 nae saal ke jashn main is saal bhi ladakiyon ko molest kiya gaya he or hameshaa kii tarah is saal bhi charchaaon ke saath hi chhedchhad karne waalon kii ninda ho rahi he
 After this incident in Bengaluru, actor Aamir Khan has described the bad thinking and thinking of boys as well as the law and system of the country behind such molestation of girls
 aamir khan ke mutabik desh kaa kamjor system or kanoon aise ladakon ko protsaahit karata he kyonki unhen aise gunaah se koi dar nahin lagata
 The comments aamir khan ne bengaluru main hui ladakiyon ke saath chhedchhad par bolte hue kaha ki 'ye jo bengaluru main huwa wo bahut bura or dukhad he
 Weak systems are behind such incidents
 agar koi chhedhkhani karata he to uski sunwaayee main or kanoonee karwaai main bahut samay lag jaataa he jisase kisi ke dil main dar nahin he aise gunaah karne se
 While countries like the US have a speedy hearing and get a sentence within a month, we do not have such a system here
 jab kade kanoon banenge or hamaare system main teji aayegi or gunahagaaron ko fatafat sajaa milegi tab log darenge aise gunaah karne se kyonki unke samaj main ajayegaa kii agar hamane kuch aisa kiya to mujhe jail kii hawa khaani padegi
 And only when the system changes will the society change

 If someone molests, it takes a lot of time to get his hearing and legal action done so that there is no fear in anyone's heart from committing such a crime
 jabaki america jaise deshon main fatafat sunwaayee hoti he or ek maheene ke bheetar sajaa mil jaati he, lekin hamaare yahaan aisa system nahin hai
 When stringent laws are enacted and our system will speed up and the guilty will be punished quickly, then people will be afraid of committing such crimes because they will understand that if we do something then i will have to eat the air of jail
 or jab system badalegaa tabhi samaaj main badlaav aayega
 ' aapako bataa den ki aamir khan ne ye baat or apane ye vichaar maharashtra ke mukhya mantri devendra fadanvis ke saamne rakhe

 The letter from economists to continue the Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA) was the result of the same skepticism that the Modi government will adopt which model for public welfare schemes? The government's half-hearted reply was that the MNREGA will continue with some changes
 isane janakalyaan kii skiimon ke modi model ko lekar uhapoh or badha di
 The question is not about the MNREGA but of the model accepted or rejected by the Congress in the last decade
 kanoonee guarantiyon se sajaa-dhaja yah model, rojgaar, shiksha or khaadya suraksha main lagu ho gaya tha or isaki safalataa-vifaltaa bhi saamne aa chuki he
 It is not for the officers but the political leadership to decide whether the constitutional guarantees will continue
 If they are to continue, they will have to accept their diseases and limitations and if they are denied, then a new structure will have to be prepared

 Many of these proposals are from the previous government, so their acceptance or denial will also be political and the policies of the states will also be affected by it

 On the other hand, despite all the calls from Modi, entrepreneurs and investors are still waiting for the next budget

 tyaagi ne kaha ki party kaa maananaa he ki sampradayik shaktiyon ko parajeet karne ke liye or dharmanirpeksh vot main or zyada vibhaajan na ho isliye party is baar chunaav nahin ladegi, lekin party ne bihar kii tarj par mahagathbandhan na banane ke liye samaajawaadee party or congress ko jimmevaar tehraaya or iske liye party ko na keval aashcharya hua balki pidaa he ki bijepi ke khilaaf gathbandhan ko vyapak banane main ye donon dal naakaam rahe
 The comments party ke is vaktavy se saaf he ki bijepi ke khilaaf gathbandhan banane main apni upeksha se party khush nahin he, lekin jaankaron kii maane to jab baithkon kaa daur chal rahaa tha tab nitish kumaar kii spasht raay thi ki samaajawaadee party kii jaisi bhoomika bihar chunaavon main rahi, us tarah ke andaaj se parhez karegi
 Certainly Janata Dal United believes that defeat is the first requirement in Uttar Pradesh if the BJP is to be prevented from coming back to power
 tyaagi ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki dharmanirpeksh party jite, jisase spasht he ki party philhal samaajawaadee party or congress kaa naam liye bina bas shubhakamanaayon tak apane role ko simit rakhaa he
 After winning the Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar addressed six rallies in Uttar Pradesh during the last eight months and after that it was being speculated that the party would field its candidates in Kurmi and Kushwaha dominated areas in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin nishchit rup se nitish kumaar ke is kadam ke baad bihar main unke satta ke sahyogi rashtriya janata dal or congress raahat kii saans lenge
 The RJD had publicly appealed not to give Nitish Kumar a candidate for the election, but also requested to campaign in favor of the Samajwadi Congress, but Nitish has conveyed his opinion to other party leaders Unilateral campaigning is irrational when the anti-bjp parties of Uttar Pradesh have never consulted them on any issue
 nitish nishchit rup se apni party ke netaaon sharad yadav or kasee tyaagi se bhi khush nahin honge jinke upar uttar pradesh main anya partiyon se talmail kaa jimmaa diya tha
 Although the party had aligned with Ajit Singh, it is now believed that under the changed circumstances, Janata Dal United has no influence in western Uttar Pradesh, which is considered to be a strong stronghold of Ajit Singh
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main janata dal united ne 219 umidavaar khadey kiye the or unamem se ek bhi uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha kaa munh nahin dekh paaya tha or adhikansh ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 It is clear from the party's statement that the party is not happy with its neglect in forming alliances against the BJP, but according to experts, Nitish Kumar had a clear opinion that the role of Samajwadi Party in Bihar elections as the meetings were going on
 Oh, i would avoid that kind of style
 nishchit rup se janata dal united kaa maananaa he ki agar bijepi ko waapas satta main aane se rokna he to uttar pradesh main haar pehali aavashyaktaa he
 Tyagi said that we want the secular party to win, so it is clear that the party has limited its role to the best wishes without naming the Samajwadi Party and Congress at present
 bihar ke chunaav main jeet ke baad nitish kumaar ne uttar pradesh main pichley aath maheenon ke dauraan chah reliyon ko sambodhit kiya tha or uske baad kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki party uttar pradesh main kurmi or kushvaha bahul kshetron main apane ummidavaar khadey karegi
 But surely after Nitish Kumar's move, his power colleagues in Bihar, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress will breathe a sigh of relief
 rajd ne saarvajanik rup se nitish kumaar ko chunaav main ummidavaar na dene kii apil kii thi, lekin samaajawaadee congress ke paksh main prachaar karne kaa anurodh bhi kiya tha, lekin nitish is baat par apni raay se party ke anya netaaon ko avgat kara diya he ki jab uttar pradesh ke bijepi virdohi dalon ne kabhi kisi mudde par unase vichaar-vimarsh nahin kiya tab ekatarfa prachaar tarkahin he
 Nitish will certainly not be happy with his party leaders Sharad Yadav and KC Tyagi, who were given the responsibility of aligning with other parties in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki ajit singh ke saath party ne gathbandhan kiya tha, lekin ab badali hui paristhitiyon main aisa mana ja rahaa he ki pashchim uttar pradesh main jise ajit singh kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he, vahaan janata dal united kaa koi prabhaav nahin he
 In the last assembly elections, Janata Dal United had fielded 219 candidates and not a single one of them could face the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly and most of the candidates lost their deposits

 On Monday, the Bharatiya Janata Party made a big charge on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying that former Prime Minister Singh had helped in giving loan of Rs 9000 crore to businessman Vijay Mallya

 Of the people who were studied on this, 23 percent of men admitted to cheating their partners
 vahiin, 19 fisadi mahilaon ne mana ki unhone apane partner ko chit kiya he
 These women admitted that they are sad to betray their partners but they can not stop themselves from doing so for the emotional strength of someone

 You will immediately find out from them that your relationship is ringing alarm bells
 
 
 washroom main phone lekar jaati hauchanak se uske man main apane phone ke liebohut pyaar umadane laga haior washroom tak main ise apane saath le jaati he
 Her phone passwords change frequently and when asked, she never gives you a clear reason for this
 yahi nahin, phone kaa istemaal bhi vah aapaki najar bachaakar karti he
 If this is the case then keep an eye on it and if you want to save the relationship then fix your behavior
 vah in dinon zyada mechap karti haijab aapane pichhali baar movie dekhne jane ke liye use achche se taiyaar hone ko kaha tha to uskaa jawaab tha ki itane close hone ke baad ab tumhaare liye is sabaki kya jarurat he
 But these days she is spending more time grooming herself, shopping new and spending more in cosmetics too, so you should focus on grooming yourself a little

 You can guess this with the help of his friend's praise in his words
 usko thodaa spes chahieham sabhi ko kuch time apane khud ke liye chahie hota he
 If the reason for staying away from you for some time explains the problems of home, stress of office, etc
 then its problem is fine

 The PDA no longer likes it, walking around holding hands at the beginning of the relationship, sharing the same ice cream, eating on a plate
 
 
 yah sab public disple of afections use bahut pasand tha
 But now everything seems childish to him
 messej main lav you, miss you kii jagah ab aupchaarik shabd zyada ho gaye hai to samaj len ki uske dil main koi or aapaki jagah le chukaa he
 She suspects that anyone of the two partners in the relationship makes a mistake or says clearly that he is cheating, often blaming the other to prove himself right
 aapke kuch bhi yun hi poochne par agar vah bifer jaati he or aap par aarope lagane lagati he to samaj jaaen ki maamle main daal kam or kaala zyada he
 On the occasion, the plan changes
 Both of you made a dinner plan or promised to meet in the coffee shop and you leave on time

 It is being said that Netanyahu is engulfed in a lot of trouble in his country, and he wants to return home after gaining something big in his long tour in India, so that the atmosphere against him is softened and with resignation and other controversies Get rid of
 bete ke kaaran mili sharmindgibharat ke daure par ravaanaa hone se pehle ek audio tepe saamne aayaa jisamen netanyahu ko 26 saal ke apane bete yir netanyahu ke kaaran sharmasaar hona padaa
 In this tape, which came a few days ago, Yair was heard asking a son of a big businessman to borrow money to do Ayyashi
 saath hi vah isamen ek khulaasa karte sune ja rahe hai ki unke pradhanmantri pita ne dost ke pita ke liye ek bada sauda (20 arab dollar) karavaaya he
 This tape is being told of 2015
 mani-menter-market kaa van stop shop icreate, modi ke CM rahete rakhi gai thi neenvatepe ke aane ke baad israel main raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 Opposition leaders there are demanding Netanyahu's resignation
 badhate vivaad ke kaaran khud netanyahu ko bete kii harakat par maafee maangate hue apni safai deni padi
 a statement issued by his office said that Netanyahu has no connection with businessman Kobi Mammon and that he did not know about his son's relationship
 baapu ke dar par netanyahu, jaaniye isroyal desh banane ke sawaal par kya kaha tha gandhiji namerica website neuyork times ne apane ek lekh main daawa kiya ki jis din netanyahu ke bete kaa audio tepe saamne aayaa, usee raat israeli sena ne syrian sainya thikanon par hawaii hamale kiye
 The New York Times claims that the prime minister assents in such an attack
 ho saktaa he ki yah hamalaa pradhanmantri ke bete ke tepe saarvajanik hone se badhate vivaad ko thaamne ke liye kiya gaya ho
 Why does Modi take his foreign guests to Gujarat only? The BJP gave this answer to the leader, but the visit, quoting his research done for the Israel Democracy Institute of Kado experts for 6 days, the New York Times writes that the Prime Minister of Israel is one of the busiest leaders in the world
 itani vyasasta ke baavjood israeli pradhanmantri bharat ke chah divasiy daure par baahar gaye hue hai
 These are slightly beyond comprehension
 duusari ore, pradhanmantri netanyahu bhi un anya israeli pradhanmantri kii tarah he jin bhrashtachar ke aarope lage hai
 Netanyahu himself has already been accused of corruption
 sthaneey media ki report ke anusaar, netanyahu par avaidh rup se gift lene ke aarope lage hai
 Also, a newspaper has been accused of getting a deal done for coverage in its favor
 un par laga ek or bhrashtachar yudhpot kharid se judaa he, jisamen germany se yudhpot kharid ke maamle main unke kareebi sahyogi bhi sandigdh bhoomika maani ja rahi he
 However according to Israeli law, unless the accused is found guilty in court, he cannot be considered a culprit
 is aadhaar par aarope lagane ke kaaran istipha dena jaruri nahin he pradhanmantri ke liye
 Netanyahu is not the first prime minister to face charges of corruption in Israel, even on wife Sarah
 kai or pradhanmantriyon par bhi bhrashtachar ke aarope lage or maamle main jaanch bhi hui
 Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had to resign in the corruption case, later he was also jailed
 ek or purv piem arial sheron kii maut bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch ke dauraan hi ho gai thi
 However, the problem with Netanyahu, the leader of the Likud party, is that even his close relatives are accused of corruption or are embroiled in controversies
 betaa yir to abhi vivaadon main aae hai lekin unki patni sara netanyahu kaa vivaadon se purana naata rahaa he
 Sara is accused of misusing the state treasury
 do din main netanyahu kaa bharat daura khatm ho jayega
 When he returns home, he has to see what the future of his politics is in his country
 unhen pad chhodana padegaa yaa phir court main apni begunaahi kaa cese ladenge

 tiktok Top 5: sapana choudhary or gulshan grover kaa Video viral, logon ko ai 'shankar bihari' kii yaad Information changes you
 galat soochna se aap dangai ban jate hai jaise aapane dekha ki uttarakhand ke agastyamuni main kaise log galat soochna ke kaaran dangai main badal gaye or dukaanon ko jala aae
 If they had tried to claim the right to know under the Right to Information, had they tried, they could have avoided becoming criminals and would not burn any shops
 mushkil yah he ki soochna kaa bazaar hi afvaahon or phek news se bhar gaya he
 Leaders sitting in constitutional positions are polluting a sacred element like information by lying
 har tarah kii soochna sandigdh he
 Meanwhile, there is a law called the Right to Information Act
 jiskaa istemaal aapako badal detaa he
 In response to your question, there is a stir within the administration, something goes wrong and you become a watchman in democracy with just one effort
 soochna ke adhikaar kaa puraa model hi is par aadhaarit he ki loktantr kaa chaukeedaar aap bane na ki koi ek bane
 Thousands of types of institutions cannot be monitored by a single watchman, this model is bound to fail
 phek to he hi
 Elections can go on as the Prime Minister said that he is a watchman in Delhi, such things are said, but everyday democracy is guarded only when the public is vigilant about the right to know
 ek sanstha se chook hoti he to koi neerav mod faraar ho jaataa he
 Be cautious about whether the information from the market from which you buy information from news channels and newspapers is honest and reliable, and also be cautious about the government institutions from which you can ask for information under the authority
 bharat main soochna ke adhikaar kaa kanoon 15 june 2005 ko paas hua tha
 That day was historic
 uske pehle yah kanoon alag-alag roopon main kuch rajyon main maujuud tha
 In Rajasthan, this law has come out from the public
 us anubhav yatra kaa ek kitaab main sankalan kiya gaya he
 'THE RTI Story', written by Aruna Roy, but she is not the only writer
 shaayad hazaron log hai jinhone kadi dhoop main khadey hokar hafton dharna diya, jansunwaayee main hissaa liya or soochna ke mahatv ko samajha, ve sab log is kitaab ko likh rahe hai yaa un sabaki kahani is kitaab main likhi ja rahi he
 Information can be sought from the government, this idea was new
 abhi tak log sarkaar se roti kapadaa or makaan maang rahe the, magar kuch karne ke khyaal se saat saal kii iees kii naukari chhodkar aruna roy, air marshall ke bete nikhil de america main pratishthit scoralishap chhodkar aate hai or ek gaanv main apana thikaana banaate hai
 Devdungari is his name
 shankar singh, anshi judate hai
 They all had an uneasiness in their mind, to do something meaningful, not for themselves, something that would change people's lives
 inke jivan kii yatra kai logon kii yatra main badal jaati he
 Hindustan gets a revolutionary law, the right to information law
 soochna se las ek aisi janata kii kalpana karne vaala kanoon jiske bare main abhi tak sochaa nahin gaya tha
 Anyone of our audience who has ever used the right to information in life is also the author and the reader of this book
 ve bhi iske lekhak hai jo soochna ke adhikaar kaa istamaal karan ke kaaran maar die gaye hai
 They are martyrs of information
 aap jaanate hai ki main jab kitaab kaa naam letaa hum, daam bhi bataata hum or prakaashak kaa naam bhi bataata hum
 It is printed by Rolly Books Publishing and the price is Rs 495
 yah kitaab angrezi main he or jaldi hi raajakmal prakaashan se hindi main aa rahi he
 Move away from this book for a minute and consider a question
 phek news ke is daur main jab media kaa bada hissaa godi or ghulaam media ho gaya he, agar aapke paas soochna ke adhikaar kaa kanoon nahin hota to kya hota
 Please consider this question seriously
 agar yah kanoon nahin hota, tab aap sarkaar ke daavon ko parakhane ke liye, sahi yaa galat sabit karne ke liye kahaan se soochna laate
 How dense the darkness would have been
 aapkaa hi data chura kar, aapako jhooth parosane kaa ek tantra viksit ho gaya he
 RTI is like a lamp, at least you can see how dense the darkness is by seeking information
 jhooth kitna he or sach kitna he
 Can the right to information be protected from fake news? jab chaaron taraf jhooth ho or press kaa bhi bharosa na ho, soochna kaa adhikaar aakhri adhikaar he, jaanane kaa
 You can buy the right information by paying money, this confusion is now broken
 bharat main bhi or duniya main bhi
 i do not know whether people associated with this law had imagined this day in their struggle journey, but as much as i have been able to read this book, it seemed that governments are a bundle of lies
 soochna ke adhikaar se hi aap sahi jaan sakate hai
 It is a law that also empowers the officers sitting inside, who are honest, and for the harassed employees, this is also the support
 har koi is kanoon kaa apane apane hisaab se istamaal kar rahaa he
 The comments is kitaab ko padhate hue aap jaan paaenge ki kaise sara khel sahi soochna kaa he
 You do not get the information of government records, we are all being crushed under this trick
 pyarji ek sarpanch kaa kissa he isamen
 When the seat of the panchayat was reserved, influential castes formed a strategy
 vahaan meghavaal jo ek dalit jati he, uski sankhya zyaada he, uske kisi ko sarpanch banane se rokane ke liye do chaar ghar vaale khatic samaaj ke kisi kii khoj hoti he
 Prem ji was selling kerosene in Surat, from there it is said that we will make you a sarpanch

 Those who had plans were not getting it
 aise prasangon se yah kitaab bhari hui he
 Meanwhile, there is a law called the Right to Information Act
 jiskaa istemaal aapako badal detaa he
 In response to your question, there is a stir within the administration, something goes wrong and you become a watchman in democracy with just one effort
 soochna ke adhikaar kaa puraa model hi is par aadhaarit he ki loktantr kaa chaukeedaar aap bane na ki koi ek bane
 Thousands of types of institutions cannot be monitored by a single watchman, this model is bound to fail
 phek to he hi
 Elections can go on as the Prime Minister said that he is a watchman in Delhi, such things are said, but everyday democracy is guarded only when the public is vigilant about the right to know
 ek sanstha se chook hoti he to koi neerav mod faraar ho jaataa he
 Be cautious about whether the information from the market from which you buy information from news channels and newspapers is honest and reliable, and also be cautious about the government institutions from which you can ask for information under the authority
 bharat main soochna ke adhikaar kaa kanoon 15 june 2005 ko paas hua tha
 That day was historic
 uske pehle yah kanoon alag-alag roopon main kuch rajyon main maujuud tha
 In Rajasthan, this law has come out from the public
 us anubhav yatra kaa ek kitaab main sankalan kiya gaya he
 'THE RTI Story', written by Aruna Roy, but she is not the only writer
 shaayad hazaron log hai jinhone kadi dhoop main khadey hokar hafton dharna diya, jansunwaayee main hissaa liya or soochna ke mahatv ko samajha, ve sab log is kitaab ko likh rahe hai yaa un sabaki kahani is kitaab main likhi ja rahi he
 Information can be sought from the government, this idea was new
 abhi tak log sarkaar se roti kapadaa or makaan maang rahe the, magar kuch karne ke khyaal se saat saal kii iees kii naukari chhodkar aruna roy, air marshall ke bete nikhil de america main pratishthit scoralishap chhodkar aate hai or ek gaanv main apana thikaana banaate hai
 Devdungari is his name
 shankar singh, anshi judate hai
 They all had an uneasiness in their mind, to do something meaningful, not for themselves, something that would change people's lives
 inke jivan kii yatra kai logon kii yatra main badal jaati he
 Hindustan gets a revolutionary law, the right to information law
 soochna se las ek aisi janata kii kalpana karne vaala kanoon jiske bare main abhi tak sochaa nahin gaya tha
 Anyone of our audience who has ever used the right to information in life is also the author and the reader of this book
 ve bhi iske lekhak hai jo soochna ke adhikaar kaa istamaal karan ke kaaran maar die gaye hai
 They are martyrs of information

 It is printed by Rolly Books Publishing and the price is Rs 495
 yah kitaab angrezi main he or jaldi hi raajakmal prakaashan se hindi main aa rahi he
 Move away from this book for a minute and consider a question

 Please consider this question seriously
 agar yah kanoon nahin hota, tab aap sarkaar ke daavon ko parakhane ke liye, sahi yaa galat sabit karne ke liye kahaan se soochna laate
 How dense the darkness would have been
 aapkaa hi data chura kar, aapako jhooth parosane kaa ek tantra viksit ho gaya he
 RTI is like a lamp, at least you can see how dense the darkness is by seeking information
 jhooth kitna he or sach kitna he
 Can the right to information be protected from fake news? jab chaaron taraf jhooth ho or press kaa bhi bharosa na ho, soochna kaa adhikaar aakhri adhikaar he, jaanane kaa
 You can buy the right information by paying money, this confusion is now broken
 bharat main bhi or duniya main bhi
 i do not know whether people associated with this law had imagined this day in their struggle journey, but as much as i have been able to read this book, it seemed that governments are a bundle of lies
 soochna ke adhikaar se hi aap sahi jaan sakate hai
 It is a law that also empowers the officers sitting inside, who are honest, and for the harassed employees, this is also the support
 har koi is kanoon kaa apane apane hisaab se istamaal kar rahaa he
 The comments is kitaab ko padhate hue aap jaan paaenge ki kaise sara khel sahi soochna kaa he
 You do not get the information of government records, we are all being crushed under this trick

 In this phase of fake news, when a large part of the media has become dock and slave media, what would happen if you did not have the right to information law
 is sawaal par aap gambhirtha se vichaar kiijie
 If this was not the law, then where would you have brought the information to test the government's claims, to prove right or wrong
 andhera kitna ghanaa hota
 By stealing your own data, a system of serving you lies has developed
 artiai ek diye ke samaan he, kam se kam aap jaankaree maang kar dekh to sakate hai ki andhera kitna ghanaa he
 How much is false and how much is true

 When there is a lie around and there is no trust of the press, the right to information is the last right to know
 aap paise dekar sahi soochna kharid sakate hai, yah bhram ab tut gaya he
 In India as well as in the world
 main nahin jaanata ki apni sangharsh yatra main is kanoon se jude logon ne is din kii kalpana kii thi yaa nahin magar is kitaab ko jitna bhi pard sakaa hum, yahi laga ki sarkarein jhooth kaa pulinda hoti hai

 They come and win the election of sarpanch and play in the hands of the Thakur caste
 jaldi hi pyaar ji samaj jate hai ki unase galat karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Those workers come to the Kisan Shakti Sangathan and say that there should be a public hearing in our village
 ek sarpanch apane hi khilaaf jansunwaayee kii maang karata he
 So that it can be free from it
 kai baar aap khud se mukt nahin ho pate hai, to dusron kii madad lete hai
 The entire game goes through which is re-examined
 ye he sahi soochna kaa asar
 Otherwise, upper caste people were taking advantage of government schemes by adding their names to the list of BPL families in their village

 Gujarat's much-talked about 'espionage' took a new turn when the woman who became the focal point of the case, along with her father, took refuge in the Supreme Court today and requested the Center and the state government to stop their investigation commissions from proceeding
 mahila ne aaj supreme court se kaha ki vah shukraguzaar he ki gujarat police uski nigaraanee kar rahi thi

 The story of Agnayya's stories is so vast, beyond time and age that you cannot ignore them
 
 
 haalanki vah ek kavi ke rup main hi charchit rahe
 Agnayya had reduced the writing of the story over time, but his plot, characters and readers were always alive in whatever he wrote
 isaki vajah thi vishay-vastu
 Agnayya used to give philosophy and story in his stories with the help of word skill that the reader would be astonished

 God is one, unbounded, and beyond religion
 dharm hamen seemaa main rakhata he, roktaa he, paramatma se alag karata he, atah hamaara shatru he
 'but someone said,' Why should we listen to the person who keeps a woman alienated and excluded? He is degenerate from society, is despicable
 'tab logon ne use samaaj-chyut karke baahar nikaal diya
 Gyan saw that one has to fight society before fighting religion
 jab tak samaaj par vijay nahin milti, tab tak dharm kaa khandan nahin ho saktaa
 Then he started doing this type of propaganda
 vah kehane laga, 'ye dharmadhwaji, ye ponge-purohit-mullah, ye koun hai? inhen kya adhikaar he hamaare jivan ko band rakhane kaa? aao, ham inhen dur kar den, ek swatantra samaaj kii rachana karen, taaki ham unnati ke path par bad saken

 One day a foreign man came to him

 There were wrinkles on the mouth, there was a sharp pain in the eyes
 usne gyaan se kaha, 'aap mujhe kuch kaam den taaki main apni rozi kama sakun

 In order to persecute him in solitude, he would always give a handful of chew and a lot of water
 dhire-dhire gyaan kaa hriday glani se bharne laga
 Life started to feel like a burden to him
 nirantar yah bhav uske bheetar jagaa karata ki main, gyaan, paramatma kaa pratinidhi, itnaa vivash hoon ki pet-bhar roti kaa prabandh mere liye asambhav he! yadi aisa he, to kitna vyarth he yah jivan, kitna chhunchha, kitna bemaani!ek din vah qile kii diwaar par chadh gaya
 Seeing the water filled in the ditch, he got an idea immediately and decided that he would lose his life by jumping into it
 paramatma ke paas lautakar prarthana karegaa ki mujhe is bhaar se mukt karo; main tumhaara pratinidhi to hoon, lekin aise sansar main meraa sthaan nahin he
 He stared into the water of the trench with a steady, enchanted vision
 vah kudane ko hi tha ki ekaek usne dekha, pani main uskaa pratibimb jhalak rahaa he or maano kah rahaa he, 'bas, apane-aapse lard chuke?'gyaan sahamkar ruk gaya, phir dhire-dhire diwaar par se neeche utar aayaa or qile main chakkar kaatane laga
 And he realized that the biggest difficulty in life is that we are constantly attracted towards ease

 It is being told that all the leaders had to go to Gandhinagar to meet with the party's potential Prime Minister Narendra Modi but Sushma Swaraj was not ready for this
 sushamaa swaraj kuch hi ghanton baad bhopal chali gayi
 There he tried his best not to make his 'disagreement' public
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'yah mahaj shishtachar mulaakaat thi
 We all wanted to meet after the election
 iskaa koi or arth na nikaala jaae
 After the Delhi exercise, Rajnath, Gadkari and Jaitley met Narendra Modi in Gandhinagar
 modi ke saath in netaaon kii baithak kareeb paanch ghante tak chali
 Earlier, before leaving for Gandhinagar, Rajnath said that he was going to share the experience of campaigning
 ' gandhinagar main rajnath ne kaha, 'yah tay he ki modi pradhanmantri banenge
 This series of mail meetings went on amid speculation about the role of Advani, the veteran leader of the party, in the formation of the government
 rajnath singh ne kaha ki is bare main party ke varisht netaaon ke dwaara faisla liya jayega, haalanki unhone is bare main kuch bhi saaf nahin kiya ki adwani niti nirdhaaran prakriya kaa hissaa honge yaa nahin
 The majority of surveys conducted by private TV channels after the election have predicted a bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) majority
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main modi kaa sthaan koun legaa, is sawaal par rajnath ne kaha, 'aapako jald isaki jaankaree mil jaaegi
 On the other hand, Gadkari said, 'atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani are our founding members, our most senior leaders
 party kaa sansadeey board uchit samay aane par uchit faisla legaa
 'he said,' Advani's guidance is very important
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya sarkaar banane ko lekar bijepi ke sahyogiyon se baatcheet chal rahi he, gadakari ne kaha, 'endie ke sahyogi dalon se abhi koi baat nahin hui he
 We have not discussed anything nor thought about it yet
 ' unhone kaha ki party ko bahumat milane kaa bharosa he or jo bhi samarthan karnaa chahta he uskaa swaagat he
 But a party leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and AIADMK would later join the alliance

 Akshay Kumar's 'padman', released on 9 February, made just 62 in 7 days
 87 karod rupee kaa bijness kiya he
 If you look at the record of Akshay's old films, then the performance of this film will be considered poor
 jabardast pramotion ke baad bhi film ko darshakon kaa kuch khaas rispons nahin mila
 Akshay's last release film 'toilet: Ek Prem Katha' touched the Rs 100 crore mark on the 8th day of its release, which is now seemingly impossible with the film in the second week
 REVIEW: period kii takalif ne banaaya 'pedman', damdaar he akshay kii film kii kahanefilm ke bajet ke bare main koi oficial anounsament nahin hui he, lekin zyaadaatar reports main to yahi kaha ja rahaa he ki film 60-65 karod rupee ke bajet main bani he
 Some reports have mentioned the budget up to Rs 80 crore
 agar film kaa bajet reports ke mutabiq he to ise box offis par flop mana ja saktaa he
 a business of Rs 62 crores was done in 7 days, it was expected that the film would do business of Rs 10-14 crores on the first day, but the film did just 10 on the first day (9 February)
 26 karod rupee kii kamai kii
 On February 10, the film made 13
 68 karod rupee, 11 farvari ko 16
 11 crores, 5 on 12 February

 pedman: jab do kalakaaron ne sainitory napkin pakadaney se kar diya tha manajbardast pramotion ke baavjood bhi nahin chali filofilm ke distribution ritis soni pikchars antertenment india ne kharida he
 The film has been released in India in around 2750 screens and 600 screens worldwide
 film ke pramotion main soni pikchars antertenment india ne koi kasar nahin chodi, lekin film kii charchaa to hui par collection main iskaa phayda najar nahin aayaa
 padmantrade analyst and Critic Komal Nahata has failed in this arithmetic of box office collection, that in the first week, the film's revenue is shared equally between producers or distributors and theaters
 yani agar pehle hafte kisi film ko 100 karod milte hai to isamen se nirmaataaon kaa hissaa aadha hota he
 But as the weeks go by, the share of producers or distributors decreases with the collection
 bharat eman collection kaa yah ganit multiplex ke aane ke baad shuru hua he
 That's why producers want the film to earn maximum in the first week itself
 jisase unhen zyada laabh ho or isi vajah se film kaa baari pramotion bhi kiya jaataa he
 Isn't Padman a film worth showing? If you look at the business of the last few films of NOC Akshay not found in Pakistan, then it will be understood that 'padman' has proved to be a flop
 kyonki pedman kii tulana main in filmon kaa bajet bahut kam tha
 See, Akshay's previous collection of films: Toilet: Ek Prem Katha: 132

 The woman accused Johri that, 'I met Rahul Johri in connection with the job

 lekin sarkaar ne is sanshodhan main bhi kuch or sanshodhan kiye hai
 Certain restrictions have been removed

 However, there are still many such screws in the bill which the government has not listened to
 bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak main jo sanshodhit bill paas hua he jaaniye usamen kiye gaye paanch mukhya sanshodhan-01
 Farming land not in scope The Modi government also included a proposal to acquire cultivable land in the first amendment
 lekin ab loksabhaa main laae gaye bill main sanshodhan kar diya gaya he
 No longer will land be acquired
 saath hi industrial corndor ke liye simit jameen liye jane kaa faisla liya gaya he
 This will provide relief to a large section of the farmers
 02
 According to the Essential Land Acquisition Act 2013, there was a provision for 80 percent farmers' approval for acquisition
 use modi sarkaar ne nae sanshodhan main khatm kar diya tha lekin ab loksabhaa main paas kiye gaye bill ke mutabik soshal infrastracchar project ke liye hone vaale adhigrahan main kisaanon kii manjuuri bhi jaruri hogi
 Similarly, the consent of the panchayat will be necessary for acquisition in tribal areas
 03
 Right to Appeal: The Modi government had abolished the right of appeal included in the 2013 Land Acquisition Act
 par ab sanshodhan ke baad aae bill main kisaanon ko apil kaa adhikaar waapas mil gaya he
 Now they will be able to appeal in any acquisition case
 isse unke adhikaron kii suraksha ko bal milegaa
 04
 milegi naukripahale chale aa rahe bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main prabhavit kisaanon ko muaavja dene kaa praavdhaan tha lekin kisi ko naukari nahin di jaati thi
 After the amendment, a bill passed in the Lok Sabha has made a provision to give job to one member of the affected family
 05
 a provision included in the Acquisition Land Acquisition Bill for the Industrial Corridor may cause trouble to those within one kilometer radius of the railway track and highway
 sarkaar ne faisla kar liya he ki industrial coridor ke liye ab railway trek or haive ke donon taraf ek kilometre tak kii jameen kaa adhigrahan kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the amended land acquisition bill, separate records will be kept for barren lands
 chaar april tak is sanshodhit bill kaa kanoon banaaya janaa jaruri he, nahin to adhyadesh radd ho jayega
 Now, if the opposition continues to oppose the bill in the Rajya Sabha, the government will have to call a joint session

 Tensions between the military and the civil government in Pakistan have once again come to the fore

 This revelation of Hashmi has made it clear that Pakistanis use civilian orders as puppets
 pakistansarkaar main 3 baar mantri rahe or desh ke varishthatam netaaon main shumaar kiye jane vaale hashmi ke is khulaase ne pakistan or isaki fouj ko puri duniya ke saamne ek baar phir benakaab kar diya he
 He said that the army has always been against democracy in Pakistan and never let it settle down
 sarkarein giraati rahi hai faujamultan main ek press conference mempakistani foujor generalon kii pole kholte hue hashmi ne kaha ki pakistani fouj hameshaa se chuni hui sarkaron ko giraati rahi he
 Accusing the army, Javed Hashmi said, "I am a witness to the fact that for the last 5 years the army has been trying to topple Nawaz Sharif's government
" 'fouj ko sidhi chetavanee dete huemuslim ligake varisht netaa javed hashmi ne kaha, 'ek samay aayega jab tum haath jodoge or koi bhi hukumat main nahin aana chahega
 Pakistan's community has woken up

 Taking a dig at the army chief, questioning the role of the army, he said, "sir, Asakari Qayadat saheb, will come from Punjab, will come from Balochistan, will rise from KPK
" karachi or sindh se uthegi, aaj nahin to kal uthegi
 Even if you give the post of Wazir by placing it on the plate, nobody will accept it
 aapako ek din apane hi log hi bolenge ki vardi pahanakar multan kaint main bhi nahin janaa
 Javed Hashmi questioned the army, what role did the army of Pakistan play in the creation of Pakistan? He said that the Pakistan Army has a misconception that the Pakistan Army is the mother of Pakistan
 sachai yah he ki wo desh ke maalik nahin he
 Not only did Pakistan lose every war with India, Javed Hashmi also questioned the capability of Pakistan Army and said that Pakistan had to face defeat in 5 wars from India due to poor tactics of military generals
 javed hashmi ke anusaar, '80 fisadi faujee generalon ne apni kitabon main likhaa he ki sabhi 5 jangon kii shuruyaat pakistan ne kiye or sabhi main bharat se shikast khaani padi
 Former Pakistan minister Hashmi also described the Pakistan Army as involved in corruption
 unhone daawa kiya ki pakistan ke purv army chif raahil sharif or general kayaani ke paas kai plot hai or vartmaan army chif jab jaaenge to unke bhi jameen kaa khulaasa ho jayega
 a case of treason against Musharraf, supporting the statement of Mumbai attack on Nawaz Sharif, former Pakistan minister Javed Hashmi claimed that whatever Nawaz said was true
 or agar unke khilaaf deshadroh kaa cese karnaa he to usase pehle pakistan ke purv raashtrapati general parvej musharraf ke khilaaf maamla darj ho
 He said that today Pakistan has become a terrorist country and the army is fully responsible for it

 The infighting in the ruling AAP of Delhi has continued since the announcement of Rajya Sabha election dates

 This was one army rule we all strictly lived by, through the Shoot of the Film
 Once in costume, each and every one of us was responsible for our own gears
 You wear them or hold them, it's going to be with you through the span of the shoot for that day
 Our pockets would be full of protein bars, nuts and bags with bottles of energy drinks, because deep in those jungles sometimes no food trolleys or spot team were allowed to reach
 Somedays i would wake up with my right index finger already bent imitating to pull the trigger
 Those night shoots full of intense action, ofcourse were peppered with some fun banter and laughs in between shots amongst the boys, where our director @adityadharfilms would also join us
 All of this feels worth it, with the generous love the Film is getting from you all
 We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for keeping the Josh so high
 Also, a big shout out to the wonderful set of co-actors i got to work with, that formed our SF team
