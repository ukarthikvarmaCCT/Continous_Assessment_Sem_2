 But the Congress seems to have had no choice

 In this sense, Sheila Dixit's face fit

 The condition of the Congress in Delhi is currently at zero

 However, there are many people in Congress who believe that Congress and Aam Aadmi Party should come together to defeat BJP in Delhi
 magar shila dikshit aisa nahin maanati hai
 In a way, he has opened a front against the Aam Aadmi Party
 shila dikshit maanati hai ki dilli main congress kaa paramparaagat vot he
 He only needs to inspire

 In this direction, the next day of swearing in, the Modi government came together
 kisaanon mazdooron ko pension to ab rojgaar ke liye survey shuru ho gaya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi drew the slogan of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas with everyone to reach a new line of trust
 abhi chunaav to beete hi hai jab desh ke karodon naujavaanon kii ankhon main ye sapane tair rahe the ki modi sarkaar dobaaraa aegi to rojgaar aayega, unki udhaas duniya main khushiyon kaa nayaa savera aayega
 However, the government has already claimed that the situation has improved a lot in the last five years itself
 piem modi kah chuke hai ki main bahut santusht hum, aarthik sthiti se ye koi mudda hi nahin he, lekin sankat to he
 That is why the Modi government, surrounded by rising unemployment and job crisis, has started taking a big decision and preparing for an economic survey soon
 yah surveykshan pehali baar thele, rehadi, or apana rojgaar karne vaale logon ko vikaas kii mukhya dhara main laane ke liye karaayaa jayega or isko itani jaldi main karnaa he ki ye june ke aakhri hafte main hi shuru ho saktaa he
 According to the information received by sources from Aaj Tak, its objective is to clear the condition of seven crore unorganized jobs in the country by January 2020, in six months
 sarkaar in aankadon ke aadhaar par rojgaar ko lekar bhavishya kii ranneeti taiyaar karegi or is kaam ke liye bani cameti main pradhanmantri modi, grih mantri amit shah, vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman samet 10 mantri hai
 This committee will also work on the issue of unemployment
 vaise 30 may ko duusari baar hindustan kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne jo pehali cabinet baithak bulaai usamen tabadatod kai bade bade faisle liye gaye
 It was decided that under the Shramik Samman Yojana, organized laborers, farmers and small traders will get a pension of 3000 per month
 iske liye 18 saal kii umr main unhen 55 rupee maheenaa dena hoga jabaki 29 saal kii umr main 100 rupee
 However, before the elections and even after the election, the BJP kept saying that unemployment is not an issue as it has been resolved
 amit shah ne kaha tha ki berogari or mahangaai par koi charchaa nahin kyonki hamane usape bahut kaam kiya he
 But the truth sometimes shows a second mirror
 berogari badi chunautipichley saal farvari main rajyasabha main die gaye sarkaar ke ek bayaan ke mutabik centre or rajya sarkaron main kareeb 24 lakh pad khaali pade hai
 Of these, only one million posts are vacant in the education department

 However, in front of all ministers, the Prime Minister has made clear the goals and challenges
 desh ko tej gati se vikaas ke raste par le jane ke liye jo bhi jaruri he, use fouran kiya jaae
 Including Sitharaman and Piyush Goyal - Second committee created to boost employment opportunities - This committee will also have 10 ministers, including the Prime Minister and Amit Shah - The third committee created for accelerating skill development programs is concerned about unemployment Modi- For the first time an economic survey is going to be conducted on street-tracks and self-employment - The report of this survey to be started in June by January 20120 Agi - After this, policy will be made on 7 crore people in the unorganized sector

 is baar pradhanmantri ke kaam karne kaa andaaj bhi badla hua he
 This time, they are eyeing only and only results, and have been monitoring the work and the results of the ministers from day one
 maharashtra main siyaasi halchal tejaianchhf-congress-shivasena main ban sakati he batbijepi bhi banaae hue he halaat par najrasansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ke pehle din sadan khatm hone ke baad sharad pavaar sidhe congress ke sabase bade power centre 10 janpath pahunche
 There was a strong news in the media that Sharad's last round of talks with Sonia was going on to form the government in Maharashtra
 har kisi ko isi baat kii ummid thi ki agenda tay hoga, nunatam saajha kaarykram tay hoga
 But after the meeting, Sharad Pawar went straight to his house and held a press conference
 sharad pavaar ne iske baad sidhe gugali phenki, jisase sarkaar banane kii atakalein siyaasi pich par naachati nazar ain
 What did Sharad Pawar say in the press conference? 
 
 press conference main sharad pavaar ne kaha ki maharashtra main sarkaar banane ko lekar sonia gandhi se hamaari koi baat nahin hui he
 Then the question came that Shiv Sena is speaking, you are with them
 lekin sharad pavaar ne kaha ki main sabhi ke saath hum, aapke bhi saath hum
 As far as the government is concerned, the Shiv Sena has given a statement and ask them
 ab aage kya?jo log bhi sharad pavaar kii siyasat ko jaanate hai unhen achche se pataa he ki unka dahinaa haath kya karata he, wo baayen ko bhi pataa nahin hota he
 Obviously, this can also be Pawar's strategy
 lekin teji se badalte raajnneetik ghatnakram or bayaan par najar daalen to khel kuch fansata najar aa rahaa he
 For this, it is necessary to look closely at Sanjay Raut's statement
 maharashtra main sarkaar banane ko lekar shivasena kii ore se talwaar bhanj rahe sanjay raut ne bhi congress-ensipi se samjhaute kii koshishon ke bich hairaan karne vaali baat kah daali
 After meeting Sharad Pawar, Sanjay Raut said that it is not our responsibility to form the government, those who are responsible are running away
 saath hi unhone kataaksh bhi kiya ki sharad pavaar ko samajhane main kai janm lagenge
 Now the question is, who are those who are running away? Not only this, on his second day, Sanjay Raut again made a very big and already very important statement
 unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main do took kaha ki unki party saavarkar ko bharat ratna dene ke samarthan main pehle bhi thi or aage bhi rahegi
 Read this: Shiv Sena will stop Modi's dream project? It is a matter of mentioning that the CMP stopped funding the bullet train, a meeting of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP leaders was held in Mumbai last week
 kaha ja rahaa tha ki ye netaa nunatam saajha kaarykram ko lekar charchaa kar rahe hai
 The matter came out sarcastically and it was said that the Congress wants the Shiv Sena to change the image of its staunch Hindutva, put Savarkar on the back burner like Bharat Ratna
 raajnneeti ko thodi bhi samaj rakhane vaala vyakti ye aasaani se samaj saktaa he ki saavarkar ko bharat ratna dene kaa samarthan karne vaali party ko congress bhala kaise kabool kar legi? tab kya ye maan liya jaae ki sarkaar banane kii raah main koi roda aa gaya he
 What is the attitude of Shiv Sena? Shiv Sena got stuck in the most difficult issue in this matter
 bijepi ke saath lambey samay kaa rishta tod kar congress or shivasena ke saath sarkaar banane kii ekatarfa ghoshnaa uski taraf se kii gai
 Sanjay Raut has even resigned from the Center to his minister, Sanjay Raut is talking about new government, new path, new morning, but after the statement of Sharad Pawar, the fog about forming the government does not seem very clear
 bijepi par roj karaara waar kar rahi shivasena is raah par itani aage aa chuki he ki uske lieyu-turn bhi thodaa mushkilhai
 Meanwhile, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray is scheduled to hold a meeting with mlas on 22 November
 mana ja rahaa he ki isamen shivasena kii aage kii ranneeti saaf ho paaegi
 The Congress high command has not yet made any statement on its behalf to form the government with the Congress's Kashmashiv Sena
 shivasena ke daawey par bhi abhi tak kisi bhi bade netaa ne sthiti spasht nahin kii he
 However, ideologically it is not so easy for the Congress to support the Shiv Sena standing on the other axis of politics, its position is completely different from the NCP
 congress party kaa pan india impact he, agle saal bihar main chunaav hona he vahiin kerala congress ke agenda main he
 Rahul Gandhi himself is now an MP from Wayanad
 aise main maharashtra main shivasena ke saath congress kaa gathbandhan itnaa aasaan nahin hone vaala he
 bjp's next step: In Maharashtra, by contesting elections with Shiv Sena, even after getting majority, BJP sitting out of power is keeping a close watch on the political situation
 kendriya netaa puure maamle par sanjidagi barat rahe hai
 Avoiding any harsh and bigoted statement directly on Shiv Sena
 maujuuda daur kii kadavaahat ke bich devendra fannavis ne bal thakare kii samadhi par jaakar shradhanjali arpit kii
 Amit Shah himself just said that the new condition of Shiv Sena is not acceptable to us
 haalanki maharashtra ke sthaneey netaaon kii taraf se siyaasi bayaanbaji bhi jari he
 Narayan Rane created a sensation a few days ago by saying that we will form the government
 sam, daam, dand, bhed kii raah hamen shivasena ne hi dikhaai he
 Overall, the situation in this Mahabharata of Maharashtra is not yet clear who will prove to be the abhimanyu of this political cycle and who will become Krishna of this great war! bhaajapa ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki congress 'achhut' hoti ja rahi he or party ke itihaas main pehali baar loksabhaa chunaav main vah do ankon kii sankhya tak simat jaaegi
 The BJP also indicated that more parties would join the NDA in the next few days
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa em venkaiya naidu ne kaha, 'ek vakt tha jab log bhaajapa ko achhut party kah rahe the
 But now the situation has changed
 congress asprishy hoti ja rahi he or narendra modi janata ke priy hai
 Therefore, a large number of people are joining the NDA
 ' purv party adhyaksh naidu ne daawa kiya ki bhaajapa ko is baar ke chunaavon main sarvaadhik siten milengi
 On the meeting of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Imam Bukhari, he said that the Congress is undoubtedly the most communal party and has promoted organizations like Muslim League, SIMI and communal leaders like Madni and Imam Bukhari
 naidu ne kaha ki yah mulaakaat congress kii is hataasha ko jhalkaati he ki vah chunaavon main dhruvikaran karnaa chaahati he
 The crime branch team involved in the investigation of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari murder is also focused on Rohit's wife Apoorva

 Apart from this, samples of nails of two servants living in the house have also been sent for examination
 apurva par he krime branch kaa fonesrohit hatyakand kii jaanch main aage kai ahm khulaase ho sakate hai

 Who was the person who strangled her? ab police isse sambandhit jaanch report kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 After leaving home, the crime branch came to know that there was a big fight between Rohit and Apoorva about a month before Rohit's murder
 iske baad gusse main apurva ghar chhod kar apane maayke chali gai thi
 She came back to Rohit 15 days ago
 itnaa hi nahin
 It is said that the divorce of both of them was going on, which was to be decided in June next month

 Then on 12 May 2018, Rohit and Apoorva got married

 The controversy started after some time, soon after the marriage, a quarrel started between Rohit and Apoorva
 rohit kii maa ke mutabik apurva aksar rohit se ladati thi or use pareshaan karti thi
 Apoorva had a quarrel with Rohit about his relationship with a woman
 ujjwala kaa ilzaam he ki unke donon bete rohit or siddharth kii property par apurva kii najar thi
 Faisalharit's mother Ujjwala, who was to be divorced in June, said that there was talk of divorce between Rohit and his wife Apoorva for some time
 jab bhi aapas main jhagada hota tha to is bare main baat hoti thi
 After several discussions about divorce, it was decided that it would be decided in June
 miyaan-bivi main pichley maheene bhi jhagada hua tha
 Apoorva was in her maternal home from March 3 to 29 after the quarrel
 iske baad apurva 30 march ko waapas dephence colony ai thi
 Ujjwala's allegation: After the death of veteran Congress leader ND Tiwari, who was the chief minister of Apoorva and Uttarakhand CM, Rohit was the heir of all his properties
 rohit kii maa ujjwala kaa aarope he ki apurva or uskaa parivaar rohit kii tamaam jaaydaad ko hadapna chahta tha
 Rohit used to sleep in different rooms
 Not only is there an angle in this case, there is also an angle that Apoorva had a boyfriend before marriage

 At the same time, Apurva and Rohit used to sleep in different rooms
 donon ke bich ab sambandh keval naam maatr ke the

 Police claim, murder for robbery: Two accused arrested, the case of the murder of Azad, branch manager of Ghaziabad branch of Tamancha Baramadamuthoot Finance, was uncovered on 20 June
 greater noida police ne hatya main prayukt hathiyaar baraamad karne kaa daawa karte hue kaha kishakha prabandhak kii hatyammere bhai ne hi lut ke iraade se karai thi
 Police arrested two accused and sent them to jail, while two are said to be absconding
 giraftaar aropiyon ke paas se ek tamancha, do jinda kaartoos ke saath hi mritak kaa matadaata pahchaan patr, bajaj finance ke card bhi baraamad kiye gaye hai
 According to information received from the police, Azad's maternal brother, Parvinder, had borrowed Rs 10,000 from him
 vah udhaar kaa paisa aaazaad ko lautaanaa nahin chahta tha
 Parvinder also knew that the key to the locker (which housed the jewelery) of the branch of Muthoot Finance remains with Azad
 parivinder ne loker se jevar luutane ke iraade se uski hatya kii yojana bana di
 On June 20, while Azad was going home from the branch, Parvinder also joined him
 parivinder or uske saathi chamanlal, deepak, sunil aaazaad ke saath sharaab pine lage
 As part of the plan, Chamanlal, Deepak and Sunil went to the branch with the intention of robbing Azad's bag and key and when the lock of the branch did not open in any way, he returned and informed Parvinder
 is baat kii bhanak aaazaad ko bhi lag gai thi or usne isaki soochna police ko dene ke saath hi panchayat bulaane kii baat kahi
 Due to this, the four who came in the can, did Azad kathal and threw the body near the canal of Kalda village and parked their bikes on the way and went to their respective homes
 maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi police ne suraag ke aadhaar par dadri ke maripat stesan ke paas se chamanlal or parivinder ko giraftaar kar liya, vahiin deepak or sunil kii talash kii ja rahi he
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Laluprasad Yadav's elder son Tej Pratapayadava and younger son Wabihar's former deputy chief minister Tejasviyadhav have often been publicly exposed
 jise lekar hone vaale sawaalon ko tejasvi va tej pratap sire se khaarij karte rahe hai
 But now the member of the Lalu family has not denied any dispute between the two brothers
 lalu yadav kii beti or rajyasabha saansadmisabharti ne apane donon bhaaiyon tejasvi yadav va tej pratap yadav ke rishton ko lekar bada bayaan diya he
 On the question of not getting everything right between the two brothers, Misa Bharti has asked where the estrangement does not happen
 maner main yojit litti-chokha party ke dauraan jab misa bharti se donon bhaaiyon ko lekar sawaal kiya gaya to unke jawaab ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 He clearly said that where there is little pique
 apane is jawaab ko samajhane ke liye misa ne ek udhaaharan bhi diya
 He said that 'the five fingers of the hand are not equal
 'apane parivaar main manmutav kii baat ko sweekaarte hue misa bharti argedy yani apane dal ke parivaar ke bare main baat karne lageen
 He said that Rashtriya Janata Dal is a very big family
 iske alaava misa ne sajishon kaa bhi hawala diya
 He said that no opponent comes from the front, everyone shoots daggers from behind
 misa ne kaha ki saamne aakar koi lade to ham jhaansi kii rani kii tarah lard lenge, jabaki peeth main koi khanjar maaregaa to ham bardaasht nahin karenge
 Just before the Delhi Assembly elections, 2015, the Central Government has given a big gift to the millions of people living in illegal colonies of Delhi
 kendriya cabinet ne faisla kiya he ki ab 1 june, 2014 tak dilli main bani sabhi avaidh coloniyaan niyamit kii jaaengi
 Colonies up to March 31, 2002 were being regularized, but now according to the decision of the Cabinet, about 895 more colonies of Delhi will be benefited
 vittamantri arun jetali ne bataaya ki pehle jo katof date 31 march, 2002 tay thi, use ab 1 june, 2014 tak badha diya gaya he or isko phayda 895 coloniyon ko milegaa
 It is true that the government has given great relief to the millions of people living in illegal colonies, but apart from this, some other facts should also be known
 sitambar, 2012 main jab dilli main congress sarkaar thi, usne nagar nigam chunaav haarane ke baad 895 avaidh coloniyon ko niyamit kar diya tha, lekin ve coloniyaan keval kagaz par niyamit huin
 The infrastructure that those colonies wanted could not be found, because shortly after the elections were held and the government went away and the new Aam Aadmi Party government did not last two months and went away and since then there has been President's rule in Delhi
 yani, ve coloniyaan aaj bhi practikali niyamit hone kii baat joh rahi hai
 The central government has not put forward any roadmap for these newly regularized 895 colonies, but just before the elections, the BJP government's intention is that it is taking this step to woo millions of voters living in illegal colonies
 , But he should also keep in mind that the Congress government also campaigned a lot by regularizing 895 colonies and tried to placate the voters living in illegal colonies, but Public Unav rejected him
 lekin ek baat or bataane vaale dikh rahi he or vah yah he ki shaayad ab dilli main koi bhi colony avaidh nahin rah jaaegi
 There is underworld in Mumbai, but it is always said about Delhi that no big gang ever flourishes here
 yaa yun kahen ki use panpane hi nahin diya gaya
 But at present, the view on the streets of Delhi NCR is that it shows the bloody battle of Mumbai underworld

 In a few moments the car gets out of the petrol pump while a bike is seen coming there
 safed bike par do log savaar hokar aate hai
 The motorcycle comes close to the pump, when a black bike enters it behind it
 us bike par bhi do log savaar the
 The pistol used to kill the first white bike does not stop at the pump
 balki dhime dhime aage badhane lagati he
 His stand was probably the office of a petrol pump
 tabhi duusari motorcycle pump ke paas aakar rukne lagati he
 Suddenly the person sitting backwards on that bike comes into action
 wo bike se neeche utarkar saamne kii taraf lapakata he
 The pistol in his hand is clearly visible
 or wo pistaul se nishaanaa sadhate hue apni dahini taraf kaa rukh kar letaa he

 lekin australian team ko bhartiya fielderon se bahut phayda mila, jinhone kam se kam chah kaich chode or maidani kshetrarakshan bhi lachar rahaa

 But the rain stopped
 shami apana spel karne utre or unhone shen watasan (14) ko finch kii tarah bold kiya
 Although Unadkat was unable to move the ball, Shami achieved it at a good pace, making it difficult for the Australian team to score runs in the mandatory powerplay, scoring four runs per over

 The US policy of wanting to expand India's role in the war-torn Afghanistan can become an opportunity for New Delhi, under which it can form Afghanistan with the US, as the neighboring country wants for itself, as well as This policy also indicates to Pakistan that its role in this matter is no longer as strong as before

 lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki trump ne bharat ko afghanistan main vartmaan ke mukaable or badi bhoomika nibhaane kii chunauti di he

 There is no vote bank, everything Kejriwal said that we do not see everything as a vote bank because by thinking like this we will not be able to work for the benefit of the people
 yadi ham sirf vot bank ke bare main chintit rahete or paramparaagat raajnneeti par hi dhyaan dete to ham sam-visham yojana ko lagu nahin kar pate
 The Chief Minister said that the success of the scheme has increased our belief that even if people are taken along, difficult tasks can be handled
 logon ko jaagruk karnaa he jaruricageriwal ne kaha ki is yojana ke peeche koi vot bank kii raajnneeti nahin rahi he, na hi iskaa makasad pradooshan mukt dilli ke liye ek or naare ko lokapriy bananaa tha
 People went beyond the party line and all the members of the society praised this plan
 unhone kaha ki yah kaam karne ke do tareeke the
 We could have seized every vehicle that violated the rule by announcing the rule, but it was certainly not a viable solution
 hamen janata ko jaagruk karnaa tha or unhen saath lekar chalanaa tha taaki log khud hi iskaa paalan karen
 This scheme will not be implemented on Sunday, it is worth mentioning that the Delhi government has started the odd-even scheme from January 1 as an experiment to curb the pollution caused by vehicles
 is yojana ke tahat sam taarikh ko sam registration number vaali nijee kaaren or visham tarikhon ko visham registration number vaali nijee kaaren chalaai ja sakati hai
 Both types of private cars can be run on Sundays
 yah yojana philhal 15 janvari tak hi lagu kii gai he
 It is usually that only men from the family of Kimulayam Singh live in the news, but now there is also a woman who is speaking to be heard
 duusari baar saansad chuni gayi mukhyamantrikhilesh yadavaki patni ko unke nijee bayanon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 But Aparnane, the wife of Akhilesh's brother Prateek, has chosen a different path
 haal hi main aparnaa ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke svachh bharat abhiyaan kii tarif karke kaiyon kii naaraazgi mol lee
 This is the reason why there is silence on Aparna's statement from the Mulayam family, no one opened his mouth
 kaha to yah bhi ja rahaa he ki aparnaa ke bayaanyadav parivaar main satta ke liesangharsh kaa nateeja he, or aparnaa ke pati pratik yadav parivaar kii siyaasi viraasat main apana share chaahate hai
 During the Lok Sabha elections, a group of SP activists took to the streets to give Prateek Yadav a ticket from Ajamgarh
 vivaad zyada naa ho lihaaja mulaayam singh khud hi azamgarh se chunavi maidan main utre

 inke sabake bich pratik ko apni jagah banane ke liye mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Seeing her husband sidelined, Aparna took the front
 25 saal kii aparnaa hameshaa dimple yadav ke saae main hi rahi he
 But while praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he introduced his cleverness and described his earnest as personal
 aparnaa ne kaha, 'sabhi ko apane vichaar rakhane chahie, main ek saamaajik kaaryakarta hum, party kii koi sadsy nahin
 After Aparna's statement, SP workers also reached 5, Vikramaditya Marg regarding the matter
 gauratlab he ki aparnaa or pratik ne is saal kii shuruyaat main apni raajnneetik aakankshaon ko khulkar jaahir kiya tha
 During a press conference at the party office in August, Aparna did not rule out her chances of entering politics
 unka kahana tha, 'main raajnneetik vigyaan kii student rahi hum or pati ke bijnesaman hone ke baavjood raajnneeti main aa sakati hum
 After this, after the death of Mahant Avaidyanath in September, Aparna went to Gorakhpur and met Yogi Adityanath
 pichley maheene, pehali baar mulaayam kii choti bahu ne sapa ke rashtriya kanvension main hissaa liya or dimple ke thik peeche baithi
 At the same time, earlier this month, Aparna praised Prime Minister Modi and chose the road to Dubai, leaving the controversial birthday celebrations of Mulayam Singh in Rampur last week
 duusari ore sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav bahuon ko raajnneeti main laane ke icchhuk nahin he
 But in Dimple's case, he had to obey Akhilesh
 or ab jabaki aparnaa raajnneeti main entry ke liye dastak de rahi hai, mulaayam daravaaje ko band nahin rakh sakate
 Dimple's posters and hoardings in the party office are now part of the routine

 ye FIR ipisi kii dhara 354 or 509 ke tahat darj karai he
 a copy of the text of Tanushree Dutta's statement to the police is available with India Today
 tanushri datta ne apane bayaan main kaha- “2008 main nirdeshak rakesh saarang or nirmaataa sami siddiki ne mujhase film ‘horn oke’ main item song karne ke liye sampark kiya
 In March (2008) the song was being shot at Filmistan Studio in Goregaon
 gane ke coreographer ganesh acharya the
 The director and producer told me Kinana Patekar is also acting in the film but in this song i have to perform alone
 unhone mujhe ye bhi bataaya ki naanaa patekar kii bhi ek line hogi lekin use baad main shoot kiya jayega or wo meri coreography kaa hissaa nahin he
 Before the shooting, i had clearly stated that i will not take any indecent, vulgar or inconvenient steps
 gane ko chaar din main shoot kiya janaa tha
 Nana Patekar did not have any role in the song but he was still present on the set all four days
 chauthe din, jab vahaan kareeb 100 log maujuud the, naanaa patekar ne mujhe gane ke steps sikhaane ke bahaane se tach kiya
 He touched me in a very somber manner
 wo coreographer bhi nahin the
 Everyone else remained a mute spectator
 unhone baaki sabhi kalakaaron or coreographer ko alag rahane ke liye kaha
 It was very embarrassing and hurt my identity
 maine tatkaal isaki shikaayat coreographer, nirmaataa or nirdeshak se kii
 i thought everything would be perfect
 baad main mujhe set par ye bataane ke liye bulaayaa gaya ki kuch nae steps jode gaye hai or mujhe naanaa patekar ke saath antarang steps karne honge
 i was informed by Ganesh Acharya about the addition of dance sequences
 naanaa patekar, ganesh acharya, sami siddiki or rakesh saarang ne set par saajha meeting kii or antarang dance sikvence ko jodne kaa faisla kiya
 They were all pushing me to do those intimate steps with Nana Patekar
 kyonki main iskaa lagaataar virodh kar rahi thi to unhone kaha ki ve meraa boycott karenge or media ke saamne badnaam kar denge
 i left the set and went to my vanity van
 mujhe ye bardaasht nahin tha ki har koi naanaa patekar kaa samarthan kar rahaa tha or mujh par antarang steps karne ke liye dabaav daalaa ja rahaa tha
 i called my father
 naanaa patekar set se chale gaye or shoot khatm ho gaya
 As soon as i got out of the vanity van, i noticed that there was a huge crowd and MNS party slogans were being raised
 party ke kaaryakarta hinsak ho uthe or naanaa patekar ke samarthan main unhone meri car par hamalaa shuru kar diya
 i went to the Goregaon Police Station to lodge a complaint but nothing was taken as part of my FIR
 haal main maine news channel par ek intervyuu dekha jisamen sami siddiki ko kehete suna ki mere periods chal rahe the isliye main set chhodkar chali gai thi
 This is further hurting my identity and embarrassing in public

 It is very worrying to take the law into the hands of the mob and rage and kill the accused in a case

 sirf nyaayalay hi de saktaa he sajaagar koi vyakti kisi maamle main aaropee he, to usko sirf court hi nyaayik prakriya kaa paalan karte hue doshi tehra or sajaa de saktaa he
 Except the court, no other person or institution or group has the right to convict and punish a person accused of a crime
 agar koi vyakti, samooh yaa sanghathan aisa karata he, to vah aparaadh he, jiske liye usko sajaa bhugatni hogi
 It is often seen that the accused in a case is acquitted

 They say that if someone is beaten to death by a mob, a case will be registered under Section 302 of the IPC and Section 34 or 149 will be imposed together
 iske baad jitne log bhi mob linching main shaamil rahe honge un sabko hatya kaa doshi tehraaya jayega or faansee yaa aaajeevan karawas se dandit kiya jayega
 Apart from this, fines can also be imposed on all
 markandeya pant kaa kahana he ki agar bheed kaa koi bhi shaks kisi bhi aparaadh ko anjaam detaa he, to us aparaadh ke liye bheed main shaamil sabhi log doshi honge
 Also, everyone will have to bear different punishment for that crime

 karnataka main congress or jedies ke baagi vidhayakon ne vidhaan sauda se lekar supreme court tak puraa jor laga diya ki unka istipha hi manjuur ho
 At no cost should they be disqualified
 jab sadsyta donon hi sthitiyon main jaani he to un par kya fark pad rahaa he
 Why has he tried his best to get the speaker to accept his resignation? sarkaar ke saath-saath spikar bhi isi jugat main lage hai ki ayogy tehra kar baat khatm kar di jaae
 Actually, the legislators have now resorted to the sword of law, then the speaker has also laid down the rules
 unka kahana he ki samvidhan kii dasvin anusuchee main spikar kii shaktiyon, adhikaron or maryaada ke saath-saath kaary karne kii prakriya kaa puraa vistaar se zikr he
 According to this, before any MLA resigns, the speaker must satisfy himself before accepting that the resignation is not being given for any pressure, influence, greed, greed or political bargaining
 is jaanch padtaal main vakt to lagata hi he, lihaaja court kii ore se bataae gaye samay main yah nahin ho saktaa, isamen der to lagegi
 Rebel mlas say that all this is wrong, the real purpose of the speaker is to somehow disqualify it by encircling it
 vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki hamaari kursi kii aas bhi khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 In fact, the reality of this political bet is the ministerial position
 siyasat ke ghamad ye bataa rahe hai ki dalbadal nirodhak kanoon or vidhanmandal karyprakriya niyamavali ke mutabik jis dal ke tikat par chunaav jeet kar vidhayak yaa saansad mananeey bane hai, us dal ke vip or niyam sadan main maanane padenge
 Regardless of the defection law, if a legislator or MP rebels and resigns, his membership will be lost
 phir chaahe wo duusari party jwoin kare yaa nahin, vidhayaki to gai
 The screw is stuck on disqualification because if the MLA is disqualified under the defection law, then he will have to prove his merit again only by winning the election
 asli samasya to kumaraswami kii sarkaar girane ke baad agali sarkaar main mantri pad ko lekar he
 Because if there is a legislature, it does not matter if you will get a ministerial position in the next government
 ayogy ghoshit hone ke baad to pehle chunaav jitkar aao phir mantri pad paao
 At the same time, after resigning and losing the legislature, there is no problem in becoming a minister
 baghawat bhi to mantri pad ke liye hi kii he, yahaan ek pal kaa intjaar bardaasht nahin udhar kanoon he ki chah maheene yaa phir chunaav jeetne kii baat kah rahaa he
 It is easy to win elections after becoming a minister, but it is even more painful to lose the legislature and go back to the public from the same area and overcome this charge of opponents
 supreme court main to mukhyamantri kumaraswami ne bhi kah diya ki istipha dene waalon main se kai par to bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope hai
 This is because they are changing the ground so that the investigation going on against them comes to an end

 The 69-year-old Musharraf ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's elected government from power through a bloodless coup, and imposed an emergency in 2007, suspending the constitution, Xinhua reported
 aantarik mantri choudhary nisaar ali khan ne kaha ki do baar samvidhan kaa ulanghan karne ke kaaran musharraf par rajdroh kaa mukadmaa chalegaa
 "the government of Pakistan will appeal to the Supreme Court on Monday that the Chief Justice should constitute a three-member commission for the sedition case," Khan said in a press conference
 unhone kaha ki sangheey jaanch agency dwaara taiyaar ek report ko nyaayalay ke samaksh pesh kiya jayega
 Legal experts believe that if Musharraf is convicted of treason, he could face the death penalty or life imprisonment
 navaj sharif ne satta main aane ke baad june main neshnal assembly main kaha tha ki musharraf par rajdroh kaa maamla chalaaya jayega

 ipel ke 10wein sijan main aakhirkaar ek vivaad ne us vakt janm le hi liya jab mumbai indiens ke olerounder cyron pollard purv bhartiya cricketer or comentator sanjay manjrekar par bhadak gaye or unke khilaaf twitor par kaaphi kuch likh daalaa
 What was the whole matter? In fact, when Kairan Pollard came to bat against Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians, Comanator Sanjay Manjrekar said something that provoked him against Pollard
 sanjay manjrekar ne pollard kii ballebaaji ke dauraan unki ballebaaji or upareekram main unako ballebaaji karaane ke mudde par kaha ‘pollard ke paas upree kram main ballebaaji kii samaj nahin he, wo sirf aakhri 6 over main hi acchhee ballebaaji kar sakate hai
 During the commentary, Kayron Pollard was furious at this comment of Sanjay Manjrekar and wrote a lot against Sanjay Manjrekar on his Twitter account
 pollard ne likhaa ‘tumhen lagata he ki jo tum kah rahe ho wo sahi he kyonki tumhen bolne ke paise milte hai, tum apana badbolapan jari rakh sakate ho
 '@sanjaymanjrekaru feel any positive can come out of your mouth bcuz u get pay to talk u can continue with your verbal diarrhea
 
 - Kieron Pollard (@ kieronpollard55) April 9, 2017 In his second tweet, Pollard responded by writing to Sanjay Manjrekar, 'you know how i have grown so much 


 Stupidly 


 words are very powerful once you get out of your mouth
 Then you cannot take them back
 ’do you know how i get big so
 
 about BRAINLESS
 
 words are very powerful 
 
 once it leaves u can't take it back
 
 sins of parents fall on
 
 
 - Kieron Pollard (@ kieronpollard55) April 9, 2017 It is worth noting that in the first match of Mumbai this season, Pollard scored 27 runs in 17 balls
 lekin iske baad ke match main kuch khaas nahin kar paye hai
 So Sanjay targeted him
 iske baad polard ne teesraa twit kiya, is twit main polard ne apane team kii tarif karte hue likhaa, puri team ne sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya he
 All the players have contributed
 hardik, nitesh, crunal jaise yuva khilaadiyon ne acchhee cricket kheli he
 u finish that sentence
 
 !! All in all great TEAM effort
 
 well done team well done Hardik nitesh krunal youngsters doing the business 👏🏼— Kieron Pollard (@ kieronpollard55) April 9, 2017 rajasthan main mukhyamantri ke naam par purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or congress ke pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat ko lekar lambii kashmakash jari he
 Once again, when a situation like 2008 has arisen in front of the Congress high command in the state, then the party can only trust its wizard who can take everyone along
 darasal saal 2008 main jab congress bahumat ke jaadui aankade se 5 seat dur rah gai thi or mukhyamantri ke taur par tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh seepi joshi kaa naam aage chal rahaa tha, tab bhi ant main party ne gahalot par hi bharosa jataayaa tha
 However, this time the party high command had some difficulty in deciding as Joshi lost by one vote in the 2008 elections
 iske barakes is baar pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat vidhansabha kaa chunaav jite hai
 How to break Rahul's caste hegemony in the politics of right hand politics, if anyone's name comes to the forefront, it is Ashok Gehlot
 soobe ke do baar mukhyamantri rahe gahalot kaa parivaar mali samaaj se aata he
 His family used to perform magic tricks once upon a time
 gujarat ke prabharee ke taur par unhone vahaan kii yuva tikdi hardik-alpesh-jignesh ko congress ke saath khadaakar party ko jeet kii dahalij par laa khadaa kiya
 After this, Gehlot emerged as the right hand of President Rahul Gandhi under the central leadership of the party, General Secretary Gehlot
 indira kii padi najar, sanjay ne dilaai pahachaatshok gahalot ko 70 ke dashak main congress main shaamil hone kaa mauka mila tha, jab purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke samay party main sanjay gandhi kii chalati thi
 When Sanjay Gandhi's close acquaintances told him about Ashok Gehlot, he made Gehlot the president of the party's student organization NSUI in Rajasthan
 gahalot ko shuruaati dinon main sanjay gandhi kii mandali ke log 'gili billy' kahkar sambodhit karte the
 Some believe that Ashok Gehlot was first noticed by Indira Gandhi herself
 jab purvi pakistan (ab bangladesh) main vidroh ke baad purvottar main sharnaarthi sankat khadaa ho gaya tha
 Gehlot was 20 years old at the time, and Indira invited him to join politics
 jiske baad gahalot ne akhil bhartiya congress cameti ke indore sammelan main hissaa liya or yaheen unki mulaakaat sanjay gandhi se hui
 a period of expansion of the Youth Congress, which many strong leaders gave to the Indore Conference of Congress, the late leader Priyaranjan Dasmunsi was elected President of the Youth Congress
 yah wo samay tha jab indira or sanjay gandhi yuva congress ko dakshin panthi jansangh or uske sahyogi sanghathan se mukaable ke liye taiyaar karnaa chaahate the
 Experts believe that this period in the Congress was the golden period of the rise of the youth leadership
 is dauraan party ko kai ahm netaa mili jisamen ashok gahalot , kamalnath, digvijay singh, ambika soni, vylar ravi, eke antni, gulam nabi aaazaad or bike hariprasad shaamil hai
 All these leaders hold great position in today's Congress
 apane swabhaav or saadhaaran prishthbhumi ke anuroop ashok gahalot rajasthan main lo profile rahete hue kaam karte rahe
 But when Rajiv Gandhi got an important role in the party after the death of Sanjay Gandhi in a plane crash, he recommended Gehlot's name as Minister of State in Indira Gandhi's cabinet
 is dauraan rajasthan main congress ke do bade netaa purv mukhyamantri haridev joshi or shivacharan maathur kaa bolbalaa tha
 But Gehlot had the trust of Rajiv Gandhi
 wo ghatana jisane gahalot kaa rasta kiya safaek mashhoor vakya he jab rajasthan bheeshan sookhe se jujh rahaa tha or purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne dilli se 170 kimi dur sariska neshnal park main cabinet kii baithak bulaai thi
 In this meeting, Rajiv had instructed all the ministers of the state to come by their car instead of government vehicles and Rajiv himself was driving a private car
 tabhi ek trephic consteble ne rajeev kii car ko sidhe jane kaa signal dene ke bajaay daahine mudane ke liye kaha
 The result of this mistake by the constable proved costly for Haridev Joshi, because of the diversion, Rajiv reached the place where the ministers' official vehicles were parked
 darasal rajeev iske jariye party or sarkaar main mitvyayita kaa sandesh dena chaah rahe the
 Joshi did not attend the lunch due to Rajiv Gandhi's displeasure, in the absence of host Joshi, his friend and HRD minister PV Narasimha Rao at the Center tried unsuccessfully to cool the case
 or is ghatana ke ek maheene baad haridev joshi ko badalakar shivacharan maathur ko rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri bana diya gaya
 Even though Joshi has returned again after almost two years, after that the Congress high command has not been able to beat him
 centre main bhi chodi amit chhapis dauraan gahalot centre sarkaar main paryaton mantri kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 The credit for the construction of the Delhi Haat just opposite the INA Market in the national capital goes to Gehlot, who worked to deliver the products of artisans, artisans and artisans from all over the country directly to the customers without any middlemen
 rajeev se gahalot kii najdiki ne sonia gandhi or uske baad rahul gandhi kii adhyakshata vaali congress main unki bhoomika kam nahin hone di
 The BJP lost the 1998 assembly elections and Ashok Gehlot was made the Chief Minister after Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 gahalot is samay vidhayak nahin the, lihaaja jodhpur ke sardarpura vidhansabha se vidhayak maansingh devda ne unke liye seat khaali kar di
 After this, Gehlot has been an MLA from this seat continuously since the victory in the by-elections
 jaaton kaa congress se mohabhangajankaron kii maane to mali samudaay se aane vaale ashok gahalot ke mukhyamantri banane par congress ko rajasthan main apane paaramparik jat vot kaa nuksaan hua
 The Jats, who are strongly opposed to the Rajputs, play a crucial role in 60-70 seats in Rajasthan
 rajya main pehle vidhansabha chunaav se hi jaaton kaa jhukaav congress kii taraf rahaa kyonki congress ne rajshahi khatm kii
 Major Jat leaders of the Congress Ramnivas Mirdha, Nathuram Mirdha, Parasaram Maderna had a strong influence in Marwar
 in netaaon ne immergency ke baad bhi jab congress kaa uttar bharat se safaya ho gaya tha tab congress kaa yah kila dhahne nahin diya
 For a long time, the leaders of this community look forward to becoming the Chief Minister for their loyalty
 lekin 1998 main ashok gahalot ke siem banane ke baad inkaa moh bhang hota chalaa gaya
 At present, Gehlot is currently accepted as a mass leader in the politics of Rajasthan, if someone's name is at the top, then he will be Ashok Gehlot
 raajnneetik rup se alpsankhyak or kamjor jati se aane vaale gahalot ne apane kaarykaal main rajasthan main aisa jaadu chalaaya jisaki kaat abhi kisi ke paas nahin he
 Gehlot's political prowess was that in 1998, he reached the pinnacle of power, leaving behind Parasram Maderna, a strong contender for the chief minister
 bhale hi rajasthan main mritpraaya padi party main jaan foonkane main payalat safal rahe hon lekin rajasthan kii janata ke saamne abhi unhen khud ko sabit karnaa baaki he
 Gehlot is a common leader among the backward castes of the state
 ashok gahalot jis samudaay kaa netritv karte hai wo shant mana jaataa he or pichhadi jatiyaan unke netritv main khud ko surakshit mahasoos karti hai
 This is the reason that keeping in mind all aspects, Congress President Rahul Gandhi finally chose Gehlot instead of Pilot

 Easter Day 2019: Easter is one of the important festivals of Christianity
 isa messiah ke punerjeevit hone kii khushi main easter parv manaaya jaataa he
 According to the beliefs of Christianity, Jesus was resurrected on the third day of Good Friday, which is celebrated by the people of Christianity as Easter Sunday
 easter ko mritotthana diwas yaa mritotthana ravivaar bhi kehete hai
 Apart from Christmas, Easter is the biggest festival of Christianity

 kyon manaaya jaataa he easter parv?isai dharm kii manyataon ke anusaar, hajaaron saal pehle good friday ke din isah messiah ko jerusalem kii pahadiyon par suuli par chadhaaya gaya tha
 After this, on the third day of Good Fried, ie on the first Sunday, Jesus Christ was resurrected
 mana jaataa he ki punarjanm ke baad isa messiah kareeb 40 din tak apane shishyon ke saath rahe the
 After this he went to heaven forever
 isliye easter parv kaa jashn puure 40 din tak manaaya jaataa he
 But officially the Easter feast lasts 50 days
 is parv ko isai dharm ke log badi dhooma-dham or utsaah se manaate hai
 How is Easter celebrated? - The first week of Easter feast is called Easter week

 Importance of eggs on Easter - Eggs have special significance on Easter feast
 isai dharm ke log easter parv par andey sajaakar ek duusare ko gift karte hai
 They believe that eggs convey the start of good days and new life
 darasal, isai dharm ke logon kaa maananaa he ki andey main se jis tarah ek nayaa jivan utpann hota he, vah logon ko nai shuruyaat kaa sandesh detaa he
 On the call of Youth for Equality (YFE), all the capitals of the state, in the major cities of the country, on April 14 between 6 and 7 pm, lit candles at all these places (about 500 cities), the first of their kind in the entire country

 tathaa samvidhan nirmaataa biaar ambedkar kii 128veen jayanti par youth for equility samooche desh main jati hataane ke liye shantipurna march karke unhen shradhanjali arpit karegi
 Youth for Equality National President Dr
 Kaushal Kant Mishra while talking to NDTV said that the organization, which has been working continuously since 2006 for social harmony through opposition to caste policies, now has the message of removing caste from all over the country on the birth anniversary of Constituent Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Will give
 unhone saamaajik andolan kaa hissaa banane ke liye aavan kiya he
 They believe that all political parties are dividing the society in the name of caste, whereas after 70 years of independence, caste untouchability has been legally abolished in the country, by forming political parties in the name of castes and caste It is being kept alive by making government policies which have become a weapon of power for only 5 years
 yahi vajah he ki YFE samvidhan kii raksha va bharat ke bhavishya ko bachaane ke liye ek kanoon kii maang karti he jo sabhi sarkari dastavejon se jati ko khatm karke sabhi nagarikon ko samaan avasar pradaan kare
 There seems to be a contest between the BJP and Congress in the Gujarat assembly elections
 bijepi chhathi baar jeet kaa paracham lahraane ke liye maidan main he, to vahiin congress do dashak se jari satta ke vanvaas ko todane kii jaddojahad kar rahi he
 In the second phase, voting will be held in 93 seats in 14 districts
 is daur ke matdaan main madhya gujarat or uttar gujarat ke ilaake shaamil hai
 This phase is very difficult for both Congress and BJP and both parties are surrounded by challenges
 yahi vajah he ki donon kii gujarat main jeet kii raah kaanton bhari najar aa rahi he
 Challenged, the Congress may have been out of power in Gujarat for two decades, but its hold on rural seats of North Gujarat and Central Gujarat has always been strong
 duusare daur kii 93 siton main se 54 siten gramin kshetra kii hai
 In the last assembly election, the Congress had achieved much better results in the rural areas of these two areas, but this time the changed equation has created many difficulties
 baagi bane museebatcongress ke saamne duusare daur main sabase bada sirdard baagi bane hue hai
 Its 16 rebels are in the fray against the Congress in North Gujarat
 isse congress kaa sameekaran bigadataa hua najar aa rahaa he
 The biggest challenge is in Banaskantha district, where the Congress is facing rebels in five of the nine seats
 baagiyon ke utarane se congress ko kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Patel is not united, in the second round there are also Patel majority seats
 congress hardik patel ko sadhakar bijepi ke paramparaagat voton main sendhamari karne kii jugat kar rahi thi, lekin patel ekajute hokar congress ke paksh main khadaa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 This has upset the equation of Congress victory
 patelon kii nazdikiyon se obisi kii durigujrat main patel or obisi ek duusare ke virdohi he
 These days the Congress' love for the Patels is very strong, this attitude of the party can distance the obcs
 congress ne alpesh thakor ko party main shaamil kiya he, lekin wo bhi bada karishma dikhaate najar nahin aa rahe hai
 The Congress has lost ground in alliance with JDU rebel leader Chhotubhai Vasava in Gujarat
 congress ne vasava kii party bhartiya tribal party ko saat siten di hai
 In this way, the seat coming to the account of Congress can now go to Vasava's party
 gathbandhan karne main congress ke kai raajnneetik sameekaran bighad gaye hai
 In Adivasis, the Congress has the highest hold among tribals in the game
 congress ne pichley chunaav main adivaasiyon kii 27 surakshit siton main se congress ne 16 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 But in the last two years, BJP has made inroads among tribals through RSS
 adivasee bacchon ko behatar shiksha ke liye sangh ke log skool, awaas, uniform or bhojan uplabdh karaate hai
 These are the difficulties of the BJP, BJP has been in the limelight in Gujarat politics for two decades
 bijepi lagaataar paanch vidhansabha chunaav jitati aa rahi he, lekin chhathi baar uski jeet kii raah main kaaphi mushkilen khadi ho gai hai
 The challenge of saving urban seats: The second round has 39 urban seats
 in siton par bijepi kaa dabadabaa he
 In the last election, BJP won most of the seats of Ahmedabad and Vadodara
 lekin is baar notebandi or jiesti ke chalate vyapaariyon main naaraazgi badi he
 In such a situation, it is a challenge for the BJP to save these seats
 bijepi kaa bigadaa jaateey samikarancongress is baar jaateey sameekaran set karke maidan main utari he, jo bijepi ke liye musiibat kaa sabab bana hua he
 Congress has formed a combination of Muslims including obcs, Dalits and Patidars
 bijepi congress kii kaat talash nahin paa rahi he
 The Congress's caste equation remains a challenge for the BJP
 patidaaron kii naarazgipatidaar samaaj bijepi kaa paramparaagat votbank mana jaataa he, lekin 2015 main patel aarakshan andolan ke chalate unamem bijepi se naaraazgi badi he
 In the second round, there was a Patidar movement in the same areas where polling is to be held
 patidaar netaa hardik patel lagaataar bijepi ke khilaaf maahaul banane main lage hai
 In such a situation, this crisis remains for the BJP
 daliton ke jakhm abhi bhare nahingujarat main bijepi ke liye dalit matadaataaon ko sadhana mushkil ho rahaa he
 These are traditional voters of BJP
 pichley chunaav main bijepi 13 surakshit siton main se 10 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi, lekin dalit netaa jignesh mewaani kaa congress ke paksh main samarthan karnaa, bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he

 Gavaskar also believes that the Delhi cricketer can fill the spirit and energy like Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi in the team when he becomes captain but he complained that the way Kohli behaves after scoring a century or achieving an achievement, he should do not like it
 sharma ne haalanki kaha ki ab kohli paripakv ho gaya he or aage aisa vyavhaar nahin karegaa
 He said, 'I have explained it to him
 main vishwaas dilaataa hum ki vah aage se aisa nahin karegaa
 He was still quite young and used to get excited very quickly, but now he has matured and in the new year you will see a completely changed Kohli
 ’unhone kaha, ‘kohli ko captain banane kaa faisla chayankartaaon ko karnaa he
 i understand that now he is ready for this responsibility but i have advised him not to think too much about captaincy and only focus on scoring runs
 ’varsh 2012 main jab bharat ke diggaj ballebaaj desh or videsh main ran banane ke liye jujhate rahe tab kohli ne teenon praaroop main sarvaadhik ran banaakar khud ko behatar ballebaaj sabit kiya
 He scored 49 in nine Tests
 21 kii ausat or teen shatakon kii madad se 689 ran banaaye
 Kohli made 68 in only 17 odis in 2012
 40 kii ausat se 1026 ran banaae jisamen paanch shatak shaamil hai
 Last year, only Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara (1184) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (1119) scored more runs than them, but they both played 14 matches more than Kohli
 sharma ko vishwaas he ki kohli kii yah farm 2013 main bhi barkaraar rahegi
 He said, 'the past year has been very good for him and i want him to continue to do well in the future
 mujhe vishwaas he ki 2013 main vah behatar parinaam degaa
 Kohli performed brilliantly in T20 as well in T20s like Tests and odis
 unhone 14 match kii 13 pariyon main 39
 471 runs at an average of 25
 vah mahaj ek ran se sarvaadhik ran banane vaale kiwi ballebaaj martin guptil kii barabari karne se chook gayi

 badminton jaise khel main ek kuch saal pehle tak bharat ke paas koi bhi naam aisa nahin tha, jo olympics main medal kaa daawa thok sake, lekin 'super cyna' ne is sookhe ko khatm kar pehali baar is khel main desh ke liye padak kii ummid jagaai he
 
 
 Saina Nehwal has come in her best form at the right time
 
 
 olympics main kareeb ek maheene kaa vakt bachaa he or cyna kii taiyaariyaan puure ufaan par hai
 
 
 She has shown two big titles in her name within a week that she is not going to miss this time
 
 
 form, fitness or aankade, har lihaaz se cyna kaa daawa majboot nazar aa rahaa he
 
 
 Saina, who was struggling with poor form in the year 2011, has made a strong comeback this year and has made three big tournaments so far
 
 
 'super cyna' ne saal kii shuruyaat main swiss open jeeta, is maheene kii shuruyaat main thailand open kaa khitaab, or ab indonesia open par phir qabza karke apni shandaar form kaa saboot de diya he
 
 
 After winning the Indonesia Open for the third time, Saina's coach and former player Pullela Gopichand also believed that this win will give him a boost before the Olympics
 
 
 cyna khud jeetne kaa baad behad utsahit ho gayi or kaha ki yah kaaphi kadaa muqaabala tha, mujhe yahaan ke darshak pasand hai, yahaan aakar khelnaa acha lagata he, main jab bhi court par utarati hum, champion jaisaa mahasoos karti hum
 
 
 However, Saina has not forgotten her goal in the joy of victory, and now she will spend five weeks of hard training for the Olympics
 
 
 kul milakar cyna ke paas yah sunaharaa mauka he, apni is form kaa phayda uthaakar desh ke liye olympics main medal laane kaa
 
 
 Saina also participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but lost in the quarter-finals at the time
 
 
 tippaniyan So, if she wins at the London Olympics this year, it will be the first Olympic medal for India in badminton, and Saina will become the second woman from India to win an Olympic medal
 
 
 vaise vishwa main paanchavin variyata praapt cyna ne sahi vakt par raftaar pakadi he, lekin landan olympics main unke saamne chunauti aasaan nahin hogi
 
 
 The Chinese players known as the 'great Wall of China' will obstruct every step in their path, but those who know Saina also know very well that this will not make Saina's steps waver, and will strengthen
 
 
 cyna nehwal sahi vakt par apni behtareen form main ai hai
 
 
 There is about a month left in the Olympics and Saina's preparations are in full swing
 
 
 usne ek hafte ke andar hi do bade kitaab apane naam kar dikhaa diya he ki is baar vah chukne vaali nahin
 
 
 In terms of form, fitness and statistics, Saina's claim looks strong
 
 
 varsh 2011 main kharaab form se jujh rahi cyna ne is saal joardaar vaapasi karte hue abhi tak teen bade toornament apane naam kar liye hai
 
 
 'super Saina' won the Swiss Open at the beginning of the year, the title of Thailand Open earlier this month, and has now given proof of its form by retaking Indonesia Open
 
 
 indonesia open teesri baar jeetne ke baad cyna ke coach or purv khilaadi pulela gopichand ne bhi mana ki olympics se pehle yah jeet uskaa hausala badhayegi
 
 
 Saina became very excited after winning herself and said that it was a tough competition, i like the audience here, i love to come and play here, i feel like a champion every time i get on the court
 
 
 haalanki cyna jeet kii khushi main apana lakshya nahin bhuuli hai, or ab vah olympics ke liye paanch hafte kii kadi training karengi
 
 
 Overall, Saina has this golden opportunity, taking advantage of this form to bring the medal to the Olympics for the country
 
 
 cyna ne varsh 2008 ke beijing olympics main bhi hissaa liya tha, lekin us vakt vah quarter final main haar gai thim
 
 
 The comments so, is saal landan olympics main agar vah jeet jaati hai to vah badminton main bharat ke liye yah pehla olympics medal hoga, or kul milakar cyna bharat kii ore se olympics main medal jeetne vaali duusari mahila banengi
 
 
 Though fifth seed Saina has picked the pace at the right time, but the challenge will not be easy for her in the London Olympics
 
 
 'great wal of china' ke naam se mashhoor chini khilaadi unki raah main har kadam par roda daalengi, lekin cyna ko jaanane vaale yah bhi bahut acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki isse cyna ke kadam dagamagaayenge nahin, or majboot honge

 The company has allowed employees to bring their devices to office despite concerns about data security
 company ne kai aise ap viksit kiye hai, jise karmchaaree istemaal kar sakate hai
 This kind of initiative has strengthened the relationship with employees, which is also reflected in the attrition rate at TCS

 The attrition rate of 9 percent is the lowest in the industry
 infosis main (uski sahaayak companiyon ko chhodkar) yah rate 17 fisadi he
 TCS is also able to retain its top executives, many such officers have been associated with the company since the nineties

 This would be called a bold move in a fairly traditional-minded country, which gave the company a good opportunity to do its branding

 " In the house of Burari where the bodies of 11 people have been found, now two registers have also been reported to be recovered
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki in registers main sabhi mauton kaa din, vakt or tarika tak likhaa hua tha
 Actually till yesterday, Delhi Police, entangled in the puzzle of eleven corpses of Burari, is now stuck in the pages of two registers
 ye register ghar ke ek chote mandir ke paas mili hai
 The manner of death, day of death and time of death are clearly written on the pages of the register
 hairatnaak ye he ki parivaar ne apni jaan hoobahoo vaise hi di he jaisi register main likhi he
 Register of Death! 1
 register main likhaa he ki sabhi log ankhon par pattiyaan achche se baandhenge
 The bandage is tied so that only zero is seen

 Shockingly, Burari's family chose death in exactly the same manner as was already recorded in the register
 register main likhaa tha ki koun kahaan latakegaa or thik aisa hi kiya bhi gaya
 According to police sources, the head of the family, Narayani Devi, was found lying in a separate room

 The first entry in the register is of November 2017 while the last entry is on 25 June
 register main likhaa tha- sabhi ichchhaaon kii purti ho
 The way things are written on the pages of the register, it seems that either this whole action was done to fulfill any desire, or the reason behind giving collective life is the desire for salvation
 register main bhi aisa kuch likhaa hone kii baat bataai ja rahi he
 The police is now engaged in decoding each page of the register and everything written in it
 kai ahm sawaal police kii padtaal ke centre main hai
 Like who wrote what has been written in the register, is it really written the script of the death of the family in the register, is there a mechanism behind this death, and is there any way to confuse the police

 house of ripregentative se trump ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav pasjaane kya hota he mahabhiyog prastaav, kya hoti he isaki prakriyamerica raashtrapati donald trump ke khilaaf house of ripregentative yani nichle sadan main mahabhiyog prastaav paas ho gaya he
 Trump's troubles have increased after being near it
 aaie pehle vistaar se jaanate hai aakhir kya he mahabhiyog prastaav (impeachment) or kyon bad rahi hai trump kii mushkilen
 First of all, let us tell you that after the Ukraine dispute over Donald Trump, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Polosi had talked of bringing impeachment alleging misuse of the post
 jiske baad guuruuvaar ko 6 ghante tak charchaa ke baad jab matdaan hua to do artical ke tahat mahabhiyog prastaav house of ripregentative se paas kar diya gaya
 After which it is clear that the process of impeachment will now be started against Trump
 iskaa asar unke pad, kursi, sarkaar par kya padegaa, iske bare main aage jaanate hai
 How will the process of impeachment process The process of impeachment is considered quite complicated
 america ke raashtrapati donald trump par mahabhiyog chalaane ke liye ek lambii sanvaidhanik prakriya ko puraa karnaa padaa
 In such cases the entire process goes like this
 - america samvidhan ke anusaar kisi raashtrapati ko uske 4 saal kaa kaarykaal purna hone se pehle mahabhiyog ke jariye hataaya ja saktaa he
 - There are several grounds for removing the President of America from his office
 samvidhan ke anusaar agar raashtrapati rajdroh karne, rishwat lene, ucch aparaadh or kadachaar main lipt hone kaa doshi paaya jaataa he unhen raashtrapati pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 - What crimes can come under the purview of high crime and malpractice
 iske faisla congress ke vivek par choda jaataa he
 - Corruption, misconduct and obstruction of judicial proceedings are also involved in high crime
 - raashtrapati ko uske pad se hataane ke liye house of riprogentative ek jeuri kii tarah do tihaai bahumat se mahabhiyog kaa prastaav paas kar sakati he
 - The Senate has the right to remove the President from his post as a court after the motion of impeachment is passed
 kisi hoti america kii sansalmerica kaa cese len to mahabhiyog kii shuruyaat hoti he house of ripregentative se
 It has different processes in every country
 mahabhiyog kii prakriya ko samajhane ke liye america sansad kii banaavat ko samajhnaa mahavatpurna he
 Like our Parliament, the United Congress has two parts
 seenet yani upree sadan or house of ripregentative yani nichalaa sadan
 The Senate consists of 100 senators
 sanyukt raaj praant main kul 50 praant he or har praant par do seenetters hote hai
 The House of Representatives has a total of 435 elected members
 chah non voting sadsy atirikt hote hai
 The role of both these houses is important in the process of impeachment
 spikar nancy ne kya kahahouse of ripregentative kii spikar nancy ne kaha ki samvidhan ke dwaara jo house of ripregentative ko mahabhiyog kii takat di gai he, unhone sabhi democrates sadasyon ko sambodhit karte hue likhaa ki hamane bataur congress sadsy is baat kii shapath lee thi ki ham samvidhan kii raksha karenge, jiskaa ab samay aa gaya he
 What are the charges: Donald Trump is accused of illegally seeking help from Ukraine to tarnish the image of potential rivals in the 2020 US presidential election and other rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden
 iske alaava trump par sansad ke kaam main baadha daalane kaa bhi aarope he
 How many US presidents have been removed so far in the history of American Parliament, no President has been removed by impeachment
 house of riprogentative ne ab tak teen raashtrapatiyon ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav paas kiya he
 The impeachment motion from the lower house has passed against Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998 and Donald Trump in 2019
 johnson or clinton donon seenet se batch gaye the
 Trump's case will now go to the Senate
 iske alaava 1974 main richard nicksan ke khilaaf house judishari cameti ne mahabhiyog kii prakriya shuru kii thi

 # mannkibaat— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)december 27, 2015modi ne yuvaaon ko apane vichaar 'narendra modi mobile ap' par bhejne kaa aagrah kiya

 vaise kai exparts kii nazar main viraat kohli team india ke sabase talented khilaadi hai
 But some other players have shown similar attitude before them
 team−india ke 'engri yangamen' pehle bhi kaamyaab rahe hai or aane vaale world cap main bhi akraman kii ummid he
 Virat Kohli's attitude has become a trade mark of Indian cricket
 yuvaraj singh jaise khilaadi kohli ke is tevar ke kaayal hai or ise khule taur par maanane se inkaar nahin karte
 But if the attitude of Team India has changed in the last fifteen years, then the credit of shifting the team to this color goes to Sourav Ganguly
 captain ganguli khud bhi kai dafaa apane tevar se vipakshi team par hamale bolte rahe or apni team ko vipakshi khilaadiyon kii ankhon main ankhen daalkar jawaab dene ko kehete rahe
 Therefore, in the last decade and a half, Team India held many such matches when the team seemed to be moving towards defeat
 yuvaraj jis aakraamakata kaa zikr kohli ke liye karte hai, vah aakraamakata vah khud bhi kai baar dikhaa chuke hai
 Whether it was the final of the natwest Series or the feat of six sixes to Stuart Broad in the World T20, Yuvraj won the match with his style and also the heart of the fans
 saurav ganguli ke jamaaye gaye hunar ko maujuuda captain mahendra singh dhoni ne team india kii aadat main badal daali
 This is the reason that now not one but many players of the team play the role of angry young man on occasions
 in dinon suresh raina kai baar team india ke liye baar apane aakraamak ravaiye ke sahare team india kii naiya paar lagaate dikhe hai
 All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has also proved to be captain Dhoni's special weapon at times
 isi saal july maheene main lards test ke dauraan ravindra jadeja kii 68 ran kii ahm pari isi tevar kaa ek or saboot thi
 And then who can forget their way of rotating the bat like a Nanchaku after a fifties innings
 dressing room main captain dhoni bhi isse prabhavit hue bina nahin rah sake
 Captain Dhoni himself is also known for this attitude
 mushkil halaat main lakshya kaa peechha karte hue dhoni ne apni tabadatod ballebaazi se kai baar match kaa rukh badla he
 In fact, Team India has touched many times by playing like Angry Youngman
 agar 2015 world cap tak team india ke is tevar kii dhar kam nahin padi, to fans agle world cap main bhi team ko sar ankhon par bitha lenge
