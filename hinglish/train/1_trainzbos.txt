 During the meeting with US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, the announcement of trade deal with America was postponed for some time
 ab isi mudde par congress ne piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he or unhen ‘campaner-in-chif’ qaraar diya he
 The Congress party made two tweets on the trade deal issue

 This could have been a good step for our economy, getting India the status of trade partner could have boosted the enthusiasm of investors

 Samajwadi Party mlas will no longer attend the meeting called by Mulayam
 aaj yani mangalvaar ko vidhanmandal dal kii baithak main unhen bataaya gaya ki ve akhilesh ke alaava kisi or kii bulaai meeting main nahin ja sakate
 The shocking thing was that Shivpal was not invited to the meeting
 naaraaz aazam khan bhi akhilesh kii baithak main shaamil nahin hue
 On the other hand, Mulayam too had called a meeting to give a party to the mlas, but canceled the meeting as soon as this thing was realized
 yun to samaajawaadee party ke janmdata mulaayam singh yadav hi hai or party ke 90 fisadi se zyaada netaa unheen ke banaae hue hai lekin mulaayam ko dubaara adhyaksh banane ke mudde par ab unke qareebi bhi bolne se kanni katate hai
 The legislature party met at the Samajwadi Party office in which all the mlas and mlcs attended
 unhen bataaya gaya ki akhilesh ke alaava kisi or ke meeting bulaane par ve na jaaen kyonki vidhanmandal dal kaa netaa hi unki baithak bula saktaa he
 Perhaps Mulayam was aware of this, so he canceled the meeting of mlas and the dinner party called at his house on Wednesday
 tippaniyan Samajwadi Party, an MLC Bakkal Nawab says, "it is as if it was not a meeting
" kal vaali jo baithak thi
 She was not there
 haa, bilkul nahin thi or wo aise hi kah diya gaya tha
 It is not a meeting place
 purv mantri balavant singh ramuvaalia se jab poocha gaya ki kya bhavishya main netaji ko pad waapas karenge? to ve bole - main kuch nahin kah rahaa
 I'm not saying anything

 Which is less 10 quintal weight

 There is a discussion that he is angry at not being made the leader of the party in the assembly but Shivpal Yadav was not called
 aisa unke qareebi kehete hai
 Party leader Ram Gobind Chaudhary was asked when Shivpal Yadav did not attend the meeting today
 
 Are they angry yet? Now this is it

 Azam Khan did not reach the meeting
 charchaa he ki vidhansabha main party kaa netaa na banaae jane se naaraaz hai lekin shivpal yadav ko bulaayaa nahin gaya
 His close says this
 vidhansabha main party ke netaa ramgovind choudhary se jab poocha gaya ki aaj shivpal yadav baithak main nahin shaamil hue
 
 kya wo abhi tak naaraaz hai? ab yah to
 
 
 
 aap sabhi log humari mitra hai, hamaare upar krupa bani rahani chahie or sakaaratmak prashn hone chahie
 Politicians say that the family's quarrel also has a big role in this bad defeat of the party and if it continues further, it will not be an auspicious sign for the party
 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki kisi vyakti ko ubaasi letaa dekhakar aapako bhi ubaasi kyon aane lagati he? ubaasi lene kii samyavadhi kya hoti he yaa phir insaan kis umr se ubaasi lenaa shuru kar detaa he?yun to ubaasi ekasaamanya shaareerik prakriyaahai lekin isse judi kai choti-badi baton par ham dhyaan nahin dete hai
 Although doctors do not consider Ubasi to be contagious, it spreads very rapidly from one person to another and second to third person in a similar manner
 ubaasi ko lekar hamaare samaaj main bahut sari galatchhemiyaan hai
 For example, is it associated with sleep or boredom? Whereas research conducted by scientists at Princeton University has shown that boredom is not a sign of sleepiness or boredom but rather it keeps the temperature of the brain under control
 hamaare sharir kii banaavat or kaarividhi kuch is tarah vyavasthit he ki nahin chaahate hue bhi ubaasi kii sthiti main ekaek munh khul jaataa he
 With this, the brain not only gets cold, but also the muscles of the face are stretched
 american academy of sleep medicine main prakashit research ke mutabik ubaasi se sharir main oxigen kii kami kii bharpai bhi hoti he
 In fact, when the lungs do not get enough oxygen to pump, it replenishes oxygen by mouth
 dimag apane walls ko thanda rakhane ke liye ubaasi letaa he
 In a research conducted in the year 2004, it was revealed that 50 percent of the people look at the front and get bored
 2012 main kiye gaye research ke mutabik anuvanshik or bhaavnaatmak rup se jude logon ko ubaasi lete dekhakar adhik ubaasi aati he
 It is clear that along with humans, many other species including animals also suffer
 lekin kya aapako pataa he ki ek bhrun maa ke garbh main 11wein hafte se hi ubaasi lenaa shuru kar detaa he
 Generally, the duration of Ubasi is six seconds
 lekin yah kabhi kabhaar isse thodi adhik bhi ho jaati he
 Humans average an average of 240,000 times a lifetime
 america ke neshnal institute of health ke shodharthiyon ne research main pataa lagaaya he ki insaan main atyadhik ubaasi bhi kaaphi kuch bayaan karti he
 For example, if you are getting bored in a short period of time, then it is a sign of insomnia, which leads to many types of diseases later
 ubaasi ko rokane par bhi sharir par iskaa dushprabhav padataa he
 Therefore, doctors also say that it should not be stopped when it comes to boredom

 input language mohammad hanif golda khaane ke paas note exange karaane waalon kii line ke said main khadey ek stall par kuch badbada rahe hai, pataa karne se maaloom hua ki mohammad hanif nayaa khaataa khulwaane kii jaddojahad main jute hai, wo bhi apane bete kaa
 Till a week ago, the son had no plan to open an account in the post office, but now he is filling the line for a new account by putting in the line, he says on asking, Modi ji has announced, but what happened to the common man
 She knows this
 har bank main line he,note badalawaneor paise nikalwane kii to soch bhi nahin sakate, kyonki har bank main bheed he
 In such a situation, opening a new account and depositing money in it seems easier
 bainkon or dakgharon ne nayaa khaataa khulwaane waalon ke liye alag se counter lagaaya he, yahaan bheed bhi kam he, line main zyada der lagane kii pareshaani bhi nahin he or jaldi se khaataa khul bhi rahaa he
 So, by opening an account in the name of the son, we will now deposit money in it
 mohammad hanif akele aise shaks nahin he, jinhone apane paise cobankmen jamaa karne kaa aasaan tarika apanaaya he
 Like him, Sanjay was also seen filling the form at the post office counter to open a new account
 sanjay ke mutabik abhi bhi unke paas duusare bank main khaataa he, lekin jab wo gol daakkhaana par paise badalawaane pahunche, to pataa chalaa ki line kaaphi lambii he, lekin saath hi maaloom hua ki nayaa khaataa khulwaanaa ho to alag se counter laga hua he or yahaan zyada bheed bhi nahin he
 You can also deposit a lot of money at the same time and can also withdraw money worth of expenses
 bas sanjay ko baat jam gai or turant hi nayaa khaataa khulwaane kaa faisla kar liya
 The story of Hanif and Sanjay is of a lot of people, who these days are in the same gripe about how the notes kept in the house can be changed or deposited in the bank, but the trouble starts when the bank Reach in front of, where long long lines are attached
 bainko auradakgharone bhi is maukey ko apane graahak banane kaa sunaharaa avasar bana liya he
 Earlier people had to make vows to open a new account, but now people are reaching out to them to open an account
 logon ko suvidha mil rahi he or bainkon ko nae graahak
 The problem of the note will end in a few months, but the account opened under compulsion will continue till later

 Direct changes mean progress that has been made in China after reforms by Deng Xiaoping (1978–84), in the US through Ronald Reagan (1981–89), in Britain through Margaret Thatcher (1979–90), and in 1991–1995

 The history of economic reforms that created turmoil brings two major conclusions
 pehla—zyaadaatar safal sudhaaron ne antat nagarikon ko aazaadee or takat bakshi he or nayaa madhya varg taiyaar kiya
 Reagan's reforms focused on reducing government control, halting inflation and increasing private entrepreneurship
 iskaa nateeja assi ke dashak kii tej growth, nae rojgaron or tej khapat main najar aayaa
 Thatcher's package in erstwhile Britain, divided between the Labor Union and the affluent, was also based on free markets, privatization of government companies, control over inflation and limiting government, creating a new middle class that supported Thatcher in Britain
 china main deng shyaoping ke sudhaar vishaal aabaadi kii aay badhaane ke makasad se shuru hue
 These reforms made China the unmatched economic power of the world and made 70 million people out of poverty and made it the largest middle class in the world
 doosraa—zyaadaatar sudhaar aarthik or saamaajik jaruraton kii dein the jinke rajnatik laabh baad main najar aae
 Demonetisation is the biggest economic upheaval in post-independence India, reaching its final stage as per the limits set by the Prime Minister
 iske taatkaalik nateezon main raahat kam or chubhan zyada he
 This reform has limited the economic freedom of the common people
 modi ke satta main aane se pehle ek madhya varg taiyaar ho chukaa tha jo rojgaar, aay, kharch or khapat main badhotaree ko lekar baichaiyn he
 He is enthralled by the Robin Hood model of this reform (punishment to the rich, relief to the poor) but swings between apprehension and intangible expectations with increasing pain

 The political goals of this reform are visible, the picture of direct economic benefits is yet to be drawn

 film kaa naam:masanadiarector:niraj ghevnster cast:richa chaddha, viki kaushal 
 Shweta Tripathi, Sanjay Mishra, Saurabh Chaudhary Duration: 109 minutes Certificates: a Rating: 3
 5 starkai film samarohon main dhooma machaane ke baad aakhirkaar film 'masaan' cinemagharon main relies hone ko taiyaar he
 The events that took place over time are depicted through this film
 ab kya yah film aapako dekhne ke liye vivash karegi yaa nahin aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 Story: This film depicts two different stories on the banks of the Ganges in the city of Banaras
 ek taraf devi pathak (richa chaddha) apane kareebi dost kii mrityu ke jurm main fas jaati hai or unhen isse ubaarane ke liye pita vidyadhar pathak (sanjay mishra) har kadam saath dene ko taiyaar rahete hai vahin duusari taraf doctor choudhary (vineet kumaar) ko shaalu gupta (shweta treepathi) se pyaar he lekin us pyaar main bhi kai rukaawatein hai
 Now these two stories proceed with each other and finally the director concludes the film with an optimistic conclusion
 script, abhinay, sangitafilm kii script or screenple kaaphi dischasp he jisaki vajah se regular relies main is film ko dekhnaa aavashyak he
 Although the film is only 109 minutes, but in such a period of time, it tells many truths of life
 ek pita jo apni beti ke ujjwal bhavishya ke liye kisi bhi had tak jaataa he vahiin ek madhyam varg kaa ladkaa ek ucch varg kii ladki se pyaar bhi karata he
 The director has also shown the events happening near the city of Banaras and the Ganges coast very easily
 sanjay mishra or richa chaddha ke kuch aise seen hai jo jarur aapako sochane par vivash kar dete hai
 At the same time, due to some scenes, your eyes will become moist, while some will try to laugh a scene
 abhinay main ek baar phir se richa chaddha ne sabit kar diya he kii wo ek behtareen adaakara he, harek seen main wo khud ko behatar sabit karti hai
 Sanjay Mishra has done a great job as a father
 inke alaava shweta treepathi or vineet kumaar kaa bhi act kaabil-e-tarif he
 Though Pankaj Tripathi does not have a big role but at one time he too gets laughed at
 is film se debyue karne vaale viki kaushal kii acting bhi kaaphi aashajanak he
 The music of the film, especially the song 'man Kasturi Re' and the tune playing in the background, coincides with the beauty of the occasion
 kyon dekhegar aapako film samaaroh kii sanjeeda filmein kaaphi pasand hai or jivan kii aapa- dhapi ko agar aap or kareeb se niharna chaahate hai to yah film aap jarur dekhen
 Why not see if you are only in commercial or flirtatious movies etc
, then do not watch
 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke sarkari awaas 10, circular road par unki suraksha waapas behaal hone ke baad bhi unka parivaar suraksha lene se inkaar kar rahaa he
 Both his sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap Yadav, including former Chief Minister Rabri Devi, sent back the security restored by the Nitish Kumar government from their residence
 gauratlab he do-teen din pehle police mukhyalay ne lalu prasad ko pradaan kii gaisuraksha ko waapas le liya tha
 Since then, the Lalu family was very angry and returned their security in protest
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne is puure maamle kaa sangyaan lete hue lalu ke ghar par suraksha waapas behaal kar di, lekin rabari devi kaa kahana he ki vah yah suraksha waapas nahin lengi jab tak mukhyamantri unhen yah nahin bataate hai ki kiske kehane par lalu kii suraksha kii kami kii gai thi?suraksha ko lekar uthe vivaad ke bich shuukravaar korabari deviapane donon beton ke saath nijee gaadi main apane ghar se vidhansabha pahunche, jahaan par unhone aagaamee 23 april ko hone vaale vidhaan parishad chunaav ke liye apana parichay bharaa
 During this time, no security personnel of Rabri, Tejashwi and Tej Pratap were with them
 yah baat to saafe he ki lalu parivaar ne suraksha lene se inkaar kar diya he
 But the government is not willing to take any risk and that is why it is constantly following the Lalu family like a shadow
 lalu ke parivaar ke sadsy jahaan kahin bhi ja rahe hai or unhen suraksha dene kii puri koshish kii ja rahi he
 Rabri Devi arrived in the Legislative Council on Friday to fill her papers with her sons, while all the security personnel were keeping an eye on the family from a distance of a hundred meters
 'ajtak' se baatcheet karte hue tejasvi yadav ke suraksha main tainaat surakshakarmi ne kaha ki police vibhaag se nirdesh mila he ki bhale hi lalu parivaar suraksha lene se manaa kare lekin unke chaaron taraf hameshaa suraksha kaa gheraa hona chahie
 It is perhaps for the first time in politics that the big politicians of the country are refusing to take the security provided to them and the government is trying to keep them safe by chasing them

 He asked the question that why the state government has proved to be a complete failure on the issue of education, health, irrigation, public distribution system, women empowerment, security among the claims of development? Why is the system in disarray? There is no system for this in the 'seven Definitions'
 tippaniyan The MP said, "the government is going through a period of uncertainty on every front
 apane anishchay or antarvirodh main sarkaar ulajh kar rah jaaegi or janata badahaal hoti rahegi
 "welcoming the central government's decision to ban 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, he said the government's move is bold and the Jan Adhikar Party welcomes it
 isse aantki gatividhiyon par roak lagane main madad mil sakati he, lekin kisi bade badlaav kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati he

 He said that 'seven-point' is a hoax with the public and misuse of government resources
 unhone sawalia lahaze main kaha ki vikaas ke daavon ke bich aakhir shiksha, swasthya, sinchai, saarvajanik vitaran pranali, mahila shashaktikaran, suraksha ke mudde par rajya sarkaar puri tarah vifal kyon sabit ho rahi he? vyavastha badahaal kyon ho gai he? iske liye 'saat nishchay' main koi vyavastha nahin he
 The comments saansad ne kaha, "sarkaar har morche par anishchay ke daur se guzar rahi he
 The government will remain entangled in its indecision and contradiction and the public will continue to be in disarray
 " centre sarkaar dwaara 500 or 1,000 rupee ke note par pratibandh lagaae jane ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa yah kadam saahasik he or jan adhikaar party iskaa swaagat karti he

 com / ucnnck19kp How can we call it tradition which spreads panic in the place of happiness, which tradition spreads hatred instead of beauty
 karnataka main ek aisi parampara he jo bacchon kii jaan se kheltaa he
 In Bijapur, Karnataka, in the name of tradition, a milk baby is thrown down from a height of about 16 to 20 feet
 dar ke maare bachche rote bilakhte hai par yahaan andhvishwaas kaa aisa shor rahata he ki bacchon ke rone kii aavaz dab jaati he
 Surprisingly, all this happens at the will of the parents
 bijapur ke shri santheshwar mandir main ye parampara saalon se chali aa rahi he
 It is believed that this temple of the 14th century fulfills every wish
 bachche kii mannath maangane vaale mata pita muraad puri hone par is parampara kaa paakhand nibhaate hai
 It is believed that the child remains healthy and prosperous throughout his life
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki isamen jokhim jaanate hue bhi prashasan ne kabhi isapar roak lagane kii koshish nahin kii
 The biggest question is who gave the right to stake the lives of children in the name of tradition
 kya maa baap ko bacchon kii jindagi aise jokhim main daalane kaa koi adhikaar he
 It is important for a human being to give time to himself and enjoy life
 har insaan ke jivan kii kuch icchhaaen hoti hai jinhen wo puraa karnaa chahta he
 We forget to live life under the burden of career, relationship, marriage and then family responsibilities
 har cheez kaa apana ek vakt hota he isliye us vakt ke nikalne ke pehle hi unhen karnaa behatar hota he
 Before you pass the age of 30, you must go through these small experiences
 
 
 1- pyaar kar len-jaise ek sharir ko jeene ke liye pani kii jarurat hoti he vaise hi aatma ko pyaar kii
 Without love, a person remains incomplete in life
 yah jaruri he ki ladkiyaan shaadi se pehle wo us har cheez se khul ke pyaar kar len, jinhen wo pasand karti hai or jo unke jivan kaa hissaa he
 Skin problems and remedies during pregnancy 2- Overcome your fear - It has often been seen that every human has a fear about something since childhood
 kai log pani se, oonchai se, gaharaai se darate hai
 Many people have the feeling of ghosts
 ladkiyaan aksar cockroach, chuhon, chhipakaliyon se darati hai
 It is important that they overcome this fear and learn the art of living freely
 isse unke andar or aatmavishvaas kaa sanchaar hoga
 3- Stay a few moments alone - It is important for a human being to try to be alone for a few moments
 vaise to doston kaa saath ek sukhad ehsaas hota he
 But sometimes, living alone also has many benefits
 isse aap aazaadee ko puri tarah mahasoos kar sakati hai or khud ke zyada kareeb ja sakati hai
 4- At least you have a key - if you have done a job and you have earned money through your hard work, then it would be better for you to buy something special for yourself with those money
 aap isse koi car yaa apartment kharid sakati hai yaa phir kuch or khaas cheez
 By doing this you will feel proud of yourself
 shaadi ke baad stri se kabhi naa puuchhen ye 7 baaten5- kuch adventuras karen-jivan main kuch romaanchak chijen karnaa bhi jaruri he
 If you challenge yourself to do something like this and play it then it will drench you with energy and that few moments will be many times more enjoyable than the infinite moments of your life
 6- videsh gum aaen-har insaan kaa sapana hota he ki wo apane desh ke baahar kii bhi duniya dekhe
 To enjoy the lifestyle and food there and become aware of the culture there
 shaadi ke baad ladakiyon ko apane life partner ke saath videsh ghoomane kaa mauka miltaa he par agar wo shaadi ke pehle apane doston ke saath yaa akele videsh ghoomane jaati hai to ye unke aage ke jivan ke liye yaadgaar lamhon main darj ho jayega
 7- Learn something new - Learning is that part of life that always helps you to be better than before
 jivan main kuch naa kuch hameshaa siikhnaa chahie
 If you learn anything interesting before the age of 30, then it will add a lot to your personality throughout your life
 8- apni body ke saath sahaj ho jaaen-tinej main bhale hi aap khud ko dusron se kam aankati rahi hon, lekin 30 kii umr paar karne se pehle aap apane sharir ke prati sahaj hona jarur sikh jaaen
 Appreciate yourself as you are
 aapaki jindagi pehle se zyada aasaan ho jaaegi
 a disease called Marfan Sydrome is congenital, identify such symptoms
 9- Keep yourself fit - 20 to 25 years of age is very important for a person
 is dauraan aapako khud ko feet rakhane kii jarurat he
 This time of negligence may prove harmful later
 10- badalen style-ek luk main rahanaa kisi ko bhi bor feel kar saktaa he
 People around you also want you to adopt new looks
 aap apane baalo ko color kar sakati hai
 Apart from this, you can adopt a new haircut or get a tattoo of your choice
 11- jaanwaron or prakruti se karen pyaar-paaltu jaanwaron ko paalna yaa phir ped-paudhe lagaana aapke shauk kaa hissaa agar naa bhi ho to bhi ek baar aap unhen apane jivan kaa hissaa banane kii koshish karen
 With this, you will learn to care and will also worry about someone
 12- aatmsuraksha-aatmanirbhar hona aaj har kisi ke liye jaruri he
 You need to make yourself physically and mentally strong
 aap judo, karata, yoga, pranyam jaisi chizon kaa abhyaas kar sakate hai
 This will make you feel very capable and complete in yourself
 13- qualeti time spend karen-vakt bahut jaldi bitta he or ek baar gaya hua vakt kabhi waapas nahin aata
 So it is important that you definitely spend quality time once
 aap kaamon kii praathamiktaayen nirdhaarit karen or samay ko kisi bhi tarah se jaaya naa hone den
 14- Must learn a new language - Knowledge of many languages will improve your personality
 zyada bhashaaen siikhnaa aapke liye kai myne main laabhadaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 15- Learn to forgive - a man is an effigy of mistakes
 jane-anjaane insaan se galtiyaan hoti rahati hai
 Mistakes tend to sour relationships
 behatar yahi hoga ki aap galatiyon ko maaf kar den
 If you succeed in saving a relationship by forgiving someone, then later you will feel good
 desh main prachand bahumat se vaapasi karne vaali modi sarkaar ke saamne chunautiyon kaa pahaad he
 Some of the challenges have arisen from the system during the last five years, while many challenges have also arisen from the promises made while winning the elections
 ab modi sarkaar inase kaise paar paaegi, yah dekhne vaali baat hogi
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the bjp-led NDA, breaking the 2014 record, achieved 351 seats, while the UPA was reduced to 100 seats, while others have also won 91 seats
 jaaniye ve koun si chunautiyaan hai, jinka narendra modi sarkaar ko saamana karnaa padegaa
 In the rallies of Article 370 Lok Sabha elections, BJP President Amit Shah has said openly that Article 370 will be removed from Jammu and Kashmir if the government is formed again with majority
 yah anuchhed jammu-kashmir ko visheshadhikaar pradaan karata he
 Many laws passed by Parliament do not apply here
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke aane ke baad nivartmaan kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bhi bayaan diya he ki sarkaar banane ke baad dhara 370 or 35e par kaam karenge
 On the other hand, the regional parties of Jammu and Kashmir have said many times that tampering with Section 370 will cause a valley to burn
 kabhi bijepi kii sahyogi rahi pidipi mukhiya mahabuuba mufti bhi anjaam bhugatne kii dhamkee de chuki hai
 How BJP will succeed in removing Article 370 by bringing a resolution in Parliament will be a big challenge
 rajyasabha main kamjor sthitirajyasabha main yun to 73 saansadon ke saath bijepi is vakt sabase badi party he
 But even by adding NDA seats, it does not reach the majority figure of 123
 rajyasabha main prastaavon ko paas karaane ke liye bahumat kii jarurat padati he
 In such a situation, how the BJP faces the majority crisis in the Rajya Sabha, it will be a matter to be seen
 siton kii agar baat karen to is vakt congress ke paas 50 sadsy he
 While Samajwadi Party, AIADMK and Trinamool Congress have 13–13 mps
 upie ko bhi ucch sadan main bahumat nahin he
 But apart from the UPA, other opposition parties also add up to 150
 sutara bataate hai ki ab loksabhaa ke baad hone vaale rajyon ke chunaav main agar bijepi banpar jeet darj karti he tabhi uski rajyasabha main siten bad sakati hai
 During the Lok Sabha elections, many economic analysts had said that the challenge will be to deal with the poor economy in front of the new government
 vajah ki arthvyavastha par mandi kaa jabada kasata ja rahaa he
 There is a decline in all business from aviation to telecom
 india today main chhapi centre for monitering indian iconomi kii report main arthvyavastha ko lekar kai gambhir chintaaen jataai gai hai
 It was said that the shadow banking sector is also in a big crisis, the scale of which is easy to share
 report main ielandeeyes samooh ke bhi dhahne ke muhane par hone kii baat kahi gai, jisane bade infrastracchar vyavsaayon ko vitt poshan kiya he
 India Today report said that 30 crore voters out of the total 90 crore in the country are in crisis
 aarthik rup se kamjor is bade varg ke paas na surakshit naukari nahin he na anya suvidhaayen
 This figure was obtained by India Today by counting the voters directly and indirectly involved in the troubled areas
 berogari kii ucch darasarkari report se bhi is baat kaa khulaasa ho chukaa he ki pichhali sarkaar main berogari ucch dar par pahunch gai
 Whereas during the campaigning for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had said to provide two crore jobs every year
 jise vipaksh chunaav main mudda banaata rahaa
 The Modi government has suffered the most attacks in the last five years on unemployment
 va eneseso kii report se pataa chalata he ki desh main berogari kii dar 1972-73 ke baad record 6
 Has reached the level of 1
 jabaki 2011-12 main yah aankada 2
 Was 2 percent
 sienii ne 2018 main 1
 Said to take 1 crore jobs
 jaahir si baat he modi sarkaar kii duusari pari main berogari se nipatna ek badi chunauti he
 In the last five years, the Kashmir issue, the Narendra Modi government could not formulate any concrete policy, which could bring peace in the valley
 pichley varshon main patharbaji kii ghatnaon main kaaphi ijapha hua
 It is a matter of fact that to solve the Kashmir problem, the Modi government took the initiative to negotiate with all the parties
 iske liye khufia beuro ke purv nideshak dineshwar sharma ko niyukt bhi kiya
 But the required results were not seen
 kashmir kii haalat varsh 2016 se or kharaab hui, jab encounter main hijbul mujahidin ke commander burhan mujffar vaani ko maar giraane ke baad hinsak pradarshnon kaa daur shuru hua
 The separatists and the army continued to face each other
 padosiyon se rishtemodi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal main padosi deshon se sambandh kya sudharenge
 Everyone will be watching this too
 darasal china se doklam ko lekar vivaad rahaa to pakistan apni karatuuton se baj nahin aayaa
 Due to which the tension with the two countries remained tense
 jab sanyukt raashtra main masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne kaa bharat ne mudda uthaaya to china ne vito kaa istemaal kar roak diya tha
 Relations with Nepal, called the Allies, were not as good as before
 nepal main madhesiyon ke andolan ke dauraan bharat ne nakebandi karte hue petrol, dawa aadi saamaanon kii aapurti roak di thi
 Due to which the people and government of Nepal got angry about India
 saamaajik taana-bane par aanchayun to kanoon rajya kaa vishay he, magar pichley 5 varshon ke dauraan desh main kuch ghatnaon ke aadhaar par modi sarkaar main saamaajik taana-bana prabhavit hone ke aarope lagate rahe
 The reason is that in most states, the BJP is the only government
 kai rajyon main mob linching kii kai ghatnaayen huin, jise supreme court ne bhi sangyaan main liya
 There were allegations of harassment of a particular community
 kai sthanon par gorakshakon kii bhi hinsa saamne ai
 In such a situation, the communal and social fabric in this new term does not come on fire, this is also a challenge before the Modi government

 Salve initially said that Sanjay Dutt is seeking only on mercy grounds and not on any constitutional basis
 salve ne apni baat shuru bhi nahin kii thi ki peeth ne kaha, aap yah nahin kah sakate ki aapke muvakkil ko 2007 main vishesh adaalat dwaara sunaae gaye faisle kaa pataa nahin tha
 The court said that the main reason in the petition for extension of time has been to put Rs 278 crore by the producers in seven films starring Sanjay Dutt
 haalanki, nyaayalay ne salve se kaha, kya unhen jaankaree nahin thi ki 2007 main ek faisla aayaa tha
 Salve said that giving Sanjay a little more time to surrender would help him fulfill his commitments
 salve ne samooche ghatnakram ko lekar kaha, jivan main aisa ho jaataa he
 When the court sought to know from them how much more time would be appropriate for the dedication, Salve said, given a little more than eight weeks, humanitarian grounds and grace can be considered
 haalanki, sibiai ke vakil or atirikt solicytor general haren rawal ne kaha ki dutt ke aagrah kaa virodh karne ke liye unke paas likhit nirdesh hai

 Salve said those petitions had raised the legal grounds associated with Article 21 of the Constitution relating to the fundamental right to life and liberty
 tippaniyan Rawal said age, poor health and other reasons were raised in the petitions, which the court rejected
 rawal ne kaha, yahaan (dutt kaa aagrah) yah vyavsaayik aadhaar he
 However, the bench said that it cannot apply the same rule in all cases and it depends on a case-by-case basis

 The Additional Solicitor General further said that accepting Dutt's request would lead to a flood of such applications and would be like an amendment to the March 21 decision

 Former captain Bishan Singh Bedi indirectly blamed the BCCI for the differences in the Indian cricket team, saying that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been misled
 bedi ne kaha, ‘‘main nahin maanata ki senior khilaadiyon kaa kshetrarakshan kharaab he
 Sachin, Sehwag and Gambhir have their own status
 lagata he ki dhoni ko gumraah kiya gaya he
 Who knows he is expressing the opinion of the BCCI
 ’’ This veteran spinner of his time made this comment about Dhoni's statement which he had recently made about the rotation policy
 bhartiya captain ne kaha tha ki senior khilaadiyon sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir kaa kshetrarakshan dhilaa he, jisase team ko lagbhag 20 ran ganvaane padate hai
 However, Sehwag later gave it a new twist by saying that he has not been told the reason for the rotation
 bedi ne iske saath hi khilaadiyon se media se duuri banaae rakhane kii apil bhi kii
 He said, "I am happy that in our time the media was not so dominant
 khilaadiyon ko media se duuri banaae rakhni chahie
 Not everyone needs to come to the media

 "he said," If the players only have to speak, then what is the job of the media manager

 '' apane jamaane ke is diggaj spinner ne yah tippanee dhoni ke us bayaan ko lekar kii, jo unhone haal main roteshan niti ko lekar kii thi
 The Indian captain had said that the fielding of senior players Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir is loose, causing the team to lose around 20 runs
 sahvaag ne haalanki baad main yah kahkar ise nayaa mode de diya tha ki unhen roteshan kaa yah kaaran nahin bataaya gaya he
 Bedi also appealed to the players to keep distance from the media
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe khushi he ki hamaare jamaane main media itnaa haaavee nahin tha
 Players should keep distance from the media
 sabhi ko media ke paas aane kii jarurat nahin he
 This should be stopped immediately
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘yadi khilaadiyon ko hi bolnaa he, to phir media manager kaa kya kaam he
 They (players) are not children
 ve lambey samay se khel rahe hai or jaanate hai ki media kis tarah kii pratikriya kar saktaa he
 The talk of the dressing room should not come out
 ’’ tippaniyan Bedi also said that he did not agree with Kapil Dev's statement advising Sachin Tendulkar to retire and appealed to leave the decision to the star batsman
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah kapil kaa maananaa he
 i understand that no one is in a position to ask Tendulkar to retire
 yah unka ekadhikaar he
 This will be their decision, no one else should have the right to speak on it
 ’’ Bedi said, "who is not waiting for his great century? sabhi unke mahashatak kii baat kar rahe hai or saath main un par talwaar bhi taan rahe hai
 The burden of this century is not only on Sachin, but the entire country
 behatari isi main he ki ham unhen akelaa chhod den
 Bedi, who was strongly critical of Dhoni's rotation policy, admitted that the Indian team had failed in every department on the Australian tour
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ab to daura samaapt hone kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The team's confidence has been badly shaken
 ’’ He said, "I am happy that in our time the media was not so dominant

 com / thqhvuwbak— Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)february 5, 2019bataa den ki is ghatana ke baad hindu samudaay ne agyaat logon ke khilaaf police main cese darj karaayaa he
 The temple was near the homes of the people of the community, so they did not hire anyone to take care of the temple, as they thought it was safe
 sthaneey media ke mutabik, ghatana ke baad ilaake ke hinduon ne shahar main pradarshan bhi kiya
 Advisor of Pakistan Hindu Council Rajesh Kumar Hardasani has demanded the formation of a special task force for the protection of Hindu temples
 unhone kaha he ki is ghatana ne hindu samudaay ke bich ashaanti paidaa kar di he
 Rajesh Kumar also says that such incidents are done to disturb religious harmony in the country
 vahiin, police kaa kahana he ki vah hamalavar kii talash kar rahi he lekin abhi tak koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Also, no person or group has claimed responsibility for this attack yet
 bataa den ki muslim bahul pakistan kii 22 karod aabaadi main hindu kareeb do fisadi hai
 Most Hindus live in Sindh province and often face persecution of extremists
 ab jabaki pakistan main imran khan sarkaar chalaa rahe hai or vah samaaj ke har varg kii suraksha kaa daawa karat hai, aise maahaul main bhi hindu mandir par atake hona chintajanak he
 Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has opposed subsidies on diesel to mobile companies and owners of luxury cars
 ramesh ne kaha he ki iske bajaay van kshetron main rahane vaale logon ko rasoi gas par chhot milani chahie, jisase pedo ko bachaaya ja sake
 Ramesh said that the purpose of the diesel subsidy is to provide benefits to the people of the agricultural sector
 par aaj yah sabsidi lagjri kaaron ke maalikon or mobile phone istemaal karne vaale ham-aap jaise logon ko mil rahi he
 "there are 4,50,000 mobile towers in the country and all use diesel," Ramesh told reporters while releasing a report on the Green Environment and Forests of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) on World Environment Day
 aise main dijal par sabsidi kyon milani chahie
 a recently released report by NGO Greenpeace states that diesel is used by telecom companies to power towers
 isse sarkaar ko salanaa sabsidi ke rup main 2,600 karod rupee kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Advocating to provide LPG subsidy to 1,72,000 villages in the forest areas of the country, Ramesh said, "only one important measure can save the forests of these areas
" unhone kaha ki in gaanvon ke log khaanaa pakaane ke liye wanon par nirbhar hai
 In such a situation, there is a great need to provide LPG subsidy to them

 - input language britain ne is baat kii tasdik kii ki aatankwaadi sanghathan islamic state kii taraf se jari kiya gaya vah video sahi he, jisamen british bandhak evam logon kii madad kaa kaam karne vaale david hens kaa sir kalam hote hue dikhaaya gaya he
 The video showed Haines, who was abducted in Syria in 2013 by terrorists, wearing an orange garment, kneeling in the sand and reading the material
 baad main kuch aisa dikhaaya gaya he, jisase lagata he ki vah hens kaa shav he
 "all indications are that the video is correct," the Foreign Office said in a statement
 america patrkaar james fole or steven sotlauf ke sir kalam kiye jane ke video kii tarah hi is video kaa ant bhi ek anya british naagarik kii hatya kii dhamkee se hota he
 Prime Minister David Cameron returned to Downing Street after midnight after the video surfaced last night
 uske baad unhone ‘cobra’ naam kii sarkari apatkaaleen samiti kii ek baithak kii adhyakshata kii or phir ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki hens kii hatya se aies ke khilaaf britain kii ranneeti nahin badalegi
 Addressing Downing Street in the morning, Cameron condemned Haynes' murder and said Britain would find and punish those responsible for it, no matter how long it took
 unhone kaha, ve musalmaan nahin, shaitan hai
 Cameron described Haynes (44) as a 'british hero' and praised his family's 'extraordinary courage'
 camran ne kaha, in hatyaron ko pakadaney or unhen nyaay ke katghare main laakar khadaa karne ke liye ham apni sari urja laga denge or isamen chaahe jitna bhi lanbaa vakt lage ham iske liye sab kuch karenge
 In the video, the murderer said, "you are voluntarily supporting America against the Islamic State, as your predecessor Tony Blair did
" inhone bhi un anya british pradhanmantriyon kaa anusaran kiya, jo america ko inkaar karne kaa saahas nahin juta sake
 The person seen in the released video is probably the same as seen in the earlier video
 usne britain ko chetavanee di ki yah gathbandhan unke ‘vinaash ko gati degaa’ or british logon ko aise hi ‘khooni yuddh main dhakelegaa jisamen unki paraajay hogi
 ' video main usne anya british naagarik kii bhi hatya karne kii dhamkee di
 David Heinz's brother Mike Heinz said, David was very lively and excited about his role as a humanitarian
 kaam ke prati unke samarpan or prasannataa kii vajah se vah syria gaye, jo mere or parivaar ke liye bahut dukhad rahaa
 US President Barack Obama has condemned the brutal murder of this British citizen by the terrorist group Islamic Group
 haal ke saptaah main ‘islamic state’ ne do america patrakaron kii bhi hatya kar di thi
 In a statement, Obama said, the US strongly condemns the barbaric murder of a British citizen Heinz by a terrorist group
 henj ke parivaar or britain ke logon ke prati hamen sahanubhuti he
 Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and French President François Olond also condemned the incident
 scotland main janme henj (44) ko syria main march 2013 main bandhak bana liya gaya tha
 Heinz's assassination was threatened in a video of an IS extremist beheading American journalist Steven Sautloff
 henj ‘agency for technical kooparation and deveopment’ ke liye kaam karte the, jo antarrashtriya raahat kaary karne vaala ek parmarth sanghathan he
 Prior to this he was also involved in humanitarian work in the African region of the Balkans and the Middle East
 sotlauf or unke saathi patrkaar james folli ko bhi syria main hi agava kiya gaya tha
 IS released separate videos on 19 August and 2 weeks later on 2 September, claiming Foley and Sotaloff's murder respectively
 dilli main lagaataar badhate pradooshanko dekhte hue centre sarkaar ne ek bada faisla liya he
 To deal with this, BS-VI rules for fuel will apply from April next year in Delhi
 mantralay ne april, 2018 se hi bies-4 kii jagah bies-6 ke norms ko lagu karne kaa nirnay liya he
 It was earlier planned to implement these norms from 2020
 badhate pradooshan ne badhaai chintadilli main lagaataar bad rahepradooshan ke str kii vajah se yahaan rahane vaale logon ko kaaphi zyada pareshaani jhelni pad rahi he
 The National Green Tribunal has also expressed concern about this many times
 sirf dilli hi nahin, iske aasapaas ke ilaakon main bhi pradooshan kaa str lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 For this reason, the Petroleum Ministry has decided to implement BS-6 norms next year instead of 2020
 6 maheenon kaa milegaa samaymantralay ke naye nirdeshon ke mutabik dilli ke paas bies-4 norms se bies-6 par shift hone ke liye sirf 6 maheene kaa vakt he
 The Petroleum Ministry issued a statement saying that this decision has been taken in view of increasing pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas
 ye bhi diya suzavatil companiyon ko 2019 sedilli ensiarmen bies-6 auto ful kii bikri karne par bhi vichaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 The Ministry of Petroleum has taken this decision only after talking to all stakeholders to implement BS-6 norms in 2018 instead of 2020
 philhal yah faisla sirf petrol or dijal ke liye kiya gaya he
 There is no change in the 2020 deadline set for BS 6 trains
 kehane kaa matlab yah hua ki agle saal se dilli main gaadiyaan to bies-4 kii hongi lekin petrol or dijal BS 6 level kaa milegaa
 What is BS-6BS-6 means Bharat Stage 6
 gaadiyaan kitna pradooshan failaati hai isko naapane ke liye bharat stage naam kaa scale banaaya gaya he
 India Stage 4 trains are currently running in the country
 pehle sarkaar kaa kaarykram 2018 se bharat stage 5 gaadiyaan or tel lagu karne kaa tha
 But the government later decided that instead of Bharat Stage 5, the government would implement Bharat Stage 6 directly in 2020
 bharat stage 6 kii gaadiyaan behad kam pradooshan karti hai or duniya ke behtareen deshon main lagu pradooshan ke niyamon kii barabari karti hai
 Now, given the pollution of Delhi, the government has extended the time limit for the implementation of Bharat Stage 6 in petrol diesel 2 years ago, but the time limit for the implementation of BS-6 in trains is still 2020
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki bharat stage 4 kii gadiyon main agar bharat stage 6 kaa tel daalaa jayega to pradooshan kam karne main puraa phayda to nahin milegaa lekin abhi ke mukaable sthiti behatar zarur ho jaaegi

 " virendra sahvaag in dinon team india main nahin he
 They prefer to stay away from the media, so they are not seen in TV channels and newspapers
 lekin gudgaanv se jhajjar ke raste par mudate hi ek bada sa board team india ke is dhuandhar ballebaaj kii yaad dilaa detaa he
 This board is Sehwag's school
 is par lagi tasviir main vah cricket khelte nahin, suut-boot pahane bacchon ko skool jane kii prerana dete najar aate hai
 The name of Sehwag is enough to give a sense of the stature of Sehwag International School
 haryana kii hariyaali ke bich bani is shandaar imaarat ko dekhte hi jhajjar jane vaala har shaks achaanak thahar jaataa he
 The attempt to meet Veeru was for several days, now i got a chance to go
 shart yahi thi ki milenge to sirf apane skool main
 On entering the school we were confronted with a splendid modern building and large grounds
 andar gaye to ek international skool kii tamaam khubiyaan saamne aane lageen
 Before we bumped the school some more, Virender Sehwag was seen smiling towards us from the front stairs
 chehre par pehle si chamak or vahi garmjoshi
 If Virender Sehwag had been elsewhere, perhaps the matter would have started with cricket
 lekin philhal skool kii baaten hone lageen
 While talking and going through the corridors of the building, we reached among the students
 science kii class chal rahi thi or skool ke principal khud bacchon ko practical kara rahe the
 Veeru started listening very carefully to everything like a true student
 unhone hamase kaha, 'hamaare skool main sirf khel hi nahin sikhaaya jaataa balki shiksha par bhi puraa dhyaan dete hai
 There are scientifically designed classes, where new methods of learning are invented
 'lab se baahar nikle or jahaan pahunche vahaan nanhe-munne bachche kisi function kii taiyaari main jute the
 Most of these children did not know who Veeru was, so there was no obstacle in their practice
 kaaphi der tak bacchon ko nihaarne ke baad viru bole, 'ham in bacchon ko rashtriya mahatv kii har baat bataate hai, jaise 2 oktober, 15 agast or 26 janvari ke myne kya hai
 Young children learn quickly in an atmosphere of dance and fun
 'sahvaag jis tarah se hamen skool or shiksha ke bare main bataa rahe the usase yakeen karnaa mushkil ho rahaa tha ki yah vahi ballebaaj he jisane cricket ke tamaam kitaabi shots ko darkinar kar uski apni hi paribhaasha garh di thi
 According to Veeru, he aims to make the character of children more than personality
 vah kehete hai ki persenality to bachche college main banaate hai lekin kairactor skool main hi ban saktaa he
 Perhaps the merit of Veeru's school is that his school has become the number-1 school in Haryana
 padhai ke bare main baatcheet kaaphi ho chuki thi ab baari thi viru ke pasandida subject khel kii
 His school has facilities of international standard for cricket, football, basketball, squash, tennis, table-tennis, swimming, badminton, wrestling
 viru maanate hai ki ek bachche ko sabhi khel khilne chahie taaki uski sabhi mansapeshiyaan majboot ban saken jo ek khilaadi banane ke liye behad zaruri he
 We grew up on the cricket ground with him
 pehali nazar main dekhte hi ye international cricket kaa koi venue dikhaai detaa tha
 The children were engaged in catching practice with their coaches
 viru bhi balla dekhakar baichaiyn ho uthe or bacchon ko batting tips dene lage
 Talking about this ground, Sehwag said, 'we have built this ground on the lines of Ferozeshah Kotla
 pich banane ke liye curator bhi vahiin se bulaae gaye the
 The Haryana Cricket Association organizes under-16 and under-19 matches at this ground
 haa, abhi ham yahaan ranjai match nahin kara sakate kyonki aasapaas hariyaali hone kii vajah se gend khone kaa khatra he
 'when the matter went to cricket, we asked if the team is preparing for a comeback in India or wishing to become a coach, Veeru replied in his own way,' If i become a coach, i don't know how players will be born, it is better
 i keep playing cricket main abhi 2-3 saal or cricket khelnaa chahta hum
 i want to return to the team by scoring runs in domestic cricket
 ipel aane vaala he or usase pehle gharelu van-de cricket bhi he
 My effort is to return to Team India by scoring as many runs as possible
 '23 acre main bane viru ke is iko-friendli skool ko dekhnaa apane aap main ek shandaar anubhav tha
 The evening was getting up and it was time for our return
 lekin chalate-chalate viru se ek sawaal hamane unke bhavishya par bhi puch liya
 We asked if Veeru is interested in playing political innings like Sachin, Azhar and Sidhu? The answer came straight from the bat, 'do you think i will ever be an MP or MLA, maybe not because i am a straight forward man
 abhi 2-3 saal or kheloongaa, phir is bare main sochoongaa ' JDU has created a stir ever since it formed a government with BJP in Bihar
 purv adhyaksh sharad yadav ke baagi tewaron ke baad ab party se 21 netaaon ko nilambit kar diya he

 Samajwadi Party has released the list of its star campaigners for the Lok Sabha election campaign
 is list main samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav, pramukh mahasachiv ramgopal yadav or rashtriya mahasachiv ajam khan ke naam to shaamil kiye gaye hai, lekin party ke sansthaapak mulaayam singh yadav kaa naam is suchi se gaayab he
 That is, Mulayam Singh Yadav will contest the Lok Sabha elections from Mainpuri on a SP ticket, but he has not been given the opportunity to appeal for a vote for the Samajwadi Party as a star campaigner
 40 star prachaarkon kii yah list samaajawaadee party ke dilli offis se jari kii gai he, jisamen sabase pehla naam akhilesh yadav kaa he
 Apart from Akhilesh, Ram Gopal Yadav, Azam Khan, Jaya Bachchan, Dimple Yadav, Rajendra Chaudhary, Ramgovind Chaudhary, Ahmed Hassan, Javed Ali Khan, Vishambhar Prasad Nishad, Surendra Nagar, Tej Pratap Yadav, Naresh Uttam Patel, Maulana Yasin Ali Usmani, Manoj Paras , Mehboob Ali and Shahid Manzoor including Kamal Akhtar and Ashu Malik have also been included in the list of star campaigners
 lekin samaajawaadee parivaar ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ko is list main jagah nahin mili he
 However, BSP supremo Mayawati will also reach her seat to campaign

 iske baad 19 april ko mainpuri main sapa-basapa or areldi ke diggaj netaa mulaayam singh yadav ke liye prachaar karne pahunchenge
 This opportunity will be historic, because leaders considered to be fierce opponents of each other will be seen on one platform
 haalanki, mainpuri main sapa kaa dabadabaa he, aise main yahaan kii raily mulaayam singh ke vot maangane se kahin zyada puure pradesh main sapa-basapa-areldi kii ekajutata kaa sandesh dena hoga
 But the name of Samajwadi Party which Mulayam Singh Yadav has taken to every corner of UP, in the list of star campaigners, also raises many questions

 Describing the Modi government's move as messing with the Constitution, he termed it as an insult to the architect BR Ambedkar

 unhone kaha ki savarna jatiyon ke aarthik pichhadepan kaa koi aankada maujuud nahin he, baavjood iske unhen aarakshan diya ja rahaa he
 While the Sachar Committee report clearly states how bad the condition of the Muslims of the country is, but nothing is done in that direction
 ovaisi ne is bill ko samanta ke khilaaf bhi bataaya
 In the last part of his statement, Owaisi said that this reservation system is also against Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution, which has no scope for economic basis
 ovaisi ne yah tark dete hue kaha ki court main yah bill tik nahin paaegi or sarkaar ise paas nahin kara sakati he
 Reservation will be strengthened by giving reservation to opponents: Ram Vilas Paswanakya fails: Modi government's poverty removal schemes which had to be brought for the poor Reservation: Thambidurai purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ne kaha he ki lokapal se to keval jail bharne kaa kaam hoga

 abdul kalam ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘kuch samay intjaar karen
 'he was asked if he was keen on a second term of the presidency
 kalam se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya unhen raashtrapati ke taur par paanch varsh kaa doosraa kaarykaal diya jaayegaa, tab is par unhone kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kiya

 maanav jivan kaa srijan karne ke liye ishwar ne nari kaa nirmaan kiya
 When a woman uses her power to create life, she is called mother
 is sristi main sabase zyada pavitra or karunamayi satta maan hi he
 That is why devotees also call God as Mother
 aisa karne se unhen ishwar kii nikatataa kaa jald anubhav hota he or maan rupi ishwar kaa lagaataar dulaar miltaa rahata he
 In astrology, which planets and zodiac signs do the mother have? - In astrology, the moon is considered to be the mother's factor
 The owner of the house can see the position of the mother by combining the planet and the moon - by the moon, you can know the mother's position to a great extent by not respecting the mother and the relationship with the mother
 What are the consequences of not keeping well? - One has to face mental stress- There is confusion in life due to some reason- One has to have mental illness or depression- One has problems in traveling - The person never gets stability in life
 What are the benefits of honoring mother? - The moon becomes easily strong - The person will get quick benefits in diseases
 A- delight the mind of a person's life is usually disconnected from the rest is hamaara soramandal 8 grahon se bana hua he
 Our Earth is also part of the Solar System
 yah surya se teesraa grah he
 The Moon revolves around our Earth
 chandramaa prithvi kaa upgrah he or yah prithvi kaa chakkar andakaar kaksha main katata he
 Eclipses read because of the movements of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon
 yah chaaya kaa saadhaaran sa khel he jo soramandal main hota rahata he
 Why is there a lunar eclipse? The simple answer to this is that the arrival of the moon in the earth's shadow
 us sthiti main surya ek taraf, chandramaa duusari taraf or prithvi bich main hoti he
 a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon comes out of the Earth's shadow
 chandragrahan poornima ke din hi padataa hechandra grahan poornima ke din padataa he lekin har poornima ko chandra grahan nahin padataa he
 The reason for this is that the Moon's orbit is bent on the Earth's orbit
 yah jhukaav takreeban 5 degree he isliye har baar chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh nahin karata
 It escapes from the top or bottom
 yahi baat suryagrahan ke liye bhi sach he
 Solar eclipses are always on the new moon day because the size of the moon is about 4 times less than the size of the earth
 isaki chaaya prithvi par choti aakaar kii padati he isiilie purnataa kii sthiti main surya grahan prithvi ke ek chote se hisse se hi dekha ja saktaa he
 But in the event of a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow is much larger than that of the Moon
 lihaaja isse guzarane main chandramaa ko zyada vakt lagata he
 In India, the lunar eclipse lunar eclipse will be seen simultaneously in the whole world and it starts simultaneously but it depends on what time of night is going on there
 kahin shaam ko chandroday ke vakt yaa uske baad dikhegaa or kahin subah chandrast ke aas-paas hoga lekin bharat kii baat karen to yahaan par chandra grahan madhya raatri main shuru ho rahaa he
 Therefore, it will start simultaneously and end simultaneously in all places of the country
