 phir kya tha dare sahame parivaar ne preet vihaar thane main shikaayat darj karvaa di
 DCP Ombir Singh said that after seeing the social media and news papers of the two brothers, the idea was that if everyone gives extortion money in the name of Neeraj Bawania, then why not ask for extortion in his name
 phir kya tha dono bhi ne niraj bavania ke naam par 2 karod kii rangadari maangi
 But they could not work and the police arrested both from Mangolpuri area
 a post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Aug 7, 2018 at 9:04am PDT Indian film composer Amaal Malik said in a tweet that Pakistani singer Atif Aslam is lacking in Bollywood
 pakistan ke akhbaar 'jang' ne apni report main jaankaree dete hue kaha ki bollywood ko aatif asalam kii kami khal rahi he or aatif abhi bhi bhartiya sangeetkaaron kii pehali pasand bane hue hai
 The report states that an Indian fan of Atif Aslam tweeted, "please lift the ban on Atif Aslam
 vah ek shandaar gayak or behtareen insaan hai
 We want songs of Atif Aslam in Bollywood
 "soshal media par kuch bhartiya yugers amaal ke twit se khush nahin hai
 Some users advised Amaal Malik to move to Pakistan to support Atif Aslam
 is twit se sahmati jataate hue amaal malik ne twit kiya ki unhen bhi aatif asalam kii kami mahasoos hoti he
 After the terror attack in Pulwama, the tension between India and Pakistan reached a height during which all Pakistani artists including Atif were banned from working in Bollywood

 - Anil Baluni (@anil_baluni) January 20, 2019 Congress MP has given a controversial statement on the health of Amit Shah
 Before this, make a controversial statement on Amit Shah by Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka, BK Hariprasad
 hariprasad ne kaha tha ki karnataka main hamaare vidhayakon ke waapas lautne se amit shah dar gaye or unako bukhaar ho gaya
 He has not had any common fever
 unako swine flu (pig Fever) hua he
 If he tries to topple the Government of Karnataka, he should know that he will not only have swine flu but will also have vomiting and loose motion
 hariprasad ke bayaan par bijepi ne palatwaar kiya tha
 Attacking Hariprasad, Union Minister Piyush Goyal said that the kind of dirty and stupid statement Congress MP BK Hariprasad has made for Amit Shah's health, shows the level of the Congress
 amit shah flu kaa upachaar kara rahe hai, lekin congress ke netaaon kii maansik beemaari kaa upachaar mushkil he
 Let us know that Hariprasad was the Congress candidate against NDA candidate Harivansh in the Deputy Speaker election of Rajya Sabha
 haalanki is chunaav main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or harivansh ko jeet mili thi
 In view of the bjp's rally rally in Ramlila Maidan today, BJP will organize Delhi BJP Vijay Sankalp rally at Ramlila Maidan today

 Mulayam Singh Yadav has changed his stand on the CM candidate of the party
 ab ve akhilesh ko party kaa siem cheharaa banane ke liye phir taiyaar ho gaye hai
 a few days ago he said that after winning the election, the mlas will decide who will be the CM
 siyaasi halkon main yah bhi afvaahen thim ki akhilesh ab apni alag party banane vaale hai
 It is believed that this is how the attempt to damage control has started
 samaajawaadee party ke state aphis ke auditorium main aaj thik us jagah or usee kursi par baithkar mulaayam ke doot or party ke rajyasabha sadsy krishnamay nanda ne mulaayam kii taraf se elaan kiya ki akhilesh hi siem candidet hai
 
 
 Whereupon three days ago, Mulayam himself said that the MLA will decide who will be the CM after the election
 krishnamay nanda ne kaha, “agali sarkaar samaajawaadee party kii hi hogi
 
 or akhilesh yadav hi uskaa cheharaa hai
 Who is the best Chief Minister of the country
 yahi mulaayam singh kaa sandesh he, jo main aapako dene aayaa hum
 "comments baap-bete kii jang main pichley dinon laga ki akhilesh akele padate ja rahe hai, kyonki akhilesh kii marji ke khilaaf mulaayam ne gayatri prajapati ko phir mantri banavaa diya
 
 
 Made Amar Singh the General Secretary
 
 
 akhilesh ke kareebi saat yuva netaaon ko party se nikaal diya
 
 
 Qaumi Ekta Dal merged with SP
 
 
 or mukhtaar ansaari kaa tikat tay kar diya
 Meanwhile, Akhilesh appeared in a public program with his young friends, who were dismissed by Mulayam Singh Yadav from the party
 or tab to hangaamaa hi ho gaya jab akhilesh ne ek intervyuu main kah diya ki ve akele chunaav prachaar main chale jaaenge, unhone to apana naam bhi bachapan main khud hi rakh liya tha
 Perhaps the 75-year-old father felt this about the young son and in a press conference he said in response to a question that "who will be the next CM will decide the MLA after winning the election
" ” After this, rumors got loud that Akhilesh Yadav was forming his new party
 
 
 ve congress ke saath ja sakate hai
 
 
 Et cetera
 
 Et cetera
 lekin aaj mulaayam singh ne akhilesh ko meeting ke liye ghar bulaayaa
 In the Samajwadi Party's State Office Auditorium, sitting in the same chair and in the same chair today, Mulayam's envoy and party's Rajya Sabha member Krishnamay Nanda announced on behalf of Mulayam that Akhilesh is the CM candidate
 
 
 jahaan se teen roj pehle mulaayam ne khud kaha tha ki siem koun hoga yah chunaav ke baad vidhayak tay karenge
 Krishnamay Nanda said, “the next government will be that of the Samajwadi Party
 
 And Akhilesh Yadav is his face
 jo desh ke sabase behtareen mukhyamantri hai
 This is the message of Mulayam Singh, which i have come to give you
 ”tippaniyan In the father-son war, Akhilesh was feeling lonely lately because Mulayam again made Gayatri Prajapati a minister against Akhilesh's will
 
 
 amar singh ko mahasachiv bana diya
 
 
 Seven young leaders close to Akhilesh were expelled from the party
 
 
 kaumi ekta dal kaa sapa main vilay kar diya
 
 
 And fixed the ticket for Mukhtar Ansari
 udhar akhilesh apane un yuva doston ke saath saarvajanik program main najar aae jinhen mulaayam singh yadav ne party se barkhaast kar diya tha
 And there was an uproar when Akhilesh said in an interview that he would go alone in the election campaign, he even kept his name to himself as a child
 shaayad 75 saal ke baap ko jawan bete kii yah baat dil ko lag gai or unhone ek press conference main ek sawaal ke jawaab main kah diya ki “aglaa siem koun hoga yah chunaav jeetne ke baad vidhayak tay karenge
 " iske baad afvaahon ne jor pakadaa ki akhilesh yadav apni nai party bana rahe hai
 
 
 They can go with the Congress
 
 
 vagairah
 
 vagairah
 But today, Mulayam Singh called Akhilesh home for a meeting
 baap-bete kii jang main pichley dinon laga ki akhilesh akele padate ja rahe hai, kyonki akhilesh kii marji ke khilaaf mulaayam ne gayatri prajapati ko phir mantri banavaa diya
 
 
 Made Amar Singh the General Secretary
 
 
 akhilesh ke kareebi saat yuva netaaon ko party se nikaal diya

 ek ke baad doosraa ghotaalaa centre kii congress sarkaar kaa peechha karata aa rahaa he
 The Congress government at the Center has been in trouble due to its scandal involving Iqbal Singh, the Lt
 Governor of Puducherry (LG), the Congress, which holds the chair in the Union Territory too, is embarrassed
 Trying to come in maamoolisi lagane vaali jaanch kaa nateeja yah niklaa kiikbal singhke sambandh kaale dhan ko safed karne vaale, kar chor hasan ali khan se ujagar hue
 Iqbal Singh's alleged inappropriate behavior has also become a source of trouble for the Congress governments at the Center and Union Territory
 uparajyapal south ajukational trust ke naam par karaikal main ek medical college kholane kii koshish kar rahe the, jisamen rajanivas ke vishesh kaary adhikari samet unke do bete or kareebi rishtedaar sadsy hai
 Iqbal Singh was accused of attempting to grab 28,000 square feet of land to build a gurdwara in this union territory, though the Sikh population here is negligible (according to statistics, there are only 120 Sikhs living here)
 is tarah pudducheri ke uparajyapal kai tarah ke vivaadon main ghir gaye hai
 Documents with India Today reveal that Iqbal Singh abused his position in an effort to help relatives, including his two sons, build trusts and open a medical college and hospital in Puducherry
 ve is baat se inkaar kar rahe hai ki unke parivaar ke sadasyon kaa south ajukational trust se koi vaasta he, lekin india today ke paas maujuud dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki chah sadasyeey trust main unke do bete amarsot singh or abhaya singh, unke rishtedaar tejinder paal singh or unke oesady je
 P
 singh ke putr chetanpal singh shaamil hai
 The papers show that this trust had acquired the necessary certificates for the medical college without following any of the procedures
 pudducheri ke rajasav mantri malladi krishna raav ne india today ko bataaya, ''mantrimandal ne us medical college ke liye koi anaapatti praaanpatr nahin diya
 He has no idea about this
 jab tak aarope sabit nahin hote tab tak mujhe nahin lagata ki uparajyapal ko pad chhodana padegaa
 Iqbal Singh, son of freedom fighter Lal Singh and Santokh Kaur, graduated from Punjab University in 1969, passed Parihana
 unke pita amritsar ke jaliyanvaala baag narsanhaar ke samay vahiin maujuud the or ve angrejon kii goli khaane se batch gaye the
 He was the Secretary of the All India Congress for 12 consecutive years and was a member of the Rajya Sabha from 1992 to 1998
 iske alaava ve paryaton, ispaat, scout evam rajbhasha jaisi mahatvapurn samitiyon ke sadsy bhi the
 He was also made an election observer in Bihar and was considered close to influential people of the All India Congress
 pudducheri congress ke sutron ne bataaya, ''akhil bhartiya congress main unki pakad or congress ke sankatmochan hone kii vajah se alaakaman ne unhen 2009 main pudducheri kaa uparajyapal niyukt karne kaa faisla kiya
 He is the Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office
 narayansami ke bhi kareebi hai kyonki donon '90 ke dashak ke shuru main rajyasabha sadsy the
 Narayanasamy said when asked about Iqbal Singh's hold in the Congress and his relationship with him, "yes, he is my friend
 main partiyon se upar uthakar sabhi rajnatik netaaon se hameshaa achche rishte rakhata hum
 In this way Iqbal is also my friend
 '' mana jaataa he ki narayansami ne unhen pudducheri kaa uparajyapal banavaane main madad kii thi
 On this question, the Minister of State said, "he is a constitutional officer of the Union Territory and the Congress Party has nothing to do with his appointment
" main us pad ke liye unka naam sujhane vaala koun hota hum or is maamle main congress party kahaan se aa jaati he
 "but when the file came to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs in June 2009, he objected to the appointment of Iqbal Singh as the Lt
 Governor of Puducherry
" is aapatti kii vajah yah thi ki ikbaal singh par bihar main chunaav sambandhi paise ke durupyog ke aarope lage the
 He used to be the election in-charge in the state during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 bihar ke rajnatik halkon main ikbaal singh ke bhrashtachar ke kai kisse chalate rahe hai
 He is now facing serious allegations of links with tax evader Hassan Ali Khan, who turned black money white
 ikbaal singh ne 1997 ke dauraan khan ko fatafat passport dene kii sifarish kii thi
 According to sources, the Ministry of Home Affairs had objected to his appointment saying that people with questionable image should not reduce the dignity of the post by appointing him to the post of Lt
 Governor or Governor
 ek adhikari ne bataaya, ''khufia beuro kii madad se vyakti kii prishthbhumi kii jaanch karke apni sifarish dene kaa kaam grih mantralay kaa tha
 After all, the appointment of a governor is the prerogative of the government of that time
 ''congress ab ikbaal singh se pallu jhadane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 He is finding that the case is former Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) p
 je
 Like Thomas can hold a grudge, the government has also begun to understand Iqbal Singh to step down
 isi vajah se grih mantralay or pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo), donon ne pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ko unase poochtacha karne kii ijaajat de di
 To retain some constitutional rights, the PMO said that the ED should visit the Raj Bhavan in Puducherry to interrogate them
 idi unhen apane daftar main bulaakar duusare abhiyukt amalendu pandey ke saamne baithaana chahtaatha
 He wanted to question the two together because the statements of the two are different
 ikbaal singh kaa kahana he ki unhone pandey ke aagrah par hi sifarish kii thi
 According to him, he had recommended the then foreign minister Inder Kumar Gujral (just before he became prime minister) to approve Khan's passport on compassionate grounds, at the behest of Congress leader Pandey
 lekin pandey ne idi ko bataaya ki ikbaal singh khan ko apane str par jaanate the or unhen yah bhi maaloom tha ki vah passport kiske liye tha
 Meanwhile, according to the documents, the South Educational Trust operates from an office near Rajnivas in Puducherry
 lekin india today ke paas maujuud kagajaat ke mutabik, uske panjikaran main ek aisi sampatti kaa naam he, jise pudducheri police ne 1999 main parvati shah hatya maamle main jabt kar liya tha
 Puducherry local activist Namadivarman says, "the Puducherry police has handed over the documents to the office of the Lieutenant for misuse of that property
" ''baad main trust ne bhartiya chikitsa parishad (emsiai) ke bataae formet main 'arhata praaanpatr' ke liye sarkaar se sampark kiya lekin yah praaanpatr jari nahin ho sakaa kyonki medical college kholane ke liye emsiai ke niyamon-300 bistar kaa aspataal-kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Chief Secretary R
 chandramohan ne ek vijyapti main kaha ki uske baad trust ne ek praaanpatr kii maang kii taaki vah dhiredhire emsiai kii sharton ko puri karne ke liye pariyojna kii khatir bank se paisa le sake
 The release said that on the basis of mci's 'certificate of Qualification', a sophisticated 'certificate of Qualification' was issued on 25 February
 lekin is praaanpatr ke aadhaar par nayaa medical college kholane ke liye emsiai main aavedan nahin diya ja saktaa
 Chandramohan said that a genuine 'certificate of Qualification' can be given only when the trust fulfills the necessary conditions of MCI
 un sharton ko swasthya seva ke nideshak parakhte hai or phir mantrimandal kii sifarish se praaanpatr jari kiya jaataa he
 But Chief Minister V
 in Puducherry
 vaidyalingam ke kareebi ek adhikari ne india today ko bataaya ki south ajukational trust ne karaikal main jameen ke liye bhoomi sambandhi samajhaite kii ek prati di thi
 When the papers came to Puducherry's health secretary for signature, they were rejected
 lekin jab file swasthya mantri valsaraj ke paas pahunchi to unhone aagrah patr main 'koi tippanee nahin' likhakar use mukhyamantri vaidyalingam ko bhej diya, jinhone use phir uparajyapal ke paas manjuuri ke liye bhej diya
 According to the rules of the Union Territory, the Lt
 Governor has the final right to grant the No Objection Certificate
 unhone kaha, ''pehali baat yah ki jab swasthya mantri ke paas ek medical college kholane kaa aagrah patr aata he to unhen 'koi tippanee nahin' kehane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 And then the Chief Minister cannot forward it to the Lieutenant Governor
 ''india today ne pudducheri ke mukhyamantri vaidyalingam se is babat sampark kiya, lekin unhone is par tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 He said, "the model code of conduct is in force and i cannot say anything about this issue and the allegations on the Lt
 Governor as he is the constitutional head of the state
" '' unke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki centreshasit pradesh kii congress sarkaar isse ba't pareshaan or mushkil main padi he
 But South Educational Trust chairman S
W
 tejinder paal singh ne ''sari khabaron ko durbhaavnapurna'' bataakar khaarij kar diya or kaha ki medical college pariyojna se ikbaal singh kaa koi sambandh nahin he
 "this is a baseless and mischievous allegation
 trust ke chah sadasyon main se uparajyapal ke do beton samet teen logon ne istipha de diya he
 The Puducherry government has not given any land to this trust
 yah trust kii ore se nijee pahal he
 He said that the trust was started to run welfare projects
 uske uddeshyon main medical college kii sthapana bhi karnaa tha
 He said that there is "tremendous mobilization" against this trust in Puducherry and the Lieutenant Governor has nothing to do with this medical college project
 lekin jab indiatode ne uparajyapal ke oesady je
 P
 singh or unke bete chetanpal singh se sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya to kai baar phone karne or sandesh dene ke baavjood donon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 Chetanpal Singh picked up the phone and just said, "I don't hear anything from you" and then disconnected the phone
 je
 P
 singh ne is samvaadadaata se 10 minute baad phone karne ke liye kaha
 Later he did not pick up the phone
 piemo se manjuuri milane ke baad idi ne rajanivas par ikbaal singh se 20 minute se zyada samay tak poochtacha kii
 His secretary said that ED officials met the Lt
 Governor at the Raj Niwas
 unhone yah bataane se inkaar kar diya ki kya idi ne unase khan ke saath sambandhon ke bare main kuch poocha yaa nahin
 "I can only tell this and nothing more than this," he told reporters
 ''nae vivaadon ke saath hi is centreshasit pradesh ke rajnatik netaaon ko lagata he ki uparajyapal ne congress sarkaar ko sharmasaar kar diya he
 But according to sources, the Lt
 Governor is in a position to allow him to step down peacefully

 hambantota main khele gaye pakistan banaam srilanka vanade mukaable main kushal perera ke shatak ke saath vah karnama ban gaya, jo aaj tak vanade cricket main nahin hua tha
 Kushal Perera's century is the 80th ODI century in this calendar year
 itane shatak keval 101 vanade match main ban gaye hai
 This is the largest number of centuries in any one calendar year
 isse pehle 2014 main kul 79 shatak bane the
 Earlier in 2013, the number of ODI centuries was 77
 isse behatar pradarshan kii baat karen to 2007 main kul 75 shatak bane the
 In this context, it is also interesting to see that the first 80 centuries in ODI cricket history were made in a long span of 14 years and 299 ODI matches were played to make them
 lekin agar is kalander saal main shatakon main kisi ek desh ke dabadabe kii baat karen to sabase zyada shatak srilankai ballebaazon ne banaae hai
 Sri Lankan batsmen have contributed a total of 13 centuries out of 80
 duusare paaydaan par dakshin africa or newzealand kii team maujuud he
 11-11 centuries have been scored by these two teams

 The Unlawful Activities (prevention) Amendment Bill, 2019 (UAPA) was also passed by the Rajya Sabha on Friday
 vidheyak par bolte hue kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki aatankwaad se ladane vaali agenciyon ko chaar kadam aage badhkar kaam karnaa hoga tabhi aatankwaad khatm hoga or in prastaavit sanshodhano kaa uddeshy aatanki aparaadhon kii drut gati se jaanch or abhiyojan kii suvidha pradaan karnaa he
 Amit Shah told the members who gave a statement against the law that you made this law and we supported the amendments in 2004, 2008 and 2013 but your eyes, views and speeches changed as soon as they went to the opposition
 unka kahana tha ki aatankwaad rokane ke liye jo bhi kanoon laayaa jaae uskaa sabhi ko samarthan karnaa chahie kyonki aatankwaad kaa koi dharm nahin hota he vah insaaniyat ke khilaaf hota he
 The Union Home Minister said, 'UAPA or any other law has no provision to designate individual terrorists
 isliye, jab kisi aatankwaadi sanghathan par pratibandh lagaaya jaataa he, to uske sadsy ek nayaa sanghathan banaate hai
 On the matter of declaring the person as a terrorist, the Home Minister gave the example of Yasin Bhatkal, saying that if Yasin Bhatkal had been declared a terrorist in 2009 itself, the circumstances would have been different
 shah kaa kahana tha ki sanstha vyakti se banati he or ghatana vyakti karata he sanstha nahin karti he isliye vyakti ko aatankwaadi ghoshit karnaa aavashyak he
 Terrorism is the problem of the whole world today, so many countries of the world have their own laws
 unhone kaha ki sanyukt raashtra sahit vishwa ke kai deshon main vyakti ko aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya jaataa he
 Amit Shah said that a lot of precautions have been taken to prevent misuse of the law
 vipaksh ke kanoon ke durupyog par jawaab dete hue amit shah ne kaha ki vipaksh ko immergency kaa samay yaad karnaa chahie jab kanoon kaa sabase zyada durupyog hua
 Shah also said that some of the accused in Samjhauta Express case were caught and later others were made accused by making a fake case due to political reasons
 amit shah ne kaha ki vartmaan main yuapie ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar, aatankwaad se judi sampatti ko keval us rajya ke dijipi ke likhit anumodan ke saath jabt kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen aisi sampatti sthit he
 Many times terrorists keep their property in different states
 aise maamalon main alag-alag rajyon ke dijipi kii manjuuri lenaa mushkil ho jaataa he or jiske kaaran hone vaali deree se abhiyukton kii sampatti aadi ko sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to seize the assets related to terrorism as soon as possible
 yah sanshodhan diji enie ko aisi sampatti ko jabt karne kaa adhikaar detaa he jo enie kii ja rahi jaanch ke sambandh main aatankwaad se judi he
 He also said that the NIA conviction rate is 91 percent which is the best globally
 kendriya mantri ne sabhi sadasyon se sanshodhan ke samarthan main aane ke liye saath aane kii apil karte hue kaha ki yah kanoon yadi ek mat ke saath paarit hota he to vishwa main hamaari agency ke liye acha sandesh jayega or vishwa ke aatankwaadiyon par hamaare kanoon kii dhamak badhegi

 The areas where elections are to be held in the second phase are also called barometer of Muslim politics
 musalamaanon ke do bade centre bareli or devband donon duusare charan main hi aate hai
 It will be the endeavor of both Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party that in this phase the gift of the vote of Muslim voters should come in their bag
 ajam kii lokapriyata daanv parasaharanpur main vivaadon main rahane vaale congress ke netaa imran masood chunaav maidan main hai to rampur main kaddavar muslim netaa ajam khan khud hi ek mudda hai
 Azam Khan's son Abdullah Azam will try his luck from Rampur's Swar seat for the first time
 vah pehali baar chunaav maidan main hai, lekin is seat se maujuuda vidhayak kazim ali ko kadi takkar de rahe hai
 Kazim Ali, son of senior Congress leader Begum Nurbano and popularly known as Naved Mian, has now left the Congress and joined the BSP
 lekin is baar khud ajam khan bhi charchaa main hai
 Development work has been done in Rampur, but the dominance of Azam Khan and bulldozer love is very much in the people
 ajam khan ko unki seat par chunauti de rahe hai is ilaake ke lokapriy doctor tanwir jo bispi ke ummidavaar hai
 Azam Khan has sent him to jail twice
 doctor tanwir pichhali baar bhi ajam khan ke khilaaf chunaav lade the or duusare number par rahe the
 Azam Khan is not only the Muslim face of the Samajwadi Party, but has won this assembly seat seven times
 rampur ke sabhi vidhansabha siton par unki lokapriyata daanv par hogi
 Three veterans of a village in Jehanpur, former Union Minister of Congress Jitin Prasad, will try to reach the legislature from their Tilhar seat
 bareli kii nawabganj seat bhi charchaa main he jahaan par ain chunaav ke pehle bispi chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hue kesar singh ko tikat mila he
 The special thing of this seat is that here BJP candidate Kesar Singh Samajwadi Party candidate Bhagwat Sharan Gangwar and Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Virendra Singh Gangwar all three are from Ahmedabad
 nawabganj seat par pehle samaajawaadee party ne shivpal yadav kii vishwaasapaatr shahila taahir ko tikat diya tha
 But Akhilesh Yadav, after taking charge of the party, discharged Sahila Tahir and fielded Bhagwat Sharan Gangwar
 ab vah tawqir raja kii party ittehad e millat council ke tikat par chunaav lard rahi hai
 The areas around Bareilly have a large population of Gangwar Kurmi voters
 unka vot hasil karne kii koshish samaajawaadee party ke alaava bijepi bhi jor shor se kar rahi hai
 After the first phase of voting, BJP President Amit Shah said that in the second phase, he will face BSP
 mayawati kii ranneeti kii parikshalekishmit shahaisa jaanboojhkar ek ranneeti ke tahat kah rahe hai
 In fact, BJP does not want the Muslim voters to completely shift towards the Samajwadi Party and Congress alliance
 bispi is ilaake main majbootee se chunaav ladati he to bijepi ko bhi phayda hoga
 That is why in the second phase too, the trend of Muslim voters will be seen
 isi charan se yah baat bhi saaf ho jaaegi ki sau muslim pratyaashiyon ko maidan main utaarne kii mayawati kii ranneeti kaamyaab ho rahi he yaa nahin

 He said that this reminded him of his slow journey in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh and bullock carts with his mother during his childhood

 This campaign is to make the chance of coming back to power with a mandate of 163 out of 200 assembly seats in the state worthwhile

 She continued to insist on the slogan of Shmodi Zindabadya in her meetings during the campaign
 raaje vaada karti hai ki modi ne gujarat main jo kiya, vahi ve rajasthan main doharaaengi
 She says, "if the picture of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh can change in 10-15 years, why can't we?" And people are also believing their words

 Such people are worried that the supply of drinking water and repairing the network of 20,000 km of roads in 40,000 villages of the state can prove to be quite a daunting task
 par unhone in logon ko ‘‘nirashaavadi’’ kahkar jhatak diya or congress netaa ashok gahalot ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal main hui durdasha ko ujagar karne ke iraade se aage gayi

 At that time, he was very much aware of the image of his royal family

 What is their plan? Lashing out at the Gehlot government's bailout schemes, she says, "now not a bailout, the problem will be solved
" logon ko kuch sau rupye dene ke badale unhen pani, bijli, adhyaaapak, doctor, sadaken or rojgaar ke liye hunar dijie
 However, Raje also does not want to withdraw the concessions that the Gehlot government has provided
 ve manaregaa or khaadya suraksha jaisi bahuprachaarit kendriya yojanaon kii kamyaabi par sawaal uthaati hai
 According to Raje, similar schemes for all states at the Center will not work in Rajasthan
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘mujhe apane 33 jilon main parivartan ke liye 25,000 karod rupye kii darkaar he
 Return me my money, not your plans

 He said that the number of doctors being prepared every year in the state is just 700 whereas there is a shortage of 9,000 doctors
 ve kahati hai ki schuli shiksha kii vyavastha sabase bure haal main he
 On the other hand, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress President and Union Minister of Corporate Affairs Sachin Pilot termed Raje's plan of "sarkar Aapke Dwar" as an election shock and misuse of government machinery and money
 unke shabdon main, ‘‘haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bharatpur divijan or uske aasapaas ke ilaake bijepi ke liye sabase kamjor kadi rahe hai isliye mukhyamantri in ilaakon main bijepi ke pair jamaana chaahati hai, taaki loksabhaa chunaavon main chah sansadeey siton par phayda ho sake

 bollywood ke mashhoor abhinayta or ‘nawab pataudi’ saf ali khan tathaa abhinetri karina kapur kii shaadi is saal oktober main hogi tathaa isse jude kaarykram dilli or mumbai main honge
 In the film Heroine, Kareena has given the hottest scene ever
 tasveeron main dekhe karina kii film 'heroin' kaa first luk
 Saif's mother and veteran actress Sharmila Tagore aka Ayesha Begum said that her sons Saif and Kareena will get married in October this year
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki bhopal evam haryana main shaadi kaa koi samaaroh nahin hoga or ye kaarykram mumbai evam dilli main honge
 Preparations for the wedding have been started

 Sharmila said that all the Hajis of the erstwhile princely state of Bhopal will get a place to stay in Rubat from next year, as aukaf-e-shahi prepares to buy another rubat
 is baithak kii adhyakshata sharmila ne hi kii
 The main issue in the meeting was that all the people, including the city Qazi, had demanded that the Nazir of Rubat be made a Bhopal resident
 saudi kanoon ke mutabik najir kaa pad sirf mutavalli ko diya ja saktaa he, isliye rizvi intjaam ke liye niyukt kiye gaye hai
 It was also told in the meeting that the Saudi government acquired one rubat and compensated it to about 470 lakh riyals aqaf-e-shahi, which is safe, while the current rubat will also be acquired after the Hajj this year
 dono rubaat kaa muaavja itnaa hoga ki ek aisi rubaat kharidi ja sakati he, jisamen lagbhag ek hajaar hajiyon ko suvidhaayen di ja saken
 Apart from this, aukaf-e-shahi is also considering giving convenience of rubat to the people in Umrah during Ramadan
 is bare main cameti kaa gathan ho chukaa he or vah aukaaf kii nitiyon par karrwai karegi

 The opposition is constantly attacking the Modi government over the Rafale deal
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kehane par aanan-fanan main kanoon badalakar rafel deal kaa contract anil ambani kii company ko de diya gaya or is deal main karodon kaa ghotaalaa hua he
 While the government is rejecting all the allegations outright
 darasal agle kuch maheenon main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai
 The Congress will try its best to cash in on this issue
 jabaki sarkaar kaa kahana he ki rafel deal main koi bhrashtachar nahin hua he
 Contracts have been awarded to Anil Ambani's company within the purview of the law
 yah masalaa pichley dinon sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan main sansad main bhi jor-shor se uthaaya gaya tha
 One issue of Rafale deal is big, so 'aaj Tak' along with Karvy Insights tried to know the mood of the country on it
 isi maheene is mudde ko lekar ek survey kiya gaya
 In the survey, the public was asked whether you think corruption has happened in the Rafael Deal? In the survey, 30 percent people said that corruption has happened in Rafael Deal
 jabaki 32 fisadi logon ne mana ki is saude main koi dhaandhlee nahin hui he
 At the same time, 23 percent people said that they have no information about the Rafale Deal
 baaki bache 15 fisadi logon ne rafel deal par kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 After this, questions were asked about the Rafale Deal in all the four parts of the country
 sawaal vahi tha ki kya aap maanate hai ki rafel deal main bhrashtachar hua he? uttar bharat main 27 fisadi, purvi bharat main 26 fisadi, dakshin bharat main 40 fisadi or pashchimi bharat main 29 fisadi logon ne mana ki rafel deal main bhrashtachar hua he
 Whereas in women and men the same question was asked separately
 survey main 28 fisadi mahilaon ne kaha ki rafel deal main bhrashtachar hua he, jabaki 32 purushon ne mana ki is deal main dhaandhlee hui he
 After this, a picture is clear from this survey that only 30 percent of the people of the country believe that corruption has happened in the Rafale Deal
 is survey main janata se yah bhi poocha gaya ki rafel kaa contract reliance ko dilaane main piem modi kii bhoomika thi? 35 fisadi logon ne mana ki piem modi kii madad se reliance ko rafel kaa contract mila
 While 34 per cent people rejected such allegations outright
 kareeb ek-tihaai, yani 31 fisadi logon ne jawaab dene se manaa kar diya yaa phir kaha ki unhen is bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 When asked the same question separately in all the four parts of the country, the figures showed a great difference
 dakshin bharat ke 46 fisadi log maanate hai ki piem modi kii hastkshep se reliance ko contract mila
 While 32 per cent in North India, 27 per cent in Eastern India and 36 per cent in Western India said that PM Modi had a role in getting the contract to Reliance
 linganupaat main isi sawaal par 37 fisadi purushon ne or 32 fisadi mahilaon ne mana piem modi kii bhoomika thi

 "har kisi ko jindagi main ek baar hostel life jarur jini chahie
 "this statement is not of a great man but of a hostel who comes out of the hostel
 ghr se dur hostel ek aisi duniya he jahaan khushi or gam donon milte hai or inke saath ham jindagi jeena sikh jate hai
 Find out why hostel life is so special for everyone: We have a lot of tantrums about food before the hostel arrives at the hostel
 ham aalu to khate hai lekin lowki nahin, daal main jarurat se zyada pani or mote chaaval hamaara mood kharaab kar dete hai
 But when your tantrums become airy when you come to hostel, you do not even know yourself
 hostel main aapse poochkar menu nahin banaaya jaataa he
 Therefore, you have to eat what is served
 shuruaati daur main to kaiyon ke nakhre jas ke tas rahete hai lekin ek maheenaa puraa hua nahin ki sabaki akl thikaane a jaati he
 We start eating everything
 vaise to hostel kaa khaanaa kabhi lajij nahin hota he, phir bhi acha lagata he
 The strict rules of the hostel The first rule that is told with entering the hostel is that you have to reach the hostel before 10 pm
 agar aap aisa nahin karenge to aapke parents se baat karne baad hi daravaaje khole jaaenge
 Hearing this rule, parents are happy as they live there and sad
 dopaher kaa khaanaa 1 baje se milanaa shuru hoga or raat kaa 8 baje
 If you delay for any reason, then inform about it otherwise food is over
 is jagah sabase zyada kaam aati he megi
 But now she has also left, so she eats a biscuit
 yahaan aapako kisi bhi tarah ke electrinic upkarnon ke istemaal kii manaahi hoti he
 Somewhere you have kept the press and if Vardan comes to know about it then it is not good
 hostel main baahar ke logon se milane-julne par kade niyam hote hai
 You can come to meet the one whose name is registered
 koi or aayaa to aapse pehle aapke parents ko pataa chal jaataa he ki aapse milane koi aayaa tha
 dosti-yarihostal's yari-dosti is something that teaches you to be happy in every situation
 is dosti ko ap ta-umr yaad rakhte hai
 The person who lives with you becomes the closest to you
 raat main ghar kii yaad aae tab aapke room partner hi aapke aansu ponchhate hai
 Sometimes the view is worth seeing
 jab kisi ek ko chup karaane main duusare kymotional drama shuru ho jaataa he
 Friendship is played here as if you know each other through birth
 aazaadee or mouj-mastighar main uthne kaa or sone kaa niyam hota he
 First of all, students break into the hostel
 yahaan din shuru hota he raat main or raat hoti he din main
 Now the question is what happens in the night, then in response every hostel will say that singing songs, watching movies
 yahi nahin 10 baje khaanaa kha lene ke baad dobaaraa raat main 2 baje uthakar kuch chutur-puter khaanaa aam baat hoti he
 Not only this, making tea secretly from 'jugaad' is also its own fun
 sabase kaaman baat ki saare hostellers kapade raat main hi dhone baithte hai
 The witchiness of the wards is that if someone draws the most eyes, then it is the warden of the hostel
 wo ek aisa sadsy hoti he jiske andar hitler kii aatma basii hoti he
 The beginning and end of the talk revolves only around the law and order
 shuru-shuru main apko wardan bilkul bhi nahin bhaataa, lekin samay bitne ke saath aap uske aadi ho jate hai or uski takalifon ko bhi samajhane lagate hai
 Not only this, there is a slight softening in Vordan's voice as well
 ghar se lautne par jab machati he lootsbase zyada intjaar hostellers ko is baat kaa hota he ki ghar se koun aayaa he
 Coming from home would have meant many things to eat with you
 bas phir kya aapke bag kii puri checking minuton main ho jaati he
 You go to take a bath to erase the fatigue of the road and by the time you come back the mother's hand made gram flour, mathri and namkeen has disappeared
 ol time alertyaha rahane vaale har bande ko sachet rahane kii aadat pad jaati he
 You have to take care of how much stuff you have and how to keep it
 mani managementostel main aakar aap mani management sikh jate hai
 The biggest thing is that one suddenly realizes that everything costs big money
 isliye chip and best rasta nikaalane main hostellers kaa jawaab nahin hota
 By the way, whenever you need to in the middle, you can ask for money from home with a large aram
 gharavaale bhi hameshaa extra paise bhejte hai taaki ghar se dur aapako koi pareshaani na ho
 Hostel Clothes: You may not have noticed that we wear clothes in full manner before coming home
 yahaan aakar pyjama-tishart ke alaava koi or samaj nahin aata he
 Most well-known hostels are prepared when the family comes to meet them

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was praised by leaders around the world for his soft-heartedness and gentleness, expressed his dismay at the use of harsh words in the country's politics on the occasion of Independence Day, reminding leaders that doing so is against our liberal and tolerant tradition

 "he said," There is and should be scope for conflicting ideologies in the debate on important issues in our country
 main sabhi raajnneetik dalon se anurodh karnaa chaahunga ki ve is vishay par vichaar karen
 "he said that i want to say one more thing which is related to our culture and glorious traditions

 The Maharashtra government will fully assist the CBI in the Sheena Bora murder case
 jarurat padi to is maamle jaanch karne vaale rajya police ke adhikari bhi sibiai kii madad ke liye tainaat kiye jaaenge
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis himself seems serious about the matter
 unhone saaf kar diya ki maamla gambhir he isliye sibiai se jaanch karaane kaa faisla liya gaya
 Significantly, the Maharashtra government had requested the CBI to investigate the Neshina Bora murder case
 jise sweekaar karte hue sibiai ne is maamle kii jaanch ke liye hami bhar di he
 Fadnavis gave this information to the media himself
 mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki shina bora hatya maamle main jaanch kaa jimmaa lene ke liye unhone pehle centresarkaar or sibiadhikariyon ke saath anaupchaarik baatcheet kii thi
 The CBI then agreed to take over the investigation
 grih vibhaag kii jimmedaari bhi sanbhaalane vaale fadanvis ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ne sibiai se jaanch karaane kaa faisla isliye liya ki is cese main ‘kai vittiya pahalu’ jude hue hai
 The state government felt that it would be easy for the CBI to investigate various aspects related to this case
 saath hi unhone bataaya ki agar jarurat huyi to rajya sarkaar sibiai ko jaanch main sahyog ke liye apane adhikari muhaiyaa kara sakati he, jaisaa usne andhvishwaas virdohi narendra dabholkar kii hatya ke maamle main kiya tha
 Despite the Supreme Court's decision, former Punjab Chief Minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal has been staying in the government bungalow given by the Punjab government in Chandigarh for the last several years
 court ne haal hi main purv mukhyamantriyon ko sarkari bengala or suvidhaayen chhodane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The name plate at the official residence of former Chief Minister Rajinder Kaur also has the status of former Chief Minister written under her name
 dilachasp baat ye he ki philhal rajinder cor bhatthal na to vidhayak hai or na hi kisi anya sanvaidhanik pad par hai, phir bhi unhen punjab sarkaar kii ore se purv mukhyamantri hone ke naate hi yah bangala aavantit kiya gaya he
 'government bungalow for security' Rajinder Kaur's government bungalow has been questioned many times by the opposition but Bhatthal says that he was not given this government bungalow as former chief minister but to protect it from the threat of terrorism has given
 unka kahana he ki khalistaan samarthak aatankiyon kii taraf se unke parivaar ko lagaataar dhamkiyaan milti rahi hai isi vajah se suraksha ke maddenjar unako chandigarh main ye sarkari nivas diya gaya he
 The former CM said that she is taking facilities from the government only as this accommodation, she does not get facilities equal to any cabinet minister
 lekin asaliyat main rajinder cor bhatthal ko punjab sarkaar kii taraf seescort pisiar vaahanbhi die gaye hai or unhen apane sarkari bangale main naukar or muft bijli-telephone jaisi tamaam suvidhaayen bhi uplabdh hai
 However, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal says that if any notification will be issued by the Punjab government after the Supreme Court's directive, then she will vacate this government bungalow immediately
 rajasthan main raaje ke naam 2 bangalesupreme court ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantriyon ko bangala khaali karne ke liye bhale hi kah diya ho lekin rajasthan sarkaar bhi par iskaa koi asar nahin pad rahaa padataa dikh rahaa he
 Rajasthan has 5 bungalows allotted in the name of Chief Minister and former Chief Ministers
 supreme court ne jaise hi pichley saal uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangala khaali karne ke liye kaha tha, akhilesh sarkaar ke saath-saath vasundhara sarkaar ne bhi purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangale kii suvidha ke liye bill paarit kar diya tha
 Now once again, the Supreme Court has asked the former Chief Ministers to vacate the allotted bungalows, while former Chief Minister and Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot is writing a letter asking the Vasundhara government to make rules and rules to vacate their bungalow
 rajasthan main siem mukhyamantri vasundhara jab chunaav haarane ke baad netaa pratipaksh baniin to vipaksh ke netaa ke naate unhen yah jo bangala mila tha vahiin bangala unhone siem banane ke baad bhi apane paas rakhaa
 cm's official residence - 13 civil lines have remained vacant since then
 yani rajasthan ke mukhyamantri vasundhara ke naam do-do bangale aavantit hai
 The vacant government bungalow, in front of Chief Minister Raje's bungalow, former Chief Minister and Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot has got the number 42 bungalow as the former Chief Minister
 uske thik bagal main purv mukhyamantri or uparashtrapati bhairo singh shekhavat ke naam se 14 number kaa bangala aavantit he
 In this, after his death, his son-in-law Narpat Singh Rajvi, who is also a BJP MLA
 isi tarah se jaipur main aspataal road par purv mukhyamantri jagannatha pahadiya ke naam bhi ek bangala aavantit he
 BJP MLA Ghanshyam Tiwari is saying that both Congress and BJP have got together in the name of taking a bungalow and together they have secured a bungalow for themselves if they become former
 vasundhara sarkaar ne rajasthan vidhansabha main jo bill paarit kiya gaya he uske anusaar ek baar jo mukhyamantri rah gaya, rajyapal ban jaae yaa raashtrapati ban jaae, kuch bhi nahin rahe phir bhi rajasthan sarkaar aaajeevan unhen bangala degi

 Nagpur
 
 
 maharashtra ke tisare bade shahar nagpur ko aaj ‘santaron kii rajdhani’ ke naam par janaa jaataa he
 The city was established by the Gond dynasty, the ruler of Deogarh, until the 19th century the city was the capital of central India
 lekin yahaan marathaon kii aabaadi zyada hone ke kaaran is shahar ko maharashtra main shaamil kar diya gaya tha
 When the British arrived in India, they made it the capital of Maharashtra
 aaj ke samay main nagpur ek bada raajnneetik sthaan bhi he, kyonki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) kaa mukhyalay isi shahar main he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is accused by the opposition parties that Nagpur is their main power center
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 Party leaders tried hard to persuade him, even went on hunger strike but he did not agree
 buudhvaar ko rahul ne twitor par pehle chaar panne kii chitthee post kii, phir apana profile apadet kar congress adhyaksh kii jagah congress sadsy kar diya
 Rahul resigned from the post of president but neither the party is renounced nor the tone
 rahul ne aashwast kiya he ki vah party ke liye hameshaa uplabdh rahenge
 However, Rahul has not indicated what his role will be in the party ahead
 rahul kii chitthee kaa sandesh spasht he, unhone bhi yah maan liya he ki vartmaan congress bhartiya janata party ko maat nahin de paaegi
 a new Congress is necessary for this
 kamjor hoti ja rahi congress par uthte sawaalon ke bich rahul ne antim saans tak congress ke liye ladane kii patibaddhta vyakt kii he
 In the political circles, this is seen as an acknowledgment by Rahul Gandhi that the Congress is fighting for the existence
 anya netaaon par badha istipha dene kaa dabaavarahul gandhi ne samuhik jimmedaari kii baat kii he
 Rahul has also given a message to kill his hunger for strength
 iske bhi siyaasi nihitarth nikaale jane lage hai
 Politicians are calling it a gesture to change the picture of the government in Congress ruled states
 rahul ke istife se party sanghathan main badlaav hoga hi, congress shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon par bhi istipha dene kaa dabaav bad gaya he
 The poor performance in the states is believed to fall on the chief ministers
 antarkalah kii ore ishaaraarahul gandhi ne bhaajapa se ladate rahane kii patibaddhta vyakt karte hue akele pad jane kaa zikr kiya
 There has been talk of discord in the Congress
 rahul ke akele padane kii baat ko antarkalah kii ore ishaara mana ja rahaa he
 Even during the election process, Rahul had asked the big leaders not to ask for tickets for the family
 lekin rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ke putr congress ke tikat par chunaav lade
 Rahul's sentiment suggests that all is not well in the party
 bhaajapa ke saath aresas se bhi congress ko ladanaa hogacongress ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dene ke baavjood rahul ke tevar nahin badale hai
 The second page of his letter is entirely in the name of BJP, bjp's Idea of new India, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and elections
 rahul ne phir se dwesh-ghrinaa kii raajnneeti kaa zikr kar bhaajapa par hamalaa kiya he
 Rahul has written to the organizational structure of the party that we did clean politics
 vah dwesh or ghrinaa kii raajnneeti karte hai, main pyaar kii raajnneeti karata hum
 Rahul has pointed to the social harmony, violence and said that there have been many notes in the country
 yah hamaari pahchaan rahi he
 The questions raised on the election process, not even the media and the judiciary, have spared the BJP and the Sangh as well as the media, the judiciary and the Election Commission
 rahul ne desh kii sansthaaon ke sangh ke kabje main hone kii baat kar bhaajapa sarkaar ko gheraa, vahiin loktantr kamjor hone kii baat kar yah sandesh bhi diya ki sansthaaon kii swaittata behaal karne ke liye congress jaruri he
 Rahul described the future of India as full of pain and violence and also took out the slogan of Modi's faith in everyone
 sabase zyada garib or dabe-kuchle tabko ke prabhavit hone kii baat kar bhay ko bhi hawa diya
 Rahul also targeted the judiciary and the media, as well as questioning the election process
 piem modi par bane rahenge hamalavarrahul gandhi ne congress kaa adhyaksh pad chhodte hue bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Rahul talked about not hiding corruption by winning elections
 ise is baat kaa sanket mana ja rahaa he ki vah bhaajapa ke sabase bade netaa ko torget karne kii apni ranneeti par hi bane rahane vaale hai
 His attitude in Rahul's letter indicates that he has resigned as the party's president, but has not put up arms in front of the BJP and the Sangh
 rahul ne nai congress, nae tevar ke saath aage or ladaai kaa sandesh bhi de diya he

 '' himalay kii parvat shrinkhalaaon main apni divya chata bikherta nilkanth parvat wo sthaan he jahaan bhagwaan vishnu badrinaath rup main virajman hai
 Badrinath Dham not only keeps a separate place in the shrines of Lord Vishnu, as well as the idol of Lord Badri installed here is also unique
 aamtaur par duniya ke saare vishnu mandiron main bhagwaan kii aradhana unke khadey rup main kii jaati he, magar badrinaath dham main bhagwaan kaa vigrah padmasana kii mudra main he
 It is believed that once Lord Vishnu was absorbed in penance, mother Lakshmi bowed over him as a plum tree to protect her from the harsh sunlight as long as she continued to perform penance
 baad main bhagwaan vishnu ne unke prem or samarpan kaa sammaan karte hue is sthaan ko badrinaath kaa naam diya, kyonki sanskrit bhashaa main ber ko badri kaha jaataa he
 Even today when one chants Badrinath Dham, first comes the name of 'badri' i
e
 Mother Lakshmi and later 'nath' means Lord Vishnu
 bhagwaan badrinaath ke darshan karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Before this darshan, the devotees take a bath in the heated pool and perform de-purification and then pray for Lakshmi ji and wish for peace and happiness
 tapt kunda ke paas hi kai garm jal kii dharaaen hai, jinamein aushadhiy gun bataae jate hai
 It is also believed that this bath relieves the sins of birth conversion
 aasaan nahin he bhagwaan badrinarayan ke darshanabhagwan badrinarayan kii darshan yatra main jitna mahatv bhagwaan ke vigrah kaa he utana hi mahatv is pavitra parvat nilkanth kaa bhi he, kyonki dharmik manyataon main yah sirf parvat hi nahin, balki saakshaat shiv hai or is kshetra kii yahi mahima bhakton ko ko dur-dur se yahaan tak khinch laati he
 Lord Badrinath only offers devotees six months of summer, the remaining six months have their doors closed, but during this time they are also worshiped by rituals
 isamen insaanon ke jane kii manaahi hoti he
 Surely you must be wondering who worships them behind closed doors, then let us tell you that in winter the right of worship of Badrinath goes to Gods and Mother Lakshmi, the holy land on which Narayana himself sits and The temple is built by the Gods with their own hands, the same sacred land and the temple is Badrinath
 keval 6 maheene hi hote hai darshanais pavitra dham ke darshan bhakt keval garmiyon ke chah maheene main kar sakate hai, kyonki baaki ke 6 maheene devtaa narayan kii puja karte hai
 The story behind this is very interesting
 kehete hai satyuga main narayan badrikashram main saakshaat nivas karte the
 In Tretayuga, the sage Muni, who did hard penance, was able to see Vishnu, but when the Dwapara Yuga came, Lord Krishna went to take Krishna, then not only the sage Muni but also the gods also became rare
 jab lambey vakt tak devataaon ko narayan ke darshan nahin mili to wo ghabara gaye or vishnu se darshan dene ke liye prarthana karne lage
 Then Vishnu figured out a way by which he could see the gods and humans alike, giving them a chance to worship and worship
 vishnu ne kaha ki kaliyug main jab insaan dharm-karm hin ho jayega or uske andar abhimaan samaa jayega tab wo insaanon ke saamne saakshaat rup main nahin rah paayenge
 In such a situation, he will see devotees through a statue of him lying in Alaknanda under Narada Shila
 unki baaten sunakar devataaon ne naradakund se murti nikaal kar vishwakarma se ek mandir main murti kii sthapana kara di
 The temple was named Badrinath and Narada was appointed as the principal architect
 tab yah bhi praavdhaan rakhaa gaya ki badrinath main narayan kii puja kaa adhikaar 6 maheene ke liye manushyon ko hoga or baaki ke chah maheene devtaa puja archana kar sakenge
 After pop singer Lady Gaga performed at the Oscars, her family found out that she had been raped
 auskar main apni parformens ke dauraanlady gagayon hamale kii 50 peeditaaon ke saath shaamil hui thim
 People magazine reported that he was raped at the age of 19 with the Poker Face star, but did not tell many of his family members about the sexual abuse he had committed
 instagram par kiye gaye ek post main 29 saal kii gaaga ne kaha ki 'til it happence tu you' kii jabardast parformens ke baad unki daadi or chachee ne unhen phone kiya or unki bahaduree kii tarif kii
 Gagne wrote, 'I was very embarrassed, very scared
 mere saath galat hua he yah maanane main mujhe khud lanbaa samay laga, kyonki main catholic hum or main jaanati thi ki yah bura he lekin main samajhati thi ki yah meri galati thi
 My grandmother (in the middle) and my Aunt Sheri (on the right) both called me the day after the Oscars because i never told them i was a survivor
 i was too ashamed
 Too afraid
 And it took me a long time to even admit it to myself because I'm Catholic and i knew it was evil but i thought it was my fault
 i thought it was my fault for ten years
 The morning after the Oscars when i talked to my grandmother Ronnie, with tears in her eyes i could hear them welling through the phone she said to me "my darling granddaughter, I've never been more proud of you than i am today

 ’’ The boycott of the bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for nine years in the wake of the Gujarat riots in the US ended today with his ambassador Nancy Powell meeting him
 modi or nancy kii mulaakaat kaa agenda saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya he, jabaki america ne kaha he ki yah mulaakaat tamaam tarah ke bhartiya netaaon ke saath badhate sampark-samvaad kaa hissaa he
 The US had turned its back on Modi since the Gujarat riots and refused to grant visas since 2005
 usne achaanak palati khate hue modi ke saath nancy kii mulaakaat kaa aagrah kar bhaajapa netaa ke bahishkaar khatm karne kaa sanket diya tha
 This is the first time in the last 13 years that an American Ambassador level officer came here to meet Modi
 modi ne phulon se or haath mila kar apane ghar main america shishtmandal kaa swaagat kiya
 Meanwhile, the US put an end to these speculations that the visa ban imposed on the BJP candidate for the post of Prime Minister will be lifted by the US ambassador's meeting with Modi
 america ne jor diya ki modi ko le kar uski vija niti main koi tabdili nahin ai he
 After Modi's visa was canceled, he was met by a consular level officer of the Mumbai consulate in the US
 baad main, bhartiya raajnneeti main apana kad badhane ke saath hi, modi ne america ke chote adhikariyon ko mulaakaat kaa vakt dena band kar diya tha
 However, the Modi government has always welcomed the US business delegation
 america kaarobaari netaa ‘wibrant gujarat’ jaise kaaryakramon main hissaa lete rahe
 After the travel ban, Modi would communicate with Indians in the US through video conferencing
 ahmedabad main nancy aaj gujarat vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa shankarasingh waghela se bhi mulaakaat karengi
 This meeting with Vaghela will take place at his residence
 nancy modi se mulaakaat ke baad congress netaa se milengi
 Later, Nancy would also go to the NGO 'seva'
 vah pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay petroleum vishvavidhyalay bhi jaaengi
 The US has made it clear that it is not taking any stand in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 america videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa jine saki ne kal kaha tha ki america kisi desh main chunaav main koi rukh nahin letaa
 Nancy's meeting with Modi is no example of America taking a stand in elections
 jine saki ne ek dainik samvaadadaata sammelan kaha, ham koi rukh nahin lete
 So, it will not be an expression of that
 jaisaa ham kai baar kah chuke hai, yah vibhinn prishthbhumi vaale, vibhinn raajnneetik judaav vaale adhikariyon kii ek shrunkhlaa tak hamaari pahunch kaa pratibimb he, jo ham duniya bhar ke deshon main karte hai
 Ignoring the Indian side's demand to restore the status quo along the border, China on Wednesday upheld its earlier stand and said its troops had not violated the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh region
 china kii videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua chuning ne kaha, ‘‘main is baat ko doharaana chaahati hum ki china ke sainik dwipaksheeya samjhauton kaa kadai ke saath paalan karte hue kaam kar rahe hai or elesi par apni ore saamaanya gasht laga rahe hai
 "she was replying to a flag meeting between the army of the two countries on Tuesday and a question asked by India to restore the status quo
" hua ne beete 22 april ko die apane bayaan ko doharaaya
 This makes it clear that China maintains the stand that there is no violation of LAC and that its troops can remain in the same place until a solution is reached through dialogue
 unhone kaha ki donon pakshon ne seemaa vivaad par vichaar-vimarsh vyavastha ke tahat is mudde par charchaa karne ke liye ‘sampark madhyam’ khole hai
 Along with this, he said that both sides should stick to the agreed upon LAC
 hua ne kaha, ‘‘donon pakshon ko sahmati kaa anupaalan karnaa chahie jo donon ke hit main he

 She reached the hospital with Lina

 The five-year-old girl, who herself ate morsel from her mother's hand, was pregnant
 
 
 wo ek bachche ko janm dene vaali thi
 When Leena reached the hospital, she was eight months pregnant
 doctor geraldo lojada ne leena kaa cese apane haath main liya
 On 14 May 1939, Lina gave birth to a healthy baby weighing around six pounds

 maano use kuch pataa hi nahin
 
 
 Don't remember leena ne khud ko bhi sambhala or apane bachche kaa bhi puraa dhyaan rakhaa
 You just think about the situation of a girl who could not choose clothes for herself, she used to wear a baby nappy
 jo khud khaane-pine ke liye apane maa-baap munh takati thi wo apane bachche ko doodh pilaati thi
 Well, time has passed and Lina has taken a job in Doctor Lozada's clinic
 doctor ne hi leena kii padhai or uske bete kii padhai kaa kharch uthaaya
 In 1972, Lina married a man named Rol Jurado and she moved to Lima with her husband

 narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad anandi ben patel ne gujarat kii satta sanbhali
 His reign first raised questions when Hardik Patel rallied against the Gujarat government on 25 August 2015
 hardik patidaaron ke liye aarakshan kii maang ko lekar ahmedabad main 5 lakh patelon ke saath ekajute hue to gujarat sarkaar ke hosh ud gaye
 The agitation turned violent and then after the intervention of the Center, the matter also calmed down, but this movement drew a new political line in the state
 yaad kiijie to jab gujarat main patidaaron kaandolan hinsak huato halaat par kaabo paane ke liye dilli se pradhanmantri narendra modi ko janata se shanti kii apil kerani padi
 But even after the appeal of PM Modi, the situation did not come under control
 iske baad hardik patel kii rashtradroh ke aarope main giraftaar ke baad halaat ko kaabo main kiya gaya
 The current situation impacted on the 2017 elections, after the movement of the party, BJP got a boost in the local elections last year in the cities, but after the way the results were seen by the Congress in the rural areas, PM Narendra Modi and the BJP central leadership was bound to increase
 
 dilli or bihar vidhansabha main mili haar se bijepi abhi tak puri tarah se ubhar bhi nahin pai he
 In such a situation, the concern of PM Narendra Modi is that the kind of political situation prevailing in Gujarat at the moment, its effect will definitely be seen in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly Election result
 om prakaash maathur ne taiyaar kii reportyahi kaaran he ki piem narendra modi ne gujarat main apane vishwaasapaatr or gujarat ke purv prabharee om prakaash maathur se gujarat kii rajnatik paristhitiyon par report taiyaar karwaai

 At this time Dinesh Sharma, incharge of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani, President of Gujarat BJP also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after which the political stir has increased in Gujarat
 om prakaash maathur ne apni report main kaha-1
 We should not ignore the movement of Patidars
 2
 There should be an end to factionalism in the state government and the party
 3
 Many major changes will have to be made in the state government
 4
 The lack of coordination between the government and the party has to be overcome as quickly as possible
 5
 The party's involvement in government decisions has to be increased
 6
 The central leadership should periodically review the functioning of the party and the government
 bataaya jaataa he ki om maathur kii is report ke baad hi piem modi or amit shah kii salaah ke baad rajya sarkaar ne sarkari naukari main agadi jatiyon ko aarakshan kaa kanoon paas kiya

 Anandi Ben Patel can be removed from the post of CM, in November this year, Anandi Ben Patel will be 75 years old
 gujarat main november 2017 main vidhansabha ke chunaav bhi hai
 In such a situation, going into the elections under the leadership of Anandi Ben Patel can make the profit less and the loss more
 charchaa is baat kii bhi he ki anandi bane patel ko haryana yaa punjab kaa governor niyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 PM Modi, sensitive to his image, also knows that if he is defeated by mistake in the Gujarat Assembly elections, his leadership will be questioned
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle yah modi ke liye itnaa bada jhatka hoga, jisase ubar paanaa unke or party donon ke liye mushkil hoga

 The bjp's unprecedented victory in Uttar Pradesh has created a furore in Bihar's grand alliance
 argedy ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh raghuvansh prasad singh ne khulkar nitish kumaar ko nishane par liya he
 Raghuvansh Prasad wants to blame Nitish Kumar for the loss of secular parties in Uttar Pradesh
 unka kahana he ki upi main secular voton kaa bikharaav nitish kumaar kii vajah se hua he
 He even said that this will also have an impact on the politics of Bihar
 raghuvansh prasad singh ko party se nikaalane kii mangarghuvansh prasad singh ke bayaan par JDU ne kadi pratikriya di he or unhen party se nikalne kii maang argedy supremeo se kii he, lekin argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav is par maun hai
 To this, Tejashwi Yadav, Deputy Chief Minister and son of Lalu Prasad Yadav said that RJD does not support Raghuvansh Prasad Singh's statement
 tejasvi ne raghuvansh prasad par sidhaa prahaar karte hue kaha ki wo party ke upaadhyaksh hai or party kii garima rakhte hue unhen aisa ochhaa bayaan nahin dena chahie
 Such statements will benefit BJP and weaken the Grand Alliance

 He can give his personal opinion, but it should not be seen from the perspective of the party
 tejasvi ne chetavanee di he ki agar is tarah kaa bayaan aage diya gaya, to party karrwai karne se bhi parhez nahin karegi
 The next time such a statement comes, strict action will be appealed to the national president

 We are saddened by the election result, but people rise only after falling
 har baar yahi kaha jaataa tha ki bihar main argedy khatm ho jaaegi, lekin RJD phir se bihar main majbootee ke saath single larguest party banakar ai he
 It is now clear that Mayawati and Akhilesh should have met in UP in the same way as the Grand Alliance was done in Bihar

 If the BJP has to stop, save the country, then everyone will have to give up their ego and become one

 When she recovered, her parents paid so much attention to her diet that within a year her weight increased so much that she came to be called 'healthy'
 maidani khelon main kabhi bhi zyada ruchi na rakhane vaali anti zyada se zyada samay 'computer games' or internet par 'chating' main bitaane lagi
 When she was brought to me as a patient, she was 10 years old and she weighed 72 kg
 aaj ke shahari bharat main yah koi akelaa maamla nahin he
 Studies conducted across the country show that 20 to 25 percent of children, especially in the urban middle and upper classes, are either overweight, or gross
 do dashak kii avadhi ke dauraan bacchon kaa ausat vajan paanch kilogram se zyada badha he, jo lok swasthya kii shabdaawalee ke anusaar kisi 'mahamari' ke tulya he
 Regarding school children in Delhi, our own study conducted from AIIMS shows that about one-fourth of the children weigh more than their recommended ideal weight
 yah nirvivaad taur par bharat main aarthik vruddhi kii pratichhaya he
 Now that food is available in abundance for the least affluent classes, and at the same time the energy spent in day-to-day activities has decreased — the change in the balance of energy is much broader
 ati gambhir antahstravi or anuvaanshik dosha (jo is varg kaa ek chota sa ansh he), badha hua calories upbhog, shaareerik sakriyata main kami, baithe-thaale kii gatividhiyon main naatakeey vruddhi (jisamen computaron par kaam karnaa or khelnaa, televijan dekhnaa shaamil he), or upbhog yogya or urja kii bachat karwaane vaali upabhokta vastuon tak sahaj pahunch ke saath saamaajik-aarthik or poshan sambandhi teevr badlaav-sabhi is samasya main yogadan dete hai
 Is the weight of the child more than just a show of sight or is there something else in it? The unfortunate truth is that significant health effects of macro physiology in childhood are yet to be accepted globally even within the medical class
 hamane dilli main 500 se zyada baari bacchon kii jaanch kii, to 10 pratishat main glucose ke chayapachay main asaamanyata thi (1 pratishat bacchon ko spasht diabetes thi), har paanch main se 2 bacchon kaa cholesterol str asaamaanya tha
 These data were again confirmed in another large study among 3,000 children - in which a similar proportion of children were found to be highly cholesterol
 ek spasht bahusankhya 'kharaab cholesterol' (ldl) ke oonche str or 'achche cholesterol' (echdiel) ke nimna str waalon kii thi
 Childhood obesity leads to adult stage obesity and all the dangers associated with it
 lekin usase bhi pehle, bachapan ke motaape kaa swasthya par usee samay prabhaav padataa he- diabetes, ooncha cholesterol, ucch raktchaap, fatty liver di
 Jeez and possibly very widespread psychological-social complications (which are difficult to measure, but they are equally serious)
 viksit deshon main kiye gaye adhyayanon main bachapan ke motaape ko skool main phiseddipane or aswasthkar yaa jokhimpurna vyavhaar, jisamen alcohol or tambaakoo kaa prayog shaamil he, se spasht taur par judaa paaya gaya he
 Obesity in childhood and adolescence triggers the process of fat deposition (atherosclerosis) in the arteries and is associated with cardiovascular deaths in adults
 dama or neend ke dauraan shwaas ukhdane jaise fefdon ke rog mote bacchon main zyada paae jate hai
 While obesity refers to high consumption of calories, many microbes — especially iron and vitamin d — are among the most common diseases in such children
 ek atirikt samasya, jo praayah bharat jaise nimna va madhyam aay varg ke deshon main dekhi jaati he, yah he ki jo bachche janm ke samay kam vajan ke hote hai, bachapan or tarunai ke dauraan unka vajan teji se badhata he
 This has now been clearly seen to be associated with diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol irregularities and other metabolic disturbances
 dakshin dilli main 40 varsh kii umr ke vyaktiyon ke samooh par aadhaarit adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki janm ke samay kam vajan se tarunai main bade vajan kii ore hone vaale badlaav ke asar kya-kya hote hai
 What is the best strategy to deal with this problem is a complicated question
 adarsh rasta yah hoga ki vajan na badhane den
 But it is easier said than done
 bachaav kai staron par karnaa hoga-vyakti, parivaar, skool or samudaay
 Although counseling the child is important, home and school initiatives are crucial
 abhibhavakon ko is baat ke liye protsaahit kiya janaa chahie ki ve bacchon ko uchit khuraaq den or unamem shaareerik sakriyata ko protsaahit karen
 And they also have to ensure that all members of the house consider this advice
 agar bachche ko yah paata he ki us par 'laadi gai' is sari 'sakhti' se ghar ke anya sadsy mukt hai, to isse koi phayda nahin hota
 Equally important is a 'hygienic' environment in the school, in which the suggested foods are brought to 'tiffin' and adequate sports facilities are available
 anti ke abhibhavak use ghaseet kar poshan visheshgyon, or vyaktigat prashikshakon tak, tairaaki se lekar aerobics classes tak le jane lage hai
 But even if the child had his own enthusiasm, it was limited
 saubhagyavash uske chayapachay kii paimaaish main koi vishesh gadabadi nahin dikhi thi
 We started a long and short-lived program of frequent conversations with doctors and nutritionists, in which the child was encouraged to express his views
 jab bacchee or uski medical team ke bich talmail or vishwaas sthapit ho gaya, to bacchee ne vajan kam karne kaa swa-prerit or swa-lahnit kaarykram shuru kar diya
 She lost weight in a year and now she is a healthy, energetic, physically skilled and a 12 year old running girl
 durbhaagya se, anya bachche utane bhaagyashaalee praayah nahin hote hai

 May 18, Sahibganj district of Jharkhand
 rajmahal vidhansabha kshetra se duusari baar chune gaye bhaajapa vidhayak arun mandal apane ghar par garmagarm chaay kii chuskiyon ke saath aaraam farma rahe the ki tabhi sibiai kii ek team ne unke ghar par chapa maaraa
 14 hidden in the mla's cupboard in search
 25 lakh ru
 The cash and some objectionable documents were found, which shows that Mandal has recently executed some real estate deals
 philhal, sibiai 30 march ko hue rajyasabha chunaav main jharkhand main voton kii kharid-farokht or paison ke len-dein ke aaropon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The Election Commission had to cancel the election due to these allegations
 ummid he ki desh kii sheersh jaanch agency agle teen maheene main chargeshit daayar kar degi
 However, Mandal is one of the 15 mlas of Jharkhand who are under the CBI probe
 unhone apane or party ke liye sharmindagi paidaa kar di he jisaki vajah he, unke ghar se bina hisaab kii nakadi or chori-chhipe kiye gaye bhoomi saudon ke saboot milanaa
 However, the BJP has not yet asked him for any explanation
 sibiai ne baaki 14 vidhayakon ke alaava jharkhand ke shram or rojgaar mantri chandraprakash choudhary ke ghar kii bhi talaashi lee he
 It is believed that such a list has been found from there, in which a huge amount is written in front of the names of the mlas
 choudhary kii safalataa kii kahani apane aap main kaaphi dilachasp he
 Chaudhary, a coal businessman in the past, contested the assembly for the first time in 2005, and since then he has always been a minister in both the UPA and NDA governments
 aktubar 2009 main iskar vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne choudhary ke nijee sahaayak manoj singh ke bank khate main 12 karod ru
 Exposed to be more than Rs
 is baramadagi ke baavjood choudhary kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin hua, kyonki iskar vibhaag or rajya satarkta beuro kii shuru kii gai jaanch pichley teen saal main kisi nattejey tak pahunchane main naakaam rahi he
 But the recent raids by the CBI can be overwhelming for this controversial minister
 radd kiye gaye chunaav kii matpeti jabt karne ke baad, sibiai ne jaahir taur par un vidhayakon ke thikaanon par chapa maaraa he, jinhone nirdaleey ummidavaar pawan kumaar dhoot ke paksh main vot diya tha
 Many mlas cast their second preference vote in favor of Dhoot, although both BJP and Congress parties had dissuaded their mlas from doing so
 mana jaataa he ki bengal ke rahane vaale vyavsaayee dhoot ko radd kiye gaye chunaav main duusare number par sabase badi sankhya main vot mili the
 This means that if Jharkhand elections were not canceled, Dhoot would have won one of the Rajya Sabha seats
 radd kiye gaye chunaav ke sambandh main sibiai ne dhoot ke nivas par or purv bhaajapa saansad ajay maaru ke ranchi nivas par bhi chaape maare hai
 In the past, for a long time many mlas of Jharkhand had made the Rajya Sabha election a means of earning big money
 2008 or 2010 main hue rajyasabha chunaavon main jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) or bhaajapa ke adhikrut ummidavaar chunaav haar gaye the or rajya ke baahar ke kaarobaari-parimal nathavani or kanvar deep singh-jharkhand se vijayi rahe the
 But the recent CBI raids have started a problem for legislators who are accustomed to 'vote on conscience' and who will now have to fight the CBI legally
 vahiin yahaan jaanch agency in vidhayakon kii amar bel kii tarah lagaataar badhati parisampattiyon ko rajyasabha chunaavon main unke vot ke saath jodne kii koshish kar rahi he
 2 by Income Tax authorities
 15 karod ru
 After the seizure, the Rajya Sabha election of 30 March was canceled
 adhikariyon ne nirdaleey kaarobaari ummidavaar, jamshedpur ke rahane vaale aar
 K
 agarwal se sambandhit car ye paise baraamad kiye
 But Dhoot has emerged as a bigger player than him, who was apparently able to get the required number of mlas in his favor
 sibiai ab yah sabit karne kii koshish kar rahi he ki kya dhoot ne unhen mili voton ke evaj main nakadi dene kii peshkash kii thi
 The special thing is that in the freshly held Rajya Sabha elections on May 3, both Agarwal and Dhoot withdrew from the election
 jin 15 vidhayakon ke thikaanon kii talaashi lee gai, ve hai, jhamumo ke polas sureen or sita sorain, ageesu ke chaar vidhayak-shram mantri chandraprakash choudhary, umakant rajak, ramchandra sahis or camel kishor bhagat, bhaajapa ke arun mandal or ramchandra baitha, sudhaa choudhary (jad-you), rajd ke sanjay singh yadav, janardan paswan or sanjay yadav tathaa congress ke sarfaraj ahamed, saurabh narayan singh or anant prasad dev
 This elaborate action by the CBI is being considered as a preparation for the legal trap of legislators
 is karrwai main nakadi, laptop or mobile phone baraamad kiye gaye hai
 The cbi's SSP R
 si
 "our investigation is moving in the right direction," says Chaudhary
 ham lagaataar tathy or saboot juta rahe hai jo aage chalakar ahm sabit honge
 Raids were conducted on the houses of a total of 15 mlas, which have yielded favorable results
 ''sibiai un dastavejon or anya sabooton kii baariki se jaanch main lagi hui he, jo 15 vidhayakon ke gharon par maare gaye chhaapon ke dauraan baraamad kiye gaye
 The CBI has also discovered that new SIM cards were bought for mobile phones on the basis of fake identities, thereby weaving the fabric of payment to the mlas
 haalanki yah saare sim card 30 march ko nasht kar die gaye the, lekin sibiai in numberon se kiye gaye colls or bheje gaye esemes kii jaankaree nikaalane main safal rahi he
 The CBI has come to know that the identity of Yaku Bali, a resident of Ranchi's mandate, was used to purchase 10 SIM cards and these SIM cards were used for money transactions to fulfill the condition of Dhoot reaching the Rajya Sabha
 For the sake of adhik vivaran hasil karne ke liye sibiai ab cellular oparator (emtis) tak pahunch gai he
 The current CBI probe includes the canceled Rajya Sabha elections of March 30, as well as the 2010 Rajya Sabha elections
 isse pehle, mukhyamantri arjuna munda ne 2010 ke rajyasabha chunaav kii sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kii thi
 At that time the President of the Alchemist Group K
 di
 Singh and Dheeraj Sahu won Rajya Sabha elections on JMM and Congress tickets respectively and BJP candidate Ajay Maru lost the election
 2010 main hue matdaan ke pehle, ek news channel ne sting oparation main congress ke teen tatkaaleen vidhayakon (savana lakada, rajesh ranjan, yogendra saav), jhamumo ke do (simon marandi or techlal mahato) or bhaajapa ke ek (uma shankar akelaa) ko rajyasabha kii do siton ke liye hue chunaav main ek vishesh ummidavaar ke paksh main vot dene ke liye 50 lakh ru
 2 crores to Rs
 or ek car kii maang karte dikhaaya tha
 Teklal Mahato has passed away
 ab sibiai kii koshishon main teji aane se us maamle kaa bhi kuch nateeja nikalne kii sambhaavna bani he, jisaki jaanch rajya nigaraanee vibhaag agast 2010 se karata aa rahaa he or jisamen chunaav ayog ke nirdesh ke baavjood abhi tak koi khaas pragati nahin ho saki he
 Looking at this whole incident, it seems that the mlas of Jharkhand, who saw the Rajya Sabha election as an opportunity to warm their pockets, are no longer well
 philhal police ke sutron kaa kahana he ki baba kii sachiv or peedita ko jo senior teacher baba ke paas lekar ai thi in donon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 Baba has also been arrested
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he

 kejariwal sarkaar ke liye is saal dilli ke bajet ko puraa kharch karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 By the end of January, if the government figures are considered, the government has not spent even half of the budget set for different projects
 badi baat yah he ki jis shiksha or swasthya ko lekar bajet main sabase bade daawey kiye gaye the, unamem bhi aadhe se kam bajet kharch kiya gaya he
 The government has only two months left to spend
 kendriya madad kam hone se naarazgidelli ke logon ke man menyah sawaal ubhar rahaa he ki is sarkaar main kaam ho bhi rahaa he yaa nahin? kejariwal sarkaar ke paas vittiya saal khatm hone ke mahaj kuch dinon pehle tak lagbhag aadha bajet padaa hua he
 With these questions from Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia, the exercise of preparing the next budget has started
 kejariwal sarkaar centre par bajet main dilli ko paisa nahin dene kii vajah se naaraaz he
 Sisodia has said that the step-motherly behavior of the Center is affecting the development of Delhi
 shiksha or swasthya main vaade bade, kaam kam31 janvari tak ke aankadon ke mutabikdilli sarkaatpane hi bajet kaa aadha hissaa hi kharch kar pai he
 47% of expenditure has been incurred on education chikitsa yani medical par to haalat or buree he
 Up to two months before the end of the financial year, only 41 percent of the budget has been spent
 kisi vibhaag main lakshya puraa nahinkai vibhaagon main to kharch kaa hisaab kitaab or bhi dhilaa he
 The Energy Department has only 0 of its budget till January
 18 fisadi kharch kiya he
 The tourism department has spent about 6 percent and the food supply department has also spent only 6 percent
 vahiin samaaj kalyaan or peedblyoody vibhaag ne pehle 10 maheene main 70 fisadi se adhik kharch kar liya he
 Now that the government has not been able to spend the budget, then obviously the anti-party parties will be targeting
 dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne isaki shuruyaat kar di he
 Delhi government's revenue in the next budget will also be lower than expected this year
 iske alaava emsidi ko fund dena rahaa ho yaa phir bijli or pani par sabsidi kaa kharch, project kii bajaae revadiyaan baantne par bajet zyada lagaaya gaya he
 Therefore, in the coming budget, there will be challenges for the Kejriwal government whether there are plans for priority development or to directly benefit the people
 pruthak vidarbha ke mudde par shivasena ke hamalon ke jawaab main aaj maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne apni sahyogi party shivasena se kaha ki vah ‘akhand maharashtra’ ke mukhyamantri hai

 fadanvis ne kaha, ‘‘ab tak rajya sarkaar ke samaksh pruthak vidarbha kaa koi maamla saamne nahin aayaa he

 If that phase is left, Uri has been almost completely free from crisis for the last few years

 In the midst of what the army called "assigning and handling", the terrorists found little window of weakness or fragile opportunity to attack

 "they point out that despite the best efforts possible, the movement of troops in the adjoining areas of the loc in Kashmir or keeping the information of army camps and encampments confidential is impossible

 is dauraan satta paksh samet vipakshi dalon ke saansadon ne apni raay vyakt kii or is dauraan garmagaram bahes bhi dekhne ko mili
 During the discussion, when Union Minister Smriti Irani, while voicing her views, referred to Islamic history and citing some sentences from the time of Prophet Mohammad, termed the triple talaq as a great evil in the society, during this time suddenly her attitude became tough and she Warned a member to listen to Hanuman Chalisa
 teen talaak par minakshi lekhi, mukhtaar abbaas nakvi or mohammad saleem jaise saansadon ke baad kendriya mantri smriti irani ko apni baat rakhane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Irani said in the beginning of his talk that the 1986 law was called for in the House which says that according to the law, the maintenance allowance will be given only till the time of Idtat
 irani ne iske liye congress kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki jab congress ke paas mauka tha tab unki sarkaar muslim mahilaon ke samarthan main khadi nahin huin
 Criticizing Smriti Irani's persecution of Smriti Irani, Smriti Irani cited Islamic history and said that for the first time such a case came in front of another caliph when a person was asked if you had given such a divorce, he accepted and He was sentenced to 40 whips

 On this, Smriti Irani's attitude changed and she said, 'if i want to hear the name of Hazrat Saheb from me, then i too would like to hear Hanuman Chalisa with your mouth, if you ever dare, will listen
 'iske aage unhone teen talaak kanoon ke apradheekaran kaa virodh karne waalon par bhi tippanee kii
 Smriti said that dowry and sati practice has also been made illegal and those who say that marriage is just a contract in Muslim society, such people should understand that if the contract is canceled then they too are canceled on equal terms
