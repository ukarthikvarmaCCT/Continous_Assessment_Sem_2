 Now only 8 days are left for the notification of voting for the first phase of UP elections
 bahujan samaaj party ne duusare dalon ko peeche chhodte hue takreeban sabhi siton par apane pratyaashee ghoshit kar die hai
 When BSP supremo Mayawati brought a historic mandate in the 2007 elections, her social engineering was considered to be a big reason behind it
 khaas baat ye he ki mayawati ne is baar bhi apni is 'ejineering' par puraa focus kiya he
 This is the reason why this party, doing politics by keeping Dalits at the center, has given the highest number of tickets to upper caste candidates
 dalitupi main daliton kii aabaadi 21-22 fisadi he
 The Jatavs are the highest at 14%
 inke voton par mayawati kii acchhee pakad maani jaati he
 The remaining 12 to 14 percent Dalit castes include Khatik, Paswan, Kori, Khairwar, Dhobi, Valmiki etc
 mayawati ne apane kul 403 main se 87 tikat dalit ummidavaaron ko die hai
 That is, Mayawati has given more than 21 per cent of her tickets to the community which has almost such a share in up's population
 muslim2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik upi main hinduon kii jansankhya 79
 73 per cent (about 16 crores) while Muslims here 19
 26 fisadi (3
 84 crores)
 mayawati ne is baar pehle se zyada 97 muslim ummidavaar maidan main utaare hai jo ki uske kul ummidavaaron kaa takreeban 25 fisadi baithta he
 The upper castes constitute 18-20 percent of the population in Savarnaupi
 isamen 8-9 fisadi brahman, 4-9 fisadi rajput, 3-4 fisadi vaisya or baaki tyaagi, bhoomihaar or anya hai
 Mayawati has given 113 tickets to upper castes, which is 28 per cent of her total candidates
 saaf he ki mayawati in chunaavon main apane kor voter ke prati aashwast hokar dusron ke vot bank main send lagane kii taiyaari main he
 OBCUP has 42-45% population of backward castes
 inamen yadav sabase adhik 10 fisadi, lodhi 3-4%, kurmi 4-5%, maury 4-5% va anya 21% hai
 Mayawati has fielded 106 candidates this time
 yani unke takreeban 26 fisadi ummidavaar anya pichhadaa varg se hai
 If seen from the perspective of the population, then Mayawati seems to be lagging a bit here
 isaki ek vajah ye ho sakati he ki rajya kii sattarudh samaajawaadee party is varg ke votaron kaa sabase bada hissaa batorti rahi he or maaya ne fail ho jane ke dar se yahaan apana daanv nahin khelaa ho
 Amid speculation about Narendra Modi being declared the Prime Ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party, party president Rajnath Singh did not say anything on the issue but praised the Chief Minister of Gujarat as 'the country's most popular leader' Of course

 It is worth noting that JDU is raising objections against Modi
 narendra modi kaa virodh nitish kumaar kii raajnneetik majaburi!bijepi pramukh is baat par kaayam rahe ki party ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bhaajapa sansadeey board tay karegaa
 He also said, 'the board will decide what standards should be adopted for deciding the post of Prime Minister
 ’PM daavedaari: nitish ko 'NO', modi par suspencemodi kii ore ishaara karte hue shanivaar jadyu kaaryakarini kii baithak main ek party netaa ne kaha tha, ‘lokapriy hona alag baat he or pradhanmantri bananaa alag
 Singh said that he is confident that whatever decision the bjp's parliamentary board makes will not create any crisis
 main is baat ko bharose se kah saktaa hum
 However, the BJP chief evaded an answer to the question whether he was suggesting that Modi's name should not be projected as the prime ministerial candidate

 party pravaktaa satyavrath chaturvedi ne aakhirkaar umr se puch hi liya ki jab wo kashmir se baahar nikle hi nahin to modi lahar ko kaise dekh liya
 In fact, ever since Omar has given a statement related to the Modi wave, the Congress party is stinging this inside
 haalanki na to sonia gandhi or na hi rahul gandhi ne is ore koi tippanee kii he, lekin patna main ek kaarykram ke dauraan satyavrath chaturvedi ne umr abdulla se poocha ki aakhir jab unhone desh ghumaa nahin or kashmir se baahar nahin nikle to srinagar main baithe-baithe unhen modi kii lahar kahaan dikh gai

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se thik pehle teen rajyon main congress kii sarkaar ban gai he
 The major reason for the victory of Congress in these elections is believed to be the promise of loan waiver from the farmers
 is jeet ke baad ek baar phir kai rajya kisaanon kii karj-maafee kaa elaan kar rahe hai taaki aam chunaavon main kisaan kii naaraazgi vot na kaat le
 Whether or not votes will be saved from the announcement of debt waiver, they will tell the results of the general election, but it is certain that the race for debt waiver will definitely cut the pockets of the common tax payers
 karj maafee se yun kam ho rahi jidipidansal 2017 se desh main jari kisaan karj maafee ke raajnneetik daanv se zyaadaatar rajyon kaa khajaana dabaav jhel rahaa he
 Beginning to waive the peasant debt, the Maharashtra government incurred a loss of Rs 34,000 crore and the state's GDP of 1
 3 fisadi kam ho gai
 After this, the Yogi government formed in Uttar Pradesh waived debt of Rs 36,000 crore and the state's GDP 2
 7 fisadi kii chot pahunchi
 Then Punjab waived 10,000 crore rupees and Rajasthan 8000 crore farmer loans in February 2008 and 2 in the GDP of the states
 1 fisadi or 0
 There was a loss of 9 percent
 india today ke sampadak anshuman tiwari ke mutabik in sabhi karj maafee ko milakar is dauraan kul 1 lakh 72 hajaar 146 karod rupee kii karj maafee kaa elaan kiya ja chukaa he
 The debt of farmers should not be merged with the amnesty, who are not unnecessarily worried, whose debt was forgiven? Announced a nationwide debt waiver of Rs
 Crore
 lekin is elaan ke baad agle chaar saal ke dauraan kendra sarkaar 52,000 karod rupee kaa karj maaf kar pai or vaade ke mutabik 18,000 karod rupee kaa karj bakaayaa rah gaya
 Similarly, the new Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka announced a loan waiver of Rs 8,000 crore, but so far only Rs 400 crore loan has been waived
 lihaaja, sawaal khadaa hota he ki jab kendra yaa rajya sarkarein kisaan karj ko maaf karne kaa elaan karti hai to kyon puraa karj chukaa nahin diya jaataa
 After all, the debt of which farmers is left whose money does not get from the government treasury? Rahul Srivastava says that it is also clear that the benefits of such electoral promises do not reach the farmers
 karjamaafee se jaruri nahin chunavi phydanshuman tiwari kehete hai ki is baat kii koi guarantee nahin ki chunaav se pehle kisaan karj maafee kaa elaan karne se jeet tay kii ja sakati he
 In Karnataka, the Congress government announced the debt waiver, but it did not have any direct impact on the election results
 vahiin rajasthan main vasundhara raaje kii sarkaar ne chunaavon se pehle 8,000 karod kii karj maafee kaa elaan kiya or vah satta se baahar baithi he
 Inflation is returning, the economic front is coming with challenges
 The year 2019, Anshuman Tiwari said that since 2017, till now, political waiver of debt waiver has gone in seven states
 punjab or maharashtra main june 2017, uttar pradesh main april 2017, rajasthan main farvari 2018, karnataka main july 2018, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main disambar 2018 main ye hua
 Farmer loan waiver data: The Reserve Bank data shows how much need is there for farmer loan waiver in the country
 aankadon ke mutabik jahaan madhya pradesh main kul karj kaa 29 fisadi or rajasthan main 35 fisadi krishi kshetra main karj he
 In Madhya Pradesh, the debt in agriculture is 11 percent
 is karj ko maaf karne ke liye rajya sarkaar elaan kar rahi he lekin is karj kaa kitna hissaa kendra or kitna rajya sarkaar degi yah abhi tay nahin he
 Anshuman Tiwari said that due to this, the government of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra had to withdraw the entire amount of loan waiver from their budget
 is rakam ke liye uttar pradesh ko vikaas ke kaam ko ek-tihaai kam karnaa padaa vahiin maharashtra sarkaar ko apana kharch nikaalane ke liye shiridy ke mandir se kam dar par karj lenaa padaa
 It is obvious that this waiver of debt waiver should not get the political parties to vote
 a common tax payer will have to pay for it as it is the priority of the governments to get the votes after the priority of meeting their expenditure and in the meantime the pace of development will be controlled

 madhya pradesh ke neemuch main haal main hua ghatnakram bollywood kii sansanikhej filmi kahani se kam nahin he
 There is suspense, drama, crime, corrupt policemen and honest officers
 yah kahani dedh saal pehle sadak durghatana main maare gaye ek vyakti se shuru hoti he, jiske paas se mili pahchaan-patr ke aadhaar par uski shinaakht nashile padaarthon ke kukhyat taskar 36 varshiya ghanashyam dhakad ke rup main hoti he
 The police later learn that the raid is alive and smuggling
 isse bhi bada khulaasa us vakt hota he jab vah police kii giraft main aata he
 It is revealed that this is just a trailer, the whole film is still pending
 giraftaar dhakad bataata he ki police record main mrit sabit ho janaa taskari kaa sabase surakshit tarika he or yah tarkeeb use ek anya taskar bansi gurjar ne bataai thi, jo police dastavejon main kathith rup se muthbhed main maaraa ja chukaa tha
 The mandsaur-neemuch region, known for its opium cultivation across the country, is also notorious for its smuggling
 is ghatana kii vajah bhi taskari hi thi
 The business of smuggling continued smoothly, so Ghanshyam killed a person and put his identity card and mobile in his pocket and badly mutilated the body of the body so that it could not be identified
 ghanashyam ke parijanon ne bhi laash kii pahchaan ghanashyam ke rup main kii
 Thus he was declared dead in the police files and all the cases against him were closed
 ujjain range ke iji upendra jain bataate hai, ‘‘dhakad 2008 main 50 kilo opium kii taskari ke maamle main giraftaar hua tha, do saal baad 2010 main vah jamaanat par reeha hua or faraar ho gaya
 In March 2011, he planned to prove himself dead
 isamen uske ghar vaale bhi shaamil the
 The role of policemen in this case is also questionable
 dhakad par maamle pehle se darj the yani police record main uskaa photo, pahchaan ke anya chinh hone chahie
 In such a situation, how did the police believe Ghanshyam's family? IG Jain says, "the then station in-charge Ravindra Boyat, Investigating Officer Assistant Sub Inspector M
 aar
 Garg and Havildar Umesh Chauhan have been suspended
 is maamle main yaa to unki mileebhagat he yaa laaparvaahee he
 Sources reveal that Ghanshyam's mobile call details may expose the policemen who participated in this conspiracy
 ab police yah pataa lagane main juty he ki vah laash, jise ghanashyam kii maan liya gaya tha, aakhir kiski thi
 Police were also surprised by the revelations made by Ghanshyam during the interrogation
 balki ek baar phir police kii kaaryastylee kathghare main aa gai
 Ghanshyam said that the plot is the brainchild of the notorious smuggler Bansi Gurjar and his partner Pappu Gurjar
 isse bhi bada khulaasa yah hua ki bansi gurjar, jise farvari 2009 main kathith taur par muthbhed main maar giraaya gaya tha, vah bhi darasal jinda he
 Now the new question was that if Gurjar is alive then who was the person killed in the encounter and how did the police identify him as Bansi Gurjar? "on the day of the encounter, the police received information from the informer that Bansi was going to pass by," says Satish Saxena, DIG, Ratlam Range
 ek vyakti vahaan aayaa or muthbhed main maaraa gaya
 After this, Bansi's family came and identified him as Bansi
 ’’ neemuch ke police adheekshak ramashray choube kehete hai, ‘‘parivaar waalon ne use pahchaan liya tha to shaq kaa sawaal hi nahin uthaa
 "apart from Ghanshyam, the police has come to know about Bansi being alive
 police ke haath lagi ek video clip main bansi saathiyon ke saath dikh rahaa he
 Saxena says, "it is clear from the evidence so far that Bansi Gurjar is alive
" ’’ab tatkaaleen police adhikari is farji muthbhed se pallaa jhaad rahe hai
 Ved Prakash Sharma, the then Superintendent of Police of Neemuch and currently the IG of Shahdol Range, says, "in my tenure, the person killed in a police encounter was identified as Bansi Gurjar
 uske parijanon ne uski pahchaan kii thi
 The police station in-charge also described him as Bansi Gurjar on the basis of facts related to Gurjar present in the police records
 ’’police adhikariyon kii jimmedaari tay karne ke sawaal par diiji saxena kehete hai, ‘‘jab tak bansi gurjar nahin mil jaataa, uskaa diene test nahin ho jaataa tab tak kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 "now finding Bansi is a big challenge for the police
 choube kehete hai ‘‘sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik bansi behad kaa laabh uthaa rahaa he
 Apart from opium smuggling, Bansi also had serious cases of robbery and extortion against him and it is said that he was in awe in Rampura and Manasa areas of Neemuch district
 is kahani kaa asli khalanaayak opium or uski taskari he
 The Narcotics Control Bureau has granted around 61,000 licenses for opium cultivation in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, of which over 27,000 are from Madhya Pradesh where opium is grown on more than 13,000 hectares
 pradesh kaa 99 fisadi opium utpaadak kshetra mandsaur-neemuch main he isiilie is ilaake main taskari ke maamle bhi zyada hote hai
 On 29 June this year, Narcotics Control Bureau detained 7 people and seized 65 kg of opium from a village in Ratangarh tehsil of Neemuch
 isse pehle 26 farvari ko neemuch jile se hi 14 kilo 500 gram opium baraamad kii gai thi
 On March 4, 9 kg 50 grams of opium was seized from Neemuch, while on March 9, about 1 kg 800 grams of heroin was seized near Mandsaur
 desh main salanaa ausatan 700 ton opium kaa utpaadan hota he, jiskaa lagbhag 400 ton isi kshetra se miltaa he
 That is why mandsaur-neemuch of Madhya Pradesh has an important place in the legitimate poppy producing regions of the country
 yahaan kaa ek kisaan bataata he, ‘‘taskari kaa opium aise kisaanon se milti he jo license lene ke baad utpaadan to karte hai lekin yaa to use darshaate nahin hai yaa bahut kam darshaate hai
 However, the police have started a conspiracy of the conspirators
 ghanashyam ke bayaan or video clip main maujuudagi ke aadhaar par sharaab vyavsaayee pappu gurjar ko giraftaar kar liya he or shav kii pahchaan ghanashyam ke rup main karne vaale uske pita sahit anya parijanon ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The country's capital has once again become ashamed
 shuukravaar raat 18 saal kii ek ladki ke saath uske do doston ne kathith taur par gangrape kiya, aropiyon main ek naaballig he
 One of the accused was identified as Rahul (20) and the minor accused is 17 years old
 in donon ko police ne shanivaar subah giraftaar kar liya
 a senior police officer said after registering a complaint on behalf of the victim, 'yesterday (friday) was the girl's 18th birthday
 donon ladke use janmdin manaane kaa laalach dekar apane kamare main le gaye or uskaa gangrape kiya
 'both the victim and the accused are residents of Jalpaiguri in West Bengal and they know each other beforehand
 ladki ko chikitsa jaanch ke liye bheja gaya he
 The officer said that both the accused have been apprehended and further investigation is on

 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ko aaj kii raat bhi ranchi ke birsa munda jail main hi gujaarna padegaa
 Lalu Prasad Yadav went back to Ranchi on Monday after being released on parole from 11 to 13 May and surrendered in jail
 iske baad is baat ko lekar ummid jataai ja rahi thi ki lalu ko 6 hafton ke liye medical ground par jo jamaanat mili he, isaki nyaayik prakriya puri hone ke baad vah mangalvaar ko jail se reeha ho sakate the, magar aisa nahin ho paaya
 In fact, the copy of the order of Lalu Prasad Yadav, who got bail on the medical ground from Jharkhand High Court on May 11, could not reach the court even today
 lalu kii jamaanat kii nyaayik prakriya ko puri karne ke liye aaj subah se hi unke kareebi vidhayak bholaa yadav or jharkhand argedy ke pradesh adhyaksh annapurna devi sibiai court main deraa jamaa kar baithe hue the, magar jab hai court se jamaanat ke aadesh kii copy sibiai court nahin pahunchi to unhen bairang waapas lautnaa padaa
 This clearly means that Laloo Prasad Yadav will have to spend Tuesday night in Hotwar Jail in Ranchi
 yani parole kii avadhi samaapt hone ke baad lalu ko somvaar kii raat jail main hi rahe or ab mangalvaar kii raat bhi unhen jail main hi bitaani padegi
 It is now expected that a copy of Lalu's bail order will be sent to the CBI court from the Jharkhand High Court on Wednesday, after which the judicial process will be completed and Lalu will be released from jail by Wednesday evening
 lalu ke jamaanat kii nyaayik prakriya puri karne ke liye unhen 50-50 hajaar rupee kaa bel band bhi bharna padegaa
 As part of the judicial process, after the bail bond is filled, an order will be issued from the CBI court to release Lalu on bail and then a copy of that order will be handed over to the jail administration after which Lalu will be able to come out of the jail

 There is a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh and at the center, the BJP called Ram
 uttar pradesh main party ke kai netaa bhi ab puure soobe main ‘ram raaj’ jaisaa vakt laut aane kaa daawa karte nahin thakte
 But in this 'ram Raj' the voice of 'ram' itself is not being heard
 beete teen din se meerut main ‘ram’ hi nahin ‘sita’, ‘hanuman’, ‘lakshmana’, ‘bharat’, ‘shatrughna’ ke kehane par bhi yahaan ke saansad, vidhayak, adhikari kaan nahin dhar rahe the
 Finally, 'ram' had to come down on the field on Monday with a broom in his own hand
 ‘lakshmana’ or ‘hanuman’ samet anya paatro ne bhi fawda lekar morcha sambhala
 Let us not confuse you further, let us tell you what the whole matter is
 darasal, meerut ke gymkhana ground main varshon se har saal ramlila kaa aayojan hota aayaa he
 People come from far away to see this Ramlila
 is saal bhi ramlila ke bhavy str par aayojan ke liye gymkhana ground main lambey samay se taiyaari kii ja rahi thi
 But the rains that occurred in the last three days turned the entire ground into a pond
 kisi tarah pani sookhaa bhi to puure ground main keechad hi keechad najar aane laga
 For this reason, Ramlila has not been staged here for the last three days
 ramlila ke aayojakon or kalakaaron kaa kahana he ki wo ground kii safai ke liye adhikariyon, saansad, vidhayak har kisi se guhaar laga chuke hai lekin kisi ne sud nahin lee
 When disappointment was received from every side for the cleaning of the ground, the organizers and artists of Ramlila themselves started to clean the ground by taking a front
 ram kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale kalakaar khud haath main jhaadu lekarsafai kartedikhe
 At the same time, the actors playing the characters of Hanuman and Laxman were seen cleaning the ground by lifting mud with a shovel
 is maukey par sabhi kalakaar ramlila kii paaramparik veshbhusha main najar aae
 In the past, the organizers were forced to move the place of Ramlila from the Gymkhana Ground to the nearby Dharamshala
 lekin vahaan jagah bahut kam hone kii vajah se kam hi log ramlila dekhne ke liye aa pate hai
 The artists and organizers of the Ramlila Committee say that Ramlila experiences a different enthusiasm and reverence when a ground like Gymkhana is filled with audience
 logon kii samasyaon par dhyaan nahin dene ke liye netaa or adhikari aaropon ke katghare main aate rahete hai
 But even after pleading for several times to Gymkhana Ground, the organizers are telling the subject related to the faith of the people

 The Islamabad High Court on Monday suspended the order to detain Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the main accused in the 26 / 11 terror attack plot in Mumbai
 'jeeyo news' ke anusaar, yah aadesh somvaar ko nyaayamurti nur-al-haq kuraishi ne diya
 Lakhvi was granted bail on 18 December by Judge Syed Kausar Abbas Zaidi of Pakistan's anti-terrorism Court
 lekin use 19 disambar ko ek baar phir vyavastha banaae rakhane se sambandhit dhara ke tahat giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 He was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan in February 2009 on the statement of Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist caught alive in the Mumbai attack

 Earlier, after the appeal, Lakhvi's lawyer Rizwan Abbasi said, "today Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi has filed a petition in Islamabad High Court challenging the custody under MPO
 ' unhone kaha, 'lakhvi kii hiraasat ke maamle main kanoonee jaruraton ko puraa nahin kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the legal grounds cited by the government in this case are not sustainable
 ' Islamabad-based anti-terrorism court judge Kausar Abbas Zaidi granted bail to Lakhvi citing lack of evidence in the Mumbai attack case on December 18
 iske baad sarkaar ne empio ke tahat lakhvi ko teen maheene ke liye hiraasat main liya
 Lakhvi filed an application before the Government of Pakistan on Wednesday demanding the termination of his detention under the MPO
 yah puche jane par ki jab upree adaalatein do saptaah ke sheetakaaleen avkaash ke taur par aath janvari tak band hai, to lakhvi ne kaise islamabad hoicourt main yachika daayar kii to uske vakil ne kaha, 'hiraasat tatkaal sthiti kaa maamla he or adaalatein chhuttiyon ke dauraan bhi aise maamalon par gaur karti hai
 ' udhar, sarkaar lakhvi kii jamaanat ko chunauti dene main naakaam rahi he
 The government says that the judge has not issued a copy of the order
 ullekhneey he ki lakhvi ko jamaanat ke faisle ko lekar bharat ne aalochana kii thi or is par bahut saare logon ko hairaani hui ki yah aadesh us vakt aayaa jab iske kuch din pehle hi peshawar ke sainik skool main taliban ke hamale main 148 log maare gaye the, jinamein adhikansh bachche the
 Apart from Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hammad Amin Sadiq, Shaheed Jamil Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younus Anjum have been named accused in the Mumbai attack case

 aise hi hiraasat main rahane vaale ek kashmiri netaa ne aaj tak ke camere par pehali baar kashmir ko lekar apni baat rakhi
 CPI (M) leader Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, who was an MLA from Kulgam in Kashmir, dismissed all the government's claims about Kashmir in an exclusive discussion till date
 bataa den, mohammad yusuf tarigami ko ilaaj karwaane ke liye srinagar se dilli aane ke liye supreme court se anumati mili or ab tarigami waapas kashmir jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Mohammed Yusuf Tarigami, who was on camera for the first time till date, said, 'I thank the Supreme Court, which allowed me to come to Delhi for treatment and Kashmir is my home, so i will go back to my house soon
 'tarigami ko yah nahin pataa ki srinagar airport par utarate hi unhen phir se castady main le liya jayega yaa unhen duusare ilaakon main jane kii anumati milegi
 On this question till date, Taragami said, 'I will be taken again in custody or not, i will see if the whole state is in custody, the rest will go there
 'mangalvaar ko purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha samet unke saath gaye kai logon ko srinagar airport se waapas dilli bhej diya gaya

 aaj haal yah he ki hamen bataaya bhi nahin jaataa ki ham giraftaar hai, ghar main band hai lekin hamaara kasoor kya he
 On the question of arresting Farooq Abdullah under PSA from the Jammu and Kashmir government, Tariagami said that now everyone has been arrested, even those who have been Chief Ministers, mlas and Ministers
 jin par hamale hue, jinke rishtedaaron ko maaraa gaya, un sab ko jail main band kar diya gaya he
 Tarigami said that it is so sad that the law that was made against smugglers, today the same law has been applied to leaders like Farooq Abdullah
 yah bataa rahaa he ki kashmir main haalat kya he or kashmir main kya ho rahaa he
 Questioning the recent statement given by Prime Minister Modi on Article 370, Yusuf Tariagami said that 370 was part of the Constitution of India which was given by the framers of the Constitution, so is their intention being doubted? When Article 370 was given for Kashmir in the Constitution, there was Sardar Patel in the government and also Nehru
 inke saath bahut saare or netaa bhi the lekin pradhanmantri kah rahe hai ki sardaar patel kaa sapana aaj puraa hua
 The CPI (M) leader's question is whether Sardar Patel's dream is fulfilled today or was Sardar Patel's dream that the constitution should remain and the 370 that was in the same constitution be retained? He said that i request the Prime Minister to put the facts of history properly in front of the country

 Today there is an outcry of birds and an empire of greenery

 logon ne unhen drip se sinchai kii bhi salaah di lekin ve is baat ko bakhubi samajhate the ki 5 se 8 varg kilometre main drip sinchai karne ke liye unke paas paryaapt paisa nahin he
 Meanwhile, one day, he was setting aside the empty cans of mineral water that he felt that if he used these empty cans in irrigation, then the matter would be settled

 The system of irrigation of canes by cutting

 Doing this does not cost too much water and gets proper irrigation
 ve is tarah kam pani ke kharch par bhi lambey samay takpedo kii sinchaikarte rahete hai
 Slowly the campaign started to bring color
 
 
 unka jaadu dhire-dhire hi sahi magar asar karne laga
 Now there was greenery all around

 Earlier, the animals and birds living here had escaped from these plaintiffs
 ve ab phir se unhen waapas liva laae hai

 On 19 June 2017, veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manoj Tiwari inaugurated it with local councilor Urmila Rana
 dilli se saansad manoj tiwari ne tab kaha tha 'aam aadmi party (aap) ne puri dilli se free wifai kaa vaada kiya tha, par 'aap' shaayad vaada karke bhul gai, lekin ab kam se kam 'kadipur' main 24 ghante wifai rahegaa

 Parliamentary Meenakshi Lekhi says" The traders also know that the problem of sealing has arisen not in the BJP era but the Congress
 hamane supreme court main iske khilaaf affidefit daakhil kiya he
 Today Ajay Maken is saying that if his party wins, he will stop the sealing within a month
 lekin yah samasya 2008 main maakan ke shahari vikaas mantri rahete hue hi paidaa hui thi
 Congress candidate Ajay Maken says, "people could not recover from demonetisation and GST now that traders got trapped in the ceiling of sealing in Delhi

 vajah yah he ki vamapanthiyon ko aakhirkaar ek aisa netaa mil gaya he jo tiemasi or uski supremeo mamata banerjee ke “inch dar inch” badla lene kii lalkaar kaa muqabla karne ke liye taiyaar he
 "I tell them (to Mamata) that by the time you measure inch by inch, this jot (mass alliance) must have gone too far
 ” yah baat sooryakanth mishra bahut bharose ke saath kehete hai or 10,000 kii bheed main khushi kaa kolahal foot padataa he
 By making the infamous remark of revenge "inch by inch" from her opponents, Mamata had already won the resentment of the Election Commission, here too, there have been fierce reactions
 is sabaki vajah beshak doctor babu hai
 Suryakant Mishra is fondly called by this name (he is a physician)
 unhone sipiem ko nai jindagi bakshi he, jo 2011 main chunavi haar ke baad se hi lagbhag coma main thi
 This is what the future chief minister-leftist jot-sangi (coalition partner) Congress tells them - their white Mahindra Boleros come out of the car and the ocean of red ends surrounds them
 unke kareeb aane ke liye log bans kii baaden tak laangh jate hai
 Also, the flash lights of selfie sticks and mobile phones sparkle like small wires
 is sabha ke liye mishra mahaj ek payalat car ke saath khamoshi se ghante bhar se zyada kaa safar tay karke aae hai
 This propaganda campaign without much fanfare says a lot about a relaxed and self-conscious leader
 ve vaise bhi apane 39 saal lambey rajnatik kariyar main kabhi oonchi aawaaj main bolne ke liye nahin jane gaye, tab bhi nahin jab unke saath ke bhadkile or lokapriy netaa manch par par aag-si laga dete the
 His friend and CPM leader from West Midnapore, Anil Patra, says, “I remember when he was practicing medicine in Midnapore
 ve puraani motorcycle par marijon ko dekhne jaaya karte the
 Although they could buy a car, they hated the chaos
 unki practice acchhee chalati thi, jabaki zyaadaatar marijon kaa ve muft ilaaj karte the
 i have seen a large number of people waiting for consultation with Doctor Babu
 ”mishra 1970 ke dashak ke aakhri varshon main raajnneeti main aae the
 In those days this leader of SFI was heard by party veteran Biman Bose while giving a speech at a meeting in Midnapore
 sipiem ke ek netaa kehete hai, “bimanda itane prabhavit hue ki ve chaahate the surya puri tarah siyasat main aa jaaen
 In the 1980s, he became the Chairman of the District Council of Midnapore and held this post for 12 years
 uske baad ve kolkata aa gaye
 Bimanada's hand was always on his shoulders
 jis din surya ne unki jagah lee or rajya sachiv bane, us din sabase zyada khush bimanda hi the
 Mishra is considered a fundamentalist
 shuruyaat main party main unhen jan netaa ke taur par manyata nahin mili
 The same CPM leader states, "he was a member of the team that voted against the formation of the Left Front-backed Congress-led government in 1996 against Prime Minister Jyoti Basu (which Basu himself called a" historic mistake ")
 phir karaat or duusare kattarpathiyon kii tarah surya babu bhi un logon main the jo sochate the ki 2008 main america ke saath parmaanu qaraar ke mudde par upie-1 se samarthan waapas lenaa sahi tha
 However, this decision later proved to be a political mistake of the party in Bengal, when it gave TMC a chance to establish a foothold
 ”phir to yah swaabhaavik hi tha ki jab sipiem ke purv mukhyamantri buddhadev bhattacharya ne surya ko tarakkee dekar na keval apane mantrimandal main cabinet mantri banaaya or panchayat, gramin vikaas or swasthya jaise aalaa mahakamon kii jimmedaari saunpi, balki sadan main unhen “party kii puunji” bataate hue unke kaside bhi padhe, to kuch commered dabi jubaan khinse nipore rahe the
 In the 2011 assembly elections, there was a void in leadership in the assembly with the defeat of heavyweights like Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, Aseem Dasgupta, Nirupam Sen and Mohammad Salim, then Mishra was brought in the front row
 duusare bade netaaon kii gairmaujuudagi kii vajah se ve vipaksh ke netaa bane to unki party ke logon ko hi shaq tha ki saumy or kam bolne vaale surya sattapaksh kii bhadakaau raajnneeti kaa muqabla kar paaenge yaa nahin
 But Mishra molded himself according to this role, besieged the government on specific issues and took Mamata in the slightest
 unhone adatan sadan se gaiyrhaazir rahane vaali mukhyamantri ko majaboor kar diya ki ve satron ke dauraan kam se kam un dinon to vidhansabha main aaen hi jab unhen vipaksh ke sawaalon ke jawaab dene hote hai
 Around 2013, Left Front President Biman Bose expressed his desire to retire from the post of Secretary of State for CPM due to his age when in March 2015, Mishra became the unanimous candidate for the party's top position in the state
 vam morche ke adhyaksh bimaan bose ne 14 march 2015 ko kaha tha ki “palak jhapakate hi unke naam par faisla kar liya gaya,” jo is baat kii taraf ishaara tha ki kis tarah puri party unke saath thi
 From radical to moderate, the Sun kept shielding and forming itself
 party sachiv ke naate ve sadakon par nikle, logon se mili or kader ke saath khadey hue
 Along with the cadre who was falling prey to the excesses of the ruling party
 party kii kendriya samiti ke ek sadsy kehete hai, “communist siddhantvaadi hone ke baavjood unhone mahasoos kiya ki janata ke vyapak hit ke liye lacheela rukh apnaane or vyaavhaarik jindagi ke takaajon ko maanane main koi harj nahin he
 Incidentally, in 2016, when the radicals in the CPM and the South Indian lobby refused to consider a possible left-congress alliance to counter the "chaotic TMC", it was Surya who pledged to come with both parties - Not just because it was a political compulsion or a fight to save existence in Bengal, but also for the sake of thousands of cadres who were constantly being driven out, false cases Imposed and fines were flexing
 unhone kendriya samiti or paulitte-beuro main daleel di ki is vakt logon ke saath khadey na hone or gathbandhan kii unki maang kii kadra na karne kaa arth khudakushi karne jaisaa hoga
 Surya said in the meetings, "we have lost 175 comrades
 2,000 se zyada hameshaa ke liye apahiz ho chuke hai or hajaaron jhuthe siyaasi aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 The sky is the limit
 ab unase sidhe takaraane kaa vakt aa chukaa he
 "despite it being in the majority, the Kerala unit conceded defeat," says a member of the Politburo
 ”gathbandhan ke shilpakaarpanch dashak puraane dushmano se haath milaane par mishra ne kaha tha, “mamata kii hukumat itani buree he ki janata kaa vishaal gathbandhan bananaa padaa
 Nobody wants to be with them, even their own people are leaving them
 unki sabase badi uplabdhi yahi he
 When the doctor says this, there is a laughter in the audience
 phir tajjub kya ki mamata ne unke grihnagar narayangarh, jahaan se ve chunaav lard rahe hai, ke matadaataaon se unki haar pakki karne kii purajor guzarish kii he
 The TMC chief said in his publicity meeting here, "if you beat the sun, i will give whatever you want
 agar main dobaaraa mukhyamantri banati hum to apni jeet kii raily kii shuruyaat yaheen se karuungi
 i will be your guest and will eat special dalare-bora (lentils pakoras)
 ” (badale main surya ne kaha ki unhen banerjee kii mejabani or daavat kaa intjaam karnaa bahut acha lagegaa, lekin tabhi jab ve chunaav haarane ke baad narayangarh aaen
 ) Mamta's displeasure is understandable
 us “gathbandhan ke shilpkaar” hone ke naate jo “trinmul kii gardan marod rahaa he” (2014 se vam-congress kii vot hissedari 38 pratishat or tiemasi kii 39 pratishat rahi he), surya babu hi unke shabdabaanon ke nishane par hai
 Mamta has been ruthlessly attacking this "immoral alliance"
 ve kahati hai, “yah koi jot (gathbandhan) nahin he, yah ghont (girohabandi) he
 The CPM has already lost its ideology, its direction and now that it has joined the Congress, it will lose its address as well
 ”logon ko rijhanamishra ne bhi mukaable ko ooncha uthaa diya he
 He is raising the attention-grabbing lines of popular songs of Hindi films and turning them into slogans, "one Two Three Four, Trinamule Shob Chor (all are thieves in the Trinamool)"
 ” yahaan tak ki mamata ke priy naare “thanda maathaa kool-kool, aabaar ashbe trinmulya” par unka jawaab he “thanda maathaa kool-kool, jele jabe trinmulya”, jo narda or sharada ghotaalon main tiemasi netaaon kii liptata kii ore ishaara he
 People are enjoying it very much
 chaay kii dukaanon or local trainon main log bolte sunai dete hai, “thanda-thanda kool-kool, ebaar harbe trinmul
 "we never thought that Suryada could woo people so well," says a member of the cpm's state committee, who does so well with the frenzied Trinamool leaders
 ”vam dalon ke star prachaarak hone ke naate sooryakanth mishra puure rajya ko naap rahe hai or takreeban 100 reliyon ko sambodhit karenge
 In one rally after another they tell people, "leaders keep coming and going, but people are on top
" main yahaan aapaki hi vajah se hi hum
 "with each rally, these voices become a little louder, some stronger
" surya ne “janata kaa gathbandhan” (yah nayaa naam isliye, kyonki vam loktantric dharmanirpeksh morcha kuch zyada hi pechida he) ko bahut zyada udaar or khulaa bana diya he or harek ko, phir chaahe unka siyaasi rang kuch bhi ho, ek chat ke neeche aane kaa khulaa nyauta diya he
 Election analyst and political science professor at Rabindra Bharti University, Biswanath Chakraborty, says Suryakant's acceptance as a leader can be gauged from the spontaneous reactions at his rally
 ve kehete hai, “apane upar tiemasi ke hamalon ke baad khol main chale gaye vam kader ek baar phir badi taadaad main baahar aa rahe hai
 Now they are not scared
 garmi or aatank ke baavjood baari bheed yahi sabit karti he ki log badlaav ke liye betaab hai
 Jot would hope that this thing came out on the day of counting
 ”doctor kaa rajaneta ke taur par udaikatak uniwarsity main medical ke chaatr ke taur par sooryakanth ne siyasat main thodaa-bahut haath aajamaaya tha, lekin isamen sanjidagi nahin thi

" siyasat main unki dilchaspee tab badi jab ve midanapur main doctorl kii practice ke dauraan swatantraaa senaanee sukumaar sengupta ke sampark main aae
 Deputy Speaker Sonali Guha, who was famous for calling the Left mlas bad, once fainted on the floor of the assembly, Surya first ran to the well and treated him
 unki chhavi us bengali bhadra purush kii he jiske man main kisi ke prati durbhaavna nahin he
 Surya has been associated with his roots even after settling down in Kolkata and becoming a minister in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's cabinet

 According to the English newspaper 'times of India', the PDP-BJP alliance appointed Anees Ul Islam as Research Officer at the sher-e-kashmir International Conference Center (SKICC) in Srinagar

 However, Farooq Shah claims that Anees has been hired under the rules

 But many people who have applied for the job say that they were not called for the interview

 rigerv bank of india (arabiai) ke governor rahe urjit patel ke istife par baat karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki unase sarkaar ke koi matbhed nahin the
 His meeting with the government was also held in a good environment
 sarkaar kaa koi dabaav nahin tha ki vahistifaaden
 Even today they talk to him
 is sawaal par ki kya rigerv bank ke fund kaa sarkaar istemaal karnaa chaahati he jisase chunavi saal main sarkaar ko phayda mil sake
 On this, Jaitley said that neither for the budget, nor for the expenditure of the government, he needs one rupee from the RBI
 jetali ne kaha samay-samay par is baat par charchaa hoti rahi he kiarbiaiko kitna rigerv fund chahie
 It is not only about India
 puure vishwa main is baat kii charchaa hoti he
 Many committees were also formed in India to know how much is the reserve fund
 alag-alag deshon main yah 8 se lekar 18 percent tak he lekin bharat main yah 28 percent he
 There is no threat to the autonomy of the Reserve Bank
 sarkaar chuni hui hoti he
 He has to answer to the public and business
 yah jawaab rigerv bank ko nahin dena padataa
 Therefore, using various mechanisms, there is a meeting at the level of the Prime Minister, there should be a board meeting of the RBI and efforts should be made to resolve this liquidity and credit issue
 yah itnaa saral vishay nahin he, is masale ko hindustan kaa polytical media nahin samaj paaya
 Jaitley said that the money in the Reserve Bank is the country's money
 raghuram rajan ne bhi chitthee likhakar kaha tha ki rigerv bank main jo reserve he use kaise kharch kiya jaae
 It was changed to slogans without seriously understanding the subject
 urjit patel ke istife or sarkaar ke saath unke sambandh ke bare main bolte hue jetali ne kaha ki do arabiai governor raghuraaj raaman or urjit patel se unki baatcheet hoti he
 Jaitley also explained how the previous governments forced the RBI governors to resign
 jetali ne kaha ki jawaharlal nehru ne arabiai governor rama raav ko likhaa tha ki aap kii yojanaayen sarkaar ko saport karne vaali honi chahien
 After this, Governor Rama Rao resigned
 governor jagannatha ne maaruti ko karj dene se manaa kar diya to indira sarkaar ne unase istipha le liya
 During Chidambaram's tenure, he did not even talk to two RBI governors
 mere donon governor ke saath achche sambandh the or main aaj bhi unase sampark main hum
 There is no threat to rbi's autonomy, but if there is any problem in the economy, we will ask the Reserve Bank to come forward to help

 In fact, on July 24, four mps in the Lok Sabha had asked whether Indian Railways could not meet the cost of passengers and other services, to which Railway Minister Piyush Goyal replied
 duniya main jis cheez ke lakhon diwane hon, use phaltu or bekaar kahana khatarnaak he
 But taking the risk of abusing you, today i am going to do the same! Yes, all the Memory Cleaner, Memory Booster and Battery Saver Apps on Android phones are useless and useless
 na sirf phaltu hai, balki inkaa istemaal karne se kai baar aapako phaayde ke bajaae nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Now the question is, why then do millions of people not only download these apps from the Google Play store, but also call it fantastic? Before answering, i want to ask some questions
 kya ganesh ji doodh pite hai ? nahin naa? lekin desh -duniya main lakhon logon ne kya ek baar ganesh ji ko doodh nahin pilaayaa tha! kya bharat main aaj tak namak kabhi khatm hua he? to phir kyon ek nahin balki anek baar logon ne namak khatm hone kii afvaah par ghar main kai maheenon kaa namak kharid kar bhar liya! jis bank ke diwalia hone kii afvaah par log sara paisa nikaal kar ghar le aae, atm par lambii line lag gayi kya wo diwalia ho gaya?dekha-dekhi or afvaah kii vajah se bahut se log kuch karne lage to ham bhi us par yakeen karne lagate hai
 But this does not correct the wrong thing
 Play Store main aise Memory Cleaner, Auto Apps Killer, Battery Saver Apps or Memory Booster bharmaar he jo ye daawa karte hai ki agar aap inhen apane phone main downlod kar len, to ye palak jhapakate hi aapke phone ko Fast bana denge or aapke phone kii betry bhi zyada lambii chalegi
 Such apps try to convince us that the memory of the phone (RAM) is full, the running of apps in the backgroud is very bad for the health of the phone and battery
 baat sunne main thik bhi lagati he ki memri jitani khaali hogi, phone utana tej chalegaa
 It also seems quite right that if many apps are hiding in the backgroud of the phone, even after not being used, they have not stopped completely, then they will continue to drink the battery
 ab aise main koi ye kahe ki wo na sirf bekagranud main chhip kar chalane vaale Apps ko Kill karata rahegaa, balki khud ba khud, kuch-kuch der par ye check bhi karata rahegaa ki kahin ye ziddee Apps phir se chaalu to nahin ho gayi to sunne main baat samajhadaari kii lagati he
 Brother, neither the useless apps will run in the background, nor will the Android phone slow down or the battery will go! Isn't it wonderful? No, this is absolutely nonsense! Let me tell you why
 App kaa 'chaalu rahanaa' or 'chalanaa' bilkul alag-algaendroid software is tarah banaaya gaya he ki isamen tamaam Apps kam se kam power kaa istemaal karke teji se chal saken
 Now first of all it is important to understand that 'running' and 'running' of an App in Android is completely different
 android phone apane memri (RAM) kaa istemaal bilkul alag tarah se karata he
 When you close an application using it, instead of going home completely closed, it sits quietly on the memory bench there
 aisa ek nahin, ek ke baad ek, tamaam Apps karte hai
 Instead of completely shutting down their house, they go and sit on the bench named Memari, sitting nearby
 memory kii bench par baithe Apps koi betry nahin kharch kartejis App ko aapane abhi fouran band kiya - wo line main sabase aage hoga
 This series of sitting on the line goes on as long as there will be a place on this bench called memory
 jab jagah khatm hone lagegi to jo App line main sabase peeche hoga, yani jisko aapane sabase pehle band kiya tha - wo ab puri tarah band hokar ghar chalaa jayega
 When you start a new job on the phone, like you started playing a new game and it is running low on memory, some apps sitting in the line automatically shut down automatically to make room for them
 
 android aisa kyon karata he ye bataane se pehle ye jaan lijie kii memri kii bench par line lagaakar chupachaar baithe hue Apps koi betry nahin kharch karte - bilkul bhi nahin
 They just look on - they don't move
 jabatak aap use chalaaen nahin
 Now, the question arises that instead of being completely closed, why do they stay on the memory bench by putting a line? After all, the memory of the phone looks almost full at all times, which you have to use these Memory Killer Apps to clear
 jawaab aise samajhie
 You have hired a taxi to go to many places throughout the day
 to aap kaisaa driver pasand karenge - jo baar-baar gaadi band karke chaay pine gaayab ho jaae or har baar aane par aapako use phone karke bulaanaa pade, yaa phir aisa driver jo aapako har baar gaadi kii seat par mustaid mili?android bhi yahi karata he
 When not needed, he keeps apps on the memory seat like a driver so that he can appear immediately when he is called, that is, when the app is needed again
 jis tarah sirf driver ke seat par baithe rahane se gaadi kaa petrol kharch nahin hoga usee tarah mahaj Apps ke memri main baithe rahane se betry kharch nahin hoti
 Therefore, memory (RAM) always looks full but not bad
 Apps agar baar-baar puri tarah band hokar phir se chaalu honge to na sirf khulne main der lagaanege balki chaalu or band hone main hi phaltu betry phunkate rahenge
 Apps Killer, Memory Booster, Battery Saver and Memory Cleaner keep doing the same thing - shutting down apps sitting silently in memory and sending them home
 kamaal kii baat ye he ki inamen tamaam aisi chijen bhi band hoti rahati hai jinke bina android phone chal hi nahin saktaa
 Therefore, they start again after a few moments
 or aapkaa pyaara App Killer, Battery Saver phir se use band karke aap par ahsaan jataata rahata he ki usne aapke phone kii kitni memri free kar di he
 Side effect of Apps Killer - Memory Cleaner: Now the question arises that if this is the case then why do some people really benefit from using these apps and their phone starts working better? The answer is that some Battery Saver App does some work besides killing the memory
 jaise, nahin istemaal hone par jeepies, bluetooth, wifai, lokation services band karnaa or internet kaa istemaal karne vaali kai services kaa sinc interval badha dena
 But you can do this work yourself easily, and better by using the power widget already present in the phone
 is chote se kaam ke liye Apps Killer - Memory Cleaner naam ke bandar ke haath main ustara pakadaane kii jarurat nahin he
 Have you ever noticed that when you put things like Memory Booster, Memory Cleaner, Battery Saver in your phone, then what do you get the permission to do silently? Once the phone has not been handed over to them, when do they know what to stop, what settings to change in the phone, what to blow

 While on one hand there is Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling himself the janitor, on the other side there is the Gandhi family headed by Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 pradhanmantri narendra modi lagaataar gandhi parivaar par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai or congress netaa un par palatwaar kar rahe hai
 Now, while replying to Narendra Modi's attack on Gandhi family, Congress leader PC Chacko has described Gandhi family as the first family in the country
 unka kahana he ki aaj desh jahaan khadaa he, wo isi pratham parivaar kii vajah se he
 The country should be grateful to the Gandhi family
 shanivaar ko samachar agency eenai se baatcheet ke dauraan congress netaa pisi chaako ne kaha ki hindustan ke pratham parivaar ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vichaar nakaaratmak hai
 The Gandhi family is truly the first family in the country
 bharat ko is pratham parivaar kaa abhaari hona chahie
 Congress leader Chacko said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi talks of developing the ability to kill in space, whereas the reality is that India has reached here because of the leadership and planning of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 congress netaa ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bharat ke itihaas ke bare main jaankaree nahin he
 He said that Narendra Modi does not know that when India became independent, what was the situation here? During the reign of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country became self-sufficient by the Green Revolution and the White Revolution
 unhone kaha ki desh ko banane main gandhi parivaar ke yogadan ko mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 During this time, Chacko also claimed that Rahul Gandhi will become the next Prime Minister of India and Narendra Modi will see this happening
 bijepi ne congress par bolaa tikhaa hamalaavahin, bhartiya janata party ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki is desh main paarivaarwaad kii partiyaan hai, lekin ab baat isse bhi aage chali gai he
 Today Congress leaders are saying that the Gandhi family should be considered as the first family of the country
 yah loktantr ke liye khatra he
 Let us tell you that 58 central schemes of the country are in the name of nehru-gandhi family
 450 se zyada chijen gandhi parivaar ke naam hai
 Apart from this, Sangh thinker Sangeet Ragi said that political iconography has been done in the name of a family in this country
 unhone kaha ki pisi chaako kaa bayaan loktantr kaa bahut bada apmaan he
 In democracy, there is no first family
 unhone kaha ki congress party ek paariwarik party he or iske andar hi hameshaa se satta kaa hastantaran hota rahaa he
 Where is the first family? Debate has erupted on this issue since Congress leader PC Chacko called the Gandhi family the first family of India
 ab yahaan sawaal ye hai ki aakhir gandhi parivaar bharat kaa pratham parivaar kaise he? pratham parivaar kahaan hota he? aapako bataa den ki jahaan rajshahi hoti he, vahaan hi pratham parivaar hota he
 The first family is in 28 countries such as Britain, Japan and Saudi Arabia
 bharat jaise loktantr main pratham naagarik hota he, na ki pratham parivaar
 Now many monarchical countries have democratic governments, but in countries with monarchy, only the first family heads the country
 congress ke netaaon kii yahi gandhi parivaar kii bhakthi narendra modi ko un par hamale kaa mauka detii hai

 Had come purv kendriya mantri aran shouri ne kaha he ki unhone 2ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale ke bare main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko jaankaree di thi lekin unhone is bare main kuch nahin kiya
 Shourie said that the journalists who wanted to highlight the matter, had prepared a note by taking papers related to it and had taken it to the gallery of the Rajya Sabha and shown it to the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha, ‘maine manmohan singh se kagajaat ko dekhne ko kaha, unhen bataaya ki isamen bade str par bhrashtachar he
 When asked about the Prime Minister's response, the former Union Minister said, "manmohan Singh touched his turban
" jo vah hameshaa karte hai
 According to him, the Prime Minister replied, 'what can be done
 maine unase kaha ki aap kar sakate hai

 Childhood love happens with time, but with difficulties
 ab ye mushkilen koun-koun si hai, ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Talking about the merits and demerits of the film, first of all it seems that writer Supratik Sen and director Abhishek Kapoor could not completely adapt the novel 'the Great Expectations' in a 2 hour and 10 minute film, due to which the film was loose in the first part
 is
 kashmir kii mushkilon ke jariye kahani ko aage badhaane kii koshish kii gai he par ye mushkilen na bhi dikhti to harz nahin tha kyonki film khatm hote hi shaayad aapako lage ki jis raah par chalanaa nahin tha vahaan kadam rakhane kii zarurat kyon padi? Showing an aspect without touching the depth can cause the viewer to wander
 film ek lav story he par script main ishq kaa junun kam dikhaai padataa he
 The songs are good but i liked the Pashmina song like an advertisement
 nirdeshak abhishek kapur kii 'fitur' kii sabase kamazor kadi he isaki ulti-pulti script
 The plays are extremely beautiful, but the story seems bleak

 chunki ham par party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he, jabaki hamane aisa kuch kiya nahin he, aise main hamane istipha dena pasand kiya

 unke mutabik yediurppa ke nivas par ek baithak main unhen tyaagptr saunpe gaye
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Satish met Yeddyurappa on Saturday and persuaded him to calm down and not take any hasty steps, but his efforts also failed

 ishwarappa ne ek patr bhejkar yediurppa ke samarthak kuch mantriyon par party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya tha or unke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii thi

 Is not giving and is asking them to come out cleanly in cases of corruption

 The Bureau (CBI) has said that three arrested senior officers of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) have 'retracted' their statements given during the investigation and hence further investigation is being done to ascertain the actual beneficiaries

 Senior counsel KK Venugopal, appearing for the CBI, said before a bench of judges GS Singhvi and AK Ganguly, "they had taken all the responsibility for the verdict but during the hearing of the bail plea in the High Court said that they were only employees
" And they did not get any benefit

 Subsequently, detailing the investigation against the Tata group, the agency said that instead of benefiting from the scam, they incurred losses because Raja had conspired

 The RLD may disassociate itself from the SP-BSP alliance
 is faisle ke baad party upi vidhansabha ke upachunaav akeli ladegi
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, SP-BSP and RLD formed an alliance to stop BJP in Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state
 gauratlab he ki bispi ne khud ko is gathbandhan se alag karne ke sanket die the
 Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh has also indicated that the alliance is not going to run
 loksabhaa chunaav main teenon dal saath milakar lade the phir bhi bijepi kaa muqabla karne main naakaam rahe
 In the election results, the BSP had won 10 seats while the SP had won only 5 seats, while the western UP party RLD could not win a single seat
 saaf he areldi ko gathbandhan main chunaav ladane se koi phayda nahin hua or aise main ab ajit singh kii party bhi gathbandhan se alag ho gai he
 BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday announced that she would break away from the alliance and contest the bye-election, though she has now ruled out putting a full break on the alliance
 mayawati ne akhilesh yadav ko espi main sudhaar karne kii hidaayat dete hue kaha ki espi ke kader ko bispi kii tarah mishanri banane kii jarurat he or agar akhilesh aisa kar pate hai to hi bhavishya main donon dal saath milakar chunaav ladenge, varna alag raah talashni padegi
 Mayawati has said that there is no transfer of sp's vote to BSP
 saath hi yadav vot ke espi se khisakane kaa bhi daawa kiya
 He said that the defeat of Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav and brother Akshay Yadav in the Yadav dominated seats is a sign that the Yadav vote is no longer tied to the SP
 mayawati ne akhilesh or dimple se achche nijee rishton kaa hawaal dete hue kaha ki ve bhavishya main bhi unke dukh-sukh ke saathi bane rahenge
 There is a big revelation about the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 in chunaavon main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rajnatik partiyaan ladakiyon kii taskari kar sakati hai
 The motive of the parties behind doing this is being told to increase their vote bank
 yah puraa khulaasa ek enjio ne haal hi main kiya he
 Big disclosure of NGO An NGO named Shaktivahini has prepared to give information about this whole matter to the Election Commission
 is enjio ke sadsy shashikant ne bataaya ki vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan ladakiyon keetaskarior unke shoshan kii prabal sambhaavna he
 The latest example is the arrest of 32 girls from Chhattisgarh in a firm in Baran area of allahabad
 vot bank kii nai raajnneetiuttar pradesh or bihar ke gramin ilaakon main kisi bhi samaaroh ke dauraan ladakiyon kaa dance aam baat he lekin inkaa istemaal chunaav main vot bank ko badhaane ke liye karnaa gaiyrkanoonee he
 Not only this, it is being told that in political programs these girls are also sexually abused after feeding them narcotics
 is puure ghatnakram kii jaankaree unheen 32 ladakiyon main se ek 14 saal kii maasoom bacchee ne di he
 Physical abuse by feeding drugs: Bachchi said that he is fed drugs only during late night dance
 uske baad nashe kii haalat main unhen partiyon main aane vaale logon ko saunp diya jaataa he
 These people mistreat them
 is puure maamle main balod jile ke esai aarif shaikh ne bataaya ki chhattisgarh ke garib parivaraladakiyonko paisa kamaane ke bahaane paas ke shaharon yaa duusare rajyon main bhej dete hai
 While it is common for them to be physically abused, this kind of action under the guise of a dance company is shocking
 pehle bhi ho chuki he ghatnahalanki pashchim bengal siaidi pramukh sabari bhattacharya kaa kahana he ki do saal pehle 2014 main uttar pradesh ke gonda jile main is tarah ke ek giroh ko pardaafash kiya ja chukaa he, jo garib naaballig ladakiyon ko steroid or nashila padaarth khilaakar unhen apane graahakon ko yon shoshan ke liye bhej dete the
 Explain that by giving steroids the body of those innocent girls starts maturing
 haalanki gramin ilaakon main is tarah ke dance aam hai lekin is dauraan shaareerik shoshan kii baat hairaan karne vaali he
 Above all, to use it during election campaign is really embarrassing
 chand voton ke khatir ek ladki kii izzat ke saath khilwaad karnaa, nishchit taur par bardaasht karne ke laayak nahin he
 Delhi Police has arrested two auto drivers named Abhishek and Pradeep

 Earlier, Asaduddin Owaisi had targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pulwama terror attack and asked if he had 'slept with beef biryani', while 40 CRPF personnel were martyred
 asaduddin ke chote bhai evam party vidhayak akbaruddin ovaisi ne bhi piem modi par unke ‘main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan ko lekar nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha tha ki yadi pradhanmantri ek vaachaman bananaa chaahate hai to vah unhen chaukeedaar kii topi or siti denge
 Hyderabad MP Asaduddin, while addressing an election meeting here, had underlined the statement by Home Minister Rajnath Singh that the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO) had about 300 before the Indian Air Force fighter airstrikes in Balakot, Pakistan
 Was traced to be 'active' mobile phone
 asaduddin (asaduddin Owaisi) ne sawaal kiya tha ki ‘main rajnath singh or pradhanmantri modi se poochna chahta hum ki yadi antiaro balakot main kareeb 300 mobile phone dekh saktaa he to kya dilli main baithkar aap yah nahin dekh paye ki kis tarah se 50 kilogram ardex pulavama main laayaa gaya''
 He said, '50 kg RDX was brought under your nose to Pulwama
 kya aap use nahin dekh paye? kya aap soye hue the? kya aapane biryani khaayi thi
 You may have eaten beef biryani and fallen asleep

 He said that "I am surprised at the 'modi devotees' and those who vote for Modi

 He had said that "I want to tell Narendra Modi that you were a 'chaiwala' and people made you prime minister and now you are saying that you are a watchman

 a friend of mine showed on Twitter about watchman Narendra Modi, watchman Amit Shah '
 akbaruddin ne kaha tha ki ‘‘chaukeedaar keval twitor par hi kyon? chaukeedaar aadharcard, votercard or narendra modi ke passport par bhi daalen''
 Let us tell you that before the general elections, BJP has stepped up the campaign 'main Bhi Chowkidar' and all senior leaders including Modi as well as party president Amit Shah have added the word "chowkidar" to their Twitter handle

 Till earlier this year, Chandimal and Dikwela were the captains of the team in different formats, but Lasith Malinga was given the command after that and Sri Lanka have lost 12 matches in a row since then
 pichley do saal main alag-alag praaroop main srilanka ne nau captain dekhe jisase pataa chalata he ki sankat kis kadar gaharaa he
 The differences between Angelo Mathews and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha have added to the problem

 There was no place for Karunaratne in his team

 The Sri Lankan team, which has lost 55 odis out of 84 since the World Cup 2015, has not won a single bilateral series since May 2016

 In such a situation, the team will have to take inspiration from Mathews and Malinga

 The Bharatiya Janata Party is not getting tired of claiming the protection of the interests of Dalits, but most of the cases of attack on weak society are being seen in BJP ruled states only
 nayaa maamla haryana ke gurugram kaa he
 In the Wazirpur village of Cyber city, late Friday night, the caste people attacked Dalit families
 darasal kisi baat ko lekar kahasuni itani bad gai ki vajirpur gaanv ke rajput samudaay ke logon ne dalit basti main ghus lathi dandon se hamalaa kar diya
 Gurugram Police has initiated a probe on the complaint of the families of the Dalit society by registering a case
 haalanki graminon ne der shaam kisi tarah se baat ko sambhala ordonon pakshon main samjhauta bhi karwaane kaa bharsak prayaas kiya, lekin savarna jati ke logon ko shaayad yah baat nagavar gujri or der shaam hue jhagade ke baad subah tak takreeban 3 baar dalit basti main khud tandav machaaya
 According to the police, efforts were made to burn the slum shops with fire
 vahaan khadi gadiyon main todphod kii gai, or kanoon se bekhauf badmaash saream jatisuchak shabdon kaa istemaal karte rahe
 The police, who came into action after the complaint, have spoken about the investigation of the case instead of speaking clearly on the matter
 baharhaal maamle kii taftish jari he
 Let it be said that this is the same Wazirpur village in which the District President of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bhupinder Singh Chauhan and the bjp's Councilor Chairman Kalyan Singh Chauhan live
 haalanki maamle main rajnatik dabaav se inkaar bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But this attack has once again raised questions on the security of Dalits
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne pune sthit ghoda kaarobaari hasan ali khan ke khilaaf kathith taur par kaledhan ko safed karne ke maamle main aarope patr daakhil kiye jane ke bare main khud ko andhere main rakhe jane par pravartan nideshaalay ko aade haathon liya or is ghatnakram par hairaani jataai
 The court also questioned the functioning of a high-level committee set up by the government to oversee the investigation into this sensitive matter
 sheersh nyaayalay ne chaar may ko is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan us samay naaraazgi vyakt kii thi, jab pravartan nideshaalay ne khan evam anya se jude kalaadhan maamle kii jaanch se sambandhit sthiti report pesh kii thi lekin usamen yah zikr nahin kiya gaya tha ki mumbai kii vishesh adaalat ke samaksh chah may ko aaropapatr daayar kiya jaayegaa
 The Supreme Court is monitoring cases related to black money
 hasan ali ke maamle main nyaayamurti bi sudarshan reddy or nyaayamurti eses nijjar kii peeth ne poocha, aapane hamen is baat kii soochna kyon nahin di gai ki hasan ali ke khilaaf jaanch puri ho gai he
 You (enforcement Directorate) in your status report said that investigation is going on
 iske do din baad hamane akhabaaron main padhaa ki aapane aarope patr daayar kar diya he
 It is necessary for us to object
 ucchtam nyaayalay kii peeth ne is baat par bhi aashcharya jataayaa ki aarope patr ko sarkaar kii ore se gathit ucch stareey samiti ke samaksh prastut kyon nahin kiya gaya
 The court said, "we thought that a retired judge of the Supreme Court should be appointed to oversee all such cases, but you created a separate mechanism for this
" ham dekhnaa chaahate hai ki aapke is tantra main kya kami he or yah kaise kaam karata rahaa he
 The court said, you filed it without presenting the charge sheet before the committee constituted on your behalf
 hamen aashcharya hua he
 "we had heard the case on May 4 but there was no mention in the status report on that day that the charge sheet would be presented on May 6," the bench said
 aapane is baat kaa sthiti report main koi ullekh nahin kiya
 There was no mention of the charge sheet
 sheersh adaalat ne poocha, is baat kaa kyon ullekh nahin kiya gaya tha ki aarope patr pesh kiya jayega
 The bench also asked, why it was not mentioned that the investigation work was complete and the chargesheet would be filed
 do din baad ham akhwar main padhate hai ki aaropapatr daayar kar diya gaya
 The Supreme Court said that the status report presented on May 4 said that the investigation work was still going on
 peeth ne kaha ki yah ascharyajanak he ki rajasav sachiv ke netritv vaali 10 sadasyeey samiti ke samaksh aarope patr ko nahin rakhaa gaya
 "we thought that one should look into the chargesheet," the bench said
 ise sarkaar kii ore se gathit samiti ke samaksh rakhaa janaa chahie tha
 The bench said that the question is related to the monitoring of the investigation for which a mechanism was set up by the government opposing the formation of a special investigation team
 sheersh nyaayalay kii peeth ne salisitor general gopal subramanyam se kaha, hamen aashcharya he ki aapane ek tantra sujhaayaa or nigaraanee ke liye tantra kaa gathan kiya
 
 subramanyam ne is baat par sahmati vyakt kii ki aarope patr ko samiti ke samaksh rakhaa janaa chahie tha
 He said that corrective measures will be taken
 adaalat ne pravartan nideshaalay se yachikakartaon ko 900 pannon ke aarope patr kii prati dene kaa nirdesh diya
 The court was hearing a case filed by eminent lawyer Ram Jethmalani and others, seeking action to bring back the money of Indians deposited in banks located abroad
 vishwa bazaar main aane vaale maheenon main bhi kachche tel ke daam yadi 100 dollar prati bairal ke idgird hi tike rahete hai to saarvajanik kshetra kii tel vipanan companiyon kaa nuksaan agle vitt varsh main 98,000 karod rupee tak pahunch saktaa he
 In a report by broker firm IIFL, it has been stated that after touching the crude oil price of $ 100 per barrel in February, it was believed that the under recovery of oil companies in the current financial year is Rs 72,000 crore
 Will reach
 india impholine research ke visheshgy prayesh jain ne kaha ki yadi kachche tel ke daam 100 dollar prati bairal ke aasapaas hi bane rahete hai or sthiti main koi badlaav nahin aata he to agle vitt varsh main petroleum padaarthon kii bikri karne vaali tel vipanan companiyon kii kul kam vasuuli 98,000 karod rupee tak pahunch sakati he
 This figure is not far from one lakh crore rupees
 report ke anusaar april se disambar 2010 kii avadhi main jab kachche tel ke daam ausatan 80 dollar prati bairal par chal rahe the tab tel companiyon kii kam vasuuli 47,000 karod rupee tak aanki gai
 However, crude oil prices have remained at an average of $ 101 per barrel in the fourth quarter
 isse tel companiyon kii kam vasuuli 25,000 karod rupee tak badhane kii ashanka he
 With this, their low realization is estimated to be Rs 72,000 crore in the current financial year, but if the situation does not improve, it could reach Rs 1 lakh crore in the next financial year

 In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India, in a bulletin on social sector spending on India, said that spending on this sector, primarily consisting of education and health, was regretfully lower than its counterparts
