 Congress President Rahul Gandhi continues to ask questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi under 'gujarat Mange Jawab'
 mangalvaar ko rahul ne daliton kii suraksha ke mudde par piem par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Rahul also mentioned the Una incident in his tweet and said that a lot of laws have been made in the name of Dalits, but who will do them properly
 rahul ne twit kar 14waan sawaal poocha, ''na jameen, na rojgaar, na swasthya, na shiksha gujarat ke daliton ko mili he bas asuraksha oona kii dardanaak ghatana par modiji hai maun is ghatana kii javabdehi legaa phir koun? kanoon to bahut bane daliton ke naam koun degaa magar inhe sahi anjaam?''
 It is worth mentioning that the issue of assault with Dalit youth had come up in Una, which caused quite a ruckus

 Now the Congress MLA has disclosed such an audio
 congress vidhayak shivaram hebbar kaa kahana he ki ek audio tepe main kaha gaya tha ki kisi bijepi netaa ne unki patni ko phone kiya tha, or isamen rishwat kii baat kai gai thi
 But it is not that his wife did not receive any kind of call
 yellapur se congress vidhayak shivaram ne apane fasebuk wal par likhaa ki mujhe pataa laga he kinus channelone meri patni or bijepi netaa kii baatcheet kaa audio chalaaya tha
 i want to say that it was not my wife's voice, my wife did not get any kind of call

 i thank the people of my region for choosing me
 gauratlab he ki bahumat pareekshan se pehle congress party bijepi par puri tarah se hamalavar thi
 The Congress had accused the BJP of intimidating and bribing their mlas
 aarope lagaate hue congress ne kai audio tepe bhi jari kiye the
 But in the meantime, the question of a Congress MLA thus raising audio tapes raises many questions
 congress netaa ke is bayaan par bijepi ne bhi nishaanaa saadhaa he
 bjp's Amit Malviya tweeted that the allegation that the Congress had made on the BJP has been misunderstood by their MLA
 congress ko galat khabar failaane par shame aane chahie
 Facebook post of Congress MLA Shivram Hebbar from Yellapur, in which he denies his wife ever getting a call from BJP, calls it a fake audio clip
 
 
 Shame on Congress for brazenly lying, spreading mis-information and media channels for lapping it up
 It is all over regional paper

 a case of gang rape has come to light with a young woman maid working in Greater Noida, adjacent to Delhi
 police main darj shikaayat ke anusaar, peedita jiske ghar main kaam karti he, us ghar kii malkin bhi gangrape kii sajeesh main shaamil thi
 The police have registered a case against four people, including the mistress, on the basis of the victim's statement and started searching for the accused
 police ke mutabik, 25 varshiya peedita greater noida ke kasana thana ilaake main apane pati ke saath rahati he
 She used to work as a housemaid for a woman named Sonia in Swarna Nagri Janta Flat
 beete shanivaar ko jab vah sonia ke ghar kaam karne pahunchi to sonia ne use sumit naam ke apane ek jaankaar ke saath bike par sabji laane ke liye bhej diya
 But the accused youth took advantage of the opportunity and called two of his accomplices and carried out the gang rape incident with the woman
 peedit mahila ke pati ne kasana thana main teen aropiyon or ek mahila ke khilaaf maamla darj karavaaya
 The complaint states that the mistress of the house in which the victim works, asked her to go with a bike to a vegetable and bring vegetables
 ghatana shanivaar kii dopaher kii he
 The accused took the victim with her on the bike
 lekinraste main pehle se intjaar kar rahedo yuvakon ke saath milakar aaropee ne yuvati ko jabardastee scorpiyo car main bithaaya or teenon use kahin dur lekar chale gaye
 The three then gang-raped the victim in turn at the deserted place

 At present, the police have registered the case and sent the victim to the district hospital for medical treatment

 The Indian pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa were eliminated from the Olympics due to the result of the match between Japan and Chinese Taipei
 bhartiya coach pulela gopichand ne aaj aarope lagaaya ki mizuki fuji or reka kakivaa kii japani jodi group bi ke antim match main taipai ke khilaaf haar gayi
 The BWF disqualified eight women doubles players from the Games after investigating match-fixing allegations
 gopichand ne kaha, ‘hamane aaj subah virodh darj kiya tha or beadbluef ne kaha ki unhen maichon main koi bhedbhaav yaa saamaanya cheez se zyada kuch nahin mila
 We have filed an appeal reviewing this decision
 unhone kaha, ‘group bi main chini taipai ko jeetna tha or vah jeetna chaahati thi lekin japani team china se bhidnt se bachane ke liye harkar group main duusare sthaan par rahanaa chaahati thi
 Gopichand said that so far the BWF has indicated that no action will be taken against the Japanese pair

 According to Gopichand, match fixing does not end here
 varsh 2001 ke aal england champion ne daawa kiya ki china ke kal subah group di main denmark ke haarane ke baad japan group bi main duusare sthaan par rahanaa chahta tha
 Fuji and Kakiva lost to Chinese Taipei's unseeded pairings Cheng Wen Sing and Chen Yu Chin 21-19 21-11 in the morning
 jwaala or ashvini chini taipai kii jodi or singapore jodi ke khilaaf jeet ke baavjood agle daur main kwalifai nahin kar paayi
 He said, 'just because the audience did not create a ruckus, there was no uproar in TV, it does not mean that it did not happen
 is match main keval ek team haarana chaahati thi
 Gopichand said, 'I want to say that there is a flaw in the system itself
 padak jeetne ke liye khilaadi vahiin karenge jo ve kar sakate hai or agar haar kaa matlab behatar dra he to ve aisa karenge
 But the first flaw is the system itself
 gopichand ne kaha ki robin round pranali se jo hua he, jwaala or ashvini usase niraash hai
 He said, 'when you have been working so many years and doing your best and you are unable to qualify because some other team has deliberately lost in the match then the round robin system needs to be improved
 beadbluef ne bayaan jari kiya he ki indonesian or korian tiimon ne khud ko ayogy tehraane ke faisle ke khilaaf apil kii he or antim faisle ke baad press conferes kii jaayegi
 Earlier, President of Badminton Association of India (BY), Akhilesh Das Gupta said that this official protest was rejected due to lack of evidence
 das gupta ne kaha, ‘bai kii taraf se hamane yah kehete hue virodh darj kiya tha ki japan or chini taipai ke bich match bhi fiks tha jisamen japan ne jaanboojhkar match kho diya taaki agle round main use behatar dra mil sake
 That is why India did not get a chance to qualify in the next round
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin ab, unhone hamaara virodh khaarij kar diya he
 We are also surprised by this
 ek din pehle hamane chini taipai ko haraaya or ve kwalifai kar gayi hai or hamen isaliye kwalifai nahin kiya gaya kyonki japani team jaanboojhkar haar gayi
 Jwala and Ashwini finished third in the table by a margin of three points while Chinese Taipei (21) and Japan (four) qualified for the quarterfinals from the group
 taipai, japan or bharat prayek ne do do match jite or ek match ganvaaye
 But when the difference was calculated, India reached the third position
 rashtramandal khelon main swarna padak jeetne vaali yugal jodi kii khilaadi jwaala gutta ne kaha ki ve puri tarah se niraash hai
 Jwala said, 'we are completely disappointed
 ham itnaa acha khele phir bhi kwalifai nahin kar paye kyonki koi anya team jaanboojhkar match haar rahi he
 We worked so hard for the Olympics and we were surprised to see the results
 unhone kaha, ‘jaraa dekhiye kis tarah se japani jodi chini taipai kii jodi se haar gayi 
 i don't know what they were thinking but it is disappointing
 is tarah kii ghatnaon se khilaadi olympic kii garima ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai

 Before sending the request letter, the Enforcement Directorate contacted their counterparts in other countries who were aware of certain telecom companies receiving the spectrum allocation from September 2007 to January 2008 on a semi-formal basis

 Preparations were being made for a reshuffle in the Union Cabinet in the capital Delhi, about 200 km from where BJP President Amit Shah was attending the coordination meeting of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on 1 September in Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh
 
 sangh ke aanushanbik sanghathanon kii manshaa pradhanmantri tak pahunch rahi thi or usee ke alok main vibhaagon ke liye upyukt paatr (mantri) tay kiye jane lage
 The cabinet was sworn in before the three-day (1 to 3 September) meeting of the union and the responsibility of the departments was also fixed
 beshak, sangh kii yah baithak kisi nirnay ke liye nahin balki aapasi samvaad ke liye hui lekin, yahaan bade paimaane par centre or bhaajapa shasit rajya sarkaron kii nitiyon or nitinirdharakon ke liye badlaav ke beej bo die gaye
 The Sangh will consider how this seed of change will take shape in its executive board meeting next month
 is vichaar ko jameen par utaarne ke liye bhaajapa netritv ke paas paanch maheene (march 2018) tak kaa samay he
 There will be a meeting of the All India House of Representatives in March next year in which the Sangh would like to be confident that the BJP and the government are going in the right direction under the formula for change
 yahaan yah bataanaa lajimi hoga ki isi tarah kii samanyav baithak 2003 ke sitambar main hui thi
 The Vajpayee government did not give due attention to the question raised in the meeting
 india shining ke jaighosh tale sangh kii aawaaj ko dabaa diya gaya tha
 At that time, the Vajpayee government had to face defeat at the hands of the Congress, which was considered weak in terms of organization and leader
 akhil bhartiya samanvay baithak main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat, sah sarkairvah bhaiyaji joshi, sangh main bhaajapa kaa kaary dekh rahe krishna gopal teenon din upasthit rahe
 BJP president Amit Shah was present throughout the day on 1 September
 kaarykram main grahamantri rajnath singh or vitt mantri arun jetali ko bhi upasthit rahanaa tha lekin masaroofiyat kii vajah se baithak main ve nahin pahunch sake
 Apart from these leaders, representatives of 35 organizations associated with the Sangh were present
 yah baithak aise samay hui jab haryana main gurmeet singh maamle ko sanbhaalane main khatter sarkaar kii vifaltaa or darjanon logon kii hui maut or hinsa kaa tandav charchaa main tha
 The Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh was stuck in a cycle of questions about the death of more than 60 children in Gorakhpur hospital
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya or unki durdasha tathaa mahangaai jaise shaashvat sawaalon ko lekar aanushanbik sanghathanon ke bich charchaa kaa samay kam pad gaya
 Union sources say that in three days every issue related to society and country was fiercely discussed and on behalf of almost every subsidiary organization, it was expressed that people have started giving up their expectations from the BJP ruled governments
 janata kii taraf se janpratinidhiyon yaa sanghathanon ke jariye sarkaar tak pahunchane vaali baat ansuni ho rahi he
 The stream is flowing upside down
 sarkaar apni baat janata ke jariye lagu karana chaahati he yaa kara rahi he
 The public is facing the problems faced in doing this and the government is putting its time and energy in removing its standing problems and is showing its achievement
 masalan, kaala dhan rakhane vaale ko pakadia
 The government put the entire country in line and closed the note of five hundred thousand and entered the closed vault of common people
 logon ko apaar ksht uthaanaa padaa or kai logon kii maut ho gai
 People did not expect this from the government
 kisaan apni aamadani doguna hote dekhnaa chaahate hai or sarkari vifaltaa kii vajah se kisaanon ko pyaaj or tamaato phenkna pad rahaa he
 The government is declaring its achievement on the crop insurance scheme, drop-more Crop and farmers are committing suicide
 swasthya beemaa yojana ko sarkaar apni uplabdhi bataa rahi he or sarkari aspataal main bachche oxigen kii kami se mar rahe hai
 Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Finance Advisory Council, Vishwa Hindu Parishad were very vocal in the meeting
 charchaa main yah baat saamne ai ki chunavi nattejey pradhanmantri narendra modi kii lokapriyata or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke sanghathan kaushal or prabandhan kaa nateeja hai
 But consequent work was seen on the ground to strengthen management and popularity
 sutron kaa kahana he ki udhaaharan goa kaa diya gaya
 It was said that the government was formed due to better management, the people had given a mandate like sitting in opposition
 vahaan manohar parrikar ke rahete jo kaam jameen par parinamdai dikh rahe the vah unke dilli aane ke baad dikhne band ho gaye
 Historical mandate found in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin kanoon-vyavastha, aspataalon or anya sarkari sansthaaon ke prabandhan main saadhaaran sudhaar hi dikh rahe hai
 For the first time in Haryana, the BJP government was formed with an absolute majority
 logon main ummid jaagi ki jis samasya se rajya jujh rahaa tha uskaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 But the way the administration went about the Jat reservation and the Rampal case, it seemed that the situation was not better than before
 gurmeet singh prakaran ke baad log bhaajapa ke sheersh netaaon se yah ummid kar rahe the ki ve chook karne vaale netaaon ko sabak sikhayenge lekin aisa kuch hua nahin
 After the death of 60 children in Gorakhpur hospital, people were expected to take strict action against the health minister, but the government could not come out of the old formula to investigate the matter, nor did it try to get out
 maharashtra main kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk nahin rahi
 This was the situation even before the bjp's rule
 aise main sirf aatmahatya kii ghatnaon main kami kii duhai dekar logon ko samajhaana aasaan nahin he
 In Jharkhand, the problem of controlling government babus has arisen many times at the organization level, but there is no hope of not getting any result
 bhaajapa shasit kai rajyon main logon ke sawaal anuttarit hai
 There are many unanswered questions about inflation, unbalanced distribution of food grains, employment, hospitals, education, red tape
 sangh se jude aanushanbik sanghathan, jo logon ke bich main kaam karte hai unke liye yah bataanaa mushkil he ki sarkaar paryaapt rojgaar de rahi he
 Especially in every street, dozens when questions are asked from unemployed youth and their parents
 antarrashtriya bazaar main crude aayal kii keemat 2014 ke mukaable aadhi hone ke baad bhi petrol-dijal saste kyon nahin ho rahe? janpratinidhi sarkaar ke jariye logon kii samasyaon kaa niraakaran kyon nahin kar paa rahe hai? sarkaar kii pakistan or china kii niti safal kyon nahin ho rahi he? kashmir ke halaat kaabo main kyon nahin aa rahe hai?aanushanbik sanghathanon kii aapasi charchaa or vichaaron ke aadan-pradaan ko bhaajapa adhyaksh shah ne bhi gambhirtha se suna
 The union officials also churned during the session on the talks held in the presence of Bhagwat
 yahaan jo sawaal uthe unka niraakaran kaise ho isko lekar bhaajapa kii jo bhi taiyaari hogi vah sangh main bhaajapa kaa kaam dekh rahe krishna gopal sangh padaadhikariyon tak pahunchaayenge
 Sources say that given the way the discussion has been done, there is a scope of ruckus in the policymakers of the central and BJP ruled states
 agle maheene sangh kii kaaryakarini mandal main parivartan ko lekar charchaa hogi or march main sangh kii pratinidhi sabha kii baithak se pehle jaruri parivartan kar bhaajapa yahaan uthe sawaalon ke thos jawaab pesh karegi
 Avoiding these questions is neither possible for the Sangh nor for the BJP leadership
 india shining kaa ghaav bhaajapa bhale hi bhul gai ho sangh bhuulaa nahin he
 Anyway, everyone is aware of how expensive the lapse can be for the modi-shah duo
 pakistan ke punjab praant ke ek chote se gaanv main sthit ek madrase main hue ek shaktishaalee bam visphot main kai bacchon sahit 16 logon kii maut ho gayi jabaki 120 anya ghayal ho gaye
 Officials confirmed the incident, stating that the madrasa was used to make bombs
 dakshini punjab ke miyaan channu ke nikat gaanv main sthaneey samyaanusaar subah kareeb das baje yah visphot hua
 According to locals, the blast took place in the explosives kept at the residence of Madrasa teacher Riyaz Ali
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki ali pratibandhit dharmik samooh kaa sadsy he
 Police and Relief Service officials told reporters that 16 people had died in the blast
 inamen kai bachche shaamil hai
 Dozens of houses have been destroyed by this explosion
 khaanewal jile ke swasthya adhikari mohammad usoof sumra ne kaha ki marane waalon kii sankhya main ijapha ho saktaa he
 There is a possibility of bodies being buried in the rubble of houses falling due to the explosion
 desh or duniya kaa itihaas kai kaarnon se khaas he

 a post shared by Akshara Singh (@singhakshara) on Oct 28, 2018 at 7:35am PDT Sensex plunges 572 points in two consecutive days, Nifty also saw a huge decline Auto and banking sector stocks saw a big decline on Thursday, according to the information, the auto sector did not get the expected help as the Modi government slammed the economy on August 23
 Made many big announcements to ummid kii ja rahi thi ki isse sthitiyaan badalengi or arthvyavastha kii gaadi patari par daudane lagegi
 But if you look at the situation just after 7 days of the announcement, then it seems that the steps taken are inadequate
 darasal desh main alag-alag sectoron se lagaataar aa rahi mandi kii khabaron or share bazaar main giravat ke bich beete shuukravaar ko vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne ek mahatvapurn press conference kar ek ke baad ek kai elaan kiye
 Nirmala Sitharaman assured the country that the Indian economy is strong and doing better than countries like china-us
 share bazaar main phir giravat haaavivitt mantri ke elaan ke baad sabase zyada share bazaar main raunak lautne kii ummid kii ja rahi thi
 The market also traded in the green mark for two days
 lekin uske baad phir bazaar par dabaav haaavee ho gaya he
 In two consecutive days (wednesday and Thursday), the SENSEX has lost 572 points
 nifti kii baat karen to 157 ank kii giravat darj kii gai he
 During the business, the banking sector shares have seen the biggest decline
 banking or auto sector kaa sabase bura halbanking sector ke sheyaron main giravat se sawaal uthta he ki kya bainkon ko 70 hajaar karod rupee die jane kaa elaan bhi kaam nahin aa rahaa he
 Nirmala Sitharaman had said that 70 thousand crore rupees will be given to government banks
 aise main bainkon ke liye nae karj dene main koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 Not only this, during the trading in the stock market on Thursday, the stock of auto sector also saw a big decline
 mahindra, tata motors, hero moto or bajaj auto ke share laal nishaan par band hue
 Experts are saying that the help announced for the auto industry is not enough to handle the situation
 fich solutions macro research ke mutabik beete hafte vitt mantri nirmala kaa auto industry ke liye kiye gaye elaan utsahit karne vaale nahin hai
 Fitch Solutions said steps to reduce the rate of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and plans to send old vehicles to the trash should be taken to halt the softening of the auto sector
 bajet se pehle bazaar main thi majbooteebhartiya share bazaar main 5 july ko bajet ke baad se asthirataa kaa maahaul he or isaki vajah se sesanks or nifti kaa graph laal nishaan kii taraf bad rahaa he
 The market was strong before July 5
 sensex ne 40 hajaar ke aankade ko bhi chuaa tha
 Sensex 40,003 on July 5, even on the budget day
 89 tak pahunchaa tha
 According to experts, the stock market had high expectations from the budget
 lekin jis tarah kaa bajet aayaa, usase sabase zyada prabhavit share bazaar hi hua
 The auto sector also had expectations first from the General Budget and then from the recent announcement by the Finance Minister
 lekin lagata he ummiden kaaphi hai or madad thodi mil rahi he
 Tell the auto industry in bad times, the country's auto sector has gone into reverse gear
 auto industry main lagaataar 9 maheene se bikri main giravat darj ho rahi he
 Sales of cars and motorcycles declined by 31 percent in July
 jisaki vajah se auto sector se jude saadhe teen lakh se zyada karmchaariyon kii naukari chali gai or kareeb 10 lakh naukariyaan khatre main hai
 The reasons for the economic slowdown have affected the rising prices of crude oil in the international market
 dollar ke mukaable rupee kii keemat ghat rahi he
 The price of one US dollar is touching the figure of 72 rupees
 aayaat ke mukaable niryaat main giravat se desh kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa badha or videshi mudra bhandar main kami ai he
 Apart from this, due to the ongoing trade war between the US and China, the risk of economic slowdown in the world is increasing rapidly, which has also affected India

 Such an increase in the use of state-of-the-art technology among the youth shows how much they are fond of the technology and communication medium that is taking a new color every second
 surveykshan ke mutabik, naujavaanon ke bich ‘fasebuk’ sabase lokapriy soshal netwarking site ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aayaa he jabaki ‘linkd-in’ is maamle main duusare paaydaan par he

 The Congress received a massive blow today when there was news of Krishna Tirath joining BJP
 ye khabar aayi bhi tab jab ajay maakan dilli ke kai netaaon ke saath eisisi mukhyalay main arvind kejariwal ke 'you turn' ke kilaaf press kanfrence kar rahe the
 In the middle press conference itself, journalists started asking questions related to Tirath's leaving the party
 congress se jawaab dete nahin ban rahaa tha
 After a while Sambhalkar Party said that it shows the disappointment of BJP which is trying to win elections with the help of leaders coming from other party
 tirath congress kaa dalit cheharaa raheen hai
 She has also been a minister in the UPA government apart from the Sheila government of Delhi
 dilli chunaav main wo party ke star capaner kii list main shaamil hone vaali thim
 But she left the party
 congress ke sutara bataa rahe hai ki ve patel nagar se tikat chaahati thim lekin party ne vahaan apane puraane ummidavaar rajesh lilothia kaa tikat kaatane se manaa kar diya
 Many Congress leaders believe that Tirath's departure will not make any difference because the Dalit politics that has been his strong base does not fit the bjp's agenda
 haalaanki ye bhi sant he ki congress saanp guzar jane ke baad lakeer peet rahi he

 However, arrangements are being made for necessary things like medicines, food packets and milk in the relief camps on behalf of the administration

 India Today editor Prabhu Chawla spoke to BJP national president Rajnath Singh during Aaj Tak's direct talk program
 anshahapako jeet kaa bahut vishwaas tha, par aapke saath vishwasghaat hua yaa bhitarghaat?ab to saare chunaav parinaam aane ke baad ham log isaki samiksha karenge ki koun-koun se aise pramukh kaaran rahe jinke kaaran bhaajapa ko apeksha ke anuroop parinaam nahin mili
 It is too early to say anything at this time
 2004 kii samiksha abhi 2009 tak puri nahin hui
 Anant Kumar Committee was set up in 2004
 har rajnatik party safalataa hasil karne ke liye praytn karti he
 While in 2004 only four states of the country had our government on the basis of clear majority, whereas in the first six states of 2009, there was a government on the basis of clear majority
 pehali baar dakshin bharat ke ek bade rajya karnataka main ham spasht bahumat se apni sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 This is a thing of the past
 aapako, narendra modi or adwani ji-teenon bade netaaon ko vishwaas tha ki aap sabase bade dal ke rup main aaenge
 The difference of 80 seats between AAP and Congress
 kahaan galati hui?agar rajnatik partiyon main jeet kaa vishwaas nahin ho to ve kisi bhi chunaav ko lard nahin sakenge
 The process of victory and defeat goes on
 itani buree haar hogi, pataa tha?ham logon ko vaanchit safalataa nahin mili
 We immediately got a telephone and congratulated Congress President Soniaji and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and i said that the BJP will continue to extend its constructive support
 aupchaarikta to kerani hi padati he
 This is expected in a healthy democracy
 duusari baar aap chunaav haar gaye
 Your leadership credibility is low
 aapke netritv ke upar vishwaas nahin karte log
 This does not mean that the credit is low
 jahaan tak congress party kaa prashn he, 18 se 20 varshon ke baad usne aisi safalataa hasil kii he
 Such fluctuations keep coming in the lives of political parties, so do not be discouraged about that
 18 saal main congress party vahaan tak pahunch gai jahaan 1989 main rajeev gandhi pahunche the
 It may be that the NDA achieves more success in two-and-a-half years
 is kaal main chunaav thode honge
 Rajnath Singh, you are cooking Khayali casserole
 khayali pilav kaa sawaal nahin he
 We should all move forward with a faith and overcome our shortcomings
 adwani ji ne jo party khadi kii, atal ji ne jis party ko netritv pradaan kiya, vahi party adwani ji ko jita nahin pai, dhokhaa ho gaya
 They are also part of the party
 jitaane kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 Sometimes there was a spectacular victory from the same Atal ji and Advani ji, then success was not achieved as expected
 aapke girane kii raftaar shuru hui he
 You came in from 183 to 137, from 137 to 116
 agali baar shaayad
 
 
 
 hamaare badhane kii raftaar aap bhul ja rahe hai
 You remember our shoot
 agar oonchi chalaang lagaani hoti he, to do kadam peeche bhi janaa hota he
 Next time BJP and NDA will definitely make a big jump
 tu step forward, van step becoward kii marxist theory par aap vishwaas karte hai, lekin aap to ek kadam aage badhate hai, do kadam peeche hat jate hai
 Communist parties are losing credibility as far as they are concerned
 pashchim bengal jo marxvaadiyon kaa garh rahaa he, vahaan par trinmul congress ne
 
 
 It does not seem that any of your slogans went wrong
 aap nakaaratmak ho gaye
 You said forced Prime Minister, old Congress
 budhinga congress aisi haaavee hui aap par ki aapako dhul chaatni padi
 This question does not arise
 ham logon ne muddon ke aadhaar par chunaav ladaa tha
 It was contested on the basis of inflation, internal and external security problems
 yah ho saktaa he ki jin muddon ko lekar ham chunaav lade the, unako janata ke gale ke neeche utaarne main hamen jitani safalataa hasil honi chahie thi, utani nahin hui
 The Congress's slogan was straightforward: Congress's hand came with the poor, with the common man, their pictures used to come here - poor man, laborers, street farmers
 aapke yahaan netaa hi netaa dikhaai dete the
 All the good is visible only after winning
 sabhi rajyon ke logon ke saath baithkar baat hogi ki kya khamiyaan raheen
 Now when Advani ji has taken the responsibility on himself, do you think you are not alive without him? Why are you forcing them? There is nothing to force
 adwani ji kaddavar netaa hai
 He has guided for a long time
 ham mahasoos karte hai ki bhavishya main bhi hamen unke maargdarshan kii jarurat he

 bagaiyr yatri udaan bharne kii vajah se paak airlines ko 18 karod kaa nuksaan36 haj vimaanon main bhi ek bhi yatri nahin hua savaar, khaali bharne padi udanpradhanmantri narendra modi ke vimaan ko apane hawaii kshetra se guzarane kii ijaajat nahin dene vaale pakistan kii airlines kii badahaali kaa bada khulaasa hua he
 No one wants to travel in the Pakistani planes struggling on the economic front
 alam yah he ki pakistan kii airlines ko yatri tak nahin mil rahe jiske chalate uske vimaanon ko bina yatri ke hi udaan bharna pad rahaa he
 82 aircraft of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had to fly without passengers
 iske chalate pakistani airlines ko 18 karod rupee kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 This is revealed by an audit report
 pakistani samachar channel jeeyo ke mutabik pakistan international airlines ne 2016-17 main islamabad hawaii adde se 46 aisi udaanen bhari, jinamein ek bhi yatri nahin tha
 Apart from this, 36 aircraft also flew for the Haj pilgrimage, but there was not a single passenger in these planes
 nuksaan ke baad bhi jaanch nahinis tarah kul milakar pakistan ke 82 vimaanon ne bina kisi yatri ke udaan bhari
 Due to this Pakistan International Airlines also suffered a huge loss of Rs 18 crore
 isse bhi zyada hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki pakistan international airlines ko itnaa zyada nuksaan hone ke baavjood maamle kii jaanch tak nahin kii gai, jabaki pakistan prashasan ko bhi isaki jaankaree di gai
 News of passengers flying without Pakistani planes has come to light when Pakistan is facing economic crisis
 uske khaane tak ke laale pad gaye hai
 Pakistan is battling with the Bengali, but its Prime Minister Imran Khan continues to threaten India for war over Article 370
 videshi nivesh ke liye beli dancearthik morche par fakakashi kii naubat jhel rahaa pakistan videshi nivesh laane ke liye begairat harakatein tak kar rahaa he
 Its hallmark was recently seen in Azerbaijan, which was part of the former Soviet Union
 ajarbaijan main videshi niveshkon ke sammelan main niveshkon ko lubhaane ke liye pakistan ne beli dancers kaa program rakhaa tha
 The Investment Conference was organized by Pakistan's outskirts Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Peshawar in Azerbaijan's capital Baku
 is sammelan kaa makasad pakistan ke praant khaybar pakhtoonkhva main videshi nivesh laana tha
 In the program, Pakistan not only informed about the possibilities of investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but the people present in the program were surprised when Belly Dancers came on stage to entertain them
 jammu-kashmir main muthbhed ke dauraan faraar hue do aatankiyon ke dilli kii taraf jane kii soochna ke baad dilli main hai alert ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 All the police stations have been asked to examine the silver colored Swift cars in their respective areas
 car jammu-kashmir number kii he
 a few days ago, during the encounter between the army and the militants in Jammu and Kashmir, two terrorists managed to escape from the Swift car of Jammu and Kashmir number, while others were killed by the soldiers
 dilli main ghus sakate hai aatankikar main visphotak or gola barood he
 The army suspects that both terrorists can enter Delhi with a car
 lihaaja, khufia agenciyon ne dilli police ko alert rahane ke nirdesh jari kiye hai
 Three days ago, after the said information of the intelligence, the police of all the police stations have been declared high alert in Delhi and have been asked to be vigilant
 teen din pehle dilli police ko ye jaankaree di gai thi
 Till yesterday, Vinod Kumar Binny, who walked step by step with Arvind Kejriwal, rebelled such that he even called his partner arrogant and dictator
 guuruuvaar ko AAP kii andruni kalah khulkar saamne aa gai
 The rebellious Binny attacked his own government and its head Kejriwal fiercely
 binni ne aarope lagaaya ki AAP kii sarkaar ne har mudde par dilli kii janata ke saath vaadakhilaphi kii
 Whether it is the issue of water and electricity bill cuts or Jan Lokpal or corruption
 party ke netaa satta kaa sukh bhogana chaahate hai
 The Congress is giving gestures and the AAP government is running for the name
 aam aadmi party kii kerani or kathani main fark aa gayaam aadmi party kaa gathan kisi ko mukhyamantri, vidhayak or saansad banane ke liye nahin hua tha
 People were troubled by corruption and oppression
 phir anna kaa andolan hua
 After which the Aam Aadmi Party was formed
 shaayad inhen siddhanton ke kaaran party ko dilli chunaav main achche nattejey mili he
 But suddenly everything has changed
 sarkaar main aate hi kerani-kathani main bahut fark aa gaya he
 In the election campaign, we had said that 700 liters of clean water will be given free to every family
 par achaanak hi sarkaar ne aisa faisla kiya jo chaunkaane vaala tha
 For those using more than 701 liters of water, it was decided to bill with surcharge
 yah to janata ke saath dhokhaa he
 "what happened to the 10 lakh 52 thousand people who did not pay the bill? You all will remember that Arvind Kejriwal went on a hunger strike in the beautiful city against the Delhi government
" mudda tha pani or bijli bill main bhrashtachar kaa
 People were upset with more bills
 kejariwal ne is dauraan logon se bill nahin dene kii apil kii thi
 Many did the same
 kariban 10 lakh 52 hajaar logon ne ek aplikeshan par sin karke apana virodh darj karaayaa tha
 Kejriwal promised that all bills will be forgiven when we come to power
 kisi par kanoonee karrwai nahin hogi
 But today, more than 15 days have passed, but what happened to the promise made to those 10 lakh 52 thousand people
 kisi ko nahin pataa
 There are cases of theft over thousands of people
 lakhon rupee kaa bakaayaa he
 Here too, there is a difference between words and actions
 bijli dar main katautee par bhi palatejab ham chunaav lard rahe the to har jagah yahi vaada karte the
 The electricity rate will be cut by 50 percent
 yani 1 lakh rupee kaa bijli bill dene vaale ko 50 hajaar kaa bill dena padegaa
 It did not have a 400 unit condition
 commercial, industrial, gharelu or jhuggi-jhopadi main bijli istemaal karne vaale logon ke liye alag-alag daren hongi, ye baat hamane kabhi nahin kahi
 But the government did the same
 chand logon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye hadabadi main sabsidi kaa khel kiya gaya is kaaran se dilli kii 90 fisadi janata chalaa hua mahasoos kar rahi he
 The truth is that the government is having fun in their office, but a legislator like me has to face the public
 sarkaar bane 19 din ho gaye, janalokapal bill kahaan?janalokapal bill party ke gathan kaa ek ahm mudda tha
 The party had promised in its manifesto that the Lokpal bill would be passed within 15 days of the formation of the government i
e
 on 29 December
 sarkaar 28 disambar ko bani, aaj 19 din biit chuke hai
 But there is no discussion on Lokpal Bill
 yah to janata ke saath dhokhaa he
 You promised 15 days
 inaki manshaa saaf he
 Somehow two months pass
 phir loksabhaa chunaav kii vajah se aachaar samhita lagu ho jaaegi
 We will enjoy the pleasure of power
 mahila suraksha ke mudde par kya hua?mahila suraksha kaa vishay sabase ahm he
 Today every newspaper has news of gang rape with a Danish woman near New Delhi station
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki sarkaar ke ek mantri kaa is mudde par koi bayaan nahin he
 If there were any other party government in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party would have raised the issue by holding a protest
 par sarkaar main aa gaye to mahila suraksha kaa mudda gaun ho gaya
 There was talk of formation of women commando force, but not even a circular was issued
 bhrashtachar ke mudde par shila dikshit or unke mantriyon paraaisa lagata he ki bhrashtachar ke mudde par arvind kejariwal ne congress ke saath samjhauta kar liya he
 When the party was contesting elections, it was said that as soon as we form the government, we will take action against Sheila Dixit and her corrupt ministers
 par hua kya? karrwai to chhodie jaanch ke liye ek aadesh tak nahin die gaye
 The most sorrow occurred when Kejriwal in the assembly gave Dr
 harshavardhan se kaha ki aap shila or unke mantriyon ke khilaaf saboot mahaiya karaaen
 The question is why you were making such serious allegations from the public forum when you did not have evidence
 kejariwal taanashaah or ghamandi havervind kejariwal taanashaah kism ke hai
 They do not listen to anyone else in front of them
 agar aap unase sahamat hai to unke saath hai varanaa aap chup rahe to behatar he
 Their eyes turn red when they are angry
 party ke saare faisle 4-5 log band kamare main karte hai
 All the decisions are made by Kejriwal and the others say yes
 agar aap kejariwal ke faisle se asahmat hote hai to ve pehle samajhaate hai or phir gussa ho jate hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party used Anna Hazare, Baba Ramdev and Kiran Bedi
 manish sisodiya, arvind kejariwal, sanjay singh or kumaar vishwaas puraane saathi hai
 Kejriwal has become arrogant after coming to power
 ve taanashaah kii tarah bartaav karte hai

 The actress said that she was young at the time and needed money

 Sanjay Raut has been tweeting through the war between the bjp-shiv Sena in Maharashtra for the past several days
 Sherkavi and Shire are saying everything with the arrow of their words, which needs thousands of words to reach the front
 is
 kaviyon kii panktiyaan or shaayaron kii shaayari kaa jindagi main aksar istemaal hota he or raajnneeti main to khaas taur par istemaal khaas hota he
 In Maharashtra, the riots of the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party are also being used in the poems
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut rojaanaa subah ek shaayari twit karte hai, jiske myne kuch or hi hote hai
 Special among these lions is that he uses those poets or ideological people whom he has opposed in political life to target his like-minded BJP
 bijepi ko nishane par lene ke liye kaam aayaa pakistankattar hindutv kii raajnneeti karne vaali shivasena aksar pakistan kaa kadaa virodh karti he
 After the Pulwama attack, it is necessary to pressurize the central government to take strong action, advocate for breaking the relations of cricket and trade with Pakistan
 har baar shivasena pakistan ke khilaaf hi rahati he, lekin somvaar ko kuch aisa hua ki har koi chaunk gaya
 Sanjay Raut on Monday targeted the BJP, tweeting a lion of Pakistani poet Habib Zalib, who continued to promote the Left throughout his life
 sanjay raut ne likhaa, ‘tum se pehle wo jo ek shaks yahaan takht-nashin tha, us ko bhi apane khuda hone pe itnaa hi yaqin tha’
 Before you, the person who used to be a takht-nashi, was so confident in his own self: - Habib Zalib - Sanjay Raut (@ rautsanjay61) November 18, 2019 Opposing like-minded BJP to form government, opposite-minded Congress -the Shiv Sena coming with the NCP is also using the opposite ideology in poetry
 bijepi ko sadhate hue galat shaayar ko diya credit12 november ko sanjay raut ne maharashtra kii raajnneetik halchal ke bich twit kiya, ‘
 
 laharon ko darkar nauka paar nahin hoti, koshish karne waalon kii kabhi haar nahin hoti’
 But Sanjay Raut made some mistake while writing these lines, because he gave credit to Harivansh Rai Bachchan for this
 haalanki, ye kavita kii pankti harivansh raay bachchan kii nahin he, balki sohanlal dvivedi kii hai
 Many times Amitabh Bachchan has spoken this poem in Kaun Banega Crorepati and has also clarified that he is not his father's lines
 "laharon se dar kar nauka paar nahin hoti,koshish karne waalon kii kabhi haar nahi hoti 
 'bachchan
 ham honge kaamyaab
 
 jarur honge

 Former Supreme Court Justice Markandey Katju, who has often been in the news due to his comments on social networking sites and blogs, has now sparked a new controversy by calling freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak a British agent
 katju ne apane blog 'satyam bruyat- justise katju' main ek lekh main is baat kaa zikr kiya he
 Parkatju, the death anniversary of Lokmanya Tilak, on his blog that the whole country considers Tilak a great fighter but he does not agree to it
 unhone likhaa- 'mujhe pataa he ki log mujhase sahamat nahin honge or iske liye mujhe gaaliyaan bhi denge, lekin mujhe isse fark nahin padataa
 To me, Tilak was a conservative, extremist Hindutva pracharak and a British agent like Mahatma Gandhi
 unki vichaardhaara, bayaan or kaary bitrain kifut daalo or raaj karowali niti se prerit lagate hai
 Katju claimed some special stories: 1
 1894 main tilak ne maharashtra ke kai hisson main ganesh kii pratimaaon ko ghar-ghar sthapit karavaaya or saarvajanik puja samaaroh karwaae
 These appealed to Hindus to protect cows and not participate in Muharram
 isi tarah unhone 1895 main shivaji festival yojit kiya tha
 2
 1891 main jab british shashan ne shaadi kii umr 10 saal kii bajaay 12 karne kaa prastaav laayaa to unhone iskaa bhi is aadhaar par virodh kiya tha ki yah hindutv ke khilaaf he
 3
 1896 main jab bombai se lekar pune tak plig kaa prakope failaa tha tab british sarkaar ne saare gharon main dhuaan dekar bacteria ko maarane kaa prastaav rakhaa to tilak ne yah kehete hue iskaa virodh kiya ki isse hindu mahilaon kii pardaa pratha par aanch aegi
 4
 tilak ne ek or rudhivaadee vamoorkhtapurna theoridete hue kaha tha ki aaryon kaa asal kshetra arctic main tha
 5
 chah saal tak burma kii mandley jail main band rahane ke baad tilak puri tarah british agent kii tarah kaam karne lage
 Even he supported the recruitment of Indians in the British Army in the First World War
 iske alaava montegue chamsford sudhaaron kaa bhi samarthan kiya
 6
 mahatma gandhi or bal gangadhar tilak donon ne angrejon ke hiton ko puraa karne ke liye kaam kiya
 Whether they continue to get some money for this or not
 lekin unhone kaam british sarkaar ke liye hi kiya
 The festival of Raksha Bandhan is one of the major festivals of the Hindu religion, which is celebrated with pomp and enthusiasm throughout the country
 yah tyohaar bhai-bahan ke atoot rishte, beintahaan pyaar, tyaag or samarpan ko darshata he
 On this day, sisters tie Rakhi or Raksha Sutra on the wrist of their brother and wish him a long life and happiness
 rakshabandhan ke dauraan tiktaoc par kai aise video viral ho rahe hai, jisko khub share or pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 Somewhere the sister beat up the brother and somewhere the brother made a funny video and made everyone laugh

 The girl's family beat her to death
 mritak kii premika shaadishuda he
 The police have registered a case in this regard and arrested the accused
 ghatana barmer jile ke giraab thana kshetra kii he
 Where 36-year-old Sheeni Dan Kaprem, a resident of Baleba village, was walking with a 32-year-old married woman living in Prasangkharchi village
 mahila ke parijanon ko is bare main pehle se hi jaankaree thi
 So all those people were very angry with Sheeni
 police ke mutabik kuch dinon pehle peedit or mahila ne milane kaa plan banaaya tha
 Due to which Sheeni sneaked into the house of the woman last night
 mahila ke parijanon ko is baat kii bhanak lag gai
 He caught Sheeni red-handed with the woman and then lynched the woman's lover Sheeni
 kisi vyakti ne is baat kii soochna police ko de di
 Police reached the spot and took Sheeni to a hospital in an unaccompanied condition, where he died

 com / l2ntagcewj Students of BHU have been giving protest in front of the Chancellor's residence since 14 days
 There is no objection to teaching Sanskrit as a language, there is a new trend in the controversy over the teaching of Sanskrit by a Muslim teacher in Banaras Hindu University (BHU) of Uttar Pradesh
 
 abhi tak ye mana ja rahaa tha ki BHU ke chaatr kisi gaiyr hindu professor dwaara sanskrit padhaaye jane ke khilaaf hai, lekin hakeekat ye he ki chaatro kaa virodh is baat par he ki koi bhi professor jo ki hindu naa ho, vah hindu dharm samskruti or vigyaan ke bare main kaise padhaa saktaa he
 Know: What is the whole matter
 Actually, Banaras Hindu University has two departments, one of which belongs to the Sanskrit language, Hindi department and the other is a separate department made up of the Department of Sanskrit Science, Religion Science
 in donon main alag-alag tareeke kii padhai hoti he
 Sanskrit is taught as a language in the Sanskrit department
 vahiin, sanskrit vidya dharm vigyaan vibhaag main sanathan dharm ke reeti-rivaajon, mantron, shlokon, puja paath ke taur-tareekon or puja paath ke bare main bataaya jaataa he
 Students say that how a Muslim person can tell, teach, and teach about Hindu religion worship
 chaatro kaa virodh isi baat par he
 He says that he has no objection to Sanskrit being taught as a language by a teacher of any caste or religion
 apni isi baat ke aadhaar par BHU ke chaatr pichley 14 dinon se kulapati ke awaas ke saamne dharna de rahe hai
 He says that until these Muslim Professor Feroz Khan is transferred to another department, his opposition will continue
 is maamle main kulapati karyaalay se pehle hi saaf kiya ja chukaa he ki firoz khan kii niyukti saare niyam or kaayade-kanoon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 Feroz Khan had the highest number of points during selection, he has been appointed on the same basis
 lihaaja kulapati firoz khan ke chayan ko lekar apni baat par bane hue hai
 On the other hand, students have continued to protest by placing poster banners in front of the Chancellor's residence
 is bare main abhi tak kulapati se chaatro kii koi sarthak baatcheet nahin ho pai he or lagaataar virodh bana hua he

 ) jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main pichley dinon hue aantki hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 This attack has shaken the country
 is hamale ke baad vipaksh dal pulavama kii ghatana ko lekar phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahe hai
 In fact, the opposition on the surgical strike was expensive to raise questions, in view of this, the opposition seems to be surviving instead of surrounding the Modi government on the Pulwama attack
 pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad sattadhari bijepi se lekar tamaam vipakshi dal ekamat hai or sarkaar va suraksha agenciyon ke har kadam kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that the government and the army are with every step on this issue
 aatankiyon ko aisa sabak sikhaaya jaae ki dobaaraa ve aisi ghatana karne se pehle sochen
 With this, he said that he will not talk politically for the next few days
 vahiin, priyanka gandhi ne bhi apane lakhanu daure ke aakhri din press conference ko sthagit kar diya tha
 Not only the Congress, all the parties from the opposition parties are not raising any questions about the Pulwama attack
 jabaki pulavama hamale par pradhanmantri narendra modi se lekar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah apni chunavi reliyon main lagaataar is mudde par baat kar rahe hai
 In fact, surgical strikes are believed to be the biggest reason for the silence of opposition parties
 uri ke aatanki hamale ke baad sena ne pakistan main aadhi raat ko sargical strike kiya tha
 During this time, the Indian Army entered into pok and killed Pakistani soldiers and terrorists
 modi sarkaar ne uttar pradesh ke 2017 vidhansabha chunaav se ain pehle is sargical strike ko saarvajanik kar diya tha
 The surgical strike was presented as a celebration by the BJP and publicized by hoarding across the country
 congress samet tamaam vipakshi dalon ne sargical strike ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye the or kaha tha ki chunavi phaayde ke liye modi sarkaar sargical strike kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 All BJP leaders, including Narendra Modi, had shown tough attitude on the question of opposition parties on the surgical strike
 iske alaava unhone vipaksh ko hi sawaalon ke ghere main laa diya tha
 In such a situation, after the terrorist attack of Pulwama, the opposition is blowing every step
 yahi vajah he ki vipakshi modi sarkaar par jaij sawaal karne se bhi batch rahi he
 While the BJP was in opposition, the Manmohan government was fiercely surrounded by terror attacks

 You said they threw stones when you were 15 men, couldn't you catch them? If you get hurt by the stone, how far will the man who was stoned be
 yah kahani thodi jaldbaaji main bana di
 It would have been a little better if you had made it easy
 yah kahani mujhe janchati nahin he
 It is a murder in custody
 kanoon kahata he ki jaanch karo or jaanch nishpaksh honi chahie
 This investigation may not be against them, but how this thing happened, where it started, everything will come out in the investigation, so it is very important to have an investigation
 duusari baat, yah kisne kah diya ki aropiyon ne balaatkaar kiya tha
 The police is saying this and the accused said this in front of the police
 police kii hiraasat main kisi se bhi, koi bhi jurm kabool karaayaa ja saktaa he
 It was not yet proved that he had raped
 ve sabhi kam umr ke the
 They were also someone's children
 aapane unki jaanch kar lee, mukadmaa chalaa liya or maar bhi diya
 With regard to police action in Hyderabad, the question of whether the courts are irrelevant is arising
 aapaki kya raay he? ares sodhi ne jawaab dete hue kaha,police adalati kaarywahi ko apane haath main le le to uskaa kadam kabhi jaij nahin ho saktaa he
 If the police go against the law, then they are also accused as they are
 uskaa kaam sirf jaanch karnaa he or jaanch main mili tathyon ko adaalat ke saamne rakhana he
 In this, the defendant is also told that there are allegations against you and if you have anything to say in your explanation, then say it
 agar prativaadee ko apni begunaahi sabit karne kaa mauka nahin diya jayega or goli maar di jaaegi, ho saktaa he ki kisi or mulk main aisa insaaf hota ho, lekin hamaare samvidhan ke mutabik yah insaaf nahin he, isliye yah talibani insaaf kahin or ho saktaa he
 Not in this country
 police muthbhed ko lekar ucchtam nyaayalay ne disha-nirdesh tay kar rakhe hai
 Every encounter is also investigated under their purview, but even then why not change the perspective of suspicion on the police? RS Sodhi said, after the encounter, the suspicion of the police has not changed till date because the police has not changed
 hiraasat main maut hui he to agency jaanch karegi ki kahin aapane hatya to nahin kar di
 If you have committed murder, then you will be punished
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke disha-nirdesh hai ki bilkul swatantra jaanch honi chahie
 After this, whatever action will come, further action can be taken
 rashtriya aparaadh record beuro (enciarabi) kii ek report ke mutabik, 2017 main desh main dushkarm maamalon main doshasiddhi kii dar bahut kam 32
 Was 2 percent
 dushkarm ke 70 fisadi maamalon ke nyaayik pranali main upekshit rah jane ko aap kis tarah dekhte hai? ares sodhi ne kaha,kareeb 33 fisadi doshasiddhi or 67 fisadi ko bari kiya gaya he to iskaa yahi matlab he ki ve nirdosh the
 Why don't you look at it with the view that the innocent are also being implicated
 yah aap maanane ko taiyaar kyon nahin hai? agar kanoonee prakriya kaa paalan kiya gaya he or iske baad bhi 60 fisadi aaropee chhot jate hai to ve begunaah the, isliye chhot gaye
 As far as the police are concerned about not doing their job properly, it does not mean that the accused should be shot
 iske liye jaanch agency ko majboot kiya jaae
 He should be trained properly
 marpet se aparaadh kabool karaayaa gaya he to iske aadhaar par doshasiddhi ho hi nahin sakati he
 The investigation will be correct and if the right facts come before the court, then the court will give a decision in a fair manner
 adaalat dabaav main kaam nahin kar sakati he
 After the Nirbhaya case, the law was changed and the punishment for the culprits was provided for execution, even the rules regarding the minor changed, but even after this, why the cases of rape are not controlled
 ab bhi sudhaar kii gunjaaish kahaan-kahaan he? jawaab dete hue ares sodhi ne kaha, kanoon kitne chaahe bana len, jab tak isko lagu thik se nahin kiya jayega tab tak kuch nahin hoga
 Unless the process of investigation and conviction and imposition of punishment is expedited, there will be no fear of law in anyone's mind
 kanoon bhi khauf ke saath hi chalata he
 According to me the cases are not increasing but are getting more exposed which is a good thing

 UP Shia Waqf Board Chairman Syed Wasim Rizvi alleged that Pakistan is not only promoting the dispute but is also funding to pour ghee into the fire

 Pakistan has been continuously funding the clerics to promote enmity between the parties involved in the case
 pakistan kaa makasad he ki maulavee hindu or muslimon ke bich tanaav barkaraar rakhen or isse bharat main ashaanti faili rahe
 Chairman Syed Wasim Rizvi reiterated the demand of Muslims to withdraw their land from the disputed land
 isse pehle bhi shiya vakf board ne supreme court main halafanama daayar kiya tha
 The Shia Waqf in the affidavit had said that a Ram temple should be constructed at the disputed site in Ayodhya
 iske alaava masjid kaa nirmaan paas ke muslim bahulya ilaake main ho
 While the Sunni Waqf Board does not agree with this opinion of the Shia Waqf Board
 shiya vakf board vivaadit jagah par mandir banaae jane kii baat khule taur par kahata rahaa he
 In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Shia Waqf Board, the chairman of the board, Wasim Rizvi, said that if both the temple and the mosque are built at the disputed site, then there will be a possibility of conflict in the two communities
 isse bachaa janaa chahie
 Wasim Rizvi said that he is also going to Kashmir to meet the Muslims of the valley
 vahaan bhi vah musalamaanon ke bich babari masjid ko lekar ek raay banane kii koshish karenge

 sunni vakf board se baatcheet par rizvi ne kaha ki sunni vakf board ne na kabhi koi faisla mana he or na hi vah unase baat karne ja rahe hai
 Formation of mosque construction has been made in the Muslim-dominated area in collaboration with other parties
 haq jataa chuke hamrizvi ne kaha tha ki uske paas 1946 takavivaadit jameenka kabja tha or shiya ke mutvalli hua karte the, lekin british sarkaar ne is jameen ko sunni vakf board ko transfar kar diya tha
 The Shia Waqf Board said in the Supreme Court that it was in favor of a peaceful resolution of the dispute
 board ne kaha ki babari masjid banavaane vaala mir baki bhi shiya tha
 That is why it becomes our first right
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main aek baar phir shiya vakf board ne supreme court main halafanama daayar karke apana hastakshep pesh kiya he
 At the same time, Sunni Waqf Board and Babri Masjid Action Committee were advocating on behalf of Muslims

 upi ke gajiabad ke muradanagar ke ek gaanv main mahila se teen yuvakon ne tamanchey ke bal par gangrape kiya
 The victim is said to be the mother of four children
 police ne cese darj karke maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 No accused has been arrested so far
 police ke mutabik,muradanagar thanashetra ke ek gaanv main rahane vaali mahila somvaar kii shaam khet main pashuon ke liye chaara lene gai thi
 Here three youths caught him and gang-raped him
 virodh karne par yuvakon ne usko marpet kar ghayal kar diya he
 His gold earrings were also looted
 mahila ne ek yuvakka naam bataate hue teen logon ke khilaaf thane main taharir di he
 Station in-charge Umaid Yadav said that the report has been lodged
 jaanch ke baad hi sahi tasviir saamne aegi
 Police has sent the woman for medical examination
 samvidhan ne haq to sabko baraabar diya he lekin us haq ko hasil karnaa sabake liye baraabar nahin he
 Meaning if you are poor, do you get justice on time, or do the rich get justice fast? nyaay ilaaj kii tarah pehle se mahangaa hua he
 According to the India Justice Report, it takes an average of 5 years to settle a case in subordinate courts of India
 23 lakh cese aise hai jo 10 saal se lambit hai
 It is fine that India has made progress in the case of pending cases but the average of 5 years is very high
 wo bhi sirf nichali adaalat ke str par
 According to the Public Health Foundation of India, five and a half crore Indians are pushed into poverty every year due to expensive treatment
 neshnal stastical offis kaa aankada bhi isaki pushti karata he
 Between July 2017 and June 2018, a survey of over 1 lakh households found that 97 percent of hospital expenses were being paid by themselves
 ayushmaan bharat iske baad kii yojana he lekin uske pehle bhi kai rajyon main swasthya beemaa kii policy thi tab bhi yahi haalat he
 They have not benefited
 beemaari ke kaaran log mar bhi rahe hai or garib bhi ho rahe hai
 When the Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1950, Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar ne kaha tha ki ham antarvirodhon se bhare jivan main pravesh kar rahe hai
 We have equality in politics and there will be unevenness in social and economic life
 raajnneeti main ham ek vyakti ek vot or ek vot ek mat ke siddhant kaa paalan karenge
 But in our social and economic structure, we will not follow the principle of one man one vote
 ham kab tak antarvirodhon ke is jivan ko jite rahenge? ham kab tak apane saamaajik or aarthik jivan main samanta se inkaar karte rahenge? agar ham lambey samay tak isse vanchit rahe ham apane raajnneetik loktantr ko sankat main daal lenge
 We must remove these contradictions as soon as possible, or those who are victims of this inequality will destroy the structure of political democracy
 kai logon ko lagata he ki bharat main jati or dharm ko lekar nafrat samaapt ho gai he unhen bataaya janaa chahie ki pichley hafte tamilnadu main ek maa ne apni 17 saal kii beti ko jala diya kyonki vah anusuchit jati ke ladke se shaadi karnaa chaahati thi
 Her mother burnt her six months before she was 18 years old
 baad main maa ne bhi khud ko aag laga lee
 Due to love, many incidents of burning each other on the basis of caste and religion keep on coming every other day
 lagata hi nahin he ki ham kisi sanvaidhanik vyavastha main rah rahe hai
 The waste of caste that is in our mind as long as it exists is a dishonor to the soul of the Constitution
 jisaki prastaavna main bandhutav kii baat he
 The specialty of our constitution is that at one place it seems to be in contempt, then there is a place where one is silently following it
 jin netaaon par ham sabase zyaada samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan udaane ke aarope lagaate hai vahi aaj sansad main do tarah se samvidhan diwas manaa rahe the
 The opposition boycotted the joint session on the occasion of Constitution Day
 vipaksh kaa aarope tha ki maharashtra main samvidhan kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Democracy is killing
 dow
 Sonia Gandhi stood in front of Ambedkar's statue and read the Preamble of the Constitution
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, gulam nabi azaad or anya vipakshi dalon ke saansad the
 mps from TMC, DMK, SP NCP and Shiv Sena also read the Preamble to the Constitution
 duusari taraf bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ne sadan ke bheetar samvidhan diwas manaaya
 The Modi government has given the form of Constitution Day, before which it has been celebrated as Law Day
 2014 ke baad se samvidhan diwas ek pramukh diwas bana he
 The President addressed the joint session without opposition
 unhone samvidhan main die gaye kartvy or adhikaar kaa ullekh kiya
 The constitution gives us the fundamental right to freedom of expression, but it also tells citizens that it is their duty to protect public property and to abstain from violence
 2014 ke baad abhivyakti kaa adhikaar to rahaa lekin is adhikaar ke tahat asahmati vyakt karne waalon ko deshdohi or pakistani kehane kaa chalan bhi shuru hua
 The Prime Minister said that the Constitution is a book of texts
 yah acchhee baat he
 India is superior due to the strength of the constitution
 pradhanmantri ne bhi bagaiyr vipaksh ke sanyukt adhiveshan ko sambodhit kiya
 As stated earlier, at one place the constitution seems to be in crisis and at other places the constitution seems to be recovering from the crisis
 maharashtra kii hi do tasviir is baat kii tasdik kar detii he
 In the first picture, Devendra Fadnavis is taking oath before eight o'clock on Saturday morning
 unke saath ensipi ke vidhayak ajit pavaar up mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le rahe the
 The politics of Maharashtra reverses overnight and only one news agency, ANI, records this incident
 janata ke paise se chalane vaale doordarshan kii team bhi nahin he yahaan
 After this news, Prime Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar congratulate and the press praises Chanakya policy rather than questioning it
 yah tasviir kisi jatke se kam nahin thi
 Home Minister Amit Shah also tweets and congratulates them both
 maatr 80 ghante ke bheetar yah tasviir puraani ho jaati he jise master stroke kah kar prachaarit kiya ja rahaa tha
 The media's job was to raise questions about constitutional procedures, while many journalists on Twitter were praising the mast stroke
 is tasviir ko dekhie
 Devendra Fadnavis is submitting his resignation to the Governor in the evening
 istipha saunpane se pehle press conference karte hai
 We do not hold press conferences before taking oath, but the press is kept oblivious
 istipha dene se ek din pehle bagaiyr mantrimandal ke faisle lete hai
 Policy decisions are taken when the confidence of the House was not achieved
 kya yah sanvaidhanik naitikta thi? unke saath up mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene vaale ajit pavaar bhi istipha de dete hai
 The incident in Maharashtra was about to inflame the constitution in 80 hours, but during this time it was also being tested
 hamaare rajaneta samvidhan kaa paalan tab karte nazar aate hai jab mauka unke haath se nikal jaataa he
 When there is no way out
 bihar ke up mukhyamantri susheel modi kaa ek twit aaj ke din yaad kiya janaa chahie
 Was his tweet in favor of constitutional decorum when the question arose about the oath of Chief Minister's office without telling anyone in the morning
 aisa kab hua he ki shapath lene ke baad duniya ko pataa chalaa ki mukhyamantri hua he
 Generally, it used to be that first it was known then there was an oath
 ek se ek raajnneetik sankaton ke bich yahi hua he
 'those who are mourning the process of lifting President's rule in Maharashtra and the formation of a new government at night should know that India got independence at midnight
 union jaik raat main utaara gaya tha
 The Shakti of Shakti in Navratri and the ritual of Lakshmi Puja in Deepawali occur at night
 samskruti or itihaas se kate log janata se kya judenge
 'this was a tweet of a Deputy Chief Minister
 do sahi chizon ko milakar ek galat ko sahi bataane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 The incident which Sushil Modi was associating with the declaration of independence and the ritual of Lakshmi became chronic within 80 hours
 bijepi ke paas bahumat nahin tha
 After resigning on oath, Fadnavis said that the BJP would not attempt to form a government
 yahi baat unhone shapath ke pehle bhi kahi thi
 The question was not about time, it was a question of oath in secret
 aisa kya tha ki ek mukhyamantri pehle shapath letaa he or janata ko baad main khabar kii jaati he
 Therefore, if our constitution is in crisis, it seems to be recovering
 ubar aata he iskaa matlab yah nahin sankat khatm ho gaya he
 The Governor has a constitutional post
 tripura ke rajyapal tathagat raay ke twit ko samvidhan diwas ke din yaad kiya janaa chahie
 'I agree with an appeal of a retired colonel not to go to Kashmir
 kashmir emporium yaa sardiyon main aane vaale kashmiri vyapaaree se saamaan na khariden
 Boycott everything related to Kashmir
 ( 19 farvari 2019)''2015 main kisi ne twit kiya ki hinduon kii fiting spirit kahaan he to rajyapal mahoday jawaab dete hai ki ek apwaad tha gujarat 2002 kaa
 "multiculturalism in Europe is like secularism of India
" iskaa matlab he ki musalmaan apane reeti rivaajon par ade rahenge or baakiyon ko edjust karnaa padegaa
 "lincoln waged a civil war to prevent the partition of his country, why Congress could not do it
" wo bhi bantwaare ke liye utane hi zimmedaar hai
 At the time of Rohingya case, tweeted that Myanmar has discretion, we have secularism
 yani ve ek samudaay ke maare jane kaa samarthan kar rahe the
 'the fraternity talked about in the Preamble of the Constitution shows violation in his tweet many times
 khud inke twit se kai baar kendriya mantri asahmati zaahir kar chuke hai lekin tathagat raay usee pad par virajman hai
 It states that in violation of the constitution, one can continue in the constitutional post or while in the constitutional post, one can violate the principle of fraternity given in the constitution
 yahaan yaad karnaa chahie ki supreme court main aadhaar maamle main sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par mukul rohtagi ne kaha tha ki nagarikon kaa unke sharir par sampurna adhikaar nahin he
 Just after that, the Supreme Court gave a grand verdict on the fundamental right to privacy and told the government its limits
 yahi mukul rohtagi court me kah rahe the ki court rajyapal ko aadesh nahin de saktaa ki floor test kab hoga
 Knowing that the court has given orders many times
 or court ne aisa hi kiya
 Ordered floor test in Maharashtra
 jaisaa ki maine kaha jab bhi lagata he ki samvidhan kaa paalan ho nahin ho rahaa he usee vakt kisi or jagah samvidhan kaa paalan ho rahaa hota he
 Now you see pradhanmantri daltonganj ke jis manch se bhaashan de rahe hai us manch par 130 karod ke dawa ghotaale kaa aaropee bhi he or ek doosraa ummidavaar bhi jis par apane skool kii wardan kii hatya kaa aarope he
 BJP has given tickets to Bhanu Pratap Shahi and Shashi Bhushan Mehta
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki congress yaa vipaksh ne samvidhan kii aatma ke hisaab se ummidavaaron ko tikat die hai
 it's not like that at all
 lekin pradhanmantri kii kya majaburi rahi hogi ki unke saath 130 karod ke dawa ghotaale kaa aaropee khadaa he wo bhi samvidhan diwas ke ek din pehle
 Overall, the message for everyone on Constitution Day should be that we have to make all the systems strong and accessible to all
 apatkaal zarur sharmnaak ghatana he lekin aisa nahin he ki saamaanya dinon main apatkaal kii aahat or ashanka sunai nahin detii he balki kai baar thos pramaan bhi dikhte hai
 It should not happen that the Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa should make a separate comment in the case of the Prime Minister's rally, then the investigation against his family should begin and the positions where he has been on
 media main is sambandhit kai khabaren chap chuki hai
 During the election campaign, when an election observer Mohammad Mohsin examines the helicopter of the Prime Minister, he gets transferred
 mohammad mohsin iees afasar hai or unhen nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 Stayed in Mohsin's case and would like to tell you that Kat is going on trial in this case
 isi 31 aktubar ko aakhri sunwaayee hui he
 The Election Commission has also filed a case in the High Court against cat's stay
 jaisaa ki maine kaha ki ek jagah par samvidhan kamazor hota hua dikhataa he to duusari jagah par samvidhan manjboot hota hua dikhataa he
 It is the strength of the constitution that from the Prime Minister to the common man, it shows its faith
 'aaj agar baba sahab hote unhen ati prasannataa shaayad hi kisi ko hoti ki bharat ke itane varshon main na keval unke sawaalon kaa uttar diya he balki apane azaadi ko loktantr ko or samrudh or shashakt kiya he
 And so today, on this occasion, i proudly remind everyone of the legislature and the executive and judiciary, who have kept the spirit of the Constitution intact in the last seven decades
 is tarah ke prayaas kiye hai to deshavaasiyon ne milakar ise asafal kiya he or samvidhan par aanch aane nahin diya he
 'this thing of the Prime Minister is correct
 inhen sansthaaon main baithe logon ne samvidhan se khilwaad kiya to inhen sansthaaon main baithe logon ne ise bachaae rakhaa
 Even though their number was very less
 loktantr dainik abhyaas kaa system he
 Everyone has to practice every day to keep it up and saving
 varna raat ke andhere main satta jo khel khelti he, logon ke jaagane se pehle jo shapath hoti he vahi antim satya ho kar rah jaataa
 By resigning in the evening, there is no chance to fail that attempt
 ab aate hai maharashtra ke ghatnakram par
 What happened in the Supreme Court first
 supreme court ke justise envi ramana, justise ashok bhushan or justise sanjeev khanna kii teen jajon kii bench ne kaha ki loktantric mulyon ko banaae rakhane ke liye tatkaal bahumat pareekshan hona chahie
 Accepting the plea of shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, the court said that if the majority test is delayed then the action to protect democratic values comes in the way of obstruction before the court
 turant bahumat pareekshan aise maamle main sabase prabhavi tantra ho saktaa he
 a majority test is required as soon as possible to determine whether the chief minister, who has been sworn in, has a majority
 supreme court ne kaha ki ham rajyapal se anurodh karte hai ki 27 november ko vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaya jaae
 It also said that to maintain democratic values, right to good governance of citizens, it is necessary to pass an interim order for floor test to determine majority in Maharashtra
 adaalat ne sakht disha nirdesh bhi die ki ek antarim spikar yani protem spikar sirf vidhayakon ko shapath dilaane ke liye niyukt hoga shaam paanch baje se pehle sabhi ko shapath dilaai jaaegi
 There will be a floor test immediately after that
 koi gupt matdaan nahin hoga or bahumat pareekshan kaa sidhaa prasaaran kiya jayega
 More importantly, the court said that after three months, the court will also look into the constitutional validity of the Maharashtra Governor's decision to invite Fadnavis
 iske liye sabhi pakshakaron se aath hafte main jawaab maanga gaya he
 After this order of the Supreme Court, there was no option but to resign in front of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, because 162 parties of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress came together at a hotel in Mumbai on Monday night
 There was no possibility left
 pehle ajit pavaar ne upmukhyamantri pad se istifa saunpa
 Devendra Fadnavis resigned as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne fadanvis ne agali sarkaar banane tak fadanvis ko kaaryvahak mukhyamantri bane rahane kaa aagrah kiya
 Before resigning, Fadnavis held a press conference and said that the BJP had got the mandate to form the government
 lekin hamaare paas kuch siten kam rah gai thim
 Devendra Fadnavis said, 'he said that Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are three such parties whose views are completely different
 wo sirf bijepi ko baahar rakhane ke liye ek saath aae hai
 Their shared Minimum Program is just a hoax
 ajit pavaar ke paas samarthan patr tha lekin phir chizein badal gai
 Now BJP will become the voice of the people in the opposition
 'fadanvis ne yah nahin bataaya ki ajit pavaar ne jo samarthan patr saunpa tha us par kyon yakeen kiya, uskaa kya hua
 Now what will happen to Ajit Pawar if Ajit Pawar moves to another camp and forms government of NCP Shiv Sena and Congress
 un par lage 90 hazaar karod se adhik ke aaropon kaa kya hoga
 Will such people keep changing after saving themselves? fadanvis ke istife ke baad mumbai main rajbhavan main gatividhiyaan bad gayi
 The Governor administered oath to BJP MLA Kalidas Columbkar as the Protem Speaker
 kalidas columbukar wadala se aath baar vidhayak rah chuke hai or parampara he ki protem spikar ke liye sabase anbhavi or puraane vidhayak ko chunaa jaataa he taaki kisi tarah kaa koi vivaad na rahe
 The job of a Protem Speaker is only to administer oaths to legislators
 to protem spikar kalidas columkaar buudhvaar ko sabhi vidhayakon ko vidhayak pad kii shapath dilaayenge
 After this, the Congress held a press conference and said that Devendra Fadnavis, who was illegally sworn in, had to resign today
 hamen ummid he ki rajyapal swaarth se upar uthakar, sangh kaa apana mukhauta utarkar apni zimmedaariyon ko anjaam denge
 The Governor is expected to call on the alliance of Shiv sena-ncp-congress to form the government
 congress ke mutabik maamla yaheen khatm nahin hota he balki yahaan se shuru hota he
 The BJP has misused government machinery and power for years
 congress ne kaha ki fadanvis sarkaar jhooth kii buniyaad par bani thi or taash ke patton kii tah dhai gai
 This is not only the failure of Devendra Fadnavis but it is also a slap on the face of his rulers sitting in Delhi
 uddhav thakare maharashtra ke mukhyamantri honge
 He has been elected as the leader of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress mlas
 ek disambar ko shaam paanch baje wo mumbai ke shivaji park main shapath lenge
 He said that he will also call elder brother Narendra Modi in his swearing-in
 yani jo khabar shanivaar kii subah akhabaaron main chap kar juthi ho gai thi wo khabar mangalvaar kii shaam sahi ho gai
 a question must be raised today
 bharat main kanoon ke 4000 professor hai
 Law University has 26 Vice Chancellors
 har saal kanoon kii padhai padhakar 66000 chaatr nikalate hai
 It is true that many lawyers file pils and help the common people
 court main staff kii kami he or jajon kii puri sankhya nahin he
 The working place of lawyers is also not better
 kai kaarnon se aam logon ko nyaay sulabh nahin he lekin agar bhay ke kaaran nyaay nahin he to vah chintaa kii baat he
 Must see Judge Sahiban
 sunishchit karnaa chahie ki adaalat ke bheetar hinsa kii koi ghatana na ho
 You may have forgotten, but don't you remember this video? dilli police kii disipi monica bharadwaj ko tees hazari court ke parisar main vakeelon ne gher liya tha
 The ordinary soldiers of the police had saved their life by saving Monica Bhardwaj
 or monica bharadwaj is maamle main alag se cese tak darj nahin kara sakin
 Similarly, Kanhaiya Kumar and journalists were attacked in 2016 in Patiala court
 aaj tak karrwai nahi hui
 If the constitution weakens within the premises of the courts within a moment, then the courts should do something

 Yesterday it was relaxed by writing that the Indian poet society did not need any gross word like cleavage

 Scholars were searched again

 Read, looking for the Hindi word for cleavage: Part one is the second thing that the Hindi literature society is near revolution and progressivity in most of the cases, in such an aesthetic discourse it seems like some petty action

 Vijay Bahadur Singh gave a clue in the second conversation
 unhone kaha ki reeti kaal main iske liye ‘kuch bich’ shabd kaa prayog hua he
 And this usage has been used plurally in poetry in place of the inanimate word in the dictionary

 When Bihari's great-grandfather's word was found in Bihari, he was encouraged and Google moved from the custom to the Bhakti era

 'the poet of Ashtachhap is seen here with a garland lying on the neck of Gopi descending into the cleavage like two streams of Ganges
 vaise kuch bich shabd shringaarikta kii hadon ke paar bhi tatkaaleen sahitya main istemaal hua
 The use of the word Kuch Bich can also be seen in reference to the demonic worship in this verse sung in the raga Asavari in the context of devotion to Lord Krishna
 rup mohini dhari vraj ai 
 Wonderful Saji Singar Manohar, Asura Kans Da Paan Pathai

 yahaan itani kavayad main isliye kar rahaa hum ki ham us pravriti se batch saken jo parampara main jhanke bagaiyr hi angreji shabdon ke saamne lamb let ho jane kii he
 There is no prohibition of the words of the second language, but what is the harm in taking a peek at your house once
 vaise ek baat or ki kya 300 se 500 saal pehle istemaal kiya shabd ‘kuch bich’ sapaat bayani main kaam aa saktaa he

 Mizoram is one of the few states where the Congress is ruling
 yahaan par pichley 10 saalon se congress shashan main he
 The Congress President said that at the national level there is a fight of ideology between the BJP, the RSS and the Congress
 congress party kaa maananaa he ki bharat ko iske log chalaate hai or desh main vibhinn samskritiyon ko apni abhivyakti kii aazaadee honi chahie
 We believe that the country is strengthened through different culture and language and we also support it

 In the case of the massacre of 5 people belonging to a particular caste in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, the politics has started warming up
 is maamle main ab satta paksh ke hi do bade mantri aamane-saamne hai
 While Swami Prasad Maurya, the cabinet minister in the Yogi government, is still bent on criminalizing these dead in the tongue of the tongue, Law Minister Brijesh Pathak, in his gestures, hinted at action on Maurya itself
 darasal swami prasad maury ne kaha ki 'agar koi maarane aayega to uski aarti nahin utaari ja sakati
 Describing Maurya's statement, Brijesh Pathak said that under the conspiracy, efforts are being made to save the accused and action will be taken against those involved in saving the killers
 in bayanon se saaf he ki yogi sarkaar ke donon cabinet mantri is mudde par aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 Let us tell you that the SSP of Rae Bareli first named the incident as an accident, then the casualties were called the attackers, but after the post mortem report and the investigation of the scene, it was clear that these 5 people were first beaten in the village dispute
 He was killed and then his hands and feet were also burnt to make it look like an accident
 is nrushans ghatana ke baad raibareli ke espi ko hataa diya gaya or mukhyamantri neis hatyakandapar jaanch bithaane ke saath peedit pariwaron ke liye muaavje kaa bhi elaan kiya

 In fact, the budget session of the assembly is starting from July 11, where this brutal massacre is likely to be a headache for the government too, as the Brahmin mlas of all the parties are busy in encircling the government on this issue
 aise main maamle ko badhata dekh keshav prasad maury ne bhi kaha he ki is nrushans hatyakand ko anjaam dene waalon ko bakhsha nahin jayega

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes has made changes to the format of Form 16
 nae badlaavon ke baad form main pehle se kahin zyada jaankaree darj hogi
 With the new Form 16, those filing online income tax returns will get the facility
 form 16 main hue in badlaavon kaa uddeshy visheshgy pratyaksh kar se jude aankadon main ekarupata laana bataa rahe hai
 First understand what is Form 16? This form is given by an employer to his employee
 isamen vitt varsh ke dauraan di gai selleri or kaate gaye tex kii jaankaree hoti he
 Form 16 has two parts
 port e main niyokta or karmchaaree kii ditels hoti hai
 For example, name, PAN number, address etc
 vahiin duusare hisse main vetan or tex kii jaankaree hoti he
 What new changes this year, when your employer will be given Form 16, then some new heads will be added to it
 masalan, selary ke alaava agar aapako kisi anya strot se aay hui he to isaki jaankaree form 16 main hogi
 For example, remuneration received in lieu of rent income or advice given to another institution
 saath hi sabhi tarah ke karmukt bhatton kii jaankaree bhi form 16 main deni hogi jaise, altie, echaare aadi
 Apart from this, if a worker has saved tax under 80C, his information will also be given in Form 16
 yani kul milakar nayaa form 16 pehle se zyada jaankaree apane andar samete hoga
 Income tax returns have to be filled Easily, jobless people need Form 16 to fill their income tax returns
 ab tak form 16 main anya sroton kii aay na hone ke kaaran ritern bharte samay form 16 ke alaava bhi karadaata ko anya ditels (agar hai to) bhi daalani padati thi
 But this will not happen after the new changes in Form 16
 yadi koi karadaata online apana inakam tex ritern bhar rahaa he or usne apane niyokta ko sabhi jaankariyaan sahi di hai to system apane-aap form 16 se sabhi jaankariyon ko nikaal legaa
 This information will be automatically recorded in the income tax return form
 is tarah form 16 ke nae praaroop ke baad inakam tex ritern filing aasaan ho jaaegi
 Why the need for change? Tax expert Ankit Gupta says, "after these changes, there will be uniformity in the data related to direct tax
 ’’ ab tak agar form 16 ke hisaab se or inakam tex ritern file karne ke lihaaj se kar ke aankade milaae jate hai to unamem antar hota he jo laazmi bhi he
 Because at the time of filing income tax return, taxpayers used to file additional information even after Form 16
 lekin nae praaroop ke baad tex ritern aankadon main ekarupata laai ja sakegi
 July 31 is the last date for filing income tax returns
 sibidibi kii ore se vitt varsh 2018-19 kaa ritern bharne ke liye jaruri itiar form notiphoi kar die gaye hai

 In the Indian election system, a candidate has the freedom to contest from many seats
 lekin, ab chunaav ayog is prakaar kii vyavastha ko khatm karne kaa man bana chukaa he
 In the electoral reform process, the Election Commission has said in its recommendation to the Law Ministry that a candidate should not be allowed to contest from two seats
 chunaav ayog ne kendriya vidhi mantralay se sifarish kii he ki ek ummidavaar ke do siton se chunaav ladgaye kii praavdhaan ko samaapt kiya jaae
 Apart from this, the Election Commission has also sent some more amendments to the Union Law Ministry
 chunaav ayog ke anusaar abhi tak ek pratyaashee ko do siton se chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar he or donon sitane jeetne par ek seat chhodane kii vyavastha bhi he
 It is noteworthy that before 1996, the candidate could contest any number of seats
 ayog ne kaha ki yadi sarkaar is praavdhaan ko banaae hi rakhana chaahati he to upachunaav kaa kharch uthaane kii jimmedaari seat chhodane vaale ummidavaar par daali jaae
 In the case of by-elections to the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, the amount should be 5 lakh and in the Lok Sabha by-election the amount should be 10 lakh
 sarkaar ise samay-samay par badha sakati he
 The commission said that leaving a candidate's seat is an injustice to the voters
 iske alaava chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki saarvajanik dendariyon vaale laagon ko chunaav ladane se roka jaae
 In this regard, the Election Commission has also cited the order of Delhi High Court in 2015 which said that those who do not pay government bungalows, electricity, telephone, water, hotel, airline etc
 should be prevented from contesting elections
 chunaav ayog ne kaha ki upachunaav main seat chhodie vaale pratyaashee ko 5 lakh or loksabhaa ke liye 10 lakh ke kharch kaa vahan kare
 The commission said that this amount should also be increased from time to time
 kaale dhan par kaabo paane ke liye vimudrikaran ke elaan ke baad modi sarkaar kaa yah doosraa bada nitigat faisla hoga jiske bare main jald elaan kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 The Legislative Department of the Ministry of Law and Law has issued circulars in this regard to all the departments concerned, which is said to implement the recommendations of the Commission soon
 vidhi ayog ke do suzav gaur karne laayak hai

 The Election Commission has recommended to the Union Law Ministry that the provision for contesting elections from two seats of one candidate be abolished
 chunaav ayog ne iske alaava kuch or sanshodhan bhi kendriya vidhi mantralay ko bheje hai
 According to the Election Commission, so far a candidate has the right to contest from two seats and there is also a system of leaving one seat if both seats are won
 ullekhneey he ki 1996 se purv ummidavaar kitni bhi siton se lard saktaa tha
 The Commission said that if the government wants to keep this provision, then the responsibility of incurring the cost of the by-election should be put on the candidate leaving the seat
 vidhansabha va vidhanparishad ke upachunaav ke maamle main raashi 5 lakh or loksabhaa upachunaav main raashi 10 lakh honi chahie
 The government may increase it from time to time
 ayog ne kaha ki pratyaashee kaa seat chhodana votaron se anyaay ke samaan he
 Apart from this, the Election Commission has said that people with public liabilities should be prevented from contesting elections
 is bare main chunaav ayog ne 2015 main dilli hoicourt ke aadesh kaa hawala bhi diya he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki sarkari bangale, bijli, telephone, pani, hotel, airline aadi kaa bhugtan na karne vaale logon ko chunaav ladane se roka jaae
 The Election Commission said that the candidate who left the seat in the by-election should bear the expenses of 5 lakh and 10 lakh for the Lok Sabha
 ayog ne kaha samay samay par is raashi ko badhaayaa bhi janaa chahie
 This will be the second major policy decision of the Modi government after the announcement of demonetisation to control black money, which is likely to be announced soon
 vidhi or kanoon mantralay ke vidhayika vibhaag ne is bare main sambandhit sabhi vibhaagon ko paripatr jari kiya he, jisamen jald hi ayog kii siforishein lagu karne kii baat kahi gai he
 Two suggestions of the Law Commission are worth noting
 pehla, aise maamle jinamein kam se kam paanch saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he, chargeshit vaale netaa ko chunaav ladgaye kii anumati na ho
 Secondly, fast track courts will be set up to hear the cases going on against the leaders of political parties, who have to pronounce the verdict within a year
 fast trek court se sajaa paane vaale bhale hi upree adaalat se bari ho jaaen, lekin un par chunaav ladgaye, raajnneetik party banane or raajnneetik dal main padaadhikari banane par hameshaa ke liye roak lagaai jaae
 The comments bataa den ki chunaav sudhaar ko lekar beete dhai dashak se kavayad chal rahi he
 The Modi government has sought suggestions in this regard from the Law Commission
 chunaav ke dauraan ped news (paise lekar kisi ummidavaar ke paksh main khabar dikhaane yaa chhapane), state funding (ummidavaar kaa kharch sarkaar degi), jhuthe shapathpatr, kharch kaa byoraa kam bataane or aparaadhon main aaropee ummidavaaron ke chunaav ladgaye par roak lagane jaise muddon par sahmati banane ke prayaas chal rahe hai

 CISF Director General OP Singh said that the airports at Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai and Ahmedabad have been put on handbags or sealing tags
 tippaniyan The cisf's reasoning behind this rule is that this step will make the passengers' experiences enjoyable and provide them a simpler security environment
 suraksha bal ke karmchaaree is nai pranali ke liye taiyaar hai
 OP Singh said that paramilitary forces handle security at 59 airports across the country

 Yes, whatever is happening in the prison located in Kasna, Greater Noida, is not only tearing the prison manual apart, but also showing how deep the corruption in the system is embedded
 hairaani kii baat he ki kasana jail ko upi kii sabase aadhunik suvidhaon vaali jelon main se ek bataaya jaataa he
 But on the contrary, the way inmates are treated in this jail is a shame on the whole of humanity
 bhrashtachar kaa silsilaa jail ke daravaaje se hi shuru ho jaataa he
 It is alleged that the relatives who come to meet the prisoners have to first warm the fists of the staff of the jail
 phir jail ke andar bhi sahuliyaton ke naam par kaidiyon se vasuuli jaati he moti rakam
 If the prisoner is poor and cannot afford the money, then his ruthless beating is done so that the spectators of the spectators tremble
 lekin pitane vaale kaidiyon kii chikhen jail kii chahardivari se baahar nahin ja saktin, ye jail ke adhikariyon ko acchhee tarah pataa he
 Because of this, the process of fearless and illegal recovery continues
 jail ke hi ek purv kaidi ajay bholaram ne yahaan kii hakeekat ke bare main jo kuch bhi bataaya wo hosh uda dene vaala tha
 In this way, the pictures and videos from inside the prison can be seen clearly how the inmates are smoked like cotton
 ek video main jail ke purv dipti jailer akram khan ko ek kaidi ko ulataa lataka kar peetate dekha ja saktaa he
 Now Akram Khan has been transferred from this prison
 kaidiyon kii pitayee main shoorveer singh yadav naam kaa mukhya bandirakshak bhi peeche nahin
 Not only this, some of the wanted prisoners of the authorities have got license to beat other prisoners
 sahuliyat ke mutabik tay hota he recob aapako bataate hai ki jail main kis tarah chalata he paise ke dam par kaidiyon ko jail main sahuliyatein dene kaa khel
 Here the prisoner's pocket is thick, so he gets everything he wants
 'aaj tak' ko jail main suvidhaon kaa rate card bhi haath laga
 According to this, the price of subsidies goes to the jail - Vegetable - 400 rupees kilosigrate - 30 rupees a beer - 500 rupees sugar - 1000 to 3500 Rupees mobile - 10 thousand rupees before the inspection: Jailkasana jail has 3000 prisoners
 aarope ke mutabik har din jail main kam se kam ek lakh rupye kii avaidh kamai hoti he
 Moreover, the account of this earnings is also maintained through the registered register
 jail ke andar se aae ek video main baqayada anounsament bhi hote suna gaya ki inspection hone vaala he, isliye jiske paas paise, bidi, cigarette yaa koiapattijanak chizho use chupa de
 That is, if there are any big officers from outside for inspection in the jail, then before their arrival, everyone is caught in jail

 He was brought back home the next day when he was recovering
 lekin aaj subah phir se unki tabiyat kharaab ho gai
