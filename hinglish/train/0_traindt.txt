 a tweet made about Jagannath Puri's Rath Yatra amidst the debate over whether Rahul Gandhi called Congress a Muslim party or not, has brought the Congress down
 is saal puri kii prasidd jagannatha yatra 14 july ko shuru hui jo nau dinon tak chalegi
 From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, people greeted the commencement of the rath yatra
 lekin congress party ne jab puri kii jagannatha yatra ko lekar twit kiya to ek nahin balki do-do galtiyaan kar deen
 The first mistake is to write Lord Jagannath's sister Subhadra as his brother and second mistake is to write Gundicha Ghat to Gundicha Ghar
 Jagannath Yatra 1 of the oldest procession festivals, takes place at the Hindu Dham, Puri
 As Lord Jagannath takes his annual journey to his birthplace Gundicha Ghat with his brothers, it is in essence the journey of a man from ignorance to awareness, of equality & inclusiveness

 com / oakuwicd4v— Congress (@incindia)july 14, 2018congress ne twit kiya, ''jagannatha rathyatra sabase puraane juluus vaale tyoharon main se ek he jo har saal hindu dham, puri main yojit hoti he 
 Every year Lord Jagannath travels with his brothers to Gundicha Ghat, his birthplace
 yah asal main sabko saath lekar andhkaar se prakaash kii ore le jane vaali yatra he
 "actually, it is wrong for Lord Jagannath to go with his brothers because he had a brother and a sister
" puranic kathaon ke mutabik ye yatra bhagavan jagannatha apane bade bhai balbhadra or apni bahan subhadra ke saath karte hai
 The second mistake is for Gundia to write a ghat to a house or temple
 puri main gundicha ghat naam kii koi jagah he hi nahin
 Every year in the month of june-july, the Jagannath Rath Yatra begins at the Gundicha Ghar or Gundicha Temple, three kilometers away from the Jagannath Temple
 jagannatha mandir ke pujari ipshit pratihaari ke mutabik gundicha mandir bhagavan jagannatha kii mausi kaa ghar he jahaan rathyatra ke dauraan bhagavan jagannatha apane bhai balbhadra or bahan subhadra ke saath nau din rukate hai
 Many people on Twitter have commented about the Congress' mistake
 opindia
 a website named com has also made a detailed news about this, pointing out the mistakes
 Please be informed;lord Jagannath takes this annual journey with His Siblings ( Lord Balabhadra, brother and Debi Subhadra, sister )and it is Gundicha Ghara
 God is greathave a wonderful daythank You — SIDDHARTH MOHANTY (@ mithu772) July 14, 2018 Recently, the Congress social media department has made several mistakes
 kuch hi dinon pehle pradhanmantri modi ko jhootha sabit karne kii jaldi main congress party ne ek twit main apni pravaktaa priyanka chaturvedi ko tag karne kii jagah mashhoor adaakara priyanka chopra ko hi tag kar diya
 The Congress party's social media was ridiculed too much for this tweet
 usase pehle congress ne apane twitor handle se ek puraane video ko modi kii 7 july kii raily kii ghatana bataa diya
 In this video people were shouting slogans against Vasundhara
 lekin ye video darasal paanch maheene purana tha
 After fussing over this lapse, the Congress also had to be clarified

 isse pehle, din main manohar laal sharma ne pradhan nyaayadhish kii adhyakshata vaali khandpeeth ke samaksh yah maamla uthaaya tha

 Tiwari said, "it was only after the formation of the Modi government in 2014 that the process of regularization of 1797 unauthorized colonies started and the Urban Development Ministry has been writing letters in this regard and conveying it repeatedly, but the Delhi government on its part has unauthorized colonies
 Showed no interest in regularizing

 Issues like triple talaq have been a part of the wider debate within India for the past several decades
 ekataraf jahaan alag-alag partiyaan iske virodh main rahi hai
 So the women wing of organizations like jamaat-e-islami, which is active among Muslims, believes that more needs to be done for Muslim women suffering from triple talaq
 is mahila wing kaa maananaa he ki mahilaon ko twarit nyaay milane ke liye ulimaon ko bich kaa rasta nikaalnaa chahie
 Here, let us tell you that while Muslim organizations are adamant that there can be no compromise on triple talaq, there are some basic questions raised by women who are attached to the same organization
 jamaat-e-islamic hind kii mahila wing kar rahi koshishgauratlab he ki teen talaak, halaala or bahu vivaah ko lekar muslim sanghathanon kii mahilaayein pehle bhi sadak par utar chuki hai
 She is going door-to-door to make people aware of Islamic law and instructs people to avoid the misuse of triple talaq
 mahila wing kii mahilaayein is masale parmuslim samaajako jagaane ke liye prayasarat hai
 Women associated with this wing say that the awareness campaign started on April 23 on personal law has been very successful so far
 ve aage kahati hai ki 23 rajyon main jaagarukta kaarykram chalaae ja rahe hai

 is puure abhiyaan kii vishesh baat mahilaon kaa apane purush pradhan sanghathan se ek alag soch rakhana bhi he
 The opinion of these women is very clear that once divorced, it is illegitimate
 saath hi peedit mahilaon ke liye muslim samaaj or ulimaon ko kuch or behatar karnaa hoga
 What do the women associated with the jamaat-e-islami say? Shaista Rafat, head of the women's wing of the Jamaat in Haryana state, requests the Muslim Personal Law Board and the Ulema to divorce three divorces and demand justice for the oppressed women
 haalanki unka maananaa he ki teen talaak muslim samaaj ke bajaay media or sarkaar ke liye bada mudda he
 Atiya Siddika, a resident of Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly district and secretary of the Jamaat, says that there are many men here who have not searched their wives but left them just like that
 aise main vah in peedit mahilaon ke bare main bhi soche jane kii baat kahati hai
 Personal Law The Personal Case of Muslims
 
 
 is sanghathan se judi mahilaon kaa kahana he ki personal lau musalamaanon kaa nijee maamla he
 He got his right from the Constitution of India
 court yaa sarkaar ko isamen dakhal nahin dena chahie
 However, with the changing times and circumstances, the Ulama also talks about changing
 in mahilaon kaa maananaa he ki muslim samaaj ke bheetar teen talaak se aage bad kar bhi ashiksha or berogari jaise mudde hai
 The government also needs to move forward on these

 madhya pradesh main jagah jagah faile dalal nirakshar or apaatr gramin logon ko karj lene ke liye dabaav daal rahe hai
 India Today's investigation has revealed how the money is being collected from the rural people in the name of 'processing fees' for the loan which they never have to get

 pakistani pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ne guuruuvaar ko supreme court ke saamne pesh hokar avmaananaa maamle main apana paksh rakhaa

 Gilani has told the court that President Asif Ali Zardari is exempted from criminal matters on the basis of the constitution, which is why he did not write a letter to Swiss Bank
 gilaani ne kaha ki court kii avmaananaa karne kii kabhi soch bhi nahin sakate kyonki vah court kaa sammaan karte hai

 Now the next hearing will be held on February 1, but on that day the court has given permission to Gilani not to appear

 mumbai main salmaan khan kii film 'bajrangi bhaijan' kaa trailor jari kiya gaya
 The entire starcast of the film was present on this occasion
 yahaan salmaan kaafii hansi mazaaq ke mood main the or isi hansi mazaaq ke andaaz main media ke vivaadit sawaalon ko bhi nazar andaaz kar diya
 Salman Khan was coming to the media of Mumbai for the first time after the punishment and High Court relief in the hit and run case
 lihaaza salmaan se adaalat se jude sawaal poochne ke liye media bhi daant pajaye baithi thi or salmaan bhi jaanate the kii media kii taraf se adalati sawaalon kii bauchhaar hogi
 But the special thing is that Salman was more prepared than the media and it seems that he had come to decide to avoid these questions
 salmaan se jaise hi adaalat se jude sawaal puche jate, salmaan yaa to idhar udhar dekh kar nazarandaaz kar dete yaa phir hansate hue ye kahkar topic badal dete ki itnaa ghuma firaakar kyon puch rahe ho
 The comments jaise hi salmaan se poocha gaya ki is film ke dauraan adalati karwaai chal rahi thi to salmaan ko kis tarah kii mushkil hui? to salmaan ne is sawaal kaa jawaab bhi ghuma diya
 Cleverly, Salman said, 'it was very difficult during this film, but she was troubled by its director Kabir Khan because Kabir was repeatedly running from different locations to different locations for shooting
 ' That is, Babaq Salman, surrounded by controversies, has understood when and how much to speak
 hit and ran maamle main sazaa or hai court se raahat yani adalati chakkar ke baad pehali baar mumbai kii media se rubaru ho rahe the salmaan khan
 Therefore, the media was also gnawing at Salman to ask questions related to the court and Salman also knew that the court would be flooded with questions from the media
 lekin khaas baat ye he ki media se zyaada taiyaar baithe the salmaan or lagata he ki tay karke aaye the in sawaalon se bachane ke liye
 As soon as the questions related to the court were asked to Salman, Salman would either ignore it by looking around or change the topic by laughing as to why he was asking so much
 tippaniyan As soon as Salman was asked what kind of difficulty did Salman face during the course of the court proceedings? So Salman even turned the answer to this question
 badi chaturaai se salmaan ne kaha, 'bahut mushkil ai is film ke dauraan magar wo takaleef di iske nirdeshak kabir khan ne kyonki kabir baar-baar lokation badal-badal kar alag-alag jagah dauda rahe the shooting ke liye
 ' yani bebaak salmaan vivaadon main ghirte ghirte ye samaj chuke hai ki kab or kitna bolnaa he
 But the special thing is that Salman was more prepared than the media and it seems that he had come to decide to avoid these questions
 salmaan se jaise hi adaalat se jude sawaal puche jate, salmaan yaa to idhar udhar dekh kar nazarandaaz kar dete yaa phir hansate hue ye kahkar topic badal dete ki itnaa ghuma firaakar kyon puch rahe ho

 Kalyan Singh's Rashtriya Janakranti Party merged with the BJP on Monday
 vilay ke vakt bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari bhi maujuud the
 Even after suspension from the party, Rajya Sabha MP Ram Jethmalani again criticized Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Nitin Gadkari, including Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, and said that he was ready to be expelled from the party
 jethmalani ne nitin gadakari ko khat likhakar aarope lagaaya he ki ve siyaasi khudakushi ke raste par ja rahe hai or apane saath puri party ko bhi le ja rahe hai
 He said that whatever you do to me does not matter to me, because i am not in favor of the membership of Parliament for respect
 kisi bhi mudde par bolne ke adhikaar kaa daawa karte hue jethmalani ne kaha, vipaksh kaa matlab virodh ke naam par virodh karnaa hi nahin he
 i also understand the situation
 mujhe apni baat rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 Jethmalani was formally given notice on Monday and asked why he should not be expelled from the BJP due to anti-party activities
 gadakari ke mukhar virdohi rahe jethmalani ne kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) pramukh ranjit sinha kii niyukti par party ke nazariye kaa virodh kar bhaajapa ko asahaj sthiti main laa khadaa kar diya
 Jaitley and Sushma wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opposing the appointment of the CBI chief
 jethmalani ne kaha ki vah sinha kii niyukti kaa abhi bhi samarthan karte hai or sarkaar kaa yah kadam budhimaani bharaa he
 He said, for the change only, the Prime Minister did a good job by not making the tainted officer the CBI chief
 jethmalani ne kaha ki unke virodh kaa arth jetali evam sushamaa kii aalochana karnaa nahin he
 He said, where has the criticism of Jaitley and Sushma come in? At the same time Jethmalani also attacked Sushma and Jaitley and said that he would not accept unilateral orders
 jethmalani ne gadakari, sushamaa evam jetali par bhaajapa ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 "I am clear that his actions have damaged the image of the BJP in a big way, which has damaged the party," he said
 aaj aam aadmi kah rahaa he ki bhaajapa evam congress main koi antar nahin he
 The comments jab jethmalani se poocha gaya ki kya vah gadakari ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai to unhone kaha, sabhi teenon
 Especially to Gadkari
 main nishkasit hone ke liye taiyaar hum
 Jethmalani said that he has not yet received a show cause notice
 unhone kaha, yadi mujhe uttar dene ke liye kuch aisa he to main jawaab duungaa
 Otherwise i will tear it away
 mere liye 10 din ke andar notice kaa jawaab dena sambhav nahin he
 i am a busy lawyer and politician
 mujhe disambar ant tak kaa samay chahie
 Jethmalani has written a letter to Nitin Gadkari alleging that he is on his way to political suicide and taking the entire party with him
 unhone kaha ki aap meraa jo bhi karen usase mujhe fark nahin padataa, kyonki main izzat ke liye sansad kii sadsyta kaa mohataaj nahin hum
 Claiming the right to speak on any issue, Jethmalani said, opposition does not mean protest in the name of protest
 mujhe bhi vastusthiti kii samaj he
 i have the right to make my point
 jethmalani ko aupchaarik taur par somvaar ko notice diya gaya or poocha gaya ki unhen party virodh gatividhiyon ke kaaran kyon na bhaajapa se nishkasit kar diya jaae? Jethmalani, who has been a vocal opponent of Gadkari, opposed the party's view on the appointment of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) chief Ranjit Sinha and brought the BJP in an uncomfortable position
 jetali evam sushamaa ne sibiai pramukh kii niyukti kaa virodh karte hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko patr likhaa tha
 Jethmalani said that he still supports Sinha's appointment and the government's move is wise
 unhone kaha, parivartan ke liye hi sahi pradhanmantri ne daagi adhikari ko sibiai pramukh na banaakar acha kaam kiya
 Jethmalani said that his opposition does not mean criticizing Jaitley and Sushma
 unhone kaha, jetali evam sushamaa kii aalochana kii baat isamen kahaan aa gai? saath hi jethmalani ne sushamaa evam jetali par hamalaa bhi kiya or kaha ki vah ekapaksheeya aadesh nahin maanenge
 Jethmalani also accused Gadkari, Sushma and Jaitley of harming the BJP
 unhone kaha, main is vishay main spasht hum ki unke kaaryon ne bhaajapa kii chhavi ko vyapak str par nuksaan pahunchaaya he, jisase party kii kshati pahunchi he
 Today the common man is saying that there is no difference between the BJP and the Congress
 tippaniyan When Jethmalani was asked if he was targeting Gadkari, he said, all three
 gadakari ko khaastaur par
 i am ready to be expelled
 jethmalani ne kaha ki unhen abhi kaaran bataao notice nahin mila he
 He said, if i have something to answer, i will answer
 nahin to main ise faad ke phenk duungaa
 It is not possible for me to respond to the notice within 10 days
 main vyast vakil evam raajnneetijna hum
 I'd like an end of December
 kisi bhi mudde par bolne ke adhikaar kaa daawa karte hue jethmalani ne kaha, vipaksh kaa matlab virodh ke naam par virodh karnaa hi nahin he

 Modi surrounded the opposition on the pretext of Kovind, but the real target is somewhere else
 The most important aspect of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's politics is that Modi starts making lists from where the list of speculations ends

 The GST Council has fixed a tax slab of 12 per cent for the government to run its lottery

 Sex acts as a sweetener in your relationship
 ek healdi relationships ke liye ye kaaphi jaruri he
 Talking about the early years of marriage, the couple should have sex three to four times a week
 sirf sex hi nahin balki kabhi-kabhi unhen choote hue gale lagaana yaa phir unhen bahon main bhar lenaa bhi jaadu kaa kaam karata he
 Many times it happens that by having sex in one kind and one place, you start feeling boring
 aise vakt main chahie ki pyaar ke in palon main thodaa nayaapan laayaa jaae
 Bring freshness to stale and boring sexual life by inventing some new ways
 ye aapako betahasha anand degaa
 If you want, you can try some place other than home
 varanaa hi ghar main hi bath tub ke paas kaa romance bhi kuch kam aakarshak or aanandamay nahin hota
 Burn some candles around the bathtub and call them to you
 aise vakt par shampen yaa wine kaa lutf bhi uthaaya ja saktaa he
 The romance of the kitchen is also very special
 sexi shorts yaa tii-shart pahanakar unki pasandida dish banaaen
 Make some poses at this time so that their attention is attracted to you
 phir dekhie wo aapmen magan ho jaaenge
 Love in the rain brings even more freshness to your relationship
 agar barish main unke saath mauka miltaa he to paas ke park main jaakar romani palon kaa majaa liya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, you can do some loving pranks on shopping malls or other places
 kuch kapal to public librari main bhi jagah or mauka dhund lete hai
 But it is very important to remain silent at this time
 agar aap donon car main hai or kahin jam main funs gaye hai, to vahaan bhi kuch vakt nikaala ja saktaa he
 But avoid the eyes of those around
 iske alaava der raat kisi bade kambal main khud or unhen lapetakar chat par laayaa ja saktaa he
 This style of love will also have its own fun

 SP-BSP has joined hands to stop bjp's victory chariot in UP
 congress gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin hogi
 After the victory in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana, the claim has become stronger that the two parties together can stop the BJP in UP
 india today-karvi incit kaa survey bataata he ki agar congress bhi gathbandhan main shaamil hoti he to bijepi kaa vot share 2014 ke 43
 From 3% will come down to 36% but the seats it gets will be just 5 instead of 73
 baaki kii 75 siten bispi, espi, areldi or congress ke khate main chali jaaengi lekin is survey par bijepi ke pravaktaa kaa kahana he ki keval dalon ke milane se ganit nahin banataa, chemistry se tay hota he ki kisko kitni siten milengi
 He said that the basis of the survey should have been bigger
 gauratlab he ki ajtak kaa karvi incits ke saath ye survey 28 disambar se 8 janvari ke bich kiya gaya

 He also said where will Priyanka go if she does not join Congress
 congress ke pravaktaa rajeev tyaagi ne daawa kiya janata kaa vot transfar hokar congress ke paas aayega 2009, 2014 main congress akele ladi thi
 The factor of Priyanka and Scindia has not been included in this survey

 Despite this, the Congress is clapping
 sambit ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav main kaha gaya tha ki do ladke kamaal kar denge lekin kya hua
 His point was on Akhilesh and Rahul
 congress pravaktaa rajeev tyaagi ne kaha ki bijepi 2 siton par rahi to kya vah khatm ho gai
 If Priyanka is brought in, it will affect the election
 sambit ke kataaksh par unhone kaha ki main garv ke saath kahata hum ki main gandhi parivaar ke saath kaam karata hum
 On this, Sambit Patra said that he wants to perform the aarti if a photo of Gandhi family is brought

 ) Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Friday lashed out at the ruling party BJP over the issue of employment in Parliament
 rahul ne kaha ki endie ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle rojgaar uplabdh karaane ko lekar jo vaada kiya tha wo khaali jumala hi sabit hua
 During the discussion on the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi showed aggressive attitude against the Modi government on employment opportunities in the country
 rahul ne kaha, “do karod yuvaaon ko jo rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha, wo rojgaar kahaan hai? beete ek saal main sirf chaar lakh rojgaar die gaye
 China employs 50,000 youth every 24 hours
 aap 24 ghante main sirf 400 ko rojgaar dete ho
 The India Today Fact Check team investigated the allegations made by the Congress President in Parliament
 china sarkaar kii aadhikarik website ke mutabik china main 2016 ke mukaable 2017 main rojgaar srijan kii sthiti behatar hui
 China's unemployment rate3
 9% he jabaki bharat main berogari dar 7
 1%
 china ke maanav sansaadhan or saamaajik suraksha (MHRS) mantralay ne is saal ke shuru main elaan kiya tha ki 2017 main vahaan 1 karod 35 lakh rojgaar paidaa kiye gaye jo 2016 kii tulana main 3,70,000 zyada he
 If we take the figure of total employment generation in China every day, then it sits at 37,013
 jabaki rahul ne sansad main kaha ki china main har ghante 50,000 rojgaar kaa srijan hota he
 It is clear that Rahul showed the figure of China slightly increased in Parliament
 ab aate hai is baat par ki kya modi ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle vaada kiya tha ki agar unki party satta main ai to har saal do karod rojgaar paidaa kiye jaaenge? rahul ne aise hi vaade kaa hawala dete hue shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main daawa kiya
 At an election rally in Agra on 21 November 2013, Modi promised one crore jobs as the Prime Ministerial face of the NDA
 modi ne kaha tha, “agar bijepi satta main ai to ye ek karod job muhaiyaa karaayegi jo ki upie sarkaar pichley loksabhaa chunaav main vaada karne ke baavjood uplabdh nahin kara pai
 "congress has been mentioning that Modi's promise to give two crore jobs has not been fulfilled for a long time
 india today fact chack team ko modi ke aise kisi bhaashan kaa pataa nahin laga jisamen unhone do karod rojgaar srijan kaa vaada kiya ho
 Nor was such a promise included in the bjp's manifesto for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 agar vaade ke mutabik ek karod job paanch saal main srujit kiye jane the to har din ke hisaab se ye aankada 5479 job kaa baithta he
 Did the Modi government achieve this goal? to iskaa sidhaa jawaab nahin he
 After completing a four-year term, the Modi government is lagging behind this figure by a huge margin
 shram or rojgaar mantralay kii 2016-17 kii report ke mutabik aath sangathit sectoron main, jo ki desh ke kul jobs main 81 fisadi kii numaaindgi karte hai, pichley saal sirf 4
 1
6 million jobs were added
 ye har din ke hisaab se sirf 1139 job hi baithta he
 Obviously, the government is not even close to half of the job creation target
 fact chack team kii padtaal se saamne aayaa ki rahul ne china main rojgaar srijan ko lekar vaastaviktaa se kuch badha chadha kar kaha
 Also misquoted the Prime Minister about his promise on job creation
 haalanki rahul ne ye sahi ingit kiya ki modi sarkaar ne rojgaar srijan ke liye apni ore se jo lakshya rakhaa tha, usase kahin peeche he

 rajya ke police mahanideshak wike singh kii ore se jari kii gai is adwijuri main rajya police bal ko nirdesh diya he ki ve police abhiraksha main anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke vyaktiyon ke saath abhadra vyavhaar yaa marpet na karen
 With this, instructions have been issued not to take custody if not very necessary
 dijipi ne sabhi atirikt mahanideshkon (ediji), diaiji or sabhi police adhikshakon ko nirdesh 4 november ko jari kiye gaye the
 It has been written in this directive that some incidents have come to light recently, in which a case of indecent behavior and assault of persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes during police custody has come to light
 in ghatnaon ko lekar rashtriya anusuchit janajati ayog dwaara gambhir aapatti vyakt kii gai he
 In such a situation, the arrest of any person should be made in full compliance with the relevant provisions of the law and procedure
 saath hi police hiraasat main kisi bhi aousuchit jati or janajati varg ke vyakti ke saath abhadra vyavhaar or marpet na kii jaae
 The circular also directs that SC / ST persons be detained only when it is important under the existing legal provisions
 rashtriya anusuchit janajati ayog ne haal hi main rajya ke adivasee bahul alirajpur jile ke nanpur police stesan se sambandhit agast 2019 ke maamle ko uthaaya tha, jahaan paanch adivasee yuvakon kii kathith rup se pitayee kii gai thi or police hiraasat main peshaab pine ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha
 When contacted in the matter, state Home Minister Bala Bachchan said that instructions have been issued to follow the guidelines issued by the National Commission
 vahiin is maamle main purv mantri or bijepi vidhayak vishwaas saarang ne sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha he ki dijipi kaa ye khat sabit kar rahaa he ki pradesh kii kanoon vyavastha kharaab he
 The Chief Minister should explain in this matter
 dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne aakhirkaar kerala ke rajyapal pad se istipha de diya
 He was aware that he would be transferred to Mizoram first and then sacked
 iske pehle maharashtra ke rajyapal ke shankaranarayanan ne bhi istifadia tha or dukh jataayaa tha ki unka tabadalaa kiya ja rahaa he
 But Sheila Dixit came quietly to Delhi and submitted her resignation
 unhone is baar kisi tarah kaa vivaad nahin kiya or bijepi sarkaar kii baat maan lee
 Sheila Dixit is a shrewd player of politics and knows very well what steps should be taken and which are not
 jab dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar thi to unhenanan-fanan main kerala kaa rajyapal bana diya gaya tha
 This has two advantages
 pehla to yah ki vah dilli ke shor sharabe se dur chali gayi or doosraa yah ki unhen legal immunity mil gai
 That is, as the governor, he could not be sued
 yah unke liye jaruri tha kyonki vipaksh unke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke jabardast aarope laga rahaa tha or aam aadmi party ke chif arvind kejariwal ne unhen jail membhejane kaa janata se vaada kiya tha
 Sheela Dixit moved from Delhi to Kerala by taking the right decision at the right time
 or ab vah thik usee tarah se istipha de ain
 Obviously, they must have thought of something for themselves
 vah sonia gandhi ke kareebi logon main rahi hai or congress main unka virodh karne vaale bhi unhen mukhyamantri pad se hatwa nahin paae the, jabaki unka report card behad niraashajanak tha
 At that time only the people of his party were opposing him and asking the high command to relieve him
 lekin shila dikshit kii janpath main pakad bahut majboot thi
 Knowing that the party would go badly in the assembly elections, the party gave him a chance
 uske baad unhen kanoonee jhamelon se bachaane ke liye rajyapal bana diya gaya
 But now he resigned, fearing to go to Mizoram
 lekin yah tay he ki shila dikshit ne yah pehle se soch rakhaa hoga ki aage unhen kis tarah kii raajnneeti kerani he yaa koun sa pad sanbhaalanaa he
 Anyway, the Congress party in Delhi has not been able to show any kind of shine
 party main na to koi utsaah dikhataa he or na hi koi ranneeti
 Sometimes leaders come on the streets of Delhi to make their presence known or make some kind of statement
 lekin unke paas koi aisa netaa nahin he jo party ko majbootee pradaan kar sake
 Obviously his role is going to be important
 jo log unhen jaanate hai, ve yah bhi jaanate hai ki shila dikshit chup baithne vaali nahin hai
 The party needs them and they can register their presence easily
 duniya kii badi tech companiyaan aipal or fasebuk ne khule taur par america president ellection main democratic candidet hillari clinton ko saport kiya tha
 Top executives of these companies called Clinton a better candidate and also made more donations

 unhone kaha he,' desh kii samasyaon ko sulajhane ke liye bade tareekon kii jarurat he
 'now whether Apple's policy will change, Trump has given it boycott, Donald Trump asked people to boycott Apple
 isaki vajah yah thi ki san barnardino ke shooting ke baad us shooter kaa yphone analock karne se manaa kar diya tha
 Trump had said, "apple should oppose Apple's product until Apple unlocks the iphone and provides information"
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki wo aipal or samsung kaa smartphone yuj karte hai or agar aipal ne jaankaree nahin di to wo yphone yuj karnaa band kar denge
 In such a situation, will Apple be able to continue with that policy even after becoming President of Donald Trump? This is a big question and in the days to come it can begin to be discussed
 kya donald trump or tim cook main bahes hogi?aipal ke alaava donald trump ne logon se america shopping website Macy's ko bycott karne ko kaha tha
 And the reason behind this was that this company removed Trump's clothing from his store after making statements against the Mexican immigrant
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki trump america ke bade bijnesaman hai
 Will the internet be shut down? Donald Trump During a rally in South Carolina, Donald Trump said that the Internet would have to be shut down to fight terrorist organizations like the Islamic State
 unke mutabik wo internet ko band karaane ke liye bill gates or duusare logon ke paas jaaenge
 So now after he becomes president, internet will be shut down in some places? Will it affect Facebook too? Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft founder Bill Gates have also told many things that clearly shows that Donald Trump will prove to be no better for them
 jakarberg ne safataur se donald trump kii imigration policy ko galat bataaya he, kyonki wo duniya ko ek community maanate hai
 So will Facebook also be affected after Trump becomes president? It would not be surprising if we get such news in the coming days! 'donald Trump became president of American and changed Apple's policy', or 'donald Trump became president After the internet stopped in many cities of America

 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko ek aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue saalon se chal rahi teen talaak kii pratha ko khatm kar diya
 a 5-judge bench gave the verdict of 3-2
 faisla aane ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne iskaa swaagat kiya or kaha ki is faisle se muslim mahilaon ko sammaan kaa haq milegaa
 It is clear that the BJP would like to capitalize on this decision in the coming times and fulfill the promise of the Uniform Civil Code made in the manifesto
 2014 caloksabhaa chunaavamein jari menifesto main bijepi ne iskaa vaada kiya tha
 On page 41 of the manifesto it is stated that Article 44 of the constitution is a part of the policy to give equal citizens rights to citizens
 haalanki, teen talaak par supreme court kaa jo faisla he usase uniform civil code lagu hone main koi aasaani nahin milegi
 But BJP can take further steps on this issue
 aapako bataa den ki teen talaak ke alaava abhi supreme court main nikaah halaala or bahuvivaah pratha par bhi sunwaayee chal rahi he
 Are the steps towards a truly growing Uniform Civil Code? Uniform Civil Code, if applied in the country, will have uniform rules for all religions
 mahila or purushon ke bich niyam-kanoon ko lekar bhi isse aage kii ore kadam badhenge
 It is clear that Muslim personal law is also on the backfoot with the Supreme Court's decision on 3 divorces
 faisle ke baad kya bole piem or shahmangalvaar ko court ke faisle ke baad piem modi ne twit kiya ki supreme court ke dwaara teen talaak par diya gaya faisla aitihaasik he
 This decision will give equal rights to Muslim women, this is a big step towards women empowerment
 vahiin amit shah ne bhi court ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 Shah issued a statement saying that the court's decision marks the beginning of a new era for Muslim women
 shah ne kaha ki yah faisla new india kii ore badhata hua ek kadam he

 BJP will benefit from them " lakhanu ke gomtinagar ilaake ke vibhutikhand main parshavnath planet ke naam se logon ko ashiana dene kaa ek project shuru hua
 This project started in 2006, but now even after 10 years, the project of 16-storey building has not been completed till 2016
 nateeja ye he ki logon ne bilders ke khilaaf poster bhi lagaae lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 Whereas the project started after 1 year in its possession has become complete
 lekin yahaan ke log bhi apana ashiana paane ke liye taras rahe hai
 Aaj Tak tried to find out from the people through 'operation Grihapravesh' how the builders cheated him
 graahakon kii tuutati ummidengraahak hemlata kaa kahana he ki unhone 2006 main apanoflett book karaayaa thajo ki 2010 main dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha
 She has been living on rent for the last 8-10 years
 apana ghar paane kaa unka sapana jaise kahin kho gaya he
 Neelam Bhargava said that her husband retired in 2012
 unhone apni sari jamaa puunji in builder ko de di
 It has been 10 years but he is still living on rent
 building main jo flats hai wo alot to ho gaye hai lekin rahane laayak nahin hai
 Builders say that you should invest the money you want to invest in it
 ab nae rate par paise maang rahen hai buildergrahakon kaa kahana he ki 2006 main book kiye gaye flats jo abhi tak puure nahin hue hai
 For that the builder is asking for money at the new rate
 10 saal pehle project deal kaa nuksaan ye hua ki project jab shuru hua tha to 1500-1600 rupee squaire feet par shuru hua tha
 But today the rate in this area has reached 3200 to 3500 rupees
 builderko lag rahaa he ki usko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 In a hurry, the builder has started work after the people of Parshvanath Planet, which are being built in Vibhuti section of Gomti Nagar, Kamalkhanu
 lekin jaldbaaji main jo kaam kiya ja rahaa hausamen bhi takneekee khamiyaan dikhaai de rahi hai
 Sewer lines are being built from outside
 jo beam main chhed karke banaai ja rahi he
 This can cause cracks in case of earthquake or any such event
 bhartiya janata party ne shuukravaar ko karnataka ke liye apana ghoshnaptr jari kar diya he
 bjp's chief ministerial candidate in the state b
 es
 Yeddyurappa made several big announcements while releasing the manifesto
 khaas baat ye he ki bijepi ke is menifesto ke centre main mahilaayein rahi hai
 In its manifesto, the party has announced many such schemes for women, which can benefit them in elections
 # mahilaon ko do lakh rupye tak kaa 1 pratishat byaaj dar par karj # bipiel parivaar kii sabhi mahilaon ko free smartphone # 1-2 lakh rupye middle class or loar class kii mahilaon ko die jaaenge
 (bhagyalakshmi Scheme) # 3 Gram Mangalasutra for women of all BPL families on the occasion of their marriage
 # mahilaon or bacchon kii suraksha ke liye puure rajya main sisitivi camere lagaae jaaenge
 # BPL Free sanitary napkin for women and girls, other women for just 1 rupee
 aapako bataa den ki shuukravaar ko hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne karnataka bijepi mahila morcha kii kaaryakartaaon se baat kii
 The PM in his dialogue told the workers that the schemes being run by the central government, women are at the center
 isiilie vot maangate samay in baton kaa prachaar jarur karen
 How many women voters in the state? Tell you that according to the Election Commission a total of 4 in Karnataka
 96 karod voter hai
 2 of these
 44 karod mahilaayein hai
 Accordingly, about 49 percent of the population is women
 saaf he ki bijepi kaa target inhen votaron par he
 Let us tell you that in this election, Congress has given ticket to 16, BJP 6 and JDS 4 women candidates in total
 gauratlab he ki karnataka main 12 may ko matdaan hona he
 The results will be declared on May 15 in the state
 haal hi main aae kai opanian pole main trishanku vidhansabha hone kii ashanka dikhaai di
 In the open poll, Deve Gowda's party appears in the role of JDS King Maker
 india today ke pole main congress ko 90 se 101 seat or bijepi ko 78 se 86 seat milane kii sambhaavna he
 On the other hand, JDS is likely to get 34-43 seats
 karnataka kii kumaraswami sarkaar kii satta se vidaai ke baad bijepi kii najar madhya pradesh kii kamalnath sarkaar par he
 In such a situation, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was constantly threatening to topple the Congress of Madhya Pradesh in a minority
 lekin kamalnath ne hi bijepi par hi 'sargical strike' kar di
 Kamal Nath has joined the Congress by breaking two BJP mlas
 is tarah se congress ne bijepi se 2013 kaa hisaab baraabar kar liya he
 In Madhya Pradesh, two BJP mlas have switched sides with Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 bijepi ke vidhayak narayan treepathi or vidhayak sharad kol ne buudhvaar ko voting ke dauraan apni party se baghawat kar congress ke paksh main vot karke apni manshaa jaahir kar di
 The dramatic manner in which Kamal Nath has shocked the BJP, caused a stir in the political corridors from Bhopal to Delhi
 2013 main bhaajapa ne diya tha congress ko jhatkamadhya pradesh kii vidhansabha sadan ke bheetar jis tarah se bijepi ke do vidhayak tuutakar kamalnath kheme ke saath aakar khadey ho gaye hai, usne 2013 kii yaad ko taaja kar diya he
 The difference is that in 2013, the BJP gave the Congress a 'slow thrust'
 jabaki is baar congress ne bijepi ko usase bhi tagada jhatka de diya he
 In 2013, the Congress was in opposition in the state and brought a no-confidence motion in the Assembly against the Shivraj government
 avishvaas prastaav par charchaa aarambh hone ke thik pehle congress vidhayak dal ke upanetaa choudhary rakesh singh ne apane hi dal ko kathghare main khadaa karte hue prastaav kii hawa nikaal di thi
 Not only this, Rakesh Singh left the Congress and joined the BJP
 haalanki maujuuda samay main rakesh singh congress main 'ghar vaapasi' kar chuke hai
 After 6 years, Kamal Nath took such revenge, Congress has avenged this pain given by the BJP after 6 years
 madhya pradesh vidhansabha main dand samhita sanshodhan vidheyak par mat vibhaajan ke dauraan bijepi ke do vidhayakon narayan treepathi or sharad kol ne apana samarthan mukhyamantri kamalnath ke netritv vaali congress sarkaar ko de diya
 Along with Kamal Nath, Congress MLA Arif Masood of Bhopal Central has been instrumental in the two BJP mlas voting in favor of the Congress
 baghawat karne vaale vidhayakon kii ghar vaapasibijepi se baghawat karne vaale donon vidhayak pehle congressi netaa rahe hai
 Narayan Tripathi also defected after the last assembly election
 ve maihar se vidhayak hai
 The last time he joined BJP after winning on a Congress ticket
 is baar bijepi se chunaav jeet kar congress main chale gaye
 The other Sharad Kaul is an MLA from Beauhari
 ek samay main donon congress kaa haath chhodkar bijepi ke saath ho gaye the
 On Wednesday, both of them said the same thing after the vote, 'BJP was suffocating
 kshetra ke vikaas kii vajah se bijepi main gaye the, dhokhaa mila or vikaas nahin hua
 Little promises and false declarations were made in the BJP government
 ab ghar laut aae hai
 Cole even told Kamal Nath his own icon
 mukhyamantri floor cross karne vaale donon vidhayakon ko saath lekar apane kaksh main chale gaye
 In the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, Vijay Kumar Malhotra has been declared the candidate for the post of Chief Minister in the upcoming elections
 vaise dilli main raajnneetik taur par harshavardhan or vijay goyal kaaphi sakriy maane jate hai
 However, the Congress has been beating the BJP in the last two consecutive elections
 lekin is baar bhaajapa ke paas ceiling or aparaadh jaise pramukh muddon ko bhunaane kaa mauka he

 The memory of 9 / 11, the biggest attack on America after 9 / 11, still haunts America
 america ke saath-saath puri duniya ne tab aatank kaa sabase khaufnak cheharaa dekha tha, wo bhi bilkul live
 This was the largest terrorist attack on America in the history of America
 is hamale ke baad america ne elaan kiya tha ki wo apane desh kii suraksha vyavastha itani majboot kar degaa ki phir dobaaraa kabhi kisi kii aise hamale kii himmat nahin hogi

 There was a huge crowd in the club due to the holiday
 Due to the holiday of the night, the night club was overcrowded
 club abhi bhi puri tarah se gulzaar tha
 About three and a half hundred people were still inside the club
 tabhi achaanak asolt raifal or shotgan liye ek shaks club main daakhil hota he or andhadhundh firing shuru kar detaa he
 There was a loud noise of music in the Lashenjis Club just minutes before, now there was a scream around everywhere
 logon ko kuch samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ye achaanak kya hua he
 There was only one way to escape and that madcap was firing indiscriminately on the same path
 dekhte hi dekhte club main laashon kii ginati badhane lagi
 Those who remained inside were hidden as hostages within the voklub
 police ne nite club ko gheraa lekin
 
 
 By now the sound of the firing had shocked even those around the club
 unheen ke jariye khabar police tak pahunchi
 The Orlando police had surrounded the nightclub in a short time, but the truth inside the club was not known to the police
 jaldbaazi main uthaaya gaya koi bhi kadam na sirf unke liye balki club main bandhak banaae gaye saikadon logon ke liye jaanaleva sabit ho saktaa tha
 So, upon reaching the threshold of the club, the police steps were also stalled and likewise, three hours passed between fear, panic and pain
 ection main ai police timudhar, club ke andar se rah-rah kar goliyon or cheekh-pukaar kii aawaaj ab bhi aa rahi thi
 Meanwhile, the police get correct information inside from some hostages and eyewitnesses trapped inside the club
 police ko pataa chalata he ki hamalavar sirf ek he
 Then the police team comes into action
 bearcat naam kii ek bakhtarband gaadi main pehle to commando club ke andar daakhil hote hai or phir aakhirkaar us shaks ko maar giraate hai
 The death of 50 people was probably too late in the operation, because before he died he alone had killed fifty people, while the same number were inside the club, wounded by bullets
 hamalavar ne 39 logon kii jaan to club ke andar hi le lee thi jabaki do log club ke baahar or nau ne aspataal jane ke baad dam tod diya
 ISIS took responsibility after this orgy of death lasting three hours, when Orlando's criminal's face was exposed, once again the name of ISIS, the world's bloodiest terrorist organization, was exposed
 america ko dahalaanevaale is aatankwaadi hamale ke peeche iesas se jude ek aise aatankwaadi kaa haath tha, jise samalangikon se nafrat thi
 However, the father of this person of Afghan origin says that ISIS or religion has nothing to do with the massacre in the club
 samalangikon se karata tha nafaratatin ghante ke koharaam ke baad jab pulse nite club kaa hamalavar police kii goliyon se dher hua to uski pahchaan pataa karne main zyada der nahin lagi
 This was the same person who had burst out of anger after seeing two boys kiss each other on the world famous Miami Beach a few months from now
 jaahir he, wo samalangikon se nafrat karata tha lekin uski nafrat america ke sabase bade ge nite klbon main se ek pulse par yun kahar ban kar tuutegi, ye khud uske gharavaalon ne bhi kabhi khwaabon main nahin sochaa tha
 The fanatic was Omar Matinasutra, after this attack, not only did ISIS take responsibility for the Orlando attack through two different Twitter accounts, but it was also named as the ISIS hero with the picture of Omar S
 Matin, but this is not so 
 sutron kii maane to khud hamalavar ne bhi apane maare jane se pehle kathith taur par police ko 911 par phone kar apane aisaies se jude hone kii baat kahi thi or jab uski maut ke baad police ne uski detail khangaali to ye saaf ho gaya ki wo koi or nahin balki florida kaa rahanevaala afgani mul kaa ek aisa america naagarik he, jo kabhi shahar ke hi ek bal sudhaar grih yani juvenil home main security guard kaa kaam kiya karata tha or jiske dimag main kattarpan kaa jehar pehle se maujuud tha
 The police had also kept an eye on Omar in the past, it became clear that Omar S
 Matin had been on the radar of the police earlier due to terrorist activities and even the FBI himself had questioned him two to three times
 haalanki tab uske khilaaf koi pukhta saboot nahin hone kii vajah se use chhod diya gaya
 Now, police are looking for evidence of his direct involvement with ISIS
 hamalavar ke pita ne bataaya sanakeedusri ore matin ke pita mir siddiqui ne is vaardaat ke liye logon se maafee maangate hue apane bete ko sanakee qaraar diya he
 Siddiqui has revealed that in Miami a few months ago, Matin was horribly dazed when he saw two boys kissing each other
 or tabhi unhen pataa chalaa ki matin samalangikon se itnaa zyada nafrat karata he
 However, the words of Matin's father Siddiqui after this attack are not too surprising
 usne kaha ki uske bete ko aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha ki kyonki allaah khud hi samalangik logon ko kadi sazaa dene vaale hai
 Siddiqui also said that his son was a good son and if he had known that Matin would do so, he would have tried to stop him
 dimagi taur par biimaar tha matinudhar, matin kii purv patni sitora usufi ne bhi uske bare main kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai
 Sitora has told the police that Matin would not only assault her after marriage, but also get so violent at times that it would have been difficult to stop her
 haalanki usufi ne is hamale ko kisi majahab se na jodne kii apil karte hue kaha ki ye ek shaks kii dimagi beemaari kaa maamla he or ise usee rup main liya janaa chahie
 ISIS poses threat to world's most powerful country; ISIS may have knocked for the first time in America, but Baghdadi has made Europe cry many times

 Election 2019: After Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has given a big statement regarding exit poll
 unhone kaha ki 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kaa parinaam agsit pole ke anuroop hi hoga
 Arun Jaitley said that the Narendra Modi (PM Modi-led NDA) will come to power once the election results are in line with the exit poll
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye ravivaar shaam ko jari zyaadaatar eczit pole ke mutabik ek baar phir bhaajapa nit rajg bahumat se kendra main sarkaar banaata dikh rahaa he

 arun jetali (arun Jaitley) ne apane blog ‘eczit pole kaa sandesh' main kaha ki ham main se kai eczit pole kii satyata or uske sateek hone ko lekar takaraar kar sakate hai
 He further said that but the reality is that different exit polls have the same message and the results will be roughly the same message
 unhone kaha ki eczit pole main iviem kaa koi yogadan nahin hota he or aise main agar aam chunaav kaa vaastavik parinaam bhi agar eczit pole ke anuroop rahata he tab vipaksh dwaara uthaaye gaye farji iviem mudde kaa bhi astitv nahin rah jaayegaa
 The senior BJP leader said that if the exit polls were like 2014 results then it would become clear that Indian democracy has matured a lot
 matadaata apni pasand chunane se pehle rashtriya hiton ko sarvopari maanate hai
 This creates a wave when people with good ideas vote in the same direction with similar views
 congress kaa ullekh karte hue arun jetali ne kaha ki gandhi parivaar grand old party ke liye boj ban gaya he
 In the Congress, the first family is no longer a capital but a burden
 unhone kaha ki matadaata ab pratidwandviyon ke gathbandhan par bharosa karne ko taiyaar nahin hai

 aisa sirf isi film main hui Film - saw a girl, it felt like - Sonam Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Rajkumar Rao, Regina Kasandra Others Directors - Shaily Chopra Dharrating - 1
 5'ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga' relies ho gai he
 With this, another director made her Bollywood debut as Shaily Chopra Dhar
 iskaa nirmaan fox star ke saath vidhu vinod chopra ne kiya he
 Two questions arise in the mind after watching the film, which is about 2 hours long
 pehla ise banaaya kyon gaya? or doosraa yah ki rajkumaar raav ne aakhir kyon ye film kii?film main do kahaniyaan hai
 One is Sweetie (sonam Kapoor Ahuja) and the other is Sahil Mirza (rajkumar Rao)
 vaise ahm sweety kii kahani he, jiske saath sahil mirza kii kahani judakar chalati rahati he
 Sweety is a girl from Moga (a small town in Punjab)
 uske pita balvir choudhary (anil kapur) garment kaarobaari hai
 Has a brother and several servants in the house are Chakar (brijendra Kala, Seema Pahwa)
 sweety sabhi kii ladli he
 As Sweetie is graduated, the family is concerned about her marriage
 sweety hair ajukeshan ke bahaane landan janaa chaahati he
 But Sweety's brother Babloo wants to stop him from going
 udhar, drama riter or diarector sahil mirza ek bade film produsar kaa betaa he
 Sahil has a passion for theater
 uske pita chaahate hai ki wo theatre or riting jaise phaltu kaam kii bajaae film industry jwoin kar le
 Accidentally Sahil and Sweety meet in Delhi
 sweety ke munh se tru vaale lav kii kahani sunne or paristhitiyon ko sach maanakar sahil, sweety ko dil de baithta he
 He reaches Moga on the pretext of innovating in the theater
 sweety ke ghar main sahil se uske relationships kii charchaa hoti he
 Householders don't care about Sahil's religion
 tamaam utaar chadhaav ke baad balvir choudhary, sahil se sweety kii shaadi karaane ko raji ho jate hai
 All the big characters of the story come out in the first half itself
 inamen shaukia drama actor chhataro yani juhi chawla bhi hai, jinhen balvir choudhary kii umradraj lav interest ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 The twist in the story comes when Sahil learns of Sweety's reality
 asaliyat yah ki wo lesbian he
 Apart from his brother, his father, grandmother and all the relatives are unknown
 sweety kaa "tru lav" koi or nahin ek ladki he
 I
e
 Kuhu (regina Kasandra)
 sachai jaanane ke baad sahil tay karata he ki wo sweety ke liye kuch karegaa
 What Sahil did, how the family came to know Sweety's reality, what Bablu does and how Balveer would take things would go to see the film

 # setlovefree # ekladkikodekhatohaisalaga @vinodchoprafilms @foxstarhindia post shared bysonamkahuja (@sonamkapoor) onjan 31, 2019 at 11:54 pm PST Last year, the Supreme Court quashed section 377
 is faisle ke baad samalangik sambandhon ko kanoonee manyata mil gai
 When i saw a girl, it felt like this decision was made
 faisle ke baad ye pehali film he jisamen samalangik relationships main rahane vaale logon kii apni pareshaaniyon ko movie main dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 But the biggest mistake from Shaily Chopra was that she could not establish the most important point of the story properly
 kahani main sandesh bhi he or manoranjan bhi lekin vah bikharaa bikharaa he
 That is entertainment but in different parts
 suspence banane ke chakkar main acchhee bhalee kahani kaa kabada ho gaya
 It happened that after the interval in the twist of the twist, it is known what the story really is, and after this the story became a victim of excessive speed
 jo pehle half kii vajah se hona hi tha
 In Kuhu and Sweety's chemistry, gay people facing hatred of society and family do not see emotion
 ek ghante se zyada vakt tak jo ladki apane bare main pita se khulkar baat nahin kar paati, wo agle 25 se 30 minute main pita, parivaar or samaaj ke khilaaf tanakar khadi ho jaati he
 In a way, when i saw a girl, it felt like just touching the topic of lesbian and giving a wedding and speech of a Hindu Muslim girl is just a story
 mul topic ko zyada jagah dena kahani kii demand thi
 The last 20 minutes are very emotional and very impressive
 sahil mirza ke rup main rajkumaar kaa kaam badhiya he
 But his character does not appear to be woven properly
 shuru main lagata he jaise sahil mirza kii alag hi kahani he, lekin baad main wo kho jaati he
 Based on Rajkumar's previous films and his selection, fans looking at his film may wonder why he did it? In the first half, Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Rajkumar Rao, Brijendra Kala, Madhumati Kapoor and Seema Pahwa's actresses and live-in comic scenes save it from being cumbersome
 film kii sabase acchhee baat bas yahi he
 Sonam Kapoor who is the main character does not impress that much
 chota hi sahi kuhu ke rup main rejina casandra ko dekhnaa dilachasp he
 Anil Kapoor and Brijendra Kala are experts in their own fun
 juhi chawla bhi thik thaak hai
 The camera is good
 parde par kuch kuch shots dekhnaa fresh lagata he
 Music is also right
 film ke gane log pasand hi kar rahe hai
 Shaily Chopra Dhar could have made her debut more memorable
 ho saktaa he darshak theatre kii bajaae ise tivi par dekhnaa zyada pasand karen
 Obviously, it is meaningless to expect more at the box office
