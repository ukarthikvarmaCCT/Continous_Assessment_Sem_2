 us gaadi kii bhi forensik jaanch kii ja rahi he, jisamen 16 kii shaam kareeb chaar baje shekhar ko apurva ne litayaa tha
 From the court to the Chief Election Commissioner, he has confirmed the impenetrable security of evms
 purv mukhya chunaav ayukta chaahe esavai kuraishi hon yaa dow manohar singh gil yaa phir naveen chawla yaa vies sampat
 They all believed in evms
 rahi baat adaalaton kii to supreme court ne bhi ek nahin teen-teen baar yachikakartaon kii daleelein or jirah suni, exparts kii raay lee or faisla diya ki iviem aparaajey he
 Former Chief Election Commissioner y y Qureshi has said that the matter of tampering of evms is nonsense
 jab johar dikhaane kii baari aati he to koi aage nahin aata
 While the security of evms and vvpats are also kept updated as per time
 1997 main pehali baar iviem se tamilnadu vidhansabha chunaav karaane vaale purv mukhyachunaav ayukta dow manohar singh gil ne dotuk kaha iviem tab bhi sabase zyada surakshit thi or ab bhi
 The questioners changed
 inhen iviem ne jab satta main baithaaya to iviem acchhee or sachhee
 evms are useless and false if lost
 gil ne kaha jab wo mukhya chunaav ayukta theto 1997 main pehali baar iviem se chunaav hue the
 Then to know about the quality and publicity of evms in Jaipur, the response on the seal versus machine, by putting a tent on the street nooks themselves, women would call and come and go to the next tent and vote in a new way
 phir unase anubhav jaanate
 In these 20 years, the quality and safety of evms strengthened further
 harek CEC or ayog ne isamen kuch naa kuch ijapha kiya
 Now the VVPAT feature was also added
 par chunaav main haarane vaali party or netaa is par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 While the most powerful brand of Make in India, these are evms
 ab to itani taadaad main hai ki kisi afasar ko pataa nahin hota ki koun si iviem kidar jaani he
 How would someone mess up in such situation? jabaki nirmaataa companyek baar programingkarne ke baad khud bhi chip main badlaav nahin kar sakati
 It is actually similar to burncd and DVD
 isamen ririte jaisaa koi vikalp he hi nahin
 In such a situation, the charge of disturbances is a fantasy
 purv mukhya chunaav ayukta gil ko jab pataa chalaa ki congress netaa or desh ke purv kanoonmantri em virappa moili ne iviem kaa samarthan kiya he to pehle unhen hairaani hui or phir beintahaa khushi
 Gill said that those who find flaws in evms should go to the court
 kachhari kaa aadesh hoga to shikayatakarta ko iviem kholane or khilne ko bhi muhaiyaa kara di jaaegi
 Try it vigorously
 kaamyaab hue to ayog iviem ko or zyada surakshit kar degaa
 Otherwise there is impenetrable security
 nainital hoicourt ke jaj rajeev sharma or sharad sharma ke khandpeeth ne apane 17 pej ke aadesh ke paanchaven panne main saaf likhaa he ki chunaav ayog kiiviem ko haikanhin kiya ja saktaa he
 After thorough study of the Commission's Aureesh release and other evidence, the court is convinced that evms are completely safe
 desh main hi inaki chip banati he or van time printbal he
 There are many such advanced systems with micro number systems that they become impermeable
 yahaan tak ki inhen kahin le jate vakt yaa kisi bhi tareeke se hack nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The last page of its 17-page order states that it is the duty and responsibility of the court to help the constitutional institutions to maintain dignity
 hamen abhivyakti kii aazaadee hone kaa matlab ye katai nahin he ki sanvaidhanik sansthaaon par bevajaah chhintakashi karen
 Play with their dignity

 ye sab hockey india ke nishane par rahe
 Now out of the team
 darasal hockey india ke adhyaksh naren batra ke saath ye sabhi chehre maujuuda hockey kii tasviir banate nazar aa rahe hai- vajah khel nahin vivaad hai
 This is when the Indian team has become the first team to qualify for the Rio Olympics and its world ranking has improved to number eight after the World Hockey League semi-final tournament
 rio olympic kii taiyaari ke liye saal bhar pehle maidan se zyaada halchal daphtaron main rahi
 Officers in Delhi offices continued to score the same side
 lekin vivaadon kii garmi shimla se qareeb 60 kilometre dur 8000 fit kii oonchai par hai oltitude training kar rahi team hockey india tak bhi pahunch hi gai
 At the Shilaru Hockey Camp, a whirlwind of controversies was left behind
 olympic se ek saal pehle hockey team ek baar phir se sanvarne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Every member of the team seems to be trying to make the atmosphere at least positive
 pahadiyon se ghire shilaru hockey camp main ek alag beficri he
 The focus is only on the ball, the player and the goalpost
 yahaan team kaa fitaness test kiya ja rahaa he
 Fitness is considered the mantra of team success in modern hockey
 is test main har beep ke saath khilaadiyon ko apni speed badhaani he
 At an altitude of 8000 feet, it is difficult to walk fast
 
 
 ye behad mushkil test he
 Only 5 players out of 33 remain on the 19 beep
 phir do or phir sirf gurbaj
 Been in the race to prove himself like Gurbaz
 shaayad wo ye bhi sabit karnaa chaahate hai ki unpar laga anushaasanheenata kaa tamgaa unke manobal ko nahin tod saktaa
 Gurbaz is the star midfielder of the team and the captain and coach understand his importance well
 sardaar kehete hai ki gurbaj team ke behad ahm khilaadi hai lekin wo maanate hai ki team sabase upar he
 Coach Altmans says that this issue is more about understanding and knowledge than indiscipline in the team
 shilaru main team kaa yo-yo test bhi kiya gaya
 One of the most senior players of the team, Gurbaj Singh topped it, one of the youngest players of the team, Aamir Khan was second
 senior or junior khilaadiyon ke bich kaa ye faaslaa shaayad team kii sabase badi taaqat he
 That is, 26-year-old Gurbaz and 22-year-old Aamir Khan are as fit as the top teams in the world, Australia, Holland or Germany
 lekin team ke australian fitaness trainer mathew iles (mat) abhi isse santusht nahin
 At Shilaru's high altitude training camp, he keeps on encouraging the players to get beyond their limits
 wo maanate hai ki team ke kai khilaadi behad fit hai
 They praise the fitness of players like Dharmaveer, Kothajit, Chinglensana, Gurbaj
 lekin unka kahana he ki isamen or bhi sudhaar kii ganjaish he
 Matt knows that in order to keep the enthusiasm of the players, he will also have to compete with them
 isliye practice ke baad coach tushaar khandekar ke saath res main khud ko aazamaa rahe hai
 But in the race, the game gets beaten
 vaise bhi tushaar ne haal hi main khilaadi se coach banane kaa safar tay kiya he isliye unki fitaness kaa level thodaa behatar he
 Speed determines the ability of a hockey team
 aise kai vaakye hai jab bhartiya team aakiri lamhon main match ganvaati nazar ai he
 Today is the test of the speed of the players
 speed get naam ke yantra ke sahare yahaan khilaadiyon kaa speed test ho rahaa he
 The players are in form and in a race to beat each other
 team ke shandaar forward esavi sunil, srijesh or lalit jaise khilaadiyon se baazi markar awwal number par rahete hai
 During the match, Sunil has been creating fear in opposition teams many times with the help of his speed
 hockey team or vivaad ek duusare ke peeche saaye kii tarah lage rahe hai
 This has not affected the health of the team, it can only be considered as an officially released statement
 team kii shaareerik or maansik sehat ko thik karne kii zimmedaari team ke saport staff par pehle se zyaada bad gai he
 Dutch coach Rolant Altmans is considered a highly skilled coach
 unhen holland team ko olympix, world cap or champions trophy main kamyaabi hasil karwaane kaa gaurav hasil he
 He has been associated with the Indian team as a high performance director for the last three years
 lekin team hockey india ke coach kii zimmedaari un par achaanak aan padi he1 acchhee baat ye he ki coach or khilaadiyon ne is badlaav ko sakaaratmak taur par liya he
 The coach says that he has an idea of the team and the team knows about him
 isliye ye nahin kaha ja saktaa ki wo zero se shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 Coach Altmans knows the fun of success
 wo team or khilaadi kii har baarik baat kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 When they are in the role of a general on the field, they take full care of the players from the food to the outside of the field
 khilaadi samajhane lage hai ki coach camp main unase kyon or kya ummiden rakhte hai
 Team Hockey India achieved many such successes in the last one year which raised great hope in Hockey Fans
 inchiyan asiad ke final main pakistan ko haraana yaa phir bhubaneshwar main hui champions trophy main holland jaisi team ko shikast dene se team ke hausalon ko pankh lag gaye
 With this encouragement, this team defeated a team like Australia in Azlan Shah Cup
 belgium main hui world hockey lig semifinal main qareeb aadhe darjan khilaadiyon ke puri tarah se fit nahin hone ke baavjood ye team australia, belgium or britain ke baad chauthe number par rahi
 But hockey officials did not take long to convert this success into a carat
 ye or baat he ki khilaadi or coach utani hi tezi se is nuksaan se ubarne kii baat karne lage
 35 years have passed since the last Olympic medal was won in 1980
 tab se lekar abtak olympic medal ko lekar intazaar badhata ja rahaa he
 Shahrukh's Chak De is as much a hit on screen as it is a challenge for the Indian team to truly say Chak De
 olympix dar olympix ye tis badhati hi jaati he
 The current team raises an expectation
 jaankaar team kii khoobiyon kii taareef karte hai to kamiyon kii ore ishaara bhi miltaa rahaa he
 Coach Altmans has also raised concerns about Team Hockey India's penalty corner
 bhartiya draig flikars umdaa to maane jate hai, lekin duniya ke duusare deshon kii tulana main unamem kitna dam he ye jaananaa zaruri he
 Ashley Jackson of England, Chris Ciriello of Australia and Philip Zeller of Germany are considered the world's leading drag filmmakers
 jis team ke draig flikars jitne damdaar
 
 
 That team was equally successful! India has scored 120 goals and scored 176 goals in 67 matches against the top ten teams from London Olympics so far! Of these 120 goals, 34 goals came through penalty corners
 bharat ne champions trophy or world hockey lig toornament ke dauraan 24 penlti corner ke mauqe banaaye jinamein is team ne sirf 9 gol kiye
 While 41 penalty corners were scored in these tournament against India in which 14 goals were scored
 penlti corner bananaa or use gol main tabdeel karnaa haal ke toornament main team india kii kamazor kadi sabit hui he
 By removing this one deficiency, the Indian team can win a big title
 jaankaar kehete hai ki bhartiya team kii short corner specialist kii bydaree main dam to he lekin coach oltmens raghunatha or bob yani rupinder ke alaava bhi duusare specialist kii talash main hai
 Players like Gurjinder and Jasjeet are emerging as good options
 rupinder or viaar raghunatha maanate hai ki unki abhyaas kii disha sahi he or wo khud se or team se badi ummid rakh rahe hai
 Separate setpieces, separate combinations are being looked for so that it can be exploited in big matches
 forward khilaadiyon ko penlti corner banane kii takanic ke gur bataaye ja rahe hai
 The comments samudr tal se 8000 fit kii oonchai par shilaru main hai oltitude training kaa kaa faaydaa team ko zarur mil saktaa he
 But before the Olympics reach the height of the podium, the team's challenges have increased immensely, the answer will be to find the entire hockey system
 itnaa zarur kaha ja saktaa he ki maidan ke baahar halaat chaahe jaise bhi hon
 
 
 The enthusiasm of the team on the field is increasing
 josh kii kami nahin
 Focus is on the pitch and eyes on the podium
 ye alam tab he jab bhartiya team rio olympix ke liye qualifaai karne vaali pehali team bani he or world hockey lig semifinal toornament ke baad isaki world ranking behatar hokar aathven number par pahunch gai he
 More than a year ago, much of the movement was in the offices to prepare for the Rio Olympics
 dilli ke daphtaron main adhikari saim said gol karte rahe
 But the heat of the disputes also reached Hockey India, a team doing high altitude training at an altitude of 8000 feet about 60 km from Shimla
 shilaru hockey camp main vivaadon kaa bavandar peeche chhutata nazar aayaa
 a year before the Olympics, the hockey team is preparing to rebuild once again
 kam se kam maahaul sakaaratmak ho isaki koshish team kaa har sadsy zarur karata nazar aata he
 Shilaru Hockey Camp surrounded by hills has a separate Befikri
 fokas sirf gend, khilaadi or goalpost par he
 The fitness test of the team is being done here
 modern hockey main fitaness ko team kii kamyaabi kaa mantra mana jaataa he
 In this test, players have to increase their speed with every beep
 8000 fit kii oonchai par jahaan tej chalanaa bhi mushkil ho
 
 
 This is a very difficult test
 19 kii beep par 33 main se sirf 5 khilaadi rah jate hai
 Then two and then only Gurbaz
 gurbaj jaise khud ko sabit karne kii res main rahe
 Perhaps they also want to prove that the tag of indiscipline imposed on them cannot break their morale
 gurbaj team ke star midfilder hai or captain or coach unki ahmiyat ko acchhee tarah samajhate hai
 Sardar says that Gurbaz is a very important player in the team but he believes that the team is at the top
 coach oltmens kehete hai ki team main anushaasanheenata se zyaada ye masalaa samajhadaari or jaankaree kaa he
 The team's yo-yo test was also done at Shilaru
 team ke sabase senior khilaadiyon main se ek gurbaj singh isamen awwal rahe to team ke sabase yuva khilaadiyon main se ek aamir khan duusare number par rahe
 This gap between senior and junior players is probably the biggest strength of the team
 yani 26 saal ke gurbaj or 22 saal ke aamir khan utane hi fit hai jitna ki duniya kii top team australia, holland yaa germany ke khilaadi hai
 But the team's Australian fitness trainer Matthew Isles (matt) is not satisfied yet
 shilaru ke hai oltitude training camp main wo khilaadiyon ko unki had se aage nikalne ke liye josh bharte rahete hai
 He believes that many of the team's players are very fit
 wo dharmaveer, kothajit, chingalensana, gurbaj jaise khilaadiyon ke naam lekar inaki fitaness kii taareef karte hai
 But he says that there is scope for further improvement
 mat jaanate hai ki khilaadiyon kaa utsaah banaaye rakhane ke liye unhen khud bhi unase compit karnaa hoga
 Therefore, after practice, the coach is trying himself in the race with Tusshar Khandekar
 lekin res main tushaar baazi maar jate hai
 Anyway, Tushar has recently decided to go from player to coach, so his fitness level is slightly better
 speed, hockey team kii kaabiliyat tay karti he
 There have been many instances when the Indian team has been seen losing matches in the last moments
 aaj khilaadiyon kii raftaar kaa imtihaan he
 The speed test of the players is being done here with the help of a device called Speed gate
 khilaadi form main hai or ek duusare ko pachhaadne kii hode main bhi
 The team's great forwards, SV Sunil, Sreejesh and Lalit are ranked number one by beating players
 match ke dauraan apni speed ke sahare sunil kai baar vipakshi tiimon main khof paidaa karte rahe hai
 The hockey team and the controversy are behind each other like shadows
 iskaa asar team kii sehat par kuch bhi naa padaa ho ise sirf aadhikarik taur jari bayaan hi mana ja saktaa he
 The responsibility of recovering the physical and mental health of the team has increased more than ever on the support staff of the team
 dach coach rolent oltmens behad maahir coach maane jate hai
 He has the distinction of helping the Holland team succeed in the Olympics, World Cup and Champions Trophy
 pichley qareeb teen saal se wo bhartiya team ke saath hai parformens diarector ke taur par jude rahe hai
 But the responsibility of the coach of Team Hockey India has suddenly come on them
 1 The good thing is that the coach and the players have taken this change positively
 coach kehete hai ki unhen team kaa andaaza he or team ko unke bare main maaloom he
 So it cannot be said that they are starting from zero
 coach oltmens ko kamyaabi kaa fan maaloom he
 They take care of every nuance of the team and the player
 maidan par ek general kii bhoomika main hote hai to maidan ke baahar khilaadiyon ke khan-paan se lekar neend tak kaa puraa khyaal rakhte hai
 The players are beginning to understand why and what the coaches expect from them in the camp
 team hockey india ne beete ek saal main kai aisi kamyaabi hasil kii jisane hockey fans main badi ummid jagaai
 Defeating Pakistan in the final of the Incheon Asiad or defeating a team like Holland in the Champions Trophy in Bhubaneswar gave wings to the team's morale
 isi hausale ke sahare is team ne ajalan shah cap main australia jaisi team ko shikast de di
 Despite almost half a dozen players not fully fit in the World Hockey League semi-finals held in Belgium, the team stood fourth after Australia, Belgium and Britain
 lekin hockey ke adhikariyon ne is kamyaabi ko carat main badalane main der nahin lagaai
 It is another matter that players and coaches started talking about recovering from this loss as fast as possible
 1980 ke aakhri olympic medal ko hasil kiye 35 saal biit gaye hai
 Since then, the wait for the Olympic medal has been increasing
 shahrukh kii chak de parde par chaahe jitani hit rahi he bhartiya team ke liye sahi myne main chak de kehane kii chunauti barqaraar he
 The Olympic rate Olympics These teams keep increasing
 maujuuda team ek ummid jagaati he
 If the experts praise the merits of the team, then there is also a hint of deficiencies
 coach oltmens ne team hockey india kii penlti corner ko lekar bhi chintaa jataai he
 Indian drag flickers are considered great, but it is important to know how much they have compared to other countries of the world
 england ke eshle jackson, australia ke Chris Ciriello or germany ke philip jailer duniya ke maahir draig filkars maane jate hai
 The team as strong as drag flickers
 
 
 wo team utani hi kaamyaab! landan olympix se abtak bharat ne abtak top das tiimon ke kilaaf 67 maichon main 120 gol kiye or 176 gol khaaye! in 120 gol main 34 gol penlti corner ke zariye aaye
 India scored 24 penalty corners during the Champions Trophy and World Hockey League tournaments, in which the team scored just 9 goals
 jabaki bharat ke kilaaf inhen toornament main 41 penlti corner bane jinamein 14 gol hue
 Creating a penalty corner and turning it into a goal has proved to be a weak link for Team India in the recent tournament
 is ek kami ko dur kar bhartiya team bade kitaab jeet sakati he
 Experts say that the Indian team has power in the battery of short corner specialist but coaches Altmans are looking for other specialist besides Raghunath and Bob ie Rupinder
 gurjindar or jasjit jaise khilaadi achche vikalp ke taur par ubhar rahe hai
 Rupinder and VR Raghunath believe that the direction of their practice is right and they are expecting a lot from themselves and the team
 alag setapis, alag combination kii talash kii ja rahi he taaki bade maichon main iskaa bada faaydaa utaya ja sake
 Forward players are being told the tricks of penalty corner technique
 tippaniyan The team can definitely get the benefit of high altitude training at Shilaru at an altitude of 8000 ft above sea level
 lekin olympic ke podium kii oonchai tak pahunchane se pehle team kii chunautiyaan behad bad gai hai jiskaa jawaab puure hockey tantra ko dhundhna padegaa
 It can be said that no matter what the situation outside the field
 
 
 maidan par team kaa utsaah badhane laga he
 No lack of passion
 fokas pich par he or nazren podium par
 More than a year ago, much of the movement was in the offices to prepare for the Rio Olympics

 India scored 24 penalty corners during the Champions Trophy and World Hockey League tournaments, in which the team scored just 9 goals
 jabaki bharat ke kilaaf inhen toornament main 41 penlti corner bane jinamein 14 gol hue
 Creating a penalty corner and turning it into a goal has proved to be a weak link for Team India in the recent tournament
 is ek kami ko dur kar bhartiya team bade kitaab jeet sakati he
 Experts say that the Indian team has power in the battery of short corner specialist but coaches Altmans are looking for other specialist besides Raghunath and Bob ie Rupinder
 gurjindar or jasjit jaise khilaadi achche vikalp ke taur par ubhar rahe hai
 Rupinder and VR Raghunath believe that the direction of their practice is right and they are expecting a lot from themselves and the team
 alag setapis, alag combination kii talash kii ja rahi he taaki bade maichon main iskaa bada faaydaa utaya ja sake
 Forward players are being told the tricks of penalty corner technique

 At the Shilaru Hockey Camp, a whirlwind of controversies was left behind
 olympic se ek saal pehle hockey team ek baar phir se sanvarne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Every member of the team seems to be trying to make the atmosphere at least positive
 pahadiyon se ghire shilaru hockey camp main ek alag beficri he
 The focus is only on the ball, the player and the goalpost
 yahaan team kaa fitaness test kiya ja rahaa he
 Fitness is considered the mantra of team success in modern hockey
 is test main har beep ke saath khilaadiyon ko apni speed badhaani he
 At an altitude of 8000 feet, it is difficult to walk fast
 
 
 ye behad mushkil test he
 Only 5 players out of 33 remain on the 19 beep
 phir do or phir sirf gurbaj
 Been in the race to prove himself like Gurbaz
 shaayad wo ye bhi sabit karnaa chaahate hai ki unpar laga anushaasanheenata kaa tamgaa unke manobal ko nahin tod saktaa
 Gurbaz is the star midfielder of the team and the captain and coach understand his importance well
 sardaar kehete hai ki gurbaj team ke behad ahm khilaadi hai lekin wo maanate hai ki team sabase upar he
 Coach Altmans says that this issue is more about understanding and knowledge than indiscipline in the team
 shilaru main team kaa yo-yo test bhi kiya gaya
 One of the most senior players of the team, Gurbaj Singh topped it, one of the youngest players of the team, Aamir Khan was second
 senior or junior khilaadiyon ke bich kaa ye faaslaa shaayad team kii sabase badi taaqat he
 That is, 26-year-old Gurbaz and 22-year-old Aamir Khan are as fit as the top teams in the world, Australia, Holland or Germany
 lekin team ke australian fitaness trainer mathew iles (mat) abhi isse santusht nahin
 At Shilaru's high altitude training camp, he keeps on encouraging the players to get beyond their limits
 wo maanate hai ki team ke kai khilaadi behad fit hai
 They praise the fitness of players like Dharmaveer, Kothajit, Chinglensana, Gurbaj
 lekin unka kahana he ki isamen or bhi sudhaar kii ganjaish he
 Matt knows that in order to keep the enthusiasm of the players, he will also have to compete with them
 isliye practice ke baad coach tushaar khandekar ke saath res main khud ko aazamaa rahe hai
 But in the race, the game gets beaten
 vaise bhi tushaar ne haal hi main khilaadi se coach banane kaa safar tay kiya he isliye unki fitaness kaa level thodaa behatar he
 Speed determines the ability of a hockey team

 Dutch coach Rolant Altmans is considered a highly skilled coach

 The coach says that he has an idea of the team and the team knows about him

 Team Hockey India achieved many such successes in the last one year which raised great hope in Hockey Fans
 inchiyan asiad ke final main pakistan ko haraana yaa phir bhubaneshwar main hui champions trophy main holland jaisi team ko shikast dene se team ke hausalon ko pankh lag gaye
 With this encouragement, this team defeated a team like Australia in Azlan Shah Cup
 belgium main hui world hockey lig semifinal main qareeb aadhe darjan khilaadiyon ke puri tarah se fit nahin hone ke baavjood ye team australia, belgium or britain ke baad chauthe number par rahi
 But hockey officials did not take long to convert this success into a carat
 ye or baat he ki khilaadi or coach utani hi tezi se is nuksaan se ubarne kii baat karne lage
 35 years have passed since the last Olympic medal was won in 1980
 tab se lekar abtak olympic medal ko lekar intazaar badhata ja rahaa he
 Shahrukh's Chak De is as much a hit on screen as it is a challenge for the Indian team to truly say Chak De

 The current team raises an expectation
 jaankaar team kii khoobiyon kii taareef karte hai to kamiyon kii ore ishaara bhi miltaa rahaa he
 Coach Altmans has also raised concerns about Team Hockey India's penalty corner

 Ashley Jackson of England, Chris Ciriello of Australia and Philip Zeller of Germany are considered the world's leading drag filmmakers
 jis team ke draig flikars jitne damdaar
 
 
 That team was equally successful! India has scored 120 goals and scored 176 goals in 67 matches against the top ten teams from London Olympics so far! Of these 120 goals, 34 goals came through penalty corners
 bharat ne champions trophy or world hockey lig toornament ke dauraan 24 penlti corner ke mauqe banaaye jinamein is team ne sirf 9 gol kiye
 While 41 penalty corners were scored in these tournament against India in which 14 goals were scored
 penlti corner bananaa or use gol main tabdeel karnaa haal ke toornament main team india kii kamazor kadi sabit hui he
 By removing this one deficiency, the Indian team can win a big title
 jaankaar kehete hai ki bhartiya team kii short corner specialist kii bydaree main dam to he lekin coach oltmens raghunatha or bob yani rupinder ke alaava bhi duusare specialist kii talash main hai
 Players like Gurjinder and Jasjeet are emerging as good options
 rupinder or viaar raghunatha maanate hai ki unki abhyaas kii disha sahi he or wo khud se or team se badi ummid rakh rahe hai
 Separate setpieces, separate combinations are being looked for so that it can be exploited in big matches

 The comments samudr tal se 8000 fit kii oonchai par shilaru main hai oltitude training kaa kaa faaydaa team ko zarur mil saktaa he
 But before the Olympics reach the height of the podium, the team's challenges have increased immensely, the answer will be to find the entire hockey system

 Sardar says that Gurbaz is a very important player in the team but he believes that the team is at the top
 coach oltmens kehete hai ki team main anushaasanheenata se zyaada ye masalaa samajhadaari or jaankaree kaa he
 The team's yo-yo test was also done at Shilaru
 team ke sabase senior khilaadiyon main se ek gurbaj singh isamen awwal rahe to team ke sabase yuva khilaadiyon main se ek aamir khan duusare number par rahe
 This gap between senior and junior players is probably the biggest strength of the team
 yani 26 saal ke gurbaj or 22 saal ke aamir khan utane hi fit hai jitna ki duniya kii top team australia, holland yaa germany ke khilaadi hai
 But the team's Australian fitness trainer Matthew Isles (matt) is not satisfied yet

 But he says that there is scope for further improvement
 mat jaanate hai ki khilaadiyon kaa utsaah banaaye rakhane ke liye unhen khud bhi unase compit karnaa hoga
 Therefore, after practice, the coach is trying himself in the race with Tusshar Khandekar

 But before the Olympics reach the height of the podium, the team's challenges have increased immensely, the answer will be to find the entire hockey system
 itnaa zarur kaha ja saktaa he ki maidan ke baahar halaat chaahe jaise bhi hon
 
 
 The enthusiasm of the team on the field is increasing
 josh kii kami nahin
 Focus is on the pitch and eyes on the podium
 mat jaanate hai ki khilaadiyon kaa utsaah banaaye rakhane ke liye unhen khud bhi unase compit karnaa hoga
 Therefore, after practice, the coach is trying himself in the race with Tusshar Khandekar
 lekin res main tushaar baazi maar jate hai
 Anyway, Tushar has recently decided to go from player to coach, so his fitness level is slightly better
 speed, hockey team kii kaabiliyat tay karti he
 There have been many instances when the Indian team has been seen losing matches in the last moments
 aaj khilaadiyon kii raftaar kaa imtihaan he
 The speed test of the players is being done here with the help of a device called Speed gate
 khilaadi form main hai or ek duusare ko pachhaadne kii hode main bhi
 The team's great forwards, SV Sunil, Sreejesh and Lalit are ranked number one by beating players
 match ke dauraan apni speed ke sahare sunil kai baar vipakshi tiimon main khof paidaa karte rahe hai
 The hockey team and the controversy are behind each other like shadows
 iskaa asar team kii sehat par kuch bhi naa padaa ho ise sirf aadhikarik taur jari bayaan hi mana ja saktaa he
 The responsibility of recovering the physical and mental health of the team has increased more than ever on the support staff of the team
 dach coach rolent oltmens behad maahir coach maane jate hai
 He has the distinction of helping the Holland team succeed in the Olympics, World Cup and Champions Trophy
 pichley qareeb teen saal se wo bhartiya team ke saath hai parformens diarector ke taur par jude rahe hai
 But the responsibility of the coach of Team Hockey India has suddenly come on them
 1 The good thing is that the coach and the players have taken this change positively
 coach kehete hai ki unhen team kaa andaaza he or team ko unke bare main maaloom he
 So it cannot be said that they are starting from zero
 coach oltmens ko kamyaabi kaa fan maaloom he
 They take care of every nuance of the team and the player
 maidan par ek general kii bhoomika main hote hai to maidan ke baahar khilaadiyon ke khan-paan se lekar neend tak kaa puraa khyaal rakhte hai
 The players are beginning to understand why and what the coaches expect from them in the camp
 team hockey india ne beete ek saal main kai aisi kamyaabi hasil kii jisane hockey fans main badi ummid jagaai
 Defeating Pakistan in the final of the Incheon Asiad or defeating a team like Holland in the Champions Trophy in Bhubaneswar gave wings to the team's morale
 isi hausale ke sahare is team ne ajalan shah cap main australia jaisi team ko shikast de di
 Despite almost half a dozen players not fully fit in the World Hockey League semi-finals held in Belgium, the team stood fourth after Australia, Belgium and Britain
 lekin hockey ke adhikariyon ne is kamyaabi ko carat main badalane main der nahin lagaai
 It is another matter that players and coaches started talking about recovering from this loss as fast as possible
 1980 ke aakhri olympic medal ko hasil kiye 35 saal biit gaye hai
 Since then, the wait for the Olympic medal has been increasing
 shahrukh kii chak de parde par chaahe jitani hit rahi he bhartiya team ke liye sahi myne main chak de kehane kii chunauti barqaraar he
 The Olympic rate Olympics These teams keep increasing
 maujuuda team ek ummid jagaati he
 If the experts praise the merits of the team, then there is also a hint of deficiencies
 coach oltmens ne team hockey india kii penlti corner ko lekar bhi chintaa jataai he
 Indian drag flickers are considered great, but it is important to know how much they have compared to other countries of the world
 england ke eshle jackson, australia ke Chris Ciriello or germany ke philip jailer duniya ke maahir draig filkars maane jate hai
 The team as strong as drag flickers
 
 
 wo team utani hi kaamyaab! landan olympix se abtak bharat ne abtak top das tiimon ke kilaaf 67 maichon main 120 gol kiye or 176 gol khaaye! in 120 gol main 34 gol penlti corner ke zariye aaye
 India scored 24 penalty corners during the Champions Trophy and World Hockey League tournaments, in which the team scored just 9 goals
 jabaki bharat ke kilaaf inhen toornament main 41 penlti corner bane jinamein 14 gol hue
 Creating a penalty corner and turning it into a goal has proved to be a weak link for Team India in the recent tournament
 is ek kami ko dur kar bhartiya team bade kitaab jeet sakati he
 Experts say that the Indian team has power in the battery of short corner specialist but coaches Altmans are looking for other specialist besides Raghunath and Bob ie Rupinder
 gurjindar or jasjit jaise khilaadi achche vikalp ke taur par ubhar rahe hai
 Rupinder and VR Raghunath believe that the direction of their practice is right and they are expecting a lot from themselves and the team
 alag setapis, alag combination kii talash kii ja rahi he taaki bade maichon main iskaa bada faaydaa utaya ja sake
 Forward players are being told the tricks of penalty corner technique
 tippaniyan The team can definitely get the benefit of high altitude training at Shilaru at an altitude of 8000 ft above sea level

 Ashley Jackson of England, Chris Ciriello of Australia and Philip Zeller of Germany are considered the world's leading drag filmmakers
 jis team ke draig flikars jitne damdaar
 
 
 That team was equally successful! India has scored 120 goals and scored 176 goals in 67 matches against the top ten teams from London Olympics so far! Of these 120 goals, 34 goals came through penalty corners
 bharat ne champions trophy or world hockey lig toornament ke dauraan 24 penlti corner ke mauqe banaaye jinamein is team ne sirf 9 gol kiye
 While 41 penalty corners were scored in these tournament against India in which 14 goals were scored
 penlti corner bananaa or use gol main tabdeel karnaa haal ke toornament main team india kii kamazor kadi sabit hui he
 By removing this one deficiency, the Indian team can win a big title
 jaankaar kehete hai ki bhartiya team kii short corner specialist kii bydaree main dam to he lekin coach oltmens raghunatha or bob yani rupinder ke alaava bhi duusare specialist kii talash main hai
 Players like Gurjinder and Jasjeet are emerging as good options
 rupinder or viaar raghunatha maanate hai ki unki abhyaas kii disha sahi he or wo khud se or team se badi ummid rakh rahe hai
 Separate setpieces, separate combinations are being looked for so that it can be exploited in big matches

 The comments samudr tal se 8000 fit kii oonchai par shilaru main hai oltitude training kaa kaa faaydaa team ko zarur mil saktaa he
 But before the Olympics reach the height of the podium, the team's challenges have increased immensely, the answer will be to find the entire hockey system

 Despite almost half a dozen players not fully fit in the World Hockey League semi-finals held in Belgium, the team stood fourth after Australia, Belgium and Britain
 lekin hockey ke adhikariyon ne is kamyaabi ko carat main badalane main der nahin lagaai
 It is another matter that players and coaches started talking about recovering from this loss as fast as possible

 India scored 24 penalty corners during the Champions Trophy and World Hockey League tournaments, in which the team scored just 9 goals
 jabaki bharat ke kilaaf inhen toornament main 41 penlti corner bane jinamein 14 gol hue
 Creating a penalty corner and turning it into a goal has proved to be a weak link for Team India in the recent tournament

 Experts say that the Indian team has power in the battery of short corner specialist but coaches Altmans are looking for other specialist besides Raghunath and Bob ie Rupinder

 Rupinder and VR Raghunath believe that the direction of their practice is right and they are expecting a lot from themselves and the team

 Forward players are being told the tricks of penalty corner technique

 The Delhi High Court has said that it is a fundamental right of every citizen to get a passport in his name and travel abroad
 adaalat ne aisi tippanee karne ke saath hi teen baar passport khone vaale vyakti ko passport jari karne kaa centre sarkaar ko nirdesh diya he
 a bench of Justice Manmohan directed the Ministry of External Affairs and the Regional Office concerned that the petitioner A
 vikaas ke liye phir se passport jari kiya jaae
 Also, the court told the petitioner that he did not take care of his passport, so he should give charitable 50 thousand rupees to the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital
 nyaayamurti manmohan ne kaha, 'yachikakarta ke vakil ko sunne or mukademe kii file ke avlokan ke baad is adaalat kaa yah maananaa he ki videsh janaa or apane naam kaa passport praapt karnaa prayek naagarik kaa moulik adhikaar he
 The court said that the existing petition and application are accepted and the defendants are directed to give the petitioner a new passport again or as an alternative
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki bataate hai ki yachikakarta kaa bhai bhi australia main basaa hua he
 In such a situation, not giving the passport to the petitioner would violate his fundamental right
 chauthi baar jari hua tha passportyachikakarta ke anusaar usne teen baar apana passport kho diya he or use kshetreey karyaalay ne chauthi baar passport jari kiya tha
 But he returned it in a damaged condition
 yachikakarta ne court main kaha ki usne jaanboojhkar na to passport ganvaaya he or na hi ise kshatigrast kiya he or usne to shantipurna tareeke se alpavadhi ke liye kuch deshon kii yatra kii hai
 The Ministry of External Affairs opposed the plea of the petitioner, stating that it had failed to preserve a valuable official document
 lekin nyaayalay ne is daleel ko sweekaar nahin kiya, lekin apane passport kaa uchit dhyaan nahin rakhane ke chalate nyaayalay ne vikaas ko 50,000 rupee aspataal main dharmarth jamaa karne kaa aadesh diya
 Vinay Katiyar, a BJP leader and one of the leaders of the Ram Mandir movement, has denied any attempt to compromise on the transaction of money
 aaj tak samvaadadaata se baatcheet main vinay katiyaar ne kaha ki aasthaa kaa sauda nahin kiya ja saktaa
 People who are talking like this do not know the Ayodhya dispute
 farji log samjhaute main paise kii baat kar rahevinay katiyaar ke mutabik farji log samjhaute main paise kii baat kar rahe hai
 Such people have nothing to do with this movement, nor with the agreement of the Ayodhya dispute
 shri shri ravishankarpani taraf se pahal jarur kar rahe hai, magar is pahal se ummid dikhaai nahin detii
 This is because there is little scope for anyone to give up their claims by negotiation
 sunni shiya vakf board ko paison kaa lalachashri shri ravishankar kii ore se ram mandir mudde par baatcheet kii pahal ke bich ek bada khulaasa hua he
 Mahant Dinendra Das of Nirmohi Akhara, a party on the Ram temple issue, said that the Sunni Waqf Board can be given Rs 1 crore to Rs 20 crore for the agreement
 gauratlab he ki shri shri ravishankar aaj hi ayodhya pahunch rahe hai or is dauraan aisa khulaasa unke prayaason ko gahari chot pahunchaa saktaa he
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar said on Wednesday that he has no proposal, he just wants to bring everyone along

 Please tell that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has arrived in Ayodhya on Thursday
 ishrat jahaan encounter cese main ek or bada bayaan saamne aayaa he
 Sudhir Kumar, who was the Special Director (west Zone) of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) at the time of the case, told India Today that the IB input of Ishrat Jahan's link to lashkar-e-taiba was correct
 is input ko tab gujarat sarkaar ko bheja gaya tha
 Earlier, two former Home Secretaries also spoke of political pressure on this case and direct intervention of the then Home Minister p Chidambaram
 raajnneeti kii vajah se aatank se sangharsh par asarkumar ne kaha ki cmand ke bi chen or sarkaar ko ishrat ke lashkar e taiyaba link ke bare main chaukanna kar diya gaya tha
 During that time, the morale of the IB officers in the field was affected by the politically motivated investigation of the case
 unhone kaha ki ibi kii top leadership or sarkaar kii vajah se aatank virdohi muhim ko nicha dekhnaa padaa
 Politics on terrorism weakens the machinery to fight terrorism
 ishrat par hedli kii pushti kii jarurat nahinkumar ne kaha ki hamen ishrat ke lashkar link ke bare main hedli kii pushti kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 We were getting to know this from many sources
 ishrat jahaan or lashkar ke modul donon ko gujarat or maharashtra main monitor kiya ja rahaa tha
 The then Joint Director of IB Rajendra Kumar and other officers did a better job in this case, but we were unfairly targeted
 affidavit badalakar buree tarah ghire chidambaramishrat jahaan muthbhed cese main congress netaa pi chidambaram ke raajnneetik bayanon ke baad purv grih sachiv ji ke pillai ne phir hamalaa bolaa he
 Pillai said that Chidambaram, while being Home Minister, bypassed me in the Ishrat case and got the affidavit ready again according to his mind
 phir ise supreme court main pesh kiya
 The second affidavit was written by Chidambaram on a news channel
 In 2009, Chidambaram summoned my junior officers of the IB to get the affidavit completely rewritten
 ab vah khud bolkar ise likhva rahe the to koi bhi kuch nahin bol sakaa
 Pillai said that Chidambaram should not hold the Home Secretary or the IB responsible for these things
 khulaase ke baad hamalavar hui bijepiiske kuch din pehle bhi pillai ne kaha tha ki ishrat jahaan encounter cese ke affidavit ko rajnithik kaarnon se badal diya gaya tha
 After this, BJP accused Chidambaram of being the Home Minister, according to the Congress, to change the affidavit, targeting Narendra Modi and the Gujarat government, taking political revenge from the BJP and compromising national security for political gains
 congress ke stand par the chidambarambijapi ne kaha tha ki ishrat ko begunaah or gujarat police ko farji encounter kaa aaropee ghoshit karnaa congress kaa stand tha
 Chidambaram misused the position to justify it and made a radical change in the affidavit
 pillai ko mila aar ke singh kaa saathis bich pillai ke baad grih sachiv bane aar ko singh ne bhi is baat kii pushti kii ki ishrat jahaan encounter cese main affidavit ko badla gaya tha
 It was earlier recorded that Ishrat and her three accomplices killed in the encounter were terrorists associated with lashkar-e-taiba
 baad main yah tathy gaayab ho gaya
 BJP MP Singh said that despite the IB saying the changes were made due to political reasons
 sin karne vaale par tha sibiai kaa dabaawais bich ek angreji akhbaar segrih mantralayake purv under secretary (aantarik suraksha) kaha aarvies mani ne kaha ki duusare affidavit par usase jabardastee sin karwaae gaye the
 He was pressurized by CBI for this
 mani ne 2013 main bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki affidavit par sin karne ke liye unpar sibiai kaa dabaav tha
 In 2004, the Ashrat Jahan encounter took place in 19 years when Ishrat Jahan and three of his associates were killed in an encounter by Gujarat Police near Ahmedabad in 2004
 police ke mutabik ki ye sabhi lashkar e taiyaba se jude aatanki the
 They all came there to execute the plot to kill the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi
 chidambaram bole- affidavit badalane main pillai bhi jimmedaarchidambaram par hamalavar hue pillai ne saaf-saaf kaha ki chidambaram ko maan lenaa chahie ki effitaveit ko badalane kaa faisla sirf unka tha
 There was no intention of IB or Home Secretary for this
 somvaar ko chidambaram ne ise kabool to kiya tha ki affidavit main unhone badlaav kiya tha
 He had said that he had made the right changes and Pillai also had an equal role in it
 grih mantralay karegaa sabhi filon kii dobaaraa jaanchachidambaram ne apni safai main kaha tha ki pehla affidavit ke spasht nahin hone kii vajah se doosraa affidavit dena padaa
 He also expressed deep disappointment over Pillai shying away from the case
 in khulaason ke baad kendriya grih mantralay ne ishrat jahaan encounter cese kisbhi filon kii phir se jaanchakarne kaa faisla liya he
 Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has rejected the bjp's proposal to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 is bare main ganguli ne saaf kaha he ki unka kaam maidan main he, kahin or nahin
 There were reports that BJP had promised Ganguly that if he wins and a BJP government is formed, Ganguly will be made the Sports Minister of the country
 haalanki bhaajapa netaa varun gandhi kaa kahana he ki saurav se baaten jarur hui thim, lekin ise badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 West Bengal BJP President Rahul Sinha told PTI that party leader Varun Gandhi had met Ganguly in mid-november through a friend, after which the proposal was discussed
 sinha ne kaha, unhone ganguli ko peshkash kii
 BJP national general secretary Varun Gandhi is also an observer of the party in West Bengal
 jab sinha se us akhbaar kii report par pratikriya karne ke liye poocha gaya, jisamen kaha gaya he ki yah peshkash bhartiya janata party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne kii he, jinhone party ke centre main satta main aane par bengal ke is diggaj khilaadi ko cabinet main khelmantri banane kaa vaada kiya he, to unhone isse inkaar kiya
 Sinha said, it is all a lie
 pashchim bengal main loksabhaa kii 42 siten hai, jisamen bhaajapa kii ekmaatr seat darjeeling main he
 However, Ganguly could not be reacted to this report
 kerala ke pamolin cese kaa trial jari rahegaa jisamen sivisi pije thomas aaropee he

 Cambridge Analytica, a firm that helped Donald Trump in the US presidential election, has been accused of stealing personal information from about 50 million Facebook users
 is jaankaree ko kathith taur par chunaav ke dauraan trump ko jitaane main sahyog or virdohi kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye istemaal kiya gaya he
 This is being called the biggest data leak in the history of Facebook
 aaie jaanate hai ki kaise hua data li kaa yah maamla puraa maamla or kis tarah se iskaa chunaav main istemaal kiya gaya
 Be careful with such apps: You will also get requests for all the interesting apps through Facebook, which are requested to allow your personal data access to download or proceed with them
 aise main aapako apane data acces dene main saavdhaanee baratani hogi, kyonki data churaane kaa puraa khel yaheen se chal rahaa he
 These data were easily obtained by Cambridge Analytica (CA) using an application developed by another company, Global Science Research (GSR)
 saal 2014 main jiesar ne ek persenality quij ap 'disaijayoradigitalalife' shuru kiya, ise kuch 'manovaigyanikon' dwaara kiye jane vaala prayog bataaya gaya
 The application, which surfaced through Facebook, was downloaded by 2,70,000 people
 downlod karne vaale graahakon kaa fasebuk data sie ke paas pahunch gaya
 This application was actually completely against Facebook's developer policy
 lekin fasebuk ne ise roka nahin or iske dwaara logon kii data churaane or use dusron ko bechney kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 In this way, with the download of only 2,70,000 people, CA gained access to their entire friendlist and got information about about 5 crore users without their permission
 chunaav main kaise madad karti he companycambridge analitica (sie) kaa daawa he ki vah 'logon ke vyavhaar main badlaav se mili data kaa adhyayan karti he or apane client ko chunaav jitaane main madad ke liye unhen jaruri data or uskaa vishleshan muhaiyaa karaati he
 For this, she uses estimating analytics, behavioral science and data-based advertising technology
 company yugers ke data bade paimaane par hasil kar voters ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karti he or soshal media tathaa digital plateform par apane lakshith vigyapanon or abhiyaanon ke dwaara unhen prabhavit karne kii bhi koshish karti he
 Although CA is active in many countries including India, its biggest achievement so far has been to work for the Republican Party in the 2016 US presidential elections and help Trump win
 aisa mana jaataa he ki company ne bina kisi khaas jhukaav vaale voters kii pahchaan kii or unhen trump ke paksh main karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 a massive victory for Nitish! The company has claimed that it helped Nitish Kumar get a landslide victory in the 2010 Bihar assembly elections
 is tarah ek baar phir se soshal media par data kii suraksha or fasebuk kii usamen bhoomika ko lekar sawaal khadey hone shuru ho gaye hai
 Cambridge Analytica has revealed that in 2010 its parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) helped Nitish Kumar's party Janata Dal u in Bihar win a landslide victory
 company kaa daawa he ki usne jin bhi siton par kaam kiya, unamem se 90 fisadi par party ko jeet hasil hui he
 How does the company influence voters? The company claims that the political campaign it runs is based on the personal data of legally acquired people
 sie kaa daawa he ki america ke 23 karod voters ke bich usne 5,000 data poit kaa istemaal kiya or unke bilkul upyukt profile taiyaar kiye taaki baad main lakshith vigyapanon ke dwaara un tak pahunchaa ja sake
 However, it has been revealed from various media reports and stings that CA has acquired these data in an unethical manner
 fasebuk ko iske bare main pataa tha!vaise to fasebuk is data li main apni kisi bhi bhoomika se inkaar kar rahi he, lekin yah jitne bade paimaane par hua he, ussecompanypuri tarah se apni jimmedaari se pallaa nahin jhaad sakati
 According to the New York Times, Facebook had long been aware of data theft, but instead of making it public, it contacted CA through its lawyers
 sie ne fasebuk ko aashwaasan diya ki usne sabhi data ko delit kar diya he
 But the newspaper revealed that the data copies still remain with CA

 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jin rajyon main bhi vidhansabha chunaav hue hai, unamem zyaadaatar rajyon main satta virdohi lahar dekhne ko mili he
 The defeat of BJP in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan assembly elections and Congress's defeat in Mizoram is also a result of this trend
 jabaki telugana main kesiar apni satta ko bachaae rakhane main safal rahe
 The BJP was in power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for the last 15 years
 jabaki rajasthan main vasundhara raaje ke netritv main 2013 main vaapasi kii thi, lekin paanch saal ke baad ek baar phir unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 In this way, the three BJP ruled states have faced anti-incumbency and the Congress seems to be in power in these states
 2014 main shuru hui sattavirohi laharbata den ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main manmohan singh ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ke khilaaf jabardast satta virdohi lahar dekhne ko mili thi
 Due to various scams including 2G spectrum, coal block allocation and Commonwealth Games, people voted against Manmohan Singh and under the leadership of Narendra Modi, BJP was handed over the power of the country
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pehla vidhansabha chunaav dilli main hua
 Out of 70 assembly seats in the state, the Aam Aadmi Party got 67 seats
 dilli kaa janadesh bijepi or congress donon ke khilaaf chalaa gaya
 The Congress could not even open an account in Delhi elections
 desh ke jin rajyon main sattarudh dal ke khilaaf janadesh gaya, unamem adhikansh rajyon main congress satta par kabiz thi
 In such a situation, the Grand Old Party had to face the anti-incumbency wave in many states
 isi ke chalate congress ko kai rajyon main apni satta ganvaani padi thi
 At the same time, now BJP also had to face defeat due to similar anti-incumbency wave
 congress ko ganvaane pade ye rajyagauratlab he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad maharashtra, haryana, assam, andhra pradesh, jharkhand, uttarakhand or himachal pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav hue hai
 All these states had Congress governments and had to face anti-incumbency
 karnataka chunaav main bhi yahi hua
 One by one the power of the state was slipped from the hands of the Congress
 vahiin, punjab main akali dal or bijepi gathbandhan kii sarkaar ko satta ke khilaaf chali lahar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or upi main akhilesh yadav ko bhi aise hi trend kii vajah se satta ganvaani padi
 In Andhra Pradesh, TDP gained power by defeating Congress and YSR Congress

 bangala khaali nahin karne par gahalot sarkaar ne thoka jurmaanasarkaar kaa farmaan- khaali karen, nahin to den roj 10,000rajasthan hoicourt ne kaha tha ki purv mukhyamantriyon kaa bangala khaali karaao
 Former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's bungalow was not vacant but the government has imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on daily basis for not vacating the bungalow of two leaders who are considered to be vicious opponents of Vasundhara
 bina ijaajat sarkari bangale par kabja jamaaye baithe rahane ke aarope main bijepi saansad kirodi laal meena or bhairon singh shekhavat ke damaad va bijepi vidhayak narpat singh rajvi par 10 hajaar rupee pratidin ke hisaab se jurmaana lagaaya gaya he
 Both of them will have to pay the fine from the date of August 23 of the previous month, as the government had given the notice to vacate the bungalow on August 23
 narpat singh rajvi ne nahin choda banglarajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri or desh ke purv uparashtrapati bhairon singh shekhavat ko civil lines kaa bangala number D-14 aavantit kiya gaya tha, jisamen unke vidhayak damaad narpat singh rajvi rah rahe the
 After the death of Bhairav singh Shekhawat, his wife Suraj Qamar was allotted this bungalow
 magar suraj kanvar kii mrityu ke baad bhi narpat singh rajvi ne yah bangala nahin choda tha
 On the contrary, when Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot refused to accept the order of Rajasthan High Court to vacate the bungalow of former chief ministers, Abhimanyu Singh Rajvi, son of Narpat Singh Rajvi tweeted and congratulated him on his generosity
 haalanki yah twit kii dariyaadilii zyada din thahari nahin or ab jurmaana inhen bharna hoga
 Act applicable to former CM, not to MLA: Rajvirajvi said in a conversation with 'aaj Tak', 'he will not vacate the bungalow, because the government's act is applicable to former ministers and i am an MLA
 bhairon singh shekhavat ke naam par yah bangala aavantit he
 As per the law applicable to former Chief Ministers, i am their adopted son and also an MLA, so i have every right to live in this bungalow
 'rajvi ne kaha ki vasundhara raaje ke samay yah khaali karne ke liye mukadmaa kiya gaya tha magar ashok gahalot se hamaare paariwarik sambandh he or vah ek samvedansheel insaan he
 Evacuating for political reasons: Meenaudhar bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Kirodi Lal Meena is on one side plaguing the Gehlot government
 duusari taraf avaidh rup se bangala bhi jamaaye baithe the
 That is why the Gehlot government has also treated them
 kirodi laal meena kaa kahana he ki mujhe jaan kaa khatra tha
 Therefore, this bungalow was given and changes were made in terms of security, but due to political reasons i am being evacuated
 kirodi laal meena pehali vasundhara sarkaar main jab khaadya aapurti mantri the to aspataal road kaa yah bangala mila tha
 After quarreling with Vasundhara Raje, she left the cabinet, but did not leave the bungalow
 uske baad unki patni golmaa devi gahalot sarkaar main mantri baniin to bangala unke paas rah gaya
 Despite the figure of 36 from Vasundhara Raje in the previous government, this bungalow remained in the name of his legislator wife Golma Devi, but this time Golma Devi has lost the election
 lihaaja sarkaar ne in par bhi bangala nahin khaali karne ke liye jurmaana thok diya he
 Kirori Lal Meena is not in the mood to vacate the bungalow and will deal with the government in court
 bhartiya team newjiland ke khilaaf hone vaali teen test kii siries jeetne ke liye fevorett rahegi, ye kahana he ek, do nahin balki paanch diggajon kaa
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Kapil Dev, Sourav Ganguly, Mohammad Azharuddin, VVS Laxman and former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee have said before the start of the series that it would be almost impossible for the Kiwi team to beat host India at home
 brett lee kaa kahana he ki 'viraat kohli kii timanujilandco haraa degi, bhartiya khilaadi in pichon par acha pradarshan karne main maahir hai, viraat ek behtareen captain hai or unke paas jabardast ballebaaj hai
 i think only and only Kane Williamson can shock India
 'guuruuvaar ko kanpur main pehla test match shuru ho rahaa he or kapil dev kaa maananaa he ki sabhi kii nazren green park kii pich par rahengi
 Kapil said that 'the Indian team has the strings so that they can easily win the match
 lekin, newzealand ko itnaa halke main bhi nahin aankna chahie
 Many of his players have played a lot in India
 is saal world tii20 main bhi unhone acha pradarshan kiya tha
 You cannot say that he will kneel easily on the turning wicket
 pich paanch din tak sahi kheli to acha lagegaa kyonki agar teen din main hi match khatm ho jaataa he to phir toss jeetne vaali team kaa palada baari ho jaataa he
 'team India will win if played according to the potential, while VVS Laxman also said that if Team India put all its strength, the victory is not far away
 unhone kaha ki 'mujhe lagata he kanpur main acha wicket milanaa chahie
 If the Indian team plays according to their potential then they will definitely win
 haalanki main world tii20 main unke spinners michel santner or ish sodhi ke pradarshan se kaaphi prabhavit hua tha
 'he believed that if the ball moves more, the problems will increase for the batsmen as well
 newjiland ke liye badi chunautilakshmana ne ye bhi kaha he ki 'mujhe lagata he ki ballebaajon ko zyaada sangharsh karnaa padegaa
 It is true that foreign batsmen do not have the experience of playing on the turning track and r Ashwin, Amit Mishra and Ravindra Jadeja will also put a lot of pressure on them
 gend jab zyaada gumti he to usko control karnaa bhi zaruri he, newzealand ke gendbaajon ke liye ek badi chunauti ye bhi hogi kii wo is par kaise kaabo paaen, ye unke liye nayaa hoga,'pich ke hisaab se chune khiladivahin kapil kaa kahana he ki bharat ko pich ke hisaab se hi apni plaing ilevan chunani chahie
 He said, 'if the pitch is favorable then it can be hit with five bowlers
 main to asina kooleroundermanta hum or saaha agar aathven number par ballebaazi kar sakate hai to paanch gendbaaz khel sakate hai
 It would make sense to choose eleven only by guessing the pitch
 mujhe ye bhi lagata he ki newzealand ke captain ken williamsan kii wicket bharat ke liye bada mahatv rakhegi
 If they are not able to score, then the New Zealand team will automatically come under pressure

 The sayings and memories of childhood always remain with us
 aise main ye mata-pita kii jimmedaari ban jaati he ki wo apane bachche ko kam umr main hi un baton kii aadat daal den, jo uske aane vaale kal ke liye jaruri hai
 Parents, on their part, teach the child better than the best, but these are the 5 things that should be taught to every child: 1: The importance of time should be given to children by the importance of time
 unhen apane kaamon ko samay se karne ke liye prerit karnaa chahie
 Children should not only understand the value of their time, but should also learn to respect the time of others
 2
 Cleaning your things Often children keep their clothes, toys, books and other items scattered, but these habits need to be corrected in childhood
 mata-pita ko chahie ki wo bacchon ko apni chizon ko safai or sahejkar rakhana sikhaaen
 This habit will later prove to be helpful in the development of his personality
 3: dhairya rakhanaakai baar bachche khilone yaa phir kisi duusare saamaan ke liye jid karne lagate hai or maa-baap unhen shant karne ke liye unki maang puri kar dete hai
 They are wrong
 mata-pita ko chahie ki wo bachche ko kuch chizon ke liye manaa bhi karen
 This brings a sense of patience in children
 4
 The spirit of cooperation towards the people is very important to teach the child a sense of cooperation
 baccheepane bhai-bahan ke prati kaisaa ravaiya rakhte hai yaa phir apane doston ke saath unka vyavhaar kaisaa he, is baat par vishesh dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 His personality is attached to this behavior of his
 5
 Hard working habits would probably occur in many households that if the child gets more homework, the elders of the household help him
 haalanki ye puri tarah galat nahin he
 It is good that the child has some helpers, but it is not right that you give the child a rest and do his work
 bachche ko shuru se hi mehnat kii aadat dalwani chahie taaki, wo aage chalakar mehnat karne se kataraae nahin
 The rumor market is hot these days in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana
 iske chalate uttar pradesh ke paanch jilon ke logon main hadakamp machaa hua he
 Rumor is being spread on social media that five districts of Uttar Pradesh are going to meet in Haryana and Uttarakhand state
 whatrup ke jariye bheje ja rahe massej main kaha ja rahaa he ki jald hi modi sarkaar haryana or uttar pradesh sarkaar ke saath milakar bada faisla lene ja rahi he
 It is also being said in this rumor that two months before taking the decision, PM Modi has held a meeting with the Chief Ministers of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and some Principal Secretaries
 is dauraan sabhi binduon par vistaar se charchaa kii gai
 In the ongoing rumor on social media, it is being claimed that Saharanpur and Bijnor of Uttar Pradesh will be included in the state of Uttarakhand and Shamli, Muzaffarnagar and Meerut in the state of Haryana
 in afvaahon main yah tark diya ja rahaa he ki isse bhaajapa ek tir se kai nishane saadhane ja rahi he
 First of all, this decision will end the demand for partition of Uttar Pradesh and talk of green state
 iske alaava hoicourt ke aadesh par bhi viraam lag jayega
 Also, the existence of Uttar Pradesh's two regional parties SP and BSP will end
 sabhi jaanate he kiuttar pradeshke paanchon jile dalit or muslim bahulya he
 They play an important role in forming a government in Uttar Pradesh
 saharanpur or bijanor ke uttarakhand main jane se soobe main inkaa astitv kamjor pad jayega
 At the same time, their role in forming the government in Uttarakhand will be negligible and the BJP in Uttar Pradesh will be relieved of their stress
 iske alaava jat lambi ke naam par ajit singh hameshaa se sodebaaji karte aa rahe hai
 If Shamli, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar move to Haryana, then the politics of Ajit Singh's Jats from Uttar Pradesh will end
 haryana main ye log sarkaar banane yaa giraane kii sthiti main nahin honge
 The interesting thing is that not only at the center, but in all three states, BJP is the government
 afvaah main yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi sarkaar ko isse acha mauka ab kabhi nahin mil saktaa he
 Also, SP and BSP will become weak in the state due to five districts going out of Uttar Pradesh
 is par faisla liya ja chukaa he or 31 march tak yah sabake saamne aa jayega

 yah tab kii baat he, jab main bombai tokies main apni short film kii kahani likh rahaa tha
 Patel Babu, the original story of Satyajit Rai, neither had the character of his mentor nor any such scene in the film Star
 kahani main purandar puraani smritiyon main jaataa he
 How would one go to old memories without flashbacks to the cinema? Then i imagined that character: Purandar's guru, who suddenly comes from somewhere and talks to him
 mujhe aaj bhi yaad he vah din, jab main pehali barasadashiv amarapurkarase milane unke ghar gaya tha apni film kii script lekar
 His character was in my imagination
 lekin parade par vah kaisaa hoga, iskaa koi thos idia dimag main nahin tha
 By then, his movement in the film world had reduced
 lekin marathi theatre, kitabon, sahitya, kavitaaon se unka rishta bahut majboot tha
 The rest of the time was entrusted to social work
 maine unhen film kii kahani sunai
 This was evident from the emotion, brightness and sadness coming in his eyes, but now he also had a connection with this story
 ve haa yaa naa kehete, usase pehle hi maine unke saamne ek peshkash rakh di
 i said that i want to spend a whole day with you
 filmon or marathi theatre, sahitya ke bare main baat karte hue

 Nawaz and Sadashiv kept talking about his character

 Sadashiv himself wrote his character

 This is his last role on the cinema screen, which is now history
 ek bainnu kapoor kisi aword function main kaha tha ki main upar vaale se yahi dua karata hum ki jab agali baar mujhe duniya main bhejnaa to talented nahin, khubasurat banaakar bhejnaa
 And if God does not send the crisp to India, then send the skin color white
 aglaa janm to kisi ne nahin dekha, lekin sadashiv amarapurkar ke paas is janm main unamem se ek bhi cheez nahin thi
 In the glittering streets of Bollywood, a man who was black, short, was not beautiful in appearance and does not even belong to the film background
 aise main jaahir he, unke liye is duniya main apni jagah bananaa aasaan nahin tha
 He had reached here after going through all the bumpy paths
 un raaston ke nishaan unki ankhon main dikhaai dete the
 There are innumerable people in this Mayanagari whose journey has been full of ups and downs
 lekin ek baat thi, jo sirf amarapurkar main thi
 There was struggle in his eyes but there was no bitterness
 unki sthiti us sant kii tarah thi, jo ek oonchai par he or tatasth hokar niraasakt bhav se duniya ko dekh rahaa he
 Both the pleasures and the sorrows too
 vah har paristhiti main sambhaav he
 He has forgiven the world full of deception, maliciousness and misdeeds
 uske dil main koi shikaayat nahin
 The world is like this
 varanaa kya vajah thi ki kirdaar kii aatma main utarkar jhaank lene vaale marathi rangamanch ke is asaadhaaran kalakaar ko bollywood ek khalanaayak or balaatkaari se itar kisi or bhoomika main dekh hi nahin paaya
 How many people know that he was a deeply literary lover? What is the reason that a society does not give a talented person his right just because he does not live up to the prevailing standards of beauty? But in such a world, Sadashiv Amrapurkar knew his way
 bahut sara paisa, sukh-aaraam, samandar ke kinare badi-si khidki vaale bangale or jindagi kii tamaam ranginiyon kii chaah unhone bahut aasaani se chhod di or kabhi uskaa pachhtaawaa bhi nahin kiya
 They knew what they needed
 ve har samay hansate rahete or puraane kisse sunaate
 i still remember today, how he himself narrated an anecdote without bringing any expression to his face
 ek baar ve kisi film kii shooting kar rahe the, jisamen villen ghode par aata he
 He was the villain
 ghode ko achaanak jane kya hua ki vah daudte hue set se aage nikal gaya or bahut dur tak chalata gaya
 They rode a horse
 bahut dur jaakar jab ghoda rukaa to ve kisi tarah girte-padate set par waapas aae
 Villain's character changed from the next day
 ab vah ghode kii jagah jeep par aane laga
 His dialogue in the Bombay Talkiesfilm begins with the word "AE"
 ise bolne se pehle unhone hanskar kaha tha, ‘‘main apane rape seen kii yaad main ye shabd bol rahaa hum
 He used to loudly say "AE" before the rape scene in all the films
 yah kahana thodaa naatakeey hoga ki unke jane se bollywood kii gahari kshati hui he kyonki usne to unke rahete hi unki kala kii koi kadra nahin kii thi
 But the sad thing is that this world could not know that pure, deep, transparent artist Sadashiv in his true form
 vah insaan, jisane duniyavi sukhon kaa rasta chhod apane dil kii raah chuni thi
 Dibakar Banerjee is the film director (based on a conversation with Manisha Pandey) sonakshi sinha ko film industry main aae lagbhag ek dashak ho chukaa he
 His performance in some films was appreciated, while some films were badly beaten at the box office
 sonakshi sinha e dashak ke baad bhi film industry main apni jagah puri tarah se nahin bana pai hai
 The actress spoke about her film career during a recent interview
 IANS ko die gaye intervyuu ke dauraan sonakshi se poocha gaya ki kya unhen aaj bhi apni filmon kii relies ke vakt waisi hi nervasness hoti he jaisaa ki kariyar kii shuruyaat main hoti thim
 Responding to this, Sonakshi said that in a person's life, every film has a journey and a significance
 main bhi dusron kii tarah kisi film kii relies se pehle nervas ho jaati hum
 Sonakshi further said that at the beginning of her career, she had come to the idea that films should not pay much attention to being a hit and a flop
 kyonki film se judi har cheez par aapkaa niyantran nahin hota he
 You have to do your best and give 100%
 baaki aapako audiyans par chhod dena he
 Let me tell you that Sonakshi Sinha started her career with Dabangg movie in 2010
 ve salmaan khan ke saath acchhee bonding share karti hai
 Talking about her bonding with Salman Khan, Sonakshi Sinha said that her bonding with the actor is beyond professional relationship
 abhinay kii shuruyaat karne ke pehle se hi ve unhen jaanati hai
 Our family has also known each other for a long time
 main unhen ek costar se zyada ek dost ke rup main jaanati hum
 In Dabangg 3, Razsonakshi Sinha will play the role of Rajjo in Dabangg 3

 'the girl trapped mean laughing
 
 
 ' are nahin, kahin aap bhi to ladakiyon ke dil kii baat jaanane ke liye isi puraane formule par to nahin chal rahe hai? agar aisa he, to ise apane dimag se delit maariye, kaishe clear kariye or nae gyaan ko arjeet karne ke liye ready ho jaaiye
 So if you want to know what a girl thinks about you, then look out of her smile and check with these fresh techniques
 
 
 
 Although usually girls do not express their heart, but if they look at their body language, then it is not too difficult to find out whether the girl likes you or not
 naa ji naa, agar aisa he to ye mat samaj lijie ki ye aapke moschurising kriim kaa kamaal he
 This is because she is comfortable with you and expresses this by touching you
 to agar baatcheet yaa hansi thitholi ke dauraan wo aapaki peeth par haath pherati hai yaa aapkaa haath pakadati hai, to saaf he wo aapako pasand karti he
 (note: Although this can happen even if it is your friend
 isliye man main laddu phute, isse pehle baaki indicators par bhi gaur kar len)relationships tips: taaki pyaar ke bich kabhi na aaen dooriyaan
 
 
 If you are talking to them on a boring topic or are talking about something that is not listening to them, yet they are listening carefully, then it is clear that they do not want to hurt your heart
 tri karke dekhie, jis joke par doston ne aapke sens of humar kii khilli udayi, usee joke par agar wo ladki muskurabhar de to maan lijiye wo aapaki or aapke baton kii izzat rakhana chaahati hai
 While worrying, you do not forget 'what is there to worry about
 
 
 ' jaane kya he dementia or iske kaaranhalanki ye ishaare ye bhi sabit kar sakate hai ki ladki aapke saath rahanaa pasand karti he
 And it is not necessary that the girl who likes to spend time with you is also serious about you
 isliye agar aapako in tareekon ko applai kar aisa lagata he ki wo aapako pasand karti hai, to pehle puri tarah jaanch parakh len, tabhi aglaa kadam badhayen

 With starting a job, you do not think about saving, so retirement does not come in your imagination
 dhire-dhire jindagi kii adchanon se rubaru hokar aap seaving ke liye sajag hote jate hai or apni selary kaa kuch ansh seaving ke taur par bachaa lete hai
 Despite being alert for saving, it has been seen that many people delay in planning retirement
 aamtaur par aisa isliye hota he kyonki unhen pataa hi nahin hota ki ritairement planning kab, kyon or kaise kerani chahie
 When to do Retirement Planning For retired people, the retirement age is usually 60 years
 aap agar 25 se 30 saal kii umr main naukari pate hai to ritairement ke bare main sochna 35-40 saal kii umr se shuru kar dena chahie
 This stage of age is better because by this age you begin to understand about the expansion of your family and with this, your health is also good in such times
 kyon karen ritairement planningnaukari se ritair hone ke baad ek behatar jindagi ke liye yah bahut jaruri he ki aap kaaphi pehle se iske taiyaari shuru kar den
 This is because it is not necessary that social security and your pension can give you the life you expected
 jahaan naukari karte hue aap kai tarah ke adventure karte rahete hai or samay ke saath-saath kharch ko badhaate rahete hai kyonki aapke paas paisa kamaane ke liye naukari ke saath-saath incum badhaane ke tamaam saadhan maujuud rahete hai
 Apart from this, promotion in job also keeps increasing your earnings
 vahiin ritairement ke baad phicsad pension aapaki selary kii jagah le legi vahiin apane kharchon main kami karne kaa dabaav aap par lagaataar bana rahegaa
 How to Retirement Planning Take your salary as Rs 50,000 and the age is 40 years
 aise main aapke paas abhi 20 saal kaa vakt he
 So, first of all you should keep a complete statement of your current expenses and savings in order to make a retirement plan
 iske saath hi aapako yah aankalan hona chahie ki naukari ke alge 20 saalon main aapakon kitne paison kii jarurat padane vaali he
 First of all, add your monthly expenses
 First of all, see how much your monthly expenses are
 is kharch main khaane-pine kaa kharch, anya bill, mentanence or ghar se jude madon ko shaamil kar len
 Suppose you spend 20 thousand rupees monthly on this item
 chhuttiyon par hone vaala kharchasaal main aap parivaar ke saath kai baar ghoomane kaa program banaate hai
 Suppose you spend 20 thousand rupees a year on this item
 transportesan or antertenment par kharchatransportesan par aap pratidin kharch karte hai
 Also, you spend a huge amount on entertainment for yourself and family
 maan len ki ek saal main in donon madon par aap 30 hajaar rupye kharch karte hai
 Medical expenses and emergency expenses both of these items are unplanned
 lekin phir bhi in kharchon ko kahin na kahin aapako vahan karnaa padataa he
 Suppose your fat expenditure on these items is 30 thousand rupees
 tex bhugtan par kharchaap prativarsh tex ke rup main kitne rupye kaa bhugtan karte hai
 Suppose, according to income, you pay 20 thousand rupees per year in different types of tax payments
 mahangaai dar kaa aankalanavastuon kii keemton main lagaataar ijapha hota rahata he
 Until a few days ago, things which used to cost less than Rs 100, have now reached around 120
 lihaaja, jab tak aapkaa ritairement najadik aayega kai jaruri vastuon par kharch bad jayega
 So let us assume annually that you will spend 50 thousand rupees more on inflation
 ab uparokt sabhi kharchon ko jodne parmasik kharch- 20,000 x 12 = 2,40,000chhuttiyon par kharch = 20,000transportesan kharch = 30,000immergency kharch = 30,000tex bhugtan kharch = 20,000mahangaai dar kharch = 50,000kul kharch = 3,90,000lihaaja, ritairement ke baad aapako kul 3 lakh 90 hajaar rupye vaarshik kharch ke liye jaruri honge
 According to this, if you assume the age of about 20 years after retirement, then during this period you will need a total of 78 lakh rupees
 haalanki aapke ritairement ke baad bhi mahangaai dar main lagaataar ijapha hota rahegaa isliye is kharch main lagbhag 10 lakh rupee mahangaai dar kaa or jodne par aapako retarment ke baadaj bees saal tak lagbhag 90 lakh rupye kii jarurat padegi

 The Indian auto sector is currently going through a variety of problems
 auto companiyon ne hajaaron logon kii chuttee kar di he, vahiin kai hajaar karmchaariyon par talwaar lataki he
 The special thing is that the decline in the business of the Indian auto industry has had an impact on the business of the companies that supply them
 bhartiya auto udyog main teji se ai giravat ke kaaran gadiyon ke parts supplai karne vaali 400 companiyon ko is vittiya varsh main 10 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 The fall in the auto industry in 2019 has also had an impact on the income of AIFI (association of India Forging Industry)
 bataa den ki pichley varsh AIFI kii vaarshik rajasav aay lagbhag 50 hajaar karod rupee thi
 Two senior members of the Forging Industry Association of India told Aaj Tak that the fall in the auto industry had an impact on the 400-member industrial units which fall under AIFI
 isse prabhavit hone vaali companiyon main 180 se 200 vinirmaan ikaiyaan hai
 83% are small scale industrial units
 9% madhyam ikaiyaan hai or baaki bade paimaane par audyogic nirmaataa hai
 Small industry has suffered the most due to the decline in the auto sector
 varsh 2018-19 ke utpaadan se forging udyog ko lagbhag 50 hajaar karod rupee kaa rajasav praapt hua tha, lekin is vitt varsh main forging industry ko 9 se 10 hajaar karod rupye tak kaa nuksaan hone kaa anumaan he
 The decline in vehicle sales will mainly affect smaller scale units
 tulanaatmak rup se dekhen to madhyam or bade paimaane ke forging udyogon ke mukaable chote paimaane kii ikaayiyon ko zyada bada khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 Adverse effects occur when the inventory gets stuck, funds are held or liquidity is very pathetic
 auto sector BS-4 se BS-6 main hone vaale parivartan ke kaaran sankat main he
 Car sales have fallen sharply in wait for BS-6
 pareshaani ye he ki auto sector main giravat ke kaaran chote udyogon ke maal kii khapat nahin ho paa rahi he
 In case of non-consumption of auto parts, the small companies making them will have to suffer big losses
 kaccha maal bachegaa to unhen banane vaali companiyaan auto parts kii keemton ko kam karne par majaboor ho jaaengi
 As a result, a large number of people working in small scale industries may have to lose their jobs

 Along with the RJD, the Congress is also an attacker on the changed political situation in Bihar and the friendship of nitish-modi
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne guuruuvaar ko nitish kumaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Accusing Nitish Kumar of cheating, Rahul said- i knew from 3 months that political khichdi is cooking
 par yahaan ab sawaal ye uthta he ki agar congress yaa rahul gandhi ko ye pataa tha ki ye uthapatak hone vaali he to bihar main mahagathbandhan bachaane ke liye kuch kiya kyon nahin gaya?kahaan chook gaye rahul?aise vakt main jab rahul gandhi active tareeke se congress kii aguai karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Preparations for his coronation as party president are also underway in October
 aise main bihar main satta mahagathbandhan kii bajaay endie ke kheme main chalaa janaa vipaksh ke liye ek bada jhatka he
 That too at a time when the Opposition was conducting a National Grand Alliance to challenge Modi in 2019
 bihar jaise bade rajya main congress satta kii saajhedaar thi
 There was talk of making Bihar a model for 2019
 pichley hafte nitish kumaar rahul gandhi se dilli main aakar mili auki tab bhi mahagathbandhan batch nahin sakaa
 This will begin to raise questions on the politics of Rahul Gandhi
 ishaaron ko nahin pakad paae rahul gandhi?raashtrapati or uparashtrapati chunaav main bhi congress ne ummidavaar utaara lekin bihar main tab congress ke sahyogi rahe nitish kumaar ne raashtrapati chunaav main endie ummidavaar ko samarthan de diya
 For this, did Congress strategist and Rahul Gandhi take any initiative to save the Grand Alliance
 jis rashtriya mahagathbandhan ke formule ke saath 2019 main modi ko chunauti dene kii vipaksh kii yojana thi uskaa model hi bihar main fail ho gaya
 Now the Congress and all the opposition parties will have to come forward with the new policy again
 vidhansabha ke ahm chunaavon se pehle jhatkisi saal gujarat or himachal pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Prior to this, getting away from the power of a big state like Bihar is a big setback for the Congress
 goa or manipur main congress sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi lekin vahaan bhi bijepi sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 When Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and the Congress came together with the idea of a grand alliance when recently the BJP lost in the UP elections
 bihar main ekta banaae rakhkar vipakshi dalaane vaale chunaavon main bijepi kevijay kaa rath roak sakate thelekin bihar daanv modi-shah kii ranneeti kii badi safalataa he or vipaksh ke liye mukaable main lautnaa or mushkil hoga
 Especially for Rahul Gandhi's efforts to be the face of the opposition, it will also be considered a big blow

 Local people say that due to the dumping ground, their lives will become difficult
