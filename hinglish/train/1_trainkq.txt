 ) When Steve Jobs first launched the iphone, he said, you will no longer need to wear a watch
 kyonki yphone main ghadi he
 Jobs Sahib went to heaven
 abhi unke uttaradhikari tim cook ne yphone 6 se pardaa uthaate hue kaha ki hamako bas ek adad ghadi kii jarurat he
 That watch belongs to Apple
 technology mahaj upyog kii nahin, pahanane kii cheez ho gai he
 And this is not new
 samsung, alji or bhatere chini nakalchiyon ne nai ghadiyaan bazaar main do saal pehle se utaarani shuru kar di thim
 These clocks act like mobile phones
 aapako aapaki hrydaygati or raktchaap bhi bataati hai
 But the world had not yet grown
 kuch logon ne kharida bhi to bahut zyada prabhavit nahin dikhe
 But now that Apple has made Apple Watch, then there is a new fever on the people
 achaanak ek nai jarurat paidaa ho gai he
 It seems life was incomplete without this watch
 ye ghadi vah sab karti he jo yphone karata he
 But if you are thinking that you will take this watch without taking iphone then you are wrong
 ye ghadi tabhi kaam karti he jab aapke paas yphone ho
 Since time is the biggest money, you will have to pay a lot of money to see time in this hour
 nayaa yphone batue kaa kaam bhi karata he
 Provided you give away your wallet
 yaa gurda
 i am talking about the kidneys because after the news of every new iphone, there are reports that a man in such and such city of such and such country sold his kidneys to buy an iphone
 ye khabaren padhakar ham hameshaa sochate the ki duniya kitni baurai he
 Has come down on a kidney deal for a phone
 par gaur se sochaa to laga ki phaayde kaa sauda he
 Android phones may be twenty on the iphone, but their position will remain nineteen
 baat simple he
 iphone status is symbol
 bhagwaan ne hamen do gurde die, jabaki kaam to ek se hi chal jaataa he
 If God had to stop us from selling kidneys, he would have given one
 allaah kii marji ke bich main banda kyon aae
 Here are 6 reasons for selling a kidney for the iphone 6: 1
 gurde dikhne main thode wo hote hai
 Soaked and lurlure
 agar haath main le lo to ultiyaan aa jaaen
 iphone on the other hand! Masha Allah! Ringtone for metal body, slim body and maddam-muddham smooth music
 2
 Who knows if he has two kidneys or one
 apane paas agar yphone ho to sab jaan jate hai
 Even in the pocket, the face shows confidence
 agar nahin pakad main aae to chintaa nahin kyonki yphone kaa swami har minute main ek baar ise jeb se nikaal niharta he
 3
 kidney kaa kaam he khun saaf karnaa
 Just one thing
 yphone se aap gaanaa sun sakate hai, photo khinch sakate hai, candi krash khel sakate hai
 That is, multi-tasking can be done
 nae yphone se aap kharidari ke dauraan bhugtan bhi kar sakate hai
 Although the kidneys also pay, most establishments accept credit cards
 4
 You have two kidneys, as everyone has
 ek nikaal do to bhi aapke paas phulli functional kidney rahati he or ek yphone bhi aa jaataa he
 5
 kidney kii takanic sadiyon puraani he
 Since God created it, there has not been any upgrade
 yphone bhi aadhunik takanic or dizin ke bhagwaan shri steve jobs ne banaaya
 There is also a software upgrade every year
 bhale hi nexs se ek-do saal peeche chal rahaa ho, par kidney se to behatar hi he
 6
 kya aapako pataa he ki aapaki kidney or aishwarya raay kii kidney kii shakl hoobahoo milti he? yakeen nahin hoga par ye sach he
 But do you see people with the same love that people once saw Aishwarya? No
 vah aapako hameshaa se usee udaseenta se dekhte hai, jisase log aajkal aishwarya ko dekha karte hai
 Why? Because your beautiful kidney is not visible
 jo dikhataa he, vahi tikta he
 The iphone bridges the gap between a common girl and Deepika Padukone
 jo phone uske paas, vahi phone aapke paas
 Maybe your cover is even prettier

 The UPA government has always been strengthened by his leadership and guidance
 hamen apni safaltaaon ke liye jitna shrey milanaa chahie, utana nahin mil paaya

 ab is mantra ko apnaanaa he to sada khaane main khichdi se behatar or kya ho saktaa he
 Khichdi, which has an important place in Indian cuisine in vegetarian cuisine, is dominated on social media these days
 khichdi ko bharat ke superfood ke taur par pesh kiye jane ko lekar charchaa bhi khub ho rahi he
 Is khichdi really so rich that it can go to super food? If you believe that Acharya Balakrishna of Patanjali Yogpeeth, Haridwar, then the qualities in the khichdi are filled with cod
 acharya ke mutabik yah khushi kii baat he ki der se hi sahi lekin khichdi ko uskaa sammaan milane ja rahaa he
 Acharya says that khichdi truly represents India because it shows 'unity in diversity' like our country
 khichdi kisi na kisi rup main bharat ke har rajya main khai jaati he, lekin har jagah uskaa swaad uskaa rang rup or usko banane kaa tarika alag alag hota he
 The biggest feature of Khichdi is that it can be changed according to your choice
 khichdi banane ke tareeke main tamaam badlaav karne ke baad bhi iske buniyadi gun or swaad donon bane rahete he
 According to Acharya Bal Krishna, according to Ayurveda, khichdi is considered a very good diet
 yah pachaane main aasaan hoti he
 If health is not good, it is recommended to eat khichdi as a light meal
 shishu bhi jab ann khaanaa shuru karte hai to khichdi hi unke munh lagaai jaati he
 Rice, peeled dal, very mild spices and vegetables are used to cook khichdi
 ise pakaana bhi bahut aasaan he
 Due to this ease of making, 'khichdi baking' is also used as an idiom
 acharya kehete hai ki khichdi ko jo pahchaan or sammaan ab mil rahaa he, wo bahut pehle hi mil janaa chahie tha
 Let us get late, better fit
 depressant se pareshaan log usase mukti paane ke liye kya kuch nahin karte hai
 Some people take different types of medicines, then some people change their entire diet
 lekin jab aaraam nahin miltaa to log pehle se zyada takalif main aa jate hai or is tarah log depressant ke daldal main funsate chale jate hai
 But according to a new study, eating depression can not cure your depression
 jarnal of american medical association main prakashit report ke mutabik, nutrishanal supplement aapke depressant ko thik karne main kargar nahin he
 Let me tell you, this study included people from UK, Netherlands, Germany and Spain who are not in depression but are on the verge of having depression
 is study ke liye 1000 logon kaa sample liya gaya he
 In this study, which lasted for one year, some people were given nutritional supplements
 jabaki kuch ko placebo or kuch logon ko lifestil koching di gai
 Although the results of the study are not very positive on any aspect, it has been said that changes in diet and behavioral therapy are capable of reducing depression to some extent
 is study ke shodhakarta professor idi watkin kehete hai, 'depressant ek bahut hi saamaanya samasya ban gai he, jo kaaphi logon ko apni chapet main le rahi he, iskaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa jaruri he
 After this study, we can say that taking a nutritional supplement does not reduce depression
 lekin diet main parivartan karne se depressant main kuch had tak kam ho saktaa he
 More study is still needed to fully confirm this
 'is study ke baad kaha ja saktaa he ki agar aap apni diet main fal, subjiyan, machhlee, daal or dairy product shaamil karenge to aap swasth rahenge or depressant kaa khatra bhi kam rahegaa
 At the same time if you are obese then start losing your weight, this will also reduce your depression

 It is worth noting that when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar arrived to participate in the program organized at Gandhi Maidan in Patna during Dussehra, he was very surprised to see BJP minister or Governor or MLA not seeing anyone there
 unhone aayojakon se is sambandh main poocha bhi to unhen bataaya gaya ki sabane sahmati dekar antim samay main koi na koi bahaanaa kar is kaarykram se kinaaraa kar liya tha jiske upar jiske baad gathbandhan ke bhavishya ko lekar kaafii sawaal uth khadey hue the
 But later BJP National President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah put a stop to all speculation by saying that the BJP will contest the Bihar Assembly elections next year under Nitish Kumar's leadership
 kuch rishte aise hote hai jo shuru to ho jate hai lekin anjaam tak nahin pahunch pate
 At the same time, there are some who are not able to start even
 kai baar aisa hota he ki donon paksh samaan rup se ek-duusare ke prati bhavanaaen rakhte hai lekin phir bhi baat nahin ban paati he
 But do you know why some relationships do not progress further? Although there can be many reasons for this to happen, but if you are stuck in such a situation yourself, then you need to think what could be the reason for this happening in your relationship
 yahaan aisi kuch vajahon kaa zikr he jisaki vajah se rishte puure nahin ho pate hai:1
 The girl never responds that the girl you like, be it your neighbor or college-mate
 aap roj use dur se dekhte hai aushapana interest dikhaane kii bharpoor koshish karte hai
 The girl is also happy on your words and deeds but does not respond on her own
 aise main prem kahani kabhi bhi aage nahin bad paati
 You also do not have the courage to propose her from the front and the girl herself never takes the initiative
 aise rishte aage badhane se pehle hi khatm ho jate hai
 2
 asthirataa kii sthiti menkai mahilaayein aisi hoti hai jo jaldi faisle nahin le paatin or dhulmul ravaiya rakhti hai
 Such women are unstable
 approach kiye jane par ve baat karti he, muskuraati hai or apana interest bhi dikhaati hai lekin tab bhi kuch baat nahin ban paati he
 Such girls take a lot of time to decide and are unstable 3
 dar bhi hoti he ek vajahwo aapse bahut pyaar karti he lekin kabhi bhi itani himmat nahin juta paati he ki apane ghar main aapke sandarbh main baat kar paae
 You try to convince her in every way, but despite your millions of efforts, she gives you some excuse
 aisi kahaniyaan shuru to heti hai lekin kuch hi dinon main khatm bhi ho jaati hai
 4
 ahankaar bhi he karankai baar ahankaar kii vajah se bhi kuch rishte aage nahin bad pate hai
 You both love each other but keep waiting that the person should propose before the front
 aise main donon hi apane-apane ahankaar main dabe rah jate hai or prem kahani kaa di and ho jaataa he
 The things that have been said here in the context of girls can also be in the context of boys
 kai baar kuch ladke apane jivan main pratikriya shunya, asthir or darpok hote hai
 In such a situation, despite the efforts of one side, their love story ends with the beginning
 desh, duniya, mahanagar khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 Nepal police have arrested a henchman of Dawood Ibrahim on the input of Indian intelligence agencies
 is shaks kaa naam unuus ansaari he, police ne iske paas saadhe saat karod ke nakli bhartiya note baraamad kiye hai
 Along with Yunus, police have also arrested 3 people of Pakistani origin
 inaki giraftaar shuukravaar ko kii gai
 Aaj Tak was informed by the Nepal Police official that in fact Yunus living in Nepal is considered to be a special henchman of Dawood Ibrahim
 ye shaks daaud or ISI ke ishaare par nepal se bharat main nakli noton ke kaale kaarobaar ko chalaata he
 Yunus Ansari is the son of former Nepalese minister Salim Ansari, both closely related to the d-company of father-sons and both have always been on the radar of the Indian agency
 indian agency ne nepal police ko alert kiya tha ki kuch pakistani airport par aa rahe hai jinase milane unuus jane vaala he
 Nepal Police put a trap at Kathmandu Airport and 3 Pakistani nationals Mohammed Nasiruddin, Mohammad Athar and woman Nadia Amber were arrested with fake Indian notes while reaching Doha from Pakistan
 inke saath do nepali bhi giraftaar kiye gaye hai
 According to Nepal Police, Yunus had gone to Ansari Airport to receive all these along with fake Indian notes worth seven and a half crores
 report ke mutabik nakli note teen suutakes main bharkar rakhe gaye the
 The notes were so large that the police had to call for a machine to be counted
 philhal in sabhi se poochtacha chal rahi he unuus ansaari kaaphi saal jail main rahane ke baad chuta tha or sidhaa pakistan jaakar daaud and company se sampark saadhaa
 Police say that this consignment of fake 2000 notes was to be transported to India via Nepal border
 bharat or america 6 sitambar ko apane sabase ahm dotarafa shikhar sammelan kii shuruyaat karne ja rahe hai jab america videsh mantri mike pokvipayo or raksha mantri gym mattis apane bhartiya samakakshon videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ke saath apane pehle "tu plus tu samvaad (2+2 dialog)'' kii neenv rakhenge
 The 2 + 2 Dialogue is meant to build a high level of trust between the two countries and conceals the hope and possibility of being the first episode of an annual series of dialogues to be held in both countries in turn
 america ke saath bharat kii yah jugalbandi aitihaasik bharat-america asainya parmaanu samjhaute kii 10veen saalagirah par ho rahi he
 However, the smiling faces on this occasion hardly cover the reality that india-us relationship is one of its worst in the last decade since the signing of the nuclear deal between the two countries in 2006 and becoming a strategic partner
 Are going through america raashtrapati donald trump kii disambar 2017 kii rashtriya suraksha ranneeti ne hindustan ko "america kaa bada raksha bhagidaar'' kaha tha or uske saath "apana raksha or suraksha sahyog badhaane'' kaa vaada kiya tha
 Also to not take action against Islamic terrorists 1
 8 arab dollar kii aarthik sahaayta rokkar pakistan par nakel daalane kaa vaada bhi kiya gaya tha
 However, the recent steps of the President have disappointed India
 purv bhartiya videsh sachiv kanwal sibbal kehete hai, "2+2 samvaad us vakt ho rahaa he jab raashtrapati trump kii nitiyon ne antarrashtriya maamalon main anischitata paidaa kar di he, america ke sahyogi or virdohi, donon deshon ke suvidhajanak kshetra main or saath hi bharat sareekhe bhagidaaron ke purvanumaanon main halchal machaa di he
 "all these consents are going to be unveiled in the shadow of a fierce law called CAATSA (the law to counter America's opponents through sanctions)
" sieetise is saal april main lagu hua tha
 It imposes sanctions on Russia and Iran — both of which are India's strategic partners
 ek, uskaa sabase bada hathiyaar saplir he or doosraa, uskaa teesraa sabase bada urja saplir
 The CAATSA empowers the US to impose "second-rate sanctions" on countries that do well with Russia
 pichley maheene yues congress ne neshnal dephence othrigeshan act (endiee) kaa badla hua sanskaran paarit kiya, jo america raashtrapati ko bharat ko pratibandhon se chhot dene kaa adhikaar detaa he
 This will enable India to sign a $ 5 billion deal to buy five S-400 long-range air defense missiles from Russia
 yah badla hue kanoon nahin hota to bharat ke khilaaf america pratibandh laga die jate
 But this relief is only temporary relief
 yah koi khuli chhot nahin, sashart chhot he, jisamen america ko yah pramanit karnaa hoga ki bharat, rus ke hathiyaaron par nirbharta se apane ko alag karne ke liye paryaapt kadam uthaa rahaa he
 This gives America enormous scope which it can use to get concessions from India
 phir bharat ke iran se 10 arab dollar ke tel kaa aayaat karne kaa mudda he
 Iran is the country to which the US has imposed sanctions
 america chahta he ki november tak iran se tel kaa aayaat puri tarah band kar diya jaae
 Diplomats have compared this to bullying and the use of force
 jab america ne pichhali baar 2012 main pratibandh lagaae the, tab bharat ne uski baat maani thi or iran se apane tel aayaat main jabardastee katautee kii thi
 This time he cannot do so as he has developed a strategic Chabahar port in Iran which bypasses Pakistan and gives India a way to reach Afghanistan and Central Asia and also has built an international north-south traffic corridor
 , Which drastically reduces the time when cargo ships reach Europe
 vivaad kaa ek or mudda he jiske 2+2 samvaad main ubharkar aane kii sambhaavna he
 That is to make the US H-1B work visas a rule
 ab yah unhen banisbatan kam vannt ke liye diya ja rahaa he, jisase karmchaariyon ke liye green card kii arji dena mushkil ho gaya he
 In July, the National Foundation for American Policy, a us-based non-profit organization, said that the number of people denying H-1B visas for Indians increased 42 percent
 bharat ne desh se ispaat or aluminium ke america aayaat par shulk lagane ko sthagit kiya he
 In the expectation of a 2 + 2 dialogue, India has postponed the imposition of tariffs in return and thus maintains a scope for negotiation
 acchhee baaten bhi hai
 The ministerial level 2 $ 2 dialogue, which was postponed twice this year, is expected to negotiate defense deals for missiles, drones and helicopters worth more than $ 5 billion
 america ke saath do ahm samjhauton kii shuruyaat bhi sambhavit he—inamen se ek sioimasese yaa communications compatibility and security agreement he jinase bharat ke america nirmit sainya plateform vishesh sanchaar divison kii sthapana ke baad america or nato plateformon ke saath sanchaar kar paaenge; doosraa biesie yaa buniyadi aadan-pradaan or sahyog samjhauta he, jo aisi soochnaaon kii adla-badali kii ijaajat degaa

 The US is India's second largest supplier of defense hardware and has supplied Chinook Medium Liquid choppers, Apache helicopter gunships, P-8I Poseidon long-range maritime surveillance aircraft, C-130 medium transport aircraft and C-17 heavy lift aircraft

 On 1 August, the Trump administration placed India on the list of Strategic Trade Authorizations-1 (STA-1), which meant that India could buy expensive and high technology from the US

 Since they are controlled by satellite, these drones do not necessarily have to be within the line of sight of the ship or the control rooms on the coast

 But the question is, who is responsible for this trouble that comes every year? How much pollution increases in Delhi due to burning of straw? Soumi Roychowdhury, Associate Fellow of NCAR, a Delhi-based think tank, believes that there has been no freezing and since April 2018 a higher category fuel policy has been in force
 in sabake baavjood pradooshan badhane kii ek hi vajah ho sakati he or wo he fasal kii kataai ke baad lagaai gai aag
 “stubble burning in the neighboring states of Delhi is a major cause of pollution

 This is a cheaper way to clean the field
 kisaan kehete hai ki ek acre kii paraali hataane ke liye aath hajaar rupye lagate hai or kheti kii baaki kharch ko dekhte hue yah unke boote kii baat nahin he
 This method of cleaning the farm is making the air in Delhi and surrounding areas more toxic

 Along with the other reasons responsible for causing pollution, burning of stubble causes the air to deteriorate and respiratory diseases increase three times
 ”hawa main maujuud chote kan fefdon or khun main mil jate hai jiske baad kaph, heart atake or fefde kii bimaaria bad jaati hai
 Some experts tried to find the answer to the question that how much pollution is increased by burning stubble

 The problem of burning stubble has been around for a long time, but every political party this season, instead of removing the farmers' problem, proves to be friendly
 is bare main dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki “iske liye kisaanon ko jimmedaar nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki unhen agali fasal ke liye khet taiyaar karnaa he

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi has called the two leaders to Delhi for a meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday after the ongoing dispute between the Chief Minister Kamal Nath and supporters of Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh about the ongoing new party president in the state
 haalanki, kisi anchaahi sthiti ko rokane ke liye sonia ne donon netaaon ko alag-alag bulaayaa he
 While Scindia has been called on Tuesday, Kamal Nath will meet Sonia the next day, Sonia Gandhi wants a state president of the party in Madhya Pradesh who has the support of both Kamal Nath and Scindia, which seems unlikely at the moment

 Dangi said that, "some leaders of the Congress state unit are not able to digest Scindia's popularity and are conspiring to keep him out of Madhya Pradesh
" " kai log maanate hai ki yah sab sindhiya kii sahmati se hua
 Scindia herself is in the race
 haalanki unhone yah khud nahin kaha he lekin unke samarthakon ne isaki maang karne vaale poster lagava die hai
 However, another center in the state's politics is against the appointment of Digvijay Singh Scindia as Congress state president, which is making the work of Kamal Nath easy
 sutron ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ek adivasee pradesh adhyaksh bananaa chaahate hai, jisase sindhiya ke pradesh adhyaksh banane ke asaar apane aap khatm ho jate hai
 Kamal Nath is not meeting him for the first time after Sonia became the party's interim chief

 Whether it is a dispute over whether Mumbai is 'only for the Marathas' or the issue of giving employment to the Marathas in the state, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray is always seen speaking in the 'interest' of the community, but the community believes that Thackeray With this 'terrorism' of their own, they are doing nothing more than to bring slander and danger to the Marathas across the country

 un 'gyani' purushon se bachie jo ladakiyon ke bare main kuch sthaayee dharanaen paal lete hai or phir un shagufon ke prachaar main jute jate hai
 What girls think, what they want, how they laugh, what they eat and drink, the contract is the responsibility of all these people
 ladakiyon ke bare main ladke or khud ladkiyaan bhi ye 'steriotip' jehan main baitha lete hai or use pathar kii lakeer samajhane lagate hai
 Baba Tintin, a lover of lovers, believes that this baggage needs to be left behind in the new era
 ladakiyon ke bare main ladakon ko hai ye 16 galatchhemiyaan1
 She speaks a lot: if you think that every girl is going to speak then it only means that you have not been raised by girls who keep quiet or speak in a balanced amount
 aisi ladkiyaan bhi hai jo jaanati hai ki unhen kab, kahaan or kitna bolnaa he
 2
 shringaar kaa riple:apni chand si surat baar-baar dekhne par bhi ladakiyon ko chidhaayaa jaataa he
 But there are many girls too, who without their make-up smile, have the ability to give coolness like rain even in hard sunlight
 3
 Come Sister Chugli: Hanging from the balcony of the houses or in the middle class, girls are often seen discussing social issues, which the world has named Chugli
 aise main hamen un ladakiyon kii bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie jo man main apane dukh samete rahati hai
 4
 raajnneeti main haath tite:aalia bhatta ke raashtrapati kaa naam na bataa paane kii apaar safalataa ke baad or pehle bhi ladakiyon kaa raajnneeti se judi baton main haath tite samajha jaataa he
 But at such a time, we forget the understanding of Malala Yousafzai and the speech given by Yugratna Srivastava of Lucknow School in the United Nations on Green Climate
 5
 Shopping, shopping, shopping: Shopping is understood to be the biggest need for girls with boyfriends to reduce tension
 ladakiyon ke haathon main rashan ke jhole kii tarah latakate hue shopping bags ko unki pahchaan se jod liya jaataa he
 But keeping a hand on the heart, the boys will also have to remember that some girl must have bought the sweetest shirt and jeans for them
 6
 lup-loop in Driving: People who take inspiration from Dhoom films do not consider girls to be better at driving
 par aise main ham sunita williams or kalpana chawla kii antariksh kii yatra ko bhuulaa dete hai
 7
 sanvarne main vakt:puraa chand bhi 30 din baad dikhataa he
 But the minor three-four hours it takes for the girls to be groomed, the bloodthirsty world adds more time to decorate
 par unhi ladakiyon kii khubsuurati kii vajah se doston main apni jamaai dhak ko koi jodakar nahin dekhtaa
 8
 ladki kaa cook hona jaruri:mard ke dil kaa rasta pet se hokar gujarata he or dil tak pahunchane kaa kaam ladki ko karnaa he to use khaanaa bananaa jaruri he
 If the girl does not know how to cook, it is counted among her childhood mistakes
 par ladke ye nahin sochate ki kya megi ke alaava unako bhi kuch bananaa aata he
 9
 pink matlab ladki:gulabi gaalon ko gulabi poshaak se jodakar dekhne waalon kaa maananaa he ki ladakiyon kaa pasandida rang gulabi hota he
 Hindi films and Archies Gallery contribute significantly to this
 par gulabi rang ke pher main aap apni priytama ko kaale rang kii khubasurat dress main dekhakar bhi laar tapakaa dete hai
 10
 roti bahut ho:sundarataa or bhavukta kaa sambandh hota he
 Perhaps this is why it is said about most girls that girls cry a lot
 or vahi rone vaali ladki agar relationships todane kii baat kah de, to ladke khud bhi nirupa roy kii tarah aansu bahaane lagate hai
 11
 prapoj karne main garib:pyaar kaa izhaar karne kaa daayitv ladakon ke jimme hi hota he
 The most commonly said slang of girls is how girls can propose
 koi is par bhi dhyaan do bhai ki tumhaare ek baar prapoj karne ke baad rishte ko lambey vakt tak chalaane or balak jaise hath ko jhelane kaa kaam bhi to ladkiyaan hi karti hai
 12
 golgappas, chater-patar:jindagi kaa majaa khattey main he or is tarah se jindagi kaa khattapen ke saath majaa lete hue sabase zyada ladkiyaan dekhi jaati hai
 These believers forget that taste of their own tongue, when they enter the wedding pandals, they pick up the Golgappa, the goose leaf
 13
 i Love This Taddy, Chocolate: Every girl likes to have a taddy like a mother-in-law, mother-in-law, by sticking around her neck
 ab to jaahil se jaahil ladkaa ye kehane laga he ki kisi ladki ko khush karne kaa rasta tadi or chocolate he
 But they themselves forget the centerfresh they ate after smoking cigarettes
 14
 Today Cash Tomorrow Borrow: Girls avoid paying bills in hotels, restaurants
 jisaki vajah se sara bhaar nar paksh par aa jaataa he, agar aap bhi aisa sochate hai, to apane ghar kii taraf rukh kiijie, jab aap apni bahan yaa sabase acchhee dost se paise maangate hai
 Girls save money and only give them to you
 15
 Love is not money: i do not want love for money
 ladakiyon ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki sabhi ladakiyon ko paise vaale ladke se hi shaadi kerani he
 In such a situation, my only question to the boys below BPL is whether you also do not want a job in a good package
 16
 Nonwave Jokes: Girls do not like nonwave jokes and many boys start thinking of nonwave jokes as their property and believe that girls are very fragile
 lekin jaan len ki non jokes par sirf ladakon kaa hi haq nahin he, kuch ladkiyaan bhi non veg jokes pasand karti hai

 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan baad bhi rajya main bijepi or shivasena ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar ek raay nahin ban paa rahi he
 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has given a big statement amid the ongoing tussle over seat sharing
 unhone news agency ANI se kaha ki itnaa bada maharashtra (maharashtra Assembly Election) he, ye jo 288 siton kaa bantwaaraa he ye bharat-pakistan ke bantwaare se bhi bhayankar he
 He said that if we had been in opposition already, the situation would have been different today
 hamaare bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar jo bhi tay hoga usase aapako avgat karaayenge
 Explain that the statement of Shiv Sena leader and minister in Maharashtra government, Diwakar Raut, was supported by the party's strong leader Sanjay Raut
 unhone kaha tha ki agar amit shah ji or siem ke saamne 50-50 seat bantwaare kaa formula tay kiya gaya tha, to unka bayaan galat nahin he
 Why will we fight elections together? darasal mantri divakar route ne ek media se baatcheet main kaha tha ki agar bijepi shivasena ko aadhi siten nahin detii he to gathbandhan tut saktaa he
 At the same time, talks between the top leadership of the two parties are likely to be held soon to resolve the screws over the seat-sharing between the BJP and Shiv Sena in the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 udhar, endie ke ek or sahyogi arpiai (e) ne 10 siton kii maang kar is mudde par mushkilen badha di hai
 The Shiv Sena wants to contest the upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra on as many seats as the BJP will field its candidates
 vahiin, bijepi shivasena ko baraabar sankhya main seat nahin dena chaahati he
 a BJP leader had argued that the party's vote percentage increased in the 2019 general election compared to the 2014 election
 saath hi jammu kashmir ko vishesh darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 samaapt kiye jane se pradhanmantri narendra modi kii lokapriyata badhane se (party ko) laabh milegaa
 However, party sources had said that after talks between the top leaders of both parties about the seats, the path would be cleared soon
 maharashtra main sattarudh endie ke ghatak arpiai (e) ke adhyaksh ramdaas athavle ne sahyogi shivasena ko 120 se 125 siton kaa formule sweekaar karne kaa suzav diya
 He had emphasized that the coalition should not be gifted in some seats like in the previous assembly elections
 athavle ne kaha tha ki maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav main arpiai ko kam se kam 10 siten milani chahie or sheeghra hi siton kaa bantwaaraa bhi ho janaa chahie
 i have made this request in the talks with the BJP high level leadership
 ' unhone daawa kiya tha ki yadi sheeghra siton kaa bantwaaraa ho jayega to bhaajapa
 
 shivasena
 
 arpiai sahit anya gathbandhan ko 240 siten par vijay milanaa nishchit he
 Significantly, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, the major coalition of the opposition in the state, have finalized the seat tally
 rakanpa ke pramukh sharad pavaar ne kuch hi din pehle kaha tha ki congress or rakanpa pradesh main 125-125 siton par chunaav ladegi or 38 siten choti sahyogi dalon ke liye chodi jaayengi
 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in the presence of BJP President Amit Shah and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, the two parties had agreed to contest assembly elections on equal number of seats
 shivasena chaahati he ki bhaajapa ke saath isi formule par samjhauta ho

 Some special things about Vinod Khanna aktubar 2008 kii 17 taarikh ko mohali main australia ke khilaaf sachin tendulkar ne test cricket main sabase zyada ran banane kaa bryan lara kaa record todaa or 12,000 ran paar karne vaale pehle cricketer bhi bane
 To commemorate this historic occasion, Sachin promised to give me an interview
 hamane is siries par export coment ke liye gavaskar se bhi sampark kiya
 Thus one evening during the Mohali Test, i came close to achieving cricket nirvana when Gavaskar and Tendulkar sat together to talk about cricket
 gavaskar paaramparik collardaar shart pahanakar aae, jabaki tendulkar zyada cajual polo-nek shart main the
 This difference in their attire reflected the generational difference between the two
 gavaskar or tendulkar, oonchi kamyaabiyaan hasil karne vaale do nate shaks—donon ne milakar 85 test shatak lagaae or 26,000 se zyada test ran banaae
 They are two towers of Indian cricket, one built in the classical style of cricket, the other far more bland, both evergreen magnates

 If Gavaskar gave dignity and self-respect to Indian cricket, Tendulkar brought energy and thrill with him
 gavaskar ne jab pehali baar tendulkar ko ballebaaji karte dekha, unhone usee vakt apni patni ko phone kiya or kaha ki unhone kuch bahut ''khaas" dekha he
 When Tendulkar was growing up, Gavaskar was a role model for him along with Sir Vivian Richards of the West Indies
 tendulkar kehete hai, ''main sar viv kaa jabardast fain tha, par gavaskar ke 10,000 ran or 34 shatak hameshaa cricket main mahanata hasil karne kii kasuti the
 It was not a deliberately set goal, but i think it was always somewhere in my mind
 "tendulkar aakhirkaar gavaskar ke recordon se aage nikal gaye, phir bhi donon ke bich khalis aankadon kii tulana aasaan nahin he
 Both scored runs in Test cricket at an average of over 50, but Gavaskar was the opening batsman, while Tendulkar batted at number four
 ek helmet se pehle ke daur main bane-bade, jabaki duusare ko helmet pahanakar khilne kaa phayda mila
 Gavaskar continued to play for a long time with the feeling that the entire batting of Indian batting was on him, while Tendulkar got the advantage of being part of a rare gathering of Indian batting stars including Sehwag, Dravid and Laxman in the second half of his career
 gavaskar us daur main oonche uthe jab rakshaatmak ballebaaji karnaa phydemand hua karata tha, jabaki tendulkar kaa daur cricket ke zyada aakraamak ballebaaji kii taraf jane kaa gavaah bana
 Gavaskar hit just one international hundred in limited-overs cricket, while Tendulkar hit an incredible 49 ODI centuries
 tamaam mahaan khiladinnon kii tarah ve kisi bhi halaat ke mutabik khud ko dhaal sakate the
 Tendulkar once batted for over 600 minutes against Australia in Sydney with a gruesome jolt and scored an unbeaten double century without hitting a single ball off-drive
 is bich gavaskar ne apni raftaar badali or angrej gendbaaji par dhaava bolte hue 1979 main ovel main doharaa shatak lagaaya or bharat ko aakhri din avishwasaneey jeet ke kareeb le aae
 Both had a very different batting style
 zyada sahi mudra ke saath khilne vaale gavaskar apekshaakrit halkaa balla istemaal karte the or gendbaaj ke haath se gend chhootane se pehle donon pairon ko halke-se pherbadal ke saath ek duusare se zyada najadik rakhte the
 At the same time, Tendulkar leaned slightly more with a heavier bat and unconventional bottom hand grip and kept the legs wide open
 gavaskar shaayad behatar cat lagaate the, jabaki tendulkar pul shot main zyada asardaar the
 Tendulkar's identity became as great as watching his back foot cover drive, as was Gavaskar's late cut shot
 donon apane-apane street drive, leg-said clic or single ko parakhane ke ustad the
 However, the thread they shared was their perfect movements at the right time, their calm and steady head, the straightness of their bats and their tremendous hunger and runs above everything else
 gavaskar ne thik vaise hi tendulkar ko viraasat saunp di jaise pichhali peedi ne unhen mashaal saunpi thi
 Tendulkar recalls, "I remember when Gavaskar gave me his pads as a gift, i slept with him because it was like a precious treasure to me
" "sadi badalte samay tendulkar ko apni sabase beshkeemtee vaahvahee tab mili jab hameshaa ke liye mahanatam ballebaaj maane jane vaale mahaan australian ballebaaj sar don breadman ne kaha ki tendulkar kii kasi hui, aakraamak ballebaaji kii style or khud unki style bahut milti-julati he
 a few months after praising Don Bradman, i interviewed Sachin Tendulkar and clearly he was not blown away by this comparison
 unhone behad garv se kaha tha, ''main nahin sochataa ki ballebaaj ke taur par main isse zyada kuch chaah saktaa hum, chaah saktaa hum kya?" 2001 main don breadman ke sadabahaar mahanatam gyaarah cricketron kii team main sachin tendulkar akele hindustani khilaadi the, par breadman kii us team main puure saat australian khiladinnon kaa hona bataata he ki cricket ke chayan main aksar sankeernata haaavee rahati thi
 For a more nuanced examination of his batting, i went to Milind Rege, a Mumbai-based cricketer who played cricket with Gavaskar since his typical school days, and was also one of the very first ones to see Tendulkar's talent
 Was lying ve kehete hai, ''do alahada peedhishon ke mahanayakon kii tulana kar paanaa behad mushkil he
 But i would definitely say that Tendulkar was rich in unique talent while Sunil was not
 gavaskar ne apane khel par kaam kiya or dhyaan ekagra karne kii gajab kii takat ke dam par sadabahaar mahaan khilaadi bane jabaki tendulkar 15 saal kii umr ke hone tak puri tarah se taiyaar or nikhare hue khilaadi the
 Once set, Gavaskar did not give you a chance, while Sachin was always under attack and therefore more likely to make mistakes
 ek lihaaj se sachin gendbaaji par haaavee hone kii ichha main viv richards kii tarah zyada the jabaki gavaskar paramparaagat galati rahit openar ballebaaj the
 "so, i asked reggae, who would you like to have in your team? ''kya main donon ko nahin le saktaa?" unhone aankh jhapakaate hue kaha
 Then he went on to say, "let me say it this way, i would love to have Sachin in my team, but i would love to let Gavaskar in the front team
" "kapil dev, jinhone donon ke liye gendbaaji kii he, bataate hai ki gavaskar ko out karnaa bahut mushkil tha, lekin tendulkar zyada pratibhashali the
 Kapil explains, "gavaskar always hit a bad ball, but Sachin could deliver a good ball outside the boundary
 " bharat ke ek sheersh alrounder kaa maananaa he ki sachin ne jitne ran banaae hai, unhen vastav main usase zyada ran banane chahie the
 He argues, "with his skill, he really should have scored triple and four centuries in Test cricket, Sachin was such a good player
" " tendulkar kaa test cricket main sarvaadhik score bangladesh ke khilaaf 248 ran par naabad he, jo shaayad sankhyikeey rup se thodaa kam lagata he, khaskar tab, jab aap sochate hai ki virendra sahvaag jaise samakaleen khilaadi ne test main do tihare shatak banaae the
 This probably indicates a mindset that is not risk-taking, especially when the opposition bowler was tired and faded
 jab maine tendulkar se is bare main poocha, to unhone muskaraate hue kaha, ''aap jivan main sab kuch nahin paa sakate, lekin test cricket main kareeb 16,000 ran bahut bura bhi nahin he, he kya?"gavaskar kii captaini kaa record behatar he, lekin koi tark kar saktaa he ki tendulkar ko behad anukool gharelu sthitiyon main team ke netritv kaa paryaapt avasar nahin mila
 He once told me, "yes, i regret not having a successful captaincy
 " aksar antarmukhi or kootnithik tendulkar kii tulana main behad mukhar or tej dimag vaale gavaskar cricket ke muddon par saarvajanik rup se zyada bolaa he
 Tendulkar never put his side firmly on the match-fixing controversy
 unhone mujhe bataaya, ''main tabhi bolta hum, jab jarurat mahasoos hoti he, lekin main aaropon ke aadhaar par halki baat karne main yakeen nahin karata
 "during a joint interview in Mohali, when i asked Gavaskar and Tendulkar who was the better player among the two, the two immediately pointed at each other
 gavaskar ne kaha, ''main tendulkar kii ballebaaji dekhne ke liye milon jaaoongaa, lekin yakeen nahin he ki main apane maukey par aisa kah paaungaa
 "he said that Tendulkar's balance was the right measure to measure his success
 ''maidan main santulan, jivan main santulan
 "tendulkar said that Gavaskar's professional ethics was inspiring to his generation
 yah paraspar sammaan kii bhaavana ek tarah se maharashtra kii madhyavargeey prishthbhumi pratibimbit karti he, jo mumbai cricket kii saajha viraasat kaa hissaa he
 This cricket was nurtured in the city grounds and strengthened by crowded buses and train travel to watch the match
 gavaskar ne khilne kii shuruyaat dakshin-madhya mumbai kii ek bheed bhari colony ke ek sankari gali se kii thi, jahaan gend par oonche shot kii jagah maidan se sate shot lagane hote the, taaki khidki kaa koi sheesha na toote
 Tendulkar, who plays in the suburban Mumbai's densely populated Sahitya Sahavas Colony, had little freedom: where you could hit a lofted shot, hit a tree, yet not be afraid of getting out, which could analyze his fiery game
 
 sambhawatah gavaskar or tendulkar ke fark ko udaarikaran se purv or baad ke cricket nayakon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 When Gavaskar emerged in the 1960s, India was not convinced of its place in the world
 1971 main jab unhone pehali siries kheli, to vah safalataa kaa saal tha, jisane bhartiya cricket kii bhavishya ke prati ummid jagaai
 But during Gavaskar's career, India was growing at a very slow pace, called the "hindu" growth rate, and cricket was mostly ignored - it was a time when spending too much on cricket was not allowed
 was
 lekin tendulkar ne jab apni chhap chodi, to bharat aage badhata hua raashtra ban gaya thah 1991 main khuli arthvyavastha ko bhartiya udhyamita ke liye bandhanon se mukti ke rup main dekha gaya
 Tendulkar's batting became a symbol of widespread freedom and risk-taking
 ve donon mumbai se aate hai, yah keval yahi dikhaata he ki aazaadee ke baad ke saath varshon main kaise yah shahar bhartiya ballebaaji ke centre main rahaa he
 However, there have been different indications in the last decade which show that Mumbai cricket's glory days are over, as other regions of the country have also given their heroes to Indian cricket
 (2016 main jab mumbai ke vankhede stadium main tendulkar ke sanyas lene ke baad pehla test match khelaa gaya tha, to usamen mumbai kaa ek bhi khilaadi nahin tha
 ) But respect for gavaskar-tendulkar's batting legacy remains in the original capital of Indian cricket
 hamaari peedi main gavaskar cricket ke bhagwaan the
 Tendulkar became the God of cricket for the generation of the ninth decade
 mumbai ke madhya main sthit siddhivinayak mandir lakhon shraddhaluon ko aakarshith karata he, thik usee tarah jaise haji ali dargah
 People from different religious groups come here to offer prayers
 lekin cricket main koi dharmik bandhan nahin he, jab ham mumbai main apane devtaa gavaskar or tendulkar kaa baraabar ke utsaah ke saath sammaan karte hai

 14 in the total population of the state
 6 fisadi yadav hai
 These figures are interesting in turn, because till now the BJP has been seen as a party of upper castes

 aise main agar vah yadavon ko todane main kaamyaab rahati he to isse mahagathbandhan ko bada jhatka lagegaa
 Not only this, Lalu Prasad's party is contesting only 101 seats, while Nitish has 101 seats and it is believed that JDU Yadav will give less preference to candidates

 rajasthan main bijepi kaa jhagada pradhanmantri narendra modi sulajhaanege
 The bjp's decision to contest the Dausa Lok Sabha seat of Rajasthan will be decided in Delhi on Friday
 darasal, bijepi rajya main apane 23 siton par ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar chuki he or vahiin ek seat gathbandhan ke rup main hanuman beniwal ko di gai he
 Despite this, the party has not been able to decide on one seat for 11 days
 dausa seat par congress 15 din pehle apane ummidavaar ke rup main vidhayak murari laal meena kii patni savita meena ko utaar chuki he
 bjp's quarrel is so much here that the candidates' names are not being decided, so Kirori Lal Meena has been called to Delhi by BJP National President Amit Shah and it is being said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also meet Meena
 kirodi laal meena or vasundhara raaje ke bich chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he 
 After getting angry with Vasundhara Raje, Kirori Lal Meena left the BJP and formed the National Democratic Party
 rashtriya swayan sangh or amit shah ke kehane par meena vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle bijepi main aa gaye the
 The BJP has never had a Meena leader bigger than Kirodi
 yah bhi sach he ki meena vot bank hameshaa se congress kaa hi rahaa he
 Meena has been associated with BJP because of Kirori Lal Meena
 pichley chunaav main kendriya netaaon ke dabaav main vasundhara raaje ne meena ko party main shaamil to kar liya lekin in donon ke bich kabhi bani nahin
 Now, while Vasundhara's fierce opponent Hanuman Beniwal has been given the Nagaur seat, Jaipur's Princess Diya Singh has been given a ticket from Rajsamand Lok Sabha seat despite Vasundhara's opposition
 aise main ab dausa seat par kirodi laal meena ke pasand kaa ummidavaar utaarne ke khilaaf kaha ja rahaa he ki vasundhara ne apana vito laga diya he 
 At the same time, Vasundhara Raje wants to field Jaskaur Meena of the faction against Kirodi Lal Meena as BJP candidate from Dausa, while Kausori Lal Meena has been special for Dausa seat from the beginning
 vah nahin chaahate hai ki yah sirf unke paas se kisi or ko jaae
 Kirori Lal Meena from Dausa has not only contested on BJP ticket against Rajesh Pilot, but independents have also been mps from here
 vasundhara raaje ne kirodi laal meena ke bijepi chhodane ke baad se vahaan ke sthaneey meena netaa om prakaash hudla ko lekar ain or omprakash hudla ne mahua vidhansabha seat par jeet darj kii thi
 However, after the arrival of Kirori Lal Meena, bjp's new Meena leader Omprakash Hudla ticket was cut and in place of Kirori Lal Meena's nephew Rajendra Meena
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main kirodi laal meena ke bhattije rajendra meena ko omprakash hudla ne nirdaleey chunaav main khadaa hokar rajendra meena ko haraa diya tha
 It is being told that in this Lok Sabha election, Vasundhara was wishing that Hoodla's wife or Hulla should be fought from Dausa seat
 jab baat nahin bani to kirodi laal meena ke duusare virdohi kheme se jascor meena ko saamne kar di hai or yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki vasundhara raaje is baar is kadar naaraaz hai ki abhi tak chunaav prachaar par nahin nikali hai
 It is believed that after the intervention of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi, the BJP candidate will be announced in Dausa seat
 bijepi alaakaman ne vasundhara ko manaane ke liye jascor meena ko dausa seat se utarane kaa man bana liya he
 But due to Kirodi Lal Meena's displeasure, this is not possible
 bijepi ke liye musiibat yah he ki agar kirodi laal meena ke pasand kaa ummidavaar nahin hota he to vah bijepi kii dausa seat se raah mushkil bana sakate hai, saath hi iskaa asar dausa ke aasapaas kii 12 meena bahulya siton par bhi pad saktaa he

 ’ Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has suggested to learn from Israel by pointing to the foreign forces raising their heads towards India
 madhya pradesh ke sagar main RSS ke shivi ke samaapan maukey par ravivaar ko bhagwat ne kaha, 'hamaare desh ko aazaadee milane ke saath ek or desh astitv main aayaa tha, vah tha israel
 Our country has thousands of square kilometers of land, but that country does not have moist land, whatever land is there is desert
 'mohan bhagwat ne aage kaha ki sari duniya main jagah-jagah bhatak rahe yahudee log apana sabakuch tyaag karke basane ke liye saal 1948 main israel pahunche
 When they reached there, they had nothing
 jis din vahaan kii nai sansad main desh kii aazaadee kii ghoshnaa kii ja rahi thi, usee samay aasapaas ke aath deshon kii senaaon ne milakar us par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack took place when the freedom speech was going on in the Parliament there
 bhagwat ne bataaya ki uske baad in deshon se israel ko paanch ladaaiyaan ladani padin
 He said, 'where does this country stand today? This desert country has become the number one country in the world
 aaj haal yah he ki kam pani vaali kheti kaa tantra seekhney ke liye hamaare desh ke log vahaan jate hai
 The RSS chief said, "not only that, he exports many of his products to the world
" usne kai ladaaiyaan ladiin or jiti bhi
 Each time expanded its range
 jab yah desh bana tha, tab se aaj uskaa kshetrafal dedh guna he or duniya ke saamne sir uthaakar khadaa he
 'mohan Bhagwat further said that no one has the courage to look at Israelis and Jews with a sharp eye and whoever does so, their eyes burst
 yah uski samarthy kii baat he
 He said, 'compared to that, we have thousands of square kilometers of land and a population of crores
 swatantraaa kaa utsaah sabake man main he, uske baad bhi ham kahaan khadey hai, yah vichaarneey he
 '--- Input from IANS 28 saal ke baad ek baar phir itihaas ne bharat kaa imtihaan liya he
 After India won the 1983 World Cup, when England had traveled to the semi-finals of the 1987 World Cup and was dreaming of winning the World Cup for the second time in a row, England had snatched this opportunity from India
 aaj ek baar phir sidney ke shandaar maidan par bharat se yah mauka australia ne chin liya he
 The captain at that time was Kapil Dev, today Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 anhoni ko honi karne vaale dhoni aaj fail hue hai
 Today luck also did not support India, after winning the toss seven times in a row, Mahendra Singh Dhoni lost the toss today
 pehle bowling karte hue bharat ko jaldi safalataa bhi mili
 David Warner fell to Umesh Yadav with his personal score of just 12, then Australia's score was just 15 runs
 lekin bharat is maukey kaa phayda nahin uthaa payaa
 a superb partnership of 181 for the second wicket between Aaron Finch and Steve Smith took the partnership away from India
 pichley paanch match main sirf 64 ran banane vaale finch ne bharat ke khilaaf behtareen 81 ran kii pari kheli or steve smith kaa to koi jawaab nahin
 Against India, Smith hit a brilliant century
 duusare wicket ke rup main jab steve smith apane vyaktigat score 105 ran par out hue tab bharat ke haath se match nikal gaya tha
 Now it was difficult to stop Australia
 steve smith ke out hone ke baad bharat ke gendbaaj zarur kuch wicket lene main safal hue lekin michel johnson ko rokane main naakaamayaab hue
 Johnson faced just 9 balls and scored a quick 27, bringing Australia's score to 328 runs
 ravichandran aswin or rabindra jadeja australia ke ballebaajon ko rokane main thodaa kaamyaab hue lekin mohammad shami, umesh yadav or mohit sharma ko kaaphi maar padi
 The trio together gave 215 runs in 29 overs
 batting ke dauraan bharat kabhi haaavee hota nazar nahin aayaa
 Yes, there was a ray of victory when Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan had a brilliant partnership of 76 runs for the first wicket
 aise bhi aaj tak world cap ke itihaas main kabhi bhi semifinal match ke dauraan 300 se zyada ran kaa peechha karte hue kisi bhi team ko jeet nahin mili he
 New Zealand defeated South Africa during the first semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup, chasing the highest 298 runs during the World Cup semi-finals
 agar bharat kii baat kii jaae to bharat ne 1983 world cap ke semifinal main sabase zyada 213 ran kaa peechha karte hue england ko haraaya tha
 In any case, India has never scored more than 300 runs in the semi-finals of the World Cup, whether batting first or chasing runs
 world cap ke semitinal main bharat kaa sarvaadhik score 270 ran rahaa he or yah score bharat ne 2003 ke world cap ke semifinal ke dauraan pehle ballebaaji karte hue kenya ke khilaaf banaaya tha
 India's batsmen disappointed today
 achche shuruyaat milane ke baavjood bharat match haar gaya
 Australia scored 56 runs for one wicket in their bowling power play i
e
 the first ten overs while India scored 55 runs without losing wickets and the match was in India's hands
 15 se lekar 30 over tak jahaan australia ne wicket bachaae rakhe or match main pakad banane main kaamyaab hua vahiin bharat ke ballebaajon ne kharaab shot khelte hue apane wicket ganvaae or match haar gaye
 Due to the wicket in hand, Australia scored 64 runs in their batting powerplay or five overs, while India could score only 26 runs
 dhoni ne bharat kii taraf se sabase zyada 65 ranon kii pari kheli lekin bharat ko jeet kii kareeb nahin pahunchaa paae
 When Australia had set a target of 329 runs in front of India, the match went out of India's hands
 jeet kaa sutara bhi aaj bharat ke saath nahin rahaa
 India has won all their matches when Shikhar Dhawan has scored more than 50 runs
 lekin dhawan aaj sirf 45 ran bana paae
 When India has lost less than 3 wickets for 30 overs, then India has won more than 70 percent of the matches
 lekin aaj bharat 30 over tak 130 ran par chaar wicket gavaan chukaa tha
 Australia has won 92 per cent of matches whenever Mitchell Starc has taken two or more wickets against India and today Stark also gets two wickets

 narendra modi sarkaar kargil yuddh main shahid hue saurabh kaaliya or paanch anya bhartiya javaanon ko nyaay dilaane ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 The government said in Parliament that the issue would not be raised in international courts
 aapako bataa den ki saal 1999 menkargil yudhke dauraan 4 jat regiment ke captain saurabh kaaliya ke saath paanch anya bhartiya javaanon ko pakistani sainikon ne bandhak bana liya tha
 Pakistan tortured them a lot and they died after some time due to inhuman treatment
 inke shav ko jabpakistan ne bharatbheja to parivaar or desh dekhakar shav kii haalat dekhakar dahal gaya
 Since then, the family has been demanding action against Pakistani soldiers
 vahiin, jab pichley dinon sansad main is mudde ko uthaaya gaya ki kya is hatya ke maamle ko international court of justise (isije) ke saamne rakhaa jayega, jisase pakistani sainikon ko sajaa mil sake? to jawaab main sarkaar ne kaha, 'is maamle ko neuyork adhiveshan ke dauraan 22 sitambar 1999 ko or maanavadhikaar ayog ko april 2000 main hi avgat kara diya gaya he
 All aspects of legal action were also considered through international court, but this does not seem possible
 'lagbhag ek saal pehle utyub par ek video bhi viral hua tha, jisamen ek pakistani sainik sweekaarta he ki 32 saal ke ek army officer ko kargil yuddh ke dauraan bandhak banaakar usapar khub atyaachaar kiya gaya tha
 At that time there was a Vajpayee government in the country, there has been a demand for justice since then and today there is a BJP government, but the matter is being suppressed
 saurabh kaaliya ke pita ne supreme court main nyaay ke liye arji lagaai thi, lekin is par kuch nahin kiya gaya
 Let me tell you that Captain Saurabh Kalia of the 4 Jat Regiment was the first army officer who reported the Pakistani incursion into Kargil in 1999
 unhen paanch javaanon ke saath 15 may 1999 ko pakad liya gaya tha
 On 6 June 1999, the Pakistani Army returned the body to the Indian Army

 Apart from this, the eye was shattered

 At the same time, Saurabh's father is very angry with this attitude of the government towards the soldiers
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe laga tha bijepi sarkaar zyada deshbhakt hogi, lekin afsos kii ye sarkaar bhi waisi hi he
 It is clear from the statement of Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh on the question asked in Parliament by MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar that even the new government is not in favor of providing justice to the Kargil men
 'ullekhneey he ki saurabh kaaliya ke pita enke kaaliya ne 2012 main supreme court kaa rukh kiya
 They demand that the Ministry of External Affairs take up the issue in the International Court of Justice so that the Pakistani soldiers who killed their son can take action against them, because such treatment is a violation of the Geneva Convention with prisoners of war
 saurabh ke pita enke kaaliya 16 saal baad bhi apane bete ke liye nyaay ke liye ladaai kar rahe hai

 Then came the voice of an old man from behind, 'E bar ta na, but next time son should become MLA
 ' matlab is baar to nahin lekin agali baar jarur vidhayak banoge

 bhartiya puratathvik surveykshan vibhaag (eesai) chahta he ki duniyabar main mashhoor aitihaasik paryaton sthal tajmahal par pahunchane vaale logon main se kisi ko bhi teen-chaar ghante se zyaada vahaan nahin rukne diya jaae
 In fact, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice TS Thakur of the country had sought detailed information on measures to contain the number of tourists within the memorial, so ASI advocate ADN Rao on Monday made these proposals
 Gave the information of the court
 court dwaara yah puche jane par ki taj ke bheetar paryatakon kii sankhya ko kaise kaabo main rakhaa ja sakegaa, to adhivaktaa ne kaha ki chunki tajmahal ke bheetar ek hi vakt par bahut zyaada log maujuud rahete hai, so, uske ilaaj ke rup main har paryatak ke rukne kii avadhi ko simit kiye jane par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The comments court ko bataaya gaya ki eesai kaa iraadaa he ki alag-alag rang ke tikat beche jaaenge, taaki pataa chalata rahe ki koun-sa paryatak kis vakt se bheetar aayaa hua he, or kis vakt tak use bheetar rahane diya ja saktaa he
 According to ASI, this way will prevent those tourists, who reach the Taj Mahal early in the morning, and stay there till its closure
 adhivaktaa ke anusaar, is prastaav par gambhirtha se vichaar jari he, or jald hi ise antim rup die jane kii sambhaavna he
 In addition, the ASI has requested the court to allow five sessions of 45-45 minutes to be run in place of eight sessions of 30–30 minutes each to showcase the interior of the Taj Mahal, so that tourists Complaints of not giving enough time can be resolved
 darasal, desh ke pradhan nyaayadhish justise ties thakur kii adhyakshata vaali supreme court kii peeth ne smarak ke bheetar paryatakon kii sankhya ko kaabo main rakhane ke upayon ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree maangi thi, so, somvaar ko eesai ke adhivaktaa adien raav ne in prastaavon kii jaankaree court ko di
 When asked by the court how the number of tourists within the Taj can be kept under control, the advocate said that since a large number of people are present inside the Taj Mahal at the same time, every tourist as a treatment Limiting the period of stay is being considered
 tippaniyan The court was told that the ASI intends that tickets of different colors will be sold, so that it remains to be known which tourist has come in since, and for which time they can be allowed to stay inside
 eesai ke mutabik, is tarah un paryatakon ko roka ja sakegaa, jo subah tajmahal khulte hi bheetar pahunch jate hai, or uske band hone tak vahiin rahete hai
 According to the lawyer, the proposal is under serious consideration, and is likely to be finalized soon
 iske atirikt eesai ne court ne is baat kaa anurodh kiya he ki tajmahal ke bhitari hisson ko dikhaane ke liye chalaae jane vaale 30-30 minute ke aath satron ke sthaan par 45-45 minute ke paanch satr chalaane kii ijazat di jaae, taaki paryatakon kii paryaapt vakt nahin die jane kii shikaayat dur kii ja sake

 The motorcycle and Nilgai herd suddenly collided in Washim district of Maharashtra
 bhidnt itani joardaar thi ki do motor cycle savaar samet baari-bharkam nilgai bhi buree tarah zakhmi ho gai
 In the accident, the last leg of the illustrious Nilgai has been broken
 jakhmi bike savaaron ko to turant ambulance se paas ke aspataal main ilaaj ke liye le jaaya gaya lekin bejubaan nilgai kisi se apana dard nahin kah paa rahi thi, jabaki uski chhot ghayal hue logon se zyada gambhir thi
 After the accident, she panicked and Babes Nilgai was seeing it all with her own eyes, trying to understand what is happening around
 vah uthakar bhaagna chaah rahi thi lekin pichley pairon ne saath chhod diya tha
 Looking at her, it seemed that she was suffering a lot but she could not shout, nor tell anyone
 sadak haadase ke kareeb ek ghante baad vanvibhag karmi us nilgai ko ek gaadi main daalkar akola vanvibhag lekar aaye or phir nilgai kaa ilaaj shuru kiya gaya
 The team of Veterinary doctors connected Senilgai's leg with great readiness
