 desh ke sabase bade siyaasi ohade ke liye narendra modi kii yogyata par sawaal uthaate hue congress mahasachiv mohan prakaash ne kataaksh kiya ki jis shaks ne ab tak sansad kaa darwaja bhi nahin dekha, use bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main chunavi maidan main utaar diya he
 Mohan Prakash said in a conference of Congress workers, the person (modi) who has not even seen the door of Parliament till date, is the bjp's prime ministerial candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 unhone bhaajapa par hamalaa karte hue kaha, ham mazdooron, kisaanon or aam logon ke adhikaron par chunavi bahes karnaa chaahate hai
 But instead of debating these issues, politics of insults and hatred is being done
 chaay par charchaa karke 200 karod rupee kharch kiye ja rahe hai
 Mohan Prakash objected sharply to the statement of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, in which he described Modi as 'hair of mustache' and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as 'hair of tail'
 madhyapradesh ke prabharee congress mahasachiv ne kaha ki ‘chote miyaan’ shivaraj ko janata ko bataanaa chaiye ki vah sharir ke kis hisse ke bal hai
 Mohan Prakash alleged that not a single worker of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or BJP was involved in India's freedom struggle

 He was killed by a Hindustani

 kung phu master jaiki chaiyn us samay hairaan ho gaye, jab unhone suna ki kung phu bharat kii kala he
 The entire career of Chinese artist Chan is due to this kung fu
 unhen tajjub ho rahaa he ki jis kala ko vah china kii dein samaj rahe the, asal main vah padosi mulk bharat kii khoj he
 Jackie Chan has returned from India two days ago
 vahfilm 'baagi' kii shootingke silsile main rajasthan ke kai lokeshnon par saat dinon tak vyast the
 During this, he came to know from a statement by actor Tiger Shroff that Kung Fu is the gift of India
 saath hi unhen yah bhi bataaya gaya ki bhartiya buddha sant bodhidharma ne marshall art kung phu kii khoj kii thi
 According to some people associated with the film unit, Jackie Chan was seen diverted from work on the set of the film throughout the day after hearing these things from Tiger's son Tiger
 unhone apane kru se lekar kai kareebi doston ko phone par ye baaten bataayin
 Sometimes surprisingly, sometimes laughing, as if these things of Tiger did not digest them
 chaiyn baichaiyn isliye ho gaye, kyonki unhen ab yah ahsaas hua ki lagbhag aadhi jindagi unhone yah sochakar bitaa di ki china nevishwa ko kung phu diya
 Chan is upset, because Kung Fu's ambassador or his shadow is considered by Jackie Chan
 rishi kapur kaa ek bayaan phir ek baar vivaad kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Without naming anyone, he said that there are many people in the industry who do not know acting
 haal hi main rishi ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan bataaya ki film industry main kai saare aise actor bhi hai, jinhen pataa hi nahin ki acting kya hoti he
 Rishi Kapoor is considered quite straight forward
 wo soshal media par khulkar apni raay rakhte hai
 During an interview to Leading Daily, he spoke about the changing nature of Bollywood
 unhone kaha ki mujhe hameshaa lagata he ki film kii patakatha hi film kii jaan hoti he
 i worked in a lot of films, which were content-based films
 media se naaraaz hue rishi, kaha- shridevi achaanak 'body' kaise ban gayirushi ne prem rog, damini or tawayph jaisi filmon main kaam kiya tha jisaki patakatha main kaaphi dam tha
 He said that even though the film lacked action scenes, these films achieved great success on the basis of their content
 acting ke bare main baat karte hue rishi ne kaha ki film industry main kai saare aise abhinayta hai jinako pataa hi nahin he ki acting kya hoti he
 Begging for acting and getting roles through various recommendations is the wrong way
 ek actor ko to acchhee acting aani hi chahie
 Rishi Kapoor on PNB fraud case - not just Nirav, will be involved and even more famous films are made to be a hit here: Talking about films in the Rishimojud era, he says that a variety of films are being made these days

 When asked about Indian films going to the International Film Festival and not winning the award, he said that the film festivals do not make much difference in the industry
 yahaan par filmein festivels ke liye nahin banati hai
 Films are made here so that they can reach more people and become commercially hits

 ' Milind Ekbote, president of Hindu Janajagaran Samiti and Sambhaji Bhide Guruji, the founder of Shiv Pratishthan in Kolhapur city, have been accused of inciting riots in Bhima Koregaon
 pune ke pimpri chinchvad ilaake main donon par danga bhadakaane kaa police cese bhi darj kiya gaya
 But Milind Ekbote's brother considers him completely innocent
 jab se dange hue he tab se milind ekbote gaayab ho gaye hai
 On Saturday, Aaj Tak's team spoke to Milind Ekbote's brother on charges of inciting riots
 milind ekbote ke chote bhai nandkumar ekbote ne har ek sawaal par safai dete hue kaha, 'milind ekbote sau pratishat nahin, balki ek hajaar pratishat nirdosh, kyonki hamaare bhai vadhu budruk gaye hi nahin the, bhide guruji bhi waha nahin gaye the
 Usually, the enraged Guruji and our family keep coming and going there, but none of us went there on the day of the riots
 hamaare ghar main teen din dharmik kaarykram tha
 So all three brothers were at home
 31 disambar, 1 or 2 janvari ko pune ke ghar par hi the
 "why shall we make holes in the plate we eat", said brother of Milind Ekbote, Ekbote family has been associated with Vadhu village for the last twenty-five years
 gaavvaalon ke saath milakar parivaar dharmaveer sambhaji maharaj ke samadhi kaa kaam waha kar rahaa he
 Where we are working, why there will spoil work
 jis thali main khate he, vahaan ham chhed kyon karenge? kuch logon ko ikaitha karke udhar bheja he
 This is completely wrong and whatever video clip has gone viral, investigate it and check the message on social media as well
 ye chunauti he media ko
 'he said,' After 100 years it is wrong to create the dilemma that you are a Dalit, you are a Maratha
 ' do sau saal pehle jo bhima koregaanv kii ladaai hui thi, jisamen peshwaon ko angrejon ke sena ke bahadur dalit phogiyon ne parajeet kiya tha, uskaa dard aaj bhi man main he or isiilie hindutvvaadi sanghathanon ne bavaal karne kaa prayaas kiya tha aisa kaha ja rahaa he
 On this, Nandkumar Ekbote said, '200 years ago there was a fight between the British and Indians, there is no relation of caste, there is a history of who was with the British and who was with the Indians
 ab do sau saal baad kisi ke man main ye duvidha paidaa karnaa, is madhyam se ki aap dalit ho, aap maratha ho, ye bahut galat he
 'ekbote said that in this era we are talking about going to Mars and some people are conspiring here by quarreling with caste, this is a very wrong thing
 aisa to kuch hamaare bhai or bhide guruji ne nahin kiya he
 Sambhaji Maharaj always inspires us
 unase deshbhakti bade itnaa hi hamaara kaam he
 Viral post on social media is not ours when Nandkumar Ekbote was asked that a post has gone viral on social media and this post was made viral to provoke riots
 isko puri tarah se khaarij karte hue karte ekbote ne bataaya ke post main likhaa he 'chalo vadhu budruk' aisa likhnaa hi darshata he ke ye kisi or bhashaa vaale logon ne likhaa he
 Milind Ekbote is a member of the committee and he will write 'chala Vadhu Budruk'
 to aisi post viral karnaa, logon ko gumraah karnaa he
 The intention is to discredit Milind Ekbote
 ab ye sibar krime cell kaa kaam he ki is post kii tah tak jaaen or use kadi se kadi sajaa den jisane ye post viral kii he
 On why Milind Ekbote is hiding secretly, if Milind Ekbote is not guilty then why is he sitting secretly, Ekbote's brother said that he will come out at the right time and give clarification
 sambhaji maharaj kii samadhi sabakaa prerana sthanjab milind ekbote ke bhai ko bataaya gaya ki vadhu gramsabha ne prastaav paarit kiya he ki ab gaanv ke kisi bhi samaaroh main yani chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj kii punyatithi / jayanti samaaroh main baahar ke logon kaa hastkshep nahin hone denge
 Nandkishore Ekbote said that taking such a decision is ridiculous
 sambhaji maharaj kii samadhi par kaam karnaa koi jurm to nahin or baahar vaala koun he ye to gaanv waalon ko tay karnaa padegaa
 In the past, there have been allegations of inciting riots, Ekbote family, before Parbheema Koregaon, denied the charge of instigating riots near Pratapgarh, Ekbote said that in 2003 there was no violence, there was a clash between police and activists
 2003 main jo hua he wo bhi ek shadyantra hi he
 To discredit the Ekbote family as it is happening today
 lekin jab yaad dilaayaa gaya ki donon bhaaiyon ko to 12 din kii jail hui thi, tab ekbote bole ki aise aarope to kai logon par lage hai, aise aarope to aate-jate hai, siddh to nahin hue

 After a long wait of 16 years, the Congress finally managed to send one of its mps from Bihar to the Rajya Sabha
 savarna bhoomihaar jati se taalluk rakhane vaale akhilesh singh bihar se congress ke rajyasabha saansad bane
 In April, the party also sent a Brahmin Premchand Mishra to the Legislative Council
 savarnon ko achaanak itani tarjeeh dena kya congress ke kisi nai or badi rajnatik tarkeeb kaa hissaa he?party ke ek varisht netaa maanate hai ki in nirnyon kaa akalan bahut gambhirtha se or gaharaai se kiya ja rahaa he
 He says, "both Akhilesh and Mishra won because they got the support of the RJD on the advice of Laloo Prasad Yadav
 '' lekin pratyaashiyon kaa chayan koi aakasmik ghatana nahin he
 Seeing the 'guarantee' of a large vote bank of Muslim, Yadav and OBC class from Lalu, the Congress has focused on wooing the upper castes of Bihar, which is not very big in number in the state but is very influential
 padosi uttar pradesh se ulat bihar kii sirf 11 se 12 pratishat aabaadi hi savarna he lekin rajd, lojpa, jad (you), ralospa jaisi partiyon main nichali jatiyon or obisi vot ke bant jane ke kaaran savarna vot kii ahmiyat sankhya main zyada na hone ke baavjood kaaphi bad jaati he
 The upper caste, once a voter of the Congress, moved with the BJP in the late 1990s
 rajd or jad (you) ne use lubhaane kii bahut koshishen kii phir bhi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon tak vah bhaajapa ke saath majbootee se khadaa rahaa
 In the year 2000, RJD had also raised the voice of five percent reservation for the poor of the upper castes and to woo this class, Nitish government even formed the Forward Caste Commission, yet the upper caste vote did not budge and BJP Remained with bhaajapa ke agadi jati ke vot bank main pehali baar 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main send lagati dikhi, jab congress ne rajd or jad (you) ke saath gathbandhan main 27 siten jeet leen
 Election strategist Prashant Kishor's strategy was to give the Congress more seats in partnership to make a dent in the bjp's vote bank
 congress ne 16 savarna pratyaashee utaare, jisamen se 12 jeet gaye
 The growing acceptance for the Congress among the forward castes was a major push for the BJP
 rajd ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki agadon ne 2015 main congress ke paksh main vot kiya jo darshata he ki unke man main ab lalu ke prati pehle jaisi nafrat kii bhaavana nahin he
 Despite not being large in number, the upper castes of Bihar have dominated politics, especially in urban areas
 philhal 40 main se 15 loksabhaa saansad savarna jatiyon ke hai
 In 2015, out of 243 assembly seats in the state, 51 seats were won by the candidates of the forward category
 bihar main yadav, muslim, savarna gathjod aaj tak kabhi nahin bana he
 If a coalition manages to forge such an alliance, then Ratti is not in doubt that the condition of his opponents will be diluted
 par aisa bhi nahin he ki bhaajapa chupchaap haath par haath dhare baithi rah jaaegi or virdohi uske vot bank main sendhamari kar lenge
 The BJP has also started revamping its social engineering to replicate its fierce 2014 victory

 maine unki tarah khilne kii koshish nahin kii

 Apart from this, there is a chance to play under the guidance of the world's top coaches
 ummid he ki is lig se bhartiya hockey ke liye khilaadiyon kaa pool bada hoga
 'there were to be six teams in the first league but no one bought the Bangalore franchise
 iske baad holland ke mahaan draig flikar taike takema chot ke kaaran lig se baahar ho gaye
 His participation was then questioned by nine Pakistani players due to late visa delays, although they were later granted visas
 kaagajon par barabari kii dikh rahi timen pichley do saptaah se saath abhyaas kar rahi he
 Punjab captain Dwyer admitted that it is a big challenge to mold players from different countries as one unit
 unhone kaha ,‘apane desh kii team kii captaini karnaa aasaan hota he lekin alag alag deshon se aaye khilaadiyon ko ek ikai ke rup main baandhna chunauteepurn he
 Coordination within and outside the field will be the key to success in the league and i am sure this league will prove to be miraculous for the Indian hockey
 ’ pichley do olympic main swarna padak jeetne vaali german team ke captain fusrte ke anusaar is lig se bhartiya haaki kaa purana gaurav lautaane main madad milegi
 He said, 'I have never seen a craze of hockey like India
 is lig se bhartiya hockey kaa purana gaurav lautaane main madad milegi
 The young players of India will get to learn a lot from the world's top players and coaches
 dach or german lig se jis tarah europea haaki ko phayda mila he, usee tarah bhartiya haaki ke liye yah lig madadgaar hogi
 The world's top coaches include Rick Charlesworth (mumbai) of Australia, Dutch Roland Oltmens (UP), Australia's Barry Dancer (punjab), South Africa's Greg Clarke and India's Ajay Bansal (delhi)
 ex ne is lig ko apane antarrashtriya calendar main 30 din kaa windo diya he yani is dauraan duniya main kahin bhi uskaa koi toornament nahin hoga
 After the opening ceremony on 14 January, the first match will be between Sardar Singh-led Delhi Waveriders and Jamie Dwyer's JP Punjab Warriors
 stadium main darshakon ko khinchne ke liye isamen pravesh nishulk rakhaa gaya he
 Delhi has forward players such as Yuvraj Valmiki of India, Gurvinder Singh Chandy, Danish Mujtaba, besides Mohammad Rizwan Sr
 of Pakistan and Simon Child of New Zealand
 vahiin plamekar kii bhoomika main duniya ke sarvshereshth paanch khilaadiyon main shumaar sardaar kaa saath gurbaj singh denge
 He has suffered due to the absence of drag flicker Takema but Rupinder Pal Singh is in good form
 duusari ore punjab ke paas bhartiya or austrailian khilaadiyon kaa acha mishran he
 Coach Dancer said, 'we will play a mixed form of Australian and Indian style
 jor aakraamak hockey par hi rahegaa
 Punjab has tremendous strikers like Dwyer, SV Sunil, Shivendra Singh and Kiran Govers
 vahiin midfield main simon orchard , raab hamand (australia) or lucas re (argentina) honge

 pdf This is the tagline of Kaun Banega Crorepati 11 this time
 7 karod rakam jeetne ke liye khelaa jayega 16 sawaalon kaa khel
 Amit Rameshbhai Jeevani of Gujarat became the first contestant of the show
 19 saalon se jari sawaal-jawaab kaa khel koun banegaa karodpati 19 agast ko ek baar phir shuru hua
 Gyan's 11th school of television started at 9 pm as before
 khel kii shuruyaat hui kebisi ke jaadugar amitabh bachchan kii damdaar aawaaj se
 This time he recited a poem reciting the tagline of Kaun Banega Crorepati, Ade Raho
 gar junun he sar par tere or antar main ho vishwaas,phir thokar or thukaraane kaa hoga kahaan tumhen ehsaas
 If there is truth in the motive, then say the same thing to the chest, you have to bow down
 ade raho, ade raho, ade raho
 
 
 The world has changed, whoever got denied earlier, lost the humiliation and got the gift of taunts
 har shwaas main vishwaas baro laharon ke vipareet baho,haathon main vijay mashaal liye
 Stand on faith
 ade raho, ade raho, ade raho
 
 
 Choose your dreams yourself and weave them with the string of faith, you the hero of victory roar, what you have to do with the lullaby
 tum swayan siddh is jivan ke, unmukt gagan main udo chalo,aarambh aaj se navayug kaa, vishwaas main apane khadey raho
 Stay sticky, stay sticky, stay sticky
 
 
 is kavita ke saath-saath hui kebisi ke manch par amitabh bachchan kii entry
 Even though with the journey of 19 years of KBC, Amitabh Bachchan is moving forward in his age
 lekin unki energy main aaj bhi koi kami nahin he
 a new chapter of Kaun Banega Crorepati started with the same voice, the same chawl and the welcome, gratitude, greetings of the ladies gentlemen
 koun bana pehla contestant?amitabh ne sho ke dauraan fastest finger first kaa sawaal poocha
 This round was won by a contestant from Gujarat
 amitabh bachchan ke saath quij sho khilne vaale pehle contestant amit rameshbhai jivanani bane
 He has been a teacher and former gym trainer
 kebisi 11 kaa safar apane sawaalon or javaabon ke saath shuru ho gaya
 View this post on instagramahead of tonight's grand launch of # KBC, here's an exclusive preview of the opening of the first episode! Watch # KBC, starting tonight, mon-fri at 9 PM
 @amitabhbachchana post shared bysony Entertainment Television(@sonytvofficial) onaug 19, 2019 at 2:21am pdtkesa he is baar sho?koun banegaa karodpati kaa 11 waan sijan pehle ke sijan kii tarah he
 This time too, there are the same rules as seen in the earlier seasons
 aise main ye sawaal uthta he ki kebisi ko wo tiarapy milegi, kyonki puraane kalevar main nayaa sijan aksar chal nahin paata he
 However, the real answer to this question is Amitabh Bachchan
 bhale hi kalevar purana ho lekin sho kaa aakarshan aaj bhi pehle jaisaa he
 Any contestant in the show has to go through a game of question and answer to win 7 crores
 pehle din ke sho kaa rispance behad shandaar rahaa he
 This can be gauged from social media
 sho ke shuru hote hi amitabh bachchan ke sho ke kai screenshot or tasviren viral huin
 This time the show will complete the 13-week journey
 iskaa elaan pehle hi din kar diya gaya
 a round of speculation continues regarding the budget of the new fiscal year
 itnaa to tay he ki bajet jan aakankshaon se itar hoga, yani jeb or dhili hogi
 The Finance Minister himself has indicated that the budget will not be breathtaking
 isliye logon ko abhi se chintaa sataane lagi he
 As far as inflation is concerned, after several taxes, the income is already being reduced by bringing about one hundred and fifty services under the service tax
 is bich sanyukt raashtra sangh kii report main kaha gaya he ki bharat arthvyavastha kii drushti se aage rahegaa tathaa 2016 main utpaadan vruddhi kii dar 7
 3 and 7 in 2017
 5 hogi
 But the situation is saying something else, do you think something like this will happen? bazaar suune pade hai
 Both buying and selling are lacking
 sone ke daam upar neeche ho rahe hai
 The steel sector is reeling
 share bazaar ek ajeeb si uhapoh main he
 The disastrous situation of industries and factories is also worrying
 bajet ko lekar jo sanket mil rahe hai, usase lagata he ki is baar sarkari kharcho ko badhaane par jor diya ja saktaa he, kyonki vetan ayog kii siforeeshon, sainikon kii badi pension or capital expendichar jaise kaamon ke liye dhan kii jarurat to padegi
 But the question is, where will the money come from? bajet main nivesh badaye jane par jor diya ja saktaa he
 But how effective it will be in the current situation, it is too early to say, because in the last budget, a target of disinvestment of Rs 69500 crore was set, whereas the government has barely got Rs 12700 crore
 idhar ghate vaali sarkari companiyon main vinievesh to puri tarah naakaam rahaa
 In order to increase income, the plan to convert the post office into a bank was also not successful, whereas the Reserve Bank has also given a license for it
 bajet main sabase badi chunauti corporate tex ghataane or jiesti kii taraf badhane ke intjaam jaruri hai
 If there is a reduction of 1 percent in the corporate tax, then the government treasury will reduce the income by 6 to 7 thousand crores
 nishchit rup se yah badi rakam he
 In this budget, drastic measures can also be taken by the Modi government regarding the much publicized black money
 sambhav he ki tay seemaa se zyada nakadi rakhane par pabandi lage
 In order to stop black money transactions in the name of donations in schools and colleges, it should be necessary to give donations by cross check
 anumaanath: keval embibies daakhilon main puure desh main lagbhag 12 hajaar karod rupayon kaa kalaadhan istemaal hota he
 In the last budget, it was announced to disclose black money, special scheme
 skim bhi ai lekin, apekshanusaar kalaadhan nahin aayaa
 The ambitious gold monetization scheme remained the same
 yojana to ai lekin sona nadaarad rahaa
 These are half the incomplete announcements of the last budget
 is bajet main manapsand selary brallep tay karne kii sambhaavna he
 For this, the company which has 40 or more employees will be able to decide whether to deposit money in provident fund or not and will also have the freedom to choose the preferred scheme for health insurance
 maujuuda vittvarsh main sarkaar vinievesh lakshya se kaaphi peeche chal rahi he
 There is no scope for improvement in the situation in the remaining two months
 aise main nishchit rup se sara daaromadar aam aadmi ke kandhon par hi padataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 It may be that the Finance Minister has already given the same indication, saying that the budget is not attractive to the public
 saste rail kiraaye ko lekar vitt mantralay or rail mantralay pehle hi aamane-saamne jaise sthiti main hai
 To whose account should the subsidy on cheap passenger fare and cheap grain transportation be made? rail mantralay chahta he vitt mantralay uthaae or vitt mantralay taiyaar nahin he
 Should the burden fall directly on the common man's shoulders amidst this controversy over subsidies? idhar 'deloit' survey ke ishaaron ko samajhen to bhartiya companiyaan apane vafaadaar karmchaariyon ke jane ke bhay se bhi bhaybheet hai
 Employees are dissatisfied with their role in the company, which is said to encourage youth for leadership positions
 yah vaaki ankahi lekin chintaa kii baat he
 Control of prices, increasing domestic investment, opening of new factories, providing jobs to the people, increasing the income of the common man, improving living standards are the signs by which the economy is measured
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki vartmaan main yah sab kis daur se guzar rahe hai
 Now the biggest challenge is to bring a smile on the face of the proletariat
 iske liye kya kuch kiya jayega yah ahm he
 To foster the core aspects of agricultural development, stop farmer suicides, foreign exchange earnings, boost exports and the tendency of foreign investors towards India is the mainstay of economic growth, whereas at present the situation is looking the opposite
 tippaniyan Prices of pulses have skyrocketed, keeping the excise duty almost as high as it is despite the availability of petrol at the lowest rate in the world, from wheat, rice to vegetables and fruits, edible oils, spices
 rail, hawaii or sadak parivahan main badhotaree kaa sabhi kaa bhaar janata par hi to he, jabaki logon kii tankhwaah is anupaat main doguni honi chahie
 There was also no significant increase in the rate of wages
 gharelu gruhaniyon kii chintaa badhanaa swaabhaavik he
 It is possible that the income tax limit will be increased to Rs 5 lakh, but what will benefit the common man will tell the coming budget
 bajet se aam or khaas sabhi ummiden karte hai
 Youth, housewives, senior citizens, jobbers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, service sectors are all hopeful
 bajet kaisaa hoga ye bas kayaason kaa daur hi he
 Budget will be breathtaking or Lok Lutavan, the concern of the people has just increased
 jahaan tak mahangaai kaa sawaal he, kai tarah ke taxon ke baad lagbhag sava sau sevaaon ko sarvice tex ke daayre main laakar, kamai pehle hi halki kii ja rahi he
 Meanwhile, the United Nations report says that India will be ahead in terms of economy and the rate of production growth in 2016 is 7
 3 va 2017 main 7
 Will be 5
 lekin halaat kuch or hi kah rahe hai, kya lagata he ki aisa kuch ho paaegaa? The markets are deserted
 liwali-bikwaali donon kii kami he
 Gold prices are going down
 steel sector mandi se jujh rahaa he
 The stock market is in a strange mood
 udyogon or kal kaarkaanon kii danvadol sthiti bhi chintajanak he
 From the indications about the budget, it seems that this time there can be an emphasis on increasing government expenditure, because there will be a need for money for the work of recommendations of the Pay Commission, increased pension of soldiers and capital expenditure
 lekin sawaal vahi ki paisa aayega kahaan se? In the budget, emphasis can be placed on increasing investment
 lekin maujuuda halaat main kitna kargar hoga, yah kahana jaldbaaji hogi, kyonki pichley bajet main 69500 karod rupee vinievesh kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya tha jabaki sarkaar mushkil se 12700 karod rupee hi juta pai he
 Here, the disinvestment in the loss making psus failed completely
 aay badhaane ke lihaaj se post offis ko bank main tabdeel karne kii yojana bhi faleebhoot nahin ho pai, jabaki rigerv bank iske liye license bhi de chukaa he
 The biggest challenge in the budget is to make arrangements to reduce corporate tax and move towards GST
 corporate tex main yadi 1 pratishat kii bhi kami hui to sarkari khajaane main 6 se 7 hajaar karod rupayon kii aamad ghategi
 This is definitely a big amount
 is bajet main modi sarkaar dwaara bahuprachaarit kaale dhan ko lekar bhi kathor upaay kiye ja sakate hai
 It is possible that keeping cash in excess of the limit is prohibited
 skool, collejon main donneton ke naam par kaledhan ke len-dein par roak ke liye donneton ko cross check se dena jaruri kiya jaae
 It is estimated that in MBBS admissions, about 12 thousand crore rupees of black money is used in the entire country
 pichley bajet main kalaadhan kaa khulaasa karne, khaas skim laane kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 The scheme also came, but black money did not come as expected
 mahatvakankshi sona mudrikaran yojana kaa bhi yahi haal rahaa
 The plan came but gold was missing
 yah sab beete bajet kii aadhi adhuri ghoshnaaen hai
 There is a possibility of fixing the desired salary breakup in this budget
 iske liye wo company jisamen 40 yaa adhik karmchaaree hai, tay kar sakengi ki bhavishya nidhi fund main paisa jamaa karnaa he yaa nahin evam swasthya beemaa ke liye manapansad skim bhi chunane kii aazaadee hogi
 In the current financial year, the government is lagging behind the disinvestment target
 shesh do maheenon main sthiti main sudhaar kii gunjaaish bhi nahin dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, the entire person is definitely seen falling on the common man's shoulders
 ho saktaa he, vittamantri ne pehle hi lok lubhaavan na hone vaala bajet kahkar, shaayad yahi sanket diya ho
 The finance ministry and the railway ministry are already in a face-to-face situation regarding cheap rail fares
 sasta yatri kiraaya or saste anaaj dhulaai par di jane vaali sabsidi kiski khate main jaae
 The Ministry of Railways wants the Finance Ministry to take up and the Finance Ministry is not ready
 sabsidi ko lekar is uhapoh ke bich kahin bhaar sidhe aam aadmi ke kandhon par na aa jaae? Here, understanding the gestures of 'deloitte' survey, Indian companies are also afraid of the fear of their loyal employees leaving
 karmchaaree, company main apni bhoomika ko lekar asantusht hai jisaki vajah leadership pojishan ke liye yuvaaon ko protsaahit kiya janaa bataaya gaya he
 It is indeed untold but a matter of concern
 keemton par niyantran, gharelu nivesh badhanaa, nae kal-kaarkaane khulanaa, logon ko naukariyaan milanaa, aam aadmi kii aay badhanaa, jivan str main sudhaar aana hi wo sanket hai, jinase arthvyavastha kii gati maapi jaati he
 Needless to say, what phase are all currently going through
 ab to sabase badi chunauti sarvhaara varg ke chehre par muskaan laane kii he
 What will be done for this is important
 krishi vikaas kii kori baton ko faleebhoot karnaa, kisaanon kii aatmahatya rokna, videshi mudra arjan, export ko badhaava or videshi niveshkon kaa bharat ke prati rujhaan hi aarthik tarakkee kaa mukhya aadhaar he, jabaki vartmaan main sthiti, isse ulat hi dikh rahi he
 The comments daal ke bhav aasmaan chhu rahe hai, gehun, chaaval se lekar sabji or fal, khaadya tel, masaale, duniya main sabase nunatam dar par petrol kii uplabdhta ke baavjood exise duty badhaakar keemten lagbhag jas kii tas rakhana
 The burden of increasing rail, air and road transport is all on the public, while the salary of the people should be doubled in this proportion
 mazdooree kii dar main khaas ijapha bhi nahin hua
 It is natural for the housewives to be worried
 sambhav he ki iskar kii seemaa badhaakar 5 lakh rupee tak kar di jaae, lekin isse aam aadmi ko kya phayda hoga yah aane vaala bajet hi batayega
 Everyone expects common and special budget
 yuva, gruhinee, varisht naagarik, naukareepesha, vyavsaayee, udhyami, sarvice sector sabhi to ummiden lagaae baithe hai
 What will the budget be like, it is just a period of speculation
 bajet lok lubhaavan hoga yaa lok lutaavan, logon kii chintaa abhi se bad gai he

 manch par mulaayam kii maujuudagi main unka yah sher bahut kuch kah gaya tha
 These speculations intensified when Amar Singh reached his house to meet his old 'boss' Mulayam Singh on Tuesday morning
 kayaason kaa silsilaa tab or tej ho gaya jab sapa adhyaksh ne amar singh ko gaadi main baithaaya or apane saath party daftar lekar ravaanaa ho gaye
 But immediately after this Amar Singh said that it was an informal and friendly meeting and he is not joining the SP
 unhone kaha, 'meri shivpal, mulaayam singh or akhilesh yadav teenon se naashte par alag alag lambii mulaakaat hui
 Why is the ruckus met, did not steal, did not rob and geography can be changed, not history

 Amar Singh became politically inactive for a few days

 Excerpt 1
 apane bachapan se praachaarya or kavi hone tak kii yatra ke bare main bataaie? aap apane ko sahaj kahaan paati hai – sahitya main, yaa classroom main?- bachapan se ab tak kii yatra main mahasoos kiya ki har sandarbh ko tatasth hokar dekhne kii ek drushti mere saath hi badi hui he
 i used to read a lot
 mujhe saamaanya dincharyaaon vaale jivan main bhi mahakavyatmakataa dikhti gai he
 Literature gave this rite
 jeene kaa ek bada sansar aakrisht karata he
 Something is seen in every life
 sabase bad kar ek jaddojahad
 It is always unique
 use samanyikrut nahin kiya ja saktaa
 So learn from this
 darasal mujhe sahitya classroom kaa ekstansion lagata he
 Both are very dear, really
 padhaanaa jindagi lagata he
 2
 aapaki kavitaaon kaa mul prerak tatv kya he, aap inase kya sandesh dena chaahati hai?-kavitaaon kii prerana? mujhe lagata he jindagi hi he
 He always treats him uski jatiltaayen samajhnaa chaahati hum
 a sadness is found all the time
 likh kar bhi chaiyn nahin padataa

 To some extent, this good composition is also a discouraging condition

 5

 The objective of Imran Khan is that Trump will once again open the path for financial assistance to Pakistan

 View this post on instagramsubject: # Qantas airways @qantas This should get your attention! Traveling from Sydney to Melbourne and at the check in counter met a grumpy # Mel (that's her name) who decided it was "OK" to speak curtly to "US" (brown people !!) travelling together, i was flying business and had 2 bags (my allowance) and she insisted and decided my half empty Duffel bag was oversized (to check in !!) So she sent us to check it in at the other counter dealing with "oversized luggage"
 
 there a polite lady (yes this one was) said
 
 "this ISN'T an oversized bag, pls check this in manually if u can at another counter" (all this happening while the counter is going to shut in 5 mins) As the manual check in was not going thru for 5 mins ( we tried) i went upto # Mel and requested her to put the bag thru as her colleague said it was not an oversized bag
 
 She refused again
 
 Just being adamant especially when i told her this is causing a lot of inconvenience
 
 We had no time to waste so we ran to the oversized baggage counter and requested her to put the bag through which she did after i told her that # Rude # Mel had issues !!!
 
 
 
 to which another colleague joined in an reiterated my duffle was not oversized and could easily be checked in
 The point is 
 
 This piece is only for # quantas airlines to know and take cognisance 
 
 that their staff must be taught to be helpful and TONE can’t change with preference to # COLOUR 
 "WE" are NOT # pushovers and they must know that being # callous and # Rude will NOT BE TOLERATED 🙏✋🏼💔

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, a former cricketer and a minister in the Punjab government, has seen everyone doing Sharo-shayari
 lekin yah shaayad kam hi logon ko maaloom hoga ki navjot singh siddhu subah 3:00 baje uthakar dhyaan main baithte hai or ghanton meditation karte hai
 To find out some of the untouched aspects of Navjot Singh Sidhu's life till date, correspondent Ashok Singhal spent the whole day with Navjot Singh Sidhu and tried to know how he prepared himself during the election campaign
 subah-subah siddhu se jaanane kii koshish kii gai ki siddhu ek rajaneta, ek cricketer or kamedi sho ke alaava kya-kya karte hai? jiske jawaab main kai dilachasp baaten jaanane ko mili
 Actually, Sidhu does meditation in the morning
 bina pagadi baandhe siddhu subah dhyaan karte hai
 At the same time, Sidhu can also explain well about religion and knowledge
 siddhu ne sikh dharm se lekar sikh guruon ke bare main bataaya
 He told about Mahadev to Vaishno Devi and said that i am a yogi
 siddhu kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki main subah dhyaan karne ke baad ghanton isamen kho jaataa hum or uske baad taiyaar hokar 6 falon kaa naashtaa karata hum
 Which a yogi does
 unhone kaha main ek yogi hum mujhako yogi bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Sidhu says that there was a time when he could not talk to anyone
 cricket khelte vakt match ke dauraan koi intervyuu dene se bhaagate the
 The school used to lose sweat in the name of participating in any debate in the college
 lekin ab main ghanton baat kar saktaa hum
 i do not speak by reading any book
 main koi likhakar taiyaari nahin karata hum
 All of this has been achieved by my meditation and meditation
 siddhu kaa kahana he ki main jo shero-shaayari bolta hum jo bhi main kisse kahaniyaan sunaata hum yah mujhako mere pita or mata se viraasat main mili hai or andar se sab chijen baahar aati hai tab main bol paata hum
 After meditating and having breakfast, Navjot Singh Sidhu gets ready for election campaign in this election season
 siddhu ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah jis team main hote hai, vahaan par vah visphotak pari khelte hai or unke nishane par hote hai virdohi team ke captain
 At one time when he was in BJP, Rahul Gandhi used to be a target of Sidhu
 lekin ab pradhanmantri narendra modi hi zyaadaatar unke nishane par hote hai
 Whether it is a road show, a rally, Sidhu has a different style and firstly Navjot Singh Sidhu targets Prime Minister Modi
 siddhu modi par logon se vaadakhilaphi kaa aarope lagaate hai
 He says that the promises made by PM Modi
 usamen se ek bhi puraa nahin kiya or is baar modi kii hawa nikal jaaegi

 So there is a political war going on in the Supreme Court as well
 avmaananaa maamle par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apana jawaab supreme court main daakhil kar diya he
 The Congress President has expressed regret over the statement that the watchman is a thief, but in his reply, he has also surrounded the Bharatiya Janata Party
 bhartiya janata party kii saansad minakshi lekhi dwaara congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke khilaaf court kii avmaananaa ko lekar daakhil kii gai yachika par aaj ek baar phir sunwaayee honi thi
 Earlier, Meenakshi and Rahul's side sought time to respond
 rahul ne diya javabsomvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne avmaananaa maamle main supreme court main apana jawaab daakhil kar diya
 Rahul based the old arguments and said that his motive was not to insult the Supreme Court
 haalanki, isi bahaane unhone bhartiya janata party ko gheraa or kaha ki bijepi bhi supreme court ke faisle ko rafel maamle main clin chit banaakar baahar phayda uthaa rahi he
 Rahul said in his affidavit that the petition of Meenakshi Lekhi should be dismissed with fine
 unhone kaha ki bijepi court kaa istemaal raajnneetik prachaar main ghaseet kar rahi he
 In fact, the matter related to Rafael Deal came up during the hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday
 jisapar chif justise kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki rafel par daakhil punarvichaar yachika kii sunwaayee mangalvaar ko honi he
 Meanwhile, when a matter of contempt by Rahul Gandhi came up, some time was sought to file an answer from both sides of Rahul and Meenakshi
 centre kii apil- taali jaae sunwaayeehalanki, chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha he ki vah is masale par aaj shaam ko hi sunwaayee karenge
 The central government has asked for more time for its affidavit
 court main mangalvaar ko rafel se jude masale par sunwaayee honi thi
 The Center appeals that the hearing to be held on Tuesday be deferred
 jisapar chif justise ne kaha he ki wo is sambandh main aadesh jari karenge
 Significantly, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is accused of contempt of Supreme Court order
 sarvocch adaalat main rafel maamle par punarvichaar yachika swikaarne ke baad rahul ne apane ek bayaan main kaha tha ki supreme court ne bhi sweekaar kar liya he ki chaukeedaar chor he
 After which bjp's Meenakshi Lekhi filed a petition against him
 is par rahul gandhi ko supreme court kii taraf se jhatka laga tha or unhen apane bayaan ko lekar khed prakat karnaa padaa tha
 The Supreme Court also said that he has never said so (the watchman is a thief)
 haalanki, is jawaab se bhi supreme court santusht nahin tha isliye yachikakarta kii apil par rahul gandhi ko dobaaraa apana jawaab dene ke liye kaha gaya tha
 During the last hearing, the court had also asked during the hearing, who is the watchman? lagbhag nau maheene baad srilankai team main vaapasi karne vaale ajanta mendis ne mangalvaar ko pehle match main hi aath ran dekar chah wicket lene kaa record pradarshan kiya or phir vishwa twanti- 20 championships main bhaag le rahi tiimon kaa aagaah karte hue kaha, vah aagaamee maichon main isse bhi behatar pradarshan karne kii koshish karenge
 Ajanta Mendis' charismatic bowling led Sri Lanka to a win over Zimbabwe in the opening match of the World Cup
 mendis ne duusari baar ek match main chah wicket liye
 He managed to improve his previous record (six wickets for 16 runs)
 is pradarshan ke liye unhen main of da match chunaa gaya
 The comments unhone kaha, main vastav main bahut khush hum
 i am playing cricket on behalf of the national team after nine months and am really happy with my performance
 main aagaamee maichon main bhi apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karne kii koshish karuunga
 Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene also patted his bowlers
 ajanta ke alaava ek anya spinner jivan mendis ne 24 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 Jayawardene said, playing against a team like Zimbabwe is not easy
 aap kuch bhi tay nahin maan sakate
 We had to ensure that we perform to the best of our ability
 unhone kaha, hamane acha khel dikhaaya
 Our batsmen batted well while the bowlers played a great role
 ajanta mendis kii karishmai gendbaaji ne srilanka ko vishwa cap ke udghaatan match main zimbabwe par jeet dilwaai
 Mendis took six wickets in a match for the second time
 vah khud ke pichley record ( 16 ran dekar chah wicket) main sudhaar karne main safal rahe

 Apart from Ajanta, another spinner Jeevan Mendis took three wickets for 24 runs
 jayavardhane ne kaha, zimbabwe jaisi team ke khilaaf khelnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 You can't agree on anything
 hamen yah sunishchit karnaa tha ki ham apni kshamta ke anuroop pradarshan karen
 He said, we played well

 loksabhaa chunaav jaise-jaise najadik aata ja rahaa he netaaon kii soshal media par sakriyata vaise-vaise ufaan maar rahi he
 Leaders whose social media handles had been a 'slow news' for the last four years now want to become prime time news
 ab aise main naujavaanon-navayuvatiyon kii puch badi he jo soshal media par sakriy hai yaa jinhen uski samaj he
 In this article, we have tried to catch some of the deep things related to this business: 1
 rate kya hona chahie? rate fiks nahin he-ye netaaon kii haisiyat or samajhadaari par tay he
 Like every business, demand-supply is accounted for and it also determines how compulsive or how compromised it is! 2
 chunki yah ek anishchit or alpakaaleen karm he jiskaa dirghakaalin or ghaatak asar bhi ho saktaa he-to aise main iskaa ek oparcunity cost hota he
 That is, its average rate should be at least three times that of other businesses
 haalanki ye adarsh he!3
 Four years ago a rich leader offered 30,000 / per month to a friend of mine, which included limited posts and tweets
 mujhe laga ki thik-thaak he
 4
 is saal ek netaa ne mere duusare dost ko 1 lakh ofer kiya jisamen graphic bhi shaamil he
 Limited posts, limited tweets, limited videos and limited graphics
 5
 Many leaders of up-bihar give 20 thousand per month, which shows fatal mistakes in Twitter and Facebook posts
 darasal, krishi-arthshaastra kii bhashaa main ise 'aajeevika krishi' kaha jaataa he yon aise kaam kaankl kism ke andhbhakt or kanvaare party cader kiya karte hai jinhen lagata he ki ve netaji ke saath kisi mahaan udyeshy main lage hue hai
 But this zeal loosens in a few years when a marriage takes place or a family grows
 vaise bhi, paisa kaa gunvattta se sanathan or ghanghor sambandh he
 6
 sutara bataate hai ki desh ke ek khanij sampann praant ke mukhyamantri kaa soshal media profile ek antarrarshtriya str par mashhoor kansaltency ne saal 2016 main 15 karod salanaa par liya tha
 Later a clever journalist threw that agency out at 5 crores annually! It is obvious that a team is needed for the work of a Chief Minister
 wo vyaktigat post jaisaa nahin hoga
 7
 har netaa kaa funda alag-alag hota he
 People of very old age do not understand this medium, because this medium is still in the role of Ramchandra
 noujvaan netaaon, kuch bujurg lekin maansik rup se jawan netaaon ko isaki samaj he-vahaan kisi kii baat ban sakati he
 8
 chunki yah chhavi nirmaan kaa dhandha he jisamen kisi soshal media karmi kii sari bauddhik urja lag jaati he, to iskaa rate zyada hona chahie
 It would cost a leader billions of rupees
 kii branding ko handle karne kaa kaam he
 It is not appropriate to evaluate it by the hour
 9
 In such a situation, if you want to get into this business, then negotiate
 ise laghu-theka hi samajhie
 It is still largely unorganized sector in India with rules and regulations yet to be set
 *** In Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, the police wreak havoc on the family of the policeman himself

 No candidate was listened to

 Despite the wave of nationwide popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 assembly elections, the party could not even finish second on three Mewat assembly seats - Punhana, Ferozepur Jhirka and Nuh
 lekin nauksham choudhary ko puraa bharosa he ki is baar nateeja katai alag hoga
 He said, "the common man here has understood that the BJP is forming the government in the state and at the center, and if they want representation in the development and assembly, they will have to elect the BJP
 
 
 "nauksham choudhary se congress (congress)ke mohammad eliyas (mohammad Iliyas)mukaabil hai,jinhone varsh2009main yah seat jiti thi

" ’’ During the Lok Sabha elections, the issue of broadcasting Namo TV has also come up in Parliament
 jis par sarkaar ne safai di he ki yah channel soochna evam prasaaran mantralay main listed nahin tha
 MP Balubhau Suresh Narayan Dhanorkar had asked the government on 12 July whether a TV channel called Namo TV was listed in the list of channels in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 yadi haa to iskaa byora kya he
 If not, what are the reasons for this
 aam chunaav 2019 ke dauraan ise kaise shuru kiya gaya?iskaa jawaab dete hue soochna or prasaaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne loksabhaa main 12 july ko bataaya ki namo tivi soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ke channelon kii suchi main soochibaddh nahin he
 Because it was a platform service provided by DTH operators to customers
 haalanki sarkaar kii taraf se soochna evam prasaaran mantri ne yah nahin bataaya ki aam chunaav 2019 ke dauraan iskaa prasaaran kaise shuru hua
 Let me tell you that during the Lok Sabha elections, the opposition created a ruckus on the mysterious broadcast of Namo TV
 is channel par piem modi ke bhaashan chalane par rahul gandhi samet kai netaaon ne soochna prasaaran mantralay se sawaal poochhate hue kaha tha ki aakhir niyamon ko darkinar karke is channel ke prasaaran kii anumati kis tarah di gai he
 The opposition had termed this channel as the government's propaganda machine
 us dauraan dit operators jaise ki tata ski, videokon or dish tivi ne namo tivi ko free tu air qaraar diya
 That is, consumers were not paying any money to watch this channel
 ye channel puure desh main dikh rahaa tha
 The BJP was raising the expenses controversy as the Election Commission sought a report from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 soochna prasaaran mantralay ke jawaab se vivaad or bhi bad gaya tha
 The ministry told the Election Commission that Namo TV is an 'advertising-based platform' and is being broadcast by DTH operators

 Aligarh is not taking the name of the halt on the picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in the Muslim University
 uniwarsity ke chaatro ne shanivaar raat 12 baje tak internet puri tarah band kar pradarshan kiya
 It is said that the country was divided in 1947 due to Jinnah's insistence
 aaj jinna ko lekar dilli se AMU tak bavaal machaa hua he
 He is said to have been something else three decades before the partition of India in 1947
 us jinna main desh ke liye ladane or angrejon ko bharat se hataane kaa jajba tha
 At that time, Jinnah had the passion to fight for the country and remove the British from India
 isamen congress ke jis netaa se jinna sabase zyada prabhavit the, wo the lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak the
 When revolutionaries Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki were hanged, Tilak immediately raised the demand for Swaraj in his newspaper Kesari
 is par angrejon ne tilak par rajdroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jisamen unki taraf se jinna hi vakaalat kar rahe the
 But Jinnah could not save Tilak and he was imprisoned for six years from 1908 to 1914 in Mandalay jail in Myanmar for treason
 lekin do saal baad jab angrejon ne ek baar phir jinna par rajdroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya to jinna phir se unke vakil bane or is baar unhone tilak ko bachaa bhi liya
 The seething politics over a picture of Jinnah hanging in silence for 80 years, after this, Tilak and Jinnah's relationship became so strong that Tilak Jinnah was pacted between the two in the same year
 usamen ye faisla hua ki hindu muslim ekta ke liye donon kaum puri takat jhonkenge or usee takat ke saath angrejon kaa muqabla karenge
 But this work too remained incomplete
 faisal ke chaar saal baad 1920 main tilak kii mrityu ho gai or jinna dhire dhire congress kii raajnneeti se dur hote chale gaye
 After which Jinnah became the biggest factor of partition of India
 kya he puraa maamlavivaad kii shuruyaat aligarh se bijepi saansad satish gautam ne AMU ke kulapati tarik mansoor ko likhe apane patr main vishvavidhyalay chaatrasangh ke karyaalay kii deevaaron par pakistan ke sansthaapak kii tasviir lage hone par aapatti jataai thi
 University spokesperson Shafe Kidwai defended the picture of Jinnah hanging for decades, saying that Jinnah was a founding member of the university and was given a lifetime membership of the students' union
 bataa den, hindustan main shiksha kaa ek ahm garh eemyu aajkal is nafrat kii aanch par ubal rahaa he ki jinna kii tasviir yahaan rahani chahie yaa nahin
 After Jinnah dispute over another picture in Aligarh, the students beat up the photographer! In 1936, Jinnah pulled the mental divide between Hindus and Muslims
 uske do saal baad aligarh uniwarsity kii is darodivar par ye tasviir lagi
 Only after 9 years the country got independence and this face of the picture went to Pakistan and became the Governor General
 lekin 80 saal se khamoshi main tangi is tasviir par ab phijaaen cheekhney lagi hai

 film kii maane to is mohalle main daakhil hone ke liye pehle ijazat leni padati he
 In this film, Wasseypur is shown to be dirt-ridden and littered with narrow-skinned abuses
 jabaki hakeekat ye nahin he
 It has paved roads and multi-storeyed buildings
 mohalla ganda bhi itnaa nahin he
 And the biggest thing is that the people of Wasseypur roam freely day and night
 jahaan tak baat itihaas kii he to dhanbad ke ek mashhoor builder vaase sahab ne 1956 main yahaan ke jangalon ko katkar is mohalle ke neenv rakhi thi
 Later, the name of this locality was named after him
 kehete hai ki tab is mohalle main sirf sau log basate the
 But now the population here is about one and a half lakh
 lekin film relies hone ke baad se hi ye mohalla badnaam ho gaya he
 According to a relative of Vase Saheb, because of this film, wherever he goes now people see him from the wrong point of view
 yahaan tak ki ab log vasepur main shaadi ke liye apni beti tak dene se manaa karne lage hai
 However, it is true that in the last four decades, due to the illegal trade of coal, railways and iron, there have been many deaths in mutual rivalry
 jiname namchin logon se lekar chote-chote pyaade tak shaamil he
 But now this town has left the past behind
 pehle ke mukaable ab yahaan ke logon kaa rahan-sahan badal chukaa he
 From school to college have been opened here for studies
 rojgaar or kaarobaar ke silsile main is mohalle ke bahut saare log vidasho tak main jaakar kaam kar rahe hai
 Now the question is, when Wassepur is like this then how was Gangs of Wasseypur born? So this is also the whole story darasal film main jin do kunbo ke bich ladaai kaa taana bana buna gaya he wo donon vasepur ke hi rahane vaale hai
 One of them, Faheem Khan, is currently serving a life sentence in Hazaribagh jail
 to vahiin doosraa sabir ansaari abhi haal hi main perol par jail se baahar aayaa he
 On this same rivalry of Faheem Khan and Sabir Ansari, the author named Zeeshan Qadri wrote a novel
 or usee upanyaas par ye film bani he
 Zeeshan Quadri himself is also a resident of Wasseypur
 vasepur ke isi qamar makhdooni gali main fahim or sabir kaa pushtaini makaan he
 According to the police report, many people died in the Khuni gang-war between these two neighbors
 inamen fahim kii maa, bhai or mausi kii jaane shaamil thim to vahiin duusari taraf sabir ke bhai samet uske kai rishtedaaron or pyaadon ko bhi fahim ke gurgo gaye maut ke ghat utaar diya
 But even after these massacres, the rivalry between these two families has not diminished and even today they remain thirsty for each other's blood
 haalanki duusari taraf vasepur ke aam logon kaa kahana he kii fahim khan or sabir ke bich chal rahe gangvaar main pure vasepur ko ghasita janaa galat he
 This Mohalla is being infamous due to the title of the film
 vaise shaayad vasepur ke logon ko pehle hi andaaza ho gaya tha ki film main kya dikhaaya jane vaala he
 This is the reason why despite the release of the film, not a single poster of this film was put in Wasseypur
 yahaan tak ki film kaa naam badalawaane ke liye log adaalat tak ja puhanche

 In the letter, Sushma dismissed the allegations of killing two Pakistani Rangers and said that India favors peace along the border
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne pakistani pradhanmantri ke rashtriya suraksha or videsh maamalon ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ko patr likhaa

 ajij ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bharat ne antarrashtriya seemaa par baithak ke liye bulaane ke baad do pakistani rangeron ko maar diya tha
 Rejecting Aziz's allegations, Sushma emphasized that Pakistani commanders, using high-caliber weapons in response to the Indian side's defensive firing, broadened the scope of the conflict and targeted the residential areas
 videsh mantri ne likhaa ki 31 disambar ko jammu kshetra main ghatnaayen us samay shuru huin jab biguef kaa ek niyamit gashti dal pakistani seemaa chaowkee se nishaanaa bana kar kii gai golibari kii chapet main aayaa

 sushamaa ne kaha ki jaisaa kaha ja rahaa he, bhartiya paksh ne kisi bhi charan main safed jhande ke tale platoon stareey sampark kii maang nahin kii thi
 There was a constant message from India to Pakistan that if they stop firing at the Indian border posts, then India will stop the firing immediately
 patr main kaha gaya he ki durbhaagya se pakistani cmanderon ne shaam hone tak is suzav kii andekhi kii
 It states that India has always been and will continue to follow the mechanism that was developed to ensure peace along the international border and the Line of Control
 sushamaa ne ajij se yah sunishchit karne ko kaha ki pakistani bal bhi aisa hi karen

 But on the basis of settling of migrant Hindus, the names of Bangladesh and Pakistan are also included in the top 6 countries except India where these people settled
 ek research ke anusaar, jitani hindu aabaadi bharat aati he usase kahin zyada yah aabaadi desh se baahar ja rahi he
 After India and America, Hindus have the largest population in neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan
 sabase zyada bharat se baahar gaye hindusmerica think tanks PEW ke ek aankade ke mutabik kareeb 37 lakh hindu aabaadi bharat ai
 While 53 lakh Hindu population migrated to other places outside the country, the most surprising is that most of the Hindu population going out of India went to Bangladesh, Nepal or Pakistan
 pravasi hinduon ke basane ke hisaab se dekha jaae to bharat main 3,660,000 log based, iske baad america main 1,340,000 to bangladesh or nepal main 750,000-750,000 hindu jaakar based
 After this comes the number of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan, England, Canada and Sri Lanka where Hindus settled
 agar hindu aabaadi ko duusare deshon main jaakar basane ke dar par najar daali jaae to bharat ke hindu sabase zyada duusare deshon main jaakar basate hai
 53,30,000 Indian Hindus migrated to another country
 bharat ke baad is maamle main bangladesh kaa number aata he
 From Bangladesh, 27 lakh 60 thousand Hindus settled in other countries
 is maamle main bangladesh ke baad pakistan kaa number he jahaan se 8 lakh hindu duusare desh gaye
 Nepal is in the fourth position in this case, from where 7 lakh 20 thousand Hindus have left their country and settled in another country

 It is also being considered that on cancellation of the premium train ticket, the passenger will also get some amount back
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki nae kiraaya system ke tahat premium trainon ko isi saal july se shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 The newspaper quoted a senior Indian Railways official as saying that the entire model of the karasystem of premium trains is being changed
 iske tahat ab maang badhane ke saath jatke main kiraaya nahin badhaayaa jayega, balki slab system taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Under this, only after the scheduled seats of a class of trains are booked, there will be a fixed increase in the fare of that class
 is tarah se kiraye badhaane ke liye slab honge or is tarah se har slab ke baad kiraye main kuch fisadi kii badhotaree hogi
 It is to be noted that premium trains were introduced in the last year of the UPA government and a dynamic fare system was implemented like airplanes
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki ek saath das se bees tikat book hote hi train ke kiraye main jabardast oochaal aa jaataa tha
 Not only this, the fares of premium trains were often increased by 200 to 300 per cent
 chunki premium trainon kaa model aisa tha ki demand ke saath kiraaya badhata tha, aise main kai baar aisa bhi hota tha ki demand badhane par third asi kaa kiraaya second asi ke kiraye se bhi bad jaataa tha

 yun latakta chalaa gaya maamlasaal 1997 main aay se adhik sampatti jutaney kaa maamla khul gaya tha
 The first problem in this was that the Chief Sessions Judge of Tamil Nadu said that he had a pile of cases and additional special courts should be set up to investigate the cases against the leaders

 But Jayalalithaa and her colleagues challenged their formation and their ability to hear the case

 abhiyojan paksh ko jhatka isliye laga ki landan hotels kaa maamla itnaa pukhta nahin tha or donon maamle main alag-alag len-dein hua tha
 In August 2005, the Supreme Court stayed the process of combining the two cases
 yah roak paanch saal tak ke liye thi

 Apart from this, the Director of Basic Education has sent a proposal for the policy of adjustment and promotion of teachers at the district level to the government
 is sambandh main sheeghra hi shasnadesh jari kiya jayega
 The Director of Basic Education, in a proposal sent to the government, said that the cadre of council teachers is at the district level and inter-district transfer is not necessary under the annual arrangement
 yah keval shikshakon ko suvidha dene ke liye he
 Therefore, it would be appropriate to give inter-state transfers to teachers only on the recommendation of the BSA, if necessary
 vahiin duusari ore parishadiy skulon main har saal shikshakon kaa hone vaala samaayojan bhi is saal nahin kiya jayega
 According to the proposal sent to the government, the process of recruitment of teachers is currently underway at four levels

 In such a situation, no adjustment of teachers will be required

 After the approval of the Secretary, such teachers will be accommodated in schools in need

 - inupat IANS India has two Prime Ministers
 ek hindi bolne vaale pradhanmantri shri narendra modi or duusare angrezi bolne vaale mistar prime ministar narendra modi
 One who speaks Hindi in the village and the other who speaks English in international gatherings
 hamaare desh main bhashaa ke vikaas or vistaar main sahityakaron, filmkaaron or patrakaron kii charchaa to hoti he lekin netaaon ke yogadan kii kam charchaa hoti he
 The Prime Minister also represents the language
 samay samay par is aadhaar par bhi moolyakan hona chahie
 Both the Prime Ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party have been completely capable leaders, despite being quite different from each other in terms of language
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii hindi narendra modi kii hindi se kahin zyaada samrudh he lekin vaajapeyi ji kii hindi kuleenata or saahitiyikta se bandhi he
 Vajpayee's Hindi as leader of the opposition was also bound by dignity and accountability and remained the same even after becoming the Prime Minister
 vah hindi bolte vakt netaa bhi hote the or kavi bhi
 He had many types of Hindi
 gandhinagar ke saansad laal krishna adwani kii hindi acchhee thi lekin vaajapeyi kii hindi ke saamne unki hindi kii kam charchaa ho saki
 Advani lacks credibility and naturalness in Hindi
 vah acchhee hindi bolte to he lekin tatsam or tadbhav ke bich talmail nahin bitha sake
 He is like a Swayamsevak of Hindi Sangh who is made with a special type of artificial training
 sangh ke kai netaaon kii hindi adwani se milti julati he
 Advani made more than his stature less than language
 vah angreji bolte vakt bhi vyaktigat haisiyat ke moh se aage nahin nikal pate hai
 Vajpayee was also a volunteer but his Hindi is not from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii hindi apane in donon varishton se kaaphi alag he
 Within Gujarat he used to hold meetings in Gujarati
 baarah saal tak unhone khud ko gujarati bolne vaale netaa kii tarah pesh kiya
 Six crore Gujarati Asmita's claim could not be obtained from Hindi
 2013 ke saal main jab dilli kii daavedaari karne lage tab unki hindi bahut kaam ai lekin style vahi rahi jo gujarati main thi
 There was a continuity of ghazab in two different languages from voice to howl expressions
 loksabhaa chunaavon main kahin kahin vah atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa haav-bhav bhi lete dikhe
 Modi's speech should be written separately on the issue of factual mistakes, arguments, political manipulation and inclusion of communities, he does not fail to speak wrongly
 janata unke bhaashan style par mohit rahati he isliye virodhiyon kii tarah tathyon kii kam jaanch karti he! vaise virdohi bhi thik se nahin karte
 At the national level, Hindi was weakened by Vajpayee's departure
 pi ve narsimha raav or manmohan singh kai bhashaaon ke vidwaan rahe lekin donon ne na to vaqta ke rup main pahchaan banaai na hi kisi ek bhashaa ko pahchaan di
 Sonia Gandhi's Hindi in this matter was commendable
 unki hindi main ek chaah thi, logon ne unki koshish ko saraahaa or do baar satta di
 She used to read by writing but in terms of speaking she overshadows all the leaders of her party
 unamem panch line paidaa karne kaa bodh nafis hindi or urdu bolne vaale salmaan khurshid jaise netaaon se kahin behatar he
 By the way, Salman seems to be a very simple and ineffective leader while speaking cheerfully
 congress netaaon kii bhashaa par alag se likhuunga
 After Vajpayee, many Hindi-speaking leaders were in regional parties, but they also have their limitations in Hindi
 haalanki unamem se kai hindi ke swabhimaan yaa angrezi ke virodh se paidaa hue netaa rahe
 Right now i do not want to discuss them in detail
 bas itnaa kahana chahta hoon ki unamem taatkalikta, swaabhaaviktaa, kalpanashiltaa or tatparta nahin thi
 He remained a leader on the basis of his social base less than his language
 bhashashastriyon ko is baat kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie ki kya 2011-2012 ke saal main arvind kejariwal kii hindi kii aakraamakata ne narendra modi ko prabhavit kiya yaa donon ke bich kisi kism kii bhashaai pratispardhaa hui ki ek hi tarah se chikh kar bolnaa, lalkaarna or hunkaar bharna he
 While Kejriwal's Hindi was defying power, Modi's Hindi started demolishing symbols of power
 unhone khud ko rashtriya str par sthapit karne ke liye hindi kaa sahaara liya or hindi bolne vaale ko bharosa diya ki udaarikaran ke is daur main jab angreji bolnaa swaabhaavik maan liya gaya he vah ab bhi hindi se chunauti de sakate hai
 The Hindi-speaking English is full of frustration to dominate the English, which sometimes considers self-respect and sometimes as nationalism
 saal 2014 main pradhanmantri kii hindi ne lutian dilli ke bhashaai kulinon ko daraa diya
 Those who did not want to accept this fear started calling Modi an outsider even though this is not completely true
 modi dilli se hi gujarat gaye the lekin laute to bahari ho gaye ! chunavi reliyon main unka bhaashan lanbaa hone laga
 People started noticing his Hindi till late
 udaarikaran se paidaa hua hindi kaa kuleen unki hindi ke zariye aatmavishvaas paane laga jo upie kii angrejiyat se dab gaya tha
 As soon as he became Prime Minister, everyone felt that Delhi would now speak Hindi
 bahut had tak aisa he bhi lekin dilli ab bhi angrezi main hi baat karti he
 When the power of Delhi becomes old then it becomes English
 nai hoti he to hindi lagati he 
 The elections in Delhi and Bihar are important for the Prime Minister's Hindi
 donon jagahon main unki hindi unke kilaaf kaam kar gai
 People in Delhi saw that there is no humility and in Bihar people started saying that the Prime Minister has no dignity
 in do chunaavon main maine usee janata ko unki bhashaa kii copy check karte dekha jo bina dekhe number diye ja rahi thi
 People began to find his decency in Hindi
 haalanki chunavi reliyon main unki hindi ab bhi waisi hi he jaisi loksabhaa chunaavon main thi
 The bus crowd should be good
 sarkari kaaryakramon main ve hindi bolte vakt khyaal rakhte hai ki pradhanmantri hai lekin bich bich main netaa kii tarah bol jate hai jaise mithai khaanaa band kar diya he ! sansad main unki hindi par phir kabhi alag se likhuungaa
 It is not that the Prime Minister does not speak Hindi while traveling abroad, but there speak two types of Hindi
 ek jab vah bhartiya mul ke samudaay ko sambodhit karte hai or doosraa jab vah kisi raashtra pramukh ke sarkari awaas yaa daftar se media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab hindi main dete hai
 At that time, his Hindi is not like that of Narendra Modi who roars in rallies but as soon as a stadium is found they forget the difference between Madison and Mokama
 satta kii hindi se azaad ho jate hai
 We know the English power but we talk less on the Indian power
 ab aata hum mistar prime ministar narendra modi par jo videshon main angrezi bolte hai
 The Prime Minister knows English, yet he reads the speech written in English
 mistar modi ne khud ko angreji bhashi netaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye technology kaa sahaara liya he
 There is a transparent plank in front of them, on which they speak by looking at it
 ek vaakya daayen mud kar bolte hai to agle vaakya ke liye baayen mud jate hai
 He is quite different from the Hindi-speaking Modi who speaks English
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi ke bheetar angrezi bolne kii athaah chaah he
 He is a multilingual leader
 gujarati, hindi or angrezi main taqariren karte hai
 These days, Ghalib and Sufi have also started working on the penance of saints! But when he speaks English, technology binds him
 aisa lagata he haath main nayaa nayaa yphone aayaa ho
 His body language shrinks while speaking English
 jaise kisi dhoti kurte vaale ko pehali baar tite prince suut pahana diya gaya ho
 There is no moving where you stand
 bade manch kii choti si jagah kaa istamaal karte hai or bhaashan ke zariye khud ko bada karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 He spoke in Hindi in the United Nations and in English in front of the American Congress
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi har samay hindi ke swabhimaan ko nahin dhonaa chaahate
 For them, Hindi is also an opportunity and English too
 vah hindi ke un roodhiwaadee pratikon ko nahin dhonaa chaahate ki videsh gaye to hindi bol kar aa gaye
 As soon as he entered the US Congress, he started shaking hands with mps
 ek pal main unke haav-bhav par angreziyat haaavee ho gai
 The language of becoming a 'cool' leader is or may be in Hindi, but the language and body language of Mr
 Modi adopts 'coolattva' (cool is the English word) of other languages
 mistar modi aseem mahatvakankshaon se bhare netaa hai
 Despite being extremely private, he shares the franchise of his ambitions among his supporters! vah bhale hi nehru virdohi hon lekin angrezi main bolte hue vah nehru ke bhaashanon kii oonchai ko chhu lenaa chaahate hai
 His jacket, which is called Modi Jacket, was called Nehru Jacket in the modern Indian politics
 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
 Do you also find any difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi? bhartiya janata party ke donon pradhanmantri bhashaa ke lihaaz se ek duusare se kaaphi alag hote hue bhi purna rup se sakasham netaa rahe hai
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Hindi is much richer than Narendra Modi's Hindi but Vajpayee's Hindi is tied to nobility and literacy
 vaajapeyi kii hindi vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par bhi maryaada or javabdehi se bandhi hoti thi or pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi waisi hi rahi
 He was also a leader and a poet while speaking Hindi
 unke paas kai tarah kii hindi thi
 Gandhinagar MP Lal Krishna Advani's Hindi was good, but Vajpayee's Hindi was less discussed in front of him
 adwani kii hindi main vishwasaneeyata or swaabhaaviktaa kaa abhaav he
 He speaks good Hindi but could not strike a synergy between Tatasam and Tadbhav
 unki hindi sangh ke swayamsevak kii tarah he jo ek khaas kism ke kritrim prashikshan se banati he
 Hindi of many Sangh leaders is similar to Advani
 adwani ne bhashaa se kam apane kad se zyaada pahchaan banaai
 Even when he speaks English, he is not able to get ahead of the fascination of personal status
 vaajapeyi bhi swayamsevak the lekin unki hindi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii nahin he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindi is very different from his two seniors
 gujarat ke bheetar ve gujarati main sabhaayen karte the
 For twelve years he projected himself as a Gujarati-speaking leader
 chah karod gujarati asmita kii daavedaari hindi se nahin mil sakati thi 
 In the year 2013, when he started claiming Delhi, his Hindi work was very useful but the style remained the same as it was in Gujarati
 do alag bhashaaon main awaz se lekar haav bhav tak gazab kii nirantarata dikhi
 In the Lok Sabha elections, he was also seen taking the attitude of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 modi ke bhaashan main tathyaatmak galatiyon, tark-kutark, raajnneetik chalbaasiyon or samudaayon ke samavesikaran ke masale par alag se likhaa janaa chahie, vah galat bolne se nahin chookte
 The public is fascinated by his style of speech, so he examines the facts less like opponents! By the way, even opponents do not do it properly
 vaajapeyi ke napathy main chale jane se rashtriya str par hindi kamazor pad gai thi
 PV Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh were scholars of many languages but both neither identified as Waqt nor recognized any one language
 is maamle main sonia gandhi kii hindi saraahneey rahi
 He had a desire in Hindi, people appreciated his efforts and gave him power twice
 vah likhakar padhati thi lekin bolne ke andaaz main vah apni party ke tamaam netaaon par baari pad jaati hai
 The feeling of creating a punch line in them is much better than leaders like Salman Khurshid, who speaks Hindi and Urdu
 vaise salmaan kurshid bolte hue behad saadhaaran or prabhaavaheen netaa lagate he
 i will write separately on the language of Congress leaders
 vaajapeyi ke baad hindi bolne vaale kai netaa kshetreey dalon main the lekin unki hindi kii bhi apni simaaen raheen hai
 However, many of them were leaders born of self-respect of Hindi or opposition to English
 abhi un par bhi vistaar se charchaa nahin karnaa chahta
 Just want to say that there was no urgency, naturalness, imagination and readiness in them
 ve apni bhashaa se kam apane saamaajik aadhaar ke dam par netaa rahe
 Linguists should study whether Arvind Kejriwal's Hindi aggression in the year 2011-2012 influenced Narendra Modi or that there was some kind of linguistic competition between the two that in the same way shouting, shouting and shouting Has to be filled
 kejariwal kii hindi, satta ko lalkaar rahi thi to modi kii hindi ne satta ke pratikon ko dhahaana shuru kar diya
 He resorted to Hindi to establish himself at the national level and assured the Hindi speakers that in this era of liberalization, when it is considered natural to speak English, he can still challenge with Hindi
 hindi bolne vaala angrezi par varchasv qaayam karne kii kuntha se bharaa rahata he jise kabhi swabhimaan to kabhi rashtrawaad ke rup main samajhataa he
 In 2014, the Prime Minister's Hindi frightened the linguistic elites of Lutyens' Delhi
 jo is dar ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chaahate the, ve modi ko bahari kehane lage jabaki yah baat puri tarah satya nahin he
 Modi had gone to Gujarat from Delhi but returned when he was outsider! His speech at election rallies began to be prolonged
 log der tak unki hindi ko notice karne lage
 The aristocracy of Hindi born out of liberalization started gaining confidence through their Hindi which was subdued by the British of UPA
 pradhanmantri banate hi sabko laga ki dilli ab hindi bolegi
 This is so to a large extent, but Delhi still speaks in English
 dilli kii satta puraani hoti he to angreji ho jaati he
 If it is new, it looks like Hindi
 dilli or bihar ke chunaav pradhanmantri kii hindi ke lihaaz se mahatvapurn hai
 In both places, his Hindi worked against him
 dilli main logon ne dekha ki vinamrata nahin he or bihar main log kehane lage ki pradhanmantri kii garima nahin he
 In these two elections, i saw the same people checking the copy of their language, who were being given numbers without seeing it
 log unki hindi main shaleenta khojane lage
 However, his Hindi in election rallies is still the same as it was in Lok Sabha elections
 bas bheed acchhee honi chahie
 While speaking Hindi in government programs, he takes care that he is the Prime Minister but in the middle he speaks like a leader as if sweets have stopped eating! i will again write separately on his Hindi in Parliament
 aisa nahin he ki videsh daure par pradhanmantri hindi nahin bolte lekin vahaan do prakaar kii hindi bolte hai
 One is when he addresses a community of Indian origin and the other when he answers media queries from the official residence or office of a nation's head in Hindi
 us vakt unki hindi us narendra modi ke jaisi nahin hoti jo reliyon main dahaadte hai lekin jaise hi koi stadium miltaa he ve medicin or mokama ke fark ko bhul jate hai
 They are free from the power of Hindi
 satta kii angreziyat to ham jaanate hai lekin satta kii hindiyat par kam baat karte hai 
 Now i come to Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi who speaks English abroad
 pradhanmantri ko angrezi aati he phir bhi vah angrezi main likhaa bhaashan padhate hai
 Mr
 Modi has used technology to establish himself as an English-speaking leader
 unke saamne ek paardarshee takhti lagi hoti he jis par likhaa dekhakar wo bolte hai
 If you speak a sentence with a right, then you turn to the left for the next sentence
 ve angrezi bolte hue hindi vaale modi se kaaphi alag ho jate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a great desire to speak English
 ve bahubhashi netaa hai
 Gujarati, Hindi and English are contested
 in dinon gaalib or sufi santon ke qalaam par bhi mehnat karne lage hai! lekin jab vah angreji bolte hai to technology unhen baandh detii he
 Looks like a new iphone has arrived
 angreji bolte vakt unki dehbhasha sikud jaati he
 Like when a dhoti kurta is worn for the first time in a tight Prince suit
 jahaan khadey hote hai vahaan se hilte dulte nahin
 They use the small space of the big stage and try to enlarge themselves through speech
 vah sanyukt raashtra sangh main hindi main bole or amareeki congress ke saamne angrezi main
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to carry the pride of Hindi all the time
 unke liye hindi bhi ek avasar he or angrezi bhi
 He does not want to carry those orthodox symbols of Hindi that if he goes abroad, he comes by speaking Hindi
 amareeki congress main ghuste hi vah saansadon se haath milaane lage
 In an instant, the British dominated their attitude
 'kool' netaa banane kii dehbhasha hindi main bhi he yaa ho sakati he lekin mistar modi kii bhashaa or dehbhasha duusari bhashaaon ke 'kooltv' ( kool angrezi shabd he) ko apana leti he
 Mr
 Modi is a leader full of immense ambitions
 nitant nijee hone ke baad bhi vah apni mahatvakankshaon kii frenchizi apane samarthakon main baant dete hai! He may be anti-nehru but speaking in English, he wants to touch the height of Nehru's speeches
 unke jis jacket ko modi jacket kaha jaataa he vah aadhunik bhartiya raajnneeti ke aadikaal main nehru jacket hi kehalaata tha
 Modi wants the country and the world to see him as a Statesman
 afghanistan or amareeki congress main diya gaya unka bhaashan bhale hi unka na likhaa ho lekin kisi bhi paimaane se stareey tha
 He was going to touch the stage he wants
 mistar prime ministar modi angrezi ko angrezi kii tarah nahin bolte
 While speaking English, he is free from the discomfort of acquiring the accents that everyone nowadays suffers from
 vah apni angrezi se sunne vaale ko 'elionet' yani alag-thalag nahin karte hai
 But it felt a bit like he wanted to be 'accepted' in English! Is also natural
 vaise hindi main hota to is bhaashan kii gaanv gaanv main charchaa hoti lekin america or duniya main asar nahin hota
 In the US Congress, he did not want to go beyond the Prime Minister or Prime Minister 
 chale bhi gaye
 In Hindi speaking houses there is no difference from English, but style English seems to indicate that the boy is gone
 bhale hi vah kitna hi kaam vaala ho 
 Mr
 Modi speaks English like Hindi
 thode sikude sikude se sarkaar nazar aate hai lekin sanbhal sanbhal kar apni baat kah jate hai
 Even if there is no naturalness, but there is seriousness
 ve angrezi par apni chhap chhod rahe hai
 His team seems to have good people writing English
 thodaa itihaas kii behatar samaj vaale log bhi hone chahie jo konark mandir ke kaal ko galat na likhe or apane netaa kii jagahansai na karaayen
 Prime Minister Modi should form a team of historians called Lefts! amareeki congress main unka bhaashan kootnithik lihaaz se bharat kii videsh niti ko america ke saamne aabhaar-niti ke rup main prakat karata he to bharat ke liye swatantra rekhaaen bhi khinchataa he
 He knows the art of preserving his natural freedom
 isliye angrezi bol rahe the lekin is baat se bephikr rahe ki mesachusets jaise mushkil uccharan ko kaise saadhaa jaae
 Just moved ahead by speaking
 har lafz or vaakya ko gambhirtha dene kaa prayaas kiya
 Manmohan Singh's speech at the US Congress was good, but Mr Prime Minister Modi made his speech memorable with his typical English speech more than his Nafees English speech
 angreziyat bhi desi or theth ho sakati he
 If you are not smitten, then the listeners remain tight! bharat-amareeki sambandhon ke pench bhaashanon se deele nahin honge
 America is basically a merchant country
 bharat prayasarat he ek vyapaaree desh main tabdeel hone ke liye
 It will talk about culture and culture, but its business policies are becoming aggressive
 prakruti kii puja kii baat hogi lekin uske dohan kii nishthurata bhi dikh jaaegi, agar koi dekhnaa chaahe to
 India is now a partner country of USA
 america bharat ke madhyamvargeey nagarikon kii mahatvakanksha he or ab rashtriya mahatvakanksha main badal rahaa he
 We are using it or they will continue to share this scholar of ours
 meraa maqasad sirf itnaa tha ki pradhanmantri kii bhashaa or style ko rekhaankit kiya jaae
 Their thought flow should be understood based on the external form of language
 kya aapako bhi pradhanmantri shri narendra modi or mistar prime ministar narendra modi main koi fark lagata he? Gandhinagar MP Lal Krishna Advani's Hindi was good, but Vajpayee's Hindi was less discussed in front of him

 Modi had gone to Gujarat from Delhi but returned when he was outsider! His speech at election rallies began to be prolonged
 log der tak unki hindi ko notice karne lage
 The aristocracy of Hindi born out of liberalization started gaining confidence through their Hindi which was subdued by the British of UPA
 pradhanmantri banate hi sabko laga ki dilli ab hindi bolegi
 This is so to a large extent, but Delhi still speaks in English
 dilli kii satta puraani hoti he to angreji ho jaati he
 If it is new, it looks like Hindi
 dilli or bihar ke chunaav pradhanmantri kii hindi ke lihaaz se mahatvapurn hai
 In both places, his Hindi worked against him
 dilli main logon ne dekha ki vinamrata nahin he or bihar main log kehane lage ki pradhanmantri kii garima nahin he
 In these two elections, i saw the same people checking the copy of their language, who were being given numbers without seeing it
 log unki hindi main shaleenta khojane lage
 However, his Hindi in election rallies is still the same as it was in Lok Sabha elections
 bas bheed acchhee honi chahie
 While speaking Hindi in government programs, he takes care that he is the Prime Minister but in the middle he speaks like a leader as if sweets have stopped eating! i will again write separately on his Hindi in Parliament
 aisa nahin he ki videsh daure par pradhanmantri hindi nahin bolte lekin vahaan do prakaar kii hindi bolte hai
 One is when he addresses a community of Indian origin and the other when he answers media queries from the official residence or office of a nation's head in Hindi
 us vakt unki hindi us narendra modi ke jaisi nahin hoti jo reliyon main dahaadte hai lekin jaise hi koi stadium miltaa he ve medicin or mokama ke fark ko bhul jate hai
 They are free from the power of Hindi
 satta kii angreziyat to ham jaanate hai lekin satta kii hindiyat par kam baat karte hai 
 Now i come to Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi who speaks English abroad
 pradhanmantri ko angrezi aati he phir bhi vah angrezi main likhaa bhaashan padhate hai
 Mr
 Modi has used technology to establish himself as an English-speaking leader
 unke saamne ek paardarshee takhti lagi hoti he jis par likhaa dekhakar wo bolte hai
 If you speak a sentence with a right, then you turn to the left for the next sentence
 ve angrezi bolte hue hindi vaale modi se kaaphi alag ho jate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a great desire to speak English
 ve bahubhashi netaa hai
 Gujarati, Hindi and English are contested
 in dinon gaalib or sufi santon ke qalaam par bhi mehnat karne lage hai! lekin jab vah angreji bolte hai to technology unhen baandh detii he
 Looks like a new iphone has arrived
 angreji bolte vakt unki dehbhasha sikud jaati he
 Like when a dhoti kurta is worn for the first time in a tight Prince suit
 jahaan khadey hote hai vahaan se hilte dulte nahin
 They use the small space of the big stage and try to enlarge themselves through speech
 vah sanyukt raashtra sangh main hindi main bole or amareeki congress ke saamne angrezi main
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to carry the pride of Hindi all the time
 unke liye hindi bhi ek avasar he or angrezi bhi
 He does not want to carry those orthodox symbols of Hindi that if he goes abroad, he comes by speaking Hindi
 amareeki congress main ghuste hi vah saansadon se haath milaane lage
 In an instant, the British dominated their attitude
 'kool' netaa banane kii dehbhasha hindi main bhi he yaa ho sakati he lekin mistar modi kii bhashaa or dehbhasha duusari bhashaaon ke 'kooltv' ( kool angrezi shabd he) ko apana leti he
 Mr
 Modi is a leader full of immense ambitions
 nitant nijee hone ke baad bhi vah apni mahatvakankshaon kii frenchizi apane samarthakon main baant dete hai! He may be anti-nehru but speaking in English, he wants to touch the height of Nehru's speeches
 unke jis jacket ko modi jacket kaha jaataa he vah aadhunik bhartiya raajnneeti ke aadikaal main nehru jacket hi kehalaata tha
 Modi wants the country and the world to see him as a Statesman
 afghanistan or amareeki congress main diya gaya unka bhaashan bhale hi unka na likhaa ho lekin kisi bhi paimaane se stareey tha
 He was going to touch the stage he wants
 mistar prime ministar modi angrezi ko angrezi kii tarah nahin bolte
 While speaking English, he is free from the discomfort of acquiring the accents that everyone nowadays suffers from
 vah apni angrezi se sunne vaale ko 'elionet' yani alag-thalag nahin karte hai
 But it felt a bit like he wanted to be 'accepted' in English! Is also natural
 vaise hindi main hota to is bhaashan kii gaanv gaanv main charchaa hoti lekin america or duniya main asar nahin hota
 In the US Congress, he wanted to go beyond the Prime Minister or Prime Minister
 chale bhi gaye
 In Hindi speaking houses there is no difference from English, but style English seems to indicate that the boy is gone
 bhale hi vah kitna hi kaam vaala ho 
 Mr
 Modi speaks English like Hindi
 thode sikude sikude se sarkaar nazar aate hai lekin sanbhal sanbhal kar apni baat kah jate hai
 Even if there is no naturalness, but there is seriousness
 ve angrezi par apni chhap chhod rahe hai
 His team seems to have good people writing English
 thodaa itihaas kii behatar samaj vaale log bhi hone chahie jo konark mandir ke kaal ko galat na likhe or apane netaa kii jagahansai na karaayen
 Prime Minister Modi should form a team of historians called Lefts! amareeki congress main unka bhaashan kootnithik lihaaz se bharat kii videsh niti ko america ke saamne aabhaar-niti ke rup main prakat karata he to bharat ke liye swatantra rekhaaen bhi khinchataa he
 He knows the art of preserving his natural freedom
 isliye angrezi bol rahe the lekin is baat se bephikr rahe ki mesachusets jaise mushkil uccharan ko kaise saadhaa jaae
 Just moved ahead by speaking
 har lafz or vaakya ko gambhirtha dene kaa prayaas kiya
 Manmohan Singh's speech at the US Congress was good, but Mr Prime Minister Modi made his speech memorable with his typical English speech more than his Nafees English speech
 angreziyat bhi desi or theth ho sakati he
 If you are not smitten, then the listeners remain tight! bharat-amareeki sambandhon ke pench bhaashanon se deele nahin honge
 America is basically a merchant country
 bharat prayasarat he ek vyapaaree desh main tabdeel hone ke liye
 It will talk about culture and culture, but its business policies are becoming aggressive
 prakruti kii puja kii baat hogi lekin uske dohan kii nishthurata bhi dikh jaaegi, agar koi dekhnaa chaahe to
 India is now a partner country of USA
 america bharat ke madhyamvargeey nagarikon kii mahatvakanksha he or ab rashtriya mahatvakanksha main badal rahaa he
 We are using it or they will continue to share this scholar of ours
 meraa maqasad sirf itnaa tha ki pradhanmantri kii bhashaa or style ko rekhaankit kiya jaae
 Their thought flow should be understood based on the external form of language
 kya aapako bhi pradhanmantri shri narendra modi or mistar prime ministar narendra modi main koi fark lagata he? At the national level, Hindi was weakened by Vajpayee's departure
 pi ve narsimha raav or manmohan singh kai bhashaaon ke vidwaan rahe lekin donon ne na to vaqta ke rup main pahchaan banaai na hi kisi ek bhashaa ko pahchaan di
 Sonia Gandhi's Hindi in this matter was commendable
 unki hindi main ek chaah thi, logon ne unki koshish ko saraahaa or do baar satta di
 She used to read by writing but in terms of speaking she overshadows all the leaders of her party
 unamem panch line paidaa karne kaa bodh nafis hindi or urdu bolne vaale salmaan khurshid jaise netaaon se kahin behatar he
 By the way, Salman seems to be a very simple and ineffective leader while speaking cheerfully
 congress netaaon kii bhashaa par alag se likhuunga
 After Vajpayee, many Hindi-speaking leaders were in regional parties, but they also have their limitations in Hindi
 haalanki unamem se kai hindi ke swabhimaan yaa angrezi ke virodh se paidaa hue netaa rahe
 Right now i do not want to discuss them in detail
 bas itnaa kahana chahta hoon ki unamem taatkalikta, swaabhaaviktaa, kalpanashiltaa or tatparta nahin thi
 He remained a leader on the basis of his social base less than his language
 bhashashastriyon ko is baat kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie ki kya 2011-2012 ke saal main arvind kejariwal kii hindi kii aakraamakata ne narendra modi ko prabhavit kiya yaa donon ke bich kisi kism kii bhashaai pratispardhaa hui ki ek hi tarah se chikh kar bolnaa, lalkaarna or hunkaar bharna he
 While Kejriwal's Hindi was defying power, Modi's Hindi started demolishing symbols of power
 unhone khud ko rashtriya str par sthapit karne ke liye hindi kaa sahaara liya or hindi bolne vaale ko bharosa diya ki udaarikaran ke is daur main jab angreji bolnaa swaabhaavik maan liya gaya he vah ab bhi hindi se chunauti de sakate hai
 The Hindi-speaking English is full of frustration to dominate the English, which sometimes considers self-respect and sometimes as nationalism
 saal 2014 main pradhanmantri kii hindi ne lutian dilli ke bhashaai kulinon ko daraa diya
 Those who did not want to accept this fear started calling Modi an outsider even though this is not completely true
 modi dilli se hi gujarat gaye the lekin laute to bahari ho gaye ! chunavi reliyon main unka bhaashan lanbaa hone laga
 People started noticing his Hindi till late
 udaarikaran se paidaa hua hindi kaa kuleen unki hindi ke zariye aatmavishvaas paane laga jo upie kii angrejiyat se dab gaya tha
 As soon as he became Prime Minister, everyone felt that Delhi would now speak Hindi
 bahut had tak aisa he bhi lekin dilli ab bhi angrezi main hi baat karti he
 When the power of Delhi becomes old then it becomes English
 nai hoti he to hindi lagati he 
 The elections in Delhi and Bihar are important for the Prime Minister's Hindi
 donon jagahon main unki hindi unke kilaaf kaam kar gai
 People in Delhi saw that there is no humility and in Bihar people started saying that the Prime Minister has no dignity
 in do chunaavon main maine usee janata ko unki bhashaa kii copy check karte dekha jo bina dekhe number diye ja rahi thi
 People began to find his decency in Hindi
 haalanki chunavi reliyon main unki hindi ab bhi waisi hi he jaisi loksabhaa chunaavon main thi
 The bus crowd should be good
 sarkari kaaryakramon main ve hindi bolte vakt khyaal rakhte hai ki pradhanmantri hai lekin bich bich main netaa kii tarah bol jate hai jaise mithai khaanaa band kar diya he ! sansad main unki hindi par phir kabhi alag se likhuungaa
 It is not that the Prime Minister does not speak Hindi while traveling abroad, but there speak two types of Hindi
 ek jab vah bhartiya mul ke samudaay ko sambodhit karte hai or doosraa jab vah kisi raashtra pramukh ke sarkari awaas yaa daftar se media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab hindi main dete hai
 At that time, his Hindi is not like that of Narendra Modi who roars in rallies but as soon as a stadium is found they forget the difference between Madison and Mokama
 satta kii hindi se azaad ho jate hai
 We know the English power but we talk less on the Indian power
 ab aata hum mistar prime ministar narendra modi par jo videshon main angrezi bolte hai
 The Prime Minister knows English, yet he reads the speech written in English
 mistar modi ne khud ko angreji bhashi netaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye technology kaa sahaara liya he
 There is a transparent plank in front of them, on which they speak by looking at it
 ek vaakya daayen mud kar bolte hai to agle vaakya ke liye baayen mud jate hai
 He is quite different from the Hindi-speaking Modi who speaks English
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi ke bheetar angrezi bolne kii athaah chaah he
 He is a multilingual leader
 gujarati, hindi or angrezi main taqariren karte hai
 These days, Ghalib and Sufi have also started working on the penance of saints! But when he speaks English, technology binds him
 aisa lagata he haath main nayaa nayaa yphone aayaa ho
 His body language shrinks while speaking English
 jaise kisi dhoti kurte vaale ko pehali baar tite prince suut pahana diya gaya ho
 There is no moving where you stand
 bade manch kii choti si jagah kaa istamaal karte hai or bhaashan ke zariye khud ko bada karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 He spoke in Hindi in the United Nations and in English in front of the American Congress
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi har samay hindi ke swabhimaan ko nahin dhonaa chaahate
 For them, Hindi is also an opportunity and English too
 vah hindi ke un roodhiwaadee pratikon ko nahin dhonaa chaahate ki videsh gaye to hindi bol kar aa gaye
 As soon as he entered the US Congress, he started shaking hands with mps
 ek pal main unke haav-bhav par angreziyat haaavee ho gai
 The language of becoming a 'cool' leader is or may be in Hindi, but the language and body language of Mr
 Modi adopts 'coolattva' (cool is the English word) of other languages
 mistar modi aseem mahatvakankshaon se bhare netaa hai
 Despite being extremely private, he shares the franchise of his ambitions among his supporters! vah bhale hi nehru virdohi hon lekin angrezi main bolte hue vah nehru ke bhaashanon kii oonchai ko chhu lenaa chaahate hai
 His jacket, which is called Modi Jacket, was called Nehru Jacket in the modern Indian politics
 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
 Do you also find any difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi? vaajapeyi ke baad hindi bolne vaale kai netaa kshetreey dalon main the lekin unki hindi kii bhi apni simaaen raheen hai
 However, many of them were leaders born of self-respect of Hindi or opposition to English
 abhi un par bhi vistaar se charchaa nahin karnaa chahta
 Just want to say that there was no urgency, naturalness, imagination and readiness in them
 ve apni bhashaa se kam apane saamaajik aadhaar ke dam par netaa rahe
 Linguists should study whether Arvind Kejriwal's Hindi aggression in the year 2011-2012 influenced Narendra Modi or that there was some kind of linguistic competition between the two that in the same way shouting, shouting and shouting Has to be filled
 kejariwal kii hindi, satta ko lalkaar rahi thi to modi kii hindi ne satta ke pratikon ko dhahaana shuru kar diya
 He resorted to Hindi to establish himself at the national level and assured the Hindi speakers that in this era of liberalization, when it is considered natural to speak English, he can still challenge with Hindi
 hindi bolne vaala angrezi par varchasv qaayam karne kii kuntha se bharaa rahata he jise kabhi swabhimaan to kabhi rashtrawaad ke rup main samajhataa he
 In 2014, the Prime Minister's Hindi frightened the linguistic elites of Lutyens' Delhi
 jo is dar ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chaahate the, ve modi ko bahari kehane lage jabaki yah baat puri tarah satya nahin he
 Modi had gone to Gujarat from Delhi but returned when he was outsider! His speech at election rallies began to be prolonged
 log der tak unki hindi ko notice karne lage
 The aristocracy of Hindi born out of liberalization started gaining confidence through their Hindi which was subdued by the British of UPA
 pradhanmantri banate hi sabko laga ki dilli ab hindi bolegi

 But it felt a bit like he wanted to be 'accepted' in English! Is also natural
 vaise hindi main hota to is bhaashan kii gaanv gaanv main charchaa hoti lekin america or duniya main asar nahin hota
 In the US Congress, he wanted to go beyond the Prime Minister or Prime Minister
 chale bhi gaye
 In Hindi speaking houses there is no difference from English, but style English seems to indicate that the boy is gone
 bhale hi vah kitna hi kaam vaala ho 
 Mr
 Modi speaks English like Hindi
 thode sikude sikude se sarkaar nazar aate hai lekin sanbhal sanbhal kar apni baat kah jate hai
 Even if there is no naturalness, but there is seriousness
 ve angrezi par apni chhap chhod rahe hai
 His team seems to have good people writing English
 thodaa itihaas kii behatar samaj vaale log bhi hone chahie jo konark mandir ke kaal ko galat na likhe or apane netaa kii jagahansai na karaayen
 Prime Minister Modi should form a team of historians called Lefts! amareeki congress main unka bhaashan kootnithik lihaaz se bharat kii videsh niti ko america ke saamne aabhaar-niti ke rup main prakat karata he to bharat ke liye swatantra rekhaaen bhi khinchataa he
 He knows the art of preserving his natural freedom
 isliye angrezi bol rahe the lekin is baat se bephikr rahe ki mesachusets jaise mushkil uccharan ko kaise saadhaa jaae
 Just moved ahead by speaking
 har lafz or vaakya ko gambhirtha dene kaa prayaas kiya
 Manmohan Singh's speech at the US Congress was good, but Mr Prime Minister Modi made his speech memorable with his typical English speech more than his Nafees English speech
 angreziyat bhi desi or theth ho sakati he
 If you are not smitten, then the listeners remain tight! bharat-amareeki sambandhon ke pench bhaashanon se deele nahin honge
 America is basically a merchant country
 bharat prayasarat he ek vyapaaree desh main tabdeel hone ke liye
 It will talk about culture and culture, but its business policies are becoming aggressive
 prakruti kii puja kii baat hogi lekin uske dohan kii nishthurata bhi dikh jaaegi, agar koi dekhnaa chaahe to
 India is now a partner country of USA
 america bharat ke madhyamvargeey nagarikon kii mahatvakanksha he or ab rashtriya mahatvakanksha main badal rahaa he
 We are using it or they will continue to share this scholar of ours
 meraa maqasad sirf itnaa tha ki pradhanmantri kii bhashaa or style ko rekhaankit kiya jaae
 Their thought flow should be understood based on the external form of language
 kya aapako bhi pradhanmantri shri narendra modi or mistar prime ministar narendra modi main koi fark lagata he? The elections in Delhi and Bihar are important for the Prime Minister's Hindi
 donon jagahon main unki hindi unke kilaaf kaam kar gai
 People in Delhi saw that there is no humility and in Bihar people started saying that the Prime Minister has no dignity
 in do chunaavon main maine usee janata ko unki bhashaa kii copy check karte dekha jo bina dekhe number diye ja rahi thi
 People began to find his decency in Hindi
 haalanki chunavi reliyon main unki hindi ab bhi waisi hi he jaisi loksabhaa chunaavon main thi
 The bus crowd should be good
 sarkari kaaryakramon main ve hindi bolte vakt khyaal rakhte hai ki pradhanmantri hai lekin bich bich main netaa kii tarah bol jate hai jaise mithai khaanaa band kar diya he ! sansad main unki hindi par phir kabhi alag se likhuungaa
 It is not that the Prime Minister does not speak Hindi while traveling abroad, but there speak two types of Hindi
 ek jab vah bhartiya mul ke samudaay ko sambodhit karte hai or doosraa jab vah kisi raashtra pramukh ke sarkari awaas yaa daftar se media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab hindi main dete hai
 At that time, his Hindi is not like that of Narendra Modi who roars in rallies but as soon as a stadium is found they forget the difference between Madison and Mokama
 satta kii hindi se azaad ho jate hai
 We know the English power but we talk less on the Indian power
 ab aata hum mistar prime ministar narendra modi par jo videshon main angrezi bolte hai
 The Prime Minister knows English, yet he reads the speech written in English
 mistar modi ne khud ko angreji bhashi netaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye technology kaa sahaara liya he
 There is a transparent plank in front of them, on which they speak by looking at it
 ek vaakya daayen mud kar bolte hai to agle vaakya ke liye baayen mud jate hai
 He is quite different from the Hindi-speaking Modi who speaks English
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi ke bheetar angrezi bolne kii athaah chaah he
 He is a multilingual leader
 gujarati, hindi or angrezi main taqariren karte hai
 These days, Ghalib and Sufi have also started working on the penance of saints! But when he speaks English, technology binds him
 aisa lagata he haath main nayaa nayaa yphone aayaa ho
 His body language shrinks while speaking English
 jaise kisi dhoti kurte vaale ko pehali baar tite prince suut pahana diya gaya ho
 There is no moving where you stand
 bade manch kii choti si jagah kaa istamaal karte hai or bhaashan ke zariye khud ko bada karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 He spoke in Hindi in the United Nations and in English in front of the American Congress
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi har samay hindi ke swabhimaan ko nahin dhonaa chaahate
 For them, Hindi is also an opportunity and English too
 vah hindi ke un roodhiwaadee pratikon ko nahin dhonaa chaahate ki videsh gaye to hindi bol kar aa gaye
 As soon as he entered the US Congress, he started shaking hands with mps
 ek pal main unke haav-bhav par angreziyat haaavee ho gai
 The language of becoming a 'cool' leader is or may be in Hindi, but the language and body language of Mr
 Modi adopts 'coolattva' (cool is the English word) of other languages
 mistar modi aseem mahatvakankshaon se bhare netaa hai
 Despite being extremely private, he shares the franchise of his ambitions among his supporters! vah bhale hi nehru virdohi hon lekin angrezi main bolte hue vah nehru ke bhaashanon kii oonchai ko chhu lenaa chaahate hai
 His jacket, which is called Modi Jacket, was called Nehru Jacket in the modern Indian politics
 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
 Do you also find any difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi? aisa nahin he ki videsh daure par pradhanmantri hindi nahin bolte lekin vahaan do prakaar kii hindi bolte hai
 One is when he addresses a community of Indian origin and the other when he answers media queries from the official residence or office of a nation's head in Hindi
 us vakt unki hindi us narendra modi ke jaisi nahin hoti jo reliyon main dahaadte hai lekin jaise hi koi stadium miltaa he ve medicin or mokama ke fark ko bhul jate hai
 They are free from the power of Hindi
 satta kii angreziyat to ham jaanate hai lekin satta kii hindiyat par kam baat karte hai 
 Now i come to Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi who speaks English abroad
 pradhanmantri ko angrezi aati he phir bhi vah angrezi main likhaa bhaashan padhate hai
 Mr
 Modi has used technology to establish himself as an English-speaking leader
 unke saamne ek paardarshee takhti lagi hoti he jis par likhaa dekhakar wo bolte hai
 If you speak a sentence with a right, then you turn to the left for the next sentence
 ve angrezi bolte hue hindi vaale modi se kaaphi alag ho jate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a great desire to speak English
 ve bahubhashi netaa hai
 Gujarati, Hindi and English are contested
 in dinon gaalib or sufi santon ke qalaam par bhi mehnat karne lage hai! lekin jab vah angreji bolte hai to technology unhen baandh detii he
 Looks like a new iphone has arrived
 angreji bolte vakt unki dehbhasha sikud jaati he
 Like when a dhoti kurta is worn for the first time in a tight Prince suit
 jahaan khadey hote hai vahaan se hilte dulte nahin
 They use the small space of the big stage and try to enlarge themselves through speech
 vah sanyukt raashtra sangh main hindi main bole or amareeki congress ke saamne angrezi main
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to carry the pride of Hindi all the time
 unke liye hindi bhi ek avasar he or angrezi bhi
 He does not want to carry those orthodox symbols of Hindi that if he goes abroad, he comes by speaking Hindi
 amareeki congress main ghuste hi vah saansadon se haath milaane lage
 In an instant, the British dominated their attitude
 'kool' netaa banane kii dehbhasha hindi main bhi he yaa ho sakati he lekin mistar modi kii bhashaa or dehbhasha duusari bhashaaon ke 'kooltv' ( kool angrezi shabd he) ko apana leti he
 Mr
 Modi is a leader full of immense ambitions
 nitant nijee hone ke baad bhi vah apni mahatvakankshaon kii frenchizi apane samarthakon main baant dete hai! He may be anti-nehru but speaking in English, he wants to touch the height of Nehru's speeches
 unke jis jacket ko modi jacket kaha jaataa he vah aadhunik bhartiya raajnneeti ke aadikaal main nehru jacket hi kehalaata tha
 Modi wants the country and the world to see him as a Statesman
 afghanistan or amareeki congress main diya gaya unka bhaashan bhale hi unka na likhaa ho lekin kisi bhi paimaane se stareey tha
 He was going to touch the stage he wants
 mistar prime ministar modi angrezi ko angrezi kii tarah nahin bolte
 While speaking English, he is free from the discomfort of acquiring the accents that everyone nowadays suffers from
 vah apni angrezi se sunne vaale ko 'elionet' yani alag-thalag nahin karte hai

 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
 Do you also find any difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi? mistar prime ministar modi angrezi ko angrezi kii tarah nahin bolte
 While speaking English, he is free from the discomfort of acquiring the accents that everyone nowadays suffers from
 vah apni angrezi se sunne vaale ko 'elionet' yani alag-thalag nahin karte hai
 But it felt a bit like he wanted to be 'accepted' in English! Is also natural
 vaise hindi main hota to is bhaashan kii gaanv gaanv main charchaa hoti lekin america or duniya main asar nahin hota
 In the US Congress, he wanted to go beyond the Prime Minister or Prime Minister
 chale bhi gaye
 In Hindi speaking houses there is no difference from English, but style English seems to indicate that the boy is gone
 bhale hi vah kitna hi kaam vaala ho 
 Mr
 Modi speaks English like Hindi
 thode sikude sikude se sarkaar nazar aate hai lekin sanbhal sanbhal kar apni baat kah jate hai
 Even if there is no naturalness, but there is seriousness
 ve angrezi par apni chhap chhod rahe hai
 His team seems to have good people writing English
 thodaa itihaas kii behatar samaj vaale log bhi hone chahie jo konark mandir ke kaal ko galat na likhe or apane netaa kii jagahansai na karaayen
 Prime Minister Modi should form a team of historians called Lefts! amareeki congress main unka bhaashan kootnithik lihaaz se bharat kii videsh niti ko america ke saamne aabhaar-niti ke rup main prakat karata he to bharat ke liye swatantra rekhaaen bhi khinchataa he
 He knows the art of preserving his natural freedom
 isliye angrezi bol rahe the lekin is baat se bephikr rahe ki mesachusets jaise mushkil uccharan ko kaise saadhaa jaae
