 The England team, who went on a tour to New Zealand, are playing the first Test match against the hosts on the grounds of Auckland
 lekin is test match ke pehle hi din mehmaan team ke khilaaf aisa sharmnaak record darj ho gaya he, jisaki usne kalpana bhi nahin kii hogi
 In fact, the England team surrendered in front of the deadly bowling of Trent Boult and Tim Southee in the first session of the first Test and were all out for just 58 runs
 england kii team mahaj 20
 He was all out in 4 overs and 5 of his batsmen could not open the account
 130 saal baad itane kam score par out hui englandtest cricket main yah england kii team kaa pichley 130 saal main sabase nunatam score he
 Earlier, England team was allotted against Australia in 1888 for just 53 runs at Lord's ground
 lekin newjiland se liya badlaapako bataa den ki saal 1955 main england ne isi oakland ke maidan par newjiland ko mahaj 26 ranon par hi dher kar diya tha
 At that time, the New Zealand team was able to bat only 27 overs
 lekin aaj 63 saal baad newjiland ne england ko 58 ran par ol out kar apana badla puraa kar liya or oakland kaa maidan hi iskaa gavaah bana
 The lowest score in Test cricket is 26 runs, which is still the name of New Zealand
 newjiland kii ore se trent bolt ne 6 or tim southi ne 4 wicket liye
 England's entire team of just 20
 4 over main out ho gai
 England's 9 wickets had fallen to just 27 runs and were in danger of being dismissed for their lowest total in Test cricket, but Craig Overton's 33-run knock saved England from this embarrassing record
 england kii abtak kii test pariyon ke sabase kam score kii baat kii jaae to unka kharaab score australia ke khilaaf rahaa he
 England scored only 45 against Australia in a Test match played in Sydney in January 1887
 iske alaava 1994 main west indies ke khilaaf unhone 46 ran banaae the
 By the way, if we talk about the lowest score in Test cricket, this record is recorded in the name of New Zealand
 saal 1955 main newjiland ne england ke khilaaf maatr 26 ran banaae the
 At the same time, the second place in this list is from South Africa, who scored 30 against England in 1896

 jethmalani haal hi main bhaajapa pratyaashee ke taur par rajasthan se rajyasabha chunaav jite hai
 Gadkari said, "he explained everything

 "it will not be determined by other parties or other leaders," Gadkari said

 However, he also stressed that this chapter too has been closed

 Regarding Jharkhand, where the party failed to form the government with the support of JMM, Gadkari said, "we expected cooperation with Shibu Soren
" unhone iske bare main likhit patibaddhta jataai thi, lekin bhoomika badalane ke samay par vah kuch or bol rahe the, isliye hamane faisla kiya ki hamen jharkhand main sarkaar nahin banani or hamane us adhyay ko vahiin khatm kar diya

 ’’ In a metropolis like Delhi, superstition is so widespread that a woman had to give her life due to not having a child

 Police said no suicide notebarmad has been made from the deceased
 police ne mritka ke pati ko hiraasat main le liya he or poochtacha shuru kar di he
 After the post-mortem, the in-laws refused to take the dead body, while the dead body was handed over to the maternal uncle
 mritka ke parijanon ne bataaya ki takreeban chah saal pehle unhone apni beti kii shaadi aaazaad market ke rahane vaale ashok naam ke ladke se kii thi

 The in-laws also wore an amulet to the victim
 lekin jab sasuraal waalon ke ye saare upaay bhi naakaam rahe to ve use sataane lage
 Meanwhile, on Sunday, when the in-laws started planning their son's second marriage, the victim was not tolerated

 Now the market expects a general budget

 This time the market expectations are low, so if any logical measures are taken in the budget, the market reaction can also be positive
 chaalu varsh main abhi tak share bazaar main 13
 There has been a 69 percent drop and experts believe that market performance can improve after the budget, provided that constraints in terms of financing and bottlenecks in terms of implementation on the regional front are reduced

 During the discussion on the triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha, there was an uproar from the ruling party in the House over an objectionable comment by Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan
 kuch samay baad ajam khan loksabhaa kii kaarywahi bich main hi chhodkar chale gaye
 Sumitra Mahajan, a former speaker of the Lok Sabha, has also received a statement on this issue
 mahajan ne kaha ki unhone (ajam khan) samooche sadan kaa anadar kiya he
 Sumitra Mahajan said, 'there are some rules which he (azam Khan) should have followed
 main aisa nahin kah rahi hum ki unhen dandit kiya janaa chahie lekin unhen apane bayaan par khud gaur karnaa chahie
 Whatever you say in Parliament, you should take great care of it
 kai baar aisa hota he ki log duusare se aamane saamne baat karne lagate hai jabaki unhen hameshaa kursi (chair) kii taraf dekhakar bolnaa chahie
 Today, he has not disrespected any woman but disrespected the entire house

 What happened to Akhilesh ji today? How much respect you give to the chair matters a lot, so looking at the chair is said to speak
 unhen khud apni galati par gaur karnaa chahie tha
 For this, training should be started
 inhen naitikta padhai jaani chahie
 The objection is not about the language but what is spoken and how it is spoken, it remains to be seen
 'sumitra mahajan ne kaha ki 'aise bayaan kisi bahan ke liye nahin die jate
 They should apologize
 is bare main unki party ko sochna chahie ki jab tak ve maafee nahin maangate, unhen sadan main bolne kii ijaajat nahin deni chahie

 He said that his government has eliminated black marketing and corruption in the field of fertilizers
 unhone kisaanon se sirf neem coted uria kaa istemaal karne ko kaha he or apni aay badhaane ke liye nayi fasal beemaa lene ko kaha he
 He also announced that all farmers will get a soil health card by 2017
 kisaanon tak pahunchane ke bijepi ke rashtravyapee abhiyaan ke tahat ek kisaan raily ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pehle uria kii kalabazari hua karti thi or kisaanon ko uria hasil karne ke liye lathicharge kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha, lekin ab sthiti badal gai he
 The government has focused on increasing production and curbing diversion of urea
 modi ne kaha ki unhen is saal rajyon se khaad kii maang ko lekar koi patr nahin mila he
 "we have taken a big step to end corruption and black marketing of urea," he said
 yahi kaaran he ki inamen se kuch log mere khilaaf chillaate rahete hai

 He has asked farmers to use only neem coated urea and to get new crop insurance to increase their income
 unhone yah bhi ghoshnaa kii ki sabhi kisaanon ko 2017 tak mrudaa swasthya card milegaa
 Addressing a farmers rally as part of bjp's nationwide campaign to reach farmers, the Prime Minister said that earlier there was black marketing of urea and farmers had to face lathicharge to acquire urea, but now the situation has changed
 sarkaar ne utpaadan badhaane or uria ke diverjan par ankush lagane par dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 Modi said that he has not received any letter from the states this year seeking fertilizer
 unhone kaha, hamane bhrashtachar or uria kii kalabazari ko khatm karne ke liye bada kadam uthaaya he

 supreme court kaa faisla kaisaa he, isse pehle ki aap jawaab den, log khud hi bol dete hai ki chalo bavaal khatm hua
 But even then the first question remains, what was the decision like
 yah vaaki tarif kii baat he ki janata ne sanyam or paripakvata ke saath saamana kiya
 That public would also like to know what the decision is like
 faisle kii nuktachini se vah nahin ghabaraane vaali
 When this decision reached by consensus will be taught in the class of law, then there will hardly be a consensus among the students
 aitihaasik faisla he isliye isaki samiksha aaj hi nahin, lambey samay tak hoti rahegi
 Historical verdict, consensus verdict but which part is written, it is absent
 live lau ne kaha he ki supreme court ke itihaas main aisa kabhi nahin hua
 Now, in 2017, 9 judges gave a decision on the right to privacy
 aam sahmati kaa faisla tha lekin pehle panne se pataa chal jaataa he ki koun sa hissaa kis jaj ne likhaa he
 In this case, the Allahabad High Court had more than 8000 pages, it is estimated that the Supreme Court's decision is eight times less than 1045 pages
 kam mehnat lagegi lekin acha hoga ki aap khud bhi is faisle ko padhein
 You will get to know a lot
 supreme court hi ijazat detaa he ki uske faisle kii samiksha kii ja sakati he
 The court may also be requested to review the verdict and ordinary people can also review the verdict in their discussions
 bas aap yah nahin kah sakate ki kis vajah se is jaj ne aisa likhaa hoga, agar aap manshaa jodenge to avmaananaa kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Generally, politicians decide on which decision of the Supreme Court to do politics and not on which
 babari masjid ram janmabhumi vaale faisle ke maamle main court kaa faisla kismat vaala rahaa ki sabhi raajnneetik dalon ne kaha ki ham raajnneeti nahin karenge
 will accept
 lekin jab 2018 main sabarimala ko lekar supreme court kaa faisla aayaa tab bijepi hi is faisle kaa virodh karne vaale logon ke saath khadi ho gai
 Did not say that we support the decision of the Supreme Court
 is faisle ko lekar grahamantri amit shah kaa bayaan he ki ham is faisle ke khilaaf pradarshan karne waalon ke saath hai
 Amit Shah had tweeted that in the case of Sabarimala the nation has witnessed a fight between religion, faith and devotion and the oppressive government of Kerala
 sarkaar ayappa ke bhakton ko dabaane main takat kaa istamaal kar rahi he
 Amit Shah did not say then that he was with the Supreme Court
 tab nahin kaha tha ki kerala sarkaar ko supreme court ke faisle ko lagu karnaa chahie
 While the decision of Sabarimala was given by a bench of 5 judges
 ek mahila jaj ne asahmati zaahir kii thi
 Now this decision is also again presented before the bench of 5 judges for review
 march 2018 main anusuchit jati janajati act ke maamle main supreme court ne faisla de diya ki bina jaanch se pehle kisi lok sevak kii giraftaar nahin hogi
 India stopped against this decision
 isamen 11 logon kii jaan gai thi
 Scheduled Caste mps came under pressure and the government had to change the decision within Parliament
 ab isi faisle ko supreme court ne badal diya he
 The decision of the two-judge bench was changed by the three-judge bench
 raajnneetik dal jab yah kahen ki supreme court ke faisle par raajnneeti nahin kerani he to yah unki raajnneeti hoti he
 Therefore reviewing the verdict is a sign of a mature democracy
 supreme court ne apane faisle ke oparative part kii shuruyaat justise, equity or good kanshiens se kii he jisaki charchaa sunni vakf board ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne hi bahes ke dauraan kii thi
 The judgment chronicles the long history of Justice Equity and the origin of Good Conscience
 yah rome se shuru hua
 Later in the 16th century, the British-made law dissolved
 kisi hindi channel ko pataa nahin chalaa varna hedline banaata ki rome aayaa ram ke kaam or darshak ram ke kaam aayaa rome
 However, the principle of Justice Equity and Good Conscience was adopted because this principle of justice gives opportunity to the judges that when the law is insufficient, not enough, in a particular situation, then decisions can be taken on the basis of justice, equality and good conscience
 
 iske liye duusare deshon main liye gaye faisle ke aadhaar ko dekhnaa bhi harj nahin he
 The purpose of this is to state that in the present case also there are many aspects which do not fit the scale of the existing law
 kya vaaki hamaare is cese ke aise kai pahalu the jinka nipataara karne ke liye hamaare maujuuda kanoonon main paryaapt kshamta nahin thi? yah sawaal he magar jawaab hamaare paas nahin he
 In the judgment, it is underlined that this is a dispute of 4 centuries
 In the meantime, the Mughals ruled India, the East India Company ruled, the British ruled, and then the Constitution of independent India came into force
 vivaadit parisar 1861 se hi nazul kii bhoomi par he yani sarkari bhoomi he
 The government has never claimed that the land belongs to us
 1861, 1893-94 or 1936-37 ke rajasav record main is jagah ko janmasthan kaha gaya he
 The revenue record does not mention the mosque, the royal mosque or the birthplace mosque
 zamin par masjid thi iske pramaan 1856 ke avadh anexeshan ke baad kaa he
 No royal decree before 1856 could be introduced
 iske baad tark diya gaya ki chunki vahaan namaaz hoti thi isliye vah vakf kii zamin maani jaaegi
 The court investigates this matter with several decisions
 dekhati he ki aise maamle main kis faisle main kaise faisla diya gaya he
 The court says that it is then seen whether the place was used for namaz or prayer
 isi aadhaar par kai maamalon main aise faisle die gaye hai ki tab ise vakf kii zamin maani jaaegi
 The court says that between 1528 and 1856, proof of prayers was not offered
 isliye nahin kaha ja saktaa ki iskaa istamaal dharmik ho rahaa tha
 When the railing is built in 1856, no one claims who owns the land
 agrezon ke dauraan bahari parisar main angrezon ne hinduon ke dharmik adhikaar ko manyata di
 Muslims also did not lay claim to the outer complex
 na hi ve 1857 ke baad iskaa istamaal kar rahe the
 Questions are being raised on two aspects regarding the court's decision
 elahabaad hoicourt ne eesai se poocha tha ki babari masjid khaali zamin par bani thi yaa pehle koi dhaancha tha
 The ASI did not say in its report whether the mosque was built after the temple was demolished
 ASI ne yah zarur kaha ki zamin ke neeche puraani imaaraton ke avshesh milte hai jo mandir jaise prathit hote hai
 The ASI stated that the time of construction of these remains takes place from the 12th century
 court kahata he ki ASI kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki 12veen sadi ke dhaanche kaa istamaal masjid main hua
 The ASI has said that the mosque was not built on the empty land
 court maanata he ki puratathvik saakshyon se sabit nahin hota ki masjid ke liye hindu mandir todaa gaya
 This was the biggest lie of this politics which was cleared by the court in its judgment
 mandir tod kar masjid banane ke naam par uttar bharat main kitna bavaal machaa lekin yah baat supreme court main sabit nahin hui
 a part of the Supreme Court's decision is more important
 is baat ke pramaan milte hai ki 16 disambar 1949 ko namaaz adaa kii gai thi
 The idol was placed there on the intervening night of 22 / 23 December 1949, after which the prayers were stopped
 musalamaanon ko is jagah se kanoon ke aadhaar par bedakhal nahin kiya gaya balki soch samaj kar ibaadatgah se bedakhal kar diya gaya
 The court in its judgment assured that the statue was illegally kept in the mosque on the night of 22-23 December 1949
 tab kya adaalat ko yah nahin kahana chahie ki is ghatana ko lekar azaad bharat kii adaalaton ne kya rukh apanaaya, kya gaiyr kanoonee maanate hue musalamaanon ke haq main faisla diya
 Did not give balki jab murti hataane ke aadesh die gaye to zila prashasan ne murti hataane se inkaar kar diya
 If it was injustice, what justice should have been
 1992 main babari masjid dhwast kar di gai
 If this building does not collapse, then what would have been decided in this case, it can be thought
 magar supreme court ne is ghatana par bhi usee aamasahmati se faisla diya he jis aam sahmati se is masale kaa faisla hua he
 The structure of the mosque was torn down on 6 December 1992
 yathasthiti rakhane ke aadesh kaa ulanghan karte hue masjid todi gai
 The court was assured that the status quo would remain
 masjid ko dhahaana kanoon ke raaj kaa khulaa ulanghan tha
 These two decisions are very important in this decision of the Supreme Court
 hazaron kii sankhya main log or kai bade netaa is kaam main shaamil the yaa masjid giraane ke vakt maujuud the, ve sabhi ram mandir ke nirmaan se jude andolan main bhi sakriy rahe
 Are they also welcoming the decision of the Supreme Court, while the Supreme Court has considered that work illegal
 ram maryaada purushottam maane jate hai
 The verdict in Ayodhya has come in favor of the temple where the limits of the constitution were dismantled in 1949 and in 1992
 usee samvidhan ke tahat mandir kaa faisla aayaa he
 If seen, where will all those criminals be at this time, what will they be thinking about this act, will they come to the court by themselves remembering Rama that they had committed this crime
 kya aise log us trust main bhi honge jise supreme court ke aadesh se bananaa he
 How can those who are criminals of law, who have not been caught, be involved in any process related to temple construction? In April 2017, the Supreme Court had ordered that the trial should be completed within two years in the mosque demolition case
 do saal puraa ho chukaa he
 The disputed land is a complete entity
 1856-57 main railing banaai gai thi lekin zamin yaa swaamitv kaa bantwaaraa nahin hua tha
 The Sunni Central Waqf Board also could not give proof of the right to occupy the land
 hinduon kaa bahari parisar main nirantar kabza rahaa or puja archana hoti rahi
 There were disputes in the Hindu and Muslim sides regarding the inner campus
 16 disambar 1949 tak namaaz hoti rahi
 The decision was taken in favor of the Hindus on the basis of constant occupation of the outer premises
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki april 1950 main vivaadit kshetra kaa nirikshan hua to kai pakke sakshya mili
 It includes maps, sculptures, pathways and buildings
 parikrama maarg par pakkaa or kaccha rasta bana tha

 Several photographs and their evidence are also recorded in the investigation and report of the Department of Archeology in January 1990

 It was stated on behalf of Ramlala Virajman that during the inspection in 1950, the mosque was claimed there but despite that it was found that there were many photographs, carvings and buildings which prove that that mosque was not valid
 vaidyanathan ne eesai kii report vaale elbum kii tasviren, mehrab or kaman kii tasviren bhi court ko dikhain, jo 1990 main khinchi gai thim
 The Ram Janmabhoomi is engraved on the stone pillars in it
 tasveeron main bhi saaf-saaf dikhataa he
 The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Yatra is also written on the stone pillars in the report of the commissioner
 shriram janmabhumi punaroddhar samiti (yachika 9) shankaracharya kii ore se kaha gaya ki vah prince of wales kii yatra kii yaad main likhaa gaya shilaalekh tha
 The sculptures, designs, graphs and artefacts made on the pillars and the roof are of the Hindu tradition ornamented in the temples
 masjidon main maanviya yaa jeev-jantuon kii murtiyon nahin ho hotin, hon to vah jagah masjid hi nahin ho sakati
 Prayer can be offered anywhere in Islam
 masjiden to samuhik saptahik or dainik prarthana ke liye hi hoti hai
 Referring to the photograph of 1990 from Ramlala Virajaman, it was said that these pictures have pictures of lion and lotus in the pillar
 is tarah ke chitra kabhi bhi islamic parampara kaa hissaa nahin ho sakate
 Justice Bhushan said that the photo taken by the commission in 1950, which is about the place, suggests that it is more reliable than the 1990 photo
 ramalala kii tarah se kaha gaya ki isamen koi vivaad nahi ki vahaan pillar moujdu the
 The order of the High Court was read out by Ramlala Virajaman in which the court asked the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to inspect the disputed site
 ramalala virajman kii taraf se kaha gaya ki duusare material kaa carbon dating kiya gaya tha
 Justice Bobde said that we probably asked carbon dating of Murthy? On behalf of the Muslim side, it was said that Justice Bobde had asked whether the carbon dating of the deity had taken place? From the Muslim side it was said that there cannot be carbon dating of brick
 carbon dating tabhi ho sakati he jab usamen carbon kii maatra ho
 It was said on behalf of Ramlala that the carbon dating of the deity has not taken place
 ayodhya maamle (ayodhya Case) par supreme court main sunwaayee somvaar ko jari rahegi
 On behalf of Ramlala Virajaman, CS Vaidyanathan said that on Monday, they will put forward the statements of the witnesses after debating the ASI report
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki unhen abhi bahes ke liye or teen se chaar ghante kaa samay chahie
 On Monday, Ram Lalla's side will be kept

 Today is the birthday of writer Ramkumar Singh
 unka janm 17 sitambar, 1975 ko rajasthan ke fatehpur shekhavati ke birania main hua
 He is a well-known name as a good screenwriter, lyricist, cine-critic
 unki kahani par aadhaarit rajasthani film 'bhobhar' ne kai rashtriya, antarrashtriya film samarohon main lokapriyata kaa nayaa mukaam hasil kiya he
 At the same time, the film made on the novel 'Z Plus' was very successful
 'zed plus' upanyaas kaa nayak asalam pancharavaala he
 He gets Jade Security in a gag
 zed sicurity milane ke baad uski jindagi main bhuuchaal aa jaataa he
 Holded in the country's highest security circle, Aslam does not understand whether it is a boon or a curse for him
 penchdaar, dilachasp or thriller upanyaason kii-si raftaar se chalata hua yah upanyaas apni prastuti main hindi ke lokapriy katha-lekhan ke liye ek gambheer or sarkaar-sajag prasthaan bindu he
 Read the excerpt from this book on literature till the birthday of writer Ramkumar Singh today
 pustak ansh: zed pluspradhanmantri kii yatra, habib miyaan se jhagada, scooter chori or ab jed suraksha main rahane vaale asalam miyaan ko is bhagdaud main saidaa kii yaad naa ai ho aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 But there was another difficulty
 kehane ko vah suraksha main tha lekin asalam par choubison ghanton paharaa tha
 Raju had missed going to the Panwadi shop
 yah bhi nahin pataa tha ki in beete dinon main shahar main kya ghatit ho gaya he
 When he complained to the collector about the demolition of his shop, his shop was repaired since then, but the problem now becomes another
 yah maamuli logon kaa shahar tha
 They saw the board, Aslam Puncharwala, but who stopped, when they saw two police vehicles parked outside the shop
 do bike khadi hai
 Ten to eleven uniformed guards are guarded outside
 dhandha thap hone laga
 The opposite happened with Hamida
 uski dukaan par auraton kii graahaki bad gai
 She used to look for excuses to talk to Hamida throughout the day and the hand shoes were also sold
 asalam kii dukaan par cycle bhi aae to use suraksha jaanch se guzarana padataa
 Rajesh always suspected that the person who threatened him could also kill Aslam with a bicycle bomb
 asalam ne tay kar liya ki ab vah pankchar kii dukaan par nahin baithegaa
 He talked to Hamida
 isi baat par hamida or asalam ke bich jhagada badhane laga tha
 Hamida used to say good and bad to the Prime Minister every day on something or the other
 asalam use kahata, pradhanmantri kii kya galati he? unhone to sab bhale ke liye kiya he
 Now, for many days, Aslam was realizing that he has received threats from Pakistan by repeatedly telling people
 yahi baat jab usne hamida ke saamne kahi to hamida chilla padi, ''muay, kamanaa-dhamanaa sab chhod diya he, upar se tumhen pakistan maaregaa
 Better then kill you
 yun to lagegaa ki mar gaya khasm
 Now i have to raise children
 ''saidaa aisi nahin he
 She talks so fondly
 kitna acha hota hamida yadi ikbaal kii bivi hoti
 How much is the nature of both
 meraa swabhaav to saidaa se hi miltaa he
 But Aslam was also stuck in a new problem
 jiskaa ahsaas use ab honevaala tha
 Saeeda was upset that Aslam did not take the news for so long
 din-bhar chudiyon kii dukaan par baithi saidaa raju panwari kii dukaan kii taraf aas lagaae dekhati rahati thi ki shaayad uske bhuule harjaai ko apni saidaa kii yaad aae
 The yearning was equal
 asalam miyaan roj saidaa ko yaad karte the lekin ab jed suraksha ke changul main ghir gaye the
 He could not muster the courage to go to Saida's house with Jade security
 aakhirkaar chori-chhipe milanaa alag baat hoti he
 The simple meaning of taking all this frills there was to find Hamida in the whole locality, the whole town, and even more dangerously, to know that one of her sons was in the aspect of her husband
 kalpana maatr se hi vah kaanp jaataa
 But do those who flirt ever stop? Aslam Mian thought in his mind
 is bhagdaud or hamida ke taanon se dur wo ek din ke liye sukun chahta tha
 "whatever happens, tonight i will go to meet Saeeda
 ”asalam ne man hi man tay kar liya tha
 Aslam's condition turned into a hostage
 paidaa hone se lekar aaj tak use yah samaran nahin aa rahaa tha ki vah kabhi itane bandhanon main rahaa
 Whenever he was about to leave, he would recall his insistence on z Security Head Captain Rajesh that he should be informed at least half an hour before, so that they could make their preparations
 shuruaati dinon main jyon hi asalam jane ko taiyaar hota tha, yah soochna detaa tha
 Aslam would pick up his Lambretta scooter and walk past two security bikers and a gypsy behind him
 in par mustaid faujee rahete
 The bike was infield and with the start, the entire locality knew that Aslam Mian was now going to the market
 uske thik peeche ek gahare hare rang kii gypsy hoti jisaki chat ke bich-bich ek chhed kiya gaya tha
 There was an iron mesh on the glass in front of him
 chat ke bich vaale chhed se ek aadmi apana munh nikaalkar khadaa hota tha
 a black scarf was tied over his face
 awwal to kaale rang kaa vah faujee vaise hi khatarnaak dikhataa tha
 After tying this scarf he looked even stronger and scarier
 kisi kii majaal nahin ki vah bike ke peeche or gypsy ke aage chal rahe asalam miyaan kii taraf aankh uthaakar bhi dekh sake
 When there was a crowd in the market, the gypsy siren would also play
 mohalle waalon main dar tha ki kabhi asalam miyaan ko chat se gaur se dekh liya or kisi surakshakarmi kii us par najar pad gai to use to pakkaa goli kaa shikaar hona padegaa
 This fear did not come spontaneously
 is dar kii shuruyaat raju panwari kii dukaan se hui thi
 Raju Panwadi, who considered himself knowledgeable in everything, tried to give his full knowledge on Jade security that day
 paan par chuunaa lagaate hue usne sharif miyaan ko bhadakaane kii koshish kii thi,''dargah kii seva to aapane bhi kii he miyaan? aapako to koi dhamkee nahin mili
 "'" Is a number shooter
 main jaanata hum use koi dhamkee-vamaki nahin mili
 He is fooling everyone
 xxrep 4 ' dekhnaa ek din pole khulegi isaki
 "the world is living up to the expectation, Sharif Mian was waiting for the days of Aslam's downfall
" yah bhaaiyon kii aapasi jalan hi thi jaise asalam ke patan main hi uske utthan kaa rahasy chipa hua he

 His name will be 'tara'

 However, there may be legal hurdles in the adoption process
 darasal god lene ke bhartiya niyamon ke mutabik agar donon parents kii kul umr 90 saal se zyada he to wo god nahin le sakate hai or ek maheene baad 15 april ko hi mandira or raaj kii umr milakar 90 saal hone vaali he
 Abu Azmi asked Karan Johar, who became a father of surrogacy, "is there any disease?" During a conversation with a newspaper, Mandira said, "we started the adoption process a year ago, but it is a long and tedious process
" isliye hamane fasebuk par likhane kaa faisla kiya

 Sardar Patel and Bureaucracy Prime Minister Modi said, 'bureaucracy and system have become two words today which have become negative perceptions in themselves

 In Jalpaiguri, West Bengal, a man was forced to comment on Facebook about the local Trinamool leader
 soshal media ke prem ne use jail bhej diya, vahiin coment viral ho gaya
 Rohit Pasi, a resident of Mal in the district, wrote on his Facebook without naming any leader that the leader accused of murder was seen sweating the court to get bail
 rohit pashi ke is post se aahat hokar nigam parshad pulin goldaar ne police main iske khilaaf shikaayat kii
 The councilor said that this post of Rohit is defamatory and inciting violence
 goldaar ne kaha, 'pashi ne meraa naam nahin liya tha, lekin ek netaa jisane jamaanat par hastakshar kiya or bansuri bajaata he ke bare main likhaa
 Who else is the second leader in Mal, who signed bail on Friday
 jo bansuri bajaata he
 Obviously it was about me
 ''rasta rokane ke maamle main gaya tha court'goldaar ne aage kaha, 'main adaalat main is puraane maamle main jamaanat lene ke liye gaya tha, jo rasta rokane se sambandhit he
 But in this post i am described as a murderer

 Police claimed that he was not arrested

 'police pulled from home' On the other hand, Rohit Passi said that the police pulled him out of the house like a criminal and put him behind bars for over an hour
 unhone kaha ki ve netaaon kii pole kholte hai, isliye unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 They were accused of inciting violence which is baseless

 The faith of devotees has been played hundreds of times in this country
 or abhi is vakt bhi desh ke kis kone main naa jane koun sa baba bhakton se khel rahaa ho
 But this new baba has come out from Delhi among all the Bundabaz, cheaters and Gurugantal babas, it has done wonders
 dharm or aasthaa ke naam par jo dukaan sajaai wo puri kii puri dukaan hi dhong kii nikali
 People were digging Ashu Maharaj and Asif Khan came out of the Maharaj
 ji haa
 Ashu Maharaj, who was caught in the gang rape charges, is being searched by the Delhi Police
 uskaa asli naam darasalasif khanhe
 Whom the world famous astrologer
 hastrekha visheshgy or kaale jaadu kaa maharathi maanakar koti koti naman kar rahi thi
 That Baba turned out to be a traitor from head to toe
 ekamhilaor uski bacchee ke saath chhedchhad hi nahin
 Rather, Ashu Bhai Guruji has played with the faith of thousands of his devotees
 asif khan niklaa aashu bhaijise bhakt aashu bhai guruji maanakar charnon main sheesh nava rahe the
 He is actually Asif Khan
 or isaki gavaahi wo voter list de rahi he
 On which is the picture of Ashu Bhai Guruji and it is written in front of him, Asif Khan's son Shri Idah Khan
 voter list main galati kii gunjaaish isliye nazar nahin aati kyonki thik usee ke neeche usee pate par rahane vaale asif khan ke bete samar khan kii bhi tasviir lagi he
 Despite being a Muslim, Asif Khan became an Ashu Bhai Guruji and played with the faith of the devotees
 to phir sawaal ye ki aakhir asif khan kyon bana aashu bhai guruji
 So the answer will be the history of Asif Khan
 ajtak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik aashu bhai guruji ne asif khan banakar apane gorakhdhandhe kii shuruuaat saal 1990 main kii
 How did Asif Khan become Ashu Bhai Guruji? Ashu lived in JJ Colony in Wazirpur, Delhi till 1990
 magar saal 2018 aate aate wo karodon kaa maalik ban gaya
 Ashu not only has crores of rupees but also many expensive cars
 sarai rohilla ke padam nagar ilaake main apane dhandhe shuruuaat kii
 Ashu Bhai Guruji started the business of telling the future of others
 jald hi aashu bhai guruji ko apana dhandha band karnaa padaa
 Because the servant of Ashu's house ran away with his 50 lakh rupees
 rohinee ilaake se shuru kiya dhandhashuruuaati dinon main hi 50 lakh ke ghate ne aashu ko padam nagar se dhandha band karne par majaboor kar diya
 But now Asif Khan aka Ashu Bhai had to understand what his future might be like but there is a big advantage in telling the future of others
 lihaaza padam nagar se nikalakar aashu bhai ne rohinee ilaake main apana dhandha phir se shuru kiya
 This business of telling the future of Ashu Bhai Ashu Bhai is the owner of crores of property, so much flourished that now Alam is that Baba has property in many areas of Delhi
 jisamen preetam pura ke tarun anklev main makaan
 Rohini Sektor 7 has offices in posh areas like Ashram and Hauz Khas in South Delhi
 or to or baba ne ab apana bijnes itnaa badhaa liya tha ki wo ayurvedic doctor bhi gaya tha
 Where he used to treat himself and also make medicines himself
 matlab ek baar murga funs gaya to ye baba uskaa khun tak chus liya karata tha
 Ashu Bhai also made a mistake like other babas till his money was fine
 magar paisa kamaane ke saath aashu bhai guruji urf asif khan ne vahi galati kar di jo unase pehle asaram baapu, gurmeet ram rahim, virendra dikshit jaise or duusare baabaaon ne kii
 That means playing with the wishes of women devotees
 or yaheen funs gaye aashu bhai guruji
 The woman lodged a report, registering a case under the Poxo Act of the victim woman living in Ghaziabad, under the Poxo Act, the police are putting all the possible targets in search of Guruji
 kal tak singhaasana par baithkar logon ko unka bhavishya bataanevaale guruji ko bhaagane ke liye zamin kam padati ja rahi he
 It is expected that soon this Baba will also go to the same place where the group of fake Babas has already reached
 bhavishya bataane kaa dhandhub tak ye to samaj aa chukaa tha asif khan paisa kamaane ke chakkar main aashu bhai bana tha
 But from where did he learn Yejyotism and palmistry
 haalanki ye khulaasa asif kii giraftaar ke baad hi ho sakegaa magar shuruuaati jaanch main ye pataa chalaa he ki jab use ye ehsaas hua ki kismat bataane kaa ye dhandha uski kismat badal saktaa he to usne pehle isaki baarikiyaan sikhin or phir puri taiyaari ke saath naam badalakar is dhandhe main kuuda asif urf aashu bhai guruji
 The FIR lodged at Hauz Khas police station was doing everything right
 baba pichley kareeb 25 saalon main rank se raja ban chukaa tha
 He set up a property worth crores of billions
 tab tak to thik tha
 But as soon as he started taking undue advantage of the devotees' devotion
 uskaa bure vakt kaa syran bajane laga
 But he could not hear this sound
 or wo ghaziabad kii peedit mahila kaa lagaataar shoshan kiye ja rahaa tha
 He even molested the woman's daughter
 takat kaa nasha uske sir par chadha hua tha
 But this FIR was lodged in the Hauz Khas police station
 bharat ko rus kii ore se bheji gai prakritik gas kii pehali khep mil gai he
 Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan arrived on board the Russian ship LNG Kano and received it at Dahej Port in Gujarat

 The Union Minister said that the Modi government is moving towards moving the country towards a gas-based economy
 pradhan ne kaha ki hamane sabase pehle katar se aane vaale alenji ke daam ko lekar naye sire se baatcheet kii, uske baad australia kii aapurti par kaam kiya or ab rus se nai sharton ke tahat alenji kii aapurti shuru hui he
 The increase in bilateral trade & investments between india-russia in the oil & gas sector has a win-win effect for either sides
 While providing a major market to high volume gas reserves of Russia, It also helps India address it’s energy needs & establish a gas based economy

 desh main kareeb 40 lakh gharon main gas conection hai or petroleum mantralay ne 2 saal ke bheetar ise badhaakar ek karod karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 If more and more people use PNG instead of LPG, then the burden of subsidy on the government can be reduced

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while referring to the release of Masood Azhar, the leader of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, during the NDA regime, accused the BJP government of compromising on the challenges of terrorism
 shanivaar congress mukhyalay main ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki agar congress satta main aati he to vah modi sarkaar kii apeksha aatankwaad se nipatane main kadaa rukh apnayegi
 The Congress chief said, "masood Azhar is a terrorist and must be punished, but i want to ask who sent him to Pakistan?" Rahul Gandhi said that his party has not sent any terrorist to Pakistan
 bijepi netritv par desh kii arthvyavastha ko barbaad karne kaa aarope lagaate hue gandhi ne kaha, ‘main in dinon ek daraa hua pradhanmantri dekhtaa hum jo vipakshi partiyon ke hamale nahin jhel paata he
 Gandhi accused the Election Commission of adopting a 'completely biased' attitude towards the opposition, saying that according to the internal survey of the Congress, the BJP was losing this Lok Sabha election
 rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki chunaav aadha se zyada khatm ho chukaa he or ye spasht he ki narendra modi chunaav haar rahe hai
 Rahul said that corruption of farmers, employment and PM are the main issues in this election and after four phases of Lok Sabha elections it is very clear that BJP is losing this election
 iske alaava rahul gandhi ne rafel or rojgaar se lekar chunaav ayog ke mudde par bhi apni baat rakhi
 Rahul said that the biggest issue facing the country is unemployment
 piem modi ne arthvyavastha ko nasht kar diya he
 The country is asking Modi that two crore jobs were promised, but today the country is facing the worst condition of 45 years
 sargical strike ko lekar bhi rahul gandhi ne piem modi kii aalochana kii
 He said that Army is not the personal property of Narendra Modi
 narendra modi sochate hai sena unki property he
 Rahul, in response to the questions raised on the surgical strike during the UPA government, said that PM Modi is denigrating the army by calling the army strike a video game
 sena kisi vyakti nahin, balki desh kii hoti he
 Significantly, 'jaish-e-mohammed' kingpin Masood Azhar has been declared a 'global terrorist' by the United Nations
 vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit kiye jane ke baad pakistan ne uski sampatti jabt karne or us par yatra pratibandh lagane kaa aadesh jari kiya he
 After being declared a global terrorist, Masood Azhar has also been banned for selling and selling weapons

 Rahul said that the way of working of Narendra Modi, BJP and RSS is to put pressure on institutions and from the Supreme Court to the RBI, it is visible everywhere
 rahul ne kaha ki chunaav ayog se bhi isse achoota nahin he lekin ayog jo bhi kar le, hindustan kii janata ne man bana liya he
 Rahul said that the commission should fulfill its responsibility

 pakistan ke ek vaigyanik ne chetavanee di he ki desh kii sena main badhate kattarpanth kii vajah seppermanu hathiyaarkattarpanthi islamic logon ke haathon main ja sakate hai
 Pakistani scientist Pervez Hudbhoy, who came to London to release his book Confronting the Bomb, said in two words that the safety and security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons is a matter of great concern
 unhone kaha ki sena ke andruni thikaanon par hue hamale bataate hai ki sena ke andar kattarpanth bad rahaa he or isse parmaanu hathiyaaron ke kattarpathiyon ke haathon main jane kaa khatra he
 Nuclear physics scientist and defense analyst Hudbhoy said that Pakistan has 120 to 130 armaments just like India
 vah kal shaam yahaan indaali lounj main ‘indian jarnlists association’ ke sadasyon ke sawaalon ke jawaab de rahe the
 He said that in the past such weapons were seen only as deterrent measures
 lekin sabase khatarnaak baat aise hathiyaaron kii saamagree kii badhati khoj he jisase parmaanu yuddh kaa nayaa pahalu saamne aa gaya he
 This means that the number of weapons is increasing rapidly
 ’masachusets institute of technology (emiti) se parmaanu bhautikee main piechdi kii oopaadhi le chuke hudbhoy ne kaha ki up mahadwipiya or vaishvik suraksha kii khatir is mudde ke hal kii jarurat he
 The scientist said that India and Pakistan had reached the brink of nuclear war at least five times
 varsh 1987 main, varsh 1990 main, kargil yuddh (varsh 1999) ke dauraan, varsh 2001 main bhartiya sansad par hamale ke baad or varsh 2008 main mumbai hamalon ke baad donon desh parmaanu yuddh ke bilkul kareeb the
 Hoodbhoy said that in view of the tension arising due to nuclear war, we cannot allow the status quo to remain on this issue
 ‘visphot ke baad radiodharmita kaa bhayaavah asar hota he jisase na sirf up mahadweep balki puri duniya par hi asar hoga
 Called "confronting the Book (pakistani and Indian Scientist Speak Out)", the book has been published by Oxford University Press and edited by Hudbhoy
 yah seemaa ke donon ore ke vaigyanikon ke nibandhon kaa sangrah he
 It started in India in the nuclear age in 1974, after which Pakistan entered it
 varsh 1998 main parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad ek tarah se parmaanu shastron kii hode shuru ho gai
 Hoodbhoy said that Pakistan started developing nuclear weapons because India was doing so
 bharat pramukh shatru bana hua he
 But the recent statement by General Kayani (chief of Pakistan's Army) in this perception seems to change that Pakistan's biggest challenge is the enemies within it
 ’ vaigyanik ne kaha ki is prakaar sena kii soch main hi badlaav kaa sanket miltaa he ‘lekin kayaani bhi fouj main aalochana se batch nahin paae
 'hoodbhoy admitted that he himself is receiving threats to kill him
 unhone kaha ‘jihadi pakistan main sakriy hai or islamic takaton ke bare main rajya kii niti spasht nahin he
 Hoodbhoy, who is known for speaking against Pakistani nuclear installations, is a visiting professor in the Physics Department of Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)
 unhen bharat or pakistan main parmaanu praudyogiki ke shantipurna upyog ko lekar bhi sanshay he
 He said, 'the biggest question is whether nuclear power will actually produce electricity
 ’ hudbhoy ne kaha ‘parmaanu riektaron kaa nirmaan bahut kharchila hota he
 An incident like the one at the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011 can also happen in India and Pakistan

 The public will decide who will become the Prime Minister of the country, but our leaders have come out in disarray with the vote
 pehle sapa netaa naresh agarwal ne modi par vyaktigat tippanee kii
 In response to this, BJP leader Kirti Azad told Naresh Agarwal to be 'namo Naniya' and advised him to send him to the mental asylum
 vyaktigat tippanee karte hue kirti aaazaad ne kaha, 'naresh agarwal ko paagalakhaane bhejne kii jarurat he
 The place in Ranchi Mental Hospital is not empty but i have talked to Agra Hospital
 ve vahiin bhartee ho jaaen or is ilaaj ke liye main kharch uthaaunga
 Targeting Mulayam on the pretext of Naresh Agarwal's statement, Kirti Azad said, "naresh Agarwal wants to tell that who is a corrupt, wrestling wrestler
 jo shikshak ho
 Whoever becomes the Chief Minister then earns crores and billions, cannot run the state, can also do hooliganism, the same man can become the Prime Minister of the country
 jo aadmi bachapan main chaay pilaataa ho
 Became Chief Minister of Gujarat on the strength of hard work
 vikaas kaa aisa model desh ke saamne rakhe jisaki tarif puri duniya main ho, vah aadmi piem nahin ban saktaa
 'he said,' Naresh Agarwal's statement means that the son of a poor farmer cannot become PM in this country
 ek chaay bechney vaala piem nahin ban saktaa
 No one can become Prime Minister unless he corrupts like them
 unhen namo nitis ho gaya he
 They are also afraid of Modi's ghost, so they speak anonymously
 'chaay bechney vaala nahin ban saktaa pradhanmantriah naresh agarwalsapa ke mahasachiv naresh agarwal ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki ek chaay bechney vaala kabhi pradhanmantri nahin ban saktaa

 Madari also gathers the crowd
 ’vivaad khadaa hone ke baad naresh agarwal apane bayaan se palat gaye
 He accused the media of distorting the statement

 ramajaan kaa mubarak maheenaa
 Top leaders of the Congress and the eyes met with each other
 ji haa, ravivaar ko ek baar phir shahrukh or salmaan ne ek-duusare ko gale laga liya
 The same thing happened last time
 mauka bhi yahi tha or dastur bhi
 Then 5 years later both of them hugged each other by Khan
 haalanki salbhar baad hi yah mauka phir aayaa, lekin yah khaas he kyonki is bich puure saal shahrukh yaa salmaan main se kisi ne bhi ek-duusare kaa haalchaal shaayad hi liya
 On Sunday, at the Iftar party of Congress leader Baba Siddiqui, the distance snow melted again and Shahrukh and Salman hugged each other
 shahrukh se phir se gale milane ke sawaal par salmaan ne kaha, 'aisa sirf baba siddki hi karvaa sakate hai
 'still a hug, but a heart
 
 
 pichley saal bhi baba siddiki kii iftaar party main donon khan yun hi gale mili the
 Earlier, the two had a fight and the conversation had stopped
 salmaan ne to yahaan tak kah diya tha ki ab khuda hi unhen or shahrukh ko ek kar sakate hai
 Something similar happened in the Happy month of Ramadan, Allah wrote a good day's speech and the two hugged each other
 haalanki iske baad na to shahrukh or na hi salmaan ne ek-duusare se mail-milaap badhaayaa
 Even during the events, he continued to work by doing 'hi-hello'

 The work of drafting the draft of the constitution began in 1946, three years before it took its shape and one year before independence

 vaise bhi jab auraten kuch maangati hai to unki maang puri karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he lekin jab wo kuch nahin maangati to yah jaananaa bada mushkil ho jaataa he ki aakhir vah chaahati kya hai

 To this, Dhulekar stunned and said that those who do not know Hindustani do not have the right to live in this country
 ' jab kaaphi samajhane ke baad bhi dhulekar nahin maane to nehru ne aage badhkar unhen apni seat par lautne ko kaha or sadan kii garima kii taraf dhyaan dilaate hue kaha ki 'ye koi aapke jhaansi kii aamasabha nahin he jahaan aap 'bhaaiyo or bahano' kahkar oonchi awaz main bhaashan dena shuru kar den

 Some interesting things related to these meetings have been mentioned by historian Ramchandra Guha in his book 'india After Gandhi'
 prastut he us kitaab main shaamil samvidhan sabha se jude kuch rochak ansh - On 9 January 1946, the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly was held in which prominent Congress leaders Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were sitting in the front seats
 lekin kahin is baithak ko sirf congress party kaa sho na maan liya jaae isliye vipaksh ke netaaon ko bhi aage kii seat par baithaaya gaya
 a national newspaper while printing the report of the conference wrote that '9 women members had filled the color in this gathering filled with Gandhi cap and Nehru jacket
 ' Though 82 percent members of the Constituent Assembly were also members of Congress but ideologically they all held different opinions like some of them were atheists and seculars, some were technically Congressmen but spiritually RSS and Hindu Mahasabha

 In this meeting, an attempt was made to give place to every aspect of Lokmat
 britain ke lokapriy netaa winston churchill ne bhartiya samvidhan ke nirmaan par tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki 'samvidhan sabha main bharat ke ek bahusankhyak samudaay kaa bolbalaa rahegaa
 Denying Churchill's statement, the public was also asked to present its views before the constitution was put in place
 hazaron kii sankhya main logon ne apni pratikriyaayein bheji jaise akhil bhartiya varnshram swaraj sangh ne kaha ki samvidhan kaa aadhaar hindu dharm hona chahie, saath hi go-hatya or boojadkhaane band karne kii sifarish bhi kii gai thi
 At the same time, minority groups talked about protecting their rights and Dalits demanded the end of upper caste atrocities
 is tarah samvidhan ko taiyaar karne ke liye zyada se zyada logon kii hissedari maangi gai thi
 While drafting the constitution, women's reservation was also discussed, but apart from the current era, the women leaders of the time sought social, economic and political equality, bypassing the seats and quotas
 lekin mahila aarakshan ke paksh main sabase dilachasp tareeke se ek purush sadsy aar ke choudhary ne apni baat rakhi - mujhe lagata he ki hamen auraton ko ek vishesh nirvachan kshetra de dena chahie
 Anyway, when women ask for something, it becomes easy to fulfill their demand, but when they do not ask for anything, it becomes very difficult to know what they want
 agar ham unhen ek vishesh nirvachan kshetra de denge to vah usee ke liye aapas main bhidati rahengi or saamaanya chunavi kshetron se dur rahengi
 If not done, then we will have to give them the seats they do not deserve
 samvidhan sabha main sabase vivaadit vishay rahaa bhashaa jise lekar aksar sadsy zyada hi bhavuk ho jate the
 One such member, RV Dhulekar, spoke in Hindi, on which the Speaker interrupted him, saying that many people present in the meeting do not know Hindi and therefore they do not understand him
 is par dhulekar ne tilamilaate hue kaha ki 'jinhen hindustani nahin aati, unhen is desh main rahane kaa haq nahin he
 'when Dhulekar did not agree even after convincing enough, Nehru went ahead and asked him to return to his seat and pointed out the dignity of the House and said that' this is not your general meeting of Jhansi where you are saying 'brothers and sisters' Start giving a loud speech

 The police have coerced her 2 associates with her elder sister's husband
 police ke mutabik hatya kii peeche kii vajah pati-patni kaa aapasi jhagada tha
 The bodies of two girls were recovered from a rivulet in Alipur area of outer Delhi on the evening of 23 September in a mutilated condition
 police ko ek ladki ke haath main ek tatu dikhaa jisamen lucky likhaa hua tha, usee tatu ke jariye donon ladakiyon kii 24 sitambar ko pahchaan kii gai
 It was learned that both the girls were residents of Seelampur area of delhi and both were real sisters
 badi bahan 21 saal kii rukhsar or choti 19 saal kii nabila thi
 According to police, the two sisters were missing since 19 September
 police kii maane to donon bahanen 19 sitambar kii shaam ko ghar se ye kahkar nikaleen thim ki kisi ne unako naukari dene ke liye aiesabiti bas adde bulaayaa he
 Then at 5:40 in the evening, the younger daughter told that she had sat in a car and was going to Model Town, but only after that her phone stopped
 gharavaalon ne betiyon kii gumshudagi kii shikaayat silampur thane main di
 Police filed a case and started investigation
 jaanch main police ko pataa chalaa ki rukhsar kaa pati 19 taarikh se hi gaayab he
 When the police proceeded with the investigation, it was found that Rukhsar often had a quarrel with her husband
 darasal lucky nahin chahta tha ki rukhsar job kare lekin wo job karnaa chaahati thi or wo naaraaz hokar apane ghar chali gai thi
 The police arrested Rukhsar's husband Lucky based on an information
 north east jile ke disipi atul thakur ke mutabik poochtacha main gulshan urf lucky ne bataaya ki wo chahta tha ki uski patni uske saath rahe, lekin wo nahin maan rahi thi
 Also, she neither picked up Lucky's phone nor spoke to him
 bas isi ke chalate lucky ne apane 2 saathiyon ke saath milakar isaki hatya kaa plan taiyaar kiya
 Lucky calls one of his friends Shivam to call Rukhsar and give him the job
 rukhsar job karnaa chaahati thi isliye wo uske jhaanse main aa gai or apni bahan ke saath sivam ke saath car main chali gai
 Gulshan was chasing Shivam's car with another of his companions
 alipur ilaake main sivam ne gaadi ko roak diya, teenon ne milakar donon bahanon kii galaa dabaa kar hatya kii or donon kii laash ko naale main phenk diya
 Currently, all the three accused in this double murder case are under police custody
 hema malini kii kitaab 'biyond da dream girl' haal hi main relies hui he
 In the book, he has told how the distance between him and Sunny Deol was erased
 jab hema ne dharmendra se shaadi kii thi, tab wo pehle se shaadishuda the or unke chaar bachche bhi the
 Dharmendra's first wife Prakash Kaur did not like Hema at all
 kaha jaataa he ki unki vajah se sani deol or bobi deol ne bhi hema malini se dooriyaan badha lee thi
 Recently on the occasion of his book launch, Hema had told that when he was an accident, Sunny was the first to meet him
 agar hema malini ke rishte achche rahe hai to in maukon par kahaan the sani deol?hema malini ne 1992 main film 'dil aashna he' se bataur diarector debyue kiya tha
 He signed his good friends Dimple Kapadia and Mithun Chakraborty for the film
 isi film ke dauraan hema or sani ke bich kii dooriyaan mit gai thim
 In the book, he wrote - i wanted to shoot a paragliding scene with Mithun in the film
 film main ek aroplen kaa bhi seen tha, jo ek gane ke sikvence ke liye jaruri tha
 a few days before the shooting, the pilot had an accident and Dimple was very scared
 unhone yah baat sani deol ko bataai
 After this, Sunny came and met me
 maine sani ko kaha ki chintaa ki koi baat nahin he, wo surakshit rahengi
 After this we both started talking
 hema se umr main sirf 8 saal chote hai sani, 3 deol hit to 2 flopakitab main or kya he?1)raajnneeti main kaise ai :hema malini kii aatmakatha main donon betiyon isha deol or aahna deol kaa kaaphi zikr he
 All the aspects related to both daughters' childhood, their careers, marriage are mentioned
 aatmakatha main bataaya gaya he ki unhone kaise raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 The author of the autobiography Ramkamal said, "how Hema came into politics 18 years ago after BJP candidate Vinod Khanna campaigned in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha elections in 1999 has been described in detail
 isamen unke party jwine karne or rajyasabha-loksabhaa saansad banane tak kii kahani he
 The autobiography also mentions Hema Malini's car accident in 2015 prominently
 2)kaise acting kii shuruyaat hui :pehali baar aatmakatha ke jariye hema malini ke aadhyatmik jivan kaa bhi khulaasa hoga
 The book mentions that Hema Malini and Jayalalitha wanted to make a Tamil film debut together, but that could not happen
 film sin karne ke baavjood wo project aage nahin bad paaya
 Later, at the age of 16, she appeared as a heroine in Hindi films through Raj Kapoor's Opposite 'sapna Ka Saudagar'
 ek south indian ladki ke hindi filmon kii safal adaakara banane kii kahani kitaab main darj he
 Sunny does not talk to Hema Malini, such is the relationship with the sisters
 3) How much mother's influence on Hema's decisions: Producers for the films spoke to her mother Jaya Lakshmi Chakraborty, not the directors Hema
 unki maa ko yadi film main koi seen aapattijanak lagata tha, to wo use hataane ko kahati thim
 Hema Malini was known as a stylish heroine
 polka dots, oversijd salaglases, plateform hells kaa trend unhone hi shuru kiya tha, lekin filmon main wo kabhi valgar kapaden pahani nahin najar ai
 She herself was not comfortable in all these things
 4)kyon tuuti jitendra se sagaai :hema malini filmon main apana kariyar nahin bananaa chaahati thim, lekin wo kya vajah thi jisaki vajah se unhone film ko apana profeshan chunaa, wo dakshin bhartiya hote hue bhi vahaan kii industry main kyon nahin gayi- is bare main bhi aapako yah kitaab padhakar hi pataa chalegaa
 Let me tell you that by reading the book, you will know that he did not have an affair with Jeetendra, but the marriage of both was definitely fixed, but both of them had broken up due to some reasons
 bataa den ki hema is vakt mathura se bhaajapa kii loksabhaa saansad hai

 " American fast food brands have quickly carved a niche among big names like Burger King, KFC and mcdonald's and include Mumbai's Desi Vada Pav in its fast food
 agar kisi ko indian burgers—jamboking apane vada pav ko yahi kahata he—khaanaa he to vah jamboking vada pav bade chaav se khaataa he
 This really large size vada pav is very tasty as Jamboking sells this mango street food of Mumbai in flavors like Szechwan, Crispy Veg, Nachos and Corn Spinach
 vada pav ko burgers ke mukaable khadaa karne vaale shaks dhiraj gupta hai
 Seizing 20 per cent of Maharashtra's Vada Pav market — 80 per cent is still with traditional vendors — and after the success in Mumbai and Pune, jumboking is ready to step out
 is brand ko shuru karne vaale dhiraj gupta ne vada pav kaa sunaharaa bhavishya bhaanp liya tha
 He noticed that there are hundreds of vendors of Vada Pav all over Mumbai, but all are unorganized
 unhone is kaarobaar main utarane kaa faisla kar liya
 Gupta somehow opened his first store near Malad railway station in August 2001 by arranging Rs 2 lakh
 vada pav ke kaam main saamaan kii barabaadi adhik hoti he
 Gupta stopped the cost by stopping him
 isse unke paas keemten bhi kam rakhane or zyada bade aakaar kaa vada pav dene kaa vikalp tha
 Gupta adopted the second option and started giving 20 percent bigger vada paav than others
 aakaar se hi unako apane brand kaa naam bhi sujhah jamboking
 It turned out
 44 varshiya gupta kehete hai, "meraa makasad burgers ko maat dena nahin tha
 People are in a hurry at the airport or bus stop
 unke paas paise hai
 They want to eat cleanly
 par unke paas vikalp nahin he
 Jumboking provided options to the people and became a large company
 ''malad ke apane chote-se store main pehle hi din 5,000 ru
 Gupta, a businessman, took special care of cleanliness in his work
 gupta ne apane brand kaa doosraa outlet 2003 main kandiwali main shuru kiya
 By 2005, Jumboking had five outlets in Mumbai
 lekin mumbai se baahar paanv pasaarne main unhen takneekee dikkatein aa rahi thim
 The solution was found in 2007, when he met a man who supplied ready-to-fry for multinational food brands
 isse gupta kii bahut badi samasya hal ho gai
 Today, Jamboking has spread to many cities through the Vada Pav franchise
 is samay iske 112 franchise vaale outlets hai jinamein se 90 mumbai main or 22 pune main hai
 Gupta said, "jamboking is expanding our journey with Vada Pav
 17 saal se company tarakkee kar rahi he
 The basic idea was to organize Indian food so that people get good things at a reasonable price
 isamen hamen kamyaabi mil rahi he
 Gupta's focus is currently on Mumbai and Pune
 lekin aane vaale vakt main jamboking bangaluru, hyderabad, dilli, chennai, kolkata samet 8 duusare shaharon main bhi outlet kholane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 But was the franchisee able to make the model successful? Gupta explains, "you have to get involved in this
 jo nivesh karata he vah kharaab kaam nahin karnaa chahega
 There is a myth that there is no benefit in franchise
 par concept clear ho to dikkat nahin hoti
 "they say that they did not open their bakery to keep their pav size large, but they have always taken the pav from outside
" par vada pav jaisaa street food hi kyon? jawaab main ve kehete hai, "hamane mcdonalds ke sangathit rup ko dekha or sochaa ki jab america main mcdonalds orgenise ho saktaa he to hamaara vada pav kyon nahin
 "they also say that there are a lot of local cuisines in India
 ham uske liye supplai chen bana den, to inkaa bhi vistaar ho saktaa he
 Jumboking is quite popular today among youth and young professionals
 ye iske jaayke ke diwane hai
 Gupta himself is also cautious about its taste
 ve zyaadaatar field main rahete hai or apane kisi bhi store se vada pav lekar kha lete hai
 This keeps them on the taste of Vada Pav of their brand
 saath hi ve graahakon se mili feedback ke aadhaar par sudhaar bhi karte hai
 They say that they have used technology to supply thousands of vada pavs daily
 unke liye chunauti thi ki automation kaise laayaa ja sake taaki hygiene kaa bhi santulan bana rahe
 But how is the success of Jamboking Vada Pav being continued? Gupta says, "I currently have seven varieties of Vada Pav
 ek nae product par kaam chaalu he
 The product that people like less, they remove it and bring a new product
 paanch saal baad bhi ham baat karenge to hamaare saat hi product rahenge
 But they will have different variety
 '' gupta gunvattta ke jariye apane bazaar par apana niyantran rakhte hai
 The specialty of Gupta's product is clean, healthy branded Vada Pav, that too at a low price
 aaj kii taarikh main jamboking vada pav desh kaa sabase zyada bikne vaala vada pav brand he
 Gupta smiles, "initially we made a list of 50 names to name the brand
 aakhir main jamboking naam pasand aayaa tha
 This name is easy to remember
 chote bachche se lekar sabko yaad rahata he
 This brand has its own strength
 '' apane pav kii khaasiyat banaae rakhane ke liye gupta vividhta, saaf-safai or innovations kaa khaas dhyaan rakhte hai
 Jamboking continues to do something new among these three
 aakhir vada pav jaise aam street food main vividhta laakar hi to yuvaaon kaa dhyaan khinchaa ja saktaa he
 Jamboking also takes care of pockets with tongues as compared to multinational food brands
 gupta apni safalataa kii kahani ke saath is bijness main dusron ko prerit karne ke liye kuch bijness skulon or rashtriya or antarrashtriya seminaron main bhi jate hai
 Jamboking is the story of the success of a common thing like Vada Pav reaching the summit, of course, the time has come to hear it everywhere
 safarnamaking banane se pehle2001 main malad ke railway stesan ke paas choti si outlet shuru kii

 Spinradhoni, who will play a big role in the West Indies, said on Wednesday during an event, 'I think the wickets will be slow in the West Indies, but you can't say anything
 mujhe lagata he ki spinner badi bhoomika nibhaayenge
 Dhoni said he found it impressive that India now has a pool of eight to 10 good fast bowlers
 unhone kaha, ‘jitani adhik pratispardhaa hogi utana behatar hoga
 It is good that finally we have eight to 10 bowlers who are pushing for selection

 "dhoni's company had an agreement with Craig's company," the Indian captain said, "and we had bowlers who could bowl in all conditions
" agar aapako gati chahie thi, to hamaare paas thi
 If you wanted a swing, we had that too

 ' The refugees from West Pakistan, who have been waiting for citizenship for almost 70 years, are cheating themselves because the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which got votes in the name of granting them Indian citizenship, has taken a 'u-turn' today
 Is, and the reason for this is the government of Jammu and Kashmir
 darasal, rajya kii satta main bhagidaar bijepi ne pidipi ke saamne ghutane tekte hue in sharnaarthiyon ko sthaayee naagarikta die jane ke sthaan par sirf ek praaanpatr dene par muhar laga di he
 By the way, if you stay in the US for a specified period, then you automatically get citizenship there, but millions of refugees living in Jammu and Kashmir have been craving for Indian citizenship for the last 70 years
 bantwaare ke samay pashchimi pakistan se aae ye sharnaarthi sirf sansadeey chunaav main matdaan kar sakate hai, or nagarpalika or vidhansabha ke liye hone vaale chunaav main matdaan kaa adhikaar inhen nahin mila he
 They can neither do state government jobs, nor can they get the facility from the state government
 tippaniyan Now the BJP has been in power in Jammu and Kashmir for the last one and a half years, and despite promising support on every platform, it has now approved the announcement of giving domicile certificates only to the refugees instead of being made citizens of the state under the pressure of the PDP
 
 sharnaarthiyon kaa maananaa he ki unhen jo praaanpatr die ja rahe hai, ve sirf centre sarkaar ke maamalon main kaam aane vaale hai, jabaki rajya ke nagarikon ko milane vaale adhikaron se ve pehle kii tarah vanchit hi rah jaaenge
 Moreover, more than one lakh of these refugees suffered a major setback when the National Conference and Congress, which used it as a vote bank during the Lok Sabha elections, and other political parties, including the Congress, supported their opposition to the Hurriyat
 Did it
 itnaa hi nahin, bijepi ne bhi, jo 70 saal se visthapiton ke rup main rah rahe in logon ke prayek parivaar ko 35 lakh rupee kaa muawza dilaane kii maang kaa samarthan karti aa rahi thi, centre tathaa rajya main satta main baith jane ke baad muawza ghatakar paanch lakh rah janaa sweekaar kar liya

 On the last day of the 3-day lecture series of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said that private institutions have a big contribution in the field of education in the country
 bhagwat ne kaha ki nijee sansthaaon ne kai ahm prayog kiye hai or in prayogon kaa jaadui asar desh kii shiksha main dekhne ko mila he
 Therefore, to improve the level of education in the country, we need to keep taking meaningful initiatives without waiting for the government's initiative or education policy
 mohan bhagwat ne dharmpal ke granth ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki angrejon ne bharat par adhipaty ke baad ek survey karaayaa or use chaukaaney vaale aankade mili
 According to Bhagwat, it was found in the survey of British government that the education system of the time was rooted in the tradition of India
 vahiin yah shiksha paddati zyada prabhavi or adhik logon ko sakshar banane vaali thi
 Bhagwat also said that the British also came to know that Indian education was effective in making life more worthy and hence the British tried to impose their inept system on the country instead of tradition based Indian education system
 mohan bhagwat ne kaha ki aadhunik shiksha pranali main jo kuch lene laayak he use shaamil karte hue apni parampara se jo lenaa he use lete hue nai shiksha niti ko taiyaar karne kii jarurat he
 Bhagwat said that the new education policy is coming soon and hoped that everything said by him in this policy would be taken care of
 vahiin anya dharmon kii shiksha par bolte hue bhagwat ne kaha ki bharat main badi sankhya main baahar se sampradaayon kaa aagaman hua or lihaaja aise sampradaayon ke mulyon kaa bodh shiksha main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 However, Bhagwat spoke of avoiding teaching religion in schools
 bhagwat ne kaha ki shiksha main dharmon ke mul bodh kaa gyaan dena hi paryaapt he
 On the declining level of education in the country, Mohan Bhagwat said that the level of education does not decrease but the level of those receiving education and imparting education fluctuates
 bhagwat ne kaha ki donon chaatro or shikshakon ko yah baat spasht taur par samajhane kii jarurat he ki vah shiksha lene or dene kaa kaam kyon kar rahe hai
 They need to avoid taking education as a medium of income
 haalanki mohan bhagwat ne mana ki desh main digriyaan bade str par di ja rahi hai lekin research ke kaam main susti he
 Therefore, the government should include measures to promote research in new education in its new education policy
