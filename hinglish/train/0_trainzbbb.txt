 Foreign Minister surrounded by pok, Foreign Minister warned that 'geographically India will be pok' India has given a big shock to Pakistan trying to raise the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in front of the world
 videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar made clear India's stand on Tuesday and said that Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) is a part of India and one day it will be geographically in India

 Earlier, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh has also warned Pakistan

 Mehbooba, who was an ally in the alliance with the BJP till last June, also reacted sharply

 The situation in the district became so frightening that neither DM nor SSP understood it
 iskaa ilm soobe kii sarkaar ko tab hua jab ek inspector ko maar daalaa gaya
 The riotous conspiracy was unknown
 The seriousness of the police incident can be gauged from the fact that a rumor is spread

 The crowd goes to bed and the officers of the district keep sleeping

 bheed ko hamale ke liye kisne uksaaya?ilaake main philhal jabardast tanaav he
 In such a situation, the question is, did anyone incite the mob to attack? Can anyone have a conspiracy behind this form of mob? So far this puzzle has remained for the police-administration whether to consider this incident of Bulandshahr as a brunt of the sudden worsening situation or something else? The case of the death of Inspector Subodh Kumar has become more serious because he was the investigating officer in the famous Dadri murder case of UP

 yogi ne doshiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kaa bharosa bhi dilaayaa he
 But the question is, how did such an incident happen in Yogi Adityanath's government? Significantly, in 2017, when there was a ruckus in UP over the action on illegal slaughterhouses, 26 of the 44 slaughterhouses in UP were temporarily closed because they were not following the slaughterhouse rules
 puraani dilli main rickshaw chalaane vaale dharamvir kamboj ne kabhi sapane main nahin sochaa tha ki ek din vah bharat ke raashtrapati kaa mehmaan banakar us shandaar bhawan main rahegaa

 He used to take merchants to Khari Baoli area of old Delhi
 yahaan par hi unke man main is tarah ke avishkaar kii ichha paidaa hui
 In fact, the merchant he used to take on his rickshaw spent a lot on herbs
 dharamvir ko andaja lag gaya ki is vyavsaay main vah bahut paise kama sakate hai
 After an accident in 1987, Dharamvir had to return to his home Yamuna Nagar where he took a training
 us training main kheti or organic farming ko badhaava dene ke bare main bataaya jaataa tha
 In 1990, he became the first farmer to grow high-quality tomatoes
 uske baad unhone bydaree se chalane vaali spray mashin banaai
 In that machine, he installed a motor driving the tape recorder
 iske alaava unhone keede pakadaney kaa ek upkaran tathaa ganne kii fasal ko chede bagaiyr usase ganna nikaalane kii bhi mashin banaai
 The President of India had decided to honor five such explorers and Dharamvir was one of them

 Dharamveer has also developed a machine that can extract 200 tomatoes juice every hour
 2008 main neshnal innovations foundation ke pratinidhiyon ne unka kaam dekha
 After that Dharamveer thought why not make it for the general public
 dharamvir ek july se 20 dinon tak raashtrapati bhawan ke atithi rahenge

 shaadi ke baad har kisi kii jindagi badal jaati he, ye to ham sab jaanate hai lekin kya kisi aise shaks ke saath shaadi karne par bhi jindagi badal jaati he jise ham kai saalon se jaanate hai
 i often saw my friends regretting it after marriage
 haalanki shaadi ke baad unki jindagi main keval nakaaratmak badalawa hi nahin aae balki kuch acchhee chijen bhi huin
 i was the only bachelor in my group of friends and i had no other way than to listen to them
 main apane man main aksar sochaa karata tha ki meri jindagi shaadi ke baad aise badlaavon se nahin gujaregi kyonki mujhe pataa tha ki main apni garlfriend ko jeevanasathi banaaungaa
 i knew my girlfriend for the last 10 years
 shaadi ke baad main galat sabit hua
 After a year of marriage, many changes have come in my life
 1-har roj subah uthne ke baad sabase pehle use dekhnaa bahut hi khubasurat ehsaas hota he
 It is a very different feeling to see her sleeping with complete ease, without any makeup
 uske chehre par chote se nishaan mujhe uske tinager ke dinon kii yaad dilaate hai or mujhe usase or bhi zyada pyaar ho jaataa he
 Know these things about the partner before marriage 2-when we used to have a night out, our romance was different
 ab ham har roj ek-duusare ko behad kareeb se dekhte hai or ab hamaare liye shaareerik prem myne nahin rakhata
 We have become very comfortable with each other
 hamaara romance old wine ke ek glass kii tarah he jise ham dhire-dhire enjoy karnaa chaahate hai or hamen kisi tarah kii jaldbaaji nahin hoti he
 3-I would like to accept that whether you are a boy or a girl, after marriage, you start spending more and think more about the future
 meri patni ab kharch karne se pehle do baar jarur sochati he
 Now she does not expect me to bring flowers everyday, whereas when she was my girlfriend, she loved it all
 saath main baithkar future planning karnaa ek acha anubhav hota he
 Your parents hide these things about marriage
 4- After marriage, i got to see a new side of it
 jab bhi main der se ghar lautataa hum chaahe offis se yaa phir doston ke ghar se vah thodaa pareshaan ho jaati he
 Whereas before marriage, she did not say anything when she went home late because maybe i used to come home late because of her! 5-the biggest advantage of marriage is that now i am not worried about a break-up after a fight 
 jab ham date karte the to har ladaai brake-ap ke saath khatm hoti thi
 Now she has become more tolerant and mature
 ab vah choti-choti baton par hone vaali ladaai par alag hone kii sochane ke bajaae unhen sulajhane kii koshish karti he

 co / fn1igwvkhi — GVL Narasimha Rao (@GVLNRAO) October 22, 2017 What is the controversy about the film Mursal The BJP had objected to some scenes regarding GST and demonetisation in the film Mursal released on 4500 screens across the country
 iske baad khabaren ain ki producers film se sambandhit seen hataane par raji ho gaye hai
 The party alleged that demonetisation and GST are depicted in a negative manner in the film
 vivaadon ke baad bhi marsal ne 3 din main kamaaye sau karod, todaa rajnikant kaa recordarope main bijepi party ne kaha ki film main jiesti or notebandi ke bare main ‘galat jaankaree’ di gai he
 It has been told in the film that the government is taking GST, but people are not getting any facility in return
 'marsal' ke kuch dialog hataane kii maang ko dekhte hue rahul gandhi ne bhi piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi said to PM Modi in a tweet- 'mr Modi cinema is a deep expression of Tamil culture and language
 tamilon ke garv marsal main dakhal dekar ise dabaane kii koshish nahin karen
 'mr
 Modi, Cinema is a deep expression of Tamil culture and language
 Don't try to demon-etise Tamil pride by interfering in Mersal — Office of RG (@officeofrg) October 21, 2017 Indu Sarkar was a flop, a comparison with Mersal — the controversy became so hot after Nagmarahul Gandhi's tweet that These values became a national issue
 rahul gandhi ke baad purv vitt mantri chidambaram bhi is vivaad main kud pade or unhon modi sarkaar par vyang karte hue twit kiya, 'aisa kanoon bananaa chahie, jisamen vruttachitron (documentary) main sirf sarkaar kii nitiyon kii saraahna kii jaae
 'the tweet wrote,' BJP is demanding removal of the dialogue of Mersal
 aap kalpana kiijie, aaj kii paristhiti main agar 'parashakti' jaisi film relies hui hoti to kya hota
 In another tweet, he said, 'information for filmmakers: Law is about to come, now you can only make documentaries in which the government is appreciated
 'notice to film makers: Law is coming, you can only make documentaries praising government's policies

 BJP had opposed the scenes of the film and demanded its removal
 ek sthaneey sthaneey channel kii report ke mutabik aapatti ke baad mekars kuch seens hataane ke liye raji ho gaye hai
 Directed by Attlee, the film depicts the fight against the medical mafia
 ise mili-jule rivyus mili hai, lekin superstar vijay ke ection seen ko kaaphi saraahaa gaya he
 The film also stars Kajal Aggarwal, Nitya Menon and Samantha
 priy mitro, kuch saptaah kii hi baat he jab gujarat ke log loktantr ke sabase bade tyohaar, chunaavon, main bhaag lenge
 i have had many opportunities to meet you most during the last few months
 vivekanand yuva vikaas yatra, nutan varsh kii shubhakamanaayen yaa phir party kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithken
 i was delighted to see the grand vibrancy and optimism of Gujarat
 pichley ek dashak ke dauraan hamane vikaas kii jin nai oonchaaiyon ko paaya he, vah raajnneetik sthirataa ke bina sambhav nahin tha
 Many of you may have also seen the Gujarat where governments did not exist
 power hasil karne ke liye musical chair game chalata hi rahata tha
 But now all that has become history
 niti nirmaan main ekajutata or sthirataa ne logon ko labhanvit kiya he
 Political stability is the result of the vision and foresight of the people of Gujarat, who believed in development rather than anything else
 lekin, mere liye is mahanatam yogadan ke myne kuch badhkar hai- yah sachai he ki kuch saalon main gujarat ne loktantr or raajnneetik tantra main logon kaa vishwaas majboot kiya he, vah bhi aazaadee ke itane saalon baad, jab ki congress ne shashan karke ise kamjor kar diya tha
 i am asked this question many times- Modi ji, what remarkable contribution has Gujarat made in the last 11 years
 aap mujhase aisa kehane kii ummid kar sakate hai- hamane lagaataar skool drop rate ko kam kiya he, ladakiyon ko shikshit karne kaa bada kaam kiya he, vikaas kii raushnee adivasee ilaakon tak pahunchaai, garib se garib ko bhi takanic ke saath joda, gujarat ko ek audyogic centre banaaya, ham log krishi kshetra main record vruddhi ke gavaah bane ityadi
 i would like to make my point clear with an example
 1980 ke dashak main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne kaha tha ki ek rupaya jab gaanv tak pahunchataa he to vah 15 paisa ho jaataa he! is kathan ne mujhe chaunkaaya
 When Rajiv Gandhi said this, the Congress was ruled politically throughout the country
 congress panchayat se lekar sansad tak thi or ham kahin bhi nahin the
 What is proved by this thing - that the Congress has mastered the list of problems, but when it comes to the solution, we cannot expect anything from them
 aaj, main yah kehete hue gauravanvit mahasoos karata hum ki jab ek rupaya gandhinagar se nikalataa he to uskaa ek-ek paisa labhaarthi tak pahunchataa he
 The middlemen have already been reduced a lot
 system main logon kaa vishwaas bandhane kaa ek bada kaaran yah bhi rahaa he
 With the same rules and the same set-up, Gujarat has shown how qualitative changes can be brought in the life of the common man
 ham par lagaae ja rahe aaropon ko jaanakar bhi aap hairaan honge
 The charge is - 'you have built 350 schools instead of 500 schools'
 yaa 'aapane 10 kilometre kii jagah 8 kilometre kii sadak banaai he!' aaropon kaa centre bindu bhi vikaas hi he
 But, can we say the same thing to Congress friends? No! Nobody bothers to question him about development
 keval ghotaalon kii sankhya ke bare main hi unase baat kii ja sakati he
 Friends, basically the difference is just political style
 bhaajapa ne hameshaa vikaas ko dhyaan main rakhte hue raajnneeti kii he to congress hameshaa se hi votbank kii raajnneeti karti ai he
 Remember, how they separated brother from brother in Gujarat, separated friends from friends
 rath-yatra ho yaa koi cricket match, rajya main karfu laga rahata tha
 Today, if you ask a child the meaning of curfew, he or she may not know
 ek dashak ke antaraal main yah antar aayaa he
 i often say- If Congress wants Gujarat then they should leave votebank politics and take the path of development politics
 tab tak, gujarat ke log sabakuch jaanate hue unhen yahaan kii maati par pravesh karne kaa mauka nahin denge
 i have met many of our activists in the last few days and the enthusiasm and enthusiasm i have seen in them cannot be described in words
 hamaari sachhee takat hamaare kaaryakarta hai or main unhen unke saraahneey kaaryon ke liye badhai detaa hum
 i assure them that their efforts will not go in vain
 janvari 2013 se ham ek bhavy or divya gujarat kii taraf or majbootee se badhenge
 We will be celebrating another Diwali on 20 December 2012 and it will be the grandest ever
 
 
 -narendra modi Baghdadi, the kingpin of ISIS, the world's most feared terrorist organization, is now on the cusp of extinction
 iraqi sena or kurdish ladaakon ke aage bagdadi ne ab apni haar maan lee he
 In his farewell address, he has ordered ISIS fighters from outside Arabia to return to their homeland or blow themselves up with bombs
 bagdadi ye bol uski barbarta kii aakhri nishaani ke rup main saamne aayaa he
 This is the same Baghdadi, in front of whose life, fear was also being feared
 bagdadi duniya main dehshat or darindagi kaa ek jeeta-jaagta putala he
 At its behest, countless people have been killed for the last two and a half years, but there is a difference between death and death
 bagdadi apane dushmano ko jaisi maut detaa he, wo insaani soch se pare he
 Death through the sandy soil of Iraq and Syria reached the world in such a dreadful way, as never seen and never thought
 aaie jaanate hai, bagdadi or uske aatankiyon dwaara di jane vaali maut ke 10 tareekon ke bare main
 Baghdadi's 10 Faces i
e
 10 Ways of Death Baghdadi's Face Number-1 Head Pen June 19, 2016, Raqqa, Syria, This was probably the darkest day in the history of the ism's zulmo-sitam, because this day ISIS has only four One year old girl was beheaded
 vaise to iesas kii darindagi kii koi intehaa hi nahin, lekin phir bhi itani choti si bacchee kaa sir kalam karne ke peeche akhir koun si vajah ho sakati thi? to iskaa jawaab he, uski maa kaa allaah ke naam par kasam khaanaa
 The little girl came out of the house with her mother on this ill-fated date
 uski maa use ghar bhejnaa chaha, lekin taiyaar nahin thi
 She started insisting tab maa ne gusse main allaah kii kasam khate hue ye kaha ki agar wo ghar nahin gai to wo uskaa sir kaat degi
 That's all, the terrorists got so much in their ears
 phir to aatankwaadiyon ne us maa ko hi bacchee kaa sir kaatane ke liye kaha, lekin jab wo iske liye raji nahin hui, to aatankwaadiyon ne khud hi bacchee kaa sir kaat daalaa or uski maa ke haath uske khun se saan die
 Actually ISIS has been beheading enemies since its inception
 yaa yun kahen ki dushmano ko maut dene kaa ye uske sabase pasandida tarika he
 The world was shocked when ISIS beheaded 75 Syrian soldiers simultaneously for the first time on 25 July 2014
 iske baad usne thik kitne logon kaa sir kalam kiya, iskaa sahi-sahi hisaab kisi ke paas nahin
 However, the British and American hostages were seen many times in front of the camera by the world becoming victims of ISIS executioners and this trend is still going on
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-2-sir main goli maaranakisi ko ghutanon ke bal jameen par bitha kar bilkul kareeb se uske sir main goli maarna kitna bhayanak ho saktaa he, ye iesas ne duniya ko dikhaaya
 Going beyond all the limits of life, this terrorist organization shot and killed a number of unidentified people in the same head, and their treatment with their enemies is still going on
 lekin apane kuch propeganda video main to iesas ne jaise sari hadein kii khatm kar di
 Till now ISIS militants used to shoot their own victims, but now they started doing this work to innocent children too
 ji haa, kabs of kheliphet yani khilaafat ke shaavak ke naam se maasoom bacchon ko dehshatgardi kii aag main jhonk kar iesas ne usne bhi apane dushmano ko goli maravaanaa shuru kar diya
 By the way, ISIS law has its own separate punishment for every crime in the books
 lekin aam taur par jasusi ke jurm main pakade gaye logon aisi maut detaa he
 Forgive Baghdadi's face by throwing it from number-3-up
 The hands of a person are tied in feet
 wo sangeenon ke saaye se ghira he or bhaagna to dur wo apni marji se saans bhi nahin le saktaa
 He is taken to the top floor of a building in the same condition
 phir imaarat ke neeche khadey logon ke bich munaadi kar uske gunahon kii kahani sunaane ke baad use upar se sidhe neeche dhakel diya jaataa he
 This is such a scene, which only makes Rongte stand up after thinking about it
 lekin iesas ke raaj main samalangik hona, aisa gunaah he jiske liye bas yahi maut banati he
 Baghdadi's face number-4-sangarsa, to kill, to be crushed with stones
 kya kuch insaan apane hi jaise insaanon kii jaan pattharon se kuchal kar le sakate hai? aapke liye sochna beshak mushkil ho, bahut se kattar muslim mulkon main aaj bhi aisa karnaa kaanoon ke daayre main hai
 Then ISIS is ahead of all limits of hatred and bigotry
 lihaaza, iesas bhi aksar aise dardanaak tareeqe se logon kii jaan letaa rahaa he
 By the way, the victims of the association are often more women who are accused of illegitimate relationships with someone
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-5-aag main jalaakar marnapinjre main kaid ne in turki ke sainik ko jo maut di gai usne bagdadi kii ghatati dehshat ko phir se zindaa kar diya
 Baghdadi, fueled by Turkish intervention in Syria, held these soldiers in a cage before killing them
 jaanwaron kii tarah ghutanon ke bal chalaaya or phir haivaaniyat kii aisi ibaarat likhi, jise shaayad itani aasaani bhulaay nahin ja sakegaa
 These ammo straps were transported through chains and then fastened to them
 lohe kii in zanjiron main bhaagane kii koi gunjaaish nazar nahin aa rahi he
 Baghdadi's henchmen are recording every moment of fear before death on camera
 dar ke maare inkaa galaa is kadar khushk pad chukaa he
 These Turkish soldiers, who had already been bathed in petrol, were thrown into the fire of death
 kaale libaas vaale is yamraj ne maut kaa remote nikaal liya
 This remote is actually the trigger of the gunpowder that is touching their bodies passing through this iron chain
 trigar dabaa or barood ne aag pakad lee
 Momentum Momentum Death started increasing rapidly
 jindagi ne in lapaton main jhulas kar dam tod diya
 With the face of Baghdadi in number-6-boat, hardly any executioner in Marithaar has found out as many ways of death as Baghdadi gave to his criminals in this one year, the death he gave to these 6 hostages, no one else should Give
 iesas ke in darinde ne maut kaa ye dardanaak khel khilne ke liye tamaam intezaam kiye hai
 One by one they were placed in this white boat
 video main nazar aa rahaa he ki do bandhak pehle se baithe hue the or baaki ke chaar bandhakon ko ye do aatanki gardan se pakadakar boat kii taraf le ja rahe hai
 In pairs of two, these hostages were placed in the boat
 sabake chehre par maut kaa khauf saaf nazar aa rahaa he
 They know that it is impossible to escape from here, but even the hostages of the bloodthirsty Baghdadi do not get death easily
 boat main baithe behad kam umr ke in ladakon ke dil main kitni dehshat hogi iskaa andaaza laga paanaa bhi mushkil he
 His hands and feet were tied first in the boat
 phir is boat ko pani ke bich main chhod diya gaya
 The boat floated in water, death kept coming closer
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-7-pani main dubokar maaranalohe kaa pinjraa he jisase nikalnaa naammumkin he
 Small cage cameras
 isamen maut ke manjar ko ricard karenge ye krur aatanki
 One by one, 5 prisoners were sent to the cage wearing orange jumpsuits
 sabake chehron par maut kaa khauf he
 At that point, the crane brought this cage in the middle of the water and slowly the cage was started to sink into the water
 pinjadaa main pehle aadha or phir pani munh tak bharaa
 The pijada went underwater and when evacuated the mothers-in-law had stopped
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-8-visphotak baandhakar maarnajasoosi ke iljaam main iesas ke panje main aae in saat logon ko usne aisi maut di ki puri duniya tharra gai he
 These pictures of the massacre are such that it is not possible to show them any face
 khule maidan main 7 logon ko bandi banaakar laayaa gaya
 The hands of all the prisoners were tied up and tied with blue explosive wire in their necks and then ended their life with a detonator blast
 ise dekhakar to shaayad bade se bada zaalim bhi tharra jaae
 Baghdadi's face with a blast in number 9-car took the ISIS terrorists closer to death in this way
 haath bandhe hue
 Neck terrorists gripped
 ek ek karke is car main bithakar baandh gaya
 The car was locked from outside
 inhen yahaan se maut kaa safar tay karne ke liye akelaa chhod diya gaya
 Then a fully loaded mortar launcher appeared in the hands of a terrorist
 jiskaa nishaanaa car par tha
 After a gesture, the mortar went off and went straight into the car
 ek dhamaake ke saath car main baithe logon ke parakhche ud gaye
 Pictures of hanging Baghdadi's face on number 10-crucifix on Maranasuli came much from the kingdom of terror
 lekin america jasuson ko is salbagadadike aatankiyon ne jis tarah maaraa use haivaaniyat ko bhi lafzon main bayaan kar paanaa mushkil he
 The way the animal is hung after jibha in eating the butcher
 vaise hi in bandhakon ko latakaane ke liye aatankiyon ne pehle to inke haath baandhen or phir ek ek karke unhen ghasitkar us jagah laayaa gaya jahamautadi gai
 They were then hung upside down
 is tarah khaufnak maut se har koi dahal uthaa

 The Mamata Banerjee government has taken another contentious step following the decision to remove references to Lord Ram from school textbooks

 In the chapter, describing the Singur movement as 'historic', Mamata Banerjee has been described as the leader who organized the anti-land acquisition movement and gave direction to the struggle of the farmers
 adhyay main kaha gaya he ki andolan ne bahufasali jameen par lakhatkia car project ke liye factory sthapit karne kii kharaab koshish ko roak diya jiske peeche vikaas ke liye audyogikaran or rojgaar srijan kaa naam liya ja rahaa tha

 Should we not include anyone because they belong to a political party
 'majumdaar ke mutabik paathyakram cameti ne ye santulan banane kii puri koshish kii he ki puraane jameen andolanon ko bhi banaae rakhaa jaae
 In this regard, Majumdar named the Tebhaga movement
 majumdaar ke mutabik singur ko bharat ke anya jameen andolanon kii kadi me shaamil kiya gaya he
 The Supreme Court's decision came in the context of this movement which changed the century old land acquisition system
 beete saal agast main supreme court ne pashchim bengal kii purv left front sarkaar ke us faisle ko radd kar diya tha jisamen tata naino project ke liye jameen adhigruhit kii gai thi
 The Supreme Court had also ordered the state government to return the land to farmers who had expressed their desire to not give their land opposing the project
 supreme court ke faisle ko mamata banerjee ke liye aitihaasik raajnneetik jeet bataaya gaya tha
 The Mamata Banerjee government had come up with the idea of linking the Singur chapter with the syllabus since the Supreme Court's decision last year
 yahaan ye bataanaa dilachasp hoga ki rajasthan main vasundhara raaje kii aguai vaali bijepi sarkaar ne bhi haal main aisa hi faisla kiya

 It must have been a very satisfying thing to have Mahendra Singh Dhoni till some time ago
 unki bhartiya team lagaataar vishwa kii test rankigs main sheersh par kabiz rahi thi
 His brilliant innings in April led him to victory in the World Cup for the first time in this generation
 or may main unki captaini main chennai super kings ne lagaataar duusari baar ipiel kaa khitaab jeeta
 Here in England, we believe that we have become accustomed to fame, but we find it difficult to not be infatuated with Dhoni's strength and very obvious style
 aparajeyata ke is prabhamandal ne bharat ke england daure kii trasadpurn shuruyaat ko or bhi anpekshit bana diya tha
 This person with the power like Parasmani suddenly could not do anything right
 palatakar dekhen to najar aata he ki ve lords ke liye galat team chunane waalon main shaamil the or toss jeetne ke baad unhone dheron galtiyaan kin (aakhirkaar ve paanch saal main bharat ke aise pehle captain sabit hue, jo pehle fielding lene ke baad match haare) or baad main unhone is baat par rate rataae lachar bahaanon kii jhdi laga di ki unki team kyon haari
 None of these reasons highlighted the fact that the disciplined and well-prepared team of England kept them running for the entire 30 hours of the game, many of their players were not mentally competitive
 shaayad dhoni in kamajoriyon ko ujagar karne ko lekar anmane the, aakhir final dopaher main ve bhi lachar dhang se out hue the-vah ghatana, jiske baad aatmasamarpan kaa safed jhanda laharaa diya gaya, shuruaati paanch wicket 67 gendon main dhah gaye the, jisane jabardast haar kaa fatiha likh diya tha
 It is perhaps because of Dhoni's image of the cricketing semi-god that match referee Ranjan Mudugalle did not once again bring Dhoni to a more humiliating position by suspending the Indians for sluggish over speed
 pehle test ke shuru hone se pehle maha-mukaable kii ummid vaale is match or ashes ke liye 2005 kii shrinkhalaa ke ek match kii jorshor se tulana kii ja rahi thi, lekin iske baad in donon main tulana isi baat kii ho sakati he ki riki ponting ke austrailianon ne bhi khud hi pairon par kulhadi de maari thi, cardiff main bangladesh ke haathon ve shuru main hi match haar gaye the jisamen andrew symonds aise khele ki jaise koi raat bhar pine ke baad ladkadhaata he
 The reasons why India came to England with a record of remaining unbeaten for 11 series are so badly seen, but everyone has their own arguments
 aisa nahin he ki unki haar harek ke liye hairaani kii baat he
 India's staggering batting image in the fourth innings is well known and the victory over England in Chennai and Australia in Mohali has not scratched it; It is equally relevant that he had to face a lot of trouble to draw matches in Cape Town and Dominica
 khel ke shuruaati charnon main rahul dravid diwaar bane rahe honge, lekin lords main unhone ek baar phir dikhaa diya ki ve haar ke kareebi lamhon main dabaav main dhah sakate hai (chauthi pari main unke sabase taaja ardhshtak par 2006 kii taarikh he)
 After this was India's schedule, which was more tiring than the British, and we also know a few things about this break-even condition
 jo khilaadi westeindies daure ke kuch hisson se chuke nahin the, ve maheenon se lagaataar khelte aa rahe the or thake hue jarur hone chahie
 And those who were sitting out on the Caribbean tour were pushed into a heavy test match after a match against Somerset's team for preparation
 jaisaa ki zyaadaatar paryvekshakon ke dhyaan main yah baat ai ki carabian main na khilne vaale sabhi khilaadiyon-gautam gambhir, sachin tendulkar or 
 Zaheer Khan - made a nominal contribution to the Lords
 kya 
 Was Zaheer any bad luck? If you have seen in Taunton, it was not where they looked awkward, fat and they chose not to bowl in the second innings
 agar 
 Had Zaheer been an England player, he would have been given a strength and conditioning course, so that he would have come more prepared and not worse
 dhoni or coach dancan flechar ko yah lakshan us gendbaaj main najar aa jane chahie the, jiskaa choton kaa itihaas rahaa he
 The IPL has never been popular as an idea in England, as it collides with our home season and appears to be a stick of money that allows the Indian board to wipe out its co-ordinates at the England and Wales Cricket Board
 lekin ab samay aa gaya he jab bharatiyon ko thodi kadavi dawa pini chahie, ipiel unke sarvshereshth cricketron ko tabah kar rahaa he
 There is a direct correlation between the rise of IPL in 2008 and the rise in injuries to India's top stars — especially fast bowlers
 or is sandarbh main england kii team apni kismat par bharosa nahin kar sakati ki virendra sahvaag abhi tak is vajah se nahin aae kyonki ve kandhe ke oparation se abhi puri tarah nahin ubre hai, jo oparation vishwacap ke turant baad ho janaa chahie tha, lekin jise jaahir taur par bhartiya board ke ishaare par taal diya gaya tha, taaki ve ipiel main khel saken
 In his opening press conference in Somerset, Dhoni considered how India's mighty middle-order relies on the good start of his initial batsmen
 lekin na keval sahvaag nadaarad hai, balki unke niyamit aarambhik saathi gambhir ne bhi ipiel isi tarah khelaa tha, jisaki vajah se unhen westeindies daure main aaraam dena padaa
 This means that when Gambhir came to Taunton, he had not played a first-class match since 6 January
 bharat vishwa test champion hona chahta he yaa nahin? bharat us maidan par tendulkar ke sauven antarrashtriya shatak ko lekar mache jhmele se bhi thik se nahin nibata, jahaan ve apane desh ke liye pehle kabhi thik nahin khel sake
 It is fitting that Tendulkar is saluted for being able to withstand the pressure, but in situations where personal goals get more publicity than collective goals — they are also lost
 yahi baat tab bhi hui thi, jab ve test cricket main sabase zyada shatak thonkane or ran banane vaale khilaadi bane the
 It was regrettable that Tendulkar was not in excellent health, but England stood up to the challenge of bowling this legendary player
 donon pariyon main, unhen out karne kii koshish main england ne unke ran sukha daale or duusari pari main unhen tendulkar ko darasal teen baar out karnaa padaa, kyonki andrew strans ne unka kaich chhod diya tha or abujh dhang se ampaire billy bouden ne unhen baksh diya tha
 Had it not been a matter of possibility of seeing Sachin Tendulkar's century, would so many Indians have come to watch the match on the last day? And is it a good thing for the team to have such a huge halo around a player? There is no such problem with England
 bhaavnaatmak taur par or jamini kriyanvayan main, england ab ek team he jo saath milakar kaam karti he
 Even Kevin Pietersen, once a superstar, is included in the rest
 dhimi shuruyaat karne ke liye kukhyat bharat abhi bhi ubar saktaa he, lekin vah aisi team kii tarah najar aata he, jiskaa sarvshereshth daur guzar chukaa he, na ki vaisaa, jiskaa sarvshereshth daur abhi aana baaki he
 When the dust has settled at Lord's, it can be assumed that we were watching the world's number one Test team
 lekin vah team bharat kii nahin thi
 Simon Wilde is the cricket correspondent of The Sunday Times, London
 desh ke sabase puraane sainik skool ke taur par puri duniya main mashhoor uttar pradesh sainik skool (lakhanu) ke naam ko is bich badal diya gaya he
 It will now be known as Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey Uttar Pradesh Sainik School
 is sainik skool kii sthapana 15 july, 1960 ko hui thi
 The school is run by the Uttar Pradesh Government and Uttar Pradesh Sainik School Society
 skool kii funding uttar pradesh sarkaar karti he
 The school has now been renamed after the alumnus of the school, the martyr Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey
 captain manoj kumaar pandey 1999 ke kargil yuddh main shahid hue the or uske baad unhen param vir chakra se sammanit kiya gaya
 Captain Manoj Pandey is the first Param Vir Chakra winner among all military schools in the country
 kya kehete hai skool principal?uttar pradesh sainik skool ke principal karnal amit chatarji skool ke naam badalane kii kavayad par kehete hai ki yah uttar pradesh cabinet kaa prastaav he or ve sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par is prastaav ke saath hai
 They are happy with this decision of the government and the name of the school has also been changed
 nijee raay ke sawaal par ve kehete hai ki sarkari mulajim hone ke naate unki nijee raay myne nahin rakhti
 However, he adds on his part that being the oldest Sainik School out of all the Sainik Schools in the country and being the only Paramvir Chakra winner from there, it is a necessary initiative
 old bvoij association ko jaankaree nahin
 
 
 Significantly, a group of students studying in Uttar Pradesh Sainik School and coming out from there are constantly active for the betterment of the school
 association ke vartmaan adhyaksh ritred karnal samar vijay singh kehete hai ki unhen bhi is nirnay ke bare main koi shuruaati jaankaree nahin thi
 He got the idea of changing the name of the school through some other means and then shared it among the alumni group
 haalanki, ve is masale par apni ore se kuch bhi likhane se bachate rahane kii baat kehete hai
 Glad to know that
 
 
 captain manoj kumaar pandey ke chote bhai manmohan pandey se jab is silsile main baat hui to ve skool ke naam badale jane ko acchhee or jaruri pahal bataate hai
 They say that this is the decision of the government and they do not know much about it
 ve kehete hai ki ek bhai or desh kaa naagarik hone ke naate aisa kiya janaa unke liye garv kii baat he
 What does the school staff say? Mukut Singh, head physical trainer of Uttar Pradesh Sainik School, says that the school's teaching staff had no knowledge of changing the name of the school beforehand
 unhen bhi yah jaankaree akhbaar ke madhyam se mili
 However, he does not personally agree to the renaming exercise
 ve kehete hai ki kisi bhi chaatr yaa cadet kii matrusanstha ke naam kaa badla janaa uchit nahin he
 They say that there is a long list of martyrs for the country even before Captain Manoj Pandey and some competition is going on in his name in the school
 jaise captain sunil chandra ke naam par vadavivaad pratiyogita kaa aayojan hota he
 At the same time, a football tournament is being organized in the school in the name of Captain Manoj Pandey
 cadet ke taur par ajeeb laga
 
 
 An alumnus of Uttar Pradesh Sainik School and his closest friend Pawan Mishra, who wrote a book on Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey named 'hero of Batalik', says on the question of renaming the school that it was strange for him as a cadet too 
 haalanki, ve captain manoj pandey ke naam se shuru kii jane vaali kisi bhi muhim main apana shat pratishat dene kii baat kehete hai
 School alumni dissatisfaction
 
 
 uttar pradesh sainik skool ke naam ko badalane kii baat skool se padhakar nikle adhikansh chaatro ko raas nahin ai he
 They are registering their protest on this issue by different means
 skool ke purv chaatr or vartmaan main rigerv bank of india ke karmchaaree pradeep raay kehete hai ki koi bhi vyakti vishesh kisi sanstha se upar nahin hota
 Doing so is exploiting the sentiments of thousands of alumni of the school
 saath hi kehete hai ki agar aaj khud captain manoj pandey jivit hote to is raajnneetik prapanch ko lekar unka ravaiya bhi kuch aisa hi hota
 It is not acceptable to do so
 
 
 skool ke purv chaatr or old bvoij association ke liye lambey samay se karyrat amit jaiswal is faisle ke puri tarah virodh main hai
 They say that doing so after so many years of establishing the school is not acceptable from anywhere
 haalanki, ve iske babat captain manoj kumaar pandey ke mata-pita ko vishwaas main liye jane kii baat kehete hai
 They have also filed an RTI in this case and they say that the legal methods are increasing
 iske saath hi ve lakhanu ke king jorge medical college ke naam ko badale jane ke peeche kii manshaa or virodh kaa bhi zikr karte hai
 The government is increasing inflation on the one hand, on the other hand, Congress leaders want the coming budget to be populist

 In view of the next Lok Sabha elections, the Congress leaders want a budget that will give relief to the people troubled by inflation and the party will get the benefit in the elections
 congress netaa vittamantri se iskar chhot kii seemaa badhaane, sabhi ke liye ghar or garibi hataane kii skim main dhan muhaiyaa karaane jaisi maang kar sakate hai
 Chidambaram will go to the Congress headquarters on February 14, only then will he talk to the party leaders regarding the budget

 More than 828 voters of Bachham village, adopted by Rajya Sabha MP and Congress candidate from Almora parliamentary seat Pradeep Tamta, on Thursday boycotted the vote, expressing their displeasure with the BJP government in the state
 is seat par aam chunaav ke pehle charan main guuruuvaarko matdaan hua he
 The village located in Kapkot Assembly constituency of Bageshwar district boycotted the election citing the state government's neglect in development plans
 bacham ke gram pradhan anand ram ne bataaya, ‘‘hamane baar-baar rajya sarkaar ko yaad dilaayaa, apane junior ucch vidhyalay ko ucch vidhyalay main parivartit karne ko kaha lekin rajya sarkaar ne hamaari maangon par dhyaan nahin diya

 Professor David B
 Wilkins of Harvard Law School said that India has the potential to become one of the major centers of advocacy and legal education
 isliye bhartiya vakeelon ko duniya ke anya vakeelon se desh or videsh main bhi pratispardhaa se bhaybheet hone kii jarurat nahin
 Wilkins, deputy dean of Harvard Law School, who came to deliver a convocation address at OP Jindal Global University, said that regulatory barriers are necessary to the extent of development of the commercial law profession in India, but such restrictions allow long-time competition to foreign lawyers It would be wrong to assume that it can be kept away from
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ videshi vakeelon ne pehle hi bharat ke vidhi kshetra main ‘aane or jane kii niti' (asthaayee rup se aane or jane) niti se sarthak pahunch bana lee he or praudyogiki se iskaa or vikaas hoga
 Facing competition will also be beneficial for Indian lawyers
 khaastaur gat saal main isse bhartiya vidhi companiyon kaa sarthak vikaas hua he
 Wilkins said that Indian lawyers' concern about liberalizing the legal market is perhaps exaggerated
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ isamen is baat kii sambhaavna kam he kai vidhi seva dene vaali companiyaan bharat main apana karyaalay kholana chahengi or jo aisa karengi ve keval vanijyik kanoon main hi vakaalat karengi
 Wilkins said that foreign lawyers would be of little benefit from appearing before Indian courts and those appearing would also have to prove that they had sufficient knowledge of Indian law and procedure
 bharat ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke samaksh ahm maamalon main shaayad hi koi videshi yaa gharelu yachikakarta anbhavi vakeelon fali nariman, harish salve,kapil sibbal, gopal subrahmanyam or abhishek manu singhvi ke aage kisi videshi vakil ko niyukt kare
 '' kanoon ke professor ne aage kaha ki antat: bhartiya vidhi bazaar ko kholane se bhartiya vakeelon ko apane videshi samakakshon se adhik seekhney ko milegaa
 At the same time, Indian lawyers will get more incentive to stay in the country
 wilkins ne kaha,abhi kai pratibhashali bhartiya vakil desh chhodkar singapore, landan, or neuyork sthit videshi vidhi company main maukon kii talash main ja rahe hai
 It would be far better that these young men and women stay in the country and make the Indian lawyer community better
 ''haalanki, unhone kaha ki is laabh ko praapt karne ke liye bharat ko vidhi shiksha ko adhyatan karne or gunvattta sudhaarney ke liye adhik nivesh karnaa hoga
 Wilkins in his recent book, "the Indian Legal Profession in the Age of Globalization: The Rise of the Corporate Legal Sector and Its Impact on the Lawyers and Society", stated that select national law schools in India and other established institutions such as University of Delhi And some private institutions like Jindal Global Law School are imparting excellent law education to the students
 par ye santhaan bhartiya vakeelon ke chote se hisse ko hi shiksha de rahe hai
 He said, "more than 1600 law institutions in India do not provide such education
 isliye bharat ko in vidhi skulon main shiksha kii gunvattta ko sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 If this happens, there will be no goal that Indian lawyers cannot achieve

 Everything was ruined on seeing dard kii, khoff kii, bechaargi kii itani kahaniyaan ek saath or har kahani aansuon ke na thamane vaale sailaab ke saath, jitne is tabaahi main barbaad ho gaye yaa mar gayi hai usase kahin kahin zyaada wo hai jinaki haalat maut se bhi badtar he

 They all became water and water
 jo log jananath main rah rahe the or aaj bhi zindaa hai, wo sab ke sab hairat main hai ki achaanak ye kya ho gaya?ye tabaahi, ye barbaadi, ye koharaam, ye matam, ye cheekh-pukaar, ye aansu, ye bebasii or maut kaa ye manzar

 And when the areas of the area are transformed into cemeteries, when the paths leading to the floors are erased by themselves, then only one scene remains
 tabaahi kaa manjar, dard kaa manzar, bechaargi-bebarasi kaa manzar
 Ask what happened to them when they got swept away in front of them

 The fate of some misfortune is that she survived or survived, escaped the disaster in which hundreds were swept away

 This is a strange tale of painful happiness that deals with both death and life together

 hanging my clueless head in shame xxrep 4 ! - Karan Johar (@karanjohar) July 13, 2014 maujuuda border-gavaskar siries ke duusare test main bharat ke haathon mili jabardast haar ke baad australia ne ek anchaaha record apane naam kar liya he
 Now the Kangaroo team has become the most Test losing foreign team in India
 bangaleru main bharat kii dharti par uski 20veen test haar thi
 In this context, he left England behind, which India has defeated in 19 Test matches here
 bharat main 61 saal (1956-2017) ke cricket itihaas main australia ne ab tak 48 test khele hai
 Of which he lost 20 Tests, won 13, while 14 matches were drawn and one match was tied
 videshi team kii bharat main haranstralia - 20england -19newjiland- 16westeindies-11srilanka -10 The BJP, which has won the political battle of Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections, has appointed Prem Kumar Dhumal as its commander
 dhumal ke naam ke elaan ne siyaasi panditon ko chaunkaa diya he
 The reason is his age
 purv mukhyamantri or bijepi ke is vayovruddh diggaj ne apni umr ke 73 saal puure kar liye hai
 After winning the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had retired leaders who had completed their 75 years
 aise main dhumal ke naam ke elaan se sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya ye bijepi kaa avasarwaad he yaa phir chunaav jeetne par wo dhumal ko sirf do saal siem pad par rakhegi or 75 saal puure hone ke baad kisi nae netaa ko himachal kii jimmedaari saunpi jaaegi?himachal main bijepi ke paas siem candidet banane laayak kai chehre the, inamen je pi nadda jaise netaaon kaa naam liya ja saktaa he lekin mana ja rahaa he ki rajya ke jatigat samikarnon ko dekhte hue hi bijepi ne ek baar phir dhumal par daanv khelaa he
 Looking at the electoral history of Himachal, once the Congress and once the BJP government has been formed here
 is baar baari bijepi kii he
 So she does not want to let go of any opportunity
 yahi vajah he ki dhumal ke naam ke elaan main usne apane 75 saal vaade siddhant ko bhi kinare rakh diya
 Prem Singh Dhumal is currently 73 years old and will be 78 by the time he completes his five-year term
 yaheen pench he
 If BJP stays on its principle of 75 years, then Dhumal will remain CM for only 2 years
 uske baad unhen mukhyamantri kii kursi chhodani pad sakati he
 But if BJP has decided to make Dhumal the CM for a full 5 years, then it will be called its political opportunism
 75 saal ke chalate kai mantriyon ko chhodana padaa padabta den ki narendra modi jab 2014 main pradhanmantri bane to unhone bijepi netaaon ke mantri banane kii umr seemaa 75 saal tay kar di thi
 This is the reason that despite winning elections in 2014, leaders like LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi could not become ministers at the Center
 iske alaava jin mantriyon kii umr 75 saal hui unhen bhi mantri pad bich main hi chhodana padaa
 These include Najma Heptulla and Kalraj Mishra
 kai rajyon main bhi bijepi ke is 75 saal ke formule kaa asar dekha gaya
 Minister Babu Lal Gaur had to step down in Madhya Pradesh
 gujarat kii mukhyamantri anandi ben patel ko bhi 75 saal ke is niyam ke chalate hi kursi chhodani padi thi
 This is the reason why the announcement of Dhumal's name is staggering, while some experts are also assuming that the BJP has played bets on Dhumal to win the election and maybe after two years he can be removed and crowned another leader
 
 raashtrapati pad ke liye congress or 17 vipakshi dalon kii ummidavaar mira kumaar ne guuruuvaar ko kisi party yaa sarkaar kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki is samay desh ke logon par manuaadi soch thopi ja rahi he, daliton par atyaachaar ho rahe hai
 His fight is against those who impose Manuwadi thought, the presidential election is a 'battle of ideology'

 This ideology is social justice, transparency, inclusive society, to take everyone along and give respect to all religions, because our country is a multi-religious country
 " He said, "ever since the independence movement, the Congress has believed that the caste system should be wiped out, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, i personally believe that it should tie the bastion of casteism and bury it in the ground
 " Meera Kumar said that in the present era, black clouds are hovering over 'freedom of media', Manuwadi thinking is being imposed on the country and Dalits are being tortured, this is a matter of grave concern
 isliye yah chunaav vichaardhaara kaa chunaav ban gaya he
 He said, "I have written a letter to all the electorates requesting them to vote on the voice of the soul in the presidential election, i am confident that the people will be supported, because in this election even before the voice of the spirit has been cast
 " Meira Kumar arrived in Bhopal by special plane, was received at the airport by Madhya Pradesh Congress in-charge Mohan Prakash, state Congress president Arun Yadav, leader of opposition Ajay Singh and MP Kantilal Bhuria
