 ise pranab kaa jaadu hi kaha jayega ki jab unka parchaa bharaa gaya, to samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaajawaadee party bhi ek saath baithi dikhi
 a figure for which political parties were seen to bypass the alliance
 ab ise dada kaa dam kahie yaa phir unki lokapriyata, jiskaa ahsaas har kisi ko he
 That is when there was speculation about names in Raisina's race, the Congress decided to field Pranab
 ek aisa naam, jis par sahyogiyon ke aitraaj kii gunjaaish sabase kam thi
 Therefore, UPA President Sonia Gandhi announced the name of Pranab Mukherjee for the presidency
 iske saath hi desh ke sabase anbhavi or kaddavar netaa pranab mukherjee raisina kii raah par chal pade
 Citing the long political career and experiences of Pranab Mukherjee, the UPA alliance has also appealed to the mps and mlas of all parties in the country for support
 or khud pranab mukherjee ko bhi is baat kaa puraa yakeen he ki unhen har taraf se madad milegi
 The effect of time may have been seen in the last 30 years, but Pranab's style remains the same
 pranab ke bajet bhaashanon par purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne ek baar kaha tha ki bharat ke sabase chote vittamantri ne sabase lanbaa bhaashan diya
 As far as education is concerned, Pranab Mukherjee has studied History, Political Science and Law
 lekin bajet manage karne kaa kaam vah shuruyaat se hi karte rahe hai
 According to his elder brother, in childhood, the mother used to give money to bring the goods, yet Pranab used to buy sweets from it
 ek baar jab bade bhai ne poocha, to pranab kaa jawaab mila, maa paise to hameshaa gin kar detii he, lekin saamaan ko hameshaa tolti thode hi he
 Pranab still applies this method of meeting other needs by cutting down on the resources
 pranab apane teen bhai bahanon main sabase chote hai
 Born and raised in Mirati, a small village in Birbhum district of West Bengal, Pranab's father was a teacher who was also associated with the Congress
 unke pita swatantraaa senaanee the, jo aazaadee se pehle jail bhi gaye
 The elder elders of Pranab Mukherjee fondly call Poltu
 har kisi ko is baat par hairaani hoti ki pranab agar kisi cheez ko ek baar dekh lete, to vah unhen hameshaa ke liye yaad ho jaati
 That is why in today's date, his close compares Pranab Mukherjee with a walking encyclopedia
 pranab da ne raajnneeti kii shuruyaat 60 ke dashak main bangla congress se kii
 And soon in 1969 he reached Delhi for the first time by becoming a member of Rajya Sabha
 tab dilli main unki koi khaas pahchaan nahin thi or vah sadan kii pichhali line main baithne waalon main the, lekin sadan main unka doosraa bhaashan hi laajawab rahaa
 Indira Gandhi was impressed by Pranab giving a speech on the issue of nationalization of banks in a packed house and after this Indira and Pranab met for the first time
 phir 1972 main jab bangla congress tuutakar congress se ja mili, to pranab mukherjee, indira gandhi ke kareebi or bharosemand logon main shumaar ho gaye
 The next year, in 1973, he became the Deputy Minister of Industry
 tab se lekar abhitak agar apwaad ke taur par rajeev sarkaar ko chode den, to jab bhi congress satta main rahi, pranab mukherjee ke paas ahm mantralay rahe sirf grih mantralay ko chhodkar
 Pranab is often called the second prime minister due to his long political career and uncountable experiences and has also taken up the responsibilities of the Prime Minister many times, but never became Prime Minister himself
 ho saktaa he pranab da ise apni hasarat ke taur par dekhen, lekin unke parivaar ko is baat kaa jaraa bhi malaal nahin rahaa
 The son says that he has always been PM for him
 or jab mauka unke raashtrapati banane kaa aayaa, to ghar se lekar gaanv tak har taraf khushi kii lahar daud gai
 Dada reached number one as soon as he entered the race for Raisina
 jab chaahane vaale itane khush hai, to ghar waalon kii puuchhiye hi mat
 The family of Pranab Mukherjee, who holds the country's most high profile positions, remains extremely low profile
 is baat se bhi pardaa uthaa ki kabhi-kabhaar agar dada apane gusse ko lekar charchaa main aae, to iske peeche kii vajah unka jimmedaariyon kii vajah se khanpan or aaraam se hue samjhaute rahe hai
 Pranab's son Abhijeet has quit politics in politics
 pita kii vajah se raajnneeti kii dagar itani kathin nahin rahi, lekin raajnneetik rishton ko banaae rakhane kii ahmiyat khub samajhate hai
 But the question is not only to maintain political relations, but also to connect with our land, which has never changed
 raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke baad pranab jab vakt nikaalkar apane gaanv pahunche, to vahaan unka joardaar swaagat hua
 Children, old and women standing in queue welcomed them with flowers
 baat aasthaa or vishwaas kii bhi he, tabhi to gaanv ke shivmandir main is dauraan pranab da ke naam se puja jari rahi
 Pranab, who is carrying out the huge responsibilities of the country, neither forgot his village nor the villagers
 skool ke dinon ke dost rahe baldev raay bataate hai ki pranab jab bhi gaanv aate hai, unka haalchaal jarur lete hai
 Pranab Mukherjee did his schooling from Kinnarhata Shivchandra School
 or baad main isaki nai imaarat banavaane main madad bhi di
 The school has also preserved documents related to its promising student
 ricards ke mutabik 3 july, 1948 ko pranab mukherjee ne yahaan daakhila liya tha
 The school's decision is now proving right
 unke bich palaa-padhaa poltu ab pranab mukherjee ke naam se desh kaa pehla naagarik banane vaala he
 However, from the point of view, this work should have been done five years ago in 2007 itself
 lekin mana jaataa he ki kuch puraani ganthe raste kaa roda ban gai
 The Congress kept saying that he is such a troubleshooter of the party, without which it is difficult to work
 agar kisi netaa kii ahmiyat ko uski zimmedaariyon se taula jaae, to congress main pranab da ke aas−paas bhi koi nahin he
 Pranab Mukherjee has chaired 80 of the 183 Group of Ministers formed by the UPA till now
 sabase vivaadit maane jane vaale muddon jaise lokapal or telugana par banaae gaye mantriyon ke samooh kii aguwai bhi pranab mukherjee ne kii he
 And Pranab Mukherjee has always been a troubleshooter for the government
 unhen vipakshi partiyon main congress ke sabase sweekaarya chehre kaa darja bhi hasil he
 It is true that there is no match between Pranab Mukherjee's popularity among political parties, but there is definitely a screw up in his relations with the top leadership of his own party
 congressi bhi maanate hai ki sonia gandhi ne mushkil raajnneetik halaat main hameshaa pranab par bharosa kiya, lekin unhen kabhi pradhanmantri kaa pad nahin dengi
 But now times are changing
 aane vaale dinon main bataur raashtrapati unki chunautiyaan bilkul nai tarah kii hongi, lekin is baat par bhi shaq nahin ki hameshaa kii tarah vah aage bhi kaamyaab rahenge
 Pranab Mukherjee leads the race for Raisina, who has support from other parties besides the UPA alliance
 gathbandhan main agar kisi kaa virodh he, to vah naam mamata banerjee kaa he, jise lekar pranab ne abhi tak ummid nahin chodi he
 On the other hand, PA Sangma is in the fray against Pranab who has the support of BJP, BJD and Jayalalithaa's AIADMK
 lekin mamata ko lekar dotarafa khinchataan jari he
 Actually, when we talk about the presidential elections this time, the beginning has been a blast, which hardly anyone expected
 mulaayam or mamata ne jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke sujhaaye naam khaarij kar apane teen vikalp die, to desh main ek tarah se siyaasi tsunami aa gai
 Media cameras cling to the shaken relationship of the coalition government
 mamata ne to baqayada kalam ko jeet kii badhai tak de di
 It is another matter that Kalam did not approve of the race
 hakeekat to yah he ki raashtrapati ke naam par sari atakalbajiyaan tabhi tak raheen, jabatak pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan nahin hua
 Shortly thereafter, the picture began to be cleared
 mulaayam ne fouran pranab ke naam par muhar laga di
 Pranab Mukherjee's specialty has been to decide according to the situation
 khaskar kab, kahaan or kya bolnaa he, isamen bhi unka jawaab nahin
 Pranab da is rarely heard by people speaking Hindi, but if the election campaign is to be held in Allahabad, it does not make sense to speak Bengali or English
 isliye dada ne hindi main bhaashan diya
 This is the same grandfather who once said that he cannot become the Prime Minister, because he does not know Hindi
 vaise hindi aana, na aana alag baat he, par unhen bolnaa aata he, jo sabase pate kii baat he
 Despite the long and close relationship, seeing the strong opposition of Mamta Banerjee, where even the housemates were shocked, Pranab Mukherjee's very serious and nappy-tula statement came that she is like my younger sister
 maujuuda aankadon ke tahat pranab kii raah bahut mushkil nahin dikhti
 In fact, UPA has 42 per cent of the votes, including 4 from Trinamool
 4 fisadi vot shaamil hai
 If the Samajwadi Party 6 by removing it
 2 fisadi jod den, to aankada 43
 8 percent
 isamen left ke 4
 48 on adding 7 per cent
 5 fisadi vot ho jate hai
 And now 3 of the BSP
 8 fisadi kaa samarthan milane se samarthan 52
 Pranab's victory is confirmed at 3 percent
 jabaki endie ke paas sirf 28 fisadi vot he
 The comments haalanki in aankadon main thodi bahut pherbadal ho sakati he, kyonki andhra pradesh main hue upachunaavon ke nae nateezon se isamen thodaa badlaav aayega
 But the big change that will come is Pranab's status
 vaise sach kaha jaae to maujuuda halaat main pranab ke liye raashtrapati bhawan sabase makul jagah he
 With time, his patience was also responding somewhere
 is dauraan vah kai baar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar saaf kar chuke the ki ab vah aglaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Also, at the age of 77, he can no longer be a part of Team Rahul
 aise main gathbandhan kii is raajnneeti main kaaphi kam vikalp bachate hai
 And most importantly, in the current situation no one else like Pranab Mukherjee is acceptable
 ise pranab kaa jaadu hi kaha jayega ki jab unka parchaa bharaa gaya, to samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaajawaadee party bhi ek saath baithi dikhi
 a figure for which political parties were seen to bypass the alliance
 ab ise dada kaa dam kahie yaa phir unki lokapriyata, jiskaa ahsaas har kisi ko he
 That is when there was speculation about names in Raisina's race, the Congress decided to field Pranab
 ek aisa naam, jis par sahyogiyon ke aitraaj kii gunjaaish sabase kam thi
 Therefore, UPA President Sonia Gandhi announced the name of Pranab Mukherjee for the presidency
 iske saath hi desh ke sabase anbhavi or kaddavar netaa pranab mukherjee raisina kii raah par chal pade
 Citing the long political career and experiences of Pranab Mukherjee, the UPA alliance has also appealed to the mps and mlas of all parties in the country for support

 is dauraan vah kai baar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar saaf kar chuke the ki ab vah aglaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Also, at the age of 77, he can no longer be a part of Team Rahul
 aise main gathbandhan kii is raajnneeti main kaaphi kam vikalp bachate hai
 And most importantly, in the current situation no one else like Pranab Mukherjee is acceptable
 pranab mukherjee ke lambey raajnneetik kariyar or anubhavon kaa hawala dete hue upie gathbandhan ne desh kii sabhi partiyon ke saansadon or vidhayakon se bhi samarthan kii apil bhi kii he
 And Pranab Mukherjee himself is also sure that he will get help from all sides
 beete 30 saalon main vakt kaa asar bhale hi dekhne ko mila ho, lekin pranab ke andaaj jas ke tas hai
 On Pranab's budget speeches, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi once said that India's youngest finance minister gave the longest speech
 jahaan tak padhai kii baat he pranab mukherjee ne itihaas, raajnneeti shaastra or kanoon kii padhai kii he
 But he has been managing the budget from the very beginning
 unke bade bhai ke mutabik bachapan main maa saamaan laane ke liye ginakar paise deteen, phir bhi pranab usamen se mithaiyaan kharid laate the
 Once when the elder brother asked, Pranab got the answer, the mother always counts the money, but is always weighing the goods
 nape-tule sansadhano main katautee ke jariye duusari jaruratein puri karne kaa yah tarika pranab aaj bhi lagu karte hai
 Pranab is the youngest of his three siblings
born and raised in Mirati, a small village in Birbhum district of pashchim bengal ke birbhum jile ke ek chote se gaanv mirati main paley-bade pranab ke pita ek shikshak the, jo congress se bhi jude rahe
 His father was a freedom fighter who also went to jail before independence
 pranab mukherjee ko ghar ke bade bujurg pyaar se poltu pukaarte hai
 Everyone was surprised that if Pranab would see something once, he would remember it forever
 tabhi to aaj kii taarikh main unke kareebi pranab mukherjee kii tulana kisi chalate phirte inacychlopedia se karte hai
 Pranab da started politics in the 60s with the Bangla Congress
 or jald hi yani 1969 main vah rajyasabha ke sadsy banakar pehali baar dilli pahunche
 At that time he did not have any special identity in Delhi and he was among those sitting in the back line of the House, but his second speech in the House was excellent
 khachaakhach bhare sadan main bainkon ke rashtriyakaran ke mudde par bhaashan dete pranab ko dekhakar indira gandhi prabhavit ho gayi or iske baad indira tathaa pranab kii pehali mulaakaat hui
 Then in 1972, when the Bangla Congress broke and joined the Congress, Pranab Mukherjee became one of the close and trusted people of Indira Gandhi
 iske agle hi saal yani 1973 main vah udyog upamantri bane
 Since then, except Rajiv Sarkar as an exception, whenever the Congress is in power, Pranab Mukherjee has an important portfolio, leaving only the Home Ministry
 apane lambey siyaasi kariyar or beshumaar anubhavon kii vajah se pranab aksar second prime ministar kahe jate hai or kai baar pradhanmantri kii jimmedaariyaan bhi uthaai he, lekin khud kabhi pradhanmantri nahin ban sake
 Pranab da may see this as his wish, but his family was not at all disappointed
 bete kaa kahana he ki vah to unke liye hameshaa se hi piem rahe hai
 And when the opportunity came to become their President, a wave of happiness ran from home to the village
 raisina kii res main utarate hi dada number van par aa gaye
 When the loved ones are so happy, don't ask the housemates
 desh ke sabase hiprophile padon ko sanbhaalane vaale pranab mukherjee kaa parivaar behad lo profile rahata he
 There was also a veil from the fact that sometimes if the grandfather came to the discussion about his anger, the reason behind this was due to his responsibilities, catering and comfort agreements
 pranab ke bete abhijit sarkari naukari chhodkar raajnneeti main koode hai
 Because of his father, the path of politics has not been so difficult, but he understands the importance of maintaining political relationships
 par sawaal sirf siyaasi rishton ko banaae rakhane kaa hi nahin, apni jameen se judaav kaa bhi he, jisamen kabhi koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 When Pranab reached his village after taking the time to become the Presidential candidate, he was strongly welcomed there
 qatari main khadey bachche buudhe or mahilaon ne phool barasaakar unka swaagat kiya
 It is also a matter of faith and belief, that is why the worship of Pranab da continued during this time in the Shiv temple of the village
 desh kii badi jimmedaariyaan nibhaa rahe pranab na to apane gaanv ko kabhi bhuule or na hi gaanvvaalon ko
 Baldev Rai, a friend from school days, says that whenever Pranab comes to the village, he definitely takes care of him
 pranab mukherjee ne kinnarahata shivachand skool se apni padhai kii
 And later also helped to build its new building
 skool ne bhi apane honhaar chaatr se jude dastavej bachaa kar rakhe hai
 According to records, on 3 July 1948, Pranab Mukherjee enrolled here
 skool kaa faisla ab sahi sabit ho rahaa he
 Poltu, who grew up among them, is now to become the first citizen of the country by the name of Pranab Mukherjee
 haalanki kaayade se dekha jaae, to yah kaam paanch saal pehle yani 2007 main hi ho janaa chahie tha
 But some old knots are believed to have become a roadblock
 congress yahi kahati rahi ki vah party ke aise sankatmochak hai, jinke bina kaam chalanaa mushkil he
 If the importance of a leader is weighed with his responsibilities, then there is no one around Pranab da in the Congress
 upie ke dwaara ab tak banaae gaye 183 mantri samooh yani mantriyon ke samooh main se 80 kii adhyakshata pranab mukherjee ne kii he
 Pranab Mukherjee has also led the most contentious issues such as the Lokpal and the Group of Ministers on Telangana
 or pranab mukherjee hameshaa se sarkaar ke sankatmochak rahe hai
 He also has the status of the most acceptable face of the Congress among opposition parties
 yah sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ke bich pranab mukherjee kii lokapriyata kaa koi muqabla nahin he, lekin kahin na kahin apni hi party kii top leadership ke saath unke sambadhon main koi pench jarur rahaa he
 Congressmen also believe that Sonia Gandhi always trusted Pranab in difficult political situations, but would never give him the post of Prime Minister
 lekin ab vakt badal rahaa he
 In the coming days, his challenges as President will be of a new kind, but there is no doubt that as always he will succeed
 raisina kii res main pranab mukherjee sabase aage hai, jinhen upie gathbandhan ke alaava duusare dalon se bhi samarthan hasil he
 If there is any opposition in the alliance, then it is the name of Mamta Banerjee, for which Pranab has not given up hope yet
 udhar, duusari taraf pranab ke mukaable main pie sangama maidan main hai, jinhen bijepi, bijedy or jayalalita kii ediemke kaa samarthan hasil he
 But a two-way tussle over Mamta continues
 darasal is baar ke raashtrapati chunaavon kii baat karen to shuruyaat hi dhamaakedaar rahi, jisaki shaayad hi kisi ko ummid rahi ho
 When Mulayam and Mamta rejected their suggested names of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and gave them three options, there was a kind of political tsunami in the country
 gathbandhan sarkaar ke hilte-dulte rishton se media ke camere chipak gaye
 Mamta even congratulated Kalam for winning
 yah alag baat he ki kalam ne res main utarana manjuur hi nahin kiya
 The reality is that all the speculation in the name of the President remained until Pranab Mukherjee's name was announced
 uske fouran baad hi tasviir saaf hone lagi
 Mulayam immediately stamped the name of Pranab
 halaat ke mutabik faisla lenaa pranab mukherjee kii khaasiyat rahi he
 Especially when, where and what to say, they do not even have an answer
 pranab da ko hindi bolte logon ne shaayad hi kabhi suna ho, par chunaav prachaar elahabaad main karnaa ho to bengali yaa angreji bolne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 Therefore Dada gave a speech in Hindi
 yah vahi dada hai, jinhone ek baar kaha tha ki vah pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate, kyonki unhen hindi nahin aati
 By the way, coming to Hindi, not coming is a different thing, but they know to speak, which is a matter of most address
 lambey or najdiki rishte ke baavjood mamata banerjee ke kade virodh ko dekhakar jahaan gharavaale tak hairaan dikhe, utane par bhi pranab mukherjee kaa bada hi sanjeeda or napa-tula bayaan aayaa ki vah meri choti bahan jaisi hai
 According to the current data, Pranab's path is not very difficult
 darasal upie ke 42 fisadi vot hai, jinamein trinmul ke 4
 4 percent of the votes are included
 agar use hataakar samaajawaadee party ke 6
 Add 2 per cent, then figure 43
 8 fisadi hoga
 4 of the left in it
 7 fisadi jodne par 48
 5% of the votes are cast
 or ab bispi ke 3
 Support 52 with 8 percent support
 3 fisadi yani pranab kii jeet pakki ho jaati he
 While the NDA has only 28 percent of the vote
 tippaniyan However, there may be a slight reshuffle in these figures, as there will be little change from the new results of the by-elections in Andhra Pradesh
 lekin jo bada badlaav aayega, vah he pranab kaa rutaba
 In truth, Rashtrapati Bhavan is the most suitable place for Pranab in the present situation
 vakt ke saath unka sabar bhi kahin na kahin jawaab de rahaa tha
 During this time, he had met Congress President Sonia Gandhi several times and made it clear that now he will not contest the next election
 saath hi 77 saal kii umr main ab vah team rahul kaa bhi hissaa nahin ban sakate
 In such a situation, there are very few options left in this coalition politics
 or sabase ahm baat yah ki maujuuda halaat main pranab mukherjee jaisi swikayrta kisi or kii nahin he
 As far as education is concerned, Pranab Mukherjee has studied History, Political Science and Law
 lekin bajet manage karne kaa kaam vah shuruyaat se hi karte rahe hai
 According to his elder brother, in childhood, the mother used to give money to bring the goods, yet Pranab used to buy sweets from it
 ek baar jab bade bhai ne poocha, to pranab kaa jawaab mila, maa paise to hameshaa gin kar detii he, lekin saamaan ko hameshaa tolti thode hi he
 Pranab still applies this method of meeting other needs by cutting down on the resources
 pranab apane teen bhai bahanon main sabase chote hai
 Born and raised in Mirati, a small village in Birbhum district of West Bengal, Pranab's father was a teacher who was also associated with the Congress
 unke pita swatantraaa senaanee the, jo aazaadee se pehle jail bhi gaye
 The elder elders of Pranab Mukherjee fondly call Poltu
 har kisi ko is baat par hairaani hoti ki pranab agar kisi cheez ko ek baar dekh lete, to vah unhen hameshaa ke liye yaad ho jaati
 That is why in today's date, his close compares Pranab Mukherjee with a walking encyclopedia
 pranab da ne raajnneeti kii shuruyaat 60 ke dashak main bangla congress se kii
 And soon in 1969 he reached Delhi for the first time by becoming a member of Rajya Sabha
 tab dilli main unki koi khaas pahchaan nahin thi or vah sadan kii pichhali line main baithne waalon main the, lekin sadan main unka doosraa bhaashan hi laajawab rahaa
 Indira Gandhi was impressed by Pranab giving a speech on the issue of nationalization of banks in a packed house and after this Indira and Pranab met for the first time
 phir 1972 main jab bangla congress tuutakar congress se ja mili, to pranab mukherjee, indira gandhi ke kareebi or bharosemand logon main shumaar ho gaye
 The next year, in 1973, he became the Deputy Minister of Industry
 tab se lekar abhitak agar apwaad ke taur par rajeev sarkaar ko chode den, to jab bhi congress satta main rahi, pranab mukherjee ke paas ahm mantralay rahe sirf grih mantralay ko chhodkar
 Pranab is often called the second prime minister due to his long political career and uncountable experiences and has also taken up the responsibilities of the Prime Minister many times, but never became Prime Minister himself
 ho saktaa he pranab da ise apni hasarat ke taur par dekhen, lekin unke parivaar ko is baat kaa jaraa bhi malaal nahin rahaa
 The son says that he has always been PM for him
 or jab mauka unke raashtrapati banane kaa aayaa, to ghar se lekar gaanv tak har taraf khushi kii lahar daud gai
 Dada reached number one as soon as he entered the race for Raisina
 jab chaahane vaale itane khush hai, to ghar waalon kii puuchhiye hi mat
 The family of Pranab Mukherjee, who holds the country's most high profile positions, remains extremely low profile
 is baat se bhi pardaa uthaa ki kabhi-kabhaar agar dada apane gusse ko lekar charchaa main aae, to iske peeche kii vajah unka jimmedaariyon kii vajah se khanpan or aaraam se hue samjhaute rahe hai
 Pranab's son Abhijeet has quit politics in politics
 pita kii vajah se raajnneeti kii dagar itani kathin nahin rahi, lekin raajnneetik rishton ko banaae rakhane kii ahmiyat khub samajhate hai
 But the question is not only to maintain political relations, but also to connect with our land, which has never changed
 raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke baad pranab jab vakt nikaalkar apane gaanv pahunche, to vahaan unka joardaar swaagat hua
 Children, old and women standing in queue welcomed them with flowers
 baat aasthaa or vishwaas kii bhi he, tabhi to gaanv ke shivmandir main is dauraan pranab da ke naam se puja jari rahi
 Pranab, who is carrying out the huge responsibilities of the country, neither forgot his village nor the villagers
 skool ke dinon ke dost rahe baldev raay bataate hai ki pranab jab bhi gaanv aate hai, unka haalchaal jarur lete hai
 Pranab Mukherjee did his schooling from Kinnarhata Shivchandra School
 or baad main isaki nai imaarat banavaane main madad bhi di
 The school has also preserved documents related to its promising student
 ricards ke mutabik 3 july, 1948 ko pranab mukherjee ne yahaan daakhila liya tha
 The school's decision is now proving right
 unke bich palaa-padhaa poltu ab pranab mukherjee ke naam se desh kaa pehla naagarik banane vaala he
 However, from the point of view, this work should have been done five years ago in 2007 itself
 lekin mana jaataa he ki kuch puraani ganthe raste kaa roda ban gai
 The Congress kept saying that he is such a troubleshooter of the party, without which it is difficult to work
 agar kisi netaa kii ahmiyat ko uski zimmedaariyon se taula jaae, to congress main pranab da ke aas−paas bhi koi nahin he
 Pranab Mukherjee has chaired 80 of the 183 Group of Ministers formed by the UPA till now
 sabase vivaadit maane jane vaale muddon jaise lokapal or telugana par banaae gaye mantriyon ke samooh kii aguwai bhi pranab mukherjee ne kii he
 And Pranab Mukherjee has always been a troubleshooter for the government
 unhen vipakshi partiyon main congress ke sabase sweekaarya chehre kaa darja bhi hasil he
 It is true that there is no match between Pranab Mukherjee's popularity among political parties, but there is definitely a screw up in his relations with the top leadership of his own party
 congressi bhi maanate hai ki sonia gandhi ne mushkil raajnneetik halaat main hameshaa pranab par bharosa kiya, lekin unhen kabhi pradhanmantri kaa pad nahin dengi
 But now times are changing
 aane vaale dinon main bataur raashtrapati unki chunautiyaan bilkul nai tarah kii hongi, lekin is baat par bhi shaq nahin ki hameshaa kii tarah vah aage bhi kaamyaab rahenge
 Pranab Mukherjee leads the race for Raisina, who has support from other parties besides the UPA alliance
 gathbandhan main agar kisi kaa virodh he, to vah naam mamata banerjee kaa he, jise lekar pranab ne abhi tak ummid nahin chodi he
 On the other hand, PA Sangma is in the fray against Pranab who has the support of BJP, BJD and Jayalalithaa's AIADMK
 lekin mamata ko lekar dotarafa khinchataan jari he
 Actually, when we talk about the presidential elections this time, the beginning has been a blast, which hardly anyone expected
 mulaayam or mamata ne jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke sujhaaye naam khaarij kar apane teen vikalp die, to desh main ek tarah se siyaasi tsunami aa gai
 Media cameras cling to the shaken relationship of the coalition government
 mamata ne to baqayada kalam ko jeet kii badhai tak de di
 It is another matter that Kalam did not approve of the race
 hakeekat to yah he ki raashtrapati ke naam par sari atakalbajiyaan tabhi tak raheen, jabatak pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan nahin hua
 Shortly thereafter, the picture began to be cleared
 mulaayam ne fouran pranab ke naam par muhar laga di
 Pranab Mukherjee's specialty has been to decide according to the situation
 khaskar kab, kahaan or kya bolnaa he, isamen bhi unka jawaab nahin
 Pranab da is rarely heard by people speaking Hindi, but if the election campaign is to be held in Allahabad, it does not make sense to speak Bengali or English
 isliye dada ne hindi main bhaashan diya
 This is the same grandfather who once said that he cannot become the Prime Minister, because he does not know Hindi
 vaise hindi aana, na aana alag baat he, par unhen bolnaa aata he, jo sabase pate kii baat he
 Despite the long and close relationship, seeing the strong opposition of Mamta Banerjee, where even the housemates were shocked, Pranab Mukherjee's very serious and nappy-tula statement came that she is like my younger sister
 maujuuda aankadon ke tahat pranab kii raah bahut mushkil nahin dikhti
 In fact, UPA has 42 per cent of the votes, including 4 from Trinamool
 4 fisadi vot shaamil hai
 If the Samajwadi Party 6 by removing it
 2 fisadi jod den, to aankada 43
 8 percent
 isamen left ke 4
 48 on adding 7 per cent
 5 fisadi vot ho jate hai
 And now 3 of the BSP
 8 fisadi kaa samarthan milane se samarthan 52
 Pranab's victory is confirmed at 3 percent
 jabaki endie ke paas sirf 28 fisadi vot he
 The comments haalanki in aankadon main thodi bahut pherbadal ho sakati he, kyonki andhra pradesh main hue upachunaavon ke nae nateezon se isamen thodaa badlaav aayega
 But the big change that will come is Pranab's status
 vaise sach kaha jaae to maujuuda halaat main pranab ke liye raashtrapati bhawan sabase makul jagah he
 With time, his patience was also responding somewhere
 is dauraan vah kai baar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar saaf kar chuke the ki ab vah aglaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Also, at the age of 77, he can no longer be a part of Team Rahul

 pranab mukherjee ko ghar ke bade bujurg pyaar se poltu pukaarte hai

 or jab mauka unke raashtrapati banane kaa aayaa, to ghar se lekar gaanv tak har taraf khushi kii lahar daud gai
 Dada reached number one as soon as he entered the race for Raisina
 jab chaahane vaale itane khush hai, to ghar waalon kii puuchhiye hi mat
 The family of Pranab Mukherjee, who holds the country's most high profile positions, remains extremely low profile
 is baat se bhi pardaa uthaa ki kabhi-kabhaar agar dada apane gusse ko lekar charchaa main aae, to iske peeche kii vajah unka jimmedaariyon kii vajah se khanpan or aaraam se hue samjhaute rahe hai
 Pranab's son Abhijeet has quit politics in politics
 pita kii vajah se raajnneeti kii dagar itani kathin nahin rahi, lekin raajnneetik rishton ko banaae rakhane kii ahmiyat khub samajhate hai
 But the question is not only to maintain political relations, but also to connect with our land, which has never changed
 raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke baad pranab jab vakt nikaalkar apane gaanv pahunche, to vahaan unka joardaar swaagat hua
 Children, old and women standing in queue welcomed them with flowers
 baat aasthaa or vishwaas kii bhi he, tabhi to gaanv ke shivmandir main is dauraan pranab da ke naam se puja jari rahi
 Pranab, who is carrying out the huge responsibilities of the country, neither forgot his village nor the villagers
 skool ke dinon ke dost rahe baldev raay bataate hai ki pranab jab bhi gaanv aate hai, unka haalchaal jarur lete hai
 Pranab Mukherjee did his schooling from Kinnarhata Shivchandra School
 or baad main isaki nai imaarat banavaane main madad bhi di
 The school has also preserved documents related to its promising student

 The school's decision is now proving right
 unke bich palaa-padhaa poltu ab pranab mukherjee ke naam se desh kaa pehla naagarik banane vaala he
 However, from the point of view, this work should have been done five years ago in 2007 itself
 lekin mana jaataa he ki kuch puraani ganthe raste kaa roda ban gai
 The Congress kept saying that he is such a troubleshooter of the party, without which it is difficult to work
 agar kisi netaa kii ahmiyat ko uski zimmedaariyon se taula jaae, to congress main pranab da ke aas−paas bhi koi nahin he
 Pranab Mukherjee has chaired 80 of the 183 Group of Ministers formed by the UPA till now
 sabase vivaadit maane jane vaale muddon jaise lokapal or telugana par banaae gaye mantriyon ke samooh kii aguwai bhi pranab mukherjee ne kii he
 And Pranab Mukherjee has always been a troubleshooter for the government
 unhen vipakshi partiyon main congress ke sabase sweekaarya chehre kaa darja bhi hasil he
 It is true that there is no match between Pranab Mukherjee's popularity among political parties, but there is definitely a screw up in his relations with the top leadership of his own party
 congressi bhi maanate hai ki sonia gandhi ne mushkil raajnneetik halaat main hameshaa pranab par bharosa kiya, lekin unhen kabhi pradhanmantri kaa pad nahin dengi
 But now times are changing

 Pranab Mukherjee leads the race for Raisina, who has support from other parties besides the UPA alliance
 gathbandhan main agar kisi kaa virodh he, to vah naam mamata banerjee kaa he, jise lekar pranab ne abhi tak ummid nahin chodi he
 On the other hand, PA Sangma is in the fray against Pranab who has the support of BJP, BJD and Jayalalithaa's AIADMK

 Actually, when we talk about the presidential elections this time, the beginning has been a blast, which hardly anyone expected

 tab dilli main unki koi khaas pahchaan nahin thi or vah sadan kii pichhali line main baithne waalon main the, lekin sadan main unka doosraa bhaashan hi laajawab rahaa
 Indira Gandhi was impressed by Pranab giving a speech on the issue of nationalization of banks in a packed house and after this Indira and Pranab met for the first time

 And most importantly, in the current situation no one else like Pranab Mukherjee is acceptable
 apane lambey siyaasi kariyar or beshumaar anubhavon kii vajah se pranab aksar second prime ministar kahe jate hai or kai baar pradhanmantri kii jimmedaariyaan bhi uthaai he, lekin khud kabhi pradhanmantri nahin ban sake
 Pranab da may see this as his wish, but his family was not at all disappointed
 bete kaa kahana he ki vah to unke liye hameshaa se hi piem rahe hai
 And when the opportunity came to become their President, a wave of happiness ran from home to the village
 raisina kii res main utarate hi dada number van par aa gaye
 When the loved ones are so happy, don't ask the housemates
 desh ke sabase hiprophile padon ko sanbhaalane vaale pranab mukherjee kaa parivaar behad lo profile rahata he
 There was also a veil from the fact that sometimes if the grandfather came to the discussion about his anger, the reason behind this was due to his responsibilities, catering and comfort agreements
 pranab ke bete abhijit sarkari naukari chhodkar raajnneeti main koode hai
 Because of his father, the path of politics has not been so difficult, but he understands the importance of maintaining political relationships
 par sawaal sirf siyaasi rishton ko banaae rakhane kaa hi nahin, apni jameen se judaav kaa bhi he, jisamen kabhi koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 When Pranab reached his village after taking the time to become the Presidential candidate, he was strongly welcomed there
 qatari main khadey bachche buudhe or mahilaon ne phool barasaakar unka swaagat kiya
 It is also a matter of faith and belief, that is why the worship of Pranab da continued during this time in the Shiv temple of the village
 desh kii badi jimmedaariyaan nibhaa rahe pranab na to apane gaanv ko kabhi bhuule or na hi gaanvvaalon ko
 Baldev Rai, a friend from school days, says that whenever Pranab comes to the village, he definitely takes care of him
 pranab mukherjee ne kinnarahata shivachand skool se apni padhai kii
 And later also helped to build its new building
 skool ne bhi apane honhaar chaatr se jude dastavej bachaa kar rakhe hai
 According to records, on 3 July 1948, Pranab Mukherjee enrolled here
 skool kaa faisla ab sahi sabit ho rahaa he
 Poltu, who grew up among them, is now to become the first citizen of the country by the name of Pranab Mukherjee
 haalanki kaayade se dekha jaae, to yah kaam paanch saal pehle yani 2007 main hi ho janaa chahie tha
 But some old knots are believed to have become a roadblock
 congress yahi kahati rahi ki vah party ke aise sankatmochak hai, jinke bina kaam chalanaa mushkil he
 If the importance of a leader is weighed with his responsibilities, then there is no one around Pranab da in the Congress
 upie ke dwaara ab tak banaae gaye 183 mantri samooh yani mantriyon ke samooh main se 80 kii adhyakshata pranab mukherjee ne kii he
 Pranab Mukherjee has also led the most contentious issues such as the Lokpal and the Group of Ministers on Telangana
 or pranab mukherjee hameshaa se sarkaar ke sankatmochak rahe hai
 He also has the status of the most acceptable face of the Congress among opposition parties
 yah sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ke bich pranab mukherjee kii lokapriyata kaa koi muqabla nahin he, lekin kahin na kahin apni hi party kii top leadership ke saath unke sambadhon main koi pench jarur rahaa he
 Congressmen also believe that Sonia Gandhi always trusted Pranab in difficult political situations, but would never give him the post of Prime Minister
 lekin ab vakt badal rahaa he
 In the coming days, his challenges as President will be of a new kind, but there is no doubt that as always he will succeed
 raisina kii res main pranab mukherjee sabase aage hai, jinhen upie gathbandhan ke alaava duusare dalon se bhi samarthan hasil he
 If there is any opposition in the alliance, then it is the name of Mamta Banerjee, for which Pranab has not given up hope yet
 udhar, duusari taraf pranab ke mukaable main pie sangama maidan main hai, jinhen bijepi, bijedy or jayalalita kii ediemke kaa samarthan hasil he
 But a two-way tussle over Mamta continues
 darasal is baar ke raashtrapati chunaavon kii baat karen to shuruyaat hi dhamaakedaar rahi, jisaki shaayad hi kisi ko ummid rahi ho
 When Mulayam and Mamta rejected their suggested names of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and gave them three options, there was a kind of political tsunami in the country
 gathbandhan sarkaar ke hilte-dulte rishton se media ke camere chipak gaye
 Mamta even congratulated Kalam for winning
 yah alag baat he ki kalam ne res main utarana manjuur hi nahin kiya
 The reality is that all the speculation in the name of the President remained until Pranab Mukherjee's name was announced
 uske fouran baad hi tasviir saaf hone lagi
 Mulayam immediately stamped the name of Pranab
 halaat ke mutabik faisla lenaa pranab mukherjee kii khaasiyat rahi he
 Especially when, where and what to say, they do not even have an answer
 pranab da ko hindi bolte logon ne shaayad hi kabhi suna ho, par chunaav prachaar elahabaad main karnaa ho to bengali yaa angreji bolne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 Therefore Dada gave a speech in Hindi
 yah vahi dada hai, jinhone ek baar kaha tha ki vah pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate, kyonki unhen hindi nahin aati
 By the way, coming to Hindi, not coming is a different thing, but they know to speak, which is a matter of most address
 lambey or najdiki rishte ke baavjood mamata banerjee ke kade virodh ko dekhakar jahaan gharavaale tak hairaan dikhe, utane par bhi pranab mukherjee kaa bada hi sanjeeda or napa-tula bayaan aayaa ki vah meri choti bahan jaisi hai
 According to the current data, Pranab's path is not very difficult
 darasal upie ke 42 fisadi vot hai, jinamein trinmul ke 4
 4 percent of the votes are included
 agar use hataakar samaajawaadee party ke 6
 Add 2 per cent, then figure 43
 8 fisadi hoga
 4 of the left in it
 7 fisadi jodne par 48
 5% of the votes are cast
 or ab bispi ke 3
 Support 52 with 8 percent support
 3 fisadi yani pranab kii jeet pakki ho jaati he
 While the NDA has only 28 percent of the vote
 tippaniyan However, there may be a slight reshuffle in these figures, as there will be little change from the new results of the by-elections in Andhra Pradesh
 lekin jo bada badlaav aayega, vah he pranab kaa rutaba
 In truth, Rashtrapati Bhavan is the most suitable place for Pranab in the present situation
 vakt ke saath unka sabar bhi kahin na kahin jawaab de rahaa tha
 During this time, he had met Congress President Sonia Gandhi several times and made it clear that now he will not contest the next election
 saath hi 77 saal kii umr main ab vah team rahul kaa bhi hissaa nahin ban sakate
 In such a situation, there are very few options left in this coalition politics
 or sabase ahm baat yah ki maujuuda halaat main pranab mukherjee jaisi swikayrta kisi or kii nahin he
 Dada reached number one as soon as he entered the race for Raisina
 jab chaahane vaale itane khush hai, to ghar waalon kii puuchhiye hi mat
 The family of Pranab Mukherjee, who holds the country's most high profile positions, remains extremely low profile
 is baat se bhi pardaa uthaa ki kabhi-kabhaar agar dada apane gusse ko lekar charchaa main aae, to iske peeche kii vajah unka jimmedaariyon kii vajah se khanpan or aaraam se hue samjhaute rahe hai
 Pranab's son Abhijeet has quit politics in politics
 pita kii vajah se raajnneeti kii dagar itani kathin nahin rahi, lekin raajnneetik rishton ko banaae rakhane kii ahmiyat khub samajhate hai
 But the question is not only to maintain political relations, but also to connect with our land, which has never changed
 raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke baad pranab jab vakt nikaalkar apane gaanv pahunche, to vahaan unka joardaar swaagat hua
 Children, old and women standing in queue welcomed them with flowers
 baat aasthaa or vishwaas kii bhi he, tabhi to gaanv ke shivmandir main is dauraan pranab da ke naam se puja jari rahi
 Pranab, who is carrying out the huge responsibilities of the country, neither forgot his village nor the villagers
 skool ke dinon ke dost rahe baldev raay bataate hai ki pranab jab bhi gaanv aate hai, unka haalchaal jarur lete hai
 Pranab Mukherjee did his schooling from Kinnarhata Shivchandra School
 or baad main isaki nai imaarat banavaane main madad bhi di
 The school has also preserved documents related to its promising student
 ricards ke mutabik 3 july, 1948 ko pranab mukherjee ne yahaan daakhila liya tha
 The school's decision is now proving right
 unke bich palaa-padhaa poltu ab pranab mukherjee ke naam se desh kaa pehla naagarik banane vaala he
 However, from the point of view, this work should have been done five years ago in 2007 itself
 lekin mana jaataa he ki kuch puraani ganthe raste kaa roda ban gai
 The Congress kept saying that he is such a troubleshooter of the party, without which it is difficult to work
 agar kisi netaa kii ahmiyat ko uski zimmedaariyon se taula jaae, to congress main pranab da ke aas−paas bhi koi nahin he
 Pranab Mukherjee has chaired 80 of the 183 Group of Ministers formed by the UPA till now
 sabase vivaadit maane jane vaale muddon jaise lokapal or telugana par banaae gaye mantriyon ke samooh kii aguwai bhi pranab mukherjee ne kii he
 And Pranab Mukherjee has always been a troubleshooter for the government
 unhen vipakshi partiyon main congress ke sabase sweekaarya chehre kaa darja bhi hasil he
 It is true that there is no match between Pranab Mukherjee's popularity among political parties, but there is definitely a screw up in his relations with the top leadership of his own party
 congressi bhi maanate hai ki sonia gandhi ne mushkil raajnneetik halaat main hameshaa pranab par bharosa kiya, lekin unhen kabhi pradhanmantri kaa pad nahin dengi
 But now times are changing
 aane vaale dinon main bataur raashtrapati unki chunautiyaan bilkul nai tarah kii hongi, lekin is baat par bhi shaq nahin ki hameshaa kii tarah vah aage bhi kaamyaab rahenge
 Pranab Mukherjee leads the race for Raisina, who has support from other parties besides the UPA alliance
 gathbandhan main agar kisi kaa virodh he, to vah naam mamata banerjee kaa he, jise lekar pranab ne abhi tak ummid nahin chodi he
 On the other hand, PA Sangma is in the fray against Pranab who has the support of BJP, BJD and Jayalalithaa's AIADMK
 lekin mamata ko lekar dotarafa khinchataan jari he
 Actually, when we talk about the presidential elections this time, the beginning has been a blast, which hardly anyone expected
 mulaayam or mamata ne jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke sujhaaye naam khaarij kar apane teen vikalp die, to desh main ek tarah se siyaasi tsunami aa gai
 Media cameras cling to the shaken relationship of the coalition government
 mamata ne to baqayada kalam ko jeet kii badhai tak de di
 It is another matter that Kalam did not approve of the race
 hakeekat to yah he ki raashtrapati ke naam par sari atakalbajiyaan tabhi tak raheen, jabatak pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan nahin hua
 Shortly thereafter, the picture began to be cleared
 mulaayam ne fouran pranab ke naam par muhar laga di
 Pranab Mukherjee's specialty has been to decide according to the situation
 khaskar kab, kahaan or kya bolnaa he, isamen bhi unka jawaab nahin
 Pranab da is rarely heard by people speaking Hindi, but if the election campaign is to be held in Allahabad, it does not make sense to speak Bengali or English
 isliye dada ne hindi main bhaashan diya
 This is the same grandfather who once said that he cannot become the Prime Minister, because he does not know Hindi
 vaise hindi aana, na aana alag baat he, par unhen bolnaa aata he, jo sabase pate kii baat he
 Despite the long and close relationship, seeing the strong opposition of Mamta Banerjee, where even the housemates were shocked, Pranab Mukherjee's very serious and nappy-tula statement came that she is like my younger sister
 maujuuda aankadon ke tahat pranab kii raah bahut mushkil nahin dikhti
 In fact, UPA has 42 per cent of the votes, including 4 from Trinamool
 4 fisadi vot shaamil hai
 If the Samajwadi Party 6 by removing it
 2 fisadi jod den, to aankada 43
 8 percent
 isamen left ke 4
 48 on adding 7 per cent
 5 fisadi vot ho jate hai
 And now 3 of the BSP
 8 fisadi kaa samarthan milane se samarthan 52
 Pranab's victory is confirmed at 3 percent
 jabaki endie ke paas sirf 28 fisadi vot he
 The comments haalanki in aankadon main thodi bahut pherbadal ho sakati he, kyonki andhra pradesh main hue upachunaavon ke nae nateezon se isamen thodaa badlaav aayega
 But the big change that will come is Pranab's status
 vaise sach kaha jaae to maujuuda halaat main pranab ke liye raashtrapati bhawan sabase makul jagah he
 With time, his patience was also responding somewhere
 is dauraan vah kai baar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar saaf kar chuke the ki ab vah aglaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Also, at the age of 77, he can no longer be a part of Team Rahul
 aise main gathbandhan kii is raajnneeti main kaaphi kam vikalp bachate hai
 And most importantly, in the current situation no one else like Pranab Mukherjee is acceptable
 par sawaal sirf siyaasi rishton ko banaae rakhane kaa hi nahin, apni jameen se judaav kaa bhi he, jisamen kabhi koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 When Pranab reached his village after taking the time to become the Presidential candidate, he was strongly welcomed there
 qatari main khadey bachche buudhe or mahilaon ne phool barasaakar unka swaagat kiya
 It is also a matter of faith and belief, that is why the worship of Pranab da continued during this time in the Shiv temple of the village
 desh kii badi jimmedaariyaan nibhaa rahe pranab na to apane gaanv ko kabhi bhuule or na hi gaanvvaalon ko
 Baldev Rai, a friend from school days, says that whenever Pranab comes to the village, he definitely takes care of him
 pranab mukherjee ne kinnarahata shivachand skool se apni padhai kii
 And later also helped to build its new building
 skool ne bhi apane honhaar chaatr se jude dastavej bachaa kar rakhe hai
 According to records, on 3 July 1948, Pranab Mukherjee enrolled here
 skool kaa faisla ab sahi sabit ho rahaa he
 Poltu, who grew up among them, is now to become the first citizen of the country by the name of Pranab Mukherjee
 haalanki kaayade se dekha jaae, to yah kaam paanch saal pehle yani 2007 main hi ho janaa chahie tha
 But some old knots are believed to have become a roadblock
 congress yahi kahati rahi ki vah party ke aise sankatmochak hai, jinke bina kaam chalanaa mushkil he
 If the importance of a leader is weighed with his responsibilities, then there is no one around Pranab da in the Congress
 upie ke dwaara ab tak banaae gaye 183 mantri samooh yani mantriyon ke samooh main se 80 kii adhyakshata pranab mukherjee ne kii he
 Pranab Mukherjee has also led the most contentious issues such as the Lokpal and the Group of Ministers on Telangana
 or pranab mukherjee hameshaa se sarkaar ke sankatmochak rahe hai
 He also has the status of the most acceptable face of the Congress among opposition parties
 yah sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ke bich pranab mukherjee kii lokapriyata kaa koi muqabla nahin he, lekin kahin na kahin apni hi party kii top leadership ke saath unke sambadhon main koi pench jarur rahaa he
 Congressmen also believe that Sonia Gandhi always trusted Pranab in difficult political situations, but would never give him the post of Prime Minister
 lekin ab vakt badal rahaa he
 In the coming days, his challenges as President will be of a new kind, but there is no doubt that as always he will succeed
 raisina kii res main pranab mukherjee sabase aage hai, jinhen upie gathbandhan ke alaava duusare dalon se bhi samarthan hasil he
 If there is any opposition in the alliance, then it is the name of Mamta Banerjee, for which Pranab has not given up hope yet
 udhar, duusari taraf pranab ke mukaable main pie sangama maidan main hai, jinhen bijepi, bijedy or jayalalita kii ediemke kaa samarthan hasil he
 But a two-way tussle over Mamta continues
 darasal is baar ke raashtrapati chunaavon kii baat karen to shuruyaat hi dhamaakedaar rahi, jisaki shaayad hi kisi ko ummid rahi ho
 When Mulayam and Mamta rejected their suggested names of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and gave them three options, there was a kind of political tsunami in the country
 gathbandhan sarkaar ke hilte-dulte rishton se media ke camere chipak gaye
 Mamta even congratulated Kalam for winning
 yah alag baat he ki kalam ne res main utarana manjuur hi nahin kiya
 The reality is that all the speculation in the name of the President remained until Pranab Mukherjee's name was announced
 uske fouran baad hi tasviir saaf hone lagi
 Mulayam immediately stamped the name of Pranab
 halaat ke mutabik faisla lenaa pranab mukherjee kii khaasiyat rahi he
 Especially when, where and what to say, they do not even have an answer
 pranab da ko hindi bolte logon ne shaayad hi kabhi suna ho, par chunaav prachaar elahabaad main karnaa ho to bengali yaa angreji bolne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 Therefore Dada gave a speech in Hindi
 yah vahi dada hai, jinhone ek baar kaha tha ki vah pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate, kyonki unhen hindi nahin aati
 By the way, coming to Hindi, not coming is a different thing, but they know to speak, which is a matter of most address
 lambey or najdiki rishte ke baavjood mamata banerjee ke kade virodh ko dekhakar jahaan gharavaale tak hairaan dikhe, utane par bhi pranab mukherjee kaa bada hi sanjeeda or napa-tula bayaan aayaa ki vah meri choti bahan jaisi hai
 According to the current data, Pranab's path is not very difficult
 darasal upie ke 42 fisadi vot hai, jinamein trinmul ke 4
 4 percent of the votes are included
 agar use hataakar samaajawaadee party ke 6
 Add 2 per cent, then figure 43
 8 fisadi hoga
 4 of the left in it
 7 fisadi jodne par 48
 5% of the votes are cast
 or ab bispi ke 3
 Support 52 with 8 percent support
 3 fisadi yani pranab kii jeet pakki ho jaati he
 While the NDA has only 28 percent of the vote
 tippaniyan However, there may be a slight reshuffle in these figures, as there will be little change from the new results of the by-elections in Andhra Pradesh
 lekin jo bada badlaav aayega, vah he pranab kaa rutaba
 In truth, Rashtrapati Bhavan is the most suitable place for Pranab in the present situation
 vakt ke saath unka sabar bhi kahin na kahin jawaab de rahaa tha
 During this time, he had met Congress President Sonia Gandhi several times and made it clear that now he will not contest the next election
 saath hi 77 saal kii umr main ab vah team rahul kaa bhi hissaa nahin ban sakate
 In such a situation, there are very few options left in this coalition politics

 According to the current data, Pranab's path is not very difficult

 3 fisadi yani pranab kii jeet pakki ho jaati he
 While the NDA has only 28 percent of the vote
 tippaniyan However, there may be a slight reshuffle in these figures, as there will be little change from the new results of the by-elections in Andhra Pradesh
 lekin jo bada badlaav aayega, vah he pranab kaa rutaba
 In truth, Rashtrapati Bhavan is the most suitable place for Pranab in the present situation
 vakt ke saath unka sabar bhi kahin na kahin jawaab de rahaa tha
 During this time, he had met Congress President Sonia Gandhi several times and made it clear that now he will not contest the next election
 saath hi 77 saal kii umr main ab vah team rahul kaa bhi hissaa nahin ban sakate
 In such a situation, there are very few options left in this coalition politics
 or sabase ahm baat yah ki maujuuda halaat main pranab mukherjee jaisi swikayrta kisi or kii nahin he
 Pranab Mukherjee leads the race for Raisina, who has support from other parties besides the UPA alliance
 gathbandhan main agar kisi kaa virodh he, to vah naam mamata banerjee kaa he, jise lekar pranab ne abhi tak ummid nahin chodi he
 On the other hand, PA Sangma is in the fray against Pranab who has the support of BJP, BJD and Jayalalithaa's AIADMK
 lekin mamata ko lekar dotarafa khinchataan jari he
 Actually, when we talk about the presidential elections this time, the beginning has been a blast, which hardly anyone expected
 mulaayam or mamata ne jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke sujhaaye naam khaarij kar apane teen vikalp die, to desh main ek tarah se siyaasi tsunami aa gai
 Media cameras cling to the shaken relationship of the coalition government
 mamata ne to baqayada kalam ko jeet kii badhai tak de di
 It is another matter that Kalam did not approve of the race
 hakeekat to yah he ki raashtrapati ke naam par sari atakalbajiyaan tabhi tak raheen, jabatak pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan nahin hua
 Shortly thereafter, the picture began to be cleared
 mulaayam ne fouran pranab ke naam par muhar laga di
 Pranab Mukherjee's specialty has been to decide according to the situation
 khaskar kab, kahaan or kya bolnaa he, isamen bhi unka jawaab nahin
 Pranab da is rarely heard by people speaking Hindi, but if the election campaign is to be held in Allahabad, it does not make sense to speak Bengali or English
 isliye dada ne hindi main bhaashan diya
 This is the same grandfather who once said that he cannot become the Prime Minister, because he does not know Hindi
 vaise hindi aana, na aana alag baat he, par unhen bolnaa aata he, jo sabase pate kii baat he
 Despite the long and close relationship, seeing the strong opposition of Mamta Banerjee, where even the housemates were shocked, Pranab Mukherjee's very serious and nappy-tula statement came that she is like my younger sister
 maujuuda aankadon ke tahat pranab kii raah bahut mushkil nahin dikhti
 In fact, UPA has 42 per cent of the votes, including 4 from Trinamool
 4 fisadi vot shaamil hai
 If the Samajwadi Party 6 by removing it
 2 fisadi jod den, to aankada 43
 8 percent
 isamen left ke 4
 48 on adding 7 per cent
 5 fisadi vot ho jate hai
 And now 3 of the BSP
 8 fisadi kaa samarthan milane se samarthan 52
 Pranab's victory is confirmed at 3 percent
 jabaki endie ke paas sirf 28 fisadi vot he
 The comments haalanki in aankadon main thodi bahut pherbadal ho sakati he, kyonki andhra pradesh main hue upachunaavon ke nae nateezon se isamen thodaa badlaav aayega
 But the big change that will come is Pranab's status
 vaise sach kaha jaae to maujuuda halaat main pranab ke liye raashtrapati bhawan sabase makul jagah he
 With time, his patience was also responding somewhere
 is dauraan vah kai baar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar saaf kar chuke the ki ab vah aglaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Also, at the age of 77, he can no longer be a part of Team Rahul
 aise main gathbandhan kii is raajnneeti main kaaphi kam vikalp bachate hai
 And most importantly, in the current situation no one else like Pranab Mukherjee is acceptable
 darasal is baar ke raashtrapati chunaavon kii baat karen to shuruyaat hi dhamaakedaar rahi, jisaki shaayad hi kisi ko ummid rahi ho
 When Mulayam and Mamta rejected their suggested names of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and gave them three options, there was a kind of political tsunami in the country
 gathbandhan sarkaar ke hilte-dulte rishton se media ke camere chipak gaye
 Mamta even congratulated Kalam for winning
 yah alag baat he ki kalam ne res main utarana manjuur hi nahin kiya
 The reality is that all the speculation in the name of the President remained until Pranab Mukherjee's name was announced
 uske fouran baad hi tasviir saaf hone lagi
 Mulayam immediately stamped the name of Pranab
 halaat ke mutabik faisla lenaa pranab mukherjee kii khaasiyat rahi he
 Especially when, where and what to say, they do not even have an answer
 pranab da ko hindi bolte logon ne shaayad hi kabhi suna ho, par chunaav prachaar elahabaad main karnaa ho to bengali yaa angreji bolne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 Therefore Dada gave a speech in Hindi
 yah vahi dada hai, jinhone ek baar kaha tha ki vah pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate, kyonki unhen hindi nahin aati

 com The Mahaghotale of Punjab National Bank has taken a completely political color
 congress or bijepi donon hi is neerav modi frod kaa jimmaa ek duusare par phodne par tike hue hai
 But in spite of this, the things that are not being noticed, are some common mistakes that happened during this fraud
 agar in baton kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa to shaayad is ghotaale kii naubat hi nahin aati
 There are 7 major mistakes in this scam
 1
 When the Letter of Undertaking is issued, it is always sent to the bank that is the key to that process
 is cese main 2010 se lagaataar kai baar lou jari kiye gaye the, lekin sawaal yah he ki har baar inako videshi branch se bhi manjuuri koun de rahaa tha
 2
 lou jari hone ke baad do bainkon ke bich main sandhi kii prakriya hoti he jo lone dene kii prakriya kii jaanch karti he
 The question is whether any such procedure was followed in this case
 kyonki agar kiya jaataa to neerav modi ke sabhi bank acounts or pichley record kii jaanch hoti
 3
 agar lone chukaane main tay samay se 2 saal se adhik kaa samay biit jaataa he, to bank kii taraf se audit kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, did any bank auditor not pay attention to this type of concern
 neerav-chokasee the or badi lut kii firaaq main, PNB ghotaale ke pardaafash se phiraa pani!4
 Whenever lou is released, it goes through a long process
 yani junior level se lekar bade level tak prakriya kii jaanch hoti he
 But in this case, the name of the officials of small level is coming again and again, in such a situation, could not this procedure also be followed? 5
 After the LOU, internal checks at the branch and head office level of the bank accounts continue continuously
 isi prakaar kii jaanch arabiai level par bhi hoti he
 If there was persistent disturbance in this case, was it not found in any level of investigation
 6
 The Chief Vigilance Officer who investigates does not report directly to the Bank's MD but directly to the Chief Vigilance Commissioner
 agar koi gadabadi hoti he to wo sidhaa chif visilence kamishnar kii nazar main aati he
 But if this scam had been going on for 7 years, did any officer not feel any disturbance
 PNB mahaghotaalaa: 3 aropiyon ko remand, neerav faraar, kaise vasuul honge 11400 karod?7
 An RBI officer is definitely included in the board of directors of every bank
 aisa isliye kiya jaataa he ki bank kii gatividhiyon par nazar rakhi ja sake
 But it seems that this has not happened in this case, neither PNB nor RBI had any knowledge of the scam
 rachi thi badi sajeesh!punjab neshnal bank (PNB) ghotaalaa maamle main aaropee arbapati hira kaarobaari neerav modi or mehul chokasee ne share bazaar ke jariye janata ko bhi luutane kii badi sajeesh rachi thi
 Together, the two were looking to execute a scam several times larger than Rs 11,400 crore
 agar samay rahete is 11,400 karod rupee ke ghotaale kaa pardaafash nahin hua hota, to neerav modi or mehul chokasee isse bhi kai guna zyada rakam kii lut ko anjaam dete
 Both were preparing to enter the stock market and were going to resort to the stock market to raise funds from the public
 neerav modi kii firestar diamonds or gitanjali james kii ek sahyogi company ke liye IPO yani initial public ofer laane kii taiyaari thi
 Last year, Nirav Modi appointed bankers for the IPO of Firestar Diamonds and Gitanjali Gems' Constellation World got the green signal from capital market regulator SEBI for an IPO in November last year

 On 23 May 2019, when the results were coming, there were three types of messages on my whatsapp
 abhi do tarah ke massej kii baat karuunga or akhir main tisare prakaar ke massej kii
 Many messages were such that today let us see if Ravish Kumar has semolina or not
 uskaa cheharaa murajhaayaa he yaa nahin
 One wrote that he wants to see Ravish Kumar being abused
 dub kar mar jate dekhnaa chahta he
 Wants to see puncture made
 kisi ne poocha ki bernol kii tub he yaa bhijwa den
 Someone sent that send a picture of your face, we want to see
 maine sabhi ko jeet kii shubhakamanaayen deen
 Rather, during live coverage, he mentioned such messages and laughed at himself
 duusare prakaar ke massej main yah likhaa tha ki aaj se aap naukari kii samasya, kisaanon kii pidaa or pani kii takalif dikhaanaa band kar dijie
 This public is worth it
 bolnaa band kar do
 Don't you think you're rejected too? aapako vichaar karnaa chahie ki kyon aapaki patrakarita modi ko nahin haraa saki
 i do not feed
 is par bhi likh chukaa hum ki bakrii paal len magar mugaalata na paalen
 How did the 2019 mandate come against me? Did i say in five years that he was also at stake? Were the millions of people whose suffering we showed wrong? i knew that youth, farmers and people working as slaves in banks are supporters of BJP
 unhone bhi mujhase kabhi jhooth nahin bolaa
 Everyone said before or after that they are supporters of Narendra Modi
 maine is aadhaar par unki samasya ko khaarij nahin kiya ki ve narendra modi ke samarthak hai
 But his problem was real, so it appeared
 aaj ek saansad nahin kah saktaa ki usne pachaas hazaar se adhik logon ko niyukti patr dilvaaya he
 Due to my job series, people have received appointment letters from Delhi to Bihar
 kai parikshaon ke riselt nikle
 Many of them apologized when they got appointment letters
 They used to abuse me
 mere paas sainkadon patr or massej ke screen shot pade hai jinamein logon ne niyukti patr milane ke baad gaali dene ke liye maafee maangi he
 Not a single one of them can prove that i have ever said not to vote for Narendra Modi
 yah zarur kaha ki vot apane man se den, vot dene ke baad naagarik ban janaa
 The success of more than fifty thousand appointment letters is the success that i would put on my chest like a badge even at the moment of being abetted by Modi supporters
 kyonki ve mujhe nahin un modi samarthakon ko hi zaleel karenge jinhone mujhase apni samasya ke liye sampark kiya tha
 The pressure of the job series was that a government with a strong majority like Narendra Modi had to take out jobs in the Railways
 ise mudda banavaa diya
 Otherwise you should see how much vacancy has come in the railway in the entire five years and in the last year
 kya isaki maang godi media kar rahaa tha yaa raveesh kumaar kar rahaa tha? prime time main maine dikhaaya
 Was Modi's opposition to getting a train like the Freedom Fighter Express run on time for some time under the Rail Series? Was it anti-modi to talk of youth trapped in three-year BA in colleges in Bihar for five years? In this five years, crores of people read me
 hazaron kii sankhya main aakar suna
 Seen on tv baahar mila to gale lagaaya
 Gave love usamen narendra modi ke samarthak bhi the
 There were people of the Sangh as well as of the opposition
 bijepi ke log bhi the magar ve chupchaap badhai dete the
 i understood one thing
 modi kaa samarthak ho yaa virdohi vah godi media or patrakarita main fark karata he
 As dock media anchors attack me in the guise of Modi's popularity, Modi's supporters go silent
 bharat jaise desh main eemaandaar or naitik hone kaa saamaajik or sansthagat dhaancha nahin he
 The battle to be honest here is fought alone and lost
 log tanj karte hai ki kahaan gaye satyawadee raveesh kumaar
 Where did Ravish Kumar talk about journalism
 mujhamen kamiyaan hai
 I'm not ideal kabhi daawa nahin kiya lekin jab aap yah kehete hai aap usee patrakarita ke mol ko doharaa rahe hote hai jisaki baat main kahata hum yaa mere jaise kai patrkaar kehete hai
 i knew that i was fighting a losing battle in my profession
 itani badi satta or corporate kii puunji se ladane kii takat sirf gandhi main thi
 But when many journalists like me are trying to do journalism independently on low income, then i felt that i should do more
 maine hindi ke pathakon ke liye rose subah angrezi se anuwaad kar modi virodh ke liye nahin likhaa tha balki is khushrahmi main likhaa ki hindi kaa pathak sakasham ho
 It took hours
 mujhe thik-thik pataa tha ki main yah lambey samay tak akele nahin kar saktaa
 There was no cynicism against Modi
 apane pesh se kuch zyada prem tha isliye daanv par laga diya
 There was a risk of questioning his presentation
 apane liye rojgaar ke avasar ganvaa dena
 Still tried it for some time in life
 iskaa apana tanaav hota he, jokhim hota he magar jo sikhta he vah durlabh he
 By asking the question of wallet, i can hide among Modi supporters but you cannot come in front of the readers
 maine zarur sampradayikta ke kilaaf sabake bich aakar bolaa
 i will still speak today aapke bheetar dharmik or jaateey purvaagrah baith gaya he
 You are becoming a machine
 main phir se kahata hum ki dharmik or jaateey purvaagrah se las sampradayikta aapako ek din maanav bam main badal degi
 Looking at the anchors dancing in the studio, you would also think that this is not journalism
 bainkon main ghulaam kii tarah kaam karne vaali sainkadon mahila afasaron ne apane garbh gir jane se lekar shauchalay kaa bhay dikhaa kar kaam karaane kaa patr kya mujhase modi kaa virodh karaane ke liye likhaa tha? unke patr aaj bhi mere paas pade hai
 i gave voice to their problem and there were separate toilet for women in many bank branches
 maine modi kaa agenda nahin chalaaya
 That was not my job
 agar aap mujhase yahi ummid karte hai tab bhi yahi kahuunga ki ek baar nahin sau baar soch lijie
 Sure journalism also has 'memories of the sins of the past' which Modi keeps alive from time to time, but he is forgetting that the journalistic model of his time is based on the crimes of the past
 mai nahin maanata ki patrakarita haari he
 Journalism will end, that is another matter
 jab patrakarita hi nahin bachi he to phir aap patrakarita ke liye meri hi taraf kyon dekh rahe hai
 Have you pledged a complete end
 jab main apni baat karata hum to usamen ve saare patrakaron kii bhi baaten hai jo sangharsh kar rahe hai
 Journalism has ceased due to unscrupulous forces accumulated in journalistic institutions
 uskaa bachaav ek vyakti nahi kar saktaa he
 In such a situation what people like us will do
 phir bhi aise kaam ko sirf modi virodh ke chashme se dekha janaa thik nahin hoga
 It is more opposed to the decline within his profession
 yah baat modi samarthakon ko is daur main samajni hogi
 Modi's support is different
 acchhee patrakarita kaa samarthan alag he
 Modi will also appeal to the supporters that you should stop watching the dock media channel
 akhbaar padhanaa band kar den
 Without this, it is possible to support Modi
 baharhaal, 23 may 2019 ko ai aandhi guzar chuki he lekin hawa abhi bhi tej chal rahi he
 Narendra Modi has established an unbroken rule on the hearts and minds of the people of India
 2014 main unhen man se vot mila tha, 2019 main tan or man se vot mila he
 In the face of all the problems that have come to the body, people have voted with their hearts
 unki is jeet ko udaartaa ke saath sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 i also do jan ko thukraa kar aap loktantric nahin ho sakate hai
 The dangers of the future can be seen in that happiness, but to see it, you also have to be involved
 yah samajhane ke liye bhi shaamil hona chahie ki akhir vah kya baat he jo logon ko modi banaati he
 Making people Modi means being united in their leader
 ek tarah se villin ho janaa
 This can be called blind faith but it should also be seen as the best state of devotion
 modi ke liye logon kaa modi ban janaa us shreshth avasthaa kaa pratik he
 Instead of house to house Modi, you can say Modi
 main hameshaa se kahata rahaa hum ki 2014 ke baad se is desh ke ateet or bhavishya ko samajhane kii sandarbh bindu( reference point) badal gai he
 Even before the election, Prime Minister Modi had started talking about new India
 vah nayaa bharat unki soch kaa bharat ban gaya he
 Every mandate has possibilities and apprehensions
 isse mukt koi janadesh nahin hota he
 If the public has chosen a possibility in the midst of all the apprehensions, it means that it also has enough courage to deal with those apprehensions
 vah bhaybheet nahin he
 Neither is it a mandate of fear nor should it be intimidated by this mandate
 aitihaasik kaarnon se janata ke bich kai sandarbh bindu punap rahe the
 For decades he saw this as his dissent
 bahut baad main vah apane is adal-badal ke asantosh se ukta gai
 He held the view where the immoralities of the past were questioned
 janata ‘ateet ke asantoshon kii smritiyon' se ubar nahin pai he
 This time, that memory of dissatisfaction has been revealed in the name of ideology which is being called New India
 maine hameshaa kaha he ki narendra modi kaa vikalp vahi banegaa jisamen naitik shakti hogi
 You will see the matter of moral force in my articles
 beshak narendra modi ke paksh main aniatik shaktiyon or sansadhano kaa vipul bhandar he
 But the public sees it as a virtue of 'memories of discontent of the past'
 bardaasht kar leti he
 Narendra Modi also keeps alive that 'memories of discontent of the past'
 aap dekhenge ki vah har pal ise rekhaankit karte rahete hai
 Put the public in the 'present of the past'
 janata ko pataa he ki vipaksh main bhi vahi aniatik shaktiyaan hai jo modi paksh main he
 The opposition felt that the public would choose it from two equally immoral forces
 isliye usne bachi-khuchi aniatik shaktiyon kaa hi sahaara liya
 Narendra Modi also weakened and hollowed out those immoral powers
 vipaksh ke netaa bijepi kii taraf bhaagane lage
 Opposition began to be empty of human and economic resources
 donon kaa aadhaar aniatik shaktiyaan hi thim
 But this situation provided a new opportunity for the opposition
 use chunaav kii chintaa chhod apane raajnneetik or vaicharik punerjeevan ko praapt karata
 He did not
 vipaksh ko ateet ke asantosh ke kaarnon ke liye maafee maangani chahie thi
 New confidence had to be given that this would not happen from now on
 is baat ko le jane ke liye tej dhoop main paidal chalanaa tha
 He did not even do this
 2014 ke baad chaar saal tak ghar baithe rahe
 Did not go among the public like the people
 uski samasyaon par tadarth rup se bole or ghar aakar baith gaye
 When 2019 comes, he aspires to collide with a huge immoral powerhouse by the equation of the remaining immoral forces
 vipaksh ko samajhnaa tha ki alag-alag dalon kii raajnneetik praasangikta samaapt ho chuki he
 The social balance that came to democracy through Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party or Rashtriya Janata Dal has no role today
 beshak in dalon ne samaaj ke pichde or vanchit tabakon ko satta-chakra ghumaakar sheersh par laane kaa aitihaasik kaam kiya lekin isi kram main ve duusare pichde or vanchiton ko bhul gaye
 Their representation in these parties became redundant in the same way as in other parties
 ab in dalon kii praasangikta nahin bachi he to dalon ko bhang karne kaa saahas bhi hona chahie
 He had to dissolve his old ambitions
 bharat kii janata ab nae vichaar or nae dal kaa swaagat karegi tab tak vah narendra modi ke vichaar par chalegi
 Society and politics have been Hinduized
 yah sthaayee rup se hua he main nahin maanata
 Just as the rise of Bahujan powers was not permanent, similarly it is not
 yah itihaas kaa ek chakra he jo ghumaa he
 Just as Mayawati became the Chief Minister with the support of the upper castes, today the Sangh is creating a Hindu nation with the support of the Bahujan
 jo savarna the wo apni jati kii puunji lekar kabhi sapa basapa or rajd ke manchon par apana sahaara dhund rahe the
 When his question grew there, the rest of the Bahujan went on the platform made by the servants
 bahujan raajnneeti ne kab jati ke kilaaf raajnneetik abhiyaan chalaaya
 If there was a politics of combining castes, the Sangh also created a politics of combining castes
 beshak kshetriy dalon ne baad main vikaas kii bhi raajnneeti kii or kuch kaam bhi kiya lekin rashtriya str ke liye apni bhoomika ko haive banane tak simit kar gaye
 One thing Chandrabhan Prasad misses
 vah kehete the ki mayawati kyon nahin aarthik muddon par bolti hai, kyon nahin videsh niti par bolti hai
 The same situation is with all regional parties
 vah pradesh kii raajnneeti to kar lete hai magar desh kii raajnneeti nahin kar pate hai
 The parties emerging as Bahujans have thrown away the book of their ideology
 unke paas ambedkar jaise sabase taarkik vyakti hai lekin abendkar ab pratik or ahankaar kaa kaaran ban gaye hai
 Small groups have become the reason for running
 hamaare mitra rakesh paswan thik kehete hai ki dalit raajnneeti ke naam par ab sanghathanon ke rashtriya adhyaksh hi milte hai, raajnneeti nahin milti he
 Bahujan politics has become a store like Gandhism is a shop
 isamen vichaardhaara se las vyakti aaj tak rashtriya str par ek rajnatik vikalp nahin bana paaya
 He does not form teams
 apane hiton ke liye sanghathan banaata he
 Taking his caste shop, he travels from one party to another
 uske bheetar bhi ahankaar aa gaya
 He kept quiet on the deficiencies of the BSP or Bahujan parties
 vah ahankaar hi tha ki mere jaison ke likhe ko bhi jati ke aadhaar par khaarij kiya jane laga
 i was not moved by my commitment, but started using Ambedkar's name as a weapon, running the shop of commitment
 ve logon ko aadesh dene lage ki kise kya likhnaa chahie
 Just as BJP supporters distribute certificates of nationalism, in the same way some people have started distributing certificates among Ambedkarites
 hamen samaj lenaa chahie ki bahujan paksh main koi kanshiram nahin he
 Kanshi Ram's commitment is not countered
 vah vaicharik patibaddhta thi
 Now we have Prakash Ambedkar who does politics of small motive in the name of Ambedkar
 yahi haal lohia kaa bhi hua he
 Those who are committed to Ambedkar are like the Gandhians who are committed to Gandhi
 donon haashiye par jeene ke liye abhishpt hai
 The alternative is not alliances
 vikalp vilay he
 Is revitalized
 agle chunaav ke liye nahin he
 India has an alternative future
 aapane dekha hoga ki in paanch saalon main maine in dalon par bahut kam nahin likhaa
 Did not write at all about the left
 main maanata hum ki vam dalon kii vichaardhaara aaj bhi praasangik hai magar unke dal or un dalon main apana samay vyateet kar rahaa raajnneetik maanavsansaadhan praasangik nahin hai
 Her role is over
 vah sad rahaa he
 He has only offices left
 kaam karne ke liye kuch nahin bachaa he
 People of the left parties used to complain that there is no left in your program
 kyonki dal ke rup main uski bhoomika samaapt ho chuki thi
 Of course, people like Biju Krishnan did the work of creating a peasant movement in Maharashtra
 yah us vichaardhaara kii upyogita thi
 Not the team
 dal ko bhang karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 The time has come to think new
 main dalon kii vividhta kaa samarthak hum lekin upyogita ke bagair vah vividhta kisi kaam kii nahin hogi
 All these things also apply to the Congress
 bhaajapa ke kaaryakartaaon main aapako bhaajapa dikhti he
 Among Congress workers, you see everything except Congress
 congress chunaav ladanaa chhod de yaa chunaav ko jivan-maran ke prashn kii tarah na lade
 He became Congress
 congress nehru kaa bachaav nahin kar saki
 She could not defend from Patel to Bose
 azaadi kii ladaai kii vividhta or khubsuurati se judi ‘ateet kii smritiyon' ko zindaa nahin kar pai
 Could not stand Gandhi's ideas
 aaj aap bhaajapa ke ek saamaanya kaaryakarta se dinadayal upaadhyaay ke bare main galat tippanee kar dijie vah apni tarah se sau baaten bataaenge, paanch saal main congress party nehru ko lekar samanaantar vimarsh paidaa nahin kar pai, main isi ek paimaane se congress ko dhahte hue dekh rahaa tha
 Politics stands on the ground of ideology, not the possibility of a leader
 ek hi rasta bachaa he
 Human resources remaining in different political parties of India should leave their own party and come to one party
 jahaan vichaaron kaa punarjanm ho, naitik bal kaa srijan ho or maanav sansaadhan kaa hastantaran
 This thing was told to people in 2014 also
 phir khud par hansi ai ki main koun sa vichaarak hum jo yah sab kah rahaa hum
 Writing today iske baad bhi vipaksh ko lekar sahanubhuti kyon rahi
 However, he rarely showed his political side and wrote on it because after 2014, Narendra Modi became the chief at every level
 sirf sarkaar ke str par hi nahin, saanskrithik se lekar dharmik str par modi ke alaava kuch dikhaa nahin or kuch tha bhi nahin
 When 99 percent of India's media started crushing the basic spirit of democracy, i tried to strike a balance in it
 asahmati or vipaksh kii har awaz kaa sammaan kiya
 Did not make fun of him
 yah main vipakshi dalon ke liye nahin kar rahaa tha balki apni samaj se bharat ke loktantr ko sharminda hone se bachaa rahaa tha
 i should not have taken such a huge load because it was not my load, yet i felt that if there would be no opposition within every citizen and within democracy, then everything would become hollow
 meri is soch main bharat kii bhalaai kii niyat thi
 Narendra Modi has won fiercely
 media kii jeet nahin hui he
 There is a defeat in every win
 is jeet main media kii haar hui he
 He did not follow democratic norms
 aaj godi media ke log modi ko mili jeet ke sahare khud kii jeet bataa rahe hai
 Actually he has only Modi left
 patrakarita nahin bachi he
 The religion of journalism has ended
 mumkin he bharat kii janata ne patrakarita ko bhi khaarij kar diya ho
 He has also given a mandate that we want Modi, not journalism
 iske baad bhi meraa yakeen unheen modi samarthakon par he
 They see the difference between Modi and the role of the media
 samajhate hai
 Perhaps they also do not want an India where the representative journalists of the people leave their professional religion and appear at the feet of the leader
 mujhe acha laga ki kai modi samarthakon ne likhaa ki ham aapse asahmat hai magar aapaki patrakarita ke kaayal hai
 You will keep doing your work in the same way
 aise sabhi samarthakon kaa mujh main yakeen karne ke liye aabhaar
 When many of my colleagues went to different areas during election coverage, they said that Modi fans also read and write to you
 sangh ke log bhi ek baar check karte hai ki maine kya bolaa
 i know that if Ravish is no more, he will miss Ravish
 do saal pehle dilli main rahane vaale assi saal ke ek buzurg ne mujhe choti si gita bheji
 Wrote a long letter and wished me a long life
 aagrah kiya ki yah choti si gita apane saath rakhun
 i obeyed him
 apane bag main rakh liya
 When people said, you are no longer safe
 jaan kaa khyaal rakhen to aaj us gita ko palat rahaa tha
 i am sharing one of his sources with you
 mujhe pyaar karte rahiye
 What can i get by pleading? aapkaa hi swabhimaan tuutegaa ki is mahaan bharat main aap ek patrkaar kaa saath nahin de sake
 My friends have given you an opportunity to be free from this guilt
 yah aparaadh bodh aap par usee tarah baari padegaa jaise aaj vipaksh ke liye uski ateet kii aniatiktaayen baari pad rahi hai
 So you strengthen me
 mere jaison ke saath khadey hoiye
 You strengthened Modi
 aapkaa hi dharm he ki aap patrakarita ko bhi majboot karen
 We do not have another option of life
 hota to shaayad aaj is peshey ko chhod detaa
 The reason for that is not lost
 kaaran yah he ki thak gaya hum
 i want to do something new
 lekin jab tak hum tab tak to isi tarah karuunga
 Because the public has not defeated me
 modi ko jitaaya he
 Congratulations to Prime Minister Modi

 Talks between the MCD and the Delhi government have been steadily increasing
 darasal sadan kii baithak ke dauraan bijepi or congress ke parshad kejariwal sarkaar par jamkar barase

 During the meeting of the House in the Northern Municipal Corporation, the councilors of BJP and Congress expressed concern over it and lashed out at the Kejriwal government
 parshadon kaa aarope he ki jab bhi dilli sarkaar ke adhikari se is mudde par baat karte hai to wo adhikari, chune hue pratinidhi se baat tak nahin karte hai, jo ki puri tarah se galat he
 When our employees are present on the visit of the mlas, then why don't the Delhi government employees listen to us? There was a lot of uproar in the House on this issue, after which the Mayor of Northern Municipal Corporation Sanjeev Nayyar issued an order to Commissioner PK Gupta
 It is, from now on, will not directly take orders from any legislator, minister and chief minister of Delhi government
 saath hi kisi bhi vidhayak or mantri ko daure par janaa he ki nahin vah isaki manjuuri milane ke baad hi jayega
 With this, any Minister of Delhi Government will have to take permission from the Commissioner in writing before calling an MCD employee
 vahiin agar emsidi karmchaaree ko nagar nigam parshad or vidhayak main se kisi ko chunanaa he to wo parshad ko pehle sunegein
 And administrative action has been ordered against anyone who does not follow this order
 is maukey par aam aadmi party ke parshadon ne iskaa virodh ye kehete hue kiya ki dilli sarkaar ne vidhansabha main is tarah kaa prastaav nahin paas kiya he to phir uttari nagar nigam is tarah ke prastaav ko kyon paas kar rahi he

 The judge said that he was not in favor of granting Nirav Modi's bail application as the case was 'of a hefty amount' and in view of this, there is a big possibility that the accused once released on bail, then the court i would not like to surrender

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne dalgat raajnneeti se upar uthakar sabhi dalon se lokapal vidheyak paarit karaane main madad kii apil karte hue kaha ki koi aisi cheez na banane den ki vah sab kuch tabah ho jaae, jisapar ham garv karte hai or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladai ke naam par araajaktaa faile
 The Prime Minister said in Lok Sabha on Tuesday that the Lokpal Bill introduced by the Central Government is in keeping with the spirit of Parliament and only Parliament has the right to make laws
 loksabhaa main centre sarkaar dwaara pesh lokapal vidheyak par chal rahi charchaa ke bich manmohan singh ne kaha ki kanoon banane kaa adhikaar sirf sansad ke paas he or baaki log keval apni raay de sakate hai
 He said that the opinion of every section was taken in drafting the Bill
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki keval lokapal vidheyak se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai khatm nahin hogi
 The government has taken unprecedented decisions to root out this evil
 manmohan singh ne raajnneetik dalon se apil karte hue kaha ki lokapal vidheyak gambheer mudda he or ve ise kanoonee daanvpench main na ulajhaayen
 He said that the public is plagued and offended by corruption and his displeasure will be reduced with the formation of Lokpal institution
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ko lokapal ke tahat kaam karne kii anumati nahin di ja sakati kyonki yah samvidhan ke daayre se baahar hoga
 He said that every unit of the country has to work under the constitution itself and it has to keep its accountability to the Parliament
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sabase zyada bhrashtachar rajyon ke str par he or bina lokayukta ke bhrashtachar desh se puri tarah khatm nahin hoga
 Manmohan Singh appealed to all political parties to rise above party politics and help the government in passing the Lokpal Bill
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki centre kii sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ne soochna kaa adhikaar, mahatma gandhi rashtriya rojgaar guarantee kanoon, shiksha kaa adhikaar or khaadya suraksha adhikaar jaise kanoonon se janata ke hit main kaam kiya he
 Manmohan Singh said that the whole country is watching this discussion in the Lok Sabha seriously and this bill should be passed by Parliament
 goa main do saal pehle bijepi duusare number kii party hote hue bhale hi sarkaar banane main safal rahi, lekin sankhya kam hone ke chalate sahyogi dal dabaav banaakar apana hit sadhate rahe
 In such a situation, after 10 Congress mlas joined BJP on Wednesday, the party managed to get more number of mlas than the magic figure of majority
 saath hi jieffpi or nirdaleey vidhayakon ke dabaav se bhi bijepi sarkaar ko mukti mil gai he
 Let me tell you that no one party got majority in the 2017 Goa Assembly elections
 goa ke 40 sadasyon main se congress 17, bijepi 13, jieffpi 3, maharashtravaadi gomantak party (emjeepi) 3, ensipi ek or teen nirdaleey vidhayak jitkar aae
 Although the Congress emerged as the largest party, the BJP was able to form the government by gathering the magic figure of majority before it
 bijepi ne goa main jieffpi, emjeepi or nirdaleey vidhayakon ke saath milakar sarkaar banaaya
 Realizing the political equation of the state, the GFP supported the BJP, including the Deputy CM and Creamy Ministry on its own terms
 iskaa nateeja he ki jieffpi ke sabhi teen vidhayak mantri hai
 GFP President Vijay Sardesai is the deputy CM
 manohar parrikar ke nidhan ke baad congress or bijepi donon hi sarkaar banane main lageen
 But the BJP put the brakes on all speculations by swearing Pramod Sawant
 iske baad saavant ne emjeepi ke do vidhayakon ko todakar bijepi main shaamil kar liya
 The result was that along with Pramod Sawant, MJP rebel Sudin Dhavalikar became deputy CM
 iske alaava nirdaleey vidhayak rohan khounte ko rajasav mantri pad se nawaja gaya
 The GFP and independent legislators were under constant pressure on the Sawant government due to the BJP not having a majority figure
 vakt ne aisi karavat lee ki congress ke 10 vidhayak buudhvaar ko bijepi main shaamil ho gaye or saath hi bijepi ne bahumat ke jaadui aankade se zyada vidhayakon kii sankhya hasil kar lee
 Now BJP has 27 mlas
 jabaki bahumat ke 21 vidhayak chahie
 Currently, Congress has 5, GFP has three NCP and MGP one each and three Independents
 teenon nirdaleey vidhayak bijepi ko samarthan kar rahe hai
 After the political upsurge in Goa, the BJP government has been free from the pressure of the GFP
 ab aise main mana ja rahaa he ki mukhyamantri pramod saavant jald hi apane mantrimandal main pherbadal kar sakate hai
 In this way, GFP President Vijay Sardesai may be discharged from the post of Deputy CM
 iske alaava nirdaleey vidhayak or rajasav mantri rohan khounte ko mantri pad se hataaya ja saktaa he, kyonki congress se bijepi main aae vidhayak party kii kul sankhya kaa do tihaai hai
 Abortion Counselor by profession a 25-year-old American woman got herself abortions, that is, an abortion and made a video of it and uploaded it to youtube
 mahila kaa kahana he ki uskaa makasad us kalank ko khatm karnaa he, jo garbhpaat kii prakriya par lagaaya jaataa he
 This woman named Emily Let's work at Cherry Hill Women's Center in New Jersey
 unka kahana he ki sex agucator hone ke baavjood unhone garbh nirodhak dawaaon kaa seven nahin kiya or pichley saal november main vah galati se pregnent ho gayi
 His three-minute video uploaded to youtube shows him sitting on a wheel chair to go to the operation theater
 iske baad doctor unke garbhashay yani ki bacchaadaani se bhrun nikaal dete hai
 She is awake during the entire operation, but she was given mild anesthesia so she does not feel pain
 is video ko ab tak kai log dekh chuke hai or kade shabdon main isaki ninda kar rahe hai
 She was a three-month pregnant at the time Emily underwent an abortion
 unka kahana he ki agar vah chaahati to oparation ke bajaae dawa khaakar bhi baccha gira sakati thim
 But 'she wanted to have an abortion because of the operation because it is the one thing that women are most afraid of'
 wo kahati hai, 'main dikhaanaa chaahati thi ki yah itnaa daraavna nahin he or aborshan ke peeche koi sakaaratmak kahani bhi ho sakati he
 this is my story'
 haalanki unhone yah nahin bataaya ki aborshan ke vakt vah relationships main thim yaa nahin
 He said, 'I knew i was not ready to take care of the child'
 aborshan ke dauraan emily hospital goun pahanakar relax hone ke liye gahari saans le rahi hai or gunaguna rahi hai
 She is also seen interacting with a staff member, who is rubbing her hand in support
 aborshan kii prakriya puri hone par wo chillaate hue kahati hai, 'ye, kool, mujhe acha lag rahaa he
 My work is done'
 aborshan ke ek maheene baad emily ne darshakon se apana anubhav saajha kiya
 He said that most of the women in his clinic have an abortion after abortion, but this is not the case with them
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe aisa nahin lagata ki main buree insaan hum
 i did not mind
 mujhe pataa tha ki main jo karne ja rahi hum vah sahi he
 He was right for me, not for anyone else '
 emily ne 14 march ko yah video aplod kiya tha or tab se lekar ab tak ise kai log dekh chuke hai
 However, the comment box has been removed from the bottom of the video
 emily ne bataaya ki jab unhone apana video fasebuk par aplod kiya to duusari mahilaon ne bhi apni kahaniyaan unke saath saajha kii
 He said, 'A lady sent me a message saying that she has been suffering since abortion

 When 60-year-old Islamic scholar and MBA degree holder Maulana Ghulam Muhammad Vastanvi became Mohtamim of the religious education institute of Deoband, Darul Uloom, it was considered by many to be a sign of hopeful days to come
 unki in ghoshnaaon se ki ''sabhi samudaay'' narendra modi ke gujarat main samrudh ho rahe hai or ''vikaas ke maamle main, rajya main alpsankhyakon ke prati koi bhedbhaav nahin he'' in ummiido ko bal mila tha

 a post shared by Gauri Khan (@gaurikhan) on May 27, 2017 at 11:07 am PDT piem modi ke raajnneetik jivan par bani film 'piem narendra modi' charchaaon main he
 The shooting of the film was completed in about 39 days
 ise loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 5 april ko relies bhi kiya janaa tha
 But two days before the release, the makers changed the film's release date for the second time
 relies date kyon badali gai, ek report main iske khulaase kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Spotboy has reported in a report that the film could not get written certification from the censor board
 is vajah se film kii relies date ek hafte aage khiskaani padi
 According to the report, the makers had submitted the film with the suggested 4 cuts from the censors
 lekin ab tak film ko sensor se certificate nahin mila he
 In this regard, the makers also made several phone calls and messages to CBFC Regional Officer Tushar Karmakar, but there was no response from his side
 spotboy se baatcheet main film se jude kareebi sutara ne kaha, "is samay main kuch nahin jaanata
 What can i tell you " vahiin duusare sutara kaa kahana tha, "unhen bhi nahin pataa ki film tay date par cinemagharon main relies hogi yaa nahin
 "according to the report, the manufacturers had received a verbal response from the censors
 lekin buudhvaar tak certification ko lekar koi likhit jawaab nahin aane kii vajah se nirmaataaon ko relies date aage khiskaani padi
 Let us tell you that this is the second time when the release date of PM Narendra Modi was changed
 pehle ise loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle phej kii voting ke baad 12 april ko relies kiya janaa tha
 However, the release date was later fixed April 5 before voting
 ab sensor kii aadchan kii vajah se phir se puraani date (12 april) par film relies karne kii taiyaari he
 a special petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court to ban the movie
 jis par 8 april ko sunwaayee hogi
 The hearing in SC is considered as the second reason for postpone release date
 isse pehle piem narendra modi main pradhanmantri modi kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe vivek oberoi ne aaj tak / india today se baatcheet main kaha tha, "jab chunaav ayog ko court ko, movie se aapatti nahin he phir meri film kaa kyon virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 "let us state that some opposition parties including Congress, DMK and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena are objecting to the release of the film before the elections

 At the beginning, students will fill the common form for choice filling and will be able to select the iits and NIT institutes together

 There are 28 party grounds from Agra city

 Agra district has a total of nine seats, of which the BSP got 6 seats in the last
 lekin is baar siton ke parisemen or kisi ke paksh main koi khaas hawa na hone ke chalate sabhi raajnneetik dal uhapoh kii sthiti main hai
 Last time there was 43 per cent of the votes, but this time due to the Anna factor and given the first five rounds of voting, it is estimated to be at least 60 per cent

 According to analysts, the BSP will be at a loss, but no one is able to estimate it openly

 This time Sharma is in the fray on SP ticket

 bhaajapa ne lodh vot bank main sendhamari kii garaj se hi ram singh ko pehle pratyaashee ghoshit kiya tha lekin unhone apane putr kaa naam aage kar diya
 If we talk about development in Dibai assembly constituency, then it seems that after seeing the plight of the people, the public representatives here have not given any consideration to development
 sthaneey logon kii maane to urja mantri ke bhai ke chunaav maidan main utarane ke kaaran bijli aapurti thodi sudhari he, lekin vah bhi chunaav se ain pehle
 Talking about the caste figures of Dibai assembly constituency, the highest number of Lodh Rajput voters here is around 92,000, which proves decisive
 iske alaava muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya 38,000, kshatriya 16,000 or jat matadaataaon kii lagbhag 18,000 sankhya bhi ummidavaaron kii kismat kaa faisla karne main mahatvapurn sabit hogi

 God's clothing is made by the fashion designer! This is a new trend
 manyata rahi he ki manushya or sabhi jeevon kii door ishwar ke haath main hoti he
 Instead of wearing anything according to the will of the idols of such a god, now, organically designed clothes are being worn
 or is kaam ko anjaam de rahe hai kota ke yuva fishan diziner sumit goyal, jinaki shahar main bhi apni workshop he
 In recent years, he has designed the corsets of the idols of many temples in India and abroad
 jaipur ke isckon mandir or neujersey (america) ke swami narayan mandir kii murtiyon ko unke taiyaar kiye vastra pahanane kaa sukh praapt ho chukaa he
 He has so far designed more than 1,000 sculpture garments including the temples of Kota and many other metropolises in the country

 People have become more alert than ever about their clothes
 logon kaa pahanava badal rahaa ho to unke aradhy kii veshbhusha kaise na badale
 Goel, who had taken a course from the prestigious Indian Institute of Fashion Technology (IIFT) in Delhi in 1995 and was a member of Ritu Berry Fashion Fraternity, got the idea right at home
 daadi ko shaukia taur par murtiyon ke vastra silate dekh unhen laga ki kyon na ise bhi dizin kiya jaae
 The matter went ahead
 sabase pehle kota ke hi radhakrishna mandir tak unki pahunch bani
 His grandfather became the founder chairman of the temple committee
 unhone radhakrishna kii murti ke liye vastra rache
 It was expected that no one would mind the color, stitching, configuration of the fabric
 par jab apane banaae kapade bhagwaan ko pahane dekhakar logon ke chehre par khushi dekhi tab jaakar unhone raahat kii saans lee
 After that, there was a flurry of proposals
 kai mandiron kii prabandh samitiyon se jude log unase apane yahaan kii murtiyon ke vastra taiyaar karne kaa aagrah karne lage
 He did this for Teleshwar Mahadev, Godavari Dham and Banke Bihari Temple
 inamen chand inch lambaai vaali se lekar adamkad murtiyon tak shaamil thim
 Discussions of this work started out of tradition also reached other places
 jaipur or jodhpur ke baad rajdhani dilli, phir bangaloru, mumbai or nagpur ke mandiron kii murtiyon ko bhi unhone sanvaara
 Later people started designing clothes for the gods and goddesses of their homes
 mandiron main devataaon kii murtiyon ke vastra din bhar yaa maheene main kai baar badalte jate hai
 In Goyal's own words, "I gave different options to change clothes every time
" '' unhone devataaon ke swabhaav or murtiyon ke saundaryabodh ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah kaam kiya
 The first was the practice of idols wearing dark-colored robes of silk and satin
 goyal ne usamen fishan or mausam ke anuroop bhi badlaav kiye
 For example, they used ribbons, sequins, net clothes and many other things
 majaa dekhie ki garmi ke liye halke rang ke or jaadon ke liye mote kapade bane
 Anurag Nandwana, director of Kota-based National Institute of Fashion Designing, also says, "sumit's design is a novelty
 unhone is peshey main ek nayaa pahalu joda he
 If this new venture of his is called Textile Spirituality? Is not bad maine apane ghar main ek alikhit kanoon bana rakhaa he ki kuch bhi ho jaae main sabji to bana luungi lekin pyaaj nahin kaatoongi
 The thought of cutting onions makes me cry

 This compound's pungent steam causes a burning sensation in our eyes
 hamaari ankhon kii eicchhi khubiyah he ki isamen agar koi bahari tatv aa jaataa he to yah aansu nikaalkar use dhone kaa prayaas karti he
 Easy ways to avoid this: 1
 aap jis jagah pyaaj kaat rahe hon vahaan candal yaa lamp jala len
 By doing this, the gas released from the onion will go towards the candle or lamp and will not reach your eyes
 2
 Close the fans running around while cutting the onion

 Under pressure from the media, the police forced Ravindra Patil to change his statement
 rabindra patil ne shuruaati exiaar main salmaan khan ke nashe main hone kaa zikr nahin kiya tha
 Four-five days later, in his supplementary statement, Patil had said that Salman was drunk at the time of the incident
 koi police vaala jab shikayatakarta hoga to ye kaise maan liya jaae kii accident kii sabase badi vajah (sharaab kaa nashe main gaadi chalaane) kaa zikr apane pehle bayaan main nahin karegaa or salmaan ke sharaab ke nashe main hone kii baat use chaar-paanch din baad samaj main aegi
 Salman's car was running at 30-40 kmph, not at the speed of 90 -100 kmph that night
 'salmaan khan ke vakil ne court main anemeshan ke jariye bataane kii koshish ki salmaan minul gonsalvij road se hill road par gaadi laae the

 The public prosecutor objected to the video being shown in the court of Salman's lawyer, saying that if the defense can show the video, then we will also make a video and explain how the accident happened

 is bare main hamaari baat mumbai port main dipti secretary ke pad se ritair hue avinaash darole se bhi hui
 He told us that 'port' in Mumbai is also called 'monkey'
 video ke saath chhedchhad bhi kii gai he
 The video has been truncated in such a way that it is seen that Modi is talking about animal 'monkey'
 yah video oktober 2017 main modi ke gujarat ke dwarka main hue ek bhaashan kaa he
 At that time Modi went to Dwarka to lay the foundation stone of some development projects
 isi bhaashan ke video ke kuch hisse uthaakar viral video ko banaaya gaya he
 In real video, Modi is also heard saying 'monkey-based development' in English as 'port Led Development', which has been deliberately removed from the viral video
 agar modi ke is bhaashan ko suna jaae to ye baat saaf ho rahi he ki wo bandargah ke sandarbh main 'bandar' shabd kaa upyog kar rahe hai

 His exploits are also black
 unka zehan bhi kaala he
 And now in order to save their lives, they are adopting black as well
 ji haa
 ISIS terrorists are saving their lives in Mosul, Iraq by hiding their faces in the black men of women
 kaale burke ke peeche chhipe bujdil aatankiyon kii puri kahani ham aapako bataa rahe hai
 It is said that when the jackal dies, he runs towards the city
 magar iraq sebagadadike aatanki to sirf bhaag nahin rahe hai balki munh chipa-chhipaakar bhaag rahe hai
 That too behind the burqas
 maut ko saamne dekhakar bagdadi ke aatankiyon kii sari mardaangi kafoor ho gai he
 And to save lives, now they are resorting to life-long clothes
 mosul ko aatank se azaad karaane ke baad jaise hi iraqi sena ne use chaaron taraf se gheraa
 Like here, the terrorists hiding in the bills like mice started to fear the death
 jaan bachaane ke liye wo aise tadap rahe hai, jaise bin pani machhlee tadapati he
 If there is no way out, now these terrorists have taken the support of this women libel for their safety
 bagdadi ke aatanki jis mosul main badi shaan se goli chalaate hue aae the
 From the same Mosul, they are fleeing like Bujdil hiding their mouth behind the burqa
 iesas ke gurgon ko pakade jane kaa khauf itnaa he ki ankhon main surama, gaalon main laali or honton par lipstick bhi laga lee he
 Even got i-bro made
 pakade na jaaen or dur se mahilaon jaise dikhen isliye unhone vaise hi libaas bhi pahan rakhe hai
 Some have even made more arrangements to look exactly like women
 mosul main iesas kii haar ke baad iraqi pradhanmantri ne andeshaa jataayaa tha ki ilaake main abhi bhi kuch aatanki chhipe hue hai
 His fears are proving right
 sena kaa search aaparishan jari he
 In which the terrorists who are adopting different tactics of escape are being caught
 inamen se kuch tareeke to dilachasp hone ke saath saath hairaan kar rahe hai
 Some terrorists of Baghdadi have been caught in full make-up in Mosul, who were trying to throw dust in the eyes of the Iraqi army
 vesh badalane kii is mashkkat main ek aatankwaadi ne kai tarah kii chaalaakiyaan to dikhaai
 But forgot to shave his beard and mustache
 isi dadhi or moonch ne ise pakadava diya
 Otherwise, their eyes are gray
 un ankhon main lage kaajal
 The mole made of white color and face had betrayed the Iraqi army for a moment
 doosraa aatanki halake begni color kaa suut pahane tha
 Dubatta le and neatly made i-bro
 sochaa tha jatke main nikal jayega magar funs gaya
 The third terrorist has done the limit
 ghaghara pahanakar nikal padaa
 Got caught
 hansi kii hasarat karai so alag
 The fourth terrorist was so disrespected at such an age that no one was able to show his face to anyone
 paanchavaa aatanki phul burke main tha
 There is no problem of seeing eye nor hand
 magar jaldbaazi main sandals pahananaa bhul gaya or juute main hi nikal padaa bas isi vajah se pakadaa gayis tarah ke aatanki sabhi ek naav ke savaar hai
 When he came to Mosul, he became a man, but turned out to be zanani
 chatha aatanki sabase zyaada surkhiyon main aayaa
 He was a young terrorist
 bechaare ne gaalon par laali
 Mascara in the eyes
 honton main lipstick samet puraa kaa puraa mek-ap box istemaal kar daalaa tha
 But even then it was not successful
 aise hi kai aatankiyon ne pair se lekar sir tak pakkaa intazaam kar rakhaa tha
 But he could not hide his thick hands
 sena ko shaq hua or jab burka utaravaaya gaya to uske neeche se nikle hatte katte aatanki
 Let me tell you that on July 10, the Iraqi army waved Fatah
 or tab se yahaan chhipe aatankiyon ko khoj nikaalane kaa oparation jari he
 So the Iraqi army has banned the burqa covering the face completely
 kyonki aatanki burke ke andar suicide belt pahanakar nikal rahe hai
 And in the fear of getting caught, they are blowing themselves up, due to which the lives of innocent people are being lost
 bade beabaru hokar tere kuche se ham nikle
 That's why we told you "terrorist under my burqa"
 '' magar burke ke andar chhipakar bhaagane vaale ye aatanki kahaan to duniya jeetne nikle the or kahaan ye chappalon se pit rahe hai
 Iraqi soldiers are beating these terrorists with slippers after being captured in Mosul
 unke video bhi saamne aae hai
 a few days ago the hands with which they were firing bullets on innocents
 aaj unheen haathon main nail-polish laga lee he
 In the hope that somehow life will be saved
 magar jaan bachanaa to dur ye to buree tarah zaleel ho rahe hai
 These operatives of Baghdadi had tried to throw dust in the eyes of Iraqi troops
 sir se lekar pair tak kaala burka pahana tha
 Cleaned the beard-mustache and also applied redness, lipstick and surma to the face
 magar sab kuch jaaya chalaa gaya
 And they were caught vicious
 kuch zaruri savalat kiye gaye or phir fori sazaa ke taur par in logon ko chappalon se peet daalaa gaya
 The terrorists hiding in the burqa have shown respect for the terrorist organization ISIS
 magar in ajeebogareeb tasveeron ne to use kahin kaa nahin choda

 is kitaab kaa beej lekhak kii firozabad yatra ke dauraan padaa jo unhone bahaisiyat shikshak apni kuch chaatraon ke saath kii thi
 The purpose of this educational tour was to see the lives of children working in the Bangle Industry of Firozabad as it was a well-intentioned journey, so it was also necessary to know its achievements
 is dal ne firozabad se vaapasi ke samay yah kaam agra main taj mahal ke chabutare par baithak kiya
 This book and subsequently the story of the Taj is detailed in this book, which shows what were the things that inspired the author to "explore the psyche of girls
" ”taj mahal kii god main baithkar apni chaatraon se apane anubhavon kaa vishleshan sunate hue unhen jo mahasoos hua, vahi is kitaab kaa aarambh bana
 "after listening to the comments being made in the class of Taj, my cognizance finally reached the edge where i felt that in the questions arising from the Firozabad visit, there is an edge or prick for these girls that i can see, myself
 Can not feel ” or jo cheez unke ehsaas ke daayre se itani baahar thi, vah thi—ek ladki kaa uski kalaayiyon main padi chudipoon se sambandh
 In the manufacture of beautiful bangles, which every girl wants to wear since childhood, such innocent children have such terrible use, this fact was taking the girls away from the attachment of bangles
 yahi vah bindu tha, jahaan se lekhak ne us maanas ko samajhane kii shuruyaat kii jisaki daihik upasthiti ko ham stri ke rup main chinte hai
 Seeing the white hair of children between the ages of six and seven in the bangle industry, some girls expressed their intention to boycott the bangle for life, and "the idea of the power to adopt this option in the future lives in the minds of these girls
" The reason was that they were girls
 ” in ladakiyon ke saath chuudi kaa, or un sabhi striyochit upaadaanon kaa yah rishta kaise banataa he, jinke jariye ham ek vyakti ko stri ke rup main bhinn dhang se pahachaanate hai, or is rishte ko banane main bhartiya samaaj, samskruti or shiksha tantra kii kya bhoomika hoti he, yahi jaananaa or bataanaa is kitaab kaa uddeshy he
 The book Punaru is a testament to how much Krishna Kumar has remained unsettled in his concerns and his linguistic expression, and how subtle and fine tools he analyzes his concern
 is kitaab main prachlit stri-vimarsh kaa koi bhi maanya muhaavara prayog nahin ki yaa gaya he, to bhi isko padhgaye ke dauraan hi, ham bahaisiyat purush apane aasapaas faile stri-pradesh ko ek nai drushti se dekhne ke liye lagbhag baadhya ho jate hai
 In our mind, this imagination begins to build a house that if we wanted our society, our culture, education and man's power, this woman could have done something else
 ise padhgaye ke baad yah nishchit rup se hota he ki apni satta or uske abha-valay main surakshit purush-satta, agar vah apane astitv mank piroe gaye nari-bhav kaa amul daman nahin kar chuki he or krurta ko usne apana aabhushan nahin bana liya he, to vah apane sabase nikat maujuud stri ko dekhakar karunadrr ho uthati he
 This book has told him how insignificantly the process of inculcating this person in this form, but how selfish and predatory motives continue to run in our society all the time

 unhone kaha ki notebandi ke faisle se mazdooron, garibon, kisaanon aurgharelu mahilaonko sabase zyada chot pahunchi he
 However, PM Modi directly hit back at Mamta Banerjee for questioning demonetisation

 The PM said that this fight is against the dishonest and everyone should support it, demonetisation was necessary to eradicate corruption

 PM Modi said to wait for the court on Ram temple

 The latest interview by PM Modi made it clear that the government will not bring an ordinance for the temple in Ayodhya before the Supreme Court's decision
 udhar aresas, viechpi ne fouran adhyadesh laakar ram mandir banane ke liye andolan ched rakhaa he
 They are doing religious meetings on this

 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said on 25 November 2018 that "A year ago i said that be patient
 ab main kahata hum ki dhairya se kaam nahin chalegaa
 People need to be united
 kanoon jald se jald laayaa janaa chahie
 However, now the same Mohan Bhagwat's RSS immediately supported Modi's statement by tweeting
 unke bayaan ko mandir nirmaan ke liye positive bataaya
 We feel that the statement by Prime Minister is a positive step in the direction of Temple Construction
