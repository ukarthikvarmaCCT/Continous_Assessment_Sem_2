 If consumers were surprised that their beloved Maggie was unsuitable for human consumption, Nestle was shocked to learn that the company had found that Maggi samples in the test contained monosodium glutamate (MSG) and The level of lead was found to be high & this was also not detected through any governmental authority, but only when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Uttar Pradesh released the laboratory's extract Decided to make the terms public
 nestle ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he, “aap kuch bhi pareekshan kar len, ems usamen nikalegaa

 Because i know that our country is very beautiful and i want to promote tourism in this country
 mujhe kashmir main shoot karnaa kaaphi pasand he
 Many films can be shot without research, but a film like India, with which many historical narrators are also associated, do you read the references associated with them? Or are you completely dependent on the director in such a case? Yes, i know a lot about the film
 jab mujhe jaankaree milti he to main use pard letaa hum
 It has a reference to the World Cup, in addition to when oil came out inside Abu Dhabi and how people went there
 or wo marchent navy kaa ek daur aayaa tha jab sab marchent navy join kar rahe the
 Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Wala will also be available

 Songs in your films are often a mix of Hindi and English songs and they are something that matches your personality and story
 kya aap bhi apni filmon ke gaanon ke criation main shaamil hote hai ?haa, main apni filmon ke mujeec main kaaphi dilchaspee rakhata hu
 i take the final decision on the music of the film
 vishaal shekhar achche muneecian hai
 We have 5-6 songs and all these songs have become very good
 aaj kaa daur alag he
 Singing is the first thing in any film nowadays
 aajkal mujeec diarectors par kaaphi pressure rahata he
 The directors also have a lot of pressure so that they can choose the right song
 har ek kaa test alag-alag he
 Music is playing something different
 main kuch alag hi mujeec kar rahaa hum
 That too is going on
 log kehete hai ki film main salmaan khan he isliye film kaa mujeec acha he
 but it's not like that
 agar logon ko sound pasand aayaa, feel pasand ai to log sunate hai
 Most of the songs, when a two or three year old child starts singing, is a barometer that this song is a hit
 main kisi music pandit kaa wet nahin karata hum jo film ke gaanon ko lekar apni raay den
 i think that child's opinion matters to me
 main duusare actors ke liye filmein nahin bana rahaa hum or naa hi main critics ko impress karne ke liye filmein bana rahaa hum
 i make movies so that my fans go to the theater and have a good time
 thodaa kuch seekhney ko mili, thodaa dance kare, thodaa sa roen or thodaa sa us kairactor kaa 10-15 pratishat ghar par lekar jaae or usko apane jivan main utaarne kii koshish karen
 Katrina recently said that she cannot be in every Salman Khan film
 kya aap apane production house main actraces kaa chunaav karte hai ?nahi
 If the director of the film says that Katrina should be taken, then Katrina's name is considered
 udhaaharan ke taur par, maine film dabang kii
 Sonakshi Sinha also appeared in the second part of this film
 mere hisaab se jab bhi dabang film hogi, tab- tab film main sonakshi dekhne ko milegi
 Jacqueline is in a similar kick
 kik ke part 2 main bhi jacleen hi nazar aaengi
 Katrina will always be there in the Tiger series
 ham actraces ko halke main nahin le sakate hai
 We know all the good things about you
 aapke bare main wo ek chiz kya he jo aapako bura banaati he?kai sari buree chizein hai
 Very bad lekin main unhen share nahin kar saktaa hum
 Those bad things are such that i will carry them to my grave

 shivasena ke netaa or rajyasabha ke saansad sanjay raut ne kaha he ki jo log sargical strike ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai, unke khilaaf deshadroh kaa maamla darj hona chahie
 He said this during a press conference in Lucknow on Wednesday
 lekin sanjay raut ne saath main yah bhi kaha ki sargical strike ko lekar sena par bharosa kiya janaa chahie, magar iskaa raajnneetik istemaal bilkul nahin hona chahie
 Sanjay Raut has raised the bjp's concern by saying that Shiv Sena will contest 200 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 shivasena kaa uttar pradesh main koi janaadhar nahin he, lekin iske baavjood kattar hindutv vaali party ko lekar uski pahchaan he or bijepi ko isse kuch jagahon par nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The BJP is not directly seeking votes in the name of Hindutva in the Uttar Pradesh elections, but by constantly raising issues like Kairana and Dadri, the BJP is sending a message to its voters
 uttar pradesh main chunaav ko dekhte hue hi pradhanmantri narendra modi pehali baar dashahara ke maukey par dilli ke ramlila maidan ke bajaay lakhanu ke eshbagh ramlila maidan main aakar ravan vadh ke kaarykram main hissaa lenge
 The 'clear image of Akhilesh': The leaders of the BJP have been continuously roaming around in Uttar Pradesh to unleash the Samajwadi Party government, but Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has praised Akhilesh Yadav
 sanjay ravat ne lakhanu main kaha ki akhilesh yadav vikaas kaa kaam karne main lage hai, lekin unki party main parivaarwaad haaavee he, jisaki vajah se vah kaam nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Raut said that Akhilesh Yadav is a leader with a clean image
 raut par phenki thi syaahimangalvaar ko hi lakhanu main sanjay raut par shivasena ke hi do kaaryakartaaon ne ink phenkaa tha
 These activists belonged to two different factions of the Shiv Sena, due to a mutual fight, they confronted Sanjay Rawat
 200 siton par chunaav ladane kii shivasena kii ghoshnaa se bijepi isliye bhi chintaa main pad gai hogi kyonki party kaa janaadhar nahin hone kii vajah se shivasena ke paas apane ummidavaar nahin honge
 In such a situation, the BJP will be afraid that the Shiv Sena should not field the BJP leaders by holding the ticket of the Shiv Sena, angry that the ticket is not available

 The MRO Association of India has warned that if this discrepancy is not rectified, the industry may be shut down

 In Sri Lanka, there is no tax on this industry
 association ke sansthaapak mahasachiv pulak sen ne kaha ki airlines ko rakrakhaav ke liye vimaan videsh bhejnaa sasta pad rahaa he
 He said that the cost benefit that the MRO industry was getting due to cheap labor in India has ended due to the burden of GST
 bharat main shram kii laagat 20 se 35 dollar prati ghanta baithti he
 He cited the example of countries like Singapore and Malaysia where seven per cent GST is levied

 mujhe to ishaara tak nahin kiya gaya
 In this case, i will give the center number 110 out of 100
 ajtak par audio sunaane par rajyapal ne kaha ki wo baat maine kisi or sandarbh main kahi thi
 Kavindra said - To remain in the headlines, on the statement of Governor, former Deputy Chief Minister of the state Kavindra Gupta said that there was no pressure on the Governor
 ve sirf surkhiyon main bane rahane ke liye aisa bayaan de rahe
 National Conference said - Center de Explanation: In this case, National Conference leader Devendra Rana said that this is a very serious matter
 centre sarkaar ko is maamle main apana rukh saaf karnaa chahie
 Why did the Center want to make Sajjad the Chief Minister, who does not have the required number

 Making Bhagwat the head of the saffron family fond of keeping in touch with the media reveals generational and cultural changes in the Sangh
 ve aadhuniktaavaadi hai, sangh kaa 21veen sadi kaa cheharaa
 When the BJP seems to be overthrowing its core ideology for coalition politics, Bhagwat has once again made Hindutva a national agenda
 bhaajapa main jis samay ek aise netaa kii kami mahasoos kii ja rahi he, jo party ko haar kii chot se ubaar sake, sangh ke chathe sarasanghachaalak sabase bade maardarshak or budhimaan salaahkaar ban gaye hai
 As the party is disappearing from the national public, Bhagwat is emerging as the ultimate pioneer of nationalism
 party ke mahatvakankshi lekin mahatvaheen sabit ho chuke netaa jab parajeet yuddh ke avasheshon par jhagad rahe hai, bhagwat unhen samaj rahe hai ki sudhar jaao varanaa khatm ho jaaoge
 He is an unmarried Brahmin of Chandrapur in Maharashtra
 unhen bhagava parivaar ko bachaane ke liye puure vivekpurna dhang se faisla karnaa hoga
 Bhagwat, along with editor Prabhu Chawla, spoke openly on a wide range of topics ranging from bjp's future leadership to Vande Mataram, Chidambaram to Modi to Pakistan to China to the Aaj Tak Show Sidhi Baat at the RSS office of Jhandewalan in Delhi
 baatcheet ke mukhya anshahvandemaataram ke khilaaf devband kii pratikriya par aap kya sochate hai?vandemaataram sabhi bharatiyon ke liye he
 It was part of our freedom movement and history
 ek samay vah bhi tha jab hindu or musalmaan ise milakar gaate the
 Muslims say that it is against their religion
 main nahin samajhataa ki koi bhi majahab deshbhakti ke khilaaf he
 Saying Bharat Mata ki Jai and Vande Mataram is not any religious worship or idol worship
 sangh kaa najariya kya he?(mej thapthapa kar ) vande maataram kahana hoga
 Do you believe that the minorities are scared after the mosque was demolished? i would say that the government had neglected the sentiments of Hindu society
 vyavastha ke khilaaf gussa us dhaanche par utaara gaya
 But minorities feel insecure with your strong views on Babri Masjid, Uniform Civil Code and Article 370
 mujhe bataaie ki aise muddon par koi thos baatcheet kyon nahin kii jaati
 There has been no court decision (on the Ram temple) for the last 90 years
 or jab kuch nahin hota he to aam aadmi apana santulan kho detaa he
 V
 pi
 Singh gave the formula to build both a temple and a mosque in Ayodhya
 ek jimmedaar sanghathan ke bataur aap kuch udaartaa kyon nahin dikhaate?isse ekta nahin aegi
 If the Ram temple is built peacefully, it will end the hindu-muslim conflict
 ek hi jagah par masjid nahin banaai ja sakati
 Let them build a mosque somewhere else, and Hindus will give all possible help in it
 congress ne sikh virdohi dangon ke liye maafee maangi or adwani ne kaha ki babari vidhwans ek rashtriya shame thi
 The Sangh did not say 'drop the structure'
 ' adalati faisle kii deree ne logon ko naaraaz kar diya
 Do you agree with Advani that it was national shame? i do not agree with Advani on this issue
 unhone car seva kii vaid anumati kyon nahin di, jabaki kitne hi log iske liye ikatthe hue the?sangh aisa kuch kyon nahin karnaa chahta jisase alpsankhyak khud ko surakshit mahasoos karen? gujarat main jo kuch hua, usne sangh or alpsankhyakon ke bich duuri ore badha di?hinsa galat he, chaahe vah kahin bhi ho
 Do not see only one side
 godhra main jo kuch hua, vah bhi nahin hona chahie tha
 Nobody talks about the killings in Godhra
 kya narendra modi ko gujarat dangon ke liye maafee maangani chahie?ve ek pradesh ke mukhiya hai
 They have full knowledge of what happened there
 ve apni pratikriya dene main samarth hai
 If they feel that something worth apologizing has happened, they will apologize
 iskaa mujhe puraa vishwaas he
 i have also been told that the rate at which the riots were controlled is very commendable
 agar unhone koi galati nahin kii he to maafee kyon maangi jaae? aisa to nahin hota
 Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh were not responsible for the 1984 riots, but they have apologized
 isse unka kad badhata he
 If Modi or RSS do this then they will benefit
 us samay kaha gaya tha ki jab koi bada ped girtaa he to kuch to hoga hi
 Such a statement was never made in Gujarat
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki aresas is mudde par kabhi samajhaita nahin karegaa?bharat kii ekta or akhandta par koi samajhaita nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Similarly, there is no Ram temple in Ayodhya and similar civil code
 agar main thik samajhataa hum, to aap ab bhi akhand bharat main vishwaas karte hai, na ki dvirashtra ke siddhaat main
 It is all part of India
 pakistan asthaayee he, jo der-saver bharat kaa ang ban jayega
 What about Afghanistan? Pakistan and Afghanistan are our parts and they will return one day
 aapkaa kahana he ki aresas kaa bhaajapa par koi niyantran nahin he
 But it sent 35 pracharaks to BJP and they report to you
 yah anivaary nahin he ki ve hamen report den
 We want them to stick to their principles
 ham unke kaamkaaj main dakhlandaji nahin karte
 There have been reports of RSS pressure on BJP
 vasundhara raaje ko aresas ke dabaav ke kaaran hataaya gaya
 The RSS had nothing to do with this
 yah bhaajapa kaa andruni masalaa he
 Four months ago you talked about a change in BJP leadership
 bhaajapa teen rajyon main chunaav haar gai or kisi badlaav kaa sanket nahin dikh rahaa he
 Change will definitely come but on its own time
 maine vahi kaha jo mujhe (bhaajapa dwaara) bataaya gaya tha
 He has his plan in mind and is running
 aisi pakki manyata he ki aresas bhaajapa main dakhlandaji kar rahaa he or khud ko uske upar thope rahaa he
 The RSS never intervenes, only advises when asked for
 lekin aapane kaha he ki nayaa netaa in chaar logon (sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu or anant kumaar) ke alaava koi hoga
 Yes, the new leadership will be different from these four people
 mujhe yahi bataaya gaya he
 It has been agreed and i think the process has started
 vah netaa dilli se baahar kaa 50-55 varsh kii umr vaala hoga
 They will bring a leader from outside Delhi
 pichley paanch-chah varshon main kuch log, jo media kii paidaaish the or jinka sangh se koi judaav nahin tha, bhaajapa main mahatvapurn ho gaye the
 Has this led to a lightening of ideology? The Sangh is not against anyone
 ham yah nahin dekhte ki vah swayamsevak he yaa nahin
 Are you worried about the volunteers in the BJP who have an image of corruption? Politics is a slippery ground
 lekin ham nahin chaahate ki hamaara koi swayamsevak phisale
 We talk to them but it is the job of the BJP to take action against them
 bhaajapa sangh parivaar kaa pratyaksh cheharaa he
 Are you worried about this when you send workers to the party? They are influenced by the tendency of individual worship and leaders become more important than the organization? Yes, we are worried and we talk to them about it too
 kya aap is baat ko praathamikta denge ki party kaa netritv aise aadmi ko diya jaae jo aresas kii vichaardhaara main vishwaas rakhata ho?netaa koun hoga, iskaa faisla party karegi
 We just want the leader to be the one who takes our ideology forward, believes in teamwork, encourages the new generation
 or yah saaf dikhe ki party agar 'dusron se ek alag party' he to kyon he
 There are some organizations that are not part of the union
 phir bhi unhen iskaa hissaa mana jaataa he jaise karnataka kii shriram sene, pragna thakur
 Why don't you separate them from the RSS? i have already said that we have nothing to do with Shriram Sene
 hindu aatankwaad jaisi koi cheez nahin he
 No Hindu will support terrorism

 raajnneetik partiyaan ise lekar satark mod main aa gai hai
 Every party is appealing to their leaders to forget their differences and come together
 lekin bhartiya janata party(bijepi) ke dakshini dilli se saansad ramesh bidhudi, party ke soshal media or dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 On the occasion of social media meet of Delhi BJP, it seemed from their talk that everything is not going well in Delhi BJP
 saansadon ke bich anban kii ek baangi is meeting main dekhne ko mil gai
 The meeting was attended by Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari, Social Media Head Neelkant Bakshi, Anurag Thakur, Delhi BJP General Secretary Kuljit Chahal besides Parliamentarian Ramesh Bidhuri from South Delhi
 soshal media meet ke dauraan saansad ramesh bidhudi ne manoj tiwari or soshal media team par ishaaron hi ishaaron main aalochana kii or tanj bhi ksaa
 Ramesh Bidhuri said, 'prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity is huge through the work and social media of thousands of workers
 hamaare kiye hue kaam soshal media ke madhyam se jan jan tak pahunche hai
 All of you are working on social media with an ideology
 bijepi 20 varsh ke baad punah dilli main aae isaliye kaam kar rahen hai
 But when we leave a thought and become person based, those things do more harm
 ramesh bidhudi ne kaha, 'vyakti aadhaarit hone ke baad ham usko pramot karen acchhee baat he
 But do it by showing that your opponent is finished and if you promote you then there is trouble
 hamaari soshal media main mujhe pichley 6-8 maheene se bahut dekhne ko mila he
 We could have gone even further
 57 fisadi kii jagah 62 fisadi vot dilli main laa sakate the
 Could have told the country that BJP has won a historic victory in Delhi
 'unhone kaha, 'party ke netritv ko sochna he, jo sochna he
 Criticizing your social media will do nothing
 party netritv ko sab pataa he ki koun acha kar rahaa he, koun kya kar rahaa he
 What will happen to our thinking? ”he said,“ If Ramesh Bidhuri is to be hit, what will happen to him? The party is also choking along
 party kii ek seat kam ho rahi he
 But what will you get? You will get praise from him only when your government comes to power
 par kahin na kahin ham apane score settle karne ke liye party ke platform kaa upyog karte hai
 The heads of social media will have to pay attention to this
 haalanki manoj ji yahaan baithe hai or ye bhi satya he ki wo mujhase zyada sahamat nahin rahete
 Ramesh Bidhuri said that social media has its own importance it is not that the schemes were not implemented in the previous government
 par un yojanaon kaa laabh janata tak pahunchaana sabase badi chunauti thi
 But today bjp's plans are reaching the people through social media
 logon ko un yojanaon kaa laabh mil rahaa he
 Ramesh Bidhuri said, “in South Delhi, people who ate bread for years in the name of the party went on a broom and the people who worked on the land are in the party itself
 kya laabh mila kuch nahin
 Those who had to understand, they understood, those who did not understand were clumsy
 'ramesh bidhudi ke is bayaan ke baad se bijepi kii andruni ekta par sawaal uthne laazmi hai
 In such a situation, now it is to be seen whether the top leadership of BJP can resolve the differences going on in the party before the election
 aaj kii siyasat main soshal media ke bina netaaon kaa guzaara nahin he

 The Supreme Court quashed the allocation of 214 out of 218 coal blocks allocated to various companies since 1993
 pradhan nyaayadhish aaram lodha kii adhyakshata vaali teen-sadasyeey khandpeeth ne sirf chaar koyala blokon kaa aavanton radd nahin kiya
 Among the coal blocks left out of the cancellation, one block each of NTPC and SAIL and two blocks have been given for very large power projects
 court ne is faisle se companiyon ko sarkaar ke rajasav ke nuksaan kii bharpai karne kaa nirdesh diya, jinhone abhi tak koyala nikasi kaa kaam chaalu nahin kiya tha
 The court accepted the cag's conclusion that there was a loss of revenue at the rate of Rs 295 per tonne due to non-commissioning of production in these coal blocks
 court ne kaha ki sirf sarkari kol block bache rahenge
 The court had declared 218 coal blocks illegal, of which 214 have been canceled
 iske saath hi chaalu ho chuke 46 kol blokon ko bhi raahat nahin di gai he, alabatta unhen chah maah main kaamkaaj sametanaa hoga
 Earlier on August 25, the Supreme Court had given the historic verdict, since 1993, all coal allocation was declared illegal
 apane faisle main supreme court kaha tha ki ye saare aavanton manamaane dhang se kiye
 In the last two decades, 36 screening committees have allocated coal blocks illegally and arbitrarily
 naa hi ye aavanton paardarshee the or naa hi sahi dhang se kiye gaye
 However, the Central Government had filed an affidavit demanding not to cancel the allocation of 46 coal blocks
 gauratlab he ki kol block kaa maamla bhale manmohan sarkaar ke samay kaa uchhla, lekin jaanch puure daur kii hui
 213 coal blocks from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh were allocated between 1993 and 2010
 court ne suzav diya ki maamla arthvyavastha se judaa he isliye iske liye supreme court ke ritred jaj kii adhyakshata main ek cameti kaa gathan ho
 The Supreme Court held further hearing and reserved its decision on 9 September
 1 sitambar ko hui sunwaayee ke dauraan bharat sarkaar kii taraf se atorni general mukul rohtagi ne supreme court main kaha ki court saare aavanton radd kar detaa he to bhi sarkaar taiyaar he, lekin ho sake to un 46 blox ko chhod diya jaae jo yaa to shuru ho chuke hai yaa shuru hone vaale hai
 a fine of Rs 295 per ton can be charged for this
 court is maamle main fouran aadesh jari kare or koi cameti na banaae
 The electricity situation in the country is not good and in such a situation, re-allocation is necessary
 9 sitambar ko sunwaayee main centre sarkaar ne kaha ki saare aavanton radd kar die jaaen or jo blox chal rahe hai, unhen kol india ke hawaale kiye jaae yaa 2ji spectrum kii tarj par jab tak nae aavanton nahin hote 46 kol blokon ko chalane diya jaae
 During the hearing, companies related to mining also submitted their views in the Supreme Court

 a committee should be formed to discuss this with every company

 koyala or bijli mantralay ne apane karypradarshan main tamaam tarah ke daawey kiye hai
 According to the ministry, power generation has reached the highest in a year to 1,000 billion units
 iske saath hi ab tak ke itihaas main sabase kambijli killatarhi he
 The Ministry also claims that coal production 3
 2 karod ton badha he
 It is found by investigating this that most of the claims are exaggerated
 
 
 
 1
 bijli utpaadan sabase zyada badhaadaava : mantralay ke mutabik bijliutpaadan kshamtakisi bhi saal ke mukaable sabase zyada badhkar 22,550 megawatt ke kareeb he
 Truth: Power generation was close to 20,500 MW in 2011-12 and 20,600 MW in 2012-13
 haalanki sabase zyada badhat 2010-12 ke bich 8,340 megawatt ke kareeb hui thi
 2
 itihaas main pehali baar 1,000 arab unit bijli utpaadandaava : desh ke itihaas main pehali baar 1,000 arab unit bijli utpaadan
 Truth: Production close to 770 billion units in 2009-10 and 960 billion units in 2013-14
 is paanch saal main utpaadan 200 arab unit badha, jo kareeb 25 fisadi kii badhat he
 Therefore, to reach 1,000 billion units, only 33 billion units of additional production was needed
 3
 Power shortage was the lowest: shortfall was around 3 and a half percent, which is the lowest ever
 sachai : 2006-10 main killat kareeb 10 fisadi thi, jo 2013-14 main ghatakar kareeb 4 fisadi rah gai
 So reaching 0 and a half per cent is just 0
 6 fisadi kii giravat he
 4
 pawan urja kshamta main ullekhneey badhatadaava : 2014-15 main kareeb 2,300 megawattpavan bijli kshamtathi, jo 2013-14 ke mukaable kaaphi zyada he
 Truth: 2010-12 produced far more capacity
 5
 Significant increase in small hydro power projects: 251 MW capacity was installed in 2014-15 as against 171 MW a year ago
 sachai : 2011-12 main 352 megawatt kshamta sthapit hui jabaki ek saal baad ghatakar 237 megawatt kshamta sthapit hui thi
 6
 koyala utpaadan chaar saal main sabase zyadadava : 2014-15 main kareeb 3 karod ton badhat ke saath kul utpaadan kareeb 49 karod ton tha jo 2013-14 main 46 karod ton ke kareeb tha
 Truth: The Ministry has reported about 46 million tonnes of production for 2013-14, while the Coal Minister said that in 2013-14, about 56 million tonnes have been produced
 isse bhi jaruri baat yah he ki 2014-15 main utpaadan kareeb 49 karod ton rahaa jo ki isse pehle ke paanch saal main prayek saal ke utpaadan se kam he

 Narendra Modi's development among Muslims, especially OBC Muslims across Delhi, should portray the image of a man
 unhen bharosa dilaaein kii jis tarah gujarat kaa musalmaan tarakkee kar rahaa he narendra modi ke piem banane ke baad barabari ke adhikaar ke saath desh kaa har musalmaan tarakkee karegaa
 BJP Minority Morcha president Atif Rashid said, "we will not pressurize Muslims wearing caps and beards to come to the rally, but it will request that such people reach more and more number because it identifies the community
" 'dilli bijepi kii pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha, 'gujarat main musalamaanon ne tarakkee kii he, ab desh kii baari he, isiilie muslim modi ji kii raily main aaenge, topi or burka pahanakar aaenge, is par koi pabandi thodi he, muslimon ko bhi lagata he ki modi hi unki tarakkee kara sakate hai
 According to sources, BJP has targeted to bring 25,000 Muslims to Modi's rally
 iske liye har jile ko 2000 logon kaa target diya gaya he
 The party's effort is that at least 5,000 women wearing burqas must attend the rally so that the message is clear that minorities are no longer avoiding Modi
 dilli bijepi kii koshish he ki modi kii raily main musalmaan na sirf aaen, balki musalmaan aae hai ye dikhnaa bhi chahie
 Now whatever its motive is, but the big question is still whether Modi will be able to make a place in the heart of Muslims with this exercise
 darasal, jab se modi bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar bane hai tabhi se aisi koshishen ho rahi hai ki gujarat ke sardaar ko alpsankhyakon ke kareeb laayaa ja sake
 If the Muslims were specially invited to Jaipur rally, similar arrangements are being made for Bhopal and Delhi rally
 yahi nahin bijepi alpsankhyakon ke liye ek vijan document bhi laane ja rahi he
 The message is clear
 
 
 ek yojana ke tahat modi ke saath alpsankhyakon ko dikhaane kii koshish ho rahi he kyonki sawaal dilli kaa he or bijepi hi nahin modi ko bhi pataa he ki dilli gujarat nahin he
 However, the BJP and its allies categorically deny any such mission
 ye netaa kuch bhi kahen lekin haal kii kavayad main modi kaa mishan em saaf najar aa rahaa he
 BJP has a rally in Bhopal on 25th
 yahaan bhi alpsankhyak morcha kii taraf se muslimon se burka topi main aane kii apil kii gai he
 a 10-point decree has been issued for the September 29 rally in Delhi
 makasad saaf he, musalmaan naa sirf raily main pahunche balki tivi ke camaron main unki maujuudagi najar bhi aae taaki bhartiya siyasat main modi kii badhati sweekaaryakarta ko dikhaaya ja sake
 The BJP could tearfully say that no one is avoiding Modi, the development man
 kahin modi do naavon kii sawari to nahin kar rahe?modi kii chhavi kattar hinduvadi netaa kii rahi he or wo isse kabhi parhez bhi nahin karte
 But, the exercise that is going on by the party about his rallies, is it not so that Modi is riding two boats
 saalon se gadhi gai chhavi bhi bani rahe or ruthaa hua vot bank bhi saath aa jaae
 Gujarat's CM Narendra Modi has never been like other leaders even in politics
 chaahe kaisaa bhi dabaav ho apni pahchaan se unhone kabhi samjhauta nahin kiya
 There was criticism about the Gujarat riots
 aalochak maafee kii maang karte rahe lekin modi ne naa to maafee maangi naa hi khud ko hindutv kaa jhandabardaar hone se inkaar kiya
 - The question arises, with great criticism from the opponents, the image that Modi has worked hard, he is going to break that image? Modi? Significantly, Advani, the bjp's PM in waiting, tried to improve his staunch image by calling Jinnah a secularist in Pakistan
 lekin, modi ke maamle main khaas baat ye he ki ab tak unhone khud to aisa koi bayaan dene se parhez kiya hi, jab bhi mauka mila khud ko hindutv ke poster bvoy ke rup pesh karne kaa mauka nahin choda
 On the one hand, on every occasion, to try to strengthen the image of his Hindu nationalist, on the other hand, the party's exercise to mobilize minorities in Modi's rally, Narendra Modi is not riding two boats? To maintain the polarization of votes through image and on the other hand by showing the picture of Gujarat's development, through its partners, to convey the message that when the minority of Gujarat needs Modi Hedge not then others are why the problem? Modi's mission is clear
 vikaas purush kii chhavi ke jariye har tabake main paith bananaa
 It is also necessary to fulfill the dream of becoming PM

 Despite being isolated, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, who is surrounded by controversies, has not given up his stance and refused to resign from his post today while also threatening to 'expose some' who are trying to discredit the game
 
 bisisiai ke aalaa adhikari jab unhen pad se hataane kii ranneeti banane ke liye baithkon kar rahe hai tab modi ne peeche hatane kaa koi sanket nahin diya he or twitor par unhone apane iraade jaahir kar diye hai
 BCCI President Shashank Manohar, Vice President Arun Jaitley, Secretary n Srinivasan, IPL Vice President Niranjan Shah, Finance and Media Committee Chairman Rajiv Shukla and Chief Administrative Officer Ratnakar Shetty were present at the meeting
 manohar ne baithak ke baad intjaar kar rahe samvaaddaaton se kaha, ‘‘faisla 26 april ko sanchaalan parishad kii baithak main kiya jayega
 "modi has written on his Twitter page," People are pressuring me to resign
 main aapse kah saktaa hum ki aisa nahin hoga
 Let them remove me
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘hamane pichley chaar saal main jo kiya he vah sabake saamne he
 No one can take the credit for this
 ’’ modi ne apane virodhiyon ko dhamkee dete hue kaha ,‘‘ ipel khatm ho jane dijiye 
 i will expose those who are trying to discredit the game and how we prevented them from doing so
 ’’ipel or isaki frenchygiyon par iskar vibhaag ke chaape ke baad kathith taur par modi dwaara vittiya aniyamittaaon kaa khulaasa hua he
 He, however, reprimanded the media for publishing the financial transaction news without confirmation
 unhone likhaa, ‘‘media bina pushti kiye khabaren chalaa rahi he jisase pataa chalata he ki kaise media apane adhikaar kaa galat istemaal karti he
 Don't be affected by all these baseless news
 sach jald hi saamne aayega
 Not getting a chance to try trial and facts by the media is like jungle raj
 intjaar kiijie or tathy saamne aaenge
 "modi has made it clear in his tweet that he is not in the mood to give up without a struggle and has created a confrontational role with top BCCI officials
" isse pehle bisisiai ne aaj sanchaalan parishad ko paanch din sthagit karne kii unki bhavuk apil thukraa di
 Now, with two days left for the Governing Council meeting, the verbal war between the two sides seems to be getting worse as no one is ready to back down
 chaudaa sadasyeey sanchaalan parishad main jab modi ke kaaphi kam samarthak bache hai tab vijay maalya (royal chalangers bangalore), shilpa shetty (rajasthan rails) or jai mehta (kolkata nite rides) ke rup main kuch frenchiji maalik unke samarthan main aage aaye hai
 Earlier, top officials of the BCCI held several meetings during which there was speculation that Modi might be persuaded to voluntarily step down
 lekin din dhalate dhalate yah saaf ho gaya in prayaason kaa koi fal nahin milane vaala kyonki modi dabaav ke aage jhukne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Earlier in the morning, Mallya met Union Minister and former BCCI President Sharad Pawar at his residence
 haalanki yah pataa nahin chalaa ki donon ke bich kya charchaa hui lekin maalya ne modi kaa samarthan kiya
 He said, "I think Modi should get a chance to present his case
" sara vivaad gairajaruri tufaan ban gaya he
 Yes, one can ask that there are some questions about the way the IPL is being run
 saaf he ki sanchaalan parishad ke kuch sadsy shaayad khush nahin hon
 Let it be properly investigated
 ’’ is tarah kii apusht report hai ki pavaar chaahate hai ki bisisiai modi ko sammanit vidaai den lekin bisisiai ke kisi adhikari ne isaki pushti nahin kii he
 The award ceremony last night in Mumbai was boycotted by top BCCI officials and most members of the Governing Council, which marked an anti-modi stance in the BCCI
 bisisiai adhikari kal ipel final kaa bahishkaar karne kii bhi yojana bana rahe hai
 BCCI sources said that the chairman has the right to remove Modi as per the constitution of the board and resorting to this option will not create any legal hurdle

 Kejriwal from Bahadurgarh, situated on the Haryana Delhi border, took a road-wide convoy of vehicles with workers and walked towards his village Sewani
 bahadurgard main kejariwal kaa aam aadmi party kaaryakartaaon ne dhol-nagaadon ke saath swaagat kiya
 When the convoy moved forward, the activists left no stone unturned to welcome the Chief Minister of Delhi by placing flag posters and canopy at many places along the way

 Addressing the workers at AAP headquarters in Rohtak, Kejriwal asked to be prepared for Haryana elections
 kejariwal ne kaaryakartaaon ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki vah ghar ghar jaakar sanghathan kaa kaam majboot karen or agle chunaav ke liye taiyaariyaan karen kyonki unki party ke paas paise nahin hai
 The biggest reason behind Kejriwal's intentions to make his political land in Fungahariana the election bugle is his Haryanvi
 hisar raily main bhi kejariwal ne logon se yahi kaha ki vah apni janmabhumi par aae hai, jiskaa vah karj utaarenge
 Now in the morning, when the bugle of fighting elections broke out, Kejriwal remembered his birthplace within 1 week
 jaahir he kejariwal haryana main apana hariyaanvi card khelenge or party ke netaa bhi is baat se inkaar nahin karte
 Aam Aadmi Party's Haryana in-charge Naveen Jaihind says that Kejriwal is from Haryana and if he is born, then why not contest elections in his state? Outside Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party was able to spread its foot in Punjab only
 aise main dilli ke kareeb hone kaa phayda aam aadmi party ko haryana main dikhaai pad rahaa he

 *** The political equations of assembly elections in Karnataka are being set
 bijepi satta main apni vaapasi ke liye bies yediurppa ke chehre ko aage karke utari he
 While the face of Congress in Karnataka is not the party president Rahul Gandhi but CM Siddaramaiah himself
 siddharmaiya rajya main apni satta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye ek ke baad ek siyaasi bisaat bichaane main jute hai
 The Congress has used five such weapons in the state, in which the BJP is completely trapped and the battle of Karnataka does not look so easy for it
 1
 The status of Lingayat as a separate religion Just before the assembly elections in Karnataka, the Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah has run a masterstroke by demanding that the Lingayat community be given a separate religion status
 lingayat samudaay ke log lambey samay se maang kar rahe the ki unhen hindu dharm se alag dharm kaa darja diya jaae
 The Government of Karnataka approved the recommendations of the Nagmohan Committee under Section 2D of the State Minorities Commission Act
 ab isaki antim manjuuri ke liye gend centre sarkaar ke paale main daal diya he
 Around 18% of the Lingayat community population in the state is considered to be the kingmaker
 yediurppa ke lingayat samudaay se aane ke chalate bijepi kaa ye majboot votbank mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the Congress has tried to breach by giving different religion status
 bijepi kaa virodh lingayat kii naaraazgi kii vajah ban saktaa he
 2
 congress ke sang majboot muslim votbankkarnataka main musalamaanon kii aabaadi kareeb 13 fisadi he
 Congress is believed to have a strong hold on this vote bank
 mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main musalamaanon ko baqayda saadhe rakhaa he
 North Karnataka is dominated by Muslims
 khaskar gulberga, bidar, bijapur, raichur or dharwar jaise ilaakon main muslim vot nirnaayak bhoomika main rahata he
 Out of the total 224 seats in the state assembly, about 60 are considered to be Muslim voters
 dakshin kannada, dharwar, gulberga wo ilaake hai jahaan 20 fisadi se zyada muslim voter hai
 It is also important that there are more number of Muslims in urban areas here
 shahari kshetron main kareeb 21 fisadi or gramin kshetron main kareeb 8 fisadi muslim jansankhya he
 Siddaramaiah is constantly trying to win the hearts of Muslims by sharply criticizing the RSS and BJP
 pichley dinon unhone bijepi, aresas or bajrang dal ko aatankwaadi bataaya tha
 Not only this, he has compared BJP with Kauravas while referring to Mahabharata
 iske alaava congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or siddharmaiya donon netaa rajya main muslim dharmik sthalon par bhi baqayda ja rahe hai
 3
 karnataka kaa alag jhandakarnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi baaji apane naam karne ke liye mukhyamantri siddharmaiya koi kor kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 The issue of territoriality is very important in South India
 siddharmaiya ne is baat ko bakhubi samajhate hue karnataka ke liye ek alag jhande kaa dizin rajya cabinet se paas karaayaa he
 Now he has put it in the court of the central government for constitutional approval
 laal, safed or pile rang kii pattee se bane is dhvaj ko ‘naad dhvaj’ naam diya gaya he
 In the middle of this flag, a two-headed mythological bird named 'gandha Bherunda' is placed in the middle of this flag
 4
 The caste equation of the Congress: Siddaramaiah has tried to improve the caste equation in a better way to save his fort in Karnataka
 bijepi ke lingayat votbank main send lagaaya
 Being an OBC community themselves, the state has a strong hold on the vote bank of the backward community
 soobe main kareeb 40 fisadi ke upar obisi samudaay he
 Apart from this, Mallikarjun Kharge of Congress is doing the exercise to control 20 percent Dalit vote of the state
 khadge congress kaa dalit cheharaa hai or loksabhaa main pratipaksh ke netaa
 Apart from this, 13 Muslim voters of the state are united with the Congress
 5
 The Supreme Court's decision to provide more water to the Kaveri river to the farmers has added to the decision on the Cauvery, making the political path of Siddaramaiah more easy
 kaveri belt ke jilon main congress ko iskaa raajnneetik phayda milegaa
 The decision on Kaveri will help in bringing the farmers closer to Congress
 iske alaava siddharmaiya apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main kisaanon ko lekar kaaphi meharbaan rahe hai
 The farmers of the state waived loans up to Rs 50,000
 siddharmaiya ne is baar ke bajet main sinchai suvidha rahit kisaanon kii madad ke liye 'raiyat belaku' yojana kii bhi ghoshnaa kii he, jisamen varsha par nirbhar kheti karne vaale prayek kisaan ko adhiktam 10,000 rupee or nunatam 5,000 rupee prati hectare ke hisaab se raashi kii sahaayta sidhe unke bank khaaton main daali jaaegi
 This is expected to benefit about 70 lakh farmers

 dilliko badi teji se badalane kii aadat pad gai he
 The same thing is evident in the mood of the voters in Delhi before the Anna movement and in post-delhi
 oktober 2013 main hue vidhansabha chunaav or uske baad april 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main dilli ke voter ke mizaaj main itnaa chamatkaari badlaav aayaa jo isse pehle lambey samay se kam se kam dilli main to nahin hi dekha gaya
 So will the Delhi voter take a big swing once again in the February 2015 assembly elections or will the BJP sitting on the peak of the votes win the fun
 chunavi daavon or aarope-pratyarope se pare jaraa kuch aankadon par najar daalen
 When Sheila Dikshit hoisted the Congress in Delhi for the third time in 2008, the Congress got 40
 31 fisadi vot mili the or bijepi ko 36
 84 percent votes were received
 isi chunaav main mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party ko 14
 5 percent of the voles were found
 haalanki basapa ke khate main siten na ke baraabar thim
 But when Delhi went to the polls in October 2013, which was churned during the Anna movement, the voter changed his mood for 15 years in a jolt
 congress ke vot main 16 fisadi kii tej giravat ai or vah 24
 Reduced to 55 per cent
 bijepi kii siten badhin lekin uskaa vot ghatakar 33 fisadi rah gaya
 The bsp's vote bank was completely cleared
 or arvindakejarivalki aam aadmi party bhartiya raajnneetik kii nai kism kii kranti ke taur par 29
 It emerged as the second major force with 49 per cent of the votes
 kejariwal is chunaav kii khoj rahe
 But after six months when the Lok Sabha elections were held in Delhi, the mood changed completely
 bijepi ne dilli main apane sarvshereshth pradarshnon main se ek hasil karte hue vot share main 13 fisadi kii oochaal lagaai
 46 to the party in Modi wave
 1 fisadi vot mili
 The vote of the Aam Aadmi Party increased marginally by three percent
 lekin dilli kii saat main se saat siton par kabiz congress aundhe munh giri or uskaa vot share 9
 5 percent and reduced to just 15 percent
 do chunaav main congress 40 se 15 fisadi par aa gai
 The BSP did not appear in the arena again
 ab nau maheene baad dilli phir chunaav ke maidan main he
 In the last two elections, Delhi has shown a trend of giving up on one party completely
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nazariye se dekhen to bijepi or aam aadmi party ke vot share main 13 fisadi kaa bada antar he
 Even if the Modi wave has already slowed down, will the voter leave the party together? congress pehle hi diwaar se lag chuki he, aise main uske vot share main or sendhamari kii gunjaaish aam aadmi party ke paas nahin he
 It may be that Ajay Maken might have added something to it
 lekin do chunaav se voter ke munh main jis tarah badi swing karne kaa swaad lag chukaa he, aise main is baar bhi kuch na kuch to swing hoga
 The fate of Delhi's plank tower depends on the width of this swing
 jis tarah kashmir or jharkhand main modi lahar ke mand padane ke sanket dikhe hai or 10 janvari kii modi raily main ummid se kaaphi kam log aae, usamen dilli ke liye kuch na kuch sabak to chupa he
 In such a situation, whatever is at stake belongs to the BJP

 unhone vidheyak main alpsankhyak cote kii vyavastha karne or lokapal ke daayre se kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ko baahar rakhane par aapatti uthaai
 Jaitley told the government that if she wants the bill to be passed in the upper house, she should accept the bjp's amendments
 unhone kaha ki vidheyak kaa vah praavdhaan jo rajyon ko centre sarkaar ke adarsh par lokayuktaon kii niyukti anivaary banaata he, spasht nahin he or isse centre or rajya ke adhikaar ek-duusare se takaraayenge
 At the same time, Singhvi dismissed Jaitley's allegations and asked that the fundamental question is whether you want to pass the Lokpal Bill or not? sadan main sarkaar kaa paksh rakhte hue singhvi ne bhaajapa kaa is mudde par rukh spasht nahin hone kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Singhvi said, "the BJP is stuck in the bill in a critical situation and is saying that it wants a strong and comprehensive bill
 vah is sthiti ko vidheyak ko paas nahin karaane ke liye bahaane ke rup main istemaal kar rahi he
 " congress netaa ne kaha, "sibiai 70 saal puraani sanstha he
 Will every institution be automatically destroyed by the arrival of Lokpal? " singhvi ne kaha ki bhaajapa acolpaneey anupaat vaala ek vishalkay satta banani chaahati he jiske saamne pradhanmantri karyaalay 'bouna' jaisaa dikhe
 Satish Chandra Mishra of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should not be under the government
 jabaki marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ke netaa seetaram yechuri ne pesh vidheyak ko kamjor bataaya
 At the same time, Prashant Bhushan, a prominent member of Team Anna and senior advocate of the Supreme Court, said, "from what i have seen during the discussion in Rajya Sabha, i do not think that the Lokpal Bill will be passed
 " This morning when a passenger viewer sent a screen shot of the railway time table that 15212 Jannayak Express running between Amritsar to Darbhanga was 57 hours late, i could not believe it
 44 ghante tak let chalane vaali train se saamana ho chukaa tha magar 57 ghante train chalati hogi, is soochna ko grahan karne kii maansik taiyaari nahin thi
 Jannayak Express runs between Amritsar to Darbhanga
 isamen sari bogi general hoti he, kyonki isse bihar ke mazdoor punjab mazaduri karne jate hai
 The time of the workers of India is not worth it
 darbhanga se khulne vaali jananaayak express somvaar ko radd kar di gai
 Even on Tuesday, it has been delayed for 3 hours
 general bogi main jisamen koi suvidha nahin hoti he
 If someone travels 57 hours late, then half the leave of that worker will go in it
 wo ghar jaakar apane parivaar ke saath rahegaa kya, milegaa kya
 We have seen the 15212 Jananayak Express that runs between Amritsar to Darbhanga
 hamaare kaam main madad kar rahe shivank ne bataaya ki 15212 number kii train 13 aktubar 2017 ko 71 ghante let thi
 Where we were eating gush on 44 hours late, here the train has set a record of running even after a delay of 71 hours
 is hafte kaa record dekhie
 The train which was supposed to reach Darbhanga at 3 am on the 3 rd arrived at 5 am on the 4th
 26 ghante let
 The 4 date train reached Darbhanga on May 5 with a delay of 33 hours
 -5 taarikh kii train 6 may ko 27 ghanta kii deree se darbhanga pahunchi
 The 6 date train reached Darbhanga on May 8 with a delay of 58 hours 35 minutes
 -7 taarikh kii train 8 may 26 ghanta 40 minute kii deree se darbhanga pahunchi
 - Two trains a day have reached Darbhanga from Amritsar
 naam se to lagata he ki jananaayak train main janata hi nayak he, magar is train main chalane vaali janata kaa haal bura he
 The specialty of this train is that it does not have AC
 sleeper nahin he
 The general is a bogey
 darbhanga stesan par hamaare sahyogi ne amritsar ke liye taiyaar ho rahi jananaayak kaa haal liya
 People are going to board the bogie at the washing pit itself
 yatriyon kaa dhiraj jawaab detaa he
 Due to the lack of seat reserve, passengers start riding to the seat from the washing pit itself
 jahaan safai hogi vahaan agar yatri chadhenge to zaahir he gaadi kii safai nahin ho paaegi
 The number of passengers is such that no one is confident that if they do not take a seat first, they will also be found
 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta ne jab yah recording kii tab us vakt bijli on nahin hui thi, magar yatriyon ke haath main pankhaa bataa rahaa he ki unhen bijli kaa kitna bharosa he
 One more thing we have noticed
 railway website kii jaankaree or railway stesan kii jaankaree main bhi kai baar antar hota he
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, it would be good if the train carrying at least workers does not run late for 57 hours
 maldaaron vaali train hi kyon samay par chale
 If people with air slippers are traveling by air, then who are traveling in the Indian Railways? aaj-kal bullate train kaa vigyaapan aane laga he

 This train was 68 hours late on 29 October 2017

 He had been sending me information for several days that due to the delay of Indian Railways he could not appear in the examination which he had been preparing for three years
 is chaatr kii teen saal kii taiyaari barbaad ho gai
 Don't know how many such students and people would have been hurt
 magar ek minute ke liye thahar kar sochie, teen saal taiyaari kii hogi or patna kota ke samay par na pahunchane ke kaaran pariksha nahin de paaya
 Ideally, the Railways should call this student and give him a job
 patna-kota express do number se chalati he
 Today, the 12237 Patna Kota Express Right Time is open
 rail mantralay ko dekhnaa chahie
 Elections are being held in Karnataka
 upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath gorakhpur se hi hai
 When we saw the condition of trains arriving at Gorakhpur station at 7
26 am, saw the list of trains arriving in the eight-hour range, there were 27 trains, of which the minimum was 23 minutes, 11055 Godan Express and maximum 29 hours 3 minutes
 Late Shaheed Express
 mukhyamantri ko agar chunavi sabhaaon main rail mantri mil jaaen to unase kah sakate hai ki gorakhpur aane jane vaali gadiyon kii haalat kharaab kyon hai
 Not only this, the train going from Gorakhpur to Yeshwantpur station in Bengaluru is running 42 hours late in the election season
 12591 gorakhpur yashavantpur express ko 5 may ko subah 6 bajkar 35 minute par ravaanaa hona tha, lekin yah 31 ghanta 35 minute let hokar 6 may ko gorakhpur se dopaher do bajkar das minute par yashavantpur ke liye ravaanaa hui
 This train has not yet reached Yeshwantpur and is running late for about 42 hours

 ise aath taarikh ko 11 bajkar 45 minute par haavda pahunchnaa tha, lekin antim baar jab check kiya tha tab yah train 15 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi
 We mentioned the Seemanchal Express in the Prime Time Rail Series, which runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar to Anand Vihar
 kisi din yah train 30 ghante deree se chalati he kisi din 25 ghante kii deree
 The effect of prime time was that, like the Freedom Fighter Express, it left Delhi on May 8 in the morning
 magar upi ke mirzapur pahunchate-pahunchate teen ghante chalis minute der ho hi gai
 On 11 March 2016, ie two years ago, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha gave a written statement in the Rajya Sabha regarding the delay

 And also told what steps were taken to fix the delay

 An analysis can also be done on the timing of trains
 do saal pehle yah sab kiya ja chukaa tha or kiya ja rahaa tha
 This is a 2016 statement
 2018 may main bhi vahi sthiti kyon he
 On May 3, PTI reported that there has been a 5 percent increase in the percentage of trains running late in the railway

 No one is talking about what they all want

 Now these employees have started to understand the new pension scheme implemented in 2004
 inhen puraani vyavastha ke tahat pension chahie
 Recently, thousands of employees had gathered in Delhi for the old pension system
 media or netaa bhale pension ke sawaal par baat na karen magar sarkari daftaron ke bheetar lakhon karmchaaree pension ke sawaal ko samajhane lage hai
 Whoever promises on their question will become their leader
 aap kisi sarkari karmchaaree se puuchhie ki use news channel par kya chahie
 Discussion of pension or lies of politicians and cunning election speeches will all say that we need old pension
 tippaniyan This picture is of Darambhaga railway station
 yahaan bhi karmchaaree puraani pension vyavastha ke liye maang kar rahe hai
 Railway union leader Shiv Gopal Mishra says that in addition to pension, two lakh vacant posts should be filled in the railway
 sarkaar ne sirf 9 xxrep 4 0 kii vaikency nikaali he magar do lakh vaikency puri honi chahie
 The rail union has started this 72-hour serial demonstration
 shivagopal mishra kaa daawa he ki saath se sattar hazaar karmchaaree 8 may ko bhukh hadtaal par baithe hai
 It is very sad that the statements of the leaders on the news channels have been encroached, taken possession
 janata kii maang kii charchaa nahin he, netaa jo tay kar rahe hai usee kii janata ke bich charchaa failaai ja rahi he
 Understand this or else ask the government employees who are yearning for a discussion in the media about the demand for pension
 bank ke karmchaariyon ko 2 pratishat selary badhaane kaa prastaav diya gaya he ve din raat chatapata rahe hai ki unki selary bahut kam he
 Someone discuss their question
 janata baichaiyn gum rahi he, news channel netaaon ke peeche gum rahe hai
 a national syllabus has been created in the country, from time to time, some topic comes up which is related to Hindu Muslim polarization

 From the name it seems that the public is the hero in the Jannayak train, but the condition of the public running in this train is bad
 is train kii khaasiyat yah ki isamen asi nahin he
 Not a sleeper
 general bogi hi he
 At Darbhanga station, our colleague took the situation of Jannayak getting ready for Amritsar
 washing pit par hi log bogi main savaar hone ke liye ja rahe hai
 The endurance of the passengers answers
 seat reserve nahin hone ke kaaran yatri washing pit se hi seat chhenkane ke liye savaar hone lagate hai
 Where there will be cleanliness, if the passengers climb, then obviously the car will not be cleaned
 yatriyon kii sankhya itani he ki kisi ko bharosa nahin he ki pehle seat nahin lee to milegi bhi
 When our colleague Pramod Gupta made this recording, electricity was not turned on at that time, but the fan in the hand of the passengers is telling them how much they trust the electricity

 There is also a difference of many times between railway website information and railway station information
 pradhanmantri khud ko kaamadaar kehete hai to kam se kam kamgaaron ko lekar chalane vaali train agar samay par chale 57 ghante let na chale to acha rahegaa
 Why did the train with goodsmen run on time? hawaii chappal vaale agar hawaii yatra kar rahe hai to bhartiya rail main koun log safar kar rahe hai
 Bullet train advertisements have started coming in every day
 lekin baaki trainon kii bullate train se kya dushmani he
 Telling the condition of Patna Kota Express
 29 aktubar 2017 ke din yah train 68 ghante let thi
 This train ruined the future of a student
 vah kai dinon se mujhe soochna bhej rahaa tha ki bhartiya rail kii deree ke kaaran vah us pariksha main shaamil nahin ho sakaa jisaki taiyaari vah teen saal se kar rahaa tha
 This student's three-year preparation was ruined
 na jane aise kitne chaatro or logon kaa nuksaan hua hoga
 But think for a minute, three years will have to be prepared and Patna could not take the exam due to not reaching the quota time
 kaayade se railway ko is chaatr ko bulaakar apane yahaan naukari de deni chahie
 patna-kota Express runs from number two
 aaj 12237 number kii patna kota express rhite time khuli he
 Ministry of Railways is a must see

 or yah bhi bataaya tha ki deree ko thik karne ke liye kya kya kadam uthaae gaye the
 He had said that the staff associated with the train operation is being encouraged
 time teble main sudhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Efficiency is being improved through new structures
 railway ne nayaa iti system icmc lagaaya he
 Through this, online monitoring of trains can be done
 trainon ke samay ko lekar vishleshan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 All this was done and was being done two years ago

 Why is the same situation in May 2018

 Do you want a pension, ask yourself the answer to this question

 Ticket cutters, drivers that we call loco pilots, assistant loco pilots, electrical mechanical workers, guards, and staff at the trackman office are also involved in the demonstration

 The media and politicians may not talk about the question of pension, but lakhs of employees within government offices are beginning to understand the question of pension
 jo inke sawaal par vaada karegaa wo inkaa netaa ho jayega
 Ask any government employee what he needs on the news channel
 pension par charchaa yaa netaaon ke jhooth or chaalaaki se bhare chunavi bhaashan to sab kahenge ki hamen puraani pension chahie
 The comments yah tasviir darambhaga railway stesan kii he
 Here too the employees are demanding for the old pension system
 rail union ke netaa shiv gopal mishra kaa kahana he ki pension ke alaava railway main do lakh khaali padon ko bharaa janaa chahie
 The government has removed only the vacancy of 9 xxrep 4 0 but two lakh vacancy should be fulfilled

 Shivgopal Mishra claims that sixty to seventy thousand workers are on hunger strike on 8 May
 yah bahut dukhad he ki news channelon par netaaon ke bayanon kaa atikaraman ho gaya he, kabza ho gaya
 There is no discussion of the demand of the public, what is being decided by the leaders is being discussed among the people
 aap ise samajhie varanaa pension kii maang ko lekar media main charchaa ke liye taras rahe sarkari karmchaariyon se puch kar dekhie
 The employees of the bank have been proposed to increase their salary by 2 percent
 They are splurging day and night that their salary is very less

 Whoever promises on their question will become their leader

 Discussion of pension or lies of politicians and cunning election speeches will all say that we need old pension

 janata kii maang kii charchaa nahin he, netaa jo tay kar rahe hai usee kii janata ke bich charchaa failaai ja rahi he
 Understand this or else ask the government employees who are yearning for a discussion in the media about the demand for pension

 Due to the lack of seat reserve, passengers start riding to the seat from the washing pit itself
 jahaan safai hogi vahaan agar yatri chadhenge to zaahir he gaadi kii safai nahin ho paaegi
 The number of passengers is such that no one is confident that if they do not take a seat first, they will also be found

 He had been sending me information for several days that due to the delay of Indian Railways he could not appear in the examination which he had been preparing for three years
 is chaatr kii teen saal kii taiyaari barbaad ho gai
 Don't know how many such students and people would have been hurt
 magar ek minute ke liye thahar kar sochie, teen saal taiyaari kii hogi or patna kota ke samay par na pahunchane ke kaaran pariksha nahin de paaya
 Ideally, the Railways should call this student and give him a job
 patna-kota express do number se chalati he
 Today, the 12237 Patna Kota Express Right Time is open

 Elections are being held in Karnataka
 upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath gorakhpur se hi hai
 When we saw the condition of trains arriving at Gorakhpur station at 7
26 am, saw the list of trains arriving in the eight-hour range, there were 27 trains, of which the minimum was 23 minutes, 11055 Godan Express and maximum 29 hours 3 minutes
 Late Shaheed Express
 mukhyamantri ko agar chunavi sabhaaon main rail mantri mil jaaen to unase kah sakate hai ki gorakhpur aane jane vaali gadiyon kii haalat kharaab kyon hai

 We mentioned the Seemanchal Express in the Prime Time Rail Series, which runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar to Anand Vihar
 kisi din yah train 30 ghante deree se chalati he kisi din 25 ghante kii deree
 The effect of prime time was that, like the Freedom Fighter Express, it left Delhi on May 8 in the morning
 magar upi ke mirzapur pahunchate-pahunchate teen ghante chalis minute der ho hi gai
 On 11 March 2016, ie two years ago, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha gave a written statement in the Rajya Sabha regarding the delay

 And also told what steps were taken to fix the delay
 unhone kaha tha ki train oparation se jude staff ko protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 The time table is being improved

 An analysis can also be done on the timing of trains

 This is a 2016 statement
 2018 may main bhi vahi sthiti kyon he

 12322 Kolkata Mail which runs between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminal to Kolkata, this train was to run from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminal at 9:30 AM on 6th, but it departed late by 9 hours 53 minutes
 ise aath taarikh ko 11 bajkar 45 minute par haavda pahunchnaa tha, lekin antim baar jab check kiya tha tab yah train 15 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi
 We mentioned the Seemanchal Express in the Prime Time Rail Series, which runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar to Anand Vihar
 kisi din yah train 30 ghante deree se chalati he kisi din 25 ghante kii deree
 The effect of prime time was that, like the Freedom Fighter Express, it left Delhi on May 8 in the morning
 magar upi ke mirzapur pahunchate-pahunchate teen ghante chalis minute der ho hi gai
 On 11 March 2016, ie two years ago, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha gave a written statement in the Rajya Sabha regarding the delay
 is bayaan main unhone deree ke kai kaaran bataaye the
 And also told what steps were taken to fix the delay
 unhone kaha tha ki train oparation se jude staff ko protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 The time table is being improved
 nae dhaanchon ke zarie kshamta main sudhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Railways has installed new IT system icmc
 iske zarie trainon ke samay kii online manitering kii ja sakati he
 An analysis can also be done on the timing of trains
 do saal pehle yah sab kiya ja chukaa tha or kiya ja rahaa tha
 This is a 2016 statement
 2018 may main bhi vahi sthiti kyon he
 On May 3, PTI reported that there has been a 5 percent increase in the percentage of trains running late in the railway
 susheel mahapatra ne jansampark adhikari rajesh vaajapeyi se baatcheet kii he
 You are showing some part of it
 kya aapako pension chahie, is sawaal kaa jawaab khud se puuchhie
 Railway employees have descended on the conflict over this question
 8 may ko desh ke kai railway stesan par rail karmchaariyon main pradarshan kiya he
 Rail union members are sitting on a dharna at Nizamuddin railway station
 tikat kaatane vaale, dryver jise ham loko payalat kehete hai, asistent loko payalat kehete hai, electrical mecanical karmchaaree, guard, trecoman daftar main bhi kaam karne vaale karmchaaree is pradarshan main shaamil hai
 No one is talking about what they all want
 inhen pension kii puraani vyavastha chahie
 Now these employees have started to understand the new pension scheme implemented in 2004
 inhen puraani vyavastha ke tahat pension chahie
 Recently, thousands of employees had gathered in Delhi for the old pension system
 media or netaa bhale pension ke sawaal par baat na karen magar sarkari daftaron ke bheetar lakhon karmchaaree pension ke sawaal ko samajhane lage hai
 Whoever promises on their question will become their leader
 aap kisi sarkari karmchaaree se puuchhie ki use news channel par kya chahie
 Discussion of pension or lies of politicians and cunning election speeches will all say that we need old pension
 tippaniyan This picture is of Darambhaga railway station
 yahaan bhi karmchaaree puraani pension vyavastha ke liye maang kar rahe hai
 Railway union leader Shiv Gopal Mishra says that in addition to pension, two lakh vacant posts should be filled in the railway
 sarkaar ne sirf 9 xxrep 4 0 kii vaikency nikaali he magar do lakh vaikency puri honi chahie
 The rail union has started this 72-hour serial demonstration
 shivagopal mishra kaa daawa he ki saath se sattar hazaar karmchaaree 8 may ko bhukh hadtaal par baithe hai
 It is very sad that the statements of the leaders on the news channels have been encroached, taken possession
 janata kii maang kii charchaa nahin he, netaa jo tay kar rahe hai usee kii janata ke bich charchaa failaai ja rahi he
 Understand this or else ask the government employees who are yearning for a discussion in the media about the demand for pension
 bank ke karmchaariyon ko 2 pratishat selary badhaane kaa prastaav diya gaya he ve din raat chatapata rahe hai ki unki selary bahut kam he
 Someone discuss their question
 janata baichaiyn gum rahi he, news channel netaaon ke peeche gum rahe hai
 a national syllabus has been created in the country, from time to time, some topic comes up which is related to Hindu Muslim polarization
 nafrat se hota he
 The rest you yourself are sensible

 rail union ne 72 ghante kaa yah kramik pradarshan shuru kiya he
 Shivgopal Mishra claims that sixty to seventy thousand workers are on hunger strike on 8 May
 yah bahut dukhad he ki news channelon par netaaon ke bayanon kaa atikaraman ho gaya he, kabza ho gaya
 There is no discussion of the demand of the public, what is being decided by the leaders is being discussed among the people
 aap ise samajhie varanaa pension kii maang ko lekar media main charchaa ke liye taras rahe sarkari karmchaariyon se puch kar dekhie
 The employees of the bank have been proposed to increase their salary by 2 percent
 They are splurging day and night that their salary is very less

 This picture is of Darambhaga railway station

 Railway union leader Shiv Gopal Mishra says that in addition to pension, two lakh vacant posts should be filled in the railway
 sarkaar ne sirf 9 xxrep 4 0 kii vaikency nikaali he magar do lakh vaikency puri honi chahie
 The rail union has started this 72-hour serial demonstration
 shivagopal mishra kaa daawa he ki saath se sattar hazaar karmchaaree 8 may ko bhukh hadtaal par baithe hai
 It is very sad that the statements of the leaders on the news channels have been encroached, taken possession
 janata kii maang kii charchaa nahin he, netaa jo tay kar rahe hai usee kii janata ke bich charchaa failaai ja rahi he
 Understand this or else ask the government employees who are yearning for a discussion in the media about the demand for pension
 bank ke karmchaariyon ko 2 pratishat selary badhaane kaa prastaav diya gaya he ve din raat chatapata rahe hai ki unki selary bahut kam he
 Someone discuss their question
 janata baichaiyn gum rahi he, news channel netaaon ke peeche gum rahe hai
 a national syllabus has been created in the country, from time to time, some topic comes up which is related to Hindu Muslim polarization
 nafrat se hota he
 The rest you yourself are sensible

 iraq main agava 39 bhartiya jinda hai yaa nahin, sarkaar ko is bare main koi pukhta jaankaree nahin he

 suhaag ne ye aarope purv sena pramukh or maujuuda vakt main kendriya rajya mantri wike singh par lagaaya he
 Suhag said this in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court
 ye halafanama us yachika ke jawaab main daakhil kiya gaya he jisamen suhaag ke sena pramukh banane ko chunauti di gai he
 The petition is that of former lieutenant generals gloves
 ab sevanivrutt ho chuke leftinent general ravi dastaane ne 2014 main suhaag ke khilaaf yachika daayar kii thi
 The petition said that in May 2012, Suhag was subjected to a disciplinary stay

 But on 1 June 2012, Vikram Singh, who became the army chief, lifted this ban in favor
 iske baad suhaag ko purvi bharat kaa army commander bana diya gaya
 Promotion-made Army Chief Ravi Glove had alleged that due to this promotion, Dalbir Suhag had become a contender for becoming the Chief of Army Staff in future
 chunki, unka 2012 main hua pramotion galat tha, isliye unhen sena pramukh na banane diya jaae
 However, the Supreme Court then refused to give any such order
 tab se ye yachika lambit he
 The disciplinary ban on Suhag was imposed as the army chief of General VK Singh

 Despite this, he was suddenly subjected to a disciplinary ban

 This conspiracy was hatched by the then army chief VK Singh
 unke baad sena pramukh bane general vikram singh ne is karrwai ko galat maanate hue nirast kar diya
 Earlier in the affidavit filed in June 2014, the Ministry of Defense also termed the action taken in May 2012 against Suhag as 'conspiracy'
 suhaag par roak sahihaalanki, ab kendriya mantri ban chuke wike singh kai maukon par ye kah chuke hai ki agar sena kii koi tukdi dakaiti jaisaa aparaadh kare to uske pramukh par anushaasanamak karrwai honi hi chahie
 Therefore, he did it right by banning Suhag

 haalanki congress kii ore se aae is bayaan ko tiemasi netaa mamata banerjee, sapa netaa akhilesh yadav ne zyada tavajjo nahin di thi
 But after 20 big leaders joined Mamta Banerjee's Maharali held in Kolkata on Saturday, it seems that the Congress is now thinking it is appropriate to go backfoot on the question of candidature for the post of PM
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad piel puniya ne kaha he ki jahaan tak piem pad kaa sawaal he, is par faisla chunaav ke baad hoga, loktantric tareeke kaa paalan kiya jayega, har koi piem pad ke liye yogya he

 Mamata Banerjee, who is strongly advocating for the Third Front, has not missed out on presenting herself as a leader from time to time
 beete saal hi niti ayog kii baithak se itar unhone andhra pradesh ko special darja ke mudde par andhra pradesh ke siem chandra babu naidu ke saath piem modi se bhi mulaakaat kii

 siyaasi rup se ye paanchon rajya aise hai jiske nattejey sanket dene ke liye kaaphi honge ki congress bina sahyogiyon kii baisakhi ke mukaable main thathne laayak he yaa nahin
 Whether or not its partner is in a position to make a dent in the influence and dominance of the regional parties and how far the BJP has reached the position of increasing its dominance in the northeast
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan main bhaajapa or congress kaa sidhaa muqabla he
 The BJP has been in power in Madhya Pradesh for the last 15 years
 in varshon main ekatra hue satta virdohi rujhaan ke bich kya congress janata kaa bharosa jeetne laayak hui he is sawaal kaa uttar 11 disambar ko chunaav nateezon se mil jaaenge
 If the Congress has not managed to capitalize on the 15-year anti-incumbency trend, then it will be difficult to believe that the Congress will achieve anything big in 2019 due to the five-year anti-incumbency trends of the central government
 yadi congress rajasthan main apana paracham laharaa saki to vah seenaa thonk kar kah sakati he ki jahaan bhaajapa kaa sidhaa muqabla congress se he vahaan janata congress ko bhaajapa kaa vikalp sweekaar kar rahi he
 This may boost the morale of the Congress cadre in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 chhattisgarh main basapa or ajit jogi ke saath mil kar chunaav ladane ke faisle se muqabla trikoniya hoga
 If the Congress succeeds in getting the election results in its favor, then the party will be able to convey the message that it has the merit of becoming the pivot for the anti-bjp parties in the 2019 elections
 aisa nahin hone par yah sandesh jayega ki 2019 main bina mahagathbandhan ke congress, bhaajapa se muqabla karne main shaayad na ho

 Here TDP has tied up with Congress and Left party
 tiares virdohi khemaa yah aarope laga rahaa he ki tiares 2019 ke chunaav ke dauraan yaa chunaav baad bhaajapa ke paale main jaaegi
 Even after these accusations, if the TRS wins, then the discussion of this can start when the politics of both BJP and TRS are in favor of each other
 yadi yahaan tiares haar jaati he to phir upie ke partneron kii sankhya badhane ke raste aasaan ho jaaenge
 If the BJP succeeds in Mizoram, then for 2019, the bjp's claim that the party will win all 25 seats in the north-east states in the Lok Sabha elections will bolster that claim
 lekin yadi bhaajapa ko yahaan safalataa nahin milti he to phir bhaajapa virdohi dalon ke liye yah kehane kaa mauka hoga ki uttar-purv main bhaajapa kaa paraabhav hona shuru ho gaya he

 Addressing the rally on the 22nd day of Janchetna Yatra, the BJP leader said, "just as clean administration and corruption cannot run together, democracy and dynasty cannot live together
 ’ unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress ek parivaar kii party rah gayi he
 He said that not just one but his son, then his son will continue like this
 unhone khed jataayaa ki swatantraaa ke 60 varsh baad bhi bharat ab bhi duniya ke pichde deshon main he or ise agrani desh nahin mana jaataa
 Advani said that this is because people in power for a long time could not give clean administration in the country
 unhone kaha, ‘1947 main hamen swaraj mila lekin jin logon ne raaj kiya ve ise suraaj main nahin badal sake or svachh evam acha prashasan muhaiyaa karaane main vifal rahe
 'advani said,' The first few years were fine, when we had leaders like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who kept the country united
 lekin iske baad sthiti kharaab hone lagi
 The Congress gradually transformed into a family party
 ’adwani ne kaha ki centre main congress nit ‘bhrasht’ sarkaar ke kaaran bharat kii chhavi kharaab ho rahi he or vishwa ke anya deshon main isaki garima kam ho rahi he
 He said that if India's black money comes back, India will become a prosperous and leading nation
 unhone yah bhi ummid jataai ki waapas laayaa gaya kaala dhan gramin bharat main kharch kiya jaae to desh bhar ke chah lakh gaanv samruddhi kii ore agrasar ho jaaenge
