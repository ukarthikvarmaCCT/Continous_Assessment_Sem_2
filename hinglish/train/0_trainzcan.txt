 Aarushi's parents Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar, who were convicted in the CBI court, were acquitted by the Allahabad High Court for lack of evidence

 But the question is still alive about who killed Aarushi and Hemraj

 Meanwhile, a new thing has emerged that the CBI had not conducted an investigation of the crime scene simply because it was too expensive
 sibiai kaa tarktha ki uski team kaatil ko khoj nikaalane ke liye krime seen se sabhi paristhitijanya or 'vaigyanik' saboot ikattha kar chuki thi
 Because of which he did not get the 'touch-dna' test done because it is too expensive

 It is reported that between 2011 and 2016, India's economy has suffered many serious setbacks
 niryaat dhwast ho gaya, bank ghate main aa gaye, corporate kaa ativistaar, sookhaa or notebandi
 Even after this, GDP 7

 Only came in at 9 percent

 His questions have been published in detail in some English newspapers
 unka kahana he ki upie 2 ke aakhri varshon main kaha jaataa tha ki nitiyon ko lakva maar gaya he
 But in the same period productivity has also increased
 sambhav to yahi he ki is dauraan utpaadakta bhi kaaphi ghat gai hogi or agar utpaadakta badi thi to phir use companiyon ke munaafe main jhalakana tha jo ki nahin hua
 Rishi Ranjan Kala of Financial Express reports
 2017-18 main electranik mantralay ne kaha tha ki 120 companiyaan hai jo mobile phone or unke purje banaati hai
 When the National Policy on Electronic was formulated in February 2019, it was said that the number of companies making mobile handsets and parts has increased to 268
 yah sara kuch pichley 3-4 saal main hua he
 In December 2018, the Prime Minister says 120 companies are making mobiles
 1 farvari 2019 ke antarim bajet main vitt mantri ne isaki sankhya 268 bataai
 When Financial Express investigated, it was found that there are 127 units in India that make mobile phones
 inamen se maatr 41 pratishat oparational hai yani chaalu haalat main hai
 Of the 65 units, 55 percent make batteries only
 85 companiyaan charger banaati hai
 When the reporter asked the ministry how many companies or units were producing mobile phones, the reply was not received
 samvaadadaataaon ke zyaadaatar sawaalon ke jawaab yahi hote hai
 Not only this, these companies have to register with the Bureau of Standards, they also do not have the figures
 neshnal policy on electranik 2019 ke anusaar bharat main handset kaa utpaadan 2014-15 main 6 karod se badhkar 2017-18 main 22
 5 crores
 isamen pratyaksh or apratyaksh rup se 6
 7 lakh people got work
 2015 main puri tarah se taiyaar mobile phone ke saamaanon kaa aayaat 8 arab dollar kaa hua tha
 3 in 2018
 5 arab dollar kaa rah gaya
 That means much has happened
 duusari taraf mobile phone ke saamaan kaa aayaat 2
 11 increased from $ 8 billion
 6 arab dollar ho gaya
 This year it has decreased a little
 hindustan times main bhi pichley saal aisi report chhapi thi
 Which we wrote about on the Facebook page
 financial express ke patrkaar rishi ranjan kaala kehete hai ki artiai ke jawaab main bataaya gaya ki 342 unit hai
 There may be some overlap, so the ministry cites the number of units as 268
 jaise 15 aise unit hai jinhone apana panjikaran mobile phone or bydaree pack banane ke liye karaayaa he
 If the same company is doing two things then one must be counted
 kaala sahab likhte hai ki inhen 1 gina janaa chahie
 There is no account on the BIS website of how many mobile phones are produced
 lekin iskaa hisaab he ki kitne unit chaalu hai or kitne band ho chuke hai
 Apart from this, Rishi Ranjan Kala has also checked with the data of the Registrar of Companies
 ek company he rising stars mobile india privet limited jo mobile phone banaati he
 The BIS site states that the company has a unit in Maharashtra whose registration has been lapse
 andhra pradesh main bhi do unit hai
 Where many companies' phones are made
 aankadon ko lekar jhansebaaji kaamyaab hoti rahegi

 Behind the scenes
 
 Rehabilitating and re conditioning my body has taken almost 10 months now
 And I'm still in the process
 
 Torn right ankle ligaments and a sprained left plus a thorasic slip disc
 As if one wasn’t enough
 
 My coordination was incredibly messed up
 I'd say jump and my body wouldn't listen
 Couldn’t load the feet or my spine
 Needless to say i was losing muscle mass and gaining unwanted weight by the day
 Couldn’t do any cardio or weights
 Only thing i could control so as to not fall off the grid completely was my diet
 Not eating the stuff i liked frustrated me further
 
 I’v been sharing a few clips here from that journey
 zmr's with light weights, band work plus whole lot of other techniques i discovered
 The most important being writing down each day’s progress
 I'd aim to do 1 more than yesterday
 
 i hope it helps those who are currently in pain or injured
 My rehab and conditioning has been frustratingly slow, after 3 months of a lot of effort and very little results, i was plagued with self doubt and a part of me wanted to quit
 
 But there is magic in consistency
 
 Trust it
 And keep going
 
 All the best!

 Significantly, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj made a statement about the unrest in Pakistan in the United Nations
 sushamaa ne pakistan par shakti prahaar karte hue kaha ki pakistan kii pahchaan aatankwaadi desh ke rup main he
 Taking a dig at Pakistan, Sushma said that Pakistan and India were free together, but we have set up institutions like AIIMS, iits, iims in the country, while Pakistan has formed terrorist organizations like Lashkar, Jaish
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki begunaahon kaa khun bahaane vaala pakistan hamen maanavadhikaar kaa paath padhaa rahaa he
 Signs of evil started emerging long before the terrorists hijacked the merchant boat 'kubera' from the Gujarat coast to Mumbai
 yah baat alag he ki sarkaar or suraksha balon ne ise samajhane se inkaar kar diya
 In the last four years, the Gujarat government had sent several memorandum to the central government about a comprehensive security plan for its 1,600 km long coastline, but each time the Ministry of Home Affairs rejected it
 antim naamanzoori mumbai par aatankwaadi hamale se sirf paanch din pehle 21 november ko di gai thi
 Gujarat's Minister of State for Home Amit Shah says, "we tried to understand the central government that half-baked plans will not work because we are not too far from the Pakistan border
" lekin centre kii suraksha kii avadharana main bahut khamiyaan thim
 "last year, on the issue of internal security, this matter was raised by Narendra Modi in the conference of Chief Ministers but his effort was also like hitting the walls
 yah prastaav sabase pehle 2003 main laayaa gaya tha, jab bhaajapa ke netritv vaali rajg sarkaar centre main thi
 371 crores Rs
 kii prastaavit panchavarshiya yojana main rajya ke samudr tat ke saath-saath 51 thanon, 70 chaukiyon, 90 nigaraanee toweron, drutagati se chalane vaali 32 naavon, teen interceptor naavon kii vyavastha karnaa or tatavarti gaanvon ke machuaaron ko pahchaan patr jari karnaa shaamil tha
 The government also proposed to set up a fishermen watchdog group to monitor the movements of fishermen (see box)
 paanch saal baad rajya sarkaar ko ab bhi in prastaavon kii manjuuri kaa intjaar he
 Meanwhile, 37 years after the attack on Karachi by its warships, the Indian Navy is not celebrating its Navy Day, as the country mourns the loss of the first attack by sea route
 vaise, aatankwaadiyon ne desh par samudr kii ore se pehali baar hamalaa nahin bolaa he
 In 1993, RDX was brought from Pakistan on boats, which was used to carry out attacks at 13 places in Mumbai
 tab aatankwaadi hamalon main 257 logon kii jaan gai thi
 In its coastal security plan in January 2005, the central government has sanctioned Rs
 742 crore for setting up special police stations equipped with special high-speed boats and duty personnel in eight states and four union territories
 kii sweekruti di thi
 It covers 7,600 km of Indian coastline
 in rajyon main se teen-tamilnadu, orissa or kerala- ne abhi is yojana ko lagu nahin kiya he, jabaki maharashtra main yah yojana abhi shuru hi hui he
 The sealing of borders has made it easier for terrorists to enter by sea
 pichley do varshon main khufia agenciyon ne chetavanee de di thi ki pakistani nausena or iesai prashikshit aatankwaadi machuaaron ke rup main tatavarti kshetra se ghuspaith kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 "for the last two years, we have been demanding from the government a system like the Vessel Traffic Management System (or VTMS), under which all dangerous boats can be reconnaissance," says a senior Navy official
 hamane sabhi machuaaron ko electronic card jari karne kii bhi maang kii thi
 The Western Coast Coast Guard (coast Guard), engaged in monitoring the sensitive coastline of about 3,300 km between Gujarat and Kerala, has a fleet of 14 ships of various sizes and eight surveillance airplanes, while in reality it is under-served
 - Less than 50 ships and 36 airplanes are needed
 na to coast guard ko or na hi nausena ko vyapaaree jahaajon ko rokane yaa unki talaashi lene kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 This privilege rests with the Director General of Shipping, a bureaucrat appointed on the coast, and has neither staff nor ship
 america main 9 / 11 ko world trade centre kii do gaganchumbi imaaraton par bheeshan aatankwaadi hamale ke baad america sarkaar ne custom or coast guard sahit 22 agenciyon ko department of homeland security (dchaes) ke jhande tale laa diya tha
 The responsibility of protecting the beaches in India has been left to the Navy and the Coast Guard working under the Ministry of Defense, thus the determination of beach safety policies is lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the bureaucracy
 aath tatavarti rajyon or chaar centre shasit kshetron ke alaava centre sarkaar ke 12 mantralay or aath vibhaag samudr tatavarti niti nirdhaaran or kriyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar hai
 The result is that the responsibilities are divided in many places and there are problems in taking immediate decisions and actions
 chunki samudr tat kii suraksha vyavastha pukhta karnaa ek dhimi prakriya he, iske liye karmchaariyon kii niyukti or manch (paryaapt suvidhaayen) muhaiyaa karaane main kuch varsh lag jate hai
 Therefore, it is very important to identify in advance the possible targets on which terrorists can easily reach through the sea to attack
 coast guard ke purv mahanideshak vaais admiral arun kumaar singh kehete hai, ''imasen shaq nahin ki mumbai hameshaa hi hamale kaa sahaj nishaanaa rahegi or ise adhiktam suraksha kii jarurat he; iske alaava goa, port blair or chennai jaise paryaton sthal bhi america, british or israeli paryatakon main kaaphi lokapriy hai
 Strict security arrangements should also be made immediately
 ''lekin gujarat sarkaar ko sabase zyada chintaa kuccha se lekar valsad tak ke kshetra main bane audyogic pratishthanon kii suraksha kii he
 The strip can boast of building some of the largest industrial establishments in India
 inamen jamnagar tat par reliance or essar ke kaccha tel shodhak sanyantr; kandla, adani or peepivav jaisi bandargahen, surat ke nikat hajira main reliance or duusari companiyon ke petrochemical sanyantr or bhadchch ke nikat dahej bandargah par sthapit nae udyog shaamil hai
 Senior state police officials say that terrorists armed with easy-to-access explosives in Mumbai can target these industrial installations as easily, especially at crude oil and petrochemical complexes
 hajira bharat kaa bada petrochemical centre he, jahaan bharat kii lagbhag 50 fisadi gas kaa parishodhan kiya jaataa he or jieiel kii hajira-bijapur-jagadishpur pipeline yaheen se shuru hoti he
 Considering the flammability of these industrial units, it can be said that only half of the explosives and explosives used by the terrorists in the Mumbai attack is enough to destroy Hazira
 dakshin gujarat chembar of commers and industry ke adhyaksh chetan shah kehete hai, ''hajira, jamnagar or dahej jaise kshetron ko hawaii or nausena suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaani chahie kyonki inamen se ek bhi centre par aatankwaadi hamalaa bharat ko hi pangu kar saktaa he
 "it has long been feared that fishermen caught by the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency while fishing in the saurashtra-kutch sea area may fall prey to the tactics of Pakistani spies
" haalanki isaki pushti ke abhi pramaan nahin mil paae hai
 So far only one fisherman returned from there has been able to come under the scrutiny of Indian security agencies
 kuccha main ek varisht khufia adhikari kaa kahana he, ''saikadon machuaare pakistani jelon main hai
 And some must have come in their trap
 hamaare paas unki talaashi kaa koi jariya nahin he
 "the Prime Minister while addressing the nation had said," We will force them to pay its heavy price
 '' kuch isi aashay ke unke shabd the
 His words could be believed if his government and officials had taken the right steps on time
 lekin yadi yah sarkaar isi tarah hill-huzzat karti rahi or karrwai karne main sust rahi-jaisaaki gujarat ke maamle main hua- to aatankwaadiyon ko phir hamalaa karne main der nahin lagegi
 Is anyone listening? The central government has always rejected the request for coastal security
 - 4 april, 2003 ko gujarat sarkaar ne 1,600 kimi lambey samudr tat kii suraksha ke liye 371 karod ru
 The draft of the Five Year Plan was sent to the Central Government
 - 2004 main upie centre main satta main aata he, or vah gujarat sarkaar se sanshodhit suraksha yojana kii maang karata he
 In response, the Government of Gujarat on May 30, 2005, Rs
 321 crore
 kii sanshodhit yojana kaa praaroop bhejti he
 58 crores in the UPA Government Scheme, cut down
 kii yojana ko manjuuri detii he, jiske tahat 10 thane gathit karne kaa praavdhaan he
 The Gujarat government has already implemented it
 - yah maan kar ki 58 karod ru
 Not enough for coastal security, the Government of Gujarat Rs 219 crore
 kii ek anya yojana centre sarkaar kii manjuuri ke liye bhejti he, jise centre sarkaar naamanzoor kar detii he
 - On July 5, 2007, the Gujarat government sends another letter to the central government requesting it to reconsider its decision
 use jawaab miltaa he ki yojana ko manjuuri nahin di ja rahi or is par 2010 main hi vichaar kiya jayega
 - In April 2008, LK Advani meets the Prime Minister, and requests to reconsider the Gujarat government's plan
 - 17 july ko phir gujarat sarkaar centre se 2010 tak intjaar karne kii jagah ab hi yojana par vichaar karne ko kahati he
 - On November 21, the Center again rejects this proposal saying that it can be considered only in 2010

 Researchers active in the city of Perth have detected tiny gold particles hidden in Eucalyptus trees
 yah ek aisi khoj he jo bhavishya main is keemtee dhaatu ke bhandar khojane main madadgaar ho sakati he
 How gold came in trees According to the news of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, researchers at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said that they believe that trees that grow above the gold-rich land have deep roots
 sookhe ke dauraan ye jaden nami kii talash main gaharaai main chhipe sone ko chus leti hai
 CSIRO geochemist Melvan Linturn said, 'we were not expecting this
 pattiyon main sone ke kan milanaa hamaare liye vaaki ek adbhut avasar tha
 He said, "the trees we researched had taken this gold from a depth of about 30 meters
 yah gaharaai kisi das manjila imaarat kii unchai ke baraabar hogi
 This gold mine has been found in this forest in Calgurli, a resource-rich area of western Australia
 19veen sadi ke antim varshon main main yah sthaan sone kaa ek bhandar sthal rahaa he

 This tree acts as a pump
 "eucalyptus acts like a hydraulic pump
" isaki jaden jameen ke bheetar dasiyon meter tak faili hoti hai or yah jalayukt swarna ko apni ore khinchataa he
 "since gold can be poisonous to the plant, it goes towards the leaves and branches from where it can fall
" ’ haalanki lintern yah bhi kehete hai ki yadi swarna bhandar ke upar 500 ped bhi uga liye jaaen to bhi unase sirf shaadi kii ek anguthi laayak sona hi praapt hoga
 But scientists can use a technique called 'biogeochemical sampling' to detect gold present below the surface
 lintern ne kaha,‘khanijon kaa pataa lagane ke liye vanaspati kii sampling or phir unka vishleshan karke bina khudaai ke hi yah pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sataha ke neeche chal kya rahaa he
 This is a more focused method of mineral exploration, which also costs less and has less impact on the environment, 'he said, adding that this method can also be used to detect other metals such as zinc and copper

 jaise manthara daasi se rani nahin ho sakati thi chaahe jo raja ho jaae isliye koun raja hota he or koun nahin isaki use kya phikar hoti? lekin loktantr main mantharawaala ravaiya rakhana to ekadam galat he
 After all Phoolan Devi is now an MP from Mirzapur and his Jat farmer leader Tikait of Meerut area says why not make him the Prime Minister

 This time no two candidates, Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have contested the election in the hope of becoming the Prime Minister
 akeli congress main hi unki ginati darjan se upar jaaegi
 Sharad Pawar, Rajesh Pilot fought from Karunakaran and Jakhar to Kamal Nath hoping for the ultimate position in the heart

 Both consider themselves serious contenders for the highest position
 congress se nikle arjunasingh desh ke bhavi pradhanmantri hai aisa to postaron main bhi chapa tha
 He is a candidate for five years in this post and even if he has lost to Satna, the flame of the supreme post is always in his left heart
 aakhir bai pasavaale narsingh raav ke dil main pehle bhale na lagi ho lekin pradhanmantri hone ke baad se to lagi hui he hi
 Arjun Singh's heart is still stronger than Narasimha Rao
 arjuna singh kii party ke adhyaksh narayan dutt tiwari kehete or chhipate nahin phirte lekin paroksh unka aarope yahi tha ki narsingh raav unhen apana pratidwandvi maanate the isliye congress main unka rahanaa dubhar kar diya or aakhir unhen arjuna singh ke saath hona padaa
 Madhavrao Scindia, the most vehement claim by Narasimha Rao to be expelled from the Congress for being considered his rival, was campaigned in Gwalior
 ve apni chunaav sabhaaon main sindhiyaaon kii gauravshaalee raaj parampara kaa varnan karte or kehete ki ve to gwalior kaa vikaas karne ke liye kendra main mantri bhar the lekin raav saab ko laga ki yah pradhanmantri ho jayega
 So they took them out
 ve is dharna ko apni bhootpurv praja ke man main jamaane main lage rahe ki party duniya ke media kaa dhyaan gwalior par kyon laga he kyonki yahaan se nayaa pradhanmantri nikalanevaala he jo rajeev gandhi kii tarj par bharat ko ikkisvin sadi main le jayega
 Rajiv Gandhi belonged to the dynasty and is also Madhavrao
 rajeev san chavalis main janme the or sindhiya maharaj unase ek saal baad
 He does not know himself personally, but one thing has also been going on in the political chandelier of Delhi that Madhavrao Scindia considers himself the consensus prime ministerial candidate of a non-bjp gathering
 gwalior main to chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan aamtaur par yah baat kahi jaati thi
 And then the karmis of Andhra like Narasimha Rao can be the Prime Minister, so why can not Shrimant Maharaj of Sindhia dynasty
 agar sindhiya main pradhanmantri hone kii yogyata or sambhaavna nahin hoti to narsingh raav unase itnaa kyon darate? kyon unhen shadyantr karke hawala main fansaate? bhala sindhiya vansh ke maharaj ko hawaale ke paise kii koi jarurat ho sakati he?karnataka se devgauda kaa naam pradhanmantri pad ke liye nahin chalaa
 But Ramakrishna Hegde stands as a possibility for some decade
 is baar bhi unka naam joro se chalaa hi tha
 That should be bad, the people of the people who have stopped talking in the middle
 vaise hegade kaa naam bhale hi utar gaya ho par devgauda kaa naam to chadh hi gaya he or koun jaanata he ki june ke pehle saptaah main ve shapath le hi len
 Nandamuri Tarak Ramrao had no objection to another great leader occupying the ultimate position

 When Sonia Gandhi became Congress President for the second time in the late evening of August 11 this year, she asked an old Congress leader, who is not really considered close to her, "are you ready for the battle ahead?" It is going to be a long battle
 '' yah sawaal sanket tha ki unhone bete rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad apni duusari pari ke liye kya yojanaayen banaai hai
 His first term lasted for two decades and the Congress ruled the center for ten years
 apane bharosemand sipahasaalar ahamed patel ke saath, sonia ne ek baar phir se party main jaan foonkane kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 The party has been wiped out in most parts of the country, so it will be a big task
 abhi congress sirf paanch rajyon main satta main he or unamem se do—rajasthan or madhya pradesh—main maamuli bahumat par chal rahi he
 Following humiliating defeats in two consecutive general elections, mutual quarrels and discontent are flourishing in almost all state units
 23 may ke nateezon ke baad se kai prabhaavshaalee netaaon ne congress chhod di he or kai anya saarvajanik rup se party ke khilaaf bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 The most bickering is seen in Maharashtra and Haryana where assembly elections are in the final stages
 congress ke bheetar teen alag-alag timen ubhar ai hai, jo kai baar party line se vipareet uddeshyon par kaam karte hai or isse party ke dirghakaalik astitv ko lekar andeshaa hota he
 The first team has leaders who worked closely with Sonia in her first term
 duusari team un logon kii he jo gaiyr-rajnatik prishthbhumi vaale peshewar hai or jinhone rahul gandhi ke karyaalay main kaam kiya he
 The third team is of other prominent leaders who are either not in either group or who have lost the trust of the Gandhi family
 or is team kii sankhya bad rahi he
 Ever since Sonia returned to hand, the impression and influence of her old team can be clearly seen in every decision of the party
 udhaaharan ke liye, maharashtra main jahaan 21 aktubar ko chunaav hone hai, apekshaakrit lo-profile vaale balasaheb thoraat ko rajya congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya or uske baad party ikai kii gutbaji sataha par aa gai
 Since May, about a dozen leaders, including former ministers Kripa Shankar Singh and Harsh Vardhan Patil and MLA Nitesh Rane have said goodbye to the party
 thoraat ke naam par rahul or sonia donon kii hami mili thi, taaki maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantriyon ashok chavaan or prithviraj chavaan jaise kaddavar netaaon kii ore se kam virodh uthe
 But the central leadership showed no mercy with Milind Deora, who openly demanded a young skilled leader as Congress president in the 90-day period between Rahul's resignation and Sonia's return
 congress ke andruni sutron kaa daawa he ki devda ko party main ab koi poochta bhi nahin, jinhone loksabhaa chunaav ke baad mumbai congress adhyaksh ke pad se istipha de diya tha
 If the sources of the Congress are to be trusted, then Sonia's ears were raised by the demand of a young president for the party, which was first suggested by Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh
 haalanki shuruaati ranneeti party adhyaksh pad par gandhi parivaar ke ek lo-profile vafaadaar ko baithaana tha—jo sambhavat: tab tak rahata jab tak rahul apana vichaar badalakar adhyaksh ke rup main vaapasi nahin karte—lekin shashi tharur jaise netaaon ne chunaav kii maang kii to sonia phir se sochane par majaboor huin
 "she was never reluctant," says a member of the Congress Working Committee, wishing that the reins were in the hands of the Gandhi family
 chunaav hote or koi gandhi chunaav nahin ladata, to satta kisi yuva or sambhavat: adhik kushal vyakti ke haathon main ja sakati thi
 And even though such a Congress president is unlikely to continue in the chair for a long time due to the three Gandhis being active in politics, she does not want to take any risk
 unhen tharur, devda, jyotiraditya sindhiya or sachin payalat kii mahatvakankshaon par andeh hota ja rahaa he
 "this opened the doors for Sonia's loyalists
" party pramukh ke rup main unki vaapasi ke saath, jin logon ko rahul ke sheersh pad par kabiz hone ke baad pad mili the, unhen bhi apane pad chhodie pade
 Madhya Pradesh Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia's future now looks uncertain as the only voice of introspection and self-criticism at the CWC meeting on 25 May
 sindhiya ke liye kabhi madhya pradesh congress kaa adhyaksh pad pakkaa mana jaataa tha, us par philhal mukhyamantri kamalnath kabiz hai
 But when his supporters started targeting Kamal Nath and other state stalwarts Digvijay Singh, Scindia could not support him strongly as he had little support from Delhi
 ve loksabhaa chunaav haar gaye the, isse unki sthiti or kamjor hui
 Former Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam (who was enjoying Rahul's trustworthiness until March, but was then replaced by another of Rahul's favorite deodas) openly rebelled against the old stalwarts
 Given that he has been ignored in the ticket distribution for the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 puraane bharosemand kheme ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''main maanata hum ki sindhiya kii kuch vaastavik shikaayatein hai, lekin nirupam varisht netaaon ko kyon nishaanaa bana rahe hai? unhen rahul ne hataaya tha
 In Rajasthan too, there is speculation that Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot may soon appoint some more deputy chief ministers
 philhal yah pad gahalot ke pratidwandvi sachin payalat ke paas hi he
 Although some Congressmen argue that this could be a move to woo influential castes in the state, many see it as an attempt to cut the status of a pilot
 rajasthan congress ke 42 varshiya adhyaksh, jinhone party ko 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main party kii aguai karke use jeet dilaai, mukhyamantri banane kii res main gahalot se maat kha gaye kyonki gandhi parivaar ne puraane vafaadaaron par daanv khilne kaa faisla kiya
 "instead of keeping an eye on the chief minister's chair, he should focus on retaining his chair of Rajasthan Congress president," says a senior party leader
 ''vaise, sindhiya or nirupam kaa ab bhi party par vishwaas barkaraar he, lekin kai anya logon ne party ko alavida kah diya he
 In the Northeast, Pradyot Manikya Debbarma, a leader from the royal family who also has an association with the Scindia family, has left the Tripura Congress president
 debaburma tatkaaleen mahasachiv prabharee luijinho falero ke 'hastkshep' se pareshaan the, jinhone unhen vivaadaaspad rashtriya naagarikta register (enarasi) par apana rukh badalane ko kaha tha
 Debbarma, who represents Tripura's native population, is demanding NRC in his home state and is also fighting a case in the Supreme Court for the same
 unhone kaha, ''congress ke kai netaa hai jo bhaajapa ke paraamarsh par chal rahe hai or party ko nasht karne ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 After Debbarma's resignation, Falero was also removed from the post on 7 October
 lekin puraane sipahasalaron ne bhi apana prabhaav spasht rup se dikhaaya or 24 ghanton ke bheetar, unhen apane pad par behaal kar diya gaya
 But the biggest loser has been former Haryana Congress President Ashok Tanwar
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke kade virodh ke baavjood tanvar ko rahul kaa varadahast praapt tha or ve paanch saal se adhik samay tak pad par rahe
 In September, Sonia loyalist Kumari Selja replaced Tanwar, while Hooda became the chairman of the Election Management Committee
 ek maheene baad, vidhansabha chunaav ke tikat vitaran se naakhush, tanvar ne party se istipha de diya
 Without naming anyone, he said that some people sitting well in the Congress feel that they are God but they are behaving like demons to destroy people
 haalanki in logon ne rahul or sonia ke khilaaf kuch bhi kehane se parhez kiya he, lekin baagiyon ko jo baat sabase zyada chot pahunchaa rahi he, vah he unki durdasha ke baavjood gandhi parivaar kii udaseenta
 When the new Nizam of the party targeted him, Rahul did little to protect him
 asal main, 25 may ko pad chhodie ke baad rahul ne apane logon ko kinare lagaae jane ke kisi bhi rajnatik faisle main hastkshep nahin kiya he or khud ko apane nirvachan kshetra, vynad or soshal media plateformon par modi sarkaar ko nishaanaa banane tak simit kar liya he
 There is less than two weeks left in elections in Haryana and Maharashtra and he has suddenly gone on a foreign trip which shows his apathy towards the affairs of the party
 haalanki, unki gaiyr-rajnatik niyuktiyon par koi gaaj nahin giraayi gai he
 For example, Sonia has approved a proposal to re-organize the party's data analytics department as a 'technology and data cell' and has made Pravin Chakraborty the head of the cell
 puraane diggajon ne loksabhaa chunaav ke baad vishesh rup se chakravarti par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 He had alleged that Chakraborty had misled Rahul with fake data
 is coup se rahul ke ek anya vafaadaar or party ke sanghathan sachiv (haalanki kuch andruni sutara daawa karte hai ki keval 'aadhikarik pad' ke kaaran ve praasangik bane hue hai, or unki bhoomika ab party ke bheetar niyuktiyon ko lekar bayaan jari karne tak simit rah gai he) ke

 However, not all young leaders have suffered the brunt of new power in the party

 Two-time MP Gaurav is the son of former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi
 haalanki bade gogoi puraane netaaon ke pasandida nahin hai, lekin unhen gandhi parivaar main sabhi kaa bharosa praapt he
 After taking over Sonia, Gaurav, who holds the charge of West Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar, has also been given additional charge of two more states, Sikkim and Manipur
 sushmita divangat kendriya mantri santosh mohan dev kii beti hai, jo rajeev gandhi or sonia ke bahut kareebi the
 Although Sushmita lost the election in May, she remained the head of the Women's Congress and increased her penetration among the Gandhi family
 congress ke ek rajyasabha sadsy kehete hai, ''yuva netaaon ke khilaaf koi vishesh agenda nahin he
 The trouble is that many of these people got a lot from the party long ago

 In a video shot in the Parliament premises on 2 October, Hooda can be heard complaining to Patel that the candidates recommended by him were not given tickets

 Only 30 for Indian bowlers on the fourth day of the Fatullah Test
 1 over gendbaazi kaa mauqaa mil paaya
 Of this, 18 pair of r Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh
 1 over gend daalane kaa mauqaa mila
 In these eighteen overs, the pair of Bhajji and Ashwin spent 53 runs and took 3 wickets
 haalanki mausam vibhaag ke anumaan ke mutabik paanchaven din bhi 85 fisadi barish kii aashaanka jataai ja rahi he, lekin agar indra dev ne krupa kii or mausam vibhag kaa anumaan galat niklaa to kya team india ke of spinners kii jodi se ran rokte hue 17 wicket nikaalane kii ummid kii ja sakati he? It has been two-and-a-half times in Test cricket to fall 20 wickets in a single day
 fatullah test ke aakiri din aswin or bhajji kii nazar bhi bangladesh ko do baar out karne par hogi
 The question remains whether Indian bowlers will get this chance or not
 barish kii vajah se tisare din 462 ke score par pari ghoshit kar captain viraat kohli ne bangladesh ko ballebaazi ke liye utaara, to ek hi ummid thi ki aswin or bhajji kii jodi naiya paar laga sakati he
 Ashwin followed in-form Tamim Iqbal in the sixth over, while Harbhajan made Mominul Haque the victim of perhaps the most dangerous team
 lekin iske baad barish ne team india ko bebas kar diya
 The strategy of two off-spinners against six left-handed Bangladeshi batsmen seemed to work, but it was not very easy for these bowlers to get 17 wickets while stopping runs in the midst of continuous rain
 team india ke paksh main ye baat zarur kahi ja sakati he ki fatullah kii pich spinners ko madad karti he
 In the only Test held in 2005, 24 of 37 wickets were taken by spinners
 tippaniyan This is the reason that this pair of two right-handed bowlers is also expected against the season
 aswin or bhajji ko qareeb do saal baad ek saath vipakshi team ko bas main karne kii zimmedaari mili he
 The pair of Bhajji and Ashwin have got the chance to play only three Test matches together, in which the pair has given the victory to Team India twice
 ab sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki match ke aakiri ek din agar mausam ne saath diya to kya ye gendbaaz itihaas se aage badhane kaa karishma kar sakenge? Although, according to the meteorological estimate, 85 percent rain is being forecast for the fifth day, but if Indra Dev pleased and the weather forecast turned out to be wrong, then Team India's off-spinners pair scored 17 wickets to stop the run
 Can be expected? test cricket main ek hi din 20 wicket girane kaa karnama dhai-darjan baar ho chukaa he
 On the last day of the Fatullah Test, Ashwin and Bhajji will also be eyeing to dismiss Bangladesh twice
 bhartiya gendbaazon ko ye mauqaa mil paaegaa yaa nahin, ye sawaal zaahir taur par bana hua he
 After declaring the innings at 462 on the third day due to rain, captain Virat Kohli brought Bangladesh to bat, there was only hope that the Ashwin and Bhajji pair could cross Naiya
 aswin ne chathe hi over main form main chal rahe tameem iqbaal ko chalata kiya, to harbhajan ne shaayad team ke sabase khataranaak mominul haq ko apana shikaar banaaya
 But after this, the rain unleashed Team India
 baanye haath ke chah bangladeshi ballebaazon ke kilaaf do of spinners kii ranneeti kaam karti to dikhi, lekin in gendbaazon ke liye bhi lagaataar barish ke bich ran rokte hue 17 wicket nikaal paanaa bahut aasaan nahin
 It can be said in favor of Team India that Fatullah's pitch helps the spinners
 yahaan 2005 main hue iklaute test main 37 main se 24 wicket spinners ne hi nikaale the
 The comments yahi vajah he ki daanye haath ke do firaki gendbaazon kii is jodi se mausam ke kilaaf bhi ummid kii ja rahi he
 Ashwin and Bhajji have got the responsibility of putting the opposition team on the bus together after almost two years
 bhajji or aswin kii jodi ko ek saath sirf teen test match khilne kaa mauqaa mila he, jisamen is jodi ne do baar team india ko jeet kaa sehara pahanaaya he
 Now the biggest question is that on the last day of the match, if the weather supports, will these bowlers be able to move forward from history? test cricket main ek hi din 20 wicket girane kaa karnama dhai-darjan baar ho chukaa he

Actor Renuka Shahane, who has written on social media on burning issues, has shared a long post on her Facebook account and described the rape as a crime against humanity
 unhone kaha he ki peedit or aaropee kaa dharm kabhi myne nahin rakhana chahie
 Renuka's post comes after an 8-year-old gang-rape of Asifa and a rape charge leveled against a BJP MLA by a 17-year-old girl in Unnao
 146 shabdon main likhaa unka post viral ho rahaa he
 He wrote - Those who rape children do not have the right to live
 jo kisi bachche ke balaatkaar kii yojana banaate hai, jo is yojana main saath dete hai or saboot mitaane main madad karte hai or paise ke liye chup rahete hai-wo maanav nahin hai
 Farhan on Kathua gang rape said - If you are silent then you cannot be a human being, before that many syllabus have raised their voice against Asifa gangrape
 farhaan akhtar or simi greval ne apane folbers se ladki ko nyaay dilaane ke liye aawaaj uthaane kii guzarish kii
 Farhan said, just think what would happen to an 8 year old girl when she was gangraped for several days by giving her drugs
 uski jaan chale janaa bade dukh kii baat he
 If you do not consider it a terrible act, then you are not a human being
 agar aap use nyaay dilaane kii guhaar nahin laga sakate to aap kisi kaam ke nahin hai
 Imagine what goes through the mind of an 8 yr old as she is drugged, held captive, gang raped over days and then murdered
 If you don’t feel her terror, you are not human
 If you don't demand Asifa get justice, you belong to nothing
 — Farhan Akhtar (@faroutakhtar)april 12, 2018simi greval ne likhaa- sansar main insaan se zyada nirdayee jeev or koi nahin ho saktaa
 The people who raped Asifa are demons

 My only question is where is God
 There is no species ever created on this planet that is as cruel, as monstrous and as evil as the rapists of # Asifa
 And there is no punishment commensurate to their crime

 sanjay dutt kii byopic sanju 300 karod ke club main entry karne vaali he
 In this film, Ranbir in the role of Sanjay Dutt and Paresh Rawal in the role of Sunil Dutt including Sanju's friend Vicky Kaushal's acting has been appreciated by both critics and fans
 lekin is film ko dekhne ke baad ek khaas shaks kaa riection bhi saamne aa gaya he, wo he riya pillai
 Ranbir used to remember Sanju's dialogue by writing on his hand! Such Munna Bhairaria Pillai is Sanjay Dutt's second wife, both of whom married in 1998, but got divorced in 2008 due to relationship with Rishta
 riya ne jab film dekhi to wo hairaan rah gayi kyonki puri film sanju main riya kaa kirdaar puri tarah se gaayab hai
 According to DNA report, the film has shown many major ups and downs in Sanjay's life during the Mumbai blast
 us dauraan riya sanjay ke saath thim
 But he is not even mentioned in the film
 vaise sanju film main sanjay dutt kii beti trishala kaa kirdaar bhi gaayab he
 According to media reports, Trishala, Sanjay Dutt's daughter, is unhappy with her mother Richa Sharma (sanjay's first wife) and her character not being in the film
 haalanki trishala kii ore se is bare main koi statement nahin aayaa he
 Box office: Sanju at the door of 300cr on the 11th day, many records will be broken after one day Sanjay Dutt's biopic is making excellent records in terms of earnings
 is film ko byopic kehane se kai critic inkaar kar rahe hai
 The reason for this is that many important aspects and characters of Sanju's life in the film disappear very clearly

 sansad ne aadhaar ke jariye kalyaan yojanaon kaa laabh labhaarthiyon tak sidhe pahunchane vaale aadhaar vidheyak ko manjuuri de di
 In this bill placed as a money bill by the government, the Rajya Sabha returned the Lok Sabha with five amendments, although the lower house rejected these amendments
 isse pehle loksabhaa aadhaar (vittiya or anya sahayikiyon, prasuvidhaon or sevaaon kaa lakshith paridaan) vidheyak 2016 ko shuukravaar ko paarit kar chuki thi
 In the Rajya Sabha, where the ruling NDA is in minority, the Bill was discussed today
 vidheyak par congress sahit vipaksh kii ore se paanch sanshodhan pesh kiye gaye jise ucch sadan ne sweekaar karke loksabhaa ko waapas bhej diya
 Shortly thereafter, the government brought the bill back to the Lok Sabha and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, under pressure from the opposition in the upper house, urged the lower house to reject the amendments ranging from one to five as fatal, which the House Approved by voice
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ne in sanshodhano main rashtriya suraksha kii jagah saarvajanik apaat sthiti or saarvajanik suraksha shabdon ko samahit karne sahit mat vibhaajan ke jariye paanch sanshodhan vidheyak main samahit karaaye the
 The obligation to accept Aadhaar was also removed in these amendments
 isamen yah bhi samahit kiya gaya tha ki kisi vyakti ke bare main jaankaree saajha karne kii jaankaree dene vaale panel main sieji, sivisi ko bhi shaamil kiya jaae
 In the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said on these amendments that there were no such provisions in the similar bill brought by the UPA in 2010 and now the Congress is emphasizing these things and is creating complex idioms like public order, public safety, public emergency, the definition of which Is elaborate and may be misused
 unhone kaha ki lok suraksha or saarvajanik apaat sthiti to kahin kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti banane yaa kahin koi aapadaa aane par bhi kisi vyakti kii jaankaree kaa durupyog ho saktaa he
 No member of Congress was present in the House when this Bill came to Lok Sabha
 jetali ne is vidhyek ko dhan vidheyak ke rup main laane kii vipaksh kii aalochanaon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki is vidheyak kaa makasad sabsidi ke jariye sarkaar dwaara pradutt raashi ko uske sahi hakdaaron tak pahunchaana he
 Just because the government order has been challenged and the matter is pending in the Supreme Court, the Parliament's right to make laws cannot be postponed
 ullekhneey he ki sarkaar agar ise dhan vidheyak ke rup main nahin laai hoti tab ucch sadan dwaara naamanzoor kiye jane par vah ise aage nahin badha paati
 The Finance Minister said that it is different from that old bill because it has made the provisions of data privacy related to people very strict
 unhone kaha ki upie ke anubhavon se sikh lete hue hamane gopneeyata ke praavdhaanon ko sakht banaaya he
 Only when there is a matter related to national security can a person's data be shared
 rajyasabha main kai sadasyon ne is vidheyak ke kanoon banane kii sthiti main niztaa kii suraksha ko lekar chintaa jataayi
 Jaitley said that biometric data can be shared only in the matter related to national security

 Amid Tokatoki's discussion in the Rajya Sabha, Jaitley accused Jairam Ramesh of Congress of disrupting the path of a bill that was originally conceived by the UPA government
 jetali ne kaha ki rashtriya suraksha samvidhan main paribhaashit shabd he jiske apane myne hai or rashtriya suraksha ke sambandh main vyavhaarik hone par hi kuch jaankaree saajha kii ja sakati he
 The comments unhone kaha ki alpiji kaa maamla ek udhaaharan he ki jab isamen pratyaksh nakad antar kii vyavastha jodi gai thi tab kisi kisi ghar main 20-20 gas conection the or sarkaar kii sabsidi kaa paisa, un logon ko mil rahaa tha jo iske hakdaar nahin the

 In the Rajya Sabha, the opposition had introduced five amendment bills through the division of votes including public emergency and public safety in place of national security in these amendments
 in sanshodhan main aadhaar ko sweekaar karne kii baadhyataa ko bhi hataa diya gaya tha
 It was also included that CAG, CVC should also be included in the panel for sharing information about a person
 loksabhaa main jetali ne in sanshodhano par kaha ki 2010 main upie dwaara laaye gaye aise hi vidheyak main ye praavdhaan nahin the or ab congress inhen chizon par jor de rahi he tathaa lok vyavastha, lok suraksha, saarvajanik apaat sthiti jaisi jatil muhaavarey garh rahi hajiski paribhaasha vistrut he or iskaa galat istemaal ho saktaa he
 He said that information of a person can be misused even if there is a situation of law and order or there is a disaster in public safety and public emergency
 is vidheyak ke loksabhaa main aane par sadan main congress kaa koi sadsy maujuud nahin tha
 Jaitley dismissed the opposition's criticisms of bringing this bill in the form of a money bill and said that the purpose of this bill is to transfer the amount paid by the government to its rightful holders through subsidy
 keval isliye ki sarkari aadesh ko chunauti di gai or maamla ucchtam nyaayalay main lambit he, isliye kanoon banane ke sansad ke adhikaar ko sthagit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is worth mentioning that if the government had not brought it in the form of a money bill, then it would not have been able to take it forward if it was rejected by the Upper House
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki yah us puraane vidheyak se bhinn he kyonki isamen logon se jude aankadon kii gopneeyata ke praavdhaanon ko kaaphi sakht banaaya gaya he
 He said that learning from the experiences of the UPA, we have tightened the privacy provisions
 sirf rashtriya suraksha se jude maamla hone par hi kisi vyakti ke aankade saajha kiye ja sakenge
 Many members in the Rajya Sabha raised concerns about privacy protection in the event of the bill becoming law
 jetali ne kaha ki rashtriya suraksha se jude maamle main hi biomitric aankade saajha kiye ja sakate hai
 Officers above the rank of Joint Secretary will be able to decide the data sharing and a committee headed by Cabinet Secretary will review it
 rajyasabha main charchaa ke dauraan tokaatoki ke bich jetali ne congress ke jairam ramesh par aarope lagaaya ki vah aise vidheyak kii raah main vyavdhaan daal rahe hai jo mul rup se upie sarkaar kii pariklpana tha
 Jaitley said that national security is a term defined in the constitution which has its own meaning and some information can be shared only when it is practical in relation to national security
 tippaniyan He said that the case of LPG is an example that when a direct cash gap was added to it, then there were 20 to 20 gas connections in a house and the government was getting subsidy money to those who were not entitled to it
 gas conection ke maamle main hamane dhanadhy logon ko sabsidi ke daayre se hataane or garibon ko iske daayre main laana sunishchit kiya he

 There are only a few days left to cast votes in the Gujarat elections
 raajnneetik dalon kaa prachaar is samay jor-shor se chal rahaa he
 congress-bjp has fielded its star campaigners to woo voters
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi somvaar se morcha sambhaal liya he
 Since it is the home state of PM modi-amit Shah, bjp's credibility is at stake
 lekin is bich modi ne nayaa card chalaa he, ek baar phir raily main unhone apane conection ko bhunaaya he
 i am the son of Gujarat, repaying the debt, PM Modi addressed four rallies on Monday
 PM ke sabhi bhaashan main ek baat kaaman rahi vah tha ki 'main gujarat kaa betaa hum, gujarat kii janata congress ko maaf nahin karegi
 Modi said that Congress is constantly throwing mud at him, but he does not mind it
 modi baar-baar apane bhaashanon main logon ko yaad dilaa rahe the, ki unhen gujarat ne paala he
 Gujarat is like a mother to them
 vah jindagi bhar iskaa karj chukaate rahenge
 This is not the first time that during his speeches Modi has connected with the people of the place or people there
 pehle bhi aisa hota aayaa he
 Mother Ganga has called in 2014, when Modi came out of Gujarat and entered the politics of the country, he chose Varanasi
 jab modi namakan karne pahunche to kaha ki 'unhen yahaan maa ganga ne bulaayaa he, vah maa ganga ke bulaave par yahaan aae hai
 This statement of Modi was very much discussed during and after the Lok Sabha elections
 upi ne mujhe god liya2017 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi piem ne yahaan ke logon se apana khaas rishta banaaya
 During the campaign, Modi had said at Hardoi rally that he was born in Gujarat, but Uttar Pradesh has adopted him
 vah apane maa-baap ko chhodane vaale nahin hai
 'PM Modi said - UP adopted me, i am not the son of my parents, apart from this, PM Modi has mentioned these things in most of his rallies or programs
 chunki sangh prachaarak or bijepi kaaryakarta ke taur par unhone kai jagah kaam kiya he, isliye modi adhiktar rajyon main jaakar kehete hai ki unhone yahaan kai saalon tak kaam kiya he, vah yahaan ke logon ko jaanate hai
 Significantly, Modi is a good speaker and he knows how to make connections with people
 logon ko apane saath jodne kaa modi kaa ye anokhaa andaaj he
 Significantly, in Gujarat, votes will be cast on 9, 14 December
 pichley do dashakon se rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Since PM Modi had voted for the Lok Sabha elections in the country only by talking about the development model of Gujarat, his credibility is a question

 com / d1ratutmma— ANI (@ani)june 21, 2019 Mumbai's glare and speed has its own intoxication
 mayanagari naam ise yun hi nahin mila
 Once the rum is in this city, understand that it has settled here
 lekin 1980 ke dashak main mayanagari par jis shaks ne kabja karnaa shuru kiya, uskaa naam tha daaud ibrahim
 The world of the underworld is a name that ruled this legend
 daaud kii takat bana chota rajunderworld don daaud ibrahim ke ishaare par mumbai naachne lagi to uske khaas aadmi ban chukechhota rajan kaa kad bhi badhanelaga
 By the late eighties, Dawood had started speaking in Mumbai
 yahi wo vakt tha jab daaud kaa dar or daaud kii takat ko parde ke peeche rahakar jo shaks badha rahaa tha, log use bhi jaanane lage the
 That name was Chhota Rajan
 tikdi kaa matlab tha andervarlounderworld kaa har don mumbai par kabja karnaa chahta he
 Dawood captured Mumbai and showed his strength as Chhota Rajan
 anderworld kii duniya main kuch dinon ke liye wo vakt bhi aayaa, jab daaud ibrahim, chota rajan or arun gavali kii tikdi kaa matlab hi anderworld ho gaya tha
 Everyone started to panic in his name
 mumbai kaa king ban gaya tha daudamagarun gavali ke bhai ke murderke baad yah tikdi tut gai
 But Chhota Rajan remained the closest to Dawood
 chota rajan us vakt daaud kaa sabase bharosemand saathi ban gaya, jab usne anderworld don kareem lala ke bhattije samaad khan ko thikaane laga diya
 King of Mumbai became Dawood Ibrahim after the whereabouts of Mumbai's last Pathan don
 daaud-rajan ke bich aa gaye the shakeel or salemmumbai kaa king daaud hi tha
 But Chhota Rajan was instrumental in keeping King as King
 isi dauraan daaud or chota rajan kii dosti ke bich sabase pehle chota shakeel or baad main abu salem ne kadam rakhaa
 After the arrival of these two, Chhota Rajan started to be sidelined in Dawood Gang
 yahi wo daur tha jab chota rajan ne bangkok main apana dhandha shuru kiya
 Chhota Rajan emerged as a Hindu don and then came that day
 jisane anderworld kii duniya ko badalakar rakh diya
 It was 12 March 1993
 jab puraa mumbai shahar dhamaakon se gunj uthaa
 The Mumbai Blast also drew a line within the underworld, which was divided in the name of religion
 tab khooni gangvaar chhid gai
 Chhota Rajan and Dawood come face to face
 1994 main rajan ne daaud ke khaas saathi bakhtiyaar ahamed ko maut kii neend sula diya
 Dawood's anger became more angry after this murder
 1995 ke aakhir tak chota rajan ne khud ko ek hindu don ke rup main sthapit kar diya tha
 The Philosophy of the Underworld had changed Philosophy of the Underworld had changed
 mumbai kaa anderworld international ho gaya tha
 There may be a lot of difference between the face of Chhota Rajan and Chhota Rajan of that era, but many Raj of that era are still buried in Rajan's chest
 rajan ke seene main dafn hai kai rajaswaal yahi he ki wo koun se raaj hai, jinka khulaasa daaud kii chulein hilaa saktaa or wo kis baat kaa khauf he, jisaki vajah se chota rajan bharat aane se ghabara rahaa he
 This is the biggest question for which Mumbai is waiting for Chhota Rajan

 After getting prima facie evidence against Digvijay Singh, the court had asked him to appear in the court to face trial
 gadakari ne congress mahasachiv ke khilaaf manahani kaa maamla darj karaayaa tha
 Singh had accused Gadkari of having business links with his own party MP Ajay Sancheti

 Taking a dig at the rich nations for the emission of most greenhouse gases, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday advocated clean energy and said that market forces would not be able to finance it alone

 The issue of Jat reservation in Haryana again
 The Chautala family, who are struggling to preserve their political existence in the politics of 28 percent Jat voters in Haryana, have once again started raising the issue of 'jat reservation'
 jejepi netaa dushyant chautaala ke baad ab inelo pramukh omprakash chautaala or abhaya singh chautaala ne choudhary devilal kii jayanti par jat aarakshan ke mudde ke jariye satta main vaapasi karnaa chaahate he
 The INLD has started its election campaign by rally in Kaithal on Wednesday on the birth anniversary of Chaudhary Devi Lal
 is dauraan haryana ke chaar baar mukhyamantri rahe omprakash chautaala or abhaya singh chautaala ne bijepi-congress par hamalavar hote hue pradesh kii janata se jamkar vaade kiye or nae haryana kii tasviir dikhaai
 In Kaithal, the father-son duo of Om Prakash Chautala and Abhay Chautala blamed the BJP government for three times the violence in Haryana
 jat aarakshan andolan ke dauraan bigade halaat kaa zikr karte hue omprakash chautaala ne kaha ki itane begunaah logon kii jaan kabhi aaj tak nahin gai
 He said that the Bijpi government has spoiled the brotherhood of the state
 jejepi ke pravaktaa dalvir dhankhad ne kaha ki inelo se pehle dushyant chautaala ne kisaanon kii karjamaafee or jat aarakshan ke mudde ko uthaaya he
 In the last five years, the bjp's Khattar government has completely ignored the Jat community, as well as breaking the expectations of the entire community of the state
 jat aarakshan ke liye bijepi ne uthaaya kadamavahin, bijepi netaa jawahar yadav ne kaha ki jat aarakshan ke mudde par bijepi sarkaar ne thos kadam uthaaya
 Our government did the work of passing the bill from the assembly to give reservation to the Jat community, but if there is a ban in the Supreme Court, then what is our fault in this? unhone kaha ki jat aarakshan ke dauraan bigadate kanoon vyavastha ko dekhte hue kade kadam uthaae gaye the
 Although we have sympathy for the people who died, what could we do at that time
 vah kehete hai ki ham congress kii tarah nahin he ki 1984 kii tarah sadak par begunaahon ko marane ke liye logon ko chhod dete
 Senior Haryana journalist Pradeep Narula said that the Jat community is angry with the BJP, but it is divided among several political parties
 jabaki duusare samudaay kaa bada vot bijepi ke saath he
 In such a situation, there is not much reversal in the politics of Haryana by raising the issue of INLD and JJP
 haryana main jat kitne ahm?bataa den ki haryana main jat samudaay ke log aarakshan kii maang ko lekar kai baar sadak par utar chuke hai or kai logon kii isamen jaan bhi gai he
 Many crores of rupees of private and government property have also been damaged due to the reservation movement
 haryana main kareeb 28 fisadi jat matadaata hai or 90 vidhansabha siton main se 30 siton par king mekar kii bhoomika main he
 In such a situation, the political dominance of Jats in the state of Haryana continued till 2014, but the BJP has demolished the entire political equation by playing non-jat card
 aise main ek baar phir jat aarakshan kii maang uth rahi he, kya inolo or jejepi is mudde ke sahare apni satta main vaapasi kar paaenge? Singer Abhijeet has backed Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali not to have a concert in Mumbai and Pune

 According to 'AAP' candidate from South Delhi Lok Sabha Raghav Chadha, more than 5 votes add camp were organized inside Badarpur Assembly alone
 badarpur vidhansabha main yojit is camp ke madhyam se hajaaron logon ne apana vot banwaaya tha
 After this, all the information collected in these camps was given to the Election Commission and taking cognizance of our information, the Election Commission made the identity card of all these people
 raghav chaddha ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha ki "badarpur vidhansabha main vidhayak karyaalay se thodi hi duuri par lagbhag 200 pahchaan patr jo ki bilkul nae bane hue the, kachare ke dabbe main pade hue paae gaye
 When the Aam Aadmi Party workers got the news, they gathered all the identity cards and sent them to the party office
 in sabhi pahchaan patron kii jaanch kii gai to pataa chalaa ki yah sabhi voter ai card aam aadmi party kii ore se yojit kiye gaye camp ke madhyam se banawaye gaye the
 "further, Raghav Chadha accused the BJP and Election Commission officials that" BJP along with Election Commission officials and postal department officials are trying to get people whose voter cards are made after so much hard work by the Aam Aadmi Party
 Gone, their right to vote could not reach them
 aise main chunaav ayog un doshi afasaron kii jaanch kare, jinhone apni pant ke neeche khaaki nikkar pahani hui he
 "raghav Chadha alleged that these are the same voter cards with which the postal department envelopes were also present and had to reach the voters' house through post
 ek shadyantr ke tahat sabhi pahchaan patron ko kooday ke dibbe main phenk diya gaya jise aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ne kooday ke dibbe se baraamad kiya
 Raghav Chadha said that when the voter card of a voter is made, it is the constitutional duty of the Election Commission to take it to the voter
 hamen yah card jo kooday ke dibbe se praapt hue, ham iskaa vitaran nahin kar sakate
 That is why we are going to hand over all these cards to the Election Commission

 Taking a dig at the Sangh, he said that it talks about Hindutva, while the constitution talks of universal religion

 Addressing public meetings at various places on the fourth day of the election tour of western Uttar Pradesh, Rahul sarcastically said, 'mayawati has kept a magic elephant in Lucknow, which wastes the money of the poor and when the money of a department When the elephant licks, she removes the minister of that department
 vah in mantriyon ko hataakar unke vibhaag duusare bhrasht mantri ko de detii hai
 Questioning the BSP chief Mayawati's Dalit love, she said, 'mayawati calls herself a leader of Dalits, but not once in the last five years has she visited any poor house
 unase baat nahin kii
 Rahul said that it seems Mayawati is afraid of going among the poor, that's why she lives inside the 40-foot-high boundary

 i have come to change Uttar Pradesh
 garibi pichhadaapan hataane aayaa hum
 Politics means removing poverty backwardness
 indiraji ne yahi kiya tha
 Referring to the MNREGA, Rahul Gandhi said that the UPA government guaranteed 100 days of work to every unemployed for 120 rupees a year, but Mayawati said that it would not help
 unhone kaha ki kendra sarkaar desh main bhojan kaa adhikaar dene ja rahi he, to mayawati kahati hai ki yah majaak he isse kisi ko phayda nahin hoga jabaki iskaa sabase zyada phayda daliton ko hi hoga
 Rahul also targeted SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and said that when the Central Government gave reservation to minorities, he came in silence
 baad main kaha ki aarakshan kam diya kam se kam 18 fisadi aarakshan hona chahie
 He hit back at Mulayam and said that if he is so friendly to Muslims, then he should declare 18 percent reservation for him in his election manifesto

 gujarat main pichley kuch dinon se netaaon ke bich yah kaanaafoosee ho rahi he ki sthaneey netaaon kii andruni ladaai congress ko aage nahin badhane de rahi
 In fact, in the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress got the maximum 78 seats in the last five years
 jisase congress kaa gujarat cader utsahit tha
 After this victory in the state, major changes were made in the state unit of the Congress
 jisamen pradesh adhyaksh bharat singh solanki ko hataakar amit chaawda ko party kii kaman saunpi gai
 So Shakti Singh Gohil was made in-charge of Bihar and Alpesh Thakor was made in-charge
 lekin party main senior hone ke baavjood jimmedaari nahin milane kii vajah se kunwarji baawaliya ne istipha de diya
 At the same time, Alpesh Thakor has also been expressing his displeasure to the party high command for some time
 mana ja rahaa he ki gujarat congress main is kalah ko purv adhyaksh bharat singh solanki hawa de rahe hai
 While Paresh Dhanani is unable to keep pace with the Congress mlas and the organization
 congress vidhayak aashaben patel ke istife ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress ke 5 se 6 vidhayak istipha de sakate hai or bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard sakate hai
 Due to this infighting in Gujarat Congress, most of the Congress workers are upset and are gradually leaving the party and joining BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko gujarat se kaaphi ummid he, kyonki pichley chunaav main congress kaa khaataa bhi nahin khul paaya tha
 But with the party's good performance in the assembly elections, it was expected that the party's performance in the general elections would be relatively better

 The death of more than 130 children in Muzaffarpur in Bihar due to acute encephalitis syndrome has put the country's public health services in the dock
 chikitsakon kii baari kami se swasthya sevaayen khastahal hai
 Except specialists in the country, there is also a shortage of general practitioners
 jansankhya ke aadhaar par chikitsakon kaa nunatam anupaat durust karne ke liye hi desh main 40 hajaar se adhik chikitsakon kii jarurat he
 In response to a question in the Parliament recently, the Central Government has released figures for the shortage of doctors in 29 states and seven union territories
 haalanki manipur, meghalaya sahit purvonttar ke kai rajyon ke sateek aankade centre sarkaar kii ore se sansad main jari suchi main darj nahin hai
 At the same time, the government, in its defense, combines doctors of Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy with allopathy and states that the population-doctor ratio is good in the country
 ye aankade sirf sarkari aspataalon main chikitsakon kii kami ke hai
 Whereas, according to the report of the US CDDEP, there is a shortage of more than six lakh physicians in India
 garib pariwaron ke log ilaaj ke liye sarkari aspataalon ke hi sahare hote hai
 Because expensive treatment in private hospitals is not a matter of their control
 aise main sarkari aspataalo main chikitsakon kii kami se garibon kii sehat suraksha prabhavit hona lajimi he
 Most of the children who died in Muzaffarpur also belong to poor families
 chikitsakon kii kami ke aankadedesh ke praathmik swasthya kendron(piechasi) main chikitsakon ke 34417 pad manjuur hai, jisamen 27567 chikitsak tainaat hai
 Thus, the positions of 8572 doctors are vacant
 isi tarah saamudayik swasthya centre(siechasi) main 17321 padon kii tulana main 17019 chikitsak tainaat hai
 That is, there is a shortage of 2510 physicians on CHC
 jabaki jila aspataalon main 28566 sweekrut padon kii tulana main 24899 chikitsak karyrat hai
 That is to say, there are 3667 vacancies in district hospitals
 jabaki up mandal stareey aspataalon main bhi 7144 chikitsakon kii kami he
 There is a huge shortage of specialist doctors in government hospitals in the country
 swasthya mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 29 rajyon or saat centre shasit pradeshon main maanakon ke mutabik kul 22496 vishesh chikitsak hone chahie
 These doctors are surgeons, obstetricians and gynecologists, pediatrics etc
 chaunkaane vaali baat he ki jitne visheshgy chikitsakon kii jarurat he, utane pad bhi nahin sweekrut hai
 According to government figures, a total of 13635 posts of specialist doctors have been created
 isaki tulana main sirf 4074 chikitsak hi karyrat hai
 That is, 10051 posts are officially vacant
 is prakaar apekshit chikitsakon ke aankade se tulana karne par pataa chalata he ki chikitsak or jansankhya ke maanak ke anusaar 18422 visheshgy chikitsakon kii jarurat he
 What is the standard of population and physicians harsh vardhan haal main sansad main hue ek sawaal ke jawaab main bataa chuke hai ki 31 disambar 2018 tak bharat main rajya chikitsa parishad ke tahat kul 1146044 allopathy chikitsak panjikrut hai
 Out of this, 80 percent is estimated from the availability scale to 9
 17 lakh chikitsak karyrat hai
 This leads to a doctor-population ratio of 1: 1472 in the country
 vahiin, vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke maanak 1:1000 ke mutabik ek hajaar vyaktiyon par kam se kam ek chikitsak jaruri he
 The government says that 7 in the country
 63 lakh ayurveda, unani or homeopathy doctor bhi hai
 Assuming 80 percent availability, it is estimated that about 6
 10 lakh ayurveda, unani or homeopathy(aayush) chikitsak sakriy seva main hai
 Thus the association of these physicians with allopathic doctors has a doctor-population ratio of 1: 884
 jo ki dablyuechao ke maanak ke anuroop he
 However, health sector experts do not agree with the figures of allopathy practitioners by correcting the figures by unifying the number of doctors of Unani, Ayurveda and Homeopathy
 chikitsakon kaa sankat dur karne kaa sarkari formulakendre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki swasthya rajya kaa vishay he
 Nevertheless, the Central Government has taken several steps to increase the number of doctors
 masalan, sabhi emdi, emes paathyakramon ke liye shikshakon or vidhyaarthiyon ke anupaat ko 1:1 ke anupaat se badhaakar 1:2 tathaa radiotherapy, forensik medicine, sargical, manovigyaan aadi vishyon main is anupaat ko badhaakar 1:3 kar diya gaya he
 The maximum entry capacity at the MBBS level was increased from 150 to 250
 nae medical kalejon kii sthapana ke maanakon main chhot bhi diya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the age limit of working of professors in medical colleges has been increased to 70 years
 ritairement ke baad bhi chikitsakon kii niyukti kii vyavastha he
 After the # Metoo movement in Bollywood, many big filmmakers and actors are being accused

 taliban ne phir jari kar diya he farmaan
 This time the order of Taliban has come in the name of Pakistani Army and NGO
 batulla masood ke dabadabe vaale wajiristaan main taliban ne sena or enjio se kaha he ki wo is ilaake main charity kaa kaam band kare
 If not, the Taliban have threatened to bear the brunt
 saath hi taliban ne pakistanki charity sansthaaon se bhi is ilaake se dur rahane ko kaha he
 The Taliban has given a leaflet to the people who came to offer prayers in the mosques of North Waziristan
 usee parche main taliban kii ye dhamkee he
 According to the Taliban's decree, the army cannot set up any medical camp in Waziristan
 yahi nahin, paak sena ko wajiristaan ke gramin ilaakon main skool kholane, kuan khodne or aspataal banane kii ijaajat bhi nahin hogi
 The Taliban have threatened that the consequences would be worse if the army or an NGO continued its charity work in the tribal areas of Waziristan by ignoring its decree
 taliban kii dhamkee yaheen tak simit nahin he
 He has also warned the people of Waziristan not to avail the facilities of army-built schools and hospitals
 jo isaki nafarmani karegaa, use iskaa anjaam bhugatna hoga
 In fact, the Pak army has made war against the Taliban and the Taliban feel that under the guise of opening a school, building a hospital or digging a well, the Pakistan Army can strengthen its grip in Waziristan

 Due to the ongoing political violence in West Bengal, the stability of the state government has been clouded by crisis
 bhaajapa kii pradesh ikai tathaa centre ke kuch bade party netaa rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii vakaalat kar rahe hai lekin isko lekar party main ek raay nahin ban rahi he
 Governor Kesharinath Tripathi spoke to the PM recently on the issue of law and order in Bengal
 iske baad vah grahamantri amit shah or raashtrapati ramnath kovind se bhi mili or rajya kii sthiti ke bare main jaankaree di
 On this day, Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP General Secretary and in-charge of Bengal BJP also advocated imposition of President's rule in the state
 beete mangalvaar ko grahamantri amit shah khud raashtrapati se mili
 He also discussed about Bengal
 iske baad phir ek baar rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii charchaa ne jor pakadaa
 BJP sources say that on Thursday, BJP President Amit Shah's meeting with the party's central office bearers, state presidents and in-charge of the states also discussed about President's rule in Bengal, in which some leaders expressed the opinion that imposition of President's rule needed
 haalanki baithak main hi kuch varisht netaaon ne yah raay rakhi ki jaldbaaji main faisla lenaa thik nahin he praathmik koshish hinsa kii ghatnaon ko rokna chahie
 By imposing President's rule, the BJP may suffer a political loss
 baithak main yah baat bhi ai ki ek lambey arase ke baad rajya main bhaajapa ko lekar logon ne sakaaratmak rukh apanaaya he or loksabhaa main party 18 seat jeetne main safal rahi he
 In such a situation, it is necessary to indicate among the people that the BJP does not act with revenge and the BJP is a serious party
 party ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he ki vaise bhi mul rup se bhaajapa is paksh main nahin rahati he ki kisi bhi chuni hui sarkaar ko barkhaast kar diya jaae
 Whenever the BJP has ruled at the Center that no party government has been dismissed in any state
 bhaajapa kaa yah ricard rahaa he ki vah chunaav ke jariye sarkaar parivartan karti rahi he na ki sarkaar gira kar
 However, it was also put in the end that if the situation becomes uncontrollable, then the Central Government has no other option but to dismiss the Bengal Government, but at present, the situation is not like that, so the situation in the state is trying to normalize

 For them, resourceless poor, unemployed farmers have never been a problem
 unka maananaa tha ki agar kisaan kii pahunch bazaar or takanic tak ho jaae to vah bahumoolya thati ban saktaa he
 After dreaming, they did not succumb before realizing it
 apni kism ke har insaan kii tarah ve jujhane ko taiyaar the lekin khud ko badalanaa unhen manjuur nahin tha
 Amul then became a symbol of the original spirit of India
 agar koi vichaar unke aage rakhaa jaataa or ve apane nazariye main use piro lete to ve uske liye jaan laga dete
 It would be worthwhile to recall some of the words written on him from last Sunday till now
 masalan, pehla shabd he bhens
 In the cultivation of Asian farmers, the credit for getting the buffalo to identify a 'war horse' only goes to Kurien
 bhens ko duniyabar ke log nahin jaanate the kyonki europe or america main bhainsen nahin pai jaatin
 The first time he invited me to join his work was an international conference on buffalo
 bhale ham is disha main zyada kuch nahin kar paa rahe hon, lekin ham duniya ke kuch un deshon main se hai jo bhens ke jaev-sanvadrdhan par paisa kharch karte hai
 And all this is possible due to the milkman and his combative people
 ham bhul jate hai ki kai maamalon main ek aurat bhi kisaan ho sakati he
 Devki Jain has written an article reminiscing about how Kurien's interest arose in it
 or ek baar ke baad yah baat unke maanas kaa hissaa ban gai
 The knowledge they shared at the village level empowered women
 ve kehete the ki mahilaayein prajnan ke bare main sikh sakati hai or khud is prakriya par kaabo bhi kar sakengi
 His science and commitment kept him secular and logical
 ila bhatta ne yun hi unki tarif ke pul nahin baandhe hai
 Kurien was not an open-minded novice debater
 ve jisase sahamat nahin hote use chaka kar chhodte the
 Once an investigative person, who later became quite famous, showed that increasing milk production reduces the consumption of milk in some families
 ve is baat par ukhd gaye the
 When i told them that there was power because any family would like to use the increased income from the sale of milk to meet other needs
 unka jawaab tha ki saare arthshaastri sirf jabaan chalaate hai
 They believed that there should be regular elections in the cooperative
 har saal uske accounts kii jaanch honi chahie
 He hated corrupt and insidious people
 aakhri baar ve aanand diclaration naam ke bade aayojan main aae the, jahaan nai peedi ke sahakaari sansthaanon par baat hui thi
 He said clearly: Reformation or destruction
 gramin logon kii aay kaa ek-tihaai hissaa doodh se aata he or courian is baat ko samajhate hue iklauta kaamyaab model khadaa karne vaale shaks the
 30 years ago, he realized that not only machines, technology and cooperatives would work, managers would also be needed for this work
 irma (institute of rural management, aanand) se nikle un shuruaati snaatakon ko sunanaa kaaphi dilachasp he jinhen courian ne prerit kiya tha
 Sodhi, Shiv Kumar and Jnne are such such names
 ve yuvaaon ko kuch alag karne kii sikh dete the
 He says, "you spend more than four months in the village during your MBA
 hamaari tarah agar aap apane shuruaati kuch saal gaanv main bitaa len or gramin samasyaon ko hal karne main vakt lagaaein, to aapako koi takkar nahin de saktaa
 "apparently, not only good salary is preferred during placement in Irma, challenging jobs are also a problem
 yah desh kaa iklauta management institute he jahaan se nikalakar agar aap bahurashtriya company main chale gaye, to use khushi nahin hoti
 People ask me, what next
 darasal, is kism ke daur kaa kabhi ant nahin hota
 Following the path shown by Kurien, the National Dairy Development Board is also talking about cooperative institutions, self-help groups and producer companies
 kai enjio bhi aise hi model par kaam kar rahe hai
 NABARD is preparing financial products for these
 lekin in sabase upar, vargeez courian hamaare liye sabase badi viraasat yah chhod gaye hai ki hamaare aathirk sudhaar swadeshi ke raste hone chahie or hamen apni sharton par vaishvikaran kaa hissaa bananaa chahie, basharte ham aisa karne kii takat ajirth karen
 Those who do not understand this, they stand back not only towards Kurien but Indian history
