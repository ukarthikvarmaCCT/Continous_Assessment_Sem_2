 "this victory is intimidating, don't let it go head to head!" Arvind Kejriwal would not have said this after the amazing victory in Delhi
 yah sahaj madhyavargeey pratikriya he jo badi safalataa milane par kuch bighad jane kii ashanka se upajati he
 No matter how negative the fear, but it has its own strength
 siyasat kii duniya main hameshaa kuch gahare dar bhide hote hai jo ranneetiyon kii buniyaad banate hai
 Kejriwal's fear is justified
 unhen sirf unke hisse kaa sakaaratmak janadesh nahin mila he
 Bored and swollen expectations from a fresh wave have left him at the peak of risk
 isse akele kejariwal hi dare nahin hai, dar duusari taraf bhi he
 After eating and rubbing for two years, the new politics finally came to the pinnacle of power
 paaramparik siyasat ko isi kaa to dar tha
 There is also a third fear beyond the debates of politics
 log ab mahasoos karnaa chaahate hai ki kejariwal, gavarnence va siyasat ke bhrasht model ko kitna daraa pate hai
 In fact, no matter how bad the fears are, after the arrival of Kejriwal in mainstream politics, the politics of the country will be woven with a variety of competing fears, which will open the way for many changes
 kejariwal ko kyon darana chahie?kyonki unhen sarkaar chalaani nahin balki nai sarkaar banani he
 Governments in India went well, but the wait for new governance was not over
 sarkarein, is chunaav se us chunaav ke bich simat gayi isliye raajnneeti va gavarnence kaa fark dhundhala hota chalaa gaya
 Kejriwal cannot wipe the past, he started with the hope of a new governance, the movement and politics through which he became
 puraani raajnneeti satta main aane ke baad bhi siyaasi agrahon se mukt nahin ho paati, thik usee tarah kejariwal 49 din ke puraane prayog main andolankaaree agrahon se mukt nahin ho paae
 Hopefully they will change
 unhen mili naseehaton main yah sabak bhi shaamil hoga ki gavarnence kii maujuuda simaaon ke bheetar nae taur-tareeke ijad karnaa katai mushkil nahin he
 The Aam Aadmi Party should fear that its grand mandate rests on new and weak ground
 siyasat amoort he, gavarnence jindagi ko chooti he
 This mandate is not to govern but to run the government
 paaramparik rajnatik dalon kii jaden vicharadhaaraon, parampara, parivaar va bhugolic vistaar se poshan paati hai isliye chunavi paraajayon ke baavjood ve phir ug aate hai
 Kejriwal has nothing of the sort
 ve ummiido ke shikhar par khadey hai, taqatvar va pratispardhi raajnneeti se mukaabil hai
 Kejriwal must really feel the fear that a mistake was made, then who should fear Kejriwal? Who should be afraid of Kejriwal? Remember the December of 2011 when the Lokpal was being debated in Parliament
 raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara ke suurama dahaad rahe the ki parivartanon ke sabhi raste paaramparik raajnneeti ke dalan se guzarate hai
 Whoever needs change, he will have to step into the quagmire of party politics and do two or two hands
 kejariwal ne dalgat or chunavi siyasat ke jariye ek nahin balki do baar raajnneeti ke paaramparik dizin se inkaar ko mukhar kar diya
 Kejriwal is India's most tenacious leader in recent decades, who has come to unprecedented victory through a barrage of ink and the practice of grassroots movements, beating the masses
 kejariwal kii bhavy vijay, bhartiya raajnneeti main modi yug kii shuruyaat or congress ke adrishy hone ke baad kii ghatana he
 This huge victory has been crafted with great silence amidst the noise of Modi's popularity
 puraane dalon ko kejariwal se isliye darana chahie kyonki raajnneeti kaa yah start ap jabardast jan nivesh se shuru ho rahaa he
 Kejriwal has the overwhelming majority to form transparent governance by staying within the limits of the government, the old politics which has been stopped
 kejariwal kaa yah dar hameshaa bane rahanaa chahie ki ve paaramparik raajnneeti kii lakeer choti kar sakate hai
 What should be the fear of Kejriwal? General discussions in Delhi say that the first 49 days of Kejriwal were going to scare corruption
 bhrashtachar kaa prakope gata tha yaa nahin, pramaan nahin miltaa lekin logon ke nijee kisse or tajurbe bataate hai ki bhrashtachar kam hone kii thos ummid jarur bani thi
 This hope provided the basis for the Aam Aadmi Party to return
 bharat main tamaam utpaada sirf isliye mahange hai kyonki unki keemat main cat-kamishan kaa kharch shaamil he
 All schools charge hefty fees simply because there is an illegal cost of opening and running them
 vikasshil deshon main bhrashtachar pariyojnaon kii laagat 20 fisad tak badhaata he or mahangaai ko takat detaa he
 Chinese President Xi Jinping is creating fear to stop corruption because he fears people's anger
 kejariwal bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khauf bana sake to unke bahut se kaam apane aap sadh jaaenge
 The public knows to forgive, so after leaving power, the people who did not even give a house in Delhi gave Kejriwal 67 seats
 lekin janata ab jhatpat faisla karti he, vah paanch saal tak intjaar nahin karti, pehle maukey par hi sajaa bhi suna detii he
 Kejriwal is faced with competitive politics and a very impatient voter who wants to intimidate politicians so that they always do what they have said
 is voter ko aap sedist yaa nirmam kah sakate hai lekin kya karenge, janata to janardan he
 Instead of thinking of him as foolish, it is wise to be afraid of him
 shukr he ki bhartiya netaaon main yah samajhadaari badhane ke saboot milane lage hai
 Country liquor has become expensive in Delhi
 har bottle ke daam main das rupee kii badhotaree hui he
 At the same time, the cabinet has made changes in the license policy of English liquor
 dilli main deshi sharaab mahangi ho gai he
 The cabinet allowed this in its meeting on Monday
 bear, ram or whiski kii bikri ke liye license ke niyam bhi sakht kiye jaaenge

 First Khan Market and now the genie of sealing finally reached Meharchand Market on Lodhi Road
 buudhvaar ko subah se hi supreme court kii monitering cameti kii nigaraanee main mehrchand market main ceiling kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 If the shops were banned against illegal construction, then the stairs were sealed
 150 se zyada dukaanon vaale is market main kareeb 135 dukaane sil kii gai
 Most of the action took place at shops that tapped basements and upper floors
 ceiling drive ke chapet main do bank bhi aae
 Dena Bank and State Bank of India have been given a few days to cover their operations
 ceiling shuru hote hi dukandaaron main afra tafari much gai
 The sealing squad arrived with the police commissioner, so the shopkeepers' anger was of no use and all the shops in which the property was used incorrectly were sealed
 ab dukandaar pareshaan hai or sawaal puch rahe hai ki agar unhone apane bijness badhaane ke liye koi avaidh nirmaan kiya bhi he to phir puri dukaan ko kyon sil kiya ja rahaa he
 During the closure of business, will the government pay for their house
 mehrchand market association ke adhyaksh ashok sakhuja ke mutabik is puure market kaa reedeveopment plan kai saalon se taiyaar he
 Still no action has been taken so far
 hamen ceiling se koi aapatti nahin he, lekin emsidi bataaen ki jab propati ke saath chhedchhad hui yaa uskaa galat tareeke se istemaal hua to uske adhikari kya kar rahe the
 If the action is happening in shops, then it should be on the officers who allowed this to happen
 ceiling se emsidi main sattarudh bijepi bhi dabaav main he
 The core of the party is the voter business class and because of the sealing, he is very angry with the MCD
 bijepi ceiling ke dilli sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehra rahi he or jald hi supreme court kii monitering cameti se milane vaali he, taaki dukandaaron ko raahat dilaai ja sake
 The Delhi government has also announced that it will convene a special session of the Legislative Assembly after January 15 on the issue of sealing
 ceiling kii jad main aae tamaam dukandaaron ko kuch raahat dilaai ja sake
 The issue of conversion charge and ceiling will be heard in the Supreme Court on January 12

 According to the controversies regarding allowances, the former president can take fuel allowance if he uses his car
 or agar aisa nahin karte hai to sarkari gaadi istemaal kar sakate hai
 But he had asked the government to fill the fuel bill with the use of the vehicle and also to allow the use of private car
 pehali gaadi pasand nahin imaamle kii shuruyaat hui purv raashtrapati patil se pehali aadhikarik gaadi ko vaapis lene se
 Because they did not like this car
 iske baad purv raashtrapati ne ek badi gaadi kii maang kii lekin isaki anumati nahin mili to unhone idhan bhatta maanga
 The Maharashtra government objected to this, after which his office started using personal cars and the district administration provided him with a government car when she moved out of Pune
 maharashtra sarkaar ko jab is bare main jaankaree mili to unhone is par aapatti jataai or kendra ke samaksh yah maamla uthaaya
 Even before the controversy has arisen, Pratibha Patil, who was the first woman President of the country, has not come for the first time in the controversy
 jab vah raashtrapati thi to unke bete or purv vidhayak par bhi aise aarope lag chuke hai
 At the same time, his brother's name came in an alleged murder
 jab unhone pad choda to un par raashtrapati ke rup main milane vaale uphaaron ko apane saath le jane kaa aarope laga

 It is now functioning through Daltonganj FM

 The multistarrer film Saaho is in trouble with the release
 film ke ek gane main maujuud seen par bengaluru ke conteparary artist shilo shiv suleman ne unke artwork ko churaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Now in his support, actress Lisa Ray has also fiercely reprimanded Saaho's makers
 lija ne apane instagram acount par original artwork or saaho ke gane ke us seen kii photo share kii he
 With this photo, he has written a long post, saying that this work is wrong
 unhone likhaa, ''kya creativity he? kya art he? ye aata kahaan se he? ham jaanate hai ki ye kya nahin he? ye aapkaa soshal states nahin he
 This is not your job title
 ye aapkaa apiyarence nahin he
 "view this post on instagramwhat is creativity? What is art? Where does it come from? We know what it is not
 It’s not your social status
 It's not your job title
 It’s not your appearance
 It's not even the image you see in the mirror
 Creativity and its sister Art reach us from the sweet spot of the universe- the soul you might say- through mystery
 But i do know that the creator- artist is the channel for it
 Let me tell you how hard it is to birth anything original or authentic
 i personally labored for years over my book, quelled the doubts and noise from others and did not emerge until i had almost undone myself
 Because it’s a calling
 And when i was moving through dark spaces of self-doubt or hitting creative blocks, i would turn to the work that @shiloshivsuleman puts out into the world and shares on her Instagram handle for inspiration
 i can recognize when a creator works honourably and deeply, bleeding, sacrificing, unsleeping, stretching herself in the direction of emotional bravery to produce work that births those feelings we all look for in day to day life
 To feel inspired
 To feel alive
 That's why when something dishonorable happens, we need to stand up and speak up
 To hold up a mirror to these makers to make them understand THIS IS NOT RIGHT
 It's come to light that a big budget film production has ripped off one of Shilo's original creations
 This is NOT inspiration but blatant theft
 In no world, is this acceptable
 The production did not contact the creator, ask her permission nor offer to collaborate or offer a credit
 Nothing
 This is not right
 i believed the Hindi film industry was evolving necessarily past stealing storylines and rampant plagiarism but the producers of Shahoo have obviously not gained the memo when it comes to art
 Here’s the thing- Creators are worthy of worship
 What they produce are more lasting and precious so than all the other 'things' we accumulate that can be taken away
 Let’s hold these producers accountable for their infuriating, dishonourable action
 How would you feel if a thief slid into your home and took away your most prized possessions? Your heart
 Your soul
 And your livelihood

 Though the main battle is on the Ghosi parliamentary seat between the current MP of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Harinarayan Rajbhar and the SP-BSP alliance's joint candidate Atul Rai, but after rebelling from the BSP and joining the Congress, Balakrishna Chauhan entered the electoral arena Has made the match interesting
 baalkrishna chouhan ne pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke tikat par ladaa tha, lekin samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan ke baad basapa ko yah seat mili or usne atul kumaar singh urf atul raay ko pratyaashee bana diya
 Angered by this decision of the BSP, Balakrishna Chauhan rebelled from the party and joined the Congress and joined the electoral battlefield and his alliance seems to be difficult
 gathbandhan ko dohari mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 First, the rape case against his candidate and second, the tough challenge presented by the Congress
 vahiin, bhartiya communist party (sipiai) ne party ke rashtriya sachiv atul kumaar singh urf atul anjaan ko tikat diya he
 If Dalit and Muslim judges look at the caste equation in the Ghosi parliamentary seat, the most voters come from the Dalit community
 yahaan par 4
 There are 30 lakh Dalit voters, followed by Muslim voters whose number is 3
 32 lakh he
 Chauhan 2 after them

 62 lakh hai jo yahaan ke chunavi jang par apana faisla sunaayenge
 Kshatriya voters are also in large numbers and their number is around 1

 On the other hand, he says about BJP candidate Harinarayan Rajbhar that he is rarely seen in his constituency
 unhone koi vikaas kaary nahin kiya he
 Strict competition, the difference of victory Anshuman Singh, the state spokesperson of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, who is part of the alliance with the JDASP-BSP, says that whatever the BJP says, the alliance is looking strong in the entire state including Purvanchal and is giving a tough fight to the BJP 
 ghosi seat kii baat karen to yahaan bhi sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke jeetne ke asaar zyada hai
 He insisted that the fight is vigorous and no matter who wins, but the margin of victory and defeat will not be much
 ghosi main garibi, berogari, kisaanon kii badahaal sthiti, band milon ko chalaane, over brij or bunakaron ke liye vipanan centre banaae jane samet kai ahm mudde hai
 State spokesman of Rashtriya Lok Dal Anshuman Singh says that no development work was done in the area
 kisaanon kii sthiti badahaal he
 The youth are wandering unemployed
 yahaan par sadakon kii sthiti jarur thik hui he, lekin anya kshetra main sarkaar naakaam rahi he
 The SP-BSP alliance may be in tension due to the case being run against its candidate, but the caste equation seems to be in its favor

 In such a situation, if the coalition candidates succeed in uniting the Dalit, Yadav, Muslim and Bhumihar votes, then Modi's magic may fade here

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Yogi have appealed to win Rajbhar by holding a public meeting in Mau under Ghosi parliamentary seat on Thursday
 kalpanaath raay kii dharti par is baar chunaav kaa kya maahaul he or kya vahaan par 2014 kii tarah modi lahar kaa asar dikh rahaa he
 On this, CPI candidate Atul Anjan says that there is no such thing as Modi wave
 pradhanmantri modi kii sabha main zyada log nahin aae the
 At the same time, when talking about BSP chief Mayawati's rally, only 100-200 women attended there
 anshuman singh bhi kehete hai ki kshetra main modi lahar jaisi koi cheez nahin he
 Atul Anjan also says that MP Harinarayan has done nothing
 vampanth kaa garh2014 main modi lahar main bijepi ko ghosi seat par aitihaasik jeet hasil mili thi, tab party ke ummidavaar harinarayan rajbhar ne basapa ke daara singh chouhan ko haraakar apni party ke liye yahaan se khaataa kholaa tha

 49 per cent of the votes are received, which is less than 2 per cent of the votes of BJP
 harinarayan ne yah chunaav 1,46,015 maton ke antar se jeeta tha
 Talking about Ghosi's parliamentary history, it is one of the few seats in the state that has been known for its stronghold
 purvanchal main vampanth kaa garh kahe jane vaale ghosi sansadeey seat par bhartiya communist party (sipiai) kaa lambey samay tak kabja rahaa
 In 19 Lok Sabha elections held since 1957, the Congress has won 4 times, while the CPI has won 5 times
 1957 ke chunaav main congress ko pehali jeet mili
 On the other hand, Kalpath Rai won the elections on Congress ticket 2 times, but to win the election here he had enough of his own image
 baad main nirdaleey pratyaashee ke rup main bhi unhone chunaav jeeta tha
 Talking about Kalpathakalpnath Rai, who was a five-time MP, Ghosi seat gained considerable recognition in the name of Kalpnath Rai, who jumped into student politics while studying at Gorakhpur University
 congress ke tikat par kalpanaath raay ne pehali baar 1989 main jeet hasil kii thi, phir vah 1991, 1996 or 1998 main jeet kar loksabhaa pahunche
 He won the 1996 election as an independent candidate after a split with the Congress
 iske baad 1998 main samta party ke tikat par vah chauthi baar loksabhaa pahunche
 Apart from this, he was a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha in 1974–80, 1980–86 and 1986
 congress raaj main vah kai baar mantri bhi rahe
 During the tenure of Narasimha Rao government, he was the Food Minister (independent charge) and during this time he was accused of scam
 vah indira gandhi ke kaarykaal main bhi mantri rahe
 After the death of Kalpnath Rai in 1999, other parties got out of the way and BSP (1999), SP (2004), 2009 (BSP) and 2014 (BJP) won from this seat
 bijepi ko 2014 main pehali baar yahaan se jeet mili thi
 The Ghosi parliamentary constituency consists of 5 assembly constituencies (madhuban, Ghosi, muhammadabad-gohna, Mau Sadar and Rasra), in which only the muhammadabad-gohna seat is reserved for the Scheduled Castes
 in 5 vidhansabha seat main se 3 par bijepi kaa kabja he, jabaki 2 par basapa ne jeet hasil kii hui he
 After the SP-BSP alliance, the election on Ghosi parliamentary seat has become very interesting
 gathbandhan ke ummidavaar atul raay par rape cese chal rahaa he or vah faraar bataae ja rahe hai, lekin gathbandhan ke chalate unki sthiti abhi bhi majboot he
 So while BJP is trying to save its supremacy again on the basis of Modi wave and Yogi's charisma, the Congress has made the election interesting by fielding BSP rebel Balakrishna Chauhan

 ve kehete hai, ‘‘har maamle main kam se kam 80-100 pej kii file kii jarurat hoti he or in ladakiyon ne is kaam ko usee junun or vyagrata ke saath sambhaal liya he, jaise koi machhlee pani ke liye dikhaati he

 amritsar kii 30 varshiya roopinder cor emb hai
 She was married to a Canadian citizen of Ottawa in 2015 but the husband fled seven days later
 roopinder kahati hai, ‘‘ab tak hamane 75 passport nilambit karne main logon kii sahaayta kii he
 ʼʼ There are also 16 other files on which copies of loc from Punjab or Haryana Police are awaited
 iske alaava australia, canada, america, newjiland, italy, spain, germany or britain chale gaye bhagode enarai patiyon se sambandhit anya kai maamle bhi hai, jinaki filein taiyaar kii ja rahi hai
 Reena says that besides assisting the victims in paperwork , this cell also serves as a counseling center for them
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘ladakiyon ko lagata he ki unke paas koi aisi jagah to he jahaan unki baat ko sahanubhutipurvak suna jaataa he or sahaayta kii jaati he

 chandigarh se hi sate mohali main punjab police kii enarai wing in parityakta dulahanon ke maamalon kii jaanch karti he
 The seriousness of this problem in Punjab can be gauged from the fact that it is the only state in India where there are 15 NRI police stations in the districts and officers of Assistant Inspector General (AIG) rank posted in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Patiala
 Huh
 yah pehla rajya he jahaan hycourt ke ritred jaj kii adhyakshata vaala enarai ayog he
 But the investigation is very tedious and time consuming
 is wing kaa netritv kar rahe atirikt police mahanideshak (edijipi) ishwar singh kehete hai ki aisa isliye he kyonki abhiyukt achaanak gaayab ho jate hai or videshon main kahaan rah rahe hai, isaki jaankaree nahin hoti
 Despite the difficulties, the NRI wing has issued 624 locs since 2016 and declared 324 nris and pos to foreign passport holding Indians
 iske alaava isane anya deshon main police or court ke jariye 91 saman bhi jari kiye hai
 However, Ishwar Singh admits that the pace of work is somewhat slow, but he considers this to be the flood of such cases
 amrit kii shikaayat he ki enarai police steshnon ke karmchaaree dhime hai or peediton kii pareshaaniyon ko lekar aksar ve samvedansheel nahin rahete hai
 "they also refuse to give copies of the loc for weeks, saying that it is a confidential document, which can only be given to a competent officer," says Amrit
 ʼʼ iskaa matlab he ki abhiyukt ko aksar palaayan kaa ek aasaan jariya mil jaataa he
 On the other hand, see the case of Fatehgarh Sahib's Amarinder Kaur, who had also told the NRI Wing that the accused had started the process of renewal of work visa for Italy, yet they were not given a copy of the loc
 amarinder kahati hai, ‘‘yadi samay rahete italvi imigration adhikariyon ko satark kar diya gaya hota to uskaa italy kaa vija aage nahin badha hota
 The Passport Office of Delhi also suspended seven passports this year, but the victims say that there is no activity in taking action here
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar adhikari aise maamalon main padana hi nahin chaahate kyonki inaki adalati karrwai varshon tak chalati he or unhen bhi court ke chakkar lagane padate hai
 Smita Kudasia, a Delhi-based victim who is part of Togetherwecan, says, "in RPO Delhi, there is always slowness and always pretends that the process of revoking the passport is too complicated
" ʼʼ group ke blog ko chalaane vaali kudasia yah bhi kahati hai ki kendriya mantri menka gandhi ‘‘ko is baat kii galat jaankaree di gai he ki ab sabhi passport daftaron main passport nilamban se judi karrwai sucharu rup se hoti he
 This is despite the recommendations of a nine-member foreign ministry committee set up in 2017
 sevanivrutt jaj arvind ke
 The panel, headed by Goyal, suggested several changes, including issuing locs against the runaway husbands and confiscating passports
 iske aadhaar par, sarkaar ne aise maamalon se judi prakriya ko tej karne or aise bhagodon ko trek karne ke liye dablusidi sachiv rakesh shrivastav kii adhyakshata main ek integrated nodel agency (iene) kii sthapana kii, jisamen videsh or grih mantralayon ke pratinidhi bhi shaamil hai
 However, not much work is being done on land except Chandigarh

 Insiders say that there is no coordination and consensus between the Union Law Ministry and the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare to revoke such passports
 isse pehle, kanoon mantralay ne enarai duulhon ke khilaaf jari saman kii jaankaree website par post karne ke videsh mantralay ke prastaav par bhi aitraaj jataayaa tha
 The Ministry of External Affairs is working on several proposals, including an amendment to the Passports Act, which allows nris who fail to register their marriages within the stipulated period to suspend their passports
 enarai pati ke passport par patni ke vivaranon ko anivaary rup se shaamil karne ke prastaav par bhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Although registration of marriage has been made compulsory in Punjab in 2012 (since 2007 only in Haryana), it is impossible to implement
 chandigarh sthit parivaar kanoon visheshgy anil malhotra kehete hai, ‘‘jab tak hindu vivaah adhinium (echeme) or anya dharmik vyaktigat kanoonon main sanshodhan nahin hote, tab tak shaadi ke panjikaran kaa koi khaas matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 प्रयास Efforts like togetherwecan are demanding change rather than a solution for women struggling with problems
 kudasia or anya ne prastaavon kaa ek set taiyaar kiya he, jise agar lagu kiya gaya to enarai se vivaah main jahaan aaj mahilaon ko apane adhikaron ke liye thokaren khaani pad rahi hai, fariyaad kerani pad rahi he, beete daur kii baat ho jaaegi

 Union Minister Hegde said, 'they need proof, how will these people give proof of how a Muslim's son (rajiv Gandhi) has become a Brahmin? How will this human (rahul Gandhi), born of a Muslim father and a foreign Christian mother, become a Brahmin, will he give proof of this? ”with this he said,‘ i am not joking
 on record bol rahaa hoon, jab rajeev gandhi kii maut hui, tab pahchaan ke liye diene test karne ko kaha gaya
 At the time there was talk of taking Rahul Gandhi's DNA, Sonia refused
 or kaha ki priyanka gandhi kaa diene test kar lo
 Now what is the truth, you all know and these people are asking for proof from us, it is not the status of these people to ask for proof from us
 'bataa den, kendriya mantri anant kumaar hegade ne janvari main bhi aisa hi bayaan diya tha, unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko ‘mishrit nasl' kaa bataate hue kaha tha ki ek ‘muslim' pita or isai maa kaa betaa brahman kaise ho saktaa he
 He also attacked Rahul Gandhi for targeting the Narendra Modi government (modi Govt) on the Rafale deal

 ' Before getting married, we see individuals, money and family

 But sometimes it happens that we fall so much in love with the partner that we ignore many important things
 aaie jaanate hai ve kya chijen hai jo shaadi se pehle aapako jaan leni chahie
 1
 partner kaa maansik rup se taiyaar hona bahut jaruri he
 Find out if your partner is not getting married under parents or any other pressure
 kya vaaki pyaar karne se badhata he vajan? jaaniye kya kahati he study2
 It is very important to have the right information about the husband's job
 kai baar sirf kehane se vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie
 Not only a job, you should also know the correct salary
 3
 Such questions should also be asked to the partner that after marriage they would like to stay apart or with the family
 shaadi ke baad agar aap nahin chaahate ki ve aap par kisi tarah kaa dabaav banaaen to in sawaalon kaa jawaab jaan lenaa behatar hoga
 To take your partner's test, definitely do this one thing4
 agar hone vaala pati naukari nahin karata he to unki nivesh or aarthik sthiti ke bare main puuchhen
 Find out if they depend on someone else
 5
 Try to know your partner's likes and dislikes
 ho saktaa unki koi aadat yaa pasand aapako bilkul naapsand ho
 Such things lead to quarrels later
 6
 Before marriage, know what your partner thinks about family planning
 bachche kab or kitne karne hai ye pataa karnaa bahut jaruri he
 If you know beforehand, then you will be able to prepare yourself mentally

 bhaajapa pulavama maamle kaa raajnneetikaran kar rahi he
 Jitendra Singh, who is close to Rahul Gandhi and the Minister of State for Defense in the Manmohan Singh government and has been given independent charge of youth affairs, said that the army's action should not be politicized
 bijepi ke purv mukhyamantri kah rahe hai ki ab karnataka main unki 22 seat aa jaaengi

 During my stay as Minister of State at the Center, whenever the surgical strikes took place, we did not applaud it, but the BJP is not deterred from doing politics this time
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa netaaon ko yah sab baat chhodkar logon ko 5 saal main karaae gaye kaaryon kaa hisaab dena chahie
 Now the people have no faith in the BJP government
 bhaajapa sarkaar vot ke liye kuch bhi kar sakati he

 Earlier, Jitendra Singh said that the Prime Minister of our country was busy in a shooting in Nainital on the day of Pulwama attack
 unako hamale kii jaankaree 2 ghante pehle hi maaloom pad gai thi
 But he did not give up his shoot
 unhone poocha tha ki yah baat desh ke pradhanmantri bataaie ki us vakt vah shooting chhodkar apane sainikon ki madad ke liye kyon nahin gaye, kyon unhone ection nahin liya?airstrike ko lekar lagaataar congress ke nishane par bijepijitendra singh ke alaava congress, trinmul congress samet kai dalon ke netaaon ne airstrike ko lekar bijepi par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya

 Let us meet you today with those views, bring those pictures in front of you, which you will not even want to see
 lekin kya kiijie sahib, ye hamaare or aapke aasapaas lagaataar dikhaai de rahe hai
 In the midst of all this, the heart wants to say only one thing that let your country remain this country of India
 linchistan mat banaaie
 Because on this whole planet earth, this country is the only country which has given the message of Vasudeva, family and family to the whole world

 And these are Indians
 par bharat ke andar hi in bharatiyon jaisaa anjaam ham main se shaayad hi koi bhugatna chaahe

 Talking politicians, who bake the loaves of governance by sowing seeds of politics, are talking about the profanity of criminal law and obscenity law
 ji haa, ye mob linchig he
 It is called mob lynching when a crowd is surrounded by people from all four sides, and people are taking turns in the middle with a kick, punches, ballons, sticks and stones
 lekin abhi tak jo hamane dekha samajha tha, usamen bheed kaa hamalaa hameshaa us par hota he jo itnaa taaqatvar or furtila ho ki use bas main karnaa kinhin ek-aadh logon ke bas main na ho
 Like to surround a lion
 lekin ye manzar to wo nahin he
 See this person trapped in this crowd
 yah to majaboor lag rahaa he
 There is nothing left to defend it with weapons
 baari-baari se agar in tasveeron ko dekh len
 All seem helpless, helpless, helpless
 ab ise aap agar mob linching kah rahe hai to phir sochiye, sochie kyonki yahaan tomob linchingke bhesh main kinhin khaas logon ko hi nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Yes, it is also true that it cannot be considered prudent to draw any result from such two-four incidents
 lekin jab aisi hi do-chaar darjan ghatnaayen ho jaaen to phir khamosh rahanaa bhi samajhadaari kii baat nahin hoti
 We have to understand it and understand it quickly
 kyonki jab har khidki band ho jaaegi

 rajya sarkaar iskaa istemaal khelon ke centre ke taur par karnaa chaahati he
 In 1988, the then Defense Minister K

 '' pehle bhi yah maamla 1999 main dhumal prashasan ne uthaaya tha, par sena ne jameen lautaane se inkaar kar diya
 The Chief Minister is also angry that the army has tried to wrap up his MP son Anurag Thakur in this dispute
 himachal pradesh cricket association kaa adhyaksh hone ke naate thakur ne yahaan stadium banane ke abhiyaan kii aguai kii thi
 In October 2011, Thakur launched this campaign once again

 bhartiya film udyog main amitabh bachchan sirf ek kalakaar nahin hai balki unki pahchaan hindi ke pairokaar ke rup main bhi he
 As much as he strived to reach the pinnacle of acting, in the same way he has also worked to bring Hindi value in this industry
 aaj bhi ve koun banegaa karodpati jaise reality game sho ke madhyam se hindi ke aise shabdon ko prachaarit karne main apana yogadan de rahe hai jise nai peedi sahi dhang se uccharit nahin kar paati he-adbhut
 It is not that Amitabh is the only advocate of Hindi
 lekin yah sach he ki ve is maamle main badi line kii tarah dikhte hai
 Along with them, Shatrughan Sinha, Raj Babbar and Mithun Chakraborty are also among those who promote Hindi
 inase prerit hokar yah kaaravaan aage badha he or isamen aaj hamen aamir khan, manoj vaajapeyi, saurabh shukla, sanjay mishra or pankaj treepathi jaise kai kalakaar bhi dikhte hai
 It is true that most people of this industry who eat bread from Hindi films eat, sleep and live in English
 ek hindi film ke liye patakatha, samvaad, gane ke lekhan or nirdeshak kii ore se kalakaar ko abhinay ke liye ishaare bhi angreji or roman main hote hai
 The world of Hindi films is in Mumbai and it also has its own Hindi in the metropolitan civilization in which English gets a minor place
 lekin samay kii dhara main angreji ke shabd bollywood ne apana ghar badi teji se basaa liya he or is shabd ne hindi cinema kaa sanskaar mundan is tarah se kar diya he ki ab kaagaj se lekar munh main bhi yahi shabd gilori paan kii tarah lagata he
 However, the term had also started hitching in the seas of Hindi cinema ever since Amitabh Bachchan was rising to the pinnacle of acting in the seventies
 tab bhartiya cinema bhi apane aadhunik kaal main tha or vyavsaayik cinema yuva kaal main tha
 salim-javed was paired with Amitabh in writing and Hidustani was adding to the vibrancy of Hindi cinema
 amitabh hindi pattee se aae kalakaar hai or unamem babuji (mahakavi harivansh raay bachchan) kaa hindi sanskaar bhi he
 Despite this, he has made Hindi feel like a soul in Hindi films
 tabhi to jab unase poocha gaya tha ki mahanayake amitabh bachchan ke putr abhishek bachchan ke kariyar main unki tarah oonchai kyon nahin dikh rahi he? iske jawaab main ve ek pita or ek kalakaar donon dikh rahe the
 He had said that in Hindi cinema you have to enter the soul of Hindi only then you will take over the hearts and minds of the audience
 nae jamaane ke hisaab se angreji abhishek kaa peechha nahin chhod rahi he jisase unhen baahar nikalnaa padegaa
 There is no shortage of acting arts in Abhishek and just being the son of Amitabh Bachchan cannot be successful
 apane bete ke bare main bindaas khyaal rakhane vaale amitabh ne hameshaa bollywood shabd kaa bhi virodh kiya he jisase hindi cinema kii samskruti ko khatra he
 They do not like to hear the words Bollywood and speak more and more in Hindi
 unka kahana he ki hindi cinema ke liye bollywood shabd sahi nahin he
 Because it is a word born from the stomach of English which does not have the soul of Hindi
 mumbai main hindi main filmein banati hai or hamaara astitv pehle se hi bhartiya cinema or hindi cinema ke rup main he to ham angreji ke bollywood ko kyon maane
 Many actors and filmmakers do not accept the word Bollywood with Amitabh, combining the words Bombay and Hollywood Wood
 lekin angreji daan is shabd kaa prayog dhadlle se kar rahe hai
 Advocates of Hindi Amitabh have now started giving answers to English leaders by churning out Hindi words for selfies
 unhone selfi ke liye hindi shabd banaaya he or vah he- vaday sah usch yani vyaktigat dhoorbhaashit yantra se hast utpaadit swa chitra'
 It should be used by those who are fond of the word Bollywood

 The Gujarat Congress on Saturday criticized the praise of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in articles published by Time magazine and Bukralin Institute, saying these articles contained false facts related to the development of Gujarat

 Journalism and reporting should be balanced and fair
 main aashcharya main hum ki inamen sirf unheen logon ke kathan kyon shaamil kiye gaye jinhone modi kii tarif kii
 These articles are biased and therefore inappropriate with the people of Gujarat and the country
 bucralin santhaan ne bhi haal hi main modi kaa ek saakshaatkaar praakashit kiya tha jisamen gujarat ke vikaas ko lekar modi kii prashansa kii gayi he
 Time magazine, in its March 26 issue, published an article on Modi stating that 'modi means business', adding one more thing that 'but can he lead India?' State Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil told reporters that he was disappointed with these articles
 patrakarita or reporting santulit or nishpaksh honi chahie
 i wonder why these were included only by those who praised Modi
 ye lekh pakshpatpurna hai or isliye ye gujarat or desh ke logon ke saath ninsaphi he
 The Buchralin Institute also recently published an interview of Modi praising Modi for the development of Gujarat

 The local people caught him at the same place and after beating him handed over to the police

 The Congress termed the confidential meeting of the National Security Advisors (NSA) of India and Pakistan in Bangkok as a 'huge fraud' of the Modi government and said that it shows how 'lax' the government's Pakistan policy is
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha, 'yah bahut bada dhokhaa he
 Whatever this government has said publicly, it is a deception
 ' bangkok main enese ajit dobhaal or unke pakistani samakaksh nasir janjua kii mulaakaat ke bare main puche jane par tiwari ne kaha ki pehle ek-duusare par aarope-pratyarope karne ke baad vaarta radd karne ke baad ab gupachup mulaakaaten kii ja rahi hai
 He said, 'if you look at the track record of the last 18 months of this government, their Pakistan policy has been absurd, reversible, wavering and 180 degree U-turn
 ' tiwari ne kaha ki bhartiya videsh mantri or pakistan ke tatkaaleen enese main jubaani jang ke bich ab achaanak bina kisi uksaave ke, bagaiyr desh ko bataae hue ki sitambar 2015 or disambar 2015 ke bich kya badal gaya, sarkaar ne phir se baatcheet karne kaa faisla kiya or vah bhi bangkok main
 The Congress leader said that if the talks were as urgent, the government should have explained the reasoning behind it and held talks in New Delhi or Islamabad
 baharhaal, bijepi pravaktaa nalin kohli ne enese vaarta kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki yah upha main pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke pakistani samakaksh navaj sharif ke bayaan kii bhaavana ke anuroop hua he
 The comments kohli ne kaha ki media kii najar or bharat-paak sambandh ko lekar paidaa hone vaale utsaah se bachane ke liye bangkok main baatcheet kii gai
 Welcoming the talks, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that talking away from the glare of media can lead to 'silent progress'
 bharat or pakistan ne vaarta prakriya behaal kii, yah dekhakar acha laga
 Meanwhile, Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the NSA talks between India and Pakistan do not generate 'much enthusiasm', as a lax attitude has been adopted since the Modi government came to power
 surajevaala ne kaha, 'iske alaava, yah vaazib chintaaen paidaa karti hai ki kya yah maujuuda raajnneetik or aarthik chunautiyon ke saath-saath vyapak krishi sankat se desh kaa dhyaan bhatakaane kii koshish nahin he
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari said, 'this is a big fraud
 is sarkaar ne saarvajanik taur par jo bhi baaten kahi thi yah un sabase dhokhaa he
 Asked about the meeting of NSA Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Nasir Janjua in Bangkok, Tiwari said that they are now meeting in secret after cancellation of talks after accusing each other
 unhone kaha, 'yadi aap is sarkaar ke pichley 18 maheenon ke trek record ko dekhen to unki pakistan niti betuki, ulat-pher vaali, dhulmul or 180 degree you-turn vaali rahi he
 'tiwari said that between the Indian foreign minister and the then NSA of Pakistan, the war of words in the NSA, suddenly without any provocation, without telling the country what changed between September 2015 and December 2015, the government decided to renegotiate And that too in Bangkok
 congress netaa ne kaha ki yadi baatcheet itani hi jaruri thi to sarkaar ko iske peeche kaa tark bataanaa chahie tha or nai dilli yaa islamabad main baatcheet kerani chahie thi
 However, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli supported the NSA talks, saying it was in line with the sentiments of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in Ufa
 tippaniyan Kohli said that talks were held in Bangkok to avoid the eye of the media and the excitement arising out of the indo-pak relationship
 jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne vaarta kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki media kii chakachaundh se dur rahakar baatcheet karne se 'maun pragati' ho sakati he

 Surjewala said, 'moreover, it raises genuine concerns whether it is not an attempt to divert the attention of the country from the current political and economic challenges as well as the widespread agrarian crisis

 Virat Kohli is very angry
 kabhi saathi khilaadiyon to kabhi cricket kit par apana gussa nikaalata he
 There is no lag in getting involved with opponents
 edilade test main bhartiya team kii captaini kar rahe viraat ne jab apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi to har kisi ke man main unhen lekar yahi avadharanaen thim
 Kohli's attitude also contributed to this
 par dhire-dhire chijen badal rahi hai
 Viratko is still angry today
 use agar kuch bura laga to munh par hi jawaab de detaa he
 But he gives the most concrete answer with his bat
 wo bhi aise andaaj main ki aalochak bilkul chup ho jaaen
 Something similar happened on the third day of the Adelaide Test
 england ke sharmnaak ke daure ke baad test main viraat kohli kii ballebaaji par sawaal uthne lage the
 Cricket experts said that now it will not be easy for Kohli to score runs
 unki takanic main jo badi khami thi vah ujagar ho chuki he
 In Australia, bowlers like Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Ryan Harris will long for one run
 par anumaanon se thik ulat kohli ne sabaki bolti band kar di
 When Australia declared the innings at 517, there was a moment that Indian batsmen might not kneel once again
 par viraat ne kuch or hi tay kar rakhaa tha
 As a result, Virat Kohli hit a century
 kohli ne bhartiya pari ke 85wein over kii duusari gend par jaise hi midwicket boundry kii ore chaukaa jadaa, unki khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 Kohli celebrated this combative innings in his familiar style
 shatak puraa karne ke liye unhone 158 gendon kaa saamana kiya
 The only regret is that Kohli became the victim of Mitchell Johnson on the score of 115 runs
 lekin unhone wo neenv rakh di jisaki bhartiya team ko jarurat thi
 This innings of Virat Kohli is important in many ways
 
 
 jubaan nahin, gend or balle se do javabjab viraat kohli england main lagaataar flop ho rahe the to unki jamkar aalochana kii ja rahi thi
 Everyone was questioning his attitude and technique
 media aksar unke or anoushka sharma ke rishte ke bare main puuchhati
 Some even blamed his relationship for his poor form
 par viraat chup rahe
 Silently focused on his game and technique
 jarurat padi to sachin tendulkar kii sharan main bhi pahunch gaye
 But the media did not answer any question which was not related to his game
 or edilade main shatak jadkar maano unhone apane upar uth rahe har sawaal kaa jawaab bina kuch bole de diya
 The way he celebrated this century, as if he was saying
 
 
 mil gaya jawaab
 Pay attention to my game from now on
 vanade se paaya foroxsar tivi comentary main aapane suna hoga ki vanade or test do alag-alag formet hai
 The method of batting is different
 newjiland ke purv cricketer martin kro ne to viraat ke bare main yahaan tak likh diya tha ki vah vanade ke jabardast khilaadi hai, lekin test ko lekar sanshay he
 Now call it a coincidence that Kohli, who is running out of form in England, has returned to form only on the basis of ODI cricket
 isi saal westeindies ke khilaaf dilli vanade match ke baad maano kohli ne peeche mudakar hi nahin dekha
 In the last six innings of odis, Kohli's score card has been something like this
 
 
 127, 22, 49, 53, 66 or naabad 139
 Two half-century innings in warm-up matches in Australia
 kohli ne jo ek baar ran bananaa shuru kiya, peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Poor form of some time and Class Permanent Form Is Temporary But Class Is Permanent, this is often used in cricket
 kohli england daure se pehle ranon kaa ambara laga rahe the, par jaisaa har cricketer ke saath hota he unka bhi bura daur aayaa
 The technique betrayed that his performance dropped from match to match
 par jiske khel main class ho wo kabhi na kabhi to vaapasi karegaa hi, kohli ne yahi sabit kar dikhaaya
 Started in odis and continue in Adelaide
 ummid yahi he ki aane vaale dinon main bhi dhamal jari rahegaa
 The most important thing of this innings of Jorkohali on the partnership was that he shared 81 with Cheteshwar Pujara for the third wicket and 101 runs with Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth wicket
 paanchaven wicket ke liye rohit sharma ke saath 74 ran jode
 Even though Team India is far away from Australia's score, but Kohli's strategy has brought India closer to his score
 captain ho to aage se khelocaptain kaa kaam sirf press conference karnaa nahin hota
 His role is not limited to the selection of playing XI, deciding the bowling order on the field or the fielding
 vah ek cricketer ke taur par team kaa hissaa he
 That is, he also has to perform with bat or ball
 captain hone ke naate jimmedaari bhi zyada hogi
 That is, to set an example for others
 jab bhartiya team australia daure ke liye ravaanaa ho rahi thi to unhone kaha tha ki ham unke akraman kaa jawaab apni akramakata se denge
 Kohli showed all this through his performance
 captaini pari khelkar team ke khilaadiyon kaa bhi manobal badhaayaa or saathi ballebaaj ko ishaaron main ishaaron main kaha diya, aap aapaki baari

 It is clear from this that the private sector has a market share of 80 per cent, 60 per cent of the beds, 60 per cent of the admitted patients, 80 per cent of the outpatients and 80 per cent of the doctors in the delivery of secondary, top-class care services
 Huh
 universal swasthya kawarej ke agenda ko puraa karne kii kshamta or sansaadhan na to sarkaar or na hi nijee kshetra ke paas hai
 In such a situation, it is commendable to recognize the development of the private sector with the government's goals in NHP 2017
 donon ke bich dirghakaalik saajhedaari hi upaay he
 Now that the government is going to convert this policy into an implementation framework, the following points are necessary for effective partnership: Develop effective PPP models for private sector participation in government schemes

 The financial health of private service providers is not very good
 mahanagaron or duusari shrenee ke shaharon main bhi aspataal maamuli pieti (profit akrator tex) margin hasil kar rahe hai or aarosii (ritern on capital aplid) puunji kii laagat se kam he
 It is important to understand this holistically; create an independent body like the Monitor (NHS), UK, to develop a framework to assess the financial health of both public and private providers, an acceptable return for private providers
 It may be possible to set rates based on actual costs for the purchase of public private materials and to monitor the suitability of health outcomes
 To make; rules for private sector participation in medical education to be liberalized, which attract investment; create a punitive system to prevent illegal practice with mutual cooperation of industry and government; NHP misses focus on protecting medical professionals Gaya, which is the most important part of this region

 viraat kohli kaa jaadu na to ab tak ipel toornament main chalaa or na hi kisi global cricket toornament main
 Even in the IPL, Kohli has so far failed to make Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) the champion and now in tournaments like the World Cup, he is not taking the name of the chokers
 maujuuda daur main duniya ke sarvshereshth khilaadiyon main shumaar kohli ko ballebaaj ke taur par hi nahin, captain ke taur par apni shreshthata sabit karne ke liye bada mauka tha
 But he was dismissed by scoring just 1 run in the semi-final match against New Zealand
 viraat kohli kii baat karen to vah world cap 2015 semifinal match main bhi australia ke khilaaf ek ran banaakar out hue the
 This is not the first time Virat Kohli has flopped in a knockout match of the World Cup

 In that match, he was caught by Umar Akmal off the pace bowler Wahab Riaz

 kohli ke paas kapil dev or mahendra singh dhoni ke club main shaamil hone kaa mauka tha
 In 1983, Kapil Dev won the World Cup for India for the first time
 uske thik 28 saal baad mahendra singh dhoni ne bharat ko 2011 kaa world champion banaaya
 But after 8 years, Virat Kohli could not win the third World Cup title to India
 2017 main kohli ne england main khele gaye mini world cap yani champions trophy main bharat ko toornament ke final tak pahunchaaya tha
 But, this time the fans hoped that Kohli, who made India the Champions Trophy 2017 runners-up, would win the World Cup to the Indian team this time

 iske saath hi ab raajnneetik halkon main is baat par charchaa garma gai he ki pradesh main maujuuda shibu sorain kii sarkaar kaa bhavishya kya hoga
 In the matter of division of votes on the proposal of deduction in Parliament, it is understood that the UPA Government has shown Shibu Soren in fear of serious cases going against him kuch jaankaron kaa aisa bhi maananaa he ki shibu sorain pradesh main bijepi netaaon ke gairajaruri hastkshep se naakhush the, isi vajah se unhone ek baar phir upie kaa daaman tham liya
 Now a situation can be created such that JMM, along with Jharkhand Vikas Morcha and Congress, form a new government in the state
 yah bhi mumkin he ki upie shibu sorain ko centre main jagah de or shibu ke putr hemanth sorain ko upmukhyamantri kaa pad de diya jaae
 Then the Congress can retain the Chief Minister's chair
 duusari sthiti main shibu sorain pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane rah sakate hai or jhavimo sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan kar saktaa he
 However, no party other than BJP has opened its cards
 vaise raajnneeti main kuch bhi naammumkin nahin he
 The market is still hot for various speculations on the latest strategy

 After the bjp's withdrawal of support from the jmm-led government, the small parties that played a key role in forming the government in Jharkhand are preferring the 'wait and see' policy

" ’’ jharkhand vikaas morcha (prajatantric) ke mahasachiv pradeep yadav ne kaha, ‘‘ham kal is maamle par vichaar karenge or koi nirnay lenge
 However, after voting in the Lok Sabha to protest against the cut motion against the government, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha clarified that voting in favor of the government was done by mistake and there is no plan to form a government in Jharkhand with the Congress

 purv captain rahul dravid ne viraat kohli kii prashansa karte hue unhen maujuuda form main ‘sarvshereshth bhartiya ballebaaj’ qaraar kiya
 He said that playing a key role in winning the second Test against New Zealand under pressure, will boost his confidence significantly
 dravid mehmaan camentator ke rup main camentry baks main pahunche the
 He said, 'virat is a great batsman
 maujuuda form main vah bhartiya team main sarvshereshth ballebaaj he
 He has really taken full advantage of the opportunities
 ’kohli ne captain mahendra singh dhoni ke saath milakar bhartiya team ko lakshya hasil karne main safalataa dilaayi
 Dravid said that the experience of leading the team to victory in the fourth innings would boost his confidence
 unhone kaha, ‘viraat ke paas salaah ke liye dhoni the, lekin is lakshya ko hasil karne se nishchit rup se uske aatmavishvaas main ijapha hoga
 'virat was called the freelance cricketer early in his career and Dravid feels that this batsman has improved a lot
 dravid ne kaha, ‘maine under 19 ke dinon se uskaa kariyar dekha he
 He was part of the Royal Challengers Bangalore, i have seen him up close
 uski pratibha par kabhi sawaal nahin uthaa tha lekin maansik anushaasan sambandhi kuch mudde the
 The veteran, who has played 164 Tests for India, said, "but i am happy that he has learned from mistakes and has improved a lot as a batsman
" shuru main use short pich gendon se kuch pareshaani thi lekin ab usamen kaaphi sudhaar ho gaya he
 Dravid said Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane and Manoj Tiwari have the ability to make it to the Test team
 unhone kaha, ‘rahane kaaphi pratibhashali ballebaaj he
 Some years with Mumbai Indians were tough as his batting line-up was very strong
 lekin vah royles main aayaa or use bakhubi pataa tha ki use mauka milegaa or usne un maukon kaa puraa phayda uthaaya
 Dravid said, "ultimately playing time is important for young players
 dressing room main anya khilaadiyon ke saath aap kuch chijen sikh sakate ho lekin aap badi chijen krij par rahakar hi sikhte ho
 Dravid, however, does not support a series of bilateral one-day internationals and does not see any benefit from this
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki teenon praaroop astitv main rah sakate hai
 But i would like that odis should be limited to ICC tournaments like World Cup and Champions Trophy only
 twanti20 cricket ko kaaphi lokapriyata mil rahi he
 But i do not see any benefit in having a series of bilateral one-day internationals of five or seven matches
 ’dravid ne kaha, ‘lekin test maichon ke liye itani sankhya main darshakon ko dekhnaa acha laga
 This indicates that Test cricket is still preferred
 ’ Under the leadership of Virat Kohli, Team India started their campaign on Wednesday with a match against South Africa in the World Cup
 team india ke form ko dekhte hue har kisi kii jubaan par he ki kya kohli apni captaini main vaisaa hi itihaas doharaa paaenge jo ki kapil dev ne 1983 or mahendra singh dhoni ne 2011 main kar dikhaaya tha
 In 1983, India defeated the West Indies in the final and Sri Lanka in 2011 and took the cup
 2019 main england main khele ja rahe maujuuda world cap main bhi bharat ko khitaab kaa tagada daavedaar mana ja rahaa he
 The 15-member team India is believed to be a better combination of experience and young talent
 india today group ke data intelegence unit (DIU) ne bharat ke khilaadiyon ke pehle ke pradarshan ko khangaalane ke baad pahchaanane kii koshish kii- is world cap main koun koun se khilaadi ahm sabit honge
 DIU analyzed India's batting line-up on two scales
 > wo kitni tezi se ran score (strike rate) karte hai?> ausatan wo kitna score banaate hai?bharat kii batting kii dhuree captain kohli ke irdagird gumti he, maujuuda team main kohli ke naam sabase zyada ran darj hai
 Kohli has scored 41 centuries in ODI cricket so far
 naa sirf wo lambii paariyaan khelte hai balki 93 kii strike rate ke saath team india ke score kii gati bhi badhaate rahe hai
 Apart from Kohli, two more batsmen are also very important for Team India
 top order main rohit sharma or loar middle order main mahendra singh dhoni
 Both Rohit and Dhoni have played the role of handling one end with scoring
 rohit pari kii shuruyaat main zarur satark rahete hai lekin jab unki nigahen jam jaati hai to lambii pari khelte hai
 Not surprisingly, Rohit has the highest number of double centuries in ODI cricket
 yaheen nahin rohit ke naam vanade cricket main 264 ran kii sabase badi pari khilne kaa bhi record he
 As far as former India captain Dhoni is concerned, he is considered as one of the most influential players of all time as a finisher
 maujuuda team main dhoni sabase zyada anbhavi hai
 Dhoni is known for adapting his game to suit the situation
 dhoni ne apane kariyar main 341 vanade cricket maichon main 10 shatak or 71 ardhshtak jade hai
 Talking about young talent, Team India has an explosive all-rounder like Hardik Pandya, Hardik, identified as a hitter, has a strike rate of 117
 hardik apane balle se kai baar team india ke liye tej score kar apana loha manavaa chuke hai
 The performance of India's batting line-up so far, when it comes to Team India's bowling department, looks quite sharp this time
 pes bowling main jasprit bumraah par sab kii nigahen rahengi to unka saath dene ke liye bhubaneshwar kumaar or mohammad shami jaise ghaatak bowlar bhi maujuud hai
 Firki's responsibility is on the shoulders of Yajuvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav
 inke alaava alrounder ravindra jadeja bhi phiraki main apana kamaal dikhaate rahe hai
 Hardik Pandya's medium fast bowling can also prove to be effective in English conditions to support pace bowlers
 agar bolors ke purv pradarshan kaa vishleshan kiya jaae to bharat ke liye is baar bumraah ke alaava chahal or yadav bhi ahm sabit ho sakate hai
 Bumrah has emerged as the best bowler in Slog Overs with his antidote Yorkers
 bumraah 49 vanade maichon main 85 wicket le chuke hai
 Another feature of Bumrah is skipping runs in Boling
 unka bowling ausat prati wicket 22 ran he
 Bumrah's career economy rate 4
 5 ran prati over he
 Chahal and leg-spinner Yadav, known for Chinaman in ODI cricket, are also quite good with 25 runs per wicket
 inkaa iconomi rate bhi kifayati he
 It will be interesting to see how they do fluent bowling in English condition suitable for pace bowling
 bharat ke teen pes bolors main mohammad shami kaa bowling everej 26 ran prati wicket kaa he
 Their economy rate is 5
 5 prati over he
 If Shami keeps more control over his economy rate, then Bumrah can prove to be a good partner
 bharat ke bolors kaa ab tak kaa pradarshan Solanki said, "the Prime Minister spoke eloquently about coworkers, but we did not tell us that he himself encouraged coworkers to do such work while he was the Chief Minister

 or rohit ne tod daale itane saare recordvanade cricket main kisi bhi ballebaaj ke liye dabl centuri jadna sapane jaisaa hota he, or rohit duniya ke ekmaatr aise ballebaaj ban gaye hai jinhone vanade international main do dohare shatak jad daale hai
 Apart from this, Rohit has also left behind Virender Sehwag's world record of 219 in terms of individual score
 rohit ne srilankai gendbaajon kii berahami se pitayee karte hue 225 minute kii marathon pari ke dauraan 173 gend par 33 chauke or 9 chhakkon kii madad se 264 ranon kii jaadui pari kheli
 Rohit's score was so much that even the entire Sri Lankan team could not score so many runs together
 rohit ne ek or record apane naam kar liya he
 Rohit has overtaken Australian batsman Shane Watson in the matter of scoring from the boundaries
 rohit ne 264 main se 186 ran (33 chauke, 9 chakke) to boundrij se batore
 Earlier, Watson scored 150 runs (15 fours, 15 sixes) from the boundaries in the innings of 185 runs against Bangladesh
 ungali main fracture ke chalate rohit ko england daure ko bich main chhodkar aana padaa
 After that, after recovering from injury, he scored a century in a practice match against Sri Lanka, and indicated his return to form
 rohit jab ballebaaji karne aae the to shuruyaat kaaphi dhimi rahi thi
 How Rohit Sharma accelerated his innings over time can be gauged from the fact that he completed his half-century off 72 balls while it took him 100 balls to reach the century
 125 gend par unhone 150 ran puure kiye to 151 gend par dabl centuri thok daali
 He faced 166 balls to reach 250 runs
 vanade kii chaar 'chamatkaari' dabl centuri hamaari hi jholii menek or mjedaar baat ye he ki vanade international main abhitak mahaj chaar baar koi ballebaaj doharaa shatak laga paaya he
 And all four times this feat has been done by the batsmen of Team India
 sachin tendulkar vanade cricket main doharaa shatak jadne vaale pehle ballebaaj bane, to unke shagird kahe jane vaale virendra sahvaag ne westeindies ke khilaaf 219 ranon kii aatishi pari kheli thi
 After that Rohit Sharma hit 209 runs against Australia last year, while the second double century took root against Sri Lankan team
 cricket ke 'bhagwaan' kaa rohit par bharosaschin tendulkar ko cricket kaa bhagwaan kaha jaataa he, or is bhagwaan ne apane sanyas ke baad kaha tha ki viraat kohli or rohit sharma unke records tod sakate hai
 Tendulkar would not have said it without thinking and Rohit Sharma's innings has proved that Tendulkar's confidence will not be lost
 world cap main turup kaa ikkaa honge rohitarohit sharma ke liye team india ke kaaryvahak captain viraat kohli ne is match se pehle kaha tha ki wo world cap main team india ke liye turup kaa ikkaa sabit honge
 Now seeing Rohit's innings, there is hardly any doubt in anyone's mind
 2015 world cap australia or newjiland kii mejabani main hona he or donon hi deshon main rohit kaa record bayaan karata he ki aakhir kyon viraat ne unke liye aisa kaha
 a good record in New Zealand and Australia, he has scored 188 runs in 7 odis in New Zealand without being once out
 is dauraan unka ausat 37
 He was 60 and had a half-century off his bat
 baat agar australia kii karen to yahaan to rohit kaa record utana acha nahin he
 Rohit has scored 314 runs in 15 matches on Australian soil
 is dauraan wo teen baar noteout rahe or unka ausat 26
 Has been 16
 rohit ne australia main abhi tak koi centuri nahin jadi he, jisaki bharpai wo australia-england ke saath hone vaali tri siries main or world cap main karnaa chahenge
