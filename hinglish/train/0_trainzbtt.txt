 Nawazuddin has given many statements on important issues like apartheid
 ab ek nae intervyuu main navazuddin kaa kahana he ki bollywood hi nahin hamaara samaaj bhi rang ke aadhaar par banta hua he
 In an interview to Hindustan Times, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said - "not only in the film industry, the taboo of apartheid is spread everywhere in the society
 chijen itani jaldi nahin badalane vaali he
 It is, and always will be, uncontrolled in Bollywood
 vaise aam janata bhi apni heroin ko gori or hero ko gora dekhnaa chaahati he
 "nawazuddin said-" The mother also wants the son to bring a white daughter-in-law
 isliye ye to samaaj kaa hissaa he
 This mentality is also reflected in Bollywood
 ek bada badlaav jaruri he
 The issue of apartheid in Bollywood was hot when casting director Sanjay Chauhan of the film Babumoshay Gunbaaz made a controversial statement
 unhone kaha tha ki ye ajeeb dikhataa agar navazuddin ko gore or handsam actors ke saath cast kiya jaataa
 Thank u 4 making me realize dat i cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz I'm dark & not good looking, but i never focus on that
 — Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@nawazuddin_s)july 17, 2017iske jawaab main navazuddin ne kaha tha- ''shukriya mujhe ye bataane ke liye ki main gore or handsam logon ke saath cast nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Because my color is dark and i don't look good
 lekin maine kabhi is cheez par focus nahin kiya
 Then the fans supported Nawazuddin

 2015-16 ke aankadon kii maane to bihar kii jelon main band kaidiyon ko sabase zyada dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he
 The Bihar government spends an average of Rs 83,691 a year on a prisoner, while the Rajasthan government spends just three thousand rupees annually
 punjab main ye aankada 16,669 rupee he, jabaki nagaland main 65,468 rupee salanaa prati kaidi
 These figures are enough to surprise anyone
 supreme court ne bhi in par achraj jataayaa he
 Surprised by the different expenses in this item in different states, the Supreme Court is now preparing to conduct an audit of all jails with the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
 court ne kendriya grih mantralay se 31 march tak yojana maangi he ki kis tareeke se jelon ke kharch kaa audit kar pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ye paisa sooyeeboojh se kharch kiya ja rahaa he yaa nahin or kaidiyon ko iskaa laabh mil bhi rahaa he yaa nahin
 The comments iske saath hi supreme court ne jelon main staff par kami par bhi chintaa jataate hue centre sarkaar or sabhi rajyon or centreshasit pradeshon ko 31 march tak gelkarmiyon kii bhartee ke kadam uthaane ko kaha he
 In fact, in the Supreme Court, Amix Currie cited the 2014 Lok Sabha reply stating that as on 31 December 2014, the posts of 79,988 jail personnel were approved in the country, while only 52,666 jail personnel are working
 yani jelon main 27 hajaar karmiyon ke pad khaali hai
 At the same time, the Supreme Court has also raised big questions on the training of jail personnel
 report ke mutabik 50 hajaar se zyada jail karmiyon main se sirf 7800 ko hi kisi tarah kii training di gai
 The Supreme Court has directed the central government to talk to the state governments by March 31 and prepare a manual for training for jail staff
 supreme court ne ye bhi saaf kiya he ki rajya sarkaron or centreshasit pradeshon ko is maamle me centre kaa sahyog karnaa hoga
 If this does not happen then heavy fines will be imposed
 ab supreme court maamle kii sunwaayee 12 april ko karegaa
 In fact, in 2013, former Chief Justice RC Lahoti wrote a letter to the then CGI on the situation of inmates of Tamil Nadu jail
 supreme court is par sangyaan lekar sunwaayee kar chukaa he
 Even before this, the court has issued several guidelines

 vahiin supreme court ne gelkarmiyon kii training par bhi bade sawaal uthaae hai
 According to the report, out of more than 50,000 jail personnel, only 7800 were given any kind of training
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko nirdesh die hai ki wo 31 march tak rajya sarkaron se baat kar gelkarmiyon ke liye training kaa koi manual taiyaar kare
 The Supreme Court has also made it clear that state governments and union territories will have to cooperate with the Center in this matter
 agar aisa nahin hua to baari jurmaana lagaaya jayega
 Now the Supreme Court will hear the case on April 12

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par apane kanoon mantri somnath bharti ko hataane kaa dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 Kejriwal met Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung regarding the matter, but after the meeting, he left without saying anything to the media
 haalanki kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ne kaha, yah ek routine mulaakaat thi, jo har hafte hoti he or iskaa somnath maamle se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The Congress MLA from Delhi also went to meet the Deputy Governor today in connection with the misconduct allegedly committed by Somnath Bharti with Ugandan women
 somnath bharti par aarope he ki unhone apane kuch samarthakon ke saath rajdhani ke khidki ekstansion ilaake main rahane vaali uganda kii ladakiyon par nasli tippanee kii or un par drugs or sex racket main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 In this case, there was a lot of tension between Bharti and Delhi Police over the raid, about which Kejriwal sat on a dharna
 uganda kii mahilaon ne unke khilaaf adaalat main bhi shikaayat kii he or mahila ayog main bhi
 According to the Women's Commission, the charges against Somnath Bharti, if proved, could lead to a sentence of up to three years

 The bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and his father Farooq Abdullah continue their war of words
 faruk or umr ne narendra modi par tikhaa prahaar karte hue kaha ki modi kaa iraadaa samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ko nirast karnaa he, jisamen jammu or kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya gaya he
 He emphasized that the people of the state will never accept it
 umr ne srinagar main kaha, 'modi sahab, aapke paas kashmir main aakar vot maangane kaa saahas nahin he
 You have come out to become the Prime Minister of the country, but you will not come to Kashmir to ask for votes
 ' unhone kaha, 'aap jammu or ladakh jaaenge, lekin ghati nahin jaaenge, kyonki is sthaan ke bare main aapaki ek raay he or jis tarah se aapane logon ko badnaam kiya he
 i don't think there is any place for them in your heart
 ' Omar wrote on Twitter, 'modi is forgetting that Sheikh Abdullah chose secular India instead of Muslim Pakistan and then spent two decades in captivity but never bowed down
 ' mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bijepi sirf raajnneetik phaayde ke liye kashmiri panditon ke dard kaa istemaal karti he or jammu main ek chunavi raily main modi kaa bhaashan iskaa saboot he
 Omar said that Modi's statement on the issue of Kashmiri Pandits leaving Kashmir is disrespectful to the Kashmiri people
 mukhyamantri ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, 'jab kashmiri panditon ne ghati chodi us vakt jagmohan rajyapal ke taur par rajya kaa shashan sambhaal rahe the or faruk sahab satta main nahin the
 As far as i know, Jagmohan has still not broken his ties with BJP
 ' Omar told reporters, "jagmohan was appointed as the governor by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed (who is currently the PDP mentor), home minister in the VP Singh cabinet
 veepi singh bijepi ke samarthan se sarkaar chalaa rahe the
 
 
 i hope the BJP leaders remember this
 ' Omar said, 'most Kashmiri Muslims are saddened by the incident of expulsion of Kashmiri Pandits and they want to bring them back
 Modi has offended the Kashmiri people with this statement
 ' It is worth noting that while retaliating on the statement of Farooq Abdullah, Modi today said that the policies of Sheikh Abdullah, Farooq and his son Omar were responsible for the communalization of state politics and the expulsion of Kashmiri Pandits on the basis of religion
 (padhein- modi kaa faruk par palatwaar) Earlier, Farooq Abdullah, the head of Kashmir's ruling National Conference Party, had said on Sunday that Modi's supporters should die in the sea
 (padhein) Asked if he supports Farooq's statement, Omar said his statement was in reference to a remark by a BJP leader that said Modi's opponents would have to go to Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'is par faisla chunaav ayog ko karnaa he
 ' ek sawaal ke jawaab main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki unke pita kii is tippanee main kuch bhi galat nahin he ki kashmir sampradayik bharat kaa hissaa nahin hoga
 Omar said, 'he (farooq) is not stupid
 unhone yah nahin kaha ki agar modi pradhanmantri banate hai to kashmir bharat kaa hissaa nahin hoga
 He said that Kashmir will not be a part of communal India and i do not see anything wrong in it
 ' After the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, under the ongoing tension with Pakistan, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh has said in Pokhran that our nuclear policy 'no First Use' today, but what will happen next will tell the situation

 What will happen in the future will depend on the circumstances
 ' rakshaamantri rajnath singh ne pokharan main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko unki pehali punyatithi par shradhanjali bhi di
 Singh said, 'it is a coincidence that today i came to Jaisalmer for International Army Scout Competition and today is the first death anniversary of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 isliye, mujhe laga ki mujhe pokharan kii dharti par hi unhen shradhanjali deni chahie
 'let me tell you, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, nuclear testing was done in Pokhran in May 1998

 “himmat he to vahaan notebandi or jiesti ke phaayde bataaen
 Talk about inflation and say that Dalits and backward classes are happy there

 Lashing out at Prime Minister Modi, Lalu further said that the Central Government should soon enact a law in Parliament which provides that any person can enter the temple only if the grandfather was built by his maternal grandfather

 zaayra ne 2017 main aamir khan productions kii film sikret superstar ke pramotion kaarykram ke dauraan india today se baatcheet main yah kissa saajha kiya tha
 He had told that people in Kashmir are happy with their work and ask them to continue acting
 lekin do saal baad, zaayra kaa man badal gaya he
 Zaira wrote to her social media accounts on saying goodbye to Bollywood so soon, "I got a lot of love, support and appreciation of the people while working in this light, but it also took me towards the ship because i inadvertently believed (faith) lost its way
 main lagaataar aise maahaul main kaam kar rahi thi jo mere imaan ke aade aa rahaa tha or majahab se mere rishte par khatra mandaraane laga tha

 Zaira has said that she should be kept away from promoting this film
 aksar patharbaji kii vaardaat ke kaaran surkhiyon main rahane vaale srinagar ke hawaal ilaake main pali-badi zaayra kabhi filmon kii shaukeen nahin rahi
 In 2017, he confessed with great clarity, "all the movies i have watched have been watched in little by little
" 
 
 ek bhi film shuru se ant tak nahin dekhi
 '' Sabka was just a coincidence with acting
 unhone khud ko kabhi kamjor nahin mana lekin yah bhi kabuula ki ek tarah kii 'saamaajik bechaini' ke saath ve badi huin
 In an Instagram post in 2018, he wrote about his struggle in frustration, "feeling emptiness, uneasiness
" 
 
 '' or ''dimag jaise sunn pad gaya he or khudakushi ke vichaar aate hai
 In the end, he also wrote that he had overcome the fear of what a solution would be

 Then the valley was very turbulent after Burhan Wani was killed
 apane sevanivrutt banker pita zaahid ke bare main zaayra kahati hai, ''unhen meri kaaphi phikr rahati he
 They don't tolerate anything wrong about me
 '' zaahid hi aamir khan se baat karne mumbai pahunche the or unase bharosa maanga tha ki vah unki sohabat main puri tarah mahfuj rahegi
 Zaira said, "the moment they met Aamir Khan, everything went well
 ''aamir khan ko zaayra main aise star kii jhalak dikhi thi jiskaa bhavishya ujjwal he
 He told India Today TV in 2017, "I think he is one of the best actors in our industry today
 jab main apni pehali yaa duusari filmon ko palatakar dekhtaa hum to mujhe lagata he ki main to acting main unke aasapaas bhi kahin nahin tha
 It is amazing that talent from every part of the country is coming into the film industry
 ''apni donon filmon main zaayra ne apni adaakaari se aaj kii ladakiyon kii aakankshaon, gusse or josh ko bahut khubasurat tareeke se parade par utaara tha
 "she is very honest in front of the camera," says casting director Mukesh Chhabra, whose assistant found him in Srinagar during his search for talent

 ho saktaa he, ve unhen maujuuda daur main bhi mil jaaen yaa phir itihaas main milen

 unki ek dost jo unke is faisle se hairaan nahin hai, kahati hai, ''kashmir main mashhoor logon ke liye saamaajik bandishen doguni ho jaati hai lekin ve sahaj bani raheen
 The film fraternity has given mixed reactions to Zaira's decision
 kuch ne unki is 'vyaktigat pasand' kaa sammaan kiya he jabaki bahuton ko majahab kenam par apane faisle ko sahi tehraane kii unki koshish par aapatti he
 In a tweet that was later removed, Raveena Tandon wrote, "the gratitude of the one who has done only two films so far and who got so much from the industry, does not matter much
" behatar hota ki ve or shaleenta kaa parichay dete hue film industry ko alavida kahatee or apane pratigaami vichaaron ko khud tak rakhti
 Dangal director Nitesh Tiwari said, "it was unexpected, but this is his life
" hamamen se kisi ko bhi unke nijee faisle par tippanee karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Zaira's decision in Kashmir was also welcomed by those who trolled him when he met Mehbooba Mufti two years ago
 unke samarthan main actor mir sarwar bhi saamne aae, jo ashutosh goarikar kii agali film main dikhenge
 Very few people will know what Zaira wants to do next

 She would probably feel relieved to see the beautiful hills in her house with her three cats

 It seems too long and cumbersome when you are struggling with yourself
 '' zaayra ab shaayad khud ko aaazaad mahasoos kar rahi hongi
 "the journey was very tiring

 In such a situation, it is important that some basic things are also remembered
 isi kram main pesh hai chunaav se judi kuch choti-choti, lekin moti baaten
 1
 ham kitne kunthit hai
 This is evidenced by the behavior of Nagma in Meerut every day
 2
 Until the ads of inverters and water purifiers arrive in this country, it is good if the leader does not talk about going to Mars-forest
 3
 It is good to be cool and cool
 magar iskaa matlab ye nahin ki deth bed par padi maa teen-teen patiyon kii tasviir dikhaae or bachche se kahe ki pataa nahin tera baap koun he or betaa phir bhi ipel ke liye bhaag jaae
 4
 jaise trephic chaalaan katane par diel main chhed kar diya jaataa he
 Similarly, those who change parties should be stained before the election
 taaki dur se pataa chale ki ye kis kism ke daagi hai
 5
 or netaa ji, ab vichaardhaara kii ladaai ke naam par janata ko bananaa band karo
 Because no ideology stops development
 na bahusankhyak kaa or na alpsankhyak kaa
 6
 tamaam maulavee sarkari kharch par haj or pandit chaar dham yatra par bhej die jaaen
 By sticking tape in the mouth
 jo batch jaaen or fatwa jari karen unase poocha jaae ki daan peti or jakaat ke maal kaa hisaab kya he
 Where did the Waqf and Ashram land come from and how was it used till now
 7
 Carefully stop speaking of all the celebrities of the country
 kisi party kaa saport karte hai to khulkar saamne aaen
 If you do not labor over the crocodile
 kisi raajnneetik dal yaa vichaardhaara kaa samarthak hone bhar se hi aap achche yaa bure insaan nahin ho jate
 8
 apane bacchon ko in chunaavon ke tamaam rang or khabaren jarur dikhaaen
 They should know that the society of which they are repeated, how vulgar they have become during their most urgent work
 bachche dekhen or seekhen or ho sake to hamen bhi sikhaaen ki chijen itani khunriji nahin hai
 9
 aap kisi bhi party ke hon
 You can only reveal your cheapness by whatsapping a morphed picture of Sonia Gandhi or Mayawati or Meenakshi Lekhi or Shazia Ilmi
 isliye apni kalakaari kisi monaalisa ko banane main lagaaein or gender-younangon se aage badhen
 Talk about politics if mind is instead of heart and mind instead of heart
 10
 And the most important thing
 garmi abhi zyada nahin he
 So do not use your mouth to make yogurt
 jo lag rahaa he, use bol den
 Will be light
 vaise bhi puraa desh ajab kabj kaa shikaar he
 Therefore, it is important to be mentally pharaoh

 phir bhi skool kii diwaar main ek notice laga he
 On which this written sentence surprises everyone
 sagar jile ke ek gaanv main sarkari praathmik skool kaa haal behaal he

 The principal said that he has laid a fan and a pipeline from a nearby well in the village to the school at his expense

 The headmaster said that the premises are open due to broken walls

 For this reason, one of the students who was not coming, told ANI that we do not have drinking water or electricity facilities
 is vajah se chaatro ne skool aana shuru nahin kiya he
 But what is interesting about this school is that it is written in the notice hung on the wall of the school that you are under CCTV surveillance

 purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko diya bharat ratna sammaan waapas lene sambandhi vivaadit prastaav kaa party netritv dwaara samarthan nahin kiye jane par aap vidhayak alka lamba ne shanivaar ko khushi jaahir kii he
 Lamba had on Friday refused to endorse the disputed proposal presented by AAP MLA Jarnail Singh in the Delhi Assembly, even resigning from the Assembly membership
 isse upje vivaad ko shant karte hue aap ke varisht netaa or dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki sammaan vaapasi se jude kisi prastaav kaa party samarthan nahin karti he
 Sisodia also denied that the party leadership had demanded Lamba's resignation, stating that neither resignation was sought nor did he resign
 vahiin, lamba ne bhi istipha dene kii baat se inkaar kar diya
 After Sisodia's statement, Lamba tweeted, "I feel very happy that the party has supported the Bharat Ratna given to the late Rajiv Gandhi
 rajeev gandhi ke athulaneey balidaan or tyaag ko yah desh kabhi nahin bhula saktaa he
 He also removed the proposal from Twitter, which led to the controversy
 lamba ne kaha, 'main us prastaav kii prati ko hataa rahi hum, jo vidhansabha main paarit hi nahin hua
 'it is noteworthy that Lamba had expressed her displeasure in the matter on Friday, saying that AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal has asked her to resign as MLA and she will resign after accepting the decision of the party chief
 sisodiya ne bataaya ki 1984 ke sikh virdohi danga peediton ko nyaay dilaane ke liye vidhansabha main pichley do dinon se chal rahi charchaa ke dauraan paarit ek prastaav ko lekar yah vivaad paidaa hua tha
 He clarified that the original resolution passed from the House did not include the withdrawal of the Bharat Ratna
 prastaav paarit kiye jane ke samay sadan main maujuud rahe aap ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne bataaya ki party vidhayak jaranel singh ko danga peediton ko nyaay dilaane sambandhi prastaav pesh karnaa tha
 At the same time, AAP MLA Somnath Bharti wrote a letter seeking withdrawal of Bharat Ratna of Rajiv Gandhi on the copy of the proposal distributed to the mlas and gave the said copy to Jarnail Singh for presentation on the floor of the House
 bharadwaj ne kaha mul prastaav hi sadan se paarit hua jisamen purv pradhanmantri se judi maang kaa zikr nahin tha
 He admitted that the demand to return the Bharat Ratna could be considered part of the amended resolution, which was not passed
 rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna sammaan waapas lene kii maang se ittefaq rakhane ke sawaal par sisodiya ne kaha, 'hamaara aisa koi vichaar nahin he ki rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna sammaan waapas liya jaae
 Stating this confusion as the reason for the dispute, he said that the dispute has ended as soon as it is resolved
 sisodiya ne lamba se istipha maange jane or unke istife kii peshkash kii atakalon ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 It is noteworthy that Lamba had said that Rajiv Gandhi had sacrificed for the country
 ise bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 Therefore, she does not support the proposal to withdraw the Bharat Ratna award given to her
 mahendra singh dhoni ne test cricket se sanyas kya liya, lag rahaa he maano unhone sarvasv daan kar diya
 The anger at the defeat of the Test series in Australia has suddenly turned into sympathy for him
 deshbhar ke bhol-bhaale cricket premi yaad kar rahe hai ki unhone apane kareer main kya-kya ullekhneey kiya
 Why is this happening? Dhoni was handed the captaincy of the Indian Test team
 use oonchai par pahunchaana to unka kaam hi tha
 The team also supported
 kuch us tevar ne bhi to kamaal dikhaaya, jo saurav ganguli bhartiya team ko gurumantra kii tarah de gaye the
 Now come, understand from the action replay of Dhoni and decide how great a captain he is
 ve isisi test rekking main desh ko number van par le gaye
 But it is also true that from 2000 to 2010, the team India played 41 Tests abroad, lost only 14
 vahi dhoni kii captaini main 2011 se ab tak khele gaye 24 test main se 15 ganvaa chuki he
 That is, Dhoni is the only lion in the house
 2
 Team India has the highest position in the world in one-day and T20
 dhoni kii captaini ko uskaa shrey bhi jaataa he
 Under his leadership, Team India has won World Cups in both these formats
 lekin ek sachai yah bhi he ki ipel toornament main jis team kaa ve hissaa hai, vah sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Dhoni has also been accused
 ve bisisiai ke vivaadaaspad purv adhyaksh shrinivasana kii company india cement ke bhi emplai hai
 That is, in every way, they are connected to a corporate house, which is also associated with cricket
 ab jabaki bhartiya team ke sabhi khilaadi ipel ke kaaran kisi ne kisi korporate house se jude hai to akele dhoni kii kaise chalegi
 Questions have to be raised on leadership within the team
 bavaal to hone hi hai
 Players like Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan, Zaheer did not leave the team in a very normal environment
 australia main shuruaati do test main team india kii paraajay ho chuki he
 The third survived by losing
 isse pehle ki chauthe or aakhri test kaa aisa hashr hota, dhoni ne achaanak sanyas le liya
 In the middle
 chaunkaate hue
 He told that he wants to focus on odis and T20s, but the question is only on his leadership? After a month and a half, the team will be playing the India ODI World Cup, what seems likely? Will the sympathy from Indian cricket lovers on retirement be strengthened? 11:45 PM colombo tii20 : 9 gend rahete bharat ne match jeeta11:43 PM colombo tii20: srilanka ne rakhaa tha 153 kaa lakshya11:43 PM colombo tii20 : bharat ne srilanka ko 6 wicket haraaya11:42 PM colombo tii20 : bharat 6 wicket se jeeta11:41 PM baluchistan main alpsankhyakon par hota he baari atyachaar pakistani patrkaar aarif tawqir11:27 PM keralah kannur main bijepi netaa santosh par badmaashon ne kiya hamalaa11:25 PM ceiling ke virodh phir band hogi dilli, shavyatra nikaalenge vyapaaree11:12 PM nepal vimaan haadasaah videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne bangladesh se sahanubhuti jataai10:53 PM dillih mahila yatri se chhedchhad ke aarope main ubar kaa driver giraftaar10:41 PM gayak udit narayan ke bete aditya narayan ko durghatana maamle main jamaanat mili10:31 PM tamilnaduh prashasan ke anurodh par vayusena ne rescau oparation roka10:17 PM jammu kashmiri vitt mantralay kaa kaam siem mahabuuba mufti khud dekhengi10:02 PM bhartiya mahila afasar ko blackmel karne main pakistani adhikari ke khilaaf chargeshit09:55 PM maharashtrah siyaasi dalon ke alaava sarkaar ne kii kisaanon ke ilaaj main madad09:49 PM maharashtrah 650 kisaanon kaa jeje aspataal main hua ilaaj09:41 PM bank frod maamle main ek hira company ke purv adhikari hasmukh shah giraftaar09:34 PM nepal vimaan haadasaah galat signal ho sakati he krash kii vajah09:23 PM britainh sansad main mili sandigdh packet main koi khatarnaak cheez nahin-police09:22 PM britainh sansad main sandigdh packet mili, do aspataal main bhartee09:09 PM dilli police ne ek bade nakli degree racket kaa bhandaphod kiya09:01 PM PM modi ne kathmandu main vimaan haadase par jataayaa dukh08:41 PM mumbaih gayak udit narayan ke bete aditya narayan res driving kaa cese darj08:39 PM mumbaih gayak udit narayan ke bete aditya narayan ke khilaaf cese darj08:30 PM raashtrapati ramnath kovind or morishas ke piem pravind jugnath kii baithak08:21 PM kolkatah akhil bhartiya swatchta or saarvajanik swasthya santhaan main aag lagi08:17 PM colombo tii20: bharat ne toss jeeta, fielding kaa faisla08:16 PM mandubadih or patna ke bich nai railgadee sankhya 05125 / 15126 kii shuruyaat08:05 PM maharashtrah maangen maani jane par pradarshan main shaamil nasik ke kisaan khush07:55 PM kathmandu vimaan haadasaah lakhanu airport par kai vimaan roke gaye07:42 PM doctoron kii dekharekh main anand singh bisht kaa kiya ja rahaa he ilaaj07:40 PM siem yogi adityanath ke pita anand singh bisht jolly grant aspataal main hai bhartee07:33 PM teror funding maamle main usoof kamran ko mili jamaanat07:30 PM upi: siem yogi adityanath ke pita aspataal main bhartee07:27 PM tamilnadu ke up mukhyamantri opies aag main jhulase logon se milane pahunche07:25 PM maharashtrah yah aam or garib kisaanon kii jeet he- viju krishna, kisaan sabha ke sachiv07:20 PM punjabah sangrur main kisaan 21 dinon se karj maafee ke liye kar rahe pradarshan07:19 PM yah hamaari jeet he, sarkaar ne 6 maheene main vaada puraa karne ko kaha he-adivasee netaa ji

 ve chahen to koi bhi rasta pakad sakate hai
 You can choose different paths, but the question is whether Lalu and Nitish will continue on the same path together
 
 
 ?bihar vidhansabha chunaav 2015 main congress ko saath lekar bijepi ko maat dene ke baad aisa lag rahaa tha kinitish or lalu kii joddab fevicol ke jod kii manind chipak gai he
 But in the current situation it has become like a tea-immersed biscuit
 ab tuuti kii ab tuuti
 
 vishwaas or bharose ke bina gaadi chal rahi he
 The end of Lalu and Nitish's friendship dates back to 1970, when the two were fighting against a common enemy during the entire revolution movement
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi jab donon arase baad saath aae to bhi donon ke saamne ek hi dushman tha
 
 
 But today Lalu is talking about fighting against who is not a friend of Voneetish, so he is not an enemy either
 or apni siyaasi chaalon se nitish ne ye sabit kar diya he
 Now this time will tell whether Nitish will stay with Lalu or will go to nda's court
 aaie jaanate hai kab-kab rahi lalu-nitish main dosti
 
 
 And when Laxman Rekha was drawn
 
 
 1
 Lalu and Nitish first came together during Jayaprakash Narayan's Socialist Movement
 ye samay kaa takaza tha ki donon ko ek hi dushman ke khilaaf ladanaa tha
 About forty years ago, Lalu and Nitish shook hands
 us dauraan bhi lalu kii ladaai hindutv kii vichaardhaara se thi or inke mukaable apni takat banaae rakhane ke liye lalu nitish kumaar jaise socialist netaa ko apane saath rakhana chaahate the
 Jayaprakash's movement against Indira Gandhi succeeded in bringing about a change of power in Delhi
 ye yuva netaa rup main nitish or lalu kii bhi safalataa thi
 The politics of both was now on track
 2
 The Janata Dal won the Bihar Assembly elections in 1990
 mukhyamantri pad kii res main nitish kumaar ne lalu kii puri madad kii or lalu bihar ke mukhyamantri bane
 3
 do saal baad hi nitish or lalu ke bich matbhed utpann hone lage
 Nitish Kumar was angry with the current Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu for allegedly giving priority to one caste in jobs and corruption in transfer-posting
 4
 In 1994, Nitish Kumar chose a different path from Lalu by forming the Samata Party
 lekin vidhansabha chunaav main nitish ko keval saat siten mili, jabaki lalu duusari baar vidhansabha chunaav jitkar mukhyamantri bane
 5
 1996 main lalu kii siyaasi jindagi main bhuuchaal aayaa
 The Patna High Court ordered a CBI inquiry into the fodder scam and Lalu had to go to jail
 kaha jaataa he ki maamle main jaanch ke liye daakhil yachika ke peeche nitish kumaar kaa bada haath tha
 But Lalu did not let loose the grip on the Chief Minister's chair
 apni patni rabari devi ko mukhyamantri kii kursi par bitha jail chale gaye
 And also won the next assembly election
 6
 After this, Nitish joined hands with the BJP
 endie kii sarkaar main bataur mantri kuch din dilli main rahe or phir bihar laute
 Nitish and BJP joined hands in the 2005 assembly election against Lalu and extinguished the lantern lights of the 15-year-old Lalu era
 7
 Nitish Kumar broke up with the BJP in June 2013 but he had to pay a heavy price for it
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main nitish ko keval do siten mili, jabaki lalu ko chaar siten milin
 By defeating these two, the bjp-led NDA won 31 seats
 8
 a month later, Nitish Kumar approached Lalu for support in the Rajya Sabha elections
 20 saal baad donon netaa gale mili or phir mahagathbandhan kii neenv padi
 The Congress also came together and the bjp-led NDA had to face a tough defeat in the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections
 us samay lalu ko nitish kii jarurat thi or nitish ko unki
 But now the situation is complicated
 
 There has been a lot of disturbance in the politics of Delhi
 lalu or unka parivaar bhrashtachar, benami sampatti ke aarope main ghire hue hai
 bjp's pressure on Nitish is increasing, he is getting invitation to come to NDA
 mahagathbandhan kaa jod kamjor pad rahaa he
 It is to see who among Nitish and Lalu leaves the other's hand first

 Sex life cannot be separated from married life
 agar kisi vajah se SEX life prabhavit ho rahi he to maan lijie ki iskaa sidhaa asar aapke relationships par padegaa
 Although there are many researches around the world about SEX, but a website has studied it by linking it with relationship
 is study main duniya bhar ke logon ne hissaa liya tha
 It was revealed that the main reason for breakdown of marriage or fraud of partner is the disturbance of sex life
 mahilaayein chaahati hai aap jaane sex ke ye 12 rajisamen 60 pratishat purushon or 45 pratishat mahilaon ne kaha ki shaadi ke baad unhone apane partner ko dhokhaa diya
 All of them said that they remain interested in SEX and expect it from their spouse
 ek vyakti ne to yahaan tak likhaa ki wo apni patni ke saath keval ek rummet kii tarah rah rahaa he
 The love between them is over
 swasthya ke liye bhi phydemand he 'sambandh'darasal is study main bhaag lene vaale logon kii raay yah thi ki SEX pyaar kaa ahm hissaa he

 If both of these are taken care of then no one can stop the progress of the country and only the youth of the country can do it
 ye baaten kahin prakhyat shaayar wasim barelvi ne
 He said that the country is going through a big crisis at this time and the youth will have to make a revolution from their home, the day you asked your father, where did one and a half million TV come from the income of 50,000
 unhone sahitya ajtak main ek se ek sher padhe
 Those who kept telling me their sorrow, when they had time, used to go with their hands

 Shamsatheer Khan conducted the session
 barelvi ne apni baat ko aage badhaate hue kaha ki noujvaan khaali slate kii tarah hai or unhen ummid he ki un tak apni baat pahunchaa paaenge
 Barelvi said that 3 men come in the life of women, the first father, the second husband and the third son, the day a wife decided that if the vegetable will be made in the house, then money will change from that day
 unhone kaha ki gharon main baghawat karo
 Faith makes life a life, if faith arises from home, family and society then life will become difficult
 unhone kaha ki halaat aise ho gaye hai ki logon kaa vishwaas uth gaya he
 This social pain needs to be shared
 jis din ham apane aap se sach bolnaa shuru kar denge parivartan kii shuruuaat ho jaaegi
 After this, they have to hit the various police stations one by one, where it is necessary to be alive, then if it is alive, then it is important to look alive, who has to explain himself to the power of new age, where to walk, where it is necessary to go, to defeat the birds when they return to settle It is necessary to have the suppleness of the dull credentials

 Pakistan has prepared the Bad Action Team
 ek aisi team jo hit and ran kii ranneeti istemaal kar bhartiya seemaa se lage ahm thikaanon ko nishaanaa banane kii firaaq main he
 This mission of Pak is also a trick to increase war frenzy
 yah bed ection team pakistani army or aatankiyon ke gathjod se taiyaar kii gai he jo bharat ke khilaaf pakistani sajeesh kaa nayaa hathiyaar he
 According to reports quoting sources, Pakistan has deployed several such squads along the border with Jammu and Kashmir which are ready to infiltrate the Indian border as soon as the opportunity arises
 bed ection team ke naam se taiyaar kiye gaye in daston main pakistani fouj ke commando, purv commandos or khatarnaak aatankwaadiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The purpose of the Bad Action Team is clear
 wo mauka milte hi bhartiya seemaa main ghus kar border se lage sena auki prashasan ke ahm thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaenge or phir usee teji se sarhad ke paar nikal jaaenge
 His targets are the army's tactical headquarters, arms depot, oil reserves and supplies of essential goods
 8-10 logon kii bed ection team ko aisi karravaiyon ke liye khaas training bhi di gai he
 Pakistan's intention behind creating a bad action team is to create a frenzy of war
 aisi karravaiyon ke jariye pakistan seemaa par tanaav ko or badhanaa chahta he taaki duniya ko do parmaanu hathiyaar sampann mulkon ke bich yuddh kaa khauf dikhaaya ja sake
 So that the attention of the world can be drawn from the end of terrorism to the prevention of war and Pakistan has been engaged in this effort since the Mumbai attack
 haalanki bharat pakistan kii is nai sajeesh kaa munhtod jawaab dene ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 The army, security forces and intelligence agencies have been alerted and border surveillance has been tightened
 pakistan bharat ke khilaaf nai sajeesh rach rahaa he
 He wants to bluff the world on the issue of terrorism
 wo paidaa kar rahaa he jang kaa unmaad or isi koshish main usne bhartiya seemaa par phonjo kaa jamaavada badhanaa shuru kar diya he
 The move is also behind removing the army from the western border
 agency kii hawaale se mil rahi khabar ke mutabik pakistan ne jammu-kashmir main poonch or rajouri se lagi niyantran rekha par phonjo kaa jamaavada badha diya he
 The movement of the Pakistani Rangers from Pathankot to Akhnoor in Jammu has also become very fast
 itnaa hi nahin pakistan apni pashchimi kabaili ilaakon se sainikon kii taadaad bhi lagaataar gata rahaa he or unhen bharat se lagi purvi seemaa par tainaat kiya ja rahaa he
 It is reported that Pakistan has recalled one of the two DV personnel of the army stationed in Vajiristan last week and they are being deployed along the border with India
 jammu-kashmir se lagi seemaa par pakistan ne pichley hafte sena ke 5 or brigade tainaat kar die
 The question is, what does Pakistan want to deliver by increasing the mobilization of forces on the border? Indian Army is taking seriously the increasing deployment of Pakistani troops along the border
 lekin kai jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki pakistan jang nahin sirf jang kaa unmaad chahta he kyonki use maaloom he ki jo kaam jang se nahin ho saktaa wo jang kaa unmaad hi kar degi
 In fact, Pakistan understands well that in the battlefield, it cannot compete with the tremendous power of India, but by spreading the frenzy of war, it can divert the attention of the world from the issue of terrorism
 darasal pakistan kii ranneeti ye he ki seemaa par phujon kaa jamaavada badhaa kar wo bharat ko tikhi bayaanbaji ke liye uksaae or phir duniya ko ye bataae ki dakshin asia main halaat kitne khatarnaak ho chuke hai
 Then the world will forget the issue of terrorism and try to stop the war
 pakistan kii is sajeesh kaa pardaafash isliye bhi ho gaya kyonki usne bharat kii seemaa par jin brigades ko tainaat kiya he wo uske strike kor 1 or strike kor 2 kaa hissaa nahin hai
 These brigades belong to the Defense Corps of the Pakistan Army
 pakistan apni is ranneeti kaa doharaa phayda lenaa chahta he
 Pakistan is withdrawing troops from its western tribal areas to weaken the American fight against the Taliban and to pressure the US to pressure India to soften its stand
 jaahir he bhartiya ranneetikaron ko pakistan kii is nai sajeesh kii koi kutnithik kaat nikaalani hogi

 When the speed of the metro started to brake, trains slowly running between different stations from Noida to Dwarka and Vaishali also got affected
 kyonki pragati maidan ke pasametroki speed kam kar dene se trainon kii banching ho gai or trainon ko alag-alag steshnon par roak diya gaya or line clear hone ke baad hi unhen aage jane kii ijazat di gai
 Trouble due to stoppage of metro speed, the speed of the metro stopped, the trouble of the passengers traveling in the metro also increased
 kyonki metro jitani duuri pahal das minutes main tay karti thi, wo badhkar aadha se ek ghante tak ho gai
 As a result, a large crowd of passengers gathered at all the stations on this route
 saath hi metro trainon ke bheetar bhi halaat thasathas vaale ho gaye
 On behalf of DMRC, it was said that the speed was reduced due to a malfunction in the OHE at Pragati Maidan
 taaki trainon ke oparation main rahete hue hi oechai kii marammat kaa kaam kiya ja sake
 But the metro took about two and a half hours to fix the OHE malfunction
 tab metro kaa puraa trek circuit jam ho gaya or yatriyon ko apana safar puraa karne ke liye ghanton tak train main intjaar karnaa padaa
 Due to congestion and delays, many passengers opted out of the metro and used other modes of travel
 dilli metro ke pravaktaa ke mutabik kareeb paune teen baje jaakar oechai kii kharabi dur kii gai
 But metrokee services could not take place till the normal evening as the bunching of trains took another three hours to return to normalcy
 is vajah se shaam ko peak avars main bhi metro ke musafiron ko samasya kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 sawaal ye uthta he ki kya party vidhayakon ke gambhir maamalon ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he? Voting was being held for the by-elections in three assembly seats in West Bengal on November 25 and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced her government's decision to give ownership of land to 11,900 refugee families in the state
 mamata ne ghoshnaa kii, ''yahaan 48 saal se adhik samay tak rahane, apni aajeevika kamaane, apane bacchon ko skool bhejne or vot daalane ke baavjood, in sharnaarthiyon ke liye 'ghar kaa na ghat kaa' vaali sthiti rahi he
 We have decided to regularize all refugee colonies
 ''ghoshnaa kaa yah vakt ranneetik rup se kaaphi soch-samajhakar chunaa gaya he kyonki bengal main bhaajapa baar-baar yah baat doharaa rahi he ki assam kii tarj par rashtriya naagarikta register (enarasi) ko deshbhar main taiyaar karaayaa jayega
 Mamta is constantly saying that she will not allow this in her state
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki isaki padtaal ke itar ki unke faisle se kitne sharnaarthi labhanvit honge, mamata ne sateek chaal chalate hue yah to sanket de diya ki unki sarkaar musalamaanon or hinduon, donon ke kalyaan ke liye ek samaan chintit he
 In fact, as compared to 150 refugee colonies located on central government land, only 94 colonies are inhabited on Bengal government land
 dilachasp baat yah he ki jin siton par upachunaav ho rahaa tha unamem se do kshetron, nadiya main karimpur or uîri dinajpur main kaaliyaganj kii simaaen bangladesh ke saath lagati hai
 These regions have felt the pressures of illegal cross-border migration
 kaliganj main jahaan musalamaanon kii aabaadi lagbhag 20 pratishat he, vahiin assam main jari antim enarasi suchi se lakhon hindu pariwaron ko bhi baahar rakhe jane ke baad se in kshetron kii hindu aabaadi bhi bahut tanaav main he
 "every other day, the BJP says new things about NRC," says Aghor Das, a resident of Nadia
 ham hindu hai or ham bangladesh chhodkar aae hai
 We are worried that what documents they will ask us
 '' kaliganj main rahane vaale bhuwan bairangi kehete hai, ''rajya main aatmahatya kii kai ghatnaayen hui hai
 There were many Hindus among them
 ham kaise maane ki ham surakshit hai?''presidency uniwarsity, kolkata ke professor emritus prashanth re kehete hai, ''mamata banerjee ne yah sandesh diya he ki hindu sharnaarthiyon ke liye ve vah sab kuch kar rahi hai jo kar sakati hai
 Mamta is presenting herself as a 'watchman' protecting people from NRC
 yah bengali 'paharedaar' kaa nerrative piem narendra modi kii ore se istemaal kiye jane vaale 'chaukeedaar' shabd ke samakaksh he
 Mamata says in an aggressive tone, "they (BJP) have to deal with me before touching any citizen from Bengal
" 
 
 assam main bhaajapa kaa shashan he isliye vah vahaan enarasi ko lagu kar sakati he
 "this issue is also drawing attention among people of Gorkha, Rajbongshi and other ethnic groups in North Bengal
" kooch bihar raily main, mamata ne daawa kiya ki assam enarasi main shaamil kiye gaye 12 lakh bengaaliyon main se 11 lakh rajbongshi the, jabaki darjeeling main unhone kaha ki 1,50,000 gorkhaon ko enarasi se baahar kar diya gaya
 Rajbongshias played a major role in bjp's victory in the Lok Sabha seats of Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri, while the Gorkhas supported the party in Darjeeling
 mamata ne naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko centre kaa 'lollypop' bataakar uskaa makhul udaate hue kaha ki yah nagarikon ko unke adhikaron kii guarantee nahin de saktaa
 The BJP has been on the back foot ever since the name of Hindus was left out of the massive NRC in Assam and it is advocating the bill as a safeguard for Hindus and other non-muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan
 
 rabindra bharti vishvavidhyalay, kolkata main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor vishwanath chakravarti kehete hai, ''trinmul congress musalmaan or hindu donon sharnaarthiyon ko yah vishwaas dilaakar ki bhaajapa shasit rajyon main koi bhi surakshit nahin he, enarasi ke mudde kaa raajnneetik phayda uthaa rahi he
 The BJP has so far not been able to find any cut

 Mamta, who arrived in the city of Burdwan in Burdwan district of West Bengal on Monday to address the Mati Utsav, once again called Modi as a task to shut down not only the state but also the industries across the country
 mamata ne kaha ki hamaare peeche sibiai, iti lagane se kya hoga, kitne logon ko giraftaar karenge
 If Modi Babu wants to arrest everyone, he will only make India a prison
 mamtane kaha ki raashtrapati ko is maamle main dakhsandaji kar sthiti main sudhaar kii pahal kerani chahie, mamata ne kaha ki ham agle 72 ghanton ke liye iske liye andolan karne ja rahe hai
 Mamta Banerjee, who arrived here as the keynote speaker at the Mati festival, said that she knows that the business is going down, she said that i am very sad
 mujhe pataa he ki kisaan rabi kii fasal kaa kaam nahin kar paaen he
 Mamta said that the farmer of a village in Burdwan could not give money to the laborers due to lack of money in the bank and killed himself
 mamata boleen ki cashles india kaa baat kiya ja rahaa he, cash hi nahin hai or cashles india kii baaten
 The laborers working under MNREGA are not getting money after wages, today it is learned that 100 days of work is not being done due to lack of Aadhaar card
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki abhi 12 pratishat gaanvon main bank hi nahin he is faisle se desh kaa sarvanaash kiya ja rahaa he
 Mamta said that now what will happen if the card does not run even at the petrol pump, the factories are constantly being closed
 mamata boleen to kya modi babu, aapaki puja karen yaa logon ko bachaaen
 He said that people are facing a lot of difficulty in withdrawing money from banks, 40 percent of the banks have no money and 60 percent of the money is closed

 Virat Kohli, the star batsman of Team India, is today celebrating his 28th birthday
 viraat ne behad hi kam samay main jin bulandiyon ko chuaa he
 Hardly any such cricketer has been able to do so
 viraat aaj desh ke hi nahin balki duniya ke sabase chahate cricketron main se ek hai
 Whether there is a country or a foreign country, there is a long army of fans of Kohli
 chiku se kaise bane viratviraat ko kareeb se jaanane vaale or unke timmets unhen 'chiku' ke naam se pukaarte hai
 After all, let us tell you how Virat was named Chiku
 iske peeche ek behad hi dilachasp kahani he
 It is a matter of time when Virat had joined the Delhi Ranji team fresh and was trying to prove himself
 tab tak viraat ne sirf 10 ranjai mukaable hi khele the
 The Delhi Ranji team included legendary players like Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rajat Bhatia and Mithun Manhas in those days and Virat was quite happy to share the dressing room with all of them
 us samay dilli or mumbai kii timen ranjai mukaable main takaraa raheen thi
 One evening Virat saw a hair salon near his hotel and from there came back to the hotel in a new look after having his hair cut
 hotel main maujuud duusare khilaadiyon se viraat ne apane nae hair cat ke bare main poocha ki yah kaisaa lag rahaa he
 So Delhi assistant coach Ajit Chaudhary replied that you look like Chiku and such Virat Kohli got the name Chiku
 viraat kohli ne 2008 main pehla antarrashtriya vanade muqabla khelaviraat kohli jab under 19 or ranjai muqablon main khel rahe the
 Since then everyone knew that this miss of Delhi will play for the country one day and Virat Kohli was included in the Indian ODI team against Sri Lanka in 2008
 us siries main viraat kuch khaas kamaal to nahin dikhaa sake the or sirf ek hi half centuri lagaai thi
 But in the year 2009, Virat Kohli's bat started showing his bat internationally
 kohli ne johanisburg main westeindies ke khilaaf noteout 79 ran kii pari kheli phir kolkata main srilanka ke khilaaf 107 ran banaae
 Since then, Kohli's bat started to perform brilliantly at his international level
 videshi jameen par khub banaae ranviraat kohli ne australia, south africa, england, westeindies or newjiland jaisi tiimon ke khilaaf unheen kii dharti par khub ran banaae or dekhte hi viraat ballebaaj bana gaye
 In every format of cricket, Virat has shown his batting glory
 wo aaj duniya ke behtareen ballebaajon main se ek hai
 Kohli scored 52 in 176 odis for the country
 93 kii ausat se 7570 ran bana chuke hai
 Which includes his 26 centuries and 38 half-centuries
 jis tarah se wo shatak jad rahe usase ye lagane laga he ki wo sachin tendulkar ke sabase zyada shatakon ke record ko todenge
 Kohli was made the captain of the Test team in the year 2014-15
 Virat Kohli was included in the Indian Test team under the captaincy of Dhoni in the year 2011
 lekin mahendra singh dhoni ke test captaini chhodte hi unhen 2014-15 main australia daure par viraat ko test team kaa captain banaaya gaya
 At that time the Indian team was undergoing a change
 dhoni ke sanyas ne team ko musiibat main laa diya tha
 So even reports of estrangement in the team were no less than a challenge for Kohli
 aise main viraat kohli ne na sirf team ko ekajute kiya balki apane khilaadiyon par bharosa jataate hue team main aakraamakata bhi bhari
 In that tour, Virat Kohli scored a century in the first match under the captaincy
 kohli chauthe aise bhartiya captain bane jinhone captaini karte hue pehle hi match main shatak lagaaya
 Under the captaincy of the Test team, Viratvirat Kohli, who has been a hit, succeeded in defeating Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka and West Indies in the West Indies
 kohli kii captaini main bhartiya team ne abtak srilanka, dakshin africa, west indies or newjiland ko haraane main kaamyaab hui he
 At the same time, a match series from Bangladesh ended on the draw
 kohli kii captaini main bhartiya team ne ab tak 16 test khele hai, jinamein team ko nau main jeet do main haar mili he, to paanch match drow rahe hai
 At the same time, the team has not lost a single match on home grounds
 viraat kohli kii captaini main team teen baar number ek ban chuki he
 For the first time under the captaincy of Nazarkohli on the Test series against England, the Indian team became number one in january-february 2016
 iske baad team ne isi saal agast main number ek kii kursi hasil kii thi or ab teesri baar newjiland ko haraakar bharat ne yah uplabdhi hasil kii he
 It is clear that under the captaincy of Kohli, the team is growing more and the winning appetite is increasing, which can prove to be a very good thing for any team
 ab kohli kii najar england ke khilaaf paanch test match kii siries par kabja jamane par he
 The way the Indian team is playing under Kohli's leadership, it is clear that the road to England will not be easy in any way
 abtak kohli ne 48 test match khelte hue kareeb 46 kii ausat se 6592 ran banaae hai
 Which includes 13 centuries and 12 half-centuries
 bhagavaandas morwal kaa ek nayaa upanyaas aayaa he—sur banjaaran
 We have hardly any story or novel written in Hindi literature based on the life of any actor, folk artist or folk singer
 surendra verma ke upanyaas mujhe chand chahie ne jarur ek abhinetri kii jivan gaatha ke bahaane se rashtriya natya vidhyalay or aadhunik hindi rangamanch kaa gaharaai se jayja liya tha
 Abhiram Bhadkamkar's novel Bal Gandharva in Marathi and Vinodini Dasi's novel Nati Vinodini in Bengali have been popular works
 yun marathi main hi shirvarkar ke naatak nat samraat kaa ullekh bhi kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi uski rachana ke liye italvi bhashaa ke suprasiddh naatakkaar lui pirandelo ke naatak henry da forth se prerana mili
 This novel should be underlined for two reasons
 ek nautanki natya style kii gayika or kalakaar raagini kii jeevanagaatha ko to prastut karata hi he, isse bhi zyada yah is natya style ke janm, utthan or patan kii mahagatha ko bade hi maarmik dhang se hamaare saamne laata he
 We know that there is a strong emphasis on acting in the Kanpur style of Nautanki and singing in the Hathras style
 morwal ne bade manoyog se shodh-anusandhan or puri khojbin ke saath ek-ek tathy ko ughadkar rakh diya he
 All the characters in the novel are so familiar to us that as we read, we become united with them
 is upanyaas main jagah-jagah is baat kii sambhaavnaaen thim ki saare vivaran bahut hi bhavuk or melodramatic ho jate
 But nowhere did the writer allow this to happen, whether it was the context of Ragini's mother's death or the event of her husband's death during the performance — the way these episodes are composed, the writer's artistic restraint is evident
 isse bada sanyam or kya hoga ki shahjahan ke sabase bade bete darashukoh ne jis shahar ko basaaya or jisamen isaki nayika raagini rahati thi, uskaa naam upanyaas kii antim chaar panktiyon main jaakar hamaare saamne aata he
 Reading Sur Banjaran was a delightful experience for me
 iske liye lekhak kii sahaj-saral bhashaa, bich-bich main lokbhasha or boli kaa put or muhaavaron se pusht style is anubhav ke liye jimmedaar he
 The author is entangled with his plot and his heroine to the extent that some facts have been ignored
 udhaaharan ke liye aisa nahin tha ki aagaa hashr kashmiri ko parsi rangamandali main roj ek naatak likhakar dena hota tha
 The truth is that he had to write a new play in a year
 yahaan is baat kaa zikr karnaa bhi jaruri lagata he ki upanyaas main aae lagbhag sabhi paatro ke naam vaastavik hai, aise main sirf nayika kaa naam kaalpanik kyon? iske peeche rachanaakaar ke kuch saamaajik dabaav avashya rahe honge
 Despite this, this novel can definitely be considered a milestone in content, design style and readability

 The actor shared a journey from a modest city like Gwalior to a Bollywood superstar

 Then i saw Panchanama's audition after two and a half years on Facebook and reached there
 actor ne bataaya ki jab vah audishan main riject ho jate the to vah sochate the ki jo audishan le rahaa he use samaj nahin he
 He felt that he who is taking the audition did not understand

 Rajkumar Rao has recently appeared in the film Omerta, in which his performance was highly appreciated
 pashchim bengalwam ke astitv kaa sawalpaschim bengal gujarat ke dhur ulti disha kaa rajya he or dilachasp yah ki isi rajya kii mukhyamantri narendra modi ko sabase aakraamak andaaj main lalkaar rahi hai, to bhaajapa bhi isi rajya main apane pradarshan ko sudharkar hindi pattee ke apane sambhavit nuksaan ko puraa karnaa chaahati he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won just two seats in West Bengal and finished second in three seats
 lekin yah ab tak bengal main bhaajapa kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan rahaa he
 Earlier in 1991, BJP 11 in Bengal
 66 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 Analysts believe that the Left Front organization in the state has weakened and now the direct fight is between Trinamool Congress vs BJP
 vaise, rajya main vam morcha or congress siton ke lihaaj se talmail kar rahe hai
 At present, they are in sync with the six seats where the Congress and the Left Front won
 agar vam morcha or congress saath laden, to vot share ke lihaaj se unki takat trinmul ke baraabar ho jaaegi
 In 2014, there were 4 seats, Alipur Duar, Jangipur, Murshidabad and Raiganj, with less than 25,000 votes
 in siton par pehle or duusare sthaan par congress or vam morcha hi rahaa tha
 In every by-election since 2016, the BJP has performed better than the Congress and the Left Front
 or ab uski nigaah kai congressi or tiemasi netaaon ko apane paale main laane kii he
 However, Muslim votes are important in the equation of the Left Front, Congress and TMC three
 agar ye vot bante to bhaajapa kii daal gal jaaegi
 The challenge of repeating the performance was the repeat of the 2014 results of vote share in the 2016 assembly elections in Assam
 soobe main endie (bhaajapa-agap-bidief-arajeeem-tigeeem) ne kul 86 siten jeetin assam main bhaajapa ne jin muddon kaa ubhaar diya he, ve pehle assam gana parishad ke mudde the
 In Upper Assam, one of the three regions of Assam, the BJP has tripled the vote share and its vote share has gone up to 45 percent
 is ilaake main bhaajapa ne congress ke hisse ke vot hathiyaa liye, jahaan congress kaa vot share bhi girakar 41 se 34 fisad ho gaya
 Upper Assam was the fort of the Assam Gana Parishad
 vahaan agap ko mahaj 5 fisad vot hasil hue
 In a way, the BJP is standing on the agp's ground
 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik, assam main kareeb 34
 2 percent are Muslim

 Now the return of the parties like Bodo People's Front (BPF) and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the joining of new parties like Sikkim Revolutionary Front, bjp's enthusiasm is in the seventh heaven

 The Madhav and Sarma duo have already promised the central leadership to bring 22 seats out of the 25 seats here
 aise main jab ruthe kshatrap or kuch nae sahyogiyon ne bhaajapa kaa daaman thama, to josh to haai hona hi tha
 At present there are 11 regional parties with BJP in NEDA
 assam ko chhodkar baaki purvottar main maujuuda samay main bhaajapa ke paas keval ek seat he jabaki congress ke paas paanch seat hai
 But if we talk about the bjp-alliance, then the total seats are four

 PM Modi said, 'there was a time when Bollywood films were shot in Kashmir
 us daur main shaayad hi koi aisi film hoti thi jisaki shooting kashmir main nahin hoti thi
 Now, if conditions are normal in Jammu and Kashmir, then not only the country but many filmmakers from all over the world will be able to come to Kashmir to shoot and at the same time create many employment opportunities for the people of Kashmir

 Pakistan's lie on Kashmir exposed expatriate Hamid Mir has exposed the Pakistani lies of Imran's support for 58 countries in Kashmir's United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHCR) by a senior journalist himself
 patrkaar ne apni report main saaf kiya he ki aisa koi samarthan sire se maujuud nahin tha jisaki vajah se pakistan niyat samay par yuanechasiaar main apana prastaav pesh nahin kar sakaa
 This journalist is Hamid Mir and has exposed the rulers of his country in Geo News Urdu and exposed them
 mir ne apni report kii shuruyaat main likhaa he, 'naakaami yaa galati ko maan lene vaale bahadur kehalaate hai
 Those who make excuses or lie on failure are not only cowards but also those who cannot be trusted
 'unhone likhaa, 'pakistani kaum se bhi aisa hi ek bahut badi naakaami ko chipaaya ja rahaa he
 Whoever questions it will be called traitor and corrupt
 lekin, sawaal to uthegaa
 'mir wrote,' the question is that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi claimed in Geneva on 11 September that Pakistan has submitted a statement to the United Nations Human Rights Council with the support of more than 50 countries in which India demanded It has gone to stop violating human rights in 'occupied' Kashmir
 'unhone likhaa ki bharat ne kuraishi ke is bayaan ko turant khaarij kar diya or kaha ki 50 se adhik deshon ke samarthan kii baat jhooth he
 Mir wrote, 'the next day on September 12, Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed that the statement made by Pakistan in the United Nations Human Rights Council has the support of 58 countries
 imran ne in deshon kaa shukriya bhi adaa kar diya
 He wrote that India denied this too, but the Pakistani community was told that Pakistan is getting huge diplomatic success on the issue Kashmir
 pakistani patrkaar ne likhaa, 'pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar parishad main 19 sitambar tak bharat ke khilaaf prastaav pesh karnaa tha taaki uski roshni main jammu-kashmir par sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar parishad kii vishesh baithak bulaai ja sake
 For this resolution, Pakistan needed the support of only 16 of the 47 member countries of the Council
 'hamid mir ne bataaya, "is prastaav ke liye 19 sitambar kii dopaher ek baje kii dedline tay thi
 i contacted key people in Islamabad and Geneva since morning to find out the names of the countries supporting the Pakistani resolution
 pehle kaha gaya, phikr na karen, thodi der main prastaav pesh hone vaala he, phir naam bataaenge
 Mir wrote, 'when the deadline passed, it was told that the proposal had not been submitted
 yah sunakar maine poocha ki hamaare pradhanmantri ne to 58 mulkon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya tha or yahaan to sirf 16 ke samarthan kii jarurat thi
 Then why did the proposal not submit? It was said that ask Shah Mahmood Qureshi
 to janaab, sawaal bada sada he
 If you did not have the support of 16 countries then why did you claim the support of 58 countries? And, if you had enough support then why not submit the offer
 kya chakkar chal rahaa he or koun kisko chakkar de rahaa he
 He wrote, "come on, if there is a failure in securing the support of 16 countries, then it is fine, but why the support of 58 countries was claimed to hide the failure? By lying to the Pakistani community, you are a part of Kashmir

 The girl accused of raping Singer Ankit Tiwari, finally breaking her silence, has rejected the claims made by Ankit's lawyer
 itnaa hi nahin event management company main kaam karne vaali peedita ne khulaasa kiya he ki ankit ne use dhamkee di thi ki agar usne apana munh kholaa to vah rape video saarvajanik kar degaa
 According to an English newspaper, the victim said, 'I met Ankit during Durga Puja in October 2012, about a year before Ankit
 uske vakil kaa ye daawa ki maine do saal pehle usase shaadi kii thi
 This is a lie
 ' peedita ne is baat se bhi inkaar kiya ki usne ankit se teen karod rupye anthne kii koshish kii thi
 He said, 'I met Ankit when he was a Strugler
 maine uske liye mobile phone kharida tha or uske telephone bills bhare hai
 If you have not earned even one crore rupees till today, how can you accuse someone of making three crores rupees? i am a VP of a company and i do not need the money
 ''shaadi kaa jhootha sapana dikhaaya'peedita ve bataaya ki ankit ne 4-5 mulakaaton ke baad use prapoj kiya
 He said, 'I remember he proposed to me in a coffee shop in Lokhandwala
 maine use tabhi kaha tha ki hamaara rishta lanbaa nahin chal paaegaa kyonki main talakshuda hum or meri ek beti he
 He still told me that he would convince his family
 'peedita ne kaha ki ankit jhooth bol rahaa he ki use meri pehali shaadi ke bare main nahin pataa tha
 The 28-year-old victim said, 'ankit introduced me to his mother but like a friend
 kyonki vah is maamle main jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chahta tha
 He said that once he became a celebrity, his family would have to accept me
 mujhe laga vah apane parivaar ko achche se jaanata he or main isliye chup rahi
 The victim told that she had also called Ankit at her sister's birthday party on July 21
 peedita ke mutabik, 'vah raat ko kareeb 11:30 baje party main aayaa
 He persuaded me to drink alcohol together and took me to another room
 kamare main le jane ke baad bhi usne mujhe sharaab pilaai or uske baad mere munh paar haath rakhkar usne mere saath shaareerik sambandh banaaya
 My sister also saw him coming out of the room
 'yah sab dekhakar meri bahan ne use agle din ghar bulaayaa
 Ankit promised my sister that he would marry me
 lekin jab maine ankit se is bare main baat kii to usne mujhe blackmel karnaa shuru kar diya
 The victim said that Ankit had recorded everything that day and on the basis of this, he warned that he should not talk about rape
 unhone kaha ki ankit unhe daraata tha ki agar iske bare main unhone baat kii to vah us video soshal media par aplod kar degaa
 The victim said, 'I fell silent for fear of slander and carried this relationship forward
 jab bhi ankit ko sex karnaa hota tha to vah apane saath vahi video clip le aata tha'
 'ankit's manager slapped me too' Troubled by Ankit Tiwari's antics, the victim decided to talk to Ankit's family members
 peedita ne aarope lagaaya he ki ankit ke manager ankur ne use thappad maaraa or ghar se dhakke maar kar baahar nikaal diya
 Ankur is Ankit's brother
 peedita ne bataaya ki ankit ne agle din iske liye usase maafee maangi or donon kii baatcheet phir se shuru ho gai
 But when Ankur had a clue about this, he reached to threaten the victim
 chaaku kii nonk par ankur ne peedita ko dhamkee di ki vah uske bhai kii jindagi se chali jaae
 'started preparing to marry me, wanted to get engaged with someone else' The victim alleged that Ankit's behavior changed after receiving several awards
 unhone bataaya ki ankit ke saath unki shaadi kii sari aupchaariktaayen puri kar lee gai thim
 Even Ankit's signature was taken
 bas document jamaa karne kii der thi jab ankit ne bataaya ki uski shaadi kisi or se ho rahi he
 After this, when the victim met Ankit's family, the argument started again and Ankur slapped him once more

 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has said that the reasons for the decline in the stock markets are concerns about economic revival in the US and external elements such as the debt crisis in the euro area
 unhone ummid jataai ki utaar-chadhaav asthai he tathaa isamen jaldi hi sudhaar hoga
 Mukherjee told reporters, this is not a domestic matter
 yah pramukh rup se bahya tatwon kaa nateeja he
 During the trading, the Sensex fell by more than 700 points at one time and fell below 17,000
 haalanki baad main isamen sudhaar hua or antat: yah 387 ank kii giravat ke saath band hua
 The Finance Minister said, "this is mainly the effect of the resumption of the US economy as expected

 Congress leader DK Shivakumar calls it "sankat Mochan"
 or, aaj karnataka ke yah diggaj netaa mumbai ke renicense hotel ke baahar party ke ek maatr vyakti ke rup main dikhaai die
 He waited for hours in the rain to meet the rebel mlas whose resignation has brought the Karnataka government to a standstill
 badi taadaad main maujuud media ke log diceyes kii gatividhiyon kaa bina saans liye lagaataar apadet dete rahe
 Mumbai Congress leaders and activists were not present to support DKS
 ve soshal media par ek-duusare par hamale karne main vyast the
 The ruling coalition of Karnataka hangs with just one thread following the developments in the resignation of rebel mps
 udhaaharan ke liye, milind devda, jinhone "rashtriya bhoomika" kii apeksha main pichley saptaah maharashtra kaa adhyaksh pad chhod diya, ne pehle twit kiya ki unhone diceyes ko phone kiya or phir soshal media par congress samarthakon ke baari hangaame ke baad dopaher baad sab chhod diya
 Under the supervision of Deora, the Congress lost all six seats in Mumbai in the recent general elections
 maharashtra main teen maheene baad rajya sarkaar ke liye chunaav hone hai
 Despite this, Congress leaders here are busy in power struggle to gain power away from morality
 sanjay nirupam, jinke sthaan par devda ko mumbai congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha, ab soshal media par khuleam un par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Urmila Matondkar, who lost to Mumbai North, wrote a letter to Deora in which Nirupam's colleagues were heavily criticized
 yah patr li ho gaya
 Then Nirupam, who leaked the letter, attacked Deora, calling him a "young dynasty"
 unhone twit kiya tha ki devda ne yah gur "apane guru jetali" se siikhe the
 Shivkumar's complete discipline is contrasted with this ugly rut
 yahaan tak ki jab unhen 2013 main karnataka main siddharmaiya ke netritv vaali congress sarkaar se baahar rakhaa gaya tha, to unhone ek bhi shabd saarvajanik rup se kisi bhi keemat par nahin kaha tha
 He was made a minister in 2014
 2017 main rajyasabha chunaav main ahamed patel kii jeet sunishchit karne ke liye diceyes ne party ke sabhi vidhayakon ko ek resort main rakhaa tha
 It was probably because of his efforts that he was raided by the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate
 lekin is par bhi ve adig rahe
 DKS was in constant touch with Sonia Gandhi and her political advisor Ahmed Patel since morning
 maine diceyes ko phone kiya or unhone mujhe bataaya ki congress ke sabhi vidhayak mumbai main ek saath kaise ghoomte hai
 He said that they are his "friends, whom i love and who can never lose me
" " jab maine maharashtra ke netaaon se samarthan kii kami ke bare main poocha, to diceyes ne hansate hue kaha ki line kharaab he or ve mujhe phone karenge
 Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has caused a crisis in the party with his resignation
 kal sansad main congress ke vidhayakon ko tode jane ke khilaaf naare lagaae gaye the
 Rahul is on a visit to his traditional constituency Amethi from where he lost
 gandhi ne pehle ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve 25 may ko adhyaksh pad se istipha de denge; party ko ab tak apane netritv ko lekar koi samaadhaan nahin mila he
 The Congress "high command" seems to have broken down and this has created the possibility of a conflict between the old leaders and the young Turks to take the party under control
 sonia gandhi ne is par dhyaan diya or kathith taur par punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ko antarim adhyaksh ke rup main morcha sanbhaalane kii peshkash kii
 Singh sensibly refused and said that "a young and dynamic leader should make Rahul Gandhi a success
" "yuva or bade paimaane par hakdaar netaa chhichley rup main rahul gandhi ke aasapaas ekajute hote hai
 They want to gain control from Sonia Gandhi's loyalists
 to aapke paas jyotiraditya sindhiya hai, jo uttar pradesh (pashchim) ke mahasachiv hai
 They accept responsibility for the loss of the party at the national level and zero score in their area
 lekin congress adhyaksh banaae jane kii ummid main sindhiya upi ke pad par asin ho gaye
 Posters appeared in Madhya Pradesh for his appointment to the post of president
 unke pratidwandviyon kaa kahana he ki unki vifaltaa ke liye unhen puraskrit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Even Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi, who claimed he was Sonia Gandhi's Hindi tutor, targeted arch enemy Patel at a press conference on Monday
 dvivedi ne daawa kiya ki rahul gandhi ke sthaan par nai niyukti ke liye sabhi baithken adhikrut nahin kii gai thim
 It was stated as evidence that AK Antony did not attend any of these meetings
 ek varisht congressi netaa kehete hai, "yahaan tak ki dvivedi ne bhi ab apni aawaaj uthaai he
 They are setting the score with Patel
 unhen pataa hona chahie ki ve itane apraasangik hai ki unhen kisi bhi ucch stareey baithak ke liye aamantrit nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 "meanwhile, Haryana general secretary in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad publicly stated that the election committee constituted by the party's state head Ashok Tanwar is" illegal "
 haryana main bhi teen maheene main chunaav honge
 BJP is expected to get a walkover here
 gandhi parivaar kii teen yuva upaadhyakshon ke saath antarim adhyaksh banane kii yojana ko bhi yuva netaaon ne vito kar diya he
 They say that this will not give them any power
 ek daavedaar or yuva netaa ne mujhase kaha, "main ek yuva baccha nahin hum jise ek bekaar lollypop ke saath shant kiya ja saktaa he
 Make me Chief Minister and we'll talk
 koi or bekaar kaam nahin
 "I wrote here that after the re-election of Modi on a large scale, all the Congress governments are hanging on by a thread
 yah karnataka main aaj ek vaastaviktaa he kyonki gathbandhan ek agyaat patan ke kagaar par he
 The next one can be Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan tak ki rajasthan main, ashok gahalot or unke dipti sachin payalat ke bich puraani ladaai congress sarkaar ke saath janata kaa mohabhang sunishchit kar rahi he
 To prevent the Congress from further breakdown, leaders like DKS should be empowered by the Gandhi family
 kya aisa hoga? ek varisht netaa, jo diceyes ke sangrakshak hai, kehete hai, nahin
 According to him, the current need is for a "puppet president" to make a huge mess and welcome Gandhis as savior

 ek hi din kii do ghatnaayen hai- kareeb 700 kilometre ke faasale par
 20 people are killed in police action in Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh and five in Warangal in Telangana
 police alag alag rajyon kii he - ek andhra pradesh kii or duusari telugana kii
 In both incidents, the police has only one theory - encounter and firing in self-defense
 kya police or kya sarkaar?police ko khatra kisase tha? andhra pradesh main kuch aise logon se jinke haathon main hansiya, kulhadi or pathar the, jinhen police ne chandan taskar bataaya he
 Similarly, in Telangana, five people who had handcuffs in their hands, were being taken to court for production

 The National Human Rights Commission has also issued notice to the Chief Secretary and the DGP, taking cognizance of themselves
 chitoor kii ghatana main ek nai baat saamne ai he, wo ye ki karrwai main maare gaye 20 main se saat logon ko police ne ek bas se uthaaya tha
 Shekhar, a resident of a village in Tamil Nadu, is said to be an eyewitness in the case
 shekhar ne jo aapbeetee sunai he uske anusaar wo ek mahila ke saamne vaali seat par baitha tha, isliye police ne use bas se nahin utaara
 The police thought that she was the woman's husband
 shekhar sahit aath log somvaar kii dopaher apane gaanv se nikle the, lekin keval shekhar hi ghar laut sakaa, jabaki saaton ke police muthbhed main maare jane kii khabar hi ghar pahunch pai
 Similarly, the picture related to the Telangana incident has appeared in the newspaper, which is also enough to raise suspicion on the police story
 isamen gaadi main ek kaidi kaa shav padaa hua he
 He is in his hand as well as handcuffs
 baaki kuch kehane kii jarurat bachati kahaan he?video laae, wo bhi farjipulice ke daawey ke sahi tehraane ke liye buudhvaar ko andhra pradesh sarkaar kii ore se ek video pesh kiya gaya
 According to the government claim, the people who are seen cutting the wood in the video are all sandalwood smugglers, who were killed in the encounter by the STF
 lekin is sarkari daawey kii hawa nikaalte hue rajya ke sipiai netaa janardan kaa kahana he ki ye video chitoor kaa nahin, balki mamadur forest kaa he jise is ghatana se pehle hi shoot kiya gaya
 And Shobha Deye on target is related to Mamlatta and Siyasat vs freedom of expression
 soshlite or lekhika shobhaa de ne marathi filmon ko lekar maharashtra sarkaar ke farmaan kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki marathi filmein unhen pasand hai, par unhen kab or kahaan dekhnaa he, yah unhen khud tay karne dena chahie
 Shobhaa De had termed the government decree as 'dadagiri'
 is par maharashtra vidhansabha se lekhika ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice to pehle hi jari ho chukaa he
 Now the Shiv Sena has attacked him through a provocative article in Saamana
 saath hi shivasainikon ne unke ghar par pradarshan bhi kiya or ek netaa ne to yahaan tak kaha ki unhen vada pav or musal pav bhi khilaayaa jayega
 If someone likes a film, he watches it again and again
 dakshin bharat kii tamaam filmein isaki misaal hai
 Movies of such regional languages are shown day and night on a dozen TV channels and people watch them again and again
 koi ye bhi kah saktaa he ki in filmon ko dab kiye jane kii vajah se log dekhte hai
 If so, why did people see it earlier when they were shown as they were? aise to hollywood kii filmein haal main jaakar yaa dividi lekar bahut se log dekhte hai - unamem se kitne aise honge jinhen puri angreji thik thik samaj main aati hogi? vaise bhi sari filmein angreji main hi nahin banati
 Some languages are German or French or Spanish
 phir bhi log ek ek shot gaur se dekhte hai
 Topper will tell it only to the knowledgeable of films
 par jahaan tak sawaal language kaa he to filmon kii to apni bhashaa hoti he

 Will we do the same by going to Mars? After all what should we name this era? " "bollywood kii shanti deepika padukon ne un atakalon ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki unhone apni gardan par chori- chori, chupake-chupake apane bwoyfriend ranbir kapur kaa tatu banwaaya he
 Otherwise this news had spread like a fire in Bollywood, Ranbir's name has been stamped on Deepika's neck
 yani ek aisi sambhaavna banane lagi thi ki shanti hameshaa hameshaa ke liye saanwariyaa kii ho sakati he
 But Deepika has broken this confusion of Ranbir Kapoor of bachna-e-haseen
 deepika ne ranbir ke naam kaa tatu karwaane manaa kar diya to haseenon kaa nayaa aashiq bhi kuch kam nahin niklaa
 With his intentions, he told me that i do not want to become the second Saif Ali Khan of Bollywood
 lekin saanwariyaa ne chote nawab ko lalkaarane andaaj main bahut kuch kah diya
 Sanwariya clearly said that for my love i do not need anyone's certificate or any tattoo, nor will i ever make a tattoo
 jaahir he agar ranbir ke badan par deepika kaa tatu ban jaataa he yaa phir deepika kii gardan par ranbir kaa tatu
 So this crazy lover's claim that abstinence would go breathless
 
 
 
 That is, both are in love with each other but are not ready to get the tattoo stamped

 Today, the entire Congress leadership is in Jaipur, where they have to work their way to find ways to keep themselves active and appear sensitive and active on social media
 technology to mahaj ek jariya he
 The party needs a message to reach out to politically conscious youth and angry women
 isamen jabardast vidambnaa he: congress main aaj bhi adhyaksh ek mahila hai or ek youth iken iske bhavi netaa hai
 But just like other parties on the issue of how a young woman was gang-raped and tortured in Delhi, the Congress was not able to pacify angry India

 ’’ yah bhi itnaa hi dilachasp he ki chintan shivi main soshal media par baatcheet ko rajnatik chunautiyon ke satr main shaamil kiya gaya he
 The Congress has recognized the power of social media due to the agitations of Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal and the protests following the Delhi rape scandal
 hajaare kaa andolan jab oonchai par tha tab tatkaaleen soochna or technology mantri kapil sibbal ne soshal media par kaabo karne kii koshish kii thi, lekin unki yah tadbir ulti pad gai, or sarkaar kii lokapriyata khaasi ghat gai
 It seems that Manish Tiwari, who has run with time, has learned from this and he argues that the government should adopt social media and not drive away

 According to a party MP, "it is not that the Congress has not done enough work for women
" ’’ unka kahana he, ‘‘khud sonia gandhi mahilaon ke liye 33 pratishat aarakshan ko badhaava detii rahi hai
 We passed the bills for domestic violence, succession of women in agricultural property
 samasya yah he ki ye vidheyak jaldbaaji main paarit kar die jate hai

 NDA has announced the name of the current Governor of Bihar Ramnath Kovind as the presidential candidate
 jis tarah se endie ke alaava kai vipakshi dalon ne ramnath kovind kaa samarthan karne kaa bharosa bijepi netritv ko diya he uske baad kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki desh ke agle raashtrapati ramnath kovind hi ho sakate hai
 To announce the name of Ramnath Kovind as the presidential candidate, BJP national president Amit Shah himself held a press conference in which he said many times that Ramnath Kovind came from Dalit society
 uske baad kai mantriyon or bijepi ke netaaon ne 'ramnath kovind dalit varg se aate hai' kaa zikr karte hue media main bayaan or twitor par twit kiye
 With Ramnath Kovind being declared the presidential candidate, it seems that the pair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah has started laying out their electoral strategy for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sutron kii maane to ramnath kovind multah sangh yaa bijepi kii prishthbhumi se nahin aate hai
 He joined the BJP in the early nineties, but even then, choosing him, bypassing many Dalit leaders of the party, surprised everyone inside and outside the party because there are many Dalit leaders in the party whose influence is probably more than Ramnath Kovind Has been on its society and is also in the present
 is faisle se saaf jhalkata he ki chunavi samikarnon ke anusaar vot bank mendlit factorco dhyaan main rakhkar jis tarah se ramnath kovind kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke liye ghoshit kiya gaya he uske baad lagata he ki kahin vot bank raajnneeti ke makadjaal ko bhedane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah kii jodi aane vaale dinon main uparashtrapati chunaav ke liye ummidavaar kaa naam dakshin bharat yaa phir muslim samaaj se naa kar de kyunki in donon hi aria main bijepi kamjor he
 Now the question is that BJP leaders always say that they do not do politics on the basis of religion and on the basis of caste, but what message does the party want to convey by calling the presidential candidate a Dalit
 ek baat to saaf he ki bijepi ab vichaardhaara se nahin idia se chalati he wo bhi chunaav jitaane vaale

 unhone kaha, ‘pehle ve train se hathiyaar bhejte the lekin ab ve sadak maarg se vaahanon se bhejte hai
 When asked why the terrorists would like to take home weapons, the officer said, "the pistol made in Munger is of the standard of modern weapons
" ’ pichley saal dilli police ne munger main bane 130 pistaul baraamad kiye the jabaki is saal 50 se 60 hathiyaar baraamad kiye gaye hai
 According to the police, the three accused arrested last week used to visit Munger often to get consignments of illegal pistols

 But these speculations put a stop to the obnoxious minister saying that there will be no prohibition of liquor in UP
 pradesh ke aabkaari mantri jai pratap singh ne vidhansabha main kaha ki aabkaari vibhaag ke rajasav kaa janakalyaan tathaa vikaas kii anya yojanaon main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Banning of liquor will indirectly boost its illegal sale in the state and people will start buying it from illegal sources
 isse unke swasthya par vipareet asar padegaa
 Thus, it does not seem appropriate to introduce liquor ban in the state in view of wide revenue and public interest

 unhone kaha ki vah sharaab kaa samarthan nahin karte hai lekin is par pabandi lagaana bhi vyaavhaarik rup se sambhav nahin he
 Taking a dig at the former Samajwadi Party SP government in the state, Khanna said, in the event of the kidnapping in the previous government, people used to go to the SP leaders instead of the police to free the kidnapped

 On the issue of Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma, the Samajwarti Party seems to be getting the support of the BJP
 loksabhaa main nepa vipaksh sushamaa swaraj ne bhi maang kii ki benny verma ko mantri pad se hataaya jaae
 The matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee
 Sushma Swaraj said that Beni Prasad Verma's remarks about Mulayam Singh Yadav are objectionable and should be referred to the Privileges Committee
 sushamaa ne kaha ki mulaayam singh yadav sadan ke kaaphi sammanit netaa hai
 Before the uproar over the Beni issue in Parliament, the SP mps again started an uproar over Beni Prasad Verma's controversial statement as soon as the proceedings of Parliament began
 espi supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi congress se sidhe-sidhe puch daalaa ki sarkaar yah bataae ki samarthan ke liye usne kitna paisa diya he?aam chunaav par espi kii najar?espi netaa ramgopal yadav ne yah spasht kar diya he ki upie ko samarthan ke bare main mulaayam singh yadav hi antim faisla karenge
 Party leader Naresh Aggarwal said that elections are expected to be held in October itself
 baharhaal, bijepi ke rukh se upie sarkaar kii musiibat or badhati najar aa rahi he
 The coming together of SP and BJP on the Beni issue is like a alarm bell for the UPA government
 gujarat main congress ke do vidhayakon ke kal die gaye istife ke baad aaj rupani mantrimandal kaa vistaar hoga
 It is expected that three to four ministers will take oath in it
 jinamein jawahar chaawda, yogesh patel or dharmendra singh jadeja ke naam saamne aae hai
 Let the Gujarat Congress face a major setback on Friday when Jawahar Chavda, its MLA from Manavadar district and MLA Purushottam Sabaria, has resigned
 ye donon istife mahaj chah ghanton ke bheetar die gaye
 Jawahar Chavda joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday after resigning
 jabaki, purushottam sabariyaa kaa kahana he ki jab aadesh milegaa tab bijepi main shaamil honge
 Chavda contested assembly elections for the first time in 1990
 kaha jaataa he ki jab gujarat main narendra modi kii vikaas hawa chali thi, tab bhi jawahar chaawda apane bal par congress ke tikat par chunaav jite the
 In such a situation, the effect of Jawahar Chavda joining the BJP will be directly seen in the five Lok Sabha seats of Saurashtra

 Yogesh Patel won the 2017 assembly election from Manjalpur Assembly and became an MLA
 unhone apane najdiki pratidwandi chiraag jhaveri ko 54276 voton se haraaya tha
 At the same time, there was speculation that OBC leader and Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor quit Congress and joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 saath hi kaha ja rahaa tha ki alpesh thakor bijepi main sidhe mantri pad kii shapath bhi lenge
 But no firm statement has come to light in the case so far
 desh main berogari ko badi samasya bataakar jahaan puraa vipaksh modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ko fail qaraar de rahaa he, vahiin rajasthan kaa ek gaanv aisa he, jahaan rojgaar hi barbaadi kaa sabab ban gaya he
 The way of earning a livelihood for the people of Rajwan village, 70 kilometers away from Jodhpur, has made their lungs weak, which has trapped the entire village in a serious disease
 alam ye he ki kai log apni jaan tak ganvaa chuke hai
 Every 5 years, the biggest festival of democracy is celebrated in the country in the form of general elections, in which all the vegetables are shown, but whether those things are implemented on the ground, this question always remains
 rajasthan main loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kii mahakvarej ke dauraan ajtak kii team jodhpur se kareeb 70 kilometre dur rajva gaanv pahunchi, jahaan najar aayaa ki system kii berukhi is gaanv kii takadir ban chuki he
 For decades, his life is bewitching for good days
 silicosis beemaari kii chapet main aae gramingaanv main na pine kaa pani he or na buniyadi suvidhaayen
 The wage employment for livelihood has become deadly
 is gaanv par silicosis naam kii gambhir beemaari kaa prakope he, jisase gaanv ke zyaadaatar purush jujh rahe hai
 In order to run a life, the men of the village do stone cutting work in 'sand stone' mines in the surrounding areas
 lekin khadaan se jo dhul or dhuaan inke fefdon main jaataa he, wo ek gambhir beemaari ko janm de rahaa he
 Alam is that many people of the village have lost their lives while battling this disease
 natthu singh or rajeev jaise yuva silicosis beemaari se peedit hai
 Most of the patients hope that the government will soon provide them financial help for treatment
 polaram ke bete ramesh jaise kai log jindagi ke saath saath maut se bhi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 However, when the owner of the mine Prakash Gehlot was asked why the safety rules were not followed while working in the mine to protect the workers from silicosis, he questioned the workers themselves
 prakaash gahalot kaa kahana he ki uski khadaan main mining kanoon ke tahat har niyam kaa paalan hota he or mazdooron se hameshaa kaha jaataa he ki vah suraksha niyamon kaa paalan karen
 However, where the men of the village are struggling with serious illness, the condition of women is also no less disturbing
 gaanv main ghusane ke pehle hi sadak ke kinare mahilaayein fawda kudaal or tasla lekar banjar jameen par tapate suraj ke neeche mehnat mazdooree karte najar aati hai
 In the name of income, these women have NREGA support under which a project to dig a pond by the road was brought
 15 din ke rojgaar main pratidin 60 se 100 rupee kii kamai hoti he, uske bhugtan kii bhi koi tay taarikh nahin he
 This village has been shown dreams for decades that water will be provided for 24 hours, but even today the dream remains a mere dream
 nal main kabhi pani aayaa to aayaa varanaa 300 se 400 dekar tanker ke jariye pine kaa pani miltaa he
 Every family in this village spends 600 to 800 rupees on a water tanker
 zyaadaatar mahilaayein pani kii kami ko sabase badi samasya maanati hai
 Taps were installed in the village but no water comes
 saptaah main 1 din pani aa jaae to use yah mahilaayein sabase bada sukh maanati hai
 However, there is an election once again
 gaanv phir nikalegaa, vot daalega, ummiido ke sapane sanjoega lekin jo sawaal unke saamne ban kar khadaa he ki kya kabhi unki ummiden puri hongi? kya kabhi unke achche din aaenge? kyonki jodhpur kaa yah gaanv aisa jahaan jindagi bhi sangharsh karti he or maut se bhi sangharsh hota he
 a Mumbai local court has summoned National Award-winning film director Madhur Bhandarkar, rejecting an appeal to quash a rape case
 peedita priti jain ke vakil es
 Kunjurman said on Monday, "the Andheri railway court judge has sent a summons to Madhur Bhandarkar and directed to appear on October 18 and record his statement
" aisa na karne par madhur ko giraftaar kar liya jayega

 pantavane ne balaatkaar evam daraane-dhamkaane ke aarope main bhandarkar ke khilaaf samman jari kiya he
 In 2004, victim Preity Jain accused Madhur Bhandarkar of raping her on the pretext of giving her the lead role in the upcoming film
 priti ko police ne sitambar 2005 main madhur bhandarkar kii hatya ke liye kiraye par hatyara anubandhit karne ke aarope main giraftaar kiya tha
 In January 2006, the police requested the court to quash the case on the grounds that Preity's allegations against Madhur Bhandarkar were found to be false
 kya aapane kabhi suna he ki koi pehle suicide note likh le or marane kaa faisla baad main kare? yaa aap is baat par yakeen karenge ki koi suicide note likhe bhi or use aise chupa kar rakhe ki marane ke teen baad tak kisi ko mili hi nahin? or kamaal ye ki teen din baad vahi suicide note police ko khud wo shaks laakar de, jo khud hi shaq ke ghere main ho
 a suicide note that came out three days after the death of reporter Pooja Tiwari suddenly raised all these questions
 shaq ke ghere main puja kaa suicide notepuja kaa suicide note milane kaa sidhaa sa matlab he ki ye khat marane se pehle likhaa gaya
 This four-page suicide note has been written in English but the language is in Hindi
 chaar main se do pannon par dastakhat hai magar do pannon par nahin
 The full name is written as Pooja - Pooja Tiwari
 par sabase ajeeb baat ye he ki suicide note ke chaaron pannon main se kisi par bhi koi taarikh nahin likhi gai he
 Three days after the death of Pooja Tiwari, who worked as a journalist in the web portal, this suicide note has suddenly appeared
 wo bhi us shaks ke jariye jo khud shaq ke ghere main he
 Inspector Amit of Haryana Police
 puja kaa ye suicide note amit ne buudhvaar shaam ko khud police ko saunpa
 It is worth noting that a person who is going to die, will he hide that suicide note in a bag? Or will place such a place where anyone can easily see
 khaas taur par aisi haalat main jabaki wo khud chaahati he ki uski maut ke liye uske ghar waalon yaa doston ko pareshaan na kiya jaae? phir puja ne suicide note ko aisi jagah kyon chupa kar rakhaa ki wo teen din baad mila? or wo bhi teen din baad khud wo shaks wo note lekar police ke paas pahunchataa he, jisaki taraf in teen dinon main shaq kii sui sabase teji se gumti he
 Not the police, but Amit got the suicide note
 According to Inspector Amit, the bag in which Pooja kept the suicide note also used that bag
 vahi bag lekar wo panchkula chalaa gaya tha
 On Wednesday evening, the suicide note was kept in the bag, after which he handed it over to the police
 ab yahaan sawaal ye khadaa hota he ki puja kii maut ke baad police ne puja kaa sara ghar khangaal daalaa
 But why did the police not get those bags and suicide notes? However, the bag in which Amit is getting the note, is claiming that the bag was in his flat even a day after Pooja's death
 puja ne pehle hi kyon likh liya suicide notesuicide note ko lekar ek or ahm sawaal khadaa hota he
 From the evening of May 1 to late one and a half hours, Pooja was either with Inspector Amit or her friend Amreen was with him
 phir puja ne suicide note kab likhaa? aam taur par suicide karne vaale marane kaa faisla achaanak karte he
 It is not usually that suicide notes are written in advance and decide to die later
 phir maut se mahaj dedh ghante pehle tak puja kii baatcheet se katai aisa nahin lag paha tha wo khudakushi karne ja rahi he
 The police will investigate the handwriting of Pooja, in view of all these questions, the Faridabad Police is currently not saying anything about the truth of the suicide note
 police kaa kahana he ki pehle wo suicide note or puja kii handriting kaa milan karaayegi
 Only after the report comes, it will be decided whether Pooja has written the suicide note or it is some trick to mislead the police
 vaise suicide note dene ke 24 ghante baad hi usee inspector amit ko faridabad police ne giraftaar kar liya he
 The police has arrested Amit under Section 306 of the IPC, that is, a case has been registered for forcing him to commit suicide
 ab sawaal ye he ki agar amit kii vajah se puja ne khudakushi kii to phir suicide note main usne kuch or kyon likhaa he?suicide note likhane ke liye do pen kaa istemaalaye suicide note do alag-alag kalam se likhe gaye hai, kyonki suicide note likhane ke liye do alag-alag rang kii syaahi istemaal kii gai he
 The first page was written with blue ink, then perhaps the ink ran out in the middle, while the rest of the note was written with a second pen, that is, black ink
 maut ke liye nahin koi jimmedaar lekin
 
 
 The suicide note clearly states that no one should be held responsible for Pooja's death
 na ghar waalon ko or na doston ko
 Although writing the name of the doctor couple of Faridabad, action has been written against them in connection with the feticide, but Pooja has not held her responsible for her own death
 puja kii maut ban gai he mistryis suicide note kaa kul labboluab yahi he ki puja jholachhap doctoron ke khilaaf sting oparation karne ke baad se pareshaan thi kyonki ek doctor ne uske khilaaf blakemeling kaa maamla police main darj kara diya tha
 The question here is also about the role of the police in this case
 kya police jaanboojh kar yaa phir doctoron ke dabaav main aakar puja ko pareshaan kar rahi thi? jaahir he sari kahani saamne hote hue bhi puja kii maut kii mistry abhi sulajhani baaki he
 Home Minister of Madhya Pradesh Babulal Gaur has once again given a controversial statement about women
 bijepi karyaalay main yojit ek sammelan main unhone apane rus daure ko yaad karte hue kaha, 'ek baar main rus gaya tha
 At the event where i was to attend, a lady came and kissed me on the forehead
 maine kaha ki yah baat mere yahaan pataa chal gai to meraa ellection kaa tikat cat jayega
 ' 85 saal ke bijepi netaa gaur yaheen nahin ruke
 He narrated another anecdote that went beyond the limits of the joke
 gaur ne bataaya, 'isi sabha main ek sthaneey netaa kii patni mere paas aakar meri dhoti ke bare main poochne lagi ki yah kya pahan rakhaa he? yah bina chen or belt ke kaise baandhte ho? usne kaha mujhe yah baandhna sikhaao to maine kaha, main tumhen dhoti baandhne kii kala sikhaa to saktaa hum, magar akele main
 ' is sabha main sau ke kareeb bijepi kaaryakarta or party samarthak maujuud the, jinhone is kisse ko khaasaa pasand kiya or taaliyaan bhi bajaain
 Let me tell you that Gaur also made a controversial statement in June last year
 unhone rape ko soshal krime bataaya tha or kaha tha ki yah kabhi-kabhi sahi hota he or kabhi-kabhi galat
 Even then, BJP had dismissed this statement as Gaur's personal statement
 iske pehle bhi unhone kaha tha ki dakshin bharat main rape kam isliye hote hai kyonki vahaan kii mahilaayein salike se kapade pahenti hai
 Recalling his Russia tour at a conference held at the BJP office, he said, 'I once went to Russia
 jis kaarykram main mujhe shaamil hona tha, vahaan ek mahila ne aakar mujhe maathe par chuum liya
 i said that if i come to know about it here, then my election ticket will be cut
 ' Gaur, an 85-year-old BJP leader, did not stop here
 unhone ek or kissa sunaaya jo majaak kii hadon ke paar nikal gaya
 Gaur said, 'in this meeting, the wife of a local leader came to me and asked about my dhoti, what is it wearing? How do you tie it without chains and belts? He said, Teach me how to tie it, then i said, i can teach you the art of tying the dhoti, but in private
 ' Nearly a hundred BJP workers and party supporters were present in this meeting, who liked this story very much and also played applause
 aapako bataa den ki gaur ne pichley saal june main bhi ek vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 He called the rape a social crime and said that it is sometimes right and sometimes wrong
 bijepi ne tab bhi is bayaan ko gaur kaa nijee bayaan bataate hue pallaa jhaad liya tha
 Earlier too, he had said that the rapes in South India are less because the women there dress lightly
 85 saal ke bijepi netaa gaur yaheen nahin ruke
 He narrated another anecdote that went beyond the limits of the joke
 gaur ne bataaya, 'isi sabha main ek sthaneey netaa kii patni mere paas aakar meri dhoti ke bare main poochne lagi ki yah kya pahan rakhaa he? yah bina chen or belt ke kaise baandhte ho? usne kaha mujhe yah baandhna sikhaao to maine kaha, main tumhen dhoti baandhne kii kala sikhaa to saktaa hum, magar akele main
 ' is sabha main sau ke kareeb bijepi kaaryakarta or party samarthak maujuud the, jinhone is kisse ko khaasaa pasand kiya or taaliyaan bhi bajaain
