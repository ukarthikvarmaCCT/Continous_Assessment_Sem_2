 The body of God is bound to be left, but we ourselves create a second body - the letter body! Those who find this body strong are not here - around us
 samaajawaadee raajnneetijna, lekhak-vichaarak surendra mohan ke lekhon kaa taaja sankalan vikalp kaa rasta mujhe isi kii yaad karaata rahaa
 Surendra Mohan was one of the few politicians who will always be remembered for his low but meaningful backstage roles on stage
 apane raste aane vaali har tarah kii samasyaon par lagaataar vichaar-vimarsh or har sambhav manch se unako logon ke saamne rakhane kii unki anwarat koshish kaa parinaam he ki aaj hamaare paas unke likhe lekhon kaa samrudh bhandar he
 23 November 2011: See India Today in pictures 16 November 2011: View in Pictures India todayrajkamal publication has compiled 400 pages of selected articles from them
 iske lekhon kaa sankalan-sampadan surendra mohan ne khud kiya-apane jivan kaal kaa sambhawatah aakhri kaam
 In the role, he has written that the cycle of change which started in the Indian economy since 1991 and which continues till today, is representative of all that he wrote and thought in various journals
 unka lekhan aadambaraheen hota tha or ve bagaiyr kisi lambii-chaudee bhoomika ke apni baat sidhe rakh dete the
 He often used to think that look, sir, this is also a window to look at this question
 khidki kholane kaa yah kaam raajnneetijna kaa dharm he, aisi patibaddhta unke jivan main bhi thi or vahi lekhan main bhi utar ai
 Surprisingly, while remaining immersed in daily party politics, he had saved the energy and commitment to keep up with the trend in thought writing
 idhar ke daur main aisa koi doosraa naam mujhe yaad nahin aata-samaajwaadiyon main bhi nahin
 Economy is not a separate thing in itself
 yah samaaj-desh ke bare main aapke soch kaa pratibimb hoti he
 You have to create the kind of society you want to create
 jab aap ek aise samaaj kii kalpana karne main sukh pate hai ki jisamen puunji kii takat sarvopari hogi to arth-rachana main ve saare parivartan karte hai, or usamen ve saare tatv milaate hai jo puunji ko or puunji waalon ko agrim pankti main khadaa karti he or baaki kaa puraa samaaj-desh unki abhyarthna main khadaa kar diya jaataa he
 Since 1991, our political thinking has resulted in the eventual miscarriage of the country which was taken over by the Indian Independence Movement and which Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister had carried forward in his own way
 jab desh ke bare main rajanetaaon kaa sapana hi badal gaya to desh kii arth-rachana ko badalanaa hi tha
 Surendra Mohan makes direct attacks on events in almost every article of this compilation
 berogari, bahurashtriya companiyaan, hinsa, kisaan, panchayat har taraf unki najar he or ve koshish karte hai ki sattadhish apni galatiyon-kamajoriyon ko dekhen-samajhen
 His long experience of practical politics, his background of socialist thinking and his association with all kinds of social movements in the country make his articles unique
 lekin yaheen aakar ye saare lekh thithak bhi jate hai ki vikalp kaa rasta koun-sa he? jo chal rahaa he, unki kamiyon-kamajoriyon kaa vishleshan to thik he lekin agar yah thik nahin he to thik kya he or uske vyaavhaarik kadam kya hai, yah bhi khojna-bataanaa hoga
 There is an intersection, even if the journey to reach it is not easy, but there is no road

 Surendra Mohan brings us to the intersection, does not show the way
 raajnneetigyon, partiyon ke daayre ke baahar ve nikalate hi nahin, isliye aasaan nishkarshon se kaam chalaa lete hai
 Yes, this compilation helps us to understand all kinds of economic-political-social flows of that period

 'film star or patna sahib ke saansad shatrughna sinha ne patna me ashtami ke din alag-alag puja pandal main gum-gum kar puja-archana kii
 Going to different pandals, Bihari continued to offer prayers in Babu Mata's court

 Chunri on head with coconut in hands and duly worshiped

 Bihari Babu, MP from Patna Sahib, took his blessings from his mother in Durgapuja
 maahaul poojamay tha par narendra modi kii raily kii charchaa se achoota nahin rahaa
 Bihari Babu announced that even if Advani does not come, he will stand on the stage in the rally
 darasal shatrughna sinha ne bulaave ke pehle hi khud hi modi ke manch par hone or raily me shirkat kaa elaan kar diya he
 Seeing the wave of Namo mantra in BJP, Shatrughan Sinha sensed the opportunity and made it clear that he was never separate from the party, according to Shatrughan Sinha, he only wanted to announce the name of the Prime Minister through the Parliamentary Board and this is what happened, In such a situation, his displeasure is over

 kaha ja rahaa tha ki bijepi ne mukhyamantri kaa naam ghoshit nahin kar vahi galati doharaai he, jo vah bihar main kar chuki he, or party kaa voton ke liye pradhanmantri par nirbhar hona dikhaata he ki yahaan vaikalpik netritv kaa abhaav he
 
 
 The man says, "we are not worried at all, and the chief minister can choose even later
 
 
 kya hua, agar netritv karne ke liye (narendra) modi yahaan nahin honge
 
 
 The He will choose a reliable person
 
 
 yah bilkul viraat kohli jaisaa hi he - unke saath 10 anya khilaadi bhi hote hai, lekin captain vahi hai

 unhen match jeetna he
 
 
 " cricket ke khel se raajnneetik jang kii yah tulana bijepi ke madhyam darje ke kaaryakarta kii ore se ai thi, jo ilaake main janaa-pahachaanaa shaks he, or bheed jamaa hone par jald hi behad aasaani se pravaktaa kii bhoomika akhriyaar kar saktaa he
 
 
 Other parties say that even in areas where the BJP is not in the fight, its 'speaking' workers also specialize in making such an impression as if it is the most prominent party
 
 
 yah bhi sach he ki kuch ilaakon main dalit jab anya logon se ghire hote hai, kehete hai ki unki pasand 'phool' (bijepi kaa chunaav chihn camel) he, lekin jab unhen alag le jaakar kuch or sawaal kiye jaaen, to kuch kaa daawa he ki ve ab tak 'hathi' (mayawati kii party bahujan samaaj party kaa chunaav chihn) se dur nahin hue hai
 
 
 It is difficult for them to decide which of these two answers they are expected to get
 
 
 yakubganj gaanv main vikaas ke koi chihn dikhaai nahin dete
 
 
 There appears to be only one shop, which is, in fact, a wooden counter, and some toffee cans and gutkas appear on it
 
 
 is dukaan ke maalik ravat (gaiyr-jatav anusuchit jati) danpati hai, or kehete hai, "ham harijan hai
 
 
 Last time we voted for the elephant, but this time it is important for us to support the flower
 
 
 " ve isaki vajah bhi bataate hai, "aap baakiyon ko dekhie
 
 
 All are running after the Muslims
 
 
 hamaare bare main koun sochega
 
 
 The It is a question of religion
 
 
 kya hinduon ko ekajute nahin hona chahie
 
 
 The Must be absolutely
 
 
 " That is the essence of this election
 
 
 akhilesh yadav or congress gathbandhan main hai or unka sara dhyaan muslimon or yadavon kii taraf he, badi sankhya main
 
 
 So, Hindus also feel that this time they should vote on the basis of religion and not on the basis of caste
 
 
 aisi manyata chaaron ore faili hui he ki akhilesh yadav ne muslimon ko phayda pahunchane mahatvapurn nitiyon ko istemaal kiya, or unhone aisa hinduon kii keemat par kiya
 
 
 Apart from this, there is dissatisfaction among the people about converting police stations into Yadav's recruitment center
 
 
 gaanv main based chaar muslim pariwaron main se ek kii sadsy ek mahila ne kaha, "mujhe sirf phool, phool sunai de rahaa he
 
 
 They are all going to vote for them
 
 
 main unhen vot nahin de sakati
 
 
 What can i give? 
 
 ?" is mahila ne 'cycle' (akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party kaa chunaav chihn) ko vot diya he
 
 
 Not given to 'hath' (congress's election symbol), she asks, "what can the paw give us
 
 
 ? cycle hamaare (muslimon ke) liye he
 
 
 " pichley hafte fatehpur main piem modi kii raily main juty bheed The Congress is absent in most such discussions
 
 
 vah zedpur jaise gaanvon main muslimon kii pasand he, yaa raibareli ke kuch ilaakon main uskaa zikr hota he, lekin bas
 
 
 The youth often say, Akhilesh Yadav seems to be doing a good job, but when asked to whom his parents are supporting, a group of school girls say, "modi, Modi
 
 
 " lekin rahul gandhi kaa naam koi nahin le rahaa he
 
 
 Neither youth, nor women, nor old age
 
 
 fatehpur main piem narendra modi kii raily main ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha ki unki reliyon main baari bheed pahunch rahi he (aalochakon kaa kahana he ki bihar main bheed voton main tabdeel nahin hui thi)
 
 
 According to the police officer, Rahul Gandhi is unable to do anything
 
 
 unka kahana tha, "lagata he, unke paas koi yojana nahin he
 
 
 Has he presented any post-election plan to anyone
 
 
 ?" akhilesh or rahul ko sunne ke liye elahabaad main baari bheed juty, is par ek shaks ne kaha, "kya aapako aisi hi bheed dikhi thi, jab rahul gandhi kisaan yatra kar rahe the
 
 
 The If people are coming to see him now, it is because he is with Akhilesh Yadav
 
 
 " Akhilesh Yadav addressing an election rally akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi ke saath aane kii vajah yah manyata rahi ki ek saath aa jane se muslim voton kaa bantwaaraa nahin hoga
 
 
 Proof of this idea is also easily found
 
 
 yakubganj main ek muslim ne kaha, "agar hamen lagata he ki modi acha kaam kar rahe hai or main unhen vot detaa bhi hum, to yahaan ke baaki log yakeen hi nahin karenge ki maine unhen vot diya
 
 
 So why should i vote for him? 
 
 ? mere vot ko katai nazarandaaz kar diya jayega
 
 
 "he told," i got 150 people from my family to vote for the bicycle
 
 
 " vaise is shaks ne apane vichaar ek hindu ke saath baithkar vyakt kiye, or kaha, "yahaan, ham sab miljulkar rahete hai
 
 
 You vote for him, whom you want, i will vote for him, to whom i want
 
 
 koi tension nahin
 
 
 " yahaan shanti bhi kshanbhangur he, jaisaa haal hi main mujaffarnagar main dekhne ko mila tha
 
 
 Due to the presence of many castes, there is danger
 
 
 lekin ar chunaav bhi hindu or muslim ke bich chunaav kii taraf badha, to suraksha kam lagane lagati he
 
 
 The wave flowing inside cannot be completely ignored
 
 
 maahaul is tarah kaa he ki sirf ek bhadakaau, uksaau bhaashan yaa video se hi ek ghadi main hi voton kaa puri tarah dhruvikaran ho saktaa he
 
 
 While the cameras were covering the conversation with the elders of the village, a girl with a bicycle was watching from across the stream
 
 
 usne bataaya ki cycle ke saath use college fees ke naam par 10,000 rupee bhi mili the, jo akhilesh yadav kii shiksha ko protsaahan dene kii yojana ke tahat die gaye the
 
 
 She can't vote right now, but when she can give, "he will be an elephant, just an elephant
" 
 
 unhone (akhilesh ne) bhale hi mujhe cycle di ho, lekin vah bahanji (mayawati) thim, jinhone hamen sammaan diya, jinhone sunishchit kiya ki hamen nazarandaaz nahin kiya jayega
 
 
 Otherwise, what does Dalit get? 
 
 ? kuch bhi nahin
 
 
 " is ladki kii maa bataati he ki gali main ek ghar aisa bhi he, jisamen alpiji kaa silendar he
 
 
 He said, "she (narendra) was sent by Modi
 
 
 hamen nahin mila
 
 
 Maybe, some more may be sent
 
 
 " baharhaal, mahilaon main nishchit rup se garibon ko muft gas silendar dene kii yojana sabase badhiya maani ja rahi he
 
 
 No one talked about Jan Dhan Yojana or zero-balance bank accounts

The answer lies in the politics of Purvanchal, whose leader is Yogi Adityanath, called the 'hindu heart emperor', and Mukhtar Ansari, the 'messiah of Muslims'

 com / i8x7lkznra utyub par motorbike kii naakaam chori kaa ek video achaanak trend karne laga he, jo he to teen saal purana, lekin use haal hi main post kiya gaya he
 
 
 This video has been included in youtube's top trending video, and has been viewed more than 52 lakh times in four days
 
 
 lagbhag teen minute kaa yah video darasal sisitivi footage he, jisamen ek chor dindahaade ghar main ghuskar motorcycle churaakar le jane kii koshish karata dikh rahaa he
 
 
 The attempt was because he was stuck in the 'door', and then when a man from inside the house ran towards him, the thief had to run away to save his life
 
 
 yah video teen saal purana he, yah baat bhi is sisitivi footage par lagi timestamp kii vajah se pataa chal paati he, lekin iske alaava yah ghatana kahaan or kab hui, yah pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 
 
 It is clearly visible in the video that the thief first sits down outside the iron door of the house, and then, by chance, sneaks in and enters, and successfully drags the motorcycle to the door
 
 
 bas, yaheen pahunchakar kismat uskaa saath chhod detii he, or kuch aisa ho jaataa he, jo usne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga
 
 
 While watching the video, where you feel that this motorcycle will be stolen, then the motorcycle gets stuck in the door, and despite millions of efforts of the thief, it does not come out
 
 
 isi dauraan ghar ke bheetar se ek shaks nikalakar baahar aata he, or belcha lekar chor kii taraf daudta he, jiske baad jaan bachaakar bhaagane ke alaava chor ke paas koi rasta nahin rah jaataa
 
 
 The comments video dilachasp he, isamen koi shaq nahin, lekin yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki yah video teen saal baad kyon post kiya gaya, or yah kyon trend kar rahaa he
 
 
 However, if you do not get the answers to all these questions, then there is no harm in its fun, so look at you guys too, and tell us by writing a comment, how did you find this failed theft
