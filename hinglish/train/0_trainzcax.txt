 Gold price in domestic market is around Rs 7,000 per 10 grams Unsharrafa market, compared to last year, on the auspicious time of buying 25 per cent of precious metals, Dhanteras sold around 30 tons of gold this year, which is more than expected
 
 india bullian and jewelers association (ibijee) ke rashtriya sachiv surendra mehta ne yah jaankaree di
 Mehta said that about 40 tonnes of gold was sold in India on Dhanteras during the past years, but this year the price of gold was high and due to lack of liquidity in the market, the buying was expected to be around 20 tonnes
 kaisaa rahaa sone kaa bhavavahin is saal sone kii bikri pichley saal se 25 fisadi kamjor rahi
 This year's gold price is higher by about Rs 7,000 per 10 grams in the domestic market than last year
 sona mahangaa hone ke kaaran kharidari naram rahi he
 He, however, said that a few days ago, there was not even a chance of buying this much, as the yellow metal was seeing weak demand at higher prices in the domestic bullion market
 surendra mehta ne samachar kaa kahana he ki 'antarrashtriya bazaar main sone kaa bhav is saal tej rahane or bharat main mahangi dhaatuon par aayaat shulk bad jane ke kaaran gharelu sarrapha bazaar main daam kaaphi unchaa ho gaya he, jabaki logon ke paas nakadi kaa abhaav he
 Hence, demand for gold was seen to be weak at the beginning of the festive season, but the buying momentum in the last three-four days has led to almost 30 tonnes of gold buying on this Dhanteras
 'sone kii rahi kamjor maangaisse pehle aath oktober main mehta ne kaha tha ki 'kamjor maang ke kaaran is saal lagata he ki dhanteras par deshbhar ke sarrapha bazaar main bamushkil se 20 ton sona bik paaegaa
 Ajay Kedia, director of Kedia Advisory, also estimates that the Indian bullion market has been 25 per cent weaker than last year
 haalanki kedia ne kaha ki piemasi bank main ghotaale ujagar hone ke baad banking skiimon main nivesh ke prati chote niveshkon kaa vishwaas kam hua he, jisase sone or chaandi jaisi mahangi dhaatuon main nivesh ke prati logon kaa rujhaan badha he

 If this happens, the income tax exemption limit of Rs 2

 The party has become more empowered after the overwhelming majority BJP got in UP
 403 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main 325 bijepi vidhayak pahunchaakar upi kii janata ne bijepi ko 'bahubali' bana diya he
 The impact of the massive victory of UP is going to be seen far ahead
 kendra kii modi sarkaar ko ye chunavi parinaam bahut hi majbootee pradaan karne vaale hai
 BJP 'central politics' (rajya Sabha), which has been 'bahubali' on these five fronts, will have about 60 vacancies in the Rajya Sabha by 2018
 khaali hone vaali adhiktar siten upi, uttarakhand or goa se hone vaali hai
 Let us tell you that 11 seats in UP and one each in Goa and Uttarakhand are going to be vacant in Rajya Sabha
 upi kii 11 siton main abhi 7 espi, 2 bispi va ek-ek congress or bijepi ke paas he
 Now BJP will face most of these seats because according to the latest results, BSP, Congress and SP will have to give up their seats
 ye jarur he ki ho saktaa he ki sapa ek yaa do or bispi ek seat par bani rahe
 As soon as the picture of the Rajya Sabha changes next year, the Modi government will find it much easier to move forward on its agenda
 abhi tak rajyasabha main modi sarkaar alpamat main thi jis vajah se uske kai bill paas nahin ho paa rahe the
 Let us tell you that at present the number of UPA in Rajya Sabha is 96 (congress-60, SP-19, JDU-10, DMK-4, RJD-3) while NDA has 70 (BJP-56, TDP-6, Akali Dal-3 , Shiv Sena-3)
 iske alaava modi sarkaar ab desh kaa aglaa raashtrapati or up-raashtrapati apane pasand kaa bhi chun sakati he
 In fact, when it comes to the Electoral College for the presidential election, the vote share of the bjp-led NDA will still be slightly less than the majority, but still it will not be enough that the NDA has to face the UPA
 voton ke antar ko endie ab kisi anya dalon ke saath milakar puraa kar legaa
 Economic reforms: As soon as the BJP is ahead in the strength of the Rajya Sabha, it will now be seen beating hands and feet for rapid economic reforms
 jaahir he ki loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle modi sarkaar har haal main desh kii aarthik vruddhi dahaai ank main laana chaahegi
 The Modi government can do this first thing on subsidy
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki modi sarkaar kai pariyojnaon main di ja rahi sabsidi main katautee yaa ise khatm bhi kar sakati he
 Apart from this, the Modi government may be even more strict on the cashless economy
 sarkaar ke anya bade faislon main benami sampatti or gold monetigeshan skim kii bhi baaten ho rahi hai
 Indirect taxes will be simplified by implementing GST Goods and Service Tax (GST)
 aarthik jaankaron ke mutabik isse desh ko aarthik vikaas main gati milegi
 Some economists do not agree with this, but they also consider it a significant improvement
 ab jab loksabhaa ke saath-saath rajyasabha main endie majboot sankhya bal main hoga to jiesti lagu hona tay he
 Let us tell you that GST is a tax which will get rid of the huge net of tax
 jiesti aane ke baad bahut si chijen sasti ho jaaengi, haalanki kuch jeb par yah baari bhi padegi
 The biggest benefit of GST will be that there will be more than 18 taxes in the country
 iske lagu hone ke baad puure desh main hoga sirf ek tex
 
 
 GST videsh niti(nepal-pakistan-bangladesh par kade faisle)upi-uttarakhand kii badi jeet ke baad bijepi ab desh or videsh kii raajnneeti par focus karegi
 The Modi government will especially try to improve its relations with some neighboring countries
 ummid he ki pakistan ke saath rishton ko behatar karne ke liye modi ek nai shuruyaat kar sakate hai
 Not only this, there may be an attempt to correct the deteriorating relations with Nepal
 ek anya padosi desh bangladesh kii piem shaikh hasina bhi jald hi bharat aaengi
 Modi is to negotiate with them and take steps to further strengthen the relationship between the two countries
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki paanch rajyon ke chunaav or unamem bijepi ke shandaar pradarshan ke baad ab modi sarkaar pakistan ke khilaaf or kadaa ravaiya na apanaate hue uske saath baatcheet kaa silsilaa bhi shuru kar sakati he
 There are also signs of this in the past
 sindhu jal samjhaute par ab bharat kaa rukh badal chukaa he
 Apart from this, now the Modi government can also take a big decision on Bengal refugees
 gauratlab he ki assam, pashchim bengal, upi or bihar main yah bada chunavi mudda he
 For social reforms (triple divorce, modernization of education) Modi government will focus on social reforms just like economic reforms
 is baat kii tasdik ravivaar ko jeet kaa jashn manaane bijepi mukhyalay pahunche pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashan main bhi hui thi
 He had clearly said, "the government is formed by majority but moving is universal
 hamaari sarkaar bhedbhaav ke bina unke liye bhi kaam karegi jinhone hamen vot nahin diya
 "it is expected that the Modi government can now take concrete steps on important issues like triple divorce, common civil code
 iske alaava modi sarkaar bharat main shiksha ke str ko behatar karne ke liye bhi kuch jaruri kadam uthaa sakati he
 The strategy of running big plans like mid-day meal with Aadhaar is indicating something similar
 iske alaava ab vah madrason par bhi focus kar sakati he
 Dr
 sivan ke safalataa vaale bayaan par uth rahe sawalvikram lander ke takanic kii jaanch kii uth rahi maangabhartiya antariksh agency isro (indian Space Research Organisation - ISRO) ke chif dow
 K
 sivan ne kaha tha ki chandrayan-2 mishan main hamen 98% safalataa mili
 He had said that ISRO could not contact Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover
 lekin chandrayan-2 kaa orbitor sahi tareeke se kaam kar rahaa he
 It will keep sending us data and pictures related to the moon for about seven and a half years
 lekin, isro chif ke is bayaan ke baad desh ke kai varisht vaigyanik sivan ke is bayaan par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 a scientist has written an article on leadership of ISRO and rocket science by putting a post on social media
 lander se nahin ho paa rahaa sampark, isro chif bole- ab mishan gaganyan hamaari praathamikataek varisht vaigyanik ne daawa kiya he ki bina gambhir aatmanirikshan ke aisa bayaan dena hamen duniya ke saamne hansi kaa paatr banaata he
 At the same time, according to ISRO sources, Vikram Lander has hit the moon's surface by going much higher than the fixed speed
 ab usase sampark karnaa naammumkin he
 Now he is lost forever
 vaigyanik tapan mishra ne ishaaron main kaha - isro main leadership durlabh ho rahaa heisro chairman ke salaahkaar or spes aplicoshan centre ahmedabad ke purv nideshak tapan mishra ne soshal media par ek lekh likhaa he
 In this, he has questioned the leadership of ISRO without naming ISRO Chief Sivan
 tapan mishra ne likhaa he ki leaders hameshaa prerit karte hai, ve prabandhan (manage) nahin karte
 Let me tell you that soon after Sivan became ISRO Chief, Tapan Mishra was removed from the post of Director of Space Applications Center Ahmedabad
 tapan mishra ne likhaa he ki jab achaanak se niyamon ko maanane kii vyavastha bad jaae, kagaji kaarywahi main ijapha ho jaae, meetings zyada hone lage, ghumaavdaar baaten hone lage to ye maan lenaa chahie ki aapke santhaan main leadership (netritv) ab durlabh hota ja rahaa he
 All possible troubles must be tested before sending the machine to space
 Tapan Mishra further writes that when the tire of your scooter gets punctured on the road, you call a mechanic to fix it
 thik hone ke baad vah phir se chalane lagata he
 So whenever something goes wrong with a spacecraft or rocket, you should not forget the mechanic
 spes science or technology main 100 pratishat bharosa hona behad jaruri he
 Tapan Mishra further writes that whenever you send a machine into space, you have to take many corrective measures
 kyonki antariksh main koi vyakti nahin hota jo gadabadi ko thik kar de
 Before sending that machine to space, you should check the space environment several times
 sabhi sambhavit museebaton ke anusaar us mashin kii jaanch kii jaani chahie
 What kind of reward? Prior to Chandrayaan-2, the government cut the salary of ISRO scientists, Bharat Thakkar, a scientist of Indian origin, said that the design of Vikram lander should be examined
 Have raised theoretical questions
 bharat thakkar ne kaha ki vikram lander ke maikenical dizin ko lekar postmortem karnaa chahie
 It should be found out what arrangements were made regarding safety in Vikram's mechanical design
 kya isapar koi kaam kiya gaya he?dekhen
 
 
 How darkness is approaching isro's 'insane' lying Vikram Lander on the moon! Did it use the same thruster instead of five at the time of landing
 yah technology or aasaan ho sakati thi
 He said that it is a little difficult to operate all five thrusters simultaneously on and on par
 hamen ek hi taqatvar ingine par kaam karnaa chahie tha
 This scientist has alleged that ISRO high officials had sidelined intelligent and experienced scientists working in Chandrayaan-1
 jo log chandrayan-2 project main the hi nahin, ve log chandrayan-2 mishan ke visheshgyon kii team main shaamil hai

 The death of cotton farmers continues due to prolonged exposure to pesticides in Vidarbha region, including Yavatmal district in Maharashtra

 Someday, motorized spray pumps are held responsible

 The India Today team tried to reach reality by going to Ground Zero in Yavatmal district
 is jile main kitnashkon ke prabhaav main aane se 21 kisaanon yaa khetihar mazdooron kii maut ho chuki he
 If we talk about the entire Vidarbha region, 36 people have died since August
 yavatmal ke gavarment medical college main 24 log bhartee hai jinamein se 9 kii haalat najuk bataai gai he
 After all, why this sequence of deaths did not stop? 52-year-old Gajanand Namdev's name in Savarega village of Yavatmal district is also among the 21 people in the district who died due to over-effects of pesticides in the last 3 months
 gajanand ne 1 oktober ko yavatmal medical college main aakhri saans lee

 5 acre ke khet main kapaas kii fasal par kitnashkon kaa chhidkaav kiya tha

 We have antidotes (antidepressants) for some, but some are treated on the basis of symptoms
 samasya tab hoti he jab kisaanon ke sharir ke andar saans ke jariye jahrile rasayanon kaa mishran pahunch jaataa he
 We are advising farmers to use only one type of pesticide instead of the mixture, with all precautions
 swasthya vibhaag aavashyak dishanirdesh jari kar rahaa he lekin kisaan apni fasal ko kiton ke prakope se bachaane ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane ko hataash hai
 Anand Rao, a farmer who grows cotton on a 12-acre farm, says that the crop is facing the kind of pests it has never seen in the last 15 years
 isiilie kisaan apni fasal ko bachaane ke liye tarah-tarah ke kitnashkon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Not only new types of pests, but also the size of the cotton crop is a problem for the farmers
 fasal kii oonchai 6 feet se bhi adhik ja rahi he
 Because of this, pesticides are also being used in large quantities
 kisaan harsh raav kaa kahana he ki pampon se zyada doshi fasal kii oonchai he, jo ki pehali baar dekhi ja rahi he
 Suresh Chinkolkar, director of Maharashtra Cotton Cooperative Association, also blames the quality of seeds brought from neighboring states for such a situation
 chinkolkar kehete hai ki jis tarah kaa keet is baar fasal par hamalaa kar rahaa he, wo pehali baar dekha ja rahaa he
 However, it is certain that farmers have died in Vidarbha due to prolonged effects of pesticides

 a boy committed suicide last night in Teliwada in Delhi's floor Vihar area
 mritak ne aatmahatya ko apane fasebuk pej par live kar diya
 The name of this boy is Shubhankar Chakraborty
 fasebuk pej par is yuvak ko suicide karata dekhakar uske doston ne police ko phone kiya
 This young man wrote the last message on Facebook, i QUIT and then suicide
 police jab maukey par pahunchi to shubhankar ke kamare kaa darwaja andar se band tha
 Police have not received any suicide note from Shubhankar
 shubhankar chakravarti pashchim bengal ke north pargana kaa rahane vaala he
 Shubhankar worked in the Delhi Metro and lived alone in Teliwada
 pisiar kol esai dheer singh ke paas pahunchi
 When Dhir Singh reached the spot, he found the landlord Sanjay Arora and the caller Suryakant Das
 iske baad dheer singh ko sooryakanth das ne puri ghatana ke bare main bataaya
 The deceased was a resident of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal and had been living in Teliwada, Shahdara for the last 2 months
 darwaja andar se band tha
 When the door was broken, the body of Shubhankar was hanging from the fan
 iske baad soochna milte hi krime team bhi maukey par pahunchi
 The crime team has started investigating by taking photos of the incident
 shubhankar kaa mobile bhi kamare kii khidki se mila he
 The crime team has seized everything
 haalanki maukey se koi bhi suicide note nahin mila he
 No one expressed any doubt on Shubhankar's death
 shubhankar ke parijanon ko ghatana kii jaankaree de di gai he
 The statement of Suryakant Das, the caller, has been recorded
 sooryakanth das ne bataaya ki use isaki soochna dost ne di thi, jiske baad usne police ko phone kiya
 Shubhankar was working in the Delhi Metro

 priyanka chopra film 'bharat' se bollywood main kambek kar rahi hai
 After staying busy in Hollywood for some time, Priyanka has shifted to India
 salmaan khan ke saath 'bharat' ke baad priyanka ko ab ek or film mil gai he
 Indianexpress
 com ke mutabik, priyanka filmmekar sonaali bose kii film main farhaan akhtar ke saath najar aaengi
 The website quoted the source as saying - 'the film is based on the life of Ayesha Chaudhary and her book My Little Epiphanies
 priyanka or farhaan, aaysha ke parents ke role main najar aaenge
 In the film, Zaira Wasim will be seen in the role of Ayesha
 film kii shooting is saal agast main shuru hogi
 'priyanka went one step further, also befriending Nick Jonas' father, Ayesha Chaudhary was a motivational speaker who had a disease called pulmonary fibrosis at the age of 13, but that did not dampen her enthusiasm
 bahut kam umr main hi unhone tedx, INK jaise plateform par bolnaa shuru kar diya tha
 At the age of 18, he said goodbye to this world
 varanasi main bijepi ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko raily kii anumati nahin milane par jis tarah kii hai tauba machi, uski koi tarif nahin kii ja sakati
 This was merely an administrative decision which was heavily politicized
 dharna-satyagrah jaise kadam bhi uthaae gaye
 Along with this, tremendous rhetoric was also done
 bijepi ke tamaam netaa ek sur main aalochana karne lage
 All this is justified in democracy, but all these are beyond the scope of decency and harmony and there was no need for them
 ek bayaan maatr se bhi kaam chal saktaa tha
 But perhaps BJP leaders wanted to show strength on this excuse
 unhone yah kiya bhi
 But he hardly got anything from it
 is tarah ke ativaadee or bhavukta purna kadam maahaul ko bigaadte hai
 Varanasi is a unique religious city and the atmosphere here never gets tense, in such a situation what is the message of this groan? What did jp's leaders prove by this? What kind of steps does the party's PM candidate Narendra Modi Does not affect the image of the party? If the party wants to see him as the Prime Minister, then why is he trying to tarnish his image instead of building it now? The stature of Narendra Modi is very large and he has been included in the list of the country's largest political leaders, so what is the need of such an exercise? It seems that the party is confused from somewhere
 aakhir loktantr or bheedtantr main fark to he hi
 Now that the long phase of the election is nearing an end, nothing will get out of such controversies and unnecessary persistence
 ab to jarurat he saamaajik sadbhaav kii, jo is chunaav main dekhne ko nahin mila
 Elections will be over, but it may take months or perhaps years for the spoiled environment to recover
 isliye jaruri he ki is tarah ke jajbaati kadam uthaane kii bajaay party maahaul banane kaa kaam kare
 If he wins the election, it will only work for him
 kisi cheez ko bigaadna to aasaan he, banane main bahut vakt lagata he, khaas kar maanviya rishte

 Once upon a time, a jumla while holding the post of treasurer of Sitaram Kesri, used to hear a lot, 'na khata, na bahi, what Kesari says is right,' but talking about today's BJP, is he able to run his job without treasurer? Shah did not choose the treasurer Actually, in 2014, NDA government was formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then Rajnath Singh took charge as Home Minister
 isse pehle tak rajnath singhbijepike rashtriya adhyaksh the
 After becoming Home Minister, Rajnath Singh resigned as BJP President

 Surprisingly, for a party which is earning Rs 1,034 crore in a year, who is collecting funds without a treasurer? How has the Election Commission been accepting bjp's audit report for the last three years? Election Commission can ask for the report 'aaj Tak' spoke to former Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi on this subject
 unka is vishay par kahana tha ki audit report ek mahatvapurn dastavej hai isliye us par party ke kisi jimmedaar padaadhikari ke hastakshar hone chahie
 According to Qureshi, the Election Commission can ask the concerned party for detailed information about the person who has filed and certified the audit report
 agar chunaav ayog ko koi gadabadi lagati he to wo sambandhit party ke khilaaf karrwai bhi kar saktaa he
 At the same time, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said that the audit report of the leader is signed by the leader who is authorized by the party president
 ye hastakshar party kii taraf se hi hote hai
 Shahnawaz claimed that BJP is a rule-driven party and its record is clean

 pravaal or randeep ek saath ramgopal verma ke antargat kaam kiya karte the
 Then later coral made films such as 'darna Mana Hai', 'darna Necessary' and '404'
 ab kukhyat apradhi 'charles shobhraj' ke jivan ke hisson par aadhaarit film'main or charles'banaai he
 The film was narrated by Amod Kant, who was the Police Commissioner in the 80s, who has been screened by coral
 pravaal ne amod kaant kii samajasevi sanstha 'prayaas' ke liye kai promotional video bhi banaae hai
 Will this film succeed in entertaining the audience? Let us review the film
 kahaneeyah kahani he 80 ke dashak ke 'bikini killer' kahe jane vaale 'charles (randeep hooda) kii, jo logon ko thagta he or ladakiyon kaa katl bhi karata he
 He also managed to escape by tricking the policemen from Tihar Jail, one of the famous jails of India and is eventually caught
 police kamishnar amod kaant (adil hossain) or charles ke bich chor police vaala maajaraa chalata rahata he
 Also, Meera (richa Chadha) and other artists also become eyewitnesses of Charles' journey
 scriptfilm kii kahani asal jindagi ke aadhaar par hone ke saath-saath thodi kaalpanik banane kii koshish bhi kii gai he
 So that the flavor gets right to the audience
 pravaal ne amod kaant se suni kahani ko script kaa rup dekar thik thaak film banaai he
 The screenplay of the film is quite loose which could have been further crisped
 trailor ko dekhakar lagata tha ki film ke samvaad or umdaa honge lekin aisa kuch bhi nahin hua or dialog fike se rah gaye
 In terms of concept, the film could have been made even better
 kaaphi dhimi film he lekinshootingaloketions jaise thailand, goa or dilli ko achche andaaj main pravaal ne dikhaaya he
 Acting actor Randeep Hoodaki has to act as well as his manner of speaking
 jis tarah se unhone charles kii sabase badi aadat logon se ghul milakar unke jaisaa ho jane ko parde par nibhaayaa he
 Also, the character of Adil Hussain is also quite comfortable
 jise dekhakar lagata he ki charles ke saath muqabla baraabar kaa he
 Richa Chadha, Tisca Chopra and other artists have done commendable work
 sangitafilm kaa sangeet 60 -70 ke dashak ke hisaab se rakhaa gaya he lekin 'jab chhaae meraa jaadu' geet sabase behatar he
 Weak Link The weak link of the film is its pace and script, which could have been even more crisp
 isaki vajah se achche kalakaar hone ke baavjood film umdaa nahin ho saki he
 Why see Randeep Hooda's fans, then definitely watch this film
 20 saal puraane kaala hiran shikaar maamle main aaj jodhpur kii sijim court ne salmaan khan ko doshi qaraar diya tha
 The remaining accused are acquitted Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Dushyant
 ye bahut dilachasp maamla he
 There are all kinds of confusions about the case
 ham ek-ek kar aise sawaalon ke jawaab de rahe hai jo puche ja rahe hai
 What are the cases against Salman Khan in the hunting case? - The case of hunting two chinkaras in Bhavad, Rajasthan - Case of hunting of chinkara in horse form of Rajasthan - Case of hunting of two black deer in Kankani village - Fourth case What kind of allegations were made against Haselmann against other artists for keeping the rifle even after the license expired under the Arms Act? In addition to Salman, the film 'hum Saath Saath' The rest of the starcast has also registered a case of black deer hunting
 inamen sonaali bendre, saf ali khan, tabboo or neelam shaamil thi
 All are now acquitted
 kaala hiran cese: 20 saal main itani badali salmaan samet sabhi aropiyon kii jindagiaj salmaan ke maamle main kis cese par faisla liya gaya?aaj vaala cese kaale hiran ke shikaar se judaa hua he
 In which the CGM Court of Jodhpur gave a decision against the accused
 kaale hiran kaa maamla kab or kahaan kaa he?ye maamla sitambar or oktober 1998 main jodhpur main hua
 During the shooting of the film Hum Saath Saath Hai, a case of hunting black deer was registered against the film's starcast 
 kisne salmaan or baaki kalakaaron ko kiya tha giraftaar?bishnoi community kii shikaayat ke baad posted afasar lalit bora ne salmaan khan ko giraftaar kiya
 On the night of Salman before the verdict, the rest of the Bishnoi community complained against Salman, who was restless and sitting on the poolside? The people of Bishnoi community count black deer in the extinct species and are concerned about their conservation
 isliye is samudaay ne salmaan kii shikaayat kii
 What is update in Chinkara case? Salman Khan in Chinkara case was acquitted by Rajasthan High Court in July 2016
 un par wildlife protection act kii dhara 51 ke tahat aarope laga tha
 At present, the state government has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision
 chinkaara ko maarna gaiyrkanoonee kyon he?chinkaara jaanwaron kii ek durlabh prajati he
 It is illegal to hunt chinkara under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972
 kya salmaan khan chinkaara cese main kabhi jail gaye hai?trial cese ne 2006 main salmaan par 5 saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 But after spending 5 days in jail, Salman got bail and after some time he was acquitted of the case
 philhal faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt ne supreme court main apil kii he
 What was the plea of the girl, who had entered the Salman's apartment with a 6 feet high wall? Salman said in court that she was innocent and she was implicated in the case
 iske alaava unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki porest deparment popularti hasil karne ke liye is maamle main unako jabardastee fansaa rahaa he
 What happened to Salman in the Arms Act case? Salman was acquitted in this case due to weak evidence
 is maamle main doshi paae jane ke baad salmaan ke saath kya hoga ?wildlife protection act kii dhara 51 ke tahat 5 saal kii jail or 10 hajaar rupee jurmaane kii sajaa mili he
 Salman has been arrested and sent to jail
 ho sakati he or 25000 rupye kaa jurmaana bhi lag saktaa he
 However, they can appeal against the decision of the CGM Court in the Upper Court
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra uttar pradesh ke varanasi main nirmaanadhin fliover kaa ek hissaa girane se bada haadasa hua he
 According to the information so far, 15 people have died and a large number of people have been injured
 lekin in sabake bich ek chaunkaane vaali baat saamne ai he
 According to the information, there have been questions from the beginning about the design of this under-construction flyover
 is fliover project ko 2 march, 2015 ko ijaajat mili thi
 a budget of Rs 77 crore 41 lakh was passed for this 1710 meter long flyover
 25 oktober, 2015 se is fliover ke nirmaan kaa kaam shuru hua tha
 It is being told that the construction of this flyover was going on for a long time
 haal hi main up-mukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ne varanasi daure ke dauraan is fliover kaa nirmaan jald se jald puraa karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Most of the flyover construction work has been completed and now the last phase work was in progress
 lekin is bich sthaneey logon se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki fliover ke nirmaan main dheron aniyamitataayen barti ja rahi thim
 The work being done in haste, a local person said in a complaining tone that every work is being done in haste
 jo pillar bithaaya ja rahaa he, unhen aapas main pehle joda nahin ja rahaa
 This incident would not have happened if the construction work proceeded
 pichley saal hi dizin ko lekar uthe the sawalabataya ja rahaa he ki is nirmaanadhin pul ke dizin ko lekar july, 2017 main hi sawaal kiye gaye the
 It has been said that the design of the flyover has been made such that it has become a problem for heavy vehicles
 kaint railway stesan ke paas hi sthit roadways bas stesan ke najadik is fliover kaa nirmaan shuru hua to pillar par lage slab kisi baari vaahan kii takkar se hill gaye the
 Officers tried to hide the flaw, the permanent diagnosis of fixing these pillars shaken by the collision of the officers was not understood
 phir upi rajya sethu nigam ke afasaron ne is khami ko chhipaane ke liye barier lagaakar baari vaahanon ke pravesh par roak laga di thi
 In fact, the initially four slabs started moving due to heavy vehicles colliding
 jataai ja rahi thi yah ashankatbhi se yah ashanka jataai ja rahi thi ki jab fliover ke neeche kii sadak banegi to uski oonchai bad jaaegi
 In such a situation, the slab was expected to be damaged again after the heavy vehicle passed under the flyover
 nirmaan kaary puraa karne kii avadhi ghatai gaibataya ja rahaa he ki is fliover kaa nirmaan kaary puraa karne kii avadhi pehle disambar, 2018 nirdhaarit thi
 But this was later reduced to March 2018
 lekin ekbar phir iske nirmaan kii miyaad badha di gai

 During the months in which the whole of India is suffering from terrible heat, the place gets colder

 It is believed that only the cold air comes from these idols, which does not allow the atmosphere here to stay warm
 jab mandir ke daravaaje band kar die jate hai to in hawaaon se andar bahut thandak ho jaati he
 Many times there is so much cold here that the priests have to cover the blanket while there is so much heat outside the temple that in 5 minutes you can get completely drenched with sweat and it can be sunny
 garmi main bhi is mandir main thandak bane rahane ke chamatkaar ke rahasy kaa sahi kaaran abhi tak koi nahin jaan paaya he

 The Reserve Bank of India will give 1 lakh 76 thousand 51 crore to the Government of India
 yah paisa rigerv bank kii aakasmik nidhi or sarplus kaa he jise angrezi main contigency fund kehete hai
 The Reserve Bank of India comes into its present form in 1949, and ever since then till date, so much money has never gone from the Reserve Bank to the Government of India
 china ke saath yuddh ke vakt rigerv bank kii aakasmik nidhi se paisa liya gaya tha, lekin yah paisa he uske bare main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki yah arabiai ke itihaas main pehali baar he jab itnaa paisa aakasmik nidhi se nikaal kar sarkaar ko dene kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 Anyway, it was expected in this year's budget that the Reserve Bank will get 90,000 thousand crore rupees, but more than that 86000 crore rupees will be coming
 matlab sarkaar ne jitna maanga usase bhi adhik
 Let's see the account of this century
 2004 se 2014 ke bich ausatan 20,000 karod die gaye
 Between 2015 and 2019, an average of 54,000 crores were given
 2019-20 yani akele is ek vitt virsh main 1,76,000 karod die jaaenge
 In 1991, when Chandrashekhar was the Prime Minister, there was a foreign exchange crisis
 bharat ke paas sirf 15 dinon ke aayaat ke liye paisa tha, tab bhartiya reserve bank ke paas rakhaa hua 47 ton sona, bank of england ke paas girvee rakhaa gaya tha
 Can we compare that situation, i do not have a concrete answer
 kya aaj koi alag sthiti he jise samajhane kii zarurat he to ham prayaas kar sakate hai
 The money that the Reserve Bank of India will give from its two accounts
 1,23,414 karod rupaya aakasmik nidhi se diya jayega
 a surplus of Rs 52,637 crore will be given from Surplus Fund
 bimal jalaan cameti ne ek haftaa pehle hi kuch suzav diya or jaldi hi saare suzav maan liye gaye
 The Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India has decided to transfer a quarter of a million rupees
 disambar 2018 main bimal jalaan ke netritv main cameti bani thi jiske ek sadsy subhash chand garg ne asahmati jataai thi or sin karne se inkaar kar diya gaya
 Garg was transferred to another ministry and Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar replaced him as a new member and after that everyone agreed to the committee's decision
 bhartiya reserve bank ne lambii chaudee press release jari kii he
 It states that before the Reserve Bank of India reached this decision, the risk of the Reserve Bank of the world was studied
 yah bhi dekha gaya ki kitna paisa reserve bank main rakhaa janaa chahie tab jaakar faisla liya gaya
 The Reserve Bank reserves money for two types of situations
 maudrik sankat ke samay or doosraa vittiya sankat ke samay
 The definition of both crises is different
 bimal jalaan cameti ne bataaya he ki aakasmik nidhi kitni ho
 6 of the Reserve Bank's balance sheet
 5 se 5
 Can be kept in the range of 5 percent
 rigerv bank ne neutnam range ko apane liye sweekaar kar liya
 No maximum
 is cameti ke pehle rigerv bank kii aakasmik nidhi 6
 Used to be 8 percent
 balance shit ke hisaab se reserve kaa pratishat upar neeche hota rahaa he
 Did the Jalan Committee help the Reserve Bank by giving minimum range
 bharat ke purv mukhya sankhyikee adhikari pranab sen kaa kahana he ki nunatam range ke kaaran ab reserve bank ke paas koi scope nahin bachaa he
 The coming governments or this government will continue to emphasize the minimum range in the coming times
 aap jaanate hai ki reserve bank ko is nattejey par pahunchane se pehle iske virodh ke kai daur se guzaranaa padaa he
 Governor Urjit Patel refused to give the reserve money and left his post prematurely
 vyaktigat kaarnon se
 In November 2018, Sunny Verma of Indian Express reported that the Reserve Bank has refused to give 3 lakh 60,000 crore to the government
 tab sawaal uthaa tha ki sarkaar rigerv bank kii swaittata par hamalaa kar rahi he tab sarkaar ne kaha tha ki maujuuda niyam rudhiwaadi soch ke aadhaar par bane hai
 The government and the Reserve Bank should work together to find a way out 9
 56 lakh karod ke sarplus kaa kaise istamaal ho
 This view was most strongly opposed by Deputy Governor Viral Acharya
 baad main unhone apane pad se istipha de diya
 In October 2018, Viral Acharya said that the Argentine government also wanted to take over the Treasury of the Reserve Bank
 vahaan ke governor ne virodh main istipha de diya or vahaan tabaahi aa gai
 The plan the government is making is like a T20 match, but the Reserve Bank plans ahead thinking ahead
 viral acharya ke bayaan ke baad purv governor raghuram rajan ne sienbisi channel kii ankar lata venkatesh se kaha tha ki sarkaar ko reserve bank par haath daalane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chahie, yah arthvyavastha ke liye acha nahin he
 If you give your reserve to the government, India's rating comes down
 ham kyon nahin is reserve ko bachaakar rakh sakate hai
 Raghuram Rajan says that to pay additional dividend to the government, the Reserve Bank will have to create additional permanent reserves such as printing more notes
 yani jitna denge utana aapako laana hoga
 He said that every year we take care of how much the permanent reserves are increasing, how much cash is needed in the economy and what is the target of inflation, but former Governor d Subbarao argued that the central bank had its fears Start to see a little too much
 sarkaar or rigerv bank milakar rasta nikaal sakate hai
 Former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said in the Economic Survey that there is no specific reason why the Reserve Bank should not give its surplus to the government
 maujuuda str par hi reserve bank ke paas kaaphi puunji he
 One of the most capital intensive banks in the world
 agar reserve bank 4 lakh karod lautaa de to uskaa kai tareeke se istemaal ho saktaa he
 Here we want to remind you of one thing
 shrinivasana jain ne 9 july 2019 ko enditivi dot com par ek lekh likhaa
 It said that there was a big difference between the actual income that the government had said in the economic survey and the estimate it had said in the budget
 2018-19 ke bajet main 17
 An estimate of earning of 3 lakh crores was reported
 aarthik survey main sarkaar ne apni kamai 15
 6 lakh crores
 yani 1
 Where did the 70 lakh crore account go? yah sawaal pradhanmantri ke aarthik salaahkaar parishad ke sadsy rathin roy ne hi uthaaya tha
 Many circles were concerned about this difference
 kya rigerv bank kaa paisa usee kii bharpai karegaa? sarkaar is paise kaa kahaan istemaal karegi, vahi jaanati he
 Will she make up for the financial loss or other items
 rigerv bank ke purv nideshak vipin malik se himanshu shekhar ne baat kii
 They say that this money should be used for capital investment
 bainkon ko majboot karne main taaki ve adhik se adhik karz de sake
 The opposition did not like it
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki reserve bank kii swaittata par hamalaa to he hi, yah kadam bataata he ki bharat kii aarthik sthati bahut karaab he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister do not understand how to solve the economic tragedy which has created itself
 reserve bank se paise lene se kaam nahin chalegaa, yah goli se lage ghaav par dispenceri se band aid churaakar lagane jaisaa he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman responded to this by saying that the public has given an accurate answer to their thief
 unki parvaah nahin he
 The Finance Minister has said that it cannot tell how the money from the Reserve Bank will be used
 Until 2013, some percentage of the surplus the Reserve Bank earned was deposited in the contingency fund
 2010 se 2013 ke bich 32 se 45 pratishat ke bich jamaa hota tha, lekin 2013 ke baad puraa kaa puraa sarplus sarkaar ko de diya gaya
 Not credited to contingency fund
 2016-2017 se dobaaraa jamaa hona shuru hua, lekin ab sarplus kaa maatr 6 se 7 pratishat hi aakasmik yani immergency fund main jamaa ho rahaa he

 Being part of Team India is my biggest inspiration
 'dhoni ne kaha ki har kisi ko desh ke liye khilne kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 You must have seen many cricketers who did not have any special talent, but still they went much further
 khel ke prati junun kii vajah se aisa hua he
 Dhoni said, "I have always believed that the result is an important process
 maine kabhi bhi parinaam ke bare main nahin sochaa, maine hameshaa yahi sochaa ki us samay kya karnaa thik hoga, bhale hi tab 10 ran kii jarurat ho, 14 ran kii jarurat ho yaa phir paanch ran kii jarurat ho
 'I was so involved in this process and i never took the burden of what would happen if the results were not according to me

 It was not enough when the Indian team was chasing big scores
 'lakshmana ne kaha tha, ki 'mujhe lagata he ki samay aa gaya he ki dhoni tii-20 formet main kisi yuva khilaadi ke liye jagah khaali karen
 Commentator Aakash Chopra had said that in the T20 series against Sri Lanka, another player should be chosen in place of Dhoni, as India have to go on a challenging tour of South Africa

 It is undoubtedly late to start bullet trains in India but low speed domestic bullet trains will start running later this year
 ek website ke mutabik railway agle ek saal ke bheetar desi bullate train chalaane ja rahi he
 Their average speed will be 130 kilometers per hour
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki yah rajdhani or shatabdi jaisi tej trainon se bhi tej hongi
 These trains will cover a distance of 266 km from Delhi to Chandigarh in just two hours
 is samay is root kii sabase tej train shatabdi express ko yah duuri puri karne main 3 ghante 20 minute lagate hai
 Initially, these trains will run on three routes
 ye hai-dilli-chandigarh, dilli-lakhanu or dilli-bhopal

5 crore per km, while the cost of making the tracks of the real bullet train is Rs 200 per km

 iske liye ham system ko apgrade kar rahe hai

 Questioning the cycle of hope, he fed the flowers of hope for the SP in the public's mind and got such a strong mandate which he has not had any luck till date
 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) pramukh mayawati 39 saal kii umr main uttar pradesh kii sabase yuva mukhyamantri bani thim
 sp's young face Akhilesh Yadav (38), who played the most important role in defeating the BSP in the elections for the 16th Assembly, will now break Mayawati's record by becoming the Chief Minister in the lowest
 sapa vidhayak dal ke netaa chune gaye akhilesh yadav kii 15 march ko tajposhi honi he
 Akhilesh was born on 1 July 1973
 malti or mulaayam singh yadav ke putr akhilesh kii schuli padhai dhaulpur (rajasthan) ke sainik skool main hui
 He then studied civil engineering from JC Engineering College, Mysore
 mysore ke baad akhilesh paryaavaran ejineering kii padhai ke liye australia chale gaye
 But when he returned, he got more involved in social engineering than Uttar Pradesh, not civil engineering
 12 saal pehle 26 saal ke akhilesh ne jab sakriy raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa tha to vah mahaj ek sharmile noujvaan the
 Akhilesh, who reached the Lok Sabha for the first time after winning the by-election from Kannauj in 2000, also won this seat in 2004 and 2009
 teen saal pehle firozabad sansadeey kshetra main hue upachunaav main jab unki patni dimple yadav ko congress ke ummidavaar raaj babbar ne haraa diya to unhen or unki party ko ek bada jhatka laga tha
 Akhilesh won the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Kannauj as well as Ferozabad from where he resigned
 is haar kaa sira kahin na kahin 2007 main uttar pradesh kii satta se party kii badnaam vidaai se bhi judaa tha
 But Akhilesh had decided that he would change the face of SP
 is bich mulaayam ne akhilesh ko pradesh sanghathan kii kaman saunpte hue pradesh adhyaksh niyukt kar diya
 Along with Akhilesh on the road to fight against the BSP government, the youth did not shy away from eating the police sticks
 kalyaan singh se dosti todi gai
 Badbole Amar Singh was thrown out of the party
 yahi nahin, chunaav ke pehle jab ajam khan or shivpal yadav jaise party diggajon ne bahubali deepi yadav or mukhtaar ansaari ko party main shaamil karne kaa prayaas kiya to akhilesh ne kadaa virodh kiya
 Says political analyst Ramesh Dixit, "stamping young and well-educated youth like Abhishek Mishra and Akhilesh's tough stance on the entry of mafias into the party made it clear how serious he is about changing the party's image
" is ek faisle ne logon ko unke bare main gambheertha se sochane ko majaboor kar diya
 " computer or angreji virdohi party kii chhavi todakar muft laptop dene jaise elaan or krantirath yatra ke jariye puure soobe main samaajwaad kaa sandesh lekar logon tak pahunchane main akhilesh ne koi kasar nahin chodi
 SP Yuvjan Sabha president Sunil Singh says, "tipu Bhaiya (akhilesh) did not climb up his arm during the campaign nor made any personal remarks on any leader
 bas saadagi se apni baaten rakhkar logon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki is baar mauka mila to sapa puraani galati nahin karegi
 " yadav kehete hai ki blike beri or ypad jaise atyaadhunik gajet ke shaukeen akhilesh dharapravaah angreji bol sakate hai, lekin saarvajanik jivan main shaayad hi kabhi angreji bolte hon
 He did not want to miss any opportunity to communicate with the general public
 tippaniyan Akhilesh himself often says that English has been made the language of honor today
 hindi or urdu ab garibon kii bhashaa ho gai he
 The simplicity and hard work of Akhilesh brought the flowers of hope for SP in the public's mind, due to which the party got the opportunity to form government in the state on its own for the first time in history
 ye aisi kamyaabi he jo dhartiputra kahe jane vaale mulaayam ke hisse kabhi nahin ai
 He too believes that Akhilesh is behind the fulfillment of this dream
 ummid kii cycle par sawaal hokar usne janata ke man main sapa ke liye ummiido ke phool khilaae or aisa prachand janadesh dilaayaa jo use aaj tak naseeb nahin hua
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati became the youngest Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh at the age of 39

 Akhilesh Yadav, elected leader of the SP Legislature Party, is to be crowned on March 15
 akhilesh kaa janm 1 july 1973 ko hua
 Akhilesh, son of Malti and Mulayam Singh Yadav, did his schooling at Sainik School in Dholpur (rajasthan)
 uske baad unhone mysore ke jesi ejineering college se civil ejineering kii padhai kii
 After Mysore, Akhilesh moved to Australia to study environmental engineering
 lekin jab lautakar aae to unhen civil ejineering nahin, uttar pradesh kii soshal ejineering main uljhi raajnneeti hi zyada bhaayi
 12 years ago, when 26-year-old Akhilesh stepped into active politics, he was just a shy young man
 san 2000 main kannauj se upachunaav jitkar pehali baar loksabhaa pahunche akhilesh ne 2004 or 2009 main bhi is seat par jeet darj kii
 He and his party suffered a major setback when their wife Dimple Yadav was defeated by Congress candidate Raj Babbar in a by-election in Firozabad parliamentary constituency three years ago

 Cricket fans still remember morey-miandad's 'fight' during the 1992 World Cup match between India and Pakistan on March 4

 What happened in that match? What did Kiran More make repeated appeals against Miandad in a match in Sydney, Miandad got angry

 Who can understand this better than Akhilesh Yadav, who emerged as a youth icon of clean politics during the assembly elections
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle sharaab vyapaaree or bahubali netaa di
 P
 yadav ko party main shaamil karne se inkaar kar akhilesh yadav ne ek badi lakeer khinch di thi
 He also clashed with the old leaders of the party for doing so
 ipad or blueberi se samvaad karte akhilesh yadav aadhunik soch vaale parishkrut yuva netaa kii image banane main safal rahe
 But the faster the image and symbol are created in politics, the faster it gets scattered
 aapraadhik or bhrasht netaaon se parhez karne vaale akhilesh yadav ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad ek aisa faisla kiya, jisaki dhamak pradesh or desh kii raajnneeti main lambey samay tak sunai degi
 This decision was to make Raja Bhaiya a prison minister
 bataur nirdaleey jitkar aae raghuraaj pratap singh yani raja bhaiya ke sarkaar main hone yaa na hone se vidhansabha main sapa ke bahumat par koi fark nahin padataa
 The SP has 224 mlas in the 403-member state assembly
 lekin akhilesh yadav ne tay kiya ki ve raja bhaiya ko na sirf cabinet mantri banaaenge balki unhen karagaar (jail) jaisaa vibhaag bhi denge
 This decision has also shocked Akhilesh's fans, given Raja Bhaiya's past
 raja bhaiya koi pehali baar mantri nahin rahe hai
 He was also a minister in the previous Samajwadi Party (SP) government
 lekin ab jabaki desh bhar main saaf-suthri raajnneeti kii chahat badi he or akhilesh ko aisi raajnneeti ke pratik ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, to unase ummiden bad jaati hai
 However, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that no court has convicted Raja Bhaiya
 ’ sapa kii yah safai us bhartiya madhyavarg ke aasaani se gale nahin utregi jisane akhilesh ke rup main ek saumy or aadhunik netaa ko dekhne kii tamanna paal rakhi he
 With the party getting a majority in the Assembly elections on 6 March, the new progressive image of the SP created during the campaign went into the background
 sapa kaaryakartaaon ke jashn ne kai gharon ke chiraag buja die or dalit bastiyon main matam chaa gaya
 Since then, almost every day in the state, there was news of harassment to the common people from the activists who persecuted the Dalits, beaten up the opponents and somewhere
 pradesh main gundaraj kii vaapasi kaa andeshaa sahi hota dikhne laga
 The new Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav warned the party workers but seeing the situation not getting better, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had to leave the budget session and stay in Lucknow and also had to warn him not to 'cross Laxman Rekha'
 lekin araajaktaa or anushaasanheenata kaa strot akasar nichle kaaryakartaaon ke bich nahin, balki shikhar par hota he
 Workers often hold up signs
 raja bhaiya ko mantri pad sheersh netritv ne hi diya he
 He has eight criminal cases, including five serious cases of attempt to murder, kidnapping for murder, robbery, and has spent more than two years behind bars in the past decade

 Ever since the announcement of his becoming a minister, the social networking site and the journals 'site sparked backlash:' Koli (accused of Nithari incident) is going to be removed from jail to be made the child welfare minister
 
 
 bhaiya bhae kotwaal ab dar kaahe kaa
 
 
 When power is in the wrong hands, the jail also becomes home for the minister
 
 
 acha he, aakhir jail or aparaadhiyon kii samaj raja se behatar kiski hogi
 
 
 After all, jail is his home and the culprit is his brother
 
 
 junior mulaayam, bahut samajhadaribhara faisla he
 
 
 As if from the newspaper headlines and the comments on the website, the made-up image of Akhilesh was washed away in a jolt
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf desh bhar main abhiyaan chalaa rahi team anna kii sadsy kiran bedi ne twit kiyah ‘uttar pradesh ke jail mantri kaa aparaadh record kaaphi bada he

 'and then i blabbed the question,' Then why two kinds of rules? Character certificate for common citizens and not for minister? ' Bedi replied, "if the jail minister of UP is given a place to work in view of his crime record, he will be called a 'jeld Minister'
" ’samaaj ke vibhinn tabake ne raja bhaiya ko karagaar mantri banane kii jamkar aalochana kii

 In 2003, there were a total of 76 cases against Raja Bhaiya and his father Uday Pratap Singh, including the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA)
 unamem se kai maamalon ko mulaayam sarkaar ne waapas le liya tha
 But as soon as BSP came to power in 2007, Raja Bhaiyya once again came under target
 raja bhaiya ne vibhinn maamalon main 26 maheene jail kii sajaa kaati
 Chief Minister Akhilesh says, "if anyone investigates the cases registered against Raja Bhaiya, then he will know who is behind him
 ’ philhal, raja bhaiya ke khilaaf aath maamle hai jinamein paanch dakaiti, hatya kaa prayaas, hatya ke liye apharan or gambhir rup se ghayal karne ke maamle hai
 If they are found guilty in any of these cases, then the jail minister of Uttar Pradesh may have to spend entire life in jail for seven years

 He says, 'you will believe that a robbery of stealing pot on me and supporters and Rs 20,000
 kii dakaiti daalane kaa mukadmaa darj hua tha
 'but he has so much dominance in Raja Bhaiya's area that even the candidates who beat him in the elections are not ready to speak anything directly

 Local BSP leader Prabudh Tiwari says, 'people's mind has been' captured 'here

 No matter how the family has been accused, the police never dared to enter the palace
 aisa nahin he ki mulaayam singh shuru se hi raja bhaiya ke sangrakshak rahe hai
 In 1989, for the first time under Mulayam's first Chief Minister, a case of attempt to murder was registered against Raja Bhaiya
 bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri kalyaan singh ne unhen 'kunda kaa gunda' qaraar diya tha
 In fact, Mayawati campaigned against Raja Bhaiya and his family, conveying the message of 'thakur oppression' to the Dalits
 'utpeedit' thakur samudaay ne paaya ki bhaajapa or congress ne unka saath nahin diya
 In such a situation, bsp's arch rival SP extended his hand towards them
 jab raja bhaiya pota ke tahat jail main band hue to sapa kaaryakartaaon ne pradesh bhar main dharna-pradarshan kiya
 Mulayam Singh probably realized the usefulness of Raja Bhaiya in the coming days
 2007 se sapa ne kunda vidhansabha se nirdaleey chunaav ladane vaale raja bhaiya ke khilaaf apana pratyaashee utaarna band kar diya
 However, Mulayam Singh's two daughters-in-law Dimple, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh and aparna-thakur, wife of his brother Prateek, are from the family
 lekin sapa se amar singh kii vidaai ke baad party ke paas thakuron ko lubhaane vaala cheharaa nahin tha
 In such a situation, Raja Bhaiya was considered the most powerful Thakur face
 lekin raja bhaiya ke karagaar mantri banane par ashanka he ki ve apane prabhaav kaa istemaal karke rajnatik virodhiyon ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 One such opponent, Diwakar, is lodged in Shukla jail and Shukla's family in Kunda are worried
 raja bhaiya aisi ashankaon ko khaarij karte hue kehete hai, ‘maine kisi mantralay kii maang nahin kii thi
 'raja Bhaiya may not have asked for the Prison Department but the new Chief Minister may have handed over this sensitive ministry in view of his experience

 Sixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg of Sweden and some other youth her age have filed cases against Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Germany and France for not taking action against climate change, but not against the US, per capita Harmful gas emissions are the highest in the world
 ye kishor us sweden par bhi muqadama nahin kar rahe hai jiskaa prati vyakti gas utsarjan brazil ke prati vyakti gas utsarjan kaa do-guna he
 The per capita emissions of various countries reflect its pollution contribution to the world's climate
 america is suchi main sabase upar he
 The per capita emissions from almost all developed countries, including Germany and France, are more than double
 duniya ke har viksit desh kaa gas utsarjan asia ke vikasshil deshon kii tulana main (china ko chhodkar) teen-guna adhik he
 The rate of per capita emissions of African developing countries is nothing compared to other countries in the world
 agar aap tulana karen, masalan ek new yorker kii brazil yaa turki ke kisi gaanv main rahane vaali mahila se, to prati vyakti gas utsarjan kaa antar in deshon ke rashtriya ausat ke antar se kahin adhik hoga
 It is said that if everyone starts living like the Swedes, then we will need 7 Earths to deal with the problem of emissions
 is sandarbh main, kisi vikasshil desh ko nishaanaa banane kaa koi tuk nahin banataa
 For this reason, in the developing countries and developed countries for years, their sympathetic partners have fought to keep poverty and per capita emissions at the center of climate-related debates
 agar aap prati vyakti utsarjan ko nahin dekhte hai to aap utsarjan ke asli kaaran ko chhupate hai jo ki jeevanstyli (takneekee bhashaa main “upbhog”) or utpaadan ke paryaavarniya rup se hanikaarak (“arakshniya”) tareeqe hai
 If you ignore per capita emissions, you bring back the pre-1970 racism and eugenicism that caused the population of developing countries and their socio-economic aspirations to cause climate worsening
 jalwaayu, vikaas or jansankhya par hone vaali har baatcheet apane main naslwad or sujananawaad kaa beej rakhti he
 What should be the population according to the limited resources of the earth; Or the question of how to divide industrial production between countries, nationally or globally, leads us closer to the dangerous place where we start thinking about unethical discrimination between people or imposing undemocratic restrictions on them
 naji yatnaa shiviron se lekar eboriginal bacchon ko jabaran god liya janaa or apaat-kaal ke samay bharat ke nasbandi shivi, itihaas aise udaahranon se bharaa hua he jahaan rajya dwaara pryojit bhayanak kaaryakramon ko janata ke swasthya, bacchon ke behatar bhavishya or jansankhya niyantran ke naam par uchit tehraaya gaya he
 This does not mean that we should not talk about the environment, but we should know that a gene in the family of ideas that comes to the environment is also of madness and we should be alert to the ideas that have this gene Is likely to happen
 jalwaayu par hone vaali bahason ke anubhaviyon ko is raste kaa koob pataa he
 Over the last 50 years, people around the world have developed a framework in which to discuss these issues without being caught in racism, eugenicism and the oppressive actions of the state
 yahi kaaran he ki sanyukt raashtra ke sadsy rajya is baat par hameshaa jor dete hai ki jalwaayu, vikaas or jansankhya ko alag-alag nahin, balki garibi, vyaktigat swasthy, aarthik vikaas or naagarik swatantraaa kii vistrut chahardivari main dekha jaayegaa
 This approach has been agreed in the United Nations since the 70s
 is vishay main or jaankaree ke icchhuk 1974 main sanyukt raashtra bucharesti sammelan, 1994 main kahiraa sammelan kii kaarywahi kii yojana or 2000 sanyukt raashtra milinium dawalpment gol (emdiji / sahasrabdi lakshya) kaa adhyayan kar sakate hai
 These are not merely historical principles, they have recently been reiterated in the United Nations' 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs / Sustainable Development Goals)
 sabase mahatvapurn baat, in sabhi samjhauton main spasht or sahamat siddhant he ki jalwaayu ksharan kii rokthaam kii shuruyaat viksit deshon dwaara hogi
 Developed countries have also taken the responsibility of providing clean technologies and environmental solutions
 ye siddhant 1992 ke yuan fremawork kanvension on climet change (yuanegsisisi) tathaa 2016 ke paris samjhauta main bhi darj hai
 Those working on climate change talk of "consensus"
 yah he paryaavaran par duniya kii aam sahmati
 It is agreed to a complete and fair response to the dual problem of environment and progress
 yah ek acchhee sahmati he; shaayad is simit or asmaan prithvi ke liye ekmaatr sambhavit sahmati
 Yet it seems that Greta Thunberg, and more importantly, the people standing behind her, are trying to circumvent this consensus on climate
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki inhone vikasshil or prati vyakti utsarjan main kahin boune thaharne vaale argentina, turki or brazil jaise deshon ke khilaaf vaishvik jalwaayu kii suraksha ke vishay main muqadama daayar kiya he
 The US has rejected climate change environmentalism as opposed to American ideology
 lekin america par muqadama na kiye jane kaa bahaanaa yah diya ja rahaa he ki vah bal adhikaron ke liye sanyukt raashtra kanvension (yuensiarsi) kaa hissaa nahin he
 After all, why did the operators of Thunberg not sue America under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes the United States? The US has so far only come out of the Paris Agreement, not the Comprehensive Climate Convention
 yahaan greta thunberg ko badhaava dene waalon kaa asli makasad or samaj shaq ke ghere main aa jaati he
 It is true that carbon footprint and climate change have attracted global attention, but both emissions and climate change are not the only causes but (it is claimed) to be the result of environmentally unsustainable production and consumption
 lekin satat upbhog or utpaadan ko sanyukt raashtra kii jalwaayu charchaaon se baahar kiya gaya he
 It is placed in the "framework for Sustainable Consumption and Production Programs" which is less effective and less visible than climate discussions
 paris samjhauta ek bhavy drushti kii udghoshnaa karata he: vaishvik ausat taapmaana ko audyogikaran se purv ke ausat taapmaana se adhiktam 2 degree celsius adhik tak laayaa jaayegaa
 But he does not have any list of special work to be done to reach it
 paris samjhauta multah sarkaron se svaichhik rup se utsarjan ghataane kii maatra kii ghoshnaa kii maang karne tak simit he
 The absence of definitive action on consumption and production in a climate agreement is a gimmick
 duusari taraf, satat upbhog or utpaadan ke fremawork ne bas satat swaroop prapti ke suchakaankon se kagaz kaale kiye hai
 In simple terms, countries have not even set the scale of the consumption (or not being) sustainable of the consumption and production of the products, while they are talking big about reducing the carbon footprint
 akhir utsarjan ko kam karne kii baat yah desh tab tak kaise kah sakate hai jab tak ki unhen yah hi pataa na ho ki unke dwaara kiye jane vaale kin kaarnon se vaataavaran main kitni carbon dioxide ghul rahi he
 From the debates in the sustainable consumption and production framework, so far only a few light proposals like eco-tourism and eco-friendly building have come out
 isse nazar aata he ki viksit desh vaataavaran kii suraksha ke prati kitne gambhir hai
 Those raising environmental issues should focus their attention on developing countries like Turkey, Brazil and Argentina instead of litigating them here
 in deshon kaa na sirf prati vyakti utsarjan kam he balki inhone apane vikaas-chakra main, kisi bhi viksit desh kii tulana main bahut pehle paryaavaran ke anukool vyavhaar ke siddhant par sahmati di he
 According to the United Nations' Greenhouse Emissions List, Turkey is the country with the largest reduction in greenhouse emissions compared to any developed country
 gambhir paryaavarnavidon kaa dhyaan prati vyakti carbon footprint par or satat upbhog or utpaadan par hone vaali bahason se kuch thos parinaam nikaalane par hona chahie
 a country like Turkey, Brazil and Argentina on a climate issue by a Swedish citizen is a blatant and presumptuous disregard of the fact that the amount of carbon emissions per capita generated by developed countries is much higher than developing countries
 sanyukt raashtra bal adhikaar samjhauta kaa is prakaar ek suvidha sampann jivan ji rahe sweden ke yuva dwaara durupyog kiya janaa ise or bhi dukhad banaata he
 This agreement was made to help poor, weak and poor children in eating, wearing and shelter
 sanyukt raashtra bal adhikaar samjhauta aarthik vikaas kii “parikthaon” se nahin, balki un bacchon kii samasyaon se jujhataa he jo yuddh or akaal kii tabaahi jhel rahe hai, jinhen bhayanak garibi ke kaaran veshyavriti yaa kathortam shram main dhakel diya gaya ho
 i am fully with the youth who usually appear more serious and responsible than the teenagers of rich countries
 lekin bade mudde bade dhyaan kii maang karte hai
