parrikar ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kar goa main sarkaar banane kaa daawa bhi pesh kiya he
 Parrikar has claimed the support of 21 mlas
 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa patr lekar kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke saath parrikar rajbhavan pahunche
 Significantly, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), which was ready to support the BJP, had put a condition that if Manohar Parrikar will be made the Chief Minister of Goa, then only he will give support
 MGP ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ne mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha tha ki ve bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye tabhi samarthan de sakate hai jab rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ko goa ke mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari di jaae
 The MGP has 3 elected mlas
 dhavlikar goa main mediakarmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 He made his point clear by writing a letter to BJP President Amit Shah
 goa main bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye 9 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, denying the support of its old ally MGP would mean that the BJP gets away from the race for power
 dhavlikar ke manohar parrikar or bijepi se barkaraar rishton main khatas tab aayi jab lakshmikant parsekar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 The MGP withdrew support to the BJP government after Parsekar's statement against MGP ministers
 iske baad MGP ne shivasena or goa suraksha manch ke saath gathjod kar bijepi ko chunauti di
 This alliance has won only 3 seats
 unke samarthan se bijepi 13 se 16 tak to pahunch jaaegi
 Apart from MGP, the Goa forward is also positive about Manohar Parrikar's leadership
 is gut ke paas bhi 3 vidhayakon kaa sankhyabal he
 Gut leader Vijay Sardesai told the media in Goa that Parrikar was a better person than the Congress
 congress ne goa forward ke ummidavaaron ko pratadit kiya he
 In such a situation, how will it be possible to support the Congress? With the support of Goa Forward too, BJP will get closer to majority and it can have the support of 19 mlas
 tippaniyan There are now 3 independent mlas in Goa
 inamen rohan khanvate, govind gaavade or prasad gaanvkar shaamil hai
 Everyone's eyes are on his attitude
 inamen se seve goa front ke prasad gaanvkar ko bijepi ne samarthan de kar chunaav main utaara he or jisase bijepi gathbandhan kaa aankada 20 tak pahunch rahaa he
 While the remaining 2 independents, the Congress has placed its bet on Rohan Khawante
 goa prabharee or varisht congress netaa digvijay singh ne samvaadadaata sammelan kar kaha ki rohan khanvate kii congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaaqaat ho chuki he or ve congress ke saath rahenge
 However, despite the support of Rohan Khawante and ncp's 1-1 MLA, the Congress alliance is lagging behind the MLA 1
 in paristhitiyon main siem banane ja rahe manohar parrikar ko 6 maheene ke bheetar goa vidhansabha kaa sadsy bananaa hoga
 For which the resignation of the current MLA is necessary
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar maharashtravaadi gomantak party (MGP) ne shart rakhi thi ki agar manohar parrikar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya jayega tabhi wo samarthan degi
 MGP leader Sudhir Dhavalikar had told media persons that he can only support the BJP to bring it to power if Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar is given the responsibility of the post of Chief Minister of Goa
 MGP ke 3 vidhayak chunakar aae hai
 Dhavalikar was talking to media persons in Goa
 unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko khat likhakar apni baat spasht kar di thi
 9 mlas are needed to bring BJP to power in Goa
 aise main apane puraane sahyogi MGP kaa miltaa samarthan nakaarne kaa matlab hoga ki bijepi satta kii daud se dur ho jaae
 The tense relationship between Dhavalikar's Manohar Parrikar and the BJP came when Laxmikant Parsekar was made the Chief Minister of Goa
 parsekar dwaara MGP ke mantriyon ke kilaaf die bayaan ke baad MGP ne BJP sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 After this, the MGP in alliance with Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch challenged the BJP

 With his support, BJP will reach from 13 to 16
 MGP ke alaava goa forward bhi manohar parrikar ke netritv ko lekar sakaaratmak he
 This group also has a strength of 3 mlas

 In an event organized on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the CBI, Manmohan Singh said that it would not be appropriate if the police agency or the investigating agency were to decide which policy was correct and which was not, without evidence of disturbances
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki gambhir or samvedansheel jaanch media kii bahes kaa mudda ban gai hai, vah bhi aise tathyon ke aadhaar par, jo janata ke saamne hai hi nahin
 He said that the intervention of the investigation agencies of the country in the investigation of cases related to administrative decisions and policy making is constantly increasing, it requires very careful investigation in such cases
 unhone jaanch main or paardarshita laane kii bhi baat kahi, lekin saath hi kaha ki jaanch agenciyaan desh ke prashasinic kaamon main or nitigat faisle main bhi jaanch kar rahi hai or aise maamalon main satarkta baratani hogi
 Apparently, the Prime Minister was also pointing to the cbi's investigation on the telecom scam and policy decisions in the coal scam
 pradhanmantri ne sibiai evam state anti karpshan beuro on kaaman stritegi tu kambet karpshan and krime sammelan ke dauraan kaha, haal hi main sibiai kii vaidhata ko lekar kuch sawaal saamne aae hai
 Our government will investigate this issue seriously and expeditiously
 unhone kaha, is tarah ke masale par desh kii sarvocch adaalat ko bhi bina andeh ke vichaar karnaa chahie
 Manmohan Singh assured that the government will take every necessary step to establish the legitimacy of the CBI and secure its past and future
 piem ne kaha ki sibiai ne behtareen kaam kiya he or yah karypalika kaa abhinn ang he
 The Bench of the Guwahati High Court last week questioned the legitimacy of the country's top investigating agency, saying it was not legitimately a police force

 smriti / jagajeet singh1941-2011shaayad hi koi or gayak ghazal ke saath is kadar ekaakaar nahin he, jitne ki ghazal gayak jagajeet singh
 Khushi and mischief were both his companions
 jab ve apni jaadui aawaaj se shrotaaon ko apane agosh main baandh rahe hote the to ek sharaarat si unki ankhon main chamak uthati thi
 It is no wonder that more than half a billion people in the whole world are crazy about him
 nam aakhon ne di jagajeet singh ko vidaai |photozane-maane kavi nida fazli kehete hai, ''yah jagajeet kii aawaaj kaa jaadu he
 It has the sweetness of a mother, the beauty of a father's love, the tenderness of a deep close relationship
 unki aawaaj ghaav par maraham kii tarah he
 She comes to you and goes back without asking for anything
 '' yahi vah jaadui aawaaj thi, jo hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye shant ho gai
 He was very young when he came to Mumbai metropolis to try his luck from the small city of Ganganagar
 phir unhone beshumaar shoharat or safalataa batori or sangeet kii duniya main apana mukaam banaaya
 Ghazal king Jagjit Singh is no more
 
 
 |exclusive videosastreey gayika reeta ganguli kahati hai, ''mujhe yaad he ki mahaan gayika begum akhtar se nnag
 He was introduced to HMV for recording of waters
 ve us daur main aae the, jab ghazal ke liye talat mahmud kii aawaaj ek tayshuda rup akhriyaar kar chuki thi
 The sound of 'jag Jeet' will resonate, there was a slow pause in the film music and Jagjit Singh with his lyrical ghazals came into the music world like a fresh breeze
 unki aawaaj main ek anoothaapan tha
 It was a unique voice of its kind
 aap kishor kumaar yaa mohammad rafee kii nakal kar sakate hai, lekin jagajeet kii aawaaj kii nakal nahin kii ja sakati
 This is why Jagjit Singh will remain only one
 ''aise bhi jatanhin koi
 
 
 Jagjit Singh had an insight into what the audience wanted, a little bit of companionship and enthusiasm
 unke sabhi sangeet kaaryakramon main yah baat hoti thi
 He was quite comfortable with the audience
 ve jaanate the ki unako sangeet ke jhenkon main kaise baha le janaa he
 As if they would ask the audience to sing along with them or sing along with the chorus
 exclusil: jagajeet singh ke jivan kaa safarsampreshan kii unki kala or takanic kamaal kii thi
 He used to say, "my art of singing, the selection of songs and poems and most important is the dialogue with the audience
" pataa he, lalu prasad yadav kaa itnaa naam kyon he? kyonki ve na sirf aam aadmi ke saath, balki sansad main or televijan par bhi behatar samvaad karte hai
 This is the original content of any artist
 '' unka kahana bilkul sahi tha
 When the era of pop music, remixes and item songs created an existential crisis for real music and the importance of Ghazals began to wane, they launched their videos
 ve ek aise ghazal gayak ban gaye, jinka video bhi tha
 He said, "today is the era of visual things
 aaj sangeet suna nahin, dekha jaataa he
 There was a time when only voice and music were our identity, but now we have to appear on video, have to perform concerts to promote our album, because that is what sells
 durbhaagya se ham bhi in chizon kii jakadbandi main funs gaye hai
 "he understood the modern market very well and accordingly he made efforts to further his music
" unhone parampara se alag hatakar ek kaam yah bhi kiya ki apane concert main guitar or voyalin jaise vaadyayantron ko shaamil kiya
 He did this because he found it important to create variety of instruments and sounds in his music
 unke concert main upasthit hona apane aap main ek sampurna, aatma ko samrudgh karne vaala anubhav hota tha
 He did one more thing, away from tradition
 unhone apane album close tu da heart main lata mangeshkar, mukesh, hemanth kumaar, talat mahmud or kishor kumaar ke 50, 60 or 70 ke dashak ke prasidgh geet gaae
 It was also severely criticized, but the fans took it in hand
 ghazal kaa badshaah puraane daur ke geet kyon ga rahaa he?unhone jawaab diya, '' agar lata mangeshkar or aashaa bhonsle aisa kar sakati hai to phir main kyon nahin?'' ve apni tarah ke vidrohi bhi the
 Apart from making popular poets like Mirza Ghalib popular among the masses, he also worked to popularize new poets
 jivan main ghati traasadiyon ne baad ke dinon main unhen alag tarah kaa insaan bana diya tha
 They changed drastically after the first 21-year-old son Vivek died in a car accident and then the step daughter
 ve kuch aadhyatmik ho gaye the or kehete the ki sangeet hi vah ekmaatr maraham he, jo unhen unke dukhon se nijaat dilaa saktaa he
 Later, he released spiritual albums such as Hey Ram, Gurbani, Krishna etc
 jo sabhi ke sabhi kaaphi hit rahe
 This was the magic of his music and his voice
 santoor vadak pandit sivakumar sharma kehete hai, ''unhone ghazal ko ek nayaa mode diya
 "they were worried about Ghazal's future
 ve kehete the ki ghazal gayak ko kavita or samskruti kii bhi samaj honi chahie
 Nowadays nobody is singing anything
 usamen koi vivek, samaj or santulan nahin he
 In the old days, there was an audition of voice in All India Radio and the poet used to check the poetry you used to sing
 vah jimmedaari kaa kaam hota tha
 i am worried about what will happen to our culture in times to come
 What will happen to our future generations? He was also saddened by the way music companies treat singers and artists
 ghazal gayaki ke saath-saath unhone apane samay kii kai behtareen filmon kaa sangeet bhi taiyaar kiya
 His music in films was different and unique
 unke sangeet kii ek alag pahchaan bani
 His music was melodious and the words of the songs were very meaningful
 jivan ke aakhir ke kuch varshon main ve apane hi bheetar ke kalakaar ko paar nahin kar paae
 But whatever, he has a long series of songs sung in Hindi cinema, which serve to bring relief and comfort to the depressed hearts in sorrow
 unke upar sachmuch ishwar kii krupa thi
 Some people say that God had specially created musical strings for his throat
 or yahi ek cheez thi, jo unhen baaki sabhi gayakon se alag karti thi
 He was a saintly soul with a golden magical voice: If you go away you will think, what have we lost, what have we found
 afsos! hamane bahut kuch kho diya

 rajasthan ke alvar main go-taskari ke aarope main ek shaks ko peet-petakar maar diya gaya
 He has a bad health with the family

 Everything of this family was lost on Saturday night
 darasal alvar jile ke ramgarh thana kshetra ke lalwandi gaanv main go taskari ke aarope main is parivaar ke mukhiya kii berahami se bheed ne peet-peet kar hatya kar di
 According to the police, they got information about one o'clock on Saturday night that there are two smugglers who are taking the cows from Rajasthan towards Haryana
 unhen kuch logon ne gheraa hua he or marpet bhi kii he
 Go-smugglers started beating understandably, after getting information about the case, when the police reached the spot, some people were seen running away
 maukey par do log do gaay ko lekar khadey the jabaki ek shaks ghayal avasthaa main keechad main sanaa hua mila
 When the injured person came to know about him, it was found that his name is Rakbar, who is a resident of Kol village police station Ferozepur, Haryana
 rakabar ne police ko bataaya ki wo ore uskaa saathi ladpur se do gaay kharidkar paidal hi lalwandi gaanv ke jangal se hote hue apane gaanv ja rahe the tabhi kuch logon nego-taskar samaj karunhen maarna-peetna shuru kar diya
 Somehow his partner Aslam managed to escape from the spot
 iske baad rakabar achaanak behosh ho gaya
 The police admitted Rakbar to the injured Rajiv Gandhi General Hospital in Alwar where the doctor declared him dead
 4 saal pehle darj hua tha maamalapulisake mutabik jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki mritak rakabar par saal 2014 main bhi go-taskari kaa maamla darj hua tha
 At present, the matter is being investigated whether this case is of Go-smuggling or not
 police kaa kahana he ki ab tak ki jaanch main koi aisa saboot nahi mila he jisase ye sabit ho ki rakabar or uskaa saathi gaayon ko kharid kar laae hon, lekin maamle kii jaanch jari he
 Also, two people have been detained, named Dharmendra Yadav and Paramjeet
 chashmadid asalam ke mutabik jab wo khanpur se gaay kharid kar waapas aa rahe the tabhi kuch logon ne unhen gher liya or bina kuch bole marpet karnaa shuru kar diya
 They had weapons in their hands
 unhone hawa main firing bhi shuru kar di jiske baad asalam mauka dekhakar bhaag niklaa, lekin rakabar vahiin funs gaya
 Aslam says that these people were buying two cows for 30-30 thousand
 bakra kharidne gaya thavhin is maamle main haryana ke nunhu jile ke ferozepur tehsil ke kol gaanv main rahane vaale rakabar ke pita suleman kaa kahana he ki rakabar pahaad main pathar todane kaa kaam karata tha
 He came to pick up the goat with his partner
 uskaa go-taskari se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 But it was admitted that in 2014, the case of racket-smuggling was registered, but he had left this work
 pita kaa kahana he ki rakabar mahaj 38 saal kaa tha jiske 7 bachche he
 Today these people are demanding justice, while according to Rakbar's elder brother Rakbar used to raise cows along with wages and used to sell milk
 unka kahana ki rakabar bataakar gaya tha ki wo gaay lene ja rahaa he, lekin kahaan yah nahin bataaya
 Now what about the children? According to Harkbar's mother-in-law, Rakbar has 7 children and he was the only one earning at home
 ab unke bacchon kaa kya hoga
 However, the police is engaged in gathering information about the remaining people by questioning both the people detained in this case
 police kaa kahana he ki jald hi is maamle main kuch or giraftaar ho sakati he, lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki ye koi pehla aisa maamla nahin he jab bheed ne gau-taskari ke aarope main kisi kii peet-peet kar hatya kii ho
 This has happened before also
 aise maamle main tamaam karrwai ke daawey bhi kiye gaye, baavjood iske aisi ghatana kaa baar-baar hona kai sawaal khadey karata he

 The comments gauratlab he ki dilli mantrimandal ne didisie main kathith aniyamittaaon kii jaanch ke liye subramanyam kii adhyakshata main ek-sadasyeey ayog ke gathan ko somvaar ko manjuuri de di
 Subramaniam said in a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, 'I will accept the work based on the understanding that the commission's objective is positive and the government should benefit from taking cricket to a better and higher level
 ' He also said that it would be right to mention that Arun Jaitley, whose name has come in the news, has been my valuable and outstanding companion for almost 37 years

 The Dhumal family's role had become secondary to the rising stature at the center of Nadda and Chief Minister Jairam Thakur
 isi ke saath dhumal samarthakon ne soshal media ke madhyam se unhen adhyaksh pad dene kii maang chhedi he
 But officially the party leaders deny it
 do dinon ke daure par rajya aae bhaajapa ke pradesh prabharee mangal pandey kehete hai, ''jab sarkaar banati he to kai tarah kii apekshaayen bhi hoti hai
 There is a difference of opinion in the family sometime
 par baatcheet se sabakaa samaadhaan nikal aata he
 Party people are together in Himachal
 ''bordon-nigamon main abhi tak koi bhi tajposhi nahin hone kii vajah bhi yahi he ki niyuktiyon par ek raay nahin ban paa rahi
 Therefore, the proposed names of Union Minister Nadda, Party President Satpal Satti and former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal have been handed over to the high command by the Chief Minister
 baat keval itani hi nahin he ki tajposhi main party ke kin naamon ko hari jhandi mili, balki dilachasp baat yah ki mukhyamantri jairam thakur bhi taal nahin thok paa rahe hai
 The impact of Nadda, contacts with mps Shanta Kumar and Anurag Thakur and then the effect of Dhumal are some of the things that Jayaram is not able to do openly
 haalanki unka kahana he, ''abhi to maatr 6 maheene hue hai
 Our focus is on development

 lekin aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar rajya main congress ko gherne ke liye bhaajapa ke paas koi bada mudda haath nahin laga he
 Surprisingly, the friendly atmosphere of the opposition and the government also remains constant
 kyonki purv mukhyamantri virbhadra singh khud ko sibiai or idi kii maar se bachaana chaahate hai, aise main sust padi congress ikai bhaajapa sarkaar par kuch bol nahin paa rahi
 On the other hand, Prem Kumar Dhumal has another reason for concern
 darasal, virbhadra singh ne himachal pradesh cricket association ke maamle main jo cese banaae the, unhen jairam sarkaar takneekee pech ke kaaran satta main aane ke baavjood waapas nahin le pai he
 On the other hand, Nadda wants to establish himself in Himachal
 inhen vajahon se mukhyamantri jairam thakur kii chunautiyaan kaaphi bad gai hai
 They are unable to speak even on the 'poor' performance of some ministers in trying to run the government and keep pace with all
 agle loksabhaa chunaav main pradesh kii 4 siton par jeet hasil karne kii jimmedaari party ikai kii bajaae is baar mukhyamantri par hogi

 Then in October 2001, air missiles were fired for the attack on the Taliban

 If Piyush Babelle / Santosh Kumar Agar, former Airhostess of MDLR Airlines, Geetika Sharma, would not have given her life by hanging herself from the fan on the morning of August 5, former Haryana Minister of State for Home Affairs Gopal Goyal Kanda would have become an example of women's empowerment in the country
 aakhir usne apni 36 companiyon main 19 mahilaon ko diarector yaa isi tarah ke oonche ohadon par bithaaya he
 He is the leader who has called a separate public meeting for women for campaigning and is the one who has never denied even the legendary heroines like Pooja Batra, Rati Agnihotri to Hema Malini to attend the gathering
 usne apane saath judi takreeban har ladki kii kismat badal di
 Someone gave a BMW car as a gift, then left the entire showroom to someone
 yah kanda kii najare inayat hi thi ki geetika jaisi kai maamuli mahilaayein karmchaaree raturaat company main oonche ohadon par pahunch gayi
 But it is not a coincidence that Kanda, who is inebriated and inebriated, has saved most of the beauties who were either unmarried or willing to leave their husbands
 1952 main jansangh ke tikat par sirsa se vidhansabha chunaav haarane vaale kattar sanghee muralidhar kanda kaa sabase bada betaa shuru se hi jaanata tha ki siyasat ke galiyaaron main kin chizon kii tuuti sabase zyada bolti he
 Leeladhar Saini, who was his associate in Kanda's adorable Tara Baba's hut, ponders a lot of thought, "the stories of cheap novels in the lines of Shkok Shastri have never descended from Gopal's mind in which women and money gain everything Examples to be done are full
 uski kitabon kii dukaan bhale hi na chali ho, lekin in kitabon ne uske dimag ko khub chalaaya
 "he is a pure broker," says Ajay Chaitala, once a political leader
 agar gaharaai se jaanch ho to yah maamla desh kaa sabase bada sex racket sabit hoga
 "but regardless of these allegations, Kanda went on a journey to earn money and the number of his royal women continued to grow
 geetika sharma, ankitha singh, nupur mehta or aruna singh to ve chand naam hai jo kanoonee pachade main ulajhane ke kaaran saarvajanik ho gaye, lekin kanda ke sansar main or bhi aisi ladkiyaan hai jinaki tarakkee kaa graph in mahilaon se miltaa he
 The fate of a girl's family in Sirsa, which saw her family's business, changed in a few years
 pehle is ladki ke parivaar kii mali haalat jahaan khasta thi, vahiin ab uske pita kaaron kaa showrooms chalaa rahe hai
 a woman in another company of Kanda reached the rank of COO very fast
 lambey samay tak kanda ke driver rahe ek shaks ne bataaya, "gudgaanv aane ke baad kanda sahab ne ek mahila secretary kii bhartee kii thi
 The secretary was clearly instructed to get the file passed, even if it had to be done
 "kamyaabi ke liye kuch bhi karnaa jaise kanda kaa mantra hi ban gaya
 Her bookstore (1979), Jupiter Electronics (1982), shoe store (1985), bottled water and shoe-making factories have failed one after the other but have never lost her spirits
 usne emdlaar airlines kholi lekin vah ghate main rahi
 Two casinos opened in Goa, they too could never run
 lekin uski jindagi or kaarobaar main ladakiyon kii sankhya badhati hi rahi
 Also, his hobbies of giving fabulous parties and prized gifts were not affected
 saini bataate hai, "maine kanda se poocha ki baari tere dhandhe to ghate main chal rahe hai, phir airlines main itani ladkiyaan kyon rakh lee hai? tu ghate ke dhandhe se hi kyon chipka rahata he
 In response, Kanda said that Saini you are a Bhagat man
 tum dhandhe kii baaten kya samajhenge
 These girls and airplanes are not to make a profit, but to reach out to influential people
 "or hua bhi kuch aisa hi
 Kanda, who left Sirsa at Tara Baba's 'order' in Gurgaon in 1997, caught the pulse of this town emerging in the real estate arena
 haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bansilaal ke bete divangat surendra singh ke kareeb aakar kanda gudgaanv ke real estate kaarobaar main chaa gaya
 If there was thunder, then Ajay Chaitala's 'shoes' should be eaten
 2003 ke baad ek samay vah bhi aayaa jab anusuchit jati ke logon ko aavantit plot ko land yuj badalakar bikwane kaa chota-motaa dhandha karne vaale kanda ke bina gudgaanv main koi bhi badi land deal karnaa naammumkin-sa ho gaya
 Her colleague Surendra Minchanawadi says, "kanda is the worm of property
 jaise koi kabadi kabad ke pahaad main se ek najar main beshkeemtee cheez pahchaan letaa he, vaise hi kanda sahi property par daanv lagaataa he
 "kanda earned money from his unmatched talent in the property business
 usne raajnneeti kii nabj samajhne main kabhi deree nahin kii
 When Kanda saw Bhupendra Singh Hooda regaining control of Haryana's throne in 2009, he immediately joined Hooda's camp
 hooda se uski dosti gaharaari tak pahunchi or mukhyamantri uski berthde party main kek khilaane pahunchane lage (dekhen box)
 Actually, the Birthday Party has been a big platform for Kanda's public relations campaign from the very beginning
 usne apni pehali badi berthde party 1998 main gudgaanv ke bristol hotel main di thi, jahaan surendra singh bhi maujuud the
 Kanda soon built his farm house in Gurgaon
 or isi farm house main uski giraftaar se pehle tak hafte main do baar shandaar partiyaan hua karti thim
 Kanda, who did not touch liquor himself, used to pour rivers of alcohol at these parties
 partiyon main shariq rahe ek shaks kii maane to yahaan bhartiya ladakiyon ke saath roosi or uzbek ladkiyaan bhi najar aati thim
 In 2009, Kanda also bought a Mint Casino in Goa, as his wealth grew
 haryana ke bade se bade raison ne jo kaam nahin kiya tha vah kanda ne kiya or casino ke udghaatan main haryana ke 40 logon ko le gaya
 The specialty of his invitation card was that air tickets to and from the card were printed
 casino party main gaye kai logon ne yah tasdik kii ki vah unki jindagi kii sabase behtareen party thi, jahaan unhone vah sara lutf uthaaya jo aam aadmi apane sapanom main sochataa he
 These two casinos of Goa 'mint' and 'casino Rio' are of special importance in the life of Kanda
 darasal, kanda apni kathith partner ankitha singh ko sirsa se dur kisi aisi jagah settle karana chahta tha, jahaan uskaa parivaar dakhal na de sake or aisi jagah kii talash goa ke casino ke rup main khatm hui
 However, Ankita continued to visit Gurgaon after this
 geetika aatmahatya cond ke baad se hi ankitha apane bachche ke saath singapore main he or ab tak police usase poochtacha nahin kar saki he
 Later, in this casino, Kanda also brought another of his old colleague Nupur Mehta
 ye noopur mehta vahi hai jinka naam kuch maheene pehle cricket match phixing vivaad main bhi aayaa tha
 kanda-nupur's relationship was volatile
 police sutron kii maane to kanda ne kaha he ki usne gudgaanv main noopur ko 500 varg gaj kaa makaan tohfe main diya tha
 But when Nupur first separated from him, in 2009, Kanda sent the goons to evacuate the house
 haalanki noopur ne aise kisi bhi tohfe kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 Kanda's misfortune would be said to have sent Geetika to Goa as well
 police kii maane to yahi kanda se najdiki ko lekar teenon mahilaon main ghamaasan shuru hua
 Nupur and Ankita had also filed a case against Geetika here
 udhar kanda kii sabase puraani raajadaar aruna chadda ko to geetika ne apane suicide note main sari khuraafaat kaa sargana bataaya he
 Aruna, the mother of a child, also lives separately from her husband
 kabhi puure emdlaar samooh ko apni ungaliyon par nachaane vaali aruna philhal jail main he or kori uskaa haal poochne bhi nahin ja rahaa he
 She is accused of being the head of the company's HR department for recruiting girls into the company and forcing them to join Kanda's handiwork
 police kanda kii is raajadaar se ek-ek raaj ugalva rahi he or kanda nyaayik hiraasat main hanuman chalisa kaa paath kar rahaa he
 In Geetika's suicide note, the word 'bad man' written for Kanda has confused her fate lines
 geetika kii maut se do din pehle kanda ne laal rang kii ek nai hammer gaadi kharidi
 On the same day, in an informal conversation with the media, he said that he has identified 24 such seats in Haryana where the Vaishya voters dominate
 in siton par vah apane pratyaashee utaaregaa or phir uski marji ke bina haryana main koi mukhyamantri nahin ban sakegaa
 That means Kanda will be the uncrowned king of Haryana's politics
 kanda kii parwaaj oonchi honi thi, lekin satta or dhan ke ahankaar main vah yah bhul gaya ki aurat koi khilonaa nahin he
 a woman can get caught in a man's entourage, but she cannot become a market ladder of progress forever
 kanda ke ehsaan tale dabe hone ke baavjood geetika ne samarpan kii bajaae khud ko khatm karnaa behatar samaj
 His death became the reason for Kanda's destruction
 rajaneta aise sabak akasar oonchi keemat chukaakar sikhte hai

 According to the survey, 20-20 seats of Congress and BJP are set to go to 5 seats in aap's part
 par baaki 25 siton par aam aadmi party ke aane se chunavi dangal or bhi mjedaar ho gaya he
 It is said that Delhi tells the mood of the country, so winning Delhi is the most important for Congress and BJP
 rajdhani main mahangaai or bhrashtachar ko lekar jabardast public mood to he hi par AAP ke aane se donon mukhya partiyon ke chehre par pareshaani saaf jhalkati he
 In the 2008 assembly elections, there was a close contest between the Congress and the BJP in these 25 seats, but the survey has indicated that the AAP may lose the intention of both parties this time

 ) Yes, we are talking about the brotherhood of Congressmen i
e
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 unako khaskar raibareli or amethi ke congressi bhaiyyaji ke naam se pukaarte hai
 In 4 seats in amethi-rae Bareli, the stronghold of Gandhi family, the sp-congress candidates are face to face, the situation continues to be controlled, due to which Priyanka postponed Amethi Rae Bareli's intensive campaign from Valentine's Day i
e
 14 February
 priyanka ke kareebi isko sahi qaraar de rahe the, to tamaam kaaryakarta apane bhaiyyaji ke aane kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, suddenly on February 17, Priyanka's program with brother Rahul was organized in Rae Bareli rallies
 congress main sonia kii jagah rahul le rahe hai or priyanka sirf unki sahyogi kii bhoomika main hai, iskaa yahaan bhi priyanka ne is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa
 In the first rally, only Rahul said, Priyanka just sat on the stage
 sandesh saafe tha ki, rahul kii chamak ke aade wo khud naa aane paaen
 After Indira-like image, Priyanka came to the stage in Rae Bareli's second rally and took the mic
 wo khud ko indira ke jaisaa maanati hai or kaaryakarta bhi unamem indira kii chhavi dekhte hai, to priyanka bhi iskaa khaasaa khyaal rakhti hai
 Everyone has seen Indira's hairstyle, Indira's style of wearing a saree and Indira's style of giving a speech, but this time Priyanka, who has passed 45 years of age, also showed glasses in her hand, which while giving a speech He was also in her hand, which once held Indira
 priyanka kii muhkub focus karte hai, priyanka ke bhaashan par
 In the first political speech of UP, Priyanka adopted the same theme, which led to the alliance of SP and Congress
 yani bihar kii tarah gathjod banaakar bijepi ko chit kiya jaae
 Like Nitish on the lines of Bihar, Akhilesh should go ahead and fight, like the image of Nitish, Akhilesh's image should be kept ahead
 wo sab ho gaya to phir pike yani prashanth kishor ne bihar kii tarah 'bihari banaam bahari' jaisaa 'apane ladke banaam bahari modi' ko theme banaaya
 When this theme was final, it was Priyanka who gave her the green signal
 isliye priyanka ne bhaashan main isi baat par piem modi ko gherkar shuruyaat kii
 Attacking Modi, Priyanka said that, UP does not need any outsider, every young leader can become here
 ab jhaanson or khokhale vaadon main log nahin aane vaale, sab samajhadaar hai
 Rahul and Akhilesh have UP in Dilozhan
 iske baad notebandi or kanoon vyavastha kii baari ai
 Priyanka combined the two with a juggernaut of words
 boleen, mahilaon par atyaachaar kii baat karte hai, lekin sabase bada atyaachaar to 6 maheene se mahilaon ke saath hi hua, jab unki bachat ko chin liya or unako line main laga diya
 Priyanka surrounded the PM and said that instead of addressing a woman's sister, mother or wife, the woman should be identified personally
 kul milakar priyanka ne pehle chunavi samar main wo sab kiya, jisaki ummid thi
 However, instead of replying to Smriti Irani's attacks, she targeted PM Modi only
 ranneeti main badlaavlekin sawaal vahi he ki, 2007 main priyanka ne gandhi parivaar ke garh main 100 se zyaada reliyaan kii thim or congress 10 main se 7 siten party jeet gai
 Priyanka had a lot of fear, but in 2012 even after conducting more than 100 rallies and street meetings, Congress could win only two seats
 aise main is baar sapa or congress ke ummidavaaron ke 4 siton par aamane-saamne ladane se kahin rigelt behatar nahin rahaa to priyanka kii chhavi ko chot pahunch sakati he
 Therefore, the strategy of Congress and Priyanka changed at the last moment, their campaign was limited
 aakhir congress apane turup ke iqke par 2017 main daanv lagaakar 2019 kaa risk katai nahin lenaa chaahati
 In areas where there was havoc till a few weeks ago, there is now a havoc of floods
 tab ham sookhe ko jalwaayu parivartan ke sandarbh main dekh rahe the
 Now the flood is in terrible havoc, now we are watching the flood from the point of view of climate change
 zamin par baadh ke kaaran insaanon kii banaai nitiyaan hai jise main maid chrysis kehete hai
 Unfair use of natural resources increases the causes of climate change
 is baadh ko do tarah se samajhie
 What will happen if two months of rain falls in two weeks? kyon aisa ho rahaa he
 Believe it or not, people who have been warning about high dams, carbon emissions, and construction works on the banks of rivers, which we call experts, call them and listen to them, make fun of them, but they say one thing
 Is being proved right kai dashak se unke lekh sahi sabit hote ja rahe hai
 This devastation has resulted in the destruction of property and property worth billions of rupees
 ham bhoolanaa chaahate hai magar nadiyaan or prakruti bhuulane nahin de rahi hai
 You would see the Chief Ministers surveying the floods on TV with helicopters
 kabhi sochie ki helicopter main baithkar wo kya dekhte honge
 Expanses of water may have seen submerged houses and trees, but would they have seen the bad effects of their policies and plans, would they have thought that if there was a land on the banks of the river, if there were trees left, it would not have been so devastating
 mujhe nahin lagata ki koi mukhyamantri aatmachintan kar rahaa hoga
 This video of the helicopter tour is not about any chief minister being sensitive, but of being constantly indifferent to the causes of floods and devastation
 isliye helicopter survey ke baad mukhyamantri kya kah rahe hai dhyaan se sunen
 The figures in his statement will be heard, how many have died, how many are affected, how much is the compensation amount and will be talking about relief and rescue operations but will not speak on what is happening with the rivers
 ham in tasveeron ko dekhte hue is vakt nadi ko sirf apradhi ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 What crime has the man himself committed along the river
 aap in dinon nadi ke saundaryakaran kii yojana ke bare main sunate honge
 Governments know that people come for rituals along the banks of the river, so a lot of money is spent on the decoration of the ghat, so that the development is taking place
 karodon rupee kii yojana ban rahi he
 But there is no account of how much money is being wasted behind this foolishness in the name of brightness
 ek video main dikh rahaa he ki nadi kinare bana ek hathi kataav kii vajah se bah rahaa he
 TV would have told only how the huge elephant made of cement is collapsing and the giraffe is flowing in the flood water
 andhra pradesh main ek jagah he shrikakulam
 This video is not just about the flow of cement elephants and giraffes in the flood stream
 yahaan kii banshadhara nadi main baadh ai he
 Due to this, water came up to 30 feet ahead on Kalingapatnam beach and all this flowed
 do hathi, do jiraph or buddha kii ek pratimaa pani main bah gaye
 According to local media reports, the beach has been washed away
 paryaton vibhaag ne ise banaaya tha paryatakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye
 Now you see it flowing but do not see to what extent our policies and schemes are proving to be temporary
 to yah paisa barbaad ho gaya lekin likh kar rakhie yahaan or kahin or bhi paryaton bhi dobaaraa yahi karenge
 Will make cement idols

 Godrej, however, congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his "great vision" of building a new India and nearly doubling the size of the economy to $ 5,000 billion during his second term
 unhone iske saath hi yah bhi kaha ki desh main sab kuch thik nahin he, unhone saamaajik morche par ubhari chintaaon kii ore ishaara karte huye aarthik vikaas par padaane vaale unke dushprabhav ko lekar chetavanee di he

 He said that many issues should be resolved at the basic level

 bihar kii raajnneeti ke do dhurandharon - upmukhyamantri tathaa BJP ke varisht netaa susheel modi or RJD ke varisht netaa tathaa purv saansad shivanand tiwari ke bich anuchhed 370 par babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ke rukh ko lekar zordaar khinchataan hui he
 It was started by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi when he said in a tweet on Monday, Dr
 ambedkar ne jammu evam kashmir main anuchhed 370 lagane kaa virodh kiya tha or is anuchhed ke chalate simavarti rajya (jammu evam kashmir) main na mandal ayog kii report lagu ho pai, na daliton-pichhadon ko reserveshan kaa laabh mil paaya
 According to Sushil Modi, why Prime Minister Narendra Modi has opposed the decision of the party government of Lalu Prasad Yadav, who has become the Messiah of Reservation, when he has cleared the way of reservation by abolishing a temporary Article stigma of Kashmir
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri ne phir BSP supremeo mayawati ke bare main kaha ki jab unhone anuchhed 370 hatane ke saahasik faisle kaa na keval samarthan kiya, balki jammu evam kashmir sarkaar kii anumati ke bina rahul gandhi sahit 11 netaaon ke srinagar jane kaa virodh karte hue saaf kaha ki aisa karne se pehle congress ko is mudde par vichaar karnaa chahie tha
 The BSP chief's assessment is correct that the article which has been deleted after 69 years will take time to end its side effects
 iske baad susheel modi ne lalu prasad yadav ke putr tathaa bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ko gherte hue kaha ki mayawati ke pair chhukar daliton ko pataane kii koshish karne vaale tejasvi yadav ko bataanaa chahie ki vah jammu evam kashmir ke garibon, daliton-pichhadon ko reserveshan se vanchit rakhane vaale anuchhed 370 kaa samarthan kyon kar rahe hai?unhone kaha tha, is mudde par pakistan ko khush karne vaala rukh apanaakar congress to apni kabr khod hi chuki he, RJD jaisi partiyaan uskaa saath dekar apana garib, dalit-pichhadaa janaadhar bhi dafnane kii raah par nikal padi hai
 But responding to this on Tuesday, Shivanand Tiwari said, it seems, Sushil Modi has enrolled in Pragya Thakur's school
 vahiin unhen padhaayaa gaya he ki babasaheb ambedkar kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene vaale samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke virodh main the
 According to Tiwari, the overall writing, speeches, interviews, letter-sheets etc
 of Babasaheb have been published by the Government of Maharashtra in 17 volumes
 unamem kahin bhi anuchhed 370 kaa virodh nahin he
 Babasaheb was an advocate for an early solution to the Kashmir problem through a referendum, and was also in favor of moving the Muslim-majority area to Pakistan
 unka tark tha ki donon deshon ke bich tanaav kii vajah se faujee karch bad rahaa he
 There is also a danger of war between the two countries
 us samay desh ke paas sansadhano kaa gambhir sankat tha
 Babasaheb wanted that the limited resources that we have, should be used in development works
 shivanand ne kaha ki sardaar patel ko lekar bhi susheel modi kii birdari hallaa machaati he
 It is rumored that the country's first Home Minister and Deputy Chief Minister Sardar Patel was opposed to Article 370 and it was only because of the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that this Article was included in the Constitution
 isse bada jhooth doosraa kuch nahin ho saktaa he
 The fact is that on 15 and 16 May 1949, the first meeting of this series was held at the house of Sardar Patel, in which apart from Sardar Patel, Nehruji, Sheikh Abdullah and the Minister of Kashmir Affairs, Mr
 Iyengar were present
 isi baithak main anuchhed 370 par sahmati bani thi
 Then Shivanand Tiwari reminded Sushil Modi that the important thing is that Article 370 was passed from the Constituent Assembly under the leadership of Sardar Patel in the absence of Nehru

 britain main hue janamat sangrah ko lekar bhartiya media kii dilchaspee se kulbulaahat si ho rahi he
 Will the Indian media encourage the idea of a referendum in India as well

 The same question should also be asked to Indians who are settled in Britain and are participating in the referendum there
 kya ve bhartiya netaaon se maang karnaa chahenge ki apane yahaan bhi janamat sangrah hona chahie
 Why does the world's largest and greatest democracy not hold a referendum at the national or state level
 jabaki panchayaton ke str gram sabhaaon kaa system janamat sangrah jaisaa hi to he
 We thought that these questions put up in front of you, but there is also a suggestion
 bharat main janamat sangrah kii baat karte hue jagah or mudde kaa zikr na karen kyonki isse pehle jin logon ne yah kaam kiya he unki puraani kameez syaahi phenk kar or bhi karaab kar di gai he

 Overall, they are being seen from the eyes of Hikrat
 ek aisi bheed ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he jisamen soch samaj kar faisle karne kii kshamta nahin he
 In the political lexicon, the right-wing and sarcastic image of this mob is being projected
 britain ke do bade dal hai
 One Conservative Party and the other Labor Party
 in donon dalon ne iyu main bane rahane kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Some left leaders also voted with the Jamaat diverging from the party line
 live jamaat ko ek raajnneetik or vaicharik rang main rangana sahi hoga kya
 Can it happen that within a few weeks more than half of the population of Britain suddenly becomes racist and right-wing
 britain kii sansad ke 650 saansadon main se 559 saansad to sirf sattadhari conrjarvative or vipakshi dal lebar party ke sadsy hai
 Both of them pleaded not to separate
 aakhir logon ne do dalon ke 559 saansadon ko kyon nahin suna jinhen ve varshon se sunate aae hai
 Did people also reject the Labor Party because in this case Labor and Conservatives had become like one, there is no difference in the economic policies of BJP Congress in India many times
 559 saansadon kii do partiyon kii jagah ek saansad vaali party euke independence party ko itnaa spes kaise mil gaya
 How does its leader, Naizal Paul Faraz, become the representative voice of the Jamaat that breaks away from the EU
 kya isliye ki faraj bhadakaau or betuki baaten karte hai
 Faraj has said that this victory is the victory of common people who are fed up with politics
 wo raajnneeti jo aam aadmi kii kadra nahin karti he
 If you hear Faraj speaking, you will understand that this has happened and continues to happen in India too
 kya faraj jaise netaaon ne british netaaon ke bolne kaa vyakaran badal diya he
 Leaders like Faraz and former mayor Boris Johnson raise questions of political appeasement, fiercely attacking race and migrants
 bibisi se faraj ne kaha ki logon kii chintaa jaays he
 What would you do if a Romanian started coming to your neighborhood? faraj ne kaha he ki agar britain iyu se nikal jayega to auraton par hamale nahin honge kyonki duusare europea deshon se aae log kam ho jaaenge
 Faraz's words are horribly anti-women
 kehete hai ki breast feeding kone main karnaa chahie
 Mothers are less profitable for business than men
 aise logon ko vot kaise mil jaataa he or media main kawarej bhi
 Also know their party programs
 - taxi dryver ke liye unifarm anivaary kiya jayega - mps should have more freedom of their expenditure - train ko paaramparik rangon main phir se paint kiya jaae - British football team should not have more than three foreign players

 duniya bhar main migration ek chunauti he
 But the countries that are advocates of global economy and citizenship, how can they declare people from other countries for work as economic enemies of the country
 duniya ke netaa milakar bolte kyon nahin he is par
 How is this a problem of a leader and a country
 siria, iraq or afghanistan kii samasya kya sharnaarthiyon ne paidaa kii he
 Is the crisis of jobs and wages in Britain only due to refugees, migrants
 tab to ye germany main sabase adhik hona chahie jahaan sabase adhik rifuji gaye hai
 Prior to the referendum in Britain, many large financial institutions and corporates also tried to convince their employees not to decide to secede from the EU, this would hurt their economic interests
 media main bhi is paksh ko lekar khub baat hui hi hogi
 Even then why did people decide to separate
 landan jaisaa vittiya centre iyu ke saath gaya lekin kam bade shahar or gramin kshetron se log alag hone ke faisle ke saath gaye
 If the more affluent and urban working class lived with the EU, then the less affluent and the workers living away from cities went with the separating group
 kya in sabake faisle ko dakshinpanth ke frem main sameta ja saktaa he
 It is generally understood that during the economic crisis the young class becomes blind nationalist, racist and right-wing, but 75 per cent of the voting youth in Britain have voted in favor of remaining in the EU
 inaki umr 18 se 24 saal he
 While most voters between 50 and 65 years of age voted in favor of separation, which according to old Britain has pension facilities, government jobs are
 navaudaravaadi arthvyavastha ke sankaton ke kaaran agar yah ansatosh failaa he to vahaan ke logon or media ne yah kyon nahin poocha ki faraj yaa johnson netaaon ke paas arthvyavastha kaa koun sa doosraa model he
 In which there will not be such crisis
 sabko naukari milegi
 Do right-wing parties across Europe have any economic ideas different from neo-liberalism
 kya ham ise european union jaise ek aisi sanstha ke sankat se samajhane kaa prayaas kar sakate hai
 Britain has never accepted the EU in its heart, but is it not true that more than half of the laws in Britain are applicable only by the framing of the EU

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed regret over Britain's decision and said that the EU should maintain relations with Britain
 unhone kaha ki uthalputhal ke is daur main shanti or sanyam se kaam lenaa hoga
 The EU is the largest economic region in the world
 jo suraksha or sthayitv kii guarantee detaa he
 According to Merkel, the EU is a unique community
 kahin samasya iyu ke dhaanche main to nahin he
 He could unite the European market but could not fulfill different national aspirations
 britain kaa nikalnaa kya yah kah rahaa he ki aarthik aadhaar par global naagarikta gadhane kaa abhiyaan sankat main pad saktaa he
 My grip on European Union politics is less, then we want to try to understand whether it is possible to take the power to make economic policies from a nation and give it to an institution and that the work of the nation is coming from elsewhere Keep applying, even if they are made for the good of all
 agar yah aadhaar he to duniya ke kis desh main vaishvik vittiya sansthaaon kii banaai gai nitiyaan lagu nahin ho rahi hai
 If there is a flaw in the EU, then should it be understood that this artificial corporation of European nationalism can no longer run
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa iyu ke astitv par pehle bhi sakant aae hai or vah unase niklaa he
 The elite intellectuals are laughing at Britain's decision
 bharat ke buddhijivi hans rahe hai ki loktantr ke naam par bheedtantr ne moorkhtapurna faisla kar liya
 Are we really living in some silly phase where kutarka has become the main argument

 Wouldn't it be ego to say so
 britain ke pradhanmantri david camran ne janamat sangrah ke faisle ko sweekaar kiya he
 They were not in favor of leaving the EU

 bharat ke netaa jab istipha dete hai to ve parivaar ke saath nahin hote
 Surrounded by supporters and tables

 The wives of our leaders can be seen with the leader at the time of Griha Pravesh or Karva Chauth
 mujhe acha laga ki jab camran istipha de rahe the tab unki patni ek dost kii tarah khadi thim
 Scotland's First Minister has said that Scotland can again hold a referendum on the question of separation from Britain
 isi april main sweden main ek survey hua tha jisamen iyu se alag hone kii baat nakaar di gai thi
 There was also a question in that, what would they do if they left Britain, then the number of people separated from the EU in that survey was high
 bazaar jo alag alag kaarnon se har duusare tisare din girtaa hi rahata he, shuukravaar ko kuch zyada bharbhara gaya
 All currencies began to tremble and there was an uproar in the stock markets up to India
 aisa laga ki britain sirf iyu se nahin, puri duniya se nikal kar chand par chalaa gaya he
 Is there some new kind of buzz about language, culture and nationalism in Europe, which the established and power-ridden politics is unable to say? Has the illusion of everyone getting equal opportunity broken in the current economy? Are the poor now seeing why the rich are getting richer? Can we see this decision of Britain as a mandate against the prevailing economy around the world? Would it be right to see this decision in a right-wing frame? But before that i want to read a statement of the newly elected Mayor of London which came after the decision of referendum
 'main landan main rahane vaale sabhi europea nagarikon ko saaf saaf sandesh dena chahta hum ki aap sabhi kaa yahaan swaagat he
 As a city thank you for all your contributions and that is not going to change because of this referendum
 aaj kii taarikh main landan main das lakh european naagarik rahete hai or wo hamaare shahar main apane shram, tex or samay ke alaava naagarik or saanskrithik jivan ko samrudh karte hai
 It is our responsibility to fill the division that has taken place during this entire campaign
 hamen un baton par focus karnaa he jo hamen jodatii he
 Not on what breaks us
 ' Britain has two large parties
 ek conservative party or doosraa lebar party
 Both these parties supported their stay in the EU
 kuch vam netaaon ne party line se alag hokar iyu se alag hone vaali jamaat ke saath matdaan bhi kiya
 Is it right to paint a live Jamaat in a political and ideological color? kya aisa ho saktaa he ki kuch hi hafton main britain kii aadhi se adhik aabaadi achaanak naslbhedi or dakshinpanthi ho jaae
 Of the 650 mps of the UK Parliament, 559 mps are members of the ruling Conservative and opposition Labor Party only
 in donon ne alag na hone kii apil kii thi
 After all, why did not people listen to the 559 mps of the two parties whom they have been listening to for years
 kya isliye logon ne lebar party ko bhi riject kiya kyonki is maamle main lebar or conservative ek se ho gaye the jaise bharat main kai baar bijepi congress kii aarthik nitiyon main koi antar nahin dikhataa
 How did the UK Independence Party, a party with one MP, get so much space instead of two parties of 559 mps? iske netaa nijal paul faraj kaise iyu se alag hone vaali jamaat kii pratinidhi awaz ban jate hai
 Is it because Faraj talks inflammatory and absurd
 faraj ne kaha he ki yah jeet un aam logon kii jeet he jo raajnneeti se tang aa gaye hai
 Politics that does not value the common man
 aap faraj ko bolte sunenge to samaj jaayenge ki bharat main bhi aisa hua he or ho rahata he
 Have leaders like Faraz changed the grammar of speaking of British leaders
 faraj or purv meyar boris johnson jaise netaa raajnneetik tushtikaran ke sawaal uthaate hai, nasl or pravaasiyon par jamkar hamale karte hai
 Faraj told the BBC that people's concerns are justified
 agar koi romanian aapke pados main aakar rahane lage to aap kya karenge
 Faraj has said that if Britain leaves the EU, there will be no attacks on women because people from other European countries will be reduced
 faraj kii baaten bhayanak rup se stri virdohi hai
 It is said that breast feeding should be done in the corner
 jo maa hoti hai wo mardon kii tulana main bijness ke liye kam phydemand hoti hai
 How do such people get votes and the media coverage too
 inaki party ke kaarykram bhi jaan lijie
 - Uniform will be made compulsory for taxi driver - saansadon ko unke karche kii zyaada azaadi honi chahie - Re-paint the train in traditional colors - british footbal team main teen se zyada videshi khilaadi na hon
 Such malicious things are being said and happening in India
 koi samskruti ke bahaane to koi kisi khaas subject ke bahaane sabko ek khaas tarah kii drill karne ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 Worldwide migration is a challenge
 lekin jo mulk global arthvyavastha or naagarikta ke himachati hai wo kaam ke liye duusare desh se aae logon ko kaise mulk kaa aarthik dushman ghoshit kar sakate hai
 Why don't the leaders of the world speak together? ye ek netaa or ek mulk kii samasya kaise he
 What refugees have created the problem of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan? britain main naukariyon or mazaduri kaa sankat kya sirf sharnaarthiyon, pravaasiyon ke kaaran he
 Then it should be the highest in Germany where most refugia have gone

 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra party ke liye boj ban gaye hai
 The economic news paper 'the Economic Times' concludes this
 raibareli ke log wadra kii vah shandaar motor cycle raily ko bhoolatey nahin jo unhone 2012 main nikaali thi
 He played an active role in the assembly elections
 vah raily raibareli or amethi kii simaaon main hui thi or chunaav ayog ne uskaa sangyaan liya tha kyonki usamen dedh sau cycle savaaron ne hissaa liya tha jabaki anumati mili thi sirf 10 ko
 By the way, the people there liked that rally because the colorful motorcycles were seen running in it
 lekin wadra kaa rajaniti main pravesh congress ke kisi kaam nahin aayaa or party raibareli-amethi kshetra main 10 main se saat vidhansabha siton par haar gai
 Vadra, of course, rallied to Shanadar but did not appear there since he was named in the land scam last year
 ek tarah se vah party par ek raajnneetik boj ban gaye
 There, a party member said that he had become a thorn in the throat which could not be swallowed and could not be blown up
 congress jo kai muddon par hamale jhel rahi he, uski pareshaani wadra ne or badha di he
 a Congress leader said that although Priyanka ji is strongly refuting the allegations leveled against her, only the workers on the ground will have to defend them
 ab tak to ham 2ji or kolgate ghotaalon ke bare main janata ko aashwast karne main lage hue the ki inamen yatharth kam or baaten zyada hai
 But what to explain to people about Vadra
 ek anya party sadsy ne kaha ki bijepi ke is aarope kaa khandan karnaa mushkil he ki wadra ne ek lakh rupee se 300 karod rupee banaae or vah bhi bahut kam samay main
 He said that the party should have separated him long ago
 raibareli or amethi ke log gandhi parivaar se kaaphi sneh rakhte hai lekin wadra ke bare main vahaan logon kii raay us tarah kii nahin he
 Most people do not even want to talk about them
 ek varisht congressi netaa ne kaha ki priyanka wadra ke bare main kabhi baaten nahin karatin
 This is the first time he has defended them

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday that Kashmir is not an issue in Pakistan's relations
 ek divasiy daure par pathankot pahunche singh ne kaha ki hamaara mudda paak adhikrut kashmir he or ab padosi mulk se usee silsile main baat hogi
 Rajnath Singh reached Pathankot to attend a seminar organized after the completion of two years of the Singhmodi government
 is dauraan apane sambodhan main grih mantri ne kaha, 'pakistan ke saath kashmir kabhi hamaara mudda ho hi nahin saktaa
 Our issue is pok
 ab paak ke saath jo bhi baat hogi vah kashmir par nahin balki pioke par hogi
 "the PAK has to prove that it is anti-terror"
 Regarding the Pathankot attack, Rajnath Singh said that Pakistan should give the NIA a chance to come to its country for investigation
 yah uske aatank virdohi hone kaa subut hoga
 Otherwise, the world will call it a terror-friendly country
 grih mantri ne kaha kipthankot hamaleke maamle me agar pakistan bharat ko jaanch karne kaa mauka nahin detaa to iskaa matlab hoga usne bharat ke saath dhokhaa kiya
 He has to prove that he is not a terrorist advocate
 'koi maai kaa laal aarope nahin laga saktaa'grih mantri ne kaha ki centre sarkaar deshavaasiyon ke aan-baan or shaan par kabhi aanch nahin aane degi
 Referring to the achievements of the Modi government, he said, 'we know that the first step towards development is security
 har naagarik ko yah mahasoos hona chahie ki vah surakshit he
 The border needs to be protected
 ' rajnath singh ne aage kaha, 'jab bhi hamaari sarkaar rahi he, koi bhi maai kaa laal hamaare upar bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin laga sakaa
 ' samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne apni saajhedaari ko aage badhaate hue uttar pradesh ke baad madhya pradesh or uttarakhand main bhi gathbandhan karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Now both the parties will contest the Lok Sabha elections simultaneously in these two states as well
 uttar pradesh kii hi tarj par in rajyon main bhi siton ke maamle main basapa ne baaji maar lee he
 Of the 29 Lok Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh, the BSP will field candidates in 26 seats and the SP in just 3 seats
 uttarakhand ke kul 5 loksabhaa kii siton main se basapa 4 siton par or sapa 1 seat par ladegi
 Both parties have distanced themselves from the Congress for the Lok Sabha elections in these states
 haalanki, in rajyon main sapa or basapa kii upasthiti pratikatmak hi he
 In the last Lok Sabha election 2014, BSP and SP could not win any seat in Lok Sabha in these states
 in donon partiyon kaa kul vot share madhya pradesh main 2
 Has been around 3 percent
 saath hi, soobe main ladaai sidhe bhaajapa or congress ke bich hi he
 Significantly, in the last Lok Sabha election 2014, BJP won 27 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 vahi congress ko keval 2 siton par jeet mili thi
 On the other hand, BJP won all the 5 Lok Sabha seats in Uttarakhand
 in donon partiyon ke gathjod se aakhir kis party kaa khel kharaab hoga? asal main sapa or basapa kaa votbank kamobesh vahi he jo congress kaa he
 In such a situation, the electoral arithmetic of the Congress can be spoiled by joining hands of these two parties in Madhya Pradesh
 2018 main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main madhya pradesh main bahujan samaaj party ko do siton or samaajawaadee party ko ek seat par jeet hasil hui thi
 Talking about the same vote percentage, BSP 5 percent and SP 3
 2 mat mili the
 Both the parties fought separately in the assembly elections
 in donon partiyon ke saath aade se uttar pradesh main bhale hi maamla bhaajapa ke khilaaf dikh rahaa ho, par madhya pradesh or uttarakhand main yah bhaajapa ke paksh main bhi kaam kar saktaa he
 The BJP can directly benefit from the opposition votes, especially the Congress

 Literature Aaj Tak's second season 'ek Chand Hai sir-e-aakash' was attended by big names, poet, critic and writer Shams ur Rehman Farooqui and poet and writer Prem Kumar Nazar in the world of Urdu
 is satr kaa sanchaalan ahamed mahfuz ne kiya
 Prem Kumar Nazar started Guftagu saying that there was a time when Dr
 samual johnson ko angreji adab kaa dictator samajha jaataa tha
 And when i remember this thing, Farooqi Sahib remembers me instantly
 inaki haisiyat bhi ek litereri dictator kii tarah he
 When he started the work of Tankeed (criticism) 55-60 years ago, then people were shocked, surprised who was born who is extracting such things
 to main ye baat sidhe faruki sahab se poochna chahta hum ki us samay aapane bahut likhaa ki ye puraane jamaane kii tanakid ab kisi kaam kii nahin rahi
 So what difference did you feel, what did you miss and why did you consider what you wrote, new? On this question, Shamsur Rahman Farooqui said with great respect that i saw my friend Nazar after a long time
 unhone kaha ki ye buudhe to ho gaye hai, lekin itane buudhe nahin, jitna aap log samaj rahe hai
 His health is still very young
 faruki ne sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki abhi tak mere saamne urdu kii jo aalochana he, wo mujhe janchati nahin he
 i do not have comfort with that
 masalaa ye he ki gaalib ko mir se kaise alag kar sakate hai
 He said that the things that were done about Mir and Ghalib can be done for anyone
 aalochana main aisi baaten kahana bahut aasaan he
 Find any four or five jumlas
 farukhi ne kaha ki aamtaur par aalochana main unheen shabdon ko ghuma-phiraa kar lagbhag ek jaisi chizon kisi ke bare main kah diya jaataa he or yah aalochana ek kaarobaar ban kar rah gai he
 Referring to one incident, Farooqui said that i was in a seminar
 to vahaan ek sahab kisi or ke liye jo majamoon padhanaa tha, wo kisi or ke liye pard gaye
 That is, earlier this tankeed was for just saying
 unhone kaha ki us daur main jis tarah se tanakid kii jaati thi, usase main bahut dukhi tha
 Saying these things, i am not calling myself very knowledgeable Urdu
 lekin is tarah jo baaten kii jaati thim ye satahi thim
 Then it was said to anyone that Mr
 Phalanam is very delicate
 do logon ke liye yahi kah diya jaae ki wo bahut najku khyaali the, to donon main antar kya hua
 Then say the same thing for Mir and also for Ghalib
 faruki ne kaha ki jo baaten litereri culture main pehle maujuud thim, wo baaten shaayar yaa riter or sunne vaale main bahut saaf thim
 They understood what i was saying and what they were listening to
 phir jamaana badla
 Those relationships weakened
 phir ek or musiibat aa gai
 Such schools and colleges opened in which everything started to be taught
 hamaare yahaan urdu or hindi sahitya us samay padhaayaa jane laga tha, jab landan uniwarsity main angreji tak nahin padhai jaati thi
 In 1880, Oxford started an English course
 faruki ne mir-nazeer or premchand tak ko ek hi tarah se bataane kii majammat kii
 He said that they were all different types
 lekin sabhi ko thode bahut badlaav kar bataa diya jaataa tha
 i cannot say such a difference
 to maine sochaa ki main khud likhakar dekhtaa hum
 The kind of Hindi and Urdu literature that was going on in our boyhood
 us daur ko progressive movement bhi kehete the
 People came before me with another agenda
 tab maine bahut bahes kii
 LIVE: Sahitya Aaj Tak 2018- Malini Awasthi asked on the question of journalization and modularization of Ganga Shaktis of Bahá'í devotion, Prem Kumar asked Farooqui that at times it seems that Mir has not said this yet you have said it
 is par faruki ne kaha ki mir ke sher ko bhi baandh diya jaataa tha
 People used to change the context in which they used to say lion
 masalan
 
 
 Mir with the boys of Amirzadas, that we are poor because of their wealth
 to daulat kaa matlab logon ne dhan-daulat se nikaal liya jo ki galat he
 Daulat here means by virtue of that
 lekin ise daulat se jod diya gaya
 Jafri Saheb said that it has been said about the poor and rich sections, whereas it was not so
 faruki ne kaha ki hamaare ek ustad ne mir ke sellection se ladakiyon se chhedchhad vaale saare sher nikaal die
 So when you are not looking at the whole Mir, then how can you tell about them rightly
 faruki ne naseehat di ki agar aap shaayar ko bada maanate hai to use puraa padhie
 Why did Piyush Mishra leave Rajshri's 'I have made love'? Farooqui said that while writing a poet, one cannot say that this lion will be finished in 10 years whether in 100 years or else it will remain in this country or other countries
 i will also go achche shaayar kaa kamaal ye hota he ki wo usamen bahut sari aisi baaten daal detaa he jisase kai matlab nikaale ja sakate hai
 It is a big identity of a big poet that he means different to his lion every time
 unhone udhaaharan dete hue ek sher sunaaya-jahaan main mir se kaahe ko hote hai paidaa

 Slippery Rajpath: Indira Dangi, Rajpal Publications, Rs 265 yaa agar yah sach na bhi ho to dilli ke duurastha kendron main hindi sahitya kii ban rahi yah chhavi lekhakon-sampadakon or aalochakon ke liye chintaa kaa vishay honi chahie
 This image states that the skepticism of the literary fraternity has increased
 upanyaas par lauten
 The hero comes from his village to a big city - gets a journalism job, but eventually stumbles from here and returns to his home
 apni nijee or lekhkeey pahchaan ke bich kaa antardvandv lagaataar uske bheetar he
 He wants to get into literature by hiding his surname
 jis dalit ladki se prem karata he
 Marries her
 lekin ek din phir sahitya main paanv jamaane kii tamanna main sab kuch chhodkar nikal padataa he
 This time he is in Delhi
 yahaan aakar vah paata he ki raajnneeti bhi badi ho gai he, apmaan bhi baarik ho gaye hai
 And finally he understands that if he survives or becomes, then only by his writing
 yah ek sarthak ant he
 However, before reaching this end, the story is also stray
 charitron ke vikaas or ghatnaon ke vistaar main kahin-kahin hadabadi nazar aati he
 Many of the reactions of the novel's hero, Virat, do not create credibility
 isi tarah kuch bahut samvedansheel drishyon kaa chithran kamazor pad jaataa he
 For example, seeing his mentor bullying a young poetess, the hero-disciple's response comes in a whole sentence - 'are you raping Guruji?' And instead of shame or remorse, a villainous attitude appears within Guruji
 guru or shishy donon yahaan filmi dikhte hai or donon kii pratikriyaayein baad main bilkul bejaan maaloom padati hai
 The question is, why does this happen? Why does a skilled narrator like Indira Dangi suddenly seem to miss here? Probably because the sensation of which she is sitting to write the story itself falls under her arrest
 upanyaas main ghatnaon ke byore jas ke tas daalane kii chahat use kamazor karti he
 The truth is that this is the big question of our time - how can a Dalit writer make his place in the otherwise confined world of Hindi? Or why this kind of mediocrity is dominated in Hindi writing and criticism
 hindi main likhane kii apni traasad parinatiyaan lekhak ke pathakavihin or becheharaa rah jane se shuru hokar prakaashan or puraskaar ke gathjod tak pahunchati hai jo antat: lekhan ko bhi kshatigrast karti hai
 The continuing squabble in his name is an important issue amidst the ever increasing inevitability of Dalit and female discourse
 magar lekhika is gaharaai tak utarane kaa dhiraj nahin dikhaati
 She is limited to the details above
 kahin-kahin kuch laaparvaah si tippaniyan chali aati hai
 For example, Mannu Bhandari married Rajendra Yadav in his wish for fame - this propaganda is both shocking and sad
 hindi main jo log yah dharna failaa rahe hai, ve ek sankeern drushti kaa parichay de rahe hai
 The comments 'craft' indira dangi kaa priy shabd lagata he, jiskaa ve kai arthon main istemaal karti hai
 But the 'craft' of the novel breaks
 apni simaaon kii vajah se 'rapatile rajpath' ek mahatvapurn upanyaas banate-banate rah jaataa he
 It becomes an ongoing novel written with the desire to become popular
 beshak, lekhika ke paas kissagoi kii jo kshamta he, vah use rapatane se bachaa leti he
 The intervening passages are good and sensitive, but the novel does not leave a big impact in its entirety
 rapatile rajpath: indira dangi, raajapaal prakaashan, 265 rupee Return to the novel
 nayak apane gaanv se bade shahar aata he- patrakarita kii naukari paata he, lekin antat: yahaan se thokar khaakar phir apane ghar lautataa he
 The conflict between his personal and authorial identity is constantly within him
 vah apana sarnem chupa kar sahitya main jamana chahta he
 The dalit girl he loves
 usase vivaah karata he
 But one day again, leaving everything in the desire to set foot in literature, it comes out
 is baar vah dilli main he
 Coming here, he finds that politics has become too big, insults have also become finer
 or antat: yah samajhataa he ki agar vah bachegaa yaa banegaa to apane lekhan se hi
 This is a meaningful end
 haalanki is ant tak pahunchane se pehle katha bhatki bhi he
 The development of the characters and the expansion of events can be seen at some length
 upanyaas ke nayak viraat kii kai pratikriyaayein vishwasaneeyata paidaa nahin karatin
 Similarly, the depiction of some very sensitive scenes weakens
 masalan, apane guru ko ek yuva kavyitri ke saath jor-jabardastee karata dekh, nayak-shishy kii pratikriya ek puure vaakya main aati he- 'aap balaatkaar kar rahe hai guruji?' or guruji ke bheetar shame yaa pachhataave kii jagah ek khalnaayakeey tevar dikhaai padataa he
 Both the Guru and the disciple appear filmy here and the reactions of both seem absolutely lifeless later
 sawaal he, aisa kyon hota he? indira dangi jaisi kushal kathakaar achaanak yahaan chookti kyon prathit hoti he? shaayad isliye ki jis sansani kii kahani vah likhane baithi he, khud uski giraft main aa jaati he
 Just like the details of events in the novel weaken her
 sach to yah he ki yah hamaare samay kaa bada sawaal he- hindi kii anyathaa simati duniya main ek dalit lekhak apni jagah kaise bana saktaa he? yaa hindi lekhan or aalochana main ausatapan kaa is qadar bolbalaa kyon he
 Its tragic culminations of writing in Hindi begin with the writer being readerless and uninterested, reaching a nexus between publication and awards that ultimately damages the writing as well
 dalit or stri vimarsh kii lagaataar majboot ho rahi aprihaaryta ke bich inke naam par jari vidrup ek ahm mudda he
 But the writer does not show the patience to get down to this depth
 vah upar ke byoron tak simit rah jaati hai
 Some careless comments sometimes come
 masalan, mannu bhandari ne rajendra yadav se kisi prasiddhi kii kaamana main vivaah kiya tha- yah dushprachaar chaunkaata bhi he or udhaas bhi karata he
 Those who are spreading this notion in Hindi are presenting a narrow vision
 tippaniyan 'craft' seems to be the beloved word of Indira Dangi, which she uses in many ways
 lekin upanyaas kaa 'craft' tuutata he
 Due to its limitations, 'raptile Rajpath' continues to be an important novel
 vah charchit hone kii kaamana ke saath likhaa gaya ek chaalu upanyaas ban jaataa he
 Of course, the writer has the ability to tell the story, which saves him from sliding
 bich-bich ke ansh achche or samvedansheel hai, magar samagrata main upanyaas bada prabhaav nahin chodta
 Slippery Rajpath: Indira Dangi, Rajpal Publications, Rs 265 yah ek sarthak ant he

 The importance of Sun worship and its benefits are also found in mythological stories
 mana gaya he ki surya ko roj jal chadhaane se swasthya thik rahata he or ghar main sampannataa aati he
 According to the legend, according to the legend of Mahabharata, Karna worshiped the sun regularly and offered water to the sun
 surya kii pujake bare main bhagwaan ram kii bhi katha milti he ki vah bhi har din surya ko jal dekar unki puja karte the
 It is also said in the scriptures that every dinosaur should be burnt and many people also follow this rule
 surya bhagwaan kii krupa paane ke liye karen ravivaar kaa vrath
 
 
 Come, know the benefits of giving water to the sun
 
 
 1
 In Jyoti Shastra, Sun is described as a factor of soul
 isliye aatm shuddhi or aatmbal badhaane ke liye niyamit rup se surya ko jal dena chahie
 2
 surya ko niyamit jaldene se sharir urjavan banataa he or kaaryakshetra main iskaa laabh miltaa he
 3
 agar aapaki naukari main pareshaani ho rahi he to niyamit rup se surya ko jal dene se ucchadhikariyon se sahyog milane lagata he or mushkilen dur ho jaati hai
 4
 surya ko jaldene ke liye tambe ke paatr kaa upyog karnaa behatar rahata he
 5
 surya ko jal dene se pehle jal main chutki bhar roli milaayein or laal phool ke saath jal den
 After this, give water 7 times while giving water and chant the mantra of sun

 There are instances when decisions have been purchased

 i know that i can be sued for saying this
 lekin yah jarur kahuungi or yah kehane ke liye main jail jane ko taiyaar hum
 He also questioned the discretion of judicial commissions
 mamata ne kaha, 'kai nyaayik ayog gathit kiye gaye lekin parinaam kahaan he? in aayogon par kaaphi dhan kharch kiye gaye lekin unhone keval ucchadhikariyon se baat kii or kuch nahin kiya

 mamata ke is tippanee kii tikhi aalochana hui he
 Advocate of the Calcutta High Court, Arunabha Ghosh said that Mamata is suffering from harassment and frustration and her remarks are similar to criminal contempt of court
 arunabha ne kaha, 'vah is tarah nyaaypalika ko badnaam nahin kar saktin
 This is certainly a criminal contempt of court

 In this letter, he also targeted PM Modi fiercely
 bhagwant maanane apni chitthee se pradhanmantri ko nishaanaa banaate hue likhaa ki pradhanmantri ne usee ISI ko pathankoth airbase main ghumaya, jisane 2001 main sansad par hamalaa kiya tha
 Bhagwant Mann has asked the question of Neloksabhaspeaker that if the ISI made the maps of the airbase, did not the security of the entire country be threatened? Defending himself, Bhagwant Mann writes about who is threatening the security of the country, by making my videos or by rotating the Pathankot airbase to the ISI? Tell you that in the case of Bhagwant Mann, the committee has to report by August 3

 Cricket world reactions on Kuldeep Yadav's brilliant performance dilli gangrape maamle main pehali sajaa suna di gai he
 Being asked whether this punishment is also a punishment? The crime was not less than a felony and the punishment was only 3 years
 keval isliye, kyonki apradhi naaballig tha
 The minor is also such that he was just a few days younger than 18 years
 ek sawaal or bhi he
 That is why even in the rarest of the rare cases, the maximum punishment for the minor criminal is only 3 years? pataa chalaa ki aparaadh chaahe kitna bhi jaghanya kyon na ho, bal apradhi (juvenil) ko adhiktam sajaa 3 saal kii hi ho sakati he
 It is an obligation of Indian law
 yahi nahin, yah sajaa sanyukt raashtra ke praavdhaanon ko dekhte hue bhi di gai he
 This rule is followed in most countries
 kanoonon main sanshodhan kii jarurat he: keties tulsisupreme court ke jane-maane vakil keties tulsi ne bataaya ki bal aparaadh ke maamalon main zyada se zyada sajaa teen saal kii he
 Regardless of the crime, the law does not classify the crime in such cases
 tulsi ne bataaya ki yadi aayu 18 saal se ek minute bhi kam he to apradhi ko praavdhaanon ke tahat laabh miltaa he
 Video: The victim's friend heard the tragedy of that black night
 
 
 tulsi kaa kahana he ki ab juvenil kanoonon main sanshodhan kii jarurat he
 Parliament should amend the law and reduce the age of minor from 18 to 16
 unhone tark diya ki pichley 5 saalon main juvenil aparaadh ke aankade kaaphi chaunkaane vaale rahe hai
 Between 16 and 18, there has been a 43 percent increase in the number of people committing crimes (murder, rape and others)
 hatya or balaatkaar jaise maamalon main bal aparaadh zyada teji se badha he
 The age of these juveniles is between 16 and 18 years
 padhein:peedita ke dost ne sunaaya 'wo' khaufnak manjar
 
 
 Maximum punishment of juvenile crime should be increased: Mahesh Jethmalani Another senior lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani said that the decision in Delhi gang rape case has been taken as per the provisions
 lekin ab vakt aa gaya he ki kanoon main badlaav kiya jaae
 The maximum sentence, which is still 3 years, should be increased for all juvenile offenses
 padhein kya hua tha 16 disambar kii kaali raat ko
 
 
 
 'samaaj kii niti or niyat main badlaav kii jarurat'supreme court ke anya vakil or maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta colin gonsalvis ne kaha ki kanoon apni jagah par sahi he
 Society and government are also responsible for the increase in child crimes
 sajaa badhaane kii jagah samaaj kii niti or niyat main badlaav kii jarurat he
 According to the police, the situation is dangerous
 Police officials say that many organized crimes are taking place in India by taking advantage of the Juvenile Act
 kai aise giroh hai, jo 16 se 18 saal kii umr tak ke bacchon se aparaadh karaate hai
 Instead, children are given money
 kanoon kaa laabh in bacchon ko miltaa he or ye jaldi chhot jate hai
 If someone commits the same crime, then it is possible to sentence him to life imprisonment
 police kii is baat par yakeen isliye kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki pichley kuch saalon main bal aparaadh ke maamle pehle kii bajaay bahut adhik hone lage hai
 It can be said that the methods of committing crimes have changed, so now there is a great need to change the law
 kabhi hamase dur nahin hoga '16 disambar' kaa gam

 Little does Pran, who left an impression of strong acting among the audience not want to be an actor, know that he wanted to become a photographer, not an actor, but fate had something else in mind for him
 praan kii filmon main aane kii koi yojana nahin thi

 uskaa sheershak 'praan and praan' rakhaa gaya he
 The title of the book is so named that in most of Pran's films, his name was written behind all the actors
 kabhi-kabhi unke naam ko is tarah pesh kiya jaataa tha 'abav ol praan'
 Pran Sikand was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the art field by the Government of India in the year 2001
 praan kii antim yatra main umadi mayanagari | sab chhod gaye pranfilmphere puraskaar se sammanitiske baad unhone 'upkaar' (1967), 'aansu ban gaye phool' (1969) or 'beyimaan' (1972) ke liye praan ko sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinayta kaa filmphere puraskaar mila
 He was also awarded the Filmfare Life Time Achievement title in 1997
 varsh 2013 main unhen film jagat ke sarvocch sammaan dada sahib phalke sammaan bhi pradaan kiya gaya

 varsh 1998 main praan main dil kaa daura padaa tha
 At the time, he was 78 years old, yet he had thrown his death, but on July 12, 2013, he walked away saying goodbye to all
 praan bhale hi aaj hamaare bich nahin hai, lekin apane damdaar abhinay ke kaaran vah hameshaa ham sabake dil main based rahenge

 com / 0j5qzvzhhtrauwa ne kaha, ''ramalala raajnneeti kaa vishay nahin hai balki aasthaa kaa masalaa hai
 We did not ask for votes in the name of Ram nor will we ask for it in future
 jab vah (uddhav) november main ayodhya aaye the to chunaav baad phir aane kaa vaada kiya tha
 He is fulfilling his promise
 '' ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke bare main raut ne kaha, ''modi or yogi ke netritv main iskaa nirmaan hoga

 Your whatsapp may be under government watch
 bahut mumkin he ki aap watsape chat man mutabik delit na kar paaen
 Actually, the government has formulated a policy
 neshnal encripshan policy
 Under this, you will not be able to delete chats for whatsapp or other encrypted messaging service for 90 days
 90 din tak aapako use seve rakhana padegaa
 The country had more than 70 million whatsapp users till last year
 watsape ke alaava google hangout or apple kaa imasej bhi iske daayre main aate hai
 This policy has been prepared by the Ministry of Information Technology
 16 oktober tak aam logon se is par suzav maange hai
 Know its 10 special things
 1
 This agreement with the government will be mandatory for service providers in India or outside India who are using encryption technology in India
 2
 There are also several 'strictly unofficial' groups running on whatsapp
 90 din tak seve rakhane kii yah niti aise sabhi gaiyr-aadhikarik yaa nijee sandeshon par bhi lagu hogi
 3
 yah niti apane maujuuda swaroop main lagu hoti he or watsape, google yaa imasej yah samjhauta nahin karte hai to unhen gaiyrkanoonee yaa avaidh tehraaya ja saktaa he
 4
 aap 90 din se pehle encripted massej delit kar dete hai to ise gaiyrkanoonee mana jayega
 On request from a government agency, you have to show the plain text
 5
 Business will also have to save encrypted messages and plain text of all your communication
 maangane par apana encripshan password sarkaar se saajha karnaa hoga
 6
 sarkaar hi tay karegi ki kaisaa encripshan product istemaal kiya jaae
 That is, if your favorite app used another encryption, it would become invalid
 7
 It will be mandatory for every app to register with a government agency and submit a working copy of its encryption software or hardware to the agency
 8
 In 2010, the government also said that it would ban BBM (blackberry Messenger Service) in India
 tab use bhi sarkaar se aisa hi samjhauta karnaa padaa tha
 9
 visheshgy is policy ko khatarnaak bataa rahe hai, kyonki isse encripted massej tak haikaron kii pahunch aasaan ho jaaegi or logon ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 10
 zyaadaatar yugers ko yah maaloom hi nahin hota ki unka plane text kab encripted massej main badal jaataa he or ve uskaa istemaal karne lagate hai
 What happens: Encryption: Encryption is a type of lock within which your data is most secure
 kisi encripted file ko aap tabhi pard sakate hai jab aapke paas uskaa password ho
 With that password, it is decrypted and converted to plain text
 smart card, sim card sabhi encripshan kaa istemaal karte hai
 Now there can be no doubt that after Indira Gandhi, Narendra Modi is our most powerful political figure
 thodaa or gaharaai main jaaen to yah kah sakate hai ki ve ab tak ke sabase dabang or aavegpurn netaa hai
 In the context of Margaret Thatcher, the definition of an impulsive leader was that of a leader who walks by his own belief and has nothing to do with common opinion
 iske alaava,modihamaare sabase achche vaktaa bhi hai
 You can complain in Parliament about their lack of speaking or not answering questions directly, but in an environment they are highly verbose
 ek baar jab ve apane shrota chun lete hai to apane bhaashan se aisa samaa baandhte hai ki hamane aaj tak is desh main nahin dekha
 Vajpayee was a great orator, but he was not always like this
 unhone kabhi bhi apane vichaaron yaa phir vichaardhaara kaa prachaar karne ke liye kisi bade manch kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 During the last week, Modi has assured us twice about such qualities: first in the address of Independence Day and second in his speech among the overseas Indian community of Bardubai
 dilli ke laal kile se die unke bhaashan ko jaan-boojhkar zyada tavajjo nahin di gai
 Hearing this, it felt as if a long distance driver was trying to handle his car
 is baar koi nayaa nuskhaa nahin uchhaala gaya, to shaayad isliye kyonki pehle die gaye nuskhon, khaskar shauchalay, svachh bharat or mek in india ke maamle main koi khaas pragati dekhne ko nahin mili he
 Despite this, he did not rush to make any announcement in the case of OROP, this fact in itself is a sign of his sharp intellect
 taqatvar netaa ghatnaon ke aadhaar par apni nitiyaan tay nahin karte or aavegpurn netaa dusron kii ummiido ke hisaab se nahin chalate
 Instead, they surprise you
 oropi par chup rahete hue saamaanya or anargal baaten karke modi ne zyaadaatar media ko hairat main daal diya, khaskar un tivi channelon ko jinhone us din jantar mantar par apane camere taan rakhe the
 Strong and impulsive leaders do not allow others to take their stage
 agar modi ne vastav main oropi par koi naatakeey elaan kar diya hota, agar vaaki purv faujee usase santusht ho jate, tab swatantraaa diwas kii sari chamak modi se chhin jaati
 Anyway, what does it mean to make a big occasion a platform to settle someone's grievance? Likewise in Dubai, knowing that this was his first visit to an Islamic country with which India's relationship has been strange — India's tax evaders And Dubai has been a paradise for smuggling gangs, and Dawood Ibrahim, in particular, has been the workplace - he spread his message with great vigor and strength
 unhone vahaan aatankwaad ko pakistan ke samarthan par koi shikaayat nahin kii, uske sangrakshakon yani dubai ke shekhon se is sambandh main koi apil nahin kii or na hi un par unke tareeke badalane kaa koi dabaav jaisaa daalaa
 Just gave a fine message: South Asia is also uniting like Europe, East countries are coming together, in such a way that if Pakistan imposes any obstacle then India will leap to UAE regardless of it
 aise main aap is gol main shaamil hon yaa phir alag-thalag pad jaaen
