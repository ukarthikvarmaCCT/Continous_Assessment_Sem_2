 com / 3muxtdseop jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ke aadesh par shirsalgaavvaadi netaa masarat alam kii rihyper bijepi ne ankhen tarerte hue kaha he ki isse sattadhari gathbandhan ko 'khatra' paidaa ho saktaa he
 At the same time, security forces have also expressed concern that this may endanger the peace of Jammu and Kashmir
 pradesh bijepi kii yuva shakha ke pramukh or naushera se party ke vidhayak ravindra raina ne kaha, 'masarat alam rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatra he kyonki vah koi raajnneetik kaidi nahin balki ek aatankwaadi he
 The BJP will never tolerate his release
 agar aise rashtradrohi, pakistan samarthak netaaon ko reeha kiya jaataa he to gathbandhan sarkaar chalaanaa kaaphi mushkil hoga
 He said, "this alliance will be in danger because we will never accept it
" ' ham bharat virdohi netaa kii rihaai kaa virodh karenge
 Raina said that the release of anti-national leaders was a violation of the Common Minimum Program (CMP) on which a coalition government was agreed to form
 alam kii rihaai ko rashtriya suraksha ke liye 'bada khatra' bataate hue raina ne kaha ki isse jammu-kashmir main aatankwaad bad saktaa he
 He said, 'alam is more dangerous than terrorists
 bijepi iskaa virodh karegi or ham is mudde par nishchit taur par centre sarkaar se baatcheet karenge
 'alam's release threatens security: Security forces have also called Alam's release a threat to the security of Jammu and Kashmir
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha, 'yah suraksha ke liye bada khatra hoga
 This will be a big risk for the peace of Jammu and Kashmir, especially the Kashmir Valley, where Alam staged two large stone-fired demonstrations and killed many people
 ' adhikari ne kaha ki vah saiyad ali shah gilaani se bhi zyada taqatvar netaa he or uske paas patharbaajon or yuvaaon kii badi fouj he
 Input from language cinema kaa or tyoharon kaa aapas main bada jabardast conection he
 In Bollywood, big banners often choose festivals for their films and Holi is the most colorful festival
 holi jaise rangabhre tyohaar main bollywood ke gane masti kaa tadakaa laga dete hai
 Whether it is the song 'go Pagal' from Akshay Kumar's film 'jolly LLB 2' released about a month before Holi, or Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatti's 'badrinath Ki Dulhaniya', released just 2 days before Holi
 The colorful color of Holi has been introduced in both these films at the beginning of the year
 lekin holi ke gaanon kii baat jab bhi aati he to use amitabh bachchan kaa 'rang barase bhiige chunariya', or film sholay kaa 'holi ke din dil mil jate hai' jaise gane apane aap jubaan par chadh jate hai
 We are giving a list of some such songs in front of you, which you will definitely play in your playlist on Holi
 film 'jolly elelbi 2' kaa gaanaa 'go pagal'
 'badrinath Ki Dulhaniya' looked dull in this color
 amitabh bachchan ke gane 'rang barase' ke bina holi kaa rang adhuraa he
 Even after years, Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini's 'hori Khel Raghubira' must be a part of your list
 film 'kati patang' kaa yah gaanaa 'aaj na chodenge' par naachna to jaruri he
 Although Ranbir Kapoor says that he does not like Holi much, but the fun in Ranbir and Deepika Padukone's 'balam Pichkari' in the film 'yeh Jawani Hai Divani' will not let you realize this
 'mere brother kii dulhaniya' kaa gaanaa yun to dhabas par filmaaya gaya ek gaanaa he lekin is gane kii masti aapako holi kii hi yaad dilaaegaa
 This song from the film Der, like 'ang Se Ang Ang Lagana' is a must to play on Holi
 or aakhir main puraani film 'nadiya ke paar' kaa gaanaa 'jogi ji dhire-dhire' par chaahe aap kitna bhi thak jaaen, aapke thirake bina nahin ruk paaenge
 You will remember that dialogue of the film 'sholay', when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 ' to holi kaa yah gaanaa is holi par sunanaa banataa hi he
 The comments to ab in gaanon ke saath masti bhare rang main naachie, gaaiye or holi kaa tyohaar manaaie
 The song 'go Pagal' from the film 'jolly LLB 2'
 'badrinaath kii dulhaniya' kuch is rang main dikhi sarabor
 Holi color is incomplete without Amitabh Bachchan's song 'rang Barse'
 saalon baad bhi amitabh bachchan or hema malini kaa 'hori khelen raghubira' aapaki list kaa hissaa jarur hona chahie
 Dancing on this song of the film 'kati Patang' is not necessary
 haalanki ranbir kapur kaa kahana he ki unhen holi zyada pasand nahin he lekin film 'ye javaani he divaani' main ranbir or deepika padukon kii 'balam pichakaari' main masti aapako is baat kaa ehsaas nahin hone degaa
 The song 'mere Brother Ki Dulhania' is a song filmed on Yun To Dhaba, but the fun of this song will remind you of Holi itself
 dar film kaa yah gaanaa, 'ang se ang lagaana' jaise holi par bajnaa to jaruri he
 And finally, on the song 'jogi ji slowly' from the old film 'nadia Ke Paar', no matter how tired you are, you will not be able to stop without your snort
 film 'sholay' kaa vah dialog to aapako yaad hi hoga, 'holi kab he, kab he holi

 India had a target of 181 runs, but despite the first half-century in Virat Kohli's tour of England, he was able to score 177 runs for five wickets
 dhoni ne kaha, chah gend par 17 ran bananaa hameshaa mushkil hota he
 i hit a four on the first ball
 antim over main maine kam se kam do aise shot ganvaae jin par main boundry jad saktaa tha
 It was a difficult task and it was one of those days when things did not go in your favor
 duusare chor par ambati rayudu the, lekin bhartiya captain ne khud hi jimmedaari lene kaa faisla kiya or bich main ek ran nahin liya
 He said, i felt that the ball was coming in the middle of my bat, so i should take responsibility, but it did not happen
 rayudu usee samay aayaa tha jo genden usne kheli, us par vah balle ke bich se shot nahin khel paaya isliye maine sochaa ki mujhe jimmedaari leni hogi
 Dhoni said, i had decided at the beginning of the over that i would try to finish it
 khud kaa hausala badhanaa mahatvapurn hota he
 Rayudu could also do this, but this is my strength and i take responsibility for it
 bhartiya gendbaaj phir se deth overon main ranon par ankush lagane main naakaam rahe or unhone yarker karne ke bajaay nichi rahati phultos kii
 Dhoni admitted that this was a matter of concern
 unhone kaha, yarker ab bhi chintaa he, lekin praaroop main antar ke baad yah mushkil ban gaya he
 We had three spinners today, so the ball did not rub too much and it is not easy to bowl in the death overs
 lekin jab aap sahi yarker nahin karte to ballebaajon ko jhansa diya ja saktaa tha
 You need to change your line and length, but our bowlers did not improve today
 bharat ne test shrunkhlaa 1-3 se ganvaayi, lekin vanade shrunkhlaa main vah 3-1 se jeet darj karne main safal rahaa
 On the entire tour of two months, Dhoni said, "we had many young players on this tour
" paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa kadi hoti he
 Earlier, none of our players had played a five-test series
 hamane pehle do maichon main acha pradarshan kiya, lekin aakhri teen maichon main ham acha khel nahin dikhaa paae
 After that it was important to do well in odis and we did it
 unhone kaha, daure ke bich main 20
 We could not play good cricket for 25 days
 aisa prayek team ke saath hota
 It is important to learn from the experience here
 iske baad hamen westeindies or australia se khelnaa he or yadi ham yahaan kii sikh vahaan lagu kar sakate he to mujhe khushi hogi

 The government, eager to get the GST Bill passed, has kept the option of re-convening the session open as the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs decided not to prorogue it immediately

 dilli ke sarkari skulon se 1 july 2019 ko baahar kiye ja chuke kareeb 1500 se zyada Non CTET guest teachers ko sarkaar ne ek or mauka diya he
 The All India Guest Teachers Association has thanked the Delhi Government and MP Manoj Tiwari for joining them back in schools, due to whose efforts Non CTET Guest Teachers have once again got employment
 ol india guest teachers association ke sadsy shoeb rana ne bataaya ki lambey samay se sanghathan 60 saal kii policy kii maang kar rahaa tha
 Also, non CTET was struggling to give guest teachers a chance to sit for at least twice
 bataa den, ki dilli sarkaar ke skulon main takreeban 22 hajaar guest teachers padhaa rahe the
 On 11 February 2019, the Education Department issued a circular saying that after this session (2018-19), guest teachers studying in government schools of Delhi will be able to teach in schools only after passing the CTET (central Teachers Eligibility Test) examination
 association ne sarkaar or alji (up rajyapal) se iske liye maang kii thi ki atithi shikshakon ko kam se kam do baar mauka diya jaae
 However, they were not given this opportunity and on 1 July 2019, the names of about 1500 Non CTET Guest Teachers were removed from the online module of the Department of Education, during which, around 1500 Guest Teachers were shown the way out after failing in the seat
 i went
 ye 1500 teachers berozegaar ho gaye the
 Shoaib Rana says that all the guest teachers are grateful to Education Minister, MP Manoj Tiwari and LG Sahab for this step of the government
 unhone students kaa bhavishya or guest teachers ke rojgaar ko dekhte hue Non Ctet guest teachers ko Ctet pass karne kii chhot dete hue uski samay seemaa 31 / 10 / 2019 tak badha di he
 Let us tell you, a large number of Non Ctet Guest Teachers have also passed the CTET exam to be held on 7 July 2019
 ab wo apni jwining kaa intjaar kar rahe he ki district main Non CTET yaa CTET paas guest teachers kii jwining ke liye skulon main mail daal di gai he or jwining ho rahi he
 However, many districts still do not have guidelines by mail for joining NON CTET guest teachers
 isaki vajah se un skulon ke guest teachers kii jwining nahi ho paa rahi he kyonki skulon pramukh kaa saaf taur par kahana he ki jab tak shiksha vibhaag kii taraf se unke skool main koi dishanirdesh nahi aate hai tab tak wo kisi ko bhi joining karaane main asamarth he
 Some guest teachers are still not able to pass CTET exam for which the Education Department has given time till 31 / 10 / 2019 to pass CTET
 sanghathan ne shiksha vibhaag se nivedan kiya he ki jald se jald NON ctet guest teachers ke naam online modul main daal diye jaaen taaki unki jwining jald se jald ho sake
 Also, the request that NON CTET guest teachers to pass CTET should be extended till the upcoming CTET examination, because CTET examination is not proposed to be held till 31 / 10 / 2019

 kyonki riserchars ne microsoft offis main security khamiyaan dhundhi hai jise company ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 Malware sent through it can harm users
 haalanki yah diarect nahin he, balki sender dwaara bheje gaye verde file se aapako dikkat ho sakati he
 Security researchers believe that this bug may cause a problem generated from Microsoft's productivity suite
 yani verde ke sabhi varjan isse prabhavit ho sakate hai
 It also includes Office 2016 for Windows 10
 gauratlab he ki microsoft offis or windos oparating sismat main khatarnaak files ko rokane ke liye bilt in system die jate hai
 But during this attack, hackers can also be able to penetrate those security
 security form pruf point ne isaki jaanch kii or paaya he ki yujar ke verde file kholte hi mailaware apana kaam karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 That is, as soon as the user opens the word file sent for reading, his computer can be infected
 sabase pehle is khami kaa pataa mcafee ke researchrs ne lagaaya
 Although fireeye experts believe that they were aware of this, they first thought it appropriate to inform Microsoft
 Fire Eye ne apane blog post main kaha he, ‘is atake main aise email shaamil hai jisamen verde document atech kiye gaye hote hai
 This is triggered by sending the target user 'windows as soon as the user opens the attached word document
 exe remote sarwar tak HTTP request bhejtaa he
 Server upon request
 hta file bhejtaa he jo farji rich text formet hota he, lekin yugers ko wo bilkul asli jaisaa hi dikhataa he
 By deception, users are forced to click it
 haalanki aisa pehle bhi hota rahaa he ki email atachament ke jariye havers kisi computer par nishaanaa banaate hai
 But the word file is usually considered safe
 isliye is baar dhundhi gai security khami nishchit taur par kisi khatre kii ghanti se kam nahin he
 In simple terms, the sender can inject malware into your system by sending infected forwarded files via email
 haalanki aise maamle pehle bhi hote rahe hai, lekin aam taur par log verde file ko bharose ke saath open karte hai
 a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the drawback and said that it would be fixed through a monthly security patch
 iske duusare din company ne nae apadet ke saath ise fiks karne kaa daawa kiya he

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who broke millions of heart-rending childhood friend Sakshi Rawat, will not go on a honeymoon after his much-talked-about wedding, but to give a litmus test in Sri Lanka where the Indian cricket team has not won a Test series for the past 17 years
 saat july 1981 ko janme dhoni ne apane 29wein janmdin se teen din pehle dehradun main sakshi ke saath pahari reeti rivaaj se shaadi kii lekin abhi vah apni jeevansangini ke saath chhuttiyaan nahin bitaa paaenge kyonki unki aguwai main bhartiya team jald hi srilanka daure par jaaegi jahaan use 18 july se teen test maichon kii shrinkhalaa main bhaag lenaa he
 It will be a tough challenge for Dhoni, who led India to several historic victories under his captaincy as the Indian team has not won a Test series on Sri Lankan soil since 1993, while in the meantime, they had to face defeat in two of the last three series
 dhoni kii hi aguwai main bharat ne pichley maheene srilanka ko uski sarajameen par parajeet karke 15 saal baad asia cap jeeta tha
 This is the sixth tour of Sri Lanka by the Indian team but Dhoni will go to this neighboring country for the first time to play the Test series
 bharat jab 2008 main teen match kii shrinkhalaa khilne ke liye srilanka daure par gaya to dhoni ne tab vishram le liya tha
 When Mohammad Azharuddin went to Sri Lanka with the team in 1995, India won the second Test in Colombo from July 27 to August 1 by 235 runs and won the three-match series 1-0
 yah vahi match tha jisamen sachin tendulkar ne duusari pari main naabad 104 ran banaaye jabaki unke baalasakhaa vinod kambli ne pehali pari main 125 ran kii pari kheli thi
 The Indian team did win two Test matches in Sri Lanka after that, but could never win the series
 bharat jab 1997 main srilankai daure par gaya to donon test match kaa parinaam nahin niklaa jabaki 2001 ke daure main use teen match kii shrinkhalaa main 1-2 se haar jhelni padi
 Seven years later, the result of the 2008 series remained the same
 tab ajanta mendis ne bhartiya ballebaajon ko apni rahasyamayi gendon ke jaal main uljhaakar apni team ko 2-1 se jeet dilaayi thi
 Now everyone is expecting charisma from Dhoni, who is going to play a Test match for the first time in Sri Lanka
 vaise srilankai sarajameen unke liye nayi nahin hai
 He has played 23 odis so far in Sri Lanka with 50 in 22 innings
 18 ke shandaar ausat se 803 ran banaaye hai
 It also includes seven half-centuries

 He said that this is worldliness, but four people together cannot stop the development of a state
 gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri kii sabha ko lekar barmer main suraksha ke chaak chauband intjaam kiye gaye the

 In a lecture on the role of youth in denying extremism, General Bajwa said that the army will defeat the terrorists but it needs the country's cooperation in eradicating extremism from the society
 unhone kaha, ki sena aatankwaadiyon se ladati he
 The fight against extremism and terrorism is fought by law enforcement agencies and society

 The campaign was launched against the elimination of extremism, before the Pakistani army launched the new campaign cancellation-ul-fassad for the elimination of extremism from the country
 radd-ul-fasaad naam se hi paak sena ke abhiyaan kaa maqasad nazar aa jaataa he
 Cancellation means removal, and fussad means quarrel or violence
 matlab hinsa ko khatm karnaa
 This was the first campaign against extremism

 It is only a year after Nitish Kumar's return to the ruling coalition in the assembly elections, but political seats are already being laid
 soobe kii satta par kabiz nitish kumaar ke chehre ko 2020 ke liye abhi se jediu ne project karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In such a situation, voices are being raised against Nitish from the ally BJP, then RJD is again inviting him to return to the Grand Alliance
 endie kii teesri sahyogi algepi khulkar nitish kumaar ke saath khadi najar aa rahi he
 BJP leader Sanjay Paswan stood against the branding of Nitish Kumar in Bihar and said that BJP has given JDU and Nitish Kumar an opportunity to stay in power for 15 years
 isliye ab vah bijepi ko bhi yah mauka den
 Not only this, Sanjay Paswan said that now Bihar needs the Modi model, not the Nitish model
 paswan ke bayaan ke baad jediu se bigadate rishte ko dekhte hue bijepi netaa or bihar ke dipti siem susheel modi ko aage aana padaa
 He had tweeted and said that Nitish Kumar is the captain of NDA in Bihar and will contest the assembly elections next year under his captaincy
 endie main netritv ko lekar koi sankat nahin he
 Even though Sushil Modi is trying to control the damage, it is true that a large section of the BJP believes that the right time has come for the rise of the party in Bihar
 bijepi netaaon ko lagata he ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 23 fisadi vot mili the or sabase zyada siten bhi
 In such a situation, the chances of the party becoming in power are strong
 bijepi netaaon ke utsaah kaa ek or bada kaaran lalu kii sthiti kaa kamjor hona bhi he or yadav matadaataaon ko saadhane main bijepi lagaataar juty hui he
 Realizing this, Sushil Modi deleted his tweet written in favor of Nitish within 15 minutes
 bihar main apane siyaasi tah naapane ke liye nitish kumaar kii jediu or bijepi ek duusare ke khilaaf khadey hone kii jor aajamaaish lagaataar kar rahe hai
 That is why efforts are constantly being made from both sides
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main alag-alag ladakar bijepi or nitish kumaar donon ek duusare ke raajnneetik takat se waakif ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, BJP and JDU understand this very well that in Bihar both are each other's helplessness and necessary
 argedy netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ne mana ki bijepi ko haraane ke liye mahagathabandhan main nitish kumaar waapas aaen to unka swaagat he
 Earlier, senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari had invited Nitish Kumar and said that Nitish Kumar should come to the grand alliance and he is the Prime Minister material
 aise main nishchit rup se nitish kumaar ke liye susheel modi or ramvilas paswan se zyada raghuvansh prasad singh kaa bayaan myne rakhata hai
 Actually, when Nitish Kumar was the leader of the Grand Alliance earlier, Raghuvansh Prasad did not refrain from criticizing everything then
 mana jaataa tha swar bhale hi unke hote the or soch uske peeche argedy supremeo lalu yadav kii hoti thi
 In such a situation, now there is the same meaning of speaking of Shivanand and Raghuvansh that they are not speaking without consent of Lalu Yadav
 varisht patrkaar himanshu mishra ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se lalu yadav ko apane bete tejasvi yadav ke maujuuda raajnneetik paristhiti main kshamta or kaabiliyat par bharosa nahin rah gaya he
 Although 80% of the rjd's vote bank is anti-bjp, after the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is trying to bring the Yadav vote in its favor
 jabaki muslim voton par nitish kumaar kii najar he
 But in spite of this, Nitish Kumar and BJP are not going to leave the party for the time being, because RJD can emerge as a big force after their separation

 team india ko apane pehle hi match main jis karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa usase cricket phans hataash hai
 South Africa beat India by 141 runs with great ease
 3 maichon kii vanade siries ke pehle match main na team india ke gendbaaj chale na hi dhurandhar ballebaaj
 The experienced all-rounder, Yuvraj, became clean bowled like a novice
 team india kaa koi bhi ballebaaj dakshin africa tej gendbaajon ke saamne tik nahin paaya
 Captain Dhoni alone kept trying to save the honor of the team
 bharat se ravaanaa hote hue to captain kool ne jeet kii hunkaar bhari thi, lekin dakshin africa pahunchate hi unke haav-bhav hi badal gaye
 Dhoni was also sweated by South Africa's sharp wickets and made a statement before the match that it would be a big challenge for his Youngistan team to keep pace with the pace and bounce on the South African tour
 dakshin africa ke captain di velliars ne bharat kii kamajori ko pehle se hi tad rakhaa tha or unhone ek-do nahin puure chah pesars utaar die jo ek ke baad ek tufaani gende phenkate rahe
 His balls used to get up and swing in the air
 bhartiya ballebaajon ne apana mind jaraa bhi applai nahin kiya or gendon kii teji kaa shikaar ho gaye
 Shikhar Dhawan could not detect Morkel's fast ball
 unhone hook karnaa chaha or balle kaa top age laga baithe
 Shikhar Dhawan even missed a great chance to run out Amla
 bechaare rohit sharma to 16 gendon tak to ran banane kii sthiti main hi nahin the
 He was just handling the ball somehow
 43 gendon main unhone mahaj 18 ran banaae or ek aisa ran churaane kii koshish kii jo tha hi nahin
 Consequently, he was run out
 unhone bhi ek kaich choda tha
 Yuvraj Singh was dismissed like a clumsy person
 unhen maclaren ne pehle to jabardast bounsar se swaagat kiya jo unke chehre ke paas lagi or duusari gend viketon par daali, gend thodaa sa ghumi or vah khadey ke khadey rah gaye
 Such a veteran player made such a mistake which was surprising
 sach to yah he ki yah siries yuvaraj ke liye astitv kii ladaai kii siries sabit hogi
 There was a lot of hope from Virat Kohli, when he missed his catch, he thought that now he will score a lot of runs, but a very easy catch on a rising ball kept Jack Kallis out
 unhone 35 gendon main 31 ran banaae or jab lag rahaa tha ki vah set kar rahe hai to maclaren kii gend par anirnay kii sthiti main kaich pakadaa baithe
 After the first four wickets fell for just 65 runs, it was decided that India could not match the score with Il Pahar
 dhoni ne hameshaa kii tarah ek captain kii pari kheli or 65 ran banaae jisamen bharat kii ore se iklauta chakka bhi tha
 He was dismissed in the 41st over
 tab tak jadeja, aswin or bhubaneshwar pavilion ja chuke the
 The team of the world's finest batsmen was dismissed in just 41 overs
 kahin se koi pratirodh nahin dikhaa
 But bowling first on this pitch, the Indians looked absolutely ordinary
 spinneron ne to bahut niraash kiya
 Ashwin and Jadeja were bowling exactly at club level
 kabhi ve short genden karte to kabhi phul toss
 His bowling was disappointing
 gend turn to le hi nahin rahi thi or unhone dimag bhi nahin lagaaya
 The result resulted in 85 runs in the last 7 overs which removed the match from India's hands
 hamaare tej gendbaaj vahaan 130 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se genden phenk rahe the
 He bowled short balls at a pace that should not have been done at all
 jaahir he pitayee to honi hi thi
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohit were bowling like the league players
 mohit sharma ne to 10 overon main 82 ran de die or vah bhi bina wicket liye
 Muhammad Shami was the only bowler to bowl 3 for 68 while bowling well
 is match se bharatiyon ne kuch sabak to siikhaa hi hoga
 Now how much improvement they can find in their match and how much they can improve in Durban, it has to be seen

 How will the army modernize in such a situation? up sena pramukh ne cameti ke saamne kaha is saal ke bajet main jo badhotaree kii gai he vah bahut hi nammaatr he or usase sena ko maayusi hui he
 This increase also does not meet the shortfall in inflation and taxes
 na sirf sena balki nausena ne bhi capital bajet ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 In its power point presentation in front of the parliamentary committee, the Navy said that due to the budget shortfall, there will be difficulty in completing the new plans and existing deals of the Navy
 isse nausena ke infrastracchar project ke saath hi aadhunikeekaran yojana bhi dhakka lagegaa
 In such a situation, the Standing Committee on Defense has asked the Ministry of Defense to make necessary enhancements in the budget provisions so that the three forces are able to work to their full potential and can meet their operational needs
 cameti ne yah bhi kaha ki haal main senaaon ke stesan or beson par aatanki hamale ko dekhte hue bajet main military beson kii suraksha ke liye alag se bajet praavdhaan kiya jaae
 The Defense Ministry in its reply before the committee said that it has already increased the financial capacity of the Deputy Chiefs of the three Services to 14,097 crore
 is bajet main is mad main alag se koi praavdhaan na kiye jane kii vajah se jaruri kharid or suraksha sambandhi intjaamon ke liye ab kharch main katautee kerani padegi

 Indian batsman Virat Kohli, who scored a century against Australia on Thursday, lashed out at the Australian players for constantly chastising them and not honoring Indian cricketers to the local audience
 kohli ne kaha, ‘ve (australian khilaadi) jab hataash ho jate hai tab chhintakashi karte hai
 There was definitely a warm atmosphere (at the crease) there
 ve lagaataar khilaadiyon par chhintakashi kar rahe the taaki ve dhyaan bhang kar saken
 Kohli played an innings of 116 runs to help India score 272 runs in the first innings on the third day of the fourth and final Test
 unhone kaha, ‘meri or riddhimaan saaha ke bich saajhedaari ke dauraan ve kaaphi zyada chhintakashi kar rahe the
 There was a moment on the field when Kohli got into a literal battle with Australian Ben Hilfenhaus, after which he survived a run-out
 unhone kaha, ‘hilphenhas ne mujhase kuch kaha jo bilkul hi gairajaruri tha
 Don't know where he came from even though he was not bowling
 main 99 ran par ran out hone se bachaa
 He told me some words that i cannot say in the press conference
 ’ Kohli told reporters, 'I also told him that you have nothing to do with it, so why are you doing this
 ’ kohli ne jo kuch kiya, unhen iskaa bilkul bhi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 He said, 'both Ishant and i started speaking back and got overwhelmed which caused a lot of flare up
 main aamtaur par aise hi cricket kheltaa hum
 i am happy with everything i did
 ’ riki ponting ko bich bachaav ke liye aana padaa or kohli ko is purv australian captain ne khinchakar is bahes se dur kiya jisase halaat thode shant ho gaye
 Kohli said, 'ponting told me that i don't answer him or else i would have trouble in vain
 usne sachmuch meri madad kii
 'ed Cowan and David Warner said angrily at Kohli and Ishant in Perth, but today they did not say anything to this young batsman
 unhone kaha, ‘usne mujhe badhai di
 Both of them did the same
 donon ne kuch nahin kaha
 In Sydney, he was behind me because i was not scoring and here i scored a century
 ’ sidney main duusare test ke dauraan kohli ne darshakon ko madhyam ungali dikhaayi thi jiske liye un par match fees kaa 50 pratishat jurmaana laga tha
 Kohli said, 'you have to answer literally
 aisa karke shatak jadna behatar he
 We do not go to hear any kind of talk from someone (audience) on the field
 ham antarrashtriya cricketer hai
 We did not come just for participation in it
 unhen yah baat janani hogi or hamen unhen bolkar or apane pradarshan se yah baat bataani hogi
 Comments unhone kaha, ‘yah kabhi kabhaar kaaphi niraashajanak ho jaataa he

 This is not good behavior towards players
 ’ Kohli said, "if the player says something, then he is fined and banned

 It should be in a proper way

 ’ kohli ne 116 ran kii pari khel kar bharat ko chauthe or antim test ke tisare din pehali pari main 272 ran banane main madad kii
 He said, 'during the partnership between Mary and Wriddhiman Saha, they were doing a lot of splattering
 ’ maidan par ek aisa bhi kshan aayaa jab kohli australian ben hilphenhas ke saath shabdic jang main ulajh gayi the, iske baad vah ran out se bache
 He said, 'hilfenhaus told me something which was absolutely unnecessary

 He said, 'he congratulated me
 donon ne aisa hi kiya
 Both did not say anything
 sidney main ve mere peeche pade hue the kyonki main ran nahin bana rahaa tha or yahaan maine shatak bana liya
 During the second Test in Sydney, Kohli showed the middle finger to the audience for which he was fined 50 per cent of the match fees
 kohli ne kaha, ‘aapako shabdic rup se jawaab dena hota he
 It is better to score a century by doing so
 ham maidan par kisi :darshakon: se kisi tarah kii baat sunne nahin jate
 We are international cricketers
 ham isamen sirf bhagidaari ke liye nahin aaye
 They have to know this and we have to tell them this by speaking and by their performance

 agar ve cricket kaa lutf uthaane aaye hai to unhen aisa karnaa chahie
 Neither should the players be abused by drinking alcohol

 Uncle, both accused of the victim, is not married
 donon vahiin peedita ke mata-pita ke kheton main bane ek ghar main rahete hai
 The girl alleges that the two would call her home and raped her in turn and threatened not to tell anyone
 yahi nahin, donon peedita par najar banaae rakhte ki vah police stesan pahunchakar shikaayat na kar de
 Ever since he brought the victim from her husband's house, he was imprisoned in his house
 use uske mata-pita or bhai se bhi nahin milane dete the
 When the accused came to know that she was pregnant, she got her secretly delivered to a hospital outside the city
 20 din pehle vah mehsana ke kadi aspataal main bhartee thi
 Shortly after delivery, the accused took the child in a bag and buried it in the fields of Sanand
 is bare main peedita ke bhai ko pataa chalaa or vah mehsana pahunchaa
 He called the Ahmadabad police and explained the whole thing
 viramgam police ne aaropee bade bhai ko giraftaar kar liya he or chota bhai faraar he
 The police also took the accused to Sanand's farm where he had buried the child

 But the real reason for the reconciliation was the pressure of the 135 mlas who won on the AIADMK ticket in the 234-member assembly to remain in government for the remaining four years

 All the 45 accused have been convicted by Special CBI Judge Pravas Kumar Singh
 sajaa kaa elaan video conferencing ke jariye teen oktober ko kiya jayega
 On the other hand, Lalu's son Tejaswi said, 'this is a conspiracy against our leader
 ham faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt main apil karenge
 Will answer opponents in the election, will go to public court
 faisle ke turant baad lalu ko court main hi hiraasat main le liya gaya
 He has been taken to Birsa Munda Jail
 jab ve court se baahar nikle to lalu ke saath unka betaa tejasvi bhi tha or ve chaaron ore se apane samarthakon se ghire hue the
 Despite the orders of Judge Prabhash Kumar Singh, his supporters shouted slogans

 His conviction has also been withdrawn after being convicted

 Lalu will be sentenced only through video conferencing
 jaise hi unhen sajaa milegi, tabhi unki sansad sadsyta khatm ho jaaegi
 Lalu's political journey has come to an end with this decision
 kyonki ab vah chunaav nahin lard paaenge

 Lalu is still very important in the power equation and vote bank politics
 bhale hi bihar kii kursi unase chhin gai ho par vot pratishat kii baat karen to lagata he ki ab bhi wo janata kii pasand hai
 Obviously, if Lalu is convicted in the fodder scam case, it will be like getting laddus in sitting hands for the opponents, especially for Nitish Kumar
 pichley dinon jis tarah se bijepi or jediu kaa gathbandhan tutaa he, saaf ho gaya he ki lalu ko to iskaa phayda milegaa hi
 In this case, the decision of the fodder scam can also affect the politics of Lalu's vote bank
 virdohi bhrashtachar kaa mudda uthaaenge or lalu jail main rahakar uskaa jawaab bhi nahin de paaenge
 The BJP has just given a stir and has also thrown mud on the Congress on the pretext of an ordinance protecting tainted leaders
 badi baat to ye he ki aaj ke faisle ke baad bhale hi lalu raajnneeti naa kar paaen lekin unhen lekar raajnneeti phir bhi chalati rahegi

 In the card, Indira Gandhi herself sent an invitation to Rajneesh Pandey's grandfather Krishna Kumar Pandey with his blue pen
 lekin vakt-vakt kii baat he
 Decades later, the same Krishna Kumar's grandson is reiterating the same relationship with his family, but the invitation was still not fated

 Parsekar, who was Health Minister in the Parrikar government, said, 'I lost the Mandrem seat badly in 1988
 meraa puraa parivaar emjeepi ke prati samarpit tha

 chunaav aachaar samhita ke dauraan pradhanmantri modi kii tasviir ko lekar chunaav ko ayog ke paas lagaataar shikaayatein pahunch rahi hai
 Based on this, the Election Commission has sent a second notice to the Ministry of Aviation seeking answers as to why the picture of PM Narendra Modi was used on boarding pass at Madurai Airport
 ayog ne mantralay se is sambandh main shanivaar ko hi jawaab daakhil karne ke liye kaha he
 On the other hand, notice has also been sent to the Railway Ministry regarding the watchman slogan on the tea cup in the train
 darasal, air india ke boarding paas par wibrant gujarat 2019 kaa prachaar kiya gaya tha, or iske saath pradhanmantri narendra modi or gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay rupani kii photo lagi thi
 After the announcement of the election dates on March 10, when the issue was disputed, last week (25 March) Air India directed to remove these pictures from the boarding pass
 baavjood iske shuukravaar ko madurai airport par air india ke boarding paas par modi-rupani vaali wibrant gujarat kii tasviir hone kii shikaayat saamne ai, jiske baad chunaav ayog ne vimaanan mantralay ko notice bhejkar jawaab maanga he
 However, before this, Air India has stated in its clarification that instructions were issued to remove the advertisement of Vibrant Gujarat from the boarding pass itself on 25 March, but the incident which has come to the fore now appears to be a human mistake
 ek baar phir sabhi airports ko vigyaapan hataane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 Now the Ministry of Aviation has to reply to the Election Commission in this regard
 duusari taraf shatabdi train main main bhi chaukeedaar chunavi abhiyaan vaale chaay cap ko lekar bhi chunaav ayog ne notice jari kiya he
 In the Kathgodam Shatabdi Express, passengers were given tea in a cup with the 'main Bhi Chowkidar', which a person complained about
 iske baad railway ne cap ko waapas le liya
 Now the Election Commission has asked the Railway Ministry to file an answer today regarding the viral picture
 bataa den ki trainon main chaay cap par 'main bhi chaukeedaar' chape hone ko lekar vivaad hone par railway ne shuukravaar ko safai di thi ki anumati liye bina hi kapon par isaki chapai kii gai thi
 Railways said that such cups have been returned and a penalty of Rs 1 lakh has been imposed on the vendor
 ab yah maamla chunaav ayog pahunch gaya he

 prakaash parv ke behatar aayojan ko lekar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii jamkar prashansa ho rahi he
 From common pilgrim to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, he has been praised, but RJD National Vice President Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who is part of his alliance, is not happy with it
 unka maananaa he kiprakash parv ke is safal aayojanaka shrey akele nitish kumaar ko dena thik nahin, balki soobe main sattarudh mahagathbandhan sarkaar ko diya janaa chahie
 Raghuvansh Prasad Yun always makes statements against Nitish Kumar, but this time on the stage he was distracted by his national president Lalu Prasad Yadav not getting a place
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar gathbandhan kii upeksha kar rahe hai or isse logon main naaraazgi he
 The senior RJD leader said that Bihar has a government of Mahagathbandhan, the system is of Mahagathbandhan government, why is credit being given to Nitish Kumar only
 prakaash parv ke mukhya samarohake dauraan manch parapradhanmantri narendra modi, bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal or bihar ke rajyapal ke alaava do kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan or ravishankar prasad bhi maujuud the
 At the same time RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav accompanied his two sons, Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi and Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav, but did not get a place on the stage
 lalu samaaroh main viipi ke liye baithne kii jagah hi darshak kii tarah baithe rahe
 Along with some ministers from Bihar, Shatrughn Sinha, who was from Patna Sahib, Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur were also sitting with her
 yahaan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apane sambodhan main argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav kaa naam liya, lekin pradhanmantri ne unka naam bhi nahin liya
 There is no mention of Shatrughan Sinha, while he is a Member of Parliament of Patna Sahib and this grand event was being held in his parliamentary constituency
 aise main purv kendriya gramin vikaas mantri raghuvansh prasad singh ko mauka mila gaya or unhone nitish kumaar par apni bhadaas nikaal lee
 Actually, the protocol is fixed for who will sit on the stage and arrangements were made under the same rules
 lekin isse bhadke raghuvansh prasad singh ne yahaan tak kah diya ki nitish kumaar ne notebandi kaa samarthan kiya, isliye pradhanmantri ne sharabbandi kaa samarthan kiya he
 Although Raghuvansh Babu also said in the end that it was not liked by the common people to sit down Lalu Prasad Yadav, but what happens is that he resides in the hearts of crores of people

 He said, "if the pitch is flat and dry like this, then there is a good chance for India
 pich hari bhari hone par england ke tej gendbaaj haaavee rahenge

 dilli kii satta main aane ke baad se aam aadmi party ko acchhee khabaren hi zyada milin
 But on Wednesday, many bitter sips of politics had to drink them together
 ek saal puraani party ke liye yah behad bura din rahaa
 The morning started due to the rebellion of Vinod Kumar Binny, MLA from Laxminagar
 dopaher dhalate-dhalate naubat kejariwal ko 'jhootha' kahe jane tak ja pahunchi
 Then in Amethi and in Uttarakhand, party leaders faced opposition
 party damege control ke upaay soch hi rahi thi ki epadiai ke mudde par party ke bheetar hi virodh paidaa ho gaya
 Whatever happened on Wednesday did not end on Wednesday
 yahaan se paidaa hue gatirodh party or sarkaar ke liye aage bhi gale kii haddi sabit ho sakate hai
 Then Binny's press conference is still pending
 binni ne phir daalaa adnga, kal karenge press conferencekabhi mantri pad na milane ko lekar naaraaz bataae jane vaale laksminagar se AAP vidhayak vinod kumaar binni ne ek baar phir party netritv ke khilaaf baghawat kar di
 She alleged that there has been a difference in the utterances of the party and now she has deviated from the issues on which she got power
 unhone is sambandh main buudhvaar ko press conference karke kuch raaj kholane kaa daawa kiya
 When Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was asked about this, for the first time, he described Binny as ambitious and said, 'binny wanted a ministerial post last time, now he wants a Lok Sabha ticket
 'kejariwal ke is bayaan se binni buree tarah aahat ho gaye
 Said, 'if Kejriwal has said so, it is a disgusting statement
 ' loksabhaa tikat chaahane kii baat ko nakaarte hue unhone kejariwal ko 'jhootha' tak bataa daalaa
 However, according to sources, Binny wanted a Lok Sabha ticket from East Delhi
 jabaki philhal is daud main haal hi main party main shaamil hue purv tivi patrkaar ashutosh aage hai
 It is reported that Binny is bitten by this
 tikat pehle se tay, phir kyon bharva rahe form: tina sharmaparty kii duusari baghawat kii BJP chhodkar AAP main ain tina sharma ne
 He accused his own party of working for power
 haalanki unhone khule taur par tikat bantwaare par sawaal uthaae
 He said that the party has already finalized the names of the candidates for the five Lok Sabha seats of Delhi and the process of filling the form for the ticket is a mere show-off
 tina sharma ne kaha, 'dilli main paanch loksabhaa siton ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam tay ho chuke hai
 The party will get tickets to Shazia Ilmi, Ashutosh Kumar, Gopal Rai, Dilip Pandey and Ashish Talwar
 'unhone aarope lagaaya ki party ne ab tak 2013 ke ghoshnaptr par koi kaam nahin kiya, uskaa dhyaan sirf 2014 loksabhaa chunaav par he
 'egg in Amethi, Kursiyambudhwar in Rishikesh was once again egged on Kumar Vishwas in Amethi
 phir rishikesh main press conference ke dauraan AAP netaa ashutosh or sanjay singh ko baari virodh jhelana padana
 The chairs started moving during the press conference, after which the two had to leave the middle
 isse pehle party ke kaaryakarta manch par baithne ko lekar aapas main hi bhid gaye the
 How to decide on the road, said the teacher had gathered outside Kejriwal Delhi Secretariat for their demands
 siem kejariwal jaise hi baahar nikle unhen pradarshnakariyon ne gher liya or jawaab maangane lage
 Kejriwal said, 'how should i decide on the road
 abhi to meri meetings hai
 Come to meet 4-5 of you tomorrow
 ' kabhi sadak par sangharsh ke jariye hi apni sari raajnneetik takat batorne vaale kejariwal ke is bayaan ne thodaa chaunkaaya
 He also raised a question whether Kejriwal and his party have changed after gaining power
 yogendra kii press conference main bhi hangaamaharyana main party kii jameen taiyaar karne main lage AAP netaa yogendra yadav ko bhi virodh jhelana padaa
 There was a lot of uproar in his press conference in Kurukshetra
 khud ko jat sabha kaa pradhan bataane vaala ek shaks yogendra ko baahar jane ke liye kehane laga, jiske baad hangaamaa shuru ho gaya
 Differences within the party on FDI: The Aam Aadmi Party must have been waiting for the day to end that another political bomb exploded on it
 haal hi main party se judane vaale captain gopinath ne epadiai ke mudde par dilli sarkaar ke faisle kaa virodh kar diya
 The Sheila government's decision to approve FDI in retail has recently been overturned by the Kejriwal government
 captain gopinath kaa kahana he ki isse niveshkon main galat sandesh gaya he isliye party ko apana faisla waapas lenaa chahie
 He also advised the party not to take decisions in haste

 watson ko 31 ke kul yoga par ishanth sharma ne out kiya lekin iske baad rahane or binni ne shandaar saajhedaari karte hue team ko jeet kii sthiti main laane kaa kaam kiya
 Rahane, however, was caught by Aaron Mishra off Amit Mishra for a total of 108 runs but by then the Rajasthan Royals were in a winning position
 rahane ne apni 53 gendon kii sanyambhari pari main chah chauke lagaae
 Mishra probably did not approve of Rajasthan Royals winning
 unhone apane chauthe or pari ke 18wein over main rahane ke saath-saath bread hoj (1) ko out kar sunrisers ko do bade jatke die
 Binny, however, hit the fifth ball of this over and then took two runs off the sixth ball, bringing his team closer to victory

 duusari gend par vah ek bhi ran nahin le sake or teesri gend par finch ke haathon lapak liye gaye
 In this way Stan reduced the weight of his team
 binni ne haalanki chauthi gend ko seemaa rekha ke baahar bhejkar apni team ko 125 ranon tak pahunchaaya
 Now the Rajasthan Royals needed nine runs off eight balls
 paanchavin gend par ek bhi ran nahin bana or chhathi gend par binni ne ek ran lekar strike apane paas rakhi
 In the final over, Rajasthan Royals needed eight runs to win
 binni ne bhubaneshwar kii pehali gend par ek ran liya or strike apane nae saathi james folownar (naabad 8) ko diya
 He hit the second and third balls of Bhubaneswar to give his team the victory with three balls remaining
 falconar ne do gendon par do chauke lagaae
 Earlier, winning the toss, Rajasthan Royals invited the Sunrisers to bat first and restricted them to 133 for six in their allotted 20 overs on the basis of their bowlers' disciplined performance
 sunrisers ke liye captain shikhar dhawan ne sabase adhik 38 ran banaae jabaki david warner ne 32 or lokesh rahul ne 20 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 Warner and Dhawan shared a 75-run partnership for the second wicket, but the partnership was a result of 69 balls, which proved to be a disadvantage for the team, aiming to create a big total
 sunrisers ne do ran ke kul yoga par aron finch (2) kaa wicket ganvaa diya tha
 After this, Dhawan, who hit three fours and a six off 34 balls, and Warner, who hit a four off 35 balls, handled the innings
 ye donon haalanki khulkar shot nahin khel sake, jiskaa nateeja hua ki sunrisers kaa ran rate 6 ranon se kareeb hi rah gaya
