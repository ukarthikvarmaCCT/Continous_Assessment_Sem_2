 kuldeep-chahal lagaataar do tii-20 siries main nahin chune gaechahar- sundar jaise khilaadiyon ko aajamaa rahe hai kohlikuladeep yadav or yujavendra chahal ko bhale hi maujuuda satr main tii-20 cricket main rashtriya team ke saath mauka nahin mila ho, lekin visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki agle saal hone vaale vishwa cap se purv khel ke sabase chote praaroop main inhen chukaa hua maananaa jaldbaaji hogi
 Kuldeep and Chahal, who have been confirmed in the limited-overs squad for the past 24 months, have not been included in the Indian team for two consecutive T20 series, including the current home series against South Africa
 dharmashala main pehle tii-20 se purv bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne kaha tha ki ve rahul chaahar or washington sundar jaise khilaadiyon kaa aajamaa rahe hai, kyonki ve ballebaaji main adhik gaharaai or lagaataar 200 se adhik kaa score bananaa chaahate hai
 Former India opener Akash Chopra said in the context of the decision to keep Kuldeep and Chahal out, 'the idea behind this is that if there is depth in the batting then you can bat in a certain way
 lekin is tarah kii gaharaai ke saath aap paaramparik tareeke se nahin khel sakate
 England did the same
 unhone ballebaaji main gaharaai par dhyaan kendrit kiya kyonki ve 400 ran (vanade antarrashtriya maichon main) bananaa chaahate the or unhone kai baar ise hasil kiya
 Akash Chopra said, "it seems that India wants to adopt a similar aggressive attitude in T20 and there is nothing wrong in that
" ab unhen lagaataar 220 ran banane kii ichhashakti dikhaani hogi
 "chopra said," Batting at number eight, ninth and 10th is quite ambitious (because you probably don't need it in the 20-over match), but if you're trying to score 220, that's fine
 ’chopra kaa maananaa he ki agar koi team wicket chatakaane kii apni kshamta ke saath samjhauta karnaa chaahati he to use adhik ran banane honge
 This former Indian opener believes that Chahal will make a comeback in T20 soon
 chahal philhal sirf vanade antarrashtriya team kaa hissaa hai, jabaki kuldeep 50 overon ke praaroop or test match donon tiimon main shaamil hai, lekin antim ekadash main unka khelnaa tay nahin he
 Chopra said, 'chahal will return
 rahul chaahar gendbaaj hai or aathven number par shaayad washington sundar kii ballebaaji kii jarurat hi na pade
 Former Indian spinner and now spin coach Sunil Joshi welcomed the move to try the youngsters, but cautioned that such a situation could create confusion in the minds of spinners
 joshi ne kaha, ‘main suzav duungaa ki kuldeep or chahal jab rashtriya team kaa hissaa nahin hon to gharelu cricket khelen
 There is no question of finger spinner or wrist spinner here
 yah ballebaajon ko chakaane kii ranneeti he
 "let's see how the young spinners do and they should be given enough chances, but at the same time if Chahal and Kuldeep play only one format then their rhythm may deteriorate
" safed gend kaa cricket puri tarah se lay par nirbhar he
 ' maharashtra or mumbai kiski he or kiski nahin, is par bayanon kaa bazaar lagaataar garmata ja rahaa he
 Now Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has jumped into the controversy saying that Mumbai belongs to everyone and everyone will live there
 'sushasan babu' ne kaha he ki mumbai kisi ek kii nahin he
 He said that Raj Thackeray's latest statement about North Indians is just an election stunt
 gauratlab he ki raaj thakare ke us bayaan par tikhi pratikriya hui thi, ki jisamen unhone marathi bhashi logon se apil ki thi ki ve paraprantiyon se sabji na khariden
 RJD has already termed this statement as 'country breaker'

 The arrest of journalist Prashant Kanaujia in the disputed post case has also been questioned by KC Tyagi, spokesperson of bjp's Janata Dal United
 kasee tyaagi kaa kahana he ki patrkaar ko giraftaar karnaa immergency ke kaale din kii yaad dilaataa he
 He further said that everyone has freedom of thought, freedom
 lekin uttar pradesh sarkaar ne jis dhang se patrkaar prashanth kanaujia ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha, vah asanvaidhanik tha
 Now the Supreme Court has ordered his release, this order is absolutely right
 is par uttar pradesh sarkaar ko maafee maangani chahie
 JDU spokesman KC Tyagi says that the attitude of police authorities is very objectionable
 ye apatkaal ke kaale dinon kii yaad dilaataa he
 Journalists or political activists were then arrested without giving any reason
 kasee tyaagi ne sawaal uthaae ki police kaise 11 din kii remand par kisi bhi patrkaar ko le sakati he, likhane kii aazaadee hamane bade sangharsh ke baad praapt kii he
 We have opposed the Emergency

 He further said that there is freedom in the country and abroad in the matter of commenting
 log bhagwaan par devi-devataaon par tippanee karte hai, unki taraf koi karrwai nahin hui
 Has the government become insensitive? Does the government find the criticism uncomfortable? KC Tyagi has demanded that i want the Uttar Pradesh government chief, Yogi ji, to tell the authorities that the journalists should apologize to the world
 noida athurity kaa maine ek bayaan dekha he jisamen unhone kaha he ki upar se hamako koi aadesh nahin tha
 The order may not have been received, but the government should apologize for this misdeed

 Just as liberalization became prevalent by displacing the license raj, reform was replaced by liberalization, in the same way the ease of doing business has become prevalent these days instead of reform
 vishwa bank 2004 se ez of duing bijness ke aadhaar par rekking kar rahaa he, lekin bhartiya raajnneeti main ise prachlit kiya he pradhanmantri narendra modi ne
 First made Gujarat the face of Ease of Doing Business, then it became the ideology of its governance

 Ranking has increased from 178 countries to 190 countries
 ez of duing bijness kaa matlab hota he ki bharat main ek company kholane main kitni kam dikkatein aati hai
 Earlier, only the report of India was made on the basis of the opinion of a professional firm in Mumbai, but now it includes Delhi
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat jaise vishaal desh kaa moolyankan sirf mumbai or dilli ke adhyayan se nahin kiya ja saktaa he, lekin china jaise vishaal desh ke liye bhi sirf do hi shahar adhyayan main shaamil kiye gaye hai - shanghai or beijing

 ' congress kii tippanee jetali ke is bayaan par ai he ki sansad main gatirodh ke liye congress party nahin, balki congress netritv jimmedaar he
 Accusing the finance minister of trying to create a rift between the Congress and its leadership, party leader Jairam Ramesh said that this was being done because Jaitley had 'completely lost control over the economic situation'
 ' ek samvaadadaata sammelan main unhone kaha, 'vitt mantri hone ke bajaae jetali naarad muni ho gaye hai
 He should stop becoming Narada Muni and become Finance Minister
 ' manyataon ke mutabik naarad muni puri duniya main bhraman karte the or ek jagah kii kahani duusari jagah le jate the, jisase tanaav paidaa hota tha
 The comments ramesh ne kaha ki congress party or iske netritv ke bich koi matbhed nahin he
 He said, 'the Finance Minister is creating the illusion that both the Congress leadership and the Congress are different
 ' unhone daawa kiya ki didisie ghotaale main gambhir aaropon kaa saamana karne ke baad vitt mantri 'vyagr or baichaiyn' hai
 He alleged, 'the Prime Minister is shamelessly engaged in personal public relations campaign and the Finance Minister is unable to handle the economy
 ' unhone kaha, 'vikaas nahin ho rahaa he, niryaat kam ho gaya he, mahangaai bad gai he, nivesh neeche aa gaya he, audyogic utpaadan bahut neeche chalaa gaya he or kachche tel kii keemton main record kami ke baavjood aisa ho rahaa he

 In a press conference, he said, "jaitley has become Narada Muni instead of being the Finance Minister
 unhen naarad muni bananaa band karnaa chahie or vitt mantri bananaa chahie
 According to beliefs, Narada Muni used to travel all over the world and take the story from one place to another, which caused tension
 tippaniyan Ramesh said that there is no difference between the Congress party and its leadership
 unhone kaha, 'vitt mantri bhram paidaa kar rahe hai ki congress netritv or congress donon alag-alag hai
 He claimed that the finance minister is 'anxious and restless' after facing serious allegations in the DDCA scam
 unhone aarope lagaae, 'pradhanmantri besharmi se vyaktigat jansampark abhiyaan main lage hai or vitt mantri arthvyavastha sambhaal nahin paa rahe hai
 "he is not developing, exports have come down, inflation has gone up, investment has come down, industrial production has gone down and this is happening despite a record reduction in crude oil prices," he said
 ' Ramesh's statement comes after Jaitley and some other ministers attacked the Congress's 'first Family' for a parliamentary deadlock two days ago at a newspaper's award ceremony
 jetali ne sanket die the ki mahatvapurn vidheyakon ko paarit karaane ke liye 'vaikalpik maarg' ko apanaaya jayega

 shivatandav stotra kaa pratidin paath karne se vyakti ko jis kisi bhi siddhi kii mahatvakanksha hoti he, bhagwaan shiv kii krupa se vah aasaani se purna ho jaati he
 Let us know how Shiva became a Tandava source - both Kubera and Ravana were the children of sage Vishrava and both were half-brothers
 rishi vishrava ne sone kii lanka kaa rajya kuber ko diya tha lekin kisi karanvash apane pita ke kehane par ve lanka kaa tyaag kar himachal chale gaye
 After Kuber left Dashaanan was very happy with this
 vah lanka kaa raja ban gaya or lanka kaa rajya praapt karte hi dhire-dhire vah itnaa ahamkaari ho gaya ki usne sadhujanon par anek prakaar ke atyaachaar karne shuru kar die
 When Kubera got the news of these atrocities of Dashainan, he sent an envoy to explain to his brother, who advised Dashainan to follow the true path as Kubera said
 kuber kii salaah sun dashanan ko itnaa krodh aayaa ki usne us doot ko bandi bana liya va krodh ke maare turant apni talwaar se uski hatya kar di
 Dushanan was so enraged by Kubra's advice that with the killing of the messenger, he took his army and went to conquer the city of Kuber, Alakapuri, and after destroying the city of Kuber, he killed his brother Kubera with a mace
 But somehow the generals of Kubera brought Kuber to Nandanvan
 chunki dashanan ne kuber kii nagari va uske puspak vimaan par bhi apana adhikaar kar liya tha, so ek din puspak vimaan main savaar hokar sharavan kii taraf chal padaa
 But passing through a mountain, the speed of his wreath plane itself slowed down
 chunki puspak vimaan kii ye visheshta thi ki vah chaalak kii icchaanusaar chalata tha tathaa uski gati man kii gati se bhi tej thi, isliye jab puspak vimaan kii gati mand ho gari to dashanan ko bada aashcharya hua
 Just then, his vision stood on Nandishwar with a huge and dark body
 nandishwar ne dashanan ko chetaya ki-yahan bhagwaan shankar krida main magn hai isliye tum laut jaao, lekin dashanan kuber par vijay paakar itnaa dambhi ho gaya tha ki vah kisi ki sunne tak ko taiyaar nahin tha
 He told him that - who is this Shankar and with what authority does he play here? i will erase the name of the mountain which has blocked the speed of my aircraft
 itnaa kehete hue usne parvat kii neenv par haath lagaakar use uthaanaa chaha
 Suddenly Lord Shankar got distracted by this disturbance and sat there with his toe and pressed the mountain so that it would become stable
 lekin bhagwaan shankar ke aisa karne se dashanan kii baahen us parvat ke neeche dab gai
 As a result, due to anger and tremendous suffering, Dasanan got into a fierce cry, which seemed as if the holocaust would occur
 tab dashanan ke mantriyon ne use shiv stuti karne kii salaah di taaki uskaa haath us parvat se mukt ho sake
 Dashaanan began to sing all the hymns of Shiva mentioned in the Samaveda without delay, which pleased Lord Shiva, forgiving Dashainan and freeing his arms

 Congress leader Digvijay Singh lashed out at Narendra Modi for criticizing the UPA government and challenged him to debate with any Congress leader on matters of governance and development
 modi ke kattar aalochak maane jane vaale digvijay ne modi ke vichaar ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki kya ek tendua apane dhabbe badal saktaa he
 Shortly after Modi addressed his overseas Indian supporters through a video conference, the All India Congress Committee general secretary opened his artillery to the bjp's prime ministerial candidate and dismissed the criticism of the government by Modi on the microblogging site While alleging that Modi gave 'false figures' of development during the time of NDA rule
 singh ne twit kiya, ‘sunakar acha laga ki modi samaveshi raajnneeti kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin kya koi tendua apane dhabbe badal saktaa he? feku modi puri ravaani main hai
 The NDA is giving false figures of the development of the regime
 ’ internet ke is madhyam ke jariye singh ne jaise matadaataaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘congress aapako takat detii he
 Modi gives himself strength
 pasand aapaki he
 Modi wants Congress free India and Congress wants hunger free India

 Digvijay was referring to the steps taken by two UPA governments in the meantime such as RTI, RTE, Food Security, MNREGA and similar schemes
 unhone kaha, ‘suchi or bhi bad sakati he
 If Modi has the strength, can he argue with any of us on governance, development and other national matters? Referring to the post-godhra riots in Gujarat, a corruption case in some bjp-ruled states and a cash-on-camera case involving a former BJP president, Singh mocked Modi's claim that people would be able to bring constructive change in the country
 Looking towards unhone sawaal kiya ki kya aisa isliye ho rahaa he ‘kyonki sampradayik dangon main hajaaron log maare gaye, kyonki apano ko phayda pahunchane ke liye niyamon ko todaa maroda gaya, kyonki bangaroo lakshmana camere par pakade gaye
 Digvijay's stance got a little sharper when he mentioned Modi praising Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 unhone likhaa, ‘modi kehete hai atalji ek svarnim yug the
 Is it because Modi did not follow Rajdharma? sansad par aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kiya?
 Terrorists released? '

 Ranbir: When was the most challenging phase for you? Amitabh: Ranbir is challenging every day

 Sometimes you ask yourself the question of what you can do best and what you can get back
 thodaa kaam kiijie, talmail bithie
 The corporation i started got a big failure in me, it bankrupted me
 mere paas paisa nahin tha, koi film nahin thi, karj dene vaale mere peeche pade the, yah bhayaavah anubhav tha

 What else can i say (laughter)? i remember meeting you in London, we were staying in the same hotel

 You said, "I need a little space for myself

 According to the information, Sasikala's husband was admitted to Gleneagles Health City in Perumbakkam, Chennai on September 10 after multiple organ failures
 jahaan isiu main unka ilaaj chal rahaa tha
 According to a medical bulletin issued by the hospital administration, Natarajan had been undergoing treatment for a chronic liver disease for the past six months
 kuch media reports main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki natarajan kii beemaari kaa ekmaatr ilaaj organ transplant hi tha or ve april se apane liye ek donor kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 a report by The News Minute mentions that doctors at Gleneagles Global Hospital prepared Natarajan for a double organ transplant late on Tuesday and surgery is underway
 ab sawaal uthta he ki unhen donor kahaan se mila? is sawaal kaa jawaad dete hue times of india kii ek report ne kaha he ki doctoron ne natarajan ke liye maiching donor thanjavur ke ek aspataal main bhartee gambhir rup se ghayal kishor ke taur par paaya jiske baad use chennai ke liye air lift karavaaya gaya
 Where is the issue? TOI stated in its report, "after the seriously injured boy was admitted to Thanjavur hospital and declared brainwashed, Tamil Nadu State Transplant Authority alerted all the hospitals about the potential donor Sent
 " lekin, 4 oktober ko hi TOI main andar ke pannon par chhapi ek khabar ke mutabik 'medical salaah par majdoor discharge, chennai bheja gaya'

 It is also important to mention here that the cost of an hour of an air ambulance is Rs 1 lakh, which is much higher for a daily wage laborer like Karthik
 gaur karne vaali ek baat or he ki har saal lagbhag 1
 5 lakh people need kidney, but only 3 thousand people get donor
 yani liver kaa intjaar kar rahe 25 hajaar marijon main se keval 800 bhaagyashaaleeyon ko hi yah naseeb ho paata he

 input bhashaa There was chaos in a drain in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, after getting banned notes of five hundred and thousand
 naale main note bahane kii khabar paakar log naale main koode pade
 Before the police could reach the spot, the people gathered the note and got upset
 police ne baaki bache noton ko apane kabje main le liya he
 The case is of Sarvodaya Nagar police station, Ghazipur
 jahaan shuukravaar kii subah us vakt afra tafari much gai, jabanalemen logon ne paanch sau or hajaar ke puraane note behate hue dekhe
 Before the police could get information, people jumped into the drain and started looting notes
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki lakhon kii sankhya main bah rahe noton ko badi sankhya main lut kar log maukey se faraar ho gaye
 After getting the information after quite a while, SP Durgesh Kumar himself reached the spot with the heavy police force and took the remaining notes in his possession
 jabaki usase pehle hi log kaaphi sarenotlekar vahaan se nikal chuke the
 However, police say the number of old notes was quite small
 police ab in noton ko lekar jaanch main jute gai he ki aakhir lakhon kii sankhya main ye note kisne naale main phenke the
 And who was this black money from? police ko abhi tak is maamle main koi suraag nahin mil paaya he
 If your luxury car is stolen, you go to the police station with a complaint, but if the policeman is involved in a gang of thieves? One such case has come up in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh
 estf team nen lagjri gadiyon ke choron ke ek aise giroh ko pakadaa he, jisamen shahar ke sahajanwaan thane kaa ek daroga bhi shaamil he
 stf's Gorakhpur unit arrested three people from a railway colony old police post on Saturday night and recovered three luxury cars
 isamen se ek gaadi dhokhadhadi kar hadpi gai thi, jabaki do anya gaadiyaan farji naam or pate se finance karakar bech di gai thim
 In this case, a case has been registered against five people including Sanjay Rai, SHO of Sahajanwan
 thanedaar par baraamad gadiyon main se ek kaa istemaal karne, dhamkee dene or dhokhadhadi main shaamil hone kaa aarope he
 The arrested accused have been identified as Manish Singh, resident of Gayatrinagar, Arunondra alias Chhotu Pandey, resident of Mirzapur and Sanket Vivek Suptankar, resident of Mumbai
 mumbai se dhokhadhadi or chori kar gorakhpur laai gai lagjri gadiyon ke bare main estf esaspi ko soochna mili thi
 On the instructions of STF SSP, CO VK Singh, in-charge of STF Gorakhpur, formed a team led by sub-inspectors Satya Prakash Singh and Rajiv Ranjan to recover these vehicles
 mubir se mili soochna ke aadhaar par is team ne teenon ko giraftaar kar unke kabje se do inova or ek scorpiyo baraamad kii
 Earlier in this case, Himalaya Complex in front of Juna Golden Nest, Dadar Road, Mumbai Dr
 surendra singh ne lakhanu main estf ke esaspi se milakar sahajanwaan thanedaar sanjay raay, gorakhpur ke manish raay, mumbai ke dayanand phoke, sanket supatankar or kethan pandya par apni inova gaadi dhokhadhadi kar hadapney kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Later Dr

 After the recovery of the vehicles and the arrest of the accused, the police have also added the section of fraud, forgery, seizure of recovered goods in this case, but the police refused to say anything about their crime police station, only 6 people a case has been filed but ended the matter
 yato bijepi kii sarkaar banegi yaa phir raashtrapati shashan rahegaa
 If neither of these two options is implemented, the Assembly will be dissolved
 '' pechidagiyon main uljhe uttarakhand ko lekar bijepi or centre kii narendra modi sarkaar kii ab yahi ranneeti he
 Disclosing that, the government and a senior BJP leader claim that the Congress' Harish Rawat government will not be re-established at any cost in the current assembly
 kisi tarah kii andruni gutbaji bijepi ke oparation lotus ko murjhaa na de, isliye kendriya netritv ne anushaasan kii lakshmana rekha khinchate hue mukhyamantri pad kaa mansuba paale sabhi varisht netaaon ko do-took kah diya he ki jise party main rahanaa he, usko alaakaman kaa nirnay maananaa hoga
 However, the dilemma of both the parties in the state regarding the arithmetic of power remains intact and both eyes are on the Nainital High Court
 congress kii ummid sirf 9 baagi vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd hone par tiki he or usne chunaav main jane kaa man bana liya he to duusari taraf bijepi ne centre main apni sarkaar ke prabhaav kii badaulat uttarakhand kii satta kaa mukammal gemplan taiyaar kar liya he
 The BJP has intensified the initiative to form a government because according to the constitutional obligation (seal of parliament within 60 days), Parliament's approval on President's rule by April 27 is necessary and it was passed due to opposition having majority in Rajya Sabha
 It is not possible for the Modi government to get it done
 isliye adaalat kii ore se jald rukh saaf nahin hua to centre sarkaar arunachal pradesh kii tarah hi nai sarkaar ke gathan kaa vikalp apana sakati he taaki do maheene baad hone vaale rajyasabha kii ek seat ke chunaav main fori phayda liya ja sake
 BJP national president Amit Shah himself will reach Uttarakhand on 14 April where he is to attend the annual Vaishakhi Festival organized by BJP leader and spiritual guru Satpal Maharaj at Premnagar ashram in Haridwar
 lekin vahaan ve party ke netaaon-kaaryakartaaon se bhi alag se milakar rajnatik halaat kaa jayja lenge
 What is the power strategy BJP believes that the High Court cannot stop the 9 rebel members of the Congress from voting in the Assembly because technically these mlas have not yet violated any whip
 party yah maanakar chal rahi he ki rajyapal kii ore se ab bijepi ko hi vaikalpik sarkaar ke gathan kaa nyauta milegaa or vidhansabha main 9 baagiyon kii badaulat vah 70 sadasyeey vidhansabha main aasaani se bahumat ke liye jaruri 36 kaa aankada (bijepi ke 27 or congress ke 9) hasil kar legi
 But if Harish Rawat gets a chance to get majority before the court, Rawat will not be able to achieve the magical figure due to the rebels
 aisi paristhiti main hi baagiyon par vip ulanghan kaa maamla banegaa, lekin unki sadsyta radd karne kaa faisla bhi vidhansabha spikar ko lenaa hoga
 The BJP claims that the BJP will get the chance to form the government after that and the speaker will do as he wishes, so the decision to cancel the membership of the rebels can be hung in the name of hearing till the election in the same way as in Uttar Pradesh Kesharinath Tripathi did it in the case of BSP mlas
 lekin bijepi kii duusari ranneeti in 9 baagiyon ke bina bhi he
 If the membership of 9 is rejected, then both BJP and Congress will have 27-27 mlas in the assembly as BJP has also petitioned to cancel the membership of one of its 28 mlas
 agar 10 vidhayakon kii sadsyta khatm hoti he to vidhansabha 60 sadasyeey ho jaaegi or bahumat ke liye sirf 31 vidhayakon kii zarurat hogi
 In such a situation, the Kingmaker will play the bsp's 2, ukd's 1 and 3 Independents (all 6 mlas together have a PDF name front)
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar is formule ke liye nirdaleey kheme ke vidhayakon se baatcheet shuru kar di he
 But according to BJP sources, in the current situation, all the mlas of PDF stand firmly in Harish Rawat's camp
 lekin bijepi ke ek varisht netaa daawa karte hai ki bispi ko chhodkar baaki chaar vidhayakon ne bharosa diya he ki agar rajyapal kii ore se party ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka mila to ve mantri pad kii shart ke saath vichaar karne ko taiyaar hai
 Three of these mlas are directly negotiating with two former chief ministers of the state
 in vidhayakon se sampark saadhane ke alaava bijepi kaa daawa he ki bispi ke 2 vidhayakon ko sadan se anupasthit rahane ke liye manaaya ja saktaa he
 These strategies of the BJP are also confirmed by the comment of Shyam Jaju, the in-charge of the Uttarakhand BJP and the National Vice President, Shyam Jaju, "we had demanded President's rule, it seemed our victory because the Congress is not in power there
" ab uttarakhand main do hi prakaar kii sthiti ho sakati he- raashtrapati raaj yaa phir hamaari sarkaar
 However, as the matter gets entangled in a legal battle, there is a delay in the BJP going ahead with its strategy
 jabaki yah mana ja rahaa tha ki mukhyamantri pad ko lekar andruni khinchataan main bijepi chunaav main jane kaa vikalp apana sakati he
 The name of the compulsion Kosariyari now wants the BJP high command to hold power in Uttarakhand so much that it has tapped the socio-regional equation along with showing the pole of discipline to senior leaders
 party ke is sameekaran main sabase kam samay (3 maheene 29 din) tak soobe ke mukhyamantri rahe 73 varshiya bhagat singh koshyari kii lottery khulti dikh rahi he
 Although the BJP is denying its role in the fall of Harish Rawat's government, the circumstances are not confirming its claim 
 duusari taraf rajnatik or kanoonee ghamaasan ke bich harish ravat ne jis tarah logon ke bich jaakar khud ko sar kataa mukhyamantri kahkar sahanubhuti batorne kaa abhiyaan chhedaa he, usase bhi party chintit he
 In such a situation, when BJP strategists reviewed the political situation, they realized that Rawat was getting sympathy
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai ki kumaun kshetra kii 29 vidhansabha siton par sahanubhuti kaa asar ho saktaa he
 According to the sources, therefore, as part of the party's strategy, the former Chief Minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari is looking to form a government under the leadership
 ravat or koshyari donon kumaun kshetra se aate hai or donon hi rajput samudaay ke hai
 The BJP believes that Rawat's sympathy can be prevented by making Koshyari the chief minister
 ravat kii tarah hi koshyari kii chhavi saadagi or sahaj sulabh netaa kii he or donon kaa jamini aadhaar ek jaisaa he
 Not only this, the 9 rebels of the Congress have also expressed their desire to make Koshyari the Chief Minister in front of the BJP General Secretary of Operation Lotus, Kailash Vijayvargiya
 koshyari ke paksh main yah bhi daleel di ja rahi he ki isse pehle bhi do baar unhen mukhyamantri banane se roka ja chukaa he isliye party kaaryakartaaon main bhi unako lekar sahanubhuti he
 Though Koshiyari is currently a Lok Sabha MP, the party's strategy is to take oath around April 27 to focus on development-oriented schemes by running the government for six months and dissolving the assembly and going to the polls soon
 yudhstar par chunavi vikaas kii bisaat uttarakhand main rajnatik asthirataa ke bich centre ne vikaas yojanaon ke liye khajaane kaa munh khol diya he
 In the very first fortnight of President's rule, the Center has 33 for flyover under construction of SPA ie Special Program Assistance
 34 karod ru
 And 26 for construction of a bridge in Garhwal, Srinagar
 91 karod ru
 And along with sanctioning money for polytechnic construction in Garsain also a hundred crores for the ongoing Ardh Kumbh in the state
 kii manjuuri di he
 For the first time, by sanctioning a total of 447 crores rupees, the Center has indicated the lack of money for construction works in the state, whereas till now the Congress ruling government had been making the issue of not releasing money for the development of the state at the Center
 ranneeti ke mutabik koshyari kii aguwai main bijepi package dekar pehle chah maah ke bheetar tamaam vikaas yojanaon ko amali jama pahanaakar yah sandesh dene kii koshish karegi ki bijepi pradesh ke vikaas ke liye krit sankalp he
 Apart from this, the BJP has also made a roadmap to take special projects worth counting in terms of elections in six months
 barfbaari main bhi chardhaam kii sadaken kharaab na hon, chardhaam ke liye railway line kaa kaam shuru karne, rajya ke sabhi railway fliover kaa kaam puraa karne, sabhi bipiel pariwaron ko centre kii pradhanmantri ujjwal yojana ke tahat gas conection dene, pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana ke tahat gaanv-gaanv main sadakon kaa jaal bichaane or parvatiy kshetra main 100 helleyped nirmaan kaa kaam tej karne jaisi kai yojanaon ko apane agenda main shaamil kiya he jise yudhstar par karne kii ranneeti he
 The BJP, which is determined to come to power on its own in the electoral mood in 2017, has been in multiplication of power for six months, while the Congress seeks sympathy from the very first day by trying to make itself look martyred by the fall of its government
 Is doing satta se bedakhal hote hi congress loktantr bachaao ke naare ke saath pehle un nau vidhansabha kshetron main padayatraaen kar rahi he jahaan se congress ke tikat par jite vidhayakon ne baagi hokar sarkaar ko asthir kar diya
 The Congress is going among the voters in these areas to expose the conspiracy to destabilize the state government by joining these rebels with the BJP
 lekin baagi bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke saath milakar is loktantr bachaao yatra kaa virodh kar kaale jhande dikhaakar yatra kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay says, "stopping us from saying our words is going to prove suicidal for the BJP, while the rebels are sure to clear the leaf from Uttarakhand
" ''jaahir he ki bihar or dilli main tamaam micromanagement or chunavi chanakyon ke baavjood patkhni kha chuki bijepi uttarakhand main koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati thi, isliye congress kii kalah ko hawa dekar usne ravat sarkaar kaa takhtapalat kar diya taaki ravat kii chhavi ko dhoomil kar apni chunavi jameen majboot kar sake

 hamane pehle hi apane pathakon ko jaankaree di thi ki congress ke kai yuva netaa apni hi party ke senior netaaon se naaraaz hai
 He complained about this to Rahul Gandhi
 is bare main bataaya gaya ki rahul gandhi kaary samiti kii baithak main senior netaaon kii khinchaai karenge
 Something similar happened
 shuukravaar shaam ko jab congress kii is ahm samiti kii baithak hui, to rahul gandhi ne naseehat dene ke bahaane senior netaaon kii jamkar khinchaai kii
 Taking a dig at senior leaders, Rahul Gandhi advised them not to go out of the party line and improve their attitude in front of the media
 sutron ne jaankaree di ki baithak main congress upaadhyaksh ne netaaon kii jamkar khinchaai kii
 He missed no opportunity to criticize
 rahul gandhi ne senior netaaon ko naseehat dete hue kaha, 'aap jo karte hai, chote use kaa anukaran karte hai
 Therefore, care should be taken
 khaskar media se baat karte vakt aap kamjor na najar aaen
 It should also be taken care of that your attitude should not have a bad effect on the young leaders and party workers
 'rahul gandhi yaheen nahin ruke
 He made it clear that senior leaders should follow the party line
 unhone kaha, 'senior log sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ke bare main janata ko bataaen
 Everyone should follow the line that the party decides on an issue
 'gauralatab he ki 30 noujvaan netaaon se rahul gandhi ne chunavi taiyaariyon par baat kii, to rahul ko kuch varisht netaaon ko lekar ulahne sunne pade
 Young leaders complained to Rahul bluntly that from the body language and behavior of our senior leaders it seems as if they have accepted that the party is losing the election
 iske baad aaj tak ne guuruuvaar ko hi report di thi ki senior netaaon ke ravaiye ko lekar rahul gandhi congress kaary samiti ke sadasyon ke saath charchaa karenge
 The proof of this is the tweet of Rifat Javed, managing editor (input) of TV Today Group, which he shared on Thursday
 # rahulgandhito meet CWC members tomorrow
 Will admonish senior party leaders on their defeatist attitude
 First on@aajtak@headlinestoday— Rifat Jawaid (@rifatjawaid)february 20, 2014ek baar phir aaj tak ne sabit kar diya he ki jab baat khabaron kii hoti he to ham sabase tej to hai hi, saath main sabase sateek or vishwasaneey bhi
 The family of a crane businessman in Faridabad is accused of beating a woman working in her home

 After this, the woman brought them to the police station
 mahila kaa aarope he ki police ne bhi use nirvastr kar peeta he
 Injured by this, her husband ate poison which is fighting to the death in the hospital
 police ne chah din baad jaakar paanch logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 All the accused are still absconding

 On Facebook, Vadra wrote that this decision of the Supreme Court is worthy of respect and admiration
 wadra ne likhaa ki road sefti kii disha main ye ek bada kadam hoga
 i lost my sister (she was just 33) in an unfortunate accident due to being indifferent to safety norms on the roads
 main puri tarah se haive ke saath sharaab kii briki ko band karne kaa samarthan karata hum
 However, Vadra also mentioned the damage caused by it
 unhone likhaa ki isse hospitility industry par iskaa bura prabhaav padegaa or kareeb 1 million karmchaaree prabhavit ho sakate hai
 Robert Wadrane further wrote that according to media reports, some sellers are selling liquor dishonestly
 yah aadesh ke uddeshy ko dharashayi karata he
 This will increase corruption and black marketing of alcohol
 mujhe aashaa he ki aadesh main kuch sanshodhano ke saath bhavishya main lagu kiya jaataa he to rojgaar or udyog ko nuksaan ko roka ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court, in its December 15, 2016 order, prohibited liquor shops within 500 meters within both national and state highways
 haalanki supreme court ne sikkim or meghalaya ko pratibandh se puri tarah se chhot dais jabaki himachal pradesh ko haive se lage 20,000 yaa kam aabaadi vaale sthaneey nikaayon main 220 meter duuri kii seemaa ke praavdhaan main daal diya he

 vanade main mili haar ke liye dhoni ballebaajon ko sabase zyada doshi maanate hai
 For Dhoni, the failure of the middle order is the biggest reason for not winning

 i hope the players will be able to do it
 jaahir he dhoni hataash nahin hue he, lekin unhone middle order main ballebaaji karne vaale saare khilaadiyon ko or jimmedaari se ballebaaji karne ko kaha he
 In the media and perhaps also in the team, Dhoni expressed his opinion with impunity on the questions that are being raised about the batting order
 
 
 dhoni ke mutabik yah kahana bahut aasaan he ki main us number par ballebaaji nahin karuunga, magar team kii jarurat he to kerani padegi
 The gesture is apparently towards Virat Kohli, who got the news that he is not liking tampering with his batting order
 sapa-congress gathbandhan ke baad dhire-dhire siton par bantwaaraa hota ja rahaa he
 On Thursday, 10 seats were divided in Amethi and Rae Bareli districts, most important for the Congress
 sapa donon jilon main kul do siton par or congress 8 siton par chunaav ladegi
 In fact, the SP had fielded candidates in the first few seats due to which the post-alliance candidates were in a dilemma

 Mukesh had joined SP in the presence of Shivpal and Azam

 On Thursday, Congress fielded its candidate from Payagpur seat, Congress has made Bhagat Ram Mishra its candidate
 is seat par sapa ne mukesh shrivastav ko tikat diya tha
 But after the alliance, this seat was also confused because Mukesh won on this seat on Congress ticket
 gauratlab he ki kuch maheenon pehle mukesh shrivastav congress chhod sapa main shaamil ho gaye the
 The Congress was preparing for the seat, according to pressure sources, the Congress had been asserting its right on this seat for a long time

 Recently, at the election rally in Lakhimpur, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav assured Mukesh to contest again, after which the atmosphere in the Congress camp was heated

 rajasthan ke nagaur main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii salanaa baithak kaa mukhya mandap dow
 Bhimrao was dedicated to Ambedkar
 pravesh dwaar par hi ambedkar kii badi-si tasviir or andar ghuste hi dayee taraf ek chote-se mandap main sangh ke purv sarasanghachaalak bala sahab devaras kii tasviir ke saath chitra pradarshnee lagaai gai thi
 In this meeting of March 11-13, the Sangh through a special resolution on social harmony appealed to all citizens, religious and social organizations to make efforts towards an equitable and exploitative society
 sangh kii is disha main lagaataar pahal uski suvichaarit ranneeti kaa hissaa he taaki kah daliton-pichhadon main apni paith badha sake
 In 1973-74, Deoras launched a special campaign to remove untouchability from Hindu society
 in pratikon ke jariye sangh 'baba sahab' se 'bala sahab' tak ke vichaaron ko ek frem main feet karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 Therefore, he considers the reservation of Scheduled Castes and Tribes justified, but his words on reservation of backward have become a problem for BJP
 nagaur main baithak samaapt hone ke baad media se rou-ba-rou sangh ke sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi se haryana ke jaaton or gujarat main patidaaron kii ore se aarakshan ke sangharsh par sawaal poocha gaya to unka kahana tha, ''samaaj kaa sampann varg bhi jab aarakshan kii maang karata he to hamen lagata he ki yah soch sahi disha main nahin he
 The rich should help the weaker sections, but instead of doing so, it is against Ambedkar's thinking to ask for reservation
 '' is kadi main india today ke saath vichaar saajha karte hue sangh ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya kehete hai, ''jat or patel sampann varg rahe hai
 Instead of asking for these, others should be given facility
 daliton main bhi jo kamjor varg he, un tak 60 saal baad bhi aarakshan kaa laabh nahin pahunchaa he to uskaa adhyayan hona chahie
 Only the people of the society should come forward in this
 yahi baat sarasanghachaalak (mohan bhagwat) ji ne bhi us samay (bihar chunaav se ain pehle) kahi thi
 "what is the Sangh's strategy? Recently, the violent agitation by the Jats in Haryana to demand reservation, it has brought into force the ruling BJP at the Center and in the state
" gujarat main bhi patidaar hinsak andolan kar chuke hai
 These movements naturally increased the concern of the Sangh
 sangh parivaar se jude ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''sangh hameshaa ek raashtra ke rup main sochataa he or sajaateey samaaj kii baat karne vaala har shaks yaa sanghathan vahi kahegaa jo sarasanghachaalak ne bihar chunaav ke samay kaha tha yaa ab nagaur baithak se aawaaj nikali he
 "the Sangh believes that due to politics and vote bank, the issue of reservation of backward classes keeps cropping up
" uski chintaa is baat ko lekar bhi he ki log samaaj or desh ke liye mahaan kaary karne vaali vibhootiyon kii jayanti jati ke naam par manaate hai, jo saamaajik abhishaap he
 While the Sangh never held a convention in the name of caste till its inception
 uskaa maananaa he ki satta ke liye rajnatik logon ne jati ke naam par saamaajik abhishaap ko badhaava diya or vartmaan paridrishy main dekha jaae to yah kaise khatm hoga or isaki shuruyaat koun karegaa, isaki koi tasviir nahin dikhti
 However, the Sangh's thinking on dalit-adivasi reservation is somewhat soft
 uskaa vichaar he ki sadiyon se saamaajik anyaay ke shikaar logon ko sahaara dena kisi bhi raashtra kaa dharm he, lekin us aad main siyaasi goti feet karnaa galat he
 The Sangh wants that a nationwide debate should be held on reservation and the latest statement of Sangh after Bhagwat is also in the same context
 lekin ek netaa yah maanate hai ki philhal aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa
 Bhagwat's statement gave direction to the volunteers, but the Sangh Parivar's dilemma is that the BJP, its ideological organization working in the political arena, cannot support the review of reservation under any circumstances
 kaise nigle yaa ugale bijepi?bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pehali baar bijepi main obisi morcha kaa gathan kiya to pichley saal 10 july ko is nae morche ke sammelan main unhone kaha tha, ''ham satta main bahut kam samay rahe hai, lekin sabase zyada obisi mukhyamantri, saansad-vidhayak bijepi ne die hai or aaj bhi is varg ke sabase zyada saansad-vidhayak bijepi ke paas hai
 Even the first OBC Prime Minister has been given to the country
 ''loksabhaa chunaav main arakshit varg se mila samarthanshah ke is utsaah kii vajah loksabhaa chunaav main party ko obisi se mila apaar samarthan he
 The BJP received 34 per cent OBC votes, 12 per cent more than the 2009 general election
 jabaki 282 loksabhaa siton main se 244 siten sirf hindi pattee main hasil karne vaali bijepi ko is pattee se 48 fisadi obisi vot hasil hue the
 In two of the eight states, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP chief minister is from the OBC community
 akele uttar pradesh main bijepi ke kul 71 saansadon main se 26 obisi ke hai
 But the bjp's top leadership is breathless with the successive statements of the Sangh reviewing the reservation
 sutron ke mutabik, bijepi ke sheersh ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki bhaiyyaji agar chaahate to aarakshan sambandhi sawaal par is tarah ke bayaan se batch sakate the, kyonki centre ke saath-saath jin rajyon main in dinon aarakshan ko lekar hinsak jaateey sangharsh kii sthiti paidaa hui, vahaan bhi bijepi kii sarkarein hai
 In the present situation, the party is considering the Sangh's statement as unnecessary because special initiative is being taken by the party to provide reservation to Jats in Haryana
 party ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''jaaton ko aarakshan dene ke baad phir adaalat main chunauti di gai or vah pehle kii tarah hi khaarij ho gaya to yahi sandesh jayega ki bijepi ne sangh ke dabaav main jaan-boojhkar sahi dhang se pairvi nahin kii
 In such a situation, dealing with the situation will become more difficult
 ''bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke samay bhi pichley saal 21 sitambar ko jab bhagwat kii ore se paanchajnya ko die gaye intervyuu par bavaal machaa tha to party ne sangh se guhaar lagaakar damege control kii koshish kii thi
 But this time BJP has kept silence on this whole issue
 sutron ke mutabik, sangh ke bayaan ke baad party pravaktaaon ko nirdesh de diya gaya ki is masale par koi tippanee nahin kerani he
 However, on the issue of review of OBC reservation, the National President of BJP OBC Morcha S
 pi
 Singh Baghel told India Today, "the statement made by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Parliament is the stand of the party
" ''14 march ko rajyasabha main bispi netaa mayawati, sapa netaa ramgopal yadav ke aaropon par jetali ne kaha tha, ''sarkaar kii niti spasht he ki aarakshan kii maujuuda vyavastha bani rahegi
 Will remain in any condition
 '' lekin baghel ne maang kii ki jati aadhaarit janaganana ke aankade saarvajanik kiye jaaen, jinase aarakshan ko lekar bana bhram dur ho sake
 He demanded constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes
 baghel kehete hai, ''jivan ke har sopan (loksabhaa-vidhansabha, sarkaar kii sari laabhakaari yojanaon) main antyoday hona chahie
 Even the lowest level of people should avail reservation, this is social and natural justice
 ''amuman yahi raay sangh kii bhi he, lekin bijepi khud ko aarakshan kii aag main jhulasakar apana pichhadaa aadhaar kamjor nahin karnaa chaahati
 a party leader believes that it is not possible that any caste can be withdrawn after being given the benefit of reservation
 yah sirf svaichhik taur se ho saktaa he
 However, there is also an opinion in the party that the way Rajnath Singh, while being the Chief Minister of UP, took the initiative to set reservation within the reservation by forming a bunch of two-three-three castes based on a report related to social justice
 Similar initiatives are needed
 haalanki is mudde par vivaad ko dekhte hue sangh kii daleel he ki aarakshan kii samiksha inhen virgon ke prabud logon ko kerani chahie
 But on the situation of pressure on the government and BJP, a senior Sangh official says that no matter the party in power, it does not matter to the Sangh, its job is to create public awareness in the society so that the governments are forced to obey
 
 lekin sangh kii pahal ko obisi saansadon ke forum ke adhyaksh or congress saansad ve
 Hanumantha Rao says that the Sangh wants to abolish the reservation, hence the new Surre is leaving, while the reality is that despite the 27 per cent reservation, the number of obcs in any region has not reached more than 9-10 per cent
 sansad ke donon sadanon ko milakar obisi saansadon kii sankhya 15veen loksabhaa main 135 thi jo 16veen loksabhaa main ghatakar 100 ke kareeb rah gai he
 Certainly, the BJP, which has achieved more success than expected in the Lok Sabha elections and the subsequent haryana-maharashtra elections, does not want to lose its base in the OBC vote bank
 haalanki bihar main vah chot kha chuki he kyonki aarakshan par bhagwat ke bayaan se upje vivaad ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi or samoochee bijepi ne jis tarah pichhadon ke hitaishi hone kaa dambh bharaa, usase uske agade voter bhi khafa ho gaye
 Therefore, BJP is back in breath due to the fast move of the Sangh
 vakt ke saath aresas kii kadamtalvakt ke saath kadamtal kii jugat main aresas ne saahasik rukh akhriyaar kar rakhaa he
 This was also reflected in the decisions of his All India House of Representatives in Nagaur
 yuvaaon ko lubhaane ke liye usne apane ganavesh main badlaav kar liya he to usne aarakshan par yah jaanate hue bhi bebaak raay jaahir kii he ki isse bijepi kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 Indeed, its intention is to attract the young power that considers reservation as non-essential
 yuvaaon ko lubhaane vaale 'rashtrawaad' ke maujuuda jwalanth mudde par bhi uskaa rukh saaf tha or usne kuch vishvavidhyalayon main lagane vaale kathith deshvirohi naaron kii ninda kii
 In addition, while introducing progressive thinking, she supported the entry of women into temples
 langik samanta ke vishay par nagpur kii aresas kii sabha ne media se baatcheet main saaf kiya ki vah hindu mandiron ke garbhagrihon main mahilaon ke pravesh ke paksh main he
 But he said that the process of admission should be decided through deep deliberation and cooperation, not through confrontation
 bijepi ke mahasachiv muralidhar raav kehete hai, ''aresas hameshaa se dharmik kitabon kii pragatisheel vyakhya ke paksh main rahaa he
 And the Vedas say that there is nothing like man or woman in front of divine power
 kai jaankaar aresas ke liye jis nai soch kii baat kehete hai vah nai nahin he, balki shuruyaat se hi uski vichaardhaara kaa hissaa rahi he
 Rao has been a confidant of Dattopant Thengdi, former convenor of the rss's Swadeshi Jagran Manch and a late leader of the RSS
 baharhaal, jis faisle ne media main vastav main sansani paidaa kii, vah aresas ke ganavesh main kiya jane vaala badlaav he
 Now brown pants have been replaced by khaki knickers
 is mudde par 2010 se hi aresas main bahes hoti aa rahi thi
 The main reason for the change in uniform was the attempt to attract youth in this 91-year-old organization
 lekin pahanaave main badlaav hi unhen aakarshith karne ke liye kaaphi nahin ho saktaa
 The leadership of the Sangh knows that the fight to bring youth into the organization will also be fought on the ideology front
 mandap main lagi baba sahab devaras kii tasveerpichley saal kareeb 1
 1
5 million youths were trained in residential camps

 She wanted to change jobs and in this desire she met a man named Nitin

 The girl felt bad that is why she complained to Vijay Pandey, the senior's senior
 ladki ko laga ki sab thik ho gaya he, lekin yaheen se us khel kii shuruyaat hui, jiske bhavar main funskar aaj vah police stesan ke chakkar lagane ko majaboor he
 In fact, after Nitin's complaint, Vijay Pandey expressed sympathy to the girl and then came closer to her
 nazdikiyaan is kadar badhin ki donon liv in relation main rahane lage
 Vijay assured the girl that he would marry her and with the promise, the girl handed over her all to Vijay
 din beete, lekin samay ke saath ab vijay shaadi kii baat par ukhdane laga
 The girl got suspicious and when the matter was opened, she was about to slide under the feet
 ladki ko bataaya gaya ki uske saath ab tak jo bhi hua he vah ek khel tha
 The result of a condition that was struck between Nitin and Vijay
 asal main nitin or vijay gahare dost the
 The girl did not give emotion to Nitin, due to which both conspired to steal her pride and under this, Vijay continued to make her a victim of his lust
 aisa nahin he ki maamla khulne ke baad sab khatm ho gaya

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran leader and former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj died on Tuesday, August 6, 2019 after a heart attack
 sushamaa swaraj dilli kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri bhi raheen
 After Sushma Swaraj, Sheila Dixit of Congress became the Chief Minister of Delhi who ruled Delhi continuously for 15 years
 is lihaaj se dekhen to shila dikshit dilli kii duusari mukhyamantri thim
 It is also a strange coincidence that both the former women chief ministers of Delhi died within 18 days
 dilliwaalon ne itane kam antaraal main apane jamaane main prasiddh raheen do purv mukhyamantriyon ko kho diya
 After the death of Sheila Dixit, Sushma Swaraj tweeted and mourned
 sushamaa ne likhaa tha, 'shila dikshit ke achaanak nidhan ke bare main jaanakar dukhi hum
 We were adversaries in politics, but were friends in personal life
 vah ek behtareen insaan thim
 However, Sheila Dixit's tribute meeting is being held in Delhi on August 10, and it was believed that if Sushma Swaraj were alive, she would have attended that tribute meeting
 sanyog kaa rishta20 july 2019 ko shila dikshit ke nidhan kii khabar bhi achaanak mili thi jaise mangalvaar ko sushamaa swaraj ke nidhan kii khabar mili
 It was also a coincidence with Sushma Swaraj and Sheila Dixit that the two leaders remained active until shortly before their deaths
 sushamaa swaraj ne heart atake se pehle anuchhed 370 ko lekar twit kiya or pradhanmantri narendra modi, grahamantri amit shah ko badhai di thi
 Sheila Dixit died when Priyanka Gandhi arrived in Sonbhadra, Uttar Pradesh, to meet the victims' family after the massacre of the tribals, but was arrested on the way
 shila dikshit ke hawaale se bataaya gaya ki vah priyanka gandhi kii giraftaar ke virodh main dilli main pradarshan karengi
 But Sheila Dixit died on the same day
 vahiin sushamaa ne kaha harish salve ko ghar bulaayaa tha kyonki vah kulbhushan maamle main unhen 1 rupee kii fees adaa karnaa chaahati thim
 Salve fought Kulbhushan's case in the International Court of Justice at a fee of 1 rupee
 yani dilli kii donon purv mukhyamantri nidhan se kuch samay pehle tak sakriy raheen
 Sushma Swaraj rightly wrote about Sheila Dixit that we were opposed to each other in politics, but were friends in personal life
 rafel kaa sauda upie ke kaarykaal main kiya gaya tha, keemten us dauraan tay kii gai thim,endieki sarkaar to us keemat se bhi kam main rafel laa rahi he
 The Supreme Court has justified both the price and the process, so far it is right to blame the government
 yah kahana he vitt mantri arun jetali kaa
 Jaitley, who reached Agenda Aaj Tak, was answering Rajdeep Sardesai's questions
 jetali ne kaha kaha ki rafel maamle main rahul gandhi ne jhooth or safed jhooth bolaa
 Jaitley said that it is important to understand why Rafael is important for us
 kargil yudd main hamen shahadat deni padi kyonki dushman oonchai par baitha hua tha or ham bandook se waar kar rahe the
 If we had a combat plane, we could hit from 2-3 km away, which would have reduced our losses
 kargil yuddh ke baad sena ne demand kii ki hamen combet plane chahie
 The UPA government took the matter of Rafael, everything was finalized, but then Defense Minister AK Antony wrote on file in 2012 that approve butt restructuring
 aisa unhone kyon likhaa yah kisi ko nahin maaloom
 Jaitley said that Rahul Gandhi lied and white lied on Rafael issue
 jhooth kii aayu bahut kam hoti he
 Rahul Gandhi should understand the seriousness of the issue
 sena ko 2008 main yah rafel jaisaa vimaan chahie tha lekin aaj tak ham nahin de paae
 We brought 20 percent cheaper aircraft than the agreement that Congress had made
 uski hathiyaar main hamane 20 fisadi bachat kii
 On the question that if you are so confident then why do not you form the JPC on this issue
 jetali ne kaha ki jepisi main bijepi kaa bahumat hoga lekin uskaa koi phayda nahin hone vaala
 Jaitley said that the Supreme Court has clearly stated that the price and procedure of Rafael Deal is perfect but some people are not ready to accept it
 yah poochne par aap logon ne tathyon main sandhodhan karaayaa, is par jetali kaa kahana tha yah saamaanya prakriya he aup tathy kii jaankaree milane par usase court ko avgat karana kahin se bhi galat nahin he

 mujhe film main ek bhi kubi nazar nahin ai isliye meri ore se film ko ek star!

 Now speaking of the strengths and shortcomings of the film, i think that there are flaws in the film
 phir chaahe kahani ho, screenple ho, acting ho yaa phir film kaa nirdesan ho
 'the Legend of Michael Mishra' does not make you feel interesting nor can you keep the audience hooked at any turn
 aap film dekhte vakt yahi sochate rahenge ki diarector or actor akhir kar kya rahe hai or akhir kya sochakar yah film banaai he
 i could not see a single quality in the film, so on my behalf, the film was a star! 'da lijend of maaikel mishra' kisi bhi mode par aapako na to rochak lagati he or na hi darshakon ko baandhakar rakh paati he

 uttarakhand sarkaar or vahaan ke privet medical college kaa shukriya
 There is a crime that would have prevented them from becoming moral burdens one day
 apane nagarikon se aarthik zyaadati karnaa thik nahin he
 The manner in which the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand has withdrawn the decision to increase the fee of 400 percent in three private medical colleges there, it should be praised, it is expected that this will not happen with the students
 aap jaanate hai ki prime time main ham do dinon se yahi dikhaa rahe the ki rajya ke cabinet ne privet medical college ko fees vruddhi kii chhot kya di, 650 chaatro kii saansen hi atak gai thi
 We were still going to do prime time on this issue that it is an economic slavery to be imposed on the citizens, but today our news has changed into the information of freedom they received
 kai dinon se teen privet medical collejon ke 650 chaatr dharne par baithe the
 Because there the first year fees of MBBS was increased from 6 lakhs 70 thousand to 23 lakhs, the fees of the second year was increased from 7 lakhs 25 thousand to 20 lakhs and the fees of the third year was increased from 7 lakhs 36 thousand to 26 lakhs
 yahi nahin jo duusare saal kaa chaatr he use pehle saal kii balance raashi bhi deni thi
 In this way, the second year student had to pay 40 lakh rupees till 31 May
 yahaan piji kii fees 10 lakh se badhaakar 30 lakh kar di gai he
 These students have passed the competition with their talent
 itani fees inke bas kii baat nahin he
 Their parents are employed people
 koi teacher hai to koi tritiy shrenee ke karmchaaree hai
 These parents could not understand anything
 mukhyamantri ne apni pehali pratikriya main fees vruddhi ko sahi tehra diya tha kyonki yah unheen ke cabinut kaa faisla tha
 Good thing, he saw the inhuman effect of his decision and took it back
 ummid he ki aane vaale samay main prabandhan kii taraf se aisi koi chaalaaki nahin kii jaaegi
 The trustees of Guru Ram Rai Medical College should also be thanked
 kya koi shikshak yaa major rank kaa hi afasar do maheene main 40 lakh de saktaa he
 Of course, the fees of private medical colleges have increased to 40 lakh 50 lakh but it was not right to increase it from 6 lakh to 23 lakh
 pehle se hi fees 40 lakh hoti to shaayad ye log yahaan admician hi nahin lete
 Now feeling relieved at this decision
 shaayad kuch din thik se so paaenge, varna is faisle ne unke hosh uda die the
 Even if they sold their homes, they could not pay these fees

 sibiesai ke chaatro ko bhi dhyaan se sunanaa chahie
 You know that sometime after the online examination, the examination board issues the answer, which is called answer key
 isse chaatr milaate hai ki unhone jo jawaab diya he sahi he yaa galat
 Sometimes the answers are also wrong
 ab agar jawaab galat he to ise sabit chaatr ko hi karnaa he
 That is not enough to prove the same question to a student wrong, the students said that every student has to prove that wrong question wrong
 madhya pradesh lok seva ayog kii isi farvari main pariksha hui
 15 answers were disputed
 to chaatro se kaha ki galat sabit karnaa he to prati sawaal 100 rupee dene honge yani ek chaatr ko 1500 rupee dene honge tab jaakar vah daavedaari kar paaegaa
 Is it not good that the Commission itself investigate whether there is any deficiency in the questions and answers given by it
 ulti chaatro se paise lekar galat sabit karne kaa kya tuk banataa he
 The Punjab government has gone one step further
 punjab sarkaar ke sabordinate sarvice salection board ne ek notification jari kiya he ki 8 april ko website par prashn patron ke jawaab de die jaaenge
 If a student finds an answer to be incorrect, he will have to fill a form
 farm bharne ke liye 590 rupee kaa draft bhejnaa hoga
 If the student's claim turns out to be correct, then the money will be retained if the money is not returned
 is farm kaa swaroop bataata he ki agar koi ek sawaal galat he to saare chaatro ko 590 kaa draft banaakar alag alag daawey karne honge
 Claiming one or challenging one will not be considered a retaliation
 agar aisa he to yah bhayankar he
 Sheer loot
 kaayade se yah hona chahie ki agar koi chaatr sawaal karata he ki falaan prashn patr galat he, to ayog ko khud hi bataanaa chahie ki uskaa daawa sahi he yaa galat
 It is not that in order to earn money, two to four questions are being disputed in such exams because now you will find many such exams in the country, in which one to 15 and sometimes 40 questions are wrong

 We do not even know how many such examinations take place, but if the HR Minister wants, then the students can get great relief

 It will take 15 more days to decide on which July will take place
 shiksha sachiv kehete hai ki shikaayatein aati hai magar har shikaayat ke aadhaar par pariksha radd nahin kar sakate hai
 This is true, but it does not give an answer as to what action was taken on the complaint that came
 aaj ek chaatr saamne aayaa he, wo daawa kar rahaa he ki 17 march ko hi usne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr likh diya tha magar kisi ne dhyaan nahin rakhaa

 ab kah rahe hai ki ise thik karnaa hoga
 At the same time, former HRD Minister Kapil Sibal is demanding that the Prime Minister apologize to the students, but Sibal's question is something else
 wo kah rahe hai ki ab sirf ek hi prashn patr puure desh ke liye hota he, isse li hona aasaan ho gaya he
 The comments sarkaar ko ek kaam or karnaa chahie
 It can have the role of Minister of Civil Aviation and Minister of Railways
 wo yah ki sibiesai ke chaatr apana admit card dikhaakar tikat kaa puraa paisa waapas le sakate hai
 There are many parents who had ticketed to travel in India and outside India after the examination is over
 ab cancil karaayenge to unhen 40 hazaar se lekar 1 lakh tak kaa chuunaa lag saktaa he
 Since the fault is with the government, the government should make up for it
 godi media jo shiksha ke buniyadi sawaalon ko chhod kar hindu muslim tibet main aapako fansaa kar rakhana chahta he aaj kal sibiesai ke bahaane apni chhavi sudhaar rahaa he
 He is doing the news of paper leak as if he is very worried
 chintaa hoti to vah staff salection kamishan ke chaatro ne jo sawaal uthaae use bhi uthaata
 In Madhya Pradesh also talks about the students who are agitating for the Public Service Commission examination, there is a problem with the examination of Patwari
 vahaan se chaatr likh rahe hai ki patawaari kii pariksha ek privet company ne karai he
 Those who have fewer numbers are successful and those who have more are failed
 in sab baton ko ham kab gambhirtha se lenge
 Similarly, students are performing in Bengal for jobs and examinations, daily demonstrations are also held in UP, and also in Punjab
 sibiesai ke chaatro kii prishthbhumi hi he ki itnaa dhyaan mil gaya varanaa wo bhi samajhen ki shiksha vyavastha ko lekar kya haalat he desh main
 They will pass the 12th but after that how will college be
 kya sabko dilli or mumbai hi aate rahanaa hoga
 Why is there no such college in Bhopal and Patna to send someone from Delhi
 mere sawaal buniyadi hai or zaruri
 Before who wins in 2019, it is important to ask where our child will study
 kaise padhegaa
 For several days 650 students from three private medical colleges were sitting on dharna
 kyonki vahaan embibies kii pehle saal kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh, duusare saal kii fees 7 lakh 25 hazaar se badhaakar 20 lakh or tisare saal kii fees 7 lakh 36 hazaar se badhaakar 26 lakh kar di gai thi
 Not only this, who is a second year student, he also had to give the balance amount of the first year
 is tarah duusare saal ke chaatr ko 31 may tak 40 lakh rupee dene the
 Here PG fees have been increased from 10 lakhs to 30 lakhs
 ye chaatr apni pratibha se pratiyogita paas kar aae hai
 Such a fee is not a matter of their control
 inke maa baap naukareepesha log hai
 Some are teachers and some are third-class employees
 in maa baap ko kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa tha
 The Chief Minister in his first response had justified the hike in fees as it was his decision of his cabinet
 acchhee baat he ki unhen apane faisle kaa amanviya asar dikh gaya or use waapas le liya
 It is expected that no such manipulation will be done by the management in the coming time
 guru ram raay medical kalege ke trustee kaa bhi shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Can any teacher or officer of major rank give 40 lakhs in two months
 zarur privet medical collejon kii fees 40 lakh 50 lakh ho gai he magar 6 lakh se badhaakar 23 lakh karnaa thik nahin tha
 If the fees were already 40 lakhs, then these people might not take admission here
 ab is faisle par raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Maybe some days will be able to sleep properly, or else this decision blew her senses
 ghar bhi bechate to bhi ye fees nahin de sakate the
 The fourth and fifth year seniors have also supported the movement of their junior students
 yahi acchhee baat he
 If you look at the issues of the rights of citizens, then the pain of others will also be seen
 indian medical association ke sadasyon ne bhi chaatro kaa saath diya
 Ravinder ji, who raised this issue by creating a parent association, wants to know the answers to some more questions
 mukhyamantri ne fees vruddhi vaapasi kaa elaan to kar diya he lekin kya unhone apane cabinet kaa faisla waapas le liya
 Is there still any possibility of increasing such fees? aap raajnneeti kaa akaash dekhie, vahaan hindu muslim tanaav ke alaava koi doosraa topic nahin he
 The general public is wandering from here to there by writing their problems on the banner poster
 punjab se ek yuvak ne ek soochna di he
 CBSE students should also listen carefully
 aap jaanate hai ki online pariksha ke kuch samay baad pariksha board jawaab jari karata he, jise ancer kii kehete hai
 This allows students to match whether the answer given by them is true or false
 kai baar jawaab bhi galat hote hai
 Now if the answer is wrong, it has to be proved by the student
 wo bhi ek hi sawaal ko ek chaatr galat sabit kar de kaaphi nahin he, chaatro ne bataaya ki har chaatr ko us galat sawaal ko galat sabit karnaa hota he
 Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission exam took place this February
 15 jawaab vivaadit the
 So told the students that if they want to prove wrong then they will have to pay Rs 100 per question, that means a student will have to pay 1500 rupees, then he will be able to claim
 kya acha nahin hota ki ayog khud hi jaanch kare ki uske dwaara puche gaye sawaal or die gaye jawaab main koi kami to nahin he
 What makes sense to prove wrong by taking money from vomiting students
 punjab sarkaar to ek kadam or aage chali gai he
 The Subordinate Service Selection Board of Punjab Government has issued a notification that on April 8, the questions will be answered on the website
 kisi chaatr ko agar koi jawaab galat lagata he to use ek farm bharna hoga
 a draft of Rs 590 will have to be sent to fill the form
 agar chaatr kaa daawa sahi niklaa to paise waapas or nahin niklaa to paise rakh liye jaaenge
 The format of this form states that if any one question is wrong, then all the students will have to make different claims by making a draft of 590
 ek ke daawey karne se yaa chunauti dene sabake badale kaa daawa nahin mana jayega
 If so, it is terrible
 saraasar lut he
 It should be done that if a student questions that a particular question paper is wrong, then the commission itself should tell whether its claim is true or false
 kahin aisa to nahin ki paisa kamaane ke liye har pariksha main do chaar sawaal is tarah vivaadit rup se chhod die ja rahe hai kyonki ab aisi kai parikshaayen aapako desh bhar main milengi jinamein ek se lekar 15 or kabhi kabhi 40 prashn galat hote hai
 The CBSE Class 10 math exam date has troubled students in many ways
 maanav sansaadhan mantri ko dasvin or 12veen ke baad hone vaali parikshaon kii tarikhon ke bare main bhi nae sire se faisla karnaa hoga
 a student of class x from Sitamarhi in Bihar has written a letter which adds a new dimension to this problem
 aap bhi padhie
 
 
 Ravish sir, main aniket saurav (sitamarhi bihar se) ek 10veen kaa chaatr hum
 i am taking the exam
 jab main 10veen kaa ganit kaa paper dekar ghar aayaa to pataa chalaa ki pariksha radd ho gai he or shaayad nai pariksha 26 april ko he
 i have filled the form of Banaras Hindu School
 iske liye 406 rupee kaa farm bharaa he
 a ticket of Rs 470 has been taken for the train from Patna to Banaras
 main 23 ko jaakar 24 ko banaras kaa train pakadta hum to meri pariksha chhot jaaegi
 My dream is broken Ravish sir, to study in an outside college, parents cannot teach in expensive universities
 mere jaise bahut bacchon kaa sapana tut gaya he
 Now if the Prime Minister expresses sorrow, what benefit? kaaphi dukhi hum, kuch bhi karne main man nahin lag rahaa he
 If you can ask BHU to extend the date, it would be a great blessing
 aniket saurabh, sitamarhi bihar If this is the case, then these things should be brought immediately to the notice of HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar so that students are not debarred from appearing in other entrance examinations due to cancellation of examination
 aap jaanate hai ki banaras hindu vidhyalay bhi biechayu kaa hi hissaa he
 Here the entrance exam for 11th
 aisi kitni parikshaayen kahaan kahaan hoti hai, hamen pataa bhi nahin magar maanav sansaadhan mantri chahenge to chaatro ko badi raahat mil sakati he
 On March 30, Anil Swarup, Education Secretary, Government of India, appeared in front of the press and said that the Mathematics examination of class x would be held in July
 agar radd hogi to sirf haryana or dilli ke kshetra ke liye kii jaaegi
 Economics exam will be held on 25 April
 kis july ko hogi iskaa faisla karne main abhi 15 din or lagenge
 The Education Secretary says that complaints come but cannot cancel the examination on the basis of every complaint
 yah baat sahi he magar isse yah jawaab nahin miltaa ki jo shikaayat ai us par kya ection liya gaya
 Today a student has surfaced, claiming that he had written a letter to the Prime Minister's Office on March 17, but no one noticed
 maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne bhi mana he ki prashn patr ko chhapane se lekar pahunchane ke bich kai charan hote hai
 Hence the risk of leaks increases
 kam se kam unhone mana to
 Now saying that it has to be fixed
 vahiin purv maanav sansaadhan mantri kapil sibbal maang kar rahe hai ki pradhanmantri chaatro se maafee maangen magar sibbal kaa sawaal kuch or he
 They are saying that now only one question paper is for the whole country, it has become easier to leak
 tippaniyan The government should do one more thing
 isamen naagarik uddyan mantri or rail mantri kii bhoomika ho sakati he
 That is, CBSE students can withdraw their full ticket money by showing their admit card
 bahut se maa baap aise hai jinhone pariksha khatm hone ke baad bharat main or bharat ke baahar ghoomane ke liye tikat kataaya tha
 If you cancel now, it may cost them between 40 thousand and 1 lakh
 chunki galati sarkaar kii he isliye sarkaar ko hi isaki bharpai kerani chahie
 The dock media, which wants to leave the basic questions of education and entice you into Hindu Muslim Tibet, is now improving its image on the pretext of CBSE
 wo paper li kii khabaron ko aise kar rahaa he jaise use bahut chintaa he
 Had he worried, he would have also raised the questions raised by the students of the Staff Selection Commission
 madhya pradesh main lokseva ayog kii pariksha ko lekar jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai unki bhi baat karata, vahaan patawaari kii pariksha ko lekar samasya he
 From there, students are writing that a private company has conducted the examination of Patwari
 jinke kam number hai ve safal hai or jinke zyaada hai ve fail hai
 When will we take all these things seriously? isi tarah chaatr naukariyon or pariksha ko lekar bengal main bhi pradarshan kar rahe hai, upi main bhi rose pradarshan hote hai, or punjab main bhi
 It is the background of CBSE students that got so much attention or else they also understand what is the situation in the country regarding education system
 ve 12veen to paas kar jaaenge magar uske baad college kaisaa milegaa
 Will everyone have to keep coming to Delhi and Mumbai only? bhopal or patna main aisa college kyon nahin he ki koi dilli se vahaan bhej de
 My questions are basic and important
 2019 main koun jitegaa se pehle yah poochna zaruri he ki hamaara aapkaa baccha kahaan padhegaa
 How to read kya koi shikshak yaa major rank kaa hi afasar do maheene main 40 lakh de saktaa he
 Of course, the fees of private medical colleges have increased to 40 lakh 50 lakh but it was not right to increase it from 6 lakh to 23 lakh
 pehle se hi fees 40 lakh hoti to shaayad ye log yahaan admician hi nahin lete
 Now feeling relieved at this decision
 shaayad kuch din thik se so paaenge, varna is faisle ne unke hosh uda die the
 Even if they sold their homes, they could not pay these fees
 chauthe or paanchave saal ke senior ne bhi apane junior chaatro ke andolan kaa saath diya he
 That's a good thing
 agar aap muddon ko naagarik ke adhikaar kii nazar dekhenge to dusron kaa dard bhi apana nazar aayega
 Members of the Indian Medical Association also supported the students
 is mudde ko abhibhavak sangh banaakar uthaane vaale ravindar ji abhi kuch or sawaalon ke jawaab jaananaa chaahate hai
 The Chief Minister has announced the withdrawal of the fee hike, but did he withdraw his cabinet decision
 kya ab bhi itani fees badhane kii koi sambhaavna bachi he
 You see the sky of politics, there is no other topic apart from Hindu Muslim tension
 aam janata apni pareshaaniyon ko binar poster par likhakar yahaan se vahaan bhatak rahi he
 a young man from Punjab has given a notice
 sibiesai ke chaatro ko bhi dhyaan se sunanaa chahie
 You know that sometime after the online examination, the examination board issues the answer, which is called answer key
 isse chaatr milaate hai ki unhone jo jawaab diya he sahi he yaa galat
 Sometimes the answers are also wrong
 ab agar jawaab galat he to ise sabit chaatr ko hi karnaa he
 That is not enough to prove the same question to a student wrong, the students said that every student has to prove that wrong question wrong
 madhya pradesh lok seva ayog kii isi farvari main pariksha hui
 15 answers were disputed
 to chaatro se kaha ki galat sabit karnaa he to prati sawaal 100 rupee dene honge yani ek chaatr ko 1500 rupee dene honge tab jaakar vah daavedaari kar paaegaa
 Is it not good that the Commission itself investigate whether there is any deficiency in the questions and answers given by it
 ulti chaatro se paise lekar galat sabit karne kaa kya tuk banataa he
 The Punjab government has gone one step further
 punjab sarkaar ke sabordinate sarvice salection board ne ek notification jari kiya he ki 8 april ko website par prashn patron ke jawaab de die jaaenge
 If a student finds an answer to be incorrect, he will have to fill a form
 farm bharne ke liye 590 rupee kaa draft bhejnaa hoga
 If the student's claim turns out to be correct, then the money will be retained if the money is not returned
 is farm kaa swaroop bataata he ki agar koi ek sawaal galat he to saare chaatro ko 590 kaa draft banaakar alag alag daawey karne honge
 Claiming one or challenging one will not be considered a retaliation
 agar aisa he to yah bhayankar he
 Sheer loot
 kaayade se yah hona chahie ki agar koi chaatr sawaal karata he ki falaan prashn patr galat he, to ayog ko khud hi bataanaa chahie ki uskaa daawa sahi he yaa galat
 It is not that in order to earn money, two to four questions are being disputed in such exams because now you will find many such exams in the country, in which one to 15 and sometimes 40 questions are wrong
 sibiesai kii dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha kii taarikh ne chaatro ko kai tareeke se pareshaan kiya he
 The HR Minister will also have to decide afresh on the dates of examinations to be held after the tenth and 12th
 bihar ke sitamarhi se dasvin ke ek chaatr ne patr likhaa he jo is samasya main ek nayaa aayam jodta he
 You also study
 
 
 raveesh sar, i am Aniket Saurav (from Sitamarhi Bihar) a 10th standard student
 main pariksha de rahaa hum
 When i came home with a math paper of 10th, it came to know that the exam has been canceled and the new exam is probably on 26 April
 maine banaras hindu vidhyalay kaa farm bharaa he
 For this, a form of 406 rupees is filled
 patna se banaras kii train ke liye 470 rupee kaa tikat liya he
 If i go to 23 and catch a train to Benares on 24, then i will miss my exam
 meraa sapana tut gaya raveesh sar, baahar ke college main padhane kaa, maa baap mahangi uniwarsity main nahin padhaa sakate hai
 The dream of many children like me is broken
 ab agar pradhanmantri dukh zaahir bhi karte hai to kya faaydaa
 i am very sad, i do not feel like doing anything
 kya aap biechayu ko date aage badhaane ke liye kah sakate hai to badi krupa hogi
 Aniket Saurabh, Sitamarhi Bihar agar aisa he to maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke dhyaan main in baton ko turant laayaa janaa chahie taaki pariksha radd hone ke kaaran chaatro ko duusari pravesh parikshaon main shaamil hone se vanchit na hona pade
 You know that Banaras Hindu School is also a part of BHU
 yahaan 11veen ke liye pravesh pariksha hoti he
 We do not even know how many such examinations take place, but if the HR Minister wants, then the students can get great relief
 30 march ko bharat sarkaar ke shiksha sachiv anil swaroop press ke saamne aae or unhone kaha ki dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha july main hogi
 If canceled, it will be done only for the areas of Haryana and Delhi
 arthshaastra kii pariksha 25 april ko hogi
 It will take 15 more days to decide on which July will take place
 shiksha sachiv kehete hai ki shikaayatein aati hai magar har shikaayat ke aadhaar par pariksha radd nahin kar sakate hai
 This is true, but it does not give an answer as to what action was taken on the complaint that came
 aaj ek chaatr saamne aayaa he, wo daawa kar rahaa he ki 17 march ko hi usne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr likh diya tha magar kisi ne dhyaan nahin rakhaa
 Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar has also admitted that there are several stages between printing and sending a question paper
 isliye li kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 At least they believed

 ab cancil karaayenge to unhen 40 hazaar se lekar 1 lakh tak kaa chuunaa lag saktaa he

 When i came home with a math paper of 10th, it came to know that the exam has been canceled and the new exam is probably on 26 April

 The dream of many children like me is broken
 ab agar pradhanmantri dukh zaahir bhi karte hai to kya faaydaa
 i am very sad, i do not feel like doing anything

 Aniket Saurabh, Sitamarhi Bihar agar aisa he to maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke dhyaan main in baton ko turant laayaa janaa chahie taaki pariksha radd hone ke kaaran chaatro ko duusari pravesh parikshaon main shaamil hone se vanchit na hona pade
 You know that Banaras Hindu School is also a part of BHU
 yahaan 11veen ke liye pravesh pariksha hoti he
 We do not even know how many such examinations take place, but if the HR Minister wants, then the students can get great relief
 30 march ko bharat sarkaar ke shiksha sachiv anil swaroop press ke saamne aae or unhone kaha ki dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha july main hogi
 If canceled, it will be done only for the areas of Haryana and Delhi

 It will take 15 more days to decide on which July will take place
 shiksha sachiv kehete hai ki shikaayatein aati hai magar har shikaayat ke aadhaar par pariksha radd nahin kar sakate hai
 This is true, but it does not give an answer as to what action was taken on the complaint that came
 aaj ek chaatr saamne aayaa he, wo daawa kar rahaa he ki 17 march ko hi usne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr likh diya tha magar kisi ne dhyaan nahin rakhaa
 Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar has also admitted that there are several stages between printing and sending a question paper
 isliye li kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 At least they believed
 ab kah rahe hai ki ise thik karnaa hoga
 At the same time, former HRD Minister Kapil Sibal is demanding that the Prime Minister apologize to the students, but Sibal's question is something else
 wo kah rahe hai ki ab sirf ek hi prashn patr puure desh ke liye hota he, isse li hona aasaan ho gaya he
 The comments sarkaar ko ek kaam or karnaa chahie
 It can have the role of Minister of Civil Aviation and Minister of Railways
 wo yah ki sibiesai ke chaatr apana admit card dikhaakar tikat kaa puraa paisa waapas le sakate hai
 There are many parents who had ticketed to travel in India and outside India after the examination is over
 ab cancil karaayenge to unhen 40 hazaar se lekar 1 lakh tak kaa chuunaa lag saktaa he
 Since the fault is with the government, the government should make up for it
 godi media jo shiksha ke buniyadi sawaalon ko chhod kar hindu muslim tibet main aapako fansaa kar rakhana chahta he aaj kal sibiesai ke bahaane apni chhavi sudhaar rahaa he
 He is doing the news of paper leak as if he is very worried
 chintaa hoti to vah staff salection kamishan ke chaatro ne jo sawaal uthaae use bhi uthaata
 In Madhya Pradesh also talks about the students who are agitating for the Public Service Commission examination, there is a problem with the examination of Patwari
 vahaan se chaatr likh rahe hai ki patawaari kii pariksha ek privet company ne karai he
 Those who have fewer numbers are successful and those who have more are failed
 in sab baton ko ham kab gambhirtha se lenge
 Similarly, students are performing in Bengal for jobs and examinations, daily demonstrations are also held in UP, and also in Punjab
 sibiesai ke chaatro kii prishthbhumi hi he ki itnaa dhyaan mil gaya varanaa wo bhi samajhen ki shiksha vyavastha ko lekar kya haalat he desh main
 They will pass the 12th but after that how will college be

 Why is there no such college in Bhopal and Patna to send someone from Delhi
 mere sawaal buniyadi hai or zaruri
 Before who wins in 2019, it is important to ask where our child will study
 kaise padhegaa
 You see the sky of politics, there is no other topic apart from Hindu Muslim tension
 aam janata apni pareshaaniyon ko binar poster par likhakar yahaan se vahaan bhatak rahi he
 a young man from Punjab has given a notice
 sibiesai ke chaatro ko bhi dhyaan se sunanaa chahie
 You know that sometime after the online examination, the examination board issues the answer, which is called answer key
 isse chaatr milaate hai ki unhone jo jawaab diya he sahi he yaa galat
 Sometimes the answers are also wrong
 ab agar jawaab galat he to ise sabit chaatr ko hi karnaa he
 That is not enough to prove the same question to a student wrong, the students said that every student has to prove that wrong question wrong
 madhya pradesh lok seva ayog kii isi farvari main pariksha hui
 15 answers were disputed
 to chaatro se kaha ki galat sabit karnaa he to prati sawaal 100 rupee dene honge yani ek chaatr ko 1500 rupee dene honge tab jaakar vah daavedaari kar paaegaa
 Is it not good that the Commission itself investigate whether there is any deficiency in the questions and answers given by it
 ulti chaatro se paise lekar galat sabit karne kaa kya tuk banataa he
 The Punjab government has gone one step further
 punjab sarkaar ke sabordinate sarvice salection board ne ek notification jari kiya he ki 8 april ko website par prashn patron ke jawaab de die jaaenge
 If a student finds an answer to be incorrect, he will have to fill a form
 farm bharne ke liye 590 rupee kaa draft bhejnaa hoga
 If the student's claim turns out to be correct, then the money will be retained if the money is not returned
 is farm kaa swaroop bataata he ki agar koi ek sawaal galat he to saare chaatro ko 590 kaa draft banaakar alag alag daawey karne honge
