 com / tbtcmwzzf3 — Varun Dhawan (@varun_dvn) June 29, 2015 jhooth, fareb or dhokhe kii yah ek aisi kahani he, jiskaa sach jaanane ke baad aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 Actually, 5 people working in the same company are kidnapped from the same place in Delhi, at the same time
 par iske aage jo kuch hota he, wo vaaki chaunkaane vaala he
 Saurabh, like everyday, came to his company's rest house to meet his girlfriend Shivika that day
 lekin wo us vakt nahin jaanata tha ki vah ek musiibat main funsane vaala he
 Unaware of the impending danger, he knocks on the door of the room
 kamare kaa daravaaza uski garlfriend shivika ne hi kholaa tha
 Actually Shivika used to work in Saurabh's company
 guzarate vakt ke saath-saath donon ek-duusare ke kareeb aa chuke the
 The conversation of both of them started increasing
 ab donon ek-duusare se pyaar karne lage the
 Shivika gives Saurabh a drink
 pine ke thodi der baad saurabh apane hosh kho baitha
 When Saurabh regains consciousness, he finds himself in an unknown room
 lekin uske saamne uski garlfriend or company ke teen log baithe hue the
 Saurabh had understood so much that he was trapped in some trouble and at the moment he is on the mercy of these people
 saurabh ko hosh main aayaa dekh chaaron main se shivika ne saurabh ko bataaya ki kuch logon ne un sabhi kaa apharan kar liya he or un chaaron ne aparankartaaon ko 80 lakh rupee dene kaa intazaam bhi kar liya he
 If Saurabh wants to save his life, he should give Rs 18 lakh to Kidnappers
 saurabh fouran iske liye raji ho gaya
 He called her home and asked her to give Rs 18 lakh to the kidnappers
 saurabh ke gharavaalon ne bhi kidanapers ko 18 lakh kii phiroti de di
 After receiving the ransom money, the kidnappers freed Saurabh on one condition that he would return the 80 lakh rupees he had given to the rest of his company's employees to save himself from the clutches of Kidnappers
 saurabh iske liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Her kidnapper then released Saurabh on 25 December 2013
 kidanapers ke changul se chhootane ke baad saumbh police ke paas pahunchaa
 The police were also surprised to hear the story of her kidnapping
 lekin police ke saamne sabase bada sawaal yahi tha ki aakhir kisne saurabh kaa apharan kiya tha or is saazish main koun-koun log shaamil the
 Just by keeping these questions in front, the police started their investigation
 police ne saurabh ke un karmchaariyon or uski garlfriend se poochtacha karne kaa faisalaa kiya, jinka uske saath apharan hua tha
 Even after questioning, she could not reach any conclusion
 lekin jab police ne un sabhi se sakhti se poochtacha kii, to unamem se ek police ke saamne tut gaya or usne police ko saurabh kii kidnaping kaa sach bataaya, to sabhi hairaan rah gaye
 Actually, all of them had made a plan to kidnap Saurabh
 kisi ko in par shaq na ho, isliye apharan karne kaa kaam outsource kiya gaya tha
 That is, Kidnapping was done by some other gang
 is plan kaa sabase harahungez karne vaala pahalu yah tha ki kidnaping kii is saazish main saurabh kii garlfriend shivika chouhan bhi shariq thi
 Not only this, Shivika is also the mastermind of this abduction plot
 police ke mutabik shivika chouhan ne saurabh ke yahaan kaam karne vaale raaj walia, arun bohara or sanni ke saath milakar hi is apharan ko anjaam diya
 According to the plan, on December 22, he called Saurabh and called him to his guest house and sedated him by giving him drugs
 iske baad usne saurabh ko baahar se bulaae profeshnal kidanapers ke hawaale kar diya
 Not only this, they all told Saurabh that Kidnappers had kidnapped the four of them besides him
 iske baad kareeb 1 karod kii phiroti vasuulne ke baad saurabh ko chhod diya gaya
 Currently, the police have arrested the four professional kidnappers - Sunil Rathi, Krishna, Ravi and Sandeep - in this case
 lekin is kidnaping kii sajeesh main shaamil saurabh ahuja ke chaaron karmchaaree or garlfriend shivika chouhan abhi faraar hai
 whatsapp is the world's most used instant messaging app and is considered secure
 watsap ko fasebuk ne 2014 main hi kharid liya he
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that private messaging is not just important for Facebook's future, but it is Facebook's future
 darasal mark jakarberg ne ek post likhaa he jo puri tarah se privesi par focusd he

 He has said, 'implementing end-to-end encryption is a good thing for all private communications' There has been a continuous discussion about whatsapp privacy and encryption in India for some time
 phek news or afvaah badi samasya ban kar ubhare hai
 To deal with this, the government wants whatsapp to find the origin of fake news or rumor mongers, but because of end-to-end encryption in whatsapp is impossible
 haal hi main watsap kii taraf se ejeeniyar bharat aae or ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue unhone yahaan tak kaha ki agar sarkaar jis tul kii baat kar rahi he agar use laayaa gaya to watsap jiske liye janaa jaataa he wo nahin rah jayega
 Here he also said that due to end to end encryption, no third person other than the sender and receiver can intercept it, even no agency
 aise main mark jakarberg ke is post se ab saaf he ki watsap main logon ko tres karne ke liye koi tul nahin aayega
 Zuckerberg said, "the future of communication is becoming increasingly private, shifting to encrypted service where people can be confident that they are talking about each other, they are secure and their messages are secure

 punjab ke is siyaasi uthapatak ke baad sawaal uthne lage hai ki khuleam captain or siddhu kii ladaai ho rahi he tab bhi sakht tevar vaale netaa captain amarinder singh siddhu kii cabinet se chuttee kyon nahin kar paa rahe hai
 According to experts, Captain Amarinder took the command of the campaign by putting immense pressure on the party high command during the Punjab assembly elections
 tikaton kaa bantwaaraa tay kiya
 After the Congress's victory in Punjab, Captain started his reign in Punjab
 ye baat party alaakaman ko pasand nahin ai
 Meanwhile, Sidhu got tremendous support from Rahul Gandhi
 priyanka gandhi bhi siddhu ko khaasaa mahatv detii hai
 Captain Amarinder Singh convened a cabinet meeting last Thursday but Sidhu was not present
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad pehali baithak thi
 Sidhu's absence in this further exposed the differences between the two leaders
 mukhyamantri or unke sthaneey nikaay mantri ke bich jubaani jang us samay se shuru he, jab amarinder singh ne rajya ke shahari ilaakon main party ke kharaab pradarshan ke liye siddhu ko jimmedaar tehraaya or kaha ki sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke kadamon se na keval unhen nuksaan hua he, balki gandhi ko bhi
 The reason for the latest dispute between the two is to hold the Chief Minister responsible for not giving tickets to Chandigarh from his wife
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan captain ne aam aadmi party se samjhauta karne se manaa kiya or ummidavaaron ke tikat bhi khud final kiye
 Moreover, Sidhu was mostly kept away from the promotion of Punjab
 duusari taraf rahul gandhi ne siddhu ko amethi bheja or bhopal main digvijay singh ne bhi siddhu ko bulaava bheja tha
 This is the reason why despite all efforts Captain Amarinder is not able to leave Sidhu even after wanting
 navjot siddhu ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki cricket ho yaa raajnneeti, siddhu apni baat rakhane se peeche nahin hatate
 When he had a feud with captain Azharuddin as a cricketer, he left the tour of England and came back
 bijepi main unhen arun jetali lekar aae, baad main unheen se panga lekar party chhod di
 Now Captain in Punjab has confronted Amarinder, whose outcome will tell

 sadakon ko ridizin karne par hoga kamjald hi kiya jayega puure plan kaa elaandilli main pradooshan par lag rahaa he lagaam5 saal main supplai hoga 24 ghante panimukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli kii sadakon ko ridizin karne kaa plan taiyaar kiya he
 On Wednesday, at the Convention Center in New Delhi, Kejriwal has made a new announcement to deal with the traffic problem in Delhi
 yahaan mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ASSOCHAM dwaara yojit 'dilli kii soch' kaarykram main hissaa lene pahunche the
 Arvind Kejriwal said that the traffic problem in Delhi can be eradicated
 jaise dilli kii sadaken bahut chaudee hai, lekin 4 len kii sadak aage chalakar 3 len or phir achaanak 6 len kii ho jaati he
 Such roads of Delhi need to be redesigned
 kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli kii dikkat he ki bahut sari agenciyon kaa hona he
 We had planned to redesign 9 roads but it took 4 and a half years to hire an international consultant
 ab kansaltent hair ho gaya he
 i will announce the entire plan soon
 pradooshan par niyantraravind kejariwal ne pradooshan ke liye uthaae ja rahe kadamon kaa elaan karte hue kaha ki dilli main kaaphi pradooshan kam hua he
 Air quality is in good category for the last 3 months
 hawa itani saaf rahi ki chand or taare bhi aasmaan par nazar aae
 Our aim is to see moon and stars in Delhi 365 days
 pradooshan se nipatane ke liye centre, nigam or dilliwaalon kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Now 365 days of the year pollution has to be reduced
 transport vyavastha sudhaarney ke intjamiske alaava kejariwal ne dilli kii transport vyavastha ko behatar karne ke liye privet sector ko shaamil karne kii baat kahi
 He said that 3 to 4 thousand buses will be connected in public transport, with the help of a mobile app, they will be able to track the location of the bus
 agar bas acchhee hongi to log car bhi chodenge
 We want to connect the private sector which brings luxury buses
 is par bhi ek policy kaa agle 15 din main elaan hoga
 Kejriwal has also promised to clean Delhi in the next 5 years
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki iske baad dilli ko saaf suthra karnaa he
 Delhi is very dirty
 chaaron taraf kooda hi kooda he
 Drains and sewers are flowing
 lekin dilli ko saaf suthra karnaa rocket science nahin he
 The entire world has managed solid waste, so why can't Delhi
 lekin emsidi alag chal rahi he, dilli sarkaar alag, centre sarkaar alag, didie alag chal rahe hai
 Will fix it and show it to Delhi in 5 years
 aage kejariwal ne kaha ki modern shahar loar class ke liye kathor ho jate hai
 But we want a Delhi that takes care of the poor, middle class and everyone's love 
 ham smart dilli chaahate hai jahaan khub technology kaa istemaal ho
 There is a need to know the thoughts and dreams of every Delhi
 24 ghante bijli dene kaa daawakejariwal ne kaha ki pichley 5 saal main dilli kii basic zaruuraton ko thik karne kii koshish kii he
 Today, Delhi gets 24 hours of electricity
 aaj se 3 saal pehle sapane main 24 ghante bijli ke bare main nahin sochataa tha
 There is a list of some areas where local transformers are to be changed
 jameen nahin mil paane kii vajah se dikkat he
 The technique of installing transformer on the pole will solve it
 ab sarkaar kii policy he ki kahin bijli katautee hui to power company ko harjaana dena hoga
 But today Delhi has the cheapest electricity and the company is making profit
 ye isliye hua ki ham eemaandaaree se kaam kar rahe hai, ham idhar udhar se paise nahin banaate
 Panjikariwal claimed to get 24 hours in 5 years, claiming during the program that today 93 percent of the pipeline in Delhi has been laid
 agle dedh saal ke andar dilli kii 100 fisadi tonti se pani milegaa
 But right now there is no water for 24 hours, for which we are working on new technology
 hamaari sarkaar dilli ke har ghar ko barish ke pani ko sangrakshit karne ke liye jodenge
 There will be 24 hours of water in the next 5 years
 aage kejariwal ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar amir or garib ko acchhee swasthya shiksha suvidha de rahi he
 If a government cannot provide this much then it does not have the right to remain in the government
 log tex isliye nahin dete ki netaaon, mukhyamantri or adhikariyon ke gaadi, ghode or bangale chalate rahe
 People pay for tax facilities
 arvind kejariwal ne apni 5 saal kii sarkaar ke dauraan ek bhi red na daalane kaa daawa kiya he
 Kejriwal said that in the last 5 years our government has not killed any raid on industry and business people
 dilli main 2010 main 25 hajaar karod kaa tex collection tha, jo 2015 se 2019 ke bich yah badhkar 30 hajaar karod se 60 hajaar karod tak pahunch gaya he
 Because the merchants trusted us, we stopped the Red Maroney
 main inakam tex main tha, jaanata hum red maarane par kya hota he
 There, not the government, comes personal tax
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main jald hi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Apart from seeking votes on his work, the Kejriwal government is making new announcements daily
 shaharon main jo vyakti har maheene 965 rupee or gaanvon main 781 rupee kharch karata he wo garib nahin mana jayega
 The Planning Commission has said this by filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court
 ayog ne rashtriya sample survey sanghathan ke aankade ke aadhaar par garibi rekha kii paribhaasha main sudhaar karte hue kaha he ki shaharon main rojaanaa 32 rupee or gaavon main rojaanaa 26 rupee kharch karne vaala vyakti garib nahin mana jayega
 In such a situation, they will not be able to take advantage of the plans of the central and state government of those living below the poverty line
 pehle ye aankada shaharon ke liye 20 rupee or gaanvon ke liye 15 rupee tha
 According to the Planning Commission, if the monthly expenditure of a family of four members in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore is Rs 3860, then it will also not be considered poor
 garibi rekha kii is nai paribhaasha ko lekar virodh bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Many social organizations say that this is a conspiracy to show the number of poor in the country
 yah baat sushant ko pasand nahin ai kyonki filmon se zyada unke personal life par focus bad gaya tha

 27 janvari 2014 ke din rahul gandhi ne jab ek privet news channel ko apana pehla tivi intervyuu diya tha tab unke intervyuu ko lekar kai sawaal uthaae gaye the
 Questions were raised on Rahul's confidence
 yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki rahul gandhi sawaal kaa jawaab sidhe-sidhe nahin de rahe the
 it was true
 rahul gandhi ke us intervyuu main aatmavishvaas kii kami dikhaai de rahi thi lekin yah badi baat thi ki rahul gandhi kareeb 80 minute ke us intervyuu ko jhel gaye
 Tried to answer every question
 jab duniya bhar ke logon kii najar kisi netaa par ho, jisamen vipaksh bhi shaamil ho to 80 minute tak sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa koi choti baat nahin thi
 The biggest thing was that at that time Lok Sabha elections were going to be held in the country, then this interview of Rahul had many meanings too
 ek galat jawaab matlab chunaav par asar ho saktaa tha
 This interview was also going to determine the political profile of Rahul
 2014 se lekar 2019 ke bich rahul gandhi ke andar bahut badlaav aayaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has given many interviews during this election
 shuukravaar ko rahul gandhi ne enditivi ke raveesh kumaar ko intervyuu diya
 The interview took place in Shujalpur in Madhya Pradesh
 intervyuu ke liye main bhi raveesh kumaar ke saath travel kar rahaa tha
 There was also a question in the mind of all of us, would Rahul Gandhi give a live interview? According to the time, Rahul Gandhi reaches Shujalpur then the program starts
 stage par kamalnath samet kai bade netaa maujuud the
 My eyes were on Rahul Gandhi, this was the first time i was watching Rahul Gandhi closely
 rahul ke haavbhaav par meri najar thi
 i was engaged in measuring Rahul Gandhi's confidence
 stage par jab congress netaa bhaashan de rahe the, tab rahul gandhi sab ko gaur se sun rahe the
 When Dewas candidate Padmashree Prahlad Tipania started singing Kabir's song on stage, Rahul Gandhi immediately got up from his chair and started recording the song
 phir is recording ko apane twitor par aplod bhi kar diya
 Many people may have found this common but when you think deeply it was a big deal
 is harakat ke saath rahul gandhi ne yah sabit kiya ki wo apane kaaryakarta kaa bhi khyaal rakhte hai
 Along with Padmashri Prahlad Tipania, the workers sitting there must also have increased respect for Rahul Gandhi
 vahaan baithe logon kaa bhi rahul gandhi ke prati pyaar badha hoga
 Rahul Gandhi stepped down from the stage after finishing his speech
 hamaara camera pehle se taiyaar tha
 On reaching the bottom, Rahul Gandhi shook hands with all the crew members, then changed the chair for the interview to the crowd i
e
 Rahul Gandhi wanted the crowd to be seen in the back ground
 rahul ne jahaan apni kursi lagaai, vahaan kaaphi dhoop thi
 We asked Rahul Gandhi, will there be any problem with the sun? Rahul Gandhi said that he has no problem with the sun
 phir intervyuu shuru hua
 We were told that Rahul Gandhi can give only 20 minutes of interview as he had to go to two more rallies after Shujalpur
 yah live intervyuu tha or rahul gandhi live intervyuu ke liye maan bhi gaye
 i myself sat there with a chair nearby because i wanted to test Rahul Gandhi's confidence as well as gesture
 mujhe unka 2014 kaa intervyuu bhi yaad aa rahaa tha
 i also felt that Rahul Gandhi should not get caught in Ravish Kumar's question
 lekin rahul gandhi ne sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab puure aatmavishvaas ke saath diya
 The questions were also tough but Rahul did not seem scared
 is intervyuu main ek baat maine gaur kii ki rahul gandhi sawaalon kaa jawaab ghuma firaakar nahin dete hai
 Perhaps they have become Sikhs handling the media
 shaayad unhen yah pataa ho gaya he ki jitna ghuma firaakar jawaab denge utana sawaal rahul ke paas gum phirakar pahonchega
 It seemed that Rahul Gandhi was speaking his heart
 sabhi jaanate hai basapa or congress ke bich uttar pradesh main gathbandhan nahin ho paaya, madhya pradesh or rajasthan main bhi baat nahin ban pai
 Mayawati is also very angry about the Congress
 jab raveesh kumaar ne mayawati ko lekar sawaal poocha to rahul gandhi ne saaf-saaf bol diya ki mayawati desh kii simbel hai
 Mayawati continues to attack the Congress, but Rahul Gandhi called Mayawati a symbol of the country
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki wo mayawati kaa sammaan karte hai, pyaar karte hai, mayawati unhen acchhee lagati he
 This statement of Rahul Gandhi was a very big statement
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki wo kabhi 'vindictive' raajnneeti nahin karenge
 Rahul Gandhi also said that he has a fight against the ideology of the RSS but if there is any injustice with the RSS or the use of violence, Rahul Gandhi will also protect it
 rahul gandhi ne kaha yah pyaar kaa desh he or pyaar se sabake dil jite ja sakate hai
 On the question of his relationship with PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi started thinking for a while then said that PM Modi has a personal hatred
 rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki wo modi se sikhte hai, unke upar jo sawaal uthaaya jaataa he us par gaur bhi karte hai or kai baar khud main kami pate hai phir us kami ko puraa karne kii koshish karte hai
 The question on the National Herald was also tough
 jab rahul gandhi se raveesh kumaar ne poocha ki bijepi kahati he neshnal herald cese main aap bel par hai, aapane bhrashtachar kiya he
 i thought Rahul Gandhi would call himself innocent, but Rahul Gandhi's answer was that PM should take action, inquire
 congress baar-baar iviem ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa rahi he
 When Rahul Gandhi was asked the question whether he would remove evms as soon as his government came, Rahul Gandhi said that it is the job of Election Commission to remove evms or not
 mujhe laga tha rahul gandhi yah jawaab denge ki unki sarkaar aane par iviem ko hataa denge
 If Rahul would have given such an answer with enthusiasm, he might have been trapped but Rahul did not do it
 1984 dangon par sam pitroda ke bayaan ko rahul gandhi ne puri tarah galat kaha
 It is also said that Pitroda should not have said that
 agar rahul gandhi yahaan pitroda ke bayaan ko sahi kehete to phir kai sawaal rahul gandhi se puche jate lekin rahul gandhi ne galat ko galat kahkar sawaal ko vahiin khatm kar diya
 Rahul Gandhi has learned how to handle the media
 jab raveesh kumaar ne poocha ki kya media bhi vipaksh kii aawaaj ko zyada spes nahin detaa he to rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'press ne vipaksh ko jitna spes dena chahie tha, utana nahin diya
 Rahul Gandhi also said that the press is not unfaithful to him
 rahul gandhi ne kaha kabhi-kabhi press zyada karata he lekin karnaa bhi chahie
 When Ravish Kumar asked Rahul Gandhi the question that people call him 'pappu' and make fun of him, doesn't he get angry? Rahul Gandhi said that he is all right, Rahul Gandhi said that he does not get angry but enjoy it
 rahul gandhi ne kaha patrkaar mere guru he
 They learn from them
 unke majaak ko gambhirtha se nahin lete
 Rahul Gandhi said that he hears where anything is said against him, he pays attention
 rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha wo sabase sikhte hai

 During the Gujarat election campaign, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is trying every tactic except for the hurt on the failures of the government
 kabhi wo mandir jate hai, to kabhi jansabhaon main janata ke bich jaakar logon se milte hai, kabhi chowk-chauraahon par chaay pite hai
 That is, they are seen adopting every possible trick of direct engagement with the public
 shuukravaar ko ahmedabad main bhi rahul kaa yahi rup najar aayaa
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi became emotional and embraced him after listening to the plight of a part-time female lecturer during a conversation with academics
 rahul ko gale lagaakar mahila kii ankhen bhi nam ho gayi
 Rahul Gandhi is on a two-day tour of Gujarat to campaign before the first phase
 is dauraan rahul gandhi ke saath skool shikshakon, praadhyaapakon, vyaakhyaataaon ko baatcheet ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 In this same lady lecturer Ranjana Awasthi also came who told her her problems to Rahul
 mahila ko diya gaya mikejab rahul ne manch se apni baat puri kar lee tab ranjana avasthi ko mike diya gaya
 He told his grief as soon as he met Mike
 ritairement ke kareeb pahunch chuki ranjana ne party kii sarkaar banane par rahul se adhyapakon ke samaksh utpann samasyaon se nipatane kii congress kii yojana ke bare main poocha
 Ranjana with a heavy heart said, 'I did my phd from Sanskrit in 1994
 us samay se ham bahut kharaab sthiti main rah rahe hai
 Despite 22 years of part-time service, our salary is only 12 thousand rupees per month
 hamen maatrutiv avkaash nahin diya jaataa he
 Ranjana Awasthi said crying in front of Rahul, 'there is no hope now
 keval ham jaanate hai ki hamane kis prakaar kaa sangharsh kiya he or kis prakaar ke dard se ham gujarey hai
 Hearing the pain of the woman, Rahul reached her
 jaise hi rahul vahaan pahunche mahila haath jodakar bhavuk ho gai
 Rahul assured them
 iske baad unhen gale lagaakar himmat bhi di
 From the stage, Rahul promised that this system would be changed after his government came

 com / wxszwa1odo agar kisi rishte main pyaar na rah jaae to uskaa hona yaa na hona koi myne nahin rakhata he
 To maintain any relationship it is very important to have love
 kai rishton main ek vakt aisa aata he jab sab kuch galat lagane lagata he
 Neither your partner nor you like seeing you and being with you
 agar aapkaa rishta bhi kisi aise mode par pahunch gaya he to iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki ab aapke sambandhon main kuch bachaa nahin he or vah sirf ek dikhaava bhar banakar rah gaya he
 If you really want to improve your relationship, then first try to understand its reasons
 aap apane prayaason se sambandh ko dobaaraa khadaa to kar sakate hai lekin use aage tak lekar janaa aapke akele kii baat nahin he
 For this both of you will need to try
 agar aapkaa partner aapkaa saath nahin degaa to aap akele dam par kuch bhi nahin kar sakate
 But the most important thing is that you know at the right time that your relationship has reached a critical point
 agar aapako bhi ye lakshan najar aa rahe hai to samaj jaaie ki aapkaa rishta khatre main he:1
 Do you feel bad about this relationship and everything related to your partner now? Do you no longer have any interest in this relationship? Do you no longer give love to the things that used to give you happiness? If you start feeling the same way then your relationship is in danger
 2
 Are you bored of everything? The things that you used to be happy with earlier, now you will find boring? Do you feel that there is something missing in your relationship? 3
 kahin aapke saath bhi to aisa nahin hota he ki ab aap jab bhi apane partner ke saath hote hai to aapako ghutan kaa ehsaas hota he? kahin aapako bhi to aisa nahin usase milakar aap apana samay barbaad kar rahe hai?agar kahin se se bhi ye baaten aapke vyavhaar main hai to yah maan len ki aapkaa rishta khatm hone kii kagaar par he

 unhone kariyar kii shuruyaat mumbai ke ek angreji dainik 'da free press jarnal' ke saath bataur cartoonist kii thi
 In the year 1960, Bal Thackeray quit his job as a cartoonist and got his political weekly newspaper Parmik
 bal thakare ke cartoon 'times of india' main har ravivaar ko chapa karte the
 This is how the Shiv Sena was formed year 1966 and the date was June 19, when the Shiv Sena was formed

 Please tell, currently Bal Thackeray's son Uddhav Thackeray is leading the party
 bal thakare ne shivasena ke gathan ke baad mukhpatr 'saamana' or hindi akhbaar 'dopaher kaa saamana' nikaala tha, jiske ve sansthaapak the
 When the 6-year ban was imposed, on 28 July 1999, Bal Thackeray was banned from voting and not contesting for 6 years on the recommendation of the Election Commission
 2005 main un par lage bain ko hataa liya gaya or unhone iske baad pehali baar 2006 main biemasi chunaav ke liye vot daalaa

 He first came near the seat and then went to Kejriwal and tried to stop him who was giving a statement on the issue

 When asked if the budget was presented in March after the end of elections in other states, including Uttar Pradesh in 2012, Jaitley said, "it is no usual practice (to be followed)"
 vah kehete hai, 'loksabhaa chunaavon se thik pehle antarim chunaav pesh kiya jaataa he

 However, Arun Jaitley says that one of the objectives of presenting the general budget first is to start spending on various items as soon as it used to start only after the monsoon months in earlier years
 unhone kaha, 'ye vaastavik kharche aadha saal biit jane kii bajaay monsoon shuru se pehle april main hi shuru ho jane chahie
 This is the main objective of this step of the Center and we are standing by it

 Anyway, the meaning of these two words is completely different

 Saddening to hear about catastrophic tragedy 
 
 # Amritsar # trainaccident The wait for the formation of an independent institution of Lokpal to investigate corruption cases is over
 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish justise pinaki chandra ghosh (pisi ghosh) desh ke pehle lokapal banane ja rahe hai
 The Lokpal law that came out of the movement against corruption passed in the last days of the UPA-2 government and paved the way for the appointment of Lokpal in the last days of the NDA government after 5 years
 lekin sanstha banane ke saath hi lokapal kii niyukti or vishwasaneeyata ko lekar sawaal bhi khadey ho gaye hai
 Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was part of the Lokpal movement, aajtak
 in se baatcheet main kaha ki sarkaar ne 5 saal tak niyukti main deree kii
 Then removed the opposition from the selection process
 prashanth bhushan rafel maamle main supreme court main yachikakarta bhi hai, is sawaal ke jawaab main ki kya wo rafel maamle kii shikaayat lokapal main darj karaayenge, prashanth bhushan ne kaha 'aise vyakti ko lokapal bana diya jisaki vishwasaneeyata pehle se hi andeh ke ghere main he
 In the case of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, he sat for months at first
 phir jayalalita ke dehanth ke baad faisla sunaaya
 Apart from this, former Justice Bhattacharya has also made very strong remarks about Justice PC Ghosh '
 lambey samay se paardarshita or javabdehi ke lekar jan andolanon kaa hissaa raheen saamaajik kaaryakarta anjali bharadwaj kaa aajtak
 Talking to in says that an independent and strong institution like Lokpal was needed for a long time to curb corruption
 tab yah tay hua tha ki swatantra vyakti ko lokapal banaaya jayega
 But in the selection of Lokpal, it was ultimately the government
 kanoon ke mutabik lokapal kaa chayan paanch sadasyeey samiti ko karnaa hota he
 In which the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Leader of the Opposition, the Chief Justice or a representative sent by him, together select an eminent legalist
 iske baad yah paanch sadasyeey samiti lokapal kaa chayan karti he
 But due to lack of sufficient strength in the Lok Sabha, the Congress was not recognized as an opposition party and Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge was called as Special Invitee in the Lok Sabha
 jis vajah se unhone baithak main aane se inkaar kar diya
 Anjali Bhardwaj says that in the absence of the opposition party, the number of panels to choose eminent legalists was reduced to 3
 jisamen pradhanmantri or loksabhaa adhyaksh ke chalate sarkaar kaa bahumat ho gaya
 This three-member panel selected former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, who is believed to be close to the current government, as a legalist
 is lihaaj se lokapal ke chayan main khadge kii anupasthiti main sarkaar kii hi chali or yah ek sarkari cameti banakar rah gai
 Anjali says that he asked about the Lokpal selection process several times through the Right to Information Act, but he was denied information
 isse saaf hota he ki chayan main paardarshita nahin barti gai
 Which is the biggest question
 isse banane se pehle hi sanstha main vishwaas ko dhakka laga he
 If the ruling BJP and Congress were to appoint Lokpal, then the CVC and CBI are already there to investigate corruption
 kanoon main lokapal ko bahut sari shaktiyaan di gai hai
 The Lokpal has the right to investigate all government officials from the PM
 lokapal ko shikaayat milane ke 30 din ke bheetar praarambhik jaanch kerani hogi
 The duration of which can be increased to 3 months
 to vahiin jaanch 6 maheene ke bheetar puri kerani hogi jise 6 maheene or badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Overall the investigation will have to be completed in 1 year
 is lihaaj se lambey samay se atake pade bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch main teji aegi
 But Anjali Bhardwaj says that this is possible when the Lokpal works properly
 centre sarkaar ne 2018 main bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium (prevention of Corruption Act) main sanshodhan ke jariye tay kiya he ki sarkaar kii anumati ke bina jaanch or poochtacha kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 In such a situation, why would the government allow investigation against itself? Anjali Bhardwaj said that he would have investigated these cases if Lokpal was there, in connection with the recent bank fraud case, Rafael deal and Sahara Birla diary
 lekin sarkaar ne pehle to 5 saal tak lokapal kii niyukti nahin kii or niyukti kii bhi to aise samay jab aam chunaavon kii adhisuchana jari ho chuki he
 When he had waited so much, when a new government had come a few months later, he would have been allowed to choose the Lokpal
 aise main jate-jate bina paardarshita barte lokapal kii niyukti karnaa ek pavitra sanstha kaa naam kharaab karnaa he

 bhartiya paristhitiyon ke anuroop viksit kiye gaye in samaadhaanon main se kai bharat ke alaava 90 se adhik aise deshon kii isi prakaar kii samasyaon ko hal karne main madad kar sakate hai jinaki aarthik or saamaajik paristhitiyaan bahut had tak bharat jaisi hi hai
 IIT has also started to understand that it needs to give more importance to humanities and social sciences in its courses
 iity-dilli manviki or saamaajik vigyaan vibhaag, is vishay par desh ke behtareen vibhaagon main se ek he
 Our institutions have also realized that it is equally important to teach our graduates all the nuances of the field of engineering as well as to establish strong social values and ethics in them
 sahanubhuti se rahit ejineering bilkul vaisaa hi he jaisaa avchetan se rahit mastishk
 Recently the program Advanced India Abhiyan (UBA), launched by the Department of Human Resources, is a good step towards encouraging our highest educational institutions to undertake research related to the challenges of rural areas
 haalanki in sansthaanon main start ap samskruti mukhya rup se snaatak ke chaatro kii koshish kaa parinaam he, hamaare ucch shikshan sansthaanon main panjikrut 25,000 shodharthiyon ko bhi udhyamita ke saath jodgaye or use aage badhaane ke liye protsaahit karnaa hoga
 Globalization: Today only one percent of the students studying at IIT are foreigners
 desh main iity kii padhai kii itani zyada maang he ki iity ne chaatro ke liye kabhi videshon kii ore dekha tak or na hi usne apni daakhila prakriya ko videshi chaatro ke anukool banane ke liye badlaav kiya
 Because of this, our students were deprived of the cultural diversity found in top universities abroad
 yah iity ke vishwa str par reating ko bhi prabhavit kar rahaa he
 Now for the first time in the last few years, two of the main entrance examinations of iit-joint Entrance Exam (JEE) and Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) have started to be conducted globally
 ye parikshaayen ab kai deshon main yojit kii ja rahi hai
 The recently launched Study in India program by the Ministry of Human Resource Development is also expected to make a big difference in cultural diversity in our campuses
 lakshya rakhaa gaya he ki har campus main kam se kam 10 pratishat chaatr videsh ke hon
 Serious efforts are being made to achieve this goal in the next few years
 mantralay dwaara haal hi main duusare deshon ke shikshakon (faikalti) ko bhi iity main mauka dene se jude mandandon ko bhi saral kiya gaya he
 IIT is keen to fill the vacancies in some faculties by foreign teachers in this way
 kahin bhi-kabhi bhi seekheh iity ne online shiksha ko bahut gambhirtha se liya he
 For example, online training through the National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) program funded by the Ministry of Human Resources and Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) has brought online training to a new high
 enpitiiel ke pathyakram jisamen iity or indian institute of science ke shikshak padhaate hai, ab utyub par bhi uplabdh hai or ise duniyabar ke logon dwaara jitna dekha ja rahaa he utana kisi or shaikshanik sanstha kii saamagree ko nahin dekha jaataa
 The Ministry-funded iit-delhi Virtual Laboratory (virtual Lab) is proving to be helpful in familiarizing students with modern laboratories in many institutes across the country
 ham us daur se guzar rahe hai jahaan shikshan-prashikshan ko rochak banaae jane kii jarurat he
 Today students who are seeking admission in our campus will be retiring from their careers around 2070
 unhen achche tareeke se padhaane ke baad bhi koi is baat kii thik-thik bhavishyavaanee nahin kar saktaa ki unka bhavishya kaisaa rahane vaala he
 a decade ago no one would have imagined that Google would be competing with Mercedes and BMW and posing a challenge to big traditional watchmakers like Apple Rolex
 jeevanaparyant seekhney kii bhaavana or apane kaushal ko hameshaa aadhuniktam rakhane kaa bhav bahut mahatvapurn hone ja rahaa he
 After strengthening their foundations by teaching our students basic things well, we also need to teach them how to be ready to learn throughout their life
 shodh va vikaas santhaanru hamaari shaikshanik sansthaaon main acchhee gunvattta vaale shodh ho rahe hai
 For example, according to the QS University Rankings, iit-delhi is ranked 28th among institutions worldwide in terms of research implications
 har saal hamaare kuch pramukh iity 400 karod ru
 The above take up sponsored research and development work
 chotii ke iity collejon main snaatak se zyada parastanak (piji) ke vidhyaarthee hai
 In the recent QS rankings, most major IIT departments are ranked among the top 100 departments in the world
 iity-dilli jaise santhaan har saal 100 se adhik patent file kar rahe hai or is tarah desh ke liye moolyawaan bauddhik sampada taiyaar ho rahi he
 However, these institutes have aimed to make their research more relevant and subject-based
 hamaare shodh or vikaas ke nattejey kaaphi ucch str ke hai lekin ham unhen vyaavhaarik dharaatal par utaarne main pichad jate hai
 Strengthening the constantly changing research culture and providing technology and products benefits to society has become very important for our institutions
 hamaare parisaron main udyogon ke saath saajhedaari karke technology park kaa nirmaan bahut ahm bhoomika nibhaayega jaisaa ki iity-madras main hua bhi he
 Many old iits are building large technology parks in their campuses
 funding ke pattern main badlaavah puraane iity collejon ko apane kaaryakalapon ke liye salanaa kareeb 1,000 karod ru
 Is needed
 is saal se sarkaar ne hair ajukeshan financing agency (echiefee) ke jariye buniyadi dhaanche ke nirmaan ke liye rin kii vyavastha kii he
 Institutions will have to repay this loan in 10 years while the government will pay its interest
 haalanki is model kii kai khubiyaan or khamiyaan bhi hai, hamaare sheersh sansthaanon ke liye ab yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki ve apni aantarik vitt ko durust karen taaki ve rin ko samay se chukaa saken
 Hence, there is a possibility that iits now accumulate more revenue through measures like continuing education programs, sponsored postgraduate programs, high value industry consultations, alumni funding initiatives, overhead fee increases on sponsored R&D etc
 The trend will begin
 desh ke ucch shikshan santhaan vyapak badlaav ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 It is expected that in the next 5-10 years, by developing technologies within the country, these institutions will not only bring big changes in public life but will also become big players of the world level
 bharat jahaan soochna praudyogiki main pehle se hi vaishvik khilaadi rahaa he, agar hamaare ucch shikshan sansthaanon main gahan takniki udhyamita kaaryakramon par paryaapt bal diya gaya to desh main takanic ke kshetra kaa agua banane kii puri sambhaavna dikhti he
 We should not underestimate the role of our high-tech institutions in this change
 in sansthaanon ko rashtranirmaan main shaamil karne or uske liye poshit karne kii jarurat he
 This responsibility is not only with the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 desh ke har mantralay, har udyog ko utkrushtataa ke apane prayaason main inhen jodpha hoga

 jabakoi videshi mehmaan bharat atahe to uski khwaahish hoti he ki wo tajmahal jarur dekhe
 If that guest is a head of government, then the residents of Tajganj around the Taj become the cause of trouble
 ye hajaaron log dinabhar ke lieek tarah se bandhak bana liejate hai
 Now US President Barack Obama is visiting India
 mehmaan navaji kii taiyaariyaan joro par hai
 But the most important is Obama's security
 jiske liye do maah se bharat or america kii suraksha agenciyaan kasarat kar rahi hai
 Apart from Delhi, Obama will go to Agra with his Begum to look after the Taj Mahal
 isliye dilli ke baad sabase zyaada suraksha ke intjaam agra main kiye ja rahe hai
 There are three circles of security for the Taj Mahal
 taj kii bahari suraksha sthaneey police kaa jimmaa he lekin andar kii suraksha siaisef ke paas he
 There are three gates to enter the Taj
 yahaan hameshaa hi kadi suraksha rahati he
 The way to get inside Tajganj is through them
 jab bhi koi shasnadhyaksh yahaan aata he, to in raaston ko subah se hi band kar diya jaataa he
 That means the resident of Tajganj is imprisoned in their area
 yadi yah viipi america yaa europe se he tab to or musiibat
 In Obama's case, the restrictions are so strict that people will not be able to go to the roof of their own house
 ab yadi is ilaake kii hotel main yadi koi paryatak rukaa he to uske liye bhi yahi pabandi lagu hogi
 Shops and showrooms of Tajganj are also planned to be closed
 tajganj ke alaava dashahraghat pracheen mandir, hazrat ahamed bukhari kii dargah, ahamed bukhari kabristaan, rajeev nagar, vasudev colony, forest colony, jaalamaa kusht ashram, gram nagala paimaa, gadhi bangaj or nagala kalphi ke aane-jane kaa rasta bhi band hi rahegaa
 There is no other alternative route to reach these areas
 aise main tajganj or aas-paas rahane vaale kareeb 15 hazaar log najarbandi jhelenge
 The people of Tajganj staged several sit-ins and demonstrations about this problem
 chunki tajmahal world heritage he, isliye maamla supreme court ke paas pahunchaa
 One of its monitoring committee sent proposals such as giving an alternative route to the district administration to the district administration or shifting the people there

 BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has given a statement about the bjp's defeat in the by-elections in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 unhone kaha ki chunaav chota ho yaa phir bada, usamen vipaksh ko khushrahmi honi chahie
 But that happy ending should not turn into a misunderstanding
 usase unka nuksaan hoga
 Naqvi said that the Samajwadi Party has won the election in association with Bahujan Samaj Party in the by-election
 unako badhai dete hai, lekin yah baat bhi samajni chahie ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main lagaataar hamane rajyon main apni sarkaar banaai he
 This has been done due to development and trust under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 nakvi ne kaha ki narendra modi ji jab desh ke pradhanmantri bane the to us samay viraasat main 22 rajyon kii sarkaar lekar nahin aae the
 Today, Bharatiya Janata Party is in government in 90 to 95 percent of the area
 unhone kaha, iskaa ek hi sandesh he ki ham sushasan par vishwaas karte hai
 Weary leaders will not be misunderstood by misunderstanding
 Fydenkavi said that we have lost both the seats of Uttar Pradesh, we believe this

 Naqvi said that why weary leaders are misunderstanding, they are not going to get any benefit

 He said that in 2014 we won elections on three things, one was about Hindutva
 doosraa bhrashtachar ko khatm karnaa or teesraa narendra modi kaa kad tha
 Swami said that a little more work needs to be done
 bhrashtachar main bahut deree kii lekin bijepi ne kaam shuru kiya he
 He said that no matter how big the opposition formed a coalition, so far no one could accuse BJP of corruption
 hindutv ke agenda par nahin rahane se hui bijepi kii harasubramanyam swami ne kaha ki bijepi ne 2014 main jab aam chunaav jite the to us samay unke paas kai mahatvapurn agenda ke jisamen hindutv kaa agenda upar tha
 At the same time, he was also moving forward on the way BJP acted on corruption
 lekin ab bijepi ko dekhnaa hoga ki unase kahaan par chook hui he or isko lekar unako samiksha bhi kerani hogi
 RJD leader Jai Prakash Yadav said that the people have taught a lesson to the egoistic BJP, the people have taught a lesson to the egoistic BJP in the by-elections in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh

 View this post on instagramthat’s what you do when cancer shows up
 You show it the way out! It is a tough phase to be in, but then i would have never known my own strength, which is inherent in each one of us, and which we come to know off when tested
 Like i said before, let’s choose to be the heroes of our own drama of life
 i strongly believe if an obstacle comes in your life it is for you to deal with it, overcome it, beat the shit out of it and become a better version of yourself, which could be a bit worn out but would be experienced, a bit tattered but more wise, a bit left out but more to bring forth, a bit handicapped but better equipped! So now the upgraded version of myself is dealing with cancer stage 1 a, which is still a result of early detection
 I’ll be going through 12 sessions of chemotherapy
 6 down, and another 6 left
 Hence the cap look nowadays😁 This post is dedicated to my journey where half the battle is won and the other half i want to fight with each of you who is enduring it
 Be resilient, be strong, we shall overcome and how! Also i have immense gratitude for people around me who have taken it in the right spirit and did not give up on me
 Personally i owe it to my best friend @komal20to77 husband @ayushmannk parents @kashyap6480 @yajankashyap 
 This bit is taken for granted but when professionally you are supported and still look dependable your resilience to fight becomes stronger
 For this i owe it to @atulkasbekar @tanuj
 garg @findingshanti @ shrutiv11 who were too shocked when they heard the news but didn't give up and still lay bet on this bruised but not broken horse
