 So both of them hatched a conspiracy that the entire city of Surat will never forget
 yahaan padhein:amir banane kii chahat ne ek air hostess ko banaaya gangsterbedroom main mili thi dishit kii lashsajeesh aisi thi ki log khud kaatil se hamadardi jataa rahe the
 But only until the whole truth of this conspiracy and planning is revealed
 or yah sach saamne aayaa chah jhooth se
 Before that, let us tell you what happened
 28 june 2016, din mangalvaar
 Parle Point, the posh area of surat city
 yahaan maujuud ek aaleeshaan ghar main subah se matam kaa maahaul tha
 The reason was the murder of well-known textile businessman Dishit Zariwala
 dishit kaa qatl der raat unke ghar main hua tha
 At that time only three people were present in the house
 dishit uski patni velsi or dedh saal kii beti
 Inside the house, all the belongings were scattered in the bedroom where the murder took place
 pehali najar me dekh kar yahi lag rahaa tha ki ghar main lutpaat hui he
 This is the false story of Welsey, the only eyewitness to save the story of that night
 uskaa ro-ro kar bura haal tha
 But the police had to investigate
 lihaaja police ne velsi se kisi tarah poochtacha kii
 During interrogation, Welsey said that on the night of June 27, the three had gone to a relative's house for dinner
 vahaan se kareeb saadhe nau baje lautakar ghar aae
 Then came to his bedroom on the upper floor
 lekin us rose dishit neeche parking aria kii lite of karnaa bhul gaye the
 So it went down again to turn off the light of the guided parking area
 lekin jab kaafii der baad bhi dishit upar bedroom main nahin lautaa, to usne awaz lagaai
 Dishit then replies that he is coming up
 lekin iske kuch der baad usne jo kuch dekha, wo bada daraavna tha
 Welsey told that the three masked robbers brought a knife to Dishit's neck and brought him upstairs, and before coming he locked him and his daughter in the bathroom
 magar bathroom main band karne se pehle wo uske pahane jevar bhi lut kar le gaye
 After a long time, he felt that the robbers had left the house, then he broke the mirror of the bathroom and then made a noise
 shor sun kar padosi aa gaye
 Only after that he came to know that Dishit has been killed
 tafteesh ke dauraan shaq ke ghere main ai velsiis bayaan ke baad police ke paas velsi par shaq karne kii koi vajah nahin thi
 But when the police proceeded to investigate, a strange thing came to know
 pataa chalaa ki velsi ke saas-sasur to pehle se videsh gaye hue the
 But on the night of the murder, all the other relatives of Welsey or Dishit were also out of Surat
 ab sawaal yah tha ki yah jaankaree luteron ko kaise mili? is sawaal kaa jawaab talashne ke liye police phir se dishit ke ghar kii talaashi lene pahunchi
 During the search, several such things suddenly came to the fore, which brought Welsey into the dock of suspicion
 Must Read:jail ke baahar sirkati laash phenkane vaale kaatil kii kahanipakada gaya velsi kaa jhuthpulice ne jab velsi ke ek-ek bayaan kii padtaal kii to andaja hua ki aisi chah baaten hai jo velsi ne jhooth kahin
 Welsey said that at the time of the incident, Ditit had gone off the lights of the parking area below
 jabaki ghar kii talaashi lene par pataa chalaa ki parking aria kii lite kaa ek switch upree manzil par bedroom main bhi he
 Welsey had said that the robbers had forcefully entered the house by placing a knife on the neck of Dishit
 or dishit ko chaaku kii nok par upar lekar aae the
 When he had to be killed, he could even hit Dishit down
 velsi ne kaha tha ki lutere ghar se keemtee saamaan or yahaan tak ki uske jevar bhi lut kar le gaye
 If the motive of the killers was looting, then why did they leave the hard gold ring in the hand of the person whom they killed? Welsey said the robbers also scrambled with Dishit
 dishit chashma pahentaa tha
 But his glasses did not fall anywhere
 velsi ne luteron kii taadaad teen bataai thi
 While only two people were seen in the CCTV camera of the house
 yahaan tak ki sisitivi camere main vaardaat kaa vakt or velsi kaa bataaya vakt bhi mail nahin kha rahaa tha
 The murder of crores for the wealth of crores of rulers, these six lies overturned all police investigations
 isi ke baad velsi se sakhti se poochtacha karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 And the decision brought color
 velsi agar apane aashiq se shaadi hi karnaa chaahati thi to wo bina dishit kaa katl kiye bhi aisa kar sakati thi
 But Welsey was at a disadvantage in doing so
 kyonki phir use pati dishit kii karodon kii daulat se haath dhonaa padataa
 And he also wanted wealth with Aashiq
 velsi kaa ikbaal-e-jurmavelsi ne apana jurm kabool karte hue police ko bataaya ki vah suketu naam ke ek shaks se pyaar karti thi
 But both of them got married in different places
 iske baavjood suketu or velsi milte rahe or shaadi kaa faisla kar liya
 Instead of being separated from Dishit, Welsey planned to remove him from the road, because this would make Welsey entitled to millions of direct property
 katl ke liye usne 27 june kii raat isliye chuni kyonki saas-sasur ke alaava saare kareebi rishtedaar us roj shahar se baahar the
 As part of the plan, Welsey deliberately left the door open for Suketu and his driver to enter
 donon nakaab, renkot, chaaku, mirchi powder or duusari chizon ke saath ghar main ghuse or unhone ghuste hi bistar par so rahe dishit ko maar daalaa
 When the two were killing Dishit, Welsey was standing there in the bedroom watching her husband be killed
 iske baad puure maamle ko lutpaat dikhaane ke liye velsi ne hi suketu ko apane zevar de die or ghar kaa sara bikher diya
 But she forgot to remove Dishit's gold ring, ring and purse
 velsi or uskaa premi suketu giraftaarailhal velsi or uskaa aashiq suketu police kii hiraasat main hai
 By the way, if anyone has suffered the most from this incident, then she is her one and half year old baby girl
 jiske baap ko maa ne maar daalaa or maa ab jail main rahegi
 That is, the shadow of both mother and father has risen from the head of this girl

 ham aapako bataaenge kaise aap maa durga kii vishesh puja karke aashirwad praapt kar sakate hai
 The importance of Navratri signifies the new ahoratras with the word Navaratri, Navratri is worshiped in the new forms of Shakti, the word night signifies accomplishment
 upasna or siddhiyon ke liye din se adhik ratriyon ko mahatv diya jaataa he
 Hence, most of the festivals are celebrated only in the nights
 raatri main manaae jane vaale parvon main deepawali, holikadahan, dashahra shivaratri auranvaratriate hai
 Nine days of Navaratri should be used to worship, worship and get spiritual power of Goddess Durga
 kaise hui sharadiya navaratri kii shuruyaat, 10wein din kyon manaate hai dashahranavaratri menkaisa bhojan karennavratri menhalka, shuddh or satvik bhojan sab ko karnaa chahie
 Because it is the time of season change, light food is good for health
 vahiin jo log vrath rakhte hai wo fal or vrath vaale padaarth prasad ke rup main grahan karen
 Do not forget these mistakes in Navratri, you become a mother, why do you do Narajanavratri in the night? In the Indian tradition, a peaceful environment is considered necessary for meditation, worship and spiritual contemplation, there is peace in the night, there are many obstacles both natural and physical
 Calm down at night

 pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad se buree tarah ghire pakistan ne jaish-e-mohammad sargana masood ajahar ke khilaaf nirnaayak karrwai karne kaa sanket diya he
 a senior security officer has revealed this
 unhone bataaya ki pakistan ne sabhi aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa mood bana liya he
 Earlier, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi claimed that after the handing over of the dossier of Pulwama attack by India, the main positions of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed have been taken over by the Government of Pakistan
 da tribune akhbaar ne pakistan ke suraksha adhikari ke hawaale se yah bhi daawa kiya ki pakistan ne pulavama aatanki hamale se pehle hi aatank ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa man bana liya tha
 However, it is not yet clear what kind of action Pakistan will take against Masood Azhar and other terrorists

 It may withdraw its opposition to the inclusion of Masood Azhar in the UN Security Council's list of global terrorists

 The Pakistani official also claimed that Pakistan has also investigated the Pulwama terror attack, but no evidence of Pakistani terrorists being found in it was found
 unhone daawa kiya ki pakistani netritv ne faisla kiya tha ki agar pulavama aatanki hamale main kisi ke shaamil hone kii baat saamne aati he, to uske khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 The Pakistani official also said that there is no evidence of any Pakistani terrorist organization being involved in the dossier India has given to Pakistan in the Pulwama terror attack
 agar dekha jaae, to pakistan har masale par jhooth bolta aa rahaa he
 Isolated on the international stage, Pakistan is now trying to change its image of terror
 aapako bataa den ki 14 farvari ko jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par aatmghaatee hamalaa hua tha, jisamen 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After this, India entered into action in Balakot, Pakistan and destroyed the terrorist bases of jaish-e-mohammed
 isamen masood ajahar kaa saalaa yusuf ajahar bhi maaraa gaya tha
 Buoyed by this action of the Indian Air Force, Pakistan tried to launch an airstrike on India's military bases, which was thwarted
 bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan epa-16 ko maar giraaya tha
 In this air fight, the Indian Air Force fighter aircraft mig-21 also fell victim and its pilot wing commander Abhinandan Vardhaman flew into the occupied territory of Pakistan
 haalanki bharat ke dabaav ke baad pakistan ne abhinandan ko chhod diya tha
 During this time Pakistan also tried to negotiate a deal with India, but India did not agree

 match khatm hone ke kareeb do ghante baad watsape par aae badhai sandeshon se unhen apni shandaar uplabdhi kaa pataa chalaa

 Only the women's ODI record was known

 maine hameshaa hi sachin tendulkar ko dekha he or mujhe unke tathaa saurav ganguli ke bich 250 ranon ke aas-paas hui saajhedaari ke bare main jaankaree thi
 When i and Deepti reached 300 runs for the first wicket partnership, i knew that we had broken the record of 268 runs by Sarah Taylor and Carolyn Atkins of England
 hamen to match ke baad watsape se jaankaree mili
 19-year-old Deepti, who wanted to score as many runs in the powerplay, said, "when we came out to bat, our goal was to get as many runs in the powerplay

 chunaavon main ek nayaa chalan shuru hua he
 Nota yani nan of da abav (upar die gaye main se koi nahin) kaa
 a separate NOTA button has been installed at the bottom of the electronic voting machine
 jo matadaata kisi bhi ummidavaar ko vot nahin dena chaahate hai, wo ye batan dabaa sakate hai
 This vote has no effect on the election results
 yani agar kisi chunaav main nota ko sabase zyaada vot mil bhi jaaen to nota ko nahin, balki duusare number par aae ummidavaar ko vijayi ghoshit kiya jayega
 They are also not counted in the formula for the forfeiture of the candidates' bail
 to sawaal ye he ki koi matadaata apane ghar se chilchilaati dhoop main nikal kar matdaan centre par ghanton lambii line main lagane ke baad nota ko vot dekar kyon aayega? lekin kai log aisa kar rahe hai
 In the recent assembly elections, the NOTA button was used for the first time
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or dilli ke saadhe gyaarah karod matadaataaon main se 15 lakh ne nota kaa batan dabaaya
 That means only one and a half percent of the voters
 ye koi bahut badi sankhya nahin he
 But it is believed that many voters angry with Congress in Delhi hit the NOTA button and damaged it
 isi tarah chhattisgarh ke maovadi prabhavit ilaakon main logon ne badi sankhya main nota kaa batan dabaa kar raajnneetik partiyon ke prati apana avishvaas vyakt kiya
 Most of the people who press the NOTA button are those who have lost faith in the existing political system
 congress ho yaa bijepi yaa phir anya koi pramukh kshetreey raajnneetik dal, ye log inhen apana samarthan nahin dena chaahate
 In Chhattisgarh, a large number of NOTA vote shows in Maoist-affected areas
 dilli main agar aam aadmi party maidan main nahin hoti, to shaayad yahaan nota ko zyaada vot mili hote
 That is, those angry with Congress and BJP who wanted to press the NOTA button, they thought it better to vote for broom instead
 to kya aam aadmi party ek aise madhyam ke rup main ubhar rahi he jiske jariye log apana gussa nikaal sakate hai? ‘sab chor hai’, ye kehane vaale kai log samaaj main hai
 Those who are angry with the system do not hesitate to go from home to polling stations and press a button that will not do anything
 nakaaratmak matdaan desh yaa samaaj ko sahi disha nahin de saktaa
 Nota is a sign of this
 kai logon ke liye nota ko vot dena aam aadmi party ko vot dene jaisaa hi gaya he
 So that nothing is going to change, but your anger towards the system can be expressed

 The monsoon session, which began on July 21, has so far been an uproar
 ek din bhi kaam nahin ho sakaa
 The government says that it is ready for debate on every issue and the opposition is not ready for any discussion without resignations and in such a case the same happens everyday in the House, which Dr
 kalam nahin chaahate the
 Everyday in the House is what Dr
 kalam kii peshaani par pareshaani kii lakeeren khinch detaa tha
 And the same is happening everyday in the House for which Dr
 kalam kaa man baichaiyn tha
 In such a situation the mps of the country have to understand that if Dr
 abdul kalam ko agar sachhee shradhanjali deni he to sirf phool chadhaane or kuch der ke maun se aage badhate hue sadan kii kaarywahi ko sucharu rup se chalaanaa hoga
 Dr
 kalam sari zindagi bina kisi dikhaave ke karm main vishwaas karte rahe, isliye unhen di jane vaali shradhanjali main bhi dikhaava kam or karm kii bhoomika zyada ho to shaayad wo unhen sachhee shradhanjali hogi
 If the proceedings of the House go smoothly, it will probably be the biggest tribute to them from the mps
 aise main desh ke saansadon ko samajhnaa hoga ki agar dow
 If the true tribute is to be paid to Abdul Kalam, then the house will have to run smoothly, by offering flowers and going ahead with some silence

 input IANS se Cancer is a dangerous disease that causes cells of any part of the body to divide uncontrollably
 cancer sharir ke ek hisse se duusare hisson main failata he
 First of all, cancer occurring in any part of the body is called primary tumor
 jiske baad sharir ke duusare hisson main hone vaala tumor metastatic yaa secondary cancer kehalaata he
 What is metastatic cancer? Metastatic cancer cells are also similar to primary cancer
 metastatic cancer shabd kaa istemaal solid yani thos tumor ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo sharir ke anya hisson main fail chukaa hota he
 Know - How good is it to sleep in the afternoon? These are the 4 main stages of cancer - In the first and second stages, the tumor of the cancer is small and does not spread to the depth of the surrounding tissues
 - teesri avasthaa main cancer viksit ho chukaa hota he
 The tumor is enlarged and its chances of spreading to other organs increases
 - chauthi avasthaa cancer kii aakhri avasthaa hoti he
 In this, the cancer spreads from its initial part to other organs
 ise viksit yaa metastatic cancer kaha jaataa he
 How does cancer spread? - Cancer spreads in the body in three ways
 diarect ekstansion yaa invejan, jisamen primary tumor aas-paas ke angon or tishyus main failata he
 For example prostate cancer reaches the bladder
 - lymphatic system main cancer kii koshikaayen primary tumor se tut kar sharir ke duusare angon tak chali jaati hai
 The lymphatic system is a group of tissues and organs that store and store cells to fight infections and diseases
 - cancer khun se bhi failata he
 This is called hematogenous spread, in which cancer cells break down from the primary tumor into the blood and reach other parts of the body with blood
 diabetes se blad pressure tak, basi roti khaane se hote hai kai phydeye hai cancer ke lakshancancer ke aam lakshan hai vajan main kami, bukhaar, bhukh main kami, haddiyon main dard, khaansee yaa moonh se khun aana
 If any person sees these symptoms, they should immediately contact the doctor
 bharat main cancer ke aam prakaarbharat main sabase zyada munh, stan, cervical, fefdon or prostate kaa cancer dekhne ko miltaa he
 Of which 60 percent cases are of oral, breast and uterine cancer
 haalanki inkaa nidaan aasaan he, lekin puraa ilaaj sirf shuruaati avasthaa main hi sambhav he
 Let us tell you, the highest number of deaths are due to oral cancer in India, the main reason is smoking and tobacco

 With a 1 per cent vote share, a record 400 seats were won on their own
 us vakt bijepi kii sthapana ko mahaj chaar saal hue the or use 7
 It got 4 percent votes
 lekin ab halaat ekadam juda hai
 BJP has become the largest party in the world today and under Narendra Modi's leadership it is winning the election continuously
 modi brands kaa jaadu bhi chunavi raajnneeti main sir chadhakar bol rahaa he or yahi vajah he ki maujuuda chunaav main jahaan puraa vipaksh lamaband hokar narendra modi ko satta se ukhaadne kii har mumkin koshish karata dikhaai diya, modi ne puure vipaksh ko dharaashai kar diya he
 With this, the BJP under Modi's leadership has also broken Rajiv Gandhi's 35-year-old record
 cricket khilne vaale hamen behad pasand aate hai, achche khilaadi or zyada
 But the players who have learned to win life by turning the thorns of the road into flowers even outside the field, they not only like, but also inspire us
 aise hi khilaadiyon par ek nazar
 Bhagwat Chandrasekhar 'chandu' country: India: Poliosal 1971, Oval ground, Test against England, a wizard's witchcraft and our victory

 Fellow bowler Bishan Singh Bedi dubbed him as 'god'! Yuvraj Singh: India: Kaktarjik, who was winning the match for the team at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, was going crazy
 lekin kisi ko bhi unke dard kaa ahsaas nahin tha
 He was battling cancer and the initial treatment broke him down
 lekin yuvi ne haar nahin maani
 He returned to international cricket and inspired thousands and millions
 wo ek over main 6 chakke maarane kaa vaada bhi kar rahe hai
 Martin Guptillad: New Zealand: Not having toes, Martin Guptill, one of the world's most dangerous openers, has seen bad speech in his childhood
 wo ek aise haadase kaa shikaar hue, jisamen jaan bhi ja sakati thi
 Due to this accident, Kiwi batsman had to bite his left toe and two fingers, which caused anxiety about his running and running
 lekin unhone vaapasi kii, cricket main jagah banaai or aaj bhi sabase tej raftaar khilaadiyon main jane jate hai
 Shoaib Akhtaradesh: Pakistan often misses the ball at a speed of 100 miles per hour as soon as the elbow is hit and the flat Pararawalpindi Express is mentioned
 lekin unka sharir bhi kisi ajoobe se kam nahin
 His elbow is bent up to 40 degrees, while he usually turns only 20 degrees
 iske alaava unke pair sapaat the or 5 saal kii umr tak wo sidhe chal bhi nahin sakate the
 But he showed the fastest bowler by removing all the troubles

 This is the reason why he had to stay away from cricket for repeated treatment, often had to play with injections
 lekin unhone haar nahin maani
 Defeated the disease and saw a long successful career
 iske alaava unhen 2005 main skin cancer bhi ho gaya tha
 But he also battled it out by constantly putting on a hat and wearing protective gear under the jersey

 He was certain to return after treatment, but not whether he would see great form again
 lekin unhone saare sawaalon kaa jawaab apane balle se diya
 After returning, the highest score of Test cricket was 400 not out, which no one could break till date
 mansoor ali khan pataudideshh bharatdikkatahek aankh kii roshni janaapane kariyar ke zyaadaatar hisse main tiger pataudi ek aankh se khele
 He lost one eye light in a car accident

 Michael Arthur: England: Formerly the former captain of Ankylosing Spondylitis England played not only the front team, but also his body cell
 unhen ek aisi beemaari thi, jisamen sharir kaa immune system apane hi cell par hamalaa karne lagata he
 This usually caused severe pain in his spine and back muscles
 lekin arthton ne is dard ko haraaya, test or vanade match main captaini kii, salaami ballebaazi kii or kai match jitaaye
 Jonty Rhodes: South Africa: Jonti Rhodes, arguably the most prolific fielder of Mirgidunia, had no match for the art of catching the ball or the ability to runout
 unhen dekhakar yaqiin nahin hota tha ki maidan par fielding karne vaala insaan he, mashin nahin
 But these players also fought well with epilepsy in life
 miragi hone ke baavjood unhone ise kariyar main aade nahin aane diya or jeet darj kii
 These days he teaches fielding tricks to different teams all over the world
 saujany:newsflicks Panagariya India and China had rated each other the most favored nation in bilateral trade relations in 1984, but bilateral trade between the two countries was modest 2 in 2000 after 16 years
 9 arab dollar ke str par pahunch sakaa
 But as the growth rate in India rose to the 8-9% mark and industrial tariffs were reduced, mutual trade increased by four times a day to $ 74 billion by 2011
 aise main aam taur par yahi khyaal aata he ki is tarakkee se china or bharat, donon desh apni janata kii bharpoor vaahvahee batorenge
 but it's not like that
 bharat ke sarkari halkon or press kii surkhiyon main bas yahi rat lagi he ki is rishte main kahin kuch to gadabad he
 India exports two to three times as much as India exports to China
 yah aam avadharana he ki china apane yahaan taiyaar chizon ko bade paimaane par khapaane ke liye bharat ke teji se badhate bazaar kaa istemaal kar rahaa he jisase bharat ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 As a matter of opinion, 154 anti-dumping cases filed against China in 1995 by India came to light, which is the largest number of cases ever taken by one member against another in the World Trade Organization
 kya yah najariya uchit vishleshan par aadhaarit he? bilkul nahin
 From the beginning, the US is seeking five times more goods from China than India and its bilateral trade deficit is 10 times more than India
 phir bhi 1995 se ab tak china ke khilaaf anti damping maamalon ko uthaane ke lihaaj se 112 kii sankhya ke saath america duusare number par he
 The lesson of economics is that you should always take care of your current account balance
 macroiconomic nazariye se dekhen to sevaaon ke badale maal kaa niryaat yaa aayaat ke liye remitance (paisa bhejnaa) main kuch bhi khaas nahin he
 For macroeconomic stability, it is more important that the total current account balance is maintained for a long time and not with each particular trading partner
 agar bharat ko apane saamaan or sevaaon ke liye america or europe main zyada keemat mil rahi he to use vahaan ke bazaaron ke liye niryaat karnaa chahie
 And if he is getting the cheapest of the goods and services he needs, then he should buy from there
 darasal, china se aayaat ko simit karne se kul chaalu khate ke ghate kaa hal nikaalane main koi khaas madad nahin milane vaali
 This will mean that they will turn to more expensive suppliers which will affect our purchasing power and real income
 jab tak desh main ho rahe videshi nivesh or bahari vanijyik udhari (eksternal commercial borowing) ke rup main badi maatra main shuddh puunji aa rahi he, usee aakaar ke chaalu khaataa ghate se nahin bachaa ja saktaa
 a common complaint has been that India's trade relations with China reflect a colonial pattern: it imports goods made in China, but exports the raw materials for it
 yah nishchit rup se chintaa kii baat he kyonki bharat tulanaatmak rup se phaayde kii is sthiti kaa istemaal nahin kar sakaa, lekin yah ek tarah se desh ke andar paidaa hui samasya he
 China is facing a severe labor shortage and increasing wage pressures, while India has a large population of workers in the informal sector, which can be assembled in the organized sector without increasing their wages to produce quality products that work hard
 To give the Chinese goods a thumbs up
 lekin hamaare kathor shram-kanoonon ne hamaare haath baandh die hai or hamen china ke sangathit kshetra main taiyaar utpaadon ko kharidne ke alaava koi chaara nahin sujhata jinhen vah betahasha niryaat kar rahaa he
 The extent is that now Chinese clothes are also being marketed
 aaj, china bharat ke niryaat kii banisbat 10 guna zyada kapade niryaat karata he
 It is a matter of regret that India's total clothing exports have slipped sharply from 12 per cent in 1993-94 to 5 per cent in 2011-12
 bharat ko china se sabase badi shikaayat yah he ki usne bhartiya dawaaiyon or software utpaadon ke niryaat main adchane paidaa kin
 This is a legitimate complaint and in order to have better access to the Chinese market, the Prime Minister of India should emphasize the same during the Chinese Prime Minister's visit to India

 Narendra Modi fulfilled one of his election promises today
 modi ne uttar pradesh kii har raily main kaha tha, 'sabakaa saaf karo'
 SP to B, b to b and Congress to A
 modi kii lahar or unke senapati amit shah kaa kahar
 The three BSP, Congress and SP became clear from UP
 batch gaye to bas congress kaa gandhi parivaar or sapa kaa yadav parivaar
 Apart from these, everyone loses and loses badly
 rajya kii do ahm partiyaan mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party or choudhary ajit singh kii rashtriya lokdal to khaataa bhi nahin khol pai
 This is the first time in the history of the BSP, when it went to the polls and stuck to zero
 or jin choudhary charan singh kii viraasat sanbhaalane kaa kya mulaayam kya ajit singh, sabhi daawa karte hai, unheen ke putr kii party bhi loksabhaa se gaayab ho gai
 It is clear that after this record breaking victory, the BJP will be eyeing the assembly elections, which it is away from power for 12 years
 raibareli ne rakhaa bahu kaa maanautar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton ke liye hue chunaav main bijepi or uski sahyogi apana dal ne 73 siton par jeet darj kii
 Two seats came from the Congress - Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli and her son Rahul Gandhi from Amethi
 sonia kii jeet to phir bhi saral rahi
 He defeated Ajay Agarwal of BJP by 3 lakh 53 thousand votes
 yahaan ke chunaav ko lekar bijepi zyada papad bhi nahin bel rahi thi
 At the last moment, the lawyer sent him a ticket
 modi ne yahaan raily bhi nahin kii
 Talking about Rahul Gandhi's lost sweat, Amethi seat, the Congress prince Rahul Gandhi's sweat was lost
 jis amethi ko gandhi parivaar apni bapauti samajhataa tha, vahaan is baar rahul kii bahan priyanka ko camp karnaa padaa
 Critics even say that Priyanka Gandhi has won from Amethi, not Rahul
 aankadon kii baat karen, to rahul gandhi 79 hajaar voton se chunaav jite hai
 But the reality is that after a long time after the announcement of the BJP, the BJP introduced Smriti Irani, an important soldier of the Modi Army
 kam samay main hi smriti ne joardaar campaning kii
 Modi's rally at the last moment brought him into the competition
 pehali baar bijepi ko yahaan se jabardast samarthan mila
 Smriti got 2 lakh 19 thousand votes
 yahaan se surkhiyaan batorne vaale aam aadmi party ke kumaar vishwaas kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 Apart from these two seats, the Congress was seen in only a few places
 masalan, modi ke khilaaf jaharila bayaan dene vaale imran masood saharanpur main kuch round main aage rahe or kul milakar duusare number par rahe
 Raj Babbar also remained at number two to say
 magar vah general wike singh se saadhe paanch lakh voton se pichde

 samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav, jinke bete akhilesh uttar pradesh kii satta par kabiz hai bataur mukhyamantri
 Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh had a dream to win so many seats from UP in these elections that if a third front name is formed then the leader can become PM on the strength of numbers
 magar sapana tutaa hi nahin taar-taar ho gaya
 The ruling SP in UP won only where Mulayam or his family were contesting
 bahu dimple yadav pichhali baar kannauj se nirvirodh jiti thim
 This time gasping won by 22 thousand
 khud mulaayam mainpuri se to aasaani se 3 lakh 65 hajaar se chunaav jeet gaye
 But he lost his sweat in Azamgarh
 aakhri charan main hue is chunaav main mulaayam ko bachaane ke liye puri sapa sarkaar camp kar gai
 Yet Ramakant Yadav of BJP and Shah Alam alias Guddu Jamali of BSP gave him a tough fight
 netaa ji aakhri aakhri tak pralobhan or vaadon ke sahare tike rahe or phir 66 hajaar se chunaav jite
 Clearly, according to the leader of his stature, this score is very minor
 sapa ko jo do or siten milin, vah bhi parivaar ke hi do logon ke paas gayi
 Akshay Yadav, son of Mulayam's cousin Ram Gopal Yadav from Firozabad, was making his debut in politics
 unke liye arase se sapa sarkaar taiyaari kar rahi thi
 The BJP also made allegations of large scale fake voting here
 akshay yadav lagbhag 1 lakh 65 hajaar voton se chunaav jite
 Another nephew of Mulayam, Dharmendra Yadav won the elections with 1 lakh 60 thousand votes from Badaun seat

 Now a new expression has been added to their political dictionary: if they cannot defeat the enemy, then steal their weapons
 bhoomika badalane ke dilachasp maamle main, do dhur virodhiyon ne ek-duusare kaa chola odhane ke vikalp ko chunaa he
 Nitish is not known for his love for appearances or shayari, but last week he surprised people by making footy on the lines of Jai Ho
 jab agle din lalu ne bhi shairana andaaj main iskaa jawaab diya to nitish ne doosraa kavitaai prahaar kiya
 On this Lalu did something different: he became serious
 uksaane ke bhav ko darkinar karte hue unhone bade hi thandepan se jawaab diya, ''ham gambhir kism kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 We will not allow time to fade
 ab samay bihar ke vikaas kii disha main kaam karne kaa he
 "in the unpredictable world of Bihar politics, many myths have been broken and many new molds have been created
" yah zyada puraani baat nahin he, jab lalu naaron ke badshaah hua karte the or apni baton ke tiron se nishaanaa saadhaa karte the or nitish dhairya tathaa eemaandaaree kii murat hua karte the
 Today, while Lalu has become serious, this seriousness is, of course, artificial, while Nitish has been resorting to satire like tightening
 dost se dushman bane in donon diggajon ne apane chehre badal liye hai
 Perhaps a pressing fear has emerged on the occasion of elections, which has forced both of them to play each other's role
 aisa lagata he, lalu ne nitish kii dheer-gambhir charitrik visheshtaon ko aatmsaat kar liya he, jabaki bihar ke mukhyamantri ne aatmavishvaas se labarej dikhne ke liye tuchh baton or thitholi kaa sahaara liya he
 Due to a lot of stakes in this election, both the leaders are seen to be showing great faith in each other's success story
 rajya main vidhansabha chunaav 21 aktubar se chah charnon main hone hai
 These are considered to be the most important elections in the last two decades
 in chunaavon main jahaan nitish or lalu kaa bolbalaa he to duusari ore congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi kii vishwasaneeyata bhi daanv par lagi hui he
 He has to prove that his success story in Uttar Pradesh is not short-lived or short
 ateet main apane sabhi raajnneetik pratidwandviyon ko tikhe parihaas se aahat karne vaale lalu ko puri tarah gambhirtha ke rang main duube dekhnaa vaaki hairat bharaa he
 Of course his sharp satire made him a subject of debate but he knows that his image has to be paid for it
 aaj lalu kaa raajnneetik vyakaran puri tarah badal chukaa haih yah aacharan or saamagree main bahut hi sanyamit he
 Far from being ridiculed, it seems that these days, who are being told from their worst days, are giving speeches that are at their best and closer to reality
 asaamaanya rup se shant, ve sabaki baat kar rahe hai, jisamen savarna bhi shaamil hai, jinhen rajd ke 15 saal ke shashan main sirf upeksha ke sivaay kuch or hasil nahin hua tha
 His ideas also seem to have acquired seriousness, as his identity has always been associated with lightness and eloquence
 ek samay aisa bhi thi jab ve parvaah nahin karte the lekin aaj jab unhen sidhi chotii par chadhaai kerani he to unhen cheharaa badalane kii sakht darkaar thi taaki unke vichaaron ko majaak bhar na samaj jaae
 And Nitish's style of behavior was probably the best option for him
 duusari ore, aalochak nitish par prachaar abhiyaan main halkaapan laane or hamalon ko nijee rang dene ke aarope laga rahe hai, vahiin nitish is sabase beparwaah najar aa rahe hai or puri dilari se inkaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Not only this, there was a time in the past when cheeky comments were considered to be Lalu's copyright, but this time "people are dyeing their hair to hide their age" as jumle has come from Nitish
 shuru main lalu ne pratikriya kii lekin ab ve aisa nahin kar rahe
 Of course Nitish will not agree with this, but it seems that the color of the RJD chief has come to dominate him after seeing Lalu as helpless for so many years
 isamen koi tajjub nahin ki nitish lalu ko raajnneetik rup se ek se zyada jatke de chuke hai, lekin aaj jab ve apane kariyar ke sabase bade chunaav kaa saamana karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri apane dhur virdohi jaisaa banane kii sakht jarurat mahasoos kar rahe hon
 Meanwhile, Lalu is not responding to any sharp blows and is facing them with great patience, and all this exercise has taken away the agony since the year of November 2005, when RJD was forced out of power
 Have to do
 aakhir kyon is chunaav kii ghadi main netaa un chehron ko odhana chaahate hai jinako ve raajnneetik rup se dafnaanaa chaahate hai? yahaan unka ek-duusare ko naapsand karnaa myne nahin rakhata he
 Everyone is trying to adopt something that used to be with someone else and not with him
 lalu ke paas lagata tha, vah sab kuch he jo nitish ke paas nahin tha jaise-mauka padane par vyangy, hazirajvaabi, sajag mastishk or sthaniyata kaa rang
 On the other hand, Nitish had everything that would force the other to think about him that he is a very thoughtful leader
 unki chhavi chaaturya or jod-tod, vinamrata or vakpatutaa, or in sabase upar vishleshan ke kaushal se las ek gambhir netaa kii he
 Can the two different characteristics given above be in one person, if it happens then it will prove to be a deadly package
 aaj, lalu ko nitish kii pahchaan kii sakht darkaar he, kyonki aaj jab ve bihar par ek baar phir apana daawa thonkane ja rahe hai to aise main unhen yah bakhubi pataa he ki apni jaden dobaaraa jamaane kii ranneeti kaa mukhya bindu nitish kii chhavi se udhaar lenaa jaruri he
 At the same time, Nitish has no break with Lalu's enthusiasm
 aaj ve is baat se bhi bhaleebhanti rou-ba-rou hai ki loksabhaa chunaav main rajg ko bihar kii 40 main se 32 siten dilaane vaale ''nitish factor'' kaa rang feekaa pad chukaa he
 Perhaps they want to leave their personal mark on the election with fierce courage like Lalu
 lagata he, unki ranneeti 2005 ke samay main waapas pahunch gai he jab unka hamalaa lalu ke ''jangal raaj'' par tha
 And they are not consciously declaring their achievements which are only a handful
 chunaav hameshaa se muddon par lade jate rahe hai, lekin pichley do dashakon se bihar main chunaav vyakti kendrit hokar rah gaye hai
 The bitterness between the two people who have been friends before has completely dissolved and there is no way out of the treaty
 sambhaavna yahi he ki aane vaali ladaai ko dekhte hue shaayad ek shaks khud ko duusare ke rang main rang daale taaki vah apane bheetar maujuud khaamiyon ko kuch had tak dur kar sake
 Soon, women's dummies will not be seen in the launch and small clothes in front of the Garments store in the markets of Mumbai
 mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale yon shoshan ke maddenjar brihanmumbai municipal korporation yani ki biemasi ne ek prastaav ko manjuuri di he jisamen mumbai main mahilaon ke semi neude putalon ko dukaanon yaa saarvajanik jagahon par lagane par pabandi lagane kii maang kii gai he
 Beamac says that in view of the increasing sexual violence on women, it has become necessary to ban these dummies
 biemasi kaa tark he ki undergarments ko jis tarah in damies ke jariye shop ke maalik baahar pradarshit kar bechate hai, vah bahut apmanjanak he
 The General Body of BMC, a 227 corporator, has demanded from BMC Commissioner Sitaram Kunta that banning such dummies outside shops should be banned
 ghatkoper se bijepi kii korporator ritu tavade ne 26 april ko yah prastaav pesh kiya tha, jise 16 may ko biemasi kii general body ne manjuuri de di
 This new rule will come into effect in Mumbai after the approval of the Municipal Commissioner
 desh main balaatkaar kii vaardaaton ke maamle main mumbai duusare number par aata he
 In such a situation, corporator Ritu Tawde says that women's semi-nude clothes outside pornographic shops spread vulgarity and this leads to men committing 'wrongdoing'
 tavade kaa kahana he, 'tu pis vaali damies logon ko mahilaon par yon hinsa ke liye uksaati hai
 What do these dummies need to display semi nude in this way? Everyone should think that women passing through the market are ashamed to see them

 "40-year-old Eicher Singh, son of computer science teacher Muktsar Tarlochan at Bhattiwala's government high school and property dealer Bhindranwale in Jalandhar, is a representative of the fast-growing fundamentalist who is searching for his heroes among the waving militants of Klanishnikov

 The Dal Khalsa, a separatist and militant organization between 1982 and 1994, celebrated the construction of the Bhindranwale memorial a day earlier on 5 June

 Emotions are still on the rise
 dal khalsa ke 45 varshiya mahasachiv kanvarpal singh kehete hai, ''memorial kaa nirmaan sant bhindranvaale ke aadarshon ko hasil karne kii disha main badi uplabdhi he
 Kanwarpal Singh used to be a terrorist before
 unhone khalistaani nayak ko sikhon ke maanas main ek rajnatik or dharmik shakhsiyat ke rup main baitaane main apane jivan ke 14 saal jhonk die
 The ban on Dal Khalsa was lifted on 6 August 1998 and it began to function as an open organization for the purpose of establishing Khalistan
 ise britain, america, canada aadi main baithe khalistaan samarthakon se khub dhan aata he jiskaa istemaal yah dushprachaar ko anjaam dene ke liye karata he
 Kanwarpal says, "we adopted everything we could think possible
 '' unhen aisa kehete is baat kaa bilkul bhi andaja nahin ki khalistaan kaa zikr bhar bhi das saal peeche ke daur ke nateezon ko saamne laa saktaa he
 Sitting in the air-conditioned room at Freedom House, the headquarters of Dal Khalsa, next to the Amritsar railway station, says Kunwarpal, "we have used everything from seminars, stickers with Bhindranwale's photographs, T-shirts, to create the consciousness of the common people of Punjab May the memory of Bhindranwale be settled
 ''apni chaati thonkkar khud ko dilasa dene vaale punjab ke netaaon kii naak ke neeche sab kuch hota rahaa or unhone isaki tab tak khabar nahin lee, jab tak ki yah aagaamee nikaay chunaavon ke chalate rajnatik baadhyataa nahin ban gaya
 On June 7, the Union Home Ministry sent a letter to Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal advising them to take action against the fundamentalist elements who built the memorial
 udhar, chandigarh main baithe punjab congress ke mukhiya amarinder singh ne prastaav kii ninda karte hue kaha ki isse ''logon main bhay laut aayega or sampradayik vibhaajan paidaa ho jayega
 The BJP, a partner of the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal, taunted that the memorial should not be built and every effort should be made to avoid it
 mana jaataa he ki punjab main sarkaar up-mukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal hi chalaate hai, is maamle par unki pratikriya kuch saaf nahin rahi he
 He completely overshadowed the work of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and was completely evaded by reporters on 6 June in Ludhiana and Jalandhar
 shiromani akali dal kaa puraa netritv amritsar ke swarna mandir main aatankwaad ko hawa dene vaali ghatnaon se kanni katata najar aayaa
 Laxmi Kanta Chawla, the flamboyant BJP leader from Amritsar and former Health Minister, says, "this cannot be done without the consent of the Punjab government
" aap ek aise rajya main or kya ummid kar sakate hai jahaan mukhyamantri, unka betaa or bahu ek aatanki ke liye kshamaa yachana maangane chale jate hai?'' unka ishaara rajoana kii faansee kii sajaa ke maamle main prakaash singh badal dwaara faansee kii tay taarikh 31 march se pehle raashtrapati pratibha patil ko di gai dayaa yachika kii ore tha, jiske baad faansee tal gai
 It is believed that Chawla says what is right, and because of this, he has to face opposition from his party colleagues many times
 puraane amritsar ke tunda talab ilaake ke apane do kamare vaale ghar main baithi chawla thodi pareshaan hai
 She sees Bhindranwale's honor as a conspiracy to revive the Khalistani movement
 ve kahati hai, ''koi bhi smarak banane se pehle is desh ko yah tay karnaa hoga ki uske shahid koun hai
 After all, how can a destroyer responsible for the death of thousands of people be called a martyr? ”the patron of the Damdami mint, once headed by Bhindranwale, at Chowk Mehta, 30 km north of Amritsar, sees things from another perspective
 vivaadaaspad smarak ke nirmaan ke liye jimmedaar taksaal pramukh 44 varshiya baba harnaam singh khalsa kehete hai, ''yaadgaar (smarak) un logon ko samarpit he jinhone harmandir sahib kii raksha main apni jaan di
 "significantly, the hardline Damdami Mintal won the 2011 SGPC election by helping the Shiromani Akali Dal
" bhindranvaale smarak ko akali dal kii mook sahmati isi kaa nateeja maani ja rahi he
 Pleased to pave the way for honoring his pioneer, Harnam Singh insists that the protest coming from within the BJP and the Congress, not the memorial, can dissolve communal poison in the Punjab air
 ve kehete hai, ''in logon ko ek vishuddh dharmik kaary par raajnneeti karnaa band kar dena chahie
 Keeping this opposition in mind, they want to complete the work before the construction period of 18 months
 18 maheene kaa samay esajipisi dwaara niyukt kiye gaye vaastukaron ne nirdhaarit kiya he

 They should be taken lightly
 '' unke mutabik, bhindranvaale kaa smarak esajipisi ke liye paise ikattha karne kaa ek or saadhan maatr he
 Gill believes that any governmental or political reaction would be to repeat the mistake made in 1984
 chowk mehta main bhindranvaale ko 20 sitambar, 1981 ko giraftaar karne ke liye bheje gaye gil yaad karte hue kehete hai ki ''vah rajya or centre sarkaar dwaara baari bhul thi'' jisane bhindranvaale kaa myth khadaa karne main madad kii
 However, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Iqbal Singh, who took voluntary retirement in January this year, believes that Punjab is slowly moving towards an era of violence
 philhal, punjab main 200 se zyada bhagode aatanki hai jo alag-alag aatanki gatividhiyon main vaanchit hai
 "when the violence first erupted in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the number is four times higher than that time," he says
 ''is baar maamla khatarnaak isliye ho saktaa he kyonki kattarpanthi takatein ''dilli or amritsar ke bich teji se tuutate bharose ko bhaanp rahi hai

 "the people of Punjab should hope that this is not the silence before the storm
" jammu-kashmir ke baraamula main buudhvaar ko surakshabalon or aatankwaadiyon ke bich muthbhed ho gai he jisamen ek aatanki maaraa gaya
 Terrorists were reported to be hiding in Sopore on Wednesday morning

 The security forces were conducting door-to-door search operations when the terrorists started firing on them

 The CAG report tabled in Parliament on Thursday said that the Ministry of Defense's oversight mechanism for offset was ineffective as it was formed without a clear definition of role and objectives
 yah keval kagaji karrwai rah gayi
 The CAG pulled up the Ministry of Defense to allow the selection of offset partners not eligible for offset contracts
 report main kaha gaya ki mantralay ne bharat ke vishisht udyog main videshi companiyon dwaara pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) ke jariye ofaset patibaddhtaon ko puraa karne kii anumati di lekin paardarshita kaa abhaav rahaa or yah bhi nahin tay hua ki kis tarah ke videshi nivesh kii anumati hogi
 The report said that Boeing's proposal to set up a test unit in DRDO (defense Research and Development Organization) was an investment in commodities even though it was not an eligible offset

 This black helmet kept on the table in Delhi's Preet Vihar police station had plagued the police for several months
 is kaale rang ke helmet kii talash main dilli police kii kai team maheenon se sadakon kii khaak chaan rahi thim
 Due to this helmet, bikers were also being checked by blocking blockade of Delhi for the past one month
 aakhirkaar, kadi mehnat ke baad kaale rang kaa ye helmet ab police ke haath lag hi gaya
 What's so special in this helmet is that many questions will also be arising in your mind regarding this helmet
 aap soch rahe honge ki is helmet main aisa kya baat he ki puri dilli police isaki talash main juty thi
 Actually, this simple-looking black helmet had become a big weapon of extortion meaning extortion for a particular gang
 jiske target par dilli kii sadakon or red lits par tainaat trephic police karmi hote the
 According to Hoshpulis, the black helmet has a spy camera fitted
 ye gang sadakon par tainaat trephic pulicekarmiyon ko jabaran rishwat kii peshkash karata tha or jaise hi koi inke jaal main fansata, helmet main lage khufia camere main kaid ho jaataa
 After this, the game of extortion from the policemen started
 police ke anusaar kai baar ye gang trephic police karmiyon ko chaalaan ke paise lete camere main kaid karata or phir use apane tareeke se edit kar pulicekarmiyon ko ugaahi ke liye dhamkata tha
 How the police caught the gang of fake journalists
 
 
 pichley kai maheenon se dilli trephic police kii taraf se is gang kii shikaayatein aa rahi thim, jiske baad is gang par najar rakhni shuru kii gai
 This gang's way of tricking the Delhi Traffic Police into its trap was also unique
 pehle ye gang bike par spai camere vaale is helmet ko lagata phir kisi red lite kaa signal todta, jaise hi vahaan maujuud police karmi unhen pakadta, ye apana khel shuru kar dete the
 On Tuesday night also, 2 henchmen of this gag were trying to trap traffic policemen posted in Ranjit and Shahrukh Preet Vihar area
 lekin pulisavaalon ko in par shaq ho gaya
 As soon as they were questioned in custody, this game of forced extortion was exposed
 dilli police ne farji patrakaron ke is gang se 1 helmet, 2 spai camere, badi sankhya main batan camere or kuch visiting cards baraamad kiye hai
 Police are now looking for the absconding members of the gang, but also the black letter of their crime
 tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita ne apni nikat sahyogi shashikala natarajan ko apni party ediemke se nikaal diya he
 No reason has been given for this unprecedented step
 shashikala lambey samay se jayalalita kii sahyogi rahi hai or vah unke saath hi rahati hai
 Jayalalithaa was one of the main accused in the case of allegedly acquiring illegal assets of more than Rs 66 crore during 1991-96 as Chief Minister
 maamle kii sunwaayee ko nishpaksh rakhane ke liye bengaluru kii adaalat main sunwaayee karai ja rahi he
 Jaya objected to the court sending summons to him, but the Supreme Court had directed him to appear in the court himself to answer the questions
 in peshiyon main chennai se vishesh vimaan main savaar hokar shashikala bhi jayalalita ke saath gai thim
 The 12 people who have been expelled from the AIADMK include Jayalalithaa's step-son and Sasikala's nephew VN Sudhakaran, whose marriage to Tamil superstar Shivaji Ganesan's granddaughter in 1996 also became a big controversy for Jayalalithaa
 nirbhaya maamle main faansee kii sazaa behaal hui he
 The trial court, the High Court and the Supreme Court have upheld the death sentence from beginning to end
 is maamle ne bharat main balaatkaar ke prati kanoonee prakriyaaon or najariye ko hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 The lawyers of the accused had objected that all the accused have been sentenced to collective punishment
 aparaadh main sabaki alag-alag bhoomika or unki saamaajik, aarthik, manovaigyanik prishthmubhi ke hisaab se sazaa tay nahin hui
 This is called mitigating factor in English
 yani sabko faansee sunai gai, jabaki kisi ko umr kaid to kisi ko das saal kii sazaa ho sakati thi
 The Supreme Court rejected these objections, saying that when we make a comparison between the provoking situation and the role of the accused and their socioeconomic circumstances with full vigilance and caution, we are forced to come to this sole conclusion
 That the aggravating circumstances outweigh the other circumstances available on record
 isliye ham is nattejey par pahunchate hai or faansee dene ke hai court ke faisle ko sahi pate hai
 There is no reason to have a different opinion from this decision
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, bhav he
 The three-judge bench has given the verdict after a year's hearing
 teenon jajon ne sahmati se faisla diya or jab faisla sunaaya to court main tali baji
 The reporters covering the court were surprised
 ham aaj prime time main faisle par hi focus karenge, bahes main hissaa lene waalon ko bhi 429 pej ke faisle ko padhane kaa vakt chahie isliye ham aaj unke saath bahes nahin karenge
 We also have not been able to read the entire decision but believe that some parts of it should be put before you
 nirbhaya ke mata pita ne kaha he ki unhen insaaf mila he
 They were demanding execution from the beginning, and the execution of the sentence has been restored till the end
 ham sab to ek hi shabd jaanate hai ki insaaf mila, ho saktaa he is maa baap ke paas bhi hamaare liye yahi shabd ho ki insaaf mil gaya, lekin sochiye ki 16 disambar ke baad se wo din main kitni baar us haadase se guzarate honge
 In their response, a responsible citizen has faith in the constitution and legal process which is keeping them alive
 unhen ladane kii himmat detaa rahaa
 Nirbhaya's mother's name is Asha
 saaleha kii maa kaa naam aashaa nahin he, bilkis he, agar bilkis ke paas bhi yahi aashaa nahin hoti to 17 saal tak adaalat kaa aasraa nahin dekhati
 The Bombay High Court has not disappointed this mother either
 ham bilkis ke hisse ko bhi isamen shaamil karenge lekin pehle justise deepak mishra or justise ashok bhushan ke faisle ke us hisse ko padhate hai jisamen samuhik chetana kaa prasang aayaa he
 Judge Sahiban writes that the desire for sex, a hunger for violence, a state of vigor and a distorted nature have shaken the collective consciousness which does not know what to do
 yah zaahir he ki lanpat ichha, mukt kaam ichchhaaon kii gulaami or jaanwaron jaisi ghinauni chaah kii daastaa apilkartaaon ko gunaah kii taraf le gai jisane samuhik chetana main sadame kii tsunami laa di or parivesh ke sabhy taane bane ko puri tarah dhwast kar diya
 It is not a literal translation
 justise mishra kii angrezi he bhi acchhee or nafis
 Therefore, there may be some mistake
 magar jajment ke sirf is hisse par bhartiya samaaj kii kunthaon par lambii bahes chhid sakati he
 We want to say something while keeping ourselves limited to the collective consciousness
 ek baat dhyaan rakhiyegaa, faisla samuhik chetana ke aadhaar yaa uske liye nahin liya gaya he
 Understanding this will have to reduce the importance of the decision but there is a mention and many people may misunderstand it, so i want to bring the context of Bilkis Ban
 4 may ko bombai hai court ne gujarat dangon se jude bilkis baanon cese main ek faisla sunaaya
 In this case, 12 people were sentenced to life imprisonment, besides five police officers and two doctors were also found guilty of erasing evidence
 yani aam janata ke saath-saath state yani rajya ke sadsy bhi bilkis baanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa main shaamil the
 The Bombay High Court upheld the cbi's plea in the case
 19 saal se bilkis baanon apane insaaf kii ladaai lard rahi he lekin kya bilkis ke saath koi samuhik chetana he
 That is why it is important to review a word like collective consciousness
 kya samuhik chetana is baat se vichlit hui ki 19 saal kii bilkis ke saath balaatkaar tab hua jab vah garbhvatee thi
 Was the collective consciousness disturbed when her child was snatched from her and beheaded on a stone
 kya samuhik chetana us samay jaagi jab bilkis kii maa or bahan ke saath rape kiya gaya
 Did collective consciousness hit the streets when Bilkis' daughter and 14 of her family were killed
 bilkis ne yah nahin kaha ki faansee se kam par maanenge phir bhi saaleha kii maa bilkis or nirbhaya kii maa aashaa ji kii pratikriyaayein kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 Bilkis has cautioned that we should not lose our senses in the name of religions
 usne The people of India have thanked the people of Gujarat
 bahut se log soch rahe honge ki bilkis ke saath jo hua wo godhra ke baad kii samuhik chetana thi
 Ask the Sikh brothers what was the collective consciousness of 84 in the streets of Delhi
 isliye samuhik chetana se satark rahanaa chahie
 Not every collective consciousness is good
 ek saal tak sunne ke baad justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata main teen jajon kii bench ne faisla diya he
 The accused were given full opportunity to present their case
 sarsari taur par padhate hue laga ki justise mishra ne kaaphi saavdhaanee or satarkta se faisla likhaa he
 Many states have given examples of decisions taken in such cases
 rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, upi, jammu kashmir, andhra pradesh, madhyapradesh ke maamalon kaa zikr faisle main sandarbh ke taur par dikhaa
 It is true that the girls who reached Raisina Hills were not just crowded
 inhen bheed kahkar khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many of the girls in this crowd had left home for the first time in their lives for an issue
 wo bheed banakar kisi ko maarane nahin ai thim balki samvidhan or kanoon ko jagaa rahi thim
 It would be a mistake to reject the crowd of girls who came to Raisina in the name of collective consciousness
 is bheed kii tulana aap us bheed se nahin kar sakate jo bulandshahr main gulam mohammad ko hindu ladki se prem karne ke aarope main maar detii he, jo alvar main gau raksha ke naam par pahalu khan ko maar detii he
 The banners held in the hands of the girls gathered on Raisina, they were dreaming of a better and constitutional society
 yah faisla aitihaasik he
 This incident was really terrible
 itani bhayanak ki aaj bhi uske prasangon kaa zikr karte hue siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 Justice Mishra begins his decision in this way
 
 
 
 The chilly evening of 16 December 2012 in Delhi, along with her partner in the PVR Select City, would not have given the 23-year-old girl any inkling that in the next few hours, a booming night would bring a terrible darkness to her life
 Is supposed to jab wo muniraka bas stand se apane dost ke saath bas main savaar hogi
 She would not have imagined that she was going to fall prey to the lust of a gang of six people, she would be subjected to a murderous attack, it would become a source of fun for them and her personal organs would be severed, for a hunger Nobody would have thought about that
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, magar jaj sahiban ne jis tarah se likhnaa shuru kiya he, faisle ke pehle do teen paragraph se hi man baari ho jaataa he
 Is not read
 aaropee chaahate the ki faansee kii sazaa ho rahi he to har pahalu par thik se sunwaayee ho jaae
 The Supreme Court gave him full opportunity
 aropiyon ke vakil kaa sawaal tha ki exiaar main deree hui
 Meaning the evidence has been tampered with but this is not always true
 exiaar main deree ke sawaal par hi lambii bahes chali he
 If you read the verdict, this debate is going on for at least seventy pages
 court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki deree par shaq karnaa kai vajahon par nirbhar karata he
 However long delays can also be forgiven if the victim does not have motive to implicate the accused
 is cese main peediton ko 11:05 par aspataal main bharti karaayaa gaya
 The statement of the victim boy was recorded at 3:45
 shuruyaat main praathamikta peediton ko medical sahaayta dene kii hoti he
 Even if it is to be delayed, it is absolutely human
 ek doosraa sawaal tha ki exiaar or medico legal cese main aropiyon ke naam darj nahin the to court ne kaha ki exiaar koi encychlopedia nahin hoti he
 The victim is not expected to give complete information about the incident in the FIR itself
 is tarah se ek ek sawaal par sunwaayee hui he
 Like the delay in the FIR, there was a long debate on dyeing declaration as well, but the court said in its judgment that we have no right to believe that any gesture would have been recorded by gesture, gesture Yes, it can be recognized as evidence
 basharte bayaan darj karte vakt puri saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 On the basis of the evidence available on our records, there is a kind of consistency in all the three dyeing declarations i
e
 all three are quite similar, and they are also matched with other evidence
 isliye trial court, hoicourt ne sazaa dene main daaing dicleration ko jo aadhaar mana he, wo sahi he
 Translation of judgment is a difficult task
 phir bhi tamaam bahes se zyada yah faisla hamen sakshar karegaa kyonki jajon ne tamaam pahaluon par gaharaai se likhaa he
 Many may feel that this decision is going to promote the decisions of hanging, so it is too early to think
 balki 402 number pej par justise mishra or justise bhushan likhte hai ki yah cese reerest of rer he yaa nahin, bharat main faansee kii sazaa kii prakriya kai nitigat sudhaaron or nyaayik faislon ke kaaran ab kaaphi viksit ho chuki he, isse pataa chalata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar alag-alag samay main hamaara kya nazariyaa rahaa he, beshak sazaa dene main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa paksh aage rahata he or bharat kaa antarrashtriya daayitv bhi jhalkata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar adaalaton kaa nazariyaa badla he
 In India, the death penalty shutter is moving towards closure, but in the case of rarest of rare, a small window is open
 agar sahi anuwaad hua he to yah hissaa bataata he ki adaalat faansee kii sazaa kii andh samarthak nahin he
 She is growing in this direction based on all the evidence and arguments
 choti si jo khidki khuli hui he uskaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, it is also a judgment that the verdict be read
 is faisle main justise aar bhaanumati kii tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he
 She writes, in the words of the great scholar Vivekananda, the best thermometer of the progress of any nation is what it treats women
 auraton ke kilaaf aparaadh se na sirf unka swabhimaan aahat hota he balki samaaj ke vikaas kii gati bhi ruk jaati he
 i hope that this heinous incident in the capital and the death of a young girl will lead to a mass movement that will end violence against women
 'tippaniyan Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Yeats are usually quoted in the judgment of the judges, seen long after that Vivekananda has been quoted
 ye thik he
 This fight against rape is long
 nirbhaya maamle kaa samuhik chetana aksar un maamalon main khamosh rah jaataa he jo dilli se dur samaaj ke kamazor tabake ko apana shikaar bana rahaa hota he
 In the case of rape of women such as Bilkis Ban and hundreds of unnamed Dalit girls, the day when the women of India reach Raisina, the fight for women will become women
 kade kanoon or sakht sazaa se aparaadh par kya asar padataa he
 If not, six cases of rape would not have been filed in Delhi every day
 rashtriya aparaadh ricard beuro ke anusaar 2013 main balaatkaar ke 33,707 maamle darj hue
 In 2014, there were 36,735 rape cases reported
 2015 main balaatkaar ke 34,651 maamle darj hue
 This entire matter has been covered with great responsibility by our colleague Ashish Bhargava
 ashish un samvaadadaataaon yaa ankaron jitne kismatwale nahin hai jinka photo hording par lagata he magar is samvaadadaata kii har report news main hamen kuch na kuch sikhaa jaati he
 Ashish said that the bench of three judges was a special bench
 is bench ke baithne kaa bhi ek kaayda hota he
 The head of the bench, Justice Deepak Mishra, sits in the middle
 unki daayin ore unase junior justise aar bhaanumati baithi thim
 To the left of Justice Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan was seated, who is the most junior of these three
 is bench ne ek saal tak somvaar, shuukravaar or shanivaar ko sunwaayee kii he
 There are more than 44 hearings
 balki mitegating factor vaale maamle main to 6 march se dobaaraa hearing hui yani jis sawaal ko lekar yah maamla supreme court pahunchaa tha us sawaal par ek saal main do baar sunwaayee hui
 The judges showed no haste
 insaaf kaa palada baari lage isliye aropiyon ke vakeelon kii madad ke liye supreme court ne do bade vakil bhi upabaldh karaaye
 Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde
 in donon ne dilli police kii jaanch or dilli hoicourt ke faisle par khub sawaal kiye
 That means every question got a chance
 final faisle main dilli police kii jaanch kii saraahna kii gai he
 Verbatim is not translation, it is emotion
 teen jajon kii bench ne ek saal kii sunwaayee ke baad faisla diya he
 The three judges gave the verdict with consent and clapped in court when the verdict was delivered
 court cover karne vaale samvaadadaataaon ko thodi hairaani hui
 We will focus on the decision in prime time today, those who participate in the debate also need time to read the 429 page decision, so we will not debate with them today
 ham bhi puraa faisla nahin pard sake hai lekin maanate hai ki iske kuch hisson ko aapke saamne rakhana chahie
 Nirbhaya's parents have said that they have got justice
 wo shuru se faansee kii maang kar rahe the, or faansee kii sazaa ant ant tak behaal rahi he
 We all know only one word that justice was received, maybe this parent also has the same word for us that justice has been received, but imagine how many times a day they will be going through that incident from 16th December onwards
 unki pratikriya main ek zimmedaar naagarik kaa samvidhan or kanoonee prakriya main vishwaas hi to he jo har haal main unhen zindaa rakhe hue he
 He kept giving them courage to fight
 nirbhaya kii maa kaa naam aashaa he
 Saleha's mother's name is not Asha, Bilkis, if Bilkis did not have the same hope, she would not have seen the courtroom for 17 years
 bombai hai court ne is maa ko bhi niraash nahin kiya he
 We will also cover the part of Bilkis but first read the part of the judgment of Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan which has brought about the subject of collective consciousness
 jaj sahiban likhte hai ki sex kii chaah, hinsa kii bhukh, taaqatvar hone kii sthiti or vikrut vruti, ne samuhik chetana ko hilaa diya jo nahin jaanata ki kya karnaa he
 It is evident that the lustful desire, the slavery of free work desires and the slavery of animal-like abusive desire led the appellants to crime which brought a tsunami of shock to the collective consciousness and completely destroyed the civilized fabric of the surroundings
 ye shabdash: anuwaad nahin he
 Justice Mishra's English is also good and Nafees
 isliye kuch galati ho sakati he
 But only this part of the Judgment can spark a long debate on the frustrations of Indian society
 ham sirf samuhik chetana tak hi khud ko simit rakhte hue kuch kahana chaahate hai
 Keep in mind one thing, the decision has not been taken on the basis of or for collective consciousness
 aisa samajhnaa faisle ke mahatv ko kam karnaa hoga magar zikr he or kai log ise galat samaj sakate hai isliye yahaan bilkis baanon kaa prasang laana chahta hum
 On May 4, the Bombay High Court delivered a verdict in the Bilkis Ban case related to the Gujarat riots
 is maamle main 12 logon ko umr kaid kii sazaa sunai gai, iske alaava paanch police afasar or do doctor bhi sabooton ko mitaane ke maamle main doshi paae gaye
 That is, the general public as well as members of the state were also involved in the violence against the Bilkis Ban
 bombai hai court ne is maamle main sibiai kii daleel ko sahi mana
 For 19 years, Bilkis Ban has been fighting for his justice, but is there any collective consciousness with Bilkis
 isiilie samuhik chetana jaise shabd kii samiksha zaruri he
 Did the collective consciousness distract that 19-year-old Bilkis was raped when she was pregnant
 kya samuhik chetana vichlit hui jab uski bacchee ko usase chhina gaya or ek pathar par sir patakar kar maar diya gaya
 Did collective consciousness awaken when Bilkis was raped along with his mother and sister
 kya samuhik chetana us vakt sadakon par utari thi jab bilkis kii beti or uske parivaar ke 14 log maar diye gaye the
 Bilkis did not say that he would agree on being hanged, yet the reactions of Saleha's mother Bilkis and Nirbhaya's mother Asha ji are quite significant
 bilkis ne saavdhaan kiya he ki ham dharmon ke naam par is tarah apane hosh na ganvaa baithen
 He bharatvasiyon gujaratvaasiyon ko shukriya kaha he
 Many people may be thinking that what happened to Bilkis was the collective consciousness after Godhra
 aap sikh bhaaiyon se puuchhiye 84 kii dilli main sadakon par koun si samuhik chetana thi
 Therefore, one should be alert from collective consciousness
 har samuhik chetana acchhee nahin hoti he
 After hearing for a year, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra has given the verdict
 abhiyukton ko puraa mauka diya gaya apana paksh rakhane kaa
 a cursory reading showed that Justice Mishra had written the verdict very carefully and cautiously
 kai rajyon main is tarah ke maamalon main jo faisle hue hai, unka udhaaharan diya he
 The cases of Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, UP, Jammu Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh were mentioned in the judgment as a reference
 yah baat thik he ki raisina hills par pahunchi ladkiyaan sirf bheed nahin thim
 They cannot be dismissed as a crowd
 is bheed main bahut si ladkiyaan apane jivan main pehali baar kisi mudde ke liye ghar se nikali thim
 She did not come as a mob to kill anyone but was awakening the Constitution and the law
 samuhik chetana ke naam par raisina par ain ladakiyon kii bheed ko riject karnaa galati hogi
 You cannot compare this mob to the mob that kills Ghulam Mohammad in Bulandshahr on the charge of loving a Hindu girl, who kills Kishor Khan in the name of cow protection in Alwar
 raisina par jamaa hui ladakiyon ke haath main jo binar the, wo behatar or sanvaidhanik samaaj ke sapane dekh rahe the
 This decision is historic
 yah ghatana vaaki bhayanak thi
 So terrible that even today, while referring to his episodes, shuddering arises
 justise mishra ne apane faisle kii shuruuaat is tarah se karte hai
 
 
 
 16 disambar 2012 kii dilli kii sard bhari shaam ne apane saathi ke saath piviar salect city main film dekhne gai 23 saal kii ladki ko zaraa bhi bhanak nahin di hogi ki agle kuch ghanton main, tej hoti kanpakapaahat bhari raat uski zindagi main ek bhayanak andhera laane vaali he
 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand
 usne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki wo chah logon ke gang kii havas kaa shikaar hone ja rahi he, usapar jaanaleva hamalaa hoga, wo unke liye mouj masti kaa zariyaa ban jaaegi or nijee angon ko chhin bhinn kar diya jayega, ek aisi bhukh ke liye jiske bare main kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 Literally not a translation, but the way Judge Sahiban started writing, the first two to three paragraphs of the verdict get heavy
 padhaa nahin jaataa he
 The accused wanted that if the execution of the sentence is being done, then every aspect should be properly heard
 supreme court ne unhen puraa mauka diya
 The counsel for the accused was concerned that the FIR was delayed
 matlab saboot ke saath chhedchhad hui he lekin hameshaa yah baat sahi nahin hoti he
 There has been a long debate on the question of delay in the FIR
 faisle kaa padhenge to kam se kam sattar pannon tak yahi bahes chal rahi he
 The court has written in its judgment that doubting the delay depends on several reasons
 haalanki lambii deree bhi maaf kii ja sakati he agar peedit ke paas motive nahin he abhiyukt ko fansaane kaa
 In this case, the victims were admitted to the hospital at 11:05 pm
 3:45 par peedit ladke kaa bayaan record kiya gaya
 Initially the priority is to provide medical assistance to the victims
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki deree hui to ye bilkul maanviya he
 Another question was that the names of the accused in the FIR and Medico legal case were not registered, then the court said that the FIR is not an encyclopedia
 peedit se ummid nahin kii jaati ki wo ghatana kii puri jaankaree exiaar main hi de
 In this way, one question has been heard
 epa ai aar main deree kii tarah daaing diclaration ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa, is par bhi lambii bahes chali he magar court ne apane faisle main kaha ki hamen yah maanane main koi dikkt nahin he ki haav-bhav, ishaare se koi daaing dicleration darj hota he, use sakshya ke taur par manyata di ja sakati he
 Provided that due care has been taken while recording the statement
 hamaare record par jo sakshya uplabdh hai uske aadhaar par sabhi teenon daaing dicleration main ek tarah kii nirantarata dikhti he yani teenon main kaaphi mail he, or anya saakshyon ke saath unka milan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the trial court, the High Court has considered the basis of Dyeing Declaration in sentencing
 faisle kaa anuwaad ek mushkil kaam he
 Nevertheless, this decision will make us more literate than all the debate because the judges have written deeply on all aspects
 bahuton ko lag saktaa he ki yah faisla faansee ke faislon ko badhaava dene vaala he to aisa sochna jaldbaazi hogi
 Rather, on the 402 number page, Justice Mishra and Justice Bhushan write that whether the case is the rarest of rare or not, the process of execution in India has developed a lot due to many policy reforms and judicial decisions, it shows that hanging What has been our view at different times about the punishment, of course, the possibilities of improvement in punishment are ahead and India's international responsibility is also reflected Persons sentenced to death has changed the attitude of the courts
 bharat main faansee kii sazaa kaa shater band hone kii taraf bad rahaa he lekin reerest of rer maamle main ek choti si khidki khuli hui he
 If the correct translation is done, this part shows that the court is not blind to the execution of the sentence
 wo is disha main tamaam sabooton or tarkon ke aadhaar par bad rahi he
 Used a small window that is open
 isliye ek insaaf yah bhi he ki faisle ko padhaa jaae
 Justice r Bhanumathi's comment is also important in this judgment
 wo likhti hai, mahaan vidwaan vivekanand ke shabdon main kisi bhi raashtra kii pragati kaa sabase acha tharmametre yah he ki vah auraton ke saath kya saluk karata he
 Crime against women not only hurts their self-esteem but also stops the development of society
 main ummid karti hum ki rajdhani main hui is jaghanya ghatana or ek noujvaan ladki kii maut se ek janandolan ubharegaa jo ek mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ko khatm karegaa
 Comments aamtaur par jajon ke faisle main shakespeare, vardsaworth, yeats ko hi kot kiya jaataa he, bahut dinon baad dekha ki vivekanand ko kot kiya gaya he
 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 nirbhaya ke mata pita ne kaha he ki unhen insaaf mila he
 They were demanding execution from the beginning, and the execution of the sentence has been restored till the end
 ham sab to ek hi shabd jaanate hai ki insaaf mila, ho saktaa he is maa baap ke paas bhi hamaare liye yahi shabd ho ki insaaf mil gaya, lekin sochiye ki 16 disambar ke baad se wo din main kitni baar us haadase se guzarate honge
 In their response, a responsible citizen has faith in the constitution and legal process which is keeping them alive
 unhen ladane kii himmat detaa rahaa
 Nirbhaya's mother's name is Asha
 saaleha kii maa kaa naam aashaa nahin he, bilkis he, agar bilkis ke paas bhi yahi aashaa nahin hoti to 17 saal tak adaalat kaa aasraa nahin dekhati
 The Bombay High Court has not disappointed this mother either
 ham bilkis ke hisse ko bhi isamen shaamil karenge lekin pehle justise deepak mishra or justise ashok bhushan ke faisle ke us hisse ko padhate hai jisamen samuhik chetana kaa prasang aayaa he
 Judge Sahiban writes that the desire for sex, a hunger for violence, a state of vigor and a distorted nature have shaken the collective consciousness which does not know what to do
 yah zaahir he ki lanpat ichha, mukt kaam ichchhaaon kii gulaami or jaanwaron jaisi ghinauni chaah kii daastaa apilkartaaon ko gunaah kii taraf le gai jisane samuhik chetana main sadame kii tsunami laa di or parivesh ke sabhy taane bane ko puri tarah dhwast kar diya
 It is not a literal translation
 justise mishra kii angrezi he bhi acchhee or nafis
 Therefore, there may be some mistake
 magar jajment ke sirf is hisse par bhartiya samaaj kii kunthaon par lambii bahes chhid sakati he
 We want to say something while keeping ourselves limited to the collective consciousness
 ek baat dhyaan rakhiyegaa, faisla samuhik chetana ke aadhaar yaa uske liye nahin liya gaya he
 Understanding this will have to reduce the importance of the decision but there is a mention and many people may misunderstand it, so i want to bring the context of Bilkis Ban
 4 may ko bombai hai court ne gujarat dangon se jude bilkis baanon cese main ek faisla sunaaya
 In this case, 12 people were sentenced to life imprisonment, besides five police officers and two doctors were also found guilty of erasing evidence
 yani aam janata ke saath-saath state yani rajya ke sadsy bhi bilkis baanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa main shaamil the
 The Bombay High Court upheld the cbi's plea in the case
 19 saal se bilkis baanon apane insaaf kii ladaai lard rahi he lekin kya bilkis ke saath koi samuhik chetana he
 That is why it is important to review a word like collective consciousness
 kya samuhik chetana is baat se vichlit hui ki 19 saal kii bilkis ke saath balaatkaar tab hua jab vah garbhvatee thi
 Was the collective consciousness disturbed when her child was snatched from her and beheaded on a stone
 kya samuhik chetana us samay jaagi jab bilkis kii maa or bahan ke saath rape kiya gaya
 Did collective consciousness hit the streets when Bilkis' daughter and 14 of her family were killed
 bilkis ne yah nahin kaha ki faansee se kam par maanenge phir bhi saaleha kii maa bilkis or nirbhaya kii maa aashaa ji kii pratikriyaayein kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 Bilkis has cautioned that we should not lose our senses in the name of religions
 usne The people of India have thanked the people of Gujarat
 bahut se log soch rahe honge ki bilkis ke saath jo hua wo godhra ke baad kii samuhik chetana thi
 Ask the Sikh brothers what was the collective consciousness of 84 in the streets of Delhi
 isliye samuhik chetana se satark rahanaa chahie
 Not every collective consciousness is good
 ek saal tak sunne ke baad justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata main teen jajon kii bench ne faisla diya he
 The accused were given full opportunity to present their case
 sarsari taur par padhate hue laga ki justise mishra ne kaaphi saavdhaanee or satarkta se faisla likhaa he
 Many states have given examples of decisions taken in such cases
 rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, upi, jammu kashmir, andhra pradesh, madhyapradesh ke maamalon kaa zikr faisle main sandarbh ke taur par dikhaa
 It is true that the girls who reached Raisina Hills were not just crowded
 inhen bheed kahkar khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many of the girls in this crowd had left home for the first time in their lives for an issue
 wo bheed banakar kisi ko maarane nahin ai thim balki samvidhan or kanoon ko jagaa rahi thim
 It would be a mistake to reject the crowd of girls who came to Raisina in the name of collective consciousness
 is bheed kii tulana aap us bheed se nahin kar sakate jo bulandshahr main gulam mohammad ko hindu ladki se prem karne ke aarope main maar detii he, jo alvar main gau raksha ke naam par pahalu khan ko maar detii he
 The banners held in the hands of the girls gathered on Raisina, they were dreaming of a better and constitutional society
 yah faisla aitihaasik he
 This incident was really terrible
 itani bhayanak ki aaj bhi uske prasangon kaa zikr karte hue siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 Justice Mishra begins his decision in this way
 
 
 
 The chilly evening of 16 December 2012 in Delhi, along with her partner in the PVR Select City, would not have given the 23-year-old girl any inkling that in the next few hours, a booming night would bring a terrible darkness to her life
 Is supposed to jab wo muniraka bas stand se apane dost ke saath bas main savaar hogi
 She would not have imagined that she was going to fall prey to the lust of a gang of six people, she would be subjected to a murderous attack, it would become a source of fun for them and her personal organs would be severed, for a hunger Nobody would have thought about that
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, magar jaj sahiban ne jis tarah se likhnaa shuru kiya he, faisle ke pehle do teen paragraph se hi man baari ho jaataa he
 Is not read
 aaropee chaahate the ki faansee kii sazaa ho rahi he to har pahalu par thik se sunwaayee ho jaae
 The Supreme Court gave him full opportunity
 aropiyon ke vakil kaa sawaal tha ki exiaar main deree hui
 Meaning the evidence has been tampered with but this is not always true
 exiaar main deree ke sawaal par hi lambii bahes chali he
 If you read the verdict, this debate is going on for at least seventy pages
 court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki deree par shaq karnaa kai vajahon par nirbhar karata he
 However long delays can also be forgiven if the victim does not have motive to implicate the accused
 is cese main peediton ko 11:05 par aspataal main bharti karaayaa gaya
 The statement of the victim boy was recorded at 3:45
 shuruyaat main praathamikta peediton ko medical sahaayta dene kii hoti he
 Even if it is to be delayed, it is absolutely human
 ek doosraa sawaal tha ki exiaar or medico legal cese main aropiyon ke naam darj nahin the to court ne kaha ki exiaar koi encychlopedia nahin hoti he
 The victim is not expected to give complete information about the incident in the FIR itself
 is tarah se ek ek sawaal par sunwaayee hui he
 Like the delay in the FIR, there was a long debate on dyeing declaration as well, but the court said in its judgment that we have no right to believe that any gesture would have been recorded by gesture, gesture Yes, it can be recognized as evidence
 basharte bayaan darj karte vakt puri saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 On the basis of the evidence available on our records, there is a kind of consistency in all the three dyeing declarations i
e
 all three are quite similar, and they are also matched with other evidence
 isliye trial court, hoicourt ne sazaa dene main daaing dicleration ko jo aadhaar mana he, wo sahi he
 Translation of judgment is a difficult task
 phir bhi tamaam bahes se zyada yah faisla hamen sakshar karegaa kyonki jajon ne tamaam pahaluon par gaharaai se likhaa he
 Many may feel that this decision is going to promote the decisions of hanging, so it is too early to think
 balki 402 number pej par justise mishra or justise bhushan likhte hai ki yah cese reerest of rer he yaa nahin, bharat main faansee kii sazaa kii prakriya kai nitigat sudhaaron or nyaayik faislon ke kaaran ab kaaphi viksit ho chuki he, isse pataa chalata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar alag-alag samay main hamaara kya nazariyaa rahaa he, beshak sazaa dene main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa paksh aage rahata he or bharat kaa antarrashtriya daayitv bhi jhalkata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar adaalaton kaa nazariyaa badla he
 In India, the death penalty shutter is moving towards closure, but in the case of rarest of rare, a small window is open
 agar sahi anuwaad hua he to yah hissaa bataata he ki adaalat faansee kii sazaa kii andh samarthak nahin he
 She is growing in this direction based on all the evidence and arguments
 choti si jo khidki khuli hui he uskaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, it is also a judgment that the verdict be read
 is faisle main justise aar bhaanumati kii tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he
 She writes, in the words of the great scholar Vivekananda, the best thermometer of the progress of any nation is what it treats women
 auraton ke kilaaf aparaadh se na sirf unka swabhimaan aahat hota he balki samaaj ke vikaas kii gati bhi ruk jaati he
 i hope that this heinous incident in the capital and the death of a young girl will lead to a mass movement that will end violence against women
 'tippaniyan Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Yeats are usually quoted in the judgment of the judges, seen long after that Vivekananda has been quoted
 ye thik he
 This fight against rape is long
 nirbhaya maamle kaa samuhik chetana aksar un maamalon main khamosh rah jaataa he jo dilli se dur samaaj ke kamazor tabake ko apana shikaar bana rahaa hota he
 In the case of rape of women such as Bilkis Ban and hundreds of unnamed Dalit girls, the day when the women of India reach Raisina, the fight for women will become women
 kade kanoon or sakht sazaa se aparaadh par kya asar padataa he
 If not, six cases of rape would not have been filed in Delhi every day
 rashtriya aparaadh ricard beuro ke anusaar 2013 main balaatkaar ke 33,707 maamle darj hue
 In 2014, there were 36,735 rape cases reported

 4 may ko bombai hai court ne gujarat dangon se jude bilkis baanon cese main ek faisla sunaaya
 In this case, 12 people were sentenced to life imprisonment, besides five police officers and two doctors were also found guilty of erasing evidence
 yani aam janata ke saath-saath state yani rajya ke sadsy bhi bilkis baanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa main shaamil the
 The Bombay High Court upheld the cbi's plea in the case
 19 saal se bilkis baanon apane insaaf kii ladaai lard rahi he lekin kya bilkis ke saath koi samuhik chetana he
 That is why it is important to review a word like collective consciousness
 kya samuhik chetana is baat se vichlit hui ki 19 saal kii bilkis ke saath balaatkaar tab hua jab vah garbhvatee thi
 Was the collective consciousness disturbed when her child was snatched from her and beheaded on a stone
 kya samuhik chetana us samay jaagi jab bilkis kii maa or bahan ke saath rape kiya gaya

 Bilkis has cautioned that we should not lose our senses in the name of religions
 usne The people of India have thanked the people of Gujarat
 bahut se log soch rahe honge ki bilkis ke saath jo hua wo godhra ke baad kii samuhik chetana thi
 Ask the Sikh brothers what was the collective consciousness of 84 in the streets of Delhi
 isliye samuhik chetana se satark rahanaa chahie
 Not every collective consciousness is good
 ek saal tak sunne ke baad justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata main teen jajon kii bench ne faisla diya he
 The accused were given full opportunity to present their case
 sarsari taur par padhate hue laga ki justise mishra ne kaaphi saavdhaanee or satarkta se faisla likhaa he
 Many states have given examples of decisions taken in such cases
 rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, upi, jammu kashmir, andhra pradesh, madhyapradesh ke maamalon kaa zikr faisle main sandarbh ke taur par dikhaa
 It is true that the girls who reached Raisina Hills were not just crowded
 inhen bheed kahkar khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many of the girls in this crowd had left home for the first time in their lives for an issue
 wo bheed banakar kisi ko maarane nahin ai thim balki samvidhan or kanoon ko jagaa rahi thim
 It would be a mistake to reject the crowd of girls who came to Raisina in the name of collective consciousness
 is bheed kii tulana aap us bheed se nahin kar sakate jo bulandshahr main gulam mohammad ko hindu ladki se prem karne ke aarope main maar detii he, jo alvar main gau raksha ke naam par pahalu khan ko maar detii he
 The banners held in the hands of the girls gathered on Raisina, they were dreaming of a better and constitutional society
 yah faisla aitihaasik he
 This incident was really terrible
 itani bhayanak ki aaj bhi uske prasangon kaa zikr karte hue siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 Justice Mishra begins his decision in this way
 
 
 
 The chilly evening of 16 December 2012 in Delhi, along with her partner in the PVR Select City, would not have given the 23-year-old girl any inkling that in the next few hours, a booming night would bring a terrible darkness to her life
 Is supposed to jab wo muniraka bas stand se apane dost ke saath bas main savaar hogi
 She would not have imagined that she was going to fall prey to the lust of a gang of six people, she would be subjected to a murderous attack, it would become a source of fun for them and her personal organs would be severed, for a hunger Nobody would have thought about that
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, magar jaj sahiban ne jis tarah se likhnaa shuru kiya he, faisle ke pehle do teen paragraph se hi man baari ho jaataa he
 Is not read
 aaropee chaahate the ki faansee kii sazaa ho rahi he to har pahalu par thik se sunwaayee ho jaae
 The Supreme Court gave him full opportunity
 aropiyon ke vakil kaa sawaal tha ki exiaar main deree hui
 Meaning the evidence has been tampered with but this is not always true
 exiaar main deree ke sawaal par hi lambii bahes chali he
 If you read the verdict, this debate is going on for at least seventy pages
 court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki deree par shaq karnaa kai vajahon par nirbhar karata he
 However long delays can also be forgiven if the victim does not have motive to implicate the accused
 is cese main peediton ko 11:05 par aspataal main bharti karaayaa gaya
 The statement of the victim boy was recorded at 3:45
 shuruyaat main praathamikta peediton ko medical sahaayta dene kii hoti he
 Even if it is to be delayed, it is absolutely human
 ek doosraa sawaal tha ki exiaar or medico legal cese main aropiyon ke naam darj nahin the to court ne kaha ki exiaar koi encychlopedia nahin hoti he
 The victim is not expected to give complete information about the incident in the FIR itself
 is tarah se ek ek sawaal par sunwaayee hui he
 Like the delay in the FIR, there was a long debate on dyeing declaration as well, but the court said in its judgment that we have no right to believe that any gesture would have been recorded by gesture, gesture Yes, it can be recognized as evidence
 basharte bayaan darj karte vakt puri saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 On the basis of the evidence available on our records, there is a kind of consistency in all the three dyeing declarations i
e
 all three are quite similar, and they are also matched with other evidence
 isliye trial court, hoicourt ne sazaa dene main daaing dicleration ko jo aadhaar mana he, wo sahi he
 Translation of judgment is a difficult task
 phir bhi tamaam bahes se zyada yah faisla hamen sakshar karegaa kyonki jajon ne tamaam pahaluon par gaharaai se likhaa he
 Many may feel that this decision is going to promote the decisions of hanging, so it is too early to think
 balki 402 number pej par justise mishra or justise bhushan likhte hai ki yah cese reerest of rer he yaa nahin, bharat main faansee kii sazaa kii prakriya kai nitigat sudhaaron or nyaayik faislon ke kaaran ab kaaphi viksit ho chuki he, isse pataa chalata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar alag-alag samay main hamaara kya nazariyaa rahaa he, beshak sazaa dene main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa paksh aage rahata he or bharat kaa antarrashtriya daayitv bhi jhalkata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar adaalaton kaa nazariyaa badla he
 In India, the death penalty shutter is moving towards closure, but in the case of rarest of rare, a small window is open
 agar sahi anuwaad hua he to yah hissaa bataata he ki adaalat faansee kii sazaa kii andh samarthak nahin he
 She is growing in this direction based on all the evidence and arguments
 choti si jo khidki khuli hui he uskaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, it is also a judgment that the verdict be read
 is faisle main justise aar bhaanumati kii tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he
 She writes, in the words of the great scholar Vivekananda, the best thermometer of the progress of any nation is what it treats women
 auraton ke kilaaf aparaadh se na sirf unka swabhimaan aahat hota he balki samaaj ke vikaas kii gati bhi ruk jaati he
 i hope that this heinous incident in the capital and the death of a young girl will lead to a mass movement that will end violence against women
 'tippaniyan Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Yeats are usually quoted in the judgment of the judges, seen long after that Vivekananda has been quoted
 ye thik he
 This fight against rape is long
 nirbhaya maamle kaa samuhik chetana aksar un maamalon main khamosh rah jaataa he jo dilli se dur samaaj ke kamazor tabake ko apana shikaar bana rahaa hota he
 In the case of rape of women such as Bilkis Ban and hundreds of unnamed Dalit girls, the day when the women of India reach Raisina, the fight for women will become women
 kade kanoon or sakht sazaa se aparaadh par kya asar padataa he
 If not, six cases of rape would not have been filed in Delhi every day
 rashtriya aparaadh ricard beuro ke anusaar 2013 main balaatkaar ke 33,707 maamle darj hue
 In 2014, there were 36,735 rape cases reported
 2015 main balaatkaar ke 34,651 maamle darj hue
 This entire matter has been covered with great responsibility by our colleague Ashish Bhargava
 ashish un samvaadadaataaon yaa ankaron jitne kismatwale nahin hai jinka photo hording par lagata he magar is samvaadadaata kii har report news main hamen kuch na kuch sikhaa jaati he
 Ashish said that the bench of three judges was a special bench
 is bench ke baithne kaa bhi ek kaayda hota he
 The head of the bench, Justice Deepak Mishra, sits in the middle
 unki daayin ore unase junior justise aar bhaanumati baithi thim
 To the left of Justice Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan was seated, who is the most junior of these three
 is bench ne ek saal tak somvaar, shuukravaar or shanivaar ko sunwaayee kii he
 There are more than 44 hearings
 balki mitegating factor vaale maamle main to 6 march se dobaaraa hearing hui yani jis sawaal ko lekar yah maamla supreme court pahunchaa tha us sawaal par ek saal main do baar sunwaayee hui
 The judges showed no haste
 insaaf kaa palada baari lage isliye aropiyon ke vakeelon kii madad ke liye supreme court ne do bade vakil bhi upabaldh karaaye
 Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde
 in donon ne dilli police kii jaanch or dilli hoicourt ke faisle par khub sawaal kiye
 That means every question got a chance
 final faisle main dilli police kii jaanch kii saraahna kii gai he
 It is not a literal translation
 justise mishra kii angrezi he bhi acchhee or nafis
 Therefore, there may be some mistake
 magar jajment ke sirf is hisse par bhartiya samaaj kii kunthaon par lambii bahes chhid sakati he
 We want to say something while keeping ourselves limited to the collective consciousness
 ek baat dhyaan rakhiyegaa, faisla samuhik chetana ke aadhaar yaa uske liye nahin liya gaya he
 Understanding this will have to reduce the importance of the decision but there is a mention and many people may misunderstand it, so i want to bring the context of Bilkis Ban
 4 may ko bombai hai court ne gujarat dangon se jude bilkis baanon cese main ek faisla sunaaya
 In this case, 12 people were sentenced to life imprisonment, besides five police officers and two doctors were also found guilty of erasing evidence
 yani aam janata ke saath-saath state yani rajya ke sadsy bhi bilkis baanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa main shaamil the
 The Bombay High Court upheld the cbi's plea in the case
 19 saal se bilkis baanon apane insaaf kii ladaai lard rahi he lekin kya bilkis ke saath koi samuhik chetana he
 That is why it is important to review a word like collective consciousness
 kya samuhik chetana is baat se vichlit hui ki 19 saal kii bilkis ke saath balaatkaar tab hua jab vah garbhvatee thi
 Was the collective consciousness disturbed when her child was snatched from her and beheaded on a stone
 kya samuhik chetana us samay jaagi jab bilkis kii maa or bahan ke saath rape kiya gaya
 Did collective consciousness hit the streets when Bilkis' daughter and 14 of her family were killed
 bilkis ne yah nahin kaha ki faansee se kam par maanenge phir bhi saaleha kii maa bilkis or nirbhaya kii maa aashaa ji kii pratikriyaayein kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 Bilkis has cautioned that we should not lose our senses in the name of religions
 usne The people of India have thanked the people of Gujarat
 bahut se log soch rahe honge ki bilkis ke saath jo hua wo godhra ke baad kii samuhik chetana thi
 Ask the Sikh brothers what was the collective consciousness of 84 in the streets of Delhi
 isliye samuhik chetana se satark rahanaa chahie
 Not every collective consciousness is good

 in donon ne dilli police kii jaanch or dilli hoicourt ke faisle par khub sawaal kiye
 That means every question got a chance
 final faisle main dilli police kii jaanch kii saraahna kii gai he
 That is, the general public as well as members of the state were also involved in the violence against the Bilkis Ban
 bombai hai court ne is maamle main sibiai kii daleel ko sahi mana
 For 19 years, Bilkis Ban has been fighting for his justice, but is there any collective consciousness with Bilkis
 isiilie samuhik chetana jaise shabd kii samiksha zaruri he
 Did the collective consciousness distract that 19-year-old Bilkis was raped when she was pregnant
 kya samuhik chetana vichlit hui jab uski bacchee ko usase chhina gaya or ek pathar par sir patakar kar maar diya gaya
 Did collective consciousness awaken when Bilkis was raped along with his mother and sister
 kya samuhik chetana us vakt sadakon par utari thi jab bilkis kii beti or uske parivaar ke 14 log maar diye gaye the
 Bilkis did not say that he would agree on being hanged, yet the reactions of Saleha's mother Bilkis and Nirbhaya's mother Asha ji are quite significant
 bilkis ne saavdhaan kiya he ki ham dharmon ke naam par is tarah apane hosh na ganvaa baithen
 He bharatvasiyon gujaratvaasiyon ko shukriya kaha he
 Many people may be thinking that what happened to Bilkis was the collective consciousness after Godhra
 aap sikh bhaaiyon se puuchhiye 84 kii dilli main sadakon par koun si samuhik chetana thi
 Therefore, one should be alert from collective consciousness
 har samuhik chetana acchhee nahin hoti he
 After hearing for a year, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra has given the verdict
 abhiyukton ko puraa mauka diya gaya apana paksh rakhane kaa
 a cursory reading showed that Justice Mishra had written the verdict very carefully and cautiously
 kai rajyon main is tarah ke maamalon main jo faisle hue hai, unka udhaaharan diya he
 The cases of Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, UP, Jammu Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh were mentioned in the judgment as a reference
 yah baat thik he ki raisina hills par pahunchi ladkiyaan sirf bheed nahin thim
 They cannot be dismissed as a crowd
 is bheed main bahut si ladkiyaan apane jivan main pehali baar kisi mudde ke liye ghar se nikali thim
 She did not come as a mob to kill anyone but was awakening the Constitution and the law
 samuhik chetana ke naam par raisina par ain ladakiyon kii bheed ko riject karnaa galati hogi
 You cannot compare this mob to the mob that kills Ghulam Mohammad in Bulandshahr on the charge of loving a Hindu girl, who kills Kishor Khan in the name of cow protection in Alwar
 raisina par jamaa hui ladakiyon ke haath main jo binar the, wo behatar or sanvaidhanik samaaj ke sapane dekh rahe the
 This decision is historic
 yah ghatana vaaki bhayanak thi
 So terrible that even today, while referring to his episodes, shuddering arises
 justise mishra ne apane faisle kii shuruuaat is tarah se karte hai
 
 
 
 16 disambar 2012 kii dilli kii sard bhari shaam ne apane saathi ke saath piviar salect city main film dekhne gai 23 saal kii ladki ko zaraa bhi bhanak nahin di hogi ki agle kuch ghanton main, tej hoti kanpakapaahat bhari raat uski zindagi main ek bhayanak andhera laane vaali he
 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand
 usne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki wo chah logon ke gang kii havas kaa shikaar hone ja rahi he, usapar jaanaleva hamalaa hoga, wo unke liye mouj masti kaa zariyaa ban jaaegi or nijee angon ko chhin bhinn kar diya jayega, ek aisi bhukh ke liye jiske bare main kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 Literally not a translation, but the way Judge Sahiban started writing, the first two to three paragraphs of the verdict get heavy
 padhaa nahin jaataa he
 The accused wanted that if the execution of the sentence is being done, then every aspect should be properly heard
 supreme court ne unhen puraa mauka diya
 The counsel for the accused was concerned that the FIR was delayed
 matlab saboot ke saath chhedchhad hui he lekin hameshaa yah baat sahi nahin hoti he
 There has been a long debate on the question of delay in the FIR
 faisle kaa padhenge to kam se kam sattar pannon tak yahi bahes chal rahi he
 The court has written in its judgment that doubting the delay depends on several reasons
 haalanki lambii deree bhi maaf kii ja sakati he agar peedit ke paas motive nahin he abhiyukt ko fansaane kaa
 In this case, the victims were admitted to the hospital at 11:05 pm
 3:45 par peedit ladke kaa bayaan record kiya gaya
 Initially the priority is to provide medical assistance to the victims
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki deree hui to ye bilkul maanviya he
 Another question was that the names of the accused in the FIR and Medico legal case were not registered, then the court said that the FIR is not an encyclopedia
 peedit se ummid nahin kii jaati ki wo ghatana kii puri jaankaree exiaar main hi de
 In this way, one question has been heard
 epa ai aar main deree kii tarah daaing diclaration ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa, is par bhi lambii bahes chali he magar court ne apane faisle main kaha ki hamen yah maanane main koi dikkt nahin he ki haav-bhav, ishaare se koi daaing dicleration darj hota he, use sakshya ke taur par manyata di ja sakati he
 Provided that due care has been taken while recording the statement
 hamaare record par jo sakshya uplabdh hai uske aadhaar par sabhi teenon daaing dicleration main ek tarah kii nirantarata dikhti he yani teenon main kaaphi mail he, or anya saakshyon ke saath unka milan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the trial court, the High Court has considered the basis of Dyeing Declaration in sentencing
 faisle kaa anuwaad ek mushkil kaam he
 Nevertheless, this decision will make us more literate than all the debate because the judges have written deeply on all aspects
 bahuton ko lag saktaa he ki yah faisla faansee ke faislon ko badhaava dene vaala he to aisa sochna jaldbaazi hogi
 Rather, on the 402 number page, Justice Mishra and Justice Bhushan write that whether the case is the rarest of rare or not, the process of execution in India has developed a lot due to many policy reforms and judicial decisions, it shows that hanging What has been our view at different times about the punishment, of course, the possibilities of improvement in punishment are ahead and India's international responsibility is also reflected Persons sentenced to death has changed the attitude of the courts
 bharat main faansee kii sazaa kaa shater band hone kii taraf bad rahaa he lekin reerest of rer maamle main ek choti si khidki khuli hui he
 If the correct translation is done, this part shows that the court is not blind to the execution of the sentence
 wo is disha main tamaam sabooton or tarkon ke aadhaar par bad rahi he
 Used a small window that is open
 isliye ek insaaf yah bhi he ki faisle ko padhaa jaae
 Justice r Bhanumathi's comment is also important in this judgment
 wo likhti hai, mahaan vidwaan vivekanand ke shabdon main kisi bhi raashtra kii pragati kaa sabase acha tharmametre yah he ki vah auraton ke saath kya saluk karata he
 Crime against women not only hurts their self-esteem but also stops the development of society
 main ummid karti hum ki rajdhani main hui is jaghanya ghatana or ek noujvaan ladki kii maut se ek janandolan ubharegaa jo ek mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ko khatm karegaa
 Comments aamtaur par jajon ke faisle main shakespeare, vardsaworth, yeats ko hi kot kiya jaataa he, bahut dinon baad dekha ki vivekanand ko kot kiya gaya he
 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 bahut se log soch rahe honge ki bilkis ke saath jo hua wo godhra ke baad kii samuhik chetana thi
 Ask the Sikh brothers what was the collective consciousness of 84 in the streets of Delhi
 isliye samuhik chetana se satark rahanaa chahie
 Not every collective consciousness is good
 ek saal tak sunne ke baad justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata main teen jajon kii bench ne faisla diya he
 The accused were given full opportunity to present their case
 sarsari taur par padhate hue laga ki justise mishra ne kaaphi saavdhaanee or satarkta se faisla likhaa he
 Many states have given examples of decisions taken in such cases
 rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, upi, jammu kashmir, andhra pradesh, madhyapradesh ke maamalon kaa zikr faisle main sandarbh ke taur par dikhaa
 It is true that the girls who reached Raisina Hills were not just crowded
 inhen bheed kahkar khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many of the girls in this crowd had left home for the first time in their lives for an issue

 This incident was really terrible

 Justice Mishra begins his decision in this way
 
 
 
 The chilly evening of 16 December 2012 in Delhi, along with her partner in the PVR Select City, would not have given the 23-year-old girl any inkling that in the next few hours, a booming night would bring a terrible darkness to her life

 She would not have imagined that she was going to fall prey to the lust of a gang of six people, she would be subjected to a murderous attack, it would become a source of fun for them and her personal organs would be severed, for a hunger Nobody would have thought about that

 in donon ne dilli police kii jaanch or dilli hoicourt ke faisle par khub sawaal kiye
 That means every question got a chance
 final faisle main dilli police kii jaanch kii saraahna kii gai he
 This decision is historic
 yah ghatana vaaki bhayanak thi
 So terrible that even today, while referring to his episodes, shuddering arises
 justise mishra ne apane faisle kii shuruuaat is tarah se karte hai
 
 
 
 16 disambar 2012 kii dilli kii sard bhari shaam ne apane saathi ke saath piviar salect city main film dekhne gai 23 saal kii ladki ko zaraa bhi bhanak nahin di hogi ki agle kuch ghanton main, tej hoti kanpakapaahat bhari raat uski zindagi main ek bhayanak andhera laane vaali he
 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand
 usne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki wo chah logon ke gang kii havas kaa shikaar hone ja rahi he, usapar jaanaleva hamalaa hoga, wo unke liye mouj masti kaa zariyaa ban jaaegi or nijee angon ko chhin bhinn kar diya jayega, ek aisi bhukh ke liye jiske bare main kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 Literally not a translation, but the way Judge Sahiban started writing, the first two to three paragraphs of the verdict get heavy
 padhaa nahin jaataa he
 The accused wanted that if the execution of the sentence is being done, then every aspect should be properly heard
 supreme court ne unhen puraa mauka diya
 The counsel for the accused was concerned that the FIR was delayed
 matlab saboot ke saath chhedchhad hui he lekin hameshaa yah baat sahi nahin hoti he
 There has been a long debate on the question of delay in the FIR
 faisle kaa padhenge to kam se kam sattar pannon tak yahi bahes chal rahi he
 The court has written in its judgment that doubting the delay depends on several reasons
 haalanki lambii deree bhi maaf kii ja sakati he agar peedit ke paas motive nahin he abhiyukt ko fansaane kaa
 In this case, the victims were admitted to the hospital at 11:05 pm
 3:45 par peedit ladke kaa bayaan record kiya gaya
 Initially the priority is to provide medical assistance to the victims
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki deree hui to ye bilkul maanviya he
 Another question was that the names of the accused in the FIR and Medico legal case were not registered, then the court said that the FIR is not an encyclopedia
 peedit se ummid nahin kii jaati ki wo ghatana kii puri jaankaree exiaar main hi de
 In this way, one question has been heard
 epa ai aar main deree kii tarah daaing diclaration ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa, is par bhi lambii bahes chali he magar court ne apane faisle main kaha ki hamen yah maanane main koi dikkt nahin he ki haav-bhav, ishaare se koi daaing dicleration darj hota he, use sakshya ke taur par manyata di ja sakati he
 Provided that due care has been taken while recording the statement
 hamaare record par jo sakshya uplabdh hai uske aadhaar par sabhi teenon daaing dicleration main ek tarah kii nirantarata dikhti he yani teenon main kaaphi mail he, or anya saakshyon ke saath unka milan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the trial court, the High Court has considered the basis of Dyeing Declaration in sentencing
 faisle kaa anuwaad ek mushkil kaam he
 Nevertheless, this decision will make us more literate than all the debate because the judges have written deeply on all aspects
 bahuton ko lag saktaa he ki yah faisla faansee ke faislon ko badhaava dene vaala he to aisa sochna jaldbaazi hogi
 Rather, on the 402 number page, Justice Mishra and Justice Bhushan write that whether the case is the rarest of rare or not, the process of execution in India has developed a lot due to many policy reforms and judicial decisions, it shows that hanging What has been our view at different times about the punishment, of course, the possibilities of improvement in punishment are ahead and India's international responsibility is also reflected Persons sentenced to death has changed the attitude of the courts
 bharat main faansee kii sazaa kaa shater band hone kii taraf bad rahaa he lekin reerest of rer maamle main ek choti si khidki khuli hui he
 If the correct translation is done, this part shows that the court is not blind to the execution of the sentence
 wo is disha main tamaam sabooton or tarkon ke aadhaar par bad rahi he
 Used a small window that is open
 isliye ek insaaf yah bhi he ki faisle ko padhaa jaae
 Justice r Bhanumathi's comment is also important in this judgment
 wo likhti hai, mahaan vidwaan vivekanand ke shabdon main kisi bhi raashtra kii pragati kaa sabase acha tharmametre yah he ki vah auraton ke saath kya saluk karata he
 Crime against women not only hurts their self-esteem but also stops the development of society
 main ummid karti hum ki rajdhani main hui is jaghanya ghatana or ek noujvaan ladki kii maut se ek janandolan ubharegaa jo ek mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ko khatm karegaa
 Comments aamtaur par jajon ke faisle main shakespeare, vardsaworth, yeats ko hi kot kiya jaataa he, bahut dinon baad dekha ki vivekanand ko kot kiya gaya he
 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, magar jaj sahiban ne jis tarah se likhnaa shuru kiya he, faisle ke pehle do teen paragraph se hi man baari ho jaataa he
 Is not read
 aaropee chaahate the ki faansee kii sazaa ho rahi he to har pahalu par thik se sunwaayee ho jaae
 The Supreme Court gave him full opportunity
 aropiyon ke vakil kaa sawaal tha ki exiaar main deree hui
 Meaning the evidence has been tampered with but this is not always true
 exiaar main deree ke sawaal par hi lambii bahes chali he
 If you read the verdict, this debate is going on for at least seventy pages
 court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki deree par shaq karnaa kai vajahon par nirbhar karata he
 However long delays can also be forgiven if the victim does not have motive to implicate the accused
 is cese main peediton ko 11:05 par aspataal main bharti karaayaa gaya
 The statement of the victim boy was recorded at 3:45
 shuruyaat main praathamikta peediton ko medical sahaayta dene kii hoti he
 Even if it is to be delayed, it is absolutely human
 ek doosraa sawaal tha ki exiaar or medico legal cese main aropiyon ke naam darj nahin the to court ne kaha ki exiaar koi encychlopedia nahin hoti he
 The victim is not expected to give complete information about the incident in the FIR itself
 is tarah se ek ek sawaal par sunwaayee hui he
 Like the delay in the FIR, there was a long debate on dyeing declaration as well, but the court said in its judgment that we have no right to believe that any gesture would have been recorded by gesture, gesture Yes, it can be recognized as evidence
 basharte bayaan darj karte vakt puri saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 On the basis of the evidence available on our records, there is a kind of consistency in all the three dyeing declarations i
e
 all three are quite similar, and they are also matched with other evidence
 isliye trial court, hoicourt ne sazaa dene main daaing dicleration ko jo aadhaar mana he, wo sahi he
 Translation of judgment is a difficult task
 phir bhi tamaam bahes se zyada yah faisla hamen sakshar karegaa kyonki jajon ne tamaam pahaluon par gaharaai se likhaa he
 Many may feel that this decision is going to promote the decisions of hanging, so it is too early to think
 balki 402 number pej par justise mishra or justise bhushan likhte hai ki yah cese reerest of rer he yaa nahin, bharat main faansee kii sazaa kii prakriya kai nitigat sudhaaron or nyaayik faislon ke kaaran ab kaaphi viksit ho chuki he, isse pataa chalata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar alag-alag samay main hamaara kya nazariyaa rahaa he, beshak sazaa dene main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa paksh aage rahata he or bharat kaa antarrashtriya daayitv bhi jhalkata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar adaalaton kaa nazariyaa badla he
 In India, the death penalty shutter is moving towards closure, but in the case of rarest of rare, a small window is open
 agar sahi anuwaad hua he to yah hissaa bataata he ki adaalat faansee kii sazaa kii andh samarthak nahin he
 She is growing in this direction based on all the evidence and arguments
 choti si jo khidki khuli hui he uskaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, it is also a judgment that the verdict be read
 is faisle main justise aar bhaanumati kii tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he
 She writes, in the words of the great scholar Vivekananda, the best thermometer of the progress of any nation is what it treats women
 auraton ke kilaaf aparaadh se na sirf unka swabhimaan aahat hota he balki samaaj ke vikaas kii gati bhi ruk jaati he
 i hope that this heinous incident in the capital and the death of a young girl will lead to a mass movement that will end violence against women
 'tippaniyan Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Yeats are usually quoted in the judgment of the judges, seen long after that Vivekananda has been quoted
 ye thik he
 This fight against rape is long
 nirbhaya maamle kaa samuhik chetana aksar un maamalon main khamosh rah jaataa he jo dilli se dur samaaj ke kamazor tabake ko apana shikaar bana rahaa hota he
 In the case of rape of women such as Bilkis Ban and hundreds of unnamed Dalit girls, the day when the women of India reach Raisina, the fight for women will become women

 Congress national general secretary Rahul Gandhi intensified his attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttarakhand, saying that the BJP is saying in its advertisements 'khanduri are necessary' today, he wants to ask what Khanduri is up to three months before today
 Were not necessary
 kya uske pehle bhrashtachar jaruri tha?rahul uttarakhand main pithauragarh tathaa kalaadhungi main chunavi jansabhaon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 He said that Khanduri has become necessary now, because the corruption of BJP has to be covered
 unhone kaha, ‘bhaajapa ko us samay bhrashtachar kii yaad kyon nahin aayi jab vah kendra main satta main thi or bhrashtachar par bhrashtachar ho rahaa tha
 At that time, why did their leader LK Advani not take a rath yatra against corruption
 us samay to vah apane kamare main baithkar tivi dekha karte the
 The Congress general secretary in his zeal asked why the BJP does not see corruption in the states of Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat
 adwani se poocha janaa chaiye ki unhone apane rathyatra ke dauraan karnataka ke bhrashtachar ke bare main kya logon se zikr kiya tha
 If not, then why did not he? He said that corruption will not end with a magic wand, rather it will have to end slowly
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kendra main jab congress kii sarkaar garibon, kisaanon tathaa mazdooron ke kalyaan ke liye yojanaye shuru karti he to bhaajapa ke netaa kahana shuru kar dete hai ki paisa bekaar kiya ja rahaa he
 He said, 'I want to ask if money is wasted by starting development schemes for the common people of this country
 hamane kisaanon ke 60 hajaar karod rupee karj maaf kiya, soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat prashasan ko paardarshee banaaya, mahatmagandhi gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium ke tahat berozegaron ko rojgaar kii guarantee di to kya yah paisa barabaad kiya gaya
 He said, 'we are going to give the right to food to the whole of India
 iske liye jald hi adhinium banaaya jaayegaa
 We spend public money by asking the public
 is desh main paisa aam janata kaa he
 There is no money from Congress or BJP
 aapke bhavishya kaa paisa he, jise aap par hi kharch kiya jaataa he
 Money does not drip from the sky
 yah aam janata ke khun paseene kaa paisa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that in Uttarakhand why BJP had not seen corruption before Khanduri, which Khanduri has become so important today
 uttarakhand main khanduri jaruri nahin hai balki vikaas or pragati jaruri he
 The Congress General Secretary strongly criticized the BJP on the issue of corruption and said that the dream of the whole country was to set up an independent Lokpal on the lines of the Election Commission so that there is no interference in its functioning
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jis tarah se chunaav ayog nishpaksh or swatantra tareeke se chunaav karaata he or uske kaary main koi bhi dakhal nahin de saktaa he
 In the same way, the Lokpal should also work in an independent and impartial manner, such thinking was not only for his party but for the whole country
 unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘bhartiya janata party ne apni hathvadita ke chalate use sansad main uske khilaaf laal batan dabaa diya
 Killed a constitutional ombudsman
 yah sirf hamaara sapana nahin tha balki puure desh kaa sapana tha
 'he said,' Corruption from this country will end when the common man comes actively in politics
 ham rajnatik pranali ko badalane kii koshish main lage huye hai
 For this, we have to fight a long battle
 ham vah sapana dekh rahe hai jab desh ke rajnatik pranali se har naagarik khush ho
 'rahul Gandhi appealed to the people that those who were not talking about corruption in Uttarakhand till three months ago, tell them to talk about development
 unhone kaha ki congress ne yuvaaon ko is chunaav main ummidavaar banaaya he or unhone yuvaaon ko khaastaur par hidaayat di he ki kisi bhi haalat main bhrashtachar ko kisi bhi str par bardaasht nahin kiya jaayegaa
