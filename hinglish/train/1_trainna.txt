 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) seems to be spreading its footprint in Jammu and Kashmir, from the restoration and restoration of desolate temples in the Kashmir Valley to the expansion of branches in the Himalayas to new heights

 aresas prachaarak na sirf ghati, balki jammu main bhi viraan pade mandiron kaa jirnoddhar karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 On the restoration of historical temples in the state, the RSS has written in its annual report (2019), "puramandal is a holy site situated on the banks of the Devika River, 40 km from Jammu

 The top RSS official in Jammu and Kashmir said, "under this, a teacher runs a class in a school

 aresas adhikari ne kaha, "ham un logon ke saath hai jo sochate hai ki jansankhya ke aadhaar par jammu kshetra main zyada vidhansabha siten honi chahie
 We hope that the government will consider their demand
 " sutron ne kaha ki aresas netaa sochate hai ki sarkaar ko vidhansabha siton ke parisemen par vichaar karnaa chahie, kyonki faruk abdulla ne yah kadam kashmir ghati main muslim voton par najar rakhkar raajnneetik dalon ko phayda dene ke uddeshy se uthaaya tha
 However, the recent division of borders (if the Delimitation Commission brings it up) could change the political map of the state, given the larger size that more delegates would come from Jammu

 haal hi main launch hue iphone 7 or iphone 7 Plus kii keemat bhi 72,000 rupee se shuru hoti he or iphone 7 Plus ke top model kii keemat 92,000 rupee he
 That is, a smartphone will cost 72,000 or 92,000 rupees and for this reason most Indian users will not buy it
 bhartiya yugers ke paas hameshaa se saste ifonkhareedne kaa opshan rahata he
 We are talking about old model iphones, whose prices drop significantly after the new iphone launch
 haal hi main company iphone 6s kii keemat main 22,000 rupee kii katautee kii he
 But it was not until a few years ago, because at that time the old iphones were not better than Android in terms of price and specification
 udhaaharan ke taur par tab Nexus 5 ke mukaable 30,000 rupee main bikne vaala iphone 5 behatar nahin tha
 But even then Apple did not target the Indian market to make a cheaper iphone
 20-25 hajaar tak ke segment main android ko mil sakati he takkarhaalanki company ko ab saste yphone banane kii jarurat bhi nahin he
 Because companies like Samsung and Lenovo have the highest market share in this segment and Apple does not need it
 lekin hai segment jisamen 20,000 rupee se 25,000 rupee ke smartphone beche jate hai isamen appal apni upasthiti tagade taur par darj kara sakati he
 And for this the company does not need to bring cheap phones
 appal android smartfones ko20,000 rupee tak ke range main apnepurane iphone ke jariye kadi takkar de saktaa he
 Hardware and software is the reason behind the competition of older iphones to new Android smartphones
 2014 se pehle tak choti screen kii vajah se pichhadta tha yphone2014 se appal nae iphone 6 ke saath 4
 Started bringing 7 inch screen
 iske alaava ek doosraa iphone 6 Plus bhi aayaa jisaki screen sies 5
 5 inches
 ab baari thi in donon ke android se compair karne kii or isamen yah donon smartphone android par baari pade
 Earlier, Android did not compare to iphone in terms of screen size
 iphone 5S main company powerful A7 procesar lagaaya jiske baad company ne A8 or A9 procesar bhi laai
 Till this time there was not such fast processor option in Android market, due to which they were lagging behind
 zyaadaatar procesar mediatech or qolkom ke hote the
 Although Samsung and Huawei also had their own processors
 lekin koi bhi procesar appal ke procesar ko takkar dene laayak nahin tha
 With fast processors, the company used to provide good screen, better camera, fast internal storage and strong battery in its iphone
 2014 main iphone 6 ek behtareen smartphone kaa paryaay ban gaya or yah 50,000 rupee se zyada main bika
 But the top end Android smartphones in 2016 are not as good as 2014
 philhal iphone 6 kii keemten kaaphi kam ho gai hai, lekin phir bhi yah kai hai and android smartphone se kai myanon main behatar he
 The software provided in the iphone makes it better than Android 6 and iphone 6s is better than the software given in it
 kyonki appal samay samay par apane ioes main apadet dekar isamen nae fitures jodta rahata he
 However, Google has tried to improve Marshmallow and the new Android version Nougat
 android kii dikkat yah he ki iske nae varjan kaa apadet sabhi android smartfones main nahin mil paata he
 Apple's new ios 10 update is being received in the iphone 5, launched in 2012, but even if you are using a new Android smartphone of Rs 60,000, there is no guarantee that the update will be available or not
 kuch saal puraane yphone haal main launch hue kai android smartphone ko kadi takkar dete hai
 Whether it is of simple performance and design, or of camera and other apps, old iphones are seen to be winning all these
 aane vaale dinon main sabhi bazaar main iphone 7 or iphone 7 Plus uplabdh honge
 But if the budget of most phone buyers today is up to 30-35 thousand, then they can buy older iphones like iphone 6 better than Android
 dakshin dilli ke aarake puram thane kii police ne vaahan choron kaa ek aisa shaatir giroh pakadaa he, jo mahaj 30 second main chori kii vaardaat ko anjaam dekar use dilli se baahar meerut main bech diya karata tha

 com / m2nnnrt2n0 Let us know that after resigning from the Congress a day ago, Sanjay Singh said that the Congress is still in the past, and he knows nothing about the future
 aaj desh piem modi ke saath he
 If the country is with PM Modi, then i am also with PM
 maine party se istipha dene ke saath-saath rajyasabha kii sadsytase bhi istipha de diya he
 Sanjay Singh's wife Amita Singh also resigned from the Congress
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki 'party main vichaar hinata he kaaryakartaaon main niraashaa he
 That is why he resigned
 unhone kaha ki gandhi parivaar se jo rishte hai usamen kahin koi gadabad nahin he
 The people of the country have accepted BJP
 pradhanmantri sabko saath lekar chalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Amita Singh said that 'we are doing politics
 donon kii soch, drushtikon ek hai
 i did not leave because he is my husband, but thoughts meet each other
 yah koi ek din kii soch nahin he, yah koi naaraazgi kaa faisla nahin he, ham nesan building ke liye agar aage aae hai to hamen nahin lagata ki congress main aisa mauka he
 It seems to me that there will be such an opportunity under Modi ji's leadership
 yah ek sochaa samajha samay kaa nirnay he
 ' sanathan sanstha ek baar phir vivaadon ke ghere main aa gayi hai
 This time the dispute is related to Vaibhav Raut, a member of the institution
 mumbai ke nalasopara main aties ne vaibhav raut ke ghar or dukaan par chhapemari kii, is dauraan kareeb 8 bam baraamad kiye gaye
 Also, detonators and bomb making materials have also been found
 sanathan sanstha kaa gathan 1990 main jayant balaji athavle dwaara kii gayi thi
 This organization mainly works in the fields of spirituality, education and religion
 sanathan santaande kaaryakartaaon par pehle bhi kai aarope lagate rahe hai
 Its founder Jayant Balaji Athawale himself is an expert on hypnotherapist by profession
 goa kii rajdhani panaji se kareeb 28 kilometre dur ek gaanv main sanathan sanstha kaa mukhyalay he
 The institution has been in constant controversy for the last few years
 is sanstha ko lekar baari bahes bhi chali thi ki ise aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kiya jaae yaa nahin
 There was also a dispute about banning this institution
 april 2017 main maharashtra vidhaan parishad ko jaankaree dete hue ye kaha gaya tha kii rajya sarkaar ne sanathan sanstha par pratibandh lagane ke liye centre ko ek prastaav bhi bheja tha
 Many people, organizations and political parties in Maharashtra are demanding a ban on the Hindutva organization Sanatan Sanstha for its alleged role in the murders of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare
 pehle bhi lage hai aaropis santhaan se jude logon kii giraftaari 2007 main ghatit washi, thane, panwel or 2009 main goa bam dhamaake ke liye kiya gaya tha
 The name of Sanatan Sanstha is also associated with the murder of Narendra Dabholkar, MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Gauri Lankesh
 maharashtra police or sibiai jo in cese kaa anusandhan kar rahi he, purv main iske sansthaapak jayant balaji athavle se poochtacha kii thi
 However, in December 2015, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha informed that any link between the murders of Govind Pansare, Narendra Dabholkar and MM Kalburgi could be revealed
 in hatyaon main koi sambandh nahin hai
 Together, he also said that at present there is no proposal to ban the right wing organization Sanatan Sanstha
 bharat ko hindu raashtra banane kaa daawa karne vaali ye sanstha is tarah ke kai vivaadon ke kaaran tarkshastriyon or logo ke nishane main rahi hai
 These questions are starting to arise in the minds of common people, why are Sanatan Sanstha not being banned till now
 raajnneeti main aarakshan card koi nai baat nahin he
 But a new and unique example has been seen in the politics of Bihar
 daliton ke liye desh ke kai rajyon main naukari main aarakshan he
 But now the Bihar government is also going to reserve the post of SHO i
e
 police station in-charge for the Dalits
 police mukhyalay ke kamjor varg shakha ne is babat ek adwijuri bhi jari kii he
 According to the advisory, all sps and cids in the state have been directed that 17 percent of the shos in the district should be dalit-adivasi
 inamen 16 fisadi daliton or 1 fisadi pad par adivasee adhikari honge
 Arvind Pandey, ADG of the weaker section branch, says that despite having a sufficient number of Dalit officers, their deployment to SHOK posts in the stations is quite low
 haalanki is puri kavayad main police mahakama dalit agenda se saaf inkaar kar rahaa he
 Arvind Pandey says, "to instill a sense of trust in a large section of the state, it is necessary that they also get proper participation
" ' police mukhyalay ne is disha-nirdesh ko sahi tehraane ke liye ek list bhi jari kii he, jisamen saaf dikhataa he ki 17 se 20 fisadi dalit adhikari hone ke baavjood inaki tainaati mahaj 12 fisadi ke aasapaas he
 According to this list, Dalit-tribal shos are deployed in only 7 of the 73 police stations in Patna
 isi tarah arriya ke 13 thanon main se ek main, sitamarhi ke 20 thanon main se teen main, navgachhiya main 2, lakhisarai main 3 or bhagalpur sirf 6 thanon main dalit-adivasee esechao tainaat hai
 However, this exercise of the government in Bihar immediately before the election raises many questions, then the use of the word 'competent officer' in the departmental letter also indicates a new debate
 film- kedarnathnirdeshak- abhishek kapoorstarcast- sushant singh rajput, sara ali khan, puja gaur, nitish bharadwajasrtificate- u / aretimgsa- 3
 Sara Ali Khan is making her Bollywood debut from 5 Kedarnath
 saf ali khan or amrutha singh kii beti sara ke bollywood debyue kaa intjaar sabhi ko tha
 Now that wait is over
 abhishek kapur ke nirdesan main bani film main sushant singh rajput sara ke apojit role main hai
 So let's know how Sara's first film is like
 kya he film kikahani?kedarnath ek aisi film he jo bollywood kii vahi lav story bayaan karti he jo amuman har duusari film main dikhaai detii he
 It has been linked to the Holocaust in Kedarnath in 2013
 ladkaa, ladki, pyaar, izhaar, inkaar or phir ikraar ke saath kahani main do pariwaron ke bich hone vaala ghamaasan yuddh bhi he
 The story of Kedarnath begins with Mandakini alias Mukku (sara Ali Khan), the daughter of a Hindu pundit who is extremely stubborn, happy and easygoing
 mukku ko ek muslim pitthu (tirthayatriyon ko kandhe par uthaanewaala) mansoor (sushant singh rajput) se pyaar ho jaataa he
 People of two different religions do not like the love of the plaintiff and then a lot of struggle starts to break this love
 is puri kahani main twist tab aata he jab mandakini or mansoor ke pyaar ko todane ke liye panditon or pitthuon ke bich jang chhid jaati he or isi bich kudarat bhi apana kahar barapa detaa he
 Why watch the film? First of all, watch the film for Isara Ali Khan
 movie ko dekhne ke baad jo cheez sabase zyada aapke dimag par chhap chhodti he wo he sara ali khan
 Sara is as beautiful and flawless as the natural, and her beauty and frivolity are clearly visible on the screen
 film dekhakar lagata hi nahin kii ye unki pehali film he
 In one scene of the film, Sara was confident and strong
 iske alaava sushant singh rajput ne bhi is puri film main kaaphi mehnat kii he
 Sushant has worked hard physically
 film main wo ek pitthu ke kirdaar main hai
 There are many beautiful moments filmed between Sara and Sushant in the film, which sometimes gives Sara a glimpse of her mother Amrita Singh
 film kii cinemetography bhi kaaphi acchhee he
 The beauty of the plaintiff is beautifully praised by Tushar Kanti Roy with the camera and the drone
 kamjor kadiyanfilm kii kamjor kadi kii baat karen to wo he isaki kahani
 The story of Kedarnath is battered
 saath hi film main jarurat ke mutabik, gane hi nahin hai
 Apart from singing 'namo Namo' Amit Trivedi has not shown any special feat
 vahiin duusari ore film kii kahani kaaphi pridictable he or clymex bhi thodaa behatar ho saktaa tha
 TV actress Tejashwi Prakash's whatsapp account has been hacked
 actress ne khud iske bare main jaankaree di he
 Tejashwi said that the accused is using my whatsapp account for pornographic video calls
 tejasvi ne spotboy se baatcheet main kaha- 'jis vyakti ne meraa phone hack kiya he, wo mere contact ke saath bahut hi dostana lahaze main baat kar rahaa he
 With this, he is sharing a link, and is asking them to send the code
 phir, jaise hi ve use whatsap par code bhejte hai, vah video colling karata he
 If you pick up the video call, then you will see that someone is doing wrong things in front of you
 ''ravivaar ko main colors tivi ke sho mira road kii shooting main biji thi
 Suddenly i got a video call while i was on set
 jaise hi maine video kol kaa jawaab diya to dekha ki saamne koi neude aadmi khadaa he
 She got scared on seeing this

 Tejaswitjevi, who will go to the police station, said- 'I got calls from Karishma Tanna, Tanya Sharma and many others
 wo sabhi bhi isse shocked hai
 This is very embarrassing for me because, i am an actress from above
 mere kai doston ne mujhe kol kiya or chintaa vyakt kii
 But after all, what of those people who do not know me very closely, what kind of impression they might have had on me
 'aagetejasvine kaha- 'maine sibar cell main kol kiya
 They asked me to lodge a complaint at the nearby police station
 lekin kyonki main raat ke teen vajah tak kaam kar rahi thi isliye police ke paas nahin ja pai
 However, i will soon go to the police station

 Who will spend to make the well fixed? According to Ramesh Guhare, a resident of the village, women initially urged men to cooperate, but then they asked what would we get? They were not willing to work without wages
 enjio ne 3 kilo chaaval prati mahila prati din dene kaa sahyog kiya, jiske baad mahilaayein kaam ko raji huin
 But now the well has to be confirmed, it will cost a lot, but there is a question about who will spend it? This success, inspired by the shared labor of women ministers who have been reduced to commercials, is now motivating people too

 Lt
 Gen
 Jacob, the Staff Officer of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army, was the first officer to reach Dhaka, handling the front in the war with Pakistan in 1971

 It is often said about marriage that it is such a laddoo that the eater also regrets and the eater does not regret it either
 jab tak shaadi nahin hui hoti he ham dusron ko dekhakar is rishte ke bare main kayaas lagaate rahete hai
 Sometimes we like this relationship and sometimes like a bond
 par ye bilkul bhi jaruri nahin he ki dusron ke anubhav aapke liye bhi sach sabit hon
 There is a lot of chaos in every relationship, but to maintain a relationship like marriage, the most important thing is that husband and wife should work wisely and try to solve every problem together
 shaadi ke baad bahut si chijen badal jaati hai
 These are some such changes about which no one can explain to you nor can tell the way to overcome them
 yahaan aisi paanch baton kaa zikr he jinka anubhav shaadi karne ke baad hi kiya ja saktaa he:1
 If you are single then marriage can overcome this lack of your life to some extent, but getting married is not the solution to every problem
 jivan kii kai samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye aapako hi prayaas karnaa hoga
 2
 mana kii shaadi do logon ko jodne kaa kaam karti he lekin shaadi ke baar har samay apane partner ke saath rahanaa, na to use kahin apane bina jane dena or na to khud janaa, galat he
 It is wrong to think that love will remain between you only by being together all the time
 is baat se aapkaa partner iritate bhi ho saktaa he
 3
 shaadi ke din duulhaa or dulhan donon ke hi chehre par ek alag nur hota he
 Sometime after marriage, things do not remain as before and boys and girls lose little focus on themselves
 par iskaa ye matlab to bilkul nahin ab wo aakarshak nahin rah gaya he yaa rah gai he
 It is better to accept this change that comes with other responsibilities
 4
 During marriage, all kinds of vows are made that the love between us will always remain, but the truth is that over time the form of love starts changing
 aise main is baat ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hi behatar hoga
 5
 shaadi ke din shaayad hi koi aisa hota hoga jo ye sochataa hoga ki use kabhi apane partner se nafrat ho jaaegi
 But after a few years of marriage, sometimes there is so much discord about something that one feels the same in mind, i wish it was better if not married

 Who are these people? Why is this bothering Jethalal? Or is it a prank of the members of the Gokuldham Society? Jethalal has to struggle to answer all these questions

 In view of the international pressure to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack, Pakistan has assured foreign representatives in Islamabad a fair probe into the attack
 yadhyapi bharat ne is jaanch ko keval ek bahanebaaji bataaya he
 An official said the ambassadors were told that Pakistan would not hand over any suspects to India but assured everyone that the matter would be investigated in a transparent manner and that they would be prosecuted impartially in the country
 adhikariyon ke anusaar kai rajdooton ne pakistan dwaara kii ja rahi jaanch ke bare main kuraishi or malik se kai sawaal bhi puche
 Despite this, India said that Pakistan has not taken adequate action in relation to the Mumbai attack

 Pakistan has clarified that PM Modi did not 'offer talks' in a letter to PM Imran of the neighboring country
 pakistani videsh karyaalay ke pravaktaa ne bhartiya media main aa rahi khabaron ke sambandh main ek sawaal ke jawaab main yah bayaan jari kiya he
 The spokesman emphasized that Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi did not say that 'the Indian Prime Minister has offered talks'
 lekin unhone kaha tha ki modi ne khan ko likhe patr main kuch isi tarah kaa zikr kiya jaisaa videsh mantri ne pehle spasht kiya tha ki 'rachanaatmak baatcheet ke jariye hi aage badha ja saktaa he
 Pakistan's Foreign Office said that former Law Minister Ali Zafar of Pakistan visited India on August 18 to attend the funeral of former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 is dauraan videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke saath jafar kii mulaakaat se bane sakaaratmak or rachanaatmak maahaul ke bare main videsh mantri ko bhi bataaya gaya
 The office said that Pakistan is excited for a mutually beneficial, unabated dialogue with India to resolve all issues
 pravaktaa ne media ko aade haathon lete hue kaha, 'vivaad paidaa karne or maahaul bigaadane kii koi bhi koshish galat he or jimmedaar patrakarita kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 However, earlier in the first conversation with the media, Qureshi mentioned PM Modi's letter to Imran Khan

 Although the Supreme Court has not stayed the case, but the order secured on the appeal of Jayalalithaa in the Karnataka High Court has now been deferred
 diemke kii yachika par aadesh sunaate hue justise madan lokur ne kaha ki vishesh sarkari vakil bhavani singh hycourt main bina anumati ke hissaa le rahe the, isliye jaya kii apil puri tarah galat he
 This appeal should be heard again in the High Court
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki agar yachikakarta ke aarope sahi hai to ye cese is baat kaa sateek udhaaharan he ki aaropee ne kis tarah prabhaav or takat kaa istemaal kar cese ko 15 saal tak patari se utaare rakhaa or agar aarope galat bhi hai to ye saaf he ki cese ke niptaare main 15 saal lage
 At the same time, Justice Bhanumati in his judgment justified the appointment of Bhavani Singh
 unhone kaha ki vakil kii niyukti cese ke liye kii jaati he, kisi court ke liye nahin
 With this, the case was sent to the court of three judges
 yani ab jayalalita ko apni apil par faisle ke liye or intjaar karnaa hoga
 However, before this, the High Court has reserved the order after all the hearings on 11 March itself
 lekin ab teen jajon kii bench ke faisle par hi sab nirbhar hoga
 DMK leader Ambazhagan has said in his petition that Bhavani Singh was a public prosecutor in the lower court
 unhen hai court main sarkari vakil nahin banaaya ja saktaa

 Stars like Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Priyanka Chopra have also reacted to the Pulwama terror attack and expressed grief over it
 jab navjot singh siddhu mantri bane the, tab bhi yah sawaal uthaa tha ki kya vah pad par rahete hue kapil sharma sho kaa hissaa ho sakate hai? iske baad punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne kanoonee salaah lee thi or uske baad kaha tha ki navjot singh siddhu pad par rahete hue bhi vah sho kaa hissaa ho sakate hai
 Let us tell you that Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister in the Punjab government, came under target when he reached Pakistan to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Imran Khan
 vahiin videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne jane se inkaar kar diya tha
 At the same time, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also disagreed on Sidhu's decision

 BJP Citizen Chandra Bose, AIUDF leader Aminul Islam, Jadavpur University Professor of English Monojit Mandal, Supreme Court lawyer Upamanyu Hazarika and former Chief of the Center for Research and Planning of the Supreme Court in the 'citizen Who- NRC vs Citizenship Amendment Act' session Mahajan expressed his opinion
 manch kaa sanchaalan rahul kanwal, news diarector, tivi today network ne kiya
 Krishna Mahajan, former head of the Center for Research and Planning of the Supreme Court, while giving his opinion on the subject, said that first of all Indians are given fundamental duties and fundamental rights in the Constitution
 samvidhan ke tahat ham bharat ko samgr saanskrithik viraasat banane ke liye baadhya hai
 If we want to change it, we can do it but it should not be done
 artical 29 ke tahat yah hamaara moulik adhikaar he ki ham apni bhashaa, dharm or apni samskruti chunane ke liye swatantra hai
 The definition of what culture is is the way of living with each other
 unhone aage kaha ki artical 29 hamen kai saare homework karne ke liye bhi kahata he
 It wants the mapping of different cultures of India and all the cultural belts of India
 iske saath hi yah ye bhi chahta he ki sabake moulik adhikaron kii raksha ho

 Neighboring countries should not be talked about
 isliye aaj kii maang he ki aakhir koun hai alpsankhyak
 Should it be calculated on the population or should it be based on culture
 is par baat honi chahie
 Now culturally, minority needs to be decided
 aaj kii demand cultural citigenship kii he
 Which is not being done by any political party
 citigenship amendament bill par baat karte hue mahajan ne kaha ki kya hamen is bill kii jarurat he
 You have a lot of rules like Passport Act from which you can separate people, so what is the need of it
 mujhe lagata he ki is vishay par do tarah kii baaten hoti hai ek raajnneetik tarika jis par kaha ja rahaa he ki yah vot kii khatir kiya ja rahaa he
 But you have to see how many people from outside you are going to give citizenship
 is par bijepi netaa bose ne kaha ki hamaara asal mudda logon ko ek stream line main laane kaa tha

 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne somvaar ko kaha ki ye chintajanak he ki supreme court ke aadesh or dishanirdesh ke baad bhi paryaapt intjaam nahin kiye gaye hai
 The Supreme Court asked the amicus (justice friend) to suggest what they can do to bring justice to children suffering from sexual offenses
 emicas ne kaha ki posco kii special court kii sthapana or special trend sarkari vakeelon se hi badlaav hoga
 The Supreme Court said that the figures we are getting are from January 1 to June 30

 Five years ago, when the BJP brought its manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections 2014, it was considered to be very favorable for business and industry
 kaarobaar jagat ko modi sarkaar se kaaphi ummiden bhi thim
 In this manifesto, BJP made many promises like making India a strong economy and increasing employment
 aaj paanch saal baad jab bijepi 2019 ke liye ghoshnaptr jari kar rahi he to is baat kii samiksha karte hai ki usne inamen se koun se aarthik vaade puure kiye
 On inflation, inflation reached a peak in the country during the tenure of the government
 isliye bijepi kaa sabase bada vaada yah bhi tha ki sarkaar banane ke baad vah mahangaai par niyantran karegi
 The BJP had said that special courts would be set up to stop hoarding and black marketing
 tamaam anukool paristhitiyon or sarkari prayaas kii vajah se isamen safalataa bhi mili he
 Wholesale price based annual inflation in February 2019 only 2
 93 fisadi thi
 However, special courts have not been formed
 naukariyaan hi naukariyambijapi ne apane ghoshnaptr main yuvaaon ko bade paimaane par rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 BJP had said that it would try to increase employment by promoting labor based manufacturing and tourism
 employament exenjon ko rojgaar kendron main badalane kii baat kahi gai thi
 Schemes like Start Up India, Mudra Loan, Skill India have made efforts to increase employment opportunities among the youth
 lekin rojgaar ke morche par modi sarkaar ko sabase zyada aalochana kaa shikaar hona padaa
 The opposition was the most aggressive attacker on the employment front
 modi sarkaar par aankade chhipaane ke aarope lage
 Despite the growth in the economy ie jobless growth in the country, there were allegations of not having a significant increase in employment
 kalaadhan waapas laaengebjapi ne vaada kiya tha ki desh main bhrashtachar par ankush lagegaa or kaale dhan ko waapas laayaa jayega
 The BJP had promised to create a mechanism that would leave no scope for corruption
 bijepi ne kaha tha ki vah videshi bainko main jamaa kaala dhan waapas laane ke liye vah patibaddh he or ise patibaddhta ke aadhaar par kiya jayega
 It was promised to form a task force to bring back black money
 oparation clin mani, notebandi, benami kanoon main badlaav aadi se desh main kaale dhan par ankush ke liye sarkaar ke tamaam prayaas safal rahe hai
 a task force was also formed as soon as the government was formed, but there has not been much success in bringing black money from abroad
 enpie main kami laaengesaal 2014 ke apane ghoshnaptr main bijepi ne kaha tha ki vah aise kadam uthaaegi jisase bainkon ke enpie main kami aae
 But on this front, the government can be called a failure
 bainkon kaa enpie lagaataar bad rahaa he
 Total NPA of banks in the country in the year 2014
 92 lakh karod rupee kaa tha
 Total NPA of all banks in September 2016 7
 07 lakh karod rupee tha
 By March 2018, the total npas of all banks in the country had crossed the Rs 10 lakh crore mark
 haalanki sitambar 2018 tak yah thodaa ghatakar 9
 99 lakh crores reached
 sarkaar ne bed lone ke maamle main rigerv bank ko dakhal dene ke liye zyada adhikaar die hai or bainkon ke bahikhaate ko durust karne ke liye saal 2017 main kareeb 32 arab dollar kaa ricapitaliseshan plan manjuur kiya gaya
 The tax system and the GSTBJP had stated in their 2014 manifesto that the tax panic of the UPA has caused frustration in the business class and negatively impacted the investment climate
 bijepi sabhi rajya sarkaron ko jiesti ke liye taiyaar karegi or jiesti ko prabhavi tareeke se lagu karegi
 BJP has also fulfilled this promise
 desh main jiesti ko prabhavi tareeke se lagu kiya gaya he or isse puure desh main ek tex pranali lagu ho gai he
 However, the opposition has also been critical of the government over its change in rates and reasonableness
 yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki sarkaar ne bina khaas taiyaari ke achaanak jiesti lagu kar diya jisase vyapaaree varg ko kaaphi pareshaani hui
 On the FDI front, BJP had said in the 2014 manifesto that FDI will be brought only in those areas where jobs and capital are created
 jahaan aadharbhoot dhaanche ke liye takneekee or visheshgy gyaan kii jarurat ho

 But this much is certain that women have got another option in the form of the Mental Cup

 dilli se sate gajiabad ke thana kavinagar ilaake main ek dardanaak ghatana saamne ai he
 The case is of late Wednesday, where a father and son went on a bike to take food from the hotel
 jis vakt vah hotel se waapas laut rahe the tabhi achaanak hi tej gati se aa rahe vaahan ne unhen rond daalaa
 During this time the father died on the spot
 jabaki putr ki donon taang alag ho gai
 Despite being unconscious, he kept telling the 10-year-old teenager his number
 aanan-fanan main sthaneey logon or police kii madad se gambhir haalat main 10 varshiya kishor ko paas ke hi sarvoday aspataal main pahunchaaya gaya
 But on reaching the hospital, the teenager also died
 udhar sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki jis vaahan ne pita or putr ko kuchlaa he, vah maukey se bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 It is not yet known which vehicle had trampled the two

 a student studying in class x first took her exam
 uske baad is saahsee beti ne lautakar apane pita or bhai ko mukhaagni di
 Let me tell you that 43-year-old Ravindra Sagar police station was living with his family in Avantika JPV apartment in Kavinagar area
 unka ek 10 varshiya putr garvit or ek putree riya he jo ki kaksha 10 main padhati he
 Riya's CBSE examination has started from Thursday
 ravindra ghar ke baahar hi plastic crockeri kii dukaan chalaate the
 He was accompanied by his wife Reena, daughter Riya Maa Lakshmi Devi
 ravindra sagar ke ek bade bhai hai anil sagar
 They also have two daughters
 garvit do bhaaiyon ke parivaar main iklauta putr tha
 Gervit's result was about to come, in the joy of which both the children urged their father to eat hotel food, the father rode with his son on his bike to take food at the dhaba to fulfill the wishes of his children
 khaanaa lene ke baad jaise hi vah ghar waapas laut rahe the, isi bich hapur chungi chauraahey ke paas ek tej gati vaahan ne unki bike ko rond daalaa or maukey se faraar ho gaya
 During this, Ravindra Sagar died on the spot while his son's legs were separated
 vah besudh haalat main bhi maujuud logon ko apni bahan kaa number bataa rahaa tha
 Soon the locals informed the police
 maukey par pahunchi police or sthaneey logon ne garvit ko gambhir haalat main sarvoday aspataal pahunchaaya
 But on reaching the hospital, he too succumbed
 baharhaal is haadase main pita or putr donon kii hi maut ho gai
 As soon as the information about this painful accident came to his family and relatives and neighbors, there was a furore in the area
 unki beti riya kaa dasvin kaksha kaa sibiesai kaa guuruuvaar ko paper tha
 Riya gave her paper first, with great courage
 uske baad apane pita or bhai ko mukhaagni di
 At the time Riya was lighting her father and brother, the eyes of the people present there became moist
 har kisi ke man main yah sawaal tha ki aakhir ab is parivaar kaa laalan-paalan kis tarah se hoga
 People were also convinced of this courage of the girl child
 udhar riya kaa kahana he ki uske pita kaa sapana tha ki vah badi hokar doctor bane
 Riya said that she will be a good doctor to fulfill her father's dream
 patrkaar prashanth kanaujia kaa maamla supreme court pahunch gaya he
 a hearing on this will be held on Tuesday, but it will not be easy to prove the charge against Kanaujia in this case
 supreme court main sunwaayee hone vaali hai or adaalat upi sarkaar or police se is maamle par ahm sawaal karegi lekin in sawaalon ke jabaav dene aasaan nahin honge kyonki police kai dhaaraon ke tahat aanan-fanan main exiaar darj kar kathith rup se bina warrant ke prashanth ko dilli se upi kii rajdhani lakhanu le gai
 This raises many questions
 dhaaraon par patni ne uthaae sawaliske alaava kanoon kii jin dhaaraon ke khilaaf prashanth ko giraftaar kiya gaya he un par supreme court main prashanth kii patni jigisha aroda ne habius corpus yani bandi pratyakshikaran yachika daakhil kar kai sawaal uthaae hai
 Prominent among these questions are IPC i
e
 Section 500 of Indian Penal Code and Section 66 and 67 of IT Act
 jigisha kaa kahana he ki iti act kii dhara 66 ke praavdhaan in post ke maamle main lagu nahin hote kyonki kisi tarah kii koi ashleelata yaa bhadakaane vaali saamagree isamen nahin he
 If the government also proves it in court, then there is a maximum sentence of three years under this section, so he can be released on bail
 iske alaava ipisi kii dhara 500 or 505 ke tahat prashanth ne kisi tarah kii dharmik yaa jaateey bhavanaaen bhadakaakar logon ko uksaaya nahin or na hi koi afvaah failaai he
 Arrested without a warrant, no arrest warrant or FIR was shown by those who picked Prashanth from his house in Mandavali in plain veneer, claiming himself to be an officer of Uttar Pradesh police
 dilli kii kisi adaalat main pesh kiye bina or bagaiyr kisi transit remand ke duusare pradesh main police kaise le gai, ye bhi ek bada sawaal he
 In many similar cases, the government has already shared the objectionable post against CM Yogi Adityanath on social media, but in similar cases, before now, Priyanka Sharma, the girl who shared the cartoon of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, is also like Action was taken
 aise maamle main supreme court ne usee din sunwaayee kar use reeha karne or maafinama likhavane kii shart lagaakar maamla nipta diya tha
 Earlier in Mumbai too, two girls shared similar posts, so the governments there took action and put the accused in jail
 lekin adaalaton ke dakhal ke baad sarkaron ne sabko choda tha
 In the same case, the government was also castigated on the arrest of cartoonist Aseem Trivedi
 aakhirkaar sabhi sarkaron ne un aropiyon ko reeha kiya kyonki satta ke aarope or gol mol daleelein adaalat kii choukhat par tikhe or sidhe sawaalon ke aage tik nahin pain
 Now the big question is that in the case of Prashant Kanaujia, is it going to be the same fate of the UP government and the police administration? dilli se sate upi ke noida main ek baar phir police kii badmaashon ke saath muthbhed ho gai
 During this, the police nabbed the vicious prize crook Satendra
 muthbhed main badmaash ke paanv main goli lagane se vah ghayal ho gaya

 India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday requested his teammates not to be influenced by the media's massive publicity about the great match against Pakistan and to focus their attention on the match
 dhoni kaa kahana he ki team india ke sabhi sadsy buudhvaar ko hone vaale cricket vishwa cap ke semifinal mukaable ke liye puri tarah se feet hai
 The Indian captain said that there is always a lot of media hype about indo-pak cricket matches and it is important for the players not to let their attention get distracted from the match without being influenced by this promotion
 dhoni ne match se purv mangalvaar ko kaha, ham jaanate hai ki bharat-pakistan maichon kaa kis tarah kaa prachaar hota he
 We are not going to join it
 ham yah jaanane kii jarurat he ki hamen kya karne kii ummid he or usee par dhyaan dena he
 "it is all part of cricket and we have to accept it," he said
 lekin isamen shaamil nahin hona jaruri he
 We will have the biggest distinguished guests (prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani) to watch the match, we have to do our best
 yah puche jane par ki apni sarajameen par khel rahi bhartiya team kya atyadhik prachaar se prabhavit hogi to dhoni ne kaha, isse ham par asar nahin padane vaala he
 We all know that this is a big tournament and we have prepared a lot for it
 hamaari taiyaariyaan usee tarah kii hai, jis tarah hamane pichley kuch dinon main kii hai
 Dhoni is not too worried about his batting form and said that he is playing the ball well and he has not got opportunities to play big innings
 dhoni se jab khaas taur par poocha gaya ki kya captaini kaa dabaav unki ballebaaji ko prabhavit kar rahaa he, to unhone kaha, yah keval cricket kaa najariya he, iskaa form se koi matlab nahin he
 i have batted very well
 kai baar aisi sthitiyaan nahin hotin, jab aap dhuandhar cricket khel saken
 There was a situation like this in the match against Bangladesh, but i did not get to bat
 unhone kaha, agar aap paanchaven, chathe yaa saatven number par ballebaaji kar rahe hai, to agar sheersh kram bada score banaata he, aise main aapako bahut zyada ballebaaji karne ko nahin milti
 i think the previous match (against Australia) was the norm, but the ball went straight into the fielder's hand
 sab kuch hameshaa aapke hisaab se nahin hota
 Form is not a matter of concern
 yah puche jane par ki kya team ke sabhi khilaadi feet hai, dhoni ne kaha, abhi sabhi khilaadi feet najar aa rahe hai
 Hope they stay fit
 dhoni se jab poocha gaya ki kya yah match bataur captain unka sabase bada muqabla he, to unhone kaha ki vah tulana karne main vishwaas nahin karte
 The Indian captain said, there are many occasions in the cricketer's life, there is no doubt that it is important
 kuch saal ke baad aap ise bhul jate hai
 i have forgotten how we were feeling before the semi-finals and finals in 2007 (twenty20 World Cup)
 teen saal biit chuke hai, har match alag he
 He said, this is a 50-over match, you have to do your best in it
 aapako match jeetne ke liye 100 over tak jajba barkaraar rakhana hota he
 He conceded that this bout would affect concentration, but i think how we can help bring about political change
 mujhe team kaa netritv karne kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he or main apni sarvshereshth kshamta se iskaa nirvaah karuunga
 Dhoni said that a team will eventually have to lose in the match, so fans need to take the result of this match with the right sportsmanship

 vahiin neha ne ab kaha he ki jab ve pregnent thim tab bollywood ne unase ekadam se munh pher liya
 Also, Neha said that after the birth of her daughter, she also faced body shaming
 pinkavila ke mutabiknehane kaha, 'pehali baat ki mujhe pataa he ki kaam aapke paas chalakar nahin aata
 Secondly, when you become a mother, this is an assumption
 maine pregnancy se pehle 'tumhaari sulu' film kii thi
 For this i also won the award
 lekin pregnancy ke baad mujhe filmon se judaa koi ofer nahin mila
 Right now i am in talks about a web show

 During this time, some senior officials warned him not to mention the turbulent south-western province of Balochistan, Pakistan
 samachar agency roitre kaa kahana he ki agast ke shuruaati dinon main hui ek baithak main varisht afasar or kai tejatarraar netaa maujuud the
 He had a different view on blaming Pakistan for the current situation in Kashmir
 isi par piem modi ne apni baat rakhi
 According to Reuters, an official, citing the sensitivity of the meeting, said on condition of anonymity that "bureaucrats had suggested that it is a good idea to talk about Balochistan, but Independence Day celebrations would not be a suitable place for it" 
 '' adhikari ke mutabik raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne ukt vichaar ko khaarij kar diya, haalanki grih mantri rajnath singh ne unka (parrikar) kaa samarthan yah kehete hue kiya ki hamen pakistan ko chup karaane ke liye sab kuch karnaa chahie
 Reuters wanted to know from the Ministry of External Affairs about the debate over Prime Minister Modi's speech, but he declined to comment
 raksha or grih mantralayon ne bhi tippanee ke liye anurodh kaa jawaab nahin diya
 Significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech on Red Fort on Independence Day said that the people of Balochistan are thanking him for bringing attention to the issue of human rights violations by the security forces of Pakistan
 pradhanmantri ne baluchistan kaa mudda tab uthaaya he jab kashmir main aatanki burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad ghati main ashaanti ko lekar pakistan bharat par kashmir ke aam nagarikon kaa daman karne kaa aarope laga rahaa he
 The comments ukt baithak main maujuud ek adhikari ne bataaya ki raksha mantri parrikar ne kathith taur par kaha ki modi baluchistan ke mudde ko uthaane ke saath kshetra main ashaanti ke liye china kii bhoomika par bhi prakaash daalen
 Two senior Indian officials told Reuters that Pakistan's new attempts to complain to the United Nations about Kashmir have disappointed Prime Minister Modi
 bhaajapa se jude ek adhikari ne kaha ki ''aatankwaad kaa saamana karnaa hamaara aantarik maamla he
 We will not accept interference from any other country
 '' News agency Reuters says that senior officials and several high-profile leaders were present at a meeting in early August
 ve kashmir ke taaja halaat ke liye pakistan ko dosha dene ke maamle main alag vichaar rakhte the
 On this, PM Modi made his point
 roitre ke anusaar ek adhikari ne is baithak kii samvedansheeltaa kaa hawala dete hue naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki ''naukarshahon ne suzav diya tha ki baluchistan ke bare main baat karnaa acha vichaar he, lekin swatantraaa diwas samaaroh iske liye upyukt jagah nahin hogi
 According to the official, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar rejected the said idea, although Home Minister Rajnath Singh supported his (parrikar) saying that we should do everything to silence Pakistan
 pradhanmantri modi ke bhaashan ko lekar hui bahes ke bare main roitre ne videsh mantralay se jaananaa chaha, par usne koi bhi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 The defense and home ministries also did not respond to requests for comment

 The Prime Minister has raised the issue of Balochistan when Pakistan is accusing India of suppressing ordinary citizens of Kashmir due to unrest in the valley following the killing of terrorist Burhan Wani in Kashmir
 tippaniyan An official present at the said meeting said that Defense Minister Parrikar reportedly said that Modi should raise the issue of Balochistan and also highlight China's role for unrest in the region

 The results of the assembly elections in four states have been completed
 chaar main se 3 rajyon-dilli, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main to congress kaa supada saaf ho gaya he, jabaki chhattisgarh main bhi bijepi ne hi baaji maari he
 Party sources insisted that Sonia Gandhi's decision not to hold any special function on her birthday had nothing to do with the results of the assembly elections
 divangat dakshin africa netaa ke sammaan main desh main shuukravaar se paanch dinon kaa rajkeey shok he
 Regardless of the reason behind not organizing the party on Sonia's birthday, the defeat of the Congress in the four states is definitely a problem for the Congress
 swayan congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ravivaar shaam lagbhag 5 baje media ke saamne aae or apni haar sweekaar kii
 After this, Sonia Gandhi said that after conducting a complete analysis of this defeat, necessary action will be taken
 sonia gandhi ne kaha, ‘shukriya
 Workers worked hard not only in the electoral state, but also in other states
 rashtriya str par baat karen to intress kii jarurat he
 We have to investigate all the reasons why we lost the election
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki hamaara sandesh logon tak kyon nahin pahunchaa
 Will have to see where there was a shortfall in the organization, in terms of elections
 ’sonia gandhi ne yah bhi kaha, ‘haar kii bahut sari vajahen hongi
 People are unhappy
 varna is tarah ke nattejey kyon aate
 Inflation was an issue that affected people
 rajasthan main hamen laga ki gahalot ne kuch bahut achche kaarykram chalaae
 But now there is question mark
 dilli main ham teen baar sarkaar main rahe
 Did a great job
 magar logon ne kuch or hi bataaya
 We will introspect and take steps to correct the mistake
 ’haalanki sonia gandhi ne apane kaaryakartaaon ko tasalli dene ke liye yah bhi kaha ki loksabhaa ke chunaav alag hote hai, isliye vidhansabha ke in parinaamon se ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Sonia said, 'lok Sabha elections are very different
 log rajya ke chunaav main vyaktitatv or rajya ke netaaon par focus karte hai
 In the general election, people see the person who will lead the country
 mudde bhi kuch alag hote hai

 For this reason, worshiping on Nag Panchami will remove the problems of job business, health, etc
, do away with health problems on Nag Panchami - Wake up early in the morning on Nag Panchami and wear a clean cloth after bathing - water in a steel lotus Fill and put two drops of Ganga water in it and put fresh Kusha leaves - sitting on a pedestal praying for a person who is ill, take water in his hand and resolve When you reach the temple of Lord Shiva, sit on a pedestal and chant the Namah Shivaya Mantra 108 times - and offer this water on the Shivling with a stream - in your mind pray to Lord Shiva for the sick person, what to do on Nag Panchami What not to do and what precautions to take- Panchami Tithi of Shukla Paksha is Purna Tithi, coincidentally on this day being Monday and Nag Panchami increases the importance of this day - if possible, say this day Do not dig the ground even on the ground and protect the small animals Try - If the sick animals can get to the birds, then try to bring them to the hospital - and offer pure material to Lord Shiva in the pooja lesson, how to recite the Shri Sarpa Sukta so that you can get the great boon - recite Sri Sarpasukta on the Nagpanchami of the month of Shravan
 It is considered very important - on the day of Nag Panchami, in the morning or evening, by laying a one and a quarter meter white cloth on a plate, a picture of Lord Shiva or Nag is placed
 Worship practices in-oil lamp burn and Roly Molly Rice sunny flourishing sweets etc

 loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke vijay rath ko jharkhand main rokane ke liye congress ke netritv main jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) jharkhand vikaas morcha (jeviem) or rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ne milakar mahagathbandhan banaaya
 Despite this, the BJP had to face a bitter defeat
 ab chand maheenon ke baad hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle mahagathbandhan bikharata hua najar aa rahaa he
 The Congress, JMM and JVM, the three major partners of the Grand Alliance in the state, are chanting their respective ragas, so there is doubt about their long stay together
 jharkhand main loksabhaa chunaav kii haar se abhi mahagathbandhan baahar bhi nahin nikal paaya ki uske andar vivaad kii jameen taiyaar hone lagi he
 The Congress is brainstorming to review the losses in the state and assess the profit and loss from the alliance
 soobe main mahagathbandhan banane ke baad bhi congress mahaj ek loksabhaa seat jeet saki or use 15
 63 percent votes were received
 congress ne maangi reportjharkhand ke congress prabharee arpyen singh ke netritv main pichley dinon party ke jila adhyakshon kii baithak hui
 After this, a report has been sought for whether there is an alliance for the upcoming assembly elections in the state
 15 din ke andar apane-apane kshetra kii jamini hakeekat taiyaar kar report saunpny he
 After this, the Congress will decide whether it will follow the path of 'ekla Chalo' or whether it will enter the electoral fray on the formula of alliance
 kya chaahati he jharkhand mukti morchajabaki, jharkhand mukti morcha loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj ek seat jeet saki thi or use 11
 51 percent votes were received
 ab jeemem adhyaksh hemanth sorain vidhansabha chunaav ke liye sahyogi dalon ke saath abhi se hi seat shering kaa formula tay kar lenaa chaahate hai
 JMM is seeking 40 seats out of 81 assembly seats in Jharkhand
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jeemem 19 siten jiti thi
 The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha in alliance is the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha as the third partner in the alliance, which is confused about the jmm's leadership in the assembly elections
 sutron kii maane to jeviem ke adhyaksh purv mukhyamantri babulal marandi kisi bhi surat main hemanth sorain ke netritv main chunavi maidan main nahin utarana chaahate hai, kyonki unhen lagata he ki kisi ko project kar chunaav ladane se gathbandhan ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Screws are stuck on many seats
 Screws are also stuck due to seat sharing between the alliance
 pradesh kii ghatshila, gandeya, jamtada, panki or vishrampur vidhansabha seat aisi hai, jahaan jeemem or congress donon kii baraabar kii daavedaari he
 In such a situation, it is difficult to agree on these seats
 iske alaava santhal pargana kii kai siten hai jahaan jeemem or jeviem ke bich maamla ulajhaa hua he
 Also, the Congress and JVM will have to agree on Hatia assembly seat
 kendriya road transport or haive ministar nitin gadakari ne kaha ki jiesti ke jariye ham arthvyavastha ko number-ek par laa rahe hai or isse bijness main number-do kaa kaam karne vaale khatm honge
 Gadkari was answering Anjana Om Kashyap's questions in the GST Ride on Tax Highway, the fifth season of the GST Conclave
 gadakari ne jiesti se mahangaai badhane ke andeshe ko khaarij kiya or kaha ki jin chizon par 28 fisadi tex laga he unamem pehle ye dekhnaa hoga ki ab tak un par 17 tex or 22 fisadi ses milakar kul kitna tex lagata tha
 If there is a lot of difference between the two, then it can be said that with GST, that thing will be expensive
 gadakari ne kaha ki hammediake dabaav main kaam nahin karenge, kisi sector ke dabaav main kaam nahin karenge
 The merchant brothers stay for two months
 agar takalif ai to hamaare paas aaen
 This is the beginning
 hamaari bhi agar koi galati hogi to sudhaarenge
 Gadkari said that the states have difficulty in bringing coprol, diesel and liquor under the purview of GST, but i believe that if these things also come under the purview of GST, then the states will get more than what they get now
 gadakari ne kaha ki jiesti ke jariye sarkaar ne 17 tex or 22 ses cancil kiye hai
 Inspector used to trouble each one, no one is talking about the relief that is being received from him
 gadakari ne khaane kii packed chizon par tex badhane ke mudde par kaha ki desh kaa loar middle class or loar class packed food istemaal nahin karata
 It is the higher middle class that uses it
 isliye garib aadmi kii thali par jiesti koi negative asar daalegi aisa kahana sahi nahin hoga
 Gadkari said that we want foreign investment but in sectors where we are not ourselves like Infrastructure
 hamen mek in india, maid in india ko bhi dekhnaa he or desh kii companiyon ko badhaava dena he jo ki kahin se bhi galat nahin he
 On the issue of boycotting today's program of Congress and some other parties, Gadkari said that some things cannot be tolerated and cannot be spoken
 ham logon ne acha kaam kiya to congress tarif to kar nahin sakati
 He should understand that GST is not just the product of BJP and NDA nor is it the agenda of any one party
 ye deshhit main he, kuch log raajnneetik rup se berozegaar hue hai isliye unki majaburi he virodh karnaa, unhen chhod dena chahie

 After the incident came to light, the police has now registered a case against 12 people, including the accused youth and members of the panchayat, and the administration has assured the accused to take strict action
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke nateezon ne sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke tamaam siyaasi sapanom ko chakanachur kar diya he
 Using the alliance with the Congress in 2017 and with the BSP in 2019 has proved wrong for them
 akhilesh ke netritv main sapa ek baar phir usee mukaam par khadi dikhaai de rahi he, jahaan 27 saal pehle unke pita mulaayam singh yadav ne party kii neenv rakhkar shuruyaat kii thi
 This is the reason why leaving behind the shock of defeat, Akhilesh Yadav has got down on the land of the state and is busy in the exercise of changing his image
 loksabhaa chunaav main basapa se gathbandhan ke baad sapa shandaar pradarshan ke liye puri tarah aashwast thi, lekin gathbandhan kaa ganit aisa dhwast ho gaya ki sapa ab tak ke sabase kharaab daur main pahunch gai
 After this defeat, the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav has started to be questioned
 party ke netaa dabi jubaan se basapa ke saath gathbandhan karne se lekar seat shering tak par baat kar rahe hai to unke virdohi khulkar chutki le rahe hai
 On the condition of anonymity, a senior SP leader said that Akhilesh Yadav was completely cut off from the ground and was sitting in Lucknow and dreaming of winning the election battle through social media
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki chunaav main party kaa aadhaar puri tarah se khisak gaya
 Apart from this, Akhilesh Yadav is surrounded by leaders without base
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar or basapa supremeo mayawati ke dwaara sawaal khadey kiye jane ke baad akhilesh yadav ne apni image ko badalane kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 Akhilesh has started going to the public to get back his lost political land
 is kadi main unhone pehle gajipur main sapa jila panchayat sadsy vijay yadav urf pappu ke pariwaron se mulaakaat kii
 Vijay Yadav was assassinated after the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad akhilesh yadav ne barabanki main jahrili sharaab se marane vaale logon ke parijanon se unke ghar jaakar mulaakaat kii or unhen santvanaa di
 After this, while returning to Lucknow, Akhilesh Yadav's convoy reached Kesripur railway crossing in Ramnagar area, his convoy suddenly stopped seeing a person selling Bhutta on a road cart
 akhilesh ne thele vaale se bhutte kii kism poochhate hue kaha ki aakhir yah bhutta kahaan kaa he thele vaale ne jawaab diya ki baharich kaa he
 On this Akhilesh Yadav said that it is sweet and you are selling it for how much
 thele vaale ne badi vinamrata se jawaab diya ki haa meetha he or das rupee main ise bench rahaa hum
 Akhilesh told Tapak that you are paying very expensive and if it is not sweet, it will not be returned
 phir akhilesh ne usase ek bhutta liya or apni gaadi main baith kar khaane lage
 In fact, after the rage in Mulayam's family before the SP 2017 assembly elections, the organization also got divided into slaves at the lower level
 pichley do saal main yah khai paatane va inhen vishwaas main lene kii koi khaas koshish nahin kii gai
 All the old faces of the party also remained sidelined or inactive
 iskaa nuksaan chunaav main hua
 Therefore, now the preparations are on to fix the land by advancing the loyal faces of the organization in every district
 akhilesh khud jilon main pahunch kaaryakartaaon kii apeksha or shikayaton donon ko samajhenge, uske aadhaar par aage kii ranneeti banaaenge
 This is the reason that instead of churning after the defeat, Akhilesh Yadav is going to land on his own and reach the victims' home as a strategy to change his image so that he is not seen to be confined to Lucknow and that public for the Assembly elections due in 2022 To reach between bataate chalem ki 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle akhilesh yadav ne puure pradesh kii cycle se yatra kii thi
 After this campaign, he not only aroused enthusiasm among the activists but also defeated his bsp's social engineering and gave his party a landslide victory
 iske saath hi vah apane pita or purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav kii raajnneetik viraasat ke uttaradhikari bhi bane the

 com / 9xhl4fnpmf In Jharkhand, the crowd is becoming a court
 kabhi dharm ke naam par kisi dharm ke kilaaf to kabhi kisi ke bhi kilaaf
 Somewhere Haleem and Naeem were killed by the mob, and somewhere Gautam Kumar and Gangesh Kumar were also killed by the mob
 kya aisa ho saktaa he ki koi samooh yah test kar rahaa ho ki alag alag afvaahon ke kaaran bheed kisi ko maar sakati he yaa nahin
 Sometimes this crowd is being formed in the name of a cow, so now it is being heard that the child is being made in the name of theft
 is sawaal par gambhirtha se sochaa janaa chahie ki whatsap par group banaakar afvaah banane vaale kya yah test kar rahe hai ki log vaaki kitne murkh hai, or unhen kin kin masalon main bheed ke bhed kii tarah haank kar hatyare main badla ja saktaa he
 The administration also seems helpless in front of such a crowd
 kuch to he ki na prashasan is bheed kii raajnneeti ko samaj rahaa he na hi samaaj or na hi raajnneeti
 If there is an incident of child theft in Jharkhand, then it is the job of the police to catch or crowd will kill anyone on suspicion
 haal philhal main jharkhand main aisi kai ghatnaayen ho gai hai
 Saraikala is a Kharsawan district in Jharkhand
 yahaan ke rajnagar main subah subah baccha chori ke andeh main chaar logon ko peet peet kar maar diya gaya
 All were Muslims and were businessmen
 bheed kaa hausala dekhiye ki chaaron kii hatya alag alag jagahon par le jaakar kii gai
 One was killed in Shobhapur, the other was found in Dandu, the third person's body in Sosomali village, while the fourth person's body was found in the forest of Dhobo Dungri
 haldeepokhar nivasee shaikh haleem, mohammad naeem, sajaad or siraaj raat do baje rajnagar kii taraf ja rahe the
 Suddenly his car was tried to stop
 dar kar pados ke gaanv main rishtedaar ke ghar chale gaye
 But the crowd also reached there, directly threatening to hand it over to everyone else or else the whole house would be set on fire
 chaaron ko bheed apane saath le gai or phir hatya kar di
 Where are people coming from so much courage that they take someone out of the house and surround them and kill them wherever they want
 is kaam main ham sirf marane vaale ko dekhte hai, yah nahin dekhte ki is bheed kii raajnneeti main hamaare noujvaan hatyare ho rahe hai
 Anees Khan, senior journalist of Hindustan newspaper, told the information by talking to the people there, it is really dangerous
 baccha chori kii afvaah ko lekar watsap group banaaya gaya, phir yuvakon kii toli banaai gai or baccha chori kii baat failaai jane lagi
 This can be the root of this problem, is there any group who is testing through different rumors whether the mob can surround and kill anyone
 abhi tak ham ise is rup me dekhte rahe hai ki bheed ne musalamaanon ko gher kar maar diya lekin gautam kumaar verma, vikaas kumaar verma or unke dost gangesh kumaar bhi is bheed ke shikaar hue hai
 The incident occurred on the night of 18 May
 bagbeda ke nagadih gaanv main baccha chori ke aarope main jugslai ke gautam kumaar verma, vikaas kumaar verma or uske dost gangesh kumaar kii peet-petakar hatya kar di gai
 Not only this, 65-year-old Ramchandra Devi was beaten badly
 inaki haalat gambhir he
 Gautam and Vikas are real brothers
 unke tasire bhai uttam ko bhi bheed ne pakad liya tha, lekin wo bachakar bhaagane main kaamyaab rahe
 Uttam told that the mob questioned him and suddenly he was attacked saying that he was a child thief
 jharkhand ke saare akhabaaron in khabaron se bhare pade hai
 It is from this that Gautam and Vikas were first tied to electric poles and beaten
 vahaan aasapaas ke gaanv ke log badi sankhya main jamaa hue the
 Surprisingly, such a large number of people are gathering but no one has stopped
 thanedaar sahab saadhe aath baje pahunche, bheed ko samajhane kii koshish kii, lekin ulta police par bhi hamalaa kiya gaya
 The SHO was injured
 aakhir raat 10 baje city espi pahunche, tab jaakar karrwai shuru hui
 By then, Gautam Vikas and Gangesh had been killed
 kuch to he jise ab nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 We must see what pattern this crowd is building, who is creating the crowd
 sirf baccha chori kii afvaah ke zariye nahin, balki tarah tarah ke aarope lagaakar bhi bheed ne kanoon apane haath main liya he or hatya kii he
 Our colleague Harivansh said that such cases are increasing in Jharkhand
 isamen zyadatar sankhya musalamaanon kii bhi he lekin bheed ne duusare samudaay ko bhi nahin choda he
 In Kolhan division which has five districts, 8 people have been killed
 agar puure jharkhand kii baat karen to ab tak afawaah ke naam par 18 logon kii hatya kii gai
 Last month in Bokaro, Shamsuddin was thrashed by a mob and died while undergoing treatment at the hospital
 tippaniyan 2 May 2017: a 60-year-old man was murdered in Dumaria in a similar manner 2 may : jaadoogoda ke eusil bairaj ke paas jon anthony kii pitayee kii gai May 2: An unidentified person badly beaten up as a child thief in Galudih 1 may : asanabani talab ke paas mohammad aseem kii hatya, usee din rakha mins stesan ke paas saddaam ansaari urf chotu kii pitayee Sudhir Singh was beaten to death near Putudu village in Galudih

 pradarshnakariyon ne jugslai railway phatak ke paas sadak ko jam kar diya or vaahanon ke avaagaman ko rokkar prashasan ke khilaaf jamkar narebaazi kii
 Police are repeatedly saying that the incident of child theft is not happening in the state
 jo bhi afvaah failaa rahaa he, use pakadaney kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 The question is whether the police have awakened now when a mob of 8 people was murdered within a few hours
 saraayaklan kharasaavaan zila he jharkhand main
 Four people were beaten to death in the morning in Rajnagar here on suspicion of child theft
 sabhi musalmaan the or kaarobaari the
 See the courage of the crowd that all four were murdered by taking them to different places
 ek kii hatya shobhapur main, duusare kii dandu, tisare vyakti kaa shav sosomali gaanv main mila, jabaki chauthe vyakti kaa shav dhobo dungri ke jangal main mila
 Haldipokhar residents Sheikh Haleem, Mohammad Naeem, Sajjad and Siraj were going towards Rajnagar at 2 pm
 achaanak unki car rokane kii koshish kii gai
 Fearing, he moved to a relative's house in the neighboring village
 lekin bheed vahaan bhi pahunchi, sidhi dhamkee di gai kii sabko saunp do nahin to puure ghar ko aag laga denge
 The four took the mob with them and then murdered
 itani himmat logon main kahaan se aa rahi he ki ve kisi ko ghar se nikaal kar le jate hai or jahaan chaahate hai vahaan gher kar maar dete hai
 In this work, we only see the dead, do not see that in this mob politics our youth are becoming killers
 hindustan akhbaar ke varisht patrkaar anis khan ne jo jaankaree vahaan logon se baat kar bataai wo vaaki khataranaak he
 The whatsapp group was formed on the rumor of child theft, then a group of youths were formed and the issue of child theft started spreading
 yahi is samasya kii jad ho sakati he, kya koi group he jo alag alag afvaahon ke zariye yah test kar rahaa he ki bheed kisi ko gher kar maar sakati he yaa nahin
 Till now we have seen it as a mob that surrounded Muslims and killed them but Gautam Kumar Verma, Vikas Kumar Verma and his friend Gangesh Kumar have also fallen victim to this mob
 yah ghatana 18 may kii raat kii he
 Gautam Kumar Verma of Jugasalai, Vikas Kumar Verma and his friend Gangesh Kumar were beaten to death in Nagadih village of Bagbeda on charges of child theft
 yahi nahin, 65 saal kii ramchandra devi kii buree tarah pitayee kii gai
 His condition is critical
 gautam or vikaas sage bhai hai
 His third brother Uttam was also caught by the mob, but he managed to escape
 uttam ne hi bataaya ki bheed ne unase poochtacha kii or achaanak baccha chor kii baat kahkar unpar hamalaa bol diya gaya
 All the newspapers of Jharkhand are full of these news
 inhen se pataa chalata he ki gautam or vikaas ko pehle bijli ke khambhe se baandhakar peeta gaya
 People from nearby villages had gathered there in large numbers
 hairaani kii baat he ki itani badi sankhya main log jute rahe magar kisi ne roka nahin
 Thanedar Sahab arrived at half past eight, tried to convince the crowd, but was also attacked by the police
 thanedaar ghayal ho gaye
 Finally reached the city SP at 10 o'clock, then the action started
 tab tak gautam vikaas or gangesh kii hatya ho chuki thi
 There is something that can no longer be ignored
 hamen dekhnaa hi chahie ki yah bheed kis pattern par ban rahi he, koun he jo bheed bana rahaa he
 Not only through rumors of child theft, but also by making various allegations, the mob has taken the law into their own hands and committed murder
 hamaare sahyogi harivansh ne bataaya ki jharkhand main lagaataar aise maamle badhate ja rahe he
 Most of the Muslims are also in it, but the crowd has not left the other community
 kolhan pramandal jisamen paanch zile hai, vahaan 8 logon kii hatya ho chuki he
 If we talk about the whole of Jharkhand, so far 18 people have been murdered in the name of rumor
 pichley maheene bokaro main shamsuddin kii bheed ne pitayee kii or aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan unki maut ho gai
 The comments 2 may 2017 : dumriya main 60 saal ke buzurg kii isi tarah hatya kar di gai thi May 2: John Anthony is beaten up near Yusil Barrage of Jadugodara 2 may : galudih main baccha chor bataakar ek agyaat vyakti kii buree tarah pitayee May 1: Mohammad Aseem killed near Asanbani pond, beating Saddam Ansari alias Chhotu near Rakha Mines Station on the same day - galudih ke putadu gaanv ke paas sudhir singh kii peet-petakar hatya kar di gai

 The protesters blocked the road near the Jugasalai railway gate and shouted slogans against the administration, stopping the movement of vehicles
 police baar baar kah rahi he ki baccha chori kii ghatana rajya main nahin ho rahi he
 Whoever is spreading the rumor, attempts are being made to catch it
 sawaal he ki kya police ab jaagi he jab chand ghanton ke bheetar 8 logon kii bheed ne hatya kar di
 Where are people coming from so much courage that they take someone out of the house and surround them and kill them wherever they want
 is kaam main ham sirf marane vaale ko dekhte hai, yah nahin dekhte ki is bheed kii raajnneeti main hamaare noujvaan hatyare ho rahe hai

 smriti ke bayaan kaa congress netaa anand sharma ne virodh kiya or kaha ki unhone jo maa durga kaa apmaan kiya he uske liye wo maafee maangen
 In response to this, Smriti Irani said that the form i read in Rajya Sabha was not from the government but jnuka

 vipaksh ne modi sarkaar par court parisar menkanhaiya se marpitke aaropee vakeelon or bijepi vidhayak opi sharma ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 On the statement of Smriti Irani, the Minister of Human Resource Development Smriti Irani again took the front on Thursday

 Smriti Irani, referring to the JNU case, said that objectionable posters were put up about Mother Durga and Mahishasura there

 The proceedings were adjourned for the day amidst the uproar

 What is domestic violence after all? Every violence within the boundary falls under the category of domestic violence
 do logon ke bich jab pyaar, sammaan or sahanubhuti kii bhaavana samaapt hokar nafrat or krurta main tabdeel ho jaati he to wo gharelu hinsa ban jaati he
 It can be of all three types, physical, sexual and behavioral
 aise main ye jaananaa behad jaruri ho jaataa he ki gharelu hinsa ke kya-kya kaaran ho sakate hai
 On the basis of statistics, most cases take the form of domestic violence due to the position, money and other material comforts in the house
 kai baar badale kii bhaavana bhi ise janm dene kaa kaam karti he
 Domestic violence is a crime, but most of the cases related to it do not come up
 kai baar ghar-parivaar ke dar se to kai baar samaaj main izzat khone ke dar se log ise jaahir nahin hone dete hai
 In such a situation, the victim keeps getting tortured and the one who is suffering continues to commit his vandalism
 relationships se jude maamalon ke visheshgyon kii maane to beete kuch samay main is tarah ke maamalon main kaaphi teji ai he
 Experts believe that things get to this point only after mutual trust and love between partners is over
 gharelu hinsa ke prabhaav:gharelu hinsa ke prabhaavon kaa zikr karne se pehle ye baat samaj lenaa bahut jaruri he ki parivaar samaaj kii ikai he or agar parivaar main kalah he to iskaa sidhaa asar samaaj par padegaa
 In most cases, women are the victims of domestic violence, but it is not so that the male class is untouched by it
 1
 a person who has been victim of domestic violence is never able to come out of his fear
 If a person has faced domestic violence in his life, it is very difficult for him to come out of this fear
 lagaataar hinsa kaa shikaar hone ke baad uski soch main nakaaratmakataa is kadar haaavee ho jaati he ki use apane ko sthir karne main saalon lag jate hai
 2
 maansik aghat insaan ko bheetar se todakar rakh detaa hagharelu hinsa kaa ek sabase bura pahalu ye he kiiskaa peedit maansik aghat se baahar nahin aa paata he
 It is often seen in such cases that people either lose their mental balance or fall prey to depression
 3
 This is such a pain that hardly anyone has medicine, in such cases, including physical torture, the victim has to suffer immense pain
 kai maamalon main shaareerik asamarthta kii bhi sthiti aa jaati he yaa phir koi ang hi kaam karnaa band kar detaa he
 In addition, there are some injuries that prove to be fatal
 4
 The victim reaches a state of psychosis
 This is the most dangerous and tragic aspect of domestic violence
 jin logon par ham itnaa bharosa karte hai or jinke saath rahete hai jab vahi apane is tarah kaa dukh dete hai to insaan kaa rishton par se bharosa uth jaataa he or wo khud ko akelaa bana letaa he
 He somewhere decides that he has no one in this world and he will have to live on his own
 kai baar is sthiti main log aatmahatya bhi kar lete hai
 In such a situation, it is very important to neither encourage domestic violence nor become its victim
 kisi bhi prakaar kii gharelu hinsa, hinsa hi he or uske khilaaf aawaaj uthaanaa jaruri he
