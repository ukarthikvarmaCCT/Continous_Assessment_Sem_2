 Children are crazy about video games
 computer ho yaa smartphone bacchon ko bas video game chahie
 Alam is that if any child sees your phone, then his question is, 'do you have video games on your phone?' Video games are of many types but children of action genre games are very fond of them
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki hinsak video games kaa bacchon ke man par bahut gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 Playing more video games has a very bad effect on the hearts and minds of the children, which affects their whole thinking and they inadvertently start accepting violence and crime as normal
 aise marijon ke liye blad bank kaa khun ho saktaa he khatarnakayahi nahin isse sharir par bhi bura asar padataa he
 Children sit in front of the computer for hours playing video games
 isse dry ai kii pareshaani hoti he
 The way children sit while playing games is not correct, leading to complaints of neck and back pain
 ghanto game khelte rahane ke dauraan bachche kuch naa kuch khate rahete hai
 This increases obesity in children and due to reduced physical activity, their physical development is also affected
 tuutane ke baad dobaaraa nahin aati neend? karen ye kamboote bacchon kaa man ek kaagaj kii tarah hota he, vah jo bhi dekhte hai, vaisaa hi karne lagate hai
 Most games are full of violence
 in sabhi games main sirf mardhaad hi he
 This increases the tendency of violence in children
 isliye bacchon ko zyada samay tak video games khilne se roka janaa chahie taaki ve koi galat kadam naa uthaa len

 She says' My father Sanjar Manjrekar went to meet Salman Khan at his house

 When i met Salman, i was feeling very hungry, then Salman offered me a lot of chocolate

 bombai hai court ne shanivaar ko apane aadesh main kaha ki skool main teachers ko prarthana ke dauraan haath jodne yaa samvidhan kii prastaavna kii shapath lete samay haath aage karne ke liye vivash nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Hearing on October 29 on a petition filed on behalf of a teacher who professes Buddhism, a bench of judges Abhay Oka and Revathi Mohiti Dhere said that forcing a teacher to do so would be a violation of the fundamental rights enjoyed by him under the Constitution 
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki yachikakarta skool main din kii shuruyaat main hone vaali prarthana ke dauraan skool ke anushaasan se bandhaa he, lekin use apane haath jodne ke liye vivash nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Petitioner Sanjay Salve works as a teacher at Matoshree Savitribai Phule Secondary School in Nashik, Western Maharashtra
 skool prashasan ne jab yah paaya ki sanjay subah kii prathana ke samay khadey hote samay haath nahin jodate or shapath lete samay apana haath aage nahin karte, tab ‘anushaasanheenata’ kaa hawala dete hue unhen hair selary dene se manaa kar diya
 However, this teacher's argument was that he stands with others at the time of prayer and as such he has not done any disrespect
 unka kahana tha ki ye prathanaayen dharmik hai or is vajah se unhone apane haath nahin jode
 With this, while taking the oath of the Preamble of the Constitution, he stood with other teachers and participated in this practice, but did not put forward his hand

 Oh weak Gautam, he and his attitude have been a problem

 nae motor whical act ke khilaaf united front of transport association hadtaal kar rahi he
 Due to this, people can face problems in many places including delhi-ncr
 agar aap bhi kahin ja rahe hai or agar hadtaal kii vajah se aapako dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padaa rahaa he, to aap iske liye cese kar sakate hai or muaavje kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 In this regard, law professor Vivek Tyagi says that under the Industrial Dispute Act in India, the union has been given the legal right to strike
 haalanki yah moulik adhikaar nahin he
 This means that transport organizations do not have the fundamental right to strike
 yah sirf unka kanoonee adhikaar he, wo bhi kuch pratibandhon ke saath diya gaya he
 Law professor Vivek Tyagi also says that no organization can violate the fundamental rights of another person under the guise of strike
 agar hadtaal se kisi ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hota he, to vah hadtaal karne vaale sanghathan ke khilaaf samvidhan ke anuchhed 226 ke tahat hoicourt or anuchhed 32 ke tahat sidhe supreme court ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, notice has to be given in advance for the strike
 iske alaava immergency suvidhaon ko bhi nahin baadhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Advocate Rohit Srivastava in this case says that no organization or person can be arbitrary or sabotage or obstruct movement of anyone under the strike
 agar hadtaal karne vaale sanghathan kisi ko bina vajah pareshaan karte hai yaa hinsa failaate hai, to unke khilaaf civil or criminal donon cese kiye ja sakate hai
 The victim gets compensation for doing a civil case, while criminal action is taken against the strike organization and its members for the criminal case
 edwocket shrivastav kaa kahana he ki kanoon vyavastha, bharat kii samprabhutaa or kisi yah moulik adhikaron ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali hadtaal gaiyrkanoonee hoti he
 This means that an organization is not allowed to go on strike against law and order or sovereignty of India or fundamental rights of anyone
 gaiyrkanoonee yaa hinsak hadtaal ke khilaaf police khud bhi karrwai kar sakati he
 Apart from this, Advocate Shobhit Bhardwaj says that a strike can be done peacefully following the laws but if the common people face a lot of hardships due to the strike then a case can be made against such strike
 kai baar apni baat ko manwaane ke liye hadtaal kerani padati he
 However, the purpose of the strike should not be to disturb anyone
 khaskar isse aam logon ko zyada dikkat nahin honi chahie
 If a flywheel is jammed during a strike and people have problems, it can be considered illegal

 rudraksh kaa arth he rudra kaa aksh
 Kirudraksh is believed to have originated from the tears of Lord Shiva
 isko pracheen kaal se aabhushan ke rup main, mantra jaap ke liye tathaa grahon ko niyantrit karne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 With the use of Rudraksha, we can also overcome the pain of Saturn and get the grace of Shani
 parantu iske liye rudraksh dhaaran karne ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 What are the rules for wearing Rudraksha? - Rudraksha can be worn on the wrist, throat and heart
 ise kanth pradesh tak dhaaran karnaa sarvottam hoga
 - It should wear twelve in the wrist, thirty-six in the throat and one hundred and eight donations on the heart
 - ek dana bhi dhaaran kar sakate hai
 But this grain should be up to the heart and should be in red thread
 - sawan main somvaar ko or shivaratri ke din rudraksh dhaaran karnaa sarvottam hota he
 - Before wearing Rudraksha, he should dedicate it to Shiva and chant the mantra on the same rosary or Rudraksha
 - jo log bhi rudraksh dhaaran karte hai, unhen satvik rahanaa chahie tathaa aacharan ko shuddh rakhana chahie anyathaa rudraksh laabhakaari nahin hoga
 Which Rudraksha should be used to deal with the obstacles of Saturn? For problems in employment - for this, you should wear ten Mukhi Rudraksha
 - ise shanivaar ko laal dhaage main gale main dhaaran karen
 - Wearing three, ten Mukhi Rudraksha together will be especially beneficial
 swasthya yaa aayu kii samasya ke liye-- iske liye shanivaar ko gale main aath mukhi rudraksh dhaaran karen
 - Either wear only one eight Mukhi Rudraksha
 - yaa ek saath chauvan rudraksh pahanen
 To remove any inauspicious yoga of Saturn in the horoscope - put one face and eleven faces of Rudraksha together
 - isamen ek-ek mukhi or do, gyaarah mukhi rudraksh rakhen
 - Put it together in red thread

 " Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said, "now that Sonia Gandhi's visit to the state and expenditure on her treatment abroad has been proved wrong, Modi should apologize to the nation and the Gandhi family for this
 " Shukla said that the person, who had sought information about Sonia's foreign visit and expenditure on her treatment under the Right to Information (RTI), denied receiving any such information in a media interaction and called Modi's figures incorrect

 The Real Estate (regulation and Development) Act 2016 was finally published in the Gazette of the Government of India on 26 March after waiting for many years
 isse pehle sansad ke donon sadanon main yah paarit hua or isane sansad main sattadhari or vipakshi dalon ko ek raay hone kaa mauka bhi diya
 But the biggest thing from this political unity is that those who buy flats or houses in cities will now be less victim of rigging than ever before
 apni gadhi kamai se makaan book karne ke baad puri tarah builder ke rahamokaram par aa jane kaa daur khatm hoga
 And perhaps for the first time, the real estate business that thrives on a large portion of the country's middle-class lifetime earnings will work under the supervision of a better regulator
 adhinium par najar daalen to sabase pehle kuch khaas baton par dhyaan jaataa he
 Under the Act, every state government will have to set up the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) within a year
 real estate se judaa sara bada kaam is athurity kii nigaraanee main chalegaa
 For example, now a builder will not be able to raise his face and start booking big advertisements and flats directly
 yah kaam karne se pehle use athurity main panjikaran karana hoga
 Registration will be done only when it communicates all necessary clearances to the authority
 yah sara kaam online kiya jayega
 The builder will also have to tell the authority by when the project will be completed
 agar tay samay par graahak ko makaan nahin miltaa to makaan book karne vaale ko may byaaj ke rakam waapas lene kaa adhikaar hoga
 Apart from this, the builder will also have to face penalty or penalty fixed by the authority
 to, kya ye chijen aam aadmi ko raahat dengi
 Who can understand this question better than thousands of people who have booked flats in Noida Extension (now Greater Noida West), which has been the victim of most controversies in the National Capital Region (NCR)
 yahaan book kiye gaye hajaaron makaanon kaa pajeshan tay samay seemaa se teen se chaar saal tak peeche chal rahaa he
 The pressure of the people suffering here has also played a big role behind the framing of a new law
 chah saal pehle makaan book karne ke baad ab tak pajeshan ke liye bhatak raheen shweta bharti, apni hi tarah ke peedit logon kii sanstha noida ekstansion flats oners welfare association kii mahasachiv hai
 Shweta remembers how the then Urban Development Minister Ajay Maken heard the suggestions of those people when the work on this bill started in the era of the UPA government
 iske baad vidheyak par manthan karne vaali sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne in logon ke suzav liye or shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu ne bhi peedit logon se baatcheet kii, taaki aisa kanoon bane jo doorgaami hone ke saath hi vakti jaruraton par bhi khara utre
 Shweta says, "after a long battle, hope is raised with this law
" kam se kam athurity ke rup main ek jagah to aisi hogi, jahaan flats or builder se judi sari baaten or shikaayatein kii ja sakengi
 "though he is not yet clear whether this law will apply regarding his own flat? In fact, the Act states that this law will apply to the projects which are pending till the time the Act comes into force
" duusari taraf athurity ke gathan ko ek saal kii samay seemaa di gai he
 In such a situation, in practice the law will be applicable only when the concerned states constitute the authority
 lekin in shuruaati nukton se itar, dur kii raah behatar bataai ja rahi he
 Manoj Gaur, president of the builders' organization CREDAI NCR, sees this as the beginning of a new era of transparency in the real estate business
 gaur ne kaha, ''eemaandaaree se kaam karne vaale developers ke liye yah kanoon bahut acha he
 Initially the situation regarding RIRA is not very clear, but the same was the situation when SEBI was formed for the stock market
 aaj sebi ne sansthagat niveshkon or aam niveshak ko barabari par laakar khadaa kar diya he
 This law would eventually strengthen the home buyers and thus the entire business
 ''haalanki makaan book karaane waalon se lee gai 70 fisadi raashi ko develper ko alag bank account main jamaa karne kii bandish ko vah or spasht kiye jane kii jarurat mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, there is a provision in the law that 70% of the amount taken from customers for a project will have to be kept in a separate account by the developer
 is paise kaa istemaal project ke nirmaan or iske liye jameen kii kharid par hi kharch karnaa hoga
 Describing the provision as "very important", Pratunu Biswas, MD, grenowest Properties
com, says, "in many cases developers use the money they receive from customers for other projects or for other purposes
" is laalach main mul project ke liye paise kii kami pad jaati he
 By restricting the amount to the project, the developer will not have to run out of money for the project
 isse project samay par puraa karne main madad milegi
 "there is a provision in the new law that as the construction work of the project progresses, the developer can withdraw the amount in the same proportion
 aisa karne ke liye use sakasham ejiniyaron or architect se praaanpatr lenaa hoga
 In this way, it is the effort of the government that in every situation, the developer should invest the customer's money to build a house for him, rather than putting money in elections and other business
 lekin in sakht faislon ke bich is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa gaya he ki chote bilderon ko bahut zyada sakhti kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 That is why small developers who build 500 square meters plot or up to eight flats are exempted from registering with the authority
 in logon kaa kaam maujuuda vyavastha ke anusaar hi chalata rahegaa
 On the other hand, big builders are also seeing this law as the first step towards fulfilling their old demand
 real estate sector lambey samay se buniyadi dhaancha kshetra kaa darja dene kii maang kar rahaa tha, nae niamak ke aane ke baad us disha main pahal hogi
 But the biggest relief is to get those people whose hard earned money, many builders used to keep quiet and those who put money neither got a house nor money back
 kam se kam ab unke paas apana paisa vasuulne ke liye sidhi vyavastha to he
 Developers, on the other hand, hope that the slowdown in the real estate market will be overcome due to increased confidence

 On October 21, senior BJP leader LK Advani had just 20 minutes for the party's public meeting in Ranchi as he had to reach Andaman before 3 pm for the next leg of his Jan Chetna Yatra
 magar adwani 8 minute kaa apana bhaashan dene ke liye uth kar khadey ho pate, uske pehle unhone dekha ki unke paas kii kursi par asantusht netaa raghubar das baithe hue hai, us seat par jo mukhyamantri arjuna munda ke liye rakhi thi
 Regardless of the situation and the occasion, Raghubar Das gave Advani a local newspaper, which had a front page report on how the state's power factories were losing precious coal and oil
 urja vibhaag munda ke paas he, or raghubar das ke unke saath rishte na ke baraabar rah gaye hai or unhone is bare main shaq kii koi gunjaaish bhi nahin chodi thi ki unka nishaanaa kis par he
 Already, there was little interest in this type of absurd revelations of Advani, running late by an hour
 unhone akhbaar to le liya, lekin saath hi raghubar das ko is tarah asamay betuka raag alaapne ke liye jhdik bhi diya
 But the damage was done
 bhaajapa kii jharkhand ikai party ke sabase kaddavar netaa ke saamne ekajutata dikhaanaa chaahati thi, lekin bhari sabha main, ain tivi camaron ke saamne party kii dophaad sabake saamne aa gai
 In September 2010, former Deputy Chief Minister Raghubar Das had to leave the post of BJP Legislature Party leader for Munda
 or kaha jaataa he ki ve uske baad se hi gathbandhan sarkaar se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 The newspaper news failed to change Advani's mood
 munda sarkaar ko lekar ateet main rakhe gaye nishpaksh maun ke ulat bhaajapa ke pitrupurush ne munda kii tarifon kii jhdi laga di, ''arjuna sushasan rajya ko dene kii eemaandaaree se koshish kar rahe hai
 They are also using technology to get government services on time
 meraa aashirwad unke saath he
 Advani's words were a clear indication of a new change in his old attitude
 sitambar 2010 main munda sarkaar ke shapath grahan kaarykram main ve shaamil nahin hue the
 There were reports that he was not happy to form an alliance with the JMM
 yahaan tak ki haal main bhi bihar ke sitabadiara main nitish kumaar ke hari jhandi dikhaane ke baad se shuru hui apni yatra main bhi adwani jharkhand ko darkinar karte hue uttar pradesh main pravesh kar gaye the, jisase jharkhand kii gathbandhan sarkaar ke prati unki naaraazgi kii baton ko bal mila tha
 But Advani made up for it on Friday
 unhone mana ki jharkhand ke mukhyamantri prashansaneey kaam kar rahe hai or unka yah kaam rajya ko sakaaratmak vikaas kii ore le jayega
 This compliment was a lot for Munda
 isse abhibhoot munda ne apni kritagyata dikhaane ke liye adwani ke pair chhu liye
 This new warmth of Advani over Munda shows his realization of his ability to run the government with allies fighting amongst themselves
 iske pehle june 2010 main jharkhand vidhansabha ko tab nilambit kar diya gaya tha, jab sansad main ek katautee prastaav par jhamumo pramukh shibu sorain ke upie ke paksh main matdaan karne ke baad bhaajapa ne unki aguai vaali sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 Raghubar Das was the Deputy Chief Minister in that government
 bhaajapa or jhamumo ne sorain kii aguai main 30 disambar, 2009 ko gathbandhan sarkaar banaai thi
 But this government could only run for five months
 teen maheene ke antaraal ke baad sitambar 2010 main donon partiyon ne phir haath mila liye, haalanki is baar netritv munda ko mila
 His displeasure with the changing political developments of Jharkhand — whose birth credit goes to Advani as the Union Home Minister in November 2000 — can be understood
 rajya ke gathan ke 11wein baras main munda vartmaan main rajya kii 8 veen sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 a year ago, Advani was believed to be against the alliance with the JMM once again
 magar tab se halaat main kaaphi badlaav aa chukaa he
 On Friday, when Advani repeatedly praised Chief Minister Munda and his administration in his 8-minute speech in front of a crowd of 40,000 people, his words were confirming that there is now a deepening trust between him and Munda Already happened
 adwani ne kaha, ''main munda ke vichaaron or unke najariye se prabhavit or mujhe bharosa he ki unke netritv main jharkhand bahut nikharegaa
 "it was also like recognizing Munda's efficient leadership
" saal bhar se bhi zyada samay se ve bakhubi gathbandhan sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 Not only this, Munda is also far ahead in terms of good governance
 unki inhen khaasiyaton ne unke liye adwani kii tarif ke daravaaje khole
 But during his Jan Chetna Yatra, Advani's meeting in Ranchi was very different from the one held in the neighboring state of Bihar, where his alliance partner Nitish Kumar flagged off his 38-day Jan Chetna Yatra
 jharkhand kii munda sarkaar teen gathbandhan partiyon se samarthit he-shibu sorain ke netritv vaala jhamumo, sudesh mahato kii aguai vaali ol jharkhand student union (ajasu) or janata dal (united), lekin bihar ke ulat adwani kii jharkhand yatra ek vishuddh partigat maamla thi, jisamen gathbandhan ke teenon saathiyon main se kisi ko bhi adwani kii aam sabhaaon main shaamil hone ke liye nyauta nahin diya gaya tha
 This is being broadly linked to the bjp's concern that it wanted to keep the stage free from the presence of any tainted faces
 gathbandhan ke teenon saathiyon ko isiilie pare rakhaa gaya kyonki bhaajapa bhrashtachar ke kai aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe jhamumo pramukh sorain kii maujuudagi se adwani ke liye kisi tarah kii atpati sthiti paidaa hone dena nahin chaahati thi
 Advani, who was probably on his last political trip against Congress corruption, is believed to have instructed all state units to clean their hands and arrange that no tainted faces come to the stage in their presence
 
 is saal march main jharkhand kii apni pehali yatra main bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari prashasan ke vishyon par charchaa karne ke liye jhamumo pramukh shibu sorain ke nivas par gaye the
 It was practical politics
 magar apane rajnatik kariyar kii sandhyavela main adwani sorain or unki mandali ko dur se bhi nahin choona chahenge
 While their reluctance to be seen with JMM leaders on the stage may not mean much to the stability of the Munda government, it certainly points to the bjp's 'ekla Chalo' plan in the state in the long run
 adwani kii jharkhand yatra se sahyogi dalon ko bhale hi kudhan hui ho, lekin isane jharkhand kii bhaajapa ikai ko nae josh se bhar diya he
 According to BJP state vice-president Deepak Prakash, the party has made up its mind to give direction to the public enthusiasm found in Advani's visit
 unhone kaha, ''yatra ke turant baad pehle charan main party 10,000 gaanvon main apni ikaayiyon kii sthapana karegi taaki sarkaar or party ke liye suchanaaen milane kaa ek swatantra dhaancha taiyaar ho sake
 On the other side of the Pale in the political fray of Jharkhand, the opposition party Congress kept itself in the background and pushed coalition partner Babulal Marandi to attract the attention of all
 congress marandi ko jharkhand kaa niteesha kumaar banaakar pesh karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 It is confident that Marandi, the former BJP leader and the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand, has the political strength to take on the BJP in the state
 jharkhand bhaajapa ke mahasachiv anant ojha kehete hai, ''congress ke paas bhrashtachar virdohi yatra kii aalochana karne laayak vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 For this reason, she remained calm and forwarded Marandi to applaud
 ''adwani kii yatra ne munda kaa aatmavishvaas bhale hi badhaayaa ho, par yah yatra unhen vipaksh ke bajaae apane hi gathbandhan main or zyada virodhiyon se ghira chhod gai he
 His ministers continue to unleash hair on non-administrative subjects, with the fanatics of coalition partners bent on wrangling and coalition partners threatening to topple the government, once Munda was forced to postpone his cabinet meeting
 phir raghubar das jaise party ke saathi ishaara dete nahin thakte ki jharkhand main rajnatik anischitata kaa gurutvkarshan bal sarkaar ke sthayitv par hameshaa baari padataa he lekin munda isse vichlit nahin dikhte
 The path ahead may be difficult, but they are moving forward
 dilli ke dwarka ilaake main ek swift dizaayar car main yuvak kii laash milane se sansani fail gai

 The police reached the spot and opened the car

 But the police feared something untoward in the case

 The police is also interrogating Mahesh's family members
 police jaananaa chaahati he ki kahin kisi se uski koi dushmani to nahin thi yaa uski maut kii koi or vajah he
 At present, the police are also waiting for the post-mortem report, which will clear the entire case

 radhe maa par kuch bhi likhane se pehle ye bataa duun ki main radhe maa kii kahani pichley kai saal se follow kar rahaa hum
 Once it reached Borivali to see who is Radhe Maa? There were two major reasons for this curiosity
 pehali to ye ki wo mumbai shahar ke sabase bade hordings par wo din raat chamakati thi
 It bothered me the question that how are they able to advertise on such a large scale in the city
 pehle kautuhal se kai saal pehle pardaa uth gaya
 It was then learned that Radhe Maa actually lives in the house of the same Gupta ji who does business of hoardings advertising the city
 unka mul dhandha to mithai banane or bechney kaa tha lekin nai peedhee ai to use bill board, sin board main vyapaar nazar aayaa or unhone shahar main badi jagahon par apana kaam shuru kar diya
 It was business mathematics that gave Radhe Ma a place on the city's hoardings
 jo log vigyaapan kaa bazaar jaanate hai wo samajhate hai ki kaise saal main ek daur aata he jab hordings par vigyaapan kam milte hai
 In such an era, Gupta used his media resources and started pasting the photos of Radhe Maa, leaving the hoardings empty
 unki mata kii chaowkee or bhandare ke vigyaapan un khaali dinon main khub dikhte
 Then that era also came when Radhe Maa got a small space under every general advertisement
 shaayad ye wo daur tha jab radhe maa ke bhakt in vigyapanon se khub badhane lage the
 It was said to contact Talli Baba directly to participate in Radhe Ma's programs
 ye talli baba naam hi aisa he ki unako kisi or marcenting kii jarurat hi nahin
 Talli Baba proved to be the best manager of his mother's checkpoints
 gupta ji kii mithai kaa kaarobaar peeche chhot gaya, ab wo radhe maa se pahachaane jane lage
 Many people in the city started telling Radhe Ma's whereabouts i
e
 Gupta's house
 ab vigyaapan kaa dhandha chamakane laga tha or jaise jaise vigyaapan chamake tyon tyon radhe maa badhati chalin gayi
 Just like it happens in every media business, color and looks are taken care of as the seller of the product
 vahi dhyaan radhe maa ke maamle main rakhaa gaya
 Radhe Maa decided less how she would come, how she would look, those people were keeping more who 'manage' them
 jab dikhne kaa sawaal puraa ho gaya to bada sawaal aayaa ki bolnaa bhi prabhaavshaalee hona chaiye
 Radhe Maa was very misfit in the art of speaking in the market of babas and mothers
 to tay hua ki maa to sirf darshan dengi
 The task of speaking was given to the younger mother and Talli Baba
 yani aasthaa ke kaarobaar main choti si outsorcing hui
 Apparently, the weaknesses of the brand were completely covered up till now
 jis daur main har baba- maa, aasthaa se lekar sanskaar par aane ke liye lakhon kharch karne ko taiyaar hon vahaan radhe maa ke manager kabhi apane pravachanon ke liye in channelon ke paas nahin gaye
 Music was also resorted to to meet the lack of speaking
 bollywood waalon se vigyaapan waalon ke rishte achche hue to radhe maa ke darbar main gayakon kii kami nahin rahi
 Maa Darshan Dati, Talli Baba and Chhoti Maa handle dialogues, sing Bollywood songs and devotees swing
 maa sidhe bhakton ke bich nazar aae isliye wo bhi bich bich main naach letin
 The packaging was done well
 brandig or bijnes thik chal rahaa tha ki achaanak se do teen saal pehle ek news channel ko radhe maa main tiarapy nazar ai
 Now what was the advertisement which was used for the promotion of Radhe Ma so far, the same began to fall on them
 us channel ke bade adhikari se phone par maine baat bhi kii thi
 It was then learned that the mother's dance and the outpost audience were enjoying it
 ab radhe maa samuhik manoranjan ke liye istemaal hone lageen
 The latest controversy is related to a case of dowry harassment on Radhe Maa
 wo is cese main saatven number kii aaropee hai

 Gupta has an understanding of business and branding, so the picture of Radhe Maa has been taken from many empty hoardings
 
 Where she was, she has been scratched
 pehle kautuhal se kai saal pehle pardaa uth gaya
 It was then learned that Radhe Maa actually lives in the house of the same Gupta ji who does business of hoardings advertising the city
 unka mul dhandha to mithai banane or bechney kaa tha lekin nai peedhee ai to use bill board, sin board main vyapaar nazar aayaa or unhone shahar main badi jagahon par apana kaam shuru kar diya
 It was business mathematics that gave Radhe Ma a place on the city's hoardings
 jo log vigyaapan kaa bazaar jaanate hai wo samajhate hai ki kaise saal main ek daur aata he jab hordings par vigyaapan kam milte hai
 In such an era, Gupta used his media resources and started pasting the photos of Radhe Maa, leaving the hoardings empty
 unki mata kii chaowkee or bhandare ke vigyaapan un khaali dinon main khub dikhte
 Then that era also came when Radhe Maa got a small space under every general advertisement
 shaayad ye wo daur tha jab radhe maa ke bhakt in vigyapanon se khub badhane lage the
 It was said to contact Talli Baba directly to participate in Radhe Ma's programs
 ye talli baba naam hi aisa he ki unako kisi or marcenting kii jarurat hi nahin
 Talli Baba proved to be the best manager of his mother's checkpoints
 gupta ji kii mithai kaa kaarobaar peeche chhot gaya, ab wo radhe maa se pahachaane jane lage
 Many people in the city started telling Radhe Ma's whereabouts i
e
 Gupta's house
 ab vigyaapan kaa dhandha chamakane laga tha or jaise jaise vigyaapan chamake tyon tyon radhe maa badhati chalin gayi
 Just like it happens in every media business, color and looks are taken care of as the seller of the product
 vahi dhyaan radhe maa ke maamle main rakhaa gaya
 Radhe Maa decided less how she would come, how she would look, those people were keeping more who 'manage' them
 jab dikhne kaa sawaal puraa ho gaya to bada sawaal aayaa ki bolnaa bhi prabhaavshaalee hona chaiye
 Radhe Maa was very misfit in the art of speaking in the market of babas and mothers
 to tay hua ki maa to sirf darshan dengi
 The task of speaking was given to the younger mother and Talli Baba
 yani aasthaa ke kaarobaar main choti si outsorcing hui
 Apparently, the weaknesses of the brand were completely covered up till now
 jis daur main har baba- maa, aasthaa se lekar sanskaar par aane ke liye lakhon kharch karne ko taiyaar hon vahaan radhe maa ke manager kabhi apane pravachanon ke liye in channelon ke paas nahin gaye
 Music was also resorted to to meet the lack of speaking
 bollywood waalon se vigyaapan waalon ke rishte achche hue to radhe maa ke darbar main gayakon kii kami nahin rahi
 Maa Darshan Dati, Talli Baba and Chhoti Maa handle dialogues, sing Bollywood songs and devotees swing
 maa sidhe bhakton ke bich nazar aae isliye wo bhi bich bich main naach letin
 The packaging was done well
 brandig or bijnes thik chal rahaa tha ki achaanak se do teen saal pehle ek news channel ko radhe maa main tiarapy nazar ai
 Now what was the advertisement which was used for the promotion of Radhe Ma so far, the same began to fall on them
 us channel ke bade adhikari se phone par maine baat bhi kii thi
 It was then learned that the mother's dance and the outpost audience were enjoying it
 ab radhe maa samuhik manoranjan ke liye istemaal hone lageen
 The latest controversy is related to a case of dowry harassment on Radhe Maa
 wo is cese main saatven number kii aaropee hai
 But the interest of the media is such that it is the first and the last
 iskaa ye matlab katai nahin he ki radhe maa kanoon kaa saamana na karen
 The comments jo bhi cese radhe maa par hai un sabko khangaal kar dekh len koi gambhir aapraadhik maamla pehali nazar main nahin dikhataa lekin jab brandig ke ganit ulte padate hai to khel kaise haath se nikal duusare ke paas chalaa jaataa he is udhaaharan ab radhe maa hai
 In contrast, now others decide how long the public is interested in Radhe Ma? Till when Whats up and face book Radhe Ma can give some new entertainment
 jab ye sab khatm ho jayega to yakeen maaniye news channelon ko radhe maa ke peediton kii chintaa khatm ho jaaegi
 Gupta has an understanding of business and branding, so the picture of Radhe Maa has been taken from many empty hoardings
 
 Where she was, she has been scratched
 ye vyapaarik ganit hi tha jo radhe maa ko shahar ke hordings par jagah detaa tha
 People who know the advertising market understand how a round comes in the year when advertisements are less on hoardings
 aise daur main gupta ji ne apane media sansadhano kaa istemaal kiya or hordings khaali chhodane kii bazaae radhe maa kii photo chipkaane lage
 His mother's outpost and Bhandare's advertisements would have seen a lot in those empty days
 phir wo daur bhi aayaa jab radhe maa ko har saamaanya vigyaapan ke neeche choti si jagah milane lagi
 Perhaps this was the period when devotees of Radhe Maa started growing a lot through these advertisements
 radhe maa ke kaaryakramon main shaamil hone ke liye sidhe talli baba se sampark karne ko kaha jaataa tha
 The name Talli Baba is such that he does not need any more marketing
 talli baba apni mata kii chaukiyon ke umdaa manager sabit hue
 Gupta's sweet business was left behind, now he started being recognized by Radhe Maa
 shahar main kai log radhe maa kaa thikaana yani gupta ji kaa ghar bataane lage
 Now the business of advertising started shining and as the advertisement shone Radhe Maa continued to grow
 jaise har media ke kaarobaar main hota he ki product bechney vaale ke rup rang or dikhne kaa khyaal rakhaa jaataa he
 The same attention was taken in the case of Radhe Maa
 wo kaise aayegi, kaise dikhegi iskaa faisla radhe maa kam, wo log zyada rakh rahe the jo unhen 'manage' karte hai
 When the question of looks was completed, the big question came that speaking should also be effective
 baabaaon- maanon ke bazaar main radhe maa bolne kii kala main badi missfit thim
 So it was decided that the mother will only see
 bolne kaa kaam choti maa or talli baba ko de diya gaya
 That is, there was little outsourcing in the business of faith
 jaahir si baat he ki ab tak brands kii kamazoriyon ko puraa dhak liya gaya tha
 In the era where every baba-maa is ready to spend millions to come from faith to ritual, Radhe Maa's manager never went to these channels for his sermons
 bolne kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye sangeet kaa sahaara bhi liya gaya
 There was no shortage of singers in Radhe Maa's court if the relationship of Bollywood people with the ad was good
 maa darshan detii, talli baba or choti maa samvaad sambhalate, bollywood gaanaa gaata or bhakt jhuumate
 Mother appeared directly among the devotees, so she would dance in between
 packaging badhiya ho chuki thi
 Branding and business was going well that suddenly two to three years ago, a news channel saw TRP in Radhe Maa
 ab kya tha jo vigyaapan ab tak radhe maa ke prachaar prasar ke liye istemaal hua vahi un par ulataa padane laga
 i also spoke on the phone to the top official of that channel
 tab pataa chalaa tha ki maa kaa dance or chaowkee kaa darshak 'lutf' uthaa rahe hai
 Now Radhe Maa started being used for mass entertainment
 tazaa vivaad radhe maa par kisi dahej pratadna ke cese se judaa he
 She is the seventh accused in the case
 lekin media kii dilchaspee kuch aisi he ki maano vahi pehali or aakhri vahiin hai
 This does not mean that Radhe Maa should not face the law
 tippaniyan Look at all the cases which are on Radhe Ma
 Look at all the serious criminal cases at first glance, but when the mathematics of branding turns upside down, then the example of how the game goes out of hand is now Radhe Maa
 is ulte ganit main ab duusare log tay karte hai ki radhe maa main janata kii dilchaspee kab tak he? kab tak whats ap or phase book par radhe maa kuch nayaa manoranjan de sakati hai
 When all this ends, then believe me the news channels will be worried over the victims of Radhe Maa
 gupta ji ko bijnes or brandig kii samaj he isaliye kai khaali pade hordings par se radhe maa kii tasviir utaar lee gai he
 
 jahaan thi use kharonch diya gaya he
 Then that era also came when Radhe Maa got a small space under every general advertisement

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that the government, at a recent meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO), opted to take a tough stance to protect the interests of the poor people of the country instead of getting publicity in the international media

 The Modi government will present the interim budget on February 1, about 2 months before the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 is bajet main sarkaar kaa puraa focus aam aadmi par hoga
 Anyway, in the last 5 years the Modi government has come up with many good schemes, which has improved the condition of the common man
 sarkaar un yojanaon ko loksabhaa chunaav main bhunaane kii koshish karegi
 But the Modi government is still on the backfoot regarding demonetisation
 kyonki sarkaar ko ummid thi ki notebandi se bade paimaane par kaledhan kaa khulaasa hoga
 But after demonetisation, more than 99 percent of the old notes were returned to the bank
 uske baad vipaksh kaa sarkaar par hamalaa or tej ho gaya he
 The opposition alleges that the Modi government had announced demonetisation without thinking, it did not reveal black money, but the common man's financial situation worsened
 vipaksh kaa tark he ki notebandi kii vajah har varg ke log pareshaan ho gaye
 Around 100 people died due to the change of note
 darasal, vipaksh 8 november 2016, se hi notebandi ko lekar sarkaar ko gherne main laga he
 However, the government claims that black money, Naxalism and terrorism have been the main reason for demonetisation
 lekin vipaksh notebandi kaa mudda 2019 main bhi oochaal saktaa he
 Now the government wants that if a class has suffered due to demonetisation, then they should be made happy through the interim budget
 iske alaava jiesti ko lekar bhi vipaksh hamalavar he, khaskar congress kaa kahana he ki jiesti kii vajah se chote kaarobaariyon kaa dhandha chaupat ho gaya he
 Closure of business has made it difficult for people to run home
 haalanki GST masale ko gambhirtha lete hue sarkaar ne pichley kuch maheenon main GST kii daron main kai baar badlaav kiye hai
 But the opposition is still cashing in on the GST
 aise main modi sarkaar antarim bajet ke jariye un virgon ko khush kar saktaa he, jo notebandi or phir jiesti kii vajah se thode naaraaz hai
 The government is considering raising the income tax exemption limit to please the middle class
 saath hi sarkaar kisaanon ko kam byaaj dar par lone or beemaa kii suvidha dene kaa elaan kar sakati he
 Apart from this, the government can come up with a proposal to cut home loan interest rate
 vahiin jiesti kii vajah chote kaarobaariyon main thodi naaraazgi he
 The government may ignore the big businessmen in the budget, but they can get more concessions in the GST to allay the displeasure of small businessmen
 ab bas sabhi ko ek farvari kaa intjaar he jab modi sarkaar kaa sansad main pitara khulegaa

 During this time the dispute started and went on increasing
 jahaan par bike ko lekar vivaad hua, phir dabangon ne logon se marpet kii or kareeb aadhe ghante tak bavaal kaata
 After getting information about the ruckus, the police reached the spot and lodged a case in the local people and asked them to take strict action against the culprits

 The domineering youth entered the Dalit colony and beat up the women fiercely
 itnaa hi nahin dabangon ne dalit pariwaron kii lakdi ke saamaan se bhari dukaan ko aag ke hawaale kar diya or duusare khokhe ko naale main phenk diya gaya
 According to local people, the Dabangas beat up many people
 haalanki, marpet karne vaale log koun the is baat kaa pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 But since the accident, the area has a tumultuous atmosphere and the administration expects justice

 pashchimi dilli ke janakapuri ilaake main badmaashon ne ek vyapaaree ke ghar main ghuskar ek karod kii phiroti maangi
 This is the same crook who committed the loot of about 15 lakhs at the gunpoint from the same merchant's shop a month ago and escaped by saying that the extortion of one crore rupees was borrowed
 aise main abhi pehla maamla thanda bhi nahin hua tha ki phir se ye badmaash peedit ke ghar main ghuskar dobaaraa phiroti kii maang kar kanoon ko thenga dikhaa diya
 After this incident, the businessman's family is scared and pleads for justice

 At the same time, if the victim is to be believed, late Wednesday night, the bourgeois businessman was in the hospital for two days due to illness
 ghar ke duusare sadsy bhi ghar se baahar gaye hue the
 Meanwhile, late night, the crook Surya reached the victim's house where only the elderly woman and the guard of the house were present in the house
 badmaash surya ne peedit ke ghar pahunchakar guard kii pitayee kii or bujurg mahila ko dhamkaaya
 In lieu of the well being of the family, he demanded extortion of one crore rupees as a ransom
 vahiin, ghar main kisi ko na dekh surya sidhe us aspataal main pahunch gaya jis aspataal main peedit ilaaj karwaane gaye the
 Meanwhile, a call was made from the house to the trafficked businessman in the hospital where he was informed about the incident in the house
 aise main aaropee se bachane ke liye peedit vyapaaree or unka betaa aspataal main hi chup gaye or police ko maamle kii jaankaree di
 The police then reached the hospital and brought the victim to a safe home
 peedit parivaar kaa kahana he ki rajdhani dilli main jab apradhi aise bekhauf hokar aparaadh ko anjaam de rahe hai, to phir aakhir bhala desh ke duusare rajyon kaa kya haal hoga
 In such a situation, where the victim's family is now pleading for justice, the victim's family is forced to live in the shadow of fear and fear
 vahiin, aspataal main lage sisitivi camaron kii footage se bhi aropiyon kii pahchaan kii ja rahi he jisase police aropiyon tak pahunch sake

 court ne apane 10 may ke faisle par punarvichaar se inkaar karte hue ye yachika khaarij keeis faisle kaa asar saadhe teen lakh se bhi zyada shikshakon ke bhavishya par padegasupreme court ke faisle ke khilaaf ye punarvichaar yachika daayar kii gai thibihar ke teen lakh se zyada niojit shikshakon ko supreme court se koi raahat nahin mil saki he
 The Supreme Court has rejected the review petition of employed teachers
 court ne apane 10 may ke faisle par punarvichaar se inkaar karte hue ye yachika khaarij kii he
 It is being said that this decision will affect the future of more than three and a half lakh teachers
 supreme court ne spasht kiya he ki faisle main koi galati nahin he isliye is par koi punarvichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Let me tell you that on May 10 this year, the Supreme Court refused to order employed teachers to be given the same salary as regular teachers
 is faisle main supreme court ne bihar sarkaar kii wo yachika manjuur kar lee thi jisamen sarkaar ne apana puraa paksh rakhaa tha
 Apart from this, the court had also canceled the order of Patna High Court
 iske baad hi shikshakon kii ore se rivyuu pitishan daayar kii gai thi
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday, while giving its verdict on the review petition, said that there is no need to change the old judgment
 patna hai court ne kaha thise maamle main 31 oktober 2017 ko patna hai court ne sunwaayee karte hue niojit shikshakon ke paksh main aadesh diya tha
 The court said that the teachers employed should also be paid equal to the regular teachers
 phir rajya sarkaar kii ore se is faisle ke khilaaf supreme court main vishesh anumati yachika lagaai gai
 This was the plea of the Bihar government
 In the whole matter, it was the plea of the Bihar government that due to this order, the government of Bihar would incur an additional burden of Rs 9500 crore
 centre sarkaar ne bhi is maamle main bihar sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 In the 36-page affidavit, the Central Government had said in the court that these employed teachers cannot be given equal pay for the same work
 sarkaar kaa tark tha ki samaan kaary ke liye samaan vetan ke category main ye niojit shikshak nahin aate
 If they are brought in this category, then the government will incur an additional burden of about 36998 crore per year
 phir ye bhi kaha ja rahaa tha ki agar inaki maang maani gai to duusare rajyon se bhi aise maamle aaenge
 Teachers were doing similar work - seeking equal pay in Bihar, about 3
 7 lakh niojit shikshak karyrat hai
 70 percent of the salary of teachers is given by the Central Government and 30 percent by the State Government
 vartmaan main niojit shikshakon (trend) ko 20 se 25 hajaar rupye tak vetan miltaa he
 Teachers were demanding equal pay in exchange for equal work
 agar ye maang puri hoti to shikshakon kaa vetan 35 se 44 hajaar rupye ho saktaa tha

 The government is set to bring the new National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill 2019 into Parliament
 lekin ek aisa pech he, jise lekar tikhi bahes or doctoron kii ore se virodh ke puure asaar hai
 Aaj Tak / India Today has come to know that the disputed bridge course has been quietly converted into a 'limited license for the practice of modern medicine'
 bataa den ki brij course ko lekar desh bhar main doctoron ne sakht virodh jataayaa tha
 Section 32 of the NMC Act 2019 mentions the role of community health provider
 isamen kaha gaya he, ayog madhya str par samudaay swasthya pradaata ke taur par medicine practice karne ke liye aise vyakti ko simit license jari kar saktaa he jo aadhunik vaigyanik medical peshey se judaa he or jo niyaman ke tahat muhaiyaa karaae gaye maapdand ko puraa karata he
 Also, the limited licenses granted under this sub-section should not exceed one-third of the total number of licensed medical practitioners registered under sub-section (1) of section 31
 act kii dhara 31 sabhi manyata praapt medical practicenurs kaa rashtriya register banane se sambandhit he, jiskaa rakrakhaav athiks and medical registration board kii ore se kiya jayega
 Earlier, in the NMC Bill 2018, the proposed bridge course was opposed by the doctors and health practitioners
 is brij course ke jariye homeopathy or ayurveda vaale allopathy kii practice karne kii anumati mil sakati thi
 The doctor was referred to the parliamentary panel after several rounds of protests and several meetings with the then Health Minister JP Nadda
 panel ne is praavdhaan ko anivaary naa banane kii sifarish kii
 The panel also recommended strict punishment for those who practice medicine without the necessary qualifications
 doctors ne nae bill main ‘aadhunik medicine kii practice ke liye simit license’ ke sandarbh par sawaal uthaaya he
 Indian Medical Association (IMA) general secretary RV Ashokan said, "new section 32 has been added in which community health providers such as compounders, pathologists, lab technicians, radiologists, blood samples etc
 can get the license for practicing medicine Are without the supervision of a qualified doctor
 agar sarkaar apane welnes centres par logon ko rakhana chaahati he or maanav sansaadhan kaa abhaav he to uske liye pehle se hi drugs and cosmetics act main praavdhaan hai
 For this, there is no need for provision of separate license to nearly three and a half lakh people who do not come from solid medical background
 ye raashtra ke swasthya ke liye tabaahi se kam nahin hoga
 "he removed the bridge course but added section 32," says Ravindra Wankhedkar, former IMA president
 yahaan tak ki aadhunik medicine se koi dur se bhi judaa he, jaise ki lab technician, wo bhi ab sidhe aadhunik medicine practice kar saktaa he
 This is like raising legal registered quacks in India
 agar sarkaar kaa vichaar marijon kii sankhya or aspataal-clinics main doctors kii sankhya ke antar ko paatane kii he, jo gramin kshetron main staff kii kami kii vajah se he to main kahana chaahunga ki kya gramin bharat main achche doctors nahin hone chahie? kya gramin bharat main rahane vaale log doum darje ke hai? kya unki jaan ko jokhim main daalaa janaa chahie aise doctoron ke jariye jo sahi se marz ko bhi nahin pahchaan saken
 According to the data, there are 11 lakh registered allopaths in India
 iskaa matlab he ki kareeb 3
 5 lakh AYUSH practitioners will be issued licenses to provide health protection to patients at primary level
 jahaan tak doctor samudaay kaa sawaal he to ve bill kaa virodh jari rakhenge or deshvyapee pradarshan kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Under this, the NMC bill will be lit outside IMA offices in many parts of the country on Thursday
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki jab tak vivaadit dhara ko bill se nahin hataaya jayega, ve virodh jari rakhenge

 " dilli sarkaar ke skulon main pehali hi parents-teacher meeting ke baad ek bacchee kii aatmahatya kaa sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 The incident occurred around 11 am
 30 baje kii he
 a 12-year-old girl living in Khyala was a sixth-grade student at a local government school
 philhal mili jaankaree ke mutabik bacchee ne parents teacher meeting ke baad report ke dabaav main faansee lagaakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Be it television, newspaper, radio or internet, questioning the plan of the Delhi government, through almost every possible publicity, the Delhi government strongly publicized the first PTM i
e
 Parent Teacher Meeting in the government schools of Delhi
 sarkaar kaa makasad tha ki pitim ke jariye jo badlaav wo skulon kii karypranali main laana chaahati he uskaa puraa milage liya ja sake
 But this suicide after the first PTM has raised many questions, the first of which is that teachers of Delhi government schools need to first train how to tell children about their shortcomings
 report acchhee naa aane par dabaav main aa gai baccheebaharhaal, bacchee ke gharavaalon se mili jaankaree ke mutabik pitim main bacchee kii maa or uski bahan gai thi
 On the basis of what the teacher had told the mother after coming back from PTM, the girl's sister told her that the report in the school was not good
 is baat se hi bacchee itane dabaav main aa gai ki usne aatmahatya jaisaa ghaatak kadam uthaa liya
 Reacting to the first PTM soon after the political incident that began after suicide, Delhi bjp's media in-charge Pravin Shankar Kapoor said that the Delhi government is trying to make general counseling like PTM a mega event
 sarkaar or usamen shikshakon ne parents ke saamne sirf shikaayatein hi rakhin aisa hi kuch bacchee ke saath hua or lagata he usne dabaav main ye kadam uthaa liya
 'delhi government is under pressure
 upmukhyamantri or shiksha mantrimanish sisodiyane kaha he ki 'sarkaar ghatana ke tathy jaanane kii koshish kar rahi he
 It is important to know whether the girl went to PTM or not
 'faansee ke fande par jhulate kai sawaljaisa ki dilli main har ghatana ke saath hota he, pitim ke baad hui isatmahatyapar raajnneeti bhi hone lagi he, lekin is raajnneeti se zyada ahm wo sawaal hai, jo bacchee faansee ke fande par jhulata chhod gai he
 The biggest of all questions is that teachers of government schools should not be explained first that the main purpose of PTM is to tell the parents about the strengths of the children and then explain how to overcome the shortcomings

 There is a hidden meaning in these words of Rahul Gandhi
 paanch din pehle party chhodkar gayi upie-2 kii paryaavaran mantri jayanti natarajan ke jawaab ke taur par dilli main 4 farvari ko ek chunavi raily main rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan party ke varisht netaaon ko ek kadaa sanket he ki congress unheen ke hisaab se chalegi
 Rahul Gandhi's statement has come at a time when Natarajan left the party expressing disappointment over the ill-treatment done by Rahul and Congress President Sonia Gandhi and this incident has infused some veterans of the party for a long time
 They have given vent to the dissatisfaction, due to which they have continuously kept in mind the embarrassing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections last year and the damage done to the party in the subsequent assembly elections
 Sector have been talking
 beete 14 maheenon main natarajan or krishna tirath samet kareeb darjan bhar bade netaaon ne party chhod di he
 Apart from this, many more are reportedly in the process of leaving the party
 iske baavjood party main palada un logon ke khilaaf hi jhukaa hua he
 Sonia has now stopped mediating between Rahul and disgruntled top leaders, and even after a complaint letter written by Natarajan in November became public on January 30, a close aide defended the fact that such incidents would leave Rahul Taking the command of the party cannot deter you
 unhone yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki kaise 1998 main jab ve congress kii adhyaksh bani thim, unke upar bhi apni samarthy ko lekar aise hi sawaal uthe the
 Despite Sonia Gandhi's landing in defense of her son, the scale of loyalty to the nehru-gandhi dynasty is no longer as strong as it once was in Congress politics
 punjab ke purv mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne bhale hi sonia ke anurodh par arun jetali ke khilaaf loksabhaa kaa chunaav pichhali baar ladaa ho, lekin aaj ve is baat ke saaf sanket dene se nahin chook rahe hai ki agar rajya congress ke prabharee pratap singh bajva ko nahin hataaya gaya to ve party ko chhod denge
 However, nothing is happening as Rahul is not in favor of removing Bajwa whom he himself chose in 2013
 party ke ek anya diggaj netaa pi chidambaram ko to rahul ke karyaalay sah awaas 12, tughlaq road par bhaage-bhaage aana padaa jab tamilnadu congress ke mukhiya iwikees elangovan ne unhen or unke bete karti ko party chhodane kii dhamkee de daali
 Ilangovan was also chosen by Rahul when G
 ke

 ke
 Moopanar's party formed in 1996 had left the party to revive the Tamil Manila Congress
 elangovan ko sonia gandhi ne kathith taur par chetaya tha
 However, party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi claims that Ilangovan never took Chidambaram's name
 isi tarah rahul ke nirdesh kaa paalan karte hue party mahasachiv janardan dvivedi par sanchaar prakoshth ke adhyaksh ajay maakan ne pratibandh laga diya tha, jinhen baad main party kii anushaasan samiti ke prabharee e ke antni ne talab kar daalaa, jabaki dvivedi ne kuch ghanton ke bheetar hi pradhanmantri narendra modi kii prashansa main die apane us kathith bayaan kaa khandan kar diya tha jisaki khabar ek website par chhapi thi
 Sonia Gandhi remained silent even during this incident
 haryana main purv mukhyamantri or sonia ke vafaadaar bhupinder singh hooda bhi niraash hai ki rajya main party nae netritv ko badhaava de rahi he
 Last year, 38-year-old Ashok Tanwar, a close aide of Rahul, was made the president of the state Congress
 november main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke baad jab party simat kar kul 15 siton par aa gai, to hooda virdohi kheme kii maani jane vaali kiran choudhary ko netaa pratipaksh bana diya gaya

 Hemant Biswa Sarma, the main architect of the Congress's landslide victory in Assam in 2011, resigned from the ministerial berth in July last after he failed to replace Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi
 tab se hi bhartiya janata party un par dore daal rahi he
 Since then, Rahul has met him thrice, but he has not been able to provide relief to Sarma, who was the Minister of Education and Health
 kerala, bihar or pashchim bengal main puraane netaaon ne apane-apane rajya main rahul ke niyukt kiye logon ke liye dikkatein khadi kar ke tathaa congress kaarysmiti or rajya congress adhyaksh kaa chunaav karwaane kii rahul kii mahatvakankshi yojana main baadha daalkar kuch had tak palatwaar kiya he
 Anil Shastri, a special invitee to the Congress Working Committee, says, "some Congress leaders have consistently tried to weaken and discredit Rahul Gandhi
" ''sthitiyaan chaahe jo hon, baaji ab lag chuki he
 If a former Union minister is to be believed, according to him, Rahul absolutely wants to raise the party from the floor and he intends that "traditionalist" politicians leave the party
 yuvak congress main chunaav kii parampara shuru karne vaale congress upaadhyaksh rahul ke bare main ek purv kendriya mantri kehete hai, ''unhen koi fark nahin padataa
 He had made his intention clear only in his address to the leaders of the Youth Congress in December 2014
 unke hisaab se 2007 se pehle or uske baad kii congress main saaf taur par ek fark he
 They don't want people from pre-2007 era
 ''aise buniyadi badlaav kii yojanaon ko rajasthan jaise rajyon main haal hi mili kamyaabiyon se bal mila he jahaan 70 se zyada netaaon ne sachin payalat ke netritv vaali rajya congress ikai kaa daaman march 2014 ke baad se thama he, jinamein chaar purv mantri or saat purv vidhayak bhi hai
 As part of this rejuvenation plan, Rahul has sent Kanishka Singh, considered his right hand, to Lodi Estate, 35, to work with his sister Priyanka
 america main hwarton se emb kii oopaadhi praapt kanishka singh samet sonia ke nijee sachiv rahe or baad main rashtriya salaahkaar parishad main oesady rahe rajasthan lok seva ke adhikari dhiraj shrivastav ko priyanka kii team main bhejne se in atakalon ko bhi hawa mili he ki priyanka aage party main badi bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 The departure of Natarajan will hardly affect the party's electoral fortunes in Tamil Nadu
 vahaan vaise bhi party kaa koi bahut vyapak aadhaar nahin he, lekin ajit jogi, hemanth biswa sarama or amarinder singh jaise bade khiladiyon ke jane se inke apane rajyon main party ke sanghathanaatmak dhaanche ko gambhir chot pahunch sakati he, khaskar amarinder ko lekar chintaaen kuch zyada hai jinhone punjab congress ke bheetar apane prabhaav kaa pradarshan karte hue party ke 43 main 30 vidhayakon samet purv kendriya mantri manish tiwari ko bhi beeti 24 janvari ko amritsar kii apni ''lalkaar raily'' main khinch liya tha
 Rahul may want to implement his plan of restoration from the states, but those who mislead him are trying to maintain the status quo

 The fifth one-day international cricket match between India and Australia was officially canceled without a single ball being bowled after inspection by the umpires on Saturday morning
 odisha cricket sangh (osie) ne shuukravaar ko hi match ke aayojan kii ummid chhod di thi or tikat ke paise waapas karne kii tarikhon kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Due to low pressure area in andhra-telangana region, it has been raining continuously for the last five days
 ampire nigel long, es ravi or si shamsuddin ne subah 11 baje maidan kaa nirikshan kiya, kyonki paanch din kii lagaataar barish ke baad kuch dhoop nikali thi
 The ground however was quite wet in many places and mud-like situation in many places, after which the umpires decided to cancel the match officially
 osie sachiv aashirwad behda ne kaha, nirikshan ke baad ampiron ne apni report main likhaa ki oufield khilne ke liye feet nahin he or khel sambhav nahin he
 Both teams were stationed in the capital Bhavuneshwar and did not take the field today

 Police have arrested an accused who made former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha a victim of online fraud, while the mastermind of the fraud is being searched
 police ne giraftaar aaropee kii pahchaan dinesh mali ke rup main kii he
 Dinesh has been a vicious cyber criminal
 dinesh ne purv chif justise of india aaram lodha se ek lakh rupee kii thaki thi
 Justice Lodha, in his complaint to the Delhi Police, said that late at 19:30 on April 19, a mail from retired Justice BP Singh came to his mail
 mail kar unhone bhattije kii beemaari ke liye turant paise kii madad maangi mail karne vaale ne ye bhi kaha ki wo phone par baat nahin kar sakate or dinesh mali naam ke shaks ke acount main paise daalane ke liye kaha gaya
 Dinesh Mali was described by the accused as the treating doctor
 justise lodha ne 19 april ko hi 2 baar main us acount main online pement ke jariye 1 lakh rupee bhej die lekin jab 30 may ko ritred justise beepi singh se sampark hua to pataa chalaa ki unhone paise to mangaaye hi nahin, unka mail acount kisi ne hack kar mail kiya tha
 As soon as the police received this complaint, the police registered a case and started the investigation
 dilli police kii sibar cell ne maamle kii jaanch kiya to pataa chalaa ki jis acount main paise daale gaye the wo acount udaipur ke rahane vaale dinesh mali naam ke shaks kaa he
 Police said that Dinesh told Dinesh Mali that his account was opened by a person named Mukesh
 mukesh dinesh mali kaa dost he pehle donon ek hi company main kaam karte the
 Mukesh used to give a thousand rupees to Dinesh Mali when he was transferred to one lakh account
 jiske baad police ne dinesh mali ko giraftaar kar liya
 According to the police, till now millions of rupees have been transferred to Dinesh's account
 yani ye kaaphi samay se thagi kaa kaarobaar kar rahe the
 Mukesh used to open Dinesh's account and used to give him one thousand rupees but one thousand rupees
 philhal police mukesh kii talash kar rahi he
 Now the police is trying to find out whose mail account the mail came from
 or kya mukesh hi thagi ke is gang kaa mastermind he yaa isame or log bhi shaamil hai
 West Bengal is in the limelight
 rajya kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne piem modi ke prati behad aakraamak ravaiya akhriyaar kiya hua he
 At the same time, PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are also standing in West Bengal, doing rallies continuously
 42 siton vaale is rajya main ab tak paanchon charnon main hinsa hui he
 In this fight, the elections for five phases and 25 seats have gone out
 bachi hai 17 siten, lihaaja kisi ko chaiyn nahin he
 Electoral strife in the state has finally reached the hindu-muslims
 bijepi ko yahaan baithe-bithaae jayshriram kaa nayaa or ‘kargar’ mudda mil gaya he
 Not UP, but now expectations from West bengalwest Bengal is in fact a political toy made out of the horror of bjp's amazing success in Uttar Pradesh in 2014
 samaajawaadee party or bispi ke talmail ke baad bhartiya janata party galati se bhi uttar pradesh ke bharose nahin rahanaa chaahati
 The BJP has become dependent on Bengal to a large extent to make up for up's potential losses
 mamata ise bachaane ke liye akhaade main taal thokkar utar gai hai
 The problem for the BJP in this is that Bengal's witchcraft is Mamta, not Modi
 netaaon kii talkhi kaa asar kaaryakartaaon parbengal main na to 2014 main modi kaa jaadu chalaa, na hi 2016 main
 Both a Prime Minister and a Chief Minister have destroyed mutual respect in the Bay of Bengal
 na modi mamata ko dekhnaa chaahate hai or na mamata modi ko
 In this war of the two, the workers have become enemies of each other

 From Narendra Modi to Amit Shah, with the slogan of Jai Shri Ram, he has put his life into making the election Hindu versus Muslim
 mangalvaar ko medinipur main amit shah ne khuleam chunauti de di ki mamata didi ab aapse jo ban padataa he ukhaad lo, jo dhara lagaani he laga do
 In such a situation, in Bengal, it is useless to ask who is falling into the deepest part of the language and who is blowing so many pieces of morality
 The curious case of Triple t and how it is ruining West Bengal
 pic
 twitter
 com / urqubcl5vs — Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 6, 2019 is leaving no stone unturned
actually Modi feels that if Bengal does not come this time, it will not come forward and Mamta feels that Bengal gets out of hand this time
 If left, it will leave isiilie kisi ne koi kasar nahin chodi he kisi ko nicha dikhaane main, bengal ko hindu-musalmaan banane main
 295 seats in the assembly, who has how much BJP is intent on making Kisabangla a Hindu Muslim? or kyon trinmul is vimarsh par apni gotiyaan khel rahi hai
 Think of it this way - the total assembly seats in West Bengal are 295
 isamen trinmul congress ke paas 213, congress 42, sipiem 26 or bijepi ke paas 3 siten hai
 Now from here the BJP is dreaming that it will overthrow Mamata Banerjee and the only land in this dream can be that the game should be converted to Hindu vs Muslim
 kyon? ise jaraa aise samajhie
 How much representation of Muslim leaders in Bengal has 59 Muslim mlas
 7 muslim mantri or 8 muslim saansad
 The Muslim population is 27% here
 aise main bijepi ko lagata he ki kisi bhi tarah se agar maamla hindu banaam musalmaan ban jaae to bengal main baat ban jaae
 But Mamta is the magician of Bengal politics
 ise samajhane ke liye in aankadon par gaur karnaa hoga
 Mamta's magic in the assembly elections Mamata contested the 2011 assembly elections with the Congress
 isamen tiemasi ko 184 or congress ko 42 siten milin
 After this, Mamta contested the 2016 assembly elections on her own
 isamen tiemasi 211, congress 42 or bijepi ko 3 siten milin
 Baffled by Modi wave, Bengal now takes a look at the condition of Modi wave in Bengal
 2014 main desh main modi lahar chal rahi thi
 Everybody was looking for a way to escape
 modi kii us lahar main bhi mamata ne akele dam par modi ke khilaaf kham thoka
 In the Modi wave too, Mamata brought 34 seats
 vahiin congress ko 4 or bijepi ko mahaj 2 siten milin
 These are the figures that have made PM Modi and Amit Shah sleepless
 wo aankade hai jinhen bachaane ke liye mamata ne aakraamak ho gai he
 April 13 is the Mahashtami of Chaitra Navratri on Saturday
 mahashtami ke din kanya pujan kiya jaataa he
 Although some people worship Kanya on Navami too
 manyata he ki kanya pujan karne se vaasantik navaratri kaa shubh fal miltaa he
 Mahagauri Durga is worshiped on the eighth day of Navratri
 mahrishtami ke din kanyaon kaa pujan karne se maa durga prasann hoti hai or apane bhakton par krupa barsaati hai
 Why and how Kanya Puja is performed? Kanya Puja is of great importance during Navratri
 is din nau kanyaon ko nau deviyon ke pratibimb ke rup main poojane ke baad hi bhakton ke navaratri vrath puure maane jate hai
 It is believed that on this day, during Durga Puja, mother Durga gets pleased only by offering Dakshina to her mother and queen as per her ability
 aise karen kanya pujan--kanyaon ke pair dhokar aasaan par bithaaen
 - Start lamp worship after lighting lamp and incense
 - kanyaon par pavitra jal chhidakar unhen sindur or durva kaa tilak lagaaein
 - Tie the Kalava to the left wrist, wear red garlands to the girls and garland them with flowers
 - nariyal phodkar uske chote chote tukade karen
 - Offer pudding, gram, fruits and coconut to the girls
 - iske baad kanyaon ko dakshina den
 - Salute the girls and seek their blessings
 navaratri ke aathven din maha gauri kii puja karen
 - Worshiping Mother Mahagauri in the eighth form of Goddess Durga on Ashtami day gives relief from all distress
 - kanyaon kii shaadi kaa yoga banataa he
 - Relations between husband and wife end
 - maa ko gud kii kheer kaa bhoga lagaaein
 - Offer a red cloth to the mother by lighting eight lamps
 desh main ekikrut maal evam sevaaon kaa hastantaran sunishchit karne or vividh karon ke boj ko kam karne vaala vastu evam seva kar (jiesti) se sambandhit vidheyak aaj loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while presenting the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill 2014, said that the draft constitution amendment bill related to goods and services tax has taken into account the concerns of the states
 unhone kaha ki pichley saptaah kai rajyon ke mantriyon evam pratinidhiyon ke saath unki baithak hui thi, jisamen jiesti se sambandhit samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke masaude ko dikhaaya gaya
 He said that some improvements have also been made in this draft on the opinion of the states
 unhone kaha ki aisi hi baithak pichley somvaar ko bhi hui thi
 He said that GST will be a state of profit for both the center and the state
 jiesti lagu hone se rajyon ko kar kii jo haani hogi uski bharpai ke liye sanvaidhanik guarantee kaa praavdhaan hoga
 This would have many benefits on a practical level

 He said that it is good that West Bengal has supported it a lot
 vittamantri ne kaha ki isse ekal maal evam sevaaon kaa hastantaran sunishchit hone ke saath kai karon ke boj ko kam kiya ja sakegaa
 He said that the initiative for payment of dues to the states under the Central Sales Tax (CST) has been taken so that GST can be carried forward
 hamane aisi vyavastha kii he taaki kisi rajya ko ek paise kaa nuksaan nahin ho
 Significantly, the Union Cabinet has ratified its Constitution Amendment Bill related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is leading the reforms in the indirect tax sector
 sarkaar ne kaha ki is vidheyak ko pesh kar diya gaya he lekin charchaa or paaran ke liye ise sansad ke agle satr main liya jayega
 The objectives and reasons of the Bill stated that the Goods and Services Tax will replace many indirect taxes being acquired by the Central and State Governments and it is intended to create a national market for goods and services
 iske tahat maal evam seva kar ko sanchalit karne vaali vidhiyaan banane ke liye sansad or rajya vidhaan mandalon ko samavarti shaktiyaan pradaan kii gai he
 Regarding petroleum and petroleum products, it has been provided that these Goods and Services Tax will not be subject to the provisions of Goods and Services Key till the date notified on the recommendation of the Council

 The proposed GST on tax on petroleum products was stuck for almost seven years

 Earlier, the GST Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, but it was repealed with the end of the term of the Lok Sabha

 The Home Department of Delhi Government issued orders on 17 January 2017 for restructuring the Special Task Force with the approval from LG
 special task force main alji anil baijal ke alaava 16 sadsy honge
 The meeting of this task force will be held every 15 days
 twitor par mishael ne kaha, acha to ham chalate hai
 
 
 In addition to LG, the Task Force formed for the protection of women in Delhi will have 16 members
 jisamen dilli ke chif secretary, dilli police kamishnar, dilli mahila ayog kii cheirperson, home department (dilli) ke principal secretary, diviginal kamishnar (revenue), transport kamishnar (dilli), dilli police ke specianal kamishnar (trephic), special kamishnar dilli police (woomen sefti), endiemasi ke cheirperson, teenon dilli nagar nimag ke kamishnar (east, west, south), exise kamishnar (dilli), mahila evam bal vikaas vibhaag (dilli) kii secretary, soshal welfare department kii secretary or ek sadsy kendriya grih mantralay kii union terretary divijan se hoga
 Apart from this, if another member is required in this task force, then it can be included

 The decision to form a Special Task Force has been taken after the intervention of the Hon'ble High Court
 pichley dedh saal se dilli mahila ayog lagaataar yah maang kar rahaa tha ki dilli main mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye ek special task force kaa gathan kiya jaae jisamen centre sarkaar or dilli sarkaar, dilli police or mahila ayog ko bhi shaamil kiya jaae, taaki mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar centre or dilli sarkaar ek manch par aakar thos nirnay le saken or mahilaon kii suraksha se judi jamini hakeekat ke bare main mahila ayog estf ko avgat karaata rahe
 Because Delhi Police comes under the Central Government because of the special status of Delhi and Delhi Police is the most important link for the security of women of Delhi
 lekin koi aisa plateform nahin tha jahaan par centre sarkaar, dilli sarkaar, dilli police or dilli mahila ayog ek saath milakar dilli kii mahilaon kii suraksha ke mudde ko lekar meeting karen or nirnay len
 Women have become 'companions' in 60 thousand villages
 The Internet is aware that after the Nirbhaya rape scandal in 2012, the issue of the safety of women was raised in Parliament in Delhi, when the then Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde headed Delhi
 a special task force (STF) was formed to protect women
 is meeting main jab dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh ne dilli kii mahilaon se jude suraksha ke muddon ko uthaanaa shuru kiya to is estf ko yah kahkar band vah uddeshy puraa ho chukaa he
 In view of these conditions, the Delhi Women's Commission had no other way than to go to the court and the Commission took refuge in the court
 21 disambar 2016 ko dilli hoicourt main justise bidi ahamed kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne alji ko notice dekar poocha tha ki dilli main mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye koi estf kyon nahin bani
 In response to the notice, LG Anil Baijal has filed affidavit in the court that on January 17, it was decided to restructure the STF

 'input IANS se The Congress has demanded a judicial inquiry into the deadline in the Jai Shah property
 is maamle main congress ke communication department ke head randeep surajevaala ne piem narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ham is maamle main ek swatantra or vishwasaneey jaanch kii maang karte hai
 a commission of two senior judges of the Supreme Court should investigate the deadline in this case
 congress ne apane pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ke jariye bijepi, uske adhyaksh amit shah or piem narendra modi se 9 sawaal kiye
 In those questions, the Congress has raised many serious issues in the Jai Shah case
 jai shah maamle main bijepi se congress ke 9 sawaal:1
 How did the business of Temple Enterprises Private Limited (a company of Amit Shah's wife, daughter-in-law and son) grow by 16 thousand times in a year? Congress spokesperson Surjewala asked which magic wand that the company of which 18 in the last 10 years
 8 lakh rupee kaa sarplus he, uski kamai bijepi sarkaar banate hi ek saal main 16 hajaar guna bad jaati he?2
 Jai Shah's company where 1 in 2013-14
 3 karod rupee kaa karj leti he, vahiin aisi koun si paristhiti thi ki bijepi sarkaar banate hi company ko 400 guna zyada 53
 4 crore rupees had to take loan? 3
 aisi koun si paristhiti upji jiske kaaran temple interprijej privet limited ko oktober 2016 main achaanak band karnaa padaa
 While the company increased its turnover by 16 thousand times? Was it not the duty of the tax department to give notice in this case and to investigate the reasons for the closure of the company under suspicious circumstances? 4
 jai shah kii company temple interprijej ko videshi bainkon ke acount se 51 karod rupee mili
 In such a situation, people would like to know which extraordinary business did the company do, due to which such a huge amount was deposited in the company's account? 5
 kya KISF financial sarvice (jo non banking financial sarvice company) ne jai shah kii company ko temple interprijej privet limited ko asurakshit rin diya tha?6
 Why did a cabinet minister have to come to the rescue of a private person? Is Jai Shah a member of the Union Cabinet and is he a national member of the BJP? So why is the government defending a private person's business dispute? 7
 kendriya kanoon mantri ne apane senior vakil or adishnal solicytor general tushaar mehta ko kyon ek nijee vyakti jai shah kaa bachaav karne kii vishesh ijaajat di?8
 Was it true that while there was an atmosphere of anger and pressure to take action in this case across the country, the RSS also spoke of an inquiry into the matter? 9
 is maamle main piem narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kab apni chuppi todenge? Maulana Salman Nadvi, who stood in favor of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, has claimed that he himself has been approached by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's team to resolve the Ayodhya dispute
 unhone ayodhya main honi vaali baithak ke baad piem modi se mulaakaat kii baat kahi
 Nadvi hoped that the Ram temple would be built on the same ground and we would reach a final solution
 nadvi ne kaha, main donon samudaayon ke liye ayodhya vivaad ke shantipurna samaadhaan par kaam karne ke liye apana sarvshereshth prayaas kar rahaa hum
 i felt emotional because i am trying to find some good solution that is acceptable in Islam
 lekin kuch log nihit swaarthon ke kaaran mujhe target kar rahe hai
 Salman Nadvi said that people like Owaisi are notorious for spreading hatred and unrest in society
 aise main ham unase kya ummid kar sakate hai?unhone kaha ki mujhe yakeen he ki ram mandir usee jameen par banegaa or ham antim samaadhaan tak pahunchenge
 Nadvi said that we will meet again in Ayodhya and discuss and find some solution to move forward
 unhone kaha ki haa, pradhanmantri narendra modi kii team ne unase aage kii karrwai or samaadhaan ke liye sampark kiya he
 We are talking on that we will meet the PM after the meeting in Ayodhya
 bataa den ki moulana salmaan nadvi ne pichley dinon aadhyatmik guru shri shri ravishankar ke saath mulaakaat karke kaha tha ki muslimon ko vivaadit jagah se apana daawa chhod dena chahie
 The mosque should be shifted elsewhere and a Ram temple should be built at the disputed site

 tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita ko pravasi bhartiya desh ke agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sabase yogya ummidavaar maanate hai
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is the most qualified candidate after Jayalalithaa in the eyes of migrants
 bhartiya pravaasiyon ke bich kiye gaye ek surveykshan ke buudhvaar ko hue khulaase main ye baaten saamne ain
 While Jayalalithaa received 86 out of 100 in this survey, Modi got 81 marks
 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi 53 ankon ke saath tisare sabase yogya ummidavaar chune gaye, vahiin anya netaaon main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke netaa laalkrishna adwani ko surveykshan main shaamil hone ke liye nunatam ank tak hasil nahin hua
 The 2002 communal riots in Gujarat and differences over Modi's candidature within the BJP also had an impact on migrants, as migrants preferred Jayalalithaa over Modi in terms of secular democracy and party influence
 shodhakartaaon main se ek pravasi pon mohaidin pichaai ne bataaya, 'hamane pratyaashiyon ko shortlist karne ke liye 10 moolbhoot sawaal puche, tathaa keval jayalalita, modi or rahul hi surveykshan main shaamil hone ke liye jaruri nunatam ank hasil kar sake

 The speech was only four minutes and in that also two minutes were of poetry
 mujhako sanam mili yaa meri rusavaai ho, kuch tarruf bhala is baat se kya he mujhako
 Few moments came at my age, in which i have received a lot of love from enemies
 kis tarah umr kaa dushwaar safar tay hoga, bich raste main koi chhod gaya he mujhako
 Along these soulful lines, 58-year-old Amar Singh finally expressed the pain of four years of separation with Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Mulayam Singh Yadav
 amar singh 5 agast ko lakhanu main janeshwar mishra park ke locarpan samaaroh main mulaayam singh yadav ke bulaave par aae the or manch kii agali paant main baithe the
 Although at the beginning of the speech, Amar Singh tried to stop the speculation by calling his presence non-political and extremely personal, but by then the implications of Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh's proximity in the political corridor were being explored
 janvari, 2010 main sapa se istipha dene ke baad yah pehla mauka tha, jab amar singh or mulaayam singh yadav ek saath ek manch par maujuud the
 After their separation, Amar Singh, during an event in Lucknow on 23 October 2010, accused Mulayam Singh of sacrificing Lohia's principles and promoting familism
 amar singh ne kaha tha, “sapa main sirf do apwaad the—ek janeshwar mishra or duusare amar singh
 One ate Ramji and the other Ram Gopal
 ” yah sanyog hi tha ki samaajawaadee netaa janeshwar mishra ke janmdin par amar singh ne sapa se dosti kii pingen badhaakar ek baar phir party ke bheetar apwaad banane kii disha main kadam badha diya he
 Amar Singh kept calling himself a Mulayamist, but he cleverly mentioned his new socialist form
 ve bole, “janeshwar ji mujhase kehete the ki tum kaise samaajawaadee ho? na to tumne chunaav ladaa, na jail gaye
 Now i have also gone to jail and have also contested elections
 aaj janeshwar ji jinda hote to main unase poochta ki aaj to main aapaki samaajawaadee paribhaasha par khara utarataa hum
 "professor of Department of Politics at Lucknow University, Dr
 ramesh dikshit kehete hai, “loksabhaa chunaav ke baad sapa or amar singh kendriya raajnneeti main kaaphi kamjor ho gaye hai
 Now both need each other
 ”takneekee taur par amar singh ab bhi rajyasabha main sapa ke cote se saansad hai or unka kaarykaal isi varsh november main khatm ho rahaa he
 He needs Mulayam Singh's friendship to go to the Rajya Sabha again
 haalanki in atakalon ko khaarij karte hue amar singh kehete hai ki ve rajyasabha main jane ke liye film abhinetri jaya bachchan kii tarah ochhaa kaam nahin karenge
 On the other hand, Mulayam Singh is worried about his national leader's image
 ve jald hi maharashtra samet kuch rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main badhibia pradarshan kar sapa ko hataasha se baahar nikaalnaa chaahate hai or isamen amar singh madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai
 Not only this, since assuming power in UP, the party does not have any face that can be the link between the government and the big industrialists of the country
 amar singh kii vaapasi kii atakalon ke bich party main unke ghor virdohi rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav or cabinet mantri ajam khan ne locarpan samaaroh se gaayab rahakar apni naaraazgi jaahir kar di he
 With this, a new round of tussle and tension within the SP has also started
 1- kamalnath ke karibiyon par red: CRPF or MP police main bhidnt, SSP ko ghar main ghusane se rokamadhyapradesh main pashchim bengal kii tarah police or kendriya agenciyon ke bich takaraav kii khabar aa rahi he
 Kamal Nath government police have reached Platinum Plaza and clashed with CRPF
 iske alaava police ne bhopal or indore main chhapemari ke thikaanon par ghusane kii koshish bhi kii
 Let me tell you, the Income Tax Department has raided the platinum plaza of Bhopal
 yahaan kii chhathi manzil par pratik joshi or ashvini sharma rahete hai
 2- Mayawati's message to Muslims- Do not let the votes be divided, nor let the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in West Uttar Pradesh fear the splitting of Muslim votes
 yahi vajah he ki saharanpur ke devband kii sanyukt raily main basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne muslimon ko baar-baar sachet karte hue kaha ki kisi bhi surat main apane vot ko bantane nahin dena
 The Congress is not fit to compete with the BJP, while the Grand Alliance has a strong base
 aise main apane voton kaa bikharaav mat karnaa or ekajute hokar gathbandhan ke ummidavaar ke paksh main vot karnaa
 3- JK: Farooq and Mehbooba, stunned at the decision of highway seal, refusal to obey the order has come to a boil in the politics of the valley on the highway ban in Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu kashmir kii purv siem or pidipi adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti ne saaf kaha he ki ve centre sarkaar ke is aadesh ko nahin maanati hai
 Tamtamayi Mehbooba said that these are our roads, this state is ours and we will come out on it whenever we want
 mahabuuba ne centre sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue kaha ve log kashmiriyon ko kuchalanaa chaahate hai, rajya kii aabaadi kaa pattern badalanaa chaahate hai, or kashmir ke logon ko apni jameen par kaid karnaa chaahate hai, aisa meri laash par hi hoga
 4 - Raid on the people close to Kamal Nath: Jaitley said - It has nothing to do with the government, the first reaction has come from the government regarding the raid of the Income Tax Department on the people close to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 modi sarkaar main vitt mantralay sambhaal rahe arun jetali ne kaha ki chunaav ayog or inakam tex jaisi agenciyaan chunaav ke dauraan kaale dhan par najar rakhti hai
 This is his job
 raajnneeti se iskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 They do not come to us and do not report
 5- fasebuk par chunavi vigyapanon par kharch 10 karod ke paar, bijepi sabase agechunaav najadik aane ke saath hi soshal media plateform fasebuk par raajnneetik dalon or unke samarthakon kii ore se prachaar abhiyaan jor pakad rahaa he
 In february-march this year, more than Rs 10 crore was spent on advertisements by political parties on Facebook
 fasebuk aid librari report ke anusaar, is saal farvari or 30 march ke bich 51,810 raajnneetik vigyapanon par 10
 Over 32 crore rupees were spent

 is himalayan desh se vishesh mitrataa darshane ke iraade se unhone is pad par asin hone ke baad pehali videsh yatra ke rup main vahaan jane kaa faisla kiya he
 The Prime Minister's decision to visit Thimphu as a first foreign visit is significant in the midst of China's efforts to establish full diplomatic relations with Bhutan
 bhutan kii do divasiy yatra ke dauraan vah vahaan ke naresh jigme khesar namagyal wangchuck or pradhanmantri shering tabge se bhent karenge
 During this time both countries will pay special attention to strengthening their relations and promoting trade and hydro-power projects
 modi ke saath videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal or videsh sachiv sujatha singh bhi jaaenge
 The Prime Minister will address the joint session of the National Assembly and National Council of Bhutan and will meet the Leader of the Opposition
 videsh sachiv ne bataaya, 'bhutan hamaara sabase mahatvapurn samrik partner he
 
 dakshin asia main achche padosiyon kii hamaari niti darshane ke liye yah bahut acha desh he
 He was questioned why Modi chose Bhutan as his first foreign trip
 unhone kaha, 'bhutan ke saath hamaare sambandh anuthe or garmjoshi se bhare hai
 The historical and cultural link between us makes us natural friends and partners
 ' When asked about China's efforts to forge closer ties with Bhutan, the Foreign Secretary said, Bhutan is a sovereign country and its leadership has to decide on it keeping in mind its interests
 bhutan kii 2013-18 kii 11ve panchavarshiya yojana ke liye bharat 4500 karod rupayon kii package sahaayta dene ke saath uske dhanchaagat kshetron or soochna evam sanchaar praudyogiki se lekar swasthya, krishi, maanav sansaadhan vikaas tathaa paryaton aadi main sahyog kar rahaa he
 Sujata Singh said that India is supporting 16 important projects in Bhutan including hydroelectricity, cement and information technology
 iske alaava bharat skulon, pustakaalayon, hostal suvidhaon, pashu chikitsaalayon, sinchai channelon, peyajal yojanaon or saamudayik kendron jaise bhutan kii aam janata ko laabh pahunchane vaale kaaryon se bhi judaa he
 Cooperation in hydropower sector between the two countries is proving very beneficial for both Bhutan and India
 donon deshon ke bich 3 pen bijli pariyojnaayen pehle hi hai or kuch anya ke liye bhi samjhaute hue hai
 Bilateral trade between Bhutan and India in 2012 amounted to 6830 crores rupees
 modi bhutan naresh or vahaan ke pradhanmantri ke nimantran par ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister of Bhutan was present on 26 May at a grand ceremony to make Modi the Prime Minister's oath
 vaise to gujarat ke siem narendra modi suraksha main dhilaai ke masale par centre sarkaar par hamalaa karne kaa koi bhi mauka nahin ganvaate hai
 But this time the case has turned somewhat backwards
 ab sieji ne modi ke apane hi pradesh main suraksha-vyavastha main gambhir khaamiyon ko ujagar kiya he
 The latest CAG report was presented in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly on Thursday
 isamen sieji ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he ki kis tarah narendra modi gujarat kii samudri seemaa ko surakshit banane main naakaam rahe
 The CAG has criticized the Modi government for failing to implement the coastal security scheme passed by the Ministry of Home Affairs in January 2005
 sieji kii yah report hamaare sahyogi channel 'hedlins today' ke paas bhi he, jisamen vistaar se bataaya gaya he ki apane tat kii suraksha karne main kis tarah modi sarkaar fail hui
 According to the Centre's plan, 10 coastal police stations, 25 coastal check posts and 46 coastal out posts were to be built in Gujarat
 is kaam ke liye 30 boat, vaahan, furniture aadi sajo-saamaan gujarat ko muhaiyaa kara die gaye the
 Despite this, the Modi government did not take any steps to implement the entire scheme
 usne rajya ke fund se iske liye kuch bhi nahin kharch kiya
 Not only this, the work of building 5 police stations on the coast was also delayed
 anya police stesan banane ke kaam main istemaal kancreet kii quality kharaab thi
 The work of making 50 check posts and out posts was completed, but work on 36 of them could not be started
 in jagahon par pulicekarmiyon kii tainaati nahin kii gai
 Also, the token system designed to monitor the movement of fishermen and their boats was ineffective
 baharhaal, sieji ke taaja khulaase ke baad is masale par siyasat or garma sakati he
 Modi, who shot an arrow at others, has himself become a target this time

 About 67 out of 99 crore voters

 Nadisutra: In the Three / Ganges / Gangotriksi Purana it is written that four rivers, originating from the Sumeru mountain, originate in four directions
 aap agar nakshaa dekhen to baat kuch spasht hogi
 Between Badrinath and Kedarnath, the place is probably named badrinath-chaukhamba because of the four pillars about seven thousand meters high
 chowkhamba ke crode gangotri se ganga nikalati he jo lagbhag uttar-pashchim disha main pachis kilometre yatra kar gomukh main bhagirathi ko janm detii he
 To the north-east of Chaukhamba are the Satopanth Banka and Bhagirathi glaciers which give rise to the Alaknanda
 chowkhamba ke pandrah kilometre pashchim main sumeru parvat he jiske crode main se nikle himand se mandakini kaa janm hota he
 Yamunotri is almost to the northwest of Sumeru mountain
 ab pataa nahin puraanon main jo chaar nadiyon ke chaar dishaao main nikalne kii baat he vah isi sumeru se in chaar nadiyon kii baat he yaa uskaa arth sindhu, brahmaputra, ganga or satluj se he
 Gomukh glacier is the main source of Ganges water
 gangotri se atharah kilometre upar himalay main sthit
 It is one of the largest glaciers in the Himalayas, about 27 cubic kilometers large
 kuch adhyayan bataate hai ki isaki gaharaai lagbhag 200 meter he
 Scientists say that glaciers are formed when long layers of snow accumulate on top of each other
 him kii yah paraten kai sau foot moti himandon kaa rup le leti hai
 The Gangotri glacier would have been like this too
 hajaaron varshon kaa itihaas samete
 But for the people here all these are just bookish things
 jis gupha se yah himand nikalataa vah he gomukh
 Gomukh means cow's face
 jis gupha se ganga nadi nikalati he vah kabhi bilkul aisa hi tha
 The journey from Gangotri to Gomukh is not easy
 agar aap usee din waapas aana chaahate hai to kanpakapaati sardi main tadake chaar baje nikalnaa padegaa
 If you want, you can also take a night's rest in Bhojbasa
 bhojaptr ke pedo kii adhikta ke kaaran hi is sthaan kaa naam bhojwasa padaa tha, lekin ab to is jagah bhoj vriksh ginati ke hi bache hai
 The lack of oxygen starts from Gangotri itself
 gomukh ko samajhane kii koshish kai shodhakarta saalon se kar rahe hai
 Scientists have been screaming for the past several years that the Gomukh glacier is melting
 pehle se kahi zyada tej gati se
 Sometimes 26 km long and about 3 in Gomukh region
 5 kimi chaudaa glacier tha jo ab do-dhai kimi peeche sarak gaya he
 Apparently, global warming is being blamed for this, in which permafrost i
e
 snow-frozen areas and glaciers are also being melted for years
 shodh hona baaki he ki kya yah har him yug ke baad aane vaala bhugolic bhashaa main garm daur kaa hissaa he yaa atyadhik insaani gatividhiyon or badhati aabaadi ne is par apana bahucharchit asar daalaa he
 Will anyone ever believe that here, the extreme ranges of the Himalayas, whose height will sometimes be shaken by the rocking of the sky, have been part of the foothills of the ocean? Strange, but true
 bhugol kaa har chaatr apane vishay kii buniyadi padhai yaheen se shuru karata he
 It was the Tethys Sea
 bhugol ne ise sabit kiya he kyonki himalay kii chotiyon ke pattharon main machhliyon ke jeevashm mili hai
 Glaciers, ie, glaciers, change their form
 kuch samay se unke aakaar main kami ai he
 The prevailing theories and beliefs of climate change say that due to greenhouse effect and other similar reasons, global temperature is registering an increase, and the snowfall of mountains is decreasing rapidly
 jiyological survey of india kii report bataati he ki 1935 se 1976 tak hi gomukh glacier 775 meter peeche sarak gaya tha
 While reading this i remembered the geographer Griffith Taylor
 vikaas or paryaavaran ke dwandv main mujhe hameshaa griphith tailor yaad aate hai
 He had spoken of favoring the 'stop and go' policy regarding models of development
 unhone kaha tha ki andhaadhudh vikaas ke kaamon ko shuru karne se pehle hameshaa uski satatta ke bare main vichaar karnaa chahie
 In the blind race of perceived development, we do not get a chance to think about sustainable or sustainable development
 glacier hai to nadiyaan hai, nadiyaan hai to jal, jangal, or maanav sabhyataa or jivan he
 But the truth is that 36 cities classified as class one cities in the Ganges basin add 96 percent of the waste to the river waste
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board kii 2013 kii report ke mutabik nadi ke kinare based shahar rojaanaa 2,723 million litre gharelu sivej is nadi main hi pravaahit karte hai
 But this is only an estimate and the reality can be more frightening than this, because the Board's estimate of the amount of water supply in cities
 kya aapako lagata he ki shaharon main jitna pani istemaal hota he utana pani nigam vaale vaaki supplai karte hai? har shahar main handpump or kuen jaise alahada saadhan bhi hote hai
 CPCB found that 6,000 million liters of sewage is dumped into the Ganges daily through drains
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki hamaare shaharon main is sivej ko upachaarit (treet) karne kii kshamta behad kam he
 Very rarely, if we consider two facts
 pehali baat, sivej paidaa hone or uske upachaar ke bich kaa antar har saal 55 fisadi kaa he
 This also means that even if we add more capacity in sewage treatment, this difference will remain due to increase in population
 aabaadi main badhotari or sivej discharge kii vaastavik maatra ke anumaan ko saath rakhkar gananaa kii jaae to pataa chalata he ki hamaari treetment kii kshamta or sivej utpaadan ke bich kaa antar 80 fisadi tak bad jaataa he
 The plains have at least 764 industrial units along the Ganga's main stream and its two tributaries, the Ram Ganga and the Kali River, which pour 500 MLD of toxic waste into the river
 ganga ke saath dikkat yah he ki iske kinare adhiktar shaharon main bhumigat sivej system bhi nahin he

 However, the question arises now that due to the rules of the Central Government, now one can be convicted if one currency is found in this currency? doklam ko lekar bharat ke saath chal rahi tanatani ke bich china ab is masale par nepal ko apane saath laane kii koshish main jute gaye hai
 It is under this that Chinese diplomats have told Nepalese officials their stand on the issue
 angreji akhbaar da times of india ne rajanyik sutron ke hawaale se prakashit report main bataaya kidoklam muddaper china ke mishan upapramukh ne apane navnirvaachit nepali samakaksh ke saath shishtachar bhent main doklam mudde par charchaa kii or ise lekar china ke rukh se avgat karaayaa
 Let me tell you that through dialogue, Doklam is insisting on a solution
 vahiin china is baat par ada he ki doklam mudde par kisi bhi tarah kii arthpurna vaarta ke liye bharat ko pehle vahaan se apane sainik hataanaa hoga
 According to this report, similar meetings have been held between officials in China and Nepal in Kathmandu and Beijing
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah bhi he ki bharat is masale ko trek-2 diplomasi ke jariye bhi sulajhane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 According to sources, India discussed the issue with US diplomats a few weeks ago
 bataa den ki nepal ke saath is mudde par charchaa karne kaa china kaa yah faisla do vajahon se ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Firstly, India shares a trifunction with China and Nepal in this disputed region
 vahiin duusari vajah yah he ki bharat beete kuch vakt se padosi mulk nepal par prabhaav banaae rakhane ko lekar sangharsh kar rahaa he
 Nepal actually shares two trifunctions with China and India
 pehla pashchimi nepal ke lipulekh main or doosraa purvi hisse sthit jinsang chuli main sthit he
 Both India and Nepal have claimed the Lipulekh area in the disputed Kalapani area, which Nepal has already been worried about
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2015 main apni china yatra ke dauraan lipulekh paas ke jariye china ke saath vyapaar badhaane kaa faisla liya tha
 There was a lot of resentment in Nepal about this step and there was a demand in Parliament that the mention of the script in the india-china joint statement should be removed, because it is against international rules
 nepali sansad ne yah bhi jaananaa chaha tha ki kya yah samjhaute nepal kii samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta ko kamatar to nahin kar rahaa
 It is also worth noting here that big leaders of India and China are going to visit Nepal this month
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj jahaan BIMSTEC kii baithak ke liye agle hafte kathmandu jaaengi, vahiin, china ke up pradhanmantri wang yang bhi 14 agast ko sheersh netaaon se mulaakaat karne nepal main honge
 In such a situation, it is expected that both Sushma and Yang will discuss the Doklam dispute
 sushamaa swaraj jahaan nepali pradhanmantri sher bahadur deuba kii agle maheene hone vaali bharat yatra kaa khaakaa khinchengi
 Actually there is a large anti-india section in Nepal and Indian officials know that supporters of former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli can present India as an intruder on the Doklam issue
 vahiin sushamaa ke thik baad hone vaali chini up pradhanmantri kii yatra par bhi sabaki nazren tiki hongi, kyonki isamen china ke van velt van road (OBOR) project main nepal ke shaamil hone ke faisle ke aage kaa rasta tay ho saktaa he
 Despite India's objections, Nepal agreed to join the project
