 satta ke do prabal daavedaar-lalu prasad yadav kaa rashtriya janata dal (rajd) or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa janata dal (you)-is khel main sabase aage najar aa rahe hai
 If Nitish went to a 'social meet' at the ancestral residence of murder convict and former MP Anand Mohan, where Anand Mohan's mother blessed him; So Lalu Prasad reached Siwan's jail to meet Mohammad Shahabuddin
 lalu or nitish, donon hi sanghathanaatmak khaamiyon or paaramparik janaadhar main ai giravat se nibatane ke liye aakhri samay main sameekaran durust karne kii kavayad main jute hai
 He has demonstrated sufficient flexibility in bringing tainted Bahubali leaders - Prabhunath Singh and former Union Minister Taslimuddin - from the enemy camp
 haalanki lalu prasad ne to raajnneeti ke apradheekaran ke khilaaf kabhi koi rukh nahin apanaaya, lekin nitish ke vyavhaar main yah badlaav vaaki chaunkaane vaala he kyonki ve hameshaa se saaf raajnneeti kii kasame khate aae hai
 He seems to have turned his eyes towards what is politically justified and inappropriate
 udhaaharan ke liye, police ne varasaliganj ke nirdaleey vidhayak pradeep mahato ko khulaa chhod rakhaa he, jabaki unke khilaaf ek maamle main kai aaropon (jisamen hatya ke aarope bhi shaamil hai) ke chalate warrant jari he
 Despite the warrant, Mahato is seen sharing the stage with Nitish
 isamen koi tajjub nahin ki lalu prasad bhi kaaphi jaldbaaji main he kyonki kahin aisa na ho ki unase pehle nitish kisi bahubali par haath saaf kar len
 Soon after Nitish's visit to Anand Mohan's house, RJD Principal General Secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Kripal Yadav went to Saharsa jail twice to 'discuss politics' with the jailed former MP
 anand mohan 1994 main gopalganj ke jila magistrate ji
 He is serving a life sentence for the murder of Krishnaiah in the street
 bihar main raajnneeti ke sheersh khilaadiyon kii samaveshi raajnneeti ke is nae brands par amal karne ke saath hi isane achche-acchon ko hairat main daal diya he
 Both have expressed their nervousness as Lalu and Nitish's fate is largely at stake in the upcoming election
 jahaan lalu is chunavi mahapralay main doobane se khud ko bachane kii har sambhav koshish main jute hai, vahiin nitish kii koshish kisi bhi tarah unhen isamen dubo dene kii he
 Probably, therefore, these two leaders do not seem to be in the mood to leave any chance to satisfy the Bahubalis
 isse jaahir he ki lalu or nitish anand mohan ko bahalane main kyon lage hai, jabaki ve yah tathy bhul jate hai ki unki patni lavali anand ko 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 81,479 vot mili the or ve shivahar se congress ke tikat par chauthe sthaan par rahi thim
 If something similar happens this time, it will be very effective for the assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav ke vipareet, vidhansabha chunaav main jeet kaa antar anupatik myanon main kaaphi kam rahata he
 64 in Bihar during the 1998 Lok Sabha elections
 6 fisadi matdaan hua tha
 a year later the voting figure was 61
 48 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 5 of the state in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 44 karod matadaataaon main se sirf 44 fisadi ne hi apane matadhikaar kaa prayog kiya
 Due to the declining trend of voting, Bahubalis have also been asked because they are expected to get some votes
 baharhaal, yah tark bahubaliyon ke liye bihar kii ore netaaon ke jhukaav ko bhale jaahir kare lekin unke bahubali hdhem ko sahi nahin tehra saktaa
 In fact, Shahabuddin, Anand Mohan, Pappu Yadav, Surajbhan and Munna Shukla are slightly different from other Bahubalis in Bahubali politics, not because they can contest elections but these people because they have been convicted
 ve gangster bhi the to apni jati ke agua hone ke saath-saath thekedaar or janpratinidhi the
 He played his part in a landscape where the line dividing the leaders and criminals had disappeared long ago
 isamen koi hairat nahin ki ye bahubali us sahajata ke pratik the jiske jariye ye aasaani se bihar kii raajnneeti main apana dabadabaa kaayam kar lete the
 Besides wearing their various masks, they used to mix crime and politics very well
 bihar ke vividh or vibhinn guton main bante samaaj main anand mohan or shahabuddin sareekhe aparaadhiyon ko jati yaa samudaay ke nayak ke taur par sammaan diya jaataa he
 Says sociologist Hetukar Jha, "apart from being a major qualifier of sharing power in Bihar, caste has always played a decisive role in providing support and shelter
 yahaan, jati rajnatik or vichaardhaaratmak patibaddhtaon ko aakaar dene main ahm bhoomika adaa karti he
 "the more things change, the more they remain the same

 In his blog, Big b has written that many early moments of our life moving towards the peaks of progress are easily forgotten
 meraa maananaa he ki apane shuruaati dinon, uski paristhitiyon or halaat ko eemaandaaree se yaad rakhana har kisi ko vaastaviktaa ke dharaatal par khadaa rakhata he
 The actor, who has given success in films like Wall, Daan, Sholay, Coolie, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham and Black, has said that he struggled a lot during four decades in Bollywood
 unka maananaa he ki kharaab anubhav se mila paath jivan main hameshaa kaam aata he
 He further wrote, 'the past golden days, the difficult times and how to overcome them, the disappointment of failures all play an important role for the present and the times ahead
 ab tak ke anubhav ko yaad rakhana phir nae sire se shuru karnaa behatar hota he

 guuruuvaar ko jab sheetakaaleen satr se pehle bulaae jane vaali sarvadaleey baithak hui to vipaksh ne apana iraadaa saaf kar diya
 So there are more chances of uproar and less of work
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki aaj loksabhaa kii kaarywahi tiemasi saansad sultan ahamed ko shradhanjali dekar sthagit ho sakati he

 a 14-year-old teenager died after being thrown out of a bat by an angry batsman for being out during a cricket match in Bangladesh
 police ke mutabik, yah ghatana ek dostana match ke dauraan hui
 Police Commissioner Jahangir Alam told that at the time of this incident near Chittagong, Faizal Hussain was fielding, this stump went to him
 unhone bataaya ki ballebaaj ko jab pataa laga ki vah stump yaa bold ho gaya he to vah naaraaz ho gaya
 In anger, he lifted the stump and bounced it in the air, which was placed in the neck and head of Faizal, fielding nearby

 He was declared dead when taken to the hospital
 police ke mutabik, ballebaaj ko hiraasat main le liya gaya or gaiyr iradatan maut ke maamle main us par cese chalaaya jayega
 It is worth mentioning that earlier in May last year in Bangladesh, a similar incident took place when a batsman was beaten to death by the stump of a 16-year-old cricketer, who was angry with taunting the umpire with a 'no ball'
 16 saal kaa babul shikdaar pichley saal dhaka main apane doston ke saath ek match khel rahaa tha, jab uski stump se petakar hatya kar di gai thi
 According to the police, the umpire gave the decision in favor of the batsman by giving a no ball
 ampire ne pichhali gend ko bhi no ball qaraar diya tha
 At this, Shikar taunted the umpire
 is taane se ballebaaj itnaa naaraaz ho gaya ki usne stump uthaakar shikdaar ko sir ke peeche de maaraa
 He fell on the ground and died on his way to the hospital
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bangladesh main pichley saal may main bhi is tarah kii ghatana hui thi jab ek ballebaaj ne 'no ball' ko lekar ampaire par taana maarane se naaraaz hokar ek 16 saal ke cricketer kii stump se petakar jaan le lee thi
 16-year-old Babul Shikdar was playing a match with his friends in Dhaka last year when he was beaten to death
 police ke anusaar ampire ne no ball dekar ballebaaj ke paksh main faisla diya
 The umpire had also called the previous ball as no ball
 is par shikdaar ne ampaire par taana maar diya
 The taunts made the batsman so angry that he lifted the stump and hit Shikdar on the back of the head
 vah maidan par gir gaya or aspataal jate samay uski maut ho gai

 com / mqmsiyl4jm— BCCI (@bcci)october 29, 2017 The duty of a son is considered meaningful only when he serves the parents during his lifetime, and after his death, duly perform Shraddha on his death date (barsi) and Mahalaya (pitrupaksha)
 is varsh shraadh kaa pakhwada (pitrupaksh) nau sitambar se prarambh ho rahaa he
 The basic idea of shraddha is based on the karmism and rebirthism of Vedic philosophy
 kaha gaya he ki aatma amar he, jiskaa naash nahin hota
 Shraddha means reverence to its gods, ancestors and lineage
 manyata he ki jo log apana sharir chhod jate hai, ve kisi bhi lok main yaa kisi bhi rup main hon, shraadh pakhwaade main prithvi par aate hai or shraadh va tarpan se trupt hote hai
 According to Hindu beliefs, Pindadan is an easy and simple path to salvation
 yon to desh ke kai sthanon main pindadaan kiya jaataa he, parantu bihar ke phalgu tat par based gaya main pindadaan kaa bahut mahatv he
 It is said that Lord Rama and Goddess Sita also performed pindadan in Gaya for the peace of King Dasharatha's soul
 mahabharat main likhaa he ki phalgu tirth main snaan karke jo manushya shraadhpaksh main bhagwaan gadadhar (bhagwaan vishnu) ke darshan karata he, vah pitaron ke rin se vimukt ho jaataa he
 It is said that Pinddan, Tarpan and Brahmin food are the three main functions in the Phalgu Shraddha
 pitrupaksh main karmkand kaa vidhi va vidhaan alag-alag he
 Devotees perform one day, three days, seven days, fifteen days and 17 days of rituals
 gaya ko vishnu kaa nagar mana gaya he
 It is called the land of salvation
 vishnu puraana or vaayu puraana main bhi isaki charchaa kii gai he
 According to Vishnu Purana, by performing the pindadan in Gaya, the ancestors get salvation and they reside in heaven
 mana jaataa he ki swayan vishnu yahaan pitru devtaa ke rup main maujuud hai, isliye ise 'pitru tirth' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Panda Devavrata of Gaya told that without offering pinddaan on the banks of river Phalgu, pindadan cannot be done
 pindadaan kii prakriya punpun nadi ke kinare se prarambh hoti he
 According to legends, a demon named Gaiasur in the lineage of Bhasmasura sought a boon from Brahma by performing hard penance to make his body as holy as the gods and people be freed from mere sin
 use yah vardaan to mila, lekin dushprinaam yah hua ki swarg kii jansankhya badhane lagi or sab kuch prakritik niyam ke vipareet hone laga, kyonki log bina bhay ke paap karne lage or gayasur ke darshan se paap mukt hone lage
 To avoid this, the Gods demanded a holy place for Yajna from Gyaasura
 gayasur ne apana sharir devataaon ko yajna ke liye de diya
 When the demon Gayaasur lay down, his body spread in five Kos
 yahi paanch kos kii jagah aage chalakar gaya kahalaai
 Gayaasur's heart however did not wish to free the people from sin and he again asked for a boon from the Gods that this place should remain the people
 jo bhi log yahaan par pindadaan karen, unke pitaron ko mukti mili
 This is the reason that even today people come to Gaya to worship their fathers
 vidwaanon ke mutabik, kisi vastu ke golakar rup ko pind kaha jaataa he
 In symbolic form, the body is also called a body
 pindadaan ke samay mritak ke nimitt arpit kiye jane vaale padaarth, jisamen jau yaa chaaval ke aante ko goonthkar banaaya gaya golakriti pind kehalaata he
 Pindadan is known as pindadan, offering its panekas with reverence to the objects made by mixing rice, cow's milk, ghee, sugar and honey, while facing south, placing their janeu on the right shoulder
 jal main kaale til, jau, kusha evam safed phool milkaar us jal se vidhipurvak tarpan kiya jaataa
 It is believed that this makes the fathers satisfied
 iske baad shraadh ke baad brahman ko bhojan karaayaa jaataa he
 According to the pandas, the place of fathers is said to be very high in the scriptures
 pitaron kii shrenee main mrit mata, pita, dada, daadi, naanaa, nani sahit sabhi purvaj shaamil hai
 From a broad view, the dead Guru and Acharya also fall under the category of ancestors
 kaha jaataa he ki gaya main pehle vibhinn naamon kii 360 vediyaan thim jahaan pindadaan kiya jaataa tha
 Of these, only 48 are left
 haalanki kai dharmik sansthaaen un puraani vediyon kii khoj kii maang kar rahi hai
 At this time, at these 48 altars, people offer sacrifices and pindadan of the ancestors
 yahaan kii vediyon main vishnupad mandir, phalgu nadi ke kinare or akshayavat ke neeche pindadaan karnaa jaruri mana jaataa he
 It is worth mentioning that 55 places including Haridwar, Gangasagar, Jagannathpuri, Kurukshetra, Chitrakoot, Pushkar, Badrinath have been considered important for Shraddh in the country
 inamen gaya kaa sthaan sarvopari kaha gaya he
 The Garuda Purana states that every step one walks on leaving the house to go to Gaya forms a ladder for the ascension of the ancestors
 sanyasi varg apana shraadh apane jeevankaal main hi kar lete hai
 It is described in Garuda Purana and Matsya Purana that the things offered by reverence are received by the ancestors in the folk in which they live
 log shraadh ke dauraan kauwon, kutton or gaayon ke liye bhi ansh nikaalte hai
 It is believed that the dog and the crow are close to Yama and the cow crosses the Vaitarani

 In the next over, Sehwag had his neighbor Pradeep Sangwan of Najafgarh and the Daredevils captain hit him with two fours and a six at midwicket
 jayavardhane ne iskaa jashn rajat bhaatia ke agle over main chauke or becoward squaire leg par lagaaye gayi chakke se manaaya
 Running in poor form, Ross Taylor was playing very slow and in such a situation, Jayawardene also had the responsibility of scoring fast runs

 He played 27 balls and hit three fours and a six
 tailor kaa sangharsh aakhir main sangwan kii gend hawa main lahraane ke saath samaapt hua

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday once again claimed that the incidence of crime in the state has come down but he is also offended by the crimes
 nitish ne adhikariyon ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki samay par nishpakshta ke saath kaam kiijie or gadabad karne waalon ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 Nitish was addressing police officers after inauguration of 'dial 100' in Patna on Tuesday
 unhone ab har hafte thana prabhariyon ko anchal ke adhikariyon ke saath samiksha baithak karne ke alaava har pakhwaade jila ke str par jila adhikari or espi ko aparaadh or uske kaarnon par samiksha baithak karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 After this, the Director General of Police and Home Secretary of the state will review
 nitish kaa kahana tha ki agar gambhirthapurvak samvedansheeltaa ke saath samiksha hogi to rajya main aparaadhon main bahut kami aegi
 The comments pichley ek hafte ke dauraan rajya main aparaadh kii do badi ghatnaayen huin jisamen mujffarpur main purv meyar samir kumaar kii hatya shaamil he
 Referring to these incidents, Nitish said that these murders are related to land disputes
 unke anusaar rajya main vikaas kaa kaam jaise sadak kaa nirmaan, bijli kii haalat main sudhaar ke baad jameen ke daamon main betahasha vruddhi hui he
 According to him, if the administration does not keep a sharp eye, then such incidents will happen
 nitish ne is kaarykram main yah bhi kaha ki thane main posting ke samay saamaajik balance kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 But the question arises from this statement of Nitish whether posting will be done on the basis of caste or on the basis of good work of an officer
 nitish mangalvaar ko patna main 'dial 100' ke udghaatan ke baad police adhikariyon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 He has now directed the station in-charge to hold a review meeting with the officers of the zone every week and every fortnight at the district level, the district officer and the SP to hold a review meeting on crime and its causes
 iske baad rajya ke police mahanideshak or grih sachiv samiksha karenge
 Nitish said that if there is a serious sensitivity review, there will be a lot of reduction in crimes in the state
 tippaniyan There have been two major incidents of crime in the state during the last one week including the murder of former Mayor Sameer Kumar in Muzaffarpur
 in ghatnaon kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki yah hatya zamin ke vivaad se judi hai
 According to him, the prices of land have increased wildly after the development work in the state like construction of road, improvement in the condition of electricity
 unke anusaar agar prashasan tikhi nazar nahin rakhega to aisi ghatnaayen hoti rahengi
 Nitish also said in this program that social balance should also be taken care of at the time of posting in the police station
 lekin nitish ke is bayaan se sawaal ye uthta he ki kya jati ke aadhaar par ab posting kii jaaengi yaa kisi adhikari ke achche kaam ke aadhaar par

 One was The Legend of Bhagat Singh, directed by Ajay Devgan starrer and Rajkumar Santoshi
 duusari, 23 march 1931: shahid, bobi deol or sani deol starer
 Now on November 7, National Award winner Ayushmann Khurrana's film Bala and on November 8 Sunny Singh's Ujra Chaman are going to hit the screens
 donon hi filmon ke trailor or posters saamne aa chuke hai
 The subject of the film is similar
 donon hi star film main ganje hai
 In such a situation, comparison between the two films is bound to happen
 soshal media par donon filmon kii khub tulana kii ja rahi he
 Let's know who was heavy in the trailer of both the films
 storilindonon hi filmon kaa subject to ek jaisaa he, lekin storiline main thodaa fark he
 On one hand in Bala, where Ayushman Khurana, along with his troubles, also shows how it makes a difference to the other people associated with him
 vahiin sani singh khud main hi simat kar rah gaye
 Even more issues have been raised with Ayushmann's troubles in Bala
 jaise sirf gauri ladkiyaan hi chahie
 The one who is Gaura is beautiful there
 film actress bhoomi pednekar kaa rang bhi saanwala dikhaaya he
 At the same time, the focus is on Sunny's troubles in Ujra Chaman
 lukluk kii agar baat karen to donon hi star ke luk lagbhag ek jaise hai
 Both are bald in the film
 sani singh kaa luk film main bahut hi shandaar he
 His look seems very real
 vahiin ayushmaan bhi apane kairactor main kaaphi involve najar aae
 Talking about Star Power, it is obvious that Ayushman Khurana is far ahead of Sunny Singh
 ayushmaan khurana neshnal aword bhi jeet chuke hai
 Apart from this, he has given many hit films like Andhadhun, Dream Girl and Badhaai Ho
 vahiin sani singh kii ye pehali film he jisamen wo lead role main najar aane vaale hai
 Prior to this, he has done films like Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, Pyar Ka Panchanama

 The recent celebrations on the occasion of the release of the first consignment of Indian wheat sent to Afghanistan via Chabahar port after the completion of the "transport and Transit" Agreement between India, Iran and Afghanistan in May 2016 Was important and also full of possibilities
 kuch hi samay pehle isi saal june main bharat-afghanistan air fret coridor bhi shuru kiya gaya tha
 Due to the partition of India in 1947, many of our trade and transit routes with the countries of the west were closed for centuries
 yah nuksaan fori taur par mahasoos nahin hua kyonki hamaara videshi vyapaar maatra main bahut kam tha or duniyabar main rashtriya simaaen bahut zyada paband thim
 This situation changed in the post-cold War era
 nirantar vaishvikrut hoti duniya main kisi ilaake ke darmyaan or ilaakon ke bich main behatar sampark kii anivaaryta mahasoos kii jane lagi
 Our export capabilities grew, there was a need to increase contacts with the newly liberated countries of Central Asia, and after the end of the Taliban regime, our return to Afghanistan became an important trade and economic ally
 in sabase bhi yah lagane laga ki pashchim kii disha main hamaare pargaman raaston ko phir se behaal kiya janaa chahie
 But as a perfect example of cutting off its nose to save its face, Pakistan has continued to refuse and even clamor for lucrative trade and transit contacts with India — bilaterally and under the SAARC framework 
 yah ravaiya uski is niti ke bhi anuroop he jisamen vah bharat ke liye afghanistan main koi bhoomika nahin dekhtaa taaki us desh par uskaa dabadabaa kaayam rah sake
 The idea of using Iran as a transit route was first born in the 1990s in the context of reaching our reach in Central Asia
 afghanistan or usase aage pahunch banane ke liye chabahaar bandargah kaa istemaal karne kaa maamla 2003 ke baad se hi ataki padi baatcheet main shaamil to rahaa lekin usamen koi khaas tarakkee na ho saki kyonki iran ke khilaaf america ne paabandiyaan laga rakhi thim
 The Iran nuclear deal then changed the situation and resulted in the signing of the trilateral agreement in 2016
 isamen chabahaar bandargah kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat or saath hi bharat dwaara bandargah or sambhddha dhanchaagat suvidhaon ke vikaas ke liye 50 karod dollar kaa nivesh karne kii patibaddhta shaamil thi
 The port is connected to the border Afghan city of Zaranj in Nimruz province via an Iranian road network
 jaranj se hi hamane padosi farah praant main delaram ke liye 200 kilometre lambii sadak bhi banaai thi jiske liye 600 karod ru
 We had paid a huge price in the form of the expenses of and the lives of Indian and Afghan security forces in Taliban attacks
 yah sadak 2009 main afghanistan ke supurd kar di gai thi or yah pramukh afgaan shaharon ko jodgaye vaale garland (maala) rajmarg se jaakar judati he
 Against this backdrop, the wheat consignment is an important achievement in our attempt to circumvent its short-sighted dogma to not allow transit routes to develop in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Central Asia and beyond (connecting Russia and Europe)
 haalanki is raste main bhi aage badaae main kuch anischitataayen ho sakati hai
 Firstly, it will be necessary that the port development project is completed in time and uninterrupted transit process is created
 prashasnic baadhaon se ladi koi bhi prakriya baaki lambey lekin kushal pargaman raaston kii tulana main chote pargaman raste ke phaayde ko chin legi
 Secondly, the use of this route will depend on Iran and Afghanistan
 jaise-jaise hamaari nirbharta badhegi, iran apane bhugolic laabh kaa istemaal hamaare saath samgr rishton ke sandarbh main karnaa chahega
 However, due to the attractiveness of an active port and our capable diplomacy, this aspect should be tackled
 phir, afghanistan kii najuk sthiti ke kaaran prastaavit pargaman raste ko usee tarah ke khataron kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he jaisaa ki china kii china-pakistan aarthik galiyara (sipiisi) ko pakistan main saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Another matter of concern is US President Donald Trump's decision not to certify that Iran is following all the terms of the nuclear deal
 isse iran par taaja america paabandiyon kaa khatra bad gaya he
 In such a situation, one can only hope that the US will hold on to the assurances of its foreign minister Rex Tillerson that he had given during his recent visit to India that he would have some kind of interference in any statutory agreements already in business activities
 will not give

 ) There is talk of bringing more and more women into politics from different parties, claims are being made to pursue them not for years now
 lekin kya mahilaon ko raajnneeti main wo sthaan, wo sammaan, wo jimmedaari mil rahi he jisaki wo hakdaar hai or jiske liye wo puri tarah se sakasham hai?khokhale hai mahilaon ko raajnneeti main aage laane ke davehakeekat ye he ki mahilaon ko raajnneeti main aage laane ke daawey khokhale hai
 If it is said that the politics of Delhi is a mirror of the country's politics to a large extent, then it will not be wrong
 isi aaine ko dekhakar ye to pataa chalata he ki dilli kii raajnneeti main mahilaon kii lagaataar upeksha ho rahi he
 Statistics show that at present only 4 women participation in Delhi Legislative Assembly
 28 fisadi he or isse zyada sharmnaak baat ye he ki aaj se 20 saal pehle bhi vidhansabha main inkaa pratishat itnaa hi tha
 Women are moving ahead defeating every challenge, but they are beating the politics on the board
 yahi dilli kii raajnneeti kii kadavi sachai he
 At present there are only 3 women in the 70-member Delhi Assembly
 har baar chunaavon main mahilaon ko raajnneeti main laane ke, tikat dene ke joardaar daawey to hote hai, lekin agar pichhali 4 vidhansabhaon main mahilaon ke aankadon par najar daalen to apane aap hi hakeekat samaj main aa jaaegi
 Statistics show that
 
 
 -varsh 1993 kii dilli vidhansabha main 3 mahilaayein chun kar pahunchi thi
 In 1998, the highest number of 9 women reached the assembly and their percentage was about 13 in the team of 70 members, but in the year 2003, where 7 women got a chance to come to the assembly, in the 2008 assembly, the number of women in the present assembly was only 3 is left
 yani pichley 20 saalon main raajnneeti main mahilaayein jahaan khadi thi aaj bhi vahiin khadi najar aati hai
 According to former Delhi Assembly Secretary SK Sharma, it is absolutely true that no party is giving women a chance to come forward
 duuta kii purv sadsy nitu verma bhi kahati hai ki aaj bhi raajnneeti purush pradhan he or mahilaon ko aage aane ke kam maukey die jate hai
 This is strange irony
 
 
 vaise ye ek ajeeb vidambnaa hi he ki jis dilli rajya kii kaman pichley 15 saal se ek mahila yani shila dikshit ke haath main he, iske baavjood mahilaon ko raajnneeti main aane kaa mauka nahin mil rahaa
 Former DUTA president Alka Lamba says that it has been a long time for 18 years in politics, she is not getting a chance to move forward
 aaj na raajnneeti main mere liye jagah he na hi kisi or prophashan main main apane aap ko feet kar paa rahi hum
 As far as the fourth assembly started from 1993 to 2008, the bjp's situation seems worse than the Congress
 varsh 1993 main bijepi jeet kar satta main ai or unki ek netaa poornima sethi vidhansabha main pahunchi, uske baad varsh 1998 se abhi tak yani 15 saalon main teen assembly main bijepi vipaksh main baithi or unki ek bhi mahila netaa vipaksh main nahin thi
 Meaning none of his women reached the assembly
 bijepi ke netaa dow
 Harshvardhan believes this and also clarifies that this happens due to many reasons, although the party is promoting women at all levels
 raajnneeti main chand mahilaon kii hi 'dhamak'desh kii raajnneeti main chand mahila netaa jaise kii sonia gandhi, mamata banerjee, shila dikshit, jayalalita chamak to bahut rahi hai, lekin ye raajnneeti kii asli tasviir nahin hai, har party aaj bhi mahilaon ko zyada se zyada tikat dene kii baat karti he
 But when elections are in front, the difference between his words and his actions is clearly known
 congress netaa digvijay singh ne kaha he ki ab vakt aa gaya he, jab rahul gandhi ko congress kii kaman sambhaal lenaa chahie
 In an interview to the English newspaper Economic Times, Digvijay Singh has said that Sonia Gandhi should now take the role of a guide and Rahul Gandhi should become the Congress President
 digvijay ne kaha, congress party ne hameshaa yuva logon ko mauka diya he, isliye main kah rahaa hum ki rahul gandhi ko ab congress kaa puraa charge lenaa chahie or sonia ji kii leadership to rahegi hi
 
 
 According to Digvijay, Rahul Gandhi will have to reach out to as many people as possible and for this he should go on a trip to India
 vahiin digvijay singh ke is bayaan par congress netaa maakhan laal photedaar ne palatwaar kiya he
 Fotedar has said that Digvijay himself wants to become a big leader, hence giving such statements

 After Pai, Adela and Duany, one paisa, two paisa, five paisa, ten paisa and 20 paise, now Chavanni also entered history from today
 chavanni dhaatu kaa ek sikaa maatr nahin thi balki hamaare itihaas kaa ek aisa gavaah bhi thi jisane vakt ke na jane kitne utaar chadhaav dekhe
 In 1919, 1920 and 1921, special Chavanni was made during the time of George V

 This chawni was made of nickel metal but this particular shape did not attract people
 itihaaskaaron kii maane to yah pehali aisi chavanni thi jiskaa aakaar gol nahin tha
 Historians say that machine-made Chavanni first came into circulation in 1835
 use east india company ke wiliam chaturth ke naam par jari kiya gaya tha
 Then it used to be silver
 puraane sikkon ke sangrah kaa shauk rakhane vaale 67 varshiya bujurg shribhagwan ne bataaya ki 1940 tak aayi chavanniyaan puri tarah chaandi kii raheen lekin iske baad milawat kaa daur shuru hua or 1942 se 1945 ke bich aadhi chaandi kii chavanni bazaar main utaari gayi

 Significantly, the coin was born in India during the fifth century BC
 darasal isse pehle vyapaar ke liye koi mudra astitv main nahin thi
 People used to take other goods instead of one goods, that is, barter system
 ise barter system bhi kaha jaataa tha
 But in view of the difficulties in barter, the need of currency was felt, which could be bought or sold at a fixed price
 is tarah mudra ke rup main sikaa astitv main aayaa
 History shows that the credit for introducing the modern currency i
e
 rupee goes to Sher Shah Suri
 shershah ne 11
 a 4 gram silver coin was introduced which was also known as silver rupee

 Reserve Bank sources said that as on 31 March 2010, there were a total of 54 billion 73
8 million coins in circulation in the market worth less than fifty paise, with a total value of Rs
 1,455 crore
 yah bazaar main prachlit kul sikkon kaa 54 fisad tak he
 However, due to the rising rate of inflation, 25 paise coin is already closed in circulation in the market and usually shopkeepers or customers do not use it in transactions
 jaankaar sutron ke anusaar 25 paise ke sikke ke dhaatu mulya kii laagat zyada padati he
 In the language of economics, it is said to be negative of coinage
 shuruyaat main iskaa mulya uski laagat se adhik hota tha
 This difference between the metal and the face value is the advantage of the government, but it becomes disadvantageous due to the lower the price and the higher the metal price
 ullekhneey he ki sikke banane main mukhya rup se tamba, nikal, jasta or stanlas steel kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Due to the rise in the prices of these major metals in the global market, most of the countries are clipping to make low value coins

 jhooth na bolen-navaratri ke dauraan log aksar jhooth bolne se parhez karte hai
 But the mother always maintains grace on her devotees who hold true to not only Navratri but also the rest of the day
 iske alaava agar aap apane kisi mitra se jhooth bolte hai or yah baat use baad main pataa chal jaati he to uskaa aapke upar se bharosa uth jayega
 Do not hurt the heart - In Hinduism it is said that such a pilgrimage and fast that has been done by someone's heart
 to is navaratri sankalp len ki aap kabhi bhi kisi kaa dil nahin dukhaayenge
 Do not cheat - Mother always maintains her grace on a genuine and clean person of heart
 dhokheybaaj vyakti par na to log bharosa karte hai or na hi un par koi devi krupa hoti he
 Respect for women - If you want to receive the grace of Goddess, then always respect women
 unki choti-choti baton par kamiyaan nikaalane kii jagah pyaar se har cheez kaa hal nikaalen
 Don't make more or less salt in food, talk about wearing clothes or watching TV
 burjugon kaa sammaan-kaha jaataa he ki jahaan bhagwaan nahin hote vahaan aapke saath aapke bade burjugon kaa ashish aapke saath rahata he

 3
 Men are not able to wait much, if there is a committed relationship, then do not keep your partner away from the bed for more days
 isse unamem khud ko lekar shaq hone lagata he
 Now it is not even that time that you cannot start by yourself
 
 
 isliye khul kar 'khelen'4
 Men also have their own figure, chintanata, fat, belly protruding, takla
 
 
 in sab ko lekar mard bhi kaaphi chintit rahete hai
 In such a situation, you can say in those 'special moments' in his ear that he is your prince and charming enough to set your body on fire

 The Minister of State for Mining presented this report in Parliament within the stipulated time frame and the Mining Secretary had to bear the brunt of it
 sawaal ye uth rahe hai ki khanan sachiv ko sazaa kyon mili
 Is it because this report exposes the Rs 35,000 crore scam that happened during the Congress rule? Trivedi, a victim of the government's anger, Vishwapati Trivedi, a 1977 batch IAS officer and mining secretary, became the victim of the government
 gussa is baat ko lekar ki khanan rajya mantri ne goa main hue khanan ghotaale par justise em bi shah kamishan kii report 7 sitambar ko sidhe sansad main pesh kar di
 As soon as the report was presented, Joint Secretary Alok Chaturvedi sent a show cause notice to Vishwapati Trivedi on 14 September in the Cabinet Secretariat
 notice main vishwapati trivedi se poocha gaya ki ye report sidhe sansad tak kaise pahunchi
 According to the notice, the report should be presented in Parliament through the cabinet
 aisa kyon nahin kiya gaya? khanan sachiv is notice kaa jawaab dete isse pehle unako baahar rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 According to the rules, the report of any commission of inquiry should be presented in Parliament through the cabinet within 6 months

 On the very next day of the Lalit modi-sushma Swaraj controversy, when the opposition parties accused Lalit Modi and Prime Minister Modi of the relationship between the two by citing photographs, the BJP overturned and accused the Congress of political bankruptcy

 Meanwhile, Lalit Modi disputed Shashi Tharoor and Sunanda Puskar

 ab pant kii ballebaaji kii chamak ke chaundh ke aage apekshaakrit dhili wicket keeping kii baat dab gai he
 He is also being compared to Adam Gilchrist because the batting patterns of both are almost the same, both play aggressive and vigorous shots and both are spectacular 
 philhal, pant ne isisi test rekking main 673 ank hasil karke bhartiya wicketiper ballebaajon main sabase adhik ranking ank hasil karne kaa record apane naam kar liya he
 Before him, Dhoni himself was on this chair who got 662 marks
 australia ko uske ghar main ghuskar parajeet karne kaa itihaas rachane vaali bhartiya team ke khilaadiyon ko unke pradarshan kaa phayda isisi test ranking main bhi mila he
 And Pant has now reached the 17th position in the ICC Test rankings
 daure kii shuruyaat se pehle pant test ranking main 59wein paaydaan par the
 Match by match benefited in his ranking and he reached the 17th position and equaled Farooq Engineer
 pant se pehle ejeeniyar ne janvari, 1973 main 17veen ranking hasil kii thi
 Although Dhoni was a brilliant finisher, his real flair was seen in odis
 dhoni kabhi bhi test rekking main 17wein paaydaan tak nahin pahunch paae the
 In the peak days of his career, Dhoni had attained the highest 19th ranking
 vaise australia daure se pehle pant ne mahaj 5 test match hi khele the
 But after playing 4 matches in Hades, it seems that Pant will remain a long time
 australia daure main pant ne kul 350 ran banaae, ek pari main 159 banaakar naabad rahe or 20 kaich bhi lapke
 Pant is the first Indian wicket-keeper to score a Test century in Australia
 isse pehle farrukh ejeeniyar ne 1967 main edilate main apane sarvocch 89 ran thonke the
 Earlier in 2018, Pant did another such act
 vah pichley saal england kii dharti par shatak udaane vaale pehle bhartiya wicket keeper bhi bane the
 By the way, Pant is still a little behind with the highest score from an Indian wicket-keeper and Dhoni still holds this chair
 wicket-keeper ke taur par sabase lambii pari dhoni kii hi he
 His highest score was 224 while in second place is Budhi Kundaran who scored 192
 australia kii dharti par kisi bhi mehmaan wicket-keeper kaa bhi sarvocch score abi divilliars kaa he jinhone 2012-13 main vaaka main 169 ran banaae the
 Apparently, Pant is now number two
 vaise australia main saatven number par ballebaaji karne mehmaanon main bhi pant duusare number par aa gaye hai
 Before that

 Ranjitsinhji scored 175 runs in 1897 on the ground of SCG
 pant or rabindra jadeja ne saatven wicket ke liye 204 ran kii saajhedaari kii jo australia main kisi bhi wicket ke liye bani saajhedaari main sabase lambii he
 Earlier in the MCG in 1983-84, Greg Mathew and Graham Yallop shared a 185-run partnership against Pakistan
 bharat ke lihaaj se videshi dharti par yah saatve wicket ke liye duusari sabase badi saajhedaari he
 By the way, Pant is the first wicket-keeper to make two Test centuries at the age of 21, both of them out of Asia
 in uplabdhiyon ke bainks, pant ke shot chayan main abhi bhi thodi jaldbaaji kaa bhav dikhataa he
 In the Test match, though the score board is now calling them more stable, but the responsibility-laden innings still await them
 aakraamakata unki ballebaaji kaa mizaaj he
 But it will be successful on every wicket, it would not be right to say that
 vaise bhi jaldbaaji or aakraamakata main fark hota he, thik vahi jo gaiyr-jimmedaari or manzilen tay karne ke drudh sankalp main hota he

 diggaj vampanthi netaa somnath chatarji ne daawa kiya he ki makapa mahasachiv prakaash karaat parmaanu qaraar ke mudde par apamaanit mahasoos karne ke baad 2008 main sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi lekar pradhanmantri manmohan singh or samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko sabak sikhaanaa chaahate the
 Former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee has said that due to his 'effective' image and influence on the government with 62 mps, Karat, AB Bardhan of CPI and other leftist leaders felt that his decision for the government was like the last words Will happen
 somnath ne apni aatmakatha ‘keeping da pheth: memyrs of e parliament’ main loksabhaa adhyaksh ke rup main apane antim dinon kii khatas ko yaad kiya he, jiskaa vimochan pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne shanivaar ko kiya
 Somnath wrote, "slowly for everyone, especially the people of the government after the UPA government was formed with Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi as President
 dhire yah spasht ho gaya ki vam dal ‘singhaasana ke peeche kii vaastavik shakti’ kii bhoomika nibhaana chaahate the
 The Left parties had 62 mps in the Lok Sabha and their support from outside depended on the existence of the government
 ’’ unhone likhaa he ki party ne is tarah kii dharna bana rakhi thi ki samprag sarkaar keval party ke netaaon, praathmik taur par iske mahasachiv prakaash karaat ke aashirwad se bani rah sakati he
 According to 81-year-old Somnath, the Congress' persistence in signing the nuclear deal angered Karat
 unhone kitaab ke ek adhyay ‘da eksplshan
 a Great Shock reads, "it seemed that Karat had decided that the Prime Minister and the UPA Chairperson had to teach a lesson for the insult they had committed
" ’purv loksabhaa adhyaksh ko makapa se 2008 main nishkasit kar diya gaya tha, jo das baar loksabhaa sadsy rah chuke hai
 He has written that he had no role in the Left parties' decision to withdraw support from the government
 harperkalins dwaara prakashit pustak ke mutabik, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki pradhanmantri or samprag adhyaksh kii taraf se jise karaat kaa apmaan samajha ja rahaa tha, usase vah itnaa vyathit ho gayi ki unhone sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene ke faisle ke nateezon ke bare main nahin sochaa yaa soch nahin sake
 Somnath said that it was his proposal that the CPI-M should take steps to find out the public opinion against the nuclear deal, although his idea was to keep opposing the agreement by the party
 loksabhaa (2004-09) ke itihaas ke sabase uhapoh vaale ghatnakramon main se ek kaa dilachasp vakya bataate hue somnath ne bataaya he ki centre se makapa ke samarthan vaapasi ke baad bhi unhone loksabhaa adhyaksh ke pad se istipha kyon nahin diya
 He has also referred to the confidence vote that followed in which he presided over the House and what attitude the party took with him
 somnath ke anusaar marxvaadi diggaj netaa jyoti basu ne unhen spikar ke taur par vishwaas mat main sadan kii adhyakshata karne kii salaah di thi
 He wrote, "I have learned a lot in my political career from Jyoti Basu, who was my undisputed leader till his last days
 main 12 july 2008 ko kolkata main unase mila or unhen party kii taraf diya gaya sandesh dikhaaya
 "according to Somnath," apparently he knew the party's position on the agreement and i did not discuss the issue with him
 lekin unhone mujhe salaah di ki mujhe vishwaas mat par sadan kii kaarywahi kii adhyakshata kerani chahie
 "he wrote," he thought, and i also thought that my resignation would make me feel like i am compromising my position as speaker and letting my party dominate my style of functioning which is totally Was immoral
 ’’ somnath ne yah bhi kaha he ki unhen apane khilaaf party kii taraf se anushaasanamak karrwai kaa purvabhaas tha lekin aisa kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki itani jaldbaaji main yah sab kiya jayega
 In his book, the former Lok Sabha speaker has also commented on other issues including the Babri Masjid demolition, NDA coming to power, Gujarat riots, Kandahar plane hijacking and Tehelka revelations
 unhone likhaa he ki chah disambar 1992 ko babari masjid kaa vidhwans dharmanirpekshata ke hamaare siddhant par milakar kiya gaya sabase bada hamalaa tha
