 When the anti-terrorism court or ATC granted bail to Lakhvi in adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on December 18, his exit was almost fixed, but after the attack on the school children in Peshawar, Pakistan's weeping shoulder to shoulder When India described Lakhvi's release as a big shock, Pakistan looked awake
 ek din pehle hi pakistan ne aatankwaadiyon ke saath sakhti baratane kaa sankalp liya tha
 In the case of terrorists, it was decided to reinstate the death penalty
 aise main mumbai main 166 hatyaon ke mastermind ke jail se baahar aane se pakistan kii antarrashtriya str par fajihat ho sakati thi
 This is the reason that before his release, he was again taken into custody under the Maintenance of Public Order
 lakhvi islamabad hoicourt pahunch gaya or hoicourt ne empio ko gaiyr-vaazib qaraar dekar 10 lakh rupee ke muchalke par lakhvi ko reeha karne kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 This was another defeat of the government of Pakistan in front of a terrorist
 koi rasta na dekhakar lakhvi ke khilaaf apharan ke ek chah saal puraane maamle ke bhuktabhogi ko saamne laayaa gaya
 Lakhvi's two-day police remand was obtained from the court as part of the case filed in this case
 guuruuvaar ko police paanch din kaa or remand chaahati thi, lekin court ne lakhvi ko 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya
 Lakhvi's lawyer Rizwan Abbasi alleged that the case was registered under pressure from India
 yah uske muvakkil ke adhikaron kaa hanan he
 The court has not yet accepted this argument, but the question is how long Lakhvi can be kept in jail in the kidnapping case
 lakhvi upree adaalat main jayega
 Meanwhile, the government of Pakistan has gone to the Supreme Court
 usne hoicourt ke us faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar kii he, jisamen lakhvi par empio hataane kaa aadesh diya gaya
 It is argued that the government's plea was not heard in the High Court
 pakistan ke sutara bataate hai ki asal main abhiyojan paksh haazir hi nahin hua tha
 There is a long chain of sobriety in the Lakhvi case from the Government of Pakistan
 isamen court main lakhvi ke khilaaf sabooton ko sahi dhang se nahin rakhana shaamil he
 Even with the witnesses presented against Lakhvi, she was unable to keep pace with him
 iskaa sabase bada namoona he okara ke skool ke headmaster mudassar lakhvi kii gavaahi
 Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only terrorist caught alive during the Mumbai attack, used to study in this school
 mudassar ne court main kah diya ki kasaab to zindaa he
 The investigating agency did not try its best to assure the court that the real Kasab was the one who was involved in the Mumbai attack and was hanged in India in 2012
 jabaki kasaab ke ikbaalia bayaan ko adaalat main bataur saboot on ricard le liya gaya tha or usee aadhaar par lakhvi kii 2009 main giraftaar bhi hui thi
 The chain of sobriety from Pakistan has not stopped here
 18 disambar ko lakhvi ko zamaanat dene ke faisle kii copy wo adaalat se 22 disambar tak hasil nahin kar pai, jo upree adaalat main is faisle ke khilaaf apil kaa aadhaar banati
 FIA lawyer Chaudhary Azhar weeps that all this has been ruled
 order kii copy nahin di gai, lekin kya vahaan aatankwaadi tangimen nyaayik vyavastha chalaati hai ki wo sarkari agency ko faisle kii copy lene se roak de? jawaab he nahin
 Then why did the judge not provide a copy of the order to the prosecution, while he reached the jailer for release
 kya jaj kisi dabaav main kaam kar rahe hai? lakhvi kii zamaanat yachika pehle kai mauqon par kaarij ho chuki thi, lekin is baar ground mudassar lakhvi ke bayaan, mukademe ke lanbaa khinchne or galat dharaaen lagane ko banaaya gaya
 By the way, there is also an interesting fact that Syed Qaurus Abbas Zaidi, an anti-terrorism court judge, is a Shia and is not given any protection
 iske pehle kai jaj or abhiyojan paksh ke vakil lakhvi maamle se kinaaraa kar chuke hai, kyonki unako dhamkiyaan milin thim
 The judge of Islamabad High Court nasir-ul-mulk, who revoked the MPO on Lakhvi, also has no protection
 ye tasviir kaa vah pahalu he, jo kisi maamle se jude faisle main dar, dabaav, dhamkee kii ashanka ko rekhaankit karata he, lekin asal baat gum phir kar vahiin aa jaati he
 Pakistan did not show seriousness against Lakhvi
 dikhaai hoti to use zamaanat nahin milti
 The legal battle that the government of Pakistan is fighting now seems to be an exercise to save its face
 jaise lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa mukhiya or mumbai hamale kaa sabase bada mastermind haafiz said lahore hoicourt se sabooton kii kami ke aadhaar par reeha ho gaya or ab azaad jivan ji rahaa he, lakhvi kaa maamla bhi kuch usee disha main jaataa prathit ho rahaa he
 Pakistan is just showing a little bit of sight
 asal main lakhvi jaison ko vahaan aatankwaadi mana hi nahin jaataa
 The government also fears that if it takes strict action against organizations like Jamat-ud Dawa or terrorists associated with it, then the whole Punjab will get burnt, because this province is the stronghold of these Tanjim
 or ye suba hi nawaz shareef ko satta tak pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Lastly, if we also believe that the government of Nawaz Sharif is serious about Lakhvi's case and wants to give the result, should it be believed that the decisions in favor of Lakhvi are coming so that the elected government of Pakistan is upset? But to believe this would mean to question the justice system of Pakistan, to accuse him of acting under the influence of the army, which we do not want to do
 mukhyamantri mayawati ne kaha ki pradesh kii takadir or tasviir badalane kaa daawa karne vaali congress or uske yuvaraj ko yah nahin bhoolanaa chaiye ki pradesh main 40 varsh congress kaa hi shashan rahaa or isi dauraan sabase zyada garib evam berozegaar anya rajyon main gayi

 He said that all the opposition parties of BJP, SP and BJP in the state have been trying to tarnish the image of the government and the party from time to time
 , While these parties do not have the right to accuse
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke aarope lagane vaali congress ke netritv vaali upie kii 31 maah puraani kendra sarkaar ke kaarykaal main 82 ghotaale abhi tak saamne aa chuke he

 The story of the film, the acting of all the actors including Kangana Ranot, the spontaneous comedy and endings arising out of the situation, all have meaning
 aapako ye film jarur jarur dekhni chahie

 a Khidmat is my soul for him
 film queen bahut nishpaap he
 Its lead character, which is called Heroine in Bombay language
 vah kahin se bhi heroin nahin lagati
 There seems to be a middle class girl around us, who grows up in the shadows of all the men like Papa, Bhaiya and sons, if we can say it increases
 vah tamaam duniyaadaari sikhti he, magar is kram main usamen tanik bhi kalush nahin aata
 The other characters also seem to reconcile the opposites
 film kisi ko bhi thahar kar jaj nahin karti
 Neither the judgment of right or wrong nor in the traditional way finally the freedom of the woman is full of noise, boisterous speech with words rubbing on your mind
 isaki or paraten kholane se pehle kahani ke kuch sire goonth len
 Will be easy rani dilli ke rajori garden kii he
 Papa is sweet and in the words of his friend, Rani Bitiya is very sweet
 bilkul chaashni main pagi
 But the truth is that in the words of the queen herself, the queen continued to accept all her life
 acchhee bani rahi
 And in this sequence, as it happens most of the time, could not contain her confidence to ever cross this handful of sky, which is called the world
 rani ko vijay se pyaar ho jaataa he
 For this, Vijay does all the hard work that our generation has learned
 kabhi dil vaale balun le janaa, to kabhi peechha kar apane pyaar kii gaharaai kaa jabaran ehsaas karana
 Then comes the turn of Queen Weds Victory Moment
 magar vijay babu to ab euke ho aae hai
 Morden has reportedly taken place
 to unhen ab rani apane tip kii nahin lagati
 And they decide not to speak two days before marriage
 rani par to jaise pahaad gir jaataa he
 But when the tears of silence dry up in the morning, she first eats the packed laddus for her wedding and then decides that she will keep the pie she plans to honeymoon in Paris and Amsterdam by adding pie
 nihaayat paak or kathith samajhadaari se rahit rani ko uske mummy papa bhi jane dete hai
 Perhaps this will give some repair to the dilapidated heart of the daughter, thinking that
 rani jab paris pahunchati he, to shuruaati jhatkon ke baad khud ko us duniya ke hawaale kar detii he, jahaan hansane muskuraane ke liye kisi tech kisi sahare kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Here she meets half Indian girl Vijayalakshmi
 vijayalakshmi ek hotel main kaam karti he, masti karti he or puri talleenta ke saath apane boyfriend se hue bete ko paalati he
 The queen opens, blossoms and blossoms with him
 yahaan jab rani safar ke duusare padaav amsterdam kii taraf ravaanaa hoti he, to vijay ko uske is nae rup ke dhokhe se darshan ho jate hai
 Then they think Aayla, what have i done
 vah devdas mod main aa jate hai or apni queen ko paane ke liye nikal padate hai, main tere peeche peeche aauungaa kaa raag alaapte hue us shahar kii taraf
 But the queen is learning new and important meaning of life here with her new friends
 to kya rani waapas rajouri aakar vijay ko gale laga leti he
 
 
 It is here that the film delivers the message with great seriousness and simplicity
 is film ko apni bedaag acting se sanvaara he kangana ranot ne
 He told us why he needed to be taken very seriously
 bina mechap ke lajpat nagar market tip kurti or genes main pehle jhijak chalati or aakhir main daudti rani ek aurat kaa safar he or use tasallibaksh jindagi muhaiyaa karai he kangana ne
 Mummy Papa's swear, i became a fan of this girl's acting
 rani kii kahani kii shuruyaat hoti he, tipical dilli andaaj main
 The girl's mehndi is going on and she is worrying that Hi Mummy did not even change the suit
 chintu photo bhi nahin khinch rahaa, fasebuk par kaise apadet karuungi or vijay euke se lautakar kitna smart lagane laga he
 All these things bind us in the hypnosis of this character
 phir jab vah paris main sharaab pine ke baad apni muskaan or aansu ke bich tamaam dar or soch saajha karti he, to aap uske pyaar main pad jate hai
 At last, when she runs on the footpath of the city on her own wearing a frocknuma dress, it is clear that her real dreams are finally realized
 film main rani ke alaava vijay ke role main rajkumaar raav ne bhi bahut umdaa acting kii he or shahid se shuru kii ravaayat ko aage badhaayaa he
 How an Indian child transforms his love into dominion, dominates the name of Care and when it comes to the point of losing everything, how to get into chirouri mode, it is best shown in the Queen
 iske alaava lija heden or duusare actors ne bhi apane apane role bakhubi nibhaae hai
 i mentioned above that there is a harmony of opposites in the film
 ek taraf rani kii daadi he, jo use samajhaati he ki betaa jab hamen lagata he ki sab khatm ho gaya, tab ham galat hote hai
 Then when life gets better, then it is understood that what happened is good
 kul milakar dilli main rahane ke baavjood khub child out daadi
 And there is a family of Dhingra Uncle living in Paris, whose women read such Marcia on seeing the queen, Goya Rani's marriage did not break down, the fight of life was shattered forever
 ek taraf vijay kii mummy hai, jinke liye paris se lauti rani ek khulaa khat he, jiskaa majamoon bas itnaa he ki jab betaa or papa daftar chale jaaenge, to vah chaay piengi saath main
 Gossip will fight and kitty will do
 duusari taraf vijayalakshmi he, jo kisi bhi gilt ko pare dhakel apane tain jindagi jeene main lagi he
 When the queen does the burden of her virginity lip-to-lip kiss, she is also seen to have immersed all the guilt in an open manner
 isi tarah se vah jab ant main vijay ko gale lagaati he, to usamen kisi bhi kism kii badale kii bhaavana nahin hoti
 This is a kind of sage gesture, in which even after knowing everything, the holy stubbornness of remaining inferior dominates
 diarector vikaas bahal ne kahani kii kasaavat main kahin bhi kami nahin chodi
 Looking at the length of the film, it seems at once that somewhere the plot must have been forcibly spread across many heads
 magar aisa hota nahin
 Speed and rotation are constant
 haa kuch ek videshi kirdaaron kii kahani sunaakar rani ke dukh or ubaar ko jo sandarbh muhaiyaa karaane kii koshish kii gai he, usase bachaa ja saktaa tha
 Amit Trivedi's music is constantly reminiscent of Dev D
 rani ke viyog ke dauraan baja ranjha ho yaa aakhir main uske ubhaar ke dauraan baja 'kinare mil gaye', sab kahani kii saghanta ko badhaane main madadgaar sabit hote hai
 Do watch the movie 'queen'
 ye bataati he ki maine hothon se lagaai to hangaamaa ho gaya gane vaali aurat jaruri nahin ki aazaadee ke naam par aatmghaat ke raste kii taraf hi bade
 This film will help make you a better person

 BCCI President Shashank Manohar lashed out at Lalit Modi, accusing him of tarnishing the image of the cricket board and also making misleading allegations that IPL interim president Chirayu Amin was part of the failed bid by the Pune franchise
 manohar ne kaha ki yah sachai he ki nilambit ipel ayukta ne pune samooh ko salaah di thi ki vah niveshak ke rup main amin ko shaamil karen or ipel antarim adhyaksh paisa lagane ke liye maan gayi the basharte kii yah boli safal rahati or unhone iske liye board kii anumati bhi maangi thi
 Manohar also claimed, contrary to Modi's allegations, that the IPL Governing Council did not know that Anirudh Deshpande, the managing director of City Corporation, personally bid
 unhone kaha ‘sachai yah he ki khud modi ne ajay shikare ke jariye pune frenchiji ko sandesh bheja tha ki ve amin se sampark karen or unhen samooh kaa hissaa banane ke liye kahen
 Manohar said that when the bidders met Amin to join the group, Amin agreed to invest ten percent in the event of winning the bid and got the bcci's permission
 amin ne mujhe patr diya or uski ek kapi maanad sachiv (en shrinivasana) ko di jisame kaha gaya tha ki pune frenchiji ke log usase mili the

 The bid on the Pune franchise was won by the Sahara Group, but the bid sparked huge controversy as it was said to include former BCCI chief and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar and his MP daughter Supriya Sule

 But Manohar said that the IPL Governing Council knew that Deshpande was bidding alone, but the bid was rejected outright
 manohar ne kaha, ‘modi ne ek bayaan diya tha ki deshpandey ne unhen suchit kar diya tha ki boli bhale hi city karporation limited kii taraf se lagaayi jaayegi, lekin sachmuch main yah unki vyaktigat boli thi
 'manohar said,' Modi himself is caught in controversies and he is repeatedly trying to tarnish the image of the board by making such wrong and baseless statements, while the board has come to such a shameful position because of his wrongdoings

 Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia is now under attack from the opposition for the huge staff in his office
 ek artiai main khulaasa hua he ki dipti siem ke aphis main 63 logon kaa staff he, ab isi ko lekar vipaksh ne aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ko gherna shuru kar diya he
 When the Aam Aadmi Party formed the government in Delhi, claiming simplicity and economy, the opposition started targeting Kejriwal and his party over misuse of power
 ab aadhaar ek artiai kaa jawaab bana he, jo dilli sarkaar kii taraf se diya gaya he
 In this reply a list of staff working with the Deputy CM of Delhi is given
 is suchi ke mutabik sisodiya ke paas 7 oesady yani afisar on special duty he or teen nijee sachiv hai, iske alaava hedclerk, adwiser, media stoff ke alaava 18 chaparasi hai
 According to RTI activist and BJP leader Vivek Garg, through this huge staff, the Deputy CM has worked to benefit those close to him
 kyonki isamen se zyaadaatar kotrminus aadhaar par niyukt kiye gaye hai or bina kisi yogyata ke niyukti di gai he
 However, AAP leader Dilip Pandey has termed Vivek Garg's claims as baseless and his RTI documents as fake
 isi aadhaar par unhone is par koi pratikriya bhi nahin di, lekin vipaksh is mudde par kejariwal sarkaar ko chhodane ke mood main nahin he
 According to Manoj Tiwari, President of BJP, Manoj Tiwari, the matter should be investigated as to why a minister or deputy CM needs so much staff
 unhone kaha ki bade-bade sansthaanon main kisi ke paas itnaa staff nahin hota or ye apni nijee staff main itane log rakhte he
 Tiwari termed it a waste of public money and said that the real reason behind it should be revealed
 gauratlab he ki ravivaar ko hi dipti siem manish sitaudiya ne is baat kii ashanka jataai thi ki notebandi ke vajah se dilli sarkaar kaa tex collection prabhavit hua he or is baar karmchaariyon ko selary dene ke liye bhi fund kii kami ho sakati he
 In such a situation, after the RTI, the Delhi government is once again caught up in controversies regarding extravagance

 On 25 December, the inauguration program of the new line has been kept in Noida where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are arriving

 Time saving, 1 lakh people will travel every day, such is the new Magenta line of the metro, however the interesting thing is that Arvind Kejriwal, the head of the Aam Aadmi Party government, who has a 50 percent share in the metro, will not be seen at the inauguration of the Magenta Line
 dilli siem ko nimantran na milane kii jaanakri milte hi 'aap' netaa centre sarkaar par hamalavar ho gaye hai
 AAP leader Sanjay Singh says that due to political opposition, hatred has increased so much that the Prime Minister does not like to sit with an elected Chief Minister
 isse pehle jab faridabad se jab metro kaa udghaatan hua tha, tab bhi arvind kejariwal ko nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 On the other hand, Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj has gone a step ahead and placed a strange demand in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 saurabh kaa kahana he ki 'fez 3 main 46 hajaar karod kharch hue hai or usamen se centre sarkaar ne mahaz 460 karod kharch kiye hai
 Return 40 thousand crore rupees of all stakeholders to Prime Minister Modi and inaugurate himself
 piem modi ko phej 1 or phej 2 kaa kharch bhi lautaa den taaki puraane tamaam stesan kaa udghaatan bhi centre sarkaar khud kar sake'
 Saurabh Bhardwaj said, "protocol has been in operation for 70 years that when the Prime Minister comes, the Chief Minister is called on the stage, because the state governments fill the treasury of the Center
 metro ke andar anokhi sthiti he, centre or rajya sarkaar kii barabari ko hissedari he
 Despite this, at the inauguration, the Center did not call the elected Chief Minister to take full credit for himself and loot the public applause
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle jab oktober 2017 main metro kaa kiraaya badha tha tab kejariwal sarkaar or modi sarkaar ke bich kaaphi khinchataan dekhne mili thi
 Surprisingly though, the Delhi Metro, which once exemplified the partnership between the Center and the state, has also become a political weapon

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is known for his clean image
 apane kurte par wo ek daag, ek dhabba tak dekhnaa nahin chaahate, lekin usee nitish kumaar ko cabinet main ek daagi mantri ke saath baithna padaa
 This will be the first time in 12 years that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has got to see this day
 buudhvaar kii cabinet kii baithak main sabaki najar bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav par tiki hui thi ki sibiai ke exiaar main naam aane ke baad jis tareeke se janata dal you ne kaha ki wo tathyon ke aadhaar par pramanik saboot pesh karen
 Regardless of whether he comes in the cabinet or not
 barkhaast karne main der nahin lagaate siem nitishajediu kii baithak mennithish kumaar nespasht kaha tha ki wo bhrashtachar se samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 Nitish Kumar has a record for the last 12 years that when a minister's name came up in a case or charge sheet, it did not take any delay to remove him from his cabinet, but Tejashwi Yadav has been given time to deliberate and decide
 chunki yah exiaar sibiai ne kiya he, isliye is par zyada sawaal bhi nahin uthaaya ja saktaa kyonki sibiai jaanch ke baad hi exiaar darj karti he
 Tejashwi reached the meeting with Tej Pratap, but Tejashwi Yadav joined the cabinet meeting, although he arrived a few minutes before the start of the cabinet
 unke saath unke bade bhai or mantri tejpratap yadav bhi the
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached the secretariat 25 minutes ahead of schedule for the cabinet meeting

 jaldi khatm ho gai bihar cabinet kii baithkabaithak tay samay se thodi der main shuru hui or bahut jaldi khatm bhi ho gai
 Nitish Kumar's cabinet meeting usually lasts for 1 hour and sometimes more than 2 hours
 lekin ye baithak 25-30 minute main hi khatm ho gai
 The atmosphere of the cabinet was definitely changed
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke bagal main hi upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav kii kursi aaj bhi lagi thi, unke bagal main tejpratap yadav the
 Today both young ministers should be quite silent
 aamtaur par cabinet kii baithak main charchaa hoti he, lekin is baar aisa kuch nahin hua

 30 baje bulaai thi, haalanki ye baithak aamtaur ko mangalvaar ko hoti rahi he, lekin mangalvaar ko janata dal you ke santhnik baithak thi
 Perhaps because this meeting was called on Wednesday or Nitish Kumar would have called a cabinet meeting to know whether Tejashwi Yadav comes or not
 tejasvi ne pesh kii safayeetejasvi yadav aaye bhi or cabinet ke baad apni safai bhi pesh kii
 He said that he was being implicated, saying that he was 14-15 years old when the hotel was leased and at the time the land was acquired
 unhone kaha ki sibiai ne exiaar piemanarendra modior amit shah ke kehane par darj kii he
 CM Nitish did not break the silence In this case, Tejashwi Yadav came out when he got shares as a director of Delight Company and it was 2014
 baharhaal nitish kumaar ne aaj bhi apni chuppi nahin todi or wo cabinet kii baithak ke baad haath jod kar nikal gaye
 It is believed that Nitish Kumar has made up his mind and he can give a decision on this issue in a day or two

 bhartiya swatantraaa senaanee or rajaneta jaiprakash narayan ko desh ke purv pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru kii beti or purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke virodh ke liye janaa jaataa tha or kaha jaataa he ki unke andolan kii vajah se indira gandhi ke haath se satta tak chin gai thi
 The revolution against Indira Gandhi began during Indira Gandhi's rule, the country was struggling with the problem of not meeting many basic necessities ranging from inflation and people were upset with the government of Indira Gandhi lost in power
 us vakt jaiprakash narayan ne satta ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kaa faisla kiya or unhone indira gandhi ko patr likhaa or desh ke bigadate halaat ke bare main bataaya
 After that, he wrote a letter to other members of the country and described many of Indira Gandhi's decisions as a democratic threat
 lokapal kii thi maangajayprakash narayan ke is patr se raajnneetik jagat main hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya tha, kyonki pehali baar kisi ne indira gandhi ke khilaaf sidhe aawaaj uthaai thi
 At the same time, in his letter to mps, he had demanded to make Lokpal and appoint Lokayukta
 saath hi narayan ne bhashtrachaar ke khilaaf banaai gai cameti kii aawaaj dabaane kaa aarope bhi indira gandhi par lagaaya tha
 Beginning in Gujarat, Indira Gandhi demanded donations from the Congress governments of the states
 is dauraan gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri chiman bhai se bhi 10 lakh rupee kii maang kii thi or kosh badhaane ke liye kai chizon ke daam badha die gaye
 After which there were agitations in the state and many agitators were killed due to police brutality
 is dauraan 24 janvari 1974 mukhyamantri ke istife kii taarikh tay kar di gai
 But the movement was further fueled by the attitude of Chiman Bhai
 uske baad jaiprakash narayan ne andolan kaa samarthan kiya, jiske baad unhen gujarat bulaayaa gaya
 Before Jayaprakash Narayan went to Gujarat, he tried to hold power in his hands through the Governor and on 9 February 1974, two days before Jayaprakash Narayan came to Gujarat, he resigned Chimanbhai and imposed President's rule in the state
 uske baad morarji desai ne narayan ke saath dobaaraa chunaav karwaane kii maang kii
 At the same time, this movement also spread to other states like Bihar
 uske baad railway ke lakhon karmchaaree hadtaal par chale gaye, jisase indira gandhi ke saamne dikkat khadi hone lagi ki aakhir pehle kisase nipta jaae?bihar main andolan kaa prabhavabihar main bhi gujarat kii tarah chaatro ne andolan kiya or vidhansabha kii ore kooch kiya
 After that action was taken against the students, firing them, in which many students were killed and JP was demanded to command the movement
 haalanki jepi ne andolan kii kaman sanbhaalane se pehle kaha ki is andolan main koi bhi vyakti kisi bhi party se judaa hua nahin hona chahie
 After that people took all their demands and the students associated with political parties also decided to resign and go with JP
 isamen congress ke bhi kai chaatr shaamil the or sabhi chaatr bihar chaatr sangharsh samiti ke binar tale andolan main kud gaye
 After this, JP took command of the movement in his hand and demanded the resignation of Bihar Chief Minister Abdul Ghafoor
 jepi kii chetavaneeus dauraan jepi ne ki unki bhashtrachaar kalabazari aadi ke khilaaf ladaai jari he or unhone andolan ko jari rakhane kii baat kahi
 After that Indira Gandhi said on the basis of Jayaprakash Narayan that some people are trying to get into active politics by losing their interest in village development
 uske baad isse congressiyon samet kai log iskaa virodh karne lage
 After that, the movement grew with Indira's anti-jayaprakash statements and Jayaprakash Narayan made the movement sharper
 uske baad jaiprakash narayan ne sarkaar ko hataane ko lekar andolan tej kar diya
 This movement rocked the power On 8 April 1974, Jayaprakash Narayan took out a procession to protest, in which the angry public took part against the power
 isamen hajaaron hi nahin lakhon logon ne bhaag liya or khud jaiprakash narayan ne isaki aguwai kii thi
 This movement of Jayaprakash Narayan led to the slipping of power from under Indira Gandhi and later Indira Gandhi faced so much opposition that there was not much time left in her hands
 jaiprakash narayan ne aazaadee ke baad hi nahin, usase pehle bhi gandhi ke saath bharat chodo jaise andolanon ko safal banaaya tha

 Once again a situation of confrontation has arisen between the Delhi Government and the Central Government
 dilli sarkaar ne kendriya grahamantri ko patr likhakar ek aadesh maanane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 An order in this regard was given to the Delhi government after the Center canceled the suspension of two Danics officers by the state government
 centre kii chitthee kii jawaab main dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne grahamantri rajnath singh ko ek chitthee likhakar kaha he ki centre sarkaar ke is aadesh ko maanane se rajya ke sabhi adhikariyon ko galat sandesh jayega
 Sisodia said that the Home Ministry sent only one letter, there is no Presidential order
 upmukhyamantri kaa tark he ki grih mantralay kii baat maanane kaa matlab he dilli sarkaar ke adhikaar main badi katautee jisase afasaron main anushaasanheenata aegi or sarkaar ke hone yaa naa hone kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 It is noteworthy that the Delhi government had ordered two of its officials to sign a cabinet pass resolution, which both the officials refused to do
 donon adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki jab tak is prastaav par niyamanusaar alji se sweekruti nahin mil jaati tab tak ve hastakshar nahin karenge
 The government suspended both officials after both refused to accept the Delhi government's signing order

 The Sangh said that the suspension is illegal and the Center should declare it illegal
 sisodiya ne apni chitthee main adhikariyon ke nilamban kii paristhitiyon kaa zikr kiya he
 He said that the Delhi High Court, in an order, ordered the Delhi government to decide on the increase in the salary of the public prosecutor at the earliest
 unhone bataaya ki is sambandh alji se do baar baat hui lekin unhone (alji) ek baar bhi public prosicuter ke vetan vruddhi kaa virodh nahin kiya
 Both times he questioned the right of the Delhi Cabinet to take such decisions
 yah sawaal adaalat main lambit ek maamle ko lekar uthaaya gaya tha
 The comments sisodiya ne likhaa ki tronjection of bijness rule 14(2) kahata he ki jab koi prastaav cabinet paarit karti he or use alji ko suchit kar diya jaataa he tab sambandhit vibhaag kaa mantri us nirnay ke karyanvayan ke liye uchit kadam uthaa saktaa he
 Under this rule, the Home Minister of the Delhi government had asked the two special secretaries to issue orders in relation to the decision of the cabinet
 donon hi sachivon ne aadesh maanane se inkaar kar diya or grahamantri ke paas unke nilamban karne ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin tha
 Sisodia also wrote in his letter that in this case it took the Home Ministry only one day to revoke the order of the Delhi government while it took 15 days to order the suspension of the red-handed officer

 donon ke dilli sarkaar ke hastakshar karne ke aadesh ko maanane se inkaar karne ke baad sarkaar ne donon adhikariyon ko nilambit kar diya tha
 Both these officers belonged to the Danics cadre and in protest against this suspension, the officers' union held a meeting and demanded the central government to repeal the suspension

 unhone donon hi baar dilli cabinet ke aise nirnay lene ke adhikaar par sawaal uthaaya
