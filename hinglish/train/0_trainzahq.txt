 Rating: 2 Stardirector: Abhishek Chaubekaalakar: Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Diljit Dosanjh There was a row of controversies about 'udta Punjab' and there was a ruckus before the film was released, and then the film Kasensprit was leaked online, it was in Indian cinema
 Is a very sad chapter of kisi bhi film yaa rachanaatmak kaam ko lekar is tarah ke maahaul ko acha nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Talking about the film, this film, showing the real situation of Punjab, turned out to be average due to weak script and treatment
 film ko dekhakar bich-bich main aisa ehsaas hua ki is vishay ko lekar diarector abhishek choube ko thodi or mehnat kerani chahie thi
 He has tried to present the seriousness of the entire subject very lightly, he may have done this to lighten the atmosphere of the film, but this thing is piercing
 anuraag kashyap ne film kaa vishay sahi chunaa he lekin vah uski gaharaai main utar nahin paae, or unka dhyaan punjab main failte nashe ke karabor se zyada vahaan log kis tarah gaaliyaan dete hai yaa pop star nasha karata he, is par zyada focus ho gaya
 Then at the beginning of the film, the legal things are written, they are copied from the style of Star Wars movie, and this is very touching
 mjedaar yah ki hindi film main angreji samachar sunate gaanv ke bande pehali baar najar aae hai
 There is a lack of depth in the film about the drug trade in Punjab
 acting main dilajit dosanjh thik hai
 Shahid Kapoorpuri does not understand what he is doing in the film and this is another big blow for his career
 karina kapur khan ne yah role kyon chunaa vah hi achche se jaanati hongi
 The one that attracted the most attention in the film is Alia Bhatt
 film relies hone se pehle unka ek bihari majdoor ke taur par najar aane ko lekar kai tarah ke sanshay man main the
 But he won hearts with his brilliant acting
 unki dialog delivery or kairactor donon hi jaandaar the
 If Anurag had woven the film around his character, then perhaps the film would have been different
 aaliyake kairactor ko lekar hameshaa yah laga rahata he ki uske saath kya ho rahaa hoga
 If the film had been kept a bit tight then perhaps the film would have been sharp
 tommy singh ke kairactor or dilajit kii jindagi ko thodaa chhaant diya janaa chahie tha
 Since the film was leaked before its release, the weak story could prove to be another major setback for the film
 shaayad anuraag ko vivaadon se zyada apni filmon kii kahani par dhyaan dena hoga

 In Jammu and Kashmir, the terrorists have once again targeted the Jammu and Kashmir Police

 Javed Ahmed Dar's mother was going to go for Haj, for which he was going to take medicines
 jis dauraan aatankiyon ne unke agava kiya
 Understand here how the terrorists demonstrated their cowardice and brutally killed the police jawan

 darasal, andolan kii jo parampara eukedy ne shuru kii, rajya ke gathan ke baad vah use kaayam nahin rakh paaya
 While the party had to focus on issues like water, forest, land, employment, migration and industrialization in the mountains, the party shifted from this to the Ganesh Parikrama of the government
 rajya gathan ke baad 2002 main bani congress sarkaar ko to kisi samarthan kii jarurat nahin thi, par 2007 main jaise hi bhaajapa ne eukedy ko saath aane kaa nyauta diya, vah sarkaar main shaamil ho gaya
 But this decision proved to be a mistake by UKD
 haalanki eukedy ne bhaajapa sarkaar ko 9 muddon par aadhaarit samarthan diya tha, lekin bhaajapa in par eukedy ko paanch saal tak bahalaati rahi
 While the BJP has made Khanduri twice, Nishank as chief minister twice, during this period, nothing has happened to the issue-based agreement with the UKD
 yahaan tak ki pahaado main udyogikaran, palaayan rokane or gairsann rajdhani jaise jaruri muddon par bhi bhaajapa ne koi nirnay nahin kiya
 It happened so much that the BJP gave a post of cabinet minister in the government to the UKD and finally the minister of the UKD quota could not do any good to the people of the state, but the party got divided
 2002 main bhaajapa sarkaar ke gathan ke samay se hi eukedy main sangharshon se niklaa ek bada dhada yah maanata rahaa ki use bhaajapa ko koi samarthan nahin dena chahie
 But the other faction succeeded in persuading the party to support it by speaking of political stability in the state

 lekin party kaa ek dhada cabinet mantri divakar bhatta ke netritv main is faisle ke khilaaf ho gaya
 Diwakar did not agree and the other faction of the party withdrew support from the government
 sadan main eukedy ke teen vidhayak hai, jisamen se omgopal ravat bhi mantri ke saath hi sarkaar ke paale main chale gaye
 Only one MLA, Pushpesh Tripathi, came in the court of Pawar faction withdrawing support
 eukedy ne aupchaarik rup se 27 disambar, 2010 ko sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kaa elaan kiya tha
 Since then, this party has been divided into two factions

 verma ke sansad main bayaan par mulaayam kaaphi ukhd gaye the or unhone unki 'aukaat' kii baat tak kah daali thi or unhone mantrimandal se verma ko baahar nikaalane kii maang kii thi
 Union Minister Kamal Nath had also apologized on behalf of the government after Verma's statement on Mulayam
 or mangalvaar ko hui congress sansadeey dal kii baithak main benny prasad verma aae bhi nahin the
 It is worth noting that Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma recently made a lot of sarcasm on SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 apane ek bayaan main benny prasad verma ne mulaayam singh se apni jaan ko khatra tak bataa diya tha
 Mulayam was quite uprooted over Verma's statement in Parliament and even went as far as to talk about his 'aukat' and demanded that Verma be taken out of the cabinet
 mulaayam par die verma ke byan ke baad sarkaar kii ore se kendriya mantri kamalnath ne maafee bhi maang lee thi
 And Beni Prasad Verma did not even attend the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting on Tuesday
 verma ke sansad main bayaan par mulaayam kaaphi ukhd gaye the or unhone unki 'aukaat' kii baat tak kah daali thi or unhone mantrimandal se verma ko baahar nikaalane kii maang kii thi

 is baat se to sabhi cricket prashansak waakif hai ki ran banane ke lagbhag saare record apane naam karne waleschin tendulkarne pakistan ke khilaaf apanintararashtriya cricketkariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 But he was so scared that he was starting to doubt his ability to play at this level, when he stepped into Test cricket in 1989 against a Pakistani fast bowler adorned with dangerous fast bowlers like Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram
 haal hi main jari apni aatmakatha‘plaing it maay ve’main tendulkar ne khulaasa kiya ki unki pehali test pari unke liye kis kadar kathin gujri thi
 He wrote in his book, 'he was nothing short of an ordeal
 test cricket main apni pehali pari main main wasim or vakaar ke saamne tha or mujhe ballebaaji kii apni kshamta par shaq hone laga or mere bheetar yah sawaal uthne laga ki kya main kabhi antarrashtriya str par acha khel sakuunga
 He further wrote, 'my debut became even more special because we were playing against Pakistan in Pakistan and they had fast bowlers like Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Yunus, Aaqib Javed while Mushtaq Ahmed and Abdul Qadir
 As were the spinners
 ’ apane pehle daure ke bare main tendulkar ne bataaya ki kaise aakraamak wasim ne unka test cricket main istakabal kiya tha
 He said, 'I was on strike in front of him on the third ball of the over and he bowled that bouncer
 wasim kii gendbaaji ko samajhane ke kaaran mujhe pataa tha ki agali gend yarker hogi or main maansik rup se uske liye taiyaar tha
 Tendulkar wrote, Wasim then threw a bouncer which i gave up
 main yarker kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha, lekin paanchavin or chhathi gend bhi bounsar nikali
 At the end of that over, i told myself, welcome to Test cricket
 chir pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf antarrashtriya cricket ke dabaavon se waakif tendulkar ne bataaya ki sialkot main chauthe test main kaise vakaar kii gend par vah lahooluhaan ho gaye the
 He said, i made my first run when Waqar bowled a short ball which i thought would go to the chin
 main gend ke oochaal ko bhaanp nahin sakaa or vah chah inch adhik unchi uthi or mere helmet ke flap par ja lagi
 That ball hit my nose
 tendulkar ne kaha, mujhe kuch dikhaai nahin de rahaa tha or meraa sir baari ho gaya
 After that the ball went into slip and i started to see where the ball went
 usee samay maine apni kameez par khun dekha
 He said, i was trying to overcome the shock that Javed Miandad was surprised at the comments
 vah kah rahe the ‘are tuje to abhi aspataal janaa padegaa, tera naak tut gaya he
 It was written on a banner in the galleries, the children came home to drink milk, which further aggravated my discomfort
 tendulkar ne ek or vaakye kaa zikr kiya jab karachi test main 16 saal kaa yah ladkaa na sirf dar gaya tha balki bharat- pakistan match se jude jajbaat kaa bhi use ilm hua
 He said, my first day in international cricket was full of drama and one incident was very bad
 lunch ke baad salwar kameez pahane ek dadhi vaala vyakti maidan main ghus gaya or pakistan aane ke liye kapil dev ko apshabd kehane laga
 He said, after Kapil he went to Manoj Prabhakar in the midoff
 prabhakar ko apshabd kehane ke baad vah captain shrikant ke paas gaya or hathapayee karne laga
 He said, i was fielding at the point and i was afraid that the next number would be mine and i was ready to run towards the dressing room

 This question has been raised many times since the Mulayam and Akhilesh got involved before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 chunaav main bijepi ke haathon chaaron khaane chit hone ke baad is sawaal par kuch samay ke liye viraam lag gaya tha
 But now once again the movement within the Samajwadi Party has increased and it is being said that during Navratras, Mulayam Singh can announce a new party or a new front with his brother Shivpal Yadav
 do din pehle shivpal yadav ne kanujj main kaha tha ki mulaayam singh yadav kaa apmaan ab or bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, Shivpal Yadav has been sidelined in politics after this quarrel between the party and the family and in the Samajwadi Party he was looking for a way of returning the honor
 lekin sutron ke mutabik akhilesh yadav or unke samarthak kisi bhi tarah unpar bharosa karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 So now he wants to play Mulayam for a new challenge
 isse pehle samaajawaadee party main gatividhi bad gai he
 On Wednesday 20 September, Akhilesh Yadav, President of the Samajaparty, will hold a press conference in Lucknow
 21 taarikh ko mulaayam sihan yadav or shivpal yadav ne lohia trust kii baithak bulaai he
 Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav are also members in this trust
 ye log baithak main shaamil hote hai yaa nahin isapar sabaki nazren hogin
 Because this trust is dominated by people close to Mulayam
 akhilesh ke jo bhi log is trust main sadsy the un sabko shivpal yadav pehle hi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa chuke hai
 It is believed that Mulayam and Shivpal will also show the way out of the trust to the remaining people of Akhilesh
 lakhanu ke ramabai ambedkar maidan main 23 sitambar ko akhilesh yadav ne samaajawaadee party kaa pradeshik sammelan bulaayaa he or 5 oktober ko agra main samaajawaadee party kaa rashtriya adhiveshan bulaayaa gaya he
 Through these meetings, Akhilesh Yadav wants to consolidate his hold in the party and once again preside over the national convention when he is its president
 haal hi main samaajawaadee party ne apane rashtriya adhyaksh kaa kaarykaal teen saal se badhaakar paanch saal kar diya tha
 On top of this decision, formal approval will be taken in the national convention
 sutron ke mutabik adhiveshan ke liye jo nimantran bheje ja rahe hai unamem mulaayam sihan kaa chitra gaayab he or postaron main bhi wo najar nahin aaenge
 Meaning it is very clear that Akhilesh has been aware of mulayam-shivpal's intentions to form a separate party, Yamorcha, so he does not want to perform the ritual of giving place to Mulayam's picture
 is bich 25 sitambar ko lakhanu main hi mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi apni press conference bulaayi he
 It will be interesting to see what they announce that day
 thane main shivasena ke ek sthaneey netaa ko ek naaballig ladki se kathith balaatkaar ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The girl studied in a school run by her
 maamla tab prakaash main aayaa, jab haal main usne ek bachche ko janm diya
 Inspector of Kashimira police station, Anil Kadam said that the school owner and 61-year-old district deputy chief of Shiv Sena Vasudev Nambiar was arrested on Friday
 unhone bataaya ki ladki thane ke kashimira sthit aaropee ke skool main padhati thi
 He took the girl with him on the pretext of visiting the temple several times and allegedly raped her repeatedly at a place in Meera village in Thane district in February this year
 police nireekshak ne bataaya ki aaropee ne ladki ko dhamkee bhi di ki yadi usne kisi ko is bare main bataaya to use gambhir parinaam bhugatne honge
 He said the girl later became pregnant and gave birth to a baby prematurely this week
 police adhikari ke anusaar bachche ke janm ke baad aspataal adhikariyon ne iske bare main police ko soochna di
 a case was registered against him on Thursday and he was arrested on Friday
 use sthaneey magistrate adaalat ke samaksh pesh kiya gaya, jahaan se use 11 sitambar tak police hiraasat main bhej diya gaya

 Apart from the cities of Madia and Idlib in Syria, there are about 15 areas where hunger has become present in front of about four lakh people
 bhukh ne is shahar ko itnaa bhookha bana diya ki jinda rahane ke liye logon ko apane hi paaltu kute or billiyon tak ko khaanaa padaa
 Now there are no dogs and cats left in the whole city
 hajaaron bachche ghaas or gatte kha rahein logon ko naa to ilaake ke baahar nikalne kii ijaajat he or naa hi kisi ko baahar se aane kii
 So to stay alive all the important things, including food, water and medicines, all got away from these people

 Every group is saying that its fight is only with the opposing army and not against the common people
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki gherebandi dushman ko kamjor karne ke liye he, taaki un tak rasad naa pahunch sake or wo tut jaaen
 The worst is the situation in areas such as Madaya, Kefraya and Fauva
 eent or kancreet kii deevaaron or malbon se ghire yahaan ke logon ke paas ab jinda rahane ke liye kuch bhi nahin bachaa he
 All routes closed last year On December 26 last year, the Syrian army closed all routes to these areas

 Amid worsening conditions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, US President Barack Obama can change his strategy
 obama ne kaha he ki sirf jang se kaam nahin badalane vaala, baatcheet ke daravaaje bhi kholane honge, lekin iske liye us taliban se baat kerani hogi, jo tarakkeepsand ho
 This strategy can be exactly what Iraq succeeded
 obama ke mutabik afghanistan or pakistan main is tarah ke maukey hasil ho sakate hai, jahaan ye ranneeti kargar ho jaae
 Even during his election campaign, there were such things that Obama should explore the possibility of keeping aside any part of the Taliban
 obama ne iraq main america muhim ke aguva general david pitrius kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Obama said that according to General Pietrias, the success in Iraq was also a strategy for negotiating with those who are troubled by al-qaeda, who may be stingy, but want to walk with America

 Things are not the same as before
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ab skulon main shikshakon kii kami ko dur karne ke saath-saath toilet, pine ke saaf pani or baaki moulik suvidhaon ke alaava behatar shiksha ke liye maahaul bhi taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he

 After getting the answer from the government, the High Court admitted that the conditions of government schools are improving but much more is yet to be done
 sarkaar ne hoicourt se kaha ki nijee skool 7 janvari ko daakhile ke liye jari disha-nirdesh se bacchon ke skool chunane ke adhikaron ke hanan kii baat kar rahe hai, to kya skulon ke sangh jo yachikakartaon main he, bacchon ko unke pasand ke skool main daakhila sunishchit kar sakate hai
 The government said in question that if a child says that he has to study in a modern school, can the school ensure admission of that child
 kya skool bacchon ko unke marji ke skool main daakhila denge
 The next hearing on the High Court case will be held on Monday

 com / rpalhrmfxa Nitish Kumar has now become the Chief Minister of the state for the sixth time after the fast-moving political events in Bihar
 modi se lekar yogi tak unhen twitor par badhai de rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar is once again with BJP, he has left Lalu Ka
 susheel modi ne bhi ek baar phir up mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee he
 But, remind you that a few months before the election, these same Nitish Kumar had described BJP as 'bhujang'
 nitish kumaar ne us vakt ek twit kiya tha jo rahimadas ke dohe kii pankti thi, "chandan vish vyapat nahin, lipte rahat bhujang"
 This tweet created a lot of uproar in the politics of Bihar, at first people thought that this tweet was made about the latest 'mahagathbandhan' and especially Lalu, but later JDU clarified that this tweet was made about BJP 
 ab nitish ek baar phir us vakt ke 'bhujang' ke saath hai
 On this occasion, we are going to tell you what happened after that Nitish first 'rebelled' with Modi and then again reached his 'refuge'
 nitish kaa ahm he mahatvapoorngaur se dekhen to is raajnneetik uthapathak ke peeche nitish kumaar kaa 'ahm' saaf najar aata he
 There are many such leaders in the country's politics who have been accused of many kinds but they continued in their posts until the court convicted them
 tejasvi ke maamle main abhi jaanch chal rahi he lekin nitish jhukna bilkul pasand nahin karte
 They did not want to taint their clean image so they split up
 lekin phir ve bijepi se kyon alag hue ye sawaal bhi uthta he
 Nitish Kumar was also important behind this
 darasal, nitish kumaar modi ko apane upar bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe the
 Nitish Kumar had played an important role not only in Bihar politics but also in the politics of the country
 ve apane samakaksh rajanetaaon ke netritv main kaam karne ko taiyaar the lekin apane se kamatar netaa ke saath nahin
 This was the reason that when Narendra Modi's name came forward in bjp's Goa meeting, he raised Advani's flag
 or antat: modi kaa rath rokane ke liye apane dhur-virdohi lalu prasad yadav kii argedy, samaajawaadee party, janata dal (secular), indian neshnal lok dal, samaajawaadee janata party (rashtriya) ke saath milakar mahagathbandhan bana liya
 The same thing happened in Bihar, the BJP had to face a severe defeat and had to settle for only 58 seats with the loss of 37 seats
 nitish us vakt kendriya mantri the jab modi bijepi ke mahasachiv bane theapako bataa den ki 1998 main gujarat main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kii jeet kaa sehara modi ke sir bandhaa tha or unhen usee saal may main rashtriya sachiv pad se aage badhaakar bijepi kaa mahasachiv banaaya gaya tha
 But at the same time Nitish Kumar was holding the post of Surface Transport Minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 2001 main jab bijepi ne modi ko gujarat kii kaman sanbhaalane kaa mauka diya us vakt nitish kumaar kendra sarkaar main krishi mantri the
 After the Ministry of Agriculture, Nitish Kumar also held the Railway Ministry for many years
 iske baad ve bihar ke mukhyamantri bane pehle march 2000 main mahaj 8 din ke liye phir 24 november 2005 se lagaataar bane rahe bas bich main sirf 278 dinon ke liye unhone apni gaddi apane netaa jithan ram maanjhi ko saunp di thi
 Manjhi was the Chief Minister of Bihar from 20 May 2014 to 22 February 2015
 udhar modi kul 4610 din gujarat ke mukhyamantri rahe
 Modi assumed power in Gujarat on 7 October 2001 and he remained in the post till 22 May 2014 until he became Prime Minister
 spasht he ki nitish kaa kad us daur main modi se kahin bada tha
 Due to which he strongly opposed the Gujarat riots and at the same time when Modi's stature started growing in central politics, he put forward Advani's name for the Prime Ministerial candidate and eventually left the BJP
 samay ke saath bijepi or nitish donon ko ai akalbihar kii haar ne jahaan bijepi ko yah ehsaas kara diya ki bihar kii raajnneeti main nitish kumaar kaa kad kaaphi bada he
 At the same time, bjp's successive victory under the leadership of modi-shah duo made Nitish Kumar realize that if Bihar is to remain in power for the next few years, it will have to remain with the BJP
 modi ko sabak sikhaane ke liye kiya lalu kaa istemaal!ab jab nitish kumaar ek baar phir bijepi ke saath hai to ab un par yah tohamat lagani tay he ki nitish kumaar ne modi ko sabak sikhaane ke liye hi lalu kaa istemaal kiya tha
 The mathematics of the assembly also points to this
 nitish kumaar bijepi main kam sankhya vaale kurmi jati se aate hai to lalu yadav kaa vot bank yadav ke saath-saath muslim tha
 Nitish used to understand that if both fought separately they could never win
 yahi vajah he ki 2015 ke chunaavon main jahaan jediu or argedy ne 101-101 siton par chunaav ladaa to congress ko 41 siten deen
 While Lalu's party won a total of 80 seats, Nitish's party won 71 seats and the Congress won only 27 seats
 sabase badi party hone ke baavjood lalu ne mahagathbandhan kii shart ke mutabik nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri banwaaya
 But after 20 months , Nitish Kumar understood that if he stays together now, his image can be damaged, after which he resigned from his post on 26 July 2017 and once again with the support of BJP on 27 July 2017 in Bihar
 Sworn in as Chief Minister

 While giving an important verdict, the Supreme Court has said that those serving life sentences in the case of rape and rape and murder cannot be released by giving exemption in sentence
 apane puraane adeshon main sanshodhan karte hue supreme court ne deshbhar main umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahe doshiyon ko vakt se pehle reeha karne ke faisle par lagi roak hataa lee
 But also imposed many conditions
 supreme court kii paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne guuruuvaar ko ye aadesh sunaae
 The Supreme Court said that now states will be able to release the convicts of life imprisonment but certain standards have been set for this
 rape or rape va hatya ke doshi ko umrakaid se rihaai nahin di ja sakati
 In cases where a central agency like CBI has investigated and in cases where the Central Act has been put in place, the culprits of the accused cannot be released
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court said that the cases in which the court has written the entire life imprisonment for life imprisonment in the order and those who have written the order to spend at least time in jail, also cannot be relieved
 udhaaharan ke taur par kai maamalon main court tay karti he ki doshi ko umrakaid main 20 yaa 25 saal tak vakt se pehle reeha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This means that the government cannot consider the decision to release his application before this time
 prasal kanoon main praavdhaan he ki umrakaid ke doshiyon ko 14 saal yaa phir 20 saal kii kaid ke baad sajaa main chhot di ja sakati he
 In fact, in July last year, during the hearing of the release of Rajiv Gandhi's killers, the Supreme Court had told all the states that no life imprisonment would be released
 supreme court ne kaha ki ab rajya umrakaid ke doshiyon ko reeha kar sakenge lekin iske liye kuch maanak tay kiye gaye hai
 Those convicted of rape and rape and murder cannot be released from life imprisonment
 jin keson main sibiai jaisi central agency ne jaanch kii he or jin maamalon main central act lage hai, unke doshiyon ko bhi reeha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The comments supreme court ne kaha ki jin keson main court ne aadesh main umrakaid ke liye puri umr kaid main likhaa he or jinamein kam se kam vakt jail main gujaarne kaa aadesh likhaa he, unhen bhi raahat nahin di ja sakati
 For example, in many cases, the court decides that a convict cannot be released for life for 20 or 25 years ahead of time
 iskaa matlab he ki sarkaar is vakt se pehle uski arji par reeha karne ke faisle par gaur nahin kar sakati
 The Darsal law provides that the convicts of life imprisonment may be exempted from imprisonment after imprisonment for 14 years or 20 years
 darasal rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii rihaai ke maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan pichley saal july main supreme court ne sabhi rajyon se kaha tha ki kisi bhi umrakaid ke doshi ko reeha nahin kiya jayega

 Former captain Kapil Dev feels that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team should have won the match against England and the bowling of the team is a matter of concern
 kapil se jab bhartiya gendbaajon ke pradarshan ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ham dekh sakate hai ki gendbaaji kamjor he
 i do not need to say that
 unhone kaha, agar aap gendbaajon kii tulana team ke ballebaajon se karen to haa, nishchit rup se gendbaaji kamjor he
 But this does not mean that they cannot bowl at all
 unhone kaha, ye vahi gendbaaj hai jinhone pichley do varshon main bharat ko kai maichon main jeet dilaayi he
 Indian batting against Bangladesh and England was excellent but the bowlers disappointed
 pehle match main bhartiya ballebaajon ne 370 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha lekin bangladesh ne 283 ran banaakar behtareen ballebaaji pradarshan kiya
 In the second match, England had managed to tie the match by demolishing the Indian bowling attack led by captain Andrew Strauss
 varsh 1983 vishwa cap vijeta team ke captain kapil ne kaha, agar aap pichley do maichon main gendbaaji pradarshan ke bare main baat karen to hamaara gendbaaji prayaas stareey nahin tha
 But if our bowlers bowled poorly in the first two matches, it does not mean that they did not take wickets
 kapil ne kaha, pichley do saal main khele gayi maichon main ye vahi gendbaaj the jinhone shandaar pradarshan karke bharat ke liye kai match jite hai
 i really don't want to criticize them
 haalanki kapil ne sweekaar kiya ki kuch had tak aalochanayen to honi thi kyonki bharat ko 338 ran kaa asambhav lakshya banaakar england ko parrast karnaa chahie tha
 He said during an event here, i do not want to criticize
 lekin haa ek str par dekha jaye to aapane 338 ran kaa lakshya khadaa kiya or iske baavjood aap taai hi kar sake
 i mean England played great cricket and i think they won
 338 ran ke baad hamen haarana yaa match taai nahin karana chahie tha

" ' There has been an uproar in the street from Parliament after Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Aggarwal made a statement about Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian citizen jailed in Pakistan

 hamaare desh main bhi aatankwaadiyon ke saath aisa hi kadaa vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 Hundreds of Indians are lodged in jails in Pakistan, in which case they should also be talked about, not just Jadhav

 Such leaders should be shot first

 sarkaar ko tatkaal sangyaan lekar is par kadi se kadi karrwai kerani chahie
 However, praising the steps taken by the Modi government regarding Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Hindu Mahasabha said, "the initiative taken by the government internationally for the release of Kulbhushan Jadhav should be appreciated
" lekin sarkaar ko abhi or antarrashtriya dabaav banane kii jarurat he

 Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan on Wednesday proved themselves dwarfing Everest-like scores made by Australia's top-order batsmen's record in Jaipur to give India a nine-wicket victory in the second one-day international cricket match
 bharat ne is tarah se saat maichon kii shrunkhlaa 1-1 se barabari kii
 Five of Australia's top-order batsmen set a new record by scoring a half-century, but the unbeaten innings of Rohit (141 not out), Kohli (100 not out) and Dhawan (95) helped India reach their biggest target with 39 balls to spare
 Made his new record
 philip huge (83), eron finch (50) or shen watasan (59) ne manch taiyaar kiya jise captain george baili (naabad 92) or glen maxwell (53) ne acchhee tarah se bhunaaya
 Australia thus managed to score 359 runs for five wickets by blasting the Indian attack
 jab australia kii jeet par daanv lag rahe the, tab rohit or dhawan ne pehle wicket ke liye record 176 ran kii saajhedaari karke bharat ko behtareen shuruyaat dilaai
 Kohli set a new Indian record by scoring a century off just 52 balls and the score looked like a mountain, India gave him 43
 3 over main ek wicket par 362 ran banaakar paar kar diya
 Rohit played 123 balls in his innings and hit 17 fours and four sixes, but it was Kohli who made India's victory very easy
 unhone 52 gend kii pari main aath chauke or saat chakke lagaae
 Kohli also broke Virender Sehwag's record of 60-ball century against New Zealand in 2009 in Hamilton
 unhone van-de main saatvaan sabase tej shatak bhi lagaaya
 India had earlier won in Dhaka in March 2012, scoring 330 runs while batting in Dhaka, which was their highest ever goal to reach
 yahi nahin bharat ne november 2009 main australia ke khilaaf hi hyderabad main baad main ballebaaji karte hue 347 ran banaae the, lekin tab vah teen ran se haar gaya tha
 The pitch was conducive to batting and saw the bowling of both teams

 Dhawan and Rohit adopted the strategy to dominate the bowlers from the beginning and the foundation they laid proved to be strong in the end
 dhawan kaa shuru main bhagya ne puraa saath diya
 He was caught by wicketkeeper Brad Haddin off client mckay when he was 18
 iske baad 42 ran ke nijee yoga par vah ran out kii vishwasaneey apil se bache
 The left-handed batsman, however, could not complete his fourth century
 fahonor kii gudlength gend unke balle ko chuumati hui hadine ke dastaanon main chali gai
 Dhawan played 86 balls in his innings and hit 14 fours
 unhone or rohit ne australia ke khilaaf pehle wicket ke liye sachin tendulkar or saurav ganguli ke 1998 main kanpur main banaae gaye 175 ran kii saajhedaari ke record ko todaa
 Kohli started playing long shots as soon as he arrived
 unhone doharty par apni pari kaa doosraa chakka jadkar 30wein over main score 200 ran ke paar pahunchaa diya
 Now Indian batsmen started batting in the style of T20 and sixes started raining
 kohli ne har gendbaaj ko kadaa sabak sikhaaya
 Seeing his batting at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, it seemed as if it was the easiest task in the world
 rohit anthan ke baavjood kasar nahin chhod rahe the
 He scored his third on Johnson and completed his first century as an opener
 kohli ne bhi jald hi apana 16waan van-de shatak puraa kiya jabaki rohit ne pari ke 44wein over main maxewal kii teen gendon par chaukaa, chakka or phir chaukaa jadkar bharat ko lakshya tak pahunchaaya
 Indian bowlers again failed in the death overs
 unhone aakhri das overon main 122 ran lutaaye
 Bailey and Maxwell then only 8
 3 over main chauthe wicket ke liye 96 ran jod die
 Bailey played 50 balls in his unbeaten innings and hit eight fours and five sixes
 shrunkhlaa main lagaataar doosraa ardhshtak jamaane vaale finch ne jahaan apane aakraamak tewaron kaa izhaar kiya
 He did not mind teaching the ball outside off stump
 raina ne unhen sidhe thro par ran out kiya
 Finch scored 50 off 53 balls with the help of seven fours and a six
 unhone huge ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 74 ran jode
 Hughes then added 108 for the second wicket with Watson
 huge ne krij par samay bitaane main kuch samay liya, lekin aswin or jadeja ke khilaaf apane footwork kaa acha istemaal karke ran batore
 He played 108 balls in his innings and hit eight fours and a six
 watson ne pehle krij par paanv jamaaye or phir bharat ke donon spinneron ko kadaa sabak sikhaaya
 He went to the backfoot and took good shots at midwicket and deep midwicket
 unhone 53 gend kii apni pari main chah chauke or teen chakke jade
 After this, Bailey and Maxwell flourished
 maxwell ne keval 32 gend kheli tathaa saat chauke or ek chakka lagaaya

 Input from IANS kaha sabane, kiya mamata ne
 
 
 For the past several days, Kisan Babu Rao Hazare aka Anna Hazare was telling us this on TV
 magar jab baat tivi ke bajaay aamane saamne kii ai
 So Anna Hazare's health deteriorated
 isse sakate main ai mamata banerjee bas itnaa hi boleen ki abhi meraa kuch bolnaa thik nahin he
 i will speak only after meeting Anna
 mamata banerjee kii party trinmul congress ne buudhvaar ko dilli main ramlila maidan main raily bulaai thi
 The agenda was to put Mamta Banerjee on the national stage under the pretext of Anna Hazare
 is dauraan said kik ke rup main aise log bhi rahane vaale the, jo kabhi na kabhi khabaron main rahe
 For example, Binny of Laxmi Nagar, who, after rebelling against Kejriwal, began to identify himself as a soldier of Anna
 magar mukhya patakatha do kirdaaron ke ird gird hi thi
 Mamta and Anna
 raily subah 10 baje shuru honi thi
 But the grounds could not even fill the chairs till noon
 mamata banerjee bhi majaburi kii muskaan lekar 2 baje ke baad manch par pahunchi
 And Anna Hazare's assistant Sunita Godara is telling the media that Anna Hazare's health is very bad
 vah yah bhi kah rahi hai ki anna hajaare yahaan kisi party ke liye campan karne nahin, balki janata ko ek massej dene aae the
 But the public has given the message to Anna Hazare and other leaders
 yahi ramlila maidan tha, yahi anna hajaare the or log umad ghumad aa rahe the
 But the alleged heroes of that movement later showed the kind of political maneuvers
 sab ko samaj aa gaya ki andolan ek plateform he
 The purpose is to reach the floor holding the car
 khud anna hajaare bhi gaiyr raajnneetik manch kaa raag alaapte rahe or phir ek din mamtamayi ho gaye
 Questions are now being raised on his perceived moral leadership, his political understanding and also his constantly changing stand
 kaha ja rahaa he ki anna hajaare ko ek kotary ne gher rakhaa he, jo apane siyaasi phaaydon ke hisaab se anna kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 Anna Hazare's assistant Sunita, who pulled up the rally, also questioned the TMC leadership and made it clear that everything is not going well in this strange political alliance
 sunita ne kaha ki party ko apni raily din ke bajaay shaam ke vakt kerani chahie thi
 And Sunday should have been chosen for this
 unhone kaha ki raily kaa thik se prachaar bhi nahin kiya gaya
 He alleged that people from all over Delhi want to see, hear and meet Anna Hazare
 magar party ne iskaa thik se intjaam nahin kiya
 In such a situation, the question is arising whether the disease is just an excuse
 kyon isaki aakhri vakt par soochna di gai
 And why this is happening repeatedly with Mamta Banerjee
 pichley saal raashtrapati chunaav ke mudde par ek din mulaayam singh yadav mamata banerjee ke bagalgir the or kuch dinon baad upie ke paale main jaakar khadey ho gaye
 From then onwards, Mamta looked somewhat cautious
 vah tisare morche ke sur taal se bhi dur raheen
 When her anti-leftist made a front, Mamata ridiculed
 or uske baad mamata ne jab anna ke sahare pan
 Visited outside Bengal also, the first one came in the floor

 You must have seen many types of wedding invitation cards and many voter cards, which are almost the same
 lekin karnataka main ek yuvak ko aisa shauk chadha ki usne apane voter card ko hi nimantran patr bana daalaa

 Siddhapa feels that the message of his unique wedding invitation letter will go across the state and people will also get inspiration to vote
 siddhapa ke jaanane vaale nishad raaj kaa kahana he ki jab shaadi kaa card unke paas pahunchaa to pehali baar to unhen aisa laga ki kisi ne apana voter card bhej diya he
 He says that when he saw the card again, he again startled whether the voter card of two people was started to be made simultaneously
 voter card dekhne ke kuch der baad unhen andaja hua ki ye voter card nahin balki shaadi kaa nimantran patr he
 'donate blood to save life, vote to save the country' The special thing about this invitation card in the form of this voter card is that a message is written in Kannada language behind this card
 kannada bhashaa main card par likhaa he ki log jindagi bachaane ke liye raktadan karen or desh bachaane ke liye matdaan karen
 Let us know that the voting date in the Karnataka Assembly elections is coming closer
 aise main siddhapa ne apni shaadi ke maukey ko hi ek bada saamaajik sandesh kaa jariya banaate hue logon se apil kii he ki vah matdaan karke apni jimmedaari jarur nibhaaen

 The effects of demonetisation are not just this
 film industry bhi isse behaal he
 While the release date of 'tum Ho' and Priyanka Chopra's production house Punjabi film 'sarvan' has been pushed forward, Ajay Devgn's film 'badshaho' has to be postponed by ten days due to demonetisation
 'hamma hamma' kaa nasha phir se chadhega 'oke janu' ke saathfilm vishleshak maanate hai ki yah to bade produsar hai jo is tarah ke jatke sah ja rahe hai or ve online pement or check ke jariye apane kaam ko anjaam de rahe hai
 But things are not so easy for small producers
 kai filmon ko to agle chah maheene tak ke liye thande baste main daal diya gaya he
 Watching this dialogue promo of 'dangal' will go to 'sultan' The mistake is that no one in the film industry wants to speak against this demonetisation
 aakhir kyon? ek produsar naam na chhapane kii shart par bataate hai, 'hamen sarkaar se kai kaam padate hai
 Then the film is also known for the censors
 isliye ham kuch bhi kahkar apni film or khud ko mushkil main nahin daal sakate hai
 'really, but the pain reflected in his words can be understood as to how demonetisation has broken his back
 govinda ne dilli main kholaa 'hero number 1' restaurantrehi nahin, asli dikkat vahaan aa rahi hai jahaan film kii shooting ke dauraan kaam karne waalon ko rojaanaa ke hisaab se pement kerani padati he
 There is no money to pay for such staff and due to this the shooting of the film has been postponed for some time
 film vishleshak atul mohan kehete hai, 'iskaa asar abhi nahin to kuch samay baad najar aayega
 About one hundred and fifty films are released in Bollywood every year
 agle saal is aankade main kami darj kii jaaegi
 'he is absolutely right and it will affect the section of the film whose life is not very easy

 Students of Delhi University are getting worried about compulsory Hindi test

 Also, the end time of the semester has also been fixed for this test
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal ye khabar ai thi ki DU main hindi test ko paas kiye bina kisi chaatr ko degree nahin milegi
 After this, the students were very upset, who are from the Northeast and whose Hindi is not good
 saath hi kai chaatr aise bhi the, jinhone kaksha 8 ke baad hindi padhi hi nahin he
 Now news has come that colleges have put a notice for this exam
 inamen sabase upar naam satyavati (evening) college kaa he, jisane sabase pehle 14 sitambar ko ye notice lagaaya tha
 The notice reads, 'first, second and third year students are notified, who have not studied Hindi in class 8, 10 or 12, they will have to take the compulsory CHT exam
 ise paas karne ke baad hi unhen degree certificate diya jayega
 'let me tell you that last year, the Hindi department had said that colleges should identify students who have not studied Hindi after class 8 and a course should be started for them
 jisase ve jab uniwarsity se padhakar nikalen to unhen basic hindi kii nolej ho
 This proposal was passed by the Academic Council in July 2016
