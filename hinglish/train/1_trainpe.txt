 MP from North East Mumbai and senior BJP leader Kirit Soumayya have been accused of taking the accused from the police station and handing over the police inspector on duty
 navghar police stesan kii stesan diary main saumayya ke khilaaf aarope darj he
 According to this diary, 'when i was calling and questioning him (accused-tested land), BJP MP Kirit Soumayya entered the detection room of police station with 5-6 workers, hit him hard in the right hand and Shouted and asked why my worker was called without asking me
 
 
 use mere hawaale karo, or use lekar kamare se baahar nikal gaye
 He later went to the cabin of the senior police inspector and talked to him and left with the crush
 police stesan main aane se pehle unhone bhume ke mobile par phone karke bhi mujhe dhamkee di
 After coming, he also said that i will see you
 ' On this issue, we called Kirit Soumayya to know his side, then he started bullying his position instead of giving his opinion in this matter and started saying that i am an MP
 
 
 main jawaab dene ke liye yahaan nahin baitha
 Perhaps Inspector Sampat Munde, who is surrounded in this horror, has also not filed an FIR
 saumayya apane jis kaaryakarta kii vakaalat karne pahunche the, us par bombai police act kii dhara 37(3) or 135 ke tahat maamla darj hua tha
 Since the case was bailable, he was called to the police station, but perhaps the drunk MP of power was not patient
 isliye vardi pahane pulisavaale ne un par hathapayee kaa aarope lagaaya
 The station diary also mentions the entire incident, but the Khaki people, scared of the fear of Khadi, do not have enough courage to register a case and start an investigation

 The office that the Aam Aadmi Party got from the Delhi government has been taken away
 up rajyapal anil baijal ne aadesh jari kar is offis kaa aavanton radd kar diya he
 In fact, the Shunglu Committee report questioned this office allocation and said that since land is not the jurisdiction of Delhi government, it cannot make policy to give office / land to any political party
 aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh ne is par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki 'jis party ke vidhansabha main keval teen vidhayak hai uske paas daphtar he, jis party kaa vidhansabha main ek bhi vidhayak nahin, uskaa daphtar bhi hamaare saamne he or jis party kii sarkaar dilli main uskaa koi daphtar nahi hoga! dilli kii janata ye sab 'darty tricks' dekh rahi hai

The people of Delhi are watching all these 'dirty tricks'

 bengalooru ke anek naagarik maheenon pehle aavedan dene ke baavjood apane voter ID card se vanchit hai

 ’reporter- ‘lekin card kahaan he?’kantharaju- ‘usne yahi kaha tha ki jaldi milenge, jaldi milenge, lekin wo kabhi nahin mili
 It was six months ago

 'if India Today team talked to many more citizens in the vicinity, they too had a similar story

 In this way, Salman Khan's Ali Abbas along with Zafar has done a tremendous charisma for the third time
 salmaan khan kii film 'bharat (bharat)' ko bollywood se bhi acha rispons mila he or khub tarifen mil rahi hai
 Anyway, Salman Khan is trying to do something different in his last few films, which is also visible in 'bharat'
 salmaan khan (salman Khan) kii 'bharat (bharat)' na sirf ek shaks kii kahani he balki iske jariye desh ke badalte swaroop or isaki aatma kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 But the length of the film and the inexplicably filled songs are definitely annoying
 haalanki film ko mix rivyuu mili hai
 But the coming days are going to be very important for 'india'
 salmaan khan or katrina caff (katrina Kaif) kii jodi ko log khub pasand kar rahe hai

 On February 10, 2009, the Supreme Court reserved its order on various applications filed by CBI and it remains safe till date
 sibiai ne 30 march, 2009 ko phir ek you-turn lete hue kaha ki vah mulaayam ke khilaaf apane 26 aktubar, 2007 ke aavedan par kaayam he

 Through the open abuse of the CBI, the government has ensured that the political future of Mulayam and his family is not in any serious danger and for this he will continue to be given relief at the right time

 He said, "I think he is hungry for runs
 vah yah dikhaane ke liye taiyaar he ki uske paas ab bhi saare shaat maujuud hai

 Apart from Tendulkar, Australia's aggressive batsmen Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni have had a blunt bat, while off-spinner Harbhajan Singh's spin spell has also failed to trouble the Kangaroos
 chot se ubarkar team main vaapasi karne vaale sahvaag or yuvaraj ko to australian gendbaaji kabhi raas ai hi nahin or in donon ke ballon par is team ke khilaaf pataa nahin kyon jang lag jaati he
 Sehwag scored 34 in his career of 205 matches

 He was able to add 451 runs at an average of 55 while his performance against this team in India was also not impressive where he was 27 from six matches

 He has scored 405 runs at an average of 81 but his performance has been 49

 His condition is worse on Indian soil, where he could get only 10 wickets in 15 matches against this team, while his average was 66
 80 rahaa
 Fast bowler Ashish Nehra, who returned to the team, also got five wickets in six matches against Australia at a poor average of 67, while Ishant Sharma scored 22 in six matches against this team
 7 kii prabhavi ausat se 10 wicket chatkaaye hai lekin kharaab farm se jujhe rahe is tej gendbaaj ne bhartiya sarajameen par kabhi australia kaa saamana nahin kiya he or yahaan kii ballebaaji kii anukool pichen mejabaan gendbaajon kaa sirdard badha sakati hai
 The stock market is at new highs and on Monday the BSE Sensex set another new record by going above 22,764
 pichley kuch maheenon se share bazaar main bhalaa kii teji dikh rahi he
 It was only after the defeat of the Congress in the Legislative Assembly elections that the Sensex started climbing upwards and touched new highs many times over these days
 khaskar videshi niveshak jinhen exai kaha jaataa he, bade paimaane par bazaar main paisa laga rahe hai
 In April alone, he invested Rs 6,800 crore in the market
 janvari se ab tak unhone 28,979 karod rupye bazaar main lagaae hai
 This amount is huge and given that there are now signs of improvement in the US economy and investment doors are opening there too, it is very surprising
 amuman america arthvyavastha ke sudharne se nivesh kaa rukh udhar kii ore hona chahie tha lekin philhal ganga ulti bah rahi he
 The foreign investors who had migrated from India a year ago are now returning here with a bang for the formation of a new government and that too with a bang
 bazaar ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki upie-2 kii akarmanyata or faisle na le paane kii aapangata ne itane dinon tak bazaar ko baandh rakhaa tha
 During that time investors were away from the market and were looking for other options to earn money
 uskaa hi nateeja tha ki property or sone ke daam aasmaan chune lage the
 Actually the investor is always looking for options to earn money
 jab use laga ki share bazaar ke or badhane kii gunjaaish nahin he to vah sone jaise anupayogi vastu main paise lagane laga jiskaa nateeja hua ki vah pili dhaatu aasmaan chune lagi
 The same situation happened with the property
 yani anya vikalpon kii ore log dhyaan lagaate rahe
 But now everything has changed and investors have returned
 iskaa hi parinaam he ki suchakank yani sensex oonchaaiyon par ja pahunchaa he
 There is one more thing
 share bazaar hameshaa centement par chalate hai or yahaan vaastavik ghatnaon kaa yogadan bahut simit hota he
 Investors and market players invest money according to good or bad times to come
 yani munaafe ko pehle hi count kar liya jaataa he
 The same thing is being seen this time also
 bazaar main yah dharna he ki endie kii sarkaar banegi
 This has given rise to the hope that the coming time will be in line with the business and the economy will pick up
 narendra modi ke aane kii sambhaavna se bhi isamen khaasi teji ai he
 Market players are assuming that not only will Modi's government be strong, there will also be transparency in his policies
 wo nitiyaan jo lagu nahin ho pain, ab lagu ho jaaengi
 The country will get good governance, which Narendra Modi is promising
 or agar yah nahin ho paaya to ek baar phir share bazaar ret ke kile kii tarah dhah jayega
 Till then sit back and watch the Sensex acrobatics
 har kisi ko bhai-bahan ke paavan prem ke pratik rakshabandhan kaa intjaar rahata he
 This festival is celebrated in different parts of the country with a slight difference in customs
 rakshabandhan shravan maheene kii poornima komanaya jaataa he
 According to common practice, on this occasion, the sisters tie a thread on their brother's right wrist
 bhai apni samarthy ke anusaar uphaar detaa he
 Rakhi or Rakshasutra is most important in Rakshabandhan
 raakhi kachche soot se lekar rangeen kalave, reshmi dhaage yaa sone-chaandi ke taron se bani ho sakati he
 Generally, the brothers tie a rakhi to the brother, but the brahmin or the guru tie a rakshaasutra to everyone
 subah snaan aadi se nivrutt hokar ladkiyaan or mahilaayein puja kii thali sajaati hai
 The thali consists of roli or turmeric, rice, lamp and sweets with rakhi
 ve bhaaiyon ko roli yaa haldi se tikaa lagaati hai
 Aarti of the brothers is performed, then a rakhi is tied on the right wrist
 rakshabandhan kaa anushthan puraa hone ke baad hi bhojan kiya jaataa he
 This festival is absorbed in Indian society in such a way that religion, mythology, history, literature and films are also not untouched by it
 indrani ne baandhi thi apane pati ko rakhirakhi ke bare main bhavishya puraana main varnan miltaa he ki dev or daanvon main jab yuddh shuru hua, tab daanav haaavee hote najar aane lage
 Lord Indra panicked and went to Jupiter
 vahaan baithi indra kii patni indrani sab sun rahi thi
 She tied the silk thread on her husband's hand after being sanctified by the power of mantras
 sanyog se vah shravan poornima kaa din tha
 The story of Rakshabandhan is found in the story called Vamnavatara in Kathakandha Purana, Padmapuran and Srimad Bhagwat, associated with King Bali
 daanavendra raja bali kaa ahankaar chur karne ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ne vaaman avatar liya or brahman ke vesh main raja bali se bhiksha maangane pahunch gaye
 God demanded three steps of land in alms from Bali
 bhagwaan ne teen pag main sara akaash, pataal or dharti naap liya or raja bali ko rasaatal main bhej diya
 Bali, on the strength of his devotion, took a promise from God to stay in front of him day and night
 bhagwaan ko waapas laane ke liye naarad ne lakshmi ko ek upaay bataaya
 Laxmiji made Rakhi Dam her brother to King Bali and brought her husband with her
 us din shravan maas kii poornima tithi thi
 In Mahabharata too, the story of Rakshabandhan, Rakshabandhan also connects to Mahabharata
 jab yudhisthir ne bhagwaan krishna se poocha ki main sabhi sankaton ko kaise paar kar saktaa hum, tab bhagwaan krishna ne unki or unki sena kii raksha ke liye raakhi kaa tyohaar manaane kii salaah di thi
 In the context of Krishna and Draupadi it is said that when Shree Krishna killed Shishupala with Sudarshan Chakra, his index finger got hurt
 draupadi ne us samay apni sari fadkar unki ungali par pattee baandh di thi
 It was the full moon day of Shravan month
 krishna ne is upkaar kaa badla baad main chiraharan ke samay unki sari ko badhaakar chukaaya tha
 Historical Contexts related to Rakhi: This festival has many historical episodes
 rajput jab ladaai par jate the, tab mahilaayein unako maathe par kumkum lagane ke saath-saath haath main reshmi dhaagaa baandhti thim
 It was believed that this thread would bring him back after Vijayashree
 mewar kii rani karmavati ko bahadurshah dwaara mewar par akraman karne kii soochna mili
 The queen was unable to fight at that time, so she sent a rakhi to the Mughal emperor Humayun and sought protection
 humayun ne raakhi kii laaj rakhi or mewar pahunchakar bahadurshah ke viruddh mewar kii ore se ladaai ladi
 Humayun protected Karmavati and his kingdom
 ek anya prasang main kaha jaataa he ki sikandar kii patni ne apane pati ke hindu shatru poras (puru) ko raakhi baandhakar apana munhabola bhai banaaya or yuddh ke samay sikandar ko na maarane kaa vachan le liya
 Porus respects the Rakhi tied in the hand during the war and the promise given to his sister and does not attack Alexander in a life-threatening manner

 kabhi naa kabhi har kisi ke jivan main aisa samay jarur aata he jab vyakti naa chaahate hue bhi maansik tanaav kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 However, it is not in everyone's control to stop the causes of their stress
 lekin un vajahon se khud ko kam se kam pareshaan karnaa aap par jarur nirbhar karata he
 For which, firstly you need to understand what importance you give to your life, or how much something can affect you
 agar aapako in chizon kaa gyaan he to aap apane tanaav par jarur control kar sakate ho or agar aapako phir bhi kuch samaj nahin aata he to pareshaan naa hon
 Because we are telling you some important things, by making them part of your life, you will be able to reduce your mental stress, know what they are
 
 
 1
 Walk Straight: In a research, it has been proved that by keeping your head high, walking directly improves mood
 saath hi kandhon ko jhukaa kar chalane se vyakti ke andar negative vichaar aate hai
 So walk as straight as you can
 2
 Exercise: According to a new research, exercising at least 3 times a week reduces mental stress by 19 percent
 shodhakartaaon kii maane to eksrasij karne waalon ko kam tanaav hota he, jabaki bahut tanaav main rahane vaale log wo hote hai jo eksrasij hi nahin karte
 3
 tanaav bhare rishte se bachein:aise rishte main rahane se bachein jahaan aapke partner ko aapaki koi phikr hi naa ho
 Who insult you from time to time
 kyonki aisa rishta aapako khush karne ke bajaae tanaav main daal saktaa he
 4
 samay par soen:neend puri naa hone ke kaaran bhi vyakti tanaav main aa jaataa he
 Because if you do not sleep properly then your brain does not work properly
 jis kaaran aap tanaav ke shikaar ho jate hai
 Therefore, to stay away from stress, it is important that you get proper sleep
 5
 Find time for yourself: People in family, friends and work often get so busy that they are unable to give themselves time
 jis kaaran bhi log dhire-dhire tanaav main aane lag jate hai
 That is why it is important that you take some time for yourself in your busy life and in that time do the work that makes you feel happy
 6
 Take a short distance from digital devices: People of Internet and digital devices have become so much addicted that they have become their world
 jahaan internet science kaa ek diya hua vardaan he, vahiin yah logon ko tanaav main daalane kaa ek bada kaaran bhi ban chukaa he
 This fact has also been proved in many research
 7
 Do one thing at a time: In order to save time in a run-of-the-mill life, people often do many things at one time
 ek saath kai chizon par dhyaan dene kii vajah se unka koi kaam thik se nahin ho paata he

 sardiyaan jane vaali hai
 The time has come to keep warm clothes
 agar aap nahin chaahate ki aapke garm kapade kharaab ho jaaen to ham bataa rahe hai aapako garm kapadon ke rakh-rakhaav kaa sahi tarika
 If you adopt these methods, then in the next winter your woolen and warm clothes will remain new
 
 
 1- oonee kapadon ko hameshaa sookhe sthaan par rakhana chahie
 Due to carelessness, many times we leave woolen clothes in the bathroom which is not the right way
 jo oonee kapade aap upyog main naa laa rahe hon unhen dhoop main sukhaakar kisi sukhi or band jagah par rakh den
 2- Put the newspaper in the briefcase or box in which you are keeping clothes and put some neem dry leaves on it
 isse nami nahin rahegi or aapke kapade surakshit rahenge
 3- Liquid detergent should always be used to wash woolen clothes
 iske alaava oonee or garm kapadon ko mulaayam brush se hi saaf karnaa chahie
 Woolen and warm clothes should not be washed in the washing machine
 ye 7 aadaten hai to aap sabit honge 'bure' pati!4- nami, oonee or garm kapadon kii dushman hoti he
 Wool clothes cause fungus due to moisture which is not visible but is very harmful for health
 isliye garm kapadon ko dhoop main dikhaanaa bahut aavashyak hota he
 5- Woolen and warm clothes are very soft
 inhen garm pani se dur rakhana chahie
 Washing clothes in hot water runs the risk of shrinking
 isliye inhe thande pani se hi dhonaa chahie
 Although mild lukewarm water can be used to wash very dirty clothes
 shaadi ke bandhan main bandhane se pehle apane life partner se kar len ye jaruri baaten6- agar oonee kapadon par koi daag lag jaae to pehle pani ko halkaa gunaguna kiijie
 Keep in mind, do not heat the water too much
 ab is gunagune pani main thodaa-sa spirit mila len
 Wash woolen cloth with lukewarm water containing this spirit
 7- oonee kapadon ko press karte samay saamaanya aayan ke upyog se bachanaa chahie
 Steam ion should always be used for woolen and warm clothes
 agar ghar main steam aayan nahin uplabdh he to oonee or garm kapadon ke upar ek sooti kaa kapadaa rakhkar press karen
 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that custodial interrogation should be avoided if the accused is cooperating in the investigation as there is considerable waste, insult and slander associated with the arrest
 justiseeke sikri or jaj aaref nariman kii bench ne kaha, 'jin maamalon main adaalat kii raay he ki aaropee jaanch main shaamil hua he or vah jaanch agency ke saath puri tarah sahyog kar rahaa he or uske bhaagane kii sambhaavna nahin he to us sthiti main hiraasat main poochtacha se bachaa janaa chahie
 Arresting, insults and slander are associated with arrest
 'zyaadaatar log nahin samajhate hai antarbench ne kaha, 'giraftaar se na sirf aaropee ke liye kaaphi gambhir parinaam hote hai, balki samooche parivaar ke liye bhi or kai baar samooche samudaay ke liye
 Most people do not understand the difference between arrest in the pre-conviction phase or in the post-conviction phase
 agrim jamaanat yachika par sunwaayee karne ke dauraan aarope kii gambhirtha, aaropee kii thik-thik bhoomika ko avashya samajhnaa chahie or giraftaar se pehle adhikari ko cese diary main giraftaar ke liye avashya sahi kaarnon ko darj karnaa chahie
 The judges' bench said that once the accused is released on anticipatory bail, it would be nonsensical to force him to surrender before the lower court and apply for bail again
 peeth ne yon utpeedan maamle main 17 varshiya ek aaropee ko agrim jamaanat dete hue yah baat kahi
 In this case, charges of rape were framed in 2014
 -input bhashaa se If the Indian cricket team had not won the World Cup Trophy on 25 June 1983, then perhaps the country's football team could also be seen playing in the ongoing FIFA World Cup in South Africa today
 bhartiya footbal kaa itihaas kaaphi acha hua karata tha
 The national team qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, but were not allowed to participate due to playing barefoot
 iske baad bhi bhartiya footbal team ne safalataa kaa paracham laharaate hue 1951 or 1962 asian khelon main swarna padak jite the
 The team finished second in the 1964 AFC Asia Cup in which they also defeated a team like South Korea
 lekin england main 1983 kaa cricket vishwa cap bhartiya footbal ke liye nasoor sabit hua kyonki yaheen se footbal kii andekhi kii shuruuaat hui
 Under the leadership of Kapil Dev, India defeated the West Indies by 43 runs in the 1983 final on 25 June to clinch the World Cup title
 iske baad se bharat kaa dhyaan footbal se hatakar cricket par kendrit ho gaya
 Cricket slowly started waving highs in the country, but the level of football kept dropping
 ab sthiti aisi he ki rashtriya team jahaan antarrashtriya str par match khilne ke liye tarasati dikhti he to vahiin duusari ore ek arab kii aabaadi vaala gharelu footbal ke bajaay desh cricket or europea footbal ko pasand karata he
 Countries like North Korea and Slovenia qualify for the FIFA World Cup
 vahiin china ke baad duusari sabase badi jansankhya vaale desh main bharat main zyaadaatar yuva cricket ke banaspat footbal ko pasand karte hai lekin iske baavjood desh kwalifing round main kahin bhi nahin thahartaa
 The biggest reason for this is not being able to provide them the basic facilities, but the boiling of domestic leagues and no proper system for the development of young players is also one of the reasons for the fate of football
 agar arthvyavastha kii baat kii jaye to brazil or bharat is maamle main ekadam baraabar hai lekin yahaan cricket jaise khel par to dhyaan diya jaataa he jisamen puri kit or itane saare upkarnon kii jarurat hoti he jabaki footbal ko nazarandaaj kiya jaataa he jisamen sirf ek footbal se hi kaam chal jaataa he
 FIFA has also taken the initiative to start several 'vision programs' to help India, but that too is of no use because it is difficult to get started and there is lack of basic facilities
 sonia gandhi ke rang ne congress ko daraaya he yaa giriraaj singh ko? nigeria ke kaale rang se congress chidhati he yaa giriraaj singh? giriraaj singh ne gori chamadi par congress kii maansikta ko lekar jo kuch kaha, vah kai myanon main abhadrata se bharaa he
 It is true that Sonia Gandhi is Italian and fair skinned
 lekin is desh main aakar unhone apni chamadi hi nahin, apni aatma kaa rang bhi khurachne main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 But if Giriraj is unable to see this, then it is not just the extent of his vision, somewhere we have a very deep discrimination within Indians, which is not going on even when it is very scratched
 is bhedbhaav kaa doosraa sira nigerian logon ke rang par giriraaj singh ke bayaan se judata he
 Unfortunately here too we share in the misfortune of Giriraj Singh, who has more than one example
 kaale rang ke logon ko ham bazaar main peetate hai, or unki ladakiyon ko gharon se baahar nikaal kar jaanch ke liye majaboor karte hai
 In fact, the Indian society is so accustomed to the variety of non-equality that it does not even think of any behavior of equality
 varna kaa ek arth rang hota he or doosraa arth jati
 In this respect, our apartheid is very deep
 ham khud ko kisi ke aage kamatar mahasoos karte hai to kisi ke aage apane bade hone ke ahankaar main duube rahete hai
 This is the problem of Giriraj Singh
 ve kejariwal par hamalaa karte hai to unhen marich yaad aate hai
 When he attacks Sonia Gandhi, he remembers the color of his skin, not the good or bad effect of his association with Indian politics
 jab tak hamaare bheetar barabari kaa sahaj ehsaas paidaa nahin hoga tab tak ham kabhi kisi ke gore rang ko laanchit karenge or kabhi kisi ke kaale rang ko
 In its recent conference, the RSS talked about building a well, a crematorium and a temple in every village - the difficulty is that even its understanding of equality does not go beyond the scope of Hindutva, not the harmony and equality of the whole society
 Would do uske upar jo mulammaa chadha hua he, vah bhi apni tarah ke bhedbhaav kaa maaraa he
 People living in Shahdara and Jagatpuri are troubled by the fear of dengue these days
 yahaan par dengue se do mahilaon or ek purush kii jaan ja chuki he
 Meena of Jagatpuri was admitted to Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital (GTB) on dengue, but could not be saved
 ab dengue ne unki beti ko apni chapet main le liya he, wo bhi jitibi aspataal main bhartee he
 Kusum, a resident of Modern Shahdara, also died of dengue
 unhen ilaaj ke liye dilli ke alengepi aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, lekin unhen bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 Her husband says that dengue has spread due to lack of cleanliness
 jitibi main 260 marij bhartee hai or jis tarah se puraa ilaaka dengue kii chapet main he, use dekhte hue aspataal main alag se dengue ward bana diya gaya he, taaki logon ko sahi ilaaj mil sake
 People are cursing the East MCD for the increased risk of dengue
 logon kaa aarope he ki vakt par agar safai or foging kii gai hoti to halaat is kadar kharaab nahin hote
 The rainy season has come and people have also started using umbrellas to get out of the house
 bharat main istemaal hone vaale saamaanya chaaton yaa chhatari kaa prachlan kaaphi purana he
 But have you ever heard of an umbrella that you can use it without getting caught
 kuch dinon hi pehle hi moula naam ke ek jaadugar ne magical ambrella (jaadooi chaataa) ke saath ek ek video soshal media par post kiya tha
 In this video, a drone Umbrella is seen above Moula's head
 moula jahaan-jahaan jate hai bina stick vaala ambrella unke thik sir ke upar chalata he
 There is no need to catch this umbrella that runs like a shadow on a human being
 aapke donon haath swatantra hone ke baad aap aaraam se cycle chalaa sakate hai yaa smartphone kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 This umbrella has many other advantages in the rain
 haalanki stick na hone kii vajah se iskaa tej aandhi main udne kaa dar bhi rahegaa
 How it works - This drone Umbrella flying above the head has a chip, which is controlled with the help of an app in the phone
 smartphone se conect hone ke baad yah insaan ke sir ke upar chalata he
 This umbrella is currently being considered a prototype of sorts
 bazaar main abhi tak isaki entry nahin hui he

 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), embroiled in controversies, from the Delhi Chief Secretary to the apology has not stopped
 ab trilokapuri se 'aap' vidhayak raju dhing poster vivaad main funs gaye hai
 The poster depicts Raju Dhingan as Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar as Vikas Purush
 udhar, bijepi netaa vijendra gupta ne 'aap' par ambedkar ke chitra ke saath chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The MLA in the poster is seen wearing a blue coat like Ambedkar and holding a constitution in his hand
 saath hi poster main ambedkar ke chehre ko badalakar 'aap' vidhayak raju dhing kaa cheharaa laga diya gaya he
 When people saw this poster on Monday morning, they started creating uproar
 haalanki isaki bhanak jab vidhayak ke samarthakon ko lagi, to aanan-fanan main poster ko utarkar faad diya, lekin tab tak yah poster soshal media par viral ho chukaa tha

" ab poster ko hatwa diya gaya he
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, MLA Raju Dhingan described himself as unaware of the poster
 unhone safai di ki aas-paas ke logon ne anjaane main yah poster laga diya tha
 Baba saheb is our ideal

 "opposition leader Vijender Gupta has targeted the Aam Aadmi Party with the poster
 unhone kaha, ''main isaki ninda karata hum
 It is a work done with disdain with Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar somewhere
 ''unhone kaha ki baba sahib kaa jo kad he or samaaj main unka jo sthaan he, uskaa koi sani nahin ho saktaa
 If some people are flirting with his picture like this, then it is utterly condemnable
 unhone kaha ki is ghatana ke lieam aadmi partiko maafee maangani chahie
 The BJP has also demanded action against MLA Raju Dhingan
 bijepi ne kaha ki is puure maamle kii jaanch honi chahie, kyonki yah ek gambhir maamla he
 If such a disgusting and lewd joke is being done to the constitution makers of the country, then it is not right

 com / 5zcodvpfmm— taapsee pannu (@taapsee)april 14, 2018 The rules related to commercial vehicles have changed in Delhi, the country's capital
 darasal, ab dilli kii seemaa ke andar pravesh karne vaale har commercial vaahanon par radio frequency aaidentification (rfidi) tag lagavaana anivaary bana diya gaya he
 Commercial vehicles without these RFID tags are prohibited from entering the capital boundaries
 yah nayaa niyam beete shuukravaar se lagu ho gaya he
 These are the 13 major entry points after the order of the Supreme Court made it mandatory for any commercial vehicle in Delhi to have a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag
 is system ke tahat jo bhi commercial vaahan dilli main entry lenaa chaahate hai
 They have to carry a tag of Rs 218
 iske baad jab bhi wo commercial vaahan lekar dilli kii seemaa main entry karenge unhen apane tag main pehle se toffp hue paise se entry milegi
 In this process they will not need to stop
 yah sensor kii madad se automatic hoga
 After this, the toll will be allowed to go
 jaankaree ke mutabik kundali, rajokari, tikri, shahdara, gajipur, DND, kapasaheda, badarpur jaise 13 entry point se sabase adhik commercial vaahanon kii entry hoti he
 In this case, special attention is being given here
 bataa den ki yahaan se dilli ke 80 fisadi commercial vaahanon kii entry hoti he
 According to an official of Municipal Corporation, the installation of these tags will not cause congestion at the toll booths, which will not only save fuel, but will also help in controlling pollution
 iske saath hi toll tex vasuulne kaa kaam bhi aasaan ho jayega
 Currently, it takes three to five minutes to collect toll from a vehicle at the toll booth
 tag lagane ke baad samay kii bhi kaaphi bachat hogi
 Please tell that Delhi borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in many ways

 Someone will tell you that you will be given such a horse, from which you can get all the work done, but it will not eat anything
 yani yah ghoda bina khaae-pie rahata he
 This may sound like a story of grandmother and grandmother, but a farmer in China has shown this to be true
 china ke enyang city main rahane vaala ek kisaan ghodon se kaam karaae jane se kaaphi dukhi rahata tha
 To overcome this concern, he has invented a horse that does all the work without eating and drinking
 vah sadak par buggi khinchne se lekar kheton main hal bhi jotane main sakasham he
 This farmer named Dong Jinchen has made an iron horse
 uskaa maananaa he ki aayran horse kaa prayog shuru ho jane se duniya bhar ke ghode svachhand hokar apana jivan ji sakenge
 Humans will not be able to persecute him in the name of taking work
 china ke is kisaan kii soch or avishkaar kii charchaa duniya bhar kii media main ho rahi he
 According to the China Daily news, Dong Jinchen loved animals since childhood
 vah jab 12 saal ke the tabhi ek din unke dimag main aayaa ki insaan ghodon kaa istemaal sawari karne ke saath saamaan dhone or yuddh tak main karte hai
 a horse also does the work of humans and in return people beat and beat him
 vah bhi to ek jeev he
 In such a situation there will be many occasions when he does not feel like doing his work, but humans torture him and make him work
 inhen baton ko lekar dong sochate rahete the, ve ek din aisa ghoda banaaenge jise buggi yaa taange main istemaal kiya ja sakegaa
 Also, if this artificial horse is placed in the buggy, then sitting and sitting will have the same feeling as the original horse-drawn buggy
 is ghode main switch lage hai, jiske sahare se ise daaen, baayen, aage, peeche kisi bhi disha main modaa ja saktaa he
 The comments kai saal mehnat ke baad china kaa yah kisaan artiphisial ghoda main banane main kaamyaab rahe
 This horse made by him can be used in buggy, chariot, tanga
 saath hi isapar sawari karne main bhi pehle jaisi anubhuti hoti he

 Is long
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is ghode ko taiyaar karne main kisi mahange saamaan kaa istemaal nahin hua he
 It is made up of completely wasted goods
 chyna daily kii khabar ke mutabik dong jinchen ko bachapan se hi pashuon se lagaav tha
 When he was 12 years old, one day it came to his mind that humans use horses for riding and carrying goods and even in war
 ghoda ek to insaanon ke kaam bhi karata he or badale main log use maarthe-peetate bhi hai
 He is also a creature
 aise main kai maukey aise hote honge jab uskaa kaam karne kaa man nahin hota hoga, lekin insaan usapar atyaachaar karke usase kaam karaate hai
 Dong used to think about these things, he will one day make a horse that can be used in buggy or tanga
 saath hi is artificial ghode ko agar buggi main lagaaya jaae to baithkar waisi hi anubhuti ho jaisaa original ghode se chalane vaale buggi main hoti he
 This horse has switches, with the help of which it can be turned in any direction, right, left, forward, back
 tippaniyan After many years of hard work, this Chinese farmer managed to make artificial horse
 unke banaae is ghode ko buggi, rath, tanga sabhi main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he

 ravishankar prasad ne mana- patna main siver system main he gadabadi1 june se ab tak desh main saamaanya se 10 fisadi zyada barish1 june se lekar ab tak desh main saamaanya se 10 fisadi zyada barish hui he
 The effect of this is that water scarcity is no longer in the country
 lekin zyada dinon tak monsoon tik gaya to sardi kaa mausam jald aa jayega
 Along with this, the effect of cold weather will remain for more days
 agar 10 fisadi se zyada barish hoti he to mausam vibhaag kii bhashaa main use zyada barish kaa darja diya jaataa he
 The country has received more than 10 percent rainfall so far

 The first is - a low pressure zone is formed near Saurashtra and its associated northeastern Arabian Sea
 isaki vajah se yahaan ek chakravaat bana hua he
 The second is - a cyclonic pressure is also formed over southwest Uttar Pradesh
 teesraa he - bengal kii khadi ke uttari hisse main nichle dabaav kaa kshetra bana hua he
 Therefore, monsoon rains are not taking the name of stoppage in the entire country
 aakhir patna kyon duba, koi or shahar kyon nahin?barish to kai rajyon main teji se hui
 It is still happening, but why did Patna, the capital of Bihar, drown
 baaki shaharon main aisi kya vyavastha thi jo patna main nahin he
 The drainage system of Patna, which is being built with a smart city of about 700 crores, was not worked out
 sarkaar kaa dhyaan is taraf gaya hi nahin
 The Ganga, Punpun, Gandak and Son rivers adjacent to Patna are already flowing above the danger mark
 ab jab lagaataar kai dinon tak barish hoti he to shahar ke kharaab drenez system kii itani kshamta nahin he ki ve barish ke pani ko shahar ke baahar nadiyon main nikaal saken
 So the whole city was submerged
 aasamaani afat kaa red jone, satellite kii najar main dekhen bihar main baadh kii tabahidoosraa sabase bada kaaran he patna kii bhugolic sthiti
 The city of Patna is in a bowl-like shape
 bhugolic sthiti dekhen to ye nichle ilaake main he
 That is, the city water does not come out when there is too much rain
 zyada barish hone par nadiyon kaa pani bhi shahar main ghusane lagata he
 In recent years, Mumbai and Chennai are the latest examples
 agar videsh kii baat karen to netherlands bhi katore jaisi bhugolic sthiti main basaa he
 But the drainage system is very state-of-the-art, so there is no water in heavy rain

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film is being released on January 25 amid controversy over Padmavat
 padmavat ke vivaad kii jad main kathith aitihaasik kahani kaa chithran he
 However, following the instructions of the censors, the makers have made it clear that its story is basically based on the work 'padmavat' by the poet owner of Awadhi Mohammad Jayasi
 kisi kitaab par aadhaarit filmon kaa chitrankan karne main mul kahani kaa varnan or ghatnaon kaa chhot janaa aam he
 This is often seen especially in popular Hindi cinema
 aise main ham apane pathakon ko 'padmavat' se un chuninda varnanon ko bataane kii koshish kar rahe hai, jaisaa jaaysi ne likhaa he
 After seeing all the promos released by the trailer and the makers, we are presenting such an untouched part of Padmavat in installments
 pehali kisht main padhie, padmini ke pita, unke nagar or aishwarya kaa vivaran
 
 
 
 pehla khand : stutijayasi kii padmavat main kul 33 khand hai
 The first section begins with Stuti
 isamen 192 chaoupaaiyaan or dohe hai
 The first section describes God and all his states, forms and properties
 isi khand main kavi ne apana bhi parichay diya he or guru kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 Sultan Sher Shah of Delhi, along with his army, describes Pir Syed Jahangir, his sons, daughters and Chishtis
 kavi ne apni aapangata kaa bhi zikr kiya he stuti khand ke ant main padmavat kaa kathasaar bhi varnit he
 The second section is based on the introduction of the second section 'sinhalese island description'
 isamen padmini ke pita, unke vaibhavshaalee rajya, uski shaktiyon or padmini ke janm kii dastaan he
 'dhani So Deep Jah Deepak Nari, and So Padmini Dia Avtari
 saat deep baranhin sab logu, eku deep na ohi sari jogu
 Did not give lamp, Ujiara, Saran Deep saree hoi na mercury
 'jaaysi ke varnan main sinhaladweep aisa mulk he, jisamen jiskaa jo rup he use vah vaise hi najar aata he
 It is such a blessed island where women are like lamps, where God himself incarnated Padmavati
 saat dwipon kaa varnan kiya jaataa he, par ek bhi dweep kii isse tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Diya Island does not have the same light
 saran dweep bhi sinhal kii barabari main kahin nahin thahartaa
 And Jambu Island is also not the same
 lankadweep uski parchaai ke baraabar bhi nahin he
 The island of Kush is forested
 or marusthal dweep to manushyon ke rahane ke laayak hi nahin
 Among all the islands, there is no island better than Sinhala island
 padmavat ko lekar bhadki actress, kaha- rape, yon shoshan or bhrun hatya karo bansansar ke duusare indra kii tarah the padmini ke pitapadmini gandharva sen kii beti hai jo yahaan ke raja hai
 Jayasi writes - 'even more than what the kingdom of Ravana has heard in Lanka, Gandharvasen's equipment was there
 unke paas 56 karod sainikon se sajjit dal tha
 There were 16 thousand horses in the mews
 ye ghode tushaar desh se laae gaye the, jo shyamvarni ghodon ke vanshaj the
 Gandharvasen had seven thousand Sinhalese elephants like the Airavat elephant of heaven
 gandharvasen kii abha sansar main duusare indra kii tarah thi
 This Chakkwe Raja is in all parts, no one is there, no one else is there
 gandharvasen aisa chakravarti raja tha chaaron khand main jiskaa log bhay karte the
 Nobody equaled them, bowed their head in front of them
 jaaysi ke varnan main us dweep kii khubsuurati kuch aisi he ki uske najadik maatr jaakar logon ko lagata tha jaise swarg ke paas aa gaye hon
 a country where there is a cold weather such as Jeth
 barish ke dauraan raat jaisaa andhera ho jaataa ha
 The mango orchard there grows in six seasons
 as ambrou saghan ghan barni na paru ant, phulai ferai chhanhu ritu janhu sadaa basant
 The weather there is always like spring season
 jaaysi kehete hai, 'vahaan tamaam tarah ke fal phool or mewa hai, kai kaa wo naam tak nahin jaanate
 Whoever tasted them, would be tempted
 vahaan ke panchi maahaul ko or romantic bana dete hai
 As if you are taking the name of the gods in your language
 bas coy ke bolne par kolahal hota he
 'there are well steps on the steps
 kunda hai
 They have stairs at the bottom
 koi brahmacharj panth laage, koi digambar achhahin naange
 Koi surasati siddhi koi jogi, Koi niraas cult sit bogi
 inke naam tirthon par rakhen hai
 On their banks are monasteries and pavilions
 jahaan bade rishi sanyasi upwas kar rahe hai
 These are not modest, some are digambaras, some are proven Saraswati and some are Maheshwar
 jain sadhu bhi hai

 It also has the aroma of Karpoor
 lanka dweep se laae pattharon se iske kinaaron par chaar ghat banaae gaye hai
 The sail is also tied on them
 sarovar main camel dal bhi hai
 The swans of the lake are playing in the water, swallowing the beads
 sinhaladweep kii auraten padmini jaisi sundar hai -aanvaahin jhund so pantihi panti, gavan sohai so bhaantihi bhatijason vai herahin chakh naaraa, baank nain janu hanhin kataari
 The women who come to fill the water at Sarwar are beautiful like Padmini caste
 unka sharir camel kii gandh se mahaktaa he
 She is so beautiful that she looks beautiful in various ways while walking
 mahilaayein prasannataa or kauthuk se sarovar tak aati-jaati hai
 She looks at him as if she beats him with a sarcasm
 nagar kii basaavat -singhl nagar dekhu puni basaa, dhani raja asi jaakar dashaunchi panwari oonch awasa, janu kabilas indra kar basasinhal nagar kii basaavat ke bare main jaaysi kehete hai- vah raja dhanya he jisaki aisi sthiti he
 Sinhaldwip has high gates and lofty dwellings
 maano swarg main indra kaa bhawan ho
 King Ranka is all happy in this state
 jise dekho vahi hansata hua najar aata he
 Seating platforms in this country are also made of sandalwood
 chaoupaalon ke khambe bhi chandan ke hai
 All this is visible in the city of Indrasana, Amravati
 logon ke baatcheet kii bhashaa shuddh sanskrit he
 In house to house, Padmini fascinate women with the appearance of form
 nagari ke bazaar bhi dekhne yogya hai
 There are heaps of pearls, pearls and diamonds in the market
 kasturi chandan kaa bhandar laga hua he
 There are only four Garhapati, Asupati, Gajapati and Narpati on the citadel
 sab k dhaurhar sonai saja, ou apane apane ghar raja
 Looked again, Raj Duaru, i did not get lost
 hasti singhli baandhe baar, janu sajiv sab thadh pahaaraa
 Four people settle above the citadel in Sinhala
 gadhpati ashwapati, gajpati or narpathi
 Everyone's palace is adorned with gold
 sab apane gharon ke raja hai
 Paras stones are in his body
 kisi ne jivan main dukh yaa chintaa ko nahin janaa he
 No one equals him in Khadg Daan
 solah sahas padumini rani, ek ek te rup bakhaanin
 Very beautiful and very beautiful, the flowers are full of water
 tinh upar champavati rani, maha surup paat paradhani
 Sinhalese elephants are tied at the Rajdwar
 ye itane taqatvar hai ki dharti se unka vajan saha nahin jaataa
 Earth shakes
 raja ke nile samand ghodon kii kya bakhaan
 The whole world knows their movement
 ye aise ghode hai jo ishaare paae to samudr par bhi daud sakate hai
 The Raj Sabha of Gandharvasen seems to sit as if it were a gathering of Indra
 jis asana par raja baithte hai uskaa chhatra aasmaan ko chuta najar aata he
 The form of the king is as if the sun is burning
 rajmandir ke ranivas main padmini jati kii solah sahastra striyaan hai
 Everyone is very beautiful and very delicate
 ye keval paan phool khaakar jinda rahati hai
 Above all this, Rani Champawati is
 wo maharupashalini or pattamahadevi ke pad kii adhikarini hai
 All queens bow down to him
 vah roj alag-alag saaj-sajja main sundar dikhaai padati hai
 In Jayasi's Padmavat, the birth chart begins after the Stuti Khand and Sinhaldwip narration section
 isi khand main rani padmini ke janm kii kahani he
