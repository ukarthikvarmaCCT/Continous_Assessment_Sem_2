 US President Barack Obama announced the killing of Laden (54) on Monday morning and a crowd gathered outside the White House shouted slogans of 'america America'
 abhiyaan kaa byoraa dete hue obama ne kaha ki pichley hafte unhone jor dekar kaha tha, ‘‘osama bin laden ko nyaay ke kathghare main laane ke liye karrwai karne or abhiyaan chalaane ke liye hamaare paas paryaapt khufia jaankaree he
 "he said," Today, on my instruction, the US launched a campaign targeting that compound of Abbottabad in Pakistan
 ’’ abotabad islamabad ke 150 kilometre uttar main sthit he
 "I can tell the American people and the world that America has launched a campaign in which thousands of innocent men, women and children are responsible for the deaths of al-qaeda leader and terrorist Osama bin Laden," Obama said in a world-name address from the White House's East Room
 Was killed ’’america raashtrapati ne jaise hi laden ke maare jane ke bare main ghoshnaa kii washington main white house ke baahar or neuyark main turant jashn shuru ho gaya, jahaan das saal pehle world trade centre ke tower par hue aatanki hamale main teen hajaar se adhik log maare gaye the

 Describing Laden's death as "the most important achievement" in the war, Obama said, "we must be vigilant here and abroad and we will remain vigilant
" ’’ america ke world trade centre or pentagon ko nishaanaa banane ke baad laden kaa naam duniya main sukhiryon main aa gaya tha
 The US had launched a massive operation in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan to find it
 obama ne kaha, ‘‘ham phir yah doharaate hai ki america islam ke khilaaf ladaai main shaamil nahin he or na hi kabhi isamen shaamil hoga
 Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader
 vah bahut se musalamaanon kaa hatyara tha
 "the US President spoke to Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari after the end of the campaign and told him that it was a good and historic day for both the countries
" unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen yah yaad rakhana chahie ki ham in chizon ko sirf dhan or takat ke bal par nahin kar sakate balki apane sankalp ke balboote par kar sakate hai

 arab sagar main porbandar ke pasapakistani botaki ghuspaith ko bhale hi coast guard ne naakaam kar diya, lekin kai sawaal aise hai, jinka jawaab abhi tak nahin mila he
 The most important question among them is what happened to the four people aboard the boat? The information provided by the Coast Guard headquarters attributed the inclement weather, but the important point is that when the intelligence input was received on time, why could not those four people be caught? There are many more questions that are yet to be answered
 1- 31 disambar kii raat karachi ke keti bandargah se jo boat bhartiya samudri seemaa main ghusi thi, us par chaar log dekhe gaye the
 According to information given by the Coast Guard, all four of them jumped into the water, not burned
 aise main bada sawaal yah uthta he ki inamen se koi bhi pakadaa kyon nahin gaya?2-coast guard ke aiji kuldeep singh shevaron ne shanivaar ko press conference kar kaha he ki arab sagar main pakistan kii ore se ai jis naav main visphot main hua tha, us par savaar do logon kii maut ho gai thi
 But two men jumped into the sea wearing life jackets and managed to escape
 unhone bataaya he ki naav main savaar chaaron logon ne genes or tii-shart pahan rakhi thi
 If they were not fishermen, who were they and where did they go? 3 - After the explosion in the first boat, at 5 am on December 31, a message was recorded from the second boat, which said that the boat did its job
 ab sawaal yah he ki coast guard kii itani mustaidi ke baad bhi boat apane koun se mansoobey main safal rahi?4- boat se record sandesh main sunai diya ki 'saamaan supurd' kar diya he, lekin boat main chhed ho gaya or isliye use waapas bhaagna pad rahaa he
 Surprisingly, the boat managed to return to the Pakistani border even after the message was recorded
 5-31 disambar kii subah 9 baje karachi se porbandar kii taraf aa rahi do fishing boat ke bich hui baatcheet ke record se pataa chalata he ki ye boat pakistan meritime agency or paak army ke saath lagaataar sampark main thi
 This boat is constantly being talked about in Karachi and Thailand, but even after so much input, nothing has been known about what happened to these two boats

 Even before this, many ISIS terrorists have taken them to the high buildings of the city and pushed them down from the top
 lekin is baar jis tarah se mike par munaadi kar logon ko bulaane ke baad talwaar ke zarie teen logon ke sir kaate gaye hai, wo vaaki behad ajeeb, bhayanak or chaunkaanewaala he

 yani parformens ke maamle main iphone XR zyada behatar he

 lekin ek aam yujar ke liye, aam yujar se hamaara matlab ye he ki wo smartphone kaa heavi yuj nahin karte hai or har samay apane smartphone kii speed ko lekar critical nahin hote

 iske baad company iphone XS or iphone XS Max main bhi oled panel hi yuj kiya he
 Overall, you won't like its display, while the iphone X's display is great
 cameracifhone x main dual rier camera he, jabaki iphone XR main single rier camera he
 There can be a debate on whether Apple has done a better job this time than a censor
 lekin maine kai tasviren lee hai or alag alag liting condishan main or paaya he ki iphone x se lee gai tasviren iphone XR se badhiya hai
 Now we will not go to the specifications of smartphones here, because we have told about it many times before
 ye artical donon smartphone ke yuses ke aadhaar par he
 iphone x is still a great smartphone and especially if you are thinking of getting iphone XR, then buy iphone x for a few thousand rupees, this will be a better deal for you
 donon hi smartphone parformens ke maamle main awwal darje ke smood hai
 The company has tied up with some things to keep the iphone XR low in price

 isisi cricket worldcup ke shuru hone main maheene bhar se kam kaa vakt bachaa he
 The strategy of Team India is also being discussed openly
 team india ke purv captain rahul dravid kaa maananaa he ki worldcup main team india kii bahut had tak kamyaabi viraat kohli par nirbhar karti he
 But before the World Cup, there is a need to open a winning account in Australia to reach the final of the tri-series in front of Team India
 kai jaankaar khulkar kah rahe hai ki captain mahendra singh dhoni ke worldcup ke abhiyaan or unki ranneeti main sabase ahm role test captain viraat kohli kaa hoga
 However, former captain Rahul Dravid and many other experts also believe that the Indian team relies heavily on batting
 dravid kehete hai ki viraat kohli ko acchhee ballebaaji kar match kaa tempo set karnaa hoga, jahaan se dhoni yaa raina jaise khilaadi match finishr kii bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Former South African captain Graeme Smith says that Virat Kohli has a good skill to play both spin and pace
 smith kehete hai ki kohli agar pich par jam gaye, to kisi bhi team ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho sakate hai
 He says that his conversion rate is excellent, which makes him even more dangerous
 148 vanade maichon main viraat kohli ke naam 21 shatkeey or naam 33 ardhshtkeey paariyaan hai
 That is, the chances of Kohli scoring a century are increased as soon as the half century is reached
 dravid yah bhi kehete hai ki test main bure pradarshan ke baad darasal team india kaa graph vanade main shandaar hua he
 So Team India is ranked number two in odis
 vah yah bhi kehete hai ki haalanki team main kai khilaadi aise hai, jo pehali baar worldcup khilne ja rahe hai, lekin khilaadiyon ko vanade khilne kaa acha khaasaa anubhav he
 However, 26-year-old Kohli has won the World Cup title
 lekin kohli kaa tallent 2011 worldcup ke baad or nikhar gaya he
 Virat Kohli had played 54 odis till the 2011 World Cup, in which he had scored 5 centuries
 2011 worldcup ke baad unhone 94 vanade match khele hai, jinamein unhone 16 shatkeey paariyaan kheli hai
 That is, Kohli has started scoring centuries at almost double the speed
 philhal kohli ke saamne team india ko worldcup ke dress reharsal yani carlton mid tri siries ke final main pahunchane kii jarurat he
 He has scored a total of 13 runs in the first two matches of the tri-series and Team India has lost the first two matches of the tri-series

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who reached Kerala after the Lok Sabha elections, said that those who won us are also ours, those who missed us this time are also ours
 mere liye kerala utana hi priy he, jitna ki varanasi
 Addressing BJP workers at Guruvayur in Kerala, PM Modi said that the overwhelming mandate in the Lok Sabha elections is for the creation of New India
 jahaan khaataa nahin khulaa vahaan kyon aae modipiem narendra modi ne kaha ki raajnneetik dal or chunaav karaane vaale log janata ke mood ko bhaanp nahin sake
 But people gave a strong mandate to the BJP
 kerala ko apane daure kaa pehla padaav banane par narendra modi ne kaha ki kuch log hairaan hai ki narendra modi dakshin ke kerala kyon aa rahe hai jahaan bijepi kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa he
 He further said that elections have their place in India's democracy, and it is the responsibility of the winner to take care of the interests of the entire 130 crore people
 modi ne kaha, "jo hamen jitate hai, wo bhi hamaare hai, jo is baar hamen jitaane main chook gaye hai, wo bhi hamaare hai, mere liye kerala utana priy he, jitna ki varanasi
 "varanasi has been a parliamentary constituency of PM Modi and a strong fort of BJP
 pichley do baar se piem modi yahaan se jeet rahe hai
 By comparing Kerala to Varanasi, PM Modi has also prepared an election sketch of Kerala, on which the bjp's leadership has a challenge to paint saffron
 bataa den ki pashchim bengal kii siyasat bhi lagbhag 10 saal pehle bijepi ke liye dur kii kaudi thi, lekin ek lambey plan par kaam karte hue bijepi ne is baar 18 siten jitkar vahaan apni damdaar maujuudagi darj karai he
 Like Kerala, West Bengal too once dominated the Left and Congress, but here the Left and Congress were marginalized and the BJP raised its flag on their political space
 haalanki kerala main is vakt congress or left donon hi damdaar sthiti main he or bijepi ko apni jagah banane ke liye khub mehnat kerani hogi
 BJP is flopping in Kerala, let us know that in 20 Lok Sabha seats of Kerala, BJP has suffered a severe defeat
 yahaan kii 19 siton par congress ko jeet mili he
 While CPM candidate has won one seat
 is loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko mili 52 siton main ek tihaai se zyada kerala se hi mili he
 In this context, Kerala remains the strongest Congress stronghold in the country
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi kerala ke vynad se hi jite hai
 Kerala's mandate is also challenging for PM Narendra Modi in this sense, because it is the voters who have not been affected by the Modi wave
 iske alaava 2016 main hue kerala vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi kii maujuudagi na ke baraabar rahi he
 The BJP has only one MLA in the 140-member Kerala Assembly
 dakshin ke durg main kerala, tamilnadu or andhra pradesh aise rajya hai, jahaan bijepi kamjor he
 We are not public representatives, public servants - Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on the service side of politics in Kerala and said that the people make us public representatives for 5 years, but we are public servants who are lifelong and dedicated to the public
 narendra modi ne chunaav main jor-shor se shirkat karne ke liye kerala kii janata kaa dhanyavad diya or kaha ki loktantr ke is mahaparv ko safal banane ke liye yahaan ke logon ke shukraguzaar hai

 haalanki is par abhi dushyant singh kii taraf se koi safai nahin ai he
 Earlier, Dushyant Singh has also been accused of alleged ownership of Dholpur House in the state
 congress ne dastavej pesh karmukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or dushyant sinhaper aarope lagaae the
 Jairam Ramesh had claimed Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had claimed that Dholpur Palace is the property of the Rajasthan government
 unka kahana tha ki, 'dushyant singh ne us mahal ke evaj main 2 karod rupee kaa muaavja liya tha
 This number is a scam

 ' kareeb 300 kilometre ke pahari ilaakon main dedh lakh log fanse the
 No food, no water, no roof over the head, no land lap, no roadway and no expectations of reaching the destination
 aasmaan se ai afat dedh lakh logon ko har pal maut ke kareeb le ja rahi thi
 But then life came from the same sky and saved every life
 alaknanda kii gussai saheliyon kii aisi belgaum or kaatilaanaa lehren uthin ki jo bhi unke raste main aayaa, yaa to use baha diya yaa phir itani dur phenk diya ki waapas apni duniya main aana hi unke liye mushkil ho gaya, kyonki unhen unki duniya tak pahunchane vaale tamaam jamini raste khud apni manzil se bichad chuke the
 In a radius of about 300 kilometers, more than one and a half million people were trapped in the up and down forests surrounding the uplifted rivers
 ab unki jindagi puri tarah se rahamo-karam par thi usee aasamaani madad ke, jis aasmaan se hi unke sir par musiibat kaa badal fata tha
 With this began the largest operation of the century in Uttarakhand
 dedh lakh logon ko unki duniya main ba-hifaazat waapas laane kaa oparation
 The sky was still strong
 badalon kaa jamaavada ab bhi laga tha
 The weather was still bad and the land below was absent
 udana bhi mushkil, utarana bhi khatarnaak
 But the question was one and a half million lives
 lihaaza aasmaan or zamin, donon kii ansuni kar hawaii madadgaaron ne jaan jokhim main daalkar apana ferj nibhaane kaa faisla kiya
 60 choppers reached Dehradun, including army, air force, government and non-government
 sena ke teenon angon ke alaava itibipi or biaaro ke kareeb 15 hajaar jawan qamar kas chuke the
 The most difficult review operation was outlined
 tay hua ki jahaan zaraa-si bhi gunjaaish hogi, vahaan choper utrega or fanse logon ko bachaayegaa
 Along with this, chopper queues were erected at Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun and Army Base of Gauchar
 saare choper inhen do jagahon se udne or utarane the
 But the difficulty was that in the beginning it was not known where people are stranded? Which areas need help
 lihaaza baaki jagahon se isaki jaankaree jutaney ke alaava pehali kuch udaanon ne sirf or sirf yahi pataa lagane kii liye udaan bhari
 From the first few flights, it became quite clear that where the condition is worst and where immediate help is needed
 tasviren saamne thim
 The target was detected
 lihaaza ab har choper ko alag-alag target de diya gaya or isi ke saath aasamaani madadgaar kii pehali udaan paravaaz bharti he
 The style of late destruction was awakened lately
 tabaahi or barbaadi kaa andaaza der se hua
 Due to this delay, the sky relief was also delayed in the mountains
 par ek baar jaise hi ye vahaan pahunche, bas usee vakt shuru ho gaya haal ke saalon main desh kaa sabase bada rescue oparation
 Finding one and a half million people and getting them out of death is nothing short of winning the war against a powerful enemy on the border
 emai 17 uttarakhand main army ke asthai airbase yani gochar se guptkashi tak ke liye udaan bharne ko taiyaar he
 At present, some military officers and soldiers are going to fly with food and medicines in the helicopter so that these basic necessities can be transported on time to the people trapped in the mountains as well as to the people present there
 
 taiyaari puri ho chuki he
 So, the pilot takes over his chair and then in the next few seconds the helicopter starts talking to the air
 karaab mausam or barish ke khataron ke bich pahaado ke bich hota hua ye helicopter takreeban 20 mile kaa hawaii safar puraa kar guptkashi pahunchataa he
 At this place, 22 km from Kedarnath, there are still thousands of people who need the help of the army, so that they can reach out to the safe havens
 lekin ek emai 17 helicopter ek baar main itane logon ko airlift nahin kar saktaa
 So, soldiers already present in Guptkashi now start preparing to evacuate people one by one
 iske baad pehle to air dropping ke zarie zarurat kii chizein vahaan fanse logon tak pahunchaai jaati he, phir ek-ek kar logon ko helicopter kii taraf laayaa jaataa he
 The Army has also provided tokens for this, so that old, sick, women and children can be paid attention
 ab line se ek-ek kar logon ko helicopter main jagah di jaati he
 As the Mi 17 is one of the largest helicopters in the world, it carries a total of 14 people in addition to 5 crew members and troopers, then these helicopters once again leave for their hideout
 helicopter takreeban 20 minute kaa safar tay kar gochar ke airbase tak dobaaraa aa pahunchataa he
 For all the soldiers of the army, this may be a part of their exercise, but for these people who have reached here by riding in this helicopter, it is the flight of life
 lihaaza, is udaan ke puri hone ke baad yahaan pahunche har shaks ke chehre par kamyabari or raahat kii ek lakeer dekhi ja sakati he
 Many people start crying here with their loved ones and then from here onwards their journey to their homes starts
 lekin duusari taraf isi airbase par ek doosraa helicopter zindagi kii ek duusari udaan par nikal padataa he
 The time of more than ten days is a witness to the fact that whenever these helicopters took off, the strands of countless broken breaths are connected again
 phir chaahe wo duniya ke sabase bade emai 17 or emai 26 helicopter hon yaa phir medium yaa linewet choper
 With every flight of these helicopters in the sky in spite of sheets of rain and fog, the expectation of humans suffering from nature has also taken a new flight
 is oparation main indian army or airforce ke do helicopter sabase asardaar sabit hue
 More than 20 Mi-17 and Mi-26 helicopters have shown how these machines, which can be used to transport the troops to the battlefield, can be used to save human life if needed
 yah to rahi badi mashiinon yani bade helicopter kii baat, pahaado par aisi jagahen bhi kam nahin, jahaan itane bade helicopteron ke pankhons ke liye aasmaan bhi chota pad jaae
 For such places, the Air Force had arranged 16 advanced light helicopters, which proved to be the trump card in this battle of life and death
 army ne apane is oparation ke liye gochar ko apana base camp bana rakhaa tha, jabaki baaki sarkari or gaiyr sarkari lite helicopter dehradun ke jolly grant airport se udaan bhar rahe the
 Everyday helicopters flew from these places to destinations like Badrinath, Kedarnath, Guptkashi, Uttarkashi, Harsil and Dharasu and rescued people trapped in the mountains one by one
 par kudarat kaa sitam dekhie
 There was a time when, on Tuesday, 20 soldiers embraced death while saving others
 gaurikund main airforce kaa helicopter krash ho gaya or usamen savaar sabhi jawan shahid ho gaye
 This martyrdom of soldiers was nothing short of a life in the war on the border
 helicopteron kii paravaaz chaahe jitani bhi oonchi kyon na ho, unhen utarana to zamin par hi tha
 Then, when a series of relief and rescue began on the ground, then a new story of military fights was completed
 kahin pahaado main fanse, to kahin khaaiyon main ghire hazaron logon ko nikaal liya gaya
 The attempt to win the war of life was successful with just a rope at the edge of the rising river between two mountains
 badrinaath mandir ke qareeb mandakini nadi ke upar se logon ko bachaae jane kaa manzar dekhne bhar se jism main jhurajuri paidaa ho jaati he
 But the army saved thousands of lives, not one, not two

 vitt mantralay kaa prabhaar piyush goyal ke haathon main jane ke baad kam se kam yah to spasht he ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar sarkaar kuch khaas karne vaali he
 In view of the electoral concerns of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it is certain that the Interim Budget to be laid on the Table of Parliament on the first day of February is not just a formality to present the Vote on Account, but the Government is preparing to make it something special
 is
 sanket hai ki is antarim bajet main kuch loklubhaavan ghoshnaaen jarur hongi
 Two departmental orders of the Finance Ministry seem to confirm this
 iske spasht sanket vitt mantralay ke do patron ko padhane se chalata he
 It is interesting that the Finance Ministry has made a very small amendment in its release (office Memorandum) but it will have a big impact
 pehali vijyapti 3 janvari, 2019 ko bheji gai thi, jisamen sanshodhan karte hue ab sabhi mantralayon ko nai pahalon yaa nai upayon (new megers yaa new services) ke liye kharch kaa byoraa bhejne ko kaha gaya he
 This letter has been sent by the Budget Section of the Department of Economic Affairs and the revised letter has been sent on 9 January 2019
 jaahir he, yah pehla sanket he ki sarkaar kuch bada karne kii taiyaari main he or andarkhaane kuch badi yojanaayen taiyaar kii ja rahi hai
 According to tradition, on January 3, the Department of Economic Affairs made a departmental order DO
 NO
 2 (46) -B (dy2018) was sent to the financial advisors of all ministries under the line that, "the Union Budget is usually presented in Parliament on 1 February
" chunki, loksabhaa ke aam chunaav april / may main hone kii sambhaavna he, isliye is saal centre sarkaar 2019-20 kaa antarim bajet 1 farvari, 2019 ko pesh karegi
 "in this order, all ministries were informed that after presenting the interim budget for 2019-20, the government will present a Vote on Account (april to July) for the expenses of four months of the next financial year (including expenditure on new services Will not be included) and will cover only one-third of the 2019-20 budget allocations
 'mantralayon se kaha gaya ki ve '10 janvari 2019 tak april-july ke kharch or jaruraton kii nyaaysangat samiksha karte hue apane mad bhej den
 'the first letter cautioned ministries: It is worth noting that during the period of Vote on Account
 nai sevaaon par koi kharch shaamil na kiya jaae, jab tak ki puure varsh ke liye matdaan na ho or tadnusaar adhikrut kharch ke liye vidheyak na paarit ho
 But on 9 January 2019, a revised departmental communique was sent to all the ministries, giving a new twist to the story
 is vijyapti sankhya OM (F
 No
 2 ('16)-8 (D) / 2018) ke mutabik,byore bhejte samay, sabhi mantralay / vibhaag yah note karen ki item sankhya 2 main aavashyak sabhi nai sevaaon ke atirikt byore bhi uplabdh karaae jaaen
 Both of these letters have a copy of India Today
 yah thodi choti or saadhaaran baat lag sakati he, lekin asal main isse parampara ke viruddh nae upayon ko lekar nae daravaaje bhi khul sakate hai
 However, it would not be unconstitutional or illegal for a government to introduce policies and new taxes in the budget just before the Lok Sabha elections
 baad main nai sarkaar in prastaavon ko ulat bhi sakati he
 However, the tradition has been that the government ending its term takes the recommendation of Parliament only to approve the expenses of running the government till the next government is formed
 haalanki is parampara ko pehle bhi todaa ja chukaa he
 For example, in 2014, UPA-2 Finance Minister p Chidambaram announced a 4 per cent indirect tax concession for cars and telecom handsets
 iske saath hi, car, mobile phone, tivi or frij saste karne ke liye karon main kami kaa prastaav bhi pesh kiya gaya tha
 In recent times, two major measures of the government are under discussion in the political corridors
 khabar he ki inamen se ek bhavantar yojana kii tarj par kisaanon ke liye badi ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 Through this, Shivraj Singh Chauhan's government in Madhya Pradesh used to transfer cash directly to the farmers' account and there is also talk of measures to increase the income tax limit for the working class
 kya 1 farvari ko sarkaar naaraaz kisaanon ko khush karne or madhya varg ke votaron ko lubhaane ke liye antarim bajet kaa sahaara legi? siyaasi ho-hallaa hoga jarur, par iskaa jawaab to bajet bhaashan main hi chipa he

 This village and the President's in-law? Seeing the small Losal village of Sikar district, the same words can come out of anyone's mouth
 july 2007 main desh kii pehali mahila raashtrapati bani pratibha patil ke pati devisingh kaa gaanv he yah
 But it seems from nowhere
 khet kii saakh jaise uski baaden bataati hai, usee tarah gaanv kii saakh vahaan kii sadaken or raste
 Enter the village through any road in Chhoti Losal, their shabby appearance starts telling its own story
 gaanv vaale bataate hai ki ye sadaken us vakt bani thim, jab patil rajasthan kii rajyapal thim
 Apparently, this was due to his influence
 lekin charek saal main unki haalat khasta ho chuki he
 Some villagers say that Thekvadar probably built these roads keeping in mind the tenure of the Governor
 yani 4-5 saal ye chal jaaen
 Another work was done at the same time
 gaanv ke bich pani nikasi ke liye tanks kaa nirmaan
 Now the same tank has become a symbol of life for the villagers
 aane-jane waalon se is tanks ko hatwane kii guhaar lagaatin 70 varshiya bhavari ummid bhari najaron ke saath kahati hai, ''isamen jamaa hone vaale pani kii sadaandh or isse upajane vaale machharon ne jeena muhaal kar rakhaa he
 "at that time, a dirty water tank built without thought or haste has really become a cause for trouble
" ise gaanv ke baahar sthanantarit karne kii maang kii ja rahi he
 The primary school, located one kilometer from the village, where the children of the village go to study, does not even have a boundary wall
 isaki maang lekar gaanv vaale ek dfa centre main mantri, shekhavati ke hi mahadevsingh khandela ke paas gaye lekin vahaan bhi unki sunwaayee nahin hui
 The sarpanch of the village, Laxman Singh Bhati, puts forward a wide range of problems in the village: "there is a great need to improve roads, health, water and education system
" ''kareeb 2,600 kii aabaadi vaala yah gaanv 500-600 gharon kii basti he, jahaan pani ke liye gramin aaj bhi mohataaj hai
 Women can be seen carrying water on their heads throughout the week in a month
 aaj yahaan ek achche jalashay kii sakht darkaar he
 The health of the entire village is dependent on one ANM
 pashu sampada yahaan bharpoor he lekin pashu chikitsaalay maujuud nahin
 Why does Chhoti Losal seem so backward despite being in-laws of the President? In response Ghasiram of the village says, "pratibha ji did not come here after sitting on the chair of (the President)
" unke pati devisingh 2-3 baar aae
 The condition of the village is hidden even from them
 kai baar unhen iske bare main bataaya bhi gaya
 Still the whole situation is in front of you
 '' ghasiram ke bagal main hi khadey ek shaks ne tabhi apane dil kii baat kah di, ''pratibha ji rajyapal hi thik thim
 While at that position, he built at least two-three roads
 '' baat gauratlab he

 That means big leaders got a lot of work done in their respective areas
 par choti lozal kaa kayapalat na ho sakaa
 It is not that people here do not have an affinity for their President
 patil jab raashtrapati bani to gaanv me diwaali-si manaai gai
 People went to Delhi after filling two or three buses from Chhoti Losal to congratulate Patil
 mahamahim ne unke saath baqayada pha to bhi khinchvaai
 Since then, these people have been watching His Highness in photographs

 Film: Badmashian - Fun Never Ends Director: Amit khannastar Cast: Suzana Mukherjee, Siddhant Gupta, Sharib Hashmi, Gunjan Malhotra, Karan Mehra Period: 128 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 1 Star 'con' means cheating stories like Bluffmaster, Bunty and Babli , Dolly's Doli and now Rogues
 aisa nahin lagata aapako pataa chal gaya kya he film? ji, dhokhe par banane vaali filmon ke kram main nae entry lekar aae hai filmkaar amit khanna
 Let's find out how different this film is
 kahani:film kii shuruyaat hi plot ko bayaan kar detii he
 In Chandigarh, Nari (susana Mukherjee) betrays her debt-ridden boyfriend Dev (siddhant Gupta) and runs away with her money
 phir yah uske liye paise kamaane kaa jariya ban jaataa he
 His next target is Jazzy (sharib Hashmi), who plays a local don
 film main pinkesh (karan mehara ) bhi hai jo dev kaa dost he lekin use bhi nari se ishq he jiskaa izhaar vah kabhi nahin karata
 The woman is also blown away by Jazzy and Don Sahib starts looking for her
 yani ek tarah se alag-alag lav stories kaa trek ek saath lekar masala film banane kii koshish kii gai he
 Why see: If you are crazy about any of the actors mentioned above, then only watch this film
 shaarib hashmi, jinaki film 'filmistan' kuch logon ko pasand ai thi, is film main bhi thodi bahut chhap chhodte hai
 Why not see it: When a lot of stories go on in the same film at the same time, they confuse you and the result is the same
 script kaaphi dhili he or aisa koi dialog nahin he jo aapako chaunkaae yaa chamatkrit kare
 Overall, there is nothing in the film that makes you excited
 gane bhi khaas prabhavit nahin karte

 India has managed to score only one triple century in Test cricket so far, that too twice, but Virender Sehwag, the 'nawab of Najafgarh' who has done this unique feat, regrets that he will ever score 400 runs
 Could not touch haal hi main ritairement kii ghoshnaa karne vaale virendra sahvaag ko guuruuvaar ko didisie ne firozshah kotla test match se thik pehle sammanit kiya
 Sehwag came to the Kotla ground to watch the match with his entire family, and the effect of his excitement among the fans remained intact even at that time
 phans unase autograph lene ke liye chakkar lagaate rahe, or viru kii nazaren maa, patni or donon bacchon ke saath lagaataar maidan par tiki raheen
 
 
 He continued to be a center of attraction for those sitting around him
 match ke dauraan viru ne camentator harsha bhogale ko bataaya ki cricket main ranon ke liye unki bhukh kisi thi
 Actually, Virender Sehwag is the only Indian batsman to have played two innings with a triple century
 lekin unka kahana he ki unhen is baat kaa malaal he ki vah 400 ranon, yani cricket main sarvaadhik (bryan lara ke 400) ranon kaa aankada paar karne se chook gaye
 Sehwag says that he crossed the 300 mark twice (309 runs, against Pakistan in Multan in 2004 and 319 runs, against South Africa in Chennai in 2008)
 vah kehete hai ki us vakt vah 400 kaa aankada paar kar sakate the
 Apart from Sehwag, two triple centuries in Test cricket are also in the account of Sir Don Bradman, Chris Gayle and Brian Lara, while Sehwag also has six double centuries
 sahvaag se zyaada dohare shatak lagane vaale paanch ballebaaj hai, jabaki sahvaag jitne hi (chah) dohare shatak lagane vaale bhi chaar cricketer or hai
 The comments 23 test shatak or 15 van-de shatak laga chuke virendra sahvaag ke naam cricket main kai aise record hai, jinhen jaankaar bade chaav se yaad karte hai, lekin usase bhi badi baat he, unka bebaaki se balle chalaane kaa andaaz, jise yaad kar ab bhi mahasoos hota he, kahin bhi koi bhi or khilaadi sahvaag kaa andaaz nahin dikhaa paaegaa
 Regardless of Sehwag's 319-run record, he has promised his children that if they cross this figure in any level, they will give him a Ferrari car

 sahvaag ke alaava test cricket main do tihare shatak sar don breadman, kris gail or bryan lara ke khaate main bhi hai, jabaki sahvaag ke naam chah dohare shatak bhi darj hai
 There are five batsmen scoring more double centuries than Sehwag, while there are four more cricketers who have scored as many (six) double centuries as Sehwag
 tippaniyan Virender Sehwag, who has scored 23 Test centuries and 15 one-day centuries, has many such records in cricket, which the experts remember with great fervor, but even more than that, his style of batting with impunity is now remembered There is also a feeling, that no other player will be able to show the style of Sehwag anywhere

 ) jammu-kashmir main congress or neshnal conference kaa teen saal purana gathbandhan tut chukaa he
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a special interview given to Aaj Tak, 'the National Conference had decided to break the alliance
 is silsile main 10 din pehle maine congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main akele chunaav ladane kii baat kahi thi
 Omar said that some Congress leaders in the state were not in favor of contesting elections together with the National Conference for quite some time
 isiilie hamane aagaamee chunaav main akele hi chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 Omar objected to the Congress' announcement of breaking the alliance
 unhone kaha ki agar ye elaan donon partiyaan milakar karti to zyada behatar rahata
 The Congress tried to present the announcement as if it was their decision
 jabaki hakeekat isse alag he
 The party's experience of the last election with Congress has not been good
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad aagaamee chunaav ke liye neshnal conference kii taiyaari ke bare main umr ne bataaya ki yah vidhansabha chunaav sabhi partiyon ke liye kathin rahenge
 If a party feels that the election is easy for them
 to yah unki galatfahami hogi
 The situation has changed between the party's movement due to the parliamentary elections, but the party's land is not completely ready in the state
 umr ne gathbandhan kii sarkaar ke rajya main banane kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main kaha, 'voter agar phir gathbandhan kii sarkaar chahta hoga
 Then he will vote for the same government
 meraa maananaa he ki gathbandhan kii sarkaar rajya ke liye thik nahin he par yah faisla voter par he ki vah kisi sarkaar chahta he
 Regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tendency towards Jammu and Kashmir, Omar said that Modi has a special interest in the problems of Jammu and Kashmir
 aise sanket abhi tak hamen nahin mili hai
 Modi either does not understand Kashmir's internal politics, geography and problems, or he is not wanting to understand it
 umr ne bataaya,' jammu ke liye iaiti kaa elaan or kashmir ko kuch na diya janaa logon ke bich galat sandesh pahunchaa saktaa he
 Modi is doing this intentionally to push the Kashmiris back, either, they are not understanding the politics here
 is bare main aane vaale vakt main hi kuch kaha ja saktaa he
 Omar Abdullah hoped for better electoral results in the upcoming assembly
 umr ne kaha, 'aane vaale chunaav main neshnal conference pichley chunaav kii tulana main behatar pradarshan karegi'
 Significantly, on Sunday, Congress General Secretary Ghulam Azad made a formal announcement to break the coalition from the National Conference
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki party chunaav main sabhi siton par akele hi utregi

 Amidst the separation of two important members from Anna Hazare's team, the Gandhian leader has said that ego should be kept separate in the social sphere
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki koi bhi ataarkik bahes unki ichhashakti ko samaapt nahin kar sakati
 On his blog, 74-year-old Anna Hazare wrote, "my movement has led to inconsistent debate in political circles
 main unki taraf dhyaan nahin detaa
 i have heard the irrational debate and its misinterpretation, which is mainly due to political rivalry
 yah pichley 30 saal se meri jindagi kaa hissaa he
 But all these fail to dissipate my will
 " anna hajaare ne likhaa, "yadi aap saamaajik kshetra main kaam karte hai to aapako apana ahm dur rakhana hoga or apmaan tathaa pratadna sahani hogi
 Only then can social workers do constructive work in the interest of the nation
 " unhone kaha ki sabhi ko sachai ke raste par chalanaa chahie, kyonki satya sarvocch he
 It is noteworthy that Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh and Gandhian PB Rajagopal had announced to separate themselves from Anna Hazare's team on Tuesday, blaming Arvind Kejriwal's alleged arbitrary attitude and being 'political' of the group

 com The whole world warmly welcomed the New Year, during which everyone was immersed in celebrations
 lekin america sena kii stratagic cmand ne jab ek majaak ke saath logon ko nayaa saal vish karnaa chaha to ye pasa ulataa pad gaya
 The army had tweeted that he could drop something big on Times Square on the occasion of the New Year, which was widely criticized on social media
 darasal, america kii stratagic cmand (@us_stratcom) ne navvarsh ke avasar par times squaire par paaramparik crystal ball se bhi bada kuch giraane ke liye taiyaar hone sambandhi apane ‘‘anuchit’’ majaak ko lekar somvaar ko maafee maangi
 The Army tweeted that it was ready to drop something "much bigger" than a traditional crystal ball at Times Square in the New Year
 Our previous NYE tweet was in poor taste & does not reflect our values
 We apologize
 We are dedicated to the security of America & allies
 - US Strategic Command (@us_stratcom) December 31, 2018 The military force, which controls the US nuclear arsenal, released a video on Twitter showing the B-2 bomber dropping the bomb
 is video ke saath sandesh likhaa gaya tha, ‘‘yadi kabhi aavashyaktaa padi, to ham isse kuch bahut, bahut bada bhi giraane ke liye taiyaar hai
 This message was later deleted
 ’’ ullekhneey he ki ‘stratagic cmand’ kaa naaraa he- ‘‘shanti hamaara pesha he
 "it was deleted on social media after being subjected to criticism about this tweet
" sainya bal ne twit ke jariye maafee maangi
 The military force said, "our earlier tweet on New Year's Eve was not appropriate and it does not reflect our values, we apologize
 ham america or sahyogiyon kii suraksha ke prati samarpit hai
 '' in dinon iraq main gadar machaa hua he
 When the US Army returned from Iraq a few years ago, it was expected that a better Iraq would emerge
 lekin teen saal baad iraq gahare sankat ke bavandar main ghira najar aa rahaa he
 And the fact is that the whole world is feeling astonished by seeing this smoldering Iraq
 do bade shaharon par sunni aatankiyon ne kabza jamaa liya he
 The Kurdish army is claiming that the city of Kirkuk has been evacuated
 lekin ek sach ye he ki katleam karte gum rahe aatankiyon ke dar se iraqi sena ke bhi pair ukhd gaye the
 Sunni jihadists in Iraq, under the occupation of many city jihadis, have waged a war to capture the entire country
 or iraqi sena un jihadiyon ko khadedane ke liye jaddojahad kar rahi he
 The jihadis' dangerous intentions are so strong that they have already captured many cities in Iraq
 saath hi katleam karnaa bhi tej kar diya he
 Looking at the pictures of the massacre, many countries of the world have fallen asleep
 khaastaur par hindustan kii
 
 kyonki ye mahaj irakiyon par aatankiyon ke julmon sitam kii kahani nahin bayaan kar rahi
 Rather, all small and big countries of the world are telling the story of making tears of blood
 darasal iraq par kabja karne nikle sunni jihadiyon ne iraq ke kai aise shaharon par kabja jamaa liya he
 Where Iraq's real treasure is crude oil and its refinery
 iraq kaa doosraa sabase bada shahar mosul ab jihadiyon ke kabje main he
 ISIS militants also captured the Baizi and Tikrit cities of Salahuddin province on Monday
 
 And it is only after these cities are captured by the jihadis that the whole world is in a panic because Baizi has Iraq's largest oil refinery
 
 So the world will be hit by inflation
 Everyone knows that after Saudi Arabia, Iraq is the country where oil production is the highest in the world
 or sari duniya main pareshaani kii vajah bhi vahi kaccha tel he
 Because if the jihadis took possession of all the oil in Iraq then the whole world would be hit by inflation
 is vakt iraqi fouj or jihadiyon ke bich baghdad ko bachaane kii jang chhidi hui he
 Sunni jihadis are currently about 55 miles from Baghdad
 beshak jihadiyon kii taadaad iraqi fouj ke mukaable behad kam bataai ja rahi he
 Despite this, the Iraqi army is hardly fighting them
 kyonki khulaasa ye he ki is vakt khun kharabe par utaaru sunni jihadiyon ko saddaam hossain kii bath party ke wo netaa bhi bheetar hi bheetar madad kar rahe hai jo america fouj kii pakad se dur rahe
 Meanwhile, another revelation has made the world sleepless
 jihadiyon ke saath wo british naagarik bhi de rahe hai
 Who had been living in Iraq for a long time
 ye khulaasa kisi or ne nahin 
 In fact, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague did it in his parliament
 is chaunkaane vaale khulaase ke baad ab duniya kii nazaren iraq par lag gai hai
 Because Sunni jihadis have started bloodshed in Iraq in a tremendous way
 alam ye he ki chand mutthi bhar jihadiyon ne kai hajaar nagarikon ko shahar se baahar khaded diya he
 Terrorists of this organization have started appearing from all over Iraq with rocket launchers, mowing tanks and ramming bullets
 saath hi dikhne laga he iraq kii sadakon par maut kaa tandav
 And the bodies of innocent people lying in the wilderness
 kya america or iraan iraq main chal rahe grihayuddh kii vajah se haath milaayenge
 Will the two join each other shoulder to shoulder in jung-e-maidan
 haalanki donon kii dosti vaktiya or halaat kii vajah se ho sakati hai
 But still the news is that America and Iran
 iraq se iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko khadedane ke liye ek duusare se haath mila sakate hai
 The rapidly changing situation in Iraq has brought two enemy countries, America and Iran, together with America and Iran
 agar britain ke videsh sachiv ne ye chaunkaane vaala khulaasa kiya ki da islamic state of iraq and da levent ke aatankwaadiyon kaa saath kuch britain mul ke naagarik de rahe he to ye bhi ek chaunkaane vaala sach he ki jo dushman mulk kabhi ek duusare se sidhe munh baat nahin karte the
 They will now be seen in the battleground to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists
 america ke grih sachiv jon kairi ke mutabik agar iraan is ladaai main america kaa saath detaa he to ye ek vaazib kadam hoga
 By the way, let us tell you that since 1979, the relationship between the two countries has not been good
 jon kairi ke mutabik philhal iesas hi iraq main sabase bada khatra he
 And they will take every necessary step to eliminate that threat
 vaise unhone kaha ki america iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf hawaii hamale ke alaava bhi duusare vikalpon par bhi soch rahaa he
 In fact, the two countries are planning to support each other after the terrorists took possession of another city in Afghanistan
 udhar iraan ke raashtrapati hasan rohani ke kareebi hamid abotalebi ke mutabik america or iraan ek duusare kaa saath dekar iraq kii samasya ko sulajhane kii sthiti main hai
 According to experts, according to them, the US will have to carry out air strikes to drive ISIS terrorists out of Iraq
 philhal america ne baghdad main apane duutavas kii suraksha ke liye 275 sainikon kii ek tukdi bhej rahaa he
 At present, there are only 170 US soldiers in Baghdad
 iske alaava america ne faras kii khadi main apni navy ke yudhpot uassoes jorge dablyoo ech bush ke saath saath uassoes misa varde, uassoes aarle burk, uassoes taxton, uassoes o, ken or uassoes philippine si ko bhi tainaat kar diya he
 However, the Indian government has also expressed concern over the worsening situation in Iraq
 videsh mantralay ke mutabik bharat iraq main aatanki hamalon kii kadi aalochana karata he
 With this, the Indian Foreign Ministry has already told all Indians in Iraq to leave Iraq as soon as possible
 iske liye baghdad main bhartiya ambaisi vatan lautne main unki madad karegi
 But according to sources, 50 Indian nurses are stuck in Mosul and Tikrit, Iraq
 or in donon hi shaharon par iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kaa kabza he
 But will the US seek Iran's help to drive out the terrorists from Iraq, it will become clear in the coming days
 par tab tak iesas ke aatankwaadi iraq kii sarazamiin par or bhi zyaada qatlogarat machaa chuke honge
 Because the situation in Iraq is getting worse and worse with each passing day
 tees saalon se iraq jang kii aag main jhulas rahaa hairaaq main grihayuddh kii aag naa jane kab bujhegi
 Every resident of Iraq is thinking this
 kyonki agar iraq ke itihaas par nazar daale to pichley tees saalon se iraq jang kii hi aag main jhulas rahaa he
 Iraqis first saw war with Iran
 phir desh ko saddaam ke haathon se nijaat dilaane kii jang dekhi or ab iraqi sena or iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ke bich chali jang ke bich pis rahe hai
 Iraq on the world map has been smoldering for the last 24 years, the cities of the city devastated
 hazaron log maut ke munh main samaa gaye, lekin gadar kaa silsilaa phir bhi jari he
 
 or ab isaki aanch duniya tak pahunchane lagi he
 The Iraq war resurfaced on 20 March 2003 in the fire that started in Iraq from 2 August 1990
 ji haa america ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath iraq par ye kahkar hamalaa bolaa ki uske paas jaivik hathiyaar he
 This war continued between Iraq and America for 8 years
 jaise puraa iraq ujaad gaya
 The US destroyed all of Saddam's bases
 saddaam hossain ko faansee de di gai
 Iraq got rid of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, but not relaxed
 pichhali jang main iraq ke andar america kaa saadhe chaar hazaar sainik maare gaye, 32 hazaar viklong ho gaye
 Now Abu Bakral Baghdadi's fury is once again in Iraq; Abu Bakral Baghdadi, who considered Osama bin Laden a mastermind, is terrorizing in the name of enforcing Islamic law
 duniya iraq ke is grih yuddh par chintaa jataa rahi he
 Now the question is, how else will Iraq get rid of the terror of the new Laden
 nigahen america kii taraf tiki hai
 Everywhere in Iraq, blood pressure has turned into a battleground
 chaaron taraf agar kuch nazar aata he to tabaahi or barbaadi ke nishaan
 The sound of bullets and bombs exploding in Iraq's Fijas
 har taraf qatlogarat kaa hi manzar he
 And in the midst of this devastation, some people of India are also trapped there who went to Iraq to earn a living
 unke parivaar waalon kaa aarope he ki jin kapaniyon main wo log kaam kar rahe the wo unhen vahaan chhod kar bhaag gayi hai or ab unako vahaan poochne vaala koi nahin he
 The people of Punjab are shaken by the slaughter and bloodshed in the cities of hindustaniiraq stuck in Iraq
 kisi kaa betaa, kisi ke pita
 Someone's husband is caught in Iraq amid bomb ammo
 amritsar kii rahane vaali gurpinder cor ke bhai apane doston ke saath iraq kii ek company main kaam kar rahe the lekin aatanki hamalon ke bich 41 logon kii koi khabar nahin he 
 The company left these people in the middle of the slaughterhouse and fled to cover the work itself
 tikrit or kareebi ilaakon main kaam kar rahi 46 nurson main se zyaadaatar chaahakar bhi vatan waapas nahi laut saktin 
 She has reached Iraq with a loan of up to two and a half million and this burden has forced her to remain amidst the dangers
 yahaan tak ki red cross ne bhi unki hifaazat se haath khadey kar die hai 
 Marina, a resident of Kottayam, is currently working to give life to the injured in Tikrit's hospital, but today her life itself is in danger and her family here is upset
 fanse hai 2 hajaar se zyada hindustaniiraq main is vakt 2 hajaar se zyada hindustani jahaan tahaan fanse hue hai
 Some lucky ones returned to the country in time, but there is no other place for the rest
 tikrit, mosul, baghdad, basra jaise shaharon main hindustan se gaye zyaadaatar log yaa to aspataalon main kaam kar rahe hai yaa phir construction companiyon main
 Where there are road closures due to encounters and attacks and it is impossible to reach the airport
 dar to is baat kaa he ki agar america ne aatankiyon par atake kiya to halaat haath se nikal jaaenge
 The widows in Bihar and West Bengal have demanded the withdrawal of the alleged statement from BJP MP Hema Malini and said that they had come for Vrindavan not for roam but for 'mukti'

 He said what could be any other place like Vrindavan, Mathura and Varanasi for people who have been separated from worldly life due to various reasons and dedicate themselves to God
 maharashtra nivasee anjana goswami ne kaha ki vrundavan main bhagwaan krishna ke liye bhajan-kirthan kar vidhwaaen santusht mahasoos karti hai
 Patna-born Kaushalya Devi (70) and Aarti Mistry from Odisha objected to Hema Malini's alleged remarks that she was following the traditional 'madhukari'
 unhone bataaya ki madhukaari ek ghar se puraa bhojan grahan nahin karte balki ghar-ghar jaakar thodaa-thodaa bhojan ekatrit karte hai jisase ki ghar waalon ko pareshaani nahin hoti he
 In 2012, Sulabh International intervened to take care of about one thousand widows living in various ashrams after the Supreme Court showed anguish over widows being neglected in Vrindavan
 sulabh international kii upaadhyaksh vineeta verma ne bataaya ki unka sanghathan vrundavan main rah rahi vidhwaaon ko behatar chikitsakeey suvidha or ambulance uplabdh karaane ke saath unamem se prayek ko bhojan or apni dekhbhaal ke liye prati maah do hajaar rupee uplabdh karaata he

 She hoped that during her visit to Kolkata, these women would get an opportunity to share their problems with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee

 Congress workers point out that whenever Gogoi and Sharma go to address a rally together, the Chief Minister prefers to give a speech first, as the crowd begins to disperse immediately after Sharma's speech
 iske baavjood bora kaa maananaa he ki ve jeetenge
 Bora, a student at St
 Stephen's College and a graduate from IIM, Ahmedabad, says, "sharma is a bad man
 main ek acha insaan hum, kyonki maine kabhi kisi kaa khun nahin kiya
 i pay tax main ulpha kaa purv sadsy nahin hum or main ugaahi main kabhi shaamil nahin rahaa
 However, when asked if Sharma has committed any blood or he has ever been a member of ULFA, Bora avoids the answer, but says, "I will not comment on it, but bad men are good
" Man has the opposite
 ''lekin jalukbadi ke matadaata bora ke tarkon se sahamat nahin hai
 Bipul Medhi of Sualkuchi says, "how can you call a minister a bad man?" They have improved our lives, the condition of roads and health centers has improved
 unhone har berozegaar yuva ko rojgaar dilaayaa he
 i got a job based on my talent, no one had to bribe for that
 '' matadaata bora kii shaikshanik uplabdhiyon se bhi prabhavit nahin hai
 His current MLA Sharma in Northeastern Affairs Ph

 And is a student of Cotton College
 sharma ne bora ko chunauti di he ki ve un par koi khaas aropalagakar to dekhen
 Sharma says, "it is very easy to discredit someone
 aakhir mujh par aarope kya hai? mere khilaaf ek bhi aarope nahin he
 He claims that he has given government jobs to 5,000 unemployed youth
 ve kehete hai, ''agali baar shaayad ve mujhe al qaayada kaa sadsy bataaen
 "but Bora is not one to leave them easily
 ve kehete hai, ''vikaas aakhir hua kahaan he? sharma gumraah karne main maahir hai
 There are no electricity in the three villages near Baihata Chariali
 is par sharma hansate hue nahale par dahala maarthe hai, ''mere khilaaf aarope sabit karne ke liye ve mere chunaav kshetra se baahar chale gaye
 Though Bora is aware of Sharma's base, he sees this election as an opportunity for himself
 ve kehete hai, ''hamaare chunaav kshetra main 1

 Neighbors, friends and relatives of those 5,000 employed will be unemployed and feel cheated

 (input bhashaa se)tippaniyan Till now people used to have a sense of reverence for the spiritual ashrams, but the activities going on at the Spiritual Divine University of Farrukhabad are becoming a puzzle for the people
 ashram se ab tak ek agava kishori chhudaayi ja chuki he, 20 se adhik naaballig ladakiyon samet 150 se zyada yuvatiyaan ashram main naarkeey haalat main rah rahi hai or yahaan se sandehaaspad kism kii hajaaron sidi baraamad hone ke baavjood ashram se koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 This is the situation when 64-year-old Baba Virendra Dev Dixit alias Shiv Baba of the ashram, who used to teach teenagers in the name of meditation meditation, has six cases of rape and kidnapping in Farrukhabad district
 khud ko shiv kaa lingarup bataane vaala yah baba philhal police kii giraft se dur he
 The police has filed a case against him and has done its work
 police kii is hilaahvaali kaa nateeja yah niklaa ki ek sitambar ko chaar saal kii gumshuda bacchee ko khojane main ho rahi bevajaah der se gussai bheed ne ashram main tod-phod kar di
 The administration had to deploy police forces to control the situation
 is puure maamle ko jor-shor se uthaane vaali saamaajik sanstha gulabi gang kii commander anjali yadav ne police karrwai ko dikhaava bataaya
 He said, "the police gave the ashram a full opportunity to fix everything
" duusare maamalon main police gupachup chaape maarthi he vahiin search warrant lekar ashram par chapa maarane kii baat pehle hi akhabaaron main chap gai
 Established Nawab Mohammad Khan Bangash and located in the Kanpur division of central Uttar Pradesh named after the then emperor Farrukhshiyar, Farrukhabad is actually a two-city town with Fatehgarh known for potato bumper yields
 yahaan kii posh siktarbagh colony kaa yah ashram is saal 28 agast ko tab charchaa main aayaa jab, banda ke rakesh kumaar ne police se guhaar lagaai ki unki 16 saal kii beti minaa ko ashram main agava kar laayaa gaya he
 When the girl's parents tried to meet the daughter, at first they were not allowed to meet the daughter, and when the ashram agreed to give it to them, the police and family searched for Meena despite the rummage of the ashram
 Could not be found
 police or prashasan ke varisht adhikariyon ke aane par hi ashram waalon ne minaa ko uske mata-pita ke superd kiya
 Yes, during this time, the ugly face of the ashram was definitely revealed in which girls are being kept in basement rooms where they cannot even raise their heads
 28 agast ko ashram se kuch bacchiyon ke baraamad hone kii khabar ke baad kai mata-pita apni gumshuda betiyon ko khojane ashram pahunchane lage
 But the police had already returned the recovered girls to the ashram, so the family's problems increased
 badot kii radhika bhi un badanaseeb maataaon main shaamil thim jinhone apni bacchee ko is ashram main dekha
 But Radhika got the opportunity to enter the ashram only on 1 September, four days after the ashram was busted
 magistrate ke search warrant or police kii maujuudagi main jab radhika ashram pahunchi to ghanton mashkkat ke baavjood ashram ke daravaaje nahin khule
 In such a situation, angry people broke the main door of the ashram and the stuff kept in the yard

 When India Today saw the view of the ashram, neither the CD of it appeared there nor did the grieving mother find her lost daughter
 ashram ke paas rahane vaale gupran shamsi or anya logon ne india today ko bataaya ki beete chaar dinon main yahaan raat main kai baar gadiyon kaa aana-janaa hua
 Many people expressed doubt that it is possible that many girls recovered on 28 August may have been sent to another place
 ashram kaa chappa-chappa chaanane ke baad radhika ne kaha, ''meri beti inhen logon ke paas he or ye use waapas nahin kar rahe hai
 The Ashram will feel sorry for me
 '' ashram ke thik saamne rahane vaale amit manachanda ne kaha ki 1 sitambar ko tadake bhi yahaan se gaadiyaan gai hai
 On the question of why they were handed over to the ashram despite the girls being recovered on 28 August, Superintendent of Police Sagar told India Today, "we had just been informed of the kidnapping of a girl and she was recovered
" baba ke khilaaf is bare main maamla bhi darj kar liya gaya he
 Complaint was not received about the rest so action is not possible
 ye ladkiyaan apane mata-pita kii marji se ashram main hai
 Asked whether the presence of minor girls in Baba's ashram of rape accused is not sufficient reason for the police to take action, Sagar said that a magistrate inquiry has been ordered in the matter
 maamle kii padtaal kar rahe kotwali thana prabharee kaluram dohare ne bataaya, ''koi thos saboot to nahin he, par ashram main sab kuch thik nahin he
 "this is not the first time this ashram is engulfed in controversies
" saamaajik kaaryakarta ravindra singh kehete hai, ''ashram main har ek do saal main koi na koi dukhiyaare mata-pita apni betiyon ko khojate chale aate hai
 Reports have also been filed in many of these cases, but in most of the cases the girls refuse to go home
 '' ek police adhikari ne kaha ki afasar khud pahal nahin karnaa chaahate, vahiin chote pulisavaale ashram kii taraf se lagaae ja rahe jhuthe mukademon se darate hai
 a female police officer said that locks were used everywhere in the ashram
 28 agast ko jab minaa ko chhudaaya gaya tab bhi police ko zyaadaatar maamalon main taale todane padey the or ashram waalon kaa virodh jhelana padaa tha
 Don't know what studies are done in this suffocating world of the ashram
 lekin is padhai kii ek misaal india today ko shivlinga ke sambandh main vahaan stikar par likhe ek vaakya se mili
 This 'sense sentence' was something like that, '' the Father has explained, he is not the extra part of Shankar, he is the next to Shiva

 soshal media par phek news (farji khabaron) kii bharmaar kii vajah se desh ke kai hisson main nirdosh logon kii peet peet kar hatya kar di gai
 The Indian government on Tuesday warned whatsapp for failing to prevent its platform from being misused
 watsape ne buudhvaar ko bharat sarkaar ko bheje jawaab main kaha he ki vah is tarah kii ghatnaon ko lekar ‘bhaybheet’ he
 whatsapp has also assured to take appropriate steps against the 'terror' of fake news and rumors
 bataa den ki mangalvaar ko bharat sarkaar ne apane bayaan main sakht rukh apanaate hue is miseging sarvice ko aagaah kiya tha or gaiyr jimmedaarana rukh apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 In a letter written to the Government of India, whatsapp has said that it is deeply concerned about the safety of the people and has taken steps to fight the terror of fake news and rumors
 watsape ne chitthee main kaha he ki ham hinsa kii in khaufnak ghatnaon ko lekar bhaybheet he or aapane jo ahm mudde uthaae hai un par jawaab main teji se karrwai karnaa chaahate hai
 According to the company, they are working with Indian researchers to better understand the problem
 saath hi aise badlaav kiye ja rahe hai jisase farji sandeshon ko failane se roka ja sake
 In fact, not only whatsapp, but also all platforms of social media have been under tremendous pressure in recent times to not effectively prevent the spread of fake news
 whatsap kii parent company fasebuk pehle hi maan chuki he ki phek news badi chunauti he
 Many steps have also been taken by Facebook
 fasebuk ke siio mark jukerbarg ne is saal 19 janvari ko apni post main aagaah kiya tha, ‘duniya main aaj bahut zyada sansani, galat suchanaaen or dhruvikaran he
 Social media is providing information to people faster than ever before
 or hamane in samasyaon ko sahi tarah se nahin nipta to ham in samasyaon ko or vikaraal hota dekhenge
 Zuckerberg's prediction proved dangerously right in India as well
 bataa den ki soshal plateforms par bacchon ko agava karne kii afvaahon ke chalate ek saal main kam se kam 29 logon ko peet peet kar maar daalaa gaya
 In such a situation, the question is whether the technology companies are not making efforts to meet the challenge of fake news at the level at which they should
 dilli sthit sibar export jitin jain kaa kahana he, ‘agar yahi companiyaan edvertising ke liye internet ke istemaal ke aapke taur tareekon ko sateekta ke saath trek kar sakati hai, aapako baithkon, flite soochnaaon or hotel bookings ke liye apadet karne ke liye aapaki mels ko scan kar sakati hai to wo kyon nahin hinsa, phek news or morphd tasveeron-video se jude contate ko filter kar saktin?’jain kehete hai ki in companiyon kaa mukhya focus un kshetron par rahata he jahaan se wo dhan arjeet kar saken
 In such a situation, can fullproof steps be taken to filter out fake news with the help of technology? The answer lies in the fact that what is fake or fake and what is not, it should be defined and its identity should be confirmed
 fasebuk kii soshal plateform ke newsroom pej par ek short film ‘fite against missinformansion’ inhen sab sawaalon or jigyaasaaon kaa jawaab dhundne kii koshish karti he
 Tissa Lyons, Product Manager at Facebook's New Feed Integrity vertical, says on the challenge, "I believe that this kind of redundancy move would be bad for everyone to try to post what Facebook employees post To be reviewed only
 saath hi unki taraf se ye tay kiya jaae ki post kaa contate jhootha he yaa sachcha
 Then it should be decided accordingly whether the content should be allowed to remain on the platform or not
 ’leones ne kaha, ‘meraa ye bhi maananaa he ki ye bhi bura hoga ki ham kisi tarah kii jimmedaari naa len or het spich or hinsa ko mote taur par vitarit hone den
 It would be like sweeping away from taking enough responsibility
 sahi rasta yaa jawaab in donon ke madhya main he
 
 
 But that's a big middle
 ’news feed intigrity section main hi ek or product manager antonia woodford maanati hai ki agar koi bhraamak photo yaa video aplod karata he to ye bahut zyada chunauti vaala ho jaataa he
 Because they are more visual and it becomes difficult for you to see them
 saath hi ye yakeen naa karnaa ki ye sach nahin he
 Facebook Newsroom lists possible steps to stop fake news on social media
 fasebuk ke newsroom kaa kahana he, ‘is disha main kamyaabi ke liye sabase bada kadam afvaahon kii mil kii tarah kaam karne vaale digital spamers kii pahchaan karnaa he
 An economics also works behind the misleading information spread on Facebook
 agar spamers ko farji kahaniyon par clic karne vaale paryaapt log mil jate hai or wo unki cites par aate hai to wo vahaan dikhaae jane vaale aids ke jariye motaa paisa kamaate hai
 After doing so that there is no scope to make money through such scams, we destroy their intention to spread false news on Facebook
 ham spamers kii ore se saamaanya taur par aajamaae jane vaale hatkandon kii pahchaan kar rahe hai or news feed main us tarah kii stories ke vitaran ko gata rahe hai
 Facebook insists that it is taking action against all such pages and websites which repeatedly share fake news
 aisa karne se unka samoochaa news feed vitaran ghatega
 Forwarding fake messages has become a major problem in India
 soshal media ke plateforms kii uplabdhta ne is samasya ko kai guna or badha diya he
 An update is being worked out by whatsapp, in which the text to be forwarded will have the title that this text is not original
 pakistan ke purv captain javed miyandad kaa maananaa he ki sachin tendulkar ke sanyas lene ke baad logon kii smriti main unki yaaden dhundhlee pad jaaengi, kyonki aise samay main sanyas le rahe hai, jabaki bhartiya cricket team main unki jagah bharne ke liye kuch acchhee pratibhaaen maujuud hai
 Miandad said, "the nature of the cricket lovers of the region is such that if a player tries to prolong his international career, then they forget it soon after he retires
" tendulkar westeindies ke khilaaf guuruuvaar se shuru hone vaale duusare test match ke baad sanyas le lenge
 It will also be his 200th Test match
 miyandad ne kaha ki unhone swayan apana kariyar lanbaa khinchne kii koshish kii thi or yah unke liye acha sabit nahin hua tha
 "I believe Tendulkar should have retired earlier and he is taking a farewell at a time when India has some very talented batsmen who are the current heroes and ideals of the people," he said
 miyandad ne kaha ki tendulkar apane antim match se pehle tamaam tarah ke sammaan or tarifon ke hakdaar hai
 He said, it's good to see
 vah is tarah ke sammaan or aadar kaa hakdaar he kyonki tendulkar ne pichley kai varshon se bhartiya cricket main bahut yogadan diya he or aadhunik yug ke star ballebaajon main unka sthaan sunishchit he
 He said, i would recommend his name as a role model for young cricketers from all cricket playing countries
 ipel ke sizan 10 kaa romaanch sabake sir chadhakar bol rahaa he

 sho main amisha ko badi privlej mili he
 It is that Amisha will be allowed to enter the house
 amisha contestant ke raaj kholti najar aaengi
 It has been seen in the show every season that on the one hand there is someone in the picture, on the other side, there is love between the contestants on the show

 In such a situation, it would not be wrong to say that the contestants of the show need to be vigilant with Amisha
 azamgarh jile main in dinon ek aisa giroh sakriy he, jo hajaaron saal puraani mandiron se beshkeemtee ashtadhaatu kii murtiyon ko mandiron se churaakar uske tukade karke baahar bechney le jaaya karata he
 Earlier, this gang used to sell the entire idol, which was again installed in the temple
 ab jo khel chal rahaa he, usamen puri murti kaa astitv hi khatm ho ja rahaa he
 Even if the idol is caught, a completely fragmented one, which can neither be installed in the temple, nor one can buy abroad as Antique Peace
 pehle aisi murtiyon kii munhmaangi keemat mil jaaya karti thi
 In such a situation, the question arises as to what is the reason, due to which these smugglers are now sending out by cutting or strangling the idols
 iskaa jawaab na to police ke paas he or na hi pakde gaye aparaadhiyon ke paas
 a 3-kg statue of two smugglers caught in Azamgarh in three days costs Rs 3 crore
 aaj pakadi gai teen kilo saat sau gram kii murti kii keemat police ke mutabiq antarrashtriya market main teen karod sattar lakh rupee bataai gai he
 The police have sent all these smugglers to jail after taking legal action
 iske peeche koun-si soch chhipi he, abhi bataanaa mushkil he, jo aasthaa se lekar murti ke astitv ko khatre main daal rahi he
