 chhattisgarh main sarkari shaadiyon ko lekar bavaal machaa hua he
 The BJP government of the state conducts mass marriages every year under the 'mukhyamantri Kanya Vivah Yojana', but this time the screw is stuck on the marriage muhurat
 sarkaar ne vivaah kii tithi 20 july nirdhaarit kii he, jabaki vivaah ke shubh muhoort 17 july ko hi khatm ho jaaenge
 Hence the groom - the brides have refused to take the Bagher Muhurta
 darasal ab oktober maheene main hi vivaah ke muhoort shuru honge
 On the other hand, there will be a code of conduct for the assembly elections in the state, in such a situation, the officers are in a fix about the new date of marriage
 chhattisgarh main 'mukhyamantri kanya vivaah yojana' ne rajya ke sabhi 27 jilon main vivaah yogya var vadhuon kii musiibat badha di he
 The government has fixed the date of marriage as 20 July
 sarkaar ke mahila or bal vikaas vibhaag ne is yojana ke tahat vivaah karne ke icchhuk sabhi ladke or ladakiyon kii kundali bhi taiyaar kar lee he, lekin vivaah kii taarikh ko lekar ladke- ladakiyon ke alaava unke parijanon ne bhi is tithi main shaadi karne se inkaar kar diya he
 The bride and groom refused to marry without a muhurta The Department of Women and Child Development has set a target of 14,800 couples married across the state in the year 2017-18
 vibhaag ne is lakshya ko puraa karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 He also finalized the preparations for the wedding, but at the last moment, when the bride-groom and their families discussed with their pundits about the marriage auspiciousness, their prayers were dashed
 bager muhoort koi bhi shaadi ke liye raji nahin hua
 Rather, the women and child development department bluntly told the boys that if they were married in an inauspicious time, they would have to pay for their marriage, their marital life would also be in a dilemma
 korba jile main sabhi 160 jodon ne vivaah se inkaar kar diya he
 According to Korba's DPO AP Kisapota, pundits and astrologers have forbidden marriage on this date
 isaki jaankaree vibhaag ke bade afasaron ko di gai he
 The government's directive is awaited
 duusari ore is yojana ke tahat vivaah ke liye taiyaari kar rahi sulakshana ne 20 july ke bajaae kisi anya shubh tithi main shaadi karne ke liye mahila evam bal vikaas vibhaag ko patr likhaa he
 In this letter, he has mentioned the tribulations and obstacles caused by marriage in the inauspicious moment
 korba ke hi vikaas sahu ne 20 july ko shaadi karne se saaf inkaar karte hue andeshaa jaahir kiya he ki ashubh muhoort main shaadi baari na pad jaae
 On the other hand, according to Jyotishacharya Priyasharan Tripathi, the auspicious time of marriage is of great importance
 unke anusaar hindu ritirivaaj or vaidic vidhiyon main sadiyon se vivaah ke shubh muhoort kii parampara chali aa rahi he
 He said that a marriage done on inauspicious occasions is not fruitful, because marriage is an important ritual, so the bride and groom should wait for the auspicious moment
 duulhaa-dulhan caperijan bhi sarkaar se narajasirf korba hi nahin balki raigarh, bilaspur, ambikapur, jashpur, surajpur, mungeli, baalod, durg or mahasamund ke 811 jodon ne bhi 20 july ko sarkari shaadi main phere lene se inkaar kar diya he
 Actually, the auspicious time of marriage is only at 10:40 AM in the morning of 17 July, after which the sun will enter the Tropic of Cancer, that means the inauspicious time for marriage will begin
 hindu panchang ke anusaar 23 july se dev shayan kii shuruyaat hogi, dev shayan kii yah avadhi 16 oktober tak prabhaavasheel rahegi iske baad phir vivaah kaa muhoort shuru hoga
 The bride and groom and their family members are also taking a dig at the government that it should be ascendant in the auspicious time
 ye he mukhyamantri kanya vivaah yojanamukhyamantri kanya vivaah yojana ke tahat rajya sarkaar prayek jodon par 60 hajaar tak kii rakam kharch karti he
 Each couple is given a gift table fan, cupboard, dinner set, bed and mattress as a gift
 yahi nahinvivaah samarohame shaamil hone vaale sabhi atithiyon ko muft naashtaa or bhojan bhi miltaa he
 This does not entail any financial burden for the bride and the bride's family for the wedding
 isliye is yojana main shaamil hokar zyaadaatar log inhi mandap main apane bacchon kii shaadi karwaanaa pasand karte hai
 If the marriage did not take place on July 20, it may fall on the officers
 If the sum of the marriage is postponed on July 20, then it may fall on the officers, so the officers are intent on getting married on July 20 itself
 darasal rajya main vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar sitambar maheene ke pehle hafte main hi adarsh aachaar samhita prabhaavasheel ho jaaegi, aise main is tarah ke sarkari aayojan par bhi roak lag jaaegi
 Therefore, even after obtaining the approval of the marriage ceremony, it may lead to disciplinary action against the officers if they do not organize it within the stipulated time
 is dar se mahila or bal vikaas vibhaag kaa amala daraa hua he or iske chalate wo vivaah yogya ladke ladakiyon ko 20 july ko hi shaadi karne ke liye jor de rahaa he
 For this, the officers of the department have also discussed with some of their special pundits
 chhattisgarh main mukhyamantri kanya vivaah yojana kaaphi kaamyaab or lokapriy sabit hui he
 The wedding pavilion, decorated under this scheme, is packed with processions, clowns, guests, officers and politicians

 The politics of the country was still submerged in the Gujarat election result that the Patiala House Court verdict in the 2G scam has added further excitement to the political scenario
 siyasatdanon ke liye bukampiy jatke kii tarah aae is faisle kaa asar 2019 ke aam chunaav tak khinch saktaa he
 The BJP, which came to power at the Center in 2014 after riding anti-corruption waves, has been targeting the Congress over allegations of corruption
 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle dakshin bharat main nae sahyogiyon kii talash main bhatak rahi bijepi ke liye 2-ji kaa khel abhi khatm nahin hua he
 The investigating agencies are going to challenge the decision of the special court in the upper courts
 bijepi ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki sidhe raste yaa duusare tareeke se chaahe jo ho,dravid munnetra kadgambijapi ke liye 2019 ke aam chunaav ke plan kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 On the other hand, the decision of the court has come as a big opportunity for the Congress in the 2G case
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko isaki badi keemat chukaani padi thi
 Now that the court decision has arrived
 party isko bade paimaane par bhunaane kii taiyaari main he
 On Thursday, party leader Kapil Sibal said that all this was a scam of lies
 bijepi ne logon ko bhramit kiya
 The Congress party will now be able to go public in the upcoming elections in a more free manner
 bhale hi jaanch agenciyaan is faisle ko upree court main chunauti den
 But once the message has reached the public, the Congress will not have the burden of 'corrupt' on its head
 party netaaon kaa daawa he ki bijepi ke haath se ek bada chunavi mudda nikal gaya he or congress kii vishwasaneeyata badi he
 However, both parties are eyeing the appeal going to the Upper Court against the trial court's decision
 or 2019 ke chunavi campan ke dauraan is cese main siyaasi taur par jor-aajamaaish puri raftaar main aa sakati he
 Before all these things, it should be kept in mind that in his last visit to Tamil Nadu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi without any prior plan DMK leader M
 karunanidhi kaa haalchaal lene pahunch gaye the
 This was shocking for all leaders, including Stalin
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi siyaasi bisaat par gotiyaan bichaane main maahir hai
 BJP is looking to get a better ally in Tamil Nadu
 jayalalita ke samay annadramuk bijepi kii sahyogi thi, lekin ammaa kii maut ke baad annadramuk main vibhaajan or uthapatak ke chalate bijepi ko unka saath raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Here, the DMK is eyeing to strengthen itself and return to power in Tamil Nadu
 tu-ji cese main apane netaaon ke bari hone ke baad dramuk ke liye yah badi jeet kii tarah he
 After the court's decision, the way fireworks broke out at the house of Stalin and his leaders shows the party's enthusiasm
 diemke ab zyada utsaah se chunavi ladaaiyon main utregi
 However, the Congress is not going to give up easily with the DMK ally in the UPA government
 court ke faisle ke baad congress netaaon ne kanimojhi kaa swaagat kiya, to kanimojhi ne bhi purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh se milane kaa samay maanga
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi spoke to Kanimozhi and said that this is a very important time for both the parties
 diemke ab tu-ji ke daag se khud ko mukt mahasoos kar rahi he to bikhar chuki annadramuk ke mukaable loksabhaa chunaavon main apane liye behatar maukey bhi mahasoos kar rahi he
 However, it is in the future that the DMK takes the path after the two-g decision
 kya wo bhartiya raajnneeti main 'rhite turn' legi yaa apane puraane sahyogi ke saath aage badhegi

 com / iuysvq3di4 — Dushyant Chautala B- (@dchautala) January 7, 2018 The RTI revealed that BJP mps were also paid to perform at the festival
 hema malini ko 20 lakh or manoj tiwari ko 10 lakh rupee die gaye the
 Chautala alleged that PM Modi says that his government maintains zero tolerance against corruption
 lekin unke saansadon ko ek dharmik kaaryakramon ke liye bhi itnaa paisa diya ja rahaa he
 He told that the Chautala and Hooda government had organized this festival for a few lakh rupees, but the Khattar government has spent crores on it
 unhone kaha ki ham is maamle main kaig se jaanch ke liye apil karenge
 According to RTI, one crore rupees was spent in repairing the Brahma Sarovar, although in 2016 only 38 lakh rupees had already been spent for the same work
 chautaala ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ne apane chaahane waalon ko hi aword diya he
 However, in this case Anil Vij, a minister in the state government, said that the Geeta Mahotsav was a spectacular event
 agar is maamle main koi gadabadi dikhaai padati he to ham jaanch karenge or doshi adhikariyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai bhi karenge
 The Rajya Sabha's Privileges Committee has asked the Delhi Police to seriously pursue the ongoing legal action against the accused in the case of phone tapping of former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley so that the accused can be punished
 visheshadhikaar samiti ne dilli police ko cese kii pragati ke bare main samiti ko avgat karaane ko kaha he
 This is the case of 2013 when Arun Jaitley was the leader of BJP in Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha kii visheshadhikaar samiti ne rajyasabha main pesh apni report main kaha ki saansadon ke phone kol record ko avaidh tareeke se lenaa visheshadhikaar kaa hanan he agar is vajah se saansad ke kaam-kaaj main baadha aati he
 Explain that the committee had not in its previous report called the breach of privilege to illegally obtain call data records, but the report was then opposed by many mps
 iske baad visheshadhikaar samiti ne is report ko phir se taiyaar kiya
 The panel heard the opinion of the Commissioner of Delhi Police and also took the opinion of the Attorney General on the matter
 is maamle kii jaanch karne ke baad panel is raay par pahunchi ki yadi sansad ke maujuuda sadasyon ke phone kol record ko avaidh tareeke se hasil karne par unke sansadeey kaam-kaaj main koi baadha pahunchati he to ise visheshadhikaar kaa hanan mana jayega
 Also, this step will be considered a violation of privacy under criminal law
 bataa den ki rajyasabha ke kuch sadasyon dwaara 2013 main arun jetali ke phone kii monitering or servilans ke maamle main visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice diya gaya tha
 The Privileges Committee of the Rajya Sabha has submitted its report in this case and has asked the Delhi Police to follow the case in court with all seriousness

 The court, like his father Asaram, convicted son Narayan Sai with two sisters from Surat in the rape case
 is maamle main adaalat ne use umrakaid kii sajaa sunai he
 Also, he has been fined Rs one lakh
 yani baap bete donon kii puri umr kaid kar lee gai he
 At times in luxurious ashrams, Asaram and Narayan Sai used to give long discourses of morality to the devotees
 asaram manch par naachata tha to uske saath uskaa betaa narayan sai bhi naach naachakar bhakton ke saamne apni lila kaa paakhand rachataa tha
 But what did anyone know that the ashram that devotees consider a temple and the Asaram and Narayan Sai that they consider God
 wo guru nahin guru ghantal hai
 In the nearly 11-year-old case, the Sessions court in Surat booked Narayan Sai in the case of rape with two sisters
 jis maamle main court ne faisla sunaaya he
 He is joined by two sisters from Surat
 in bahanon ne narayan sai par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The police had registered a case against Narayan Sai and Asaram on the basis of the statements of the victim sisters and evidence from the location
 police ko narayan sai ko sajaa dilaane ke liye kaaphi mashkkat kerani badi
 The rape victim's younger sister had said in her statement to be concrete evidence against Narayan Sai
 police ne har us lokation kii padtaal kii
 Which was mentioned by the victim girl in her complaint
 jabaki badi bahan ne asaram ke khilaaf maamla darj karavaaya tha
 a case is going on in the Gandhinagar court against Asaram for raping two sisters
 narayan sai ke khilaaf court ab tak 53 gavaahon ke bayaan darj kar chuki he, jisamen kai ahm gavaah bhi hai
 Who saw Narayan Sai making girls fall prey to their lust
 yaa phir is ghinaune kaam main aropiyon kii madad kii thi
 But later all these became witnesses
 bhakton kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke maamle main agar baap asaram ek numberi tha
 So his son was ten
 narayan sai par jaise hi rape ke maamle main exiaar darj hui
 In the same way, it was underground
 police ko wo lambey vakt tak chakma detaa rahaa
 During this time, he constantly misled the police by changing his hideout
 us vakt surat ke police kamishnar rakesh asthana ne narayan sai ko giraftaar karne ke liye 58 alag-alag timen banaai thi or narayan sai ko khojane ke liye puri takat jhonk di thi
 Narayan Sai was arrested near the haryana-delhi border in December 2013, nearly two months after the rape case was registered
 giraftaar ke vakt narayan sai ne sikh vyakti kaa bhesh dhar rakhaa tha
 Narayan Sai, like the father, had woven the illusion of hypocrisy
 wo asaram ke failaae mayajaal main logon ko fansaakar unhen apni havas kaa shikaar banaata tha
 Narayan Sai knew the act of Asaram
 or asaram bhi jaanata tha ki uskaa betaa uske ashram main kya gul khilaa rahaa he
 Even after coming under the grip of law, Narayan Sai never eluded his antics
 jail main rahete hue usne police karmchaaree ko 13 karod rupee kii rishwat dene kii bhi kathith koshish kii thi
 However, Narayan Sai is out on bail in this case
 lekin rape ke maamle main court main sabit ho gaya ki asaram kii tarah narayan sai bhi balaatkaari he or apane pita kii tarah hi shaatir bhi he

 bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha party line se itar apane khule or bebaak bayanon ke liye jane jate hai
 Whether it is about Bihar elections or Kanhaiya Kumar in JNU case
 'bihari babu' ke vichaar se party ke ek dhade ko hameshaa pareshaani rahi he or sinha khud is baat ko sweekaar karte hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, he said that if his resignation helps the party, then he is also ready for it
 shatrughna sinhane ek baar phir doharaaya ki bijepi unki pehali or aakhri party he
 He says, 'whatever i feel is right, i definitely say
 yahi kaaran he ki maine kanhaiya kaa samarthan kiya
 'support on the basis of humanity and truth', he says, 'first of all, let me make it clear that BJP is my first and last party
 party kaa kaddavar kaaryakarta or netaa hone ke naate mujhe bharat ke kanoon, bharat ke samvidhan or hamaare pradhanmantri narendra modi main purna vishwaas he
 Now i would like to say that what i tweeted about Kanhaiya has been done on the basis of humanity and truth
 meraa aadhaar hai court kaa wo faisla he, jisamen kanhaiya ko bel mili he
 "I don't even know Kanhaiya", said Shatrughan Sinha, "as far as Kanhaiya is concerned, i don't even know him
 kabhi mila bhi nahin
 But what i saw, read and heard, Rahul Gandhi said something similar
 usamen kahin kisi kism kaa anti neshnal yaa gaiyr sanvaidhanik baat nahin suni gai
 '' Tweet was in English may not be understood '' in Bihar, BJP leaders have demanded Sinha's resignation
 is par vah kahat hai, 'bihar bijepi ke logon ne hamaare istife kii maang kii he to iske teen kaaran ho sakate hai
 They may not know English properly, because my tweet was in English
 doosraa kaaran ye ho saktaa he ki unhone twit ko samajha nahin or teesri baat ye ho sakati he ki khisian billi khambha noche vaali kahawat ko charitaarth kar rahe hai
 "shotgun" said, "those people who have reached the stage of leaving the party themselves, who are responsible for defeating such a shameful defeat of BJP, they are asking for my resignation
 jo aadmi itane varshon se party main he, jisane aaj tak party ke khilaaf koi baat nahin kii, jisane aaj tak lakshmana rekha kaa ulanghan nahin kiya, us bihari babu kaa istipha maangane se wo thodaa atension divert karnaa chaahate hai
 'kanhaiya's body language is very good', BJP MP praised Kanhaiya's speech and body language of JNU students' union
 unhone kaha, 'maine suna he ki logon ne kanhaiya ke bhaashan kii tarif kii he, lekin ek kalakaar ke naate agar kahuun to mujhe uski body language badi acchhee lagi
 If there is energy in it, if it is used properly then there is tremendous confidence in it
 'unhone aage kaha, 'main aaj tak par rajdeep saradesai ke saath uskaa saakshaatkaar dekh rahaa tha
 He answered the questions quite well
 usne aadar ke saath, sammaan ke saath or gaharaai ke saath kahi koi fumbal yaa ghabrahat nahin, ek paripakv vaktaa or vyakti kii tarah baat rakhi
 We would like to make Bihar and the country proud by doing positive work
 ''deshadrohi or deshbhakt par faisla adaalat karegi'shanivaar ko amit shah ne mathura main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 On this, Shatrughan Sinha said, 'our national president has said something, so now anything has to be raised to dispute it
 lekin duusari baat ye ki maamla ab nyaayal ke paas he or koun deshadrohi he or koun nahin he, kya sach he or kya sach nahin he, iskaa faisla police, aap yaa ham nahin karenge
 The court will decide this
 jab tak ye maamla adaalat main hai ham sabko is par chup rahanaa chahie
 Expressing his displeasure towards the people of the party, BJP said, 'mein kasoor kya' logon ne mere khilaaf bolnaa shuru kiya, isliye maine kuch twit kiye
 Otherwise i have no position, no position
 mujhe ye bhi nahin pataa ki mai agali neshnal agxcutive me rahoonga yaa nahin rahoonga
 i have no complaints for this
 main isliye party main nahin aayaa tha
 'he further said,' One day i will leave the party or the party will expel me
 kyon bhai meraa kasoor kya he
 What have i done, in all the things i have said till date, nothing is against the party
 aap gaur karenge to paaenge ki jo bhi baaten maine kahi wo party ke hit main kahi hai
 i have said that to Bihar and the country
 meri deshbhakti par yaa mathrubhumi ke prati meraa jo pyaar he us par koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa, main apni party kaa bahut vafaadaar aadmi hum
 BJP is my first and last party
 ''mere istife se bhala hota he to main taiyaar'bihar chunaav main bijepi kii ore se bataur netaa pramukhataa nahin dene ke kaaran naaraaz chal rahe sinha ne kaha, meri tamaam koshish ke baavjood logon ne mujhe bihar chunaav main nahin bulaane kii thaanee, iskaa itnaa bada khamiyaja unhe bhugatna padaa ki shaayad aaajeevan nahin bhul paaenge
 But don't i feel sad about it? ham jiti hui baaji haar gaye
 Just because of the aspirations of some people
 unheen main se kuch logon ne mere istife tak kii baat kar lee
 If my resignation helps the party, then i am standing before you
 'wo raja ham rank'paanch rajyon main chunaav ke babat amit shah kii nai team main khud ke shaamil hone ke sawaal par shatrughna ne kaha, 'wo raja hai ham rank hai
 Decide that ham maang nahin sakate, wo daata hai or daata ke teen lakshan hote hai
 Either give it, or give it, or take it back
 amitabh bachchan ne bhi kaha tha ki wo raja, ham rank hai

 All opinions and arguments are being given in the media about Sridevi's death
 lekin abhi tak isaki koi aadhikarik pushti nahin hui he ki shridevi kii maut heart atake se hi hui yaa kisi or vajah se
 Now only after the post mortem report comes, it will be clear how Sridevi died

 rashtriya janata dal (rajd) pramukh lalu prasad yadav bihar main apni rajnatik jameen bachaane kii koshish main jute gaye hai
 After a prolonged silence as she was completely wiped out in the November 2010 Assembly elections, Lalu embarked on the Farbis Ganj Yatra, reaching Araria district on 3 September in support of the June 3 police firing victims
 bhajanpura gaanv main ek vyavsaayik pratishthan kaa virodh kar rahe musalamaanon ke ek samooh par police golibari main chaar logon kii maut ho gai thi, jinamein ek shishu or ek garbhvatee mahila bhi thi
 Two days after the visit of Farbis Ganj, Lalu also visited a hospital in Nalanda, home district of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, where he inquired about the condition of a backward caste woman who was being treated for her wounds, which was beaten by some overbearing people in the village
 Was
 lalu ne pidaton kii aarthik madad karte hue bhajanpura main mritkon ke parivaar ko ek-ek lakh ru

 die
 In his golden days, Lalu used to be the magician of the general public, who joined him directly and formed a relationship with the public wherever he went
 november, 2005 main nitish ne jab unhen satta se bedakhal kar diya tha, uske kareeb chah saal baad lagata he unki hekdi khatm ho chuki he or unke vyaktitv kendrit prachaar kaa samay khatm ho gaya lagata he, shaayad isliye ve ab aise muddon par daanv laga rahe hai jo janata ko jagaa saken
 The good news for Lalu is that there is no dearth of issues in Bihar
 lekin buree khabar yah he ki lalu kii vah saakh nahin rah gai he, jiske bharose ve koi bada jan andolan chalaa saken
 At the time of the 2010 assembly elections, he failed to raise issues related to the general public in the state, such as the state's poor excise policy
 yahaan tak ki ab bhi bhajanpura ke peediton tak pahunchane main unhen teen maheene lag gaye jabaki congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi 1 july ko hi unka haalchaal lene pahunch gaye the
 Little wonder that Nitish took a jibe at Lalu's attempt and said, "it seems, he has been sleeping very late
" ''sitambar ke shuru main unke do dauron se lagata he ki ve ek baar phir apana janaadhar waapas paane kii kavayad main jute gaye hai

 The plane of Dhaka landed in Delhi and Sonu's parents got the biggest happiness of life even before Eid

 Sonsookai, living in a shelter home in Bangladesh, had been waiting for years to visit her parents

 After this, the team of officers reached the residence of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with Sonu, where Sonu touched Sushma Swaraj's feet and Sushma hugged Sonu
 uske mata-pita ne bhi videsh mantri kaa aabhaar jataayaa
 Significantly, Sonu went missing while playing outside his home in Delhi 6 years ago

 Noted film director Anurag Kashyap, who gave Bollywood films out of the box, became part of Aaj Tak's Literature Festival 'sahitya Aaj Tak' to speak on literature and cinema
 anuraag kashyap ne is festival ke satr 'nayaa cinema nai jubaan' main cinema or sahitya par apane tajurbe se jude kai dilachasp vichaar rakhe
 We cannot always be a buffoon, literature and cinema are the same as those who do not give gold, remembering the beginning of their filmmaking career, Anurag Kashyap said that there was a lot of childlessness in the film making in the early stages
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa tha ki 'daaud ibrahim' ko film main daaud ibrahim nahin bol sakate, 'shivasena' ko shivasena nahin bol sakate the
 All i know is that i have to say the same thing on my mind
 baad main pataa chalaa ki cinema main ye bhi ek ladaai he
 On the question asked about Anurag's separate test for films, he said, "in our society the notion has been settled in the mind that what distracts you is wrong
" filmon ko lekar bhi yahi ronaa he
 i believe that makes you think, Son Na De is the same literature and it is the same cinema
 ham hameshaa bhaand nahin ho sakate ki har vakt bas anterten hi karte rahen
 In childhood, when asked questions, he was scolded, so now in films, he is fond of writing anonymously, but Anurag told that when he writes, he writes as if it means to say that what comes to mind is He goes on writing
 anuraag ne kaha ki jab unhone pehali baar kavita likhi thi tab vah skool main the or skool ne unki kavita ko magazine main chhapane se manaa kar diya tha
 The reason given was that his writing is dark
 is kavita ko padhane ke baad anuraag ke gharavaalon ko bulaakar kaha gaya ki ye kya likhata he bahut dark likhata he
 In this way, since childhood, Anurag has been fond of telling similar things and ideas that no one wants to talk about
 anuraag ne bataaya ki ham log aise maahaul main paley-bade hai jahaan agar sex yaa dharm par koi sawaal puch liya jaae to daant pad jaati thi ki kahaan suna kahaan se ye sab sikh rahe ho
 i got a similar atmosphere
 lekin ab main apni filmon ke jariye logon se sawaal karata hum
 Because it is not a film for me that leaves no question or thought in the mind of people
 cinema main 10% sahitya he baaki mastaram hi heanurag kashyapane is baat par jor dete hue kaha ki maujuuda daur main cinema ne sahitya kii jagah le lee he lekin filmon main sahitya to sirf 10 percent hi najar aata he baaki to mastaram he
 Anurag said, 'nowadays reading of literature has reduced
 vijual media chalan main he or cinema sahitya kii jagah le rahaa he
 So cinema has to take responsibility of literature
 'anuraag ne yah bhi kaha ki jo simit he wo sahitya nahin use vah sahitya ke rup main pard hi nahin sakate kyonki jise shabdon ke daayre main baandh diya jaae wo kaisaa sahitya? anuraag bole, 'main kashinath ko bahut bada sahityakar maanata hum or aise bhi bahut bade sahityakar hai jo chhapate hi nahin hai
 Every person has his own way of telling his own talk
 a standup comedian also speaks what he says, i also consider him a writer
 ' pakistan ke pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ne kaha he ki ham bharat ke saath madhur sambandh kaayam karnaa chaahate hai
 Gilani said that we request other countries to ask India to normalize the situation
 gilaani ne kaha ki ham nahin chaahate ki hamaari zamin kaa istemaal kisi bhi tarah ke aatankwaad ke liye kiya jaae, yah hamaari jimmedaari he
 He said that non-governmental parties will not be allowed to succeed in this matter
 gilaani ne kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh par janata kaa jabardast dabaav he, nahin to hamaare bich achche sambandh viksit ho gaye the

 From this seat, RJD President Lalu Prasad's elder daughter Misa Bharti is in the fray

 After meeting with his supporters, Ramkripal said that on the opinion of the supporters, he has decided to contest from Pataliputra Lok Sabha constituency

 rajd ne lalu prasad kii beti misa bharti ko patliputra se apana ummidavaar banaaya he, jisase ramkripal naaraaz ho gaye hai
 With this announcement by Ramkripal, it is believed that Ramkripal, who is considered to be Lalu's loyal and closest and Misa Bharti, who will enter politics for the first time as a Lok Sabha candidate, will be face to face in the Pataliputra parliamentary constituency
 gauratlab he ki tikat se vanchit hone ke baad naaraaz ramkripal dilli chale gaye the jahaan misa unke awaas par jaakar unki naaraazgi dur karne ke liye pahunchi thim
 She had also said that day that if Ramkripal is upset due to the Pataliputra seat, she will not contest from there herself
 lekin paanch ghante intjaar ke baad bhi donon kii mulaakaat nahin ho saki thi

 abhishek bachchan or aishwarya raay bachchan ke bich manmutav kii khabaren aksar aati rahati hai
 At the time of the release of 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil', there was a news that Abhishek is not happy with Aishwarya's hot scenes in the film
 haalanki in khabaron ne jald hi dam tod diya tha
 Aishwarya is not on Facebook, what is the reason for Abhishek? Now, according to the report of 'amar Ujala', the distance has come once again due to Aradhya
 darasal abhishek chaahate hai ki aradhya abhi se bollywood main child artist ke taur par kaam karnaa shuru kar den, taaki unhen acting kaa abhi se anubhav hone lage
 But Aishwarya is not happy with Abhishek's decision
 wo apni beti ko limlite se dur rakhana chaahatin hai
 Because of this, there has been tension between the two
 abhishek bachchan ne red karpet par aishwarya raay se kiya bura bartaav, dekhen videohalanki in khabaron par abhi tak kisi ne coment nahin kiya he lekin is baat par vishwaas karnaa thodaa mushkil hi ho rahaa he
 Many political parties have raised their voice on evms in the country and alleged that evms can be tampered with, the Election Commission has consistently denied these allegations
 chunaav ayog kaa daawa he ki iviem se chhedchhad kii hi nahin ja sakati he
 But the accusing parties did not listen to the Election Commission
 vahiin dilli kii aam aadmi party ne vidhansabha main iviem jaisi ek mashin ko laakar chhedchhad dikhaane kii koshish kii
 They claim that they have hackers who will prove that evms can be hacked or it can get desired results
 vahiin, in sab aaropon ke bich chunaav ayog ne iviem main chhedchhad sabit karne ke liye raajnneetik dalon ko khuli chunauti pesh kii he
 The Election Commission has made it clear that these challenges are subject to certain conditions
 aaie dekhen kya hai ye sharten
 
 
 Political parties may use the machines used in the recent assembly elections but foreign experts are prohibited from participating in it
 yah chunauti sirf rashtriya or rajya partiyon ke liye khuli hogi jinhone paanch rajyon - uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, manipur, goa or punjab main hua chunaav ladaa tha
 They will not be allowed to change evm's motherboard and take it home to prove the disturbance at a later date
 ayog ne kaha ki badali hui chip ke saath iviem chunaav ayog kii iviem nahin hogi, balki us jaisi dikhegi
 Participants (three members from each party) will be allowed to investigate the evms so that they can check the circuit, chip and motherboard
 paanch rajyon kii vidhansabha siton se unki pansad kii chaar iviem unhen di jaaengi
 The challenge will be decided mainly by the members of the Commission's Technical Expert Committee to ensure that the rules are followed and that the machines are not damaged
 chunauti kareeb 4-5din chalegi, jo pratibhaagiyon kii sankhya par nirbhar he
 The last date to apply for this is 26 May
 har pratibhaagi samooh ko mashin hack karne ke liye chaar ghante kaa vakt diya jayega
 The challenge of the year 2009 was organized in Vigyan Bhawan but this time its venue will be Election House which is the headquarters of the Commission
 jaidi ne kaha ki yah do bhaagon main hoga
 Under the first part, the parties have to prove that the evms used in the assembly elections in five states in favor of a particular candidate or party were tampered with and this was done by altering the results recorded in the machine
 vahiin, chunauti ke duusare bhaag ke tahat pratibhaagiyon ko yah sabit karnaa hoga ki in iviem main matdaan ke din yaa us din ke pehle gadabadi kii gai thi
 At the same time, amid all these allegations, the Election Commission has presented an open challenge to political parties to prove tampering in evms
 chunaav ayog ne saaf kar diya he ki yah chunauti kuch sharton ke saath hai
 Let us see what are these conditions
 
 
 raajnneetik partiyaan haalia vidhansabha chunaav main istemaal kii gai mashiinon kaa istemaal kar sakati hai lekin videshi visheshgyon ke isamen bhaag lene kii pabandi he
 The challenge will be open only to national and state parties who contested elections in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa and Punjab
 unhen iviem kii madraboard badalane or gadabadi ko baad kii taarikh main sabit karne ke liye use ghar le jane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 The commission said that the EVM with the changed chip will not be the EVM of the Election Commission, but will look like that
 pratibhaagiyon (har party se teen sadsy) ko iviem kii padtaal kii ijaajat hogi taaki ve circuit, chip or madraboard kii jaanch kar sake
 Four evms of his choice will be given to him from the assembly seats of five states
 chunauti ke bare main faisla mukhya rup se ayog kii takneekee visheshgy samiti ke sadsy karenge taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki niyamon kaa paalan ho or mashine kshatigrast naa ho
 The challenge will run for about 4-5 days, depending on the number of participants
 iske liye aavedan karne kii aakhri taarikh 26 may he
 Each participant group will be given four hours to hack the machine
 varsh 2009 kii chunauti kaa aayojan vigyaan bhawan main hua tha lekin is baar iskaa aayojan sthal nirvachan sadan hoga jo ayog kaa mukhyalay he
 Zaidi said that it would be in two parts
 pehle bhaag ke tahat partiyon ko yah sabit karnaa hoga ki kisi khaas ummidavaar yaa party ke paksh main paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav main istemaal kii gai iviem se chhedchhad hui thi or mashin main darj nateezon main badlaav kar aisa kiya gaya tha
 At the same time, under the second part of the challenge, the participants will have to prove that there was a mess in these evms on or before the day of polling
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko bahu-brands khudara kaarobaar (retail) main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) kii sarkari niti kii pushti kii or kaha ki ek niti ke rup main isamen koi sanvaidhanik yaa vaidhanik durbalata nahin he
 Justice R
 em
 The bench headed by Lodha rejected the plea challenging FDI in multi-brand retail, saying, 'this court does not interfere in matters affecting policy as long as the policy is unconstitutional, against statutory provisions, arbitrary Do not be absurd or misuse of power
 'court ne kaha ki bahu-brands retail main epadiai kii ijaajat dene vaali vivaadit niti main seemaa se baahar kuch bhi kiye jane kaa koi dosha nahin he or ise di gai chunauti vaazib nahin he
 Advocate M
 el
 The policy was challenged by Sharma
 unhone kaha tha ki do press note jari kar niti sweekaar kii gai thi or retail main epadiai ko niyamit karne vaale sambhddha praavdhaanon or niyamavaliyon main sanshodhan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Former Union Minister Arun Shourie on Sunday said in support of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial contender that he is the only capable candidate for the post in the BJP
 shouri ne ek samaaroh se itar kaha, ‘yah tay baat he or is samay party main modi hi pradhanmantri pad ke sakasham daavedaar hai
 He said that many party workers are supported with Modi
 bihar kii raajnneeti main hameshaa kuch na kuch halchal hoti rahati he
 This time the political movement is within JDU and at its center is strategist and JDU National Vice President Prashant Kishore
 beete kuch samay se apane bayanon or gatividhiyon kii vajah se prashanth kishor media kii surkhiyon main hai
 Prashant Kishore is making such statements, which can prove to be a problem for JDU in the coming elections and the opposition can take advantage of it politically
 pradhanmantri, mukhyamantri banane vaale bayaan se lekarajadayu ko bhaajapa ke saath na jane kii baat, jaise prashanth kishor ke bayaan se jadyu naaraaz najar aa rahi he
 Sources are saying that there is a lot of resentment about Prashant Kishore in JDU and that he is also shying away from Prashant Kishore's statements with a suppressed tongue
 prashanth kishor ke kuch bayaan se aisa lag rahaa he ki unamem or nitish kumaar main shaayad sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 If you look at the recent developments, then it seems that both JDU and Prashant Kishore are running in different streams
 begusarai ke shahid pintu singh ko jab sarkaar or party kii ore se koi shradhanjali dene nahin gaya, tab prashanth kishor ne sarkaar or party kii ore se maafee maangi
 Then when he went to the program with the youth in Muzaffarpur, he said that he has made the Prime Minister and Chief Minister in the country, now he will make the youth also like mps, mlas
 iske baad unka ek or bayaan viral ho rahaa he jisamen vah kah rahe hai ki nitish kumaar ko bijepi ke saath gathbandhan nahin karnaa chahie
 Actually, these are some recent statements by Prashant Kumar, from which JDU is cutting edge
 in bayanon kii vajah se jadyu main prashanth kishor ko lekar bhi kaaphi naaraazgi he
 JDU National Vice President Prashant Kishore is in the headlines in Bihar politics these days
 apane bayaan se prashanth kishor kaaphi chhaae hue hai
 Recently, during a program with youth in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, Prashant Kishore made a statement that he has helped in becoming PM and CM so far, he will now help the youth of Bihar to become MP-MLA, Chief and Ward
 prashanth kishor ke saansad-vidhayak banane vaale bayaan ne unheen ke party ke netaaon ko asahaj kar diya he
 JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar has said that his party's role model is Nitish Kumar
 bataur niraj kumaar kisi ko emele-empi bananaa janata ke haath me hai
 He has said that his party does not agree with this statement
 niraj kumaar ne kaha ki party sirf maahaul banaati he, netaa bananaa to janata ke haath main he
 He said that he works well under the leadership of Nitish Kumar
 ek intervyuu main prashanth kumaar ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ko mahagathbandhan se naata todane ke baad unhen bijepi ke saath na jaakar fresh mandet yani nae janadesh ke liye dobaaraa chunaav main janaa chahie tha
 This statement of Prashant Kishore becomes very important because Prashant Kishore is not only the jdu's national vice president but he is also considered very close to Nitish Kumar
 aisi ummid kii ja rahi he ki vipaksh prashanth kishor ke is bayaan ko bhunaane kii koshish kar saktaa he or chunaav main iskaa mylej bhi
 On March 3, Prashant Kishore also appeared at the NDA rally in Patna
 endie kii raily main prashanth kishor kii koi bhoomika nahin thi or us din vah patna main bhi maujuud nahin the
 If sources are to be believed, JD (U) was not given any responsibility for the rally
 haalanki, agle din party kii baithak main aae
 The reason for his distance from the BJP was also clear from his statement that he clarified in the party meeting that the party he is talking to from Shiv Sena is doing it only for Nitish Kumar
 3 march ko hi patna main begusarai se shahid pintu singh ko shradhanjali dene gaye jadyu yaa sarkaar kii ore se koi bhi netaa nahin gaya
 The government and the party faced criticism about this
 aalochanaon ko dekh prashanth kishor ne khud iske liye maafee maangi thi
 He apologized to his Twitter account that he made a mistake
 
 
 
 and the follow-up pic
 twitter
 com / copdgebsv3 However, later CM Nitish Kumar himself went to pay tribute to Shaheed Pintu Singh
 begusarai ke dhyanchakki gaanv main shahid pintu singh ko shradhanjali dene gaye
 Prashant Kishore shared it on his Twitter account and wrote - and the followup
 yani prashanth kumaar ke twit se yah saaf he ki vah yah bataane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki unke twit ke baad hi nitish kumaar shahid pintu singh ko shradhanjali dene unke ghar gaye
 Many JDU leaders are angry with Prashant Kishore after this tweet
 sutron kii maane to jadyu netaaon main prashanth kishor ke khilaaf asantosh gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Many JDU leaders are assuming that Prashant Kishore is starting to consider himself bigger than the party
 vah party se bhi apane aap ko bada bananaa chaahate hai
 Some JDU leaders have started to believe that Prashant Kishore is doing his branding instead of working as a party
 party main naaraazgi is baat ko lekar bhi he ki vah apane aap ko jadyu main number tu maanate hai
 To fulfill the dreams, it is very important that there is no dearth of effort
 aapaki har koshish aapako apane sapane ke ek kadam paas pahunchaayegi
 a similar message has been given in this new advertisement of Turkish Airlines
 is vigyaapan main kuch chote-chote bachche apane gaanv ke maidan ke upar se har roj ek hawaii jahaaj ko udata dekhte hai
 Children wish that airplanes would one day land in their ground
 hawaii jahaaj ko apane gaanv ke maidan main utaarne ke liye ye bachche apni buddhi se kuch maasoom koshishen karte hai
 In their thinking, these children draw airport-like designs in that dusty ground, creating a small runway
 yahi nahin, us ranvaper lite bhi lagaate hai
 And then points to the airplane passing above that it lands
 in bacchon kii maasoom koshishon ko dekhakar aap bhi bina muskuraae nahin rah paaenge
 See how this advertisement changes the children's dream
 ye vigyaapan apko bhi apane sapanom kii ore ek kadam badhaane ke liye jarur prerit karegaa
