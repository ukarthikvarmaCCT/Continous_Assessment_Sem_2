 The biggest irony of employment policy in the country is that during the last decade, the rate of economic growth in the country has been steadily accelerating and employment figures are going into critical condition
 jahaan vaishvik str par arthshaastri ise jobles growth kah rahe hai, rojgaar kii samasya modi sarkaar ke liye sabase badi chunauti banakar khadi he
 In such a situation, it is a result of the government's impatience that in a recent interview, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that when the youth on the roadside are earning 200 rupees a day by selling pakoras, then it needs to be called employment generation

 Significantly, during the last one and a half decade, where the economy is growing at more than 7 percent, employment figures are 2 during this period
 87 fisadi ke dar se ludhakkar 1 fisadi se bhi kam ke str par pahunch gaya he
 Modi government's promise of one crore jobs ended at Pakoda-paan, where Narayan Murthy gave the job creation for the central government, while appealing to the businessmen of the country to prepare more and more youth for jobs in the coming decade
 It is important that they give the highest importance to investment and training in new age technology
 narayanamurthi ne daawa kiya ki beete deb dashak ke dauraan infosis kii safalataa kaa sabase bada raaj yahi he ki usne yuvaaon kii training ko sarvaadhik mahatv diya or maujuuda samay main company ke paas 14 hajaar yuvaaon ko pratidin training dene kii chhamata maujuud he

 Earlier on Monday, in a letter to Hazare, Hazare alleged that a joint campaign set up to draft the Lokpal Bill is carrying out a 'campaign of defamation' by some Congress leaders against members of the society
 
 hazaare ne unase aagrah kiya tha ki vah apane sahyogiyon ko salaah den ki vah kanoon kaa masauda taiyaar karne kii prakriya ko patari se utaarne kaa prayaas nahin karen
 He also questioned the Congress President whether he had the permission to do so

 According to the Delhi Tourism Department, the foundation of India Gate was laid by the Duke of Connaught in 1921, designed by Edwin Lutyens and inaugurated by Viceroy Lord Irwin 10 years later

 indian mujahiddeen ke khaufnak iraade ab ek ek kar saamne aa rahe hai
 The chargesheet filed in Mumbai's MCOCA court has revealed that one of the four modules of IM was a fidayeen module targeted at several vvips
 dilli main jamiya ke bottla house se giraftaar indian mujahidin ke sadsy mohammad saf ne apane bayaan main khulaasa kiya he ki indian mujahiddeen ke chaar hisse hai
 Sahabuddin Brigade, Mohammad Ghaznavi Brigade, shaheed-al-zarqawi Brigade and Media Cell

 Its job is to carry out suicide attacks on VVIP convoys

 According to Saif, Shaheed al-zarqawi Brigade's leader Mo Atif Amin was in direct contact with a man named Amir Raza Khan, who is the founder of the Indian Mujahideen, in Pakistan, besides the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and other terrorist organizations
 And this is the reason that the Mumbai Crime Branch has now stepped up the search for the absconding terrorists in this case
 tamaam giraftaareyon or encounter ke baad bhi khatara abhi tala nahin he kyonki indian mujahiddeen abhi bhi jinda he
 The police are vigorously searching for the mastermind of the attacks in India, because all the terrorists who have been killed or arrested so far were the ones who carried out the attack

 It is very important to reach them to check terrorist incidents

 Those who do not agree with us politically, did not call them anti-nationals
 unhone aage likhaa, 'party nagarikon ke vyaktigat or raajnneeti pasand kii swatantraaa ke paksh main rahi he

 On the other hand, it emerged from the Advani camp that he was angry with the way the ticket was not cut
 kyonki aisa karne se pehle party ke sheersh netritv ne unase sampark bhi nahin kiya

 ji-20 or usase pehle america yatra ke dauraan trump modi mulaakaat main ek nai shuruyaat hui he
 For the first time in history, India has started purchasing crude oil from America
 sirf bharat hi nahin usase pehle china, korea jaise desh ab khadi deshon se alag hatakar kachche tel kii kharid america se kar rahe hai
 It was illegal in the US to sell crude oil
 Now two years before it was not possible in America, it was unthinkable that a country would take crude oil from America
 lekin ab kachche tel se bhare tanker america port se nikalakar darjanon asian deshon ke tat par pahunch rahe hai
 The United States has approved the sale of its oil companies due to the fall in global crude oil prices for the past three years, bankrupt oil companies and rising unemployment in the sector
 obama sarkaar ne di manzoorigauratlab he ki beete 40 saal se america main kisi desh ko kaccha tel bechney par pabandi lagi hui thi
 Except the Canadian oil companies could not sell crude oil to any country in the world
 lekin 2015 main kachche tel kii keemton main darj hui badi giravat ke baad tel companiyon ko bachaane ke liye america main baraak obama prashasan ne is pratibandh ko kamjor karte hue asian deshon ko tel bechney kii ijaajat de di thi
 India is the third largest buyer of crude oil in the world for oil tankers from India to India and till now it used to be purchased from Gulf countries
 lekin haal main pradhanmantri narendra modi or america ke raashtrapati donald trump kii hui mulaakaat ke baad pehali baar bharat ne america se kachche tel kii kharid kii he
 Indian company Indian Oil has completed the first consignment of crude oil from the US oil company and by October this year, the tanker filled with crude oil will start arriving at the port of India
 asia ko kachche tel kii supplai ho rahi majbootsaal 2015 main baraak obama prashasan se manjuuri milane ke baad america kaaesia ko kaccha tel niryaatdhire-dhire bad rahaa tha
 But in 2017, US companies started getting crude oil orders from about a dozen Asian countries
 maujuuda aankadon ke mutabik america companiyaan apane kul production kaa lagbhag 15 fisadi kaccha tel asian deshon ko bech rahi hai
 Why US crude is being sold to Asia In 2014, global crude oil prices began to fall
 iske baad 2015 tak antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemten 20 dollar prati bairal par pahunch gai
 As a result of this, production losses for the oil companies around the world started to be settled
 iskaa sidhaa asar america oil sector par padaa or is dauraan akele america main oil sector se 1 lakh se zyada log berozegaar ho gaye the
 While the Barack Obama administration lifted the ban on selling crude oil, this decision became very important for the policies of the new President Donald Trump
 trump prashasan kii daleel he ki vah mahaj global demand-supplai ko banaae rakhane ke liye oil sector main niryaat kaa sahaara le rahaa he
 But sector experts claim that this will reduce crude dependence on the Gulf countries of Asia and increase US participation in crude oil exports
 vahiin is niryaat se america revenue main hone vaala ijapha donald trump ke america first kaarykram ke saath-saath nai naukariyaan paidaa karne main sahaayat hoga

 Suspense has started to increase about whether Navjot Singh Sidhu, who left BJP about a month ago, will join the Aam Aadmi Party or not
 rajyasabha se istipha dene ke baad siddhu ne aam aadmi party ke bade netaaon se lekar siem arvind kejariwal se jo gupachup mulaakaaten kii hai, uskaa koi sakaaratmak nateeja nikalataa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 According to Aam Aadmi Party sources, Navjot Singh Sidhu has demanded to be the CM candidate in Punjab but the party leaders want to field Sidhu as a star campaigner
 AAP siddhu ko siem ummidavaar banane ke paksh main nahigast kii shuruyaat ke saath hi party ke bheetar is baat ko lekar charchaa tej thi kickejarivalke vipashyana se lautate hi siddhu aam aadmi party main aadhikarik taur par shaamil ho jaaenge
 But if sources are to be believed, the matter is being dragged out because the talks with the leaders have not been successful
 darasal aam aadmi party, navjot singh siddhu ko mukhyamantri ummidavaar banane ke paksh main bilkul nahin he
 a big reason for this is the charge of murder on Sidhu
 siddhu apane or patni ke liye chaahate hai tiktapunjab main satta kii jameen talash rahiaam aadmi partikoi risk lenaa nahin chaahati he or na hi bevajaah kisi vivaad main funsana chaahati he
 According to party sources, many leaders have refused to give tickets to both husband and wife, citing the constitution of the Aam Aadmi Party
 is samvidhan main ek hi parivaar se 2 sadasyon ko chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar nahin diya jaataa he
 According to the churning threads about Sidhu in the AAP, the Aam Aadmi Party had agreed that apart from contesting elections from Sidhu's wife Kopunjab, Sidhu's wife would be given a ministerial position if the government is formed
 lekin navjot singh siddhu ke mukhyamantri pad kii jid se baatcheet bigadati dikh rahi he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from Rajya Sabha and BJP on 19 July
 punjab main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, aise main siddhu ke party se judane kaa suspence agar jald khatm nahin hua to aam aadmi party kii chintaa jarur bad sakati he

 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane main ab das din hi bache hai
 After the results, whichever party forms the government at the center will face a new challenge
 pichley kuch maheenon main kai khaadya vastuon kii keemten badhane lagi hai
 In many parts of western and southern India, prices of food items have increased due to drought and early summer
 chunaav main nahin tha mahangaai koi masalagauratlab he ki bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke daur main desh ko mahangaai se kaaphi raahat mili thi
 Food inflation and retail inflation were both low
 lekin ab centre main jo bhi sarkaar aegi, uske liye badhati mahangaai phir se ek chunauti paidaa kar sakati he
 During the era of the UPA government, the public was troubled due to very high inflation figures and due to this, an atmosphere was created against the government
 lekin is baar ke aam chunaav main mahangaai koi masalaa hi nahin he
 Estimates of rising inflation In the last week, a survey by the news agency Reuters, most experts have believed that the inflation rate for the month of April can go up to six months
 haalanki iske baavjood yah rigerv bank ke liye suvidhajanak str 4 fisadi se kam rah saktaa he
 The government will release the inflation data for the month of April on Monday
 subjiyon-anaaj ke bad rahe daamalagataar nau maheene se mahangaai rigerv bank ke liye suvidhajanak str par bani hui he
 The Reserve Bank has cut interest rates twice in February and April
 survey main shaamil 40 arthshaastriyon ne kaha he ki april main mahangaai dar badhkar 2
 It can reach 97 per cent, while it is 2 in March
 86 fisadi thi
 The main inflation figures are increasing due to the rise in the prices of food items like vegetables, grains
 kachche tel kii badhati keemton se mushkingle maheenon main mahangaai ke or badhane kii ashanka vyakt kii ja rahi he
 In fact, the prices of crude oil are increasing in the international market and it is believed that the government is not increasing the prices of petrol and diesel in the country in view of the elections, that is, they may increase their prices after the elections
 eendhan kii keemton ke badhane khaadya vastuon kii keemten or bad jaaengi
 Some experts also say that the rise in inflation will be beneficial for the farmers, but it will be bad for the consumers and a challenge for the next government
 indian express ke anusaar, subjiyon ke daam pichley ek saal main 13 se 15 fisadi tak bad chuke hai
 The biggest problem is in milk, because animal feed is becoming increasingly expensive

 Ramakant Yadav won the assembly elections for the first time as an independent candidate from Phulpur in Azamgarh in 1985
 tab se ab tak, lagbhag 34 varsh kii raajnneetik yatra main ramakant chaar baar vidhayak or chaar baar hi saansad rahe hai
 In 1989, MLA Sansadarmakant Yadav reached the assembly for the second time in 1989 on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket from Phulpur assembly constituency in Azamgarh district
 iske baad vah sapa main shaamil ho gaye or 1991 or 1993 main bhi nirvaachit hokar vidhansabha pahunche

 In 2007, Mayawati, the BSP president and the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, summoned Umakant to meet him and arrested him outside his residence
 iske baad ramakant ne basapa chhod di thi
 How well the relations with Maya can be gauged from the fact that while campaigning in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when Amit Shah described Azamgarh as the land of terror, Mayawati then retaliated to BJP candidate Ramakant
 The biggest terrorist was told

 However, after Yogi became the Chief Minister, the gap between the two widened
 phulpur or gorakhpur loksabhaa seat ke liye hue upachunaav main haar ke baad ramakant neyogi ke khilaaf morchakhol diya tha
 Ramakant had directly attributed the defeat to Yogi and the state organization, saying that Yogi Adityanath had failed to take everyone along
 unhone siem yogi par ek jati vishesh ko badhaava dene kaa bhi aarope lagaaya tha
 The distance in relations with Yogi Adityanath began with a statement given by Rajnath Singh in 2016, in which he talked about the quota within the quota
 ramakant ne rajnath ke bayaan par kadi pratikriya vyakt karte hue swayan or yogi adityanath ko morcha sanbhaalane kii baat kahi thi
 Yogi Adityanath had to explain that he would stay on the party line, not Ramakant

 The Supreme Court has refused to stay a stay on 'udta Punjab' just two days before its release
 desh kii sarvocch adaalat ne relies par roak lagane vaali do yachikaaon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki maamle main punjab or haryana hai court main apil karen
 The film 'udta Punjab' was challenged in the Supreme Court by the 'human Rights Awareness Association' and the Kanjar community of Punjab after getting the green signal from the Bombay High Court
 bombai hai courtne film ko sirf ek cat ke saath relies karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 In its order, the court said that there is nothing in 'udta Punjab' that raises any question on Indian sovereignty or integrity
 court ne kaha- waapas aa sakate hai scmamale kii sunwaayee ke dauraan film ke nirmaataa or yachikakartaon ne justise adarsh kumaar goyal or justise alen raav kii bench ko bataaya kii punjab and haryana hai court main bhi guuruuvaar ko is maamle par sunwaayee he
 On this, the Supreme Court told both the petitioners that we will not give any decision on these petitions yet
 aap donon ko yachika waapas lene kii ijaajat dete hai or punjab and haryana hai court se faisla aane ke baad aap waapas supreme court aa sakate hai
 However, during the hearing of the case many times the court also raised many sharp questions from both sides
 court ne yachikakarta enjio se poocha, 'is maamle main aapkaa locas kya he? or aap aisa koun koun-sa kaam logon ke bhale ke liye punjab main kar rahe hai? jo kaam aap vahaan kar rahe hai uske saboot hai aapke paas?''kai dialogs behad ashleel hai'duusari taraf film ke nirmaataaon se supreme court ne poocha ki film ne kai dialogs behad ashleel hai, kya unki vaaki jarurat he? kya use hataaya nahin janaa chahie? is par producers kii ore se pesh ho raheen vakil minakshi arora ne kaha, 'cat 5 main jo dialogs hai unhen agar aap alag se dekhen to wo aapattijanak jarur lagate hai, lekin agar aap puri film ko dekhen to paaenge kii wo dialogs behad jaruri hai
 Dialogues and language are very important aspects of the film
 'supreme court ne purv main film 'bandit queen' ke nirmaataaon ko bhi isi baat kaa dhyaan rakhte hue raahat di thi
 The censor copy of the film has been leaked, it is said that before the censor board gave the certificate to Anurag Kashyap's film 'udta Punjab', he was ordered to scissor on many scenes of the film, while Kashyap and his Phantom Films in the court Knocked on the door yah film 17 june ko relies hone vaali he, jabaki isse thik pehle film kii sensor copy online li ho gai he
 The Bombay High Court has allowed the release of 'udta Punjab' with the order of giving one cut and three disclaimers

 In response to a question, he said that the guidance given by the Supreme Court in the case will be valid
 vahiin, supreme court ne babari masjid vidhwans maamle ko do hafte tak ke liye taal diya
 It may be noted that the apex court is hearing a petition seeking criminal conspiracy case against the senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti in the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case
 uma bharti ne kaha ki ham maamle main supreme court ke faisle ko khushi-khushi sweekaar karenge
 However, she cannot make any proposal at this stage
 bijepi netaa ne kaha,"maine tirangaa ayodhya yatra ke liye kabhi maafee nahin maangi
 For this, i have sacrificed even the Chief Minister's chair
 agar jarurat padi, to main ramalala ke liye jaan bhi qurbaan kar duungi
 The CBI has moved the Supreme Court against the Allahabad High Court order dismissing criminal conspiracy charges against BJP and Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders including Advani, Joshi, Bharti, and the then Chief Minister of UP and the current Governor of Rajasthan, Kalyan Singh

 kirodi laal meena ne rajya main essi-asti par ho rahe atyaachaar ke khilaaf badi sankhya main mahilaon or purushon ko lekar jaipur police kamishnar ke daftar kaa gheraav kiya
 Meanwhile, MP Kirori Lal Meena warned the Jaipur Police that today i am raising my voice against my government, if action is not taken then i will also agitate against the government
 meena jaipur ke paas tuunga main dalit or adivasee mahilaon ke upar hue police atyaachaar ke maamle ko lekar logon ke saath jaipur police kamishnar ke daftar pahunche the
 On this occasion, a large number of women from the village sang songs with performances and dances outside the commissioner's office
 police kamishnar sanjay agarwal ne pradarshnakariyon ko vaarta ke liye bulaayaa or jaanch badalane kaa bharosa dekar kaha ki puure maamle kii phir se jaanch karai jaaegi
 Rajya Sabha MP Meena said on this occasion that the police have spoken their rote, but if the results are not right, i will agitate again
 bataa den ki rajasthan main chunaav behad kareeb he or vipakshi congress pehle se hi pradesh main daliton par atyaachaar ko mudda banaati rahi he
 Now the BJP government itself is in the dock after the allegation of a senior leader of its own party
 virodh darj karaane ai mahilaon ne kaha ki police aadhi raat ko unako ghar se uthaa le gai or 24 ghante tak khaanaa pani bhi nahin diya
 Even kept locked up in lockup
 police ne inhen ye kehete hue pakadaa tha ki ye ret khanan mafiaon se mili hui hai or police par hamale karti hai, jabaki in mahilaon kaa kahana tha ki ret mafiaon se inkaa dur-dur tak koi rishta nahin he or dalit hone kii vajah se police un par atyaachaar karti he
 Many women from Tunga also demonstrated their injuries while performing outside the Police Commissioner's office
 bijepi saansad meena ne kaha ki police thane main bajri mafia baithe rahete hai or police ret or sharaab mafiaon ke saath milakar dhandha karti he
 After this rebellious attitude of Meena, many kinds of discussions are hot in political circles
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kirodi laal meena bhale hi bijepi main aa gaye hai lekin mukhyamantrivasundhararaaje se inkaa dil nahin miltaa he
 Meena, who merged her party with BJP through BJP national president Amit Shah, is yet to find a respectable place in the BJP and no special consideration is being given to ticket distribution
 meena ke saath rah rahe kaaryakartaaon ne bataaya ki agar bijepi doctor sahab kaa sahi sammaan nahin karti he to doctor sahab apana alag rukh akhriyaar kar sakate hai
 Dr
 Kirori Lal Meena is a strong leader of the society and Kirori Lal Meena has a good hold in the Meena vote bank

 The BJP government of Haryana will give the status of cabinet minister to Yoga Guru Ramdev
 is bare main ek prastaav ko khatter cabinet ne hari jhandi de di he
 Swami Ramdev's grand honor ceremony will be held on April 21 at Panchkula where he will be declared the brand ambassador of the state
 samaaroh kii taiyaari jor shor se chal rahi he
 The state government has already announced to set up a herbal park, Ayurveda University in association with Ramdev's Divya Jyoti Sansthan
 panchkula main antarrashtriya yoga centre kholane ke liye bhi ramdev kii sahaayta lee jaaegi
 Apart from this, there is also a proposal to train Ayurveda physicians of the state in the ashram of Divya Jyoti Institute, Haridwar
 bijepi sarkaar pradesh ke sabhi 6500 gaanvon main yogashaalaayein kholane par bhi vichaar kar rahi he
 Ramdev will play an important role in all these schemes
 mana ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan swami ramdev ne bijepi ke liye prachaar main edi chotii kaa jor lagaaya tha, ye sab usee mehnat kaa fal he
 However, the Congress had made a sharp attack in the budget session to make Ramdev the brand ambassador and also accused the government of saffronizing
 loksabhaa se teen talaak bill ko manjuuri dilaane ke baad ab centre sarkaar ne rajyasabha main is bill ko charchaa or paas karaane ke liye laayaa he
 Discussing the triple talaq, Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Ami Yagnik said that the bill is not only related to a woman but to her entire family
 mahilaon ko teen talaak se mukti dilaaein, lekin unhen court main mat dhakeliye
 This is not the case of women in one community but in another community
 yaajik ne kaha ki mahila shashaktikaran ke bank ground main ham bhul jate hai ki court ke faisle ke baad yah practice nahin rahani chahie
 Yagnik said that women empowerment has been pushed by the government in a court and that too by making crime
 isse aap mahila ke saath nyaay nahin karne ja rahe
 Ami Yagnik said that this roti turned black, the food is not good
 ye kisi ek samudaay kaa mudda nahin he
 This is the case of every community and not just Indians but also NRI weddings
 unhone kaha ki pati-patni ke nijee maamle main aap tisare vyakti ko kaise aane de sakate hai? shaadi ke maamle main aap kisi tisare vyakti ko laakar aap mahila ke moulik adhikaron ko chin rahe hai
 The woman has the right to live with dignity but through this bill she is being taken away
 congress netaa ne kaha ki supreme court ke faisle ke baad teen talaak pehle hi asanvaidhanik he to is par kanoon kii jarurat nahin he
 You pushed the woman to the magistrate's court
 apane family ke liye ab use magistrate court main jane par majaboor kar diya
 Ami Yagnik said why the government is not worried for all the women of the country
 unhone kaha ki gujarat kii ek maa mere paas ai or kaha ki meri MBA ladki ko pati ne nikaal diya he, kyonki roti kaali ho gai thi
 These things are not just being faced by women, but women of all classes and religions have such complaints
 congress ne kaha ki vah mahila surat kii he or use kya kaha jaae
 Married, divorced or anything else
 unhone kaha ki ve mahila shashaktikaran or bill ke khilaaf katai nahin hai lekin baaki mahilaon ke bare main sarkaar kyon nahin soch rahi he
 He said that every woman has to face something like this in life and anyway the Supreme Court has abolished triple talaq
 court ne jise gaiyr kanoonee tehra diya aap us par kaise ek kanoon laa sakate hai
 Congress MP Yagnik said that justice and equality first of all speaks of dignity and that women should be equaled in society before law
 mahilaayein surakshit, bekhauf or sammanit jivan jeene kii puri hakdaar hai
 He said that do not discriminate between Indian women, everyone needs a husband and he has the right to bail
 congress saansad ne kaha ki kya mahilaayein apane adhikaar jaanati hai or unhen kanoonee sahaayta paane ke bare main jaankaree he
 Yagnik said that you have to depend on the magistrate for the question of bail and compensation, but how will the court be able to do justice in family matters
 mahila ko bacchon kii castady bhi chahie hogi
 This will be decided not in the Family Court but in the Magistrate
 unhone kaha ki bacchon ko samaj nahin aata kyon unke mata-pita court main lard rahe hai, kya sarkaar maamla nipatane tak un bacchon kaa dhyay rakhane ke liye taiyaar he
 Will the government be able to provide mental satisfaction and advice to the children
 aap 20 deshon kaa udhaaharan de rahe the lekin mahilaon ko court main mat dhakeliye

 The Delhi High Court has confirmed a man guilty of raping his minor niece and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment
 adaalat ne kaha is “jaghanya aparaadh” ne na sirf use shaareerik taur par nuksaan pahunchaaya he balki uske vyaktitv ko bhi hilaakar rakh diya tathaa “uski intaraatma ko apamaanit” kiya he
 Judge Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal upheld the lower court's September 2012 judgment in which the girl's warts were found guilty and sentenced
 unhone kaha ki ladki kii gavaahi kii pushti anya saakshyon or chikitsakeey sabooton se hoti he
 The High Court said that although there is no eyewitness to the crime but "other circumstances have been proved sufficiently" and the link of events is fully connected
 “isliye is nishkarsh se bachane kii koi sambhaavna nahin he ki sampurna maanviya sambhaavnaaon ke tahat kisi or ne nahin balki aaropee (doshi) ne hi yah jurm kiya he or sabit hui paristhitiyaan bina kisi chook ke aaropee ke jurm kii taraf ishaara karti hai
 " adaalat ne kaha, “apilkarta (doshi) ne ek naaballig ladki ke saath yah jaghanya aparaadh kiya he or usne na sirf peedit ladki ko shaareerik kshati pahunchaai he balki uski niztaa, garima or vyaktitv ko bhi dhwast kiya he
 He was psychologically harmed and humiliated his inner mind
 ” The court said that with these views, the High Court dismisses the plea of the convicted girl's warts against Rajesh Tiwari's lower court verdict in which she has been sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment
 police ke mutabik 20 march 2011 ko holi khilne ke dauraan bacchee ko phusalaakar apane saath aane ko kahkar apane ghar le gaya or vahaan uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 He even threatened the girl not to tell this to anyone
 tippaniyan Police told the court that the girl later informed her mother about the incident
 tiwari ne adaalat ke faisle ko yah kahkar chunauti di thi ki vah peedit kii ekmaatr gavaahi par bharosa karne kii galati kar rahi he
 The High Court, however, dismissed it saying that the testimony of the victim is sufficient and no other eyewitness is needed

 Steve Smith was considered to be Australia's most talented player since his debut in international cricket in February 2010
 westeindies ke khilaaf melbern main vanade main apane kariyar kii shuruyaat karne ke baad is harfanmaulaa ko test khilne ke liye bhi zyada intjaar nahin karnaa padaa
 He started his test journey against Pakistan at the historic ground of the Lord's (neutral venue)
 interneshal cricket main set hone main kuch samay lene ke baad steve ne jald hi chamak bikhareni shuru kar di
 Early in his career, he was identified as a spinner who showed his hand in batting in the lower order, but soon his identity as a bowler began to slow down and he made his mark as a batsman
 lekin vahi steve ab australia ke captain ke taur par apane sabase kharaab daur se guzar rahe hai
 (read, bad days are not giving up the Australian team chase, pile on 85 runs) smith duniya ke un chand khilaadiyon main hai jinke test or vanade ke aankade behad prabhaavshaalee hai
 Virat Kohli of India, Joe Root of England, Ken Williamson of New Zealand and Hashim Amla of South Africa, along with 27-year-old Steve Smith are among the most talented batsmen in world cricket
 hobart test ke pehle tak jahaan 45 test maichon main 57
 With an impressive average of 40, he has scored 4133 runs with the help of 15 centuries, while 41 in 87 odis
 31 ke ausat se 2644 ran score kiye hai jisamen 6 saikade shaamil hai
 Although Smith is not skilled in terms of technique, he is successful both in stopping the wicket and scoring fast due to his ability to struggle
 yah smith kii pratibha hi thi ki maaikel clark kii captaini ke samay main hi unhen team kaa bagdor sanbhaalane kaa aglaa daavedaar mana jane laga tha
 Significantly, under the leadership of Alan Border, Ricky Potting and Michael Clarke, Australia wrote a new chapter of success
 smith main bhi captain or ballebaaj ke taur par shuruyaat main aisi hi chamak dikhaai
 They were extremely successful against India
 team india ke khilaaf unhone 6 test main 93 ke ausat 930 ran banaae jisamen chaar shatak shaamil the
 67 against New Zealand in the same sequence
 87 ke ausat se 543 ran banaae hai
 But now it seems that Smith's brightness is slowing down
 unki captaini main australian team ke pradarshan main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he
 The comments haal hi main srilanka ke khilaaf siries main unki captaini main australia ko 0-3 ke ekatarfa antar se haar mili , vahiin dakshin africa ke khilaaf vanade siries main bhi kangaroo team ko 0-5 ke antar se clin sweep kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Nobody expected that the performance of long-time Test number one and five-year world champion Australia would fall so much
 yahi nahin, srilanka ke khilaaf vahaan hui test siries main haar ke baad jis tarah se vanade maichon ke bich steve smith swadesh laute, maaikel clark or maaikel slator jaise purv khilaadiyon ne us faisle par bhi sawaal uthaae
 It seems that Smith is losing the confidence of fellow players due to the recent decline in Australian team performance
 vanade ke baad dakshin africa ke khilaaf test siries main bhi kangaroo team ab tak sangharsh karti najar ai he
 After losing the first test, in the first innings of the second test, the Australian team was reduced to just 85 runs
 jaahir he, is mushkil daur main smith ko vishwaas bahaali ke liye kuch khaas karnaa hoga
 
 
 Stevie soon began to shine after taking some time to set in international cricket
 kariyar ke prarambh main unki pahchaan ek aise spinner ke rup main thi jo nichle kram main ballebaaji main bhi haath dikhaa letaa tha lekin jald hi gendbaaj ke rup main unki pahchaan dhimi padane lagi or ballebaaj ke rup main ve apana mukaam banaate gaye
 But the same steve is now going through its worst phase as Australia's captain
 ( padhe, bure din australian team kaa peechha nahin chhod rahe, 85 ranon par hui dher) Smith is among the few players in the world whose test and ODI figures are very impressive
 bharat ke viraat kohli, england ke jo root, newjiland ke ken williamsan or dakshin africa ke hashim amala ke saath saath 27 saal ke steve smith ko vishwa cricket ke sabase pratibhavan ballebaajon main shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Till the Hobart Test, 57 of 45 Test matches
 40 ke prabhaavshaalee ausat se unhone 15 shatakon kii madad se 4133 ran banaae hai, vahiin 87 vanade maichon main unhone 41
 Scored 2644 runs at an average of 31 which included 6 hundreds
 haalanki takanic ke lihaaj se smith kushal nahin he lekin apni sangharsh kshamta ke boote ve wicket par rukne or teji se ran banane, donon main safal hai
 It was Smith's genius that he was considered the next contender to take over the reins of the team at the time of Michael Clarke's captaincy
 gauratlab he ki alan border, riki poting or maaikel clark ke netritv ke daur main australia ne kamyaabi kii nai ibaarat likhi
 Smith also had a similar glow in the beginning as captain and batsman
 bharat ke khilaaf to ve behad kaamyaab rahe
 Against Team India, he scored 930 runs at an average of 93 in 6 Tests which included four centuries
 isi kram main newjiland ke khilaaf unhone 67
 Has scored 543 runs at an average of 87
 lekin ab aisa lagane laga he ki smith kii chamak dhimi padati ja rahi he
 The Australian team's performance in their captain is steadily declining
 tippaniyan In their recent series against Sri Lanka, Australia lost to Australia by a unilateral margin of 0–3, while in the ODI series against South Africa, the Kangaroo team also faced a clean sweep by a margin of 0–5
 kisi ko ummid nahin thi ki lambey samay tak test number van or paanch baar kii world champion australia ke pradarshan main is kadar giravat aa jaaegi
 Not only this, after the defeat in the Test series against Sri Lanka there, the way Steve Smith returned home in the midst of odis, former players like Michael Clarke and Michael Slater also questioned that decision
 aisa lag rahaa he ki haal main australian team ke pradarshan main ai giravat ke kaaran smith saathi khilaadiyon kaa vishwaas hi khote ja rahe hai
 After the ODI, the Kangaroo team has also struggled so far in the Test series against South Africa
 pehla test haarane ke baad duusare test kii pehali pari main bhi australian team mahaj 85 ranon par dher ho gai
 Obviously, Smith will have to do something special to restore confidence in this difficult period

 Remember the days when tent owners used to display steel wash basins in front of their shops to represent their businesses? It may still be the case in remote and rural areas, but at a place like Jaipur, the Taluka family is preparing new wedding plans for all the people
 sattar ke dashak ke aakhri saalon ke dauraan unhone marij garden kii sthapana karke apane tent ke kaarobaar ko debor yaa saajasja ke kaarobaar main badalane kii shuruyaat kii
 Now this year they have established the palatial site "the Gulmohar" in Kukas Town on Delhi Road near Jaipur as a wedding venue
 shaadi ke liye khaas banaaya gaya yah destination behad khubasurat hone ke saath-saath mehmaanon kaa swaagat karne ke liye har tarah kii suvidhaon se las he
 "the Gulmohar" is built on more than four acres of land
 yahaan par shaadi kii alag-alag rasmon ke liye behtareen intjaam kiye gaye hai
 The scene of the grand entry of the bride for the Varmala is created here in such a way that the viewers are left watching
 mehandi kii rasm ke liye khaas vyavastha kii gai he
 Currently there are four rooms to accommodate guests
 lekin abhi 40 or kamare ban rahe hai
 The business that led to weddings was inherited by Rajkumar Taluka and his elder brother Naval Kishore Taluka from his father Rameshwar Lal Taluka
 iskaa vistaar karne kaa kaam donon bhaaiyon ne behad talleenta ke saath kiya
 Rajkumar's 31-year-old son Akhil Taluka is also hardworking like his father and Tau
 unki yuva soch kaa asar da gulmohar par saaf dikhaai detaa he
 Its roof mounted solar panels are a clear proof of this
 urja sangrakshan ke mahatv ko samajhate hue unhone iskaa upyog apane bijness main kiya
 The idea of water harvesting is also a product of Akhil's brain
 marij garden se hatakar jaipur main shaadi-samaaroh ke liye ek khaas mahalanuma wedding destination kii shuruyaat karnaa apane aap main nai baat he
 Rajkumar says that we were all concerned about the availability of water at the beginning of "the Gulmohar"
 pani kaa strot bhi aisa chahie tha jo lambey samay tak khaali na ho
 Rajkumar says, "my son suggested water harvesting for this
 yah suzav ham donon bhaaiyon ko bahut acha laga
 "the taluka brothers carried out this without delay
 chah water harvesting dhaanche banawaye gaye
 Rain water is collected in it
 rajkumaar yaad karte hai ki chaar dashak pehle jab unhone tent kaa kaarobaar shuru kiya tha, ve har roj subah dukaan kholte vakt apane tent ke kaarobaar ke sinboard ke taur par steel kaa bana ek wash basin dukaan ke baahar rakh diya karte the
 In those days tents were mostly installed on the roadside and sometimes on the road itself
 naval kishor kii shaadi isi tareeke se hui thi
 Tent owners also provided utensils and crockery which were counted with beds
 bache-khuche saamaan ko sadak ke kinare phenkakar kachare kaa ambara laga diya jaataa tha
 That garbage kept rotting there for several days
 rajkumaar kehete hai, ''mujhe vah badboo behad bahut nagavar guzarati thi
 "to get rid of this odor, they have set up a garbage disposal plant in Gulmohar
 jab logon ne unase shaadi sambandhit duusari sevaayen muhaiyaa karaane kii maang kii, to unhone cataring kii bhi shuruyaat kii
 In 1980, he started the marriage garden by taking land on lease from a relative on the main road Prithviraj Road
 us samay tak marij garden bilkul nayaa concept tha
 Rajkumar recalls, "I was married in a marriage garden
" " naval kishor bataate hai ki yah aisa vakt tha jab log shaadi ke liye ek hi chat ke neeche har cheez kii maang karne lage the or alahada jagahon par alag-alag chizon kaa order dene kaa sirdard mol lenaa nahin chaahate the
 It proved easy for him to spread his arms and legs in other areas related to marriage
 ek jamaana tha jab taluka parivaar ne mughale ajam, razia sultan, gora kaala or james bond kii octopasi sareekhee filmon kii shooting ke liye ghode, oont or aadmi muhaiyaa karaae the
 It was a testament to the eye of the Taluka family that they held the most prized "marriage Garden", known as Shahi Bagh, inside the world's top-ranked Heritage Hotel Ram Bagh Hotel Complex on lease
 ve is pratishthit hotel ke duusare lon main shaadiyon or duusare aayojanon main saajasja kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 He also has another land in front of Ram Bagh on a lease for "marriage Garden"
 ''gulmohar marij garden" kii ab tak hui hyprople shaadiyon kaa zikr karte hue ve bataate hai ki yah ab tak nagpur ke haldiram gharaane jaise jane-maane kaarobaariyon ke parivaar kii shaadi kaa venue ban chukaa he to jaipur neshnal uniwarsity ke chancelar kii beti kii shaadi bhi yahaan par ho chuki he
 Gulmohar has arranged the wedding of many famous people
 rajkumaar kehete hai, ''hamaare liye tasalli kii baat yah he ki jitani shaadiyaan yahaan huin, ve sabhi behad santasht hokar yahaan se gaye
 "rajkumar Taluk says that recently there was an opportunity to decorate for Ganesh installation in Mukesh Ambani's house Antilia

 haal hi main unhen shaadiyon ke intjaam ke liye mumbai, pune, goa, dilli or kolkata se bhi order mil rahe hai
 The Taluka brothers say that the government should consider promoting marriage tourism

 Regional parties have different mentality and preferences
 ve sangheey dhaanche kaa hissaa to hote hai lekin unki soch kahin alag hoti he
 It is not that the NDA does not have regional parties but their strength is far less due to the strengthening of the BJP
 jab pramukh dal bada or vishaal hota he to phir kshetreey dal dab jate hai, sarkaar main bane rahanaa unki vivashtaa hoti he or ve apni sharton par ade nahin rah sakate
 In such a situation, running a government is relatively easy
 post pole survey se ummid jagati he ki is baar aise hi parinaam aaenge
 In such a situation, the NDA government can run smoothly
 narendra modi ke kaam karne kii style aisi he ki vah zyada hastkshep pasand nahin karte or unke bare main yah kaha bhi jaataa he ki unke liye rashtrahit sabase badhkar he or iske liye ve jhukne ko taiyaar nahin hote
 In such a situation, there could have been a situation of confrontation
 ab unhen kaam karne ke liye badhiya mauka mila he
 It seems that the public is going to give them a big mandate and it will be a boon for them
 yah desh ke liye bhi acha hoga ki kisi bhi pradhan mantri ko kaam karne kii aazaadee ho, uske haath bandhe na hon jaisaa manmohan singh ke maamle main hamane dekha
 Split on the back of an honest Prime Minister because he had to bow to the demands of the regional parties
 us kaaran se hi bade-bade ghotaale hue
 However, the BJP is going to get a big gift from the public
 isse na keval use faisle lene main aasaani hogi or desh kaa shashan bina kisi dabaav ke chalegaa
