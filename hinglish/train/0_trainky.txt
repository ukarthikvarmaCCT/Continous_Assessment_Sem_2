 The time has come for the memorable outcome of the Lanka tour and for this India will have to win the Twenty20 match in Colombo on Tuesday
 bharat or srilanka pehali baar is formet main ek duusare se bhidenge
 Meaning no one is heavy on the mirror of data
 team india he cricket ke is sabase romaanchak formet kii shahenshaah
 One and a half years ago, the world has seen the strength of Team India
 is team ne dakshin africa main pehla twanti-20 match jeeta
 This team won the first Twenty20 World Championship and the players of this team made a mark in the IPL
 team india main gajab kaa balance he
 On arrival, Sehwag is there to blow the bowlers and Gautam Gambhir at the other end
 kisi vajah se openar jaldi laut bhi gaye to phir ghabaraane kii koi baat hi nahin he
 Apart from the leader Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a hitter like Yusuf Pathan is always ready in the dressing room
 sixsar ke is shahenshaah yuvaraj singh ko koun bhul saktaa he
 Who can forget Stuart Broad's six sixes off a ball, who can forget his bat hunger
 agar srilankai gendbaaj bhul bhi gaye to itnaa to pakkaa he ki yuvaraj ko saamne vaale kii yaaddashat tej karne main zyada vakt nahin lagegaa
 40 years old or 40 years young, if you are in Twenty20, then Sanat Jayasuriya looks a bit unfit
 beshak, is umr main jayasoorya apana tej dikhaate rahete hon lekin 40 over kaa khel to 40 saal ke khilaadi ke liye to bilkul nahin he
 And look amazing, Lanka is relying on its rusted weapon
 twanti-20 main srilanka kaa captain badal gaya
 Batsmen like Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara got rest but the team became a complete novice
 ye to sabhi jaanate hai ki aakhir le-dekar lanka ko twanti-20 kaa anubhav hi kitna he
 The m factor from above is also outside
 bhale hi bharat or lanka twanti-20 main ek duusare se na bhide hon, ipel main saath khelkar zyaadaatar khilaadi ek duusare ko bhaanp chuke hai or duniya bhar kii tiimon kii takat or kamazori jagazahir he
 In such a situation, how will the World Champion India maintain its status in this match
 aakhri van-de jitkar srilankai chiton main bhi kuch jaan laut ai he
 Anyway, it is not right to underestimate anyone in this format and when Sanath Jayasuriya is in the other team, then the danger increases somewhat
 ye wo khilaadi he jo jab chaahe is match kaa pasa palat saktaa he
 The new captain of the T20 team, Dilshan, has also shown the power of the bat and has proved that we too are no less
 lekin khaas baat ye he ki is team se nadaarad he wo naam jo hai is team kii pahchaan
 Neither Mahela, nor Murali, nor Sangakkara, nor Mendis
 vaise team main naa to oleraunders kii kami he or naa hi josh kii
 There is a lack of that crown which is the punishment for the head of Team India
 yani badshaah ko karnaa hoga chiton kaa shikaar tabhi rahegi badshahath barkaraar
 Sri Lanka handed Tillakaratne Dilshan the command of Twenty20 after being beaten in one-day
 is iklaute mukaable main dilashaan par zimmedaari ke saath dabaav bhi hoga
 But Dilshan, who is making his debut as captain, is excited by this responsibility

 ’ The news of Congress general secretary and in-charge of Eastern UP Priyanka Gandhi contesting elections from Banaras (varanasi) kept stirring up the politics of Purvanchal from time to time, but after the announcement of her not contesting from Banaras in the last, the wind of the Congress slowed slightly Gone
 isi hawa ko tej karne ke liye priyanka gandhi agle hafte se varanasi main camp kar sakati hai
 This thing came to light when Priyanka Gandhi came to know about Varanasi activists and candidate Ajay Rai through video calling on Thursday
 priyanka gandhi ne kaaryakartaaon se ilaake main congress kaa haal to janaa hi, saath hi unhone kaaryakartaaon ke andar josh bharte hue kaha ki ek-ek kaaryakartaaon ko apane-apane booth str tak ja kar mehnat kerani hogi
 When the workers wanted to know about their own program, they assured that they would camp here as many days as they wanted
 priyanka gandhi kii ye sadhi hui stritji rahi he ki wo kaaryakartaaon se baat bhi karti hai or wo jo khud karnaa chaahati hai, use karkartaaon se bulavaa kar unki ichha par kaam karte hue shrey kaaryakartaaon ko detii hai
 In this episode, she herself would want to camp in Benaras to churn out the remaining 13 seats of Purvanchal but called it from the mouth of the activists
 gauratlab he ki aakhri charan ke chunaav main uttar pradesh kii banaras sahit 13 siten hai, chunki banaras se khud pradhanmantri chunaav lard rahe hai, lihaaja iskaa prabhaav in 13 siton par bhi padegaa
 Therefore, Priyanka Gandhi is also preparing to camp in Benaras to control her influence on these 13 seats
 purvanchal kii ye 13 site purvanchal kii 10 jilon main aati hai
 These districts are Varanasi, Sonbhadra, Ballia, Ghazipur, Mau Azamgarh, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Bhadohi and Chandauli
 isamen teen jilon jonpur, baliya or azamgarh main do-do said hai jo is tarah he machhlishahar , salempur or lalganj
 In these 13 seats, except for Azamgarh in 2014, the remaining 12 seats were occupied by BJP, but this time these seats are not in 2014
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan jahaan bijepi ko kadi takkar de rahaa he, to vahiin congress ke ummidavaar kai siton par bijepi ko hi nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, if Priyanka Gandhi camps here and makes intensive visits to these areas, then it will make the BJP very difficult
 vaise bhi priyanka ke liye in ilaakon main congress kii paith bananaa unke liye chunauti bhi he kyonki wo is chunaav main purvanchal kii prabharee bhi hai

 uttar pradesh ke saifai jile main 22 july ko dhyanchand sports college kii kishori saloni kii sandigdh haalat main maut ho gai thi
 In this case Jaya Singh and Sakshi Baijal, members of the State Children's Commission team reached Saifai
 team kii sadsy jaya singh ne sports college main maamle se jude tamaam police adhikariyon, saifai ke jiladhikari, forensik team, jail suparintendate samet kai logon se mulaakaat kar maamle kii jaankaree lee
 The team also went to jail and questioned the accused woman
 bal ayog kii jaya singh ne is maamle main 6 ghante saifai or itawa main rahakar maamle se jude tamaam logon se poochtacha kii
 Team member Jaya Singh also went to Etawah District Jail to interrogate the accused woman
 jaya singh ne sabase pehle is maamle main jaanch adhikari sab inspector vasudev singh se saifai ke prashasnic bhawan main mulaakaat kii or ab tak kii jaanch ke bare main puri jaankaree lee
 The team then proceeded with its investigation and questioned the family members of the teenager Saloni, who died in the sports college, and all the people associated with it
 team ne sports college main kishori saloni ke hostel main rahane vaali coach parul, hostel kii warden mitu or kishori kii tamaam parichit ladakiyon se poochtacha kii
 Salonidar was found hanging from the fan, the matter is on the night of 22 July
 jab agle din subah ladkiyaan saloni ko jagaane ke liye gai to saloni apane hostel ke kamare main pankhe se lataki mili thi
 The family members have feared the death of the teenager
 kishori ke kamare main us vakt do ladkiyaan or so rahi thim, lekin jaanch ke mutabik un ladakiyon ko ghatana ke bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin chal paaya
 Later the investigation found that the teenager had also written a suicide note before dying, in which he had written about suicide by being upset about something
 saath hi likhaa tha ki hostel ke paas hi rahane vaali mahila yamini jo ki sports college ke athletics ke coach siddharth krishna kii patni he, un par aarope lagaaya tha ki vah usko kisi maamle main bevajaah galat tehra rahi hai, isi se pareshaan hokar vah apni jindagi khatm kar rahi he
 Police arrested the accused on the basis of the suicide note
 Police arrested Yamini on the basis of this suicide note and sent him to jail, but due to the ever increasing pressure and many flaws in the case, the State Child Commission took automatic cognizance of the case and the Children Commission The Chairman of the team constituted a team to investigate, after which the team of Children Commission arrived on Saturday (27 July) to investigate
 bal ayog kii team ke mutabik, is maamle main saifai ke jiladhikari jebi singh or jail suparintendate rajakishor singh ne puure maamle main kaaphi sahyog kiya
 The Child Commission team found that the matter needs to be properly investigated, as many aspects have been omitted during the investigation
 jaise marane vaali ladki saloni ke pita kaa aarope he ki is maamle main police ne puri tarah se saboot nahin jutaaye, kyonki saloni ko diary likhane kii aadat thi or police ne apni jaanch main abhi tak uske kamare se koi diary jabt nahin kii
 Negligence in investigation, based on the evidence found from the spot, the police have not yet matched the writing of the suicide note, because the college administration has not yet given the copy of Saloni's handwriting to the police
 iske alaava police ne abhi tak is maamle main aaropee mahila yamini ke pati or sports college main athletics ke coach siddharth krishna se poochtacha nahin kii
 In this case, it is also being told that Saloni had a conversation with a boy
 police ne abhi tak is tarah kii khoj bhi nahin kii he
 Also, the remaining two girls in her room did not know anything about the incident
 iske alaava abhi tak un bacchiyon kii counselling bhi nahin kii gai jisase ki vah puri baat bataa saken
 Hence, Jaya Singh, a member of the team of the Children Commission, inquired in all the ways on this matter and met the District Magistrate and inquired about the progress of the investigation in the matter
 jaya singh ne is maamle main aaropee mahila yamini se jila jail main poochtacha kii or uskaa paksh jaanane kii bhi koshish kii
 According to Yamini, she used to restrain the girls only about the wrong, they did not have any dispute with the rest of Saloni
 team ne mauka-e-vaardaat kaa bhi jayja liya or police kii di hui jaankaree ke aadhaar par tathyon ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 Later, instructing the investigation into the matter seriously and deeply, Jaya Singh of the Child Commission is preparing a detailed report on its behalf, which will be sent to the government after the forensic report and the missing statements and completion of the investigation by the police 
 gambhirtha se jaanch ke adeshsutron ke mutabik, report main maamle kii samvedansheeltaa or kishori kii sandigdh maut ko dekhte hue behad gambhirtha se jaanch karne kii baat kahi gai he
 According to the information, after the inspection of the team, the Saifai police administration has got ready and the exercise to investigate the matter afresh has intensified
 police prashasan ne sports college prashasan ko handriting samet tamaam tathy muhaiyaa karaane ke nirdesh die hai
 At the same time, it has been decided to interrogate every person associated with this case once again
 jaankaree ke mutabik, is maamle main abhi tak hatya karne kii baat saamne nahin ai he
 However, due to mental pressure, police are investigating about how serious the role of accused woman Yamini is in this suicide case

 According to experts, the viscera report is not enough to know the cause of Sunanda's death
 histopathology karne par hi yah nishchit ho paaegaa ki sunanda kii maut kis jehar se hui

 Those who are not chosen, the thieves are sitting in power through the door

 An important reason behind convening the RJD meeting today was that if Lalu Prasad Yadav is sentenced to more than three years, then what will be the party's strategy, under whose leadership the party will be pushed forward
 iske liye prakhand str se lekar rajya str ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon tak ko bulaayaa gaya
 Earlier, senior party leader Jagdanand Singh said that we have accepted Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the leader and in the year 2020 everything will be under his leadership
 jagadanand singh ne yah bhi kaha ki lalu ji ke jail jane se hamaari party or majboot hogi, kamjor nahin
 He said that if someone's intention is to weaken our party, then his intention will not be fulfilled
 yah cese saal 1996 se chal rahaa he
 Our party's ideology will never be weak

 Please tell that on 23 December, RJD President Laloo Prasad Yadav was convicted in the case of illegal withdrawal from Deoghar treasury
 uske baad 3 janvari ko un par sajaa elaan hona tha
 Therefore, the RJD held a meeting on 6 January so that by then the decision on Lalu Prasad Yadav is announced and after that the party will decide the future strategy
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 Today, Lalu Yadav has been sentenced to three and a half years in the fodder scam

 phir kya tha is naam ke saikadon profile unki najaron ke saamne aa gaye
 Although it was impossible to find her daughter from so many profiles, Sara did not give up
 unhone keleg maari naam ke saare profiles ko dekhnaa shuru kiya
 At that time, he got an eye on a profile whose picture was similar to his youth
 sara ko laga ki ho saktaa he ki keleg maari wats unki vahi beti ho jise unhone 19 saal pehle god de diya tha
 They sent him friend request and within five minutes they messaged each other on Facebook and both told that they are very similar
 sara ne keleg ko bataaya ki jis vakt unki beti ko god liya gaya tha tab uskaa naam keleg maari thomas tha
 Keleg then messaged and replied, 'mother'
 donon ne kareeb paanch maheenon tak massej ke jariye baatcheet kii
 Sarah and Keleg met a week ago and have been with each other ever since
 donon ne 1995 ke baad pehali baar shanivaar ko ek saath madars de kaa jashn manaaya
 Sara is very happy and says, 'I have been looking for Keleg for the last seven years, but i did not know the surname of those who adopted her
 phir maine fasebuk par sirf keleg maari likhakar search karnaa shuru kiya'
 According to Sara, 'when i saw the picture of Keleg, it was like my shadow
 jab vah mere saamne ai to maine use itani jor se gale lagaaya ki uski gardan tuutane hi vaali thi
 i can't believe i finally found him '
 vahiin keleg kaa kahana he, 'yah behtareen he
 It is as if we have never parted
 maine teen maheene pehle mujhe janm dene vaali maa kii khojbin shuru kii
 i always knew that we would meet one day or the other, but i did not know that all this would happen so soon '
 darasal, sara ko apni beti isliye god deni padi thi kyonki ladki ke pita ke saath unka rishta thik nahin tha
 In such a situation, the social workers were afraid that the home environment would have a bad effect on the young child, so they gave the Klegs the adoption of someone else
 ab itane saalon ke baad apni maa se milane par keleg kahati hai, 'mujhe apni maa mil hi gai
 We are very similar to each other '
 vahiin sara kaa kahana he, 'apni beti ko waapas paakar main saatven aasmaan par hum'
 On the other hand, the mother-bump adopting Keleg has refused to give her statement

 The International Cricket Council (ICC) report that described the Nagpur pitch as bad, was targeted by Team India Test captain Virat Kohli, expressing surprise
 kohli ne kaha, ‘jab africa pichon par timen 50 yaa 100 ran se kam par out ho jaati hai to kuch kyon nahin likhaa jaataa
 India won 124 runs in the third Test at Nenagpur to take a 2–0 winning lead in the four-match series
 yah match dhai din chalaa tha jiske baad isisi match referi jaiff kro ne apni report main pich ko antarrashtriya cricket ke liye upyukt nahin qaraar diya tha
 The BCCI has been asked to respond within 14 days
 media par kohli kaa nishanakohli ne pichon ko lekar media main aa rahi report par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 Kohli retorted on the report coming in the media and said, "in South Africa, scores of less than 50 runs were scored thrice in an innings but i did not see any such article on me
" dakshin africa main chah baar timen 100 ran se kam par out ho gai
 Never seen an article on it
 dekhie lekh likhane ke liye hote hai
 This is the mindset or the perspective of someone
 main ise tavajjo nahin detaa
 It doesn't matter to me or the team
 ’unhone kaha, ‘log apni ichha ke anusaar apane nazariye ko lekar likh sakate hai
 We are doing what we do best
 ’jab ek patrkaar ne doharaaya ki yah isisi kii aadhikarik report he to bhi kohli ne apana aakraamak ruukh barkaraar rakhaa
 The Indian captain said, 'yes, i (including the ICC) are speaking about everyone
 main sirf lekh likhane waalon kii baat nahin kar rahaa
 Unfortunately the circumstances of our country are exaggerated and this is the fact
 kyonki ham sirf pich ke bare main baat karte hai or jab ham dakshin africa main hote hai to ham sirf is bare main baat karte hai ki ham kitna kharaab khele
 'because of so much ruckus on the pitch, Keonkohali said,' This has been happening for some time
 ham apni maansikta main badlaav laa rahe hai lekin hamaare aasapaas ke log nahin badal rahe
 We are criticized for our technique but when the visiting team does not play well there is always talk about pitches
 ’ kotla kii pich ke bare main poochne par kohli ne kaha, ‘main pich ke bare main adhik nahin kahana chahta kyonki iske bare main kaaphi kuch kaha ja chukaa he
 It would be better if we talk about positive aspects
 kyonki jab team jitati he to aapako har jagah se samarthan milanaa chahie
 We always find the point to criticize people but we must give people confidence
 yahi kaaran he ki yah hamen tarksangat nahin lagata ki sabhi pich ke bare main baat kar rahe hai
 Referring to the Test played in Adelaide with the 'pink ball', Kohli said, 'I think no one wrote an article about the Adelaide Test which ended in two and a half days

 !!! a post shared by Milind Usha Soman (@milindrunning) on jan 3, 2018 at 2:29 am PSTA post shared by Earthy_5 (@ earthy_5) on Dec 17, 2017 at 7:27 pm PST shila dikshit kaa yah kahana ki sonia gandhi jimmedaari se nahin bhaagti hai or unka sabhi netaaon ke saath sahajata se ghulana milanaa ho jaataa hai
 Now what does this mean? What Sheila Dixit did not do is that Rahul Gandhi is a fugitive, that is, Rahul should have been present in the budget session of Parliament instead of going on leave for two months and should have opened a front against the government on the land acquisition bill
 yahi nahin kisaanon kii jo fasal barbaad hui he, usko lekar is vakt unke dukh-dard main shaamil hona chahie tha
 Sheila Dixit has corrected the matter, Rahul Gandhi is unable to mix easily with the leaders of his party
 yah anubhav shila dikshit ko hi hoga yaa congress ke duusare netaaon ko
 But it is certain that many leaders of the older generation, whether it is Hansraj Bhardwaj or Captain Amarinder Singh, are talking about giving more time to Rahul
 yahaan yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki in netaaon ne yaa to apni raajnneetik pari khel lee he yaa antim rajnatik daur main hai
 They all feel that after Rahul's arrival, they will not have any question
 rahul ke khilaaf bolne ke in netaaon ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai, punjab main captain amarinder pradesh adhyaksh pratap singh bajva se naaraaz rahete hai, to dilli main party kii kaman ajay maakan ko de dene se shila dikshit kii naaraazgi swaabhaavik he, kyonki shaayad shila dikshit ko lagata hoga ki maakan sandip dikshit ke liye party main koi jagah nahin denge
 Perhaps this is the reason why Sandeep Dixit has also given a statement in favor of Sonia Gandhi
 rahi baat hansraj bharadwaj kii to ab unhen ritair ho janaa chahie
 The Gandhi family gave him a lot
 paanch baar rajyasabha bheja, centre main mantri or phir rajyapal banaaya
 This is also the reason behind Rahul going on leave that he wants to run the Congress in his own way and make his team
 dikkat yaheen he kyonki jo log abhi party main faisle le rahe hai, unhen apni kursi khatre main dikh rahi he
 They do not know if they will have a place in Team Rahul
 sonia gandhi ke kaam karne kaa tarika alag he, vah rajeev gandhi ke team ke logon par bharosa karti ai hai or lambey samay se jude logon kaa sammaan karti hai or unhen darkinar nahin karti
 His political stature is much larger than Rahul's because of his rejection of the second prime minister's post
 saath hi rahul jaipur ke chintan shivi main satta ko jehar bataa chuke hai, jisase unki chhavi kuch aise netaa kii bani he jo raajnneeti main shaayad majaburi main hai
 Then their mark sheet also does not have good results
 yahi vajah he ki rahul apane aap main bharosa paidaa nahin karte hai
 Well it is being told that Rahul is going to come in a couple of days and will take part in the rally organized by the Congress in Delhi on 19 April
 magar itnaa to tay he ki rahul kii tajposhi kaa vakt thoda tal gaya he
 It was earlier this month, but now it will be by the end of this year
 haalanki rahul ke kehane par congress sanghathan ke andruni chunaav ke liye taarikh kii ghoshnaa kar di gai he
 This is a good start
 nae party pravaktaaon kii niyukti or kuch pradesh adhyakshon ko banane main bhi rahul kii chhap dikh rahi he
 The uneasiness that Rahul is seeing in the Congress, the sooner it ends, the better it will be for the party and Sonia Gandhi's role will also be awaited by all

 In such a situation, it is very disappointing to have private screening by the makers and to review the film on national channels
 ye system kii prakriya ke khilaaf samjhaute jaisaa he
 On the one hand, to accelerate the release process of the film, pressure is being put on the censor board and on the other side there is an attempt to destroy the sensor process
 ' prasoon joshi ne kaha, 'yah ek avasarwaadi udhaaharan pesh karne jaisaa he
 Now after the postponement of the film, the question is arising whether the makers have decided to postpone the film only after the censor board objected to it
 The ongoing controversy over Padmavati continues to grow
 uttar pradesh ke up mukhyamantri keshav praasad maury ne kaha he ki jab tak film se vivaadit ansh nahin hataae jaaenge, tab tak film uttar pradesh main relies nahin hogi

 unhone kaha he ki femes itihaaskaaron, film persenalities ke sadasyon kii ek samiti ko film kii kahani par vistaar se charchaa karnaa chahie
 Are the makers of Padmavati lying? Censor has returned filmraje has asked to think about all the results before giving the certificate to the censor board
 indore main kendriya mantri thanvar singh gahalot ne sensor board ko film se aapattijanak seens hataane ke liye kaha he
 Raje has written in the letter that filmmakers have the right to make films according to their discretion, but the constitution also states that fundamental rights have to be controlled to protect law and order and the sentiments of citizens

 bijepi ne kaha ki chunaav or narendra modi ke badhate kad ko dekhakar hi upie sarkaar ne afjal par faisla kiya
 Congress President Ahul Gandhi on Tuesday clarified his party's position in Madhya Pradesh over the Chief Ministerial candidate
 unhone kaha ki madhyapradesh kibijepisarkaar ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke khilaaf unki party kii ore se koi chunavi cheharaa pesh nahin kiya janaa congress kii ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 In an informal chat with select editors and journalists, Rahul was asked here why the Congress did not declare any Chief Ministerial candidate against Shivraj in the November 28 assembly elections in the state
 To this, the Congress president replied, "we are using the same strategy (not declaring a chief ministerial candidate in assembly elections) in Rajasthan like Madhya Pradesh
" "baharhaal, madhyapradesh congress adhyakshakmalnathor rajya congress chunaav abhiyaan samiti pramukh jyotiradityasindhiyako vipakshi dal kii ore se mukhyamantri pad kaa prabal daavedaar mana ja rahaa he
 When asked about this, Rahul said, "both our leaders have their own strengths
 kamalnath ke paas vistrut raajnneetik anubhav he, jabaki sindhiya yuva or urjavan netaa hai
 i want to take advantage of the strengths of both leaders in elections
 "unhone kaha, "apwaad kii baat chhod dijiye, lekin hamane ummidavaar chayan kii jo chunavi niti tay kii he, uske mutabik parachute se congress main aane vaale netaaon ko tikat nahin diya jaayegaa
 Along with this, the leaders who have lost three to four times in the last assembly elections will not get the Congress ticket usually
 "shivaraj singh ji mujh par cese lagaaie magar puraa pradesh jaanata he ki aapkaa parivaar vyaapman main shaamil he, i tendering main ghotaalaa hua he lagaao jitne manahani ke mukadmaa lagaaie mujhe fark nahi padhane vaala - rahul gandhi # congressformp@incindia@incmp@rahulgandhipic

 com / yy0evm5nl2— MP Congress (@incmp)october 30, 2018is vidhansabha chunaav main sattadhari bijepi ke saamne madhyapradesh main lagaataar chauthi baar jeet hasil karne kii chunauti he, jabaki congress rajya kii satta se pichley 15 saal kaa vanvaas khatm karne kii koshish main juty he
 Alleging factionalism in the Congress, the BJP has been making similar claims in its ongoing election campaign that the main opposition party in the state does not have a strong leader who can stand against Shivraj in the battle for the Chief Minister's post
 karnataka ke nattejey aane se pehle congress kii morchebandi shuru ho gai he
 Taking lessons from the elections in Goa and Manipur, this time Congress has also prepared its Plan B
 jaankaree ke mutabik congress ke aantarik survey main party ko karnataka main 111 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 Shortly after this signal, the party high command has sent two senior leaders Ashok Gehlot and Ghulam Nabi Azad to Bangalore
 karnataka prabharee kasee venugopal samet paanch sachivon ko bhi congress ne rajya main tainaat kar diya he
 All these leaders have already been sent to understand the political equations that are changing moment by moment in Karnataka
 mana ja rahaa he ki bahumat se dur rahane kii surat main congress jedies ko kareeb laane ke liye dalit siem kaa card bhi khel sakati he
 This time the battle of Karnataka is a little different
 gujarat jaisi kaante kii takkar yahaan bhi he
 What position the camel will sit here, no one can say yet
 agsit polase bhi tasviir saaf nahin ho paa rahi he
 So the addition-subtraction-multiplication after the result is still going on
 siddharmaiya jaisaa manza rajaneta bhi nateezon se pehle dalit siem ko samarthan kii baat kare to samaj lenaa chahie ki is baar maamla kitna pechida he
 However, the Congress has emerged as the single largest party in the India Today group-axis MY INDIA survey
 agsit pole ke mutabik, karnataka main congress ko 106 se 118 seat milane kaa anumaan he
 At the same time, BJP is estimated to get 79 to 92 seats
 iske alaava jedies ko 22 se 30 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 The vote share of Congress in the election is 39 percent, while BJP is estimated to get 35 percent of the vote
 karnataka kaa nateeja kuch bhi aae lekin uski gunj deshbhar kii raajnneeti main agle saal loksabhaa chunaav tak sunai detii rahegi
 If the Congress gets an absolute majority in Karnataka, it will be no less than the Sanjeevani boot for the 'grand Old Party'
 congress karnataka ke kile ko apane paas lagaataar duusari baar barkaraar rakhti he to isse deshbhar main party kaaryakartaaon kaa josh badhegaa
 This will directly mean that the bjp's headache will increase in the elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan later this year

 Excerpts: What will be the major challenges before the Modi government in Jammu and Kashmir? The people of the state are still thinking about the conditions to a large extent
 ve kisi bhi chor par pahunchane kii hadabadi main nahin hai
 Although they have reservations about many things, yet my input from the valley is that a large number of social and community leaders came forward and told our administration that they would handle the situations and at their level it was full We will try to avoid violence
 yah pichley paanch varshon main logon ke saath hamaare judaav ke kaaran sambhav hua he
 Even if some people are angry with our work, they are ready to give it a chance
 yah nishchit rup se ek acha sanket he or pichley ek saal main logon tak saamaan pahunchane main prashasan kii bhoomika or prayaason main eemaandaaree ke kaaran sambhav hua he
 He is working in our right now

 Maybe, because of this people are not able to express their resentment? i do not agree with this
 main hinsa kii ghatnaon or sadakon par gusse ke pradarshan main kami ke peeche kuch kaaran dekhtaa hum
 Things like Internet (and communications) blackouts are not new in the Valley
 main kashmir ke logon ke maanas ko samajhataa hum—agar unhone baahar aane kaa faisla kar hi liya to phir koi bhi pratibandh unhen roak nahin paaegaa
 After the death of Burhan Wani, the internet was shut down and the army was heavily deployed, yet thousands of people came out on the streets and threw stones

 An estimated 30,000 or more people walked out even when we blocked the roads

 People are not willing to take to the streets violently
 ab, hamaari chunauti yah he ki ham apane is nirnay ke laabhon ko jaldi se jaldi jammu-kashmir kii janata tak pahunchaaen
 This is the work that has the biggest challenges
 is nirnay ke aise kya laabh hai jo aap logon tak pahunchaana chaahate hai?sabase pehle, logon ko yah laganaa chahie ki rosemara kii jaruraton ke lihaaj se chijen behatar hui hai
 Secondly, i am telling my party that we should start the political process at the earliest
 philhal sthiti bahut anukool nahin he kyonki kai netaa yaa to ehtiyathan najarband kiye gaye hai yaa phir giraftaar kiye gaye hai, kyonki yah samay kii jarurat he
 Why are some of them creating so much uproar? i would like to point out that precautionary detention and arrests are a part of the lives of politicians

 The BJP ran a coalition government with the PDP for three years followed by Governor's rule

 Our efforts will now be in the same direction
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki kashmir ke logon kii salaah ke bina anuchhed 370 ko radd karnaa ek bada dhokhaa tha
 When Article 370 was introduced, nobody's views were taken into consideration — only Jawaharlal Nehru made a promise to Sheikh Abdullah that would be fulfilled — while the Bharatiya Janata Party has been saying for seven decades that we are not in favor of it Huh

 The Modi government reduced the status of Jammu and Kashmir from one state to a union territory - this has never happened in any other state after independence
 sabase pehle to puure jammu or kashmir rajya ko do centre shasit pradeshon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 But the Union Home Minister has said in the House that the existing system is a temporary measure as far as Jammu and Kashmir (region) is concerned
 ise bahut jald apana purna rajya kaa darja waapas mil jayega
 Due to certain circumstances created in the state at this time, it was required to run under the direction of the Central Government for some time

 The successful people are determined to be the best that they can be and continuously strive for excellence
 They are go-getters who believe in finishing any task that they take up within the stipulated time
 They, like the others, have the option of deferring the work or evading what needs to be done, but they don't
 The fact that they have a steely resolve to complete their tasks makes them succeed and sets them apart

 In this book, Rishi has written that his relationship with his son Ranbir Kapoor is a bit formal, just like he had with his father Raj Kapoor
 vahiin ranbir ne bhi likhaa he ki vah apane pita se behad pyaar karte hai lekin kai baar unhen donon ke bich kii dooriyaan khalati hai

 Ranbir has written that the father-son relationship is completely respectful and that he has never crossed a certain boundary in his relationship with Rishi
 (padhein- jab rishi ne pi thi daaud ibrahim ke saath chaay) Ranbir wrote in the preface, "I am very close to my mother
 mujhe lagata he ki mere dead ne mere saath sambandhon ko vaisaa hi swaroop diya jaise vah apane pita ke saath rakhte the
 And it is true that i have never crossed a certain boundary with them

 i sometimes wish that i would be friendly with them or spend more time with them
 '' abhinayta ne likhaa ki bhavishya main vah apane bacchon ke saath is tarah ke aupchaarik sambandh nahin rakhana chahenge

 main jaanata hum ki unke dil main bhi meri ichchhaaon kaa sthaan sabase upar rahata he
 They also take care of the economic aspects in my work
 isse ab main unke or zyada kareeb ho gaya hum
 '' ranbir kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki kabhi-kabhi vah apane pita se is duuri ko mahasoos karte hai par iske liye kuch kar nahin pate
 He wrote, 'sometimes i think i will call them and ask' Dad, how are you? ' But our relationship is not the same

 Here a tribal man had to walk for about 10 kilometers with his wife's body on his shoulder
 use aspataal se shav ko ghar tak le jane ke liye koi ambulance nahin mili, kyonki uske paase paise nahin the
 Dana Manjhi was accompanied by his 12-year-old daughter, who was crying cries after being left behind by her mother

 jiske baad dana maanjhi ne patni ke shav ko ek kapade main lapeta or use kandhe par ladakar bhavanipatana se kareeb 60 kilometre dur rampur block ke melghara gaanv ke liye paidal chalanaa shuru kar diya
 The story of Dana Manjhi of Odisha had not even come to the mind of the people that a similar case came to light in the Panchmahal in Gujarat

 The dispute over water took the form of sabotage and arson
 khaskar karnataka main logon ne sadak par utarkar joardaar virodh kiya
 There were violent protests in Karnataka over the Supreme Court's decision
 pradarshnakariyon ne bengaluru main kai gadiyon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya or sarkari vaahanon par hamale kiye
 The dispute is about the waters of the Cauvery river, which originates in Kodagu district of Karnataka
 lagbhag saadhe saat sau kilometre lambii ye nadi kushalanagar, mysore, shrirangapatna, triruchirapalli, thanjavur or mailaduthurai jaise shaharon se guzarati hui tamilnadu main bengal kii khadi main girti he
 Its basin covers 32 thousand square kilometers of Karnataka and 44 thousand square kilometers of Tamil Nadu
 karnataka or tamilnadu, donon hi rajyon kaa kahana he ki unhen sinchai ke liye pani kii jarurat he or ise lekar dashakon ke unke bich ladaai jari he
 Karnataka argued that due to less rainfall, the water level in Cauvery has decreased and that is why it cannot provide water to Tamil Nadu
 jiske baad tamilnadu ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 Tamil Nadu said that it needs water in any case, otherwise its millions of farmers will be destroyed
 duusari taraf karnataka ke apane tark the
 Most of the water of Kaveri is being used for drinking in Bengaluru and other cities, so it cannot provide water to Tamil Nadu for irrigation
 jiske baad shashan or prashasan ke str par laaparvaahee kii vajah se hinsa main teji ai, jisase logon or sarkari sampatti ko baari nuksaan pahunchaa
 There was a series of protests for several days
 logon ne is mudde ko lekar sarkari ravaiye par sawaal uthaaya
 People complained that if the issue was handled properly at the political level, the matter would not have increased so much
 jammu-kashmir main lagaataar hinsawaise to jammu-kashmir main hinsa kii chhitput ghatnaayen lagaataar hoti rahati hai
 Pakistan has always been plotting instability in the valley and separatists are used as pawns
 lekin kashmir main aatanki sanghathan hijbul mujahiddeen ke poster bvoy burhan vaani ke encounter main maare jane ke baad bhadki hinsa ne rajya se lekar centre sarkaar ko sochane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Initially, the manner in which steps were taken to control the situation created resentment among the people
 badhati ghatana ko dekhte hue desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khud morcha sambhala or tamaam suraksha agenciyon ko aadesh diya ki wo jald se jald halaat ko saamaanya karne kii koshish karen
 And he appealed to the people for peace
 dilli main bade str par hui baithak main sarkaar kii ore se tay kiya gaya he ki ghati main pradarshnakariyon par hathiyaaron kaa istemaal kam se kam kiya jayega
 Central forces will work closely with the Jammu and Kashmir Police to control the situation
 saath hi saamaajik str par logon kaa bharosa jeetne kii koshish kii gai
 a special peace envoy from Delhi reached the valley and met the intellectuals there to discuss the steps being taken to normalize the situation
 jisase baad dhire-dhire hinsa par lagaam laga
 But for nearly two and a half months, violence in the valley resulted in many lives and hundreds of people were injured
 kaledhan par lagaam ke liye notebandi kaa faislaazad bharat ke itihaas main aarthik morch par notebandi kaa faisla jisane suna hairaan rah gaya
 But this move of the government against black money and corruption got a lot of support from the public
 vaise bhi sarkaar ke liye ye faisla lenaa aasaan nahin tha
 But with the announcement of demonetisation, PM Modi said that he will not hesitate to take strict decisions to run the country on the path of progress
 unhone notebandi kii samasya se chhutkaaraa dilaane ke liye logon se 50 din kaa vakt maanga
 However, at the political level, the decision was strongly opposed by the opposition
 lekin sarkaar ne saaf kar diya ki deshhit main kuch kathor kadam uthaane kii zarurat he or modi sarkaar aage bhi aise kadam uthaane main sankoch nahin karegi
 Significantly, on November 8, PM Modi, in his address to the country, called the 500 and 1000 rupee note as illegal, and ordered its removal
 jiske baad puraane note badalawaane or nae note paane ke liye bainkon or atm ke baahar logon kii bheed umadane lagi
 People never raised their voice against demonetisation despite heavy troubles and standing in line for hours
 sarkaar ke liye ye badi raahat kii baat rahi, kyonki sarkaar ne notebandi ko deshhit main bataate main hue 60 saal ke itihaas main aarthik sudhaar kii disha main uthaaya gaya sabase bada kadam bataaya
 People stood in line outside banks and atms for cash from morning to evening, but did not utter a word against the action taken in the interest of the country
 saal 2016 ke aakhir main notebandi kaa faisla vaise to aam janata ke liye ab tak pareshaani bharaa rahaa he, kyonki nakadi kii killat main abhi tak puri tarah dur nahin hui he
 But if we talk about the will of the government, then the Modi government proved this by taking the decision of demonetisation
 bhale hi iske parinaam ummid ke mutabik naa mili, lekin jab-jab saal 2016 kii baat hogi to notebandi kaa ahm faisla or modi sarkaar kaa zikr jarur hoga
 Liquor ban in Bihar: Before the assembly elections in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was promised in public meetings that liquor sales in the state would be banned as soon as his government is formed again
 hua bhi kuch vaisaa hi
 On coming to power, the Assembly passed the ban on liquor and liquor sales were completely banned in the state
 haalanki kuch logon ne iske khilaaf adaalat kaa bhi ruukh kiya
 But the government had decided that Bihar has to be alcohol-free
 adaalat main nitish sarkaar kii ore se daleel di gai ki rajya main videshi sharaab par bain bhartiya samvidhan ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar lagaaya gaya he
 Not only this, the state government said in the court that based on the rules, it has been decided by keeping the health of the citizens in mind, and this is the right of the state government
 saal 2016 main bihar sarkaar kaa sharabmbadi par faisla lenaa behad saahasik kadam tha, kyonki iskaa asar sarkari khate main padana lajimi tha
 The government used to get a huge amount of tax from liquor, which was stopped with liquor ban
 vahiin bihar kii janata ne bhi khulkar nitish kaa saath diya, jisase bihar aaj puri tarah se sharaab mukt ho gaya he
 This step of Bihar government in 2016 will be remembered for years

 The operation of security forces in Jammu and Kashmir has shocked Pakistan
 vah ab bhartiya suraksha balon ke khilaaf nai sajeesh rachane main juta hua he
 According to information received from sources till Aaj Tak, Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and its rangers are jointly building a dam on the International Border of Jammu
 pakistan elosi se mahaj 600-700 meter kii duuri par kai piopi ke najadik vah oonche-oonche baandh banane main juta hua he
 a report of this conspiracy has also been given by the security agencies to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 report ke mutabik jammu se sate bharat pakistan seemaa par pakistani rangers mitti se bane oonche baandh bana rahe he
 According to the report, through this dam, Pakistani razors can also carry out a big conspiracy against India
 oonche baandh kii vajah se pakistan rangers or aatankiyon kii harkaton kii jaankaree seemaa par tainaat biguef javaanon ko nahin pataa lag sakegi
 Not only this, Pakistani razors want to avoid bsf's Observation Post by building high dams across the border
 sukhmal ilaake main jis baandh ko banane main pakistani regers lage hue hai wo seemaa se mahaj 600-700 meter kii duuri par he
 The construction of the new dam will make it difficult for the BSF to take infallible action on the Pakistani post, because of the dam they will not be able to see where the Pakistani Rangers are firing at them

 We have eased off lot of regulations: pm@narendramodi— PMO India (@pmoindia)september 2, 2014 Know 8 amazing things about the performance of Indian players in the cricket match between India and England in Australia
 1
 Sashal Dhawan, Sashal Dhawan, the tea was getting cold, so quickly got out like the new king of jokes
 sabase pehle aate hai, sabase pehle jaldi se pavilion chale jate hai
 His wife is from Australia
 hamen laga tha ki sasuraal main kunwar gul khilaaenge
 But here his light is on
 2
 e Kaun is the lull shot of the circle: Virat Kohli
 goyaa gussa hon ki mujhe ab tak vanade main captain kyon nahin banaaya gaya
 Played out irresponsible shot in the second consecutive match
 3
 Raina to go: It is happiness, first sorrow, then sorrow
 suresh raina kii baat kar rahe hai ham
 Got a chance in the last Test
 jiro kaa dabl maaraa
 Then he transferred that panauti to Akshar Patel
 australia ke khilaaf pehle vanade main fifty maari
 So what happened, who was out again
 sabane kaha
 Look Raina returned
 tarif itani hui ki raina aaj phir jaldi se ghar laut aayaa
 He is also against the spinners, who are considered to be efficient in facing them

 Rahul Gandhi Syndrome Victim: Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 unka haal rahul gandhi jaisaa ho rahaa he
 Where everyone is saying, come and show some aggression, some strategy
 or aap hai ki apni hi dhun main mand mand muskuraae ja rahe hai
 There is nothing to do
 bhala koun sa captain gaba kii pich par toss jeet pehle batting karegaa
 Morning weather, helpful for swing
 or tis par turra yah ki aapke bolers aaj kii taarikh main shaayad 500 ran kaa score bhi dephend na kar paaen
 5 Saw, Papa, i said that the only smile of the match today
 mili stuart binni ko
 Everyone was saying papa roger selector
 So Stuart Little also became Hello Roger, Hello Alpha Cumming
 magar stuart aakhri main gusse main dikhe
 Because father's friend Dhoni uncle threw the first over from him
 phir stuart ko samaj aayaa
 This is not a match
 net practice thi
 6
 bhagwaan ke liye mujhe mat marohbhuvaneshwar kumaar, sundar ankhon vaala ladkaa
 Which is helped by swing
 magar madad na ho gai dam pilav ho gaya, jo daure ke aakhri main jaakar pakegaa
 This child's bowling is very rusty here
 ki ab to lagata he ki team main rakhana hi he to specialist batsman ke taur par rakh lo
 7
 packing tagdi, delivery phussahumesh yadav kaa aisa haal he goyaa kisi ne amejon yaa flipcart par trimer order kiya ho or vahaan se ustara bhej diya gaya ho
 It was told that this is the new hope of the bowling team
 videshi fast bolers kii tarah hoos sa dikhataa umesh
 Speed too
 magar ye kya
 Neither line, nor length, nor accuracy, nor wicket, nor economy
 8
 What is this samimo sami
 Seeing it, Uncle ji has come to visit the company garden from a bank job
 wasim akram bataa rahe the ki sami apni batting ko lekar syrius hai
 His number one score 1 run was also told something similar
 magar ham to baat karnaa chaahate hai unki bowling kii
 For which he probably got a job in the team
 kehane ko medium pesar
 But just a few quick balls from Great Kumble
 jo kabhi kabhi swing ho bhi jaati he, to batsman ke paas itnaa vakt hota he ki aaraam se godde tekkar chakka maar sake
 Now three have survived
 patel, raidu or rahane
 Patel's pomp could be done
 aakhir lagaataar do match main golden dak banaaya he
 But they should be given time
 apni bowling ke liye
 Rayudu was abruptly sent to number three
 jaise duulhaa ruuth jaae to devar duulhaa ban jaae tip
 Played well before lull shot
 or rahane
 Looking solid technically
 baaki team india thos nahin thas dikh rahi he
 But there is a trick in it
 world cap se pehle sab tiimon main jeet kii hawa bhar do
 And then do something amazing on the occasion
 tamaam hindustan isi itminan main ji rahaa he

 Be sympathetic to the government
 vah kabhi-kabhi sawaalon ke anokhe jawaab le aati he
 Like installing electric poles in villages to overcome recession and unemployment
 yah pani kii kami dur karne ke liye rail kii patari bichaane jaisaa he
 When the country was waiting for the treatment of recession which came not due to any international disaster but due to the wrong decisions of the government completely, then the festival of planning to distribute electricity connection for free started
 yah skim un rajyon main lagu hogi jahaan bijli vitaran network bure haal main he, bijli board ghate main hai, karj se ubarne kii koshish kar rahe hai or bijli supplai ke ghante gine-chune hi hai
 Governments often forget that in the case of the economy, the dividing line of confidence and conceit is very fine
 desh main vyaapt mandi isi gafalat kii dein he
 But if there is a dilemma after concealment, the risk increases manifold, because then strange decisions like taking medicine in the eye for knee injury are taken
 mandi ke maukey par sabsidi kaa 'saubhaahgya' mahotsav isi duvidha se niklaa he
 The condition of government schemes is bad
 ise khud sarkaar se behatar bhala koun jaanata he
 The government has a ministry which keeps track of the implementation of the schemes
 is saal kii shuruyaat main usne jo report jari kii thi uske mutabik, mote kharch or bajet vaali sarkaar kii 12 pramukh scimen 2016-17 main buree tarah asafal raheen
 For example, the Rural Roads Scheme lagged behind targets in 14 states
 pradhanmantri awaas yojana 27 rajyon main pichad gai
 In this report there is also Deendayal Gram Jyoti Yojana which did not work properly in 14 states
 saubhaahgya yojana isi kaa visataar he
 Jan Dhan is paralyzed after demonetisation
 fasal beemaa yojana ke bare main to sieji ne bataaya he ki iskaa phayda beemaa companiyon ne uthaa liya, kudarat ke kahar ke maare kisaanon ko kuch nahin mila
 Ujjwala, a scheme to provide free gas connections to the poor, is now a victim of dilemma
 kendriya petro companiyon ke kaaran skim kii shuruyaat thik rahi lekin silendar bharwane ke liye 450 rupye dena ujjwala dharakon ke liye mushkil he
 Recession claws are much deeper in rural areas
 kerosine or lakdi har haal main alpiji se sasti he
 States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan have a huge swing in the number of LPG holders and consumption of LPG
 petro mantralay ke research cell kii report bataati he ki ujjwala ke baad yahaan jis raftaar se conection bade hai, us gati se alpiji kii maang yaa khapat nahin badi
 Not only the figures, the attitude of the people is also not very encouraging about the schemes
 is saal agast main india today ke 'desh kaa mizaaj survey' ne bataaya tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii lokapriyata kaa aankada jitna ooncha he, unki skiimon kii alokapriyata utani hi gahari he
 These include big schemes like Jan Dhan, Digital India
 yah sthiti tab he jabaki pradhanmantri desh se lekar videsh tak lagbhag har duusare bhaashan main inkaa naam lete hai or pichley teen saal main in skiimon ke prachaar par record tod rakam kharch hui he
 The Modi government is on the lookout for some big charisma like MNREGA, which can hold the tail and cross the long haul of elections
 dilachasp he ki manaregaa kii safalataa uske jariye mili rojgaron main nahin balki uske jariye badi mazdooree kii daron main thi
 At the time of implementation of MNREGA, the pace of economic development was fast, so the market of wage rates became fully favorable to the workers with the help of MNREGA
 mazdooron ko gaanv main bhi zyada mazdooree mili or shaharon main bhi
 If MNREGA would have come in a time of recession, it might not have got these results
 darasal, sarkari scimen garibi kaa samaadhaan hai hi nahin
 From 1994 to 2012, the number of poor in the total population decreased from 45 percent to 22 percent
 2005 se 2012 ke bich garibi ghatane kii raftaar, isse pichley dashak kii tulana main teen guna tej thi
 It is important to note that this was the period when India's economic growth rate grew the fastest
 ham itihaas se yah sikhte hai ki hamane itihaas se kuch nahin siikhaa
 We also learn from history that governments are the most stubborn in terms of not taking advice

 dashahra ke maukey par aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke gorakshakon kii prashansa vaale bayaan par basapa supremeo mayawati ne tikhi pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki mohan bhagwat ne jo gorakshakon kii prashansa kii he, kya iskaa matlab ye he ki goraksha ke naam par unako ab deshbhar main muslimon or daliton ke utpeedan kaa license he
 Mayawatika says that the Sangh should emphasize Goseva based on service and non-violence instead of cow protection
 mayawati kaa kahana he ki inke dwaara aparaadhik saamaajik or jativaadee hinsak kaaryon kii anekon ghatnaayen saamne hai, uske baavjood bhi aparaadhik tatwon kii tarif karnaa deshhit kaa kaam nahin ho saktaa
 Be it Una Dalit oppression in Gujarat or other BJP ruled states, all such incidents keep coming up
 mayawati ne aarope lagaaya he ki modi sarkaar aane ke baad goraksha ke naam par pehlemusalamaanon koor ab daliton kaa utpeedan kiya ja rahaa he
 Despite this, such a statement by Mohan Bhagwat is not correct
 sapa ko bhi liya aade hathombispi supremeo ne samaajawaadee party or unki sarkaar ko aade haathon lete hue kaha kii samaajawaadee party sarkaar ko aatmachintan karne kii jarurat he ki vah keval naam ke samaajawaadee to nahin rah gaye hai, kyonki samaajawaadee party kaa chaal charitra or cheharaa bilkul bhi samaajawaadee nahin rahaa he

 Where the thief entered the house in the style of Spider man
 jahaan se usne kareeb 60 lakh ke gahanon par haath saaf kar diya
 Actually, the thief reached the balcony first with the help of gas pipeline and then removed the kitchen exhaust fan and entered the house through the window
 40 minute tak karata rahaa chorimamala dilli ke bharat nagar thana ilaake kaa he
 This shocking incident of theft in Rana Pratap Bagh was also captured in CCTV
 chor spidar main kii tarah ghar main ghusaa
 Then broke the lock of the cupboard and cleaned the hands on the jewels kept in the house
 vaardaat ko chor ne kareeb 40 minute tak anjaam diya
 After this, he escaped comfortably
 CCTV footage main kaid chor kii tasvirencisitivi footage dekhne par pataa chalaa ki chor ne ghar main entry karne ke liye gas pipe kaa sahaara liya
 He reached the balcony just like spider-man through a pipe
 sisitivi main dikh rahaa he ki wo chor ghar main ghusaa to genes tishart main tha, lekin jab baahar niklaa to shorts or sir par tauliya daale hue tha
 Then he escaped from there, hiding in a carriage

 vah jewelri mekking karte hai
 Due to this, he took more than 60 lakhs from the jewelery market
 lekin mangalvaar kii subah 4 baje spidar main style main chor ne unke ghar se sara sona saaf kar diya
 If the members sleeping in the house did not believe that bhankanuj's mother, Meenu, took the thief's money from his son
 mangalvaar kii tadake jis samay vaardaat hui, us vakt pehali manzil par anuj ke mata-pita soe hue the
 They did not even get the idea of entering the thief's house
 shaatir chor ne almaari kaa taala todakar na sirf diamond julri, balki unke pushtaini gahanon or 40 hajaar kii nakadi par bhi haath saaf kar diya
 The police is in shock after the incident in search of the accused
 unki police se ek hi maang he ki police unka sara sona or paisa ricover kar sabhi aropiyon ko giraftaar kar le
 Now the thing to be seen is how long the Bharat Nagar Police Station will be able to bring justice to the victims in this case

 64 With my film Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story (2005), i am concerned about my role in ending the 35-year ban on Indian films in Pakistan
 maine us vakt ke pakistani raashtrapati parvej musharraf ko likhaa tha ki na to pakistani or na hi bhartiya hukumat is baat se inkaar kar sakati he ki tajmahal ke banane ke vakt yah mulk saz hindustan tha
 Jahangir is buried in Lahore, his son Shah Jahan in Agra, Nur Jahan in Lahore and his niece Mumtaz Mahal in Agra
 cinema sampark or pyaar kaa sabase acha saadhan he or ise kisi bhi tareeke se roka nahin janaa chahie
 At that time the film was also shown to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Montek Singh Ahluwalia
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki muhabbat ke apane sandesh ke kaaran yah film pakistan ko bhi dikhaai jaani chahie
 i told him that i had already written to the Pakistani President
 hamen apni film vahaan relies karne kii ijaajat mil gai or bhartiya filmon par se pabandi hataa lee gai
 At the invitation of Pakistan, a large delegation led by Tourism and Culture Minister Ambika Soni flew to Pakistan and we were welcomed as heads of state
 uske baad mahesh bhatta kii film najar (2005) dikhaai gai or usne bhartiya filmon ke liye rasta khol diya
 Pakistan has great talent as writers, poets, singers and actors
 magar technology or visheshgyata ke kshetra main ve peeche hai
 He has made some great films
 main nirdeshak shoeb mansoor ko antarrashtriya str kaa maanata hum
 His film Khuda Ke Liye (2007) was brilliant
 mujhe lagata he ki shaan shahid shandaar actor hai
 i have always wanted to make a film with him and i think he has the potential to be a superstar of India
 ali jafar ek anya pratibhashali abhinayta or gayak hai
 Once upon a time, Pakistani TV was engulfed in the hearts and minds of the Indian audience
 mausam, talash, udaan jaise serialon kii baari maang thi
 His writing, acting, music and songs were all of a great quality and people here became accustomed to him
 ek pakistani film jo mujhe yaad he, vah he umrao jaan adaa (1972)
 Unfortunately, we did not get to see very good Pakistani films before watching Bol (2011)
 ali haidar achche kalakaar hai, abdul raashid kadri umdaa abhinayta the or noorjahan to adbhut thim
 As many people as i have till today
 jein suni hai, unamem unki aawaaj sabase sundar thi
 She was acting in films when the two countries were the same, so like Suraiya she too belongs to both of us
 jab pakistan main tajmahal relies hui to band ho chuke cinemagharon ko phir se kholaa gaya or unki marammat hui
 i think the time has come for the distribution network to merge the industries of both the countries to arrange for simultaneous release of films across the border
 agar pakistan main hamaari filmein thik se relies ho paaen to unke vitarakon kii kamai hogi, jiskaa paisa ve apane film udyog main laga sakate hai
 Artists should have no problem in working on both sides of the border
 pakistan ke paas achche lekhak hai, jinka ham istemaal kar sakate hai or ve apni filmon kii gunvattta sudhaarney ke liye hamaare nirdeshkon or takanicianon kii madad le sakate hai
 We use Pakistani talent and they can use our talent
 laud kamedi vaali punjabi filmon kii pakistan main lambii parampara rahi he
 There is also no need for any latest technology, which coupled with lack of money, stopped the development of films in Pakistan
 nirdesan, cinemetography or sound dizin vagairah sikhaane ke liye pakistan ko takanic ke skool kholane kii jarurat he
 The films considered the greatest of the subcontinent were the product of shared India
 bantwaare ke baad pakistani cinema kaa shandaar daur asal main kabhi rahaa nahin jabaki bhartiya film udyog vikaas karata gaya
 Whenever he makes good films, he seldom gets to see us
 vahaan ke film nirmaataa simit darshakon ke saath khush hai
 Bringing his films to India will be an opportunity for him to earn a reputation and a big step towards presenting him to the world

 Surjewala says that there is no transparency in Rafale procurement
 surajevaala ke mutabik, modi sarkaar is saude se rashtriya suraksha ke saath khilwaad kar rahi he
 He claimed that the value of the ships is 526 crores while the deal is worth 1571 crores
 randeep surajevaala ne press conference kar bataaya ki 20 agast 2007 main 126 ladaaku aircraft kharidne ke liye notice jari kii gai thi
 Two companies emerged for this deal
 jinamein se rafel banane vaali company dasolt kaa chayan kiya gaya tha
 The condition of the deal was that 18 Rafale aircraft would be built in France and 108 aircraft would be built in India with the help of the company
 lekin pradhanmantrimodi ne france daureke dauraan 36 aircraft sidhe taur par france se kharidne kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Surjewala raised questions as to why the fighter ships were purchased at an expensive price and why the government is not in favor of transferring Rafale's technology
 sarkaar hindustan aronutics limited ke hit ko darkinar kar nijee companiyon ko phayda pahunchaa rahi he
 Apart from this, Surjewala has also said that the agreement between Dassault Rafale and Reliance has not followed the procedures
