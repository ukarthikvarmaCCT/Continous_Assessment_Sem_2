 The political uproar does not seem to stop after BJP MP Pragya Thakur described Godse as 'patriotic'

 The Lok Sabha Secretariat later issued an official statement saying that Thakur's remarks' have not been recorded
 haalanki bhaajapa saansad pragna thakur ne vivaad badhane ke baad is maamle par safai di he
 Pragya Thakur tweeted that this is a lie, i did not suffer only insult to Udham Singh

 aamir khan kii 'dangal' ke trailor ne record banaaya he to ajay devgan kii 'shivaay' kii bhi khub charchaa he
 Although there is a gap of about 2 months in the release of both the films, they are still caught in each other in such 'dangal'
 
 
 aamir khan or ajay devgan main na to kabhi dosti rahi or na hi dushmani
 In 'ishq', the two were definitely seen doing love together
 lekin ab donon main ek badi takkar ho rahi he
 Recently the trailer of 'dangal' has come, in which he will be seen in the role of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogatake
 isamen vah ek aise pita kii bhoomika main hai jo bahut mahatvakankshi he
 He wants to have a son whom he can train to become a wrestler to win a gold medal for the country
 padhein :salmaan kii 'sultan' se kaise alag he aamir kii pahalwani
 
 
 But there are daughters, that too four
 
 
 jab use ehsaas hota he kibetiyaan bhidesh ke liye medal ja sakati hai to vah unako training dekar ek misaal banaata he
 In the promo of 'dangal', Aamir has many forms as a father
 
 
 ummid, hataasha, niraashaa, khushi, protsaahan, kadaa vyavhaar, pyaar, dulaar, daant
 This is what we all see in my father
 wo apane sapane hamaari ankhon main bharna chaahate hai or hamaare aage badhane ke liye har sambhav rasta bhi kholte hai
 Watch Trailer - In the second trailer of Ajay Devganki 'shivaay', he is very emotional about his daughter and Ajay has tried to remove these emotions from his face and voice
 'shivaay' ke liye yah ajay kaa acha prayaas he
 This is the trailer of 'shivaay' - but if it is compared to his co-star Aamir Khan in 'ishq', then Ajay Devgn's acting looks loud
 vakt ke saath unhone apane abhinay ko bahut taraash he magar phir bhi vah 19 saal pehle ai 'ishk' kii tarah is baar bhi vah aamir ke chehre ke bhaavon ke aage thode fike pad gaye
 Let us now see what will happen in terms of earnings
 
 
 vaise hamen isamen bhi aamir kaa hi palada baari lag rahaa he
 Ajay Devgan has given many superhit films between 'ishq' and 'shivaay'
 lekin'shivaay'kii takkar main karan johar kii'i dil he mushkil'aa rahi he
 There is a lot of controversy about the release of the film, so it is getting publicity accordingly
 vahiin aamir kii'dangal'christmas par aane vaali single relies hogi
 The craze of the film can be gauged from the fact that it has created the record for the most viewed trailer in the first 24 hours on youtube
 phir iske aasapaas koi badi film bhi nahin aa rahi he
 Now let us see whether Ajay Devgan can beat Aamir Khan with the help of 'shivaay' in 'dangal' at the box office

 He said that recently the US has removed some items from the list of increasing tariffs on products imported from China
 china iskaa swaagat karata he
 At the beginning of this month, the US and China have given some concessions to each other
 china sarkaar ne pehle kuch cancer rodhi america dawaaon or kuch anya vastuon ko tarriff se raahat di
 After this, US President Donald Trump welcomed it and postponed the decision to increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods for 15 days
 tab america raashtrapati trump ne twit kar bataaya tha, 'america is baat par raji hua he ki 250 arab dollar ke chini aayaat par tarriff badhaane ke nirnay ko 1 oktober se taalkar 15 oktober se lagu kiya jaae
 'significantly, the US has decided to increase the tariff on Chinese goods from 25 to 30 percent
 china ne 16 tarah ke america utpaadon par pehali baar tex par raahat diya tha

 This could cost the world economy about $ 585 billion
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari haar ke baad samaajawaadee party (sapa) ko muslim vot bank ko sanjoe rakhane kii chintaa sata rahi he
 Party President Akhilesh Yadav is now engaged in an exercise on how to handle this traditional vote bank
 akhilesh kii taiyaari he party sanghathan main pratinidhitiv badhaane ke saath hi alpsankhyakon kii samasyaon ko lekar andolan chalaane kii
 In this campaign to be conducted after the monsoon session of the Legislature, a strategy is being made to remain focused on minorities, backward and farmers
 sutara bataate hai ki pradesh kii jin 12 vidhansabha siton par upachunaav hone hai, unamem se keval ek rampur hi sapa ke kabje main he
 In such a situation, along with retaining Rampur, Samajwadi wants better performance in other seats
 iske sapa mukhiya akhilesh yadav videsh se lautne ke baad lagaataar kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithak kar rahe hai
 There are also seat-wise reviews for the by-election
 raajnneetik vishleshak rajkumaar singh ne bataaya ki basapa mukhiya mayawati ne jis tarah loksabhaa main zyada siten jiti hai, mayawati kii ranneeti he dalit or muslim ko ekatrit kiya jaae
 Muslims feel that Yadav used to join the vote bank only after joining Akhilesh
 agar mayawati ke saath judenge to dalit or muslim kaa acha gathjod hoga
 This will affect Akhilesh's Muslim vote bank
 akhilesh ke saamne basapa se muslim vot bachaae rakhane kii chunauti he
 Akhilesh also has no great Muslim voice left
 ajam hai bhi to vah apane dhang se kaam karte hai
 Rajkumar said that if Akhilesh has to fight a good fight in the by-election, the Muslim vote will have to be saved
 pichhadaa vot bank unase puraa khisak gaya he
 Muslims believe that whoever defeats BJP, he will take his stand on the same side
 mayawati kii aawaaj myne rakhti he, kyonki vah jor-jor se bol rahi hai ki akhilesh daliton ko bhi apane saath nahin rakh paae or muslimon ko bhi nahin sambhaal paae
 In such a situation it is useless to go with SP
 lihaaja, ab akhilesh ke saamne kai tarah kii chunautiyaan hai, jinase unhen nipatna hoga
 Another analyst, Ratnamani Lal, said that both parties of the SP who won in the Muslim are engaged in taking credit for each other
 ab muslim kiski vajah se gathbandhan main gaye, isaki hode main mayawati ne shrey le liya
 Akhilesh came late
 ab vah apane ko muslim hitaishi bataane main jute hai
 This is a follow-up to the bsp's linking of Muslims
 lekin abhi sapa ke liye bahut der ho gai he
 Akhilesh will have to work harder
 unhone bataaya ki muslimon ko lagata he ki sapa ko saath lekar chalane kii himmat mulaayam or ajam kii thi
 Mulayam has become inactive
 ajam ab dilli kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 That is why Akhilesh had realized this
 isiilie unhone vishnu mandir banane kii baat yaa anya mandiron main janaa shuru kiya tha
 This has been passed on to the Muslims, therefore, they can turn to the BSP
 basapa ke ek muslim kaaryakarta ne naam jaahir na karne kii shart par bataaya ki "sapa kaa yadav votbank bhi ab dagamagaataa dikh rahaa he
 Many old leaders who have gone to other parties of the Yadav fraternity are also preferring the BSP instead of returning to the SP
 aise main musalamaanon ko 2022 tak sapa se jodne rakhana aasaan nahin hoga
 "A senior Muslim SP leader said that Muslims' love for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) could not be sustained, as Mayawati, who has compromised with the BJP many times, has no faith
 alpsankhyakon ke liye samaajawaadee party ne bahut kaam kiya he
 That is why there is both stability and attachment of Muslims here
 sapa pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne kaha, 'sapa main muslim padaadhikari bahut pehle se hai
 They are constantly joining us
 koi kahin or nahin ja rahaa he
 SP has always been friendly to minorities

 uttar pradesh kii 80 siton ko is loksabhaa chunaav kaa sabase bada daanv mana ja rahaa he
 The PM contenders of both BJP and Congress parties are contesting from here
 or tisare morche kii saraparasti kaa khwab dekhne vaale samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke mukhiya mulaayam singh bhi yaheen se taal thok rahe hai
 While BJP is engaged in the politics of polarization of non-muslim voters, the Congress, SP and BSP want 18
 5 fisadi musalmaan vot ekamusth na bhi sahi to bade paimaane par unki jholii main aa jaaen
 This equation makes sp's veteran leader Mohammad Azam Khan the most interesting character in the politics of Uttar Pradesh
 ajam khan in dinon sabase zyada charchaa main apane us bayaan se aae jisamen unhone kaha, “kargil kii paharipoon ko kisi hindu ne fatah nahin kiya tha
 Muslim soldiers were the first to go there by putting the slogan 'A Takbir Allah Hu Akbar'
 ” ajam ne gajiabad or mujffarnagar sahit pashchimi uttar pradesh kii kai jansabhaon main yah bayaan doharaaya
 Not only this, in a conversation with India Today, he also accused of adopting double standards on terrorism in the country
 upi ke alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri ne kaha, “mulk ke badshaah (rajeev gandhi) ke hatyare or beant singh ke hatyaron kii faansee kii sajaa maaf kar di jaati he or ek begunaah ko faansee par chadha diya jaataa he
 "does he mean innocent by hanging of Afzal Guru accused of attack on Parliament, then Azam Khan said," Yes, you read the decision of the Supreme Court
 aap bhi jaan jaaenge
 "actually this is Azam Khan's style
 ve thokkar apni baat kehete hai or kai baar tathyon kaa pataa lagane kaa kaam saamne vaale par chhod dete hai
 In this election, they are not giving up any effort from their side which can be helpful in bringing the Muslims towards Azam Khan's leader Mulayam Singh
 aise main media ne ajam ko yah kahkar aade haath liya ki ve sena ko sampradayik rang main rang rahe hai
 But his party did not say a word against him
 do din baad mulaayam singh or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri aakhilesh yadav ne apane mantri kaa bachaav kiya
 Giving a political edge to the matter, the young Chief Minister said, "azam Khan is under attack because Khan is named in his name
" ”darasal ajam khan sapa kii majaburi hai
 He was not in the SP in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the party's seats were reduced to 21 from the 34 seats in 2004
 party main unki gaiyr-maujuudagi main akhilesh kii patni dimple yadav firozabad loksabhaa se upachunaav tak haar gai thim
 This was a big shock to Netaji's politics
 isiilie chunaav ke baad bahut bhavuk maahaul main ajam khan kii sapa main vaapasi, isi din ke liye karai gai thi
 While presenting the tone of his relationship with Mulayam, Azam had said, "then i did not look happily towards happiness, did not look after anyone
 ” or is milan kaa nateeja 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa kii banpar jeet ke rup main saamne aayaa
 But the picture is second in the Lok Sabha elections
 ek taraf bijepi netaa narendra modi kaa hallaa he to duusari taraf mujffarnagar sahit chote-bade 100 se zyada dange sapa sarkaar ke khate main darj hai
 Most of the riots have been killed by Muslims
 aise chot khaae musalamaanon ko sapa ke saath banaae rakhana ajam khan kii sabase badi chunauti he
 If you are not giving a statement like Kargil to do this difficult task, Azam said, "I was told this by an army officer himself
" us afasar ne bataaya ki ranneeti ke tahat muslim sainikon ko sena ne aage kiya
 These soldiers shouted slogans of Alla Hu Akbar, which caused confusion among Pakistani soldiers
 pakistani sainik saamne nikal aae or bhartiya sena ne un par hamalaa bol diya
 "these words of Azam were fiercely attacked by other parties
 hamalaa karne vaale dalon main congress bhi shaamil rahi
 And in the Ghaziabad district where Azam Khan made this statement, BJP candidate and former Chief of Army Staff General V
 ke
 Singh said, "azam Khan is doing dirty politics by dividing the army with religious grounds
 ” lekin is tarah ke sawaalon ko rampur main johar uniwarsity ke chancelar ajam khan ne yah kahkar khaarij kar diya, “agar musalmaan desh ke liye qurbaan hone main sabase aage rahanaa chahta he to isamen bhi aapako dikkat he
 "but his statements can also cause problems for the SP in another way
 ho saktaa he, ye bayaan kuch had tak musalamaanon ko sapa se jodgaye main madadgaar sabit hon, lekin is baat kaa bhi andeshaa he ki kahin baaki voter party se chhitak na jaaen
 Looking at the party's strategy so far, it seems that Mulayam Singh is assuming that Yadav voters cannot part with the party under any circumstances
 lekin modi ne jis tarah hidutv ke saath vikaas kii ganth baandh di he, usamen apratyaashit parinaam saamne aaen to bada achraj nahin hona chahie
 The way all-round competition is in Uttar Pradesh, one vote each is going to prove its worth
 lekin in votaron ko lubhaane kaa kaam to yadav parivaar ko khud hi karnaa padegaa
 That is why Azam's special ally and party's Rajya Sabha MP Chaudhary Munavvar Salim, turning the direction of the whole conversation, instead of looking at it from a communal perspective, advocates seeing it from the perspective of national love
 munwwar kaa tark he, “bijepi kii tangadili kii yah intiha he ki yah musalamaanon kii qurbaani ko bhi vivaad bana detii he
 Khan sahib has only talked about a Muslim who protects the borders
 agar kargil yuddh main musalamaanon kii qurbaani kaa tajakira (charchaa) karnaa gunaah he to yah rashtrawaad kii koun-si paribhaasha he
 "azam is the only leader in SP after Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh to hold the most meetings
 muslim bahul ilaakon main to unki ekal sabhaayen ho rahi hai
 Despite taking off his Rampuri hat and clean shave during the summer, Azam Khan is currently overshadowing leaders with big beards
 do saal pehle kumbh ke meley ke safal aayojan ke liye elahabaad main santon ke haathon sammaan paane vaale ajam khan apane talkh bayanon se ek baar phir sirf muslim netaa kii tarah najar aa rahe hai
 His progressive views are beyond the media cameras and the image of the 1990s is getting louder

 China is continuously increasing its strength
 maheene bhar pehle china ne sainya abhyaas kar duniya ko apni takat kii ek jhalak dikhaai thi
 Now reports are coming that China is going to represent its missiles in the next few days
 12000 kilometre tak maar karne vaali missile ke jariye wo duniya ko apni dhamak kaa ehsaas karana chahata he
 According to sources in the Chinese missile JD, this time on National Day on October 1, China is going to display some missiles that have not yet joined its fleet
 in mixilon ke bare main duniya ko abtak nahin pataa
 No one has even known when and how these missiles were prepared by China
 khabaren tab li hui jab misile ban kar taiyaar hai or jald hi sena main shaamil hone vaali hai
 According to reports from sources of the People's Liberation Army of China, the new fleet of Chinese missiles is going to include long-range to short-range missiles
 inamen sabase ghaatak hogi dongpheng 41 yani deef 41 missile
 The range of this missile is so much that, except for India, many cities of America will also be in the ranks of this missile
 duuri ke hisaab se dekhen to shanghai se los anjalis kii duuri he 6438 mile jabaki deef 41 kii range he 12,000 kilometre yani 7500 mile
 New York is 6945 miles from the western border of China
 jabaki china kii purvi seemaa se sietal kii duuri he mahaj 4,349 mile
 The eastern boundary of Alaska to China is just 2,606 miles
 yani america ke ye saare ilaake aasaani se deef 41 kii range main honge
 New consignments of missiles will be dangerous than before
 Experts claim that the new consignment of China's ballistic missiles will be more dangerous than ever
 range badi hui to he hi, saath hi isaki gati bhi pehle se kahin zyada tej hogi
 Also the target will be more accurate than before
 abhi to sirf ek missile kii hi takanic kii khabar mili he
 Apparently, the new consignment of Chinese missiles has also worried the US
 china in mixilon kis tarah ke shastron se las kiya he isaki abtak koi jaankaree nahin he
 But it is expected that its firepower will be much higher than before
 shaq he ki china ne in mixilon ko parmaanu shakti se bhi las kiya ho
 The capacity of the rest of the missiles joining the Chinese army is not yet known
 intjaar he us parade kaa jab in mixilon ko china duniya ke saamne laaegaa
 Then one can realize how big a threat China is becoming in the race to gain strength
 bharat par dabaav banane kii he koshishavisheshgyon kii maane to china is takat kii numaaish kar bharat par dabaav banane kii koshish bhi kar rahaa he
 The border dispute between China and India has not been resolved
 jaankaron ke mutabik abtak pakistan ke jariye china bharat ko pareshaan karata rahaa he
 But ever since Pakistan's internal situation has deteriorated, China has been trying to intimidate India again and again by showing its military strength
 missile kii taaqat main china bharat se philhal kaaphi aage he
 The Indian missiles will prove to be dwarf in front of the missiles included in China's stockpiles
 chini missile kii range jahaan 12000 kilometre hone vaali he vahiin bhartiya missile kii range mahaj 3500 kilometre he
 In the case of missiles, India is far behind China knows that India is the biggest obstacle in becoming the world's largest power
 isliye mixilon kii dhamak se china bharat ko baar-baar ehsaas karana chahta he ki wo sabase taqatvar he
 India's power seems to be lighter than the missiles
 nai mixilon ke shaamil hone se pehle bhi china kii maarak kshamta or range dono bharat se kahin zyada thi
 The bulk of China is out of range of Prithvi and Agni missiles that India possesses
 zyada duuri tak maar kar paane vaali agni misile abhi yaa to vikaas ke charan main hai yaa phir pareekshan ke
 India's longest range Agni 3 has a range of 3500 km while China's new missile DF-41 can attack up to 12000 km
 brahmos ne badhaai bharat kii takathalaki nausena bede main brahmos ke shaamil hone se bharat kii takat main kaaphi izapha hua he
 This supersonic cruise missile can be launched from any submarine
 isaki maarak kshamta kaa andaja is baat se laagaaya ja saktaa he ki ye 290 kilometre dur tak waar kar sakati he
 The special thing is that it can also easily target planes flying at a height of 10 meters
 udhar china ke paas bharosemand antaramahadwipiya auki madhyam duuri ke mixilon kaa bada jakhira he
 The biggest concern is that all the defense bases of India are under the missiles of China, whereas the missiles of India can attack the cities of China but cannot reach their defense bases
 jaahir he china kii nai misile bharat ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab banenge hi
 The US has a break with China, but the way missile interceptor technology has been successfully tested by India in recent times, the power of Chinese missiles can be thwarted
 par chini mixilon kii kaat agar kisi ke paas he to wo he america
 The US has not only deployed a large number of intercontinental ballistic missiles but also has the technology to fire missiles coming from any corner of the world
 iraq auki afghanistan ke jang main america fouj kii behisaab takat kaa andaja bhi duniya ko mil chukaa he
 Obviously, the increasing proximity of America to India will make China restless
 ho saktaa he yahi vajah he ki pichley kuch saalon se china lagaataar apni sainya kshamta badhaata ja rahaa he
 Equipping his army with new and modern technology and missiles
 shaayad isiilie china faujee abhyaas ke bahaane aksar apni takat kii numaaish karata aa rahaa he
 The motive is to make the same neighbors realize that the dragon is the most powerful

 notebandi or jiesti ne desh main banking ko mahangaa kar diya
 After demonetisation came into force in November 2016, many free services offered by banks were charged
 phir july se lagu jiesti ne in chargees par tex lagaakar aam aadmi ke liye banking seva ko mahangaa kar diya
 When banks in the country said that it is necessary to provide good facilities for increased banking charges, the Reserve Bank said that this will reduce the cost of running the bank
 lekin ab bank graahakon ko kendra sarkaar or arabiai kii daleel raas nahin aa rahi he jiske chalate alag-alag forum par bainkon dwaara vasule ja rahe chargees ko manamaane dhang ke ugaahi tak kaha ja rahaa he
 Due to ever increasing complaints, the Central Government and the Reserve Bank are also seriously considering the matter
 jaaniye kaise ho rahi bainkon dwaara ugaahi- bank branch or atm se simit muft nikasi ke baad khataadharakon se tranjaction charge vasula ja rahaa he
 - Increase in charges for using electronic transfers such as NEFT, RTGS and UPI services - Fees are being charged by the bank for taking a new checkbook after a free checkbook
 - graahakon dwaara mobile wolet kaa istemaal karne par bank fees le rahi he
 - On all these charges, the bank is charging money from customers in the name of GST as well
 ise bhi padhein: GST se mahangaa ho jayega aapkaa credit card bill or insurance premiumaye he bainkon kii safayeeb bank main paisa rakhane par graahakon ko milane vaale byaaj dar main bhi katautee kar bainkon ne apni kamai badha lee he
 In order to justify all these steps, the bank argues that the infrastructure cost is continuously increasing for them
 bainkon ko apni sevaaon kaa vistaar karne kii laagat or maujuuda branches ko chalaane kaa kharch bad rahaa he
 Apart from this, banks argue that there has been a big improvement in banking facility in the country as compared to earlier
 is sudhari hui banking kii laagat ko graahakon ko bhi vahan karne kii jarurat he
 At the same time, banks also argue that transaction charges are not being charged only in India
 duniyabar ke bainkon main graahakon se aise charge vasule jate he
 Dirty debt is the biggest problem of the bank in the debt of customers due to bad credit
 kai dashakon se baikon ke karj or karj maafee se unki sehat kharaab ho chuki he
 The investment of psbs in Infra and Power sector has been submerged, due to which they have 6
 1 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 This loss has also led to the loss of banks' ability to provide new loans to accelerate business
 ise bhi padhein: tranjaction charge se graahak pareshaan, lubhaane main jute kooparative bankvahin sabase zyada duba karj steel, textile, power or inphra kshetra main rahaa he
 It is important to note that if the loans given to these sectors were given to the right companies, then today banks would have got the biggest profit on the interest of these loans and customers could have been given the best facilities at cheaper rates
 lekin ab biimaar pade bainkon ke paas graahakon se dhanaugahi kar apni laagat ghataane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa he

 About 2 months before today, many incidents of children being stolen from Delhi came to light
 wo adhuri thi
 Because the investigation of this case is still going on
 magar aaj ham aapako is kahani kaa puraa sach bataane ja rahe hai
 This is a truth that will make the country think
 kyonki maamla sirf chori bhar yaa mutthi bhar choron kaa nahin he
 Rather it is the theft of the childhood of India and the future of that childhood
 dilli se mahaj 700 kilometre kii duuri par ek ilaaka aisa he, jahaan baqayada bachapan chori ke training camp chalaae jate hai
 The hands of innocent people, the minds of vicious people, know that whenever there is silence between the shehnai in the big cities of the country, then understand that it has been stolen
 shaadi main hone vaali chori se bachane ke liye sicurity guard bhi laga lijie lekin haath kuch nahin lagegaa
 And by the time cctvs are detected, it will be late
 nanhen haathon se saaf kiya gaya wo keemtee saamaan desh ke bihadon se hota hua
 Has reached Gulkhedi village of Rajgarh, MP
 ham isi baat par afsos karte rah jate hai ki zamana bada kharaab he
 Now even children have started stealing
 ab tak bhi agar ankhen nahin khuli hai to khol lijie
 Because even though the hands behind these incidents are of innocent people, the mind behind it is that of vicious people
 naitlakhon main bacchon ko sauda karata he gangashayad hi koi aisi state bachi hogi jahaan inhone chori nahin kii hogi
 See these little children live bachche jinke hote hai vahi un bacchon ko bech dete hai yaa phir theke par dete hai
 Children deal in lakhs of rupees or half the value of stolen goods
 phir ve inase kuch bhi kaam karavaate hai
 Wherever the children are caught, the buyer or contractee states that the children belong to them
 inke saath bade bachche jate hai, jo search karte hai ki kahaan-kahaan shadiyaan ho rahi he
 What is happening where
 usee tarah ke gatap main bacchon ko taiyaar karke vahaan bhej diya jaataa he
 Talking one by one, perhaps you will understand the misdeeds of this syndicate in a much easier way
 dilli ensiaar main darj hai kai maamledo maheene pehle dilli police ke haath paanch aaropee lage the
 It was revealed in these inquiries that this gang operating from Gulkhedi village of MP Rajgarh is actually of All India Level
 or inaki activity itani tej he ki sirf kuch maheenon main hi ensiaar main is gang ne kai darjan vaardaaton ko anjaam de daalaa
 There are 15 cases whose firs are registered
 zahan main ye sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki gang kitna bhi shaatir kyon na ho
 But how can children be attacked? kaise koi gang sirf is bina par falphul saktaa he
 It is certainly surprising
 lekin ye gang jis tarah se kaam karata he
 He is even weirder than that
 gang main kisi bhi bachche ko yun hi shaamil nahin kar liya jaataa he
 Rather, there is a system of recruitment here
 likhit main hota he bacchon kaa contractgang ke log sirf tej tarraar bacchon kaa sellection karte hai
 From their parents, they are either taken on contract or bought
 iske baad in bacchon ko gulkhedi gaanv main training di jaati he
 Then on completion of training, they are stolen from parties and weddings in big cities
 hamane aapako us likhit contract ke bare main bataaya hai
 Which people of this gang do with the parents of the children
 ek sarsari nigaah is contract par daale to usamen likhaa he ki ek paksh duusare paksh ko apane 12 saal ke chote se bete ko bataur advance ek saal ke liye sirf isliye theke par de rahaa he
 So that his son can take away valuable things from the crowd at the wedding parties and there will be an equal distribution of these stolen goods
 bacchon ke asli maa baap tak nahin pahunch paati puliceinake maa baap khud inke pakade jane kaa dar rahata he
 They think they will be trapped
 bachche ko theke par dene ke baad gang kii jimmderi ho jaati he
 When caught, the police are unable to locate or verify the real parents
 police ko pataa nahin chalata ki vastav main ye bachche kiske hai
 When the police go to the village, then anyone stands there with the village's voter list whether the child is here or there
 lekin ye log funsate he lau kii texicality main
 This work can be done very well, but the relief for the child is that he is soon left
 jaldi jamaanat bhi ho jaati he
 Advantages of stealing from children: These vices have many advantages in stealing from children
 to bas ginate jaaiye un phaaydon ko jo is gang ko nanhen bachche kara sakate hai
 It is easy for children to enter any party
 ye mahilaon main aasaani se shaamil ho jate hai
 It is also easy for children to steal
 kisi ko bacchon par shaq bhi nahin hota
 Children get beaten up when caught
 bal aparaadhiyon kaa kaanoon bhi behad udaar he
 Children are sent to remand homes instead of jail
 vaardaat karke nikle to pakadana mushkipub chunki ye kaam behad bade paimaane par or systematic tareeke se hota he
 So the gang also works in a full proof manner
 chori ke liye shaadi yaa party main bhejne se pehle bacchon ko taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 They are often dressed in expensive clothes
 taaki shaq kii gunjaaish koi na ho
 On the occasion, the gang's cars are in ready condition so that as soon as the incident happens, they can be relieved and if the children are caught then they have lawyers in every city to rescue them
 magar ek baar ye vaardaat karke nikal gaye to phir inhen pakad paanaa vaaki main mushkil hi nahin naammumkin ho jaataa he
 Gulkhedi fails in the village
 The law police know where these children came from
 inhen kisne training di he
 And who is running the gang
 magar phir bhi police gulkhedi jaakar bebas ho jaati he
 Actually, police station statistics show that about 5 dozen warrants have been lying here for months, which was not served and there is hardly any police of the country who have not come here to catch the accused, but with as much warmth as they are here She comes
 utani hi maayoos hokar khaali haath laut jaati he
 i do not know what happens that the court decree fails and the law remains helpless after stepping on the door of Gulkhedi
 gaanv main khuleam hota he lakhon kaa juajaha police nahin ghus paati vahaan hamaare liye ghus paanaa to zaahir he behad mushkil tha
 Right with the intelligence camera but till date tried this
 hamaari team jaananaa chaah rahi thi ki aakhir kya he is gaanv main ki police yahaan aakar bebas ho jaati he
 
 logon se baat karke vajah jaanane ke alaava hamaare paas chaara bhi koi tha nahin
 But in our intelligence camera, we could record someone's conversation
 usase pehle hi usamen ajibo-garib tasviren record honi shuru ho gayi
 In the street, gambling houses were running
 jidhar dekho udhar taash kii gaddiyaan pis ja rahi thim
 Thousands of new currency notes were won for victory
 puure gaanv ko khullamakhulla caseenon bana diya gaya tha
 Hundreds of people were standing and playing the opener to neutralize the rules and regulations
 police ko maar ke bhaga dete hai graminwajah jaanane kii koshish kii gai to sach puuchhie halaat jaanakar bura laga
 a person named Dev Narayan of the village told ‘what will the police do
 police kuch nahin kahati he
 Police will be caught
 police kya kar legi
 The police has been beaten up several times
 yahaan police nahin aati he, yahaan police-woolis kii dhamkee nahin chalati
 Many bars are lying, many bars are flexing
 yahaan darataa varataa koi nahi he
 'when he was asked that this was illegal work, his answer was that who is watching if it is illegal
 kya kar legaa koi
 This is a strange village jo he to hindustan main magar uskaa kanoon yahaan chalata nahin
 If law does not have a place here, then whose is it moving here
 local police leti he paisaaj tak ke camere main jo ricard hua wo bol to nahin sakate magar aapako suna sakate hai
 So listen, who is walking in this village of MP, which has become a headache for the police of the whole country
 thane kaa esechao kahata he 'haa kya karnaa he kya nahi karnaa he zyadattar maamalon main police paisa leti he paisa liya or chali gai
 It has been eight-nine months since i came, i have not seen that the police have laid siege to anyone and captured someone
 'baahar ke log aakar khelte hai jua or pite hai sharabsirf jue ke adde chal rahe hon to phir bhi ganimat he
 But here all the evil deeds of the world are teasing the books of law
 ek taraf ye gaanv juaariyon kaa adda he to duusari taraf sharaabiyon kii sabase pasandida jagah bhi
 Expensive liquor is also available here at half the price at illegal liquor shops
 or to or jam se jam takaraane ke bhi yahaan tamaam intazaam he
 You will not feel like in the village that you are roaming in a country where alcohol and gambling are banned in the open
 gaanv ke purv sarampach se hamane is masale par baat karne kii koshish kii
 So his argument was even more strange

 BJP leader Virendra Singh who participated in the protest said that it is condemnable to have such thinking about Maharana Pratap
 maharana pratap ne jangal main ghaas kii roti khai thi or is tarah se shiksha mantri kaa bayaan kii maharana pratap or akbar mahaan koun he; pataa lagaayenge, sharmnaak he

 peeth ne iske saath hi is maamle ko teen disbanr ko sunwaayee ke liye soochibaddh kar diya he
 The bench said that these allegations need to be investigated afresh as the earlier report of the committee was not in line with the apex court's order due to time lapse
 sheersh adaalat kashmir ghati main gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se naaballigon ko kathith rup se hiraasat main liye jane kaa mudda uthaane vaali ek yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 After hearing the arguments of the child rights activists and the lawyers of Jammu and Kashmir administration, the bench said that the work assigned to the committee was not done as per the spirit of the order of the apex court due to timeliness
 peeth ne kaha ki sheersh adaalat kaa 20 sitambar kaa aadesh samiti ke paas 23 sitambar ko pahunchaa tha or do din baad jammu kashmir police ke mahanideshak ne media or yachika main is bare main kiye gayi daavon or aaropon kaa 25 sitambar ko sire se khandan kiya
 The report of the committee also included the findings of the Additional Director General of Police, which denied the allegations of illegally detaining juveniles in Kashmir

 When Ahmadi was presenting his arguments on Tuesday, the bench drew attention to the objectionable language used about the members of the committee and said that these would have to be withdrawn
 ahmadi ne is suzav se sahmati vyakt karte huye kaha ki vah ek halafanama daakhil karke inhen waapas le lenge
 The bench said that the members of the four-member committee are judges and the use of such words about them cannot be accepted
 peeth ne kaha ki samiti kii apni simaayen hai or shaayad sadasyon ke paas samay kii bhi kami thi
 The bench reminded the senior advocate that when the matter first came up for hearing, the petitioners claimed that the High Court could not be reached for justice
 is par pradhan nyaayadhish ne ucch nyaayalay se report maangi thi
 Attorney General KK Venugopal, who was present during the hearing of the case, asked the Juvenile Justice Committee report
 venugopal ne kaha ki is maamle main jammu kashmir prashasan ke saath kendra bhi prativaadee he or uskaa drushtikon prashasan vaala hi he
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta requested to adjourn the hearing of the case but the bench said that such an important case cannot be delayed
 mehta kaa kahana tha ki yachikakarta kanoonee prakriya kaa durupyog kar rahe hai or unhen sheersh adaalat kii bajaaye ucch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kerani chahie thi
 He said that the petitioners had earlier made a false claim in the apex court that the High Court was not functioning
 unhone kaha ki is yachika ko lambit nahin rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki ucch nyaayalay raahat ke liye uplabdh he or kishor nyaay samiti kaam kar rahi he

 Teams have made a number of rules related to sports and discipline for their players, which are very similar
 lekin is mahaaayojan ke dauraan shaareerik sambandhon ko lekar tiimon or khilaadiyon ko alag-alag tarah ke niyamon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 For example, the players of Costa Rica cannot be in bed with their wives, girlfriends or anyone else before the second round
 brazil ke khilaadiyon ko apni patniyon yaa pramikaaon ke saath hambistar hone kii chhot to he, lekin unase kaha gaya he ki ve shaareerik kshati (injuri) ko lekar saavdhaan rahen
 Nigerian players can only be with their wives during the World Cup
 rus, mexico or bosnia va harjegovina ne apane khilaadiyon ke liye vishwa cap ke dauraan sex par pratibandh laga rakhaa he
 However, no team participating in the World Cup is officially bound by the rules
 har team ne iske baavjood apane liye varjit kshetra tay kiya he
 Coaches felt that players would be more tired of sex, so at their level they made new rules to protect them from this fatigue
 quartz website ke mutabik germany, spain, america, australia, italy, netherlands, switzraland, urugve or england ne haalanki khilaadiyon par sex ko lekar koi khaas tarah kaa pratibandh yaa pabandi nahin lagaai he
 Coaches believe that if players are doing justice to their ability on the field, then they should not be stopped from this natural action
 rus, chile, mexico or bosnian tiimon ne haalanki sex par puri tarah roak laga rakhi he
 According to the website, the coaches of these teams believe that their players field all the 'fristation' related to their sex, because they have come here for this purpose
 mexico ke coach miguel herera ne kaha, ‘40 dinon tak shaareerik sambandh nahin banane se duniya ulat-pulat nahin jaaegi
 If a player cannot live without a physical relationship for a month or 20 days, then he is not fit to be called a professional
 'brazil, costarika, france, nigeria jaisi tiimon ke liye haalanki maamla jatil he
 Brazilian coach Luis Philippe Scolari does not abstain from sex for a bit, but does not want players to harm themselves in the process of a physical relationship
 scolari jaanate hai ki 2006 main unki team ke star khilaadi ronaldinho par sex or pies2 kaa bhoot savaar tha or isi kaaran unki team ko quarter final se baahar kaa rasta dekhnaa padaa tha
 Sex is not banned for the French team, but its players cannot stay in it all night
 team ke doctor maanate hai ki sex khilaadiyon ke liye acha he, lekin isamen raat-bhar lage rahanaa nuksaandaayak he
 Nigerian team players may be bedridden with their wives, but not with girlfriends
 costarika ke khilaadiyon ke liye sex duusare daur main pahunchane kaa puraskaar he
 If they reach the second round, they will have an open leeway
 america or australian tiimon kaa daawa he ki unke paas khilaadiyon ke sex life par sochane ke alaava kai anya ahm mudde he
 There is no restriction on English team

 ateet ko lekar acchhee baat yah he ki yah gujri baton ke akalan kaa mauka detaa he
 Now that the year 2011 has seeped into the pages of history, the mention of Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda is among the celebrities of the year
 ve saal bhar jharkhand ke liye har jaruri vichaar ko moort rup dene kii koshishon main jute rahe hai
 Since assuming the Chief Minister's chair in September 2010, Munda has been equipped to do something
 us samay koi is baat kaa andaja tak nahin laga saktaa tha ki ateet main kushasan kaa paryaay ban chukaa jharkhand unke netritv main saal bhar main sushasan sambandhi kadamon kii nayab misaal banakar ubharegaa
 This year is the story of Munda's achievements
 jharkhand 30 agast ko electronic madhyamon ke jariye janasevaayen pradaan karne kaa kanoon banane vaala desh kaa pehla rajya ban gaya
 If you are in Jharkhand, then public services like income, caste and housing certificate can reach you through internet
 jharkhand ke nakshekadam par chalate hue 'bade bhai' bihar ne bhi pehali disambar se electronic madhyamon ke jariye janasevaayen muhaiyaa karaane kaa kadam uthaaya
 Jharkhand has become the fourth state in the country where the 'right to Service' Act is in force
 iske tahat sarkari adhikari ek nishchit samay seemaa ke andar janasevaayen pradaan karne ke liye baadhya hai
 Throughout the year, he appeared as a committed man
 sadakon kaa jayja lene ke liye doordaraj ke ilaakon kaa daura karne se lekar janata ke saath sidhaa sampark saadhane ke liye kol centre tak kii ruparekha banane tak, munda rajya main preranadai or bharosemand prashasan kaayam karne ke liye sakriy rahe hai
 They have emerged as someone who believes in work rather than slogans
 ve apane lakshya main isliye bhi kaamyaab hue ki unhone seekhney kii pravriti lagaataar banaae rakhi
 "they look at our proposals carefully," says a senior IAS officer of the state
 ve vikaas lakshyon par chart or prajentation ke jariye vichaar-vimarsh karte hai or behatar prashasan ke kram main lagaataar seekhney ko utsuk rahete hai
 "his talent for producing positive results in spite of all kinds of turmoil makes him different from his contemporary leaders
" 15 november, 2000 ko jharkhand ke astitv main aane ke baad se hi is rajya main tamaam sarkarein sankatagrast rahi hai
 In 11 years, the state has seen eight governments in addition to two rounds of President's rule
 ye tamaam sarkarein nihit swaarthon vaale sahyogi dalon ke samarthan-vaapasi ke khataron ke saae tale jhulati raheen
 The Munda government is also no exception to this
 badtar yah ki munda sarkaar ko aise vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he jo apane nihit swaarthon ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane ko taiyaar rahete hai or 'malaaidaar' padon ke liye baichaiyn rahete hai
 Munda does not believe in making them happy
 is tarah kii visham paristhitiyon main bhi munda ne aise kai kadam uthaae hai jinase unka kad or badha he
 Many of his decisions could have been extremely risky and destabilizing the government
 mandu upachunaav main sattarudh gathbandhan kii jeet munda ke netritv kaushal kaa sabase bada saboot he
 He did not field BJP candidates in this by-election
 apni sahyogi ajasu ko bhi aisa karne ke liye manaa liya
 Then decided to support the JMM candidate at the expense of his most trusted and a decade old ally Janata Dal (united)
 yah faisla us samay sahi sabit hua jab jad(you) pratyaashee kii jamaanat jabt ho gai or jhamumo ummidavaar kii jeet hui
 However, everything did not go their way
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad unke dwaara khaali kii gai jamshedpur sansadeey seat par upachunaav main bhaajapa kii haar unke liye sabase bada jhatka thi
 As 2011 progressed, Munda emerged as someone whom opponents also respect
 jharkhand pradesh congress samiti ke adhyaksh pradeep balmuchu kehete hai, ''unamem sabhi tarah ke logon ko manage karne kii kshamta he
 But people with opposite ideologies are running their government for personal interests
 ''unhone satta-santulan kaa behtareen namoona pesh karte hue gathbandhan sarkaar ko gati di
 Munda, who replaced Babulal Marandi in 2003 under the pressure of 5 JD (U) ministers, is the most trusted face of the BJP in the state
 mukhyamantri ke rup main yah unka teesraa kaarykaal he
 He has not tasted the post even for five years once
 jharkhand kii ukhaad-pachhad kii raajnneeti main munda kaa tike rahanaa bhi ek uplabdhi he

 Jaswant Singh, who was appointed as the vice-presidential candidate on behalf of the opposition coalition NDA, said he would try to garner support from non-nda parties, including the Trinamool Congress, a constituent of the UPA

 Many diseases are eliminated by drinking water kept in a copper vessel and many diseases are not able to flourish in the body
 par aisa nahin he ki tambe ke bartan main turant pani rakhaa or pi liya
 There will be no benefit from this
 agar tambe ke bartan main rakhe pani kaa phayda lenaa he to ise kam se kam chah se aath ghante kaa samay den yaa phir raat ko rakhkar subah pien
 Keeping water in a copper vessel brings all the properties of copper to water

 Let me tell you, since being nominated for the Oscars, there is a daily controversy about it
 pehle kaha gaya ki ye irani film sikret ballat kii copy he
 However, Newton's director has denied such allegations
 ab nayaa khulaasa saamne aayaa he iske poster ko lekar
 It is being said that the poster of this film resembles Satyajit Ray's film Ganashtru
 film ko lekar uthe aise sawaal auskar aword main bhartiya daavedaari ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 For these 7 reasons 'newton' should get Oscar story of Newton, the story of the film is of Nutan Kumar (rajkumar Rao) who has changed his girl's name by writing 'newton' in the tenth board
 ab sabhi log use newton ke naam se hi jaanate hai
 Newton has studied msc in physics
 chunaav ke samay uski duty lagati he
 He has to go to the naxal-affected area of the forest to get voting
 vahaan jane par use pataa chalata he ki vahaan sirf 76 voters hai, lekin voting vaale din koi nahin aata
 In such a situation, what Newton does and how much the situation changes is the main climax of the film

 com / vvwxhlmw1r Shortly after Arvind Kejriwal was accusing Kejriwal of Nitin Gadkari of grabbing the land of the farmers, the BJP leaders held two press conferences and rejected it outright and raised the credibility of Kejriwal and India Against Corruption
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne kaha mujhe ghotaale main ghaseetna saraasar durbhagyapurna he
 He said that the land which was later to be given to the charitable trust was leased 11 years ago
 unhone khud ko ghotaale main ghasite jane ko durbhagyapurna qaraar dete hue kaha, ‘main ghotaale par chup hum, aisa nahin he
 i have worked to provide employment to 10 thousand rural youth
 main sinchai ke liye lagaataar sangharsh karata rahaa hum
 i have been fighting for Vidarbha's irrigation problem
 mujhapar ye sabhi aarope raajnneetik swaarth ke tahat lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Sushma also attacked Kejriwal Shortly after this, BJP leaders Opposition Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley met the press
 sushamaa swaraj ne arvind kejariwal ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya
 He said, 'for the last several days, an atmosphere was being created in the media that very soon some big disclosure would be made against the BJP and many dates were set aside for this revelation
 khabaron ko bam kii tarah parosa ja rahaa tha ki kisi bijepi netaa ke khilaaf kejariwal karenge khusaala or hamaara shaq sahi niklaa ki bahut praytn karne ke baad bhi ek bhi aarope bijepi kii ore nahin laga
 He took the names of all the parties he remembered
 sabhi ko kathghare main khadaa kiya
 He did not just ask for votes for himself
 ’unhone nitin gadakari ke anjali damania se hui baatcheet par tippanee karte hue kaha ki nitin gadakari se kabhi anjali kii baat hi nahin hui he
 Significantly, the India Against Corruption has revealed that the land given to Nitin Gadkari was the farmer's farmland which was acquired from him
 sushamaan ne diya aaropon kaa diya javabsushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki iasi ke aarope galat hai kyonki wo ek banjar jameen thi
 There Nitin Gadkari grew the sugarcane plant which was given to the farmers at cheap prices
 sushamaa ne kaha, ‘jis jameen kii baat ho rahi he vahaan nitin ji kheti kar rahe hai jahaan ganna ugaai jaati he
 By growing sugar cane sapling there, Nitin ji is giving it to the farmers for just Rs 5 while its market value is Rs 13
 ’iske baad sushamaa swaraj ne iasi ke duusare aaropon kaa jawaab diya jisamen gadakari par baandh ke pani ko nitin gadakari kii jameen kii ore modane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Sushma said, 'that land was acquired in 1983-84
 1996 main usapar baandh ban gaya
 The iac's allegation that the farmers were farming on it is absolutely baseless
 yahaan tak ki vahaan ke kisaanon ko muaavja mil chukaa he
 There was a barren land where farming was not being done
 ’sushamaa ne bataaya, ‘baandh ke pani kaa nitin ji ke plant ko milane vaali baat par hamaara kahana he ki baandh kaa keval 0
 Only 85 percent of the water is available
 isliye kejariwal ke is khulaase se khud unpar hi sawaal uthne lage hai
 This only puts a question mark on his credibility
 ’jetali ne IAC kii vishwasaneeyata par uthaaya savajerun jetali ne samvaadadaataaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki kejariwal bhrashtachar sabit nahin kar sake kyonki gadakari ne sabhi kaary niyamon ke anusaar kiye hai
 He said, 'today's press conference was mainly an election stunt
 yah puri tarah se bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne kaa vifal prayaas tha
 It is completely baseless to put BJP together with Congress in the case of corruption
 ’jetali ne iasi kii vishwasaneeyata par prashn uthaate hue kaha, ‘jab koi sanstha jo khud ko crusyder kahati he to khud uski vishwasaneeyata bahut jaruri he
 Today India Against Corruption has eroded its credibility with civil society
 aaj unhone ‘hit main’ vaala kaam kiya jo kisi par bhi prahaar karata he
 Jaitley told, 'nitin ji has put sampling on the ground
 yah jameen 11 saal ke liye lij par mili he
 It is wrong to find the angle of any political conspiracy
 ye jo aarope lagaae hai inako purna rup se bhartiya janata party khaarij karti he
 Jaitley said, 'his charge that the farmers were farming there is utterly wrong
 jameen kaa kuch hissaa banjar he
 Farming is closed there
 kisaanon kii behatari ke liye agar sarkaar kisi jameen ko power plant ko detii hai to isamen koi galat yaa gaiyrkanoonee baat nahin he
 All the land of the country where a building stands today was cultivated at some time
 ’kul milakar bijepi ne apane rashtriya adhyaksh main puraa vishwaas jataayaa he or kejariwal ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij kar diya

 Chidambaram said that i want to clarify the position of Congress that we are not against the bill, just want answers to some questions
 purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram's question: We want clarification about clause 5,6
 sarkaar is baat ko spasht kare ki agar aap ek vyakti ko aatanki ghoshit karte hai, to wo koun-sa stage hoga, jab aap kahenge ki wo aatanki he? kya wo bina poochtacha ke hi aatanki ghoshit kar diya jayega?grih mantri amit shah kaa jawaab:kuch aatanki aksar videsh bhaag jate hai, aise main unase poochtacha karke aatanki ghoshit karnaa mushkil hoga
 If this happens, we will not be able to declare Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim as terrorists, the UN will do it but we will not be able to
 isliye aisa karnaa pad rahaa he
 Also, Amit Shah said that as long as the person is available for questioning, then only after proof-inquiry he will be declared a terrorist

 Writers are philanthropists, who favor the editors throughout their lives, and die on all the things from which they will no longer be able to borrow

 The younger writer has to hide because he is not printed
 chote lekhak kii chintaa bhi choti rah jaati he
 Photo is the first condition to print

 There are no expressions on the face

 If the photo is black and white, then the man seems to be a big writer
 kuch to lekhak aise hai ki digital ke jamaane main photo blike and white khinchaa print chaay ke cap main dubaakar bhej dete hai
 It is said that if the photo looks old, then the next senior writer understands
 lekhakon ke chashmen bhi unhen alag hi str par le jate hai
 Yashpal looked through glasses
 bhagwaticharan verma chashme main upar se
 Look at the photo, you seem to be asking, "how are you here today?" So to be a writer one needs glasses
 kisi lekhak ko aapane contact lens lagaae dekha he kabhi? lekhan suhaag he to chashma suhaag kii nishaani
 If you ever want to read your written eyes and burst your eyes, first blow the glasses
 so majboot peeth ho
 Thick skin
 ek bhavaheen chehre vaali photo
 Lots of credit
 ek chashma
 Just humans
 insaan se lekhak ban saktaa he
 Yes, if you write a little bit

 And such children work hard day and night in their newspapers to print the crime being done on the children

 khabaron ko likhane ke liye editor bhi hai jo kii computer par khabaren likhte hai
 Today, even though people do not know the newspaper of these children, but these children work with dedication and hard work and print the crime of children in this newspaper
