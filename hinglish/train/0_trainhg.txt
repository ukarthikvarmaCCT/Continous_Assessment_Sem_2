 desh kii desh kii teesri pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii aaj 101veen jayanti he
 It would not be wrong to say that Indira was a woman with harsh decisions
 vah prabhavi vyaktitv vaali mridubhashi mahila thim or apane kade se kade faislon ko puri nirbhayata se lagu karne kaa hunar jaanati thim
 Let's know about the tough decision of Indira
 
 
 
 Indira had inherited power, but those circumstances were very difficult
 indira vipaksh ke nishane par thim, yahaan tak kii unhen goongi gudiya tak kah diya gaya
 But Indira showed stars to her opponents during the day itself
 goongi gudiya kehane waalon kii bolti band kar di
 Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister after the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, but there was a revolt in the party
 morarji desai party ke faisle se naaraaz ho gaye
 Although Morarji Desai and Indira's figures were always thirty-six, Indira made Morarji Desai the Deputy Prime Minister
 indira gandhi: fauladi iraadon or nidar faislon vaali desh kii pehali mahila pmpraxanamamwri banane ke baad indira bahut sahaj nahin thim
 She wanted to avoid speech and debate in Parliament
 kam bolti thim
 In 1969, he was to present the budget, then Indira was so scared that there was no sound coming out of her mouth
 indira gandhi ke nijee chikitsak rahe dow capi maathur ne apni kitaab 'da ansin indira gandhi' main kaaphi kuch likhaa he
 Indira remained under great stress for one or two years after becoming Prime Minister
 wo un kaaryakramon main asahaj mahasoos karatin or unase bachane kaa prayaas karatin jahaan unhen bolnaa hota tha
 Due to this nervousness, their stomach used to get upset or their head started to ache
 indira kii is asahajata par vipaksh hameshaa hamalavar rahaa
 Ram Manohar Lohia even called Indira a 'dumb doll'
 indira gandhi do-do morchon par lard rahi thim, vipaksh ke tikhe tewaron se to wo nipat bhi letin, lekin party ke bheetar kii baghawat ne unki naak main dam kar rakhaa tha
 Meanwhile, Indira also took many revolutionary decisions
 
 
 
 These were his revolutionary decisions - On 19 July 1969, Indira nationalized 14 big banks
 jo banking sevaayen bade vyapaariyon or kisaanon tak hi simit thim ab wo desh kii aam janata or aam kisaanon tak pahunchane lageen
 Indira formulated a land reform policy for the landless and weaker sections of the society
 - indira ne harith kranti ko badhaava diya
 The result was that earlier where India had to import food grains from America, India started exporting food grains
 - party main aae din kichakich ko dekhte hue indira ne alag rasta le liya
 The Congress was divided
 morarji desai ne congress o bana liya
 Indira formed Congress R, later renamed Congress Eye
 - 1971 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main indira ne garibi hataao kaa naaraa diya
 - During the campaign he covered 36,000 miles and addressed 300 gatherings
 - indira kii aandhi chali, congress ai ne 352 loksabhaa siten jitkar prachand bahumat vaali sarkaar banaai
 - Morarji Desai's Congress o had to satisfy only 16 seats
 nehru ne jail main rahete hue beti indira ko kitne khat likhe?
 
 
 Pakistan's biggest mistake was the period when the army of Pakistan in East Pakistan made the lives of common people alive
 pakistan ke sainik taanashaah yahaya khan ne 25 march 1971 ko purvi pakistan kii janabhaawanaaon ko sainik takat se kuchalane kaa aadesh de diya tha
 After this, Sheikh Mujid was arrested
 purvi pakistan se sharnaarthi bharat aane lage
 The nefarious activities of Pakistan were increasing
 3 disambar 1971 ko indira kolkata main ek jansabha kar raheen thi
 In the evening of the same day, Pakistani Air Force planes crossed the Indian air border and bombed military airports of Pathankot, Srinagar, Amritsar, Jodhpur and Agra
 indira ne thaan liya ki pakistan ko sabak sikhaanaa he
 
 
 
 or badal gaya pakistan kaa bhugolbhartiya sena ne pakistan ko karaara jawaab diya
 The fight ended in 13 days
 16 disambar ko hamaari sena ne pakistan ke 93 hajaar sainikon ko bandi bana liya
 Indira changed not only the history of Pakistan, but also the geography
 purvi pakistan aaazaad ho gaya
 At the initiative of Indira, Bangladesh became a new country
 jiske raashtrapati bane shaikh mujibil rahamaan
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee at that time called Indira even the avatar of Durga
 
 
 
 When the whole world saw India's strength, Indira was engaged in making India a new superpower
 18 may 1974 ko indira ne pokharan main parmaanu pareekshan karwaakar puri duniya ko apni takat kii dhamak dikhaai
 Indira, who had received the title of 'gungi Doll', had now become 'the Iron Lady'

 aise alag hua elosi or piokeis jang ke baad kashmir kaa masalaa sanyukt raashtra main pahunchaa
 After which the ceasefire was announced on 5 January 1949
 tay hua ki sijafire ke vakt jo senaayen jis hisse main thim use hi yuddh viraam rekha mana jaae
 Which is called LOC
 is tarah kashmir kaa kuch hissaa pakistan ke kabje main chalaa gaya jise aaj pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) kaha jaataa he
 Which includes Gilgit, Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, Baltistan
 1947 se shuru hui kashmir par kabje kii jangkashmir ko jakhmi karne vaali is vaardaat ko aaj kareeb 70 saal ho gaye hai
 Pakistan is still not deterred by its antics
 puure kashmir par kabje ke liye shuru hui 1947 se ye jang ab bhi jari he
 The loc streak was lifted in 1949 after the ceasefire was announced
 yahaan tak ki uske baad pakistan se lagane vaali tamaam sarhadon par jo senaayen tainaat kii gayi wo aaj tak kaayam hai
 From 1949 to 1965, Pakistan used to crack down on Kashmir to grab it
 bhartiya sena ne pakistan ke mansoobon par pheraa paniazadee ke baad ek taraf hindustan tarakkee kii nai oonchaaiyaan chhu rahaa tha to vahiin duusari taraf pakistan ne apni sari takat duniyabar se hathiyaaron ko batorne main juta rakhi thi
 Pakistan did not falter even after a bitter defeat from India and in the guise of Kashmiri jihadis, they surreptitiously rammed their army personnel into the hills of Kargil
 lekin oparation vijay chalaakar bhartiya jambaajon ne dushman ke napak mansoobon par pani pher diya
 However, due to the height of the hills, the Indian army was facing many difficulties in facing the Pakistani terrorists
 lekin bharat ne topon kii garaj ne dushman ke hausale post kar die
 On 26 July 1999, Indian troops drove Pakistani intruders from Kargil

 Uttar Pradesh Police has registered a case on Tuesday and arrested Mahant

 hamaare desh main karodon log janvitaran pranali yani sarkari rashan kii dukaan se chaaval gehun lete hai
 The government gives them cheap food grains under various schemes
 kai baar hamen lagata he ki sab thik hi chal rahaa hoga kyonki sarkaar bhi ek line main sari baaten kah detii he ki ab mashin se rashan mil rahaa he, isliye chori band ho gai he
 The one who deserves it is getting it and there is huge savings in the government exchequer
 aisa ho bhi saktaa he lekin duusari taraf jahaan log qatari main khadey hokar rashan kii dukaan khulne kaa intjaar kar rahe hai unke saath yah mashin kaisaa vyavhaar kar rahi he, ham nahin jaanate hai
 If the leakage has stopped then what would have passed on those who were not found
 tivi ke bahut se shahari darshak jamaane se rashan kii dukaan par nahin gaye honge
 i meet many of my viewers who go
 magar unke paas fasebuk or twitor nahin he jo apana haal twit kar saken
 You must have seen a machine similar to the ration machine in the shops and malls of the cities, where you give money from your debit card and credit cart
 vaise iskaa angreji naam 'point of cell' mashin he
 This is called a pos machine
 rajasthan sarkaar ne apni yojana ke prachaar ke liye iskaa naam 'bhamashah atm' rakh diya he
 This machine first reads the Aadhar card, then the thumb impression has to be given
 nishaan milegaa tabhi mashin aadhaar card ke sarwar se milan karegi ki vyakti asli he
 Now if the card is correct, then the machine will know from another server in Jaipur from the same base where the information of the ration card holders is there
 jab donon jagahon par pushti ho jaati he to anaaj milegaa
 Otherwise the machine will say time out, ie you will not get it
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is mashin se kranti aane vaali he kyonki rashan kii dukaanon se chori ruk jaaegi, sarkaar kii karodon kii sabsidi batch jaaegi
 The person who is entitled will get the grain
 is mashin ke aane se pehle bhi chhattisgarh or anya kai rajyon ne apane yahaan rashan kii dukaanon se licage ko rokane kaa daawa kiya tha
 We read them very much
 ab yah sawaal to niti niyantaa hi bataaenge ki jab vah tarika safal ho saktaa tha to is tareeke kii jarurat kyon pad rahi he
 There is a question of the cost of the machine, the company and the contract, but we do not know about it, so there is no speculation
 vaise iconomik times kii 2012 yani chaar saal pehle kii report he, jisamen nandan nilekani kaa bayaan he ki aisi har mashin kii ausat keemat 15 hajaar rupee hogi
 We thought why not go and see what the poor people, ordinary people experience when they go to this machine
 abhi tison din rashan kii dukaan nahin khulti he
 For this, the Rajasthan government sets a distribution week every month
 july main 10 july se lekar 24 july ke bich vitaran saptaah rakhaa gaya
 So when the ration shop opens, the crowd is quite large
 ab agar kisi kaa angootha nahin mila, kisi kii ungali ke nishaan nahin mili to use anaaj nahin milegaa
 Due to repeated attempts to match the mark, there is also a delay, so the crowd outside the ration shop will lose patience
 chunki garib or aam logon ke liye bheed or samay kii koi keemat nahin hoti isliye ham middle class logon ko yah baat samaj main bhi nahin aegi
 He will definitely see his trouble when he is asked to spend an hour in line at the Passport Office
 tab ve twit kar bharat ko kosenge or kahenge ki kya aise super power banegaa apana india
 Our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh and her team members from Rajasthan went to the government ration shops and recorded the experience of common people
 chaar jilon se unhone yah anubhav jamaa kiye hai taaki aapako hamako pataa chale ki sarkaar kitni bhi behatar yojana bana le, jo aam or garib he uski dikkaton kaa nipataara nahin hota he
 It may be that the machine is saving its coffers, but if no one gets that month's grain, what will he save
 uskaa kya bachataa he
 Will be hungry
 bhamashah atm mashin kisi ko nahin jaanati he
 She only recognizes you with your thumb impression
 rashan kaa dukandaar ab aapako bhi nahin pahachaanegaa kyonki mashin ne aapke nishaan ko nahin pahachaanaa
 Right now, perhaps the government has given some concession in such a situation, but the problem that is happening tells what will happen if the Aadhaar card is made mandatory
 dilli ke akhabaaron main ham isaki keval khubiyaan hi padhate hai lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki jo log mehnat mazdooree karte hai unke haathon ke nishaan mit jate hai
 Have you ever seen one of the workers coming to your home with the palm raised? See
 mashin kya hamaare jyotish log bhi fail ho jaaenge
 Astrologers will start dodging the forehead, but the machine is not allowed to see the frontal and give ration
 main kuch ungaliyon, anguuthon ke nishaan aapako dikhaa saktaa hum jo harsha kumari singh ne bheje hai
 The marks on the hands of the working people are worn out
 gaanv dehaat main auraton kii ungaliyon main kuch bachataa nahin he
 Their destiny lines also disappear when the utensils are created
 aadhaar card jab aayega to aise tamaam log kai yojanaon se baahar ho sakate hai
 The government will make arrangements that if the mark is not found, then DM, get it written by SDM but think if there are so many capable people who will easily get the certificate
 mukhiya ke paas bhi jaaenge to vah kitna khel khelegaa
 Instead, how much control will he have over the lives of these people
 harsha kaa kahana he ki kitne logon kii ungaliyon ke nishaan mit gaye hai, iskaa koi survey nahin he
 i have no problem with the machine
 kya pataa ham aane vaale daur main mashin ke aadhaar par jeene lagen
 My complaint is more about the human problem than the machine
 jab koi aisi mashin nahin bani jo maanav kii har samasya kaa ilaaj kar de to rashan kii har samasya kaa ilaaj koi mashin kaise ho sakati he
 Are we ready for this machine to date or are we restless to earn a name in the world by implementing it that we have done something amazing? or jo aam logon kii takalif or dard he, uskaa kya? This machine runs with a SIM card
 dilli jaise shahar main do saal se kol drops kii mahamari faili hui he
 Comes in newspapers every day
 haalat yah ki ab to paardarshita ke naam par telephone company vigyaapan hi dene lagi he ki uske ap se pataa chal jayega ki kahaan network he, kahaan nahin he
 But where will the poor people know
 jab dilli main network kaa pukhta intjaam nahin he to gaanv dehaat kii kya haalat hogi? jaise ek sajjan ko mashin kaa network nahin mila
 They were looking for a network with machines in hand, just as people before the 90s used to climb up on rooftops to find the network of Doordarshan by turning the antennas sometimes towards Nepal or sometimes towards Bhutan
 barmer kii rashan ke ek dukandaar ji apni mashin lekar network dhund rahe the
 Searching, shopkeepers came to Jeebahar
 baahar aate-aate sadak par aa gaye
 Now they kept searching the network in the air, the people standing outside the shop remained there
 dukandaar ji mashin kaa network khojate rahe or chunki garib logon ke vakt kii koi keemat nahin hoti to ve intjaar karte rahe
 The biggest thing is not even tweeted
 soshal media par desh kii demokrasi shift ho gai he or yah log hai ki abhi tak rashan kii dukaan main demokrasi ke anaaj kaa intjaar karte rahe
 How sad kareeb saat karod aabaadi he rajasthan kii
 Out of this, 4 crore 34 lakh people depend on the government's cheap grain schemes, which take rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene from ration shops
 yah log bazaar dar se gehun nahin kharid sakate hai
 Pulses are not available, so Ram knows how these poor people would eat one hundred and fifty rupees of pulses
 kya sirf roti khate honge, yaa chaaval or maad hi khaakar rah jate honge
 We really do not know because their fault is that there is no social media where democracy lives these days
 baharhaal sarkaar kaa kaam yah bhi he ki anaaj use hi mili jise milanaa chahie
 So she keeps cleaning lists from time to time
 kyonki garibon ko anaaj dene ke kaarykram par karodon rupye kharch hote hai
 Harsha Kumari Singh said that the lists are still being sorted, but 15 lakh new people have also been added, who should have got but were not getting it
 khaadya suraksha act ke tahat jin logon ko milanaa chahie, sabhi ko to nahin mil rahaa he, magar daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki mil rahaa he
 Any plan poses a challenge
 ho saktaa he ki yah shuruaati chunauti ho, lekin jo garib 2 rupye se zyada kaa anaaj kharid nahin saktaa use anaaj milane main ek din kii deree ho jaae to uskaa kya? ummid he yah report sarkaar ko apana system thik karne main kaam aa sakegi
 a surprising case has emerged from Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan keval 60 kilo chane ke liye ek yuvak ko aropiyon ne zanjeeron main baandh diya
 The whole case is such that 50-year-old Madanlal Gond gave 60 kg of gram to Hariprasad living in the village at the time of sowing 2 years ago
 in do saalon main hariprasad ne naa to chane lautaae naa hi uski keemat adaa kii
 On Monday, Madan's son Satish brought Hariprasad to his house
 paise nahin lautaane par naaraaz baap bete ne apane ghar ke baahar hi ek ped se hari ke haath-pair zanjeer or rassi se baandh die
 The villagers saw Hari's condition and tried to convince Madan, but Madan and Satish did not leave Hari

 After reaching Chandwana, the police rescued Hari and brought everyone to Khategaon Police Station
 maamle main police ne cese darj kar madan or satish ko giraftaar kar liya
 However, this news is important because the government is running many schemes for the poor tribals, including giving seeds for sowing on behalf of the Department of Agriculture
 aise main keval 60 kilo chane kaa karja waapas karne ke liye ek yuvak ko 45 degree kii garmi main bhookha pyaasa jaanwaron kii tarah baandh diya gaya
 This whole incident raises many questions on government schemes
 chhattisgarh ke bilaspur main ek saat saal kii bacchee se darindagi kiye jane kaa maamla saamne he
 It is being told that the roommates living with the girl in her hostel not only thrashed, but also put a stick in her private part
 news agency eenai ke mutabik, yah ghatana 23 farvari ko hui thi, lekin maamla tab saamne aayaa jab bacchee or uski maa ne buudhvaar (28, farvari) ko gaurela thane main shikaayat darj karai
 In the complaint, the girl told the police that, "on the night of 23 February, a girl living in the hostel had put clothes in the bathrooms
 un kapadon par mere dhakke se ek anya ladki ke kapade gir gaye
 Angered by this, both girls started quarreling with me
 unhone mujhe pehle peeta phir privet part main chadi daal di
 "the girl's mother told that the girl had kept this thing under pressure due to fear
 holi ke liye main use lene ke liye pahunchi to vah mujhase lipatakar rone lagi
 i noticed that there were bruises on his body
 usase jab usase poocha gaya to bacchee ne puri ghatana bataai
 According to the sources, during the medical test, the baby's body has got bruises and infection in the private part
 doctor ne bhi bacchee ke saath hui darindagi kii pushti kii he
 The girl is currently being treated in a hospital
 udhar, police ne bacchee kii maa kii shikaayat par ipisi kii dhara 377 or 323 or pakso act ke tahat cese darj kiya he
 Additional SP Madhulika Singh said that such an incident in government hostels is very worrying
 bacchee ke saath jis tarah kii darindagi hui usase yah lagata he ki hostel prashasan se andekhi hui he
 At present, we have registered a case and are being investigated
 emsidi ke upachunaav ke thik ek din baad kejariwal ne apana purna rajya kaa mudda phir se ched diya
 If the bill is brought, there is bound to be a dispute
 sambhavat mukhyamantri ko pataa he ki is bill kaa kya bhavishya hone vaala he, lihaaja jab press conferes kii shuruyaat hui to bill se zyada itihaas kii charchaa hui, bijepi-congress ko yaad dilaane kii koshish hui to sangharsh in donon partiyon ne kaaphi kiya, ab sirf unke sangharsh ko aage badhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 The rhetorical extreme question about the occupation of Delhi is that what is actually there in the bill and what is new if it is there? For the last one and a half years, everyone has seen the story of getting involved with the LG government, sometimes the Delhi Police, sometimes the MCD or sometimes the central government, and people have known the political rhetoric, the pain is huge
 aam aadmi party 2014 ke chunaavon ke dauraan jo vaayade kiye, unamem bijli-pani kaa mudda to shaamil tha hi, saath hi dilli ke mekaover ko lekar kai baaten kahin gai thim
 500 new schools, 20 new colleges, 10 thousand buses, from tough measures for women safety to a lot of talk on civic facilities, but the crisis is of the land, which is with the DDA, the crisis is from the police, which is the Ministry of Home Affairs The question of the underdog and the MCD, an attempt to capture it was also made by the Sheela government, even then there was no success and the matter came to a stand on the division of MCD into three
 selary ko lekar emsidi se pichley ek saal main jo do bade takaraav ke baad dilli kii kya sthiti hui, ise sabane dekha or bhugta
 If we go to the provisions of this bill of the government, then Kejriwal government believes that apart from Lutyens Delhi i
e
 New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantt, the rest of Delhi should have the authority of Delhi Government
 chunki lutian jone main ambesi, parliament, saansadon ke nivas, raashtrapati-pradhanmantri nivas or viipi quarter hai or dilli kaint main bada army aria he, lihaaja kejariwal kaa maananaa he ki vahaan suraksha or prashasnic vyavastha kii jimmedaari centre apane paas rakh sakati he
 Apart from this, the authority or interference over Delhi, police, land and administration should remain with the Delhi government
 kya he draft bill main+ prastaavit bill main dilli municipal corporation act 1957 main badlaav kii baat kahi gai he
 + Under clause (10) of section 2, Delhi means the entire Delhi, New Delhi and Delhi Cantonment
 + 'rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli' kii jagah 'dilli rajya' kaa naam diya gaya he
 + Government will mean Delhi Government
 + dilli deveopment act 1957 main bhi sanshodhan kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 + Also, an amendment to the Delhi Police Act 1978 is proposed
 + sabase dilli mahatvapurn sanshodhan 'administrator yani leftinent garvanar' ke sandarbh main he, jinke naam main sanshodhan kar use sirf 'rajyapal' rakhaa gaya he
 + Explaining this, it is stated that the Governor will work under the advice and cooperation of the Cabinet under Article 163 of the Constitution
 + ab tak jo 239 (a) ke tahat prashasnic adhikaar dilli ke alji ko hasil he, usamen katautee kiye jane kaa prastaav he
 + The proposal calls for a separate administrative cadre for the state of Delhi
 + hai court of neshnal capital territary kaa naam badalakar hai court of dilli rakhane kaa prastaav bhi shaamil he
 After all, why should DDA, Police and mcdkejriwal government need land to complete their many projects
 lekin jameen didie ke paas he or didie se jameen lene ke liye use paisa dena padataa he
 Kejriwal has often expressed the pain of how the DDA demands crores of rupees from the Delhi government to acquire land for a bus depot
 emsidi se bhi jab selary or paise ko lekar takaraav hua or emsidi ne jab bhi chauthe vitt ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kii maang kii, sarkaar ne didie kii maang kii
 However, it is also true that the DDA does not have enough land left
 kamovesh yahi sthiti dilli police ko lekar bhi he
 Kejriwal, who sought resignation from Sheila Dixit after the Nirbhaya incident and questioned her helplessness, could not do much about women's safety in the last year and a half
 kejariwal par vaadakhilaphi kaa aropakejariwal main mahila suraksha ke liye ap kii baat kii thi, 15 lakh sisitivi lagane the, mahila commando wing banaaya janaa tha, bason main suraksha ke liye marshall lagaae jane the, par kuch khaas nahin hua or vipaksh lagaataar sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 The Delhi government created a ruckus about the Meenakshi murder case but was surrounded by questions as to what the sheela type was about to express her unforgiveness
 chunki emsiji ke jimme buniyadi civik kaary ke alaava shiksha or senitessan kaa kaam he or vahaan fund kaa ronaa laga rahata he, lihaaja sarkaar main aane ke baad se kejariwal teenon nagar nigamon ko apane under chaahate hai
 During the garbage movement, the government talked about auditing the funds of the three municipal corporations, but nothing special happened
 ab sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki keval centre sarkaar or diplomet kii maujuudagi kii vajah se baaki do karod logon ke vikaas or suraksha kaa daanv par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 The bjp-congress raised questions in which Kejriwal was discussing the efforts of the BJP and the Congress in the press conference
 It was not long before these parties started questioning Kejriwal's intentions
 sabase pehle bijepi se saaf kiya kii party apane purna rajya kii maang par apana ruukh 2014 main saaf kar diya he or ab party purna rajya ke paksh main nahin he
 The party's argument is that the manner in which Kejriwal and his leaders are using derogatory language about the bureaucracy and Delhi Police and the manner in which they want to handle the authorities, questions are being raised on Kejriwal's administrative capacity
 
 aise main purna adhikaar kejariwal sarkaar ko dene kaa koi matlab nahin he
 bjp's party president Satish Upadhyay argues whether the Kejriwal government is talking about a police split, one for New Delhi that reports to the Center and the other for Delhi, which reports to Kejriwal
 saath hi, nai dilli or dilli kaint se chune gaye vidhayakon kaa kya hoga, wo apni musiibat kisase kahenge or shikaayat bani rahegi
 For example, Kejriwal himself is an MLA from New Delhi, and report to the police center there, this would be the Chief Minister's confession
 kya is upaay se takaraav ghatega yaa ulajhane badhengi
 At the same time, former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit believes that after the by-election of SCD, there is a doubt about bringing such a proposal
 logon ko lag rahaa he ki kaam dilli main kuch hua nahin he or log congress or kejariwal sarkaar main tulana kar rahe or parinaam usee disha main he
 The department or matters that come under the Kejriwal government, a lot has been done in the same scope even before, now it can be done, but instead of work everything is happening
 ab aage kya?sarkaar logon se raay ke baad vidhansabha main purna rajya kii maang ko lekar prastaav paas kar sakati he or ise centre ke paas bhejegi, taaki samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye ise lagu karaayaa ja sake
 But in reality whether this is possible or not
 darasal, 1993 main sabase pehle bijepi sarkaar ne purna rajya kaa prastaav dilli vidhansabha main paarit kiya tha, tab mukhyamantri madanlaal khurana the
 On September 11, 2002, once again the full state resolution was passed unanimously during the reign of Sheila Dikshit, when the NDA government was also at the center
 tab centre main laalkrishna adwani ne rajyasabha main sanshodhan bill pesh kiya, jise parliament cameti ke paas bheja gaya, par aage kuch baat nahin bani
 The Congress had also raised the demand for full statehood
 On 26 November 2010, the Delhi Assembly once again passed a resolution demanding full statehood, when the Congress was at the center
 lihaaja prastaav paarit ho or use lagu kara diya jaae, ye maujuuda vyavastha main sambhav nahin he, yah tay he
 The same Delhi government introduced the Lokpal bill, passed it, sent it to the center, now the Delhi government is not ready to take care of what happened to that bill
 pichley chah maheene se lagbhag ek darjan bill aise he jis dilli vidhansabha ne paas to kiya, par ab tak maamle latake hue hai
 Even the salary of mlas is pending with the Center
 vaayu sena pramukh pi ve nike ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki pakistan ko america sainya madad bharat ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he tathaa isse obama prashasan ko avgat kara diya gaya he
 Naik, after assuming the responsibility of the chairman of the Chief of Staff Committee, said, "the help given to Pakistan is definitely a cause of concern for us and we have conveyed this
 hamane kuch bhi nahin chipaaya he

 bhartiya cricket team ke captain shaayad hi kabhi apane haath main aae balle ko niraash karte honge, isiilie to unhen ran mashin kaha jaataa he
 And when it comes to chasing a target set by a team, there is no one better than Kohli

 Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan ranks third in such records
 dilashaan ne 116 pariyon main 11 shatak banaae
 Apart from this, Kohli became the first Indian captain to score two centuries against the West Indies in the Caribbean
 pehle, rahul dravid ne westeindies ke khilaaf captain ke rup main ek shatak jadaa tha

 basapa supremeo mayawati ne ravivaar ko upi chunaav kaa shankhanaad agra se kiya
 Agra is a safe seat in big cities, that's why Maya held the initial rally from Agra
 postaron bannron se agra ko paat diya gaya, takat dikhaane ke liye maaya ne agra ke kothi minaa bazaar kaa maidan chunaa
 It is said that this ground is so big that no party dares to rally here soon
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main modi kii yahaan raily hui thi
 The crowd gathered, after all, the BSP candidates of 16 assembly seats in Agra and Aligarh division had to face the test in front of their behenji
 1 baje ain maaya, bhaashan main saaf kar di apni chunavi ranneetikreeb ek baje mayawati kaa helicopter maidan par utraa, helicopter se utar kar wo car se manch tak pahuchin
 Then began the speech round
 mayawati ke ek ghante 20 minute ke bhaashan main sabase zyada bijepi or aresas nishane par rahe
 Accusing the Modi government of working for the rights of Dhanna Seths, they accused him of making false promises and making false promises
 to vahin sangh pramukh par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki ye log hinduon ko zyada bachche paidaa karne ko kah rahe hai, jabaki abhi bhi log bhukhe so rahe hai
 The Sangh would first tell the Modi government why they do nothing to end poverty, unemployment and hunger
 mayane daliton ko oona samet desh bhar main daliton ke khilaaf huin ghatnaon ke liye bijepi ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 The Buddhist monks who supported the BJP were also sharply attacked by Maya and said that some selfish and RSS people are trying to manipulate the hair
 saaf tha ki mayawati ko 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav yaad he, jab upi main unki koi seat nahin ai
 There is also a fear of the Hindu card of BJP that Dalits do not break with the BSP in bjp's Hindu card
 sapa ke vikaas par kii chot, congress kii haalat bataai khastasapa sarkaar kii kanoon vyavastha par to mayawati ne hameshaa kii tarah chot kii, lekin akhilesh sarkaar ke vikaas ke daavon kii ye kahkar hawa nikaalane kii koshish ki saare bade project kii shuruyaat basapa sarkaar ke vakt hi hui thi
 At the same time, while taunting the Dalit feast of Congress and BJP leaders, Mayawati did not consider the Congress to be in the fight, as it was a disaster
 kaha- tilak, taraazoo or talwaar vaala naaraa basapa kaa nahinmayawati ne dalit votbain k ke baad savarnon ko bhi sansh diya
 Maya said that Savarna should not get confused
 basapa kabhi tilak, taraazoo or talwaar jaise naare kaa samarthan nahin karti
 They also get big positions in the BSP, they also become ministers in the government
 phir naaraa diya-sarvajan hitay, sarvajan sukhaay
 Attempting to woo the Muslims too, Mayawati wants the BJP to win power in UP by fighting the people of one religion against the people of another religion, when the law will rule not Jungle Raj
 kisi dharm vishesh ke khilaaf kaam karne waalon ko bakhsha nahin jaayegaa
 On coming to power, strict action will be taken against such people
 media par bhi baraseen mayawathibaspa supremeo ko ehsaas tha ki haal main swami prasad maury samet kai netaaon ke chhodkar jane kaa nakaaratmak sandesh janata ke bich gaya he
 Therefore, the leaders who accused the accused after leaving first, then attacked the party they went to, and then targeted a section of the media, saying that there is a section of Manuwadi and Dhannaseths in the media who are against the BSP
 Pulls for a long time, while the general media only sees such a news in a day or two
 dalit-muslim gathjod ke saath savarna voton par maaya kii najaramaya ke bhaashan ne saaf ho gaya ki, siyaasi sameekaran ke lihaaj se pehle wo dalit muslim gathjod bananaa chaahati hai or phir ummid rakhti hai ki majboot base banane par savarnon kaa ek tabaka bhi unke saath aa jayega or wo upi ke siem kii kursi par phir se kabiz ho jaaengi
 But Maya will have to take care that if the Dalits do not move on the lines of the Lok Sabha, then they will have to find the answer to the question of the Muslim community at large that after three times she has formed a government with the BJP first, what will not be guaranteed
 is
 par is baat jawaab to mayawati ne agra kii raily main diya nahin
 Finally happy to see the crowd, Mayawati made two rounds of the field with her helicopter before leaving

 do nirdaleey vidhayakon ke karnataka kii congress-jedies gathbandhan sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi baad shuru hue siyaasi naatak par pardaa gir gaya he
 Former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa juggled two independent mlas, but could not convince the Congress mlas to resign
 unke tamaam prayaas ke baavjood oparation lotus 3 fail ho gaya
 This political drama of Karnataka is being called Operation Lotus 3 because Yeddyurappa has tried to form the government twice before
 congress vidhayakon kaa istipha dilaane main naakaam rahe yeddicongress dwaara shuukravaar ko bulaai gai vidhayak dal kii baithak ke liye vidhayak dal ke netaa siddharmaiya kii taraf se sabhi vidhayakon ke liye vip jari kiya gaya he, jisamen shaamil na hone vaale vidhayak ayogy ghoshit kiye ja sakate hai
 After the release of the whip, two choices left before the angry Congress mlas either stand with the party or resign after being disqualified and come back to the assembly contested on the symbol of 'kamal'
 lekin in congress vidhayakon kii sankhya itani nahin thi ki yediurppa kii sarkaar ban jaati
 Therefore, it was considered appropriate for these mlas to return to the Congress camp
 do nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan vaapasi ke baavjood karnataka kii echdi kumaraswami sarkaar ke paas aankade puure the
 The coalition had 118 legislators in the 224-member assembly and there was no real threat to the government
 lekin maahaul aisa bana maano sarkaar girane vaali he
 Meanwhile, the stir escalated when former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa along with 104 BJP mlas reached the resort of Gurugram and 4 Congress mlas suddenly got out of touch with the party
 alaakaman ne sadhi chuppibies yediurppa ne is dauraan bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se milane kaa samay bhi maanga
 But the party adopted the strategy of wait and see because just before this, the BJP had tried unsuccessfully to form a government in Karnataka in which it was very bad
 jaahir he party kaa kendriya netritv loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apni chhavi ko lekar koi risk nahin lenaa chahta hoga
 Yeddyurappa's attempt to keep himself relevant was, according to analysts, that this attempt to form a government was a one-sided attempt by 75-year-old former Chief Minister BS Yeddyrappa
 kyonki unhen pataa he ki yadi ab mukhyamantri nahin bane to saal 2023 main unki umr 80 saal kii hogi or tab ve bijepi kii parampara ke mutabik is pad ke liye ayogy ho jaaenge
 For some time, Yeddyurappa's record has been less of victory and more of defeat, in which despite being the largest party, it could not form the government, losing four seats out of five seats in the by-elections held last October and 2 failed attempts to form the government
 Are prominent
 pichley 6 maheenon main yediurppa kii taraf se sarkaar banane kii ye teesri naakaam koshish thi
 According to political analysts, the fear behind Yeddyurappa's attempt was that if he does not become the Chief Minister this time, he will not be able to be again
 kyonki congress-jedies ke paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karne tak bijepi rajya main duusari pankti kaa netritv khadaa karnaa chaahati he
 So, if they succeed, they will be able to keep themselves politically relevant for the next few years
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko yediurppa kii jaruratyediurppa kii is naakamayaabi ke baad unke liye aage ke raste band ho gaye hai aisa bhi nahin he, kam se kam loksabhaa chunaav tak to aisa nahin hone vaala
 For the last several years, there has been talk of creating new leadership in the bjp's Karnataka unit
 lekin ab tak yediurppa jaisaa maas leader koi doosraa khadaa nahin ho paaya
 So even though they failed in their attempt to form a government, they are the only face of the party in the state
 karnataka main loksabhaa kii 28 siten hai
 BJP President Amit Shah has a target of winning at 20
 congress or jedies gathbandhan kaa ek saath chunaav ladanaa tay mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Yeddyurappa, the most effective leader of Lingayat community, will need the party in the Lok Sabha elections
 aakarshak vyaktitv, damdaar aawaaj or shandaar abhinay
 
 
 These are the things that make Amitabh the great hero of the century

 Seeing the publicity of this scene before the film release, it seems that Prakash Jha is going to give him a place in the film, because once Amitabh made a film super hit by flying, why not add the luck of the film to the fly again 
 'aarakshan' film main big bi ek college ke principal bane hai or saf unke student hai
 As the name suggests, this film is based on the Supreme Court's decision on the demand for reservation

 narendra modi kaa dabadabaa congress-upie or endie se bhi zyada bijepi main dar kaa sabab bana hua he
 Modi's name is not acceptable to a section of the party
 dal or sangh ke dabaav main philhal chuppi chai hui he, lekin visphot kabhi bhi ho saktaa he
 a nectar for the party in the form of Narendra Modi emerged from the bjp's Goa churn, which filled the millions of workers with amazing enthusiasm
 khud party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne party kaaryakartaaon kii bhari mehfil main modi ko sabase bada netaa maan liya
 But the nectar to which millions of workers, including the party president, became desperate, the same nectar became poison for many big leaders
 modi ko 'bhasmasur' to congress ke ek bade netaa ne kaha, lekin iskaa ehsaas to bijepi main hi kai netaaon ko hota rahaa he
 Modi, who was exiled from Gujarat, got the reins of Gujarat, thanks to Advani
 jis modi ko gujarat dangon ke saae main hataane ke mood main aa gaye the tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi, usee modi ko kaiyon ke virodh ke baavjood bachaaya adwani ne
 Then Advani had told Vajpayee - If Modi is removed, a ruckus will arise
 ab modi 2014 ke liye party ke sabase bade maharathi ban gaye, to adwani bavaal machaane lage or modi ke naam par modi samarthak bhi
 Advani is considered to be the biggest leader of the BJP
 isliye istife kaa pansaa phenkakar apana virodh bhi jataa diya, nahin to bijepi main aise netaaon kii kami nahin, jo modi ke badhate kad or pad se dare hue hai
 Whether it is Sushma Swaraj who advocates Advani's kingship, or Jaswant Singh or Yashwant Sinha, all these leaders are finding it very difficult to accept Modi
 modi ne naam par bijepi ne 2014 jeetne ke liye apana ashwamedh yajna shuru kar diya he
 bjp's horse has left lekin us ghode kii lagaam modi ke haath main hona bijepi ne kai netaaon main naa sirf khaali haath hone kaa dar paidaa kar rahaa he, balki party main bhi badi bhitarghaat kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi and the head of the Aam Aadmi Party, has started showing his attitude again after almost a year of silence
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi ko lekar kejariwal ne phir aakraamak rukh dikhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 After losing the municipal corporations of Punjab and Delhi in 2017, the Aam Aadmi Party changed the strategy by brainstorming
 april 2017 se lekar may 2018 arvind kejariwal ne pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf sidhe taur par prahaar karne se parhez kiya
 For the past one week, Arvind Kejriwal is seen returning once again in the same familiar style
 kejariwal dilli main apni sarkaar ko modi sarkaar kii ore se pareshaan karne or kaam naa karne dene jaise aarope laga rahe hai
 At the same time, they are also citing the problems faced by the people of the country by the economic policies of the Center
 kya he kejariwal ke puraane tevar main lautne kii vajah?kejariwal ke achaanak puraane tevar main lautne kii vajah kya he? kya deshbhar main vipakshi ekajutata or mahagathbandhan banane kii sambhavana ne kejariwal ko aisa karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 In many states, the practice of joining hands of local satraps has started against BJP
 haalankiam aadmi party ye saaf nahin kiya he ki wo mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa hogi yaa nahin
 But whether it is Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal or Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra, Leftist leader Sitaram Yechury or actor Kamal Haasan in Tamil Nadu, Kejriwal seems to be sharing the stage with everyone these days

 Obviously, in such a situation, his alliance with the Congress is formed in Delhi, then Kejriwal's effort will be that the Aam Aadmi Party's hand should be above the Congress

 Soon after the news of Delhi PWD and Health Minister Satyendar Jain's house being raided on May 30, Kejriwal reacted and wrote directly on social media, "what does Prime Minister Modi want?" On May 29, Kejriwal wrote on social media referring to a policy being implemented in the health sector by the Delhi government, 'my concern is only whether Prime Minister Modi and BJP will allow this policy to be implemented
 main unase darkhwaast karata hum ki ve uparajyapal ke jariye is main adnga nahin lagaayenge

 The Aam Aadmi Party feels that due to failures on many fronts in the country, the graph of the Modi government is falling down and this is the right time to intensify its attack, that is why Kejriwal has asked Prime Minister Modi as per his old identity Have decided to do two hands on each front

 The most wanted terrorist of India, Masood Azhar survived once again
 batch gaya kyonki uske saamne china kii diwaar khadi thi
 This is the fourth time in the last 10 years that China has saved Jaish kingpin Masood Azhar from becoming an international terrorist
 sawaal ye he ki aakhir china ek aatanki ko baar baar kyon bachaa rahaa he
 What is his attachment to Masood Azhar? So the answer is money and power
 china ne pakistan main kharbon rupee kaa nivesh kar rakhaa he
 Therefore, Pakistan cannot be angry and peace in India is not in China's interest
 lihaaza wo pakistan ke zarie bharat ko bas uljhaae rakhana chahta he
 There is a great old saying in India
 ek haath de
 Take a hand
 magar ye kahawat china ke raste pakistan pahunchate pahunchate badalane lagati he

 or masood ajahar ko bachaane ke liye vito lagaaya
 For the last 18 years
 
 That is, from the 2001 Parliament attacks to the 2019 Pulwama attack
 pakistan kaa ye khoonkhaar aatanki ek ke baad ek bharat ko kai zakhm de chukaa he
 All the countries of the world believed that this kingpin of Jaish is a threat to the whole of humanity
 lihaaza ise global terrarist ghoshit kiya janaa chahie taaki aatank par nakel kasi ja sake
 But for the last 10 years, China has been shielded by this kingpin of terror
 or jab-jab bharat ne ise global tebrist list main daalane kii koshish
 Then and again China obstructed the UN Security Council
 haalanki pulavama hamale ke baad is baar 27 farvari ko ye prastaav france, britain or america laayaa tha
 More than 10 countries supported the proposal
 tay kiya gaya ki agar suraksha parishad ke kisi sadsy ko is par aitaraaz naa hua to
 Jaish leader Masood Azhar will be declared an international terrorist
 is lihaaz se prastaav kii samay seemaa buudhvaar yani 13 march raat 12:30 baje khatm ho rahi thi
 It felt like Masood would get punished for what he had done
 magar prastaav kii samay seemaa khatm hone se thik ek ghante pehle
 China put a block on it
 china ne kaha ki wo pehle bhi kah chukaa he ki bina sabooton ke karrwai galat he
 On which America requested China to act wisely
 kyonki bharat-paak main shanti ke liye masood ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karnaa jaruri he
 Another attempt to declare Masood Azhar as an international terrorist was thwarted after China's obstruction
 haalanki is prastaav par adnge ke baad suraksha parishad ke sadasyon ne china ko saaf chetavanee di he ki agar wo masood azhar ko lekar apane rukh ko nahin badalegaa to karrwai ke duusare vikalp bhi khule hai
 In total, China has done the trick four times in the last 10 years to save Masood Azhar
 2009 main bharat khud ye prastaav lekar aayaa tha
 At the same time, in 2016, India proposed the P-3 i
e
 America, France and Britain together
 2017 main pi-3 deshon ne hi ye prastaav pesh kiya tha
 And this time also after the Pulwama terror attack, this proposal was brought with France, Britain and America
 haalanki is baar china ne is prastaav ko giraane ke liye vito power kaa istemaal nahin kiya he, balki sutron ke mutabik china ne prastaav ko ‘technical hold’ par rakhaa he
 a technical hold means he needs some more time to consider the proposal
 is lihaaz se aisa nahin he ki masood azhar ke sir par lataki antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit hone kii talwaar hat gai he
 But looking at the history of China, it seems that he can support Pakistan to weaken India
 sawaal ye he ki aakhir china ek aatanki ko baar baar kyon bachaa rahaa he
 
 masood azhar se aakhir uskaa aisa kya lagaav he? to iskaa jawaab he paisa or power
 China has invested trillions of rupees in Pakistan
 isaliye pakistan ko naaraaz nahin kar saktaa or bharat main shanti ho ye china ke hit main nahin he
 So he wants to keep India just entangled through Pakistan

 The video of the alleged beating of a minor girl for molesting a minor girl in Shahpur near Mumbai has gone viral
 pitayee kaa aarope ladki ke bhaaiyon par he
 At present, the police have registered a case against the victim of the beating, but are asking to check the video on the question of action against the beaten
 maamla mumbai se sate shahpur taluka ke khardi ilaake kaa he
 The girl's brothers are accused of beating her
 marpet kaa video soshal media par viral hone ke baad washind police ne pitane vaale ke khilaaf to maamla darj kar liye, lekin peetane waalon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii he
 The comments video main do ladke ek flats main ek ladke ko berahami se maarthe dikh rahe hai, vahiin kuch video banane main mashgool hai
 Inspector Anil Pawar of Washind police station says, 'video has also come to us, the matter is being investigated
 yadi akshay ko peetane waalon ke khilaaf bhi shikaayat aati he to uske saath marpet karne waalon par bhi karrwai hogi
 'police is currently searching for the man who is beating, he says that after taking the statement, if the facts are revealed in the investigation then action will be taken against others

 bihar kii special branch kaa ek aadesh in dinon surkhiyon main he
 In fact, the Intelligence Wing of the Special Branch has ordered the gathering of information about the state functionaries of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its subsidiary organizations
 yah aadesh may main special branch ke sabhi dipti espi ko jari kiya gaya he, jisamen unase sanghathanon ke padaadhikariyon kaa naam or pate kii jaankaree ikattha karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 In the order issued by the Special Branch, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Hindu Jagran Samiti, Dharm Jagran Samnayava Samiti, Muslim Rashtriya Manch, Hindu Rashtra Sena, Rashtriya Sevika Samiti, Shiksha Bharati, Durga Vahini, Svedashi Jagran Manch , Bharatiya Kisan Union, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Indian Railway Association, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, Akhil Bharatiya Teachers Federation, Hindu Mahasabha, Hindu Yu Receiving corps, officials named the Hindu son organization and address is required
 special branch kaa adeshspecial branch kaa ye aadesh isi saal 28 may ko jari kiya gaya tha
 After the copy of this order came out, the top officers of Bihar Police are refraining from speaking anything
 naam na chhapane kii shart par ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki ye rutin abhyaas he
 The Crime Branch team keeps on collecting such information at regular intervals
 bihar sarkaar ke is aadesh par purv kendriya mantri or bijepi netaa sanjay paswan ne kaha ki bihar kii police sarkaar ke dwaara sangh ke logon ke bare main jaankaree jutaney ke aadesh dena kaaphi gambhir mudda he
 Both BJP and Sangh are taking it seriously
 bharat main savarnon ne jo dhardaar andolan chalaae hai, unamem aarakshan ke khilaaf kiya gaya andolan aaj bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 It is also said that this movement also made him realize his power
 veepi singh ne jab mandal kamishan kii siforishein lagu kii thim tab iske khilaaf kai yuvaaon ne jaan tak de di thi
 The agitators used to argue that jobs should be got on the basis of merit
 aarakshan ke tahat chunaa gaya doctor yaa ejeeniyar ek merit vaale ke saamne kahaan tikega? kisi bhi tarah kaa aarakshan merit waalon ke saath anyaay he
 The second argument was that the basis of reservation should be economic
 iske baad garib savarnon ke liye bhi aarakshan kii maang kii jane lagi
 Constitution amendment related to reservation bill for general category has passed in Lok Sabha
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya savarnon kaa aarakshan ko lekar virodh shant ho jayega? kya ab yah sawaal nahin uthenge ki kisi bhi tarah kaa aarakshan merit ke saath samjhauta he
 Will not the people who take the benefit of this 10 percent reservation be less qualified than those who get success without reservation? Will those who call Kota begging still stand by their words? Wouldn't it be a matter to abolish every kind of reservation? Does the Modi government really want to give reservation benefits to the general class people or is it a tingle
 kahaan se diya jayega savarna aarakshanbil ke mutabik saamaanya varg ko 10 fisadi aarakshan anusuchit jati, janajati or anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) ke liye milane vaale rigerveshan main se nahin hoga
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear in the Lok Sabha that 10 percent reservation to the general class will not violate the 50 percent limit prescribed by the Supreme Court
 jetali ne bataaya ki supreme court ne 50 fisadi kii jo seemaa nirdhaarit kii he vah keval saamaajik or aarthik rup se pichhadon ke liye he
 The reasoning behind this was that at least 50 per cent of the seats for the general class should be left or else there would have been discrimination against the other class to revive one class
 is lihaaj se maujuuda bill supreme court ke nirnay ke peeche kii bhaavana ke khilaaf nahin he
 This means that the reservation given will be given out of the same 50 per cent in which members of the general class have been fighting or which is open to all
 aarakshan ke khilaaf bolne vaale kahaan hai?to kya modi sarkaar ne apane is master stroke se aarakshan ke khilaaf bolne waalon ko niruttar kar diya he? savarnon kaa ek bada tabaka rigerveshan ke khilaaf bolta rahaa he
 When former Prime Minister VP Singh implemented the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, a round of demonstrations started across the country
 khudakushi kii ghatnaayen saamne ain
 Later, an organization like Youth for Equality emerged
 yah sanghathan hameshaa jati aadhaarit rigerveshan kaa virodh karata rahaa he, chaahe vah mandal kamishan ho yaa padonnati main aarakshan kaa masalaa ho
 Support but join 50 percent this reservation now Youth for Equality is supporting this 10 percent reservation bill of Modi government
 youth for ikvality ke secretary dow
 Arun Kumar, in a program of 'aaj Tak', described it as a historic and bold step
 unhone kaha ki ab tak aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii baat nahin hoti thi
 Social and economic backward classes are also written in the constitution
 kahin jati kaa zikr nahin he
 But so far reservation continues at the ethnic level
 aarakshan kii 10 saal par samiksha kii baat kahi gai thi, lekin yah nahin hua
 If after 70 years, advocating reservation on economic grounds is being done, then it is a commendable step
 haalanki vah kehete hai ki yadi aarakshan anarakshit hisse se jaataa he to youth for ikvality iskaa virodh karegaa
 President of Youth for Equality Dr
 kaushalkant mishra ne bhi aajtak
 told that if the matter goes to the Supreme Court, then the court will send it for scrutiny
 us dauraan unka sanghathan is savarna aarakshan ko anya pichhadaa varg ke liye nirdhaarit aarakshan main samahit karne kii maang karegaa or iske liye yachika daayar karegaa
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is also considered anti-reservation
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne aarakshan kii samiksha kii baat kahi thi
 But Sangh ideologue Sangeet Ragi, while speaking to 'aaj Tak', supported the reservation for the general class
 vah pichley 70 saalon main garib savarnon ko rigerveshan nahin die jane ke liye congress ko koste hai
 He states that in 1991, however, P
W
 ve
 The Narasimha Rao government undertook to provide reservation to the poor of the general class, but that initiative did not take concrete shape
 sangeet raagi kehete hai ki anya pichhadaa varg main koi ek jati nahin he or na hi anusuchit jati main koi ek khaas jati he
 Similarly, the general class is also not homogenized
 saamaanya varg main bhi kai aise apper cast hai jo ati daliton se bhi bahut garib hai
 Who will worry about them? Is it his only punishment that he was born in an upper cast in this country, his generations must have done so, which he is suffering
 10 fisadi aarakshan ko vah garibon ko mukhya dhara main laane kii kavayad maanate hai
 After 60% reservation, will merit suffer more? Youth for Equality, which praises this move of Modi government, is also no longer talking about merit
 anusuchit jati, janajati or anya pichde varg ke aarakshan ko baisakhi kehane vaala varg bhi usee baisakhi kii sawari karne ko taiyaar he
 But the question is whether the scope of merit will be reduced now? Will the battle for merit be 60 per cent versus 40 per cent? The question also cannot be sidelined that if the new bill becomes law, will it really be justice to the general class or will it just be a tingle? Because according to Arun Jaitley, this 10 percent quota has to go from the share of general category itself

 Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa has written a letter disagreeing on several decisions to break the code of conduct
 is shikaayat par hue vivaad ko mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda ne bekaar or gaiyr jaruri bataaya
 Arora said on Saturday that the controversy over record of a minority decision on the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and a letter sent to him by Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa is useless and unnecessary
 unhone kaha ki is mudde par or isse sambandhit maamalon par charchaa ke liye mangalvaar ko nirvachan ayog kii ek baithak bulaai gai he
 The Chief Election Commissioner described the controversy as useless
 The Chief Election Commissioner said in a statement, "today there is a news of a useless and unwarranted controversy about the internal functioning of the Election Commission of India in relation to dealing with the model code of conduct in a section of the media
 
 " bayaan ke anusaar, "yah vivaad aise samay main paidaa hua he, jab deshbhar main sabhi siio (mukhya chunaav adhikari) or unki timen kal hone vaale saatven or antim charan ke matdaan or uske baad 23 may kii matganana ke liye apni taiyaari main juty hui hai
 "sunil Arora said that in the last meeting of the EC on May 14, it was unanimously decided that certain groups would be formed to deal with the issues faced during Lok Sabha elections 2019, as was done after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 in 13 muddon main adarsh aachaar samhita (emsisi) bhi shaamil tha
 "internal case told Lavasa's letter
 CEC has said that Lavasa's letter on MCC is an internal matter of the Election Commission
 saath hi unhone ye bhi kaha, "yah spasht karnaa aavashyak he ki yah isiai kaa ek aantarik maamla he or is sambandh main kayaasabaaji or anumaan se bachaa janaa chahie
 "arora has said that there have been differences of opinion among the members of the Election Commission in the past as well, but he believes that it is better to remain calm than to create a useless dispute
 unhone ye bhi kaha, "nirvachan ayog ke teenon sadasyon se ek-duusare kaa clon yaa template hone kii apeksha nahin kii ja sakati he
 There have been many times before, which can and should happen, "he said," but such differences have mostly remained within the purview of the ECI till he was relieved
 jab tak ki nirvachan ayuktaon yaa mukhya nirvachan adhikariyon ne use kitabon main nahin likhaa" aroda ne kaha ki jarurat padane par vah kisi saarvajanik bahes se kabhi peeche nahin bhaage, lekin har cheez kaa samay hota he
 He went on to say, "I told a leading daily a few days ago that the language of silence is always difficult, but it is more important to watch the election process, than to create useless disputes" Amit Shah and P

 After Modi got a clean chit, controversy arose in the Election Commission when a clean chit was given on the speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah
 On leaving, Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa disagreed

 Lavasa has insisted in his letter that he will attend the meeting only when his minority decisions are also included in the commission's decisions
 bataa den ki teen sadasyon vaale purna ayog main mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda or do anya ayukta- ashok lavasa or susheel chandra shaamil hai
 On the opposition's target, the Election Commission started getting political response to this dispute
 congress ne ayog par nishaanaa sadhate hue ise modi kaa pitthu bataaya
 The Congress said that it is clear from Ashok Lavasa's letter that CEC and his allies are not ready to record the different opinion between Lavasa about Narendra Modi and Amit Shah

 unase jo raay milegi wo naa sirf party ke menifesto ko sahi myne main piples menifesto banane main madad karegaa, balki isse party ke liye ‘feedbank bank’ taiyaar karne main bhi madad milegi

 sam pitrodane kaha
 'this is the time to think about such a development which first concerns the people standing on the lower rungs
 gujarat main congress kaa jor aise vikaas model par rahegaa jahaan focus garib, kisaan, laghu or majhule udhyamiyon par rahe
 Rahul Gandhi has been asked by the Congress team led by Sam Pitrodaki to gather opinions from different sections
 inamen shiksha, swasthya, kisaanon se jude mudde, laghu or majhule udhyam, awaas aadi ahm hai jinhen menifesto main pramukhataa se sthaan diya ja sake
 Sam Pitrodane clarified that his role is not limited to just preparing the manifesto
 sam pitrodane kaha, ‘mere paas koi rajanithik pojishan nahin he or naa hi main chahta hum
 But if the Congress wins the elections in Gujarat and whoever comes to power, my job will be to put pressure on them to prioritize the work that we are going to promise in our manifesto

 But RLD says that she will not accept less than four seats

 The company, which was accused of defrauding the government and benefiting private companies in association with Kejriwal's former principal secretary Rajendra Kumar, was given the job of outsourcing and manpower outsourcing of contract employees in all departments
 ICSIL company se sabhi sarkari vibhaagon main bharteedilli sarkaar kii cabinet ne sabhi sarkari vibhaagon ko aadesh jari kar diya ki karmchaariyon kii bhartee yaa outsorcing karen to sirf isi company ke jariye or wo bhi bina kisi tender ke
 This was revealed by the secret cabinet note of Kejriwal government which is present with TV Today
 is cabinet note ke mutabik dilli ke mantrimandal ne rajendra kumaar ke taiyaar kiye note ke aadhaar par sabhi sarkari vibhaagon ko ye chhot de di ki wo ICSIL naam kii company se mainpavar kii out sorcing kar sakenge
 Along with this, it was also written in the guide line that for this, departments will not need any tender but all government departments will be able to directly recruit from ICSIL
 ICSIL par rajendra kumaar kii nijee companiyon ko phayda pahunchane kaa aroparichhshil yun to ek public sector under teking he, lekin ye company duusari tamaam nijee companiyon ko apana kaam outsource karti he
 The question on intentions arises because according to the Cabinet note dated October 5, 2015 and another circular dated December 8, 2015, ICSIL was given the right to outsource the tender by the Delhi government
 jabaki isi company par siem kejariwal ke principal secratory rajendra kumaar kii kathith nijee companiyon ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope tha
 The CBI conducted the raid, just a week after the issue of this circular, the CBI raided Rajendra Kumar's office
 kareeb chaar maheene baad rajendra kumaar ko sibiai ne giraftaar bhi kar liya
 After interrogating Rajendra Kumar, CBI also arrested the same company ie ICSIL existing and former MD
 aarope ye laga ki ICSIL ne un nijee companiyon ko phayda pahunchaaya jo kathith taur par rajendra kumaar kii front companiyaan thim
 It is obvious that outsourcing work in all the activities of the Delhi government without getting the tender is raising many questions
 kyonki ye prastaav bhi rajendra kumaar ne hi taiyaar kiya tha
 It is worth mentioning that even during the last Congress government, this fraud was continuing, which was also complained to the CBI
 ICSIL ne dilli ke sarkari mahakamon main kiya bhugtandilli sarkaar ke sarkari mahakamon ke us bhugtan par bhi najar daal lete hai jo ICSIL ko alag-alag vakt par kiya he

25 crore till July 2016

 BJP leader Vivek Garg, who filed a complaint with ACB, BJP leader Vivek Garg has now complained to ACB
 unka daawa he ki ye ek bada ghotaalaa he kyonki ek hi company jis par rajendra kumaar kii nijee companiyon ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope he usko itnaa bada kaam diya janaa sarkaar kii niyat par sawaal uthaata he
 He has now demanded the ACB to conduct an inquiry against the entire Delhi cabinet
 mumbai hamale ke mastermind or jamaat-ud daawa ke chif aatanki hafiz said kii rihaai par kadaa aitraaj jataayaa he
 Now US President Donald Trump has warned Pakistan
 trump ne kaha he ki hafiz said kii rihaai kaa khamiyaja dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko bhugatna padegaa
 Donald Trump's press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement on Saturday, saying, "the US strongly criticizes Saeed's release from detention and demands his immediate arrest
" 'karrwai nahin kii to padegaa rishton par asarbayaan ke mutabik, 'yadi pakistan said par kanoonee rup se karrwai nahin kar saktaa or uske aparaadhon ke liye us par abhiyog nahin laga saktaa to pakistan kii niskriyata kaa khamiyaja donon deshon ke dwipaksheeya sambandhon or pakistan kii vaishvik pratishtha ko bhugatna padegaa
 Sanders said in the statement, "saeed's release after Pakistan failed to prosecute Saeed has sent a wrong message about Pakistan's commitment to combat international terrorism and Pakistan's claims that Pakistan has been proven false Had said that he would not allow his land to be used as a shelter for terrorists
 'said kii rihaai galat kadamasanders ke mutabik, 'raashtrapati donald trump kii dakshin asia niti spasht he ki america, pakistan ke saath rachanaatmak sambandh chahta he lekin iske saath hi vah pakistani dharti par maujuud aatankwaadiyon or aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke khilaaf nirnaayak kadam uthaae jane kii ummid karata he
 Saeed's release is a step in the wrong direction
 'bayaan ke mutabik, america ne lashkar-e-taiyaba ko ek videshi aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kiya he, jo aatankwaadi hamalon main kai nirdosh logon kii maut kaa jimmedaar he
 Many US citizens are also among these victims
 bayaan ke mutabik, 'said khud ek kukhyat aatankwaadi he, jo 2008 ke mumbai hamalon kaa mastermind he, jisamen chah america nagarikon sahit 166 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The US has demanded the second arrest of Hafiz Saeed
 bataa den ki adaalat dwaara said kii hiraasat badhaane se inkaar ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne said kii najarbandi se rihaai ke aadesh die the
 In 2008, the US Department of Finance declared Saeed a specially designated global terrorist and imposed restrictions on him
 bataa den ki pakistani adaalat ne aatanki hafiz ko 22 november ko reeha kiya he
 This boss of terror was under house arrest since 31 January

 One of the few hopes left in his lonely life was his daughter
 chitthee sudur kolkata main netaji ke bhattije shishir kumaar bose ke naam bheji gai thi, par vahaan pahunchane se pehle hi ise padhaa ja chukaa tha
 This was not the first letter that was read
 unke padhane se pehle hi khufia beuro (ibi) ke kai afasaron ne chupchaap chitthee kii pratiyaan banaakar use bose parivaar se judi sikret filon main natthi kar diya tha
 For more than half a century, copies of it and all such letters were kept locked in the drawers of the state IB headquarters in Kolkata
 haal hi main kendriya grih mantralay ne isse gopneeyata kaa mulammaa hataa liya or inhen dilli ke rashtriya abhilekhaagaar main rakhaa gaya he
 These files cover the tainted government rule of independent India
 vah yah he ki 1948 se 1968 ke bich do dashakon tak sarkaar ne bose parivaar ke sadasyon kii gahan jasusi kii thi
 Government spies read and recorded letters from relatives of the freedom fighter who had been Nehru's political colleague for 25 years
 ibi ke jasoos is parivaar ke sadasyon kaa unki gharelu or videsh yatraaon ke dauraan lagaataar peechha karte rahe or unase milane waalon or unki baton ke maheen se maheen vivaranon ko record karte rahe
 This surveillance was on the same lines as is placed on the family of any wanted terrorist today - very dense, systematic and alert
 in khulaason ne bose parivaar ko hairat main daal diya he
 Chandra Kumar Bose, son of Netaji's nephew, raises the question, 'surveillance is kept on those who have committed a crime or who have terrorist wires attached
 netaji or unke parivaar ne aazaadee kii ladaai ladi thi, phir un par nigaraanee rakhane kii kya jarurat thi?'subhash chandra bose kii iklauti putree anita bose-fof germany main arthshaastri hai
 They are also in the know by these revelations

 Soon after, the defeat of the Japanese army in 1944 forced the INA to return
 mana jaataa he ki alide sainya balon ke saamne japan ke ghutane techne ke teen din baad 18 agast, 1945 ko 48 varshiya netaji kii maut taiwan main ek vimaan haadase main ho gai thi
 The Bose family is angry, the Bose family is very angry at these disclosures and demands that the central government should make public the top most confidential files related to Netaji under its possession for the last 60 years
 unka maananaa he ki ye dastaveji rahasyodghatan sirf ek halki-si jhalak hai
 For over a decade, RTI activists and researchers have been of the view that the miraculous inkling of secret files so far could serve to shed some light on the missing person
 sarkaar lagaataar unke kaam main rukaawat daalati rahi he
 When Rajnath Singh was BJP President, last year he said in Cuttack, 'the whole country is restless to know how and under what circumstances Netaji died
 'pichley saal unki saalagirah par bolte hue unhone vaada kiya tha ki agar unki sarkaar satta main aa gai to netaji kii filon ko saarvajanik kar diya jayega
 Today he is in government but his response is similar to UPA

 The PMO has given a similar answer to 'mission Netaji'
 yah kuch kaaryakartaaon kaa ek aisa dabaav samooh he jo 2006 se lagaataar in filon ko saarvajanik kiye jane kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 Bose family espionage The CID in the British Raj had been monitoring the two houses of the Bose family in Kolkata-1 since the 1930s - one was a house at Woodburn Park and the other was 38 @ 2, Elgin Road
 yahi vah samay tha jab sharat chandra or unke chote bhai subhash chandra bose bengal main swatantraaa andolan ke agua banakar ubhare the
 The family got used to the shadow of CID
 iskaa pataa is ghatana se chalata he ki ek baar siidi ke ek afasar ne sharat chandra ko bheje gaye patr ko bich main hi jabt karke uski prati bana lee thi lekin galati se ek prati unhen bhej di
 When he came to the Bose family to admit his mistake, the elder brother asked him to come and take him a few days later
 netaji ko 1941 main najarband kiya gaya tha
 They dodged the police and left the house on Elgin Road and stayed in Nazi-ruled Germany
 angrejon ne unhen iske baad fasivadi takaton kaa sahyogi qaraar dete hue unke parijanon par nigaraanee badha di
 As the documents made public show, the Government of independent India had been vigilantly monitoring this family

 Dhar had stated in his 2005 book Open Secrets that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had ordered the IB to keep an eye on Maneka Gandhi and her family as she suspected the political ambition of the family
 netaji ke do bhatijon shishir kumaar bose or amiy nath bose par jin dinon nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi thi, us samay unka siyaasi vajan zyada nahin tha
 According to the documents, he contested the election several years after the IB loosened his watch over him
 amiy nath ol india forward block ke tikat par arambagh se 1968 main saansad chune gaye jabaki shishir bose congress ke tikat par 1987 main pashchim bengal kii vidhansabha main vidhayak chune gaye the
 It seems that Ib was more interested in what the Bose family does and whom they meet
 saarvajanik ho chuke silsilewar hastlikhit sandesh dikhaate hai ki ibi ke agent ibi mukhyalay ''security control'' ko phone karke parivaar kii harkaton ke bare main jaankaree dete the, haalanki paariwarik patron ke madhyam se hi ibi ko yah pataa chal paata tha ki parivaar kya soch rahaa he
 There was a lot of mention of Netaji in this correspondence
 jaahir he, parivaar or kis bare main baat karegaa? ye patr mote taur par saamaanya paariwarik masalon ke bare main hote the
 Netaji's wife mentioned in his letters the economic crisis of the family, the upbringing of the daughter and the repair of the house in Vienna
 kolkata se bose parivaar kharchaa chalaane ke liye unhen paisa bhejtaa tha
 The IB has outlined in these letters the names of Emily Shankel's visitors
 yah dikhaata he ki ibi ko aakhir kis cheez main dilchaspee thi
 The ib's comment on a similar letter written in 1953 calls Emily "the alleged wife of Mr
 Subhash Chandra Bose"

 She laughs at how effective this spying must have been because the family had no idea of it
 ve kahati hai, ''mere pati kehete the ki aspataal jate samay yaa tram par chadhate vakt unhen mahasoos hota tha ki unka peechha ho rahaa he
 
 
 But it was a matter of the British era
 ''jasusi se jude in rahasyodghatano ko dekhakar ek andaja lagata he ki duniya kii sabase puraani khufia agenciyon main ek ibi kaise kaam kiya karti thi
 The monitoring center for the letters that were seized was almost entirely the Elgin Road Post Office where the Bose family would without doubt cast their letters
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne 1956 main gathit shahanvaj ayog par apana andeh jataayaa tha
 The disappointment stemming from not recognizing uncle was also expressed
 is bare main 1955 main shishir bose ne netaji kii patni ko likhaa tha, ''agar aaj aap bharat main hotin, to aapako yah ehsaas hota ki bharat kii aazaadee kii ladaai main sirf do logon kaa mahatv tha-gandhi or nehru
 Everyone else was unimportant

 This espionage was politically sensitive, there are no two opinions

 These files were kept in steel drawers at ib's state headquarters at Pretoria Street, Kolkata, which is just a few kilometers from Bose's house

 Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Sunday said that after the abolition of special state status to Jammu and Kashmir, people should now pray for the pok to join India while they are there
 unhone ek baithak ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'ham khushkismat hai ki yah (vishesh darje ko radd karnaa) hamaare jeevankaal main hua

 Defending the Centre's decision to abolish the special status enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and divide the state into two union territories, Singh said, "nothing happens overnight

 'pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajya mantri yahaan bhaajapa karyaalay main logon kii sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Several petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the move since the government took effect from early this month, to which Singh said that the decision of the Center could face any legal challenge
 unhone kaha, ‘koi roak kaa aadesh jari nahin hoga
