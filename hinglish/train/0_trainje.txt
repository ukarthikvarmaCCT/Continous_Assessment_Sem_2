 chini company huaave kii america shakha ne haal main washington ke kshetreey adaalat main america vaanijya mantralay par mukadmaa thok diya he
 Huawei is suffering the brunt of the ongoing us-china trade war because the US government has banned it
 haalanki huaave kaa yah mukadmaa ek puraane maamle se sambandhit he
 The case is from the year 2017, according to the news agency IANS
 america vaanijya mantralay ne huaave ke upkarnon ko kabje main liya or der tak is bare main koi nirnay nahin kiya, jise huaave ne avaidh bataaya tha
 In 2017, Huawei transported some telecommunications equipment produced in China, including computer servers, to an independent laboratory in California for examination, according to an appeal document filed in court
 yojananusaar jaanch ke baad in upkarnon ko swadesh waapas lautaaya janaa tha, lekin us saal sitambar main in upkarnon ko china main waapas pahunchane ke raste main america vaanijya mantralay ne niryaat anumati kii jaanch karne kii vajah se unhen alaska state ke ankerage shahar main band kiya gaya
 The appeal document states that after the equipment was captured, Huawei submitted the relevant information as requested and was informed that the institution under the US Ministry of Commerce would normally take a decision regarding export permission within 45 days
 ab tak upkarnon ko america ke kabje main liye gaye 20 se adhik maheene ho gaye, lekin america vaanijya mantralay ne phir bhi koi faisla nahin kiya
 Huawei states that no export permission is required to return equipment produced outside the US to the production country
 chaahe america vaanijya mantralay ke aarambh main upkarnon ko kabje main liye jane kii karrwai galat he yaa nahin, lekin bevajaah vilamb karke upkarnon ko waapas dene kaa uskaa faisla avaidh hi he
 Huwaway requested the US Commerce Ministry to decide whether or not to violate the rule in the transportation of equipment
 agar niyam kaa ulanghan na karne kaa faisla kiya gaya, to america vaanijya mantralay ko upkarnon ko china main waapas pahunchane kii anumati deni chahie
 Significantly, Huawei's relationship with America is not going well
 america sarkaar ne haal main chini company huaave or isaki kai icaayiyon par pratibandh laga diya tha
 These include 35 companies of this group registered in China and Huawei Sri Lanka, Huawei Hong Kong, Huawei Pakistan
 america sarkaar ko lagata he ki chini company huaave america kii jasusi ke liye chini sarkaar ke agent ke taur par kaam kar rahi he or is vajah se america president donald trump ne huaave ke khilaaf kade kadam uthaae hai
 After canceling Huawei in the US, Google canceled the Android license from Huawei
 google ne kaha tha ki usne huaave ke liye android kaa license khud se cancil nahin kiya he, balki google america commers department ke aadesh kaa paalan kar rahi he

 On Tuesday, the new army chief in Pakistan, General Qamar Javed Bajwa took command and General Rahil Sharif was given a farewell
 lekin mangalvaar ko hi jammu main jis tarah tabadatod aatanki hamale hue, usne pakistan ke napak mansoobon kaa bhi ishaara de diya he
 Terrorist attacks took place at two different places in Jammu during the crowning of the new army chief in Pakistan
 in hamalon main bhartiya sena ke 8 jawan shahid ho gaye
 It is difficult to believe that the coronation of the new general and the terror conspiracies in Jammu should have any relation
 kyonki pakistan army ke nae mukhiya, puraane general ke bhi bharosemand hai
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif could also make Bajwa the new army chief
 
 
 jab unki pasand ko mangalvaar ko hi army pad se ritair hue raahil sharif ne bhi hari jhandi dikhaai
 Nawaz Sharif chose Bajwa as the 16th Army Chief of the Pakistani Army, who was said to have been a 'low profile' officer
 bajva kii niyukti par muhar lagane ke baad pakistani media ne bhi kaha ki bajva ko isliye chunaa gaya kyonki piem navaj sharif aisa army chif chaahate the jo military ke kaam kaa export to ho lekin desh main loktantr kaa bhi samarthak ho
 Bajwa has been the head of the training wing in the Pakistani Army
 saath hi wo pakistani sena ke 10wein kor ke commander bhi rah chuke hai
 Corps 10 is that part of the Pakistani Army which is deployed along the border with India and on the Line of Control
 itnaa hi nahin bajva par elosi se sate uttari ilaakon main force commander kii jimmedaari bhi rahi he
 Bajwa has had a long experience on the Kashmir issue and this is perhaps the reason why expectations have started flowing from Pakistan after his appointment
 pakistan main visheshgy maan rahe hai ki maujuuda halaat main bajva bharat ko munhtod jawaab dene ke liye sabase sahi commander sabit honge
 After these facts, Bajwa's coronation and the relationship of double terror attack in Jammu itself tells its story
 itnaa hi nahin ritairement se ain pehle raahil sharif bhi bajva ko sajeesh kaa apana mantra de chuke hai
 Rahil Sharif had said 5 days before retirement that India's books would not be forgotten if Pakistan made a surgical strike
 bharat apni aane vaali pidiyon ko silebus main padhayega ki sargical strike ke myne kya hote hai
 When Rahil was retiring, then what was the meaning of this jackal bhabki
 kya ye nae general ko sandesh tha ki use bharat ke sargical strike kaa badla lenaa he, jo raahil sharif nahin le sake
 Are the terrorist attacks in Jammu on the day of Pakistan's new general Qamar Bajwa assuming the beginning of this conspiracy

 netixara ke das-baarah saalon main kahani kii duniya main bahut kuch nayaa judaa he
 In the meantime, a generation of storytellers has appeared that has brought the story and life parallel to each other
 rajeev kumaar isi peedi ke ek vishisht kathakaar hai
 Tezaab is Rajiv Kumar's first anthology collection, with a total of seven stories
 saaton kahaniyaan usee samay main ghatati hai jahaan ek taraf to tarakkee ke bade-bade daawey hai, vishwashakti banane ke sapane hai, vahiin duusari taraf din-ba-din tuutate-bikharate yuva hai
 At the heart of Rajiv's stories are the youth - the dull and the unemployed
 chamakate hue vigyapni bharat ke barakes in yuvaaon kaa tej roj-ba-roj ksheen ho rahaa he
 Their faces are turning black, they are slowly breaking, disintegrating, falling alone, being destroyed
 unka saamaajik vyaktitv nasht ho rahaa he, ve ek cockroach main badal rahe hai
 It is not that he is the first narrator to give voice to the suffering and unemployment of the youth, but in his stories these things come with full awfulness rather than being romanticized, often in the form of salacious commentaries
 ye tippaniyan bhi lekhak kam uske charitra zyada karte hai
 These characters have more to say than say their lives
 sheershak kahani tejaab main kathavachak kaa pita apni raajnneetik bisaat par uskaa upyog bhar karne kii koshish karata he, jab use pataa chalata he ki kathavachak uske virdohi vidhayak kii bhatiji se prem karata he
 So he supports the narrator but this support only lasts until he wins the election
 yah bhayanak he ki pita khud bete ko kisi ladki se sambandh banane or phir use chhod dene ko uksaae kyonki vah kathith rup se nimna jati kii he
 Rajiv's stories also explore the standing of negative collectivism against positive collectivism
 ek mahavidhyalay main chaatrasangh ke chunaav ko lekar likhi gai sangrah kii ek or kahani bisaat bhi yaheen pahunchati he ki jab tak hamaari chetana tamaam tarah ke purvagrahon kii girvee he or hamane tarah-tarah ke ghrunit mahadhishon ko apni chetana kaa sauda karne kii khuli chhot de rakhi he tab tak loktantric sambhaavnaaon kaa koi arth nahin bachaa he
 Kareena Kapoor's photo or stories like Cockroaches, Albums or Overbridge are also at the center of youth, who have been left amidst all the ramifications of democracy
 yahaan chunavi sandarbh nahin hai par loktantr yaa aadhuniktaa virdohi shaktiyaan zyada maheen str par kaam kar rahi hai
 Unfriendliness among friends is taking place and all possibilities of positive collectivity are being destroyed forever (overbridge)
 jahaan swasth or sundar sapane kuntha or beemaari main badal rahe hai (elbum, cockroach or karina kapur kaa photo) or parivaar jahaan paariwarik sampatti main apana hissaa lene ke liye or vasiyat ke prabhavi hone ke liye ghar ke bujurg kii mrityu kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he (mrityu utsav)
 For this, opponents also call their differences and collectively await death

 While the political rhetoric on GST continues, at the same time, even after changes in it, the path of the government does not appear to be easy
 jiesti ke badlaav se mili raahat ko jahaan vipakshi dal kam bataa rahe hai, vahiin kuch chizon ke tex rate main kami hone par maamla ab court pahunch gaya he
 a petition has been filed in the Delhi High Court
 ye yachika senetary napkin par 12 fisadi kaa jiesti lagane ke khilaaf lagaai gai he
 The court, while hearing this, has sought answers from the central government
 sanetary napkin tex free kyon nahinhai court ne centre sarkaar se poocha he ki jab kaajal, bidin or sindur ko tex free kiya ja saktaa he to phir senetary napkin par 12 fisadi kaa jiesti lagane kii kya tuk he
 At the same time, the court has also asked whether the government is in a position to reduce the tax or not
 The government has given this argument on the notice of the court, the central government has submitted its affidavit
 isamen sarkaar ne court ko kaha he ki senetary napkin ke liye ro material aayaat kiya jaataa he
 Also, there are some practical problems due to which it is currently not possible for the government to remove 12 percent GAT
 yachikakarta ne uthaae manshaa par sawalayachikakarta ne centre sarkaar kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki jiesti kaa pratishat tay karne vaali cameti main kisi bhi mahila ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, recently, the government has also reduced the GST rate on about 200 more products, including chocolate
 unhone kaha ki agar chocolate par jiesti kam kiya ja saktaa he to phir sanetary napkin par kyon nahin?yachikakarta kii daleelcourt main yachikakarta ne daleel dete hue kaha he ki desh main mahilaon kaa ek bada tabaka sanetary napkin kaa istemaal nahin kar paaegaa kyonki jiesti lagane se ye or mahangaa ho gaya he
 He also said that due to inflation a large section does not use sanitary napkins and is not even aware
 aise main sanetary napkin mahange hone se jo log istemaal kar rahe hai unki pahunch se bhi dur ho jayega
 On 14 December, the next hearing, the petitioner also said in the court that the goods like condom, including sindoor and bangles have been completely exempted from GST
 jabaki mahilaon ke swasthya se judi mahatvapurn vastu sanetary napkin par jiesti lagaai ja rahi he
 The High Court will now hear the case on 14 December

 The son of a Maya Enclave resident family was born on January 23, 2017, with heart disease, which could be treated as soon as possible so that the child could survive

 When i could not get help from anywhere, i tweeted PMO, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Health Minister and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 
 
 mujhe kuch hi ghante baad sushamaa ji ne khud jawaab diya
 
 
 "that period of shero-shayari between Sushma Swaraj and former PM Manmohan Singh, of life and death

 He not only ensured my son's immediate surgery, but he did not forget to meet me in person when he came to the same hospital for followup after his kidney transplant
 unhone mujhase bete ke swasthya ke bare main jaankaree lee, or vaada kiya ki uskaa namakaran vahi karengi
 
 
 She has gone out of the world, and i feel, no family member

 " jaipur ke sachivalay main 23 june ko maano is khabar ke par lag gaye ki mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne 26 june kii landan kii prastaavit yatra radd kar di he
 Raje had to meet investors there to make the Resurgent Rajasthan event to be held this year in the state a success
 yatra radd karne ke peeche jaipur main niti ayog kii baithak kaa bahaanaa banaaya gaya, jo jaldi hi pakad main aa gaya
 The visit was canceled due to Lalit Modi's strong presence in London
 raaje tabhi se chautarafa ghiri hui hai, jab se 2011 kii vah chitthee saamne ai he, jisamen unhone british adhikariyon ko die gaye indian premier lig (ipiel) ke purv kamisionar ke avrajan aavedan kaa anumodan karte hue dastakhat kiye the
 Raje's "hard condition" to approve this application was that Indian officials were not aware of his assistance
 unhen dar tha ki unke rajnatik virdohi is chitthee kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The letter was made of his neck, just as he had feared
 isane dhaulpur kii namdhari maharani ko alag-thalag or siyaasi taur par kamjor kar diya he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj may have been the first target after a British newspaper revealed on 7 June about supporting Lalit Modi to travel outside the country
 lekin takreeban hafte bhar main hi raaje vivaad kii jad main aa gayi
 Worse was that all BJP veterans & party president Amit Shah, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who came forward to save Swaraj, were silenced when it came to save Raje
 vivaad bhadakne ke ek saptaah baad 22 june ko sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantri nitin gadakari jaipur pahunche or raaje kaa bachaav kiya
 However, Lalit Modi, who refused to return to India for Enforcement Directorate (ED) interrogation, also sparked protests in BJP over Swaraj and Raje's help

 K
 singh ne lalit modi ko “bhagauda” kehane se gurej nahin kiya
 Raje initially denied having any information about the document, but when the Congress submitted a copy of it along with Raje's signatures and sought Raje's resignation, the BJP said it would study the document and the situation Will give statement only after rajasthan congress ke pramukh sachin payalat kehete hai, “unhone na sirf ek bhagaude kii madad kii, balki ise chhipaana bhi chaahati thim, kyonki ve jaanati thim ki ve galat kar rahi hai
 This behavior of a person holding a constitutional post is objectionable
 ” sharmindagi se ghiri sarkaar ne idi se kaha he ki vah lalit modi ko bharat laane or un par aapraadhik maamla chalaane kii karrwai tej kare (dekhen boxh aakhir kasne laga jaanch kaa fanda)
 When Raje gave this affidavit, she was the leader of the opposition

 After the controversy broke out, he reshuffled long-serving bureaucrats and police officers
 raaje yakeenan man hi man tajjub karne se khud ko roak nahin paati hongi ki jis shaks ne unke kandhon par chadhakar ek had tak gumnami ke dhundhalake se antarrashtriya khyaati tak oonchi chalaang lagaai, vahi aaj unheen ke pairon se jameen khiskaane kii dhamkee de rahaa he
 Amit Shah sought an official explanation from Raje on his affidavit
 raaje ne pehle shah se kaha ki vah lalit modi ko jaanati to thim, lekin unhone kisi dastavej par dastakhat nahin kiye the
 BJP leaders say their future will be decided only after Raje's response to the latest controversy
 raaje ne haalanki pad chhodane kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya he
 He has told the party leaders that he had helped Lalit Modi in his personal capacity and not as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 “puraane paariwarik rishte”raaje ne lalit modi ke bare main saarvajanik taur par mushkil se hi kabhi baat kii he, lekin itnaa maanati hai ki unke parivaar ko ve lambey samay se jaanati hai
 The depth of the relationship between the dynasty's heirs and the business nobles is also known from Lalit Modi's statement given to the British immigration authorities
 isamen raaje ko unhone “purana paariwarik dost” bataaya
 Modi wrote in his statement, "vasundhara's family and my family have been close for many years
 unki maa or meri daadi bahut kareebi dost thim
 Another story is told that Modi's wife Meenal was Raje's school friend
 lekin jaipur ke siyaasi halkon main modi kaa naam 2004 main hi sunai diya
 Only a few months before that, Raje, who was a junior minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet, led his party to a landslide victory in the December 2003 assembly elections
 gwalior ke aakhri maharaja jorge jivaji raav sindhiya or vijaya raaje sindhiya kii beti vasundhara raaje rajasthan kii yathasthitivaadee raajnneeti main taaja hawa ke jhonke kii tarah thim
 She came across as a leader full of new ideas to repair the state's tourism industry and the ruined monuments, boost shabby power generation and fix random city planning
 lekin tabhi jaipur vikaas praadhikaran ke galiyaaron main fusfusaahaton main ek or naam liya jane laga
 In 2004, real estate companies accused officers and leaders of raising bribes in exchange for changing the land use of agricultural land for industrial purposes
 fusfusaahaton main kaha jane laga ki mumbai ke kaarobaari lalit modi kaa naam lekar kehete hai ki rajasthan main kaam karwaane ke liye yahi sahi aadmi he
 Lalit Modi first made headlines in 2005, when he was elected President of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA)
 usase pehle tak aaarasie par congress se jude jis kishor ruungta parivaar kaa dabadabaa tha, use hataane or uski jagah lene ke liye puri chunaav prakriya ko itani safai or gopneeyata se anjaam diya gaya ki sarkari afasar bhi sakate main aa gaye
 Lalit Modi's administrative acumen fascinated Raje
 unhone jaipur ke khastahal savai maansingh stadium ko antarrashtriya cricket maichon ke pasandida sthal main badal diya
 The successful start of IPL in 2008 put Modi in the queue of cricket giants with a big jump
 jin logon kii ahmiyat thi, unhen modi ne ipiel ke muft paas dekar yaa unke bacchon ko moti tankhwaah kii naukariyaan dekar saadh liya
 For others, he was close to the Chief Minister, which he used to show off very well
 ve afasaron ko dhamkaane ke liye cellphone se khuleam “vasu” ko kol karte or maamuli baton par iees or ipies afasaron se ulajh padate
 As he climbed, rumors began to circulate about the senior bureaucrats in the state visiting him in Modi's suite at the Rambagh Palace Hotel in Jaipur
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kehete hai, “lalit modi vasundhara raaje ke bhrashtachar ke pratik hai
 "it is perhaps the effect of the feudal state of Rajasthan at one time that people do not trust whisper about misuse of power as easily as they accept any power
 modi tab tak taqatvar samvidhanetar satta ban chuke the, jinaki ahmiyat ne bijepi or aresas ke kaaryakartaaon ko haashie par dhakel diya tha
 Local middlemen and those lobbying for real estate expressed their displeasure at losing their business to the new companies, which they accused of their association with raje-modi
 disambar, 2008 main raaje jab chunaav main utrin, tab tak modi se unki najdiki ke khilaaf virodh kii antardhara musaladhar barish main badal chuki thi
 RSS and BJP workers either remained apathetic or acted against them
 raaje chunaav haar gayi
 It was around this time that Modi opened business deals one after the other with Raje's son Dushyant Singh
 modi kii company anand heritage hotels privet limited ne dushyant singh kii company niyant heritage hotels pra
 Ltd
 (enechaechapiel) main nivesh kiya (dekhen box)
 These were the investments that the Congress is referring to as black money transactions

 Modi lost the RCA election in 2009, as his allies were now relegated to Congress-backed candidates
 sitambar 2010 main unhen bisisiai se bhi nikaal baahar kiya gaya
 a few months later, he fled to London, fearing to be questioned in the custody of the ED, who had registered several cases against him in India (see box)

 Modi, while refusing to return to India, had cited threats to his life from threats from the Mumbai underworld

 Raje is said to have refused, as he was nominated as the chief ministerial candidate for the 2013 election
 modi bisisiai main unke kattar virdohi arun jetali ke saath raaje kii najdiki ko lekar man hi man khaulane lage
 In 2013, Jaitley was the chairman of the BCCI Discipline Committee, which blamed Modi for financial irregularities, fraudulent bidding and unauthorized selling of TV rights
 raaje jetali kii ehsaanmand thim, kyonki unhone unki siem kii ummidavaari ke liye aresas, bijepi or pradhanmantri pad ke liye manonith narendra modi kaa samarthan dilwane main madad kii thi
 It is said that he had accepted the rss's advice to stay away from Lalit Modi
 modi may 2014 main landan main rahete hue aaarasie ke adhyaksh chune gaye, lekin ve in badalte hue samikarnon se nawakif the
 He hoped that he would again dominate Rajasthan, as his old friends returned to the post of Chief Minister
 jaipur main melbern cricket ground kii vishaal shandaar nakal banane kaa unka sapana tab dhul main mil gaya, jab raaje ne aaarasie ko jameen kaa hastantaran roak diya
 The gap between Raje and Modi widened in October 2014 when Amin Pathan, a local BJP leader from Kota and a long-time Modi ally, took his place in the election
 pathan kaa kahana tha ki modi ke adhyaksh bane rahane kii vajah se bisisiai aaarasie ke saath achhut kii tarah bartaav kar rahi he
 Modi, in a series of tweets, accused Raje's colleagues of a coup against him
 raaje ne yah kahkar khud ko alag kar liya ki ve khel sansthaaon main dakhal nahin deteen
 In March this year, Pathan also thwarted Modi's second attempt to take over
 yah aakhri keel sabit hua
 Modi understood that he could no longer trust Raje
 jab vivaad saamne aayaa, tab modi ke mumbai sthit vakil mahmud abdi ne, jinhen khud bhi aaarasie ke upaadhyaksh ke pad se hataa diya gaya tha, modi kaa samarthan karne vaala halafanama jari kiya
 The focus shifted from Swaraj to Raje

 On June 24, BJP joint secretary (organization) Saudan Singh and the party's new general secretary Arun Singh held a closed-door conversation with Raje and supported him with the RSS and BJP
 party ke bheetar charchaa yah he ki philhal raaje surakshit hai
 However, the controversy has led to a split in the leadership
 gadakari or rajnath singh unke mukhyamantri bane rahane ke haq main hai
 Each other section of BJP leaders feel that this has shocked the image of the party and if the decisive action is not taken in this matter of misconduct, then the credibility of PM Narendra Modi will come down

 Still, it cannot hide the fact that the current crisis has weakened Raje

 On the one hand, the decision of demonetisation taken by the central government still remains a matter of discussion, while expensive weddings are still a matter of dispute among the families of the leaders amid this decision
 aisi hi ek shaadi guuruuvaar ko aurangabad main dekhne ko mili jo maharashtra bhaajapa ke adhyaksh ravsahab daanve ke bete or vidhayak santosh daanve kii thi
 In this marriage, big political stalwarts of various parties had arrived from the state

 'there are also many objections being raised about such an expensive marriage
 saamaajik kaaryakarta anjali damaniya ne kadi pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha he ki ‘mujhe aashcharya ho rahaa he ki aisi kharchili shaadi ke liye paisa kahaan se aata he
 According to media reports, around Rs 6-7 crore has been spent in this wedding
 kisaan netaa jayaji suryavanshi ne aarope lagaaya he ki logon ke paas pine ke liye pani nahin he or is shaadi main do din main 500 tanker pani zamin par chhidaka gaya
 However, this marriage is in discussion not because of the arrival of these big celebrities, but because of the expenses incurred in it
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kareeb 5-6 acre main shaadi kaa shaamiyana sajaayaa gaya tha
 Along with the big celebrities, arrangements were made for the food of one and a half lakh people and different types of dishes were arranged for the guests

 Former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi was declared bankrupt by a London court for failing to pay 65,000 pounds (about Rs 53 lakh) to a private security company
 ‘da telegraph’ kii report ke mutabik yah aadesh pichley maheene diya gaya or yah faisla us samay aayaa he jab modi sanyas le chuke newjiland ke olerounder kris kerns ke unke khilaaf daayar manahani ke mukademe ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Modi is owed this fee for services provided in 2010 by Page Group, an international security company
 ipel ke is purv ayukta ne apane bachaav main kaha, ‘‘aadesh die jane tak mujhe bilkul bhi jaankaree nahin thi ki mere upar koi raashi bakaayaa he
 No demand was made before me, but when i came to know of this, i offered to deposit the money in the court but for some reason the company concerned refused it
 ’’ ab landan main rahane vaale bisisiai ke purv upaadhyaksh modi ko lagata he ki yah suraksha company kaa sasti lokapriyata hasil karne kaa prayaas he
 Company President Stuart Page said, "it is unfortunate that we reached this position but Modi left no other option for us
" hamane modi ko unke or unke parivaar ke khilaaf dhamkiyon ke silsile main kai suraksha sevaayen muhaiyaa karai
 We gave them many bills which were not paid
 ’’ tippaniyan Subsequently, the court hearing the case relating to the cancellation of the order declaring former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi bankrupt adjourned the hearing as the lender did not provide evidence to support his claim

" mujhase isse pehle koi maang nahin kii gai lekin jab mujhe iskaa pataa chalaa to maine paisa adaalat main jamaa karaane kii peshkash kii lekin kisi kaaran se sambandhit company ne isse inkaar kar diya
 Now Modi, a former BCCI vice-president living in London, feels that this is an attempt by the security company to gain cheap popularity
 company ke adhyaksh stuart pej ne kaha, ‘‘yah durbhaaguparn he ki ham is sthiti main pahunche lekin modi ne hamaare liye koi or vikalp nahin choda
 We provided many security services to Modi in connection with threats against him and his family
 hamane unhen kai bill die jinka bhugtan nahin kiya gaya

 The Aam Aadmi Party may have tried to control the damage in the Kumar Vishwas case by suspending Amanatullah Khan from the party, but the BJP has bombarded you with questions
 bijepi ko aap ke andruni sankat ke samaadhaan main bhi kisi samjhaute kii ashanka nazar aa rahi he
 BJP National Minister RP Singh has said that there is a secret agreement on Kumar Vishwas in the Aam Aadmi Party as the entire episode of Amanatullah appears scripted
 amanatullah ke bayaan kii aad main wo mulya sawaal dabaa die gaye, jo kumaar vishwaas ne apane video main uthaae the
 Kumar Vishwas questioned Kejriwal's leadership - RP Singh: According to RP Singh, Kumar Vishwas still maintains what was said in his video, meaning the Aam Aadmi Party has not given any clarification on corruption and disturbances within AAP
 Nor has the answer to the questions raised by faith come
 kyonki kumaar vishwaas ne na sirf kejariwal ke netritv par sawaal uthaae the, balki kai aisi baton ko saamne laayaa tha, jo aap ke netaaon ke aacharan ko katghare main khadaa kar rahi thim, lekin kejariwal or unki puri team neemantullahkaa maamla saamne laakar un sawaalon ko peeche dhakel diya

 He accused the AAP of corruption, questioned Kejriwal's leadership and excluded Amanatullah
 All is part of an agreement

 The general public stuck in a state of chaos over GST is now embroiled in the question of how much tomatoes should be eaten
 ji haa, dilli main in dinon tamaato kii jo keemten bani hui hai usamen ye sawaal vaazib bhi he
 Tomato prices are skyrocketing in the country's capital Delhi these days
 hafte bhar pehle 30 se 40 rupee kilo bikne vaala tamaato in dinon 60 rupee kilo tak bik rahaa he
 Let us know that these prices are of the retail market
 pahadganj kii khudrasabji mandimein buudhvaar ko tamaato 60 rupye kilo bika
 According to the shopkeepers, the same tomatoes were sold up to 40 rupees a week ago, but prices have suddenly increased due to reduced arrival of tomatoes in wholesale markets of Delhi
 pahadganj mandi main tamaato bechney vaale mahesh ke mutabik thok mandi main tamaato kii ek carat 300 rupye kii aa rahi thi wo ab 1200 rupye prati carat tak pahunch chuki he
 According to traders, tomatoes come from Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, but these days the arrival of tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh remains regular, due to which tomatoes are getting less in Delhi's mandis
 vahintmatarakhridane aaye log bhi badi hui keemton se khaase naaraaz hai
 Govind, who lived in the RK Ashram area, had come to take 1 kg of tomatoes, but he only bought half a kg of tomatoes after hearing the price
 abhi bani rahegi oonchi keemtenvyapaariyon ke mutabik agle ek hafte tak tamaato kii keemton main giravat kii ummid kam hi he kyonki ab barish ke chalate subjiyon ke parivahan main kai baar rukaawat aati he to vahiin zyada barish ke kaaran fasal kharaab hone par bhi subjiyan nahi aa paatin
 In such a situation, prices are likely to remain high till there is not enough stock of tomatoes in Delhi

 is varsh kii shuruyaat main logon ke baari utsaah ke bich, do dashak main pehali baar sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav karaae gaye the
 There is a similar atmosphere in the country these days, in which elections to the lower house of parliament and the assembly of seven new states are being held in two phases
 ye chunaav aitihaasik hai, kyonki vahaan aakhirkaar sangheey ganatantric samvidhan ko lagu kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa masauda taiyaar karne main saat kathin varsh lag gaye or do samvidhan sabhaaon ke chunaav karaane pade
 However, in the hilly region where the first round of polling took place on 26 November, there was a ten per cent drop compared to local elections
 saat disambar ko jab desh ke baaki hisse main matdaan honge, yahi rujhaan rahata he, to nattejey kuch apratyaashit rah sakate hai
 Despite this, the coalition of Communist parties Unified maoist-leninist (amale) and former Maoist rebels is expected to get the next government-forming seats but the surprising results cannot be ruled out
 haalanki do maheene pehle vampanthi gathbandhan kaa elaan hua to log hairaan the, kyonki haal ke varshon tak in partiyon ke bich katu pratidwandvita thi
 But now they are ready to merge with electoral constraints
 unki mukhya virdohi sattarudh nepali congress ko jabardastee choti partiyon ke saath kahin adhik anaupchaarik chota-sa gathbandhan karne ko majaboor hona padaa

 is maamle main hai court me ek yachika daayar kii gai he, jis par sunwaayee karte hue court ne esadmasi or dilli sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 In this case, a fourth class student has filed a petition through his mother

 The court has sought a response from the SDMC and the Delhi government in this matter in 4 weeks
 maamle main agali sunwaayee 8 november ko hogi
 In this petition, a student studying in the fourth class at Primary School, Katwariya Sarai of SDMC has said that more than 6 months have passed since the new academic session started
 lekin use abtak paanch notebook or ek drawing book kii di gai he, jo ki niyamon ke tahat puri nahin he
 At the same time, every child is given 500 rupees for the uniform, that money has not even been received
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki 500 rupee uniform ke liye kaaphi kam he
 Not only this, giving 500 rupees to these children by giving uniforms is wrong because their poor family can misuse this money
 jabaki esadmasi or idiemasi or dilli sarkaar apane skool main padhane vaale bacchon ko uniform ke liye 500 rupee har saal detii he
 Tawde also stressed on giving special training to teachers to deal with the current policy

 However, now according to Sri Lankan media it is being told that this curfew has been increased
 bataa den ki 21 april ko hue aatmghaatee hamale main kareeb 253 log maare gaye the
 ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack
 haalanki, sthaneey charampanthi sanghathanon par hamale ke aarope lage the
 The burqa was also banned in Sri Lanka after this attack
 ab dange bhadakne ke baad soshal media par bhi bain laga diya gaya he
 Sri Lankan police say the mob was attacked after a Facebook post of a Muslim shopkeeper in the west coastal city of Chila
 bheed dwaara ek masjid or muslimon kii kuch dukaanon par hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 So far one person has died in this attack
 jabaki easter par teen girjagharon or teen lakjri hotalon main hue aatmghaatee hamalon main 253 logon kii maut ho gai thi or 500 se adhik log ghayal ho gaye the

 pakistan main ghuskar indian army ke sargical strike ne asar dikhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 Even though Pakistan is denying any surgical strike, the entire Pakistani system is shaken inside
 bharat ke aakraamak rukh kaa asar ye hua he ki ek taraf jahaan pioke samet kai ilaakon main aatanki campon ke khilaaf virodh-pradarshan ho rahe hai vahiin pakistan kii sarkaar ne khufia agency iesai or sena par aatankiyon kii madad rokane kaa dabaav bhi badha diya he
 The process of removing the isi's DG is going to begin, the first thing to fall is on Pakistan's intelligence agency isi's DG Rizwan Akhtar
 pakistan ke akhbaar 'da nesan' kii report ke anusaar jald hi iesai ke diji hataae ja sakate hai
 The process for this has also started
 rigwan akhtar ko 2014 main pakistani khufia agency kii kaman saunpi gai thi
 However, the Army has still denied any such changes
 aatankiyon ko sharan detii he isigorawalaba he ki pakistan main iesai or sena hi bharat ke khilaaf aatankiyon ko sharan dene kaa pramukh jariya hai
 But after the India case strike, the demand for stopping the help of terrorist forces in Pakistan is increasing
 sargical strike ko nakaarta rahaa he pakgorawalaba he ki 28-29 sitambar kii raat bhartiya sena ne pioke main ghuskar sargical oparation kiya tha or aatanki thikaanon or lonching pads ko tabah kiya tha
 In this operation, more than 50 terrorists were killed by the Indian Army and the Pakistani army which came to their rescue had also caused heavy losses
 bharat ne is sargical oparation kaa khuleam elaan kar apni kootneeti ke saath hi badale hue videsh niti kaa sanket bhi diya
 After this the Pakistani rulers rejected it outright but the increased political activity across the border is making these claims of Pakistan false
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 Inside Story of Surgical Strike But Why Is Panicked PAK After the surgical operation, the Government of Pakistan convened a special session of Parliament and also passed the resolution on Kashmir
 iske alaava tamaam vipakshi dalon ne navaj sharifsarkaar ko gheraa
 Even a member of Nawaz's party has asked the question, why is Pakistan raising terrorists like Hafiz Saeed? Then India will do a surgical strike! Meanwhile, news came that to discuss the situation arising in Pakistan regarding security
 In the meeting called by Nawaz Sharif, the Chief Minister of Pakistan's Punjab province reprimanded the ISI Chief and whipped heavily for his policy of helping the terrorists
 punjab praant ke siem shahbaaj sharif ne pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii maujuudagi main hi iesai ke mahanideshak general rigwan akhtar ko sakht chetavanee bhare andaaj main kaha ki agar aapane aatankiyon par nakel nahin lagaai to antarrashtriya jagat pakistan ko alag-thalag kar degaa
 After this, Pak NSA Nasir Janjua is believed to have asked Rizwan Akhtar to visit the four border states and order to rein in the terrorists
 saath hi bhitarkhaane ye bhi khabar he ki agar pakistan ne aatankiyon par nakel nahin kasi toindian army ek baar phir sargical strike kii taiyaari main he
 Rahil Sharif will retire in November, General of Army Chief of Pakistan Pakistan Rahil Sharif will retire after two months i
e
 on 26 November
 jabaki navaj sharif kii satta kii umr abhi paune do baras bachi hui he
 But Rahil Sharif has started making such arrangements on the go
 jisase pakistan main pradhanmantri sena ke haathon kii katputli bane rahe
 There are five army officers, one of whom will become Pakistan's general after November
 lekin sargical strike ke baad pench fansaa hua he
 The big question is whether Rahil Sharif will leave Sharafat

 The iphone 8 and iphone 8 Plus do not have any significant changes and can be seen as an upgrade to the iphone 7 and 7 plus
 lekin iphone x puri tarah se alag he or isamen nai chijen di gai hai
 what's new
 nayaa ye he ki isamen oled disple he
 The new one is that it has facial recognition
 nayaa ye he ki isamen bina bejal kii disple he
 The new one is that there is nothing or nothing in it
 baharhaal yah ek khubasurat smartphone he
 There was a time when Apple set the trend
 khaas karsmartphone ke maamle main aipal kii copiki jaati thi
 But after the Apple event, it seems that the company does not currently have any technology to deliver it to the iphone that can differentiate it from other smartphones
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki iphone kii qualoty dusron se behatar he, dizin bhi acha he or ios 11 main behtareen fitures bhi hai
 But will the new iphone be able to compete with other smartphones due to this? Only time will tell whether its sales make new records or get the tag of the flop
 main iphone yujar hum or nishchit taur par iphone x kharidoongaa bhi
 But not because any revolutionary changes have been made in this smartphone
 lekin isliye ki yah mujhe nijee taur par pasand he
 Looking at the previous iphone, its sales have decreased compared to the iphone 6 series
 isaki vajah duusari smartfones companiyaan hai jo lagaataar nae innovative fitures dekar aipal ke hardkor customers ko bhi apni taraf aakarshith kar rahe hai
 For example, you can take MI Mix 2, the recent smartphone of Chinese company Xiaomi
 company ne is smartphone main koi bejal nahin rakhaa he or iskaa dizin bhi prabhavit karata he
 With the claim, it can be said that it can compete with the iphone 8 series, at least in terms of design and display
 agar aap aipal dwaara pichley kuch saalon main kiye gaye bade elaan ko dhyaan se dekhen to inamen aapako aisa kuch nahin milegaa jisase ye kaha ja sake kii company ne koi krantikari product yaa feechar launch kiya he
 For example, you can take the iphone 7 series only
 dual camera dene or headphone jaik hataane ke alaava kamobesh inamen kuch aisa nahin tha jo duusare smartfones main na ho
 The same goes with the ipad
 dizin par aate hai
 Talking about the design of iphone 8, 8 Plus and iphone X, its solid build quality is also beautiful to look at
 lekin nayaa kya he isamen? kya market main aisi body vaala smartphone nahin he? isaseb behatar dizin vaale phone mil jaaenge
 Face ID - Apple may call it better, but for a common customer, this feature is not completely new
 samsung ne apane flagshaphi Note 8 main iris scinar ore facial ricognishan feechar diya he
 Therefore, you cannot call it new technology or a surprising feature
 virusel charging kai saal pehle se hi samsung or duusari companiyaan apane flagship products main detii ai hai
 a low bezel display is also not new
 shaomi ne pichley saal hi MI Mix launch karke duniya bhar ko chaunkaaya
 Because there were almost no bezels in it
 water pruf - aise smartphone kii bharmaar
 Take Samsung's flagship phablet Galaxy Note 8
 baari barish main ise aap note kii tarah yuj kar sakate hai
 For example, if you want to write something, then you can write s Pen and write it in water too
 in sab ke baavjood iphone ek behatarani smartphone sabit hoga
 But sales may be affected
 market main damdaar pratidwantdiyon kii bharmaar he
 Samsung has been designing its flagship in such a way that people are liking it since last year
 Galaxy S8 ho yaa Note 8 ye donon behtareen divaais hai
 Apart from this, Google is now ready with its Pixel 2 smartphone and soon the company will announce it
 isliye aipal ke nae yphone kaa rasta inta asana nahin hoga jitna pehle hota tha
 a heartbreaking murder case has come up in Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh
 jahaan ek kinnar ne apane premi yuvak kaa katl kar uski laash ko ghar main hi thikaane laga diya
 When the foul smell started coming from his room, the people around complained

 He had rented a room in the house of Mohammad Zakir, a resident of the village
 chandani kinnar ke paas uskaa 28 varshiya premi wasim bhi rahane laga
 All was going well that suddenly, 3 weeks ago, the moonlight eunuch went away giving the land key to his landlord
 jane se pehle usne makaan maalik jakir ko bataaya ki wasim kahin baahar gaya hua he
 Therefore, he is also going out of some work
 pichley do din se chandani ke kamare se durgandh aane lagi
 People nearby and the landlord Zakir suspected something
 somvaar ko jakir ne jab chandani kaa cameraa kholkar dekha to use vahaan rakhaa ek plastic kaa drum dikhaai diya
 His senses flew as soon as he saw the drum
 usamen wasim kii khun se sani laash thi
 Zakir immediately informed the police about this
 khabar lagate hi police maukey par ja pahunchi or drum se laash baraamad kar lee
 Which was cut with ruthlessness
 police ne maukey se ek gadasa bhi baraamad kiya, jo hatya main istemaal kiya gaya tha
 According to the police, the body was in a very bad condition after about 20 days had passed
 police ne panchnaame kii karrwai ke baad shav ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 The police registered the case after taking the statement of the landlord Zakir and now the accused Kinnar Chandni is being searched
 is hatyakand se puure ilaake main dehshat kaa maahaul he
 So far, no clue of the accused has been found by the police

 "in ghatnakramon kii taiyaari lambey samay se chal rahi thi
 In May 2001, the then Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf, in a press conference in Islamabad, said that the main motive behind allowing China to develop Gwadar Port was to counter India's nuclear submarines because of the slipping of the tongue 
 unhone kaha tha, "jab or jaise jarurat hogi, chini nausena kisi ko bhi makul jawaab dene ke liye guadar main rahegi

 priy viraat,team india kii test team ke nae captain viraat kohli, tumhaare kandhon par bahut badi jimmedaari aa gai he
 In the last Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy to be held in Sydney, the eyes of the cricket world will be dependent on your captaincy
 ham sabane edilade test main tumhaari test captaini kaa debyue dekha bhi or use saraahaa bhi
 As a captain, you also appeared fearless and you also saw leadership quality, but you still have a lot to learn
 ham sabko tumse bahut ummide hai lekin saath hi dar bhi he
 We were thrilled to see your aggressive captaincy in the first Test of the series, but in the subsequent two Tests, your aggression broke some limits, which we are also a little scared to see
 paanch aisi baaten jo viraat ko dhoni kii captaini se seekhni chahiesch kahuun to tumhaara yah atitude hamen thodaa khatarnaak lagata he, jo na sirf tumhaare liye balki puri team india ke liye musiibat ban saktaa he
 You have played only 32 Test matches but your batting has convinced us all
 pichley teen saalon main isi ballebaaji ke dam par tumhaari tulana cricket ke 'bhagwaan' kahe jane vaale master blaster sachin tendulkar se kii gai
 And to be honest, this comparison does not even look wrong
 lekin phir vahi ek baat tumhaara atitude hamen daraata he
 Being fearless is a good thing, but cricket is a game of gentlemen and it is the job of all cricketers to maintain its image
 australian daure par tumne jis tarah se press conference main jaakar yah kah diya ki mishael johnson kaa main sammaan nahin karata or wo sammaan diserv bhi nahin karata he, wo galat tha
 Such a statement of yours as a cricketer was not at all worthy
 australian khilaadiyon kii sledging kaa jawaab agar ham bhi usee bhashaa main dene lagenge to hamamen or unamem fark hi kya rah jayega? tum tendulkar ko apana guru bol chuke ho lekin tendulkar ne to aisa kabhi nahin kiya
 This kind of attitude will only harm you
 kisi bhi tej gendbaaj kii fabtiyon kaa jawaab dene ke liye tumhaara balla kaaphi he or tum uskaa bharpoor istemaal bhi kar rahe ho, lekin iske saath galat tarah ke bayaan dekar tum khud ke or team ke liye mushkilen khadi kar sakate ho
 Your style of showing anger and aggression has not been right from the beginning, but your batting forced us to ignore all this
 ipel match main gautam gambhir se maidan par ulajhna ho yaa sidney cricket ground par darshakon ko abhadra ishaara karnaa, hamen laga ki tumne in galatiyon se sabak liya he
 But on the Australian tour, we are seeing the same form of yours again
 aakraamakata agar positive ho to team ke liye sanjivani ban jaati he or agar yahi negative ho to jehar kaa kaam karti he
 It is now up to you whether you have to give life or poison to the team
 viraat tum ballebaaj ke taur par vaaki viraat ho chuke ho lekin captain ke taur par abhi lanbaa safar tay karnaa he tumko
 Make aggression your USP and return Team India to number one again, avoiding its excesses

 aarasi sharma ne kiya
 Highlighting the book, writer Ahmed said that Aurangzeb's character has been the subject of intense debate in Indian society for decades
 uski nitiyon ko lekar akasar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 As soon as the name of Aurangzeb comes, usually in our mind, there are such things as frenzied rulers, anti-hindu, cruel invaders, idol-temple bhankas, killers of brothers
 vah ek aisa badshaah bhi tha, jisane hindustan kii sarhadon ko nai manzilen deen
 During the rule for nearly 50 years, the Mughal Empire expanded from Afghanistan to South India

 It has the answer to every question that has been raised about Aurangzeb in the past years
 afasar ahamed kehete hai, beshak jawaab talashna aasaan nahin rahaa

 Officer Ahmed said on the occasion that the first section of 145 pages of the book is related to Aurangzeb's early life
 isamen uski vyaktigat jindagi se judi haroonges jaankariyaan hai, jo pehle kabhi saamne nahin ain
 For example, his knowledge of Sanskrit language, his unconsciousness at seeing a girl, his Hindu wives, the tales of his battlefield and the important correspondence between his father Shah Jahan before the power struggle, which brought to light the reality of the relationship between the two is

 On the questions related to the offer of talks to the Naxalites, the impact of the offer after Azad was killed and ending the Naxal violence, Chidambaram told reporters that there was no progress in the situation towards talks at present
 sthiti pehle jaisi hi he
 We would still like to repeat the offer that if the Naxalites leave the path of violence, the government is ready to talk to them

 In the conference of the state's Directors General of Police and the Inspector General of Police, the Home Minister regretted that the Maoists had not given any direct or credible reply on the offer of talks by the Central Government
 unhone kaha tha, ‘hamane bhakpa maovadiyon se hinsa chhodkar baatcheet karne ke liye aage aane ko kaha tha
 (but) i regret that no direct and reliable answer was received on our negotiation offer
 ’unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar naksali hinsa se nipatane ke liye vikaas or police karrwai kii do stareey ranneeti apnaane ke liye patibaddh he
 Asked if the talks would solve the Naxalite problem, Chidambaram said that he cannot claim that a solution will come out of the dialogue, but to find a solution, one has to negotiate first

 Despite winning the Cricket World Cup 2011 title, India are ranked third behind runners-up Sri Lanka (118) in this annual ranking
 isisi ne bayaan main kaha, ‘‘aisa isaliye he kyonki 2008-09 reating varsh main bharat ne 17 vanade jite the or keval paanch maichon main haar kaa saamana kiya tha, jo us samay kaa uskaa sarvshereshth ricard tha
 "he said," This year Australia won 11 odis and lost 11 odis, so Michael Clarke's team did not have to bear the brunt of the poor performance
 ’’iske anusaar, ‘‘pichley 12 maheenon main bharat ne nau vanade ganvaaye, jisamen antim do vanade aathvin ranking par kabiz westeindies team se haare the or ek isisi cricket vishwa cap ke group charan main ganvaaya tha, isaliye unka jeet-haar kaa anupaat vishwa cap ke final main pahunche srilanka or quarterfinal main pahunchane vaali austrailia or dakshin africa (116) kii team se kam he

 chini vaigyanikon ne ek aisa nayaa protein viksit karne kaa daawa kiya he jo ki cocaine kii lat ko chhudaane or lagane vaale ek ‘switch’ kii tarah kaam kar saktaa he
 Cocaine affects the brain by increasing dopamine levels
 dopamine mastishk sambandhi ek aisa transmeter he, jo ki mastishk ke kaamkaaj main mahatvapurn bhoomikaayen nibhaataa he
 These roles also include feeling of respect and enjoyment
 cocaine un proteinon par roak lagaati he, jo ki dopamine ko pun: avashoshit kar lete hai
 This causes dopamine to be produced and a person experiences pleasure at the 'highest' level
 chinis academy of sciensej ke tahat aane vaale shanghai institutes for biological sciensej ke ek dal ke pramukh shodhakarta jhou jiyavei ne kaha ki lat lagane ke dauraan dopamine transporter (dieti) naamak protein tantrika koshika main gati karte hue koshika kii sataha par aa jaataa he
 The comments jhou ke hawaale se sarkari akhbaar china daily ne kaha, hamane paaya ki mastishk main dieti kii sthiti hi pramukh antar paidaa karti he
 He said, "in the reverse situation, this transfer will not happen and in this way addiction can be stopped
" shodh dal kaa maananaa he ki lat par roak lagane kii kunjee viavi2 naamak chote se protein main chhipi he, jo ki dieti ke sthanantaran kaa niyaman karte hue ek aanvik switch kii tarah kaam karata he
 Scientists say the discovery of this role of VAV2 can be used in efforts to improve cocaine addicts
 duusare kism ke nashile padaarthon ke aadi logon ko sudhaarney ke liye alag upaay karne honge
 The research paper linked to this discovery was published on the website of the New York Journal Nature Neuroscience on July 7
 cocaine dopamine kaa str badhaakar mastishk ko prabhavit karti he
 Dopamine is a brain transmitter that plays important roles in brain functioning
 in bhoomikaaon main sammaan evam anand kii anubhuti bhi shaamil he
 Cocaine inhibits proteins that absorb dopamine again
 isse dopamine paidaa hota jaataa he or vyakti ko ‘ucchtam’str par anand kii anubhuti hoti he
 Lead researcher Zhou Jiawei, a team from the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that during addiction, a protein called dopamine transporter (DAT) moves to the cell surface, accelerating the nerve cell
 tippaniyan Quoting Zhou, the official newspaper China Daily said, "we found that the state of DAT in the brain makes the major difference
" unhone kaha, ulat sthiti main yah sthanantaran nahin hoga or is tarah se lat badhane par roak lagaai ja sakati he
 The research team believes that the key to stopping addiction is hidden in a small protein called VAV2, which acts like a molecular switch, regulating the transfer of DAT
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki viavi2 kii is bhoomika kii khoj kaa istemaal cocaine ke aadi logon ko sudhaarney ke prayaason main kiya ja saktaa he

 uttar pradesh ke kaddavar netaaon main shumaar mulaayam singh yadav ek baar phir mainpuri se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Mulayam's reputation is at stake in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, considered a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party, so the Bharatiya Janata Party would not like to let this former Chief Minister win the election easily
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye mainpuri se 12 ummidavaar maidan main hai, jahaan mukhya muqabla sapa se mulaayam singh yadav or bijepi ke prem singh shakya ke bich he
 Leaders of 8 regional parties and 2 independents are also posing their challenge
 2014 ke chunaav main 2 jagahon se jeet hasil karne ke baad mulaayam singh ne mainpuri seat chhod di thi or unhone azamgarh ko apana sansadeey kshetra chunaa
 In the subsequent by-elections, his grandson Tej Pratap Singh Yadav won the Lok Sabha by a big margin
 haalanki, mulaayam singh yadav isse pehle bhi kai baar yahaan se saansad rah chuke hai
 Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat has been in the news since the first general election held in the country
 1952 se lekar 1971 tak hue desh main kul 5 chunaav main congress ne jeet darj kii to 1977 main satta virdohi lahar main janata party ne jeet hasil kii
 But the next year, in the by-elections held in 1978, the Congress withdrew this seat
 uske baad 1980 main congress se seat chhini par 1984 kii lahar main phir waapas ai
 However, the Congress won its last time here in 1984, after which the seat remained in the possession of regional parties
 1989 or 1991 main yahaan lagaataar janata party ne jeet darj kii
 But after forming the party in 1992, Mulayam Singh Yadav contested the 1996 election from here and also won by a large margin
 uske baad 1998, 1999 main bhi ye seat samaajawaadee party ke paas hi rahi
 In 2004, 35 percent voters Yadav returned to this seat once again, but later left the seat
 2004 main dharmendra yadav yahaan se upachunaav main jite
 However, Mulayam returned here in the 2009 election and kept the seat with him
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi mulaayam ne phir se jeet hasil kii lekin baad main yah seat apane pote tejpratap singh yadav ko yah seat de di
 According to the 2014 general election data, there are more than 16 lakh voters in Mainpuri Lok Sabha
 jaateey sameekaran ko dekhen to is seat par yadav votaron kaa varchasv he, yahaan kareeb 35 fisadi matadaata yadav samudaay se hai
 While around 2

 These include Mainpuri, Bhogaon, Kishani, Karhal and Jaswantnagar
 bataa den ki jaswantnagar shivpal yadav kaa vidhansabha kshetra he
 Of these, only Bhogaon went to the Bharatiya Janata Party's account in the 2017 assembly elections, while the remaining 4 seats went to the sp's account
 2014 main nahin dikhaa modi lahar2014 ke chunaav main chali modi lahar kaa is seat par koi asar dekhne ko nahin mila tha or tatkaaleen samaajawaadee party ke pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne bade antar se jeet darj kii thi
 Tej Pratap Singh Yadav also won the election with a huge margin in the by-election held after he left the seat
 tejpratap singh yadav ko yahaan kareeb 65 fisadi vot mili, jabaki unke saamne khadey bijepi ke ummidavaar ko sirf 33 fisadi vot mili the
 The turnout was around 62 percent in the 2014 by-election

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday that amidst ongoing debate about actor Naseeruddin Shah's statement about intolerance in the country, there is no other country in the world as tolerant as India
 unhone uttar pradesh ko rajya hisson main baantne kii maang ko gairajaruri bataate hue kaha ki aabaadi boj nahin balki janasankhyikee labhaansh he
 Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the 114th Foundation Day celebrations of King George Medical University, Singh said on the question about actor Naseeruddin Shah's recent statement, "the tolerance i have in India, i think that finding in the world will not do 
 bharat duniya kaa aisa iklauta desh he jahaan vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharm paye jate hai
 That is, if people of all religions are living together, then it is India
 '' unhone kaha,‘‘main doharaana chaahunga ki islamic deshon main bhi islam ke sabhi 72 phirake ek saath nahin milte
 Only in India, all these fronts of Muslims exist, so there is no question of intolerance here
 '' gauratlab he ki mashhoor abhinayta nasiruddin shah ne haal main ek bayaan main kaha tha ki bharat main gaay kii jaan kii keemat aadmi kii jaan se zyada ho gayi he

 He said, "population should never be considered a burden

 No need to be unnecessarily upset
 '' singh ne is maukey par vibhinn kshetron main utkrisht yogadan karne vaali 24 hastiyon ko ‘uttar pradesh gaurav sammaan' se nawaja

 iske liye vah haal main hastakshar abhiyaan bhi chalaa chuki he
 Apart from this, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, an ally of the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh itself, is also demanding to divide Uttar Pradesh into four parts and in the coming Lok Sabha elections it will go public with the issue
