 Why should you tolerate everything? It is an idea that you either accept or not accept? Why should you tolerate this? unhone kaha, ashishnutaa isliye hai, kyonki aap ise sahan kar rahe hai

 Today 'education' is meant to be rich in literacy and informational information and the aim of today's education is to become a salaried officer-employee of a government, non-government office
 is arth main shiksha apane vaastavik swarup or uddeshy se bahut dur he or tathakthith shikshit utpann kar aadhi adhuri kshamtaaon vaale berozegaron kii bheed juta rahi he
 Targeting this incomplete and unsuccessful concept of modern education, the nationalist Maithilisharan Gupta had written in 'bharat Bharti', wishing for its destruction - Shiksha! You are destroyed, you become a job interest
 bharatvarsh main shiksha kaa yah bhraamak swarup britishkaal main astitv main aayaa
 The aim of the British was to create a new class of Indians through English education, which would help them in governing the customs and policies of the British state and establishing their governance by assisting them in governance
 shiksha ke madhyam se aatmgaurav, mulyachetana, vivek-bodh aadi aavashyak uddeshyon ko praapt karne kii na unhen aavashyaktaa thi or na unhone iske liye koi praytn kiya
 They wanted such horsemen as so-called educated youths to pull their empire-chariot, who would only accept the significance of life in their chakri, cut off from their cultural values for the sake of paddy-water and little facilities
 durbhaagya se swatantraaa prapti ke uparaant bhi shiksha kaa yahi chhadam hamaare desh main viksit hua he
 As a result, in the name of the educated, there is such a huge crowd of non-moral-valued facilitators, who are far from realizing their duty and venturing on violent movements for the attainment of rights
 ek pratishthit samachar patr main dinaank 1 sitambar, 2018 ko chhapi khabar ke anusaar jain samaaj ke lagbhag 422 tirthayatriyon kaa bada samooh jharkhand main sthit jainatirth sammed shikharji kii yatra ke liye 31agast,2018 ko praatah 6 baje 'indore haavda shipra express' se yatra karne ke liye ganjbasauda railway stesan par pahunchaa kintu tirthayatriyon kii pehle se arakshit siton par anaadhikrut rup se kabja jamaaye baithe bihar ke lagbhag paanch sau yuvakon ne, jo indore se railway kii pariksha dekar waapas laut rahe the, tirthayatriyon ko yatra nahin karne di
 By undesirable activities like quarrel, stone pelting, chainpulling, they deprived the citizens of their justified right to travel as per rules and for their convenience went to the level of crime and raised serious questions on today's education system
 bheed main badalakar yuva-shakti kaa durupyog karti yah kisi shikshit peedi he, jisamen na apane uttardaayitv kaa bhaan he; na apane kartavya kaa gyaan he ; na apane desh ke kanoon or nagarikon ke sammaan kii bhaavana he
 What golden future can we expect from such a so-called educated generation? Youths may have their own problems, but they cannot be resolved to take away the rights of other citizens
 aisi anuttaradaayitv purna maansikta kii uddand peedi naukari paakar kya janaseva karegi ? yah ek bada prashn he! is prakaar kii yada-kada ghatane bali durghatnaayen is tathy kii sakshi hai ki hamaari vartmaan shiksha-vyavastha achche or anushaasit naagarik banane main asafal ho rahi he
 It is not fair to blame only youths for such accidents that happen on a day to day basis
 iske liye shiksha-vyavastha, shikshak, samaaj or vifal hoti kanoon vyavastha bhi uttaradaayi he
 We are failing to teach discipline to our children
 mata-pita, parijanon or shikshakon kii anuttaradaayitv purna manamaniyaan nai peedi ko sanskaarit karne main asamarth siddh ho rahi hai or shiksha kaa uddeshy peeche chhot rahaa he
 The number of educational institutions is increasing continuously, but the standard of education is falling
 paathya-saamagree main maanviya mulyon kii upeksha, shikshan-sansthaanon main sansadhano kii anuplabdhta, shikshakon main daayitv-nishtha or shikshankaushal kii kami, shiksha-kshetra main raajnneeti kaa anaavashyak hastkshep aadi anek kaaran iske liye uttaradaayi hai 
 Education is not just literacy or informative prosperity
 vah manushya ko manushya banane kii kala he; maanviya-mulyon kii pushti kaa prabhavi upadan he; vivek ko viksit karne kaa madhyam he; adhikaron ke prati jaagrukta ke saath kartavyon ke prati nishtha or samarpan kaa bodh he
 The first and last goal of education is a well-designed civic work dedicated to the country and society
 iske liye shiksha kshetra main bade parivartan kii aavashyaktaa he
 Although there were many experiments for change in the field of education after independence; Commissions were made; The call for change in education policies was also given, but the form of education remained almost the same
 do tihaai asafalataa ke babajood ek tihaai safalataa ke aadhaar par shikshaarthi agle str par bheje jate rahe
 Realizing only paper certificates as the standard of merit did not make the examination of actual merit possible and in every field, under-skilled and underprivileged people were distinguished, which hindered the path of public service
 vyaavhaarik str par praaanpatron or oopaadhiyon se adhik yogyata or gunvattta kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki vyavhaarik kshetra main kagaji abhilekh nahin, karm kii kushalta apekshit hoti he
 Without giving proper direction to youth power, we cannot build a strong, prosperous and safe India, and the development of education cannot be done without the development of a generation of character-disciplined youths on the proper path according to the expectations of the ages
 shiksha jagat main hone vaale sakaaratmak bhavi parivartanon se hi desh kaa apekshit vikaas sambhav he
 Therefore, serious thought and efforts are required in this direction

 Q
 main vibhaagadhyaksh-hindi hai*** The last day of Paush month is of full moon day and there is a possibility of Mahasanan on this day
 pus poornima par duniya bhar main log pavitra nadiyon main snaan karte hai
 The month of Pausha is considered to be of the Sun God and the full moon date is the moon date
 surya or chandramaa kaa aisa adbhut sanyog pus poornima ko hi miltaa he
 On this day, all the wishes can be fulfilled by worshiping the Sun and the Moon
 poornima yani purno maa:
 The meaning of the month is lunar
 arthath jis din chandramaa kaa aakaar purna hota he us din ko poornima kaha jaataa he
 There is definitely a festival on the full moon of every month
 lekin pus or magh maah kii poornima kaa atyadhik mahatv mana gaya he, visheshkar uttar bharat main hinduon ke liye yah bahut hi khaas din hota he
 In 2018, Paush Purnimavarsh 2018, although the full moon date starts from January 01, but the sunrise has already occurred at the time when the date begins
 isaliye vidwaan ke matanusaar pus poornima agle din suryoday se maani jaayegi
 Thus in 2018 Paush Purnima is on 2 January, Tuesday
 pavitra maah magh kaa swaagat karne vaali is mokshadayini poornima par prabhu bhakthi va snaan dhyaan, danadi se punya kamaayen
 Importance of Paush Purnima The full moon of Pausha month is considered very auspicious for those who wish for salvation
 kyonki iske baad magh maheene kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The bathing in the month of Magh also starts with Paush Purnima
 manyata he ki jo vyakti is din vidhipurvak praat:kaal snaan karata he vah moksh kaa adhikari hota he
 He gets rid of the cycle of birth and death, that is, he gets liberated
 chunki magh maah ko bahut hi shubh va iske prayek din ko mangalakaari mana jaataa he isliye is din jo bhi kaary aarambh kiya jaataa he use faldaayi mana jaataa he
 It is also important to donate according to the capacity after bathing on this day
 pus poornima se hi magh snaan shuru ho jate hai
 Bathing in the rivers Punyatoya in Magh month is said to have special significance
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki mrityulok main jinhen swargaprapti kii ichha he, unhen magh ke puure maheene main nadiyon main snaan karnaa chahie
 Paush Purnima Tithi and Muhurt Purnima Tithi Start - 11:44 am (01 Jan 2018) Purnima Dates End - 7:53 pm (02 Jan 2018) So, Asaram is a child rapist

 Shahabuddin's wife Hina Shahab has attacked Bihar government chief Nitish Kumar and said that 'nitish Kumar is taking revenge for supporting Lalu Prasad
 'shahabuddin kii patni hina shahaab kaa aarope he ki 2005 main jab saat din ke lienithish kumaaraki sarkaar bihar main bani thi to us vakt shahabuddin ne lalu prasad kaa saath diya tha, nitish kumaar usee din kaa badla aaj vasuul kar rahe hai
 This is the reason that the Bihar government canceled the bail granted by the Patna High Court in the Supreme Court
 bel milane par jail se baahar aane orbel raddahone par jail jane ke samay tak shahabuddin kaa rukh nitish kumaar par hamalavar tha
 Now that Shahabuddin is behind bars in jail, his wife Hina Shahab has continued to attack Chief Minister Nitish
 hina shahaab ne kaha ki shahabuddin ke jail se baahar aane par nitish kumaar ko laga ki bihar main bhay kaa maahaul kaayam ho gaya he lekin kya unke jail jane ke baad se bihar main ab aman, shanti or bhaichaare kaa maahaul kaayam hua
 Hina Shahab accused the district administration of Siwan that under the pressure of the government, the district administration used to make a false report about Siwan's law and order, whereas there was no such thing in Siwan
 agar siwan main kanoon-vyavastha kharaab hoti to itane zyada sankhya main log siwan kaise pahunch pate

 Votes will be cast for the new government in Delhi on February 7 and i will not vote for Aam Aadmi Party or Airwind Kejriwal this time
 unhen vot nahin dene ke liye mere paas kai kaaran hai, jinamein se 10 ye hai
 1
 vivaadon ke 49 diphpane 49 din ke kaarykaal main arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar vivaadon main ghiri rahi
 He made some useful decisions, but the lack of a natural instinct while running the government was shown in his tenure
 unhone janata darbar bulaayaa, wo flop ho gaya
 He had to stop the media entry in the secretariat
 phir mukhyamantri rahete hue unka dharne par baithna bhi kai logon ko raas nahin aayaa
 i will vote for Ajay Maken, because
 
 
 2
 Why not choose a veteran? Arvind Kejriwal's low political experience is also a reason
 unhen raajnneeti main aae abhi do saal se thodaa hi zyada vakt hua he
 In that too, the experience of running the government is just 49 days
 aise main ham apana pradesh chalaane ke liye koi anbhavi pratinidhi kyon na chune
 i will vote for Kiran Bedi, because
 
 
 3
 Accuse the politicabil-e-compliment that Kejriwal's movement was basically against corruption
 lekin kai baar unki muhim sirf ek press conference or aarope lagane tak hi simit kyon rah jaati he
 4
 vichaardhaara kya he?aam aadmi party kii raajnneetik vichaardhaara ko lekar kaaryakartaaon or logon main bhi spashtataa kaa abhaav he
 His slogans include 'bharat Mata ki Jai' and 'inquilab Zindabad', but his attitude seems neither nationalist nor leftist
 aise main nitiyon ko lekar ek aspashtataa bani hui he
 5
 party par kiskaa kabja?kya kaaran he ki AAP se alag hue zyaadaatar netaa party main andruni loktantr kaa abhaav bataate hai? aisa lagata he ki party par arvind kejariwal kaa ekadhikaar he
 However, in BJP and Congress too only a select number of people walk
 lekin AAP to hameshaa bijepi-congress se alag naitik maanakon par chalane kaa daawa karti rahi he
 Did AAP get the same disease? i will vote for Kejriwal, because
 
 
 6
 The unexpected opportunity that came after 49 days is an unexpected resignation
 kejariwal lakh maafee maang len, aap lakh koshish karen is tathy ko bhulane kii, lekin yah galati ab bhi aam aadmi party ke gale kii haddi bani hui he
 His credibility to remain in government is still under question
 raajnneeti main ganvaae hue maukey baar-baar nahin milte or arvind ek jaruri mauka kho chuke hai
 i will not vote for Ajay Maken, because
 
 
 7
 The Aam Aadmi Party's opinion on financial issues in favor of which economic policy has not yet been revealed
 masalan, unki aarthik niti nav-udaaravaadi he yaa samaajawaadee? usne kiraanaa kshetra main epadiai kaa virodh to kiya, lekin kya vah puri tarah epadiai kii avadharana ke khilaaf he? nivesh ke mudde par vah kis paale main khadi he?8
 Will be able to create new jobs? Many youth say that Arvind Kejriwal's intentions are clear, but there is doubt about his abilities
 masalan agar vah satta main aae to kis tarah nai naukariyaan or avasar paidaa karenge? kar bhi paaenge yaa nahin?main kiran bedi ko vot nahin duungaa, kyonki

 It also means that if i want to meet Kejriwal, then there should be 20 thousand rupees in my pocket

 kai mahilaon ko swaabhaavik rup se garbhadhaaran karne main mushkil aati he
 Even after many test reports are normal they are unable to conceive naturally
 purushon main 'infertility' un pramukh karkon main se ek he
 The quality and quantity of sperm in men play an important role in conceiving and is also a deciding factor in male reproductive capacity
 yadi skhlit shukranu kam hon yaa kharaab gunvattta ke ho to garbhadhaaran karne kii sambhaavnaaen 10 guna kam or kabhi-kabhi isse bhi kam ho jaati he
 IVF Expert Dr Indira IVF Hospital, Delhi
 sagarika agarwal kaa kahana he, mail factorinfertilitasaamanya yaa kharaab shukranu ke utpaadan ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Males may be prone to have no problems with their sperm production and development, but nevertheless sperm structure and ejaculation problems prevent healthy sperm from reaching the ejaculatory fluid and ultimately the sperm cannot reach the fallopian tube
 Where fertilization can occur
 shukranu kii kam sankhya shukranu vitaran kii samasya kaa suchak ho sakate hai
 He said that infertility symptoms are not predominant in men and there are no symptoms
 yahaan tak ki skhlit veery kii gunvattta or isaki upasthiti nagn ankhon se dekhne par saamaanya lagati he
 The quality of spermatozoa can only be examined through medical testing to determine the possible cause of infertility
 dow
 Sagarika pointed out that there may be three (or more) primary factors for mail infertility
 oligozospermia (shukranuon kii kam sankhya), terratozospermia (shukranuon kii asaamaanya ruparekha) or sperm transport disorder
 Sperm transport disorders are responsible for about 20 percent of mail factor infertility
 unhone bataaya ki sperm transport disorder ke kaaran zyaadaatar purushon main shukranu ke ekaagratha main kami aa jaati he or shukranu mahila kii kokh tak surakshit rup se pahunchane main aksham hota he
 According to the survey conducted between 2015-2017, it was observed that among the couples wishing to undergo IVF procedure, 40 percent of the underlying reasons were in the male partner
 prayek paanch purushon main se ek purush main sperm transport kii samasya thi
 The survey also included men who had undergone vasectomy, but now wanted to have children
 unhone kaha ki tantrika tantra se sambandhit kuch vikaar bhi shukranuon kii gatishiltaa ko baadhit kar sakate hai
 Conditions such as nerve damage, such as injury to the spinal cord (affecting the movement of muscles) due to accidents or surgery, can also adversely affect the ability of the ducts to transport sperm
 aisa paaya gaya he ki avsaad rodhi davaaiyaan bhi tantrika tantra ko prabhavit karti hai
 Dr
 sagarika ke anusaar, testicular sperm ritreval aspireshan kritrim takneekon main sabase nayi or sabase viksit takanic he
 It is not only revolutionizing the field of ICSI and IVF, but has also shown that sperm maturation and passage through epididymis are not mandatory for egg fertilization
 jinhone kaha ki yah takanic epididmis main avrodh vaale marijon ke liye bhi behad phydemand he, avrodh chaahe vesectomi jaisi purv main kii gai surgery, sankraman yaa kisi bhi janmajaat kaarnon se ho

 tamaam utaar chadhaav ke baad aaj ye donon sitare aadhikarik taur par kisi ko date nahin kar rahe hai
 The US judge has rejected Devyani Khobragade's request to extend the date for the preliminary hearing
 devayani maamle main 13 janvari ko abhiyog lagaaya janaa he
 Southern District of New York magistrate Sarah Netburn said that by extending the date, she (khobragade) would not get the relief she needs to negotiate between herself and the government to resolve the visa fraud case
 jaj ne apane aadesh main kaha ki prativaadee kii giraftaar yaa is tarah ke aaropon ke silsile main samman milane kii taarikh se 30 dinon ke bheetar prativaadee ke khilaaf aparaadh ko anjaam dene ke liye abhiyog yaa soochna daayar ho jaani chahie
 The postponement of the date of preliminary hearing will have no effect on the filing of the indictment
 netberne ne kaha, prativaadee ne sirf yah aagrah kiya he ki kisi achche kaaran ke liye praarambhik sunwaayee 30 dinon ke liye sthagit kar di jaae
 Changing the date of the hearing will not change the time for filing an indictment or information, concerns over the pressures of an impending indictment on defendant's plea negotiations will not provide her with the relief she seeks
 unhone apane aadesh main kaha, uchit vajah nahin bataai gai or isliye prativaadee kaa anurodh naamanzoor kiya jaataa he
 Netburn said that Khobragade, who was arrested on December 12, 2013, should be charged with indictment (or by the government filing an information against him) by January 2014

 On October 28, this terrorist resorted to his girlfriend Saeeda for the murder of the cid's Jambaz Sub Inspector in Pulwama, Kashmir
 sab inspector imtiyaaj ko usne pehle hani trep main fansaaya
 Saeeda befriended the Sub Inspector by increasing his close proximity

 On the same day, the Sub Inspector was going to his house in Pulwama

 According to the fixed plan, Saeed Saika called Imtiaz and told that he too had to go to Pulwama
 aatankiyon se mili dhamkiyon ke baad bhi mir ne apni dost ko car main baitha liya
 The moment-by-moment location sent to the terrorists was not even aware that the girl sitting with him was the girlfriend of the terrorist Ansar and that he was part of the dreaded plot of murder
 aatanki kii wo garlfriend mir se judi pal-pal kii jaankaree vaaya ansaar ul raja hijbul aatankiyon tak pahunchaati rahi
 In the murder plot, the girlfriend played the guide of the terrorists and the terrorists succeeded in their cause

 Inspired by the whatsapp group, Ansar killed the sub-inspector
 sab inspector ko pehle dhamkee bhi di gai thi
 The sub-inspector's father was also in the police
 sab inspector ko aatankwaadiyon ke bare main sateek jaankaree milti thi
 Therefore, they remained the eyes of the terrorists

 There is not even a good Grand Prix event in India

 mangal kii sataha par khaaraa jal kuch khaas paristhitiyon main maujuud ho saktaa he lekin yah jivan ke liye sahyog nahin karegaa
 These are indicated by data collected from the red planet by nasa's Curiosity Rover

 Vincent Chevrier, assistant professor at the University of Arkansas' Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, said that under certain circumstances, a few hours per day, you may have the right conditions to create liquid saline water on the surface of Mars
 khaare jal kii maujuudagi mars orbitor dwaara kiye gaye sthiti ke avlokan kaa byoraa de sakati he, jise dhalaan par gahari rekhaaen kaha jaataa he or yah grah ke garm mausam ke dauraan badhata he
 However, Chevrier believes that the circumstances on Mars are difficult enough to support in life
 unhone kaha, 'yadi ham khaaraa jal banane ke thermodynomics ke avlokan ko or bhu-kshetreey jeevon ko jod kar dekhen to kya mangal ke khaare jal main jeevon ke liye ek sambhaavna talashna mumkin he
 'mars is cold, extremely dry and has 200 times lower atmospheric pressure than Earth on this planet
 isaki sataha par shuddh jal yaa to jam saktaa he yaa minuton main ubal saktaa he
 However, in 2008, nasa's Phoenix lander identified perchlorate salt in polar soil samples
 perchloret prithvi par durlabh he lekin ye vayumandal se nami sokhne ke liye or jal ke jamaav ke taapmaana ko kam karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The widespread presence of percolate makes liquid water possible on Mars
 tippaniyan Curiosity Rover has confirmed the presence of perchlorate in equatorial soils

 Researchers have said that it is likely that there was a possibility of life on ancient Mars

 The result is based on nearly two years of weather data that was collected from a pit near the equatorial region of the planet

 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party President Chandrababu Naidu was speculating that he might go with the Congress ever since he split from the NDA
 lekin unke iraade kuch or bhi the, congress ko to unhone saath liya hi duusare vipakshi dalon ko bhi ekajute karne main lage hai
 Political critics believe that Naidu had already realized that if a strong alternative is to emerge against Modi, then a different course has to be chosen
 nitish kumaar ek majboot vikalp ho sakate the, lekin philhal wo endie main hai agar nitish baahar hote to shaayad naidu se zyada tavajjo unhen milti
 It is also being said that the real target of Naidu is Andhra Pradesh, where assembly elections are to be held along with Lok Sabha in 2019
 rahul gandhi ko sabhi dal netaa maan len yah daawey ke saath nahin kaha ja saktaa, mayawati akhilesh ke saath chunaav ladane ko taiyaar hai, lekin congress ke saath sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan ho paaegaa yaa nahin yah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 If the Congress does not get the respectable seats, then there is also doubt whether it will go to the polls with both
 aise main chandrababu naidu ek vikalp bananaa chaahate hai
 Elections are going to be held in Telangana, there is talk of an alliance with TDP and Congress, although Congress has already said here that it will contest 95 seats
 rahul se baat karne kaa ek makasad yah bhi ho saktaa he ki vah telugana main zyada pratinidhitiv chaahate hon
 Elections to the Telangana Legislative Assembly with 119 seats were held in 2014 in which TRS got 62 seats, Congress 24, TDP-BJP 22 and others 11 seats
 kahin andhra kaa chunavi ganit to nahin asli vajahasamikshakon kaa maananaa he ki tidipi kaa congress ke saath aana or bhaajapa se dur jane kaa asli makasad he andhra kaa chunavi ganit
 Chandrababu Naidu feels that being with the BJP, Muslim voters are far from him
 andhra pradesh main muslimon kii aabaadi takreeban 9 fisadi he
 There are a total of 176 seats in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly
 In the last election, BJP and TDP contested together
 isamen tidipi ko 103 or bhaajapa ko 4 siten mil pai thim
 Yuvjan Shramik Rayathu Congress Party (YSRCP) had 65 seats
 tidipi ko lagata he ki agar bhaajapa saath main na hoti to bhi unki sarkaar aaraam se ban jaati
 Being with the BJP does not allow them to get approval in other states
 agar unhen majboot vikalp bananaa he to apana rasta tay karnaa hoga
 Will the advantage of going against the BJP benefit Naidu, who was also in the NDA government of Bajpai, but later they separated
 modi ke saath bhi unhone chunaav ladaa lekin phir alag ho gaye
 In this way he also has to prove that he is really away from the BJP and is really trying to prevent him from forming the next government
 yah dharna jitani majubat hogi muslim matadaata unke paksh main aayega or unhen phayda hoga
 Naidu met Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday and both pledged to defeat the BJP
 iske baad vah rankapa ke sharad pavaar, neshnal conference ke farukh abdulla, sipiai (em) ke seetaram yechuri, sapa ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav se mili
 Prior to this, he has also met BSP supremo Mayawati

 But it is not so easy to take everyone along
 uttar pradesh jahaan loksabhaa kii sabase zyada siten hai sapa-basapa or congress ke bich baat final nahin ho pai he
 Mamata Banerjee also cannot be said whether she will be willing to join hands with the Congress or not
 naidu sipiai (em) ke seetaram yechuri se mili yah bhi mamata banerjee ko sweekaar hoga yaa nahin
 Nevertheless, after the meeting with Naidu, the kind of response given by the leaders has shown the hope of uniting the non-bjp parties
 yah dekhnaa hoga ki is mulaakaat koi thos rup nikalakar aata he yaa nahin

 During the promotion of Dedh Ishqiya, directed by Abhishek Chaubey, to be released on January 10, the duo took some time to talk in detail about modern woman and intimacy on the screen of India Today correspondent Asmita Bakhshi
 jab aap pehali baar milin to ek duusare ke bare main kya sochati thim?maadhuri: maine gangs of vasepur dekhi to mujhe laga, 'yah to acchhee he
 Who is this actress? ' Huma was then signed for acting in one and a half Ishqiya
 ham shemaru studio main script dekhne pahunche
 She was in a platoon and in a very simple way
 ve meri ore dekh rahi thim or nazren takaraane kaa intjaar kar rahi thim
 Huma: i could not believe that these are Madhuri Dixit! Madhuri: But when the shooting started, i was very impressed by them
 mujhe ye tej or sundar lageen
 Huma: i don't know what to say about ma'am that hasn't been said before
 ve vaaki mukammal adaakara hai
 Now i also know that they are better people too
 itani lokapriyata ke baavjood unki vinamrata mere dil ko chhu gai
 What was the conversation between the two of you on the set and how was the bowling? Madhuri: We are together in crime in the film
 ham set par khusur-phusur karti thim or har koi asurakshit ho jaataa tha
 We ranged from her father's restaurant
 
 
 
 Used to talk about everything
 huma: (maadhuri se) aapke bachche kis tarah se dhamal karte hai
 
 
 Madhuri: They are very naughty
 ham film nirmaan ke bare main bhi baaten karte the, pehle kaise hua karata tha or ab kya najaara he
 Much has changed nowadays
 ham log mere un geeton ke bare main bhi baaten karte the jo inhen (huma ko) pasand hai
 Huma: It is very easy to work with them

 i was trying to be normal

 This is what i want to learn from them
 aap 1990 ke dashak ke cinema or aaj ke daur main kya bada fark dekhati hai?maadhuri: ab aisi koi seemaa rekha nahin rah gai he ki yah commercial film he or yah art film
 i remember when i was sentenced to death there was a lot of uproar
 log puch rahe the ki main art film kyon kar rahi hum or tab main kahati thi ki 'aisa kya ho gaya, yah bhi film hi he
 'I am glad that now these things have become of old times
 ab, bas yahi rah gaya he ki yah acchhee film he or yah acchhee nahin he
 Actually the film is a film, why should it be divided into blueprints? You agree that there is a whole newness in female characters over the years? Madhuri: i think now the female characters are not just victims or revenge 
 ve saamaanya insaan hai
 Really it gives a feeling of freshness
 huma: ve gudinga nahin hai
 Earlier films on women used to be about crying or washing up
 khushnuma kahaniyaan nahin hoti thim
 They were not stories of strong women
 vah gruhinee yaa begum ho sakati thi, ab vah kuch bhi ho sakati he
 Close to real life
 aaj aap sauteli maa hai to jaruri nahin ki buree hi hon
 When i used to watch movies, the woman was either very beautiful or immersed in a trough of despair and despair
 aaj aapke paas vikalp simit nahin hai
 This is a sign of good times
 aap aaj kii heroinon or 20 saal pehle kii pramukh abhinetriyon main kya fark dekhati hai?huma (muskaarate hue): aaj bhi unke liye khubasurat hona jaruri he
 Madhuri: Earlier dance was very important
 aapako har maamle main mukammal hona padataa tha
 Today you can say, 'I don't like dance', yet can be successful
 aapako sirf acchhee acting aani chahie
 Huma is very good
 ve aaj kii khantee ladki hai
 You can learn to dance and i am sure that she will do films in which there are complete heroines of Hindi films
 huma: haa, main koshish karuungi ki meri agali film dance movie ho
 Madhuri: You should
 yah jaruri bhi he
 What benefit did Huma get and how did you help each other for the film? Madhuri: They worked to create ease and enthusiasm to take things forward
 unka muniya kaa kirdaar kaaphi jatil he
 You cannot guess what she is going to do
 unhone kairactor main rahasy ke tach ko bakhubi piroyaa he
 There was no such thing as who would do the lead scene or who would win the game because at that time the characters would become ineffective
 huma: ham ek-duusare kaa dhyaan rakhte the ki koun kya kah rahaa he
 In this way a friendly relationship was formed between us
 aaj filmon main antarangta alag dhang se dikhaai ja rahi he
 It is very close to real life, it is not like the symbolic songs of the 1990s
 kya yahaan tak aane main lanbaa vakt laga he?maadhuri: darshak bhi nae daur ke hai
 Today society has opened up more than before
 ab multiplex hai or aap jis darshak varg ko chahen, uske liye film bana sakate hai
 That is, a film can be for children, then for the whole family or for adults
 huma: parade par antarangta dikhaanaa thodaa pechida maamla he
 If you can make it beautiful then it is better otherwise it may not look good
 main khaskar asahaj mahasoos karti hum kyonki aapako dusron par kuch zyada hi bharosa karnaa padataa he
 There are many scenes of intimacy in this film but it is not that after ten years i have to hesitate to see them or tell my grandchildren not to watch the film

 kendriya jail main duty par tainaat 54 varshiya up jailer kii shuukravaar ko kathith taur par dil kaa daura padane se maut ho gayi
 a top jail department official said that Manikchandra Bhavore (54) allegedly suffered a heart attack in his office in the central jail
 unhen fouran shaskeey maharaja yashwantrao chikitsaalay le jaaya gaya
 He said that after being examined in the hospital, the doctors declared Bhavor dead
 jail adhikari ne bataaya ki police ko bhavor kii maut kii aupchaarik soochna de di gayi he
 Meanwhile, an official of MG Road Police Station told that a postmortem of the body of the Deputy Jailor will be done
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 An elderly couple suddenly disappear in Delhi
 ghar kii iklauti beti unhen har jagah dhundti he
 But even after all the efforts, when there is no clue of both of them, after a few days, she goes to the police and writes a report of her parents' disappearance
 par phir bhi donon kaa koi pataa nahin chalata
 Many more days pass
 phir tabhi ek rose ek naale main ek suutakes tairta hua nazar aata he
 People report to the police
 police suutakes kholti he
 Mother was locked in a suitcase
 iske baad usee naale se ek doosraa suutakes miltaa he
 The father was locked in another suitcase
 wo ladki bephikr apane bwoyfriend or police ke saath saath gum rahi thi
 Was looking for the murderer of her parents
 lekin uski hakeekat jaan lijie
 She herself was a murderer of her parents
 ek aisi kaatil, jo pehle maa-baap kaa katl karti he
 Then the corpse breaks the limbs
 iske baad laash ko suutakes main rakhti he or phir suutakes naale main le jaakar phenk detii he
 When Aaj Tak reporter asked the murdered daughter why she did so, she says that there were some personal issues
 jaananaa nahin chahenge ki apane maa-baap se inke personal ishyu kya the
 so listen
 ye shaadishuda thi
 Not married to husband because of having a boyfriend
 sasuraal chhod diya
 She started living with parents
 phir nazar maa-baap ke makaan par gad gai
 He did not bow down to their insistence
 lihaaza isane baari baari se un donon ko maar daalaa
 Reporter- Was there a personal issue
 sonia- family problem thi sar
 Reporter- Was there a family problem
 sonia- mere paas iskaa ansar nahin he koi bhi
 Now let's know
 
 What was the family problem that even after killing the parents, it is not able to tell
 
 So listen, this story of its sins starts from the 8th of this month
 dilli ke nangaloi ilaake main behate is naale main 8 march kii shaam ko logon kii nazar ek ajeeb si chiz par padi
 It was a large suitcase of Mahroon color, which was closed but half out of the drain
 naale main itnaa bada suutakes padaa dekh kar vahaan se guzar rahe kisi musfir ko is par shaq hua or usne police ko ittila di
 Immediately the Delhi Police was on the scene and they took out the suitcase with the help of sweepers
 lekin police kii hairaani kaa tab koi thikaana nahin rahaa, jab is baari-bharkam suutakes ko kholane par usamen ek bujurg mahila kii laash mili
 It was clear from the way the corpse was broken inside the suitcase by breaking his hands and feet, that the killers must have given their victims a painful death
 baharhaal, police ne laash kii shinaakht karne kii shuruyaat kii or kuch hi ghanton kii mashkkat ke baad police ko isamen kamyaabi bhi mil gai
 Because the woman who had gone missing, her daughter Sonia had written the report of her mother's disappearance at Paschim Vihar police station on March 4, just four days before the body was found
 wo mahila thi jaagir cor
 Sonia, along with her mother Jagir Kaur, had also written the missing report of her father Gurmeet Singh at the police station
 aise main ab police ko lag rahaa tha kii kahin qaatilon ne jaagir cor kii tarah gurmeet singh kii jaan bhi naa le lee ho? police ko ye bhi lag rahaa tha ki kahin gurmeet singh hi to apni bivi kaa katl kar kahin faraar nahin ho gaya
 But the police wanted to be satisfied before reaching any conclusion
 or isi koshish main police ne nangaloi ke is naale main jaagir cor kii laash milane ke baad bhi apana talaashi abhiyaan jari rakhaa
 The first suspicion of the police turned out to be correct
 kai ghante kii kadi mashkkat ke baad police ko is naale se ek doosraa suutakes mila
 This suitcase was also as heavy as the first suitcase
 ab bagair der kiye police ne doosraa suutakes khulwaaya or sitam dekhie ki is suutakes se jaagir cor ke bujurg pati gurmeet singh baahar nikle
 But the dead
 ab sabase bada sawaal yahi tha ki akhir donon bujurgon kii jaan kisne lee or kyon? akhir inase kisi kii kya dushmani thi? kya qatl lutpaat kii vajah se hua yaa phir kisi ranjish ke chalate? sawaal kai the or police ko inhen sawaalon ke jawaab dhund kar qaatil tak pahunchnaa tha
 Now the police started investigating the case
 use ek saath kai angel par kaam karnaa tha, lekin pehla suraag bhi parivaar se hi milane kii ummid thi
 In this effort, the police first started questioning the elderly Jagir Kaur and her daughter Sonia, living with Gurmeet Singh
 sonia ne donon kii gumshudagi kii report pashchim vihaar thane main 4 march ko darj karwaai thi, jabaki padosiyon or rishtedaaron se poochtacha karne par pataa chalaa ki donon usase kai rose pehle se hi najar nahin aa rahe the
 In such a situation, the police first suspected their daughter Sonia
 uske paas is sawaal kaa koi pukhta jawaab nahin tha ki akhir usne gumshudagi kii report likhavane main itani deree kyon kii? jabaki uske duusare rishtedaar bataa rahe the ki jaagir cor or gurmeet singh ko aakiri baar 20-21 farvari ke aas-paas dekha gaya tha
 Now the police started tightening their grip on Sonia
 police ne sonia se kai sawaal puche
 Sonia answered those questions, but intermittently
 
 
 atak-atak kar
 
 
 And even where Sonia was telling her presence these days, her mobile phone's location was not matching with her
 yani sonia apane vahaan hone or nahin hone ko lekar bhi jhooth bol rahi thi
 Meanwhile, the police noticed another strange coincidence
 police ne dekha ki sonia kaa bwoyfriend prince or uske do dost 21 farvari or 2 march ke rose uske ghar aae the or inhen do dinon main jaagir cor or gurmeet singh aakiri baar zindaa dekhe gaye the
 Gurmeet Singh was not known since February 21, while Jagir Kaur, who went to Punjab, returned to Delhi on March 1 and mysteriously disappeared on March 2
 aise main ye sawaal lazimi tha ki akhir sonia ke bwoyfriend prince kii uske ghar maujuudagi se donon bujurgon ke gaayab hone kaa aisa kya rishta tha? to police ne jab is sawaal ke saath sonia kaa saamana kiya, to sonia ek baar phir ladkadaane lagi
 And finally he had to admit that he is the one who along with his boyfriend and his companions killed his elderly parents
 sonia kaa ye khulaasa kisi ko bhi dahalane ke liye kaafii tha
 That is because after all how can a real daughter take the life of her own parents in such a brutal way? And why? So the police now had to know the answers to these questions
 lihaaza ab police puch rahi thi or sonia bataa rahi thi
 Sonia said that her father Gurmeet Singh was alone at home after her mother Jagir Kaur moved to Punjab for some work
 wo apane pita se chhutkaaraa paanaa chaahati thi
 Seeing the opportunity on 21 February, he put intoxicating pills in his father's tea
 chaay pite hi wo behosh ho gaye
 Since the plot of death was already ready
 ishaara milte hi uskaa bwoyfriend prince apane do saathiyon ke saath unke ghar pahunchaa or sabane behoshee main hi gurmeet singh kaa galaa ghont kar laash suutakes main bhari or use naale main nipta diya
 But just half the work was done
 kyonki gurmeet singh kii bivi jaagir cor abhi zindaa thi
 Elder Gurmeet Singh was killed
 laash bhi nipataai ja chuki thi
 a week's time has passed, and no one has even heard the ears
 aise main sonia, uske bwoyfriend prince or baaki qaatilon kaa hausala saatven aasmaan par tha
 He started to think that now he will also hide his mother Jagir Kaur and no one will know
 kaafii had tak aisa hua bhi
 Jagir Kaur returned from Punjab on 1 March
 or agle hi din yani 2 march ko sonia ne apni maa ko behoshee kii dawa mila kar chaay pilaai
 Then he fainted and strangled him with the help of his boyfriend and his companions
 qaatilon ne thik gurmeet singh kii tarah hi unki laash bhi ek suutakes main bhari or use nangaloi ke naale main main phenk aae
 Now the work was done
 das din ke andar maa-baap ko thikaane laga kar sonia raahat mahasoos kar rahi thi
 But there were many mistakes made by murderers here
 pehali galati to yahi hui ki wo gurmeet singh kii laash kii tarah jaagir cor kii laash gahare pani main phenkna bhul gaye or wo suutakes dur se nazar aa rahi thi
 Seeing the suitcase, someone gave the news to the police
 duusari galati ye hui ki sonia ne apane maa-baap kii gumshudagi kii report likhavane main der kar di
 Sonia's first suspicion was found when Jagir Kaur was found dead
 iske baad tafteesh kii raushnee main baaki ke jhooth to dhire-dhire benaqaab ho hi gaye
 Sonia told the police that the personal disputes were behind the death of her parents
 wo meraa kharchaa nahin uthaate the
 However, the truth is not only as much as this daughter is telling at the moment, but instead of the police, this daughter wanted to grab property worth millions of her parents
 wo is laalach main itani andhi ho chuki thi ki use maa-baap kii jeena gavaara hi nahin tha
 When the Maruti 800 was launched in 1983, it came with new technology
 usase pehle jo bhi gaadiyaan thim, wo puraani technology par, heavi ful kanzmpshan, heavi stering, pur braking system vaali gaadiyaan thim
 It was the first vehicle that launched with all the things
 asi, izi steering, tamaam chizein thim
 It was a popular vehicle
 26 saal baad maaruti 800kii vidaai ek gaadi kii vidaai nahin thi, ek yug kii vidaai thi
 The reality of the market had written a complete stop on this dream plane
 lekin vakt kaa pahiyaa palat rahaa he
 Ardor's ride is returning maaruti 800
 The name is the same but the color is new
 maaruti 800 ko mil rahaa he nayaa namadarasal 800 waapas to aa rahi he lekin alto ke saath
 That means your dream car will definitely come but with a new crew
 ye car to ek hogi lekin isamen khubiyaan anek hongi
 In India, cricket means Sachin Tendulkar, Hero means Amitabh Bachchan, Ghee means Dalda, Cold means coca-cola and Car means Maruti 800
 maaruti 800 ye naam bharat ke un kuch gine-chune naamon main se ek he, jo rahe na rahe lekin unke naam sadiyon tak yaad rahenge
 It is obvious that how the company has been given the name that has been given to the tongue for the last 28 years
 maaruti suzuki ne faisla kiyaaki aam aadmi kii zindagi se judi is car ko dobaaraa aam aadmi ke bich utaarna he
 But this time the company has taken care that this most loved car of India and the whole of India will be taken on the roads again, but with new style and new look
 diwali ke aasapaas laanch hogi maaruti olto 800bharat main jin do kaaron ne sabase zyaada logon kaa dil jeeta unamem sabase pehla number he aapaki apni maaruti 800 auki doosraa number he maaruti olto
 The icing on the cake is that the company has prepared to present these two precious gems together and present them to you
 ji haa maaruti ne apane in donon kaaron ko ek saath milakar bazaar main utaarne kaa faisla kiya he auki is car kaa naam hoga maaruti olto-800
 That means it will also have a Maruti 800 and the power of Alto
 800 ke jaisi keemat bhi hogi jo aam aadmi ke sapanom ko puraa kare to olto kaa milage hoga jo badhati manhagaai main bhi aapke jeb kaa khyaal rakhegi
 This most awaited car from Maruti is going to be launched around Diwali this year
 maaruti 800 bade shaharon se pehle hi alavida kah chuki he auki company ne puraani alto ko bhi band karne kaa faisla kiya he
 But the new Alto 800 is coming to replace the old Alto and remind the Maruti 800
 maaruti 800 se judi rochak kahaniyanmaruti 800 se judi yaaden tamaam hai
 For someone, a status symbol, for someone a member of the house, for someone, a travel companion for life and for someone lucky
 jitne log, maaruti 800 se judi utani kahaniyaan
 Out of all these stories, some strange stories are presented
 bhopal ke mandaloi sahab ko 10 maheene baad mili maaruti 800-bhopal ke pike mandaloi, bank se ritair ho chuke hai
 The matter is old but Mandloi sir is very well remembered
 puure 10 maheene ke intazaar ke baad inke angan main ai thi 800
 What did the Maruti 800 get, just as Diwali had arrived at Mandloi Saheb's house
 pike mandaloi ne bataaya, 'log sadakon par ikattha ho jate the, dekhte the kiski gaadi he
 In those days, there were only 6-7 vehicles in Bhopal
 log gaadiyaan chalaane ko maangate the lekin main nahin detaa tha
 'it has been 27 years since this vehicle came to his house
 59 hazaar rupye main ye gaadi kharidi thi
 Many times people offered more than this price to sell this car, but PK Mandloi never even thought about it
 unhone bataaya, 'kai log mujhe bolte hai ise bech do, main bolta hum ki bechnaa kya jab ye meraa saath abhi tak de rahi he
 Aaj Tak has not even cheated me
 main everej check nahin kiya lekin phir 17-18 kaa everej hoga
 This Maruti 800 from Mandloi ji was one of the first five cars in Bhopal and they had a white Maruti 800 in the entire city
 27 saal baad bhi mandaloi bandhuon main is gaadi ko lekar junun kam nahin hua he
 After the arrival of new vehicles, he is so attached to this car that he has not left this car
 itani yaaden judi hai ki use ye bechnaa bhi nahin chaahate hai
 When the first Maruti 800 ran in Jaipur, not only Bhopal, but there is a shortage of fans of Maruti 800 in every city of the country
 jaipur ke 84 saal ke professor ke
 L
 camel ke liye maaruti 800 khareednaa kisi bahut bade karname se kam nahin tha
 Professor Kamal remembers his Maruti-800 in the first lot lottery in 1983
 us vakt maaruti 800 kaa itnaa craij tha ki lottery main naam aana hi badi baat thi
 For several days it was reported in local newspapers that Maruti of Japan will now also come to Jaipur
 professor ke
 L
 camel ne bataaya, 'ghar main koi vaahan nahin tha or ichha thi ki ek vaahan luun
 It was possible for people like us living a life of honesty to buy this car
 lottery se pataa nahin kaise number aa gaaya or bacchon ko ye tha ki ghar main gaadi aa gai he
 'professor Kamal has added the Maruti 800 to his progress and perhaps that is why he does not want to take this car away from him
 ghar main duusari gaadiyaan bhi hai lekin professor camel auki unki patni apni is chaheti maaruti 800 main hi safar karte hai
 Professor Kamal said, 'this vehicle has been very auspicious for me
 main us samay professor bhi nahin bana tha jab gaadi ai thi
 If i became the Vice Chancellor of the University with Luxor, it was very good for me
 ' gaadiyaan kai ain or chali gayi lekin maaruti 800 ne logon ke gharon main aisi jagah banaai ki wo sirf ek gaadi na rahakar parivaar kaa hissaa bani
 Vijay Kumar of Pune, Puri - Vijay Kumar Dalvi of Pune also brought home the Maruti 800 with great wishes
 vijay kii zindagi main har pal saath diya unki is muraadon kii car ne
 According to Vijay Kumar Dalvi, 'this is the family member of my house
 kisi buudhe aadmi ko ghar se nikaalte nahin isliye maine ise bhi apane saath rakhaa hua he
 The Maruti 800 is not only the first car in the lives of most people but is also the best selling car in India
 itnaa hi nahin maaruti 800 wo car he jise sabase zyaada logon ne second hand condishan main bhi kharida
 That is why the purchase of the old Maruti 800 is sold even today
 dilachasp he aam aadmi kii car kii kahanijis car ne middle class aadmi ko scooter se utarkar car main savaar kara diya aakhir uski kahani kya he? kaise is company ko bhagwaan kaa naam mila or kiski koshishon se taiyaar hui aam aadmi kii car? ye kahani he bharat kii car kii, ye kahani he aam aadmi kii car kii, ye kahani he sapanom kii car kii
 Sanjay Gandhi, the eldest son of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, dreamed that the car would be driven by middle class people
 sanjay gandhi chaahate the ki kam kharch vaali is car kaa nirmaan bharat main hi kiya jaae
 In 1971, Maruti Udyog Limited was created under the Companies Act and before which Sanjay Gandhi became the Managing Director
 aap tak choti or behtareen kaaren pahunchane ke liye maaruti ko kai padaavon se guzarana padaa
 It took more than two years only with the approval of the government
 phir ek achche partner kii talash main company ne duniya bhar ke bazaaron ko chaanaa
 And then Maruti got the support of Suzuki Motor
 haalanki suzuki motor se pehle maaruti kii saajhedaar ke rup main foxwagon ko chunaa gaya tha
 Volkswagen Golf was the small car to be launched in India
 lekin vah bharat ke hisaab se kuch zyada mahangi pad rahi thi
 The land acquisition dispute with farmers to set up a Maruti cars factory in the country and the Emergency in the country put almost a break on the speed of the work of the common man
 1977 main maaruti udyog limited diwalia ho gai
 The Justice AC Gupta Commission investigated the 'maruti scandal' and submitted its report in 1978
 iske teen saal baad indira gandhi kii pahal par company ko dobaaraa khadaa karne kii koshish hui
 The result of the speed that Maruti caught this time was seen in December 1984 when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi handed over the keys of this car to the hands of a man named Harpal Singh
 harpal singh maaruti car ke pehle maalik bane
 However, the laborers working in the Maruti factory wanted the first Maruti 800 to be presented to Lord Tirupati
 lekin japani maalikon ne unki guzarish thukraa di
 After this, the laborers collected the money and offered the Maruti 800 to Lord Tirupati
 1997 main sarkaar ne maaruti kaa niyantran apane haathon main le liya
 However, in the year 2000, the company was freed from government control and now Maruti is moving towards becoming the world's largest manufacturer of Suzuki cars
 bharat hi nahin balki asia ke kai deshon kii sadakon par maruti kaaren daud rahi hai wo bhi tej, bahut tej
 At the cost of the people, the news of the arrival of Alto 800 has been reported, people are eagerly waiting for this car
 sab is car ko maaruti 800 se jodakar dekh rahe hai
 However, only 800 is named in this car, otherwise its features are beating the existing small cars
 bharat kii sabase chhadi car nirmaataa company in dinon apni sabase pehali car maaruti 800 ke nae varjan ko taiyaar karne main juty he
 The Maruti 800 is the most talked about car in the company's portfolio till date
 company ab ise olto 800 ke naam se nae rang-rup main bazaar main pesh karne vaali he
 It is believed that the price of this car coming by Diwali or by the end of this year will be around 2 to 2
5 lakh rupees
 jaane kya hoga nai olto 800 main khasmaruti kii is nai car kii haal hi main tasviren bhi li hui hai
 These pictures show the car with a better look and interior
 jald hi launch hone vaali is olto 800 main aakhir koun si khubiyaan hai jo ise baaki kaaron se alag banaaegi
 After all, this is a car made by mixing two popular cars together or not
 car export tutu dhawan ke anusaar, 'dekhie ye gaadi unhone puri tarah se badal di he
 The interior has been changed, the car has been given a new look
 kyon alto ko pichley 8 saalon se dekh-dekhakar bor ho gaye the
 So now the car that has come with this change
 to logon main excitement nazar aa rahi he
 'first of all let's talk about the price
