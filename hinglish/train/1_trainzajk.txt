 Model and actor Shyan Munshi is also among the 19 witnesses retracting in the Jessica case
 nyaayamurti es rabindra bhat kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne dilli police kii jirah samaapt hone ke baad kaha ki ham faisla surakshit rakhte hai
 Earlier, the High Court sent notices to all the 19 witnesses and asked the prosecution how all the witnesses turned hostile during the trial
 peeth ne kaha ki bayaan se mukarne kii ghatnaayen aam ho gai hai
 Some people retract for fear of life, some are lured and some people do not support the prosecution for obvious reasons
 peeth ne sawaal kiya ki kya hamen aise sabhi logon ke khilaaf abhiyojan chalaaya janaa chahie
 Jessica Lal was shot and killed in April 1999 by Manu Sharma, son of Haryana Congress leader Vinod Sharma
 jesica ne soshlite binaa ramani ke dakshin dilli sthit restaraan main yojit party main manu ko sharaab dene se manaa kar diya tha
 The High Court overturned the lower court's decision on 18 December 2006 and sentenced Manu Sharma to life imprisonment and later issued notices to witnesses asking why he should not be tried for the offense of perjury
 baad main das gavaahon ko aaropon se bari kar diya gaya
 Earlier, Munshi, who lodged an FIR in the case, requested the court not to prosecute him
 usne kaha tha ki uski gavaahi ke kuch bhaag kaa istemaal ucchtam nyaayalay ne aaropee ko doshi tehraane main kiya tha isliye use mukara hua nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In the Jessica case, the complaint was lodged by Munshi but during the hearing, he retracted saying that he does not know Hindi
 abhiyojan paksh ne adaalat se anurodh kiya tha ki mukarne vaale 31 gavaahon main se munshi sahit 19 gavaahon ke khilaaf juthi gavaahi dene ke aarope main mukadmaa chalaane ke liye maamla magistriti adaalat main bheja jaae
 At the same time, the prosecution also said that out of a total of 31 witnesses, only 19 are available for hearing as three have died and ten themselves have been acquitted by the court in the past on the basis that their police were given And later there is not much variation in the statements given in court
 is maamle main mukarne ke liye adalati karrwai kaa saamana kar rahe 19 logon main soshlite andaleeb sahagal, belistic visheshgy rup singh or prem sagar, electrician shiv shankar das or pratyakshdarshi jagannatha jha shaamil hai
 The bugle for the Maharashtra elections is over, but at the same time there is a conflict between the allies of each other over the seat sharing
 bijepi or shivasena ke bich ab tak siton kaa hisaab nahin sulajh sakaa he
 Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray held an important meeting with the leaders of his party, in which no result has been achieved
 shivasena ke bade netaaon ne bijepi ke saath siton ke bantwaare par koi bhi faisla ab uddhav thakare par chhod diya he
 It was decided at the meeting in 'matoshree' that the party president will take the final decision
 shivasena mukhyamantri pad ke saath-saath 150 siton kii maang kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the BJP, a long-time ally of the Shiv Sena, is not willing to give up its demands
 party adhyaksh amit shah ne saaf kah diya he ki sammaan ke saath kisi tarah kaa samjhauta nahin hoga
 On the other hand, the situation of Congress and NCP in Maharashtra is also similar
 donon partiyon ke bich kalah jari he
 Sunit Tatkare of the NCP has even said that if the issue of seats is not resolved soon, his party will contest the elections alone
 baharhaal, maharashtra ke donon bade gathbandhanon main andruni ghamaasan jari he
 It will be interesting to see what color the seat dispute ultimately brings
 mishan ke liye isro ne kii 11 saal mehnatadesh main bane sabase shaktishaalee launchraham honge kaamyaab
 
 
 You will definitely succeed
 
 
 chandramaa kii sataha par ek din jarur utrega chandrayan
 These voices and lofty intentions belong to the country
 jis mishan ko puraa karne ke liye vaigyanikon ne na jane kitni raaten qurbaan kar deen wo mishan bhale hi kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa lekin iraade kamjor nahin hue hai
 The country is saluting its scientists today

 aasaan nahin chand kaa safarvaigyanik pareekshan ke liye kai upkarnon ke saath rover 14 din tak chand kii jameen par saiyr karne vaala tha lekin lander or rover ke saath chand ke dakshini dhruv tak pahanchane kii taiyaari kaa ye safar itnaa aasaan bhi nahin tha
 ISRO scientists were approved in 2008 for Chandrayaan-2
 tab bhartiya vaigyanikon ke paas apana lander nahin tha
 He was about to get a lander from the Russian Space Agency
 2009 main chandrayan-2 kaa dizin taiyaar hua or janvari 2013 main lonching tay kii gai
 For some reason the Russian space agency could not deliver the lander
 ab isro ke vaigyanikon ne khud isaki taiyaari shuru kii
 The entire project of Chandrayaan-2 was completed at a cost of about 960 crores
 kuch or tarikhon ke talane ke baad 16 july ko chandrayan-2 launch kaa elaan kiya gaya lekin takneekee khaamiyon kii vajah se kuch ghante pehle is par roak laga di gai
 Finally, on July 22, Chandrayaan-2 set out on its journey
 puri tarah swadeshi launture- GSLV MK-III chandrayan 2 ko lekar chand ke safar par nikal padaa
 - Scientists had installed several indigenous devices in the Pragyan Rover for testing
 22 july se lekar 7 sitambar tak sabakuch thik chalata rahaa
 In the 48-day journey, Chandrayaan-2 successfully crossed every stop, but the 11-year-old dream of scientists was suddenly lost by approaching the challenge of stepping on the unknown and untouched part of the moon
 jiske ek-ek lamhe kii khabar rakhane ke liye vaigyanikon kii lambii chaudee team lagaataar isro ke control room main din raat juty thi wo lander ek jatke main kho gaya
 Now scientists are waiting for photos of the orbiter
 bhale hi chandrayan-2 chand kii jameen par soft landing nahin kar sakaa lekin itane bade project ko apane hi desh main or apni hi takanic se taiyaar kar chand tak pahanchane kii kshamta ne sabit kar diya ki bharat antariksh kii daud main duniya se hode lene ke kaabil ban chukaa he

 Ever since Reliance announced Jio 4G, many telecom companies have started reducing data prices
 jaahir he jeeyo ne kaaphi saste plan launch kiye hai to bazaar main bane rahane ke liye duusari companiyon par bhi daam kam karne kaa dabaav he
 After Airtel and Vodafone, now government telecom company BSNL has brought a special plan for wireline broadband
 iske tahat 1 rupee se bhi kam main 1GB data milegaa
 But it is also not so simple, to activate this plan, the user has to use 300GB of data in a month
 reliance ne bhi jeeyo ke tahat 50 rupee main 1GB data dene kaa elaan kiya he, lekin iske liye bhi aapako pehle doosraa pack lenaa hoga
 The chairman and managing director of the company Anupam Srivastavan said in a statement, "BSNL is launching Unlimited BB249
 yah promotional analimited broadband plan 9 sitambar se shuru hoga
 This plan will improve the experience of customers in wireline broadband service and it will also increase our users' According to the company, under this plan, the customer can download at a speed of 2mbps without any data limit
 beasenel ne kaha he ki agar customer ek maheene tak lagaataar is plan ko yuj karata he to 249 rupee de kar 300GB tak downlod kar saktaa he
 That is, less than 1 rupee for 1GB
 chah maheene ke baad customers ko saadhaaran plan main shift kar diya jayega
 However, this plan seems difficult to compete with Jio
 iskaa muqabla karne ke liye telecom companiyon ko bina shart saste plan laane honge
 Because plan users with conditions do not like it

 bijepi ne shuukravaar ko yah maang karke sarkaar par dabaav badha diya he kirel mantriorkanoon mantrike baad abpradhanmantri manmohan sinhako istipha dena chahie
 BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani said, 'now there is no argument to continue in the post of Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri ko bachaa rahe kanoon mantri ko pad se hataane ke faisle ke baad chijen aage badhani chahie
 It is further that the Prime Minister must now resign
 ’ rail mantri pawan kumaar bansal or kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar ke istife ko ‘kaaphi der se’ uthaaya gaya kadam qaraar dete hue bijepi ne sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki uski maang nahin maan kar usne sansad kaa keemtee vakt ‘barbaad’ kiya
 BJP hoped that the investigation of railway bribery scandal will now move in the right direction and the truth will be revealed
 party pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne bataaya, ‘yah der se uthaaya gaya ek kadam he
 If the government had already accepted the bjp's demand, they could have saved the precious time of Parliament from being 'wasted'
 ’loksabhaa main netaa pratipaksh sushamaa swaraj ne ‘twitor’ par likhaa, ‘donon mantriyon kaa istipha dikhaata he ki unke istife kii hamaari maang jaij thi or sarkaar gaiyr-jaruri tareeke se jid par adi thi
 If our demand for his resignation was accepted by the government earlier then the Parliament session could have continued
 ’shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki istife main ‘jaanboojhkar’ deree kii gayi he or mantri ko apane pad par bane rahane kaa koi haq nahin tha
 He claimed that the resignation was delayed due to 'internal differences' within the Congress party
 hossain ne kaha, ‘bijepi netaa sushamaa swaraj ne maang rakhi thi ki yadi donon mantri (kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar or rail mantri pawan bansal) istipha de dete hai, to sansad sucharu rup se chal sakati he
 He wasted valuable time of Parliament by not accepting our demand
 bijepi ab ummid karti he ki railway ghotaale kii jaanch sahi disha main jaaegi
 Describing the resignation as a step taken too late, BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, "the secret of loot is burning now" and "neither the robbers nor their patrons will now be spared
 ’ nakvi ne kaha ki logon kaa gussa ab nafrat main badal chukaa he or janata aagaamee chunaavon main ‘bhrashton ko’ sabak sikhayegi
 The BJP leader said that instead of abruptly adjourning the Parliament session indefinitely, the government should have eliminated corruption and punished those involved
 hossain ne kaha ki party chup nahin baithegi or railway rishwatakhori ke saath-saath sibiai ke kaamkaaj main kanoon mantri ke kathith dakhal kaa mudda uthaati rahegi
 Attacking Ashwani Kumar, Hussain said, "the country wants to know whom the Law Minister wanted to save by changing the draft CBI report
" ’ unhone kaha ki bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh shanivaar ko upie ke khilaaf party kii bhavishya kii ranneeti kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Meanwhile, Bihar Chief Minister and JDU leader Nitish Kumar in Patna appreciated the resignation of Railway Minister Pawan Bansal and Law Minister Ashwini Kumar on Friday night, saying that it was a late move

 chandrababu naidu kii party telugu desham party (tidipi) ko ek or jhatka laga he
 Senior TDP leader and former MLA Ambika Krishna has joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today
 ambika krishna eluru se vidhayak rahe hai or film produsar bhi hai
 Ambika Krishna currently serves as the chairman of AP Film, Theater, Television Corporation
 vaise kuch samay se ve party se duuri banaae hue hi the
 There is chaos in the TDP for his leaving the party
 kuch hi din pehle tidipi ke jeetne vaale saat vidhayakon ke bhi bijepi ke sampark main hone kii baat pataa chali he
 Let us know that since the Lok Sabha elections, TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu is not taking the name of the problem being reduced
 pehle hi tidipi ke chaar rajyasabha saansadon ne party se baghawat kar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he to party ke vidhayak bhi baghawat kar bijepi ke saath jane kii koshish main hai
 Jagan Mohan Reddy's party YSR Congress has won 22 seats in Andhra Pradesh and TDP in 25 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 isi tarah vidhansabha chunaav main kul 175 siton main se 151 wiesar congress, 23 tidipi or ek seat anya ko mili he
 Congress and BJP did not get a single seat
 iske baavjood bijepi andhra pradesh main tidipi kii jagah lene kii jugat main he
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP is eyeing the TDP mlas
 vishakhapatnam se vidhayak ghanta shrinivas ke netritv main kareeb 14 vidhayak bijepi main shaamil hone kii charchaa main he
 Ganta Srinivas is in Colombo with these TDP mlas
 haalanki, ganta shrinivas se jab is sambandh main baat kii gai to unhone ise khaarij karte hue kaha ki wo kaarobaar ke silsile se colombo aae hue hai
 He said, 'I am a TDP MLA and will remain in TDP'
 bataa den ki jagan reddy kii sarkaar banane ke baad andhra pradesh ke vidhansabha adhyaksh ne saaf kar diya he ki koi vidhayak party chhodkar aata he to uski sadsyta radd kar di jaae
 This is the reason why BJP, like the Rajya Sabha in the state, wants to combine two-thirds of the TDP mlas with them so that the defection law does not come in their way
 isiilie bijepi kam se kam tidipi ke 14 vidhayakon ko milaanaa chaahati he
 If the BJP succeeds, Chandrababu Naidu may lose the post of Leader of the Opposition

 The team manager has complained about this to the British Indian High Commissioner

 agar aap naukari karte hai to aapkaa adhik samay offis main bitta hoga or vahaan aapako apane bos se bhi aamanaa-saamana aata rahata he
 On the other hand, if your boss is not good then your functioning also affects your mental state
 aaj ham aapako kuch tips de rahe hai, jisase aap aasaani se bos ke saath kaam kar sakenge
 
 
 - If your boss is bothering you a lot, then first try to know whether you are falling prey to office politics
 offis main zyaadaatar samasya isi kaaran se aati he
 If this is happening due to office politics, then talk to your boss as soon as possible and clear their misconceptions
 - offis main agar aapke bos ko aapke koi dikkat he to aap is dikkat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish karen
 Then find a solution to that problem
 agar kaam ko lekar koi dikkat he to apane kaam ko sudhaaren
 JOB TIPS: Morning shift has taken place in winter, follow these methods to get up early- If the boss directly assigns you any work, then complete it as soon as possible
 hameshaa apni ore se behatar kaam karne kii koshish karen taaki bos ko bevajaah shikaayat karne kaa mauka hi na mili
 - If the boss is not listening to you, then write a mail and say your point
 kai baar aisa hota he ki bos ko lagata he ki aap galati bhi kar rahe hai or palatakar jawaab bhi de rahe hai
 Sending mail is an easy way to avoid this situation, because if any reply is received in an unprofessional manner, you will have a record of it
 - bahes karne or gussa dikhaane se behatar he ki shanti se baat kii jaae
 It may be that talking angrily worsens rather than becoming talk and you have to bear the brunt of it
 isliye apni baat kahen lekin samajhadaari or shanti se
 Romance can be heavy in the office, keep these things in mind - if things have gone awry, which is difficult for you to handle, then you can take help of your colleagues
 sahyogiyon ke alaava aap yah dekhen ki offis main bos kaa kareebi koun he, unhen apni baat samajhane kii koshish karen or apni sthiti ko bataaen

 Input: IANS noida police ne choron ke ek aise gang ko pakadaa he jo chori kii bike se vaardaat ko anjaam dete the
 These people used to have many number plates of a bike
 ek baar jo number plate lagaakar vaardaat ko anjaam dete phir dobaaraa us plate kaa istemaal nahin karte the
 This is the reason why they were left out of the grip of the police
 noida police ne sector-15 ke paas bairicade lagaakar checking kar rahi thi
 Then a scooty and 5 boys on the bike were seen
 unhen dekhte hi police ko shaq hua or rukne ke liye ishaara kiya, lekin paanchon ladke bike or skuti chhodkar bhaagane lage

 chhattisgarh ke bijapur or sukama jile main 27-28 june ko hui muthbhed main 20 naksaliyon ke maare jane ke kendriya rigerv police bal (siarpief) ke daawey ke baad kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram instinctively called the encounter a major success against Naxalism
 chidambaram ke utsaah kii ek vajah yah bhi thi ki muthbhed usee ilaake main hui thi, jahaan 2010 main 75 siarpief jawan naksaliyon ke haathon maare gaye the
 Not only this, what the Chidambaram was saying, the BJP government of the state was also saying the same thing
 yani centre or rajya ke bich koi bhram nahin tha
 But the Congress leaders of Chhattisgarh not only raised doubts about the encounter, but also investigated it and declared it a massacre
 aise main daawey se koi nahin kah saktaa ki muthbhed main begunaah log maare gaye yaa nahin, lekin yah sawaal to uthta hi he ki naksalwad jaise samvedansheel mudde par congress aapas main hi kyon ulajh gai he?muthbhed ke baad kaa ghatnakram dekhen to chidambaram ne dilli main patrakaron ko bataaya ki muthbhed main kai maovadi sargana maare gaye hai
 The names of Somulu, Nagesh and Mahesh topped them
 chidambaram ne kaha, ''siarpief or suraksha balon ne halaat kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya or puri ghatana ko sooyeeboojh nibataya
 Chhattisgarh's Additional Director General of Police (naxal Operation) Ram Niwas claimed that 35-year-old Naxalite named Madkam Suresh was also killed in the encounter
 suresh ko 2007 main dantewada se jail todakar 299 kaidiyon ko faraar karaane kii ghatana kaa kartadharta bataaya jaataa he
 Security forces had already prepared for the latest encounter
 ramanivas ne bataaya ki suraksha agenciyon ko jaankaree mili thi ki orissa ke maovadiyon kaa 'military dalam' or pramukh naksali sargana chintalnar ke jangalon main ek baithak karne ja rahaa he
 It was expected to prepare a plan of major action in this meeting
 halaat se nibatane ke liye suraksha bal teen tukadiyon main bantakar jagargunda, chintalnar or basaguda ke liye kooch kar gaye
 Around 1,000 personnel of the security forces participated in the entire operation
 muthbhed main 20 naksali maare gaye or siarpief ke chah jawan ghayal hue
 One woman was also among the alleged Naxalites killed
 isi bina par mukhyamantri raman singh ne kaha, ''muthbhed par sawaal uthaane vaale yah bataaen ki siarpief ke jawan gambhir rup se kaise jakhmi ho gaye
 Even if a citizen is shot, it is the responsibility of the Naxalites because they were using civilians as human shields
 '' yani sarkaron kii najar main yah muthbhed naksalwad ke khilaaf ladaai main mile kaa pathar sabit hui he
 But the lesson of the governments becoming mithu mittu could not last long
 ahm muddon par congressiyon ke aapas main bhidane kii ravaayat ek baar phir saamne aa gai
 Senior Chhattisgarh Congress leader and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Charan Das Mahant openly came out against the encounter
 mahant ne kaha, ''siarpief ne kathith muthbhed main bhole-bhaale logon kii hatya kii he, na ki naksaliyon ko maaraa he
 On the question of whether his opinion differed from the opinion of the Home Minister
 mahant ne kaha, ''muthbhed ke bare main rajya sarkaar centre sarkaar ko galat jaankaree de rahi he
 We have formed a committee to investigate the matter
 ''adivasee vidhayak kavasi lakhma ke netritv main banaai gai samiti kii jaanch ke baad congress ne daawa kiya ki muthbhed puri tarah farji he
 Half of the people killed in the encounter are teenagers
 chhattisgarh congress ke adhyaksh nandkumar patel or vipaksh ke netaa rabindra choube ne bhi puri ghatana kii nishpaksh jaanch karaane kii maang kar, muthbhed ko vivaadon main laa diya
 Under pressure, the CRPF decided to conduct an internal investigation into the incident
 pradesh congress or apane mantrimandal sahyogi ke is aarope ke baavjood na to congress alaakaman or na chidambaram ne ghatana kii jaanch kii kisi tarah kii pahal kii
 In contrast, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, along with Chief Minister Raman Singh, met promising tribal students from Naxal-affected areas
 isi mulaakaat ke baad raman singh ne dilli main muthbhed par sawaal uthaane waalon ko aade haathon liya
 This jugalbandi of Union Home Minister and Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh gradually ignited the fire of protest in Congress
 mahant ke baad centre ke adivasee maamalon ke mantri ke
 C
 dev ne sidhe chidambaram par hi hamalaa bol diya
 Dev said, "according to the information i have received, half of the people killed in the encounter are teenagers
 is tarah kii muthbhed bardaasht nahin kii ja sakati
 Dev said in a terse tone, "he claims that the bullets do not know the difference between Naxalites and non-naxals
" lekin jo log goli chalaa rahe hai, ve to yah fark kar sakate hai
 Dev is equal to Chidambaram in the cabinet and is much senior to him in the party
 aise main unki baat ko puri tarah khaarij karnaa grih mantri ke liye sambhav nahin tha
 On the other hand, there is also pressure on the Congress that assembly elections will be held in 2013 in Chhattisgarh
 is muthbhed ko lekar saamaajik sanghathanon or adivasee samaaj main jis tarah se shaq kaa maahaul paidaa hua, use dekhte hue congress koi jokhim uthaane kii sthiti main nahin he
 Meanwhile Congress general secretary and in-charge of Chhattisgarh B
 ke
 Hariprasad even went as far as to chuck Chidambaram's initial statement that Chidambaram was "filling the report" received by the state government
 ''aise main 4 july ko jab chidambaram mantrimandal kii baithak se baahar aae to unke sur main vah narmi dikhaai di, jo aam taur par unke swabhaav kaa hissaa nahin he
 Chidambaram said, "I regret it if an innocent man, woman, boy or girl has been killed in the encounter
 '' haalanki tab bhi chidambaram ne maamle kii jaanch karaane yaa siarpief kii karrwai par ungali uthaane kaa koi sanket nahin diya
 But it does not seem that this softening of Chidambaram is going to make any difference in the heat of the tribal and Congress leaders associated with Chhattisgarh
 pradesh ke congressiyon ko dar he ki centre ke is ravaie se party adivasee samaaj main sahanubhuti kho sakati he
 The way in which the swords are drawn in both the camps, the loss and damage to the party in the assembly elections may be there, but at present it is troubling nationwide
 jediu pramukh sharad yadav ke bayaan par chaaron ore hangaamaa machaa hua he
 While the Opposition is furious over the entire matter, Sharad Yadav's daughter Suhasini is defending her father
 suhasini ne kaha ki mere pita ne kuch bhi galat nahin kaha he, isliye maafee maangane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Sharad Yadav commented on the color of South Indian women in the Rajya Sabha, while people called it sexist and racist
 haalanki yadav kaa kahana he ki unhone khubsuurati kii prashansa kii he na ki koi nasli tippanee
 Yadav said that he had raised the question of discrimination against the dark women and not racist remarks
 gauratlab he ki shuukravaar ko rajya sabha main beemaa bill par charchaa ke dauraan sharad yadav ne kaha tha ki south kii mahilaayein saawali to hoti hai, lekin unki body khubasurat hoti he
 When Yadav was making this remark, most of the mps were laughing at Yadav's statement rather than protesting
 itnaa hi nahin yadav ne apni tippanee kaa yah kehete hue bachaav bhi kiya tha ki unhone kuch bhi galat nahin kaha he

 Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani has now set her eyes on the Indian Institute after rejecting a four-year undergraduate course at Delhi University and then getting into two public debates with the director of iit-delhi and the chairman of the board of iit-mumbai
 Off Management (IIM)
 management main post graduate degree pradaan karne kaa adhikaar dekar indian institute of management bill, 2015 vaise dekhne main to iiem ko zyada shashakt banane vaala prathit hota he
 But if we study more deeply, it indicates that its big objective is to bring all 13 iims more under the government's watch
 yah makasad in sansthaanon se chhip nahin sakaa he or kai iiem ke pramukh mantralay kii is harakat ke khilaaf aadhikarik taur par bayaan de chuke hai
 If several passages of the bill are passed in the current form, they will take away the rights currently granted to each iim's Board of Governors and their recommendations will depend on the approval of the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 vivaad ke mukhya bindu vidheyak ke teen khand hai—3 (ke), 35 or 36
 Section 3 (k) states that all the rules made by the IIIMK Governing Boards will require the approval of the Central Government
 section 35 sarkaar ko is baat ke khule adhikaar detaa he ki vah iiem board ke chairman or nideshak kii niyukti par faisla kare
 On the other hand, in section 36, a provision has been made that the rules of the Board which require the approval of the Government include matters related to tenure and salary of employees, admission and establishment of fellowship and scholarship
 sarkaar kis had tak sookshm prabandhan karnaa chaahati he, yah section 27(2) se bhi spasht ho jaataa he
 It says that every IIM director will have to send an account to the government annually
 isamen faikalti samet santhaan ke sabase zyada vetan paane vaale paanch akjicutives ke yogadan kaa vivaran hoga, jo vesantando denge

 Rapid action on the decisions of the governing board is very important for iims

 Like Naik nik kehete hai, ''hamaare pradhanmantri to vaishvik str ke academik santhaan banane kii ichha rakhte hai, lekin is tarah ke niyam hamen ulti disha main le jate hai
 "on June 24, Naik wrote a very angry letter to Irani, in which he said," We are deeply concerned that some of the provisions of the bill have a very serious impact on the autonomy of the institution
 swaittata or javabdehi ke bich adhiktam santulan sunishchit karne ke liye ek aalochanatmak samiksha kii jarurat he
 “institutions are also feeling a betrayal as sections 35 and 36 were not part of that initial draft of the bill in 2014, which all iims agreed to
 nik kehete hai, ''lagbhag dhai saal ke vichaar-vimarsh main hamane takreeban darjanabhar baithken kin or phir sitambar-aktubar 2014 main ham vidheyak ke ek masaude par sahamat hue the
 But this is a completely new draft
 ''maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kii adhyakshata main sabhi iiem ke liye ek koordination forum banane kaa bhi sheersh iiem virodh kar rahe hai
 The Bhargava committee, formed in 2008 to review the performance of iims, recommended a pan-iim board
 management sansthaanon ne kamity kii in siforeeshon or 2012-13 main sabhi iiem ke kaamkaaj par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye ek council banane ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke ek prastaav, donon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 iim-bangalore Director Sushil Vachhani argues that the coordination exercise in all iims is very difficult in itself, so excessive coordination can sometimes backfire
 vachhaani kehete hai, ''jab jaruri hota he, iiem main samanvay hota hi he or har santhaan saajhe maamalon par kisi ek santhaan se yaa sansthaanon ke samooh ke saath sahyog karne ke liye swatantra he
 For example, in the case of Common Admission Test (CAT), iims coordinate with each other with great success
 ''sabhi iiem kii sthapana sarkari kosh se hui thi or unamem se adhiktar apane astitv ke liye ab bhi sarkaar kii sahaayta par nirbhar hai
 But he has the freedom to build his model to raise revenue
 is model main companiyon ke chande se lekar purv chaatro ke yogadan or kansalatency sevaaon se mila dhan, sab shaamil he
 The top four iims are continuously attracting private sector funding
 isse unhen zyada se zyada swaittata hasil karne kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 For example, iim-ahmedabad director Ashish Nanda says that his institute has become the first management institute in the country to pay Rs 200 crore in the last financial year
 kaa rajasav arjeet kiya he
 1,000 crore on the establishment of a new IIM according to some estimates
 se kuch zyada kharch padataa he or sheersh ke chaar iiem ko chhodkar baaki sab sarkaar kii sahaayta par kaaphi nirbhar rahete hai
 This explains why the new iims are not coming forward to criticize the government on the 2015 Bill
 iiem-raipur ke nideshak bi
 s
 sahay ne to yahaan tak kaha he ki swaittata khone kii ashankaayen nirmul hai
 Sahai claims that he has never faced government interference and at the same time he is ready for accountability, because in his eyes “iims use public money
 '''saarvajanik dhan' ke tark kaa zikr bhargav samiti ne bhi apni report main kiya tha
 The report said, "iims are established by the government with public funds, so they are considered public institutions, so they cannot expect the government to be completely independent
" '' india today ne in vivaadit anuchhedon ke peeche ke tark ko jaanane ke liye is dauraan videsh yatra par gayi smriti irani se phone or i-mail ke jariye sampark karne kii koshish kii lekin unki ore se koi jawaab nahin mila
 In its defense, the Ministry of Human Resource Development is trying to present a general inquiry directed to iims that they are not doing much in terms of fundamental research
 mantralay kii website kahati he, ''management ke phelo program ko job market main piechdi jitani haisiyat nahin mili he, khaas taur par faikalti kii niyuktiyon ke maamle main
 As a result, the Fellow Program in Management (which is equivalent to phd) has not managed to attract talented students
 prastaavit vidheyak isi antar ko paatega
 The committee recommended that adequate infrastructural facilities should be provided for research
 lekin nayaa vidheyak is baat par khamosh he ki research kii gunvattta ko kaise badhaayaa jayega
 The draft of the 2015 Bill is also seen as an attempt to reverse the efforts made by the UPA government in 2012
 us samay in sansthaanon ke kaamkaaj par nigaraanee rakhane vaale memorenda of association par sansthaanon ke sanshodhano ko sweekaar kar liya gaya tha
 This gave him more freedom to appoint chairpersons and directors and fix fees
 media main hui aalochana or kai iiem ke pramukhon kii ore se jataae gaye virodh ke baad maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke adhikariyon ne sanket diya he ki prastaavit vidheyak ke kuch vivaadit anuchhedon ko hataane ke bare main mantralay ke bheetar salaah-mashvire kii prakriya chal rahi he
 The final decision will be taken after the HRD minister returns to the country on July 3, when he is likely to meet the heads of IIM again
 lihaaja is vidheyak ke sansad ke monsoon satr main pesh hone kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 In such a situation, iim's eyes will be constantly on the footsteps of the ministry as a tool to encroach on their autonomy in the form of a pseudo bill for their rights

 He also tried to snatch the ballot paper
 meraa maananaa he ki unhone kal hi ye kahani garh lee thi or shadyantr kii yojana bana lee thi
 Our polling agent immediately raised this issue but we thought that the Election Commission has to decide on it

 The comments ye apratyaksh rup se us niyam ke khilaaf he jisamen saaf he ki mantriparishad 15 fisadi se zyada nahin ho saktaa
 The Chief Minister has the entire system, so he cannot keep Prashant Kishore in this way

 film kaa pehla foster kirdaaron se phul najar aa rahaa he, magar film housephul hogi yaa nahin, ye public tay karegi
 This question also needs to be asked because Sajid's previous film Himmatwala did not even ask for water at the box office
 hamashakals ke poster main film ke teenon lead kalakaar teen geoup main najar aa rahe hai
 Looking at the theme, it seems that once again the story has been woven on the lines of the Shakespearean Comedy of Errors
 jisamen teen dost tripal role main najar aaenge or ek duusare kii life ko narak banaaenge
 After delivering fun and hit movies like 'hey Baby', 'housefull', 'housefull-the Dirty Dozen', what is Sajid Khan's plan-of-action this time to tickle the audience? Well, maybe the second poster of the film got its clue
 lekin itnaa zarur he ki angrezi filmon se 'insapred' sajid khan ne jitendra kii puraani 'himmatwala' kii rimek 'himmatwala' ko mili chaupat rispons se sikh zarur lee hogi
 If you look at the words seen in the poster at the moment, then the filmmakers are making this claim - Crazy + London Camp + Rich + Insane = 9 times the fun and if there is courage, then watch the trailer of Himmatwala

 Is the government preparing for a siege on social media? This question is because to stop the rumors and fake news on social media platforms, the government has not only started discussions with these companies but has also shared with them the blueprint of new rules to replace the old ones
 sarkaar ne in daavon kaa purajor khandan kiya he ki yah abhivyakti kii aazaadee par roak lagane kii koshish he
 The government says that this is being done because incidents of misuse of social media platforms have also come to light recently
 isi saal kii shuruyaat main whatsap par baccha chori kii afavaahon ke chalate mob liching kii kai ghatnaayen huin jinamein bheed ne 30 se adhik logon ko peet-peet kar maar daalaa
 Investigation agencies also complain that these platforms are also being used to spread terrorism, separatism, violence and hate
 darasal, san 2010 se lagu hue information technology act main i gavarnence ko sugam banane or computer se shuru hone vaale aparaadhon ko rokane kaa praavdhaan he
 In section 79, social media companies are given some exemption from accountability
 jabaki 79(2)(si) main unase dishanirdesh paalan karne kii apeksha kii gai he
 Now after the increasing incidents of misuse of social media platforms, the government wants to issue new guidelines
 inamen praavdhaan hoga ki 50 lakh se adhik yujar vaale plateform sarkaar ke poochne ke 72 ghanton ke bheetar sandesh kaa strot bataaen
 For this, conversations have been started with social media platforms and messaging services such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, whatsapp, Yahoo etc
 sarkaar ne internet seva dene vaali companiyon se bhi baatcheet kii he
 Suggestions are also being sought from them
 sarkaar kii koshish 15 janvari tak yah prakriya puri kar lene kii he
 The government says that it does not want to end end to end encryption on platforms like whatsapp
 isamen sandesh bhejne se lekar sandesh paane tak puri prakriya gupt hoti he or isamen koi dakhal nahin ho saktaa
 This is the specialty of whatsapp that makes it popular
 whatsap sarkaar ko bataa chuki he ki isamen parivartan karne kaa matlab hoga is plateform ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa
 The government says that it does not want to read the messages running on whatsapp
 lekin agar koi sandesh nafrat yaa afvaah failaane vaala ho, to uske strot kii jaankaree jarur milani chahie
 whatsapp says that it is working on technology for this
 usne bharat main ek adhikari bhi niyukt kiya he
 Advertisements were also given in newspapers to prevent fake news
 is bich, sarkaar kaa kahana he ki inase jude sabhi pakshon kii raay milane ke baad hi puraani guidelins ko badalane kaa faisla hoga
 On the other hand, it is also being reminded that recently the Home Ministry has allowed 10 agencies to monitor or seize computer data
 isiilie ab sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya sarkaar kii yah koshish abhivyakti kii aazaadee par hamalaa he? yaa maujuuda haalat main soshal media ke durupyog ko rokane ke liye sakht dishanirdeshon kii behad jarurat he?disclemur (asveekaran) : is aalekh main vyakt kiye gaye vichaar lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 khatter ke saamne jat-gaiyr-jat ke bich santulan banane kii chunautikisaan, aarakshan, 75 fisadi haryana ke yuvaaon ko job mudde hanharyana main bijepi ne jejepi ke saath milakar bhale sarkaar bana lee ho, lekin mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ke sir kaanton bharaa taj he
 It will be a big challenge for Manohar Lal Khattar to harmonize between Jat and non-jat as well as fulfill the promises made by the JJP in the elections
 jabaki, jejepi pramukh or dipti siem bane dushyant chautaala apni siyaasi aadhaar badhaane ke liye apane vaadon ko har haal main amalijama pehanaane kii kavayad karenge
 Actually, the BJP had issued a 'sankalp Patra' and JJP 'jan Seva Patra' to win the Haryana election battle
 donon partiyaan apane-apane loklubhaavan vaade lekar janata ke bich utre the
 jjp's promises were somewhat more populist than bjp's
 bijepi-jejepi ke ghoshnaa patron main kai vaade juda bhi the
 In such a situation, when the two have formed a government together, it has become a challenge to keep pace with the same promises
 jat or gaiyr-jat ke bich santulanaharyana main bijepi ke raajnneetik aadhaar badhane ke peeche gaiyr-jat chhavi kaa hona sabase bada factor rahaa he
 As a result of this, all the veteran Jat leaders of BJP have lost the election
 bijepi ke 22 main se 5 jat netaa hi chunaav jeet paae hai
 All the seats BJP has got are from non-jat area
 jabaki, jejepi kaa aadhaar puri tarah se jat samudaay ke bich hi simata hua he
 Dushyant Chautala has emerged as the young face of the Jat community
 is tarah se mukhyamantrimanohar laal khatter ke saamne haryana ke jat or gaiyr-jatako ek saath lekar chalane kii chunauti hogi
 Whereas, in front of Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, the challenge will be to take steps to improve his image among the Jats of the state
 kisaanon ke mudde par ekamat hongabjapi ne kisaanon ke liye fasali rinon par 5 hajaar karod ke byaaj or jurmaana maaf karne ke lakshya ko puraa karne kaa vaada kiya he
 Whereas, the JJP has promised to waive the entire debt of the cooperative banks of the farmers
 saath hi kisaanon kii jameenon kii nilaamee par pabandi lagane or samarthan mulya se kam fasal kharid ko aparaadh ghoshit kaa vaada kiya he
 In this way, it will not be easy for Khattar and Dushyant to move forward together on the issue of farmers
 aarakshan par pechajegepi ne privet skulon main garibon ke bacchon ke aarakshan ke daayaron ko badhaakar 20 fisadi karne kaa vaada kiya he
 Whereas BJP is giving 10% reservation to economically poor upper caste community
 bijepi ne yuvaaon ko mudra lone skim ke jariye swa rojgaar se jodne kaa vaada kiya he to jejepi ne haryana main 'rojgaar meraa adhikaar' adhinium ke tahat 75 pratishat naukariyaan haryana ke yuvaaon ke liye arakshit karne kaa vaada kiya he
 In such a situation, it will not be easy for Manohar Lal Khattar to increase the scope of reservation and make 75 per cent employment in the youth of Haryana
 isi tarah se sarkari karmchaariyon kii puraani pension behaal ko lekar bhi jejepi or bijepi ke bich saamanjasy bananaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The JJP made the restoration of the old pension policy of employees an election issue
 iske alaava jejepi ne khilaadiyon ke liye antarrashtriya padak jeetne kii protsaahan raashi doguni karne or sarkari naukari kii guarantee kii di he
 On the other hand, the BJP has promised a pension of 3 thousand for the elderly, while the JJP has promised to give the pension of the elderly Rs 5100
 is tarah se in vaadon ko amalijama pehanaanaa dushyant chautaala ke liye aasaan nahin hoga to manohar laal khatter ke liye apane votbank ko sadhakar rakhane kii badi chunauti hogi
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance for the assembly elections may have been broken, but it will remain at the Center and BMC
 biemasi chunaavon ke baad bijepi or shivasena donon ke parshadon ne jonal ayukta ko likhit main diya tha ki ve 5 saal tak ek-duusare kaa saath nibhaayenge
 In this sense, their alliance will remain in BMC till 2017, but if any party decides to leave the alliance then it will have to go through a legal process
 vahiin sutron kaa kahana he ki shivasena kendra main apana ek maatr mantri pad nahin chhodeygi or ho saktaa he is par koi bhi faisla vah chunaavon ke baad hi le
 The Anant Geete Center of Shiv Sena has a heavy industries minister

 america, madhya purv se prashanth tak samudri sanchaar maarg main ek atyadhik mahatvapurn bhoorannitik sthaan par sthit bharat ke saath adhik gaharaa judaav chahta he
 This is said by a top US military officer
 joint chinas of staff ke adhyaksh, general martin dempsi ne guuruuvaar ko videshi media se kaha, 'ham kuch samay se kah rahe hai ki ham bharat ke saath ek gaharaa rishta or adhik judaav chaahate hai
 When Dempsey was asked to compare America's relationship with India and Pakistan, he said, "I understand that he (india) currently holds the second position and soon, you will know, what you understand On that basis, it will soon be the largest country in the world
 'dempsi ne kaha, 'vah madhya purv se prashanth tak samudri sanchaar maarg main ek atyant mahatvapurn bhoorannitik sthaan par he
 And it is the largest democracy in the world
 isliye, jahaan tak meri smriti ja sakati he, ham kaaphi samay se unke saath gaharaa judaav chaah rahe hai
 Dempsey said that Washington's relationship with Pakistan, on the other hand, has always been surprising and often disappointing
 dempsi lagbhag 2005 se hi america-pakistan ke rishte par kaam kar rahe hai
 Dempsey continued, 'I have been immersed in it for seven years, and i would like to say that it has always been astonishing for us
 'unhone kaha ki ek taraf unhone kuch muddon par sahyog kiya, to vahiin apane kabyli ilaake main taliban kii upasthiti jaise kai anya muddon par sahyog nahin kar paae
 Dempsey said, 'we did some things very well
 hamane apane kuch hiton ke aadhaar par bina shart sahyog kiye, lekin vahiin kuch aise bhi mudde hai jinpar sahyog va sahmati bana paane main ham aksham sabit hue
 Dempsey specifically pointed to the Haqqani network, saying, "the presence of the Afghan Taliban in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is one of those issues
" ' Baba Ramdev has a special conversation with Aaj Tak on the question of taking away all rights including voting of more than two children in India
 unhoneajatak ke ankar rohit sardanase khaas baatcheet main kaha ki unka yah bayaan kisi bhi samudaay ke liye nahin, balki deshhit ko dhyaan main rakhkar diya gaya tha
 Ramdev argued behind his statement that when the country was liberated 70 years ago, the population of the country was 30-35 crores, but in the seventy years of independence, we have quadrupled the population of our country
 unhone kaha ki deshavaasiyon ko aane vaale 50-100 saalon ke bare main sochna chahie ki itane samay baad desh main kaise halaat honge
 Yoga teacher Ramdev said that he will serve the country at least 50 to 70 years now
 unhone kaha ki main apni ankhon ke saamne aisa bharat nahin dekhnaa chahta jisaki aabaadi 250 karod ho jaae
 i do not want to see an India where there are no schools and colleges for children to study, hospitals for treatment, no jobs to work, no children who become a burden on the country
 hamaare bachche kisi bhi myne main goron se peeche na rah jaaen
 He said that i am a monk, i do not live a worldly life, but i worry about the country
 unhone aage kaha ki agar desh ke bare main ek sanyasi nahin sochega to koun sochega
 At the same time, Ramdev emphasized that it is an issue of social awareness and not a political statement
 unhone kaha ki kendriya raajnneeti main health, ajukeshan, population jaise mudde hone chahie
 He also reiterated his statement that the statement with two children has nothing to do with religion or richness or vote bank
 ramdev ne aage kaha ki aaj kaa naaraa- 'ham do, hamaare do, sabake do' kaa hona chahie
 He said that there is a need to look at the matter of population with foresight and think about it
 saath hi unhone kaha ki aane vaale samay main is maamle par chunaav jite or haare jaaenge
 He said that we need to see how many citizens of which country are aware, healthy and prosperous
 hamaare desh main sakshartaa, garibi, health, nutrishan kaa rate bahut kam he
 But there are many countries in the world where countries with less population have made good progress
 isroyal ko dekhie, vahaan ke naagarik kam hai, lekin unka desh pragati kar rahaa he
 The people of India should not be less respected than Japan or Israel
 main chahta hum ki hamaare desh main aane ke liye log bharat ke videshon main bane duutavaason ke baahar line lagaakar khadey rahen
 On the question of political statement, Ramdev said that i have only one way - service of Mother India
 unhone kaha ki desh se bada kuch nahin hota
 i have said this only for the good of the country, i have to work for this country for 70 more years
 iske saath hi unhone kaha- main laabh-haani ke bare main sochakar nahin bolta, main saarvbhaumik satya bolta hum
 i am from the country giving slogan of Satyamev Jayate
 yahi meraa bhi naaraa he
 He admitted - My effigies are burnt daily, Hindus also blow, Muslims also blow, but in spite of this, they will continue to speak the universal truth
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle priyanka gandhi kii raajnneeti main entry or unki pradhanmantri narendra modi se tulana par bhi ramdev bole
 He said that Modi's personality is very big
 vah desh ke liye 18 ghante kaam karte hai
 With this, he said that Priyanka ji is a dynamic sister
 unka raajnneetik anubhav or desh ke liye yogadan modi ji jitna nahin he
 Maybe she will contest elections in the coming days, Sonia ji has become quite old
 priyanka apni maa kii seat raibareli se chunaav bhi lard sakati hai
 She will have to show what she can do about the creation of the country
 is samay priyanka or modi kii tulana karnaa sahi nahin he
 Both have different age and experience
 desh main chal rahe raajnneetik gathjod par ramdev ne kaha ki is samay chal rahaa dangal bahut joardaar he, isse raashtra kaa mangal hona chahie
 Explain that earlier Baba Ramdev had said in an event in Aligarh that people who have more than two children, their voting rights should be taken away and they should not be allowed to contest elections
 iske saath hi unhone kaha tha ki aise logon ko sarkari naukari or treetment facility se bhi vanchit kar dena chahie
 Then whether such people are Hindu or Muslim

 jo itane shaatir hote hai ki dur baithkar hi logon ke atm se paise nikaal lete hai
 The victim comes to know when the message of withdrawing money comes from the bank on her mobile
 jab tak peedit kuch soche, tab tak unka bank acount khaali hi chukaa hota he
 In this era of fast running technology, ATM fraudsters are also finding new ways in which to rob people
 aajkal sabase zyada atm frod, card chloning ke jariye kii ja rahi he
 To clone ATM cards, people go to the ATM machine and install a skimmer device
 ye skimar card swap karne vaali jagah ke upar lagata he
 It seems as if it is part of the ATM machine
 saath hi kii board ke upar ek bahut chota camera laga dete hai
 When the ATM card is installed in the machine, it clones it
 atm kaa password camere main darj ho jaataa he jab graahak apana code daal rahaa hota he
 During this time there is no one other than the ATM card holder in the ATM, but later the fraudster clones the card through this and goes away and withdraw money from the ATM from anywhere
 isaki soochna asli atm card maalik ko tab pataa chalati he, jab uske mobile par tranjection massej aata he
 Some precaution is also taken to avoid such fraud
 jab bhi atm main jaaen, card swap karne vaali mashin ko hilaakar dekh le, agar wo hill rahi he to iskaa matlab kuch gadabad he
 Also, check the top side of the board properly whether there is any camera
 agar kuch gadabad najar aaye to fouran bank staff ko khabar karen
 There is no day in Delhi and NCR when these ATM fraudsters do not make people their victims

 It was learned that the money was withdrawn from an ATM in Ghaziabad
 yah chori atm card chloning ke jariye hui
 Delhi Police says that many people come to the police station every day to report the withdrawal of money from the ATM

 The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to India on Tuesday for two days after Pakistan
 piem modi ke nimantran par bharat aa rahe prince ke is daure par donon deshon ke bich aatankwaad or nivesh se jude kai samjhaute ho sakate hai
 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud will call on top ministers and leaders including PM Modi during his visit
 haalanki, is baat kii ummid kam hi he ki saudi arab 'seemaa paar aatankwaad' par koi sakht bayaan de,kyonki vah pakistan kaa kareebi dost he
 The Saudi Arabian government said last week that it was with it in India's fight against terrorism and extremism and called the terror attack in Pulwama in Kashmir a 'cowardly' attack
 saudi arab kii sarkari samachar agency ke anusaar vahaan ke videsh mantralay ne kaha tha ki saudi arab 'kyrana aatanki hamalon' kii majammat karata he or vah 'aatankwaad evam charampanth ke khilaaf apane dostana ganatantr bharat ke saath khadaa he
 'what can be found? a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs of India told reporters on Thursday,' The two countries may be negotiated on a number of key issues like investment, defense, security, counter-terrorism, renewable energy
 ' prince kaa pehla bharat daura aise samay main ho rahaa he jab kashmir ke pulavama main bade aatanki hamale se bharat main aatankwaad ke prati aakrosh kaa maahaul he
 In such a situation, both countries can increase cooperation in dealing with terror
 is baat ummid ki bharat or saudi arab ke sanyukt bayaan main aatankwaad ke khilaaf 'sakht tippanee' kii ja sakati he
 However, it is unlikely that words like 'cross-border terrorism' will be used
 saal 2016 main jab piem modi saudi arab ke shahar riyaad ke daure par gaye the tab sanyukt bayaan main 'seemaa paar aatankwaad' shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya gay tha
 However, this time India will try to make Pakistan fully aware of the situation
 vyapaar main asantulandonon deshon ke bich paraspar vyapaar main palada saudi arab kii taraf jhukaa hua he
 India has a large middle class and market, with considerable scope for investment for Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia has not given it any special consideration
 iske alaava bharat ke un deshon se bhi kareebi rishte hai jinase saudi arab ke rishte achche nahin hai, jaise iran, karat or isroyal
 Significantly, Saudi Arabia is the fourth largest trading partner of India
 donon deshon ke bich salanaa kareeb 28 arab dollar kaa vyapaar hota he
 Saudi Arabia supplies about 20 per cent of India's crude oil requirement
 saudi arab main kareeb 41 lakh bhartiya samudaay ke log rahete hai, jo vahaan kii kul jansankhya kaa kareeb 13 fisadi he
 The Indian government is expecting that Saudi Arabia will invest in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) here
 saudi arab kii diggaj tel company aramko bharat ke rifineriyon main nivesh kii sambhaavna talash kar rahi he
 Leaning towards Pakistan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have entered into a total of seven agreements worth around $ 20 billion on Sunday
 is tarah aarthik rup se dub rahe pakistan ke liye saudi arab bada sahaara banakar aayaa he
 Under this, Saudi Arabia's investment in Pakistan will increase every month
 bharat is baat se waakif he ki pakistan or saudi arab ke bich nazdikiyaan kaaphi bad rahi hai
 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has visited Saudi Arabia twice after assuming office in August last year
 iran ke newclear deal se america ke baahar hone ke baad saudi arab ek baar phir se apni suraksha ke liye parmaanu sampann desh pakistan par nirbhar ho gaya he
 Many members of the Saudi royal family have also been served by Pakistani soldiers
 pakistan ne saudi arab main sankat ke samay use sainya sahyog diya he
 Therefore, Saudi Arabia has more inclination towards Pakistan

 The organization of lawyers who helped such people made a lot of efforts to reduce the fine amount to less than US $ 1700
 1700 amareeki dollar matlab bhartiya rupee main ek lakh rupee se bhi adhik kaa fine
 Somehow it was reduced to $ 700 i

 While all other media institutions failed to estimate the verdicts of the Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections, the India Today - Axis My India exit poll presented a true picture of the 'mann Ki Baat' of 11 crore voters in the two states

 The picture of the Haryana Assembly election results on Thursday was almost similar to the India today-axis My India exit poll forecast
 haryana chunaav nateezon main bijepi ko 40, congress ko 31 or jejepi ko 10 siton par jeet mili
 All other exit polls failed to catch the right pulse of the voters of Haryana
 'republic- jan kii baat' ne apane agsit pole main haryana main bijepi ko 52-63 or congress ko 15-19 milane kaa anumaan vyakt kiya
 At the same time, 'news 18 - IPSOS' showed 75 seats to BJP and 10 seats to Congress in Haryana

 Shanno Begum, a resident of Dakshinpuri in Delhi, is a common woman, but there is something special among them
 shanno purushon ke varchasv maane jane vaale ek kshetra main bina kisi hichak yaa dar ke puri kushalta se judi hai
 Shani's vehicle with steering in hand when he stops at a red light or leaving a female passenger on his floor confident Shanno when the car reverses, the other taxi or auto rickshaw drivers standing side-by-side look at him with surprise, But unaware of all these things, Shanno does her work with seriousness
 kuch aise hui is kahani kii shuruyaat10 saal pehle pati kii mrityu ke baad se vah bamushkil apana ghar chalaa rahi thim
 Then he started driving cab after learning driving from Azad Foundation

 But the initiative of hiring female cab drivers from taxi companies like Ola, Veera, Sakha, Priyadarshini in crowded cities like Delhi, Mumbai is a big stop for women using their service
 saath hi in mahilaon kaa yah kaam mahilaon ko barabari kaa ehsaas bhi detaa he
 Safe transportation for women
 Such services are empowering the weaker sections of the society or the less educated women on the one hand
 iske saath hi akele yatra kar rahi mahilaon ko bhi ye kuch had tak chintamukt kar rahi hai

 haalanki purushon ke varchasv vaale is peshey main har baar mahila driveron kaa milanaa aasaan nahin hota
 Statistics prove that kimhila drivers are the least responsible for fatal accidents, but it is still believed that women cannot drive efficiently

 This problem is in every corner of the world, the situation is almost the same in all the countries of the world
 aap landan, beijing, bharat yaa neuyork kahin bhi cab book karaaen, sambhaavna yahi he ki driver purush hi hoga
 Even in developed countries like USA, the number of women taxi drivers is only 2 percent
