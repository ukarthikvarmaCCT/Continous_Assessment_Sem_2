 aisi ghatnaon ke peeche kamjor system kaa haath he
 If someone molests, it takes a lot of time to get his hearing and legal action done so that there is no fear in anyone's heart from committing such a crime
 jabaki america jaise deshon main fatafat sunwaayee hoti he or ek maheene ke bheetar sajaa mil jaati he, lekin hamaare yahaan aisa system nahin hai
 When stringent laws are enacted and our system will speed up and the guilty will be punished quickly, then people will be afraid of committing such crimes because they will understand that if we do something then i will have to eat the air of jail
 or jab system badalegaa tabhi samaaj main badlaav aayega

 It is far from proving this allegation

 From this, it can be estimated that the level of corruption in the state has reached
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya ki pradesh bhar kii khadaanen bhaajapa netaaon ke rishtedaaron ke naam aavantit kar di gayi hai

 unhone kaha ki agle saal tak pradesh ek lakh karod rupee se zyada ke karj tale dab saktaa he

 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ajay Singh raised questions on the policy and intention of the BJP government of the state on the issue of corruption
 unhone kaha, ‘mukhyamantri centre se maang kar rahe hai ki vah madhyapradesh vishesh nyaayalay vidheyak 2011 ko manjuuri de
 But the government headed by him has not yet approved prosecution against 12 ministers of the state in old cases of corruption

 agar aap bhi jindagi ke us padaav par hai jahaan shishe ke saamne khadey hokar aapako khushi nahin balki chintaa hone lagi he to ab sanbhalane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Increased abdominal fat, double chin and unformed body have become the biggest problems of today
 haalanki is sthiti ko vakt rahete, thodi si saavdhaanee apanaakar roka ja saktaa he
 But in most cases people accept obesity and lose courage
 par kya aapane kabhi ye sochaa he ki motaape kii vajah kya he?visheshgyon kii maane to hamaare khaane-pine kii kuch aadaten hi hamaare motaape ke liye jimmedaar hoti hai
 If you also eat time-to-time, do not have breakfast, then your chances of getting fat increases
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki dieting karke wo motaape ko niyantrit kar sakate hai, par dieting ke naam par khaanaa-pinaa chhod dene se yaa sirf ek hi cheez ke bharose baith jane semotopa ghatane ke bajaay bad jayega
 People usually make these mistakes during dieting and they are not even aware that they are making a mistake
 1
 Carbohydrates give up food
 Carbohydrates work to calm our hunger
 aise main achaanak se carbohydrate chhod dene se bhukh shant nahin ho paati or ham lagaataar kuch na kuch khate hi rahete hai
 Whereby obesity increases rather than decreases
 2
 Eating too much dry fruits and fruits can eat a lot of dry fruits or fruits instead of health
 kai falon or mewan main bharpoor maatra main sugar hoti he
 In such a situation, excessive consumption can lead to obesity
 3
 Consuming too much protein helps in the production of protein, but taking too much of protein can be dangerous
 bahut adhik protein lene par uski utani khapat nahin ho paati he or wo fat ke rup main sharir main jamana shuru ho jaataa he
 4
 khaane kii jagah protein baar khanaprotein baar khaanaa aaraamdeh ho saktaa he lekin ye khaane kaa vikalp to bilkul bhi nahin he
 Also, they contain a lot of sugar, which increases rather than reduces obesity
 5
 Leaving breakfast usually makes every person dieting this mistake
 subah kaa naashtaa chhod dena yaa phir sirf taral lenaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Breakfast is a must for carbohydrates, fiber and sugar
 6
 If you are on diet if you drink less water during juice cycle, then it is certain that you have made juice a part of your life, but have you stopped drinking water in this cycle? If yes, this situation can be dangerous for you

 par isamen kitna sach he? pushkar or bundi samet rajya ke duusare paryaton shaharon kii badalati aabhohawaa kii padtaal karen to paryaton vikaas ke samanaantar chal rahaa saanskrithik pradooshan kahin zyada chintajanak najar aata he
 The dress, dress and behavior of foreigners is increasingly dominating the local culture
 dekhte hai kaise?pehla drishy bundi jile ke pramukh picnic spot or ghaney nirjan jangalon ke bich sthit water phal kaa
 This scene became a common sight in the last three months
 aath-das videshi yuvak-yuvatiyon kaa nunatam vastron main din bhar dive lagaataa, nahaana or athkheliyaan karnaa
 From their perspective, it is common
 lekin sthaneey yuvatiyon ke liye sharmaane or munh ghuma lene vaala
 What if there is a curious invitation to the local youths and an unintentional invitation to the apostles / antisocial elements? Similar waterfalls and picnic spots including Bhimalat are crowded on Sundays and other days of the holiday
 aise main gidon kii salaah se sailaani vahaan moujmasti ke liye saamaanya din chunate hai
 In such a situation, there is always a danger for them themselves
 puraani bundi main videshi yugal ja rahaa he
 Suddenly they stop and start kissing lips with lips
 aasapaas koi mahila yaa yuvati guzar rahi ho to ghadon pani pad jaae
 Many times in the night many tourist couples are also seen in objectionable state
 sharaab, bear, bhaang yaa charas ke nashe main hona unke liye to saadhaaran-si baat he, yahaan ke logon ke liye jarur vah hauva he
 Foreign tourists drink the coolness of cannabis in the name of Power Lassi, it is also easy to get the smell of charas and hemp
 sharaab or bear vagairah to unke liye aam he
 Jayaprakash Tripathi, a teacher living in the tourist area Balchand Pada, is directly involved, "the foreigners' dress and wayward sexual behavior is ruining the new generation
" aisa vyavhaar tivi yaa film ke parde kii tulana main pratyaksh or rosemara kii jindagi main dikhne par yuva dilodimag par kahin zyada gaharaa asar karata he
 "more and more impressions of foreigners have started appearing in certain areas of the city
 kai yuvak romeo ke role main najar aane lage hai
 Drug abuse is also increasing due to drug addicts from Pushkar
 athek baras pehle ek paryatak nashe ke chalate maut ke munh main ja chukaa he
 Listen to the story of an elderly couple Mahendra Thakor and Anima Thakore - whose only son lives in the US
 makaan badhiya banavaakar guest house isliye kholaa ki man laga rahegaa
 The first tourist came so that he locked himself in the room, burnt the bed-mattress
 ghabaraae dampati ne police bulaai, teen-chaar ghante tamaashe ke baad vah chat se kudakar bhaaga
 From then on, that couple avoided it
 na keval videshi yuvatiyon ke bhed kholte vastra hamaari paramparaagat veshbhusha par haaavee ho rahe hai balki khud unke liye bhi nuksandeh sabit ho rahe hai
 Last August, a young man molested and indecent with French tourist Cedrin Anna
 yuvati ke mitra brovi maiks ne uskaa photo bhi khinch liya tha lekin us yuvak kaa pataa nahin chalaa
 Earlier, there have been incidents of molestation of tourist girls on Mayuri's umbrella located on the hill
 videshi paryatakon ko samajhaana or aisa karne se sidhe-sidhe rokna musiibat kaa bhi sabab ban saktaa he
 Therefore, the local people also keep silence
 varanaa ulate, paryatakon kii shikaayat khud unako hi baari pad jaae
 Know the story of a famous painter and government teacher one and a half years ago
 ve hameshaa kii tarah ek paryatak ko kalakritiyaan dikhaane apane ghar le gaye
 He drank tea with his family and then charged him with molestation
 majabuuran unhen uski shikaayat par thane janaa padaa
 The whole locality together saved them
 ab kisi paryatak ko apni kalakritiyaan dikhaane se hi unhone tauba kar lee
 It is not that the case is limited to obscenity and molestation
 videshi yuvatiyaan yahaan ke yuvakon se ankhen chaar or phir pyaar bhi kar rahi hai
 Dinesh Sharma of Bundi of French Bala Viewlet got such a heart that he got married
 abhi 6 may ko hi dharmashala (himachal pradesh) main unhone shaadi kii he
 Here the family has named her Sita
 sita ke saath 'ram' abhi france ke oje shahar main he, jo diwaali par bundi aayega
 How did cultural pollution increase with tourism development? District Tourism Officer Pradyuman Detha says, "the Tourism Department has given the tourists instructions on their website to be modest about their living and dress
 '' vaise bhi paryaton vikaas ke saath saanskrithik pradooshan to hota hi he
 Bundi Additional Superintendent of Police N
 el
 Pawan says that if the tendency towards free sexual behavior and vulgarity is increasing then it is worrisome
 unke shabdon main, ''paryaton vibhaag unhen samajhaae or isse sambandhit prachaar saamagree baante, hordings lagavaaye
 "pawan says that efforts will be made to deal with this social problem by meeting hoteliers for this
 paryaton vikaas ke samanaantar badhati dushpravritiyon par jitani teji se lagaam kasne kaa prayaas kiya jaae, utana hi behatar he
 Indecent pornography can lead to serious incidents, especially in uninhabited places like Bhimalat
 athkheliyon ke pahar*bhimalat jaise ekantayukt jalprapaat sthalon par videshi sailaani jamkar karte hai athkheliyaan
 * Clothes revealing foreign women have proved harmful for them even in remote areas of Rajasthan

 Tyagi said that the party believes that in order to defeat the communal powers and there is no more division in the secular vote, the party will not contest elections this time, but the party has asked the Samajwadi Party and the Congress not to form a grand alliance on the lines of Bihar Held responsible and for this the party was not only surprised but also pained that these two parties in broadening the alliance against BJP Failed tippaniyan It is clear from the party's statement that the party is not happy with its neglect in forming alliances against the BJP, but according to experts, Nitish Kumar had a clear opinion that the role of Samajwadi Party in Bihar elections as the meetings were going on
 Oh, i would avoid that kind of style
 nishchit rup se janata dal united kaa maananaa he ki agar bijepi ko waapas satta main aane se rokna he to uttar pradesh main haar pehali aavashyaktaa he
 Tyagi said that we want the secular party to win, so it is clear that the party has limited its role to the best wishes without naming the Samajwadi Party and Congress at present
 bihar ke chunaav main jeet ke baad nitish kumaar ne uttar pradesh main pichley aath maheenon ke dauraan chah reliyon ko sambodhit kiya tha or uske baad kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki party uttar pradesh main kurmi or kushvaha bahul kshetron main apane ummidavaar khadey karegi
 But surely after Nitish Kumar's move, his power colleagues in Bihar, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress will breathe a sigh of relief
 rajd ne saarvajanik rup se nitish kumaar ko chunaav main ummidavaar na dene kii apil kii thi, lekin samaajawaadee congress ke paksh main prachaar karne kaa anurodh bhi kiya tha, lekin nitish is baat par apni raay se party ke anya netaaon ko avgat kara diya he ki jab uttar pradesh ke bijepi virdohi dalon ne kabhi kisi mudde par unase vichaar-vimarsh nahin kiya tab ekatarfa prachaar tarkahin he
 Nitish will certainly not be happy with his party leaders Sharad Yadav and KC Tyagi, who were given the responsibility of aligning with other parties in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki ajit singh ke saath party ne gathbandhan kiya tha, lekin ab badali hui paristhitiyon main aisa mana ja rahaa he ki pashchim uttar pradesh main jise ajit singh kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he, vahaan janata dal united kaa koi prabhaav nahin he
 In the last assembly elections, Janata Dal United had fielded 219 candidates and not a single one of them could face the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly and most of the candidates lost their deposits
 party ke is vaktavy se saaf he ki bijepi ke khilaaf gathbandhan banane main apni upeksha se party khush nahin he, lekin jaankaron kii maane to jab baithkon kaa daur chal rahaa tha tab nitish kumaar kii spasht raay thi ki samaajawaadee party kii jaisi bhoomika bihar chunaavon main rahi, us tarah ke andaaj se parhez karegi
 Certainly Janata Dal United believes that defeat is the first requirement in Uttar Pradesh if the BJP is to be prevented from coming back to power
 tyaagi ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki dharmanirpeksh party jite, jisase spasht he ki party philhal samaajawaadee party or congress kaa naam liye bina bas shubhakamanaayon tak apane role ko simit rakhaa he
 After winning the Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar addressed six rallies in Uttar Pradesh during the last eight months and after that it was being speculated that the party would field its candidates in Kurmi and Kushwaha dominated areas in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin nishchit rup se nitish kumaar ke is kadam ke baad bihar main unke satta ke sahyogi rashtriya janata dal or congress raahat kii saans lenge
 The RJD had publicly appealed not to give Nitish Kumar a candidate for the election, but also requested to campaign in favor of the Samajwadi Congress, but Nitish has conveyed his opinion to other party leaders Unilateral campaigning is irrational when the anti-bjp parties of Uttar Pradesh have never consulted them on any issue
 nitish nishchit rup se apni party ke netaaon sharad yadav or kasee tyaagi se bhi khush nahin honge jinke upar uttar pradesh main anya partiyon se talmail kaa jimmaa diya tha
 Although the party had aligned with Ajit Singh, it is now believed that under the changed circumstances, Janata Dal United has no influence in western Uttar Pradesh, which is considered to be a strong stronghold of Ajit Singh
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main janata dal united ne 219 umidavaar khadey kiye the or unamem se ek bhi uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha kaa munh nahin dekh paaya tha or adhikansh ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai thi

 Addressing the program, PM Modi said, "in the national interest, we have no hesitation in taking big and tough decisions, because for us the country is above politics
" chaahe sargical hamale hon notebandi ho yaa jiesti, sabhi faisle bina kisi bhay yaa jhijak ke kiye gaye
 Referring to demonetisation, PM Modi said that this step was taken to control black money and it helped identify millions of people who had crores of rupees in their bank accounts, but they never paid income tax
 unhone kaha ki pichley teen maheenon main do lakh se zyada companiyon kaa panjiyan radd kar diya gaya kyonki unke kaledhan ke shodhan main shaamil hone kaa pataa laga tha

 ) Another decision of the administration of Jawaharlal Nehru University has angered the students there
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main mess sambandhi kai charge badhaane kaa notification jari hua he
 Because of this, students there are expressing their displeasure
 notification ke anusaar kai charge main 100 pratishat se lekar 1900 pratishat tak kii badhotaree kii gai he
 In this notification issued on February 27, the mess security (refundable) / mess advance amount has been increased from 2700 to 4500 rupees
 vahiin prati semester lagane vaale ysteblishment charge ko 550 se badhaakar 1100 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Also, the annual charge on the use of utensils etc
 has been increased from Rs
 50 to Rs
 200
 vahiin newspaper ke liye ab students ko 15 rupee kii jagah 50 rupee dene honge
 The maximum increase of 1900 per cent has been made on the delay charged on submission of MMS bills
 ab 1 rupee kii jagah iske liye 20 rupee prati din kii dar se bhugtan karnaa hoga
 At the same time, guest charges related to mess and many other charges related to breakfast, lunch and dinner have also been increased
 pitiai ke anusaar student dean ne is sambandh main koi jawaab nahin diya
 In the notification, this charge will be applicable from 1 January 2018
 pradarshan kii taiyaarisutron ke anusaar mess charge main badhotaree ke khilaaf student mangalvaar dopaher main dean of students ke offis ke baahar pradarshan kar sakate hai
 All the student groups at JNU are denying this increase and are preparing to perform
 roint wing chaatr sanghathan abivipi or left sanghathan donon mangalvaar dopaher main is notification ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan karenge
 According to a student associated with ABVP, this decision taken by the administration is against the interests of the students
 isse chaatro par aarthik boj badhegaa
 Especially for institutions where poor, dalit and tribal students come to study from all over the country, this decision to increase the charge in this way is not right for them
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne sabhi vidhyaarthiyon ke liye 75 fisadi upasthiti aavashyak karne ke faisle par bhi vivaad hua
 The dispute is not yet over that the administration and the students are going to settle down on another decision

 jitne logon par yah study kii gai, unamem se 23 pratishat purushon ne apni partner ko dhokhaa dene kii baat sweekaari
 At the same time, 19 percent of the women admitted that they had cheated their partner
 in mahilaon ne sweekaar kiya ki apane partner ko dhokhaa dene kaa unako dukh to he lekin kisi kii bhaavnaatmak majbootee ke liye aisa karne se ve khud ko roak nahin paatin
 However, if you doubt that your partner is seeking support in someone else these days, then consider these 7 things of his behavior
 inase aapako turant pataa lag jayega kiapake rishte par khatre kii ghanti mandara rahi he
 
 
 She takes the phone to the washroom
 Suddenly she has a lot of love for her phone and takes it with her to the washroom
 uske phone ke password jaldi-jaldi badalte hai or poochne par vah kabhi aapako isaki saaf vajah nahin bataati he
 Not only this, she also uses the phone to save your eyesight
 agar aisa he to us par najar rakhen or rishte ko bachaana chaahate hai to apane bihaviour ko bhi durust kar len
 She does more make-up these days
 When you last asked her to dress well to go to the movie, her answer was that after getting so close what is the need of all this for you
 lekin in dinon vah khud ko sanvaarane main zyada vakt laga rahi he, nai shopping kar rahi he or cosmetics main bhi jarurat zyada kharch kar rahi he to aap thodaa khud ko groum karne par bhi dhyaan den
 Otherwise a handsome contestant will stand in front of you soon
 uski nai dost 'bahut khaas' haiaajkal vah apni ek nai saheli ke bare main zyada baat karti he
 She tells you how much fun and freedom she lives and how happy she is
 agar aapako lagata he ki donon main acchhee dosti he to rukiye
 The truth of it is that she is jealous of her independent life and this feeling has either taken her out of the realm of your control or it is going to happen soon
 iskaa andaja aap uski baton main apni saheli kii tarif kii shiddat se laga sakate hai
 He needs a little space, we all need some time for ourselves
 agar kuch samay tak aapse dur rahane kii vajah ghar kii pareshaani, offis ke tanaav aadi ko bataati he to uski samasya thik he
 But during this time she is not constantly picking up your phone calls, not even answering messages and even emails, so know that she has decided to leave you instead of avoiding you
 PDA ab use pasand nahirishte kii shuruyaat main haath pakad kar ghoomana, ek hi icecream share karnaa, ek plate main khaanaa
 
 
 He loved all this public display of effect
 lekin ab sab usko bachakaana lagata he
 In the message, now you have more formal words than love you, miss you, then understand that someone else has taken your place in his heart
 vah aap par shaq karti herishte mendonon partner main se jo koi bhi galati karata haiyaa saaf kahen ki dhokhaa de rahaa hota he, aksar khud ko sahi sabit karne ke liye duusare par vaise aarope lagaataa he
 If you ask anything like this, if she goes bifurcated and starts accusing you, then understand that there is less and more black in the case
 ain maukey par plan badal detii hyaap donon ne dinar kaa plan banaaya yaa phir coffee shop main milane kaa vaada kiya or aap samay se nikle
 But suddenly he refused to come at the last moment
 ek-do baar to aisa ho saktaa he lekin isse zyada ho or vah bahaane bhi aise de ki subah yoga ke liye jaldi uthanaa he, yaa kaam par janaa he to jaan len ki ab use aapse zyada duusare main dilchaspee he

 com / pasp0nq3lr— ANI (@ani)december 6, 2019 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on a 6-day visit to India at a time when pressure is being put on him to step down as Prime Minister in his own country
 kaha ja rahaa he ki netanyahu apane desh main kaaphi mushkilon main ghire hue hai, or vah bharat main apane lambey daure main kuch bada hasil kar swadesh lautnaa chaahate hai, taaki unke khilaaf bane maahaul main kuch narmi aae or istife tathaa anya tarah ke vivaadon se mukti mil jaae
 Embarrassment due to son An audio tape surfaced before leaving for India tour in which Netanyahu had to feel ashamed of his 26-year-old son Yair Netanyahu
 kuch din pehle aae is tepe main yir ek bade bijnesaman ke bete se ayyashi karne ke liye paisa udhaar maangate sunai die
 He is also heard making a disclosure in it that his Prime Minister's father has made a big deal ($ 20 billion) for the friend's father
 yah tepe 2015 kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 ICREATE, a one-stop shop for money-mentor-market, was kept as Modi's CM
 Politics started in Israel after the foundations
 vahaan ke vipakshi netaa netanyahu se istife kii maang kar rahe hai
 Due to the growing controversy, Netanyahu himself had to give his clarification, apologizing for the son's actions
 unke offis kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki netanyahu kaa us bijnesaman kobi mamone se koi sambandh nahin he or unke bete ke sambandhon ke bare main unhen nahin pataa
 Netanyahu at Bapu's rate, know what was said on the question of making Israel a country
 Gandhiji claimed in an article by the American website, New York Times, that the day the audio tape of Netanyahu's son came out, the Israeli army on the Syrian military bases the same night
 Carried out attacks
 neuyork times kaa daawa he ki aise hamale main pradhanmantri kii sahmati hoti he
 The attack may have been made to stop the growing controversy with the tape of the Prime Minister's son going public
 apane videshi mehmaanon ko gujarat hi kyon le jate hai modi? BJP ne diya ye javababiji netaa, lekin daura 6 din kaado visheshgyon ke israel demokrasi institute ke liye kiye gaye apane shodh ke hawaale se neuyork times ne likhata he israel ke pradhanmantri duniya ke sabase vyast netaaon main se ek hai
 Despite such an addiction, the Israeli Prime Minister has gone out on a six-day visit to India
 yah thodaa samaj se pare hai
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Netanyahu is like any other Israeli Prime Minister who has been accused of corruption
 khud netanyahu par pehle se hi bhrashtachar ke kai aarope lage hai
 According to local media reports, Netanyahu has been accused of illegally taking gifts
 saath hi ek akhbaar se apane paksh main kawarej karne ko lekar sauda karwaane kaa aarope laga hua he
 Another corruption imposed on him is related to warship procurement, in which his close aides are also considered to be suspicious in the case of warship purchase from Germany
 haalanki israeli kanoon ke anusaar, jab tak aaropee court main doshi nahin sabit ho jaataa tab tak use gunaahagaar nahin mana ja saktaa
 On this basis, it is not necessary for the Prime Minister to resign due to allegations
 patni sara par bhi aaropaisrael main bhrashtachar ke aarope kaa saamana karne vaale netanyahu pehle pradhanmantri nahin hai
 Many other Prime Ministers were also accused of corruption and investigation was done in the case
 purv pradhanmantri ehud olfort ko bhrashtachar ke maamle main hi istipha dena padaa baad main unhen jail bhi hui
 Another former PM Ariel Sharon died during an investigation into corruption charges
 haalanki likud party ke netaa netanyahu ke saath dikkat yah he ki apane kareebi parijanon par bhi bhrashtachar ke aarope lage yaa phir vivaadon main ghire hai
 Son Yair has just come into controversy, but his wife Sarah Netanyahu has an old relationship with controversies
 sara par sarkari khajaane ke durupyog kaa aarope he
 Netanyahu's India tour will end in two days
 jab vah swadesh lautate hai to dekhnaa hoga ki unke desh main unki raajnneeti kaa kya bhavishya hota he
 They will have to leave the post or they will fight their innocence case in court

 You become a rioter by misinformation like you saw how people in Agastyamuni in Uttarakhand turned into a riot due to misinformation and shops were burnt
 agar unhone soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat sahi jaanane kaa daawa kiya hota, koshish kii hoti to ve apradhi banane se batch sakate the or kisi kii dukaane nahin jalatin
 The problem is that the information market is filled with rumors and fake news
 sanvaidhanik padon par baithe netaa jhooth bolkar soochna jaise pavitra tatv ko pradooshit kar rahe hai
 Every kind of information is suspicious
 is bich ek kanoon he soochna ke adhikaar kaa kanoon
 Use of which changes you
 aapke puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main prashasan ke bheetar halchal paidaa hoti he, kuch galat baahar aa jaataa he or aap sirf ek prayaas se loktantr main paharedaar ban jate hai
 The entire model of right to information is based on the fact that you become the janitor of democracy and not one
 hazaron prakaar kii sansthaaon kii nigaraanee koi ek chaukeedaar se nahin ho sakati he, yah model fail hone ke liye baadhya he

 If there is a lapse from an institution, then some Nirav Mod escapes
 jis bazaar se yani news channelon or akhbaaron se aap soochna karidate hai, usase milane vaali soochna eemaandaar or vishwasaneey he yaa nahin, ise lekar satark rahaa kiijie or jin sarkari sansthaanon se aap adhikaar ke tahat soochna maang sakate hai, use bhi lekar satark rahiye

 When there is a lie around and there is no trust of the press, the right to information is the last right to know

 Only by right to information can you know right

 There is a large number of Meghwal who is a Dalit caste, to prevent someone from becoming a sarpanch, someone from two to four house Khatik society is searched
 pyaar ji surat main mitti kaa tel bech rahe the, vahaan se bulaayaa jaataa he ki ham tumhen sarpanch banaaenge
 They come and win the election of sarpanch and play in the hands of the Thakur caste
 jaldi hi pyaar ji samaj jate hai ki unase galat karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Those workers come to the Kisan Shakti Sangathan and say that there should be a public hearing in our village
 ek sarpanch apane hi khilaaf jansunwaayee kii maang karata he
 So that it can be free from it
 kai baar aap khud se mukt nahin ho pate hai, to dusron kii madad lete hai
 The entire game goes through which is re-examined
 ye he sahi soochna kaa asar
 Otherwise, upper caste people were taking advantage of government schemes by adding their names to the list of BPL families in their village
 jinke liye yojana thi unhen to mil hi nahin rahi thi
 This book is full of such incidents
 is bich ek kanoon he soochna ke adhikaar kaa kanoon
 Use of which changes you
 aapke puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main prashasan ke bheetar halchal paidaa hoti he, kuch galat baahar aa jaataa he or aap sirf ek prayaas se loktantr main paharedaar ban jate hai
 The entire model of right to information is based on the fact that you become the janitor of democracy and not one
 hazaron prakaar kii sansthaaon kii nigaraanee koi ek chaukeedaar se nahin ho sakati he, yah model fail hone ke liye baadhya he
 It is a throwback

 The Right to Information Act in India was passed on 15 June 2005

 That experience journey has been compiled in a book
 'THE RTI Story', ise likhaa he aruna roy ne magar ve isaki akeli lekhika nahin hai
 There are probably thousands of people who stood up in the sunlight for weeks, took part in public hearings and understood the importance of information, they are all writing this book or their story is being written in this book
 sarkaar se soochna maangi ja sakati he, ye khyaal hi nayaa tha

 In this phase of fake news, when a large part of the media has become dock and slave media, what would happen if you did not have the right to information law

 If this was not the law, then where would you have brought the information to test the government's claims, to prove right or wrong
 andhera kitna ghanaa hota
 By stealing your own data, a system of serving you lies has developed
 artiai ek diye ke samaan he, kam se kam aap jaankaree maang kar dekh to sakate hai ki andhera kitna ghanaa he
 How much is false and how much is true
 kya soochna kaa adhikaar phek news se bachaa saktaa he
 When there is a lie around and there is no trust of the press, the right to information is the last right to know
 aap paise dekar sahi soochna kharid sakate hai, yah bhram ab tut gaya he
 In India as well as in the world

 Everyone is using this law in their own way

 inke jivan kii yatra kai logon kii yatra main badal jaati he
 Hindustan gets a revolutionary law, the right to information law
 soochna se las ek aisi janata kii kalpana karne vaala kanoon jiske bare main abhi tak sochaa nahin gaya tha
 Anyone of our audience who has ever used the right to information in life is also the author and the reader of this book
 ve bhi iske lekhak hai jo soochna ke adhikaar kaa istamaal karan ke kaaran maar die gaye hai
 They are martyrs of information
 aap jaanate hai ki main jab kitaab kaa naam letaa hum, daam bhi bataata hum or prakaashak kaa naam bhi bataata hum
 It is printed by Rolly Books Publishing and the price is Rs 495
 yah kitaab angrezi main he or jaldi hi raajakmal prakaashan se hindi main aa rahi he
 Move away from this book for a minute and consider a question
 phek news ke is daur main jab media kaa bada hissaa godi or ghulaam media ho gaya he, agar aapke paas soochna ke adhikaar kaa kanoon nahin hota to kya hota
 Please consider this question seriously
 agar yah kanoon nahin hota, tab aap sarkaar ke daavon ko parakhane ke liye, sahi yaa galat sabit karne ke liye kahaan se soochna laate
 How dense the darkness would have been
 aapkaa hi data chura kar, aapako jhooth parosane kaa ek tantra viksit ho gaya he
 RTI is like a lamp, at least you can see how dense the darkness is by seeking information
 jhooth kitna he or sach kitna he
 Can the right to information be protected from fake news? jab chaaron taraf jhooth ho or press kaa bhi bharosa na ho, soochna kaa adhikaar aakhri adhikaar he, jaanane kaa
 You can buy the right information by paying money, this confusion is now broken
 bharat main bhi or duniya main bhi
 i do not know whether people associated with this law had imagined this day in their struggle journey, but as much as i have been able to read this book, it seemed that governments are a bundle of lies
 soochna ke adhikaar se hi aap sahi jaan sakate hai
 It is a law that also empowers the officers sitting inside, who are honest, and for the harassed employees, this is also the support
 har koi is kanoon kaa apane apane hisaab se istamaal kar rahaa he
 The comments is kitaab ko padhate hue aap jaan paaenge ki kaise sara khel sahi soochna kaa he
 You do not get the information of government records, we are all being crushed under this trick
 pyarji ek sarpanch kaa kissa he isamen
 When the seat of the panchayat was reserved, influential castes formed a strategy
 vahaan meghavaal jo ek dalit jati he, uski sankhya zyaada he, uske kisi ko sarpanch banane se rokane ke liye do chaar ghar vaale khatic samaaj ke kisi kii khoj hoti he
 Prem ji was selling kerosene in Surat, from there it is said that we will make you a sarpanch
 ve aate hai or sarpanch kaa chunaav jeet jate hai or thakur jati ke haath main khilne lagate hai
 Soon, Prem ji understands that he is being mistaken
 ve mazdoor kisaan shakti sanghathan ke paas aate hai or kehete hai ki hamaare gaanv main jansunwaayee ho
 a sarpanch demands public hearing against himself
 taaki wo isse mukt ho sake
 Many times you are not able to get rid of yourself, then seek the help of others
 sara khel saamne jaataa he jo phir se jaanch hoti he
 This is the effect of correct information
 varna to unke gaanv main bipiel pariwaron kii suchi main oonchi jati ke log apana naam jod kar sarkari yojanaon kaa laabh le rahe the
 Those who had plans were not getting it
 aise prasangon se yah kitaab bhari hui he

 Although many people of Hindi literature may object to calling the agnay a story-maker, but the fact is that the agnay retained its authority in every genre of word-creation including fiction
 agyeya kii kahaniyon kaa falak itnaa vishaal, samay or kaal se pare he ki aap unhen andekha nahin kar sakate
 
 
 However, he remained famous as a poet
 agyeya ne kalantar main kahani likhnaa kam kar diya tha, par jo kuch bhi likhaa utane main hi unke kathanak, paatr or pathak hameshaa jeevant rahe
 The reason was the content
 agyeya apni kahaniyon main darshan or kathanak ko shabd kaushal se vah rup dete ki pathak chamatkrit rah jaataa
 Behind this was his untrammeled study and vivid life experience
 The compilation of the book 'abandoned Rasta' - Volume: At the end of the role of one and two, Agyeya himself wrote, "my stories presented are twenty years old or more; these twenty years are the genre
 It would have been surprising if it had not progressed further
 main kahani likhata kahin rahaa par satark pathak ke naate dekhtaa-samajhataa rahaa hoon ki kahani kii pragati kidar he or uske prerak kaaran kya hai
 Now if i ever write stories then they will definitely be different from these stories and that variation will be true, and it will not be necessary to say that these stories are new in some new sense, because they must have originated from the development of the genre
 par sambhavy apni jagah par rahe; ve kahaniyaan jahaan thim vahiin rakhkar padhi jaaen

 Who does not misunderstand this! So today literature on the birth anniversary of the unborn is a classic story for the readers of Aaj Tak: shatru-ignorance, while sleeping one night, God appeared in a dream and said, 'knowledge, i have sent you into the world by making you my representative 
 utho, sansar kaa punarnirmaan karo
 'knowledge awoke
 usne dekha, sansar andhkaar main padaa he
 And mankind continues to move towards destruction in that darkness by being corrupted
 vah ishwar kaa pratinidhi he, to use maanav-jati ko path par laana hoga, andhkaar se baahar kheenchna hoga, uskaa netaa banakar uske shatru se yuddh karnaa hoga
 And he went and stood at the crossroads and told everyone, "I am Christ, i am a prophet, i am the representative of God
" mere paas tumhaare uddhaar ke liye ek sandesh he!lekin kisi ne uski baat nahin suni
 Some look at him and laugh, some say, is crazy; Most say, it teaches against our religion, is an atheist, kill it! And the children used to stone him
 akhir tang aakar vah ek andheri gali main chhipakar baith gaya, or sochane laga
 He decided that religion is the greatest enemy of mankind, he will have to fight it
 tabhi paas kahin se usne stri ke karun krandan kii awaz suni
 He saw a woman lying on the ground, she had a small child, who was either unconscious, or dead, because there was no movement in her body
 gyaan ne poocha, 'bahin, kyon roti ho?'us stri ne kaha, 'maine ek vidharmee se vivaah kiya tha
 When people came to know of this, they killed him and fired me
 meraa baccha bhi bhukh se mar rahaa he
 Knowledge became firm and firm
 usne kaha, 'tum mere saath aao, main tumhaari raksha karunga
 'and took her with him
 gyaan ne dharm ke viruddh prachaar karnaa shuru kiya
 He said, 'religion is a false bond
 paramatma ek he, abaadh he, or dharm se pare he
 Religion keeps us in range, stops us, separates us from God, so is our enemy
 'lekin kisi ne kaha, 'jo vyakti paraayi or bahishkrut aurat ko apane paas rakhata he, uski baat ham kyon sunen! vah samaaj se patit he, neech he
 'then people kicked him out of society
 gyaan ne dekha ki dharm se ladane se pehle samaaj se ladanaa he
 Until society is conquered, religion cannot be denied
 tab vah isi prakaar kaa prachaar karne laga
 He started saying, 'this Dharmadhvaji, this ponge-purohit-mullah, who is this? What right do they have to keep our lives tied? Come, let us overcome them, create an independent society, so that we can grow on the path of progress
 'tab ek din videshi sarkaar ke do sipaahi aakar use pakad le gayi, kyonki vah virgon main paraspar virodh jagaa rahaa tha

 And he secretly organized a fight against foreigners
 ek din uske paas ek videshi aadmi aayaa
 He was dressed in dirty, torn, torn, ghastly clothes
 mukh par jhuriyaan padi thim, aankhon main ek tikhaa dard tha
 He told knowledge, 'you give me some work so that i can earn a living
 main videshi hoon, aapke desh main bhookha mar rahaa hoon
 Any work you give me, i will do it
 aap pariksha len
 i do not even have a slice of bread
 'gyaan ne khinn hokar kaha, 'meri dasha tumse kuch acchhee nahin he, main bhi bhookha hoon
 'that foreigner suddenly melted
 bolaa, 'acha! main aapke dukh se bahut dukhi hoon
 Consider me your brother yadi aapas main sahanubhuti ho, to bhukhe maranaa maamuli baat he
 May God protect you

 The first enemy is hunger
 pehle bhukh ko jeetna hoga, tabhi aage kuch sochaa ja sakegaa
 
 
 And he started forming a team of hungry boys, whose aim was to snatch money from the rich and distribute it equally among all, give bread to the hungry, etc
; But when the Dhanikas came to know about this, then one day they silently got hold of him by their variables and imprisoned them in a hill fort
 vahaan ekaant main use sataane ke liye nity ek mutthi chabaina or ek lotaa pani de dete, bas
 Slowly, the heart of knowledge began to fill with guilt
 jivan use boj jaan padane laga
 i would constantly wake up to the feeling that I, the representative of knowledge, God, is so compelled that the provision of bread and bread is impossible for me! If this is so, how wasteful this life is, how much touch, how meaningless! One day he climbed the fort wall
 baahar khai main bharaa hua pani dekhte-dekhte use ekadam se vichaar aayaa or usne nishchay kar liya ki vah usamen kud kar praan kho degaa
 Returning to God, he will pray to release me from this burden; i am your representative, but i do not have a place in such a world
 vah sthir, mugdh drushti se khai ke pani main dekhne laga
 He was about to jump that he suddenly saw, his reflection in the water and it was as if he was saying, "enough, you fought yourself?" Gyan paused, then slowly came down from the wall and the fort

 That is, if a film gets 100 crores in the first week, then the producers share is half of it
 lekin jaise-jaise hafte bitate jate hai vaise-vaise collection se producers yaa distributors kaa hissaa kam hota jaataa he
 This arithmetic of the Bharat Im Collection started after the arrival of the multiplex
 isliye nirmaataa chaahate hai ki film pehle hafte main hi zyada se zyada kamai kar le
 So that they get more profit and that is why the film is heavily promoted

 unhone kaha ki kai jagahon par baton se yah saaf hua he ki kumaar vishwaas ne congress ke netaaon par nijee hamale ke liye to hami bhari lekin bijepi ke netaaon par nahin
 He said that people have respect for our party because we have attacked the corruption of both BJP and Congress

 ) kisaanon or vipaksh ke gusse or virodh ke baavjood aakhirkaarasanshodhit bhoomi adhigrahan billloksabhaa main paas ho hi gaya
 But the government has made some more amendments in this amendment as well
 kuch khaas bandishon ko hataa diya gaya he
 Increasing opposition to the amendment is believed to be a major reason
 haalanki abhi bhi bill main kai aise pench hai jin par sarkaar ne kisi kii nahin suni
 Know the amended bill passed in the Land Acquisition Bill, the five main amendments made in it - 01
 kheti yogya jameen daayre main nahimodi sarkaar ne pehle sanshodhan main kheti yogya bhoomi ko adhigrahit karne kaa bhi prastaav shaamil kiya tha
 But now the bill brought in the Lok Sabha has been amended
 ab bahufasali bhoomi kaa adhigrahan nahin kiya jayega
 Also, it has been decided to take limited land for the industrial corridor
 isse kisaanon ke ek bade varg ko raahat milegi
 02
 manjuuri jaruribhumi adhigrahan kanoon 2013 ke mutabik adhigrahan ke liye 80 fisadi kisaanon kii manjuuri kaa praavdhaan tha
 It was abolished by the Modi government in a new amendment, but now according to the bill passed in the Lok Sabha, the approval of the farmers will also be necessary in the acquisition for the social infrastructure project
 isi tarah se adivasee kshetron main adhigrahan ke liye panchayat kii sahmati jaruri hogi
 03
 apil kaa adhikarmodi sarkaar ne 2013 ke bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main shaamil apil ke adhikaar ko khatm kar diya tha
 But now after the amendment bill, the right of appeal has been returned to the farmers
 ab ve adhigrahan ke kisi bhi maamle main apil kar sakenge
 This will strengthen the protection of their rights
 04
 The first land acquisition law, there was a provision to give compensation to the affected farmers, but no one was given a job
 sanshodhan ke baad loksabhaa main paas hue bill main prabhavit parivaar ke kisi ek sadsy ko naukari die jane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 05
 industrial coridor ke liye adhigrahabhoomi adhigrahan bill main shaamil kiye gaye ek praavdhaan se railway treks or hive ke ek kilometre daayre main rahane waalon ko pareshaani ho sakati he
 The government has decided that up to one kilometer of land can be acquired on either side of the railway track and highway for the industrial corridor
 sanshodhit bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke mutabik banjar jameenon ke liye alag se record rakhaa jayega
 This amended bill needs to be enacted by April 4, otherwise the ordinance will be repealed
 ab rajyasabha main vipaksh ne agar bill kaa virodh jari rakhaa to sarkaar ko sanyukt satr bulaanaa hoga
 And because of the majority there, the government will easily do its work
 udhar, kisaan sanghathan dilli main hone vaali kisaan panchayat kii taiyaari main jute hai
 The government will deal with the opposition in Parliament but it will not be easy to deal with the farmers

 pakistan main fouj or civil sarkaar ke bich tanaav ek baar phir khulkar saamne aa gaya he
 After Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accepted Pakistan's role in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack, senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (nawaz) Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, while agreeing on it, also revealed the army's conspiracy in his country
 hashmi ke is khulaase se yah saaf ho gaya he kipakistani faujakis tarah civil hukmaranon ko kathputli kii tarah istemaal karti he
 Pakistan has been a three-time minister in the government and this revelation of Hashmi, considered among the senior most leaders of the country, has once again exposed Pakistan and its army to the whole world
 unhone kaha ki fouj paak main hameshaa se loktantr ke khilaaf rahi he or use kabhi bhi sthir nahin hone diya
 Governments have been declining
 In a press conference in Fauzmultan, Hashmi said that while opening the poll of Pakistani military and generals, Pakistani army has always been toppling elected governments
 fouj par aarope lagaate hue javed hashmi ne kaha, 'main is baat kaa gavaah hum ki pichley 5 saal se fouj navaj sharif kii sarkaar ko giraane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Javed Hashmi, senior leader of the Muslim League, while giving a direct warning to the army, said, "A time will come when you will join hands and no one will want to come to the rule
" pakistan kii kaum jaag uthi he
 Now you have to face trouble
 'fouj kii bhoomika par sawalarmi chif par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha, 'janaab asakari kayaadat sahab, punjab se aawaaj uthegi, baluchistan se uth rahi he, capike se uthegi
 Will arise from Karachi and Sindh, tomorrow if not today
 aap thali main rakhkar vajeer kaa pad denge to bhi koi sweekaar nahin karegaa
 One day, your own people will tell you not to go to Multan Cant wearing a uniform
 'javed hashmi ne fouj se sawaal kiya ki aakhir pakistan kii fouj kii pakistan ke nirmaan main kya bhoomika rahi he? unhone kaha ki pakistan kii fouj ko galatfahami he ki pakistan army pakistan kii maa he
 The truth is that he is not the owner of the country
 bharat se har jang haara pakyahi nahin, javed hashmi ne pakistan fouj kii kshamta par bhi sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki faujee generalon ke kharaab ranneeti kii vajah se pakistan kobharatase 5 jangon main shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 According to Javed Hashmi, '80 per cent of the army generals have written in their books that Pakistan started all the 5 wars and all of them had to defeat India
 pakistan ke purv mantri hashmi ne paak kii fouj ko bhrashtachar main bhi lipt bataaya
 He claimed that former Pakistan Chief of Army Staff Rahil Sharif and General Kayani had several plots and when the current Army Chief left, his land would also be revealed
 musharraf par bane deshadroh kaa maamalamumbai hamale paranvaj sharifke bayaan kaa samarthan karte hue pakistan ke purv mantri javed hashmi ne daawa kiya ki navaj ne jo bhi kaha, wo sach kaha he
 And if a case of treason is to be filed against him, then a case should be registered against the former President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf
 unhone kaha ki aaj pakistan ek aatanki desh ban chukaa he or iske liye fouj hi purnroop se jimmedaar he
 Javed Hashmi, 70, has been a member of the National Assembly four times and was the party president of 'PML-N' and Imran Khan's party 'PTI'
 hashmi navaj sarkaar main swasthy mantralay (farvari, 1997-oktober 1999) or khel evam yuva mantralay (1978-79 or may 1993-july 1993) sambhaal chuke hai

 raghuram rajan se kiya gaya tha samparkkuch samay pehle aarthik visheshgy or rigerv bank of india ke purv governor raghuram rajan se sampark jarur kiya gaya, lekin unhone inkaar kar diya
 Now it will be decided in the meeting of PAC that only someone from the party will go to Rajya Sabha or any non-political person should be given a chance

 These are the key contenders, Kumar Vishwas, who has openly targeted the party leadership, has already made his claim to the Rajya Sabha, but his pull from the Kejriwal team and the Cold War are also well known
 aise main kumaar vishwaas ke rajyasabha jane par philhal talwaar lataki hui he
 Interestingly, the names of Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh in the party may also come up for discussion

 Those night shoots full of intense action, ofcourse were peppered with some fun banter and laughs in between shots amongst the boys, where our director @adityadharfilms would also join us
 All of this feels worth it, with the generous love the Film is getting from you all
