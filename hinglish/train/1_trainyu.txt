 khatarnaak don se vidhayak ban chuke anant singh ne yah sabak mushkil se hi sahi lekin sikh liya lagata he ki physics kaa yah niyam jivan main bhi lagu hota he, khaskar nasamajhi bhare kaamon kii pratikriya ke rup main
 However, it is also true that many times the forces that create equilibrium take some time to come to the surface
 bihar kii raajnneeti ke kukhyat babali ke rup main pahachaane jate rahe 52 varshiya jedy (you) vidhayak ko is hafte patna ke posh patliputra colony sthit apane hotel ke saamne kii us khaali jameen ko chhodia padaa, jis par unhone kathith taur par atikaraman karne kii koshish kii thi
 Interestingly, Anant Singh, who created terror from his domineering image and forced people to bow down, was forced to retreat due to Parveen Amanullah, one of his party's mlas and Social Welfare Minister
 hotel ke adhikariyon ne bacchon ke khel ke liye istemaal kii ja rahi pich or bujurgon kii saiyr ke liye istemaal hone vaali jagah kii gheraabandi kar lee thi
 The enclosed space was temporarily being used for hotel parking, but if Amanullah had not come forward in time and raised the issue and opposed the encroachment, the place would have been merged with the hotel
 It was suspected amanulla bataati hai, ''unhone to vahaan ek diwaar banani bhi shuru kar di thi
 "anant Singh's Buddha Heritage Hotel, spread over 10,000 sqft in a very posh Pataliputra area (which is around 8 crores)
 kaa hoga) haal hi main chaalu hua he
 As per the rules of Pataliputra Society, no commercial activity can be conducted in this area
 lekin kisi main yah himmat nahin thi ki vah is maamle main anant singh se sawaal karata
 Strong drama was seen here in the last one week
 or iskaa nateeja jedy (you) ke do netaaon main takaraav ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Eventually, due to the increasing pressure, Anant Singh agreed to leave the place
 haalanki, artiai activist se mantri baniin parveen amanulla ke liye yah sab itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Initially, when Amanullah asked the hotel management to remove the encroachment, Anant Singh rejected his remarks, even denying that he had committed any encroachment

 Now it was the turn of Amanulla's big initiative
 ve bina kisi suraksha ke anant singh ke hotel ke saamne ja pahunchin or hotel ke adhikariyon ko turant atikaraman hataane ke nirdesh die
 On Wednesday, the hotel management was seen placing collapsed boundary walls in a mini van and removing them from there
 anant singh ke khilaaf atikaraman virdohi abhiyaan kii amanulla kii safalataa kaa asar kahin bahut aage tak hoga kyonki isane puure samaaj ko jagaakar yah yakeen dilaa diya he ki bahubaliyon ko chunauti di ja sakati he or unhen niyamon ke paalan ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that in the last few years, Anant Singh's wealth has increased manifold
 2005 main unhone apane chunavi halafname main 3
 40 lakhs
 kii maamuli sampatti hone kii ghoshnaa kii thi jo 2010 main badhkar 38

 nitish kumaar ke acchhee sarkaar ke model ke thik ulat singh apane ilaake main samanaantar sarkaar chalaane ke liye kukhyat hai
 It is equally true that the government has rarely tried to curb them
 janvari, 2008 main jab hatya ke ek maamle main peedit parivaar ne aarope lagaaya ki is aparaadh kii sajeesh anant singh ne rachi he, tab bhi bihar police ne unhen giraftaar karnaa pasand nahin kiya
 Singh was last arrested in November 2007, when he beaten a TV journalist
 haalanki, 10 din ke andar hi ve nyaayik hiraasat se baahar aa gaye the
 The legislator, who has been known for his craze like growing a dragon, has been caught in many controversies earlier
 masalan, duusare kii marcides kaa manamaane dhang se dabaavpurvak istemaal karnaa yaa phir 2004 main ek kaarykram ke dauraan hawaii firing karnaa
 In the election affidavit, Singh describes himself as educated

 Yet no one is going to challenge the JD (U) and their influence in the government

 Now talk of Amanullah

 Amanullah, daughter of former MP and diplomat Syed Shahabuddin and a minister in the state government, says with confidence, "I cannot be intimidated

 "his colleagues in the government should take some inspiration from him so that the environment of Bihar can get better

 Till now, the groom brings a procession on a horse or a bike
 yaa phir duulhaa car main baithkar dulhan ke ghar aata he
 But there was a procession in West Bengal which everyone was surprised to see
 kyonki is baraat main duulhaa road roller par baithkar aayaa
 Yes, on the road roller from which the roads are made
 yah baraat pashchim bengal ke shahar nadia main ai
 Where the bride and groom wanted to make their marriage 'wild'
 isliye aam taur par ghode yaa bike par nahin balki kuch alag road roller par duulhaa apni hone vaali dulhaniyaan lene pahunchaa
 Anyone who saw this procession could not live without being captured in the camera
 ji haa, road roller ko achche se phool or liten lagaakar sajaayaa gaya
 The wrists were hung on him and the groom sat with the driver
 itnaa hi nahin road roller ke upar front par apana or hone vaali patni kaa naam likhvaya
 The groom Arka Patra says that he only wanted to make his marriage special
 ghodi yaa car main entry bahut puraani ho chuki he, isliye vah road roller par baithkar aayaa
 He further told that he wanted to come to his wedding in a vintage car, but got the road roller
 yah mujhe bahut sasta padaa
 At the same time, the bride Arundhati Tarafdar says that her future husband is very impressed with this entry
 koi baccha aapse bheekh maange, vah bhi sirf ek rupee kii to aap bhi uske saath aisa saluk nahin karenge jaisaa madhya pradesh kii mantri ne kiya
 State Animal Husbandry Minister Kusum Mehdele kicked off a begging of an innocent on Sunday demanding a rupee

 The incident took place at the bus stand, embarrassing all the spectacle that has been seen as a silent spectator
 mehdele vahaan rajya ke sthapana diwas par swatchta abhiyaan ke tahat safai kaary main hissaa lene pahunchi thim
 At the end of the program, she was moving towards her car, when a child about 10 years came begging for a rupee and put her head in front of their feet
 baccha mantri ke pairon ke saamne apana sir rakhkar lagaataar rupaya maange ja rahaa tha
 The minister got angry at this and he kicked her on the head
 yah dekhakar vahaan maujuud sabhi log sakate main aa gaye, magar kisi main kuch bhi kehane kaa saahas nahin hua
 The officers present there pulled the child back
 video viral, baikfoot par bijepimantri ke bachche ko laat maarane kaa video viral ho gaya
 After this, the politics of the state also boiled over
 congress sarkaar par hamale kar rahi he, vahiin sattadhari dal bachaav kii mudra main he
 Hitesh Vajpayee of BJP refused to say anything about this
 bahaanaa banaaya ki unhone video nahin dekha he
 Something can be said about this after watching the video
 congress pravaktaa ke
 K
 mishra ne kaha ki aisi mantri ko ek minute bhi pad par rahane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The farmers had also given absurd statements on suicide, before this, Mehdele has also made absurd statements on farmers' suicide
 pichley dinon unhone damoh jile main kaha tha ki koi kisaan jawan bete kii maut par aatmahatya nahin karata to fasal ke kharaab hone par koi kaise khudakushi kar saktaa he, jabaki jawan bete kii maut kaa dukh kaaphi bada hota he
 The politics of reservation in the upper caste reservation, Dodhari Talwar country is very deep and it is tried before every election
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne chunaav se ain pehle aarthik rup se pichde savarnon ko sarkari naukariyon main 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa faisla lekar aarakshan kii raajnneeti ko phir garma diya he
 After the defeat in the state elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) felt that due to the strong support of the Dalit Atrocities Act, its upper caste vote bank was being shifted
 madhya pradesh main to savarnon ke sanghathan saamaanya, pichhadavarg alpsankhyak kalyaan samaaj (sapaks) ne shivaraj singh chouhan ke ye kehane ke baad ki koi maai kaa laal aarakshan khatm nahin kar saktaa, joardaar andolan chalaaya
 However, the SPX could not become a political power even after taking down its candidates
 modi sarkaar kaa ye faisla chunaav main savarnon kii naaraazgi kam karne kaa prayaas lagata he
 The previous UPA government had also adopted the criterion of reservation before the election when it gave the minorities 4
 5 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa elaan kiya tha lekin vah faisla adaalat main nahin tik sakaa
 The main reason for not getting tick in the court is the lack of solid data and fresh survey
 darasal, jati aadhaarit janaganana ke aankade sarkaar ke paas hai to par usne inhen saarvajanik nahin kiya he
 In order to measure backwardness, a survey of castes has to be done which is not done in the country
 abhi desh main anusuchit jati (essi) or anusuchit janajati (asti) or anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) ko milakar 49
 There is a 5 percent reservation
 supreme court 1992 ke indira saahani ke apane faisle main saaf kar chukaa he ki kul aarakshan 50 fisadi se zyada nahin ho saktaa
 Doing so goes against the right to equality
 iske baavjood kuch rajyon jaise tamilnadu main aarakshan is seemaa se zyada he jiskaa cese supreme court main chal rahaa he
 It is true that the poor upper castes also need government help, just like other castes are getting
 lekin inkaa bhi koi survey nahin hua he, jo iske bhavishya par sawalia nishaan lagaataa he
 From the political point of view, the reservation announced for the poor upper castes is an attempt to dispel the resentment of this class
 is par sarkaar samvidhan sanshodhan prastaav laane ja rahi he jise paarit karana uske liye aasaan nahin hoga
 The Constitution does not say about reservation on economic grounds
 or aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan karnaa jaruri hoga
 With the stance of the parties on this proposal, the BJP will edge its strategy in the election field
 vah isi aadhaar par hamalavar hona chaahegi
 This decision has come at a time when opposing it will not be beneficial for any party, but the opposition will not allow it to climb even further
 sire na chadhane dene main hi shaayad bhaajapa apana phayda dekhegi jab vah prastaav ko latakaane vaale vipakshi dalon ko savarna virdohi kah kar badnaam kare
 Even anti-upper caste people would not like to take anti-bjp parties
 isliye ve prastaav main koi badi khot nikaalane kaa prayaas karengi
 Reservation is a double-edged sword, its advantages and disadvantages are both deep
 basapa supremeo mayawati ne aarakshan par ekatarfa raajnneeti kii lekin apni sweekaaryata kaa dayera apane vot bank se baahar nahin le ja sakin
 During the UPA era, the Congress tried to identify itself as the Messiah of Muslims, but lost power in this round
 bihar chunaav ke dauraan sangh pramukh kaa aarakshan kaa bayaan bhaajapa virdohi partiyon ke liye hathiyaar ban gaya tha
 Announcement of reservation to upper castes may also create resentment among other castes and classes
 lekin garib savarnon ko aarakshan par chunavi ghamaasan machana tay he or jo jitna mukhar hoga uske liye jokhim bhi utana zyada hoga

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has taken a dig at Congress President Rahul Gandhi's speech in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh
 is dauraan bijepi netaa jetali ne rahul gandhi kii samaj par sawaal uthaae
 He has asked the question to Rahul Gandhi, how much does he know? When will they understand things? Earlier, when the farmers reached Mandsaur on the anniversary of the firing, Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government of the Center and the Shivraj Singh government of the state fiercely
 pichley saal mandsaur main police kii firing main chah kisaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 Addressing the 'kisan Samriddhi Sankalp Rally' of the Congress in Mandsaur, Gandhi said that the debt of farmers will be forgiven within 10 days of the day the Congress government comes to Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle rahul gandhi kaa yah daura behad ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Many big leaders including Kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia of Madhya Pradesh Congress were present in this rally
 udhar, congress adhyaksh kii raily ke baad kendriya vittamantri arun jetali ne fasebuk post kar palatwaar kiya
 He questioned the wisdom and understanding of Rahul Gandhi
 jetali ne likhaa he, ‘madhya pradesh main die gaye rahul gandhi ke bhaashan ko sunne ke baad is sawaal ke jawaab ko lekar meri jigyaasa or bad gai
 Is he given insufficient information or is he too liberal about his facts? ’ is dauraan unhone rahul gandhi dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon kii khamiyaan bhi ginai
 2 of 15 top industrialists on PM Modi
 5 lakh karod rupee ke karj ko maaf karne ke rahul gandhi ke aarope ke jawaab main jetali ne kaha, 'congress adhyaksh kii yah baat tathyaatmak rup se puri tarah galat he
 The Modi government has not waived even a rupee loan of industrialists
 jetali ne kaha, 'jin logon ke upar bainkon or anya vittiya sansthaanon kaa bakaayaa he, unhen diwalia ghoshit kiya gaya or unhen ibisi ke jariye unki company se bedakhal kiya gaya he
 This law was implemented by the Modi government
 inamen jyadatar karj upie shashan ke dauraan die gaye
 'rahul Gandhi alleged that the Modi government does not have money to give loans to farmers, while industrialists are being given a lot of loan
 is par jetali ne kaha ki yah baat tathyaatmak rup se galat he
 He said that loans were given to industrialists in large numbers during the UPA regime, which have become npas today
 iskaa bada hissaa bainkon dwaara 2008-14 main diya gaya
 At the same time, the Modi government has taken steps to recover these money
 rahul gandhi ne aarope lagaaya ki piem modi ne do hira kaarobaariyon ko 35-35 hajaar karod rupee die, jo ab desh chhodkar chale gaye
 Jaitley retorted, saying that it was factually incorrect
 bank dhokhadhadi saal 2011 main shuru hui
 The UPA was ruled at that time
 is dhokhadhadi kaa pataa endie sarkaar ke aane ke baad laga
 Congress told Jaitley, reversing the sarcasm of agrarian ignorance, Congress party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that the crisis in villages, farm sector debt, farmer suicides and yield were sold below the minimum support price in the Narendra Modi government
 a new trend has been created
 unhone kaha, ‘bina vibhaag ke mantri arun jetali krishi se anbhigya hai, lekin aaj desh ko gyaan de rahe hai
 Surjewala said that the Modi government has become an NPA for the country
 modi sarkaar main krishi vikaas dar 1
 9 per cent, while in the UPA government it is 4
 2 fisadi thi
 He claimed that the foundation of the anti-farmer BJP has been shaken by Rahul Gandhi's Kisan rally in Mandsaur
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne congress par kiya palatwarrahul gandhi ke hamale se bifere madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki pehle rahul gandhi ko yah jawaab dena chahie ki congress ne itane varshon tak shashan kiya, lekin kisaanon ko abhi tak sinchai ke liye pani tak nahin mil rahaa he
 Today, the Congress, which gives loans to farmers at 18 per cent interest, is questioning the BJP
 jabaki bijepi ne kisaanon ko jiro fisadi byaaj main lone dene kaa faisla liya he
 Chauhan said that in the era of Congress, sticks were used for fertilizer
 or ye goli kii baat karte hai, to ye bataaen ki jab mulatai main goli chali thi, to mukhyamantri koun the? unhone kaha ki betul jile ke mulatai main 21 se zyada kisaanon kii maut hui thi
 First Congress should give its account

 Amitabh Bachchan is going to get the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the biggest award in the film industry
 unhen is aword se sammanit kiya jaaenga
 Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar has given this information by tweeting
 jaavdekar ne twit kar likhaa, 'lijend amitabh bachchan, jinhone do pidiyon tak hamaara manoranjan kiya, hamen prerana di, unhen ek mat se dadasahab phalke puraskaar ke liye chunaa gaya he
 The entire country and international community are happy with this
 main dil se unhen badhai detaa hum
 'just then what was the happiness of Amitabh's fans, there was no place
 tamaam soshal media plateforms par logon kii badhaaiyon kaa tantaa lag gaya
 Anil Kapoor, Karan Johar, Lata Mangeshkar, Sachin Tendulkar began to congratulate all the celebrities
 jiske baad khud amitabh bachchan ne bhi twit kar logon kaa abhivadan kiya amitabh ne twit kar likhaa ''kritagya hum main , paripurna , aabhaar or dhanyavad
 
 
 i am only a humble, humble Amitabh Bachchan
 '' amitabh bachchan ko apane kariyar main kai puraskaron se nawaja gaya he
 In childhood, our grandparents used to tell us that when they were small, that is, in their childhood, cinema meant Amitabh Bachchan
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki sirf amitabh hi the
 There were also many artists like Dharmendra, Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna in that decade
 magar jo amitabh kaa craij hua karata tha logon main wo kuch ore hi tha
 But if we talk about our era i
e
 today, then it would not be wrong to say that Amitabh is not an actor of our times
 big bi to aaj ke bhi actor hai
 We should not forget that in 2015, Amitabh received the National Film Award for Best Actor for the film Piku
 san,1975 main ai film sholay jise 90 ke dashak ke ant main paidaa hue har ek bachche ne apane bachapan main amitabh kii pehali film agar koi dekhi hogi to wo yakeenan sholay hi hogi
 i also saw Amitabh's first film, it was Sholay
 magar sholay hi nahin shahenshaah, zanjeer, namakhalaal, diwaar, mard, laavaaris, kaaliya ye tamaam filmein agar aaj bhi tivi par aa jaaen to log tivi ke saamne se hilne kaa naam nahin lete he
 It is said that no Bollywood means Amitabh Bachchan
 ye kahana kattai galat nahin hoga ki amitabh jis tarah se pichley paanch dashako se silver screen par apane behtareen rolls se anterten kar rahe amitabh aaj bhi 76 saal kii umr main bhi utane hi active hai jitna wo pehle the
 He has given proof of this many times
 amitabh ne aise-aise kirdaar nibhaae he jo shaayad hi koi or itani bakhubi nibhaa paata
 Then whether he is Paa's character in the film, even today, one cannot recognize Paa's character that he is Amitabh Bachchan
 film industry main shaayad hi aisa koi kalakaar hoga jiske saath amitabh bachchan ne kaam nahin kiya hoga
 Bachchan has previously won the National Film Award four times for Best Actor
 saath amitabh ko saal 1984main padam shri, 2001 main padam bhushan or saal 2015 main padam vibhushan se sammanit kiya ja chukaa hai
 Some interesting facts related to the award - The year from which Amitabh started his career and the number of years that he has been in this industry, this year has also been held
 yani dada sahab phalke aword ko
 Amitabh started his career in the year 1969 with seven Hindustani films
 or is puraskaar kii shuruyaat bhi usee saal yani saal 1969 main hui thi
 That year, actress Devika Rani was honored with this award
 do tarah kaa he yah aword-dadasahab phalke aword kya do tarah ke aword hote hai ? baat kuch samaj nahin ai! darasal, baat aisi he ki do tarah ke dadasahab phalke aword kalakaaron ko milte hai
 The first one is given by the government which is getting Amitabh Bachchan this year
 jise dadasahab phalke aword kehete hai
 The second which is Dada Saheb Phalke Foundation Award, is given by an organization

 ' The Congress has adopted Modi's bet to defeat the BJP in the Gujarat Assembly elections
 unhone hindutv ko hathiyaar banaakar bijepi or aresas se nipatane ke saaf sanket pehle hi de die the
 Addressing a party rally in Chennai in June, Rahul Gandhi had said that he was studying the Upanishads Gita to fight the political war with BJP and RSS
 ab rahul gandhi gujarat fatah ke liye tabadatod reliyaan or daure kar rahe hai
 During this time, he is also constantly going to the temple and offering prayers
 rahul ke is hindutvvaadi jhukaav kii vajah raajnneetik maani ja rahi he
 Today also on Wednesday, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi started his fourth Gujarat tour during the assembly elections with a darshan at Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar
 is dauraan akshardham mandir ke sant ne rahul gandhi kii agavaani kii
 This is the same temple where Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently visited during his visit to Gujarat
 PM modi ne gujarat ke akshardham mandir ke rajat jayanti samaaroh main bhi shirkat kii thi
 PM Modi was received by Sant Brahmabihari Swamy at Akshardham temple at that time
 itnaa hi nahin, aaj rahul gandhi banaaskantha jile main ambaji mandir bhi jaaenge
 He will stay in Ambaji at night
 congress party kaa yah soft hindutv rukh us samay dekhne ko mila he, jab party gujarat main satta vaapasi ke liye jor laga rahi he
 As a political strategy, whatever programs were made from Rahul's first visit to the last tour, this fourth tour, he revolved around Hinduism
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is dauraan rahul ke daure main koi muslim netaa aas-paas bhatka bhi najar nahin aayaa
 In this election, Congress did not even raise the issue of Muslim
 ab tak ke chunaav prachaar main congress ne yaa to patidaar samudaay yaa phir notebandi or jiesti kaa hi mudda uthaaya
 During this, there was also a shrewd style in Rahul Gandhi's speeches
 is bich soshal media par rahul kii lokapriyata bhi badi
 Questions were also raised on the increase in the number of followers of Rahul on Twitter, to which Rahul Gandhi responded by tweeting the video of PD
 iske baad rahul ke pidi ne twitor par jamkar dhamal machaaya or is par khub bahes hui
 Now the question is whether Rahul will be able to unfurl his victory in Gujarat with the help of soft Hindutva

 Recently, after the exit of Team India from the World Cup, the BCCI image suffered a setback when the main sponsor from the team's jersey, Oppo, pulled his hand in the middle
 sutara ke mutabik, oppo ko ummid ke mutabik phayda nahin hua or praayojan kaa kharch company ko baari padane laga
 The Chinese smartphone maker had taken sponsorship rights for five years by paying about 1,080 crore
 oppo ke saath 14 gharelu siries or 20 videshi sirijon ke liye 5 saal kaa qaraar kiya gaya tha, jisamen champions trophy, world cap or tii-20 world cap shaamil hai
 But the company did not like this deal
 haalanki aankade bataate hai ki 2019 kii pehali timahi main oppo 7
 Remains in the Indian market with a 6 per cent share, but Oppo sales have increased marginally over the past year
 company ne isi aankadon ko dekhte hue faisla liya ki ab bisisiai kaa saath chhodane main hi bhalaai he
 Although sales of OPPO may not have increased, the Indian smart phone market has grown at a rate of 7 per cent, while sales of smart phones have fallen by 6 per cent worldwide
 do saal pehle oppo ne kaha tha ‘bharat main cricket sirf khel nahin he- jivan kaa hissaa he, ek sabhyataa he yaa yun kahen ek dharm he’ lekin ab isi company ko ye keemat mahangi pad rahi he
 Byju, a Bangalore-based company on Team India's jersey, has replaced Oppo

 They are talking about the terms of ownership transfer among themselves
 ’ naam na bataane kii shart par bisisiai ke ek bade adhikari ne india today ko ye jaankaree di

 56 crores
 bisisiai ko mali taur par koi nuksaan nahin hoga kyonki nai company utane hi paise degi jitna oppo detii thi, lekin is faisle se team kii image ko jhatka jarur laga he
 The BCCI official said, "the board allows the transfer of sponsorship, but there is a secret clause in this agreement, under which the details of the commercial deal cannot be made public"
 bisisiai ke duusare adhikari ne kaha, ‘oppo ke is faisle se board ko phayda hi hoga, kyonki praayojak transfar karne par duusare aayojak ko 10 fisadi rakam zyada deni hogi, ab unhen 6 maheene kaa notice dena hoga or is bich wo aapas main tay karenge ki aakhir ye 10 fisadi atirikt rakam kaa boj koun uthayega

 Bhagwat said that this mistake should not be repeated
 (input bhashaa se) We all look at a political party with a very limited view
 falaan party haaregi yaa jeetegi, netaa kaa brands chamak rahaa he yaa feekaa pad gaya he
 But at the same time many processes are going on simultaneously within the political party
 jaise ham nahin jaanate ki iti cell ke aagaman ke baad party ke swabhimani or mehnatee kaaryakartaaon kii bhoomika kaise badal gai he
 Have they started to think of themselves as important workers running IT cells from headquarters to district offices and the task of the old workers is to forward only messages sent in whatsapp
 raajnneetik dal bahut badale hai
 In this election, when the Bharatiya Janata Party is contesting for the second time under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, its new offices have been ready in many districts
 meerut kaa yah daftar ab jarjar avasthaa main he magar hameshaa to aisa nahin rahaa hoga
 There will be many memories here of the early days of the party
 kitne kaaryakarta yahaan aate jate khap gaye honge or kitne mahaan ban gaye honge
 The regional and district office of the BJP also used to run in this office
 hamaare sahyogi shyaam parmaar ne bataaya ki meerut kaa yah purana offis baba manohar nath mandir trust kii sampatti he jisamen bijepi kaa karyaalay 20-25 saal se ek bade kamare main chal rahaa tha
 Like this Faizabad office is old
 babari masjid dhwans ke dauraan yahaan par bhaajapa ke sabhi bade netaaon kaa aana janaa hota hoga
 But now it is starting to look like black and white photographs of bygone days
 1980 main bani bijepi ke daan or kiraaye par chalane vaale daftar itihaas se mitaa die jaaenge
 Similarly, this office in Firozabad is old
 es en aspataal ke saamne jain mandir ke chauraahey ke paas hua karata tha jo ab band ho chukaa he
 Now a new office is being built here
 dabarai mukhyalay se ek kilometre dur phirozabad road enech-2 par ban rahaa he
 Shopping is going on in the complex
 yahaan ab taala lag chukaa he
 a party is building several hundred new offices
 isaki na to kahin charchaa he or na hi is par report
 The Mint news of May 19, 2015, states that the BJP will create a national network of offices in an effort to connect the land and collect funds from supporters
 bijepi 630 zilon main party kaa karyaalay banane vaali he jinhen video conferencing ke zarie rajya or dilli ke mukhyalay se joda jayega
 The BJP has offices in 280 districts and by 2016, offices in the remaining 350 districts will be ready
 jahaan daftar he vahaan bhi nayaa daftar bana he
 We do not know what is the cost of them, what is the cost of buying land and building buildings
 media main party fund ko lekar jo khabaren aa rahi hai uske anusaar 2017-18 main chah raajnneetik dalon ko kul 1293 karod aamadani hui
 The highest but more than 90 percent of bjp's income is 1027 crore
 jinamein se 53
 9% of the income is from unknown sources
 kisi research ko adhyayan karnaa chahie tha, ricard karnaa chahie tha ki 600 se adhik nae daftaron kii dizine kya he, inaki banaavat aane vaale dinon main kis tarah ke raajnneetik dal kii tasviir pesh karti he
 How the seating arrangement of the president to the general secretaries within the building is telling the structure of the organization
 in mukhyalayon or karyaalayon ke zarie bijepi aane vaale dinon main nai smritiyon kii rachana bhi kar rahi he
 It is possible that now the role of office in party activity is going to be more permanent and important than ever before
 kisi ke ghar yaa dukaan se party chalaane kii pratha shaayad band ho jaae
 Like the office building in Meerut is ready
 dekhne se mal or thri star hotalon kii yaad dilaati he magar chakachak yah daftar party fund ke paise se bana he
 The land has been purchased
 parking kii vyavastha he
 The first floor has a hall with a capacity of 200 people
 ek conference haul bhi he
 There are 34 rooms
 iske bheetar aakar lagata he he ki daan dakshina main di gai imaaraton se chalane vaali raajnneeti ke din chale gaye
 Workers and leaders will soon see that they have come to the shopping complex
 abhi tak party karyaalay hone ke baad bhi netaa apane ghar yaa hotel main hi baithken kar lete the, magar itani taiyaari se yahi lagata he ki ye sab bhi band hoga or party kii raajnneetik gatividhi kisi prabhaavshaalee ke ghar dukaan se nahin is daftar se chalegi
 Staff accommodation is also provided
 hamane isaki laagat pataa karne kii koshish kii magar jaankaree nahin di gai
 It was said that there was a purchase from Lucknow office, they would know
 dilli main bhi 2018 main bijepi kaa ek nayaa mukhyalay bana, kabhi internet par iske bare main search kiijie
 Hardly found the inner picture
 sari tasviir mukhyalay ke baahar kii he
 How much this headquarters was built, no concrete information was found in the media report
 2 acre zamin main yah mukhyalay bana he
 It has three blocks
 ek blaak 7 manzil kaa he
 The remaining two blocks are of 3-3 floors
 70 kamare hai
 The Economic Times reports 18 February 2018
 isamen amit shah kaa bayaan he ki duniya main kisi bhi dal kaa itnaa bada mukhyalay nahin he
 How much does it cost, never told
 itio ke paas itnaa bhavy mukhyalay to do chaar karod main nahin hi ban saktaa he
 It is a must that not all are built in Delhi, but offices are also built in the districts
 
 In Uttar Pradesh alone, 51 new offices are ready and are being built
 kai jagah puri tarah se taiyaar hai or kai jagahon par antim charan main hai
 Firozabad's office has also become new
 ye daftar to taiyaar hai magar chunaav ke kaaran kai jagahon par puri tarah chaalu nahin hue hai
 The BJP flag also has two colors in the color of the building
 mathura ke nae daftar ke bare main media main khabar chap gai thi ki conection ke bagaiyr hi bijli chal rahi thi yani bijli chori ho rahi thi
 The connection has been taken after reports surfaced in the media
 mathura vaala daftar pushpanjali upavan main he
 About 200 meters in place
 ek anumaan ke mutabik zamin kii keemat 45-50 lakh hogi or imaarat ke banane kii laagat 60-70 lakh ho sakati he
 That is, the source says about the cost of one and a half to one and a half crores
 par yah pukhta jaankaree nahin he
 This BJP office is from Shravasti in UP
 vahi shravasti jahaan buddha cirkil banane ke vaade ko do saal main kuch nahin hua magar ek saal main bhaajapa kaa nayaa karyaalay ban gaya
 Here too the BJP did not have its own office earlier
 baharich main bhaajapa kaa apana karyaalay nahin tha magar yahaan nai imaarat ban kar kareeb kareeb taiyaar he
 The three-story building has been inaugurated
 is imaarat kii laagat kii jaankaree nahin mil saki
 It is not a common occurrence for a party to create hundreds of offices
 6 april ko bijepi upi ke 51 zilon main ek saath apane party karyaalayon kaa udghaatan karegi
 51 offices will be made from crores of rupees but no one gives the exact number
 aakhir zamin kharidne se lekar 51 jagahon par teen manzila imaarat banane main kuch to laagat ai hogi
 Should a political party not inform itself of this? nae daftar banane main bijepi ne puure desh main or upi main kitne karod kharch kiye
 That is, there was no impact of recession or demonetisation
 real state bhale manda chal rahaa he magar bhaajapa ne dikhaa diya he uskaa apana real state safal rahaa he
 Similarly, during the Madhya Pradesh elections, Anurag Dwari had reported the condition of bjp's new office in Jabalpur
 madhya pradesh main 51 zile hai
 New offices have been created in all except 9 districts
 42 nae daftar bane hai
 Wouldn't it be interesting to know how many crores BJP spent in building hundreds of offices
 paisa kahaan se aayaa he
 Has all this happened with the money of donations? sikkim krantikari morcha (SKM) ne shuukravaar ko bhaajapa ke saath apana gathbandhan tod liya or sikkim kii sabhi vidhansabha siton or loksabhaa kii ekmaatr seat par maidan main utarane kaa nirnay liya

 The meeting was presided over by SKM President Prem Singh Tamang

 There is a Lok Sabha seat here
 yah seat isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki yah puure rajya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 The Sikkim Lok Sabha constituency is for the general category, that is, unreserved
 yahaan rajyasabha ke liye bhi ek seat he
 Sikkim has only one Lok Sabha constituency
 yahaan rajyasabha ke liye bhi ek seat he
 The Assembly has 32 seats
 sikkim main sikkim krantikari morcha, sikkim democratic front (esadf) sahit kuch chote sthaneey raajnneetik dal hai
 However national parties like BJP, Congress, Trinamool are also active here
 sikkim main kul 3,70,731 matadaata hai jinamein 1,79,650 mahilaayein shaamil hai
 Sikkim has the lowest population among the states of India and its area is more than just Goa
 sikkim bhugolic drushti se kaaphi vividhtapurna he
 Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest peak, is on the border of Nepal in the northern western part of Sikkim

 At least 47 people were killed and 25 others injured on Saturday in a shootout between tribesmen over a controversial mountain area near the Afghan border in Pakistan

 The official said, 'so far 47 people have been killed and 25 others have been injured in the village of Laora Mandi in the donor game area
 ' a security source said that fierce fighting has been going on since Friday between the Mada Khel and Pappali Kabul Khel tribesmen of North Waziristan over the possession of the mountain

 ' rama ekadshi (rama Ekadashi) kaa hindu dharm main bada mahatmaya he
 It is believed that all sins are destroyed by the effect of this fast
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar jo bhakt sachche man or vidhi vidhaan se rama ekadshi kaa vrath karata he, katha padhata he yaa sunata he use sabhi paapon se chhutkaaraa mil jaataa he or mrityu uparaant use vishnu lok kii prapti hoti he
 Worshiping Maa Lakshmi Puja along with Lord Vishnu on this Ekadashi (ekadashi) is also considered very auspicious and auspicious
 rama ekadshi dhanteras se ek din pehle aati he
 Thinking like this, Shobhan fasted and started suffering from hunger and thirst
 jab surya narayan ast ho gaye or raatri ko jaagran kaa samay aayaa jo vaishnavon ko atyant harsh dene vaala tha, parantu shobhan ke liye atyant du:khadaayi hua
 Shobhan died in the morning
 tab raja ne sugandhit kashtha se uskaa dah sanskaar karavaaya
 After Shobhan's funeral, she started living in her father's house
 rama ekadshi ke prabhaav se shobhan ko mandarachal parvat par dhan-dhaany se yukt tathaa shatruon se rahit ek sundar devpur praapt hua
 He was adorned on a throne decorated with precious robes and chhatras and chavars, decorated with many types of rhinestone beads made of extremely beautiful gems and Vaidyurmani-studded golden pillars, mounted on a throne containing Gandharvas and Apsaras, as if the second Indra was seated
 ek samay muchukund nagar main rahane vaale ek som sharma naamak brahman tirthayatra karata hua ghumta-ghumta udhar ja niklaa or usne shobhan ko pahchaan kar kaha ki yah to raja kaa jamaai shobhan he, uske nikat gaya
 Shobhan too recognizing him got up from his seat and came near him and bowed and asked a skilled question
 brahman ne kaha, "raja muchukund or aapaki patni kushal se hai
 The city is also efficient in every way, but o Rajan! We are surprised
 aap apana vrittant kahie ki aisa sundar nagar jo na kabhi dekha, na suna, aapako kaise praapt hua
 " tab shobhan bolaa ki karthik krishna kii rama ekadshi kaa vrath karne se mujhe yah nagar praapt hua, parantu yah asthir he
 Take such a remedy when it becomes stable
 brahman kehane laga, "he rajan! yah sthir kyon nahin he or kaise sthir ho saktaa he aap bataaie, phir main avashyamev vah upaay karuunga
 Do not misunderstand this matter of mine
 " shobhan ne kaha, "maine is vrath ko shraddharahit hokar kiya he
 Hence, everything is unstable
 yadi aap muchukund kii kanya chandrabhaga ko yah sab vrittant kahen to yah sthir ho saktaa he
 " aisa sunakar us shreshth brahman ne apane nagar lautakar chandrabhaga se sab vrittant kah sunaaya
 Hearing the words of the Brahmin, Chandrabhaga started saying to the Brahmin with great pleasure, "O Brahmin! You have seen all these things directly or are talking about dreams
 " brahman kehane laga, "he putree! maine mahaavan main tumhaare pati ko pratyaksh dekha he
 Also, they have seen their city like a city of gods, so that there is no victory over anyone
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah sthir nahin he
 As soon as he can remain stable, measures should be taken
 " Chandrabhaga started saying, "O Vipra! You take me there, i have a longing for the vision of husband
 main apane kiye hue punya se us nagar ko sthir bana duungi
 You should do such a thing which is our coincidence because mixing the separation is a great virtue
 " yah baat sunakar brahman chandrabhaga ko lekar mandarachal parvat ke sameep vamdev rishi ke ashram par gaya
 Wamdevji heard the whole thing and anointed Chandrabhaga with the pronunciation of Veda mantras
 tab rishi ke mantra ke prabhaav or ekadshi ke vrath se chandrabhaga kaa sharir divya ho gaya or vah divya gati ko praapt hui
 After this she went to her husband with great pleasure
 apni priy patni ko aate dekhakar shobhan ati prasann hua or use bulaakar apni bain taraf bitha liya
 Chandrabhaga started saying, "O Prannath! You accept my merit
" apane pita ke ghar jab main aath varsh kii thi tab se vidhipurvak ekadshi ke vrath ko shraddhapurvak karti aa rahi hum
 Due to the greatness of this virtue, your city will become stable and will remain till the end of the Holocaust with all the deeds

 On 24th April, Dinkar's death anniversary, special poet Ramdhari Singh 'dinkar' not only gave a new height to the poetry of Veer Rasa in Hindi literature, but also created national consciousness through his compositions
 isaki ek misaal 70 ke dashak main sampurna kranti ke daur main milti he
 At the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan, in front of thousands of people, had raised a revolt against the then government by proclaiming Dinkar's line 'empty the throne that the public comes'
 maujuuda daur ke mashhoor kavi prem janamejay bhi maanate hai ki dinakar ne gulam bharat or aaazaad bharat donon main apni kavitaaon ke jariye krantikari vichaaron ko vistaar diya
 Janmejaya said in a conversation with 'bhasha', 'dinkar raised national consciousness among the people through his poems at the time of independence and the attack of China
 ’dinakar kaa janm 23 sitambar, 1908 ko bihar ke begusarai jile main hua

 is bare main janamejay kehete hai, ‘bhushan ke baad dinakar hi ekmaatr aise kavi rahe, jinhone vir ras kaa khub istemaal kiya
 It was a period when the feeling of nationalism within the people was in full swing
 dinakar ne usee bhaavana ko apane kavita ke madhyam se aage badhaayaa
 He was the father of the nation, which is why he was also called the President
 ’desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai main bhi dinakar ne apana yogadan diya

 Jaydev Thackeray, son of late Shiv Sena president Bal Thackeray, claimed in the Bombay High Court on Tuesday that his father wanted him to be his political successor but he was not keen on it even though his ex-wife Smita had his own political ambitions
 duusare din chote bhaiuddhav thakreke vakeelon ke poochne par jayadev ne bataaya ki unke dada kii 1973 main maut ke baad se wo apni pita kii madad karne lage the
 Bal Thackeray's elder son Bindu Madhav was involved in his business and films
 us samay uddav apane hobbi photography ko lekar kaaphi syrius the or isliye unke pita apane raajnneetik kaamon ko lekar unheen par nirbhar the
 During this, he also asked Jaidev to join politics
 lekin jayadev kaa maananaa tha ki raajnneeti buree cheez hoti he, jisamen rishton kaa mahatva nahi hota
 Therefore, he had told his father that he did not want to enter politics
 jayadev ne kaha- uddhav ne rashan card se naam hataane kii sajeesh rachijayadevamen bhari adaalat main ye aarope lagaaya ki parivaar ke rashan card se unka naam hataane kaa shadyantra uddhav ne hi rachaa tha
 Jaidev said that Uddhav's influence had started in the house since 2003 and at that time a man asked AK to sign him on a paper which would remove his name from the ration card
 us shaks se jayadev ne poocha tha ki ye kisne karne ko bolaa he to usne kaha sahib ne
 Jaidev used to say that the only Saheb for him was his father
 isliye inhone apane pita se is bare main poocha to bal thakare ne aisa karne se saaf manaa kar diya
 He even said that he will go to the root of this mischief and find out who did it
 uddhav ke vakil ne jayadev se poochne kii koshish kii kii aakhir uddhav ne hi ye kiya ye unhen kaise laga
 But Jaidev gave the same answer
 jayadev kii patni ko adaalat se baahar jane ke liye kahajayadev kii patni anuraadhaa bhi adaalat main maujuud thim lekin unhen baahar jane ke liye kaha gaya
 During this, Jaidev told that around 1991, his mother Meena Thackeray had talked about breaking the house and making it back
 ye plan mata-pita ne sabase pehle jayadev ko hi bataaya tha or uske baad baaki sadasyon ko
 But at the same time, Bindu Madhav gave up the claim on his share in the house
 bindu madhav kaa apana ghar tha, vyapaar tha or usee samay unke bacchon kii pariksha bhi thi
 For these reasons he did not claim the house
 unke anusaar ghar main phir uddhav, jayadev or unke mata-pita ke rahane or raajnneetik kaam karne ke liye jagah banaai gai
 Lawyer asked - Why did not come back to stay in Matoshree? Uddhav's lawyer Rohit Kapadia asked Jaidev if he had any money to build the house and did he have any proof of this? On this Jayadev said that when he used to come for the house, he used to give money, many times he also gave cash, but he does not have any receipt for it
 is par kapaadiya ne unase poocha kii jab ghar taiyaar ho gaya tab wo waapas matoshri main kyon nahin aae
 On this Jayadev said that he had prepared the first floor of the house according to his needs and kept his salmon in it
 lekin tab unki patni smita thakare jo baar-baar raajnneeti main utarane kii baat karti thi or ye baat unhen bilkul raas nahin aa rahi thi
 Matoshri used to stay with the father during the day: Jayadev tried hard to convince Smita to pay attention to Jayadev and his son
 iske liye jayadev apane parivaar ko lekar kaaleen main ek flats main bhi rahane lage
 Jaidev said that when Matoshree was ready and everyone started going back to stay there, his father only told him that he should stay with Smita on the carpet
 unhen bhi smita kaa shiv sena party kii raajnneeti main hastkshep karnaa raas nahin aa rahaa tha
 Jaidev said that during this time he lived with his father in Matoshree during the day and in the carpet at night
 jayadev kaa bayaan darj karne kaa silsilaa buudhvaar ko bhi jari rahegaa

 Apart from these, which other countries come in the map of this Khorasan

 shahid ne haal hi main kunal kohli kii film 'teri meri kahani' kii shooting puri kii he
 In this film he will be seen opposite Priyanka Chopra but apart from this he is looking for roles
 yah film 22 june ko relies hogi
 The comments shahid ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan patrakaron se kaha, "dusron kii tarah main yah nahin kahana chahta ki mere paas falaan-falaan filmein hai
 The reason for this is that i do not have any work at the moment
 is lihaaj se philhal main berozegaar hum
 " shahid ne apane prashansakon se kaha ki unhen niraash hone kii jarurat nahin kyonki varsh ke uttarardh main unke paas kaam hi kaam hoga
 Shahid said, “I will have many films in the second half of this year
 " Shahid has recently completed shooting for Kunal Kohli's film 'teri Meri Kahaani'
 is film main vah priyanka chopra ke saath dikhenge lekin iske alaava unhen bhoomikaaon kii talash he
 The film will be released on 22 June
 tippaniyan Shahid told reporters during an event, "like others, i do not want to say that i have such and such films
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki mere paas philhal koi kaam nahin he
 i am currently unemployed in this regard
 " Shahid told his fans that he need not be disappointed as he will have work to do in the latter part of the year
 shahid ne kaha, "is saal kii duusari chamahi main mere paas kai filmein hongi
 " shahid ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan patrakaron se kaha, "dusron kii tarah main yah nahin kahana chahta ki mere paas falaan-falaan filmein hai

 " dosti ke kai myne hai or kai aayam
 This is a relationship that can be understood less and more than realized
 duniya aaj dosti kaa jashn manaa rahi he, aise main hamane gaur kiya ki un rishton par, jo desh main dosti kii misaal maane jate hankrishna-sudamadosti koi diwaar nahin jaanati, koi antar nahin samajhati
 krishna-sudama's friendship also teaches us the same
 bachapan ke saath jab kai saal milte hai, to krishna dwarka ke raja ban chuke hote hai or sudama nirdhan
 But despite this, Krishna meets Sudama as if the Lord himself is nothing without his friendship, say the love between Ram and Hanuman devotee and God or friendship shows such a relationship between Lord Rama and his devotee Hanuman in Ramcharitmanas, which is unprecedented
 shriram kii seva ho, lakshmana ko bachaane kii jugat yaa mata sita se milane ko samandar langhna, hanuman ne shriram ke liye sab kuch kiya
 And when Sina tearfully showed that God is still in his heart, there is mention of karna-duryodhana Mahabharata, then our attention goes to the war fought in Kurukshetra between the kaurava-pandavas, but it also underlined the friendship of Karna and Duryodhana
 Can
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki apane bhaaiyon kii mrityu par ek aansu naa giraane vaala duryondhan, karn ke chale jane se foot-footkar royaa tha
 And Karna left no stone unturned to befriend the father and son, so most of us are afraid and hesitant about our father more than the mother in childhood
 lekin umr or samaj badhane par ahsaas hota he ki pita se badhiya or paripakv koi dost nahin hota
 We can tell them everything in our mind and they also understand them, because the same things they have experienced before themselves, mother and daughter, some similar synergy is also seen between mother and daughter
 ham aisa nahin kar rahe ki maa or bete ke bich prem kam hota he, lekin maa-beti ke bich paraspar sahyog kaa jo str dekhne ko miltaa he, wo laajawab he
 It is often seen that sometimes the sons are unable to take care of the parents as much as the daughters
 laajawab dosti!jai-viruye dosti ham nahin todenge
 
 
 For the last nearly 40 years, this song has been a means of understanding and understanding friendship
 sikaa uchhaalkar achchhai kii taraf koi faisla karnaa ho yaa apni jaan daanv par lagaakar dost ko bachaana, jai or viru apradhi hone ke baavjood hamen dosti kerani or nibhaani, donon sikhaa gaye
 Tom and Jerryham have all seen such cartoons in childhood, in which there will be friendship and relationship too
 lekin tom or jeri kaa aisa behtareen rishta doosraa nahin miltaa, jo din bhar ladate rahen, lekin saajha musiibat saamne aane par saath ho jaaen
 Stay together, fight and separate, then get bored
 asaliyat main kya dosti or dost kuch isi tarah nahin hote? ham sabhi main tom or jeri jo chipa he
 We and God and our closest and greatest friend in Akhir
 bhagwaan, khuda, yishu
 
 
 Name it, the one above is the same
 or ham jab musiibat main hote hai, aksar isi dost ke paas jate hai
 And he also gives us courage and encouragement, so that we can fight again and stand up again
 khushi main ham apni kaabiliyat kaa dambh bharte hai or naakaami, uske sir daal dete hai
 But he never feels bad

 Azhar Ali, who has played 66 Test matches for Pakistan, said that after this humorous runout, i hope that even a 10-year-old son will not hold back from pulling me
 ko lekar ajahar ne kaha, 'meraa betaa nishchit rup se mazaakia lahaze main is bare main lambey samay tak mujhase baat karegaa
 Azhar said lightly that whenever i talk about cricket, he (son Ibtisam) will remind me of this incident
 ibtisam apane pita ke out hone ke baad maidan par pahunchaa tha
 There were also interesting reactions on social media about Azhar's dismissal in this hunky manner

 India lost by just 48 runs on the evening of the fifth day, despite hitting a century in every innings for this unconventional captain
 yah dard use jivan bhar salata rahegaa
 a new look of Virat Kohli blossomed by arriving in the mournful dressing room just minutes after taking a long way to the pavilion with a bloodshot wound to his mind
 usne champion kii tarah ballebaaji kii thi or ab senapati kii tarah apane saathiyon main dilari bharne laga
 In the dressing room, he was telling his teammates that there were two paths in front of him, either to pat him on the back and claim a moral victory for a counter-attack on the fifth day of the first Test or try to find out whether the victory Why did his steps falter when he reached the threshold
 saaf jaahir tha ki kohli unhen adhik bechun karne vaale duusare vikalp par dimag lagane ke liye uksaa rahaa tha
 In the dressing room, a word did not come out of anybody's mouth on this question of Kohli, no one blinked
 team, koching staff or chot ke kaaran test se baahar rahe captain mahendra singh dhoni bhi saaf dekh rahe the ki yuvaraj ne apane rajbhishek kaa bigul baja diya he
 "his speech was better than his batting that day," one player told India Today
 apane out hone or match haarane ke baad sabase adhik dukhi use hona chahie tha lekin usne puure dressing room main nai jaan daal di
 There was never a question of "if" in front of Kohli, the question was just when
 ’’ dhoni ne 2014 kaa patakshep test cricket se apane sanyas kii ghoshnaa se kiya or team kii lagaam captain kool se captain dabang ke haath main aa gai
 Indicating his future intentions in the case of odis, the selectors called Kohli in Australia to get an opinion about the 2015 World Cup squad, while Dhoni and coach Duncan Fletcher officially called the selection committee meeting via video conference
 Took part in kohli ke bataur captain udai kaa matlab bhartiya cricket main bada peedigat badlaav he or usne abhi se apane saathiyon ko sanket de diya he ki ve aage bade saanskrithik badlaav ke liye taiyaar ho jaaen
 He has clearly stated that he will have to play and compete like Australia and win Test matches abroad
 bharat ke purnakalik test captain ke rup main pehle hi match main kohli ne sidney main chauthe test kii team se shikhar dhawan or cheteshwar pujaara ko baahar kar diya
 Both were struggling in Test cricket
 desh ke ek sabase safal captain saurabh ganguli ne sidney se kaha, ‘‘yah kohli kii team hogi
 He will have to prepare his dressing room anew
 main uski ballebaaji kaa or khel ke prati uske nazariye kaa bada prashansak hum
 So i would love to see him becoming a captain from a great player
 bharat kii captaini bahut jald hi apane baari tanaav se logon ke bal safed kar sakati he
 i really would be very happy if winning the test was his priority

 Since the departure of Laxman's great quartet, the manner in which Indian fans have been turning away from cricket, there are many reasons for Kohli to achieve success in a renewed manner
 uske tevar tikhe hai (aakhirkaar westeindies ke kris gail or england ke kevin petersan kii ginati kohli ke sabase achche doston main hoti he) or ab tak khel kaa koi satr aisa nahin gaya jab australian khiladinnon se uski garmagarmee na hui ho
 He roams not only the tattoo on his sleeve, but also the heart
 abhinetri anoushka sharma uski garlfriend hai
 Despite this, whenever the 26-year-old Virat comes on the field for the test, he is wearing an old-fashioned blue cap which clearly means he respects the traditions
 apane 33wein test main kohli ne bhale hi mahanata kii bulandi ko na chuaa ho par vah uski taraf lambii chalaang le rahaa he
 His debut in Test cricket was undoubtedly slow
 pehali paanch pariyon main usne sirf 76 ran banaae
 But has scored 10 centuries since the first innings of the fourth Test
 iskaa matlab har 3
 Has a century in 3 Tests
 yah anupaat sunil gavaskar ke kariyar ke isi daur ke anupaat se thodaa hi peeche lekin tendulkar yaa rahul dravid se kahin aage he
 a first-innings century in Sydney has made Kohli the first captain to score a century in his first three innings while at the summit
 kohli cricket kii duniya main shikhar tak pahonchega, iskaa sanket usne apana pehla test khilne se pehle hi de diya tha
 Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh almost threatened him on a tour of South Africa in 2010-11, saying, "if you don't score 10,000 runs in Test cricket then watch
 ’’lekin kohli ke liye rasta hameshaa aasaan nahin tha
 He was always mischievous when he reached Rajkumar's coaching academy in West Delhi at the age of 9
 agle chaar saal main usne apana khel aisa kamaal kaa sudhara ki under 14 lig main dilli kii taraf se sabase zyada ran batore
 Despite such a brilliant game, he was shocked when he was not selected for the Delhi Under-14 team
 khud ranjai khilaadi rah chuke rajkumaar ne garv se bataaya, ‘‘vah bahut royaa lekin haar maanane kii bajaae doguni mehnat kii
 Two years later, when he played in the Delhi Under-17 team, he hit two double centuries
 ’’kohli ne 18 saal kii umr main 2006 main dilli kii taraf se ranjai trophy match main kadam rakhaa
 His firmest intentions were first noticed when, despite his father's death a day earlier, he came on the field to play his remaining innings against Karnataka
 usee manodasha main usne 90 ran banaae, dilli ke liye game bachaaya or ankhon main aansu liye pita ke antim sanskaar ke liye maidan se chalaa gaya
 After leading the winning India U-19 team at the Youth World Cup in Malaysia in 2008, he climbed into the eyes of chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar
 unhone kohli ko fouran antarrashtriya cricket ke akhaade main utaar diya
 He made his debut as an opener for India in a one-day match in Sri Lanka, though he never came to open in club matches
 or phir vah rasta bhatak gaya
 Everyone started worrying about his attitude and desire for a comfortable life
 indian premier lig main vijay maalya kii bhadkeeli royal chalangers team kii taraf se khelte hue vah bangaloru main jam gaya
 Having lost the way, he was removed from the Indian team and would have been sidelined by the prospect of a player who could not live up to the expectations
 rajkumaar ne mana, ‘‘vah patari se utar gaya tha or meri bhoomika uske coach kii bajaae bade bhai kii ho gai
 i used to reprimand him
 uske peeche laganaa padataa tha or hameshaa kahata rahata tha ki abhyaas karo, abhyaas karo
 However, after being battered and defeated in this way, he again realized that cricket is his only priority and discipline and dedication are his best friends
 dhire-dhire use lay mil gai or man main prerana bhi waapas aa gai
 Shortly after his return to the team, Kohli became India's mainstay in ODI cricket
 2012 main edilade main pehla test shatak jamaane ke baad vah test cricket main bhi khulkar haath aajamaane laga
 There was some lethargy in England last year when he could not score a single half-century in 10 innings
 aaj kohli kii ginati vishwa cricket main aise ballebaajon main hone lagi he jisase gedbaajon ko sabase zyada dar lagata he
 Kohli was recognized by former captain Kapil Dev when he was the director of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore
 kapil dev ko lagata he ki nae bhartiya captain main sabhi gun hai, ‘‘vah aklmand cricketer he
 When it bats, it seems that compass has been brought to mind and calculator in pocket
 uski sahaj pravriti hamalaa karne kii he or mujhe khushi he ki england kii susti se vah itani acchhee tarah ubar gaya he
 "another successful captain of India, Mohammad Azharuddin believes that Kohli's captaincy will have a good impact on the team
" lekin ajahar kohli ko saavdhaan bhi karte hai, ‘‘ek to, use maidan par apane gusse par kaabo rakhana hoga or virodhiyon se takaraav se bachanaa hoga
 Secondly, if the team does not perform well then their batting may be affected because the tension of captaincy is heavy
 ’’kohli kaa aglaa padaav vishwacap he
 He scored a century in his first World Cup match in 2011
 bharat ke vishwacap jeetne ke baad usne sabase yaadgaar line kahi thi
 He had asked for Tendulkar, "he kept the expectations of the country for years
 ab hamen unhen apane kandhon par uthaane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 "often the cycle comes back there in the world, so India's hopes are now fully placed on Kohli's shoulders

 bataa den ki myanmar kii yatra karne vaale zyaadaatar log, khaastaur par bhartiya, muslim or rajgharaanon main ruchi rakhane vaale log bahadur shah jafar kii dargah jarur jate hai
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also visited Bahadur Shah Zafar's dargah in 2012
 kyon khaas he jafar kii dargah?aakhri mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar kii maut 1862 main burma (ab myanmar) kii tatkaaleen rajdhani rangoon (ab yangun) kii ek jail main hui thi, lekin unki dargah 132 saal baad 1994 main bani
 Every brick of this dargah smells of history of the life of the last emperor
 is dargah main mahilaon or purushon ke liye alag-alag prarthana karne kii jagah bani he
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the nominal emperor sitting on the throne of Delhi under British rule
 bahadur shah jafar ko haalanki ek badshaah ke taur par kam or kavi evam ghazal lekhak ke taur par zyada janaa jaataa he
 Later film songs were made on many of his songs
 unki dargah duniya kii mashhoor or aitihaasik dargahon main gini jaati he
 Why was Zafar nominated the title of Emperor? After the death of his father Akbar Shah II in September 1837, he became the throne
 akbar shah dwitiya kavi hriday jafar ko sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa mughalon kaa shashan nahin saunpna chaahate the
 By the time of the reign of Saundaryanuragi Bahadur Shah Zafar, in the same way, only Delhi i

 Shahjahanbad was left to rule the Delhi Sultanate
 1857 ke vidroh ne jafar ko banaaya aazaadee kii sipaahi1857 main britishon ne takreeban puure bharat par kabja jamaa liya tha
 The rebellious soldiers and king-emperors, stung by the British invasion, needed a central leadership, which showed them in Bahadur Shah Zafar
 bahadur shah jafar ne bhi britishon ke khilaaf ladaai main netritv sweekaar kar liya
 But 82-year-old Shah Zafar eventually lost the battle and had to spend the last year of his life in British captivity
 bahadur shah jafar kii giraftaar mughal samrajya ke ant ke rup main saamne ai
 The Mughal Empire, which lasted more than 400 years, was now over
 aalaa darje ke shaayar the bahadur shah jafaratbiyat se kavi hriday bahadur shah jafar shero-shaayari ke mureed the or unke darbar ke do sheersh shaayar mohammad gaalib or jock aaj bhi shaayaron ke liye adarsh hai
 Zafar himself was an excellent poet
 dard main duube unke sheron main maanav jivan kii gahari sachchaaiyaan or bhaawanaaon kii duniya basati thi
 While in captivity of the British in Rangoon, he wrote a lot of ghazals
 bataur kaidi unhen kalam tak nahin di gai thi, lekin sufi sant kii oopaadhi vaale badshaah jafar ne jali hui tiliyon se diwaar par gajalen likhin
 "the day is over, the evening is over, the feet of the fellows will sleep in Kunj-e-mazar" Later, he wanted to be buried near Qutbuddin Bakhtiar's Dargah in Mehrauli, Delhi
 unhone iske liye do gaj jagah kii bhi nishandehi kar rakhi thi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the morning of November 7, 1862, in British captivity in Kiaberma, silently buried by Zafar without reclamation
 unhen usee din jail ke paas hi shwadagon pagoda ke najadik dafna diya gaya
 Not only this, a bamboo fence was erected around his grave and the grave was covered with leaves
 british chaar dashak se hindustan par raaj karne vaale mughalon ke aakhri badshaah ke antim sanskaar ko zyada taam-jhaam nahin dena chaahate the
 Anyway, for the Muslims of Burma it was not a death of a king but a common death
 us samay jafar ke antim sanskaar kii dekharekh kar rahe british adhikari davis ne bhi likhaa he ki jafar ko dafnaate vakt koi 100 log vahaan maujuud the or yah waisi hi bheed thi, jaise ghuddaud dekhne vaali yaa sadar bazaar ghoomane vaali
 An underground tomb was unearthed during an excavation to lay the foundation stone of a memorial hall in 1991, 132 years after Zafar's death

 At a depth of 5 feet, the emblem and remains of Emperor Zafar were found, which, after investigation, confirmed that it was from Zafar

 The Central Government has justified its decision to create the National Judicial Appointments Commission, or NJAC, for the appointment of judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court
 supreme court main paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth main sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne daleel di he ki sansad dwaara vivek se liye gaye faisle par nyaayik samiksha nahin ho sakati or sansad apane faisle ke liye jawaab dene ke liye baadhya nahin he
 On behalf of the Central Government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi argued in the Constitution Bench that the manner in which the Ordinance 124 of the Constitution was understood
 usase samvidhan nirmaataa dow
 Ambedkar's soul will also be troubled, because there is no talk of collegium system anywhere in the constitution
 haalanki is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi samvidhan peeth main justise chelmeshwar ne kaha ki sarkaar is nae system ko isliye nahin laai kyonki dow
 Ambedkar's soul is disturbed, rather there is some other reason behind it
 rohtagi ne kaha ki nyaaypalika kii aazaadee jajon kii niyukti ke baad hi shuru hoti he or nae system main jajon kii hi pramukhataa he
 If two out of three judges question the appointment of a person, then he cannot be appointed
 yachikakarta kaa ye kahana ki is system se nyaaypalika kii aazaadee main khalal hoga, ye baat kisi bhi tarah se thik nahin he
 He said that the collegium system of 1993 was formed due to the attitude of the government at that time as the government also tried to surround the judiciary
 ye sunwaayee aage bhi jari rahegi
 In this case, the constitution bench has also raised many questions on the central government in the past
 tippaniyan Earlier, the court had asked the government to explain how the new system is better than the collegium system and this will not disturb the independence of the judiciary
 agar sarkaar court ko santusht kar detii he to court is system ko maan legi
 Earlier, after the formation of the commission, many petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court and it has been said that this commission should be abolished
 centre sarkaar ne pehle daleel di thi ki 1993 main supreme court kii nau jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne colegium system banaaya tha lihaaja is maamle ko bhi 9 yaa 11 jajon kii bench ko bheja janaa chahie, lekin court ne is maang ko thukraa diya tha
 During the hearing in the five-judge Constitution Bench in the Supreme Court, the Central Government has argued that judicial review by Parliament cannot be judicially reviewed and Parliament is not bound to respond to its decision
 centre sarkaar kii ore se atorni general mukul rohtagi ne samvidhan peeth main bahes karte hue ki kaha ki jis tarah samvidhan ke adhyadesh 124 ko samajha gaya
 From him constitution maker Dr
 ambedkar kii aatma bhi pareshaan hogi, kyonki samvidhan main kahin bhi colegium system kii baat nahin he
 However, in the Constitution Bench hearing the case, Justice Chelameswar said that the government did not bring this new system because Dr
 ambedakar kii aatma pareshaan he, balki iske peeche kuch or kaaran he
 Rohatgi said that the independence of the judiciary starts only after the appointment of the judges and the judges have prominence in the new system
 agar teen main se do jaj kisi vyakti kii niyukti par sawaal uthaate hai to uski niyukti nahin ho sakati
 The petitioner's statement that this system will disturb the independence of the judiciary is not correct in any way
 unhone kaha ki 1993 kaa colegium system us vakt kii sarkaar ke ravaie kii vajah se bana kyonki us vakt sarkaar ne nyaaypalika ko bhi gherne kii koshish kii thi
 This hearing will continue
 is maamle main samvidhan peeth pehle bhi centre sarkaar par kai sawaal uthaa chuki he
 The comments isse pehle court ne sarkaar se poocha tha ki wo bataae ki nayaa system kis tarah colegium system se behatar he or isse nyaaypalika kii aazaadee main khalal nahin padegaa
 If the government satisfies the court, then the court will accept this system
 isse pehle ayog ke banane ke baad supreme court main kai yachikaayen daakhil kii gai hai or kaha gaya he ki is ayog ko khatm kiya jaae
 The central government had earlier argued that the constitution bench of nine judges of the Supreme Court had framed the collegium system in 1993, so the matter should also be referred to a bench of 9 or 11 judges, but the court turned down the demand
 haalanki is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi samvidhan peeth main justise chelmeshwar ne kaha ki sarkaar is nae system ko isliye nahin laai kyonki dow
 Ambedkar's soul is disturbed, rather there is some other reason behind it

 Press Council chairman Justice Katju and BJP leader Arun Jaitley are stunned
 arun jetali to katju se is kadar khafa hai unhone unhen press council of india (PCI) se hataae jane kii maang kar di he
 Jaitley has accused him of favoring non-congress states
 haalanki justise katju ne safai dete hue kaha ki unhone kabhi koi pakshpaat nahin kiya auki abtak jo bhi kaha he us par wo kaayam hai
 Is Justice Katju not entitled to continue as Chairman of Press Council of India? Does Justice Katju have political bias? Has Justice Katju targeted non-congress states? These questions have arisen from the allegations of senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley
 pichley dinon justise katju ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke khilaaf ek akhbaar main artical kya likhaa, bijepi bifer gayi
 Arun Jaitley demanded resignation, accusing Justice Katju of bias
 jetali ne bijepi kii website par lekh likh kar maang kii he ki yaa to justise katju khud press council of india ke chairman pad se istipha de den yaa phir unhen hataa diya jaae
 Jaitley has alleged that Justice Katju's article written in the newspaper is completely inspired by politics
 aarope ye bhi madha kii wo unalogon ko khush karne ke liye gaiyr congressi rajyon par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai jinhone unhen ye ahm jimmedaari saunpi he
 After Jaitley's letter, the entire BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that why Justice Katju sees mistakes in non-congress states only
 unki nazren bihar, gujarat or pashchim bengal se aage kyon nahin jaatin
 Even after all the attacks of BJP, Justice Katju has remained on his stand
 unka daawa he ki unhone kabhi kuch bhi galat nahin kaha or naa hi koi pakshpaat kiya he
 The accusations of Jaitley and BJP were baseless and tried to express themselves objectively, citing the Maharashtra government's criticism of the Facebook case
 darasal katju ne ek akhbaar main likhe apane lekh main narendra modi kii aalochana karte hue desh ke logon se apil kii thi ki ve soch-samajhakar pradhanmantri chune
 He had even held Modi guilty of the Gujarat riots
 isse pehle justise katju kii adhyakshata main press council of india ne ek report jari kii thi jisamen bihar kii nitish kumaar sarkaar par bhi press kii swatantraaa kuchalane ke aarope lagaae the
 Obviously, all these things and the attack of Justice Katju is not embracing BJP
 nazren 2014 chunaav par he, sawaal chhavi kaa he
 The BJP knows that the talk of the Chairman of the Press Council of India can damage the image of the party and the alliance, perhaps that is why the BJP has also directly attacked Katju's image

 Rajnath said, 'maybe some incidents have happened but can't we ignore them? There have been incidents and before the year 2002 there have been 13 thousand communal riots in the country

 samajasevi anna hajaare ne ek baar phir ramlila maidan se bhrashtrachaar mukt bharat or kisaanon ke haq ke liye anshan kaa aagaaj kiya he
 Ramlila Maidan has once again resonated with slogans of patriotism like Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 2011 ke baad ab 2018 main anna hajaare ne nae sire se satyagrah shuru kar diya he
 The difference is that in 2011, Anna's movement was against the Congress government and this time the BJP is against the government
 desh ke rajdhani main anna hajaare ko is baar kitna sarmathan miltaa he, is par sabaki najar he
 At the same time, support in Anna's village Ralegan Siddhi seems to be doubling
 piem modi kaa jalaayaa putalaandolan ke pehle hi din, ralegan siddhi main gaanv waalon ne piem narendra modi kaa putala jalaayaa
 The villagers have alleged that slogans were raised against the Modi government in Ralegan Siddhi, when the BJP government started stopping vehicles coming to Delhi's Ramlila Maidan to support it
 saath hi dhamkee bhi di gai ki agar jald upaay nahin kiya to andolan or tej karenge
 The public came out on the road in support, he said that the BJP government should remember that in 2011 the Congress movement tried to suppress the movement as much as the Anna movement
 andolan ko samarthan dene janata sadak par utarane lagi thi
 This time the demand for fast unto death is the implementation of Swaminathan Commission for the benefit of the strong Lokpal, Public Commissioner and farmers
 anna ko sarmathan dene ke liye desh bhar se log dilli pahunchane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you that when Anna Hazareramalila sat for the movement on the ground, the villagers also sat on a hunger strike for a day
