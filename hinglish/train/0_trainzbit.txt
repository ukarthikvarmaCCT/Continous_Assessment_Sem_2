 The circular was reissued in 1975 and 1980

 shubh mangal saavdhaan film ke ek drishy main shaadi ke thik pehle mudit (ayushmaan khurana) or sugandha (bhoomi pednekar) ek kamare main band ho jate hai
 Outside, all the people on the boy-girl side bet on something 'happening'
 thodi der baad baahar aane par mudit kahata he, ''ho gaya'' jabaki sugandha kahati he, ''nahin hua''
 Mudit then tells Sugandha that "ya haa ho ho gaya"
 sugandha bhi muskaraati he or saare log jhum uthte hai
 Similarly, in a scene in the film, Guddu (karthik Aryan) and Rashmi (kriti Sanon) stay in a rented house for a live-in relationship, then Guddu's bed has several flavors under the pillow before Rashmi arrives at the bed
 Seeing the condom jumps happily
 donon drishyon main baat sex kii hone ke baavjood lekhak-nirdeshak ne ise itane gudgudane vaale andaaj main rachaa he ki cinemahal main darshak asahaj mahasoos karne kii bajaae hansate hai
 Both films earned a lot at the box office
 vaise bhartiya samaaj main liv-in ko manyata nahin he or napunsakata par khulkar baat karne kii to baat hi chhod den
 Filmmakers also served such adult content with tactic among the family audience
 luka chhipi ke nirmaataa dinesh vijan ise edlt yaa bold content kii bajaae ''nae jamaane kaa content'' kehete hai
 "all these things were already happening but we were afraid to put them in the film
 abhi himmat dikhaai to bijness main bhi kamyaabi mil rahi he
 "shubh Mangal Savdhan's screenwriter Hitesh Kevalya captures it in a different way," the audience is being made more comfortable with adult content
 ab ye gandi baat nahin rahi
 We present sexual matters in such a way that even parents feel that children are not seeing anything wrong with them
 '' isi hafte relies sex aadhaarit kamedi film khandaani shafakhana kii nirdeshak shilpi dasgupta bhi aise content kii vakaalat main kahati hai, ''internet ke jamaane main sab kuch khulaa hua he
 Now there should be no communication gap on sex
 cinema ke madhyam se bhi pragati kii lahar aa rahi he
 After all, cinema is a mirror of society
 ''edlt content vaali hindi filmein pehle bhi banati thim or uske darshak bhi vayask hua karte the
 But now the way of presenting that fun has changed
 aisi filmein ab paariwarik darshakon ko khinchakar laane main kaamyaab ho rahi hai or banane waalon ko kamai kaa nayaa bazaar mil gaya he
 Till yesterday, the topics or issues that were in such a story were sold in the name of bold or sex
 ab ve gudgudate hasya kii shakl main aa rahe hai, jinamein samvaad bhi aam bolchaal vaale hote hai
 It is not a dirty thing even for children
 sensor board se you yaa yue certificate mil jaataa he
 Sensitive screenwriters have a big role in it
 shilpi ke shabdon main, ''gautam mehara ne khandaani shafakhana kii script jis tarah se likhi he us par sonakshi sinha jaisi heroin ne na sirf vishwaas jataayaa balki ve sex par baat bhi karti hai
 In cinema, impotence, live in relationship, menstruation, secret disease or homosexuality are no longer taboo
 skulon main sambhav na ho saki yon shiksha ab cinema ke jariye aaj kii yuva peedi ko mil rahi he
 Producers are also taking risks for such films
 vijan kamasutra, hindi medium, stri, lucatipi jaisi filmein bana chuke hai
 Shoojit Sircar made a classic film like Vicky Donor
 akshay kumaar ne bhi toilet or pedman jaisi filmon ke jariye jaagrukta paidaa karne kii koshish kii
 "hitesh makes it clear that we have to tell the youth, they learn to differentiate between right and wrong
 or lekhakon ke liye yah vyaktigat jimmedaari kii tarah he
 "we have the ability to influence the minds and minds of millions of viewers
 yah aujaar hamaare liye jinda hand grenade kii tarah hai
 We have to handle very responsibly
 edlt content ke saath kamedi likhnaa aasaan nahin
 The success of Vicky Donor, made on a subject like sperm donor, started the era of films on such bold subjects
 samvedansheel filmkaaron ne apane aas-paas se vishay uthaakar sine premiyon ke saamne parosa to unhen paariwarik darshak mil gaye
 Sometimes films like Gupta Gyan and Kamasutra were introduced in the name of sex education but they could not become family films for the audience
 aaj cinema main gupt gyaan kii baton ko na sirf sahajata se bataaya ja rahaa he balki aam darshak bhi in par parivaar ke bich charchaa karne se hichkichaate nahin
 Today's young generation is considering adult content as a part of life and seeing the padman has started understanding the hygiene of the pad
 shubh mangal saavdhaan main napunsakata par jor diya gaya to lucatipi main liv in relationships or badhai ho main jawan bacchon ke hote hue bhi ek adhed stri garbhvatee hokar sharmasaar nahin hui
 When i saw a girl, it felt like a natural love story of lesbian
 kahani-2 main bal yon shoshan par focus kiya gaya jo ghar-ghar kii kahani he or zyaadaatar yah sach chaar deewari se baahar nahin aa paata
 The authors of such films have a keen eye on those parts of society that were not seen before from a family perspective
 usamen sex hi dikhataa tha
 And he was also filmed in the same way that he was adult as a subject and also vulgar
 lekin aaj ke daur kii aisi filmon ko ab darshak bharpoor manoranjan ke liye dekhte hai or uske content par dil kholkar baat bhi karte hai
 Jokingly, our audience is also becoming aware with such content
 mana ja saktaa he ki cinema bhi apana saamaajik daayitv puraa kar rahaa he
 Here the business of such films has encouraged the filmmakers
 in filmon ke bajet ke mukaable kamai kai guna zyada hoti he
 Filmmaker Anand L
 Rai of Shubh Mangal Savdhan is now making Shubh Mangal more careful
 yah dhara 377 par aadhaarit he
 This topic came to Anand's mind when the Central Government legalized gay relations
 hamaare samaaj main banjhapan ek badi samasya he
 Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor are in Good News being made on this subject
 yah film ivief takanic par baat karti he
 Srinarayan Singh, who made electricity on the electricity bill problem in rural areas, is now working for a film on surrogate mother
 shubh mangal zyada saavdhaan ke patakatha lekhak hitesh hi hai
 To do justice to its subject, so for the first time they are also directing it
 ve kehete hai, ''yah film bahut jaruri he
 Article 377 removal work is a step in the right direction
 acchhee baat yah he ki aam janata main is vishay ko ab rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Now it can be discussed
 ham bhi koshish kar rahe hai ki sahajata ke saath baat kah den or hamaari baat aam janata tak manoranjak dhang se pahunch jaae
 There should be a positivity about all these things
 ''is tarah kii filmon ke abhinaytaon kii soch bhi sakaaratmak rahati he
 Ayushman Khurana, who plays a gay man in Shubh Mangal More Aware, talks in favor of this fraternity
 khandaani shafakhana ke badshaah bhi kehete hai ki sex par khulkar baat honi chahie

 centurian ke maidan par south africa ne team india ko 135 ranon se haraakar teen maichon kii test siries main 2-0 se ajey badhat bana lee he
 Simultaneously, the dream of the Virat Brigade, which came with the dream of a 10th consecutive series win in the test format, was shattered
 itnaa hi nahin team india africa main 25 saal baad test siries jeet kar itihaas rachana chaahati thi, lekin captain or team management ke kuch galat faislon kii vajah se yah sambhav nahin ho paaya
 The captain and team management conducted three experiments in this match, but all three proved to be failures
 1
 Rahul replacing Dhawan: In the Centurion Test, Virat Kohli gave an opportunity to Lokesh Rahul by dropping Shikhar Dhawan, thinking that he would score runs but his performance was worse than Shikhar Dhawan
 rahul ne centurian test kii donon pariyon main milakar sirf 14 ran hi banaae hai
 Lokesh Rahul's poor shot in the second innings raises the question of his place
 2
 Keeping Rahane out of the playing eleven: Team India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane was not played by captain Kohli in two consecutive matches and Rohit Sharma was given a chance in the playing eleven despite an embarrassing performance
 yah aisa faisla tha jo team india ko bahut mahangaa padaa
 Rahane's record on the soil of South Africa is not hidden from anyone
 nishchit rup se is match main team india ko rahane kii kami khali he
 3
 riddhimaan saaha se zyada parthiv patel par bharosa:captain viraat kohli ne riddhimaan saaha kii wicketcaping skill se zyada parthiv patel kii ballebaaji par bharosa dikhaaya
 The decision to include Parthiv Patel in the playing eleven in place of specialist wicketkeeper Saha was a complete flop
 parthiv patel ne apane ballebaaji pradarshan se to niraash kiya hi saath main wicket ke peeche bhi do kaich tapakaae
 Team India had a good chance to win this Test series, as their fast bowlers have all outed South Africa twice in both matches in the series so far
 lekin ballebaajon ke flop sho ne us par pani pherane kaa kaam kiya he

 central tibetan administration (sitie) ke adhyaksh or nirvasit tibeti sarkaar ke pradhanmantri lobsang saange ne kaha he ki china bigadel bade bhai kii tarah harakatein karata rahata he
 In a special conversation with India Today, Sangay has discussed many important issues related to India, China and Tibet
 aapako bataa den ki bharat sarkaar ne haal hi main ek circular jari kiya, jisaki vajah se nai dilli main hone vaala kaarykram 'thank you india' dharmashala main shift ho gaya tha
 The event was to take place on the 60th birth anniversary of the Tibetan spiritual master, the Dalai Lama
 saange ne kaha ki vah is faisle kii samvedansheeltaa ko samajhate hai
 On this matter, Sangay said, "yes, we have seen the circular and we understand these situations
 dalai lamas ne hameshaa kaha he ki ham bharat samet kisi ke liye bhi koi bhi asuvidha yaa pareshaani khadi nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 We want good relations with all our neighbors including India and China
 isliye agar china kii taraf se koi pareshaani khadi kii ja rahi he to hamen kaarykram ke shift hone se koi dikkat nahin he
 We know that China is quite sensitive on this matter
 'saange ne kaha, 'china bigadel bade bhai kii tarah vyavhaar karata he
 It is always sensitive
 ham kuch bhi karen, kahin bhi jaaen, kuch bhi kahen china hameshaa is par bayaan detaa he
 They keep complaining to the Government of India
 isliye ham bharat sarkaar ke circular ko samajhate hai
 However, the Indian government has made it clear that it will not change its policy on Tibet and the Dalai Lama
 aapako bataa den ki bharat ke cabinet sachiv ne sarkaar ke sabhi padaadhikariyon ko dalai lamas ke kaarykram se dur rahane ko kaha tha
 On 22 February, he had quoted a letter from the Foreign Secretary, saying that all government officials should abstain from this program in view of China's sensitivity
 iske baad dilli main hone vaale kaarykram 'thank you india' ko dharmashala shift kar diya gaya tha
 However, in addition to the Government of India, representatives of several political parties also participated and expressed their support to Tibet
 lobsang saange ne kaha he, 'thank you india main bharat sarkaar kii ore se mantri mahesh sharma ji or bijepi kii ore se mere dost rammadhav ji or shanta kumaar ji, himachal sarkaar ke mantri or congress kii ore se satyavrath chaturvedi aae
 The real thing is that all the important people were involved in this program
 'unhone kaha ki is tarah ke kaarykram or saanskrithik mahotsav na kevaldalai lamas ke sangharshako saamne rakhte hai, balki jamini vaastaviktaa bhi bataate hai
 Sangay said, "the Chinese government claims that it has transformed Tibet into a paradise of socialism, but the Freedom House Index states that Syria has the least independence and in this case Tibet is the second
 south sudan or eritrea kaa number bhi iske baad aata he
 This means violations of human rights, destruction of the environment and cultural repression continue under the leadership of Xi Jinping
 ' It is said that exams throw away the sound of good
 aisa hi kuch in dinon bollywood kii ek badi heroin ke saath bhi ho rahaa he
 They do not sleep at night and all the time they think about exams
 ye heroin or koi nahin balki kangana ranot hai
 Kangana is currently in New York to study screen play script writing, and is going to have her exam soon, and this has caused Kangna to lose her nights sleep
 kangana ko sabhi unki patibaddhta or samarpan ke liye jaanate he, jab ve koi task haath main leti he ve puure lagan se karti hai
 Kangana's classes go on throughout the day and because of this, Kangana has to stay awake throughout the night and read to prepare for her exams
 satara main ensipi ummidavaar kii jeetsatara main barish main bhing kar sharad pavaar ne diya tha bhaashanrashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne 19 oktober ko satara main musaladhar barish ke dauraan ek chunavi raily kii thi jisamen loksabhaa upachunaav main apni party ke ummidavaar ke liye unhone vot maanga tha
 His photo and video of him campaigning during rains had gone viral
 78 saal ke sharad pavaar kii ye mehnat rang laai he
 The NCP has defeated the BJP here in the Lok Sabha by-election
 loksabhaa upachunaav ke liye ensipi ne shrinivas patil ko vidhansabha seat ke liye deepak sahebrav pavaar ko maidan main utaara tha
 Srinivas Patil defeated Udayan Raje Bhosle of BJP by more than 80 thousand votes
 satara loksabhaa seat par chunaav ke thik pehle udayanraaje bhosle ne ensipi kaa saath chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya tha, lekin yah daanv udayan raaje bhosle ko ulta padaa he
 Let us know that Udayan Raje is a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji and the BJP hoped that he would prove to be the trump card for the party in the elections but this does not appear to be happening in the trends
 19 oktober ko satara main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan badalon kii garaj ke bich sharad pavaar ne kaha tha ki, 'yah ensipi ke liye varun raja kaa aashirwad he
 This will create a miracle in the state and this miracle will begin on October 21
 mujhe iskaa vishwaas he
 'satara is an important seat for the NCP, where the Lok Sabha by-elections and assembly elections are held simultaneously
 donon jagahon par ensipi ko apane purv diggaj netaaon se hi chunauti mili he
 Explain that due to bad weather that day the party leaders were thinking about canceling the rally
 tabhi musaladhar barish se bina ghabaraae sharad pavaar manch par chadh gaye or sambodhan shuru kar diya
 In the meantime, he had fiercely targeted the Bharatiya Janata party-shiv Sena government of the Center and the state
 musaladhar barish se pehle manch par maujuud party ke varisht netaa shuruyaat main teetar-bitar ho gaye the
 Again in the midst of the torrential rains, Sharad Pawar started supporting him on the attack on BJP

 The ACB has asked for the names of the officers watching 1031 and said that we will take legal action
 asibi is maamle par exiaar bhi darj kar sakati he
 Before regretting that the ACB has lost control, Kejriwal said that during his one-year tenure, he is most sorry for the fact that the anti-corruption Branch is not in his purview
 AAP sarkaar ke 49 dinon ke kaarykaal ko yaad karte hue kejariwal ne kaha, 'un 49 dinon main hamane dilli ke andar asibi ke jariye kareeb 50 adhikariyon par karrwai kii thi
 The policemen had stopped taking bribes
 lekin beete saal 8 june ko centre sarkaar nemukesh meenako asibi chif banaakar control apane haath main le liya

 The Union Petroleum Ministry has demanded a reduction in the excise duty on petrol and diesel in the upcoming budget 2018-19
 petroleum mantralay main sutron ne news agency riter se kaha he ki exise duty main katautee se desh main petrol or dijal kii lagaataar badhati keemton par lagaam lagane kaa mauka milegaa
 Significantly, during the recent Gujarat assembly elections, Prime Minister Modi had to face pressure on the continuous increase in the prices of petrol and diesel
 vahiin maujuuda samay main vaishvik kaarnon se crude oil kii keemton main lagaataar ijapha dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Due to which many experts believe that the prices of crude oil in the international market can once again cross $ 100 per barrel
 jab 150 dollar pahunch gai thi crude kii keemtvaishvik sanstha orgenigeshan for iconomic kooparation and deveopment (oisidi) kii bhavishyavaanee he ki maujuuda vaishvik aarthik sthiti main 2020 tak crude oil kii keemat 270 dollar prati bairal tak ja sakati he
 Significantly, in 2008, crude oil was at an all-time high of $ 145 per barrel
 vahiin 2015 or 2016 ke dauraan khadi deshon main jari vivaad or china samet vikasshil deshon main maang kii kami ke chalate crude oil kii keemat 30 dollar prati bairal ke str par pahunch gai
 Read this: Will the Modi government challenge the Rs 100-liter petrol in 2019? The oecd's prediction is that economies like China and India could increase the demand for fuel to gain momentum in the coming years
 bina 100 dollar crude ke bhi 100 rupee litre hoga petrol?bharat main petrol kii keemat 100 rupee kaa paar jane ke liye jaruri nahin ki crude oil is str ko chhue
 For the last three years, the price of crude in the country and the tax being charged by the Central and State Governments can bring the price of petrol to 100 rupees at the same time once the crude oil touches the 2014 level i
e

 This was done because the taxes levied by the states on petrol and diesel form a major part of their annual revenue

 ) If your hearing capacity is getting weaker, then your food may be responsible for this
 ho saktaa he ki aap apane khaane main paryaapt aayran kii maatra nahin le rahe hai
 Yes, researchers have claimed in a recent study that a person's lack of hearing capacity may be weakened due to iron deficiency
 bas do ghunt main milegi manachaahi sundarataayah adhyayan pencilvenia state univircity ke shodhakartaaon ne kiya he
 During the research, 3 lakh people were studied
 visheshgyon ke mutabik vaishvik str par 30 fisadi log anaemic hai
 That is, there is anemia in 30 percent of the world's population
 isaki pramukh vajahon main aayran kii kami sabase ahm he
 But during the research, experts found that iron deficiency is related to deafness in addition to anemia
 yrandefisiency anemia (IDA) hamaare sunne kii kshamta ko bhi prabhavit karti he
 That is, iron deficiency can also cause deafness
 iske saath hi kaan kii bich vaali haddi main bhi isse samasya aa sakati he
 During the course of the research, hearing loss was found to be poor in such participants who had iron deficiency
 jabaki jin pratibhaagiyon ke sharir main aayran kaa str saamaanya tha, unamem bahrepan kaa khatra nahin dekha gaya
 Researchers said hearing loss from iron deficiency can also affect the brain
 agar koi vyakti zyada dinon tak aayran kii kami vaali sthiti main bana rahata he to uske sochane samajhane kii kshamta bhi isse prabhavit ho sakati he
 At the same time, it can prove to be unsuccessful in taking decisions
 aayran kii kami kii vajah se thakaan, pili twachaa or nakhun, kamajori, chakkar aana, sir main dard aadi jaisi pareshaaniyaan bhi hoti hai
 According to the new study, green leafy vegetables, brown rice and meat keep a person from deafness
 ab chikangunia se nahin hogi maut, aa gai vaxyyran ke liye inhen bhi shaamil karen apni khuraaq main :1
 Green leafy vegetables contain a lot of iron
 sardiyon main aasaani se mil jate hai
 Include these in your diet
 2
 Eat lentils daily
 khaastaur se kaali daalen yaa kaali masoor daal
 They contain rich iron and protein
 3
 In the cold, you have breakfast of oats in the morning
 jayee main aayran or fibre hota he
 4
 aayran ke liye tofu bhi kha sakate hai
 It is also found in high amounts of iron as well as protein
 5
 Dried zardalu and beans such as rajma, gram etc

 inhen khaane main shaamil kar aap aayran kii kami, khun kii kami or bahraapan teenon ko dur sakate hai

 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has raised questions on the Election Commission by tweeting through her Twitter account
 mayawati kaa kahana he ki supreme court kii yah santushti kaaphi mahatvapurn he ki chunaav ayog utana laachaar va kamjor nahin he jitna vah apane aapako sabit kar rahaa tha
 In the entire tweet, Mayawati wrote, "the satisfaction of the Supreme Court is very important that the Election Commission is not as helpless and weak as it was proving itself
" lekin is tathy va aamdharna kii sahi jaanch va parakh honi baaki he ki ayog vaaki swatantraaa va nishpakshta se kaam kar rahaa he evam kendra ke aage natmastak nahin he?''mananeey supreme court kii yah santushti kaaphi mahatvapurn he ki chunaav ayog utana laachaar va kamjor nahin he jitna vah apane aapako sabit kar rahaa tha
 But it remains to be properly investigated and verified the fact that the Commission is indeed acting with independence and impartiality and is not bowing down to the Center? Mayawati also targeted PM Modi and said, "every type of election Apart from unrestrained allegations, BJP leaders and PM Modi's speech has been relentless, such as the allegation that they keep abusing them is very indecent and indecisive
 mahila sammaan se jude maamalon main bhi bijepi kii bhoomika acchhee nahin rahi he
 "apart from this, Mayawati also tweeted another, in which she taunted the BJP," The opposition should not exceed the limits of decency in commenting on each other in spite of many kinds of provocations
 isse bijepi ko apni kamajori chhipaane va logon ko bargalane kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Anyway, the Commission's grip on the ruling party will be strict only then public confidence will be created
 ''mayawati ne ek or twit karke piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he

 After this, his brother Sankha complained to him in the panchayat, where both his hands were amputated as punishment 
 kehete hai likhita ne baad main kanipakkam ke paas sthit isi nadi main apane haath daale the, jiske baad uske haath phir se jud gaye
 Since then, this river has been named Bahuda, which means the common man's hand
 ye is nadi kaa mahatv hi he ki kanipakkam mandir ko bahuda nadi se naam se bhi janaa jaataa he

 He would have been killed if Osama bin Ladenbullet had been in a proof jacket during the American commando attack
 agar wo bina kapadon ke hota yani usne koi kapade naa pahan rakhe hote to shaayad uski jaan batch jaati
 Perhaps the commandos would have arrested him alive and taken him to America
 par badakismati se osama ne us vakt kapade pahan rakhe the
 The clothes that scared America
 kapadaa bana laden kaa dushmankapadaa insaan ko pahchaan detaa he, izzat bakhshata he lekin kya aapane suna he ki kapadaa kisi kii jaan kaa dushman ban jaae? shaayad yah ajeeb lage lekin ye sach he duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi osama bin laden kii jaan isi kapade ne lee
 Had Osama been naked, he could have survived
 vaise to osama america navy ke cills team 6 ke commando aaparishan main maaraa gaya
 But even after this operation Osama could survive
 basharte wo bina kapade ke hota yani nanga hota
 Do you know why? The US intelligence agency CIA had given clear instructions to the Kommandoz who carried out Operation Jarenimo Ikiya that osama-bin-laden should be caught alive only
 jab wo bagaiyr kapade ke sarender kare ko taiyaar ho
 That means she is completely naked
 siie ke diarector leone peneta kii maane to unhen osama par zaraa bhi bharosa nahin tha
 They did not want to give him a chance to speak anything
 unhen andeshaa tha ki khoonkhaar osama ke kapadon main bam chupa ho saktaa he
 He may be wearing an jacket with an ID
 kaaade ke andar koi hathiyaar chupa ho saktaa he
 And in the event of being caught, he could become a suicide bomb and blow up everything around him
 ek may kii raat jab america ne abtabad kii is haveli par dhaava bolaa, us vakt osama pathaani suut main so rahaa tha
 After a bit of trouble, that time also went when the unarmed Osama had come under the commando's target
 magar kapade utaarna to dur wo unke kabje main aane kaa bhi virodh kar rahaa tha
 American commandos did not have enough time to argue with him
 lihaaja commandos ne bina vakt ganvaae or koi khatra mol liye sidhe use maar daalane kaa hi faisla kiya
 And then he is killed the same way a suicide bomber is killed
 bina koi mauka die cills team 6 ke conmado ne osama ke sir main do goliyaan daag deen 
 It is called a double trap
 Osama had already announced that he would prefer to die rather than be caught when he was surrounded by an American army
 khud osama bin laden ke bodyguard rahe nasir al bahiri ne bhi is baat kii tasdik kii he
 According to Nasir al-bahiri, in August 1998, when the American attack was taking place, one day Laden fired two bullets from his revolver and gave him a strict instruction that if he was surrounded by American enemies, he would shoot him in the head
 
 shaayad jinda pakadaa janaa osama ko manjuur nahin tha
 Going to American jails, Osama considered himself insensitive
 kapade ke baad ab baat kothi kii
 The same kothi in which Osama was killed and which many people also call Osama's mansion
 teen manzili kothi main osama paanch saal pehle ghusaa tha
 And once he entered this kothi, he did not come out of the kothi even once
 kothi ke andar bhi wo sirf do kamaron main hi khud ko kaid rakhata tha
 Pakistan finally accepted on Thursday that Osam bin Laden had been living in this mansion in Abbottabad for the last five years
 or ye haveli chah saal pehle khaas uske chupane ke liye hi banaai gai thi
 On Thursday, the Pakistan government called a few select editors and gave them complete information about the developments following Operation Osama
 pakistan ke mutabik ek may kii raat ko hue oparation kii jaankaree unhen usee raat tab mili jab helicopter ke krash hone or goliyon kii awaajen sunai deen
 But by the time the local police reached the spot, American commandos had flown in from there in another helicopter
 iske baad jab police haveli ke andar daakhil hui to vahaan haveli ke ek hisse main aag lagi hui thi
 While inside the mansion, many children and women were frightened and submerged in separate rooms
 tab tak khud police ko bhi pataa nahin tha ki ye osama bin laden kii haveli he
 But then when the operation was reported to Islamabad from the White House late at night, then the Pakistan Army and Pak Intelligence Agency IIS came into action and immediately the top officers were rushed to Abbottabad
 paak sarkaar ne sampadakon ko bataaya ki haveli main maujuud tamaam logon ko sabase pehle aspataal le jaaya gaya
 After this, when he was interrogated, it was found that three of them were Osama's sons and a daughter
 inhen main se ek yaman kii rahane vaali osama kii bevaa ne paak afasaron ko bataaya ki osama paanch saal pehle afghanistan se abtabad kii is haveli main aayaa tha
 And since then he was living here
 in paanch saalon main ghar se baahar nikalnaa to dur wo ghar ke andar bhi sirf do kamaron main simata rahata tha
 And both these rooms were on the third floor
 osama kii is bevaa ke mutabik osama kabhi compound main yaa neeche bhi nahin jaataa tha
 He never even went to the open terrace
 haveli ke andar bhi osama ke kamare yani teesri manzil par jane kii harek ko ijaajat nahin thi
 Only her wives and children could go to her room
 paak sarkaar ne ye bhi bataaya ki sa vakt commando ne haveli par dhaava bolaa tha tab osama kii teenon biviyaan pehali auki duusari manzil par thim
 While her daughter of 12 years was with Osama on the second floor
 or usee beti ke saamne osama ko goli maari gai
 How the US Navy SEAL commandos killed Osama on the night of May 1, the world has come to know
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki osama ke khatme ke is oparation main ek bejubaan jaanbaaj ne bhi behad ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi? ji haa
 The team that went to kill Osama was also accompanied by a dog
 or isi kute kii badaulat commando bedadak osama ke thikaane main ghus paae the
 On the night of May 1, the US Navy SEAL commands were heading towards their biggest mission
 khabar mili thi ki america kaa sabase bada dushman pakistan ke abtabad ilaake ke ek makaan main chupa he
 Prior to this attack, the commandos of Navy SEAL Team Six had trained hard for a month
 lekin phir unhen pukhta taur par ye nahin maaloom tha ki unke hamale kaa dushman kaisaa jawaab denge
 Preparations were big because Samana was the biggest face of terror from Osama bin Laden
 america kii das saal puraani talash puri hone vaali thi, isliye america commando koi chook nahin chaahate the
 The dangers in this mission were many
 osama ne apane thikaane main kitne asalhe or barood chupa rakhe the kisi ko nahin maaloom
 It was not known what kind of retaliation Osama would take on the attack
 sabase bada khatra is baat kaa tha ki kahin laden ghar ke bheetar se navy sil commando par hath golon se naa hamalaa kar de
 a four-legged lamb came with Navy SEAL commandos to protect them from such threats
 british akhbaar da san kaa daawa he ki america commando, osama ke thikaane par hamale ke liye apane saath ek german shefrd kutta bhi lekar aae the
 According to the newspaper, this dog was the first to enter Osama's hideout
 is german shefrd ne soongh kar ye jaanane kii koshish kii thi ki kahaan kahaan barood rakhe hai or kahaan log chupe hai
 Sending the dog, the Navy SEAL commandos wanted to be convinced that their enemy had not prepared to attack the commandos by laying ammo in the house
 akhbaar kaa daawa he ki kute se signal milane ke baad hi commando laden ke thikaane ke bheetar ghuse the
 Once the commandos understood that there was no landmine lying in their way, they entered the house fearlessly and then in the next 25 minutes, their biggest target was riddled with bullets
 akhbaar kaa ye bhi daawa he ki navy sil ke commando jis kute ko apane saath le gaye the wo unki combat trekar brigade kaa kutta ho
 The dogs of this brigade, prepared only a year ago, can reach any human by footprints or even a drop of blood
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki navy sil commando apane saath ye kutta is liye le gaye taaki osama agar bhaagane kii koshish kare to use pakadaa ja sake
 Even if Osama managed to escape from his hideout by listening to the sound of the helicopter or during the commando operation, he could not escape this fellow of the commando squad for much longer
 uske kadam ke nishaan soongh kar ye kutta osama peechha karata or uske jariye navy sil ke commando abtabad kii galiyon main bhi use dhund kar maar giraate
 The commandos did not want to let Osma get out of his hand this time, in any case, if the news was to be believed, that was the reason why he had taken his team's most loyal and loyal companions with him
 duniya kaa sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi osama bin laden kabhi apane paas phone nahin rakhata tha
 He hated mobile phones
 
 But he had two emergency numbers all the time
 osama kii maut ke baad in immergency numberon kaa raaj khulaa to america kii ankhen fatty kii fatty rah gai
 Will the world ever see the picture of Osama's death? Until now, the expectation was that the White House would release his pictures to convince the world that Osama was dead
 par america ne ye kah kar tasviren jari karne se manaa kar diya he ki tasviren behad vibhats hai or iske jari karne se america suraksha khatre main pad sakati he

 The cabinet committee on employment headed by the Prime Minister will have 10 members besides him, including Shah, Rajnath Singh, Sitharaman, Goyal, Agriculture and Panchayati Raj Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'nishank', Skill and Entrepreneurship Minister Mahendranath Pandey, Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri and Minister of State for Labor Santosh Kumar Gangwar
 sabase mushkil kaam sitaraman kaa he
 They have to prepare and present the budget in four weeks, whereas usually it takes three months or more

 i will do this work in two and a half to three years
 ''modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main sadakon ke nirmaan ne zyaadaatar paisa sarkaar ne hi lagaaya
 In order to move forward on this path, the Ministry will have to come out with a completely new type of investment model so as to attract investment

 The reluctance of lending banks and the accompanying NBFC crisis, both result in capital shut-downs for such ambitious projects and the government not having the fiscal scope to continue spending as before

 According to some economists, the first thing the government should do is to clarify its stand on the NBFC crisis

 One is to allow the nbfcs to fail, those who are not possible to keep alive, let them die, but go too fast and control its results

 However, there is a need to address the crisis of nbfcs from the perspective of growth

 Vikram Kirloskar, vice-chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motor and president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), says the NBFC crisis may be attributed in part to the slowness in motor vehicle sales

 Disinvestment and Welfare Schemes This is an area where the government needs to keep a close watch as disinvestment can provide enough money for the government to spend on welfare schemes without increasing the fiscal deficit

 a senior bureaucrat and an economist say that the government needs to move rapidly towards monetization of state-owned assets and an aggressive disinvestment agenda should be put in place to accelerate the economy through private investment
 ve kehete hai, ''aapako hawaii addon ke ek samaan fouran nijeekaran kii aavashyaktaa he
 There is no need for the government to run hotels, stadiums or firms like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited

 Eliminate the agrarian crisis: Agriculture is another area that Modi has entrusted to Narendra Singh Tomar, a MP from Madhya Pradesh who also holds the Ministry of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, which he was handling in the previous government
 krishi vikaas dar-2014 se 2019 tak ausatan 2
 7 percent — much less in the NDA regime than in the UPA years
 gramin mazdooree main kam vruddhi (disambar 2018 main 3
 8 per cent annually) and low prices of agricultural produce have created major problems in the rural economy and there is a lack of employment in this area and farmers' suicides still continue
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki sudhaaron ne krishi ko puri tarah se khatm kar diya he
 Economist Surjit Bhalla says, "we never paid any attention to agricultural reforms
" 1991 ke sudhaaron ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nahin kiya or upie ne to sudhaaron ko bepatori kar diya tha
 Why do we need the Essential Commodities Act? The APMC Act states that the farmer can sell his produce only in licensed mandis

 The agrarian crisis caused great damage to the BJP and the loss to the BJP in the assembly elections of the three Hindi states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in December presented a major challenge to the Modi government

 Professor Ashok Gulati, Infosys Chair of the Indian Council of Economic Research on International Economic Relations, says that increasing agricultural productivity in rural areas can be a step towards increasing demand in rural areas
 ise praapt karne ke liye, bharat ko apni krishi-jidipi vruddhi ko sanshodhit karne kii aavashyaktaa he jo 4 pratishat ke vaanchhneeya str se neeche he
 Gulati says, "there has never been any agricultural reform in India and farmers' income has been very low
 ''sudhaar prakriya puri karenpahale se shuru kiye gaye sudhaar thik-thik hone chahie or samaapt hone chahie
 "GST and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) need to be rectified," says Joshi

 iske pramukh labhaarthiyon main se ek to bijli kshetra kii companiyaan hai jo ibisi ke tahat diwaala karrwai ko sanderbhit kiye jane ke kagaar par thim
 Its estimated amount is said to be around 1 lakh crore rupees and banks had an eye on many properties from which they had expected to recover their dues
 ''shram or bhoomi sudharvisheshgy jiesti or ibisi jaise do pramukh sudhaaron kii disha main tatkaal karrwai karne kii baat karte hai jaisaa ki modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main hua tha
 There should be flexibility in labor reforms but trade unions have opposed the changes
 vartmaan main, shram ke vibhinn pahaluon jaise mazdooree, bonus, kaam karne kii sthiti or audyogic vivaadon ko niyantrit karne vaale 40 rajyastareey or kendriya kanoon maujuud hai
 Several recommendations have been made to strengthen these laws; In August 2017, a code on wages was introduced in the Lok Sabha
 yah code mazdooree, audyogic sambandhon, saamaajik suraksha or kalyaan, vyavsaayik suraksha or swasthya or kaamkaaji paristhitiyon par chaar kanoonon yaa shram code ko samekit karata he
 The Bill has been referred to the Standing Committee on Labor
 2019 main, ummid he ki sarkaar in sudhaaron ko tej karne kii koshish karegi
 a study by Exim Bank in 2013 found that provisions of Indian labor laws could be one of the reasons why enterprises in India remain small in size
 yahaan tak ki jab desh ko ek badi rojgaar chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, phir bhi yahaan kii fermon main kaam karne vaale shrambal kii ausat sankchaya 75 hi he, jo china ke 191 or indonesia ke 178 kii tulana main bahut kam he
 And this is when India's production base is largely labor intensive
 vishwa aarthik manch kii vaishvik pratispardhaa report main bhartiya shram bazaar main samvedansheeltaa ko bhi ujagar kiya gaya he
 Due to stricter labor laws, companies are compensating the workers with the use of capital ie automation
 joshi kehete hai, ''shram kanoon ko adhik lacheela banaaen taaki companiyaan shrambal kii purti ke liye swachaalan (automation) kii ore jane ko baadhya na hon
 "he points out that health is a labor intensive sector and that India will need more human peace in order to bring the health insurance scheme on the ground for everyone like Ayushman Bharat
" isi tarah, bhoomi adhigrahan ek kathin or bahut mahangi prakriya he
 a law passed by the UPA government set the compensation for urban areas at market value and for rural areas at twice the market value, causing land acquisition to be unsuitable for businesses
 vipaksh ke virodh ke baad sansad ke upree sadan yani rajyasabha main modi sarkaar kaa sanshodhit bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak paarit nahin ho sakaa
 Now states have been asked to implement their own land reforms in their respective states, which is confusing to investors
 shram or bhoomi sudhaaron ke liye visheshgy salaah dete hai ki centre sarkaar ko ek vyapak ruparekha taiyaar karke rajyon ke saath sahmati banane ke liye kaam karnaa hoga
 The country needs some short term reforms and long term structural reforms
 jaisaa bhaajapa ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh vinay sahasrabuddhe kehete hai, ''is sarkaar ke saamne jo badi chunautiyaan he unamem ek aisa dosharahit model bananaa jise har jagah doharaaya ja sake or rojgaar ke kshetra main aa rahi chunautiyon kaa saamana karne kii taiyaari kerani he
 Its basic preparation has been done and it is also clear that people can accept harsh decisions provided the decision maker has good intentions
 yah sarkaar ko majboot faisle lene ke liye prerit karata he
 Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive Officer of NITI Aayog, elaborating on the need for tough decisions, says, "we need to open large areas like coal, energy, oil and gas to private sectors
" ''sabanvis kehete hai, ''is baat ko sweekaar karnaa hoga ki aarthik vikaas main mandi he or yah isliye hua he kyonki khapat or nivesh, donon us str tak nahin bade hai, jitna hona chahie tha

 In addition, the government should reduce the corporate tax rate for all companies and link it to investment
 vyay ke liye unka maananaa he ki sarkaar ko rajkoshiya ghate ke lakshya ko paar karne se bachanaa chahie
 Apart from that, he has nothing to do much
 jiesti ko yuktisangat karne se kar sangrah main kami ai he
 It is also a state of equilibrium for trade, as GST has undoubtedly reduced the tax collection rate, but GDP growth may be accompanied by an increase in consumption, as Donald Trump claims in the US

 First of all, Facebook will bring a tool that will let users know whether their data has been misused
 -plateform rivyuu –fasebuk un sabhi eps kii jaanch karegaa jo 2014 se pehle logon se zyada data ikaithe karte the
 Because in 2014 the company reduced the data access done by the app
 iske liye fasebuk ne kaha ha ki kisi bhi ap jis par shaq hoga uskaa phul audit kiya jayega or unhen bain bhi kiya jayega
 - Telling people about the misuse of data - Facebook has said that the company will now tell those people about the apps that have misused their data
 ag fasebuk vaise eps ko hataata he jo yujar data kaa galat istemaal karte hai to aisi haalat main wo sabhi yugers ko isaki jaankaree degaa
 - Access to apps that you do not use will be terminated - Access will be terminated if no one has used an app on Facebook for the last three months so that information cannot be shared with them

 This includes the user name, profile photo and email address
 iske alaava duusare data ke liye un eps ko fasebuk ke apruval kii jarurat hogi
 - Telling people how to manage apps - We still show people how many apps are connected to their account and users can control the information shared with those apps
 ab ise ham pehle se aasaan or behatar banaaenge
 - Reward to those who find flaws in Facebook - The scope of the Facebook bug bounty program will be expanded
 ap developers dwaara ap ke jariye data ke galat istemaal ke bare main hamen koi bhi report kar saktaa he

 rajya sarkaar ne pichley saal josharabbandike khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya tha, uske sakaaratmak nattejey saamne aane lage hai, khaskar swasthya ke kshetra main
 "nitish also said that the new campaign launched by the Bihar government against dowry and child marriage from October 2 will have a positive impact
 nitish ne kaha, "farvari 2006 main ek surveykshan karaayaa gaya tha, jisamen paaya gaya tha ki ek praathmik swasthya centre par ek maheene main ausatan 39 marij ilaaj ke liye aate the
 After that we increased the availability of doctors at the health center, appointed paramedical staff and provided free medicines, so that the health centers could run properly
 iskaa parinaam yah he ki aaj praathmik swasthya centre par har maheene takreeban 10,500 se zyada marij pahunch rahe hai or apana ilaaj karvaa rahe hai
 " puri duniya nae saal kaa jashn manaa rahi he
 But North Korean dictator Marshall Kim Jong Un has threatened to throw the entire world into the fire of the Third World War on the very first day of the new year
 nae saal ke maukey par raashtra ke naam apane sandesh main kim jong un ne kaha ki newcliyar bam kaa batan har vakt uske teble par hota he
 The day he felt he would press the button
 nae saal par kim kii dhamkeeye pehali baar he jab kim jong un ne baqayada tivi par aakar khuleam parmanuhamale kii dhamkidi he
 Although this threat is directly for America, but it is clear that when nuclear war happens, the whole world will come in its stubbornness
 puri duniya bhale hi nae saal kaa jashn manaa rahi thi
 Saying goodbye to the year 2017 was welcoming the new year 2018
 lekin north korea kaa taanashaah duniya ko dhamka rahaa tha
 She also celebrated Kim Jong Un's Happy New Year to Trump
 jashn uske desh main bhi manaa
 But with this celebration of the new year, he made such a declaration that the world came into being
 log ek-duusare ko nae saal kii badhai de rahe the or wo nae saal main vishwa yuddh kii dhamkee de rahaa tha
 i was threatened by saying that the nuclear button stays on my desk
 jab chaahe dabaa duun
 Yes, North Korea's Tanashah Kim Jong-un usually threatens himself on TV
 magar nae saal ke maukey par raashtra ke naam sandesh dene wo khud tivi par aayaa or aate hi duniya ko dhamkee de daali
 Especially to America
 uski yahi dhamkee tisare vishwa yuddh kii vajah ban sakati he
 Kim Jong-un proclaimed that the whole of America is in North Korea's nuclear weapons, in his speech on North Korea's National Television on the occasion of US New Year's target
 wo ise dhamkee na samajhe ye hakeekat he
 The whole of America is within the ambit of our nuclear weapons and their nuclear button is always on my desk
 yah dhamkee nahin, sachai he
 We have developed the capability to attack atomic bombs on all parts of America
 agar dhamkaane kii koshish jari rahi to uttar korea parmaanu hamalaa karne se nahin chukegaa
 It should be kept in mind that missiles with nuclear weapons are deployed for attack
 mej par tabaahi kaa batanane saal par apane is bhaashan main taanashaah kim jong un ne america ko ye bataane kii koshish kii he ki korian peninsula main uski maujuudagi usee par baari par sakati he
 Because its nuclear weapons can devastate and devastate any American city at the press of a button
 kim jong un ne ishaaron ishaaron main ye bhi bataa diya ki tabaahi kaa ye batan uski teble par rahata he
 Which it will not take long to suppress
 north korea kii takat ko dekhte hue america kabhi hamale kii himakat nahin kar saktaa
 However North Korea is a responsible nuclear nation that wants peace
 hamaare parmaanu pareekshan jari rahenge
 But the aim is to make North Korea the most powerful nation in the world in terms of nuclear weapons
 haalmericaco blackmel nahin kar rahe hai
 Many countrymen are worried about nuclear tests, countries around the world have expressed concern about their frequent nuclear tests
 
 But Kim tried to assure all those countries that they were ready to reduce military tensions in the Korean peninsula if their country did not come down
 is dauraan taanashaah ne south korea ko bhi ye sandesh diya ki baatcheet ke raste khule hue hai
 Let me tell you that the Winter Olympics are going to be held in South Korea in February this year, in which Kim Jong Un also expressed the hope of North Korean players taking part
 nae saal par apane 28 minute ke bhaashan main kim jong un ne dakshin korea ke saath to baatcheet kii ichha zaahir kii he
 But in the threatening tone of America, he said that he should not make such a mistake that he has to take it

 landan olympic ke liye bhartiya team main khud ko shaamil kiye jane par hui deree par 25 varshiya sania mirza ne kaha, ''bhartiya tennis ke aapas main naaraaz chal rahe diggajon main se ek ko shant karne ke liye jis dhang se mujhe chaara banaaya gaya he, 21veen sadi kii bhartiya mahila ke taur par, vah mere liye mohabhang karne vaali baat he
 The manner of declaration and its time smells of male supremacism

 In recent times, Sania and Bhupathi had become a very strong pair of mixed doubles, having won the French Open title in May, which is Sania's second Grand Slam title so far
 eit kaa maananaa tha ki mixd dubles main liender ke saath sania ko khilaane se vah kadavi dawa thodi mithi ho jaaegi, jo eit ne liender ke liye taiyaar kar rakhi he-yani liender ko nichali rank vaale 24 varsh ke vishnu vardhan ke saath khilne ke liye majaboor kiya jaae

 There should never have been any question on him

 Bhupathi is apparently Sania's choice

 However, this task is now completely under the control of Sania's father Imran Mirza
 imran mirza apane yuva dinon main cricketer hua karte the, or unhone hi 1,017 shabdon kaa vah bayaan taiyaar kiya tha, jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki kis tarah se sania kaa chayan kiya janaa ek majaak he

 " Fiza in Himachal Pradesh is cold, but the political mercury here is going up as the election date draws near
 raajnneeti ke suurama ek-duusare ko pachhaadne ke liye apane tarkash se har tarah ke tir nikaal rahe hai
 The BJP was following the strategy of not declaring anyone as its chief ministerial candidate in this election, but the Congress has got trouble sitting on the issue by sitting on the attack
 darasal, jab tak himachal pradesh main bijepi ne purv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal ko party kaa mukhyamantri cheharaa ghoshit nahin kiya tha, tab tak yah ladaai mukhyamantri virbhadra singh banaam pradhanmantri narendra modi maani ja rahi thi
 The BJP was suffering a lot of political damage in this fight, as many big party leaders including Rahul Gandhi had succeeded to a large extent in bringing issues like demonetisation and GST closer to the business class, including the common people who were angry with them
 congress ne jaise hi virbhadra singh ko apana mukhyamantri cheharaa ghoshit kiya, taise hi party ke kai netaa bijepi kii ore se mukhyamantri cheharaa ghoshit na karne kii baat ko baar-baar oochhaalane lage
 There have also been speculations in the political corridors of Himachal that the bjp's central leadership, like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, will bet on a new face for the Chief Minister in the event of victory in Himachal
 aisi atakalon sepurv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhoomalka khemaa khud ko aahat mahasoos kar rahaa tha or chunaav prachaar ke liye ji-jaan se nahin jute paa rahaa tha
 The bjp's master strategist took feedback from party workers as soon as he reached Himachal Pradesh and found that Dhumal had acceptance in every district of the state
 ye bhi paaya gaya ki party se jin or netaaon ke naam mukhyamantri ke daavedaar ke taur par uchhal rahe the, unki pakad sirf apane-apane vidhansabha kshetron tak hi simit thi
 According to political experts, Amit Shah also stamped Dhumal's name for the Chief Minister's face because the party high command's favorite chief minister in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh could not show any special performance
 alabatta in donon rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke naam chaahe ve manohar laal khatter hon yaa phir yogi adityanath, kai vivaadon se jude najar aae
 There was also a discussion on the name of Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda from the BJP for the face of Himachal's Chief Minister, but the party high command thought it better to use his qualification at the Center instead of presenting Nadda as the Chief Minister's face, because the next Lok Sabha elections i too have only a year and a half left
 dhumal ko mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa ghoshit kiye jane ke baad beshak unke samarthakon main dugana josh mahasoos kiya ja rahaa he, lekin ye bhi sachai he ki chunaav prachaar ke liye ab ek haftaa bhi nahin bachaa he
 In such a situation, Dhumal will be able to address voters in how many assembly constituencies of Himachal Pradesh
 dhumal nae vidhansabha kshetra se is baar chunavi maidan main utarana bhi ek chunauti he
 This time the BJP has fielded Dhumal from Sujanpur instead of his traditional seat Hamirpur

 The comedy actor Veer Das looked at the matter from a different perspective
 unhone kaha, 'priy sakshi maharaj, jab tak hindu mahilaon kaa ek bhi baccha aapke bhaashanon par hansata rahegaa, tab tak ham thik-thaak rahenge
 Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha said, 'I want to make it clear that i am a different Hindu from Sakshi Maharaj's Hindus

 Even those in power could not escape their influence
 uttar pradesh or bihar se kai aise bahubali nikle hai jinke naam kaa sikaa kai rajyon main chalaa
 But in the meantime, there was a name which came to be known as the strength of the Bahubalis
 vah naam tha munna bajrangi kaa
 Notorious shooter and gangster Munna Bajrangi was shot dead last night in Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat jail
 upi kii rajdhani lakhanu se lekar dilli tak mafia don munna bajrangi kaa aatank tha
 In 2016, his brother-in-law Pushpjit Singh was murdered due to gang war
 munna police abhiraksha ke bich saale kii terahavin main bhaag lene ke liye lakhanu kii vikasnagar colony main pahunchaa tha
 At that time, Munna would not even know that after just two years, he too would be slaughtered in jail in the same manner
 bagpat jail main munna ke murder ne sansani failaa di he
 Who was Munna Bajrangimunna Bajrangi's real name was Prem Prakash Singh
 uskaa janm 1967 main uttar pradesh ke jonpur jile ke puredayal gaanv main hua tha
 His father Parasnath Singh had dreamed of making him a big man by reading and writing
 magar prem prakaash urf munna bajrangi ne unke armaanon ko kuchal diya
 He left school after the fifth grade
 kishor avasthaa tak aate aate use kai aise shauk lag gaye jo use jurm kii duniya main le jane ke liye kaaphi the
 The first step in the world of crime was that Munna was fond of keeping arms
 vah filmon kii tarah ek bada gangester bananaa chahta tha
 This was the reason that the police filed a case against him at the tender age of 17 years
 jonpur ke surehi thana main uske khilaaf marpet or avaidh asalha rakhane kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 After this, Munna never looked back
 vah jaraayam ke daldal main dhansata chalaa gaya
 The first murder in the 80s was that Munna was trying to establish his identity in the world of crime
 isi dauraan use jonpur ke sthaneey dabang mafia gajraj singh kaa sangrakshan hasil ho gaya
 Munna was now working for him
 isi dauraan 1984 main munna ne lut ke liye ek vyapaaree kii hatya kar di
 His mouth was bloodied
 iske baad usne gajraj ke ishaare par hi jonpur ke bhaajapa netaa ramchandra singh kii hatya karke purvanchal main apana dam dikhaaya
 He then killed many people

 It was operated from Gang Mow, but its impact was on the entire Purvanchal
 mukhtaar ansaari ne aparaadh kii duniya se raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa or 1996 main samaajawaadee party ke tikat par mau se vidhayak nirvaachit hue
 After this, the strength of this gang increased greatly
 munna sidhe par sarkari thekon ko prabhavit karne laga tha
 He was constantly working under the direction of Mukhtar Ansari
 thekedaari or dabangai ne badaye dushmanpurvanchal main sarkari thekon or vasuuli ke kaarobaar par mukhtaar ansaari kaa kabja tha
 But at the same time, fast rising BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai became a challenge for him
 un par mukhtaar ke dushman brijesh singh kaa haath tha
 Krishnananda Rai's gang was flourishing under his patronage
 isi vajah se donon gang apni takat badha rahe the
 Their relationship was also associated with the underworld
 krishnanand raay kaa badhata prabhaav mukhtaar ko raas nahin aa rahaa tha
 He entrusted Munna Bajrangi to eliminate Krishnanand Rai
 munna ne kii thi bijepi vidhayak kii hatyamukhtaar se farmaan mil jane ke baad munna bajrangi ne bhaajapa vidhayak krishnanand raay ko khatm karne kii sajeesh rachi
 And because of that, on 29 November 2005, at the behest of mafia don Mukhtar Ansari, Munna Bajrangi put Krishnanand Rai to sleep in broad daylight
 usne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar lakhanu hive par krishnanand raay kii do gadiyon par AK47 se 400 goliyaan barasaai thi
 Apart from MLA Krishnanand Rai, 6 other people running along with him were also killed in this attack 
 postmortem ke dauraan har mritak ke sharir se 60 se 100 tak goliyaan baraamad huin thi
 This massacre created a stir in the political circles of the province
 har koi munna bajrangi ke naam se khauf khaane laga
 He became the most wanted after committing the murder
 munna ke sir par tha lakhon kaa inaambhajapa vidhayak kii hatya ke alaava kai maamalon main uttar pradesh police, estf or sibiai ko munna bajrangi kii talash thi
 Therefore a reward of seven lakh rupees was also declared on him

 He kept changing his location continuously
 police kaa dabaav bhi badhata ja rahaa tha
 Panahup Police and STF were constantly searching for Munna Bajrangi in Mumbai
 uskaa upi or bihar main rah paanaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 Delhi too was not safe for him
 isliye munna bhagkar mumbai chalaa gaya
 He spent a long time there
 is dauraan uskaa kai baar videsh janaa bhi hota rahaa
 Relations with his underworld people were also becoming stronger
 vah mumbai se hi phone par apane logon ko disha nirdesh de rahaa tha
 In politics, Munna once tried to field a dummy candidate for the Ghazipur Lok Sabha seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 munna bajrangi ek mahila ko gajipur se bhaajapa kaa tikat dilwane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Due to which his relations with Mukhtar Ansari were also deteriorating
 yahi vajah thi ki mukhtaar uske logon kii madad bhi nahin kar rahe the
 After being disappointed with the BJP, Munna Bajrangi joined the Congress
 vah congress ke ek kaddavar netaa kii sharan main chalaa gaya
 The Congress leaders were also residents of Jaunpur district
 magar mumbai main rah kar siyasat karte the
 Munna Bajrangi also supported Netaji in the Maharashtra assembly elections

 He had become a problem for the police
 uske khilaaf sabase zyada maamle uttar pradesh main darj hai
 But on 29 October 2009, Munna was dramatically arrested by Delhi Police in Malad area of mumbai
 mana jaataa he ki munna ko apane encounter kaa dar sata rahaa tha
 So he got himself arrested by Delhi Police under a scheme
 munna kii giraftaar ke is oparation main mumbai police ko bhi ain vakt par shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The Delhi Police later said that Munna Bajrangi is suspected to have been involved in the murder of Delhi's controversial encounter specialist Rajbir Singh
 isliye use giraftaar kiya gaya
 Since then, he is being kept in different jails
 is dauraan uske jail se logon ko dhamkaane, vasuuli karne jaise maamle bhi saamne aate rahe hai

 com Gurcharan Das: The latest interpretation of the ancient text Mahabharata Azmahakaavya The Hindi translation of the book The Difficulty of Being Good, based on the Mahabharata, has been interpreted in the context of the present dilemmas, events and characters in the difficulty of goodness
 pustak ke mul lekhak proctor and gambal ke purv siio or korporate jagat ke jane-maane hastakshar gurcharan das hai, jinhone is pustak ke jariye mahabharat kaal kii paristhitiyon kii samakaleen vivechna karne kaa sarthak prayaas kiya he
 In this, he also made the basis of his corporate experiences
 anuvadak manohar notani or unke sahyogi anil singh ne moulik pustak kii bhaavana ko kaaphi had tak prastut to kiya he lekin kai jagahon par yah tay karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki lekhak ne kahana kya chaha tha
 If this weakness is ignored, then there are many readable things in the book
 lekin anudit hone ke kaaran kahin-kahin pustak atyadhik clisht ho gai he
 Because of this, reading this book together will be difficult to understand
 lekin tamaam adhyyon ko alag-alag karke padhaa jaae to ise mahabharat ke kuch anshon par lambii or saapeksh vivechna kaha ja saktaa he jo pathakon ko aaj kii duniya kii avasarwaadi naitikta se rou-ba-rou karti he
 The book also discusses Hindutva and debates on the meaning of religion which is very pithy
 pustak kaa buniyadi sandesh yah he ki mahabharat kaa yuddh nirarthak or sarvanashi tha or vyaktigat dwesh ke liye ladaa gaya tha or uske kirdaar aaj ke samaaj ke logon kii hi tarah swaarthee, irshyaalu, ku til or nijee laabh ke vasheebhoot the
 In fact, the author wants to prove that war is a compulsion in which victory does not come from any party, but despite knowing / hearing this Adisatya, wars have been taking place
 is lihaaj se pustak soch ko paryaapt saamagree detii he
 The author tries to argue through the title of the book that there are difficulties in the path of goodness, but in spite of this goodness is the best
 achchhai kya he, yah tay karnaa bhi kaaphi mushkil he
 The conflict between religion and karma is also analyzed here
 lekhak ke hi shabdon main ''mahakavy kaa kendriya prasang naitik shuddhta or maanav karm ke bich pasri duvidha ko naatakeey dhang se prastut karata he
 "through this book, in the light of the Mahabharata, the author advocates harmonizing ethics, policy and pragmatism, which is the right path for today's times
" pustak main vaishvik paridrishy par bhi mahabharat ke sandarbh main tathyaparak tippanee kii gai he
 For example, the recession and the defeat of the Lehman Brothers
 vartmaan main mahabharat kii ghatnaon ke aadhaar par bahut kuch siikhaa, samajha, sudhara bhi ja saktaa he
 Particularly readable parts of the book are its two last chapters 'conclusion' and 'dharma-katha a word key', which is the essence of the book
 dharm kii shastreey vivechna karte hue is lekhak ne kai gudh lekin buniyadi vishyon par sodaaharan tippanee kii he, jo ki is pustak kii khaasiyat he
 In the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi on Monday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government Parjamkar, while after the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting on Tuesday, party leader and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu took a dig at Rahul Gandhi's allegations
 kendriya mantri ne kaha congress aise bayaan de rahi he, jaise shaitan pravachan de rahaa ho
 Describing the land bill as being in the interest of farmers, Venkaiah said, "the interest of farmers has been taken care of in the bill
 kuch kamiyaan thim, jinhen dur kar sanshodhit bill somvaar ko sadan main pesh kiya gaya
 Attacking the Congress, the Union Minister said that opposition to the Congress is beyond comprehension
 unhen sochna chahie kiupie sarkaarake dauraan ve khud kitne adhyadesh lekar aaen
 Venkaiah Naidu said, 'it is as if a cat ate a hundred rats and went to Haj
 ''homework kare congress'venkaiya naidu ne aage kaha, '10 baar bolne se jhooth sach nahin ho jaataa
 The Congress itself has been bringing many ordinances
 nehru ke samay main 76, indira gandhi ke samay main 77, rajeev gandhi ke samay 35, narsimha raav ke kaarykaal main 77 or vamadal ke saath banicongress sarkaarabhi 77 adhyadesh lekar ai thi
 Congress is talking like the devil is preaching

 Yes, if BJP leaders get hit in Delhi, then the leaders of Aam Aadmi Party may come but Congress should not

 aakhir rajaneta kii anupasthiti kii khaali jagah ko kisi rajaneta se hi to bharna he
 Because the pressure also remains that if the BJP leaders are not able to come then at least the Congress leaders should not sit on the chair of the chief guest of the ceremony
 chaahe kisi or party kaa aa jaaen
 Many politicians and celebrities go to the head of the Nyotalavkush Ramlila Committee, Ashok Agarwal says that politicians keep coming but we are not under the influence or pressure of anyone
 vaise ham sabhi raajnneetik dalon, unke netaaon, mantriyon, mukhyamantriyon, deshon ke rajdooton or anya hastiyon ko nimantran bhejte hai
 It depends on the guests when and how they can come
 ham to congress adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh ko sidhe jaakar bhi aamantrit kar aae hai
 Now even through Aaj Tak, we request that he should definitely visit the Dussehra celebrations
 ramlila cametiyon kaa hota he raajnneetik jhukaavye to kehane kii baat he lekin andar kii baat ye he kiramlila aayojanakarne vaali cametiyon kaa apana raajnneetik jhukaav hota he
 At the same time, the pressure and influence of political parties also cannot be denied
 ramlila ke manch kaa craij har raajnneetik party or netaa ko hota he
 Every political party wants to reach there and say its point
 iske liye cametiyon par dabaav bhi hota he
 Deepak Singhal, head of the Shri Raghunandan Leela Committee, Delhi Cantt, supports this, saying that there is political pressure
 har party or uskaa netaa chaahe parshad ho yaa saansad, har koi chahta he ki sirf unke samarthak hi manch par chadhen
 Give the same speech
 virdohi najadik bhi naa fatken
 This is a big challenge for the Ramlila Organizing Committees, how to create harmony among everyone
 saansad or abhinayta manoj tiwari kaa kahana he ki mujhe bhi anubhav hua he raajnneeti kaa
 Political pressure on Ramlila committees is not appropriate
 ye to sabaki lila he hamaari samskruti kii lila
 The controversy over the calling of PM Modi, Ramlila's political killings did not even save the Ramlila Committee of Ramlila Maidan, one of the old Ramlila grounds in Delhi
 yahaan aazaadee ke baad se ab tak dashahra utsav main congress ke hi netaa aate rahe hai
 Whether the party has been in power or is out of power
 do saal pehle jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ko dashahra utsav ke mukhya atithi banane kaa nyotaa dene kii baat uthi to cameti ke sangrakshak jai prakaash agarwal ad gaye ki agar aisa hua to wo cameti chhod denge
 It was in this tussle that the committee sent an invitation and JP Aggarwal left the committee in protest
 unhone navashree ramlila cameti kaa daaman tham liya or is puure yukand kaa clymex ye rahaa ki piem modi aae bhi nahin
 Despite this, JP admits that there is no political fencing or camp in the Ramleelas
 haa, rajanetaaon main ramlila ke manch kaa craij jarur he
 JP Aggarwal, the chief patron of PM Modinashwari Religious Leela Committee, will go to Ramlila in Lucknow, says that religious and cultural things only happen on the platform of Ramlila
 sabhi netaa vahaan apni soch share karne janaa chaahate hai
 Another big Ramlila Sri Dharmik Ramlila committee of Old Delhi, in which the President has been coming every year since independence
 lekin upie sarkaar ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh donon kaarykaal main har saal yahaan aae
 This time also President Pranab Mukherjee is coming here but the news is yet to come from the PM
 piem dashahara par chunavi rajya upi kii rajdhani lakhanu ke eshbagh kii ramlila main dashahra utsav main shaamil honge
 Then in 2014, PM Modi came here for the first time
 iske baad 2015 main wo america main the to is baar lakhanu
 The coming and coming of PM does not have any effect on Dussehra's boom in Delhi because its political implications are also extracted
 swadeshi company iball ne 6,799 rupee main 4G smartphone Andi 5Q Gold launch kiya he

 The Narendra Modi government made changes in the land acquisition bill of the UPA government, saying that it is necessary to carry forward the hanging projects, although the reality is quite different
 sarkaar se in lataki pariyojnaon kii list hasil karne kii enditivi kii baar-baar kii gai koshishon ke baavjood yah hamen nahin mil sakaa
 However, a top industrial unit has given a list of stuck projects worth about one thousand crore rupees to NDTV
 isse pataa chalata he ki 67 mega projectus main se sirf saat yani ki sirf 10% pariyojnaayen hi aisi he, jinaki raah main jameen adhigrahan roda bani
 The remaining 90 per cent are due to stranded projects
 vahiin jo saat pariyojnaayen jameen adhigrahan kii vajah se atakin, unamem se chah sadak pariyojna hai
 In fact, at the time of September 2013, only 12 projects were stuck on the land issue
 inamen se chaar (do sadak evam do urja pariyojna) pariyojnaon main beete saal thodi pragati dekhi gai
 All these facts raise questions on the government's claim to stop land acquisition last year
 is babat hamane bijepi pravaktaa jiviel narsimha raav se baat kii to unhone kaha, 'main aisi kisi bhi list ke bare main nahin jaanata
 ' sarkaar ne atake pade nivesh kaa koi aankada to saajha nahin kiya he, lekin is list se pataa chalata he ki is pariyojanon main deree kii vajah bhoomi adhigrahan kii samasya nahin, balki vibhinn sarkari mahakamon se manjuuri milane main hui deree kii asal vajah rahi

 The third season of the most watched TV show 'main Kuch Kuch Kiya Kari' in India is going to start
 yah doordarshan par telecast hota he or minal vaishnav isamen lead actress hai
 The purpose of this show is to show the mirror of truth to the atrocities on women and the evils in society
 minal sho main dow sneha maathur kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai
 We had a special conversation with Meenal Vaishnav of 'main Kuchh Karti Karti' and Poonam Mutreja, Executive Director of Population Foundation of India
 is dauraan donon ne apane jivan ke har pahalu par khulkar baat kii
 Apart from social evils and Meetu Capain, he also expressed his opinion on upcoming projects
 Ans- mujhe kuch audishans dene ke baad 'main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' main dow
 Found the role of Sneha Mathur
 us vaqt mujhe laga tha ki yah bhi baaki television serials jaisaa hi ek hoga
 But when we went to shoot in different villages of the country after working in 'main Kuchh Karti Karti' and met the people there, then by seeing their condition and hearing their stories, we came to know about this show on their life Is having an effect
 tab pehali baar aisa laga jaise zindagi main kuch acha kiya he or kisi kii zindagi meri vajah se thodi se behatar ho paa rahi he
 Unknowingly, life has made me a part of one big mission
 Ans- har insaan ke jivan main aisi kai paristhitiyaan aati he jise sochakar vah bura mahasoos karata he
 There also came a time in my life when i was 18 years old and my family wanted to marry me, but i wanted to work by writing further
 apane sapane ko puraa karne ke liye bahut sari ladaaiyaan ladane ke baad, aakhir gharavaalon ko meri zid ke saamne ghutane techne pade
 i believe that it is wrong to hurt your family, but when you are right then you should not think of anyone
 jab ham sahi kaam karte he, tab sab ko yah ehsaas ho jaataa he kii kya sahi he or kya galat
 Ans- In order to fight the evils of this society, women must first understand that they themselves should not become enemies of other women
 hame yah sochna chahie kii jis dard se ham gujarey he, us dard sekhoi or na gujarey
 We women should have confidence in our ability - i should believe that 'I can do anything' - i can improve my life, improve the condition of my village - i can change the country
 jis din ham yah samaj jaayenge kii hamaari apni khubiyaan he jo hame baaki sabase alag banaati hai, ham dusron se or apane aap se pyaar karne lagenge jo kii bahut zyada zaruri he
 With this we will never let ourselves go wrong not only with ourselves but also with others
 is tarah se duniya main galat hona hi band ho jaayegaa
 Ans- # metoo has the advantage that not only in the film industry but also in small cities, now people will think maybe ten times before messaging a colleague
 mujhe lagata he kii yah ek bahut hi acchhee baat he jisase kii mahilaon ko, bacchon ko or purushon ko ek bahut hi surakshit or sayanmit vaataavaran main jeene or kaam karne kaa mauka milegaa
 Ans- We are shooting the third season of 'main Kuch Kuch Karti' and very soon this serial will be on TV
 mujhe is tarah kaa koi doosraa sho yaa to mila nahin yaa main dhund nahin paayi jisase kisiiki zindagi par sakaaratmak prabhaav pade
 i just don't want cheap entertainment
 main manoranjan ke saath hi zindagiyaan behatar karne ke liye prerana bhi dena chaahati hoon
 The day i get a chance to work in a similar film or serial, i will definitely do it
 Ans- main # metoo kaa samarthan karti hoon
 i feel that it is the right of every human to live and work in a safe environment
 isliye main # metoo kaa samarthan karti hum
 No such incident ever happened to me
 Ans- is upkram main kai ghatakon kaa athulaneey yogadan rahaa he
 But i would like to highlight the 3 most important components - Firstly i would like to give full credit to Creative Director Feroz Abbaz Khan and the entire production team
 unke vdara nirmit yah kaarykram manoranjan ke saath alag alag vishyon par sandesh dene vaali ek shandaar shrinkhalaa he jisamen paariwari yojana, ling chunaav jaise vishyon kaa samavesh he jis par aamtaur par khul kar charchaa nahin kii jaati or vyavhaar main parivartan laane ke liye isame manoranjan ke saath saath shiksha kaa bhi samavesh kiya gaya he
 - The second reason for the success of this program - This series has ample evidence from the world on entertainment and education, which has succeeded in changing social norms and health-related behavior
 or ham bahut hi bhaagyashaalee he kii hamen manoranjan va shiksha par prasiddh vaishvik visheshgy professor arvind singhl ji kaa maargdarshan mila he
 - i would like to give full credit to Feroz ji and his team because they have gone from place to place and researched various problems and their solutions for this program
 isi research kii vajah se is kaarykram ke kirdaar or kahaniyaan is had tak sach lagate he
 Ans- 'I can do anything' does research on real life and social mobility, focusing on entertainment
 bhale hi katha kaalpanik ho, series main ham jo samaadhaan dikhaate hai, ve vaastavik hote he
 These are based on the stories of people who have made changes in their lives or offered unique solutions in the face of patriarchy, discrimination and prejudices
 yah series ko asli jivan or vaastaviktaa kaa ehsaas detaa he
 In season 3, we want to reach India's youth population
 isliye, hamaare paas television naatak ke saath digital media par bada focus he
 Dr
 Sneha will appear in a digital avatar on an artificial intelligence-driven chatbot, the first of its kind globally
 ve sawaalon ke jawaab dengi or darshakon ke saath jaankaree saajha karengi
 We are now expanding the message to the digital space as well
 kahani pehle se kahin adhik manoranjak he or dow sneha kii yatra desh ke chehre ko badalane (yaa is naare kii tarah ki- desh kaa cheharaa badal duungi) ke liye jari he
 Ans- The program aims to address and address social norms, attitudes and practices on issues affecting women rights, sexual and reproductive health
 main change ke asli nayakon kii kahaniyon par vichaar karata hum, jo hamaare kaarykram kii safalataa ke vaastavik hero he
 a girl from Nayagaon village in Madhya Pradesh's Chhatarpur district could convince her parents to send her to college and not marry after school, a young woman from Bihar refusing to have a child in her community too early Has become, instead of killing a male wife from a village in Madhya Pradesh, became the champion of male participation in family planning
 aisi kai or kahaniyaan hamaari dharna ko majboot karti hai ki kaarykram un logon ke saath gaharaa sambandh banaata he, jo anderservd he or jinhen change agent banane ke liye shaktishaalee kahaniyon kii aavashyaktaa he
