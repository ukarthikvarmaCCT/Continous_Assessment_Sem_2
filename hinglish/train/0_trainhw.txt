 He said that this is a Hindu country, if a threat comes to Hindu society, the country will also be in danger
 bhagwat ne kaha ki aaj maanav samaaj ke baad samaksh jo samasyaayein hai, ve isliye hai, kyonki dharm ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya
 Referring to the ideology of the Sangh, Bhagwat said that if anyone really wants to know about the Sangh, then they should look closely at the Sangh, they should know what is the working of the Sangh and how does it work
 dharmantaran kaa zikr karte hue bhagwat ne kaha ki dharm parivartan se agar sabase zyada kisi ko nuksaan hua he to vah he hindu dharm

 This song from Hunter film is Hunter Three Not Three (303)
 303 se ve log waakif honge jo aksar akhabaaron main sex life main nai jaan foonkane ke vigyapanon se rou-ba-rou hote rahe hai
 This song from producer Anurag Kashyap's film Hunter is the hallmark of songs that are double meaning and bold in Bollywood
 kabhi jam chhalkaane tak simit rahane vaala bollywood ab ganje tak pahunch chukaa he or tauba yah matvaali chaal ab bam dole tak kaa safar tay kar chuki he
 Salman's fan to hero to show Tashan
 
 
 jo leve panga kar duun maa bahan tak bolne main parhez nahin he
 It is a film song of the new era, in which songs related to alcohol, sex and boldness are being written, and they are also becoming hits
 lekin kuch log ise foohadataa maan rahe hai
 Singer Richa Sharma says, "I don't agree with the kind of words used in them
" yah bahaanaa sahi nahin he ki log isi tarah ke gane pasand karte hai kyonki unhen kya dikhaanaa or sunaanaa he, yah to hamaare haath main he
 "how badla songs are very easy to use in Mijadesh and the younger generation in English as well as the words of different regional languages with ease
 technology ne jindagi ko badalakar rakh diya he
 Life became cool and o My God changed to OMG
 saal bhar main banane vaali film ab do se teen maheene main taiyaar ho rahi hai or isi fatafat andaaj main geet-sangeet taiyaar hone laga he
 Icons and analogies are changing
 aise main raper hani singh kaa daawa beja nahin lagata ki unke gaanon par beshak kitne bhi aarope lagate rahen ki unke bol achche nahin hote, lekin unke saare gane aam jindagi se prerit hote hai
 What is seen is sold, or the request of 'what is being spoken should be written' is more than before
 lihaaja, sahitya or cinema main is samskruti kii jhalak dikhnaa lajimi he
 By the way, even in the 1980s, one or two examples are found when some of the songs related to the controversy got very loud
 vidhaataa (1982) film kaa gaanaa saat saheliyaan aisa hi tha
 Its beginnings in the nineties can be traced to the choli of Khalnayak (1993), which was led by the pair of Govinda and David Dhawan
 khuddar (1994) kaa sexi sexi sexi mujhe log bolen, raja babu (1994) kaa sarkaai lev khatiya or andaaj (1994) kaa khadaa he khadaa he jaise gaanon kii bharmaar rahi
 The trend has progressed to such an extent that it has reached the whistle of the engine via DK Bose (delhi Belly) and Bittoo Sab Ki Lega (bittu Boss) to Bum Dole (sundar 2014)
 haalanki geetkaar is tarah ke gane banane kii ek vajah filmon main bhaavnaatmakataa ke khatm hone ko bhi maanate hai
 Lyricist Javed Akhtar says, "even if one wants to write today, there is no place for good and emotional songs
 ''babydal (raagini ms-2) or chittiyaan kalaaiyaan (roy) jaise hit or saaf-suthere sang de chuki sangeetkaar jodi meet bros is saal lagbhag 40 gane lekar aa rahe hai
 They say that there are four to five songs whose lyrics can be objected by some people
 ve kehete hai, ''jis tarah kii janata demand karti he, or jo hit hota he vaisaa hi banataa he
 Anyway, the lyricist is like a producer's producer, the music is prepared as he wants
 ''bazaar or audiensofilm industry kaa ek hissaa yah maanata he ki bazaar ke dabaav or audiens kii maang kii vajah se is tarah ke geet taiyaar hote hai
 Audience not only makes it a hit but also enjoyes it fiercely
 hani singh ke gaanon kii aalochana ke baavjood lokapriyata ke maamle main unka sani nahin
 Lyrics are not as important as their aggressive marketing
 isaki badaulat chocolate ke naam par gud bhi bechaa ja saktaa he
 This is a tremendous marketing for the songs, due to which they get on the tongue
 iske liye produsar gaanon ke aakarshak bol kii maang karte hai
 For example, aggressive marketing and boldness have always been weapons for producer Ekta Kapoor
 phir vah chaahe da darty pikchar kaa chutki jo tuune kaati he ho yaa phir shootout ait wadala kaa laila teri le legi
 The funny thing is that even those who write and sing these songs are talking about the lyrics being absurd
 hunter 303 ke gayak bappi lahidi kehete hai, ''aajkal ke gane betuke ho gaye hai
 "akhtar talks about the decline in such trends only when he refuses to write such songs
" richa kahati hai, ''jab ham acha denge to ve acha hi sunenge
 What is the heart thing, you know my life or take beedi jala and drank from the liver
 
 
 gaanon main khub masti he
 Shringar is also a put of juice
 lekin valgerity nahin
 There should be dignity in everything
 ''produsar jaanate hai ki naitikta yaa maryaada kii nigahabaani ke liye sensor board he
 They are worried about profits on their investments
 or unheen kii tarah geetkaar-sangeetkaar ko bhi apni daal-roti ke bare main sochna hota he
 "kitchen must go on," says the Meet Brothers
 ham nahin likhenge to produsar kisi or se karvaa legaa
 The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), headed by the censor board's staunch Tvarab Pahlaj Nihalani, may pose a threat to such songs
 isaki bhanak is baat se mil sakati he ki board ne haal hi main aise 34 shabdon kii suchi jari kii thi, jinhen filmon main istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 But after much deliberation, this decision was withdrawn
 haalanki sensor board ke ek sadsy is baat par jor dete hai ki hamaara kaam film se jude suzav dena he, use pratibandhit karnaa nahin
 The scale of morality varies with time
 aise main filmawaalon ko isaki simaaen khud tay kerani hongi kyonki use maryaadaaon ke saath hi kool hote daur ke saath kadamtal bhi to kerani he
 At the initiative of PM Modi, an atmosphere has been created against VIP culture in the country

 siem yogi ne puure rajya main 21 april se hi laal or neeli batti ke istemaal par brake lagane kaa aadesh jari kar diya
 It said that no leader, minister or officer would put red and blue lights on their trains

 No vipgiri will run in jail
 CM Yogi has also hurt the vipigiri running in jail
 yogi adityanath ne adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya he ki rajya bhar kii jelon main band sabhi mafia don or saamaanya aparaadhiyon ko ek jaisaa khaanaa or anya suvidhaayen di jaae
 CM said that in previous governments, it has often been heard that mafia don is living a happy life even after being kept in jail and is using the phone recklessly
 ab aisa nahin chalegaa
 The authorities have been given clear instructions in this regard

 daftaron main anushaasan hona chahie
 For this, Yogi conducted surprise inspection of many offices and officials were clearly told to listen to the complaints of the people and take immediate action on them

 Police officers were instructed to walk for one hour every day to know the public's problems and take action on them
 siem yogi ne kaha ki police ke janata ke bich rahane se logon kaa kanoon-vyavastha main bharosa banegaa

 This world is definitely something secret
 aaie jaanate hai kyon veere ko notice karnaa chahie

 mail EGO ko ladakiyon kaa jabardast thengavire di wedding main bhi baaki bollywood filmon kii tarah romance, milanaa-bichhadnaa or phir rone-dhone kaa masala he
 But it does not have side effects
 kyonki isamen najar ai ladakiyon ke liye brallep ke dard kii dawa kisi band kamare main aansu bahaanaa yaa 'no mechap luk' main najar aana nahin he
 Rather, you have to leave things behind while enjoying the holiday in a more glam look
 ladakiyon kaa ye kool atitude 'mail igo' ko jhatka detaa he
 Why object to this? Do the boys own the copyright to have a liquor party with friends after a breakup from their girlfriends? 50 karod ke kareeb veere di wedding, raji ne bajet se 4 guna zyada kamaaye # 2
 Not used to looking at cultural shock or new trends, female characters have never been shown to be sexually active as much as the talk of 'sexual desire' has been openly talked about in Bollywood so far
 ab tak filmon main ladakon ko hi edlt kamedi karte dekha gaya he
 Unlike the mainstream Hindi cinema in Veere Di Wedding, such a look of women is probably being seen for the first time
 jabaki aisa nahin he ki real life main ye kirdaar yaa log dekhne ko nahin milte
 By watching this film, most of the girls will remember all the stories of their friend groups, which are similar to all the characters of 'veere Di Wedding'
 film main gaaliyon kaa istemaal yakeenan ajeeb he
 It also gives a kind of cultural shock
 lekin kya sach main aisa ho nahin rahaa? gaaliyaan agar hero ke munh se nikle to theatre main taaliyaan sunne ko milti hai lekin cinema main jab aisi gaaliyaan kisi heroin kii jubaan se nikalati he to logon ko saanp soonghney lagata he
 Why brother? The world has changed a lot in the last 18 years
 ab ladakiyon ko tay khaanche main mat dekhie

 'but, no-' In our marriages, the relationship of two hearts is less, but the hearts of relatives are more connected
 ' veere di wedding ne phir isaki yaad dilaa di
 Learning every habit of in-law of the girl well is the biggest demand of traditional weddings
 par kalindi (karina kapur kaa kirdaar) jaisi ladakiyon kaa kya kiya jaae? jinka maananaa he - "jo jaisaa ho uske saath vaise hi pesh aana chahie
 "even girls with such thinking are not easily married
 veere di wedding kii kalindi kii shaadi ruk gai
 It was good that he understood life partner or else Kalindi's marriage was difficult
 vaise he yah filmi kahani hi he
 Where in real life does a boy give such a feeling to a Kalindi? # 4
 or ladakiyon ko kyon pasand aegi ye filmavire di wedding box offis par jamkar kama kar rahi he
 Despite all the shortcomings, Veere Di Wedding is something that the new generation especially girls / women are liking
 zyaadaatar 30-35 saal kii umr tak kii ladakiyon ko
 Actually, she feels connected to all the characters of this film
 ek purush pradhan soch kii prakriya main aap bhale hi film kii aalochana kar nikal len, lekin zyaadaatar ladkiyaan 'veere di wedding' kii asaliyat se ittefaq rakhti hai
 There should be space for all the debate on the bold scene of Swara, but also do not forget that there is another emotion in women besides 'emotions like Love, Anger, Mamta, Daya' - Sexual Desire

 lekin in dinon kuch aisi hi haalat hazaron begunaahon ke koon se apane haath rangane vaale pakistani aatankwaadi haafiz said kii he
 Till yesterday, Hafiz Saeed used to teach Hindustan a lesson, now he is trying to justify the way of killing and watching the Indian Army's fight
 asal main akele isi saal hindustani fuj nekashmiramen dhai sau se zyaada aatankwaadiyon ko maut kii neend sula diya he, aise main haafiz said ne jo nayaa video jari kiya he, usamen wo memiata sunai de rahaa he
 The terrorists are saying "I am presenting the Tehsim today to them on this Azim sacrifice of my Azim Kashmiri brothers
 indian army chif se ye kahana chahta hum ki kabase goliyaan maar rahe hai
 Shot straight
 
 Is this the way to kill men and women? ye darjan se zyada katl or bisiyon jakhmi jaan tod rahe hai
 Killing these pills does not solve the issues in the world
 vajeer-e-ajam se guzarish karata hum is masale ko chhod naa diya jaae
 "what happened to Hafiz? maaloom hota he aatankistan main sab kheriyat nahin he
 Otherwise, Hafiz Saeed, famous for his giddy gestures, does not appear in the statements of helplessness
 ghati main oparation ol out kaa asar hafiz said or uske gurgon par thik vaise hi ho rahaa he
 Like mosquitoes after installing mosquito repellent in the house
 bharat kaa dushman hafiz said kah rahaa he "main poochta hum army chif ke saath jo aakhri oparation karne ja rahaa he
 Shot straight
 mardon auraton ko is tarah katl karnaa kya yahi rastaa he taharikon ko khatm karne kaa
 To solve this problem
 asia ke sabase bade champion banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 i want to ask that Indian Government and the Army Chief
 jo ijapha kiya he to aap iskaa kya nateeja le leng
 There is only one path
 kashmir ko aazaadee do
 "actually, they were taking our soldiers lightly
 magar sena ne thodi aankh kya dikhaai
 He came on his knees only
 or insaaniyat kaa paath padhaane lage
 But sir, the first condition for taking or giving lessons of humanity
 insaan hona he
 And in this scale, this most dreaded suicide in the world does not fit
 khayr ise hafiz said kii wo baukhalaahat samajhie jise alphaz nahin mil paa rahe hai
 Due to the Operation Allout of the Indian Army, the condition of the terrorists who exported from Pakistan to Kashmir has been in the form of Tu Chal Main Main Aaya
 ab alam ye he ki kashmir ke tamaam aatanki sanghathanon main staff kii kami ho gai he
 And to meet this deficiency, the youth of Kashmir are being kidnapped so that they can be tricked into making them terrorists
 jo apni hi ghati ke logon kaa katleam karen
 But Operation All Out has taken away all the plans of Hafiz
 or ulta ghati ko begunaahon ke khun se laal karne vaala ab shanti kaa paath padhaa rahe hai
 The army's operation has not only washed away all the wishes of Hafiz, but has also made him realize that this full action of the Indian soldiers will continue till the terrorists of the valley are taken to heaven
 saal abhi khatm bhi nahin hua or sena ab tak 251 aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar chuki he
 The count will still continue
 or tab tak ye countdown chalata rahegaa, jab tak ghati ko aatankiyon se clin nahin kar diya jaataa
 The army has also vowed that unless Pakistan stops feeding the stones of treason to the treason
 tab tak ye oparation rukne vaala nahin he
 So till then get used to these videos of Hafiz mourning
 apnevideo macejamen hafiz said kah rahaa he "main aaj apane azim kashmiri bhaaiyon kii is kadra azim qurbaani par aaj unako tahseem pesh karata hum or main yakeen se kahata hum ki inshollah kashmir kii aazaadee ke din kareeb hai
 Allah ta'ala sacrifices the sacrifice
 jald sehatyab kare lekin main guzarish karnaa chahta hum ki aapane bade raste kaa intakhaab kar liya he
 The surface that has been sacrificed
 aazaadee kii kuch nahin he
 Insha Allah very soon, the people of Kashmir will have a magnificent independence, the biggest incident of this century
 "hafiz said kaa gam samajha ja saktaa he
 Because for the last two years
 
 Ever since Operation All Out has started
 tab se sarhad paar se bharat main aatanki aate to zarur hai, magar waapas nahin ja pate hai
 Till now hundreds of Hafiz's henchmen have sacrificed without doing anything
 or aatank ke ek bhi mansoobey ko bhartiya sena ne puraa nahin hone diya he

 ) The stars of Chinese tech company Huawei are currently seen in the dark
 khaas kar company ko america main kaaphi setbac mil rahaa he
 The US government feels that the Chinese company Huawei is acting as an agent of the Chinese government to spy on the US and because of this, US President Donald Trump has taken tough measures against Huawei
 america main huaave ko pehle se hi bain kiya gaya he, lekin ab Google ne huaave se android kaa license cancil kar diya he
 It was reported by the news agency Reuters and has since been confirmed
 huaave ke nae smartfones google eps or sarvice kaa bhi acces nahin milegaa
 It is possible that in Huawei's smartphones, access to Google Maps, youtube, Google Play Store and other important Google apps will also be discontinued
 isse huaave sahit company ke customers ko bada prabhaav pad saktaa he
 Although Google has not canceled Android's license for Huawei itself, Google is following the order of the US Department of Commerce
 google ke ek pravaktaa ne ek statement main kaha he, ‘ham aadesha kaa paalan kar rahe hai or ise rivyuu kar rahe hai
 Google Play Protect and Security Protection will continue to be given in Huawei's existing smartphones' This decision of Google will not make much difference in existing Huawei smartphones, but if the situation remains the same then surely the difficulties of Huawei smartphones users will increase
 google ke is faisle ke baad ab huaave Android Open Source Project yuj nahin kar paaegi
 This means that Google's apps and service will not be given in Huawei's phone in the coming time
 gauratlab he ki america president donald trump sarkaar kii taraf se lagaataar huaave par dabaav banaaya gaya he
 The reason for this is that the US fears that the Chinese government is taking the help of Huawei to spy on the US network
 america or huaave kii ladaai nai nahin he
 Last year, the US intelligence agencies were aware of the use of Huawei and ZTE devices, and American politicians have called Huawei a part of a Chinese government
 huaave kaa kahana ye he ki yah chini sarkaar ke liye sambhav hi nahin he ki wo unke divaais main jasusi ke liye kuch laga saken
 The company has expressed hope that business will slow down in the future
 kul mila kar abhi ke liye itnaa hi he ki karodon huaave smartphone yugers ke liye abhi mushkil bani hui
 Because it is still not clear what the impact will be on the users
 itnaa hi nahin aane vaale samay main huaave jo smartfones bechegi usamen company apana software degi yaa phir android ke saath license thik hone tak company phone launch nahin karegi
 Let us know that Huawei is also working on its operating system
 lekin android kii jo lokapriyata he use dekhte hue ye kah paanaa mushkil he ki bina android ke huaave smartfones kaa future kya hoga

 When questioned, he said that wait till the conclusion
 bataaya jaataa he ki mangalvaar ko ek baar phir aisi hi baithak ho sakati he
 Kumar Vishwas also tweeted after the meeting
 vishwaas ne likhaa, 'ham honge kaayyab'
 On Tuesday morning, Sanjay Singh made a tweet in this regard
 Good Morning
 Even after 3 hours of sleep, it is relaxed

 'gauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal bangaleru ke jindal nechuropathy centre se apni khaansee or madhumeh kii beemaari kaa ilaaj karwaakar laute hai
 Kejriwal, who reached Delhi on Monday night, appeared to be avoiding answering political questions
 raashtrapati or piem ko likhe is sandesh main dibaakar banerjee, anand patavardhan, paresh kaamada, nishtha jain, kirti nakhwa, harshavardhan kulkarni, hari nair, rakesh sharma, indranil lahiri or lipika singh daraai shaamil hai
 The Union Home Ministry has upheld the decision of Lt
 Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung in which the Lt
 Governor revoked the transfer of Home Secretary Dharampal in the Arvind Kejriwal government
 grahamantralay ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke paas dharmpal ko pad se hataane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The Ministry said that according to the All India Joint Services Cadre Rules, only the Ministry of Home Affairs can remove the Home Secretary from Delhi
 gauratlab he ki dharmpal ne dilli police ke joint kamishnar emke meena ko anti karpshan beuro (asibi) ke pramukh ke rup main niyukt kiye jane se sambandhit notification par hastakshar kiya tha
 On this, the Kejriwal government had issued an order to remove Home Secretary Dharampal from the post of Home Secretary and return it to the Home Ministry and also stopped the joining of the new ACB Chief MK Meena
 buudhvaar ko rajyapal najeeb jang ne dilli sarkaar ke home secretary dharmpal ke tabadale ko khaarij kar diya tha or kaha ki dharmpal or meena donon apane pad par bane rahenge
 In response to the Home Ministry order, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs and LG and said that Home Secretary Dharampal has been surrendered by the Delhi Government to the Union Home Ministry, which is the authority of the Delhi Government
 chitthee main kaha gaya he ki rajendra kumaar ko grih mantralay kaa atirikt prabhaar saunpa gaya he, jo sarkaar kaa adhikaar or saath hi jab bhi sarkaar regular grih sachiv kii niyukti ke liye grih mantralay ko vishwaas main lekar hi niyukti karegi
 There is a silver lining in the midst of this great pull of Modi and Kejriwal government
 khabar he ki kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ne kendriya swasthya mantralay ko chitthee likhakar iesces adhikari sanjeev chaturvedi ko dilli sarkaar main bhejne par enosi dene ke liye kaha he
 Let us tell you that Sanjeev Chaturvedi is the first officer whom the Kejriwal government first sought from the Center as soon as the Government was formed in Delhi, because Arvind Kejriwal himself wanted him to be a part of his team, but today it has been four months in the government files
 Moving in tippaniyan Though no final decision has been taken on sending Sanjeev Chaturvedi to the Delhi government, but if this happens, the relationship between the Center and the Delhi government may be a bit short and the Delhi government may also consider some of its recent decisions 
 kyonki ab yahi tarika rah gaya, jisase maamla kuch sulajh jaae varanaa to jab court main sunwaayee kii taarikh aegi tabhi court koi faisla le saktaa he, varanaa jaisaa chal rahaa he chalata rahegaa
 The Home Ministry said that the Delhi government did not have the right to remove Dharampal from the post
 mantralay ne kaha ki ol india joint services cader rules ke mutabik, sirf grih mantralay hi dilli ke home secretary ko pad se hataa saktaa he
 Significantly, Dharampal had signed a notification regarding the appointment of Joint Commissioner of Delhi Police MK Meena as the head of the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB)
 is par kejariwal sarkaar ne home secretary dharmpal ko grihasachiv ke pad se hataakar grahamantralay ko waapas lautaane kaa aadesh jari kar diya tha or nae asibi chif emke meena ko bhi jwine karne se roak diya tha
 On Wednesday, Governor Najib Jung rejected the transfer of Dharampal, the home secretary of the Delhi government, and said that both Dharam Pal and Meena would continue in their posts
 grih mantralay ke aadesh ke jawaab main dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ne grih mantralay or alji ko chitthee likhi or kaha ki grih sachiv dharmpal ko dilli sarkaar ne kendriya grahamantralay ko sarender kiya he, jo dilli sarkaar kaa adhikaar he
 The letter states that Rajendra Kumar has been given additional charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs, who will take the authority of the government as well as whenever the government appoints the Home Ministry for the appointment of the regular Home Secretary in confidence
 modi or kejariwal sarkaar kii is jabardast khinchataan ke bich vaise ek ummid kii kiran dikh rahi he
 It is reported that the Union Environment Ministry has written a letter to the Union Health Ministry asking it to give NOC on sending IFS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi to the Delhi government
 aapako bataa den ki sanjeev chaturvedi vah pehle afasar hai, jinako kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli main sarkaar banate hi sabase pehle centre se maanga tha, kyonki khud aravind kejariwal unako apni team kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate the, lekin aaj chaar maheene ho gaye yah maamla sarkari filon main gum rahaa he
 The comments haalanki sanjeev chaturvedi ko dilli sarkaar main bhejne par koi antim faisla nahin hua he, lekin agar aisa ho jaataa he to centre or dilli sarkaar ke rishton main talkhi kuch kam ho sakati he or dilli sarkaar bhi apane haal ke kuch faislon par vichaar kar sakati he
 Because now this is the way, so that the matter is resolved otherwise the court can take a decision only when the date of hearing in the court comes, otherwise it will go on as it goes

 There is also a feature in which the cameras of smartphones are far behind that is the feature of better optical zoom
 aise hi ek compact camere powershot SX740 HS ko canan ne haal hi main utaara tha
 We have used it and are now passing it on to you
 is camere kii keemat company ne 27,995 rakhaa he
 It has replaced the previous year's released powershot SX730 HS in Canon's portfolio
 dizin, spacifications or fitures:sabase pehle bataa den ye ek travel camera he
 Its biggest feature is its 40X optical zoom
 aapako yahaan itani optical juum ke alaava canan kaa jumplus feechar bhi milegaa jo aapako 80x digital juum degaa
 However, in this you will have to compromise image quality
 SX740 HS main 40x optic juum (24-960mm ke baraabar) ke alaava 20
 3MP 1 / 2
 3-tip (6
 17 x 4
 55 mm) back-iluminated CMOS sensor diya gaya he
 Apart from these specifications, the feature that makes this camera even more special is the feature of shooting 4K Ultra HD video
 yahaan aapako 4K timelaps mod bhi maujuud he
 In addition, it will also get five-axis image stabilization and Canon's latest Digic 8 processor, which will help you in the work like fast autofocus
 isaki ISO sensitivity range 80 se 3200 he
 However, in auto mode, you only have to satisfy in ISO 1600
 dizin kii baat karen to chunki ye ek compact camera to ise hold karnaa or saath main rakhana kaaphi aasaan he
 So it is a great option for street photography, where you will also get the facility of telephoto
 yahaan smartphone se shering ke liye wi-fi or bluetooth kaa bhi opshan he
 HDMI and micro USB port are available for connectivity
 aise main aap ise kisi tip-b charger se smartphone kii hi tarah aasaani se charge kar sakate hai
 Its overall look is simple, where you will find a lot of shooting modes
 haalanki aap apni ichha se photography karne ke liye minial mod ko hi zyada mahatv de sakate hai
 One problem is that in this you will not get the option to click photos in RAW
 video ke liye yahaan alag batan diya gaya he
 Similarly, the button has been given a separate space to turn on wi-fi
 iske back main 3
 There is a 0-inch screen that can be rotated up to 180 degrees
 yani iskaa phayda aap selfi lene ke liye kar sakate hai or isse aap puri tarah juum out hone ke baad ek acchhee wide selfi le bhi paaenge
 However, the evil of the screen is that it is not a touch screen
 joki 2018 ke lihaaj se thodi buree baat ho sakati he, lekin iskaa doosraa paksh ye he ki agar tach screen hota to isaki keemat bhi bad jaati
 Performance and Image Quality: Talking about its performance, it is quite quick
 jald se sabaject detect kar letaa he or autofocus kar letaa he
 But this thing will be applicable while taking wide angle shots in the day too
 yani jab aap puri tarah juum out hokar photose clic karenge tab aapako focus lock karne main aasaani hogi
 This burst shot or continuous shot performs very well due to the Digic 8 processor
 saath hi video kii parformens bhi bahut shandaar he
 In videos, you will get autofocus quite fast
 lekin jaise hi aap maximum juum par jaaenge aapako autofocus main samasya aane lagegi
 The worst thing here is that at such a time you cannot even select a single focus
 aapako phase and trekking, trekking AF yaa centre point kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 Because of this sometimes you can miss a good shot
 aamtaur par ham focus lock karne ke liye smartfones main screen par hi tap kar lete hai
 Here the screen is not even touch and does not provide autofocus in zoom, so there is a lot of problem
 sthiti tab or kharaab ho jaati he jab aap lo-lite condishan main juum karne lagate hai
 Here you will need to recompose the shot again and again
 yani kul milakar aap manachaaha focal point select nahin kar sakate
 As far as image quality is concerned, in daytime or full-light condition, the photo quality will be better, while in low-light condition you will get less sharpness and detail in photos
 or bahut zyada dark condishan main aap photo quality se bahut zyada niraash ho sakate hai
 Even in daylight, when you click photos in full 40x optical zoom, you will find the detailing of the image to be a bit missed
 zyada juum ke vakt koshish karen ki koi trypod saath ho varanaa photo bahut zyada shaike ho sakati hai
 Although image stabilization has been given to avoid this, despite this you will need to be careful
 ek acchhee baat ye he ki trypod ke saath aap shater speed kam kar or aparchar badhaakar lo-lite main bhi acchhee tasviir nikaal sakate hai
 But moving the shutter too slow will not be able to click moving objects, just like building will look very good
 baharhaal baat ye he ki bahut kam hi log point and shoot ke saath trypod yuj karnaa pasand karenge
 Because then he also has to carry
 jahaan tak image main color quality kii baat he to kaaphi behatar he
 Photo sample: The image has not been edited in any way
 keval web ke liye inhen risise kiya gaya he
 Verdict: Now the question is, should you take this camera? So the answer is that if you want a compact camera with a great zoom for travel or holiday or street photography / videography, then you can invest in it
 30fps par 4K video shoot karne kii kshamta bhi ek behtareen feechar he
 The drawbacks you have to keep in mind are that autofocus can disturb you in low-light or zoom conditions
 RAW main shoot karne kaa opshan nahin milegaa or tachascreen maujuud nahin he
 Apart from all this, low-light performance due to small sensor is also not good
 aise main yadi aap juum ko chhodkar image quality par zyada dhyaan dena chaahate hai wo bhi lo-lite condishan main to bazaar main maujuud duusare compact camere tri kar sakate hai

 After cutting vegetables and washing dishes where she writes

 Prakash Singh, who had prepared the report of Jat agitation in Haryana in February, had brought the flaws of the entire government system in Haryana to the country
 usee report kii vajah se aanan-fanan main haryana sarkaar ko kai afasaron par kaarywahi bhi kerani padi thi or sarkaar kii kaaphi fajihat bhi hui thi
 The Haryana government refused to prepare the report, perhaps because of this fear, the Haryana government has refused to prepare the second part of the report on the violence during the Jat agitation in Haryana
 sevanivrutt ipies prakaash singh kii adhyakshata vaali cameti ne apni pehlereportmen bataaya tha ki haryana main jat andolan ke dauraan kuch police ke adhikariyon ne aniyamitataayen barti
 The Ministry of Home Affairs had said- No need for the report
 Prakash Singh says that he was soon to start work on another report for which he had also called a meeting of police officers
 prakaash singh ne kaha ki vah kuch samay pehle haryana ke mukhyamantri se mili the or jab unhone mukhyamantri se duusari report kii baat kii to unhone kaha ki mujhe kuch din kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 But a few days later a letter was received from the Ministry of Home Affairs and it was said that a second report is not required
 singh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii ore se unhen report ko band karne ke peeche koi kaaran nahin bataaya gaya he
 More than 30 people died during the Prajaajat movement received for the first report
 saath hi sampati ko bhi baari nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 Prakash Singh says, "part-2 of my report is over
 sarkaar ne mujhe ek aupchaarik patr likhakar is baat ke liye dhanyavad diya he ki maine pehali report main saraahneey kaam kiya he
 Along with this, it has also been written in the letter that there is no longer a need for a second report on the violence during the Jat movement
 chal rahi he raajnneetiharyana vidhansabha kaa satr chal rahaa he or aise main is mudde par raajnneeti bhi shuru ho gai he
 The government defended itself saying that it was serious about this issue and the government has taken appropriate action on all the recommendations of the first report of the Prakash Singh Commission and there is no need for any further report
 congress ne haryana sarkaar par lagaae aaropawahin congress ne haryana sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki prakaash singh ayog kii pehali report par sarkaar ne kisi bhi bade afasar par koi kaarywahi nahin kii he or sirf lipapoti kii he
 For this reason, the government is also suppressing the second report of Prakash Singh and if the government was not to take this report then why was it made
 fajihat ke dar se batch rahi he sarkaar!prakaash singh ayog kii pehali report aane ke baad bhi sarkaar kii kaaphi fajihat hui thi or jamkar raajnneetik hamale haryana kii bijepi sarkaar ko jhelane pade the
 Perhaps in order to avoid the same disturbance and political attacks, the Haryana government is now afraid to come out with the second report and go public

 ek baat to aap maanenge ki ab android or ios kai myanon main ubaau ho rahe hai or smartphone ke hardkor yugers ko ek behatar oes kii zarurat he
 But when Nokia will be making a comeback in the market again in 2017, then users will obviously expect something better in it besides Android
 lekin unhen milegaa kya? android oparating system par chalane vaala nokia smartphone jisamen snapadragon kaa procesar, 4GB ram, 32GB memory or sambhawatah 16 megapixl kaa rier camera hoga
 You will hear such news daily in which smartphones with similar specifications and features are launched
 to kya nokia isliye phir se badshahath kaayam kar paaegi kyonki logon kii yaaden isse judi hai? mujhe to aisa bilkul nahin lagata
 Nokia may flop again due to these reasons! There are many reasons why Nokia flopped again
 udhaaharan ke taur parablakeberi ko hi le lijie
 When blackberry launched smartphones with its special operating system and started to flop, it felt that bringing back Android would regain the lost image
 lekin kya aisa hua? company ne ab tak teen android smartphone launch kar die hai
 Even a smartphone whose security was better than any Android smartphone in the world
 iske alaava blueberi hub jaise feechar jiske log hardkor fain hua karte the, in sab se blakebari ko koi phayda nahin hua
 You will have to get Nokia from Blackberry, you will be aware of the fate of Blackberry
 alam yah he ki company ne apana mobile bijness hameshaa ke liye band kar diya he
 However, other companies will make smartphones
 naam to vahi lekin kya vahi exparts ab bhi hai maujuud?ab phir se nokia par aate hai
 The specialty of Nokia was no more
 nokia echemadi global ke haathon bik chuki he
 The best designers and engineers from which Nokia touched the new dimension have either gone to Microsoft or started their own startup
 da varj ke tech exparts ne kaha he, aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki nokia kaa naam naam to vahi he lekin ab shaayad dakshata wo nahin rahi jo pehle thi'haalanki aisa nahin he ki nokia ko bazaar kaa andaja nahin he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the company has promised that the quality standards will be high, while the design and engineering will be better than others
 lekin ye kuch alag nahin he jo isse clear vinar kaa tag de sake
 Nokia has set a different standard around the world In 2012, Nokia launched the Lumia 920 with the claim that it is the world's most advanced smartphone
 isamen aisi tach screen di gai thi jise dastaane laga kar bhi yuj kiya ja saktaa tha
 Apart from this, its body was made of polycarbonate and aggressive colors were also given
 photography ke liye isamen pyor vyuu camera diya gaya jisamen optical image stebligeshan tha
 This smartphone ran on the Windows operating system
 us daur main jab camere main optical image stebligeshan kam hi companiyon detii thim
 In the same way, the specifications were different, but still you know what happened to Nokia
 ab kya android laane se nokia phir se puraani nokia ban jaaegi?aipal or samsung ke market share main lagaani hogi send!maujuuda daur main aipal or samsung do aisi companiyaan hai joduniya bhar main behatar spacification ordizin vaale smartphone launch kar rahi hai
 Note that we are not talking about Motorola, Xiaomi, Lenovo and One Plus, because they are also not less than anyone
 phir bhi nokia ko agar android ke saath dubaara vaapasi kerani he to use aipal or samsung ke market share main send lagaana hoga
 And this seems quite difficult in this era
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki nokia android ke saath vaapasi karne ke baad phir vaapasi to kar legi, lekin doum darje ke smartphone hi kehalaaegi
 Which would be neither better for Nokia nor for us
 kyonki nokia se ek rishta sa bana hua he
 We know the Nokia that brought unique phones like the n Series to the 6600 which were number-1 in everything from design to feature
 logon ko sirf alag nahin number-1 handset kii he ummidjaahir log bhi yahi ummid lagaae baithe hai ki phir se number-1 jaisaa hi maamla ho
 Nokia again brought such phones which are not only different from others in terms of design, feature and quality but also number-1
 or logon kii ummid kar par khara utarane ke liye mujhe nahin lagata ki sirf android laane bhar se nokia kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 For this, you have to bring different design and quality which people have not experienced before
 baharhaal ham ummid karte hai ki nokia aipal or samsung ko kadi takkar de taaki or aisa smartphone launch kare jise rivyuu karne main majaa aa jaae
 These days i may be bored by writing and reviewing about the same type of smartphone

 Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar! This name is not an idea
 vah soch he jisane bharat main sabase pichde samaaj ko bharat ke mukhya dhara main laane kaa kaam kiya
 Even after decades of independence, the Dalit remained deprived of the mainstream of society, but the change comes slowly and today India stands at the turning point of that change, when the Dalit does not refrain from calling himself a Dalit but throws it on him
 aaj ham aapako bataate hai bharat main daliton ke us gaanv ke bare main jahaan dalit apane naam par fakhr karata he or jahaan usne apni hifaazat ke liye apni hi jati kii yuvaaon kii sena khadi kii he
 Saharanpur district of UP is about 180 kilometers from the capital of the country, and Ghadkauli village is situated in one corner of the same Saharanpur
 yah gaanv isliye bhi khaas he or isliye praasangik bhi he kyonki ambedkar ke janmdiwas par isse yah pataa chalata he ki bharat kaa dalit ab dabaa or kuchlaa nahin he
 You will get an idea of this as soon as you step foot in Ghadkauli village, where the sign board outside the village says- 'the Great Chamar Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar Village Ghadkauli welcomes you
 'daliton ke liye 'chamaar' shabd kaa istemaal jatisuchak aparaadh mana jaataa he or bharat kii dand samhita ke anusaar is shabd kaa istemaal karne par aapako sajaa bhi ho sakati he, lekin ghadkauli gaanv ke dalit is shabd par etraj nahin balki fakhr mahasoos karte hai
 The Dalits of this village are not ashamed of their identity and their caste
 isi gaanv ke rahane vaale munish kehete hai ki jab gaanv main kheti bhi dalit karata he saare kaam dalit hi karata he to aakhir use apane naam or apni jati ke naam par sharminda kyon hona
 More than 800 Dalit families live in Ghadkauli village with a population of more than a thousand, it is the result of the solidarity of the Dalits that the villagers gave this village the name 'the Great Chamar', but for this name they also paid a big price Was lying is naam kii vajah se hi is gaanv ne saal 2016 main jaateey sangharsh bhi dekha he, lekin sangharsh ke baad bhi gaanv khadaa he or shaan se duniya ko apni pahchaan dikhaa rahaa he
 This village, created to provide justice to the Dalits, is not only this village, it is special that the army protecting the village was created for the social justice of the Dalits with respect to Ambedkar's ideas and even today, they have come out of this village in the surrounding areas

 is gaanv main bani fouj he-bhim army
 Most of the boys of the village are part of this 'bhima Army'
 vaise to bhim army ne apana kaam daliton ko saamaajik insaaf dilaanaa bataaya he or yah baba sahab ambedkar ke samvidhan main vishwaas karti he, lekin iske saath kuch vivaad bhi jud gaye hai
 The 23-year-old Tinku Buddhist detergent powder is stained by Ghadkauli scandal on Daman and is the village chief of Bhima Army in Ghadkauli village
 daliton kii ladaai ladane ke liye tinku farvari 2016 main bhim army kaa hissaa ban gaye
 There was a lot of ruckus in IS Village in April 2016 when a dispute arose over the same board of the village between two castes
 maamla jaateey hisa tak pahunch gaya, jiske baad police dwaara lathi charge bhi kiya gaya
 After that incident, the Dalits of this village united and since then the number of members of Bhima Army has increased considerably
 aaj is gaanv main bhim army ke 700 se zyada sadsy hai or unka daawa he ki vah daliton ke saamaajik haq ke liye ladaai lard rahe hai
 The villagers of Ghadkouli are still unable to forget
 aarope he ki duusari jati ke logon ne pehle gaanv ke naam vaale is board ko kaali syaahi se rang diya or uske baad gaanv main lagi ambedkar kii pratimaa par bhi syaahi potee
 The villagers allege that all this was done by the bullies and the police did not listen to the villagers even on the complaint
 halaat sudhare or gaanv main phir se 'da great chamaar gram' kaa board har aane-jane vaale kaa swaagat karata he
 The Bhima Army became the face of the solidarity of the Dalits, after which not only men, but also women of the village have no fear of security
 bhim army apane samudaay ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane kaa daawa karti he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the army of this village would also break the law? 23-year-old Ashwini is a Dalit and a plumber by profession
 pichley saal hi vah bhim army main shaamil ho gaye or daawa karte hai ki yah kadam unhone daliton ko barabari kaa haq or nyaay dilaane ke liye uthaaya
 The full name of this Bhima Army is - 'bhima Army Bharat Ekta Mission', which was formed by Advocate Chandrashekhar Azad
 july 2015 main is bhim army kaa gathan kiya gaya tha, lekin april 2016 main is gaanv main hui jaateey hinsa ke baad bhim army pehali baar surkhiyon main ai
 Advocate Chandrashekhar is a resident of the same village of Azadpas and many Dalit youths have been joined by Chandrashekhar's Bhima Army, who claim to fight for the Dalits
 chandrashekhar kaa bhi daawa he kii bhim army kaa makasad daliton kii suraksha or unka haq dilvaanaa he, lekin iske liye vah har tareeke ko aajamaane kaa daawa bhi karte hai jo desh ke kanoon ke khilaaf bhi he
 The Great Chamar Village is an example of this in the 21st century, which shows that Dalit no longer feels ashamed of his caste but he considers his caste to be his strength and is proud of his identity

 Obviously, AAP mlas will remain the biggest beneficiaries of this, but now Chief Minister Kejriwal's three-year-old tweets are causing trouble in increase in salary
 ye twit kejariwal ne us samay netaaon par tanj kasate hue kiye the
 In March 2012, Kejriwal had tweeted, "in the last 44 years, political parties have not been able to reach a consensus on the Lokpal issue, but when it comes to increasing their salary, they decide in 5 minutes
 ' bataa den ki 2012 main kejariwal ne ye twit lokapal kii maang ko lekar sirf ek samajasevi ke rup main kiye the
 After this, at the end of the year 2012, Kejriwal formed a political organization called Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 unhone raajnneetik dal banaate samay bhi kaha tha ki vah raajnneeti ko badalane ke liye aae hai or puraane netaaon kii tarah kuch nahin karenge
 But now the mlas of his own party want his salary to increase

 If this recommendation is accepted, then the mlas of Delhi will be paid more than the mlas of any state of the country

 vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki apana ghar or offis chalaane ke liye unhen philhal jo selary milti he vah naakaafi he
 Although Kejriwal remains very active on Twitter, he has not spoken or tweeted yet in terms of salary hike of mlas
 unki party ke varisht netaa ashutosh ne mangalvaar raat jarur ek twit kiya, jisamen likhaa tha - 'kisi bha party ke eemaandaar vidhayak ke liye is alp selary main ghar, offis or apane vidhansabha kshetra kaa sanchaalan karnaa naammumkin he
 The dishonest do not even need a salary
 ' On Wednesday, Youth Congress leaders gathered outside Kejriwal's house in large numbers to protest against the increase in salary of mlas
 bataa den ki isi saal farvari main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai thi
 BJP has three members in the assembly and this party is also opposing the increase in salary of mlas
 tippaniyan BJP leader and one of the three mlas, Vijender Gupta, says that the AAP has now become a 'khasan Aadmi Party'

 iske baad vaartaon par dhyaan kendrit kiya jayega
 After three days of hectic negotiations over a complex draft agreement of 54 pages, the negotiators released a relatively small document, but there is no consensus yet to be reached about the nearly 250 undetermined options in the draft
 urja paidaa karne ke liye koyale kaa upbhog badhaane kii apni yojana ko lekar nishane par liye gaye bharat ne navikarniya urja se bijli kii laagat ko ghataane ke liye antarrashtriya sahyog maanga he taaki yah nishchit ho sake ki desh main urja ke bade hisse kii aapurti is kshetra se ho

 "we want a partnership and the International Solar Alliance (ISA) is one such example that will help us grow in that direction," Mathur said on the third day of the talks
 ’’ baar-baar yah puche jane par ki kya urja paidaa karne ke liye koyale kaa istemaal karne kii bharat kii yojana kaa asar kisi bhi tarah se vaartaon par pad rahaa he, maathur ne kaha ki yah baat nahin he
 Mathur said, "it will not affect the negotiations
" ham ek aise samaaj main rahete hai jahaan ham main se prayek apane kaaryon ke liye jimmedaar he
 It is important that we put forward our view
 ham sabhi bharatiyon kii urja jaruraton ko puraa karnaa chaahate hai
 "we are trying to meet the increasing energy needs from renewable sources," he said
 isse jo puraa nahin ho paaegaa use koyale se puraa kiya jayega
 After a period the share of renewable sources will decrease as the share of renewable sources increases
 navikarniya urja nayi cheez he
 We are paying attention to that

 Rahul said, 'shivji's photo has the symbol of Congress, then i thought that brother, i see another photo, i saw the photo of Guru Nanak, it has the symbol of Congress, i saw the photo of Buddha, it has the symbol of Congress, Mahavir Saw the photo of Zee, it has the Congress symbol, saw the photo of Hazrat Ali Ji, it has the Congress symbol '

 "when asked about other actors who like acting, Nawaz said," i do not admire the actors

 i watched the Hong Kong film 'in the mood for love' and i was stunned by Tony Leung's performance
 mujhe lagata he ki 'bardman' main mishael kiton kaa abhinay shandaar tha, lekin mujhe 'da wolf of da walstreet' main leonardo dicapriyo kaa abhinay sabase zyada pasand he
