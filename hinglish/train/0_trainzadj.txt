 com / jez9oqsc2v madhya pradesh main bhaajapa is baar whatsap ke jariye apni chunavi naiya paar lagane kii jugat main he
 For this, the party has prepared a team of workers along with Ardha Panna chief at 65,000 booths in the state
 inke paas booth ke votaron ke mobile number hai, jinhen inhone watsap se jod rakhaa he
 Through these whatsapp groups, BJP workers will appeal to the people of the region to vote in favor of their party
 bhaajapa madhya pradesh main hone walevidhansabha chunaavamein karnataka formule ko apana rahi he
 To form a government for the fourth time in the state, BJP has made a micro management plan like Karnataka
 bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ke mutabik iske liye party ne booth str par panna pramukh ko to niyukt kiya hi he, saath hi kaaryakartaaon ko har ghar har jan tak pahunchane ke liye ardh panna pramukhon kii bhi niyukti kii he or ek-ek kaaryakarta ko 10-10 parivaar kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 There are about 65,000 booths in Madhya Pradesh
 aise main bijepi ne har booth kii janata ko party ke paksh main karne ke liye apane kaaryakartaaon ko tainaat kar diya he
 These activists have kept whatsapp groups from voters' mobile numbers at every booth
 inhen watsap group ke jariye bhaajapa chunavi prachaar kar rahi he
 In Madhya Pradesh, whether there is a social media war between political parties or the praise of your party
 
 
 sab watsap ke jariye ho rahaa he
 Whatsapp has also become the perfect weapon for all political parties to create statements and atmosphere against opponents
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi is baar watsap ke jariye janata ke voton main send lagane kii taiyaari main he
 In Madhya Pradesh, BJP has deployed two activists along with the Panna Pramukh on one page of each booth's voter list
 ye kaaryakarta apane hisse ke 10 parivaar yani takreeban 30 matadaataaon se ghar-ghar jaakar sampark bana rahe hai
 The voters are being made aware of the merits of the BJP by these in-charges
 isi kadi main panna pramukhon ne sabhi matadaataaon ke mobile number jutakar unhen whatsap group se jod liya he, jinke jariye bhaajapa kii uplabdhiyaan bataai ja rahi hai
 At the same time, the Congress has objected to this bjp's election bet
 madhya pradesh congresske varisht netaa maanak agarwal ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi watsap ke jariye madhya pradesh kaa maahaul kharaab karne kii koshish kar rahi he or chunaav se pehle isaki sambhaavna pehle se hi jataai ja rahi he
 Earlier, this micro management formula of Amit Shah's Karnataka brought BJP closer to power
 yahi vajah he ki is baar amit shah kaa formula 'meraa booth sabase majboot' par bijepi kaam karti dikh rahi he
 Five years later, the Indian Air Force's finally identified Surya Kiran aerobatic team has returned, with a new aircraft hawk
 is baar vayusena diwas ke maukey phir se dikhenge jabanj najaare
 Four of his aircraft will show more exciting feats in the sky
 suryakiran ke commanding officer wing commander ajit kulkarni kehete hai, 'puraane kidan vimaan kii tulana main hoque kaaphi advance he
 It is very fast and agile
 pehle suryakiran team intermediat jet trainer kiran kaa istemaal karti thi
 They used to fly the formation of nine aircraft
 baad main jab payalton ke training ke liye vimaan kam pade to iskaa pradarshan band kar ise training ke kaam main laga diya gaya
 Now that the new aircraft have arrived, the Suryakaran team has returned
 ' par aasmaan main kartab dikhaanaa aasaan nahin he
 There is a huge difference between flying a common fighter aircraft and flying in a Suryakiraan team
 wing commander sahil gandhi kehete hai, 'fiter flying main ham itane kareeb fli nahin karte hai or isamen koi galati kii gujainsh nahin he
 ' 27 may 1996 ko bidar main suryakishan team kaa gathan kiya gaya or phir 1998 main bengaluru main hue airsho ke dauraan isane apana jalawaa dikhaaya
 After that its steps did not stop
 aage badhate chale gaye, srilanka se lekar singapore tak iske 450 se zyada sho hue
 Then also came the period when Aero India 2011 proved to be its last flight
 lekin jab isi saal farvari main phir suryakiran team ke banane kii baat hui to kuch payalat puraane team main se or kuch naye payalat rakhe gaye
 Kiran aircraft used to perform tricks in the range of 450 to 500 kilometers, whereas in the hawk, these feats have to be done at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour
 ye zyada der tak hawa main ud saktaa he, iske avionix kaaphi achche hai
 The aircraft had a control manual and hydraulic in it
 par ek baat kidan vimaan main khaas thi, wo ye ki ye dhime gati kaa vimaan hone kii vajah se iske karname aasaani se dekhe ja sakate the lekin hoque main ye sambhav nahin
 Then be prepared to see the professional style of the Indian Air Force through these aircraft, whose iron world believes
 suryakiran team ke vimaan par surya ke kirnon kii tarah naarangi dhaariyaan bani hai jo iske naam ko sarthak karti hai
 Then be prepared to see the professional style of the Indian Air Force through these aircraft, whose iron world believes

 film main sushant singh rajput or kriti sinan ko saath main lekar punarjanm ke rishton par aadhaarit lav stroy taiyaar kii gai he
 There was also a lot of controversy that this is a copy of South's film 'magadheera'
 lekin wo cese bhi rabta ke paksh main aayaa

 Especially the style of conversation of the characters of that era is quite confusing which one has to listen very carefully
 in kirdaaron ko or behatar tareeke se sajaayaa ja saktaa tha
 While watching the film, you feel that the makers wanted something else but by the time they became something else, due to which there was a special need to work on the screenplay

 Suddenly two strangers get into a conversation in a chocolate store
 kahani shahar se tapu par pahunchati he

 Siang River water is not considered suitable for use

 India has expressed strong opposition to the statement of England Foreign Minister David Milliband

 Milband, who visited India, in his statement tried to link the issue of terrorism with Kashmir

 ab unke kahe par rajanyik galiyaaron main koharaam machaa gaya he
 The Prime Minister has clearly told England that the way Milliband has tried to relate the issue of terrorism to the Kashmir issue, India is not at all tolerant

 Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee has said that India has done whatever it had to do on the issue of Milliband
 sarkaar kaa etraj is baat par bhi he ki milband ne aatankwaad par apane agenda ko bharat par thopane kii koshish kii
 Milliband had said that the resolution of the Kashmir issue would help Pakistan in tackling the Taliban and Al Qaeda threat on its western border, which is the real root of terrorism
 lekin milliband ye bhul gaye al-kaayda or taliban jaise america or england ke liye khatra hai usee tarah lashkar auki jaish jaise sanghathan bharat ke liye auki in sanghathanon kaa kisi bhi masale se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 However, England has now clarified through its High Commissioner that Milliband did not intend to justify terrorism by linking it to any issue

 das ke mutabik is baat kii sambhaavna ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki beete 35 dinon ke dauraan lagaataar jamaa ho rahi 500 rupee or 1000 rupee kii karency ko kuch jagahon par do baar gin liya gaya ho
 Therefore, all banks need to once again do the task of counting the currency afresh so that an accurate assessment of the old currency can be done
 yah farmaan guuruuvaar ko rigerv bank ke bayaan ki 9 november se abhitak 5 lakh karod rupee kii nai karency jari kii ja chuki he ke baad aayaa
 Most of the issued currency was in 2000 rupee notes

 Now, to give priority to the new currency of 500 rupees, it is to increase liquidity by curbing hoarding of new currency in the country

 Arya initially denied this, but he became angry when he came to know that Minisha had shared the conversation between the two contestants of Bigg Boss on their phone
 arya ne kaha 'mai sho main is bare main kii gai baton se anjaan tha
 When Salman asked me about this, i was very upset that Minisha had told our private things to everyone

 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvinj Kejriwal is likely to appear in Patial House Court today in the defamation lawsuit of former BJP president Nitin Gadkari
 nitin gadakari kii arji par sunwaayee karte hue court ne kejariwal ko 21 may tak pesh hone kaa aadesh diya tha
 Significantly, on January 31, Kejriwal released a list of India's most corrupt people, in which Gadkari was also named
 pulavama aatanki hamale ke gunaahagaar or bharat kaa dushman number ek jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood ajahar ko sabak sikhaane ke liye bharat har koshish kar rahaa he
 Masood is in Pakistan and India has now begun to surround Pakistan on the world stage
 agle kuch dinon main hone vaali sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad kii baithak main bharat masood ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit karwaane kii koshish karegaa
 Not only this, India will also tell the world that Masood Azhar is a threat only to us
 ek angreji akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik, bharat ke saath-saath france ne bhi sanyukt raashtra main iskaa prastaav diya he
 Actually, not only jaish-e-mohammed, India will tell the world that the US banned Ban harkat-ul-ansar (hua) is the parent body of Jaish
 america ke hua ko bain karne ke baad jaish ke antargat hi aatankiyon ko training di ja rahi thi
 Significantly, India has been demanding action on Jaish many times before, but this could not happen due to China's veto power in UNSC
 ab pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad puri duniya bharat ke saath khadi he, jiskaa laabh bharat uthaanaa chahta he
 Masood Azhar was a part of harkat-ul-ansar in 1994 and was on a mission to Jammu and Kashmir, but was caught in India
 jab 1999 main yahaan se chuta to usne jaish-e-mohammad banaaya, balakot main jis adde ko bharat ne tabah kiya he ki vah jaish kaa sabase bada training camp mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, India will now try to tell the world that it is not that Jaish is only a threat to India and it wants to spread terror in Kashmir itself
 balki harakat-ul-ansaar ke jariye vah america, europe jaise kshetron ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 jaish-e-mohammad is responsible for the attacks on Pulwama, Pathankot and Parliament in India
 america khufia agency siie kii ek report kii maane to pakistan kii agency ISI hi harakat-ul-ansaar ko lagaataar funding karata rahaa he, jo jaish-e-mohammad kii parent sanstha he
 This CIA report is sufficient to prove India's argument
 pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad se hi bharat ne kootnithik taur par duniyabar main pakistan ko gherne kii koshish kii, jab bharat ne pakistan main ghuskar airstrike kii to yahi kaaran rahaa ki kisi ne bharat kii ore awaz nahin uthaai
 Rather, India itself informed all the countries that our country has entered Pakistan and taken action against terrorism
 jiske baad kai deshon ne pakistan ko latad lagaai

 dilli kii ek adaalat ne kaha ki police adhikari aarope patr main jaan-boojhkar kamiyaan chhodte hai, taaki gambhir aparaadh main shaamil aropiyon ko chhodane ko adaalatein baadhya hon or is prakaar nyaaypalika badnaam hoti he
 The court's remarks came during the discharge of an allegation of a Transport Department official in a corruption case in which he said that the chargesheet was filed in a very lame manner by officials of the Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) of the Delhi government
 adaalat ne kaha ki jis tareeke se aarope patr daayar kiya gaya, usase lagata he ki saamagree kii asibi ke nireekshak rakesh kumaar or sahaayak police ayukta mahendra paal ne jaan-boojhkar chaanbin nahin kii
 Special Judge Himani Malhotra said, "it is not the case that these senior officers of ACB are not aware of the nuances of criminal legal system
 aarope patr bilkul saaf saboot detaa he ki kuch kamiyaan aarope patr main paroksh manshaa se jaanboojhkar chodi jaati hai taaki adaalaton ko laachaar banaaya jaae or vah majaboor hokar bhrashtachar jaise gambhir aparaadh main shaamil aropiyon ko aarope mukt kar den, bari kar den
 Corruption is not only destroying the moral fabric of the society, but is also maligning the judiciary and our country for long prosecutions and ultimately, in a large number of cases of corruption, the accused are acquitted
 ' tippaniyan The court discharged Transport Department official Rajiv Kumar Arora from the offense under the Prevention of Corruption Act as there was not enough material to take action against him
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 adaalat kii tippanee parivahan vibhaag ke ek adhikari ko bhrashtachar ke ek maamle main aarope mukt karne ke dauraan ai, jisamen usne kaha ki aarope patr dilli sarkaar kii bhrashtachar nirodhak shakha (asibi) ke adhikariyon ne behad lachar tareeke se daakhil kii
 The court said that the manner in which the charge sheet was filed shows that ACB inspector Rakesh Kumar and Assistant Commissioner of Police Mahendra Pal did not deliberately investigate the contents
 vishesh nyaayadhish himani malhotra ne kaha, 'yah maamla nahin he ki asibi ke in varisht adhikariyon ko aapraadhik kanoonee pranali ke baarik bhed kii jaankaree nahin he
 The charge sheet gives very clear evidence that some deficiencies are intentionally omitted in the charge sheet so that the courts are made helpless and that they are forced and acquitted of the accused involved in serious crime like corruption, acquitted
 bhrashtachar na sirf samaaj ke naitik taana-bana ko khatm kar rahaa he, balki nyaaypalika or hamaare desh ko bhi lanbaa mukadmaa chalaane ke liye badnaam kar rahaa he or aakhirkaar bhrashtachar ke badi sankhya main maamalon main aaropee bari ho jate hai
 Comments court ne parivahan vibhaag ke adhikari rajeev kumaar aroda ko bhrashtachar nirodhak adhinium ke tahat aparaadh se aarope mukt kar diya kyonki uske khilaaf karrwai ke liye paryaapt saamagree nahin thi

 kharbanda @nadiadwalagrandson @foxstarhindia post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on May 20, 2019 at 12:24am pdtakraya kumaar (akshay Kumar)ne tasviir ko post karte hue likhaa, house phul of throns (house Full Of Thrones), koun jeeta he or koun marataa he ye to sirf screept hi dyside karti he
 Please tell these days, Akshay Kumar is busy shooting for 'housefull 4'
 'housephul 4' housephul siries kaa chauthaa part he
 Earlier, all the parts of the houseful series are super hit at the box office
 'housephul' 4 kaa nirdesan farhaad samaji karne vaale hai to isko sajid nadiadwala produs karenge
 It is being told that Housefull 4 will be released on October 25 this year on the occasion of Diwali
 phans ko bhi is film kaa besabri se intjaar he
 The Secret Superstar, released on Diwali, is seen to gain a lot of public acclaim
 ek maamuli shahar ke ladki kii kahani ko darshakon ke alaava critics ne beshumaar pyaar diya
 Critics even called it different from the film Mango Mumbai Masala
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki ye apane daur kii behtareen film he
 Leaving aside the message of the film and the acting of the actors, the flaws present in it make it an average film 
 parfections or alag tarah ke pishan ke liye mashhoor aamir khan kii film main ise dekhne kii naa ke baraabar gunjaaish rahati he
 The flaws in the story of a good film and the average climax make it a simple story
 baroda kii ek 15 saal kii ladki insiya (jaayra wasim) board exam dene vaali he
 He is an amazing singer and guitarist
 uskaa sapana superstar bananaa he
 The story is as much as Insiya's as much as Najma's (meher Vij) who is a common household woman
 jise tivi khaskar mujeec reality shoj dekhnaa behad pasand he
 She is a scared woman confined in her apartment who is very concerned about children
 pati se pitane or uski soch ke khilaaf chhip-chhipaakar beti main apana aksh talashne vaali aurat
 Insia's struggle and Najma's struggle to get out of the traditional limits is the focus of the story
 najma kaa ejeeniyar pati (raaj arjuna) bhi he
 According to the story, he is as cruel and emotionless as he should be
 budhi aapa, insiya kaa bhai guddu, insiya kaa boyfriend or flop muneecian shakti kumaar bhi hai
 Things that prove the secret superstar to be a common story # 1) The scene of award ceremonies in the climax was very unnecessary
 rone-dhone se pataa nahin kab hindi filmein mukt hongi
 It has also become very dramatic in Secret Super Star
 yah tab or bura lagata he jab puri film main behtareen acting karne vaali jaayra wasim ke chehre par wo bhav hi najar nahin aate jab wo ise kar rahi hoti hai
 His acting while running off the stage seems very fake
 film airport par hi khatm kar deni chahie thi
 # 2) The story is new, well filmed
 kaaphi tej bhi
 But there is also a bag in the story
 is vajah se ye ek behtareen script hote-hote rah gai
 As soon as the mother gets a computer in her hands, Insia uploads songs to youtube overnight and becomes a hit in a single day
 chijen viral ek hi din main hoti hai lekin is plat ke filmakan main insiya ke bal man kii jo jaddojahad he use bahut kam vakt diya gaya
 In the midst of the incident of becoming a singing sensation on youtube in a much longer-than-average film, Insia should have been given a little more time
 lekin jaise jis tarah se 90 ke dashak kii aam mumbaiya filmon main hota aayaa he (kuch filmon main ghar kii garibi se tang hero ek hi seen main karodpati ban jaataa he
 Or the hero in the world of revenge crime becomes the big gangster of the city overnight
 ) sikret superstar bhi usase bachaai nahin ja saki
 This 'magical' fast is unbroken
 Review: diarector kii film he sikret superstar, dangal ke baad aamir ko dekhnaa dilachasp # 3) insiya ke skool se bhagkar mumbai pahunchane or recording kaa plat bhi kareeb-kareeb aisa hi he
 That is, the victim of 'magical' fast
 shakti kumaar ke studio main insiya kaa gaanaa na ga sakane or toilet main uske man ke bheetar umadte samandar ko chhod den to yahaan bhi sikret superstar aam masala film jaisi lagati he
 Since the acting and editing in the film is so effective that while watching it, there is no time to think these things
 par ye dangal jaisi nahin he jahaan kahani main yatharth kaa kaaphi dhyaan rakhaa gaya tha
 These are two such pillars of the story on which the entire film stands
 yahaan zyada baariki kii jarurat thi isse insiya kaa apana sangharsh or bada canvas paata
 # 4) To inform Insiya about her birth by old Apa is to serve a fact contrary to the original soul of the story
 kahani ke mutabik insiya kaa ejeeniyar pita ek muslim rudhivaadee purush he jo apni beti ko padhaa-likhaakar board exam ke baad shaadi riyaad main shaadi karaane kii soch rahaa he
 How does such a stereotypical man let his wife, who was missing for 10 months, come back home? In fact, in the film's story, old Apa tells Insia that when she was carrying her father, Najma wanted to be abused
 lekin najma aspataal se bhaag jaati he or 10 maheene baad jab ghar lautati he to uski god main insiya hoti he
 Then Insiya's father lets her come back, on the condition of not having another daughter
 aamir bole- jab jaayra darshakon ko khinchne main safal hogi, tab use mujhase zyada fees milegikahani kaa ye sira ek rudhivaadee purush ke charitra ke mutabik sahi nahin tha
 One can think of it as much as a sensible one, as the three Idiots had to have rakes delivered by jugaad
 film ke nirdeshak advait chandan jinhone khud isaki kahani bhi likhi he, wo ise kisi or behatar tareeke bhi bataa sakate the
 This does not affect the soul of the story
 # 5) soshal consarn ke liye filmein banane vaale aamir khan ne jane-anjaane ek badi bhul bhi film main kar di he
 Actually, the way Insia uses the internet till three in the night after spending a laptop from her mother and spends time on social sites, it is wrong to show her
 jab vah in chizon ko apni maa kii sahmati or dekharekh main kar rahi he to ek kishor ke internet istemaal karne kaa plat kisi or tarah se filmana chahie tha
 These scenes have become a bad influence on the children of teenage minds
 vaise bhi un pariwaron main aisi dikkat dekhne main aa rahi he jahaan bachche der raat internet par vakt bitaa rahe hai
 # 6) If Insia has full support of her mother, there was no need to show her running away from home alone without telling her
 film main kai kaam ke liye uske pita ghar se baahar dikhaae gaye hai, aise main shakti kumaar kaa koi aadmi use baroda se pick-drops karata to kahani par zyada fark nahin padataa
 In the meantime, Insia's meeting with Loire Reena on the divorce of her mother could be filmed
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 The possibility of dropout of Kishore Mana from the scene of the film cannot be dismissed
 'taare jameen par' jaisi sarthak film banane vaale aamir se aisi ummid to nahin thi

 The by-election in Samastipur Lok Sabha seat has to be attributed to the demise of Lok Janshakti Party MP Ramchandra Paswan
 aapako bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main vipakshi mahagathbandhan 40 siton main se sirf ek seat jeet paaya tha
 By-elections are also to be held on 21 October in Samastipur Lok Sabha seat of Bihar
 iske chunaav parinaam bhi 24 oktober ko jari kiye jaaenge

 rajasthan kii vasundhara raaje sarkaar main praathmik shiksha rajya mantri vasudev devnani rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke pratinidhi hai, jinhen philhal bhartiya janata party samarthan dena chaahati he
 An electrical engineer by profession, 66-year-old Devanani is balancing the bjp's agenda of incorporating Hindu culture into modernity, necessary reforms and education
 america sahaayta se ajmer ko smart city banane ke kaam kii dekharekh bhi unke jimme he
 Devnani became MLA for the third time
 vidambnaa hi he ki ajmer kii sthaneey raajnneeti main aresas virdohi lobby ke dabaav ke kaaran unhen mantrimandal main shaamil karne main ek saal kii deree hui or cabinet kaa darja dene ke liye unki varishthata ko nazarandaaj kar unhen sirf praathmik shiksha kaa swatantra prabhaar de kar rajya mantri banaaya gaya
 He has previously done a good job as the Minister of Technical Education
 tamaam dabaavon se achoote rah kar unhone sanskrit main shapath lee
 In the second expansion, he was probably the only minister who did not touch Raje's feet
 par mukhyamantri ne bhagava agenda sahit unke prastaavon ko manjuuri di
 "I am following the Chief Minister's thinking for better school education," says Devanani
 ''devnani ne pehle skulon ko nirdesh die ki ve vasant panchami par vasantotsav manaane kii bajaae vir hakeekat raay ke balidaan se jude aayojan karen jo islam apnaane se inkaar karte hue shahid hue the
 Devnani also got the children to sing Saraswati Vandana in schools that day
 uske baad unhone rajasthan madhyamik shiksha board kii pathyapustakon kii samiksha kaa aadesh bhi diya
 He says that these books were written by activists who were in favor of anti-hinduism and leftists
 unhone india today se baat karte hue pichhali congress sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki usne hindu virdohi agenda apana kar paathya pustaken likhwain
 His question was, "why should there be a text on Akbar the Great? "they will have Maharana Pratap recited in his place
 to kya unki soch muslim virdohi he? ''nahin, ham paathya pustakon main akbar ko uchit sthaan denge
 "the Sangh has always said that Maharana Pratap should get more respect than Akranta Akbar
" devnani skulon main rojaanaa yoga, dhyaan or surya namaskara bhi karvaa rahe hai
 He dismisses all criticisms that these steps are Hindu beneficial, saying, "they are considered beneficial for health all over the world
" bhala har kisi ko urja dene vaale surya ko sirf hinduon kaa kaise mana ja saktaa he? '' unka kahana he ki 40,000 skulon ke liye unke paas shaareerik shiksha ke sirf 4,500 shikshak hai
 They now have the support of four lakh teachers who will voluntarily teach this to the children
 devnani shiksha adhikaar adhinium main bhi sanshodhan chaahate hai kyonki vartmaan swaroop main badi sankhya main bachche sarkari skulon se nikal kar nijee skulon main gaye hai jahaan sarkaar unka kharch detii he
 He has reviewed the entire system by merging the schools with less than thirty children to the nearest major school and re-opened 2,500 hastily closed schools
 in skulon ko band karne kii badi aalochana hui thi
 "in the end, we might merge only 8,000 schools into better-equipped schools," he says
 ''idhar kuch dinon se nijee skulon ko atiyogy chaatro ke liye muft laptop or tablet yojana se baahar rakhe jane ke unke faisle kii bahut aalochana hui he
 They say that they are willing to include some private schools and some students who have scored the highest marks in the CBSE board
 raaje ne 186 nae model skulon kaa namakaran vivekanand ke naam par karne or adarsh skulon main vaai-fi tathaa computer kii suvidha dene ke unke suzav ko manjuuri de di he
 They are currently working on a network system through which they can monitor the number of teachers and students in every school
 shiksha board ke sadasyon kii niyukti main sarkaar kii ore se deree jaisi rukaawaton ke kaaran unka kaam dhimaa ho rahaa he lekin saadagi pasand devnani sabase charchit mantri ho gaye hai

 The Delhi government has talked about permitting guest teachers
 agar aisa hota he ye kejariwal sarkaar ke ek or chunavi vaade kii purti hoga
 At a press conference on Wednesday, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the government will soon pardon the guest teachers of Delhi
 is babat dilli cabinet ne bill taiyaar kiya he
 Soon this bill will be passed in the Vidhan Sabha
 iske liye agle saptaah 4 oktober ko vishesh satr bulaane kii bhi yojana he
 Who are the guest teachers? The process of placing guest teachers in Delhi started in 2009 when the court implemented Right to Education and after that it became mandatory for the government to recruit teachers in Delhi's government schools
 sarkaar agar permanent teacher rakhti to kareeb ek teacher ko 35 se 40 hajaar rupe dene padate
 But in 2009, these teachers were retained by giving 7 to 12 thousand rupees
 philhal pratidin in guest teachers ko kareeb 700 se 900 rupe die jate he
 But only for that day, as many days as they come to teach, no money is given for the week off
 kitne teachers hankhabaron ke mutabik, dilli main kareeb 15 hajaar guest teachers hai
 From time to time, these people have been demanding to perform themselves
 inkaa kahana he ki kejariwal sarkaar ne chunaav se pehle inase vaada kiya tha ki sabhi guest teachers ko permanent kar denge
 They will also increase the salary of guest teachers
 is saal dilli sarkaar guest teacher kii selary to badha chuki he par permanent karne kaa intjaar he
 There is continuous speculation about the future of the congress-jd (S) coalition government in Karnataka
 in atakalon ke bich rajya ke mukhyamantri ech di kumaraswami kaa bada bayaan aayaa he
 In fact, Kumaraswamy said today that at least till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, no one can touch him
 unhone kaha, ‘yah gathbandhan sarkaar sthirataa se chalegi
 i know that no one can touch me for a year
 main kam se kam ek saal, loksabhaa chunaav hone tak yahaan rahoonga
 Till then nobody can do anything for me
 ’kumaraswamine aage kaha ki unhen jo vakt mila he usamen vah shant nahin rahenge or rajya ke hit main faisle lenge
 The Chief Minister said that he will not waste his time and concentrate on work as it is important that there is all round development of the state
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah karj maaf karne ko lekar patibaddh hai or jald isaki ghoshnaa karenge
 Kumaraswamy said in a tweet on his official Twitter handle, 'dear kisankarj is no illusion on apology
 karj maafee ke liye main puri tarah patibaddh hum
 i want to ensure that maximum farmers get the benefit
 main prakriyaaon par kaam kar rahaa hum or jald isaki ghoshnaa karuunga
 'let us tell you that despite the Congress being the bigger party than JD (S) in the state, questions have been raised about the stability of his government since Kumaraswamy was offered the post of CM
 pehle mantrimandal ko lekar donon partiyon main baat nahin ban rahi thi or ab kuch vidhayak mantri naa banane se pareshaan hai
 Chief Minister Kumaraswamy had also recently accepted the tension
 bihar main bijepi ke saath milakar chunaav lard rahi hindustani avam morcha ke jeethanram maanjhi ne kendriya mantri wike singh ke khilaaf khulkar karrwai kii maang kii he
 This demand has increased the bjp's difficulties amid the election campaign
 maanjhi ne kaha he ki wike singh ne daliton kii tulana kutton se kii he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take strong action against him
 bijepi ke liye khadi kii duvidhamajhine lalu prasad or nitish kumaar ke sur main sur milaate hue kaha he ki wike singh ke khilaaf aisi karrwai honi chahie, taaki dobaaraa koi netaa daliton ke khilaaf is tarah kaa bayaan dene kaa dussahas kabhi na kare
 Manjhi is a big Dalit leader in Bihar
 bijepi ko unke sahare kareeb 10 fisadi mahadalit voton kii ummid he
 In such a situation, there can be a dilemma for the BJP
 yah kaha tha wike singh neballabhagarh kii ghatana par wike singh ne kaha tha ki yah parivaar kaa masalaa tha
 Stop cursing the central government on every issue
 koi kute ko pathar maar de usamen centre sarkaar kya kar sakati he
 His statement was roundly condemned
 haalanki iske baad singh ne safai main maafee maangate hue kaha ki unka makasad daliton kii tulana kutton se karne se nahin tha
 Saddened by the incident in Faridabad, Manjhi has said that he is deeply saddened by the incident in Faridabad, where four people of Jahlit family were burnt alive
 unhone kaha ki kisi jati yaa ghar main janm lenaa insaan ke haath main nahin hota
 If someone is born in a Dalit family, what is his fault? Other allies also gave the bjp's second ally in Nasihatbihar, BJP leaders have been advised to avoid such controversial statements
 rashtriya lok samta party ke upendra kushvaahane kaha ki bijepi netaaon ko is tarah ke bayaan nahin dene chahie
 The Congress has also intensified its demand for action against Union Minister VK Singh
 pravaktaa priyanka chaturvedi ne kaha he ki bijepi wike singh ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar rahi, iskaa matlab he ki unhone jo kuch bhi kaha vah uske samarthan main he
 BJP doesnt take action against VK Singh, that just means that they support what he says: Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congpic

 One might think that it would be very easy for a soldier to define the concept of patriotism and its meaning
 aakhirkaar, ham us samooh ke sabase adhik dikhaai dene vaale pratik hai jo desh ke sammaan ke liye jivan kaa balidaan karne ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahete hue desh ke prati patibaddhta pradarshit karte hai
 However, in today's world, where the terms 'patriotism' and 'nationalism' are often used interchangeably — and have acquired an emotional character — defining patriotism is not straightforward
 isamen vyaktigat purvaagrah bhi dikh saktaa he, or deshbhakti kii meri dharna kisi anya sainik se puri tarah se alag bhi prathit ho sakati he
 One possible way to view this in such a situation may be to view patriotism in an organizational context rather than an individualist perspective
 sena kuch logon kaa asthai samooh nahin he, balki yah ek adwitiya or alag visheshtaon vaala pesha he
 Morris Jonowitz, in his unique book The Professional Soldier, states, '[A] profession is more than a group's specialized skills, which are acquired through intensive training

 But we do not view patriotism symbolically or geographically; We also look at advancing and preserving India's national values
 walter bern apni pustak mekking patriots main deshbhakti ko paribhaashit karte hue kehete hai ki deshbhakti na keval desh ke liye, balki desh ke siddhanton ke prati or un siddhanton ke paalan ke prati katibaddhta ke liye bhi utani hi mahatvapurn he
 To this, i can add to the practice of the principles contained in our Constitution; And this is where the army stands at the forefront

 Walter Byrne defines a patriot as "more than a citizen or resident of a nation; He has to be devoted to his nation and be ready to protect it
 '' sainikon ke rup main, ham bharat kii raksha main apana jivan lagane ko taiyaar hai or is prakaar swat:sfoort rup se deshbhakt hai
 But we do not pretend that; In fact, excessive displays of patriotism or discussion are discouraged
 iskaa ek kaaran yah he ki deshbhakti par ek bahes kai baar rajnatik rang le sakati he, or raajnneeti aamtaur par charchaa ke vishay ke rup main varjit rahi he
 The second reason is more practical

 ''isliye, sena acha netritv dene, afasaron va javaanon ke bich saahas, vafadari, sammaan, akhandta or unit ke gaurav ke mulya viksit karne par jor detii he

 donon pakshon ke tark acchhee tarah se gyaat hai, or aap jis vichaardhaara ke saath hai, uskaa aasaani se bachaav kar sakate hai
 However, what is important is that no one should be forced to follow another's brand of patriotism
