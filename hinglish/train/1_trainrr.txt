 Let me tell you, while besieging Rahul Gandhi about the statement 'why is Modi in the name of all thieves', Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday that the Congress President has tried to tarnish the image of the backward community by making this statement
 Keep it

 Modi had claimed, 'congress and its allies say that all Modi in the society are thieves
 congress or uske sahyogiyon ne meri pichhadi jati ko apshabd kehane main koi kasar nahin chodi
 This time, he has crossed the limits and has abused the entire backward community
 ' piem modi ne gandhi kii aalochana karte hue kaha, ‘namdaar' ne pehle ‘chaukeedaar chor he' kaha tha
 Now they are trying to tarnish the image of a backward community (modi community)
 pichde samudaay se hone ke kaaran main is pidaa kaa aadi ho gaya hum
 He also said, 'congress has been insulting me for many years because of my background of backward community
 ' unhone kaha, ‘main is prakaar ke hamalon kaa aadi ho gaya hum
 Now they are tarnishing the image of the entire community, defaming me
 yadi aap puure samudaay ko apamaanit karne kii koshish karte hai to main yah nahin sahuunga
 Why should i give this title to the entire backward community by calling me a thief '' There is no shortage of babas in India, find one, find thousands
 
 
 baba banane ke liye kisi degree yaa koi course karne kii zarurat nahin hoti, bas ek sandesh janata tak pahunchaana hota he ki falaan bhagwaan kaa yaa kisi mahapurush kaa avatar he
 
 
 So, if there is no shortage of Babas, then how will there be a shortage of their devotees

 They think themselves above the law

 They try to run a parallel government by making the ashram a fort, but like every business, there are some good babas who are spending the money of the public in the service of the people
 
 
 lekin un baabaaon par baaten phir kabhi, aaj charchaa sirf kaali bhedon kii
 
 
 The list of disputed babas is quite long

 Chandraswamy faced a case of money manipulation, in which he also proved to be a criminal

 Nityananda Swamy of Bengaluru is also accused of rape
 
 
 shiv murat dvivedi urf ichhadhari sant par sex racket chalaane kaa aarope laga
 
 
 Now the name of Saint Rampal of Satlok Ashram has also been added to the names of these disputed Babas
 
 
 rampal sant banane se pehle peshey se sarkari vibhaag main junior ejeeniyar the
 
 
 After making Satlok Ashram in Karontha in the year 1999, he declared himself a saint
 
 
 apane aapako kabir kaa avatar kehete hai
 
 
 All was normal for a few years, but then the people of Karauntha and the adjoining villages, especially the Aryasamajis, began to object to Rampal's discourses
 
 
 varsh 2006 main rohtak ke karauntha gaanv ke satalok ashram main golicond hua, jisamen ek vyakti kii maut ho gai
 
 
 Rampal was also accused, and he spent about 22 months in jail

 The court finally found out the method of video conferencing in July this year
 
 
 14 july ko hisar seshan court main video conferencing honi thi, lekin vahaan rampal ke samarthakon ne hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 
 
 Taking cognizance, the Punjab and Haryana High Court issued a notice against Rampal
 
 
 5 november se 21 november tak chaar tareekhen mil chuki hai, lekin rampal adaalat se dur agyaat sthaan main chhipe hue hai
 
 
 He knows that once he is caught in the law, he will have the same condition as the other hypocrites like Asaram
 
 
 bakre kii maa kab tak khayr manaayegi, dersver, kabhi na kabhi to rampal kanoon kii giraft main aaenge
 
 
 It was read in books that a saint is like a 'lotus in mud', different from mud even while in mud
 
 
 sansar main rahete hue bhi sansaarik sukhon se udasin, lekin aajkal ke baabaaon ko dekhakar lagata he ki ve keechad par lotna zyada pasand karte hai
 
 
 Rampal calls himself an incarnation of Saint Kabir, but has himself forgotten the words of Kabir

 Today, Veeru's retirement on his 38th birthday has completed one year
 chaliye is sabase visphotak or khatarnaak ballebaaj kii cricket ke maidan par kuch un uplabdhiyon ko yaad karte hai jo aaj bhi sahvaag ke naam par barkaraar hai
 1
 sahvaag tripal centuri jadne vaale ekmaatr bhartiyasahvaag ne 2004 main yah record pakistan kii dharti par apane chir pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf banaaya
 He scored 309 runs, surpassing the then record VVS Laxman's score of 281 runs
 yah record to cricket ke lagbhag sabhi prashansakon ko pataa he
 But it is rare to remember that during this innings, Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar shared a 336-run partnership for the third wicket which is still the record of India's largest partnership for this wicket
 2
 Virender Sehwag, the first cricketer to score a triple century with a six, struck his first triple century in Multan, Pakistan, in a very interesting way
 unase pehle kisi bhi cricketer ne yah karnama nahin kiya tha
 For the first time, an Indian was going to score a triple century
 is match se thik chaar paariyaan pehle wo australian dharti par apana pehla doharaa shatak banane kii dahalij par the lekin unhone chakka jadne kii koshish kii or 195 ran par out ho gaye
 This must have been in Sehwag's mind in Multan, even though he had no fear of being dismissed
 yah sahvaag hi the or saath tha unka behad majboot aatmavishvaas jisane is ajoobe karname ko chakke ke saath puraa kiya
 The whole of Hindustan was watching him on television making history and is still keeping this astonishing moment in his chest
 sahvaag se pehle kisi cricketer ne chakke se tihara shatak puraa nahin kiya tha jabaki unke baad bhi yah karnama keval ek hi ballebaaj, srilanka ke kumaar sangakaara ne 2014 main kiya
 3
 test main do tihare shatak kaa karnama29 march 2004 ko multan main tihara shatak jadne ke thik chaar saal baad 28 march 2008 ko sahvaag ne ek baar phir yah karnama kar dikhaaya
 This time the South African team had to face the heat of Sehwag
 sahvaag tab sar don breadman or bryan lara ke baad yah karnama karne vaale keval tisare cricketer the
 However, Chris Gayle later joined the list and so far, there are only four cricketers who have managed to achieve this feat twice
 itnaa hi nahin sahvaag iske baad ek baar phir 4 disambar 2009 ko srilanka ke khilaaf tihara shatak jadne kii dahalij par the lekin 293 ran par out ho gaye or keval saat ranon se yah karnama karne se chook gaye
 Significantly, Sir Don Bradman was also not out at 299 once during his career
 4
 Centuries less than 100 and double centuries in less than 200 balls! Sehwag holds the record for scoring the maximum number of Test centuries in less than 100 balls
 sahvaag ne apane test kariyar ke dauraan kul 23 shatak jade hai
 He is followed by Adam Gilchrist who did this feat six times
 kris gail ne chaar baar to ian botham, kapil dev, bryan lara, shahid afridi or brendan maikalam ne teen baar yah karnama kiya
 Not only this, so far only five double centuries have been scored in Test cricket, in which less than 200 balls were played
 inamen se teen 168, 182 or 194 gendon par to akele sahvaag ke naam par hai
 The other two players are Nathan Astle (153 balls) and Brendon mccallum (186 balls)
 sahvaag ne test cricket main chah dohare shatak jade or inamen se paanch to 230 gendon se kam main bane
 This is Sehwag's wonder
 kyon? iskaa pataa isi se chalata he ki kisi anya ballebaaj ke naam test cricket main 250 se kam gendon par do dohare shatak lagane kaa record bhi nahin he
 5
 vanade main doharaa shatak jadne vaale ekmaatr captainvirendra sahvaag ne jab vanade cricket main doharaa shatak jadaa tab yah karnama sachin tendulkar kar chuke the lekin sahvaag ne apni hi captaini main yah karnama kiya or wo aaj bhi vanade cricket main doharaa shatak jadne vaale ekmaatr cricket captain hai
 On 8 December 2011, Sehwag was captaining India against the West Indies at the Holkar Stadium in Indore (india has recently played their 500th Test here)
 toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji ke liye utre sahvaag is din apane alag hi andaaj main the
 He scored 219 runs in just 149 balls with the help of 25 fours and seven sixes
 iske saath hi vanade cricket main sabase badi captaini pari ke sanath jayasoorya ke record ko unhone dhwast kar diya
 Not only this, it was also the highest individual score of ODI for almost three years
 jise bharat ke hi rohit sharma ne srilanka ke khilaaf eden garden main 13 november 2014 ko todaa or 264 ran banaae
 6
 test or vanade cricket kaa anoothaa recordsahvaag ke naam ek aisa nayab record he jise paanaa bade se bade cricketer ke liye aasaan nahin rahaa he
 At one time, the cricketer Virender Sehwag was the biggest individual contributor to the Indian team's biggest innings in all three formats of cricket
 test main bharat kaa sarvaadhik score 729 / 9 (2009 main srilanka ke khilaaf) rahaa he
 Sehwag scored 293 runs in this innings
 vanade main 418 / 5 (2011 main westeindies ke khilaaf) bharat kaa sabase bada score he or is match main sahvaag kaa yogadan 219 ranon kaa tha
 Both these records are still intact
 lekin tii20 main unka record ab dhwast ho chukaa he jo unhone 2007 world tii20 ke dauraan england ke khilaaf durban main banaae the
 India scored 218 / 4 in that match and Sehwag contributed the maximum of 68 runs in it

 The women, who were struggling to climb the Shani platform in Shinganapur, got court support today
 ek arji kii sunwaayee par bombai hoicourt ne do din ke andar rajya sarkaar se likhit jawaab maanga he or poocha he ki shani mandir ke chabutare par agar purush ja sakate hai to mahilaayein kyon nahin? According to social activist Vidya Bal, the state right of entry into Hindu religious places has been in existence since 1956
 iske baad bhi shri shri ravishankar, shankaracharya or mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis charchaa ke naam par vakt jaaya kar rahe hai
 So they were forced to appeal to the court
 shinganapur main shani mandir chabutare par mahilaon ke jane par pabandi he
 In November last year, a woman showed courage to climb the platform and break the tradition that had been going on for years
 uske baad ranraagini brigade kii mahilaon ne bhi mandir main pravesh karne kii naakaam koshish kii thi
 The comments ab adaalat ke is sawaal par ensipi kii vidya chavaan ne kushi jaahir karte hue kaha he ki isse mahilaon ko bal mila he
 While Neelam Gorhe of Shiv Sena says that it is the responsibility of the government to give women their rights and they should fulfill their responsibility
 shani shinganapur ke baad rajya ke duusare mandiron or dargah main bhi is tarah ke bhedbhaav ke khilaaf aawaaj uthni shuru ho gai he
 Now everyone's eyes are on the state government's response
 saamaajik kaaryakarta vidya bal ke mutabik rajya hindu dharmik sthalon main pravesh ke adhikaar kaa kanoon 1956 se astitv main he
 Even after this, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Shankaracharya and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis are spending time in the name of discussion
 isliye majaboor hokar unhen adaalat se guhaar lagaani padi
 The Shani temple platform at Shinganapur prohibits women from leaving
 pichley saal november main ek mahila ne chabutare par chadhakar saalon se chali aa rahi us parampara ko todane kaa saahas dikhaaya
 After that the women of Ranragini brigade also tried unsuccessfully to enter the temple
 tippaniyan Now on this question of the court, ncp's Vidya Chavan has expressed happiness that it has given strength to women
 jabaki shivasena kii neelam gorhe kaa kahana he mahilaon ko unka adhikaar dilaane kii jimmedaari sarkaar kii he or use apni jimmedaari nibhaani chahie
 After Shani Shingnapur, voices have started to be raised against such discrimination in other temples and dargahs in the state
 ab sab kii nigahen rajya sarkaar ke jawaab par lagi he

 In the era of Lok Sabha elections, there is a competition among writers who support Prime Minister Narendra Modi to praise him
 un par likhi kitabon kii baadh si aa gai he
 Some people are writing on his personality, others are writing on his gratitude, some are writing biographies and some are saving his lectures
 par maakhanlaal chaturvedi rashtriya patrakarita evam sanchaar vishvavidhyalay ke sahaayak praadhyaapak dow
 Saurabh Malaviya's book 'india on the Path of Development' is a little different from this
 haalanki kitaab ke cover par sansad bhawan ke saath pradhanmantri modi kii khilakhilaati tasviir dekh yah lagata he ki yah kitaab bhi unka prachaar karne vaali hi he, par iske adhyay va prishth palatney ke baad yah manyata badalati si lagati he, or yah spasht sa ho jaataa he ki yah kitaab sarkari yojanaon ke suchanaatmak, vyaakhyaatmak vivaran or tathyon par aadhaarit he na ki tarif par
 Saurabh Malaviya has taken the initiative to explain the 36 major schemes of the Central and State Governments through this book after extensive study
 is kitaab kii prastaavna main saurabh malviya ne likhaa bhi he ki 'desh ke logon ke saamaajik, aarthik or shaikshik vikaas ke liye sarkaar anek yojanaayen chalaa rahi hai
 The objective of every scheme is that its benefits reach every person
 jab yojana kaa laabh vyakti tak pahunchataa he, vah yojana safal hoti he
 At present, about one hundred and fifty schemes are running in the country
 inamen adhiktar puraani yojanaayen hai
 Among them are many such old schemes, whose names have been changed
 inamen kai aisi yojanaayen bhi hai, jo lagbhag band ho chuki thim or unhen dobaaraa shuru kiya gaya he
 These include some new schemes
 desh main do prakaar kii sarkari yojanaayen chal rahi hai
 The first schemes are those which are run by the central government
 is tarah kii yojanaayen puure desh yaa desh ke kuch vishesh rajyon main chalaai jaati hai
 Other schemes are those run by the state governments
 is pustak ke madhyam se sarkari kii kuch mahatvapurn yojanaon par prakaash daalate hue unhen pathakon tak pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 It often happens that due to ignorance and illiteracy, people are not aware of the government-friendly schemes, due to which they are deprived of availing these schemes
 is pustak kaa uddeshy yahi he ki log un sabhi yojanaon kaa laabh uthaaen, jo sarkaar unke kalyaan ke liye chalaa rahi he
 
 in yojanaon kii jaankaree sambandhit mantralayon se praapt jaankaree par aadhaarit he
 It is worth mentioning that from time to time there is also a partial change in plans
 prakaashak yash publications ne bhi apni baat kahi he
 The publisher has written that the central government and state governments of the country are running many schemes for the welfare of the people
 in yojanaon kaa mukhya uddeshy janata ke jivan str main sudhaar laana tathaa sabhi kshetron kaa samaan vikaas sunishchit bananaa he
 Various welfare schemes are formulated by the government to suit the condition of the target groups, so that the target class can benefit from them
 sarkaar mahila shashaktikaran par vishesh dhyaan de rahi he or iske liye vibhinn yojanaayen chalaai ja rahi hai
 The government is running ambitious schemes like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, Digital India and Swachh Bharat Mission
 yah pustak centre or rajya sarkaron kii aisi hi kuch yojanaon par prakaash daalati he
 Through this book, an attempt has been made to make public information about the public welfare schemes of the government
 nishchit rup se yah pustak apane uddeshy main safalataa praapt karegi
 In the role of the book, senior journalist Shishir Sinha has written that the common man always finds the answer to a question in the figures of development
 sawaal ye he ki in aankadon kaa 'mere' liye kya matlab he? sawaal tab or bhi ahm ban jaataa he ki ek hi din akhbaar kii do surkhiyaan alag-alag kahani kahati hai
 The first headline is, 'india becomes the fastest developing country in the world' or 'india will remain the fastest growing country for the next two years,' while the second headline is' billionaire wealth increased by an average of Rs 2200 crore daily
 , 10 percent of the population living in extreme poverty has been in debt for 14 consecutive years
 ' aise main ye sawaal or bhi ahm ban jaataa he ki 7
 3, 7
 5 yaa 7
 The annual growth rate of 7 per cent is limited to a very small part of the population, or whether the person of last rank in the society is also able to get the benefit or not? It would be necessary to know the answer of similar questions
 Is that what the government finally did to bring development from the headlines to the people, or what was different from what it did before? 
 
 
 This book tries to find the answer to this question
 
 
 apni bhoomika main unhone aage likhaa he ki sach to yahi he ki kisi bhi sarkari yojana kii sarthakata is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kitni jaldi wo sarkari soch se aam aadmi kii soch main apni jagah bana paati he
 It is also important that government schemes should not only be considered as a medium to distribute money, but it is also necessary to see how they can contribute to the betterment of the individual, society, state and country
 ye bhi behatar hoga ki muft main kuch bhi baantne kaa silsilaa band hona chahie
 Whether all such things have been seen in the schemes launched during the last four and a half years, the answer will be yes to a large extent
 ek or baat
 There is competition among states to start schemes with new experiments and the happy conclusion is that no matter what political party government started, its utility was recognized by the governments of other political parties
 telugana kii raitu bandhu yojana or oreisha kii kaaliya yojana ko hi le lijie
 The Central Government is studying these schemes to change the lives of farmers, so that some special features of these schemes can be included in the national level scheme
 vibhinn sarkari yojanaon ko shuru karne kaa lakshya yahi he ki vikaas kaa phayda har kisi ko mili yani vikaas samaveshi ho
 The 36 schemes mentioned here should be estimated based on some similar parameters
 phir ye sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he ki kya ye yojanaayen kaamyaab hai? agar sarkaar kahe kaamyaab to asamanta ko lekar jari nai report ko saamne rakh charchaa karne se nahin hichakana chahie
 One thing is certain, no matter how much religion, caste and creed do politics on the basis of this, but before pressing the button on the EVM, the voter once thinks about what such a candidate has done for development, or whether he can do further development
 Will be able to do something concrete about mat bhuuliye sarkari yojanaayen aapke hi paise se chalati hai or in yojanaon kii sarthakata par apana paksh rakhane ke liye har paanch saal main aapako ek mauka to miltaa hi he
 To develop such thinking, it is necessary to present before you the details of government schemes in a simple and easy manner

 The sensation spread after the girl was found at Keelashbori on the roof of a religious place in Muradnagar, Ghaziabad
 shav ke postmortem report se khulaasa hua ki uske saath berahami se rape kiya gaya tha or uskaa ek haath bhi tod diya gaya
 Also the girl was raped unnaturally
 maamle main parivaar ne sthaniyasabhasadapar aarope lagaaya tha
 But the story turned out to be something else
 pulicene ilaake ke do yuvakon ko bacchee kihatyaor dushkarm ke maamle main giraftaar kar ghatana kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Both the accused have been sent to jail
 muradanagar main 6 saal kii maasoom bacchee kii laash ek dharmik sthal kii chat par mili thi

 Out of these, a person named Mujib is well educated and studying in b Pharma is also doing a job in Himachal
 kuch samay ke liye vah muradanagar main apane ghar aayaa hua tha or usee dauraan bacchee par uski niyat bighad gai
 On the night of October 4, both of them made a plan and invited the girl to their house in some way
 bacchee paas kii dukaan par toffee lene gai thi or lautate samay saath khilne kaa jhansa de aaropee mujeeb use apane kamare main le gaya or cameraa band kar uske saath ghinauni harakat kii
 The girl was killed during rape and rape
 aropiyon ne uski laash ko bori main daalkar ghar main hi bed main chupa diya gaya
 During this both of them kept coming in and out of the house so that no one could doubt them
 laash ko thikaane lagane ke liye raat kaa vakt chunaa gaya or der raat kareeb 4-5 baje ke paas ke dharmik sthal kii chat par mauka paakar laash ko thikaane laga diya gaya
 So that the police and people can be misled
 donon ko yah pataa tha ki pehla shaq ilaake ke sabhasad par gaya kyonki bacchee ke parivaar kiranjishsabhasad se chal rahi he or hua bhi vahi, lekin forensik team ne aasapaas ke sabhi gharon kii talaashi lee or vahaan se saboot uthaae jiske baad ghar se mili khun ke nishaan ke baad mamaa bhaanje mujeeb or shibu police ke shikanje main aa gaye

 The child was killed with great cruelty
 police ke mutabik mujeeb ke ghar waalon main se ek mahila ne ghatana kii raat ko donon ko bori le jate hue dekh liya tha
 But did not tell the police
 police kaa kahana he ki hatya kii baat pataa chalane par bhi police ko nahin bataane ke gunahagaar hatyaron ke parivaar par bhi karrwai kii jaaegi
 The family of the deceased had also lodged an FIR against the sashad and his family, but after police investigation, the sarsad is currently given a clean chit and the murderers' uncles and nephews have been arrested and sent to jail

 ) haryana main kingmekar banakar ubhare dushyant chautalamaharashtra kaa king banane kii res main aditya thakredushyant parivaar se alag chale, aditya ne todi paramparaado rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ne do nae netaaon ko janm diya he
 One has started his innings to pursue the legacy of politics, the other has rebelled from the family and has prepared his own political path
 siyasat ke ye do shahjade aditya thakare or dushyant chautaala hai
 While Dushyant Chautala has played the role of Kingmaker in Haryana, Aditya Thackeray is looking to make Shiv Sena the King of Maharashtra
 maharashtra or haryana main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey guuruuvaar ko ghoshit kiye gaye hai
 No party has got a majority in Haryana
 sabase bade dale ke rup main ubhari bhartiya janata party ko 40 siten mili hai or congress 31 par simat gai he
 That is, neither of these two major parties have been able to get seats on their own to form the government
 aisi sthiti main 10 siten jeetne vaali jananaayak janata party (jejepi) kii bhoomika sabase ahm ho gai he or uske netaa dushyant chautaala kingmekar banane kii bhoomika main aa gaye hai
 Stung majority in Haryana: Where the weakened Khattar, this factor made its way by revolting from the family; Chaudhary Devi Lal's political legacy sparked a war between the sons of former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, while the younger son of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) commanded Abhay Chautala Got in hand
 disambar 2018 main chautaala parivaar main panape manmutav ke baad dushyant alag ho gaye or apni alag party jananaayak janata party kaa gathan kar liya
 On the strength of the new fledgling party, Dushyant traveled all over Haryana and fielded his party's candidates in all 90 seats of the state
 dushyant ko janata kaa samarthan mila or jejepi 10 siten jeet gayi
 On the other hand, the INLD won only one seat
 yani parivaar kii siyaasi viraasat na milane ke baad baghawat kar dushyant ne apana alag siyaasi safar tay kar liya he
 Aditya Thackeray in the race to become King? On one hand, Dushyant Chautala is another popular face in this election
 dushyant parivaar se baghawat kar alag raah par nikle hai to aditya ne chunaav ladakar thakare parivaar kii parampara ko hi badal diya he
 In the 53-year history of the Shiv Sena, neither the party's founder Bala Saheb Thackeray ever contested the election and his heir Uddhav Thackeray
 lekin paariwarik raajnneeti sanbhaalane kaa mauka jab aditya ke paas aayaa to unhone ateet ko bhula diya or chunaav maidan main utar gaye
 Aditya has also won the election from Worli seat and now the discussion is on whether he will become Chief Minister or Deputy Chief Minister
 power nahin, pavaar kaa karishma: bijepi ko baikaphire kar gaya NCP chif par hamalavar rukhshivsena ne tareri akhenmaharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke liye jis tarah ke nattejey aae hai, uske baad se hi uddhav thakare or unki party ke tevar alag najar aa rahe hai
 The Shiv Sena is vigorously pursuing the fact that in the event of formation of the government, it will be necessary to implement the predefined 50-50 formula, under which equal participation in the government was agreed
 is aadhaar par shivasena kii najar mukhyamantri kii kursi par bhi bataai ja rahi he
 Uddhav Thackeray himself said after the election results that this was an important issue to be discussed
 saath hi wo nateezon se pehle kehete rahe hai ki ek din shivasena kaa siem jarur hoga, ye vaada unhone bala sahib thakare se kiya tha
 In such a situation, Shiv Sena will definitely want to capitalize on this opportunity and if such equations are formed then Aditya Thackeray can definitely be seen in a big role
 is tarah maharashtra or haryana ke vidhansabha chunaav ne in donon rajyon main do nae or yuva netaa de die hai, jinka bhavishya maujuuda paristhitayon main ujjwal najar aa rahaa he
 Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said that the current Australian team is the weakest team to have ever visited India
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘unke paas spinneron ko khel paane vaale ballebaaj nahin hai, yahaan wicket chatakaane vaale spinner nahin hai
 i don't want to assess the team, but looking at Australia after 1996, i feel that it is the weakest team to play on Indian soil
 ’australia ke khilaaf bharat kii jeet kii hetric par pratikriya karte hue ganguli ne kaha ki bharat ko is siries main 4-0 se whitewash karne ke liye kotla main chaar din or spin mufeed pich chahie
 Ganguly did not like the decision of the Australian team management to suspend four players due to indiscipline
 unhone kaha, ‘aap kitne hi anushaasit hon lekin safal hone ke liye kaushal kii jarurat hoti he
 The Australian team lacks skills on this tour
 ’ In Uttar Pradesh, the alliance plan of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has been finalized
 kal yani shanivaar ko 12 baje sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or basapa supremeo mayawati press conference main iskaa aupchaarik elaan kar sakate hai
 This means that the alliance between the two parties is firm and the Congress is not involved in this
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main ab ek taraf jahaan bijepi hogi to duusari taraf akhilesh yadav or mayawati kii jodi hogi
 The Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, which once had a figure of thirty-six, have agreed to forget the old rivalries
 donon ne congress ko is safar main saathi hone ke laayak nahin samajha
 There may be strategic coordination behind the scenes from Congress
 uski shakl kya hogi ye dekhne vaali baat hogi
 In such a situation, we tell you how SP-BSP has given a big shock to the Congress
 koun se wo kaaran hai jisase donon partiyaan saath ai hai
 Getting less seats in the 1-2017 assembly elections, both the SP-BSP suffered a major defeat in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 is chunaav main sapa ko jahaan 47 siten mili thim to basapa ko 19 siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa tha
 BJP got 312 seats in this election
 aise main 2019 main modi kaa saamana karne ke liye donon partia ko saath aana padaa
 Being defeated in front of BJP in the Lok Sabha elections of 2-2014, both parties lost big in the Modi wave in 2014
 80 siton vaale uttar pradesh main basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mili thi or sapa to sirf apane kunbe tak hi rah gai thi
 Since 2014, the way the graph of both the parties dropped, both of them needed a big support
 aise main donon partiyaan 26 saal kii dushmani bhulakar saath ain or 2019 main modi kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar huin
 The 3-by-election formula was a hit with both parties
 phulpur or gorakhpur upachunaav main donon ke saath aane kaa formula hit hua tha
 The two fought and won together in Gorakhpur, considered the safest BJP seat
 4-congress kii kamjor haalat ke chalate choda saath
 The condition of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh continued to weaken
 congress ko jahaan rajya main ek phir baar khadaa hone ke liye sahare kii jarurat thi aise main donon ne gathbandhan main usko jagah nahin di
 The SP fought alongside the Congress in the assembly elections and the alliance proved to be a flop
 is chunaav main sapa 47 or congress 7 siten hi jeetne main safal rahi
 5 - In the absence of an alliance, the future of both is in danger
 agar sapa or basapa kaa gathbandhan nahin hota to is baar bhi loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii raah aasaan ho jaati
 With the bjp's victory, the future of both parties would also be in danger
 pehle vidhansabha chunaav main karaari haar or lagaataar do loksabhaa chunaav main haar se upi kii in donon pramukh partiyaan kaa bhavishya khatre main hota
 6 - Maximum of 80 seats in the Lok Sabha are concerned
 loksabhaa kii sabase zyada siten uttar pradesh main hai
 Every party concentrates on winning maximum seats here
 desh ko sabase zyada pradhanmantri bhi isi rajya ne die hai
 In the 2014 elections, the BJP won 71 seats in a historic performance in this state
 sapa or basapa kaa asar sabase zyada isi rajya main he
 In such a situation, both the parties are expected to win maximum seats in the 2019 elections
 2017 upi vidhansabha chunaav congress or samaajawaadee party milakar lade the
 In this election, BJP got 312 seats, SP got 47 seats, BSP got 19 seats and Congress got 7 seats
 beete kuch dinon main rafel ko lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi jis tarah se modi sarkaar par hamalavar dikhe hai or unki lokapriyata main pehle ke mukaable jis tarah se ijapha dekhne ko mila he usase kahin naa kahin congress kaa vishwaas jarur badha he
 The Congress is hopeful that the party will do well this time in UP
 rahul gandhi khud kah chuke hai ki congress upi main acha kar sakati he
 He said that the idea of congress is very strong in UP
 isliye hamen upi main apni kshamta par puraa bharosa he or ham logon ko chakit kar denge
 The Congress is definitely away from the alliance, but it will not ease the bjp's headache
 congress ke paas aaj bhi upi main 6 se 8 fisadi vot he
 By giving tickets at the wholesale price to the upper castes, the Congress will dent the bjp's vote bank

 tanushri datta ne 10 saal pehle ai film 'horn oke plis' kii shooting ke daurannaanaa patekarpar chhedchhad karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 With this, the issue of Metoo in Bollywood once again heats up
 tanushri ne kaha he ki ek item song ke dauraan naanaa intimet hona chaahate the, lekin ve iske liye taiyaar nahin thim
 She got angry and left in her vanity van
 tanushri ne jis film (life oke plis) ke dauraan apane saath hui chhedhkhani kii baat kii he, uski assistant diarector shayani shetty ne indian express se baatcheet main bataaya he ki aakhir set par unhone kya dekha
 Shayani is the second eye witness
 jarnlist jainis sikeria isse pehle is maamle kii ankhon dekhi gavaah hone kaa daawa kar chuki hai
 metoo in Bollywood: Koun Diya Golmol Jawabashyani, with Kaun Tanushree, said, “tanushree was getting uncomfortable working with Nana during rehearsals in the shooting of the film
 ye ek item song tha, jise ham filmistan studio main shoot kar rahe the
 There was little work left
 shuru ke do din hamane shoot nahin kiya, kyonki ham reharsal kar rahe the
 By the way, Eddie's work is not much when the song is shot, because the choreographer watches everything, we were on set and watching rehearsals
 ek samay par ham saaf taur par ye dekh sakate the ki tanushri ek khaas step par asahaj thim yaa uski jis tarah reharsal kii ja rahi thi, usase unhen dikkat thi
 When all this happened, i was sitting a short distance away, so could not tell what the talks were actually about
 lekin yah kah sakati hum ki tanushri vaaki asahaj thim
 She then left in a vanity van
 set par ye bakawaas shuru ho gai ki heroin co-operate nahin kar rahi
 During this time the chaos spread, people moving in and out of the vanity van
 main is baat ko lekar pukhta nahin hum ki naanaa tanushri kii venity vine main gaye the yaa nahin
 But there was talk on the set and it was being murmured that nothing happened
 kuch nahin ho rahaa he
 She is not co-operating
 iske baad tanushri baahar ain or set ke peeche gai
 We thought the shooting would start back
 bollywood main # metoo : naanaa ke baad vivek par tanushri ke aarope, kaha tha- 'utaaro kapade'iske baad ve set par chillane lageen or unhone khud ko venity vine main band kar liya
 This conversation started on the set that something was going wrong
 mere diarector rakesh saarang or baaki log marathi main baat kar rahe the
 They were trying to pacify him
 ham samaj gaye the ki tanushri gusse main hai
 Tanushree then got into her car, where a group of people started vandalizing her car
 kisi tarah tanushri ne apana bachaav kiya
 After all, Rakhi Sawant was replaced by Tanushree for the song
 set par maujuud patrkaar ne kya kaha?film kii shooting ke dauraan patrkaar jainis sikeria bhi maujuud thim
 He too has shared the entire story of that day
 unhone kai twits main kahani bataaya he
 He wrote, "many times the events of a decade ago are still fresh in your mind
 filmahorn oke plizki shooting ke dauraan hui ek ghatana bhi kuch aisi hi he
 "janice wrote," i was there at the time, Nana Patekar
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki actress kii vajah se shooting roki gai he
 Tanushree became difficult to handle
 main safataur par dekh paa rahi thi ki tanushri kisi baat se bahut apaset thim
 "tanushree-nana controversy: Bollywood silent, journalist claims- the actress is telling the truth, Manjis was on the set, she wrote that she was able to clearly see that Nana Patekar, choreographer Ganesh Acharya and a man (who she later knew It was said that the producer of the film) was discussing something about standing there and about 50 dancers were waiting on the set
 aadhikarik jaankaree yah thi ki heroin sahyog nahin kar rahi he
 After some time shooting started
 jainis ne apane twit main likhaa - "tanushri ne apana kaam phir shuru kar diya or kuch shots ke baad naanaa ne phir se unhen join kar liya
 But Tanushree left the set as soon as Nana arrived
 shooting phir se roak di gai
 He locked himself in a vanity van
 vah baahar aane se inkaar kar rahi thim
 In view of it, a few mustaches were gathered there and they started pushing the door
 "tanushri ke maa-baap par hua hamalaa?jaankaree lene par pataa chalaa ki in logon ko produsar ne hi bulaayaa tha
 Meanwhile the police came
 in sabake bich jainis ko naanaa se baat karne kaa mauka mil gaya or naanaa ne sirf itnaa kaha, "meri beti jaisi he
 "there was no meaning on that occasion
 jainis ne bataaya ki isi bich tanushri ke mata-pita vahaan aae or unki car par hamalaa kar diya gaya
 The car's wind shield was broken
 ro padi thim tanushri datta?baad main kisi tarah jab jainis ko tanushri se milane kaa mauka mila to unhone rote-rote puri dastaan unhen sunai
 According to Janis, Tanushree told him that after 3 days of practice, choreographer Ganesh Acharya had changed every step of the dance shoot
 yah sab isliye kiya gaya kyonki produsar chaahate the datta ke saath naanaa dance karen
 What is the whole matter? Tanushree has accused Nana Patekar of profanity and molestation during the shooting
 unhone 2008 main ek film kii shooting ke dauraan naanaa par apane saath jor jabardastee kii koshish kaa aarope lagaaya
 He had said, "nana Patekar wanted to forcibly get closer, he was not a part of the song during the shooting, though he tried to get intimate with him
" bal mundwanaa chaahati thim tanushri, phir pakad liya aadhyatm kaa raastagane ke koreagrapher ganesh acharya, diarector rakesh saarang or produsar sami siddiki sab is baat se waakif hai, lekin kisi ne kuch nahin kiya
 Tanushree said that Nana used to beat heroines
 industry main har kisi ko maaloom he ki heroinon ko lekar wo hameshaa se hi aise rahe hai
 In this case, Ganesh Acharya's reaction has come to light
 ganesh ne naanaa ko clinit di he
 After which Tanushree called Ganesh a liar and a mongrel
 tanushri ke aaropon par kya bole naanaa?apane upar lage sangeen aaropon par naanaa patekar kaa bhi riection saamne aa gaya he
 He denied the allegations and said, "what do they mean by sexual harassment? There were 50 to 100 people with me on the set
" main dekhtaa hum ki kanoonee rup se main kya kar saktaa hum

 February 1, 2018 was a special date for India
 isliye nahin ki us din bajet aayaa
 He comes every year
 yah bharat main vishaal antarraji kaarobaar ko ek sutara main pirone kaa din tha
 On this date, the movement of business goods from Dwarka to Dimapur and Leh to Kovalam was going to be free from all kinds of barriers
 jiesti i ve bill?sahi pakade hai
 This was the most urgent and far-reaching part of GST
 yah van nesan, van system kii shuruyaat tha
 Just a bill emitted from the computer and an exemption to carry goods anywhere, no permit, nor check post! This was the reason that the businessmen were not interested in the speech of the Finance Minister but in the e-bill on the day of the budget
 1 farvari ko bajet bhaashan or jiesti network se i ve bill lene kii jaddojahad ek saath shuru hui
 By the time the budget speech was over, the GST network had sat down
 kuch rajyon ne is par amal radd karne kaa elaan kar diya
 By the evening when the budget was buzzing in the TV studios, the GST officers came out of the house by tweeting that the implementation of the e-bill is being deferred indefinitely due to technical difficulties
 or is tarah desh ko ek bazaar banane yani jiesti kaa sabase bada makasad bhi khet rahaa
 As the seven months of inception passed, the GST reform has turned into a challenge
 -is bajet main tex kii jo maar (capital gens, seemaa shulk main badhotaree, ses va sarcharge) hui vah jiesti kaa nateeja he
 The network's failure to return and tax collection was bad
 is bich gujarat chunaav kii chapet main jiesti kaa dhaancha phent diya gaya
 95 per cent taxpayers got concession by filing returns
 natijatan pichley saat maah main jiesti se rajasav badaae kii ummiden dhah gayi
 -the states suffered more
 pichhali july se march tak ke liye kendriya bajet se rajyon ko 60,000 karod ru
 90,000 crore next year
 die jaaenge
 Revenue reduction and compensation compensated the Finance Minister's deficit control record
 -sabhi kaarobaariyon ko karadaata banane kaa makasad patari se utar gaya he
 Due to the GSTN drawback, the quarterly return facility to 95 per cent taxpayers and the composition scheme comprising one per cent tax and quarterly returns, only 30 per cent taxpayers are filing comprehensive invoice returns
 jiesti kii gafalat se kaaphi bada kaarobaar tex nigahabaani se baahar he
 The initial figures of registration in GST are encouraging for the government
 karadaataaon kii sankhya 50 fisadi badi he
 In small industries, one-third of transactions take place between business units
 isse kar niyam paalan karana aasaan he
 Every state has got registrations according to its industrial business scenario
 isse kisi khaas rajya ko nuksaan yaa phaayde kii ashanka khatm hui he
 However, the hope of increasing revenue through these useful information is less because the implementation of GST has derailed
 i ve bill ke jariye desh bhar main maal kii awajahi kii monitering honi thi jo tex chori rokane ke liye jaruri he
 NIC (government Computer Agency) was put in place to create a system of issuing seven to eight lakh bills per day, but this attempt was also unsuccessful
 -bajet ke baad apane saakshatkaaron main vitt mantri ne kaha ki tex niyamon ke paalan main sakhti ke saath jiesti kaa rajasav badhegaa
 The Finance Ministry says that the monitoring has been increased to Rs one lakh crore
 tex vasula ja saktaa he
 The government is aware that the quota of concessions has been met in this reform
 chunavi dar ke chalate di gai suvidhaon or takneekee khaamiyon ke kaaran tex chori ho rahi he
 The next improvement in GST (including petro-products, real estate) has stalled where revenue has declined
 -jiesti ko lekar sarkaar kii rajnatik duvidha zyada badi he
 To bring it back on track, the return of Inspector Raj, that is, small businessmen will have to be strict
 gujarat kii jali sarkaar chunaavon ke saal yah jokhim to lene se rahi
 Therefore, direct and easy-to-raise taxes (income tax, cess and customs duty) have been increased, consumers are paying taxes, whether business tax will be paid or not, will be accounted for by election
 jiskaa dar tha vahi hua he
 In just seven months, India's latest reform has become like the old radio, which is being run in some way
 jiesti kaa sudhaarwad hamaari yaadon main hameshaa surakshit rahegaa

 After almost a year of unforeseen events, things are seen coming back on track for the second time in Jammu and Kashmir
 majahabi, siyaasi or vaicharik vibhaajak rekhaon main bante is sankatagrast sarahadi praant kii janata ek baar phir apni kismat par samuhik daanv aajamaane ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar rahi he
 Mufti Mohammed Saeed succeeded in making impossible alliances with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 12 months ago, which some described as 'unnatural', some called 'an unstable alliance of two conflicting poles'
 And some named it the 'mel of North and South'
 aaj 56 saal kii unki beti or piples democratic party (pidipi) kii tejatarraar mukhiya mahabuuba mufti jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri ke bataur kaman apane haath main lene ja rahi hai
 This will be the first time in the long troubled history of the state that a woman will become the Chief Minister
 jaahir he, yah uplabdhi unke liye ek badi vyaktigat traasadee ke baad ai he
 His father died on 7 January last
 ab unke saamne chunautiyon kii lambii fehrist he
 Mehbooba will have to work a dangerous balance by sitting at the Fairview Cottage in Srinagar in summer and the grand Chief Minister's residence on Jammu's Wazarat Road in winter
 yah santulan srinagar or dilli ke bich, khubasurat kashmir ghati or jammu ke bich, or 'naram algaavvaad' kii khuraaq par lambey samay se palati rahi apni muslim bahul party pidipi or hindu rashtravaadi bijepi ke bich kaayam karnaa he jo ghati main dhire-dhire rasta bana rahi he
 Is Mehbooba ready for this? After Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's death, he kept himself away from political events in mourning for a long time and (according to many) deliberately delayed and showed no hurry to become Chief Minister for 11 weeks
 unhone bijepi netritv kii ore se gathjod ke ek samaybaddh agenda par aashwast hone kii koshish kii
 The agenda is a 16-page document adopted by both parties on March 1, 2015, when it was decided to form a joint government for the first time between them
 mahabuuba ko bakhubi pataa he ki unke pita kii aguai main shuruaati aath maheenon ke dauraan jamini str par agenda ko utaarne kii disha main takreeban koi kaam nahin ho sakaa he
 The major reason for this was that Narendra Modi's government was hesitating to support the Mufti in decisive areas, including providing relief to thousands of flood victims of 2014
 phir, lagaataar kuch aise vivaad bhi khadey hote rahe jinase bachaa ja saktaa tha
 For example, differences on release of a separatist from prison, ban on beef and use of state flag proposed in Jammu and Kashmir constitution
 pidipi ke andruni log bataate hai ki lagaataar 11 hafte tak jab mahabuuba ne apni chuppi ke kaaran apni party ke netaaon ko bhi gahare bhram main daalaa hua tha, ve darasal ''bijepi ke saath gathbandhan ko jari rakhane ke vivek par bhi vichaar kar rahi thim
 The future direction was discovered when she returned to Srinagar on March 19, instead of waiting for a meeting with the Prime Minister after a meeting with BJP President Amit Shah and General Secretary Ram Madhav in Delhi to resolve all differences
 iske do din baad aisa laga ki kisi jaadu se sab kuch thik ho gaya
 After the meeting with the Prime Minister on March 21 in Delhi, a smile was seen on his face for a long time
 unhone is mulaakaat ko 'bahut sakaaratmak' bataaya or kaha ki ve 'santusht' hai
 Many commentators in the Valley saw it as 'surrender', but their close leaders believe that "now Mehbooba has received personal assurances from the Prime Minister in terms of support for the government in every way
" ''vaise bijepi par bharose kii bahaali ko lekar mahabuuba ne jin maangon ko pehle rakhaa tha, un par pradhanmantri kii ore se koi bayaan nahin aayaa he
 These included the withdrawal of state power projects, removal of the Howard Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA) and providing flood relief
 vahiin sarkaar banane se pehle pidipi or bijepi main matbhed saamne aane lage hai
 The BJP is now denying the pdp's claim of unconditional support and the party's chief spokesperson Sunil Sethi says, "as many cabinet ministers belong to the PDP, so should ours
" ''lekin dobaaraa apane pad par behaal hone kii ummid kar rahe mufti kii cabinet main vitt mantri haseeb drabu kehete hai, ''mahabuuba mufti ne hameshaa yahi kaha tha ki ve tabhi koi faisla karengi jab ve nijee taur par santusht ho jaaengi (ki yah gathbandhan un uddeshyon kii purti kar saktaa he jinhen lekar chalaa gaya tha)
 He worked in this direction for this purpose

 TTD warned that legal action will be taken against whoever spreads fake news against the temple and hurts the sentiments of crores of Hindus
 isse pehle artisi bason ke tikat par jerusalem or makka ke paryaton vigyaapan par vivaad paidaa ho gaya tha
 The BJP had alleged that Jaganmohan Reddy's party was spreading the Christian propaganda
 iske alaava bijepi ne mandir ke khajaane main sone or chaandi ke aabhushanon ke gaayab hone kaa bhi aarope lagaaya tha
 Recently, a picture of the alleged church at the site of the temple also went viral on social media

 2000 ke note band hone ke gurumurti ke bayaan par congress ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha he ki gurumurti ne jo bayaan diya he usase yah sawaal uthta he ki aakhir sarkaar koun chalaa rahaa he
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad says that Gurumurthy has spoken about the 2000 note being closed, so the question arises whether Gurumurthy is running the government
 sarkaar gurumurti chalaa rahe hai yaa pradhanmantri chalaa rahe hai yaa vittamantri chalaa rahe hai yaa rigerv bank of india chalaa rahi he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that when the first demonetization was decided, it was announced by the Prime Minister even though it should have been announced by the Reserve Bank of India or by the Finance Minister
 naidu kaa palatvarudhar sarkaar kii taraf se soochna or prasaaran mantri venkaiya naidu kaa kahana he ki gurumurti ne sirf suzav diya he kisi ko bhi suzav dene kaa adhikaar he, gurumurti ek rashtravaadi he
 On the statement of Ghulam Nabi Azad, Venkaiah Naidu says that during his time the government used to run Sonia Gandhi, so he is doing such things
 is vakt hamaari sarkaar main pradhanmantri narendra modi hi faisla lete hai agar congress ko koi suzav dena he to vah sansad main aakar den
 Venkaiah Naidu says that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided that the people are with him, this will end black money corruption
 is samay hamaari praathamikta nai karency zyada se zyada uplabdh karana he taaki logon ko jo pareshaani aa rahi he vah khatm ho jaae
 After that we are moving towards digital by cashless
 vainkaya naidu kaa kahana he ki jo bhi paisa aa rahaa he vah garibon ke janakalyaan ke liye istemaal hoga
 After Priyanka Gandhi was made the General Secretary, Sambit Patra told the media that after all the states have been rejected by the Grand Alliance, the Congress has finally played a bet on Priyanka Gandhi
 priyanka congress ke liye baisakhi kii tarah he
 In New India, this question is being asked that after Nehru ji, Indira ji then Rajiv again, Sonia ji then Rahul ji and now Priyanka ji
 bijepi main party hi parivaar he to congress main parivaar hi party he
 This is the difference between us
 sambit paatra ne yah bhi kaha ki congress party ko sirf ek parivaar ke sabhi log milakar chalaate hai
 Let me tell you that Priyanka Gandhi was made the general secretary of the Congress and congratulated her husband Robert Vadra in a tweet and said that he will accompany her at every turn of life
 congress ne unhen party kaa mahasachiv banaaya gaya he, unhen purvi uttar pradesh kii kaman saunpi gai he
 She will take charge from the first week of February
 iske alaava congress saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya ko turant prabhaav se mahasachiv niyukt karke pashchimi upi kii kaman saunpi gai he
 Congress has announced this on Wednesday

 co / q7smb8m6do Let us know that senior party leader KC Venugopal has been given the responsibility of organization general secretary who will continue to play the role of incharge of Karnataka as before
 sanghathan mahasachiv kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe ashok gahalot ke rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad venugopal kii niyukti kii gai he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is playing the role of in-charge general secretary for Uttar Pradesh, has now been given the responsibility of Haryana
 dilli ke sabase bade aspataal ames main bihar se rojaanaa saikadon kii sankhya main log apana ilaaj karaane jate hai or isi samasya ko kam karne ke liye purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapei kii sarkaar main kai shaharon main dilli kii tarj par ames kholane kii kavayad shuru kii gai
 Patna was also lucky and AIIMS got a gift from that too
 7 saal kii deree ke baad aakhirkaar 2012 se patna main ames main kaam shuru hua
 a few days ago, Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey also said about Patna AIIMS that he wants the health services of Patna AIIMS to be made so good that people of Bihar do not have to go to Delhi for their treatment
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki 5 saal ke baad bhi kya patna ames main swasthya sevaayen itani behatar ho chuki hai ki bihar ke logon ko dilli ames nahin janaa pade?jamini hakeekat agar dekhenge to patna ames kii haalat aaj bhi aisi nahin hui he ki marij is santhaan main har rog kaa ilaaj karvaa paae
 This institute, built on the lines of Delhi AIIMS, is still functioning without basic facilities
 aspataal kii agar baat karen to yahaan sabase jaruri cheez hoti he immergency sevaayen, lekin patna ames ke banane ke 5 saal guzar jane ke baavjood bhi yahaan par apatkaal sevaayen ab tak shuru nahin hui hai
 There is a separate emergency department here, but it is not working
 aise main gambhir sthiti main kisi marij ko yahaan laayaa jaataa he to use yahaan se patna medical college yaa phir indira gandhi institute of medical science refer kar diya jaataa he
 Emergency services are not available in Patna AIIMS, as well as the lack of trauma center can be seen clearly
 patna ames main aaj bhi blad bank kii seva uplabdh nahin he
 a separate block has been constructed for the blood bank but it is not yet operational
 patna ames kaa nirmaan yah sochakar kiya gaya tha ki bihar or jharkhand ke log yahaan par aakar apana ilaaj karvaa paaenge or isi vajah se is bade santhaan main 28 oparation theatre kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya tha magar haalat yah ki aaj ke din keval chaar oparation theatre kaam kar rahe hai
 According to sources, there is also a shortage of specialist doctors in Patna AIIMS
 centre sarkaar ke dwaara patna ames main 304 doctoron or teacheron ke liye pad sweekrut he magar 5 saal biit jane ke baad bhi halaat yah he ki yahaan par keval 50 doctor karyrat hai
 According to the plan, Patna AIIMS was to be made a 1000-bed hospital and this institute has the same capacity but today only 200 beds are available here
 patna ames main aaj bhi shavgrih nahin he jisaki vajah se yahaan par kisi kii aprakritik mrityu ho jane par uskaa postmortem bhi nahin ho paata
 Aaj Tak reached Patna AIIMS and took stock of the situation and found that even after 5 years, construction work is still going on here
 aspataal main jahaan marij rahete hai or jahaan par safai honi chahie vahaan par rojaanaa kai trakon kaa aana janaa laga rahata he
 It carries loads of sand, cement, bricks and rebars
 aspataal ke paanch jagahon par abhi bhi nirmaan kaa kaary chal rahaa he
 Muzaffarnagar has been considered as the land of sugarcane and jaggery
 upar se raaginiyon kii raunak
 There has never been such riots in our area which has a sweetness in the air
 jaaton or musalamaanon yaa baaki jatiyon main bhi is tarah marane-maarane kii baat kabhi ai nahin
 People have lived there with great love and mutual understanding
 meraa gaanv budhaanaa mujffarnagar se yahi koi 30 kilometre dur he
 The kind of situation that happened in Muzaffarnagar this time, there could have been anything to happen there but people did not let anything happen at all
 iske liye main vaaki fakhr mahasoos karata hum
 i Feel Really Proud for That
 vahaan har birdari ke logon ne puri samajhadaari dikhaai or tay kar liya ki aisa kuch bhi nahin hone dena he
 Otherwise politics has been doing this
 kabhi state kii politics, kabhi jati kii, kabhi majahab kii
 It depends a lot on people how much preference they give to them
 yah sab asal main netaaon kaa, siyasat kaa banaaya hua he
 Politicians slowly bring people to such a platform and make them stand
 ghatana kuch or hoti he, rup kuch or de diya jaataa he use
 Politicians are all the same, they belong to any party
 unka koi or majahab nahin hota
 Idiots are people who fall for them
 sach puuchhie to main politysiuns kii bhi galati nahin maanata hum kyonki jab hamen pataa he ki ellection ke dauraan is tarah kii chijen hoti hai, aise daanv khele jate hai to logon ko khud satark rahanaa chahie tha
 The leaders want to cash in on everything on the occasion of election
 unki galati nahin he
 We must understand
 main to mumbai main rah rahaa hum
 From here on too, there is a frequent outing in connection with shooting, etc
 lekin dangon ke baad se jab bhi gaanv-ghar ke logon se meri baat hui he to ve bhi puri tarah se hairat or achambhe main hai
 They are saying that this is the first time that has happened in the villages and towns around us
 gharavaale hi kya, vahaan ke jitne bhi tyaagi, muslim, jat, sabhi samaajon ke log sadame main hai
 The biggest sin is to eliminate someone in the world
 or dange main jis tarah se log maar gaye isse badi koi trgidi or kya ho sakati he
 i am really sorry to hear about what has happened
 panchayatein hamaare ilaake kii khaas pahchaan rahi hai
 Especially when i talk about my village, i saw that small and big and sometimes complicated matters were also handled by calling panchayats of elders of every fraternity rather than going to police stations
 maamla zyada hi gadabada jaae to jaahir he, uske liye police thi hi
 But it was taken care that panchayats should also not be misused
 isamen do raay nahin ki vahaan ke logon kaa tone or atitude thodaa-sa agressive rahaa he or vah hameshaa se rahaa he
 Compared to other areas of the country or territory, the man of any religion, caste, is an aggression
 lekin koi bhi is extream par, is had tak nahin jaataa
 For this, an atmosphere has been created and people have been tricked
 yah sab usee kaa nateeja hoga
 There are many Hindu friends of mine there, everyone's messages are coming to me
 sabhi log aman-chaiyn kii hi dua maang rahe hai
 Nobody wants this, every man wants to eat his food
 vaise us ilaake kaa bura haal he
 When i sit through Delhi to go home through the road, on the way there will be a thousand posters of leaders and on the other side there will be a thousand pits on the same road
 unke khilaaf koi aawaaj nahin uthaata ki yaar, ye kya haal kar rakhaa he! pichley 25-30 saal se yahi haal he
 There is no such thing as Vikas
 to is tarah ke dange-fasaad kii bajaae in chizon ke liye ladiye na bhai! vahaan ke jo padhe-likhe log hai ve vahaan se isiilie nikal jate hai kyonki koi suvidhaayen hai nahin
 For this, you cannot blame any one government whether it is the fault of BJP or Congress or any one party
 ye to vahaan ke logon kii galati he
 Everyone is sitting with their hands on their hands, they do not mind
 jab khud vahaan ke rahane vaale log sawaal nahin uthaa rahe to koi doosraa bhala kyon sochega?khatra vaise tal gaya he
 i am sure there will be peace
 vahaan koi chor-daaku to basate nahin hai
 There was a frenzy, there was an impact, everybody got in his wrap
 vahaan jis tareeke se log rahete aae hai, use dekhte hue mujhe ummid he ki vahaan kaa taana-bana tuutane nahin paaegaa
 No one wants the frenzy to spread
 us ilaake ko asal main ek saanskrithik-saamaajik andolan kii jarurat he
 There is a strong need for such activities
 asal main kya he ki vahaan do fasalon ke bich main lanbaa gap hota he
 One crop has been cut and the other crop is still in time
 to aise main jo samay hota he, us dauraan soshal, cultural riform ke liye kuch ho to acha rahegaa
 This will allow the people there to get to know and connect with each other's conduct and traditions in the right context
 mujhe puri ummid he ki vahaan kii phija main vahi mithaas phir se lautegi

 is sammaan ko praapt karne vaali vah paanchavin bhartiya thim
 On the occasion of Priyanka Chopra's 36th birthday, we have brought for you some questions related to her life and film career
 
 
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne dilli police se kaha ki gaiyr sarkari sanghathan ‘india anguest karpshan’ or uske teen sadasyon dwaara raashtrapati pranab mukherjee par ‘aadharahin’ or ‘manahanijanak’ aarope lagane ke kaaran unke khilaaf praathmiki darj karne ke liye daayar kii gai yachika par kriyanvayan report daakhil kare
 Metropolitan Magistrate Ambika Singh asked the police to file their action report on Rajiv Khosla's complaint by September 3
 shikayatakarta khosla ne aarope lagaaya he ki iasi ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne janalokapal vidheyak ke liye apane haalia virodh pradarshan main raashtrapati mukherjee ke khilaaf apmanjanak or oche aarope lagaaye hai
 Khosla in his plea against Kejriwal, IAC and its two other members Manish Sisodia and Gopal Rai said that these people started their protest on 25 July and the same day Mukherjee was sworn in as the President of India
 media main ai khabaron kaa hawala dete huye khosla ne kaha ki jab mukherjee ne raashtrapati pad kii shapath lee tab kejariwal ne unki satyanishtha ke khilaaf ek ‘khulaa bayaan’ diya tha
 India managed to get an edge over the West Indies in the second Test cricket match despite a low score on the bowling of Ishant Sharma's career best bowling
 barish haalanki phir se khalanaayak banakar ubhari jiske kaaran tisare din keval 42 over kaa hi khel ho paaya
 Ishant played a key role in dismissing West Indies for 190 with six wickets for 55 runs
 pehali pari main 201 ran banane vaale bharat ko is tarah se 11 ran kii badhat mili
 Only 5 in India's second innings due to rain
 4 over kaa hi khel hua jisamen usne bina kisi nuksaan ke 23 ran banaaye
 India's lead is now 34 runs
 ampiron ne ruk-rukkar aati barish ke kaaran jab din kaa khel samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kii tab abhinav mukund aath or murali vijay teen ran par khel rahe the
 If Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma and West Indies middle-order batsman Malren Samuels were the heroes on the third day, then Rains again turned into a villain
 westeindies kii pari samaapt hone ke baad bharat kii duusari pari main jab keval paanch over ho paye the tabhi barish aa gayi jiske kaaran chaay kaa vishram jaldi lenaa padaa
 Even after this, the rain did not stop which ruined the game for two hours
 sthaneey samyaanusaar shaam paanch bajkar das minute par phir khel shuru hua lekin abhi keval chaar gend hi ho paayi thi ki kharaab roshni ke kaaran khel rokna padaa
 The umpires then declared the day's play to be over
 duusare din kaa adhiktar khel barish kii bhent chadhane ke baad tisare din bhi lagbhag 35 minute baad hi khel shuru ho paaya
 The West Indies started the game at 98 for five but Chanderpaul and Samuels batted with Dhriti despite the opposite circumstances and preferred to keep the wicket in view of the need of the team
 bharat ko aakhir main din kii pehali safalataa chandrapal kii galati se mili
 Mithun's round-the-wicket short pitch ball did not have much bounce but Chanderpaul went to the backfoot to pull it
 vah isamen asafal rahe or gend unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar viketon main samaa gayi
 After lunch, Harbhajan took advantage of the weakness of new batsman Carlton Bow against the spin
 harbhajan kii gend par unhone drive karne kii koshish lekin vah unke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa lekar pehali slip main khadey rahul dravid ke paas pahunch gayi
 Dravid catches the ball coming off Dhoni on his left
 bich main barish ke kaaran lagbhag 20 minute tak khel rukaa rahaa
 The West Indies then scored 189 for eight but after that the West Indies innings was reduced to three balls
 ishanth ne apana over aage jari rakhte hue lagaataar gend par ravi rampal or fidel edwards (donon shunya) ko out karke bharat ko badhat dilaayi
 Ishant gave the best performance of his career
 unhone isse pehle 2007 main pakistan ke khilaaf bangalore main 115 ran dekar paanch wicket liye the
 He took five or more wickets in the innings for the second time in his career
 bharat kingston main pehla test match 63 ran se jitkar shrinkhalaa main 1-0 se aage chal rahaa he
 According to the new data released by the central government, 23 out of 29 states and 6 out of 8 centrally empowered states will have more power than required in the current financial year
 central electricity athurity (CEA) ke mutabik vitt varsh 2017-18 main desh main bijli kii kul jarurat se 8
 There will be 8 percent more supply
 vahiin bijli khapat ke charam par bhi desh main 6
 8% more supply will remain
 aise main uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar se sawaal uthta he ki jab puure desh membijili supplaizarurat se adhik rahane ke asaar hai to phir uttar pradesh main kyon nirantar bijli supplai nahin kii ja paa rahi he? gauratlab he ki rajya main satta sanbhaalane ke baad se mukhyamantri ne pradesh main bijli supplai kii vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye kai kade kadam uthaae hai
 Apart from this, the state government has brought Uttar Pradesh on a 24-hour power supply map within the next two years
 lekin yogi sarkaar bijli vyavastha durust karne kii koshish or kendra sarkaar se madad kii kavayadke baavjood uske apane bijli gharon kii uniten thap hone se pradesh main bijli sankat gaharaata ja rahaa he
 So, while the Central Electricity Authority is claiming power surplus in the country, power cuts in Uttar Pradesh remain a constant reality
 bijli sankatka sabase zyada khamiyaja rajya ke gramin ilaakon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 To restore power supply in urban areas, efforts are being made to manage the situation by purchasing about 2000 MW power from Energy Exchange and other states
 chal rahi he
 It is worth noting that one unit of 660 MW of Lalitpur power house, 600 MW of Anpara, 600 MW of Lanco and 660 MW of Bara have been stalled in the state
 in badi uniton ke thap ho jane se pradesh ko kareeb 2500 megawatt bijli kii kami kaa jhatka lagane ja rahaa he
 Due to this, unannounced power cuts are being done for two to four hours in rural areas, while there are also unannounced cuts in urban areas
 rajasthan kii siyasat ke jaadugar ashok gahalot teesri baar mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 If someone's name will be at the top as a mass leader in the politics of Rajasthan, then it is Ashok Gehlot
 rahul ke sabase kareebi netaaon main unka naam aata he
 Pilot: While inherited Siasatgahlot will take over the reins of power, Sachin Pilot was crowned as Deputy CM
 payalat ko siyasat viraasat main mili he
 His father Rajesh Pilot was one of the prominent Gurjar leaders of the state
 sachin payalat ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 After the Congress defeat in 2014, the party leadership relied on Sachin Pilot on January 21 and made him the state president
 unki paanch saal kii mehnat ne congress kii satta main vaapasi karai
 In such a situation, he has been given the responsibility of the Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii maujuudagi main shapath lee
 Gehlot, the political magician of Rajasthan, tell that if anyone's name comes to the forefront of the top leaders, breaking caste domination in Rajasthan politics, it is Ashok Gehlot
 soobe main wo teesri baar mukhyamantri banane ja rahe hai
 Gehlot's family comes from the Mali community
 inkaa parivaar kisi jamaane main jaaduugari kaa kartab dikhaata tha
 Gehlot, coming from the politically minority and weaker caste of Rajasthan, worked such magic in Rajasthan during his tenure which no one has cut, as the incharge of Gujarat, he made a young trio of hardik-alpesh-jignesh standing with the Congress
 Launched the party to the threshold of victory
 jiske baad bataur sanghathan mahasachiv gahalot party ke kendriya netritv main adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke rhite hand ke taur par ubhare
 The eye of Indira, Sanjay brought the identity of Ashok Gehlot to the Congress in the 70s, when Sanjay Gandhi was in the party during the time of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 jab sanjay gandhi ke karibiyon ne unhen ashok gahalot ke bare main bataaya to unhone gahalot ko rajasthan main party ke chaatr sanghathan enesayuai kaa adhyaksh banaaya
 In the early days, people of Sanjay Gandhi's circle used to address Gehlot as 'gilli Billy'
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki ashok gahalot par sabase pehle swayan indira gandhi kii najar padi thi
 When the refugee crisis in the Northeast arose after the rebellion in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)
 gahalot kii umr us vakt 20 saal thi, or indira ne unhen raajnneeti main aane kaa nyotaa diya
 After which Gehlot took part in the All India Congress Committee's Indore conference and here he met Sanjay Gandhi
 yuva congress ke vistaar kaa daur jisane kai kaddavar netaa diecongress ke indore sammelan main divangat netaa priyaranjan dasamunshi yuva congress ke adhyaksh chune gaye the
 This was the time when Indira and Sanjay Gandhi wanted to prepare the Youth Congress to compete with the right wing Jana Sangh and its allies
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki congress main yah kaal yuva netritv ke ubhaar kaa svarnim kaal tha
 During this period, the party received many important leaders including Ashok Gehlot, Kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh, Ambika Soni, Vayalar Ravi, AK Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad and BK Hariprasad
 yah sabhi netaa aaj ke congress main badi haisiyat rakhte hai
 According to his nature and simple background, Ashok Gehlot continued to work in Rajasthan keeping a low profile
 lekin sanjay gandhi kii vimaan haadase main maut ke baad jab party main rajeev gandhi ko ahm role mila, tab unhone gahalot ke naam kii sifarish indira gandhi kii cabinet main rajyamantri ke taur par kii
 During this time, two big leaders of the Congress in Rajasthan were dominated by former Chief Minister Haridev Joshi and Shivcharan Mathur
 lekin gahalot ko rajeev gandhi kaa bharosa hasil tha
 The incident that cleared the way for Gehlot is a famous incident when Rajasthan was reeling under a severe drought and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called a cabinet meeting at Sariska National Park, 170 km from Delhi
 is baithak main rajeev ne rajya ke sabhi mantriyon ko sarkari gadiyon kii bajaay apni gaadi se aane ke nirdesh die the or rajeev khud ek nijee car chalaa rahe the
 Then a traffic constable asked Rajiv's car to turn right instead of giving a signal to go straight
 consteble kii is galati kaa parinaam haridev joshi ke liye mahangaa sabit hua, kyonki diavarjan kii vajah se rajeev us sthaan par pahunch gaye jahaan mantriyon kii sarkari gaadiyaan khadi thim
 Actually Rajiv wanted to give a message of austerity in the party and the government through it
 rajeev gandhi kii naaraazgi kii vajah se joshi lunch main shaamil nahin hue, tab mejabaan joshi kii anupasthiti main unke mitra or centre main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri pivi narsimha raav ne maamle ko thanda karne kii naakaam koshish kii
 And a month after this incident, Haridev Joshi was replaced by Shiv Charan Mathur as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 bhale hi lagbhag do saal baad joshi ne phir vaapasi kar lee ho, lekin iske baad congress alaakaman ke saamne unki wo dhak nahin rahi
 During the indelible impression left at the center, Gehlot was playing the role of the Minister of Tourism in the Central Government
 rashtriya rajdhani main iene market ke thik saamne dilli haat ke nirmaan kaa shrey gahalot ko jaataa he jinhone desh bhar ke shilpkaar, hastshilp kala ke logon ke utpaada ko sidhe graahakon tak bina kisi bichauliye ke pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 Gehlot's proximity to Rajiv did not let his role diminish in the Congress headed by Sonia Gandhi and then Rahul Gandhi
 1998 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii haar hui or bhaerosingh shekhavat ke baad ashok gahalot ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 Gehlot was not an MLA at this time, so Mansingh Deora, MLA from Sardarpura Assembly of Jodhpur vacated the seat for him
 jiske baad hue upachunaav main jeet ke baad se gahalot lagaataar is seat se vidhayak hai
 If the Jats are disillusioned with the Congress, the Congress lost its traditional Jat vote in Rajasthan when Ashok Gehlot, who came from the Mali community, became the Chief Minister
 rajputon ke dhur virdohi jat rajasthan main 60-70 siton par nirnaayak bhoomika main rahete hai
 Jats were inclined towards the Congress from the first assembly elections in the state as the Congress abolished the monarchy
 congress ke bade jat netaa ramanivas mirdha, nathuram mirdha, parsaram maderna kaa marwar main jabardast bolbalaa tha
 These leaders did not allow this fort to collapse even after the Emergency when the Congress was wiped out of North India
 apni vafadari ke liye lambey samay tak is samudaay ke netaa mukhyamantri banane aas lagaae rahen
 But after Ashok Gehlot became CM in 1998, his fascination continued to dissolve
 abhi bhi sarvamaanya hai gahalotrajasthan kii raajnneeti main maas leader ke taur par yadi kisi kaa naam sabase upar hoga to wo ashok gahalot hi honge
 Coming from a politically minority and weaker caste, Gehlot, during his tenure, played such a magic in Rajasthan that no one has the bite
 gahalot kaa raajnneetik kaushal hi tha ki 1998 main mukhyamantri ke prabal daavedaar parsaram maderna ko peeche chhodte hue ve satta ke shikhar par pahunche

 bijepi kii upaadhyaksh smriti irani ne ajtak channel ke sidhi baat kaarykram main hedlins today ke managing editor rahul kanwal se baatcheet kii
 Here are the key parts of the conversation
 surat main 12 disambar, 2004 ko aapane bayaan diya tha ki gujarat dangon kaa dosha vaajapeyi or adwani par aa rahaa he jabaki aana chahie modi par, jo apni kursi nahin chhod rahe
 Your thinking has changed a lot in eight years
 aisa kyon?maine media main kai reports padhi, suni thim, jinke aadhaar par maine andaja lagaaya tha
 i guess that was wrong
 main sanghathan ke madhyam se sanghathan or sarkaar ko zyada samajhuungi
 After that, if i reach any conclusion then i will do it by staying in the dignity of the organization
 raajnneetik majaburi hui to aapane soch badal di
 There is no principle? i also spoke at the India Today Conclave in 2013 that many media stalwarts sometimes use Modi's name for TRP
 narendra modi nae votaron ko lubhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Wouldn't it be better that they say what happened was wrong? This will increase people's trust in them
 unhone kaha ki mere khilaaf ek bhi tathy ho to mujhe faansee par chadha do
 An interview said that what happened in Godhra is sad but it is not an excuse to take the law into our own hands
 jediu ko narendra modi ke naam se parhez he
 What will i do to overcome it? My scope of responsibility is limited to BJP
 elise se jo charchaa kerani hogi vah ham aamane-saamne baithkar karenge
 Modi is campaigning across the country
 vahiin party main kai aise log hai jo lagaataar kehete rahete hai ki ve kisi or ko pasand karte hai or agali sarkaar laalkrishna adwani ke netritv main banegi
 How long will there be confusion about Modi? There is no confusion
 hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh ne kaha ki hamaare pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa faisla parliamentary board karegaa
 The reality of Vibrant Gujarat is that there is a huge difference between the claims that are made and the actual investment that comes
 aisa kyon?bharat sarkaar kahati he ki jo 100 naukariyaan milti hai usamen se 72 gujarat kii vajah se milti he
 This is the Government of India data
 modi se jab poocha gaya ki gujarat main kuposhan itnaa zyada kyon he? to unhone kaha ki gujarat kii ladkiyaan fishan kanshious bahut hai, is vajah se khaanaa nahin khaatin or isiilie kuposhan he
 The ICDS report states that the Delhi government has failed to fight the serious problem of malnutrition
 usamen gujarat sarkaar kii saraahna kii gai he
 Your opinion on Rahul vs Modi? On the one hand there are experienced leaders who worked hard on the promises of development, gave the result
 duusari taraf aise vyakti hai, jo abhi bhi apane shabdon or khyaalon ko talash rahe hai

 congress ko isse chunaav main phayda ho saktaa he?main poochna chaahati hum ki jab (dilli gang rape ke vakt) anti-lau discas ho rahaa tha tab kya rahul gandhi loksabhaa main the? dibet hui tab bhi nahin the

 'svachh bharat mishan gramin' ke antargat ab is disha main ham aage bad rahe hai
 What will happen? The goal has been set to use beneficiaries' dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, all of them to make biogas based energy
 'gobar dhan yojana' ke tahat gramin bharat main kisaanon, bahanon, bhaaiyon ko protsaahit kiya jayega ki wo gobar or kachare ko sirf kachare ke rup main nahin balki aay ke strot ke rup main dekhen

 - Biogas will increase self-sufficiency in energy for cooking and lighting
 - kisaanon evam pashupalkon ko aamadani badhaane main madad milegi
 - New job opportunities will be available for sale of biogas etc
 aise hoga kaam- gobar dhan yojana ke sucharu vyavastha ke liye ek online trading plateform bhi banaaya jayega jo kisaanon ko kharidaaron se conect karegaa taaki kisaanon ko gobar or agriculture west kaa sahi daam mil sake
