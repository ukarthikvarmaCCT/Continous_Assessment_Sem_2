 The Indian Army has been blocked for promotion and medically unfit officers will now be admitted to the IPS to protect the common citizens of the country! The government is bent on making the IPS those who are not considered fit for the security of the country
 yah sab hone ja rahaa he ipies kii bhartee ke liye kendriya grih mantralay kii ore se shuru kii gai simit seva pariksha ke tahat
 This can include officers who have worked for five years at DSP rank, major-captain of the Army and Assistant Commandant level officers of paramilitary forces
 centre ke is prastaav ko sena pehle hi adhikariyon kii kami bataakar khaarij kar chuki he
 But angry with the stubborn approach of the Home Ministry and the commencement of the recruitment process on behalf of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the Army issued a note to all its headquarters that "who do not meet the medical standards, continue to appear in the examination for promotion
" Failing, unqualified permanent commissioners and failing officers on all other parameters of the army "can appear in this examination
" centre ne desh bhar main ipies adhikariyon kii kami ko puraa karne ke makasad se sena or ardh sainik balon ke adhikariyon ko ipies banane kaa nayab formula nikaala he
 This creates a deep indignation not only in the army but also in the entire police force
 ipies or rajya ke police sanghon ne ek saath desh ke kai hycorton main is faisle ke khilaaf cese daayar kiye hai
 Most of the state governments have already expressed their objection
 ipies association ke saath-saath rajya police sanghon ne sarkaar se aar-paar kii ladaai kii ranneeti bana lee he
 Total 20 policemen
 64 lakh padon main se 5 lakh yani ek chauthai pad arase se khaali hai
 On the other hand, out of the total 4,720 posts of the IPS, 1,327 i
e
 about one-third of the posts are vacant
 mjedaar baat yah he ki pichley teen saal main 44 ipies nijee kaarnon yaa duusari vajahon se rutabe vaali is naukari ko alavida kah chuke hai
 The lack of officers has had an impact on law and order
 ipies afasaron kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamale ke baad kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram constituted a committee under the leadership of retired IPS Kamal Kumar
 usee kii sifarish ke aadhaar par sidhi bhartee or padonnati kealawa teesri prakriya ke taur par simit seva pratiyogita ko apanaaya gaya
 Only DSP, Assistant Commandant level officers of Central Security Forces and captain-major of the Army will be eligible
 iske liye 35 saal kii aayu seemaa ke saath obisi ko ek saal or essi-asti ko do saal kii chhot di gai he
 For the first time this kind of recruitment applications have been sought from 19 April and the examination is scheduled from 20 to 24 May
 lekin essi-asti ke maamle main aayu sambandhi vivaad or puri prakriya par roak lagane ko lekar ladaai police or centre sarkaar ke bich kii ho gai he
 Based on the Kamal Kumar Committee report, the Center increased the batch of IPS from 130 to 150
 lekin padonnati kaa kota 33 fisadi se aage nahin badhaayaa gaya, jabaki cameti ne isaki sifarish kii thi
 The ministry had given instructions to the Union Public Service Commission to start emergency recruitment from 2012 itself last year
 is tarah kii bhartee pehali baar nahin ho rahi he
 At the beginning of the war with China in 1962, officers of the Administrative Service were placed in military cadres as part of a plan
 vah prakriya 1973 tak chali thi
 But now the Home Ministry wants to fill the vacant posts of IPS as soon as possible to deal with Naxalism firmly
 is puure vivaad par kendriya grih rajyamantri jitendra singh takneekee pahaluon se khud ko anjaan bataate hai
 But justifying the recruitment exams, he says, "IPS has a long backlog and will be able to fill vacancies after seven years even through limited competition examination
 ''haalanki vivaad or sena ke circular par tippanee se parhez karte hue ve kehete hai, ''iske bare main mujhe apane varisht mantri pi
 Information has to be taken from Chidambaram, only then any comment can be made
 '' ardh sainik balon or ipies ke prashikshan main fark ko ve maanate hai, lekin kehete hai, ''nai bhartee se aane waalon ko bhi usee tarah kii training di jaaegi
 Chidambaram's response to this could not be found
 police mahakme ke log nae faisle se bhannaae hue hai
 "the decision is discriminatory against existing IPS and officers of the state police service," says Manoj Ibrahim, Kerala's Inspector General of Police (headquarters) and secretary of the state IPS Association
 isse police ke kaamkaaj par asar padegaa
 Limited service competition examination is completely against minorities, women and police force
 ''association is bhartee prakriya par roak lagane ke liye kerala ke cat main yachika daakhil karne ke saath-saath mukhyamantri ko gyaapan bhi diya he or saansadon ko iske khilaaf lamaband karne main bhi juta he
 Dharamvir Singh Yadav, vice-president of Madhya Pradesh Police Service Association and police superintendent of Bhopal ATS, termed the Centre's decision as completely unjust: "we will appeal for justice in the court
" sanvaidhanik, kanoonee or aayu sambandhi vivaad ko lekar uhapoh he, isliye sarkaar ko apane faisle par amal se pehle punarvichaar karnaa chahie kyonki is nai bhartee ko lekar kisi bhi str par sahmati nahin he
 "yadav adds," "the training of army and paramilitary forces is exclusively for war and other tasks, while police work is completely different
" isse police bal main nayaa gut penpega
 However, while appearing in the Delhi High Court, the Center has justified the decision of the Special Examination, arguing that not only has approval been taken from the UPSC in this matter, but it has also prepared the pattern of questions
 centre ne apni daleel main rajyon se salaah-mashvira kiye jane kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 a decision in this matter is to come on April 25, while Delhi Police officials have also prepared to go to CAT
 hycourt main yachikakarta jakaat foundation ke adhyaksh da
 Syed Zafar Mehmood says, "the scale of merit that has been kept in this recruitment will kill the rights of Muslims
" '' ve kehete hai, ''grih mantri ke str par hi sena, desh ke aadhe se adhik rajyon or kendriya suraksha balon kii aapatti ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 The UPSC even went so far as to say that a thousand candidates were sitting for a post through the civil service, then there would be only three contenders for one position in the new recruitment
 ''adaalaton or cat main daakhil alag-alag yachikaaon main kai anya sanvaidhanik-kanoonee masale bhi uthaae gaye hai
 If the Center has not given any argument for not accepting the opinion of the states, then a petition has said that IPS has been amended for recruitment, but no change was made in the law of the army and security forces
 india today ne apni padtaal main paaya ki rajyon se salaah-mashvira sirf khanaapurti ke liye kiya gaya he
 Most of the state governments, not only the paramilitary forces and the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) under the Ministry of Home Affairs, UPSC have also termed the limited competition exam as non-essential and to strengthen the already existing two types of recruitment Emphasized centre sarkaar kii manshaa par kutharaghaat upiessi or ardh sainik balon kii raay ne bhi kiya he
 After several rounds of discussion by UPSC, on 15 March 2010, the then Home Secretary
 ke
 In his letter to Pillai, the new recruit was described as "completely impractical"
 beepiardi ne bhi 26 agast, 2010 ko likhi apni chitthee main is par aapatti jataai he
 According to him, the quality of IPS selected through open competition is better and people take it as a passion
 par nai pranali main ise dspi or ardh sainik balon tak simit karne se isaki gunvattta prabhavit hogi
 The ITBP has also raised fears of frustration within the paramilitary forces due to this new recruitment exam
 itibipi ne apane yahaan pehle se hi commander str ke adhikariyon kii kami kii daleel dete hue likhaa he, '' isse ipies kii gunvattta prabhavit hogi or kendriya police sanghathan ke un adhikariyon main bhi kuntha kaa bhav paidaa hoga, jo aayu seemaa kii vajah se is maukey se vanchit rah jaaenge
 The compulsions have also been expressed by the CISF
 commandent str ke adhikariyon kii pehle se hi kami kaa tark dete hue usne kaha he ki simit pratiyogita pariksha ke jariye ipies kii bhartee se uski gunvattta prabhavit hone kii ashanka he
 Uttar Pradesh, among the state governments, had opposed the new recruitment on 15 September 2010, counting six important points in its reply to the Center
 usne nai vyavastha se varishthata ko lekar police main gutbaji or manmutav badhane kaa andeshaa jataayaa tha
 It believes that there is a difference between the training of officers coming from army and paramilitary forces and training of IPS
 aise main sena se jude logon ko police bal ke rup main dhaalnaa vyaavhaarik taur par kathin hoga
 UP Police Service Association has filed petition in Allahabad High Court
 sangh ke adhyaksh or varanasi ke espi (intelligence) jugal kishor sharma kehete hai, ''behatar hota agar rajya police seva ke adhikariyon ke padonnati ke cote ko nagaland or jammu-kashmir kii tarah badhaakar ek baar main sari riktiyaan bhar lee jaatin
 "one of Sharma's important arguments is that the new system will increase unemployment in the talent and will give opportunity to those already working
" isi tarah chhattisgarh police seva sangh ne bhi 8 april ko hycourt main yachika daakhil kii he
 President of the Union and Additional Superintendent of Police of Raipur, Dr
 laal ummed singh kehete hai, ''padonnati ke jariye rictiyon ko puraa kiya janaa chahie
 The Chhattisgarh government, in a reply sent to the Center on 22 January 2011, dismissed this test outright and termed it as a morale-lowering move of the police force
 nagaland ne is formule kii bajaae padonnati ke jariye rajya police se ipies banane ke cote ko 33
 It has been asked to increase from 5 per cent to 50 per cent for five years so that there is no dispute and the vacancies of IPS are filled
 kerala sarkaar ne padonnati se sabhi 490 rictiyon ko bharne kaa sujhav diya he
 States like Meghalaya, Tripura, Punjab, Goa, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh have also made similar suggestions
 jaipur ke atirikt police adheekshak or rajasthan police seva sangh ke sachiv narayan togus ke mutabik, ''bhartee se pehle hi vivaadon kijhadi lag gai he
 People are getting permission to go to Central Tribunal for relaxation in age limit
 '' ve kehete hai, ''hamaara sangh iske khilaaf adaalat jane kii taiyaari main he
 "SC-ST officers are applying for this recruitment by bringing special exemption through CAT
 pariksha adhisuchana main rictiyon kii sankhya bhi tay nahin he or parinaam ke baad hi mantralay siten tay karegaa
 The situation is also not clear about reservation, due to which questions are being raised on the government's intention
 police sanghon or rajya sarkaron kii raay se spasht he ki is bhartee pranali se jahaan police main senior-junior kaa vivaad badhegaa, vahaan rajya police or ipies ke alaava teesraa gut ubhar saktaa he
 The level of limited competition examination is also much simpler than the Civil Services Examination
 sena or kendriya police sanghathan se aae log seva kaal or aayu kii vajah se police ke shirshatam padon par pahunch sakate hai, jisase civil seva kii pariksha paas kar aae ipies varg kaa manobal giregaa
 Clearly, the controversy has taken a big shape regarding this plan of the Center

 shauk jab bade hon to kai baar kaam bhi bade paimaane par karne padate hai
 Now the love of having 16 to 16 girlfriends can be no small-time hobby
 jaahir he ye behad kharchila shauk bhi hoga
 So to fulfill this big and expensive hobby, he decided to give a big hand
 or wo bhi badi or mahangi gadiyon main baith kar
 There were many thieves in India, but in those groups of thieves, this thief was different
 kyonki iske liye chori nahin shauk badi cheez he
 He used to shine lights in the wedding of others
 band-baaja or baraat ke saath kandhe par lite uthaa kar chalata tha
 But in that light his eyes were blurred by the picture of good and bad, right and wrong
 or phir dekhte hi dekhte wo chor ban baitha
 First became a slave to his hobby and then a thief to fulfill his hobby
 ab zaahir he jisaki 16 garlfriend hogin, shauk uske liye badi cheez hi hogi
 Then, like the nobles, see the theft of this thief live before you learn the exploits of this rich thief who sits in the car of the nobles and steals the car of the nobles
 kyonki isi live chori ke chalate ye pakadaa gaya
 a residential area of sector 17A, one of the most posh areas of Noida, close to Delhi
 ilaake main ek audi car gum rahi he
 This black colored Audi A7 series car sometimes roams the streets, sometimes stops outside a house
 car se utar kar ek shaks ghar ke andar daakhil hota he or kuch der baad nikal aata he
 Robin alias Rahul, who stepped into Delhi about ten years before Hisar in Haryana, had short hair
 yun kahen ki wo ganja tha
 But this baldness made him his weapon
 wo wig laga kar chori karne laga
 And as per the requirement, CCTV cameras and policemen were also deceived by this wig
 haalat aisi thi ki kuch log use baalo se jaanate the, kuch ganje sar se
 The millionaire who became a jerk, now Robin, who lived in Muflissi, started sitting in big trains and blowing big cars
 or ek hi jatke main karodpati ban gaya
 Now that the money has come, the hobbies have also changed
 police kii maane to jab wo pakadaa gaya, uske paas se sirf audi, bmdablyoo or fortuner jaisi mahangi gaadiyaan hi nahin mili, ye bhi pataa chalaa ki uski ek do nahin balki 16 garlfrends hai
 And fulfilling the demands of these girls is also one of the reasons for her stealing
 lekin audi main gum kar tamaam tarah kii hai and kaaren chura-chura kar dilli ensiaar kii police kii naak main dam karanevaale is shaatir chor kii khabar pashchimi dilli police kii anti auto thept skhwaid ko lag gai or wo dhar liya gaya
 If the idiot of theft stolen from movies is believed to have read this vicious thief till 12th
 usne padhai ke baad choti-moti naukariyaan bhi kii, lekin wo shuru se bada haath maarna chahta tha
 So, he quit his job
 phir usne kai filmein dekhin or filmon se hi chori kaa idia chura liya
 At the moment he is not alone, but the entire gang is with him
 magar chota gang
 Because he believes that the lesser the number of people in the gang, the lesser the chance of being caught
 philhal haalat ye he ki wo 30 se zyaada aaleeshaan gaadiyaan chura chukaa he or wo bhi baqayada order lekar

 Because the Muslim community had a large population here

 aise main vitt mantriarun jetali 4 oktober ko exise duty main dedh rupye kii katautee or marketing companiyon ne ek rupye kii katautee kaa elaan kiya
 This gave the citizens a small relief of two and a half rupees
 centre sarkaar ne rajya sarkaron se bhi apil main kaha ki wo bhi waite dhai rupye ghataae jisase logon ko kam se kam 5 rupe katautee kaa laabh mil sake
 a month before this cut, on 2 September, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan blamed external reasons for increasing domestic prices of petrol and diesel
 kya pradhan kaa ye kathan sahi tha? agar aisa tha to kaise ek maheene baad hi vitt mantri jetali ne dhai rupye kii katautee kii or kai rajyon main kul 5 rupye kii katautee ko sunishchit kiya?thodi raahat dekar logon kii naaraazgi kam karne kii koshishpetroleum mantri bahari kaarnon ko jimmedaar bataane ke apane bayaan main aanshik rup se sahi the
 Because international prices of crude oil (crude) play to some extent in deciding domestic prices of petroleum products
 lekin na to petroleum mantri or na hi vitt mantri ne ye zikr kiya ki may 2014 semodi sarkaarkendriya exise duty main 12 guna badhotaree kar chuki he
 In these 4 years, the excise duty has increased by 211% on petrol and 443% on diesel

 chunaavon main di jaati he raahatye pehali baar nahin tha ki jab sarkaar ne apni ore se petroleum utpaadon kii keemton ko lekar logon ko raahat dene kii koshish kii
 During the Karnataka Assembly elections, it was also observed that the prices of petroleum products were kept apart from fluctuations for 20 consecutive days (from 24 April to 14 May 2018)
 isi tarah gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi 13 din tak (1 disambar se 14 disambar tak) petroleum utpaadon kii keemton ko badlaav se alag rakhaa gaya
 How Petroleum Products Prices Are Used Using Right to Information (RTI) India Today sought to know from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas how the prices of petroleum products are fixed? Information was also sought as to what were the prices of crude oil (crude), petrol and diesel between 24 April to 14 May 2018 and again from 1 December to 14 December 2017? Cited the prices of crude oil (crude) and petrol and diesel
 Gaya Hindustan Petroleum in response said, "government of India has fixed the prices of petrol from 26 June 2010 and diesel prices from 19 October 2014 on market basis
 " jawaab se sabit hota he ki petrol utpaadon kii keemten tay hone main sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 But in response to this RTI, the prices of crude oil (crude) and petrol and diesel have been cited, which shows that despite the increase in crude prices, the prices of petroleum products remained stable

 congress pravaktaa raaj babbar kaa kahana he ki arunachal main sarkaar giraane ke khilaaf congress sadak se sansad tak ladegi
 According to him, there are many non-bjp ruled states targeted by the Modi government at the center
 aaj congress kii sarkaar giraayi gai he, kal kisi or dal kii rajya sarkaar par khatra ho saktaa he
 Everyone needs to unite against this dictatorial attitude and expose the Modi government
 tippaniyan However, how far the efforts of the Congress will be able to pay off, it will also depend on the attitude of a leader like Mulayam Singh Yadav
 congress kah rahi he ki arunachal pradesh main na to kanoon-vyavastha kharaab hui thi or na hi bhrashtachar kaa koi maamla sabit hua tha
 The Congress is directly describing this as a BJP conspiracy and accusing the governor of acting like an agent of the BJP
 uski ye bhi daleel he ki 21 july, 2015 ko vidhansabha satr ke sthagan ke baad arunachal vidhansabha kaa satr congress ne 14 janvari, 2016 ko bulaanaa tay kiya tha
 But without the consent of the Chief Minister, the Governor violated his limits by calling an assembly session in a community building on 16 December
 in daleelon ke saath philhal congress court main apni ladaai ladegi
 If the court gets relief, then otherwise, after this legal battle, the Congress will politically hand over the government
 haalanki congress kii koshish kahaan tak rang laa paaegi, ye kaaphi kuch mulaayam singh yadav jaise netaa ke rukh par bhi nirbhar karegaa
 The Congress is saying that neither law and order had deteriorated in Arunachal Pradesh nor any case of corruption was proved
 congress ise sidhe taur par bijepi kii sajeesh bataa rahi he or governor par bijepi ke agent kii tarah kaam karne kaa aarope laga rahi he
 It also argues that after the adjournment of the assembly session on July 21, 2015, the Congress had decided to call the session of Arunachal Assembly on January 14, 2016
 lekin bina mukhyamantri kii sahmati ke governor ne 16 disambar ko ek saamudayik bhawan main vidhansabha satr bulaakar apni seemaa kaa ulanghan kiya
 With these arguments, the Congress will fight its battle in the court
 court se raahat mil gai to thik, nahin to is kanoonee ladaai ke baad congress raajnneetik taur par sarkaar se do-do haath karegi
 The Congress is directly describing this as a BJP conspiracy and accusing the governor of acting like an agent of the BJP

 metro main kiraaye main beete dinon hui badhotaree ke baad ab metro main safar karne vaale logon ko ek or jhatka laga he
 Delhi Metro has decided to increase the parking fee by 50%
 aise main rojaanaa safar karne vaale log hairaan hai kyonki unka kharch ab badhane ja rahaa he
 The government wants to walk
 After the increase in Metro parking fees, the people who are away from the metro station are the most upset and they usually travel by metro
 aise main log apane ghar se apni khud kii gaadi se metro stesan tak jate the or vahaan gaadi park kar metro se safar karte the
 But after the increase in parking fee, now people are feeling kothaga on their own
 yamuna bank metro stesan par apni gaadi park karne aae rajeev kehete hai ki sarkaar kii jeb metro kiraye main badhotaree ke baad bhi nahin bhari to ab metro kii parking ke bhi daam badha die hai, jahaan par rojaanaa 10 rupee kharch hote the ab 15 se 20 rupee kharch hone lage hai
 That means it will cost 200 to 300 rupees more in a month
 petrol ke baad parking kii marmetro yatriyon se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki adhiktar yatri kah rahe hai ki petrol ke daam record str tak pahunch gaye hai
 In such a situation, he travels by metro, but the government has not stopped till the increase in the price of the metro, now the government has increased the burden of doubling the parking fee
 sarkaar ne pehle khud kii gaadi se chalane laayak nahin choda ab metro se safar bhi mushkil ho gaya he, ab sirf paidal chalane kaa vikalp hi bachaa he
 Many stations are far from overpopulated when many stations in Delhi are away from the population
 aise main logon ko naa to metro stesan tak pahunchane kii sawari milti he or naa hi vahaan par public transport chalata he
 Most of these areas fall in the outskirts of Delhi
 aise main sabase zyada un logon ko hi dikkat aegi jo abhi tak apni gaadi se metro stesan tak aate the
 At the same time, people were angry with the increase in the prices of monthly pass
 logon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko ulta ham logon ko sabsidi deni chahie thi or ab sarkaar shulk badhaakar public transport ko hatotsahit kar rahi he
 Dilip Pandey said - Kejriwal has already warned Aam Aadmi Party is looking very aggressive after Thametro's decision to increase the parking fee
 party pravaktaa dilip pandey ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki sarkaar hameshaa desh ke aam aadmi ke khilaaf khadi najar aati he
 Dilip Pandey said, Arvind Kejriwal had already said that the increase in fares will reduce the rider ship of Delhi Metro, exactly the same happened
 aise main ek baar phir se dilli metro ne parking shulk main badhotaree kar sarkaar ne aam aadmi ke bajet par hamalaa bolaa he
 In other countries, the government gives subsidy on the metro
 Dilip Pandey has said that governments in other countries give subsidy to promote public transport
 khud se funding dekar public se kam se kam paisa vasula jaataa he, taaki pradooshan or jam jaise halaaton se nipta ja sake, lekin yahaan par sarkaar ulta kar rahi he
 The government wants people not to go by metro

 padhai-likhaai main puraa dhyaan lagaana or jitod mehnat karnaa acchhee baat he
 But by doing everything you will get success, it is not necessary every time
 yahi vajah he ki hamaare dharamshastron ke is bare main kuch khaas sanket kiye gaye hai, jisase safalataa milane main baadhaaen na aaen
 It is advisable to take care of some special things while reading and writing in this easy mantra of meditation
 aage aisi hi baton kii charchaa kii gai he
 
 
 1
 purab disha kii ore munh karke padhenstudy room main padhai kii mej is tarah lagaaein ki us dauraan aapkaa munh purab disha kii ore rahe
 It is believed that it gives more positive energy
 surya ko devtaa mana jaataa he
 It is the largest source of energy
 adhyayan ke dauraan kamare main bharpoor roshni bhi honi chahie, jisase ankhon ko zyada takalif na ho
 Probably for these reasons, it is considered better to study towards the east
 2
 Do not sit down, sit and study
 Many times students study only lying on the bed instead of table-chair due to laziness
 agar kuch aisi chijen padhani-likhni ho, jiskaa pariksha se koi lenaa-dena na ho, tab to koi baat nahin
 But if things are related to the course, then read it on the table
 aisi manyata he ki jab maanav sharir lambavat rahata he, to dimag zyada active rahata he or baaten zyada yaad rahati hai
 Reading like a chameleon has not been described as appropriate
 3
 Do not turn the pages with the folded hands, do not touch the book-copy etc
 with the folded hands while doing leg-writing
 mej par koi khaane-pine kii chijen na rakhen
 If you want to eat something, get up, eat and then wash your hands and start studying
 4
 Avoid studying in the evening, but should avoid studying in the evening, that is, when the day is falling and gradually it is going to be night
 ise shastron main 'godhuli bela' kaha gaya he
 This is the time when cows graze from outside and return to their habitat
 5
 Do not move your head or feet while remembering
 Some students have a habit of repeatedly shaking their head or feet while remembering something
 aisa karnaa thik nahin hai
 While keeping the mind calm while reading, the body should also be stable

 If Jadeja Cook did not leave that catch, we would have been our new captain today
 yah kahana he england ke purv coach ashley jailes kaa
 In view of England's poor performance in the ODI series against India, there is a demand for the removal of Alastair Cook as the one-day captain, but former coach Ashley Giles believes that it is too late as the World Cup is only five months away
 jailes ne bibisi radio 5 live se kaha, ‘main use captain banaaye rakhane ke paksh main hum kyonki world cap kareeb he
 This is important from a leadership point of view

 Giles has been the coach of England's ODI team since 2012 until the beginning of this year
 unhone kaha ki yadi england ek or siries ganvaata he to cook kii sthiti asthir ho sakati he
 He said, 'seven odis against Sri Lanka will be very important
 vahaan jeet darj karnaa bahut mushkil he isliye yadi dabaav banataa rahaa or cook ke khilaaf lagaataar aawaaj uthati rahi to phir siries ke aakhir main unki sthiti asthir ho sakati he
 Giles said that if Cook had not played two good innings against India before the ODI, he would have been demanding removal from the Test captaincy
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi ravindra jadeja southampton main vah kaich nahin chodta jabaki cook 15 ran par the to ho saktaa he ki is samay hamaara nayaa captain hota
 But now it is too late to make changes
 cook ko abhi kuch or samay diya janaa chahie

 (d)haryana Today is the Tritiya of Shukla Paksha of Vaishakh month on 7th May
 log is tithi ko akshay tritiya ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 But this date is very special in another sense
 is din bhagwaan vishnu ke chathe avatar bhagwaan parashuram kaa bhi janm hua tha
 Lord Parashurama was the son of sages Jamadagni and Renuka
 parashuram ko nyaay kaa devtaa mana jaataa he
 He was the obedient son of his parents
 baavjood iske unhone apni mata kii gardan kaat di thi
 Let's know why Parashurama had to cut his mother's neck and then what happened to him
 brahravaivart puraana ke anusaar, srihari vishnu ke aathven avatar bhagwaan parashuram mata renuka or rishi jamadagni kii chauthi santan the
 Lord Parashurama, the knower of weapons and weapons, was once commanded by his father to kill his mother
 bhagwaan parashuram behad aagyaakaari putr the
 He immediately removed his mother's head from his torso with his hand, after receiving his father's order
 apni ajna kaa paalan hote dekh bhagwaan parashuram ke pita rishi jamadagni apane putr se behad prasann hue
 Seeing his father happy, Parashuram urged his father to revive mother Renuka
 jyotishacharya pandit arunesh kumaar sharmaane bataaya ki parashuram bhagwaan vishnu ke aaveshavatar maane jate hai
 He explained in detail the story of Mata Renuka slaughter by Parashurama and said that once the sage had gone for a bath in wife Sarovar
 sanyog se vahaan raja chitrarath naukavihar kar rahe the
 Seeing the king, Rishipatni developed a disorder in her heart and she returned to the ashram in the same mood from there
 ashram main rishi jamadagni ne jab patni kii yah vikargrast dasha dekhi to unhen sab gyaat ho gaya
 Due to which the sage became very angry
 unhone pehle parashuram ke agrajon ko mata ke vadh kaa aadesh diya
 But none of his sons disobeyed their orders from their mother
 lekin jab pita ne maa kaa vadh karne ke liye parashuram se kaha to unhone pita kii ajna kaa aksharshah paalan kiya
 At this the sage cursed the disobedient sons to lose their conscience
 parashuram se prasann hokar unhone use manachaaha var maangane ke liye kaha
 On this, Parashuram granted his mother a new life by seeking a boon to revive her mother
 apane putr kii teevr buddhi dekhakar atiprasann rishipita ne parashuram ko dikdigant tak khyaati arjeet karne or samast shaastra or shastr kaa gyaata hone kaa aashirwad diya
 But Parashurama killed his mother at the behest of his father
 jisaki vajah se unhen matra hatya kaa paap bhi laga
 He got freedom from this sin after doing rigorous penance of Lord Shiva
 bhagwaan shiv ne parashuram ko mrityulok ke kalyanarth parashu astr pradaan kiya, yahi vajah thi ki wo baad main parashuram kehalaae

 One New Delhi seat from where Kejriwal was contesting and another Krishnanagar from where BJP fielded Kiran Bedi as its CM candidate
 aaie peeche mudakar dekhen, un 10 baton kii ore
 Which made Delhi's riot interesting
 1
 Two friends face to face
 
 
 do purv afasar
 
 
 The first thing was that the election became Kiran Versus Kejriwal
 yah vahi do chehre the, jo chaar saal pehle anna andolan ke ek hi manch se ek hi baat karte the
 Of corruption
 raajnneetik dalon ko koste the or raajnneeti ko keechad bataate the
 But both changed their minds
 kejariwal do saal ke bheetar teen chunaav lade, to kiran bedi ko bijepi ne 20 din pehle na sirf chunaav maidan main lekar aayi, balki kejariwal ke mukaable siem pad kaa ummidavaar bhi bana diya
 Both had no background in politics and both came to the field of politics by traveling the bureaucracy (one IPS and one IRS) from the same exam (UPSC) background
 2
 Election Commission challenge, dogged efforts In this election, the Election Commission rules and notices were also used by Kejriwal as a weapon for campaigning
 arvind kejariwal ne ek nahin kai baar kaha, 'bijepi congress se paise lenaa or vot aam aadmi party ko hi dena' is bayaan kii shikaayat bhi hui or kai baar kejariwal ko notice bhi mili
 But the day the notice was received, Kejriwal would repeat his statement
 chunaav ayog ke dar ko chunauti dene kii is ranneeti se kejariwal ne khub surkhiyaan batori
 Ultimately, the Election Commission had to give strict instructions but also publicly condemned Kejriwal
 isi kaa doosraa namoona iviem par sawaal kaa he
 Kejriwal complained that press any button, the vote will be passed on to the BJP
 ye bayaan or shikaayak kejariwal tab tak karte rahe, jab tak chunaav ayog se sakht hidayad nahin mili
 The motive of the sources was that this publicity should be so much publicized that some voters should use it while casting votes at the polling booth and in this round, bjp's vote will be passed on to someone else
 3
 Every last four elections in Delhi were fought on the issue of electricity and water
 is baar bhi jor bijli half or pani maaf par hi tha
 But as soon as the election was announced, the issue of the entire election changed not only
 jis janalokapal ke mudde par pichhali sarkaar giri, uskaa zikr bhi shaayad hi mudde ke taur par hua ho
 This issue became just an allegation
 chunaav sirf chehron main simat gaya
 Kejriwal vs Modi was an election at some point, so the announcement of voting dates became modi-bedi
 4
 The noise of the elections in Delhi was widely heard on the streets, in the streets and in the neighborhoods
 lekin asli ladaai akhabaaron or soshal media se ladi gai
 Although advertisements are given in newspapers every time, but this time newspaper advertisements have become an issue
 vigyapanon kii ladaai cricket ke 20-20 match se kam romaanchak nahin rahi

 pehali baar congress ne tisare number kii ladaai ladi
 
 
 This is the first time in a Hindi-speaking state that the Congress has fought for the third position
 congress sanghathan ne khud ko chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke pehle se hi bijepi or aap ke saamne sarender maan liya tha
 This is the reason that for the first time in the country, a party that has imposed a hat-trick of power in a state is suddenly out of the competition
 isse bhi zyada dilachasp ye rahaa ki jo shila dikshit 15 saalon tak dilli kii mukhyamantri raheen, wo chunaav main cheharaa dikhaane kii rasm adaayagi bhar ke liye ain
 7
 pradhanmantri kii apil mukhyamantri kii tarahyah baat bhi kam dilachasp nahin he ki ek pradhanmantri kisi rajya ke mukhyamantri kii tarah apil karata dikhaa ho
 The BJP first decided to contest the election by keeping Modi's face in front, then made Kiran Bedi the CM candidate
 baavjood iske jab dilli waalon se vot maangane kii baat ai to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane hi naam par vot dene kii apil kii

 pehali baar 25 dinon main hua chunaav
 
 
 This time Delhi's election was completed in just 25 days, compared to months of electoral efforts

 The comments lekin jab baccha lagaataar rota hi rahaa to trump ne apana iraadaa badal diya or mahila ko vahaan se jane ko kah diya
 He said, 'I was only joking, you can take the child out of here
 ’ bachche kii pareshaan maa ke liye unhone kaha, ‘koi baat nahin

 His mother was wandering around him like that - don't worry about it

 Saying this, Trump continued his speech on the devaluation of China and its currency
 tippaniyan But when the child kept crying constantly, Trump changed his mind and asked the woman to leave
 unhone kaha, ‘main keval majaak kar rahaa tha, aap bachche ko yahaan se baahar le ja sakati hai
 To the troubled mother of the child, he said, 'it doesn't matter
 mujhe lagata he ki unhone meri is baat par vishwaas kar liya ki mere bolne ke dauraan bachche kaa ronaa mujhe pasand aata he
 It doesn't matter if people don't understand

 In order to prevent Narendra Modi from coming back to power in the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has sealed the alliance model of TMC chief Mamata Banerjee
 kejariwal ne kaha ki modi ko agar haraana chaahate hai to sabhi milakar ek ko samarthan karen, agar aisa nahin hota he to phir bijepi ko haraana mushkil he
 Kejriwal said that in UP, the SP-BSP has formed an alliance, in such a situation, if the third party also enters the election then the BJP will win easily
 aise main jis soobe main jo sabase majboot he, vipaksh ke sabhi dal use samarthan karen
 Kejriwal has stamped the formula aligned with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 darasal, mamata pehle se hi kahati rahi hai ki jis rajya main jo dal majboot he use sabhi samarthan karen
 Mamta gave a one-to-one fight formula for 2019
 mamata ne vipakshi dalon ke tamaam netaaon ke saath mulaakaat kar unhen ekajute karne kii kavayad kaaphi pehle se kar rahi thi
 Mamta met UPA President Sonia Gandhi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi regarding the one-to-one fight formula
 mamata ke formul ke lihaaj jo party jahaan majboot he, vahaan usko damadari se ladanaa chahie
 Mamta had said after meeting Sonia that we want Congress to help regional parties to compete with BJP
 yah aamane-saamne kii ladaai hi bhartiya janata party ko khatm karegi
 However, the Congress did not agree on Mamata's one-to-one fight formula
 dilli main arvind keservil ne mamata banerjee ke formule ke tahat akele sabhi saaton siton par chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya he
 But Congress has also spoken about contesting all the seats
 is tarah se pashchim bengal main mamata sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kii baat kar rahi hai or congress bhi

 supreme court main teen jaj niyukt hone ke maamle main utraakhand hoicourt ke chif justise ke em joseph ke varishthata ke kram main tisare number par hone kaa maamla phir charchaa main he
 Regarding this, according to the sources of the central government, the preference has been decided on the basis of who became the first high court judge and not on the basis of who became the chief justice of the first three judges
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar kaa kahana he ki justise indira banerjee 5 farvari 2002, justise vineet saran 14 farvari 2002 or justise ke em joseph 14 oktober 2014 ko hai court ke jaj bane
 In fact, in the case of three judges appointed in the Supreme Court, Uttarakhand High Court Chief Justice KM Joseph met the Supreme Court judge Chief Justice Deepak Mishra, who was angry at being ranked third in the order of seniority
 in jajon kaa kahana he ki justise joseph ko supreme court main jaj banane ke liye collegium ne sabase pehle janvari main sifarish bheji thi lekin centre ne april main ise waapas bhej diya
 If the collegium sent the recommendation of Justice Joseph's name again, now Justice Joseph has been placed at number three after Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Vineet Saran, making them both junior
 jabaki wo inase pehle hai court ke chif justise bane the
 According to the rule, if many judges take oath on the same day, then the order of their swearing becomes the basis of seniority
 justise deepak mishra or justise jasti chalameshwar ke bich tanatani kii asli vajah hi yahi thi
 Justice Chalmeswar was sworn in just three minutes before Justice Deepak Mishra and became a junior forever
 is shuukravaar ko box offis par relies hui film 'dilavaale' or 'bajirao mastaani' ke bich takkar dekhi ja rahi he
 Although the collection of 'dilwale' is bigger than 'bajirao Mastani', this period film of Sanjay Leela Bhansali is also doing good business
 'dilavaale' ne box offis par acchhee opening hasil kii or red chillij ke mutabik 'dilavaale' ne pehle din kareeb 21 karod kaa collection kiya
 On the other hand, the film 'bajirao Mastani' was also seen by many viewers on the first day and it earned 12 on the first day
 80 karod kii hui
 Shahrukh Khan's film 'dilwale' got a place in about 60% of the cinema houses of the country, while Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'bajirao Mastani' got 40% of the cinema houses, so the revenue sharing was already being speculated, which Is proving true agar ye donon filmein alag-alag aatin to jaahir he ki donon hi filmon ko zyada cinema ghar milte or darshak nahin bantate
 The comments filmon ke jaankaar or trade pandit vikaas mohan ne kaha, "dilavaale ko 'bajirao mastaani' se badi opening or badi kamai kerani laazmi thi, kyonki shahrukh kaa staradam bada he, duusari taraf 'dilavaale' ko zyada cinemaghar bhi mili hai or tikat kii keemat bhi badi he
 The two films should not have come together, as both films are at a disadvantage
 bijness main kabhi igo nahin laana chahie

 If these two films came separately then obviously both films would get more cinema houses and the audience would not be divided
 tippaniyan Film expert and trade pundit Vikas Mohan said, "dilwale had a big opening and big bucks from 'bajirao Mastani', because Shah Rukh's stardom is bigger, on the other hand, 'dilwale' has got more theaters and the ticket price Has also increased
 donon filmon ko ek saath nahin aani chahie thi, kyonki nuksaan donon hi filmon kaa he

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 
 
 
 To prevent this anniversary of the Kedarnath tragedy, Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti has said that in the memory of the people killed in the Kedarnath tragedy on June 17, tree planting will be done at select places from Gangotri to Gangasagar
 nadiyon ke udgam sthal par medicated plant yani aushadhiy gun vaali vanaspati lagaai jaaegi
 Uma Bharti also said that the central government will put warning systems in those lakes on the mountains, which are 50 hectares and above
 nadiyon ke taton ko surakshit banane ke liye paryaavaran or payrton mantralay kii madad lee jaaegi
 Uma Bharti said that rivers are not monuments
 iske nirantar pravaah kii raksha janata hi kar sakati he
 All this is fine and not ritual, but to understand the tragedy of Uttarakhand, you also have to understand the politics and lack of coordination between central and state level agencies
 aap jaanate hai ki 17 june 2013 kii traasadee ke baad alaknanda, mandakini, bhagirathi, pinder, kaliganga, dhauli samet kai nadiyon main achaanak baadh aa gai
 The state government says that more than four thousand people were killed and about fifteen hundred were missing, while the National Disaster Management Authority reported the number of dead at close to ten thousand


 Non-official figures are giving more to this number
 ye tabaahi kyon ai? prakritik, raajnneetik jise maanviya kaha jaataa he or kya daivi kaaran rahe
 Uma Bharti had then said that displacement of the idol of Dhari Devi has brought disaster
 jab baandh nirmaan ke kaaran dhari devi ko visthapit kiya ja rahaa tha, tab 2012 main is masale ko lekar adwani sahit bijepi ke kai netaa raashtrapati se mili the
 Now i do not know whether such opinion is there or not
 philhal yah sawaal uth saktaa he ki baandhon yaa nadiyon ko lekar unki kya koi nai raay banane ja rahi he
 In a report published in the Hindu newspaper, Uma Bharti had said that if the power plans are made on the Ganges or other rivers with the opinion of experts, then there is no problem
 vikaas ke liye bijli jaruri he or yah nadiyon kii kshamta ke dohan se paidaa ho sakati he
 But after completing the 3000 km journey of Ganga, Uma ji's statement changes and she says about the continuous stream
 ganga samgr yatra ke baad vah apana rukh saaf karti hai ki ve baandh yaa vikaas ke khilaaf nahin he, lekin vikaas ke naam par nadiyon ko barbaad nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Then this year came his statement that the tributaries of Ganga are being ruined due to dams in Uttarakhand
 sarkaron kii galat yojana or ganga ke prati kam shraddha ke kaaran
 The ecology of the Himalayas is being damaged
 in tamaam sarkari yojanaon ke nafe nuksaan kaa adhyayan karne ke liye vah ek cameti banaaengi
 Sometimes in the development journey of Uma Bharti's statements about the dam, sometimes there is one thing that he is concerned about the rivers and mountains and these decisions can be expected to be reflected in his decisions in the coming time
 , Because of the partial and complete destruction of 14 of the 70 dam projects going on in Uttarakhand due to the devastation of last year, the dams started to be debated again and all the world's great There were wide-ranging reports in journals such as Science, Nature, Current Science, etc
 in sab main baandh ek kaaman kaaran rahaa
 In August 2013, the Supreme Court also stayed the environmental clearance for any new hydroelectric project in Uttarakhand
 court ne alaknanda or bhagirathi ghaatiyon main 24 panbizli pariyojnaon ke paryaavaran par asar kaa adhyayan kaa aadesh diya
 Following this order, the environment ministry formed a panel of independent experts, according to which hydropower projects and the devastation that took place last year are closely linked
 report ke mutabik mandakini or alaknanda ghati main baandh nirmaan ke dauraan pahaado ko todane se paidaa hui mitti ne baari tabaahi machaai he
 The silt created during the construction of the dam in the Mandakini river from Kund to Tilwara and the soil from the raw banks of the rivers caused huge havoc with the flow of water
 vishnuprayag main ai tabaahi kii ek badi vajah vah bairaj rahaa, jisane tej raftaar se pani ke saath aa rahe malbe ko roka
 This mixed force of debris and water caused massive destruction in the surrounding area, breaking the barrage
 srinagar kii ghati main ai tabaahi se srinagar panbizli project ke adhikari nahin batch sakate
 These officials dumped millions of tons of silt along the river keeping all the rules in place during dam construction
 upar se teji ke saath ai nadi is gaad ko apane saath baha le gai or aage srinagar shahar ke nichle ilaakon par le jaakar use daal diya, jisaki vajah se vahaan bhayanak nuksaan hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is constantly talking of creating a Himalayan University to study the crises and possibilities of the Himalayas
 kya isi kii kami ke kaaran sankat gaharaata he yaa koi thos raajnneetik samaj nahin ban paati he
 There are many institutions in Nepal and India that are currently studying different aspects of the Himalayas
 international centre for integrated mountain deveopment- isimodi, himalay se jude sabhi pahaluon par samagrata se adhyayan karne vaala ye sabase bada santhaan kathmandu main he
 In India, the GB Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development is headquartered in Almora
 dehradun ke wadiya institute of himalayan jiyology main himalay ke bhugolic pahaluon kaa adhyayan hota he
 Chandigarh and Leh have snow and avalanche study installations
 chennai main glacier kii modelling par shodh ke liye institute of mathematical sciensej he
 Apart from this, there are many institutions: Indian Institute of Science, bengalooru National Geophysical Research Institute − NGRI, Hyderabad Indian Institute of Remote Sensing- IIRS, dehradun Indian Space Research Organization- ISRO Forest Research Institute− FRI, dehradun Geological Survey of India Botanical Survey of India Zoological Survey of India phir bhi aapako lage ki padhai likhaai yaa research ke maamle main kuch hota hi nahin, to aap is suchi main kuch or vishvavidhyalayon ke naam jod sakate hai jahaan adhyayan hota he- HNB Garhwal Central University Srinagar - Kumaon University Nainital Himachal University Shimla Jammu Central University Jammu Apart from this, there are many universities in North East states
 to himalay par adhyayan karne vaale sansthaanon kii kami nahin he
 Now i am not in a position to tell you what the government does while taking decisions or how much synergy is there between these institutions
 himalayan technalji university ban jaaegi to acha to he magar usase himalay kaise bachegaa
 The Himalayas will survive decisions that are taken politically in the name of development

 The BJP made a clear beginning to move away from being a brahmin-baniya party long before the 2014 elections
 masalan, 2004 tak party ne assam se lekar rajasthan tak saat rajyon main dalit or adivasee votaron ke bich apana acha-khaasaa samarthan kaayam kar liya tha
 In 2014, the BJP won 80 per cent of the seats in these seven states, which was twice its success rate outside these areas
 2009 ke chunaavon main obisi, party ke aadhaar main savarnon se bada hissaa ban gaye or yah rujhaan 2014 main bhi jari rahaa
 But even if 2014 is witness to the bjp's efforts to expand, it is not evidence that Hindutva has successfully ousted other forms of identity politics
 pehla, bhaajapa ne apane samarthan ko jahaan kai jatiyon main failaayaa he, vahiin uski lokapriyata bahut zyada bhugolic simaaon se ghiri hui he
 Three-fourths of bjp's seats have come from just seven out of 29 states, mostly in North and Central India
 desh ke dakshini or purvi hisson main party ne kshetreey partiyon ke mukaable apekshaakrit kharaab pradarshan kiya he
 Any attempt to understand the 2014 victory of the BJP must begin with accepting the party's geographical boundaries
 duusare, jin ilaakon main bhaajapa multah taqatvar he, vahaan bhi uske chunavi samarthan ko hindu rashtrawaad ke vaicharik samarthan ke baraabar nahin mana ja saktaa
 My own research showed that between 1996 and 2004, there were two types of upper caste people who supported Hindu nationalism, those who voted for the BJP and those who did not
 haalanki, dalit or adivasee samudaayon ke bheetar bhaajapa ke samarthak hindutv kaa samarthan karne waalon se alag nahin the
 Recent survey research shows that upper-caste supporters of the BJP are tied to Hindutva, while new party supporters often do not support the bjp's majoritarian rhetoric or are prone to prejudicial attitudes towards Muslims
 hindutv party ke nae samarthakon ko nahin lubhaata
 Third, to say that Hindutva has fundamentally changed caste-based politics into new forces, is to underline that the bjp's electoral success has often been attributed to using caste politics for its own benefit
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ne 2014 main 80 main se 71 siten jeetne or phir 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main baari bahumat jaisi jabardast kamyaabiyaan hasil kin
 a few years ago the party was in a difficult position in the state
 sapa ne musalamaanon or kai obisi samudaayon main janaadhar majboot kiya tha, jabaki basapa ne daliton ko lubhaaya
 The BJP set its eyes on making a dent in the support of marginalized castes within each of these coalitions
 party ne 2007 se hi gaiyr-yadavon or gaiyr-jatav daliton ko lubhaane kii koshishen kii hai
 These efforts paid off in 2014, when Lokniti data showed that the party garnered 60 per cent non-yadav OBC votes (compared to just 27 per cent Yadav votes) and 45 per cent non-jatav Dalit votes (compared to 18 per cent Jatav votes)
 Done
 bhaajapa ummid karti ai he ki hindutv uskesavarna aadhaar or gaiyr-kuleen bahusnkhyakon ke bich vaicharik ekajutata main eendhan kaa kaam karegaa
 But the limited appeal of Hindutva has reduced its electoral utility
 vah apane mul aadhaar or nae samarthakon ke bich santulan saadhane kii najuk kavayad main juty he
 In the elections of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, there was a significant decrease in the Dalit and tribal voters of the BJP
 agar 2014 kii hi tarah is baar bhi modi kii lokapriyata logon ke sar chadhakar bole to bhaajapa 2019 main dobaaraa jeet sakati he
 Yet from these results, we cannot decide that Hindutva has gone out of its caste dilemma
 bhaajapa kii kamyaabi or naakaamiyon ke lambey itihaas main haalia jeet ko rakhane par milane vaale sanket hamen iske janadesh ke galat akalan se saavdhaan karte hai

 unki kitaab elite parties, pier voters bharat main garib matadaataaon ke bich bhaajapa ke ubhaar kaa byoraa detii he*** BJP President Amit Shah arrived at the residence of Mirzapur, the leader of the Apna Dal and Union Minister Anupriya Patel, a partner of the NDA
 iske saath hi endie ke duusare sahyogiyon ko sandesh diya ki gathbandhan main sab kuch thik-thaak chal rahaa rahaa he
 In the future, this alliance will be strong, not weak
 maaloom ho ki amit shah saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari main abhi se jute gaye hai
 In this episode, he is constantly meeting the celebrities and allies of the country under the Sampark for Samarthan campaign
 uttar pradesh main apana dal bijepi kaa sabase bada sahyogi he
 Amit Shah had reached Anupriya Patel's house in Mirzapur to give this message how serious the BJP is with its ally
 is dauraan amit shah ke saath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or bijepi pradesh adhyaksh mahendra pandey bhi maujuud the
 These leaders also held a political discussion on tea at Anupriya Patel's house
 kareeb aadhe ghante kii mulaakaat ke baad jayeemit shahabahar nikle, to unhone sirf itnaa hi kaha ki yahaan chaay pi he, jo kaaphi acchhee lagi or jahaan tak raajnneeti charchaa kaa vishay he, to ye baaten hoti hi rahati hai
 Although Amit Shah had reached the Mirzapur expansion program, where he had to give important feedback on the election preparations to the 93 extensionists of Kashi, Awadh and Goraksh region, but from this visit, Shah also took another target and reached Anupriya Patel's house
 bijepi adhyaksh ne yogi sarkaar main sahyogi om prakaash rajbhar sareekhe sahyogi ko sandesh diya ki wo sanyamit or sanjide sahyogiyon kaa puraa khyaal rakhte hai
 At the same time, the door is also opened for other small parties
 amit shah pehle vindhyachal pahunchakar mata vindhyavasini ke darshan kiye or phir party kaaryakartaaon se mili
 After this, Shah reached Anupriya Patel's house directly
 is dauraan amit shah, yogi adityanath or mahendra pandey samet anya netaaon ne chunaav or gathbandhan par charchaa kii
 However, no leader said anything after exiting the meeting
 jab unako baar-baar kureda gaya, to sirf itnaa hi kaha ki anupriya patel ke ghar par chaay par hui yah mulaakaat shishtachar bhent thi
 However, Amit Shahki is deriving huge significance from this meeting
 anupriya patel ke baad ab 12 july ko amit shah patna main nitish se bhi mulaakaat kar sakate hai

 Alcohol prohibition is going to prove to be a big issue in Bihar in the coming elections
 kyonki rajya kii aadhi aabaadi yani ki mahilaayein nitish sarkaar ke is faisle se khush hai
 Also, most men also consider it to be the right decision
 lekin logon ko sharabbandi kanoon se thodi bahut dikkat bhi ho rahi he
 RJD wants to take advantage of this and make the laws of liquidity the only issue in elections
 argedy ise ab kaala kanoon maanati he
 However, when this law was enacted, the RJD was also included in the Nitish government
 sharabbandi ke kaale kanoon main badlaavargedy ke varisht netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ne kaha ki agar hamaari sarkaar banegi tobihar mensharabbandi to lagu hoga, lekin iske kaale kanoon ko ham badalenge
 In our law, people will not be forced into alcohol
 logon ko dauda-dauda kar pakadaa nahin jayega
 Neither will the house be seized upon receipt of the bottle
 naa hi das saal kii sajaa hogi
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that we will include it in our manifest
 sharabbandi par kadaa kanoonbihar main 1 april 2016 ko sharabbandi kaa lagu kiya gaya
 Then to implement it strictly, a new law was enacted on 1 October
 iske tahat yadi koi vyakti pakadaa jaataa he to us par kathor dand kaa praavdhaan banaaya jaataa he
 The law provided for confiscation of the house and punishment of 10 years for imprisoning someone
 is dauraan bahut sari gadiyon main sharaab milane ke baad use jabt kiya gaya
 Even the public bus was seized
 ek anumaan ke mutabik is dauraan 1 lakh se zyada log jail gaye
 Although many of them have been released on bail, the illegal liquor business continues
 mana ja rahaa tha ki kade kanoon se log darenge aursharab kii taskreemen kami aegi
 But this did not happen and the smuggling of alcohol continues unabated
 argedy rajya sarkaar ke isi kami ko bhunaane main lagi he, jiskaa sanketaargedike rashtriya upaadhyaksh raghuvansh prasad singh ne diya he
 It is not a matter of any party in Bihar to end liquor ban alone
 lekin kanoon ko kamjor kar is muhim ko bhi kamjor kiya ja saktaa he

 shanivaar ko hi rubi raay bihar vidhyalay pariksha samiti dwaara banaai gai ecport cameti ke saamne pesh hui thi
 So far Ruby Rai was ignoring the summons sent by the committee to appear
 rubi unki medha kii jaanch ke liye banaai gai visheshgyon kii samiti ke saamne pesh huin
 Experts found that she was unable to answer most of the questions
 is aadhaar par unka purv kaa rigelt radd kar diya gaya
 The police arrested him from the premises of the board office
 gauratlab he ki rubi raay is saal kii baravin (arts) kii pariksha kii topper ghoshit hui thi or uske intervyuu ke baad hi maamle kaa khulaasa hua or jaanch shuru hui

 ek jo pariksha main dhaandhlee ko anjaam dekar paas karne kaa or phir first divizan or top karaane kaa dhandha tha
 Apart from this, there was a case of affiliation of colleges in which Lalkaswar and his wife, through their relatives and brokers, spent crores of rupees in the last few years

 But i am not going anywhere now

 Showing strict attitude on this, the Election Commission has filed a complaint with the Delhi Police
 chunaav ayog ne police se aise phek news failaane waalon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii maang kii he
 It is worth noting that three-four days ago, on many social media platforms including whatsapp group, Facebook, it was reported that the schedule of Lok Sabha elections has gone viral
 is khabar main har rajya ke byore ke saath bataaya gaya tha ki april or may ke bich puure desh main chunaav sampann hone hai
 It said that the election will begin on April 7 and will conclude on May 17
 chunaav ayog dwaara phek news ke khilaaf karrwai kaa sambhavat: yah pehla vakya he

 But the Election Commission has the full authority to determine the date of election
 isaki taiyaari kaaphi gopneey hoti he or iske bare main pehle kisi ko bhanak nahin lag sakati
 It is announced by the Chief Election Commissioner himself and the notification comes into force only after the date is announced

 1
 Whether she considers Burhan Vani as terrorist or not? 2
 afjal guru ko aatankwaadi maanati hai yaa nahin?3
 Soldiers in Kashmir are being martyred by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai, Mehbooba Mufti will say Bharat Mata Ki Jai or not

 Why is the BJP sitting on its lap giving shelter to terrorists? Mohan Bhagwat will also agree with these questions
 kal ek jawan shahid ho gaya or mahabuuba mufti kahengi kii bharat mata kii jai nahin boluungi
 Will we keep such people on the chair? Did BJP give the right to raise slogans in support of Afzal Guru? CM Mehbooba Mufti became emotional after Kapil Mishra's statement
 is par kapil ne tevar ke saath kaha ki "mahabuuba mufti kyon ro rahi hai? hindustan kii mata roti hai jab shahid hoti hai
 Cry a thousand like Mehbooba Mufti

 The BJP, who put Mehbooba Mufti on the chair, also cried
 maine to manch se bolaa he ki kabhi mahabuuba mufti ke saath manch share nahin karnaa chahta hoon isliye main manch se utar gaya
 It is a shame for me that the Mufti, who does not consider terrorists as terrorists, is sitting there on a chair
 jabaki unke saath jo satta share kar rahe hai unhen shame aani chahie
 "kapil Mishra alleged that PDP is a supporter of terrorists and the Mufti family has started terrorism in the country
 kapil ne kaha ki "mere dil main barason se ye sawaal he mufti parivaar ke bare main
 Mehbooba Mufti says loudly, Bharat Mata ki Jai, all questions will be over
 lekin mahabuuba mufti, pidipi aatankwaadiyon kaa samarthan karte hai

 The gwalior-chambal region of Madhya Pradesh is known for its rich milk and ghee production
 yahaan se ye utpaada deshbhar main bheje jate hai
 But recently, the milk business of the area business was discounted when the Sai Baba Mandir Trust of Shirdi found Ghee of Gwalior's Gambal producer company Chambal Dairy Products adulterated and banned the company
 company ne mandir ko 5,000 ton se zyada ghi supplai kiya tha
 The temple trust had been receiving complaints of bitterness in Prasad for a long time
 jinhen gambhirtha se lete hue usne maharashtra kii sarkari prayogshaala main laddu banane ke istemaal main aane vaali sabhi samagriyon kii jaanch karwaai
 It was found that palm oil has been added to the ghee
 mandir main chambal deyari product ke madhuratn brands kaa ghi istemaal hota tha
 Complaint of adulteration was made with Gwalior administration
 usne bhi namoonon main milawat pai
 This was a major revelation of the large scale adulteration of ghee being made in the region
 company kii factory par chapa maaraa gaya to vahaan se pom oil sahit milawat kii or bhi chijen milin
 The administration then registered a case under the National Security Act (NSA) against the company's owner Shivkumar Goyal
 takneekee drushti se ghi kii shuddhta do paimaanon aaram vailu (26 ötishat) or biraar vailu (40-44) par aanki jaati he
 This different rating means adulteration
 khaadya adhikari akhilesh gangwal bataate hai, ''madhuratn ghi kii aaramem vailu 24 or biaar vailu 44 se zyada thi
 It is not surprising that milk production in the area is same, but the production of ghee is increasing
 yahaan har roj 60,000 litre doodh kaa utpaadan hota he
 Out of this, only 15,000 liters of milk is used to make ghee
 ek litre doodh se sirf 6 fisadi ghi nikal paata he
 That is, a maximum of one ton (1,000 kg) of ghee can be made in a day, while according to estimates, eight tons (8,000 kg) of ghee is being sent to other states daily
 ghi kii maatra badhaane ke liye companiyaan isamen tel or essence mila detii hai jisase shudgh or milavati ghi main antar karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Adulteration of animal fat has also been found in ghee made in the area
 charbi kii aaram vailu 40 hoti he, yah dikhti bhi ghi jaisi hi he
 People involved in the business of fake ghee say that up to 40 per cent of fat is added to one kg of ghee
 nakli ghi banane kii laagat 100 se 150 ru
 Per liter while in the market it is Rs 350 to 400
 litre tak bikta he
 This greed for profit is taking hold of the ghee business of the area
 logon kii sehat ke saath khilwaad kar rahe nakli ghi ke kaarobaariyon ke khilaaf shashan ne lambey samay baad itnaa sakht rukh apanaaya he
 Collector of Gwalior P
 narhari bataate hai, ''hamane bahut sakhti kii he
 Along with sending samples for testing, the goods were also prevented from reaching the market
 pehle jaanch jari rahane ke dauraan nakli ghi bazaar main khap jaataa tha
 Action is being taken under the NSA to create fear in fake ghee traders
 milawat rokane ke liye prashasan kii ore se oparation vishuddh bhi chalaaya ja rahaa he
 "fake ghee business is still inside the government machinery
 sutron kii maane to khaadya padaarthon main milawat rokane ke liye jimmedaar khaadya or aushadhi vibhaag ke adhikariyon tak nakli ghi ke kaarobaari niyamit hissaa pahunchaate hai
 That is why many times the sample of fake ghee is changed by reaching laboratory and court
 gwalior-chambal sambhag ke liye sweekrut food inspector ke 20 padon main se aadha darjan khaali pade hai
 This is one of the reasons why this business is not being controlled
 ghi kii maatra, sugandh or gaadhaapan badhaane ke liye jo chijen milaai jaati hai ve sehat ke liye behad ghaatak hai

 Dinesh Rao, who arrived in Delhi on Saturday to form an election strategy with Congress President Rahul Gandhi, said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak, 'who is BJP, who is Hindu? Is BJP the protector of Hinduism? Along with being anti-hindu on BJP BJP insulting Hindus, the Congress leader also said that we are all Hindus and BJP is insulting Hindus of Congress and other parties
 bijepi hindu virdohi kisi hui, is sawaal par congress netaa ne jawaab diya ki 'bijepi hindu virdohi isliye he kyonki wo daawa karte hai ki agar aap hindu hai to aapako bijepi main hona chahie, jo apane aap main hindu virdohi bayaan he
 The Congress state president further said, "we do not believe in hard line and do not follow the policy of hate
 ham hindu virdohi nahin hai

 These days there are reports of fake currency coming out of atms of all banks
 aapako yah jaanakar hairat hogi ki note dene vaali mashiinon main aisi koi divaais hi nahin lagi hoti, jisase in mashiinon tak aae nakli noton ko pakadaa ja sake
 There is also no provision to exchange fake notes originating from atms
 desh main november 2016 main 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane note amaanya kiye jane ke baad 500 or 2000 rupee ke note bazaar main chalan main aae hai
 Large flaws are also coming in these new notes, on one hand the consumer is upset due to technical lapses and on the other hand fake notes have come in the market
 iske alaava bainkon kii atm mashiinon se chuuran pudiya vaala note, nakli va bina number vaale noton ke nikalne kaa silsilaa jari he
 Chandrasekhar Gaur, a right to information activist in Neemuch district of Madhya Pradesh, had sought details from the Reserve Bank of India regarding fake notes emanating from ATM machines before demonetisation
 arabiai ke mudra prabandh vibhaag ke note vinimay or jaali note satarkta prabhag ne jo byora diya, vah chaunkaane vaala he
 According to this statement, notes worth Rs 100 or more are inserted into the machine only when they are tested with a banknote machine
 noton ke asli or prachlan yogya hone par hi mashiinon main daalaa jaataa he
 RBI further stated in its reply that there is no instruction from the RBI regarding the fake note detector in ATM machines
 goud ne arabiai se poocha tha ki agar atm se nakli note nikalataa he to use kaise badalawaaya ja saktaa he? is par arabiai kaa jawaab he ki 'jaali note kaa koi mulya nahin hota, isliye uskaa vinimay nahin ho saktaa
 After the rbi's response to fake notes emanating from atms, Gaur urged the Public Gravins Cell of the Prime Minister's Office to issue instructions to the RBI that when consumers accept banknotes after the bank checks the origin of the note If you go, the ATM machine should have such a detector, so that the consumer also has the satisfaction that the note he is getting from the machine is actually Is
 piemosivi ne ek oktober, 2016 ko goud ke suzav ko darj kar aage badhaane kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 Gaur said that he had requested the PMOGV to install a device to catch fake notes in ATM machines, but it has not been implemented yet
 sawaal uthta he ki bank to jaanch parakhkar upabhokta se note letaa he, magar upabhokta ko atm se note nikaalte vakt yah adhikaar praapt nahin he
 In the midst of banking reforms initiative, RBI should upgrade the ATM machine and install detector device, so that the consumer can be saved from the trouble
 Fairly lucky to get to watch these 2 up close every game

 Pakistan's former lieutenant general Shahid Aziz, while dismissing Pakistan's official claims regarding the Kargil war in 1999, has said that the Mujahideen, not regular Mujahideen soldiers, took part in that 'meaningless' battle, and that The whole truth about the war is yet to come out

 The comments shahid ajij ne pakistan ke tatkaaleen senapramukh general parvej musharraf par is sambandh main lipapoti karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 The Lieutenant General wrote in an article in 'the Nation Daily' earlier this month, there was no Mujahideen, only taped wireless messages that could not fool anyone
 hamaare sainikon ko apane hathiyaaron or aagneyastron ke saath khaali padi pahadiyon par jane ko kaha gaya
 Aziz, who retired as Lahore's Corps Commander in 2005, wrote in an article titled 'putting Our Children in Line of Fire', the whole truth about Kargil is yet to come out
 ham abhi bhi un bhuule-bisare bhukh se nidhaal, kadakadaati thand main pahadiyon ke peeche chhipe, haathon main khaali bandooken liye marane vaale sainikon kii kahaniyon kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 
 
 That precious blood was shed without reason
 unhone kaha ki jo bhi thodi sachai vah jaanate hai, use baahar aane main bahut vakt laga, kyonki general parvej musharraf ne kargil kii sachai ko dabaa rakhaa tha
 Shahid Aziz also accused Pakistan's then army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, for dabbling in this regard
 leftinent general ne is maheene ke aarambh main 'da nesan daily' main apane ek lekh main likhaa, vahaan koi mujahidin nahin tha, sirf tepe kiye gaye wireles sandesh the, jo kisi ko bevakoof nahin bana sake

 He said that whatever little truth he knew, it took a long time to come out, because General Pervez Musharraf suppressed the truth of Kargil
