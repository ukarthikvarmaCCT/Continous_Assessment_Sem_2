 According to the statistics, there are about 35 lakh people all over the country who are not aware that they have hepatitis-c germs
 ek study main is baat kii pushti kii gai he
 Hepatitis is considered a major cause of liver diseases
 iskaa ilaaj agar samay par nahin karavaaya jaae to yah beemaari liver cancer kaa rup le sakati he
 Health experts say that science has made great progress in the last few years, due to which treatment of Hepatitis c has become possible
 is beemaari ke 8 se 12 saptaah ke dauraan bhi lagbhag 90 fisadi logon main iskaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 However, many misconceptions about the disease are also prevalent, due to which sometimes treatment is not started
 ye bhi mana jaataa he ki hepatitis kaa kaaran jaundice hota he
 These 5 major damage to the body due to not having breakfast, said the health expert, Hepatitis or jaundice disease does not spread due to dirty drinking water
 balki jab khun ke dwaara keetanu jigar main pahunchate hai, tab hoti he
 But by timely vaccination, the disease can be controlled

 iske alaava kuch logon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki hepatitis peedit mahilaon ko apane bacchon ko stanpan nahin karana chahie kyonki isse bachche main keetanu pahunch sakate hai
 But scientists have denied this

 yuvaraj, dhoni, jadhav score karne main fail rahe
 Will the Giants be able to run till 2019? The most senior players in the team right now are former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh
 viraat kohli hi yuvaraj ko team main vaapis lekar aae the, unhone aane ke baad kuch maichon main acha pradarshan bhi kiya
 But Yuvi is not able to perform consistently, while his fitness is also not good
 jiskaa asar unki fielding par bhi dikhataa he
 After the crushing defeat, Team India had a great game sense, ICC also saluted
 If we talk about Mahendra Singh Dhoni, his batting is very low
 lekin agar ballebaaji aati he to vah score karne main naakaam rahete hai
 Dhoni's contribution to the team is more visible as a wicketkeeper, but only on his own, he is worth staying in the team till 2019
 videsh main aswin ko hota kya he?ravichandran aswin maujuuda samay main bharat ke number 1 spinner hai
 But his good performance is always good in the country
 videshi pichon par aswin kisi saadhaaran spinner kii tarah hi dikhte hai
 They had the same condition in the Champions Trophy as well, in the final, Ashwin could not do anything special
 kohli ko yaad rakhana hoga ki vishwacap bhi england main hi hona he
 When the entire team failed, these two players were standing proudly! Will have to be tough like Dhoni! If Virat Kohli dreams of winning 2019 World Cup, he will have to take a tough stand like former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 aapako yaad hoga ki dhoni ne vishwacap kii taiyaari karne ke liye apni team banane par dhyaan diya tha, kai maukon par unhone sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir jaise khilaadiyon kii drop bhi kar diya tha
 At the same time, in the 2013 Champions Trophy, Dhoni reached England with his youth team and won the title on his own
 PAK ke khilaaf team india kii is haar ne 2003 vishwacap final kii yaad dilaa di

 Amitabh Bachchan and Varun Dhawan can be seen together in director Pradeep Sarkar's film
 sutron ke anusaar, yashraj binar tale ban rahi film 'dabba gul' ke liye amitabh ne hami bhar di he
 At the same time, talks are going on with Varun and it is expected that the answer will be yes
 varun, amitabh ke bahut bade fain hai or bachchan parivaar ke saath unke gharelu rishte bhi hai
 Amitabh along with Varun's father director David Dhawan, have done two films 'bade Miya Chhoti Mian' and 'hum Kisi Ke Kamal Nahin'
 nirdeshak pradeep sarkaar isse pehle yashraj binar ke lierani mukherjeestarar 'mardaani' bana chuke hai
 Keeping in mind the new generation and the old generation, the pairing of Varun and Amitabh would be a great casting
 acting ke kshetra meshmitabh bachchanis vakt har kism kaa experiment kar rahe hai
 His film 'pink' is going to be released soon in which he is playing the role of a lawyer
 yashraj kii hi ek or film 'thag' ke liye bhi unhone hami bhar di he
 Now it will be interesting to see how he entertains the audience with 'dabba Gul'
 canada or bharat ke rishte hameshaa hi uljhe rahe hai
 No matter how surprised this is, but this is the reality
 aazaadee ke baad bharat kii canada se dosti mote taur par naagarik parmaanu takanic ke aayaat or vikaas aarthik madad tak hi simit rahi
 However, after India's nuclear test in 1974, Canada severed ties citing the promise of its energy treaty
 usne parmaanu takneekee kii aapurti band kar di
 Sourness was further compounded in the eighth decade when Canada was granted asylum and open leeway to Sikh militant groups active for Khalistan, who wanted to wage war against India
 isse bharat kii naaraazgi badi
 The bitterness increased in 1985 when an Air India Kanishka flight coming from Montreal via London to New Delhi exploded and killed all 329 people on board
 canada ko yah kabool karne main 25 saal lag gaye ki uski police or suraksha balon kii kotahi se bam kii rokthaam nahin ho saki
 Relations improved briefly in the nineties, but after India's nuclear tests in 1998, Canada imposed economic sanctions
 aakhir 37 saal baad kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri (dow
 Manmohan Singh) made a bilateral visit to Canada
 uske pehle 1973 main indira gandhi vahaan gai thim
 By then, the tension between the two issues of dispute - nuclear and Sikh separatism - had reduced considerably
 bharat ke america se parmaanu qaraar or parmaanu aapurti samooh (enesji) se hasil chhot ke baad canada aakhirkaar jhukaa or usne 2010 main bharat ke parmaanu bijli sanyantron ke liye uranium aapurti ke samjhaute par dastakhat kiye
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Ottawa in April 2015, his warm-up relationship with the then Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper warmed the relationship between the two countries and escalated to a "strategic partnership"
 sirf bharat ko parmaanu eendhan kii aapurti kii do sandhiyaan hi phir se sakriy nahin kii gayi, balki antariksh takanic, naagarik uddyan, railway, swasthya or biotechnology jaise kai kshetron main sahmati-patr (emoyu) par dastakhat hue
 It seemed that the indo-canadian relationship finally rose and was on the way to growth
 lekin yah chhalaava hi sabit hua
 Justin Trudeau won by defeating Harper by a large margin in the October 2015 general election and Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate him
 pradhanmantri ne unhen bharat daure ke liye nyauta diya
 When Prime Minister Trudeau made liberalism, multiculturalism and feminism a mark of his pride, his image became increasingly rockstar-like around the world
 unki cabinet main vividh samoohon or stri-purush samanta kaa pratinidhitiv sarvaadhik he
 He also proudly said that there are more Sikhs in his cabinet than the Modi government
 haalanki trudo ke baad ke kai pahal se rishton kii garmjoshi jaati rahi or bharat-canada sambandhon par unki chaaya padane lagi
 The Modi government began to express concern against India's interests over their friendly with the fanatical Sikh groups
 trudo ko bhartiya mul ke pravaasiyon khaskar canadai sikhon ko lubhaane kii darkaar he lekin bharat ko lagata he ki ve uski chintaaon ke prati asamvedansheel hai
 The relationship widened when the Assembly of Ontario Province passed a resolution calling the 1984 anti-sikh riots a "genocide"
 videshi rajdhaniyon main vaishvik sammelnon ke dauraan narendra modi or trudo yun to teen baar mil chuke hai, lekin canadai pradhanmantri satta main aane ke do saal baad bhi bharat ke daure par nahin aae hai
 It could not be ignored in the diplomatic corridors that Trudeau had visited China twice during this period
 vaise, unhone apane cabinet mantriyon ko lagaataar bharat bheja
 11 Canadian ministers have visited India after he came to power
 lekin bharose kaa sankat bana hua he
 So when Trudeau is finally visiting India on 17 February, the expectation is that the distance will decrease and the relationship between the world's second largest country and the world's largest democracy will melt in terms of area
 trudo hafte bhar bharat main rahenge
 In addition to a bilateral interaction with the Prime Minister in Delhi, the Canadian Prime Minister will meet businessmen in Mumbai
 ve agra, amritsar ke swarna mandir or ahmedabad main akshardham mandir main bhi jaaenge
 Modi and Trudeau can form bridges of relationship in many respects, especially as Vishnu Prakash, the Indian High Commissioner to Canada, called 3E, Economy, Energy and Education (economy, Energy and Education)
 haalanki dwipaksheeya vyapaar mahaj 6
 It is worth 5 billion dollars (india accounts for only 2 percent of Canada's world trade)
 canada se aayaat hone vaali chizon main dalhan, matar, potash or parmaanu eendhan hi pramukh hai
 India mainly exports gems, jewelery, pharma products, clothing and chemical fertilizers

 Last year, 1,24,000 students went
 ye beshak sakaaratmak ghatnaayen hai lekin donon deshon main abhi bhi ek duusare ko dene ke liye bahut kuch he
 India's current High Commissioner, Vikas Swaroop, says, "we see Canada as one of India's strongest partners
" "nai dilli main canada ke ucchayukta nadir patel kehete hai ki canada bharat ko mahatvapurn bazaar kii tarah dekhtaa he
 Both sides are negotiating the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Treaty (CEPA) and the Foreign Investment Promotion and Security Treaty (FIPA), but they are unlikely to take off during Trudeau's visit
 asli maamla to donon deshon ke bich bharosa bahaali hi he
 "canada is strong because of our differences, not in spite of them," Trudeau says proudly
 " bharat ke saath apane desh ke rishton main unhen sabit karnaa chahie ki matbhedon ke baavjood rishte majboot honge
 His first visit to India could accelerate this process

 In the controversy between Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli, former Team India captain Sunil Gavaskar has said that if the likes and dislikes of the captain matter so much then what is the work of the Cricket Advisory Committee
 darasal, bisisiai kii cricket salaahkaar samiti main sachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli or vivies lakshmana hai or inhen par jimmedaari he team ke nae coach chunane kii
 Stubborn Kohli did not even listen to the CAC During the Champions Trophy in Baalalandan, the Cricket Advisory Committee met Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble separately
 teenon ne yah suzav diya ki anil kumble ko hi team kaa coach banaaya jaae, par in teenon kii baat ko viraat kohli ne nakaar diya
 If the captain's wish will work then what is the need of CAC? Sunil Gavaskar was very angry on this matter
 gavaskar ne saaf kiya ki jab team ke khilaadi or captain kii pasand se hi coach chunaa janaa he to phir is salaahkaar samiti kii kya zarurat
 Ask the players in the West Indies directly and whom they want
 isse kaaphi logon kaa samay bachegaa
 Significantly, ever since this issue has come up, Sunil Gavaskar has given a statement in favor of Anil Kumble
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki viraat kohli ko bhi bayaan dekar sab kuch saaf kar dena chahie
 What scolded Team India? It is overwhelming to Kumble that after the embarrassing defeat of 180 runs against Pakistan, Team India captain Virat Kohli praised Pakistan fiercely but Kumble took a tough class after the match
 khabaron ke mutabik anil kumble ne team ke kai khilaadiyon ko khub daant lagaai or kaha ki har kisi kaa khel final main ummid se kam str kaa tha
 It is believed that this became the final reason for Kumble's departure
 khilaadiyon ko nahin tha haar kaa gamkumble ko is baat se or gussa aayaa ki match ke baad khilaadiyon ke chehre par haar kaa gam bilkul bhi nahin tha or vah maidan par pakistan ke khilaadiyon ke saath hansi majaak kar rahe the
 Anil Kumble put a lot of team bowlers in the dressing room and told him that such a performance will not work to stay in the team
 kumble kii ye kadavi baaten captain viraat kohli ko pasand nahin ain, kyonki kohli kaa maananaa tha ki khiladiyon ne koshish to puri kii thi par us din pakistan kii team har lihaaj se behatar thi
 But Kumble was not ready to accept Kohli's argument
 kohli ne kehane par BCCI ne kumble ko di jaankareeis jhagade ne kohli-kumble vivaad main taabut main aakhri keel kaa kaam kiya
 The next day when Kumble met BCCI officials, Kumble was made clear that Kohli no longer wanted him as the coach of the team
 kumble ne usee samay team ke coach pad se istipha dene kaa man bana liya

 This announcement was made in the bjp's resolution letter released on Tuesday
 iske baad buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maharashtra ke akola main raily ko sambodhit karte hue vir saavarkar ko yaad kiya, saath hi saavarkar ke sanskaron kii tarif karte hue vipaksh par unke apmaan kaa aarope lagaaya
 PM Modi, in his address, recalled Veer Savarkar while talking about the courage of taking a decision like removing Article 370 from Kashmir
 piem modi ne kaha, 'ye vir saavarkar ke hi sanskaar hai jo rashtrawaad ko hamane raashtra nirmaan ke mul main rakhaa he
 PM Narendra Modi, while speaking about the rites of Veer Savarkar, also surrounded the Congress governments
 piem modi ne kaha ki ek taraf saavarkar ke sanskaar hai or duusari taraf aise log hai jinhone baba sahab ambedkar kaa kadam-kadam par apmaan kiya he, unhen bharat ratna se vanchit rakhaa he

 bihar main pradhanmantri ke dream project ujjwala yojana ko jhatka lag rahaa he
 The government has given the distribution rights to new gas agencies to ensure supply in a short time under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, so that the Ujjwala scheme is also successful, as well as providing employment to the educated unemployed, but it is reversing in Bihar 
 nae-nae bane alpiji gas ke vitarak bhukhmaree kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to give LPG gas agency to employ educated unemployed is dying due to monopoly of old gas agencies and collusion of officials of gas supply companies
 bihar main 672 nae gas vitarak bhukhmaree ke shikaar ho rahe hai, lekin petroleum mantralay se mil rahe baar-baar nirdesh ke baavjood yahaan ke adhikari kaan main tel daalkar baithe hai
 For the last eight months, these agencies have got the right to distribute gas, but they do not have a single customer, in which case they should give gas
 gas agency lene main inhen 40 lakh rupee security ke rup main dene pade hai
 Apart from this, they have to pay the cost of gas godown and staff from their home, while there are about 400 old gas distributors in Bihar, they have 40 to 50 thousand consumers
 niyam ke mutabik, ek agency ke paas shahar main 8800 or gramin ilaakon main 5000 se zyada kanjumar nahin hone chahie
 Consumers of these old gas distributors were to be transferred to new distributors, but this has not been possible so far because of the bond between the executives of petroleum companies and the old gas distributors
 ministry of petroleum and natural gas ne 22 may 2019 ko yah spasht nirdesh jari kar upabhoktaaon ko nae gas agency main transfar karne kaa nirdesh diya tha, lekin is disha main bihar main koi kaam nahin ho rahaa he
 According to the CAG report, in Bihar, gas agencies are supplying up to 92 kilometers away, which is completely against the rule and there is a lot of delay in the supply
 in vyavasthaaon ke khilaaf sabhi nae alpiji vitarakon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhane kaa faisla kiya he
 They say that the system has been fixed in other states, but this is not yet possible in Bihar, due to which they are getting caught in a severe economic crisis

 har saal kii tarah is baar bhi america kii hi nahin duniya kii charchit patrika 'time' ne 'person of da year' ke liye readers pole (online voting) karwaai jisamen logon se poocha gaya ki unke mutabik koun he 'person of da year'

 twitor par is nattejey kii ghoshnaa ke baad piem modi ke liye kai badhai sandesh aane lage lekin in twits main se kuch aise the jo shaayad maamle ko puraa nahin samaj paae
 It is being written on Twitter that Narendra Modi has been chosen as 'time Person of the Year' which is factually incorrect
 "person of the Year" @narendramodi Congratulations :) - Kaushik Kishore (@_kaushikkishore) December 5, 2016 # narendramodi congratulation to PM for wining the times person of the year award ,2 and in last 3 yrs INDIA shinning - Dharmen bhatt (@dharmenbhatt) December 5, 2016 bataa den ki yah ek online pole he jo ki time magazine karwaati he yah jaanane ke liye ki duniya in hastiyon ko kis nazariye se dekhati he or kise behatar maanati he
 The good thing is that while Modi got 18 percent votes in this poll, names like Putin, Obama and Trump had to be satisfied with 7 percent votes in this poll
 time patrika ne apane online sanskaran main likhaa he ki modi ko sabase zyada vot bharat se mili, saath hi california or new jersey se bhi unke liye kaaphi vot kiye gaye
 But this decision of the readers is not considered the final decision

 But at the same time the magazine also makes it clear that the reader who is not required for this title, should also be chosen as 'person of the Year' by the magazine
 agar ham pehle ke faislon ko dekhen to paaenge ki time patrika ke sampadakon ne baar baar pathakon kii pasand ko darkinar karte hue antim faisla kuch or hi liya he
 When it was first online poll in 1998, wrestler Mick Foley was voted by readers by more than 50 percent, but the magazine chose Bill Clinton and Ken Star as Person of the Year that year
 foli ke prashansak is faisle se naaraaz ho gaye kyonki vah galati se online pole ke faisle ko hi aakhri nirnay maan baithe the
 It is also interesting to know here what is the meaning of 'person of the Year' according to this magazine
 kai log is sheershak ko 'mahanata' ke saath jodate hue dekhte hai lekin patrika ke mutabik is tital kaa arth us vyakti, ghatana yaa vastu se he jisane us puure saal kii gatividhiyon par bahut zyada asar daalaa ho
 This effect can be both good or bad, perhaps because disputed names such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Ayatollah Khomeini have also become Person of the Year
 haalanki baad main magazine vivaadit naamon se zaraa bachane lagi
 This was the reason that Time chose New York City Mayor Rudolph Julayini for Person of the Year following the 9 / 11 attacks
 haalanki charchaa is baat kii bhi chali thi ki patrika ne apane sampadakeey main is baat kii taraf ishaara kiya he ki darasal osama bin laden ko 'person of da year' hai kyonki al qaayada ke 9 / 11 hamale ne puri duniya ko hilaakar rakh diya tha
 The comments chalate chalate ek baat or, jarur nahin ki time dwaara 'person of da year' ke rup main hameshaa kisi vyakti ko hi nahin chunaa jaae
 As Time says he sees how much this 'person' has made an impact around the world this year, so in 1966 it chose the 'inheritor', that is, the generation of American youth under 25 years of age, So chose Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968
 1982 main computer ko or 2006 main 'you' yani ham sabko chunaa gaya jiskaa pratinidhitiv internet kar rahaa he

 supreme court ne niveshkon ke 20 hajaar karod rupye lautaane ke sambandh main sahaara samooh kaa prastaav aaj thukraa diya
 The court said that it would have to move a 'respectable' motion
 sahaara samooh ke mukhiya subrat roy ko abhi mangalvaar tak tihaad jail main hi rahanaa hoga, kyonki nyaayalay is maamle main ab 11 march ko hi aage vichaar karegaa
 The apex court expressed displeasure over the fact that the special bench had to sit for consideration of its case, but did not move any concrete motion
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki yah to peeth kaa 'apmaan' he
 In front of the bench of Justice KS Radhakrishnan and Justice JS Khehar, the Sahara Group said that it is ready to make a cash payment of Rs 2500 crore within three days
 samooh ne aashwaasan diya ki baaki ke 14,900 karod rupye kaa bhugtan paanch kishton main july, 2015 ke ant tak kar diya jayega
 Sebi also opposed this proposal and said that Sahara Group has to pay 34,000 crore rupees, not 17,400 crore
 sebi kaa kahana tha ki samooh 17,400 crores rupye kaa bhugtan karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya tha
 To this, the judges said, "this is not a correct proposal and the motion should be honorable
" ' nyaayamurti khehad ne kaha, 'aapane hame ekatra (vishesh peeth) kiya or phir aap kah rahe hai ki aap dhan dene kii sthiti main nahin he

 He said, 'A person who can arrange money is not in this situation
 sirf vahi dhan kii vyavastha kar sakate hai
 If they are allowed to come out, they can find some way out
 hamen bhi unase mulaakaat kii anumati nahin he
 ' is par nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki roy ke vittiya salaahkaar or vakeelon ko hiraasat main unase mulaakaat kii vyavastha kii ja sakati he, lekin itnaa to spasht he ki dhan kaa bhugtan karne se bachane kaa koi rasta nahin he
 The judges said, "he (roy) was out for the last year and a half and he has been in jail for the last few days
" ham mulaakaat kii vyavastha kar sakate hai, lekin aapako dhan kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 ' iske baad nyaayalay ne roy ke vittiya salaahkaar or vakeelon ko rojaanaa subah das baje se dopaher baarah baje tak unase mulaakaat kii anumati dene kaa aadesh diya
 Another senior advocate Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed that no investor has complained against the group and the court should also consider the aspect that it is a livelihood issue for the 14 lakh employees of Sahara Group

 De De Pyaar De Review: Bollywood has not yet matured to make films on bold topics like age gap
 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' ko dekhte hue jehan main pehali baat yahi kaundhti he
 Being in love with a 26-year-old girl at age 50 is not common at all
 diarector is vishay ko uthaate hue is baat ko bhul hi gaye ki ve teen logon ke rishton ko lekar film garh rahe hai
 The kind of chemistry Akiv Ali has shown between the trio of Ajay Devgn, Tabu, and Rakul Preet Singh is ridiculous
 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' kii kahani 50 saal ke ajay devgan kii he jo apni patni se alag ho chukaa he
 Ajay Devgan falls in love with Rakul Preet, 26 years old
 yah anokhi lav story puure ufaan par bahati he
 Ajay Devgan reaches out to his ex-wife and children with this young companion
 uske baad shuru hoti he ajeebogareeb kahani
 The first half makes some laughs but in the second half it seems that the director does not understand how to contain the raita that he has spread
 film kii raftaar bahut slo ho jaati he
 The screenplay is also very bad
 agar acting ke morche par khangale to rakul preet singh (rakul Preet Singh) dil jeetne main kaamyaab rahati hai
 The film's life is Rakul Preet Singh and whenever she comes on screen, the face of the audience flashes
 tabboo ne acchhee acting kii he, lekin ajay devgan is role main bahut jame nahin hai, or acting ke maamle main bhi kahin out najar aate hai
 Overall, his acting has been very average
 ye bhi kah sakate hai ki ve is role main kahin missfit lagate hai
 Direction of 'de De Pyaar De (de De Pyaar De)' is very weak and the story is also derailed
 haalanki film kaa sangeet jarur mjedaar he, or un songs par rakul preet singh ko dekhnaa vaaki acha anubhav he
 The connection connecting the youth in the film also appears to be missing
 aise main 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' niraash karti he

 sibiesai ke 12veen class ke rigelt ke liye chaatro ko thodaa or intjaar karnaa padegaa
 The Delhi High Court has directed the CBSE to continue the Grace Marks policy
 iske kaaran chaatro ke number ko gres marks policy ke hisaab se edjust karne main thodaa samay lagegaa,jisase rigelt main deree hogi
 The board had decided to end the Grace Marks policy this year, but the High Court has stayed the CBSE decision
 sibiesai ke gres marks policy khatm karne ke faisle ke khilaaf ek parrant or ek vakil ne hai court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 He said that this policy would have a very bad effect on the students
 yachikakartaon ne court main daleel di thi ki is policy ko khatm karne se khaastaur par ve chaatr buree tarah prabhavit honge, jo videsh se padhai karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 The High Court, after hearing this petition, directed to continue the policy on Monday and termed the move to abolish the policy as 'unreasonable and irresponsible'
 cbsese 12veen class kaa exam denevaale students kaa intjaar abhi khatm nahin hua he
 It was expected that on May 24, CBSE 12th class results will be declared
 ab hai court ke nirdesh ke baad chaatro ke marks ko edjust karne main samay lagegaa, jis kaaran rigelt let ho jayega
 Let us tell you that this year more than 10 lakh 98 thousand students of class 12 have passed the exam from CBSE
 sibiesai ke 12veen class ke rigelt ko 24 may, 2017 yani buudhvaar ko aane kii ummid thi
 CBSE has not yet issued any notification regarding the date and time of the release of class 12 results
 dilli uniwarsity ne admician ke liye registration process shuru kar diya he
 Because of this, CBSE students are eagerly waiting for their results
 kendriya madhyamik shiksha board (CBSE) bharat kii schuli shiksha kaa ek pramukh board he
 Many private schools in and outside India are connected to it
 CBSE se har saal lakhon students exam dete hai
 The 'namo Pen' given to students for taking the 10th and 12th board exams in Gujarat has started a ruckus
 in penon par pradhanmantri modi kii tasviir chhapi he or bijepi ke chunaav chinh camel ke saath 'ai lav modi' bhi likhaa he
 According to the news of Pentimes of India given by the company as a gift, the students have received it as a gift from a private firm
 ahmedabad ke ek skool principal ne bataaya ki unhen namo pen ke 5 se 10 packet mili
 There are five pens in each packet
 har pen ke saath ek patr bhi he jisamen likhaa he ki pen board pariksha dene vaale bacchon ko company kii taraf se tohfa he
 It is also written in the letter that permission has been taken from Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board Chairman RJ Shah and Deputy Chairman RR Thakkar to give this gift
 namo pen par bhadki congressgujrat main 8 march se board parikshaayen shuru ho gai hai
 Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, "the posts of more than 50,000 teachers are vacant in schools
 bacchon ko acchhee shiksha dene kii jagah shiksha vyavastha ko hi raajnneetik rang dene kii koshish ho rahi he
 The BJP wants to give a political color to the education system
 hairaani to is par he ki board ne kaise parikshaon ko raajnneetik tul kii tarah istemaal kii ijaajat de di
 "company's claim - 3 years ago, Modi took permission from Modi, Suresh Zaveri, senior officer of the company distributing pens, said," We have 1 in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Vadnagar
 5 lakh namo pen baante hai
 'he claimed,' Three years ago we proposed this pen to Prime Minister Modi
 us vakt vah pradesh ke mukhyamantri the
 He liked our idea very much
 unhone tabhi hamen isaki ijaajat di thi
 ' aarake narayan kii pustak malgudi days anginat bhashaaon main chhapi or unki sarvaadhik charchit kitabon main shumaar he
 It was also published by many publishers in Hindi and also published its role
 ‘malgudi kii kahaniyaan’ aarake narayan ke adbhut kahani lekhan kaa pratik hai, jo rochak hone ke saath hi shikshaprad bhi hai
 In his beloved residential cities of South India, Mysore and Chennai, the simple characters he saw here and there between modernity and traditionalism made him memorable through his extraordinary story-craft
 par narayan ne yah kitaab kyon likhi, isaki bhoomika kaaphi kuch kahati he or har lekhak or sahityapremi ke liye upyogi he
 Writing stories is easy for the writer because it does not require much work
 upanyaas acha ho yaa bura, chhapane laayak ho yaa na ho, isamen bahut kaam karnaa padataa he
 Too many words have to be written, from sixty thousand to one lakh which at first glance seems to be very difficult task, because writing these words requires attention for a long time, nowadays i write only small novels
 , Yet it continues to bother me working on the same subject for months
 in dinon raat-din dimag main shabd or vaakya ghoomte rahete hai, antim jo shabd likhe the, ve or iske baad kya shabd likhe jaayenge, ve sab kaanon main lagaataar goonjte rahete hai, inke alaava duusari sab awaajen or khushbuin-badbuaen dimaag main ghus hi nahin paatin, baahar se hi waapas chali jaati hai
 When the first layout of the novel has to be made, perhaps even the third and fourth have to be made, until it can be achieved in it - impossible work
 phir kahin vah din aata he jab pandulipi kaa packet banaakar use prakaashak yaa litereri agent ko ravaanaa kiya ja saktaa he
 After completing each novel, i decide not to write another after that - then i write one or two stories
 yahi kaam mujhe acha lagata he
 In writing a novel, where many characters and events have to be written in great detail, a single character or event is enough to write a story, focusing on one main idea or action makes a good story
 is
 bharat main kahani-lekhak ke liye vishyon kii kami nahin hoti
 Our culture is so wide that it is full of subjects
 har aadmi duusare aadmi se na sirf aarthik sthiti main, balki drushtikon, aadaton or yahaan tak ki rosemara ke jivan-darshan main bhi ek-duusare se alag he
 Living and living in a society that does not live the same life as a machine, which does not have one, is very entertaining and exciting
 aisi sthiti main kahani lekhak ke khidki se baahar gardan nikaalkar jhaankate hi use aisa koi charitra mil jaayegaa jis par vah acchhee kahani likh daalega
 The story should be short, it is universally agreed upon, but it is defined in different ways - from general description like a newspaper reporter to a serious depiction of a literary writer, including events, character language, Full attention is given to many things like expression, the author's own particular style, etc
 apni baat karun to mujhe vyakti kii paristhitiyon par uske apane hi charitra sankat main kahani kii saamagree praapt ho jaati he
 In this compilation, about thirty stories have taken any such crisis of most of the person which either he wins or is forced to live with him
 kuch kahaniyaan aisi hai jinamein vyakti ke jivan yaa uski paristhitiyon main koi aisa vishesh kshan dikhaai detaa he jisko pakadaney se hi kahani ban jaati he
 i have named this collection in the town of Malgudi, as it gives it a geographical personality
 log aksar poochhate hai :‘lekin yah malgudi he kahaan ?’ jawaab main main yahi kahata hum ki yah kaalpanik naam he or duniya ke kisi bhi nakshe main ise dhundha nahin ja saktaa
 Although the University of Chicago has published a literary atlas, in which a map of India has been made and Malgudi is also shown in it
 agar main kahuun ki malgudi dakshin bharat main ek kasbaa he to yah bhi adhuri sachai hogi, kyonki malgudi ke lakshan duniya main har jagah mil jaayenge
 i find signs of Malgudi in New York as well: Twenty-third street in the western part of the city, where i have often lived for several months after 1959, where there has never been any alteration of the township marks and people's lives - on the Synagogue stairs
 The drunken drunken, the shop at which is always written in big words: Everything here is sold in a week - fifty percent of the sale forever; There are barber shops, dentists, lawyers, fishing hooks, special stores and delicious food and drink restaurants
 main pehali baar gaya to maalik ne swaagat karte hue kaha ‘aap bahut din baad aaye
 Nowadays you said milk, rice, etc
 kharidte hai ?’ usne yah bhi nahin sochaa ki main na taeesvin sadak kaa baashinda hum, na america kaa nivasee hum
 It is not the same as ever, its stability and mutual harmony never matter
 or wo chelsi hotel jahaan jab main kai saal baad pahunchaa to manager ne lapakkar meraa swaagat kiya or kushi se bharkar gale se hi nahin laga liya, apane samooche staff ko bulaakar, tab tak jo zindaa rah gayi the mujhase milwaaya, inamen pahiyevaali kursi par chalane-phirane vaala vah purana nivasee bhi tha jisaki umr ab lagbhag 116 saal thi
 And when i stayed in this hotel last time, it must have been a little over 90
 is tarah malgudi ek kalpana kaa kasbaa hi he lekin yah mere uddeshyon ke liye bahut upyogi siddh hua he
 And no matter how much pressure is put on me, i cannot improve it much
 pichley dinon jab landan ke ek utsaahi television nirmaataa ne mujhase kaha ki main use malgudi le jaakar dikhaaun or uske charitron se milaauun jisase mujh par ghante-bhar kaa ek acha-sa feechar taiyaar kiya ja sake, to kshambhar ke liye to main saham hi gaya, or jawaab main itnaa bhar hi kah sakaa, ‘maaf karnaa, aajkal main nayaa upanyaas likhane main zaraa zyaada hi biji hum
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "will this novel also be on Malgudi?" He asked
 ‘haa, or kya,’ main bolaa
 "what is its subject?" Its theme is the effect of the lion on the soul of man
 
 
 
 "wow, that must be very interesting
" main tab tak intjaar karuunga
 Then the documentary will be made, the lion will create a lot of fun in it

 The Congress government of Karnataka has bought luxury cars worth Rs 5 crore from taxpayers for its 30 ministers
 khaas baat he ki pichhali bijepi sarkaar ke samay kharidi gai kai nai kaaren ab tak prayog main nahin laai gai hai
 Two months ago, after the formation of the Congress government in Karnataka, people who became ministers have been given new cars purchased by the government for Rs 14 lakh
 nai kaaren kharidne ke peeche sarkaar kii ore se tark diya ja rahaa he ki mantri purv main kharidi gai kaaron kaa prayog nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 NDTV has found that most of the cars allocated to ministers during the previous government are still in the condition of new cars
 ye sabhi kaaren sarkari guest house main khadi hai
 The Department of Personnel, which oversees these cars and oversees new cars, says it is a policy that new cars are allocated whenever a new government is formed
 isi se yah baat saaf he ki har baar sarkaar badalane ke saath hi kareeb 30 kaaren karadaataaon ke rupayon se kharid lee jaati hai
 This policy continues unabated by the authorities

 According to the rule, any minister can demand a new car if the car has completed the journey of one lakh kilometers or the car has completed three years
 pichhali sarkaar main teen mukhyamantri the, is dauraan do car zyada kharidni padi thi

 yahaan tak ki purv pradhanmantri echdi devegoda ko is varsh ke aarambh main 22 lakh kii fortuner di gai he
 After all, why there is no such waste of money of taxpayers, no one has the answer

 Referring to the disruptions of Parliament in previous sessions, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting said, "it is really ridiculous that those who are shedding crocodile tears in the name of chivalry, they have done phd in creating barriers

" lekin mujhe hansi aati he ki koun log hai jo sansadeey shishttaaon kii baat kar rahe hai, sansad ke satr ko lekar koun log chintaa dikhaa rahe hai
 Manish Tiwari said, "don't we all remember the Parliament session that took place in November 2010, which was completely an uproar
" kya hamen pichley saal kaa monsoon satr yaad nahin jo puri tarah shor-sharabe main nikal gaya

 On the question related to the jet-etihad agreement, Manish Tiwari said that the government took decisions after considering all the points
 unhone kaha, ‘jab aap aarthik kshetra main udaartaa baratate hai, to jaahir taur par log aate hai or apana paksh rakhte hai
 When a government makes a decision, it considers all possible points and approaches the best possible decision in the national interest

 Former CM of UP Akhilesh Yadav was also present in this meeting and Mulayam Singh's brother Shivpal was also present
 darasal
 Mulayam Singh Yadav is suffering from the problem of hyper glycemia (hyper tension) and hyper diabetes
 isse pehle jab unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha to unase mulaakaat ke liye raksha mantri rajnath singh bhi pahunche the
 At the same time, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, brother Shivpal Yadav and son Akhilesh Yadav also came to take Mulayam's health
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke dauraan upi ke purv mukhyamantri or samaajawaadee party ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ne na ke baraabar hi chunavi sabhaayen kii hai, vahiin unhone mainpuri se chunaav ladaa or chunaav main jeet bhi hasil kii
 But they have been facing health problems for quite some time
 vahiin mulaayam singh ko ravivaar ko hi lakhanu ke lohia institute main hai sugar kii samasya kii vajah se chekup ke liye bhartee karavaaya gaya tha
 Where dr bhuwan chandra tiwari kii dekharekh main mulaayam singh yadav kaa ilaaj hua
 Let us know that Mulayam Singh Yadav has been meeting Akhilesh and Shivpal separately for the last several days and trying to resolve the ongoing differences between the two
 loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party kaa niraashajanak pradarshan rahaa
 Since then, Mulayam Singh Yadav has stepped up renewed efforts to restore the relationship between his son Akhilesh and brother Shivpal
 espi ko mili mahaj 5 sitendrasal, is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ne gathbandhan kiya tha
 However, this alliance failed in front of the storm of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa-ralod ke saath aane ke baavjood gathbandhan sirf 15 siten hi jeet paaya, to vahiin bhaajapa akele dam par 62 siten ( apana dal samet 64) laane main kaamyaab rahi
 The Samajwadi Party was reduced to just 5 seats and the Bahujan Samaj Party 10 seats
 aam chunaav 2019 main mulaayam mainpuri, akhilesh yadav azamgarh or ajam khan rampur se chunaav jite
 However Dimple Yadav contested from Kannauj seat in this election, where he lost
 vahiin is chunaav main mayawati ne aarope lagaaya ki shivpal yadav ne is chunaav main vot kaatane kaa kaam kiya he
 In fact, last year Shivpal formed his own party called 'progressive Samajwadi Party'
 unhone kunbe main foot ke liye rishte ke bhai or party mahasachiv ram gopal yadav ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 After which, now Mulayam Singh Yadav is trying to bring back Akhilesh and Shivpal

 ) Recently, Dusu President Amit Tanwar was seen openly posing for a photo with a rifle at Delhi University's North Campus
 yahi nahin in photo ko soshal media par post bhi kiya gaya he
 Surprisingly, this photo session took place during the Memorial Service of Pradeep Tanwar, brother of Dusu President Amit Tanwar
 photo main haal hi main dilli uniwarsity student union (DUSU) adhyaksh bane amit tanwar doston ke saath poj dete dekhe ja sakate hai
 This picture has been proudly posted on social media by his friends throughout the festival
 in tasveeron ko north campus main bane dusu offis main liya gaya he
 Let us tell you that according to university rules, it is strictly prohibited to carry any gun on campus
 tasveeron ko lekar jab uniwarsity ke dean jeem khurana se sawaal kiye gaye to unka kahana tha ki mujhe aisi koi jaankaree nahin he
 If this happens, action will be taken
 jab is par dusu adhyaksh se poocha gaya to jawaab mila ki tasveeron main dikhaai de rahi bandooken personal security officer kii hai
 But the question is, why did the security officer need so many guns on campus and with the conduct of this photoshoot, why did the president himself put the rules in public eye? anna hajaare ke saath dilli police kii baatcheet fail ho gai he
 Delhi Police officials had gone to Tihar to persuade Anna but they have returned empty-handed
 darasal, anshan kii samay seemaa ko lekar dilli police kii peshkash se anna sahamat nahin hai
 In support of Anna Hazare, the Janata Delhi Police on the road offered to give Anna Ramlila grounds for the fast, but on this condition, Anna would go on a fast for seven days
 haalanki, isamen nukta ye bhi he ki halaat kii samiksha ke baad ye samay seemaa badhaai ja sakati he
 However, Anna is not ready to sign the offer
 dekhen kaise giraftaar hue anna hajarinna kam se kam 30 din kaa vakt chaahate hai
 It is clear from Anna's attitude that he does not trust the Delhi Police
 unhen lagata he ki ek baar saat din par sahmati jataane par dilli police iskaa beja istemaal kar sakati he
 After seven days, the approval of his fast can be canceled after the situation is bad
 anna hajaare tihaad jail se baahar kyon nahin aa rahe hai? dilli police or anna hajaare ke bich koun-si pench fansi he, jis vajah se anna tihaad se baahar nikalne ko taiyaar nahin
 See what the Prime Minister said in the Lok Sabha on Anna, according to reports, the screw is stuck about the time limit of the fast
 dilli police anna ko ramlila maidan main saat se das din anshan karne kii ijaajat dene ko taiyaar he
 Even after reviewing the situation, Delhi Police has also assured to increase the time limit
 lekin, anna is peshkash par dastakhat karne ko taiyaar nahin
 They want at least thirty days
 aisi khabaren hai ki dilli police kii peshkash par team anna ke saare sadsy raji the lekin arvind kejariwal is par sahamat nahin the
 Because of this, the matter got stuck
 anna hajaare or unke samarthakon ke tevar ko dekhte hue aaj dilli police ne puri tarah you-turn le liya
 See: The gathering of people gathered outside Tihar Jail in Delhi demanded a big ground for fasting in place of JP Park
 dilli police ne ramlila maidan de diya
 Not only this, there should be no restriction on the number of people coming for the fast, Delhi Police has accepted this
 udhar, anna ke andolan se tihaad jail ke kaidiyon ko ho rahi he asuvidha ke sambandh main kiran bedi ne pradarshnakariyon ko sambodhit kiya
 He appealed to the people to vacate gate number three as it is a way to provide milk, vegetables and logistics to the prisoners in the jail
 logon kii bheed kii vajah se mangalvaar se jail ke bheetar koi saamaan nahin gaya he isse kaidiyon ko asuvidha ho rahi he
 See what is the central government ombudsman's draft
 After the negotiations between Anna and the police ended on Wednesday late evening, it was reported that Anna's health had worsened and he complained of chest pain
 baad main anna kii team ne anna kii tabiyat kharaab hone kii khabar ko afvaah dekar ise sire se khaarij kar diya he

 Bihar has to face floods and droughts every year
 badhati aabaadi or pradooshan kii vajah se logon kaa janajivan prabhavit ho rahaa he
 The density of population in Bihar is three times the average of the country
 aise main paryaavaran ko santulit karne kaa ek maatr upaay vriksharopan he
 The Bihar government has started focusing on this over the years
 iskaa nateeja bhi acha dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 In the same sequence, the Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Bihar, 15 in the next five years
 10 karod paudharopan kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya he
 With this much plantation, 2 percent forest cover will be increased in Bihar
 iske tahat van kshetron ke baahar sarkari bhoomi par pathon, naharon, tatbandhon ityadi par bhi vriksharopan kii yojana he
 The biggest problem in Bihar is the increasing population
 2011 ke janaganana ke anusaar desh kii jansankhya kaa ghanatv jahaan 382 vyakti prati varg kilometre he, vahiin bihar main jansankhya kaa ghanatv teen guna zyada 1102 vyakti prati varg kilometre he
 This is the reason that in Bihar's Third Agricultural Road Map 2017-2022, the environment and forest department has set a target of increasing the forest cover outside the forest areas by 2 percent
 abhi bihar main 15 pratishat vanavaran he
 Significantly, to achieve the target of afforestation on 15 percent of the land area of the state by 2017, the Department of Environment and Forests has 23
 95 karod paudhon dwaara vriksharopan karne kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya
 18 by the department on departmental land, government land and agricultural forestry as farmers' land
 47 karod vriksharopan kiya gaya
 During the period 2012-17, 621 lakh trees were planted on 1,58,814 hectares of forest land with soil and moisture conservation work
 prakritik wanon main parampara se alag keval vrikshon ko kendrit kar banaai gai yojana ke vipareet puure iko-system ko aadhaar maan kar kaary yojanaayen taiyaar kii gai hai
 Water-logging development will be done in the natural forests, which will prevent soil erosion as well as water conservation
 paryaavaran evam van vibhaag, bihar main vrihad str par vriksharopan kar baadh / sookhaa ko kam karne karne ke liye sachet he
 In the form of agricultural forestry, the department is continuously working towards reducing the effects of floods by undertaking plantation work on the farmers' real estate
 grih mantralay ne aatanki hamalon ke maddenjar ehtiyaat ke taur par taj mahal kii suraksha badhaane ke aadesh die hai
 CISF is currently responsible for the security of this mausoleum in Agra, one of the seven wonders of the world
 yah khubasurat imaarat pehle se hi napak iraadaa rakhane vaale aatankiyon ke ankhon main khatkati rahi he
 Significantly, after the terrorist attacks on Mumbai, security arrangements have been tightened in all sensitive places in the country
 taaja aadesh ke baad agra main suraksha or kadi kar di gai he
 The perpetrators of the crime are kept in jail for sentencing
 makasad yah bhi hota he ki mujrim baahar rahakar koi aparaadh na kar saken
 But when the prison itself becomes a den of crime and the government tells us what to do
 tab sawaal uthta he ki aakhir sarkaar kaa matlab kya he
 This is the reality in Punjab, where the government seems helpless and helpless in front of the criminals in the jails
 jail kaa kadava sachapunjab kii jelon main aise-aise gunaah hote hai, jinke bare main sunakar aapke hosh ud jaaenge
 Jails are meant to curb the prisoners, but in Punjab jails, the gangsters are taking away the rules and regulations
 bathinda kii jail main narwanaa gang ke badmaash mobile par baat karte hai
 So in Sangrur jail, gangster Gurjit Bhati celebrates birthday by cutting cake
 kahin patiala jail main band laurence gang ke badmaash police waalon kii gaadi main baithkar unke saamne hi mobile se tasviir khinchate hai
 So arms are displayed in jail somewhere
 yahi he punjab kii jelon kaa kadava sach
 The use of social media in jail is so much happening behind bars in Punjab jails that the viewers should be surprised
 haal main aaj tak ke haath lagi tasveeron se saaf jaahir he ki punjab kii jelon main kaidiyon ko kis kadar azaadi mili he
 Another great example of this is the Facebook account of Vicky, a crook of the Shera Khabba gang operating in Bathinda
 gangster se netaa bane jasvindar rocky kii 30 april ko hatya kar di gai
 After that, Vicky claimed responsibility for the murder of former gangster Rocky via Facebook post
 saath higangstervicky gounder fasebuk par hi jile ke esaspi ko khuli chunauti detaa hua najar aayaa
 The security of the country is a threat to the jails of Punjab
 The fact that gangsters are committing crimes in the outside world by sitting in the jails of Punjab
 is vajah se police hi nahin balki army bhi pareshaan he
 After the Pathankot attack, intelligence agencies have prepared a report
 is report main military intelligence ne kaha he ki punjab kii kai jail desh kii suraksha ke liye bada khatara sabit ho sakati hai
 The pictures revealed also expose this fact
 magar hairaani kii baat he ki punjab sarkaar salaakhon ke peeche baithkar gunahon ko anjaam dene vaale aparaadhiyon par roak lagane ke bajaay centre par hi sawaal uthaa rahi he
 Gangsters locked in the jails of Gangpunj, who have become a challenge for the government, have made a living of common people
 salaakhon ke peeche baithe badmaashon ke ishaare par tamaam gunaah anjaam die jate hai
 And the Badal government is failing to stop them
 bathinda kaa shera khabba gang, sangrur kaa gurjeet bhaati gang, bathinda kaa narwanaa gang, kapoorthala kaa sukkha kahalo gang or patiala kaa laurence gang khulkar kanoon or sarkaar ko dhata bataa rahe hai
 Vicky Gounder in Bathinda jail confessed to the murder through Facebook post and claimed to have been murdered
 chaar saal pehle shera khabba gang kaa badmaash gurshaid singh encounter main maaraa gaya tha
 Jaswinder was suspected of being involved in the encounter of Shera Khabba gang
 ye donon hi gang jail main fasebuk kaa istemaal karte the
 Jail officers are helpers of miscreants when the murder of gangster Jaswinder Rocky once again pointed to the growing crime in the jails of Punjab
 to ek may ko 100 police waalon kii team ne bathinda jail main chapa maaraa
 The prison was intensively searched for two hours
 lekin is talaashi abhiyaan ke dauraan police ko keval ek mobile phone baraamad hua
 The jail administration was then accused of helping the miscreants
 aapattijanak chizon ko chaape se pehle hi jail se hataa diya gaya
 Another example was found of the collusion of the jail administration and gangsters
 bekhauf hai jail main band gangstersapunjab kii jelon main drugs taskari, kidnaping, cotract kiling or rangadari kaa dhandha fal phool rahaa he
 The news is that the big gangsters get mobile phone, internet and all facilities through the jail administration
 punjab kii jelon main band gang or unase jude badmaash kis kadar bekhof hai iskaa pataa is baat se chalata he ki april 2015 ko gurjeet singh bhaati ne sangrur jail se fasebuk par apni tasviir aplod kii
 Gurjit Bhati gang, lodged in Sangrur jail, is accused of demanding 8 lakh ransom from a businessman
 usase pehle march 2015 main narwanaa gang ke kulbir singh ne apni tasviren fasebuk par post kii thim
 In December 2014, gangster Gurpreet Sheikh had demanded a ransom of 10 lakh from the jail
 kapoorthala jail main band sukkha kahalon gang ke badmaash aksar fasebuk kaa istemaal karte aae hai
 It is certain that the gangsters in jail have a hand in the major crimes that take place in Punjab
 suraksha agenciyon kii maane to ab ye gang sirf aam aadmi or punjab sarkaar ke liye hi nahin balki puure desh kii suraksha ke liye khatara sabit ho rahe hai
 It is obvious that the crimes committed in jails will have to be stopped very soon

 After Akhilesh Yadav became the SP chief, Mulayam was not seen in any of the recent events of Singhparty

 In such a situation, questions are arising whether Mulayam has been sidelined in his own party

 Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Vinay Katiyar has once again reiterated the construction of the Ram temple and asked the Muslims to give up their claim on Ayodhya
 unhone kaha ki ayodhya par muslim apana daawa chhod den ab sabit ho gaya he ki yah ram janmabhumi hi he
 Katiyar said that as a third option in the construction of Kiram temple, the government can also make laws in Parliament
 unhone ayodhya ke saath kaashi gyaan vaapi masjid or mathura kii idgah ko bhi khaali karaane kii baat kahi he
 'we will not allow Namaz to be read at that place' said the BJP MP, who attended a wedding ceremony in Farrukhabad, UP, 'we want all three places
 ram janmabhumi bhi chahie
 Baba Vishwanath needs wisdom in Kashi and the place of Idgah in Mathura
 ab tak ayodhya main mandir nahi bana agayodhya main bhavy mandirban chukaa hota to ham daawa nahin karte
 The premises of the Gyan Vapi where the Namaz is to be evacuated
 vahaan par namaaj nahin padhanaa chahie
 It is wrong to name Idgah in Krishna's birthplace in Mathura
 adaalat ne bhi krishna janmabhumi mana he
 Now that ground has to be emptied of Idgah as well
 ''teen main se ek vikalp hoga kargar'ram mandir ke mudde par unhone kaha ki ayodhya se sabhi kii bhavanaaen judi hai
 Now there are three ways to construct the temple
 pehla baatcheet, doosraa court or teesraa sansad
 Now Muslims must accept that this is a temple and the court also accepted that it is a temple
 ab aage kii ladaai musalamaanon ko band kerani chahie or mandir nirmaan main sahyog karnaa chahie
 There can be no better brotherhood than this
 agar nahin hoga to tino main se koiek vikalpchunanaa padegaa ki ram mandir bane iskaa maarg prashast hoga
 'if the court did not work
 
 
 'katiyaar ne ram mandir nirmaan ke liye sansad main kanoon banane kii baat kahi
 He said that we do not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, but in spite of this, if we feel that our work is not being done by the court, then we can also make a law in Parliament

 The legislative competency of legislators will be determined only by the decision of the court
 yadi court vidhansabha adhyaksh ke faisle ko sahi tehraata he, to yah yediurppa ke liye badi kamyaabi sabit hogi
 But if the court decides in favor of the mlas, then this is sure to create new problems for the BJP in the state

 seth ne kaha ki kshamta vistaar par 1,700 karod rupee ke nivesh ke baad emesai kii salanaa utpaadan kshamta 2012 tak 12
 5 lakh units
 bajet ke baad yah pehla aisa mauka he jab desh main sone kii kharidfrokht premium par ho rahi he, jo pichley maheene ke madhya tak 4 fisadi discount par ho rahi thi
 Premium discounts can be understood in easy language that importers who import gold in the country were giving gold to big bullion traders earlier with some discounts which are no longer giving, but are paying something expensive
 pehle yah samaj lijie ki aisa hota kyon he? darasal ayatak puure saal desh main sona aayaat karte hai or sarrapha kaarobaari bhi unase lagaataar sone kii kharid karte hai
 When demand in the market weakens or when the possibility of a fall in gold prices deepens, importers start selling gold with a discount, but as soon as gold is expected to rise due to good demand or domestic and global cues Then it turns into discount premium
 jab discount zyada miltaa he to sarrapha kaarobaari iskaa phayda graahakon tak bhi pahunchaate hai
 Now a question also arises that the price of gold is either fixed in the spot market or at which rate the discount and premium are given on the futures market i
e
 multi commodity exchange
 aapako bataa den ki discount or premium kaa aadhaar mulya landan bullian market associesan ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 Ajay Kedia, managing director of Kedia Commodity, says, "there is no difference between the futures of December and March at this time
 jabaki saamanyat: yah 300 rupye zyada par trade hota he
 The reason for this is that the market is hoping that the government will cut the import duty of gold, which will cause the price to fall
 "as the price is expected to be lower due to future tax cuts, the premium is gone
 hajir bazaar main bajet ke baad pehali baar sona kareeb 1 fisadi premium par trade kar rahaa he
 Referring to this, Kedia says, "gold is expected to boom in the coming days
" sona is saal kareeb 20 fisadi kaa ritern de chukaa he
 But the real boom in this is only 12 - 12
 5 fisadi kii he
 The remaining 2
 5 fisadi aayaat shulk badhane or rupye ke kamjor hone ke kaaran ai he
 "the historical boom of gold suggests that the trend of gold never stops in one year, this trend can continue for the next 2 to 3 years
" yahi kaaran he ki gharelu maang kamjor hone ke baad bhi sona premium ke saath kaarobaar kar rah he
 Why the demand picks up after the weak? Gold business declined by up to 40 per cent during Dhanteras and Diwali
 mandi, berogari or gramin ilaakon main sankat sone kii maang kamjor rahane ke bhi sanket detaa he
 But then what is the reason that despite such sluggish demand, estimates of the rise in gold are being made
 kedia bataate hai, ‘’bharat ke bazaar main sone kii keemton ko vaishvik bazaar se hi disha milti he
 The Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates after 11 years shows that the US economy is in trouble
 ’’ sona surakshit nivesh ke lihaaj se niveshkon kii pehali pasand hota he
 In such a situation, the brightness in gold after cutting interest rates is bound to increase
 iske alaava jio political tension, china main shuru hone vaale new year celibrasion tamaam aise sanket hai jo sone kii keemton main teji ko bal de rahe hai
 Gold boom in the global market also makes gold expensive in India
 yani gharelu maang ke itar sone main teji ke vaishvik kaaran zyada hai
 Domestically, investors will also have the option of sleeping on falling interest on savings and falling into the recession of the economy
 saath hi rupye kii kamajori bhi teji kaa ek bada kaaran ban sakati he
