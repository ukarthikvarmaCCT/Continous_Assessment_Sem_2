 godhra dangon se nipatane ke kaaran khaasi aalochana kaa shikaar bane modi gulburg socity maamle main ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ke baad alpsankhyak samudaay tak pahunch banane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Modi is starting a three-day fast for peace, unity and equality in the state on the occasion of his 62nd birthday
 modi ne desh ke logon ko likhe ek patr main kaha, gujarat main 2001 main bheeshan bukamp aayaa or pradesh 2002 main sampradayik dangon kii aag main jhulasa
 We can imagine what a bad day those were
 unhone kaha, gujarat un kaale dinon se baahar nikal gaya or ab vikaas ke path par agrasar he
 The atmosphere of peace, unity, equality and brotherhood is increasing the progress of Gujarat
 modi ne kaha, desh ke itihaas main yah dekhne main aayaa he ki jatvaad or sampradayik unmaad ke jehar ne kabhi kisi kii madad nahin kii
 Gujarat has understood this
 aise vikaron se upar uthakar gujarat ne vikaas ke path ko chunaa
 Your love has encouraged me to come more close to you

 When Sachin Tendulkar was taught to play cricket by Sir Achrekar, a boy used to play better cricket than Sachin, whom Ramakant Achrekar considered better player than Sachin and called him Viv Richards
 lekin is ladke ke bhai ne uski raah main aisa roda atakaya ki uskaa kariyar vahiin tham gaya
 It is a matter of coincidence that this boy's brother's name is also Ajit and Sachin's brother's name is also Ajit
 sachin ke saath khilne vaale is ladke kaa naam tha anil gurv
 Anil is now heavily intoxicated and is leading a life of oblivion in a chawl in Nalasopara, Mumbai
 aachrekar kii pehali pasand sachin nahin, anil tha!bheed main gum ho chukaa anil gurv ek jamaane main sachin tendulkar ke guru ramakant aachrekar kii pehali pasand hua karte the or sar use viv richards ke naam se bulaate the
 You may not be convinced seeing Anil today, but people used to leave their work and reach the ground to see Anil's batting
 aaj vahi anil gurv gumnami ke andhere main hai
 When Sachin started his cricketing career, he used to try to play cricket like Anil Guru
 khud guru aachrekar ne sachin ko anil gurv kaa khel dekhne or unase seekhney kii salaah di thi
 Sachin was hit by Anil's bat, Sachin Tendulkar, who scored a century in the first century international matches, was also convinced of Anil Guru
 sachin ne under 14 ke apane pehle match ke liye anil ke bat kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Not only this, Sachin also scored the first century of his life with Anil's bat
 anil gurv bataate hai, 'sachin sharma rahaa tha
 
 maine kaha, leki ja bat, us bat se usne jindagi kii pehali centuri lagaai
 'achrekar had told Anil's mother, Anil changed your future, Ramasant Achrekar, the Guru of Degaschin, was confident that Anil Guru would one day become a great player
 yahi vajah thi ki aachrekar khud anil ko apni scooter par baitaakar maidan main lekar jate or net par abhyaas karaate the
 Anil said, 'they used to take me from Azad Maidan to Bengal Ground by sitting on a scooter
 vahaan jaakar net practice
 Sir did a lot for me
 'anil kii maa ko guru ramakant ne kaha tha ki unki jindagi main jaldi hi khushiyaan aane vaali hai
 Anil's mother Sumitra Gurav herself told that Achrekar ji used to say, "mother, don't worry, Anil will change your future
" kariyar kii tabaahi ke liye bhai jimmedarnil kaa kariyar us daur main teji se aage bad rahaa tha
 But there was a turning point in Anil's life, which ended his cricketing career forever
 anil ke mutabik, uskaa chota bhai ajit gaiyrkanoonee gatividhiyon main shaamil ho gaya tha
 Because of this, Anil's life was threatened
 police bhi unhen pareshaan karne lagi
 In such a situation, he stopped going to the field
 paison ke liye gaya nite cricket memonil gurv ne iske baad paison ke liye tennis cricket khelnaa shuru kar diya
 Guru Achrekar had also denied him many times for this
 anil khud sweekaarte hai ki tennis kii ball se kheli jane vaali nite cricket unke jivan kii sabase badi bhul thi
 Sir was reprimanded for drinking alcohol
 Today, Anil Gurv is mostly drunk with alcohol
 kuch saalon pehle jab guru ramakant kii unase mulaakaat hui to unhone iske liye anil ko danta bhi tha
 Anil told that when Achrekar met Sir, he said, 'I taught you to play cricket, not drink
 ' ab wo guru se maafee maangate hai
 Sachin recognizes Anil immediately Anil Guru is convinced of Sachin
 kuch saal pehle anil apane cricketer dost kiran manjrekar ke saath ek gymkhana main sachin ko dekhne pahunche to unhen dar tha ki shaayad sachin unhen pahachaanenge nahin
 Anil could not even reach close to Sachin due to the police arrangements, but Sachin immediately recognized Anil and called him to him
 anil gurv us yaad ko taaja karte hue kehete hai, 'mujhe dekhte hi bolaa, anil, kitne dinon baad? ghar aao milane

 sibiai ke mutabik, sabrang communications and publicing privet limited ke nideshak kii haisiyat se donon ne america ke ek gaiyr-munaafe vaale sanghathan ford foundation se 2,90,000 dollar kaa videshi anudaan liya tha, jabaki unke paas na to epasiare kaa koi khaataa tha or na hi unhone grih mantralay se uchit anumati hi lee thi
 Sabrang says it received $ 90,000 on April 5, 2004 and $ 200,000 on September 22, 2006 for 'active research against communalism and caste-based discrimination in India, web-based information dissemination, development of civil society networks and Media strategies'
 sitalwar or anand kaa kahana he ki is sambandh main samjhaute or gatividhi report sibiai, epasiare ke adhikariyon or gujarat police ko saunpi ja chuki he
 She says, "why is CBI raiding our premises after so many years? Eventually the first batch of grants from the Ford Foundation came in 2004 and the second in 2006
 ''grih mantralay ke sutron ne bataaya ki sibiai ne gujarat ke grih mantralay kii ore se kiye gaye anurodh ke aadhaar par chapa maaraa tha
 The Ministry wanted to examine the source of the grants of Setalvad
 aisa lagata he ki isi jaanch ke baad sarkaar ke saamne yah khulaasa hua hoga ki ford foundation uske yahaan panjikrut nahin he
 During this time, the Gujarat Police accused Setalvad for constructing a memorial in the name of the riot victims of Gujarat
 72 karod ru
 Mobilized and spent it on personal things like cosmetics and food
 police kaa kahana he ki apane nijee kharch ke liye ve credit card kaa istemaal karti thim jise baad main trust ke fund se chukaa detii thim
 Sitalvad says, "I am being made a victim because i helped record the statements of at least 500 riot victims with the CJP as witnesses
" '' sibiai ne jis tareeke se sitalwar ke ghar or daftar main chapa markar 22 ghante tak talaashi lee, vah apane aap main bahut atapata tha
 Senior Delhi advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan asks, "assuming that the warrant did not mention what the CBI was looking for, what basis is there to say that Teesta is not cooperating?" The CBI did not even give her a list of the documents she has taken
 ''agast ke hycourt ke faisle kaa ek ahm pahalu yah he ki usamen sitalwar ko desh main kahin bhi or kabhi bhi ghoomane kii chhot di gai he
 Apparently, it also covers a distance of 527 km between Mumbai and Ahmedabad and by covering this distance, she can come to the Gujarat High Court in Sonia Gokani's court where the case of Zakia Jafri is now being heard
 danga peediton kaa maananaa he ki jakiya or naroda paatia ke maamalon main sitalwar kaa vahaan rahanaa bahut jaruri he
 The riots in Naroda Patiya on the outskirts of Ahmedabad killed 97 people and 32 people were convicted in 2012 only with the help of Setalvad
 kai doshiyon kii ore se is faisle ko chunauti die jane ke baad hycourt ne naroda paatia maamle main bhi 28 july ko sunwaayee shuru kar di he
 Setalvad's organization Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) is the co-petitioner in this case

 tennis main aakiri baar arjuna puraskaar 2011 main somdev devvarman ko mila tha
 The name of a player like Rohan Bopanna has not been able to get ahead of the selection committee many times, but this time the doors of success and fame are seen opening for Rohan Bopanna after becoming the mixed doubles champion in the French Open
 pichley hafte canada kii gabriela dabrovoski ke saath french open champion bane bopanna lagaataar surkiyon main hai
 If Bopanna met Vijay Goel with the Sports Minister today, then questions were bound to arise that how did Bopanna fall so far in the Arjuna Award race? khel mantri vijay goyal ne kaha, "hamaara kaam he ki ham hunarmand pratibhashali khilaadi ko unka haq dilaaein jiske ve haqadaar hai
 Bopanna's name (arjuna Award) will go before the committee which will select the player's name based on the rules set
 " bopanna ne bhi kaha, "kuch maheenon main hi pataa chal jaayegaa ki mujhe khel puraskaar milegaa yaa nahin
 If found, it would be a matter of pride for me
 " gauratlab he ki 1961 lekar ab tak sirf 15 tennis khilaadi hi arjuna puraskaar hasil kar sake hai
 Many players like Bopanna are not included in this list among some important names like Ramanathan Krishnan (1961), Vijay Amritraj (1974), Leander Paes (1990), Mahesh Bhupathi (1995), Sania Mirza (2004) and Somdev Devvarman (2011) Possible yahi nahin tennis se abtak sirf do khilaadiyon- liender pes (1996-97) or sania mirza (2015) ko hi khel ratna puraskaar mil chukaa he
 There have also been disputes over this
 tippaniyan Bopanna has won 16 ATP titles
 lekin 2003 main pro bane rohan hameshaa liender pes, mahesh bhupati yaa sania mirza kii shoharat ke saaye main hi nazar aae
 This time again his name has been sent for the Arjuna Award from the Tennis Federation

 The journey from the first round of the French Open in 2008 to becoming the champion in 2017 has not been easy for Bopanna
 clay court, is saal grand slam kitaab jeetne vaale iklaute bhartiya khilaadi bopanna kaa pasandida sarfes nahin he
 But his relentless hard work finally paid off and he managed to join the elite group by winning the Bopanna Grand Slam title in the second innings of his career
 bopanna kehete hai, "is baar clay court par main acchhee taiyaari ke saath gaya
 Winning the title with Pablo Kuevos in Montecarlo gave me a lot of confidence
 hamane mens dubles or mixd dubles main acchhee shuruyaat kii
 Playing several tournaments together made our team good, which led to the title win with Dabrovsky
 " bopanna kaa kahana he ki umr kaa asar unhone apane khel par nahin padane diya he or wo aage or bhi grand slam kitaab kii ummid karne lage hai
 Sports Minister Vijay Goel said, "our job is to get talented talented sportspersons to get their rights which they deserve
 bopanna kaa naam (arjuna puraskaar) cameti ke saamne jayega jo tay niyamon ke aadhaar par khilaadi kaa naam chayan karegi
 "bopanna also said," In a few months it will be known whether i will get the sports award or not
 agar milegaa to mere liye fair kii baat hogi
 "significantly, since 1961, only 15 tennis players have been able to receive the Arjuna Award
 ramanathan krishnan (1961), vijay amritraj (1974), liender pes (1990), mahesh bhupati (1995), sania mirza (2004) or somdev devvarman (2011) jaise kuch ahm naamon ke bich bopanna jaise kai khilaadi is list main shaamil nahin ho sake
 Not only this, only two players - Leander Paes (1996‚Äì97) and Sania Mirza (2015) - have received the Khel Ratna Award from tennis
 ise lekar vivaad bhi hote rahe hai
 The comments bopanna ne ATP ke 16 kitaab apane naam kiye hai
 But Rohan, who turned pro in 2003, always appeared in the shadow of Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi or Sania Mirza's fame
 is baar phir tennis federation kii ore se unka naam arjuna puraskaar ke liye bheja gaya he

 After Uttarakhand, the Supreme Court has now canceled the decision to impose President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh
 raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main uttarakhand kaa faisla bharat ke nyaayik or raajnneetik itihaas kaa pehla faisla he jo nai sarkaar ke banane se pehle aayaa he
 The first such example is from Pakistan only when the sacked government of Nawaz Sharif was reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1993
 1994 main esaaar bommai faisle kaa hawala har raashtrapati shashan ke samay diya jaataa he magar jab kai saal baad faisla aayaa tha to usase pehle karnataka main kisi or kii sarkaar ban chuki thi
 The government of SR Bommai was sacked in 1989
 itihaas kii vidambnaa dekhie
 On the basis of the Bommai verdict which was said to be a lesson for the disgraced Congress for imposing President's rule, within two months two Congress governments have got freedom from President's rule
 aaie arunachal main raashtrapati shashan lagu hone kii kahani shuru se shuru karte hai
 On the 26th of January this year, as you were celebrating the implementation of the Constitution in the country, you were filling your house by buying goods at super discounts in super markets, in a room in the 340-room Rashtrapati Bhawan on Raisina Hills
 Pranab Mukherjee was signing the proposal which was sent by the Union Cabinet that President's rule should be imposed in Arunachal
 media kii khabaron ke mutabik 26 janvari kii shaam raashtrapati bhawan se mehmaanon ke jate hi raashtrapati ne centre ke is prastaav par dastakhat kar diya tha
 On January 26, at 7:30 pm, the information of the Press Information Bureau comes that President's rule has been implemented in Arunachal Pradesh
 bataaya jaataa he ki 24 janvari ko cabinet ne apni baithak main raashtrapati shashan kii anushansa kii thi
 The decision to impose President's rule on 26 January should have been knocked off due to the date, but no one was knocked
 uttarakhand kii tarah arunachal pradesh ko lekar koi khaas hangaamaa nahin hua
 Probably also because the media must have become normal due to more than 100 instances of imposition of President's rule
 is kaaran ho saktaa he ki 27 janvari ke akhabaaron main arunachal main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii surkhiyaan bahut badi nahin thim
 Was on the front page but like normal news
 27 janvari ke din supreme court main is maamle ko suna janaa tha magar 26 taarikh ko raashtrapati ne cabinet ke prastaav par sin kar diya
 The opposition called it a murder of democracy
 supreme court main sunwaayee hoti rahi magar arunachal pradesh main sarkaar bhi ban gai
 Seven months later, the Supreme Court has once again questioned the audacity of political parties in our democracy as to how the leaders of the parties and institutions in the name of their loyalty are still messing with the Constitution even today
 Today's time is said to be much more aware and attentive than in the seventies
 supreme court ke paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne ekarey se faisla dete hue arunachal pradesh main saat maheene puraani congress sarkaar ko behaal kar diya he
 The government is currently running with the support of the BJP
 faisla dene vaale jajon ke naam hai justise jees khehar, justise deepak mishra, justise madan bi lokur, justise pisi ghosh or justise envi ramanna
 At the time of the Uttarakhand case, the Nainital High Court had said that there is no king or president that his decision cannot be reviewed
 duusari baar raashtrapati shashan lagane kaa modi sarkaar kaa faisla adaalat main nahin tik sakaa he
 The government should be told that its motives were wrong or that its legal advisors suggested wrong motives, or that their understanding of the law is crude
 sawaal yah nahin he ki vahaan maujuud sarkaar ke paas bahumat he to uskaa kya hoga
 The question is whether it was lawful to exist
 adaalat ne kaha he ki maujuuda sarkaar avaidh he
 The BJP was now defending the same things for which Congress was criticized
 is maamle main donon iz ikval tu kii hode main hai
 That is, they are becoming the same
 raashtrapati shashan aksar academik charchaa kaa vishay banakar rah jaataa he
 In such cases nobody's morality or accountability is fixed
 isi iz ikval tu ke kaaran
 What is the morality of legislators
 aapane haal hi main rajyasabha ke chunaav main dekhi, bas bhar bharkar vidhayak khuleam five star hotel main tehraae ja rahe hai
 There is no question anywhere
 yah hamaare raajnneetik dalon kii naitikta he or yah he aap matadaataaon kii jaagrukta kaa str
 If the court did not have a watchful eye, imagine how the political parties would have strangled it by chanting democracy
 anjaane main hi sahi bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kapil sibbal ne thik hi kaha he ki sirf nyaaypalika samvidhan ke mulyon kii raksha kar sakati he
 Just the judiciary
 raajnneetik dalon kaa jo ricard he uske hisaab se samvidhan kii raksha sirf nyaaypalika kar sakati he
 The first non-congress Janata government at the Center had sacked 9 Congress governments
 supreme court ne kaha he ki vah ghadi kii sui peeche kar sakati he
 The decisions of the current Legislative Assembly of Arunachal Pradesh have been quashed, but the government which has been running illegally for seven months, will not be punished
 kya itnaa aasaan he ki koi netaa avaidh rup se mukhyamantri ban jaae, rajya ke khajaane se kharch kar de or supreme court ke aadesh ke baad istipha dekar ghar chalaa jaae
 Should not the Chief Minister of the illegal government be a criminal in the eyes of the law
 kya avaidh sarkaar ke mukhyamantri yaa mantri ko pad se hatane ke baad tamaam suvidhaayen milti rahengi
 Should not all the facilities available as former Chief Minister be canceled
 justise khehar ne faisle main kaha ki jab raajnneetik prakriyaaon kii hatya ho rahi ho to court mook darshak bana nahin rah saktaa
 The Supreme Court has said that Governor JP Rajkhowa had acted unconstitutional by calling the assembly meeting on 16 December 2015 even after the due date of 14 January 2016
 adaalat ne rajyapal ke us sandesh ko bhi radd kar diya jo unhone 9 disambar ke rose vidhansabha ko bheja tha
 Said that the Governor cannot decide the agenda of the Assembly
 isliye 9 disambar ke baad vidhansabha ke tamaam faisle avaidh ghoshit ho jate hai
 The Legislative Assembly is restored before 9 December
 yani congress sarkaar waapas apane vajood main aati he
 Usually, in such cases the person who loses says that he respects the verdict but only after reading the verdict will give the right response
 apil karenge
 Those who win do not often have to read a copy of the verdict
 tamaam tarah ke kanoonee salaahkaaron se las centre sarkaar do do baar raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main supreme court main haar jaae, apana bachaav na kar paae, aap us faisle main kya padhanaa chaahate hai
 This decision again underlines the role of governors
 har baar karata he magar kai baar rajyapal sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon kii dhajjiyaan uda dete hai or apane pad par aaraam se bane rahete hai
 They enjoy the pleasure of the royal palace
 arunachal pradesh ke rajyapal ne vidhansabha kii baithak tay taarikh se ek maheenaa pehle bula lee thi
 To this, the Supreme Court said whether this meant that whenever the governor was bored, he could call a session of the assembly to feel enthusiastic
 kya rajyapal kaa faisla thos sanvaidhanik siddhanton par aadhaarit tha yaa phir unki sanak par
 
 
 You can use constitutional discretion only if they are based on a constitutional principle
 yahaan kya sanvaidhanik siddhant tha
 
 
 Is it in your discretionary powers to call the assembly session soon? bijepi faisle ko vicitra bataa rahi he, arunachal ke mukhyamantri kehete hai ki unki sarkaar bani rahegi, khabaren hai ki centre court se phir apil karegaa
 The question is where does the moral accountability of this decision stop
 kiske paas jaakar rukati he
 If he stops with the Prime Minister then why is there no questioning the role of the President
 do-do baar unki manzuri radd hui he
 The court has said that the governor should stay away from the quarrels of political parties
 haal hi main upi ke rajyapal ne mathura, kairana or dadri par centre ko report bheji he
 Political controversy also continues regarding the role of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 supreme court kaa faisla in sandarbhon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The court has said that the notices sent to the President, the information sent every month could be justified on the basis that the President was being informed about the political situation of the state
 lekin yah rajyapal ke adhikaar se baahar he ki vah apni sanvaidhanik sthiti kaa istemaal karte hue in raajnneetik vivaadon ko sulajhane kii koshish kare
 The comments is maamle main rajyapal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki mukhyamantri nabam tuki ne sadan kaa vishwaas kho diya he
 Nor did it state that the Congress lost a majority in the Assembly
 agar aisa hota to rajyapal sadan ke patal par bahumat hasil karne ke aadesh de sakate the
 But the governor himself has said that he never asked for a trust vote
 supreme court ne sawaal poocha he ki kya hamaare desh main kanoon kaa shashan rajyapal ko sanvaidhanik siddhanton or arunachal vidhansabha ke kaamkaaj ke niyamon ko hawa main udaane kii ijazat detaa he
 Every line of this judgment of 331 pages is worth reading
 vaise uttarakhand maamle main bhi rajyapal kii bhoomika par kam tippanee nahin hui thi magar rajyapal kaa kuch nahin hua
 In both the cases, if the Governor remains, then what is the moral meaning of this decision of the Supreme Court
 hamaare desh main rataya jaataa he ki samvidhan hi hamaare liye sarvocch he magar iske ulanghan par koi sazaa kyon nahin he
 Making minor statements and cutting pockets carries a jail sentence, neither moral responsibility nor legal punishment for violation of the constitution
 100 se adhik baar raashtrapati shashan laga he
 In most of the cases the constitution has been violated, yet no political party demands any punishment for violation of the constitution
 kya isliye ki ve jaanate hai
 
 
 If we will play with the constitution, how will we rule? yah he samvidhan se chalane vaale bharat desh main samvidhan ke ulanghan kii sanvaidhanik sthiti

 har baar karata he magar kai baar rajyapal sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon kii dhajjiyaan uda dete hai or apane pad par aaraam se bane rahete hai
 They enjoy the pleasure of the royal palace
 arunachal pradesh ke rajyapal ne vidhansabha kii baithak tay taarikh se ek maheenaa pehle bula lee thi
 To this, the Supreme Court said whether this meant that whenever the governor was bored, he could call a session of the assembly to feel enthusiastic
 kya rajyapal kaa faisla thos sanvaidhanik siddhanton par aadhaarit tha yaa phir unki sanak par
 
 
 You can use constitutional discretion only if they are based on a constitutional principle
 yahaan kya sanvaidhanik siddhant tha
 
 
 Is it in your discretionary powers to call the assembly session soon? bijepi faisle ko vicitra bataa rahi he, arunachal ke mukhyamantri kehete hai ki unki sarkaar bani rahegi, khabaren hai ki centre court se phir apil karegaa
 The question is where does the moral accountability of this decision stop
 kiske paas jaakar rukati he
 If he stops with the Prime Minister then why is there no questioning the role of the President
 do-do baar unki manzuri radd hui he
 The court has said that the governor should stay away from the quarrels of political parties
 haal hi main upi ke rajyapal ne mathura, kairana or dadri par centre ko report bheji he
 Political controversy also continues regarding the role of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 supreme court kaa faisla in sandarbhon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The court has said that the notices sent to the President, the information sent every month could be justified on the basis that the President was being informed about the political situation of the state
 lekin yah rajyapal ke adhikaar se baahar he ki vah apni sanvaidhanik sthiti kaa istemaal karte hue in raajnneetik vivaadon ko sulajhane kii koshish kare
 The comments is maamle main rajyapal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki mukhyamantri nabam tuki ne sadan kaa vishwaas kho diya he
 Nor did it state that the Congress lost a majority in the Assembly
 agar aisa hota to rajyapal sadan ke patal par bahumat hasil karne ke aadesh de sakate the
 But the governor himself has said that he never asked for a trust vote
 supreme court ne sawaal poocha he ki kya hamaare desh main kanoon kaa shashan rajyapal ko sanvaidhanik siddhanton or arunachal vidhansabha ke kaamkaaj ke niyamon ko hawa main udaane kii ijazat detaa he
 Every line of this judgment of 331 pages is worth reading
 vaise uttarakhand maamle main bhi rajyapal kii bhoomika par kam tippanee nahin hui thi magar rajyapal kaa kuch nahin hua
 In both the cases, if the Governor remains, then what is the moral meaning of this decision of the Supreme Court
 hamaare desh main rataya jaataa he ki samvidhan hi hamaare liye sarvocch he magar iske ulanghan par koi sazaa kyon nahin he
 Making minor statements and cutting pockets carries a jail sentence, neither moral responsibility nor legal punishment for violation of the constitution
 100 se adhik baar raashtrapati shashan laga he
 In most of the cases the constitution has been violated, yet no political party demands any punishment for violation of the constitution
 kya isliye ki ve jaanate hai
 
 
 If we will play with the constitution, how will we rule? yah he samvidhan se chalane vaale bharat desh main samvidhan ke ulanghan kii sanvaidhanik sthiti
 Hearing continued in the Supreme Court but a government was also formed in Arunachal Pradesh
 saat maheene baad supreme court ne jo faisla diya he vah ek baar phir se hamaare loktantr main raajnneetik dalon ke dussahason par sawaal uthaata he ki kis tarah partiyaan or unki nishtha ke naam par sansthaaon ke pramukh aaj bhi samvidhan ke saath khilwaad kar le rahe hai jabaki aaj ke samay ko sattar assi ke dashak kii tulana main kahin zyaada jaagruk or chaukas kaha jaataa he
 The Constitution Bench of five judges of the Supreme Court, having given the verdict from Ekarai, restored the seven-month-old Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh
 vahaan is vakt bijepi ke samarthan se sarkaar chal rahi he
 The judges who gave the verdict are Justice JS Khehar, Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice Madan b Lokur, Justice PC Ghosh and Justice NV Ramanna
 uttarakhand maamle ke vakt nainital hoicourt ne kaha tha ki raashtrapati yaa jaj koi raja nahin hai ki unke faisle kii samiksha nahin ho sakati he
 The Modi government's decision to impose President's rule for the second time could not stand in court
 sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki uske iraade hi galat the yaa uske kanoonee salaahkaaron ne galat iraade se suzav die, yaa unki kanoon kii samaj kachi he
 The question is not if the government there has a majority, what will happen to it
 sawaal yah he ki uskaa vajood main aana vaid tha yaa nahin
 The court has said that the current government is illegal
 jin baton ke liye congress kii aalochana hoti thi unheen baton kaa bachaav ab bijepi kar rahi he
 In this case, both are in competition for equal to two
 yani ek jaise hote ja rahe hai
 President's rule is often the subject of academic discussion
 aise maamalon main kisi kii naitikta yaa javabdehi fiks nahin he
 Because of this is equal to vidhayakon kii kya naitikta he
 As you have seen in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, the mlas are being openly accommodated in the Five Star Hotel by filling the bus
 kahin koi sawaal nahin he
 This is the morality of our political parties and this is the level of awareness of you voters
 agar adaalat kii chaukas nigaah na hoti to sochie ki raajnneetik dal loktantr kaa jaap ratate-ratate kaise iskaa galaa ghont dete
 Unknowingly, rightly targeting the BJP, Kapil Sibal has rightly said that only the judiciary can protect the values of the Constitution
 sirf nyaaypalika
 According to the record of political parties, only the judiciary can protect the constitution
 centre main pehali baar bani gaiyr congressi janata sarkaar ne 9 congressi sarkaron ko barkhaast kiya tha
 The Supreme Court has said that it can reverse the needle of the clock
 arunachal pradesh ke maujuuda vidhansabha ke faisle radd kar die gaye hai lekin saat maheene se jo sarkaar avaidh rup se chali rahi he kya use koi sazaa nahin di jaaegi
 Is it so easy that a leader illegally becomes the Chief Minister, spends from the state treasury and resigns and goes home after the Supreme Court order
 kya kanoon kii nazar main avaidh sarkaar kaa mukhyamantri apradhi nahin hona chahie
 Will the Chief Minister or the minister of the illegal government continue to get all the facilities after his removal from office
 kya purv mukhyamantri ke rup main milane vaali tamaam suvidhaayen radd nahin honi chahie
 Justice Khehar said in the judgment that the court cannot remain a silent spectator when political processes are killing
 supreme court ne kaha he ki rajyapal jepi rajkhova ne 14 janvari 2016 kii tay taarikh ke baad bhi 16 disambar 2015 ko vidhansabha kii baithak bulaakar asanvaidhanik kaam kiya tha
 The court also quashed the Governor's message which he had sent to the Assembly on 9 December daily
 kaha ki rajyapal vidhansabha kaa agenda tay nahin kar sakate hai
 Therefore, after 9 December all the decisions of the Legislative Assembly are declared invalid
 9 disambar se pehle kii vidhansabha behaal kii jaati he
 That is, the Congress government comes back into existence
 aamtaur par aise maamalon main jisaki haar hoti he vah yahi kahata he ki faisle kaa sammaan karte hai magar faisla padhane ke baad hi sahi pratikriya denge
 Will appeal jo jeet jate hai, unhen aksar faisle kii kapi padhane kii zarurat nahin hoti
 Equipped with all types of legal advisors, the central government may lose twice in the case of President's rule in the Supreme Court, not be able to defend itself, what do you want to read in that judgment
 yah faisla rajyapalon kii bhoomika ko phir se rekhaankit karata he
 Every time he does, but many times the Governor ruins the constitutional limits and remains comfortable in his office
 rajbhavan kaa sukh bhogate rahete hai
 The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh called the assembly meeting a month before the due date
 is par supreme court ne kaha ki kya iskaa matlab he ki jab bhi rajyapal bor ho jaae to vah utsaah mahasoos karne ke liye vidhansabha kaa satr bula saktaa he
 Was the Governor's decision based on solid constitutional principles or on his whims
 
 
 aap sanvaidhanik vivekadhikaar kaa istemaal tabhi kar sakate hai jab ve kisi sanvaidhanik siddhant par aadhaarit hon
 What constitutional principle was here
 
 
 kya vidhansabha ke satr ko jald bulaanaa aapaki vivekadhin shaktiyon main aata he
 The BJP is calling the verdict bizarre, the Arunachal chief minister says his government will continue, there are reports that the Center will appeal to the court again
 sawaal he ki is faisle kii naitik javaabadari kahaan jaakar rukati he
 Who stops by going to whom
 pradhanmantri ke paas rukati he to raashtrapati kii bhoomika par sawaal kyon nahin ho rahe hai
 His approval has been canceled twice
 court ne kaha he ki rajyapal ko raajnneetik dalon ke jhagade se dur rahanaa chahie
 Recently the Governor of UP has sent a report to the Center on Mathura, Kairana and Dadri
 dilli ke uparajyapal kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi raajnneetik vivaad chalata rahata he
 The decision of the Supreme Court can also be seen in these references
 court ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko bheje notice, har mihane bheje jane vaali suchanaaen is aadhaar par sahi tehrai ja sakati thim ki raashtrapati ko rajya kii raajnneetik sthiti kii jaankaree di ja rahi he
 But it is out of the Governor's authority to use his constitutional position to try to resolve these political disputes
 tippaniyan In this case the Governor never said that Chief Minister Nabam Tuki had lost the confidence of the House
 na hi yah bataaya ki congress ne vidhansabha main bahumat kho diya he
 If that were the case, the Governor could have ordered a majority on the floor of the House
 magar rajyapal ne khud hi bataaya he ki unhone kabhi vishwaas mat pareekshan ke liye nahin kaha
 The Supreme Court has asked the question whether the rule of law in our country allows the Governor to wind up the constitutional principles and rules of functioning of the Arunachal Assembly
 331 pannon ke is faisle kii har line padhane laayak he
 Although there was no comment on the role of the Governor in Uttarakhand case, but nothing happened to the Governor
 donon hi maamalon main rajyapal bane rahe to supreme court ke is faisle kaa naitik matlab kya rah jaataa he
 It is said in our country that the Constitution itself is supreme for us, but why there is no punishment for its violation
 maamuli bayaan dene or jeb kaat lene par jail kii sazaa hoti he, samvidhan ke ulanghan kii na to naitik zimmedaari na kanoonee sazaa
 President's rule has been imposed more than 100 times
 zyaadaatar maamle main samvidhan kaa ulanghan hua he phir bhi koi raajnneetik dal samvidhan ke ulanghan kii kisi sazaa kii maang nahin karata
 Is it because they know? 
 
 samvidhan se khenlege nahin to raaj kaise karenge
 This is the constitutional position of violation of the constitution in the Constitution-driven India

 This is the constitutional position of violation of the constitution in the Constitution-driven India
 supreme court ne kaha he ki vah ghadi kii sui peeche kar sakati he
 The decisions of the current Legislative Assembly of Arunachal Pradesh have been quashed, but the government which has been running illegally for seven months, will not be punished
 kya itnaa aasaan he ki koi netaa avaidh rup se mukhyamantri ban jaae, rajya ke khajaane se kharch kar de or supreme court ke aadesh ke baad istipha dekar ghar chalaa jaae
 Should not the Chief Minister of the illegal government be a criminal in the eyes of the law
 kya avaidh sarkaar ke mukhyamantri yaa mantri ko pad se hatane ke baad tamaam suvidhaayen milti rahengi
 Should not all the facilities available as former Chief Minister be canceled
 justise khehar ne faisle main kaha ki jab raajnneetik prakriyaaon kii hatya ho rahi ho to court mook darshak bana nahin rah saktaa
 The Supreme Court has said that Governor JP Rajkhowa had acted unconstitutional by calling the assembly meeting on 16 December 2015 even after the due date of 14 January 2016
 adaalat ne rajyapal ke us sandesh ko bhi radd kar diya jo unhone 9 disambar ke rose vidhansabha ko bheja tha
 Said that the Governor cannot decide the agenda of the Assembly
 isliye 9 disambar ke baad vidhansabha ke tamaam faisle avaidh ghoshit ho jate hai
 The Legislative Assembly is restored before 9 December
 yani congress sarkaar waapas apane vajood main aati he
 Usually, in such cases the person who loses says that he respects the verdict but only after reading the verdict will give the right response
 apil karenge
 Those who win do not often have to read a copy of the verdict
 tamaam tarah ke kanoonee salaahkaaron se las centre sarkaar do do baar raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main supreme court main haar jaae, apana bachaav na kar paae, aap us faisle main kya padhanaa chaahate hai
 This decision again underlines the role of governors
 har baar karata he magar kai baar rajyapal sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon kii dhajjiyaan uda dete hai or apane pad par aaraam se bane rahete hai
 They enjoy the pleasure of the royal palace
 arunachal pradesh ke rajyapal ne vidhansabha kii baithak tay taarikh se ek maheenaa pehle bula lee thi
 To this, the Supreme Court said whether this meant that whenever the governor was bored, he could call a session of the assembly to feel enthusiastic
 kya rajyapal kaa faisla thos sanvaidhanik siddhanton par aadhaarit tha yaa phir unki sanak par
 
 
 You can use constitutional discretion only if they are based on a constitutional principle
 yahaan kya sanvaidhanik siddhant tha
 
 
 Is it in your discretionary powers to call the assembly session soon? bijepi faisle ko vicitra bataa rahi he, arunachal ke mukhyamantri kehete hai ki unki sarkaar bani rahegi, khabaren hai ki centre court se phir apil karegaa
 The question is where does the moral accountability of this decision stop
 kiske paas jaakar rukati he
 If he stops with the Prime Minister then why is there no questioning the role of the President
 do-do baar unki manzuri radd hui he
 The court has said that the governor should stay away from the quarrels of political parties
 haal hi main upi ke rajyapal ne mathura, kairana or dadri par centre ko report bheji he
 Political controversy also continues regarding the role of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 supreme court kaa faisla in sandarbhon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The court has said that the notices sent to the President, the information sent every month could be justified on the basis that the President was being informed about the political situation of the state
 lekin yah rajyapal ke adhikaar se baahar he ki vah apni sanvaidhanik sthiti kaa istemaal karte hue in raajnneetik vivaadon ko sulajhane kii koshish kare
 The comments is maamle main rajyapal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki mukhyamantri nabam tuki ne sadan kaa vishwaas kho diya he
 Nor did it state that the Congress lost a majority in the Assembly
 agar aisa hota to rajyapal sadan ke patal par bahumat hasil karne ke aadesh de sakate the
 But the governor himself has said that he never asked for a trust vote
 supreme court ne sawaal poocha he ki kya hamaare desh main kanoon kaa shashan rajyapal ko sanvaidhanik siddhanton or arunachal vidhansabha ke kaamkaaj ke niyamon ko hawa main udaane kii ijazat detaa he
 Every line of this judgment of 331 pages is worth reading
 vaise uttarakhand maamle main bhi rajyapal kii bhoomika par kam tippanee nahin hui thi magar rajyapal kaa kuch nahin hua
 In both the cases, if the Governor remains, then what is the moral meaning of this decision of the Supreme Court
 hamaare desh main rataya jaataa he ki samvidhan hi hamaare liye sarvocch he magar iske ulanghan par koi sazaa kyon nahin he
 Making minor statements and cutting pockets carries a jail sentence, neither moral responsibility nor legal punishment for violation of the constitution
 100 se adhik baar raashtrapati shashan laga he
 In most of the cases the constitution has been violated, yet no political party demands any punishment for violation of the constitution
 kya isliye ki ve jaanate hai
 
 
 If we will play with the constitution, how will we rule? yah he samvidhan se chalane vaale bharat desh main samvidhan ke ulanghan kii sanvaidhanik sthiti
 The Supreme Court has said that Governor JP Rajkhowa had acted unconstitutional by calling the assembly meeting on 16 December 2015 even after the due date of 14 January 2016
 adaalat ne rajyapal ke us sandesh ko bhi radd kar diya jo unhone 9 disambar ke rose vidhansabha ko bheja tha
 Said that the Governor cannot decide the agenda of the Assembly
 isliye 9 disambar ke baad vidhansabha ke tamaam faisle avaidh ghoshit ho jate hai
 The Legislative Assembly is restored before 9 December
 yani congress sarkaar waapas apane vajood main aati he
 Usually, in such cases the person who loses says that he respects the verdict but only after reading the verdict will give the right response
 apil karenge
 Those who win do not often have to read a copy of the verdict
 tamaam tarah ke kanoonee salaahkaaron se las centre sarkaar do do baar raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main supreme court main haar jaae, apana bachaav na kar paae, aap us faisle main kya padhanaa chaahate hai
 This decision again underlines the role of governors
 har baar karata he magar kai baar rajyapal sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon kii dhajjiyaan uda dete hai or apane pad par aaraam se bane rahete hai
 They enjoy the pleasure of the royal palace
 arunachal pradesh ke rajyapal ne vidhansabha kii baithak tay taarikh se ek maheenaa pehle bula lee thi
 To this, the Supreme Court said whether this meant that whenever the governor was bored, he could call a session of the assembly to feel enthusiastic
 kya rajyapal kaa faisla thos sanvaidhanik siddhanton par aadhaarit tha yaa phir unki sanak par
 
 
 You can use constitutional discretion only if they are based on a constitutional principle
 yahaan kya sanvaidhanik siddhant tha
 
 
 Is it in your discretionary powers to call the assembly session soon? bijepi faisle ko vicitra bataa rahi he, arunachal ke mukhyamantri kehete hai ki unki sarkaar bani rahegi, khabaren hai ki centre court se phir apil karegaa
 The question is where does the moral accountability of this decision stop
 kiske paas jaakar rukati he
 If he stops with the Prime Minister then why is there no questioning the role of the President
 do-do baar unki manzuri radd hui he
 The court has said that the governor should stay away from the quarrels of political parties
 haal hi main upi ke rajyapal ne mathura, kairana or dadri par centre ko report bheji he
 Political controversy also continues regarding the role of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 supreme court kaa faisla in sandarbhon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The court has said that the notices sent to the President, the information sent every month could be justified on the basis that the President was being informed about the political situation of the state
 lekin yah rajyapal ke adhikaar se baahar he ki vah apni sanvaidhanik sthiti kaa istemaal karte hue in raajnneetik vivaadon ko sulajhane kii koshish kare
 The comments is maamle main rajyapal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki mukhyamantri nabam tuki ne sadan kaa vishwaas kho diya he
 Nor did it state that the Congress lost a majority in the Assembly
 agar aisa hota to rajyapal sadan ke patal par bahumat hasil karne ke aadesh de sakate the
 But the governor himself has said that he never asked for a trust vote
 supreme court ne sawaal poocha he ki kya hamaare desh main kanoon kaa shashan rajyapal ko sanvaidhanik siddhanton or arunachal vidhansabha ke kaamkaaj ke niyamon ko hawa main udaane kii ijazat detaa he
 Every line of this judgment of 331 pages is worth reading
 vaise uttarakhand maamle main bhi rajyapal kii bhoomika par kam tippanee nahin hui thi magar rajyapal kaa kuch nahin hua
 In both the cases, if the Governor remains, then what is the moral meaning of this decision of the Supreme Court
 hamaare desh main rataya jaataa he ki samvidhan hi hamaare liye sarvocch he magar iske ulanghan par koi sazaa kyon nahin he
 Making minor statements and cutting pockets carries a jail sentence, neither moral responsibility nor legal punishment for violation of the constitution
 100 se adhik baar raashtrapati shashan laga he
 In most of the cases the constitution has been violated, yet no political party demands any punishment for violation of the constitution

 If we will play with the constitution, how will we rule? yah he samvidhan se chalane vaale bharat desh main samvidhan ke ulanghan kii sanvaidhanik sthiti
 The BJP is calling the verdict bizarre, the Arunachal chief minister says his government will continue, there are reports that the Center will appeal to the court again
 sawaal he ki is faisle kii naitik javaabadari kahaan jaakar rukati he
 Who stops by going to whom
 pradhanmantri ke paas rukati he to raashtrapati kii bhoomika par sawaal kyon nahin ho rahe hai
 His approval has been canceled twice
 court ne kaha he ki rajyapal ko raajnneetik dalon ke jhagade se dur rahanaa chahie
 Recently the Governor of UP has sent a report to the Center on Mathura, Kairana and Dadri
 dilli ke uparajyapal kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi raajnneetik vivaad chalata rahata he
 The decision of the Supreme Court can also be seen in these references
 court ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko bheje notice, har mihane bheje jane vaali suchanaaen is aadhaar par sahi tehrai ja sakati thim ki raashtrapati ko rajya kii raajnneetik sthiti kii jaankaree di ja rahi he
 But it is out of the Governor's authority to use his constitutional position to try to resolve these political disputes
 tippaniyan In this case the Governor never said that Chief Minister Nabam Tuki had lost the confidence of the House
 na hi yah bataaya ki congress ne vidhansabha main bahumat kho diya he
 If that were the case, the Governor could have ordered a majority on the floor of the House
 magar rajyapal ne khud hi bataaya he ki unhone kabhi vishwaas mat pareekshan ke liye nahin kaha
 The Supreme Court has asked the question whether the rule of law in our country allows the Governor to wind up the constitutional principles and rules of functioning of the Arunachal Assembly
 331 pannon ke is faisle kii har line padhane laayak he
 Although there was no comment on the role of the Governor in Uttarakhand case, but nothing happened to the Governor
 donon hi maamalon main rajyapal bane rahe to supreme court ke is faisle kaa naitik matlab kya rah jaataa he
 It is said in our country that the Constitution itself is supreme for us, but why there is no punishment for its violation
 maamuli bayaan dene or jeb kaat lene par jail kii sazaa hoti he, samvidhan ke ulanghan kii na to naitik zimmedaari na kanoonee sazaa
 President's rule has been imposed more than 100 times
 zyaadaatar maamle main samvidhan kaa ulanghan hua he phir bhi koi raajnneetik dal samvidhan ke ulanghan kii kisi sazaa kii maang nahin karata
 Is it because they know? 
 
 samvidhan se khenlege nahin to raaj kaise karenge
 This is the constitutional position of violation of the constitution in the Constitution-driven India
 is maamle main rajyapal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki mukhyamantri nabam tuki ne sadan kaa vishwaas kho diya he
 Nor did it state that the Congress lost a majority in the Assembly

 China is making inflammatory statements against India, emboldened by a week-long visit of the Tibetan spiritual guru Dalai Lama to Arunachal
 buudhvaar ko china ne kaha ki arunachal pradesh bharat main hi nahin he balki vivaadit border kaa ek ilaaka he
 Earlier China also said that the people of Arunachal are troubled by the wrong laws of India and want to come to Beijing
 jabaki bharat ne baar-baar kaha he ki dalai lamas kii yatra ek dharmik yatra thi or is maamle ko china ko tool nahin dena chahie
 Let's see how China's statements about Tibet and Arunachal changed and the relationship between these two superpowers of Asia grew stronger
 kya he vivaad?bharat or china ke bich vivaad 4 hajaar kimi kii seemaa ko lekar he jo ki nirdhaarit nahin he
 This is called LAC
 bharat or china ke sainikon kaa jahaan tak kabja he vahi niyantran rekha he
 Which was decided by mcmahon in 1914, but does not consider it as China and so often he tries to infiltrate
 arunachal ko china apana hissaa bataata he jabaki vah bharat kaa hissaa he
 India has been opposing China's intervention in this
 ise lekar donon deshon main dashakon se tanaav he or 1962 main jang bhi ho chuki he
 However, not a single shot has been fired on the indo-china border after that
 china ke vivaadit bayaan--china arunachal par apana daawa jataata he or isiilie arunachal ko vivaadit bataane ke liye hi china vahaan ke nivaasiyon ko stepal vija detaa he jiskaa bharat virodh karata he
 Bumla Pass, located in Tawang, opened for business in 2006 after 44 years
 donon taraf ke vyapaariyon ko ek duusare ke kshetra main pravesh karne kii anumati di gai
 - In January 2011, China said that Arunachal is a part of Tibet
 iske baad usne arunachal pradesh ke do khilaadiyon ko china ne bhartiya passport par vija nahin diya
 The players were given stapled visas, in which Arunachal was called Southern Tibet
 14 baar ho chuki he batseema vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye nai dilli or beijing ke bich ab tak 14 baar vaarta bhi ho chuki he
 But they have proved to be uninteresting
 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt pradhanmantri manmohan singh prachaar ke liye arunachal pradesh gaye the
 China had openly criticized Manmohan's visit
 bharat kaa do took jawabehaal main dalai lamas kii arunachal yatra ko lekar jab china ne phir hangaamaa kiya to bharat ne do took jawaab diya or kaha ki arunachal bharat kaa andruni maamla he or bevajaah vivaad khadaa na kare china
 Chinese media has targeted Modi, leading newspaper Global Times wrote that Narendra Modi has a different attitude towards Dalai Lama than former Prime Ministers
 vah china ke liye chunauti pesh kar rahe hai

 Kangaroo all-rounder Steve Smith took an 'unusual' catch of Pakistani batsman Fawad Alam behind the wickets

 What happened in the 18th over! It was the 18th over of the Pakistani innings
 gend jevier doharty ke haath main thi
 Fable Alam was the batsman at the crease
 first slip main steve smith khadey the
 As Doherty bowled the ball, Smith guessed that Fawad would play the sweep shot and he ran towards the leg slip, already past the wicketkeeper
 alam ne sweep khilne kii koshish kii, gend ne balle kaa kinaaraa liya or smith ne ek aasaan sa kaich le liya
 The two on-field umpires discussed each other and declared Fawad out
 fawaad match adhikari se spashtikaran kii ummid lagaae kaaphi samay tak boundry line par khadey rahe or phir jhallaakar boundry line par balla patakate hue pavilion laut gaye
 What are the rules? If this catch was taken before this series, then it was more likely to not be given out
 niyamon ke mutabik, gend phenke jane or khele jane se pehle tak kisi fielder kaa apni pojishan main 'bada' badlaav karnaa nazaij he
 However a recent amendment interprets the match differently
 iske mutabik, agar ballebaaj gend khilne ke liye pojishan lenaa shuru kar chukaa he to fielder move karnaa shuru kar saktaa he
 Although this amendment is yet to be included in the book of cricket, it has been included in the 2014-15 book of match officials

 India said on Wednesday that foreign minister-level talks with Pakistan should not be taken as a resumption of mutual dialogue as it is only a measure of confidence-building between the two countries
 videsh mantri es em krishna ne kaha, ‚Äòagar aap thimpu vishay ko dekhen to vaarta jaisi koi baat nahin he
 Negotiations between foreign ministers and foreign secretaries are only a measure of confidence building
 yahi hamaari vaarta kaa mukhya aadhaar he‚Äô
 Krishna said that the main point of his talks with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi would be to find ways to end the mistrust between the two countries
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòyah shuruyaat he or agar ham kisi saajhe dharaatal par pahunche to anya mukhya muddon par vaarta hogi‚Äô
 Regarding Home Minister p Chidambaram's visit to Pakistan before him, Krishna said that the foreign ministers' talks would proceed based on their assessment of the situation
 krishna ne kaha, ‚Äògrih mantri mujhase pehle ja rahe hai or vah pakistani netritv se mulaakaat karne ja rahe hai or pakistani nagarikon dwaara pakistan kii dharti se bharat ke khilaaf jari aatankwaadi gatividhiyon se sambandhit ekatra saare aankade unke samaksh rakhenge‚Äô
 Krishna said, 'I am confident that he will present India's case and then we will see what the response from Pakistan is and then he will come back and convey his assessment and on that basis our dialogue will proceed'
 unhone kaha ki jab tak aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai nahin hoti, sarkaar ke str par chijen waisi hi rahengi
 Krishna said, "unless action is taken against terrorism, i may go to Islamabad, Foreign Minister Qureshi should come to Delhi, at the government level, i am afraid that things will remain the same"
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòham aatankwaad par badi uplabdhi hasil karnaa chaahate hai‚Äô
 Asked whether he had mentioned changes in indo-pak relations in Parliament, the minister said that he meant a new beginning was to be made for which both countries should be prepared
 krishna ne kaha, ‚Äòjab maine badlaav kii baat kahi to meraa matlab tha ki nai shuruyaat kii jaani he or us nayi shuruyaat ke liye donon deshon ko taiyaar rahanaa chahie

 ek shaks par apane hi pados main rahane vaali ek maasoom bacchee ke sathbalaatkaaraka iljaam he
 The incident is from Amalsad village in Navsari district of Gujarat
 talab kinare aaropee ko barbar tareeke se maut ke ghat utaare jane kii yah vaardaat dil dahalane vaali he
 a man named Mangal Sukha Halapathi, surrounded by accusations of having a child with a child, climbed into the hands of the crowd
 isse pehle ki police use giraftaar karti, uske khilaaf koi mukadmaa chalaaya jaataa, insaaf kii adaalat main use gunaahagaar tehraaya jaataa, bheed ne apane hi kaayade-kanoonon ke mutabik use gunahagaar bhi tehra diya or maut kii sajaa bhi de di
 In fact, Mangal Sukha was accused of raping a 2-year-old girl living in a drunken neighborhood
 maasoom bacchee kii rone kii aawaaj sunakar maukey par pahunchi mahilaon nebacchee kii halatadekhane ke baad mangal ko peetna shuru kar diya
 To avoid killing the women, the accused jumped into the village pond but by then the entire village had gathered there
 iske baad logon ne mangal sukha ko talab se baahar nikaala or use petakar adhamra kar diya
 The mob attacked the accused with all weapons including lathi-poles and kick-punches
 dekhte hi dekhte vah adhamra hokar jameen par gir gaya
 The anger of the people still did not subside and they kept beating him but nobody tried to save him
 puraa gaanv maut kaa yah tamaasha dekhtaa rahaa
 Police arrived on the spot and rescued the accused from Navsari Civil Hospital where doctors declared him dead after examination
 sawaal aakhir vahi he ki kya aise kisi ko bhi saream peet-peet kar mrityudand diya ja saktaa he? aaazaad hindustan ke itihaas main aisa shaayad hi pehle kabhi hua ho, jab kisi mulgim ko jail se nikaal kar bheed ne maut ke ghat utaar diya ho
 But it also happened in Dimapur, Nagaland
 yahaan rape ke iljaam main ek shaks ko bheed ne naa sirf jail se nikaal kar peeta, balki use saream chauraahey par faansee de di
 When he could not live even then he burnt it alive
 desh ke uttar purvi hisse par based soobe nagaland ke shahar dimapur main 5 march ko jo kuch hua
 He suddenly forced the whole country to question these questions
 nagaland kechatro ne rape ke iljaamme giraftaar ek shaks ko ek aisi ajeeb or bhayanak maut di, ki agar yah manjar iesas or taliban ke aatankwaadiyon ne dekha hota shaayad unhen bhi is baat kaa itmeenaan ho jaataa ki aisi kabilai soch ko jeene vaale duniya main ek vahi akele nahin hai
 In fact, Syed Farid Khan, a second-hand car dealer from Dimapur, was arrested by the police on 25 February on charges of raping a Naga student for several consecutive days
 isse pehle ki police uske khilaaf koi subut pesh karti, gavaah apni baat rakhte, adaalat uski sajaa mukarrar karata
 Angry young men themselves brutally punished him with their own hands
 rape kii is vaardaat se gussaye takreeban 10 hajaar chaatro or naujavaanon ne sidhe dimapur ke district jail par hi dhaava bol diya or ek-ek kar jail ke do phatakon ko tod kar andar daakhil ho gaye
 What was it then, the jail staff on the fist stood in the corner watching all the spectacle and a crowd of thousands kidnapped this accused in front of everyone
 is mulgim ko uske tathakthith gunaah kii sajaa dene ke liye bheed use maarthe-peetate or ghasitate hue dimapur ke chowk par le ai
 By then, all his clothes were torn and then he was dragged along the ropes in absolutely naked condition on the streets
 is dauraan sir phire naujavaanon kii toli is bhayanak manjar ke har pahalu ko camere main kaid karti rahi
 When vojulmo-sitam went through this process and became completely insensitive, he was hanged at Dimapur Chowk with a noose
 ant main use isi haal main jinda jala diya gaya
 The most worrying thing is that in front of this crowd and this thinking, all the rules, laws, police and security arrangements have all become small
 jinpulisavalone in ladakon ko rokane kii koshish kii, unhen bhi lahooluhaan ho kar raste se hatana padaa
 When everything calmed down, the Dimapur administration first announced the imposition of curfew and section 144

27st PST bihar main jithan ram maanjhi sarkaar ne mantriyon ko hitech banane ke liye bhale hi unhen computer kii training dene kii yojana banaai ho, lekin yah unhen raas nahin aa rahaa
 The number of ministers in computer training held in Patna was very less
 32 mantriyon main se sirf nau mantri hi is training program main hissaa lene pahunche
 Four of these ministers left with Chief Minister Manjhi after the inauguration of the program
 bihar sarkaar ke soochna praudyogiki vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki vibhaag ke nirdesh par rashtriya electronic va soochna praudyogiki santhaan kii ore se buudhvaar ko mantriyon ko computer kii training dene ke liye kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 All 32 ministers of the state were to participate in the program, but only nine ministers arrived to gain knowledge of computers
 sutron kaa kahana he ki ek mantri ko chhodkar kisi anya mantri ne laptop tak pahunchane kii koshish tak nahin kii, jabaki centre teble par laptop ke saath prashikshak maujuud the
 However, Chief Minister Manjhi considered this training very important for himself
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'main technical person nahin hum
 If anyone in Bihar government needs it the most, it is me
 'training program kaa udghaatan karte hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki takneekee or soochna praudyogiki ke gyaan kii jarurat lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Any level of office bearers or employees or people from political field, everyone should have knowledge of computer, laptop, internet
 aaj bina soochna praudyogiki ke sahyog ke ham vikaas ke lakshya ko nahin paa sakate hai
 Manjhi expressed happiness that in wi-fi we have developed more than other states and have surpassed other states
 is maukey par soochna va praudyogiki mantri shahid ali khan ne kaha ki computer kaarykram se bihar ko nai disha milegi
 People will know how much information technology is needed
 unhone kaha ki ab sakshartaa kii paribhaasha badali he
 Now the literate can say that only one who has knowledge of computer, internet also
 unhone kaha ki vibhaag kii ore se duusari baar mantriyon ke liye prashikshan kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya he

 IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi revealed this
 lalit modi ko indian premier lig se haal main jude randeyu sport world (aresadablyoo) ke maalikon kii suchi twitor par jari karnaa mahangaa pad saktaa he ki kyonki team kochi ke maalikon ne gopneeyata kii sharton kaa ulanghan karne ke liye ipel ayukta ke khilaaf mukadmaa thokane kii dhamkee di he
 Modi has revealed the names of people who took part in Randeu who bought the Kochi franchise for about Rs 1533 crore
 modi ke is kadam se videsh rajyamantri shashi tharur behad khafa hai kyonki is suchi main sunanda pushkar kaa bhi naam he jinase reporton ke anusaar vah shaadi karne vaale hai
 Angered by the revelation, Randeu threatened to send a legal notice to Modi and accused the IPL commissioner of breaching the terms of confidentiality
 kochi frenchiji ne is sambandh main bisisiai adhyaksh shashaank manohar se bhi shikaayat kii he
 Modi wrote on his Twitter page that those who are partners in the Kochi franchise include Kisan Shailender and Pushpa Gaikwad, Sunanda Pushkar, Pooja Gulati, Jayant Kotalwar, Vishnu Prasad and Sandeep Aggarwal
 media reporton ne kaha ki tharur ne kashmiri ladki sunanda pushkar ke saamne shaadi kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 She is a beautician and runs a spa in Dubai
 modi ne likhaa he, ‚Äòkochi team ke hissedaaron or usase sambandhit kai baaten kii ja rahi thi
 i will be preparing the note soon and will release the official release shortly
 ‚Äô ipel pramukh ne sanket diye ki un par randeyu se jude logon ke naamon kaa khulaasa nahin karne kaa dabaav tha
 Tharoor may get into a new controversy with this disclosure
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòmujhase yah nahin bataane ke liye kaha gaya tha ki randeyu main kiskaa hissaa he visheshkar sunanda pushkar ke bare main
 With this tweet by Modi, Tharoor may get into a new controversy as the Union minister claimed that he has no share in the Kochi franchise
 tharur ne tiimon kii nilaamee ke baad kaha tha, ‚Äòmaine jarurat padane par boli lagane waalon ko apni visheshgy raay or duaen di
 Apart from this, i have no role in it
 yah bijness se jude logon kaa samooh he or main samajhataa hum ki yah bijness se judaa faisla hi he
 'randeu reacted strongly to Modi's revelations and even then he did not agree that Sunanda has 18 per cent share in the franchise
 sutron ke anusaar kochi frenchiji chaahati he ki modi anya frenchiji jaise ki rajasthan rails or kings ilevan punjab ke hissedaaron ke hisse kaa bhi khulaasa karen
 Sources in Randeu said that Modi wanted the Ahmedabad team for the forthcoming IPL sessions and hence Kochi is creating problems for the team

 lambii chali kanoonee ladaai ke baad unhone 88 saal kii umr main duusari shaadi kii
 Known for his colorful mood in his younger days, ND Tiwariko faced the toughest phase in the late 80s of his life when a young man named Rohit Shekhar gave paternity against Tiwari and considered him his biological father
 court ne iske liye tiwari kadienesample test lene kaa aadesh diya jiske liye kaaphi naanukoor karne ke baad unhen yah sample dena padaa
 Tiwari's first meeting with Ujjwala Sharma was about 50 years ago
 1968 main hui thi pehali mulaqatarohit shekhar kii maa ujjwala sharma kii tiwari se pehali mulaakaat 1968 main apanepita ke ghar 3, krishna menon margpar hui thi tab vah umr ke tisare dashak main thim
 At that time, Tiwari was the president of the Youth Congress
 ujjwala ke pita pro
 Sher Singh was the Deputy Minister of Pratap Singh Kairon in the undivided Punjab during his tenure as Chief Minister
 1967-80 main ve shiksha or raksha utpaadan mantralay main kendriya mantri bane
 When Ujjwala and her husband BL Sharma decided to separate, the elder son Siddharth had arrived in her womb
 jaisaa ki ve kahati hai, 'mere or sharma ji (pati biel sharma) ke bich bahut saamanjasy nahin tha isliye hamane alag hone kaa faisla kiya
 'when she met Tiwari, she taught Sanskrit in Delhi University
 yah najuk yuva ladki tiwari kii nigaah main aa gai
 Ujjwala recalls her gaze firmly on the floor carpet, 'slowly we got introduced and started courting her
 '' unhone kaha, ''tum ekaaki jivan ji rahi ho
 "she says with simplistic dignity," i finally agreed to have an intimate relationship with him in 1977, which he had been trying for the past 6-7 years
 '2008 main saamne aayaa maamalamaamle kii shuruyaat 2008 main hui jab endi tiwari ke khilaaf rohit pehali baar adaalat kii sharan main gaye jahaan unhone daawa kiya ki wo purv congress netaa or apni maa ujjwala sharma ke putr hai
 Tiwari pleaded in the court to dismiss the case in Dillihai Court but it was dismissed in March 2010
 hoicourt ne 23 disambar, 2010 ko is daawey kii sachai kaa pataa lagane ke liye diene test karaane kaa aadesh diya
 However, he was not easily persuaded for this
 supreme court main bhi unhone isaki guhaar lagaai jahaan se unhen niraashaa haath lagi
 ND Tiwari had to give his blood for a DNA test on 29 May 2011 following strictness of the court
 is diene jaanch kii report 27 july 2012 ko dilli hoicourt main kholi gai
 But an appeal was also filed in the court on behalf of Tiwari not to make the report public, but the court did not accept his appeal and the report revealed that Tiwari is Rohit's biological father and Ujjwala is the biological mother
 khaas baat yah he ki jab tiwari diene test dene se kataraa gaye to rohit ke kanoonee pita biel sharma apana diene sample 2010 main adaalat main dene ko taiyaar ho gaye
 While Ujjwala was already divorced from Sharma
 test ke nattejey se pramanit ho gaya ki ve rohit ke pita nahin hai
 In 2104, Rohit was considered by Betacourt, after Rohit was considered the biological father of ND Tiwari, he requested the media to maintain his privacy in this matter
 6 saal chale pitrutv cese haarane ke baad 3 march, 2014 ko narayan dutt tiwari ne rohit shekhar ko apana betaa sweekaar kar liya
 Then he said, 'I have accepted that Rohit Shekhar is my son
 diene report ne bhi yah sabit kiya he ki wo meraa jaivik betaa he
 To this his son Rohit also responded, 'I am shocked that ND Tiwari has finally accepted me as his son
 ‚Äô88 saal kii umr main kii shadilekin yah bhi digar he ki unhone rohit ko apana betaa tab mana jab hoicourt kii ore se madhyasthata kii guzarish khaarij kar di gai
 At the same time, Rohit's mother Ujjwala Sharma also rejected the request for arbitration in this case, saying that it is not a matter related to his property but only that Rohit is his son
 ujjwala sharma ne kaha, ‚Äòdiene repart ne yah sabit kar diya tha ki wo hi rohit ke pita hai
 He could only find a middle ground on this but he went to court
 ‚Äôdiene report aane ke 2 saal ke andar 14 may, 2014 ko endi tiwari ne lakhanu main rohit kii maa ujjwala ke saath shaadi kar lee
 He was 88 years old at the time of marriage

 sawaal uth rahe hai ki yadi rajya nivesh ke liye itnaa hi upyukt he to aakhir desh kaa vaarshik jidipi aankada kyon is nivesh ko nahin darsha rahaa? kahin aisa to nahin ki nivesh ke naam par chunaav main maahaul banane bhar ke liye ye kavayad kii ja rahi he?uttar pradesh main rajya sarkaar ne ‚Äòground braking‚Äô kaarykram karte hue pradhanmantri va desh ke kareeb sau bade udyogpatiyon ko 6 maheene ke andar duusari baar ek manch par khadaa kar diya
 Where in February, these industrialists signed 1,045 Memorandum of Understanding with the state government in the presence of top ministers including the prime minister and their entire cabinet including the chief minister from the state
 aaj 6 maheene bitne ke baad ek baar phir ye udyogpati us manch par pahunchakar 60,000 karod rupee ke nivesh kii aadharshila rakh rahe hai
 The question is that during the last one year, if there is such a possibility of improving the condition of private sector investment in many other states including Uttar Pradesh, why the estimation of private sector investment has not been improved in the country's GDP estimation? Are these promises of entrepreneurs just to create an environment and at present the country's real economic situation is not ready for big private sector investment? Read this: 4 promises of Birla, Ambani, Adani and Mahindra, will invest thousands of crores in UP
 It is said that the NDA government started the Make in India program in 2014 to increase private sector investment in the manufacturing sector of the country
 Area GDP growth to bring rates up to double digits
 isi kram main kendra sarkaar ne ek ke baad ek aarthik sudhaar ke kadam uthaae jinamein infrastracchar deveopment, epadiai sudhaar, ej of duing bijness samet insolvency or bankerpsi code shaamil hai
 Along with this, the Central Government introduced GST in July 2017 to transform the entire country into an integrated market so that investment from private sector can be increased
 in kadamon ke baavjood haal main aae jidipi aankadon par lagbhag sabhi aarthik jaankaron kaa daawa rahaa ki kendra sarkaar kii is flagship yojana ko vifal karne main sabase ahm kaaran nijee kshetra kii sakriyata main kami he
 Recently rating agency Crisil claimed that India's GDP of 7 during the current financial year
 5 fisadi se bad sakati he
 For this pace, Crisil raised hopes of increasing consumption in the country, although the rise in the price of crude oil is the biggest challenge for the economy
 vahiin ek anya agency mudies ne jidipi growth kaa aankalan 7
 Has given 1 percent and has argued that this growth will be due to increase in consumption in the country and the economy can get partial support from investment
 ise padhein: bijepi kaa daawa, UP ko mukhtaar-atik kii jagah diya niveshgauratlab he ki desh main nivesh kii sthiti main giravat kaa silsilaa 2007 main vaishvik vittiya sankat ke baad shuru hua
 Where the investment ratio was 38 per cent in 2007, it dropped to 30 per cent during 2016-17
 haalanki vaishvik vittiya sankat ke baad desh main capital formation kii sthiti main sudhaar (jisase share bazaar main oochaal darj hui) hua lekin nivesh kii sthiti lagaataar kharaab bani rahi or nivesh ke jariye 7-8 fisadi kii growth ke liye aarthik sthiti kamjor bani rahi
 Although there was a big improvement in public sector investment in the country after the financial crisis, but private sector investment in manufacturing sector 19 of 2011-12
 2 fisadi ke str se girakar 2014-15 main 16
 Reached 8 percent
 iske alaava krishi kshetra main nijee nivesh main giravat ke saath is dauraan real state main bhi nivesh main giravat darj hui jisase desh main nae rojgaar ke srijan kii samasya dekhne ko mili
 Along with this, the corporate sector also saw a decline in investment after the global crisis
 yah jahaan 2008 tak 16 fisadi rahaa vahiin 2016 main is kshetra main nivesh girakar 10 fisadi par aa gaya
 Therefore, on the basis of these figures, the multiplication of large investments in a state like Uttar Pradesh raises serious questions
 yadi desh kii arthvyavastha main nijee kshetra kii sahabhaagita par aarthik aankade or aarthik jaankaar sawaal uthaa rahe hai to kya is ground braking kaarykram kaa swaagat karnaa uchit he
 Somewhere in this game of statistics, private sector investment should not become a jumla

 rajasekhar reddy (viesar) kii ek helicopter haadase main maut ke baad unke bete jaganmohan ne uttaradhikari ke taur par mukhyamantri pad ke liye daawa pesh kar diya tha
 He remained there with his family for three months, refusing to vacate the Chief Minister's residence as the tug of war continued in the party
 par tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne unhen manaa kar diya
 Despite suggestions from some people, Sonia Gandhi did not favor Jagan (her popular name) as the state party chief
 naaraaz jagan ne party chhod di or apni nai party yuvajan shramik raitu congress (viesarsi) kaa gathan kiya
 Now, after 10 years, the story has turned completely ‚Äî in Andhra Pradesh, where the Congress fell face-down, Jagan's stars are high
 jagan ne apane pita viesar ko bataur mukhyamantri (2004-2009) aam janata ke bich apni maujuudagi darj karne kii jis kaaryniti kaa paalan karte dekha, usee nakshe kadam par chalate hue unhone jeet hasil kii he
 YSR had created a popular image as a compassionate leader by reaching out to the families of poor and deprived sections across the state through a welfare scheme
 jagan ne apane jansampark kaaryakramon ke dauraan baar-baar ek hi naaraa diya ki ve rajya ko 'rajanaa rajyam (rajasekhar ke shasankaal)' kii tarah hi viksit karenge
 On the lines of his father's statewide tour in 2004, Jagan traveled a record 3,648 km (praja Sankalp Yatra) in 341 days in 2018-19 and during this time he met about one crore people
 is dauraan ve har shuukravaar hyderabad main sibiai kii vishesh adaalat main hajiri bhi darj karaate rahe jahaan un par darjanon vittiya maamle chal rahe hai or unamem korporate, unke dost or naukarshah shaamil hai
 But all is well that ends well

 A
, the founding president of the Center for Policy Studies, Visakhapatnam
 prasanna kumaar kehete hai, ''mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu media ke dulaare the or jagan ek aasaan shikaar
 But by reaching out to the poor in remote areas through Praja Sankalp Yatra, Jagan spread his magic on the people
 ve logon ko moh lene vaale netaa ke taur par ubharkar aae
 Jagan's prayer 'just asking for a chance', with folded hands to end the tdp's evil rule, reached the hearts of the people
 
 
 log aaj bhi viesar ke kalyankari kadamon ko yaad karte hai
 Jagan also took some professional help for his campaign
 2014 ke chunaavon main naidu kii telegu desham party (tidipi) se bahut kam antar se haarane ke baad, unhone chunavi ranneeti taiyaar karne vaale prashanth kishor kii indian political acshan cameti (aai-pack) ko khud kii shakhsiyat sambandhi abhiyaan gande kaa kaam saunpa tha
 In the early days, after attractive slogans like 'jagan Anna Vastunnadu', then slogans like 'ninnu Nammam Babu (we Don't Trust You)', Naidu was chanted and 'nenu Vannanu, Nenu Vinnanu (i'm here and i am listening to you) 'made a place in the hearts of the people and then slogans like' Ravali Jagan, Kevali Jagan (we want Jagan, Jagan should win) 'aroused the hopes of voters
 aai-pack kii muhim main 'jagan anna pilupu' abhiyaan shaamil tha, jisamen gaanv str par kareeb 60,000 aise logon kaa chunaav hua jinka gaanvvaalon par bada prabhaav tha
 His achievements were noted while making the election
 un logon ko jagan ke khud hastakshar kiye gaye vyaktigat patr bheje gaye, saath hi unke karyaalay kaa ek number dete hue apane kshetra or rajya ke vikaas ke liye input saajha karne kaa nirdesh bhi diya gaya
 "we held meetings across the state where people were given the opportunity to interact directly with Jagan," says Asabah Siddiqui of the i-pack, explaining how Jagan created his strong image in the minds of the people
 ''abhiyaan ke baad ke charnon main jagan kii bahan sharmila reddy 11 din ke bas daure par nikaleen jiskaa lakshya janata ke bich jagan kaa sandesh majbootee se pahunchaana tha
 At rallies she would ask people, "praja therapu kavali (what is the decision of the people)"
 '' isejawaab main vishaal janasamudaay hunkaar uthta, ''by by, babu (chandrababu naidu kaa lokapriy naam)
 At the end of the campaign in March, countdown timers were installed in all 175 constituencies to tell Naidu that his time in the state was over
 soshal media par charchaa main bane rahane ke liye party kii websiton par bhi in timer ko pramukhataa se jagah di gai thi
 This campaign, crafted with prudence and foresight, rocked the campaign
 telegu rajyon ke chunavi itihaas main lokapriyata ke shirrsh par baithe kisi netaa ko bhi maton kii sankhya or siton ke pratishat ke maamle main kabhi aisi jeet nahin mili thi jo jagan ke haath ai he
 Every second voter in Andhra Pradesh in 2019 (49
 9 pratishat mat) viesarsi kaa samarthak tha
 Analysts believe that despite the massive support and development programs undertaken by the TDP, the public showed an anti-incumbency trend
 haar par spashtikaran dete hue party ke kuch logon kii daleel he ki abhinayta se netaa bane pawan kalyaan kii jan sena ne shaayad naidu kaa khel bigaada
 Jana Sena won only one assembly seat but it won 6
 7 pratishat maton par kabja kar liya tha, jabaki tidipi ko 39
 1 percent votes received
 tidipi ko 23 vidhayakon se hi santosh karnaa padaa, yah jaanakar jagan ne tanj ksaa, ''bhagwaan ne chandrababu ko dandit karke ek sundar patakatha likhi he
 He said that the TDP chief had bought 23 YSRC mlas after the 2014 elections and, coincidentally, on May 23 of this year, he had the same 23 numbers
 yah haar naidu ke liye behad maayusi se bhari he
 He dreamed of creating a national alternative to challenge the Narendra Modi-led government and met leaders of other parties across the country for this
 bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie ke andhra pradesh ko vishesh shrenee kaa darja dene se inkaar karne ke baad naidu kaa endie se sambandh todgaye kii ranneeti bhi safal nahin hui
 "the faulty feedback mechanism like the real-time Governance Society (RTGS) constituted by the Naidu government did not give them correct information," says Parakala Prabhakar, Naidu's former media advisor
 ve aksar chihnit kiye gaye khushi ke 85 pratishat suchakank ke kaalpanik bulbule main pade rahe

 Hence Naidu's return is difficult
 69 varshiya naidu kii umr bhi unka saath nahin de rahi or ve party main ek madhya str ke netritv kaa nirmaan karne main bhi vifal rahe
 This is a big challenge for his son Nara Lokesh (who lost his first straight election from Mangalagiri assembly seat)
 tidipi pramukh kii vishwasaneeyata aaj sabase nichle str par he, vishesh rup se vipakshi morcha banane ke unke vifal dauron ke baad
 The BJP is already attracting Congress and TDP leaders and has set the ground for the TDP to collapse
 vaise hi jaise congress kii jagah viesarsi ne chin lee he
 This is an emerging challenge for Jagan
 ve vishesh rajya ke darje par modi sarkaar ke raji hone ko lekar pehle se sanshakit hai
 However, before taking oath as Chief Minister, he talked to the Prime Minister to present this claim of the state
 par ab jabaki bhaajapa ko sansad main bahari samarthan kii jarurat nahin he, unhen vishesh darja hasil karne ke liye bhaajapa ke saamne koi shart rakhane kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 Given his combative nature, Jagan will have to continue to challenge Naidu even after he holds the post of Chief Minister
 jagan ne bahuuddeshy polavaram pariyojna ke liye kiye gaye aavantnon or anubandhon, nai rajdhani amravati main bhoomi adhigrahan or aavantnon tathaa bandargah shahar vishakhapatnam main sarkari bhoomi ke aavanton ke sambandh main jaanch karne kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 This will expose corruption of Naidu's tenure, while the major issues of the state will remain intact
 purv prashasnic adhikari or lok satta ke adhyaksh jaiprakash narayan kehete hai, ''andhra pradesh vittiya sankat main he or hamen centre kii madad kii jarurat he
 Jagan can use his eloquence to reap the benefits that were promised during the reorganization of the state in Parliament in 2014
 rajya mushkil daur main he, viesarsi or tidipi ko aapasi vair bhulaakar rajya ke vikaas ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 '' He believes that the new state government will pay Rs 80,000 crore
 kii vah rakam hasil karne kii koshish kerani chahie jo andhra pradesh punargathan adhinium ke tahat centre ko muhaiyaa karaani he
 Narayan admits that the Center will not give tax concessions, but can help Andhra to waive debt and approve special bonds to increase the state's revenue
 jagan is masale par gaur kar rahe hai or unhone andhra ko desh kaa behtareen rajya banane ke liye janata se ek saal kaa vakt maanga he
 Making his debut as a business whose commercial graph had grown rapidly since YSR became chief minister in 2004, Jagan has ventured into many businesses including the cement business, infrastructure and media
 2009 main ve pehali baar saansad bane
 He says that his life got the right direction there
 vidhayak dal kaa netaa chune jane ke baad abhibhoot jagan ne kaha, ''2019 main logon ne ham par bharosa karke hamen vot diya he
 In 2024, they will give a bigger mandate based on our performance
 ham andhra pradesh ko aise model rajya ke rup main viksit karenge ki yah puure desh main misaal ban jayega
 He also announced in line with his election promise that by 2024 the sale of liquor would be restricted to five-star hotels and tourists

 chartered acountint ne unhen bataaya ki kiraye se aa rahi rakam bhi sarkaar ko bataani hogi
 Actually, the era of smooth and easy era of income tax returns is now being worked out
 notebandi or jiesti ke baad sarkaar karadaataaon (vyaktigat, peshwar, kaarobaari) ko kuch chhipaane kaa mauka nahin dena chaahati
 The Income Tax Return Form for the FY 2017-18 is a sample of this "information Uglvao" campaign
 sarkaar kii koshish iskar ritern ke madhyam se karadaataaon kii vittiya jaankaree hasil kar ek tir se kai nishane saadhane kii he
 The government needs complete financial DNA of taxpayers to prevent tax evasion, curb black money and ban benami property
 haalanki yah kahana mushkil he ki isse inspectoron ko kitni takat milegi
 The two forms that are most commonly used to fill monkeyturns by way of escape
 ve itiaar (1) yani sahaj or itiaar (4) yani sugam form hai
 Taxpayers living in India, whose annual taxable income is up to 50 lakh rupees and whose source of income is from salary, pension, interest income or one house property, all file their income tax returns only through a simple form
 vahiin itiaar 4 yani sugam form un kaarobaariyon ke liye hota he jo apane salanaa turnover ko aay maanakar us par ek nishchit tex adaa karte hai
 This year, employed people will have to give a breakup of their salary while filing income tax returns
 aise bhatton ke bare main bataanaa hoga jo tex free nahin hai
 For example, allowances and other facilities that are being given to them at or alongside the payroll

 Information is also hidden in tax free and tax allowances
 nae ritern kaa nishaanaa in par he
 Apart from the salary, there is a provision of giving detailed information about the income from real estate ie property
 sampatti se mila kul kiraaya, property par die gaye sthaneey kar, property par liye gaye karj par bhugtan kii gai byaaj kii raashi aadi kaa byora dena hoga
 This rule came into force only last year that if the monthly rent is more than Rs 50,000, the tenant will pay the rent to the landlord only after deducting tax (TDS)
 is saal ke ritern main yah byora bhi bharaa jayega
 The government tries to hurt the benami property
 maujuuda niyamon ke mutabik, ek se adhik gharon kaa maalik koi vyakti ek hi ghar ko apane istemaal main dikhaa saktaa he
 Even if there is more than one house, taxpayers avoid paying tax in their use
 nae ritern form se karadaata kii sabhi achal sampatti tex system main aa jaaegi
 The ITR (1) or Sahaj form will now be able to be filled by only taxpayers residing in the country, previously non-resident taxpayers could also fill their returns through this form
 apravasi karadaataaon ke liye itiaar 2 form hoga
 That is, the information will be tightened even on non-residents
 kaarobaar kaa scanerasugam form ke jariye ritern bharne vaale vyapaariyon ko is baar jiesti number ke saath saath turnover kii raashi bhi darj kerani hogi
 According to Jiveesh Mehta, Advocate Partner of Maven Legal LLP, the government's clear intention to bring PAN number and GST number in the income tax return is to add direct and indirect tax
 aisa nahin ki sarkaar abhi kisi form yaa vyapaaree kii koi jaankaree hasil nahin kar sakati, lekin iskar ritern main jiesti number darj karaane ke baad mahaj pan ke jariye kaarobaar kaa puraa record khul jayega
 a PAN has multiple PAN numbers
 jiesti unic number he or ritern main karadaata kii ore se darj pan number hi sahi mana jayega
 Therefore, the possibility of a firm having more PAN cards will also be eliminated
 kaala dhan ghumaane ke liye bani kagaji companiyon bhi nishane par hai
 It is not possible to identify a company without a PAN number
 pan or jiesti number ke saath aate hi companiyaan tex ke jaal main aa sakati hai
 The government has recently sent notices to more than 2
5 lakh shell or paper companies
 isse pehle bhi sarkaar kareeb sava do lakh aisi companiyon kaa panjikaran radd kar chuki he
 Here is the biggest change in the smooth form of income tax: Now the stakeholder in the firm and their capital, debt and permanent assets will also have to be given in the returns
 chhapemari ke dauraan yah jaankaree sabase bada hathiyaar hogi yani ki karadaata ke paas ritern main ghoshit sampatti se zyada milti he to phir iskar vaale uske intjaar main hai
 Satendra Jain, senior managing partner of Inspector Raj's Khathrejendra Jain & Associate, says that such changes in form have made it more complex than before which would increase the complex cost (cost of filing returns) of the common taxpayer and small traders
 is ritern ko bharne ke liye tex export yaa chartered acountint kii jarurat hogi
 However Jain is not very excited
 ve kehete hai ki beete 25 saal kii practice main unhone aise badlaav kai dfa dekhe, lekin sarkaar is aankadon ke jariye koi bada kaam nahin kar pai he
 Hence, there is a great need to update the tax software and repair the system

 It is a project to curb black money
 ritern ke aankadon kaa istemaal is project main hoga
 Khan says that GST is the tax levied on every transaction, whose returns are deposited every month
 iskar ritern kisi karadaata kii ore se saal main ek baar bharaa jaataa he
 In such a situation, it is difficult to match the figures of GST and Income Tax Returns
 in aakadon ke na milane par vibhaag ke bhrashtachar yaa inspetctor raaj badaae kaa khatra bharpoor he
 Better, now fill the income tax returns in full consciousness
 sarkaar sab dekh rahi he

 Taxpayers can be divided into two categories to easily understand the penalty penalty penalty for non-filing of returns
 pehali, salanaa paanch lakh rupye tak kii aay vaale karadaata or duusari, salanaa paanch lakh rupye se zyada kii kar yogya aay vaale karadaata
 Taxpayers with an annual taxable income of five lakh rupees can file their returns by December 31 with a penalty of five thousand rupees if they miss the July 31 deadline
 vahiin 1 janvari se 31 march 2019 tak yah ritern 10,000 rupye kii penlti ke saath bhare ja sakate hai
 On the other hand, the penalty amount will be Rs 1,000 for taxpayers with income up to Rs 5 lakh per annum
 dedline chukne ke baad 31 march 2019 tak ye karadaata kabhi bhi penlti ke saath apana ritern file kar sakate hai

 An IAS officer of the state became more talkative when he got a chance to meet the Planning Commission officials in the meeting
 unhonebihar ke vikaas kii batenshuru kar deen
 Only a minute after his speech, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar cut his talk very politely in the middle
 "there is no need to discuss these things here
 ''nitish ne kaman sambhalate hue kaha, ''ye vibhaag main nae hai or inhen zyada jaankaree nahin he
 The ground reality is something else
 bihar ko gambhir sookhe se jujhna pad rahaa he
 His message reached the people in the room
 makasad bihar kii safalataa kii daastaan kaa gungan karnaa nahin balki kosh kii jarurat jaahir karnaa tha
 In a meeting with Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia for the next two hours, the secretaries present with the Chief Minister rarely got to speak and almost all the talks were done by the Chief Minister himself - he clearly explained why he needed more funds 
 nitish kaa prastutikaran tathyon or aankadon se bharpoor tha; unhone sahajata or spashtataa se lekin bordroom main maujuud anya logon ke mukaable mand swar main niti sambandhi pahalon or gatirodhon kaa vistrut byora diya, phir bhi apane aagrah par jor dene or apni baat vishwasaneey dhang se rakhane main safal bhi rahe
 Almost immediately after the meeting held in New Delhi on 15 February, Ahluwalia increased the annual plan of Bihar by 20 per cent to Rs 24,000 crore
 kar diya
 Nitish, returning to power for the second time in a row after winning a landslide victory in the November 2010 assembly elections, seems to be ignored in his first term - if he has to live up to his promises, he will have to communicate the same thinking among bureaucrats as well
 Have understood the importance of pehle nitish nitiyonyojanaon ke amal main pichhadane waalon ko bardaasht karte rahe the
 During his first tenure, there were a lot of complaints against the bureaucrats
 duusare kaarykaal main, unhone tay kar liya ki ab bas bahut ho gaya
 In the same month, Nitish made several announcements to set a time limit for the bureaucrats
 masalanah ab baabuon se file ko teen din main nipataane ke liye kaha gaya he anyathaa unhen sajaa bhugatni hogi
 The new system has come into effect from April 25 and will be applicable to all government employees - from office assistant to department head
 isi tarah, vibhaag pramukhon ko chetaya gaya he ki ve sarkari adhikariyon ko bina tainaati ke pratiksha suchi main na banaae rakhen
 His new steps have made Nitish a role model at the national level
 4 april ko kendriya carmik mantralay ne aadesh die the ki sabhi iees adhikariyon or group hue' ke kendriya seva ke anya adhikariyon ko apane vaarshik sampatti ritern ke bare main jaankaree saarvajanik kerani hogi-yah kadam jaahir taur par bihar ke farvari main uthaae kadam se prerit tha
 But, this is not the first time the rest of the country has followed the Nitishki initiative
 mahilaon ke liye panchayaton or anya shahari nikaayon main 50 fisadi aarakshan lagu karne kaa centre sarkaar kaa faisla, bihar ke is sandarbh main misaal kaayam karne ke baad liya gaya tha
 The formation of a call center and special assistant police for applicants to the Right to Information (RTI) Act are some of their other decisions, which have been reiterated
 bihar main sadakon, shiksha or swasthya ke hnetra main bada badlaav dekhne ko mila he
 Their positive steps for women and social efforts like Mahadalit-centric policies have also led to results
 in sab ne unke kad main or ijapha kar diya he, lekin nitish aasaani se santusht hone vaale nahin
 In his current tenure, Nitish is clearly seen taking lessons from his mistakes
 sirf do saal pehle hi farvari 2009 main unhone ek jansabha main manch se hi afasarshahon se apane mobile number sabko dene ke liye kaha tha, taaki aam aadmi kii sarkaar ke sheersh adhikariyon tak sidhi pahunch ho sake
 Contrary to this, the then Chief Secretary R
K
 je
 M
 pillai sareekhe adhikariyon ke phone kii ghanti bajnaa hi band nahin ho rahi thi-kuch to unhen tadake 4 baje phone karke yah dekh rahe the ki ve jawaab dete bhi hai yaa nahin
 Water was soon poured over the move along with phone numbers
 iske sthaan par, unhone seva kaa adhikaar kanoon lagu kiya jo logon ko samay seemaa ke tahat seva muhaiyaa karaayega
 Nitish's idea of an accountable administration has still not changed, but now his methods have become more realistic and less rhetorical
 saaf taur par, nitish kumaar pratikatmakataa par vaastaviktaa ko tarjeeh de rahe hai
 This change of his is slow but effective
 bataur ek raajnneetik ve janata kii marji ke mutabik kaam karnaa band nahin kar sakate lekin ve saaf taur par samaj gaye hai ki sirf bolne se hi kuch nahin hone vaala
 Along with the influx of countless ideas to shape governance, they also know how they will be implemented
 ek varisht iees adhikari bataate hai, ''nitish ko vibhaagon kebaare main unke sachivon se zyada jaankaree he
 In the midst of the power point presentation, they can ask you to go to the previous slide and answer their questions
 ve yah bhi jaanate hai ki kis lambit pariyojna ke liye kis sanyukt sachiv ko dilli main phone karnaa chahie
 Moreover, they are very sharp-minded and you cannot bluff them
 '' isse yah baat saaf ho jaati he ki apane duusare kaarykaal main mukhyamantri kuch naakhush kyon dikhaai dete hai
 They are probably restless because all their ideas have not yet been converted into grassroots schemes
 mukhyamantri apane naam pehle hi kai achche kaam darj kara chuke hai
 With the move to curb legislative waste by abolishing the Local Area Development Fund (local Area Development fundlad), introducing the Right to Service Act and making the assets of all government officials and ministers public, Nitish turned to the national stage
 The work of repairing his house has started earlier than expected
 nitish kumaar kii sabase badi samasya nakaaratmak baton kii lambii fehrist rahi he jo uplabdhiyon ke baavjood bihar ko peeche dhakelne main lagi hui hai
 For example, of course the state has 10 in 2010405 to 201011
 93 fisadi kii vruddhi, jo desh main sabase adhik vruddhi daron main se ek he, darj kii he, phir bhi isaki prati vyakti aay sabase kam he, saath hi isaki 54
 4% of the population lives below the poverty line
 isi tarah, pichley paanch saal main bihar main twarit sunwaayee vyavastha ke kaaran 57,341 aparaadhiyon ko doshi siddh kiya ja chukaa he, lekin inamen se kai apradhi jamaanat hasil kar chuke hai; sambhawatah isiilie aparaadh or sangyanatmak aparaadhon kii dar ab bhi bad rahi he
 Once again, investment is increasing, but Bihar is also facing a 45 percent power shortage
 ve koshish chaahe jitani kar rahe hon, nitish ko kai log ''kuch to kiya he'' mukhyamantri ke taur par dekhte hai-yah visheshan pichley saal unke liye jeet kaa paigaam to laayaa lekin sampoornataa kaa ehsaas nahin laa sakaa
 Despite the best efforts, there is still a big difference in the promises made by Nitish Kumar and implemented
 lekin unke sabar kaa baandh tuutane laga he yah spasht hua pichley maah ek jansabha ke dauraan jab unhone afasarshahi kii adngebaaji par khij jataai
 Public display of resentment is completely unexpected for the humble Nitish and also against the established tradition
 raajnneetik or afasarshah nijee taur par ekadusre ko koste rahete hai lekin unke bich yah maun sahmati maani jaati he ki ve in baton ko kabhi bhi saarvajanik taur par jaahir nahin karenge
 The chief minister's grudge is a sign of his frustration with those officers who "are unable to keep pace with his thinking
" ''nitish kumaar kaa yah kahana ki ve kai raat is chintaa ke saath sote hai ki kahin koi janakalyankari yojana lalaphitaashahee kii bhent to nahin chadh gai-unka ek nayaa pahalu saamne laati he
 This is because in the past, Nitish Kumar has been considered more confident of bureaucrats than party workers
 lekin ab ve nakel bhi kasne ko puri tarah taiyaar dikhte hai
 They know that being late is sometimes like being blind
 kul milakar dekhen to nitish kumaar kii team ne acha pradarshan kiya he
 The Secretary, Bihar Road Construction Department, Supriya Amrit is the only IAS officer who has been awarded the Prime Minister's Distinction Award in public administration in the individual category
 unki is uplabdhi ko bihar ke navajagaran ke saath hi jod kar dekha ja saktaa he
 The bureaucrat is not the only part of Nitish's cleanliness drive
 gramin kaary mantri bhim singh ko bhi us samay karaara jawaab mila jab ve party ke ek kaarykram ke naam par ''janata kaa darbar'' se khisakane kii koshish kar rahe the
 He was told, "sit on your seat and stay on the seat till the court ends
" '' ek anya mantri kii us samay khinchaai hui jab rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii baithak ke dauraan mahila vidhayak ne un par ek ejeeniyar kaa paksh lene kaa aarope lagaaya
 Nitish Kumar knows that he will not be able to perform well until the system is clean
 ve chaahate hai ki vidhayak or afasarshah donon hi unke vichaaron par amal karen
 Where can Nitish go from here? There are speculations that Bihar is a place of experiment for their future plans
 bhaajapa ke saath sambandhon ke baavjood unki dharmanirpeksh chhavi kaayam he, jis kaaran rajg unki chhavi kaa istemaal agle loksabhaa chunaavon main or adhik dalon ko aakarshith karne ke liye kar saktaa he
 But why this unusual haste? At the age of 60, Nitish knows that this is the right time for him to move forward
 iske alaava, unki ucch reating ke kaaran hi kai log maanate hai ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke punerjeevit hone ke prayaason kii raah main sabase badi chunauti bhi ve hi hai

 Bharti said that the Modi government is taking steps one by one against black money
 upi chunaav par unka kahana he ki uttar pradesh main siem pad kii ummidavaari se zyada unke liye party kii jeet myne rakhti he
 No one will be a leader or an officer, no one will be left, says Union Minister Uma Bhartika, that the Modi government has closed the note to stop black money and corruption
 usamen netaa ho yaa afasar koi bhi ho batch nahin paaegaa
 He talked about taking this campaign of Modi with black money
 virodh karne waalon ke paas hoga kaala dhanuma bharti kaa kahana he ki jo log note bandi kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Be it Kejriwal, Mayawati, Mamta Banerjee or Congress people, they will have black money
 isiilie vah virodh kar rahe hai
 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who used to talk about the campaign against corruption
 aaj vah modi ke kaale dhan ke khilaaf muhim kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 They should support Modi
 sab kuch thik kar degi modi sarkaruma bharti ne kaha ki aam janata modi ke is faisle ke saath he
 There are definitely some problems, which are going away

 On the questions arising again and again about political donations, Uma Bharti says that wherever there will be black money

 Uma Bharti says that some black money people have come out
 kuch kaa abhi aana baaki he
 Like some snakes come out of the bill and some remain inside
 vah bhi baahar aa jaaenge
 Temple is not an electoral issue, on the theme of faith, Uma Bharti says when the temple issue is remembered, the temple is a matter of faith, not an election issue
 media hi is mudde ko lekar aati he
 The temple is more than his life
 mandir ke liye vah jaan bhi de sakati hai, vah ram mandir andolan se judi rahi hai
 Regarding the electoral issue in Uttar Pradesh elections, Union Minister Uma Bharti says that the party will contest elections on the issue of development
 uttar pradesh main bhrashtachar or kanoon vyavastha mudda hoga, magar jati sameekaran bhi koi nazarandaaj nahin kar saktaa
 On the question of going to UP as the Chief Minister herself, Uma Bharti says that this question is not important for her as she has left the post of Chief Minister in the past
 agar vah siem kii kursi naa chhodti, to koi unako hataa nahin saktaa tha
 It is important for the BJP to form government in Uttar Pradesh
 bharti kaa kahana he ki indra devtaa bhi unako apane bagal main asana de baithne ke liye, to vah manaa kar dengi

 pehle mana ja rahaa tha ki congress kii taraf se deree ho rahi thrub congress-shivasena ko lag rahaa ki sharad pavaar ne deree karwimaharashtra main shivasena or bijepi kaa gathbandhan tuutane ke baad mana ja rahaa tha ki sarkaar banane main congress kii taraf se der ho rahi he
 The Congress was being blamed for the lack of government in the state
 lekin ab shivasena or congress- donon ko andeh ho rahaa he ki yah sharad pavaar hai jo congress or shivasena ko saath laane kii puri prakriya main der kar rahe hai
 a sudden progress in the entire development came when suddenly Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray held two meetings with Congress leaders in Mumbai
 mangalvaar shaam ko ahamed patel ne sharad pavaar or anya ensipi netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 After this, Ahmed Patel had his first meeting with Uddhav Thackeray late on Tuesday night
 phir buudhvaar dopaher ko ashok chavaan, rajya congress pramukh balasaheb thoraat or manikrav thakare jaise congress netaaon ke saath uddhav kii mulaakaat hui
 The meeting was held when Shiv Sena and Congress leaders felt that Sharad Pawar was adopting a strategy to hang the case
 mangalvaar ko sabhi ko intjaar tha ki congress netaa ahamed patel, kasee venugopal or mallikarjun khadge ensipi ke netaaon ke saath charchaa karke koi sateek rasta nikaalenge
 But suddenly the people were stunned by the Governor's recommendation of President's rule and calling a Cabinet meeting from the Center
 yahaan tak ki shivasena or congress bhi stabdh rah gayi kyonki ensipi ne unhen vishwaas main liye bagaiyr, chupchaap rajyapal ko patr bhejkar 48 ghante kii mohalat maangi or isi patr ke aadhaar par rajyapal ne centre ko apni sifarish bhej di
 Hours later, the deadline given by the Governor to the NCP was ending
 rajyapal ne ensipi ke patr ko aadhaar banaakar apni siforishein bhejin, yah baat na to shivasena ko maaloom thi or na hi congress ko
 The timing of sending letters to the governor also raised doubts in the minds of the Shiv Sena and the Congress
 mangalvaar raat ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ko brazil ravaanaa hona tha or dopaher baad cabinet kii baithak hone vaali thi
 The Shiv Sena and the Congress doubt how the ncp's letter reached the Governor at the same time and sent a recommendation for imposition of President's rule to the Home Ministry
 tab tak sharad pavaar ensipi, shivasena or congress ke bich mahagathbandhan taiyaar karne kaa abhinay kar rahe the
 He even told the media and the Shiv Sena that the Congress was delaying in deciding the alliance due to ideology
 lekin iske ulat somvaar ko jab shivasena sarkaar gathan kii samaysima badhwane ke liye governor house gai, congress ne mumbai main apana samarthan patr taiyaar kar rakhaa tha or dilli alaakaman kii muhar kaa intjaar kar rahi thi, jahaan par isi mudde par congress netaaon kii baithak chal rahi thi
 Sonia Gandhi spoke to Sharad Pawar on the phone before proceeding, while Sharad Pawar asked him to wait
 unhone sonia gandhi se kaha, ‚Äòabhi tak kuch bhi tay nahin hua he
 After this, Sonia Gandhi scolded the leaders of the state Congress for hurting her and the Shiv Sena came back empty-handed from the Governor's House
 lekin ab jab sharad pavaar ne san ket diya ki sarkaar gathan ke liye baaki kii baatcheet sansad satr ke dauraan dilli main hogi to shivasena or congress netaaon ne aapas main milane or baatcheet karne kaa faisla kiya
 When this meeting was held in Mumbai, the NCP was not told anything about it
 congress netaaon kaa kahana he ki yadi sharad pavaar kii koi vishesh maang he to unhen spasht kerani chahie, lekin sarkaar gathan ke liye baatcheet main der hone se navaniyukt vidhayakon par naitik dabaav badhegaa
 a senior Congress leader told India Today, "we wanted to move the conversation forward but Sharad Pawar told us that now further talks will take place when we meet in Delhi during the Parliament session
" " sutron ke mutabik, shivasena, congress or ensipi ke bich baatcheet abhi tak ek inch bhi aage nahin bad saki he or abhi unhen lambii duuri tay kerani he
