 unhone kaha, main ek tarah se hairaan nahin tha, lekin main jaanata tha ki yah chunauteepurn hoga, lekin jivan main jab aapako chunautiyaan di jaati hai to aapako apni kaabiliyat par bharosa karnaa chahie or ise nibhaana chahie
 
 
 The 83-run innings against England was not the best, but definitely the effort, which proved to boost my morale
 
 
 van-de main salaami ballebaaj kii bhoomika kii chunauti (kyonki ab do nai genden istemaal kii jaati hai) ke bare main poochne par rohit ne sweekaar kiya ki yah nishchit rup se ek badi chunauti he
 
 
 "the role of the opener has changed to play with two new balls," he said
 
 
 yah aisa nahin rahaa ki gendbaaji shuru hote hi aap un par haaavee ho jaao
 
 
 There are some shots that you should avoid in the early overs
 
 
 rohit ne 98 van-de international maichon main do shatakon or 17 ardhshtakon kii madad se 2,459 ran banaae hai
 He said, i was not surprised in a way, but i knew that it would be challenging, but when you are given challenges in life, then you should trust your ability and keep it up
 
 
 england ke khilaaf 83 ran kii pari sarvshereshth nahin thi, lekin nishchit rup se prayaas tha, jo mere manobal ko badhaane vaala sabit hua
 
 
 When asked about the challenge of playing the opener in odis (because two new balls are used now), Rohit admitted that this is definitely a big challenge
 
 
 unhone kaha, do nai gendon se khilne ke liye salaami ballebaaj kii bhoomika badal gai he
 
 
 It is not like you dominate them as soon as the bowling starts
 
 
 kuch shot aise hote hai, jinase shuruaati overon main aapako bachanaa chahie

 The Aam Aadmi Party government led by Arvind Kejriwal came to power in Delhi vowing to end corruption, but now the leader of the same party is being accused of promoting corruption and nepotism

 soshal media kii duniya main congress party lagaataar bijepi se pichhadati najar aati he, jisko lekar congress ab apni ranneeti ko nae sire se banane kii taiyaari main he
 The Congress party's performance on social media is that the Twitter accounts of INC India and Rahul Gandhi, the official website of the Congress, are unable to trend and Deepender Hooda, Bhupendra Hooda's birthday trend or any of his speeches
 yahi kaaran he kii congress main iti cell ko lekar jhagada lagaataar jari he, jab hooda sarkaar haryana main thi, tabhi deependra hooda ko congress ke iti cell kaa pramukh banaaya gaya tha jiske baad rahul pandey kii iti cell ke mukhiya ke taur par niyukti kar di gai thi
 But after Congress' defeat in the Haryana Assembly elections, Hooda had stopped paying the expenses of IT cell
 jiske baad iti cell kaa kharch congress party ke koshadhyaksh motilal vora dene lage
 But the question remains whether the IT team's dedication is only with the Hooda family? Due to which the dispute continued to grow, due to which IT chief Rahul Pandey has offered resignation 10-12 times
 pike or rahul gandhi se hui mulaqatise main ek baar phir rahul gandhi or congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor se bahes ke baad rahul pandey ne istife kii peshkash kar di
 The debate between Prashant Kishore and Rahul Pandey was on why the Congress policies, Rahul's birthday and the Congress ticket army against those who attacked Rahul, are shattered, but when the opportunity comes, Rahul Pandey's chief Dipendra Hooda's birthday and Dipendra When the Congress comes up with an issue related to his father Bhupendra Hooda, then why is this army of the Congress's social media strongly seen? Race Rahul Gandhi and then counterattack when unable to trends in social media
 aise department kii kya jarurat par usase bada sawaal yah he ki yah department jab kisi vyaktigat maamle ko trend kara saktaa he to congress party or media vibhaag ke die hue muddon par kyon peeche rah jaataa he
 Including Rahul Pandekul, now the responsibility of social media failure among the Congress party will be fixed under which the new team will be entrusted to the media in-charge of Congress, Randeep Surjewala
 koshish yahi rahegi kii nai team kisi vyakti vishesh kii bajaae rahul gandhi or party ke liye jor aajamaaish karen
 The resignation of Rahul Pandey, who resigned 10 to 12 times and looks cold hot on all the people, is accepted this time or indeed he has been fired or asked to resign, after which his return seems to be a problem

 After the ban of 500 and 1000 rupees old notes, it has come out for companies like Paytm, Freecharge and Mobi Quick
 cashles tranjaction ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 On one hand, Paytm is saying that do not paytm, then on the other hand, PM Narendra Modi has told the countrymen today that they can easily do shopping from mobile as easily as they forward whatsapp messages
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki jis desh ke paas yuva takat he or jahaan 100 karod se zyada mobile dharak hai, isliye logon ko iske istemaal ke liye prerit karen
 But the question is whether banktransaction through mobile is so easy and secure as to forward the message of whatsapp? Can bank transactions be done through mobile phones? Is there any difference between smartphone and mobile? It is important to note that about 30 percent of the people in the country have a smartphone
 jabaki smartphone or mobile phones mila kar desh bhar main 100 karod se zyada sabskribar hai
 Transacting from mobile is different from forwarding messages on whatsapp
 whatsap par massej karne main koi khatra nahin he, kyonki massej forward karne kaa makasad use logon tak pahunchaana hota heonline tranjaction yani internet ke jariye paison ke len dein main hajaar khatre hai
 If there is a slight omission, then money can be lost from the account
 Forwarding the message on whatsapp does not require a fast internet connection
 desh main internet kii sthiti se to aap waakif honge
 Many times money is cut by doing online transaction in slow connection and no work is done
 haalanki baad main paise mil jate hai, lekin agar samay par kaam na ho to kya phayda
 It does not take money to forward messages on whatsapp, it is necessary to have money in your account for online transactions
 lekin abhi bhi kai logon ko selary ke taur cash miltaa he
 What will they do in such a situation? agar aapkaa smartphone yaa computer hack ko gaya to whatsap par to koi khaas asar nahin hoga
 Information related to online transactions are stored in your smartphone and computer which you do not see
 lekin agar aap hack ho gaye to dhire dhire aapke acount main send lag sakati he
 OTP is not required to forward any message on whatsapp
 kisi bhi bank tranjaction ke liye otipi kii jarurat hoti he or yah tab hi aayega jab aapke mobile main natwork ho
 If the network is not available then the payment will fail, if there is haste then you cannot do anything

 What should i say Why was Rohit not awakened when he slept till four in the evening (on Tuesday)? He said that the relationship between Rohit Shekhar and his wife was not good and 'there was a rift between the two from the first day of marriage
 ’ shekhar or unki maa 11 april ko apana vot daalane ke liye haldwani gaye the
 He was scheduled to come to Delhi on 12 April but changed his plan when Rohit said that he wanted to meet his people

 After going to the Ghat, he went to Neem Karoli Baba's blessings
 ’ 15 april ko maa-bete dilli laut aae
 Shekhar went to his house at Defense Colony while Ujjwala went to Tilak Lane and later returned
 unhone kaha, ‘jab main waapas ai to apurva (shekhar kii patni) se uske bare main poocha, usne mujhe bataaya ki vah thake hue hai, isliye raat kaa khaanaa khaaya or sone chale gaye
 Meanwhile, Shekhar comes down and says that he is tired

 jab maine uski haalat dekhi to mujhe uske bachane kii kam hi ummid thi
 He said, 'I trusted Apoorva and did not question her why Shekhar had slept for so long

 kal dilli main congress ke daftar main grahamantri kii press conference ke dauraantitalar ko sibiai kii clin chit ke masale par ek sikh patrkaar jaranel singh ulajh padaa tha
 Chidambaram got worried about Jarnail Singh being asked questions
 unhone no argument kaha, uske baad patrkaar jaranel singhbhadak uthaa or juuta uthaakar grahamantri kii taraf phenk daalaa
 Everyone was surprised but Chidambaram remained calm, as if nothing had happened
 jaanate hai kyon, kyonki congress samajhati he ki is mudde ko is vakt zyada hawa dena usee kii hawa nikaal saktaa he
 That is why the Congress did not delay at all, saying that they should not take any action against Jarnail Singh
 party ne usee vakt maamla dabaane kii koshish to kii, lekin aisa ho naa sakaa
 The shock that the Sikh journalist gave to Congress by throwing a shoe at Chidambaram on the issue of 84 riots has made that journalist a hero among Sikh organizations
 sikhon ke sanghathan jaranel singh ke haq main sadakon par utar aae
 From Chandigarh to Delhi, Sikh organizations have started speaking in one voice

 Damdami mint is a big organization of Sikhs, it has prepared to stop rail in Punjab today on this issue
 wo to ab jaranel singh kii tarif karte nahin thak rahi
 This is not what the Congress wanted, the public may have accepted the statements of opposing parties like the BJP and the Akali Dal, but the Sikh organizations coming out on the streets like this before the election can make it difficult for the Congress

 misaal ke taur par 'ek desh-ek chunaav' ke masale par pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara bulaai gai sarvadaleey baithak main mamata banerjee shaamil nahin huin thim
 Similarly, in the Saradha chit fund scam, the team was taken into custody by the Kolkata Police last year when the CBI reached to question Rajiv Kumar

 The CBI is also barred from entering the state for raids without permission

 Having seen so much confrontation and refrained from meeting till now, the BJP is looking at Mamata Banerjee's arrival in Delhi to meet PM Modi and Amit Shah

 In fact, on the lines of this film, the sub-inspector who came to Delhi with a fake income tax officer raided an office and the two got into trouble with a new currency of 20 lakh rupees
 police ke mutabik, kaarobaari lalit vadhava se apane puraane note exange karwaane ke liye south dilli ke property dealer vikaas vashishtha se sampark kiya tha
 It was decided to give a new currency of 20 lakh rupees in exchange for old notes of 24 lakh rupees

 Significantly, for the past several days, the team was practicing cricket in Dharamshala where Kapil Dev spent time with the star cast of the film and gave them tips on the nuances of the game
 ranvir singh bhi pichley kaaphi vakt se kapil dev ke saath baat kar rahe hai or unke tach main bane hue hai taaki vah kapil dev kaa andaaj copy karnaa sikh saken
 Members of various parties in the Lok Sabha expressed deep concern over the abduction by Sukma District Collector Alex Pal Menonka Maoists in Chhattisgarh and demanded the government to take effective steps to free them
 shoonyakaal main annadramuk ke thambidurai ne yah maamla uthaate hue kaha ki karyaalay nirikshan ke dauraan menon kaa apharan bahut durbhagyapurna ghatana he
 The incident has instilled fear among IAS officers
 menon ko bachaane ke sabhi prayaas kiye jane kii maang karte hue unhone kaha ki grih mantri pi chidambaram or pradhanmantri manmohan singh is mudde par bayaan den
 dmk's TR Baloo said concrete action is needed to save Menon's life
 unhone kaha ki menon kaa apharan na sirf prashasan ke liye chetavanee he balki aantarik suraksha ke liye bhi bahut bada khatra he
 It is the responsibility of the Center to release Menon
 aisi ghatnaayen hone se rokane ke liye sarkaar ko adhikariyon ko paryaapt sangrakshan dena chahie
 Congress's SS Ramasubbu said that the kidnapping of Menon was a major setback for the nation

 It is noteworthy that earlier the Maoists kidnapped two Italian citizens and a BJD MLA in Odisha
 bhartiya janata party kaa 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye jari ghoshnaptr (sankalp-patr) ke rashtrawaad se jude pramukh mudde adaalat kii dahalij main pahunch chuke hai or in par court ke faisle kaa intjaar puure desh ko he
 But lawyers believe that this will facilitate the government to work

 Actually, reaching a case in court can be both convenient and inconvenient
 agar faisla sarkaar ke khilaaf jaataa he to use duusare vidhaayi taur-tareeke apnaane pad sakate hai
 Advocate Ashwani Upadhyay, who took many of these issues to the court through a PIL, says that these subjects are important for the country and were going on for a long time
 inkaa ek acha pahalu ye he ki jaise hi inpar bahes shuru hogi or centre sarkaar in par apana rukh spasht karegi to in par faisla ho jayega
 Upadhyay says that this will also save the time of the government
 sarkaar ko kaam karne main suvidha hogi
 For this, the government will not have to make amrai and persuade all parties, only they will have to tell their opinion to the court
 upaadhyaay kehete hai ki rashtrawaad se jude bhaajapa ke zyaadaatar maamle adaalat aa chuke hai
 Apart from this, as the BJP has said about the digitization of land records in the manifesto, but Ashwini Upadhyay has filed an application to link it with Aadhaar

 The government's reply on this is also awaited
 haalanki jansankhya niyantran par koi bhi party abhi tak mukhar virodh nahin kar rahi he
 However, the political impact of the decisions coming on these issues related to nationalism will be profound
 *** In Bundi, Rajasthan, the body of the son of a BJP leader's son was found in suspicious circumstances and the carcass was disturbed

 Anees Ahmed, in-charge of Sadar police station in Bundi, said that the dead body of Rajat Sharma, 22-year-old son of Mahendra Sharma, district president of Bhabhapakisan Morcha, was found lying on the roadside in Mathunda village last night

 Family members said that he was going to get married next month too
 police ke anusaar rajat ke sir par gaharaa jakhm paaya gaya he
 Rajat's family members say that two gang members have killed him due to past hostilities
 darasal, rajat pichley saal isi gaanv main hui ek hatya kaa chashmadid gavaah bhi tha or jald hi vah adaalat main apana bayaan darj karaane vaala tha
 Police officer-in-charge Anees Ahmed said that the police has registered a case

 Even after the post mortem report comes, some things will be revealed
 bijepi saansad yogi adityanath ne samaajawaadee party ke rajat jayanti ke maukey par samaajawaadee party par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Yogi has said that a family drama is being done to hide the government's failure, adding that the US agency is behind this family drama
 uttar pradesh ke balrampur pahuncheyogi adityanathane sapa kii mahagathbandhan kii koshish ko bhi aade haathon liya
 He said that how can the grand alliance be formed by those who cannot combine the family
 bijepi saansad ne samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke sabhi netaa avasarwaadi qaraar diya
 Along with this, Yogi targeted Amar Singh and said that the script of the family drama that is going on has been written by Amar Singh, and everything is being done to mislead people
 ab aa gaya he dhan, sampatti, sukh samruddhi, aishwarya paane kaa mauka
 This is the occasion to get the blessings of Mahadev with Lord Vishnu
 ye he sabase pavitra maheene kaa sabase paavan din jab ganga main snaan or daan karke aap paa sakate hai sukh-samruddhi kaa vardaan
 In Hindu tradition, Kartik month is considered to be the most auspicious month and the full moon of this month i
e
 Kartik Purnima is said to give a renewable fruit
 karthik poornima kii subah ravivaar ko bharni nakshatra main ho rahi he
 It has been said in the scriptures that bathing and worshiping the Ganges in Bharani Nakshatra achieves all kinds of opulence
 iske saath hi is din 7 tarah ke atishubh yoga kaa nirmaan ho rahaa he ye yoga hai kaaldand yoga, makardhvaj, jalaj, vritasya yoga, muni yoga, haridra, or mahamrityujny yoga
 Due to the formation of these Yogas, the full moon has brought a golden opportunity for those who are suffering from Jalsa Kalsarp Dosh, Pitridosh Mangaldosh
 yun to saal main lagbhag 16 amavasya padati he lekin varsh kii sabase kaali or lambii amavasya kii raatri karthik maas kii amavasya yani diwaali ko mana gaya he or uske thik 15 din baad karthik maas kii poornima padati he jo adhankar kaa naash karti he
 It is said that on this day Lord Shiva killed a demon named Tripurasura and was called Tripurari
 thik usee tarah manushya apane andar kaam, krodh, lobh rupi asuri pravritiyon kaa naash kar gyaan rupi prakaash ko praapt karata he
 Kartik Purnima is also called Mahakartiki Purnima, the day Lord Vishnu wore the Matsya avatar to protect the Vedas
 kehete hai mahabharat ke 18 din lambey yuddh main maare gaye sambandhiyon or yoddhaon kii aatma kii shanti ke liye bhagwaan shri krishna ke kehane par yudhisthir ne karthik maas ke shukla paksh kii ashtami se chaturdashi tak yajna kiya or poornima ke hi din snaan kar purnahuti di thi or tabhi se ye manyata chali aa rahi he ki is din ganga snaan karne se pitrudosha se mukti milti he
 The worship and fasting done on Kartik Purnima which provides all the happiness and opulence is directly received by God
 is din vidhi-vidhaan se kii gai bhagwaan satyanarayan kii puja se pratishtha kii prapti hota he vahiin shiv ji kaa abhishek karne se uttam swasthya or dderghaayu milti he
 The person's popularity increases with respect to freedom from fear and worship of Suryadev by donating a lamp

 So what is it to stay with us to know the right method of worship
 dilli main sadak durghatnaon main ghayal hue logon ke madadgaaron ke liye dilli sarkaar ne bada elaan kiya he
 If someone reaches the hospital without delay on the road, then the Delhi government will now give a cash reward of two thousand rupees
 dilli cabinet ne is faisle par apni muhar laga di he or jaldi hi ye faisla lagu ho jayega
 It has often been seen that helping a person injured in a road accident forces people to avoid getting caught in any legal trouble
 isi dar se kai baar ghayalon ko vakt rahete madad nahin mil paati or ye deree unke liye jaanaleva sabit hoti he
 There has been a demand in this regard for a long time that such helpers should be given legal protection, so that the fear of needlessly getting into legal fights can be removed
 centre sarkaar ne bhi iske liye good samartian kanoon banaaya he or supreme court bhi police samet aspataalon ko nirdesh de chuki he ki ghayalon ko aspataal main laane waalon se poochtacha na ho or unhen kisi kanoonee karrwai main na shaamil kiya jaae
 Rather, the injured should be treated first when they are taken to the hospital so that their lives can be saved
 saath hi ghayal ko aspataal pahunchane vaale shaks se awwal to koi sawaal na hi kiya jaae or jarurat ho to kam se kam kaagazi karrwai ho
 The Delhi government has also taken a step in this direction and has decided to reward the helpers, so that not only they get scared out of their heart, but also they get the feeling that their work has been appreciated
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sitaudiya ke mutabik, sarkaar chaahati he ki sadak par ghayal laavaaris naa padaa rahe or log ghayalon kii madad ke liye protsaahit hon
 Hema malini-dharmendra's daughter and actress Isha Deol is going to be a mother again
 unhone ek intervyuu main bataaya ki unki beti radhya badi bahan banane ke liye kaaphi utsahit najar aati he

 mere pati bharat or main usase kehete hai ki aao or baby ko hai karo
 She comes and says hello baby
 isha ne kaha- jab main usase kahati hum ki baby kahaan he
 She points to the stomach and says here
 vah apni little doll ko bhi bottle se doodh pilaane lagati he
 After seeing all this, it seems that when Radhya is a child in real, she should love him like this
 isha duusari baar maa banane ko lekar kaaphi utsahit hai
 Recently, Isha shared a picture with Baby Bump

 Cash of more than 5 lakh rupees is taken through 500 or 1000 notes? If yes, what is the total amount of such cash donations? And details of donors who have given the closed notes to your party

 Staying in last place was a big shock for me

 Preparations for counting of votes for 87 seats of Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and 81 seats of Jharkhand have been completed
 mangalvaar subah sabase pehle postal ballat kii ginati kii jaaegi, phir iviem mashiinon main daale gayi vot gine jaaenge
 Whether the magic of PM Narendra Modi has worked in these two states or not, the picture will be clear by noon
 jammu kashmir main ab tak teen partiyon kii hi satta rahi he lekin is baar vahaan kaa raajnneetik mood alag he
 BJP can bring surprising results in the state
 haalanki vahaan kisi bhi party ko bahumat miltaa nahin dikh rahaa he lekin bijepi aisi sthiti main aati dikh rahi he jahaan se wo soobe main prabhavi bhoomika nibhaayegi
 The election of the c voter says that in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP can get 27 to 33 seats
 pidipi ko sabase zyada 38 siten milane kaa anumaan he jo ki bijepi se sirf 5 siten zyada he
 Although there does not seem to be any party getting a majority, but the 33 seats going to the BJP account are a big win for him
 bijepi ke liye jammu kashmir main 27 se 33 siten jeet laana, jeet ke baraabar he
 Because the party was never there except in parts of Jammu
 jammu kashmir mentrishanku vidhansabhake asarajammu kashmir main kiski sarkaar banegi? kya umr abdulla bijepi kaa saath denge? haalanki unhone to akele chalane kaa elaan kar diya he lekin siyasat main kuch pakkaa nahin hota
 On the other hand, speculation of Mehbooba Mufti forming a government with the Congress is also strong
 jammu kashmir main trishanku vidhansabha ke asaar pakke hai, to sawaal ye uthta he ki sarkaar kaise banegi, kiski banegi
 The PDP, which is seen emerging as the largest party, also needs support to form a government and BJP too cannot form a government on its own
 umr abdulla ne twit kar jab atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bharat ratna diye jane kii baat kahi to charchaa hone lagi ki jammu kashmir main bijepi kii siyaasi umradraj hone vaali he lekin unhone fouran kah diya ki wo kisi bhi dal ko samarthan nahin dege
 Here, Mehbooba Mufti is frozen in Delhi
 unki party ko sabase zyada siten bhi milti hui dikh rahi he, to kya ek baar phir congress pidipi kaa saath de sakati he, is baat kii sambhaavna majubat he kyonki pidipi bijepi ko satta se baahar rakhane ke liye congress kii ore haath badha sakati he
 The picture is currently blurred
 sab kuch is baat se tay hoga ki mangalvaar ko subah janata kaa paigaam kya aata he
 BJP government for the first time in Jharkhand! Here, opinion polls are saying that BJP can get 43 to 51 seats in Jharkhand
 agar aisa hua to 13 saal main pehali baar jharkhand main bijepi pehali baar bahumat se sarkaar bana legi, jiskaa asar bihar ke chunaavon par bhi pad saktaa he
 a hung assembly was formed in the state in the 2005 and 2009 assembly elections in Jharkhand
 yahaan pichley 14 saal main nau sarkarein baniin hai
 After the Lok Sabha elections, the process of release of the state is going on
 sabase pehle maharashtra or haryana se congress kaa safaya ho gaya
 BJP is ruling in both these states
 ab jharkhand bhi bijepi ke kabje main aata dikh rahaa he
 Opinion polls of India Today and Cicero say that this time BJP will win 43 to 51 seats there in the name of Narendra Modi
 bijepi ko 36 fisadi vot milane kaa anumaan he
 The closest competitor will be JMM, which will have to be satisfied with 14 to 18 seats
 suba banane ke baad ye pehla mauka hoga jab bijepi apane boote vahaan sarkaar bana sakegi
 The plunder and instability of many previous governments has forced people to look towards Narendra Modi
 jinhone ye naaraa diya ki aapaki tijori kholane kaa adhikaar sirf aapke paas hoga
 These poll surveys are saying that in the coming days, under the leadership of Modi, the BJP and the Barahoga will
 yaheen se puure vipaksh ke liye badi dikkat shuru ho rahi he

 10 lakh bank employees have been claimed to be involved in the strike of the federation of nine bank unions
 30 or 31 may ko hadtaal rahegi
 They say that the Indian Banking Association is deliberately delaying the decision on the demand for unions
 sarkaar bhi bankeron kii selary badhaane ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 Recently union talks were held with IBF, which proposed to increase 2% salary, which was not accepted by the bankers
 inkaa kahana he ki itnaa kaam karne ke baad agar 500, 1000 kii selary badhaane kaa prastaav unke saath mazaaq he
 His salary has not increased for five years
 is baat ko lekar banker kai dinon se prayaas kar rahe hai
 In Delhi too, bankers have gathered in front of State Bank Headquarters for their demand
 banker kaa kahana he ki bainkon kaa ghaataa unki galati ke kaaran nahin badha he
 The big industrialists took a loan of thousands of crores and did not go to the common banker
 unhone apana kaam eemaandaaree se kiya he
 Apart from this, now the bankers are implementing all the schemes of the government along with their original work
 har din yojanaon ko puraa karne kaa target diya jaataa he
 The target of selling insurance has become a problem for his life
 ise ham cross sailing kehete hai
 During the bank series, several bankers wrote a letter that their original work was being changed
 jab tak nishchit sankhya main beemaa nahin bechate hai tab tak ghar nahin jane diya jaataa he or shanivaar ravivaar ko bhi kaam karnaa padataa he
 When the decision on demonetisation was imposed on these bankers in 2016, they accepted the challenge and worked day and night
 aap jaanate hai ki is dauraan bainkon main karodon ke note aa gaye, jisase ginaney main galati hui
 Rotten throat notes arrived and fake notes also came

 zaahir he jahaan aap din ke 60-70 lakh note ginate hon, vahaan aap 5 karod 10 karod ginaney lagen to chook hogi
 Many banks did not even have a note counting machine at that time
 hamaare paas puri jaankaree nahin he ki saare kaitiyaron ne milakar notebandi ke samay kitna paisa apni jeb se jurmaana ke taur par diya he
 All these stories were hidden by the bankers, because they thought that the government would be happy with their renunciation and would increase their salary because their salary is becoming more
 aisa ye daawa karte hai
 During the bank series we were written by several women bankers that their branch does not even have a female toilet
 kai jagahon main to stri purush donon ke liye ek hi shauchalay he
 Female bankers say that only six months of maternity leave is available, while two years of child care leave is available in central government jobs

 Are these bankers responsible for the condition of the banks? 2012 main jo selary badhani thi wo 2015 ke ant main badi
 What should have increased in 2017 has not increased yet
 is dauraan bankeron kaa dhiraj jawaab de rahaa he kyonki unka karch nahin chal rahaa he
 The only solution to this is, Hindu bank syllabus and propaganda of dock media should be shown every hour in every bank every morning
 meraa vishwaas he ki ye log free main kaam karne lagenge
 However, the bankers did not benefit from running the series for several weeks at prime time

 Make a question to yourself, are there so many weak and negative bankers sitting in every bank that because of them, losses of up to 80,000 crores have been incurred or someone else will be responsible for this
 jaise ki sarkaar, prabandhan, udyogpati
 Today's Business Standard has a report that the NPA of the small finance bank has also gone up to 5-6 percent, from 1 percent in the year before demonetisation

 Business Standard itself has reported that 1 lakh 40 thousand crores have been added to the npas of 37 banks in the fourth quarter of 2017-18
 kya iske liye bhi aam banker zimmedaar he
 The facts should be looked at properly before making an assumption
 isliye bankeron ne apni maang patr main is baat ko shaamil kiya he ki aksar staff ko der tak kaam karne ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa he, uskaa samay darj ho
 Verbal orders should be discontinued, written orders for changes in the time of work
 kisi bhi staff ko lagaataar saat din se zyaada kaam karne ke liye baadhya na kiya jaae
 They should not work more than eight hours, they should be asked to work only 40 hours a week
 sabhi shanivaar ko chuttee he jo ab shaayad hi kabhi milti he
 Obviously, bankers have to do more than this
 tabhi unki mangapatr main in baton kaa zikr aayaa he
 There is also a demand that transfers should be discontinued for bullying and coercion
 maang patr ko dekhne se lagata he ki banker selary to chaahate hai magar kaam karne ke halaat main bhi bhayankar giravat ai he
 There is also a demand for pension which no one wants to talk about now
 vidhayak saansad khud pension lete hai magar dusron ko peshan na mili iske liye nitiyaan banaate hai

 If so, isn't it sad? 35 saal kii naukari ke baad 7000 laa nahin he
 They say that after working for four years and five years, they get six thousand in their hands
 sarkaar ko inhen bhi saatven vetan ayog kii selary deni chahie
 They do not even get pension
 modi sarkaar ke samay hi kamalesh chanda cameti bani thi, usne bhi selary badhaane kii baat kahi thi, magar nahin badhaai ja rahi he
 So rural post employees are on strike at different places in the country
 meri to samaj se baahar he ki ve 5000 kii selary par kaise guzaaraa karte honge
 Perhaps it is India that comes 99 percent who has nothing
 1 pratishat bharatiyon ke paas itani sampatti he jitani 70 pratishat bharatiyon kii sampatti ke paas he
 The comments aisa nahin he ki janata sangharsh nahin karti he, kar rahi he magar ho kya rahaa he

 But listen to the Gramin Dak Sevaks so that they do not feel that anyone should pay salary from the hearing
 35 saal kii naukari karte hue ye daksevak paikar maatr 7-8000 selary pate hai
 If so, isn't it sad? 35 saal kii naukari ke baad 7000 laa nahin he
 They say that after working for four years and five years, they get six thousand in their hands
 sarkaar ko inhen bhi saatven vetan ayog kii selary deni chahie
 They do not even get pension
 modi sarkaar ke samay hi kamalesh chanda cameti bani thi, usne bhi selary badhaane kii baat kahi thi, magar nahin badhaai ja rahi he
 So rural post employees are on strike at different places in the country
 meri to samaj se baahar he ki ve 5000 kii selary par kaise guzaaraa karte honge
 Perhaps it is India that comes 99 percent who has nothing

 No result is coming, maybe not
 gramin dak sevakon ke kai saare video aae hai
 Watching a trend in these videos
 surat ke kapadaa vyapaaree bhi jab andolan kar rahe the tab unka ek video aayaa tha
 In that video, they are singing songs, pleading pleasantly as someone does to their girlfriend, there is no outrage in those songs, Zindabad is not Murdabad, a similar video has been found, you see and understand that the Grameen Dak Sevak What do you want to say? hamane muzaffapur ke gramin dak sevak se baat kii
 They told that they have been taking postage to the villages since the British era
 postal vibhaag ke tahat kaam karte hai magar vibhaag unhen apana karmchaaree nahin maanate hai
 These people have won their battles against the Supreme Court and CAT but they are not yet recognized as employees
 jabaki ye gaanv-gaanv main cycle chalaakar chitthiyaan baantate hai
 Meanwhile, after increasing the price of petrol continuously for 16 days, it has become amazing today
 1 paise sasta ho gaya, jabaki antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat saadhe chaar dollar kam ho chuki he
 1 Do not underestimate the lack of money
 brake ke baad ham mandsaur or cancer par ek zaruri report dekhenge
 During the bank series, several bankers wrote a letter that their original work was being changed
 jab tak nishchit sankhya main beemaa nahin bechate hai tab tak ghar nahin jane diya jaataa he or shanivaar ravivaar ko bhi kaam karnaa padataa he
 When the decision on demonetisation was imposed on these bankers in 2016, they accepted the challenge and worked day and night
 aap jaanate hai ki is dauraan bainkon main karodon ke note aa gaye, jisase ginaney main galati hui
 Rotten throat notes arrived and fake notes also came
 isaki bharpai 20,000 selary paane vaale kaitiyaron ne 5000 se lekar 2-2 lakh tak apni jeb se kii he
 Many cashiers have written to us that they had to give 2 xxrep 4 0 out of their pocket and 48000 to someone
 zaahir he jahaan aap din ke 60-70 lakh note ginate hon, vahaan aap 5 karod 10 karod ginaney lagen to chook hogi
 Many banks did not even have a note counting machine at that time
 hamaare paas puri jaankaree nahin he ki saare kaitiyaron ne milakar notebandi ke samay kitna paisa apni jeb se jurmaana ke taur par diya he
 All these stories were hidden by the bankers, because they thought that the government would be happy with their renunciation and would increase their salary because their salary is becoming more
 aisa ye daawa karte hai
 During the bank series we were written by several women bankers that their branch does not even have a female toilet
 kai jagahon main to stri purush donon ke liye ek hi shauchalay he
 Female bankers say that only six months of maternity leave is available, while two years of child care leave is available in central government jobs
 agar ve bina selary ke chuttee leti hai to wo chuttee bhi aasaani se nahin milti hai
 His process is quite complex
 dilli main susheel mahapatra ne in sawaalon par kai mahila bankeron se lambii baat kii he
 Are these bankers responsible for the condition of the banks? 2012 main jo selary badhani thi wo 2015 ke ant main badi
 What should have increased in 2017 has not increased yet
 is dauraan bankeron kaa dhiraj jawaab de rahaa he kyonki unka karch nahin chal rahaa he
 The only solution to this is, Hindu bank syllabus and propaganda of dock media should be shown every hour in every bank every morning
 meraa vishwaas he ki ye log free main kaam karne lagenge
 However, the bankers did not benefit from running the series for several weeks at prime time
 hamane pataa kiya ki paanch saal naukari kar chuke clerk or manager ko haath main kitna miltaa he, taaki aap ek darshak ke taur par jaan saken ki jis bank kii naukari ko acchhee naukari samajha jaataa tha, aaj uski haalat kyon hui he
 The clerk with five years experience gets around 27000
 vahiin, paanch saal anubhav vaale afasar ko 32-34000 miltaa he
 Isn't it less how much work they do
 saare sarkari bank aitihaasik ghate se guzar rahe hai
 His condition is continuously deteriorating
 iske alag alag kaaran hai magar sabakaa prabhaav yahi he ki 2017-19 main bainkon kaa ghaataa ab kai hajaar karod kaa hone laga he
 We are going to report the losses of some banks
 punjab neshnal bank kaa ghaataa- 12, 282 karod, idibiai kaa ghaataa 8,237 karod, esbiai kaa ghaataa 6547 karod, bank of india kaa 6043 karod, oriental bank of carmas kaa ghaataa 5871 karod, union bank of india kaa ghaataa 5247 karod he
 Make a question to yourself, are there so many weak and negative bankers sitting in every bank that because of them, losses of up to 80,000 crores have been incurred or someone else will be responsible for this
 jaise ki sarkaar, prabandhan, udyogpati
 Today's Business Standard has a report that the NPA of the small finance bank has also gone up to 5-6 percent, from 1 percent in the year before demonetisation
 enpie matlab lone liya magar chukaa nahin paae
 Business Standard itself has reported that 1 lakh 40 thousand crores have been added to the npas of 37 banks in the fourth quarter of 2017-18
 kya iske liye bhi aam banker zimmedaar he
 The facts should be looked at properly before making an assumption
 isliye bankeron ne apni maang patr main is baat ko shaamil kiya he ki aksar staff ko der tak kaam karne ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa he, uskaa samay darj ho
 Verbal orders should be discontinued, written orders for changes in the time of work
 kisi bhi staff ko lagaataar saat din se zyaada kaam karne ke liye baadhya na kiya jaae
 They should not work more than eight hours, they should be asked to work only 40 hours a week
 sabhi shanivaar ko chuttee he jo ab shaayad hi kabhi milti he
 Obviously, bankers have to do more than this
 tabhi unki mangapatr main in baton kaa zikr aayaa he
 There is also a demand that transfers should be discontinued for bullying and coercion
 maang patr ko dekhne se lagata he ki banker selary to chaahate hai magar kaam karne ke halaat main bhi bhayankar giravat ai he
 There is also a demand for pension which no one wants to talk about now
 vidhayak saansad khud pension lete hai magar dusron ko peshan na mili iske liye nitiyaan banaate hai
 You are currently seeing pictures of Grameen Dak Sevaks from different places on the screen, for the last 17 days, Grameen Dak Sevaks across India have been on strike
 ye tasviren gramin dak sevakon kii hai, jo hairaan hai ki paune do lakh dak sevak hone ke baad bhi unki hadtaal ko kawarej nahin mil rahaa he
 When there is no discussion on a million bankers, then a quarter to two lakhs should also understand that real people do not come in media democracy
 in dak sevakon ko bhi poochna chahie ki hadtaal se pehle akhabaaron or channelon main kya dekh rahe the, kya pard rahe the, kya unhone apwaad chhodkar aam logon kii awaz dekhi he, jab nahin dekhi to unki awaz kaise nazar aegi

 You are currently seeing pictures of Grameen Dak Sevaks from different places on the screen, for the last 17 days, Grameen Dak Sevaks across India have been on strike
 ye tasviren gramin dak sevakon kii hai, jo hairaan hai ki paune do lakh dak sevak hone ke baad bhi unki hadtaal ko kawarej nahin mil rahaa he
 When there is no discussion on a million bankers, then a quarter to two lakhs should also understand that real people do not come in media democracy
 in dak sevakon ko bhi poochna chahie ki hadtaal se pehle akhabaaron or channelon main kya dekh rahe the, kya pard rahe the, kya unhone apwaad chhodkar aam logon kii awaz dekhi he, jab nahin dekhi to unki awaz kaise nazar aegi
 The rural posters saw it all
 sabzi bech lee, kapade utaar liye, tarah tarah kii bhangimaayein ain magar unka dil tut gaya
 He felt that his situation would be debated like the rest of the country
 ye faridabad ke daakghar kii tasviir he
 The strike has resulted in letters
 logon ke kitne zaruri kagaz nahin pahunch rahe honge
 But listen to the Gramin Dak Sevaks so that they do not feel that anyone should pay salary from the hearing
