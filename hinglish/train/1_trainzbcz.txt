 The debate in the film industry has started after actor Abhay Deol opened a Facebook front against Fairness Creams
 abhaya ne ferenes krims ko resism kaa pratik bataate hue inkaa vigyaapan karne vaale abhinaytaon ko aade haathon liya he
 Stars like Siddharth Malhotra, Deepika Padukone, Vidya Balan, Sonam Kapoor, John Abraham and Shah Rukh Khan have also not been spared in their Facebook posts
 abhaya ke post se aahat abhinetri sonam kapur ne unki bahan esha deol kii bhi ek tasviir post karte hue us par abhaya kii pratikriya maangi thi, jise abhaya ne galat bataaya tha
 However, due to dragging Abhay's sister, Sonam Kapoor was ridiculed, after which she deleted her tweet
 ab is vivaad main udai chopra kud gaye hai, unhone gorepan kaa daawa karne vaali krims kii tulana hair color se kar di he, is vajah se unhen twitor par kaaphi trol kiya ja rahaa he
 Uday Chopra tweeted, "what the hell is this about Fairness Creams? yadi ferenes kriim racist hai to hair color bhi hai
 It is a personal choice
 " What is this nonsense with fairness creams If fairness creams are racist then so is hair color
 It's a personal choice! # notracist — Uday Chopra (@udaychopra) April 14, 2017 Uday Chopra would have been fine even if he had stopped saying so, he even said that being blonde is a question of self esteem (ie self-respect)

 Modi 2
 0 sarkaar ke liye sansad main bhavy shuruyaat rahi
 In the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha, more than two dozen bills were introduced in the House and the government was able to pass most of them
 beete 15 saal main ye shuruaati or bajet satron main kisi bhi sarkaar kaa sabase acha pradarshan rahaa
 But at the same time, there has been an allegation from the opposition that the NDA government is forcing the House to pass the bills in any way
 aam chunaav main prachand jeet ke baad 17veen loksabhaa ke pehle satr main kaamkaaj kii raftaar ko bhi sarkaar jeet kii tarah le rahi he
 Data collected by India Today shows that the initial session has actually been a success for the government
 26 july tak modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main 30 bill pesh kiye
 Of these, the House passed 20 bills
 jahaan tak donon sadanon kaa sawaal he to 14 bill paas hue
 The highest number of bills have been passed since 2004 in the first or budget session of the Lok Sabha
 piares lejislative kii ore se sankalit data ke mutabik, 2004 main 14veen loksabhaa se lekar 2014 main 16veen loksabhaa tak pehle satron main koi vidhaayi kaamkaaj nahin hua
 In 2004, in the budget session which ran from July 5 to August 26, only 6 bills could be passed
 isi tarah 2009 main 15veen loksabhaa ke bajet satr (2 july se 7 agast) main mahaj 8 bill hi paas karaae ja sake
 In 2014, in the budget session of the 16th Lok Sabha, between July 7 and August 14, only 12 bills could be passed
 vahiin, vipaksh kaa aarope he ki sarkaar jaldbaaji main bill patake rahi he or ye bina kisi chaanbin ke paas karaae ja rahe hai
 Even the NDA ally Janata Dal United has warned the government on this issue
 congress saansad pradeep bhattacharya ne kaha, 'jis tareeke se sarkaar sadan main bill pesh kar rahi he or jis tarah unhen jaldbaaji main paas karaayaa ja rahaa he wo kisi ke hit main nahin he
 The kind of investigation that should be done on them is not being allowed to happen
 'jediu pravaktaa ke si tyaagi ne bhi bilon ko jis tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he, us par sawaal uthaaya
 Tyagi said, 'whether its UPA or NDA, their impartiality is questioned by the opposition
 sahi yahi he ki har party ko bill par vichaar karne kaa mauka mili
 As a Member of Parliament, my view is that if a bill wants to send a large number of mps to the committee within the stipulated time, then it should be done
 'sarkaar ne vipaksh ke in aaropon ko khaarij kiya ki loksabhaa main bahumat hone kii vajah se sarkaar kii ore se bilon ko jaldbaaji main paas karaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 BJP MP Vinay Sahastrabuddhe told India Today TV, 'it is not correct to say that the bills are being bulldozed
 agar sadan chahta ho to ham hameshaa bilon ko cametiyon ko bhejne ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin aksar sadan main charchaa kiye jane vaale bilon or pravar / sthaayee samitiyon main vichaar kiye gaye bilon main koi gunatmak parivartan nahin hota
 'when the standing committees of Parliament are yet to be contacted, there is no opportunity to examine the bills closely
 yahi kaaran he ki vipakshi dal bilon ko select cameti ko bhejne kii maang kar rahi hai
 Due to the extended session, further bills are expected to be introduced by 7 August

 dilli janalokapal bill 30 november ko vidhansabha main pesh kiya jayega
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia will place the bill in front of the House
 aaj tak ke paas kejariwal sarkaar ke us janalokapal bill kii exclusive copy he, jiskaa draft aane vaale dinon main pesh kiya janaa he
 In the bill, Jan Lokpal has been given many rights on one side, ranging from life sentence in corruption cases to investigation in such cases
 vahiin janalokapal kii chayan samiti ke chaar sadasyon main mukhyamantri se lekar dilli vidhansabha adhyaksh ko sadsy banaaya gaya he
 Also, the Lieutenant Governor has been excluded from the selection process
 kejariwal sarkaar kaa sabase ahm muddakejariwal sarkaar kaa sabase bada mudda janalokapal hi rahaa he
 The session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly was extended for a week only so that this bill could be passed by the Legislative Assembly
 nae janalokapal bill ke daayre main rajdhani ke andar kaam kar rahe sabhi vibhaagon ke bhrashtachar se jude maamalon kii jaanch janalokapal karegaa, jinamein centre sarkaar ke dilli police, didie or emsidi jaise vibhaag bhi shaamil he
 The authority to punish Janlokpal has been given the right to sentence from 6 months to life imprisonment in cases of corruption
 bhrashtachar kii vajah se hone vaale aarthik nuksaan kii paanch guna raashi tak bhrashtachariyon se vasuulne kaa praavdhaan bhi he
 But there is a possibility of controversy over the fact that apart from the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, three other leaders have been included in the four members of the Lokpal inquiry committee
 in teenon main mukhyamantri, vipaksh ke netaa or vidhansabha adhyaksh shaamil hai
 The Lt
 Governor will not be involved in the selection process and will also be bound to accept the decision of the Selection Committee in 30 days
 prashanth bhushan ne khadey kiye sawalbil main kahin bhi ye zikr nahin he ki janalokapal mukhyamantri yaa mantrimandal ke sadasyon kii jaanch kaise karegaa
 Prashant Bhushan, who was the pivot of the first Lokpal movement, has also raised questions about this
 Delhi Lokpal bill trashes all principles of an Ind Janlokpal that we had drafted: Appt & removal not under govt; Ind Inv agency under Lokpal— Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1)november 27, 2015sutron kii maane, to janalokapal teen sadasyon kii ek cameti hogi, jisamen do sadsy or ek adhyaksh hoga
 The Speaker should be the judge of the Supreme Court or High Court
 lokapal kaa kaarykaal paanch saal kaa hoga or inhen dilli vidhansabha main do-tihaai sadasyon ke prastaav par uparajyapal kii anumati se hataaya tak ja sakegaa
 Janlokpal will be able to appoint Janlokpal Investigating Officer, who will have all the powers of investigation with the police
 faisle ko nahin di ja sakati chunautilokapal jaanch ke liye kisi bhi kendriya agency or kisi anya rajya yaa centreshasit pradesh kii jaanch agency kii madad lene ko bhi swatantra hoga
 The bill also states that any decision of the Lokpal will not be challenged in any other court
 kejariwal sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main vidhansabha main janalokapal bill pesh karne kaa faisla to kar liya he
 But the opponents will definitely find loopholes to target the government, which the government will have to answer before passing the bill

 During this, BJP in-charge of Bihar Bhupendra Yadav and LJP MP Chirag Paswan were also present
 darasal, pichley kai dinon se bihar main seat shering ke lekar endie ke bich manthan chal rahaa he
 The LJP had put this formula in front of the BJP leadership to give them 5 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar and one seat of Rajya Sabha from Assam by BJP for Ram Vilas Paswan
 algepi ko rajyasabha seat dene ke badale wo bihar main apni ek seat bijepi ke liye chhod degi, lekin bijepi is par raji nahin ho rahi thi
 If LJP formula is also agreed, BJP will contest 18 seats, JDU 17 seats and LJP 5 seats

 bihar main jithan ram maanjhi ab khulkar vidhayakon se apil kar rahe hai ki yadi mantri bananaa ho, to hamaare saath aao yani dal-badal kii khuleam apil kii ja rahi he
 This is rarely seen in Bihar

 He has laddoos in both hands, as both Nitish and Manjhi offer him ministerial posts from the camp
 magar sabase bada sawaal yah he ki bijepi is aag main ghi kyon jhonk rahi he? kya bijepi ko yah nahin pataa ki unki sankhya jod den, uske baavjood bahumat kaa aankada puraa nahin ho rahaa
 If the BJP feels that Manjhi will break more than 30 mlas, then it can be done
 bihar main kul 38 aisi siten hai, jo daliton ke liye rirjav hai
 If all the Dalit mlas and some such mlas, who feel that Nitish Kumar will not give them a ticket, can come together, then they can cross Manjhi's boat
 abhi jediu ke paas 19, bijepi ke paas 18 or argedy ke paas ek dalit vidhayak hai, yani jediu ke sabhi dalit vidhayak maanjhi ke saath chale bhi jaaen, to bhi maanjhi ko 15 gaiyr-dalit vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie
 Manjhi is close to the BJP since 1991
 1991 main maanjhi gaya loksabhaa kaa upachunaav congress ke tikat par lade the
 At that time, BJP workers supported Manjhi and the BJP candidate was defeated
 yahi nahin maanjhi ne apane sabase bade bete ko sangh parivaar ko daan main diya hua he
 People of Bihar know all these things
 maanjhi jab dilli main mukhyamantri ke taur par pradhanmantri se mili, to kaha, main aapaki vajah se hi mukhyamantri bana hum
 In this backdrop, it is not surprising that Manjhi sits in the BJP fold
 bijepi nahin chaahati he ki kisi bhi haalat main nitish kumaar mukhyamantri kii kursi par baithen, kyonki yadi nitish ne acha kaam kiya or halaat ko sambhaal liya, to bijepi ke liye kaaphi dikkatein paidaa ho sakati hai
 After losing the Delhi Assembly elections, all the strength of BJP is going to be in Bihar itself
 ab shuukravaar ko hone vaale vishwaas mat ke dauraan spikar par kaaphi kuch nirbhar karegaa, kyonki spikar ne jediu ko vipakshi dal kaa darja de diya he, yani maanjhi kii naiya bijepi paar lagaati he yaa phir maanjhi apni naiya khud dubote hai

 puraa parivaar behad khushhaal tha
 But on the intervening night of August 4 and 5, what arose in Marcello's mind that he shot both his mother and father one by one from his father's service revolver
 iske baad usne apni do naniyon ko bhi bilkul point blank range se golimar unki jaan le lee
 But what if at night, the next day nobody felt his act in the morning, because after killing four people, he got out of his house and went to school with ease as early as the next morning
 uske chehre par na to apane kiye kii koi shikan thi, or na hi pakade jane kaa koi khuf, balki marcelo hameshaa kii tarah 5 agast ko bhi tamaam classes nipataane ke baad skool se ghar lautaa
 But here another big incident was waiting for him, because after four to four murders, there was now a fifth bullet in this house
 is baar ye goli khud marcelo par chali
 It was overflowing
 akhir, marcelo kii is kahani kaa sach kya tha? chaar-chaar logon kii jaan lenevaale marcelo kii jaan kisne lee?maasoom marcelo ke sir par ek aisa fitur savaar tha, jisane use sabase nanhee umr kaa serial killer bana diya
 But after killing his parents at his own hands, he could not forgive himself and then he shot the last bullet on his own head
 13 saal ke schuli bachche marcelo ke dimag main us raat jo fitur savaar tha, yah ab bhi pulisavaalon ke liye ek paheli he, kyonki 4 or 5 agast kii darmyaani raat ko apane hi mata-pita samet chaar logon kii jaan lene ke baad agle din skool se lautakar marcelo ne khud ko bhi maar kar lee thi
 When the sao-pavlo police came to know of this murder in a family in the area, they threw all their strength to find out the truth
 darasal, police ko pehle yah shaq tha ki kahin kisi gang ne ghar main ghuskar marcelo ke puure parivaar qatl to nahin kar daalaa? kyonki vaise to bhi marcelo ke mata-pita, donon police main the or unki badmaashon se puraani dushmani ho sakati thi
 But when the police inspected his house and the surrounding area, the whole story was cleared up
 awwal to marcelo ke ghar main kisi ke jabaran daakhil hone ke nishaan nahin mili or naa hi ghar ke baahar lage sisitivi camere main aisi koi tasviir hi qaid hui, jabaki aadhi raat ko kisi ke liye chupchaap yun ghar main ghus kar chaar logon kii jaan lenaa mumkin nahin tha
 Anyway, if a murderer had come from outside, why would he have spared Marcelo, while Marcello had left his house the next morning of the crime
 duusari ore, police ko marcelo ke ghar ke baahar lage sisitivi camaron main naa sirf marcelo ghar se baahar nikalate hue dikhaa, balki skool main bhi uske class atand karne kii baat saafe ho gai
 However, after knowing what Marcello's innocent friends had revealed about him, the policemen's ears were definitely raised
 marcelo ke sabase qareebi dost ne police ko bataaya ki marcelo aksar bada hokar hitman yani supaari killer banane kii khwaahish jataayaa karata tha
 He even told this friend once that he would first shoot his own parents and then run away from home and join the world of crime
 is bachche kaa bayaan police ke liye ek ahm subut sabit hua
 But in the investigation of this case of five deaths, many more such shocking things were revealed, which ended the possibility of suspicion of innocent Marcello being murdered by his parents
 police ne paaya ki marcelo ne apane fasebuk main 21 disambar ko ek aisa states apadet kiya tha, jo uski is karatuut se hu-ba-hu mail khaati thi
 Marcelo uploaded a popular picture of the infamous Amateville Murder Case of America on 31 November 1974
 duniya bhar main ametivile ghost bvoy ke naam se charchit is tasviir main ek aise bachche kaa cheharaa dikhne kaa daawa kiya jaataa he, jisaki do saal pehle hue ametivile narsanhaar main maut ho gai thi
 In the Amateville massacre, six people of the same family were killed by a son of the same family, who is still in jail
 ab jis tarah se marcelo ne apane puure parivaar kaa safaaya kar khudakushi kii he, wo bhi ametivile kii vaardaat se kaaphi had tak milti-julati he
 Apparently, it was the fate of the betel nut killer that first made Marcello the killer of the whole family and then in despair, he gave his own life

 Road Construction Minister Nandkishore Yadav said in the Legislative Assembly that Tejashwi Yadav had not received any marriage proposal on the departmental whatsapp number while being the Minister of Road Construction
 nandakishor yadav ne daawa kiya, 'maine khud isaki jaanch kii thi
 When Tejashwi was Bihar's road construction minister, a whatsapp number was issued by the department to get information about the bad roads of the state
 baad main khabar ai thi ki is number par kharaab sadakon ke bare main jaankaree kam or tejasvi yadav ke liye vivaah ke prastaav zyada aa rahe hai
 Then there were reports that 40 thousand girls at that number had proposed marriage in front of Tejashwi
 lekin vartmaan path nirmaan mantri nandakishor yadav ne sadan main bayaan dete hue kaha ki us number par tejasvi yadav ke liye koi vivaah kaa prastaav nahi aayaa tha
 i have investigated this myself
 is bayaan ke baad raajnneeti garma gai

 varsh 1984 main pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad rajeev gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaaya gaya tha
 Rajiv Gandhi's tenure is remembered for many important decisions
 unamem ek sabase ahm faisla tha ki 18 saal ke yuvaaon ko matdaan karne kaa adhikaar dena
 On 20 December 1988, legislation was approved in Parliament to reduce the voting age from 21 to 18 years
 saal ke aakhri maheene kaa 20waan din isiilie yuvaaon ke liye khaas mana jaataa he

 chaatro kaa kahana he ki notebandi ke baad ye note kisi kaam ke nahin hai, aise main ham ise wo vailu dene kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, jo inaki keemat badha detaa he
 NID professor Praveen Singh Solanki says that through the use of this scrap, students are also supporting the Prime Minister's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, because such a large number of notes that have been canceled, are making things for home use
 dilachasp baat yah he ki ye note aise matirial se taiyaar hue hai jo na to jaldi pani main galata he or na hi is kaa rang chhutata he
 In such a situation, things lasting for a long time can be made easily
 enaidi ab in scrap note ke liye pratispardhaa kaa bhi aayojan karne vaali he, taaki inke istemaal karne ke nae-nae tareeke chaatr dhundh paaen

 Rajasthan Chief Ministervsundhara Raje is taking out the Gaurav Yatra on an election chariot to count the achievements of his government
 mewar se shuru hui raaje kii yatra kaa doosraa charan marwar main khatm hua
 But Kirodi Singh Bainsla, who agitated with the demand for ethnic reservation, may put a break on his journey ahead
 gurjar-rebaari-rajput gathjod banane kii kavaydadrasal gurjar netaa kirodi singh bansla aarakshan ke mudde par gurjar, rebaari orrajputsamaj ko sarkaar ke khilaaf ekajute karne kii kavayad main jute hai
 a glimpse of which he has given to the leaders of the Rebari community in Jodhpur by promising support to the demand for reservation under the Special Backward Castes (SBC)
 rebaari samudaay jinhen devasi or raika ke naam ke bhi janaa jaataa he, gwaalon kaa ek samudaay he jo mukhyat: gaay charaate hai
 This community is found in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Karnataka besides Rajasthan

 However, during this time former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee died
 lihaaja mukhyamantri ne kuch dinon ke liye sabhi kaarykram radd kar diye
 Why are Rajputs angry? The Rajput fraternity of Rajasthan is also demanding reservation in jobs and education under the Other Backward Castes (OBC)

 jiske baad yah tay hua ki mukhyamantri raaje kii yatra kaa bharatpur sambhag ke gurjar bahul savai madhopur or karauli jile main virodh kiya jayega
 This protest against the Vasundhara government among the Rajputs is due to reasons other than reservation, including the neglect of bjp's strongman Jaswant Singh and the absence of Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as BJP state president
 bataa den ki gaurav yatra ke dauraan marwar kshetra ke jodhpur sambhag kii 33 main se 32 vidhansabha kshetron main mukhyamantri kii sabhaaon kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 But he did not include just one assembly constituency in his journey and this area is Shiva Vidhan Sabha of Barmer, where Jaswant Singh's son Manvendra Singh is an MLA from BJP
 gaurav yatra main shiv vidhansabha kshetra kii andekhi ko jasol parivaar se mukhyamantri kii naaraazgi se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 However, during the conclusion of Gaurav Yatra in Marwar, Raja of Jodhpur and former MP Gaj Singh are seen with Vasundhara
 maharaja gaj singh kaa rajputon main acha khaasaa prabhaav he
 At the same time, many political meanings are being extracted behind Jaswant Singh's influence in Barmer with his Raje
 vasundhara kii koshish hui nakambansla kaa kahana he ki aarakshan par sarkaar kii niti der karo, inkaar karo kii he
 The community is already agitating for the demand for 5 percent reservation
 to vahiin aarakshan kii maang ko lekar rebaari or rajput samaaj bhi hamaare saath he
 Bainsla says that Brahmin society should also join them in this alliance
 udhar chunavi maahaul main bansla kii naaraazgi ko shant karne ke liye mukhyamantri kii taraf se vaarta ke liye pichley shuukravaar ko aamantrit bhi kiya gaya tha
 But in this dialogue, Gurjar leader Himmat Singh also reached Bansla's Gurjar Reservation Conflict Committee
 lekin afasaron ne bansla gut se hi vaarta kii
 Bainsla says that the committee will oppose the Gaurav Yatra until their demands are met

 kai saal pehle kii baat he
 Anand Mohan Chhaparwal, an Ayurvedic entrepreneur, was listening to the story of a friend suffering from heart attack
 vah lambey samay se chale aa rahe ilaaj or hospital ke badhate bill se pareshaan tha
 Hearing this, he got the idea in his mind that why the age old Ayurveda has no cure for it? He scrutinized the ancient texts, studied them, talked to old Vaidyas and newly educated Ayurvedic practitioners
 unhone laboratory main khud vaigyanikon or vaidyon kii sevaayen lekar kai saal tak research karwaai
 As a result, two products fell into his hands
 heart atake kii ashanka khatm karne vaali aushadhi hriday kavach or silent killer diabetes kaa dushman diabegon
 Both drugs produced surprising results
 chhaparwaal daawa karte hai ki in rogon kaa ilaaj puri tarah prakritik dhang se hota he or mahangi heart surgery kii jarurat nahin ke baraabar rah jaati he
 Chhaparwal, managing director of Deendayal medicine, who brings these two products, proudly says that due to research, Ayurveda has helped in the natural treatment of other physical problems along with diseases
 ve bataate hai ki prachinkaal se blad pressure ke liye rudraksh dhaaran karne kii salaah di jaati rahi he
 Many people wear Rudraksha beads
 bataate hai ki isse hriday kii dhadkan niyantran main rahati he
 Using this belief, the heart armor drug has been prepared
 isi prakaar diabetes ke upachaar ke liye jamun kaa sirka istemaal karke nai aushadhi diabegon taiyaar kii gai he
 Chhaparwal explains that he has designed his products of medicines keeping in mind the needs of every generation
 ''ayurveda kaa siddhant he ki biimaar padane se pehle sanket mil jaae to uskaa upachaar thik dhang se kiya jaae
 Especially the new generation should be given solutions for wellness and health
 isliye paaramparik chuuran-chatnee kii bajaae capsule or tablet form main aushadhiyaan uplabdh karai gai hai
 "chhaparwal says that some time ago the Ayurvedic system of medicine was far less than allopathy
 kaaran yah tha ki ayurvedic product ko log chuuran-chatnee samajhate the or ilaaj ko neem hakim vaala
 His company focused on attracting the product
 ab chuuran-chatnee kii jagah ayurvedic dawaaen ve seerup, capsule, tablet or granules ke form main utaarte hai
 The company's research division is focusing heavily on the packaging and marketing of the product
 iske alaava, marketing bhi joardaar dhang se kii jaati he
 "earlier people were afraid to go to the police and lawyers, but today they are scared of the name of hospital and treatment," says Safer rafta-raftachhaparwal, referring to the atmosphere created about doctors and hospitals
 iskaa kaaran yahi he ki ilaaj main kharch or usase judi samasyaayein zyada hai
 In such a situation, Ayurveda has caught everyone's attention
 " iske alaava unke paas kai peedhishon kaa 250 saal kaa anubhav tha
 Today his company is making 600 types of Ayurvedic products
 life style ne jo bimaariyaan nai peedi main paidaa kii hai, unka nidaan bhi ayurveda ne diya he
 In the family of Chhaparwal, who gave the growing business of Deendayal medicine as a modern company, in fact, Ayurveda was being worked on for many generations
 dinadayal indrustries kii sthapana 1927 main kii gai thi or research ke jariye company ne kai ayurveda product viksit kiye
 Today the company's business is Rs 50 crore

 There will be research on Ayurveda with BAMS degree in this college
 iske alaava gwalior main ek ayurveda resort banane kii bhi planning he
 Chhaparwal believes that this type of resort has great potential as the climate of Gwalior is dry and hot and this environment is very effective in treating many diseases
 multinational banane kii taiyaarichhaparwaal ko is baat kaa sukun he ki centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne ayurveda ke mahatv ko samajha he or iske liye ek alag aayush mantralay banaaya gaya he
 The company has conducted a TQS audit to ensure Deendayal Pharmaceutical's products can survive in the international market
 chhaparwaal kaa daawa he ki company ke product is audit ke maandand par khare utre hai or dinadayal aushadhi ab multinational banane ke liye taiyaar he
 "the company has obtained all the certificates from which drugs are recognized in every market
" "chunautiyaan bhi kam nahinchhaaparwaal ko is kshetra main sambhaavnaaon ke alaava chunautiyon kaa bhi ilm he
 Ayurveda has a new market compared to allopathy in the changed environment and has to work among people
 ve bataate hai, ''chunki hindustan kii companiyon kaa market share bad rahaa he, is vajah se ab kai multinational companiyaan is field main aane ke liye taiyaar ho rahi hai
 "competition is bound to increase with such companies coming into the market, because their marketing is very strong and they invest a lot of capital
 dinadayal aushadhi limited iske liye bhi taiyaar he
 The size of the company's marketing and sales team is being increased
 in donon mahakamon main workforce 170 se badhaakar 250 tak kii ja rahi he
 So in the coming times they are ready to meet every challenge
 iske alaava metro shaharon main ayurvedic product ke store bhi khole jaaenge
 Deendayal medicine after making medicines for diseases of heart and diabetes, is now focusing on medicines for liver hepatitis b and other diseases
 is disha main 12 saal se research jari he
 The company also organizes such camps in which patients come and get free advice
 chhaparwaal bataate hai ki ''jivaji uniwarsity kii madad se diabetes ke marijon kaa vishesh upachaar kiya jaataa he
 More than 70,000 patients have undergone their tests so far
 isse diabetes par research main bahut madad mili he
 "deendayal medicine has taken up another ambitious program

 The process of seeking evidence of leaders has started after the Indian Air Force attacked the terrorist bases in Pakistan
 saboot maangane vaale netaaon kii list main ab patna sahib se saansad or bijepi ke netaa shatrughna sinha bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 Shatrughan Sinha, popularly known as Bihari Babu, has also asked for evidence of an air strike in Pakistan by standing his government in the dock
 apni party or sarkaar par lagaataar nishaanaa saadhane vaale shatrughna sinha bhala is maukey par chup kaise rahete, isliye patna pahunchate hi unhone apane baagi sur chhedate hue kaha ki alag-alag channel par sarkaar kaa alag-alag numaayinda kah rahaa he ki 300 aatanki maare gaye to koi kah rahaa he 500 aatanki maare gaye
 In such a situation, along with the people of the country, the entire opposition also wants to know how many terrorists were killed
 unhone kaha ki sena kii parakram kii kahani ke saath strike ko kis had tak anjaam diya gaya, desh yah bhi jaananaa chahta he
 He further said that if the Central Government reveals this data, then i understand that the people of the country will also be encouraged
 sachai saamne aegi to sarkaar kii vaahvahee hogi
 However, he has also said that he has no doubt about the might of the army
 sena kaa kaam prashansaneey or anukaraniya he lekin iske saath saath desh kii janata kuch baaten jaananaa chaahati he to isamen buraai kya he
 Shatrughan Sinha did not stop here
 unhone congress ke netaa digvijay singh kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 Who called the Pulwama attack an accident
 is par pratikriya dete hue bihari babu ne kaha ki main itnaa kahuunga ki digvijay singh bahut paripakv aadmi hai
 It looks like he wanted to say something and the words went out a bit more
 duusari taraf bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki air strike ko lekar koi raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Nitish Kumar said that the air strike that the army has done by going to Pakistan
 usase desh ke logon kaa sena ke prati sammaan badha he
 Significantly, BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha has been rebelling against his party for a long time
 kai aise maukey aae jab shatrughna sinha ishaaron main hi apni party par nishaanaa sadhate nazar aae
 Shatrughan Sinha's proximity to opposition parties has also surfaced
 shatrughna sinha do baar se bijepi ke taraf se patna sahib se saansad rah chuke hai
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the ticket is being decided from the Lok Sabha constituency on behalf of the BJP
 lekin shatrughna sinha ne yah saaf kar diya he ki wo isi loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladenge
 Ireland won the title by defeating Afghanistan by five wickets in the final of the World Twenty20 qualifying tournament
 donon hi team final main jagah banaakar srilanka main hone vaale tii20 vishwa cap ke liye kwalifai kar chuki hai
 Afghanistan, who won all eight matches in the qualifier before the final, achieved the target with seven balls remaining after Ireland were held to 152 for seven in 20 overs

 unhone apni pari main nau chauke or teen chakke jade or is dauraan tii20 itihaas kaa doosraa sabase tej ardhashatak jamaaya
 Earlier, Afghanistan wicket-keeper Mohammad Shahzad played a crucial role in bringing the team's score to 150 runs in 57 balls with the help of 77 fours and two sixes
 sterling ne puure toornament ke dauraan shandaar pradarshan kiya or 11 maichon main sarvaadhik 357 ran banaae

 vidambnaa dekhie ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main prachaar ke dauraan bhartiya janata party ne manmohan singh kii congress sarkaar ko aarthik nitiyon par jamkar kosa
 During the campaign, the Bharatiya Janata Party offered an alternative economic policy to the Congress as an alternative and came to power
 vidambnaa yah ki 1980 main bani is party ke paas koi spasht aarthik niti nahin thi or ab lagbhag chaar saal tak satta par kabiz rahane ke baad vikalp dena to dur kaha ja saktaa he ki donon bhartiya janata party or congress party kii aarthik niti main koi antar nahin he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has opposed the social and economic policies of the Congress and held it responsible for the weak growth rate and corruption
 jahaan congress kii aarthik nitiyaan saarvajanik kshetra ko kendra main rakhte hue desh main samaajawaadee sanrachana ko badhaava dene ke liye raheen
 At the same time, after coming to power, the Bharatiya Janata Party was based on the initiative to strengthen the economy, keeping major economic reforms at the center
 lihaaja, congress bhartiya janata party ko apane kaarykaal ke dauraan asangat nijeekaran karne kaa aarope lagaati he
 Now, if we evaluate the economic policies of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, it is seen that a major reshuffle has been recorded in the party's economic policy
 vipaksh main baithi bhartiya janata party congress kii jin nitiyon kaa virodh karti rahi vahiin satta main aane ke baad un nitiyon kaa anusaran karne main use hichak nahin hui
 Actually, many streams of economic policies are prevalent even within the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ise padhein: modi sarkaar ke in 10 faislon se bad gai he yogi sarkaar kii chunautiyambhartiya janata party kii 1980 main sthapana ke vakt party kii aarthik niti purv kii jansangh kii tarah rahi jahaan rashtriya swanyasevak sangh or anya sambhddha sanghathanon kii nitiyon ko apanaaya gaya
 During this period, the party raised the slogan of Swadeshi and emphasized on domestic production and favored a protectionist policy in exports
 iske saath hi party ne congress kii us audyogic niti kaa virodh kiya jiske kendra main sarkari companiyon ko rakhaa gaya
 But during the 1996 elections, the party completely changed its stance and started emphasizing globalization instead of protectionism
 party ke chunavi ghoshnaa patr main praathmik kshetron main bade videshi nivesh kii baat kahi
 Then as soon as the government came to power in 1998, the party further cemented its policies in favor of globalization
 iske chalate bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaali pehali endie sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan badi sankhya main videshi companiyon kaa bharat main aagaman hua
 The special thing is that while the RSS and other allied organizations (swadeshi Jagran Manch) remained opposed to these policies, their opposition calmed down after the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party government
 aarthik nitiyon main is badlaav ke baad vipakshi dal or khaastaur par vampanthi dalon ne bhartiya janata party par aarope madha ki uski nitiyaan america or vishwa bank ko khush karne kii niyat se nirdhaarit kii gai hai
 However, during this period the RSS also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of turning away from the issue of Swadeshi
 bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaali 1998 se 2004 tak do sarkaron ke kaarykaal ke dauraan sarkari companiyon kaa bade str par nijeekaran karne kaa kaam kiya saath hi kai kshetron main aviniman kiya
 During this time, the party also took important initiatives to clear the way for foreign companies to enter India
 haalanki bhartiya janata party ke ye faisle 1991 main congress party dwaara aarthik udaarikaran kii nitiyon par chalane ke faisle ko kendra main rakhane hue kiya gaya
 The result of this decision was seen by the Bharatiya Janata Party and during its tenure the GDP growth rate registered a good pace
 ise padhein: share bazaar ke baad petrol kii keemton ne bhi choda modi sarkaar kaa saathisi nattejey ko aadhaar banaate hue bhartiya janata party ne 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle shining india kaa masauda rakhaa
 With this draft, the party also clarified its policy that only through free trade can all sectors of society be upgraded
 aarthik niti main yah badlaav sirf rashtriya str par dekhne ko nahin mila
 This policy was also initiated in the Bharatiya Janata Party-governed major states and as a result, there was a good growth in the growth rate in the party-ruled states
 iske baad 2004 se lekar 2014 tak ek baar phir bhartiya janata party vipaksh main baithi
 During this time the party once again started opposing the economic policies of the Congress
 baat desh main ek kar vyavastha lagu karne kii ho to party ne congress ke masaude ko puri tarah nakaar diya
 Or else, before the Congress government increased the income tax, it was argued to completely eliminate the income tax system
 lekin 2014 main jab party satta main vaapasi karti he to usee jiesti ko sabase bade sudhaar ke taur par lagu kiya gaya
 At the same time, during the last four years, the logic of abolishing the income tax has been done to increase the government's income, constantly increasing the tax range
 lihaaja, yah kaha jaae ki satta main baithi congress or bijepi kii aarthik niti main koi antar nahin he to iske paksh main majboot tark sarkaar ne kaarykaal ke dauraan pesh kiya he

 Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu has accused the BJP of promoting regional agitation and unrest in the state
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki endie main bijepi sirf kamjor saathiyon ko rakhana chaahati he
 In an interview to the Economic Times newspaper, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader n Chandrababu Naidu said that the BJP is doing injustice to Andhra Pradesh for its political gains and by not fulfilling the promise of giving special status to the state, the people of Andhra Is punishing unhone kaha ki bijepi yah samaj nahin paa rahi ki andhra pradesh ke vikaas ko nuksaan pahunchaa kar vah bharat ke vikaas ko bhi baadhit kar rahi he
 Significantly, Chandrababu Naidu is on a two-day Delhi tour
 unke dilli daure kaa agenda kya he, is bare main sawaal par unhone kaha, 'meraa agenda andhra ke saath hone vaale anyaay ko desh ke saamne laana, centre sarkaar par dabaav bananaa or anya kshetreey dalon kaa samarthan jutanaa he
 i would urge the leaders of other parties to raise this issue in Parliament by supporting us
 'kya vah centre main kisi tisare morche ke banane kaa samarthan karenge, is sawaal par chandrababu naidu ne kaha, 'philhal to meri praathamikta andhra kaa hit he
 TDP has always believed that regional leadership is closer to the people and therefore it will continue to help strengthen regional parties in the backdrop of cooperative federalism
 'bijepi se rishte kharaab hone kii kya vajah rahi, kya bijepi ne andhra main 10loksabhaaor 50 vidhansabha siton kii maang kii thi, iske jawaab main naidu ne kaha, 'bijepi ne aisi koi maang nahin kii thi
 If there was such a demand, i would have rejected it
 na to bijepi andhra pradesh main itani majboot he or na hi meri lokapriyata itani kam hui he
 We partnered with BJP in 2014 only to see the interest of Andhra Pradesh
 bijepi ke saath hamaare rishte kharaab hone kii vajah yah he ki use wiesar congress jaise kamjor saathi pasand hai, jo bhrashtachar ke maamle kaa saamana kar rahe hai or jin par niyantran hasil karnaa aasaan he
 He said, 'despite the BJP breaking the alliance in Telangana unilaterally within a year, we continued the relationship in Andhra
 hamane chaar saal is ummid main kaate ki bijepi rajya ke bare main apane vaade ko puraa karegi, iske baad hamane endie choda
 He alleged that the BJP was promoting unrest in Andhra
 unhone kaha, 'jab maine andhra ke hiton kii raksha ke liye aawaaj uthaai, to bijepi neroilsimaamen kshetreey andolan ko uksaana shuru kar diya
 Despite being a regional party, we have a more national attitude, whereas BJP, despite being a national party, is resorting to regionalist movements

 The New Year is welcomed around the world with great pomp, enthusiasm and gaiety

 Even in different provinces of our country, the New Year is welcomed in different ways, but in many places the traditions and customs of celebrating the New Year are so bizarre that people are surprised to know about them
 sambhavat: duniya bhar main bharat hi ekmaatr aisa desh he, jahaan nav varsh ek se adhik baar or vividh roopon main manaaya jaataa he

 However, whatever be the traditions of celebrating the new year, everyone has the same objective and that new year is full of happiness, peace and prosperity
 aaie jaanate hai, bharat ke vibhinn hisson main kaise manaaya jaataa he navvarsh :maharashtra : nav varsh ke shubh avasar par ek saptaah pehle hi gharon kii chhaton par reshmi pataakaa fahraai jaati he

 It is believed that eating them keeps the body healthy throughout the year
 rajasthan : navvarsh ke vishesh avasar par gud se bane pakwaan khaanaa bahut shubh mana jaataa he taaki varmbhar munh se madhur boli hi nikalati rahe

 Uttarakhand MLA Pranab Singh Champion was expelled by the Bharatiya Janata Party due to dancing with revolver and alcohol
 jabaki unnav balaatkaar maamle main ek saal se jail main band vidhayak kuldeep singh senger bijepi ke gale kii fans ban gaye hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that Kuldeep Sengar's crime is less than Pranav Champion, due to which BJP has not expelled Sengar from the party so far
 Even in the assembly elections, he increased the seat of the party
 lekin vipaksh ke akramak tevar se bijepi baikfoot par najar aa rahi he
 From Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi to SP President Akhilesh Yadav, everyone is questioning the BJP as to why they have remained in the party till now

 The MLA has been booked for murder
 vipaksh ne chautarafa yah sawaal uthaanaa shuru kar diya he ki bijepi senger ko kyon dho rahi he
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, while making a scathing attack on the BJP, has asked why the accused in the Unnao rape case is still in that party

 a road accident with a rape victim is a shocking incident
 saath hi dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne to bijepi se sidhe poocha he ki ab tak unhen party se barkhaast kyon nahin kiya gaya

 After this Kuldeep Sengar surrendered after going to SSP office
 sibiai ne jab is maamle main chargeshit daakhil kii tab kahin jaakar bijepi ne senger ko party se nilambit kiya tha
 On the other hand, a video of BJP MLA Pranav Singh Champion from Uttarakhand went viral, in which Champion was seen dancing with revolver and alcohol
 ise lekar bijepi kii jamkar kirakiri hui thi
 After this, the BJP showed the MLA Champion a way out of the party
 jabaki kuldeep singh senger par balaatkaar or hatya ke aarope hai

 kehete hai bivi sabakuch bardaasht kar sakati he, shuhar kii bewafaai bardaasht nahin kar sakati
 And the husband who is preparing to bring the son to the house, his wife's condition can be understood
 phir chaahe wo bivi koi soshlite yaa phir model hi kyon naa ho? dilli main ek model bivi ke model shuhar ne jab aisa hi kuch kiya, to bivi ke raudra rup ke saamne shuhar kii sari kii sari modelling dhari rah gai
 But before we narrate the story of this misfortune of this husband to you, let us first make you aware of the important characters of this story i
e
 both the husband and wife
 pitane vaale shaks kaa naam he arjuna es khan jabaki is par kahar ban kar tuuti ladki kaa naam he salina vali
 Arjun and Salina are both models of Afghan origin and it is modeling, which has given both of them husband and wife status, but now Arjun is getting the same status
 ye rishta philhal jitne ajeeb mode par he, iske is mode tak pahunchane kii kahani utani hi chaunkaanewaali
 The scale of Salina's patience was not spared like this
 arjuna ne isaki vajah pehle hi taiyaar kar di thi
 One was suspected of infidelity to the husband, and the second when the wife came to meet him, he directly showed his wife the way out
 bas phir kya tha, bivi bhi shuhar ko ghar ke baahar le ai or phir jo kuch hua, use puri duniya ne dekha
 Salina and Arjun's life was not like this before
 chakachaundh se bhari modelling kii duniya, celibritiz kaa saath pej thri partiyaan
 Many times, both of them continued to hold each other's arms on the ramp, but by moving beyond the ramp, holding each other's arms in the world of reality is now overshadowed by both
 ishk main pagal donon ne shaadi to kar lee, lekin shaadi ke turant baad hi arjuna ko ye ahsaas ho gaya ki usne ye thik nahin kiya
 If Salina is to be believed, after marriage, she gave a career advice and advised to keep the relationship hidden, but something else was going on in her heart
 pehle to salina bhi uski baton main aa gai or phir arjuna ke kahe mutabik khud ko single hi bataati raheen lekin jaldi hi use pataa chal gaya ki arjuna kii asaliyat kuch or hi he
 
 
 Rather, she is very close to not only Salina, but also many other girls
 salina ko shaq to pehle se hi tha, lekin jab use pataa chalaa ki uskaa shuhar inhen vajahon usase bahaane bana kar dilli ke dwarka ilaake main ek bachaler kii tarah rah rahaa he, to uske sabar kaa paimaana chhalak gaya lekin pehali baar jab salina yahaan pahunchi to use munh kii khaani padi
 Actually, Salina had received the news that Arjun is going to avoid her eyes and marry another, but when Salina tried to talk to him face to face, Arjun came upon her
 salina ko lautnaa padaa lekin agali dafaa salina jab lautin to puri taiyaari ke saath
 Arjun was conscious of seeing Salina's rage
 lekin salina kaa gussa saatven aasmaan par tha
 First, she shouted to the neighbors and then broke on Arjuna like a hungry lioness
 bas phir kya tha, ghar kii ladaai aam kya hui, har koi arjuna par haath saafe karne laga
 Arjuna was beaten up as he saw an opportunity
 haalanki model miyaan bivi kaa ye jhagada thane pahunch kar hi khatm hua
 On receiving the news of Dhigamushti, the police reached the spot and got Arjun admitted to the hospital for treatment, but this treatment is only now available to the doctors or Salina's complaint, the police treat Arjun afresh, it remains to be seen

 vah haal hi main apane lekh 'a letters from en indian muslim youth' kii vajah se bhi aalochana jhel chuke hai
 Twitter is a place of elite and educated people, so while writing anything here, Chetan should be more careful about choosing his metaphors
