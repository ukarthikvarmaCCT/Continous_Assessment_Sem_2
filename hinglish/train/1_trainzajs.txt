 National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has said that if Tiger Memon is not found, it is wrong to say that Yakub should be punished
 dobhaal ne kaha he ki guuruuvaar ko vah mumbai main the jab nagpur main yaqub ko faansee di gai or baad main uskaa shav mumbai laayaa gaya tha
 The day was like an event
 ek netaa ke bayaan ko lekar kisi ne unhen twit kiya tha ki "yaqub kii faansee rajya pryojit qatl tha
 "he said that according to this logic the legal step taken for protection can be seen as murder
 yah mulyon kaa virodhbhas he
 National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said in the Lalit Doshi Memorial Lecture in Mumbai that after the 9 / 11 attacks, then President George Bush said that we are in favor of independence
 lekin vah desh hit ke aade nahin aani chahie
 Therefore, to say that Tiger Memon was not found, then Jacob was hanged, is wrong
 kisi ke aparaadh ko kisi or ke aparaadh se nahin joda ja saktaa
 At the end of the program, there was a question-and-answer session with Ajit Doval
 daaud ibrahim ko abhi tak na pakade jane ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki yah sahi he ki ham shaktishaalee desh hai, lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin ki sena ek bhagode ke liye duusare desh par akraman kare
 There is a legal way for that
 ek sawaal main yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya rajya hinsa kaa istemaal kar saktaa he ? rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne do took uttar diya, desh hit main agar jaruri ho to avashya
 On the question of Mahatma Gandhi's non-violence, Ajit Doval said that he would not comment on anything of the Father of the Nation
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki kamajori dushman ko uttejit karti he, isliye khud ko samarth or shaktishaalee bananaa jaruri hota he
 Doval made it clear that safety is the first duty of the state
 suraksha kii koshish main mulyon kaa virodhbhas swaabhaavik he
 The comments upha main pakistani suraksha salaahkaar sartaaj ajij se sidhe baatcheet kar videsh mantri ke adhikaar kaa hanan karne ke sawaal par ajit dobhaal ne kaha ki jaankaree sahi nahin he
 But i will not correct it either
 upha main tay hua tha ki seemaa par golibari nahin hogi, lekin pakistan kii taraf se kii gai
 It was necessary to tell them that if the bullet fired, the answer would also be found by the bullet
 jab turant baat kii darkaar ho to koun kisase baat kar rahaa yah jaruri nahin hota
 Sushma Swaraj was not there anyway
 aise main samay main agar tatkaaleen jarurat ke hisaab se kadam uthaane kii bajaay afasarshahi tarika apanaayenge to aap us jagah par rahane laayak nahin hai, jahaan hai
 Doval has said that he was in Mumbai on Thursday when Yakub was hanged in Nagpur and his body was later brought to Mumbai
 vah din kisi event kii tarah tha
 On one leader's statement someone tweeted to him that "yakub's execution was a state-sponsored murder
 " unhone kaha ki is tark ke hisaab se suraksha ke liye uthaaya gaya kanoonee kadam hatya ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 It is the antithesis of values
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ne mumbai main lalit doshi memorial lacture main kaha ki 9 / 11 hamale ke baad tatkaaleen raashtrapati jorge bush ne kaha tha ki ham aazaadee ke pakshdhar hai 
 But that country should not come in the way of interest
 isliye yah kahana ki tiger memon nahin mila to yaqub ko faansee de di gai, galat he
 Someone's crime cannot be linked to someone else's crime
 kaarykram ke ant main ajit dobhaal se sawaal-jawaab kaa ek satr chalaa
 On the question of not holding Dawood Ibrahim yet, he said that it is true that we are a powerful country, but this does not mean that the army should attack another country for a fugitive
 uske liye kanoonee rasta he
 a question was also asked whether the state could use violence? The National Security Advisor bluntly replied, if necessary, in the interest of the country
 mahatma gandhi ke ahimsa ke sawaal par ajit dobhaal kaa kahana tha vah rashtrapita kii kisi baat par tippanee nahin karenge
 But it is so important that weakness provokes the enemy, so it is necessary to make yourself strong and powerful
 dobhaal ne saaf kiya ki rajya kaa pehla kartavya suraksha he
 The antithesis of values is natural in the pursuit of security
 tippaniyan Talking directly to the Pakistani security adviser in Ufa, Sartaj Aziz, on the question of violating the foreign minister's authority, Ajit Doval said that the information is not correct
 lekin main use sahi bhi nahin karuunga
 In Ufa, it was decided that there would be no firing on the border, but from Pakistan
 unhen yah bataanaa jaruri tha ki agar goli chalegi to jawaab bhi goli se milegaa
 When it is necessary to talk immediately, then who is talking to whom? vaise bhi sushamaa swaraj vahaan nahin thim
 In such a situation, if you adopt bureaucratic methods instead of taking steps according to the needs of the time, then you are not able to live in the place where you are

 He looks at her searching within, that lost feeling, he is not himself
 He feels it , yet denies it
 It surprises him
 Something fills him yet he feels empty too
 Staring at impending doom, he yearns to be torn again
 Yet he doesn’t make a move
 The world will end before he does
 But he is unsure , cause he is not himself
 He is falling in love again

 singh rajasthan ke barmer se loksabhaa chunaav ladanaa chaahate the, lekin party ne unhen tikat nahin diya
 He then jumped into the fray as an independent candidate and was expelled by the party last month for this action
 isi prakaar adwani se unki bhopal se chunaav ladane kii ichha ke vipareet apni paaramparik gujarat kii gandhinagar seat se chunaav ladane ko kaha gaya tha

 kedarnath main vidhi vidhaan se puja shuru karaane se pehle mandir kii saaf safai ke liye mandir samiti shuukravaar ko 10 sadasyeey nai team vahaan bhejegi jiske baad mandir kaa shuddhikaran hoga
 It is expected that the puja in the temple will start from Saturday
 uttarakhand main ai bheeshan baadh main sabase zyada nuksaan kedarnath kshetra ko hi hua he haalanki mandir surakshit he
 There is a preparation to start worship again in Kedar temple from Saturday
 pujaariyon kii baithak main tay hua he ki mandir kii safai or puja main ab der nahin kii jaaegi
 a batch of 20 priests will go to Kedarnath for this
 lekin ye tabhi hoga jab sarkaar pujaariyon ke aane-jane ke liye choper kaa intazaam karegi
 The court of Kedarnath, which cleansed the souls of sinners, now needs cleaning and consecration of verses before worship
 ishwar ke ghar ko pavitra karne ke liye nashwar lok ke dharmik dhwajadhariyon kii baithak hui he
 The group of priests says that the baba who delivers Baikuntha will now have to cross the worship process
 badrinaath or kedarnath mandir samiti ke pujaariyon kii ek lambii baithak hui he
 But there is no greater lie than the fact that those who reach the peak of spirituality are free from the hypocrisy of pride
 baabaaon kii baithak main vivaad bhi hua vishaad bhi failaa
 Some said how to worship right now
 kuch ne kaha tatkaal shuru kerani hogi or kuch ne kaha vedon ke vidhaan kaa sammaan ho
 It is now agreed that the first worship after the disaster at the Kedarnath temple on Saturday
 kedarnath ko phir se puja ke laayak banane ke liye sirf akshat, doob or doodh kii zarurat nahin he
 How strange that the platoon of priests will sit in the chopper to worship the millions of people who travel for miles in the inaccessible hills to reach Kedarnath
 hajaaron logon kii parvaah chhodkar pujaariyon ne sarkaar se apane liye choper kii maang kii he
 The Muhurta of worship is now fixed on the chopper's endowment
 is bich kedarnath samvednaa kii maut or maut ke shok kaa shahar bana hua he
 Fighting with his wilderness
 puure kedarnath main koi das foot ooncha malba jamaa he
 And buried under those debris are the torn breaths, the desolate world
 baba kedaar ke kuche main shok kii garjana ke bich jari he vishwaas kii vandana kii taiyaari
 Ganesh Godiyal, president of the badrinath-kedarnath temple committee and Srinagar MLA told Srinagar, “regular worship has not started in the temple yet
 abhi vahaan kaaphi malba jamaa he jisaki safai ke liye ham helicopter se das sadasyeey team bhej rahe hai
 The team will be led by Kedarnath executive officer Anil Sharma
 main bhi parason vahaan pahunch jaaoongaa
 'he said,' All the bodies have been removed from the temple premises
 shivlinga ret main deb foot bheetar chalaa gaya he lekin use koi haani nahin hui he
 There is debris inside the temple, which was removed to some extent by the soldiers of the temple committee and NDRF
 ab yah nai team shuukravaar ko ja rahi he
 'godiyal said,' Since many workers of the temple committee have gone missing in the floods, so we had to form a new team
 ’mandir main puja shuru hone kii media main aa rahi khabaron ke bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‘pujaariyon kii maujuudagi main vidhi vidhaan se abhi koi puja nahin hui he jo log baadh main batch gaye hai, ve shankaraji ko agarbatti, phool or belptr chadha rahe hai
 This is their faith
 ’unhone kaha, ‘safai ke baad shankaracharya or rawalji (bhimshankar ling shivacharya, kedarnath ke mukhya purohit) ke maargdarshan main shuddhikaran ke baad puja sampann hogi
 At the same time, the chief priest of the Kedarnath temple, Bagesh Linga had told that the idols running from the temple have been brought down to Ukhimath where they are usually installed in the winter months
 unhone kaha, ‘ham aam taur par thand main murtiyon neeche laate hai lekin baadh ke kaaran pehle laana padaa
 Now the worship will start there only after the purification of Kedarnath temple
 jab tak shuddhikaran nahin hoga, vahaan puja nahin ho sakati

 It remains to be seen whether Rahul Gandhi fully accepts it or not

 gujarat kii siyasat main vijay roopaani or nitin patel modi ke 'ram-lakhan' maane jate he
 Both these leaders took blessings from Keshubhai Patel, the first BJP chief minister in Gujarat on Monday, a day before the swearing-in
 haalanki 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke baad narendra modi ne bhi jaakar keshubhai patel ko mithai khilaai thi
 On the lines of Modi, political meanings are hidden behind Rupani and Nitin Patel going to Keshubhai
 bataa den ki 22 saalon main ye pehali baar he ki jab bijepi ko gujarat main 100 siton se kam mili hai
 BJP has got 99 seats out of 182 seats in the state
 bijepi ko sabase bada jhatka saurashtra kshetra main laga he
 Out of 54 seats in Saurashtra region, BJP has got 25 seats
 jabaki congress ko 29 siten mili hai
 Saurashtra is considered a fortress of the BJP
 bijepi 1995 main satta main jab pehali baar ai thi, tosaurashtra kshetra se 44 sitenzti thim
 Since then, Saurashtra has become a strong stronghold of the BJP
 saurashtra main bijepi kii jaden jamaane kaa kaam keshubhai patel ne kiya
 From 1995 to 2012, this area has been a stronghold for the BJP, but this time the Congress has been successful in penetrating this fort to a large extent
 2017 main saurashtra se bijepi kii siten ghatana party ke liye chintaa kaa sabab he
 In this way, Vijay Rupani and Nitin Patel, who are considered 'ram-lakhon' of Mendodi, have knocked at the rate of Keshubhai
 vijay roopaani saurashtra ke rajkot se hi vidhayak bane hai
 In such a situation, they are worried about the loss of seats in their area
 khaskar tab jabaki wo narendra modi ke uttaradhikari ko taur par rajya ke mukhyamantri ke singhaasana par dobaaraa virajman hone ja rahe hai
 At the same time, Nitin Patel will again take over the command of Deputy CM
 bijepi keshubhai patel ke jariye saurashtra main khiske janaadhar ko waapas laane kii jugat main he
 The meeting of both the leaders with Keshubhai is being done in this sense
 vaise vijay roopaani ne apane namakan se pehle bhi keshubhai patel ke paas jaakar unka aashirwad liya tha
 Now after returning to power, he has knocked in his court again
 iske peeche sidhe taur par saurashtra ke bigade siyaasi sameekaran ko sudhaarney kii manshaa dekhi ja rahi he
 Because after 18 months Lok Sabha elections are held
 aise main ye kadam patelon kii naaraazgi dur karne kii disha main bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 In Gujarat, even today Keshubhai Patel is considered the Bhishma Pitamah of his community
 ye alag baat he ki unki raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko samaaj kaa utana saport nahin mila 
 The entire matter has been discussed throughout the country, including Bollywood, after Bollywood's senior actor Nana Patekar was accused of molestation and molestation during the shooting
 tanushri ne 10 saal puraane ek maamle kaa zikr karte hue aarope lagaaya tha, "naanaa patekar jabaran kareeb aana chaahate the, ve shooting ke dauraan gane kaa hissaa nahin the, baavjood unhone unke saath intimet hone kii koshish kii
 "nana has reacted for the first time on the serious allegations against her
 unhone aaropon se inkaar karte hue kaha, "unka sexual haraasament se kya matlab he? vahaan par 50 se 100 log set par mere saath the
 i see what i can do legally
 " naanaa ne yah baat ek channel se marathi main kahin
 tanushree-nana controversy: Bollywood silent, journalist claims- Actress speaking truth, Salman Khan also reacted to the allegations Manthanushree had on Nana Patekar on the set
 unhone kaha, "mujhe is maamle kii jaankaree nahin he
 Let me know and understand what has happened
 ham dekhenge ki kya ho rahaa he
 At this time i really don't know what you are talking about
 "tanushri ne kaha ki aise maamalon main kisi kii image par nahin janaa chahie
 Someone can be a good actor outside, but it cannot be judged personally how the character is
 gurmeet ramarhim or tamaam baabaaon kii bhi puja hoti thi, ve bhagwaan maane jate the, lekin dekhie baad main kya asaliyat saamne ai
 Tanushree wanted to get her hair shaved, then caught the path of spirituality after choreographer Ganesh Acharya has come to the rescue of Nana Patekar after accusing Nana Patekar
 ve us film kaa hissaa the, jiskaa zikr tanushri ne kiya he
 Now the actress said on Acharya's statement that he is a liar and a mongrel
 acharya ko meri hi badaulat film main kaam mila tha
 Please tell that Acharya denied Tanushree that it was a solo song and Nana wanted to force it
 acharya ne kaha ki ye shuru se hi dual song tha
 Nana was a part of it
 unhone kaha tanushri galat bol rahi hai ki unke kaaran unhen film main kaam mila
 He said, Nana is a sweet person
 ve aisa nahin kar sakate
 Tanushree said- Ganesh Acharya is a liar and a prankster, i made him work
 Thatanushree said on Acharya's statement, "he is a liar and a man who talks about two things
 unhen meri badaulat kaam mila tha
 They had decided to take me out, so obviously they would support Nana
 ve bhi isamen baraabar shaamil hai"

 Despite reaching the pinnacle of power, the BJP has been seen lagging behind on many fronts
 1
 Decline in seats: The BJP fought the 2012 assembly elections in Gujarat under the leadership of the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 party ko kul 115 siten mili thim
 This time Narendra Modi is the PM, due to which the entire saffron brigade including BJP President Amit Shah and CM Vijay Rupani were claiming to win more than 150 seats
 lekin somvaar ko aae nattejey jhatka sabit hue
 The BJP was also unable to retain its old numbers and lost 16 seats
 2
 BJPBJP has been ruling Gujarat for 22 years for the first time since a century
 aviral vijayi kaa ye pravaah 1995 ke vidhansabha chunaav se aarambh hua or bijepi ko 121 siten milin
 After this, the party continued its superior performance in the 1998 election and won 117 seats this time
 iske baad 2002 main 127, 2007 main 117 or 2012 main 115 siton par bijepi ne paracham laharaya
 But in 2017 she fell victim to 'nervous 90' and was reduced to 99 seats
 3
 Decline in vote percentage: BJP has reduced its seats in the current elections, but its vote percentage is 1 as compared to the previous assembly elections
 25% kaa ijapha hua he
 On the other hand, if we compare this election with the Lok Sabha elections held in the midst of Modi wave in 2014, then the picture looks opposite
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 59 fisadi vot mila tha, jabaki is baar vidhansabha chunaav main party ko 49 fisadi vot mila
 That means a loss of 10 percent
 jabaki congress kii baat kii jaae use 2014 aam chunaav main gujarat kii janata se 32
 9% of the votes were secured
 jabaki 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main use 41
 The Congress has got 4 percent votes, which means that the Congress has gained about 10 percent
 duusari taraf 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav se tulana kii jaae to congress ko isamen bhi bijepi se zyada phayda hua he
 The vote share of the Congress has increased from 39 percent to 42 compared to 2012, while the BJP could get only 1 percent
 4
 Ministers lost: Many ministers of Gujarat government have also failed to save their seats in this election and have suffered defeat
 inamen banaaskantha kii vaav seat se shankar choudhary haar gaye, jo swasthya mantri the
 Atmaram Parmar had to face defeat from Botha Gadda seat, he was the social justice minister of Gujarat government

 Now BJP leader Sadhvi Prachi has said that she had asked to have four children, not 35-40 puppies
 praachi ne ravivaar ko vishwa hindu parishad ke sammelan main ye baat kahi
 Without naming any particular community, Prachi said, 'these people who produce 35-40 puppies, then spread love jihad
 us par koi baat nahin karata he
 But there was so much chaos after my statement
 logon ne mujhase kaha ki zyada bachche paidaa karne se vikaas ruk jayega par main apane bayaan par kaayam rahi

 Prachi called Shivpal Singh Yadav crazy from the stage and said that Shivpal should be sent to the asylum
 praachi ne kaha ki main ajam khan or toufeeq raja ko ghar vaapasi ke liye nimantran detii hum, inke liye hinduon ke daravaaje khule hai
 Prachi's disgrace did not stop here from where Gandhi brought the third cheek to the stage

 In the name of getting a job, the fraud was done in a few days, about twenty five million rupees, the Delhi Police arrested a man who promised to get a job by claiming himself as an IAS officer and cheated a large amount of money from them
 police ne bataaya ki naukari dilaane ke naam par aaropee ne kuch dinon main hi kareeb paune do karod rupye thage the
 Police is currently trying to find out how many people have been cheated by the accused so far
 police ke mutabik javed dilli ke jawahar laal uniwarsity se bie kar chukaa he
 After this Javed Akhtar also prepared for civil services for a few days but he could not get success
 jiske baad aaropee ne logon ko thagne kaa dhandha shuru kar diya
 According to the police, the name of Thugsir is Javed Akhtar
 aaropee logon se kahata tha ki wo ek iees adhikari he
 Wherever the accused used to go, he used to tell his cadre of another state and then after that he used to talk in such a way that no one ever suspected him
 yahi nahin wo apni oonchi pahunch bataakar logon ke naukari dilaane kaa vaada karata tha
 After this, if someone got stuck in his talk, then he used to demand money from him
 police ke mutabik abhi tak unhen pataa laga ki kuch dinon main hi javed ne kareeb paune do karod rupye logon se naukari dilaane ke naam par liye hai
 There are also two cases registered on the accused in Jammu, according to the information, two cases against Javed are registered in Jammu
 iske alaava dilli main bhi kai shikaayatein or cese javed ke khilaaf darj hai
 Not only this, there are many cases registered against Javed in Aligarh too

 It has been more than four decades since this dialogue came out of Dharmendra's mouth, but even today it remains the most memorable dialogue of Hindi cinema
 sochie, dharmendra ko agar kendriya film pramann board (sibiefasi) ke adhyaksh pehlaaj nihlani ke raaj main aaj yah samvaad bolnaa hota to isaki surat kisi hoti
 It would have been something like this, beep
 
 
 beep
 
 
 i will drink your blood yaa phir kuch or behatar aisa hota, andhaa kahin kaa, main tera khun pi jaaoongaa
 Filmmaker Shantanu Rai had a similar experience when he went to get a certificate from the censor board for his adult comedy film Guddu Ki Gun
 ve kehete hai, “jaise lekhak apane paas sounding board rakhte hai, usee tarah hamen ab apane kamare main nihlani kii photo lagaani padegi jisamen ve neeche dekhte hue kah rahe hon, “ye mat likhie

 ”duniya ke sabase bade film udyog or sibiefasi kaa rishta ateet main bhi katutapurna rahaa he
 You can think of it as a relationship between a child and a parent in which the rigid father rules for his child while the child feels that these rules are outdated and his father should change himself over time
 aaj film industry ke saamne is aditol pita kii bhoomika main 65 varshiya film produsar nihlani hai jinhone govinda abhinit sholaa or shabnam tathaa ankhen jaisi hit filmein di hai to dil tera divaana or bhai-bhai jaisi kralop bhi banaai hai
 Nihalani is currently seen circling between Bharat Bhavan, the headquarters of CBFC in Mumbai and his private office in Khar where pictures of deities are adorned on his table instead of posters of films
 is maanad pad ko nihlani itani gambhirtha se le rahe hai ki aksar ve chuttee ke din bhi kaam karte dekhe ja sakate hai
 One member of the board, who has complained about his dictator-like style, says, "they think they are the custodians of India's culture and ethics
" ” jahaan tak nihlani kii baat he, sambhawatah ve khud ko ek superhiro ke taur par dekhte honge or spiderman kii tarah is baat main yakeen rakhte honge ki “badi takat ke saath badi jimmedaariyaan bhi nibhaani padati hai
 "the only difference is that what they consider responsible, the rest of the filmmakers consider it oppressive and restrictive
 janvari main is pad par unki niyukti ke baad se aisa lagata he ki sibiefasi apane darshakon par kuch mulya thope rahaa he
 In terms of what is acceptable and what is not, the board is often taking decisions that are peculiar
 certification board kii bajaae vah kahin zyada sanskari board kii bhoomika main aa chukaa he jo apane hi banaae svachh bharat abhiyaan par niklaa hua he
 Nihalani has not been there even for a year, but his list of prey has become much longer and continues to grow
 mastijade jaisi 500 cat ke baad manjuuri paane vaali film ke diarector milaap jhaveri koi tippanee karne se bachate hai or jawaab main sirf “chibers” likhakar bhej dete hai
 The truth is that the mood of producers, directors and distributors is not as pleasant, even if some of these people are avoiding sharing their experiences
 inamen se kuch ko is baat par hairat thi ki unhen aise board kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he jo maanata he ki chumban ke drishy ko mahaj 20 second kam karke (jaisaa haal hi main james bond kii film spector ke saath kiya gaya) darshakon kii raksha kii ja sakati he
 Looking at the atmosphere of the entire country, some people may say that Nihalani and his board are doing their work & that is taking intolerance
 film aurangzeb ke diarector atul sabharwal ko unke vruttchitr in der shoej se ek drishy kaatane ko kaha gaya tha jisamen bachche ko agra kii ledar factory main kaam karata dikhaaya gaya tha
 If truth is bitter, shall we shut our eyes to it? Sabharwal asks, "what will happen next?" Will they also prohibit scenes showing garbage due to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan? ”bollywood's new Donamir Khan on 23 November in Delhi highlighted the concerns of the film industry as if," Any of my films censorship i have not had any personal experience for a long time
 jahaan tak main samajhataa hum, pichley chah se aath maheenon ke bich board kuch zyada aakraamak hua he jo mere kchayaal se chintajanak he
 "khan is lucky because if Nihalani had a term, his film Delhi Bailey would not have reached the cinema hall without many cuts and beeps
" aaj kii taarikh main haraami, saalaa or pornographer jaise shabd pratibandhit kar die gaye hai
 Kajaria's director Madhurita Anand thanks her cast that their film released on December 4 passed the board only last year
 ve is baat se waakif hai ki haryana main kanya bhrunahatya par kendrit unki yah film agar maujuuda board ke saamne jaati to unke liye dikkat paidaa ho sakati thi
 Nihalani's extreme attitude proves that censorship has become a primitive thing in itself
 filmkaar or sibiefasi ke purv sadsy amit khanna kehete hai, “saundarya ko lekar unke paas koi najariya nahin he, jo kisi bhi pramann niti kaa mul bindu hota he
 "when Nihalani came to his post in March, just three months later, many filmmakers had met the Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, to convey their concerns
 taanaashaahee ravaie, pramann main manmarjee or pratibandhit shabdon kii suchi taiyaar karne kaa aarope jhel rahe nihlani par isse koi fark nahin padataa
 He says, "I am working according to the guidelines of CBFC and till these guidelines change, i will keep working like this
 ” maujuuda board kii kaaryastylee par uth rahe sawaalon ke maddenjar rathod ko haal hi main goa main yojit bharat ke antarrashtriya film mahotsav main film industry ko aashwast karte hue kahana padaa tha, “sibiefasi kii mukhya bhoomika praaanpatr dene kii he, sensorship kii nahin
 "time is calling for reform
 This has been often said during the last 64 years, but the institutions have ignored it
" sibiefasi ek niamak sanstha he jiskaa kaam filmon ko you, you / e, e or kuch durlabh sthitiyon main es (special) reating dena he jo film ke contant par nirbhar karti he
 Defending Nihalani, a member of the advisory panel says that they are following the guidelines only in which there is no relaxation of abuses
 pramanit karne kii prakriya ke dauraan board ke sadasyon ko aise drishyon kii pahchaan kerani hoti he jo mahilaon kaa apmaan karte hon, hinsa, barbarta or aatank ke drishyon se bachanaa hota he tathaa aise drishyon ko pahchaanana hota he jo desh ke liye khatra ho sakate hai
 The problem arises from the fact that the last guidelines for certification of films under the Cinematograph Act, 1952 were issued in 1991
 board kii sadsy or samajashastri nandini saradesai kahati hai, “ye disha-nirdesh na sirf apraasangik hai balki phaltu bhi hai
 The world has changed dramatically in the last 25 years
 ” goa main rathod ne kaha tha, “ham nae cinemetograph kanoon par kaam kar rahe hai
 a draft amendment to this law has come from the Justice Mudgal Committee
 ham ise saarvajanik daayre main rakh denge yaa phir suzav ke liye visheshgyon ko saunp denge
 Kabir Khan, director of Ek Tha Tiger and Bajrangi Bhaijaan, says, "the ideal situation is for the audience to come to the theater and decide what they want to see
 ” ham adarsh sthiti se kaaphi dur hai, isliye khan or madhur bhandarkar samet kai filmkaaron kaa maananaa he ki hamaare paas niamak sanstha honi hi chahie
 Bhandarkar has had an old quarrel with the board since his films Fashion, Heroine and Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji received the SHA certificate
 ve kehete hai, “paimaane kii jarurat hoti he or ek nunatam anushaasan banaae rakhana chahie, par filmkaar kii manshaa or uskaa sandarbh bhi dekhnaa chahie
 One of the guidelines of CBFC is also that "artistic expression and creative freedom should not be unduly obstructed
" ” bhandarkar maanate hai ki maujuuda maahaul main filmkaaron ko khud se hi apane upar bandishen laga leni chahie
 He says, "we are living in such a delicate time where people get hurt very easily
 phir kaha jaataa he ki ham khud par bandish nahin lagaate
 i am so desperate that i am thinking, start making cartoon films
 ” diarector ke upar produsar kaa bhi atirikt dabaav hota he jise you yaa you / e certificate hi chahie kyonki satellite ke adhikaar daanv par lage hote hai
 a film with an "A" rating has to get a certificate again before it is shown on TV, which means that it may get more cuts
 iskaa misaal grand masti he jo bade parade par 135 minute kii thi jabaki chote parade par uski avadhi mahaj 98 minute rah gai he
 Says Bhandarkar, "there is no alternative but to accept this decision
 ”saarvajanik hota aakroshaboard ke ek sadsy kehete hai, “sibiefasi main kuch gadabad jarur he
 Nihalani continues to intervene, remove hair and violate his jurisdiction
 ” paaya gaya he ki ve film ke pradarshan ke dauraan riviging cameti ke saath baithte hai jabaki yah unka kaam nahin he chunki is kaam ke liye board sadasyon kii sankchaya paryaapt he
 Board members say, "there remains an indirect pressure
 unke kamare main rahete hue aakhir board ke sadsy bolne kii hikvamat kaise kar sakate hai?”board ke kuch sadsy nihlani ke taanaashaahee bhare ravaie se itane pareshaan hai ki ve apana gussa saarvajanik manchon par nikaal chuke hai
 Ashok Pandit attacked Nihalani's style of work on Twitter and the inner discontent came out like this
 aam taur se dakshinpanthiyon kii qatari main khadey hone vaale pandit kehete hai, “aazaadee honi chahie
 Not every man will make Ramayana or Mahabharata
 main jab se sadsy bana hum, sirf ek yaa do short filmon ke certificate kaa kaam mujhe diya gaya he
 He has taken all the work in his hands alone
 ”ritred iees or soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ke purv sachiv raghu menon jaise sadsy sibiefasi ke saath do dashak se jude rahe hai
 Now they are sidelined
 board ke sadasyon, nihlani or siio anuraag shrivastav ko november main likhe mail main unhone kaha tha ki nihalaani ke raaj main board ke sadasyon ke saath jaisaa “laaparvaah or betkalluf” bartaav ho rahaa he, ve usase aahat hai
 He writes, "I have never seen any ministry's insensitivity and disregard for an important autonomous institution that has been set up under a law passed by Parliament
 
 
 agar yah board itnaa hi apraasangik he to ise bhang kar diya janaa chahie
 "it is no wonder that Nihalani prefers only those members who say yes to him
" baaki ko darkinar kar diya gaya he
 Filmmaker Chandraprakash Dwivedi also joined the list of disagreeable people in March when he wrote this letter, "I am now feeling uneasy while being part of a prestigious institution where the collective decision or collective tone of the board is not heard
" ” kabhi ek peedi ke filmkaaron kii pehali pasand rahe juhu sthit mashhoor hotel san ain sand main board kii july main hui baithak main kaha gaya ki apshabdon vaali kukhyat suchi ko waapas liya ja rahaa he
 Many filmmakers say that regional offices are still using this list in the process of certification
 ek filmkaar kehete hai, “hamase kaha gaya ki media kii report par mat jaaen
 It is still in force
 ”usee baithak main nihlani ne saradesai ko sharmila tagore or lila samson ke kaarykaal main unke kaam kii vajah “khule vichaaron vaali” ghoshit kar diya
 In September, Sardesai met IAS officer and CEO Anurag Shrivastava in Mumbai and asked him to call a board meeting where all complaints could be heard and important policy decisions could be discussed
 ab tak aisi koi bhi baithak nahin bulaai gai he
 The board of CBFC is scheduled to have four meetings in a year
 janvari main pad par pehla varsh puraa kar rahe nihlani ke raaj main sirf do baithken hui hai
 Sardesai says, "dissatisfaction is widespread but no one is interested in it
 ”sibiefasi raajnneeti se juda sanstha nahin he
 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting appoints members of CBFC for a term of three years and members of the Consultative Panel in nine regional offices for two years
 aksar nirapavaad rup se aise hi sadasyon ko chunaa jaataa he jo sattadhari dal ke virdohi na hon, bhale hi uske puure samarthak na bhi hon
 There may be truth in the fact that Nihalani has got this post for "har Har Modi" but then Nihalani's supporters can say that Leela Samson got this position because she was Priyanka Gandhi's Bharatanatyam teacher
 anupam kher ko bijepi kaa vafaadaar mana jaataa he
 He was removed as soon as the first UPA government came

 Nowadays, the boldness in films has increased, where does your film stay? My effort is to make a film that the whole family can sit and watch
 kisi bhi insaan ko film dekhne par bura na lage
 It is said that Deol family films are a hit on single screens? Not so
 meri single yaa multiplexes ko lekar koi soch nahin hai

 So there is a lot of discussion now that when Hrithik tweeted the tweet on January 28, why not notice was taken even after so many months, why the notice was already issued
 kahin yah daanv bhi kangana kii ore se to nahin? The Congress has released an audio clip of Janardhana Reddy, an accused in the illegal mining of iron ore, in the midst of a fierce battle for government formation in Karnataka, in which he can be heard luring a Congress MLA to join the BJP

 mashkkat ke baad congress ne karnataka kaa masalaa sulajhaa bhi liya to centre kii musiibat kaa nibatara bhi karnaa hoga
 There are reports that after being elected the CM in Karnataka, the Railway Minister and the Law Minister caught in the coal scandal may fall foul
 karnataka kii janata ke darbar main jeet kaa jashn manaae congress yaa asli or desh kii sarvocch adaalat se mili fatkaar par aansu bahaae
 Call it irony or the fate of the Congress, the day the Congress was gifted with a spectacular victory in the Karnataka elections, on the same day, the government was severely reprimanded by the Supreme Court on the act of the Law Minister, soaking the coal scam of 1 lakh 86 thousand crores
 After the cbi's affidavit blackened the Manmohan government
 ab dekhie congress kii kismat kaa nayaa pher jaise hi congress karnataka ko nayaa mukhyamantri dene main kaamyaab hogi, usee ke baad mahanmohan sarkaar ke do mantriyon kii chuttee kii ulti ginati shuru ho jaaegi
 If sources are to be believed, Railway Minister Pawan Bansal, who was caught in the bribery scandal, is sure to leave
 koyala ghotaale kii sibiai report badalawaane ke iljaam main fanse kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar kii bhi chuttee ho sakati he yaa unka mantralay badla ja saktaa he
 This is the trouble of the Congress government at the center

 People gave absolute majority but with this the race for the post of Chief Minister has also started in Congress
 siem kii res main ek do nahin puure paanch naam saamne aa rahe hai
 The name of Mallikarjun Kharge is at the forefront of this
 71 saal ke khadge dalit netaa hai or centre main shram mantri hai
 Being a Scheduled Caste, Kharge may get a chance to assume the chair of Karnataka

 In 2006, he joined the Congress and then did not look back
 lekin dikkat ye he ki ab tak siddharmaiya ko bahari hi mana jaataa he
 The fifth claimant is considered to be God
 62 saal ke dalit netaa karnataka congress ke adhyaksh rahe hai
 But his biggest difficulty is that he had to lose his seat even in the midst of a spectacular victory by the Congress
 mukhyamantri ke paanch daavedaaron main khaas baat ye he, ki ye sabhi obisi yaa dalit tabake se taalluk rakhte hai
 According to sources, the chair of Karnataka is going to be given to any one of these five

 But if his son and Samajwadi Party face Akhilesh Yadav remains absent in this ceremony, then the entire party is bound to suffer

 In 2000, he left both the party and the Sangh
 bahut saare log maanate hai ki unhone atal bihari vaajapeyi ko aresas kaa mukhauta bataaya tha jiske baad donon ke bich sambandhon main khatas aa gai thi or akhirkaar unhen party chhodani padi

 He never had power at all costs

 Look at the BJP-RSS relationship, the Sangh never needs any political crutch
