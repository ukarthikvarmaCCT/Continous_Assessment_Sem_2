 These contestants are none other than Zubair Khan
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki salmaan ne sho main deshbhar ke saamne unhen kutta kaha
 He apologized
 iske baad salmaan ne apane andaaj main maafee bhi maangi
 Apologizing, he had said, "last week i used the word dog
 isliye main duniyabar ke sabhi kutton se maafee maangana chahta hum ki maine is shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Dogs are very loyal
 ve puri tarah apane maalik kaa saath dete hai
 'zubair said - Salman goes with whom and what heroine is all reported', in fact, Salman said in the last episode, taking the class of Jubair Khanki, 'if you don't make me a dog, then my name is not Salman Khan'
 ghar se baahar aate hi jubair ne naa sirf salmaan khan ke khilaaf dhaava bolaa balki kuch intervyuuj main kaha, salmaan sho par unke saath is tarah pesh aae wo maafee maange
 Why did Salman apologize to all the dogs in the world? To whom? What did Zubair say about Salman? Zubair said in an interview to Indian Express after Salman's apology, "I would like to thank Salman that he apologized to his brothers (dogs) on the show
" jubair ne kaha- main allaah kaa shukraguzaar hum ki salmaan khan ne apane bhaaiyon jo ki kute hai, unase sho main maafee maangi he
 "zubair also said," Bigg Bossmakers and Colors channel have stopped receiving their phone calls
 channel ne tiarapy ke liye sho main meri galat pahchaan bataai or mujhe don daaud kaa damaad bhi bataaya
 When my lawyer asked for my manifesto from the channel, he said that he was lost
 isse saaf pataa chalata he ki ye sab unhone tiarapy bantorne ke liye kiya he
 'well now it is to see what this time Salman's attack on Zubair is because this time not only Salman but also Salman's brothers have dragged Zubair into this dispute

 bihar main 19 june ko hone vaala rajyasabha chunaav kisi thriller drame se kam nahin
 With the support of the BJP, Sabir Ali and Anil Sharma will be able to beat the JDU candidates or prove their kingship once again after the defeat of former CM Nitish Kumar in the Lok Sabha elections with the support of their arch rival Lalu Yadav
 It will be clear only after counting of votes
 is bich siyasat tej he, jod-tod kii raajnneeti joro par he or aise main nattejey bahut had tak jithan ram maanjhi kii sarkaar kaa bhavishya bhi tay karenge
 Lalu said, Nitish you go ahead, we call with you, Nitish called for support for his candidates, first Lalu first launched a political attack, then by calling for a meeting of the Legislature Party, he suspended suspense on the strategy ahead
 mangalvaar ko vidhayak dal kii baithak hui, 21 main se 4 emele nadaarad rahe
 This was followed by another meeting
 argedy supremeo ne faisla kiya ki bijepi kii raajnneeti ko maat dena jaruri he isliye unki party ke vidhayak nitish ke ummidavaaron kaa samarthan karenge
 Lalu gave support while Nitish said
 
 
 thankuargedy kaa samarthan mila to nitish ne dhanyavad dene main deree nahin lagaai
 In a press conference convened at his home, Nitish said that the real face of the BJP has been exposed
 bijepi maanjhi sarkaar ko giraane kii yojana bana rahi thi par vah safal nahin hogi
 The BJP was openly sabotaging parties in the Rajya Sabha elections, but the plot has failed
 hamaari party lalu yadav ko unke samarthan ke liye dhanyavad detii he
 After Lalu's decision, the BJP announced that it would support the candidate of rebel mlas of JDU after the BJP came out with its opponents
 party vidhayakon ke saath hui baithak ke baad susheel modi ne bataaya ki unki party sabir ali or anil sharma ke paksh main vot daalegi
 What is the importance of this Rajya Sabha election
 The future of the current government of Bihar rests on these elections to a great extent
 darasal, mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi congress, sipiai or argedy ke bahari samarthan se vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne main kaamyaab ho sake the
 But after the expansion of the cabinet, some JDU mlas took rebellion
 virodh saarvajanik ho gaya
 Nitish Kumar came on target
 jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ke samarthak maane jane vaale in vidhayakon ne apni hi party ke rajyasabha ummidavaaron ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 First, he then fielded candidates for two seats
 jediu kii ore se gulam rasul baliyavi or purv rajdoot pawan verma ke khilaaf sabir ali tathaa real estate company amrapali group ke emdi anil sharma ne parchaa bharaa jinhen baagiyon kaa samarthan mil gaya
 However, Nitish is still hopeful that the rebels will return and win will be theirs
 agar aisa hota he to jithan ram maanjhi sarkaar ke liye aane vaale din achche hai
 But the victory of Sabir Ali or Anil Sharma will increase Nitish's problems
 khaskar yah saaf ho jayega ki ab party main hi unka wo rasookh nahin he
 Election demands will soon intensify in Bihar
 aane vaale din main kai baagi vidhayak party chhod sakate hai
 You can change the religion and caste based political equations
 The whole politics of Bihar has become centered around Muslim voters
 khaskar loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon se yah saaf ho gaya he ki agadi jati ke voter puri tarah se bijepi ke saath hai
 BJP, which was once considered a supporter of Nitish, has also managed to make a dent in the voters, but what will be the attitude of these voters in the assembly, it will decide the time to come
 yadav ab bhi lalu ke saath hai to kurmi or koiri matadaataaon ke liye nitish hi ekmaatr vikalp hai
 If polarization happens on the basis of religion, Lalu and Nitish will be marginalized in the politics of Bihar
 aise main kariban 16 fisadi muslim matadaata ahm hai
 Will Lalu and Nitish come together to defeat BJP in the assembly elections? It is too early to say anything about it and caste equations are against this friendship
 bhale hi janata dal ke jamaane main yadav or kurmi jaat kabhi ek saath hua karte the
 But a lot has changed in Bihar in the battle of supremacy
 anya pichhadaa varg main in donon jatiyon ke alaava bhi anya jatiyaan hai jinaki bhoomika ahm ho gai he
 Amidst all this, it has become clear that politics not only dominates in Lok Sabha elections but also in Rajya Sabha elections
 nitish ne jahaan ise pratishtha kaa sawaal bana diya he to bijepi chupchaap bina saamne aae shatranj kii bisaat par apane daanv khel rahi he

 Nitish said that in the current situation it is a big challenge to handle the railway and make it development-oriented again
 unhone kaha ki rail mantri pawan bansal ko puri himmat karke faisle lene honge
 He said that the railway will have to be removed from this critical situation and its pending projects will be completed on time, only then it will not get its benefit
 The cost of the projects increases, which will increase the burden on the railway and the public will not get the benefit

 Hinglaj temple in Balochistan comes to Chishtar Dargah in a very special ajmer for the reopening of khokhrapar-munabav border
 After opening of Kartarpur corridor for many Pak pilgrims, now a group of Americans asked Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan of India
 With a request to reopen the khokhrapar-munabav border
 america ke edvocacy samooh ne paak pradhanmantri se anurodh kiya he ki imran khan lakhon muslim or hindu shraddhaluon ke liye is seemaa ko phir se kholen
 With the opening of the Khokhrapar border, millions of followers of Sant Moinuddin Chishti will be able to visit the Chishti Dargah in Ajmer
 wois of karachi ne kaha ki saath hi yah rasta hindu tirthayatriyon ko pakistan ke baluchistan praant ke hinglaj mandir kii yatra karne kii bhi anumati degaa
 Advocacy group is a group of idiots representing Urdu-speaking Indian Muslims and settled in Pakistan after partition
 apni website par kahata he ki yah pakistan ke sabase bade shahar, karachi kii durdasha ke bare main vaishvik jaagarukta badhaane ke liye patibaddh he
 There will be doubt about the Kartarpur Corridor! Nadeem Nusrat of the group said in a letter written to the Prime Minister of Nepal, Imranko, 'now that your government has opened the Kartarpur Corridor by facilitating the journey of Sikh pilgrims to visit their holy places in Pakistan, which is commendable Magnificence, then i will give you millions of Muslim and Hindu followers of Saint Moinuddin Chishti and Hinglaj Devi respectively i do not request from that to open the khokhrapar-munabao border with immediate effect
 nadeem nusrat ne kaha ki aapkaa yah faisla na keval lakhon dilon ko jeet legi, balki yah donon deshon ke bich logon ke jariye tanaav ko kam karne main madad bhi karegi
 If this does not happen, then those rumors and speculations will air that the intention behind opening of Kartarpur corridor was something else
 unhone kaha ki bharat or pakistan main rahane vaale lakhon muslimon or hinduon ko 1947 se puja ke do sthanon par jane main lagaataar kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Now in the same way with which you opened the Kartarpur corridor, both these issues can be resolved as soon as possible
 chaar guna zyada lambii yatrabhaarat ke lakhon musalmaan, jopakistanke sindh praant ke shahari ilaakon main jaakar bas gaye the
 a large number of them still have a deep reverence for Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti, and want to visit Chishti's Dargah in Ajmer
 isko lekar koi vivaad bhi nahin hona chahie kyonki pakistan kaa sindh praant bharat ke rajasthan ke saath apni seemaa saajha karata he, or sindh kii khokharapaar seemaa se ajmer tak kii yatra mahaj kuch ghanton kii he
 The letter said that the route has been closed for years, forcing people to travel four times longer for pilgrimage to Ajmer via Punjab and Delhi
 yah anaavashyak lambii yatra shraddhaluon par atirikt vittiya boj bhi daalati he
 On the other hand, the Hinglaj Temple is a sacred Hindu temple on the Makran coast in Balochistan province
 har saal badi sankhya main shraddhalu hindu upaask hinglaj mandir kii chaar divasiy yatra karte hai
 In Lucknow's coordination meeting with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (ISS) and BJP organization leaders, Amit Shah said that he himself wanted Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav to jointly contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections so that the confusion of the alliance could be cleared
 haalanki soobe kii siyasat par najar rakhane vaale log is baat ko maanate hai kispa-basapaka gathbandhan bijepi ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Despite this, whether the BJP president really wants to have an alliance or is merely saying this to increase the morale of the party workers, it is not clear
 bataa den ki desh kii satta kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar gujarata he
 In the Lok Sabha 2019, the Opposition is trying to stop this path for BJP and PM Narendra Modi by forming two big satrap alliance like Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav
 uttar pradesh ke badalte raajnneetik sameekaran ke maddenjar samanvay baithak main charchaa hui
 On the political challenges emerging from the alliance of SP and BSP, many leaders expressed their concerns on behalf of BJP
 is baat par amit shah ne party netaaon se saaf kaha ki vah khud chaahate hai ki soobe main sapa-basapa jarur gathbandhan karke bijepi se chunaav lade taaki gathbandhan kii bhranti bhi dur ho sake
 BJP president Amit Shah may not seem worried about the SP-BSP alliance
 lekin vaaki agar donon dal saath milakar chunavi maidan main utarate hai to bijepi ke liye 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana mushkil ho saktaa he
 In 2014, when the SP-BSP came together, the SP and BSP contested separately in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the BJP alliance won 73 out of 80 seats
 haalanki voton ke aankade denkhe or agar 2014 main sapa-basapa milakar utarate to tasviir alag hoti
 In the Modi wave, BJP would have won 37 seats, while the SP-BSP had 41 seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 42
 30 percent votes were received
 jabaki sapa-basapa ko kul milakar 41
 80 percent votes were received
 congress ko tab 7
 5 percent votes were received
 aise main agar sapa, basapa or congress milte he ye vot 50 fisadi ke kareeb hota
 In terms of 2017, bjp's loss in terms of the number of votes polled in the 2017 UP Assembly elections, the SP-BSP got 57 seats out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP and they averaged 1
 45 lakh voton se jeet hoti
 Whereas BJP would get 23 seats in the account and they would have won by an average of 58 thousand votes lead
 varanasi, mathura, gajiabad or gautamabuddha siton ko 1 lakh se jeet milti
 The BJP is hoping that if the SP-BSP come together
 chunaav main donon partiyon ke vot ek duusare ke liye transfar nahin honge, kyonki donon partiyon ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich chhattis ke aankade rahen hai
 In such a situation, BJP can benefit
 haalanki bijepi kii is ummid par upachunaav ke nattejey pani pher rahe hai
 In the by-elections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has suffered the loss of the SP-BSP together
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or dipti siem keshav prasad maury ko apni siten gavanni padi he
 Actually, even after the defeat of BJP in the by-election, Amit Shah wants SP-BSP alliance
 iske peeche mana ja rahaa he ki pichley dinon upi main bijepi ke dwaara hue obisi ke jatigat sammelan or dalit sammelan kaa party ko phayda milegaa
 These are considered the original vote banks of the SP-BSP
 aise main ab dekhnaa hoga ki 2019 main sapa-basapa ke saath aane kaa bijepi ko phayda miltaa he yaa phir nuksaan? 'today's India' and 'future of India' took place at the India Today Mind Rocks Youth Summit 2019 in Bhubaneswar on the 10th of January
 yahaan kaling institute of industrial technology kaa sabhaagaar yuvaaon kii urja se sarabor tha
 His overwhelmed eyes were set on the celebrities of the world of entertainment, sports and politics on stage
 ve un hastiyon kii jubaani unke nijee jivan ke sangharsh or safalataa kii kahaniyon ko sun rahe the tathaa jivan main majboot or jujharu banane ke mantra bhi le rahe the
 Eminent celebrities were invited to speak at the summit
 din bhar ke rangarang kaaryakramon kii chata main sarabor kuch sitaron ke pair khud-ba-khud thirak uthe the jisase maahaul or satarangi ho gaya tha
 In the midst of all this, it emerged clearly in this event that what young India thinks today and what beliefs it believes in
 chaahe imran hashmi or taapasi pannu jaise bollywood sitare hon yaa odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak jaise rajaneta yaa bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or congress ke sadsy, sabaki maujuudagi sabhaagaar main alag hi urja pravaahit kar rahi thi
 Pannu shared talk about the break-up in their relationship and the anguish caused by being rejected in the film industry
 unhone kaha, ''girane main koi buraai nahin, lekin waapas apane pairon par khadey na hona buree baat he
 Hashmi had danced with some girls on stage and coaxed them
 unhone summit main apni nai film whi chit india ke bare main charchaa karte hue kaha ki kaise nakal sangathit aparaadh ban chuki he jo ayogy logon ko medical or ejineering kii ahm parikshaon main nakal ke jariye paas karaane main madad karti he
 However, viewers were more interested in the story of his chemistry with his first kiss, first crush and the heroine he worked with
 yahi nahin, mind rox 2019 main shaamil logon kii dilchaspee kaa dayera bollywood ke kalakaaron kii nijee kahaniyon se badhkar rajnatik muddon se sambandhit bahes main bhi vaisaa hi vyapak dikhaa
 Raj Chengappa, Group Editorial Director (publishing), India Today, rightly remarked that "india of today and tomorrow" has become interested in politics and is forming its opinion on various issues — whether financially 10% reservation for weaker general category, or potential candidates for the next Prime Minister of India
 patnayak ne students ko vot dene ke liye party kaa chunaav karne se pehle apane muddon ko praathamikta dene kii ahmiyat ke bare main bataaya
 The Chief Minister advised the younger generation who are refusing to be used in the name of populist electoral slogans and religion, "look at your priorities and then look at the party's political manifesto on whom you trust the most and only then Cast your valuable vote

 However, recently the constitutional provision relating to 10 percent reservation in general category has not shown much support
 chaatro ne samaan rojgaar muhaiyaa karaane par zyada jor diya or kalikesh ke suzav, ''desh ko 100 pratishat yogyata-aadhaarit pranali ke saath sabhi ko samaan avasar dene ke lakshya kii ore badaae kii aavashyaktaa he

 Sushmita Dev termed this 10 percent reservation initiative as a 'contingency measure' by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and described it as an exercise to compensate for the 'failure of job creation'

 rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) ke sar sanghachaalak dow
 Mohan Madhukar Bhagwat described Hindutva as the unity of Hindustan and the identity of all the people living here and said that Hindustan is the motherland of every person living in this country and the aim of the Sangh is to build a powerful nation by organizing society on the basis of Hindutva
 is
 guru poornima kii purv sandhya par aresas kii patna mahanagar ikai dwaara yojit ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue bhagwat ne kaha ki guru nanak dev ji ke samay se is samskruti ko hamaare desh kaa saamaanya naagarik hindu samskruti ke naate jaanata he or sari duniya unako hindu naam se pahachaanati he aise main hindutv apni desh kii ekta kaa aadhaar he
 He said that our country is a country that teaches unity in diversity and the culture of generations going on is the basis of this unity
 bhagwat ne kaha ki hamaare samaaj main itani bhashaaen or vividhta he, kai praant, rahan-sahan, khan-paan or reeti-rivaaj hai ki baahar se aane waalon ko lagata he ki yahaan saikadon desh ek ho gaye hai
 He said that the rest of the world thinks that unity can only happen when people are the same, so they try to mold the whole world in their own mold
 sangh pramukh ne kaha ki bharat ekmaatr aisa desh he jisane pracheen samay se hi vividhtaon main ekta ko dekha or yahi jivan kaa sarvocch, shaashvat or sukhad prapti kaa ekmaatr upaay he
 He said that when prestige and peace is not found anywhere other than this motherland in this life, then why fight, everyone has to live here
 bhagwat ne kaha ki sabaki mata bharat mata he or koi baahar se nahin aayaa kyonki swayan ko hindu na kehane vaale logon main yahudee or parsi ko chod den kisi ke purvaj baahar se nahin hai or sabhi ke purvaj samaan hai
 His DNA is one and was a Hindu ancestor
 bhagwat ne kaha ki ek mathrubhumi ke putr or samaan purvajon ke vanshaj or hindu samskruti se prabhavit ham sabhi hindu hai
 Bhagwat said that leaders or political parties can prove to be helpful only when the ideology of the society is good
 unhone kaha ki achche netaa, sarkaar, party or acchhee niti tab sahaayak sabit hoti he jab samaaj acha hota he
 The Sangh chief said that no individual or group can take credit for the progress of the country after independence, but it is a result of the gratitude of the entire society
 unhone kaha ki pichley do varshon ke dauraan khaas taur se ek varsh se desh main aise vichaar prakat hone lage hai ki ham mahashakti ke rup main khadey nahin ho paaenge or isko lekar janamanas niraash hota chalaa ja rahaa he

 The second reason was the shutdown of the Internet
 baraamula ke mushtak ahamed kehete hai, ''aam taur par meraa betaa internet ke jariye mausam par nigaah rakhata he
 But it was closed for the last three months and we could not get the weather forecast
 ''pichley 5 agast ko anuchhed 370 ke tahat vishesh darja khatm karne ke baad kii ghati main nakebandi or haal ke ugravadi hamalon tathaa hatya kii vaardaaton se fasal kataai main der hui or seb ke vyapaar main rukaawat ai

 ek pakhwaade ke bheetar prabhavit kisaanon ke paas pahunchakar sateek survey karaayaa jayega

 The Jammu and Kashmir government has invited tenders for the long-pending insurance scheme on 16 November
 javid ke mutabik, beemaa companiyaan zyada ooncha premium maang rahi thim, jisaki vajah se is yojana par amal main deree hui he

 iesas ke sargana abu bakar al bagdadi kii maut ko lekar phir ek khabar ai he
 Syria's state television has claimed that Baghdadi was killed in a June 11 airstrike in the city of Raqqa, Syria
 vaise isse pehle ki duniya bagdadi kii maut par yakeen kare, ham aapako bataa den ki pichley do saal main bagdadi kii maut kii ye saatvin khabar he
 Russia claims Baghdadi's death has once again claimed the biggest attack on Baghdadi ever
 is baar ye daawa rus kii taraf se kiya gaya he
 The Russian Army says that on May 28, it carried out an airstrike in Raqqa, the IS stronghold in Syria
 army ke mutabik, is hamale main aies ke top leader samet or bhi kai netaa maare gaye hai
 Let me tell you that a few days ago Syrian State Television had made this claim and now the Russian Army itself is claiming this
 rakka main maut kii barishdawa ye ki syria main uske garh rakka main aasmaan se hui he safed maut kii barish or is barish main maaraa gaya duniya kaa sabase khoonkhaar aatanki or iesas kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi
 This white death is the same as that which was rained by the Russian Air Force in the city of Idlib, Syria about one and a half years ago
 jab raat ke andhere main aasmaan safed raushnee se chamachama uthaa or phir naarangi aag ne puure ilaake ko apni agosh main le liya
 And when all this stopped, everything in the area was burnt down due to fire
 ab bilkul vaisaa hi hamale kaa daawa syria ke us shahar rakka main kiye jane kaa daawa hua he, jo bagdadi or iesas kaa garh he
 In an attack claiming Baghdadi meeting, the Russian Ministry of Defense has said that the action was taken by targeting the meeting of the Islamic State's Military Council in Raqqa, northern Syria
 jisamen bagdadi ke alaava 30 aies commander or 300 ladaake maujuud the
 His army has carried out air strikes near Raqqa with SU-34 and SU-35 aircraft
 ye shahar ISIS kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 In this air bombing on May 28, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was killed
 iske alaava is hamale main iesas ke kai top cmanders bhi maare gaye hai
 Photo of the attack Jarius says that he had received news that an intelligence meeting of ISIS top commanders was being held, in which Baghdadi himself was also present
 lihaaza roosi vimaanon ne apni bambaari main isi baithak ko nishaanaa banaaya
 In which Baghdadi died
 roosi sena kii taraf se is bambaari kii ek tasviir bhi jari kii gai he
 After the news of the Syrian state TV channel, confirming this news from the Russian military is considered a reliable source
 chunki ye khabar rus ke raksha mantralay ke hawaale se ai he
 In this case, the chances of getting it right are very high
 syria tivi ne kii bagdadi ke maare jane kii pushtiisse pehle syria ke state televijan kar chuki he ki rakka shahar main syria or koelation phujon kii safed phosforus bombing main iesas kaa mukhiya abu bakar al bagdadi maaraa gaya he
 According to the news published in a big foreign newspaper and the footage of the attack released on the Internet, the coalition forces launched a massive attack on terrorist targets in Raqqa, Syria
 footage main saafe zaahir he ki sena ne rakka ke ek khaas ilaake main maujuud building ko nishaanaa banaakar safed phosforus bam se hamalaa kiya
 It is believed that the area targeted was not only a stockpile of ISIS weapons but also the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi was also present
 phosforus hamale main aatank kaa aakaa dherrusi raksha mantralay ke daavon se ek kadam aage syria ke state televijan kaa daawa he ki is phosforus hamale main duniya kaa ye sabase khoonkhaar aatanki maaraa gaya he
 However, there has been no such confirmation from ISIS
 lekin aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki internet par hamale se judi footage khud sanghathan se taalluk rakhane vaali news agency amaak ne jari kii hai
 At the same time, intelligence agencies have also claimed that it is true that the leader of the terrorist group Baghdadi has fled from Mausul towards his self-proclaimed capital Raqqa in Syria
 or isi daawey kii vajah se syria sena ke adhikari soshal media par bagdadi kii maut kii pushti karne se peeche nahin hat rahe hai
 Baghdadi's successor, also Majak Ab Kaboudi, an officer of the Halakasiriya army, declared that Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was killed
 isi tarah se sirian state television ke kalid razzaq ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki syria ke rakka shahar main hue hawaii hamale main aatanki abu bakar al bagdadi maaraa gaya
 The news of Baghdadi's death has come at this time
 jab uske uttaradhikari bataae ja rahe ayaad al jumali ko syria-iraq seemaa par hawaii hamale main maar giraaya gaya he
 Jumali was the second largest leader and minister of war of ISIS
 kai agenciyon ne kii khabar kii pushtibhale kisi badi agency ne bagdadi kii maut kii pushti na kii ho magar roosi raksha mantralay or sirian state television ke alaava sirian activist, rakka sahit kai or media is khabar kii pushti kar rahe hai
 However, the uk-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has acknowledged that coalition forces have carried out airstrikes on Raqqa in which 13 civilians have been reported dead
 ye pehali baar nahin he, jab bagdadi kii maut kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Even before this, such claims have been made many times
 magar har baar 25 million dollar kaa ye inami khoonkhaar aatanki mar kar bhi zindaa ho jaataa he
 The news of Baghdadi's death has come 6 times, many agencies are accepting the talk of coalition army air strike in the city
 is hamale main kai logon ke maare jane kii bhi pushti kar rahi hai
 But the rest of the country, including the US, are avoiding any claim at all about the death of Baghdadi
 isaki ek vajah ye bhi he ki ye syrian sena kaa propeganda bhi ho saktaa he taaki sena kaa hausala badhaayaa ja sake
 And the second reason for not confirming the death of Baghdadi is that even before this the news of his death has been reported six times
 rakka main gathbandhan sena ke phosforus hamale main bagdadi ke maare jane kii sirian state television kii khabar sukun dene vaali zarur he
 But this news is true, it cannot be believed so easily

 There is no fixed way to conserve water
 In different parts, different methods may be adopted but the aim is same- to conserve every drop of water

 Question- Sadhvi Pragya is not yet freed from the allegations of Terror, do you think her right to be a candidate? Answer- See, as far as i know, Sadhvi Pragya is not a convict, not a convict who is not convicted, she can contest elections
 Yes, he has the right to say what i can

 Question- How do you see a victory for yourself this time? Answer - As far as our victory or margin of victory is concerned, it is for the people of Lucknow to decide, on this i cannot say what our victory will be
 
 lekin itnaa kah saktaa hum kii lakhanu kii janata kaa adbhut sneh mujhe mil rahaa he, or vah mujhe milegaa
 Question- The tickets of your senior and elderly leaders have been cut, do not you think that their displeasure may be too heavy for the party? Answer- Advani ji, Joshi ji is not angry, both of these are our senior leaders

 seat belt or air bag vaahan chaalak or yatriyon kii suraksha main sabase adhik mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 The study found that those who have young children try to drive in a 'civilized' way on the roads, while they gradually become careless as the child grows up
 haalanki jab bachche kii umr kishoravastha kii hoti he to ve apane bachche kaa role model banane ke liye adhik 'sabhy' tareeke se gaadi chalaanaa shuru kar dete hai
 The survey found that Indian women drive in a more 'civilized' way than men

 At the same time, the 'walks' attitude was found in 22 per cent of the participants, who break red lights in the absence of traffic police, wrongly overtake, walk in the wrong lane or drive at high speeds
 ford ke adhyayan main paaya gaya ki miliniells (18 se 34 saal ke log) anya kii tulana main adhik 'sabhy' tareeke se vaahan chalaate hai
 40 per cent of the participants said that they do not stop / slow down the car to help the blind or to cross the road, while 5 to 2 people said that even if they see someone on the road, they need help
 They will not help by stopping the car
 ford ke surveykshan main 41 fisadi logon kaa kahana tha ki ve sadak durghatana ke shikaar logon ko aspataal pahunchane main madad nahin karenge, jabaki 40 fisadi ne kaha ki kisi bujurg ko sadak paar karne ke liye ve apni gaadi dhimi nahin karenge

 The presence of the Taliban is not in India
 Recently Lt General Jaiswal, who has held the post of 'GOC in C' of Northern Command, told reporters in Udhampur, 66 km from Jammu, that as far as the Taliban are concerned, they are very much involved in Pakistan and The administration is handling them there
 unhone kaha, ‘‘taliban pakistan main sakriy he or is tarah kaa sanket detii koi report nahin he ki jammu-kashmir main unki maujuudagi he
 Jaiswal said that along the Line of Control, the army is ready to deal with any kind of threat from any terrorist organization
 bharat-china ke bich kuch matbhed vaale kshetra hanvastavik niyantran rekha kii sthiti ke bare main unhone kaha ki donon ore shanti or sauhaard bana hua he tathaa sahmati vaale seemaa prabandhan ke tahat donon paksh unki samaj vaali rekhaon par gasht kar rahe hai

 Lt Gen Jaiswal said that increasing the defense capability and preparing to deal with any situation is a continuous process

 jaisawaal ne kaha, ‘‘pichley saal ke mukaable is varsh is tarah ke ulanghan kahin kam hue hai
 On another question as to where in Pakistan and China there is more danger, he said, "if there is a contingency from any side then we are ready to face it

 He said that in schools, students should be "taught about the human body, its structure and parts, which are already being taught through the science subject

 The devotees were enraged and gathered in the yard outside the temple

 After Harivarshanam, the police asked the people to go out but most people opposed it
 ' dhara 144 yaa nishedhagna ke tahat ek jagah par chaar se zyada logon ke jutane par pabandi hoti he
 The SP said that the police never forbade the devotees to worship at the temple
 espi pratish kumaar ne kaha, 'jinhen neobhishekam (bhagwaan ayappa kaa ghi se abhishek) karnaa he, ve sabarimala main ruk sakate hai
 Devotees can also worship

 The trajectory of Virat Kohli's career ODI runs in this graphic (built by @usmaanalii) illustrate how fast he is scoring relative to other 10,000 run players
 If he scores at his current rate he will pass Sachin Tendulkar's runs in 79 fewer innings than it took Tendulkar

 piem modi ke intervyuu kii khaas baaten
 
 
 1
 videsh niti par piem modi ne kaha, pichley 30 saalon tak hamaare desh main asthir sarkarein rahi hai
 The people of the country gave us a majority, its effect is on the world view
 2
 The world wants to know the head of the country
 lekin modi ko koi nahin jaanata tha
 So i had to be pro-active as PM
 3
 The world is no longer bipolar, today the world is connected and all countries are dependent on each other
 4
 There was a time when we used to sit on the seashore and count the waves, but now the time has come to take the helm and get down and decide the direction and speed
 5
 On the issue of China, PM Modi said, this is the first time we are talking eye to eye
 china ke saath bharat kii kai samasyaayein chal rahi hai
 Ideological differences between the two countries are natural
 6
 There are many forces operating in Pakistan
 hamaari vahaan kii sarkaar se baatcheet jari he
 We want friendship but will not compromise on our interests
 7
 In the case of Pakistan, we have to be alert every moment
 meraa lahore janaa, paak piem ko bharat bulaanaa
 
 
 
 hamaari is bhoomika ko duniya saraah rahi he
 we want peace

 aatankwaad ke mudde par pakistan ko jawaab dene main dikkat ho rahi he, yah samoochee duniya dekh rahi he
 10

 13
 hamaare raaj main ab garib taqatvar banegaa
 Now he will become as powerful as he can overcome poverty
 14
 All our plans are to strengthen the poor of the country
 jitne zyada logon ko rojgaar denge, utana hi aapako phayda hoga
 15
 mahangaai ko paracepshan se na dekhen
 This is reality

 17
 sansad se hansi-majaak gaayab ho gaya he, yah chintaa kaa vishay he
 The reasoning behind Rahul Gandhi's refusal to take responsibility of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha is that it would not be right for him to become Leader of Opposition after such a big defeat
 log puch rahe hai ki yadi congress ke is tark main dam he, to phir rahul kaa party upaadhyaksh bane rahanaa kahaan tak uchit he
 Mallikarjun Kharge, the new Leader of the Opposition in the House, comes from Karnataka
 vah railmantri bhi rahe hai
 He has not lost any election in life, be it panchayat or assembly or Lok Sabha
 hindi bhi jaanate hai, urdu bhi or angreji bhi, lekin 71 saal ke khadge loksabhaa main narendra modi ke saamne kitne kaamyaab rahenge yah congress netaaon ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa
 If Kharge is there, then why is Kamal Nath not, why is Kamal Nath not, why not Captain Amarinder Singh, or Rahul
 
 
 congress main yah charchaa kaa vishay he
 At the contemplation camp in Jaipur, Rahul Gandhi said that power is equal to poison
 
 
 'power ij pijan'


kya yahi vajah he ki rahul bhaag rahe hai jimmedaariyon se
 It is also not a question of whether the leader of the opposition is from North India or from the South, it is necessary to be combative
 rahul, manmohan singh kii cabinet main yah kahkar jane se bachate rahe ki party ko majboot karnaa he or aisa to ho nahin sakaa
 Not even experienced working in government
 congressi saansad sawaal puch rahe hai ki kya yah acha nahin hota ki rahul vipaksh kaa netaa banate, loksabhaa ke aage kii bench par baithte or sarkaar se sawaal-jawaab karte
 Recall Sushma Swaraj's attack on UPA
 kuch galtiyaan karke seekhney ke bajaay kisi bahaane se jimmedaari se bachane ke raste par bhi sawaal hai
 People are also raising the question now that instead of giving youth leadership, why did the Congress go to the shelter of 71-year-old Kharge


 Rahul Gandhi's aura and an opportunity to fight this majority has been lost by Rahul Gandhi
 congress ke saath yah dikkat he ki jab saansadon ke manobal ko uthaane kii jarurat he or jab party gandhi parivaar kii taraf dekh rahi he, rahul kuch or soch rahe hai
 There is also a question in the minds of the people that can the President of Congress be none other than the Gandhi family? Will the Gandhi family be ready to take this risk? If you can become president in turn from Bangaru to Gadkari in BJP, then why not in Congress? aise main lagaataar sawaal uthne lage hai ki aakhir congress alaakaman ke paas koi aage kaa road map he bhi yaa nahin
 The use of holding elections in youth organizations was heavily beaten, but the thing that was done to stop it happened
 zyaadaatar jagah bade baap ke bete hi jitkar aae or vot kharidne ke dheron aarope bhi lage
 Due to the atmosphere created after the election, no team could be formed and the result is in front
 kya congress alaakaman ko yah nahin pataa ki jis rajya main congress do baar se satta main nahin ai he, us rajya main vah khatm ho gai he
 Mamta Banerjee leaves the Congress and forms a separate party and comes to power
 vajah saaf he ki vah jameen par lagaataar ladati raheen
 But the Congress ended there
 upi, madhya pradesh, gujarat, bihar, chhattisgarh, bengal, urisa ko mila den, to 225 seat hoti hai yahaan
 The circumstances of the Congress are well known
 
 It is not that the Congress does not have the votes, it has got 19 per cent votes against the bjp's 31 per cent
 aise main rahul ke saamne ek chunauti he ki vah ek saahsee senapati banakar maidan main utren, varanaa kisi or ke liye jagah khaali kar den, chaahe vah priyanka hi kyon na ho
 If power is poison, then one has to be ready to drink this poison in the Congress; if the party does not instill confidence in its workers, it will be what happens after every defeat
 
 
 party bikharane lagati he
 
 
 The renunciation of power seems good when you have power, as Sonia Gandhi did in 2004
 us vakt jimmedaari se kyon bhaagna jab sangharsh karne ke din hon
 Rahul ji
 
 
 salaahkaaron ke saath−saath soch bhi badalane kii jarurat he or party main bhi jaan foonkane kii
 That will be possible only when you show commitment
 rahul, congress ke liye aapako manmohan singh banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Remember your grandmother, know the incident of the scramble and prepare the party for a new fight
 bas intjaar karnaa hoga ek maukey kaa or jivan main maukey baar-baar nahin milte
 Indian society has an old relationship with poems
 agar baat aise kaviyon kii ho jinhone aazaadee kii ladaai se lekar, uske baad tak apni lekhnee se janata ko uske adhikaron ke prati jaagruk kiya ho, to unamemramdhaari singh dinakarka naam jarur aata he
 Today is the 110th birth anniversary of Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar
 dinakar kaa janm 23 sitambar 1908 ko bihar kebegusaraijile ke simriya gaanv main hua tha
 At the age of three, his childhood was spent in the absence of the shadow of his father
 lekin ghar par roj hone valeramcharitamanasake paath ne dinakar ke bheetar kavita or uski samaj ke beej bo die the
 Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh 'dinkar' not only gave a new height to the poetry of Veer Ras in Hindi literature, but also created national consciousness through his works
 isaki ek misaal 70 ke dashak main sampurna kranti ke daur main milti he
 At the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan, in front of thousands of people, had raised a revolt against the then government by proclaiming Dinkar's line 'empty the throne that the public comes'
 dinakar kii pehali rachana 'pranbhang' maani jaati he
 He wrote it in 1928
 iske baad dinakar ne 'renuka', 'hunkaar', 'kurukshetra', 'baapu', 'rashmirathi' likhaa
 In 'renuka' and 'hunkar', patriotism was so full that the British banned these books by being nervous
 dinakar ne nirbhik hokar angrejon ke khilaaf to likhaa hi, lekin aazaadee ke baad ke satta charitra ko bhi ujagar karne se nahin hichake
 Dinkar was among Jawaharlal Nehru's admirers
 lekin 1962 ke yuddh main sainikon kii maut ke mudde par vah nehru kii aalochana se bhi nahin chuke
 In 'waiting for Parasurama', he writes, it is fatal, which looks godlike, but, in the room, writes the wrong order, the sinner who does not have the virtue; Gotra is cute, understand, he has killed us here
 dinakar kaa pehla kavyasangrah ‘vijay sandesh’ varsh 1928 main prakashit hua
 After this he did many compositions
 unki kuch pramukh rachanaaen ‘parashuram kii pratiksha’, ‘hunkaar’ or ‘urvashi’ hai
 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in the year 1959
 padam bhushan se sammanit dinakar rajyasabha ke sadsy bhi rahe
 He was also conferred with the Jnanpith Award in the year 1972
 24 april, 1974 ko unka dehavsaan ho gaya
 Dinkar did most of his compositions in 'veer Ras'
 is bare main janamejay kehete hai, ‘bhushan ke baad dinakar hi ekmaatr aise kavi rahe, jinhone vir ras kaa khub istemaal kiya
 It was a period when the feeling of nationalism within the people was in full swing
 dinakar ne usee bhaavana ko apane kavita ke madhyam se aage badhaayaa
 He was the father of the nation, which is why he was also called the President
 ’desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai main bhi dinakar ne apana yogadan diya
 He was a great admirer of Bapu
 hindi sahitya ke bade naam dinakar urdu, sanskrit, maithili or angreji bhashaa ke bhi jaankaar the
 In the year 1999, the Government of India issued a stamp in his name
 bataa den, dinakar ne hindi kavita ko chhayavaad ke baaripan se mukti dilaakar use aam janata ke bich pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 This is the reason why even today, Dinkar's poetry remains on people's tongues
 rashtrakavi ramdhaari singh dinakar kii kuch kavitaayen
 
 1) kalam, aaj unki jai boljala asthiyaan baari-barichitakai jinamein chingaari,jo chadh gayi punyavedi paraliye bina gardan kaa molkalam, aaj unki jai bol

 This silky city of India is full of dust, wet with tears, India still in the grip of distress
 dilli main to he khub jyoti kii chahal-pahal, par, bhatak rahaa he sara desh andhere main
 Those who write fortune-sheets with a silk pen, have you ever wept with lack? Have you slept with your stomach full of sickness in collecting medicines for a child? 4
 parashuram kii pratikshahe vir bandhu ! daayi he koun vipad kaa ?ham doshi kisko kahen tumhaare vadh kaa ?yah gahan prashn; kaise rahasy samajhaayen ?das-bees adhik hon to ham naam ginayenper, kadam-kadam par yahan khadaa patak he,har taraf lagaaye ghaat khadaa ghaatak he5
 Summer is remaining
 
 
 
 Loosen the rope of the bow, open the tight end of the tarkas, Who said, the battle is gone, speak peacefully?

 amitabh ne apane blog main likhaa he ki khushi chali gai he kyonki 26 november ko hamaare shahar ne aatankwaadiyon ke hamalon ko jhela
 Due to this there is a reluctance somewhere inside me that prevents me from celebrating this festival

 He said that his family has not been celebrating Holi festival for the last few years due to the death of his father and mother

 rajasthan kii satta main congress sarkaar ke aane ke baad se sarkari yojanaon ke naam badale jane kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari he
 Especially the names of those schemes are being changed after the name of Deendayal Upadhyay, the founder of Jana Sangh
 gahalot sarakar ne dinadayal upaadhyaay varisht naagarik tirth yojana ke aage se pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kaa naam hataa diya he
 In this way, the scheme has once again been renamed as Chief Minister Senior Citizen Pilgrimage Scheme
 congress kaa tark he ki mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne apane pichley kaarykaal main is yojana kii shuruyaat kii thi
 At that time the name of the scheme was 'chief Minister Senior Citizen Pilgrimage Scheme', but after the BJP government led by Vasundhara Raje in 2013, after the coming to power, the name of this scheme was named Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay
 aise main ye yojana congress sarkaar kii thi, jise uske mul naam main se shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 Interestingly, before this, the Gehlot government had removed Deendayal Upadhyay's logo from the top of the land pattas
 iske alaava cabinet kii pehali baithak main gahalot sarkaar ne faisla kiya tha ki kisi bhi sarkari letters pad par pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kaa logo nahin chapa jayega
 At the same time, the BJP government had issued an order to celebrate Deendayal Upadhyaya birth centenary during his tenure
 isi maddenjar soobe main sabhi tarah ke sarkari patr vyavhaar main ashok stambh ke saath saath pandit dinadayal kaa logo lagane kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 Social Welfare Minister of the Congress Government, Master Bhanwarlal Meghwal, says that the Congress government does not deliberately change the name of any government scheme but if the BJP government has done any ill-will then the Congress government is correcting it
 vahiin, bijepi vidhayak ashok lahoti ne kaha ki congress vipaksh main thi to bijepi par aarope lagaati thi ki vah naam parivartan ke alaava koi kaam nahin karti he
 Ever since the Congress came to power in the state, only the name change is being done
 karnataka main siyaasi naatak jari he
 The ruling Congress- Janta Dal Secular (JDS) and rebel mlas are in the tug of a battle to save the government, topple the government
 kari dinon se chal rahe karnataka ke is naatak kaa ant kab hoga is sawaal ke saath yah charchaa bhi shuru ho gai he ki kya bajet satr main sarkaar gir jaaegi?congress pradesh kii apni gathbandhan sarkaar bachaane ke liye baghawat kar vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha dene vaale baagiyon ko manaane kaa purajor prayaas kar rahi he, to vahiin baagi vidhayak kisi bhi sthiti main istipha waapas na lene kii jid par ade hai
 The legislators, who are pressurizing them to accept the resignation, have been asked by the Speaker of the Assembly Ramesh Kumar to give the reason for the resignation in writing and also that he is voluntarily resigning
 vidhayakon ne in sabake bich guuruuvaar ko supreme court kaa darwaja khat-khata vidhansabha adhyaksh ko istife par faisla lene kaa aadesh dene kii apil kii, vahiin vidhansabha adhyaksh ne bhi adaalat main istife par faisla lene ke sambandh main koi aadesh na dene kii baat kahi
 Now whatever the decision of the court on Friday, there is no possibility of political heat from Bengal to Mumbai
 isaki bhi vajah he
 The monsoon session of the assembly is also starting from Friday, BJP is trying to pressurize the government to prove its majority
 maukey kii najaakat ko bhaanpate hue vidhansabha chunaav main 105 siton par jeet darj kar sabase badi party ke rup main ubharne or sarkaar banane ke baavjood congress-jedies gathbandhan ke kaaran beabaru hokar satta chhodane ko majaboor hui bhartiya janata party kumaraswami sarkaar par sadan main bahumat sabit karne kaa dabaav banane main jute gai he
 On the other hand, there are also reports that BJP has also offered Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister
 haalanki raajnneeti ke jaankaar ise khaarij karte hue kehete hai ki yadi vidhayakon kaa istipha manjuur hota he, to bhaajapa akele sarkaar bana sakati he
 At the same time, Congress staged a sit-in in Parliament to surround the BJP
 baagiyon kii maan-manouvval ke saath hi anyathaa kii sthiti main congress yah prayaas kar rahi he ki vidhansabha adhyaksh inhen ayogy tehra den
 The decision on resignation before voting in the house is to present the budget to the state government in this session
 aise main bhaajapa kii majboot gherebandi se jujh rahi kumaraswami sarkaar ke liye apano ke begaane hone se sankat or gaharaa ho gaya he
 The BJP has met the Governor and demanded a direction to prove his majority
 raajnneeti ke jaankaron kii maane to bhaajapa bajet prastut kiye jane ke dauraan hi vidhansabha main voting kara sakati he
 If this happens, the budget will not be passed
 aisi sthiti main sarkaar gir bhi sakati he
 According to the BJP officials who are making a ruckus, the BJP does not want to take any kind of risk this time
 isiilie party ne kumaraswami sarkaar ke khilaaf muhim to ched di he, lekin vah phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahi he
 The party is waiting for the resignation of the rebel mlas
 istipha manjuur hone ke baad 225 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 209 sadsy rah jaaenge
 In such a situation, the party with 105 mlas will touch the magic figure of absolute majority according to this arithmetic
 aise main mana yah ja rahaa he ki ranneeti ke tahat is puure ghatnakram se pallaa jhaad rahi bhaajapa rajyapal aadi se mulaakaat kar dhire-dhire maahaul banane main juty he
 On the other hand, the mlas who have resigned have reached the Supreme Court in an attempt to get their resignation approved
 sarvocch adaalat se lekar vidhansabha adhyaksh tak, nirnay chaahe jo bhi ho lekin monsoon kii barish ke bich karnataka main siyaasi tapish kam hoti najar nahin aa rahi
 The answer to all the questions will give time to come, but the current political developments are only pointing towards the farewell of Kumaraswamy government

 The issue of outsourcing has come up for discussion once

 News of the Philippine's emergence as the preferred location of voice-based BPO activity has sparked debate as to whether the outsourcing business will move from India

 Years ago, companies used to build their own huge IT teams
 jab kaam kaa boj badha to use gharelu companiyon ko outsource kar diya gaya
 After 2000, companies started outsourcing work to firms in other countries
 isaki vajah yah thi ki videshi model par bharosa jam gaya or bharat ek vishwasaneey desh ke rup main ubhara
 Multinationals set up development centers within Indian companies which led to the development of a foreign model
 bhartiya companiyaan un centaron ke prati puri tarah samarpit thim
 Contracts were based on the number of employees and the working hours
 is tarah, graahakon ke liye apni pariyojnaon par nigaraanee rakhana or gunvattta tathaa suraksha sunishchit karnaa aasaan ho gaya
 But today outsourcing is driven by demographics, economics, rapidly changing technological infrastructure, interconnected consumers and emerging economies

 Now business units are deciding which application they need, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is assessing the impact of the business and many decisions related to technology are being made at the board level as it impacts the entire organization

 In addition to IT service, BPO, engineering service and product design, the sector has also added legal service, architecture design, medical diagnostics and more recently home tuition
 yah bazaar na keval maujuuda kaarobaar main or sevaaon ke judane, balki nae-nae anusandhanon se bhi badha he
 But the story is not over yet

 Within India, companies are adopting a low-cost rural BPO model

 Business models of the outsourcing sector have also changed
 pehle prati ghante laagat ke aadhaar par contract hota tha, lekin ab yah bijness se hone vaali aay par nirbhar karata he
 In many cases, the price has to be determined on the basis of the utility model under which customers pay according to consumption
