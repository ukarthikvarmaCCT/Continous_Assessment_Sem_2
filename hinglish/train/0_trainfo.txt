 Only 5 percent remained poor
 10 main se chaar pakistani atyant garibi main rahete hai yani chalis fisadi pakistani garibi rekha ke neeche rahete hai

 5 percent of the population lives below the poverty line
 vishwa bank kaa apana paimaana he, bharat kaa apana paimaana he phir bhi garibi hakeekat to he hi
 a strange thing is that the leader always talks of poverty to save himself, the media does not always talk of poverty to save the leader
 vishwa bank ne apni report main aashaa vyakt kii he ki bangladesh agar isi tarah se aarthik sudhaar karata rahaa to 2030 tak garibi se mukt ho jayega

 bharat jidipi kaa 2

 It is not that the media does not report the suicides of farmers
 aati rahati hai
 But when the old recording of gun shot on TV started running, it is a problem

 The people of the village are getting martyred, the people of the village are committing suicide
 shahar ke log yuddh ke naam par video game khel rahe hai
 However, how to bring Prime Minister Modi's point to the debate that there should be a war against poverty and malnutrition
 pakistan ke akhbaar express tribune kii ek khabar he 21 june 2016 kii
 The multidisciplinary report on Pakistani poverty was then published
 is report main daawa kiya gaya he ki 2004 main 55 fisadi log garibi rekha se neeche the lekin 2015 main 29
 Only 5 percent remained poor
 10 main se chaar pakistani atyant garibi main rahete hai yani chalis fisadi pakistani garibi rekha ke neeche rahete hai
 Most people in Baluchistan are poor
 iskaa ek jila he kila abdulla jahaan 97 fisadi log garib hai
 Three out of four people in Phata area are poor
 sindh kii 43 fisadi aabaadi atyant garib he
 Reportedly 60 in Pakistan
 6 fisadi aabaadi ke paas rasoi gas nahin he
 48
 5 fisadi bachche skool kii shiksha puri nahin kar pate hai
 38 percent of the population lives in a one-room house
 pakistan kii aabaadi 18-19 karod he
 60 million people are poor
 vishwa bank kii bilkul haal-philhal kii report ke anusaar bharat or pakistan donon ke liye garibi ko mitaanaa ek chunauti bharaa kaam he
 According to the World Bank, Pakistan is one of the countries where the income of the poor is increasing very fast
 bharat un deshon main jahaan garibon kii aamadani ausat se kam raftaar par bad rahi he
 Whereas India is one of the world's fastest growing economies
 yah sab vishwa bank kii report main kaha gaya he
 According to this report, India is ahead of Pakistan in some areas and Pakistan is ahead of India in some areas
 bharat main 21
 9 percent of the population lives below the poverty line
 pakistan kii 29
 5 percent of the population lives below the poverty line
 vishwa bank kaa apana paimaana he, bharat kaa apana paimaana he phir bhi garibi hakeekat to he hi
 a strange thing is that the leader always talks of poverty to save himself, the media does not always talk of poverty to save the leader
 vishwa bank ne apni report main aashaa vyakt kii he ki bangladesh agar isi tarah se aarthik sudhaar karata rahaa to 2030 tak garibi se mukt ho jayega
 By the way, neither America nor Britain is free from poverty
 jivan pratyaasha yani bharat main ausatan log 68 saal tak jite hai jabaki pakistan main 66 saal tak
 37 per 1000 people in India according to 2015 data
 9 navjaat shishuon kii maut ho jaati he
 65 out of 1000 in Pakistan
 8 navjaat shishuon kii maut ho jaati he
 India is better than Pakistan in terms of malnutrition but also 15 in India
 2 pratishat log kuposhan ke shikaar hai
 If you compare on the basis of GDP then India's GDP 2
 07 trillian dollars kii he jabaki pakistan kii jidipi 270 billian kii
 We are in trillions and they are in billions
 parcheging power yani kray shakti ke maamle main donon desh aasapaas hi hai
 Per capita income of Pakistan 4,450
 00 yues dollar he
 India's per capita income of 4,735
 00 yues dollar he
 In India, 74 out of a hundred have mobile phones, 73 in Pakistan
 kis aadhaar par mobile phone suchakank banataa ja rahaa he mujhe nahin pataa, lekin zikr karne main kya harz he
 When India and Pakistan fight war on poverty, they will also have to consider the budget spent on the army
 bharat jidipi kaa 2
 Pakistan spends 42% on security then Pakistan - 3 of GDP
 57%
 On Wednesday, on the petition of Swaraj Abhiyan, the Supreme Court has made very strict remarks in the case of deaths due to malnutrition in Maharashtra

 This historic building and the lake built around it and Rs 3,500 crore

 It was leased for 99 years at a nominal amount of Rs
 court ne aise kai faislon ko avaidh tehraaya, jinase is nijee form ko laabh pahunchaaya gaya tha
 The verdict is a shock to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, whose close friend and owner of the Kalpataru Group, Moffatraj Munot, had half the stake in the project

 The judgment of Chief Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Mahesh Bhagwati may set a precedent for preventing such open disturbances and corruption in water bodies, land and historic buildings
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki sarkaar jameen, jhil or aitihaasik imaarat ko 99 varsh ke liye lij par nahin de sakati
 The court ruled that the project was purely commercial, not for entertainment
 adaalat ne jhil kii jameen or jhil ke 13 fisadi hisse ko mitti se paat kar hotel banane ke liye kiye gaye aavanton ko khaarij kar diya
 In a very decisive judgment, the court also rejected the establishment of the committee which had decided in 2009 to give unprecedented benefits to this private company

 Government officials also lied before the High Court that environmental clearance has been obtained from the Central Government for this, which was not done
 hycourt ne yah aadesh uchit hi diya he ki jhil ko uske mul swaroop main waapas laayaa janaa chahie or iskaa kharch jalmahal resorts privet limited se vasula janaa chahie
 This private company spent six crores on renovating the historic building
 kharch kiye hai, lekin sarkaar ne apni vibhinn sansthaaon ke jariye jhil ko shandaar sthiti main laakar group ko saunpane par 35 se 40 karod ru
 So that the group can build two hotels of 400 rooms here
 congress sarkaar or uske adhikariyon ne puri pariyojna par kaam karte hue is tathy ko chipaaya ki yahaan puure do hotel banaae ja rahe hai
 The public was told that there would be trails and open restaurants around the lake, but this land was to be used to build a 400-room hotel
 yah sawaal har vyakti kar rahaa tha ki jab sarkaar jhil or uske aasapaas kii jameen par 35 se 40 karod ru
 If you can afford it, why not spend it on the historical building and maintain it as your property, like she does of Mount Abu's Nakki Lake

 In order to investigate the role of Gehlot, Munot, Kothari and officers, there should be an inquiry from the Central Bureau of Investigation under the supervision of the court

 In this era of all-round presence of sex, parents and schools are widening the gap between teenagers and adults with the initiative, which has led to confusion and panic in children's minds

 Just then, an enchanted teacher dragged Sambit and Tanaz to the Supervisor's room

 ’’dosti or vishwaas par isaki dohari maar pad rahi he
 The friendship between Sambit and Tanaz is now starting to crack because Sambit feels that he should not be made a villain
 sowani kahati hai, ‘‘bachche skool ko bharosemand jagah ke taur par dekhte hai
 She tells of a schoolboy from South Mumbai who came to school with a porn CD to show friends, a girl who was using her brother's mobile phone, and the family got pornographic clips on it
 aise maamalon main skool aisi takneekon kaa istemaal pratibandhit kar dete hai, skool se nikaalane kii dhamkee dete hai
 The parents are then summoned and the child is reprimanded

 agar aap is kaam ke maharathi hai to apane nazariye ko majboot karne ke liye aapako vibhinn kshamtaaon vaale logon ke saath judsa chahie or milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 In today's digital world, which has digital technology at its core, it is very important to be multidimensional

 Take IBM, for example
 ham log alag-alag dhaaraon ke chaatro kii bhartee kar rahe hai, jaise statisticks, libral atrs, dizin, iconomics, kanoon ityadi
 The knowledgeable and experienced candidate of more than one subject is not only of a rich attitude but also has more ability to adapt to any situation and is willing to take risks
 mere nijee anubhav ne mujhe ek cheez sikhaai he—sirf alag-alag chizon ke bare main jaananaa hi kaaphi nahin he, balki hamen hatakar sochane kii bhi aadat honi chahie or bhavishya ke hisaab se sahi najariya bhi hamaare bheetar hona chahie
 My advice to today's youth would be to develop the ability to fill in the blanks and keep a specific vision in mind
 apane vishleshnatmak or sanvadatmak kaushal ko or tikhaa karen tathaa aisa vyaktitv viksit karen jo aapako dusron se alag darsha sake
 To make you different in the crowd
 shaikshanik or peshewar gyaan ek saath len, aupchaarik or anaupchaarik donon hi sroton se seekhen, peshewar paathyakram chune or apane shauk ko viksit karen
 i know a young man who is a major in physics and optics but is a minor in photography, who is fond of him
 chaatro or sansthaanon ke liye buniyadi salaah ek hi he ki aap yah sweekaar kar len ki ham ek aise digital or gyanatmak daur main hai jo hamaare jeene or kaam karne ke tareekon ko badal rahaa he
 The way to understand more than one subject will be able to prepare us for this era and make it suitable for the world to come

 com / pzy72m9rpn Input - IANS duty kii tanaavpurn prakruti ke kaaran apana janmdin yaa shaadi kii saalagirah manaane main aksham centre shasit (uti) pradesh chandigarh ke pulicekarmiyon ko ab muskaraane kii vajah mil gai he
 Actually, now he can be discharged on these special days
 uti chandigarh polisake aiji arapy upaadhyaay ne faisla kiya he ki chandigarh police ke sabhi pulicekarmiyon ko unke janmdin or shaadi kii saalagirah ke din duty se aaraam dekar apane parivaar or priyajanon ke saath rahane kaa mauka diya jayega
 According to the press release issued by Chandigarh Police, the nature of work of policemen is inherently tense
 unhen duty par lambey samay tak ke liye, saptahanth main or chuttee vaale din bhi kaam karnaa hota he or inaki duty main bhi lagaataar badlaav aate rahete hai
 As a result, most policemen are unable to celebrate special occasions in their personal lives such as birthdays and wedding anniversaries
 baharhaal, aise pulicekarmi jinaki shaadi nahin hui, jo vidhwaa yaa vidhur, talakshuda hai, ve is din kii chuttee koshaadi kii saalagirahake badale apane jivan se jude kisi or khaas maukey par istemaal kar sakate hai
 - input language bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke netaa rajeev babbar kii taraf se dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf manahani ke ek mukademe kii sunwaayee ko dilli kii rouj avenue court ne loksabhaa chunaav khatm hone tak taal diya he
 Arvind Kejriwal was to appear in the defamation case on Tuesday
 jaise hi maamle kii sunwaayee shuru hui kejariwal kii taraf se pesh hue vakeelon ne kaha ki aaj mukhyamantri dilli main nahin he, ve chunaav prachaar ke liye haryana main he
 Therefore, Kejriwal should be exempted from personal appearance during the court hearing
 court main kejariwal ke vakil ke taraf se mukhyamantri kaa kaarykram saunpane ke baad court ne kejariwal ko peshi se chhot de di
 The court will now hear the matter on June 7
 kejariwal ke alaava is maamle main AAP ke saansad susheel gupta, party netaa aatishi or aadmi party party ke vidhayak manoj kumaar ko bhi pesh hone ko kaha gaya tha
 The court has said that everyone will have to appear in the next date
 aarope tha ki mukhyamantri ne soshal media par logon ko bijepi ke khilaaf bhadakaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Lied to the voters that the vote of Vaishya and some other castes has been cut by BJP
 rajeev babbar ne apni yachika main kaha he ki yah puri tarah se managasaint or bijepi ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh ke tahat jaanboojhkar kiya gaya he
 Which includes Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and some leaders of his party
 rajeev babbar ne apni yachika main kaha he ki kejariwal ne 8 disambar 2018 ko twit kar daawa kiya tha ki dilli main agarwal samaaj ke kul aath lakh vot hai
 The leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party had claimed that the BJP cut about four lakh votes from them
 matlab 50 fisadi
 Till date this society was a staunch voter of BJP
 is baar notebandi or GST kii vajah se ye naaraaz hai to bhaajapa ne inke vot hi katwa die
 Although the Election Commission rejected the claim of the Aam Aadmi Party, in this case it was made clear in the affidavit given by the Election Commission that on the basis of caste and religion, it does not keep the data of the voters
 iske alaava chunaav ayog swatantra sanstha he or koi bhi raajnneetik party dabaav nahin daal sakati
 BJP leader Rajiv Babbar had filed a criminal defamation case against Kejriwal and others, the court had sent summons on the previous date and ordered all the accused including Kejriwal to appear in the court
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee 7 june ko hogi

 But when the election time comes, such statements of political parties and their leaders are left as mere jumle
 bhartiya janata party ho yaa congress, sabhi dalon ke tikat vitaran main mahilaon kii hissedari kam hi najar aati he
 In particular, the Congress, which demands 33 percent reservation for women, also seems to be behind in this list

 The Congress has given tickets to women in only 9 seats for the 90-seat Haryana Assembly elections
 yani vidhansabha main bhagidaari ke liye sirf 10 fisadi mahilaon ko hi mauka diya gaya he
 The position of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is more or less similar to that of the Congress
 haalanki, bijepi mahilaon ko tikat dene ke maamle main congress se thodaa aage he
 The party has given women candidates an opportunity to contest on 12 of the 90 seats

 The INLD has relied on 15 women candidates this time
 haalanki, jejepi ne sirf 7 mahilaon ko hi tikat die hai
 But when it comes to the Congress, it has given fewer women to contest elections than in the 2014 assembly elections

 Mathematics is a subject that many children love very much, while some remain in awe of this subject
 aapane bhi kai baar apane bachche ke dil main is vishay ke prati interest paidaa karne ke liye use kaha hoga ki yah ek scoring subject he
 By doing a little hard work on this subject, you can easily get full marks
 lekin us samay kya vaaki aap apane bachche kii manovastha samaj rahe hote hai
 Let me tell you that, due to excessive pressure on children, they start getting tense
 isaki vajah se thode samay baad unhen is vishay se hi nafrat ho jaati he
 According to a recent study, due to the increasing hatred for Maths among children, they are now becoming victims of Maths Envy
 centre for neurosience in ajukeshan dwaara kii gai ek study main pataa chalaa ki zyaadaatar bachche maths kii vajah se tanaav kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 In this study, parents and school teachers of the children were given the reason for their stress
 yah shodh 1000 italian bacchon or 1700 landan main rahane vaale bacchon par kiya gaya
 After doing these studies well, the researchers came to the conclusion that girls are more prone to maths envy than boys studying in primary and secondary school
 study main is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua ki aisa isliye hota he kyonki bachche pehle hi is vishay ko mushkil samaj lete hai
 Because of which they start getting tense
 iske alaava is vishay main kam ang praapt karne kaa dar bhi unhen is tanaav se ubarne nahin detaa he
 Dennis, who has done this research, says, 'it is true that' maths envy 'can happen in every child for a different reason, but through our research we have found some reasons which are the same in both primary and secondary children
 
 'is shodh main ek or baat jo saamne nikalakar ai wo thi ki skool main teachers ke padhaane kaa style
 Yes, in this study, the children themselves have complained that this subject is taught differently in their school due to which they often get confused
 vahiin secondary skool ke bacchon kaa kahana tha ki parents or doston ke saath kharaab rishton kii vajah se unhen tanaav rahata he
 Apart from this, children are also getting stressed due to increasing pressure of studying with every class
 vaise hairaani to is baat kii he ki jo bachche maths main majboot he, wo bhi kai maukon par tanaav mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, children who are good in maths, their parents always have meaning only by their marks
 aisa karne se un bacchon main dhire-dhire tanaav badhane lagata he or wo bhavishya main us field main bhi parform nahin kar pate jahaan wo behatar hote hai
 According to the researchers, they consider this growing trend quite worrisome
 unke anusaar bachche is tarah se ek tarah ke chakravyuu main funs jate hai
 From where they will be very difficult in the future
 unke mutabik pehle maths anzity ke chalate bachche acha parform nahin karenge or phir kam marks laane kii vajah se tanaav se peedit honge
 Researchers in this study have also emphasized some important options to solve this problem
 unhone bataaya ki is pareshaani se nijaat paane ke liye sabase pehle skool ke teachers ko is baat ko sweekaar karnaa hoga ki bacchon bhi maths anzity kaa shikaar ho sakate hai
 Which has a direct impact on their performance
 iske alaava teachers ko bacchon ko padhaane ke apane style main bhi jaruri parivartan laana chahie
 Not only this, parents of children should also take care that the pressure on children for maths can have a bad effect on children
 shodhakartaaon ne ummind jataai ki agar in samaadhaanon par amal kiya jaae to jald hi sthiti main sudhaar laayaa ja saktaa he
 He also acknowledged that the present situation is very worrying
 ek shodh ke mutabik euke main har paanch main se ek insaan ko maths kii problem sulajhane main dikkat hoti he

 Ashwin is the third Indian cricketer to score 500 runs in a single season and take 50 wickets

 If your team is in good condition then the opposition team will definitely suffer

" agar aapaki team acchhee sthiti main he to nishchit rup se vipakshi team jujhegi
 In my opinion, if the team has an edge, then the batsmen and bowlers of that particular team will look more dangerous

 com / bnbntvtqip Shiv sena-ncp-congress challenged Fadnavis government, Congress had given to Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka, Challenge court ordered Yeddyurappa to test floor test in 2018, BS Yeddyurappa had given resignation after an emotional speech, the political picture in Maharashtra is changing rapidly
 maharashtra ke rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne shanivaar ko devendra fadanvis ko mukhyamantri or ajit pavaar ko upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath dilaai
 The Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Shiv Sena have challenged this in the Supreme Court
 justise envi raman, justise ashok bhushan or justise sanjeev khanna kii bench ravivaar ko is maamle par sunwaayee karne vaali he
 The way political developments are moving forward, it seems that the political situation of Kimhara has reached the turning point where Karnataka politics reached in 2018
 maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan laga hua tha lekin shanivaar subah jo kuch hua uski kalpana kisi ne nahin kii thi
 Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as CM
 isse puure siyaasi galiyare main sabhi hairaan rah gaye
 By evening, the matter reached the Supreme Court
 maharashtra main nai sarkaar ko lekarshivsena, congress or ensipine supreme court main yachika daakhil karke rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ke us aadesh ko radd karne kii maang kii he, jisamen unhone soobe main sarkaar banane ke liye devendra fadanvis ko aamantrit kiya tha
 The Supreme Court will hear the petition of the three parties
 yah sunwaayee supreme court kii court number 2 main aaj subah 11:30 baje hogi
 In the petition filed in the Supreme Court, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP also claimed the support of 154 mlas in the 288-member Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 teenon partiyon ne supreme court se anurodh kiya ki adaalat jald se jald or sambhav ho to ravivaar ko hi vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaakar floor test kaa nirdesh de
 This will make it clear whether the majority is with Uddhav Thackeray or with Devendra Fadnavis
 2018 main kya hua tha karnataka main?ab sawaal he ki maharashtra kaa siyaasi ghatnachakra kya vahiin pahunch gaya he, jahaan 2018 main karnataka kii raajnneeti pahunch gai thi
 In fact, after the assembly elections in Karnataka in 2018, Governor Vajubhai Vala invited the largest party BJP to form the government and BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa was sworn in as Chief Minister
 rajyapal ne sabase adhik siton par jeet hasil karne vaali party matlab bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya
 But the Congress and the JDS have opposed it and approached the Supreme Court
 donon dalon ne supreme court ke saamne fouran floor test karaae jane kii maang rakhi
 The Supreme Court ordered BS Yeddyurappa, who was sworn in as Chief Minister, to prove his majority
 us dauraan karnataka main bijepi ke paas 104 vidhayak the or mana ja rahaa tha ki uske liye congress or jedies ke vidhayakon ko todna aasaan nahin he
 Earlier, the governor gave Yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority in the assembly
 is par congress kaa kahana tha ki aisa karke rajyapal ne vidhayakon kii kharid-farost ke liye rasta saaf kar diya he
 Later, the Congress challenged it in the Supreme Court and the court said that on May 19, 2018, a majority would have to be proved at 4 pm
 bijepi kii sarkaar vidhansabha main floor test kaa saamana nahin kar saki or mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ne istipha de diya
 After this, the BJP made a lot of efforts in Karnataka to form the congress-jds coalition government and continuously created an atmosphere that it has the support of Congress and some JDS mlas
 lekin aakhirkaar ye sab dharaa rah gaya
 On May 19, Yeddyurappa made an emotional speech in the assembly before proving majority in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly and then announced his resignation
 matlab saaf tha ki unke paas bahumat nahin tha
 Now a similar picture is being made in Maharashtra
 haalanki abhi yah dekhnaa hoga ki rashtravaadi congress or shivasena kii yachika par supreme court kya faisla sunaata he
 However, whatever the decision may be, but everyone's eyes are on the events of passing through the streets of Maharashtra's law

 kisi jamaane ke eks-lovers rah chuke ranbir kapur or deepika padukon kii on-screen chemistry kaa aaj bhi koi jawaab nahin he
 After a long affair, when the news of their breakup came out, the fans of both were quite surprised
 parde par sabase pehle yah jodi dekhne ko mili saal 2008 kii hit film 'bachanaa i haseenon' main
 But even after the breakup, both the films 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' proved to be a big hit
 deepika or ranbir kaa maananaa he ki wo bahut achche dost hai
 Everyone knows that these days Ranbir Kapoor is in a relationship with Katrina Kaif in his personal life
 vahiin duusari taraf deepika padukon ko bhi bollywood star ranvir singh main apana partner dikh gaya
 But when Deepika was asked in an interview whether she still loves Ranbir Kapoor, she replies, 'absolutely
 mujhe nahin lagata ki breacup ke naam par har feeling yaa imoshan tut jaataa he
 Deepika admits that once upon a time she used to be positive for Ranbir Kapoor
 deepika bataati hai, 'ranbir ek aisa shaks he jise maine hameshaa pyaar kiya he or main uske liye hameshaa pajesive or protective rahuungi
 Whenever i read about him or see his work, i always share my thoughts with him
 halanki ham do alag alag insaan hai or vahi karenge jo ham karnaa chaahate hai lekin hamaare bich main aisa comfort jone he ki ham apane man kii koi bhi baat ek duusare se share kar sakate hai
 'ranbir Kapoor himself also admits,' i have loved Deepika just like home

 Both of us have positively moved forward in our own lives

 a post shared by Karan Johar (@karanjohar) on May 7, 2018 at 9:16am PDTA post shared by Voompla (@voompla) on May 8, 2018 at 11:40am PDTA post shared by Voompla (@voompla) on May 8, 2018 at 11:48am PDT Parliament is not taking the name of stopping the deadlock over GST, while the tax structure is to be improved with its implementation
 agar yah bill lagu ho jaataa he to isse na sirf tex bharna aasaan hoga, balki tex kii chori bhi rukegi
 Its implementation is also necessary to speed up the economy by increasing the country's GDP
 aaie jaanate he aakhir GST bill he kya? saath hi kya hai iske phaayde or nuksaan jiske chalate daav-pench funs rahe hai
 It was first mentioned in the General Budget of India in the year 2006-07
 centre or rajya ke bich apratyaksh karon ke bantwaare ko lekar vivaadon main rahaa vastu evam seva kar hameshaa hi charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Despite this, only few people will know about it
 or shaayad ye pataa hoga ki aakhir kyon is par itane sawaal khadey kiye ja rahe hai
 What is GST Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax
 jiesti ke tahat vastuon or sevaaon par ek samaan kar lagaaya jaataa he
 Where GST is not applicable, separate taxes are levied on goods and services
 sarkaar agar is bill ko 2016 se lagu kar detii to har saamaan or har seva par sirf ek tex lagegaa yani waite, exise or sarvice tex kii jagah ek hi tex lagegaa
 What will be its benefits? In any state, the common man will be the biggest beneficiary of the implementation of one price of goods GST
 puure desh main kisi bhi saamaan ko kharidne ke liye ek hi tex chukaana hoga
 That is, the price of any goods in the whole country will remain the same
 jaise koi car agar aap dilli main kharidte hai to uski keemat alag hoti he, vahiin kisi or rajya main usee car ko kharidne ke liye alag keemat chukaani padati he
 With its implementation, any goods will be available at the same rate in any state
 kar vivaad main cammgar yah lagu ho jaataa he to kai baar tex dene sechhutkaaraa mil jayega
 This will also reduce the possibility of tax fraud by tax department officials while collecting tax
 ek hi vyakti yaa sanstha par kai baar tex lagane kii jarurat nahin padegi, sirf isi tex se saare tex vasuul kar liye jaaenge
 Apart from this, where revenue will increase in many states, there will also be a decrease in prices in many places
 kam hogi saamaan kii keemtiske lagu hone se tex kaa dhaancha paardarshee hoga jisase kaaphi had tak tex vivaad kam honge
 After its implementation, the VAT, entertainment tax, luxury tax, lottery tax, entry tax, etc
 will be abolished
 philhal jo saamaan kharidte samay logon ko us par 30-35 pratishat tex ke rup main chukaana padataa he wo bhi ghatakar 20-25 pratishat par aa jane kii sambhaavna he
 Apart from this, India's growth rate will also increase by one to one and a half percent
 jiesti lagu hone par companiyon or vyapaariyon ko bhi phayda hoga
 There will be no problem in moving the goods from one place to another
 jab saamaan banane kii laagat ghategi to isse saamaan sasta bhi hoga
 Who will be harmed While the implementation of GST will benefit the Center, the states feared that it will harm them because after this they will not be able to collect many types of taxes, which will reduce their earnings
 gauratlab he ki petrol va dijal se to kai rajyon kaa aadha bajet chalata he
 Keeping this in mind, the Center while giving relief to the states has approved that they continue to tax on these items in the initial years
 rajyon kaa jo bhi nuksaan hoga, centre uski bharpai paanch saal tak karegaa

 i agree with Shashi Tharoor that his natural charisma will inspire activists and voters alike
 aashaa he seedblusi is par jald faisla karegaa

 The proposal for a women's free trip in DTC and cluster buses in the capital Delhi may come in the cabinet meeting next week
 parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ke mutabik isse sambandhit cabinet note taiyaar kar liya gaya he
 On August 15, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the journey will be free for women in Delhi's DTC and cluster buses from October 29
 'ajtak' ke khaas baatcheet main parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ne kai ahm jaankariyaan saajha kii hai
 He informed that there are around 3500 DTC and 1500 cluster buses in Delhi
 ditisi bason main rojaanaa 31 lakh or cluster bason main 12 lakh yatri safar karte hai
 Out of these 43 lakh total passengers, an average of 33 percent are considered female travelers
 kailash gahalot ne free safar se sarkaar ke jariye kharch kii jaankaree dete hue kaha ki mahilaon ko bason main muft safar karaane ke liye ditisi bason kaa 200 karod or cluster bason kaa 114 karod rupee kaa salanaa kharch aayega
 The government will give a total of Rs 314 crore
 saath hi mantri kailash gahalot ne bataaya ki har bas yatra ke liye mahilaon ko gulabi rang kaa paas diya jayega
 New buses will come, however, the biggest question here is that if the buses are crowded with the announcement of free travel, what are the arrangements for the government? In response to the question, Minister Kailash Gehlot told 'aaj Tak', the government believes that ridership should increase, this decision is related to women's safety
 public transport ko duniya main sabase surakshit saadhan mana jaataa he
 Women feel safe in DTC and cluster buses
 agar faisla lagu hone ke baad bheed badhati he to uske liye bhi sarkaar taiyaar he
 New buses will start coming on Delhi roads from next month
 mantri kailash gahalot ne daawa kiya he ki dilli main is saal standard floor basen aana shuru ho jaaengi
 Gehlot said, 'I hope that every month after September 100 buses will join the government camp
 iske alaava ek hajaar lo floor cluster bason kaa work award kar diya gaya he
 Also electric buses are coming

 saal 2010 kii baat he, rashtramandal khelon ke dauraan pehali baar dilli kii sadakon par i-rickshaw utre
 They were used for movement in Khelgaon
 apane khulepan ke kaaran us samay videshi sailaaniyon ko lubhaane vaale i-rickshaw apni isi khubi ke kaaran aaj dilli samet desh ke kai rajyon main aam janata kii jarurat ban chuke hai
 E-rickshaws have emerged as the best option for last mile connectivity from the metro station to office or home to vegetable market
 nitiyon ke abhaav main i-rickshaw ne sadakon par aise jagah banaai ki aaj dilli-ensiaar samet desh ke kai rajyon main ye samasya banakar daud rahe hai
 According to Dimpy Suneja, research associate at the Transport and Urban Governance Division of The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI), "there are about nine lakh e-rickshaws in the country at present
" dilli main inaki taadaad sabase zyada—kareeb 2 lakh he
 After this, the major states are West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Bihar and Tripura based on the number of e-rickshaws
 '' kuchhek rajyon ke gine-chune shaharon main hi i-rickshaw chal rahe hai
 For example, Nagpur in Maharashtra
 dimpi yah bhi kehete hai, "desh main chal rahe 60-65 fisadi i-rickshaw gaiyr kanoonee hai
 This problem is the biggest in delhi-ncr
 ''2016 main terry kii ore se jari report ke mutabik dilli main mahaj 30 se 35 fisadi i-rickshaw hi registerd the, jabaki uttar pradesh ke kuch shaharon jaise lakhanu, varanasi, bareli main registerd i-rickshaw kaa pratishat mahaj 20 se 22 fisadi hi tha
 Whether rickshaw is legal or illegal, more than convenience has become a necessity for the common man
 gaiyr kanoonee kyon ho gaye i-rickshaw?2012-13 main jab sadakon par i-rickshaw apni pakad majboot bana rahe the tab inhen pedal rickshaw kaa vikalp samajha gaya
 Since no registration or license was required for ordinary rickshaws, it was assumed that they would not be needed for e-rickshaws and they grew randomly
 local welding kii dukaan se lekar factriyon tak dhadlle se i-rickshaw banane or bikne lage
 E-rickshaws made of unauthorized standards become fatal
 dilli main bekaabu i-rickshaw se hue dardanaak haadason ke baad adaalat kaa chaabuk chalaa or sarkaar kii bhi neend khuli
 On July 31, 2014, the Delhi High Court banned e-rickshaws in a PIL filed on the issue of safety
 iske baad march 2015 main sansad ne motor whical (sanshodhan) kanoon 2015 main badlaav kar i-rickshaw ko kanoonee banaaya
 But by the time this law was implemented in the states, lakhs of e-rickshaws had come on the roads
 kanoon banane ke baad sarkaar ne pehle se chal rahe i-rickshaw ko registerd karaane kaa mauka to diya lekin rickshaw chaalkon kaa ravaiya iske prati udasin dikhaa
 Pawan Kakkar, vice-president of the Battery Rickshaw Welfare Association, states, "two samples of illegal rickshaws were taken from the Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI) and the International Center for Automotive Technology (ICAT) and the rest were based on these standards
 Invited to make changes
 iske liye pehle chah maah kaa samay tay kiya gaya, baad main taarikh bhi badhaai gai lekin maalikon ne apane rickshaw registerd nahin karwaae
 Only 2,000 rickshaws were registered in Delhi
 isaki vajah darasal is process main aane vaala lagbhag 15,000 rupye kaa kharch tha
 "the average price of a registered rickshaw with the number of contractors" is 1 in the market
 10 se 1
 50 lakhs between Rs
 isamen ek saal kaa insurance, registration, license banavaane kii laagat shaamil he
 On the other hand, the numberless e-rickshaw in the market is Rs 60 to 66,000
 main mil jaataa he
 Kakkar says, "there are two big reasons behind illegal rickshaw driving
 pehla, zyaadaatar i-rickshaw thekedaaron ke hai or doosraa, kanoon kaa sakhti se paalan nahin hona
 "those who drive e-rickshaws in the area of noida, East Delhi, say that e-rickshaws are available for Rs
 350 per day
" police ke pakadaaey se lekar parking or charging tak kii jimmedaari unheen kii hoti he
 People who are running their e-rickshaws have to pay 100 to 130 rupees for parking and charging
 thekedaar niyamon ko taak par rakhkar saste gaiyr-kanoonee rickshaw chalava rahe hai
 According to Kakkar, "most of the illegal e-rickshaws operating in Delhi belong to contractors
 ''department kaa dardabada sawaal yah he ki police kii naak ke neeche itani badi sankhya main gaiyr-kanoonee i-rickshaw chal rahe hai to in par karrwai kyon nahin hoti? dilli parivahan vibhaag ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, "sadakon se i-rickshaw na hatane kii sabase badi vajah scrap policy kaa na hona he
 If the police department also confiscates e-rickshaws in real time, then there is no system to keep them
 scrap par koi niti na hone kii vajah se inhen nasht bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "this is the reason why e-rickshaws caught in many places in delhi-ncr are inundated
 na to inhen koi adaalat se chhudaane aata he or na hi police department inhen chhod saktaa he
 The official also mentioned, "the Delhi government is working on a scrap policy
 iske amal main aate hi badi sankhya main i-rickshaw sadakon se hat jaaenge
 Sohinder Gill, director general of the Chosen Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles on the vote bank, says, "the e-rickshaw market has had a huge tussle since the beginning
 adaalaton ne rickshaw bain kar diya lekin uske baad bhi sadakon par rickshaw aate rahe
 ICAT, ARAI made strict rules, so the government and political parties were always advocating concessions by calling for poor rickshaw pullers
 sarkaar darasal i-rickshaw ko automobile kii tarah handle nahin kar pai
