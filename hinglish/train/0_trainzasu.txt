 Ironically, when the Congress was in power, the BJP opposed it and when the BJP was there, the Congress
 modi sarkaar bhi satta sanbhaalane ke baad se is kar sudhaar ko lagu karne ke liye prayasarat thi lekin use safalataa ab mili he kareeb do saal baad
 The much awaited GST will be launched in India at midnight of 30 June
 aaj ham aapako bataate hai ki jo bijepi aaj jiesti
 
 
 GST is opposing it once
 or jo congress aaj isse munh pher kar khadi he usee ne sabase pehle ise lagu karne kii baat kii thi, usee ne jiesti kaa sapana dekha tha
 Let us tell you that tax reform like GST started in India when the Prime Minister of the country was Rajiv Gandhi and the former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh was handling the Finance Ministry
 ve pi singh ne farvari 1986 main modiphoid waite (MODVAT) introdeus kiya tha
 It was very much like GST
 isane desh ke liye ekmaatr tex system kii neenv rakh di thi
 Manmohan Singh, finance minister in PV Narasimha Rao's government, started the initial discussion about the value added tax at the state level after the Raja Chelia Committee appointed to suggest reforms in direct and indirect tax
 thik aise hi jab yashavanth sinha atal bihari vaajapeyi ke vitt mantri the, to 1 janvari 2000 se rajyon ke bich bikri kar kii ladaai ko samaapt karne ke liye or vibhinn vastuon ke bikri karon ke liye ek samaan dar rakhane ke liye nirnay liya tha
 More importantly, to oversee the implementation, Sinha set up a committee of state finance ministers in 2000 headed by the then West Bengal Finance Minister Aseem Dasgupta
 dasgupta is cameti ke 2011 tak adhyaksh rahe
 The most important for GST was 2004, when the task force headed by the then Finance Ministry adviser Vijay L
 Kelkar said that the current tax system in the country had many flaws
 unhone hi desh hit main ek vyapak jiesti kaa suzav diya tha haalanki unhone rajyon ke liye nunatam 7% or kendra ke liye nunatam 5% dar kaa suzav diya tha
 After this, a fresh discussion on equal tax started in the country
 2004 main endie ke haar ke baad jab upie satta main ai or manmohan sarkaar main pi
 When Chidambaram became finance minister, he too continued to work on GST
 unhone rajyon ko vittiya sahaayta muhaiyaa karaane ke uddeshy se waite kii shuruyaat ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya
 Chidambaram during his tenure indicated the introduction of GST in all budget speeches
 unhone 1 april 2010 se jiesti lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 But the talks about the opposition of the states did not catch pace
 2009 main bharat ke nae vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne jiesti ke basic strecchar kii ghoshnaa kii or ise 1 april 2010 se lagu karne ke sarkaar ke lakshya ko doharaaya
 It was only in 2009 that the Aseem Dasgupta Committee presented its first decision paper on the GST to the public and sought suggestions on it
 iske baar farvari 2010 main mahatvapurn kadam uthaate hue upie sarkaar ne rajyon main commercial tex ke computarigeshan project kii shuruyaat kii
 This was considered as the foundation of GST
 march 2011 menmanmohan sarkaarne jiesti lagu karne ke liye lok sabha main samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak pesh kiya
 Opposition parties, especially BJP, strongly opposed this
 jiske baad is vidheyak ko purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha kii adhyakshata vaali sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke paas bhej diya gaya
 In 2012, the Standing Committee discussed it and objected to certain portions
 november 2012 main tatkaaleen vitt mantri chidambaram ne rajyon ke vitt mantriyon ke saath baatcheet kii jiske baad sabhi muddon ko sulajhane ke liye 31 disambar 2012 kii samay seemaa tay kii gai
 The most important thing happened in 2013, in August the Standing Committee submitted its report to Parliament
 panel ne is vidheyak ko kuch sanshodhano ke saath apni manjuuri di
 After this, opposition to this bill started by BJP
 oktober main gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ne or unke vitt mantri ne iskaa vyapak virodh kiya
 The then Finance Minister of Gujarat Saurabh Patel had said that if the Manmohan government implements GST by bringing the ordinance, then Gujarat will incur a loss of Rs 14 thousand crore every year
 2014 main satta parivartan ke saath hi congress ke liye jiesti sapana hi rah gaya
 But Mododi and Jaitleyke had also made GST home in their minds
 isi vajah se satta main aane ke kuch hi maheenon baad disambar 2014 main vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main is bill ko pesh kiya
 It was now Congress's turn to protest
 congress ne is bill ko sthaayee samiti ke paas bhejne kii maang kii
 In May 2015, the Lok Sabha passed the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill but in August the bill got stuck in the Rajya Sabha
 congress ne jiesti dar par khulkar virodh kiya or use 18 pratishat se zyada na rakhane kii maang kii
 Amid heavy protests and protests, the Modi government made four amendments to the bill, after which the Congress agreed to it
 lekin, phir bhi rajyon ne iske khilaaf virodh ke swar jari rakhe
 However, with the passage of the bill in both the houses of Parliament and the assembly of bjp-ruled states, the bill also passed in non-bjp ruled states and is now being implemented across the country from 1 July 2017

 These things are raising many questions, the sudden blast in the gas cylinder filling the AC has also raised questions like how is the gas filled in the AC of our houses safe? dilli main chunavi ladaai ko trikoniya banane ke liye congress ne apana trump card aakhirkaar chal hi diya

 The Samajwadi Party (SP), while clarifying on the 'charm' comment of the party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, said that Yadav's saying was not meant as a physical seductress but as a politician's attraction among the masses
 yadav ne barabanki main ek samaaroh ke dauraan mahila aarakshan vidheyak kaa zikr karte hue kathith taur par kaha tha ki ‘gaanv kii mahilaon main aakarshan itnaa nahin milegaa'
 On his remarks, sp's spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary clarified that the SP chief does not say such petty things and that he did not mean physical attraction at all
 unhone kaha ki yadav ke kehane kaa matlab tha ki shahari kshetra kii mahilaon main ek rajaneta ke rup main matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke apekshaakrit kaaphi zyada gun hote hai jabaki gramin kshetra kii zyaadaatar mahilaayein anpadh hone ke kaaran matadaataaon ko vot ke liye aakarshan nahin kar paati hai
 Significantly, the SP chief had said at an event in Barabanki yesterday on the issue of Women's Reservation Bill, "if the Women's Reservation Bill was passed, the poor and village women could not get a chance
 bade-bade gharon kii ladkiyaan or mahilaayein keval upar ja sakati thim
 Remember, i am telling you about this, you do not get a chance, compared to them, the women of our village will not get so much attraction
 ’sapa pramukh ne yah baat apni us daleel par jor dene ke liye kahi thi jisamen unka kahana tha ki mahila aarakshan sambandhi vidheyak se shahari or gramin mahilaon ke bich bhed or gaharaayegaa

 The popularity of his short stories is such that five books in English — Essence of Canfer, Snake Catcher, The Occult, The Maina from Peacock Gardens and Collected Stories — exist but only one story collection in Hindi, Taus Chaman's Maina, appears
 By the way, some more of his short stories are present in Hindi
 samikshit pustak main unki saat laghu kahaniyaan hai—ganjipha, allaam or betaa, kitabadar, badenumaa, aazaariyaan, misakinon kaa ehata or bada kudaghar
 Like Taus Chaman's Maina, Ganjifa is his famous story
 isamen ek patansheel samaaj kaa khaakaa he jiskaa shandaar ateet utana hi jhootha or avishwasaneey lagata he jitna sach uskaa vartmaan he
 The beginning of the story is told about Ganjifa and his rule: "the person who plays Aftab (mir) in the day starts the game, and Aftab's jilu has a low price, rather unripe leaf, night
 At the time, the Huktab of the Mahtab get to the Mahtab and the status of the Aftab remains a minor Mir

 He also wanted to send him to Vilayat to teach him; In this context, he sold two of his houses, took a loan from office, due to which he did not get pension even after retirement

 That is, even after the aftab (sun) is cast, life continues in the low light of the month (moon)

 Similarly, the story of "allam and Son" tells the nature of ordinary people, who feel that their memory is getting weaker with time

 Like his other stories, it remains a mystery till the end and because of this, curiosity among the readers

 Hardik Pandya's all-rounder against West Indies in Manchester on Thursday helped Team India in a big way
 pehle to ballebaaji karte hue unhone 38 gendon main 46 ran banaae or iske baad carabian salaami ballebaaj sunil ambris (31 ran) kaa wicket bhi chatakaaya
 But former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq is not much impressed with Pandya's performance
 unhen pandya ke khel main kaaphi kami najar ai

 apane samaaj ko yah baat samajhane main kuch aadhunik muslim yuva na keval safal rahe hai balki unhone ek aisi shuruyaat kii he, jo is samaaj ke liye bilkul nai he
 Two years ago, on April 12, 2012, the Creative Social Foundation, a group of youth from Ujjain, organized the first introduction conference of Muslim society
 lekin tab unhen bhi andaja nahin tha ki yah aayojan aane vaale samay main itnaa bada rup le legaa or us khamosh kranti kii aguai karegaa jo dhire-dhire hi sahi, lekin samaaj main badlaav laaegi
 Muslim society is generally considered to be a puritan and a conservative
 yahi vajah he ki jahaan anya samaajon main parichay sammelan jaise aayojan aam baat hai, vahiin muslim samaaj ke liye yah ekadam nai soch he
 Public introduction of marriageable young men and women from across the country to the conference and in the desire for a better option, to tell about themselves on the stage, about their educational qualifications, is a new beginning
 isiilie jab samaaj ke kuch sushikshit logon ne nickshulk parichay sammelan kii yojana banaai to samaaj main khaasaa virodh hua
 To the extent that mosques were proclaimed against it
 lekin yah badlaav kii chaah hi thi jiske chalate beete 6 april, 2014 ko hue is kaarykram main deshbhar ke 12 rajyon se 1,400 se adhik yuvak-yuvatiyon or unke abhibhavakon ne shirkat kii
 Sarfaraz Qureshi, the founding member of the foundation, says, "around 450 biodata came in the first year, but in the second year their number increased to more than 650
 is saal to kaarykram ke ek hafte pehle hi 1,000 registration ho chuke the
 Even on the day of the event, more than 400 registrations were done on the spot
 ’’ jaahir he, samaaj ke logon ne is pahal ko saraahaa or samarthan bhi diya
 Amanatullah Kazi, a parent from Sitamau in Mandsaur district, says, "the scope of education in society is expanding
 isliye is nae plateform kii jarurat thi
 And then society also wants to get out of the realm of blood relations
 puri jindagi to usee main rahe hai
 a better alternative is now being sought
 ’’ ujjain ke naeem khan kehete hai, ‘‘jeevanasathi talashne main mahatvapurn yah dekhnaa he ki maansik str mil rahaa he yaa nahin
 The youth of the society are now more educated, hence the need for such a conference was felt
 ’’sammelan main aane vaale yuvaaon kii shaikshanik yogyata kaa akalan karne se saaf hota he ki samaaj main shiksha kaa vistaar hua he
 For example, of the 450 youth in 2012, about 30 percent were in high school or less, while undergraduates and postgraduates were 50 to 55 percent
 shiksha kaa kollam khaali chhodie waalon kii sankhya bhi acchhee-khaasi thi
 The number of those receiving vocational education was quite small
 lekin 2013 main paanch rajyon se aae 650 yuvaaon main 20 fisadi hyskool yaa kam shaikshanik yogyata vaale the, jabaki snaatak yaa adhik shikshit kii hissedari 70 fisadi tak pahunch gai
 It should be said that the number of high school educated out of 1,400 in 2014 was only 10 per cent whereas the number of undergraduate and postgraduate youth reached 90 per cent
 inamen sie, emb, emsie, emai, emtek, bidies or embibies bhi the
 Sarfaraz, giving another reason behind this conference, says, "like all societies, the level of education in girls is high in Muslim society too
 unke liye samaan shiksha praapt yuvakon kii uplabdhta ek samasya he
 Hence some elders oppose the education of girls
 sammelan kii yojana aisi yuvatiyon ko behatar vikalp uplabdh karaane kaa prayaas he jisase unki shiksha prapti main koi kaaran baadha banakar saamne na aae
 Seeing the educational qualifications of the girls coming to the event, their point is proved right

 shaadaab ahamed siddiki samaaj ke sakaaratmak rukh kaa anya kaaran bataate hai, ‘‘logon ko yah dilasa di gai thi ki isamen gaiyr-sharia kuch bhi nahin hoga
 That is why the young man and the woman are not on the same stage together
 yuvatiyon kaa pandal alag hota he jisamen registration, manch sanchaalan se lekar sabhi jimmedaari mahila swayamsevak sambhalati hai
 In fact, here the parents of young men and women worth marrying meet
 isse pataa chalata he ki samaaj rudhivaadee chole se baahar aana chahta he or sudhaar kii ore baduya chahta he
 Shahid Siddiqui, former MP and editor of the weekly Nayi Duniya (urdu), who joined the program as the chief guest, pointed to an important point, saying: "the point is that Muslim society is now looking at matters of marriage and relationships
" Not only this, he is ready to think afresh on all the questions of life
 vah nae jamaane ke saath judsa chahta he
 Whether it is political thinking or education, the thinking of Muslim society has changed
 aaj yuvaaon main shiksha kii bhukh he
 Earlier marriages were easily done within the family but now there is no escape from trying new methods
 anya samaajon kii tarah muslim samaaj bhi ise apana rahaa he
 "these youths of Ujjain have set an example in front of the Muslim society of the country because there is no tradition of organizing such places in other places
" ab to anya rajyon se log is kaarykram ko khaas taur se dekhne aate hai
 They are astonished to see how the event has been organized in such a systematic manner
 darasal aayojan sthal par kai sthanon par digital screen lagi hoti he, jis par yuvaaon ke biodata lagaataar chalate rahete hai
 The biodata of all the applicants coming to the conference are put on the organization's website within a fortnight
 parichay sammelan main vivaah yogya yuvak-yuvatiyon ke photo or unase sambandhit jaankaree kii kitaab kaarykram main hi uplabdh kara di jaati he
 The special thing is that all this is being done free of cost
 yahaan tak ki registration shulk bhi nahin liya jaataa
 The organization members bear all the expenses of the program together

 Says Ishrat Ali, "the youth of the society have been educated more than before, the awareness among the people has also increased
 desh ke prati, samaaj ke prati jimmedaari nibhaate hue yuva apana paisa or samay lagaakar is tarah kaa aayojan kar rahe hai yah acchhee baat he
 "siddiqui says," The wave of change is not only in Ujjain, but in the Muslim society across the country
 bangaluru ke bahari chor par teaminds ke mukhyalay main rahul narayan ek kritrim chand ke bhudrishy ke kinare ek oonche chabutare par baithe hue hai
 Next to them is a replica of Moon Rover
 yah puraa aluminium se bana chaar pahiyon kaa robot he jo unki team ne banaaya he or jo antim pareekshanon ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 If all goes well, the rover will be left on the lunar surface by December 2017 and will send high-definition photos and videos of its closest astronomical companion to Earth, covering a distance of 500 meters
 agar yah kaamyaab ho jaataa he to teaminds antariksh main itihaas rach degi or ek antariksh yaan banane or chand par utaarne vaali hi nahin balki chand kii sataha par rover ko chalaane vaali bhi duniya kii pehali nijee company ban jaaegi
 teamindus has named the rover ECA, an abbreviation consisting of the first letters of "A Little Hope"
 par yah udhyam antariksh ko khangaalane ke udhyam main aage kii bahut oonchi chalaang he
 teamindus, representing India, is one of the five companies in the world that were selected to compete in the largest-ever private space competition this January - the Google Lunar x Prize
 mukaable ke liye chuni gai anya chaar timen hai—moon express (america), spaicel (israel), hakuto (japan) or sinerjee moon (ek antarrashtriya consorcium yaa sangh)
 Started in 2007, the event was sponsored by Google and designed to help engineers, entrepreneurs and innovators around the world find cheap and low-cost ways to explore space from robots through privately funded teams
 To be challenged to develop
 inaam jeetne ke liye tiimon ko chand par kamyaabi ke saath ek yaan utaarna hoga, uski sataha par use 500 meter kii duuri tay karwaani hogi or uski khinchi hui tasviren or video waapas dharti par mangavane honge
 Teams must also prove that 50 per cent of their mission costs were raised from private sources
 shuruaati mukaable main 32 tiimon ne pratispardhaa kii thi, jinamein se baad main ghatakar 16 rah gayi or aakhir main kul paanch timen bachiin
 The first team to complete the mission with success received $ 2 million (rs 120 crore)
 ) kaa inaam milegaa or duusare number par aane vaali team ko 50 lakh dollar (30 karod ru
 ) Will be rewarded
 inaam kii rakam khaasi badi lag sakati he
 But the reality is that it will be able to recover only one-fourth of the cost of any winning team
 (teaminds kaa hisaab-kitaab kahata he ki uske chand mishan par 450 karod rupye kii laagat aegi)
 However, the honor and pride of winning this prize or just reaching the final will be equivalent to winning the Olympic medal
 kyonki abhi haal hi tak antariksh ke anveshan kaam isamen lagane vaali baari-bharkam laagat or technology kii jatiltaaon ko dekhte hue keval sarkari agenciyon or sansthaaon tak mahadood the
 However, over the years, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and also the European Space Agency (ESA), involved private enterprises in the work of launch vehicles and satellites
 magar yah abhi hi hua he ki antariksh praudyogiki sarkari puunji or niyantran kii bedicaon or varchasv ko todakar sachmuch aaazaad ho rahi he
 Its boldest example is billionaire entrepreneur Alan Misk, who founded Space x in 2002 and in a short span of time built durable spacecraft that can compete with the best of spacecraft
 spes eks ne haal hi main apane pehle charan ke bhimkaay prakshepan yaan ko kamyaabi ke saath waapas laakar or khadaa land karwaakar duniya ko mantrmugdh kar diya tha or is tarah dobaaraa istemaal kiye ja sakane vaale rocket kii vyaavhaarik or laagat bachaane vaali sambhaavna ke daravaaje khol die the
 It relaunched one of them with success last month
 yahi vajah he ki chand kii maujuuda daud kii ahmiyat bad gai he
 This is another example of how the upheavals of space technology are shaking up, which could usher in an entirely new and exciting era for space exploration and exploration
 teaminds ke rahul narayan kehete hai, ''ham maanate hai ki aane vaale kal ke samaadhaan tabhi milenge jab ham ateet kii rudhipoon ko todakar baahar niklenge, saath milakar jo he us par sawaal khadey karenge tathaa joshokhrosh or tajurbe ko nae, prerak tareeke se jodenge
 "narayan compares teamindus' efforts to the India that was struggling to win its first World Cup in 1983
 bhartiya team ko daud main chipa rustam isliye samajha jaataa he kyonki daud ke elaan ke teen saal baad 2010 main lunar eks price ke liye apana naam likhavane vaali yah aakhri team thi
 In addition to the late start, teamindus is now competing with some of the best space technology research teams in the world
 yah ek jabardast safar rahaa he
 Before forming teamindus, Narayan had so much experience in space that he loved Star Trek
 us vakt yah akelaa science fiction serial tha jise vah 1980 ke dashak main dilli main apane bade hone ke dinon main doordarshan par dekh pate the
 After graduating from IIT Delhi in 1995, Narayan formed a software company and ran for years, but now with humility, he says, "there is nothing really special about him
" "2010 main, 35 saal kii umr main rahul rosemara kii aam chizon ko lekar adheer ho uthe or is baat ko lekar baichaiyn hone lage ki kisi chunauteepurn kaam kaa bidaa uthaane kaa vakt niklaa ja rahaa he
 In the same day, he accidentally got an article about Lunar x Price
 unhen hairaani hui ki chand kii is daud main koi bhi hindustani team muqabla kyon nahin kar rahi he
 He was greatly inspired by the 2008 lunar mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
 isro ne apana chandrayan kamyaabi ke saath launch kiya tha or chandramaa kii sataha par moon impact prob bhi krash-land karavaaya tha
 This was the first historic success for India
 yah kamyaabi hasil karne vaala isro duniya kii paanchavin antariksh agency ban gaya tha
 Narayan spoke to some of his friends and thought that they could build spacecraft in their garages during the last two days of the week
 unhone jod-jadkar 50,000 dollar (35 lakh rupye) ikattha kiye or aakhri din apana aavedan bhej diya
 Soon Narayan realized how far he had put his hand in a seemingly impossible mission — not just in terms of technology but also in terms of building a team and raising money for such an expensive venture
 to bhi unhone yah jaankaree hasil karne ke liye ki is kism kaa databes kaise banaaya ja saktaa he, google kii khaak chaanana shuru kiya or jaankaron se bhi baat kii
 By 2012, they had formed a core team and had a rough outline of their mission to the moon
 ve kehete hai, ''tab tak yah saaf ho gaya ki ab yah mahaj shaukia udhyam nahin ho saktaa he
 "he was then advised to be the former chairman of ISRO for his project and later a member of the Planning Commission, Drs
 ke
 Take help of Kasturirangan
 isro main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kasturirangan ne chautarafa virodh ke baavjood bharat ke pehle chandra abhiyaan kii pariklpana kii thi or chandrayan ke project ko manjuur karavaaya tha
 Meeting with him proved to be the turning point
 shuruyaat main teaminds kii baat sunne ke liye kasturirangan ne aadhe ghante kaa vakt nikaala tha
 But the meeting lasted for more than three hours and Kasturirangan finally agreed to be the team's guide
 unhone kaha ki aisa koi tarika nahin he ki dilli main rahakar is project kaa kiya ja sake
 He had to move to Bangalore, where ISRO is headquartered, so that he could take advantage of the vast infrastructure of space technology, including manufacturers and vendors, who had been working hard for years
 unhone unhen salaah di ki isro se baat karo or fouran unka prakshepan yaan yani vistaarit polar satellite launch whical, pieselvi-exel, book kar lo
 This was used to send Chandrayaan into space
 unhone unase yah bhi kaha ki is ilaake main jaankaron se milo or chandrayan tathaa duusare usase jude project main kaam kar chuke isro ke ritair vaigyanikon ko apane saath le lo
 And most importantly, he told them that they would not be able to complete this mission, and if they wanted to complete the work on time, they would have to form a team of at least one hundred people
 yah poochne par ki unhone teaminds kii madad kyon kii, kasturirangan kehete hai, ''hamen us cheez kii bahut jarurat he jise bharat kii aatma kaha jaataa he, jo romaanch kaa jajba he
 In my opinion, these boys were symbols of that India — they were willing and willing to leave their best jobs and careers and jump into unconscious darkness — it requires real wisdom and courage
 apni puri jindagi sarkari vyavastha se guzarane ke baad main maanata tha ki ab vakt aa gaya he jab is desh main kai vidhaon or kai kshetron main is kism ke tajurbe kiye jaaen
 For example, in space itself, where until now we have only had a model funded by government funds
 lekin jyon-jyon ham niveshon main, rajasav main or prayogon main bad rahe hai, hamaare paas chunane ke liye vaikalpik tareeke hone hi chahie
 Entrepreneurship and initiative and new ways of solving the mysteries of space need to be devised
 "ve aage yah bhi kehete hai, ''vikram sarabhai (bhartiya antariksh ke pita) ne kaha tha ki pichhadepan kii haalat se atyaadhuniktaa kii sthiti main jabardast chalaang lagane ke liye hamen antariksh praudyogiki hasil karne kii jarurat he
 i believe that teamindus' effort will be the second tremendous leap we make in the more uprooted ways of thinking and finding solutions to traditional methods
 "iske fouran baad 2014 main narayan ne apni software company ko chhodie kaa faisla kiya or teaminds ke sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye apane vafaadaaron ke chote-se jhund ke saath bangaluru chale gaye
 It was a benign move as they got everyone's help there

 Kiran Kumar, president of ISRO, says, "we believe that we need to use every opportunity to explore the frontiers of space and teamindus' effort is a very good development
 "neshnal arospes laboratories (eneel) ne unhen istemaal ke liye apana guestaouse de diya or kuch zyada atyaadhunik test karne kii peshkash kar di

 nandan nilekani or ratan tata sareekhe udyog jagat ke aguaaon ne teaminds kii koshishon kii vittiya madad karne kaa faisla kiya
 Nilekani says teamindus reminds him of the ways of setting up Infosys, "we were just a few youngsters
" hamaare paas paisa nahin tha par bahut-se idia the or lanbaa khel khilne kii kshamta thi
 "so, when teamindus met him for financial support, he willingly agreed to charge some of the cost (although he did not want to reveal how much)
 aadhaar kii neenv rakhane vaale nilekani kehete hai, ''jab hindustani diler or dussahsee lakshyon kaa peechha karte hai to mujhe sachmuch acha lagata he
 The fact that a bunch of young people are planning to land a rover on the moon without any financial support and only on the basis of their talent and passion — which historically was done by big governments — is my idea
 yah navachaar kaa ek visphot paidaa karne kii tarah tha or mujhe laga ki yah itnaa mahaan idia he ki isko sahaara dena chahie
 "he was also helped in deciding that among the founding members of teamindus, Dr
 vivek raghavan bhi the, jinhone nilekani kii aguai main aadhaar pariyojna main kaam kiya tha or jinhen ve is kaarykram ke stambhon main se ek maanate hai
 Today, teamindus has a roof with a neon sign at the top end saying "moonshot of every Indian"
 isane sau se zyada logon ko bhartee kiya he jinamein zyaadaatar ejeeniyar or software profeshnal hai jinaki ausat umr 26 saal he
 Sheelika Ravi Shankar, who quit the management consultant's highly lucrative job in Mumbai to join teamindus, considered the Star Wars variety for each employee's position
 to yahaan jedi, ninja or skiwakar hai
 Senior leaders including Ravi Shankar have been given JD Masters designations

 He has more than a dozen ISRO retired scientists who have worked in similar missions to bring together Joshokharosh and Tjurbe

 ve yah dekhakar bhi hairaan hue ki chandra mishan shuru karne ke behtareen hardware se lekar saftware tak bazaar main uplabdh hai, basharte keemat adaa kii jaae
 He remembers that in ISRO, those people had to struggle to search and raise everything for Chandrayaan because things were not available then due to various reasons

 Finally, it was decided to take off on four legs
 isse antariksh yaan kuch baari to ho jaataa he magar usase maamla zyada sthaayee banataa he
 teamindus agreed to take the Japanese opponent's rover on the spacecraft as part of a bold decision
 isse laagat ke maamle main kuch bachat ho gai
 When the two rovers descend on the moon, it will be interesting to see who starts sending videos and photos to Earth, covering a distance of 500 meters

 The reason is that because of the relatively low gravity of the moon, heavy space vehicles can be sent for distant travel, which is not possible to launch from Earth
 antariksh main har kilo vajan le jane kaa kharch karodon kaa aata he
 Efforts are on to reduce this cost and maximize the use of spacecraft

 ajinkya rahane, manish pandey or ambati rayudu jaise khilaadiyon kii rigerv main maujuudagi hamaari bench strenth ko darshaati he
 The chief selector praised Jadhav for his aggressive batting and called him the new finisher of the team

 The ball was spinning where his team had lost 6 wickets for 40 runs, where Jadhav scored 80 runs to give his team victory

 Saha, however, scored an unbeaten 203 while playing one of the best innings in Iranian Trophy history, helping the rest of India reach the target of nearly 400 runs today
 prasad ne kaha, ‘main sirf itnaa kah saktaa hum ki saaha chot ke kaaran team se baahar tha or isliye nahin ki vah kharaab form main he

 Virat loves to chase runs while Kedar enjoys finishing the match

 (read, Wriddhiman Saha said, i do not compete with Parthiv, who did well he will play in the team) Comments is dauraan prasad ne yah bhi sanket die ki riddhimaan saaha hi test maichon main team kii bataur wicketiper ballebaaz pehali pasand honge
 Since Saha was dropped from the team due to injury, the Irani Trophy match was not to test his performance but to test his fitness
 prasad ne kaha, ‘hamane spasht kar diya he ki chot se vaapasi karne vaale khilaadi ko gharelu match main khelnaa hoga or yah uske liye sarvshereshth mauka tha
 We currently have the best number one and two wicketkeepers in the Test as Saha and Parthiv Patel
 fitness parakhane ke liye hi hamane saaha ko yahaan khilaayaa
 It is worth mentioning that Parthiv Patel made a good comeback in the Test, scoring two half-centuries while also scoring a century against Mumbai to give Gujarat the Ranji Trophy title
 saaha ne haalanki irani trophy itihaas kii sarvshereshth pariyon main se ek khelte hue naabad 203 ran banaae jisase shesh bharat ne aaj lagbhag 400 ran ke lakshya ko hasil kiya
 Prasad said, 'all i can say is that Saha was out of the team due to injury and not because he is in poor form
 vah (saaha) newjiland ke khilaaf kolkata test main main of da match tha or usne westeindies main shatak banaaya tha
 'parthiv's wicketkeeping has definitely improved
 lekin saaha kii wicketcaping behatar hai or vah parthiv se adhik ank hasil karata he
 There is healthy competition between the two

 BSP leader Satish Mishra, speaking on behalf of the party on the Lokpal bill, said that there will be a strong Lokpal, not a strong one
 bill par charchaa ke dauraan rajyasabha main bijepi ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar ek kamjor lokapal bill laai he, or sarkaar lokapal kii 'garbh' main hi hatya kar dena chaahati he
 Jaitley said that this bill should be passed with amendments, and the House should not rise without passing it
 sutron ke anusaar trinmul ne saaf kah diya he ki lokapal bill main lokayukta ke mudde par koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 At the same time, the government says that it is fully trusting the Trinamool and in the Rajya Sabha it is expected to vote in its favor from the Trinamool
 iske saath hi samaajawaadee party ne bhi kaha he ki vah lokapal bill main saat sanshodhano ke saath rajyasabha main aegi

 In his speech, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav questioned the working style of CM Akhilesh, he said
 netaji kii kahi har baat par akhilesh kabhi muskuraae, to gambhir hue, lekin mulaayam singh ke ek bayaan ke baad to akhilesh apana aapa kho baithe
 While speaking, Mulayam Singh said that a letter has come to me from the Muslims, in which it is written that your son is trying to distance the Muslims from the party and this statement became the cause of the whole ruckus
 jab mulaayam kii baat par bhadke akhileshmulaayam ke aisa kehete hi naaraaz akhilesh khadey hokar teji semulaayam singhke paas aae or kaha, 'netaji wo chitthee mujhe dikhaa dijie
 'mulayam Singh was very angry at this and said to Akhilesh,' Don't talk to me like this, go sit
 ' is par uttejit hokar akhilesh khat dikhaane kii baat kehete rahe
 Akhilesh did not stop here and said, 'this may be a conspiracy against me, in the newspaper i was written by Aurangzeb and you Shah Jahan
 'akhilesh ne amar singh par lagaaya sajeesh kaa aarozkhilesh ne gusse main cheekhte hue emelsi aashu maalik ko bulaane ke liye kaha, jo manch par maujuud the, lekin dar rahe the
 Mulayam Singh hinted to come in front, then Ashu came forward
 akhileshaashu maalikki taraf gusse se bharkar aage bade, lekin manch par sthiti kharaab hote dekh suraksha balon ne akhilesh ko gher liya
 Then some of the activists present on the stage started shoving along with Ashu Malik
 akhilesh phir chikhe, 'isane hi amar singh ke saath milakar khabar chhapavai, amar singh sajeesh kar rahe hai
 When Shivpal Yadav snatched the mic from Akhilesh Yadav amidst the snarling between the uncle and nephew on the stage and said that the Chief Minister is lying
 is par akhilesh yadav ne mike chhinane kii koshish kii, mike kii chhina-jhapati main shivpal yadav or akhilesh ke bich haath kii kohni se dhakka-mukki hui
 Mulayam Singh was watching all this, Shivpal and Mulayam Singh's security on the stage separated the two by intervening
 aashu maalik netaji kii suraksha ke bich gaadi main baith karbadi mushkilse nikal gaye
 Wherever the workers were getting the opportunity, they were cleaning their hands on the master
 gusse main manch chhodkar nikle netaji or akhileshmahaul behad garm ho gaya tha, ab netaji gusse se manch se uth kar chal die
 There was a stampede-like situation on the stage
 ek samay aisa aayaa ki shivpal or akhilesh kii security bhi aapas main aakraamak hoti dikhi
 Netaji got off the stage and sat in the car and walked towards his house
 naaraaz akhilesh kaa cheharaa bhi gusse se tamtamaa rahaa tha
 Akhilesh too sat in his car and set out towards his house
 vahaan se nikalakar akhilesh mulaayam ke peeche-peeche unke ghar panhuche or baad main shivpal yadav bhi mulaayam ke ghar gaye
 At the moment, there is a ruckus between the two and the hope of a reconciliation is also meaningless

 It is called Navroz
 parsi samudaay ke logon main navroj ko lekar kaaphi utsaah rahata he
 On this day, people wear new clothes and delicious dishes are made in their homes
 parsi samudaay ke navvarsh ko navroj ke alaava pateti or jamshedi navroj ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Jamshedi Navroz is because his warrior Jamshed was the first to reveal the people to the annual calendar
 gregorian calendar ke anusaar, pateti yaa navroj vasant ritu main us din manaaya jaataa he, jab din or raat baraabar hote hai
 Know who are Lingayats, why they want to be separated from Hinduism? Like Hinduism, people of Parsi religion also worship Agni
 ye log agni ko pavitra maanakar usamen aahuti bhi dete hai
 Parsis wear new clothes on this day and go to their place of worship (fire temple) and pray
 iske baad log ek duusare ko nae saal kii badhai dete hai or ek duusare ko ghar par khaane ke liye aamantrit karte hai

 i pray that everyone’s dreams and aspirations are fulfilled

 vah daur tha desh kii rajdhani dilli kii siyasat main badlaav kaa
 The Ram Temple was in full swing in the last decade of the 20th century
 isi dauraan saal 1993 main dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav hue
 BJP defeated the seat of Delhi state by defeating Congress
 congress is haar se ubar bhi nahin pai thi ki santhnik chunaav ke baad gutbaji, 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi maat khaakar congress or bikharati chali gai
 Assembly elections were to be held in 1998, and the scattered Congress had no leader who could give strength to the organization
 aise halaat main tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne party kii pradesh ikai kii kaman ek aise chehre ko di, jo dilli kaa nahin tha lekin dilli se anjaan bhi nahin tha
 Born in Punjab and started the political journey from Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in the country
 jab dil kii baat kehane ke liye shila dikshit ne kiya ek ghante DTC bas kaa safartab kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki yahi cheharaa dilli congress kaa paryaay ban jayega
 The power will be frozen in such a way that the opposition will have to wait for not one, but many elections, to uproot it
 yahaan ham baat kar rahe hai ek nahin, do baar nahin, balki teen baar dilli kii mukhyamantri raheen punjab kii beti or uttar pradesh kii bahu shila dikshit kii
 When Tewarshila Dixit of the Congress changed as soon as she took command, assembly elections were to be held only a few months later

 As soon as he took command, the attitude of the Congress changed

 On the issue of unbridled rising price of onion also struggled down the road
 shila kaa sangharsh rang laayaa or pyaaj kii keemton ke mudde ne tab rashtriya swaroop le liya
 Born in Punjab, studied from Delhi, it was the life of 'sheila Dixit of up's daughter-in-law', Sushma Swaraj's struggle for power brought color and the Congress defeated the ruling BJP
 tatkaaleen mukhyamantri sushamaa swaraj swayan kii seat jeetne main to safal raheen, lekin bhaajapa mahaj 15 seat par simat gai
 The Congress formed the government in the state by winning 52 assembly seats and Sheila Dikshit, the architect of this victory, became the Chief Minister
 aadhunik dilli kii shilpkaar thim shila dikshit, badal di thi rajdhani kii tasvirdilli kii siyasat main ain or chaa gayisan 1998 main dilli kii siyasat main pair rakhane vaali shila dikshit ain or chaa gayi
 Under the leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he also worked in coordination with the opposition BJP central government and wrote a new chapter of development in Delhi
 dilli waalon kaa dil aisa jeeta, ki 1998 kii jeet kaa kaaravaan 2003 or 2008 main bhi chalata rahaa
 Sheila Dixit's relationship with Delhi, who held the record for the longest female chief minister in the country by becoming chief minister three times, started with the president, did not break her life from Delhi
 dilli main apane siyaasi safar kaa aagaaj unhone jis pradesh congress adhyaksh ke pad se kii thi, usee pradesh congress adhyaksh ke pad par rahete hue dilli ke hi aspataal main shila dikshit ne antim saans lee

 isi bhaavana ne 1947 main aazaadee ke baad se desh ko ekajute banaae rakhaa he
 He alleged that relations between the southern states and the federal government have 'steadily deteriorated' due to several matters such as the threat to the economic security of the south and the future of its political representation in the bjp-led central government

 Asked whether Rahul Gandhi, standing from Wayanad, wants to give a message of support to the people of South India, has it reached the people properly, Tharoor said, 'I think it certainly has happened and this Due to the decision, there is a clear enthusiasm in the southern states that the next Prime Minister may be an elected candidate from their region

 com / zgrfxniuwf Significantly, Doval played a big role in national security as well as in the extradition of many big accused
 bataaya jaataa he kiagasta westland helicopter (agustawestland)saudebaaji maamle ke bichauliyechrishchiyan mishael (christian Michel)ko agar bharat laayaa ja sakaa tha to iske peeche rashtriya suraksha salaahkarjit dobhaal (ajit Doval)or unki team kii mehnat thi
 Actually, Doval and his team had been in touch with the UAE government for a long time
 haalanki in sab ke baad bhi mishael (christian Michel) ko bharat lekar aana ek mushkil bharaa kaam tha
 One of the main reasons for this was that Michele was a UK citizen
 aise main unka kisi duusare desh sepratrpan (christian Michel Extradition)karana bharat ke liye ek chunauti kii tarah tha
 According to information received by NDTV, Ajit Doval (ajit Doval) had formed a crack team for Mitchell's extradition about a year ago
 is team main sibiai (CBI) ke joint diarector sai manohar kul chaar sadsy shaamil the
 Apart from CBI, RAW officials were also included in this team
 bataa den ki aisa mana jaataa he ki 2016 main pakistan adhikrut kashmir par bharat dwaara kii gai sargical strike ke peeche bhi ajit dobhaal kii hi yojana thi
 For the team, it was difficult when Mitchell's lawyer strongly asserted his position in the Dubai court that Mitchell was a British citizen and could not be extradited to India from a third country
 lekin pichley saal sitambar main court ne mishael ke sabhi daavon ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from Ajit Doval, the Ministry of External Affairs also played an important role in this extradition
 enditivi ko sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar bharat sarkaar ko mishael ke pratyrpan kii jaankaree pichley saptaah hi de di gai thi
 India already knew that it would be brought to India on 4 December
 pratyrpan ko lekar dubai kii court ne 19 november ko aadesh jari kar diya tha lekin puraa maamla yuai sarkaar kii manjuuri ko lekar rukaa tha
 And it was here that India got the benefit of the strong relationship between India and UAE in the last year and a half
 mishael ke pratyrpan ke liye bharat sarkaar ne yuai sarkaar par dawaab daalaa
 Three months before the extradition, Indian agencies informed Dubai how Mitchell was preparing to flee and could deceive the agencies by wearing a Xl cap and salwar kameez
 is puure maamle main sushamaa swaraj kaa yuai daura bhi ek ahm kadi kii tarah tha
 Although the court had already approved the extradition, but after diplomatic pressure, this work was done quickly
 bataa den ki agasta westland viviipi helicopter deal maamle main bharat kii jaanch agenciyon ko badi kamyaabi mili thi
 After the court order, Christian Mitchell, the middleman of the case, was brought to India from Dubai on a private plane late at night
 der raat usase CBI mukhyalay main poochtacha bhi kii gai
 After this, he was presented in the special court of the Patiala House Court (CBI Special Court), from where he was sent to CBI custody for 5 days
 sibiai ne court se 14 din kii hiraasat maangi thi, lekin court ne sirf 5 din kii hiraasat kii manjuuri di

 somvaar kii subah der se uthne ko agar aalas samaj baithe hai, to ye galatfahami he
 To be honest, it is an insult to all slackers, being lazy is not as easy as it is understood
 paanchon indriyon ko synchronise rakhana padataa he, kahin aadhi raat gusal jane kii zarurat aan pade to use bhi tham len, sote-sote peeth bhi akad jaae to kaise lete-lete shwaan gulati lete hue peeth kii nasen chatka phir so saken
 To be lazy one has to make oneself worthy by mind-speech-deeds
 varna kya ho agar kisi roj koi kaam sahi vaqt par karne kaa man kar jaae yaa raat ke do baje kisi mitra ko railway stesan se uthaane kaa vachan de baithen?aalsee hone kaa sabase bada phayda ye hota he ki aglaa ummiden rakhana chhod detaa he or aalsee vyakti ummiido par khara na utarane kii aatmaglani se batch jaataa he
 Doesn't it seem nice that the family members shout and ask them to grind the wheat and find excuses? The lazy never runs after the brand, so it does not promote capitalism either, lazy in contrast
 nai tii-shart ko ganda hone par ulat kar pahan lete hai, ulti taraf bhi gandi ho jaae to phir sidhi kar lete hai
 They are not able to stop themselves from donning a new T-shirt in exchange for an old Dhuli Bushshirt
 yahi to daan kii sahajavritti he
 Slackers are often considered timid and disrespectful, while the opposite happens, the lazy person has become so brave as to slacken the laziness that the water takes a bath in the laziness of the heat, the short path which is deserted Even during the day, an ordinary person starts looking at his armpits
 vahaan aalas raksha ko aatur raat main bhi maje-maje nikal jaataa he, aalas kaa mahatamya sirf aalsee samaj saktaa he or isi aalas aradhana main leen hokar bade-bade avishkaar kar jaataa he
 There is a camera, a watch, a mobile, a flashlight, a calculator
 If a lazy person does not bother to handle five things, then why would a mobile have a camera, clock, flashlight and calculator? It has also increased, in a big party, instead of spending a lifetime, joining the small party by giving a donation of ten rupees to a small party and leaving it behind, the increasing custom of parachute entry in the big party is also a result of this

 He instilled a sense of patriotism among the youth and became a messenger of independence
 19 disambar 1927 ko ashfaq ulla khan ko british shaskaon ne faijabad jail main faansee de di
 His sacrifice remains an inspiration for the youth even today

 The British told them that if Hindustan becomes independent, Hindus will rule it and Muslims will get nothing
 is par ashfak kaa jawaab tha ki foot daalo shashan karo kii niti kaa ab hindustaniyon par koi asar nahin padegaa or hindustan aaazaad hokar rahegaa
 According to historians, the British also lured Ashfaq that he would be released if he became a government witness against Ramprasad Bismil and his other comrades
 lekin ashfak ke iraade atal rahe or unhone sarkari gavaah banane se inkaar kar diya

 Analysts say that the main contender Enrique Peña Neoto seems to be losing ground due to student protests
 chaatro ke virodh pradarshnon ke chalate pena niyoto kaa prachaar abhiyaan pichley do saptaah main kuch kamajor pad gaya he
 The protesting students claim that the victory of Neoto's Institutional Revolutionary Party will bring dictatorship to Mexico again
 is party kaa pichley 71 saal se raashtrapati pad par kabja he
 Lopez Oberodor said, 'pena Neoto's influence is waning
 ’vah purv ke surveykshanon main niyoto or maujuuda sattarudh party ke ummidavara josephina vajaquej mota se peeche tisare number par chal rahe the
 At one time, Neoto took the lead with 15 to 20 percentage points and it seemed that he would take the same position in the race for the presidency
 lekin dainik riforma dwaara jari nae surveykshan main niyoto ko keval 29 fisadi samarthan dikhaaya gaya he jabaki lopage 26 fisadi samarthan hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe hai jabaki mota ko keval 18 fisadi samarthan hasil hua he
 Describing the case as politically motivated, Khaira has also alleged in the petition that false cases have been filed against him earlier, so the current case should be canceled

 unhone kaha ki swami sansad ke andar 'sadak chhap bhashaa' kaa prayog karte hai jo ki thik nahin he
 Also, a Congress leader said that big leaders like Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad in the Rajya Sabha are not serious about the agustawestland case
 unhone kaha ki swami kaa puraa raajnneetik safar hi dishaheen rahaa he or uskaa parichay wo rajyasabha main bhi de rahe hai
 The Congress leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that under the pressure of the RSS, Swamy is giving up the matter

 '' (input bhashaa se) Manohar Lal Khattar, a name that was unknown before the 2014 Haryana Assembly elections
 aresas ke karmath kaaryakarta rahe haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne 2014 main pehali baar chunavi maidan main utre or pehali baar main hi unhone jeet kaa swaad chakh liya
 He not only won but was also elected the Chief Minister of the state

 In fact, Khattar had been very close to PM Modi

 The two then worked together for the organization on several fronts
 khatter 24 saal kii umr main hi aresas ke sampark main aa gaye the or unhone apana jivan sanghathan ke liye nyochaavar karne kaa thaan liya
 Khattar, playing cricket (photo- Facebook page), worked with Modi for a long time before becoming CM, Khattar, who was an MLA from Karnal seat in Kamhariyana, served the Sangh for nearly 34 years
 baad main bijepi se jude or haryana main party sanghathan ko majboot banane main jute gaye
 Informants say that during that time he met Narendra Modi, who was then in charge of Haryana BJP
 donon ne ek duusare ke saath lambey samay tak kaam kiya
 During this time, the two became friends
 iske baad khatter ko haryana main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle haryana chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 At the same time, Khattar was also instrumental in planning the 2014 assembly elections
 khatter punjabi samudaay se aate hai
 Khattar joined the RSS in the 70s, then became a pracharak in 1980 and decided not to marry, giving importance to public life
 bataaya to yah bhi jaataa he ki narendra modi or manohar laal khatter ne sangh main ek saath prachaarak kaa kaam kiya or is dauraan wo ek hi room main rahe
 The father of Thikanamnohar Lal Khattar, who came from Pakistan and built in Rohtak, Haryana, came from Pakistan in 1947 and settled in Bidana village in Rohtak district
 khatter kii schuli shiksha rohtak main hi hui
 His school time friend Omprakash tells that Manohar Lal Khattar was very fast in reading and writing during school time
 unki ganit kaaphi acchhee thi
 He was a student of very serious nature, so everyone called him headmaster in the school
 haalanki, 10veen paas karne ke baad wo rohtak se dilli aa gaye
 It is said that he opened a shop in Sadar Bazar, Delhi
 yahi wo samay tha jab wo aresas ke sampark main aae
 Manohar Lal Khattar was under tremendous pressure to marry from his family at a young age
 parivaar ke log chaahate the ki wo aresas chhodkar ghar basaa len
 But Khattar was not deterred by his intentions
 khatter ne dilli vishvavidhyalay se grajuation kiya
 Khattar along with Jain sage Tarun Sagar (pic- Facebook page) father wanted Khattar to become businessman, five brothers and two sisters, the eldest of the aspirations of Khattar was also ordinary
 unke bare main bataaya jaataa he ki khatter medical kii taiyaari karnaa chaahate the lekin unke pita chaahate the ki unka betaa bijness main apana samay den
 Khattar, who was looking for his life direction between the doctor and the business, came to the door of the union
 jiske baad unke jivan ke nae adhyay kii shuruyaat hui
 Charanjit Khattar, brother of Manohar Lal Khattar, says that Manohar Lal Khattar started a small canvas business but after some time he came in contact with RSS
 wo apatkaal kaa daur tha
 During that time he tried to know how the RSS works and what are its interests
 jeb main gita rakhte hai khattarkhatter bataate hai ki jab unhen aresas ke kaaryon ke bare main pataa laga to unhen yah mahasoos hua ki aresas par laga bain galat tha
 Since then, he joined the RSS
 khatter ke pahanaave ke bare main baat karen to wo zyaadaatar piem narendra modi ke jaise hi halkaa bhagava kurta or halki neeli sadri pahante hai
 The special thing is that Manohar Lal Khattar always keeps the Gita in his pocket

 'it is worth mentioning that on Friday, Mamta gave the Central Government 72 hours to withdraw the decision to hike diesel prices, limit subsidy on LPG cylinders and FDI in multi-brand retail

 On the same day in Pakistan, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry called the Deputy High Commissioner of India and complained of an attack by the Indian Army on the Pakistani outpost, in which a Pakistani soldier was killed and one was injured

 However, the Indian Army outright rejects the July 2011 incident as well as any attack on it for retaliation

 lekin agle hi pal jo hone vaala tha farida usase puri tarah anjaan thi
 When Farida's eyesight fell on the table after some time, her son was missing from the table
 farida ke hosh ud jate he
 Frightened Farida searches for Shabav here and there but does not know anything
 shabaav agava ho chukaa tha
 The police register a case of kidnapping of Shabav
 shabaav ke mata-pita apane maasoom ke photo lage ishtehaar lekar use talashne ke liye sadakon kii khaak chaanane nikal padate hai
 Ten years had passed, ten years had passed since now, but Shabaw was still lost in the eyes of his parents
 dilli kii shaayad hi koi aisi jagah ho, jo uske maa-baap ne uski talash main na dekhi ho
 The troubled parents went to all the temple-mosques, each time requesting the son's union at the rate of the above
 har roj maa-baap shabaav kii ek tasviir lekar is ummid main ghar se nikalate ki bhuule-bhatke hi sahi, kahin to unka lakhte-jigar unhen mil jaae

 unka maananaa tha ki upar vaale ke ghar der he lekin andher nahin
 Something similar happened that Shabav's parents had never even imagined
 isi saal may main farida kii ek shaadi ke album par najar padi to vah chaunk padi
 The next moment, what Farida told her husband with tears in her eyes was astonishing
 darasal us album main ek tasviir shabaav kii bhi thi
 Shabav has now become Sameer and the father immediately informed the police about this
 police us tasviir ke jariye us ghar tak pahunch gai jahaan shabaav kisi duusare naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Shabav's name was changed
 ab vah samir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 At the same time, the police wanted to confirm that Sameer is Shabav, because the child was almost 11 years old
 uski shakl or surat badal chuki thi
 The police came to know that Sameer was studying in MCD school in Seelampur
 sakhti se poochtacha main tut gaye samir ke maa-bapfarida or uske pati police ko bataa chuke the ki samir hi unka betaa shabaav he
 After which the police strictly questioned Samir's parents Nargis and Shamim in possession
 poochtacha main vah tut gaye or unhone jo khulaasa kiya use sunakar sabhi dang rah gaye
 Both the accused husband and wife were perpetrators of a crime that not only embarrassed the relationship, but kept a parent away from a piece of their soul for ten years in the desire of their happiness and children
 be-aulad the isliye kiya tha ye jurmanargis or samim apnagunahakubul kar chuke the
 He told that he has no children
 aulad kii chaah main hi unhone is gunaah ko anjaam diya tha
 Currently both have been arrested by the police
 is puure vaakye ke baad maasoom shabaav ajeeb uljhan main he
 He could not understand who he would call abbu-ammi, because those who hitherto kept him on his eyelids, fulfilled his every wish, abbu-ammi was now standing behind bars
 baharhaal farida or uske pati apane bete shabaav ko paakar behad khush hai
 Shabav will be with his real parents soon after the legal process is over

 ishrat jahaan encounter cese main bada khulaasa hua he
 The 70-minute audio tape has caused a stir in the Gujarat government
 ye audio tepe he 18 november 2011 ko ahmedabad main hui ek gopneey baithak kaa, jisamen gujarat ke grahamantri samet kai aalaa adhikari maujuud the
 It has come to light from the tape that this strategy was being prepared in this meeting how to divert the investigation of Ishrat encounter case and prevent the SIT from filing another FIR
 pehali baar jaaniye ishrat encounter cese kaa sansanikhej khulaasa
 
 
 a sensational encounter takes place on the highway near Ahmedabad on 15 June 2004
 chaar log maare jate hai
 Among those who died was Ishrat Jahan, a college student
 encounter ke baad se is par tarah-tarah ke sawaal uthe or chah saal baad gujarat hoicourt ne isaki sachai kii padtaal ke liye esaiti kaa gathan kar diya
 a top secret meeting takes place in Ahmedabad when the SIT was preparing to file its report
 bataaya jaataa he ki baithak main ye ranneeti taiyaar hui ki is cese main duusari exiaar darj hone se kaise roka jaae
 Nine people attended this meeting
 tepe kaa khulaasa hone ke baad se is baithak ke kirdaar ab sibiai jaanch ke ghere main hai
 After listening to the audio tape, it becomes clear how in November 2011 the Gujarat Home Minister himself was trying to influence the outcome of the SIT report
 tepe main gujarat ke grahamantri praphul patel bolte hai, 'main jitani madad kar saktaa tha, kii he
 In the conversation, he further says how he himself called the investigating officer and tried to influence him
 praphul patel kehete hai, 'maine ye jaanate hue bhi ki isamen itnaa khatra he, satish verma ko mere ghar par bulaayaa or unke saath 4 ghante se zyada baat kii
 i also asked them to help these 18 people and if you do this then it will be a big deal
 'grih mantri rajya kii police kaa bhi mukhiya hota he
 But in the audio tape, the same minister was seen trying to fix the way of justice, trying to fix the investigation
 lekin us roj top sikret kamare main or bhi bahut kuch hua
 Know how in the next conversation, then Advocate General Kamal Trivedi should advise Rohit Verma, the lawyer of accused GL Singhal, what is the defense strategy in the court
 trivedi kehete hai, 'humlog pichley kai ghanton se us report par charchaa kar rahe hai jo 21 ko aa sakati he
 Suppose for a moment that this report is against us
 sabase pehle to ye jaan lo ki hamen vakeelon ke jariye hi baat rakhni chahie, har vakt sarkaar nahin bol sakati
 At this time you have to raise your voice yourself
 ek salaah ye he ki hamen 3 vakil rakhane chahie
 While Nirupambhai is there, Suryaprakash Raju will see the case of Tarun Barot, while the rest of the people should see the Bharat Nayak
 'camel trivedi aage kehete hai, aaplog in teenon se sampark kar sakate hai or main bhi baat karuunga
 Suppose the report comes and the court says that seeing the report, the encounter seems fake at first sight
 jaise ye court ye kahe, iskaa virodh hona chahie, sambhavat: ham is report kaa moolyankan karnaa chahenge or iske liye hamen kuch samay chahie
 We would also like to be given a copy of this report so that whatever facts we have, we can bring it before the court
 haalanki ye court ko tay karnaa he ki kya karnaa he
 In this way we should try to take time of week or 10 days
 'ye gujarat ke tatkaaleen edwocket general hai jo aaropee pulicekarmiyon ke bachaav kii ranneetik bana rahe the
 It is worth noting here that some policemen were not under the charge of the Gujarat government
 aise main aropiyon ke bachaav kii ranneeti main gujarat ke edwocket general kyon shaamil the?70 minute kii baatcheet ke dauraan kuch maukon par tab agi or duusare logon ne cese kii sunwaayee kar rahe jajon ko lekar galat tippaniyan bhi kii
 On one occasion, AG Kamal Trivedi also made abusive remarks about the judge hearing the case
 sikret main meeting main jo log maujuud the or tepe se jo byoraa saamne aayaa, usase saaf jaahir he ki duusari exiaar or aage kii jaanch rokane ke liye edwocket general or soobe ke grih mantri kis had tak koshish kar rahe the
 The question arises why? After all, why were these big police officers and ministers trying to save the policemen accused of fake encounters? Is it just for fear that the big conspiracy will not be revealed that was created behind this fake encounter? The tape does not have that much
 tepe kii baatcheet se saamne aata he ki baithak main narendra modi ke kareebi iees afasar jisi murmu bhi maujuud the jo tab sachiv kii haisiyat se mukhyamantri karyaalay se jude the
 Even today, he is in this position
 is tepe main aap murmu kii aawaaj sun sakate hai, jo jaanch dabaane ke tareeke par vichaar vimarsh kar rahe the
 The audio recording of the meeting showed that the people present in the meeting had agreed that the SIT would declare the Ishrat Jahan encounter as fake and would mean that the policemen involved in it would face criminal cases
 phir bhi ye taqatvar rajaneta or sarkari afasar aage kii jaanch prabhavit karne kii har mumkin koshish kar rahe the
 - After all, what was the Gujarat government worried about? - Why was the entire machinery of Gujarat against the new investigation? - Is it just because further investigation can reveal more big conspiracy? - Such a conspiracy which also has big political names in its wraps Can come? It is evident from the conversation that the people present in the secret meeting wanted to send the case to the POTA court
 unki baton se lagata he ki unhen bharosa tha ki pota court main wo cese dabaane main kaamyaab ho jaaenge
 Know what Rohit Verma, lawyer of the accused police officer GL Singhal, said in that meeting
 raahit verma kehete hai, 'jis vakt wo port court main report file karenge, gend hamaare paale main hogi
 We have to take the SIT up to the POTA court somehow
 aap utana kar denge sar, baaki to kanoonee daanv pench itnaa he ki naa to pota court sangyaan le paaegi naa kuch kar paaegi
 Will continue like this, 2 years, 4 years, 5 years
 itani kanoonee jatiltaayen hai, ye cese band hona chahie bas
 'A private lawyer is working with a top Advocate General like the acting Advocate General of Gujarat government to formulate a strategy on how to transfer a case to POTA court
 lekin, itnaa hi kaaphi nahin tha
 Acting Advocate General Kamal Trivedi also told the people present at the meeting how they tried to control the functioning of the SIT
 camel trivedi kehete hai, 'maine unase kaha he, unase baat kii he, maine unhen salaah di ki ritair ho jaao
 
 
 
 
 Is Murmu right? The shameless man says that if i try to demote him, he will first reveal everything
 dekha aapane, kaise kaaryvahak edwocket general esaiti ke ek sadsy ko apane chembar main bulaate hai or unase pad chhodane ko kehete hai
 It is being discussed here of Mohan Jha, who is one of the three members of the SIT formed on the orders of Gujarat High Court
 ek baar phir is baatcheet ko suniye
 In the course of the conversation, Kamal Trivedi also named the powerful secretary of Narendra Modi, GC Murmu
 is baithak main murmu bhi maujuud the or tepe main unki aawaaj bhi he
 The audio recording proves that the Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat was also involved in trying to stop further investigation in the Ishrat Jahan case
 jab prakritik aapadaaen aati hai, to keval insaanon ke hi nahin balki devataaon ke rihaaish par bhi sankat aa jaataa he
 a similar situation occurred in Garhwal in Uttarakhand when JD of the Alaknanda River hit a mythical Hanuman temple
 lekin janmaal ke nuksaan se bachane ke liye yahaan se shift kar rahe log apane isht devtaa ko shift karnaa nahin bhuule
 It is reported that the legendary Hanuman temple, which came under the influence of Alaknanda's earthquake in Farasu, some distance away from Garhwal, was shifted before it collapsed
 ullekhneey he ki yahaan kii ek jalavidyut pariyojna baandh kii jhil main aa rahe alakananda nadi ke tej bahaav se is puranic hanuman mandir ke neeche lage pusht dhahne ke kagaar par aa gaye the
 Due to this, the temple could have been razed and cut in the fast flow of the river at any time
 tippaniyan But the local residents here after 10 hours of effort broke the temple's womb and took out the statue of Hanumanji
 vartmaan main sthaayee vyavastha hone tak vah pratimaa parasu gaanv se guzar rahe badrinaath haive ke kinare asthaayee mandir main rakhaa gaya he
 a villager said that the people here are saddened by Hanumanji's shift in this way, even in the disaster of 2013, this temple did not face such a threat that it had to shift
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki jab tak pratimaa shift nahin ho gai, tab tak mandir shifting ke kaary main lage logon kii hausala-afjai ke liye mandir parisar main shraddhalubhajan-kirthan karte rahe
 But to avoid the loss of life and property, the people shifting from here did not forget to shift to their favorite deity
 khabar he ki gadhwal se kuch dur sthit parasu main alakananda ke bhukataav kii jad main aae puranic hanuman mandir ko dhahne se pehle hi shift kar diya gaya
 It is worth mentioning that a hydroelectric project here was on the verge of collapsing under the mythical Hanuman temple due to the rapid flow of the Alaknanda River coming in the lake of the dam
 is vajah semandir kabhi bhi nadi ke tej bahaav main cat kar dharashayi ho saktaa tha
 The comments lekin yahaan ke sthaneey nivaasiyon ne 10 ghante kii mashkkat ke baad mandir ke garbhasthal ko todakar hanumanji kii pratimaa ko baahar nikaala
 At present, the statue is kept in a temporary temple on the banks of the Badrinath highway passing through Farasu village till permanent arrangements are made
 ek gramin ne bataaya ki hanumanji ke is prakaar shift hone se yahaan ke log dukhi hai,varsh 2013 kii aapadaa main bhi is mandir ko aisa khatra nahin hua ki use shift karnaa pade
 He also told that until the statue was shifted, devotees kept doing bhajan-kirtan in the temple premises to encourage people engaged in temple shifting work
 ullekhneey he ki yahaan kii ek jalavidyut pariyojna baandh kii jhil main aa rahe alakananda nadi ke tej bahaav se is puranic hanuman mandir ke neeche lage pusht dhahne ke kagaar par aa gaye the

 Now the era of the grandfather of the Internet has arrived
 uske haath main maarane ke liye chaabuk or pairon main pehanaane ke liye bediyaan hai
 The new draft of the rules of Information Technology Act 2008 is definitely going to increase the difficulties for internet service providers and its consumers
 nae niyam internet kii saamagree (content) taiyaar karne waalon, sibar cafe or vaai-fi spot se lekar upabhoktaaon tak ke liye betuke lag rahe hai
 Experts say that it will be impossible to monitor and implement them
 aise desh main jahaan internet ke 10 karod upabhokta hon or soochna praudyogiki kaa teji se vistaar ho rahaa ho, is kadam ne vyapak naaraazgi paidaa kar di he
 Intelligence reports state that the terrorist group lashkar-e-tayyiba used the Internet to plan the 26 / 11 2008 Mumbai attacks
 ghatana ke ek maheene baad, kanoon kaa nayaa masauda, kathith rup se bharat ke hiton kii raksha karne kaa hadabadi main uthaaya gaya kadam tha
 Though the intention behind the Information Technology Act was good, but it shows the scared mentality of the government
 satahi taur par lagata he ki yah kanoon nagarikon or unki niztaa kii suraksha se judaa he, lekin jis tarah pichley maheene adhisuchana jari kii gai usamen internet par niyantran rakhane kii manshaa zyada dikhaai detii he
 It seems that the government wants to show its bullying in the name of national security
 ye niyam internet par jaankaree dene vaale un vichaaron par lagaam lagane kii koshish hai jo lagata he, sarkaar ke khilaaf jate hai
 Internet users believe that while the government is preparing to equip itself with a powerful button to shut down the internet during 'national disasters', there is little scope for any relaxation
 nae niyamon kaa adhyayan karne ke baad soochna praudyogiki ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki unki chintaa is baat ko lekar he ki ye niyam spasht nahin hai
 These will give the government the power to stop the exchange of information in the name of maintaining 'public interest' or 'integrity' of India
 haal hi main mistra or libya main jan andolan ke chalate vahaan sarkarein website or soshal netwarking cites ko samay se band nahin kar pai thim

 It has also been made mandatory for all of them in the rules that if a government agency asks for information about a consumer, then they have to provide complete information about it
 yah ek aisa niyam he jo kisi tarah kaa aparaadh hone kii sthiti main seva pradaata ko is baat ke liye baadhya karegaa ki vah upabhokta ke bare main gopneey jaankaree kaa khulaasa kare
 The new rules require these representatives to stop a consumer from receiving "harm, harassing or" blasphemous "information

 According to the new rules, if any person gives internet facility to anyone from any place for normal working, then it will be considered as cyber cafe

 People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers were trying to sneak into the Indian border between 6 and 9 am in two areas, Finger Four and Finger Five, but on both occasions Indian troops failed

 At the same time, China says that it is building a road in its area and has called the intervention of the Indian Army an 'encroachment'
