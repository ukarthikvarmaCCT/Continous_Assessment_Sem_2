 Raj Thackeray has reached Pawar's stronghold
 raaj ne sidhe-sidhe pavaar kii raajnneetik samajhadaari par hi sawaal uthaa diya he
 Raj even said that Pawar's focus is on the IPL and not the election
 pune kii ek raily main raaj ke nishane par the sharad pavaar
 MNS leader Raj Thackeray first questioned Pawar's political understanding
 raaj thakare ne kaha ki pavaar ko kabhi lagata hai marathi pradhanmantri hona chahie or aaj bol rahe hai kii mahila pradhanmantri hona jaruri hai
 i do not understand Pawar's politics
 jis din muje wo samaj aegi us din main raajnneeti chhod duungaa
 Raj Thackeray had the second weapon against Pawar in the IPL
 raaj thakare ne kaha ki desh main chunaav ho rahe hai or kuch netaa match karaane main vyast hai
 Some leaders of our country are expected to organize IPL matches when elections are going on in the country
 raaj thakare ne apni chunavi raily main aatanki kasaab kaa ek rashan card dikhaate hue kehete hai ki chunaav main farji rashan card or farji voter ai card ban rahehain
 a (good) man from Indore had kept a lock on her woman's vagina for the last four years
 pareshaan stri jehar khaakar jaan dene ja rahi thi-afratfari main jab use aspataal le jaaya gaya to ilaaj ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki uski yoni taale main jakadi hui he
 If this incident does not happen, no one would know that in this 21st century, the vagina is literally locked in a lock
 chaabi patidev ke jimme
 Locks and keys were arranged so that the penis of another man could not enter her vagina
 apni jarurat ke mutabik pati hi uski yoni kaa taala kholaa karata tha
 After reading this news, i remembered that in the dark ages of Europe, there was an iron-bound virginity bandan or 'chestiti belt' tied on the girls' bodies
 dur deshaantar jane ke pehle striyon kii yoni par baari-bharkam 'chastity belt' naam kaa louh pinjar daalkar hi log baahar jate the
 Women could not open the iron cage until Swami himself came and opened the lock
 yani, yoni kii adhikarini striyaan nahin, unke maalik hai
 Regardless of how they protect their personal property
 jo purush sattatmak maansikta us andhkaar yug main striyon kii yoni par taala jadti thi, usee maansikta ke chalate indore vaasi sajjan ne stri yoni par taala lagaaya tha
 Many centuries have passed between that era and the present era, but there has been no change in that mindset
 is ghatana ko jaanane ke baad logon ne us aadmi ko bahut dutkaara, shaitan, kamina aadi kahkar gaaliyaan deen
 It is right that this incident is about to lock, but this mindset is surrounded by all around
 isi maansikta vaale log aaj kaa samaaj chalaa rahe hai
 Since the lock is visible, people have objections
 adrishy taale ke liye kisi ko koi aapatti nahin
 a woman is not just the personal property of the husband, she is the personal property of the whole society
 stri vivaah ke pehle kisi ke saath yon sampark karegi ki nahin, vivaah ke baad kiske saath kis prakaar chalegi-rahegi, raat kitni der tak baahar rahegi, kiske saath baaten karegi, kisase nahin milegi, kiske saath hansegi, ghar main koun-koun aaenge, koun nahin aaenge, kiske saath soyegi or kiske saath nahin-yah sab uskaa pati yaa parivaar hi nahin, puraa samaaj bataa detaa he, tarjani uthaakar dhamka detaa he
 Soldiers with arms in hand are deployed around the woman or are ready to throw stones, to torture Kara or to eat
 samaaj kii har ladki ke yonang par ek adrishy taala jadaa hua he
 The masculine mentality that forced women to get the 'chestiti belt' or lock, is the same mentality that has forced the invisible lock today
 taala dikhataa nahin, lekin taala he
 If this invisible lock is not on the sex of a girl of the society, then a lot of uproar will arise
 us ladki ko samaaj manyata nahin detaa, agar uske yonang par vah adrishy taala yathasthaan na laga ho
 This invisible lock is called Pitru Shakti Tantra or Purusha Shakti Tantra
 is pitru satta tantra yaa purush satta tantra ke kathghare main striyaan kaid hai
 Women are imprisoned in family and social learning, so there is no need for them to fabricate an iron cage or iron locks separately
 is purush satta tantra main purush kii bhoomika he-prabhu kii, karta kii, niamak kii or bhoga karne vaale swami kii
 The role of women is that she is the maid of men - she is a sexual object, a man who produces a child
 yahi sab uske hisse hai-kai tarah ke niyam banaakar, rang-rogan potkar
 Is there any species that is marginalized and humiliated due to its own species having different sex? aaj bhi nari ke viruddh us vishmata ko dur nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Women are still sex-slaves, even today, girls are sexually victimized, facing domestic violence, honor killing, rape, group maliciousness, female infanticide, female-feticide, acid-hunting and dowry practices
 
 dahej chukaane main asamarth hone par ghar-ghar main stri-dah, ba kii hatya-yani stri-virdohi koi nrushansata samaaj se dur nahin hui he
 Many people say that if educated, the problem of women will be diagnosed
 lekin dekha yah gaya he ki ek shikshit nari purush satta tantra kii niyamavali jitani acchhee tarah sikh sakati he, utani acchhee tarah ek anpadh stri nahin
 The ability to learn is greater among the educated
 shikshit striyon kaa vivaah hone par ve maayke se usee tarah sasuraal jaati hai, jis tarah ek anpadh or garib stri
 The educated woman bashes her surname and takes her husband's surname
 purushon ke liye hota he pita kaa sarnem, maa kaa nahin
 This means, the woman and her offspring are subject to the male husband
 stri or uski santan kaa maalik vah purush he
 According to the patriarchal rule, a girl has to live - under father in childhood, under husband after marriage and under son in old age
 shaastra main bhi isaki duhai di gai he-'na stri swatantramarhati'-nari kaa swatantraaa par koi adhikaar nahin
 The dress of women has changed - once they were forced to cover themselves from head to toe, and once they were asked to take off everything
 ve har jagah ''sexual objectification'-kii shikaar hai
 They ship cosmetics - because the world of male power system preaches them repeatedly to remain attractive in the eyes of men
 aakarshak bane rahane ke liye sharir kii maap-jokh kii hifaazat kerani he
 How much chest, waist, butt, everything is being told, black and dark colored women have been told that your colors are colorless
 inhen jitna gora karogi, utani hi aakarshak lagogi
 Chemical has become popular in the market to make the body complexion blond, eliminate skin shrinkage
 ladkiyaan ek maance-pind hai-cheharaa-seenaa or yonang ke alaava or kuch nahin
 Girls have brains, they have intelligence - it doesn't matter to anyone
 striyaan kray-vikray kii vastu hai-gins
 They are kept in the form of punishment, dazzling and so on
 purush satta tantra kaa kathor niyam he, unhen har haal main apana comaryatv bachaakar rakhana hoga
 All men want a virgin girl
 agar kisi ladki kaa kisi ke saath ek baar bhi yon sambandh ho chukaa he, is baat kii khabar fail jane par majaal he ki koi purush us ladki ke saath vivaah karne kii hami bhar de
 And after marriage he has to preserve his sattva
 yah niyam hi he nari ke yonang main zanjeer daalane yaa taala jadne kaa
 It is not only the woman's sexual organs, but also the master of her chorion
 stri or purush yah faisla karte hai ki ek stri kitni santan ko garbh main dhaaran karegi or kisi santan kaa ling kya hoga
 a woman's chorion is her own but she does not have authority over it
 purush ke yonang par koi taala jadne kii pabandi nahin he
 Husbands are open for men all over the world, a man can calm his sexual desire whenever he wants
 aisi lakhon-karodon ladakiyon ko chal-bal or kaushal se is samaaj main patita yaa yon-daasi banaakar unka bhoga kar saktaa he
 Girls have been educated and qualified
 vivaah ke bazaar main shikshit ladkiyaan oonchi keemat par bik rahi hai
 But educated or uneducated, often all youth demand dowry
 agar ham swasth or behatar samaaj chaahate hai to hamen yah yaad rakhana hoga ki us samaaj main striyon ko samaan adhikaar dena hoga
 The relationship of man and woman is not the relation of lord and maid, this relationship will depend on friendship and co-religion etc
 samaaj ke nirmaan main vishmata paidaa karne vaali vyavastha ko mitaanaa hoga
 But there are so many parents who teach their offspring that both men and women have equal rights
 purush kii deh main adhik peshiyaan hoti hai, lekin ham samaaj, athwa desh yaa parivaar ko maance peshiyon ke bal par nahin chalaate hai, ham ise buddhi se chalaate hai
 Women and men are no less than anyone in intellect
 striyon ne pramanit kiya he ki jo-jo kaam itane dinon tak purushon ke liye bataae jate the, un tamaam kaamon ko karne main ve samarth hai
 (even though men have not yet accepted that men also interfere in the work in which the woman is transparent, or the qualities that are in it, or all those qualities are also in them, such as the upbringing of children, the householder Work, cooking, cleaning the house, being sensitive, generous, soft-hearted, etc
)
 pitru satta tantra kii vyavastha purush dwaara nirmit he jo purushon ke aaraam or aish karne or prabhutv banaae rakhane ke liye kii gai he
 But this ancestral power cannot last without the help of a woman
 striyon ne is pitru satta ko tikaae rakhane main har tarah kaa sahyog kiya he
 For example, in Africa, sensitive parts of the sexual organs are cut and thrown away at a young age so that they can never experience sexual pleasure
 bahuton ke yonang ke samvedansheel hisse ko taank tak diya jaataa he
 It is customary not only in Africa, but also among the Bohra Muslims of India to cut off the part of the sexual organs
 asia ke indonesia or anya kuch deshon main bhi aisa hota he
 Rape is common, sexual slavery and prostitution have been going on ever since, women have also been helping in this heinous sexual act against women
 striyaan is pitru tantra ko tikaae rakhana chaahati hai-kaaran yah he ki unke dimag main bachapan se hi yah vishwaas bhar diya jaataa he ki purush ek badi jaat kaa manushya he or stri he ek choti jaat
 a woman is the material for a man's enjoyment
 yah jaghanya or stri virdohi kutsit mantra purush ke dimag main bhi thuns diya gaya he
 The rules of the patriarchy system have been accepted by the women with their heads bowed and they follow it from generation to generation as a labor; Women have made all the efforts and arrangements to use the woman as an object or a dishonor
 har tarah ke dharmik, saamaajik or stri-virdohi anushthanon evam anushasano kaa bade dhoomdhaam se paalan karti hai
 Not only this, educated women also share in it
 shiksha paane or swanirbhar hone kaa ek uddeshy satta tantra kaa pratwaad karnaa he, ve yah nahin samajhtin
 The share of so-called female education and self-reliance goes in favor of a man more than the private use of a woman
 purush ek shikshit stri ko saath lekar saiyr-sapata kar saktaa he, purush kii santan ek shikshit stri ke paas pal-bad sakati he, stri kii kamai kaa bada hissaa purush kii jeb main ja rahaa he
 The man is still taking all the decisions
 stri kii kamai ko kis mad main kharch karnaa he, iskaa faisla bhi akasar purush hi karata he
 a woman's earnings are like a woman's sexual organs, or like a chorion
 stri kaa yonang kis tarah upbhog kiya jayega, iskaa faisla stri nahin, purush letaa he
 Today women have got many kinds of freedom, to walk on the road, to go to school-college, to office-court, but they have not got sexual freedom yet, because this restriction is the real restriction of the woman
 purush satta tantra stri-yonang ko khuntiyon main jakadakar rakhata he
 Sexual freedom is not meant to be with anyone here ever
 iskaa matlab he apni pasand ke vyakti ke saath sona or sone ke liye har ghadi haa kehane se zyada naa kehane kii aazaadee
 Sexual freedom is not the only thing to agree to sexual contact, not to agree to sex is sexual freedom
 mul baat he yonang kii bandish, yon-paradheenata, gharelu hinsa, kanya bhrun hatya, shishu kanya hatya, dahej, ba hatya, younachaar or veshyavriti ityadi-ye rog nahin hai-ye rog ke lakshan hai
 The name of the disease is Pitru Shakti
 ham is mahamari ke lakshan dur karne main jute hai lekin mahamari ko nahin
 The symptoms will never be destroyed without removing the epidemic, no matter how much we try

 unhone kaha ki hamane shanti sthapit karne ke liye hi ramajaan maheene main sijafire lagu kiya tha, lekin usamen bhi shanti sthapit nahin ho pai
 Things were getting worse
 kashmir main rahaa centre kaa puraa sahyogbijepi netaa ne press conference main kaha ki suraksha ke liye centre sarkaar ne puraa sahyog kiya he
 The Home Minister constantly visited the valley, trying to negotiate with everyone
 unhone kaha ki hamane pakistan ko seemaa paar se gatividhiyon karne par roak lagaai, 4 hajaar bunker banaae gaye the
 He said that even though we were in government, the main leadership was in the hands of PDP
 isliye ham in halaaton ko sanbhaalane main safal nahin rah paae, kai muddon par rajya sarkaar asafal rahi
 Peace could not be established in the valley besides development work was stalled in Jammu and Ladakh
 jammu or ladakh kii janata ke saath bhedbhaav hua

 abhi chalegaa
 Every year Smart City used to be popular, but this time in the budget speech, Smart City did not find a place
 media bhi lagata he ki smart city se thak gaya he
 It was not there in the speech, after going into the grooves of the expenditure of major schemes, it was found that the budget of this ambitious plan of Modi government has been reduced
 aam taur par smart city or atal punaruddhar or shahari parivartan amrit yojana ke tahat milakar raashi bataai jaati he lekin aap alag alag bhi dekh sakate hai
 This amount was 9,559 crore in 2016-17, there is a provision of 9000 crore for 2017-18
 yani smart city kaa bajet saadhe paanch sau karod kam ho gaya he
 If you look at the budget of Amrit Yojana and Smart City separately, then the budget of Amrit Yojana is 5000 crore this year, compared to 4883 crore last year
 yani amrit yojana ke bajet main 117 karod kii maamuli vruddhi hui he
 The budget of smart city is 4000 crores which was 4675 crores in the last budget
 yani smart city kaa bajet 675 karod kam hua he
 Reports of what progress has been made under the Amrit scheme could not be found
 bharat sarkaar ne 21 janvari 2015 ko hryday yojana shuru kii thi
 We went to the Heart Plan website
 website par yojana ke bare main jaankaree ke kalam main likhaa he ki is yojana ko nanvabar 2018 tak puraa hona he
 But it is written in the operational guidelines that it is to be completed within 27 months after the launch i
e
 by April 2017
 itnaa antar kaise he, ye to website department hi bataa saktaa he
 However, working in mission mode with a budget of 500 crores, 12 cities of heritage were to be rejuvenated
 iske liye 2015-16 ke bajet main iske liye 27
 22 crores was given
 2016-17 ke bajet main 200 karod kaa praavdhaan tha magar sanshodhit bajet main 150 karod ho gaya
 a budget of 150 crores has also been given for 2017-18
 bajet patr ke hisaab se 500 karod main se 328 karod hi diya gaya he lekin hryday yojana kii website ke anusaar sabhi shaharon ko 454 karod kii raashi di ja chuki he
 But the percentage of the amount given to cities says something else
 agar kareeb puri raashi di ja chuki he to phir ajmer ko sau fisadi, amravati ko 93 fisadi, varanasi ko 85 fisadi, mathura ko 35 pratishat, amritsar or puri ko aath pratishat, gaya ko pandrah pratishat kii raashi manzur hui he
 There is no information on the website as to how much progress has been made
 shyama prasad rurban mishan kaa bajet 300 karod se badhaakar 1000 karod kiya gaya he
 There are 300 clusters to be built under this
 police sudhaar or aadhunikeekaran kaa bhi dekh lete hai
 The budget for modernization of police forces was 2235 crores in 2016-17
 2017-18 main 213 karod kam kar diya he
 2022 crore
 police adhisanrachana kaa bajet pichley saal 3183 karod tha
 There is an increase of 1264 crores in this year's budget
 4,447 karod he
 In his budget speech, the Finance Minister has said that under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, 133 km of roads are being constructed every day
 pichley saal ke bajet kii pragati report jab hamane dekhi to aankade kuch or kah rahe the
 Our progress in the national highway is not as spectacular as the media suggests
 bajet pragati report ke anusaar 2016-17 main 25,000 kimi sadak banane ke liye theka dene kaa mahatvakankshi lakshya rakhaa tha
 Till September 2016, only 3,969 km of road construction contracts were awarded
 oktober se lekar janvari tak yani chaar maheene kaa aankada states report nahin he
 In the previous budget, the target was that 10,000 km of road construction would be completed
 yah target puraa nahin hua he
 According to the budget report, 2,979 km of road construction was completed
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki wo ab pradhanmantri gramin sadak yojana ke tahat banane vaali sadak par nigaah rakhegi
 He should first monitor the National Highway
 sarkaar ko haive mantralay se poochna chahie ki sitambar tak ke hi aankade kyon hai
 Why not till December 2015-16 main 10,000 kimi sadak banane kaa theka diya lekin 6,029 kimi sadak hi puri ban saki
 In the budget speech, the Finance Minister said that 1,40,000 km long road has been constructed in the matter of construction of highways and rural roads from 2014-15 to this year
 pichley teen saal main sabase tej pragati hui he
 The Finance Minister could only state the condition of the previous year but he added the figures of three years
 ab aate hai skill india par jo ek bahuprachaarit abhiyaan he
 On the page number 17 of the Implementation Report, it has been said that under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, there is a target of skill development training of one crore people between 2016-20
 kitne logon ko di gai he, koi zikr nahin he
 However, it is written that work is in progress
 neshnal board for skill deveopment certification naam kii ek sanstha bani he
 It has set a target of giving skill training to one crore more people
 states report main kaary pragati par he yahi likhaa he
 Every budget is called a job-generating budget
 bajet implimentation paper ke pej number 18 par gaye
 In the last budget, the Finance Minister had announced a new scheme of 1000 crores that the government will give part of its provident fund to the employees who will be placed in the formal sector
 taaki companiyaan logon ko kaam par rakhane ke liye protsaahit hon
 Do you know what the status report says about this? yahi ki kaary pragati par he
 It is written on paragraph 67 that the government has collected only 155 crore rupees as its share of EPF
 isamen se bhi tees karod rupee textile sector main diye gaye hai
 The government would have told how many people got jobs according to 155 crores
 zaahir he formal sector main naukari paane waalon kii sankhya bahut kam rahi hogi
 Therefore, the government gave 155 crores
 naukari kii sankhya nahin bataai
 There was a budget of 1000 crores
 155 karod hi kharch hua
 There is no concrete figure of employment, but this figure of the government must have said a lot
 yahi nahin pradhanmantri rojgaar srijan yojana kaa bajet bhi lagaataar kam hota ja rahaa he
 In 2015-16, there was a provision of 1281 crore under it
 2016-17 main iske tahat 1120 karod kaa praavdhaan hua
 It has come down to 10,24 crores in the 2017-18 budget
 teen saal main 257 karod kii katautee ho chuki he
 The Prime Minister's Employment Generation Scheme (pmegp) has its own website
 ham jab is site par gaye
 The final data on this is for 2014-15, according to which one lakh 38,728 people were provided employment opportunities under the scheme that year
 ek hazaar karod ke bajet se ek lakh logon ko rojgaar kaa avasar dilaayaa gaya
 More than 18,000 projects have been built, with at least seven people employed in each project
 kam se kam is yojana ke bare main 2015-16, 2016-17 ke aankade hone chahie
 The lowest employment was created in 2014-15 as compared to earlier
 yah yojana 2008-09 se chal rahi he
 The schemes of the Prime Minister's name should have at least the latest information on the website
 tippaniyan We may have missed the budget paper
 magar bajet patr padhane kaa tarika hamen badal lenaa chahie
 The media imposes different priorities on you, how the budget was, how much the GDP was
 awwal to bajet sasta mahangaa ke chakkar main hi khatm ho jaataa tha, modi sarkaar is chakkar se nikal chuki he, media abhi tak fansaa hua he
 Read the budget paper completely
 yahaan aapako sawaal bhi milenge to jawaab bhi
 Only then you will know that the budget of Khelo India has increased from 118 crores to 350 crores
 khelon main exlence ko protsaahit karne kaa bajet thodaa sa kam ho gaya he
 From 365 crores to 312 crores
 bajet main jo ghoshnaa hui thi, usase to ham bhi prabhavit prathit ho rahe the magar jab koi doosraa angel lekar aa jaataa he to meri dilchaspee bad jaati he
 Because the second angle makes better sense of the first angle
 amrit yojana ke tahat kya pragati hui he isaki report nahin mil saki
 The heart plan was launched by the Indian government on 21 January 2015
 ham hryday yojana kii website par gaye
 In the column of information about the scheme on the website, it is written that this plan is to be completed by November 2018
 lekin oparational guidelins main likhaa he ki launch kiye jane ke baad 27 maheene ke bheetar puraa hona he yani ise april 2017 tak
 How much difference is there, only the website department can tell
 baharhaal 500 karod ke bajet se mishan mod main kaam karte hue viraasat ke 12 shaharon kaa kayakalp kar diya janaa tha
 27 for this in the 2015-16 budget
 22 karod diya gaya
 There was a provision of 200 crores in the budget of 2016-17 but 150 crores in the revised budget
 2017-18 ke liye bhi 150 karod kaa bajet diya gaya he
 According to the budget paper, only 328 crore has been given out of 500 crore, but according to the website of the heart plan, an amount of 454 crore has been given to all cities
 lekin shaharon ko di jane vaali raashi kaa pratishat to kuch or kahata he
 If almost the entire amount has been given, then Ajmer has approved 100%, Amravati 93%, Varanasi 85%, Mathura 35%, Amritsar and Puri eight%, Gaya fifteen percent
 kitni pragati hui he, website par koi jaankaree nahin he
 Shyama Prasad Rurban Mission's budget has been increased from 300 crores to 1000 crores

 Police also look for reforms and modernization

 vitt mantri ne apane bajet bhaashan main kaha he ki pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana ke tahat 133 kimi sadak har din ban rahi he
 When we saw the progress report of last year's budget, the figures were saying something else
 neshnal haive ke maamle main hamaari pragati waisi shandaar nahin he jaisi media bataata he
 According to the budget progress report, the ambitious target of awarding the contract for the construction of 25,000 km of roads was set in 2016-17
 sitambar 2016 tak sirf 3,969 kimi sadak banane ke hi theke diye gaye
 From October to January, the four-month data is not a status report
 pichley bajet main target tha ki 10,000 kimi sadak banane kaa kaam puraa kar liya jayega
 This target is not met
 bajet report ke anusaar 2,979 kimi sadak banane kaa kaam puraa hua
 The government has said that it will now monitor the road constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana
 use sabase pehle neshnal haive kii monitering kerani chahie
 The government should ask the highway ministry why the figures are till September
 disambar tak ke kyon nahin hai
 In 2015-16, he gave the contract to build 10,000 km road but only 6,029 km road could be completed
 vitt mantri ne bajet bhaashan main kaha ki haive or gramin sadak banane ke maamle main 2014-15 se lekar is saal tak 1,40,000 kimi lambii sadak bani he
 The fastest progress has been made in the last three years
 vitt mantri sirf pichley saal kaa hi haal bataa sakate the magar unhone teen saal ke aankadon ko jod diya
 Now come to Skill India which is a much hyped campaign
 iske bare main implimentation report ke pej number 17 par kaha gaya he ki pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat 2016-20 ke bich ek karod logon ko kaushal vikaas kii training kaa target he
 How many people have been given, there is no mention
 alabatta yah likhaa hua he ki kaary pragati par he
 An institution named the National Board for Skill Development Certification has been formed
 isane or ek karod logon ko skill training dene kaa target rakhaa he
 It is written in the status report that work is in progress
 har bajet ko naukariyaan paidaa karne vaala bajet kaha jaataa he
 Goed to page number 18 of the Budget Implementation Paper
 pichley bajet main vitt mantri ne 1000 karod kii ek nai yojana kaa elaan kiya tha ki formal sector main jo bhi karmchaaree rakhaa jayega, uske provident fund kaa hissaa sarkaar degi
 So that companies are encouraged to hire people
 kya aapako pataa he ki is bare main states report kya kahati he
 That work is in progress
 paragraph 67 par likhaa hua he ki sarkaar ne 155 karod rupee hi ipief ke apane hisse ke taur par jamaa kiye hai
 Of this, thirty crore rupees have been given in the textile sector
 sarkaar 155 karod ke hisaab se hi bataa detii ki kitne logon ko naukari mili he
 It is obvious that the number of job seekers in the formal sector would have been very less
 isliye sarkaar ne 155 karod bataa diya
 Did not indicate job number
 1000 karod kaa bajet tha
 155 crore was spent
 rojgaar kaa koi thos aankada to nahin he magar sarkaar kaa yah aankada kaaphi kuch to kahata hi hoga
 Not only this, the budget of the Prime Minister Employment Generation Scheme is also getting reduced continuously
 2015-16 main iske tahat 1281 karod kaa praavdhaan tha
 In 2016-17, a provision of 1120 crores was made under it

 With the budget of one thousand crores, one lakh people were provided employment opportunities
 18,000 se adhik project bane hai, har project main kam se kam saat logon ko kaam mila he
 At least this plan should have figures for 2015-16, 2016-17
 2014-15 main pehle kii tulana main sabase kam rojgaar kaa srijan hua tha
 The scheme has been in operation since 2008-09
 pradhanmantri ke naam se chalane vaali yojanao kii website par to kam se kam letest jaankaree honi chahie thi

 First, the budget used to end in the cycle of cheap and expensive, Modi government has gone out of this cycle, the media is still stuck

 We were also affected by the announcement made in the budget, but my interest increases when someone comes with another angle

 1000 karod kaa bajet tha
 155 crore was spent

 siem yogi ne congress par vibhaajan kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue teen talaak bill kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Yogi said that the Congress' vote on the triple talaq bill is also not clear
 raily main yogi ne logon ko yaad dilaayaa ki karnataka main janme hanuman ne mata sita kii mukti ke liye prabhu ram kii sahaayta kii thi
 Now North and South will have to come together to win BJP
 'har rajya main haar rahi he congress'karnataka pahuncheuttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanathane kaha ki bijepi vikaas ke agenda par tiki hui he
 The Congress has divided the people, that's why the Congress is losing in every state
 himachal pradesh or gujarat main congress haar gai, jabaki gujarat main vikaas ke chalate bijepi chhathvin baar satta main aa gai
 'congress Confuse on Triple Talaq Bill' Yogi said, 'karnataka is slow in the path of development
 ek samay tha, jab bengalooru iti hub hua karata tha, lekin ab ye shahar kanoon or vyavastha se judi samasyaon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Congress has always been trying to divide people on the basis of caste and religion
 teen talaak bill par bhi congress mat spasht nahin he, isiilie congress teen talaak bill ko paas nahin hone de rahi he
 "hindutva is not a religion", Yogi said, adding that he arrived in Bangalore on Saturday night and read the statement of the CM of Karnataka in the newspaper, which made him feel that he too is now talking about Hindutva
 yogi ne bataaya ki hindutv koi dharm nahin he, balki jeene kii ek raah he
 Addressing the rally, Yogi asked to remember Lord Rama, Mother Sita
 yogi ne kaha ki mat bhuuliye hanuman kaa janm karnataka main hua tha
 We have to bring back the old glory of the state
 bhagwaan hanuman or bhagwaan ram ne milakar mata sita ko mukt karaayaa tha or ab uttar or dakshin bharat kii janata ko bijepi kii jeet ke liye saath aana hoga
 UP CM Yogi said that if BJP can win in Gujarat and Himachal, why not in Karnataka
 yogi ne bataaya ki uttar pradesh kai samasyaayein thim, lekin pichley 10 maheenon main sabhi samasyaon ko hal nikaal liya gaya, piem modi ke kaaran hi rajya kaa vikaas sambhav hua

 Now the second house will not get tax rebate as before

 That is, the government does not want to relax those people who buy more than one property and take home loan and through it get tax exemption
 nae niyam main pehali baar ghar kharidne waalon ko tex chhot main praathamikta di ja rahi he
 It does not give exemption to those who live in their house and are earning rent by buying other property

 In the new rule, for the first time home buyers are given priority in tax exemption
 isamen un logon ko chhot nahin di gai he jo apane ghar main rahete hai or duusari property kharidkar usase kiraaya kama rahe hai
 Earlier the landlord could claim full exemption on the interest of the rented property, whereas the people living in their own house were entitled to claim up to Rs 2 lakh only

 That is, the person who built a house by taking a loan, can now claim the benefit of rebate up to Rs 2 lakh (whether he rents the house or stays in it)

 randha nadi apane bacchon ke liye jane kab se anchal failaae hue he
 Such is his love that the fields are not thirsty
 usee ne khetiharon ko bhukh se bachaaya
 Made the paddy earrings boil with their milk
 bhutte ke kheton ko motiyon se sajaayaa
 But she would never have been so happy
 keshkal ke jangalon main chupchaap bah rahi he randha
 His name is known only to those who are living on his caress
 randha hi nahin, chhattisgarh main uski kai bahanen or sakhi-saheliyaan bhi hai, magar gumnaam
 Randha would have put her full strength, but still could not completely calm the apps of her children like Budharam
 apana pani unke kheton tak nahin pahunchaa pai
 The crop was so low that Budhram, the owner of a five-acre farm, thought that when the loss had to be cultivated, why not live in the city
 saat logon kaa pet paatna uske liye hameshaa badi chunauti rahi
 He would have left farming if hope had not woken up
 maatenga ke is kisaan ko nai aas tab najar ai, jab apane jaise dukhiyaaron kaa dukh dur hote dekha
 Farmers of farmers like him were seen spilling grain
 usne dekha ki randha kaa pani kheton tak pahunchaana ab kisi ke liye bhi badi baat nahin rahi
 The fields along the banks of the river drains of Randha and its like are now green for twelve months
 in kheton main ab motorpampon se dhakadhak pani pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 Paddy earrings have started swinging in the music of these pumps
 budhram ab kheti chhodkar kahin or jane kii soch hi nahin saktaa
 In the last nine years, life began to change slowly
 sookhe mausam main jo khet munh chidhaayaa karte the, vahi khet ab thitholi karte hai
 Blossoms
 poochhate hai, "bol, kaa saag khabe budhram?" (kaho, kya sabji khaanaa chaahoge budhram?)budhram ke kheton main ab dhan ke saath subjiyan bhi ugaai ja sakati hai
 Variety of vegetables
 inhen vah kha bhi saktaa he or bazaar main bech kar chaar paise kama bhi saktaa he
 He did not think that he would find the pump so easily
 kuch kaagajon main thodi bahut likhaa padhi kerani padi or bas, mil gaya pump
 He says that he has to do so much and it is not a difficult task for a farmer who breaks a stone and turns it into fertile fields
 pump mil jane se ab vah donon mausam main dhan kii fasal le paaegaa
 The government is already giving a good rate of paddy and now each bag is getting a reward of Rs 270
 bonus ke rup main mehnat ke liye shaabaasi mil rahi he
 Manure is helping the seeds
 keshkal ilaake main budhram jaise ne sarkari madad mil jane se chamatkaar kar dikhaaya he
 Earlier, an average of 10 quintals of paddy per hectare was available in this area, now it is doubled
 ausatan 20 quintal tak
 Some- one is taking production up to 80 quintals
 is ilaake main pichley chaar saalon main dhai sau kisaanon ko sarkaar ne pump uplabdh karaae hai
 In the same year, 58 people were given pumps
 inamen bijli se chalane vaale pump bhi hai or dijal pump bhi
 Farmers have taken more electric pumps than diesel pumps, that is, electricity has reached their fields
 budhaaram ke kheton kii khushboo leni ho to kabhi aaie keshkal
 Spinner Harbhajan Singh is always in the discussion for some reason
 abaki baar unhone jiesti ko lekar es twit kar diya he jo solash media main trend kar rahaa he
 Bhajji wrote on the tweet that while paying the bill in the restaurant, it seemed as if the central and state governments had eaten with him
 twitor par unke twit karte hi logon ne is par khub pratikriyaayein di
 It is to be noted that after the implementation of GST from July 1, other taxes have been abolished in the entire country and now the state GST and central GST are taken
 nae niyam ke mutabik restaurant main 12 fisadi state jiesti or 18 fisadi sengment kaa tex liya jaataa he
 However, it is not the case that the GST rule is being implemented in all hotels and restaurants
 yah unheen par lagu he jinka registration kiya gaya he
 While making payment of bill after dinner in restaurant, it feels like state govt & central govt both had a dinner with us
 
 
 aise main harbhajan kaa yah twit centre sarkaar ke liye 'doosraa' se kam nahin he
 It remains to be seen whether there is any response from the ruling party
 iske alaava short notification main yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki fees bhugtan kii antim taarikh 21 november he
 The admit card will be released one week before the exam to be held in December 2019

 Normal and OBC students will have to pay Rs 600 and SAC / ST students Rs 400
 vahiin, divyang aavedakon ko 100 rupee fees bharani hogi
 If the applicant wants to take both primary and higher level exams, then he has to pay double the fees
 upitate pariksha pichley kuch saalon se oktober or november main yojit hoti aa rahi he
 But this time the exam has been delayed
 kul milakar pariksha disambar main hogi to ab isaki taiyaari ke liye zyada samay nahin bachaa he

 Aishwarya Rai is very happy for Bachchan's fans
 reports ke mutabik aishwarya raay bachchan hollywood filmon main kambek karne vaali hai
 It is reported that he got a Hollywood film offer
 actress ne hollywood projects ko handle karne ke liye ek team bhi hair kii he
 Even before the arrival of Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone in Hollywood, Aishwarya was a well-known Indian face
 aishwarya ab tak hollywood kii paanch filmon main kaam chuki hai
 He has done commendable work in Hollywood's Bride and Prejudice, The Mistress of Spaces, Provoked, The Last Legion and The Pink Panther-2
 bollywood se lekar hollywood tak aishwarya raay bachchan aaj ek antarrashtriya cheharaa ban chuki hai
 Aishwarya was last seen in the Bollywood film Fanney Khan (2018) opposite Rajkumar Rao and Anil Kapoor
 magar box-offis par film kuch kamaal nahin kar pai
 Earlier, Aishwarya had won the hearts of people with her performance and great look in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016)
 haalanki aishwarya ne pati abhishek bachchan ke saath film gulab jamun kaa zikr bhi kiya tha, film ko lekar koi taaja apadet nahin hai
 Apart from this, he was also being speculated to sign Mani Ratnam's next film with father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan, which has not been officially announced yet
 pinkavila kii report ke mutabik aishwarya hollywood project ko lekar interested hai or isse jude paper work abhi prakriya main hai
 If everything goes well, the film can be announced officially by the end of the year
 ek anya sutara ke mutabik aishwarya ne hollywood kii filmon ke saath deal karne main madad ke liye ek team niyukt kiya he
 The VIP culture gets its energy from the red light in-built hekdari of more influential people
 modi sarkaar apni ore se rob kii pahchaan maani jane vaali laal batti hataane ke aadesh de chuki he
 The entire nation welcomed this order given in April as a step taken to be equal
 halaat main kya badlaav hua, ye jaanane ke liye india today ne reality check karaayaa to saamne aayaa ki sattadhari vishisht varg kaa rob jhaadne vaala ravaiya ab bhi jas kaa tas he
 The red lights are no longer flashing on their own cars, but the noise of the sirens (hooters) of police escorts following them continues to indicate that the VIP convoy is passing by
 jaanch se saamne aayaa ki baari suraksha tamzam se las nirvaachit janpratinidhiyon ke kafile ko pehle nikal jane ke liye baaki trephic ko ab bhi roak diya jaataa he
 In such a case, the much publicized ban on the red light has become a spoof of the eyes
 badi sankhya main viipi ne, jinamein kuch kendriya mantri bhi shaamil hai, ne apane pad kaa rob jhaadne ke liye nae tareeke nikaal liye hai
 When the motor convoy of Union Minister of State Purshottam Khodabhai Rupala was seen passing by in the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat, he himself testified to his unique status
 narmada ke daure par pahunche mantri kii car kii chat par laal batti nahin lagi thi lekin iske baavjood saaf ehsaas ho rahaa tha ki kisi khaas-m-khaas kii sawari nikal rahi he
 a similar view took place in Vadodara when another Union Minister of State, Mansukh Mandavia, arrived to attend an event
 jab mandavia se laal batti ke bina bhi 'laal batti samskruti' ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone pradhanmantri kii pahal ko bada kadam bataaya
 With the help of his hands, he told the frills running with him as part of the necessary security arrangements
 mandavia ne kaha, 'main bhi kisi saamaanya naagarik kii tarah hi chalanaa chahta hum, lekin suraksha kaa set-ap alag he
 i have to walk according to the government that gives me the details of security
 isse zyada or kuch saath nahin hota
 When India Today's investigative team turned to Chandauli in Uttar Pradesh, police jeeps with the loud sound of sirens were seen with the car of Minister of State Rajendra Pratap Singh
 rajendra pratap singh se jab baat kii gai to bhi unkepiche ek guard dhoop se bachaane ke liye chhayadeta khadaa tha
 Rajendra Pratap Singh said, 'there is no siren or red light on my car
 lekin system apni jagah he
 People are standing in the sun
 meri duty he ki main ruuk kar unase baat karun
 It is all part of the system
 ise duusare nazariye se nahin dekha janaa chahie
 At a recent Sangam event in Allahabad, VIP culture also showed its fullness
 yogi adityanath ke motor kafile ke saath kai vidhayakon or anya vishisht vyaktiyon kii kaaron parlaal batti kii jagah syran lagedikhai die
 Madhya Pradesh also saw a similar view of power and status during the India Today reality check
 madhya pradesh ke mantri gauri shankar bisen ne kaha, 'syran par koi bain nahin he
 How to get out of the crowd if there are no sirens
 'devbhumi uttarakhand main bhi kaaron par syran apwaad kii tarah nahin balki saamaanya prachlan kii tarah dikhaai die
 Such cars were seen at many places in Dehradun
 india today kii jaanch main pashchim bengal main laal batti par bain sambandhi centre sarkaar ke aadesh kaa khulla ulanghan hote dikhaa
 Many influential people in the state do not seem to be ready to leave the red light as their privilege
 rajya mantri shanti ram mahato ne apni viipi car se utarate hue kaha, 'laal batti kaa istemaal koi bada mudda nahin he
 We will not remove it unless we get an order from the state government
 ' The issue of government land received by the business associate of Anar Patel, the daughter of Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, has been on hold
 anaar patel ke sahyogi ko 422 acre jameen 15 rupee varg meter ke hisaab mili thi
 At that time stamp duty of this land was charged Rs 180 square meter
 yani stamp duty se bhi 91
 This land was given in 6 percent less
 2010 kaa he maamlanar patel kebijaness partneradakshesh shah or amol seth kii company wildwoods ko 2010 main ye jameen aavantit hui thi
 This land is near Geer Lion Century in Amreli
 ek jameen ke liye do ratejis ilaake main anaar patel ke bijness partner ko ye jameen mili he, usee ilaake main muralidhar gau seva trust ne jameen ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Istrust got land for Rs 671 per square meter
 jameen kaa land yuj bhi badladonon jameen ko lekar aavanton ke faisle par muhar ek hi sarkari baithak main lagi thi
 But the rates were set differently for both
 jaanch main ye bhi tathy saamne aayaa ki kheti kii jameen kaland yujabhi badla gaya
 So that the company can build a resort there
 cameti ne sadhi chuppihaalanki jameen muhaiyaa karaane vaali cameti kaa kahana he ki jis ilaake main anaar patel ke sahyogi ko jameen mili he us ilaake main stamp duty 180 rupee varg meter he
 But then how the Wildwoods company was given 15 rupees a square meter, they do not have the answer
 niyam ke mutabik mili jameenemeti kaa kahana he ki wildwoods company ko jameen dene main koi gadabadi nahin hui he or koi sarkari dabaav bhi nahin tha
 Everything has been done under the purview of law
 anandiben par aanchagauratlab he ki 2010 main jab ye jameen aavantit hui thi us vakt narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the or anandiben patel us vakt rajasav mantri thim

 Sarabjit continued to die miserably in Kot Lakhpat Jail of Pakistan and the whole of India felt pained by the news of the crimes being perpetrated on him
 lekin ab jab sarbajit kii berahami se hatya kii ja chuki he, unke gaanv ko yaad aa rahi he sarbajit kii jubaani suni julmon kii kahani
 Nobody had thought that Sarabjit, who disappeared twenty three years ago, would be destined to be like this
 lekin logon ke jehan main ek baar phir kaundh gai wo chitthee, jisamen logon ne pakistan ke julmo-sitam kii kahani sarbajit kii jubaani suni thi
 In his letter sent to India, Sarabjit wrote: 'I am being given some food in the past two to three months
 ise khaane se meraa sharir galata ja rahaa he
 My left hand is in a lot of pain and the right leg is becoming increasingly weak
 khaanaa jehar jaisaa he
 It is neither possible to eat it, nor it is possible to digest it after eating '
 sarbajit ne chitthee tab likhi thi jab lahore ke kot lakhapat jail main dard bardaasht se baahar ho gaya tha
 But the jail officers continued to behave worse than the butchers
 sarbajit ne jail main dhimaa jehar dene kii ashanka jataate hue likhaah'jab bhi meraa dard bardaasht se baahar hota he or main jail adhikariyon se dard kii dawa maangata hum to meraa majaak udaaya jaataa he
 Every effort is made to make me mad
 mujhe ekant kothri main daal diya gaya he or mere liye rihaai kaa ek din bhi intjaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya he'
 Every word of Sarabjit's letter made the people of Bhikwind angry
 khud ko begunaah bataate hue sarbajit ne likhaah'main ek bahut hi garib kisaan hum or meri giraftaar galat pahchaan kii vajah se kii gai he
 On the night of 28 August 1990, i was badly addicted to alcohol and walked past the border
 main jab border par pakadaa gaya to mujhe berahami se peeta gaya
 i couldn't even see who was killing me
 mujhe chen main baandh diya gaya or ankhon par pattee baandh di gai'
 Sarabjit was persecuted in Pakistan jail and all the complaints in the court were ignored
 'pakistan kii police or adaalat nark se bhi badtar hai
 They want me to confess that i am Manjit Singh, not Sarabjit Singh
 yahaan ke saare jaanch adhikari maanakar baithe hai ki punjab praant main hue dhamaake ke peeche main hi hum'
 In jail, Sarabjit kept watching death come close by moment, but like a mighty warrior, he fought against oppression
 vatan vaapasi kii ummid kabhi nahin chodi
 Now when this mighty warrior has returned to the country
 to apni mitti dekh paane ke liye sharir main jaan baaki nahin rahi

 The absconding criminal of India and the lord of this nation claims that any Hindu in the world can get citizenship here
 kyonki jo aasthaa ke luteraa he wo yahaan sanathan dharm kii rakshak hone kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 Swami Nityananda, who became famous worldwide with a sex tape with his Sadhvi, has bought an island near the Latin American country of Equador and declared it a new country and named it Kailasa
 is tapu kii lokation kya he
 How is his map? isaki jaankaree yaa to kailasa ke bhagwaan ko he yaa is sristi ke bhagwaan ko
 Lord of Kailasa i
e
 Nityananda
 baharhaal ham yahaan ek chiz saaf kar den ki duniya ke nakshe par aap ye jo kailasa dekh rahe hai
 It is just a symbolic picture
 iskaa vaastaviktaa se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Because the Kailasa nation of which the accused of rape is doing Nityananda, where it has not been cleared yet
 duniya ke is iklauta hindu raashtra kailasa kii lokation bhale saaf naa ho
 But apart from this, Nityananda has disclosed all the things on his website
 masalan rashtriya pashu bhagwaan shiv ke bail nandi ko banaaya gaya he
 'kailasa' has its own passport
 apana tikona jhanda bhi he
 On which a Nandi bull appears with a picture of Nityananda
 jhande par nityanand ko bhagwaan shankar ke andaaz main dikhaaya gaya he
 And Nandi is worshiping him
 iske alaava kailasa kaa rashtriya phool camel
 National Bird Sharabam
 to rashtriya ped bargad ko rakhaa gaya he
 Their goals in the economy are to create the only religious economy in the world
 ye kis tarah kii iconmi hogi
 The secret of this is currently buried in Nityananda's chest
 kailasa kii website ke mutabik ye dharti kaa sabase mahaan hindu raashtra he
 And welcomes all Hindus of the world who want to come here
 phir chaahe wo kisi bhi nasl, ling, sampradaay yaa jati se hon
 They will be provided with a safe haven
 jis nityanand par sadhvi kaa yon shoshan karne or masuumon ko bandhak banaakar pratadit karne kaa aarope he wo yahaan hinduon ko ek aisa desh dene kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 Where there will be peace and without any violence or interference, Hindus will get a chance to follow their culture and art

 Now the question is why this fugitive accused of Hindustan made his own country
 chup to wo kahin bhi saktaa tha
 Then what is the point of making a country
 or makasad kya ise jaananaa zaruri he
 But according to the information that is coming at the moment, Nityananda claims that he has created Kailasa nation not only to protect Sanatan Dharma but also to give shelter to the oppressed Hindus all over the world
 yahaan hinduon kii apni sarkaar hogi
 Will have its own cabinet
 inke vibhaag bhi baant die gaye hai
 For example, departments such as Department of State, Department of Technology, Department of Enlightenment Civilization, Department of Human Services and Department of Commerce are being reported there
 hindustan se nityanand ke hindu raashtra kii duuri kareeb 16000 kilometre yaa usase bhi zyaada ho sakati he
 The main languages of the nation of Kailasa near the Latin American country of Ecuador are English, Sanskrit and Tamil
 kailasa kii arthvyavastha kaise chalegi iskaa bhi model taiyaar kiya gaya he
 One of the objectives of Kailasa is to reinvent the temple-based lifestyle
 yani aisa jivan, jo mandir or isaki gatividhiyon ke ird-gird ghumta ho
 According to the website, there will be free education, health services for everyone and even free food for everyone
 jo yon shoshan or kidnaping jaise sangeen krime ke liye hindustan main wonted bhagoda he
 Know why he has made his own nation to avoid the law of the country
 kyonki kabhi-kabhi use laga he ki vahi bhagwaan he
 Nityananda has made him his new country by purchasing an island near the Latin American country of Equador
 haalanki ye pehali baar nahin he jab kisi ne tapu kharida ho
 Even before this, many people of the country have bought the island in different places of the world
 magar desh kisi ne nahin banaaya
 Now if Nityananda's effort is successful, then the fugitives who run away from the country will get a new destination
 bharat kii police or agenciyaan peeche naa padatin to bhagwaan banane ke liye nityanand ko hindustan se itnaa dur jane kii zarurat hi nahin thi
 But by playing with the faith of the people, this man created such a huge empire of hypocrisy that now it is necessary to be accounted for
 lekin isse pehle kii desh ke duusare tamaam baabaaon kii tarah ise bhi salaakhon ke peeche bheja jaataa
 It left Kailasa via Nepal
 latin america desh ecuador ke nazadik ek tapu jise isane kharidkar hindu raashtra ghoshit karne kaa daawa kiya he
 The police had been searching for the fugitive Nityananda, who claimed to be full of miraculous powers
 magar ab uski khabar ai bhi to wo itani dur nikal chukaa he ki use pakadana mushkil he
 This god of Kailasa is wanted in many cases from sexual abuse to kidnapping
 sadhvi kii aasthaa se khilne ke maamle main to ye jail kii hawa bhi kha chukaa he
 And it became famous only when its sex CD appeared in front of the world
 laga ab is farzi baba kaa kariyar khatm ho chukaa he
 But after about 7-8 years in oblivion it returned again
 or is baar huliya badalakar ye saamne aayaa
 But do not know what is in the face that even after knowing its reality, people started getting into it again
 or phir se isane logon kii aasthaa se khilne shuru kar diya
 But again the headlines came when his own devotee in Ahmedabad Ashram accused his 4 children as hostages
 lekin jab tak police is tak pahunchati tab tak ye rafuchakkar ho chukaa tha
 Not only this, in a rape case, Karnataka police is also looking for it
 sab ko laga nityanand kaa khel ab khatm ho gaya
 He was scheduled to go to jail
 magar achaanak wo gaayab ho gaya
 It was doubtful that Nityananda would have left the country
 lekin ye andaaza to kisi ne nahin lagaaya tha ki wo kanoon se bhaagate-bhaagate apane liye alag desh kaa hi nirmaan kar legaa
 And the judge and law of that country will become their own
 ek aisi duniya jahaan kaa raja bhi vahi he
 Same rules and laws as well
 wo apradhi jise jail main hona chahie wo saat samandar paar bhagwaan bana baitha he
 And from there, the international is trying to play with people's faith in the name of religion
 khud ko shiv kaa avatar bataane vaala ye shaks koi chamatkaari nahin balki ek dhongi he
 Is a criminal
 ek bhagoda he jo kanoon ke shikanje se bachane ke liye desh chhodkar faraar ho gaya he
 And now Kailasa is claiming to have built the nation
 haalanki is khabar ko yun hi khaarij bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It seems that all this is part of Nityananda's planning
 jo wo pichley kai maheenon se kar rahaa tha
 The plan for this new country was prepared a few months ago and Nityananda had put forth the concept of this country in his youtube channel
 darasal, bharat main nityanand kii pole khul chuki he
 He knew that for a long time now he would not be able to escape from the clutches of the law
 isiilie usne videsh main is nae desh ko banane kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Nityananda's next target is the foreigners whom he is trying to cheat by claiming to give peace through Hindu religion, culture, yoga and meditation
 duniyaabhaar main apana samrajya to usne pehle se hi bana rakhaa he
 He also has ashrams in different countries
 aise main agar kailasa raashtra astitv main aa gaya yaa use manyata mil gai to phir ise pakadana aasaan nahin hoga

 Urjit Patel and the Finance Ministry have been asked several important questions on the demonetization decision by the Public Accounts Committee
 in sawaalon ke jawaab par santusht nahin hone par samiti pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi talab kar sakati he
 The Public Accounts Committee last week asked questions on the decision of the Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance for censorship
 samiti ne rigerv bank governor urjit patel or vitt mantralay ke varisht adhikariyon ko in sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye 20 janvari tak kaa samay diya he
 The PAC has summoned Governor Urjit Patel, Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa and Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on 20 January to answer these questions
 piesi ke chairman or varisht congress netaa kevi thomas ne kaha ki yadi rigerv bank or vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon se sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mili to apane adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue samiti pradhanmantri ko talab kar sakati he

 In this meeting, the Prime Minister assured that after the decision taken on 8 November, the situation will be normal in 50 days
 samiti ke adhyaksh ke mutabik pradhanmantri apane 50 din main sthiti ko saamaanya karne ke vaade par khare nahin utre hai jisase puure faisle par sawaal uth rahaa he

 thomas ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ab vah apane galat faisle ko sahi tehraane kii kavayad main lagi hui he
 On the issue of demonetisation, if the committee calls the Prime Minister to clarify, then these 5 questions can be asked - 1
 is faisle main koun-koun shaamil tha?2
 How much money has been deposited in banks after the announcement of demonetisation? 3
 kya aam aadmi ko apane bank se apana paisa nikaalane se rokane ke liye koi kanoon he?4
 How much money has been circulated back to the economy after the demonetization decision? 5
 kaledhan ke mudde par notebandi kitna safal rahaor aam aadmi ke saath-saath arthvyavastha par faisle kaa kya asar padaa
 Making a serious comment on the decision of demonetisation, the chairman of the committee has said that in a country where call drop is a serious problem, how can the government take the entire country to cashless system
 gauratlab he ki public acount samiti desh main niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii report kii samiksha karata he or jaruri maamalon main tippanee kar saktaa he

 com / lqnh82lznd The political battle between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been at its peak for the last few months
 na to piem modi or na hi mamata banerjee ek-duusare ko rajnatik maidan main gherne main koi kasar rakhte hai
 Even during the Lok Sabha elections, the political battle of these two veteran leaders is going to be very interesting
 kyonki bengal main ye donon hi netaa ek hi din apane-apane chunaav prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne vaale hai
 It is worth noting that both political rivals will start the election campaign from the areas of North Bengal
 aise main siyasat par najar rakhane waalon ke liye vah din bada shandaar rahegaa
 First Prime Minister Narendra Modi will start the election rally, and on the other hand Mamta Banerjee will also thunder in Bengal on the same day
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee rajya main apane loksabhaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat ek hi din buudhvaar ko karenge
 BJP sources said that Modi will address two rallies in Siliguri and Kolkata in North Bengal
 duusari taraf mamata banerjee kooch bihar jile ke dinahataa main jansabha ko sambodhit karke apane chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karengi
 This region also falls in North Bengal
 buudhvaar ko silligudi main piem kii raily new jalpaigudi railway stesan ke paas railway kii jameen par hogi
 On the other hand, Mamta's public meeting will be held at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata
 bhaajapa sutron ke mutabik modi 7 or 10 april ko bengal main do or reliyon ko sambodhit karenge
 a Trinamool Congress leader said that Mamata Banerjee was to start the campaign on April 4, but it was done a day before, not being a little behind from the BJP
 TMC sutron ne bataaya ki mamata banerjee teen april se 17 may ke bich rajya main 100 reliyon ko sambodhit kar sakati hai

 Film Name: Freaky Alidirector: Sohail Khanstar Cast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Amy Jackson, Arbaaz Khan, Jas Arora, Seema Biswasrating: 2 Star is the first film by actor-director Sohail Khan in which his brother Salman Khan is not an actor
 is film main sohail ne kisi bade hero ke bajaay behtareen actaranvazuddin siddiquiko mukhya kirdaar nibhaane ke liye chunaa he
 How is this step of Sohail out of the box, ie 'freaky Ali', let's know
 kahani:film kii kahani anaath ali kii he jise marathi aurat ne paala or bada kiya
 From selling chadhi to hafti recovery, Ali does everything to make his mother happy but success does not come to him
 Then one day, Takdir takes him to the golf club and Ali's jauhar, who plays street cricket in the locality, recognizes his own
 phir jab ehsaas hota he ki golf hi uski manzil he to wo tamaam pareshaaniyon ko paar kar golf champion banataa he yaa nahin, ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 Script: The film holds up to a considerable extent until the interval
 film main aise kai maukey aate hai jahaan aap hansane par majaboor ho jaaenge
 Nawaz has played a monkey log with Chadhi
 saath hi kai or seens hai jisamen unki comic timming laajawab he
 But Ali is interesting on one side and the other plot where the underworld is shown in a funny way
 vahiin, jabardastee ke jokes daale gaye hai jo aapako bor karata he or aisa lagata jaise tivi kaa koi kamedi sho chal rahaa ho
 After the interval, the pace of the film becomes very slow and the film starts to end, now finish the film by winning the hero
 abhinay:navazuddin siddiki behtareen actor hai or wo puri tarah se kirdaar main he lekin yahi baat baaki kalakaaron ke liye nahin kah sakate
 Jus Arora is a golfer but when the dialogue is spoken, all the weight is lost
 emi jekson naam maatr sirf gane ke liye rakhi gai hai
 Arbaaz Khan and Jackie Shroff also could not do anything special
 kul milakar navaj jaise kalakaar ko film apane kandhe par uthaane padati he
 This film can be seen only for the payment of Nawaz
 kamjor kadi:film kaa sangeet, kamjor second half or or navaj ke alaava sabhi kaa bura abhinay jiske liye jimmedaar hai nirdeshkasohel khan
 Strong link: Nawaz

 And only nawaz gajiabad ke sai upavan sthit mandir main yuvak-yuvati hatyakand kaa police ne khulaasa karte hue do aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The main accused in the murder is Delhi Police
 beete somvaar ko sai upavan sthit mandir main yuvak annu chouhan or yuvati priti urf golu kii agyaat logon ne goliyon se bhunkar hatya kar di thi
 During the investigation, the police came to know that Annu and Preity were lovers and were about to get married soon
 diaiji upendra agarwal ne bataaya ki yuvati priti ke annu chouhan se pehle dinesh naam ke shaks ke saath bhi avaidh sambandh the
 Actually Preity was the sister-in-law of Dinesh's brother and hence he was supposed to come to Preeti's place, but later Preity had a relationship with Annu
 dinesh dilli police main daroga he or trephic police main tainaat he
 Preeti had stopped talking to Dinesh and changed her number as well, due to which Dinesh started to get the word
 isi ko lekar dinesh ne donon ko maut ke ghat utaarne kaa plan kiya
 Finishing his duty on 25 March, Dinesh along with his partner Pintu Sharma went to the girl's house in her Swift car where she came to know that Preeti had gone to the temple
 dinesh usase milane mandir panhucha to vahaan priti kaa mangetar bhi tha
 Seeing both Dinesh together, the fire was extinguished and he fired rash bullets on both of them with his service pistol
 usne donon par 7 round fire kiye jinamein 4 goliyaan priti ko lageen or 3 goliyaan surendra ko lageen or donon ne vahiin dam tod diya
 At the time of the incident, Dinesh's partner was standing outside the temple located in Sai Upvan with a car and after carrying out the incident, Dinesh got into the car and ran away
 police ke liye ye cese blind tha lekin police ne 4 din ke andar hi is sansanikhej vaardaat kaa khulaasa kar hatyaropee daaroga or unke dost ko giraftaar kar liya

 Reddy told news agency PTI, 'it will be difficult for the state governments to implement such a scheme as they depend heavily on the Center for finances and debt limits

 Panagariya said, 'NYAY will be difficult to implement and achieve its goal

 Issues of incentives, fairness issues and fiscal challenge
 ' yojana par tippanee karte hue panagadhiya ne kaha ki is yojana ke tahat paanch karod parivaar ko prati parivaar har maheene 6,000 rupee masik diya jayega
 It also guarantees these families an income of Rs 12,000 per month
 unhone kaha, ‘kya hoga ki agar ek parivaar kii aay keval 4,000 rupee masik he or duusare kii 8,000 rupee masik? kya 4,000 vaali aay ko 8,000 rupee tathaa duusare ko 4,000 rupee masik milegaa? agar aisa he to 12,000 rupee se kam aay vaale koi kyon kaam karegaa? aakhirkaar uski aay chaahe jo bhi 12,000 rupee to hogi hi
 Pangarhia said that in fact serious incentive problem will arise with the scheme
 unhone kaha, 'agar yojana ke tahat masik aadhaar par chinhit pariwaron ko 6,000 rupee diya ja jaataa he, chaahe uski aay kuch bhi kyon na ho, aap us parivaar ko masik aay 12,000 rupee nahin uplabdh kara sakate agar uski 6,000 rupee se kam he
 Pangarhia said that there is a fiscal challenge related to this program
 unhone tark dete hue kaha ki agar 12,000 rupee prati maheene sarvaadhik 20 pratishat garib pariwaron ko aay kii guarantee di jaati he, tab 6,000 prati parivaar aparyaapt hoga

 On the other hand, Reddy said, the Center has the potential to increase its fiscal deficit and there are no major hurdles on the financial front
 purv governor ne kaha, ‘aise main is tarah ke kaaryakramon kaa kriyanvayan tabhi ho saktaa he jab centre ise apane haath main le
 You should have no objection if the Center can only include it in the budget, aims at the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM)

 BJP ko aath din baad khyaal aayamaharashtra main shivasena bijepi ke saath sattarudh bhi he, par mauka dekh kar party ke netaa bhaajapaayiyon par aae din nishaanaa sadhate rahete hai

 sansad kaa satr khatm hue 8 din biit chuke the
 In such a situation, everyone including the Prime Minister should go on a hunger strike in front of the Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex on the same day

 Rahul Gandhi himself arrived late at the hunger strike
 anya congressiyon ne bhi anshan kaarykram ko gambhirtha se nahin liya, isliye desh bhar main unka anshan bhi haasyaaspad ban gaya

 ) desh kii sabase badi pahchaan yojana, puure desh ko 12 anko main sametane kaa sabase mahatvakankshi project
 But in this project termites of rigging and forgery are being started
 ajtak ne khulaasa kiya he ki jisamen saamne aayaa he ki kaise chand noton or voton ke liye banti ja rahi he revadiyaan
 Aadhaar cards are being made without papers, without any housing certificate
 unic identificesh card yani aadhaar card jari karne kaa kaam desh main joro shoron se chal rahaa he
 UID numbers have also been issued to about 12 crore people so far
 lekin isse pehle ki upie sarkaar kii sabase chaheti or super advanced yojana paravaan chadh paati isko lekar gambhir sawaal khadey hone shuru ho gayi hai
 This revelation will also blow your senses of how the MLA and MP in the capital Delhi are compromising with the security of the country in the matter of votes
 ajtak ko pataa chalaa ki desh kaa sabase bada pahchaan patr bina kisi pahchaan ke baanta ja rahaa he to ajtak ne khufia camere ke saath tahakikat shuru kii to ek khatarnaak tasviir saamne ai
 We learned how a foreign terrorist can easily identify himself as an Indian without any trouble
 darasal unic identification athurity of india ne aadhaar card ko banavaane ke liye zaruri kaagajaton main chhot dene kaa adhikaar sthaneey register ko de diya, jiskaa sabase galat phayda vot bank ke chakkar main sthaneey netaa uthaa rahe hai
 These people are engaged in making UID cards
 koi pahchaan patr nahin he to netaji ke ghar par bant rahe pramaan patr ke liye line main lage hai
 Netaji's spoonfuls are also busy signing and hitting
 jitna zyada pramaan patr batenge, ilaake main netaji kaa utana hi gudwil badhegaa
 Now, if we have to compromise the security of the country, who cares? darasal yuaidi card banavaane ke liye teen dastavej mukhya taur par sanlagn karne zaruri hai
 These are 1
 photo pahchaan patr, 2
 Birth date certificate, 3
 awaas pramaan patr
 In view of this, the UID Authority recognized the certificate issued by the local MLA and MP for the housing certificate, in view of the problems of the people living at the temporary address
 bas yaheen se is dhaandhlee kii shuruuaat hui
 Public representatives started issuing housing certificates on letter heads without any identification and verification
 had to ye he ki vidhayakon or saansadon ne pehle se hi latter pad par pramaan patr print kara rakh liye hai
 Long queues of people take place in the morning to get them
 bas is pritend latter head par apana pataa bhariye or ban gaya awaas pramaan patr
 The domination of this certificate in UID centers is such that the employee sitting there will not ask you any questions about your date of birth and your identity
 koi nahin jaanata ki is tareeke se pahchaan patr hasil karne waalon kii asli pahchaan kya he or is baat kii kya ganrti he ki kuch videshi ghuspaithiyon or aatankiyon ne is tareeke se aadhaar card naa hasil kar liya ho
 The most shocking truths in the messing with Aadhaar cards are the mess in the name of public representatives
 netaaon ke letters head par bina kisi poochtacha ke ban rahe hai awaas pramaan patr
 Fake signatures are being done on the letter heads of the leaders and Aadhaar cards are being made on the basis of them
 pahchaan patr banavaane kii talash main ajtak pahunchaa pashchimi dilli se saansad mahabal mishra ke nivas par
 It was seen that there is already a long line to get the identity card on the letter head of the leader
 lekin andar baithe maatahat karmchaaree jaldi kaam nipataane main lage the
 We have also got in line
 number aayaa to vahaan baithe karmchaaree ne bas hamase ek photo or pataa maanga
 We told a fake address
 lekin us shaks ne bina kisi jaanch-parakh kiye pehle se pritend latter pad par hamaara pahchaan or awaas pramaan patr taiyaar kar diya
 Immediately, the form was moved to sign and stamp on the letter
 maine ek or shaks kii photo dekar uskaa bhi farji pahchaan or awaas pramaan patr banavaa liya
 After the seal, the other person present there signed the work of MP Mahabal Mishra
 saansad mahabal mishra kaa pramaan patr lekar ham pahunch gayi yuaidi centre par
 The staff there made some arrangements and our UID card was made within minutes
 bina kisi bairiphication ke jari kiye ja rahe pramaan patr kaa sawaal jab hamane saansad mahabal mishra se poocha to unka jawaab bhi kam dilachasp nahin he
 Mahabal Mishra said, 'any citizen of India is a Hindustani
 aadhaar card se uski pramanikta hogi
 Aadhar card will identify him
 kya naam he, kya vyavsaay karata he, kahaan kaa rahane vaala he
 If we do not issue, then who will do it
 hamaara kaam ricomend karnaa he
 It is the job of a government official to investigate
 jo mere kshetra main do saal se rahata he main use jaanata hum
 Our job is to recommit
 darasal hamaare desh main koi bhi pahchaan patr farji tareeke se banvaanaa behad aam baat he or yahi samasya unic aaidentification card kii yojana kii shuruuaat karne kaa aadhaar bani
 This card, made on the basis of biometric information of any citizen, was considered a very reliable and far from fraudulent thing
 lekin desh ke harek aadmi tak pahunch banane ke chakkar main isko banane ke liye zaruri pramaan patron ko lekar behad lacheela ravaiya apanaaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, any terrorist who has infiltrated the country can easily get recognition of being Indian
 jaahir he ye desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye bada khatra he

 Haley was asked at the press conference about efforts to bring terrorists (especially terrorists from the South Asia region) under UN sanctions and how other permanent members are using veto power to stop these efforts

 Dr
 for the past year and a half
 manmohan singh dilli ke lutiuns sthit apane vishaal bangale se rajnatik paridrishy ko banataa-bigadataa dekh rahe hai
 After running the government for ten years, when he faced defeat and was replaced by Narendra Modi-led power, he was disappointed
 uske baad se bharat main jis tareeke se raaj-kaaj chal rahaa he, usase unki chintaaon main zyada ijapha hua he
 The former Prime Minister reads a lot in the free time left after meeting two visitors in the morning and in the evening
 jab ve kisi cheez ko zyada gaharaai se padhuya chaahate hai to ek sade kaagaj par kalam se nots lete hai or aise anya sroton kii talash karte hai jinase unhen ukt vishay ko samajhane main madad mil sake
 Sonia Gandhi regularly visits him
 unke bete rahul gandhi bhi kabhi-kabhaar aate hai
 Other Congress leaders also come to meet him often
 ve bataate hai ki cambridge or oxford ke puraane doston (jin sansthaanon main unhone yah janaa ki badlaav laane main raajnneeti kii kya bhoomika ho sakati he), pakistan (purv videsh mantri khurshid mahmud kasuri haal hi main yahaan aae the) yaa nepal (purv raashtrapati rambaran yadav se milane ve gaye the) yaa phir anya deshon ke mehmaanon se milakar unhen jo bauddhik khuraaq milti he, uskaa ve aajkal sukh le rahe hai
 His study room is filled with books and papers, which testify to how deeply this man has invested in the field of knowledge, so he believes that you may lose all your worldly resources — as his Also happened in 1947 during Partition - but your knowledge always stays with you

 He said something on TV after the death of Abdul Kalam) Dr
 singh ne vibhinn vishyon par khulkar baat kii he
 They are as much concerned with the fluctuations in the economy as they are concerned about the constantly changing policy of the Modi government on the issue of Pakistan
 ve maanate hai ki pradhanmantri ko desh kii sehat durust karne ke liye or bahut kuch karnaa chahie
 He expresses disappointment that the Prime Minister is not extending his hand to the main opposition party Congress
 koyala ghotaale main apane upar lage aaropon par ve bas itnaa kehete hai ki sibiai ne unhen clin chit de di he or unhen ab adaalat jane kii jarurat nahin he
 Dr
 singh na to koi kitaab likh rahe hai or na hi apane sansmaran, lekin unka is baat main majboot bharosa he ki unhone apni aguwai main desh ko jo disha di thi, itihaas uski tasadeeq karegaa
 Excerpts from the interview: What is your opinion about the way the Narendra Modi government is tackling the economy today? The economy is not as good as it could have been today, despite the conditions today being much more favorable than the Congress-led UPA rule
 
 masalan, us samay tel kii keemat 150 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai thi, jo aaj 30 dollar prati bairal ke kareeb he
 It has undoubtedly helped in bridging India's payment deficit, the current account deficit has come down, it has enabled the government to reduce the fiscal deficit, and for any objective government, it is a major step towards increasing investment
 Could have proved a good chance
 lekin aapako lagata he ki sarkaar aisa nahin kar rahi
 
 
 Whatever the reason, the government is not able to encourage the business community to take advantage of this favorable situation, which could have increased the rate of investment
 aaj nivesh kii dar 32 fisadi par aa chuki he
 When our government was at its peak it reached 35 per cent
 hamaare aakhri do saal ke dauraan isamen beshak giravat ai, lekin jaisaa maine bataaya ki hamaare samay main tel kii oonchi keemton kaa sankat tha jo philhal nahin he
 So what do you think India has missed a chance? Of course
 
 
 yaad rakhie ki ham jinson kaa vishuddh aayaat karte hai, jiskaa matlab yah hua ki unki kam keemat bharat ke liye acchhee baat he; yah bhugtan dey main madadgaar hota he; yah mudrasphiti ko niyantrit karne or vittiya ghate ko kam karne main bhi madad karata he
 Do you think why the Modi government has been unable to do this? Obviously, people do not trust the government
 sarkaar ke mantri bheetar to sahi baat karte hai lekin baahar aakar ve kehete hai ki kuch khaas badla nahin he
 Today there is a crisis of trust in the government
 jab aap pradhanmantri the, to 2008 main aap vaishvik mandi se kis tarah nibate the?hamane sabase baat kii thi, lekin aaj mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki kaarobaari samudaay ke bheetar aatmavishvaas kii kami he
 i do not understand what this is all about
 
 
 jab kaarobaari log sarkari adhikariyon se baat karte hai to afasar kehete hai ki unhen pataa hi nahin ki sarkaar ko koun chalaa rahaa he
 
 
 When we were in government, the business class used to talk a lot about tax tourism
 aaj bhi jab kaarobaari samudaay mere paas aata he to ve mujhase yahi baaten karte hai
 What should the Modi government do? First of all, we must recognize that this benefit of oil prices is not going to last long
 is sarkaar ne vaise bhi paanch main se do saal to logon main yah bharosa jagaae bagaiyr kaat die ki desh tarakkee kii raah par he
 For example, there is no change in the debt of banks - the rate of increase in the debt of banks is at a very low level compared to the better economy
 modi sarkaar ke anya ayaamon ke bare main kya raay he? sarkaar kii videsh niti ko aap kis tarah dekhte hai?badi takaton ke saath rishte beshak sudhare hai, lekin yah to hamaare daur main bhi tha
 We had very good relationships with Russia, China, Japan, America, France and Germany
 america ke saath hui parmaanu sandhi parmaanu bhedbhaav ke dushchakra ko todgaye kii ek aitihaasik koshish thi
 We worked to end isolation on the world stage of India
 meraa maananaa he ki videsh niti kaa asli imtihaan apane padosiyon se nibatane main he
 Here i would like to say that the Modi Government's attitude towards Pakistan is unstable
 yah ek kadam aage, do kadam peeche kii ranneeti rahi he
 Even in the case of Nepal, the situation is that the government there is blaming India for imposing economic blockade and it is very unfortunate
 aap aisa kyon kah rahe hai? aakhirkaar bharat kii sarkaar to yah sunishchit karnaa chaahegi ki tarai kii janata ko baaki nepaliyon ke baraabar adhikaar mili?nepal hamaara sabase kareebi padosi he or hamen is baat ko pakkaa karne kii puri koshish kerani chahie ki ek chote padosi ke naate uski dharanaon kii ham parvaah karen
 Even if they are wrong, it is our obligation to create such an environment in which the general public of Nepal feels that India is their good friend
 lekin madhesi to maanate hai ki unhen loktantric nepal main puure adhikaar nahin die gaye hai
 
 
 First of all, i believe that India should have taken its step further
 nepal ke samvidhan ko 20 sitambar, 2015 ko manjuuri di jaani thi or videsh sachiv ko isse ekaadh din pehle hi nepali sarkaar ko kadaa sandesh dene ke liye bheja gaya
 i don't think this is a very good way to deal with a difficult problem
 agar bharat ko vastav main lag rahaa tha ki samvidhan main kuch dikkat he, to use pehle hi nepaliyon ko chupchaap yah bataa dena chahie tha or unhen apane paksh main modia chahie tha
 Instead, the government woke up late
 tathy yah he ki adhiktar madhesiyon ne nepal ke samvidhan ke paksh main apana vot diya
 Therefore, the Indian government should have been more cautious about the developments in Nepal
 to kya sarkaar ko kathmandu se or kareebi samvaad bananaa chahie tha?haa
 
 
 We have always had a good relationship with Nepal and we have always used it to strengthen indo-nepal relations
 isse pehle aapane kaha tha ki pakistan ke maamle main modi sarkaar kii niti asthir he
 What do you mean by this? i cannot say that during my government our relationship with Pakistan was completely problem-free
 mere khyaal se hamaari asli chintaa aatank par niyantran kaayam karne kii he
 Pakistan has broken its promises on this front
 yah samasya ab bhi jas kii tas bani hui he
 The question is how is the Modi government reacting to this? Whatever your views on Pakistan, but our effort was to maintain dialogue with Pakistan
 ham apane doston ko to chun sakate hai, lekin apane padosiyon ko nahin
 Modi government has been behaving inconsistently in this matter
 isane aage badhkar pradhanmantri ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke liye navaj sharif ko nyotaa diya, jo acha kadam tha lekin isse jo laabh milanaa chahie tha vah nahin mila kyonki modi sarkaar ne shart rakh di ki pakistani sarkaar hurriyat se baat nahin kar sakati, isliye vaarta radd ho gai
 How should the government react to the Hurriyat case? The matter is that the Hurriyat does exist, and its presence cannot be denied, whether or not it represents the people of Jammu and Kashmir is a different question
 
 beshak ham use yah manyata nahin dete ki vah iklauti ikai he jo jackvamu or kashmir kii samasyaon se nibat sakati he
 But there is no harm in talking to him
 yahaan tak ki atalji kii sarkaar bhi unase baat kar rahi thi, ham bhi unase baatcheet kar rahe the, or hamaara paksh yahi rahaa he ki hurriyat ko pakistan kii bajaae hamase baat kerani chahie
 This is the reason why the Modi government lacks the sensitivity needed in relations with Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan par aakhri sawaal
 
 
 You were the Prime Minister at the time of the Mumbai attack
 us samay aapane pakistan se kya kaha tha?ham vaishvik samudaay ko yah bataane kii koshish kar rahe the ki yah sthiti sweekaarya nahin he, lekin main yah bhi maanata tha ki samasya kaa hal jang nahin he
 That is why our effort was to put a pressure on the global fraternity so that in return, it can put pressure on Pakistan to ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous massacre are ensured
 mujhe lagata he ki ham is maamle main kaamyaab bhi rahe
 i think the world understood that Pakistan could not shed its footing by saying that it had nothing to do with the Mumbai incident
 kya america ne yah maan liya tha ki pakistan kaa haath mumbai hamale main tha?mujhe nahin lagata ki america ne kabhi aisa kuch kaha ho, lekin ve yah jarur maan chuke the ki mumbai hamale kaa strot beshak pakistan main tha
 In such a situation, why could the global community not pressurize Pakistan to take any action against the culprits of the Mumbai attack? Unfortunately, terror in relations with India has been a part of Pakistan's policy
 saath hi hamen yah bhi maan lenaa chahie ki ham donon parmaanu shakti sampann desh hai
 Pakistan is now accumulating strategic nuclear weapons
 isiilie aap unhen sabak sikhaane ke liye unke saath jang kii baat halake main nahin kar sakate
 We must create an environment in which the people of Pakistan themselves realize that their government is not working in the interests of both countries
 
 
 pakistan ne aksar aatank ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa vaada kiya he, samasya sirf yah he ki vah apana vaada puraa nahin kar paata
 What do you think of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's sudden visit to Lahore? i don't think that was a deliberate move
 is baat ke koi sakshya nahin hai ki pakistan ne pathankot hamale ke doshiyon ke khilaaf koi karrwai kii ho
 i had read an article by famous Pakistani journalist Ayesha Siddiq who went to jaish-e-mohammed's headquarters in Bahawalpur, when there was a cry that Pakistan had taken any action against Jaish
 unhone likhaa ki unhen koi bhi asaamaanya gatividhi dikhaai nahin di
 The madrasa in which Jaish is headquartered was functioning as before and everything seemed normal
 ab yah baat saamne aa rahi he ki pakistan puch rahaa he-jaisaa vah hameshaa kahata rahaa he&ki aap hamen paryaapt saboot muhaiyaa nahin kara rahe
 i think history in Pathankot is repeating itself
 lekin pradhanmantri kii lahore yatra kya acha kadam nahin thi?apane padosiyon se sambandh banaae rakhana hameshaa acchhee baat hoti he, lekin ise lekar sansani paidaa karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 If you have no idea of the outcome of your action, then i am going to know your strength
 isiilie mujhe nahin lagata ki pradhanmantri ne iske bare main bahut sochaa-vichaara tha
 
 
 He said that he was in Kabul while talking to Nawaz Sharif, when he invited
 aise samvedansheel rishte par, khaskar bharat or pakistan ke maamle main kadam uthaane kaa yah koi suniyojit tarika nahin he
 But Modi was following you, that is, breakfast in Kabul, lunch in Lahore and dinner in Delhi? (cutting in between)
 
 
 haa, lekin vah sirf hamaari aakanksha thi
 If i was not sure that any meaningful result would come, i would not have put all the pressure on going to Pakistan
 agar koi nateeja hi na nikle, to koshish bekaar ho jaati he
 You are compromising your ability to deal with the problem
 lekin aap 2007 main pakistan kii yatra kii taiyaari takreeban kar chuke the?nahin, bilkul nahin
 There was a discussion about whether you wanted to go to your ancestral village of Gah
 iskaa nyotaa tha, vaada tha or kuch shuruaati yojanaayen bhi bani thim, lekin maine koi faisla is bare main nahin kiya tha, jab tak ki main kisi thos nattejey se aashwast nahin ho jaataa, jo yah tha ki mumbai hamale ke doshiyon par karrwai ho or pakistan apni jameen kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf aatanki hamalon ke liye kiye jane se roke
 The discussion was that preparations for your tour in Gah were already done
 
 
 sarkaar se jude maamalon main aap khub bhavanaaen rakhie, lekin aap bhavuk nahin ho sakate
 i would definitely like to go to my village, but it would be more than just a tour
 kashmir par apane back-channel samvaad ke bare main kuch bataaie, jo ki dashakon se sabase zyada shashakt rahaa
 Why did you start this conversation? That is because i have always believed that India's policy should give primacy to relations with neighbors and we have to learn to communicate with him despite all his actions in the case of Pakistan
 kabhi yah kargar hota he, kabhi nahin bhi
 But if we believe that we are the biggest force in this region, then we cannot avoid saying that it is impossible to deal with Pakistan
 donon paksh jis chaar sutreey formule par kaam kar rahe the, uskaa kya hua?purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne iske bare main likhaa he, lekin main yah nahin kahuunga ki main uski pushti kar rahaa hum
 There was a back channel dialogue and it was heading in the right direction
 iskaa uddeshy bharat-pakistan sambandh ko saamaanya karnaa tha
 The solution of Kashmir which was put forth in the Simla Agreement, should be implemented by the efforts of both the countries
 hamaara paksh yah tha ki sarahadein dobaaraa nahin banaai ja sakati hai
 If this is the case, then you will have to find other ways to deal with the problem that can satisfy the people of India and Pakistan including Jammu and Kashmir
 to niyantran rekha (elosi) kaa kya hoga?niyantran rekha apni jagah he, ham use dobaaraa nahin bana sakate, lekin jammu-kashmir main halaat saamaanya kar ke ham aisa maahaul bana sakate hai jahaan yah rekha vyaavhaarik rup se apraasangik ho jaae
 As i thought, the people of Jammu and Kashmir on both sides should be allowed to do business with each other, have free movement, they can work together to deal with the river and similar environmental issues and a process of consultation By means of dealing with similar problems in which both sides are represented
 yah pakistan par atal bihari vaajapeyi kii soch se mail khaataa dikhataa he
 
 
 Yes, i proceeded the same process
 mujhe lagata he ki us disha main paryaapt pragati hui thi, lekin mumbai hamale ne ise avaruddh kar diya
 
 
 As far as the Modi government is concerned, i cannot advise them, but it is for them to decide that they want to continue treating Pakistan in the same clumsy way as they have done in the last 18 months
 aaj jammu-kashmir ke halaat par aap kya sochate hai jahaan raashtrapati shashan lagu he?rajya main jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he, uski sanyukt jimmedaari bijepi or pidipi kii he
 The central government has not been able to instill that much confidence in the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 mere khyaal se pidipi ab is baat ko mahasoos kar rahi he ki bijepi ke saath uske rishte ko aam kashmiriyon kaa samarthan nahin tha
 They wish to come into the government but they are also afraid that if people lose their confidence in them, then they will be at a disadvantage in the coming times
 isiilie meraa maananaa he ki yah centre sarkaar or bijepi kii jimmedaari he ki ve aisa upunnt maahaul banaaen jisamen pidipi ko is rishte ke saath aage badaae main koi dikkat na aane paae
 Mehbooba Mufti is like your daughter
 unhen aap kya salaah dena chahenge?main nahin jaanata ki bijepi or pidipi ke bich is samay kaisaa rishta he, lekin mere kchayaal se yah donon dalon ke hit main hoga or desh ke bhi hit main hoga ki kashmir main kaam karne vaali ek kaayade kii sarkaar ho
 Whatever needs to be done to run this government properly will have to be done
 rashtriya raajnneeti par waapas aate hue yah poochna chaahuungi ki 2014 ke chunaav main itane baari bahumat se jab modi sarkaar ai or congress kii itani buree haar hui, tab aapako kaisaa laga?main bahut dukhi tha ki congress kii itani buree haar hui
 i think we had done a lot to win back the trust of the people, but there were problems and the BJP overshadowed us in giving direction to the perception of the people here
 aapaki raay main bijepi ne beete dedh saal main kaisaa pradarshan kiya he? desh main ashishnutaa par khub bahes hui he
 
 
 This perception is becoming stronger that the BJP has failed to fulfill the areas it had made big promises
 pradhanmantri vikaas kii baat karte hai lekin vruddhi dar hamaare kaarykaal jitani hi bani hui he or koi khaas antar nahin aayaa he
 Growth rate in the last year of our term 6
 9 fisadi thi jabaki haalia aankade dikhaate hai ki yah 7 se 7
 Hovering between 2 percent
 bhugtan dey main paryaapt sudhaar ke baavjood arthvyavastha aage nahin bad rahi he, jo sab kii aakanksha thi or jise lekar sarkaar ne vaade kiye the
 Do you think issues related to intolerance have distracted the Prime Minister's attention? For example, the ban on beef and the killing of a Muslim in Uttar Pradesh because people believed that beef was kept in his house
 
 
 ye sab samasyaayein hai
 The people of our country hope that the Prime Minister will take the lead in shaping the public perception, but he did not say anything on any issue, whether it is a ban on beef or events in Muzaffarnagar etc
 ve lagaataar chup hai
 What do you think, why do they do this? i don't know, i can't read their mind
 lekin ve bharat kii samoochee janata ke pradhanmantri hai isliye unhen har bhartiya ko yah vishwaas dilaanaa chahie ki unke rup main hamen ek aisa pradhanmantri mila he jo hamaare kalyaan kaa khyaal rakhata he
 Critics of the Prime Minister say that one of the reasons for his silence is that he has been an old RSS volunteer
 
 
 atalji bhi to the, lekin unhone kaam se siikhaa
 They have a majority in the Lok Sabha
 
 
 ek uddeshypurna sarkaar or samajhadaar netritv ke haath main is vakt baari avasar hai jisase ve arthvyavastha ke prabandhan main tarakkee kar sakate hai or saamaajik tanaavon ko tham sakate hai
 Do you think that the Prime Minister has been able to have enough dialogue with the main opposition party Congress in Parliament? i have had the opportunity to talk to the Prime Minister a few times and i have told him that he will have to move towards the opposition more effectively
 videsh niti ho yaa gharelu niti, yahaan tak ki jiesti par bhi congress ke saath koi gambhir charchaa nahin kii gai he
 
 
 There was no serious discussion on GST? Yes, except that Jaitleyji (union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley) came and invited me and Soniaji to get their daughter married
 mukhya vipakshi party ke saath rishte kaayam karne kaa yah tarika sarkaar ko shobhaa thode detaa he
 But the Prime Minister also invited both of you to have tea at the beginning of the last session? Jaitleyji did all the talks there as well, the Prime Minister kept quiet
 unhone pehle bhi mujhe bulaayaa tha
 If the Prime Minister has called me, i felt that it should be my duty to meet him
 to main unase milane gaya
 At that time also i had told him that if you want to improve the relationship with the Congress party, it has become more necessary now than ever that you establish contact with the leadership of the Congress, especially Soniaji and Rahulji
 maine unhen kaha ki yah kaam main nahin kar saktaa
 He is the two most important leaders of the party and if the government does not maintain good relations with Soniaji and Rahulji, then you cannot take the Congress Party lightly
 aisa nahin ho saktaa ki aap neshnal herold jaise maamle uchhaalate rahen or phir ye ummid karen ki
 
 
 What did the Prime Minister say to you in response? He kept listening continuously, but he did not say anything on his behalf
 us baithak main unhone mujhase poocha, “pakistan ke saath kya kiya janaa chahie?” maine unase kaha ki is rishte par aapke vichaar chaahe jo bhi hon, hamen pakistan ke saath samvaad sthapit karnaa chahie
 Dialogue does not mean that we agree with Pakistan on everything
 
 
 maine unhen bataaya ki cuba ke missile sankat ke dauraan america or soviet sangh ek-duusare ko phooti aankh nahin suhate the lekin unhone baatcheet kabhi bhi band nahin kii
 Recently, on the occasion of 75th birthday of Sharad Pawar, when i was exiting the program, the Prime Minister also got out
 unhone mujh se kaha, “pakistan ke maamle main ham aapaki di hui salaah par hi amal kar rahe hai
 "(smiling) Dr
 singh, ve aapako shrey de rahe the?jo ho, mujhe nahin lagata ki ve aisa kabhi saarvajanik rup se kahenge
 But the fact is that even after the Pathankot attack, the talks have not stopped
 
 
 haa, dekhte hai baat kahaan tak pahunchati he
 The problem is that situations are always complicated in Pakistan, there are many players, such as his army, which is very powerful
 haalanki sansad main yah bahut saaf hota gaya he ki satta or vipakshi dal ke sadsy ek-duusare se bamushkil hi baat karte hai
 For democracy, it is not good for the country
 donon pakshon ke bich bematlab kaa manmutav he
 It should not happen
 aapako kya lagata he ki yah manmutav kyon he?kyonki sattadhari party ko is baat kaa ehsaas nahin he ki use desh chalaane ke liye congress kii jarurat he
 One last question about all the scams in the last years of your government, such as the CWG, 2G or the coal scam
 kya aapako bura lagata he ki aapke aakhri varshon par in chizon kii chaaya rahi?un dinon ke bare main mujhe vaaki afsos hota he ki sieji kii report kaa istemaal vipaksh ne sansad kii kaarywahi ko baadhit karne main kiya
 The cag's reports should have been debated in the Loklekha Committee, but the day the report was published, the BJP raised the matter in Parliament and the Parliament came to a standstill
 hamaare paas kabhi mauka hi nahin rahaa ki ham bataa pate ki asal main hua kya tha
 Parliament has never been spared the chance that it would be able to take stock of the situation in a neutral manner and this has always bothered me
 aapke man main use lekar kadavaahat he?mere man main kisi cheez ko lekar kadavaahat nahin he, lekin dukh jarur hota he
 i did not come to politics to make money for myself, my family or friends
 isiilie mujhe bahut bura laga or dukh hua jab bijepi ke sadsy sadan ke wel main aakar naaraa lagaate the, “pradhanmantri chor he
 "it hurt me a lot
 kya isiilie aap kah rahe the ki “itihaas mere saath nyaay karegaa?”haa, meraa isamen bharosa he
 i am sure this will happen

 ' congress uttar pradesh main apni jaden jamaane ke liye apane paramparaagat brahman vot kii taraf lautne kii taiyaari kar lee he
 State Congress Committee President Raj Babbar has resigned from his post
 haalanki unka istipha abhi sweekaar nahin hua he
 Despite this, the high command has made up its mind to hand over the command of the party in the hands of the Brahmin community
 soobe ke siyaasi sameekaran main feet nahin raaj babbarcongress kii kaman rahul gandhi ke haathon main aane ke baad se uttar pradesh main congress adhyaksh raaj babbar kii vidaai tay maani ja rahi thi
 Raj Babbar did not fit into the changing political equation of the state
 pradesh kii raajnneeti phir ek baar jaateey samikarnon kii taraf lautati dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, Raj Babbar's departure from the post of state president was decided
 jabaki raaj babbar ne pichley ek saal ke apane kaarykaal main jamkar mehnat kii
 But due to the caste politics of the state, they could not strengthen the Congress
 pradesh adhyaksh pad se ab jab raaj babbar ne istipha de diya he, to unhen rahul gandhi kii team main nai jimmedaari di ja sakati he
 Until Raj Babbar's resignation from the Congress leadership is approved, he will continue working as state president

 The Congress is ready to capitalize on this resentment of Brahmins
 raaj babbar ke baad upi congress kii kaman brahman samudaay ke haathon main die jane kii party ne yojana banaai he
 In the race for the state president, the party has made complete preparations to hand over the command of the Congress to the Brahmin leader in place of Raj Babbar

 He had also reached Rajya Sabha with the help of SP

 In the last session of Parliament, the GST Constitution Amendment Bill was not allowed to be passed by Congress due to its demand that the Constitution Amendment Bill should not mention the non-revenue rate exceeding 18 per cent
 saath hi congress jiesti dar ke upar rajyon ko ek pratishat atirikt kar lagane ke bhi khilaaf he

 sansad kii kaarywahi main vyavdhaan ke chalate vastu evam seva kar vidheyak (jiesti) par vichaar karne evam use paarit karne main vilamb ho rahaa he
 The bill provides for a uniform indirect tax system in the entire country

 The Congress vice-president said, these are the three main structural differences

 The Congress is happy inside this structure, we have already said and will be happy to push the GST forward

 praadhikaran ne aaj kaha ki google kii ek galati se uskaa (praadhikaran kaa) purana helpline number 18003001947 kai mobile phone upyogkartaaon kii kantact list main aa gaya tha
 Rumors spread and tried to tarnish Aadhaar's image

 isaliye is number ko mitaane main koi dar nahin hona chahie kyonki isse koi nuksaan nahin he
 If people want, they can replace the new helpline number 1947 of UIADI instead
 gauratlab he ki france kaa sibar suraksha visheshgy hone kaa daawa karne vaale ek twitor yujar ne pichley saptaah twit kar is afvaah ko janm diya tha

 is hafte ek or film 'chaar sahibazaade-rising of banda singh bahadur' bhi relies hui he jo ek 3D anemation film he
 It is a sequel to the 2014 film 'char Sahibzade' which was well appreciated at the time
 iske sikval main ab aage kii kahani he jahaan sikhon ke dasven guru mughalon se loha lene ke liye bandaa singh kaa chayan karte hai or phir kis tarah bandaa singh punjab ko mughalon ke zulm se azaadi dilaate hai
 The film is also a 3D film and has been composed by Ompuri as the narrator
 is film kii khaasiyat he iskaa anemation or iskaa sangeet
 i liked the animation of it, which makes 3D technology more interesting, this story from the pages of history keeps you hooked
 film kaa imoshan or ection aapako ehsaas nahin hone detaa ki aap ek anemation film dekh rahe hai, is film main jo thodi kami mujhe lagi vah he iskaa screenple kyonki film jab bhi flash back main jaati he aap thodaa ulajh jate hai or kahani par halkaa sa brake lag jaataa he or phir aapako yaad karnaa padataa he ki aap flash back main hai or abhi waapas aae hai
 According to me, all those who know or do not know about this part of history should see this film
 mujhe yah film acchhee lagi or main duungaa is film ko 3
 5 stars yah film bhi ek 3D film he or isamen bataur sutaradhar awaz di he ompuri ne
 The specialty of this film is its animation and its music
 mujhe iskaa anemation acha laga jise 3D takanic or adhik rochak banaati he, itihaas ke pannon se nikali yah kahani aapako baandhe rakhti he
 The emotion and action of the film does not let you realize that you are watching an animation film, the only thing that i found lacking in this film is its screenplay because whenever the film goes into flashback you get a little confused and a bit light on the story The brakes break and then you have to remember that you are in the flash back and have just returned
 mere hisaab se jin logon ko itihaas ke is hisse ke bare main pataa he yaa jinhe nahin maaloom un sabhi ko yah film dekhni chahie
 i liked this film and i will give this film 3
 5 stars

 vaise bhi in dinon kapil biimaar hai
 Going to Vancouver to treat back pain, different actors will get the opportunity to do one episode each instead of Kapil, which is also an experiment in itself

 ' Apart from Kader Khan in the film, Om Puri, Rajpal Yadav, Sanjay Mishra, Amita Nangia, Razzaq Khan, Amit j and Danish Bhatt, the film is directed by Fauzia Arshi
 nirdesan ke alaava fauzia ne film sangeet diya he
 This film by Kadar Khan, 'ho Gaya Brain Ka Dahi', is full of comedy according to its title
 amitabh bachchan ne twitor par khabar dete hue kaha ki, 'kadar khan or film kii puri team ko ham dher sari shubhakamanaayen dete hai
 ' kadar khan kii ye film 'ho gaya dimaag kaa dahi' apane tital ke hisaab se puri tarah kamedi se bharpoor he

 ' On Monday, just like Home Minister Amit Shah proposed to remove Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha, there was a flood of advertisements selling land in Jammu and Kashmir on social media
 daawa kya he?fasebuk or whatsap par aise tamaam messej aa rahe hai jisamen srinagar ke laalchowk jaise ilaake main sasti daron par 11 se 14 lakh main jameen bechney kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 What is the truth? India Today anti-fake News War Room found the claims to be misleading
 haalanki sarkaar kii nai pahal ke baad ab desh kaa koi bhi naagarik kashmir main jameen jaaydaad kharid saktaa he lekin jo vigyaapan soshal media par dikh rahe hai wo sab farji hai
 One such message was written 'book your land on Lal Chowk Road in Kashmir 11
 25 lakh main jiesti ke saath
 370 has been removed in Kashmir
 limited stock ! zyada jaankaree ke liye kol karen 9019292918
 "when we called on this number, this number was found by a company doing business of land in Kolkata" Eden Realty "
 company kii website ke mutabik ye rajya sarkaar ke saath milakar kai project par kaam kar rahi he
 Company employees said that the message issued in their name is fake
 " kisi ne jaanboojhkar hamaare saath majaak kiya he hamane is bare main pashchim bengal police kii sibar cell ko soochna de di he
 You are requested to not trust this message "facebook user Avinash Singh also sent a similar message and also gave a number in it
 jab hamane phone kiya to paaya ki ye number khud avinaash kaa tha
 He described himself as a BJP worker and said that he had written this post as a joke, as well as he said that the days are not far when people will be able to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir
 kya jameen khareednaa mumkin he?centre sarkaar ne 1954 ke raashtrapati ke aadesh ko ek gajet notification ke jariye radd kar diya he
 Now article 35A will end
 artical 35 a ke tahat jammu kashmir ke washindon ko vahaan kaa sthaayee nivasee mana jaataa tha
 Under this law, no outsider could be a permanent resident there, even if the daughter married a boy from outside his state, his right was also taken away
 ab 35 e khatm ho jaayegaa or usee ke saath kashmir kaa vishesh rajya kaa darja bhi samaapt ho jayega
 Now any citizen of the country will be free to buy land here and stay here permanently
 lekin maujuuda kanoon vyavastha ki haalat dekhte hue ye kahana thik hoga ki philhal aisa hota nahin dikhataa or turant vahaan koi jameen kharid paaya aisa bhi mumkin nahin he
 Conclusion The messages related to selling land in Jammu and Kashmir are fake
 anuchhed 370 ke khatm hone ke baad kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm ho jayega or kanoonee taur par koi bhi jameen kharidne ke liye aaazaad hoga
 However, given the current situation, it would be fine to say that this work may take some time

 In view of the cash crunch after the note closure and the salary week has started, banks are advised that more and more people can avoid the queue by using prepaid cash card
 desh main 8 oktober se shuru hui notebandi ke baad auto chaalak se lekar chote-mote dukandaar tak petm or uske tamaam vikalpon kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 In such a situation, a prepaid card issued by companies is the best option where you can avoid cash shortage for your needs
 jaaniye kya he preeped card or kaise yah dur kar saktaa he cash kii killat-1
 In order to save the long queue in the salary week that has started in the country, banks have advised many big companies of the country to give some part of the salary to their employees through prepaid card
 2
 a few days ago, in view of the scarcity of cash in many government and non-government institutions, a series of advance salary was started
 ab sarkaar maan rahi he ki isse cash kii dikkat or gambhir ho sakati he lihaaja sarkari sansthaanon main cash dene par pabandi laga di thi
 Now the government is trying to give prepaid card instead of cash
 3
 According to RBI, in the first week of December, they are getting only 35-40% of the cash required by banks to distribute salary
 aisi sthiti main cash ke bharose baithna mahaj pareshaani kaa sabab he
 Therefore, a part of the salary from the companies in the form of prepaid cards can be used for necessary domestic purchases
 4
 Prepaid card is different from debit card and credit card you already have
 debit or credit card aapke bank khate se judaa rahata he or isse hui sabhi kharidari aapke bank statement kaa hissaa rahata he
 The prepaid card is not linked to your bank account
 ise istemaal karne ke liye aapako apane debit card yaa credit card se richarge karnaa hota he
 5
 preeped card aap apane selary acount vaale bank se praapt kar sakate hai
 In this card, you can also choose to transfer your partial or full salary
 kisi debit card kii tarah is card kaa istemaal aap apni sabhi kharidari athwa atm se paise nikaalane ke liye kar sakate hai
 6
 aap apni company se bhi is card ko praapt kar sakate hai
 Your company can pay some part of the salary through a payroll prepaid card
 haalanki koi company aapako yah card lene ke liye baadhya nahin kar sakati he
 7
 debit card kii tarah preeped cardko bhi istemaal karne main bank aapse tranjaction charge vasuulata he
 You can use this prepaid card by a member of your family or whomever you refer
 8
 This card becomes unsafe so that anyone can use it
 is card ke kho jane kaa sthiti main aapkaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 But if you inform your bank immediately after the disappearance of the card, then you can avoid loss
 aamtaur par yah card insurd rahata he
 9 To use this card safely, banks are advised to now transfer only the money required
 zyaadaatar preeped card ko maheene main kai baar aap apane bank acount se paise transfar kar richarge kar sakate hai
 10
 is card ko aap apni jarurat ke hisaab se paribhaashit bhi kar sakate hai
 Due to this feature, many governments use it to make their employees do certain tasks
 vahiin companiyaan bhi apane karmchaaree ko yah card dekar apni kai jaruraton ko puraa karti he
 For example, the company can give you different cards for hotel stops, meals, travel and taxis
 isse in cardon se sirf vahi kaam kiya ja saktaa he jiske liye ise paribhaashit kiya gaya he

 Reliance Jio phone is Rs 1,500 which is a feature phone, it does not run whatsapp
 haalanki isaki effective keemat 0 rupee he
 Most users of the Jio phone want to run whatsapp on it
 whatsap chalaane ke liye yugers kii deewangi is kadar he aap ise ek udhaaharan se samaj sakate hai
 a person posted a video on youtube in which he told how you can run whatsapp in a live phone
 phir kya tha, jeeyo phone yugers ne teji se us website ko acces karnaa shuru kar diya
 The situation got so much traffic on that website that the founder of the website understood that the doss attack has taken place
 Browserling naam kii ek america website he jo cross broujar testing tul uplabdh karaati he
 That is, if you want to test a version of Android by opening whatsapp or any website in Android, you can do it
 yahaan oparating system jaise Windows 7 yaa Windows 10 par yaa alag alag broujar par website testing kar sakate hai
 Peter Crummins is the creator of this website and has written a blog post
 unhone is blog main puri kahani bataai he ki kaise jeeyo phone yugers ne jeeyo phone par whatsap yuj karne ke liye wo sab kiya jo unhone yugers se karaayaa
 He said that when he came to know that his website was being accessed by millions of people from India, then he found out what is the matter
 jab unhen pataa chalaa ki ek saste feechar phone main log whatsap yuj karne ke liye unki website kaa sahaara le rahe hai to wo hairaan rah gaye, kyonki unki website isliye thi hi nahin
 Seeing the discomfort of Jio phone users using whatsapp, they have made up their mind to joke with the users
 unhone kaha he, ‘bharat ke jeeyo phone yugers free whatsap yuj karne ke liye kaise bhi twit karne ke liye taiyaar the or unhone aisa kiya bhi’pehle unhone india se aane vaale trephic ko bain karne kii sochi, lekin baad main unhone is broujar main jeeyo phone yugers ke liye ek opshan jod diya or kaha gaya ki aap brouseraling ke bare main twitor par twit karen
 People listened to him and in a matter of time he got lakhs of followers on Twitter
 unhone kaha ki yugers ne meri har baat maani or jo manekaha use unhone twitor par twit kiya
 In view of this, he jokingly asked the users to tweet and tweet browserling by writing Taiwan's number-1 browser
 is baar bhi jeeyo phone yugers ne lakhon twit kiye
 However, Twitter realized that this was spam and Twitter blocked all tweets in the name of Browserling
 unhone apane blog main likhaa he, ‘aisa dekh kar main hans hans kar pagal ho gaya or farsh par lotane laga’iske baad unhone logon se apane fasebuk pej ko pholo karne ko kaha or yugers ne aisa hi kiya
 However, this time his aim was to provide this feature to the users which they were looking for
 kuch samay tak majaak karne ke baad unhone yugers ke bare main sochaa or is par unhone ghanton kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 He interacted with some people in India and found out that the Jio phone users here will not pay to use the website and want to use it for free
 isliye unhone bharat katate local pemento system kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kiya
 He has said that he worked for two weeks to run whatsapp in live phone through browserling
 sabase pehle unhone ek registration pej taiyaar kiya jisamen sin ap kaa opshan tha
 Through this, information about users was sought
 jaise hi unhone ise launch kiya hajaaron logon ne sin ap karnaa yani is par acount bananaa shuru kar diya
 For this, they specially designed a new version browser which can process thousands of requests simultaneously
 ab log jeeyo phone se whatsap yuj kar rahe the brouseraling ke sahare lekin ab unhone paaya ki ab iske bare main koi share nahin kar rahaa he or naa hi twitor par unke faulors bad rahe hai
 People are using it free and they do not see any benefit, so they designed a laundry system
 lotry system banane makasad ye tha ki logon kowhatsap yuj karne mauka diya jayega
 If you win in this, then only you can use whatsapp
 agar aapako lotry ke jariye is broujar kaa sahaara lete hue whatsap yuj karne kaa chance chahie to aapako iske bare main twit karnaa hoga
 Despite this, people tweeted about it and thousands of people are using whatsapp by winning it through lottery
 unhone kaha he ki log iske liye unka shukriya bhi adaa kar rahe hai
 Now they have launched the payment system so that people can give money to use it and now the money can be given only in rupees
 baqayda is broujar se whatsap yuj karne ke liye plan taiyaar kiya gaya he
 To use one day, you will have to pay 9 rupees for this and 39 rupees for a week

 Yashwant Sinha first questioned the economy, then Arun Jaitley retaliated
 jetali ne kaha ki kuch log 80 saal kii umr main job ke liye applai kar rahe hai
 Now Yashwant Sinha has again attacked Jaitley
 unhone kaha ki 'agar main naukari kaa aavedak hota, to shaayad wo (arun jetali) pehle number par naa hote'
 The most important thing that he said during this time was that if his political career of his son Jayant Sinha is damaged due to this controversy, then he does not even care about it
 bete ke kariyar par ye bole yashavanth sinhgarun jetali ko jawaab dete hue yashavanth sinha ne kaha, 'agar ye rashtriya hit kaa vishay he, to baaki sabhi hit chote ho jate hai
 And if there is any loss from it (related to the political career of the son) then of course
 ' unhone ye bhi kaha ki is vishay main bete jayant se koi charchaa nahin hui he

 ponti ke dost or uttarakhand alpsankhyak ayog ke purv chairman sukhdev singh namdhari police radar se gaayab ho gaye hai
 The Delhi Police is investigating Namdhari's role in the entire murder
 namdhari hi is cese ke shikayatakarta bhi hai, unke is tarah se gaayab hone se yah hatyakand or bhi ulajhata najar aa rahaa he

 It is believed that Namdhari definitely has some secret which is questioning his presence there
 shanivaar ko ponti chaddha or unke bhai kii aapas main hui golibari ke dauraan maut ho gai thi
 By the way, despite many days of this shooting incident, the police have not yet been able to clearly know the sequence of incident
 aise main police kab puri sajeesh kaa pataa lagaaegi or kab tak saare gunaahagaar uski giraft main honge, ye koi nahin jaanata
 Meanwhile, a team of Delhi Police, who arrived in Bajpur, Uttarakhand in search of Namdhari, has detained some people of Namdhari and also recovered weapons from them

 Due to this audit, about 20 sarpanches in the state have been separated from the scheme so far
 haalanki panchayat chunaav se thik pehle mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne sarpanchon kii naaraazgi se bachane ke liye soshal audit band kar diya tha
 But the question of lacquer is whether the campaign against corruption should be stopped in front of the strength of sarpanches

 After this, the police came into action and nabbed sticks to control the crowd

 On the loudspeaker from the stage, the crowd pleaded not to stone and sit properly, but the crowd did not listen

 a large number of security forces personnel rushed to the spot and beat many people by lathi-charging several rounds

 After this, feeling insecure, the actor appealed to the crowd not to throw stones and sit in peace
 lekin bheed kii naaraazgi or police kii kami dekh khesari laal ne manch par parform karne se hi manaa kar diya
 When CO City Sushil Kumar Singh assured him of safety, he started a song, but the crowd again became uncontrollable

 gussai bheed bairicading tod unki taraf badi hi thi ki unhen buree tarah pasinaa aa gaya
 The police somehow rescued the terrified MLA from the crowd by taking him to his security cordon

 After this, they hurriedly escaped their lives and escaped with the police on the way back
 mahotsav main chal rahe eent-pathar se darshak is kadar sihar gaye ki paas hone ke baavjood unhen apni jaan bachaakar kaarykram chhodkar bhaagane main hi bhalaai najar ai
 When the program was discussed with the people leaving the program midway, Durgesh Kumar said that seeing the stones, bottles and chairs moving here, the police also lathi-charged, in which many people got injuries
 isiilie ham bich main hi bhaag aae
 Manish Kumar Verma had come to see and hear Khesari Lal with his family, but the stone-pelting here made him nervous that he left the program and ran towards home
 manish ne bataaya ki reeta bahuguna joshi or bhojpuri superstar khesari laal yadav donon ke hi kaarykram main inten, pathar or kya-kya nahin chale
 It is difficult to say how many people got hurt in the crowd

 Cabinet Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi became enraged after seeing a large crowd at the event

 Once again the elections are being held in the state and BJP may have to face anti-incumbency wave in it, but there are five factors which if done then will not prevent the Congress from occupying the throne of power for the sixth consecutive time

 About 16 percent of the Patidar voters are in the state
 2015 main hardik patel ke netritv main chale aarakshan andolan ke baad patidaar bijepi se naaraaz maane ja rahe hai
 Today the situation is that if Hardik Patel is negotiating with the Congress, then the Patidar Reservation Conflict Committee (PASS) has gone with the BJP
 iske alaava hardik kadava patel hai jabaki gujarat main leuva patel vot zyada hai, jo philhal bijepi ke saath hai
 BJP state president Jeetu Bagani is also Leuva Patel

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described himself as a backward class
 iske alaava haal hi main raashtrapati bane ramnath kovind bhi jis jati se aate hai, wo gujarat main obisi samudaay main shaamil he

 After the implementation of GST, the Narendra Modi government was most criticized by the traders of Gujarat

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that there are some technical problems which will be overcome gradually

 This has calmed the anger of the traders of Gujarat

 aise main gujarat ke prabharee banane ke teen din ke andar unhone khud kaa ye twit delit kar virodhiyon ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 Gujarat BJP has made it an issue and said that the ideology of Congress is anti Narmada

 Hence, there cannot be a better deal for India

 It is estimated that only 825 hectares of land will be acquired for the entire project
 ahmedabad or mumbai ke liye pehali bullate train japan se aaayaatit hogi or uske baad kii trainen bharat main hi banaai jaaengi
 This meant that Make in India would be promoted under the Bullet Train Project

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Film Name: a Death in the Ganjadirector: Konkona Sen Sharmastar Cast: Om Puri, Vikrant Massey, Kalki Koechlin, Gulshan Devaiah, Tilottama Showtime: 1 hour 48 minutescertification: a Rating: 3
 5 stardo baar neshnal aword jeet chukin actress konkana sensharma ne diarection main bhi haath aajamaaya he
 In 2006, he directed the Bengali film 'namkaroon' and now in 2017, his first Hindi film 'A Death in the Ganj' as a director has been released
 jaanate hai, aakhir kisi bani he ye film
 
 
 Story: This story dates back to the winter of 1979, when a family went to mcluskiganj in Bihar to celebrate Christmas
 parivaar main betaa nandu (gulshan devaiyaa), uski wif boni (tilottama shom), beti tani (aryaa sharma ) or kagin brother shyaamalaal chatarji urf shutu (vikrant massi) hai
 The twist in the story begins when family members are misguided by ghosts
 REVIEW: sachin: e billian drims- ek khilaadi ne 'bhagwaan' banakar kaise joda deshkahani main boni kii dost mimi (kalki kochalin) or saath hi nandu ke dost vikram (ranvir shouri) or bryan (gym sarbh) bhi shaamil hote hai
 By the time the holiday ends, a lot of things have changed
 ghar ke mukhiya o pi bakshi (om puri) or anupama (tanuja) kaa bhi ahm kirdaar he
 After all, you have to watch the film to know what the film gets
 kyon dekhen film:- film kii sabase acchhee khaasiyat yah he ki isamen jitne bhi kirdaar hai sabhi kaa koi na koi ahm role he, jisaki vajah se ek hi kahani main vividhta najar aati he
 - There are many moments in the film which are remembered till the end
 jaise- kabddi match yaa phir shikaar par janaa yaa phir do kirdaaron ke bich main alag-alag tarah ke sanvaadon kaa aadan-pradaan hona
 - According to the acting in the film, each actor has performed well
 vikrant massi jo haal hi main 'half garlfriend' main najar aae the, film main unki acting jabardast he
 - The location of the film, camera work, cinematography as well as the sound is amazing
 isi ke saath konkana sen sharma ke diarection kii bhi tarif kerani banati he
 Half Girlfriend Review: Chetan Bhagat does not have every novel to make a film, weak links: - There are many scenes in the film which have loop holes
 screen play ke dauraan yadi unpar zyada kaam kiya gaya hota to film kisi or level kii hoti
 - The pace of the film is also very weak, which could have been given special attention and crisp editing was needed
 box offis:film kaa bajet kaaphi kam he or ise kai film samarohon main pehle hi dikhaaya ja chukaa he
 Where it has also been appreciated
 gharelu furniture, plastic ke dibbe, mulaayam khilone yaa chaate banane ke liye arabon dollars ke nivesh kii jarurat nahin hoti
 No patented technology is needed to make colorful Diwali bulbs, fans or watches
 duniya ke kisi desh main samsung, microsoft, ambani, cimens, tata, adani, soni yaa unke samakaksh pataakhe, crockeri, tauliye, pen, calculator aadi nahin banaate
 Not even in China, which we used to live on this Diwali
 duniya ke prayek bade mulk kii tarah china main bhi in chizon kaa nirmaan choti ikaiyaan hi karti hai
 These small growth factories are the global strength of Made in China, while on the other side is our grand Make in India, which could not spare the small units power, even business respect
 beete saptaah bharat main pataakhaa krantikari jis samay soshal networkon par bataa rahe the ki kis tarah bharat main maid in china lattu-pataakhon ke bahishkaar se china kaanp uthaa he! thik usee dauraan world bank ne duniya main kaarobaar karne ke liye aasaan (ej of duing bijness) deshon kii ranking jari kii
 The government merged all the hues in the last two years, but in the ease of doing business, India's ranking could barely go up by one point (131 to 130)
 bharat kii is ghatiya ranking kaa china se saste aayaat se bahut gaharaa rishta he
 To understand this, it is necessary to draw the eye to the reality of the market rather than the play of the boycotts
 bharat main ausat masik khapat main ab lagbhag 70 fisadi utpaada menuphaccharing ke hai
 Raw goods like fruits, milk, vegetables also do not reach us without the help of manufacturing (packaging, transport, processing)
 kaaren, frij, tivi, mobile roj kii kharid nahin hai alabatta hamaare upbhog kharch kaa sabase bada hissaa jin utpaadon (cosmetics, saste electronics, garments) main jaataa he, ve saamaanya takanic se banate hai
 The price competitiveness is the basis of their success, which is achieved by setting up units close to the markets and through process and packaging innovation
 china se 61 arab dollar ke aayaat main kareeb ek-tihaai aise hi utpaada hai jinhen choti ikaiyaan, bharat se 50 fisadi tak kam keemat par bana leti hai
