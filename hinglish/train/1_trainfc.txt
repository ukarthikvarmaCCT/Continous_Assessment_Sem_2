 Although Amitabh Bachchan has worked in Hollywood's one-off films, he does not attract much work in Hollywood
 amitabh bachchan kehete hai ki agar mujhase hollywood or bollywood chunane ko kaha jaae to main bollywood ko chununga kyonki yahi meri pahchaan he
 At the same time, Amir Khan says that Hollywood is not interested in anything
 kabhi koi acha kirdaar yaa film mil jaae to kar saktaa hum, magar hollywood ke peeche nahin bhaagunga or hindin filmein chhodkar angreji film nahin kar saktaa
 It is obvious that these stars earned fame from Bollywood

 a magazine attached to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said that the purpose of openly defending Congress president Sonia Gandhi after her son-in-law Robert Vadra was accused of buying benami property in London was to send a clear message to the 'discouraged' Congress workers That 'family is more important than party

 Both have been granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 25 july ko hogi
 Let me tell you, BJP leaders Vijender Gupta and Rajiv Babbar filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal and Sisodia
 in donon maamalon kii sunwaayee ke liye kejariwal or sisodiya aaj yani mangalvaar ko rouj avenue court main pesh hue
 The court granted bail to Kejriwal and Sisodia on a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each
 adaalat ne beete somvaar ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ko manahani maamle main saman jari kiya tha
 This defamation case has been filed on behalf of BJP leader Vijender Gupta
 atirikt mukhya mahanagar dandadhikari kii adaalat ne kejariwal or sisodiya ko 16 july ko apane samaksh pesh hone ko kaha tha
 Along with this, a special court of mps-mlas sent notices to Vijender Gupta, Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Kapil Mishra on Friday in the defamation case filed by Delhi Environment Minister Imran Hussain
 hossain ke anusaar, teenon netaaon kii ore se un par lagbhag 16,000 pedo ko kaatane se sambandhit jhuthe aarope lagane ke baad unhone shikaayat darj karai thi
 Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Samar Vishal has fixed July 30 for personal appearance in the case
 mantri ne daawa kiya ki teenon netaaon ne un par niraadhaar aarope lagaae hai ki hossain ko colony punarvikas pariyojna ke tahat poudharopan ke liye muaavje ke rup main 23 karod rupee mili hai lekin unhone kuch bhi nahin kiya
 The Modi government is on target due to increasing black money of Indians in Swiss banks
 vahiin kendriya vitt mantri piyush goyal ko is badhotaree par hairaani nahin he
 He says that 1
 5 karod rupye desh se baahar le janaa vaid he
 "we will get all the information from 1 January 2018 till the end of the year as per the agreement with Switzerland," Goyal said
 aise main pehle se hi ise blikemani kahana galat he
 He further said, the government is eyeing this and if it is found to be black, then appropriate action will be taken
 beete saal bharat or switzraland ke bich ek agreement hua tha
 Under this, from 1 January 2018, the two countries will exchange information related to transactions and taxes
 haalanki yah bhi tathy he ki 2017 main swiss bainkon main bharatiyon kii blikemani main 50 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 Piyush Goyal did not give information on whether the government will get information from Swiss banks for 2017
 darasal,swiss bainkonmen bharatiyon kii blikemani main 50 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 According to the latest data from the central bank of Switzerland, the money held by Indians in Swiss bank accounts increased by 50% in 2017 to 7000 crore rupees (1
 01 arab frank) ho gaya he
 This figure is also surprising because black money had decreased for three consecutive years after coming to Modi government
 lekin 2016 main notebandi kaa faisle ke baad isamen achaanak badhotaree hui
 The figures the Swiss bank has released are for 2017 and the demonetisation came into effect on 8 November 2016
 yani saaf he ki november 2016 or 2017 ke bich sabase zyada paisa swiss bank pahunchaa
 When the Prime Minister announced demonetisation, it was described as the biggest 'surgical strike' against black money

 In a meeting of the core groups of Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand on Sunday, BJP President Amit Shah has given the government and organization of the three states a month to convince angry activists and resolve local issues
 in teen rajyon (maharashtra, jharkhand or haryana) main bijepi satta main he
 Whereas in all these states, the main rival of the BJP is the Congress
 shah kii aguwai vaali is baithak main party ke mahaamantri raamalaal, maharashtra ke siem devendra fadanvis, saroj pandeya, haryana ke siem manohar laal khatter, anil jain, jharkhand ke siem raghuvar das samet kai anya netaa maujuud the
 Amit Shah took meeting at his residence, according to BJP sources, in a meeting convened at his residence, Amit Shah asked the Chief Ministers of three states to all prepare a framework to maintain the atmosphere in favor of the party during the Lok Sabha elections

 Concerns were raised over the loss of heavyweights to Haryana, despite a landslide victory in the Chintaloksabha election, losing the seats of veteran ministers and not getting the requisite lead on the seats of several prominent faces of the government

 But the party was lagging behind Muslim and Jat dominant seats

 Apart from this, a serious concern was expressed in Union seat Chaudhary Birendra Singh's house seat Unchana by a mere 9000 lead, Beri, Sampla Kiloi, Maham as well as 3 seats of Gurugram
 shah ne in siton par tatkaal halaat sanbhaalane ke sanket die hai or party ke saamne 51 fisadi se zyada voton ko hasil karne target rakhaa gaya he

 aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke bich hue samjhaute ke mutabik donon dal baraabar siton par chunaav ladenge or jisaki siten zyada hongi uskaa siem hoga
 In such a situation, there will be pressure on BJP to get maximum seats
 darasal bijepi kaa maananaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav rashtrawaad or piem modi ke naam par ladaa gaya
 This made local issues secondary in these states
 jabaki in rajyon main sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi maani ja rahi he
 The party also contested the last assembly election with the help of PM Modi's face instead of bringing any face to face
 vidhansabha chunaav main sthaneey mudde haaavee na ho jaaen, isse bachane ke liye party ek baar phir se piem modi ko hi apana cheharaa bananaa chaahati he
 The BJP did not declare the cm's face in the 2014 elections in these three states

 aapane dahej ke liye ladki ke ghar se baraat lautne kii khabar kai baar suni or dekhi hogi, lekin aisa kam hi suna hoga ki ladki ne jayamala stage par jane ke baad bhi baraat waapas kar di
 This happened in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 rohaniya ke basant pattee main somvaar ko dulhan babitha chouhan jayamala ke liye stage par pahunchi to duulhe kii haalat dekhakar gusse se tamtamaa gai
 Actually, the groom and his friends on the stage were drunk and they started committing as soon as the bride reached the stage
 yah baat babitha ko itani buree lagi ki usne shaadi karne se saaf manaa kar diya
 Babita was married on 21st
 apane hone vaale duulhe ke liye usne bade armaan se apane haanthon main mehandi rachaai thi
 She was also dreaming of her golden days in these beautiful designs of mehndi
 21 taarikh ko vah din aa bhi gaya
 The procession at home was welcomed with great pomp
 jayamala ke stage par babitha pahunchi bhi, lekin vahaan jo kuch huwa usase shaadi ke saare armaan chur chur ho gayi
 Babita's wedding card
 dulhan babitha ke bhai ne bataaya, 'jayamala ke samay ladke ke dost stage par chhedhkhani karne lage
 The groom was also supporting friends
 kisi ko koi roak nahin rahaa tha khub bol rahe the
 The groom's mouth smelled of alcohol
 isliye babitha ne shaadi se manaa kar diya
 Comments baraat main aae duulhaa ke doston ne khaane kii plate, kursiyaan phenkna shuru kar diya
 Just then, Babita decided to return the procession at the same time and refused to marry
 baratiyon ko rokane pahunche graminon ke saath bhi jhadap ho gai
 The matter reached the police station
 donon pakshon ko thane bulaakar police ne samajhane kii koshish kii, lekin shaadi kii baat nahin bani
 Henna in Babita's hands
 saat maheene pehle mirzapur ke dohasapura gaanv ke santu chouhan ke bete se babitha kii shaadi tay hui thi
 Regardless, Babita's entire desire for alcohol and dowry went away
 lekin sharaabi duulhe se shaadi na karne kaa uskaa faisla kai ladakiyon ke andar hausala de jaayegaa

 Nobody was stopping anyone, he was speaking a lot
 duulhe ke munh se sharaab kii badboo aa rahi thi
 So Babita refused to marry

 bas, babitha ne usee pal baraat lautaane kii thaan lee or shaadi se inkaar kar diya
 There was also a clash with the villagers who came to stop the wedding

 Motorola has announced the launch of its strongest smartphone Moto x Force in India on 1 February
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki yah launch se pehle hi amejan india kii website par darj ho gaya he
 Motorola, after coming back to market, had tied up with e-commerce company Flipkart to sell its smartphones in India and so far all its smartphones are available only there
 amejan india nefilhal is phone kii uplabdhtaor keemat ke baar main nahin likhaa he par phone kii puri detail website par maujuud he
 It is worth noting that at the end of last year, the company announced to sell some of its smartphones on other e-commerce websites besides Flipkart
 ab Moto x Force ke amejan india par darj hone ke baad ummid he ki company is saal kuch smartphone duusari i-commers vebasit par bhi bechegi
 At present, Motorola has not confirmed this
 1 farvari ko yah phone launch hone vaala tha jo girane par bhi nahin tuutegaa
 During this event, the company can also provide information about its availability on Amazon

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 media ke prakaar main bharat kaa jitna moulik yogadan he, utana duniya ke kisi media kaa nahin hoga
 Our fraternity has an intrinsic contribution in this nomenclature, as well as other fraternities too
 kuch naamon ke peeche sachai he, lekin kuch naamon kaa istamaal hathiyaar ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Like accusation
 media trial karata he to media kaa bhi trial hota he
 This cycle now includes social media and public
 pehle aapako patrakarita ke chand prakaaron se avgat karaate hai
 Yet to show the bad side of the media, Yellow Journalism must have heard about yellow journalism, embedded Germanism, stapled journalism, tabloid journalism
 ab isamen tiarapy media, swarg se seedhi media, bhoot-pret patrakarita, ped media, supaari jarnalism, prestitude bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 Apart from this, some names have been created by social media through IT media or supporters of political parties
 sicular media jo secular baaten karata he, kangi media jo congress samarthak he, sanghee media jo sangh samarthak he, modia yani modimay media jo sirf modi modi karata he, aap media jo kejariwal ko hero banaata he, bazaaru media jo survey main kisi party ko haraata he
 Corporate media is also a regular charge, which is considered the father of all truths
 pehali baar kisi desh se nikaale jane kaa saubhaahgya hamen hi praapt hua he
 # Gobackindianmedia is trending on Twitter in Nepal
 nepali yuvaaon ne bhartiya media ke ati kawarez, asamvedansheel sawaal or apni sarkaar kaa bhompu ban jane ke kaaran yah trend karaayaa
 Whatever was earned by the Government of India through its commendable efforts, some part of our media spent it at the cost of Rs
 vaise twitor ke trend ko nepal kaa maanas nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Now come to the types of trials
 is chakra ko bhi samajhnaa hota he
 Earlier there was a media trial, in which there was a campaign to punish the accused in cases like Jessica Lal, Priyadarshini Mattoo, Nitish Katara
 is had tak sabane media trial kii saraahna kii, lekin jaldi hi yah trial kangaroo court main badalane laga, yani jise chaahe use aaropee banaao or uski saakh daagdar bana do
 The media first tried or accused people, leaders and parties of being tried
 jaise ek channel par puraani dilli kii ek teacher kaa is kadar trial chalaa ki bheed jamaa ho gai peetane ke liye
 The broadcast of the said channel was also stopped for a month
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi shikaayat karte rahe ki media ne unke saath trial kiya
 The media was accused of making Kejriwal a hero
 jabaki baad main isi media par pradhanmantri ke prati udaartaa baratane or arvind kejariwal ke bahishkaar ke aarope lage
 The trial of Rahul Gandhi has not reduced but his complaint has not come yet
 ek jamaane main lalu yadav bhi shikaayat karte the ki dilli kii media unka trial karata he or mazaaq udaata he
 Parties also conduct media trials and conduct media trials through social media
 soshal media ke zariye vyaktigat patrakaron kaa bhi trial hota he jab unhen dalal, agent vagairah kaha jaataa he
 There is a group of social media trial court judges, Modi devotees, Aptards and blind devotees
 kab kis party kaa iti cell kis media or patrkaar kaa trial shuru kar de pataa nahin rahata
 Trial of political parties was also conducted through social media through IT cell
 phenku, pappu or mafalar main is trial kaa hissaa hai
 The media also tests the political party
 kai channelon ne aam aadmi party kaa paksh rakhana hi band kar diya tha
 Media trials run in the media
 yah bilkul nayaa to nahin magar do-teen saal purana item he
 In order to avoid the alleged trial of a channel, a new channel was launched, in which the use of abusive language is used in the news against each other's owners and in a campaign, the two fight each other
 is tarah aapane dekha ki media trial ke kitne str hai
 There have been new judges of this trial court named Mr
 Hashtag
 twitor par aae din hashtag ji kisi ko villen to kisi ko hero banaate rahete hai
 This is not the case in a court trial
 vahaan donon paksh ke vakil hote hai, saboot or gavaah laae jate hai or har baat kii jaanch ke baad faisla aata he
 The decision is taken at the same time in the media trial
 itani bhoomika isliye baandhi ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne trylon kii duniya main ek nayaa trial launch kiya he
 When someone suggested him a public trial, he liked it
 pehle dekhte hai unhone is bare main kya kaha
 If you see that a channel has shown something wrong which was factually incorrect, you will pick it up by taking the name of the channel
 jaise in bhai sahab ne bahut acha suzav diya, ki ek public trial bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Inside Delhi, you fix 8-10 places
 or vahaan janata ko ikattha kiijie
 And show that this channel showed it
 ye jhooth he
 This public trial can be started
 tippaniyan Public trials of the media run daily on social media, but if a party advocates conducting a trial in public, then everyone's ears should be raised
 media main bahut kamiyaan hai
 It must be talked about and continues to happen, but what is a public trial
 akhabaaron ke patrakaron ne jab selary badhaane ke liye majithia board kii siforishein lagu karwaane ke liye netaaon ke darvaaze khatkhataye to kahin se jawaab nahin mila
 Kejriwal said that we will get you the right, but when the same Kejriwal says that there should be a public trial of the media, then you have the same thing in my mind which is knocking in my mind
 abhi tak media ke bure paksh ko darshane ke liye yelo jarnalism pit patrakarita, ambeded germanalism yani natthi patrakarita, tebolide patrakarita ke bare main suna hoga
 Now it has also joined TRP Media, Stairway to Heaven Media, Ghost Journalism, Paid Media, Supari Journalism, Prestitude
 iske alaava kuch naam raajnneetik dalon ke iti cell yaa samarthakon ne soshal media ke zarie gadhe hai
 Secular media which talks secular, Congi media which is pro-congress, Sanghi media which is pro-sangh, Modiya i
e
 Modi media which only Modi does, AAP media which makes Kejriwal a hero, Bazaru media which makes any party in the survey Beats corporate media bhi ek niyamit aarope he, jo sari sachchaaiyon kaa baap mana jaataa he
 For the first time we have had the privilege of being expelled from a country
 nepal main twitor par # gobackindianmedia trend karne laga he
 The Nepalese youth made this trend due to the extremely covert, insensitive questions of the Indian media and becoming the horn of their government
 bharat sarkaar ne apane saraahneey prayaason se jo kuch bhi kamaaya tha, use hamaari media ke kuch hisse ne chavanni-athnni ke bhav se kharch kar diya
 By the way, the trend of Twitter should not be considered as the mood of Nepal
 ab aate hai trial ke prakaaron par
 This cycle also has to be understood
 pehle media trial hota tha, jisamen jesica laal, priyadarshini mattu, nitish kataara jaise maamalon main aropiyon ko sazaa dilaane kaa abhiyaan chalaa
 To this extent, everyone appreciated the media trial, but soon this trial started changing in the Kangaroo Court, that is, make him accused and make his credibility tainted
 media ne pehle logon, netaaon or partiyon kaa trial kiya yaa trial kiye jane ke aarope lage
 Like a trial run by a teacher in Old Delhi on such a channel that the crowd had gathered to beat
 ukt channel kaa prasaaran ek maheene ke liye roka bhi gaya
 Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also complained that the media tried him
 media par aarope laga ki usne kejariwal ko hero banaaya
 Later, the same media was accused of being lenient towards the Prime Minister and boycotting Arvind Kejriwal
 trial rahul gandhi kii bhi kam nahin hui magar unki shikaayat abhi ai nahin he
 At one time Lalu Yadav also used to complain that the Delhi media trials him and makes fun of him
 partiyaan bhi media kaa trial karti hai or soshal media ke zariye media kaa trial karaati hai
 Individual journalists are also tried through social media when they are called brokers, agents, etc
 soshal media ke trial court ke jajon kaa samooh bana hua he modi bhakt, aaptard or andhbhakt
 It is not known when the IT cell of which party starts the trial of which media and journalist
 iti cell ke zarie soshal media ke zarie raajnneetik dalon kaa trial bhi chalaa
 Fenku, Pappu and Muffler Man are part of this trial
 media bhi raajnneetik dal kaa trial karata he
 Many channels had stopped favoring the Aam Aadmi Party
 media main media kaa trial chalata he
 This is not a new but two-three year old item
 isamen ek channel ke kathith trial se bachane ke liye nayaa channel hi launch ho gaya, jisamen ek duusare ke swaamiyon ke kilaaf khabaron main abhadra bhashaa kaa istamaal ho jaataa he or ek abhiyaan ke tahat donon ek duusare se bhide rahete hai
 In this way you saw how many levels of media trials
 is trial court ke nae jaj aae hai, jinka naam mistar hashtag he
 On the day of Twitter, the hashtag keeps making someone a villain and someone a hero
 adaalat ke trial main aise nahin hota
 There are lawyers from both sides, evidence and witnesses are brought and after investigation of everything comes the verdict
 media trial main faisla usee vakt ho jaataa he
 Such a role was played because Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has launched a new trial in the world of trials
 kisi ne unhen public trial kaa suzav diya, to unhen pasand aa gaya
 Let us first see what he said about this
 agar aap dekhte hai ki kisi channel ne kuch galat dikhaaya he jo ki tathyaatmak rup se galat tha, usko channel kaa naam lekar aap uthaaenge
 As these brothers have very well suggested, a public trial can also be done
 dilli ke andar aap 8-10 jagah fiks kar dijie
 And gather the public there
 or dikhaaiye ki is channel ne ye dikhaaya tha
 that's a lie
 ye janata kaa trial shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 The comments media kaa public trial to soshal media par rose chalata he, lekin koi party public main trial chalaane kii vakaalat karen to sabake kaan khadey ho jane chahie
 There are many shortcomings in the media
 uski zarur baat honi chahie or hoti rahati he, lekin public trial kya he
 When the journalists of the newspapers knocked on the doors of the leaders to implement the recommendations of the Majithia Board to increase the salary, there was no response from anywhere
 kejariwal ne kaha ki ham aapako haq dilaayenge, lekin vahi kejariwal jab yah kehete hai ki media kaa public trial hona chahie to aapane man main vahi khatka jo mere man main khatak rahaa he
 Apart from this, some names have been created by social media through IT media or supporters of political parties
 sicular media jo secular baaten karata he, kangi media jo congress samarthak he, sanghee media jo sangh samarthak he, modia yani modimay media jo sirf modi modi karata he, aap media jo kejariwal ko hero banaata he, bazaaru media jo survey main kisi party ko haraata he
 Corporate media is also a regular charge, which is considered the father of all truths
 pehali baar kisi desh se nikaale jane kaa saubhaahgya hamen hi praapt hua he
 # Gobackindianmedia is trending on Twitter in Nepal
 nepali yuvaaon ne bhartiya media ke ati kawarez, asamvedansheel sawaal or apni sarkaar kaa bhompu ban jane ke kaaran yah trend karaayaa
 Whatever was earned by the Government of India through its commendable efforts, some part of our media spent it at the cost of Rs
 vaise twitor ke trend ko nepal kaa maanas nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Now come to the types of trials
 is chakra ko bhi samajhnaa hota he
 Earlier there was a media trial, in which there was a campaign to punish the accused in cases like Jessica Lal, Priyadarshini Mattoo, Nitish Katara
 is had tak sabane media trial kii saraahna kii, lekin jaldi hi yah trial kangaroo court main badalane laga, yani jise chaahe use aaropee banaao or uski saakh daagdar bana do
 The media first tried or accused people, leaders and parties of being tried
 jaise ek channel par puraani dilli kii ek teacher kaa is kadar trial chalaa ki bheed jamaa ho gai peetane ke liye
 The broadcast of the said channel was also stopped for a month
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi shikaayat karte rahe ki media ne unke saath trial kiya
 The media was accused of making Kejriwal a hero
 jabaki baad main isi media par pradhanmantri ke prati udaartaa baratane or arvind kejariwal ke bahishkaar ke aarope lage
 The trial of Rahul Gandhi has not reduced but his complaint has not come yet
 ek jamaane main lalu yadav bhi shikaayat karte the ki dilli kii media unka trial karata he or mazaaq udaata he
 Parties also conduct media trials and conduct media trials through social media
 soshal media ke zariye vyaktigat patrakaron kaa bhi trial hota he jab unhen dalal, agent vagairah kaha jaataa he
 There is a group of social media trial court judges, Modi devotees, Aptards and blind devotees
 kab kis party kaa iti cell kis media or patrkaar kaa trial shuru kar de pataa nahin rahata
 Trial of political parties was also conducted through social media through IT cell
 phenku, pappu or mafalar main is trial kaa hissaa hai
 The media also tests the political party
 kai channelon ne aam aadmi party kaa paksh rakhana hi band kar diya tha
 Media trials run in the media
 yah bilkul nayaa to nahin magar do-teen saal purana item he
 In order to avoid the alleged trial of a channel, a new channel was launched, in which the use of abusive language is used in the news against each other's owners and in a campaign, the two fight each other
 is tarah aapane dekha ki media trial ke kitne str hai
 There have been new judges of this trial court named Mr
 Hashtag
 twitor par aae din hashtag ji kisi ko villen to kisi ko hero banaate rahete hai
 This is not the case in a court trial
 vahaan donon paksh ke vakil hote hai, saboot or gavaah laae jate hai or har baat kii jaanch ke baad faisla aata he
 The decision is taken at the same time in the media trial
 itani bhoomika isliye baandhi ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne trylon kii duniya main ek nayaa trial launch kiya he
 When someone suggested him a public trial, he liked it
 pehle dekhte hai unhone is bare main kya kaha
 If you see that a channel has shown something wrong which was factually incorrect, you will pick it up by taking the name of the channel
 jaise in bhai sahab ne bahut acha suzav diya, ki ek public trial bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Inside Delhi, you fix 8-10 places
 or vahaan janata ko ikattha kiijie
 And show that this channel showed it
 ye jhooth he
 This public trial can be started
 tippaniyan Public trials of the media run daily on social media, but if a party advocates conducting a trial in public, then everyone's ears should be raised
 media main bahut kamiyaan hai
 It must be talked about and continues to happen, but what is a public trial
 akhabaaron ke patrakaron ne jab selary badhaane ke liye majithia board kii siforishein lagu karwaane ke liye netaaon ke darvaaze khatkhataye to kahin se jawaab nahin mila
 Kejriwal said that we will get you the right, but when the same Kejriwal says that there should be a public trial of the media, then you have the same thing in my mind which is knocking in my mind
 pehali baar kisi desh se nikaale jane kaa saubhaahgya hamen hi praapt hua he

 bharat sarkaar ne apane saraahneey prayaason se jo kuch bhi kamaaya tha, use hamaari media ke kuch hisse ne chavanni-athnni ke bhav se kharch kar diya
 By the way, the trend of Twitter should not be considered as the mood of Nepal
 ab aate hai trial ke prakaaron par
 This cycle also has to be understood
 pehle media trial hota tha, jisamen jesica laal, priyadarshini mattu, nitish kataara jaise maamalon main aropiyon ko sazaa dilaane kaa abhiyaan chalaa
 To this extent, everyone appreciated the media trial, but soon this trial started changing in the Kangaroo Court, that is, make him accused and make his credibility tainted
 media ne pehle logon, netaaon or partiyon kaa trial kiya yaa trial kiye jane ke aarope lage
 Like a trial run by a teacher in Old Delhi on such a channel that the crowd had gathered to beat
 ukt channel kaa prasaaran ek maheene ke liye roka bhi gaya
 Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also complained that the media tried him
 media par aarope laga ki usne kejariwal ko hero banaaya
 Later, the same media was accused of being lenient towards the Prime Minister and boycotting Arvind Kejriwal
 trial rahul gandhi kii bhi kam nahin hui magar unki shikaayat abhi ai nahin he
 At one time Lalu Yadav also used to complain that the Delhi media trials him and makes fun of him
 partiyaan bhi media kaa trial karti hai or soshal media ke zariye media kaa trial karaati hai
 Individual journalists are also tried through social media when they are called brokers, agents, etc
 soshal media ke trial court ke jajon kaa samooh bana hua he modi bhakt, aaptard or andhbhakt
 It is not known when the IT cell of which party starts the trial of which media and journalist
 iti cell ke zarie soshal media ke zarie raajnneetik dalon kaa trial bhi chalaa
 Fenku, Pappu and Muffler Man are part of this trial
 media bhi raajnneetik dal kaa trial karata he
 Many channels had stopped favoring the Aam Aadmi Party
 media main media kaa trial chalata he
 This is not a new but two-three year old item
 isamen ek channel ke kathith trial se bachane ke liye nayaa channel hi launch ho gaya, jisamen ek duusare ke swaamiyon ke kilaaf khabaron main abhadra bhashaa kaa istamaal ho jaataa he or ek abhiyaan ke tahat donon ek duusare se bhide rahete hai
 In this way you saw how many levels of media trials
 is trial court ke nae jaj aae hai, jinka naam mistar hashtag he
 On the day of Twitter, the hashtag keeps making someone a villain and someone a hero
 adaalat ke trial main aise nahin hota
 There are lawyers from both sides, evidence and witnesses are brought and after investigation of everything comes the verdict
 media trial main faisla usee vakt ho jaataa he
 Such a role was played because Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has launched a new trial in the world of trials
 kisi ne unhen public trial kaa suzav diya, to unhen pasand aa gaya
 Let us first see what he said about this

 Media trials run in the media
 yah bilkul nayaa to nahin magar do-teen saal purana item he
 In order to avoid the alleged trial of a channel, a new channel was launched, in which the use of abusive language is used in the news against each other's owners and in a campaign, the two fight each other
 is tarah aapane dekha ki media trial ke kitne str hai
 There have been new judges of this trial court named Mr
 Hashtag
 twitor par aae din hashtag ji kisi ko villen to kisi ko hero banaate rahete hai
 This is not the case in a court trial

 The decision is taken at the same time in the media trial
 itani bhoomika isliye baandhi ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne trylon kii duniya main ek nayaa trial launch kiya he
 When someone suggested him a public trial, he liked it

 If you see that a channel has shown something wrong which was factually incorrect, you will pick it up by taking the name of the channel
 jaise in bhai sahab ne bahut acha suzav diya, ki ek public trial bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Inside Delhi, you fix 8-10 places
 or vahaan janata ko ikattha kiijie
 And show that this channel showed it
 ye jhooth he
 This public trial can be started
 tippaniyan Public trials of the media run daily on social media, but if a party advocates conducting a trial in public, then everyone's ears should be raised
 media main bahut kamiyaan hai
 It must be talked about and continues to happen, but what is a public trial
 akhabaaron ke patrakaron ne jab selary badhaane ke liye majithia board kii siforishein lagu karwaane ke liye netaaon ke darvaaze khatkhataye to kahin se jawaab nahin mila

 On the day of Twitter, the hashtag keeps making someone a villain and someone a hero
 adaalat ke trial main aise nahin hota

 When the journalists of the newspapers knocked on the doors of the leaders to implement the recommendations of the Majithia Board to increase the salary, there was no response from anywhere
 kejariwal ne kaha ki ham aapako haq dilaayenge, lekin vahi kejariwal jab yah kehete hai ki media kaa public trial hona chahie to aapane man main vahi khatka jo mere man main khatak rahaa he

 iske baad hi special court ne us samay sibiai kii closer report ko khaarij karte hue, is maamle kii phir se jaanch karne ko kaha tha

 Significantly, the allegations of trying to cover-up the Vyapam scam have now focused on the death of 19-year-old medical student Namrata Damor three years ago, despite the police saying that the postmortem report was 'strangled' to death
 Was dismissed as a suicide

 While talking to NDTV, Dr
 bibi purohit ne kaha tha ki postmortem karne vaale panel main shaamil ham teenon doctoron ko 25-25 saal se bhi zyaada kaa tajurba he
 There were scratches on his (namrata's) nose and mouth, indicating that his throat was choked
 is postmortem ke do saal baad police ne kaha tha ki chaatra train se gir gai thi
 Senior police officer Manohar Verma had said that we investigated his death and re-created the scene with forensic experts
 hamen aisa kuch nahin mila, jisase hatya kiye jane ke sanket mil saken
 If any new evidence comes out, we can double check, but nothing is like that at the moment

 rohingya musalamaanon ke haq kii aad main aatanki sanghathan arakaan rohingya salveshan army (ARSA) apane napak mansoobon ko anjaam de rahaa he
 ARSA is spreading terrorism and has taken up a gun against the army of its own country, which has to bear the biggest bounty of millions of Rohingya Muslims who have been forced to go homeless from their own country without any fault
 ajtak ke paas rohingya aatankwaadiyon kaa ek Exclusive video he, jisamen rohingya aatanki myanmar sena par bada hamalaa karne kii kasam kha rahe hai

 com / kco6kmfzar —to date (@aajtak) October 10, 2017 400 Rohingya terrorists from August 25 till now a few days ago the Myanmar army itself revealed that about 400 Arakan Rohingya terrorists have been killed since August 25
 vahiin, myanmar ke rakhin praant main 25 agast ke baad se ab tak arakaan rohingya salveshan army ke hamalon main 84 log maare ja chuke hai
 The Myanmar Army claims Rohingya militants killed 163 people in a year from October 2016 to August 2017, including local officials, government employees and security forces
 rohingya aatankiyon ne 45 hinduon ko bhi utaara tha maut ke ghatmyanmar ke rakhin praant main teen samuhik kabron se kam se kam 45 hinduon ke shav milane ke baad myanmar sarkaar ne in hatyaon ke liye rohingya aatankwaadiyon ko hi jimmedaar bataaya tha
 The Pakistani Ataullah is the chief of the ARSA
 The old name of ARSA was Harkatul Zacha, whose name was first heard by the world in October 2016, when his militants attacked three police posts in Myanmar and killed nine policemen
 International Crisis Group kii report ke mutabik ARSA kaa chif ataullahpakistanke karachi main janma rohingya yuvak he, jo saudi arab kaa naagarik he
 No sign of Rohingya terrorists The exact number of terrorists in the ARSA is not known, but the organization is said to have a few thousand trained terrorists, many of whom have been killed in the operations of the Myanmar army
 rohingya sankat shuru hone ke baad bharat sarkaar ne do took shabdon main kaha tha ki wo rohingya musalamaanon ko sharan nahin degi, kyonki rohingya musalamaanon ke aatankwaadiyon se rishte hai or rohingya sankat ke baad ye rishte or bhi gahare ho rahe hai
 Rohingya terrorists are seen with suspicion
 Aaj Tak recently published a ground report of Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar, which these days remains a refuge for five million Rohingya Muslims and there are scattered stories of Myanmar army atrocities on Rohingya Muslims, but This was just one aspect of the story
 rohingya musalamaanon par myanmar sena kii jyadatiyon kaa doosraa pahalu bhi he, jisamen bataur mukhya kirdaar rohingya arakaan salveshan army yani ARSA kii pramukh bhoomika he
 Because of this, Rohingya Muslims are being viewed with suspicion all over the world
 inhen aatankwaadi kaha ja rahaa he
 Because ARSA has been confirmed to have links with terrorist organizations around the world, on whose own ARSA terrorists are plotting a major terrorist attack against the Myanmar army

 Out of these, taking some initial steps of water and electricity tried to create a positive image
 lekin sarkaar chalaane kaa jo andaaj saamne aayaa he, usase sarkaar kii saakh par batta laga he
 The executive hero, the judiciary, the media and the legislature, the savvy heroes of a democratic government, conduct their work on a balanced relationship with the four, unfortunately the leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party's government appears to be panic-stricken and self-assured
 aap logon par jis tareeke se karrwai hui, uski kya pramukh vajah thi?chunaav jeetne kii asaadhaaran ghatana ke baad is vijay ke mul shilpiyon main se kuch mahatvapurn logon ko gaddaar ghoshit karke baahar nikaalane kii jid
 It seems to stem from deep insecurity or suicidal ego

 What is the truth? Aam Aadmi Party is a platform for alternative politics on the basis of transparency
 hamaare aagrah se kharchon kaa vivaran saamne aata to party ke andar chal rahi kaanaafoosee band ho jaati
 Now when the details are revealed by the discovery and research of others, the glow of many glowing faces will end

 party ke andar ek jabardast taatkaalik ekta kii kshamta kaa kaaran dilli kii sarkaar par agle paanch saal ke liye swaamitv he
 Therefore, many people are facing the conflict between heart and mind, but there is no special dilemma in the family of Aam Aadmi Party outside Delhi
 aap sansthaapak sadsy rahe hai
 Kejriwal used to talk to the Internal Lokpal on any allegations, not now

 Will your Swaraj dialogue take the form of a political party or just like a platform? It is a huge flow that will become a party for fighting elections as branches, a platform for movements, a platform for social reform and harmony
 ham vidhyaarthiyon se lekar, naujavaanon, mahilaon, kisaanon, doctoron, vakeelon, buddhijiviyon ke liye sakriy naagarikta ke manch banaaenge
 But this will remain a basic stream which we are not in favor of joining any political party
 lekin iske garbh se chunaav ke liye asardaar rajnatik dal paidaa ho to us par kisi ko aashcharya nahin hona chahie

 The terrorist organization Jaish has found its new poster boy to spread terror in Kashmir
 kashmir ghati main apane pair pasaarne ke liye samir tiger ko apana nayaa cheharaa banaaya he
 Sameer Tiger joined Hizbul Mujahideen in 2016
 qareeb ek maheene pehle hi wo jaish main shaamil ho gaya
 Sameer is a resident of Pulwama and has been involved in many Hizbul attacks
 jaish ko ek aise aatankiki talash thi jo na sirf ghati se ho balki pehle se trend ho
 This is the reason why, like Burhan Wani, there is also a plan to make him a poster boy by making him a role model of the factory of terrorism
 samir ne haal hi menatankivsim ke janaaze main shaamil hokar firing bhi kii thi
 The security agency is fully aware of this and a plan for its elimination has also been prepared
 suraksha agency ko mil rahi jaankaree ke mutabiq jaish kai saalon baad kashmir main bade level par active hone kii koshish kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, its terrorists will try to execute a big terrorist incident this winter
 sena ke sutron ke anusaar is saal jaish e mohammad ke videshi aatankiyon ne 9 se 10 ke group main ghuspaith kii thi, jisamen se qareeb 6 maare ja chuke hai
 At the same time, around 12-15 are still alive and are trying to carry out some other big terrorist event

 The bill on triple talaq will be introduced in the Lok Sabha on Thursday

 The mps have been asked to appear in the Lok Sabha on both days
 aapako bataa den ki guuruuvaar subah hi party ne sansadeey dal kii baithak bhi bulaai he
 There has been an uproar in Parliament for the last few days over the statement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 vipaksh piem modi se maafee kii maang par ada he, isi kaaran sansad main pichley dinon koi khaas kaam nahin ho paaya he
 Now the government is trying to get the triple talaq bill passed as soon as possible
 muslim personal lau board ne bill ko bataaya muslim virodhiol india muslim personal lau board ne is bill ko mahila virdohi bataaya he
 The working committee of the Personal Law Board met in this regard on Sunday last in Lucknow
 is baithak main teen talaak par prastaavit bill ko lekar charchaa kii gai
 After several hours of meeting, the board decided to reject the bill
 itnaa hi nahin tripal talaak par laae ja rahe is bill ko board ne mahila virdohi bataaya he
 At the same time, the proposed draft which gives a sentence of three years is called a criminal act
 board kii meeting main teen talaak par kanoon ko mahilaon kii aazaadee main dakhal kaha gaya he
 How will the bill? Significantly, the government is bringing this bill under the name 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act'
 ye kanoon sirf teen talaak (INSTANT TALAQ, yani talaak-e-biddat) par hi lagu hoga
 After this law, if any Muslim husband gives three divorces to the wife, then it will be illegal
 iske baad se kisi bhi swaroop main diya gaya teen talaak vah chahen maukhik ho, likhit or yaa massej main, vah avaidh hoga
 Anyone who divorces three can be punished and fined for three years
 yani teen talaak dena gaiyr-jamaanti or sangyeya ( Cognizable) aparaadh hoga
 In this the magistrate will decide how much penalty will be there
 piem narendra modi ne teen talaak par kanoon banane ke liye ek mantri samooh banaaya tha, jisamen rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, peepi choudhary or jitendra singh shaamil the
 Such is the proposed bill - it would be illegal to say a three-time divorce (by speaking, writing or via electronic means like email, SMS and whatsapp)
 - aisa karne vaale pati ko teen saal ke karawas kii sajaa ho sakati he
 This would be considered a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 - yah kanoon sirf 'talaak e biddat' yani ek saath teen baar talaak bolne par lagu hoga
 - The victim of divorce can appeal to the Magistrate seeking alimony for himself and minor children
 - peedit mahila magistrate se naaballig bacchon ke sangrakshan kaa bhi anurodh kar sakati he
 The magistrate will take a final decision on the issue
 - yah prastaavit kanoon jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar puure desh main lagu hoga he

 Taking a dig at Akhilesh over his alliance with the BSP, he said neither me nor Netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav) consider Mayawati as a sister
 to kaise akhilesh unako buaa bula rahe hai
 He said that Mayawati cannot be trusted
 vah kabhi sapa ko 'gundon kii sarkaar' kaha karti thim
 Shivpal's aggressive attitude towards Akhilesh did not stop here
 unhone kaha akhilesh ne apane pita or chachaa donon ko dhokhaa diya
 This is also one of the reasons Shivpal has contested from Firozabad seat because Shivpal is believed to have influence in Firozabad and surrounding districts
 ve saansad or unke bhattije akshay yadav ko kadi takkar dene main sakasham hai
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the SP also had to face defeat here
 congress ke rajbabbar ne tab is seat par jeet hasil kii thi
 Please tell that Shivpal Yadav's party will contest all 80 seats in the Lok Sabha in the upcoming elections
 shivpal ne pragatisheel samaajawaadee party kaa gathan bhajite akhilesh yadav se matbhed ke baad kiya tha
 Shivpal's move is seen as an attempt to spoil the SP-BSP game
 shivpal ne jab firozabad se chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya to isapar ramgopal yadav ne apni pratikriya di
 He said that in democracy, anyone has the right to fight from anywhere
 shivpal lade, mujhe aitraaj nahin he
 Professor Ram Gopal Yadav said that Akshay is already an MP
 ab saamne koun ladata he, koun nahin ladata he isamen ham kya kah sakate hai
 We have no objection loktantr main har aadmi ko apana chunaav ladane kaa haq hota he
 What feedback should we give in this? to aise main saaf he uttar pradesh ke logon ko ek baar phir yadav parivaar kii jang dekhne ko milegi
 Who will be the winner of this battle, it will be known only when the results of the election will come
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hui thi pehali 'jang'yah koi pehali baar nahin he ki jab yadav parivaar kii ladaai dekhne ko milegi
 Earlier, the uncle-nephew war started when the SP expelled three young leaders for anti-party activities
 nishkasit kiye gaye netaa sunil singh yadav or anand bhadauria akhilesh yadav ke kareebi ke taur par jane jate hai
 This decision was taken at the behest of Shivpal, who was also announced by then state president Akhilesh Yadav
 iske baad kaumi ekta dal kaa samaajawaadee party main vilay ho gaya
 Its two top three leaders were formally inducted into Mulayam Singh's party
 vilay ke liye shivpal ko jimmedaar mana jaataa rahaa
 Akhilesh did not want the disputed leaders in the party
 baad main akhilesh ne cabinet mantri or varisht netaa balram yadav ko barkhaast kar diya
 Let us know that Mukhtar Ansari, the leader of the Qaumi Ekta Dal, has a criminal background, although his supporters present him as robin-hood
 haalanki party ne tab you-turn liya or vilay radd ho gaya
 The Qaumi Ekta Dal accused Akhilesh of insulting her during this period
 is puure jhagade main logon ke bich akhilesh kii ek saaf chhavi dikhaane kii koshish kii gai
 Akhilesh then inducted Balaram Yadav into the cabinet
 in sabhi faislon se shivpal ko lag rahaa tha ki unki party main nahin suni ja rahi
 He also threatened to resign
 iske baad 15 agast kii raily main mulaayam ne kaha agar shivpal istipha dete hai to sapa do hisson main tut jaaegi
 All this 'drama' continued
 2017 main uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle yah jang or bad gai
 When Akhilesh aligned with the Congress
 shivpal yadav congress ke saath gathbandhan ke bilkul paksh main nahin the
 He made this statement from public forums
 baavjood iske akhilesh yadav ne rahul gandhi se haath milaayaa
 Shivpal believed that he played an important role in raising the SP and he is not being heard today
 yah ladaai ek ahm kii ladaai ho gai
 Throughout this quarrel, Mulayam's cousin Ram Gopal was with Akhilesh Yadav
 vah lagataar unka samarthan karte rahe
 During this period, sp's family feud continued even after the crushing defeat in the assembly elections
 shivpal pad gaye the alag-thalokhilesh yadav se vivaad ke chalate shivpal yadav parivaar main alag-thalag pad gaye
 Shivpal never attacked his elder brother Mulayam amid a dispute with his nephew
 mulaayam ne bhi shivpal ko manaane kii har sambhav koshish kii
 But he never came directly in support of Shivpal
 is kaaran shivpal yadav parivaar main bhi gumnami main pahunch gaye
 The compulsion to preserve political existence forced them to take a different path

 com / rlvzlxj5ra nai dilli lambey samay se videsh niti ke maamle main seedhi-dar seedhi badhane kaa tarika apanaati rahi he—ek-ek karke or kram se
 But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to change this
 ve adhiktam sambhav nateeja hasil karnaa chaahate hai, kisi bhi desh se bharat ko jo bhi mil saktaa he—vah sab jutanaa chaahate hai, ve duusare rajya yaa raashtra pramukhon se milane ke liye aage badhkar haath milaane ko taiyaar hai, bhale hi isamen atirikt rajnatik jokhim ho
 In short, they want to combine India's foreign policy with its large and ambitious domestic agenda
 aisa karke modi dusron kii apekshaayen bhi badhaate ja rahe hai, or yah vah dayera he, jisamen bharat phiseddi sabit hota rahaa he
 Whether it is a matter of investment or taking up projects in other countries, especially in the neighborhood, India's work has often proved to be much less than what was said
 in dhruvon ke bich modi sarkaar kii videsh niti kuch spasht siddhanton ke idgird aakaar le rahi he
 For example, introducing best traditions such as clean Ganga, smart city and renewable energy to pioneer domestic efforts; Emerging as a true provider of economic magnets and security in South Asia, extending to the Indian Ocean; Increase dominance by organizing the influential Indian community abroad as a strong lobby group; Defining the sphere of influence into a cultural framework
 pados or prabhaav kshetraunaka drushtikon adhiktam sambhav hasil karne kaa he, jisaki shuruyaat sarthak aarthik sahyog main aadchan daalane vaali rajnatik baadhaon ko hataane ke saath hoti he
 For example, when the new President of Sri Lanka came to India, it was clear that the political situation in Colombo had not yet stabilized, so there would not be much in concrete terms
 iske baavjood, naagarik parmaanu samjhaute kaa vichaar talasha gaya or us samjhaute par hastakshar kar liye gaye, sirf yah sanket dene ke liye ki kudankulam main bharat dwaara riektaron kaa nirmaan kiye jane ke bhay se utpann nakaaratmak bhaavana se donon desh paar paa chuke hai
 a similar idea had helped resolve the hurdle of nuclear accountability with the US and allowed both sides to move forward and focus on issues such as asia-pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) membership
 islamabad main turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-bharat (tapi) ke sanchaalan samooh kii baithak main mantriyon ke samooh main petroleum or prakritik gas mantri dharmendra pradhan sabase dur vaale chor par baithe the, tabhi pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif un tak pahunche
 They took him aside and walked along for a while, asked him about Modi and wanted to know how his government was doing
 is tarah sharif ne sanket diya ki ve baatcheet shuru karne ke liye utsuk hai
 Meanwhile, the Pakistan government tried to allay Indian concerns over the possible release of lashkar-e-taiba commander zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi by deciding to remain in jail
 bharat main ise sakaaratmak taur par dekha gaya or isse bharat ko baatcheet na karne ke rukh se thodaa naram padane kaa mauka mila
 However, concerns remain as Pakistan still wants freedom to talk to separatist groups in Kashmir
 or isi kaaran modi kii cricket kootneeti mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 Behind this symbolism, a new attempt to bring Pakistan into the SAARC discourse is hidden once again
 asal main, is samay sabhi padosi deshon main rajnatik maahaul bharat ke paksh main he, vichaar yah he ki pakistan ke saath baat aage badhaai jaae, or dakshes ke jhande tale kaamkaaj aage badhane diya jaae
 If Pakistan remains stubborn, India intensifies efforts at the sub-regional level by starting projects like BBIN Grid providing grid connectivity across Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal
 sarkaar ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki bharat dwipaksheeya baatcheet shuru karne ke pakistani prastaavon par vichaar karne ko raji ho saktaa he
 The Sharif government suggested that talks on Kashmir and terrorism be held separately, and that it be kept out of the framework of the composite dialogue
 south block isse sahamat nahin he lekin andruni sutron ke mutabik pakistan dakshes aarthik sahyog agenda par aage badhane kaa iraadaa jataata he, to bharat vichaar karne ko taiyaar ho saktaa he
 Simultaneously, New Delhi has decided to find out the extent of its impact in the Indian Ocean
 pradhanmantri march main maldive, srilanka, morishas or seshals kii yatra karenge
 Their effort will be to link these countries to the structure of Indian security
 yah maldive model kaa vistaar hoga, jisase sanyukt sainya abhyaas or prashikshan kii sambhaavna banegi
 Similarly, New Delhi is now working towards a major effort in Central Asia, while maintaining traditional relations with Russia in the north-west as well
 sambhav he ki pradhanmantri str sahit is kshetra ke pramukh deshon kii ucch stareey yatraaen hon
 Especially Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan
 un saanskrithik sambandhon kaa bhi pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he, jo is kshetra main islamic daur se bhi pehle ke yug ke hon, iskaa ishaara us yug se he, jisamen durgam bhu-bhaag hone ke baavjood vyapaar or pargaman khub phala-phula tha
 If there is one area for which the Modi government's plans are still under construction, it is West Asia
 iageies ke badhate asar ke saath vahaan kii pechida suraksha sthiti ko dekhte hue, south block kaa drushtikon yah he ki vahaan america ko netritv karne diya jaae or aise kisi bhi vivaadaaspad nirnay se bachaa jaae, jo santulan bigaad saktaa ho
 This was the reason that the demand of BJP thinkers to change the vote on Palestine and be decisively in favor of Israel has been temporarily turned down
 badi shaktiyaan or pashchimspasht rup se modi kii yojanaon ke centre main america he
 By expressing a desire to address American concerns, especially economic concerns, the government hopes to benefit from the developed world — as many issues, from nuclear accountability bottlenecks to liberalizing FDI conditions, remain the same for other countries
 Huh
 iske alaava, america ke saath kareebi sambandh gahare str par khufia suchanaaen saajha karne ke liye bhi aavashyak he, jo aatankwaad virdohi karravaayiyon ke liye mahatvapurn he
 But much attention is focused on attracting the best businesses in priority economic sectors
 dilli main sabhi bhartiya mishan pramukhon kii haal main hui baithak ke baad, videsh mantralay sabhi mishan pramukhon ke liye kiye jane vaale kaaryon kii suchi taiyaar kar rahaa he, jo mul rup se bhartiya rajdooton or ucchayuktaon ko apane-apane sambandhit deshon main visheshgyata ke un kshetron kii pahchaan sakriy dhang se karne kaa kaary saunpegi, jo kshetra modi ke gharelu agenda ke liye madadgaar ho sakate hai
 It is for this reason that a study has been done before Modi's visit to Germany in April to find out how the work of cleaning the Rhine river can become a model for cleaning the Ganges
 aisa mana jaataa he ki bharat main antat: isi model par kaam kiya jayega
 Apart from adopting one or two smart city projects, Germany has also been identified for partnership in solar rooftop scheme
 isi yatra ke dauraan modi jis duusare desh kaa daura karenge, vah france he, or use raksha kshetra main 'mek in india' pahal ko protsaahit karne ke liye lakshith kiya ja rahaa he
 At the political level, the idea is to go beyond the complex structure of the European Union (EU) and take bilateral initiatives with major EU power centers such as France and Germany — even including Spain in this list
 is
 purab dekho nitiis kshetra main china kii sthapit shreshthata or uske badhate prabhaav se utpann hone vaali suraksha chintaaon ko dekhte hue yahaan ranneetik saavdhaaniyaan sarvopari ho jaati hai
 According to sources, a big change under the Modi government has been that it wants to reduce the barriers to trade with China and has instructed the authorities to devise a way that India stops fearing Chinese investment
 
 audyogic parkon kii sthapana aisa hi ek udhaaharan he
 While that effort is still ongoing, India itself is increasing its contacts with China's neighbors
 vah vahaan dirghakaalin aarthik sahyog ke lihaaj se swayan ko ek saumy or behatar vikalp ke rup main sthapit karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 This is why South Korea as well as Japan are emerging as focal points as future investors in India
 haalanki, dakshin purv asia main chunauti vishwasaneey vikalp pradaan karne kii he
 Neither has India made rapid enough progress on connectivity projects such as the trilateral highway with Myanmar and Thailand; Nor has expressed any intention of strengthening defense partnerships with smaller countries in the region
 is morche par china ko bhadakne se rokane ke liye upie sarkaar ne ek sashankit niti apana rakhi thi
 Then, balancing it with China's economic adjustment through the terms of the ASEAN Regional Free Trade Agreement — the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will be an even greater challenge
 vaanijya mantralay ko ashanka he ki is samjhaute ke madhyam se china uske bazaaron main kahin zyada mukt pahunch praapt kar legaa, haalanki andruni sutara kehete hai ki baaten us mode par pahunch chuki hai, jisamen bharat samjhauta maanane se inkaar karne vaala ekmaatr desh najar aa saktaa he, or use sheeghra hi is bare main koi faisla lenaa hoga
 That is why close economic relations with China have to be balanced with a strong security framework and this is a very delicate task
 samay-seemaa par kaam puraa karne ke alaava, modi sarkaar apni purab main kaary niti par bhi puraa jor de rahi he
 Liaison to Indian Diaspora The island is the tiniest and most remote French-speaking island in the Indian Ocean

 But it is still a French sovereign territory
 isaki aabaadi kaa acha-khaasaa hissaa bhartiya mul kaa he
 It is an almost forgotten cultural contact, which Prime Minister Modi is ready to exploit
 do maheene baad jab modi france kaa daura karenge, to paris main ek bhaashan ke jariye is sampark ko saadhaa jayega, jiskaa sidhaa prasaaran is sudur dweep main bhi hoga
 It is believed that BJP general secretary Ram Madhav has already engaged in this work and is solving the nuances of this live telecast
 modi daur main videsh niti rashtriya hit ko aage badhaane kaa saadhaaran-sa maamla nahin he
 Now foreign policy is also retaining that Indian identity, on the basis of which interests are built
 yah aisi yojana he, jisamen reunion dweep main rahane vaale kuch lakh bhartiya mul ke logon ko bhi mahatvapurn rajnatik takat mana ja rahaa he
 Therefore, behind the loud applause of Madison Square Garden or Sydney lies a simple fact — India's international population is being organized under Modi's leadership
 yahaan tak aate-aate, bijepi ke sabhi puraane apravasi bhartiya sanghathan, jaise oversij frends of bijepi, bemaani bana die gaye hai
 Modi strongly believes that when the overseas Indian people will unite around him, his halo as a Prime Minister will grow
 yah najariya unke purvavartiyon se bhinn he, jo videshi netaaon ke saath majboot vyaktigat sambandh banane ke liye bahut mehnat karte the
 On the other hand, Modi is keen to give a political impression that he is not only the Prime Minister of India, but also the voice of all Indians
 yah spasht rajnatik koshish he, jiskaa netritv bijepi kar rahi he, jo videshon main sthit bhartiya manchon main apane asar kaa prayog yah tay karne main kar rahi he ki party ke kriyalap sarkaar ke saath kadamtal karen
 And where it is difficult to find very large numbers of the immigrant Indian community, there is an effort to set up friendship forums and strengthen them through party contacts
 is bich, videsh niti maamalon ke partigat paksh kaa dhyaan ab bhartiya saanskrithik sambandh parishad ke punargathan par kendrit he
 That is, there are plans to produce programs where Yoga, Ramayana and Vedas have influence and reach

 The slowing down of the US economy has led to the decline in the prices of consumer goods, especially crude oil in the world market, which is definitely a relief for the Indian economy
 sarkaar ne jahaan ek taraf udyogon ko sandesh diya he ki aarthik sudhaaron ko teji se aage badhaayaa jaayegaa vahiin rigerv bank ne udyogon ko aashwast kiya he ki bazaar main nakadi kii tangi nahin hone di jaayegi or kisi bhi pratikul paristhiti ke saamne aane par vah turant kadam uthaayegaa

 Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia also said that the Indian economy is strong and said that it is driven by domestic demand, our market will soon stabilize even if the US rating is low
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar kowshik basu ne kaarobaar kii shuruyaat main share bazaar main ai giravat ko ‘ghabrahat main hui pratikriya’ bataaya or kaha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha kii vruddhi kii raftaar yathaavat bani rahegi or iske liye koi nitigat hastkshep kii jarurat nahin he
 The domestic stock market initially recovered after a sharp decline on Monday, while gold rose by Rs 460 to Rs 25,230 per 10 grams

 As the stir in political corridors about the Lok Sabha elections is gaining momentum, the statements of the leaders are getting more and more sharp
 congress mahasachivdigvijay sinhane kaha he ki kiparty ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kabhi nahin kaha ki ve pradhanmantri nahin bananaa chaahate hai
 In an interview to a TV channel, Digvijay Singh said that the media misrepresented Rahul Gandhi's statement
 digvijay ne kaha, 'unhone bas itnaa kaha tha ki ve party ke liye kaam karnaa chahenge or desh ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon par zyada dhyaan denge
 This does not mean that he does not want to become Prime Minister
 'digvijay singh ne aage kaha, 'samay or sahi avasar aane dijie
 Why understand more than what he said? Digvijay said, 'if the public gives a clear majority or the Congress emerges as the largest party with enough seats, then the final decision will depend on them (rahul Gandhi)
 'digvijay singh ne kaha ki congress sansadeey dal yah nirnay karegaa ki uskaa netaa koun hoga

 ouch!!!a photo posted by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) onaug 13, 2016 at 1:33pm PDT The spectators were very happy during the Test being played between India and Australia in Pune when off-spinner Jayant Yadav bolted the dangerous batsman David Warner of the opposition team
 haalanki unki yah khushi zyada der nahin tik pai or warner ko ampaire ne note out qaraar diya
 Running in excellent form, Warner is considered to be Australia's most dangerous batsman in the series, but he managed to avoid Jayant's mistake
 is gend par australia team ke khate main 5 ran jude so alag
 The incident occurred during the first hour of the first day
 pich ke mizaaj ko bhaanpate hue viraat kohli ne shuruyaat main hi spin gendbaajon ko atake par laga diya
 The first over of the innings was bowled by Ishant Sharma, while from the second over, Virat gave his trump card
 aswin ko akraman par laga diya
 With both left-handed batsmen at the crease, Virat handed the bowling to another off-spinner Jayant Yadav in the ninth over
 wicket se jayant turn or kabhi-kabhi oochaal paane main bhi kaamyaab ho rahe the
 On the last ball of his fourth over (15th over of the innings), he bowled round the leg, dodging Warner
 lekin yah kya
 
 
 The umpire called the ball a no ball before the spectators could celebrate well
 darasal gend phenkate samay jayant yadav kaa pair krij se kaaphi aage nikal gaya tha
 The umpire called the ball Noble
 is gend par boy ke rup main chaar ran or nobal ke rup main ek ran ke saath australia ke khate main paanch ran jud gaye
 If the Indian team had taken out Warner's wicket in the first hour, then the guest could have put pressure on the team but the opportunity was missed due to Jayant's Noble
 ghatana pehle din ke pehle ghante ke dauraan kii he
 Sensing the mood of the pitch, Virat Kohli put the spin bowlers on the attack in the beginning
 pari kaa pehla over eshanth sharma ne phenkaa jabaki duusare over se hi viraat ne apane trump card aar
 Put Ashwin on the attack
 krij par donon baayen haath ke ballebaaj hone ke kaaran nauven over main viraat ne ek anya of spinner jayant yadav ko gendbaaji saunp di
 Jayant was able to get a turn and sometimes a bounce from the wicket

 But what is this
 
 
 darshak acchhee tarah khushi manaa pate, iske pehle hi ampaire ne is gend ko no ball qaraar diya
 Actually, while throwing the ball, Jayant Yadav's leg went far ahead of the crease
 ampaire ne gend ko nobal qaraar diya
 On this ball, Australia's account added five runs with four runs as Boy and one run as Noble
 bhartiya team yadi pehle hi ghante main warner kaa wicket nikaal leti to mehmaan team par dabaav bana sakati thi lekin yah mauka jayant kii nobal ke kaaran haath se nikal gaya

 Due to worsening economic conditions, he appealed to Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and two mps Deepender Hooda and Naveen Jindal for financial help

 saamaajik kaaryakarta shalini kahati hai ki isse brands ambesder ko bhi phayda hota he, kyonki unki khud kii bhi branding hoti he
 He is reaching from door to door, but it is also important to see how much he contributes to the social issue he has been elected to reach
 lakhon icchhuk chaatr apane abhibhavakon ke lakhon rupye koching lene main kharch kar daalate hai taaki iity kii pravesh pariksha se 'paar' paa saken, haalanki mote taur par sau main se mahaj ek hi safal ho paata he
 In comparison, a top university like Harvard of America receives barely ten applications for every available seat
 jaahir taur par, iity santhaan icchhuk yuvaaon or unke abhibhavakon kii ankhon ke taare bane hue hai
 Unfortunately, there are cracks in this beautiful image
 kuch samay pehle iati-bombai ke purv chaatr jairam ramesh ne iity ke staff ko doum darje kaa qaraar diya tha, lekin mana tha ki chaatr bahut achche hai
 Students have similar views about Chetan Bhagat, another IIT alumnus who is popular as a novelist
 lekin narayan murti (ek anya purv chaatr) kaa maananaa he ki iity ke chaatr gunvattta main kamjor hai ; ve kehete hai ki unamem se sirf 20 pratishat chaatr hi thik hai
 Worse, the prestigious Times Education Supplement did not consider a single IIT to be among the top 200 institutions in the world
 aise main logon kaa yah pataa lagaana swaabhaavik he ki kya iity sansthaanon kaa str vastav main gir gaya he
 Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal has no doubt that all iits are top-level
 unki najar main bharat kii kshamtaayen itani adhik hai ki desh main kai or iity santhaan ho sakate hai
 They have already increased the number of these institutions from 6 to 15
 yahi vichaar bharat ke gyaan ayog ke 
 The jar is of Sam Pitroda
 sach kya he? iity ke aadhe chaatr ab anusuchit jati / janajati or obisi aarakshan ke tahat daakhila lete hai
 The ratio of students and staff has decreased from 6: 1 to 12: 1
 kakshaon kaa aakaar, jo kabhi 50 se zyada nahin hota tha, ab kai baar 200 se bhi zyada ho jaataa he
 It is the rule that the faculty should be selected on the basis of reservation, but it was never strictly enforced
 yah bhi hakeekat he ki sanyukt pravesh pariksha (jeii) kaa tod dhundh liya gaya he
 If you want proof, then you should go to Kota in Rajasthan
 yah bhi sach he ki kaaphi chaatr chote shaharon se aa rahe hai, jinako angreji kii maamuli jaankaree hoti he
 Not all of them are able to overcome this deficiency
 kya in karkon ne iity sansthaanon kii gunvattta ko prabhavit kiya he?iity sansthaanon ke kai nideshak jinase maine baat kii he, unhen ummid he
 They claim that they are able to attract good quality staff
 unhen yah bhi ummid he ki pravesh prakriya main badlaav se jeii kii kai khamiyaan dur ho sakati hai
 But institutions of higher education need three fundamental freedoms: the freedom to decide who they will teach, who will teach, and what to teach
 sarkaar isamen dakhal nahin detii ki iity main kya padhaayaa ja rahaa he, lekin usne faikalti ke chayan ke bare main niyam jari kar die hai
 More than that, it does not give IIT any freedom to decide who they will teach
 yah sarkaar kii niti he ki vah schuli shiksha kii 12 varsh tak ghor andekhi kii purti iity se kare
 Successful universities like Harvard have all the three freedoms that quality institutions require
 ve sarvshereshth chaatro ko aakarshith karte hai, or kam yogya lekin dhani chaatro ko bhi daakhila dete hai, jo unki sansthagat puunji main yogadan karte hai
 Harvard's estimated institutional capital of Rs 85,000 crore
 he, kisi bhi iity ke paas iskaa hajaarwaan hissaa bhi nahin he
 Harvard uses ISROCM for high quality research and provides education for poor but deserving students almost free of cost
 narayan murti ke bacchon ne harvard main shiksha lee, lekin ve agar 100 garib chaatro kii shiksha kaa kharch uthaane ko raji hote, to bhi iity main pravesh nahin paa sakate the
 The results are clear: Harvard is at the peak and IIT institutions have dropped out of the race
 nideshak chaahe jo kahen lekin agar sarkaar unki gatividhiyon par usee moorkhtapurna dhang se najar banaae rahati he, jaisi vah karti aa rahi he, tab tak yah sandigdh hi rahegaa ki ve behatar kaamkaaj karne yogya ho sakate hai
 No reputed university takes entrance exams in the same way that IIT institutes take
 udhaaharan ke liye, eseti score na to chaatr ke chayan ke liye nirnaayak he or na hi vah chayan main koi jaruri pahalu hi he
 Top institutions need the most autonomy
 agar sarkaar iity ko akelaa chhodkar schuli shiksha kii gunvattta sudhaarney par kaam kare, to iity santhaan bhi utkrisht ho sakate hai

 asipi (krime) shamsher singh ne bataaya tha ki ladki pichley kuch dinon se saamaanya vyavhaar nahin kar rahi thi, jab padosiyon ne usase poochtacha kii to usne yon utpeedan ke bare main bataaya
 The neighbors then informed the police
 adhikari ne bataaya, 'ladki apane pita ke saath pataudi kshetra main rahati thi
 After his mother's death, his father had been sexually assaulting him for the past few months
 'saath hi bataaya, 'ladki ne bataaya ki uske pita sharaab pine ke baad har raat uske saath rape karata tha
 Last week, the accused raped her twice
 ' ladki ko vahaan se nikaalkar counselling centre bheja gaya he
 Recently, a similar case was reported in Attari village of Thana Jarcha area of noida district of Uttar Pradesh
 jahaan ek 16 varshiya kishori ke saath uske sage chachaa ne kai maah tak dushkarm kiya
 The incident was reported when the teenager became pregnant
 use dilli ke akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 SP villager Vineet Jaiswal had told that the health of the teenager living in Attari village of Thana Jarcha area suddenly worsened
 kishori kii nani ne use dilli ke ames aspataal main bhartee karaayaa, vahaan par jaanch ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki vah garbhvatee he
 Also, the SP had said that when the teenager's grandmother asked him, he told that his uncle has been raping her for several months
 unhone bataaya tha ki is maamle main thana jarcha main kishori kii nani ne mukadmaa darj karaayaa he
 Police have arrested the accused uncle by registering a report of the incident

 Video clippings of the quarrel between the two were sent via mobile phone to senior officials

 jaan abraham abhinay ke saath saath acchhee scaching bhi kar lete he
 When director Abbas Tyrewala was explaining the character of this film to Jaan, Jaan was shaping his character on paper
 abbaas ne jab yah sketch dekha to vah kaaphi achambhit ho gayi or unhone jaan ko nayaa naam dete huye unhen ‘‘jhootha jaan’’ kah daalaa
 Jaan told 'when Abbas was telling me about my role in this film, that this character is not a hot and sexy character that i have played in my previous films
 to usee charitra ko apane dimag main laakar main use kaagaj par ukerne laga
 i think it's sweeter than me
