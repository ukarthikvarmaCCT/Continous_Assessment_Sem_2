 swytt nikaayon ke sambandh main sansad main aaj pesh apni report main kaig ne kaha ki visheshgy samitiyon kii siforeeshon ke khilaaf jate hue bhi maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay (echaradi) ne hyderabad ke institute aaf chartered financial analist aaf india (isiemeai), faridabad ke maanav rachana international vishvavidhyalay, elahabaad main nehru gram bharti vishvavidhyalay or rajasthan ke modi institute aaf ajukeshan and research ko pakkaa dimd vishvavidhyalay kaa darja de diya
 As per the rules, the status of a pucca deemed university is given only to those institutions which have completed at least 10 years of its establishment

 The deemed university then considers the UGC recommendations and forward the recommendations for the status of deemed university to the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 parvej musharraf ke saath pehali mulaakaat main manmohan singh ne general ko rajyasatta ke istemaal ke bare main ek professoranuma bhaashan diya tha
 He had said, we are both leaders of our respective countries by accident
 ham jahaan pahunch gaye hai, vahaan hamaare hone kii koi ummid nahin kii gai thi
 Now Musharraf could have raised controversy over this, as anyone who takes a commission in Pakistan's army as an officer knows that he is the highest candidate for the country
 ham nahin jaanate ki unhone aisa kiya yaa nahin
 But return to the serious matter, the professor told the general that holding public office is like public trust
 aap ise hasil nahin kar sakate or is bare main kuch kar bhi nahin sakate
 So, what he meant was that whatever be our own political capital, let us move forward on the path of peace process

 Singh would have also asked himself on several occasions during his second term
 khaskar tab jab unki party, 10 janpath or uske kamisaaron ne unki satta ko lagaataar nasht kiya tha
 He recognized his reputation and legacy so much and reduced the status of the Prime Minister's Office to such an extent that the badly-disposed voters went to Narendra Modi, who was promising an almighty PMO in the style of Gujarat

 But i will tell you one thing, which i said to him with a little audacity
 maine unase kaha tha ki itihaas unhen kai baton ke liye doshi tehraayega, lekin ek aisi rajnatik vyavastha main jahaan haroonges nae-nae vichaar hafte main do baar kii gati se nikalakar aate hai, unhen is baat kaa shrey nahin degaa ki unhone kai buree chizon se hamen bachaaya
 He defied my point and deferred it at that time
 lekin ab jab ve bhrashtachar or aapraadhik vishwasabhang karne ke aarope main adaalat ke saamne pesh hone kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, ve is baat par vichaar karenge ki chaahe vah naregaa ho yaa shiksha kaa adhikaar yaa khaadya suraksha vidheyak ho, in bure vichaaron se ladgaye main yaa inase hone vaale nuksaan ko kam karne ke liye unhone apana kitna sara vakt, urja or rajnatik puunji jaaya kii thi
 On the Land Acquisition Act, he had fully given up arms to Rahul Gandhi, who was assured by his Kautilyans that this could be his party's ticket for a third term

 The first setback was when his party rejected an agreement with his Pakistani counterpart to resume the process of stalled negotiations in Sharm el-sheikh since 26 / 11

 He expressed frustration and annoyance to his close colleagues that his environment minister writes letters and leaks them, taking a different approach to his policy on controversial issues

 In the Prime Minister's Office he was not allowed to keep and elect his own people, forced to remove his loyal media advisor, and it would be unilateral to say that the files were taken to Sonia, on major decisions, here Till then, administrative appointments were also approved

 He was not 'maun Mohan'
 apane pehle kaarykaal main bhi unhone isaki jhalak dikhalaai thi, jaisaa ki parmaanu qaraar par hamane dekha tha
 However, in the second term, he took a silent fast and weakened himself, the government and his party
 unhone bagaiyr lade apni naitik or sanvaidhanik satta kaa samarpan kyon kar diya? unhone aksar yah baat kabool kii thi ki ve ek niyukt pradhanmantri hai, nirvaachit nahin
 But why did he not insist on contesting the Lok Sabha elections, especially in 2009? i think his party high command was happy to see him in this way - bureaucrat-like, obedient prime minister, serving the tolerant of everything
 lekin agar unhone jor diya hota ki unhen loksabhaa main chunakar aana he, to unki party baadhya hokar unhen ek surakshit seat detii
 For now, it would be useful to have a look at what Fellowes at Carnegie and former editor-in-chief of foreign policy magazine Moises Naeem wrote in his book The End of Power: Why Being in Charge Before What It Used to Be
 ve likhte hai, ''satta ab sab nahin dilwati jo pehle dilvaaya karti thi
 "the power is falling away
 itnaa hi nahin, 24 ghante ke tivi, soshal media or real time kii taanaashaahee ke saath, ''satta ke khilaadi aksar ab apni galatiyon kii zyada andhadhundh or zyada asann keemat chukaate hai
 "UPA won its second and more massive mandate in 2009, sparked by its victory over the nuclear deal
 phir naeem kii vyakhya ke mutabik, unki satta, unka adhikaar or rajnatik puunji teji se chhijane lagi
 By 2010, he was paralyzed and helpless
 jab tak unki buniyadi satta or haisiyat ko behaal karne ke liye unki seva-sharten nahin badali jaatin, tab unhen chhodie kii dhamkee de deni chahie thi
 i am sure Sonia and Rahul would have agreed
 ve is kaam ke liye pranab par bharosa karne vaale nahin the
 He chose not to do so, that is the real disappointment and it would be reasonable to investigate why he did it

 'mani' dikshit vah shaks the, jinhen unhone rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ke pad ke liye chunaa tha
 He did not get tired of telling me that he had worked with every Prime Minister and Manmohan Singh was the most selfless person among them
 dikshit badakismati se unke kaarykaal ke shuruaati vakt main hi guzar gaye, varanaa hamen unki samaj or gyaan kaa laabh miltaa ki aakhir dow
 Why did Singh not stand for his position? ab jab ham apane sabase vinamr, sankochi, ujle or bauddhik pradhanmantri ko adaalaton ke chakkar lagaate dekhenge, hamen unase ek kathor sawaal poochna hoga: kya kabhi unhone khud ko us kasuti par parkhaa, jo unhone musharraf ke liye tay kii thi?agar unhone aisa nahin kiya, to kya phir unhone apni saamanti vafadariyon ko‚Äîparivaar ke prati‚Äîus saarvajanik bharose se upar rakhaa? shaayad unhone aisa hi sochaa
 And even though his worst enemies would not believe that the court would finally get anything in relation to him, and i still think that history would rate him more than journalism with mercy, but he would be remembered as such a great leader, Who deprived himself of real greatness by placing his feudal loyalties above the demands of public trust

 iske alawa ek email bhi jari kiya he jis par kisi bhi apradhi kii jaankaree estf ko di ja sakati he
 In view of the increasing crime graph in Haryana, STF is resorting to information technology along with social media

 People's participation will play an important role in this plan of Haryana STF
 in donon madhyamon se koi bhi vyakti kisi bhi apradhi kii jaankaree de saktaa he
 The police believe that many times a criminal flourishes at a small level in an area, but the police is not aware of it
 jabaki ab is number or mail ke sahare koi bhi vyakti kisi bhi aise vyakti kii jaankaree de saktaa he jo gaiyrkanoonee kaam karata ho
 This number and mail will be checked 24 hours on behalf of Gurugram STF

 People have also been assured by the STF that the identity of the person they will share will be kept confidential
 vahiin aise saahsee kaam ke liye estf kii taraf se jaankaree dene vaale ko inaam ke taur par sammaan raashi di jaaegi
 The STF IG has also warned people who share incorrect information on such numbers and mail
 unhone kaha ki shikaayat milane ke baad uski jaanch karke aage kii karrwai kii jaaegi or yadi koi phek kol karegaa yaa juthi soochna share karegaa to uske khilaaf bhi sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 STF was formed by the Haryana government to curb crime in Haryana
 iske baad se kai nami badmaash task force ke haath lage or unhen salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaaya gaya
 Leaders and vips continue to use planes and helicopters, but sometimes the kind of negligence about their safety raises many questions

 Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of jaish-e-mohammed, the culprit of the martyrdom of 40 soldiers in Pulwama, is he really dead or is it just a rumor
 ye sawaal ravivaar shaam se hi soshal media par gum rahaa he
 However, this has not been confirmed nor is India's security agencies accepting it
 lekin ek or pakistan ke is tarah ke pantare jari hai to vahi bharat bhi har tarah se mustaid he
 It is reported that Jaish kingpin died due to failure of both kidneys
 jabaki kai media reports main ye atakalein bhi joro par he ki masood ajahar bharat ke dwaara kii gai balakot main air strike se itnaa buree tarah ghayal hua tha ki uske aakhirkaar dam tod diya
 However, all this is speculation, there is no confirmation
 khabaron ko hawa isliye bhi mili kyonki kuch din pehle hi uske panaahagaar pakistan ne saaf kaha tha ki masood ajahar ‚Äòsahab‚Äô behad biimaar hai
 Where is Masood Azhar? On 26 February, India had terrorized the terrorist bases of Masood Azhar in Balakot, Pakistan with its Mirage 2000 fighter planes
 us air strike ke baad se hi masood ajahar par jabardast suspence barkaraar he, uske baad se naa use kisi ne dekhne kaa daawa kiya or naa hi sunne kaa
 Yes, the minister of Pakistan definitely kept giving half the incomplete information about him
 ye bhi ek badi vajah he ki masood ajahar kii maut kii khabaron par atakalbaaji kaa bazaar sajane laga
 However, jaish-e-mohammed in one of its statements has denied the news completely wrong
 mantri ne kaha tha ‚Äì sahab biimaar hanmasood ajahar pakistan main he isaki tasdik to khud vahaan ke videsh mantri shah kuraishi ne hi kar di thi
 It was said that Masood Azhar is in his home in Pakistan and is so ill that he is not in a condition to get out of the house
 chaukanna he iesaisutron kii maane to pakistan khufia agency iesai ne masood ajahar ko rawalpindi ke military aspataal se nikaal liya he
 Masood has been shifted to an intelligence base at Kotghni near Bahawalpur
 iesai ne is harakat ko 17 yaa 18 farvari ko hi anjaam diya he
 Sources are also saying that after the attack and pressure from India, Masood's security has been strengthened by the army and ISI

 Chidambaram had said, in fact we are underestimating the resources, especially the ability to raise resources
 chunki gaiyr-yojanagat vyay ko kam karnaa mushkil he, at: kar-jidipi anupaat ko nishchit taur par badhaayaa janaa chahie
 For this, along with taxation on luxury items, succession tax can also be levied

 According to HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, from 2021, phd degree has been made mandatory for promotion of Assistant Professor (selection Grade) in colleges
 aapako bataa den ki isse purv post grajuation kii degree or rashtriya yogyata pariksha (net) ko college or vishvavidhyalay main ek assistant professor pad ke liye paryaapt mana jaataa tha
 Thus, this step of the Ministry of Human Resource Development will reduce the importance of NET exam
 haalanki, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantriprakash jaavdekarne kaha ki keval faillowship kaaryakramon main pravesh ke liye pariksha barkaraar rakhi jaaegi

 The Ministry stated that publication of research work in academic journals was no longer a criterion for promotion, however, teachers could continue research
 mantralay ne aage kaha ki shikshakon ke liye 2021 se collejon or vishvavidhyalayon main assistant professor pad ke liye pramotion yaa pratyaksh bhartee ke liye shikshakon ke liye piechdi degree anivaary hogi
 What else did the Ministry say- The incentives to teachers given in the pre-2010 rules and subsequent amendments have been retained

 - There will be a provision for promotion up to professor level in colleges for the first time
 - sheersh 500 vaishvik ranking main vishvavidhyalay / santhaan se piechdi degree dharakon ke liye vishvavidhyalayon or collejon main sahaayak prophessoron kii bhartee ke liye vishesh praavdhaan kiye gaye hai

 They will go on a rampage with any woman in a situation of profanity
 apni marji se ghoomane yaa cinema haul aane-jane waalon ko pakadana unka makasad nahin hoga
 People will not be disturbed without reason
 They say that if someone is harassed without reason, they want to make it clear that no one is harassed
 iske alaava ve kehete hai ki kinhinmanchalon ko pakadaneke baad unhen chetaya jayega
 Not that their mouth will be blackened or rubbed
 iske alaava ve unke parijanon ko bhi bulaane kaa kaam karenge
 The task of convincing the boys and students will be that they would like to convince the boys and students who do such acts that manhood is not meant to make fun of anyone

 chidambaram ke bete karti chidambaram kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 Actually, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has unearthed Karti's benami assets
 idi ne jaanch ke dauraan karti ke dastavej, email or hardware sij kiye hai
 According to sources, Karthi's email has revealed Karthi's benami properties in the UK
 idi ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya he ki karti chidambaram se jude maamalon kii jaanch ke dauraan unhone karti ke property dealer loren mooni or sibian reddy ke bich email ke bare main pataa lagaaya
 Karthi Chidambaram was also marked in this alleged email
 sutron ke mutabik idi ne sampattiyon ke dastavejon ke aadhaar par aarope lagaaya he ki karti ne apni benami sampatti ko banaae rakhane ke liye dealer ko sampatti ke liye 1000 pound kii rakam di thi
 At the same time, the investigating agency has attached the challan for the rent of the land acquired through the property dealer of Karti
 sutron kaa daawa he ki in achal sampattiyon ko gaiyrkanoonee taur se kamaaye gaye dhan se kharida gaya tha
 This is part of the overseas assets that ED has tracked
 vahiin karti chidambaram apane pita ke saath kai duusare sandigdh len-dein ke maamalon main bhi idi ke radar par hai
 The names of p Chidambaram and his family have surfaced in a number of cases including Aircel Maxis, INX Media, Diageo Scotland and Katara Holdings
 shell companiyon kii pahachaanaiske saath hi jaanch agency ne kai aisi shell companiyon kii pahchaan kii he, jo bharat or videsh main panjikrut hai
 One of these was a shell company investment of over Rs 300 crore
 purv mantri ke bete karti chidambaram ke swaamitv vaali shell company ko british virgin island sthit ek company se bhi kaaphi bhugtan mila tha or yah company panama papers main bhi saamne aa chuki he
 Sources said the money in shell companies was given to Chidambaram's family and he was used for personal expenses
 idi dastavejon ke mutabik, in shell companiyon main jamaa rakam kaa istemaal pi chidambaram or karti chidambaram ke nijee kharch ko puraa karne, 2 darjan se zyada videshi bank khaaton ko kholane or unamem raashi jamaa karne ke alaava malaysia, spain, euke aadi main kai sampattiyaan kharidne ke liye kiya gaya
 However Karthi has denied the allegations
 karti chidambaram ne kaha, 'main kisi bhi shell company ke bare main nahin jaanata or aarope niraadhaar hai
 ' bhartiya nausena kii pandubbi INS sindhughosh brihaspativaar der raat mumbai ke dakshini tat par haadase kaa shikaar ho gai
 The submarine crashed into the fishing boat when it was coming upstream
 is haadase ke dauraan pandubbi kaa periscope kshatigrast ho gaya
 Currently, the submarine has returned to Mumbai Harbor and is undergoing repairs
 nausena ke mutabik is haadase main pandubbi ko koi bahut zyada nuksaan nahi hua he
 According to Navy spokesman Captain DK Sharma, the accident occurred during the Tropex exercise
 ye yuddh abhyaas ghupp andheri raat main ho rahaa tha or aisi ghatnaon kii ashanka se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Naval headquarters has informed the concerned officials about this
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bhi pichley saal sindhughosh haadase kaa shikaar hote-hote bachi thi
 In the second naval submarine INS Sindhuratna, two naval personnel were killed in a gas spill last year
 vahiin 2013 main hue ek bhayanak haadase main INS sindhurakshak main teen adhikari sahit 15 nausainikon kii maut ho gai thi

 When the American actor Paul Walker died in a road accident, the feelings of all the celebrities began to reach and be seen through the media
 media ne maahaul aisa banaaya jaise laga ki unki maut kahin rashtriya shok main na tabdeel ho jaae
 Questions arose that thousands of people are dying of hunger in Asia and Africa
 america main saikadon sainik desh kii suraksha main jaan ganvaa rahe hai
 So why are the deaths of Paul Walker, who lives with his dogs and about 100 expensive cars in Santa Barbara, and the sentiments of many more stars being shown on the media for 24 hours
 bharat main is sawaal kaa jawaab sanjay dutt or salmaan khan jaison kaa media kawarej he
 Here Salman Khan himself trampled five people with alcohol
 ek kii maut ho gai chaar ghayal ho gaye
 But by showing the stars' mourning and condolences on Twitter and Facebook, the media aroused sensations in the minds of the common people, not the victim but in favor of the guilty
 is puure prakaran main mujhe rishi kapur kaa twit keval yaad he jisamen likhaa gaya he ki salmaan ke chamache gayak abhijit or film main karier banane kaa sapana rakhane vaale koi ejaj khan ke bevakoofi bhare twit se salmaan khan kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 In Maharashtra, in which Salman Khan is going to court and his house is getting obese on the stars, there are 77 children who die every day due to malnutrition
 kuch log ho saktaa he ise lekhak kaa frustation maane
 But in the statement of the victim, to insist that Salman should get the punishment but he did not get anything
 vahiin, court ke sajaa dene ke baavjood tivi par abdulla shaikh kii salmaan ko maaf karne kii bite chalaanaa, hamaare media or tantra ke halkepan ko ujagar karata he
 This is the side effect of making the air of celebrity sympathy
 jahaan sajaa sunaane vaala court chota ho gaya or doshi kaa kad bada
 On TV, if someone was offering Namaz in favor of Salman Khan, then someone was doing havan
 lekin is prakriya main nyaay ke jariye kaise peediton ko insaaf or taqatvar celibretti ko sajaa mili, iskaa zikr kahin nahin hua
 Imagine where 1277 road accidents occur every day, more than one and a half million people lose their lives in road accidents every year, while in this way, it is shameful for a drunk driver to show condolences on TV
 mana salmaan khan bahut bade actor he, charity se lakhon logon ko phayda pahunchaa rahe hai
 The cases of road accidents have been peddling for years where punishment is not found
 tippaniyan But in this case, Salman had to bear the brunt of being a celebrity
 par hamen ye nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isse unke aparaadh ko maaf nahin kiya ja saktaa he

 Questions arose that thousands of people are dying of hunger in Asia and Africa
 america main saikadon sainik desh kii suraksha main jaan ganvaa rahe hai
 So why are the deaths of Paul Walker, who lives with his dogs and about 100 expensive cars in Santa Barbara, and the sentiments of many more stars being shown on the media for 24 hours
 bharat main is sawaal kaa jawaab sanjay dutt or salmaan khan jaison kaa media kawarej he
 Here Salman Khan himself trampled five people with alcohol
 ek kii maut ho gai chaar ghayal ho gaye
 But by showing the stars' mourning and condolences on Twitter and Facebook, the media aroused sensations in the minds of the common people, not the victim but in favor of the guilty
 is puure prakaran main mujhe rishi kapur kaa twit keval yaad he jisamen likhaa gaya he ki salmaan ke chamache gayak abhijit or film main karier banane kaa sapana rakhane vaale koi ejaj khan ke bevakoofi bhare twit se salmaan khan kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 In Maharashtra, in which Salman Khan is going to court and his house is getting obese on the stars, there are 77 children who die every day due to malnutrition
 kuch log ho saktaa he ise lekhak kaa frustation maane
 But in the statement of the victim, to insist that Salman should get the punishment but he did not get anything
 vahiin, court ke sajaa dene ke baavjood tivi par abdulla shaikh kii salmaan ko maaf karne kii bite chalaanaa, hamaare media or tantra ke halkepan ko ujagar karata he
 This is the side effect of making the air of celebrity sympathy
 jahaan sajaa sunaane vaala court chota ho gaya or doshi kaa kad bada
 On TV, if someone was offering Namaz in favor of Salman Khan, then someone was doing havan
 lekin is prakriya main nyaay ke jariye kaise peediton ko insaaf or taqatvar celibretti ko sajaa mili, iskaa zikr kahin nahin hua

 The answer to this question in India is media coverage of Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan
 yahaan salmaan khan ne khud sharaab ke nashe main paanch logon ko rond daalaa
 One was killed, four were injured
 lekin twitor or fasebuk par sitaron ke vilaap or samvednaaon ko dikhaakar media ne aam logon ke man main peedit ke prati nahin balki doshi ke paksh main samvednaaen jagaa di
 In this entire episode, i only remember Rishi Kapoor's tweet, which mentions that Salman Khan is being hurt by Salman's spunky singer Abhijeet and the idiotic tweet of Ejaz Khan, who dreams of making a career in the film
 jis maharashtra main salmaan khan ke court jane or unke ghaki par sitaron ke jamwaade par obi ho rahi he vahaan har roj kuposhan se 77 bacchon kii maut hoti he
 Some people may consider this to be the author's friction
 lekin peedit ke bayaan main is baat kaa jor dena ki salmaan ko sajaa chaahe jo mili lekin unhen kuch nahin mila
 At the same time, despite the court's sentencing, Abdullah Sheikh's byte of forgiving Salman on TV exposes the lightness of our media and system
 yahi celibretti simpathi kii hawa banane ke said effect he
 Where the court of sentencing got smaller and the height of the convict increased
 tivi par koi salmaan khan ke paksh main namaaj padhata dikhaa to koi havan karata hua
 But in the process, how justice was meted out to the victims and justice to the powerful, there is no mention of this

 Suppose Salman Khan is a very big actor, benefiting millions from charity

 The comments lekin is maamle main kahin na kahin salmaan ko celibretti hone kaa khamiyaja bhi bhugatna padaa
 But we should not forget that their crime cannot be forgiven

 In a country where 70 percent of road accidents are caused by alcohol, in such a punishment, there was a need to create a strong wind in opposition to the Drunken drive, rather than giving a message that if you are a celebrity, then you must drink alcohol from a expensive car

 Xiaomi ke ap ko google play protect ne kiya block
 Suspicion of collecting and tracking data! Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi's track record regarding blotware in smartphones is not good
 smartphone main pehle se instold kai eps hote hai or yugers ko vigyaapan bhi dikhte hai
 a Quick App of the company is given in Xiaomi's smartphone
 is ap ko google play protect ne block karnaa shuru kiya he
 Google Play Protect is a service by Google under which the Google Play Store apps are scanned
 google ne Xiaomi ke is Quick App ko block kiya he
 The reason is that this app can collect and track data from users
 jaahir he data colect karke galat istemaal bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Even if there is no wrong use, this data can be used to make money by giving targeted advertisements
 soshal media par Redmi smartphone yugers ise lekar shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Users are upset and seeking answers from the company
 company ne kaha he ki yugers ko isse pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he or google ke saath baatcheet kii ja rahi he
 Xiaomi has also shunned himself by saying that this could be because the algorithm of Google Play Protect is being changed
 gauratlab he ki Xiaomi ke smartphone main kuch pre instold eps hote hai jinhen aap hataa nahin sakate hai
 Among these, there is also Quick Apps

 The shocking facts have come to light in the investigation of Mehdi Masroor Biswas, arrested in Bengaluru on charges of campaigning for the Iraqi terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIS), through the account 'shamivateness' (@shamiwitness) on micro-blogging site Twitter
 bengaluru ke police kamishnar emen reddy kaa kahana he ki sava lakh main se ab tak kareeb 12,000 aise twit mili hai, jinke jariye mehadi biswas logon ko iesas se judane ke liye prerit kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, some such tweets have also come out, it is clear that Mehdi Masroor Biswas was directly connected with an ISIS fighter present in Iraq and was constantly informing him about the movement of the army
 mehadi masaroor biswas giraftaar ke baad se ab tak pichley 20 din se police hiraasat main hi tha, lekin shuukravaar ko police hiraasat khatm hone ke baad use 16 janvari tak nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 The police is also investigating Biswas's 1
25 million tweet as well as the tweet of 17,000 of his followers
 vaise, police ne biswas par iti act kii vibhinn dhaaraon ke saath-saath mitra rashtron ke khilaaf yuddh chhedane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 Most of the youth of today's generation think that it is better to live alone than to get married
 haalanki is baat par har kisi kaa apana mat ho saktaa he
 This depends on the individual basis
 relationships ke maamle main har koi khushkismat ho aisa nahin hota he
 At times, you get cheated in relationships and are heartbroken
 aise samay main to yahi lagata he ki pyaar main padane se behatar hota ki ham single hi rahete
 If your partner's behavior is bad towards you, he abuses you and wants to keep you in bondage, then it is better that you get out of that relationship
 mana ki yah thodaa mushkil kaam he lekin kisi bure rishte ko kaaphi dinon tak jhelane se behatar he ki aap usase chhutkaaraa paa len
 After this, you may get emotional hurt, financial crisis may arise, but being in a wrong relationship can not give you any happiness
 aise samay main yahi lagata he ki akele rahanaa hi behatar hota
 But do you know what the benefits of living alone can be? 1
 The biggest advantage of being single is that you do not have to dispute with anyone over trivial matters
 2
 There is no restriction on you
 aap single hai to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab he ki aap vah sab karne ke liye aaazaad hanjo aap karnaa chaahate hai
 3
 single hone kaa teesraa bada phayda ye he ki na to aapako kisi kii baaten sunani padati hai or na hi aapkaa dil tuutata he
 The emotional tyranny that happens over and over again ends forever
 4
 While this may seem a bit strange to you, it cannot be denied that you are free to date anyone when you are single
 5
 One advantage of being single is that you can do whatever you want
 aapako ye sochane kii jarurat nahin hoti ki aapke is kaam se kisi ko kya mahasoos ho rahaa he

 Steffi Graf did this feat in 1988

 garmiyaan aa gai hai or aise main ghar se baahar nikalne se pehle zyaadaatar log sanscreen lagaakar hi kadam badhaate hai
 Sunscreen has been used for years
 aisa mana jaataa he ki sanscreen lagaakar nikalne se twachaa, yuvi kirnon ke sidhe sampark main nahin aati he or surakshit rahati he
 But this news may surprise you
 haal main hue ek adhyayan main paaya gaya he ki sanscreen lagane vaale mardon ke napunsak hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 To reduce the effect of UV rays, the chemical elements used in sunscreen can destroy sperm or, consequently, affect their activity
 iske saath hi isamen prayukt kai saamaanya utpaadamahilaon ke hormone projesteron bhi pratikulprabhaav daalate hai
 Due to which the activity of spermatozoa is affected
 ye tatv sperm cells ke saamaanya function ko bhi roak dete hai
 When we apply sunscreen, our skin absorbs that lotion
 jisase ye blad stream main pravesh kar jaataa he
 According to Niels Shakkebeek of the University of Copenhagen, this study is really surprising
 niles ke mutabik, ye parinaam vaaki chintaa main daalane vaale hai or sambhav he ki issenpunsakata or uske kaarnon ko behatar tareeke se samajhanemen madad mili
 Niels and his team investigated the effect of sunscreen on healthy semen
 unhone kai tarah ke sanscreen kaa pareekshan kiya
 The normal process of sperm appeared to be affected in most of the results
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki shukranuon kaa sahi function bahut jaruri he lekin sanscreen main maujuud tatv ise prabhavit kar sakate hai

 purv main sunwaayee ke dauraan teen jajon ne hindu maton or kanoon se uske sambandh ke vibhinn pahaluon par poochtacha kii thi
 Its most important aspect was debated on Friday
 justise bhushan ne parasaran se poocha ki maamle kaa ek pakshakaar janmasthan he to ek sthaan ko kanoon ke anusaar ek vyakti ke taur par pesh karnaa kaise sambhav he, or murtiyon ke alaava or kya hai, ve vidhi adhikaron kii shrenee main kaise aa gayi?parasaran ne rugaved kaa hawala diya, jisamen surya ko bhagwaan mana gaya he, haalanki unki koi murti nahin he, or ek bhagwaan ke taur par ve kanoon ke daayre main aane vaale vyakti hai
 Justice Chandrachud asked the senior advocate whether any person who is worshiped could be brought under the purview of the law
 court main bhagavaanon or unke ishwariya gunon par bahes he, jaise puja kaa strot bhakthi ke liye kendriya strot ho saktaa he, or ek nyaayadhish ne sawaal kiya, is aadhaar par kisi ke janmasthan se judaa koi sthaan kanoon ke antargat aane vaala vyakti ho saktaa he?kya ayodhya main bhagwaan ram kaa koi vanshaj heparasaran yah sabit karne ke liye bahes kar rahe the ki bhagwaan or janmasthan kanoon ke daayre main aate hai, to ek vyakti ke taur par ve sampatti ke maalik ban sakate hai or hindu kanoon ke antargat maamla darj kar sakate hai
 On this, the judges also asked whether any descendant of Lord Rama was still in Ayodhya? Parasaran argued that no idol was compulsory among Hindus, as the Hindu God was not always worshiped in a fixed form, according to news agency IANS
 Some people believe in the formless God
 unhone kedarnath mandir kaa udhaaharan diya, jahaan kisi bhi bhagwaan kii koi murti nahin he
 He argued that therefore the idol is not mandatory to define a temple, whereas the temple is a valid asset
 unhone kaha ki hindu, bhagwaan ram kii puja anadikaal se kar rahe hai, yahaan tak ki murtiyon sthapit karne or unke upar mandir banane se pehle se
 He said that faith is the proof, so birthplace can be brought under the law as a person

 1
 i resigned from Rajya Sabha because i was told that you will not face Punjab
 aisa unhone isliye kaha kyonki agle saal punjab main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 He does not want to be away from his home state after the option has been shifted to the center
 wo ye jaanate hai ki yahaan se gaye to wo vahaan chale jaaenge, jahaan se vaapasi kii ummid nahin
 2
 mujhe pehali baar 17 din pehle amritsar se chunaav ladane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 When the storms blow, Siddhu was killed
 kyonki unhen bharosa he ki unkaapunjabake bazaar main jo bhav he, vah hameshaa chadha hi rahegaa
 Then even with whom he is not
 wo yah behatar tareeke se jaanate hai ki punjab main jabachunavi bisatbichhati he to us par punjab kii janata kise baithaati he
 She does not even allow outsiders to enter
 jetali isaki baangi hai
 3
 panchi bhi udata he to shaam ko wo apane ghar waapas jaataa he
 So you tell me how Sidhu leaves his house? Because continuously (since 2004) after being an MP from Amritsar (not in 2014), he knows better what the Amritsaris have in mind for him
 wo is theory main chal rahe hai ki aadmi chaahe jitna bhi bada kyon na ho jaae use apni jameen nahin chhodani chahie
 Sidhu knows this better that only the soil of Punjab will get him everything
 4
 When the wave of Modiji came, the opponent was submerged as well as Sidhu
 yah kahkar siddhu ne spasht massej de diya he ki jabase modi aaen hai unka bantaadhaar ho gaya he
 When Modi ji came, his ticket was cut
 bachi khuchi ummid thi cabinet main shaamil hone kii, jo khatm ho gai duusare sabase 'bade badlaav' ke baad
 5
 mujhe pad kii ichha nahin he
 But i will not break the trust of Amritsaris
 ye line bolkar unhone sidhe-sidhe amritsariyon ko saadhaa he yaa yun kahen ki punjabiyon ko saadhaa he
 He is aware that his missing posters have also been posted in Amritsar and the margin of victory was also steadily decreasing (only 6858)
 isliye wo ye bataanaa chaahate the ki main apni jad nahin chhod saktaa or unka vishwaas bhi
 6
 jahaan punjab kaa hit hoga main vahiin jaaoongaa
 This was the punchline of the entire PC
 unhone ye saaf massej de diya he ki wo aakhir kahaan jane vaale hai
 Which will eradicate intoxication from Punjab, remove corruption and bring peace to the farmers

 In view of the ever increasing pollution in the capital, the Transport Ministry has decided to make BS6 compulsory from April 1
 haalanki, sarkaar kaa ye faisla abhi sirf dilli ke liye he
 It is planned to be implemented throughout the NCR in 2019
 jaanaleva ho chuke pradooshan se nipatane ke liye sarkaar ne yah faisla liya he
 Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said that pollution is the biggest problem in the country today, the condition of the capital Delhi is also known by everyone, so the government has decided to make BS6 compulsory from April 1
 petroleum export narendra taneja ke mutabik bies 6 ke lagu hone ke baad dilli main pradooshan str ko kam karne main madad milegi
 Taneja said that BS-6 diesel contains polluting hazardous substances 70 to 75% less than BS-4
 narendra taneja kaa kahana he ki gaadiyaan bies 6 nahin hone kii vajah se tatkaal iskaa puraa phayda to nahin milegaa lekin iske baavjood pradooshan main kami hogi
 Why took the decision? In November 2017, the Petroleum Ministry had issued a statement saying that Delhi has only 6 months to shift from BS-4 Norms to BS-6
 dilli or usase sate ilaakon main pradooshan ke badhate str ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne bies-6 eendhan ko do saal pehle hi lagu karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Under BS-6 fuel, the amount of sulfur in petrol and diesel is limited to one tenth of a million (PPM)
 haalanki bies-6 gaadiyaan 2020 se hi aaengi
 What is BS-6 Bharat Stage Emission Standards (BS-6) is also known as Bharat Stage (BS)

 They also have to reduce emissions of perticulate matter by 5 times more than the current standard

 One lakh crore rupees may have to be spent in this
 isamen auto industry ko 30 se 40 fisadi kharch karnaa pad saktaa he
 This expense will increase the pressure on the pockets of companies, which can directly affect the common man's pocket
 petroleum export taneja kehete hai ki bies-6 petrol or dijal kaa utpaadan mahangaa he or puure desh main ise lagu karne ke liye tel companiyon ko 50 hajaar se lekar 70 hajaar karod rupye kaa kharch karke apni rifinary ko aadhunik bananaa hoga
 Car prices will rise
 The impact of pressure on the pockets of the auto industry will mean that the prices of cars can increase

 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan also reached Baba Ramdev's Youth India Conference and he said that for the first time in the country, Baba Ramdev's Yoga books are being introduced in the syllabus
 iskaa makasad yoga ke saath-saath naitik shiksha dena he
 Significantly, the Muslim community and the Congress had opposed the rss's agenda as an agenda for yoga education
 baba ramdev ne kaha, 'aisa lagata he muskaraane kaa mauka aaye to muskaraayaa bhi karo hindustan ke pradhanmantri kii tarah gamagin mat rahaa karo
 It seems that poor poles are killed overnight
 subah se shaam tak sidhaa rahata he
 No one remains silent even after beating, as much as the Prime Minister remains silent
 hansane kaa mauka aaye to hansaa karo
 Anyone seen the Prime Minister laughing? That foreign lady is sitting so afraid

 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who has accused the Modi government of not working, has surrounded himself this time
 kejariwal par aarope hai ki unhone pradhanmantri kii ek kaushal yojana main adnga lagaaya he or ye adnga aisa he jisamen dilli main hajaaron yuvaaon ko berozegaar kar diya he
 In fact, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana i
e
 PMKVY started in July 2015 
 is yojana kaa makasad desh ke yuvaaon ko udyogon se judi training dena he, jisase unhen rojgaar paane main madad mil sake
 In this, the government pays the training fees itself
 PMKVY main 3 maheene, 6 maheene or 1 saal ke liye registration hota he
 After completing the course, a certificate is given which is valid across the country
 ye yojana yuvaaon ko naukari ke sunahare sapane dikhaata he, lekin yahaan sawaal sirf sunahare sapanom ke puraa hone kaa nahin he, balki in in sapanom ke puraa hone kaa he
 They are only and only with the help of the state government, in which Kejriwal's Delhi government seems completely unsuccessful
 298 centaron main se chal rahe hai sirf 15'ajtak' ke paas maujuud dastavej ke mutabik, centre sarkaar ne kaushal vikaas yojana ke liye dilli sarkaar ko 15 karod rupee die hai
 Now the central government is going to give two installments of 54 crores more to the Delhi government
 baavjood iske yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene ke liye shuru kii gai kaushal vikaas yojana dilli main dhul phank rahi he
 Due to this, out of 298 centers, only 15 centers are running now
 zyaadaatar logon ne yaa to is yojana se apane aapako kinare kar liya he yaa phir kaiyon ke centres par taala jal gaya he
 Center owners said, Vinod Rajaura, residing in Budh Vihar of Rohini, Delhi government not doing financial help, closed his center due to non-payment of rent for last 4 months
 yahi haal pitampura main rahane vaali shaalu manachanda kaa he
 Shalu Manchanda quit his administration job and spent his entire life in Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, but due to lack of money from the government, Shalu's center is throwing millions of rupees
 unhone bataaya ki dilli sarkaar ke paas centre sarkaar kii taraf se is yojana kaa puraa paisa aa chukaa he, lekin dilli sarkaar unke centaron ko chalaane ke liye paisa nahin de rahi he
 This is how the government helps the training center
 Actually, there is a need to open a training center for skill development scheme, in which the government provides financial help
 iske tahat kishton main centre kholane waalon ko paise die jate hai
 After showing the complete setup of the training center, the government gives 30 percent amount, while 20 to 30 percent is given after training the students, but the Delhi government has not given the money to the training centers which are open in Delhi
 aise main sawaal ye khadaa hota he ki kya kejariwal sarkaar ne jaanboojhkar centre sarkaar kii kaushal yojana ko latakaaya he
 BJP made this accusation on Kejriwal government, in this regard, if we wanted to contact the Delhi government, they did not react to it
 vahiin, dilli bijepi pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar nahin chaahati ki dilli ke andar sahi tareeke se modi sarkaar kii yojanaayen kaam karen
 This is the reason why the Delhi government has not yet implemented the central government health plan
 jabaki centre sarkaar kii swasthya yojana puure deshbhar main lagu ho chuki he
 However, Manoj Tiwari also said that he would soon meet the Skill Development Minister regarding this matter

 This is an application in which voice calls can be made through an internet connection and there is no need for a SIM for this
 sibbal ne kaha ki akaash kaa pradarshan 150 dollar ke tablet ke samaan he
 He said that this is a product that two-thirds of the world's population needs, because these people cannot buy a $ 150 tablet
 tippaniyan Regarding how the price of Aakash tablet will come down, Sibal said, the imported cost of touch screen is 22 or $ 20

 patidaar anamat andolan samiti ke sanyojak hardik patel kii museebataan or badhane ke asaar hai
 Recently he was arrested by Surat Police
 hajira police stesan main chali 8 ghante lambii poochtacha ke baad unhen court main pesh kiya gaya ar adaalat ne unhen shuukravaar tak ke liye police hiraasat main bhej diya
 The charges of rebellion against Hardik were allegedly due to his blatant statements of October 3 in which he encouraged the Patidars to kill the policemen instead of committing suicide
 lekin ab ek or masalaa saamne aayaa he
 3 more complaints have been filed against Hardik in Mehsana District
 bechraji or modhera main ek saarvajanik adhisuchana kaa ulanghan karne main unka haath bataaya ja rahaa he
 Not only this, the connections of the miscreants whom Visnagarpolis charged for a robbery are also being told with heartyness
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hoti he
 Hardik also has a hand in brutal violence and vandalism during Ekpatidar rally on 23 July
 visanagar police inspector em es waghela ke hisaab se hinsa ke dauraan updraviyon ne media waalon ke camere bhi chhinakar tod die
 Mehsana Police has said that they want Hardik's custody from Surat Police through a transfer warrant

 He has also appealed to the court for a transfer warrant for Custodian custody
 chhattisgarh police ko naksalwad se ladane kaa ek doosraa hathiyaar mil gaya he
 This weapon will neither shed blood nor create an atmosphere of fear
 is hathiyaar kaa idia darasal police ko naksaliyonki geet sangeet kii mandaliyon se mila he
 These mandalas have important yogdana in Naxalite movements
 inhen chetana natya manch yaa chetana mandali bhi kehete hai
 The work of these congregations is to make the illiterate and the mainstream of the tribal masses cut off by making songs in the Halbi, Chhattisgarhi and Gondi dialects to the tune of Khati indigenous instruments
 kul milakar in geeton kaa istemaal naksali adivasee janata tak apana sandesh pahunchane ke liye karte hai
 The thick squeeze of these songs is that the government treats the tribals with steps
 unki jal, jangal, jameen par sarkaar kabja kar rahi he
 The government is shown in these songs as a protector and a naxalite as a protector
 duusari taraf police or sena ke paas na to vahaan kii boli hoti he or na vahaan kii samskruti kii samaj
 In such a situation, this melodious weapon made of tone, rhythm and rhythm is very useful for the Naxalites
 lekin ab chhattisgarh police ne bhi is hathiyaar ko gadhana shuru kar diya he
 "an album of five songs is designed to counter the melodious yet sharp weapons of the Naxalites," says Nag Nag, Kondagaon Additional Superintendent of Chhattisgarh Garh district
 '' in gaanon kaa asar bhi saaf dikh rahaa he
 People have started taking interest in mingling with the police
 aage is tarah ke or bhi album taiyaar kiye jane kii yojana he
 In these songs, information is being given about government schemes, says ASP Nag
 ye bataaya ja rahaa he ki agar koi naksali aatmasamarpan karata he to sarkaar use kya-kya suvidhadeti he
 Simultaneously, an attempt is being made to tell through these songs how much Naxalites have done Bastar damage
 ek gane ke bol gunagunaate hue eespi naag kehete hai, jab sthaneey bhashaa main ye gaanaa gaaya jaataa he, jaag rahe hai sangi, jaag rahe hai mitan
 
 
 So the local people feel that their interest is being spoken to them
 kehane vaale unase alag nahin hai
 a different culture and dialect is the most important reason for the police and the army not to connect with the tribals
 jabik naksali inhen logon ke bich se aate hai
 Therefore, they are able to reach their point easily
 eespi naag kehete hai, '' pichley saal disambar main yah album ban gaya tha lekin isaki sidies gaanvon, skulon main teacheron, sarpanchon, anganbadiyon, aashaaon ko janvari se vitarit kerani shuru kii gayi
 These songs are being discussed a lot in Abujhmad, Kondagaon, Bijapur and Narayanpur
 paanch gaanon ke album main se teen gaanen eespi naag ne gaae hai
 These songs are in Halbi and Chhattisgarhi dialect
 eespi naag kehete hai, '' main chhattisgarh kaa hi hum isliye chhattisgadhi bhashaa to mujhe pehle se hi aati thi
 But i had to learn the Halbi language
 ''naag ne kaha is album ko bananaa isliye bhi chunauteepurn tha kyonki sthaneey logon main naksaliyon kaa bahut khauf he
 We wanted local music instruments players and songwriters
 lekin sthaneey log police ke saath meljol se bhi darate hai
 Naxalites kill the people of the village on the suspicion of whistleblowing
 baari mashkkat ke baad ham in logon ko raji kar paae
 But the condition of all this was that his name should not be revealed anywhere
 isliye album main kuch ke naam die bhi gaye hai to badalakar
 The posting of ASP Nagpal has been in different areas of Bastar for the last 11 years
 is album main koun-koun se vaadyayantra istemaal hue hai? maheshwar naag vistaar se bataate hai, ek khati desi vaadyantr hota he monhari, ye kuch-kuch shehanai kii tarah hota he
 It is made of bamboo pieces similar to the flute
 isamen chah chhed hote hai
 Its end is covered with a brass bowl
 ise tad ke pattey ke sahare bajaayaa jaataa he
 In addition, the album has an important role of Mandar
 ye dekhne main ek badi dholak jaisaa hota he
 This instrument made of red clay is about three times larger than a common drummer
 is badi dholak ke donon sire khule hote hai, jinhen bakre kii khaal se madha jaataa he
 Strong enchanting hands are needed to play it
 iske alaava dhol or bansuri bhi bajaai jaati he
 ASP Nag said that currently only one album of five songs has been prepared
 chhattisgadhi or halbi boli ke baad gondi bhashaa main bhi jald hi gaanon kaa anuwaad kiya jayega
 Apart from this, plans are also proposed to make street plays

 But in Raigad district of Chhattisgarh, a teacher cut the hair of seven high school girls
 peedit chaatraon kii shikaayat par police ne aaropee teacher ko giraftaar kar liya he
 This shameful case is of Bhupdevpur Thanan area of raigad
 jahaan naharpali shaskeey hai skool main pushpendra patel do saal se ganitshikshakke rup main tainaat he
 It is alleged that she stopped seven female students of ninth and tenth grade who reached the school late and asked them to come there to study or to make a tweet
 is baat par jab ladakiyon ne koi jawaab nahin diya to shikshak pushpendra patel ne apana aapa kho diya
 And she removed the scissors from the pocket and cut the hair of the girls one by one
 chaatraone skool se ghar jaakar ghatana kii jaankaree apane parijanon ko di
 The girl's family immediately informed the sarpanch and local officials about the case
 iske baad bhupadevpur thana pahuchakar parijanon ne shikshak ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kara diya
 The police came to know that the accused teacher is on contract
 lihaaja shiksha vibhaag ne bhi is maamle main koi hastkshep nahin kiya
 After the case was registered, the police arrested the accused
 rawalpindi or srinagar ke bich kauwon ne to bahut pehle hi udaan bharna band kar diya tha
 The Kashmir highway, which once connected these two ancient cities on the Inner Asia trade route, has now been used less

 Then why should the crowds of social gathering come and go

 One such VVIP Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar boarded a special aircraft from Palam to Chaklala (military airports of Delhi and Rawalpindi) on 3 March
 unka ek hi mishan tha‚Äîbharat or pakistan ke bich rukii hui baatcheet ko dobaaraa shuru karnaa
 The important thing is that Jaishankar was traveling to Islamabad when it was just 48 hours to form a coalition government of BJP and PDP (people's Democratic Party) in Jammu and Kashmir headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 in donon partiyon ke bemisaal gathbandhan ke bare main bahut kuch likhaa ja chukaa he ki kaise modi ne jansangh ke netaa shyama prasad mukherjee ke 1953 ke naare 'ek vidhaan, ek pradhan, ek nishaan' ko badal diya he, jo kabhi samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ko radd karne kii vakaalat karata tha
 On the other hand, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir not only managed to uphold the status of the special state given in the Constitution, but he insisted on including two things in the 'coalition agenda' agreed with the consent of the two parties
 ek, 'centre kii ore se pakistan ke saath rishte saamaanya karne ke liye haal main uthaae gaye kadam' or doosraa, 'meljol kaa maahaul banane ke liye sarkaar ke uthaae gaye kadamon kaa samarthan karnaa or unhen majboot bananaa
 Sources in the PDP suggest that they want to create the same magic again that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had done during several visits to Kashmir more than a decade ago
 2002 kii garmiyon main centre or kashmir ke bich bhavishya kii baatcheet ke swaroop ke bare main ek reporter ke poochne par vaajapeyi ne kaha tha, ''ve inasaaniyat ke daayre main hongi

 ''pakistan ke bheetar maahaul kuch zyada hi gamgin he
 The focus of the power establishment and the political opposition has been on resuming dialogue with India through Foreign Secretary level talks between Jaishankar and Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary
 jammu-kashmir main satta sanbhaalane vaali pidipi-bijepi ke anokhe gathbandhan par philhal unka dhyaan nahin he
 In an exclusive conversation with this reporter on the eve of foreign secretary-level talks, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that he was "eager to re-join the broken thread of 1999 (when Musharraf waged a war in Kargil) and Awaiting meaningful dialogue between the two sides
 '' unhone kaha ki unhen ummid he ki videsh sachiv stareey baatcheet rishton ko saamaanya banane kii ore le jaaegi or isaki shuruyaat niyantran rekha par 2003 ke yudhviram samjhaute kii bahaali se hogi
 In August 2014, Sharif refused to say anything about the cancellation of India's dialogue and the subsequent political upheaval within Pakistan, but several political leaders from various parties confirmed that India had when Foreign Secretary level When Sharif's conversation was called off, Sharif "felt very bad that Narendra Modi had let him down"
 in netaaon ke mutabik may, 2014 main jab sharif ne fouj kii anaupchaarik salaah ko andekha karke modi ke shapath grahan kaa nyauta kubul kiya or nai dilli gaye, tab unhone alag-thalag padane kaa jokhim uthaaya tha
 The leader of Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League (nawaz), says, "the Pakistani Prime Minister believes that peace with India is the only option, but when the talks are canceled, his hopes turn into despair
" ''13 farvari ko modi ne sharif ko phone kiya, lekin tab tak kaman pakistani sena pramukh raahil sharif ke haathon main jaati dikhaai di
 After the attacks on the school in Peshawar, Sharif once again tried to take command, but then the Pakistan Army Chief flew to Kabul and met the Afghan President there and asked him to apprehend the attackers
 hafton baad jab skool dobaaraa khulaa, tab navaj sharif nahin, balki raahil sharif ne pehle din skool main bacchon kaa istakabal kiya
 But political experts also say that it would be a mistake to believe that the current balance of power will always be in favor of the Pakistani Army
 ek jaankaar ne kaha, ''yaad rakhie ki 1999 main musharraf ne kaise navaj sharif ko aam mujrim kii tarah atak jail main daal diya tha
 Nevertheless, Nawaz waited for his time and finally returned as the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 ''udhar chunki pakistani kabje vaala kashmir islamabad-rawalpindi kii sarkaar ke sidhe niyantran main he, lihaaja donon kashmiri hisson ke bich rishte sudhaarney kaa sara daaromadar said ke kandhon par aa jayega
 But the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister will rely on Delhi to allow more scope on the Line of Control

 In Islamabad, the perception is strong that the negotiations have been initiated under international pressure (under pressure from the US)
 pakistani media aisi khabaron se bharaa padaa he ki america raashtrapati baraak obama ne sharif ko phone kiya or bataaya ki hindustani pradhanmantri jald hi unhen phone karenge
 Coincidentally or whatever, Modi called on 13 February and wished Nawaz Sharif for his cricket team participating in the World Cup in Australia
 jawaab main sharif ne bhi aisa hi kiya
 Recalling his conversation with Modi last May, Sharif told this reporter, "when i came to Delhi, i told him that i had come to start a new chapter in our relationship
" aapke paas bhi jabardast janadesh he or mere paas bhi
 "he further said," The Indian Prime Minister told me that let's move forward on the path of work and i too responded positively
 mujhe khushi hui, jab unhone bheeshan peshawar hamale ke baad mujhe phone kiya, hamaara dard baanta or phir pakistani cricket team ke liye shubhakamana jaahir kii

 The BJP government of the state has decided that now the sage-mahatma will also be able to give his discourse in the government schools of Rajasthan
 rajasthansarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag ne calendar jari kiya he jisamen shanivaar ke antim period main kisi bhi kshetra se aane vaale logon ko bulaakar skool main bacchon ko mahapurushon kii jivaniyaan yaa preranadayak kahaniyaan sunaane ko kaha jayega
 At the same time, it has also been decided in the calendar that in this program, the school committee can also call the saint-mahatma and give him a lecture
 rajasthande shiksha mantri vasudev devnani vaise to hameshaa se vivaadon main rahe hai, lekin ab bacchon ko sanskari banane ke liye unhone nayaa tarika apanaaya he
 All government schools in Rajasthan will have a 'sanskar Period' from July 1 to Saturday, wherein people of unique identity from different fields will come to class and tell inspiring stories of great men
 isi dauraan bacchon ke dada-daadi or naanaa-nani ko bhi bulaane kaa praavdhaan he jo class main aakar dada-daadi or naanaa-nani kii kahaniyaan sunaayenge
 Apart from these, the school committee has also been given the freedom to call saints and saints to hear the discourse of cremating children
 shiksha mantri vasudev devnani bataaya ki hamane ek skool cameti banaai he jo har skool ke liye alag-alag hogi wo tay karegi ki kisko bulaanaa he

 The Opposition alleges that the Education Minister has been working on the saffron agenda since the beginning, in such a situation he is trying to saffronise education under the guise of such sacrament period

 The picture of Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has been questioned by BJP MP Satish Gautam
 gautam ne eemyu ke visi ko chitthee likhakar iskaa kaaran saaf karne ke liye kaha he ki vahaan ye tasviir kyon lagi hui he
 This picture of Jinnah is in the hall of the Students Union in AMU
 saansad gautam ne apni chitthee main sawaal kiya he ki jinna kii tasviir eemyu main lagaae rakhane kii koun si majaburi bani hui he
 Everyone knows that Jinnah was the main architect of the partition of the country
 bijepi saansad ne yah bhi likhaa he ki unhen nahin pataa ki ye tasviir uniwarsity ke kis vibhaag main or kin kaarnon se lagaai gai he
 He has further written that at present even non-essential activities are going on from Pakistan, in such a situation, how logical it is to put pictures of Jinnah in AMU
 chaatr sangh kaa javabeemaunaatr sangh ke adhyaksh mashkur ahamed osmani kaa kahana he ki jinna kii tasviir chaatr sangh ke central haul main lagi he, isliye saansad ko visi kii jagah chaatr sangh se sawaal karnaa chahie tha
 Usmani said, 'AMU Students' Union was established in 1905
 ye ek swatantra sanstha he
 When India was undivided in 1938, Jinnah was awarded honorary life membership by the AMU students' union
 sabase pehle ye sadsyta mahatma gandhi ko di gai thi
 Similarly, Jawaharlal Nehru, CV Raman, Rabindra Nath Tagore, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad and Dr
 BR Ambedkar were also given this membership
 sabhi kii tasviren central haul main lagi hai
 At that time these memberships were given to those who contributed to society and country
 ' osmani ne ye aarope bhi lagaaya ki jo log essi / asti act ko halkaa karnaa chaahate hai vahiin itihaas ko bhi palatnaa chaahate hai
 Mohammad Nadeem, a cabinet member of AMU Students Union, says that Jinnah's picture has been in place since 1938, before the country got independence
 nadeem ne yah bhi kaha ki saansad ye koi bataaenge ki kiski tasviir lagaani he or kiski hataani he
 Although the AMU administration is yet to receive the letter of the MP, he came to know about it through the media
 iske baad eemyu prashasan chitthee kaa sangyaan le rahaa he
 According to amu's PRO Shafee Kidwai, the university's students' union is an independent institution
 isane 1920 main aaajeevan sadsyta die jane kii shuruuaat kii thi
 Photographs are placed in the hall of Students Union in this order - AMU founder Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Mahatma Gandhi, Jinnah, Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders
 bisisiai ke antarim pramukh jagmohan daalamia ne kaha ki cricket dakshin africa ke nae siio haaron lorgat agar donon bordon ke bich matbhed sulajhane ke liye maafee maangate hai to acha hoga
 During Lorgat's tenure as ICC chief executive, there was a clash between the BCCI and several issues, and after Lorgat took over as the CSA, the Indian board is unlikely to send his team on a full tour of South Africa
 tippaniyan Responding to media reports in this regard, Lorgat has no problem apologizing for resolving differences with the BCCI, Dalmiya said, "lorgat is a good man, but he will be good if he apologizes
" daalamia ne haalanki kaha ki is saal bharat ke dakshin africa daure ko lekar koi atkal nahin lagaai jaani chahie jaisaa ki board adhyaksh en shrinivasana ne 1 sitambar ko yahaan kaary samiti kii baithak ke baad kaha tha

 If you are connected to social sites, now be careful
 mumbai kii shaheen dhada or renu shrinivasana ke liye 18 november kii shaam yahi sabak lekar ai
 After the demise of Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray, there was an update by Shaheen on his Facebook profile in Mumbai: "people like Thackeray are born and die every day
" is vajah se mumbai band karne kii kya zarurat he?‚Äùyah yuvavastha kii dahalij par khadi 21 varshiya shaheen kii bhaavana kaa mahaj izhaar bhar tha, jise uski ek dost renu ne ‚Äòlike‚Äô kar diya
 What was just, the officials of Palghar police station in Thane were quick and arrested both the women under Section 66 (A) of Information Technology (IT) Act, late evening accusing them of hurting religious sentiments on the internet
 is giraftaar ne thakare ko lekar juty media kaa dhyaan khinchaa or desh hi nahin, duniya main bhi abhivyakti kii aazaadee par bahes chhid gai
 The immediate effect of this debate was that late night the police released Shaheen and Renu on bail
 lekin dilachasp pahalu yah he ki police ne yuvatiyon kii giraftaar suryaast ke baad kii or raat ke dhai baje tak thane main bithaae rakhaa, jabaki supreme court ke disha nirdeshon ke mutabik kisi mahila kii giraftaar suraj dhalane ke baad nahin kii ja sakati
 The Mumbai police did not show as much agility in arresting the two girls who expressed their feelings as those of the Shiv Sainiks who broke into Shaheen's house and her uncle's hospital
 india today se baatcheet main alpsankhyak maamalon ke kendriya mantri ke
 Rehman Khan says, "the arrest of two girls in the case of social sites in Mumbai, i believe that the law has been misused in it
" ‚Äùis maamle ne shaheen-renu or uske parivaar ko jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 Shaheen has closed her Facebook account, Renu has opted out of both Facebook and Twitter
 renu kaa dard uske is bayaan se bhi jaahir hota he, ‚Äò‚Äòmere mata-pita ko is ghatana se kaaphi pareshaani jhelni padi he
 My father sat in the police station till two and a half hours
 agle hafte naukari ke liye meraa intervyuu he
 But now i am not sure that i will get a job
 is ghatana ke chalate meraa bhavishya chapat ho gaya he
 On the other hand, Khafzada Shaheen publicly apologized for his Facebook update
 ve safai or detii hai, ‚Äò‚Äòkisi kii bhaavana ko aahat karnaa meraa makasad nahin tha
 Now before making any update i will think twice
 ‚Äùaaj ke yuva apana dher sara samay soshal cites par bitaane lage hai
 But today, the way the IT Act is trying to screw up social sites or show fear of law, freedom of expression seems to be guarded
 shaheen-renu maamle se pehle bhi kanoon kaa galat istemaal ho chukaa he
 Union Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ke bete karti chindbaram par ek twit ke liye puducheri police ne 45 varshiya ravi naam ke ek vyavsaayee ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Ambikesh Mahapatra, a professor at Jadavpur University in West Bengal, was arrested just because he made a cartoon of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 jaipur ke dalit activist or patrkaar satyendra murali ke khilaaf jaipur police ne gandhi kaa cartoon share karne par cese thope diya
 However, in the case of misuse of IT Act, this is the second major case after Karti Chindabaram, which came into the limelight
 nishchit taur par do din kii maansik yatnaa ne shaheen-renu ke man par gahari chot kii he or abhi bhi ve usase ubar nahin pai hai
 But once again, the question arises whether anyone has the right to express their feelings or thoughts among their friends? Justice Markandey Katju, former Supreme Court judge and President of Press Council of India, arrested the two girls
 The very next day sent an e-mail to Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, "we live in a democratic system, a fascist dictatorship system Not received
 yah giraftaar apane aap main aparaadh he or doshi police afasaron ko giraftaar kar unhen sajaa di jaani chahie
 "now both girls will have to go through the legal process
 lekin is masale par chhidi bahes ke bich sibar kanoon ke visheshgy pawan duggal ity act kii dhara 66 e ko kaala dhabba qaraar dete hai
 In his words, "while drafting this law, it was broadly interpreted and the privilege of defining it was left to the police
" ‚Äù ve kehete hai ki yah kanoon khud main apana hi majaak udaane vaala he
 With everything in the hands of the police, his own ideology can dominate the interpretation of that law
 maharashtra se saansad or sanchaar rajyamantri milind devda bhi mumbai police kii is karrwai par aitraaj jataa chuke hai
 But in this whole matter, the congress-ncp government of Maharashtra is stuck at the crossroads itself
 apni hi police kii kirakiri par bachaav kii mudra main aae maharashtra ke grih mantri aar
 R
 patil is kanoon kii vyakhya ko bakhede kii vajah maanate hai
 "there is no clear definition of IT law," he says
 sab isaki vyakhya apane tareeke se karte hai or isi doharepan kii sthiti ne bhram paidaa kiya or ladakiyon kii giraftaar hui
 "but Deora does not agree with the amendment to the law
 unki raay main, ‚Äò‚Äòsawaal ity kanoon kii dhara 66 e ke sanshodhan kaa nahin balki iske galat istemaal kaa he
 In this case, the police hurriedly used the wrong legal sections
 ‚Äùkendriya doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne bhi shaheen maamle main mumbai police kii teji ko galat tehraaya
 But in such cases, the law should not be questioned again and it should not be misused, for this, they have called a meeting in the ministry on 29 November
 ab bhale sarkaar kanoon ke bachaav main koi bhi daleel de, lekin 2008 main jab upie sarkaar ne is kanoon main sanshodhan kiya tha to sansad ke bheetar koi bahes nahin hui thi or sarvasammati se sibar lau ke fremawork main badlaav ho gaya tha
 Now four years later, its impact can be felt clearly
 sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki shaheen par karrwai kya uske muslim hone kii vajah se kii gai? post main dharmik bhaavana bhadakaane vaali kya baat thi? yahaan bataa den ki web kii saamagree hataane ke liye bharat se google ko is saal july se ab tak jitne request mili hai, unamem se dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane vaale maamle sirf paanch fisadi hai
 The 18 per cent request has been for the removal of material related to the government's condemnation
 content hataane ke sabase zyada maamle niztaa or surahna sambandhi hai
 No request for criticism of the government has come due to a court order
 thakare ko lekar fasebuk par tamaam aisi tippaniyan us vakt bhi kii ja rahi thim, jab shaheen ne apni post fasebuk par daali thi
 It is obvious that the police was very bad in the case of social sites, so it is possible that the government should take corrective steps now
 is hafte jab logon kii nazren kathmandu or vahaan modi-sharif ke bich anaupchaarik bhent par jami hai, videsh niti kii ek aitihaasik ghatana kuch had tak khamoshi ke saath hamaare najadik se guzar gai
 If not visible frills and theatricality, then fine-grained and esoteric meanings are perhaps only meant for the bookworms of policy and the elders of strategic studies
 isse bhi zyada mjedaar yah ki ise kootnithik masterstroke se lekar modi ke sarv-vijeta vaishvik sammohan kaa ek or udhaaharan, chhavi-nirmaan kaa ek shandaar mauka or bhi na jane kya-kya kaha gaya
 But the most important thing was not said - this is the fourth major change in India's foreign policy in 22 years, and that too without changing the direction
 obama ganatantr diwas parade kii shobhaa badhayenge, to yah pehla mauka hoga jab ek america ko yah sammaan diya jayega
 Throughout our history, America had been such a far-reaching force to which we had raised our hands only on occasions of extreme need
 1962 kii viraat paraajay ke dauraan badi taadaad main america hathiyaar or prashikshan maanga gaya or mila
 During Nehru's last years, Americans set up military missions in New Delhi and that too under the leadership of a supreme two-star general
 lekin yah sab radar se ojhal rakhaa gaya
 We were not calling each other strategic allies
 1965 kii ladaai ke baad rishton main giravat ai, lekin ek ke baad ek lagaataar sookhe kii maar jhelane ke baad piel-480 (anaaj kii madad) ke saath hamaare rishte phir dostana hue
 If we got American weapons and training in the 1960s, then in 1965, wheat-laden American ships arrived at our ports
 uske baad 1971 main rishte ek baar phir thande pad gaye
 At that time, it was impossible for any government to survive by calling the US President as the chief guest at the Republic Day parade
 un dashakon main yah behad jokhim se bharaa tha, jab america-virodh gut-nirpeksh andolan kaa or iske jariye hamaari videshi niti kaa mul mantra tha
 That is why that honor was reserved for "non-aligned" heads of state, many Third World dictators, and the anti-american Cold War troupe in general
 1950 se 1990 ke chaar dashak main keval teen america raashtrapati bharat aae
 These include a day trip by Richard Nixon in 1969, which was more like a brief stopover
 2000 main bill clinton ke aane ke baad hi unke donon uttaradhikariyon ne apni bharat yatra ko sajaakar pesh karnaa gavaara kiya, or obama apane raashtrapati kaal ke dauraan duusari baar nai dilli kii yatra karenge
 It is not just that no American was given this honor during this year
 soviet or anya purvi kheme / gut-nirpeksh deshon ke kaddavar netaaon kii niyamit upasthiti rahaa karti thi
 Some leaders of the former Yugoslavia, like Marshal Tito, visited more than once (1968, 1974)
 phir us jamaane ke pasandida ‚Äò‚Äòafro-asian‚Äô‚Äô rashtron ke netaa the-tanzania ke julius narere, jair ke mobutu, 1958 main chini (marshall ye jianying), yahaan tak ki do pakistani bhi, 1955 main malik gulam mohammad or sabase ascharyajanak, 1965 main rana abdul hamid
 In the following months of the same year we fought a fierce battle, which lasted 22 days
 jis china or pakistan ke saath ham jameen ko lekar ladaaiyon main mubtila the, unke netaaon kaa swaagat karne ke liye to ham taiyaar the lekin america or zyaadaatar anya pashchimi deshon ke netaaon ke liye hamaare daravaaje khule nahin the, jinase hamaare jhagade vichaardhaara ko lekar the
 Looking at history, the only Western leader to be invited was Queen Elizabeth II, and that too in 1961 when Nehru's reign nostalgia was established
 ek british pradhanmantri ko bhi 1993 (jon major) tak intjaar karnaa padaa
 It is interesting that even after taking a cursory glance at the list of the chief guests during all these decades, it is clear that Indian foreign policy is completely submerged in the anti-western hangover
 ham udaar, sanvaidhanik ganatantr ke vichaar kii sambhawatah khilli udaane vaale taanaashaahon or nirankush shaskaon kii mehmaannawaaji karke khush the
 You'd be surprised how Fidel Castro and Nasser missed out
 jo pashchimi netaa kabhi-kabhaar aae bhi, ve haashie ke desh, misaal ke liye, spain or greece ke the
 You will also notice that France was separate from this stream
 vah is pavitra manch par chaar baar upasthit hua, main itane saal tak pashchim se bhayakrant satta pratishthan ke is france-prem ko puri tarah samaj paane main asamarth hum
 i can only guess that despite being a NATO ally, France was considered a critic of America and of course culturally superior
 yaa phir sambhawatah paanchaven dashak se hi vah hamen hathiyaar dene vaala ekmaatr pashchimi desh tha
 And i think that Indira Gandhi's learning of French did not harm anyone
 lekin francisi bhi pehali baar 1976 main hi bulaae gaye
 It would be interesting to recall that this was the peak period of Emergency and Indira Gandhi would have understood the importance of mobilizing the support of a "western" Republic
 nehru ne 1950 main pehle hi ganatantr diwas par indonesia ke sukarno ko mukhya atithi banaakar maahaul kaayam kar diya tha or takreeban teen dashakon tak kisi ne bhi unki patakatha main herpher karne kii jurrat nahin kii
 We also called Norodam Sinhanuk (1963) of Cambodia and Nguyen Van Linh (1989) of Vietnam
 saal-dar-saal sammanit karne ke liye jis tareeke se apane videshi doston ko chunaa, usase hamaare vaishvik nazariye ke viksit hone, yaa shaayad jadvat rahane, kii avishwasaneey rup se sateek jhalak milti he
 Only after the beginning of the reforms or the end of the Cold War, separate names are added to the list, though they are too helpless
 jaisaa ki hamane upar bataaya tha, francisi chaaron baar 1976 ke baad hi aae
 Britain, South Korea, Japan, even Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev were called
 lekin america? ab yahi wo badlaav he
 This is such a significant change that we can call it the fourth biggest change in our policy framework since the introduction of reforms in 1991
 pehla bada badlaav vah tha, jab pi
 V
 narsingh raav ne janvari 1992 main israel ke saath purna kootnithik rishte sthapit kiye the
 It was a very, very courageous and risky decision for a Congress Prime Minister, especially when leading a non-gandhi minority government
 lekin un shaatir maharathi ne jis tarah apana bachaav kiya, vaisaa keval vahi kar sakate the
 He announced his decision when Yasir Arafat was in New Delhi and persuaded him to stamp the verdict in his press conference
 asal main yah badlaav israel ko lekar utana nahin tha, jitna philstin ko lekar tha, jo rangabhed-virodh, samrajyavad-virodh or bahultawad ke saath hamaari saaf taur par pashchim-virdohi gut-nirpekshata kaa stambh rahaa tha
 That is why i call it the first strategic change
 doosraa badlaav apana kaarykaal puraa karne vaale agle pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main aayaa
 He became the first Indian leader to greet America not only as a strategic, but also as a "natural" ally
 isi se nae mail-milaap kii or america raashtrapatiyon kii twarit yatraaon kii halchal shuru hui
 One important aspect is that even in the more modern system of Rajiv Gandhi, the American President did not come to India
 apane kaarykaal ke duusare hisse tak aate-aate vah ‚Äò‚Äònani yaad dilaa denge‚Äô‚Äô kism ke bhaashan de rahe the
 Even with Vajpayee himself, the generational gap was difficult because both Clinton and Bush were much younger in age than him
 lekin unhen jaswant singh, brajesh mishra or yashavanth sinha kaa sahyog bakhubi hasil tha, jo na keval is nirantar badlaav main bharosa karte the, balki iske shilpkaar bhi the
 This helped prevent fighting in the subcontinent twice, in 1999 (kargil) and 2002 (after the attack on Parliament)
 teesraa badlaav ek baar phir congressi pradhanmantri ke netritv main aayaa, jo bejhijak vam-madhyamargi gathbandhan kii aguai kar rahaa tha
 When Manmohan Singh put his government at stake in the nuclear deal, he was taking another decisive step in the direction decided by his political guru Rao and then Vajpayee
 haalanki ise lekar khud unki hi party main sonia gandhi se lekar arjuna singh or salmaan khurshid tak ke gambhir andeh ke swar uth rahe the
 But he refused to lose the left allies and led the agreement to concrete results
 maine hameshaa kaha he ki parmaanu qaraar urja ke bare main nahin tha
 It was definitely a more polished cover
 anivaary rup se yah duniya ko dekhne or usase judye ke bharat ke tareeke main ranneetik badlaav tha
 This was accepted by Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, the most vocal opponent of the agreement
 unhone mujhase kaha tha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain aapaki soch se chaahe jitna asahmat hum, nafrat karun, magar kam se kam aap akele hai, jo bauddhik eemaandaaree ke saath kehete to hai ki yah qaraar urja ke bare main nahin, balki videsh niti main buniyadi badlaav ke bare main he
 Modi's invitation to Obama is the fourth change

 The Yeddyurappa camp's choice for chief ministerial post in Karnataka has led the party to postpone the issue of leadership selection in the state till August 3, after the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), named after Udupi MP Sadanand Gowda
 karnataka maamalon ke prabharee dharmendra pradhan ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòbhaajapa vidhayak dal ke netaa kaa chunaav teen agast ko gyaarah baje kiya jayega
 The outgoing Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, who had cleared his resignation to Governor Hansraj Bhardwaj for three days, focussed on the Vokkaliga leader Gowda as his successor
 isse pehle unhone teen naamon kaa panel diya tha, jisamen gauda ke alaava ucch shiksha mantri vies acharya, kanoon evam nyaay mantri suresh kumaar es shaamil the
 However the central leadership did not agree on Gowda's candidacy for the post
 bhaajapa mahasachiv or saansad anant kumaar or unke samarthak gauda ke agle mukhyamantri banane kaa baari virodh kar rahe he
 According to unconfirmed reports, the central leadership is busy in agreeing to make Kumar the next chief minister
 brahman netaa kumaar yediurppa ke virdohi maane jate hai or bataaya jaataa he ki ateet main yediurppa ke khilaaf jo bhi asantosh hua uske peeche kumaar hi haath rahaa he
 Kumar has the support of the mining barons Reddy brothers and this could be one of the reasons for the central leadership's support towards him
 reddy bandhu loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ke kareeb maane jate hai or swaraj kaa kumaar ke saath bhi acchhee patari baithti he
 Earlier, central observers Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh discussed the Yeddyurappa camp in Bangalore and the rival camp led by state president KS Eshwarappa for more than four hours and then left for Delhi
 jahaan yediurppa sadananda gauda ke naam par dabaav bana rahe hai, vahiin pratidwandvi gut unka virodh kar rahaa he 
 Apart from Eshwarappa in the rival camp, the party's national general secretary HN Anantkumar and ministers duo Jagdish Shettar and r Ashoka
 bataaya jaataa he ki yediurppa virdohi kheme ne prarambh main mukhyamantri pad ke liye shettar yaa kumaar kaa naam aage badhaayaa, lekin yah pehle kheme ko pansad nahin aayaa
 The Eshwarappa camp then demanded Shettar to be the Deputy Chief Minister
 yediurppa kheme ko yah maang raas nahin aayi
 Sources said that both camps are adamant on their demands and there is no consensus
 uske baad yah nirnay liya gaya he ki yah mudda kendriya netritv ke paas le jaaya jaae
 Senior leader m Venkaiah Naidu, who is in talks with BJP leaders in Karnataka to resolve the leadership crisis, is also considered close to Kumar
 yadi sahmati banati he to kumaar yediurppa ke uttaradhikari ban sakate hai
 Kumar is also close to senior party leader LK Advani
 yadi kumaar yaa unke koi kareebi mukhyamantri banate hai, to yediurppa khemaa chaiyn se nahin baithegaa or party kii karnataka ikai main asantosh aam ho jayega
 Yeddyurappa has claimed support of 75 of the 121 BJP mlas in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly

 Pakistan's popular leader and Pakistani Awami Tehreek (PAT) party founder Maulvi tahir-ul-qadri has announced his retirement from politics
 unhone sanyas kii kuch khaas vajah nahin bataai
 However, he said he wanted to focus on academic work
 kadri ne soshal media par apane ek video sandesh main kaha ki main pieti ke adhyaksh pad or raajnneeti se sevanivritti le rahaa hum
 Qadri has also resigned as the president of Pakistan Awami Tehreek Party
 samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik kadri ne kaha ki main apane beton ko party kaa netritv nahin saunp rahaa hum, lekin party kii parishad ko satta saunp rahaa hum
 Qadri said that the legal battle to kill 14 of our activists will continue till my last breath
 yah raajnneeti kaa maamla nahin he balki yah vishwaas kaa vishay he
 Explain that the house and offices of Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) chief Tahirul Qadri were raided by the police in 2014, when fourteen people, including two women, were killed
 kadri ne 2014 main pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke pramukh imran khan ke saath tatkaaleen pradhan mantri or pakistan muslim lig (en) pramukh navaj sharif ke khilaaf islamabad main sarkaar virdohi pradarshan kiya tha
 According to party sources, Qadri has apparently left politics because the future of politics in the country is not visible due to the current Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf party government

 If you want to improve sex life and married life, then put some responsibility of taking care of the children on the shoulders of the husband
 haal hi main hue ek research ke mutabik, jo pita apane bacchon ke saath jude hote hai, unka vaivaahik jivan aisa na karne waalon kitulana main sukhad hota he
 Research has found that if a man supports his wife in the care of children, then their mutual coordination improves

 His teaser has clearly shown the tone of the film, and it gives a glimpse of the cool story of a fan
 uske saath hi kairactor ko dilli aadhaarit bhi banaaya gaya he
 The opening dialogue of the teaser is also fun: 'connection is not too amazing, it's done, it's done'
 filmamen aryan khanna (shahrukh khan) ke fain bane gaurav (yanishahrukh khan) ko dilli kaa ladkaa dikhaaya gaya he, jo apane superstar kaa divaana he
 If you come to Delhi, the mention of Connaught Place and single screen theater like Novelty, Golcha and Delight makes the story more fun and real
 phir marks kam aana, apane hero ke liye jhagadna or dilli kii sadakon par masti bhi tiger se conect karne kaa kaam karte hai
 One reason for this is that Gaurav belongs to Delhi, apart from this, the director of the film Manish Sharma also has a Delhi connection
 mjedaar yah ki manish sharma dilli ke hansraj college se passout hai toshahrukh khanbhi isi college ke student rah chuke hai
 In this way, the language of Delhi, the culture of Delhi and the style of Delhi bring Shah Rukh closer to his fans
 film agle saal 15 april ko relies ho rahi he
 Anyway, Shah Rukh, who has always done romantic style films, is coming up with a different style this time, in which he is crazy about a superstar
 tabhi to kaha gaya he, duniya kaa sabase bade superstar kaa sabase bada fain
 Anyway, it is his birthday today, and his decision to release this day is absolutely correct too

 haalanki, court ne rajya ke mukhya sachiv or grih sachiv ko is maamle main 13 agast ko upasthit hokar bataane kaa nirdesh diya he ki aakhir in rikt padon ko bharne main kam se kam kitna samay lagegaa
 In fact, the matter was going on in the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court while hearing a Public Interest Litigation had directed all the state governments to fill the vacant posts of their police department in a phased manner
 yah aadesh april 2017 main paarit kiya gaya tha or 2020 main agast tak sabhi rikt padon par niyuktiyaan kii jaani thi
 In this order, the High Court of every state was also ordered to monitor the matter
 is aadesh ke baad sarvocch nyaayalay main bihar sarkaar ne aashwaasan diya tha ki wo saare khaali pad 2020 tak bhar legi
 But now the state government says that it will take three more years
 is par court kaa kahana tha ki aam nagarikon kii jaan maal kii suraksha kisi bhi rajya sarkaar kii pehali praathamikta honi chahie
 But it seems that the government does not care about public safety
 isse pehle ucch nyaayalay ne patna sahit anya shaharon main gandagi or atikaraman par bhi rajya sarkaar ko jamkar fatkaar lagaayi thi or disha nirdesh jari kiye the
 The High Court is now monitoring this case as well
 congress netaa jagdambika paal ne loksabhaa sadsyta se istipha dete hue party chhodane kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Jagdambika Pal said that Congress does not need me anymore and has not taken any decision regarding the future
 unhone kaha ki logon se baat kar apane agle kadam ke bare main faisla karuunga
 Significantly, Jagdambika Pal was angry with the top leadership of the party
 unka maananaa he ki party ne unka istemaal kiya, lekin badale main unhen kuch nahin mila
 Six ministers from Pal, whether it be Beni Prasad Verma, Salman Khurshid or Sriprakash Jaiswal have become ministers at the center, but they were ignored, which he considers an insult

 With the Indian team not reaching the finals of the ongoing tri-series in Australia and its first match in the Asia Cup on 13 March, it has now been decided that even after a full year has passed, Sachin Tendulkar's name in international matches i will not score a century and this will be the first time in this star batsman's career
 tendulkar ne apana aakhri shatak vishwa cap 2011 main 12 march ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf nagpur main lagaaya tha or iske baad vah test or vanade main kul milakar 32 paariyaan khel chuke hai lekin inamen tihare ank tak nahin pahunch paye
 In the meantime, he scored eight half-centuries, two of which reached beyond 90 runs
 bangladesh main hone vaale asia cap main bhartiya team 13 march ko srilanka se apana pehla match khelegi or tab tak tendulkar antarrashtriya cricket main bina shatak lagaaye 366 din puraa kar lenge
 This is the first time Sachin will miss a century for 365 or more days
 master blaster bich main ek baar 34 antarrashtriya pariyon tak shatak nahin laga paye the lekin tab samay itnaa lanbaa nahin khinchaa tha
 Tendulkar played 34 innings in international cricket between 26 May 2007 and 4 January 2008 in which he could not reach triple digits
 unhone tab haalanki 223 din ke andar ye paariyaan khel lee thi
 He then became a victim of nervous niggles on several occasions and was dismissed for 99 runs three times
 tippaniyan After this, in 1992, no international century was registered in his name for 299 days but in the meantime the batting king played only 11 innings
 tendulkar ne vartmaan daur se pehle apane antarrashtriya shatak ke liye sabase lanbaa samay 1995-96 main liya tha
 He could not score a century for 315 days then, but in the meantime India played very little cricket
 iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sachin ne is dauraan keval das antarrashtriya paariyaan kheli thi
 After this, there was a similar period in 2004 when Tendulkar had to wait for 257 days for a century
 mana ja rahaa he ki tendulkar ko mahashatak kaa intjaar samaapt karne ke liye hi asia cap kii team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In this continental tournament, India will play their first match against Sri Lanka after playing the next match against Bangladesh on March 16 and then will face their arch rival Pakistan on March 18
 tendulkar yadi isamen shatak nahin laga pate hai to unka intjaar bahut lanbaa khinch jayega kyonki iske baad bharat july main hi antarrashtriya match khelegaa
 The Indian team will then travel to Sri Lanka to play three Tests

 The Indian team will then travel to Sri Lanka to play three Tests
 tendulkar ne 26 may 2007 se chaar janvari 2008 ke bich antarrashtriya cricket main 34 aisi paariyaan kheli thi jinamein vah tihare ank main nahin pahunch paye the
 He had then played these innings within 223 days
 vah tab kai avasaron par nervas ninties ke shikaar bane or teen baar to 99 ran par out hue the
 The comments iske baad 1992 main bhi 299 din tak unke naam par koi antarrashtriya shatak darj nahin ho paaya tha lekin is bich ballebaaji ke badshaah ne keval 11 paariyaan hi kheli thi
 Tendulkar took the longest time for his international century in 1995‚Äì96 before the current round
 vah tab 315 din tak shatak nahin laga paye the lekin is bich bharat ne bahut kam cricket kheli thi
 This can be gauged from the fact that Sachin played only ten international innings during this period
 iske baad 2004 main bhi aisa daur aayaa tha jabaki tendulkar ko shatak ke liye 257 din tak kaa intjaar karnaa padaa tha
 It is believed that Tendulkar has been included in the Asia Cup squad only to end his wait for a century
 is mahadwipiya toornament main bharat pehla match srilanka se khilne ke baad aglaa match 16 march ko bangladesh se khelegaa or phir 18 march ko apane chir pratidwandvi pakistan se bhidega
 If Tendulkar does not score a century in this, then his wait will be stretched too long because after that India will play international matches in July itself
 tab bhartiya team teen test match khilne ke liye srilanka daure par jaaegi

 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray has said that there will be a "riot" if leaders of North Indian origin do not stop making such provocative statements in Mumbai

 Mumbai Congress chief Kripashankar Singh and Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi have supported Nirupam
 raaj ne kaha ki yadi aise netaa is tarah ke bayaan dete rahe to danga ho jayega
 Appealing to the state government to rein in the North Indian leaders, he said that if the situation gets out of hand, the government will be responsible for it
 unhone daawa kiya ki mumbai bich par chhath puja kaa aayojan uttar bhartiya netaaon dwaara takat kaa pradarshan karnaa he
 Targeting his cousin Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray, he said that Shiv Sena has brought fame to Nirupam

 ‚Äô Maharankar's Sharangadhar Balaji sits on the banks of the Pranitha river of Buldhana, 350 km from Nagpur
 jinaki divya murti ke saath viraaje he bramha, vishnu or mahesh
 Visions of three deities together make this temple special and wonderful
 kehete hai ye teenon devtaa sawan ke maheene main saakshaat dharti par utar kar bhakton kii jholii bharte hai
 During the month of Sawan, the importance of worship and consecration increases here because Brahma, Palanhar Vishnu and the destroyer Bhagavan Shiva are the creators of Shrishti
 is mandir kii sabase badi visheshta he balaji kii 12 feet kii pratimaa jo hajaaron saal puraani he
 It is said that there is no bigger idol of Balaji anywhere in the world
 is mandir main aakar bhakton ko ek alokik anubhuti hoti he
 Coming here brings peace to the mind and satisfaction to the soul
 saath hi tridev se maangi har mannath puri hone kaa vishwaas bhi bhakton ko yahaan khinch laata he
 The Puranas describe the temple
 This temple is as beautiful as it is ancient
 is mandir kaa ullekh padam puraana, matsay puraana ke saath-saath bhagwat gita main bhi kiya gaya he
 It is said that once Parvati asked Shiva, which temple is there on earth where visiting in the month of Sawan can give relief from suffering and peace of mind
 tab shiv ji ne parvati ko isi balaji ke darshan kaa mahatv bataaya
 Due to this importance mentioned in the Puranas, devotees come here from far away for worship and consecration
 balaji mandir ke pujari narendra vaakani bataate hai ki sawan ke maheene main bhakt yahaan aakar gita or vishnu sahastranam kaa paath karte hai
 This temple not only has a simultaneous darshan of Tridev, but this grand idol also has visions of Dashavatara of Vishnu, that is why it is said that one can have darshan of Devlok here
 patni mahalakshmi ke saath virajte hai vishnuyah duniya kaa akelaa aisa mandir he jahaan bhagwaan vishnu virajte hai apni patni mahalakshmi ke saath
 Mahalakshmi is seated near the feet of Lord Vishnu in the Sharangadhar temple of Mahakar
 kaha jaataa he ki yahaan jo bhi bhagwaan kii sharan main aata he usapar lakshmi bhi dhan barsaati hai
 By the way, Balaji i
e
 Vishnu sits alone in every temple, but this is the only temple where Mahalakshmi sits with him and has his eyes fixed on the feet of God
 yani jo bhagwaan ki sharan main aata he lakshmi khud va khud usase prasann ho jaati hai
 Pooja in Sawan is of special importance
in this temple of ten incarnated Balaji in the month of Savan, the consecration of the Lord starts from Monday morning and devotee hours recite Vishnu Sahastranam here
 is paavan maheene main balaji ko roj nai poshaak pahana kar shringaar kiya jaataa he
 In this temple you have darshan of Lord Vishnu in every corner
 kaha jaataa he ki yahaan aap jis rup kii kalpana kar murti kii ore dekhte hai usee rup main balaji kii mudra dikhaai detii he, yahaan aane waalon ne ye is anokhe chamatkaar ko mahasoos bhi kiya he
 What is the story of the temple? The Puranas also mention the story of this temple of Bala ji, it is said that on this bank of the river Pranitha lived a powerful demon named Meghankar who used to harass sages and sages who were engaged in the penance of Shiva and in penance
 Used to interrupt and disrupt
 isse pareshaan hokar rishiyon ne shivaji ko prasann kar usne mukti kaa maarg poocha to shivaji kaha iske sanhaar kaa shastr vishnu ji se paas he jise shaarang kehete hai
 Then the sages did penance, pleased with which Vishnu slaughtered Mahangkar with a sharani Rupi bow
 iske baad se is jagah ko mahakar ke shaarangdhar balaji kaha jane laga
 Sharang Dhanush is clearly seen in the idol of God in this temple too
 jarur karen darshanamandir main divya murti ke darshan ke saath thik mandir ke saamne viraaje hai unke vaahan garud jinke darshan kiye bagaiyr lautnaa shubh nahin mana jaataa
 Also, there is a belief that all the gods come to this temple in the month of Sawan
 atah sawan ke maheene main is mandir kaa mahatv kai guna bad jaataa he

 At the beginning of the letter, Farhan wrote, 'how do i start by telling you about rape and sexual violence
 koi bhi pita apane bacchon kii suraksha hi chahta he lekin hamen in baton ko disks karnaa hi hoga
 i would like to start with a poem that i wrote after the 2012 murder of a lawyer from my team
 us samay tum bahut choti thi
 Just 12 years old
 
 
 us samay main tumhen bas muskuraate hue dekhnaa chahta tha
 The matter of rape and murder was not right for you at that time
 'amitabh ne likhaa nathin or potee ke naam khulaa khat
 
 
 Farhan writes, 'now you are 16 years old and i am able to read your daily questions
 vahi sawaal main khud se bhi poochta hum
 'farhan further wrote the poem:' What is this country that i live in? That takes away her right to love Brutalises her with an iron gloverapes her without fear of being justice for her tear
 
 
 
 
 
 what do i tell my daughter? That she's growing up to be lamb for the slaughterwe've got to make a changereboot, reformat, rearrange, and never give inno matter how much our head may spinjust keep asking the questionwhat is this country that i live in? 'farhan has also asked some serious questions in the letter
 jaise, 'jo main pahananaa chaahati hum wo kyon nahin pahan sakati? main dusron kii tarah aaazaad kyon nahin hum?' farhaan ne aage likhaa, 'haa, ham asurakshit samaaj main rahete hai
 But we never told you what you should wear and what not
 tumne bollywood industry ke bare main bahut baar poocha he or maine har baar tumhaare sawaalon kaa jawaab diya he
 'as filmmakers, we cannot make any kind of films by blindfolding us
 hamaare audiyans ham par bharosa karte hai isliye hamen antertenment ke naam par kuch bhi nahin bananaa chahie
 Farhan emphasized that every issue in the society should be talked about openly
 fasebuk par ek video is samay khub dhooma machaa rahaa he, isamen daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki instant noodle megi main swaad badhaane ke chakkar main boar kii charbi kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 a page called Secret Indian on Facebook uploaded this video with this claim
 is video main ye bhi kaha gaya ki aise kai anya package food hai jisamen aisa flavor enhansar daalaa jaataa he jo boar kii charbi se banataa he
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim of the video is misleading
 is videoko lagbhag 6
 More than 3 lakh people have seen and more than 9000 people have also shared it
 video kaa archive varjan aapyahandekh sakate hai
 The title of the video reads 'maggi khate ho ho spread the truth'
 shuruyaat main video lez chips main swaad badhaane ke liye istemaal hue enhansar ke bare main bataata he or daawa karata he ki isamen boar kii charbi hoti he
 It is then said in the video that this enhancer is used in many foods
 video main ye bhi bataaya gaya ki kaise boar kii charbi ko 18veen sadi main kai chizon ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa tha
 The video talks about making people aware of Maggi consumption but there is no mention of Maggi in the entire video
 video ke daawey ko sach tehraane ke liye enhansar kaa naam diya ja rahaa he
 The video, focused on this enhancer itself, said that international companies started writing enhancers code to secretly add pig fat
 kai flavor enhansar jaise E631 or E635 khaadya padaarthon main milaae jate hai jo jaanwaron kii charbi se banate hai
 These foods include Maggi and Lays, but this claim is not new
 google search main kai log isi flavor enhansar ke daawey ko sach tehraane kii koshish kaa rahe hai
 AFWA found that there is no firm evidence for this claim
 haalanki e 635 (disodium 5'-ribonucleotides) or E631 (disodium inosinate) jaanwaron se hi praapt kiye ja sakate hai,lekin jaanavar hi is enhansar kaa eklauta strot nahin hai
 Nestl√© has its website faqhttps: / / www

 The in / faq section clearly states that beetroot and yeast are used to make Maggie's e 635 enhancer that is not taken from animals
 lez ne bhi pehle bataaya he ki vah apane e 631 ke liye tapioka kaa istemaal karata he jo ek paudhe se aata he

 In Uttarakhand, the flood of havoc has passed, but after the havoc the tees are not letting people live
 kabhi apane kuubasurat nazaaron or tirthayatraaon ke liye mashhoor is soobe main ab kuch bachaa he, to vah he maut, malba or matam
 
 
 The pictures of sobering Uttarakhand will surprise you
 devbhumi uttarakhand kii bhayanak tasviir dekhne bhar se rongte khadey ho jate hai, jism main siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 Seeing this, there is a havoc of natural havoc, but no one can imagine the devastation that is desired, because whatever you think, this catastrophe is more than that
 rambadarambada vah jagah he, jahaan se guzare bagaiyr shraddhaluon kii chaar dham kii yatra puri hi nahin ho sakati
 But what happened after the cloudburst in the same Rambade on the night of 16 June, it is also impossible to narrate in Alphaz
 kedarnath dham se kareeb 7 kilometre pehle is kasbe main kareeb 90 guest house, makaan or dukaan hua karte the
 But now there is something left, it is just debris and dead bodies lying everywhere
 kudarat ke is kahar ke baad rambada kii jo pehali tasviir saamne ai, use dekhnaa bhi mushkil he
 Whether human beings and animals, the inundation of death has spread everyone in his arms and scattered it in such a way that life has disappeared
 ret-pathar or malbe ke saath-saath har taraf bikhare saamaan is baat kii gavaahi dete hai ki kabhi yahaan bhi ek khushhaal duniya aabaad hua karti thi
 But suddenly the flood did not allow anyone to recover
 kahin kapade, kahin chappal, to kahin doodh kii katori
 
 
 Located near Tilwara Uttarakhand near Rudraprayag, this town has a different story of its ruin
 mandakini nadi main ai baadh ne raaton-raat tilwara ko kuch aise ujaada ki yahaan taraf tabaahi faili he
 What schools, what houses and shops, floods and stones from the mountains have disintegrated everything
 kitne log gaayab hue hai or kitnon kii maut hui he, ye ab tak khud tilwara ke bashindon tak ko sahi-sahi pataa nahin he
 a petrol pump built on the banks of the Mandakini river is now swinging in the air due to soil erosion
 vahiin gaanv kaa hai skool khandhar main tabdeel ho gaya he
 Now the school has to shift to other places under compulsion
 gharon kii haalat aisi he ki use bayaan karnaa bhi mushkil he
 But the worst case is that of those who are alive here, for whom now living also has become a challenge
 sawaal vahi he ki tamaam barbaadi ke baavjood log akhir apni mitti, apane khet or apana ghar-baar chhodkar akhir jaaen bhi to kahaan jaaen?srinagaruttrakhand kaa yah kasbaa ab achaanak zamin se kai feet neeche chalaa gaya he
 In this way, the debris or mud that came with the water in the town has surrounded the place so that all the houses and shops built here are now buried many feet below
 srinagar main bane esasabi yani seemaa suraksha bal kaa training camp bhi is haadase kaa buree tarah shikaar hua he
 The solar system on the roof of a building has been completely submerged in mud
 uttarkashiutrakhand ke srinagar se dur uttarkashi kaa najaara bhi kuch vaisaa hi he
 Despite both these places being about 132 kilometers away from each other, the devastation is almost the same at both the locations
 raste dhul gaye hai, bastiyon or aabaadi kaa namonishaan mit gaya he
 Houses and vehicles can be seen here to understand how the flood was affected in the mohalla of Uttarkashi
 kuch log ab yahaan baithkar haathon se apni gadiyon main bhari mitti ko nikaalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But how long he will be able to complete this work, no one knows
 sach to yah he ki uttarkashi kaa yah puraa kaa puraa shahar hi malbe ke dher main samaa chukaa he
 Govindghat: Almost the same condition is in Govindghat area
 yahaan bhi makaan, dukaan, gurudwara, hotel sabakuch barbaad ho chukaa he
 Looking at the pictures of the Govindghat gurudwara, it can be understood that the effect of the floods must have happened here
 baadh ke vakt jo jab jis haal main rahaa, use jaan bachaane ke liye usee haal main bhaagna padaa
 Those who could not escape, they descended from the sky and became victims of death
 gurudware ke aas-paas bikhare logon ke saamaan, juute-chappal, prasad or kitaaben bataa rahi hai ki is jagah alaknanda nadi ne apana gussa kis kadar utaara
 Sitapur Village: This village of Champawat tehsil is one of the most heavily hit areas of the flood
 gaanv main sadakon kii jagah bade-bade pattharon kii dher ne jagah le lee he
 The houses have been torn apart
 jo bache hai, wo bhi rahane laayak nahin hai
 Somewhere the goods are scattered, somewhere the car is buried under the soil, and somewhere the bottle of Ganga water in the hands of a devotee is lying like this
 in chizon ke maalik koun hai, koi nahin jaanata
 The condition is such that even the heart of stone itself becomes sweaty, then how can a human being stop his tears? Udri village Like Sitapur, the village of Udri is also crying eight tears on the fate of its fate
 puraa gaanv tabah ho chukaa he or logon ke liye rahane kii jagah nahin bachi he
 Birhithik In the same way, the river edge in Birhi has overthrown all the things that come in its path, as if a storm takes away things that have come in its way
 kabhi yahaan gadhwal mandal kaa ek hotel hua karata tha
 But now there is nothing but a broken wall
 lekin yah uttarakhand kii tabaahi kaa ant nahin he, balki tabaahi or barbaadi kii kahaniyaan abhi or bhi hai
 How does death stand an inch away? To find out, there are not one, but hundreds of stories in Uttarakhand
 lekin in tamaam kisson ke baavjood is pahari soobe main zindagi ek baar phir se karavat le rahi he
 Somewhere the missing paths are being redrawn from the maps, and the broken straws are being added
 gangotrigangotri ke paas pesh aae manzar kaa tasawwur karne ke liye ek taxi ko dekhnaa hi kaafii he
 But luckily the stone fell on this unfortunate car, not on its rear, but on the bonnet, which destroyed the car, but all the people in this vehicle survived narrowly
 kehete hai naa, zindagi zindaadilii kaa naam he, isiilie in tamaam dushwariyon ke baavjood uttarakhand main log phir se apane pairon par khadey hone kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Joshimathak is once again making way by ripping through the mountains, then somewhere between the river banks, new age people are looking for the hope of life in cricket
 dua kiijie ki insaanon kii yah koshish phir se rang laae or uttarakhand phir se khadaa ho jaae
 The government's move to link PAN and Aadhaar card has been liked by a large number of people
 saath hi ek badi samasya bhi saamne ai he
 The addition of PAN card and Aadhaar card has revealed the leakage of a large amount of personal details
 data ke durupyog kar liye jane kii chintaa sata rahi he
 To get to the depth of this, two surveys were conducted
 jinamevalag-alag baat saamne ai he
 The first survey was conducted by the online platform Local Circles
 jisamen paaya gaya ki kareeb do tihaai logon ko apana aadhaar card banavaane kii vartmaan prakriya ke dauraan unka data li hone kaa andeshaa he
 Also, due to banks and telecom operators having access to the Aadhaar card, the details are likely to be leaked
 local circuiles ke is surveykshan main 10,729 main shaamil hue
 In the second survey, 70 per cent of the people supported the government's move to link Aadhaar with PAN to increase compliance levels
 kareeb 27 fisadi logon ne iskaa virodh kiya jabaki teen fisadi ne kei raay nahin vyakt kii
 The survey was conducted at 9,847
 vitt adhinium, 2017 main karadaataaon ke liye pan ko aadhaar se jodna anivaary banaaya he
 The government has made it mandatory to have Aadhaar for applying for PAN
 yah ek july, 2017 se lagu hoga
 By doing this, the subsidy is reaching the target category
 saath hiakar vibhagalabhaarthi or ygroup main link kii pushti kar saktaa he
 The government believes that Aadhaar is a very effective solution to curb tax evasion and monitor black money
 bharat ke sabase charchit itihaaskaaron main se ek romila thapar ne bhartiya itihaas anusandhan parishad (isiechaaar) ke adhyaksh ke rup main vaai
 Commenting adversely on the appointment of Sudarshan Rao
 unki vidwata or mukaam kaa puraa sammaan karte hue main chand tathyon or is maamle se jude asahmatipurna vichaaron par roshni daalana chahta hum
 His biggest complaint is that most historians are not familiar with Rao's work
 unhone pratishthit samikshatmak patrikaon main bhartiya mahakavyon kii aitihaasikta par lekh aadi bhi nahin likhe hai
 In such a situation, some of his research has not been seen
 yah sach he, lekin hamen yah bhi to sochna padegaa ki badakismati se hamaare zyaadaatar shaikshik kendron or prakaashan agenciyon par vampanthi dalon ke rajanetaaon kaa kabja he
 He is very hesitant to identify people outside his community
 kai swayambhu marxvaadi lekhak sankeern sampradayik vichaaron kaa poshan karte hai
 They claim that they are never wrong, but they are not tolerant of other approaches
 isiechaaar ke sadsy sachiv (1990-92) or iske adhyaksh (2001-03) ke rup main kaary karte hue maine parishad par chand kendriya vishvavidhyalayon (jeenyu, aligarh or kalakatta) ke ekadhikaar ko khatm karne ke liye kai kadam uthaae
 i consider both historians like Babri Masjid Group and Ram Janmabhoomi Group as fundamentalists
 marxvaadi itihaaskaaron kaa tabaka sampradayik nahin tha phir bhi usne raajnneeti se prerit hokar chhipe taur par babari masjid kheme kii tarafdaari kii
 The pro-hindutva light-hearted strategy was half-hearted, while the 'marxist' light-hearted strategy was moot
 pehali bijepi sarkaar ke vakt jab main isiechaaar main adhyaksh tha, us samay vaai
 Sudarshan Rao was a member of ICHR
 parishad main baarah duusare itihaaskaaron ke mukaable chah itihaaskaaron vaala hindutv samooh chota tha
 Rao's views were against the majority ideology that i was guiding as president, but he seemed to me to be a completely dignified and open-minded man
 main mahakavyon kii aitihaasik pramanikta ke sambandh main pesh unke nazariye se sahamat nahin, phir bhi main maanata hum ki kai itihaaskaar aise drushtikon rakhte hai or main shodh ko aage badhaane ke liye tareekon kaa chunaav karne ke unke loktantric adhikaar kaa samarthan karata hum
 There is no final stage to reach a historical conclusion and there should be an open debate on all
 is silsile main maine hameshaa dekha he ki kisi bhi ruudhivaadee hindutvvaadi vichaar ke prati sahanubhuti rakhane vaala fasivadi qaraar de diya jaataa he or 'marxvaadi‚Äô use daboch lete hai, jabaki duusare samudaayon ke ugrapanthi tatwon ko dharmanirpekshata ke naam par sangrakshan diya gaya he
 Historians doing research on Hindutva should have an opportunity to get their ideas published in reputed research journals of institutes under their leadership
 vaise bhi romila thapar kii tarah sabhi ko to bada shodh karne ke liye bharat se baahar ke adhik suvidhapurna shodh kendron main prashikshan hasil karne kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 i object to Thapar's harsh remarks about the Minister of Human Resource Development
 shaikshanik yogyata ko hamaare samaaj main yogyata kaa paimaana nahin mana ja saktaa jahaan ucchtam shaikshik kendron par congress party yaa marxvad ke himachati vidwaanon ne niyantran or ekadhikaar jamaa rakhaa he
 Thapar in one of his statements has criticized Rao's claim in one place that he insisted on the presence of archaeological evidence of a temple there before the construction of the Babri Masjid
 ve is daawey ko kaaphi had tak ek rajnatik bayaan tehra rahi hai kyonki ayodhya main vivaadaaspad sthal par hui khudaai kii report abhi tak saarvajanik nahin kii gai he
 In this context i would like to draw his attention to the hari-vishnu inscriptions written by Govind Chandra in Nagari script and Sanskrit language which were found between two layers of the wall of the Babri Masjid and which were given by the Department of Ancient History, Culture and Archeology at Nagpur University
 It was published by Ajay Mitra Shastri, head of the department
 govind chandra ke shilaalekh 11veen or 12veen isvi ke hai jinamein vishnu-hari ke ek adbhut mandir kii baat kahi gai he jo saketmandal main sthit mandiron ke shahar ayodhya main banaaya gaya tha
 According to the inscription, vishnu-hari was the destroyer of Bali and Dashanan
 yah dastavej is baat kaa saaf saboot he ki babari masjid banane ke pehle vahaan ek vishnu mandir tha
 Interestingly, King Govind Chandra, who built the Ayodhya temple, was an advocate of revivalist Brahminism and ruler of Uttara Kosala (then where Ayodhya was located) who had enmity with the Turks
 unhone varanasi kii turkon se raksha kii thi
 After Govind Chandra, Vijay Chandra ascended the throne

 MGS Narayanan has been the President of ICHR

 While the party faced criticisms of its senior leaders Maneka Gandhi and Uma Bharti on Friday for the inclusion of former tainted minister Babusinh Kushwaha in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party justified its decision
 That this was done to give leadership to the marginalized backward classes
 gyaat ho ki uttar pradesh main karodon rupee ke swasthya ghotaale main bhrashtachar ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) se nikaale gaye mantri kushvaha ko bhaajapa main shaamil kiye jane par menka gandhi or uma bharti donon ne saarvajanik rup se apni naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 Maneka Gandhi told reporters, "we should not have included any tainted or corrupt leader expelled from the BSP in our party
" " Maneka, an MP from Amla in Uttar Pradesh, said that the state unit of the party did not consult before including Kushwaha
 unhone kaha, "bhaajapa kii puri rajya ikai is faisle se pareshaan he
 " uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main prachaar abhiyaan main jutin uma bharti ne bhi party ke is faisle par virodh darj karaayaa
 Uma, however, denied reports that he had postponed his campaign to protest against the decision to include Kushwaha in the party
 chunaav prachaar main jutin uma ne patrakaron se kanpur main kaha, "mujhe jo kuch kahana he use main party ke manch par kahuungi
 i will not put my point in the media on party issues
 " After this, he issued a statement saying that the news going on in this regard is baseless
 uma ne kaha, "subah se hi mere naam se vibhinn samachar madhyamon main lagaataar khabaren prasaarit kii ja rahi hai ki main chunaav prachaar nahin karuungi, lekin maine is tarah kii koi tippanee nahin kii he
 " gauratlab he ki vibhinn samachar channelon par subah se hi aisi khabaren chal rahi thim ki babu singh kushvaha ko party main liye jane se naaraaz hokar uma bharti ne kendriya netaaon se safataur par kah diya he ki vah ab aage chunaav prachaar nahin karengi
 Uma has said in her statement that no political intent should be taken of those reports
 unhone kaha he ki agle chaar din ke saghan daure main vah 30 chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit karengi or aagaamee kaarykram bhi unki sahmati se hi tay kiye jaaenge
 At the same time, the BJP justified its decision, saying that other parties have not given leadership to the marginalized sections, hence it has given place to the backward classes in the party
 bhaajapa pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki kushvaha ko party main isliye shaamil kiya gaya kyonki vah pichde varg se aate hai lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki party bhrasht logon ko sangrakshan de rahi he
 The comments kushvaha ke naam par party ke bheetar uth rahe virodh ko dekhte hue bhaajapa ko ghoshnaa kerani padi he ki rajya ke vidhansabha chunaavon main vah kushvaha ko tikat or koi pad nahin degi
 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters, "the party will neither give tickets to Kushwaha nor any post
 " Both Maneka Gandhi and Uma Bharti publicly expressed their displeasure over the allegations of corruption in the multi-crore rupees health scam in Uttar Pradesh and the inclusion of Minister Kushwaha, who was expelled from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), in the BJP
 Has expressed menka gandhi ne patrakaron se kaha, "hamen basapa se nikaale gaye kisi daagi athwa bhrasht netaa ko apni party main shaamil nahin karnaa chahie tha
 " uttar pradesh ke aanwala se saansad menka ne kaha ki party kii pradesh ikai ne kushvaha ko shaamil karne se pehle paraamarsh nahin kiya
 He said, "the entire state unit of BJP is upset with this decision
 " Uma Bharti, who was campaigning in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, also lodged a protest against the party's decision
 uma ne haalanki, in rapaton kaa khandan kiya ki unhone kushvaha ko party main shaamil karne ke faisle par virodh jataane ke liye apane abhiyaan ko sthagit kar diya he
 Uma, who was campaigning in the election, told reporters in Kanpur, "whatever i have to say, i will say it on the party platform
 party ke muddon par main media main apni baat nahin rakhuungi
 " iske kuch der baad unhone ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki is sambandh main jo khabaren chal rahi hai, ve bebuniyaad hai
 Uma said, "since morning, news is being circulated continuously in various media in my name that i will not campaign, but i have not made any such comment
 " Significantly, there were reports on various news channels since morning that Uma Bharti, angry over Babu Singh Kushwaha being taken to the party, has clearly told the central leaders that she will not campaign any further
 uma ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki un khabaron kaa koi raajnneetik mantavya na nikaala jaae
 She has said that she will address 30 election meetings in the next four days of intensive tour and the upcoming events will also be decided with her consent
 vahiin, bhaajapa ne apane faisle ko uchit tehraate hue kaha ki anya partiyon ne haashie par gaye virgo ke logon ko netritv nahin diya he, isliye usne party main pichde varg ko jagah di he
 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said that Kushwaha was included in the party because he comes from backward classes but that does not mean that the party is giving protection to corrupt people
 tippaniyan In view of the opposition within the party in the name of Kushwaha, BJP has to declare that it will not give ticket and any post to Kushwaha in the state assembly elections
 bhaajapa netaa ravishankar prasad ne patrakaron se kaha, "party kushvaha ko na to tikat degi or na hi koi pad
 " menka gandhi ne patrakaron se kaha, "hamen basapa se nikaale gaye kisi daagi athwa bhrasht netaa ko apni party main shaamil nahin karnaa chahie tha
 " uttar pradesh ke aanwala se saansad menka ne kaha ki party kii pradesh ikai ne kushvaha ko shaamil karne se pehle paraamarsh nahin kiya

 ve sabase pehle aisland jaaenge, uske baad switzraland or ant main unhen slovenia pahunchnaa he
 During his visit to these countries, President Ramnath Kovind may raise the issue that removal of Kashmir or Article 370 is an internal issue of India, so there is no need for any other country to interfere in it
 raashtrapati kovind kii switzraland yatra tab ho rahi he jab geneva main sanyukt raashtra maanav adhikaar kaa satr shuru hone ja rahaa he
 Recently, a statement issued by the Swiss Federal Department said that the situation in Kashmir and India's territorial status' could be discussed between President Kovind and his Swiss counterpart Uyeli Maurer in Berne on 13 September
 baj nahin aa rahaa pakistanpakistan ne bharat ke raashtrapati ramnath kovind ke vimaan ko apane hawaii kshetra se udne kii anumati dene ke nai dilli ke aagrah ko shanivaar ko thukraa diya
 Foreign Minister Qureshi said that Prime Minister Imran Khan welcomed the decision to reject India's request and said that Pakistan had to take this decision because India has shown aggression on Kashmir

 pradhanmantri narendra modi apane do divasiy anaupchaarik china ke daure par vuhaan shahar pahunch gaye hai
 PM Modi will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping today
 lekin bada sawaal he ki kya pradhanmantri modi china kii dhokhe or avishvaas vaali us maansikta ko khatm karne main kaamyaab ho paaenge jiske chalate donon deshon ke sambandh ek kadam aage badhate hai to do kadam peeche hat jate hai
 The relationship between India and China stands at a distance of thirty years
 baton main bharose kii koshish lekin jameen par avishvaas kaa maahaul
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have an informal but summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping
 to sawaal he ki kya is mulaakaat main un muddon kaa hal nikalegaa, jisane bharat kii saradardi badha di he
 Will the first challenge of these issues come out - will this meeting play a major role in ending the india-china conflict in Doklam? The second challenge is about China's interference in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir whether at the cost of relations with India He will continue to build roads and other infrastructure here
 teesri chunauti-kya masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit karne kii bharat kii koshishon kaa samarthan karegaa yaa aage bhi adnga hi lagayegaa
 The fourth challenge - will China be ready to support India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group, or NSG
 paanchavin chunauti-us kaarobaari asantulan ko mitaane kii he, jisamen china ne to bharat ke bazaar par kaaphi had tak kabja kar rakhaa he lekin bharat ke liye china kaa market abhi taiyaar nahin he
 These questions arise because soon after becoming the Prime Minister, PM Modi called Chinese President Xi Jinpingco to India, but at the time when Xi Jinping was swinging on the banks of Sabarmati river, at that time Chinese soldiers entered into Chumar of Jammu and Kashmir
 kya bharat or china ke rishte phir se 1988 ke vakt main tehre hue hai?1988 mengis vakt rajeev gandhiini raashtrapatideng jioping se mulaakaat kar rahe the, us vakt samdorong main china kaa atikaraman tha or ab jab pradhanmantri modi shi jinping se milenge to doklam kaa vivaad sir par khadaa he
 Vijay Gokhale, who made that trip to China successful for Rajiv Gandhi, was the first secretary in China, who is the foreign secretary in the Modi government
 badi baat ye he ki tees saal pehle rajeev bhi us vakt china kii yatra par the jab ek saal baad chunaav hone vaala tha
 Now Modi too has gone when he has to go among the public after one year
 darasal 1954 main tab ke pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne china ke saath nae rishton kii buniyaad rakhane ke makasad se vahaan kii yatra kii thi
 But that foundation turned out to be weak because it added sand of deception to the cement of India's trust
 tab se koshishen bahut huin lekin kamyaabi nahin mili
 Now trying again, what is the harm in keeping hope

 varsh 2005 main america videsh mantralay ne modi kaa vija nirast kar diya tha
 The basis of this action was stated to be the alleged violation of human rights after the 2002 riots in Gujarat

 "ramleela is said to have originated in India from Banaras
 vahiin se dhire-dhire desh ke duusare hisson or dakshin-purvi asia ke deshon main bhi pahunchi
 According to scholars, Tulsidas himself and some of his associates, who wrote Ramcharit Manas, took this initiative

 vaise hi kaashi kii 20-22 din kii ramlilaon kaa sabase lokapriy pratinidhi prasang ban gaya he naati imali kaa bharat milaap
 Its original episode is barely five minutes, but for this too, it has created a lot of tension, an interesting role and an entire sociology
 bharat milaap ke baad ram or bharat aadi ke waapas ayodhya lautne ke liye kaam main laayaa jane vaala 15 foot chaudaa or 12 foot lanbaa rath nau ton kaa he
 Up to 12‚Äì13 people, including all forms, ride on it
 yah bharat milaap dekhne ke liye 'kaashi naresh' anant narayan singh ramnagar se aate hai or peeche kii ore hathi par virajit rahete hai
 To see this scene, relatives and relatives from far-off places come to the nearby houses and camp on the rooftops
 yahaan tak ki is prasang ko lekar logon main tarah-tarah ke kisse tak chal pade hai
 One of these, no matter how bad the weather is, but 4 in the evening
 45 baje bharat milaap ke samay suraj kii roshni ram or bharat ke upar padegi hi
 Actually, the stage is also built in such a way, where the sunlight comes directly
 bharat milaap ke baad vishaal rath ko shahar ke yadav samaaj ke log uthaate hai
 They are not even sent for this, etc
 ve ise apana adhikaar samajhate hai
 There may be only 60-70 people who seem to be together, but with preparation, several hundred hawkish wrestlers of the society go along, to swap

 After all what? To learn and teach this tradition properly
 inkaa us din kaa khaas pahanava bhi hota he: nai safed ganji, sir par laal gamchaa, dhoti or ankhon main kaajal
 The first aarti and the enjoyment of the right have been the gopi wrestler family of Kabir Chaura for four generations before the forms of Leela were placed in the chariot
 ve 1980 se 25 saal tak banaras kesari rahe hai
 His nephew Babu has contested in the junior category in a national level wrestling competition
 us din kii apni taiyaariyon ke bare main gopi ke chote bhai omprakash yadav banarsi lahaze main bataate hai, ''uu din puri, curry, kheer, bhari puri acha-acha khaike nikaral ja laa
 brother! God is surrounded by 14 years later
 khusi ho laa
 "walking barefoot for an hour, these bumpy carriers take the chariot to 'ayodhya'
 isamen gopi parivaar ke alaava kabir chaura, bula pura, maidagin, bada ganesh or brahmanal aadi muhalla ke yadav shirkat karte hai
 This is also a special occasion for the youth of this community, because during this time they are also liked for marriage
 gaur talab he ki naati imali ke usee maidan par thik duusare din mauni baba ramlila samiti kaa bharat milaap hota he, jo is baar 24 aktubar ko he
 Its chariot is a little small but the people of this Yadav society are also picking it up
 usamen 'kaashi naresh' kii bhi shirkat nahin hoti
 From the perspective of direct participation in the pastimes, an interesting picture of a social fabric appears to be formed
 ram, lakshmana, bharat, shatrughna or sita ke mukhya swaroopon ke liye 10 se 13 saal ke yagyopavitadhari brahman bacchon ko hi chunaa jaataa he
 Why they only? There has been a lot of debate about it before, but it is the same tradition at the moment
 in swaroopon ko lila ke samay samvaad bataane yani procpator kaa kaam vyas kaa hota he
 Couplets, chaupaiyas and bhajans sing Ramayani
 kuch jagahon par sazindon kii bhi toli hoti he
 Singaria is an important role, which is often a big Seth of the city
 masalan chitrakoot ramlila samiti ke singaaria, banarsi sari ke vyapaaree, krishna gopal and company ke bulaaki das shahar ke bade udhyami hai
 In the words of the committee's administrator Mukund Upadhyay, "even if the Prime Minister does not call, he should not leave, but the day of Leela is 22 days from 4 pm to 10-11 pm
 swaroopon ke shringaar ke alaava khunta gadwa, dari bichaana sab kaam karte hai
 "on the other hand, take 70-year-old Khadchand

 Earn daily wages
 lekin lila ke dinon main 20-22 din unki shaamein manch par hi bitati hai
 In the Leela of Mauni Baba Committee, they take any role like Sursa, Bali, Sushen and Sampati according to the context
 30 saal se yah silsilaa jari he
 The role of, let's start the dialog
 jan judaav kaa ek doosraa pahalu dekhie: kashipura kii ramlila ke dinon main to nai log bade stage ke takhton ke neeche maje main baithkar bal banaate rahete hai
 Apart from Vyas, Ramayani, Singaria, Chariot Carrier and Bhajan Mandali, an important role is of importance in the pastimes
 yani gas jalaane, aatishbaajee chalaane ke alaava ravan aadi ke putale banane kaa kaam
 This is done only by people from Muslim families
 chitrakoot lila ke mahataabi 45 varshiya habib apni chauthi peedi main yah jikvama sambhaal rahe hai
 When asked about being associated with this tradition for so long, he says, "there is a lot of hard work in this work
 par jab tak jinda hai tab tak sanbhaalenge, roshni karenge, uske baad allaa jaanai
 "even today, instead of chemical colors, sandalwood, roli, ramaraj are adorned in the major pastimes, which Premchand has also described in his story Ramlila in a very interesting way
 swaroopon ko kirit or bulaak lag jane ke baad maan liya jaataa he ki ab ve roopantarit ho gaye
 Now they have to behave in the same way
 jhaanki pradhan in lilaon main samvaad 'daal main namak' ke baraabar hote hai
 In addition to Tulsi in singing, verses of Sura, Kabir and Bhajan are sung
 ek lila ke kevat samvaad main raidas kaa pad gaaya jaataa he
 The expenditure on the entire event is Rs 2-3 lakh
 ke bich baithta he, jabaki zyaadaatar log apni sevaayen aasthaa bhav se hi dete hai
 The Chitrakoot Committee has a Marwari financier, but Shriram Sharma, the administrator of the Mauni Baba Committee, collects small and large amounts with the receipt
 banaras kii in lilaon ke saamne ab do mushkilen aa rahi hai
 One is that the Durgapuja, which is represented with modern glare, has pulled the youth towards them
 vishvambharnath mishra kehete bhi hai, ''hamen lilaon main kuch aisi tabdili kerani hogi, jo ki samasamyik ho or jisase yuvaaon ko bhi anand mili
 ‚Äúthe second problem is the hundreds of crores of Leela sites in this extremely dense city
 kii jameen par avaidh kabje kii he
 The organizers are dealing with it in their own way, but looking for a coordinated solution
 baharhaal, jaisaa ki banaras ke ek saanskrithik patrkaar alok paradkar kehete hai, ''lila meley is nagar ke jivan main usee tarah shaamil hai, jaise parivaar ke mangalik kaary

 When Deepika Padukone entered Bollywood, her name was associated with Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 kaha jaataa tha ki dhoni, deepika se shaadi karnaa chaahate hai
 However, nothing like this happened
 deepika hameshaa se kahati ai hai ki dhoni mere fevorett hai, lekin unki choti bahan anisha padukon kaa maananaa he ki dhoni ko ab tii-20 se ritair ho janaa chahie
 Deepika and Anisha recently appeared in Neha Dhupia's chat show bffs With Vogue
 anisha khud ek khilaadi hai
 She plays golf jab unase poocha gaya ki koun se player ko ab ritair ho janaa chahie
 On this, he said that Dhoni should now retire from T20
 deepika ne iske baad turant kaha ki anisha ye baari man se kah rahi hai
 i am a fan of Dhoni
 kisi ko bina bataae do dinon ke liye gaayab ho gai thim deepika padukondipika hameshaa se dhoni kii tarif karti rahati hai
 Deepika also expressed her disappointment when Dhoni retired from the Test
 isi chat sho main jab neha dhoopiya ne deepika se poocha ki unki wedding guest kii list main kya katrina caff kaa naam shaamil hoga? to deepika ne sapaat se kaha nahin
 
 
 From this reply of Deepika, it is clear that this cat fight is still going on
 ranbir kapur kii eks raheen deepika or katrina ke bich anban is kadar bad gai thi ki deepika ne ranbir ko katrina se shaadi nahin karne tak kii salaah de daali thi
 Deepika and Katrina are burning in the fire of Ranbir, Ranveer was not engaged in a quarrel, when Katrina was also questioned in the chat show of Karan Johar, Katrina's silence was also spoken a lot
 vahiin deepika ne ek intervyuu main katrina ke bare main baat karte hue ye kaha tha ki vah unki persenelity or unke kaam karne ke tareeke ko pasand karti hai
 With this, Deepika had said that the kind of feeling you never have for people is not necessarily treating you like that, then it is not a big deal
 dilli ke mashhoor criminal loyr mohammad shahvaar khan kaa maananaa he ki aatank se nibatane ke naam par police ne kai yuvakon ko jhuthe iljaam main fansaa rakhaa he
 Khan, who is fighting a legal battle to prove the innocence of many terrorists, told reporters Arun Singh that there was no evidence about the existence of Indian Mujahideen
 baatcheet ke ansh:aap iem ke kitne aatankwaadiyon ke mukademe lard rahe hai?main iem ke kisi aatanki kii pairvi nahin kar rahaa hum
 Actually, i am advocating for 18-20 innocent people who have been arrested by the police by making false and false accusations
 mere paas 2008 ke paanch maamle (13 agast 2008 ke serial blast), 2010 main jama masjid par hui ghatana ke do maamle or abu jandaal samet 2011 kaa maamla he
 There is no evidence of the existence of the Indian Mujahideen
 mere muvakkilon ko kathith indian mujahidin se jodgaye vaala koi saboot nahin he
 Arshad Madni's Jamiat ulama-e-hind is bearing all the costs of the case
 kitne pakistani aatankwaadi hai?inamen koi pakistani aatankwaadi nahin he, 2011 main giraftaar adil naam kaa ek shaks pakistani naagarik he, jise jama masjid maamle main abhiyukt banaaya gaya he
 The names of Waqas and Tabrez have also come under scrutiny
 ye pakistani mul ke hai?police apni jaanch main baraak obama ko bhi abhiyukt banaakar daawa kar sakati he ki ve visphoton ke liye jimmedaar the, unke kaam kii yahi to khubi he
 In our investigative system, the police first arrest the person and then collect evidence and in this process evidence is often fabricated according to their theory
 ye naam jaanch main shaamil hai, lekin puri jaanch main yah kahin nahin he ki ye naam asli hai yaa managasaint, or police ke daawey kii pushti karne vaala koi saboot nahin he
 How many cases are there against Yasin Bhatkal
 jaanch agenciyon ne us par aarope lagaaya he ki vah 2008 ke baad kii sari ghatnaon ke liye jimmedaar he, lihaaja yah to nahin maaloom ki uske khilaaf kitne maamle hai, lekin dilli main vah kareeb 10 maamalon main vaanchit he
 But once again i want to mention that mere name is not enough to prove the role
 kya sajeesh ke saboot seemaa paar ke taraf bhi ishaara karte hai
 There is no proof
 sabase kamjor saboot kinake khilaaf he or kyon?har maamle main police asli nahin balki managasaint sabooton par bharosa karti he, chunki maamle vichaaradhin hai or mahatvapurn charan main hai lihaaja is bare main kisi bhi tarah ke khulaase se mere muvakkil ke mukademe par gambhir asar padegaa
 There are several facts which show that the whole story of the prosecution is fabricated and they have been implicated in fake and false allegations
 hyderabad blast kii sajeesh kaa sutaradhar aap kise maanate hai?is bare main police-jaanch agenciyaan behatar bataa sakati hai
 My role starts when the case reaches the court

 Kharge has boycotted the meeting many times in the past, opposing being called to the meeting as a special invitee

 He alleged that since coming to power in 2014, this government did not make any effort to amend the Lokpal Act so that the leader of the opposition's largest party could attend the meeting as a member of the selection committee
 isse pehle pichley saal sitambar main khadge ne lokapal ke chayan ke liye samiti kii baithak main hissaa lene se inkaar diya tha
 He said he would not attend the meeting unless he was given full member status instead of a special invitee

 He said, for this reason i am forced to respectfully reject the invitation to attend the selection committee meeting
 main is baithak main tab tak hissaa nahin luungaa, jab tak lokapal adhinium 2013 main sabase bade vipakshi dal ke netaa ko purna sadsy kaa darja nahin diya jaataa he

 gandhivadi anna hazaare paksh ne brihaspativaar ko daawa kiya ki lokapal vidheyak ke apane masaude main sarkaar ne aise praavdhaan kiye hai, jiske tahat bhrasht naukarshahon ke bajaay bhrashtachar kii shikaayat karne waalon ko sakht sajaa milegi
 The Hazare side also called the provisions of the government's draft inappropriate, through which only a few thousand bureaucrats would come under the purview of the Lokpal, and under which he was heard twice before filing a case against the accused of corruption and filing the charge sheet
 Will be able to go lokapal masauda sanyukt samiti main samaaj kii ore se shaamil rahe sadasyon ne ek vaktavy jari kar kaha, jaanch shuru hone se pehle hi naukarshah nagarikon ke khilaaf vishesh adaalat main sidhe javaabi shikaayat daakhil kara sakate hai
 This counter-complaint against the complainants can be filed without any initial investigation by any agency
 vaktavy ke anusaar, centre ke masaude ke tahat sarkaar mukadmaa daayar karne ke liye naukarshahon ko ni:shulk vakil bhi muhaiyaa kara sakati he, lekin nagarikon ko khud hi apana bachaav karnaa hoga
 The Hazare side said that instead of corrupt government bureaucrats, there are provisions for severe punishment for the complainants
 agar koi vishesh adaalat yah kahati he ki shikaayat galat he to nagarikon ko kam se kam do varsh kii sajaa ho sakati he
 But if a corruption charge is proved against a bureaucrat, he will be sentenced to only six months
 hazaare paksh ne daleel di ki lokapal vidheyak kaa sarkaar kaa masauda agar sweekrut ho gaya to uske adhikaar kshetra main to mahaj 0
 5 percent government employees will come, but 100 percent non-government organizations will come under its purview
 vaktavy ke anusaar, sarkaar kaa kahana he ki agar sabhi str ke naukarshahon ko jaanch ke daayre main laayaa gaya to lokapal atyadhik maamalon ke boj tale dab jaayegaa
 Therefore, the government has put only 65,000 Group a employees under the ambit of Lokpal in its draft
 iske chalate centre ke shesh 40 lakh or rajya ke 80 lakh karmchaaree lokapal ke daayre se baahar rahenge
 The Hazare side said that under the government's draft, all types of non-governmental organizations will come under the purview of the Lokpal, whether they are big or small and whether in the states or in the national capital
 yahaan tak sarkaar gaanvon main maujuud apnjikrut samoohon ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main rakhana chaahati he
 The statement states that 4 in the country
 3 lakh panjikrut gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan hai
 But there are also millions of unregistered organizations
 sarkaar dwaara prastaavit lokapal ke daayre main sabhi tarah ke gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan aa jaaenge
 The statement said that under the government draft, all the Residents Welfare Association of Delhi will come under the purview of Lokpal but the officers of Delhi government will not be under its purview
 yahaan tak ki ramlila or durga puja ke liye chanda jutaney vaale samooh bhi lokapal ke daayre main rahenge

 Under this agreement, BJP will contest 5 seats, while Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) managed to win 7 Rajya Sabha seats along with 7 seats
 tamilnadu or puducheri ko milakar loksabhaa kii kul 40 siten aati he
 In this sense, AIADMK and DMDK will contest the remaining seats after the 12 seats in the BJP and pmk's part
 haalanki gathbandhan ke elaan main ediemke kitni siton par ladegi yah abhi tay nahin ho paaya he, kyonki dmdike ke saath uski baatcheet aakhri daur main he
 It is believed that DMDK may get 3-4 seats
 iske alaava bijepi ne elaan kiya he ki party vidhansabha kii 21 siton ke liye hone vaale upachunaav main eidiemke kaa samarthak karegi
 Announcing the alliance, Union Minister Piyush Goyal expressed confidence of victory saying that all parties involved in this alliance will work to strengthen the NDA
 unhone kaha ki ham sabhi 40 siten jeetenge
 This alliance will make a clean sweep in the state in honor of late leader Jayalalithaa
 tamilnadu ke up-mukhyamantri o panniraselvam ne kaha ki ediemke or bijepi ne mahagathbandhan banaaya he, yah ek jitau gathbandhan he jo tamilnadu or puducheri main loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladega
 According to the agreement, BJP has been given 5 seats
 vahiin bijepi 21 siton par hone vaale vidhansabha upachunaav main ediemke ummidavaar kaa samarthan karegi
 On the announcement of the alliance, DMK chief MK Stalin said that the head of PMK was Dr

 Not only this, he had also taken out a book on corruption of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and submitted it to the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu
 kya wo (ramdaus) isse sharminda nahin hai
 Let us tell you that in Tamil Nadu, opposition parties DMK, Congress and Left parties have announced to contest elections together
 is gathbandhan main camel hasan kii nai party ke bhi judane ke asaar hai
 TTV Dinakaran is the third player among them who have not opened their cards
 isse pehle piemke dwaara upie ke saath bhi baatcheet kii khabaron kii charchaa thi
 Let us know that in the last Lok Sabha elections, AIADMK, BJP and PMK fought separate elections

 soochna milane ke baad sanstha ke str par inhen khojane kaa prayaas kiya gaya, lekin inkaa pataa nahin chal sakaa
 According to the superintendent, the behavior of one of these girls was already suspicious
 philhal khunti police ne maamla darj kar liya or maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 The condition of child shelter homes in Jharkhand is also poor
 mujjafarpur aurdevaria main bal aashray grihonmen yon shoshan kii khabaren saamne aane ke baad desh ke sabhi bal grihon kii jaanch kii maang uthne lagi he
 The security of child shelter homes in Jharkhand is very poor
 kai grihon main surakshakarmi kii baat dur suraksha chaharadivari bhi nahin he
 At the same time there are many who are being run in rented houses
 aise main jharkhand sarkaar ko in bal aashray grihon kii suraksha-vyavastha kii khaamiyon ke niraakaran ke liye jald kadam uthaane honge
 From May 1, the Narendra Modi government of the Center has completely banned the installation of red or blue lights on any vehicle
 centre ne yah sunishchit karne kii bhi koshishi kii he koi bhi lalabatti na laga sake, yahaan tak ki police bhi
 Significantly, for the past several decades, the red light has been a symbol of the influence and VIP culture
 udhar, netaaon or baabuon kaa lalabatti se moh khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi 10 days ago stressed on the need to root out the VIP culture that has penetrated deep inside the mind of the people, saying that instead of 'VIP' culture, adopt a culture of 'EPI' i
e
 'every person is important'
 Had appealed modi ne apane radio kaarykram 'man kii baat' main kai muddon par baat kii thi
 The comments 'viipi' samskruti kii charchaa karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, "pehle vaahanon par laal batti lagaai jaati thi, lekin dhire-dhire yah hamaare dimag main ghus gai or hamaari maansikta main jamkar baith gai
 Red light is good to go, but no one can say with certainty that it has gone from our mindset too
 " pichhali raat ko do karyaakaari aadesh kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke vibhaag se jari kiye gaye
 However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said to use the blue light for emergency services
 fire brigade, police, raksha bal athwa ardhsainik balon dwaara kanoon-vyavastha banaae rakhane ke sambandh main or bukamp, baadh, tufaan aadi aapadaa ke samay duty nibhaa rahe adhikariyon ke vaahanon par yah bahurangi batti lag sakati he
 However, when he is not on duty, he will not be able to apply it
 rajya sarkaar har saal aise adhikariyon kii suchi aamajan kii jaankaree ke liye jari karegi, jo bahurangi batti kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 The wind screen of such a vehicle will have stickers issued by the Transport Department
 parivahan vibhaag ke sanyukt sachiv abhaya daamale ne bataaya, "praadhikrut adhikari dwaara ek samay par keval ek vaahan ke liye stikar jari kiya jayega
 " udhar, karnataka ke khaadya va aapurti mantri uti khadar kaa kahana he ki vah lalabatti ko apane sir par lagaakar nahin ghoomte
 As a minister, he got a red light-laden car from the government
 agar rajya kii cabinet yaa phir mukhyamantri unhen aisa karne kaa nirdesh dete hai to vah tatkaal isaki paalna karenge, lekin keval centre ke notification par vah yah kadam nahin uthaane ja rahe
 It is believed that the government is going to make such an effort that anyone ineligible can complain of red light
