 aspx The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday described the possibility of an outbreak of an epidemic in Nepal as the earthquake struck
 bukamp ke baad bemausam barish kii ashanka ke bich nepal main mahamari failane kaa dar bhi vyaapt he
 WHO representative Lin Aung in Xinhua Nenepal was quoted as saying that there are no signs of epidemic risk in Nenepal and the situation is normal
 lin ne kaha, 'kisi bhi bukamp ke baad log visthapit hote hai
 Due to this, the geological water gets contaminated every time and every time there is a danger of spreading
 'unhone aage kaha, 'ham bimariyon par nigaraanee ke liye or kisi tarah ke prakope par nigaraanee ke liye ek pranali sthapit karne vaale hai
 Till now, there has been no news other than the general incidents, nor is there any news of an outbreak of any kind from any camp or any other place
 'dablyuechao se hi sambhddha roderico ofrin ne kaha ki dablyuechao ne ek pranali sthapit kii he, jo is tarah ke maamle ko shuruyaat main hi pakad legi
 He said, 'if this happens, this system will warn us immediately
 '- input IANS Expressing condolences over the death of the 23-year-old Delhi gang-rape victim, former President Pratibha Patil said that the perpetrators of this crime had no right to live
 patil ne shanivaar shaam ek marathi samachar channel se kaha, 'yah maamla durlabhtam shrenee main aata he, isliye mujhe lagata he ki doshiyon ko jeene kaa koi haq nahin he
 Patil said that although the death penalty needs to be debated in Parliament and among law experts, it should be implemented in the rarest of rare cases
 purv raashtrapati ne samaaj kii, visheshkar purushon kii maansikta badalane par jor diya or yuvaaon se maang kii ki vah is tarah kii buraaiyon kaa unmoolan kar badlaav laane main sahyogi bane
 In the midst of a debate on the issue of forgiveness of Rajiv Gandhi's killers, the 20-year-old chief investigator of the case, DR Karthikeyan, is in favor of changing the death sentence of the three accused to life imprisonment
 tamilnadu main in hatyaron kii maut kii sajaa ko badalane kii apil ne bhaavnaatmak rup le liya he
 Amid the debate over the entire issue, Karthikeyan suggested that a special session of Parliament should be convened to discuss the death penalty policies as the decisions taken on regional basis could establish a dangerous tradition
 unhone kaha, mujhe unase vyaktigat taur par koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 i did my work, now let the government do their work
 agar unki maut kii sajaa ko badal kar aaajeevan karawas main badal diya jaae, to mujhe khushi hogi 
 a day after Rajiv Gandhi's death, Karthikeyan was asked to take charge of the Special Investigation Team probing the case
 rajeev kii hatya ko ek saal puraa hone ke ek din pehle unke dal ne aaropapatr daakhil kar diya, jisamen aropiyon ke taur par 41 logon kaa naam diya gaya
 Former police officer Karthikeyan said that the change in the death sentence of Nalini Sriharan could also help three other accused, whose mercy petition has been rejected by President Pratibha Patil
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne murugan, santhan, perarivalan or nalini ko 1999 main maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 The Madras High Court has lately deferred the death sentence of these three for eight weeks
 in teenon ko nau sitambar ko faansee di jaani thi
 Karthikeyan said, they have issue because death sentence of a prisoner has been changed to life imprisonment
 iske alaava ve 20 saal se jail main he, unki dayaa yachika par faisle main bhi 11 saal kaa samay laga he, ve anischitata kaa ek lanbaa daur guzaar chuke hai
 The Padmashri Awardee officer stressed the need to have a uniform policy on capital punishment and cautioned against any selective basis in such cases
 unhone kaha, maut kii sajaa par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye sansad kaa ek vishesh satr bulaayaa janaa chahie
 This should not be decided on a regional basis
 iske khatarnaak parinaam honge or yah desh ko vibhajit bhi kar saktaa he 
 Expressing disappointment over the delay in disposal of mercy petitions, he blamed the government for this
 jaanch ke dauraan ke samay ko yaad karte hue unhone kaha, mujhe littey se zyada pareshaani kai hiprophile netaaon ke kaaran ai
 They were trying to derail the investigation to fulfill their political objectives
 vah mere liye maansik vednaa thi
 You made up your mind to workout and go to the gym
 lekin vahaan workout ke saath saath aapaki najar takaraa gai saamne workout karti ladki se
 But just a little bit, the girl doing the workouts in the gym is not as fragile as the village blonde
 agar use aapaki koi baat pasand nahin ai, to aapako lene ke dene pad sakate hai
 But don't worry, only her workout can tell how fit she is for you and whether you should talk to her or not
 agar unhen he yoga se lagaavaun ke workout par dhyaan den, agar unhen yoga pasand hai, vah nae nae yoga asana aajamaane kii shaukeen hai
 And you often see them taking or giving yoga classes
 to vah ek phool kii tarah najuk hai, matlab agar aap kabhi unase judte hai, to vah aapke netritv main rahanaa zyada pasand karengi
 But it also means that she can become apathetic very quickly
 isliye jaraa sanbhal kar
 If she does not hurry, she stays in a hurry during workouts and leaves the gym quickly
 chaahe kitni hi jyaaya eksrasij hon vah zyada se zyada 45 minute main sab nibata kar gym chod kar chal detii hai
 So he is very diligent
 apane kaam main nipurn hone ke saath hi vah sakasham mahilaon kii ksheni aati hai
 You can fill that diligence in your life, but care a little
 ho saktaa he ki vah yahi jaldbaaji apane bistar par bhi dikhaaen
 So, understand that for five minutes, you have a relationship in ten minutes and then a long rest
 vah hai multitasoregim main jis mahila par aapaki nadaan najar ja kar ataki he, vah kabhi aapaki ore dekhati hi nahin
 Because either she watches TV during workouts, reads books or something like that
 to janaab aapane ek multitaskar ko pasand kiya he
 His mind seeks a new thing all the time, even if he is busy in some work at that time
 aisi mahila ke saath aap nirvaah to kar sakate hai, par dhyaan rahe ki unke liye har kaam kaa ek nirdhaarit samay hoga
 Not talkative, she often disappears from the gym with her friends at lunch time, she enjoys talking and loves those who listen carefully to her during workouts
 to vah behad batooni kism kii hai
 Their lifestyle is dependent on others
 un ke saath jivan kii patari tab tak hi sahi chalegi, jab tak vah aap main ruchi rakhti hai
 Long-time partner, the woman you have liked
 Does she come for the morning walk on the same path and place, then understand that discipline matters a lot in her life
 vah ek acchhee jeevanasathi sabit ho sakati hai

 American political economist Henry George, in his famous book Protection for Free Trade, published in 1886, made the most convincing and brilliant argument in favor of free trade
 jab unhone yah kitaab likhi thi tab pehle vaishvikaran kii lahar chal padi thi, duniya main vyapaar nitiyaan udaar ho rahi thim
 Nevertheless, his own country remained a symbol of protectionism
 jaahir he, jorge ke nishane par us daur ke sangrakshanvaadiyon kii ek-ek daleel thi
 In that book, George says, protection means stopping and protecting
 is tarah tarriff videshi vastuon ko hamaare desh main aane se rokte hai
 But unlike natural actions such as floods, earthquakes or hurricanes, the flow of goods is the result of the movements of men
 jorge poochhate hai, ve log koun hai jinaki vajah se vastuon kaa pravaah hota he?jawaab beshak videshi vikreta ho sakate hai
 However, George argues that this is a hoax because the seller does not sell his products if our people do not show interest in buying
 isliye, hamaare logon ke kaaran hi videshi vastuon kaa pravaah hota he
 Protectionism prevents "protectors" from what they want; that is, protection against the will of their people, not against foreigners
 jorge ne jis daur main yah likhaa tha us samay zyaadaatar upniveshon main mukt vyapaar chal rahaa tha
 It was not the will of the colonies, but the colonial forces promoted it for their own benefit
 haalanki yuddh ke dauraan upniveshon ko jab apni khud kii vyapaar nitiyaan tay karne kii baari ai to unhone sangrakshan kii niti apana lee
 Later, when the colonies gained political independence after World War II, they took a more protectionist stance than before
 bharat bhi isi raah par chalaa
 During the war years, the textile and iron and steel industries were in need of a very protectionist policy and also got it
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan mandi se aayaat licencing ke jariye pehle se bhi kahin adhik sakht aayaat niyantran kii shuruyaat hui
 After independence, when the balance of payments crisis arose in 1958, the country adopted a foreign currency-based budget
 is parivartan ne aisi vyapaar niti kaa maarg prashast kiya jo sangrakshan ke kareeb thi
 People who remember the period from the 1960s to the 1980s will tell how difficult life was then
 tab koi upabhokta saamaan aayaat nahin kiya ja saktaa tha or kachche maal or mashinari ke aayaat ke liye bhi utpaadakon ko lalaphitaashahee se jujhna padataa tha
 Indian producers gained partial independence in 1991
 sarkaar ne kachche maal or mashinari par aayaat license hataane kaa faisla kiya
 But he enjoyed complete independence only when the government reduced the tariffs to a great extent

 Due to other reforms with liberalization in trade, India did not see an increase in per capita income during the first 17 years of the 21st century, as it did in the entire 20th century
 2017-18 main 2
 With a gross domestic product (GDP) of $ 6 trillion, India is now the sixth largest economy in the world
 agle 10 varshon main ham america or china ke baad khadey honge or vishwa kii teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha ho jaaenge
 That is, the glorious days of the British Raj are about to come when India and China alone contributed more than half of the global economy
 is lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye nirantar aarthik sudhaar or khulepan ke prati patibaddhta kii darkaar hogi
 Today, our imports have been over 20 per cent of GDP, India's bureaucracy is again showing protectionist tendencies to curb imports
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main jorge ne america ke sandarbh main jo baaten kahin thim, vah aaj bharat par lagu hoti hai
 An argument is made for protectionist efforts that our industry is in its infancy
 jorge ne apane daur ke america se aisi daleelon ke khilaaf dridhtaa se khadey hone kaa aagrah kiya tha
 He argued, "the experience so far suggests that once we move towards protectionism, this policy of encouragement leads to destruction rather than strengthening
 isse majbootee nahin, kamajori aati he
 In fact, the "infant industries" that run in government incentives have no chance of gaining strength while struggling
 iskaa nateeja hoga ki anubhav ke abhaav ve aage chalakar bazaar kii ore se milane vaali badi chunautiyon ke aage samarpan kar denge
 "george argued that once the habit of conservation is in place, then the" infant industry "never grows up and without protection it is neither able to stand nor survive
 jorge ne apane deshavaasiyon ko yaad dilaayaa ki america ke praarambhik dinon main jin udyogon ko "shishuon'' kii tarah sangrakshan diya gaya tha, ve abhi bhi khud ko shishav kaal main hi hone kaa daawa karte hue sangrakshan khoj rahe hai
 The time when those industries were given patronage "the infant boys and girls of that time matured and then became elderly men and women, and some even left the world after living their entire lives
 '' ye "shishu udyog'' bhi bade paimaane par ubhare hai, lekin ve "baby act'' ke laabh chhodane ko raji nahin hai
 
 
 From George's point of view, the auto industry of our country will look exactly the same as the infant industry which has been protected from foreign competition since independence and is enjoying prohibitive tariffs till date
 aaj bharat ke saamne ek sawaal khadaa he ki kya bharat ko bhi america dwaara ispaat or aluminium par lagaae gaye haalia tarriff ke khilaaf pratishodhatmak karrwai kerani chahie
 George recommends avoiding the "eye for an eye" approach to trade policy
 sanyog se, unhone iske liye jo tark die the usamen loha udyog ke liye yues tarriff kaa hi udhaaharan diya tha
 He argued that this tariff has hit America more than any other trading partner like Britain
 america ke ucch tarriff se britain ko america main niryaat kii mad main jo nuksaan hua, uski bharpai usne anya deshon main apane lohe ke niryaat ko badhaakar kar lee
 But "the US increased the import duty on iron and iron ore, which increased the cost of American products and helped the UK to expand its trade in the world because American products were more expensive than British products and thus we gave our nearest competitor Instead of causing harm, he only benefited
 hamane dakshin america or anya deshon kaa apana vyapaar unhen saunp diya jahaan hamaari pahunch or hamaara hissaa unase kahin bada ho saktaa tha
 "I see only one situation in which i can support a retaliatory tariff by India as it can advance its national interest provided India persuades the US to withdraw its tariff in due course
" agar aisa nahin hota to shuruaati taur par beshak ham america kii is jang main use bhi choti chot pahunchaa den lekin lambey samay main hamen bada nuksaan hoga
 It would have been possible to force the US to withdraw its tariffs with retaliatory action if all the major exporters of steel and aluminum had retaliated against it
 lekin europea sangh or canada tarriff main chhot maangane ke liye america ke paas daudte hue pahunche hai
 Therefore its probability is negligible
 isliye hamaare phaayde main to yahi rahegaa he ki ham pratishodhatmak karrwai ke badale america se un kshetron main zyada phydemand riyaayaten maangen jisamen vah aasaani se de saktaa he or jo uske liye bhi acha sauda hoga

 The case is of LBF Road in Mavalli area of bengaluru
 ravivaar raat ek dost ne jab duusare ko gale lagane se manaa kiya to usne chaaku markar use ghayal kar diya

 Mamata Banerjee was the first person to defend the four million people who have been hanged in the wake of the National Citizenship Register (NRC) prepared in the neighboring state of Assam on the orders of the Supreme Court
 30 july ko aankadon ke jari hone ke kuch minute baad hi press conference main pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya, ''yah bengaaliyon or bihariyon ko bedakhal karne kii sajeesh he, jinke naam unke upnaam ke aadhaar par hataae gaye hai
 He accused the bjp-led government of Assam of deliberately targeting Muslims
 mamata banerjee ne ek kadam aage jate hue enarasi ke masaude se baahar hue 40 lakh logon ko apane rajya main sharan lene kaa nyauta de daalaa
 Sensing such sharp accusations, state BJP President Dilip Ghosh demanded the same exercise in Bengal through counter-demonstrations
 rajya main dedh karod avaidh bangladeshiyon ke hone kaa daawa karte hue unhone chetavanee di, shshsatta mal aane par ham, bengal main bhi alag se enarasi taiyaar karenge or avaidh apravasiyon ko desh se baahar khaded denge
 BJP national president Amit Shah accused the entire opposition, including Banerjee, of doing vote bank politics at the cost of national security
 shah ne 31 july ko kaha, ''bhaajapa or bijd ko chhodkar ek bhi party ne saamne aakar yah nahin kaha ki avaidh bangladeshi apravasiyon kii desh main koi jagah nahin he
 
 
 And all this is to save vote bank politics
 ''sattarudh trinmul congress or bhaajapa ke bich chal rahi tikhi takaraar kaa koi ant nahin he
 On 31 July, all parties except the saffron group in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed a resolution criticizing the NRC
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki agle loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko phayda pahunchane ke makasad se ise laayaa gaya he
 Mamta even threatened to spark a civil war on the roads
 is bich, assam kii sarkaar ne do agast ko enarasi se baahar rah gaye 'peediton' se milane ja rahe trinmul congress ke saansadon or mantriyon ke ek pratinidhimandal ko rajya main pravesh karne se roak diya
 Analysts say that if the BJP is hoping to polarize Hindu votes in Bengal using the NRC, then the counter strategy of the Trinamool Congress is to use it to secure the vote bank of 30 per cent of the Muslims in the state
 rabindra bharti uniwarsity ke raajnneetik vigyaani vishwanath chakravarti kehete hai ki bhaajapa jahaan enarasi ke jariye sampradayik khel khel rahi he, vahiin mamata bhi is kadam ko bangla bolne vaale logon par hamalaa bataakar bhashaayi bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane ke prayaas main hai
 They say that Bengalis are largely secular and oppose the hindu-muslim divide
 assam ke bengaaliyon ke saath bihari pravaasiyon ko jodakar mukhyamantri bengal ke hindi bhashi bihari matadaataaon ko rijhaanaa chaahati hai
 But the BJP is looking at increasing its vote share in the state in view of increasing resentment among Hindus by the Trinamool Congress's policies of Muslim appeasement
 ghosh kehete hai, ''isiilie mamata ramanavami or janmashtami manaa rahi hai or raajnneetik reliyon main hindu mantron kaa uccharan kar rahi hai
 He is afraid of the Hindu awakening happening in Bengal
 ''rajya main bhagava netritv ne pehle hi yah aarope lagaate hue abhiyaan ched diya he ki avaidh (muslim) bangladeshi apravasi bengal kii arthvyavastha ko hajam kar rahe hai or sthaneey (hindu) yuvaaon kii naukariyaan hadap rahe hai
 Referring to the peak of unemployment in the state, Ghosh says, "we will link unemployment to the issue of illegal immigrants
" '' shah 11 agast ko bengal aa rahe hai, jahaan ve is mudde par sthaneey netaaon ke saath samanvay karenge
 BJP leaders are keeping forward the figures of the time of National Front and UPA Governments
 1991 main tatkaaleen grih mantri indrajit gupt ne kaha tha ki bharat main ek karod bangladeshi rah rahe hai
 Later during the tenure of UPA-I, Minister of State for Home Shriprakash Jaiswal told Parliament that this figure 1
 2 karod he
 Analysts say that these figures add weight to the bjp's claim that now 1 in West Bengal alone
 5 karod avaidh bangladeshi hai
 On this issue, the Trinamool Congress is also disrupting the proceedings of the Lok Sabha, while Mamata herself had lashed out at the Left Front government in Bengal accusing the Bangladeshi immigrants of creating vote banks
 bhaajapa ke netaa kehete hai ki enarasi sampradayik dhruvikaran ke bajaae vaastavik nagarikon kii pahchaan karne main or avaidh videshiyon ko baahar karne main madad karegaa
 At the same time, the party hopes that the amendment of the Civil Act 1955 will help separate Hindu refugees
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv ram madhav kehete hai, ''jo log utpeedit hokar bharat aae hai, unke prati hamaari jimmedaari he
 They are our own people
 ''lekin aarope-pratyarope ke is khel ke pehle daur main mamata ne antarrashtriya seemaa se sate bengal ke chah jilon main maujuud 68 lakh kii aabaadi vaale anusuchit jati matua ke sharnaarthiyon kaa samarthan juta kar badhat bana lee he
 The community has been angered by the viral photographs of the incident of Assam policemen scrambling with Matua MP Mamta Bala Thakur (she was also among the Trinamool leaders trying to enter Assam)
 naaraaz pradarshnakariyon ne assam ke enarasi main paanch lakh matua ke naam shaamil nahin kiye jane kaa bhi virodh kiya he
 Leaders of the Trinamool Congress claim that the community seemed to be leaning towards the BJP till recently when they were promised to pacify their issue through the Citizenship Act, but recent developments forcefully brought them closer to Mamata Have given

 # Smog # indvsl In a tweet to Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh Mangalwar, the media has been mired in controversies, calling them 'presstitutes'
 raajnneetik dal unke is baat par unki khinchaai kar rahe hai
 Friends what do you expect from presstitutes
 Last time Arnab thought there was 'O' in place of 'E' # timesnowdisaster‚Äî Vijay Kumar Singh (@gen_vksingh)april 7, 2015singh yaman main fanse bharatiyon ko nikaalane ke liye chal rahe oparation par najar rakh rahe hai
 He made this statement after the press conference in Djibouti
 congress ne wike singh ke is bayaan kii ninda kii or unhen asamvedansheel kaha
 Other parties also regretted this statement
 singh in dinon jibooti main hai or bharatiyon ko bachaane kaa oparation dekh rahe hai
 Singh, in his tweet, targeted such media institutions and was attacking them for attending Jopakistan Day
 aapako bataa den ki march 2015 main pakistan diwas par wike singh pakistan duutavas main yojit kaarykram main pahunche the
 The controversy had started since then and his attitude became a problem for the Modi government
 yahi nahin, unhone ise lekar twitor par kai twit bhi kiye the or ise ek duty bataaya tha
 However, VK Singh also tried to give clarification in front of the media as the matter progressed

 The girl was later recovered
 donon ladke bhi gaanv waalon kii pakad main aa gaye
 After this the Khap Panchayat was informed about this incident
 khap panchayatki baithak bulaai gai
 And both the young men were given this dreadful punishment
 jab un yuvakon ke saath yah atyaachaar ho rahaa tha, tab kuch log mobile se iskaa video shoot kar rahe the, jo baad main soshal media par viral ho gaya
 The Khap Panchayat left the two youths on the condition that they would not go to the police and report what happened to them
 saath hi is tarah kii harakat kabhi dobaaraa nahin karenge
 Due to fear of Khap Panchayat, the families of both the youths are coming forward and saying nothing

 bhartiya swadhinata sangram ke 'mahanayake' kahe jane vaale netaji subhaashachandr bose ke bare main chhaae rahasy se 67 saal baad bhi pardaa nahin uth paaya he
 
 
 In 1945, three commissions were set up to ascertain the truth of his death in the alleged plane crash in Taiwan on 18 August, but the truth has not been revealed yet
 
 
 desh ke bahut-se log aaj bhi yah maanate hai ki netaji kii maut vimaan haadase main nahin hui thi or vah azaadi ke baad bhi lambe samay tak jivit rahe, lekin apni zindagi gumnami main bitaai
 
 
 There are many stories about Netaji
 
 
 kai sadhu-santon ne khud ke netaji hone kaa daawa kiya, jisase yah rahasy gaharaata chalaa gaya
 
 
 The Taiwan government, seeing its record, revealed that there was no plane crash in Taiwan on August 18, 1945, which further strengthened the belief of those who did not believe the story of Netaji's death that this great freedom fighter was British Was still alive after liberation
 
 
 subhaashachandr bose ke rahasy par pustaken likh chuke 'mishan netaji' ke anuj dhar kaa daawa he ki bharat sarkaar sab kuch jaanati he, lekin vah jaan-boojhkar rahasy se pardaa uthaanaa nahin chaahati
 
 
 He said that is why the government refused to provide him with information related to Netaji even on his application filed under Right to Information
 
 
 vaise netaji or unki maut kii kahani kii sachai jaanane ke liye jitani bhi jaanch huin, un sabamein kuch na kuch aisa saamne aayaa, jisase yah kahani or ulajhati chali gai
 
 
 Colonel habib-ur-rehman, who was with Netaji during the alleged plane crash in Taiwan, made contradictory statements before SAI Nair, the information minister of the Azad Hind government, Russian and American spies and the Shahnawaz Committee
 
 
 rahamaan ne kabhi kaha ki unhone netaji ke jalte hue kapade unke badan se alag kiye the to kabhi apane bare main kaha ki vah to vimaan haadase main khud bhi behosh ho gaye the, or jab aankh khuli to khud ko taipei ke ek aspataal main paaya
 
 
 Sometimes he gave the date of Netaji's funeral on August 20, 1945 and sometimes on August 22
 
 
 azaad hind fouj (iene) ke bahut-se sainikon or adhikariyon ne bhi yah kaha ki netaji kii maut kathith vimaan haadase main nahin hui thi
 
 
 To expose the mystery, the inquiry committee formed by the first Prime Minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru's government under the leadership of Shahnawaz Khan, in April 1956, told the incident of the plane crash, but Netaji's elder brother Suresh Chandra Bose remained in the committee
 Denying this report, it was said that an attempt is being made to deliberately tell the truth about the alleged plane crash
 
 
 azaad hind fouj ke vayovruddh senaanee ramsingh kaa maananaa he ki netaji azaadi ke baad bhi bahut dinon tak jivit rahe the or desh kii ghatiya raajnneeti ne unhen kabhi saamne nahin aane diya
 
 
 The comments iske baad july, 1970 main banaae gaye nyaayamurti jidi khosla ayog ne bhi vahi report di, jo shahanvaj samiti ne di thi
 
 
 After this, a third commission, named Mukherjee Commission, was set up in 1999 to investigate Netaji's alleged death
 
 
 isane apni report main vimaan haadase main netaji kii maut ko khaarij kar diya tathaa kaha ki maamle main aage or jaanch kii zarurat he
 
 
 The Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India on 8 November 2005, which was tabled in Parliament on 17 May 2006, but the government refused to accept the report
 
 
 is bich, azaad hind fouj se jude kai log yah daawa kar chuke hai ki uttar pradesh ke faizabad main rahane vaale 'gumnami baba' hi netaji subhaashachandr bose the, or vah gupt rup se netaji se mila karte the
 
 
 Anuj Dhar, in his book 'india's Biggest cover-up', has quoted several confidential documents and photographs claiming that Netaji was alive till 1985
 
 
 desh ke bahut-se log aaj bhi yah maanate hai ki netaji kii maut vimaan haadase main nahin hui thi or vah azaadi ke baad bhi lambe samay tak jivit rahe, lekin apni zindagi gumnami main bitaai

 Anuj Dhar, in his book 'india's Biggest cover-up', has quoted several confidential documents and photographs claiming that Netaji was alive till 1985
 
 
 taiwan sarkaar ne apana record dekhakar khulaasa kiya ki 18 agast, 1945 ko taiwan main koi vimaan haadasa hua hi nahin tha, jisase netaji kii maut kii kahani ko sach na maanane waalon kaa yah vishwaas or majboot ho gaya ki azaadi kaa yah mahanayake bharat kii angrajon se mukti ke baad bhi jivit tha
 
 
 Anuj Dhar of 'mission Netaji', who has written books on the mystery of Subhash Chandra Bose, claims that the Indian government knows everything, but it does not want to deliberately hide the secret
 
 
 unhone kaha ki isiilie sarkaar ne soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat daayar unke aavedan par bhi unhen netaji se judi jaankaree uplabdh karaane se inkaar kar diya
 
 
 By the way, all the investigations that took place to know the truth of Netaji and his death story, something came out in all of them, due to which this story got further complicated
 
 
 taiwan main kathith vimaan haadase ke vakt netaji ke saath rahe karnal habib-ur-rahamaan ne azaad hind sarkaar ke soochna mantri ese naiyar, roosi tathaa america jasuson or shahanvaj samiti ke samaksh virodhabhasi bayaan die
 
 
 Rahman said that he had taken away Netaji's burning clothes from his body, sometimes said about himself that he had fainted himself in the plane crash, and found himself in a hospital in Taipei when his eyes opened

 To expose the mystery, the inquiry committee formed by the first Prime Minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru's government under the leadership of Shahnawaz Khan, in April 1956, told the incident of the plane crash, but Netaji's elder brother Suresh Chandra Bose remained in the committee
 Denying this report, it was said that an attempt is being made to deliberately tell the truth about the alleged plane crash

 gujarat ke maujuuda siyaasi halaat ko dekhte hue lagane laga he ki patidaaron ke sir se hardik patel kaa jaadu utarane laga he
 Two years ago, on the orders of Hardik, the Patel community of the state was ready to give up its life, but political chess has become such a thing that today the same Patel community is trying to distance itself from Hardik Patel
 do saal pehle bijepi ke khilaaf baghawat kaa jhanda uthaane vaale hardik ke saathiyon ke dil main camel khil rahaa he or wo ek-ek karke bijepi kaa daaman tham rahe hai
 Hardik is slowly falling alone in the political battlefield of Gujarat
 unke akelepan kaa ye dard ab unke twit se bhi jhalkane laga he
 Hardik tweeted on Monday afternoon
 
 
 aaj bazpeiji kii do pankti yaad aa gai,baadhaayen aati he aegi,dhire pralay kii ghor ghate,paanvon ke neeche angaare,sir par barase yadi jwalaaye,nij hatho main hanste hanste,aag lagaakar jalanaa hoga,qadam milakar chalanaa hoga 
 
 ‚Äî Hardik Patel (@hardikpatel_)november 20, 2017siyasat kii rangath main naa duubo itnaa,ki veeron kii shahadat bhi najar naa aae,jaraa sa yaad kar lo apane vaayade jubaan ko,gar tumhe apni jubaan kaa kaha yaad aae
 Hardik Patel did not stop after this tweet, he also expressed his pain through the lines written by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpai
 unhone twit kiya-baadhaaen aati hai aegi, ghire pralay kii ghor gata, paanvon ke neeche angaare, sir par barase yadi jwaalaayein,nij haathon main hansate hansate, aag lagaakar jalanaa hoga, qadam milakar chalanaa hoga
 Please tell that through Patel reservation movement, Hardik Patel got a new identity not only in the state but in the country
 hardik patel ne andolan ke jariye gujarat kii tasviir ko badal kar rakh diya tha
 Hardik Patel rallied at the GMDC Ground in Ahmedabad on 25 August 2015
 is raily main 5 lakh se zyada logon kii bheed hardik ke farmaan par sadakon par utar ai thi
 Many Patel youths were also killed in the violence that followed this movement
 gujarat main patel samudaay kareeb 16 fisadi he
 One who has the power to create and destroy power
 rajya kii 182 vidhansabha siton main se 70 siton par patel samudaay kaa prabhaav he
 The Patel community of the state has been a traditional voter of the BJP for the last two decades, but now it is angry
 isi kaa nateeja rahaa ki 2015 main hue jila panchayat chunaav main patidaar bahulya ilaake main congress vijayi rahi or bijepi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Hardik's apology was so great that the heads of the youth of the Patel community were speaking up, saying that Deputy CM Nitin Patel had also faced resentment during the bjp's Gaurav Yatra in Gujarat
 iske alaava aarakshan andolan ke dauraan gujarat main bijepi kii raily ke manch par lohe kii jaali lagaani padi thi taaki amit shah ko kisi bhi sambhavit hamale se bachaaya ja sake
 Time changed and politics took such a turn that the leaders of the Patel community, who took a rebellious stand against the BJP, have started coming to BJP again
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul bajte hi bijepi ne patel samudaay kii naaraazgi dur karne ke jatan main lag gai
 During this, pornographic cds of Hardik Patel were also released, which weakened his image
 bijepi hardik ke saathiyon ko todakar apane saath milaane lagi
 Hardik's associates of the reservation movement are joining the BJP one by one
 inamen reshma patel, chiraag patel kethan patel, amrish va shweta patel jaise yuva netaa shaamil hai
 Jai Prakash Pradhan, associate professor at Gujarat Central University, says that the resentment of the Patel community has been overcome to a great extent by the BJP
 wo 2015 main jis tarah se naaraaz the ab vaise nahin hai
 This is the reason why many of Hardik's associates have joined BJP
 patel samudaay bijepi kaa paramparaagat vot he, congress ke saath vah bahut zyada set nahin ho saktaa he
 Hardik started to embrace the Congress to defeat the BJP in the Gujarat Assembly elections
 is kadi main unhone congress ke saamne aarakshan sahit kai shart rakhi, jis par kai round kii meeting ke baad thodi sahmati bani
 But soon after the first list of the Congress, the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti has raised the flag of revolt against the Congress
 somvaar ko gujarat ke kai sthanon par congress or patidaar samudaay ke bich jhadpen huin
 Seeing this, Hardik Patel has canceled his rally in Surat

 Market share of profits purv senapramukh general wike singh ne mangalvaar ko apane pehle die bayaan par safai dete hue kaha he ki jammu evam kashmir ke mantriyon ko rishwat die jane kii baat galat he
 Earlier, there were reports that the former army chief claimed that the army had been giving money to the ministers of the state, as they had to work with the ministers to maintain stability in the state
 purv general ne khufia unit kii report li ho jane kii jaanch karaane kii bhi maang kii or kaha ki khufia unit or uski reporton ke bare main sawarjanik rup se baat karnaa deshadroh he
 The way the report has been exposed, General Singh has also feared intrigue behind it
 purv thal senapramukh wike singh ne kaha ki yah kahana saraasar galat he ki kisi mantri ko rishwat di gai
 This money was given to those people to win the hearts of the people, and this was done with the aim of helping the state government
 general singh ne kaha ki darasal, sena kii vah sikret unit rajya kii pruthakatavaadi takaton ke khilaaf kaam karti he
 He also said that that intelligence unit worked under DGMI, not his
 jis tarah se khufia ikai kii report ujagar hui, uske peeche general singh ne sajeesh kii ashanka jataate hue kaha ki isamen desh kii chhavi kaa khyaal nahin rakhaa gaya, yah deshadroh he
 Prior to this, politics was heated up after the statement of the army chief before the ministers of Jammu and Kashmir got money from the army
 unke bayaan par grahamantri susheel scindia ne kaha tha ki wike singh raajnneetigyon ke naam bataaen
 If details are given then we can investigate
 darasal, wike singh ne ek angreji akhbaar ko die bayaan main kaha tha ki sena jammu‚àíkashmir main sabhi mantriyon ko rakam detii he
 General Singh had said that the army does this to maintain stability in the state
 unhone kaha ki mantriyon ko kai chijen karne ke saath hi kai gatividhiyon ko bhi anjaam dena hota he
 In fact, the general gave this statement in response to the allegations leveled against him
 un par aarope he ki apane kaarykaal main jammu‚àíkashmir ke mantri gulam hasan mir ko rajya sarkaar ko asthir karne ke liye technical saport divijan kii ore se ek karod 19 lakh rupee die gaye the
 However, after this statement, VK Singh said that maybe not all ministers, but there are some ministers and people, who are given money to do special work
 is bayaan par neshnal conference ke adhyaksh faruk abdulla kaa kahana he ki wike singh kaa bayaan durbhagyapurna he or isaki jaanch honi chahie
 He also said that the army cannot fund any party and if this has happened then it is wrong
 faruk abdulla ne kaha ki ab is maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karai jaani chahie, taaki pataa chal sake ki kisne paise liye hai, or us rakam kaa kis tarah istemaal kiya gaya he
 On the other hand, State President of National Conference Devender Singh Rana said that it is sad and unfortunate for the country and especially the army that the former army chief is making such baseless statements
 vahiin jammu-kashmir ke mantri taj mohiuddeen kaa kahana he ki agar wike singh ke paas mantriyon ke naam hai to vah khulaasa karen
 bjp's Subramanian Swamy has defended General Singh on the issue, while Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh has said that General Singh should have said this only when he was the army chief
 NCP sarkaar main bhi dipti siem hi banate ajitkya ab bhi unki vishwasaneeyata rahegi kaayamamaharashtra kaa siyaasi jhagada supreme court kii dahalij tak pahunch chukaa he jis par court ab somvaar ko faisla suna sakati he
 There was an uproar in Maharashtra politics on Saturday when Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and party chief Sharad Pawar, appeared on TV screens swearing in as deputy CM along with Devendra Fadnavis
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 24 oktober ko aa gaye the
 Since then the debate on the formation of the government was going on and all kinds of speculations were being made about it, but no one was aware of this and no one would have thought that any leader of NCP would go with BJP, Deputy CM Will take the oath of office
 haalanki maharashtra kii siyasat kii bisaat par ajit pavaar ne ek aisi chaal chali jisane sabhi ko chaunkaa diya

 But despite this, the Pawar family is trying to somehow convince Ajit Pawar and bring him back to the NCP camp
 sharad pavaar or supriya sule ne ravivaar ko ajit pavaar ke bhai shrinivas se bhi baat kii thi
 It is well known that Ajit Pawar has already been very vocal within the NCP, but the question is that when the NCP was trying to form a government with Congress and Shiv Sena, then why did Ajit Pawar suddenly take such a step? Also read- Maharashtra politics at decisive point, these 11 small parties will also remain important in government formation, Ajit sitting on the wrong foot? After separating from Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, BJP has given its The government raised hand making the Shiv Sena has begun the process of forming a government with the NCP and Congress

 Ajit Pawar was chosen as the leader of the NCP Legislature Party and the letter supporting Uddhav Thackeray was also signed by him, which Ajit Pawar used to form the government with Devendra Fadnavis
 baharhaal mana ja rahaa tha ki sarkaar main portpholio ko lekar bhi faisle ho chuke the
 It was also believed that if the Shiv sena-ncp and Congress formed the government, Ajit Pawar would have become the deputy CM
 ajit pavaar ke is ek kadam kii vajah se ensipi or pavaar parivaar main daraar saamne aa gai
 However, sources are quoting that an attempt is being made to convince Ajit Pawar
 agar wo bijepi ke saath nahin jate, shivasena-ensipi or congress kii sarkaar banati to usamen bhi ajit pavaar dipti siem hi banate
 But now even if they agree and they return home, will the NCP be able to trust them as before? prince harry bhale hi america ke purv raashtrapati baraak obama or unki patni mishael obama ko apana dost maanate hon lekin aisa lag rahaa he ki vah apni shaadi main unhen aamantrit nahin kar paaenge
 On May 19 this year, Prince Harry and Megan Merkel are to be married
 prince harry apane radio sho ke liye purv raashtrapati baraak obama kaa intervyuu bhi le chuke hai
 But still he will not be able to invite Barack Obama to attend this special moment because it can make US President Donald Trump feel humiliated

 Talking about the lack of special delicacies of Bihar in trains opening from Bihar, now things are going to happen in the old days
 in trainon main yatri ab bihar ke khaas vyanjanon kaa mazaa uthaa sakenge
 The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has planned to provide locally popular food and snacks to all the long-distance trains from Bihar
 yahi nahin, ab pentry car ke waiter bhi 'good morning' or 'helo-hai' kahkar aapkaa abhivadan karenge
 a railway official said that the IRCTC has decided to provide Chuda-curd for breakfast in the trains opening from North Bihar, while litti-chokha and non-vegetarian in trains passing through Central Bihar and South Bihar region Rustic chicken will also be made available in the mines
 IRCTC ke kshetreey prabandhak rajesh kumaar ne bataaya ki bihari vyanjanon kii branding karne ke liye trainon main yahaan ke mashhoor vyanjanon ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the list has been sent to the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM) by the Regional Headquarters at Kolkata of IRCTC, which has sent to Patna Office
 IHM in vyanjanon ko khaas tareeke se yatriyon ko parosane ko lekar study kar rahaa he
 He told that in South Indian trains, local delicacies are also served to the passengers in Idli, Dosa and trains opening from Western India
 kumaar kehete hai, "bihar ke darbhanga, mujffarpur sahit uttar bihar ke steshnon se khulne vaali trainon main yatriyon ke liye chuda-dahi kaa vikalp hoga
 Travelers will also be able to taste litti-chokha and ghughni
 yatri litti ke saath dehati chiken, dalpudi ke saath sabji, chuda or mung ghughni, sattu paratha ke saath dahi or achaar kaa bhi aannad le sakenge
 "he told that there would be an option of curd and papad with khichdi on Saturday
 kumaar ne kaha ki yatriyon kii yah shikaayat rahati thi ki ghar jaise khaane (sthaneey) trainon main uplabdh nahin hote
 This scheme has been prepared by the Railways to address this complaint of the passengers
 idhar, yatri bhi railway kii is yojana se khush hai
 irctc's Regional Manager Rajesh says that special care is being taken to provide better catering facilities to passengers in trains
 ab pentrikaron ke vendoron or wetaron ko bhi prashikshit kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that there were frequent complaints of quarreling with passengers due to the painter's vendors and waiters not being trained in their work
 yatriyon kii in shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye ab vendoron or wetaron ko prashikshit kiya jayega
 He told that an institution of Danapur will train these waiters and then they will be posted in the pantrymen operated by IRCTC
 isse trainon main yatriyon ko na keval behatar maahaul mil sakegaa, balki yatri yatra kaa majaa bhi uthaa sakenge
 Resignation of Chief Minister at six o'clock in the evening and oath of CM again at 10 o'clock
 nitish kumaar ne mahaj 16 ghante main pehle istife or phir shapath lekar jo record banaaya he vaisaa udhaaharan bhartiya raajnneeti main doosraa nahin dikhataa
 The political developments in Bihar have raised the question that if Nitish had to join hands with BJP by breaking ties with JDU, then why did he resign himself when he had an easier option to sack Tejashwi Yadav? Actually there is a big political message hidden behind this too
 nitish argedy ko peedit banane kaa mauka dene ke bajaay khud ko tyaagi dikhaanaa zyada phaayde kaa sauda samajhate the, isiilie unhone sabko chaunkaate hue apane istife kaa daanv chalaa
 Tejashwi's resignation or sacking was waiting
 When JDU and Nitish took a tough stand on Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav surrounded by allegations of corruption, it was clear that either Tejashwi Yadav will resign himself or Nitish will sack him
 buudhvaar kii shaam ko jab jediu ne apane vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaai tab sabko isi khabar kaa intjaar tha ki nitish ne tejasvi ko barkhaast kar diya
 But to his surprise, Nitish himself resigned from his post
 nitish chaahate to bina istipha die bhi batch jaati sarkarrajnneetik jaankaron ke mutabik nitish jab argedy se alag hone kaa faisla kar chuke the to unke saamne do vikalp the yaa to wo tejasvi ko barkhaast karte yaa phir khud istipha dete
 In both cases, he would get the support of the BJP and the government would remain
 tejasvi kii barkhaastagi ke baad argedy agar samarthan waapas leti to sadan main bijepi kaa samarthan hasil kar nitish vishwaas mat hasil kar sakate the
 In such a situation, he would neither have to resign nor be sworn in again but despite this he chose the second option as it had two political advantages
 tejasvi ko nahin diya victim banane kaa maukanithish ne tejasvi ko barkhaast kar unhen victim banane kaa mauka nahin diya
 Because of this, the stunning state could gain sympathy and his political stature could also increase
 lalu yadav or unke parivaar ko bhi jab nitish ke is mudde par ade rahane kaa ahsaas ho gaya to unhone bhi tejasvi se istipha na dilwane kii baat kahi taaki majabuuran nitish ko unhen barkhaast karnaa pade or argedy iskaa raajnneetik phayda uthaa paae lekin nitish ne apane daanv se lalu ko hairaan kar diya
 Instead of dismissing Kadatjesvi, Nitish increased his reach when he himself reached Raj Bhavan to resign, he was able to deliver a big political message that he would not compromise corruption even if he had to leave his chair
 nitish ne rajbhavan ke baahar aakar jo bayaan diya wo bhi unke raajnneetik agenda ke bare main bahut kuch kah jaataa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself did the right thing in which he congratulated Nitish for his resignation

 Chhath Puja is the biggest festival of worship of Lord Surya
 chhath puja main ugte surya or duubate surya ko arghya diya jaataa he
 If to please the Sun God and to get the desired results one should chant some mantras
 surya ko 'sarvati sakshi bhootam' (sab kuch dekhne vaala) kaha gaya he
 It is said that the Sun God is the witness of every activity and the people become angry with those who do not worship the sun
 isliye surya bhagwaan ko vaise to kisi kii madad karke yaa shubh karmon ke dwaara bhi prasann kiya ja saktaa he lekin agar upasna karte vakt in mantron kaa jaap kiya jaae to manovanchit fal praapt hote hai
 Chanting Surya Mantra is very easy
 iskaa jaap karne kaa sabase sahi samay suryoday he
 These mantras can be chanted with different 12 postures
 uun mitray nam:uun ravaye nam:uun suryaay nam:uun bhaanve nam:uun pushne nam:uun marichaaye nam:uun adityay nam:uun bhashkaraay nam:uun arqy nam:uun khagaye nam:kai vrath-tyohaar bhagwaan surya ko samarpit hai
 Lord Surya is worshiped in Makar Sankranti, Rath Saptami, Chhath and Samba Dashami
 surya mantra ke labhbhagwan surya ko aatma kaa hissaa mana jaataa he
 Offering arghya while chanting the sun mantra is also auspicious
 isse swasthya laabh bhi hota he
 Chanting the Surya Mantra on a regular basis brings energy into the body
 
 The Sun God should offer Arghya 7 times while chanting
 agar aap or zyada shubh fal kii prapti chaahate hai to aapako laal rang ke vastra dhaaran karne chahie
 What the Rigveda says According to the Rigveda, all the tasks of a person who is up at sunrise are completed
 brahmad ke sabhi jeev or chijen surya par ashrith hai
 The Sun removes all physical, mental and spiritual disorders
 surya ke 7 rangon kaa khaas mahatv he
 Chanting Surya Mantra helps in getting the energy of these colors
 surya mantra ke jaap se buddhi badhaane main bhi madad milti he
 How to give arghya Fill water in copper vessel, add red sandalwood, kumkum and red colored flowers in it
 suryoday ke samay purv kii disha main munh karke arghya den
 It would be better if you offer water to the root of a plant while offering arghya to the sun

 Perhaps one reason has been that all the decisions have been made by asking Sheela Jung Saheb! If not, there must have been a conflict at some time, i have not met Google Baba, if you have met, then definitely
 dilli jaisi aaj he, jamaane se waisi he
 So why is this 'war new'? Are the roles of Modi government and PMO as innocent and constitutional as BJP spokespersons in this? Or BJP is busy in the master plan to imprison Kejriwal in the government cage! If this is the case, then believe him, he is not hitting the ax in his own foot, but putting the foot in the saw machine from where no foot comes back
 is desh ne rajnatik matbhedon se bhare khub jamaane dekhe hai
 Here at the Center and in the States, different governments have spent a long time cursing each other, but we have never seen the political drama of such an obstacle in the maintenance of their daily work and responsibilities

 kya modi hamaari sanvaidhanik or saamaanya rajnatik maryaada or paramparaon ko khatre ke nishaan se upar tak le aae hai
 The matter has started focusing on PM Modi, because the PMO seems to be the center of this 'delhi Ki Jang'

 yahaan tak ki videshon main bhi congress ko koste rahete hai
 Yes, you are healed, as Manmohan Singh, who has never spoken, said that you are a superhit speaker, whose promises were public, but now she wants (there is also Delhi) her tears between foreign policy and there Jaighosh There should also be mention and resolution of issues
 dilli kii sarkaar ko kaam karne dena or usamen alji rupi rukaawat ko dur karnaa aisa hi kaam he

 The public wanted to make you sit in Delhi, so it did, but whatever they have done, if they do not work and will count your name, then it may have to be paid in the next two biggest wars
 haa, ek baat or
 You will agree with Kejriwal that the battle of elections is not to be fought, so let the Kejriwal government work and ask your party to prepare for the war of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 dilli ko kejariwal ko saunp den, kyonki yahi janadesh he
 The comments is jang ke bich mujhe 'badlapur' kii yaad aa rahi he
 BJP should keep Varun Dhawan's 'badlapur' show early for its leaders (especially active in Delhi)
 yah film bahut hi samvedansheeltaa se yah samajhaati he ki aapkaa badla kitna hi jaruri or pavitra kyon na ho, usase aapako bhi utana hi nuksaan hota he
 Therefore, the sooner the BJP and Modi government come out of this Badlapur mode, leaving Delhi at Kejriwal's discretion, the better it will be for him and Delhi
 varanaa 'jang' kii keemat sabko chukaani padegi
 These days Delhi and the country are used to seeing less of the 'war level' which is going on between Kejriwal government and LG
 yahaan tak ki 2014 ke mahachunavi baras or modi-rahul reliyon ke dinon main bhi vaisaa 'romaanch or ection' dekhne ko nahin miltaa tha
 In Sheila Dixit's Raja Yoga, i never saw Najeeb Saheb going towards war
 shaayad ek vajah yah rahi ho ki saare nirnay shila jang sahab se poochkar karti rahi hon! agar nahin to kabhi to koi anban hui hogi, mujhe to google baba se mili nahin, aapako mili to bataaen, jarur
 Delhi is like it is today
 to phir yah 'jang kyon nai' he? kya isamen modi sarkaar or piemo kii bhoomikaayen utani hi maasoom or sanvaidhanik hai, jitani kii bhaajapa ke pravaktaa bataate hai? yaa bijepi kejariwal ko sarkaar ke pinjre main kaid karne ke master plan main vyast he! agar aisa he to yakeen maniye vah khud ke paanv main kulhadi nahin maar rahi he, balki paanv ko aara mashin main daal rahi he, jahaan se koi paanv waapas nahin aata
 This country has seen many times full of political differences
 yahaan centre or rajyon main lambey arse tak alag-alag sarkaron ne apana kaam ek duusare ko koste hue guzaara he, lekin unke dainik kaamon or jimmedaariyon ke nirvaah main aise rode kaa rajnatik naatak hamane kabhi nahin dekha
 i am jealous of the energy of PM Narendra Modi and his mastery of speech in speech
 vah aseem urja or raat din kaam main duube rahane vaale netaa or pradhanmantri hai, jaisaa ki unke twitor acount se hamen samay-samay par pataa chalata he, lekin kya ve abhi tak 'ellection mod' par hai
 Has Modi brought our constitutional and normal political dignity and traditions above the danger mark? baat jang se shuru hokar piem modi par isliye ekagra ho gai he, kyonki piemo is 'dilli kii jang' kaa centre banataa dikh rahaa he
 After all, we know our Prime Minister as a leader who is not spared, does not hide his choice

 Made Amit Shah a pioneer
 kejariwal ko piem modi apni sabase badi chunauti maanate hai
 Kejriwal has harassed them a lot
 yahaan tak kii thali main dikh rahi dilli ek jatke main chin lee

 Letting the Government of Delhi work and removing the obstruction in the form of LG is one such thing
 ham sab chaahate hai ki yah jang jaldi se jaldi khatm ho or yah aapke bina hastkshep ke sambhav nahin
 If Delhi gets the message that your government is stuck due to its work, then its effect can be very negative in the upcoming examinations (elections) of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh

 isliye bhaajapa or modi sarkaar jitani jaldi is badlapur mod se baahar aegi, dilli ko kejariwal ke vivek par chhod degi, utana uske or dilli ke liye behatar hoga

 When Donald Trump was declared Person of the Year by Time magazine, my question was why Trump was awarded the title
 yon shoshan? rangabhed? kattarpanth?mere sawaal kaa jawaab magazine ke cover par saaf-saaf darshaya gaya tha- ek aaleeshaan kursi par virajman trump kaa satta ke shikhar par pahunchnaa apratyaashit tha
 However, in India this year, if a person is seen emerging with luck like Donald Trump, then he is a security guard sitting in a chair outside the ATM across the country
 bhale uski kursi donald trump kii kursi jitani aaleeshaan nahin he
 Before the announcement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement, this man was a symbol of loneliness and immense patience
 machhar, koharaa or kadakadaati sardi is shaks ke kaam ko behad jatil banaati he
 Even the Avara dog on the road does not care about this person in the ATM
 is shaks kii jindagi main mahaj do dhun goonjati he- trephic kaa shorgul or atm main lage asi ke gadgadane kii aawaaj
 The condition of this man is completely native and till 2015 he was not even required to be posted outside the ATM
 haalanki is shaks kaa kaam apaar jimmedaariyon se bharaa he
 Despite this, the person's existence is invisible at the ATM
 atm aate-jate hamaari najar bhi is shaks par nahin padati he
 It is far from thinking whether there is time to eat and drink anything during the day
 vahiin raat ke andhere main to parchhaayi bhi iskaa saath chhod detii he
 The broken chair or pavement outside the ATM becomes its bed
 8 november tak jise sangat naseeb nahin hoti thi uski kismat raaton-raat badal gai
 This invisible person became important by applying demonetisation
 atm aane-jane waalon ko isaki maujuudagi ko ehsaas ho gaya
 Some people started smiling and praying and some people asked for tea and water
 vahiin kabhi-kabhi ye logon ke gusse kaa shikaar bhi banane laga
 Overnight this man became the guard Saheb
 notebandi lagu hone ke baad is shaks kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhane lage
 People started getting their mobile number saved in the guard's mobile so that they could get information as soon as the cash van filled with new fragrant currency came to the ATM
 log guard se isliye bhi sambandh madhur karne lage jisase lambii qatari ke baavjood vah unhen ek se zyada debit card kaa istemaal karne de
 With great humility and a smile, the guard embraced this new power as if it had been with him for a long time
 vah logon ko paise nikaalane main madad karne laga, card ko istemaal karne kaa sahi tarika samajhane laga or pratidin hajaaron baar ek sawaal ''atm chal rahaa he kya" kaa jawaab dene laga
 During this time the entrepreneur inside this man also woke up
 vah anjaan logon se unkadebit card or passwordlene laga jisase raat 12 baje se thik pehle or raat 12 baje ke baad unke liye atm se adhiktam 5000 rupee nikaal sake
 For a mere small commission, he pacified many people's appetite to withdraw this maximum cash in the era of demonetisation
 der raat main bhi is shaks kaa kaam khatm nahin hota he kyonki aate-jate log kisi jombi kii tarah atm par ruk jate hai
 Without being tired or unhappy it would tell people "not walking brother" overnight
 is shaks kii kahani vaaki apratyaashit he or isaki shaktiyon main hue is ijaphe kii kisi ko ummid nahin thi
 However, it is different from Trump because these powers will not stay with it for a long time and soon he will be invisible once again in his broken chair
 lekin jis sanyam ke saath usne in kuch dinon main desh main nai karency ke vitaran main 'president' kii bhoomika adaa kii he isamen koi sandesh nahin he ki vah bharat kaa person of da year he

 # veerediwedding # kareenakapoorkhana post shared by sonamkapoor (@sonamkapoor) on Sep 4, 2017 at 1:55am PDT On November 14, Vice Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University, Rakesh Bhatnagar met the protesting students for the last several days
 darasal yah chaatr vishvavidhyalay ke sanskrit vidya dharm vigyaan sankaay main dow
 Feroze Khan is upset with the appointment as a teacher
 vahaan maujuud ek chaatr ne bataaya, '' vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ke saamne hamane ve saare tathy pesh kiye jinke mutabik sanskrit ke dharm vigyaan sankaay main kisi muslim vyakti kii niyukti nahin kii ja sakati
 The Vice Chancellor saw all the evidence and said, this evidence is based on a person's thinking and a person cannot be above the constitution
 ''chaatro kaa andolan abhi bhi ugr he
 He is sitting on a dharna and is determined not to allow the appointment of a Muslim teacher in Sanskrit Religion Department at any cost
 is andolan main is vibhaag ke maujuuda chaatr-chaatraon ke alaava vishvavidhyalay ke anya vibhaagon ke bhi chaatr-chatraayen shaamil hai
 Not only this, the alumni also failed to sacrifice in the fire of this movement
 vishvavidhyalay ke sanskrit ke dharm vigyaan ke purv chaatr munish mishra bataate hai, ''vishvavidhyalay ke kisi bhi sankaay main kisi bhi dharm ke log padhaa sakate hai, yahaan tak kii sanskrit ke sahitya vibhaag main bhi kisi bhi dharm ke shikshak kii niyukti ho sakati he lekin hamaara andolan keval sanskrit ke dharm vigyaan main muslim shikshak kii niyukti ke khilaaf hai
 In the Banasar Hindu University Act and an inscription written outside this faculty, Madan Mohan Malviya has clearly stated that students will be admitted to this college according to the rules of varnasram
 munish mishra yaheen nahin rukate ve kehete hai, biechayu ke parisar main vishwanath kaa bhavy mandir bana he
 In such a way, how can a Muslim go to teach in the class of religious science
 dharm vigyaan ko padhate hue khan-paan main bhi shuddhta baratane ke liye kaha jaataa he, lekin agar shikshak muslim hoga to vah kya maance-machhlee nahin khayega? agar vah khayega to phir kya 'dharm vigyaan' padhaane yogya vah he?pichley saal hi ''kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay kaa itihaas'' naam se jari pustika main bhi yah saaf-saaf likhaa he
 This booklet was issued by the current Vice Chancellor himself
 ek taraf chaatr sanskrit ke dharm vibhaag main kisi muslim shikshak ke naa ghusane dene kii baat par amada hai to duusari taraf vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) ke maanak samvidhan ke khilaaf nahin ja sakate
 The constitution does not allow discrimination on the basis of religion, caste, gender
 aise main vishvavidhyalay prashasan ke saamne virodh pradarshan ko jhelte hue ujisi ke maanak ko bhang na hone dene kii sabase badi chunauti he
 However, the Vice Chancellor, in a meeting held on 14 November, reportedly said that the constitution should be placed above the person as well as to seek legal opinion in the matter
 lekin vishvavidhyalay prashasan ke aadhikarik bayaan ke mutabik biechayu main jari chayan prakriya par kisi bhi tarah ke ghaal mail yaa biechayu act ke khilaaf hone kii baat ko nakaarte hue spasht kar diya he ki chayan prakriya niyamon ke mutabik hui he
 On the other hand, the student movement continues to grow
 biechayu ke hi ek anya vibhaag ke professor ne naam na bataane kii shart par is vivaad par apni raay rakhte hue kaha, chahen aligarh uniwarsity ho yaa phir banaras hindu uniwarsity ho, ek dharmanirpeksh desh main ek khaas dharm aadhaarit shikshak niyukti yaa chaatr bhartee karne yaa na karne kii anumati nahin di ja sakati

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation in the country on 8 November 2016
 aise main khud pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra banaras main bunakaron par notebandi kaa kya asar hua he
 To know this, till date reached Amarpur Batloia area of saraiya of Benares
 ye bunakaron kii ek choti si basti he
 The family of Asram Mohammad Abdul Jalil, who had earned money from demonetisation, has been associated with the business of making Banarasi saris since the last several books
 63 varshiya abdul jaleel or unka betaa bunakar hai, lekin ek saal pehle desh main lagu huinotbandiki maar yah parivaar ab tak jhel rahaa he
 Weaver Abdul Aziz said that 7 years ago, he removed four handloom machines and built a power loom at his house
 jiske baad parivaar kii kamai takreeban saat se aath hajaar rupee maheenaa ho jaati thi, lekin notebandi ke baad unki kamai ab sirf teen se chaar hajaar rupee tak aa gai he
 Weavers' business closed down from demonetisation, he said, adding that the weavers of Banarasi sarees in Banaras and many adjoining districts have almost come to a standstill after demonetisation
 abdul jaleel ke ghar par jo chaar handloom mashine hai, unpar vah khud or unke bete samet do karigar bhi kaam karte the
 Those who were paid 100 to 200 rupees per day
 lekin notebandi ke baad abdul jaleel unako unki mazdooree dene main bhi naakaam the
 Because of which both the artisans left work and went back to their village
 notebandi kii vajah se abdul jaleel ke yahaan 4 power loom main se 2 power loom par kaam bilkul band ho gaya he
 The situation is such that he himself and his son work on 2 power looms and at night he works as a daily laborer in the Madagin area of benaras
 jisase unhen 300 rupee pratidin atirikt kamai hoti he
 Abdul Jalil's family had not yet emerged from the strike of the note that the GST was double killed due to GST implementation
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad unhen banarsi sari banane ke liye tani bana ( dhaagaa jisase sari banati he) kharidne ke bhi laale pad gaye 
 Because its price went up after GST was implemented and they are not able to buy it
 aisi hi haalat saraiya ke ek or bunakar nisaar ahamed or unke 4 bhaaiyon kii he
 a few years ago, Nisar Ahmed and his brothers replaced 5 handloom machines and installed powerloom machines
 5 karigar is par kaam kiya karte the lekin notebandi lagu hone ke baad nisaar ahamed or unke sabhi bhai in kaarigaron kii mazdooree nahin de sakate the to unki chuttee kar di
 Shakeel Ahmed is also a weaver who used to work in Saraiya area but his boss's business condition deteriorated after the note ban
 jisaki vajah se unako unki mazdooree nahin mil rahi thi
 So Shakeel Ahmad quit the work of weaver and started running the trolley
 lekin isamen bhi unki kamai acchhee na hone kii vajah se shakeel ahamed ne saraiya ilaake main hi sabji bechney kaa kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Due to which they earn 100 to 200 rupees daily
 notebandi ke ek saal baad bhi nahin ubreeybdul jaleel, nisaar ahamed or shakeel ahamed banaras or aasapaas ke jilon main kaam kar rahe takreeban 4 lakh un bunakaron main se hai, jin par notebandi kii maar aisi padi ki 1 saal ke baad bhi isse ubar nahin paae
 Experts say that the entire business of making sarees and other textile materials in Banaras and adjoining districts was worth Rs 2,000 crore annually before demonetisation but after the note ban it has fallen by 50 per cent

 What will i do if someone mixes me in my food? akhilesh ke is bayaan par jab media karmi muskuraane lage to unhone kaha ki ye majaak kii baat nahin he
 These governors are not running with the soul of the Constitution, but by the soul of the RSS
 ek tarah se akhilesh ne ishaaron-ishaaron main sarkaar se unki jaan par khatre kii baat kah di
 Akhilesh's cleaning on the suit- i had stuffed in the bungalow, brought uprooted 'where the BJP slept, why sleep there' At the press conference, Akhilesh Yadav said that if we went to the guest house, there is no idea who would have slept there
 unhone kaha ki ham kaise kisi gadde par so jaaen, ham us gadde par kaise so sakate hai jahaan par bijepi kaa aadmi soya ho
 He said that tomorrow i will take my mattress, then they will say look, i have taken the mattress also
 akhilesh ne kaha ki mujhe guest house main bhagava rang pasand nahin aa rahaa tha, isliye hamane use chupa diya
 i like the color white

 unhone kaha ki hamaare desh main nari ko puja jaataa he lekin aisa kya hua ki beti ko bachaane ke liye haath pair jodne pad rahe hai
 And governments have to draw a budget
 piem ne kaha ki aaj jab balak aurbalikaonki janm dar main antar dikhataa he to kaaphi dukh hota he

 unhone kaha ki ab logon ko tay karnaa hoga ki jitne bete paidaa honge, utani hi betiyaan paidaa hongi
 The more the son can read, the more the daughter will also read
 isaki shuruyaat hamen aaj se hi kerani chahie

 PM said that after the coming of our government, we launched Beti Bachao Beti Padhao from Haryana
 jiske baad vahaan par betiyon ke janm ke anupaat main kaaphi sudhaar hua he
 Today, daughters are illuminating the name in the country

 Those who believe that they have a son, will work in old age, then it is wrong
 maine kai baar dekha he ki bete aaraam kii jindagi jite hai lekin maa-baap vriddhashram main rahete hai
 8
 piem ne bataaya ki main soch-vichaar kar jhunjhunu aayaa hum

 70 years ago two pieces of a country occurred
 iske baad puure 70 saal tak uttar korea ke kisi shaasha ne kabhi dakshin korea kii sarajameen par kadam tak nahin rakhaa or 70 saal baad 27 april ko jab donon mulk ke netaaon ne pehali baar haath milaayaa tab donon ke haath to ek-duusare ke haathon main the, magar kadam tab bhi donon ke apane-apane mulk main the
 Later, both of them stepped on each other's land and with this, North Korean leader Marshal Kim Jongown became the first leader of his country to step into South Korea
 40 kadam uthaane main lage 70 salbus chand qadam kii baat thi
 If you count, maybe 40 steps
 magar in 40 qadamon ko uthaane main puure 70 baras lag gaye
 Yes, 70 years
 70 saalon main pehali baar uttar korea kaa koi shaasha dakshin korea kii sarazamin par kadam rakhane ja rahaa tha
 This was going to be a historic moment for both Korean countries after the two-piece Korea break 70 years ago

 North Korean dictator Marshall Kim Jong walks those 40 steps and then stops at one place
 darasal, yahi wo lakeer he jo uttar korea or dakshin korea kii sarhadon ko baantati he
 North Korea is where Kim Jong Un stands on this line drawn on the foundation of hate
 or lakeer ke us paar dakshin korea, jahaan is vakt dakshin korea ke netaa moon je-in khadey hai
 The hands of the two leaders met at the border stop as soon as they reach this line of border

 Now both the leaders were joining hands
 magar ab bhi donon apane-apane desh main hi the
 On South Korea's land, Kim smiles briefly after this
 baat-baat main hi moon je-in kim jong un ko dakshin koricea aane kii daavat dete hai
 Kim takes the first step at the same time and the second step was on South Korea's land
 70 saal baad uttar koricea ke kisi shaasha ne dakshin korea kii zamin par ab kadam rakh diya tha
 Kim Jong Un paused for a few moments, after which the two leaders first posed for North Korea
 phir yun palatate hai
 Now the mouth had turned towards South Korea
 tasviren ab dakshin koriai media utaar rahi thi
 Now Kim Jong Un had to move towards South Korea
 aage kii baatcheet ke liye
 South Korean leaders also point to him walking
 uttar korea kii jameen par moon ke kadammgar tabhi kim jong apane padosi mulk ke netaa se ek guzarish karte hai
 Now Kim with this request
 
 Moon holds Jae-in's hand
 waapas palatate hai
 Just take two steps and with this, both the leaders were standing on the North Korean land
 yahaan donon netaa ek baar phir garmjoshi ke saath haath milaate hai
 Then take two steps back and reach South Korea
 kya mit paaegi nafrat kii lackyaab donon netaa dakshin korea kii sarhad main aage bade chale ja rahe the
 For further conversation
 haalanki sarhad kii lakeer ab bhi apni jagah he

 After the announcement of demonetisation, Minister of State for Finance Arjun Meghwal appeared in the queue of atms in his constituency of Rajasthan
 NDTV se baat karte hue unhone sweekaar kiya ki vah pradhanmantri kii notebandi kii ghoshnaa se pehle isse sambandhit choti team kii yojana kaa hissaa nahin the
 But looking at the initial trends, he believes that this is an important step towards improving the campaign against black money
 apni baat ko spasht karte hue unhone kaha, ''yahaan tak ki ek makaan kharidne ke liye aapako adhikansh cash main bhugtan karnaa hota tha
 Now within a year, people will see a big change in it
 ek aadmi aaj vitt mantralay aayaa or usne bataaya ki puraane noton main jis flats kii keemat 40 lakh rupee thi, nae noton main uski keemat 12 lakh rupee rah gai he
 Obviously you can see the result
 '' It is worth mentioning that when PM Narendra Modi announced demonetisation on November 8, 86 per cent of the popular notes of 500-1000 went out of circulation
 uske baad se bainkon main cash kii killat ke chalate baari bheed he
 Out of the two lakh atms in the country, the arrival of new notes has been possible only in about half of atms

 "scandal by scandal exposed during Manmohan Singh's tenure is counted as one of the major reasons for the Congress's debacle at the hands of BJP in 2014

 Explaining his point, he said, "even to buy a house you had to pay most of the cash
 ab ek saal ke bheetar logon ko isamen bada badlaav dekhne ko milegaa
 a man came to the Finance Ministry today and he said that the price of a flat in old notes was Rs 40 lakh, its value in new notes has been Rs 12 lakh

 nav nirvaachit loksabhaa kaa satr somvaar se shuru ho rahaa he, lekin vipakshi khemaa abhi bhi teetar-bitar najar aa rahaa he
 The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) called an all-party meeting on Sunday
 magar vipaksh kii taraf se abhi tak aisi koi pahal dekhne ko nahin mili
 Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP PL Punia has said that the newly elected mps of Lok Sabha can meet the leaders of opposition parties after taking oath
 congress ne sadan main abhi apane netaa kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 The confidence of the opposition has been shaken by the huge mandate given to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Lok Sabha elections
 sansad kaa satr somvaar se shuru hone ja rahaa he, lekin vipakshi partiyaan ab bhi narendra modi ko mili badi jite ke sadame se ubar nahin pai hai
 That is, the opposition is not even ready to face the ruling party in the House
 modi sarkaar ko tamaam muddon par gherne ke liye vipakshi partiyon ke bich abhi tak koi samanvay karne kii koshish bhi najar nahin ai, or na hi in dalon kii taraf se aadhikarik taur par abhi tak koi bayaan aayaa he
 Congress leader PL Punia said to 'aaj Tak', 'now is the time
 vastav main loksabhaa main 20 june se hi kaam shuru hogi
 The first three days will take the newly elected members to administer oaths and complete administrative work
 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe bharosa he ki loksabhaa main modi sarkaar ko vibhinn muddon par gherne ke vaaste vipaksh ke netaa ek manch par aaenge or aage kii ranneeti tay karenge
 'there is a lot of confusion about the current position of the Congress president, and it is not yet decided who will be the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha? PL Punia says that it is time to choose the Leader of the House
 yah kaam hamaari sansadeey dal kii netaa sonia gandhi puraa karengi
 Punia says, 'I am confident that the leaders of opposition parties will come together and raise issues of national interest in the Lok Sabha
 ' vahiin aam aadmi party ke rajyasabha saasand sanjay singh kaa kahana he ki AAP ke paas rajyasabha main teen jabaki loksabhaa main ek sadsy he
 Our situation may be weaker than NDA but we will not let it go so easily
 unhone kaha ki ham sabhi muddon masalan aarthik mandi, berogari, krishi sankat or desh main sookhe kii sthiti ko lekar sawaal ko uthaaenge
 The incident precedes the Bihar election results
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah apane khaas sipahasalaron se man kii baat kuch is andaaj main kah rahe the, ''jin-jin rajyon main hamaari sarkaar he, vahaan mukhyamantri kaa rabad stamp pradesh adhyaksh nahin hona chahie kyonki isse sanghathan chaupat hota he
 "but the opposite results of the Bihar elections have influenced Shah's intention
" sutron ke mutabik, haar ke baad vaale hafte main jab party ke kuch varisht padaadhikari shah se mili to unka aatmavishvaas hilaa hua tha or ve kisi bhi nirnay se pehle har baarik pahalu kii jaankaree ekatrit kar rahe the
 But the change in strategy came out of the marathon meeting on November 10, when Shah discussed the upcoming strategy for five hours with full-time organizational in-charges from the Sangh and the first glimpse of it came on November 21, when the party had Union Sports Minister Announced to make Sarbananda Sonowal the state president of Assam and head of the Election Management Committee
 sutron ke mutabik, sanghathan mantriyon kii baithkka agenda to mukhya taur se sanghathanaatmak chunaav kii pragati tha, lekin isamen sabase pehle bihar kii haar par charchaa hui
 It was of the opinion that though the party may have won four out of six state elections after Lok Sabha elections and lost only two, Bihar and Delhi have a different message of defeat
 ab shah adhyaksh rahen yaa nahin, lekin party ranneetik badlaav kii disha main aage badhegi
 BJP is realizing that the time has come to change the strategy of contesting elections by keeping the face of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 baithak main is baat par bhi charchaa hui ki bhale mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar project nahin kiya jaae, lekin chunaav puri tarah se rajya ikai ko aage karke hi ladaa janaa chahie
 But the question is, will Shah extend this agenda beyond Assam to Uttar Pradesh and Punjab as well? The immediate impact of Bihar's defeat in the first episode is seen by the party's activism on Assam, when for the first time, the cabinet minister of the Modi government is handed back the state's command
 sonoval mantri banane se pehle bhi assam bijepi ke adhyaksh the or unka bijepi ke saath lanbaa itihaas bhi nahin rahaa he
 He was the president of the All Assam Students Union from 1992-99 and then with the Assam Gana Parishad before joining the BJP in 2011
 lekin unki lokapriyata rajya main kaaphi he
 So when Shah included senior Congress leader Hemant Biswa Sarma in the party two months ago, Sonowal was angered
 haalanki assam bijepi ke prabharee mahendra singh india today se baatcheet main kisi naaraazgi or sonoval kii niyukti ko bihar chunaav kii haar se jodgaye se inkaar karte hai
 He says, "it was a long time ago in the organization
 unki chhavi bahut acchhee he or unako lekar kaaryakartaaon kii maang thi
 Now we will make Assam a terror and Congress-free state, people here have given opportunity to many parties and now will give BJP a chance to make Assam the number one state
 '' rajya bijepi kii chunavi taiyaari ko lekar mahendra singh bataate hai ki sabhi 126 vidhansabha kshetra main booth se lekar 36 jilon kaa sanghathanaatmak dhaancha taiyaar ho chukaa he
 The party's victory in the local body elections is encouraging
 itnaa hi nahin, sadsyta abhiyaan main assam ne 25 lakh ke lakshya ke mukaable 28 lakh kaa lakshya hasil kiya or mahasampark abhiyaan main 22 fisadi tak pahunchakar sabase awwal he
 On the other hand, the BJP, which is considering the competition in Uttar Pradesh as extremely difficult, is in a dilemma about the face like Bihar
 upi bijepi ke prabharee or rashtriya upaadhyaksh om prakaash maathur kehete hai, ''prabharee ke naate meri raay he ki hamen samuhik netritv main janaa chahie, lekin sansadeey board jo aakhri faisla karegaa, ham usee par aage badhenge
 "but Mathur argues on the possibility of Bihar's defeat affecting UP or giving preference to the state unit
" i do not make any strategy or make any changes, i am influenced by any side effect, whatever work i do
 i do it under a long term strategy
 '' bijepi ne sanghathan ke str par upi kii chunavi taiyaari kaa kagaji guna-bhaag kar kaaryakartaaon ko kaam par laga diya he
 But there are more than half a dozen contenders for the state president, including Dharampal Singh, Swatantradev Singh, Ramashankar Katheria, Manoj Sinha, Mahendra Singh, and it is expected that the Bihar defeat in this appointment will definitely have a lesson
 alaakaman yahaan bhi assam kii tarah kaaryakartaaon kii bhaavana kaa dhyaan rakhega
 Similarly, worried about the growing move of the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab, the BJP is doing a tricky move
 bijepi kii punjab ikai ke netaa maanate hai ki gathbandhan main jane se party buree tarah se haaregi
 That is why the local unit has long favored breaking the alliance with the Akali Dal (badal) and going to the elections alone
 lekin rajya ikai kii raay ko tarjeeh die jane ke sawaal par punjab bijepi ke adhyaksh camel sharma kehete hai, ''bijepi ek rashtriya party he or modi ji hamaare swaabhaavik cheharaa hai
 Anyway, Punjab elections are still far away and whatever decision will be taken in this regard, it is for the central leadership to take
 '' lekin sharma kii daleel se itar sthaneey ikai kai baar dilli darbar main aakar akali dal se gathbandhan todgaye kii guhaar laga chuki he
 Some other BJP leaders believe that the way Akali Dal and the Badal family have lost their image and increased aap's influence in Punjab, it would be a suicidal move to contest elections
 lekin in chunavi rajyon se itar kendriya netritv ko chunauti party shasit rajyon se bhi milti dikh rahi he
 The Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan are in the mood to re-assign the current presidents of their choice while the local anti-camp is opposing
 chhattisgarh main is babat hui 25 november kii kor group kii baithak kaaphi tanaavpurn rahi
 There is a possibility that this time Chief Minister Raman Singh insists on repeating his choice i
e
 current president Dharam Lal Kaushik, then the consensus of the BJP will generally be broken, even if the opposition camp is defeated
 isi tarah madhya pradesh main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan bhi nand kumaar chouhan kii hi tajposhi chaahate hai, lekin virdohi khemaa or khud kendriya netritv is paksh main nahin maane ja rahe
 If sources are to be believed, Shah's choice may be Kailash Vijayvargiya, but Sangh's opinion will matter to this extent
 jabaki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje maujuuda adhyaksh ashok paranami ko lalitget (cond) main majbootee se bachaav karne kaa inaam dena chaahati hai
 But if sources are to be believed, the National Joint Organization Minister V
N
 satish is baat se khafa hai ki jaipur main mukhyamantri awaas (13 siemr) satta-sanghathan donon kaa centre ban gaya he, jabaki ve samanaantar centre ke himachati hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether Nanya will run the Chief Ministers in these three states or Shah will be able to impose his choice
 sanghathan main centre kaa niyantran swaabhaavik he, lekin jaisaa ki sanghathan ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, bihar kii haar ke baad ab itnaa to tay he ki rajyon ko bhi puri power rahane vaali he
 China has appealed to Iran to cooperate with UN inspectors
 haalanki, soochna dene ke haalia anurodhon ko thukaraane evam samvedansheel sthalon par jane se manaa karne ko lekar iran kii aalochana karne se china ne inkaar kar diya
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Li said that Iran should be ready for more talks and maintain a positive stance of dialogue between Tehran and the international community
 loksabhaa chunaav kii aahat ke saath raajnneetik rup se sabase mahatvapurn maane jane vaale uttar pradesh main rajanetaaon ke paala badalane kaa khel shuru hone ja rahaa he
 Some politicians have started looking into other parties due to the possibility of losing their current party due to ticket cuts
 uttar pradesh main kai aise saansad hai jo apane vartmaan dal se dobaaraa jeet kii ummid nahin rakh rahe hai
 In such a situation, they have started knocking on the doors of other parties
 kai aise saansad hai, jinke liye unke dalon ne hi maan liya he ki ve is baar apni seat nahin nikaal paaenge
 In the fear of getting their tickets cut, these mps are trying to establish their relationship with other parties
 padhein:upi ke mantri munh kholte hai or
 
 
 After the ticket was cut from Samajwadi Party (SP), an MP from Bundelkhand has taken the initiative to warm up the old relationship with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)
 unhone kuch din pehle basapa ke sheersh netaaon se mulaakaat kar apni maujuuda seat se tikat kii daavedaari kii he
 SP has made the former MP a candidate by cutting the ticket of the current MP from here
 sapa se tikat katane ke baad duusare dal se tikat kaa jugad karne main lage is netaa ne naam jaahir nahin karne kii shart par kaha ki unhone pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav jeeta or is baar bhi unheen kii jeet kii prabal sambhaavna he
 The workers are also in favor, but the party leadership ignored and cut their ticket
 unke samarthakon or aam logon kii maang he ki ve chunaav laden
 They will contest the election to honor the wishes of the supporters
 gandhi parivaar ke dabadabe vaale ilaake ke ek congressi saansad ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki vah bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kaa darwaja khatkhata rahe hai
 According to sources, these mps had earlier approached the SP, but from there they got no response, then they knocked on the door of BJP in their old house
 bhaajapa main unke liye haa to kar di jaati, lekin usee ilaake se party apane fire brands netaa varun gandhi ko maidan main utaarne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Because of this, no decision is being made right now
 unhen aas-paas kii kisi duusari seat se ladaaya ja saktaa he
 When his party cut the ticket this time, the leader who contested the last Lok Sabha election from Amla Lok Sabha seat of Bareilly on the SP ticket, has started raising pangs from the BJP by announcing that he will quit his party
 is netaa ko aanwala se bhaajapa kaa tikat milanaa tay mana ja rahaa he, kyonki aanwala se vartmaan saansad menka gandhi kii apni paramparaagat seat pilibhit se maidan main utarane kii charchaaen hai
 a Congress MLA from Bundelkhand also wants to contest the Lok Sabha elections, but he has approached the SP leadership following the indications that the high command is not giving tickets
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke amroha or hathras se rashtriya lok dal (ralod) ke vartmaan saansadon ko lagata he ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main ve apni party ke tikat par jeet nahin darj kar paaenge
 So he joined the SP
 inamen se ek mahila saansad ko to sapa ne tikat dene kaa elaan kar bhi diya he
 State Congress leader Subodh Srivastava says that the party leadership deliberates with local leaders about the developmental work done by that leader in five years, considering various aspects before cutting the ticket of a sitting MP
 yah baat sach he ki har raajnneetik dal zyada se zyada siten jeetna chahta he, aise main vah us netaa ko dobaaraa ummidavaar kyon banayega jo paanch saal janata ke bich gaya hi nahin or uski jeet kii sambhaavnaaen kam hai
 Political analyst HN Dixit says that nowadays there is a lack of political commitment among the leaders

 Young children wet diapers very frequently
 aise main use din main kai baar badalane kii jarurat padati he lekin diaper badalanaa itnaa aasaan kaam bhi nahin he
 It is difficult for young children to wear or remove anything, as well as many precautions have to be taken while changing the diaper of the child
 chote bacchon kaa immune system bahut viksit nahin hota he or unki twachaa bhi behad komal hoti he
 In such a situation, the risk of infection increases greatly, so it is important that you take special care of these things while changing the diaper of the child: 1
 diaper badalane se pehle ye sunishchit kar len ki bachche ke istemaal se judi sari chijen aapke paas hon
 So that you don't have to get up in the middle of changing diapers
 2
 Put the child to sleep on a flat spot before changing the diaper
 taaki diaper badalane main aasaani rahe
 Wherever you put your child to sleep, the place should be clean
 3
 While taking diapers for the baby, keep in mind that the diapers are light colored
 bahut rangeen diaper bachche ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 4
 nayaa diaper pehanaane se pehle puraane diaparako saavdhaanee se hataa len
 Clean up after removing the dirty diaper
 safai ke liye istemaal hone vaale pani main aap chahen to dettol daal sakate hai
 5
 is dauraan bachche ko duusare kaamon main uljhaakar rakhen taaki wo aasaani se diaper pahan le
 Do not tie the diaper too tight or the baby may suffer
 diaper hameshaa thodaa dhilaa hi rakhen lekin bahut adhik dhilaa bhi nahin

 Bollywood stars are leaving for New York to pack back for the IIFA Award
 14 july se shuru hone ja rahe is glamras aword event ko bollywood kaa sabase bada event kaha jaae to galat nahin hoga
 Bachchan family will be missing this time too from small stars to big stars
 aakhir kyon bachchan family is event kaa hissaa nahin banati
 Let's find out the reason
 ek samay tha jab bollywood industry kaa sabase glamras aword event kahe jane vaale IIFA awords main amitabh bachchan IIFA ke brands ambesder the
 But in 2010, Amitabh Bachchan and his entire family decided to boycott IIFA
 darasal jab saal 2010 main abhinayta amitabh bachchan ne IIFA 2010 ke liye pramotional video shoot kiya tha to iske organisers ne unka kaaphi mazaaq udaaya tha
 Seeing this kind of treatment by the organizers, the Bachchan family decided that now they will never be a part of IIFA
 haalanki ye khabaren bhi khub charchaa main hai ki aishwarya raay ke eks loverasalmaan khanki vajah se amitabh bachchan ke parivaar ne IIFA aword kaa hissaa naa banane kaa faisla liya
 It is reported that the award ceremony held in Sri Lanka in the year 2010 was neither consulted by Amitabh Bachchan and the show was hosted by Salman
 is event ke itane kareeb rah chuken amitabh bachchan ko arganaisers ke algaav se dukh hua or unhone isse baahar aane kaa man bana liya
 The organizers were shocked by this decision of Amitabh and they tried their best to convince Big b but the matter did not happen because the superstar had made up his mind to never be a part of this event
 unhone vinramata se manaa karte hue kah diyaaki ab wo IIFA main koi dilchaspee nahi rakhte hai
 But here also the question arises that the Bachchan family may not have left because of Salman's entry in IIFA
 
 
 
 There was noise of Vyapam scam everywhere
 karodon logon ke kaan is baat ke liye taras rahe the ki pradhanmantri narendra modi shaayad madhya asia ke paanch deshon kii yatra par ravaanaa hone se pehle madhya pradesh ke is khooni ghotaale par apane lab kholen
 But nothing like this happened
 agle din subah 10 baje bhopal ke shyamala hills ke mukhyamantri awaas main phone kii ghanti baji
 BJP president Amit Shah was on the other side of the line
 kareeb paanch minute shivaraj singh chouhan se baat hui
 Within half an hour, the Chief Minister called the journalists and announced that they would request the Madhya Pradesh High Court that the investigation into the Vyapam scam be handed over to the CBI
 har mukhyamantri kii jindagi main kabhi-kabhi aisa daur aata he, jab use is tarah ke faisle lene padate hai jo siyasat main bhuuchaal laa dete hai
 But 56-year-old Shivraj, who is going to complete a decade at the helm of power, took a decision after a few hours of political upheaval that saved his clean image of the fabricated over the years to some extent from getting it in the mud Was the last attempt
 yah bhi hakeekat he ki medical daakhilon or sarkari bhartiyon main hue ab tak ke sabase bhayanak ghotaale main shivaraj par sidhe koi daag nahin laga he or na un par koi maamla darj he
 At least for now, they have not been caught red-handed enough to celebrate the downfall of another political figure
 lekin vyapam main ho rahi mauton ne aisa maahaul bana diya, jahaan chouhan kii daleelon kii koi sunwaayee nahin thi
 In the end, he had no choice but to let the investigation of the case go into the hands of an outside agency, which is known to be a master of political winds
 lekin sihor ke chote se gaanv se nikalakar satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane vaale shivaraj agar thaharkar ghotaale ke calendar palaten to paaenge ki chidipoon ko khet chugane ke liye ve khud bhi jimmedaar hai
 And then they will be simmering with the feeling that they have not engaged in their career
 india today kii padtaal bataati he ki 2008 se 2013 ke darmyaan kai aise maukey aae jahaan najar milaae bina baat karne vaale shivaraj gachha kha gaye
 It is worth mentioning that between 2008 and 2012, he was with the Department of Health Education, which governed the Board of Vocational Examinations (vyapam)
 iske baavjood jaise-jaise vyapam kii mauton kaa aankada badhata gaya, ve chaati thok-thokkar yah kehete rahe ki vyapam kaa khulaasa karne vaale asli 'visaladbralovar' ve khud hai, aakhir unhone hi to 2013 main vyapam kii jaanch kii jimmedaari madhya pradesh ke vishesh kaary bal (estf) ko di thi
 But this 'innocent' argument of the Chief Minister is also not cut short
 masalan, ratlam se purv nirdaleey vidhayak or vyapam mahaghotaalaa kitaab ke lekhak paras sakalechaa yaad dilaate hai ki ve to bahut pehle, july 2009 main, yah maamla madhya pradesh vidhansabha main uthaa chuke the
 If not remembered, then the Chief Minister himself should dig through the records of the proceedings of the Assembly
 udhar, sarkari doctor or maamle ke visaladbralovar dow
 Anand Rai says that on July 6, 2009, he had filed a complaint of rigging in the PMT at Indore Crime Branch
 aisa bhi nahin he ki sarkaar ko in baton kaa pataa nahin he
 After receiving the complaints, the state government had asked the police team to investigate the matter on December 17, 2009
 iske baad 31 march, 2011 ko chouhan ne khud vidhansabha ko bataaya ki vyapam ghotaale kii jaanch chal rahi he
 In July and November that year, he again repeated the same thing in the House and for the second time he had said that 114 suspected students have been identified and firs have been lodged
 lekin isse vyapam ghotaale kaa kya bigadsa tha
 Statistics show that the police continued to investigate the tortoise and the scandal of the scandal grew stronger
 vyapam ke dastavej bataate hai ki farjivade ke chalate 2008 main jahaan 42 medical daakhile radd karne pade, vahiin 2009 main 85, 2010 main 90, 2011 main 98, 2012 main 286 or 2013 main 439 medical daakhile radd kar die gaye
 In 2014, the government canceled the exam and saved its honor

 ''chouhan par sage-sambandhiyon kaa hit saadhane ke bhi aarope lage
 When his niece Ritu Chauhan passed the MPPSC-2008 examination and became deputy collector, the Congress sensed a conspiracy
 madhya pradesh congress ke pravaktaa ke
 K
 mishra yaad dilaate hai, ''maine jab 2011 main yah mudda uthaaya to bajaae maamle kii jaanch karne ke mukhyamantri ne mere paas sandeshaa patha bheja ki siyasat main parivaar ko ghaseetna acchhee baat nahin he
 "while the government maintains that the MPPSC is an autonomous body and does not interfere in its functioning, Mishra claims that the rules were changed to benefit Ritu
" ve bataate hai ki pariksha kii kapiyaan or merit list hasil karne ke liye unhone kai baar artiai arji lagaai, lekin jawaab nahin mila
 There was a rule to keep the copies of the examination safe for 10 years, but the rules were revised six times between 2011 and 2013
 ant main pariksha kii kapiyaan teen maheene ke baad nasht karne kaa praavdhaan kar ritu se jude dastavej khatm kar die gaye
 Chauhan's wife Sadhna Singh's name was also scandalized
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki parivahan aarakshak bhartee pariksha 2012 main sadhana ke paitruk jile gondia (maharashtra) ke 17 logon kii bhartee madhya pradesh ke farji pate bataakar hui
 Not only this, where 198 recruitments were advertised earlier, later 332 recruitments were done
 yah baat bhi gaur karne laayak he ki baad main dhaandhlee ke aarope main 39 logon ke khilaaf maamle darj kiye gaye or kathith taur par gondia ke bataae ja rahe 17 logon ko naukari jwine nahin karne di gai
 Despite coming under suspicion of examination and making serious allegations, no one dared to question Sadhana Singh
 july 2014 main india today se khaas baatcheet main chouhan ne kaha tha, ''vipaksh meri pratimaa khandit karnaa chahta he
 When the Congress did not get anything against me, they brought a false case of my wife and Bhanji
 ''isi tarah chouhan ke tatkaaleen nijee sachiv premuchandra prasad ko lekar bhi ungliyaan uthin jin par piemti 2012 main galat tareeke se apni beti kaa daakhila karaane kaa aarope laga
 Despite the case being registered, he was never strictly interrogated and he easily took anticipatory bail on 21 June 2014
 congress un par apni beti ke alaava 200 or logon kii galat dhang se bhartee kaa aarope lagaati he
 Why did the opponents leave hands, Shivraj, who is battling the chance, is today a weaker leader than ever before
 aaj banaavati aatmavishvaas ke saath tivi camaron kaa saamana karte hue ve sochate honge ki pandit jawaharlal nehru kii 'chachaa nehru' vaali chhavi kii tarj par unhone jo 'mamaa ji' kii chhavi banaai thi, vah kis teji se chhij rahi he
 After the scandal hit, the party spared his chief minister's chair, but reduced his status
 vaise rajya main unke siyaasi rakeeb najuk siyaasi vakt ko alaakaman se kahin pehle tad gaye the
 That's why State Home Minister Babulal Gaur told Tapak that no file of scam would pass through his eyes
 bujurg netaa ne kaha ki vyapam ghotaale main rajyapal ke khilaaf darj exiar ko khatm karne ke hycourt ke faisle ko chunauti nahin dene ke nirnay main bhi unki salaah nahin lee gai
 On the other hand, after the rise of Chauhan, Union Minister Uma Bharti, who was facing political exile from the state, did not take any time to settle the accounts of the past
 india today tivi se unhone kaha, ''mujhe dar lagata ki kisi din meri dhajjiyaan na ud jaaen
 Policemen in Madhya Pradesh follow me
 ''udhar, congress fikaraa kasati he ki jab upie ke saare rajyapal bevajaah hataa die gaye to, daagi yadav modi ke itane sage kyon ho gaye? chouhan ne rajyapal ko hataane ke maamle main hameshaa naram rukh akhriyaar kiya
 On this issue, Shivraj, who started the pilgrimage darshan scheme for the elderly, argues that he took a sensitive stance in view of the declining health of 86-year-old Yadav
 vyapam ke aaropee bete shailesh kii is saal march main sandigdh maut ke baad se unki tabiyat upar-neeche hoti rahati he
 By the way, Shivraj's public support in Madhya Pradesh has never been less

 The party has called for a statewide bandh on 16 July

 Frequent increase in Congress offices, often seen in desolate Congress offices
 congressiyon ko 12 saal baad sattasukh kii aas bandhi he
 But Chauhan's future now depends on how trustworthy is the excel sheet submitted by the whistleblower Prashant Pandey of Indore to the court
 pandeya kaa daawa he ki vyapam ke mastermind nitin mohendra se jadbrat asli excel shit main 48 jagah mukhyamantri kaa naam likhaa tha, lekin estf tak pahunchane se pehle hi indore krime branch ne excel shit se chhedchhad kar mukhyamantri kii jagah uma bharti, rajyapal or bahut si jagah mantri naam likh diya
 bjp's argument on these allegations is that Pandey is an agent of Congress
 haalanki duusare visaladbralovar anand raay par isi tarah kaa aarope lagane ke baad bijepi kii tab saanp-chhachhundar jaisi gat ho gai jab raay ne khulaasa kiya ki ve to aresas ke patibaddh swayamsevak rahe hai
 However, Pandey claims that his excel sheet is not only completely accurate, but he has also certified its veracity from the prestigious Truth Lab in Bengaluru
 pandeya isse pehle sadhana singh or vyapam ke aaropee sudhir singh ke bich kathith esemes samvaad kaa dbrayora bhi jari kar chuke hai
 In these SMS, the wife of the Chief Minister is allegedly forwarding the names of contestants for selection in Vyapam
 estf ne ab tak in esemes ko yah kahkar khaarij kiya he ki ye galat tareeke se hasil kiye gaye hai, lihaaja, ye jaanch main vichaar karne laayak hi nahin hai

 But on Monday, Anandiben Patel sent her resignation to party president Amit Shah before writing about her removal from the chief minister's post on Facebook
 2015 se thi party se hatane kii ummidanandiben patel ne likhaa ki unhone 2 maheene pehle netritv komukhyamantri ke pad se hataneke liye kaha tha
 Because Anandiben Patel is going to be 75 years old in November this year
 anandiben patel ne jis tarah se mukhyamantri ke pad se istipha diya he wo prescrypted he
 Because these were being speculated since the Patidars' agitation on August 25, 2015, Anandiben Patel could be removed from the post of Chief Minister
 lekin piem modi neanandiben patel komukhyamantri pad se hataane par us vakt roak laga di thi
 The bitterness in the relationship between party president Amit Shah and Anandiben Patel is not hidden from anyone

 On the other hand, when Congress won the rural areas with a good lead, the concern of PM Modi and Amit Shah increased
 piem modi ne apane vishwaasapaatr or gujarat ke purv prabharee om prakaash maathur se gujarat kii raajnneetik paristhitiyon par report taiyaar karai
 Om Mathur submitted his report to PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah on 25 April
 om maathur ne apni report main kaha tha
 
 
 1: The movement of Patidars should not be ignored
 2:rajya sarkaar or party main gutbaji ko khatm karnaa chahie
 3: To remove the lack of coordination between the government and the party as quickly as possible
 5:sarkaar ke faislon main party kii bhagidaari ko badhanaa
 6: The central leadership will periodically review the functioning of the party and the government
 padhein: anandiben patel ke man kii baat, in 5 vajahon se diya mukhyamantri pad se istipha2017 vidhansabha chunaav main nuksaan kaa darasutron kii maane to us vakt om maathur ne piem modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ko report ke aadhaar par saaf bataa diya tha ki agar anandiben patel ko samay rahete nahin hataaya gaya to november 2017 main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main party ko bada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Just after that, PM Modi started looking for an appropriate time for Anandiben's departure
 PM ne cabinet main nae chehron ko di jagah5 july ko apane mantrimandal ke vistaar ke samay bhi piem modi ne gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar gujarat se nae chehron ko jagah di thi
 Gujarat has the highest number of Patels in Saurashtra
 purushottam roopala kadava petal he
 Rupala replaced Mohan Bhai Kundaria as minister
 mansukh bhai mandavi ko mansukh bhai vasava kii jagah or saath hi gujarat se ek adivasee chehren ko bhi mantrimandal main jagah di thi
 Anandiben Patel can become governor After August 15, the government has to appoint governors in 3 states
 nae rajyapalon ke liye 2 naamon ko pakkaa mana ja rahaa he wo hamanandiben patelor najma hepatulla
 Discussions are going on in the party and the Sangh regarding 3 names
 jaldi hi us par bhi faisla le liya jayega
 If sources are to be believed, PM Modi should send Anandiben Patel as the Governor in which state now, but along with that his plan is that the party will benefit in the Assembly by making Anandiben Patel the Vice President in August 2017, just before the Gujarat elections
 agar piem modi ne abhiaanandiben petlpar faisla nahin liya hota to iskaa harjaana party ko gujarat chunaav main bhugatna padataa or unki leadership par sawaal khadey hote
 Which is not good for PM Modi's image
 isliye piem modi ko jaanane vaale kehete hai ki modi apni chhavi ko lekar bahut samvedansheel rahete hai

 shrivastav ne kaha, 'maine film ko nahin dekha lekin riviging cameti panel ke sadasyon ne jo kaaran die hai un par unka santusht hona jaruri he
 It is clear that some provisions of the guidelines have been violated
 samalangikta akelaa mudda nahin balki kai or dishanirdeshon kaa bhi ulanghan hua he
 According to Srivastava, legal avenues are open to the filmmaker
 agar wo pehle hi tribunel ke paas jate to wo sahi rasta hota
 Even now they can go to the tribunal
 agar wo phir bhi santusht nahin ho to court ja sakate he
 It cannot be said that the film will never be released
 shrivastav ne, 'ye kahana galat he ki adhiktar filmon ko certificate nahin diya ja rahaa yaa filmkaaron ko hoicourt janaa pad rahaa he
 If we give certificates to 2000 films in a year
 kuch hi filmon ko aisi sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, baaki sab paas ho jaati he
 Pahlaj Nihalani said, films which are not passable, will not pass
 CBFC Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani refused to say anything about 'ka bodyscapes'
 nihlani ke mutabik maamla court ke vichaaradhin he, isliye wo is par kuch nahin kah sakate
 However, in a simple perspective, Nihalani definitely said that if films are not able to pass, then surely they will not pass
 kisi ke kaaran camere par nahin bataae ja sakate
 Guidelines must be followed: CBFC member Mamta Kale says board members come from different regions
 unki koi purv dharna nahin hoti
 If CBFC refuses to give a certificate to a film, then there must be solid reasons behind it
 mamata kaale ne kaha ki filmon ko lekar kuch vishisht dishanirdesh hai jinka sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 This is a sensitive issue, vigilance should be observed while showing religious characters
 filmon main aisa kuch naa dikhaaen jisase kisi varg kii bhavanaaen aahat hon: raja murambhinayta raja muraad kii is mudde par raay he ki sensor board par ungali uthaane se pehle ye sochaa janaa chahie ki sensor board ko kuch dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karnaa hota he
 According to them, the film has to be given a certificate
 raja muraad ne kaha ki agar wo filmon main lesbians, transgender yaa ge ko dikhaate hai to ye aisa nahin hona chahie jo samaaj ke kisi varg ko aahat kare

 is khubasurat sketch ko banane vaale behad pratibhashali fifipevj kaa dhanyavad
 ' jimi shergill khud ko samay ke saath chalane vaala kalakaar maanate hai
 He says that as an actor, if you flow in the stream of time, then you get a chance to live new characters and at the same time also take a look at the artist inside yourself
 jimi bataate hai, 'mere paas jab bhi koi script aati he to sabase pehle main usamen apane kirdaar kii us tasviir ko talashta hum jo kuch nayaapan liye hue ho
 Along with this, after knowing the blueprint that has been formed in the mind of the writer and the director, i also put my mind a little bit
 've ek prayogvaadi actor bhi hai
 He does not like being alive in the same kind of character
 ve chaahate hai ki unke phens unhen har baar nae charitra main dekhen
 "I was the normal villain in the script of Mukkabaaz," said Jimmy
 lekin jab billi kii aankh jaisaa kaantect lens maine apni ek aankh main lagaaya to anuraag kashyap ne kaha ki yahi luk he jo main chahta tha
 When thinking of the actor and director, it is fun to work
 us villen ko khub pasand kiya gaya
 Jimmy, who has worked in films ranging from 'match' to 'de De Pyaar De', faces a big challenge right now
 kyonki, unhen ek ke baad ek karke teen filmon main apane chaahane waalon ko khush karnaa he
 Those films are the action drama 'family of Thakurganj', the comedy drama 'jhoota Kahin Ka' and the erratic black comedy 'judicial Hai Kya'
 jimi shergill asal main gulzaar ke sahaayak bananaa chaahate the, lekin unke andar ke kalakaar ko dekhakar gulzaar ne unhen 'maachis' main abhinay kaa mauka diya
 After that Jimmy advanced his career in speed
 48 saal ke jimi ne apane kariyar kii 23 saal kii lambii pari khel lee he or 70 hindi filmon, 14 punjabi filmon main kaam karte hue 4 punjabi filmon kaa nirmaan bhi kiya he
 He is very happy to work in his upcoming film 'jhoota Kahin Ka'
 unka kahana he ki wo rishi kapur ke saath film karnaa chaahate the or bahut samay ke baad unhen gane or dance main mauka mila he
 In this film, he is seen dancing to Holi songs and playing with color
 bakaul jimi, 'family aaf thakurganj ke trailor se log yah soch sakate hai ki isamen ection he
 Actually, it has a flavor of humor
 jajmental he kya main bhi log mujhe yaad karenge
 'jimmy is an actor attached to the ground
 gulzaar ke nirdension main 'maachis' karne ke baad bhi unhone apni jameen nahin chodi or aaj bhi wo star vaale nakhron se dur hai
 "I know that low-budget producers come to me and i am happy to work in such films," he says frankly
 vajah yah he ki main inaki filmon main apane kirdaar main prayog kar paata hum jabaki bade binar main prayog karne kaa mauka nahin miltaa he
 'achhe Kahani' inspired Jimmy to work in the series of 'mukkabaaz' and 'saheb Biwi Aur Gangster'
 wo gulzaar ke saath phir se film karnaa chaahate hai to anuraag kashyap kii kisi bhi film main kaam karne ke liye taiyaar rahete hai
 There are some of Jimmy's favorite characters who work equally in Hindi and Punjabi films, which he wants to do again like Saheb of 'saheb Biwi Aur Gangster' series, Bagga of 'happy Bhag Jayegi' series, 'tanu Weds Manu' series
 Raja Awasthi, Amun of Shujit Sarkar's 'shoo Bite', Zaheer of 'munnabhai MBBS' and Arif Khan of 'wadnes Day'
 aaj ke badalte daur ke cinema main bhi jimi khud ko feet maanate hai
 Because he has prepared himself for all kinds of films
 jimi kehete hai, 'main gambhir role kar letaa hum to ection main bhi aage hum
 i do not take time for comedy
 mohabbatein se meri romantic chhavi ab tak barkaraar he
 People are liking dialectics
 've maanate hai ki badalte daur main bhi har tarah ke actor ko kaam mil rahaa he
 But the way new writers are bringing a new story with social issues around us and the actors with normal faces are bringing their character to the common audience, it has also revolutionized the business of new-age cinema
 web siries ne bhi actaron ke saamne kaam kii pitari khol di he
 He says, 'there is no dearth of work for actors like us
 'lekin jimi yah bhi sweekaar karte hai ki wo acting kii bhukh ko mitaane ke liye abhinay kii duniya main vyast rahane se jindagi ko mukammal ji nahin paae hai
 Jimmy said, 'we have enjoyed life less
 magar iskaa afsos nahin he

 is baar kul 58 mantriyon ne shapath lee he to vahiin pichhali baar se alag kai nae chehron ko mauka bhi diya gaya he
 But there are many faces who have not been made ministers this time
 apane bayanon ke kaaran charchaa main rahane vaale anant hegade kii bhi is baar mantrimandal se chuttee ho gai he
 Whether it is about changing the constitution or whether the support of Nathuram Godse on Twitter seems to be the bashing of Anant Hegde
 karnataka kii uttar kannada se dobaaraa chunaav jeet kar aae anant hegade modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main vivaadit bayanon ke liye jane gaye
 In the previous government he was the Minister of State in the Ministry of Skill Development
 pichhali baar sarkaar banane ke baad unke samvidhan badalane ke bayaan ne bijepi ko mushkil main daal diya tha
 If raised the latest issue, he had a tweet just before the election results
 apane twit main unhone mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse par ho rahi charchaa ko sukhad bataaya tha
 Then Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur called Nathuram a patriot and Anant Hegde supported him
 anant hegade ne nathuram godse ko lekar likhaa tha, ‚Äòmain khush hum ki kareeb 7 dashak ke baad aaj kii peedi nae badlaav ke saath is mudde par charchaa kar rahi he
 Hearing this discussion, Nathuram Godse must be feeling good today '
 haalanki, vivaad ke baad unhone kaha tha ki unka acount hack ho gaya tha
 But it seems that this statement has become difficult for them
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jeet ke baad hi sandesh diya tha ki is baar jo bhi badbolepan vaale netaa hai unhen dhyaan dena chahie
 The PM had said that there are some samples in his party, who wake up early in the morning and give a message to the nation
 samvidhan ko lekar kya bole the?2017 main unhone ek bayaan diya tha ki bijepi jald hi samvidhan badal degi, jisamen 'secular' shabd likhaa hua he
 Then he said that some people say that the constitution says that we are secular, so you have to respect it, we respect the constitution, but the constitution has changed many times and it will change in future also, we will change the constitution here
 lekin is bayaan par kaaphi vivaad hua, vipaksh ne modi sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Shortly after that, he had to apologize

 ' Expressing deep concern over the detention of mentally weak Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails, the Supreme Court today asked the government why these people should not be sent back
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki inhen jelon main rakhe rahanaa ‚Äò‚Äòhamen pidaa detaa he
 a bench headed by Justice RM Lodha said that when the leaders of the two countries meet, such matters should be considered on a top level priority

 "the court asked the Center to find out within three weeks what can be done to send these prisoners back to their country?" The court fixed the next hearing on May 2
 peeth ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòisamen koi andeh nahin he ki hiraasat main rakhe jane ke dauraan in kaidiyon ko behtareen suvidhaayen pradaan kii ja rahi hai, lekin samasya yah he ki unhen waapas kyon nahin bheja ja rahaa he

 Singh said that photographs of these prisoners should be given by the Center to the Government of Pakistan so that their identity can be proved by publishing them in the newspapers there because these people are mentally ill
 nyaayalay ne haalanki kaha ki kendra ko yah nirdesh dene main koi pareshaani nahin he ki vah pakistan sarkaar ko in kaidiyon ke photo de, lekin pakistan sarkaar ko to is baat ke liye majaboor nahin kiya ja saktaa ki vah in photo ko prakashit kare
 The bench said, "the Center cannot force the Pakistan High Commission

 The Pakistan High Court will have to proceed in this matter
 ‚Äô‚Äô apni vyavastha main peeth ne kaha ki in kaidiyon ko unki pahchaan sthapit hue bina waapas nahin bheja ja saktaa kyonki vah inke liye badtareen sthiti hogi
 The bench gave this arrangement in the case of 21 inmates jailed despite completing their sentence
 inamen se 16 maansik rup se biimaar hai or paanch gunge-bahere hai
 Pointing to Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's recent visit to India, the bench asked, "when such heads of government meet, should not such matters be considered at the top level
" ‚Äô‚Äô adaalat ne kendra se kaha ki vah teen saptaah ke bheetar yah pataa lagaae ki in kaidiyon ko unke desh waapas bhejne ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he? nyaayalay ne agali sunwaayee kii taarikh do may mukarrar kar di
 "there is no doubt that these prisoners are being provided with the best facilities while being detained, but the problem is why they are not being sent back," the bench said
 rukaawat kya he? unhen is tarah se rakhaa janaa ‚Äò‚Äòhamen dukh detaa he
 "these matters should be given top priority," the court said
 vah maansik rup se biimaar hai or gunge bahere hai
 He has completed his sentence
 unhen kuch samasya ke kaaran jail main rakhaa gaya he lekin anishchit kaal ke liye to nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 "the Center argues that these people cannot be sent back until they prove their identity
" tippaniyan To this, the bench said, "after six months or a year, how will you be able to do this, the problem will remain
" aap hamen bataaen ki kya kiya janaa chahie

 bhim singh dwaara daayar janhit yachika kii sunwaayee kar rahaa tha
 In the petition, the court had been requested to give instructions to the Center regarding the repatriation of those Pakistani prisoners who, despite completing their sentence, are still lodged in various jails of the country
 singh ne kaha ki in kaidiyon ke photo kendra dwaara pakistan sarkaar ko die jane chahie taaki unhen vahaan ke akhabaaron main prakashit karwaakar inaki pahchaan sabit kii ja sake kyonki ye log maansik rup se biimaar hai
 The court, however, said that the Center has no problem in instructing the Government of Pakistan to provide photographs of these prisoners, but the Government of Pakistan cannot be compelled to publish these photos
 peeth ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòkendra pakistan ucchayog ko majaboor nahin kar saktaa
 Only a few suggestions can be made
