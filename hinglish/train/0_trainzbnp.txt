 The program of Rashtriya Swayamsevak to be held every year in Nagpur on Dussehra was broadcast on Doordarshan today
 subah sabase pehle jhaanki dikhaai gai, iske baad sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat kaa bhaashan lagaataar dikhaaya gaya, jisamen sangh pramukh ne apane vichaaron ko rakhaa
 It is evident that these views are of the National self-service Association
 aise main kya mohan bhagwat kaa yah bhaashan rashtriya channel doordarshan par prasaarit hona thik he
 There are question marks on this
 kya kisi sanghathan ke kaarykram ko prasaarit karne ke liye doordarshan ke paas koi maanak hai
 Also the question on what basis this program of RSS aired on Doordarshan
 aise main sawaal yah bhi he ki kya desh ke duusare dharmik-saanskrithik sanghathanon ke kaaryakramon kaa prasaaran bhi doordarshan karegaa
 After all, what is the criterion, on the basis of which this program of the Sangh aired
 beete das saalon se desh main upie kii sarkaar thi, kabhi bhi aresas pramukh ke kaarykram kaa prasaaran doordarshan par nahin hua tha or isse pehle bhi jab bijepi kii sarkaar centre main thi tab bhi doordarshan par is kaarykram kaa is tarah prasaaran nahin hua tha
 On the other hand, Congress and Left parties strongly criticized the 'misuse' of Doordarshan, but BJP defended it
 congress pravaktaa sandip dikshit ne kareeb ghante bhar ke is prasaaran ko ek ‘khatarnaak parampara’ bataate hue kaha ki aresas ek vivaadaaspad sanghathan he
 He said, this is a dangerous tradition
 yah koi aisa sanghathan nahin he, jo puri tarah se nishpaksh ho
 It is a controversial organization
 unhone kaha ki yah sarkaar kaa ek raajnneetik faisla he
 Congress leader and former Union Minister Salman Khurshid said that in the matter of our national aspirations we do not consider the record of RSS as beyond doubt
 makapa ne kaha, aresas is avasar kaa istemaal apni hindutv kii vichaardhaara ko failaane ke liye karti he
 The national public broadcaster should not have aired the speech of the head of an organization like RSS
 bhartiya communist party ne bhi bhagwat ke bhaashan ko sidhaa prasaarit kiye jane kii ninda kii or kaha ki yah sarkari prasarak kaa durupyog he
 CPI general secretary d Raja said that the government and especially the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting should give an explanation to the public for allowing Doordarshan to become the RSS headpiece
 bhagwat ke bhaashan ke prasaaran kaa bachaav karte hue bhaajapa kii shina en si ne kaha ki aresas ek maatr rashtravaadi sanghathan he, jo bharat sabase pehle (india first) main vishwaas karata he or saath hi desh ko vyaktigat hit se upar maanata he
 On this controversy, Doordarshan said that it was broadcast like other news programs and no special arrangements were made for it
 doordarshan kii mahanideshak archana dutt ne kaha, yah hamaare liye mahaj kisi anya samachar se jude kaarykram kii tarah hi tha
 So we covered it
 dutt ne kaha ki is samaaroh ke liye koi vishesh vyavastha nahin kii gai thi or rajya main chunaav ko cover karne ke liye upyog kiye ja rahe kai digital satellite news gadering vine (dsenji) main se ek kaa upyog is samaaroh ke liye kiya gaya

 The article printed on Monday focused on the politics of Maharashtra to the politics of the Center
 shivasena ne sarkaar 'giraane' vaali samskruti par bhi hamalaa kiya he or poocha he ki bijepi kii yah bhashaa or kab tak chalegi
 The editorial begins with Devendra Fadnavis and his claim in which he claims to have won 43 of the total 48 seats in Maharashtra
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki 'maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke aatmbal kii jitani prashansa kii jaae wo kam hi he
 In Pune in the presence of BJP national president Amit Shah, Fadnavis has raised the slogan that 'we had won 42 seats in Maharashtra during the last Lok Sabha election
 is baar ham kisi bhi haalat main 43 siten jeetenge
 'fadnavis also claims that this time we will defeat Pawar in Baramati

 upi ke rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan aakhri vakt main gachha dene ke chalate raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya se sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke 17 saal puraane rishte puri tarah se bikhar chuke hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BSP President Mayawati has become even stronger against Akhilesh Yadav's brother Raja Bhaiya
 sapa adhyaksh ne raja bhaiya ke durg kahe jane vaale kunda main guuruuvaar ko ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue unpar tikhe hamale kiye or kaha ki unke liye sapa ke daravaaje hameshaa ke liye band ho gaye hai
 Please tell that Raja Bhaiya has fielded two candidates from his party Jansatta Dal Loktantrik from Pratapgarh and Kaushambi Lok Sabha seats
 pratapgarh se akshay pratap singh urf gopal or kaushambi se shailendra kumaar hai
 Both these leaders have been mps from the SP and have currently entered the electoral fray from Raja Bhaiya's Jansatta Party
 raja bhaiya kii party kaa chunaav nishaan 'footbal kheltaa hua khilaadi' he
 Without naming Raja Bhaiya, Akhilesh targeted the election trail of his party and said that if you want to play football, play with us and not with the people of Kunda
 footbal ke khel main unhen aisa nachaayenge ki pataa nahin lagegaa kahaan chale gaye
 The government is going to be formed in 2022, then they will be accounted correctly
 sapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki ham bhi to footbal ke khilaadi hai, khel len hamaare saath
 If we do not beat by ten goals, we are not even cycling
 akhilesh ne kaha ki kshatriyon ke liye ek puraani kahawat he, 'raghukul reet sadaa chal ai, praan jaaen par vachan naa jaae
 But his word (raja Bhaiya) was gone
 kaise log hai, jinka vachan hi chalaa gaya
 a man who lies, there can be no worse man than this
 'sapa pramukh ne kaha ki vaada kiya tha ki vot denge, pataa nahin wo vachan kahaan dhwast ho gaya, kahaan ud gaya or jab vachan ud gaya to hamane bhi tay kar liya ki jaaen, jahaan janaa chahen
 This Samajwadi Party will not open doors for him (raja Bhaiya) again
 ye nai samaajawaadee party he
 It will not open the door again
 akhilesh yadav ne piem modi or siem yogi par jubaani hamalaa bolte hue raja bhaiya ko bhi nishane par liya
 He said that not only the watchman, you also have to remove the chowkidar
 suna he yahaan ek dhamkeedaar bhi hai
 When the janitor is not known, the janitor is not known, then where will the threaten be
 'darasal pichley saal rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan raja bhaiya ne basapa ke ummidavaar ko vot nahin diya tha
 While Akhilesh Yadav hoped that Raja Bhaiya would vote for the BSP at his behest, but did not do so
 isi ke baad donon netaaon ke bich rishte bighad gaye
 However Raja Bhaiya has come close to the SP since 2002
 upi main basapa kii sarkaar bani or mayawati ne mukhyamantri rahete hue raja bhaiya ke khilaaf karrwai karte hue unhen jail bhej diya tha
 After this, the SP raised its voice on this issue
 iske baad raja bhaiya sapa ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh mulaayam singh ke kareeb aae
 After this he became a minister in Mulayam Singh's government
 iske baad 2012 main jab akhilesh yadav mukhyamantri bane to phir raja bhaiya ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Raja Bhaiya has been winning as an Independent MLA
 haalanki sapa ne 2002 ke baad se unke saamne kabhi apana pratyaashee khadaa nahin kiya he

 The death of Subhash Chandra Bose has always been surrounded by controversies
 logon ko bhi samaj nahin aayaa ki aakhirkaar bose kahaan gaayab ho gaye
 Today is Netaji's 121st birthday
 unka janm 23 janvari 1897 main hua tha
 The death of Netaji remains 121 years after his birth, the biggest mystery in the history of India
 unki rahasyamayi maut par samay-samay par kai tarah kii atakalein saamne aati rahi
 When Queen Victoria of Britain sat down giving her heart to the servant
 
 
 jaane unki maut se judi ye baat
 
 
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose died in a plane crash on 18 August 1945 in Taipei
 lekin kya unki sach main mrityu hui thi, ye gutthi sulajh nahin saki
 According to media reports, the matter of Netaji's death was again raised when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit gave a statement in the media
 unhone kaha tha ki mere paas aisi khabar he ki hindustan main tahalaka much jayega
 Perhaps even bigger news than independence
 lekin nehru ne unako manaa kar diya kuch bhi kehane se
 Yeh Bose, who was the Indian son-in-law of Japan, had got the second highest award was seen as being associated with the issue because she was appointed as an Indian Ambassador in Russia at the time
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone subhash chandra bose ko rus main dekha bhi tha
 Vijaya gave this information to the then government, but nothing was done in this matter

 However, a Japanese institution released the news on August 23 of the same year that Netaji's plane had crashed in Taiwan, causing his death
 lekin iske kuch din baad khud japan sarkaar ne is baat kii pushti kii thi ki 18 agast, 1945 ko taiwan main koi vimaan haadasa nahin hua tha
 Therefore even today the mystery of Netaji's death has not been revealed

 kai binduon par donon ekamat bhi hai, magar kai jagahon par asahmat, lekin khulkar kehane kii jagah apni baat rakhane kii style main ye sab pratikriyaayein mukhar ho rahi hai
 In Chandigarh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that "yoga is for the believer, also for the atheist
 
 
 yoga dharmik gatividhi nahin he
 
 
 "there should not be controversy about this
 ummid he, ab koi geruadhari pravaktaa pradhanmantri yaa sadguru jaggi vasudev jaise diggajon ke peeche padane kii himmat nahin dikhayega or doum darje kii bhadakaau bahes karne vaale channelon ko bhi sandesh jayega
 Now no one will say who the Sadguru or Prime Minister is, who will say that Yoga is not religious, not Hindu, and is not Indian anymore
 ham to do saal se galaa fadkar ise hindu dharm, hindu samskruti ke utthan prachaar se jod rahe hai or ab kaise maan len ki yoga dharmik nahin he
 This message should go to such people
 pichley saal yoga diwas ke maukey par NDTV ke manish kumaar se baat karte hue swami niranjananand ji ne aisi hi baat kahi thi
 There is no need to tell about Bihar School of Yoga in Munger
 manish ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main niranjananand ji ne kaha tha ki "yoga jivan style he
 
 
 Although many people may get confused about it being linked from religion to culture and start calling it a part of Hinduism, but those who know about yoga accept that yoga is a culture in itself, With the help of which we can achieve excellence in every activity of our life
 
 
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki "yoga kaa koi dharm nahin
 
 
 " pehle saal main in baton ko nahin suna gaya, lekin kya duusare saal main thik se suna ja sakegaa
 
 
 The As soon as Yoga Day arrives, disputes arise from Surya Namaskar to 'oom'
 ek puraa brigade he, jo surya namaskara ko lekar bavaal rachataa rahata he
 Governments also keep a ban on Surya Namaskar in schools, while Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev says that "yoga is neither the worship of the body nor of the sun

 ise shaareerik chusti ke abhyaas tak simit kar dena utana hi dukhad he, jitna ise dharmik siddhant bataanaa
 
 
 " ek guru kehete hai ki yoga shaareerik abhyaas maatr nahin he
 Niranjananand ji said, the rugs that we consider yoga are only one-tenth of yoga, 90 percent of the rest is ahead of yoga, but the Prime Minister says on the contrary that no health insurance is available in zero budget, but yoga Assures health in zero budget
 ek taraf shunya bajet kii baat karte hai, phir yah bhi kehete hai ki vishwa main yoga bada kaarobaar banataa ja rahaa he
 Every country in the world needs a yoga trainer
 yoga arabon-kharbon kaa kaam ho gaya he
 Yoga also provides health insurance in zero budget and also generates billions and trillions of business
 kya in baton main antarvirodh nahin he
 
 
 The Although it is very good that yoga should be a means of generating employment , but to give the message that yoga is something freely available, i think the Prime Minister should reconsider his talk
 bina teacher ke sabake liye yoga karnaa sambhav nahin hota
 Many yoga teachers have a fee for yoga camps
 bade-bade guruon ne yoga ke package banaae hai, jo kaaphi mahange hai, isliye yoga ko lekar bhi vahi antar he, jo samaaj main anya baton ko lekar he
 Yoga is available only to those who have money
 pradhanmantri kii swasthya beemaa, fitness or welnes kii guarantee vaali baat or sadguru jaggi vasudev, swami niranjananand ji kii baton main itnaa antar kyon he
 Guru ji, why are people saying that yoga should not be included in fitness, why the Prime Minister is repeatedly incorporating it into fitness and wellness
 sahi baat yah he ki yoga ab sirf yoga nahin rahaa, yah dharmik, raajnneetik package kaa hissaa ban chukaa he
 The Prime Minister also said that yoga is not the way to attain, it is the path to liberation
 chhodane or dene kaa maarg he
 Today's middle class is strongly attracted to yoga
 use mukti nahin, prapti chahie
 Lifestyle changes not by yoga, but by changes in economic policies
 unke bheetar fansaa maanav yoga se mukti nahin paa saktaa he
 There is one more problem
 kai netaaon or mantriyon ke liye yah nishtha pradarshan or atmprachaar kaa zariyaa bhi ban gaya he
 a photo of Lt
 Governor Kiran Bedi taking a selfie lightens the purpose of Yoga Day
 kiran bedi hi nahin, tamaam aamajan bhi yoga ke baad selfi ke liye pradhanmantri ke paas bhagdad machaane lagate hai
 Not jealous of his popularity, but what is doubtful is that selfie is also a form of psychiatry
 main bhi selfi se pareshaan rahata hum
 If yoga had not reached the people in the past, people would not have got to raise thousands in a stadium today
 acha he ki iskaa or adhik prasar ho rahaa he
 But why did BJP national president Amit Shah's posters get in the way of Ramdev's program in Faridabad
 yoga jab dharmik nahin he, bhartiya nahin he, to yah raajnneetik kaise hone laga
 When our correspondent Amitoj asked Ramdev, he said that this is people's affection
 par baba kyon nahin kah sake ki phir to yoga fail he
 If you cannot postpone your professional and political practices while doing yoga, then tell me how thousands of people would have been able to achieve the solitude of yoga in Hajj and Hull in a stadium
 raajnneetik poster lagane waalon kii niyat yoga main thi yaa prachaar main thi
 Governments from the Center to the state have spent crores of rupees on yoga advertising
 mujhe vyaktigat rup se tivi ke liye bana asana kaa vigyaapan kahin zyada sarthak or aakarshak laga, lekin zyaadaatar vigyaapan apni sarthakata sabit karne laayak nahin the
 The full emphasis goes to a week-long advertisement on the pretext of organizing one day
 iske bajaay asana ke vigyaapan ko saal bhar chalaanaa chahie, jo behatar tareeke se banaae gaye hai
 The government should reconsider what it wanted to achieve additionally by sending more than 50 ministers to different places
 kya yah kaam yogaguru nahin kar sakate the, koi yoga shikshak nahin kar saktaa tha
 Whether or not the presence of ministers was making yoga official
 yoga agar saadagi kaa aacharan he, to phir yoga diwas ke maukey par bhavyata or nishtha kaa pradarshan kyon hota he
 Some ministers and leaders advocating yoga seem fit, seeing the rest of the body, do not think that they should be doing yoga properly
 zaruri he ki sarkaar ke mantri khud ko yoga main daksh karen
 They should keep in mind that they are going to be representatives of yoga, not ministers
 sharir ko chust banaaen or aacharan main saadagi laaen
 If Yoga gives courage to tell the truth and their belief is in Yoga, then they should tell the truth even if the ministerial post goes away
 Comments yoga antarvirodhon ko paidaa karne kaa madhyam nahin he, balki saadhane kaa abhyaas he
 All of our lives are surrounded by contradictions
 jitna sarkaar kaa, utana hi patrkaar kaa he
 i do yoga myself
 aasapaas halki-si awaz bhi yoga se dhyaan bhatka detii he
 If the stadium, the park, and the dancing and singing programs with Kailash Kher can be proved to be the sum, then what to say and whom
 behatar he, janata ke itane paise kharch karne baad yoga karne ke liye kaha ja rahaa he, to kar liya jaae
 
 
 You will not regret it
 
 
 yoga ke bare main tamaam tikaaon ko padhie
 One to one guru explains that this is a lifestyle
 pradhanmantri ne thik kaha ki yah tyaag karne ke liye he, magar yah baat unheen kii tamaam aarthik nitiyon se mail nahin khaati
 He has no fault in this, but is it not true that the current economy is based on over-consumption
 hamaari raajnneeti ke sanskaar or isamen lagane vaale dhan kaa zariyaa ve aacharan nahin hai, jinaki vakaalat yoga karata he
 Today, yoga is being identified with politicians
 to sawaal poocha ja saktaa he ki phir raajnneeti main yoga kaa ek bhi lakshan kyon nahin dikhataa
 With the intention of giving up everything, when a leader who goes to the daily field of politics, why is he vying to get everything
 'times of india' ke spiking tree kollam main sadguru jaggi vasudev ne yah baat kii he
 Speaking on Yoga Day at the United Nations, Sadguru also said that "yoga is not Indian
 
 
 agar aap aisa sochate hai to aapako yah bhi sochna chahie ki gurutvkarshan europea he
 
 
 " aisa lag rahaa he, yoga kii vyakhya ko lekar kuch yogaguruon or pradhanmantri ke bich vaicharik sangharsh chal rahaa he
 Both are unanimous in many points, but disagree in many places, but all these reactions are being vocal in the style of speaking out rather than saying openly
 chandigarh main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki "yoga aastik ke liye bhi he, naastik ke liye bhi he
 
 
 Yoga is not a religious activity
 
 
 " ise lekar vivaad nahin hona chahie
 Hopefully, now no ocher spokesperson will dare to fall behind the giants like the Prime Minister or Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev, and will also send a message to the channels that have been promoting provocative debates
 ab koi yah nahin kahegaa ki sadguru yaa pradhanmantri koun hote hai yah kehane vaale ki yoga dharmik nahin he, hindu nahin he, or to or bhartiya nahin he
 We have been tearing the throat for two years and associating it with the upliftment of Hindu religion, Hindu culture, and now how to believe that yoga is not religious
 aise logon ko yah sandesh chalaa janaa chahie
 Last year, Swami Niranjananandji had said the same thing while talking to Manish Kumar of NDTV on the occasion of Yoga Day
 munger ke bihar skool of yoga ke bare main bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 In response to a question by Manish, Niranjananand Ji had said that “yoga is a lifestyle
 
 
 haalanki kai log ise dharm se lekar samskruti tak se jode jane ko lekar bhramit ho sakate hai or ise hindu dharm kaa hissaa bataane lagate hai, lekin jo yoga ke bare main jaanate hai, ve sweekaar karte hai ki yoga apane aap main ek samskruti he, jisaki madad se ham apane jivan kii har gatividhi main shreshthata hasil kar sakate hai
 
 
 "he also said that" Yoga has no religion
 
 
 " These things were not heard in the first year, but will be heard properly in the second year
 
 
 ? yoga diwas ke aate hi surya namaskara se lekar 'uun' ko lekar vivaad paidaa kiye jane lagate hai
 There is a whole brigade, which creates a ruckus about Surya Namaskar
 sarkarein bhi skulon main surya namaskara kii pabandi tay karti rahati hai, jabaki sadguru jaggi vasudev kehete hai ki "yoga na to sharir kii puja he, na surya kii
 
 
 Restricting it to the practice of physical fitness is as sad as calling it religious doctrine
 
 
 " a guru says that yoga is not merely a physical practice
 niranjananand ji ne kaha, ham jin asana ko yoga samajhate hai, ve yoga kaa sirf dasvaan hissaa hai, baaki kaa 90 fisadi yogasana se aage he, lekin pradhanmantri to thik iske vipareet kehete hai ki shunya bajet main koi swasthya beemaa nahin miltaa, lekin yoga shunya bajet main swasthya kaa aashwaasan detaa he
 On the one hand, we talk about zero budget, then it is also said that yoga is becoming a big business in the world
 duniya ke har desh main yoga trainer kii zarurat he
 Yoga has become a work of billions and trillions
 yoga shunya bajet main swasthya beemaa bhi detaa he or arabon-kharbon kaa kaarobaar bhi paidaa kar detaa he
 Is there no contradiction in these things? 
 
 ? vaise bahut acha he ki yoga rojgaar paidaa karne kaa zariyaa bane, lekin yah sandesh dena ki yoga koi muft main uplabdh chiz he, mujhe lagata he ki pradhanmantri ko apni baton par phir se vichaar karnaa chahie
 It is not possible for everyone to do yoga without a teacher
 kai yogaguruon ke yoga shiviron ke liye baqayada fees lagati he
 Big gurus have made packages of yoga, which are quite expensive, so there is the same difference about yoga, which is about other things in the society
 jiske paas paisa he, yoga usee ke liye uplabdh he
 Why is there such a difference between the Prime Minister's talk about health insurance, fitness and wellness, and the talk of Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev, Swami Niranjananandji
 guru ji log kyon kah rahe hai ki yoga ko fitness main mat sametie, pradhanmantri kyon baar-baar ise fitness or welnes main samet rahe hai
 The right thing is that yoga is no longer just yoga, it has become part of the religious, political package
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yoga paane kaa maarg nahin he, mukti kaa maarg he
 There is a way to leave and give
 aaj kaa madhyamvarg yoga ke prati jamkar aakarshith hua he
 He should not attain salvation
 jivan style yoga se nahin, aarthik nitiyon main parivartan se badalati he
 Human yoga trapped within them cannot be liberated
 ek samasya or he
 For many leaders and ministers, it has also become a means of loyalty and self-propaganda
 uparajyapal kiran bedi kii selfi leti hui tasviir yoga diwas ke makasad ko halkaa karti he
 Not only Kiran Bedi, all the common people also go on a rampage with the Prime Minister for a selfie after yoga
 unki lokapriyata se irshyaa nahin he, magar isamen kya shaq he ki selfi manorog kaa rup bhi he
 i also get annoyed with selfies
 pehle se yoga jan-jan main nahin pahunchaa hota, to aaj kisi stadium main hazaron kii sankhya main jutaney ke liye log nahin milte
 It is good that it is spreading more
 magar faridabad main ramdev ke kaarykram ke raste main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke poster kyon lage the
 When Yoga is not religious, not Indian, then how did it become political
 hamaare samvaadadaata amitoj ne jab ramdev se poocha to kehane lage ki yah to logon kaa sneh he
 But why Baba could not say that then yoga has failed
 agar yoga karte samay aap apane vyavsaayik or raajnneetik aacharnon ko sthagit nahin kar sakate to phir aap bataaie, ek stadium main hazaron logon hajahaj or halchal main yoga kaa ekant kaise hasil kar sake honge
 The intentions of those putting up political posters were in yoga or publicity
 centre se lekar rajya sarkaron ne yoga vigyaapan par karodon rupee kharch kiye hai
 i personally found the advertising of rugs made for TV far more meaningful and attractive, but most advertisements were not worth proving their worth
 puraa jor ek din ke aayojan ke bahaane hafte bhar ke vigyaapan kaa ho jaataa he
 Instead, the advertisement of rugs should run throughout the year, which is better made
 sarkaar ko punarvichaar karnaa chahie ki 50 se adhik mantriyon ko alag-alag jagahon par bhejkar vah atirikt rup se kya hasil karnaa chaahati thi
 Could this not be done by a yoga teacher, a yoga teacher could not
 mantriyon ko maujuudagi yoga ko sarkari bana rahi thi yaa nahin
 If yoga is a practice of simplicity, then why is grandeur and loyalty displayed on the occasion of Yoga Day
 yoga kii vakaalat karne vaale kuch mantri or netaa feet lagate hai, baaki ke sharir dekhakar lagata nahin ki thik se yoga karte bhi honge
 It is important that the ministers of the government should master themselves in yoga
 unhen dhyaan rakhana chahie ki ve yoga ke pratinidhi banakar ja rahe hai, mantri nahin
 Make the body fit and bring simplicity in conduct
 yoga agar satya kehane kaa saahas detaa he or unka yakeen yoga main he, to unhen satya hi kahana chahie, bhale hi mantri pad chalaa jaae!tippaniyan Yoga is not a means of creating contradictions, but a practice of cultivation
 ham sabakaa jivan antarvirodhon se ghira he
 As much as the government, it belongs to the journalist
 main khud yoga karata hum
 Even the slightest sound distracts meditation from yoga
 stadium, park or kailash kher ke saath gaate-naachte hue kaaryakramon ko agar yoga sabit kiya ja saktaa he, to phir kya kaha jaae or kise kaha jaae
 It is better that after spending so much money, people are asked to do yoga, then it should be done
 
 
 aapako afsos nahin hoga
 
 
 Read all the commentaries about yoga
 ek se ek guru bataate hai ki yah jeevanstyli he
 The Prime Minister rightly said that this is for renunciation, but this does not match his economic policies
 isamen unka koi dosha nahin, magar kya yah sach nahin he ki maujuuda arthvyavastha atiupbhog par hi aadhaarit he
 The means of the rites of our politics and the money involved in it are not the practices that yoga advocates
 aaj kii taarikh main yoga kii pahchaan rajanetaaon se hoti ja rahi he
 So the question can be asked, why does not a single sign of yoga appear in politics
 sab kuch chhod dene kii manshaa se yoga karne vaala netaa jab raajnneeti ke dainik maidan main jaataa he, to sab kuch paane kii hode main kyon lag jaataa he
 It seems, there is an ideological struggle between some yogis and the Prime Minister over the interpretation of Yoga
 kai binduon par donon ekamat bhi hai, magar kai jagahon par asahmat, lekin khulkar kehane kii jagah apni baat rakhane kii style main ye sab pratikriyaayein mukhar ho rahi hai
 In Chandigarh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that "yoga is for the believer, also for the atheist

 pichley saal yoga diwas ke maukey par NDTV ke manish kumaar se baat karte hue swami niranjananand ji ne aisi hi baat kahi thi
 There is no need to tell about Bihar School of Yoga in Munger

 yoga shunya bajet main swasthya beemaa bhi detaa he or arabon-kharbon kaa kaarobaar bhi paidaa kar detaa he
 Is there no contradiction in these things? 
 
 ? vaise bahut acha he ki yoga rojgaar paidaa karne kaa zariyaa bane, lekin yah sandesh dena ki yoga koi muft main uplabdh chiz he, mujhe lagata he ki pradhanmantri ko apni baton par phir se vichaar karnaa chahie
 It is not possible for everyone to do yoga without a teacher
 kai yogaguruon ke yoga shiviron ke liye baqayada fees lagati he
 Big gurus have made packages of yoga, which are quite expensive, so there is the same difference about yoga, which is about other things in the society
 jiske paas paisa he, yoga usee ke liye uplabdh he
 Why is there such a difference between the Prime Minister's talk about health insurance, fitness and wellness, and the talk of Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev, Swami Niranjananandji
 guru ji log kyon kah rahe hai ki yoga ko fitness main mat sametie, pradhanmantri kyon baar-baar ise fitness or welnes main samet rahe hai
 The right thing is that yoga is no longer just yoga, it has become part of the religious, political package
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yoga paane kaa maarg nahin he, mukti kaa maarg he
 There is a way to leave and give
 aaj kaa madhyamvarg yoga ke prati jamkar aakarshith hua he
 He should not attain salvation
 jivan style yoga se nahin, aarthik nitiyon main parivartan se badalati he
 Human yoga trapped within them cannot be liberated
 ek samasya or he
 For many leaders and ministers, it has also become a means of loyalty and self-propaganda
 uparajyapal kiran bedi kii selfi leti hui tasviir yoga diwas ke makasad ko halkaa karti he
 Not only Kiran Bedi, all the common people also go on a rampage with the Prime Minister for a selfie after yoga
 unki lokapriyata se irshyaa nahin he, magar isamen kya shaq he ki selfi manorog kaa rup bhi he
 i also get annoyed with selfies
 pehle se yoga jan-jan main nahin pahunchaa hota, to aaj kisi stadium main hazaron kii sankhya main jutaney ke liye log nahin milte
 It is good that it is spreading more
 magar faridabad main ramdev ke kaarykram ke raste main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke poster kyon lage the
 When Yoga is not religious, not Indian, then how did it become political
 hamaare samvaadadaata amitoj ne jab ramdev se poocha to kehane lage ki yah to logon kaa sneh he
 But why Baba could not say that then yoga has failed
 agar yoga karte samay aap apane vyavsaayik or raajnneetik aacharnon ko sthagit nahin kar sakate to phir aap bataaie, ek stadium main hazaron logon hajahaj or halchal main yoga kaa ekant kaise hasil kar sake honge
 The intentions of those putting up political posters were in yoga or publicity
 centre se lekar rajya sarkaron ne yoga vigyaapan par karodon rupee kharch kiye hai
 i personally found the advertising of rugs made for TV far more meaningful and attractive, but most advertisements were not worth proving their worth
 puraa jor ek din ke aayojan ke bahaane hafte bhar ke vigyaapan kaa ho jaataa he
 Instead, the advertisement of rugs should run throughout the year, which is better made
 sarkaar ko punarvichaar karnaa chahie ki 50 se adhik mantriyon ko alag-alag jagahon par bhejkar vah atirikt rup se kya hasil karnaa chaahati thi
 Could this not be done by a yoga teacher, a yoga teacher could not
 mantriyon ko maujuudagi yoga ko sarkari bana rahi thi yaa nahin
 If yoga is a practice of simplicity, then why is grandeur and loyalty displayed on the occasion of Yoga Day
 yoga kii vakaalat karne vaale kuch mantri or netaa feet lagate hai, baaki ke sharir dekhakar lagata nahin ki thik se yoga karte bhi honge
 It is important that the ministers of the government should master themselves in yoga
 unhen dhyaan rakhana chahie ki ve yoga ke pratinidhi banakar ja rahe hai, mantri nahin
 Make the body fit and bring simplicity in conduct
 yoga agar satya kehane kaa saahas detaa he or unka yakeen yoga main he, to unhen satya hi kahana chahie, bhale hi mantri pad chalaa jaae!tippaniyan Yoga is not a means of creating contradictions, but a practice of cultivation
 ham sabakaa jivan antarvirodhon se ghira he
 As much as the government, it belongs to the journalist
 main khud yoga karata hum
 Even the slightest sound distracts meditation from yoga
 stadium, park or kailash kher ke saath gaate-naachte hue kaaryakramon ko agar yoga sabit kiya ja saktaa he, to phir kya kaha jaae or kise kaha jaae
 It is better that after spending so much money, people are asked to do yoga, then it should be done
 
 
 aapako afsos nahin hoga
 
 
 Read all the commentaries about yoga
 ek se ek guru bataate hai ki yah jeevanstyli he
 The Prime Minister rightly said that this is for renunciation, but this does not match his economic policies
 isamen unka koi dosha nahin, magar kya yah sach nahin he ki maujuuda arthvyavastha atiupbhog par hi aadhaarit he
 The means of the rites of our politics and the money involved in it are not the practices that yoga advocates
 aaj kii taarikh main yoga kii pahchaan rajanetaaon se hoti ja rahi he
 So the question can be asked, why does not a single sign of yoga appear in politics
 sab kuch chhod dene kii manshaa se yoga karne vaala netaa jab raajnneeti ke dainik maidan main jaataa he, to sab kuch paane kii hode main kyon lag jaataa he
 Why is there such a difference between the Prime Minister's talk about health insurance, fitness and wellness, and the talk of Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev, Swami Niranjananandji
 guru ji log kyon kah rahe hai ki yoga ko fitness main mat sametie, pradhanmantri kyon baar-baar ise fitness or welnes main samet rahe hai

 Slowly the mist sorted
 unhone kamayani (jaishankar prasad), rashmirathi (dinakar) or pancharatram (bhaas) jaise clasik / ahm text ko 1-1 ghante ke recorded paath, sangeet or jeevant nrity, abhinay kii ek khaas style main pirona, pesh karnaa shuru kar diya
 In this style, Rama's Shaktipooja became a representative of his work, but also an identity
 dilli, patna, kolkata se lekar jabalpur, ujjain or barabanki jaise shaharon ke baad pichley maheene ranchi main uski 50veen prastuti hui
 Narrating the role of a play before a stage is considered to be a rash in the world of theater
 iske baavjood unhone har baar ojayukt, or thodaa dabang, aawaaj main panchek minute kii garimapurna bhoomika se barabas darshakon kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 Vyomesh created a rich soundtrack to underline this great poem of Nirala differently

 In the same way, for the expressions of Hanuman seeing his adorable Rama weeping, he used the famous Hanuman Paran of the house of Sitara Devi, the Kathak dancer of Banaras and the classical singer Pt

 Vyomesh has started creating a new audience by moving Shaktipooja and the remaining 3 plays to theater, music festivals and school-colleges

 Shaktipooja was staged at Barabanki near Lucknow and the Khanty Kasbai Deva fair there
 chhattisgarh ke ek sanjeeda samskruthikarmi or kai prastutiyaan kara chuke rahul singh maanate hai ki ''vyomesh ras or lay ke mail se apni prastutiyon main gaharaa saundaryabodh bharte hai
 Underlining new meanings in old classics, he has made them go beyond books and read interestingly on stage
 ''par! kya ye natya prastutiyaan hai? yah sawaal vyomesh kii rachanaatmakataa ko najadik se dekhte-samajhate aae ankur hi uthaate hai
 In his words, "radio drama has more influence on Shaktipooja
" isamen naatak kahaan he? bahut kharaab prastuti he
 Vyomesh should not be in a hurry
 '' lekin hindi rangamanch ke sheersh naamon main se ek bansi kaul is bahes ko bemaani tehra dete hai
 "vyomesh's play meets dance drama, but that too theater
" vah guladaste main ek nayaa rang lekar aa rahaa he, hamaare liye nae darshak bana rahaa he
 And in the theater of Ankur's story, if two people stand up and say the dialogue, it will be a drama? unki kuch kavitaaon par bhi gadhy hone kii bahes chhid gai thi
 Actually Viomesh's creative discomfort has brought him to the theater
 or unki taiyaariyaan dekh lagata he, yahaan ve tikenge
 Son Tapas (15) and daughter Sakhi (7) are playing the role of Hanuman in Shaktipooja
 haal hi unhen paanch kalakaaron kii natya mandali ke liye samskruti mantralay se grant bhi mil gai he

 In the room of Mumtaz Christ, now Congress state president Sachin Pilot's close vice-president Gopal Singh Idwa will sit
 aaj subah jab achaanak mumtaj messiah daftar pahunche to unke naam kaa unke kamare ke baahar se hataa tha or kamare ke andar gopal singh idwa baithe hue the
 The name plate of Mumtaz Christ's name was replaced by the name plate of the senior vice president

 Idwa said that it should not be exaggerated

 He is the Senior Vice President, as this room has been given to us, all the other Vice Presidents will sit in one room
 sabhi aath upaadhyaksh bagal ke bade kamare main ek saath baithenge
 However Mumtaz Christ also said that he is working with Sachin Pilot and has a good relationship with them
 lihaaja main samajhataa hum ki unhone kuch soch kar hi baithne kii vyavastha nae sire se kii hogi magar mumtaj messiah apana gam chupa nahin paae or kehane lage ki pichley 20 varshon se main us kamare main baith rahaa tha

 mahendra ek behtareen painter bhi hai or ve kai netaaon kii painting banaakar unhen bhent kar chuke hai
 According to Mahendra Pramanik, a wonderful introduction to art, poverty and the compulsion to run a family forced him to keep his art alive in the saloon, once a canvas-clad Mahendra now spreads his fingers through his scissors and comb
 mahendra kehete hai ki jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantriyon se unhone art college main admician dilaane kii guhaar lagaai thi
 But he did not achieve success, then due to the compulsion to walk home, he started spending more time in the salon and keeping his art alive in the salon itself

 Saeed also alleged that India and America do not want the Pak government to talk to the Taliban
 usne kaha ki ye donon mulk hamaari shanti ke khilaaf hai
 It is worth mentioning that Hafiz Saeed formed the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba in the nineties
 yahi aatankwaadi sanghathan disambar 2001 main bhartiya sansad par hamale ke liye jimmedaar tha
 The same organization carried out the 26 / 11 terrorist attack in Mumbai

 For the rest of the story, use Google Baba
 abhi baat ravichand bhai kii
 In those days, he used to work in electricity in a Surat company
 ek din sidhiyon se phisal kar bijli ke nange taar par gir pade
 According to the doctors, both arms had to be amputated
 aath hajaar rupee main aaraam se chal rahi jindagi ne bistar pakad liya
 Two days of bread have passed for wife and young children, but where were they going to give up
 ve phir se uth khadey hue
 Bicycle made a tool of employment
 
 
 ravichand bhai vaise to pehle bhi cycle chalaaya karte the lekin ab paristhitiyaan ekadam vipareet thim
 Where were they even going to give up? chaar maheene se kone main phenki gai cycle ko sir par uthaaya or bazaar ke liye chal die
 The iron handle was placed in the handle of the bicycle in such a way that they could hold both their hands in it
 brake ko pairon kii jagah lagavaaya taaki jarurat padane par brake laga saken
 Now they work everyday from 9 am to evening taking goods from big shops to small shops
 ve hameshaa apni cycle par ek bada thilaa aage or chaar bade thile peeche lekar chalate dikh jate hai
 The fire within them is still the fire of passion and passion for many
 ek baar netaji se bhid pade
 
 
 When a man is so belligerent, it is obvious that he listened to anyone
 kisi kaa bhi ahsaan lene se rahaa
 It was some five years ago
 vot ke liye cycle, mobile or laptop baantne ke vaade phija main tair rahe the
 One Netaji's eye was also on Ravichand Bhai
 unhone ravichand bhai ko 'viklang' ghoshit karte hue betry vaala rickshaw dene kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Would have thought that by creating an atmosphere, votes can be collected, but this time, Ravichand had fallen with his brother
 ravichand bhai ne bhibliatic andaajamen pagadi baandhi or lapakkar netaji ke paas pahunch gaye
 Eyeing Netaji's eyes, he said - a Netaji! Neither will i say disabled, nor will i make a ballot box by hanging it here
 aaie na cycle res kar lijie, dekhie to koun jeetta he
 Whether it is or not, but he is the winner of the race of life
 baliatic pagadi he pahchaan kaa hissaa
 
 
 Although the turbans are tied in many ways, but the style of wearing the turban of Ravichand Bhai is unique
 ve jab anguchhe ko sir par ghuma kar baandhte hai to aisa lagata he jaise kisi ne chupake se unke sir par mukut rakh diya ho
 They ride a bicycle barefoot as if the sun is shaking its own chariot
 jamaane se befikar or apni hi dhun main
 Cutting the darkness around and presenting a vision for desperate people to rise again
 ab ham to bas yahi dua karenge ki ve yun hi swasth bane rahen or puri duniya main sakaaraatmakataa kaa pravaah barkaraar rakhen

 Team India Test captain Virat Kohli has revealed the reasons for Ravichandran Ashwin's continued success
 nagpur main teesraa test shuru hone se thik ek din pehle unhone bataaya ki aswin pichley ek saal se behtareen pradarshan kar rahe hai or iske peeche unka basics par dhyaan dena or bahut prayog nahin karnaa he
 Ravichandran played a big role in winning the Test series in Ashwinneshrilanka and was the man of the series with 21 wickets in three Tests
 maujuuda siries main bhi wo ab tak 12 wicket le chuke hai
 Virat Kohli said, 'if you have seen his bowling in the last six months, then he has come back to basics
 vah apni gendbaaji main bahut prayog nahin kar rahaa he
 You will rarely see him doing a carrom ball which means he trusts his natural bowling action and stock ball
 ’unhone kaha, ‘vah (aswin) gend ko flite karata he
 He is also strong at the level of fitness which helps him to bowl on important occasions as he is able to put strength behind the ball and this gives him even more bounce on pitches on which other bowlers contend
 ’ It is not difficult to win the battle of speed if 1 car has 5 weapons

 a 200 to 350 kmph speed driver's seating area is called the cockpit
 in kaaron main bhi front or rear wings hote hai
 a plane weighing tons needs a speed of 270 km per hour to fly and these cars race at a speed of 200 to 350 km per hour
 formula van kaaron main twin brake hydrolic braking system kaa istemaal hota he
 The other advantage of this is that even if one circuit fails completely, the braking system of the other circuit is maintained

 Apart from this, there is also a push to talk button connected to the radio system
 stearing wheel ke saath hi alsidi disple screen bhi judaa hota he, jisamen ultra lite singnals driver ko gear change karte vakt behad madadgaar hote hai
 The cost of an F-1 car is Rs 40 crore
 Through the GPS martial system, the driver stays connected with his team, which keeps him informed about the track
 ab aap hi bataaie itani titake car kii keemat kam to nahin hogi, isliye chaunkane kii bilkul jarurat nahin ki
 An F-1 car costs around Rs 40 crore to build, and teams like Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull spend about two hundred million dollars each year on cars

 aap bhi jaananaa chaahate honge ki aakhir aisa kya khaas he in drivers main jo inhen hawa se baaten karne laayak banaata he
 Actually, racing is not as easy as it looks
 res ke dauraan car ke cockpit kaa taapmaana 50 degree celsius tak pahunch jaataa he or driver apane sharir kaa kareeb 4 fisadi pani paseene main baha dete hai
 This is the reason why a driver's weight is reduced by 3-4 kg after one race
 jaise jaise raftaar badhati he, blad pressure bhi badhata jaataa he
 a driver's BP increases by about 50% during a race
 iske saath hi dil kii dhadakanen, ek minute main 60 baar se badhkar 150 se zyada ho jaati hai
 Drivers make full preparations to avoid heat and less body water

 haal hi main microbloging vaibsite twitor ne ek elaan kiya he
 In which he said that a big step has been taken for the convenience of users
 ab jab aap kisi yujar yaa group ko riplai karenge, to @usernames, aapako milane vaali limit 140 kairactor main count nahin honge
 Which will save some characters and you will be able to write more words in your tweet
 yani ab 140 se kuch zyada kairactor main riplai kiya ja saktaa he
 Last year, Twitter announced that the tweet could be 140 characters without any media attachment and @reply
 jisamen pichley saal se hi media atachament twit kii 140 kairactor limit se baahar he
 At the same time, @usernames will also not be added to the 140 character limit from now on
 twitor kaa daawa heki isse na sirf logon ke liye twitor or aasaan ho jayega, balki isse unka yujar base bhi badhegaa
 The move will encourage more people to openly share their talk on Twitter as well as share photos, videos and links
 twitor kaa sabase bada pratidwandi is vakt fasebuk he
 Where Facebook is constantly changing the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, whatsapp
 haal hi main whatsap, massenger or sabase nae kii baat karen to fasebuk ap par bhi instagram kii tarah 24 ghante ke liye apni story lagaae rakhane kaa feechar aayaa he
 In such a situation, Twitter's decision to make these changes in its software looks quite right in terms of competition
 aaj vah khud ko 'raajnneetik krantikari' kehete hai, lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki vah raajnneeti main aaenge, party banaaenge or chunaav ladenge
 Kejriwal said, i never thought that i will come into politics
 pichley maheene kuch pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang karte hue abhootpurv tareeke se dharne par baithe kejariwal ne us samay khud ko 'araajaktaavaadi' kaha tha
 Today, he interprets that remark, arguing that corrupt political and corporate leaders, some bureaucrats and some media people are living happily, while the common man is unhappy
 kejariwal ne kaha, jab ham vyavastha ko badalane kii baat karte hai to in logon ke liye yah araajaktaa main badal jaati he
 To him, yes, i am an anarchist
 yah sawaal kiye jane par ki kya vah khud ko raajnneetik krantikari kahenge, 45-varshiya netaa ne kaha, haa, raajnneetik krantikari, haa
 He was asked what he would say to those who called him a dictator
 is par kejariwal ne kaha, kya aapako lagata he ki prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav jaise log ek taanashaah ke saath kaam kar sakate hai? bahut se log hamaare paas aa rahe hai
 Will they work with a dictator? kejariwal ne kaha ki 'aap' kaa netritv 'samagrata' main rahaa he or yadi ham taanashaah hote to, chaar log bhi hamaare saath khadey nahin hote
 Asked if he ever thought his dreams would go to politics, Kejriwal said that after the party was formed in October 2012, he hoped to do something good, but did not think that he would be the Chief Minister of Delhi

 He said, we have not come here to do power politics
 yah puche jane par ki kya iske baavjood vah pradhanmantri banenge, kejariwal ne kaha, koi bhi bhavishyavaanee kar sakate hai
 Who knows? kejariwal ke liye abhi yah tay nahin he ki vah loksabhaa chunaav ladenge yaa nahin, lekin unhone kaha, yadi jarurat padi, to main chunaav laduunga, lekin meri pehali praathamikta dilli he
 He said that AAP will identify those Lok Sabha constituencies from where corrupt candidates of other parties are contesting elections and we will fight against them
 yah sankhya 150 yaa 200 yaa 250 athwa 350 ho sakati he
 Kejriwal said, we are not saying that our party will form the government at the Center
 
 
 lekin hamaare log jitne adhik sankhya main sansad ke liye nirvaachit honge, utana hi bhrasht logon ke liye mushkil badhegi
 Refusing to comment on Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal said, "I can only say that both are part of the same political system and i don't think you have any hope from both
" kejariwal is maamle main puri tarah spasht the ki loksabhaa chunaav main trishanku faisla aane kii surat main 'aap' kisi raajnneetik dal ke saath nahin jaaegi yaa 'satta kii raajnneeti' main bhagidaar nahin banegi
 The Chief Minister said, we will live, fight and die, you will see
 kejariwal khud ko jaldbaaji vaale mukhyamantri kehalaae jane kaa bura nahin maanate
 He says, i think anyone should be in a hurry
 samay kam he or jindagi choti he
 There are only 24 hours in a day
 yah puche jane par ki satta kii kursi par baithne ke baad unki jindagi main kya badlaav aayaa he, kejariwal ne kaha ki iskaa sabase pehla shikaar unki paariwarik jindagi hui he
 He said, watching movies with family has stopped on Saturday
 kejariwal ke sarkari awaas main koi pados nahin he
 In Ghaziabad, where he had previously lived, his mother and wife used to go out of the house and chat with neighbors

 akhir tamilnadu kii janata ne us hakeekat se saakshaatkaar kar hi liya, jiskaa wo pichley 74 dinon se saamana karne kaa himmat juta hi nahin paa rahi thi
 The courage and generosity that Jayalalithaa's death has been proclaimed by her supporters and the people there, you will find evidence of the peace in the state amidst the sad sadness, which the Tamil Nadu police day and night in fear of dissolution Was standing attentive

 Several lakh people who came to pay their last farewell to Jayalalithaa have given dignity to their death by giving disciplined farewell to their leader

 The TV camera can only show pictures, cannot tell what will be going on in the hearts of those millions

 Amma's supporters made this last journey memorable for a long time in history

 We can understand the difficulty with which the floods of millions must have overcome their emotional boom
 bahut mushkil hota he antim yatra ke vakt kisi shakhsiyat se aapako rubaru karaane kaa
 We understand that Jayalalithaa also built the same stronghold of power on her own behalf, building a fort
 jiske kaayade usee duniya se liye gaye the jisase baghaavat kar wo jayalalita bani thim
 This is not the time for that calculation

 This kind of madness, such trust, nobody else can achieve

 If he gets power then he is the one who is ousted from power

 The Indian Express has published that an official had said that she was beyond caste and religion

 She bathes the actor's poster with milk upon the release of a film
 log use pagal divaana samajhate hai
 The same people leave their leader with such simplicity
 jaankaron ke paas hairat ke alaava koi or shabd nahin he
 We also have to understand the process of the formation of a politician and change from a politician to a hero and a hero
 is tarah kii deewangi, aisa bharosa, koi or hasil nahin kar paata he
 Political protests, insults, accusations, jail, displacement are all a politician
 wo satta paata he to vahi he jo satta se bedakhal kiya jaataa he
 No one other than the politician gives such talk among the public
 isliye rajaneta logon ke dilon main raaj karata he
 Especially those who maintain their confidence in a large section for decades
 vahi log hai jo uttar main lokanayak ban jate hai, dakshin main ammaa ban jate hai
 Some become Bapu, some become leaders
 koi baba sahab ban jaataa he koi koi pandit ji ban jaataa he
 Samudar has faced another Samadar today

 Jayalalithaa somehow sneaks in and stands there for thirteen hours
 aaj usee raja ji haal main jayalalita kaa parthiv sharir rakhaa hua tha
 In a way, the political story starts from where it ends
 niyati main jo yakeen rakhte hai wo is kisse ko jamaane tak yaad rakhenge

 The Minister of Human Resources said that yesterday he only expressed his opinion about this
 12veen se shuru ho sakati he chantniiiti main daakhila paane ke liye ab 12veen ke imtahaan se hi shuru ho sakati he chantni
 The country's Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal is right to bring a similar policy
 12veen main 80 fisadi ank laana jarurisibbal kaa maananaa he ki 12veen main 80 fisadi se kam number paane waalon ko iaiti main daakhile kaa haq nahin milanaa chahie
 Sibal says that we will have a uniform examination system, in which weightage will also be given to the 12th results
 yani sibbal kii maane to agar kisi chaatr kii board pariksha karaab hui to iaiti main daakhila to dur pariksha main baithna bhi naseeb nahin hoga
 75 percent number is also not important, according to the Human Resource Minister, the board exam does not even have the importance of distance i
e
 75 percent number

 Now they are advocating at least 80 percent number for the IIT exam
 aise main sawaal ye he ki kya chaatro kaa tanaav kam hoga
 Kapil Sibal's argument is beyond comprehension
 unka maananaa he ki aisa karne se koching ke badhate kaarobaar par roak lagaai ja sakegi
 These options are suggestions at the moment

 jo hamaare desh main ram kaa nahin wo hamaare kisi kaam kaa nahin’'jo chhuegaa hinduon kii hasti ko, mitaa daalenge uski harek basti korhana he to vahiin murdaastaan banakar raho, aurangzeb, babar bane to khaak main mila denge tumhaari har basti ko’vaise to bihar main ramanavami ke maukey par shobhaayatra nikaalane kaa chalan bahut purana nahin he
 For the last four-five years, such beautiful journeys have been taken out
 vahiin pichley do-ek saal se in shobhaa yatraaon main deje ko pramukhataa se shaamil karne or inke madhyam se aise gane bajaane yaa naare lagane kaa chalan badha he jisamen ek samudaay vishesh ko target kiya jaataa he
 The first clash in Aurangabad district took place on the 25th, a day before the procession was taken out
 ek sthaneey patrkaar naam gopneey rakhane kii shart par bataate hai, ' is din ilaake main motorcycle juluus nikaali gai thi
 There is an Obra Mohalla here
 is mohalle main hindu-muslim donon rahete hai lekin musalamaanon kii aabaadi zyada he
 So it is called Muslim Mohalla
 pichley saal jab muharram kii raily nikali thi is mohalle ke kuch ladke bike se un mohallon main bhi gaye the jahaan hindu zyada rahete hai
 Even then there was a fight
 usee ke jawaab swaroop ramanavami par hindu ladke motorcycle juluus ko obra mohalle main le gaye
 Along with the motorcycle procession, there was a DJ
 is din bhi marpet hui
 In the evening, the police called a meeting of the people of both the communities so that the next day the procession could leave in peace
 When we asked why the DJ was first targeted in Obra locality? If he is damaged, he says, 'there is a reason behind it
 deje par log dharmik gaanaa yaa kahen to ek tarah se bhadakaau gaanaa baja rahe the
 'he further says,' When the procession reached the large mosque located in the main bazaar, there were some Muslim youth on the terrace, after seeing that the boys involved in the procession started frantically
 jai shri ram ke naare or tej ho gaye or isi ke baad chat se ek pathar neeche phenki gai
 After this, the stoning started on seeing
 neeche se logon ne chat par pathar chalaanaa shuru kar diya
 Those who were behind in the journey started setting fire to shops there
 ’darbhanga jile main koi apriy ghatana to nahin ghati lekin yah trend yahaan bhi dekha gaya
 The agility of the local administration controlled the matter before it deteriorated
 darbhanga main bhi ramanavami kii shobhaa yatra nikali thi
 As soon as Shobha Yatra approached the Muslim locality, the song playing with the DJ changed
 gane main jai shri ram ke naare kaa udghosh tha or pakistan murdaabaad tha
 The local administration immediately stopped these songs and normalized the atmosphere by interacting with the people of both the communities after which the procession came out
 is bare main jila ke variya up samahrta (senior Dy
 Collector) Ravindra Kumar Diwakar says, 'the songs being played by djs on such occasions are very objectionable
 duusare samudaay ke logon ko chidhaane jaisaa he
 Slogans of Pakistan Murdabad are raised as soon as they go to Muslim areas
 aisa karnaa kahin se uchit nahin he
 The Muslims of this country are also Indians
 aisa karne vaale unhen yah ehsaas dilaanaa chaahate hai ki wo videshi hai jo ki puri tarah se galat he
 'he adds,' Why are you only blaming songs? The slogans are changed after they move to Muslim areas
 tone badal jaataa he
 Gestures change
 ham aisi kisi bhi harakat ko bardaasht nahin karte
 'we also talked to a senior police officer posted in Bihar about this new trend
 wo bataate hai, 'is tarah ke gane pichley chaar-paanch saal main zyada teji se bane hai
 Technology has made the job easier
 hamaari jaankaree main aise 70 se zyada gane hai
 We have also banned some, but if someone has already downloaded those songs, then we are not able to do anything but the administration has an eye and that is why we also issued an advisory before Ramnavami
 haalanki utyub par aise kai gane abhi bhi hai jo apane-aap main kisi bhi ilaake main danga failaane, sampradayik hinsa failaane ke liye kaaphi ho sakate hai
 The lyrics of some songs are very objectionable
 hamane upar aise kuch gaanon kaa zikr kiya he
 Such Shobha Yatras bring out different organizations in different places, yet the presence of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal is prominently seen in these trips
 is vajah se hamane bihar main vishwa hindu parishad ke sah sanyojak birendra prasad se is babat sawaal kiye
 They have a different opinion about the playing of such songs in Shobha Yatras and taking out the yatra with traditional weapons
 unhone hamase baat karte hue kuch gaanon ko sahi tehraaya to kuch ke bare main kaha ki agar is tarah ke gane market main hai to bajenge hi
 It is the government's job to ban
 vahiin unka kahana he ki jahaan bhi hinsa hui usamen duusare samudaay ke logon kii hi galati he
 Bihar's senior journalist Nirala has a different opinion about these new songs sung in the name of Ram in the state
 bakaul niraala yah pichley ek-do saal kaa chalan katai nahin he
 He says, 'if such songs are being composed and sung, then our society is fully responsible for this
 duusari baat, yah chalan pichley ek do saal main katai shuru nahin hua he
 If the society opted out of 'jai Siya Ram', some organizations took advantage of it and gave a frenzied slogan of 'jai Shri Ram' and this is not the case today
 aaj se 20-22 saal pehle yah badlaav hua or tab kisi ne aitraaj nahin jataayaa
 No one rejected it and today such songs are present in the society which are intent on changing the entire definition of song and music
 ’ Politics is never silent
 ladaai kii taiyaari tab bhi chalati rahati he jab saamne koi yuddh nahin hota
 On May 16, the results of the Lok Sabha elections blew up almost all the parties of North India in the storm of Namo
 uske baad se desh kii sabase puraani party congress ek ke baad ek haar ke liye khud ko maansik rup se taiyaar kiye baithi he
 But the birth of the movements, the parties of the Janata Parivar have begun to create a shelter by adding a straw and a straw

 That is, presenting the third option by uniting the regional parties of the country
 sharad ujagar, lekin khamosh muhim par nikle hai
 He was the first to succeed in putting Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar, the arch rivals of politics, without losing time after the defeat of the Lok Sabha
 iske baad is tarah kaa maahaul banaaya ki samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ko yahaan tak kahana pad gaya, ‘‘agar nitish haath pakadakar le aaen to ham mayawati ke saath chalane ko taiyaar hai
 "mulayam was making this statement in the circumstances when his party's seats in the Lok Sabha had come down from 21 to five and the bsp's account which won 20 seats in the last Lok Sabha was not even opened
" haalanki mayawati ne taka-sa jawaab dekar maamle ko khatm kar diya
 After all, she does not belong to any public family
 bihar or upi ke baad sharad ne haryana ke jind kaa rukh kiya, purv pradhanmantri taaoo devilal kii sauveen jayanti ke maukey par yojit raily main shaamil hue
 Nitish, Deve Gowda along with nda's Parkash Singh Badal were also present on this platform
 8 aktubar ko sharad sapa ke rashtriya sammelan main lakhanu pahunch gaye
 And finally on October 12, a Rashtriya Lok Dal rally was held in Meerut where Shivpal Singh Yadav, himself as Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav, former Prime Minister and JD (S) leader H
M
 di
 Devgowda, Ajit Singh and his brother Jayant joined
 nitish ne manch se hi shivpal ko salaah di, ‘‘ham to saath hai, ab sochna aap ko he
 In the current era, the time has come for all socialists to come together
 jab bihar main ham or lalu ji ek saath ho sakate hai to yahaan kyon nahin
 Two days after this rally, India Today asked Sharad Yadav at the bungalow at 7 Tughlaq Road in Delhi, what is your intention? So he said, "nothing special like that
" badale halaat main badalane kii koshish bhar he
 "are there preparations for a third front?" He says, "we have old relationships with all these leaders
 abhi koi badi baat bolne kaa samay nahin aayaa he
 "but if Sharad's trustees are to be believed, this time they are dreaming bigger and almost impossible than the Third Front
 ve chaahate hai ki janata parivaar ke puraane log ek saath milakar teesri rashtriya party banaaen
 At present, he has spoken to North India and far-off Kerala
 lekin asli pariksha tab hogi jab ve orissa main biju janata dal ke naveen patnayak or tamilnadu main jayalalita ko manaa saken
 The biggest thing in favor of this dream is that most parties of Janata Parivar are scattered in different states, so there is no fight between them
 lekin ise asambhav banane vaala tathy yah he ki lanka main sab 52 gaj ke hai
 Who will accept the leadership of the satrap here? Will either Mulayam or Nitish or Lalu work under anyone else? Even if such a front is formed, the JD (U), JD (S), RJD, SP, RLD and INLD will have the last Lok Sabha
 There were 55 seats in the Lok Sabha, whereas in the current Lok Sabha, they had 7 in total
 1 fisadi vot or 15 siten milin
 That is, their strength has reduced by one third
 aise main jab tak 34 loksabhaa seat vaali mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress or orissa main 20 seat jeetne vaale biju janata dal se sampark nahin kiya jaataa tab tak tisare morche kii khaas shakl samaj nahin aegi
 After that the CPI and CPM, which hold 10 seats in the Lok Sabha, will also have to stand next to them
 dagar bahut lambii he
 On the other hand, Ajit Singh, who never considered BJP untouchable, is sitting vacant this time
 pehle to bijepi ne pashchimi upi main unka jat voter tod liya or uske baad choudhary charan singh ke jamaane se mili 12, tughlaq road ke bangale ko khaali karaane main pradhanmantri karyaalay ne khaasi dilchaspee dikhaai
 Ajit shifted to a rented house in South Delhi, says on the third front, "only silent about this
" baaki to aap sab dekh hi rahe hai
 "yes, they definitely say that people associated with Chaudhary Sahib came to a stage through the Meerut rally
 uttar pradesh main sapa ke sahyog se bete jayant choudhary ke rajyasabha main jane kii sugabugahat ke sawaal par bhi yah jat netaa puri tarah khamosh he
 If it is made, what will it do? If it becomes a front then what will it do? Because its first test will be in the assembly elections in Bihar next year or in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2017
 haryana main to chunaav ho hi chukaa he
 On these questions, JD (U) Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar Ansari says, "if consensus is reached, the government will face a tough challenge in the Rajya Sabha
" agar ensipi or mamata banerjee saath den to sarkaar ke liye halaat or kathin ho jaaenge
 In fact, despite the overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha, the condition of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha is slim
 sansad ke ucch sadan main bijepi ke paas 43 saansad hai, jabaki akele congress ke paas 68 saansad hai
 Apart from this, these six parties of Janata Parivar have 29 mps
 agar chah saansadon vaala sharad pavaar kii ensipi or 11 saansadon vaale vam morcha or 12 saansadon vaali trinmul congress (tiemasi) inkaa saath detii rahi to sarkaar ke liye ek bhi bill paas karana mushkil ho saktaa he
 Will the SP chief Mulayam give full support to Sharad Yadav's campaign? The sp's national general secretary Naresh Agarwal has a nappy-bent answer to this question, "netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav) can tell it himself
 ’’ haalanki sansad main sarkaar ko gherne ke sawaal par unka tark he, ‘‘sapa to purajor dhang se sarkaar ko gherti hi rahi he
 If other forces also come forward in this work, it is good
 ’’ darasal sapa hameshaa se vah party rahi he jisane aksar banane se pehle hi tisare morche kii itishree kar di
 But in time his move has changed
 usne uttar pradesh main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhale hi acha pradarshan kiya ho, lekin sabko pataa he ki us chunaav main bispi mukaable main utari hi nahin
 Only Behenji (mayawati) knows what the BSP will do in Parliament? If the third front in association with Congress continues to haunt the Modi government, there may be some change in the situation in the coming years
 tisare morche ke chunavi asar par ansaari kehete hai, ‘‘yah sahi he ki tisare morche kii takatein har rajya main apni prabhaav rakhti hai
 Just like the JD (U) strength is not so much in UP, but our candidates cut ten to twenty thousand votes
 yahi sthiti baaki rajyon main he
 The biggest impact will be on the emotional level
 ’’ ve saaf taur par kehete hai ki agar kisi morche main nitish kumaar, sharad yadav, lalu prasad, mulaayam singh, ajit singh, omprakash chautaala yaa naveen patnayak ek saath dikhen to iskaa rashtriya asar hoga
 Front sources have also kept an eye on when Mamata Banerjee approaches her, as she now faces a tough challenge from BJP in West Bengal
 mana ja rahaa he ki nitish lagaataar mamata ko samajhane kii koshish main jute hai
 If all goes well, this combined force can leave a mark in the Bihar assembly elections
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav abhi dur he or teen saal baad siyaasi hawa nishchit taur par hu-ba-hu aaj ke jaisi to nahin hogi
 In such a situation, the alliance of Mulayam and Ajit may loosen the new hold of BJP in Western UP
 mulaayam ke saath agar musalmaan aa sakate hai to ajit ruthe jat bhaaiyon ko manaa sakate hai
 The RLD has also started the Sadbhavana Yatra under the leadership of party general secretary Trilok Tyagi from 2 October

 Vikram Rao says, "the differences between Ajit and Mulayam are old
 or is najuk ghadi main mulaayam singh koi faisla lene main jaldbaaji nahin karenge
 "actually, nobody is hurrying
 sabakaa milanaa-julna jari he
 In practical terms, these meetings and the news arising out of them will work to fill the void that has arisen due to the absence of strong opposition
 ek taraf congress or duusari taraf janata parivaar ke bikhare hue ghatak phir se sampradayikta ke khilaaf golbandi or apane puraane jaateey aadhaar ko majboot karne ke liye tatpar hai
 This new initiative will only do so much that the challenge of the government in the Rajya Sabha will increase and the faces of Lohia, JP and Chaudhary Charan Singh will add some new color in the politics becoming completely Modi-centric
 yah jamaana kuch vaisaa hi hoga jab in logon ne indira gandhi kendrit raajnneeti ko ukhaadie kii hunkaar bhari thi
 However, despite this, Indira Gandhi ruled the country for 17 years
 lekin isse virodh kaa majaa kam nahin hota or loktantr kii tasviir zyada aakarshak ho jaati he

 aam aadmi party ne punjab main congress or akali dal par friendli match khilne or ek-duusare ke bhrashtachar ko chupaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Arvind Kejriwal tweeted a media report on Saturday and accused the Akali Dal and Congress of complicity in Punjab

 Captain Amarendra Singh, in the punjab-haryana High Court against this case, demanded that the case be canceled due to the politically motivated case
 2014 main hycourt ne is maamle kii dobaaraa jaanch ke aadesh punjab sarkaar ko die the

 Action is going on in the court in this case and Captain Amarendra Singh has to appear before the court in this case
 punjab sarkaar bhi kanoon ke tahat is maamle main kaarywai karegi
 At the same time, the Congress said that after the akali-bjp government of Punjab came to power in 2008, this case was registered against Captain Amarendra Singh in political malice
 isi vajah se ab punjab sarkaar ko is maamle main captain amrendra singh ko clin chit deni pad rahi he
 At the same time, Captain Amarendra Singh said that he has lived in the Army, he knows very well what safety standards to take care of

 (input bhashaa se) Bihar, famous for its litchi, will not only increase fruit production this year, but this time litchi will be more juicy than ever before
 is saal lichi kii fasal main pichley saal kii tulana main paanch se saat pratishat ijapha hone kii sambhaavna he
 However, there is also a possibility of some damage to the crop these days due to the scorching heat and sunlight
 desh main lichi kaa utpaadan mukhya taur par bihar, uttarakhand, pashchim bengal or himachal pradesh main lagbhag 76,000 hectare bhoomi par hota he
 Apart from this, it is also produced in Punjab, Tripura, Assam, Odisha and Jharkhand
 lekin desh kii kul lichi utpaadan main bihar kii hissedari 65 pratishat se zyada he
 That is, Bihar is at the forefront of litchi production
 bihar main kul 30,600 hectare bhoomi main lichi kii kheti kii jaati he
 According to the data, a total of 2 in the state in 2009-10
 15 lakh ton lichi kaa utpaadan hua tha, jabaki 2010-11 main rajya main do lakh ton or pichley varsh kareeb teen lakh ton lichi kaa utpaadan hua tha
 Considering the productivity of litchi in the state, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) established a National Research Institute (NRC) for litchi in Muzaffarpur in 2001
 rajya main aise to kai jilon main lichi kii kheti kii jaati he, lekin mujffarpur lichi kii kheti kaa mukhya centre he
 Vishal Nath, director of the National Research Institute from Shahi Lychee to China Lychee, said that there is a possibility of increasing the production of litchi in the state this year
 aise to rajya main shahi, china, laungiya, bekhnaa sahit kai prakaar kii lichi kaa utpaadan kiya jaataa he, lekin yahaan shahi or china lichi kaa utpaadan sarvaadhik hota he
 He says that both these types of litchi are considered as the best
 shahi or china lichi main jitna ras hota he vah anya lichi main nahin hota
 Vishal Nath says that at this time last year, light rain proved very beneficial for lychee
 is kaaran naa keval lichi ke rang or aakar main vruddhi hui, balki lichi ke rason main bhi vruddhi hui thi
 It has not rained yet this year
 vishalnath kehete hai ki is saal abhi tak barish nahin hone ke kaaran lichi ke falon kaa vikaas thik dhang se nahin hua he
 At present the temperature is above 40 ° C, while the maximum temperature for lychee should be 35-37 ° and humidity should be 60 percent
 vaise vah ye bhi maanate hai ki bade pedo main or jahaan pani kii suvidha he vahaan is mausam kaa prabhaav nahin pad rahaa he
 The growth of the fruit of litchi has been corrected there
 garmi ke kaaran fasal ko ho rahaa nuksayanumaan ke mutabik pichley varsh kii tulana main is varsh lichi ke utpaadan main 5-7 pratishat kii vruddhi tay maani ja rahi he
 Now lychee is ready in most areas and the work of plowing is about to begin
 lichi kii tudai kaa kaam june ke madhya tak chalegaa
 Apart from the suitability of the weather, one of the major reasons for increase in production of litchi in the state is that NRC scientists consider farmers to be better farming methods
 lichi ke utpaadan main vruddhi ke kaaran kisaan bhi isse jud rahe hai
 Whip and lychee growers of the Bihari Thakur Farmers Club say that due to the weather, the fruits have not been fully prepared for the farmers
 kai aise kisaan hai jo tudai shuru nahin kar paae hai
 Fruits in the tree have also burst due to heat

 At the same time, the civil aviation ministry has not commented on whether the Modi government will stick to the development plan of 200 airports
 gauratlab he ki 2009 se ab tak bharat ne aath airport par 326 karod rupye kharch kiye hai jinamein se kahin bhi nirdhaarit flites nahin aati hai
 These white elephants are like a warning to Prime Minister Modi who has been continuously emphasizing on the development of infrastructure
 spicejet limited ke siio sanjeev kapur ke mutabik sarkaar ko samajhnaa chahie ki bas airport bana dene bhar se hamaara vahaan janaa sunishchit nahin ho jaataa

 According to Sanjeev Kapoor, CEO, spicejet Limited, the government should understand that just by making the airport, it does not ensure that we go there
 bataa den ki is airline ne dakshin bharat kii mysore city main sirf isliye janaa band kar diya kyonki vahaan paryaapt maang nahin ban paa rahi thi
 These deserted terminals in India were mostly built under the rule of the Congress government, which had planned to build 200 'no frills' (no tam jham) airports so that more people could travel by air and even remote areas could be connected

 Otherwise what is the reason that a government in its decision in its tenure should allow the CBI to file a case and later come to the rescue of the minister concerned

 The raid on the Department of Telecommunications and search operations in 19 institutions across the country is likely based on facts and legal arguments

 lekin pradhanmantri kaa, jinke prati sibiai javabdeh he, kahana he ki koi ghotaalaa hi nahin he
 Meanwhile, the DMK is surprised that it is a Congress scam

 Baalu also satirized the Prime Minister and senior Congress leaders after the meeting on the issue of Sri Lankan refugees and said, "are we allies?" Will it still be called the alliance? According to it, the spectrum was sold at a cheaper price and was not auctioned, and some companies were preferred on a first-come, first-served basis
 farji yueyes licenson ke aavanton par andeh 2 november, 2007 se kiya ja rahaa he
 The allocation of spectrum was being done under the supervision of a group of ministers and the Communications Minister claims that "the process of licensing issue was reported to the Prime Minister"
 '' chunki maamla tab adaalat main tha isliye raja ne tatkaaleen solicytor general (mahadhivaktaa) gulam vaahnavati se salaah maangi thi, jo ab mahanyaywaadee hai
 Obviously, it could not be of any use
 ghotaale kii kahani is andeh se upajati he ki companiyon ko saste license die gaye or unhone apni equity ko bhunaaya
 For instance, companies named Swan and Unitech received Rs 1,658 crore
 kii rakam kaa bhugtan karne ke baad license mili
 It was only after this that Swain took a 45 per cent stake in uae's Etisalat for Rs 4,500 crore

 But according to the rules, promoters are prohibited from selling their shares
 iske alaava paisa nae ishu jari karke jutaya gaya
 Incidentally, these two companies were not the only ones to bring in foreign collaborators
 tata teleservices ne japan kii pramukh doorsanchaar company do ko mo ko 2
 Agreed to a 26 percent stake with an investment of $ 7 billion
 is tarah license kaa mulya badhkar 10 arab dollar ho gaya
 Foreign Disinvestment Case In fact, almost every operator disinvested its stake in favor of foreign companies and foreign institutional investors
 raja sawaal uthaate hai, ''desh ko yah jaanane kaa haq he ki apane share videshi niveshkon ko saunpkar in companiyon ke pramotaron ne kitna paisa kamaaya he
 The issue of allotments was raised by the Prime Minister in letters to the king and it has also been a matter of discussion within the government and Parliament
 maujuuda operataron kaa kahana he ki spectrum kii nilaamee kii jaani chahie thi, lekin rashtriya doorsanchaar niti (antipi) 1999 ke jariye apane batch nikalne ke maamle main ve chuppi saadh jate hai, jab sarkaar ne license fees main 15 varshon se dey lagbhag 50,000 karod ru
 Had forgiven the dues and replaced it with a profit sharing arrangement
 license ke tahat ek company (khilaadi) ko mahaj 4
 4 mhz was the right but between 2001 and 2003 the operators got an additional 2 without any kind of approval
 2 megahertz pradaan kar die gaye
 Rajavidambha, buoyed by the charge of selling spectrum cheaply, is that Raja had raised the issue of price of additional spectrum and TRAI is working on his request to prepare a proper price formula for additional spectrum
 spectrum saste bechney ke aarope se baukhalaaye raja ne pradhanmantri or sibiai ko patr likhakar 1999 se atirikt spectrum ke aavanton ko jaanch ke daayre main shaamil karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 The opposition did not delay in calling it a scam, while in reality, two major changes in the telecom policy - NTP 99 and UAS license system - were due to the NDA rule in 1999 and 2003 respectively, forging friendships with the capitalists
 There were allegations of isamen koi shaq nahin ki khanij, jameen or spectrum jaisi rashtriya sampada kaa acha mulya nirdhaarit hona chahie
 But it should be suited to the interests of consumers, it should not be convenient to vested interests
 sara dhyaan niamakon par he, jinhone apane akalan main jan sansadhano ko nijee companiyon ke laabh main badal diya he
 Interestingly, on October 19, two days before the raids, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) investigated Unitech Wireless's application and to the extent of seeking approval to increase the foreign shareholding of "telner Asia, Singapore" Permitted that its direct and indirect share be increased to 74 per cent

 Importantly, the CCEA did not find a reason to question the investment by Telenor
 sahyogiyon ko aukaat dikhaane kaa khel'kyon' or 'abhi hi kyon' aise sawaal hai jo dramuk apni sahyogi congress se puch rahi he
 She is surprised to think that she has joined the category of angry Nationalist Congress Party and Trinamool Congress
 raja or dramuk tamilnadu main congress kii mahatvakankshaon kii atakalon or is kadam ke samay ko lekar hi bhaybheet hai
 By the way, from the other point of view, this mistake can also be done by the Congress, at least this is what the big leaders of Congress are saying to the DMK supremo
 haalanki dilli main joardaar atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai or kaha ja rahaa he ki yah congress ke apane sahyogiyon ko aukaat dikhaane kii mahatvakanksha kaa hissaa he
 And every passing incident is finding a place in the conspiracy theory
 vah chaahe noida main mayawati dwaara banaae ja rahe smarakon ko paryaaraneey manjuuri dene kii baat ho yaa trinmul congress kii sarvesarva mamata banerjee kaa silligudi prakaran or mumbai main rakanpa kii yantranaadayak pariksha ho
 a new front has also opened in Uttar Pradesh where the Samajwadi Party is being harassed due to the challenge of Yadav dynasty with Congress dynasty
 congress ko kerani chahie nishpaksh jaanch kii vakalatwajah chaahe jo bhi ho, vipaksh (vam or dakshinpanthi donon) kii gaiyr maujuudagi se phuli congress khud ko manamaujee sthiti main paa rahi he
 If there is any other plan, it is put on hold
 yadi uskaa maananaa he ki koi ghotaalaa hua bhi he to congress ko ek nishpaksh jaanch kii vakaalat kerani chahie
 But if that is not the case and there is truth in the Congress's convictions then it can be said that a party camp has taken over the agenda
 yah yaad rakhana party ke hit main hi hoga ki 1980 ke dashak main jab use 400 se adhik siten mili thim, korporavt mahayuddh main kud kar usne khud vipaksh taiyaar kar liya tha
 Otherwise, what can be explained about this scam? After all, why the government, which has successfully dealt with issues like Bofors, will give life to the BJP by exposing a scam just few weeks before the Parliament session

 'jignesh not behind the incident' Athawale defended Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani
 unhone kaha ki is ghatana ke peeche jignesh nahin hai
 In his argument, Athawale said, 'jignesh speaks against Modi ji, but he has no hand in this incident

 The Shiv Sena has said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana', "the incidents that took place on the release of this film" were frightening, ruthless and these developments have done the job of rubbing salt on the wounds of the martyred jawans
 ’’ is film ke nirmaataaon or manase ke bich sandhi karaane ke liye fadanvis ko vipakshi congress or rakanpa kii ore se aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 It is alleged that by doing this, Fadnavis has abdicated his main responsibility to maintain law and order
 ‘saamana’ ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘‘parde ke peeche kaaphi kuch hua or is film ko lekar sabhi virodh ‘varsha’ (mukhyamantri ke aadhikarik awaas) main chaay-naashte ke saath khatm ho gaya
 We do not want to go into who wins and who loses, but the whole incident has insulted our martyred soldiers
 ’’ isamen kaha gaya he, ‘‘kendriya netaa pakistan ko dhamka rahe hai or lakshith hamalon par vaahvahee lut rahe hai
 But none of these leaders have the courage to say that films with Pakistani actors will not be allowed to be released
 lakshith hamalon ke baad pakistan kareeb 25 baar sangharsh viraam kaa ulanghan kar chukaa he or kisi ko isaki parvaah nahin he
 The Shiv Sena said that Fadnavis had a chance to show that there is a "56-inch chest" and its backbone is stronger than the previous Congress-led government
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘‘varsha main chaay satr ke baad kaiyon ke chehre se nakaab hat gaye
 Karan Johar was asked to infuse Rs five crore into the army welfare fund in exchange for the release of his film
