 Now all the 1500 electrified villages will be investigated for the first time in UP

 How can a katiya connection be considered stolen? maine tivi par dekha ki upi siem tak ek gaanv ke bare main kah rahe hai ki vah 1985 main vidyutikrut ho gaya
 Is the Chief Minister recognizing power theft? All was going well, then Modiji did not say that with the cooperation of the states, the darkness is being removed

 Input from IANS beete do maheenon main duusari baar mumbai main ek pati ne jaan dene se pehle khudakushi kaa video banaaya he
 The special thing is that both of them have described their wife's infidelity as a reason for suicide in the video
 mumbai ke seoul ilaake main 18 november ko bijnesaman jyesh raut ne faansee lagaakar aatmahatya kar lee
 In a 44-minute video of his suicide, Jayesh left a suicide note in which he described 23-year-old wife Trupti and her lover 38-year-old Rajesh Verma as the cause of death
 yahi nahin faansee lagane se pehle jyesh ne tripti ko text massej kiya ki vah uski maut kaa video dekhe or aspataal main uske sharir ko dekhne aa jaae
 Police arrested both the accused on 23 November
 donon buudhvaar tak police remand par hai
 'can't quit, she got me a job' Police officials say that Jayesh and Trupti were married in February after a nine-year affair
 jyesh siddhivinayak mandir ke paas phool kii dukaan chalaata tha
 Few days after marriage, the two started fighting
 tripti ne jyesh ko bataaya ki vah rajesh se pyaar karti he or use nahin chhod sakati, kyonki rajesh ne hi use car showrooms main naukari dilaai he
 Jayesh tries to convince her, but Tripti leaves home and stays with Rajesh
 
 
 
 Then Tripti said, According to the information, i am going to be a mother
 On November 16, Tripti returned home

 If the Shiv Sena has an opinion about the Maharashtra government, then the new government is like a new daughter-in-law, if the mother-in-law neglects the public, then the public will catch ear
 kuch log isamen gharelu hinsa ko badhaava dene ke sanket dhund sakate hai par hamen to shivasena ke paariwarik sanskaron kii jhalak najar ai
 The Shiv Sena has always been a party to think about family and within the family
 vaise bhi swa
 After Bal Thackeray, Uddhav Thackeray and Abaditya Thackeray have already shown Shiv Sena how much they have faith in family values
 udhar, congress memrahul gandhi ko party kii kamansaunpane kii sugabugahat machi he, ye koi choti baat nahin he
 Today, when relations are losing their real meaning, then these small efforts of Congress and Shiv Sena are showing importance of family
 paariwarik filmein kam ban rahi hai to aisi‘family partiyaan’hi samaaj ko sahi disha dikhaa sakati hai
 Even after all this, the government in Maharashtra became that of the BJP
 rajya main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kaa shapath grahan samaaroh bhi kai myanon main anoothaa rahaa kyonki narendra modi ne ek tir se kai nishane jo kar daale
 First of all, Narendra Modi called Advani in swearing-in here after Haryana and took a snake on his heart
 duusare ‘vankhede stadium’ main kaarykram kara shahrukh khan kii bhi taang khinchaai kar lee, bechaare ja nahin sakate vahaan bain laga he naa
 At the Wankhede Stadium, he spent a lot of time on the face of all those people who were calling Arvind Kejriwal's decision to take oath at Ramlila Maidan instead of the assembly, a waste of money for the public's hard-earned money
 antim samay tak lag rahaa tha ki shivasena kaarykram main na bulaae jane par apana itihaas doharaate hue vankhede stadium kii pich to khod hi aegi par aisa hua nahin, uddhav thakare pahunch gaye bhale bijepi ‘na uddhav se lenaa na maadho’ ko dena vaale mood main rahi ho
 Whether the government should call the Shiv Sena daughter-in-law or the mother-in-law itself, the fact is that the Shiv Sena was like a sleepy girl who had gone out of her mouth when she was getting low, and now she was sitting waiting for someone to hold the urn if i wanted to sleep Demand for a ring and Kanjeevaram saree
 apane tareeke se shivasena ne up-mukhyamantri kaa pad maang bhi liya, up-mukhyamantri kaa pad or das mantriyon ko shapath grahan karaane kii maang ke badale 63 vidhayak dene kaa ofer pehle bhi aayaa tha
 i swear such an offer would not have been offered to anyone who sold a pen drive for one rupee on the Big Billion Day Sale
 shivasena ko apane vidhayak sambhaal kar rakhane chahie
 The BJP had shown in Delhi that it did not believe in manipulation to form a government, but if it did not collect or 'account' with the Shiv Sena on tomorrow

 se gathbandhan ho gaya, to shivasena ke kaam oelex or quikar aa sakati hai

 But the whole trance resonated with this song and the soldiers became fresh again, as if they had been sleeping and having fun for four days
 dopaher, raat gai he
 It is dark
 sannata chaaya hua he
 Bodhasingh is sleeping by laying both his blankets on three tins of empty pots and wearing two blankets of Lahnasingh and a Barankot

 One eye is at the mouth of the trench and one at the lean body of the Bodh Singh

 "why, Bodha Bhai, what is that?" "drink water" Lahnasingh asked the bowl with its mouth, "say, how are you?" Drinking water, Bodha said, "the company is missing out

 The teeth are ringing "
 "acha, meri jersi pahan lo!""or tum?""mere paas sigdi he or mujhe garmi lagati he

 Bodha also started taking off the blankets

 When Lahnasingh came forward, Bodha's father Subedar pointed to Bodha with a finger
 lahanasingh samaj kar chup ho gaya
 Who are the ten men behind? is par badi huzzat hui
 Nobody wanted to live

 Lapatan Sahib turned away from Lahna's cigar and started smuggling it out of his pocket

 He saw that Lapton Saheb took out three shells equal to a bell from his pocket

 Next to the wire was a string of yarn, which was placed near the cigar

 Like lightning, Lahnasingh lifted the vomit gun with both hands and pointed at Sahab's elbow

 Lahnasingh hit the neck of a kunda sahib and sahib 'eye! i got worried saying 'meen Gott'
 lahanasingh ne teenon gole been kar khandak ke baahar phenke or sahab ko ghaseet kar sigdi ke paas litayaa
 Pockets searched
 teen-chaar lifaafe or ek diary nikaal kar unhen apni jeb ke hawaale kiya
 The officer regained consciousness
 lahanasingh hans kar bolaa, "kyon lapton sahab? mizaaj kaisaa he? aaj maine bahut baaten sikhin
 It was learned that Sikhs smoke cigarettes

 It was learned that Muslims offer water to the butler idols

 But say this, where did you learn such clean Urdu? Our Lapton Sahab did not even say the five words of bin 'dame "
 Lahna did not search the trouser pockets

 Three months later a Turki Maulvi came to my village
 auraton ko bachche hone ke taabeej baantta tha or bacchon ko dawaai detaa tha

 Everyone got ready with guns

 The bullet passed through the Subedar's right shoulder

 For Bhajji, Sachin is not only a friend but also a guru
 ji haa, in donon ke bich he guru chele kaa rishta
 When Sachin Tendulkar was in practice before Mohali's third Test at PCA Cricket Stadium, Harbhajan Singh went to him and said something
 to sachin ne bhajji ko nets par hi rahane ko kaha
 Shortly after, Sachin was seen telling Bhajji his bowling flaws
 zyada nahin, bas paanch minute tak sachin bole or is dauraan bhajji keval sunate rahe
 What was the point of this thing was understood only after some time when Bhajji was seen bowling on a stump
 sachin ke kehane par bhajji ek stump par gendbaaji karte rahe, jald hi wo lay main aa gayi or takreeban har gend par stump bikherne lage
 During this, Sachin kept watching them and was happy
 bhajji jab ek stump ke saath bilkul sahaj ho gayi tab sachin ne alag alag greep ke saath gend karne kaa tarika bataaya
 Also how much of the loop and how should it be
 bhajji ne jald hi isapar bhi niyantran paa liya
 The two left after practicing for about half an hour
 form main aane or wicket chatakaane ke liye hi wo sachin kii sharan main gayi
 But this practice alone did not have much effect with Sachin and Dhoni did not give him a place in the last eleven
 yani chele ke kaam nahin ai guru kii sikh
 By the way, why does Bhajji not find a place in the playing XI? bhajji form main nahin hai or australia ke khilaaf do test main bhajji ko keval paanch wicket hi mili hai
 Although he bowled but he did not have the edge in his balls that led to the wicket

 Just like a mother has a heart
 vaise baba logon kaa bhi dil hota he
 Why is it always expected from a Baba that Baba ji will come, ring the bell, shake his hair and go on chanting Jai Jai
 baba kaa man bhi tamanchey par disco karne kaa ho saktaa he
 So, with some such intentions of stuck-down jerk-off, Ram Rahim Gurmeet Singh ji has emerged on the chest of Bollywood with his hairy Sina Lieutenant of God (MSG)
 'koi hamen sant kahata he to koi kahata he farista
 Some say Guru, others say God
 par ham to sirf hai ek insaan'
 Hey Baba, how can you be a human being? aapkaa yah dialog jamaa nahin
 On the one hand, you are standing alone in the style of Sunny Deol
 duusari taraf insaan hone kaa dialog bhi munh se gira rahe ho, phulon kii tarah
 What is this baba? dear baba, aapaki film kaa trailor itnaa bhaukali he kasam se
 Rajinikanth's Linga was released earlier, otherwise you would have a direct fight with him
 baba acha kar rahe ho jo field change karne kii taraf soch rahe ho
 Nowadays in Babagiri, he is no longer a charm
 sab aapke asaram and rampal bro kaa kara dharaa he
 Well, congratulations on the new career Baba
 phans to aapke paas pehle se hi hai
 Yes devotees, the music in Baba's film is very good
 ek seen main to akshay kumaar kii khilaadi 786 kaa gaanaa 'o balmaa' yaad aa gaya
 There are some dialogues of Baba whose future is long, for example
 
 1
 hamen maarna apane aapako maarane ke baraabar he
 2
 ham aise baap hai, jo dushmano ke liye akele hi kaaphi hai
 3
 agar desh kii seva karnaa paap he to ye paap ham aakhri saans tak karte rahenge
 4
 hamen maarna apane aap ko maarane ke baraabar he
 Baba, i have a desire for tapori inside me, if i do not mind, i should tell you

 Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav also contested two seats and won the election
 kamishan ne seat chode jane par karaae jane vaale upachunaav ke kharche ko rokane ke liye iskaa suzav diya

 noida or greater noida ke bich safar karne waalon ke liye ek badi khushkhabari he, jaldi vah metro train par safar kar sakenge
 The coaches of the Metro train running on the route of Aqua Line i
e
 Noida and Greater Noida reached Noida on Friday
 noida metro rail corporation ne china ke nanjing shahar kii ek company se 19 metro train kaa order diya he
 About one and a half months ago this train and all coaches were flown from Nanjing city in China
 30 disambar se trial shuru, dilli metro kaa staff hogaam janata ke liye khushkhabari yah he ki isi maheene ke ant tak noida or greater noida ke bich metro kaa trial ran shuru kar diya jayega 3 maheene tak yah trial ran chalegaa or uske baad march yaa phir april se aam janata ke liye metro kii shuruyaat kar di jaaegi
 Initially, Delhi Metro officials and employees have been engaged to run the Noida Metro, while 10 employees from China will also help the Noida Metro Rail Corporation
 bataaya gaya he ki 5 saal baad dilli metro rail corporation ise swatantra kar degaa or phir noida metro ko hi ise sanbhaalanaa hoga
 The 29 km long route, the metro route running on the aqua line between Public Chalignoida and Greater Noida from April, is 29 km long which is equal to all the routes of Delhi Metro
 abhi tak noida city centre kii noida kaa aakhri metro stesan he ab city centre se pari chowk tak metro jaaegi yani ab noida se greater noida or dilli tak kaa safar behad aasaan bharaa hone vaala he
 Metro officials want the route from Greater Noida to Gurgaon to be decided directly

 bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (AIIMS) kii medical board ne 16 saal kii naaballig rape peedita ko aborshan karwaane kii ijaajat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 According to the High Court directive, the board had to decide after the investigation whether the abortion was fatal for the victim
 board ne apni report main kaha he kinaballig kaa garbh7 maheene kaa he
 In such a situation, if abortion occurs on this stage, it can prove to be fatal for the victim
 bataa den ki do saal pehle naaballig ladki kaa skool ke baahar se apharan kar liya gaya tha or rape kii ghatana ko anjaam diya gaya
 The interesting fact in the victim's claim and report is that when the minor petitioned the court for permission for abortion, the pregnancy was 24 weeks, but the AIIMS medical board investigated that 30 weeks had been completed
 Have been gauratlab he ki kanoon desh main 20 hafte se upar ke garbh ko giraane kii ijaajat nahin he
 The reasoning behind this is that it can prove fatal for a woman
 pichley hafte court ke dar par pahunchi peeditanbalig rape peedita ne pichley hafte dilli hai court me apnebhrun ko giraaneki ijaajat maangi thi

 The debate started

 Earlier, the people expected the government to read these files on its behalf
 ab janata se kah diya gaya he ki wo in filon ko pard le

 In the same way, when it comes to Nehru, sometimes Gandhi's

 Meanwhile, so many misconceptions and claims about history are spread that historians start writing articles in newspapers

 magar yah sangharsh nai sarkaar ke aane se kyon charchaa main aata he, nae shodh yaa nai kitaab se kyon charchit nahin hota
 The question is how will you see these injustice

 Has anyone written anything new on Ashok, Bhagat Singh, Sardar Patel or Maharana Pratap, on the basis of which any old political writings are being challenged
 sadak kaa naam badalakar, ek chapter jodakar yaa chapter se ek para hataakar ham kisi nayak ko na to jagah de sakate hai, na hi uske saath insaaf kar sakate hai

 Do you viewers also buy books related to these heroes with every controversy or do you accept what is said in TV debates as fact
 kya inase itihaas ko lekar suchintit tareeke se bahes ho rahi he yaa apni daavedaari ko sahi tehraaya ja rahaa he
 Can the reputation of Maharana Pratap be established only by changing the name of Akbar Road? Is Maharana Pratam's name so anonymous that a state chief minister and an MP want to make up for this deficiency by changing the name of Akbar Road? Is this not the political use of Maharana Pratap more than Akbar? Is this such an important issue? We google what is there only in the name of Maharana Pratap in Delhi - Maharana Pratap International Bus Stand, Maharana Pratap Enclave, Maharana Pratap Bhawan, Keshavapuram, Maharana Pratap Industries, Maharana Pratap Road, Balmiki Colony, Karol Bagh, Maharana Pratap Public School , Harsha Vihar, Maharana Pratap Public School, Karaval Nagar

 bengal main chunaav aane the isliye disbanr-janvari ke maheene main netaji kii file ko lekar kaaphi charchaa hone lagi
 Netaji's family was called to Delhi
 ek kism kii pratispardhaa shuru ho gai
 Sometimes Prime Minister Modi started talking about making the files public
 pradhanmantri ne 100 filon ko saarvajanik kar diya to mamata banerjee ne 64 filon ko saarvajanik kar diya
 Long-running programs began to be made on TV channels about the mysteries of Netaji's death
 bahes hone lagi
 Now the election has passed
 netaji ko sab bhul gaye hai
 Thousands of page files have been opened to the public
 pehle janata sarkaar se aashaa karti thi ki uski taraf se in filon ko padhakar bataaya jayega
 Now the public has been told to read these files
 12 hazaar se adhik pannon ko kya janata pard sakati he
 After these files are made public do we know anything about Netaji's death last or authoritatively
 isi tarah se kabhi nehru kii baat aa jaati he to kabhi gandhi kii
 Sometimes the words of Savarkar begin to arise and sometimes Patel
 sab apane apane hisaab se vyaktiyon nayakon ko chunate hai or itihaas kii aisi vyakhya karte hai jaise vahi vyakti ekmaatr nirnaayak tha
 Then there is competition between two heroes

 Many pages of history also opened up in this debate
 saraswati nadi se lekar vande maataram tak khub jhagada hua
 From Mahishasura to Gurugram
 myth, itihaas, samskruti
 Don't know how many subjects came and how many went

 a variety of relay races is on
 in bahason se hamaara itihaas bodh kitna samrudh hua, ye aap hi behatar bataa sakate hai
 But it is so important that even though we refrain from reading history, we look at the study of history with hikrat, but the way it has been discussed, it seems that history is our future
 ham jab 90 ke dashak main itihaas padhane aae the to pehali hi kaksha main bataaya gaya tha ki itihaas raja rani or nayakon ke gungan or biography se aage nikal chukaa he
 The Marxist phase of history is also in its final stages
 sabaltern itihaas ke zariye aam logon kaa itihaas or unke bich itihaas kii samaj saamne aane lagi
 Seen so many streams of historiography in which every stream was challenging the interpretation before it
 raajnneeti jis itihaas lekhan ke bare main bataati he class room main vaisaa itihaas nahin he
 At times, it seems that history has started to fall into the stories of the character of King Rani and heroes
 uskaa akaash itnaa failaa hua he, magar koi he jo samet rahaa he
 It is also true that there has been a strong struggle between right-wing historiography and left-wing historiography
 magar yah sangharsh nai sarkaar ke aane se kyon charchaa main aata he, nae shodh yaa nai kitaab se kyon charchit nahin hota
 The question is how will you see these injustice
 apni sarkaar ke hisaab se yaa nae tathyon ke hisaab se
 Has anyone written anything new on Ashok, Bhagat Singh, Sardar Patel or Maharana Pratap, on the basis of which any old political writings are being challenged
 sadak kaa naam badalakar, ek chapter jodakar yaa chapter se ek para hataakar ham kisi nayak ko na to jagah de sakate hai, na hi uske saath insaaf kar sakate hai
 The whole hall is limited to one's birth anniversary
 jayanti kii taarikh guzarate hi duusare nayak kii baat hone lagati he
 Do you viewers also buy books related to these heroes with every controversy or do you accept what is said in TV debates as fact
 kya inase itihaas ko lekar suchintit tareeke se bahes ho rahi he yaa apni daavedaari ko sahi tehraaya ja rahaa he

 This statement was for some individual players
 kuch player ke saath mere rishte jari rahenge
 i know some who play for RCB and that is not going to change
 1 / 2 My answer at the post match conference has been blown way out of proportion
 i did not categorically say the whole Australian team but— Virat Kohli (@imvkohli) March 30, 20172 / 2only a couple of individuals
 i continue to be in good terms with the few guys i know & who I've played with at RCB & that doesn't change

 To please Baba Bholenath, you are also fasting on Monday, so complete this fast by reading or listening to the story of Shiva fasting
 
 
 somvaar vrath kii vidhi:naarad puraana ke anusaar somvaar vrath main vyakti ko praatah snaan karke shiv ji ko jal orbel patr chadhaanachahie tathaa shiv-gauri kii puja kerani chahie
 The story of Monday fast should be heard after Shiva worship
 iske baad keval ek samay hi bhojan karnaa chahie
 Normally, Monday fast is till the third hour of the day
 matlab shaam tak rakhaa jaataa he
 There are three types of Monday fasts, one per Monday fast, the mild Pradosh fast and sixteen Monday fast
 in sabhi vraton ke liye ek hi vidhi hoti he
 Vrat Katha: Once upon a time, a moneylender lived in a city
 uske ghar main dhan kii koi kami nahin thi lekin uski koi santan nahin thi is kaaran vah bahut dukhi tha
 He had a fast every Monday to get a son and worshiped Lord Shiva and Parvati Ji with full devotion
 uski bhakthi dekhakar ek din maa parvati prasann ho gayi or bhagwaan shiv se us sahuukaar kii manokamana purna karne kaa aagrah kiya
 Hearing the wishes of Parvati ji, Lord Shiva said, 'O Parvati, every creature in this world gets the fruits of his deeds and whose fate he has to suffer
 ' lekin parvati ji ne sahuukaar kii bhakthi kaa maan rakhane ke liye uski manokamana purna karne kii ichha jataai
 On the request of Mata Parvati, Shivji gave a boon to the moneylender but he also said that his child will be only twelve years old
 mata parvati or bhagwaan shiv kii baatcheet ko sahuukaar sun rahaa tha
 He was neither happy nor sad about this
 vah pehle kii bhaanti shivaji kii puja karata rahaa
 After some time a son was born to the moneylender
 jab vah balak gyaarah varsh kaa hua to use padhane ke liye kaashi bhej diya gaya
 The moneylender called the maternal uncle of the son and gave him a lot of money and said that you take this child to attain Kashi Vidya and perform Yajna on the way
 jahaan bhi yajna karaao vahaan brahmanon ko bhojan karaate or dakshina dete hue janaa
 Both uncles and nephews would perform yajna in the same way and donate dakshina to Brahmins and went towards Kashi
 raat main ek nagar padaa jahaan nagar ke raja kii kanya kaa vivaah tha
 But the prince he was about to marry was Kana with one eye
 rajkumaar ke pita ne apane putr ke kaana hone kii baat ko chupaane ke liye ek chaal sochi
 Seeing the moneylender's son, a thought came to his mind
 usne sochaa kyon na is ladke ko duulhaa banaakar rajkumaari se vivaah kara duun
 After marriage, i will give it away and will take the princess to her city
 ladke ko duulhe ke vastra pahanaakar rajkumaari se vivaah kar diya gaya
 But the moneylender's son was honest
 use yah baat nyaaysangat nahin lagi
 He took the opportunity and wrote on the foot of the princess's sardine, 'you are married to me, but the prince with whom you will be sent is Kana with one eye
 main to kaashi padhane ja rahaa hum
 'when the princess read the words written on the chunni, she told her parents this
 raja ne apni putree ko vidaa nahin kiya jisase baraat waapas chali gai
 On the other hand, the moneylender's boy and his maternal uncle reached Kashi and went there and performed a yagna
 jis din ladke kii aayu 12 saal kii hui usee din yajna rakhaa gaya
 The boy told his maternal uncle that my health is not right
 mamaa ne kaha ki tum andar jaakar so jaao
 According to Shiva's boon, the child's life came out in a while
 mrit bhaanje ko dekh uske mamaa ne vilaap shuru kiya
 Incidentally at the same time, Shiva and Mata Parvati were going from there
 parvati ne bhagwaan se kaha- swami, mujhe iske rone ke swar sahan nahin ho rahaa
 You must remove this person's suffering
 jab shivaji mrit balak ke sameep gaye to vah bole ki yah usee sahuukaar kaa putr he, jise maine 12 varsh kii aayu kaa vardaan diya
 Now its age is over
 lekin matra bhav se vibhor mata parvati ne kaha ki he mahadev, aap is balak ko or aayu dene kii krupa karen anyathaa iske viyog main iske mata-pita bhi tadap-tadap kar mar jaaenge
 At the insistence of Mata Parvati, Lord Shiva granted the boy the boon of being alive
 shivaji kii krupa se vah ladkaa jivit ho gaya
 After finishing education, the boy went to his city with maternal uncle
 donon chalate hue usee nagar main pahunche, jahaan uskaa vivaah hua tha
 He also performed a yajna in that city
 us ladke ke sasur ne use pahchaan liya or mahal main le jaakar uski khatirdaari kii or apni putree ko vidaa kiya
 Here the moneylender and his wife were hungry and thirsty waiting for their son
 unhone pran kar rakhaa tha ki yadi unhen apane bete kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to vah bhi praan tyaag denge parantu apane bete ke jivit hone kaa samachar paakar vah behad prasann hue
 The same night Lord Shiva came in the dream of the merchant and said - o superior, i have given a long life to your son, happy with your Monday fast and listening to the fast
 isi prakaar jo koi somvaar vrath karata he yaa katha sunata or padhata he uske sabhi dukh dur hote hai or samast manokamanaayen purna hoti hai

 About 500 children trapped in Jaipur under the Prime Minister's Special Scholarship Scheme were not happy when after watching the news on 'aaj Tak', Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Rajasthan government ministers called their children and pained them
 Two days later Delhi is heard and heard
 isse pehle rajasthan ke shiksha mantri or rajnath singh ne 'aaj tak' ko phonkar in bacchon ke phone number liye
 The Prime Minister's Special Scholarship Jammu & Kashmir scheme was launched by the Ministry of Human Resources, Government of India with this expectation in 2010
 lekin 2015 main is skim main scolership ke niyamon main itane badlaav kar die gaye ki jammu-kashmir ke bachche scolership nahin milane se padhai chhodkar waapas laut rahe hai
 At present, scholarship of 12 thousand and a half thousand students of Jammu and Kashmir who have enrolled in universities across the country has been stopped
 'aaj tak' ne jaipur ke gyaan vihaar uniwarsity menjammu-kashmirake chaatro kaa dard sunaaya tha ki kis tarah se ye rajya ke baahar pradhanmantri special scolership jammu and kashmir yojana ke tahat yahaan daakhila liya tha
 But suddenly studentship has been discontinued
 2010 main jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko desh kii mukhyadhara se jodne ke liye har saal paanch hajaar chaatro ko rajya ke baahar ke collejon-vishvavidhyalayon main padhane ke liye scolership dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 This scheme was started by the Ministry of Human Resources, Government of India
 lekin 2014-15 main desh main ai nai sarkaar ne ise maanav sansaadhan mantralay se hataakar eisitisi ko de di
 Now the scholarships of the students who came to study here in 2013 were discontinued in 2015 saying that your university does not have 12B certificate i
e
 government or government funded university
 ye nayaa niyam 2015 main joda gaya he
 Students angry at not giving money citing this rule are saying that many students have returned who are forced to run stones
 lekin jaise hi ye khabar 'aaj tak' par chali rajasthan ke shiksha mantri kaalicharan sharraf ne baat kii or phir grahamantri rajnath singh ne
 Mohammed Takine, a student who came to Gyan Vihar University to study forma from Kargil's Dasna, said that before ten minutes of the news on 'aaj Tak', we got a call from the minister of Rajasthan government, he listened to us and then himself The Home Minister of Rajnath Singh spoke to us and said that tell the whole thing
 hamane unhen puraa samajhaayaa ki ham yahaan kaise aakar fanse hai or hamaare saath kya hua he
 Then he said that write down your problems completely and then you guys come to Delhi after two days
 isi uniwarsity main padhane vaale hossain kehete hai ki ham to thak kar lautne vaale the lekin 'aaj tak' kii news ke baad jis tarah se sabake phone aae hai hamen lagata he ki hamaara kariyar batch jayega
 Similarly, many universities have been told that AICTC is not approved, whereas AICTC does not have the authority to certify university courses
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke bartaav se jammu-kashmir main afvaah fail rahi he ki ye sena kii skim he or army bacchon ko fansaa rahi he
 This time in counseling, the students allege that AICTC has rigged it
 ek chaatr ko pehle madhya pradesh ke ek gaanv main bisie karne bhej diya jahaan pricipal ne kaha ki ye koun si skim he hamen pataa nahin he tum to puure paise lao
 It is worth mentioning that this scheme was started for the children of villages and poor in Jammu and Kashmir, but till then no one is able to reach the children with this scheme
 udhar isi tarah kii pradhanmantri special scolership jammu and kashmir pakistan sarkaar ne shuru kii he jiskaa jammu-kashmir main khub prachaar prasar kiya ja rahaa he
 These children are sad that the Government of India is giving scholarships under the Nepa scheme to Nepalese students studying with them in this university, but they are not giving them
 yahaan tak ki bihar or madhya pradesh sarkaar bhi inke saath padhane vaale chaatro ko scolership de rahi he
 At present, in Rajasthan alone, about 10,000 students of Jammu and Kashmir are studying

 On one hand in Delhi it is getting cold, on the other hand the politics here is constantly boiling
 dilli main sarkaar banane ke liye aam aadmi party ko samarthan dene ke mudde par congress ke bheetar alag-alag raay he
 Of the 8 Congress mlas, 3 are not in favor of supporting the AAP
 congress ke baaki 5 vidhayakon ko lagata he ki AAP ko samarthan dene kaa faisla uchit he
 On the issue of support, the names of former ministers Harun Yusuf, Arvinder Singh Lovely and Jaikishan have emerged among the dissident mlas
 aam aadmi party ke mantrimandal gathan se pehle hi badi siyaasi halchal much gai he
 Earlier, Congress Spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi said that a great deal of Congress is not happy with supporting AAP
 janardan dvivedi ne press conference karke bataaya ki party ke senior leaderon kaa ek bada tabaka maanata he ki AAP samarthan dene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 However, he indicated that the Congress would continue to play a limited 'opposition role' in the Delhi Assembly
 itnaa hi nahin, janardan dvivedi ne ek kadam aage badhkar paroksh rup se AAP par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki 'atvaad' or 'aatankwaad' main zyada fark nahin hota he
 He said that the Congress never takes an extreme stand
 duusari ore, AAP ke bheetar bhi sarkaar banane se pehle hi 'baghawat' ke sur sunai padane lage hai
 MLA Vinod Binny of AAP is said to be very upset after not getting his name in the list of potential ministers
 vinod binni ne mangalvaar raat ko kaha ki unke anubhav ke baavjood mantrimandal main jagah na die jane se ve kaaphi dukhi he
 He said, 'I have been insulted
 main kal bada faisla karuunga
 'it is understood that Binny can make a' big bang 'by holding a press conference on Wednesday
 jaankaree ke mutabik, binni ko samajhane ke kaam main party ke senior leader manish sisodiya or yogendra yadav ko lagaaya gaya he
 The controversy arose when the names of potential ministers of the Kejriwal cabinet came up in the media
 mantriyon kii list main jagah nahin milane ke baad vinod binni ne mangalvaar shaam ko kejariwal se mulaakaat kii
 The two talked for less than 10 minutes

 However, the political turmoil is at its peak in Delhi

 President Ram Nath Kovind has dismissed a petition seeking disqualification of 11 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) mlas for allegedly holding posts of profit
 ise aap ke liye raahat mana ja rahaa he
 The Election Commission said that the President's decision of October 28 is based on the opinion given by him (the Commission)
 is ghatnakram par pratikriya jaahir karte hue dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya, 'satyamev jayate
 Eventually, Satya wins

 https: / / t
 co / pr4cg5qbum In March 2017, a person named Vivek Garg filed a petition before the President seeking to disqualify 11 AAP mlas including Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot for membership of the Legislative Assembly
 unka daawa tha ki dilli ke 11 jilon main jila aapadaa prabandhan praadhikaranon kaa sah adhyaksh hone ke naate ye sabhi vidhayak laabh ke pad par asin hai
 The issue was referred to the Election Commission which opined in August that being the co-chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority does not disqualify him as an MLA as he does not get remuneration in the form of salary, allowances, fees etc
 uske alaava unhen staff car, karyaalay kaa sthaan, karmchaaree, telephan yaa nivas bhi nahin diye gayi hai
 According to the law, the President accepts the opinion of the Election Commission on matters of office of profit
 ayog ne kaha ki dilli vidhansabha sadsy (ayogy paye jane par sadsyta se vanchit) adhinium, 1997 dilli sarkaar dwaara gathit sanvidhik yaa gaiyr sanvidhik nikaay ke adhyaksh, nideshak yaa sadsy ke pad ko chhot pradaan karata he basharte ukt adhyaksh, nideshak yaa sadsy kisi paarishramik kaa hakdaar na ho
 The petitioner has legislators - Sanjeev Jha (burari), Nitin Tyagi (laxmi Nagar), Praveen Kumar (jangpura), Pawan Kumar Sharma (adarsh nagar), Sridutt Sharma (ghonda), Rajesh Gupta (wazirpur), Sarita Singh (rohtash Nagar) , Dinesh Mohania (sangam Vihar), Amanatullah Khan (okhla), Kailash Gehlot (najafgarh) and Jarnail Singh (tilak Nagar) were disqualified

 After facing criticism from several places, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the ambitious campaign to make Delhi Metro's ten stations 'cashless' was put on the back burner
 dilli metro rail nigam (dmarsi) ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki maujuuda rup main petm jaisi i-wolet companiyon kaa istemaal rojaanaa aadhaar par hone vaale lenden ke bade aakaar ke kaaran metro pranali main istemaal karne ke hisaab se 'upyukt nahin he
 'kejriwal had questioned the decision to involve Paytm in the process and said that he would demand an inquiry as well as look at related files

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) a senior official of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that currently the use of e-wallet companies like Paytm is not 'suitable' for use in the metro system due to the large size of transactions done on a daily basis
 ' kejariwal ne prakriya main petm ko shaamil karne ke faisle par sawaal kiya tha or kaha tha ki vah jaanch kii maang karenge or saath hi sambandhit filein dekhenge

 a special cell of Delhi Police put some mobile numbers in Dubai and Karachi on surveillance in view of concerns related to the security of the country
 shaq tha ki in numberon ke log bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaadi sajeesh rach rahe hai
 Despite monitoring throughout the month, the police could not get any strong news in this regard
 lekin is bich record 100 ghante se bhi zyada kii baatcheet main ipiel, bhai, buki, target sareekhe shabd baar-baar sunne ko mili
 It seemed that there might be a plan to attack a big city during IPL
 duusare str par nigaraanee shuru hui
 Suddenly in the third week of April, the police were shocked
 yah to ipiel-6 ke dauraan chal rahaa antarrashtriya betting syndicate tha
 To get the picture clearer, a bookie's phone was taken on surveillance
 are! uskaa taalluk to rajasthan royles ke spinner ajit chandila se tha
 Then what was there! As soon as Chandila's phone was taken on surveillance, a clear mirror picture was revealed
 ipiel main yah spot phixing kii taiyaari thi, vah bhi andervalrd kii taraf se
 Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar finally exploded in a press conference last Thursday by announcing that apart from Chandila, the controversial Indian cricket bowlers Sreesanth and Ankit Chauhan were involved in spot-fixing
 sansanikhej ballebaaj kris gail ke jhannatedaar chhakkon or rajasthan royles ke captain rahul dravid kii captaini par nyochhavar ho rahe duniya bhar ke cricket premiyon ko jaise saanp soongh gaya
 After that, as the process of questioning and investigation progressed, the spot-fixing acts of these cricketers in association with the underworld came to light that people pressed their fingers under the teeth
 khud police ko bhi kam jhatka nahin laga
 Neeraj Kumar, Commissioner of Delhi Police, who has been the victim of criticisms for a long time, has fulfilled the wishes of his wish
 darasal police ko dubai ke ek number se ho rahi baatcheet par shaq hua
 And when this number was taken on surveillance, the police got such a lot of information, which was more than he had expected
 ab dilli police ke varisht adhikari khud maidan main baithkar najar rakhane lage
 Actually it was also necessary to do this because gestures are very important in the world of spot fixing
 kisi over main no ball daalane, ek over main khub ran lutaaney, wide gend karne yaa bounsar daalane tak kii spot phixing hoti he
 The fixer makes some gestures before putting his over so that the bookie sitting in the field can inform his bosses in time
 kabhi vah cap ke peeche chashma lagaataa he, kabhi vah juute kaa feeta baandhta he
 If needed, the extender asks for a water bottle
 yani spot phixing ko pakadia bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 Delhi Police got the fruits of this hard work soon
 16 may ko mumbai main rajasthan royles ke teen gendbaaj srisanth, ajit chandila or ankit chavaan jab munh par kaala kapadaa daale dilli police kii giraft main dikhe to logon ke jehan main 15 may kii der raat tak chale mumbai or rajasthan ke kaante ke match kaa swaad kasaiyla ho gaya
 In fact, by then the Delhi Police had arrested 11 bookies along with these three players and revealed the biggest spot fixing racket in the IPL
 inamen se ek satoria amit singh khud bhi cricketer he or pichley saal tak rajasthan royles team kaa hissaa hua karata tha
 At the same time, the bookie Jeeju, who is the head of this whole case, has also played club cricket with Sreesanth and is now involved in betting
 ipiel-6 kaa yah khulaasa duniya bhar main faile cricket match phixing ke 40,000 karod ru
 The annual episode was the latest link in the infamous business
 aankade kaa yah anumaan police ne bookies se poochtacha se mili jaankaree ke aadhaar par lagaaya he
 But indicating where this link will go, Kumar said in a packed press conference, "A lot of new things will come out after questioning the arrested people
 isse na sirf andervalrd ke shikanje kii baat pataa chalegi balki pataa chalegaa ki ipiel main phixing kii jaden kahaan tak faili hai
 The Delhi Police claims that it has hundreds of hours of recordings of conversations between the players and the bookies
 jaanch kaa silsilaa aage bad chukaa he
 According to police sources, soon many team owners and players will be asked
 udhar yah bhi khabar he ki amit singh ne police kii poochtacha main ballebaaj bread hoj or ajinkya rahane ke naam bhi uchhaale hai
 These batsmen will also be under questioning soon
 bisisiai ne amit singh ko suspend bhi kar diya he
 But the question is, why did the players slip away despite a good career and huge amount of money in IPL? Friend made fixer Police sources believe that Sreesanth, who initially denied the spot-fixing allegations at the beginning, finally broke down in front of the police questions
 went
 srisanth ne mana ki dost or cricketer jiju janardan ke chakkar main padakar vah spot phixing ke daldal main utar gaya
 However, Sreesanth's lawyer has claimed that Sreesanth is immaculate
 kis kaa daawa sahi he yah to adaalat tay karegi, lekin is puure maamle main jiju dilachasp kirdaar banakar ubhara he
 Jiju Sreesanth was a distant relative and once his partner in club level cricket
 srisanth jahaan cricket kii duniya main jhande gaadte chale gaye, vahiin jiju ne dubai kaa rukh kiya or vahaan ke cricket match phixing sindicket se jud gaya
 In the latest case too, Jiju met Jupiter code-named bookies several times in Mumbai and then conspired for fixing through bookie Chand Bhai
 usee ne srisanth kii mulaakaat ek bade satorie se karai
 The police allege that the young players Chandila and Chavan came in contact with these books only at the behest of Sreesanth
 jiju ne in donon khiladinnon ko bataaya ki spot phixing kitni aasaan he
 50-60 lakhs just by throwing a no ball
 kamaaye ja sakate hai
 These boys, who came from families of modest financial condition, were blinded by money and they got caught in the trap of crime
 paise ke saath husn kaa bhi laga bazarasb ko pataa he ki daan ke saath dakshina kaa rivaaj bada purana he
 Speculators also know this very well
 isiilie khiladinnon ko phixing kii rakam dene ke saath hi ladkiyaan bhi muhaiyaa karai gayi
 According to police sources, when Sreesanth was arrested from a hideout in Mumbai Carter Road area in the early hours of 16 May, he was accompanied by a girl
 hotel inter continental ke baahar se giraftaar kiye gaye chandila ke saath ek ladki kii maujuudagi kii baat police ne kahi he
 Both these players were with these girls overnight and the car was using the bookies sent by them
 police ke record bataate hai ki rajasthan royles ke ek or khilaadi ne bhi satorion se apane liye ladkiyaan supplai karai thim
 However, his name has not surfaced at the moment in spot-fixing
 teenon khiladinnon ko phixing ke daldal main fansaane vaala jiju khud bhi satorion se ladkiyaan mangaata tha
 a girl was also present with Jiju at the time of arrest
 yani rasrang kaa puraa intjaam kar rakhaa tha satorion ne
 The underworld was ready to play big game when the underworld players were drunken with youthfulness and wealth
 noujvaan cricketer jahaan no ball kar yaa looj ball daalkar chakke padwane main lakhon rupye kamakar khud ko maalamaal samaj rahe the, vahiin dur dubai main baithe andervalrd sargana unki in khatarnaak naadaniyon se karodon ke vaare-nyaare kar rahe the
 When the devils of the underworld sitting in Dubai came to know that the fast trio of Rahul Dravid's team of Indian cricket has come under their grip, they opened the dam of the spot-fixing business
 yahaan khilaadi jis beyimaani ke liye 60 lakh rupye le rahaa tha, vahiin satorie is par 20-20 karod ke daanv par haath saaf karne lage
 But in the heat of the summer, the rain of the money reached the Delhi Police
 yahaan boliyaan lag rahi thim or vahaan police phone tanping ke jariye saboot badhaati ja rahi thi
 In fact, in every major match of cricket, between Rs 1,000 and 5,000 crore
 kaa satta lagata he or yah rakam hawala ke jariye ek haath se duusare haath pahunchati he
 Its opening strand connects with the same infamous Dawood Ibrahim, who has not seen the face of India for over two decades, but continues to rule in the dark streets here
 phixing kaa daaud yugafixing kii kahani puraani ho chali he
 Dawood arrived in Dubai in the early nineties
 takreeban is samay cricket bhi registan kaa rukh kar chukaa tha
 india-pakistan matches started in Sharjah
 match hit sabit hue
 Dawood appears in Sharjah only after escaping from Mumbai
 yaheen match dekhte hue uski ve charchit tasviren khinchin gayi jinamein vah bade rob se stadium main baitha dikhataa he
 Dawood was sitting in the field and his mind was thinking about auctioning the game outside the ground
 daaud ne satte or match phixing ke cocktail ko cricket kii nai rangini ke saath jod diya
 Now how the players play on the field, how the d-company would decide
 match phixing or satte ke liye van-de idial cricket tha
 Instant results and instant earnings in a single day
 dhandha joro par tha
 As the business progressed, the syndicate came forward
 sabase bada sindicket daaud ibrahim kaa finance sanbhaalane vaala sharad shetty chalaata tha
 To dominate the betting, Chhota Rajan shot Shetty at the India Club in Dubai
 lekin 2005 aate-aate shetty kaa kaam mumbai main kolaba ke rahane vaale ek vyapaaree sunil abhichandani urf sunil dubai ne sambhala
 It is said that Sunil Dubai is directly linked to Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim and together they are running South Asia's biggest cricket betting cartel
 sutron ke mutabik, sunil is vakt 43 street, emirates gas stesan, mankhul dubai se operat kar rahaa he
 Many cases against Sunil are also registered in Mumbai Crime Branch
 isi sindicket ke liye 20-20 maichon kaa janm kisi man maangi muraad ke puure hone se kam nahin rahaa
 IPL did wonders on him
 ek hi din main do-do maichon kaa majaa
 On top of that, not only one country, but world famous players on the same pitch
 satta lagane ke liye isse zyada masaaledaar cheez or kya ho sakati thi?lalit modi ko hui thi peshkashipiel ke sansthaapak purv kamishnar lalit modi bhi is baat se ittefaq rakhte hai
 According to Modi, when he was the commissioner, he was constantly harassing the bookies of Pakistan and Dubai
 unke upar sattebaaji main shaamil hone yaa sattebaajon ko aasaani se apana kaam karne dene kaa dabaav tha
 It is a different matter that Modi, who was exiled from the IPL due to allegations of white money in Hawala through hawala himself, says never to bow down to these bookies
 modi ne kya kiya, yah to vahi jaane lekin sattebaaj apana dhandha chalaane ke liye kisi ek aadmi ke bharose kabhi nahin rahe
 According to sources, there are many faces of the underworld on the radar of Delhi Police
 lekin abhi kisi bhi chehre kii mukammal pahchaan nahin ho saki he
 Most of the numbers he tracked and took them under scrutiny are either from Dubai or other Gulf countries
 jaahir he, aise main un numberon ke peeche chupe hue chehron kii pahchaan karne main abhi police ko thodaa vakt lag saktaa he kyonki yah kaam akele dilli police ke bas kaa bhi nahin he
