 abu azmi se dhakka-mukkiitna hi nahin abu ke haath se mike chin liya gaya or dhakkamukki bhi gai
 It is being said that an MNS MLA also kicked Azmi

 The latest example of how sensitive the government and administration is to crime is seen in Hapur
 yahaan 48 ghante ke andar dakaiti or gangrape kii do ghatnaayen huin
 The special thing is that the method of crime is similar in both
 jaahir he yah tabhi sambhav he jab apradhi ek ho
 Although the police have taken action and arrested one of the accused in the case, the question is that if the police took action only after the first incident, then the second incident could not be avoided
 yah sach us pradesh kaa he jahaan pichley kuch dinon main sadak se lekar ped tak aparaadh kii saakh majboot hui he, baavjood iske police or sarkaar khamosh he
 On July 19 in Hapur, gang-rape occurred after the robbery in Narayanpur village of Dholana

 The miscreants adopted the same method of assault at both places
 pulisia karrwai kii baat karen to pehali ghatana ke baad maamla darj kar aropiyon kii talash shuru kii gai
 But after the second incident, the police started breathing and just to relieve themselves, the Hafizpur police station and the Crime Branch team arrested one of the accused Usman after the encounter
 police kaa kahana he aaropee osman janapad hapur ke thana pilkhuva ke dehpa kaa rahane vaala he
 The accused confessed that he was accompanied by 8 other people involved in both the incidents
 sirf mahilaon ko banaate the shikargiraftaar ke baad shuruaati poochtacha main osman ne jo kuch bataaya he vah aparaadhiyon ke buland hausale kii daastaan he
 According to the police, Usman said that apart from these two incidents, his gang has also committed many incidents
 yahi nahin gang main osman sahit teen badmaash aise hai jo sirf mahilaon ko apana shikaar banaate the
 These poor had no meaning with money
 gang 'chamadi hamaari, damadi tumhaari' kii niti par kaam karata tha
 Usman has named his two other companions Rashid and Jallu
 osman kii giraftaar ke baad police apni peeth jarur thapthapa rahi he, lekin asal main pehali ghatana ke baad yah prashasnic laaparvaahee kaa nateeja he jisane duusare aparaadh ko nyotaa diya
 Currently, the police is eyeing 8 absconding criminals

 But they also have helplessness
 in das saalon kii satta main se lagbhag aath saal aise rahe jab bijepi nitish sarkaar kaa hissaa rahi
 If Nitish Kumar counts the work of the initial five years, then the BJP will have to give half the credit directly and if the book is kept for five years of the second term, then the credit of bjp's share also comes to the fore
 itnaa hin nahin, un jithan ram maanjhi ke kaam ko bhi nazarandaaz karke report card bananaa he jo ab NDA kaa hissaa hai
 And so Nitish ji has put more power on issues like DNA, mess of center package and word withdrawal
 itnaa hi nahin, ek dikkat or he unki ki jis lalu yadav ke jangal raaj se bachaane kaa maseehaa wo khud ko bataakar lagaataar vikaas purush kaa tamgaa hasil karte rahe wo lalu ji bhi ab unheen kii naav par baithe hai
 This means that the issue also went away by hand
 udhar, bijepi kii dikkat bhi kamobesh nitish ji jaisi hi he
 If she rejects Nitish Kumar's work completely, she also rejects her own work done by staying with him
 beete do saal ke kaam ko khaarij karti he to phir un jithan ram maanjhi ke kaam ko kachare main phenk detii he jise usne is chunaav main apana saathi bana rakhaa he
 And if the work of the center is counted then people can ask where are the good days and black money brother? That is, there is no other option for the BJP than to contest elections by calling Nitish Kumar a fraud and opportunistic? uff!! koun kahata he ki shina vora murder cese hi bahut ulajhaa hua he
 Issues in Bihar elections are more or less the same
 jo parampara kaa hissaa he wo is bihar chunaav kaa hissaa nahin he
 And that's why the voters of Bihar, who are considered politically aware, have to understand that in Bihar with a literacy of around 61 percent, where 40 percent of the population does not directly understand what DNA is and in the remaining 61 percent of the population
 Even the data of those who know about DNA will not be very big, why is there the issue of DNA election being made or being made
 chunaav kaa DNA bhale gadabada rahaa ho lekin agar voting kaa DNA nahin gadbadaaye or vikaas or sirf vikaas ko dekhakar hin vot paden to sab khud ba khud sulajh jayega
 To understand broadly, suppose that DNA, ie Deoxyribonucleic acid, actually contains biological information and carries forward genetic goodness or evil
 yani aasaan he, chunaav kaa bhi DNA hota hoga to jo saalon se ek chunaav kii mote taurapar rup rekha hoti hogi use aage badhaata hoga
 That is, there should be an opposition that makes the ruling party count, the ruling party should count its own good and work and after hearing all this, the voters can vote
 lekin mote taur par agar kisi chunaav kaa yahi DNA hota he to bihar ke chunaav kaa DNA to puraa gadabada gaya lagata he
 Now you see for yourself, the opposition (lalu Yadav) who has been out of power for the last ten years and he should count the shortcomings of power the most by law, he is praising the ruling party by beating his heart
 RJD ke har netaa ne man main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar kii bakhiya udhedane ke liye na jane kitne alankaaron se susajjit bayaan taiyaar rakhe honge, lekin sab dhare ke dhare rah gaye
 Political compulsion is that party chief Lalu Yadav had mistaken Nitish Kumar just before the election, from worker to spokesperson
 
 Not everyone wants it, he is busy praising Nitishji
 ab bihar chunaav ke DNA kaa ek doosraa gadabadaya pahalu bhi samaj lijie
 Nitish Kumar, who has been in the Chief Minister's chair for nearly nine years out of ten, instead of counting his work, is busy counting how the Prime Minister sitting at the center has cheated the people of the country and now how to cheat Bihar Have been
 par unki bhi majaburi he
 Out of these ten years in power, almost eight years were when the BJP was part of the Nitish government
 nitish kumaar agar shuruuaati paanch saal ke kaamkaaj ko ginate hai to sidhe-sidhe aadha shrey bijepi ko bhi dena hoga or agar duusare kaarykaal ke paanch saal kaa hisaab kitaab rakhte hai to bhi bijepi ke hisse kaa shrey saamne aa khadaa hota he
 Not only this, the work of those Jeetan Ram Manjhi is also to ignore and make report cards which are now part of the NDA
 or isliye satta paksh yani nitish ji ne zyada takat DNA, kendra ke package kaa gadabadjhaalaa or shabd vaapasi jaise muddon par jhonk rakhi he
 Not only this, another problem is that Lalu Yadav, the messiah of saving himself from the jungle rule, continued to achieve the title of development man by telling himself that Lalu ji is now sitting on his boat
 matlab ye ki wo mudda bhi gaya haath se
 On the other hand, bjp's problem is more or less same as Nitish ji
 wo nitish kumaar ke kaam ko sire se khaarij karti he to unke saath rahakar kiye khud ke kaam ko bhi nakaar detii he
 If he rejects the work of the last two years, then he throws the work of those Jeetan Ram Manjhi whom he has made his partner in this election
 or agar kendra ke kaam ko ginaati he to log puch sakate hai ki achche din or kaala dhan kahaan hai bhai? yani bijepi ke liye nitish kumaar ko dhokhebaaz or maukaparast bataakar chunaav ladane ke alaava or kya vikalp rah jaataa he?tippaniyan Oops! Who says that Sheena Vora Murder Case is very complicated
 bihar chunaav main muddon kaa bhi kamobesh yahi haal he
 Which is part of the tradition is not part of this Bihar election
 or isiilie raajnneetik rup se jaagruk maane jane vaale bihar ke voter ko samajhnaa hoga ki takreeban 61 fisadi kii sakshartaa vaale bihar main, jahaan 40 fisadi aabaadi to sidhe-sidhe ye nahin samajhati ki DNA hota kya he or jo baaki kii 61 fisadi aabaadi he usamen se bhi DNA ke bare main jaankaree rakhane waalon kaa bhi aankada bahut bada nahin hoga, vahaan DNA chunaav kaa mudda kyon ban rahaa he yaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The election DNA may be messing up, but if the voting DNA is not messed up and votes are given only by looking at development and development, then everything will be solved automatically
 ab aap khud dekhie, jo vipaksh (lalu yadav) beete das saal se satta se baahar he or use kaayade se sabase zyada satta kii kamiyaan ginani chahie, wo man markar satta paksh kii taareef kar rahaa he
 Every leader of the RJD must have kept in mind how many elaborate statements are prepared to unleash Nitish Kumar's government
 , but all of them remained 
 siyasat kii majaburi he ki party pramukh lalu yadav ne chunaav se ain pehle nitish kumaar se galabahiyaan kar leen, to kaaryakarta se lekar pravaktaa tak
 
 sab chahen na chahen, nitish ji kii taareef main jute hai

 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle haryana main jind upachunaav main congress kaa trump card nahin chal paaya
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress's attempt to create a winning rhythm in Haryana failed and thus the defeat of Randeep Surjewala has given a big blow to the Congress
 haryana main sattarudh bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne jind vidhansabha seat ke upachunaav kii guuruuvaar ko jari matganana main jeet hasil kar lee he
 According to the way the Congress was prepared in Jind, it seemed that Randeep Surjewala would do something amazing and emerge as a silver lining for the Congress in Haryana politics
 magar haryana ke jind main surajevaala vah itihaas dohraane main naakaamayaab rahe, jisaki ummid congress party ko thi
 In fact, after 1972, no Jat candidate has won the election in Jind
 randeep surajevaala kii ummidavaari se aisa lag rahaa tha ki jind kaa yah record tut jayega is baar, magar aaj bhi jat samudaay kaa koi netaa nahin jeet paaya or yah record kaayam rah gaya
 Let us know that Randeep Surjewala is a veteran Congress leader and comes from the Jat community
 randeep surajevaala jind vidhansabha upachunaav main tisare number par rahe
 In Jind assembly election, BJP candidate Krishna Lal Middha won by 12248 votes
 jananaayak janata party (jejepi) ke digvijay singh chautaala duusare number par rahe
 That is BJP number one, JJP number two and Congress number three
 pichley do chunaavon main is seat par vijeta rahi indian neshnal lokdal (inelo) is baar apana jamaanat bhi jabt hone se nahin bachaa pai
 The INLD fielded Umed Singh as its candidate
 do baar ke inelo vidhayak hari chand midda ke nidhan ke baad upachunaav hua he jinke bete krishna midda bhaajapa ke tikat par chunavi maidan main utre
 Voting for the by-election was held on January 28 with 1
 72 lakh matadaataaon main se lagbhag 76 pratishat ne apane matadhikaar kaa prayog kiya tha
 This election was a test for all four major parties ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and the recently established Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) in view of Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 kise mili kitne vot:inelo - 3454 Congress - 22740 bijepi - 50566 Jjp - 37631 LSP - 13582 Nota - 345 gauratlab he ki kuch din pehle hi kailash vijayawargeey ke bete akaash jo ki vidhayak hai, ne ek adhikari par bat se hamalaa kar diya tha
 After the video of the incident went viral, a case was registered against Akash and he was arrested
 vahiin is ghatana ke baad bijepi kii kaaphi fajihat hui or baad main sutron ne khabar di ki grahamantri amit shah ne ghatana kii report maangi he
 At the same time, the officer who was attacked by Akash had to be hospitalized due to blood pressure and stress

 Criminals have been using AK47 many times over the years
 mujffarpur main purv meyar samir kumaar kii hatya main eke47 kaa istemaal kiya gaya

 Some of the boxes dropped with parachutes included 300 AK 47 and AK 56 rifles made in Bulgaria, about 15,000 bullets, half a dozen rocket launchers, grenades, pistols and dark sighting devices
 aise ye hathiyaar kai aparaadhiyon ke haath lag gaye the
 But even then, these deadly weapons have been sold to criminals of Bihar, smuggled from Nepal and Bangladesh
 lekin mujffarpur kaa taaja maamla behad chaunkaane vaala he
 Whose connection is from Jabalpur

 Purushottam and Suresh used to steal the AK47 from COD and bring it to Munger separately
 vahiin use asembal kiya jaataa tha
 Again criminals and Naxalites were sold
 munger ke espi baburam ke mutabik purushottam ne 60 se 70 eke47 bihar main bechi hai
 6 people have been arrested in this case
 purushottam or suresh ko jabalpur se giraftaar kiya gaya tha

 Therefore, the investigation of the police is moving towards there
 philhal, police samir kumaar ke hatyaron kii talash kar rahi he
 According to experts, the ground dispute may also be a reason behind this murder

 He said that under this scheme every child will have a unique number
 lekin isamen koi biometric data shaamil nahin hoga (jaisaa ki aadhaar main hota he)
 The official said, 'we are planning to create a database that will track the child from birth to employment
 yah database bachche ke swasthya sambandhi muddon ko dekhegaa
 The same data can then be used by the Ministry of Women and Child Development
 saath hi unhone kaha ki yah unic number bacchon ke skool se sambandhit aankadon se joda jayega
 Unique number will be given on the birth of children, describing it as the only tracker and separate from Aadhaar, the official said that this idea has been received positively by all ministries
 isamen ham aadhaar kaa upyog nahin karenge
 This is a unique number that will be created by the Health Department on the birth of a child
 or jab bachche ko aadhaar number milegaa, to ise aadhaar se joda jayega
 He said that there would be no biometric authentication as in the case of Aadhaar
 unhone kaha ki iskaa uddeshyabache kesamgr vikaas ko trek karnaa he

 parikshaayen khatm huin or besabri se parinaam kaa intajaar hone laga
 We did not get any clue as to what happened, even after doing a lot of laxity, intelligence
 parinaam ghoshit hone se kuch din pehle ladi shriram college ne staff kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala
 The college was opened in the same year (1956)
 aanan-faanan main lagbhag aakasmik rup se uske khulne kii bhi ek kahani thi
 It was being said that if a financial crisis arose in the city’s oldest girls ’college‘ Indraprastha ’

 ke maalik shahar ke vikhyath poonjipati sar shriram ne college kii gavarning body ke sadsy kii haisiyat se use sankat se ubaarane kii peshkash kii
 Provided that the name of the college is changed to 'lady Shri Ram College'
 baaki ke sadasyon main bhi shahar ke kuch puraane rais or pratishthit log the
 He objected to this proposal
 suna yah gaya ki sar shriram us meeting se yah chunauti dekar baahar nikle ki ve jitna paisa dene ko taiyaar hai, utane main ve chahen to nayaa college khol sakate hai
 And they will show by doing so
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone prastaavit college ke liye indraprastha college kii hi ek puraani praadhyapika dow
 After contacting Homai Dastur, he made him ready for the post of Principal
 dow
 Dastur lived in Bombay at that time
 main apane onors ke samay unki chaatra rahi zarur thi, jisaki unhen yaad rahane kaa koi sawaal nahin tha, kyonki vakt kaaphi guzar chukaa tha or hindi onors ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye angrezi mahaz sabsediri vishay hota tha,jiskaa nipataara pehle saal main hi ho jaataa tha
 i definitely remembered that she was a very smart and tough-tempered woman
 unka naam sunakar ghabrahat-si zarur hui, lekin yah vishwaas bhi jagaa ki ve surat-sirat or kaabiliat ko mahatva dengi
 Sir Shriram too, whom people called 'sir' less, 'lala ji' more, was very famous for his unbiased quality
 isliye puri noummidi kaa alam nahin tha
 Actually we, like novices, were busy cooking Khayali casserole
 is baat kii jaankaree zarur ho gai thi ki em
 a
 main pratham shrenee aane par, der-saver, kahin-na-kahin naukari kaa jugad baith hi jaataa he
 The advertisement first came from Lady Shri Ram College
 us samay tak pariksha-parinaam nahin aayaa tha
 There was a panic in the stomach
 is baat kaa andaaza tha ki moderation ho chukaa he, isliye adhyaksh or cameti ke sadasyon ko pratham shrenee waalon kii jaankaree zarur hogi
 Nobody dared to ask
 mujhe chaturaai suujhi
 One day, Dr
 sahab ke yahaan pesh hokar maine unhen vigyaapan kii soochna dete hue badi vinamrata se poocha ki agar ve anumati den to main applai kar duun
 Goddess! Let the first result come
 ’ uttar aisi nirvikaar mudra or kadak awaz main mila ki mere hosh faakhtaa ho gaye
 When i mentioned this to Jain Saheb, he reacted in the same senseless mood, 'you should not have gone
 unhen jaanati nahin ho kya?’dow
 i almost assumed that my result was not very favorable, because the pamphlets were good
 parinaam do-teen din baad aa gaya
 There were a total of four first-class recipients
 santosh kaa sthaan pehla tha, meraa teesraa
 The situation between the two was highly unpredictable
 usne yon bhi padhai chhodkar gruhasthi main pravesh kar liya
 i again Dr
 sahab ke paas gai, form bharne ke baad—testimonial lene
 i got a very cold reply, 'come and take it tomorrow
 ’ mudra utani hi nirvikaar
 If the prize comes in hand, its language is equally neutral, formal, like any president can write and hold any student! As a student, there is no mention of my immediate activeness and regular presence in literary, cultural programs of the department
 mujhe niraashaa nahin hui, yah kahana beyimaani hogi, kyonki usase kahin behatar pramaan-patr to misses sinha ne diya tha
 i concluded from my understanding that he once again became the Head of the Department of Civil and Civil Affairs
 unke man main kya chal rahaa tha, iskaa andaaza to baad main hua, jab college main intervyuu orniyukti kaa avasar aayaa
 It is a different matter that this whole episode instilled in me the discretion to understand and examine human nature, which remained with us in the future
 shriram college ke khulne kii prakriya varsh 1956 kii garmiyon main shuru hui
 At that time there were only two colleges for girls in the city - Indraprastha and Miranda
 indraprastha kaa namakaran to nagar ke pracheen naam kaa aadhunik avataran tha
 'miranda' was named after the daughter of Sir Morris Gwyer, the university's noted chancellor
 us samay yah sambhav tha, kisi ne aapatti nahin kii, goki college swatantra bharat main khulaa tha
 The money did not belong to any individual or trust — it was the government through the university
 baad main aise prastaavon ke karyanvayan main dikkatein aane lageen
 When noted economist Dr

 V
 raav dilli vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati hue to unhone daulataraam trust kaa prastaav is shart ke saath sweekaar kiya tha ki unke dwaara khole janevaale college kaa naam unki divangat patni pramila ke naam par rakhaa jaae
 And the college opened as 'premila College'
 yah baad kii baat he ki dow
 In the absence of Rao's vice-chancellor, the trust passed a resolution and changed his name to the name of the founder - 'daulatram College'
 par jab baat ladi shriram college khulne kii uthi to aisi koi baadha nahin thi
 He also provided the financial basis for the trust the college proposed
 darasal sar shriram kii hasti nagar ke un puunjipatiyon main thi jinhone udyog kii duniya main hi nahin, shiksha ke kshetra main bhi badi khyaati pai thi
 He was the founder of Shri Ram College of Commerce, besides being the chairman or member of the governing bodies of Indraprastha College, Hindu College and Ramjas College from time to time
 iske alaava, unhone dilli vishvavidhyalay main shriram research centre ke naam se ek shodh-kendra kii sthapana kii, jo aaj bhi mukhya vishvavidhyalay maarg par sthit or sakriy he
 Even after that, this tradition was maintained by his descendants - for a long time
 vishvavidhyalayan shiksha main hi nahin, us parivaar ne schuli shiksha main bhi ruchi lekar sar shriram ke naam par dilli main jo skool kholaa, uski shakhaaen gudgaanv main bhi lahalha rahi hai
 Lalaji did not delay in realizing his interest and resolve
 unhone aanan-faanan main dow
 Contacted Homai Dastur
 unhen dilli bulaakar college ke principal kaa daayitv saunpa or college ke liye praadhyapikaon kii bhartee kii prakriya shuru kar di
 Lalaji lived at that time on the family's 20 Kazarn Road (which later came to be known as Kasturba Gandhi Marg)
 college ke liye us samay dariyaganj kii kotwali ke peeche commercial skool kii imaarat tay kar di gai
 Lalaji did not want to postpone his plan at any cost
 us imaarat main jagah simit hi thi
 a large courtyard in the middle, around which there are large class-rooms in the corridors
 baahar bada-sa phatak, jisamen teen-chaar seedhiyaan chadhate hi daaen-baayen galiyare shuru ho jate the
 a small room in the corner of the corridor on the right, containing the principal's office and some of the first large rooms in the college's The $ ft
 bain taraf kakshaon ke liye apekshaakrit bade kamaron kii qatari shuru ho jaati thi
 First year, because admission B
 e
 Was to be in the first year of the year and the number was not expected to be very large, so there was no possibility of any problem
 bhavishya ke liye lalaji ne man-hi-man sankalp kar rakhaa tha ki college se bi
 a
 kii degree lenevaala pehla batch college kii nai imaarat se nikalegaa
 The college also had a hallowed large room with stage facilities where a morning meeting of all the professors and students was held, which the principal addressed
 baad main isi sabha main baari-baari se praadhyapikaon main se koi ek, vidhyaarthiyon ke liye aacharan yaa gyaan-sambandhi kisi chune hue uddhran kaa paath karti thim or aavashyak suchnaayen di jaati thim
 This tradition went on for years
 ab kya hota he, nahin jaanati
 The time would have been the second or third week of June when interviews started for the appointment of professors
 college main nahin—lalaji ke nivas-sthaan par
 When i got the newsletter of the interview, i was more nervous than happy in response
 ghar-parivaar main koi aisa nahin tha jo isamen koi maargdarshan karata
 Dr
 sahab se sidhe kuch poochne kii himmat nahin thi
 When i knocked on the door on the pretext of giving information, the same neutral neutral response in response, 'yes, i know
 
 
 thik he
 
 to phir aao intervyuu main
 'I dared to know that some special preparation would have to be done? Then the same formal rude,' What to do separately! Whatever is read and written will work
 ’mere farishte bhi yah anumaan nahin laga sakate the ki unke man main kya chal rahaa he
 i returned and again reversed the notes which were prepared for the exam and left it to the rest
 niyat tithi or samay par kazarn road pahunche to us kamare main pahunchate hi, jahaan abhyarthiyon ko baithaaya gaya tha
 The ground under the foot slipped
 kul milakar chhbbees log aae the
 Most arrived before us
 kyonki baahar se aanewaalon kii sankhya zyaada thi
 We were the only two from Delhi - me and Santosh
 aapasi baatcheet main pataa laga ki un bhanti-bhanti kii murtiyon main do-teen to collejon kii principal hi thim or shesh main se adhikansh ko do-chaar saal padhaane kaa anubhav tha
 Obviously, everyone is older and more experienced than us
 hamane maan liya ki hamaara koi chance nahin he
 This realization also freed us to some extent
 bhavishya ke liye intervyuu kaa anubhav hi ekmaatr uplabdhi hoti dikhaai pad rahi thi
 When the voice started to sound, the two names were called together
 vyavastha yah thi ki jab pehle kaa saakshaatkaar chal rahaa ho to doosraa kamare ke baahar bani gailaree main kursi par virajman rahakar apni baari kii pratiksha kare
 Because there was a distance between the rooms in that huge kothi, it took a lot of time to walk through the door in that hallowed room to reach the chair in front of the committee
 is vyavastha se samiti ke samay kii kuch bachat ho jaati thi
 My number was twenty-fourth
 mujhe laga ki suchi main kram, aanewaalon kii yogyata ke hisaab se tay kiya gaya hoga
 Therefore, mind-to-mind was almost certain of its status and status
 jo andar jaataa, baaki bache besabri se uski pratiksha karte
 On returning, he would try to get information about the inner environment and the nature of the questions
 zaahir he, puraa sach koi bolnaa nahin chahta tha
 The exact information was only counted and structured by the board members
 ganimat yah thi ki haul ke baahar baithe vyakti ko yah to pataa lagata tha ki baatcheet kab jari or kab khatm hui, byora samaj main nahin aata tha
 With which applicant the committee took so long, we were all trying unsuccessfully to assess his situation
 badi vyagrata or kautuhal kii mili-juli man: sthiti main pratiksha kii ghadiyaan cat rahi thim
 The biggest surprise was waiting inside the room
 aavedak kii kursi ke thik saamne, ardhachandrakaar khidki ke neeche baithne kii jo vyavastha thi, usamen bichobich shrimati dastur or sar shriram virajman the
 Right-left, respectively Treasurer, Lala Hanuman Prasad, another Rais of the city and Dr

 Another gentleman next to Vishesvaraprasad whom i did not recognize
 sab baari-bharkam, chust-durust veshbhusha main
 Sir Sriram dressed in the least attuned, simple white muslin shirt and pajamas
 unki lagbhag paardarshee gehuen rang kii twachaa ke peeche ke haad-maance ke dhaanche kaa ba$khubi andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 Mudra very serious, eye-catching, equipped with the ability to palm the front in a single deposit
 baithte hi khoji nazar se ve saamne vaale kaa gauge lete
 He would disclose some of the things filled in the application form and then, if desired, he would take the matter further by asking a single question related to the subject
 masalan ek mahila se unhone kavi surdaas kii ek pankti uddhrut karke kaha ki akbar ke nau ratnon main se saat ne is pankti ke alag-alag arth bataae the, aap kitne bataa sakati hai? zaahir he, uttar denevaale kii citti-pitti gum
 The matter could not progress beyond two, that too by dragging
 aise prashnon se ve vyakti ke gyaan kii nahin, uski hazirajvaabi or aatmavishvaas kii thaah lene kii koshish karte the
 He did not ask me any inconvenient questions, so now i do not even remember
 mujhe itane varshon baad bhi teen samvaad yaad hai
 And among things Dr
 nagendra ne rashtrakavi maithilisharan gupt kii 'yashodhara’ kii prasiddh dwipadi, 'ablaa jivan
 
 
 Talking about the implication of 'I suddenly said that' If i reverse the order, 'there is milk in the eyes and water in the field', then how would you explain it? ' This question was so unexpected and inconvenient that it could be answered thoughtfully, not suddenly
 zaahir he, meri zabaan ladkadaa gai
 i was not satisfied with the vomit-direct explanation i gave myself
 baharhaal, sankatmochak kaa kaam kiya dow
 Vishesvaraprasad
 goki niyat mujhe ubaarane kii nahin or gahare gadde main dhakelne kii thi
 He immediately started questioning me in English about information about my non-hindi, especially English literature
 ve nahin jaanate the ki meri schuli shiksha angrezi madhyam se hui thi isliye mujhe unke sawaal kaa na to angrezi main jawaab dene main dikkat hui, na haal main hi padhe kisi upanyaas kaa ullekh karne main
 i probably named a famous novel by Thomas Hardy, which he probably had not read, so he left the field
 aakhri jigyaasa principal dow
 It was a practice
 ve jaananaa chaahati thim ki apni nrity-shiksha ke balboote par main college kii saanskrithik gatividhiyon kii jimmedaari le sakuungi? maine bade utsaah se hami bhar di
 Obviously, this answer aroused his extra interest in me
 is puri prakriya se guzarakar jab waapas lautnaa hua to is baat kaa koi andaaza nahin tha ki jo jaisaa hua, use 'acha’ yaa 'bura’ kis koti main rakhaa gaya hoga
 It was his first experience in giving interviews
 safalataa kii koi vishesh ummid na hone par bhi nateeja jaanane kii uthkanthaa to bani hi hui thi
 Dr
 sahab se kuch poochne main sadaa kii tarah sankoch aade aata rahaa, par bahut lambaa intajaar nahin karnaa padaa
 On the third day, a brief notice of appointment came in hand - with the order to join at a certain time and place
 dil balliyon uchhalane laga
 It was not far-fetched in Kalpana that such an appointment would be made immediately in the first attempt
 tab tak apni slate bilkul kori thi
 There was no writing on the issue related to appointments, importance of recommendations and their politics of education system
 bas, ham the, haath main niyukti-patr tha or is baat kaa santosh or ullas ki sab kuch itane ayaachit dhang se ghatit ho gaya
 i felt it necessary to express my gratitude to only two people — Dr
 nagendra or dow
 Savitri Sinha
 dow
 Understanding the honor towards Sir and Dr
 sinha ke prati unke man main apane prati snehashiltaa ke kaaran
 Dr
 sahab ne to lagbhag nirpeksh mudra main meraa aabhaar sweekaar karke chalata kiya, par dow
 Sinha's response was very encouraging
 ve bahut prasann thim
 During the conversation with him, it was learned that there were not one, but two appointments in the college
 duusari niyukti santosh kii hui he
 In a very simple way, he also revealed that the appointments have been made in order, satisfying me in the first place, and satisfaction on the second
 zaahir he, is kram se santosh ko niraashaa hui, kyonki pariksha main to pratham sthaan usne hasil kiya tha
 For a few days Santosh had a burden on his mind, which was almost stuck on his face as a layer of disinterest and sadness
 baat jab dow
 When he reached Sinha's ear, he commented in some easygoing mood and said, 'what is the point of believing so bad in this? If i were, i would have taken you in college
 thode nambar zyaada hone se kya hota he!’baad main yah pataa laga ki dow
 Nagendra wanted to get him done in the first place
 unhone kaaphi praytn bhi kiya
 But Lalaji and the principal persevered in my name, then the agreement was reached that at least the college would be ready to take Santosh instead of Kanta Marwah from Ajmer
 is prasang kaa byora jaanate hi mere dimag main dow
 Nagendra's inner confusion settled
 apane mitra kii is anaath-si bahan ke prati unke karunaa-sanwalit sarokaar ko samajha ja saktaa tha jo nibandh ke parche main ank dene se lekar uski niyukti tak baraabar bana rahaa
 His disillusionment came after a long time, when he felt disappointed about his research work
 saabhaar: raajakmal prakaashan Actor Vikrant Massey, who made his debut on the small screen, has now become the star of the big screen
 vikrant maisi actress taapasi pannu ke saath najar aane vaale hai
 The film will be a mystery drama in which Vikrant Massey will be seen opposite Tapasi
 haalanki chote parde se bade parde tak ke safar main vikrant ko kai saalon kaa intjaar bhi karnaa padaa he
 Vikrant Massey's career started with a small screen

 Introducing himself to the crowd gathered for the rally at Bankura Stadium on 23 March, he reminded him that he was the daughter of Suchitra Sen ("contesting my election means contesting my mother's election") and Bharat Dev Verma of Tripura's royal family 'S wife (she said affectionately to her husband on stage, "darling khade ho jao na please

 ) The government does not want to get angry with the industry for stopping use of public participation rather than ban, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched a campaign against single use plastic
 sarkaar ne 2022 tak desh ko single yuj plastic se mukt karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Meanwhile, if we look at the picture of different parts of the country, the road to plastic ban is not easy
 is raah main bhi kai chunautiyaan hai
 The biggest challenge is that on one hand, while the government is talking about making the country free of single-use plastic, on the other hand, the industry does not want to get angry
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar sidhe-sidhe pratibandh lagane jaisaa kadaa kadam uthaane kii bajaay iskaa upyog na karne ke liye janabhagidaari par vishesh dhyaan de rahi he
 It is the effort of the government that instead of taking steps like sanctions, the public should be made aware that they should not use them at all
 isse single yuj plastic swatah band ho jayega
 That is why PM Modi himself is talking about stopping the use of single use plastic from almost every platform
 vahiin chote str par sarkari daftaron, adaalat parisar, sarkari baithkon main single yuj plastic ko pratibandhit karne kaa kadam uthaaya ja rahaa he
 What is the alternative to plastic? Amidst the government's intention, the question has also arisen as to what will be their option in the event of plastic bottles being discontinued
 kai rajyon ne pehle bhi is disha main prayaas kiye hai, lekin nattejey utsahvardhak nahin rahe
 One of the main reasons for this is the continued continuity of packing in plastic pouches by corporates
 kis rajya ne kab kya kiya?centre sarkaar kii muhim se lagbhag do dashak pehle purvottar ke parvatiy rajya sikkim ne san 1998 main hi plastic bain kar diya tha
 The Haryana government also banned single-use plastic in 2013
 punjab sarkaar ne san 2016 main plastic bags ke vitaran or ricycling par pratibandh laga diya tha
 In March this year, single-use plastic was banned in Jammu and Kashmir
 pashchim bengal ke adhiktar dharmik sthalon par bhi single yuj plastic bain he
 States like Telangana, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu also have Singingal use plastic bins
 packing rokna badi chunautisingle yuj plastic mukt bharat kii raah main sabase badi baadha shampoo, tel, doodh aadi rosemara ke jarurat kii chizon kii packing bhi he
 Governments of different states took steps to stop the use of plastics from time to time, but due to this constraint, those steps could not get special benefit
 single yuj plastic mukt bharat kaa nirmaan karnaa he to sarkaar ko kade kadam uthaane honge

 "hindustani told," From Ahmed Patel ji to Amar Singh ji
 '' kulkarni ne tab duusare bhaajapa netaaon jaise adwani, jetali, anant kumaar, shivaraj singh chouhan or sushamaa swaraj se sampark kiya
 And then the idea of conducting a sting operation was formed
 21 july ko jetali ne kulkarni ko bataaya ki sienen-ibn channel sting oparation ke taiyaar ho gaya he
 Three BJP leaders - Ashok Argal, Mahavir Bhagora and Faggan Singh Kulaste - were chosen as fodder
 unke naam pehle hi bik sakane vaale saansadon kii suchi main the
 Hindustani then sent messages that he had three leaders ready to sell
 ve bataate hai ki tab ve hotel clariges main congress ke ek netaa aman aroda ke alaava bootaa singh ke bete lavali se mili
 Drinking vegetable soup, Hindustani told him that he had three "plot" for sale
 '' unka daawa he ki lavali ne turant apana cellphone nikaala or us din (21 july, 2008) shaam 7
 At 30, a meeting was set up at Patel's house
 tab prasannchitt hindustani ne kulkarni ko sachet kar diya
 But the CNN-IBN team could not reach in time for the sting operation
 isliye hindustani ne meeting kaa samay badal diya
 He was asked to meet at Hotel Le Meridien, which is very close to the Parliament
 bhaajapa ke keval do saansad-bhagora or kulaste-hi us meeting main gaye
 Patel was not present at the hotel
 hindustani, jo in saansadon ke saath gaye the, bataate hai ki us samay hotel kii lobby main arunachal pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri gegang apang ke bete, maharashtra congress ke netaa krupa shankar singh or jharkhand ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri madhu kodaa dikhaai de rahe the
 It is perhaps a coincidence that all these leaders were present at a time when there was talk of some mps from Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and an opposition MP from the Northeast
 hindustani ne baad main ke
 C
 dev kii aguai vaali sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ko, jisane maamle kii jaanch kii, bataaya ki vahaan kaa maahaul aisa tha jaisaa katl kii raat kaa hota he
 But CNN-IBN tapes did not have a picture of any of these leaders in the hotel
 us samay is news channel main kaam karne vaale siddharth gautam us din inamen se kisi netaa kii maujuudagi se inkaar karte hai
 After failing in trying to nab Patel, the group gathered again and Kulkarni asked Hindustani to contact Revati Raman Singh
 hindustani ne 4, firozshah road par argal ke nivas par is dal se unhen milwaaya
 When Revati Raman Singh arrived there, cameras were ready for the sting operation
 ve chaahate the ki dal us raat amar singh se mili lekin saansadon ne hichak dikhaai kyonki ve jaanate the ki amar singh ke nivas ke baahar pehle camere lagane honge
 In the CNN-IBN tapes handed over to the JPC, Revathi Raman Singh is listening to mps saying, "I have not talked about the amount
" 
 
 ham sirf aapke saamne rakam ke bare main baat karenge
 
 
 How can i talk mujhe kaise pataa ki aapke paas kya he
 "hindustani remembers with a laugh," He could not understand why we did not want to go to Amar Singh's residence that night
 ve poochhate rahe ki aap log vahaan jane se kyon dar rahe hai
 They will not eat you
 '' majaa to yah ki gautam ne saansadon ko raat main amar singh ke nivas par na jane ke liye yah kah ke aagaah kar diya tha ki vahaan jane par unka apharan bhi ho saktaa he
 The next day, on the morning of the vote of confidence, Hindustani received a call from Revathi Raman Singh, in which he said that the mps should be sent to Amar Singh's house
 hindustani ke saath keval argal or kulaste hi gaye
 The trio arrive at Amar Singh's house in a white Jane car
 us samay unke paas koi gupt camera nahin tha kyonki gautam ko dar tha ki amar unhen pakad lenge
 Therefore, cameras were installed just outside his residence
 sienen-ibn ke tepe dikhaate hai ki jine ghar ke andar ja rahi he or aa rahi he, lekin kaale shishe ke kaaran usamen baithe logon ke chehre nahin najar aa rahe
 This is because when the MP reached Amar Singh's house, he not only saw the cameras of CNN-IBN but also the cameras of other news channels
 unhone turant khidakiyon ke shishe chadha liye
 a CNN-IBN reporter told the JPC that he could not see any of the men in the car except Hindustani
 hindustani yaad karte hai ki amar singh ne badi acchhee tarah khatirdaari kii
 He offered them dry fruits and cold drinks
 hindustani kehete hai, ''ve shahanshahi tareeke se aae
 "this is where the story makes a difference
 hindustani ke mutabik, amar ne turant phone uthaaya or kaha, ''do camel vaale aae hai
 Sitting in front of me
 '' hindustani bataate hai ki ''phone neeche rakhkar unhone hamen bataaya ki unhone manmohan singh ji se baat kar lee he
 "but when India Today asked Argal what Amar Singh had talked to Manmohan Singh, he refused
" unhone bataaya ki amar singh ne patel ko phone kiya or kulaste va argal donon se unki baat karai
 When he was asked about the conversation with Patel, Argal said, "yes-yes-talk, not much
" '' ve sweekaar karte hai ki phone par baat karne vaale shaks patel hi the
 Argal says that Amar Singh gave Rs 3 crore each
 dene kii peshkash kii, haalanki hindustani ne zyada kii maang kii
 Argal remembers, "they told him, you are Thakur
" marwari ke jaise kyon bol rahe ho?'' ve aage bataate hai, ''amar singh ne hamase kaha ki agar aap pichhali raat aae hote to rakam or zyada ho sakati thi, kyonki aaj subah tak unke paas 275 saansad ho chuke hai
 “since the plan was to record by giving money in camera, the mps asked Amar Singh for Rs 1 crore
 kii token raashi argal ke nivas par bhejne ko kaha or baahar intjaar main baithe media kaa bahaanaa banaaya
 Speaking to India Today, Amar Singh denied that any such meeting ever took place
 ve kehete hai, ''aapane tepe dekhe
 In this, the reporter says about me that he is so clever that his sting operation cannot be done
 unki badakismati
 "he further said," The law of justice says that every person is entitled to benefit of doubt in the absence of concrete evidence
 main apane kathor se kathor aalochak or raajnneetik shatru ko bhi vinayapurvak andeh kaa laabh dena chaahunga
 a man named Sanjeev Saxena arrived at Argal's residence with money
 hindustani bataate hai ki ve sanjeev saxena ko amar singh ke nivas par pehle dekh chuke the
 He was accompanied by another man in a yellow shirt, and both brought the money in a cloth bag
 argal kehete hai ki paisa saunpane ke baad saxena ne amar singh se saansadon kii baat karwaai
 Money transactions were captured on camera
 usamen 10-10 lakh ru
 Had 10 pits
 unke serial number darj kar liye gaye
 After this, the mps put those money in two black canvas bags
 argal bataate hai, ''chunki sansad main charchaa thi ki ham us din vot ke liye nahin najar aae hai, isliye media hamaari talash main thi
 We requested two former mps to accompany us and deliver the notes we received inside Parliament
 baad main matdaan ke dauraan teenon loksabhaa main pahunch gaye or kharid-farokht kaa aarope lagaate hue paison ko sabake saamne rakh diya
 There was a lot of uproar but the UPA managed to get a vote of confidence
 upie ke paksh main 275 vot pade,vipaksh main 256
 It is also an irony that the day UPA-1 won the trust vote, the problems of UPA-2 were sown
 kulkarni kehete hai, ''tay kiya gaya ki jab sansad main vishwaas mat par bahes chal rahi hogi, usee samay sienen-ibn sting oparation ko prasaarit karegaa
 But the channel backfired
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa (ishaara jetali kii ore) ne, jinhone sting oparation ke liye channel se baat kii thi, kaha ki channel jab apni baat par kaayam nahin rahaa to unhen laga ki ve sahi chunaav nahin kar paae
 Amar Singh also has a complaint with CNN-IBN
 unhone kaha, ''vahaan bhi paison ke len-dein ke aarope hai
 Sardesai should clear his position
 '' sienen-ibn ke pradhan sampadak rajdeep saradesai ne baad main jepisi ko bataaya ki ''hamane us din yaa us samay tepe isliye nahin chalaaya kyonki hamen laga ki hamen sari jaankaree kii dobaaraa jaanch kerani chahie
 "in this case there has been a flurry of rebuttals
 revati raman singh ne jepisi ko bataaya ki unhen bataaya gaya tha ki argal amar singh se milanaa chaahate the, kyonki parisemen ke kaaran unki seat chale jane ke kaaran ve madhya pradesh ikai ke pramukh ke taur par sapa main shaamil hona chaahate the
 He said, "I spoke to Amar Singh and said that these people want to join the party
" unhone kaha ki unki chhavi acchhee nahin he
 We cannot take them to the party
 '' saxena ne bhi inkaar kiya he ki amar singh ne unhen argal ke nivas par paise le jane ke liye die
 According to him, a man accompanying Suhail gave him a bag, which was sitting in his car on Ashok Road on the way to Argal's house
 grih mantri pi
 During a recent debate, Chidambaram told Parliament that the role of Hindustani in giving money cannot be dismissed
 unhone kaha, ''paison kaa bandobast karne main uski (hindustani) bhoomika sandigdh he
 "saxena denied working for Amar Singh and said he used to work for the then SP MP Shahid Siddiqui (now in the BSP) at 8 South Avenue, where both" Siddiqui and Amar Singh worked Were
 '' amar singh inkaar nahin karte ki ve saxena ko jaanate hai, lekin bataate hai ki ve vetanbhogi karmchaaree nahin the
 "the media has asked us why the JPC did not call Amar Singh or Ahmed Patel for questioning," says Dev
 lekin unke khilaaf koi pratham drushtya saboot nahin hai
 Just because he is named in some conversations
 
 
 unke khilaaf kuch saboot to hone chahie
 There is nothing like this in the tape
 na hi unke chehre hai or na hi unki aawaaj he
 "however, the most powerful rebuttal has come from Manmohan Singh, it is different that after three years

 Mubina Dar said that "lashkar terrorists i will find you one day i will not leave you
" "pati khone ke baad bhi jammu kashmir police ke shahid sab inspector firoz ahamed khan kaa parivaar sadame main he lekin aatankiyon ke khilaaf majboot hokar khadaa he

 pyaar ke shuruaati din bade khushnuma hote hai
 How time goes out together is not known
 par is dauraan agar aapako kuch choti-choti chijen atpati lag rahi hai, to unhen Ignore naa karen
 Because the things that we find small and non-important in the initial stages, they actually become big problems later on
 kisi relationships kii shuruyaat main hi agar ye paanch chijen dikhen, to behatar he ki aap use vahiin roak den
 You did not mix your friends with your special friends and your roommates as soon as you came into the relationship
 par jab baat uske doston se milane kii aati he, to vah hameshaa mukar jaataa he yaa koi na koi bahaanaa bana detaa he
 Especially when it comes to going somewhere with his friends, he is never ready
 uskaa ye ravaiya, yah sabit karata he ki vah aapke saath relationships main bahut dinon tak nahin rahane vaala
 Maybe his friends may not even know about you
 jo bhi ho, aap is cheez ko jitani jaldi clear karen, utana acha hoga
 When Ignore partners, try something similar: Mobile Chicks Most boys are tech friendly and tech lovers
 par aapkaa bwoyfriend agar Date par bhi apane mobile se dur nahin rah paata or us par lagaataar text yaa chat karata he, to ye aapke liye alarming sin he
 He is trying to show that there is no cost to your time
 ho saktaa he ki uski life main koi or bhi ho
 It is understandable that who can be the second person in his life who needs to be repaired immediately
 respect na karankuch ladke ye bataa kar bade khush hote hai ki unhone ab tak kitni ladakiyon ko dil todaa he yaa kitnon ke saath date kar chuke hai
 If your boyfriend does the same, then be careful
 kyonki aise log ladakiyon kii izzat nahin karte or ho saktaa he is kisse main aglaa naam aapkaa bhi shaamil ho jaae
 Such people do not play long
 bole chaahe na bole par zyaadaatar ladakiyon ke man main chalati hai ye 10 batenfaisle na le paaekai paristhitiyon main faisle lenaa mushkil hota he
 But it is not a good sign if your boyfriend is dependent on his mother, his friends or you even for small decisions
 aise log dusron kii salaah par aapako bhi chhod sakate hai
 Such people lack maturity
 chamchamaate daant bataate hai aapaki sex life ke raaj
 
 
 More than praise, it is said that girls like their praise
 par ladkaa ho yaa ladki apni tarif kise acchhee nahin lagati
 It is difficult when you want to be in a long relationship with someone and he only repeatedly tells you your shortcomings
 kisi ke bhi vyaktitv ke achche or bure pahalu hote hai, aapke bwoyfriend ko agar aap main sirf buraaiyaan dikh rahi hai to ye samaj len ki yah rishta zyada dinon tak chalane vaala nahin he

 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar nahin, to hamen saavdhaan rahanaa chahie

 Fans will be keen to see Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor in the trailer of this film more than Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline, Tapsee but fans may be disappointed here
 kyonki judwa 2 main salmaan kii koi bhi jhalki nahin dikhaai gai he
 Well, talking about the trailer, Varun Dhawan looks amazing in the comedy avatar in the film
 lekin salmaan kii judwa film vaale flavor ko ek phir taaja karne main varun asafal rahe hai

 After which it was decided that the whole family would worship at Arpita's house on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi
 bataa den, gallexi apartment main arpita ne hi ganpati puja kii shuruyaat kii thi, jiske baad har saal salmaan ke ghar dhoomdhaam se ganesh chaturthi manaai jane lagi

 ) If a city has received the most progress in NCR with the help of real estate, then it is Gurgaon
 yahaan par logon ne rahane ke liye ghar kharide, lekin ab unheen gharon kii badaulat gudgaanv ke log karodpati ban chuke hai
 The pace of the city's real estate planning could not match, and the house of the people has been transformed into a house of crores

 On one side are skyscrapers and corporate offices
 yahaan maujuud he shaano-shaukat chamak-damak to duusari ore shahar ke har bade adhikari kaa daftar auki nivas he
 There is a district hospital, a municipal office, but the system is bad
 nae gudgaanv main metro kaaphi pehle pahunch gai he
 There are plans to expand it further
 mono rail banane kii joardaar taiyaariyaan chal rahi hai
 In old Gurgaon, people have come to the bus stand
 nae gudgaanv ke log shopping ke liye mal main jate hai auki puraane gudgaanv ke nivasee kharidari ke liye local bazaaron kaa rukh karte hai
 The problems of people of New Gurgaon and old Gurgaon are also different
 gudgaanv ko milinium city kaa darja diya jaataa he, kyonki ye shahar airport ke nazadik he
 Real estate has grown strongly here
 yahaan par desh-videsh kii nami-giraami companiyon ke aaleeshaan daftar hai
 This is why people bought homes here
 un gharon main rahane waalon ko sukun mili yaa nahin, lekin lakhon main kharide ghar karodon main pahunch gaye hai
 The growth of real estate has made people's homes an investment option
 agar ye vaaki ghar hote to yahaan ke logon se baat karte hi milinium city kii suvidhaon kii pole naa khulti
 According to people, it is not a Millennium City, it is a million problem city
 shahar kii sabase badi samasya trephic he
 Whether the residents of the new Gurgaon or the people of the old Gurgaon, everyone is troubled by the worsening traffic conditions
 aakhir shahar ke is bure halaat ke liye jimmedaar koun he? kyon enech 8 par bane ye fliover mahaj 5 saal main hi rojaanaa is tarah kaa bhayankar jam jhelte hai
 If there is a long wait on the red light under the flyover, then the pride of being an expressway breaks the jam on the flyover
 darasal, kasoor planning kaa he
 According to Haryana Chief Secretary Industrial Planning Yashveer Malik, the city will not get rid of problems until the planning vision is 100 years old
 gudgaanv main karodon ke ghar banaakar bechney vaale bilders 100 saal kii planning se ittfa to rakhte hai lekin saath hi ye bhi kehete hai ki zarooraton ke mutabik planning main badlaav hote rahete hai or isi vajah se master plan kaa dayera 10 se 20 saal kaa hi hota he
 The government also has thinking about planning
 planning ko shahar se lekar gharon tak lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Despite this vision, one can feel sorry for seeing this condition of Gurgaon
 shahar ke nivasee tak sawaal khadey karte hai milinium city kii planning par
 Where the talk was started, then it comes to that why the streets here are jammed? Why has it become the biggest pain of the people of the city? Call centers in the city and cabs of all types of IT companies are a big reason for the jam
 avaidh kamai ke chakkar main ye savaariyon ko bithaati hai
 For the riders, they stop the vehicle wherever they are on the road and then they get jammed at the back
 logon ko bhi kam kiraye main aaramdaayak safar or vakt bachaane ke lihaaj se ye sabase behtareen vikalp nazar aata he
 If the condition of public transport in the city improves, then people will also stay away from these cabs
 gudgaanv ke logon kii ye shikaayat bhi he ki yahaan par public transport behad kharaab haalat main he
 People sharing in crispy public transport are these sharing autos, but their way from standing to walking is such that they are a big reason for jamming the roads
 yahaan kii khastahal sadaken auki unamem roj roj hone vaale experement bhi jam kii badi vajah hai
 Buses unloading the riders stopping in the middle, standing at the bottom of the metro stations, do nothing but increase the trouble of jam
