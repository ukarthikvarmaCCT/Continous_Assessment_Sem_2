 gujarat congress ke ek netaa ne apane bayaan se vivaad paidaa kar diya he ki patidaar aarakshan andolan kaa netritv kar rahe hardik patel main ‘sardaar patel jaisaa diene he’
 The BJP condemned the statement, saying that the comparison was an insult to the first Deputy Prime Minister of independent India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, also known as 'iron Man'

 Senior Gujarat Congress leader Shakti Singh Gohil on Monday said that Hardik's right attitude in facing the ruling BJP in the state shows that he has 'the DNA of Sardar Patel' which could not be broken or suppressed by the British
 soshal media par patidaar netaa kaa sex clip aane ke baad unhone kaha tha, ‘hardik patel apane samudaay ke khilaaf anyaay kii ladaai lard rahe hai jise bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke karodon rupee se bhi nahin kharida ja sakaa or maheenon jail main band rakhe jane ke baavjood use nahin todaa ja sakaa’
 Gohil had said, 'they have the DNA of Sardar Patel which could not be bought or broken by the British
 isi tarah bijepi hardik ko na to kharid sakati he na hi daraa sakati he’
 BJP leader Mansukh Mandavia said on Gohil's statement that Hardik's comparison with Sardar Patel is an insult to the Iron Man, Gujarat and the country
 bijepi netaa mandavia ke mutabik ‘yah kahana ki ek vyakti jo is tarah kesharmnaak harakat(sex clip) main pakadaa gaya he, usamen sardaar patel kaa diene he, to yah unka apmaan he
 There is a tradition of insulting Sardar Patel in the Congress and it is an insult to the country as well as Gujarat '
 sardaar patel ke praputra samir patel ne bhi gohil kii tippanee ko khaarij kiya he
 Sameer Patel said that 'it is nonsense to say that Hardik Patel has the DNA of Sardar Patel because Sardar Patel worked to connect the country while Hardik is dividing the country'

 You can check in the My Idea app to check whether you are eligible for this offer

 But Dhoni still considers Yuvraj Singh a better option for T20 cricket, that is, it is still possible for Yuvi to return to T20 cricket

 vadodara loksabhaa seat ke liye buudhvaar ko apane namakan patr ke saath daakhil kiye gaye halafname main modi ne pehali baar khud ke shaadishuda hone kii baat kahi he
 Modi used to leave the column giving information about his wife empty
 haalanki, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi ne apni patni ke naam se sampatti kii ghoshnaa kiye jane vaale kollam main likhaa tha ki unhen is bare main koi jaankaree nahin hai
 The Vadodara District Election Officer placed the affidavit on the display board of the collectorate at night
 gauratlab he ki congress ne kaha tha ki modi ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye apana namakan patr daakhil karte vakt apni vaivaahik sthiti par ruukh saaf karnaa chahie
 a day before the budget session began, the BJP warned that it was not possible to carry out the proceedings of Parliament until Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde apologized for withdrawing his charge of running a 'hindu terrorist' camp on the BJP
 sansad satr shuru hone se pehle loksabhaa adhyaksh dwaara bulaai jane vaali paaramparik sarvadaleey baithak ke baad sushamaa ne kaha, ‘ham sansad kii kaarywahi sucharu rup se chalaane ke paksh main hai
 But for the House to run well, the prerequisite for this is that the allegations that Shinde has accused us should first be resolved
 ’vipaksh kii netaa ke anusaar unhone mira kumaar se kaha ki scindia grih mantri hone ke saath loksabhaa main sadan ke netaa bhi hai
 Sushma Swaraj said, 'I told the Lok Sabha Speaker that Shinde has alleged that BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh run Hindu and saffron terrorist training camps
 agar aisa he to mukhya vipakshi dal bijepi ke sadsy ke rup main meraa vipaksh kaa netaa rahanaa or bijepi sadasyon kaa sadan main aana uchit nahin rahegaa
 Therefore, in order to run the house smoothly, this thing should be resolved first
 ’unhone kaha, 'agar ham aatanki shivi chalaate hai to hamaare saath aatankiyon kaa vyavhaar kiya jaae
 In such a situation, how can we be members of Parliament? On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath hoped that the Shinde case would be resolved today or tomorrow through discussion
 kamalnath ne kaha, ‘sansadeey raajnneeti main har vishay par sab dalon ke bich ‘sarvasahmati’ sambhav nahin hoti, lekin motaa-moti sahmati banane kaa prayaas hoga
 Sushma said that the main opposition party will raise several issues during the budget session, including the case of alleged brokerage in the VVIP chopper deal
 bhaajapa kii ore se uthaae jane vaale anya vishyon main maharashtra main sookhe kii sthiti, madhyapradesh main vinaashkari olavrishti, dijal or petrol ke bade daam, pakistan ke phogiyon dwaara bharat ke ek sainik kii hatya kar uskaa shav kshat vikshat kiya janaa, bharat-paak vaarta, maldive kii sthiti or china dwaara bharat ko chaaron ore se gherne kii ranneeti aadi shaamil hai
 On the government's offer to conduct a probe with the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in the Helicopter deal scam, he said that BJP will discuss about it with NDA partners and other parties
 yah puche jane par ki kya bijepi bajet ko sucharu rup se paarit hone degi, vipaksh kii netaa ne kaha ki 21 taarikh ko donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan ke baad 22 farvari tak agar scindia apana bayaan waapas lekar maafee maang lete hai to samasya kaa niraakaran ho jayega

 uske baad abhinetri saloni chopra, rashel white, simran suri ne bhi diarector par sexual herracement ke aarope lagaae
 Saloni had said- i want Sajid to apologize to the women with whom he has done wrong
 maafee iskaa jawaab nahin he, na ki antim samaadhaan he, lekin yah apni galati maanane kaa pehla kadam he
 Such ignorance is an insult to all those involved
 in aaropon par gambhirtha se vichaar karte hue IFTDA ne sajid ko ek saal ke nilambit kar diya tha
 After accusing his brother Sajid, Farah Khan tweeted, "this is a hurting time for my family
" hamen bahut mushkil muddon par kaam karne kii jarurat he
 If my brother has behaved like this, then he will have to bear the brunt of it
 main kisi bhi tarah se is bartaav kaa samarthan nahin karti hum or aahat mahilaon kii ekajutata main unke saath hum
 " dilli sarkaar ne apane bajet main sarkari skulon ko privet skulon ke str par laane ke liye sarkari skulon main bhi nursery or keji class shuru karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The government argues that while admission in government schools is available in the first grade, while private schools start teaching children in nursery and KG at an early age, the same system becomes a major reason for the government school children to fall behind
 dilli sarkaar kaa bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki sarkari skulon main sudhaar kaa jo abhiyaan dilli sarkaar ne shuru kiya he, nursery claces shuru karnaa bhi usee kii ek kadi he
 So that children can be admitted to the government school at an early age
 si sodiya ke mutabik sarkari skool main pehali class main daakhile ke vakt bachche kii umr paanch saal ke kareeb hoti he, jabaki privet skool main isi umr kaa baccha ek yaa do class pard chukaa hota he
 Therefore, in the beginning, nursery classes will be started in about 156 schools and accordingly facilities will be provided in those schools
 yahi nahin skulon main librori bhi banaayi jaaengi
 Not only this, such books will be kept in the library for classes beyond fifth, in which interesting stories and children's books will be kept
 vitt mantri manish sisodiya ne elaan kiya ki paanch skool aaf excilence bhi dilli bhar main khele jaaenge, jo english medium honge
 These schools will be brought to the level of private schools
 skool bason main GPS or CCTV jaruri, CBSE ne jari kin guidelinsdelli sarkaar apane skulon main padhaane vaale shikshakon ko tablet degi, vitt mantri ke mutabik tablet milane se shikshak apane chaatro kii puri jaankaree usamen rakh paaenge, isse padhai kaa str badhaane main madad milegi
 According to Sisodia, 24 new schools are coming up this year, 8 thousand new rooms are ready, which is equivalent to 200 new schools, 10 thousand more new rooms will be built by next year
 unifarm par bhi sabsidi dene kaa elaan bhi kiya gaya
 According to the Finance Minister, the focus will be on quality education in the next year
 yahi nahin bajet main ek bada faisla lete hue mid de mile main dilli sarkaar ne ek kelaa or ublaa hua anda bhi jodne kaa elaan kiya he, taaki bacchon ko clality food or zaruri poshan mil sake
 Not only this, it has also been decided to open Punjabi and Urdu clubs in every school, so that children are not only familiar with the language, but can also learn about the culture
 haalanki vipaksh ne na sirf sarkaar ke daavon ko jhuthlaayaa balki vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar ne koi nayaa skool nahin banaaya
 According to Gupta, the government did not do any work to improve education, but the work already done has come to a standstill
 baat lagbhag teen saal pehle kii he
 There was a chance for the release of the film 'housefull', and during that i had an interview with Nafisa aka Jia Khan
 baatcheet main ve josh or ullas se puri tarah labarej thim
 During that time everything was going well
 'housephul' main akshay kumaar or badi starcast kaa hissaa banane par unki khushi saatven aasmaan par thi
 He said with great enthusiasm, "people in the industry have a long time to go but they don't get a chance to work with Big B, Aamir and Akshay
 main khushkismat hum
 Amitabh's heroine at the age of '18, the opportunity that many heroines have not been able to achieve in the industry has been achieved by Jia Khan at the beginning of his career
 unhone apni pehali film 18 saal kii umr main hindi sine jagat ke sabase bade sitare amitabh bachchan ke saath nishabd (2007) kii
 In the film, she is an aging person, and she played this role in a really good way
 unki adaaon ne achche-acchon ko aahen bharne par majaboor kar diya
 His second film was Ghajini (2008)
 isamen vah aamir khan ke saath thim
 She became a medical student in the film and her role was well appreciated
 vaaki unke jivan kaa yah doosraa ahm padaav tha kyonki pehali film main ve big bi ke saath thim, to duusari film main bollywood ke mistar parfectionist ke saath
 One year filled some ups and downs
 2010 main bade maukey ne us samay dastak di jab unhen sajid khan kii multistarar housephul kaa hissaa banane kaa mauka mila
 She had a role opposite Akshay Kumar in the film
 naam bhi badla, par kuch na huajia kii yah khushi lambey samay tak nahin chal saki
 He did not get any films after Housefull
 kai projects kii baat saamne ain lekin parde par kuch najar nahin aayaa
 After this, he changed his name to Nafisa Khan in 2012
 iske baad ek baar phir se kai production houseej ke saath unke contract kii baaten huin
 He repeated the same things in the interview, but all was cipher
 mahesh bhatta kii film chodijia kaa debyue bhale hi ramgopal verma kii film se hua ho, magar unhen pehla ofer mahesh bhatta kii taraf se tha
 Jiya Faqat was 16 when Mahesh Bhatt, the god of musical romance, offered her the film 'tum Sa Nahi Dekha'

 Amidst the heavy pressure that the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks had to face in the grip of law, Pakistan has said that if India had exchanged information about some suspects in time, the attack in November last year would have been averted
 Could pakistan ne yah bhi kaha he ki vah bharat dwaara muhaiyaa karaaye gayi taaja sabooton par gaur karegaa
 Based on these evidences, Interpol has issued a red corner notice against Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the head of Jamaat-ud Dawa
 said par 26 / 11 hamalon kii yojana banane or use anjaam dene kaa aarope he
 Addressing a press conference in London on Thursday, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik, referring to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's recent statement, claimed that India could have averted the Mumbai attacks
 singh ne kaha tha ki is baat kii bharosmand soochna he ki paak sthit aatanki samooh bharat par taaje hamale kar sakate hai
 He said, "please inform us
 ham suchanaaen chaahate hai kyonki ham maamle kii gaharaai main janaa chaahate hai
 Malik pointed out that India had arrested many suspects long before the Mumbai attacks
 unhone daawa ki yadi islamabad ko samay rahete is sambandh main suchanaaen mil jaati to yah ghatana nahin hoti
 Malik claimed that Pakistan has fully supported the neighboring country on the basis of information provided by India on the issue of Hafiz Saeed
 said ke liye jari kiye gayi interpol notice ke bare main puche gayi sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, ‘‘ham is par gaur karenge
 He said that some procedures have to be followed to take action on it
 bharat dwaara saunpe gayi taaja dosier kaa zikr karte hue malik ne kaha ki pakistan ko is baat kii jaanch kerani padegi ki kya yah prakriyaagat jaruraton ko puraa karata he
 We need solid evidence that can pass the court examination

 It is believed that if you have more money in your purse then you spend more
 lekin ek nai research ne mahilaon ke sambandh main ek bilkul alag tathy pesh kiya he
 According to research, the larger the bra size of women, the more wasteful they are
 research main ye baat nikalakar ai he ki jin mahilaon kaa bra kaa cap sies ‘bi’ yaa isse kam hota he wo pai-pai bachaati hai
 According to the famous e-commerce group Alibaba, more affluent women spend money on luxury items
 research ke anusaar ‘bi’ sies bra vaali sirf 7 fisadi mahilaayein mahangi chizon par paise kharch karti hai, jabaki ‘si’ sies vaali 17, ‘di’ sies vaali 24 or ‘i’ sies bra pahanane vaali 33 fisadi mahilaayein mahangi chizon par jamkar paisa kharch karti hai
 This research by Alibaba found that 65 percent of women wearing b size bras spend money on cheaper things
 jabaki si sies vaali mahilaayein bi sies waalon ke mukaable zyada mahangi chizon par paise kharch karti hai
 There is another reason behind this
 kaha gaya he ki ho saktaa he yuva mahilaayein, jinke paas kharch karne ke liye kam paise hote hai ve choti bra kharidti hai

 Addressing party workers late on Thursday evening, Gadkari said that the attacks on the people of Northeast in some cities are not a struggle with the people of India, but it is a conspiracy of people living illegally in the country
 unhone kaha ki yah hindu-muslim kaa mudda nahin he, balki gaiyr-kanoonee dhang se rah rahe apravasiyon tathaa bahari khatre se sambandhit mudda he
 It is shameful that Indians were forced to leave their places of residence and live under the shadow of fear of anti-national elements

 Hate story 4 trailor ko ek din main mili 1 karod se zyada vyuj Tension is increasing in Kerala over the Sabarimala temple
 bhoomata brigade kii sansthaapak tripti desai ne guuruuvaar raat mandir main entry karne kaa elaan kiya he jabaki ayappa dharm sena ke rahul ishwar ne tripti desai ko dekh lene kii dhamkee dete hue kaha he ki ham jameen par let jaaenge
 We will protest and at any cost prevent them from worshiping in the temple
 isse takaraav badhane kii ashanka bad gai he
 Following the threats on social media, Trupti Desai has written to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan demanding protection for visiting Lord Ayyappa's temple in Sabarimala
 tripti ne isse pehle bataaya tha ki supreme court se ijaajat milane ke baad vah 16 se 20 november ke bich sabarimala ke mandir main jane kii koshish karengi
 Now, the Bhumata Brigade has written to Vijayan demanding protection during the darshan on 17 November
 unhone bataaya tha ki rajya main enter karne se lekar waapas aane tak unhen suraksha chahie hogi
 He has received threats to 'suffer bad consequences' when he comes to Kerala
 kai logon ne khudakushi kii dhamkee bhi di he
 He had said that many women tried to go before him, but due to lack of police protection and support, he failed
 isliye, mandir kii seedhia bina pareshaani ke chadhane ke liye unhone sarkaar se suraksha maangi he
 Last month, the Supreme Court allowed women between the ages of 10 and 50 to enter the Sabarimala temple, but no women were able to enter the temple due to the protests by devotees after the temple opened
 tripti desai ne kaha ki hamen pehle hi dhamkiyaan mil chuki hai
 Some people have threatened that if i enter Kerala, it will have serious consequences
 kai logon ne dhamkee di he ki yah ham mandir kii seedhiyaan chadhe to ve aatmahatya kar lenge
 Will look at Tripti Desai - Rahul Ishwarwah, on the announcement of Trupti Desai, Rahul Ishwar said that even though she is known for her activism, but we are also devoted devotees of Lord Ayyappa
 ham sadak par let jaaenge
 They (trupti Desai) have to pass through our chest
 yah sanvaidhanik rup se virodh kaa pavitra tarika he
 See how she enters the temple
 bataa den ki tripti desai shanidhaam shinganapur mandir, haji ali dargah, mahalakshmi mandir or tryambakeshwar shiv mandir sahit kai dharmik jagahon par mahilaon ko pravesh kii anumati dilaane ke abhiyaan kii aguwai karti rahi hai
 All-party meeting was not held on Thursday, the all-party meeting called for the entry of women of all ages into the temple was inconclusive
 congress or bijepi ne sarkaar se kaha ki vah supreme court se apane faisle ko lagu karne ke liye or vakt maange
 Both parties walked out of the meeting
 vahiin kerala sarkaar supreme court ke aadesh kaa paalan karaane par adig he
 Kerala Chief Minister P
 vijayan ne mahilaon ke pravesh ke liye kuch niyam banane ke sanket die hai
 The opposition Congress, BJP, RSS and right-wing organizations are against the decision of the CPI-M led Kerala government to implement the Supreme Court's decision to remove centuries-old ban on entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple
 Many have performed

 Only 5 out of 10 aircraft could fly to their destination
 hansmukh patel, 63 varshabanaaskantha (gujarat) jile ke janajati bahul amirgarh or daanta tehsil ke 150 gaanvon ke zyaadaatar gaanvon ne amiri kii jhalak tak nahin dekhi thi
 The grains he produced in his 2-3 acres of small stony fields — only wheat or millet — would cost just Rs 10,000-15,000 a year
 kii hi kamai ho paati thi
 Many families had left the village due to poverty, while some families were caught in the clutches of usurers
 in kathinaaiyon se chhutkaare kaa vakt tab aayaa jab hansmukh patel unke liye sankatmochan banakar vahaan aae
 Patel, his close aide Anand Chaudhary and his team associated with the Samvedna Trust worked hard for the upliftment of this community
 unhone laghu sinchai se lekar swasthya, shiksha, bal vikaas or sangrakshan tak unki jindagi ke har pahalu main sukhad badlaav laa diya he
 There, now the income of every family is Rs 50,000 annually
 se 2 lakh ru
 Has happened till 2002 main kshetra main 100 chote baandh banane ke liye patel ke trust ko videshi anudaan mila tha
 But due to the rocky terrain, the water was not able to go down
 patel ne dynamite se bhumigat chattaanon ko udwa diya
 Some of the water from the dams flowed from underground channels into the wells
 par yah ab bhi paryaapt nahin tha
 Patel then thought of micro irrigation
 2004 tak tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi micro sinchai kii mahatvakankshi yojana shuru kar chuke the
 Patel established the GGRC or Gujarat Green Revolution Company to connect the local tribals
 jal str bahut neeche hone se kisaanon ko drip sinchai main bahut kathinaayee ho rahi thi
 For this, they had to hire PVC pipes from private traders
 patel or unki team kai kisaanon ko byajmukt karj de rahi thi jo jijiarsi ke aane tak unke mutabik kareeb 16 lakh ru
 Was
 rajya micro sinchai yojana ke tahat sarkaar 10 saal tak chalane vaali pivisi pipon par 75 fisadi sabsidi detii thi
 But the farmers were not even in a position to pay the remaining 25 per cent
 tab patel ne jalgaanv kii jain sinchai company kii madad lee jisane micro sinchai upkaran banaaya, or donon baaki kii 25 fisadi sabsidi main 14 fisadi raashi khud vahan karne lage
 When farmers had to pay only 11 per cent for micro irrigation, their life became easier

 par, main cinema kaa student rahaa hum
 During the mass communication from Symbiosis College in Pune, there were many FTII professors who taught us about films and explained the nuances
 filmon ko dekhne kaa najariya bhi badal gaya
 Perhaps this is why Hindi films are getting soft and love for cinema is also becoming less
 par 'pike' film ke bare main itani charchaa hui to rahaa na gaya
 When many of my senior correspondents read the ballads in praise of the film, the curiosity grew more
 film dekhi to bahut kanphujia gaya (aamir kii bhashaa main)
 Talking only in terms of cinema, there was nothing in the film that impressed me
 behad ausat film, behad ausat acting or behad ausat script or screen-play
 i wonder if Alien Aamir's locket steals an Indian in the first scene of the film
 to kya bharat kii yah chhavi he ki aap aaiye or pehle aapako yahaan chor hi milenge? wo bhi tab jab aamir atuly bharat ke brand ambaseder hai! khayr, diarector kii kahani he, vah jo chaahe wo kare
 But, there is no such scene in the entire film, no such dialogue nor any such idea, which makes you think
 vahiin pakistan ke khilaaf pehle nafrat phir pyaar
 The story of the same babas, who have started showing better news channels today, and the same informative things of Aamir, which are so many that the series 'satyamev Jayate' had to be started separately
 meraa puraa jivan khel main beetaa he isliye shaayad filmon ko dekhne kaa meraa ek alag najariya ho saktaa he
 The things that bother people, may not bother me, but to be honest, PK is a very mediocre film, which if it had come without big banners and big stars, no one would have remembered it, but this Aamir Khan The PR of the country is that big journalists of the country are being given star to star
 film kaa ek hi seen mujhe pasand aayaa

 - He started his career in 1835 as a trainee in a US textile company
 - saal 1846 main unhen silaai maseen se lockstich dizin ke liye pehle america patent puraskaar se nawaja gaya tha
 - No one in America agreed to buy this machine

 Last week, America's iconic magazine Time featured a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on its cover page
 bhagava shed kii is photo ke saath hedline di gai-'indiaj divyder in chif
 'there, in many countries of the world, including America, this magazine was printed and it started a ruckus in India
 ek saath kai muddon par vivaad hue
 The first is that the article related to Narendra Modi is biased
 doosraa ye ki time patrika par agenda failaane kaa aarope madha gaya
 The third and final point is that the author of the article Atish Taseer emerged as the protagonist of the controversy because he is a Pakistani of British origin
 haalanki in sabake bich jo log 'pakshpaati, agenda se bhare' time patrika ke khilaaf rosh jaahir kar rahe the, ve log is artical kaa marm samajhane main chook gaye
 People from other factions were also involved in this lapse, who were celebrating the 'expose' of Narendra Modi
 time main chape lekh kii khaas baat yah he ki isamen narendra modi par agar ungali uthaai gai he to rahul gandhi ko bhi nishane par liya gaya he
 As the question of Atish Taseer was raised, "will the world's largest democracy withstand the next five years of the Modi government?" The bottom line of the article clearly shows that it has strongly criticized Narendra Modi for turning 'india into a despicable religious nationalism'
 haalanki taasir kaa lekh congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bhi bakhshata nahin dikhaai detaa or unka varnan narendra modi se kahin zyada tiraskaar ke saath kiya gaya he
 For example, consider this line - 'untouchable mediarecity'
 ye vaakya rahul gandhi ke liye likhe gaye hai jiskaa arth he 'saadhaaran darje kaa aisa vyakti jise samajhaayaa, sikhaaya nahin ja saktaa
 Even more important was written in the article that Rahul Gandhi and his party Congress cannot be synonymous with Narendra Modi and BJP government
 aatish taasir ne likhaa ki 'congress party ke paas vanshavaadi vichaardhaara se itar dene ke liye kuch or nahin he
 Therefore, there is a severe lack of political understanding in the Congress, when Rahul Gandhi's sister Priyanka Gandhi was introduced into politics
 ''saamanti bharat'time kaa lekh narendra modi ke saath shuru hota he jisamen likhaa gaya he ki bharat un mahaan loktantric deshon main shaamil he jo 'loklubhaavanavaad kaa shikaar' ho gaya
 The rise of Narendra Modi was indicative of this populism, which resulted in a strong feeling of 'voice of the majority' which was difficult to ignore
 ' jaisaa ki taasir likhte hai, is loklubhaavanavaad ne aaazaad bharat ke shuruaati dashakon main 'saamanti vanshavaad' kaa aagaaj kar diya
 The question is who was responsible for this feudal dynasty? It is obvious that 'nehru's political heir' was the root cause behind it
 dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki time patrika ne nehru-gandhi parivaar par vaise hi aarope lagaae hai jaise aarope narendra modi un par lagaate rahe hai
 The article wrote that 'india had become an English and fearful nation under Congress rule
 hindustan ke bare main aisa najariya bana ki angreji bolne vaala hinduon kaa ek kuleen varg yahaan raaj karata he, jisaki chrishchiyan or islam jaise alpsankhyak varg se mileebhagat he
 The article in Time describes Narendra Modi's five-year rule after talking of power in the early years of 'divider in chief' Congress and the early years of independent India
 lekh main 'ghrinaaspad majahabi rashtrawaad ke maahaul' kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 Atish Taseer has surrounded Narendra Modi on many fronts
 sarkaar par aarope lagaae gaye ki iskaa khuleam samarthan ek aise 'mob (logon ke samooh) ko lekar he jo pichley 5 saal main muslimon ko nishaanaa banaata aayaa he
 On the issue of women, this government was described as 'spotty'
 saath hi shaikshanik sansthaaon par hamale is tark ke saath karaae gaye ki purv main isane hindustani samskruti or dharm ko nicha dikhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 The question arises in the minds of the readers of the article that if Narendra Modi does not come in the government then who will be next
 iske jawaab main aatish taasir rahul gandhi or congress party ko is seen se baahar hua bataate hai
 Taseer further writes, 'the next member of the nehru-gandhi family has nothing but to throw dynastic ideology
 hindustan kii sabase puraani party ke paas priyanka gandhi ko raajnneeti main utaarne se zyada or kuch raajnneetik sujh-boojh nahin he
 However, Taseer also writes that this election is a defeat of Modi
 taasir ne aage likhaa, 'modi kaa saubhaahgya he ki unhen aisa kamjor vipaksh mila he, congress kii aguai main nimnavargeey partiyon kaa aisa gathbandhan he jinke paas modi ko haraane ke alaava doosraa koi agenda nahin bachataa
 These are the things which appeared in the article of Time, which left people deprived and got entangled in the picture printed on the cover page
 jabaki isi patrika main ek lekh aisa bhi chapa jiskaa sheershak 'modi da riformar (sudhaarak modi) diya gaya or likhaa gaya ki narendra modi hi hindustan main aarthik sudhaar kii sabase badi aashaa hai
 'we are living in a time where it should not be surprising that people tweet their likes and dislikes without reading the article
 jaisaa ki is baar kaa chunaav prachaar gavaah he-bhaashan to bahut he lekin mritpraaya he

 Australian coach Justin Langer surprised Perth's pitch at the icc's 'average' rating, saying Test cricket would be 'boring' if there was no balance between the ball and the bat

 Some balls were low, but i think it was exciting Test cricket
 yah perth kii sabase tej pich thi jo maine dekhi or main lambey samay se ise dekh rahaa hum
 Australia won the second Test in Perth to equal the four-match series 1-1
 tisare test ke sthal melbern cricket ground kii pich ke bare main langer ne kaha, ‘pich par kuch ghaas dekhakar acha lag rahaa he
 i have always said that the most important thing in Test cricket is the pitch
 agar aapke paas shandaar pich hogi to gend or balle ke bich muqabla hoga or phir test cricket jeevant rahegaa or acha karegaa
 'he said,' If we play on flat pitches, then it will be a boring match
 ummid karte hai ki gend or balle ke bich muqabla hoga kyonki yah mahatvapurn he, is siries ke liye hi nahin balki vishwa cricket ke liye bhi
 The Australian team may give all-rounder Mitchell Marsh a chance in the squad in place of Peter Handscomb, who is battling poor form in the third Test

 Sonia also alleged that the government had promised transparency, but is now weakening RTI
 sonia gandhi ne kaha, 'ab logon ko apni sarkaar par sawaal uthaane kaa haq nahin rah gaya he
 Delay in information is not actually giving information
 ye manzur nahin kiya ja saktaa

 The government has almost taken the decision to reduce the subsidy on LPG cylinders and after its implementation there is a plan to limit the number of low subsidized domestic gas cylinders to those in good condition
 petroleum evam prakritik gas rajyamantri aar pi en singh ne kaha ki sarkaar un logon ke liye silendaron kii sankhya simit karne kaa faisle ke kareeb he jo ‘aarthik rup se kamjor’ varg main nahin aate
 This is expected to reduce annual subsidy spending by Rs 10,000 crore
 iske saath hi sarkaar dijal kii keemton ko aanshik rup se niyantran mukt bhi karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The minister said that the government gives Rs 36,000 crore in subsidy on LPG and many people who do not belong to the economically weaker section and do not need it, take advantage of it
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar sabsidi main katautee gas silendaron kii seemaa tay kar karegi
 Under this, the number of subsidized cylinders will be decided
 singh ne kaha ki sarkaar alpiji sabsidi main katautee ke faisle ke kareeb he
 'if we set the limit for some cylinders, it will not violate the rights of poor people who get subsidies
 mujhe lagata he ki amiron ke liye silendaron kii seemaa tay kar ham sabsidi par 8,000 se 10,000 karod rupee bachaa sakenge
 However, he said the issue of hike in diesel prices is sensitive
 ‘yadi aap dijal ke daam badhaane kaa prayaas karte hai, to iskaa arthvyavastha par vipareet asar hoga
 We are trying to find a solution that minimizes its impact on the economy, as well as a reduction in the fiscal deficit
 ’mantri ne isse pehle ucch praudyogiki centre tathaa hindustan petroleum karporation dwaara sanyukt rup se yojit 17veen rifinary praudyogiki baithak kaa udghaatan kiya
 He ruled out the possibility of complete deregulation of diesel prices
 aar pi en singh ne kaha ki hamaare liye is samay dijal keemton ko purna niyantranmukt karnaa sambhav nahin he, kyonki iskaa arthvyavastha par behad gambhir asar padegaa
 But he said that the government is considering partially deregulating diesel prices
 petrol keemton ke bare main mantri ne kaha ki unki raay yah he ki yahaan bhi isaki keemten america kii tarah tay kii jaani chahie
 In the US, the price of petrol changes every day and all companies have different prices

 Rane said that in the Congress election advertisements Prithviraj Chavan has not been projected as the chief ministerial candidate
 unhone kaha ki 15 oktober ke chunaav main mukhya chunavi takkar congress or bijepi ke bich he
 When Rane was asked that Prithviraj Chavan has been prominently featured in the Congress election advertisements and has actually been exposed as the Chief Ministerial candidate, he said the advertisements show Chavan when he is the Chief Minister
 But, these advertisements do not present him as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 varisht congress netaa se jab poocha gaya ki kya vah mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar hai, to unhone jawaab diya, beshak

 The number of jobs created in the IT sector in the US so far this year is half of what it was last year
 kansalting form jaanako associats kii ek report main yah baat kahi gai he
 According to data obtained from this study of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 6,6600 new IT jobs were generated in the US between 10 months of January to October
 jabaki yadi pichley saal inhen maheenon main america ke iti kshetra main 114,000 naukariyaan jenerate hui thim
 According to MV Janulatis, CEO of Janco Associates, if you look at the data for the last 24 months, it can be clearly seen that the creation of new jobs in IT is decreasing
 unhone purvanumaan lagaaya ki saal 2016 main iti naukariyon kaa srijan saal 2013 ke str par rahegaa
 The comments jaanako vishleshan ke mutabik, 2013 main 7,5000 nai (iti) naukariyaan paidaa hui thim
 Whereas, 130,000 new jobs were generated in the year 2014 and 112,500 new jobs in the year 2015 in the IT field
 janulattis ne iske liye iconmik karkon ke atirikt, bracit se judi anischitataaon ke chalate hiring kam kiya janaa bhi ek kaaran bataaya
 Apart from this, the US elections, immigration policy were also influential factors in this regard
 unhone bataaya- is susti kii vajah sirf iconmik kaarak nahin hai
 Companies are not hiring
 jab tak bracit ke baad padane vaale prabhaavon ko lekar bazaaron par asar daalane vaale karkon ko lekar tasviir saaf nahin hogi, yah jari rah saktaa he
 Market change factors such as the Paris Agreement, Brexit, immigration policies and their implementation in the US and abroad, as well as the uncertainties arising in the Middle East about the uproar, may be followed by some changes
 2017 main bhi iti jobs ko lekar koi khushnuma tasviir nahin he
 Many companies may keep budget tight in 2017 in anticipation of sluggishness
 unhone bataaya- kai company agjecutive anisht kii ashanka se aihtiyaati kadam uthaa rahe hai or nae saal main company bajet flats yaa kam rakhane kaa purvanumaan laga rahe hai
 There is a general opinion that it is easier to spend less in advance than to spend more in advance and cut back on expenses later
 beuro of lebar statisticks ke is adhyayan se praapt hue data ke mutabik, janvari se oktober yani 10 maheenon ke bich america main 6,6600 nai iti naukariyaan utpann huin
 Whereas if in the same months last year, 114,000 jobs were generated in the US IT sector
 jaanako associats ke siio emvi janulattis ke mutabik, yadi pichley 24 maheene kaa data dekhen to spasht taur par dekha ja saktaa he ki iti main nai naukariyon kaa srijan ghatata ja rahaa he
 He predicted that the creation of IT jobs in 2016 will be at the level of 2013
 tippaniyan According to Janco analysis, in 2013 7,5000 new (IT) jobs were created
 jabaki, saal 2014 main 130,000 nai naukariyaan or saal 2015 main 112,500 nai naukariyaan iti field main jenerate hui thim
 In addition to economic factors, Zanulatis cited a reduction in hiring due to uncertainties associated with Brexit
 iske alaava america chunaav, imigration policy bhi is babat prabhavakaari kaarak rahe
 He told - The reason for this slowness is not just economic factors
 companiyaan hiring kar hi nahin rahi hai
 This may continue until the picture is clear about the factors affecting the markets after the effects of Brexit
 bazaar par prabhaav daalane vaale kaarak jaise kii paris samjhauta, bracit, avrajan nitiyaan or unka yues va videshon main lagu kiya janaa or saath hi middle east main uthapatak ko lekar paidaa hui anischitataaon par tasviir saaf ho, iske baad kuch badlaav dekha ja saktaa he
 Even in 2017, there is no happy picture about IT jobs
 kai companiyaan 2017 main susti kii ashanka main bajet tite rakh sakati hai
 He told that many companies are taking precautionary measures due to the fear of executive evil and are forecasting to keep the company budget flat or low in the new year
 ek aam raay yah ban rahi he ki pehle hi adhik kharch kar dene or baad main kharchon main katautee kar dene se zyada aasaan he pehle hi kam kharche kar lenaa
 According to MV Janulatis, CEO of Janco Associates, if you look at the data for the last 24 months, it can be clearly seen that the creation of new jobs in IT is decreasing

 BJP MLA Champion said that i do not consider Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi as Bapu, the country did not get freedom due to his spinning wheel, but got this freedom after the sacrifice of millions of people

 agar nehru jinna ko pradhanmantri bana dete to aaj kashmir samasya paidaa hi nahin hoti
 Champion said that Mahatma Gandhi, who is called so-called Bapu, i do not consider him as Bapu, he was filled with anger and arrogance
 vibhaajan kaa niyam mahatma gandhi ne aage badhaayaa jo ki angrejon kaa niyam tha
 The champions did not stop here, they also questioned the character of Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru
 unhone kaha ki sardaar patel ko 10 main se 10 vot padane par bhi baapu ne nehru ko pradhanmantri banaakar loktantr kii hatya kar di
 He further said that in the hands of those who were not capable, Bapu handed over the power of the country, who had no idea of the culture of India, their clothes also came from abroad
 unhone nehru ko lekar aapattijanak shabd bhi kahe
 The conspiracy of Mahatma Gandhi and his petty mentality and narrow ideas have lost the nation's fleet
 sardaar patel ji ke saath bhi gandhi shadyantr karata rahaa or nehru jaise aadmi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri bana diya

 When i asked director Vishal, he said that this is not a cheap film, the content is good
 phir maine apni maan se bhi puchha, or unhen koi takalif nahin thi
 During the shooting, everyone supported them a lot
 maine jaisaa sochaa tha vaisaa bilkul nahin tha

 The government is going to rein in many driving license makers with the same name
 jald hi centre, rajyon se driving license banavaate vakt aadhaar card se pahchaan karnaa anivaary karne ko kahegaa
 Aadhaar card will be necessary to get a new driving license or renew an old one
 aisa isliye kiya jayega taaki ek shaks ko ek se zyada driving license jari na kiye jaaen
 a person has had more than one driving license, and many cases have occurred when those who violate the traffic rules get a second driving license when the driving license is suspended
 kuch maamalon main farji pahchaan patr ke liye bhi galat tareeke se driving license banawaye gaye

 oktober se lagu ho saktaa he nayaa niyamsadak parivahan mantralay ne driving license ke liye aadhaar card jaruri karne kii yojana par kaam shuru kar diya he

 sutara ne bataaya ki aadhaar number ke bieometrics detel se is tarah kii gatividhiyon par lagaam lagegi or nayaa niyam oktober se lagu ho saktaa he
 According to difficulty sources for those having more than one driving license, the Aadhaar card alone will be sufficient documents to establish the identity of an applicant
 agar kisi ke paas aadhaar card nahin he to use duusare dastavej jamaa karne honge
 a plan to enable rtos to keep records of these details is being worked out
 jisase pataa lag sakegaa ki aavedak ke naam se desh main kahin pehle se koi driving license to jari nahin he
 Data has become digital
 Until recently, rtos were working on manual systems
 haalanki abanational informctics centre(nic)ne zyaadaatar data ko RTO ke record ke liye aplod kar diya he

 On Saturday, Hrithik Roshan broke the silence on the hrithik-kangna controversy for 2 years
 unhone pehali baar is controvarsi par tivi channel republic ko khulkar bayaan die
 Hrithik responded patiently to e-mail leaks, photoshopped photos and relationships with Kangana
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah intervyuu kisi par keechad oochhaalane ke makasad se nahin he, balki apana paksh rakhane ke liye he
 Know how Hrithik responded to Kangana's explosive allegations
 rithik bole-main chup rahata to log kangana kii baat par yakeen kar letekangana-rithik kii pehali mulakatakangana se meri pehali mulaakaat saal 2008 yaa 2009 main filmcitski shooting ke dauraan hui thi
 But we have never been good friends
 hamane kits main saath kaam kiya
 She used to send me videos of training and stunts
 jiskaa main unhen feedback detaa tha
 Perhaps that is why they thought i liked them
 kangana ne mujhase kaha tha ki vah mujhase kaaphi prabhavit thi
 i have never been in a relationship with Kangana
 kangana ke saath jordan vakyakrish-3 kaa jordan shedul khatm hone ke baad kangana mujhase is film ke baad apane kariyar ke bare main baat karnaa chaahati thim
 i told him, i am tired
 subah baat karenge
 But at night she started playing my doorbell loudly
 jiske baad mujhe apane assistant ko bulaanaa padaa
 In the morning, his sister came to Rangoli and apologized to me on behalf of Kangana
 is vaakye ke baad main kangana ke aasapaas akele naa rahane kii koshish karata tha
 Kangana was not engaged - Hrithikkangana claimed that Hrithik proposed to her in Paris in 2014 and got engaged
 isapar rithik ne kaha, sagaai to bhul jaao
 i never had a face-to-face conversation with Kangana
 us dauraan main paris main hi nahin tha or yah baat mere passport se sabit ho sakati he
 Hrithik said on the e-mail controversy, Hrithik said on the much-discussed e-mail leak controversy, "I received e-mails from Kangana with abusive language in Hindi
" jisapar unki bahan ne kaha maine unki idi hack kii he
 Later rangoli changed its stand again
 rithik ne hroshan@email
 com also denied that he had his ID in the name
 bataa den
 Kangana was being talked through this email account
 unhone kaha, jab bhi kangana mere aasapaas hoti thi to vah mujhase sharmaati thi
 That is why she used to send me mail
 kangana ne 3000 mail bheje jinamein privet tasviren or videos the
 During this, Hrithik also clarified that he never said that Kangana has Aspire Syndrome
 kangana se afaire-vivaad: 2 saal baad rithik ne 766 shabdon main di safayeeis vajah se chup the rithikitne lambey samay tak chup rahane ke sawaal par rithik ne kaha, main sahi plateform par sari baton ko kahana chahta tha
 These charges were leveled through a third person
 main daraa hua tha ki mere shabdon ko galat tareeke se liya jayega
 If i act strongly, i will be called aggressive and i will be emotional
 i can be called weak
 yadi main chup rahata to log kangana kii baat par yakeen kar lete ki meraa unke saath koi relation rahaa he
 So i had to speak about it
 jab rithik se poocha gaya ki unhone kangana ke saamne jaakar sari baaten kyon spasht nahin kii
 To this, he said, i was forbidden to do so by the Mumbai Police Commissioner as it could increase the tension considerably
 kangana ne riject kii thi salmaan kii 'bajrangi bhaijan', mili thim gaaliyanus party main saikadon log or therangoli dwaara post kii gai kangana or rithik kii intimet tasviir par bhi rithik ne apni safai di
 He said, there were hundreds more in this party
 ham sab enjoy kar rahe the
 In it, Suzanne, Dino Morea etc
 were all in the mood for fun and we were doing a photo shoot
 mere doston ne agle din is party kii kai tasviren share kin
 But this photo was cropped and promoted
 agar koi apane phaayde ke liye mere naam kaa istemaal kare to mujhe koi fark nahin padataa

" vahiin, tambaakoo virdohi kaaryakartaaon ko aahat kiya he
 " shivasena ne gandhi ke bayaan ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki ek ore jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne tambaakoo-rodhi abhiyaan shuru kiya he, jabaki duusari ore unki party ke hi saansad logon ke bich 'bindaas ho tambaakoo khao, cancer kii phikr bhagaao' kaa prachaar kar rahe hai
 The party said that Modi has taken up the cleanliness of the entire country, but he should first crack down on those who chew tobacco and spit in public places
 prayek kuch maheenon main drushti bhram (optical ilugen) sambandhi koi na koi tasviir internet par aati he or logon main kautuhal bhar detii he
 This time, a simple looking picture, which shakes the mind and contains a big secret in itself, is forcing many people to scratch their heads
 is tasviir ko manovaigyanik (experimental psychologist) akiyoshi kitaoka ne 22 march ko twit kiya he
 In this picture, small and square boxes of white and black color are made like chess
 lekin isamen manovaigyanik akiyoshi kii tasviir bhi chuphi he
 Now the question is, can you find that face in this picture? It's not that easy either
 tippaniyan On his Twitter thread, Kitaoka not only shared the picture but also gave details of the Illusion
 lekin isse pehle ki ham aapako bataaen, aap khud tasviir par najar daaliye
 Do you see a smiling face in it? One of my portraits pic

 com / urmdspcwnh - Akiyoshi Kitaoka (@akiyoshikitaoka) March 22, 2017 kya aapako tasviir main cheharaa nahin dikhaa? ab ise ek kinare se dekhnaa shuru kiijie yaa phir chalate phirte hue ise dekhen
 a Twitter user has given such advice
 aap ise kuch duuri se bhi dekhne kii koshish kar sakat hai
 googletag
 cmd
 push (function () {googletag
 display('adslotnativevideo'); }); In a tweet, Kitaoka described it as saying that what has really happened to this picture is that high frequency components are obstructing the perception of law contrast object
 ise masking phenomenon kehete hai
 He simplified this elusion a bit in the tweet below

 apane twitor thread par kitaoka ne na sirf tasviir share kii he balki ilugen kaa vivaran bhi diya he
 But before we tell you, let yourself look at the picture

 aisi salaah ek twitor yujar ne di he
 You can also try to see it from some distance
 ek twit main kitaoka ne iskaa vivaran dete hue likhaa he ki vastav main is tasviir ke saath ho yah rahaa he ki hai frequency ghatak lau contrast object kii dharna main baadha pahunchaa rahe hai
 This is called masking phenomenon
 unhone neeche ke twit main is ilugen ko thodaa saral kiya he

 com / xf41n5oocq The election in Uttar Pradesh is now in its final phase
 is antim daur main banaras main voting honi he
 Banaras is the parliamentary constituency of the Prime Minister, so all parties are eyeing the seat here
 bijepi ne bhi apane garh ko bachaane ke liye sari takat jhonk di he
 All the leaders are making big promises here, but in the midst of these promises, Banaras alone is shedding tears of its plight in some corner
 uski sud kisi vaade main najar nahin aati
 All the big ministers of BJP are currently camping in Benaras
 banaras ke ek sabhaagaar main kendriya mantri smriti irani bhi bhaajapa ke paksh main vot kii apil karte hue najar ain
 Apart from Smriti, almost all the big ministers of BJP are in Benaras these days
 ve jagah-jagah sabha karke bijepi ke shashan kaal main hue kaam ko janata ke bich main bataa rahe hai
 Union Minister Arun Jaitley is trying to show businessmen and entrepreneurs how much beneficial schemes the government has brought for them
 banaras kii sarajameen par mantri bade-bade vaade to kar rahe hai par banaras kii badahaali apni jagah badastoor he
 The roads of Benares are struggling with the problem of jam
 har jagah kooday ke ambaar hai
 About 600 metric tonnes of garbage is released every day in Banaras
 isamen se 500 metric ton kooday ke nistaaran kaa daawa kiya jaataa he lekin jameen par har jagah gandagi he
 Not only this, Ganga is equally dirty
 ganga ke darkate ghat apni kahani alag bayaan kar rahe hai
 Those fighting for the Ganges are deeply disappointed that this problem does not become an issue
 banaras kii samasyaon kii fehrist itani hi nahin he
 Leaders are engaged in making their own party's air, but the air of Benares itself has become poisonous
 banaras kii kai sadaken dhul ke gubaar ke bich bamushkil dikhaai padati hai
 The air pollution indicator machine states that PM-2
 5 kan 990, piem-10, 687
 Up to 9 micrograms per cubic meter is found periodically
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki puure shahar kii phijaan main dhul ke kan jindagi ko bejaar kiye hue hai
 This thing also beats the youth of Banaras and they also say that these basic issues are missing in the elections
 saaf he ki banaras pradhanmantri kaa sansadeey kshetra hone ke baad bhi apni badahaali ke liye aansu baha rahaa he
 The reason for this is both the state and central government, in whose fight Benares is helpless
 chunaav main donon hi sarkarein apni-apni party ko jitaane ke liye banaras main deraa to daale hai par afsos ye he ki banaras kii is durdasha kii charchaa koi nahin kar rahaa he
 It is clear that despite being the parliamentary constituency of the Prime Minister of Benares, he is shedding tears for his plight
 isaki vajah rajya or centre sarkaar donon hai, jinaki ladaai main banaras bebas he
 In the election, both governments have camped in Benaras to win their respective parties, but the regret is that no one is discussing this plight of Banaras
