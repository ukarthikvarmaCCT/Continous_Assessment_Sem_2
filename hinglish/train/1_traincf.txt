 But this news is a terrible truth
 amritsar ke ek ghar main ek maa ke haathon aisa gunaah hua ki sunne or dekhne waalon kaa dil dahal uthaa
 Creepy Vardatamala is from Amritsar in Punjab
 kehete hambaccheke liye sabase mahfuj jagah hoti he maa kii god
 One-and-a-half-year-old innocent Harman would also think so
 wo bhi dulaar se maa kii god main machalata tha
 Harman was once the sun and moon of his mother's eyes
 lekin dedh saal kii jindagi main jis sach se harman kaa saamana hua uski kalpana koi bure se bure sapane main bhi nahin kar saktaa
 Burning the innocent alive on that day, when mother Baljit Kaur put something like water on Harman, he considered it as a mother's loving anger
 maa kii patharai ankhon kii hakeekat dedh saal ke bachche ko kaise pataa chalati
 But that heartless mother threw a burning stick on a piece of her liver
 or maasoom harman aag kii lapaton main ghir gaya
 The innocent mother kept calling the burning mother, the merciless mother had gone to burn her red, but that innocent boy was calling the burning birds
 koi maa itani pathar dil kaise ho sakati he ki bachche ko jalataa hue dekh sake
 But her merciless mother did the same
 wo apane bachche ko chalate hue dekhati rahi
 And when he died, he made a noise to help
 police ke saamne gunaah kabuulamamla police tak ja pahunchaa
 The police was not digesting the child's burn in the house
 lihaaja police ne haadase ke vakt vahaan maujuud maa se sakhti se poochtacha kii
 And that mother could not suppress the truth in her chest for much longer
 police poochtacha main usne apana gunaah kaboor kar liya
 Husband's suspicion made the murderer mother Baljit Kaur had broken in front of the police
 usne apana gunaah kabool kar liya tha
 When he told the whole scene in front of the police, the policemen also came to him
 balajit cor kaa kahana tha ki uskaa pati harman ko apana betaa nahin maanata tha
 And beat him mercilessly
 vah pichley chaar maheene se pati se alag rah rahi thi
 He sacrificed his innocent child in the scorching fire of relationships
 padosiyon par lagaaya tha jhootha iljaames
 P
 krime lakhbeer singh ne bataaya ki balajit cor ne pehle bachche ko jalaane kaa jhootha iljaam padosiyon par lagaaya tha lekin baad main sakhti karne par usne gunaah kabool kar liya
 Police arrested Baljeet Kaur and produced it in court
 jahaan se uske gunaah ko sangeen aparaadh maanate hue use jail bhej diya gaya
 Whatever be the truth of Baljeet Kaur and her husband's relationship
 lekin dedh saal ke harman kii dardanaak maut itnaa daraavna sach he ki jo kisi bhi halaat or majaburi kii daleel se pare he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne congress or uske netaaon ke rashtrabhakti ko lekar ‘‘pareshaan’’ hone ke kaaran ravivaar ko un par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 The Prime Minister said that they should at least learn from the Mudhol dogs of North Karnataka, who have been inducted into the Indian Army
 modi ne kaha ki congress main itani giravat aa gayi he ki party ke ek netaa ‘‘bharat ke tukade honge" jaise naare lagane vaale logon ke bich chale gaye or unhen samarthan diya
 He was apparently referring to Congress President Rahul Gandhi's visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus when a controversy erupted over the campus for allegedly raising anti-national slogans
 pradhanmantri modi ne chunavi raily main kaha, ‘‘jab desh mendeshbhaktike bare main charchaa ho, jab rashtrabhakti, raashtragit vande maataram ke bare main koi charchaa hoti he to kuch log pareshaan ho jate hai
 Modi said that patriotism gave the country independence and "today if we have started a big campaign of development on the basis of patriotism, then Congress and its allies see a conspiracy in patriotism
" deshbhakti kii baat se ve pareshaan ho jate hai
 "he said whether anyone would have thought that after independence, the Congress would fall to such an extent that today Congress leaders are moving among those who shout slogans like" There will be pieces of India "
 unhone kaha ki congress or uske netaa itane gir gaye ki jab bhartiya sena ne seemaa paar sargical strike kiya to unhone iskaa saboot maanga
 Modi said, "those who have trouble in the name of patriotism, who are against the discussion of patriotism and for whom patriotism is the cause of trouble, i want to say to them that if you do not want to learn from others, please do not learn
 - Whether they are your ancestors or the Congress of Mahatma Gandhi
 ’’ unhone kaha ki kam se kam bagalcote ke mudhol kutton se seekhney kaa prayaas karen
 His reference was to Mudhol dogs recently inducted into the Indian Army
 modi ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe pataa he ki unka ( congress) ahankaar saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya he
 The people of the country have rejected them, but they are still not ready to come to the ground
 isliye main unase ummid nahin karata ki ve mudhol kutton se bhi kuch seekhenge
 "mudhol Hound are dogs of Indian breed

 Defense Minister AK Antony had to make a statement in Parliament
 haalanki unke bayaan par bhi jamkar bavaal hua
 Instead of directly accusing the Pakistani Army in his statement, he said that the people involved in the attack were in uniform of the Pakistani Army
 sutron se jo jaankaree hamen mili he, vah kai sawaal khadey karti he
 According to the information, Army DG (military Operations) Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia had detailed the incident to Defense Minister Antony
 e ke antni ko khaas taur par bataaya gaya tha ki yah hamalaa border ection team (BAT) dwaara kiya gaya tha, jisamen pakistani faujee or hathiyaarband aatankwaadi shaamil the
 Read: 'antony has given way to Pakistan to escape' Even after this description, when AK Antony gave a speech in Parliament, he referred to the attackers as 'people in the uniform of Pakistani army'
 sansad main bijepi ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha ki hamane khud pakistan ko batch nikalne kaa rasta de diya he
 But, changing the statement by the Defense Minister in such a way, that too after the briefing of the army officer, questions are being raised on how right it is - the first question is whether AK Antony really censored his speech
 did
 unhen isaki kya jarurat thi?-yadi unhone apane bhaashan main badlaav kiya to kyon
 What were the reasons behind this? - Why was the Army briefing ignored? - Do our Defense Ministers adopt a soft attitude towards Pakistan and Pakistan Army? multinational company essar group se jude phone tanping cond main ek nayaa mode aa gaya he

 The Citizenship (amendment) Bill, the three promises of the bjp's passport declaration from Parliament, the Modi government, which is in power for the second time in the whole of the country, is continuously implementing the promises made in its election manifesto
 bijepi ne 2019 ke chunavi ghoshnaa patr main jammu-kashmir se artical-370 hataane, naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon laane or teen talaak ke khilaaf kanoon banane kaa vaada kiya tha
 That is why the Modi government has been able to fulfill these three big promises within seven months of coming to power, as well as pass the UAPA and SPG amendment bill to curb terrorism
 bataa den ki narendra modi sarkaar ke paas loksabhaa main bahumat he, lekin rajyasabha main bahumat kaa aankada kam he
 This is the reason that in the last five years the Modi government was not able to take any major decision
 modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal main jab se grahamantri pad kii jimmedaari amit shah ko mili he, uske baad se sarkaar ek ke baad ek bill ko paas karaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 The citizenship amendment bill was passed by the home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday to discuss and pass the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the state, and he also referred to the BJP manifesto
 shah ne kaha ki chunaav se pehle hi hamane janata ke saamne naagarikta sanshodhan bill laane kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, jise janata ne apana samarthan diya
 Nothing can be greater than a mandate
 isse saaf jaahir he ki sarkaar apane ghoshnaa patr ke kiye hue vaade ko amalijama pahana rahi he
 The Modi government has managed to get the Citizenship Amendment Bill passed by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, after which Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsi refugees who came to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh will get citizenship
 teen talaak se muktinarendra modi sarkaar ne lagaataar duusari baar satta main aate hi sabase pehle muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak se nijaat dilaane kaa kadam uthaaya
 The Modi government passed the 'protection of Muslim Women Marriage Rights Bill-2019' from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to ban triple talaq completely and declare it a crime
 rajyasabha main bahumat na hone ke baad bhi modi sarkaar is kanoon ko amalijama pehanaane main kaamyaab rahi
 The BJP included it in the letter in its election announcement
 anuchhed-370 ko kiya beasaramodi sarkaar ne apane duusare kaarykaal main sabase aitihaasik faisla jammu-kashmir ko lekar liya jo jansangh ke jamaane se party kii praathamikta suchi main sabase upar rahaa he
 The government, along with taking steps to neutralize Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, also worked to divide the state
 bijepi jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane kii maang kaaphi lambey samay se uthaati rahi thi, lekin ye masalaa har baar talataa hi rahaa
 The manner in which the Modi government in its second term Home Minister Amit Shah neutralized Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, also surprised the opposition
 modi sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad kashmir main ek desh, ek vidhaan or ek nishaan lagu ho gaya he
 Passing UAPA Bill, in order to curb terrorism, the Modi government has passed the 'prevention of Unlawful Activities Amendment Bill 2019' (UAPA Bill) from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to make it legal
 iske kanoon ke baad ab sarkaar kisi bhi vyakti vishesh ko aatankwaadi ghoshit kar sakati he or uski sampatti bhi jabt kar sakati he
 Whereas, till then, the anti-terrorism law only provided that it could ban a group, but not someone individually
 espiji sanshodhan bill pasmodi sarkarspecial protection group (espiji) sanshodhan bill 2019ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha se paas karaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 This bill only provides for providing SPG protection to the Prime Minister and apart from him no special person will be entitled to this security shield
 is bill main sanshodhan ke baad gandhi parivaar ke sadasyon or purv pradhanmantri ke parivaar waalon ko milane vaali espiji suraksha hataa lee gai he
 Now it is a provision to withdraw this security from a specific person even after being the Prime Minister and after 5 years of his removal from office

 Let me tell you that this feature has been launched exclusively for Instagram Stories

 iske liye aapako profile main jaakar menu main tap karnaa hoga
 From here you can make a list of close friends
 list banane ke baad hi aap is close group ke liye instagram stories bana sakate hai
 You will not get information from friends about whether they have been placed in a group or removed
 saath hi is privet list ke liye koi friend request bhi nahin daal paaegaa
 However, these stories will appear in Green Circle instead of Regular Pink Circle
 saath hi aap keval ek hi close frends kaa group bana sakenge
 Terrorist David Headley made a big disclosure in the court about the conspiracy of 26 / 11 terror attacks and said in court that Ishrat Jahan was a suicide bomber of lashkar-e-taiba
 hedli ne kaha ki use ishrat ke bare main mujammil bhatta ne bataaya tha
 Headley said, 'bhatt told me that he was told by Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi that one of his female fighters was killed in an encounter in India
 ' haalanki ishrat kii maa ne apni beti ko nirdosh bataaya or kaha ki hedli jhooth bol rahaa he
 The mother said, He is lying head-darkly, where mother Shamira Kausher said, 'ishrat is innocent
 vah aatanki nahin he
 Headley is lying, he is a terrorist
 hamen uski baton kaa kyon vishwaas karnaa chahie
 He also said that in all the reports of SIT and CBI, he has been described as innocent
 ham kanoonee karrwai karne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 i am in contact with my lawyer
 vakil ne bhi hedli ke aaropon ko nakarisase pehleishrat jahankey parivaar kii vakil vrinda grover ne bhi kaha ki bijepi ishrat ko aatanki tehraane ke liye itani kyon utaavali he?
 He also said that the lawyer had spoken in Headley's tongue and now it is getting political
 hedli ne kaha ki wo lashkar kii kisiatmghaatee mahila hamalaavarko nahin jaanata
 Like Amitabh Bachchan of Kaun Banega Crorepati, a government lawyer was giving Headley three options, is this proof? This is a political angle
 jaanch se pataa chalaa tha ki ishrat jahaan kii hatya kar di gai thi
 Why is the BJP so keen to prove that Ishrat is a terrorist? Did we not give Kasab a trial? : Vrinda Grover, lawyerpic

 The film 'fagli' released today is the story of four childhood friends - Dev, Gaurav, Aditya and Devi, who are with each other in every happiness and sorrow
 
 
 ve noujvaan hai, isliye mouj-masti karte hai, lekin phir bhi har kisi ke apane-apane sapane hai
 
 
 One day these four go to teach a lesson to a shopkeeper, because he molested the goddess
 
 
 isi bich unki mulaakaat hoti he, bhrasht police afasar chautaala se, jo inaki zindagi main uthal-puthal machaa detaa he
 
 
 Jimmy Shergill is in the role of this corrupt police officer
 
 
 'fagali' kai saamaajik muddon par roshni daalati he - jaise ladkiyaan kahin bhi mahfuz nahin hai, netaaon or system main bhrashtachar bharaa padaa he
 
 
 By the way, the film has also raised serious topics like drugs and sexual abuses
 
 
 film ke pehle hi seen main dev dilli ke india get ke saamne khud ko aag main jalaane kii koshish karata he, lekin police use bachaa leti he
 
 
 Dev did this because according to him no one hears the voice of the common man, but everyone hears the story of a dying person
 
 
 'fagali' main dikhaaya gaya he ki musiibat or bure vakt main sabhi dost ek-duusare ke saath hai
 
 
 'fagli' may have tried to highlight many social issues, but it is monotonous
 
 
 kahani bilkul bikhri hui he, screenple behad kamazor he, film main zarurat se zyada shorsharaba he or sangeet bhi kamazor he
 
 
 Vijender Singh, who won a medal in boxing, failed to win hearts by acting
 
 
 mohit marwaah or kiyaara adwani ne thik-thaak kaam kiya he
 
 
 On the other hand, in the role of Chautala, Jimmy Shergill tried his life very hard, but remained a victim of the weak story
 
 
 mujhe lagata he shaayad lekhak rahul handa or nirdeshak kabir sadanand ke dimag main desh, samaaj or yuvaaon se jude muddon par film banane kaa idia aayaa hoga or clymex ko 'rang de basanti' ke andaaz main gadhana chaahate honge, lekin 'fagali' dekhakar mahasoos hota he ki ise banane main donon behad ulajh gaye or vichaar dharaa kaa dharaa rah gaya
 
 
 From my side the rating of the film is - 2 stars

 khaadya mantralay ke tazaa aankadon ke mutabik arhar daal phir mahangi hone lagi he
 Between 26 November and 4 December, arhar dal became costlier by five rupees or more in 11 cities
 arhar daal siliguri main sabase zyaada 25 rupee prati kilo mahangi hui, jabaki varanasi main 13 rupee, kota main 15 rupee, kanpur main 10 rupee or lakhanu main 10 rupee prati kilo mahangi hui
 Retailer Ashok Khurana of Delhi's South Avenue Colony says, "we expected a new crop of arhar dal to come to market after November and prices would come down
" lekin har rose arhar daal 2-3 rupee mahangi hoti ja rahi he
 
 
 Don't know when the prices will stop
 " The concern is not limited to lentils

 45 lakh hectares have been sown in less area
 yani chaaval or gehun donon kaa utpaadan kaa ghatana tay he
 This simply means that the rice and wheat that reached the market last year will reach less than this year
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the rise in the price of arhar dal has given the opposition a chance to raise its finger again on the government
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki jab sarkaar ko pataa tha ki har saal arhar daal kii khapat kitni he or paidaavaar kitni hui he, to modi sarkaar ne zarurat ke mutabik aayaat karne kaa faisla kyon nahin kiya
 If hoarding in the states is a big reason for this, then why are the prices of pulses not coming down in bjp-ruled states? jaahir he sarkaar kii koshishon ke baavjood phir se arhar daal mahangi ho rahi he
 Despite action against hoarding and large scale imports, pigeon prices are rising again in many cities

 According to the latest data from the Food Ministry, arhar dal is again becoming expensive

 We will pass laws to abolish and prohibit practices like triple talaq and nikah halala '
 gauratlab he ki teen talaak ke mudde par kai muslim sanghathan or vipakshi partiyaan bhartiya janata party ko gherti ai hai
 The BJP in its proposed bill spoke of punishing three divorced husbands, while many parties opposed the condition
 haalanki, loksabhaa main teen talaak bill paarit ho chukaa he, jahaan par bhartiya janata party ke paas bahumat tha
 But this bill could not be passed in Rajya Sabha, the government did not have majority in the upper house
 rajyasabha main congress samet kai vipakshi dalon ne kai close par sawaal uthaae the
 What is Nikah Hallala? According to the provisions of the current Muslim Personal Law, if a Muslim woman is divorced and wants to marry again from the same husband, then she must first marry another man and have a relationship with him
 phir anya shaks ko talaak bhi dena hoga
 This entire process has been called Nikah Halala

 However, Janata Dal u rejects this allegation of BJP outright
 uskaa kahana he ki, harnaut ke prakhand adhyaksh indrajit sen prasad ko fansaaya gaya he
 Janata Dal u spokesperson Neeraj Kumar says that liquor was planted in the block president's house
 168 bottle videshi sharaab baraamad hui30 agastako utpaada vibhaag ne harnaut ke prakhand adhyaksh indrajit sen prasad ke ghar par chapa maar kar teen cartoon
 That is, about 168 bottles of foreign liquor were recovered
 unhen giraftaar bhi kiya gaya, lekin uske baad ki kahani kuch agal ho gai
 Nalanda District Magistrate and SP start questioning the Excise Inspector Deepak Kumar who takes action in this matter
 aisa pehali baar hua ki karrwai karne par utpaada adhikari se na sirf poochtacha kii gai, balki unhen 12 ghante tak deepnagar thane rakhaa gaya he
 Deepak Kumar, the excise inspector himself, took Suvendra Kumar in police custody and wondered what his fault was
 unhone kanoon ke mutabik karrwai kii phir jila prashasan unke saath aisa kyon kar rahaa he
 Not only this, the wife of Inderjit Sen Prasad, who lost the election of the chief, is also being questioned by the former head of the Lohra Panchayat, Suvendra Kumar, in police custody
 police ne suvendra kumaar ko kahaan rakhaa he, ye uske parivaaravaalon ko bhi nahi pataa he
 The police have arrested the former chief because he suspects that the same nationality team has set up a liquor plant at the home of UK Harnaut block president
 darasal prakhand adhyaksh kii patni madhumita sinha purv mukhiya kii patni ko haraa kar is baar mukhiya bani he
 And the basis of doubt is that liquor has been planted to avenge the defeat

 In which the lock was closed
 unka ye bhi kahana he ki soochna milane par wo ye nahin dekhte ki kiskaa ghar he
 Three cartoons of foreign liquor were caught in the raid
 kanoon ke mutabik indrajit sen prasad ko turant giraftaar kar liya gaya
 But the next day the case was reversed
 jile ke dm or espi ko laga ki yah sharaab plat kii gai he
 Therefore, the excise officer was interrogated as well as the former chief is also being interrogated
 kanoon kaa jo galat istemaal karegaa us par bhi hogi kaarywaijanta dal you ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar ke mutabik bihar utpaada niyam ke anusaar sharaab, jinke ghar se milegi un par kathor karrwai hogi or jo is kanoon kaa durupyog karegaa us par bhi kathor karrwai hogi
 It has been found in Harnaut that the liquor has been planted, so the people who got it done for harvesting are also subject to this law and it is not allowed to take the law in their hands
 unka ye bhi kahana he ki jahaan sharaab pakadi gai he us ghar kii bhagaulik sthiti aisi he ki jahaan garrej tha usame sharaab rakh diya ho, or aam logo ke munh se bhi ye baat nikali kii unhen fansaaya gaya he

Accused of trapping her husband, BJP state president Mangal Pandey has accused Nitish Kumar that if any officer of excise department has given the JDU leader Arrested with the children, then Well not that official

 Robert Vadraka, who specializes in jokes and tells an interesting story, is of the opinion that Indians do not have a sense of humor
 isamen sachai ho yaa na ho lekin yah usase to behatar he jahaan koi shaur hi na ho
 The humor is a little tricky
 kisi kaa majaak tehra or kisi kii izzat-aabru par ban ai
 Whether it is folk literature or common conversation, Indians have a lot in both cases
 unke paas gande nasli chutkule se lekar rasukhadaaron par hansane kii sharif aadat bhi he
 What will you say about this SMS, which started moving from mobile to mobile as soon as the talk of the rise of Vadra, the most famous businessman in the real estate in Indian history, went public
 rahul gandhi ne maayusi ke saath apni mummy se kaha: 'pehle seedbluji, phir tu-ji, phir kol-ji or ab jija ji

 america samvidhan nirmaataa or press kii aazaadee ke bade samarthak thomas jeffrasan par san 1800 main apni jaagir main ''congou haram” chalaane kaa iljaam laga
 But like the good Christian, Jefferson did not extend his other cheek
 unke samarthakon ne unke pratidwandvi jon adams par yah iljaam lagaaya ki ve apni nijee jaruraton ke liye 'british veshyaaon’ kii taskari kar rahe hai
 Look at the British here
 yah aisa hi he jaise kisi bhartiya netaa par yah iljaam lage ki vah pakistani haram chalaa rahaa he
 The best spot-test sample came in 1884 when Grover Cleveland was accused of being the father of an illegitimate child

 Cleveland won after winning the election: He went to the White House, ha ha ha! It is one thing to abuse your enemies and satirize those who voted for you and put them in power
 is a joke

 Perhaps they are familiar with its common and colloquial interpretation, which means a country ruled by monkeys and selling bananas to national wealth
 shaayad yahaan iskaa prayog adhik buddhi vaali upama ke taur par nahin ho saktaa, khaskar aise main jab bharat main yah bahes chal rahi ho ki bahurashtriya companiyaan videshi pratyaksh nivesh ke jariye yahaan kya kar sakati hai
 Someone has made Vadra aware of the poor dimension of possibility because he removed those things from his Facebook very quickly
 lekin ve ise logon kii smriti se itnaa jaldi nahin mitaa paaenge kyonki unke virdohi kisi ko yah baat itani jaldi bhuulane nahin denge
 Mr Vadra's party Congress is struggling with uncertainties
 iske pravaktaaon ne pehle arvind kejariwal ko dhamkaana chaha jinhone kahani ko saarvajanik tathy bana diya he; phir unhone wadra ko aise maasoom ke taur par pesh kiya, jin par badmaashon ne galat iljaam lagaae
 He soon learns that Kejriwal is not one to be intimidated and has begun to substantiate his accusations with other evidence

 Everyone likes the Angryman avatar of politics
 or netaa engri hone ke saath yang ho to sone pe suhaaga
 Perhaps Bilawal Bhutto, son of former President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari, has taken this matter very seriously
 tabhi to vah aksar engriman dikhne ke firaaq main rahete hai
 But unknowingly, he becomes a laughingstock on social media every time
 pehle kashmir ko bharat se chhinane kii napak ichha, phir sijafire ulanghan ko lekar narendra modi ko naseehat, ise badbolapan naa kahen to or kya
 By the way, he expressed his desire to take Kashmir away from India
 haalanki modi ko naseehat twitor ke jariye di
 Now the question in everyone's mind is whether Bilawal has recently become angry, or is it old
 you tub par bilaval ke puraane bhaashanon ko khangaalen, to pataa chalata he ki janaab ko siyasat main farji gusse kaa tadakaa lagane kii aadat si he
 Now the call to remain in the headlines has also become known

 No matter what the dialog is, he does not speak without reading

 And with every word there is a fluctuation in the way of screaming, seeing you will also say that the practice is good

 Eight months, Malle became the foreign center of the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) during the tenure of the then Maldives President Abdulla Yameen

 Abdulla Yameen is considered to be China while Ibrahim Mohammed is considered to be pro-india

 sorce: newsflicks If you want to stay healthy then fruits have to be included in your diet
 falon ke seven se sharir ko kai jaruri poshak tatv mil jate hai
 Due to lack of time, we can eat fruits comfortably
 falon main kai poshak tatv, khanij, antioxident hote hai lekin ek jaruri baat ye he ki in poshak tatwon ko adhiktam maatra main kaise liya jaae
 You should also take special care of what is the right time to eat fruits
 aapako khaane se pehle yaa baad main kabhi bhi fal nahin khaane chahie
 In the morning you can eat fruit in breakfast
 khaanaa khaane ke baad fal khaane se bachanaa chahie
 On an average, you consume 300-400 calories in a single meal
 falon main fructose hota he jo aapaki calories kii sankhya bahut badha detaa he
 This is the reason why eating fruits after eating is forbidden
 khaane ke saath inkaa pachan mushkil ho jaataa he
 Consuming fruits before meals or after meals can make you a victim of gas, constipation or stomach pain
 jab aap khaane ke saath falon ko shaamil kar lete hai to pet main falon kaa pachan ruk jaataa he
 Your digestive system is involved in digesting food at that time
 pet main pade fal jahrile ban jate hai or diet tub main ikaitha hona shuru ho jate hai
 It can affect the acidosis of the stomach and cause constipation problems
 aapako pet main jalan bhi mahasoos ho sakati he
 Some other things should be kept in mind while eating fruits - do not consume milk or curd with fruits
 fal khaane ke kam se kam aadha ghante tak kuch naa khaaen
 The best time to eat fruits is considered to be morning
 khaali pet fal khaanaa aapaki sehat ke liye phydemand sabit ho saktaa he
 However, do not eat citrus fruits on an empty stomach as there may be a problem of acidity
 subah seb, aam or kelaa jaise fal kha sakate hai
 When you eat watermelon, avoid eating anything with it
 isamen pani kii khub maatra hoti he jisase pachan mushkil ho jaataa he
 Eating fruit according to the season can also prove beneficial for health
 garmi ke dauraan kachche or mithe falon ko khaane kii salaah di jaati he

 ' shivpal ne congress se gathbandhan ke sawaal par kaha tha ki congress bhi ek secular party he or agar vah bijepi ko haraane ke liye hamase sampark karti he to ham uskaa samarthan karenge

 lekin lagata he ki pragatisheel samaajawaadee party or congress kaa gathbandhan moort rup nahin le paaya he

 Significantly, on Tuesday, the police questioned Gautam for three and a half hours, but after interrogation, the police refused to give a clean chit to Gautam and opposed Gautam's anticipatory bail in the court
 peshey se stock brokar or glamer ke shaukeen gautam vohara mumbai ke khaar thane par pahunche to the bade bharose ke saath, lekin saadhe teen ghante kii marathon poochtacha ke baad unhen samaj main aa gaya ki unki mushkilen abhi khatm nahin hui hai
 He is not far from the police suspicion on the death of model Viveka Babaji
 mangalvaar ko subah saadhe nau baje hi khaar thane par pahunch gaye the gautam vohara
 The police was already ready with a bundle of questions
 beeti raat jo tees sawaal kiye gaye the, saaf lag rahaa ki police unke jawaab se santusht nahin he or wo gautam se puraa sach nikaalnaa chaahati he
 So once again the police asked - what was your relationship with Viveka
 gautam ne phir vahi jawaab doharaaya ki dosti ke sivaay viveka se unka koi rishta nahin tha
 After a few more questions and answers, the police arrived on the night of 24 June, the last night Viveka and Gautam met
 police kaa sidhaa sawaal tha- 24 june kii raat kya hua tha?gautam vohara ne phir vahi jawaab doharaaya jo agrim jamaanat arji daakhil karte vakt court main di thi
 Gautam said that he was passing through Bandra when he received a call from Viveka
 wo viveka se milane chale gaye
 Viveka was tense
 unhone uskaa tanaav dur karne kii koshish kii
 She was taking a lot of medicines
 cigarette pi rahi thi
 The next question of the police was - how long have you been with Viveka? Gautam said - He left from around nine o'clock in the night
 police ne phir poocha- kya aapkaa unase jhagada bhi hua tha? gautam ne kaha- nahin, koi jhagada nahin hua tha
 This answer of Gautam is not able to satisfy the police
 kyonki padosiyon ke hawaale se lagaataar khabaren aa rahi hai ki 24 june kii raat viveka ke ghar se lagaataar ladaai jhagade kii awaajen aa rahi thim or shaq he ki isi jhagade ke baad viveka ke man main khudakushi kaa vichaar aayaa
 On the other hand, the police have also investigated Viveka's SMS
 viveka ne aakhri 7 dinon main gautam ko pyaar bhare kai massej bheje the
 But on 24 June he wrote in the SMS i Hate You police ko ye suraag ahm lag rahaa he
 At present, police are awaiting investigation report of laptop, mobile, e-mail besides Viveka's Visra report
 yahi vajah he ki police philhal gautam ko clinit dene ke mood main nahin
 That is, the needle of suspicion rests on Gautam in the Viveka Babaji suicide case

 vanade or tii-20 kii baat karen to duniya main bahut kam khilaadi pant jaise hai, main un paanch khilaadiyon main ungaliyon par bhi nahin gin saktaa
 'shastri said,' Pant (despite all the media reports and writing by experts) is in a good position with the Indian team
 visheshgyon kaa ye kaam he, ve bol sakate hai
 Pant is a special player and he has already done a lot and he will learn, this team management will support him
 'isse pehle khud shastri ne mushkil paristhitiyon main shot chayan ko lekar pant kii aalochana kii thi
 Ravi Shastri had said that if Rishabh Pant keeps repeating his mistakes, then he will have to bear the brunt of it
 is par shastri ne kaha, 'maine galati karne par khamiyaja bhugatne' kii baat kahi thi, agar koi galati karegaa, to main use bataaungaa
 Am i just there to play tabla? But this player is world class, this player can be destructive and explosive too
 ham use vah puraa samarthan denge jisaki use international cricket main chamakane ke liye jarurat he
 Shastri said, 'don't say that i made that statement because of the performance of the team management, Pant
 agar koi galati karata he to mujhe use bataane kii jarurat he
 But this player is world class, this player can fly any bowling order
 hamen unhen samarthan dena hoga taaki vah antarrashtriya cricket main behatar kar paaen
 'sunil Gavaskar had given Pant's former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said that Rishabh Pant should be given more and more chances before the T20 World Cup to be held in Australia next year
 gavaskar ne kaha, hamen ab mahendra singh dhoni se aage dekhne kii jarurat he

 dilli main apharan or dhokhadhadi kaa ek bada hi ajeeb maamla saamne aayaa he
 In fact, the Delhi Police, while solving a case of kidnapping, saved the victim properly and then arrested the victim for fraud
 maamla purvi dilli ke shakarpur kaa he
 On January 12, the police received a complaint that a man named Kushal Chopra had been kidnapped and the kidnappers were demanding Rs 36 lakh

 People from all over the country send suggestions and the result is that the government's attention has shifted to problems

 Thousands of people associated with the cleanliness campaign, the Prime Minister said that in 'mann Ki Baat' last month, we had taken a pledge that Gandhi will run a cleanliness drive for 15 days before the birth anniversary and connect the countrymen with it

 Everyone has gathered

 ) aajkal hamamen se kai log is baat par naaraaz hai kipetrol or dijal ke damajitne kam kiye ja sakate the, utane kam nahin kiye ja rahe
 This complaint is also valid because the government is increasing excise duty
 exise duty wo tex hota he jo kachche tel se petrol yaa dijal banane ke baad uski keemat par lagata he
 The government has increased excise duty four times since November
 agar ye badhotaree na hoti to petrol 7
 75 paise per liter and diesel 6
 50 paise prati litre or sasta ho saktaa tha
 Necessary for Excise Duty Economy: Now 8 in Delhi on one liter petrol
 95 rupee or dijal par 7
 96 is being charged in the name of excise duty
 chaar baar exise duty badhane se centre sarkaar ko is saal takreeban 20 hajaar karod kii extra kamai hone kaa anumaan he
 All this money is going to the government treasury
 centre sarkaar ke liye ye paisa lottery kii tarah he, kyonki wo isse sarkari khajaane ke ghate ko jidipi ke 4
 a target of 1% can be met
 matlab ye ki petrol-dijal par badha exise tex desh kii iconomi ko majboot banane ke kaam aa rahaa he
 If the condition of the economy improves, the country and the public will benefit
 ab tel par koi sabsidi nahin haikai log ye daleel bhi de rahe hai ki jab july 2004 main kaccha tel 50 dollar ke aasapaas hua karata tha, tab petrol 35-36 rupee / litre bikta tha
 Why is it so expensive today? But this is also a semi-truth
 tab sarkaar petrol or deazal par ek moti rakam sabsidi ke taur par diya karti thi
 Because of that, prices were lower than today
 sabsidi kii ye rakam kahin or se nahin, balki janata se vasule gaye tex se hi aati thi
 This means that even those who did not drive, used to spend the oil burning in the rich car
 shukr he ki aaj petrol or dijal, donon par hi sabsidi khatm ho chuki he
 Why is petrol in India costlier than Pakistan? For political gains, some parties are often arguing that oil is being sold in India even more expensive than Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal
 ye baat sahi he, lekin iskaa bhi ek vaazib kaaran he
 Be it Pakistan or any other South Asian country, the petrol or diesel that is being sold there in terms of quality is like oil sold in India 10-15 years ago
 aaj bharat main euro-3 or euro-4 standerds lagu hai, jo ki pradooshan kam failaate hai or nai technology vaali gadiyon ke liye thik hote he
 Oil sold in India cannot be compared with Pakistan
 itnaa hi nahin, pakistan sarkaar ke gairjimmedaar ravaiye kaa hi nateeja he ki vahaan par sarkari tel companiyaan diwalia hone kii kagaar par hai or puraa desh petrol sankat se jujh rahaa he
 Even cheap oil can become a problem 10 years ago the number of vehicles on the roads was less than half of what it is today
 tab petrol bhale hi 35 rupee litre tha, lekin logon kii kharch kii kshamta bhi aaj ke mukaable kaaphi kam thi
 Imagine yourself what will happen if petrol becomes Rs 35 a kg today
 shaharon main sadakon par achaanak gadiyon kii sankhya kai guna ho jaaegi, jinhen control karnaa naammumkin hoga
 The damage to the environment caused by these trains is different
 pakistan main petrol sankat ke peeche bhi yahi vajah he
 Due to cheap petrol, people left CNG and started driving on petrol, which suddenly increased the demand for petrol
 kachche tel kii ghatati keemat kaa dhokhaaye sahi baat he ki kachche tel kii antarrashtriya keemat aaj kareeb 60 fisadi ghatakar 50 dollar prati bairal par aa chuki he, lekin hamen is baat ko yaad rakhana hoga ki distribution karne vaali companiyaan kachche tel kaa sauda 6 se 8 maheene tak advance main kar chuki hoti hai
 That is, even though crude oil has become cheaper today, but the oil that is being purchased at this time may be at the rate of 6 months old
 aisi sthiti main tel companiyon kii musiibat he ki wo ghatati keemton kaa phayda janata tak kaise pahunchaaen
 Pakistan is suffering as a result of not allowing the oil companies to compensate for the old losses due to the decrease in the price of crude oil, where nowadays people are standing for hours by laying lines for petrol
 jaahir he aap bharat main ye sthiti kabhi nahin chahenge
 Prices of petrol and diesel should keep decreasing according to crude oil, this is necessary, but this decline should not be so much that new types of problems arise
 agar sarkaar ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat exise duty badhaakar petrol or dijal ke daam par control rakhane kii koshish kar rahi he to isamen kisi ko harj nahin hona chahie
 Qatar Airways said on Tuesday that it is in talks with it to buy a stake in the airline indigo

 The Doha company also said that it does not want to enter into an agreement with spicejet in the future

 Why is mercury increasing? The mercury in the capital is constantly increasing, which can be due to many reasons

 Because if it rains, the chances of falling mercury increases

 Although the Army did not mention in its written statement, what was its role in the Pampore operation? It is clear that she has left behind the controversy and is engaged in a smoldering case
 kisi oparation ke credit ke liye suraksha balon ke bich main kheenchaatani kaa to sawaal hi nahin paidaa hota
 The army questioned the media reports that are talking about a credit conflict between the CRPF and the army
 vipareet halaat main jis tareeke se suraksha bal or khufia agenciyaan kaam kar rahi hai, aise main is tarah ke sawaal khadey karne kaa koi matlab nahin he
 The comments gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko pampor main hue aatanki hamale main aatankiyon ko kisne maaraa isko lekar bavaal shuru hua tha
 The army first claimed that it killed the terrorists, then later said that it was a joint operation of the army and the CRPF
 baad main somvaar ko siarpief ke diji ke durga prasad ne kaha ki aatankiyon ko siarpief ke javaanon ne maaraa
 The army came to the scene after the operation was over
 vaise sena ne apane is likhit bayaan main is baat kaa koi zikr nahin kiya, pampor oparation main uski bhoomika kya thi? saaf he wo vivaad ko peeche chhodkar maamle kii lipapoti main lag gai he
 Significantly, there was a ruckus about who killed the terrorists in the terrorist attack in Pampore on Saturday
 sena ne pehle ye daawa kiya ki usne aatankiyon ko maaraa, phir baad main kaha ki ye sena or siarpief kaa sanyukt oparation tha
 Later on Monday, CRPF DG k Durga Prasad said that the terrorists were killed by CRPF personnel

 The emergence of Manmohan Singh in 2004 was unprecedented, from the tired academic discussions of Saturday Club at India International Center in the capital Delhi to the busy atmosphere at Seven Race Course Road

 Strongly opposed to the suggestion of being raised in the media, refusal to contest the Lok Sabha elections in 2009, relinquishing control over the government by allowing key appointments to be held above their heads and not leaving the post despite being humiliated by the Surrey general Rahul Gandhi
 baru kaa kahana he ki manmohan jo viraasat chhodkar ja rahe hai, asal main vah unki niyati nahin he
 Baru compared the Prime Minister to Bhishma Pitamah, who took an unwavering oath to defend the throne
 unka kahana tha ki rajvansh ke prati belos vafadari kisi rajtantr main bhishma pitamah kaa daayitv rahi hogi, lekin manmohan ke liye yah bahut khatarnaak bhul sabit hui
 From great liberals to great destroyers, he sank the credibility of his branch and almighty prime minister's office

 Actually the Principal Secretary is the officer who acts as the administrative bridge between the Prime Minister and the rest of the Ministers

 a
 nair kabhi vaise pradhan sachiv nahin ban sake, jaise unke pehle ke log the
 Brijesh Mishra was not limited to the Principal Secretary just before Nair
 maine ek baar majaak main doctor singh se kaha tha ki vaajapeyi ke samay pradhan sachiv aise kaam karata tha, jaise vahi pradhanmantri ho, jabaki unke bare main kaha jaataa he ki pradhanmantri singh asal main pradhan sachiv kii tarah kaam karte the
 This statement was about Dr
 Singh's habit of meditating closely, interfering with every small task of administration, and presiding over long tiring meetings with officials
 vaajapeyi aisa bahut kam karte the
 Doctor Singh ignored this
 ve acchhee tarah jaanate the ki yah vyangy baan he, jisase sabit hota he ki rajnatik bos sonia thim
 Nair was not Dr
 Singh's first choice for the post of Principal Secretary
 ve vohara ko lenaa chaahate the, jinhone mujhe meri niyukti kii khabar di thi
 Vohra was not only a Humsafar refugee from West Punjab, now a part of Pakistan, but both also taught at the University of Punjab
 vohara doctor singh ke kuch saal baad oxford bhi gaye the
 Vohra even canceled his trip to London to work in the PMO
 vaise sonia gandhi ke dimag main ek or ritred tamil iees adhikari kaa naam tha, yah naam bataane kii chhot mujhe nahin he
 He worked with Rajiv Gandhi and had an image of a capable and honest officer
 unhone siddhant rup main sarkaar main phir shaamil hone kaa sonia kaa nimantran thukraa diya, kyonki unhone apane pita se vaada kiya tha ki ritair hone ke baad phir sarkari naukari nahin karegaa
 After the name of these two eminent officers was cut, Dr
 Singh turned to Nair
 ritair hone se pehle nair gujral ke kaarykaal main pradhanmantri ke sachiv rah chuke the or punjab ke mukhya sachiv bhi rahe the
 Nair's name was endorsed strongly by Rakshapal Malhotra, a family friend of Doctor Singh
 malhotra chandigarh main centre for research on rural and industrial deveopment (siararidi) ke adhyaksh the
 Dr
 Singh himself had been its president and Nair was a member of the Board of Directors
 gujral ke piemo main kaam karne ko chhod diya jaae to nair ne kabhi bhi grih, vitt or raksha jaise taqatvar mantralay main sachiv kaa pad nahin sambhala tha or na hi kisi pramukh aarthik mantralay main rahe the
 He was only secretary in rural development and less powerful ministries like environment and forests
 matlab naukarshahi main unka vajan kam tha
 Nairs of short stature were always adorned, but their height was not like Brijesh Mishra
 mishra kaa dabang vyaktitv apane aap dhyaan khinch letaa tha
 Nair rarely gave any clear or imprecise opinion on any file and always signed it by writing a discussion, please
 ve sanyukt sachivon or up-sachivon jaise kanishtha adhikariyon ko maukhik nirdesh dena pasand karte the
 Subordinate officers then had to write these instructions on file as their advice
 yah jokhim se bachane kaa khantee naukarshahi tarika he, taaki khud kabhi kisi vivaad yaa musiibat main na fansen
 Nair relied heavily on Joint Secretary Pulak Chatterjee, who worked with Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, for important policy decisions
 pulak bhi nair kii tarah is gam se peedit the ki unki apni seva ne kabhi unhen pratishtha nahin dilaai
 Current IAS officer Pulak never worked in any major ministry
 un par rajeev gandhi kii najar uttar pradesh main apane nirvachan kshetra amethi main jila adhikari ke rup main padi or uske baad ke rajeev ke piemo main upasachiv banakar aa gaye
 After Rajiv's death, he preferred to work at the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and did some good social development, but this meant that his name had become completely associated with the Gandhi family
 sarkaar main pulak kii vaapasi sonia gandhi ke nijee staff main hui, jab ve loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa thim
 Pulak joined the PMO on the recommendation of Sonia Gandhi
 ve kareeb-kareeb rojaanaa sonia se milte the or unhen us din ke nitigat muddon par jaankaree dete the
 Pulak was the only person who used to take instructions from Sonia Gandhi on the main files approved by the Prime Minister's Office
 asal main to pulak hi pradhanmantri or congress adhyaksh sonia ke bich niyamit sampark kii sabase ahm kadi the
 He was also the main contact in the PMO for the National Advisory Council headed by Sonia Gandhi
 is mili-juli takat ke baavjood mujhe lagata tha ki nair or pulak kii jodi brijesh mishra ke saamne nahin tikti he
 Brijesh Mishra ran Vajpayee's Prime Minister's Office very well
 madhya pradesh ke purv congressi mukhyamantri ke putr mishra ne bhale hi rajnay kii training lee thi, par raajnneeti unke khun main thi or ve acchhee tarah jaanate the ki gathbandhan sarkaar main pradhanmantri kaa dabadabaa badhaane ke liye koun-si chaal chali jaae
 Another great feature of Mishra
 ve jokhim uthaane se nahin darate the
 At the same time, both Nair and Pulak officers lacked this essential quality
 siyasat or prashasan ke najuk maukon par mishra datakar faisla lene or pradhanmantri kii taraf se maamle ko aage badhaane ko taiyaar rahete the
 This is the greatest convenience for a Prime Minister
 unhone may 1998 main vaajapeyi ke saath parmaanu pareekshan karne or bharat ko parmaanu hathiyaar sampann desh ghoshit karne kaa faisla lekar yah naam kamaaya tha
 Mishra's status increased and strengthened Vajpayee's dominance within the government
 lekin yah haisiyat nair ne kabhi hasil nahin kii
 *** "the National Security Advisor became the boss of IB and RAW in a way" The Prime Minister refused to take daily briefings from the intelligence chiefs
 i realized that Dr
 singh kaa unase (mani dikshit) behatar sambandh tha, jo narayanan ke saath kabhi nahin ho paaya tha
 It also seemed that Narayanan was included as the third power in the PMO to express his respect for Sonia 
 emke yaa mike, jaisaa ki unke samakaleen unhen bulaate the, rajeev gandhi or narsingh raav donon ke hi daur main desh kii aantarik khufia agency khufia beuro (ibi) ke pramukh rahe the

 "he would laugh at meeting ministers, officials, journalists and others like this, and would make the front of the person nervous about what to know if they were not joking
" asal main narayanan ne khud hi aisi afvaahon ko tool di thi ki ve har kisi kii taak-jhaank karne kii firaaq main rahete hai
 He seemed quite happy to tell me that he keeps an eye on credit card spending of all influential editors
 pradhanmantri ke vimaan main lambii yatraaon ke dauraan ve hamen aisi kahaniyaan sunaaya karte ki kaise kai pradhanmantriyon ne apane saathiyon par najar rakhane ke liye unhen bulaayaa tha
 If those stories were true then Dr
 singh apwaad hai
 Not only did he overcome the greed of spying on his comrades, but he refused to take daily briefings from intelligence chiefs and lost his chance to get such news
 ve aisa karne vaale pehle pradhanmantri hai
 In return, the heads of the IB and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were asked to meet the National Security Advisor (NSA)
 mujhe nahin lagata ki khufia agenciyon ke pramukh pradhanmantri ke badale kisi duusare se sari khabaren sahi-sahi bataate honge or ve pradhanmantri se hi sidhe roj kii brifing par jor dete rahe
 Sometimes the Prime Minister used to take such briefings, but in reality only the National Security Advisor became his boss
 dikshit kii jagah jab narayanan enese banaae gaye to unhone is adhikaar kaa had darje tak istemaal kiya
 This round was not without controversy
 ro ke adhikariyon ne un par ibi ko zyada tavajjo dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 One of the reasons for his strong hold on the entire system was his professional ability, and the other reason was the honor given to the subordinates due to not having an officer
 unka makasad hota tha ki kaam puraa hona chahie, iske liye bhale hi unhen kaaphi chote afasaron se sidhe hi baat kyon na kerani pade
 He used to call me "ED" while talking to friends, ie the name fbi's powerful boss J
 edgar hover ke liye liya jaataa rahaa he, jinase america ke raashtrapati bhi ghabaraaya karte the
 Dr
 singh bhi narayanan kii pratishtha se satark rahete the or rahanaa bhi chahie
 Sometimes when he handed over his sensitive work to me, he made a clear gesture that no one should know about it
 ***‘‘naitikta ke maamle main khud par sakht lekin dusron par lunjpunj ravaiya’’manmohan apane saathiyon ke bhrashtachar par aankh munde rahemujhe lagata he ki saarvajanik jivan main bhrashtachar ke bare main manmohan singh ne tajindagi ek hi ravaiya apanaaya

 In this case, he considered himself a little less because he was not the political officer to appoint those people to the post of minister
 iskaa vyaavhaarik matlab yah tha ki ve apane mantriyon kii karatuuton par aankh munde rahete the
 He was expected by the leadership of the Congress Party to take action against the tainters of his government
 isi tarah ve sahyogi dalon se chaahate the ki ve apane daagiyon se nibaten
 His conscience was always conscious of what he was doing and he wanted others to use their conscience

 Dr

 Due to this double standard of morality, the public opinion in UPA-1 was not so much against him as the cases were not open then
 unke pehle kaarykaal main media kaa focus unki nitigat pahal par tha
 But when the scandal broke out in UPA-2, his public image suffered a major setback, failing which he failed to recover because no policy initiative was left that would have reversed the situation

 *** "I don't want you to shine my image" The Prime Minister allowed Rahul to take the credit of NREGA and upa's second win when a scheme like MNREGA reached the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) from the National Advisory Council and Ministry of Rural Development

 isamen daawa kiya gaya tha ki rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri se naregaa (mahatma gandhi kaa naam jode jane se pehle yah isi naam se jaani jaati thi) kaa dayera desh ke 500 gramin jilon tak badhaane kaa anurodh kiya
 Then it was implemented only in 200 extremely backward districts of the country
 maine patel se kaha ki piemo main pradhanmantri se milane aane vaale netaaon kii ore se press statement jari karne kaa niyam nahin he

 Later that evening a senior journalist of the Indian Express called me and tried to find out if Dr

 In UPA-2, Dr
 singh par bhi media isi tarah kataaksh or vyangy karata rahaa
 And i continue to doubt whether Dr
 singh bhi bhishma kii tarah the?greek kathaon or shakespeare ke naatakon kii tarah bhartiya puranic kathaon main bhi aisa nayak nahin he, jo daagdar na ho
 Except the mortal man, God is also not free from demerits
 bhagwaan ram kaa sita ko tyaagna aisa prashn he jo kabhi khatm nahin hua
 So there are many questions that Dr
 singh ko bhi sataate rahenge
 The biggest is that when he realized that he had no control over his government, why did he not resign? His failure to show loyalty to the Congress or to rise above the promise made to Sonia did not work either
 na hi use puraskrit kiya gaya
 Except this he remained in office even if power was not in hand
 rahul ke uttaradhikaar ke liye maarg prashast karte rahanaa, party par ek hi parivaar kaa niyantran bane rahane main sahyog dena to or bhi galat tha
 Bhishma had also made such a mistake
 unhen kauravon ke uttaradhikaar kaa virodh karnaa chahie tha
 Above all, loyalty to dynastic succession is monarchical, not democratic
 dow
 Singh made a huge mistake in understanding this

 de kahati hai, dilli vaale pehla sawaal poochhate hai, ''aap kis caloni (punjabiyon kii tarah colony ke uccharan kii nakal) main rahete ho? '' or phir kahati hai ki iske badale koi mumbaikar yah dekhtaa he ki uskaa bank balance kitna motaa he
 Sitting a few blocks away on the stage, Moni jokingly says, "you should say, George Clooney?" Day's account of Lahore's atmosphere was overshadowed that season
 magar sachaai yahi he ki moni or de jis samaaj kaa varnan karti hai, uskaa shiraja ab bikharata ja rahaa he
 The atmosphere of pleasant Lahore and Delhi @ Mumbai is changing now
 pakistan main to aisi majahabi kattarta haaavee ho gai he, jis par afsos jataane ke alaava moni ke paas or koi chaara nahin he
 As far as Dey is concerned, he also realizes that his era is getting old

 Janu, in which world are we reaching! Dear Shobha, Hello! Since the last time we met, i have cherished so much to tell you
 main tumse milane pehle hi aa jaati, agarche yah vija-shija kaa stupid bakawaas nahin hota
 Sure, what the hell is that, man? You cannot even cross the border without committing hundreds
 goron se vija kii bheekh maangana bada bura lagata he, lekin desi saahabon kii khushaamad karnaa to katai acha nahin lagata
 At least not for the ones we eat and drink
 garibon kii tarah, jo har cheez ke liye har roj bheekh maanga karte hai
 We are not accustomed to all this
 vija kii baat karen to suna he ki hamaare videsh sachiv bhi chupchaap pichhawaade baatcheet chalaa rahe hai
 Trying to do Sulla (reconciliation) after two years of Kutti

 If our Governments (governments) had sent you and me to negotiate in exchange for the babus of Islu (islamabad) and South Block, everything would have been resolved in a blink of an eye because you know, you and I, how much is common between us (shared) Is cricket among us, our celeb friend, Bollywood, all the same
 paan, aam, shaadiyaan, shallu, sholay sab kaa saajha he
 And then all our mines are shared
 bhai aamir khan, salmaan khan, irfan khan, fawaad khan, imran khan, rahamaan khan or beshak sabase mashhoor hamaare khan market ko bhala kaise bhulaayaa ja saktaa he
 Shobha Jaan Ho, for me there is Harrods first, then Dubai Mall — where Shork has its emporium — and then mine markets matter to me
 bas, khan market main bhi koi equarium khul jaae to vah mere liye duusare number kaa ho jayega
 Forgive me for the moment
 haa, yaad aayaa, hamaare bich tivi drama bhi ek jaisaa he
 Mummy is a serial called Chakori or something similar to you, she is absolutely laughed at
 jab bhi main bulaati hum, ve kahati he ki bathroom main hum
 But i know that she is watching Chakori
 iske alaava unhen hameshaa dast lagi rahati he
 Well, just think, instead of talking to your daughter, someone watches the drama! One should not talk like this about his wife, but mother is also such a fraud

 "he said," You know son, i only take Dove
 isse chamadi mulaayam rahati he
 "yes, Shobha, i remembered, we have one more thing in common: Bandish! So, spring is restricted for us
 gavaments (sarkarein) kahati hai ki yah hamaari bhalaai ke liye he kyonki kaaphi ladke patang udaate chhaton se gir jate hai
 But what is going on in my mind is that if the government is so much concerned about our safety then why not ban Kalashnikakras (klassnikov rifles and pistols), yes? You can easily buy them as chapatis in the market
 or haa, hamaare yahaan utyub par bhi bandish he
 After all, you can see and hear something on youtube, which can cause a shock to innocent, humble people like us, or go straight to hell if you see it by mistake
 meraa andaja he ki aisi hi kisi vajah se boxbe waalon ke liye bif par bhi bandish he
 Hey listen, Bombay or should i ban it too? i do not want to hurt anyone's feelings, i am the only guest on an entry visa, and that too has been found after a lot of happiness
 
 
 
 Then i heard that there is a ban on you BBC documentary too? Do you know what shock you get yakeenan, aisi gavaments kaa jawaab nahin, jo hamaare moral welfare (naitik kalyaan) kaa har ghadi itnaa zyada kchayaal rakhti he, he na?vaise, shobhaa, ye videshi aise sho kyon karte hai yaa aisi baaten kyon karte hai, jo hamen is kadar jhakzor detii hai? or hamen duniya bhar main is kadar badnaam kar dete hai? meraa matlab ki ve hamaare bare main sirf acchhee-acchhee baaten kyon nahin kar sakate? tumhaare, mere or is charadivari ke bich, mere kchayaal se hamen nicha dikhaane kii sajeesh he
 This is just a matter of saying
 varanaa to shobhaa, ham unnat pracheen sabhyataa ke log hai, nahin? meraa matlab, puraane daur ke hadappa or moenzodaado jaise shahar, bhai apni sindhu ghati sabhyataa nahin thi? usamen un logon ne eent kii bani naaliyaan or dren vagairah khoja tha
 just think! Four thousand years ago, when Londoners and New Yorkers covered bodies with bear leather and ate insects, we used to sit in the crushed toilets of the Curavit
 ji haa! or pichley hakrate united neshans kii kisi branch kaa koi aayaa or hamase kehane laga ki 4 karod pakistani baahar bathroom karte hai or yah acha nahin he
 i wanted to tell him that brother, sorry, the poor people forgot to sit in the toilet and are doing the bathroom outside, then it is just our fault that their memory is gone? And just, Shobha, finally returned to work
 Go, parties, food, gts, o Baba, Get Together (weddings), weddings, etc
 har koi jo bulaata he, na jaao to bura maan jaataa he, na
 So, where does Shobha give leisure to those like us? oke dialing, ab ek kiti party ke liye bhaagna he

 From the Government of Maharashtra to the Chief Minister to the Chief Minister, everyone tried to persuade the farmers, but the farmers do not seem to believe at the moment
 tippaniyan Maharashtra Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar says that it is definitely not a good move to strike the farmer
 aisa agar sachmuch hota he to duniya chal nahin sakati, kyonki kisaan is duniya kaa anndaata he
 In such a situation, the government is trying not to strike the farmers

 saatven charan main 8 march ko 40 siton par chunaav hona he
 Purvanchal is called the gateway to the power of UP
 is kshetra se upi vidhansabha main kareeb 40 fisadi siten aati hai
 BJP has put all its strength in the campaign in Purvanchal
 prachaar ke liye piem modi khud pichley do dinon se varanasi main hai
 There are more than a dozen ministerial campaigns in different parts of Purvanchal
 purvanchal ko lekar bijepi kii ranneeti ke 5 aise pahalu hai jo upi chunaav main baaji palat sakate hai:1
 Modi Effect In 2014 general election, when BJP made Narendra Modi as the PM candidate, it was contested from UP as a strategy to bring Gujarati out of the image and Varanasi seat was chosen for this
 is faisle ke peeche ek ranneeti ye bhi thi kipurvanchal kii siton par bijepi kaa dabadabaabadhaayaa jaae
 Modi was enchanted all over UP and BJP got 73 seats out of 80 in his account
 ab vidhansabha chunaav main bhi vahiin jaadu dohraane kii taiyaari he
 Purvanchal gets 170 seats and for this, Team Modi himself has taken over the campaign
 2
 There have been enough reasons why the BJP, which has been claiming to contest the communal cardup election from the beginning, on the issue of development, suddenly came to the communal card by coming to Purvanchal
 khud piem modi ne shmashaan, kabristaan, ramajaan or diwali ke muhaavarey se siyaasi bayanon ke tir ek alag disha main mode die
 After this Sakshi Maharaj appeared and said that the cemetery is a waste of place
 bijepi kii isaranneeti kii katake liye akhilesh ne daanv chalaa or gujarat ke gadhon kaa muhaavara chhedakar bahes kii disha modane kii koshish kii
 The bjp's strategy behind the communal card in these two phases may be to gain by polarizing districts like varanasi-azamgarh-mau-gorakhpur

 Purvanchal Mission of Modi Cabinet PM Modi, not only 12 ministers of the cabinet are carrying out the campaign campaign of the party in Purvanchal
 is ranneeti ko amali jama pehanaane kaa kaam pichley saal tabhi shuru hua tha jab piem modi ne baliya se ujjwala mishan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 After this, Team Modi took a step forward in the Gorakhpur by giving a manure factory and AIIMS to make his grip in the area
 smart city kii list main banaras ko shaamil kiya gaya
 PM Modi often says in his rallies that he has taken up the task of changing the picture of this area
 ab team modi gaanv-gaanv main jaakar logon ko kendriya yojanaon kii jaankaree dene main lagi he
 Under this strategy, the Sangh has also been put on the ground so that the bsp's penetration in Purvanchal can be used to feed the lotus in UP
 4
 Targeting Bahubalis on the pretext of Katappa, on 27 February, Modi started his Purvanchal mission from Mau and while referring to the film Bahubali's character Kattapa, he said that this Katappa will eradicate Purvanchal's Bahubalis
 jaahir he piem kaa ishaara bahubaliyon ke dam par purvanchal jeetne kii koshish main lagi bispi par tha
 The BSP has strategized a victory in Ghazipur, Mau and Gorakhpur by bringing Mukhtar Ansari into the party
 piem modi kaa ye kattapa waar logon main bahubaliyon ke samrajya ke khatme kaa sandesh degaa or iske liye bijepi logon main paith banane kii koshish main he

 The motive was to take the idea of prosperity from the public
 bijepi yojana se khaasi utsahit he lekin saath hi vah congress kii shikaayat se dukhi he
 BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said that on the first day more than 4000 calls were received
 whatsap par bhi badi sankhya main suzav mili hai
 The response of the public has been very good on the first day
 lekin dukh he ki congress ne aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he, aisi shikaayat kii he
 In the complaint mentioned by Kailash Vijayvargiya, the Congress has said that the government has issued advertisements continuously from October 27 to 5 before imposing a code of conduct
 ye vigyaapan future empi task force ke ‘‘idia main ho dam to puraa karenge ham'' sheershak se jari hua he
 The government and BJP advertisements differ only in phone numbers
 congress ko lagata he ye sab sarkari paise kaa durupyog he
 Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha said that the BJP was using government programs in its name
 janata ko kya mila 
 
 
 Nothing is embarrassing, what worked in 15 years
 meri sarkaar meraa suzav ke naam se jari is abhiyaan main janata kii naaraazgi dur karne kii kavayad or bijepi ko janata se jodne kii ranneeti dikh rahi he
 It remains to be seen how much this benefits BJP in elections
 congress pravaktaa shobhaa ojha ne kaha jo sarkari kaarykram the uskaa apane naam par bijepi upyog kar rahi he
 What did the public get? 
 
 kuch nahin, sharmnaak he 15 saal main kaam kya kiya
 In this campaign released in the name of Mera Sarkar, my government is showing an exercise to remove public anger and a strategy to connect BJP with the people
