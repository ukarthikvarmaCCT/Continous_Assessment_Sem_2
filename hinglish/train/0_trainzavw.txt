 He has filed more than 50 petitions in the NGT for the protection of the environment and is currently the Vice President of Haryana Pond Authority
 paraali kii samasya kyon bani hui he?rabi or kharif kii fasal kaatane main dilli ke aasapaas haryana or punjab ke harvester upyog main aate hai
 These harvesters are made in such a way that they cut the crop to the height of the knees
 jisaki vajah se fasal ke avshesh (paraali) ko kisaan jalaakar kheton ko saaf karte hai
 If straw reapers are applied in the harvester, the crop will be cut from the bottom and will not be lost, but it is not possible
 aisa kyon nahin ho paa rahaa?15-20 saal pehle jab fasalein haath se katati thim tab paraali kii samasya hi nahin hoti thi kyonki tab jad se fasal katati thi lekin ab harvester kii galat takanic kii vajah se samasya paidaa ho rahi he
 i had filed a petition with the NGT in Madhya Pradesh to deal with this problem and from there all the collectors were ordered not to allow a harvester with no straw reaper to enter the district
 paraali kaa dhuaan kitna khatarnaak he?jab bhi paraali jalaai jaati he to bahut badi maatra main carbon dioxide or carbon mono oxide paidaa hoti he

 And are there alternative things to get rid of the problem of stubble? Ghaziabad has a National Center for Organic Farming
 usne aisa chemical banaaya he jo paraali par chhidakane ke baad ek maheene main use khaad main parivartit kar detaa he
 The government should distribute it to the farmers for free, which will reduce environmental pollution and will save lives

 The second T20 international match between Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and West Indies captain Carlos Brathwaite had different opinions after looking at the state of the field at Central Broward Regional Park, which was canceled due to wet outfield
 westeindies ko 143 ran par sametane ke baad bhartiya team ne do over main bina wicket ganvaae 15 ran bana liye the, lekin tabhi 15 minute tak hui tej barish se maidan ke kuch hisse main kaaphi keechad ho gai, jisamen maidan ke pavilion chor kii ore kaa gendbaajon kaa ran-ap bhi shaamil tha, jiske kaaran adhikariyon ko match radd karnaa padaa
 Brathwaite said, 'there were two-three things of concern in this
 pavilion kii ore dekhte hue, us chor kaa ran-ap or praayojakon (maidan par paint kiye gaye vigyaapan) ke paas shaayad mid on or phir pashchimi chor kii ore ek chota ptch (keechad kaa) tha
 ' unhone kaha, 'isliye meri raay main is par khelnaa asurakshit tha or agar ran-ap acha bhi tha to agar ek khilaadi us outfield par gend hit karata or koi uske peeche daudta or vah gir jaataa to yah us khilaadi ke kariyar kaa ant ho saktaa tha
 'so we would not like to play on such a ground,' Brathwaite said, 'we wanted the facilities and conditions as safe as possible for everyone's career
 ' However, Dhoni said that he has played in worse conditions during his career and he gave the example of the 2011 tour of England

 khagol vaigyanikon ne kisi anya solar system main maujuud ek aise planet ko khojkar tasviir lee he jisase hamaare jupiter jaise grahon ke banane ke sambandh main mahatvapurn jaankaree haath lagane kii ummid he
 It has been said in a recently released study
 vaigyanikon ne chil main ek telescope ke top par set kiye gaye nae gemini planet imager ke prayog se is grah ko khoja
 It was named 51 Eridani b
 yah dharti se 96 prakaash varsh duuri par sthit he
 It revolves around a young planet like the Sun and is twice as large as Jupiter
 yah un sabase chote grahon main se ek he jo apane solar system se itar paae gaye hai or jinaki tasviir lee ja saki he
 The comments telescope ne jo dekha, uske mutabik- yah apane janm ke 20 million saalon se lagaataar garmi hi radiat kar rahaa he
 Infrared light is being produced from that planet
 stenford uniwarsity ke estronomar macintosh or unke saathiyon dwaara science jaranal main is hafte ke ishyu main chape lekh ke mutabik, 51 Eri b se aise grahon ko vistaar se padhane kaa mauka miltaa he jo ab bhi apane nirmaan kii shuruaati paristhitiyon se prabhavit ho
 Methane gas was found most in the atmosphere of this planet like Jupiter
 is khoj se vaigyanikon ko yah bhi pataa chal sakane ke liye kuch sanket milenge ki aise gas ke bade planets aakhir banate kaise hai
 In a statement, University of Arizona scientist Travis Barman said that it looked like Jupiter billions of years ago, it is probably the youngest planet among 51 Eri b similar planets
 jo, hamaare grahon ke banane kii paheli ko sulajhane kii disha main mahatvapurn lag rahaa he

 us grah se infrared lite paidaa ho rahi he
 According to an article published in this week's issue in Science Journal by Astronomer Mackintosh of Stanford University and his colleagues, 51 Eri b offers an opportunity to read in detail the planets that are still affected by the initial conditions of their creation
 is jupiter jaise grah ke vaataavaran main methen gas sarvaadhik pai gai
 This discovery will also give scientists some clues to know how large planets of such gas are formed
 ek statement main uniwarsity of arizona ke vaigyanik travis barman ne kaha ki yah kharbon saal pehle jupiter jaisaa lagata tha, 51 Eri b vaisaa hi lagane vaale grahon main shaayad yah sabase yuva grah he
 Which, in the direction of solving the puzzle of the formation of our planets, seems important

 rahul iske saath hi rajya main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apni party ke prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat bhi kar rahe hai
 Why did Rahul choose this place for his first election rally? And what will be the effect of Rahul's political strategy

 This is the first meeting of Rahul Gandhi, who attacked PM Modi after demonetisation
 notebandi ko lekar sarkaar aae din nae farmaan jari karti he

 andolan kii aguwai yuva netaa hardik patel ne kii thi or is andolan ko yahaan ke patel samudaay kii ore se khub samarthan mila tha
 This community has been a major vote bank of the BJP
 congress ko shaayad yah bhi lag rahaa he ki maujuuda vakt main kisi yuva netaa kii gairmaujuudagi kaa phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he
 By the way, Gujarat was a stronghold of the Congress before the Modi-era in Gujarat
 ab aise vakt main jab is ilaake main bijepi kii sthiti thodi kamjor pad rahi he, congress is maukey kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 Two chief ministers have changed in the state after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister
 sattarudh party shaayad is asamanjas main he ki wo aglaa chunaav piem modi ke chehre ko aage rakhkar lade yaa maujuuda siem vijay roopani ke sahare chunavi maidan main utre
 In such a situation, the Congress hopes that it will strengthen its political ground in the state by keeping Rahul Gandhi ahead

 After winning the toss, the central region, who came out to bat first, scored 237 for seven wickets till the end of the first day's play, in which Bisht contributed 79 runs
 rajasthan ke is 26 varshiya ballebaaj kii tarah salaami ballebaaj faij fazal (49) or ashok maneria (37) bhi acchhee shuruyaat ko badi pari main nahin badal paye
 Skipper Piyush Chawla (30) was dismissed in the last moments of the day as the middle field also suffered
 stump ukhdane samay arindam ghosh 32 ran par khel rahe the
 However, the biggest blow to the central region came from Naman Ojha's return to the pavilion for only four runs

 Mahesh Rawat, who scored a century in the second innings in the semi-final against North Zone, could not even open the account today
 dakshin kshetra ne aath gendbaajon kaa upyog kiya or kaamchalau of spinner baba aparajit ab tak ke uske sabase safal gendbaaj rahe hai
 He took two wickets for 26 runs in six overs
 hanuma vihari ne bhi ek over main ek wicket hasil kiya

 Bisht was also cautious in the beginning but as soon as he got the loose ball of Pragyan Ojha he sent it for a six
 bisht ne iske baad bhi kuch aakarshak shot lagaaye jisase fazal kaa bhi aatmavishvaas badha or unhone bhi ran batore jisase lunch tak madhya kshetra 34 over main ek wicket par 34 ran tak pahunch gaya
 South Zone captain Vinay Kumar made consistent changes in bowling in the first season itself and tried seven bowlers

 Fazal came under his guise

 In this way Fazal missed the half-century by one run
 unhone apni pari main 127 genden kheli or saat chauke lagaaye
 All eyes were now on Naman Ojha, who was consistently scoring big scores from the last few matches
 unhone aparajit par khubasurat cover drive se chaukaa lagaaya lekin agali gend ko bhi drive karne ke prayaas main vah sahi shot nahin laga paye or vinayakumar ne dive lagaakar kaich karke dakshin ko keemtee wicket dilaa diya
 Aparajit's two wickets in one over gave the score to 94 for three

 Both of them adopted both vigilance and aggressiveness and played big shots only on loose balls

 maneria unki gend par flik karne ke liye aage nikal gayi lekin gend unako chaka gai or baaki kaam karthik ne puraa kar diya
 Gopal dismissed Rawat in the next over to send the middle field back to the backfoot
 gopal ne is bich bisht ko bhi ek do avasaron par pareshaan kiya lekin unki manjhi hui pari kaa ant pragyan ojha ne kiya
 The ball on his middle stump took the edge of Bisht's bat and turned it into a catch at midwicket
 rajasthan ke is ballebaaj ne 153 gend kheli tathaa 12 chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Ojha would have sent Ghosh to the pavilion as soon as he arrived, but Robin Uthappa dropped his catch
 chawla ne phir se ballebaaji main apane haath dikhaaye, lekin apana 100waan pratham shrenee match khel rahe madhya kshetra ke captain ne din ke aakhir main apana wicket ganvaa diya

 a small temple has been built by installing an idol of black colored bitch on the roadside between Revan village and Kakwara village of Mandiramoranipur

 This is the story behind the temple - this incident is many years old

 Locals state that at that time there was a tradition of mass feast in the village
 gaanv ke bhoj main ek kaali kutiya ko khilaane kii parampara thi or log bhi use puure sammaan se khaanaa khilaate the
 Once a day banquet was held in Revan and Kakwara villages
 us samay khaanaa khaane ke liye baithne vaale logon kii har pari puri hone ke baad ramatula pracheen vaadyayantra bachataa tha
 The animals there also used to reach there to eat food after hearing the sound of Ramatula
 isi samay ek kutiya bhi thi jo aawaaj sunakar revan gaanv ke kareeb pahunchi to kakvaara gaanv kaa ramatula batch gaya or kakvaara pahunchi to revan gaanv se khaanaa ke liye vaadyayantra kii aawaaj aa gai
 In the same vein, the bitch was deprived of both the feast of the village
 gaanv ke bujurg mangalasinh bataate hai ki kutiya biimaar thi
 Running and running, both of them sat in the middle of the village
 bhukh or beemaari kii vajah se usne vahiin dam tod diya
 The people of the village buried the bitch in the ground at the same place
 bataate hai ki jis jagah use dafnaaya gaya, wo sthaan pathar main tabdeel ho gaya
 People considered it a miracle and established a temple there
 kakvaara gaanv kii katari devi bataati hai ki aane vaali diwaali par yahaan dhoomdhaam se puja-archana kii jaati he, kyonki uski maut inhen dinon main hui thi
 Every wish is fulfilled by asking here
 kuch log ise andhvishwaas bhi maanate hando gaanv main is mandir ko lekar kaaphi aasthaa he
 At the same time, some people of Mauranipur consider it to be superstition
 patrkaar pramod chaturvedi kehete hai ki log duusare kii kahi baton par jaldi vishwaas kar letaa he
 This temple has been linked to the death of starvation and the fulfillment of the desire to bring prosperity to the house, so people not only believed the story of 'bitch Maharani' but also started worshiping it

 In a tweet, angry Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Monday used the word 'worthless', which is being targeted against rival leader Milind Deora, as mutual fighting in the Maharashtra unit of the Congress is touching new heights
 yah twit purv saansad sanjay nirupam ne mumbai main huin rahul gandhi kii reliyon main gaiyrhaazir rahane ko lekar chal rahi atakalbaaziyon se nipatane ke liye kiya tha
 Sanjay Nirupam wrote in the tweet without naming anyone, "the speculation and my suspicions about my absence from rg's Mumbai rallies are unfounded
 
 
 ek ahm paariwarik samaaroh ke chalate main puraa din, yahaan tak ki der raat tak vyast tha
 
 
 i had already informed them of this
 
 
 vah mere netaa hai, or vah mere liye hameshaa vahi rahenge
 
 
 But why was worthless
 
 
 ?"speculations & suspicions about my absence in rg's Mumbai rallies are meaningless
 Due to an important family function i was very busy whole day, rather till late night
 Had informed him in advance
 He is my leader & he will always be the same for me
 But why was Nikamma absent ?congress ke purv saansad ne pichley saptaah hi elaan kiya tha ki vah 21 oktober ko hone ja rahe maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prachaar nahin karenge, or yah bhi spasht kar diya tha ki vah unke sujhaaye pratyaashiyon ko nahin chune jane se naaraaz hai
 Even then, Sanjay Nirupam said in the tweet without naming anyone, "it seems, the Congress party is no longer in need of my services
" 
 
 maine vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mumbai main sirf ek naam kii sifarish kii thi
 
 
 Heard that, he too has been rejected
 
 
 jaisaa maine netritv ko bataaya tha, aisa kiye jane par main chunaav prachaar main shirkat nahin karuunga
 
 
 This is my last decision
 
 
 "loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hi milind devda ko sanjay nirupam ke sthaan par mumbai congress kaa pramukh banaaya gaya tha
 Milind Deora also resigned after a bitter defeat by the Congress
 party mumbai kii chah siton main se ek par bhi jeet hasil karne main naakaam rahi thi
 Rahul Gandhi also resigned from the post of party president after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, and after searching for a non-gandhi party president as desired by Rahul Gandhi for several months, the party finally got an interim from his mother Sonia Gandhi
 Urged to become chairman
 sonia gandhi ne hi 19 saal tak party adhyaksh pad par rahane ke baad varsh 2017 main rahul ko party kaa sheersh pad saunpa tha
 The disarray in the party has been exposed once again after several months of general elections due to the absence of both the prominent faces of Maharashtra Congress from Rahul Gandhi's rallies
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis tathaa bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke anya netaa prachaar abhiyaan main rahul gandhi ke shaamil nahin hone ko lekar sawaal uthaate rahe hai, or kehete rahe hai ki congress ne chunaav se pehle hi haar maan lee he

 In September 2017, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Trade Facilitation Center at Bada Lalpur at a cost of Rs 200 crore, the 'good days' of the weavers came
 us vakt pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, 'is centre se chote-chote bunakar bhaaiyon ke liye vaishvik bazaar ke raste khul jaaenge
 Through this, the whole world will be introduced to the skills of Kashi
 ' sawaal uthta he kareeb dedh saal baad kya bunakaron kii kismat khuli?banaras main madanpur ke nivasee bunakar faijal sahid kehete hai, 'achche din aae magar bunakaron ke nahin balki kuch rasookh vaale vyapaariyon ke
 By selling saris from weavers and selling them at a higher price, these people deliver saris to Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi and abroad, but the weavers get the same price that was received 5 years ago
 ' faijal ise or vistaar se bataate hai, handloom kii ek sari banane main chaar-paanch din lagate hai
 At least two people are involved in making sarees
 isamen kareeb 6,000 kaa kharch aata he
 The merchant gets this saree for Rs 8,000
 main bunakar se kharidta he or vah ise kam se kam 15,000 ru
 Sells to large traders outside of Banaras
 phir yahi sari or bade vyapaaree ke paas pahunchati he
 Its price has so far increased to 25–28 thousand rupees
 ho jaati he
 Faizal says, at the time of opening the trade center, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had talked about improving the condition of small weavers
 unke hunar ko vishwapatal par pahunchane kii baat kahi thi
 Skill is reaching lekin hunar kaa daam vyapaariyon ko nahin mil rahaa he
 Maiharunishan, who lives in Kabir Chowk, says, “I and my husband visited the trade center last year with saris made of both hand and powerloom
 hamen laga koi rasta batayega ki kaise ham apni saadiyon ke achche daam paa sakate hai? kaise bichauliye ke bina apni saadiyon ko duniyabar main bech sakate hai? lekin vahaan to koi salaah centre hi nahin he
 We were told that an exhibition can be held here, but that too can only be done through a businessman
 'faijal kehete hai, agar vyapaar ko badhaane ke liye mudra lone lene jaao to bina kisi netaa kii sifarish ke yah lone nahin miltaa
 No small weavers within Banaras got any loans, which they got belonged to the merchant class
 kya kehete hai trade centre ke adhikari?bunakaron ke is aarope par trade facilitation centre main kaaleen prashikshak adhikari pradeep yadav kehete hai, 'hamaare yahaan 82 dukaane hai
 Out of these, there are 36 temporary shops (for six months) and 15 government departments like Gujarat Handicraft and Handloom Department, Khadi Gramodyog Shops
 11 dukaane sthaayee (paanch saal ke liye lij par lee gayi ) dukaane hai
 17 shops are yet to be allocated
 ek aam bunakar ko iskaa phayda kaise mil saktaa he? is sawaal ke jawaab main ve kehete hai, haal hi main apravasi samaaroh ke dauraan pradarshnee lagi
 People from all over the world came here
 banaras kii kaarigari or shilp ko duniyabar ke logon ne dekha to isse bunakaron ke hunar ko log janenge
 If a weaver wants to take place in the exhibition, how can it be taken? In response to this question, he says, 'we give place to 50 per cent concession to the exhibitors
 aage yah sansthaaen bunakaron ko chunati hai
 Pradeep Yadav expressed ignorance when asked how the institutions selected the weavers for the exhibition
 pradeep yadav yah bhi kehete hai ki abhi log yahaan dukaane lene main jhijakte hai
 Due to this 17 shops are lying vacant and 36 shops are temporary
 khaas baat yah he ki yah 36 dukaanon kaa asthaayee aavanton apravasi diwas se kuch din pehle hi kiya gaya, lekin dhire-dhire log iske phaayde janenge
 However, on this clarification of Pradeep Yadav, local journalists say that this trade center is activated only after the event or the arrival of Narendra Modi, the rest remains in such a state
 trade facilitation centre ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'dekhie jab kisi kaam kii shuruyaat hoti he to uskaa rigelt aane main samay lagata he, darasal centre kaa laabh uthaane ke liye kam hi bunakar aate hai
 This is probably due to being away from the main area
 ' kuchhek bunakar yahaan aae or yahaan dukaane shuru kin, lekin phir munafa kam hone kii vajah se ve yahaan se chale gaye
 He says, we made several efforts to attract more and more tourists here
 kai bade hotel maalikon ke saath baithak bhi kii gai, lekin main ilaake se dur hone kii vajah se paryatak yahaan aane se jhijakte hai
 Hotel owners and agents demand a commission to bring tourists here
 iskaa bajet hamaare paas nahin he
 Overall, the Trade Center, created to change the fortunes of weavers in the Parliamentary seat of the Prime Minister, is presently unable to bring good days to the common weavers
 haalanki trade centre ke adhikariyon main bhavishya ko lekar utsaah or ummid donon abhi baaki hai
 What was the motive? · Promotion, marketing, branding and export of Handloom, Handicraft, Carpet, Brocade and Khadi products from Varanasi were to be done from the Trade Center
 ·is centre ke jariye karigar or bunakar production ke liye kaccha maal, takneekee, prabandhan aadi suvidhaayen di jaani thim
 The center was also to connect the global market for quality products of weavers and artisans
 · centre par kshetreey udyogon ko behatar karne or antarrashtriya str par spardhaa laayak banane ke liye shodh centre bhi bananaa tha
 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar has always set a high example of his commitment and despite retiring, he is not taking the exhibition cricket match too lightly

 Replying to Ravi Shastri's questions in the Mumbai Indians' match against Sunrisers Hyderabad during the seventh edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Sachin Tendulkar said, "I had to practice at least two months to prepare for that match would need
 
 
 mujhe pataa karnaa hoga ki mere balle kaa madhya bhaag kahaan he
 
 
 '' jab ravi shastri ne ipel main mumbai ke ab tak ke kharaab pradarshan ko lekar sachin tendulkar se poocha ki kya dagout se match dekhte hue vah ek baar phir maidan par utarane ko betaab hai, tendulkar ne iskaa jawaab 'nahin' main diya, haalanki unhone kaha ki mumbai ke ballebaajon ko adhik patibaddhta ke saath ballebaaji kerani hogi
 He said, "our batsmen need to score runs, because it boosts the confidence of the players sitting in the dugout
 
 
 '' The doors of the two dhams have been opened, while the doors of Kedarnath and Badrinath are yet to open, but a letter sent to the Garhwal commissioner of the Home Department has certainly drawn the lines of concern, stating that at the time of opening the doors
 What are the problems and how will they be dealt with
 haalanki sarkari chitthee main ye jarur likhaa he ki sabhi vibhaag uttarakhand ke aapasi talmail ke saath is yatra ko sampann karavaaen
 But what is the end of this letter of the Yatra, has the Uttarakhand government not made all the preparations before? It has been speaking from the minister to Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on this Chardham Yatra
 desh ke pradhanmantri kii nazaren bhi is chardhaam yatra kii taiyaariyon par lagi hui hai, phir aise menuttarakhand sarkaarake grih vibhaag se jari is chitthee kaa aakhir matlab hi kya he, agar is chitti ke har point ko dhyaan se dekha jaae to chardhaam yatra par aane vaale yatrion kii museebataan kam nahin balki badhati hui dikhaai dengi
 All weather road can become a big problem
 In the letter of the Home Department, it is clearly written that how taxi operators and hoteliers collect manga fare from passengers, how the unwanted passengers of the far flung Chardham Yatra due to continuous lack of buses He has to spend his days in Rishikesh or Haridwar, apart from this the Home Department has also warned that the work of All Weather Road is going on continuously
 Area hills of shifting or is likely to grow even problems of landslides
 agar ye sab pehle se hiuttarakhand sarkaarko maaloom he to phir abhi tak iskaa samaadhaan kyon nahin ho paaya he
 Government bus not on the operators? Where it is believed by the government that there is not only a shortage in parking arrangements, but the operators also run arbitrary, they take off any passengers from the middle road
 jisase yatriyon ko tamaam asuvidhaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 The main matter of concern is that the letter mentions the problems arising to the passengers, but there is no mention of a permanent solution to these problems

 film kaa naam : coffee vid dediarector: vishaal mishrastar cast: sunil grover, anjana sukhaani , pankaj treepathi, jakir hossain , deepanita sharma , rajesh sharmivadhi: 2 ghanta 03 minutesrtificate: u / akai dinon se film 'coffee vid di' ko anderworld se aa rahi dhamkee ke bare main khabaren aa rahi thi, vishaal sharma ke diarection main tivi kii duniya ke bahucharchit chehre sunil grover, jinhen aap gutthi yaa doctor mashhoor gulati ke naam se jaanate hai, wo is film main mukhya bhoomika main hai
 By the way, Sunil has also worked in many Hindi films before, such as 'gabbar is Back', 'pyaar To Hona Hi Tha', 'ghajini', 'heropanti' etc
 vahiin diarector vishaal mishra ne isse pehle 3 short films diarect kii thi or abhi coffee vid di ke baad 2 or filmein relies hone ke liye taiyaar hai
 Let's review the film 'coffee with D' at the moment
 film rivyuh bas oke oke he aditya-shraddha kii 'oke janu'kahani:yah mumbai main besd news ankar arnab ghosh (sunil grover) kii kahani he jo ek news chanelle main prime time sho ko host karata he lekin sho kii tiarapy girte rahane kii vajah se uske bos roy (rajesh sharma) ne use 2 maheene kaa vakt diya he kii kuch bhi karke arnab sho kii tiarapy ko upar uthaaye nahin to use non prime time sho par shift kar diya jayega
 In this worry, Arnab's wife (anjana Sukhani) gives him the idea of an interview with underworld don 'D' (zakir Hussain), which Arnab tells his boss and he says yes
 ab kahani main kai twist or terns aate hai or aakhirkaar arnab apni team ke saath don kaa intervyuu karne pahunch jaataa he
 You will know what happens next only after watching the film
 anderworld kii dhamkee ke baad 'gutthi' kii film kii relies talikamjor kadiyaan:film kii soch to acchhee he kii ek news ankar tiarapy kii khatir anderworld don kaa intervyuu lene chalaa jaataa he lekin is puure screenple ko sateek likh paane main riter naakaam rahe hai, jisaki vajah se filmakan main wo baat saamne nikalakar nahin aa paati he
 While watching the film, the censor of many words has also been scissored and dubbing of some places has not been done properly, due to which the story seems quite incomplete and strange
 film main kahin naa kahin bajet kii kami thi jisaki vajah se production vailu kaaphi halki or kamjor dikhaai padati he
 The music of the film is fine but you cannot connect to those songs during their filming
 film kii kahani bahut hi kamjor he jis par bahut sara kaam kiya janaa chahie tha
 Despite the all-star actors like Zakir Hussain, Sunil Grover, Pankaj Tripathi and Rajesh Sharma in the casting of the film, you are unable to connect with it and disappointment is at hand
 Film Review: 'haramkhor' thodi fanphul or thodaa karti he borbox offis :vaise marketing or promoshan kaa kharch milakar film kaa bajet lagbhag saadhe paanch karod bataaya ja rahaa he or film ke mujeec or satelit ritis pehle se hi bik chuke hai, lihaaja film apane production cost kii bharpai to kar legi, ab dekhnaa ye dilachasp hoga kii is film ko munafa kitna hota he

 Doing well in one does not mean performing well in the other

 jiske mutabik punjab main sabhi nijee or sarkari vishvavidhyalay or college tambaakoo mukt honge
 According to the sources, Mahajan has asked the heads of these educational institutions in a written message to strictly follow the COTPA (cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003)

 - input IANS In a lecture organized on the constitution in the Lok Sabha Library on the topic of 'division of power between the organs of the state', Jaitley said that through the interpretation of the constitution, you can give it a possible meaning, which is different from the language, towards some purpose

 Parliament can only impose taxes, that too is the right of the Lok Sabha because only the directly elected house can decide on the money bill

 Parliament is also a part of the basic structure of the Constitution
 karypalika ke kaamkaaj ko adaalatein apane haath main nahin le sakati

 worldcup kaa quarter final stage bharat or bangladesh ko aise mukaam par le aayaa he, jahaan se rasta aage bhi jaataa he or peeche bhi laut aata he
 That is, one team will make its way to the semi-finals and the other to home
 abhi tak is world cap main ek bhi match naa haarane vaali team india melbern main apni jeet ko lekar aashwast to he, lekin bangladesh ke khilaaf world cap kaa itihaas use is match ko halke main lene kii ijaajat nahin de rahaa
 In the 2011 World Cup, India beat Bangladesh on its own ground, but the pain of being eliminated from the World Cup after losing to Bangladesh on the neutral venue (west Indies) in 2007 still haunts Team India
 is worldcup main england jaisi team par jeet ke baad bangladesh ne ek baar phir se khatre kii ghanti baja di he
 Once again the knockout stage of the World Cup is in front, once again the contest is on the neutral venue and once again the World Cup is at stake
 kya hoga is mukaable main khaas aaiye daalate hai ek nazar
 In the figures, a total of 28 international matches have been played between Team India Avalabharat and Bangladesh so far, of which 24 have been won by India and 3 in Bangladesh have also been uncontested
 neutral venue par donon timen 6 baar aapas main bhidi hai, jinamein se 5 baar bharat vijeta rahaa or 1 baar bangladesh
 This was a defeat India got in the World Cup 2007
 world cap muqablon kii baat karen, to donon timen 2 baar aamane-saamne huin or donon ek-ek baar vijeta raheen
 India do not compete in knock out matches Whenever India reached the knock out stage during any major tournament of ICC, they have shown their best game
 aankade kehete hai ki world cap, champions trophy or world tii-20 championships ke dauraan jab bhi bharat ko nock out muqabla khelnaa padaa, bharat ne 3 main se 2 maichon main jeet darj kii he
 Overall, India played 24 such matches, out of which it has won 16 times, lost 6 times and 2 times the match did not result
 udhar, bangladesh ajtak kabhi bhi nokout daur tak pahunchaa hi nahin
 With current form India, India won all their 6 matches in the league round
 lig daur main bhartiya ballebaajon ne 53
 He scored at an average of 48 runs per wicket, which was the best average in the league stage
 is dauraan bhartiya ballebaazon ne 6 shatkeey saajhedaariyaan bhi nibhaain
 Sri Lanka were named more than 7 century partners
 is worldcup main apni virdohi team ko har match main ol out karne kaa karnama karne vaali iklauti team bhi bharat kii hi rahi
 Not only this, Indian bowlers have an economy rate of 4 in their pool
 72 kaa rahaa, joki sarvshereshth tha
 Team India bowlers 20 for each wicket in the league round
 52 ran kharch kiye joki apane pool kii baaki tiimon ke mukaable sabase kam tha
 India was also at the top of its pool in terms of maximum 19 maiden overs
 lig stage main virdohi team ke sabase zyaada khilaadiyon ko ran out karne ke maamle main or sabase zyada kaich lene ke maamle main bhi team india sabase aage rahi
 All the batsmen of Team India, except Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja, are in form
 shikhar dhawan, viraat kohli, suresh raina, mahendra singh dhoni, ajinkya rahane kisi naa kisi match main team india ko jeet ke daravaaje tak lekar gaye, lekin rohit sharma or ravindra jadeja ne zyaadaatar maichon main niraash hi kiya
 Rohit Sharma's flop show as an opener is troubling Team India, so Jadeja has scored only 18 runs in 6 matches
 phir bhi team india ballebaaji ko is match se pehle apni takat maan sakati he
 Team India's batsmen's record against Bangladesh is also excellent
 duusari ore viraat or raina donon kaa bangladesh ke khilaaf ausat or strike rate 100 se upar he
 However, the Bangladesh batsmen have also made a big bang in the league round
 mahamudullah 5 pariyon main 86 ke ausat se 344 ran bana chuke hai, jisamen unke 2 shatak bhi shaamil hai
 Apart from them, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan and Sabir Rahman are also batting vigorously for their team
 gendbaaj bolenge hallaais worldcup main team india or bangladesh donon hi ke gendbaajon ne apni-apni team ke liye jeet darj kii hai
 Mohammad Shami has taken 15 wickets from 5 matches for India, while Ashwin has got 12 wickets from 6 matches
 mohit sharma or umesh yadav bhi 6 maichon main 10-10 shikaar kar chuke hai
 On the other hand, the trio of Shakib al-hasan, Rubel Hussain and Kattan Mashrafe Mortaza are also troubling the opposing batsmen for Bangladesh
 england ke khilaaf to bangladeshi gendbaajon ne kahar barapa diya tha
 Although the Melbourne pitch continues to support the fast bowlers more, but the bounce on the pitch certainly has something for the spinners
 records bhi honge daanv parakptain ke taur par mahendra singh dhoni ke liye ye match behad khaas hoga
 If India beats Bangladesh, it will be captain Dhoni's 100th ODI win
 riki ponting (165 jeet) or alan border (107 jeet) ke baad aisa karne vaale wo tisare captain honge
 This match is also very special for Bangladesh
 ye unka 300waan van-de international match hoga
 Bangladesh won against India in their 100th international match in 2004 and against the West Indies in their 200th international match in 2009
 bangladesh ke captain mashrafe murtaja ko bhi is match kaa intjaar he
 Mashrafe Mortaza was part of the Bangladesh team in the three matches that Bangladesh have won against India

 She says that she is sad that she was once a good friend, but now due to Tanisha, their friendship has broken
 ve yah bhi kahati hai ki jab se ve tanisha ke kareeb aae hai, usee samay se ve unke or kamya ke prati alag rukh rakhane lage the

 unhen jis tarah project kiya ja rahaa tha, vah unhen pasand nahin aa rahaa tha
 So they decided to keep the distance
 pratyusha armaan ko bataati hai ki ve bataur ek insaan bhi kaaphi badal gaye hai, armaan yah kehete hai ki ve kuch samay ke liye akelaa rahanaa chaahate hai
 Pratyusha talks to Kamya about the conversation with Armaan

 But it seems that Armaan is willing to stake all his relations for Tanisha's sake
