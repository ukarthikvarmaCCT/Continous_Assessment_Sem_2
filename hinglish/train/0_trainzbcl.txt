 The Supreme Court on Tuesday canceled the Center's decision to grant reservation under the OBC quota to Jats
 court ne apane faisle main kaha ki centre kaa faisla dashakon puraane aankadon par aadhaarit he or aarakshan ke liye pichhadepan kaa aadhaar saamaajik hona chahie, na ki aarthik yaa shaikshanik
 The court said that the government should bring new backward groups like Trans Gender under OBC
 kuch isi tarah kii baat haryana ke purv congressi mukhyamantribhupinder singh hooda ne bhi kahi he
 Hooda said that the government should file a review petition before the Supreme Court, as the NDA also supported it
 gauratlab he ki hooda or choudhary virendra singh kabhi congress main saath-saath the, lekin virendra singh pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon se thik pehle congress se naata todakar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the
 The Supreme Court in its judgment said that the decision of the Center is based on decades old data and the basis of backwardness for reservation should be social and not economic or educational
 court ne kaha ki sarkaar ko trans gender jaise nae pichde group ko obisi ke tahat laana chahie
 The court said that although caste is a major factor, it cannot be the sole factor for determining backwardness and inclusion of politically organized castes like Jats in the OBC list is not correct for other backward classes
 supreme court ne obisi panel ke us nishkarsh par dhyaan nahin dene ke centre ke faisle main khami pai, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki jat pichhadi jati nahin he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court, under its order, included transgender in the third category and gave them reservation in OBC quota
 obisi raksha samiti kii is yachika par ye faisla aayaa
 Advocate Ombir Singh, appearing for the Supreme Court on behalf of the petitioner Ram Singh, said that this is a historic decision and he welcomes the decision
 jabaki jat aarakshan samiti ke adhyaksh karnal opi sindhu ne is faisle par niraashaa jaahir kii he
 He said that in this case, he has been fighting for many years and this fight will continue
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki wo is faisle par punarvichaar yachika daakhil karenge or jarurat padane par andolan bhi chhedenge
 In March last year, the then Manmohan Singh government included the Jats of nine states in the OBC list
 iske aadhaar par jat bhi naukari or ucch shiksha main obisi varg ko milane vaale 27 fisadi aarakshan ke haqadaar ban gaye the
 Several petitions were filed against this in the Supreme Court
 maujuuda narendra modi sarkaar ne bhi jaaton ko obisi aarakshan kii suvidha die jane ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya he
 The Jats of Rajasthan (bharatpur and Dhaulpur) were included in the central list in addition to Delhi, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Haryana in this decision taken on 4 March 2014 before the Lok Sabha elections
 obisi raksha samiti samet kai sanghathanon ne kaha tha ki obisi kamishan ye kah chukaa he ki jat saamaajik or shaikshanik taur par pichde nahin hai jabaki sarkaar siesaiaar kii report kaa hawala detii rahi he
 The total bad account (NPA) of the banking sector has reached over eight lakh crore
 isse chintit bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) ne un bainkon ke saath thodi sakhti dikhaane kaa faisla kiya he jo bakaayaa karjon ke lambit maamalon ke nibatare main susti dikhaa rahe hai
 RBI has set a time limit for handling such cases
 12 farvari ko usne bainkon ko nirdesh diya ki 2,000 karod ru
 Cases related to npas or more will have to be resolved within six months
 chah maheene main vasuuli nahin hone par bainkon ko in maamalon ko anivaary rup se rashtriya company kanoon nyaayaadhikaran (ensielti) main bhejnaa hoga taaki karjadaar ko diwalia ghoshit karne kii prakriya shuru kii ja sake
 RBI directed banks to share the data related to high risk loans and certain embezzlers on a weekly basis with rbi's database
 100 karod ru
 2,000 crores from Rs
 tak ke karjon ke nibatare kii samay seemaa do varsh kii hogi
 The Reserve Bank has withdrawn the existing resolution framework and also terminated the Joint Lending Forum (JLF)
 jeelef karj muhaiyaa karne vaale bainkon kaa samooh he jiskaa gathan 100 karod ru
 This was done to speed up the decision-making process in the event of any debt of NPA or above (when the borrower becomes unable to repay it)
 visheshgy bataate hai ki arabiai ke is kadam se aane vaali timahi main bainkon ke ghoshit enpie main khaasi badhat dekhi ja sakati he
 Kartik Srinivasan, group head of the financial sector rating agency ICRA, says: "the move by the Reserve Bank is going to increase the worth of both creditors and debtors in the short term
" phir bhi iske doorgaami parinaam sukhad honge kyonki isse bainkon kii sadabahaar karj baantne kii pravriti main kami aegi jisase bankig kshetra kii sehat acchhee bani rahegi
 "by sharing evergreen debt, they mean loans that the banks give to any debtor in debt to repay their old debt
" nae mandandon ke anusaar, sabhi karjadaataaon ko kharaab karj se jude maamalon, jisamen iske nibatare kii samay seemaa bhi he, ke nibatare se judi niti ko apane board se anumodith karaane ke baad saamne rakhana hoga
 In June last year, the RBI had made a list of 12 such borrowers on top of which the banks had Rs 5,000 crore
 yaa usase adhik kaa bakaayaa he or us karj ke evaj main deewaala or diwaliyapan samhita (ibisi) 2016 ke praavdhaanon ke tahat dendaaron ko diwalia ghoshit karne kii prakriya shuru kara di thi
 After this, a second list of 28 borrowers was also released in August out of which 25 cases were sent to NCLT for further action
 jo khabaren mili hai, unke mutabik 1
 28 lakh crores Rs
 ke karj se sambandhit diwaliyapan ke 451 maamle adaalaton main lambit hai
 Some big borrowers like Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel and ABG Shipyard have been hit by the auction
 shrinivasana kehete hai, ''bainkon ke kul enpie kaa kareeb ek-tihaai to sirf 40 bade khaaton main hi he
 With the reduction of the debt settlement limit to 2,000 crores, more and more debt settlement will start at a rapid pace
 '' kareeb 50 aise bade karjadaar hai jinaki bainkon par 2,000 karod ru
 Or more than that and they have to settle this debt by September 1 this year

 # lessonlearned — Edward Snowden (@snowden) October 1, 2015 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik 2017 main dakshin-pashchim monsoon kaa aankada lagaataar duusare saal saamaanya hone ja rahaa he
 Despite this monsoon data is very important for the Kharif crop in the country, farmers in the country are not going to get any relief from it
 aisa isliye ki saamaanya monsoon ke baavjood kisaanon ko adhik paidaavaar kii guarantee nahin mil rahi kyonki jin ilaakon main monsoon se kharif paidaavaar par asar padataa vahaan record hui barish saamaanya se behad kam darj hui he
 Estimates of impaired kharif production even on normal monsoon
 The Central Agriculture Department has increased the kharif crop production in 2017 as compared to the previous year
 8 fisadi kii kami darj hone kaa anumaan jataayaa he
 According to the agriculture department, the kharif production is estimated to be 135 million tonnes in 2017-18 while the kharif production in 2016-17 stood at 139 million tonnes
 krishi vibhaag ke anumaan ke mutabik 2017-18 ke dauraan kharif dhan (chaaval) utpaadan 94
 48 million tons
 jabaki beete varsh dhan utpaadan 96

 haalanki beete paanch saal ke ausat main 2017 main dhan utpaadan 2
 It is estimated to be 59 million tonnes more
 ise bhi padhein: maafee se marz na ban jaae kisaanon kaa karj, bevajaah chintit nahin hai bankvahin 2017-18 main mote anaaj kaa utpaadan 31
 It is estimated to be 49 million tonnes
 jabaki 2016-17 main mote anaaj kaa utpaadan 32
 71 million tons
 isi tarah anya kharif fasal makka kaa is saal utpaadan 0
 52 million tonnes reduced to 18
 73 million ton rahane kaa anumaan he
 Pulses production 8 in the 2017 kharif season according to the Ministry of Agriculture
 71 million ton rahane kaa anumaan he jabaki 2016 main yah 9
 Was 42 million tons
 vahiin beete varsh 22
 20 in 2017, compared to 40 million tonnes of oilseed production
 68 million ton rahane kaa anumaan he
 Apart from these, cotton and jute yields in Kharif crops are also expected to be lower this year than in 2016
 haalanki is saal kharif fasalon main mahaj ganna utpaadan main raahat milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he
 According to the estimates of the Department of Agriculture, in 2017 the total sugarcane production could be 338 tonnes as compared to only 307 million tonnes in 2016
 kyon bigadaa kharif utpaadan kaa anumaanamausam vibhaag ke aankadon par krishi vibhaag kaa kahana he ki kharif fasal ke liye ahm dakshin-pashchim monsoon is baar saamaanya rahane ke baavjood acchhee paidaavaar nahin de paaegaa
 For this, there is no responsible rainfall during the monsoon in areas where there is a large area of sowing of kharif crops
 gauratlab he ki krishi vibhaag fasalon ke utpaadan kaa 5 charnon main apana anumaan jari karti he or abhi jari yah anumaan is shrankhla kaa pehla anumaan he
 Agricultural experts believe that in the next estimates, the Ministry of Agriculture may revise its figures downwards, which is expected to reduce kharif yields further
 aankadon main yah sudhaar desh bhar main asantulit monsooni barish or baadh or sookhe se tabah hua fasalon ke aankalan ke baad kam hone kaa anumaan he
 Also read: Not everyone, only needy farmers should have their debt forgiven: NABARD is noteworthy that the four-month-long journey from Kerala on June 1, the southwest monsoon, is in its final stages
 aankadon ke mutabik june main desh ke adhikansh hisson main acchhee barish hui jiske chalate kisaanon kaa hausala buland tha or deshbhar main jamkar kharif sizan main buaai kii gai
 After this, the monsoon remained normal even during July and the area under kharif sowing recorded a further increase
 lekin agast or sitambar ke dauraan monsoon kam hone ke saath-saath kuch hi ilaakon main saamaanya se adhik barish darj hui auki kisaanon ke niraashaa hi haath lagi
 This monsoon has caused widespread damage to Kharif crops due to floods in Assam, Bihar, foothills of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, southern Chhattisgarh, parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan
 purvi uttar pradesh ke dakshini hisson, pashchimi uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, maharashtra ke vidarbha or marathavada kshetra, punjab va haryana main saamaanya se kam barish darj hui he jiske chalate kharif fasal par vipareet asar padaa he
 Former captain Dilip Tirkey, who described the Indian hockey team as a strong contender for a medal in the Asian Games to be held in China next month, said that the head coach Jose Brasa has added a tone to the team to give consistently good results at the international level
 The psychologist is in dire need
 tirki ne kaha, ‘team ko khel manovaigyanik hi nahin dietician kii bhi sakht jarurat he
 For consistent good performance, it is necessary to emphasize mental strength which only sports psychologists can do
 jeet ke baad ati aatmavishvaas kaa shikaar hone or recovery par dhyaan dene kaa kaam bhi usee kaa hoga
 The Spanish coach of the Indian team, who was runner-up in the Commonwealth Games, emphasized this need
 captain raajapaal singh kaa haalanki maananaa tha ki team ko aise kisi visheshgy kii jarurat nahin he
 Appreciating India's performance at the Commonwealth Games, Tirkey said it raised the possibility of a medal in the Asiad to be held in China next month
 bharat kii diwaar kahe jane vaale is anbhavi dephender ne kaha, ‘jis tarah se team aakraamak haaki khel rahi he, mujhe lagata he ki ham asiad main padak jeetenge
 For this, however, more work needs to be done on defense and penalty corners
 ’ bhartiya team doha asian khel 2006 main pool bi main korea or china ke baad tisare sthaan par rahane ke kaaran semifinal main nahin pahunch saki thi
 Tirkey scored four goals in the tournament for the seventh-ranked Indian team
 tirki ne dephendaron ko tips dete hue kaha, ‘hamen tacling or marking par dhyaan dena chaiye
 Losing eight goals against Australia in the final is a matter of concern
 puri team feet he to itane gol kyon ganvaa rahe hai
 It has to be paid attention to
 dephence main bikharaav ko rokna jaruri he
 Demanding the inclusion of veteran forward Prabhjot Singh and defender Ignace Tirkey in the squad for the Asiad, he said that these are true on coach Brasa's strategy and his experience cannot be dismissed
 unhone kaha, ‘brasa kaa sabstitution par jor rahata he or is ranneeti main igness or prabhjot khare utarate hai
 Both have a lot of experience that cannot be ignored
 ’ vishwa cap or rashtramandal khelon main bharat ke haathon haar kaa badla asiad main chuktaa karne kii pakistani haaki team kii chetavanee ke bare main tirki ne kaha ki takneekee taur par bhartiya team kahin behatar he
 He said, 'it is not that India has defeated Pakistan because of playing on its soil

 Emotions, sensations and energy exploded during the India Today Literature Anniversary Creation Festival held at Ravindra Bhawan, Bhopal on March 29, 2019
 ghazal kii aabru maane jane vaale, desh ke mashhoor shaayar wasim barelvi, diggaj vyangyakaron or kavyitriyon ke saath sangeet ke sur ek saath saje
 The initial session of Rachna Utsav was buzzed with ghazals and nazams of andaz-e-bayan Wasim Barelvi
 india today ke sampadak anshuman tiwari bich-bich main unase samaaj, raajnneeti samet anek muddon par khulkar charchaa kii
 In response, he recited ghazals in Tarannum several times, which was the essence of the sweet and sour experiences of his life
 wasim barelvi ne shuruyaat karte hue farmaaya, ''shaayari or kavita puure jivan kii sadhana he
 Mushayars and poets gatherings come in many colors
 main iskaa 57-58 saal se gavaah hum
 But in such a gathering, such a gathering, in which every face has a whole story inside it, which has literature, study, i will try to present before me the same compositions which shine more in your eyes than clap
 
 " aaj ke rajnatik maahaul par unke kuch sher thejameen to jaisi he waisi hi rahati he lekin, jameen baantne vaale badalte rahete hai;main ek nadi kii tarah bah rahaa hum sadiyon se, agar thahar gaya to jhil ho jaataa;wo ek boond jo failaav main samandar thi, ulajh kar rah gai mitti ke chand jarron main;is jamaane kaa bada kaise banuun, itnaa chhotaapan mere bas kaa nahin
 The ghazal that encapsulates the sentiment of a conscientious person to live up to the expectations and expectations of another, the poet narrated in Tarannum: How to hide what is evident from your face, how to appear according to your will; The picture of decorating the house is very much later, first it should be decided how to save this house; If lakhs of swords get enlarged towards the neck, how can we bow down if i do not know how to bow my head
 kaarykram main naujavaanon kii acchhee-khaasi maujuudagi kii ore tiwari ke ishaara karne par wasim barelvi ne apane kuch nae sher pesh kieh javaan najaron pe kab ungali uthaanaa bhul jate hai, puraane log hai apana jamaana bhul jate hai; koi tuuti-si kashti hi baghawat par utar aae, to kuch din ko ye tufaan sar uthaanaa bhul jate hai
 The next lion of this ghazal had something like this on mutual quarrel: those who do not get free time by colliding among themselves, forget the leaves of those branches
 unhone aaj ke maahaul main badhati un pravritiyon kii ore bhi ishaara kiya, jisamen har koi jindagi kuch yun jeena chaah rahaa he, jahaan kisi ko kisi se koi matlab hi nahin
 This much scattering is not handled by me, i am not put on youtube
 Feet are addicted to wounds, so even thorns are not removed from me; Then whatever i want to return, i have no compassion for the land, i am not even spared that much; Because of which i am afraid that i can do the counterattack, i am not put on my hands like this; May it be a night of love, be with you on the roof, then the moon is not put in between me; i talk about changing the times, my own house is not handled by me
 wasim barelvi ramakatha gayak morari baapu ke bhi pasandida shaayaron main hai
 When his attention was drawn to this aspect, he called this saint as a 'savage of Hindustaniyat'
 unhone apana ek purana mashhoor sher bhi sunayah tuje paane kii koshish main kuch itnaa kho chukaa hum main, ki ab tu mil bhi jaae to tere milane kaa gam hoga
 Wasim Barelvi also told many lions on the lie
 lagbhag ek ghante se zyada chale is satr main unhone shrotaaon ko puure samay baandhe rakhaa or khub daad batori
 The second season was satire with Gyan Chaturvedi, Shantilal Jain and Anuj Khare Mukhtib
 khare ne shuruyaat karte hue bataaya ki mobile kis tarah se hamaari jindagi kaa hissaa ban gaya he or kis tarah se ham uske bagaiyr ek minute bhi nahin rah paa rahe hai
 Now data is more important than son
 kis tarah se is jamaane main logon kii khwahishen bhi badal gai hai
 At first they wanted to get something else, but now their life's purpose has become something else
 is nae jamaane par tanj kasate hue khare ke shabd the, ''aajkal aadmi online he, lekin inasaaniyat ofline ho rahi he
 "now it was the turn of Shantilal Jain
 jain bahut samvedansheeltaa ke saath vyangy likhte he
 In one of his lessons, he made a difference between poor and resourceful people by talking about some simple curiosities about sitting on the plane and traveling in it
 vyangy main unhone us netaa kii pidaa bataai jisane chaar bacchon ke baad family planning kar lee thi
 Now he felt that fewer children were born because the coalition has got more seats in the elections
 satr ke ant main mashhoor vyangyakaar gyaan chaturvedi ne paath kiya
 There was no laughter in his work but rather the questions hidden in him shook the audience
 unki raay thi ki sampradayik hinsa par ham baat karnaa kam pasand karte hai, lekin hinsa karne se nahin darate
 He pointed out the communal violence and raised many questions
 unka sawaal tha, ''kya dange ishwar kii anumati se hote hai, hamane dangon kaa headquarter bhagwaan ke ghar ko kyun banaaya he? or bhagwaan he kiski taraf? aadmi kii taraf? hindu kii taraf yaa musalmaan kii taraf?" unke sawaalon ne logon ko sochane par majaboor kar diya
 He made people emotional by giving a poignant portrayal of the riots
 kavita paath ke rup main teesraa satr tha kavita samay
 In it, active in Hindi poetry, present two young poets of Madhya Pradesh, Babusha Kohli and Anna Madhuri Tirkey, read their new works
 tirki multah chhattisgarh ke janajaatiy parivesh se aati hai lekin lambey arase ve madhya pradesh main hai
 In his poems, caste feeling of tribal society, duality and anguish emerging from living in the city were all present
 unke shabd or paath ke saath chehre par maujuud bhaavon se bhi us tanaav ko kaaphi kuch padhaa ja saktaa tha
 Babusha was also defining poetry in her poems
 stri vimarsh main jaae bagaiyr unhone striyon kii pidaa ko bhi sanjidagi se rekhaankit kiya
 The second part of Rachna Utsav was started by poetess Anamika Ambar in Geet Sandhya
 unhone apane geeton main vyangy baanon kaa bhi khub istemaal kiya
 Sometimes the sea rises even within the river, the stone of honor diamond is awake; My God is your Allah
 
 
 maalik ek he sabakaa, meharbaani ho uski to mukaddar jaag uthta he
 The provocative text of his poem was appreciated by the audience
 pulavama hamale par likhe anamika ke geet sena tera karam
 
 todakar sab bharam, ghar main ghuskar ke maaraa majaa aa gaya
 
 
 Also got shingles

 The performance of Bhojpuri, Chaiti, Kajari, Gari songs entertained the audience
 apni prastuti dene ke pehle megha ne rachana utsav ke manch par india today kaa shukriya adaa karte hue kaha, ''india today se hamaara gaharaa purana naata he
 There was not much education in my house, but still used to come to India Today house
 " india today rachana utsav ke manch par apni prastuti ko is lokapriy gayika ne apane liye ahm kshan mana
 Megha sang the game song of Jharkhand after Mahadeva
 unki agali prastuti raja kurti silavaado multani, batan chaandi kaa laga do ne gaanv kii khushboo bikher di
 He introduced some new old songs including the song Aye Mere Humsafar in the appearance of Medley
 megha ne khadi samadhaniya karke singaar, fagunwaan main rang ras ras barase
 
 
 Apart from this, a hundred year old song was also introduced
 megha ke gane kii urja itani hoti he ki koi bhi shrota susti se nahin baith saktaa
 The tinkle of his voice will pull you towards him
 kaarykram khatm hone kaa samay ho gaya tha lekin megha ankhen band karke ek ke baad ek gane gaae ja rahi thim, jaise kahin kho gai hon, haal aa gaya ho unhen
 Even after six hours at Rachna Utsav, the enthusiasm of the people remained
 ek gayak kii kamyaabi kii isse badi nishaani bhala or kya ho sakati he!sahitya varshiki rachana utsav ke manch par sampadak anshuman tiwari ne aayojan ke makasad par prakaash daalate hue kaha ki sahitya varshiki padhuya hi nahin, kuch aise manch bhi hone chahie jahaan par ham sahitya kii rachanaatmakataa ko uski puri urja main prastut kar saken
 "if a poem can ask a question, only a poem can answer it

 apane is apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye sati ke pita raja prajapati daksh ne bhi ek yajna kaa aayojan kiya
 Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and other gods and goddesses were invited to that yagna, but they did not deliberately send the invitation of this yajna to their gathering Lord Shiva
 bhagwaan shiv is yajna main shaamil nahin hue or jab naarad ji se sati ko pataa chalaa ki unke pita ke yahaan yajna ho rahaa he lekin unhen nimantrit nahin kiya gaya he
 She became angry knowing this
 naarad ne unhen salaah di ki pita ke yahaan jane ke liye bulaave kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 When Sati started going to her father's house, Lord Shiva explained to her but she did not listen, so Lord herself refused to go
 Navratri 2018: navaratri ke shubh dinon main in baton kaa rakhen khyalshankar ji ke rokane par bhi jid kar sati yajna main shaamil hone chali gayi
 At the place of sacrifice, Sati asked her father Daksha the reason for not inviting Shankar ji and expressed fierce opposition to her father
 is par daksh, bhagwaan shankar ke bare main sati ke saamne hi apmanjanak baaten karne lage
 Suffering this insult, Sati jumped into the sacrificial fire and gave her life
 Navratri 2018: kalash sthapana kii vidhi, shubh muhoort, niyam or saavdhaaniyanbhagwan shankar ko jab yah pataa chalaa to krodh se unka teesraa netra khul gaya
 There was catastrophe and chaos in the universe
 shiv ji ke aadesh par virbhadra ne daksh kaa sir kaat diya or anya devataaon ko shiv ninda sunne kii bhi sajaa di
 Lord Shankar took out the body of Sati from the Yajnakund and lifted it on the shoulder and grieved and started roaming all over the planet
 navaratri main bhuulakar bhi naa karen ye kaam, maa durga ho jaati hai naarajabhagwati sati ne shivaji ko darshan die or kaha ki jis-jis sthaan par unke sharir ke ang alag hokar girenge, vahaan mahashaktipeeth kaa udai hoga
 With the corpse of Sati, Shiva also started wandering on the earth doing Tandava, which caused a situation of catastrophe on the earth
 prithvi samet teenon lokon ko vyakul dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu apane sudarshan chakra se sati ke sharir ko khand-khand kar dharti par giraate gaye
 Whenever Shiva slammed into the dance posture, Vishnu would cut off any part of the mother's body from its cycle and drop its pieces on the earth
 shastron ke anusaar is prakaar jahaan-jahaan sati ke ang ke tukade, unke vastra yaa aabhushan gire, vahaan-vahaan shaktipeeth kaa udai hua
 In this way, Shaktipeeths of Mother were built in 51 places
 agle janm main sati ne raja himalay ke ghar parvati ke rup main janm liya or ghor tapasya kar shiv ko pun: pati rup main praapt kiya

 unhone ashanka jataai ki isse bangladesh se aakar rah rahe avaidh hindu pravaasiyon ko vaidhata mil jaaegi or mul nivaasiyon ke sansadhano ke liye khatra paidaa hoga
 Assam was the center of this protest
 maahaul bhaanpakar, bhaajapa ne rajyasabha main vidheyak pesh nahin kiya jisase yah nirast ho gaya or naaraaz gathbandhan sahyogi phir se bhaajapa ke saath aa gaye
 In Assam, the BJP, along with its allies Assam Gana Parishad and Bodoland People's Front, ensured the polarization of Hindu and tribal votes while Muslim votes in three Muslim-majority seats were split between the All India United Democratic Front and the Congress

 The perception in the Northeast is reinforcing that the central government under Modi's leadership has focused on the development of the Northeast and has drawn the attention of the country to these eight states

 The government has declared it a money bill
 aise main rajyasabha sanshodhan paarit bhi kar den to bhi sarkaar kii marji kaa bill jo loksabhaa se paas kiya he, vahi paas mana jayega
 On this, Yechury responded to Narahul that even if the government can do it in the name of money bill, we should clear the public opinion by passing amendments in Rajya Sabha
 bhale hi baad main sarkaar loksabhaa main usko bheje or wo sanshodhan mani bill ke naam par bematlab ho jaae
 During the meeting, Rahul and Sitaram Yechuryen took coffee and sandwiches for breakfast, then in Bengal, how the Congress has been making sandwiches between Mamata and CPM in the last years

 ' As we are born, we get involved in many relationships, but friendship is a relationship that we choose for ourselves
 dost achche mil jaaen to jindagi kii bahut si mushkilen aasaan ho jaati hai
 According to a study, people who have good friends live long lives
 aise log paristhitiyon ko behatar tareeke se sambhalate hai or positive bane rahete hai
 While good friends make life easier, if the friends are not good then the odds of life increases
 aise main bahut jaruri he ki aapako doston kii pahchaan karne aati ho
 If you are going to befriend someone, then first check it and if it is something, then make a distance from it immediately because it turns out to be a good friend, it is unlikely
 aise logon ko dost banane se pehle sochen jarur
 
 
 1
 jo sirf apni chalaate hon
 
 
 There should be friends who support you
 aise nahin jo bos kii tarah vyavhaar karen
 You have a disadvantage in making friends who trust only in running their own

 Who insults on talk 
 
 doston ke bich hansi-majaak hote rahete hai lekin agar koi shaks baat-baat par aapako apamaanit karata he to, wo aapkaa dost nahin ho saktaa

 Let us know for which 5 reasons the development in Jharkhand became malnourished even before it was born
 
 
 1
 Political instability: Political instability has caused the most damage to Jharkhand
 rajya kii sthapana ke 17 saal main kul 13 sarkarein or 6 siem hue hai
 At the same time, 8 cms have come up in Uttarakhand and 2 cms in Chhattisgarh
 jahaan chhattisgarh main adhiktar bijepi kaa shashan rahaa he, vahiin uttarakhand main taj bijepi or congress ke bich badalata rahaa he
 Political instability was not seen more in these two states than in Jharkhand
 vartmaan siem raghubar das ne khud tajposhi ke dauraan kaha tha ki vahjharkhandake pehle siem hai, jinke paas bahumat kii sarkaar he
 Raghubar Das told Aaj Tak, "political instability is the main reason for Jharkhand's economic backwardness
 ''haalanki jharkhand main ab ummid jaagi he, kyonki dilli or ranchi, donon hi jagah ek hi party (bijepi) kii bahumat vaali sarkarein hai
 Raghubar Das has said that due to this, the economic growth of Jharkhand will accelerate in future
 2
 Jharkhand is a unique state in itself
 jahaan isane desh ko pehla nirdaleey mukhyamantri diya, vahiin usee siem par lage ghotaalon ke aaropon ne record brake kar diya
 Former Chief Minister Madhu Kodaki was arrested in the mining and coal scam
 pichley 17 saalon main kai ghotaalon ne rajya ko vikaas ke maamle main peeche dhakela
 This is the reason that Jharkhand is far behind in all matters of education, health, employment
 bhrashtachar or raajnneetik asthirataa kaa sabase zyada asar menuphaccharing or khanan kshetra par padaa he
 At the time of the birth of the state, it was known as a manufacturing and mining center
 yahaan kii jidipi par gaur karen to seva kshetra main ijapha menuphaccharing kii keemat par aayaa he, jo 2004-05 ke 34 fisadi se girakar 2013-14 main keval 20 fisadi par aa chukaa he
 During this period, the share of the services sector increased by 12 percent, while that of the manufacturing sector decreased by 14 percent
 vahiin 13 saal main jharkhand lok seva ayog ne sirf paanch parikshaayen lee hai
 Three examinations are under investigation in that too
 3
 If the impact of Naxalism is felt by the state government and the central government, then Jharkhand suffered the most from Naxalism
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki naksaliyon ke kabje or hamalon kii vajah se aam aadmi ko laabh pahunchane vaali adhiktar sarkari yojanaayen kargar dhang se lagu nahin ho sakin
 Apart from the deteriorating industrial environment due to Naxalism, many big projects have been lagging behind for years or are hanging
 vahiin aankadon ke anusaar jharkhand jab bana tab rajya ke 14 jile naksal prabhavit the
 The number of such districts has now increased to 18
 haalanki bich ke kuch saalon main yah 21 tak pahunch gai thi, lekin centre sarkaar ke dabaav or suraksha balon kii karrwai ke baad kuch jagahon se naksaliyon kaa safaya hua he
 4
 shaharikaran kii raftaar dhimiek saath janme teenon rajyon jharkhand, uttarakhand or chhattisgarh kii tulana karen to beete 17 saalon main jharkhand main shaharikaran kii raftaar sabase dhimi rahi
 While urban area was around 22 percent in Jharkhand in 2000, 26 in Uttarakhand and only 20 percent in Chhattisgarh
 2011 tak aate-aate uttarakhand main shahari kshetra badhkar 30
 Urban area in Chhattisgarh 23 with a rise of 3 percent to 55 percent
 24 pratishat tak pahunch gaya
 However, Jharkhand saw an increase of only 2 percent in urban areas and currently it is 24
 05 pratishat he
 Many experts also associate urbanization with development
 vahiin aisa tab he jab jharkhand main khanij sampada akut bhari hui he or yahaan audyogikaran kii kaaphi sambhaavnaaen maujuud hai
 At the same time, compared to the already developed city of Jamshedpur, the pace of development has been seen in Deoghar and other backward cities
 5
 No money for farming, no food grains are called, the building is as strong as its foundation
 jharkhand kii baat karen to isaki neenv hi kaaphi kamjor he
 47 of Jharkhand as per National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) 2015-16 report
 8 fisadi bachche kuposhit hai
 The survey has revealed that about four lakh of these children are very malnourished
 kai reporton main jharkhand main bacchon va mahilaon kii swasthya sambandhi dayaneey sthiti kii pushti ho chuki he
 Recently, in Simdega district of Jharkhand, there was news of a heart-wrenching death of a starving girl due to not getting ration due to not having an Aadhaar card
 aise main koi rajya kaise vikaas kar saktaa he
 At the same time, Chief Minister Raghubar Das has also admitted that malnutrition is a big problem of Jharkhand
 unhone apil kii he ki sabhi jimmedaar log or sanghathan sarkaar kii madad karen, taaki varsh 2022 tak jharkhand ko garibi or kuposhan se hameshaa ke liye mukt kiya ja sake
 Most of the tribal community in Jharkhand earn their livelihood through agriculture
 jharkhand main garibi dar bhale hi 45 pratishat se ghatakar 37 pratishat ke kareeb pahunch gaya ho, jharkhand ke logon kii saamaajik-aarthik haalat dayaneey he
 In July this year, due to debt and crop losses, the news of the suicide of 7 farmers came within a month
 exparts ke mutabik jharkhand ke kisaan paramparaagat tareekon se kheti karke pehle khush the, lekin badale samay ke anusaar sinchai suvidha kaa abhaav or khaad, beej ke liye karj lenaa pad rahaa he
 Due to crop failure, farmers are unable to repay this debt
 sarkaar bhi kisaanon kii madad nahin kar rahi he
 In such a situation, farmers in Jharkhand are getting badly affected
 aise main agar vikaas karnaa he to sarkaar ke liye sheersh paanch praathamiktaayen honi chahie—shiksha, swasthya, krishi, khanan or vinirmaan kshetra kii bahaali or pehle se ubhar rahe seva kshetra ko protsaahan dena, taaki vah or teji se vruddhi kar sake
 With the penetration of 4G and 3G in the country, the number of Internet users will reach 600 million by 2020

 Resignation, then the oath of CM and on Friday Nitish Kumar also secured a trust vote in the assembly
 isi ke saath tay ho gaya ki ab ve jediu-bijepi ke saath bihar kii sarkaar chalaayenge
 Nitish, who returned to the NDA again after leaving Lalu Yadav's party, may have to face political turmoil later
 par baat vikaas kii karen to unke paas shandaar mauka he
 There are many reasons that Nitish Kumar, once known as Good Governance Babu, can take this economically backward state far ahead
 ye 5 aise kaaran, jo badal sakate hai bihar kii tasviir1
 Hope to reach the package- How will Modi's development dream help? After forming the government at the center in 2014, Narendra Modi and BJP tried their best to win Bihar in 2015
 par nitish-lalu ke saath aane se aisa ho nahin paaya
 But the final goal of forming a government in Bihar was achieved in 2017 itself
 aise main modi ne jo bihar se vikaas kaa vaada kiya tha, ab unhen puraa karne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Nitish Kumar's first term in Bihar with the BJP was superb
 sadak or bijli par unhone acha kaam kiya tha
 In such a situation, if the Modi government now supports Bihar, then the picture of the state can change
 modi ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan 125,000 karod dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 Let me tell you that it was revealed in an RTI recently that the government has not yet released any funds from this announcement

 Look East: More focus on backward, bjp's biggest policy! BJP is focusing on big states under Look East Police after UP
 bijepi kisi bhi keemat par aane vaale dinon main east ke rajyon- bengal, bihar main apni pakad majboot rakhni chaahati he
 It can help, Nitish Kumar's rule in Bihar
 modi apane bayanon main kai baar is baat kaa zikr kar chuke hai ki desh ke pashchimi rajyon kii tarah ve purvi rajyon ko bhi vikaas kii gaadi par baithaana chaahate hai
 In such a situation, if some work is done seriously on this side, Bihar will be the biggest and first beneficiary under Nitish Kumar's leadership

 Equality in delhi-bihar - After 19 years, this coincidence is happening after 19 years that there is a single party or coalition government in Bihar and Delhi

 Their emphasis has also been on development
 pehla kaarykaal iskaa udhaaharan rahaa he
 Due to this, cases like kidnapping, murder in Bihar called Jungle Raj were also reduced
 raajnneetik uthapatak ke kaaran nitish khud kii khai jameen talashne kii koshish karenge, aise main vikaas ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa bada vikalp nahin hoga

 majboot vipaksh- tejasvi kaa role bhi badhegacha nitish kumaar ke saath bhale hi lalu ke duusare bete tejasvi ko satta chalaane kaa tarika aayaa ho yaa nahin par unke paas majboot vipaksh kaa role play karne kaa mauka he

 Following an intelligence, the airbase and the surrounding area are being searched
 sutron ke mutabik airbase or pathankot ke aasapaas ke kisi military base par aatanki atake hone kii soochna he
 The attack took place last year
 In January last year, the Pathankot Air Force Station was attacked by terrorists armed with huge amount of ammo

 All the terrorists were also killed in this attack
 'achde din' kii sankalpana ke saath jab narendra modi ne desh ke 'pradhan sevak' kaa pad sambhala to laga jaise 10 saal ke baad loktantr kaa jaagran hua he
 a majority government was formed and everyone started chanting that 'good days have come'
 darasal, yah lajimi bhi he kyonki chunavi bigul bajane ke saath hi bijepi ne bhi isi mantra ko aadhaar banaakar vot batore the
 But now the exam is also with the NDA government
 100 din puure ho gaye hai or janata ke bich jaakar india today group va hansaa research ne desh kaa mizaaj jaanane kii koshish kii
 According to the latest survey, 51 percent people have considered PM Modi's work to be good
 aankada bhale hi 51 fisad kaa ho, lekin varanasi se lekar dilli tak or arunachal se lekar kashmir tak karodon aashaaen centre sarkaar ke sir kaa taj hai
 The arithmetic of the data shows that 28 percent people consider Modi's performance as average, while 10 percent rate it as very good and 06 percent very poor
 narendra modi ke sattashin hote hi badhati mahangaai, rail haada main badhotaree or seemaa par pakistan kii gustaakhee ne centre kii pareshaani badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 Obviously, the mood of the public has come keeping these things in mind
 baharhaal, 29 rajyon ke 108 loksabhaa kshetron ke kiye gaye is taaja survey kii baat karen to 23 fisad logon kaa mat he ki vikaas kii raah main modi kii pehali praathamikta garibi he
 22 per cent believe that corruption is a big issue for Modi, while 18 per cent considers inflation and 9 per cent women safety as the priority of the Modi government
 musalamaanon kii surakshanarendra modi kii sarkaar par congress samet tamaam vipakshi dalon ne sampradayik hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 It was also said that the riots have increased as soon as the government is formed, the public is not safe
 lekin india today-hansaa research ke survey main ise sire se khaarij kar diya gaya he
 76 percent of the people believe that the public is safe in the Modi government
 iske saath hi 61 fisad log un sambhaavnaaon ko khaarij karte hai jiske mutabik modi raaj main hindu rashtrawaad ko badhaava mila he
 Modi is identified with development In the first two weeks of August (3 to 14 August 2014), in this survey, 46 percent people have believed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is identified with development
 24 fisad log sushasan ko modi kii pahchaan maanate hai, jabaki 9 fisad hindu rashtrawaad or 4 fisad sampradayikta ko narendra modi kii pahchaan bataate hai
 RSS vs Modi's thinking Narendra Modi is considered close to the Sangh
 aise main yah sawaal hameshaa se rahaa he ki kya pradhanmantri modi sangh ke ishaare par chalenge yaa phir desh ko apni soch ke saath aage badhayenge
 Out of 12,430 people surveyed, 47 percent believe that Modi will go ahead with his thinking and take decisions instead of RSS
 haalanki 12 fisad yah bhi maanate hai ki modi sangh ke ishaaron par chalenge
 How is Modi's cabinet survey People have shown enthusiasm about Modi's cabinet
 78 fisad logon kaa mat he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii cabinet acchhee he or vah achche faisle legi, jabaki 9 fisad logon ne modi kii cabinet se niraashaa jaahir kii he
 So after 100 days we have the work of the government in front of us and on this basis also the public opinion
 pradhanmantri narendra modi japan se nai saugaton or apekshaaon ke saath waapas laut aae hai
 Apparently sitting in the motor of majority, the Modi government has a long journey of development in the next 5 years
 loktantr kii sadak saji hui he or ye 100 din ek acchhee shuruyaat kii aahat bhi dete hai
 The wait is also about the report card that Narendra Modi had discussed in his first speech at the temple of democracy, because then the government will be able to assess the integrity of the government

 com / 30wbhwe2ff— Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn)february 6, 2019 Public Accounts Committee Chairman Murli Manohar Joshi on Thursday said that while rejecting the suggestion of Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) Chairman PC Chacko to go beyond the purview of the PAC in its 2G case and avoid a drag on the subject
 Anything but the PAC has the constitutional right to examine the expenditure of public funds
 joshi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, jepisi or piesi ke adhikaar spasht hai
 In the 2G case, the PAC has been investigating since the time the JPC was not constituted or introduced in the CAG report
 unhone kaha ki jepisi ko 1998 se 2009 tak spectrum se judi niti or iske anupaalan main vibhinn sarkaron kii ore se barti gai khaamiyon kii jaanch kar niyat samaysima main report pesh karne ko kaha gaya he
 Whereas the PAC has the statutory and constitutional right to investigate the subject matter and financial irregularities related to the expenditure of public funds
 samaanaantar jaanch se bachane ke chaako aagrah ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, koi kuch bhi chaah saktaa he lekin ham aisa nahin maanate
 We have the constitutional right to investigate this matter
 yah puche jane par ki piesi kii ore se pradhanmantri ko bulaane kaa maamla kya thande baste main chalaa gaya, joshi ne kaha, hamaare yahaan koi bhi vishay thande baste main nahin jaataa or na hi samaapt hota he
 This will definitely happen if the committee wishes to reach consensus
 yah puche jane par ki kya radia tepe se jude kuch khaas patrakaron ko nahin bulaane kaa piesi par dabaav he, joshi ne kaha, hamaare upar koi dabaav nahin he
 This will be done when the committee considers the need to call
 gauratlab he ki 2 ji spectrum maamle main lok lekha samiti :piesi: dwaara vibhinn paksh ke logon se poochtacha kiye jane se naakhush navgathit jepisi ke adhyaksh chaako ne kuch din pehle kaha tha ki piesi apane daayre se baahar gai he or is vishay main khinchataan se bachaa janaa chahie
 Earlier, refusing to give weight to Chacko's remarks, PAC President Joshi had said that Chacko should give his suggestion in writing
 is par, chaako ne kaha tha, shaayad vah :joshi: bhi ise samajhate hai
 So they did not deny what i said
 unhone keval itnaa kaha ki mujhe is bare main likhit main apni baat rakhni chahie
 Whereas, Joshi had said, Chacko is a senior and mature leader
 agar unke paas koi suzav he yaa unhen piesi ke bare main kuch kahana he to acha hoga ki vah hamen iske bare main likhen

 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party has ruled out any possibility of any alliance with the Congress or the BJP if there is a hung assembly after the elections
 'aap' ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne is babat twit kiya he ki lagata he ki shila dikshit apni haar maan chuki hai
 Sheila Dixit is losing the election on her own seat, Kejriwal will give a tremendous knockout: Sheila Dixit first appeared in a press conference held at Sheila Dixit's residence on Sunday, but after the election, she was seen as being in tune with the Aam Aadmi Party

 The Bombay High Court has given minor relief to those who feared action by Income Tax authorities
 darasal, bombai hoicourt ne kendriya pratyaksh kar board (sibiditi) ke ek aadesh ko radd kar diya he
 Under this order, the income tax authorities were under pressure to act indirectly
 sibiditi ne beete saal 'kendriya karrwai yojana' (siapi) ke tahat ek aadesh jari kiya tha
 The order stated that the assessment of the annual performance of the Central Appellate Income Tax Officers in the year 2018-19 would depend on the quality orders placed by them
 udhaaharan ke liye iskar adhikari ne 2018-19 main tex peyars par jurmaana lagaayenge yaa phir taxperes ke tex assesament se jude faisle lenge unka pradarshan utana hi behatar mana jayega
 But a petition was filed in the Bombay High Court against this decision of CBDT
 isi yachika par sunwaayee karte hue bombai hoicourt ne sibiditi ke aadesh ko khaarij kar diya
 The judgment was delivered by a bench of High Court Justice Akeel Qureshi and Justice Sarang Kotwal
 yah janhit yachika chembar aaf tex kansaltent kii ore se hitesh doshi ke alaava vidhi company esalegal kii ore se daayar kii gai thi
 The petitioners had challenged the new system of performance appraisal of officers prepared by the CBDT
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki is tarah ke lakshyon or samaysima tay kiye jane se iskar ayuktaon par kar maamalon ko jaldbaaji main tay karne kaa dabaav badhegaa
 This will not lead to a fair hearing on the taxpayer's case
 bataa den ki siapi main adhikariyon dwaara prayek maamle main aadesh paarit karne kaa samay bhi tay kiya gaya he
 The High Court in its judgment has described this policy as completely unacceptable and illegal

 The local court in Delhi ordered the people of Bihar to register an FIR against Raj Thackeray for calling him an 'infiltrator' of Mumbai

 Sharma had filed a petition seeking registration of an FIR for making provocative and anti-national speeches on Thackeray
 yachikakarta ne aarope lagaaya ki 31 agast ko mumbai main die apane bhaashan main raaj ne mumbai main bihar ke logon ko ghuspaithiya kaha or unhen maharashtra se bhagane kii dhamkee di
 Earlier, the Delhi Police, presenting an action report in the court, said that there were many legal hurdles in registering a case against Raj on the statement that people of Bihar were called as intruders
 police ne kaha ki na to yah bayaan dilli main diya gaya tha or na hi kisi samachar patr main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 Where the BJP government is demonizing demonetisation
 vahiin, congress kaa kahana he ki isse garib or amir kaa faasla badha he
 In such a way, how can we tell it near
 notebandi kaa kisaanon par hue asar ko samajhane ke liye ajtak conklev notebandi paas yaa fail ke ahm satr main kendriya mantri mahesh sharma or congress netaa deependra hooda ne shirkat kii
 The session was moderated by India Today Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal
 notebandi ek bada faislamahesh sharmaane kaha ki 2014 main aam janata policy paralisis ke daur se guzar rahi thi lekin bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad logon ko parivartan kaa intjaar tha
 Before the BJP government, people had lost faith in the government machinery
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra par logon ko bharosa tha or ummid thi ki nai sarkaar bade faisle legi
 Modi government took a big decision like demonetisation, which will brighten the future of the people, with the aim of initiating change in the country
 garibon ko hua he nuksaan : hoodacongress netaa deependra hoodane kaha ki arabiai ke mutabik 99 fisadi cash vyavastha main waapas aa chukaa he
 As far as terrorism is concerned, this year Kashmir has seen the most incidents in 10 years
 vahiin notebandi se sarkaar ne vaada kiya tha ki amir ko nuksaan hoga or garibon ko phayda pahonchega lekin vastav main isse ulta dekhne ko mila
 According to Hooda, the wealth of the rich in the country has been the highest in the last 3 years
 kai shell companiyaan ain samnerahul kanvalane poocha ki aakhir kyon amir or garib main faasla badha he? mahesh sharma ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad 3 lakh shell companiyaan saamne ai hai
 It is time to investigate these companies
 mahesh sharma ke mutabik kalaadhan desh main garibon or kisaanon ke paas nahin tha
 Leaders, officials and businessmen who deposited black money in the bank will no longer be able to escape
 kab ujagar honge shell companiyon se jude tathyahooda ne poocha ki in shell companiyon se jude hue tathy kab tak ujagar honge or kab tak yah paisa aam aadmi ke bank khaaton main jamaa kiya jayega? vahiin rahul kanwal ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad chote kaarobaariyon ke kaarobaari aankade lagbhag 50 fisadi gire hue hai jisase saaf he ki is puri prakriya kaa bura asar in kaarobaaron par padaa he
 Mahesh Sharma said that according to the Reserve Bank, a currency of Rs 1000 was deposited in a bank that was never in circulation and used to go from one vault to another
 ab aisi karency bank main jamaa he
 The problem caused to the farmers by demonetisation
huda claimed that the statement of the Central Government that there was no problem to the farmers due to demonetisation is completely wrong
 lekin hooda ne daawa kiya ki notebandi ke baad jahaan aalu 9 paise kilo or pyaaj 25 paise kilo bechney par kisaan majaboor tha vahiin aaj inaki keemton ko dekhen to saaf pataa chalata he ki notebandi ke baad kisaanon kaa kitna nuksaan hua
 a strange situation arose in front of the temple of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala when it was revealed that people have donated 500 and 1000 rupees notes of four crores in the hundi here here in the last two months
 ye note, notebandi ke baad puraane noton ko badalawaane ke liye tay antim taarikh ke baad daale gaye hai
 An official said that the temple administration has written to the government and the Reserve Bank of India in this regard
 is prasiddh mandir main desh ke vibhinn hisson se aae logon ne chalan se baahar kiye ja chuke note, note badalawaane kii antim taarikh 30 disambar ke baad hundi main daale, thirumalatirupati devsthanamke kaaryakari adhikari di sambashiwa raav ne bataaya ki puraani mudra main chaar karod rupaye se adhik kii raashi chadhaai gai he
 In Davos today, once again Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the people in his national language Hindi
 unhone is vaishvik manch par 'namaskara' se apana sambodhan shuru kiya
 On this platform, Modi emphatically put his words before the world
 unhone vaishvik takaton kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr wo teen mudde uthaae jisase kai bade desh kathghare main khadey ho gaye
 He said that PM Modi warned the world in detail about the three big challenges and three challenges facing the world at this time
 1
 First challenge (climate change) - Climate change is the biggest threat to the world
 gleciars peeche hatate ja rahaa he
 Arctic ice is melting
 bahut se dweep dub rahe hai, yaa doobane vaale hai
 Too hot and too cold, too much rain and drought of floods
 bigadataa mausam kaa prabhaav din-ba-din bad rahaa he
 Everyone says that carbon emissions should be reduced
 lekin aise kitne desh yaa log hai jo vikasshil deshon or samaajon ko upyukt technology uplabdh karaane ke liye aavashyak sansaadhan muhaiyaa karaane main madad karnaa chaahate hai
 Thousands of years ago, in our scriptures, man was described as the son of the land mother
 agar aisa he to maanav or prakruthik ke bich jang kyon chal rahi he
 It was said in the most prominent Upanishads - while living in the world, sacrifice it freely, and do not covet another's property
 dhai hajaar saal pehle aparigrah ko apane siddhanton main ahm sthaan diya
 2
 duusari chunauti (aatankwaad)-is sambandh main bharat kii chintaaon or vishwa bhar main puri maanavtaa ke khatre se aap sab parichit hai
 All governments are familiar
 aatankwaad jitna khatarnaak he, usase bhi khatarnaak good terririst or bed terririst ke banaaya gaya bhed he
 India has been suffering from terrorism for years
 har manch par bharat aatankwaad ke khilaaf duniya ko aagaah karata he
 But when it comes to Good Terrorist and Bad Terrorist, solidarity against terror is hurt
 aaj aatankwaad keval ek desh kii samasya nahin he
 Today everyone needs to see it from a perspective
 3
 The third challenge (autism) - Globalization is shrinking against its name
 main yah dekhtaa hum ki bahut se samaaj or desh zyada se zyada aatmakendrit hote ja rahe hai
 Globalization seems to be shrinking contrary to its name
 is prakaar kii manovritiyaan or galat praathamiktaaon ke dushprinaam ko jalayavu parivartan yaa aatankwaad ke khatre se kam nahin aanka ja saktaa
 Although everyone talks about the interconnected world
 lekin globaligeshan kii chamak ho rahi he
 Yoon is valid, WTO is valid but does it reflect today's system? hanuman ji kii puja karne se sabhi prakaar ke sankat dur ho jate hai
 His devotees become fearless
 unhen kisi prakaar kaa bhay nahin hota
 Hanuman ji can be worshiped by both men and women and also offers both equally to Bajrangbali boons
 lekin pandit vinod mishra ke bataaya ki chuki hanuman ji akhand brahmacharee va mahayogi bhi hai, isliye sabase jaruri he ki unki kisi bhi tarah kii upasna main brahmacharya va indriya sanyam ko apanaaya jaae
 Know what happens with the song Aarti of Shree Hanumanlala
 According to many rules, Pandit Vinod Mishra, although women and men have equal rights to worship Hanuman ji, there are many rules for women
 hanuman ji mahilaon ko mata ke samaan maanate the, isliye koi stri unke saamne jhuke, yah unhen nahin bhaataa
 There are many such tasks in their worship that women cannot perform
 
 
 ye hai hanumanji ke 15 anuthe mandir
 
 
 Women should not do this work in the worship of Hanuman janeu arpit na karen
 2
 apane haathon se sindur na chadhayen
 3
 bajrang baan kaa paath na karen
 4
 hanuman ji ko asana na den
 5
 chola bhi na chadhayen
 Tuesday's fast will be fulfilled by the recitation of Katha 6
 lambey anushthan nahin kar saktin
 7
 rajaswala hone par hanuman ji se sambandhit koi bhi kaary nahin kar saktin
 8
 charanpadukaayen arpit na karen
 9
 panchamrita snaan nahin karana chahie
 10
 kapadon kaa joda samarpit nahin kar saktin

 According to the Public Prosecutor, the incident is from September last year
 baaise march ko madhya pradesh vidhansabha ne sadan ke niyamon main sanshodhan se judaa vah prastaav sthagit kar diya, jo vipaksh se sadan main sawaal poochne ke vidhayakon ke adhikaron par lagaam lagaakar vipaksh ko pangu kar saktaa tha
 The House Rules Committee of the House also has three members of the opposition, yet former Chief Minister Babulal Gaur was successful in placing the proposal of such amendment on the floor of the House on 8 March
 ek bhi vidhayak ne is par aapatti darj nahin karai or yah prastaav 15 march ke liye adhishuchet bhi ho gaya
 Opposition to the opposition started when the media took up the matter
 uske baad 22 march ko vidhansabha adhyaksh sitasharan sharma is vivaadaaspad sanshodhan ko sthagit karne ko vivash hue
 The amendment provided for the abolition of any mla's right to ask questions on a range of issues in the House
 aise maamle jinaki jaanch chal rahi ho, vibhaajankaree shaktiyon ko badhaava dene vaale vishyon, sampradayik jhadpon or aise kisi bhi vishay se sambandhit prashn poochne kaa adhikaar yah sanshodhan samaapt karata he jo viypi suraksha, khaastaur se mukhyamantri kii suraksha se judaa ho
 The new rule also allows ruling party legislators to bring a 'motion of confidence' against the 'no confidence motion' of the opposition
 vipaksh jaise neend se jaagaa or use sanshodhan ke nateezon kaa abhas hua
 After that, the opposition started making a noise of violating the rules and moved a no confidence motion against the Speaker of the Assembly, but by then the Assembly session was over
 is prayaas ko chune gaye jan-pratinidhiyon kii aawaaj kaa galaa ghontne ke ghaatak prayaas ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Analysts believe that the government was thus finding a backdoor route to avoid holding itself accountable
 aksar prashn poochkar apni hi party ko asahaj kar dene vaale malwa kshetra se aane vaale bhartiya janata party ke hi ek vidhayak kehete hai, ''sarkaar jis prashn ko lekar asahaj rahati he to uske liye uskaa bada rata-rataya formula apanaati he—ukt prashn se judi suchanaaen abhi ekatrit kii ja rahi hai
 Whenever the government is uncomfortable with any question, it tries to avoid it

 Can Rajendra Kumar, former chief secretary of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, go to politics by taking VRS i
e
 voluntary retirement from civil service? This question arose because on 4 January Rajendra Kumar wrote a letter to the Chief Secretary of Delhi asking for VRS and alleged that during interrogation, he was constantly pressurized that if he implicated CM Kejriwal, he would be released
 iske baad guuruuvaar subah media ke saamne aakar unhone kaha ki ab sarkaar nahin balki duusare tareekon se ve logon kii seva karnaa jari rakhenge
 In such a situation, NDTV asked that if there is a way to serve people in politics also, would you come into politics, Rajendra Kumar said
 bahut tareeke hote hai public sarvice ke or usamen se raajnneeti bhi ek he, haalanki abhi maine iske liye sochaa nahin he, lekin jo bhi sabase achche tarika hoga logon kii seva karne kaa use main jarur apanaaungaa
 The question goes beyond this and it also arises that if they come into politics, will they join the Aam Aadmi Party? This discussion is in full swing due to Kejriwal's close proximity
 saath main dhyaan rakhane vaali baat yah bhi he ki bahut zaahir he ki agar rajendra kumaar aam aadmi party main aana chahen to party ke darvaaze unke liye khule hai
 The comments kejariwal aaj bhi rajendra kumaar ko ek eemaandaar afasar maanate hai or alam yah he ki beete 6 maheene se jabase rajendra kumaar giraftaar hue tab se lekar aaj tak kisi duusare afasar ko unhone apana sachiv niyukt nahin kiya he, lekin rajendra kumaar kaa aglaa kadam sarkaar se VRS milane ke baad hi tay ho saktaa he kyonki jab tak unki VRS nahin mil jaati tab tak vah ek nilambit afasar hai, jo sarvice ke niyam se bandhaa he
 Rajendra Kumar is considered a close official of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 rajendra kumaar vah pehle afasar the, jinako kejariwal ne pehali baar sarkaar banaate hue apana sachiv niyukt kiya tha
 For the first time in December 2013, after forming the government in Delhi with the support of Congress, Kejriwal chose Rajendra Kumar as his Principal Secretary
 uske baad kejariwal kii sarkaar jane ke baad jab dobaaraa satta main ai tab bhi rajendra kumaar hi unke pradhan sachin bane
 In December 2015, the CBI raided his Delhi Secretariat office and then arrested him in July 2016 for alleged corruption
 rajendra kumaar par adaalat main aarope patr daakhil ho chukaa he or philhal wo nilambit hai or ab unke saamne zyaada vikalp bhi nahin bache hai
 After this, he came in front of the media on Thursday morning and said that now he will continue to serve the people in other ways, not the government
 aise main enditivi ne poocha ki raajnneeti main bhi logon kii seva karne kaa tarika he to kya aap raajnneeti main aaenge to rajendra kumaar bole
 There are many ways of public service and politics is also one of them, though i have not thought about it yet, but whatever will be the best way to serve people, i will definitely adopt it
 sawaal isse aage badhkar yah bhi uthta he ki agar raajnneeti main aate hai to kya vah aam aadmi party kaa daaman thamenge? kejariwal ke kareebi hone ke chalate yah charchaa joro par he
 It is also important to note that if Rajendra Kumar wants to come to the Aam Aadmi Party, then the doors of the party are open for him
 tippaniyan Kejriwal still considers Rajendra Kumar an honest officer and the fact is that since Rajendra Kumar was arrested for the last 6 months, till date he has not appointed any other officer as his secretary, but Rajendra Kumar's next step from the government VRS can be decided only after getting it, because until his VRS is found he is a suspended officer who is bound by the rules of service
 rajendra kumaar dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke kareebi maane adhikari maane jate hai
 Rajendra Kumar He was the first officer whom Kejriwal appointed as his secretary, forming the government for the first time
 pehali baar disambar 2013 main dilli main congress ke samarthan se sarkaar banane ke baad kejariwal ne rajendra kumaar ko apana pradhan sachiv chunaa tha
 After that, when Kejriwal's government came to power again, Rajendra Kumar became his chief Sachin
 disambar 2015 main sibiai ne unke khilaaf kathith bhrashtachar ke maamle main pehle unke dilli sachivalay ke daphtar par chapa maaraa or phir july 2016 main giraftaar karnaa liya tha
 The charge sheet has been filed on Rajendra Kumar in the court and he is currently suspended and now there is not much option left in front of him
 kejariwal aaj bhi rajendra kumaar ko ek eemaandaar afasar maanate hai or alam yah he ki beete 6 maheene se jabase rajendra kumaar giraftaar hue tab se lekar aaj tak kisi duusare afasar ko unhone apana sachiv niyukt nahin kiya he, lekin rajendra kumaar kaa aglaa kadam sarkaar se VRS milane ke baad hi tay ho saktaa he kyonki jab tak unki VRS nahin mil jaati tab tak vah ek nilambit afasar hai, jo sarvice ke niyam se bandhaa he

 15 saal pehle 20 saal kii umr main pati ne gusse main unhen teen baar talaak-talaak-talaak kahkar ghar se nikaal diya tha

 Anything can be sold in the market
 lo sahab! patalkot bhi bik gaya
 In just 11 lakhs, that part of 'patalkot', the unique world of Madhya Pradesh, was sold, where a bird's eye view of this beautiful plaintiff was visible
 bikwaal koi or nahin, vahi tha, jis par bachaae rakhane kii zimmedaari thi
 Nature must have given natural rights to equality to all her children in her development for thousands of years
 rajshahi ke itihaas main bhi taanaashaahon ne aam aadmi ke liye nadi, pahaad, jangal, vaayu jaisi chizon par tex nahin lagaaya, use sarvasulabh banaae rakhaa, bina kisi likhit samvidhan ke
 When the Indians of seventy years ago surrendered the Preamble to the Constitution, then they took great care of the matter of equality, freedom and justice
 lekin udaarikaran ke baad ke keval tisare dashak tak hi puunji ke tandav ne vah tamaasha kiya, jisamen keval apane laabh ke liye sansadhano par kabja, kabje se adhiktam lut
 Loot at any cost
 isaki taaja misaal patalkot kaa vah hissaa he, jise kisi or ne nahin, sarkaar ne ek company ko saahasik gatividhiyon ke naam par diya
 The company also started a 'profit making factory' by planting a garden of its occupation there
 vah to bhala ho madhya pradesh kii janata kaa, jisane sarkaar badal di
 Well, the newspaper 'patrika', which itself raised the issue
 or bhala ho congress sarkaar or mukhyamantri kaa, jinhone is maamle par sangyaan le liya
 Otherwise, we have seen many examples of pledging of heritage after gaining the strength of majority, we have seen the practice of selling Shivnath river to a company few years back in Chhattisgarh
 baari virodh ke chalate vah nahin ho paaya, lekin yah is sansadhano ko puunji ke hawaale kar daalane ke litmus test zarur hai
 If you do not speak, do not protest, you will be sold
 patalkot par nazar kyon
 
 
 The Hearing the word Patalkot brings to your mind the image of a mysterious world
 iske bare main tarah-tarah kii kahaniyaan hai
 Listen, sunlight does not reach here, people still live like primitive human beings
 yah chhindwara jile ke tamiya vikaskhand kaa ilaaka he
 The Bhariya tribals live here predominantly
 primitive tribal group arthath aadim janajati samooh yani PTG
 According to the census 2011, the total population here is 3,820 in twelve inhabited villages
 yah ilaaka 79 varg kilometre main failaa hua he
 It is 2,750 to 3,250 feet above sea level
 satapura ke pathaar par chhindwara se uttar main 62 kilometre or tamiya vikaskhand mukhyalay se 23 kilometre kii duuri par sthit he
 Surrounded by high hills on three sides, this area is deprived of adequate means of transport
 patalkot ke kisi bhi gaanv main jane ke liye 1,200 se 1,500 foot neeche utarana padataa he
 Its geographical location makes it bizarre, but at the same time there is the life of 3,000 people, which we have been considering as life outside the mainstream
 yah alag baat he ki un logon ke liye unki mukhyadhara to vahi he, kyonki vah usee main khush the, unki zarurat kaa unako vahiin mil hi jaaya karata tha or yah bahut puraani baat nahin he
 Journalist friend Saket Dubey, while researching the Bharia tribe, drew information that Sarala Devi Rai, the research officer of the Tata Institute, wrote in 1960-61 that there was no malnutrition here for the whole of the '60s and even after
 chintak kapil tiwari ne bhi apane shodh adhyayan se bataaya tha ki janajatiyon main khaadya asuraksha or kuposhan nahin tha
 This case came about as a result of the so-called development of British rule and post-independence in the last one and a half centuries
 in do kathanon ke baraabar se dekhte hai, to vikaas kaa ek aisa cheharaa hamaare saamne aata he, jisane us samudaay kaa to vinaash hi kiya he, jo aise sansadhano par naiysargik rup se tikaa hua he, lekin ham to use pichhadaa hi maanate hai
 
 
 
 or hamaara vikaas jab aise sochane lag jaataa he ki paryaton ke aane se us kshetra kaa bhala ho jayega, us kshetra ke logon ko aajeevika mil jaaegi, tab darasal uske saath anyaay hi ho rahaa hota he
 Patalkot also seems to be becoming an observer of this, are we preparing such view points to see the people of that area as a zoo
 sochane kii baat yah he ki isi patalkot ke paas 18 june, 1978 ko bhaaria vikaas praadhikaran kholaa gaya tha
 Its headquarters was also built in Tamia
 is praadhikaran banane ke 40 saal baad bhaaria samudaay kaa kya kuch ho paaya, kaha nahin ja saktaa
 But it is sure that there are no resources left in Patalakot, nor is there a living for which Patalakot was known
 aapatti paryaton par nahin he
 Demonstration has been happening since the beginning of civilization
 deshaatan main keval manoranjan nahin hota
 There is also spread of education, culture and civilization
 ibnebatuta kii yatra aise hi to yaad nahin rakhi jaati
 How many such places of tourism were discovered through such efforts, which opened the way to the mysterious world for the world
 vah bhimbetka, ajanta-ellora, konark, khajuraho na jane kahaan tak failaa sansar he, lekin jab se is deshaatan ko paryaton ke rup main vishuddh manoranjan ke rup main parivartit kar diya gaya he, tab se isaki chintaa or bad gai he
 Not only that, who should also have the first right to those resources in exchange for tourism, is also another matter of concern
 or yadi unki bali lee bhi ja rahi he, to usko badale main kya or kaise diya jayega, yah bhi tay kiya janaa chahie
 The first right to resources rests with its local people, it should be understood that they are the protectors, not its consumers
 isliye kisi nadi, kisi talab, kisi ped, kisi patalkot par koi company sthaneey logon ke liye pabandi nahin hi laga sakati he

 The Prashanth and Yogendraka faction are using sites like Facebook and Twitter to promote Swaraj Samvad to be organized on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti

 - Input IANS begusarai kii ladaai ko kanhaiya kumaar kii maujuudagi ne ek rashtriya mukaable main badal daalaa he
 Many eminent people from across the country are reaching Begusarai to support and promote Kanhaiya
 inamen JNU ke unke puraane saathi hi nahin, alag-alag pragatisheel andolanon or morchon se jude log bhi shaamil hai
 Overall, the atmosphere is such that Khandi, who did not go for the promotion of Kanhaiya in this period, is not a progressive or social worker
 javed akhtar, shabana aazmi or yogendra yadav jaisi hastiyaan unke samarthan main begusarai pahunchakar prachaar kar chuki hai
 Kanhaiya should also get support, of course
 raajnneeti kii maujuuda sadaandh main vah ek tazaa cheharaa he
 Those who are complaining about his not being a Marxist, they are forgetting that this is not a virtue, but a virtue in Indian democracy
 bhartiya janata aise netaa ko pasand nahin karti he, jisamen paryaapt lacheelaapan na ho
 Of course, this flexibility has its own dangers, but this danger is an inevitable part of parliamentary democracy - if you do not approve of it and you want a direct class struggle or revolution, then this path is not for you
 is raste par ek-duusare ko samajhnaa, apni vichaardhaara ke saath saamaajik vyaavhaarikta ko jodna ek majaburi he
 If Kanhaiya or educated youth like that come in politics, then they should be welcomed
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke anyathaa udhaas or daraavne maahaul main inaki upasthiti ek ummid paidaa karti he
 The same can be said of some more young faces like Jignesh Mevani
 magar begusarai main jo maahaul in dinon bana hua he, vah ek duusare maahaul kii bhi yaad dilaataa he
 When Arvind Kejriwal landed in Varanasi to confront Narendra Modi in 2014, there was an influx of people who supported him from across the country
 maahaul kuch aisa banaaya gaya, jaise kejariwal pradhanmantri ko haraa sakate hai
 When the result came, it was found that Kejriwal had lost by three and a half lakh votes
 begusarai bhi kahin banaras sabit na ho, yah dar bilkul niraadhaar nahin he
 Elections in India are no less than a celebration, but they are fought like a battle
 begusarai main yah ladaai tikoni he
 In Begusarai, Kanhaiya Kumar has to face not just Giriraj Singh, but also Tanveer Hasan, who had garnered more than three and a half lakh votes from 2014, despite a strong candidate like Modi wave and Bhola Singh
 tanwir hasan kaa pradarshan dekhte hue hi RJD gathbandhan ke tamaam dalon ke liye udaartaa dikhaane ke baavjood CPI ke liye yah seat chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hui
 Now the danger is that if Kanhaiya Kumar snatches a lot of Tanveer Hasan's votes, Giriraj Singh who sent everyone to Pakistan will win from there
 kyonki 2014 main BJP ko vahaan jo sava chaar lakh vot mili the, unamem ek bada hissaa un logon kaa he, jo modi or BJP kii raajnneeti ke aakraamak samarthak hai
 Kanhaiya will not be able to make a big dent among them
 duryog se BJP jis nirlajj fasivadi najariye ke saath puri raajnneeti kar rahi he, or media kaa ek bada hissaa jis tarah uskaa saath de rahaa he, uski vajah se kanhaiya bahut saare logon ke liye 'tukade-tukade gang' kaa numaayinda he
 The terminology used for Kanhaiya, or such people, shows how much hatred has been instilled within a large community over its most comfortable citizens and young people
 is ghrinaa ke bich kanhaiya CPI ke ummidavaar hokar to nahin jeet paaenge
 The CPI has one and a half million votes, which Kanhaiya will have to at least triple to win
 phir kanhaiya ke jeetne kaa rasta kya nikalegaa
 
 
 The He can win by being a few Begusarai people, some as a persecuted person at the hands of Delhi to garner the sympathy of his people
 vah apni bhoomihaar pahchaan kaa istemaal kar sakate hai - yaa ve karen yaa na karen, begusarai ke voter to aisa kar hi sakate hai
 If Kanhaiya is not to do all this, then what was the need to fight Begusarai
 
 
 ? agar vah ek rashtriya netaa ke taur par lard rahe hai, agar vah khud ko kisi jatigat, sthaneey pahchaan se pare rakhana chaahate hai, to phir kisi bhi seat se chunaav lard sakate the
 Such a seat would have given them RJD and it would have been easy for them to win
 begusarai agar unhone isliye chunaa he ki vah vahiin ke hai, to vahaan kii sari pahachaanen unhen apane saath lekar hi chunaav ladanaa hoga
 Actually this is the real challenge of Indian democracy
 yahaan aap sirf communist hokar, sirf koi siddhantvaadi hokar chunaav nahin jeet sakate
 You have to live with a lot of your identities and move between people
 bharat ke netaa yahi kaam karte hai, lekin duchitapan yah he ki ise ve sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin hote
 Because they do not have a comfortable relationship with the diversity of India, within this diversity, they want to protect some islands of their identity as their monopoly
 hamaara loktantr apane netaaon se yah apeksha rakhata he ki ve janata ke qareeb rahen, unke bich ke hon
 When this requirement is not met, voters choose their representatives based on their caste and religious identity
 lekin koi netaa aisa ho, jo unako bharosa dilaae ki vah in sab pahachaanon se pare jaakar sabakaa he, to shaayad vah kahin zyaada sweekaarya hoga

 'whatmor ne kaha ki pakistani khilaadiyon ke fitness kaa moolyankan may main srilanka daure par jane se pehle agle saptaah kiya jayega

 Let us tell you that last week, Aam Aadmi Party had left Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira in Punjab and made Harpal Singh Cheema as Leader of Opposition

 As usual, the pair of Shah and Modi have discovered a low profile and honest name, this time also calling political pundits as Dhata
 bijepi ke is master stroke kaa virodh shaayad hi koi kare
 However, the biggest push in the name of Ramnath Kovind would have been the Advani faction because after Modi got the power of the country, it was believed that the next President of the country would be Lal Krishna Advani
 pehle hi bataa diya gaya tha faislaapako bataa den ki ramnath kovind ke naam kii ghoshnaa karne se pehle hi bijepi ne apni manshaa laal krishna adwani or murali manhor joshi ke saamne jaahir kar di thi
 Significantly, these two senior leaders of the BJP were expecting their names
 majboot lamabandi bhi kaam naa ilaal krishna adwani ke liye bijepi or sangh ke tamaam netaa lamaband the
 Everyone tried very hard to be Advani as the next President of the country, but the modi-shah duo turned the water on all the hard work
 twit se lekar poster takahaal hi main laal krishna adwani ko lekar bijepi ke 'shotgan' shatrughan sinha ne kai twit kiye the
 Shatrughan said that there could be no better alternative to Advani than for the presidency
 iske alaava ravivaar ko bijepi karyaalay ke baahar adwani ke paksh main poster bhi lagaae gaye the
 An attempt was made to send a message through the poster that Advani should be declared the next presidential candidate
 to isliye vatting hi rahi adwani kii seat?ramnath kovind bihar ke rajyapal hai
 They have always struggled for the poor, the backward and the Dalits, with poor and Dalit backgrounds
 bihar ke rajyapal hai, upi ke rahane vaale hai bijepi isse kai tarah ke phaayde kii ummid laga rahi hogi
 On one hand, it is seen as Dalit vote bank and on the other hand big states like Bihar and UP which can make the path of return to power in 2019 quite easy
 baharhaal, endie ne apana ummidavaar chun liya he
 Hopefully, the opposition can also give their consent in this name
 haalanki yah sonia gandhi ke netritv main 22 june ko hone vaali vipakshi dalon kii meeting main tay ho jayega
 But, what will be seen now is that once the 'waiting' remains again (advani first PM in waiting and then President in waiting), what will be the attitude of Advani and his supporters
