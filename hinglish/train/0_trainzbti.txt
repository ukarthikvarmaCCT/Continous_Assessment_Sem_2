 The Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) has not left the NDA yet in the midst of rapidly changing political developments in Bihar
 haalanki party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ne seat bantwaare par bijepi ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he or iske liye november tak kaa ultimatum bhi diya
 Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) President Upendra Kushwaha has long been talking about giving respectable seats for seat sharing on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and has not done so many times to quit the NDA
 
 endie main bane rahane kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar aaj shanivaar ko patna main rashtriya lok samta party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak behad ahm maani ja rahi tha jisamen kushvaha ko faisla lenaa tha
 But after the meeting, Kushwaha announced to give BJP some more time
 unhone bijepi ko ultimatum dete hue is maheene ke ant tak seat bantwaare ke maamle ko sulajhane kaa vakt diya
 He said that nothing will be decided by the party on this issue right now
 vah is masale par pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat karne kii koshish karenge
 On the statement made by the Chief Minister of the state, Nitish Kumar, Kushwaha said that he has withdrawn his statement
 28 november ko jyotiba phule ke janmdiwas par oonch-neech virodh diwas manaaya jayega
 According to sources, Kushwaha wants the BJP to give him 3 seats for the Lok Sabha elections, but the BJP is in the mood to give him only 2 seats, about which Kushwaha is very angry
 isi dauraan kushvaha ne khud ko nitish kumaar dwaara kathith taur par 'neech' kahe jane ko lekar bhi mudda banaaya or mukhyamantri ko khari-khoti sunai
 2 mlas formed distance before this, 2 party mlas did not attend the party's national executive meeting

 The departure of Kushwaha will not make any difference: JDU: Before this meeting, JDU state president Vashisht Narayan Singh said that there will be no impact on the alliance if Upendra Kushwaha goes out of NDA
 bihar main NDA gathbandhan kaaphi majboot he or is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki koun gathbandhan main shaamil hota he yaa koun chhodkar jaataa he
 In a few months, there has been an altercation between RLSP and JDU
 upendra kushvaha or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke bich takaraar koi nai nahin he magar haal main kushvaha ne aarope lagaaya ki nitish kumaar ne unhen ek kaarykram ke dauraan kathith taur par ‚Äúneech‚Äù kahkar sambodhit kiya
 Since then, Kushwaha has become very aggressive on him
 pichley maheene bijepi rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne is baat kaa elaan kiya tha ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main jediu or bijepi ek samaan siton par chunaav ladegi
 After this announcement, there was a stir within Upendra Kushwaha's party
 NDA ke ghatak dal lok janashakti party or jediu neupendra kushvaahake dwaara mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hamalavar hone kii ninda kii he
 JDU leaders have even said that whether or not Upendra Kushwaha's party stays in the NDA is not going to make any difference
 jaahir si baat he, upendra kushvaha kii party NDA main puri tareeke se alag-thalag pad gai he
 On Friday too, Upendra Kushwaha tried to talk to Amit Shah in Delhi about seat synergy but he did not get any time
 aise main shanivaar korashtriya lok samta partiki rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak kaaphi mahatvapurn ho gai he
 It is believed that in this meeting Upendra Kushwaha can take a big decision regarding the party's future strategy
 abhi NDA main hum or rahoonga: kushvahaisase pehle kendriya mantri or endie ke sahyogi kushvaha ne 'ajtak' se kaha tha ki vah siton ke bantwaare ko lekar amit shah se milanaa chaahate the lekin unki mulaakaat nahin ho pai
 He also said that he is now in the NDA and will stay
 zyada siten maangane ke sawaal par kushvaha ne kaha ki 'kitni siten hamane maangi thi, yah saarvajanik nahin kar saktaa lekin itnaa jarur kah saktaa hum ki pichhali baar ke mukaable hamaari party kii takat badi he jiske hisaab se hamen siten milani chahie
 The party has a meeting for further strategy

 The main objective of this task force will be to reduce the possibility of confrontation with humans due to the increasing population of lions in the coming time

 More than 150 such cases have also been reported in the last two years
 task force ko khaas muddon par dhyaan dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 In protected areas in the vicinity of Gir, attention will be paid to increase the number of lions, so that the lions do not go into the human settlement and remain in the forest areas only

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president Mayawati on Friday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bispi supremeo ne kaha ki narendra modi ne gathbandhan par jativaadee hone kaa jo aarope lagaaya he, vah haasyaaspad or aparipakv he
 He wrote in another tweet, "modi ji uses casteism openly for political selfishness by forcing himself backward, if he was backward from birth, would RSS ever allow him to become Prime Minister? Mayawati said that anyway Mr
 Kalyan What has the RSS done to Singh like Singh, is this country not seeing it? " gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek jansabha ke dauraan espi-bispi gathbandhan ko 'mahamilavati' qaraar dete hue kaha tha ki in partiyon kaa ek hi mantra he, 'jaat-paat japana, janata kaa maal apana
 After the allegations and counter-allegations of Mayawati and Prime Minister Modi, the issue of caste seems to be at the center of election campaign again
 iske peeche kaaran yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki bihar, upi or jharkhand kii jin siton par chunaav hona baaki he, vahaan jati kaa factor voton ke dhruvikaran main badi bhoomika nibhaataa aayaa he
 The issue of Prime Minister Modi's caste is not new and the debate has been going on
 jaisaa ki 7 may 2014 ko narendra modi ne khud kaha tha, 'bhaaiyo bahanon, ye to itihaas kii sachai he ki main nichi jati main paidaa hua hum lekin main desh ko bharosa detaa hum meri raajnneeti nimna str kii nahin he
 i am born in a low caste but my dream is one India is the best India
 saal 2014 main jab narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri hua karte the tab bijepi ke piem candidet ke rup main pehali baar unhone desh ke saamne pichhadi jati main apni paidaaish kaa khulaasa kiya
 But in the last years more new statements have come out on PM Modi caste, about which PM Modi has recently made the country aware
 pradhanmantri modi ne 27 april ko kannauj main kaha, 'aapke liye pichhadi jati main paidaa hona raajnneeti kaa khel hoga, mere liye pichhadi jati main paidaa hona maa bharti kii seva karne kaa saubhaahgya he or kuch nahin
 And sister, my dear people, my caste is so small, there is not even a single house in the village and i am born backward but not very backward
 ' ye 27 april kaa bhaashan he jo piem modi ne kannauj main diya tha or ati pichhadi jati main paidaa hone ko apana saubhaahgya mana tha lekin mayawati aisa nahin maanatin
 Mayawati said, 'narendra Modi is not an OBC by birth, so he has not faced the brunt of casteism
 aisi mithyaa baaten nahin kerani chahie ki hamaara gathbandhan jati ke naam par vot le rahaa he
 It was not right
 modi jabardastee khud ko pichhadaa bataakar jatvaad kaa istemaal karte rahe hai
 'PM Modi is OBC i
e
 backward caste since birth or after Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, his caste was declared as backward caste, this is the question on which the doubt remains
 piem modi jis modh ghanchi jati se aate hai use kai rajyon main taili yaa sahu bhi kaha jaataa he
 The Modha Ghanchi caste is considered prosperous in Gujarat and earlier this caste was counted among the upper castes
 may 2014 main gujarat sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki modh ghanchi jati ko 1994 main hi obisi category main shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a proof of which the Gujarat government introduced a notification issued on 25 July 1994, through which 36 castes including Modha Ghanchi were included in the OBC category
 matlab ye ki piem modi kii jati ko tab pichhadi jati kaa darja diya ja chukaa tha, jab narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri nahin bane the
 In May 2014, on a circular basis, the Gujarat government alleged that Congress leader Shakti Singh Gohil had manipulated Modi to include his caste in the OBC category after becoming chief minister
 shakti singh gohil ne 9 may 2014 ko kaha tha, 'modi jab paidaa hue tab yaa bade hue tab, kabhi bhi pichhadi jati main nahin the
 Modi is Modh Ghanchi
 vaisya to hai, apper cast to hai lekin bade paise vaale jo parivaar the usamen se aate the
 'that means PM Modi is a backward caste by birth or he has included his caste in the OBC category after becoming the Chief Minister, BJP and Congress have their own claims about this, but Mayawati has another claim too
 jaisaa ki mayawati ne shuukravaar ko kaha, 'agar modi janm se pichde hote to kya RSS unhen pradhanmantri banavaa detaa
 Anyway, what has been done by people like Kalyan Singh, this country knows everything
 'baharhaal, piem kii jati ko lekar chunavi charchaa charam par he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special news letters It was the year of 1996
 england main birmingham ke egebaston maidan par main maujuud tha
 England had won the match by eight wickets
 yah zyada score vaala match nahin tha
 But not only me but many others remembered that match because of the washing of England bowlers by Sachin Tendulkar in the second innings
 us pich par vah chauthi pari thi or tej gendbaajon ko zyada hi madad mil rahi thi, gend betarah gum rahi thi or laharaa rahi thi
 Nevertheless, Sachin single-handedly fired Chris Lewis, who was on fire at the time
 bharat ke kul 219 ranon main 122 akele sachin ne banaae the
 Apart from him, only Sanjay Manjrekar was able to score 18 runs
 aisi kathin pari khilne ke liye jis anushaasan or focus kii darkaar hoti he, use lay or aakraamakata donon ko sadhate hue anjaam nahin diya ja saktaa
 But Sachin has arguably performed both
 ham sabhi yah dekh kar hairaan the ki us kahar dhaati gendbaaji ke akraman se puri nidarta se akele hi jujh rahe the, jabaki duusare chor se unke saathi ballebaaj 'tu chal main aata hum‚Äô kii mudra main maidan chhodte ja rahe the
 i think this courage can show only those who have such technical ability to use one after the other
 yah vahi kar saktaa he jo apni kamajoriyon se pehle do-chaar ho chukaa ho or unki kaat khoj lee ho
 Weaknesses that swallowed many players with relatively less kuvvat
 in beete varshon main main sachin ko itani baar or itane pahaluon se dekh chukaa hum ki ab mere liye yah kah paanaa mushkil ho gaya he ki unki koun-si pari, match yaa pahalu mujhe sabase acha laga
 If i have to give a rough example, i will miss his preparation to take on Shane Warne in an India tour of Australia
 saamaanya samaj to yahi kahegi ki bhartiya ballebaajon ko us samay kaa mizaaj bhaanpakar australian tej gendbaaji kaa muqabla karne ko taiyaar hona chahie lekin doston, saamaanya samaj kai baar dhokhaa de jaati he
 If the pitches are going to help spin bowling, then how is it good to prepare for the match with fast bowling? Sachin was probably the only player in the Indian team to understand this
 so, unhone lakshmana shivaramkrishnan se guzarish kii ki ve unki practice ke liye jaraa round da wicket gend daalen, vah bhi us jagah par jahaan gendbaajon kaa pair padate rahane se ek gaddha-sa ban jaataa he
 What was the result of that, you can see it in the pages of history
 use yahaan dohraane kaa koi phayda nahin
 i remembered that practice session in a way because of the ability of Sachin to think far and wide
 mujhe laga ki dekho, yah kaisaa ballebaaj he! kahaan dhokhaa ho saktaa he, use pehle se hi bhaanpakar yah banda taiyaari karne main laga hua he
 And it is worth noting here that they were not just practicing
 kadi practice to bahut-saare log kiya karte hai
 But practice does not come from mere practice
 har tarah ke halaat ko dhyaan main rakhkar jab tak parfect practice nahin karte, tab tak uskaa koi matlab nahin
 If you are going to practice wrong things, then you will continue to be more capable of doing wrong
 apane lagbhag samooche kariyar main sachin ne yah baat darshai he ki sahi practice ko lekar ve kitne satark rahe hai
 And it has helped them achieve footwork as per their choice
 khilaadi kaa yah footwork hasil kar lenaa kisi bhi coach ko khushi se jhuumane kaa avasar de detaa he
 If you forget his performance of the last one and a half years ‚Äî you should forget because it is a very natural thing ‚Äî then i have never seen him pull out the wrong leg
 apni kala main maharath rakhane vaale kisi nartak kii tarah sachin ne har baar apana shot khilne ke vaaste uske liye ekadam makul mudra apanaai he
 The reason for this is, as i was telling the British Prime Minister David Cameron recently, first of all you need to set your feet
 aapke haath or baanhen to apane aap apni sahi jagah par set ho jate hai
 In the case of Sachin, the importance of footwork increases even more as he is shorter in stature like Sunil Gavaskar
 or chote kad ke ballebaaj aage badhkar khilne ke liye chota kadam badhaate hai
 If your footwork is not right and your feet come out only one and a half feet and you are far away from the pitch of the ball, then the matter can be dangerous for you
 apni jagah par aap jam-se ho jaaenge
 Except for 18 months here, i did not see Sachin with such weak footwork
 ab unke kadamon ne us tarah se move karnaa band kar diya he, or mere hisaab se yahi hona tha
 This is called time only
 he ki nahin?sachin kii takanic kaa doosraa ahm pahalu rahaa he gend kii lambaai pard lene kii unki kaabiliyat
 And i am fond of them for this
 mujhe is baat kaa shaayad utana khulaasa karne kii jarurat nahin lekin hamane dekha he ki kai ballebaaj, jab unhen frontroot par khelnaa hota he to baikfoot par khelte dikhte hai or jab baikfoot par khelnaa hota he to frontput par
 This has been happening continuously
 yahaan tak ki mahendra singh dhoni jaisaa kaabil khilaadi bhi haal hi main west indies ke khilaaf kolkata test main wicketiper ko kaich thama baitha
 The reason? the same
 ve aage nikalne kii bajaae pichley pair par hi date rahe
 You won't find all this happening with Sachin, usually
 is bande main to lambaai kaa andaja laga lene kii gajab kii kaabiliyat he
 And this is what really matters ‚Äî footwork and the length of the ball
 kisi bhi achche ballebaaj ke liye ye buniyadi takanic hai yaa kahen ki honi chahie
 The beauty of Sachin's game has been that he does all this with great ease
 mote taur par ye hi ve vajahen rahi hai, jisase ki ve kisi bhi tarah kii pich par kisi bhi gendbaaji ko aasaani se khelte aae hai
 For these reasons, he has been able to play great drives, cuts and pull shots without putting much strength
 is tarah kii samajhadaari or shaareerik santulan lagaataar or ghante-dar-ghante puri lagan se practice karne ke baad hi ban paata he
 In addition to the usual and traditional methods, unique measures are also suddenly detected every time
 agar kisi ne gaur se dekha ho to use pataa chal gaya hoga ki sachin ke pair hameshaa donon viketon ke bich kii line main hote hai
 The bat is always in the line of the off stump and the backlift is done in such a way that it is easier to play the shot by bringing the bat forward
 ve jis takat se shot khelte hai, uski asal vajah yahi he ki ve puure santulan ke saath sharir kii takat laga pate hai
 You can sense a certain kind of plan behind each of his innings
 uske baad takanic to sachin ke khel main unki ajna kaa paalan karne vaali cheri kii tarah hoti he
 They do not use technology as a mere technique
 haalanki kai baar lagata he ki yah sambhav nahin magar ve aisa abhas dete hai ki unhone jaise har pari kii har gend ke liye taiyaari kar rakhi he, har gendbaaj kaa puraa adhyayan kiya he or har shot ke bare main soch-samaj rakhaa he
 This is what makes him a 'game Controller' and on many occasions a 'game Changer'
 kisi ke khel main dhire-dhire lagaataar giravat aana koi shame kii baat nahin he
 As has happened with Sachin
 lagaataar khelte rahane kii unki laalasaa ko bhi main samaj saktaa hum
 Amidst all these types of ups and downs, it has never felt that Sachin is not enjoying the game
 or ab jab unhone ise alavida kehane kaa faisla kar liya he to vah bhi unke har shot kii tarah ekadam parfect he

 CBFC ne film produsar prakaash jha ko ek chitthee bhejkar kaaran saaf kiya he ki kyon film ko pramanit nahin kiya gaya he

 dilli sarkaar ke nae sanshodhit niyam ke mutabik skulon ke paas 20 fisadi management cote ke tahat daakhile kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 The revised rule also scraped the alumnae criteria
 nursery admician: skool bas ke aria ko nebarhud maan ank de rahe skool!nae niyam ke mutabik nursery daakhile ke 75 fisadi open siton main skool sabase pehle 0-1 kilometre tak ke range ke bacchon ko admician degaa
 First of all, those children whose siblings study in the same school will get admission
 yani sibling criteria ke tahat 0-1 kilometre kii range main rahane vaale bacchon ko daakhile main praathamikta di jaaegi
 Nursery Admission: These tips will make every job easier - if the number of applications for Sibling Criteria in the range of 0-1 km is more than the school seat, then admission will be done through draw
 - agar 0-1 kilometre kii range main sibling daakhile ke baad bhi skool main siten khaali rah jaati hai to skool 0-1 kilometre ke daayre main rahane vaale bacchon ko pehle daakhila denge
 The draw will be done if the application is more
 - isi tarah skool seat khaali rahane par pehle 1-3 kilometre or uske baad 3-6 kilometre ke daayre main rahane vaale bacchon ko daakhila de sakenge
 25% of the school seats in nursery admission will be for EWS / DG category
 ye 298 skool wo hai jinhone didie se jameen praapt karte samay ek agreement par hastakshar kiye the
 Accordingly, they cannot refuse admission to the children of Neighborhood
 haalanki ab tak nebarhud diphine hi nahin kiya gaya tha
 But according to the new guidelines, these schools cannot refuse admission to their neighborhood children
 soshal media ke jamaane main ham har din kai tasviren dekhte hai or aage bad jate hai lekin kuch tasviren aisi hoti hai jo aage badhane nahin deteen
 This is one such picture of Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh, 65 km from the capital
 hapurjile main mohammad qaasim or 60 saal ke ek bujurg samiuddin ko bheed ne gaay chura kar kaatane ke naam par maaraa
 Mohammad Qasim died before reaching the hospital, while Sameeuddin was seriously injured
 police exiaar main ise 'road rej' kaa maamla bataaya gaya he
 Now the matter of this painful picture
 khun se lathpath jis insaan ko chaar log haath-pair pakad kar latakaate le ja rahe hai, wo mohammad kasim hi he
 The manner in which the injured Mohammad Qasim is being taken in the presence of the police is a living proof of our system being dead
 is tasviir ko gaur se dekhie to man baithne lagata he
 The mind starts buzzing with anger
 aisa lagata he ki agar vyavastha main thodi jaan bachi hoti to usase cheekh-cheekh ke sawaal karte
 Ask if you have heard the name of human rights? Are we not even able to follow common human behavior now? Do we deliver any injured person to the hospital like this? Do we take a dead body to a crematorium like this? But to whom should we ask this question? Can't ask the police as he called the case 'road rage' without any investigation
 wo khud is photo kii ek ahm kirdaar he
 The police are at the forefront of this painful picture
 unke peeche hi maanavtaa ke haath-pair pakadakar ghasita ja rahaa he
 This policeman is also aware of the power of the picture and that is why he is stopping the person taking the photo
 rahi baat bade baabuon kii, netaaon kii to wo philhal yoga karne-karwaane orfitness chalenjalene-dene main vyast hai
 He might not even care about these questions
 tasviir un tak pahonchegi to koi bayaan de denge
 Will express a little sadness
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki kuch na kahen, chup rahen
 On the arrival of such a picture, it is easiest to justify the police as guilty
 kehane kaa matlab he ki police to doshi he hi
 He is also visible par asal doshi wo vyavastha he jo garib yaa kamjor ko jaanavar ke baraabar maanata he
 Understands vyavastha kaa kasoor isliye bhi he kyonki usne jameen par kaam karne vaale adhikariyon ko maanavadhikaar ke prati sajag nahin banaaya
 Well, this is not the first picture
 isse milti-julati ek tasviir 2010 main ai thi
 In which security personnel were seen carrying a bamboo tied to the body of a Naxalite
 tab shaayad aisi tasviir pehali baar ai thi
 There was a lot of hue and cry
 rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne sidhe grahamantralay ko notice jari kiya tha
 But at the moment the picture which has come from Hapur is not making any special noise
 maanavadhikaar ke liye kaam karne vaali sansthaaen bhi chup hai
 The police system is also quiet
 haa, soshal media par kuch log ise lekar apni chaati peet rahe hai lekin jinaki asal javabdehi he wo philhal vishwa main yoga kii alakh jagaane main vyast hai
 If their busyness is over, there are some questions and answers

 Police are currently interrogating him and trying to locate his other partner
 teen din pehle yani shuukravaar ko anwar ne apni sports bike bechney kaa ishtahaar oelex company par diya
 The very next day he received a call from a English-speaking boy
 usne bike kharidne kii ichha jaahir kii
 The boy who bought the bike called Anwar under the Uttam Nagar West metro station
 anwar apni bike lekar vahaan pahunche to unhen do smart ladke mili or unhone motorcycle ko chalaakar check karne kii ichha zaahir kii
 After this, one man stood with Anwar and the other sat on the bike
 kuch dur le jaakar vah anwar ko bulaane laga ,jaise hi anwar thoda aage gaya unke saath khadaa vyakti vahaan se bhaag gaya or bike savaar vyakti tezi se bike ko le uda or anwar ke dekhte hi dekhte donon bike samet ankhon se ojhal ho gaye
 However, Anwar also took to social media to find bike thieves
 pehle police main shikaayat darj karwaai, phir choron ke mobile number ke sahare unke fasebuk or twitor acount ko check karnaa shuru kiya
 Hours later, they came to know of 3 fake ids
 choron ne baqayada luti gai bike kii tasviren farji number plate lagaakar apane fasebuk par laga rakhi thim
 Rana ji was written on the back of the bike and in addition to the pictures of the bike on the Facebook profile, "chief Officer at Badmash Company" was written

 Congress President Shahul Gandhi is on a tour of the Vindhya region of Madhya Pradesh
 rahul apane daure ke duusare din shuukravaar koriwajile main party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karenge
 This time there is a do or die situation for the Congress for 15 years away from state power
 yahi vajah he ki congress koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chaahati he
 The Rewa Mebaspaka in Madhya Pradesh adjoining UP has a good base
 yahi vajah he ki congress kii raah main sabase badi roda basapa bani hui he
 There have been 17 assembly seats in the Vindhya and Bundelkhand regions of the state where the BSP candidates got 30 thousand or more votes

 The Congress won 2 of these 8 seats in Rewa in the 2013 assembly elections
 jabakibijepico 5 or basapa ke khate ek seat gai thi
 Whereas in the 2008 elections, Congress' account in the district was also not opened
 dilachasp baat ye he ki basapa simriya vidhansabha seat par mahaj 6 hajaar voton se haar gai thi
 Apart from this, the BSP was the reason for the defeat of Congress in the remaining seats
 jile kii devatalab aisi vidhansabha seat he jahaan 1985 se congress jeet nahin saki he
 Since 1985, the BSP has won the election twice and the BJP three times
 2013 main reva kaa kaa sameekaran2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main reva main main congress kaa safaya ho gaya tha
 In 2003, there were 7 assembly seats in Rewa
 inamen se bijepi ke khate main 5 siten gai
 While BSP got 1 seat and CPM won one seat
 congress apana khaataa bhi nahin khol pai thi
 It was only this year that the BJP made a strong hold in Rewa
 congress kaa nahin khulaa khaataa2008 ke parisemen ke baad reva jile main simaria vidhansabha seat jud gai
 In this way the district got 8 seats
 bijepi ne apni jeet 2003 chunaav se 1 seat or badha lee
 In 2008, BJP won 6 seats in the district and BSP won 1 seat
 jabaki 1 seat par uma bharti kii party bhartiya janashakti party ko jeet mili 
 However, later the Bharatiya Janashakti Party merged with the BJP and the bjp's tally rose to 7
 reva main bijepi, congress, basapa ke saath-saath nirdaleey ummidavaar bhi taal thok rahe hai
 The BJP is struggling to maintain its fort
 vahiin, congress apni siten badhaane kii koshish main he, lekin basapa kii uski raah main sabase badi roda bani hui he
 The regional equations can dominate the 8 assembly seats of Rewa district as usual

 India Today's Agro Summit and Awards 2018 were attended by Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice-president Jayant Chaudhary, senior Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam, farmer leader VM Singh and agriculture expert Devendra Sharma
 is panel ke dwaara kheti or kheti se judi raajnneeti par baat kii gai
 The session was moderated by India Today Hindi editor Anshuman Tiwari
 aap bhi padhein kisne kya kaha
 
 
 Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, while referring to the farmers' distress, said, "there is a discussion about loan waiver of 1
5 lakh crores, minimum support price (MSP) and after that why farmers are upset
" karjamaafee bharat ke kisaan kii samasya kaa puri tarah se hal nahin ho saktaa he
 Until the real problem of the farmer is not understood, then the farmer of this country cannot be benefited
 jis tarah se desh ke aaazaad hone ke baad se paristhiti badali he
 Gajendra Singh said that farmers had a yield problem 30-40 years ago
 aaj sthiti badali hui he
 Today production has increased
 darasal, aazaadee ke baad se hi utpaadan badhaane par jor diya gaya, lekin ise khapaane kii disha main kaam nahin hua
 At present, we do not have the capacity to absorb the production we have
 ise lekar hamen kaam karnaa hoga
 Today the demand is less and the supply is more
 congress ke varisht netaa sanjay nirupam ne kaha, main nahin maanata ki hamaare desh main krishi niti nahin he
 i do not believe that there is no work for farmers
 aazaadee ke baad hamaare paas itnaa ann nahin tha ki ham logon ko khilaa saken
 We used to get food from outside
 aaj sthiti alag he
 Today our production has increased a lot
 lekin iske saath hi kisaanon kii jindagi kaa sankat bhi badha he
 Nirupa said that in the last three-four years, the suicides of farmers have increased in Maharashtra
 main buniyadi taur par yahi suzav duungaa ki hamen lone dene kii sthiti me sudhaar karnaa hoga
 It is our religion and karma that we stand with the farmers
 doosraa suzav ye he ki hamaare kisaanon ke paas aaj bazaad kii uplabdhta nahin he
 Will have to work on this also
 karj maafee antim hal nahin he, lekin taatkaalik taur par karj maaf karnaa hoga
 Jayant Chaudhary said, "there is a majority government at the moment
" aisi sarkaar se ummid bahut hoti he
 i ask why the debt of the farmer should not be forgiven? Well, this is not a permanent solution, it is like an ointment
 lekin malaham lagane kii bhi jarurat he
 Will the debts of corporate houses only be waived? jayant ne aarope lagaaya ki kisaanon ke saath chal kapat hua he ki kai rajyon main kaha gaya ki kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar diya gaya, lekin uskaa phayda kisaanon ko nahin hua
 When the yield of the farmer is so much that we can supply, then you are asking for it from outside
 upi main ye ghoshit hua ki aalu kii kharid hogi, lekin aap 1 pratishat kharid rahe hai
 What will happen with this chijen vyavhaarik nahin he
 Farmer leader VM Singh said, the government does not stand with the farmers, the government is compelled
 kisaan apane maa ke pet se kheti karnaa sikhta he
 We want the value of what we have produced
 jahaan tak baat rahi karja maaf karne se kuch nahin hone vaala
 It's not like this
 krishi visheshgy devendra sharma ne kaha, aaj jo kheti main sankat he ye sochi samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 The economy is designed from whom the farmer has to die
 kisaan kii jo kamai he wo kahaan se aati he
 If you look at the MSP, the income of farmers has increased only 19 times in 45 years
 devendra sharma ke mutabik agar sarkari karmchaariyon kii 19 guna badi hoti to kitne aatmahatya kar liye hote
 The problem with farming is not that you do not know how to do farming
 aapako jaan boojhkar garib rakhaa gaya he
 And this is happening in the world
 america or europe sabsidi detaa he
 i believe that the farmer should get a assured income

 aapako bataa den ki sena ke bahadur captain kapil kundu to mahaj 23 saal ke hi the jinka 10 farvari ko janmdin tha
 Pakistan's anger at the loc was visible since Sunday morning
 sabase pehle niyantran rekha se sate poonch jile ke shahpur main bhartiya sena ke post par baari golabari kii gai

 pakistan kii kaayarta kab takapakistan ke taaja sijafire ulanghan main bharat ne apane 4 vir javaanon ko kho diya he
 Though as usual the Indian Army also gave a befitting reply and ruined many posts of Pak army but the question is how long our soldiers will continue to be martyred by firing Pakistan
 
 
 aakhir kabatak ham sirf yaheen likhte or dikhaate rahenge ki bharat ne palatwaar karte hue pakistan ko karaara jawaab diya
 Yes, Pakistan has become completely uncontrollable on the border and now is the time when India will have to answer such that the fooled neighbors of the West abandon their nefarious antics forever
 pakistan lagaataar apni kaayarta ko dikhaa rahaa he or har par baar chup-chup kar bhartiya javaanon nishaanaa sadhta he

 Pallonji Mistry is the world's most anonymous billionaire
 kareeb 10 arab dollar (55,000 karod rupye) kii sampada vaala yah vyakti ascharyajanak rup se kahin dikhaai nahin detaa
 They are rarely seen or heard in any public place
 bharat ke sabase safal or taqatvar kaarobaariyon main se ek 82 varshiya palonji ke niyantran main ek aisa construction samrajya he jo bharat, pashchim asia or africa tak failaa hua he
 18 in his Tata Sons in association with his sons
 5 fisadi hissedari he
 Tata Sons $ 100 billion (rs 5,50,000 crore)
 ) ke tata samooh kii holding company he
 The Mistry family is thus the largest individual shareholder of India's most diversified business group
 palonji ko tata samooh ke mumbai sthit mukhyalay bombai house main, rob or kautuhal bhare lahaze main phantum ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After the retirement of Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata in December, his younger son, 43-year-old Cyrus Mistry, will command the glorious Tata Group
 construction ke diggaj palonji vaise to ek irish mahila se shaadi karne kii vajah se ireland ke naagarik ho gaye hai, lekin ve zyaadaatar samay bharat main hi mumbai ke vakwshwar main sagar kinare vaale bangale main rahete hai
 In the year 2012, Forbes had 9
 7 arab dollar (53,350 karod ru
 )
 is aadhaar par unhen na sirf parsi samudaay kaa sabase amir aadmi balki ireland kaa bhi sabase daulatmand shaks mana gaya
 Adi Godrej, chairman of the Godrej group companies, says that most of Pallonji's wealth comes from his shareholding in the Tata group
 echdiefasi ke chairman deepak paarekh yaad karte hai ki kis tarah se pehali baar mistre parivaar ne tata samooh ke share kharide the
 "pallonji's father used to construct the plant for Tata Motors and Tata Steel," he said
 tata samooh ke paas unhen dene ke liye paise nahin the to unhone isaki jagah unako share de die
 "pallonji gradually increased his family's shareholding
 unhone tata parivaar ke un sadasyon ke share bhi kharide jo kaarobaar se baahar nikalnaa chaahate the
 By the way, people close to him say that Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry is not a recluse
 palonji se 1968 se hi judaav rakhane vaale charchit architect hafeez contractor kehete hai, ''mere liye to ve bahut hi sulabh hai
 i can reach them anytime, over the phone or by going to their home or office
 ve hameshaa meraa swaagat garmjoshi se karte hai
 He is a brilliant man
 unka mizaaj dosti nibhaane or duusare kii madad karne vaala he
 However, the contractor is among the lucky few who have direct access to Shapoorji
 haal tak palonji 2
 5 billion dollars (rs 13,750 crore)
 ) ke shapurji palonji samooh (espiji) ke chairman hua karte the
 He handed over the kingdom to his 48-year-old elder son Shapoor earlier this year
 is samooh kaa kaarobaar kapade se lekar real estate, hospitality or bijness automation tak failaa hua he
 The SPG group includes Shapoorji Pallonji Engineering & Construction, Afcons Infrastructure, Forbes Textiles, Gokak Textiles, Eureka Forbes, Forbes & Company, SP Construction Material Group, SP Real Estate and Next Gen
 palonji associated cement companyj (ab asisi limited) ke chairman rah chuke hai or unhone company kii vaarshik mahasabha (agm) kii adhyakshata kii he
 Such agms are included in their rare public events
 asisi or tata samooh kii fermon sahit kareeb 1,000 companiyon ke share rakhane vaali ek niveshak ashalatha maheshwari kahati hai, ''maine asisi kii baithkon main unase baatcheet kii he, lekin yah kaaphi pehle kii baat he
 "palonji wants to know everything in detail and he is basically a perfectionist
 ve parfections ke liye prayaas karte hai chaahe iske liye kharch bajet se zyada hi kyon na ho jaae
 Hafeez Contractor, who currently works on eight projects for the group, says Pallonji has a simple philosophy, "we should make sure that the work is the best because we both have a name attached to it
" hamaare kisi bhi project par kaam shuru karne se pehle yah unka ek maanak bayaan hota tha
 "hafeez Contractor has worked with SPG on a number of projects: a boarding school for children - Sarla Birla Academy in Bangalore, a township project called 'empress City' in Nagpur and India's tallest Imperial Towers in Mumbai
" espiji ne bharat kii kai namchin imaaraten banaai hai-tajmahal pales and towers or da oberoi hotel (donon par 2008 main aatankwaadi hamalaa hua tha), mumbai-pune expresve, mumbai kaa breaborn stadium, world tered centre, pashchim asia main oman ke sultan kaa mahal or africa main ghana main raashtrapati kaa mahal
 Now it seems that power is changing in this group
 is saal kii shuruyaat main palonji ke kuch companiyon ke board se istipha dene ke baad se hi is baat kii charchaa tej ho gai ki ab samooh main nai vyavastha ban rahi he
 Elder Pallonji resigned from the board of Forbes & Company and Afcons Infrastructure in March citing reasons of age and health
 iske pehle unhone samooh dwaara shuru kii gai ek or company united motors (india) ke chairman pad se istipha de diya tha
 In early June, he officially handed over the post of SPG chairman, the flagship company of the group, to his elder son Shapoor
 iske liye koi tadak-bhadak yaa samaaroh nahin hua or media ko bhi maheene bhar baad isaki khabar mil pai
 Shapoor received the crown almost six months after younger brother Cyrus became deputy chairman of Tata Sons and was named chairman
 palonji ab ameritas (maanad) chairman kaa daayitv nibhaane ke saath samooh ko apni salaah dete rahete hai
 Says Parekh of HDFC, "palonji has sown his unwavering values in both sons which has carried his legacy forward
 '' bataaya jaataa he ki shapur ko espiji kaa chairman banaate vakt sirus ne unase kaha tha ki unke bacchon kaa bhavishya unke haathon main he
 Shapoor's secret appointment was on the same lines as Cyrus's successor to Ratan Tata in November 2011
 tata samooh dwaara ek aupchaarik bayaan jari karne ke baad hi media ko isaki jaankaree mil pai
 Its $ 83 billion (rs 4,56,500 crore)
 ) ke rajasav kaa kareeb do-tihaai hissaa videshon ke sanchaalan se hasil karne vaale tata samooh ne ratan tata ke uttaradhikari ke liye vaishvik str par pratibha khoj karne ke baad sirus kaa chayan kiya tha
 After all, this talent hunt was completed at home
 sirus kii bahan alu kii shaadi ratan tata ke sautele bhai noel se hui he or sirus varsh 2006 ke baad se hi tata sans ke diarector hai
 According to an agreement between SPG and the Tata group, the shareholding of the future chairman of the Tata group has been put into a trust
 haalanki sirus kii tarakkee se sabhi log aashwast nahin the
 Ashalata Maheshwari says, "when people told me that Cyrus was like a child, i also felt afraid that they would be able to run such a big empire?" But when Mr
 Tata (ratan Tata) took the position, he did not have much experience
 '' 75 varsh kii is shairdharak ne pehle kah diya tha ki ratan tata ke ritair hone ke baad ve kisi agm main nahin jaaengi
 But now he has changed his mind
 ve kahati hai, ''yah parivaar (mistre) sirf paise par jor dene vaala nahin he
 They are quite simple
 sirus yuva or budhimaan hai or mujhe lagata he ki tata sahab ne sahi nirnay liya he
 i will go to the AGM
 ''bade bete ke samooh se jude ek kaarobaari kehete hai ki palonji or unke bade bete shapur ke kaam karne ke dhang main antar he
 He explains, "palonji's policy is to solve every problem immediately and prevent it from becoming more serious
 samooh dwaara jo bhi contract liya jaataa he use vyaktigat samaj kar lagu kiya jaataa he or is vajah se yah samooh ek alag pahchaan rakhata he
 "but Shapur thinks differently
 company ke andar kii jaankaree rakhane vaale ek vyakti ne bataaya ki ve 'ranneetikaar' hai or shapur ne samooh ko ab global bhoomika nibhaane ke liye nayaa swaroop dena shuru kar diya he
 This can be seen in many group companies
 effcons infrastracchar (saal 2000 main kharidi gai) or forbs india (saal 2002 main kharidi gai) kii nae sire se branding kii ja rahi he
 According to sources, there will now be a new logo and the tagline will be 'built to Last'
 company ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, ''pehle do managing diarector samooche kaamkaaj ko dekhte the
 Only Shapoor is left after Cyrus moves to Tata
 sabhi chizon ko ek centre main laayaa ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, measures are being taken to further strengthen the activities of the group
 apni mukhya kshamtaaon par jor hoga or nae profeshnals ko joda jayega
 Shapoor has joined Jai Mavani, who was a director at pricewaterhousecoopers
 mawani ne isaki pushti karte hue kaha, ''ji haa, main is samooh se akjicutive diarector ke taur par judaa hum
 i will look at mergers, acquisitions and family businesses
 '' lekin unhone is babat zyada byora dene se inkaar kar diya
 In informal conversations, officials of Bombay House and SPG say that 'strict instructions' have been given not to talk to the media
 is report ke liye hamane palonji mistre, shapur mistre or sirus mistre ko vistrut prashnawali bheji thi, lekin kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 Little is known about the private life of the Mistry family
 shapur kii shaadi ek vakil roosi sethna kii beti behroj sethna se hui he
 He is the most flamboyant family member and loves horse racing
 parivaar ke paas pune main ek vishaal stad (ghode paalane kaa) farm he
 Cyrus is married to Rohika Chagla, daughter of well-known lawyer Iqbal Chagla
 palonji kii do betiyon main se ek laila kii shaadi rustam jahangir or alu kii shaadi noel tata se hui he
 "this family is connected to the land," says the contractor
 aap un logon se milenge to kabhi bhi yah nahin lagegaa ki ve itane daulatmand or mashhoor hai
 "these two sons, who take the helm of the fortunes of two of India's largest business groups, will need such qualities

 hyderabad airport se kuch dur aage nikal aane ke baad ek dukaan par ek saath kai adamkad murtiyon dekhakar laga ki kahin saare mahapurush laut to nahin aae hai
 i too withdrew my car and walked close to these idols standing in different postures
 apane-apane vichaaron ke saath maun mudra main khadi in adamkad murtiyon ke bhav padhanaa kisi kitaab se guzarane se kam nahin tha
 i was thrilled to think that if someday all these great men come back and find me together, what can i ask
 kisase pehle baat kerani chahie
 Not only are they bigger than my works, i also fell the least due to height
 dukandaar venkat swami ne bataaya ki zyaadaatar murtiyon saat foot kii hai, lekin doctor ambedkar kii oonchi murti hi zyaada bikati he
 These figurines are made here from fiber in a factory in Vijayawada and then after dyeing and painting, we make them worth selling
 sabase zyada murti kiski bikati he? mere is sawaal kaa jawaab dene main vekent ko second bhar nahin laga
 Said Doctor Ambedkar
 maheene main chaar-paanch murtiyon to bik hi jaati hai, lekin 14 april ke aasapaas khub cell hoti he
 How about the idols of other leaders? Venkat said that all the other idols are sold only two to four in a month
 inamen kabhi rajeev gandhi to kabhi vivekanand kii demand aa jaati he, par doctor ambedkar kii demand hameshaa rahati he
 In North India, only Ambedkar with blue coat is found, but in Venkat's shop, Ambedkar is wearing a blue shirt as well as a golden shirt inside the white coat, then one of his idols was painted in golden color from head to toe
 fibre kii bani saat foot kii murti kii keemat sattar hazaar rupee he
 They are light in weight, so even on a personal level, people buy and carry them
 venkat swami kii baton ko sunate-sunate main vahaan khadi murtiyon ko mahasoos karne laga
 It was felt that they all have become afraid of this world
 unke chehre par ek kism kaa bhay nazar aayaa ki koi aata hi hoga jo unhen kharid le jayega, unka bhav lagayegaa or phir raajnneeti chamakaayegaa
 Think, what will you do if you get Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, Dr
 Ambedkar, Mother Teresa, Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi all together
 inke vichaar bhale hi ab vot bhunaane ke kaam aate hai, par murti market main doctor ambedkar kaa muqabla koi nahin kar saktaa he
 Some of these great men who were given shields in the idols were waiting for their turn to be dyed, while some were shining with color
 jaise ab taiyaar ho gaye hai, bataao, kahaan chalanaa he
 While Dr
 Abandekar is raising his right hand with his finger, he is showing the path of liberation, while Swami Vivekananda is standing in a brown veneer instead of Gerua
 unke peeche madar terresa ke chehron par chintaa kii jhurriyaan pasri hui hai
 While the statue of Rajiv Gandhi is raising his hand and greeting him, Sonia Gandhi in a colorful sari and giving blessings in the currency of the object
 sonia ke bagal main indira gandhi haath neeche baandhe khadi hai, jaise kah rahi hon, "ab to jo he, so meri bahu hi he
 
 
 i did what i had to do, now to meet this for the next
 
 
 "tippaniyan The life-size idols of so many great men and political personalities stood together that they were competing to get ahead of each other
 doctor ambedkar haath uthaae apni ek anguli se mukti kaa maarg bataa rahe hai to vahiin swami vivekanand haath baandhe saumy rup se khadey hai

 After this, the workers of Aam Aadmi Party caught him and beat him up

 (also from the input language) srilanka ke khilaaf hue pehle or duusare test match main aswin ke alaava agar kisi or ne apni gendbaaji se prabhavit kiya he to vah hai amit mishra
 Amit has the full support of captain Virat Kohli
 utana hi jitna harbhajan singh ko
 Rather, Harbhajan has more faith
 lekin bhajji is bharose ko parinaam main nahin badal paae
 While Mishra took 5 wickets in the first test and took the maximum four wickets in the first innings of the second test, he got three wickets in the second innings
 tippaniyan In the second innings, he bowled a batsman like Dinesh Chandimal
 yah wicket isliye ahm he, kyonki chandimal hi the, jinhone pehle match main behtareen 165 ran naabad banaakar bharat se match chin liya tha
 The search for Ashwin's partner was going on for a long time
 purv test captain mahendrasingh dhoni ko ravindra jadeja par khud se zyada bharosa tha, unhone jadeja ko jarurat se zyada maukey die, lekin jadeja aswin kaa saath nahin de paae
 At least not in Test matches at all
 bharat or spin ke madadgaar treks par bhi nahin
 Kohli showed an impact in team selection as soon as Dhoni left
 amit mishra tukade-tukade main acha khelte rahe, lekin captain dhoni kaa vishwaas hasil nahin hone ke kaaran vah ek chhatke main baahar kar die jate the
 After becoming Virat's captain, Amit not only came directly into the team but was also fielded
 ab jabaki oktober se 4 test match bharat main hi hone hai amit bhartiya akramak main mukhya bhoomika nibhaayenge aswin ke saath
 In such a situation, now the pressure will be on Harbhajan because his place is not confirmed
 amit ko captain viraat kohli kaa puraa samarthan hasil he
 As much as Harbhajan Singh
 balki harbhajan ko zyada vishwaas hasil he
 But Bhajji could not change this confidence in the result
 jabaki mishra ne pehle test main 5 wicket liye or duusare test kii pehali pari main sabase zyada chaar wicket hasil kiye, jabaki duusari pari main unhen teen wicket mili
 The comments duusari pari main unhone dinesh chandimal jaise ballebaaj ko bold kiya
 This wicket is important because it was Chandimal, who snatched the match from India, scoring an unbeaten 165 in the first match
 aswin ke jodidar kii talash lambey samay se chal rahi thi
 Former Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had more faith in Ravindra Jadeja than himself, he gave more opportunities to Jadeja than needed, but Jadeja could not support Ashwin
 kam se kam test maichon main to bilkul nahin
 Not even on the helpful tracks of India and spin
 dhoni ke jate hi team chayan main kohli kaa asar dikhaa
 Amit Mishra continued to play well in pieces, but he was dismissed in a stick due to the lack of confidence of captain Dhoni
 viraat ke captain banate hi amit na keval sidhe team main aae bilki maidan main bhi utaare gaye
 Now that the 4 Test matches are to be held in India from October, Amit will play the main role in the Indian attack with Ashwin
 aise main ab dawaab harbhajan par hoga kyonki unki jagah pakki nahin he

 It is said that American officials are now bowing down to the tremendous pressure of the Indian government
 yues atorni preet bharaara ke offis ne kaha he ki devayani pehle apana ‚Äòaparaadh‚Äô sweekaar kar len (plid gilti) to unhen is maamle main sajaa nahin milegi
 The US government will forgive his sentence
 devayani ko yah baat pasand aa rahi he kyonki isse vah america main rah sakengi
 But the Ministry of External Affairs is against it
 angreji akhbaar da indian express ne khabar di he ki devayani or videsh mantralay main is mudde ke samaadhaan ko lekar matbhed ubhar aae hai
 The Ministry says that this will affect other cases as all such cases will cause further trouble
 iske alaava bharat jin muddon par lard rahaa he ve khatm ho jaaenge
 India wants clarity in this matter
 vah chahta he ki america main tainaat bhartiya diplomat ke liye aage koi samasya nahin aae
 The Indian government wants this case to be turned into a civil case and not a criminal one, as the US has done
 civil cese hone se yah kam mazdooree bhugtan kaa maamla ho jayega

 uske liye mahatvapurn he ki use diplomatic acridiation mili
 This would get him rid of the lawsuit
 iske baad bharat sarkaar use yahaan kabhi bhi laa sakati he
 But Devayani wants her permission to stay in the US because her husband is a US citizen and lives there
 america par or dabaavaudhar bharat sarkaar ne america mishan par or dabaav banane kaa nirnay liya he
 She wants to further cut the rights of her dirlomates so that they can be prosecuted for their crimes

 november 2016 main notebandi ke elaan ke baad modi sarkaar ne desh main cashles tranjaction par jor diya tha
 Now from July 1, by implementing GST across the country, the government has once again made a major reshuffle in the tax structure for the growing country in the direction of cashless transactions
 is baar sarkaar ke faisle se desh main bainkon ke liye atm suvidha dena mahangaa ho jayega kyonki 1 july ke badjiastike tahat bank ke liye atm mashin khareednaa mahangaa ho chukaa he
 The government has imposed the highest 28 percent tax on ATM machines
 iske alaava atm mashiinon kaa rakrakhaav karnaa or bhi mahangaa ho gaya he
 Presenting his important Union Budget after demonetisation in February 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced, "basic Custom Duty, Excise Duty, Countervailing Duty on POS Machines (point of Sale Machine) to promote cashless transactions in the country" Duties including others have been waived (zero per cent)
 "sarkaar ke is faisle se desh main bainkon ke liye pioes mashiinon kii kharid behad sasti ho gai thi or unke liye deshbhar main kaarobaariyon ko pioes mashin jari karnaa aasaan ho gaya tha
 From 1 July, this POS machine has once again been brought under the purview of GST
 jiesti dhaanche ke mutabik pioes mashin par ab 18 fisadi kii dar se tex lagegaa
 Hence, after the implementation of GST, it has become expensive for banks to expand POS machines to promote cashless transactions across the country
 gauratlab he ki november 2016 main notebandi lagu hone ke baad kuch maheenon takkashles tranjactionamen bada ijapha dekhne ko mila tha
 But as the new currency in the Reserve Bank market increased, the cash trend among the people also increased and the cashless transaction figures have started falling again
 lihaaja, jiesti main atm or pioes mashin par nae tex dhache kaa nakaaratmak asar padana tay he
 But the question is whether the central government tried to promote cashless transactions in the country after demonetisation, now it is preparing to reverse the GST

 jis saptaah ham 26 janvari ko apane samvidhan kaa 69 waan saal puraa karte hue ek mahatvapurn padaav yane sattavaren saal main pravesh karenge or isaki prastaavna main samahit samta, nyaay, swatantraaa or bandhuta kaa paath padhaaenge, par kya darasal yah kah sakenge ki in chaaron hi paimaanon par hamaare desh kaa hashr kya ho rahaa he ? baaki paimaanon par kya ho rahaa he, yah desh dekh hi rahaa he, lekin oxfam kii report hamaare desh main samta mulak samaaj kii sthapana main aarthik aadhaar par ek karaara tamaacha he jo yah bataata he ki is desh kii aadhi se zyada daulat nau raison par qurbaan he
 In such a situation, we can certainly praise the Republic, but how can the country accept whatever is happening with the original spirit of the book called Constitution after 166 meetings in 2 years, 11 months and 18 days? The richness of poverty cannot be accepted only by the argument that this gap has always been there, policy-makers have to see that this gap is constantly increasing
 kya is samvidhan diwas par ham yah sochenge ? yah desh kaa nahin duniya kaa sankat he
 The reports that have come out in the last three-four years are constantly pointing out that the world's economic wealth is getting more and more centralized and at least in the hands
 2016 main jin 57 logon ke paas duniya kii 3 karod 80 arab ke baraabar kii daulat thi vah uske agle saal main 44 logon tak aa simati or phir is saal yah usase bhi kam hokar ab keval 26 logon ke paas main he
 Ten percent of the people in India have about 77 percent of the country's wealth
 isse aage kaa aankada yah he ki hindustan main hi kul sampatti kaa aadhe se zyada keval 1 pratishat haathon main he or kareeb saath pratishat logon ke paas hi mahaj 4
 8 percent is wealth, this number in rupees is some four hundred million
 iske saath hi ek baat or yah ki bharat main pichley saal 18 nae dhankuber yani arbapati paidaa ho gaye hai, ab in dhankuberon kii sankhya badhatar 119 ho gai he
 Wow, how India is moving towards becoming an egalitarian society and how strange is the world that the world is running towards wealth and wealth is being drawn into a person's coffers, it is not justice of wealth, It is not even a justice of nature, it is also not a justice of the spirit of the Constitution
 hindustan main yah anyaay gaharaa he
 The poverty line kills the helpless every year, somewhere from hunger, disease, malnutrition and we can see that we are increasing our GDP by economic growth
 sawaal yah he ki yadi yah tarakkee he or vastav main desh dhanwaan he to desh kii sattar fisadi aabaadi ko is kalankini garibi rekha kii suchi se koun baahar nikaalega
 Therefore, when there is a matter of justice in the constitution, it cannot be just legal justice, the scope of that justice has to be seen in a broader context, which will consider the failure of policies not to accept the injustice of poverty even as a game of destiny
 And will also fix it
 isliye samvidhan ke is sattaren saal main jo mulya sthapit kiye gaye the, yah vakt unki samiksha karne kaa bhi he
 On the other hand, when it comes to putting money on works of public interest, it is said that the government treasury is empty
 corporate kii karjamaafee main shabdon ko badal kar use karjamaafee hi nahin mana jaataa or vahi baat kisaanon kii aati he to is desh kii arthvyavastha kii chintaa hone lagati he
 Why this double standard? Personally, i am not in favor of any such debt waiver unless the country brings such people out of the state of helplessness to enable that lending section to settle its debt with its own hard work
 , But if those conditions are created
 karjamaafee ko jab tak chunavi tantra main satta hasil karne kaa ek majboot hathiyaar mana jaataa rahegaa, tab tak to yah sambhav hi nahin he, lekin kisaan hi nahin, swasthya or shiksha jaise jaruri vishyon par bhi to sarkaar kaa puunji nivesh kai garib deshon se bhi kam he
 And in such a situation, if the reports of institutions like Asar, even the government reports like National Family Health Survey, tell the stories of the plight of public health and education, then surely in the seventeenth year of this constitution, we will have to turn back the pages in which India's ruin The public was assured that we will make our India a better nation
 aaiye ek baar phir in linon ko doharaa len, jo mahaj line nahin hai, yah hamaara desh he
 "we the people of India, to make India a fully sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic and all its citizens: social, economic and political justice, freedom of thought, expression, belief, religion and worship, prestige and opportunity
