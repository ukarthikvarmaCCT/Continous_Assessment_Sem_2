 budhiya singh ne chaar varsh kii umr main bhubaneshwar se puri tak kii 65 kimi kii duuri saat ghante or do minute main daudkar tay kii thi
 She was included in the Limca Book of Records in 2006 as the youngest marathon runner in the country
 budhiya ke jivan par ban rahi film kaa naam ‘budhiya singh- bourn tu ran’ he, jise saumendra padhi ne nirdeshit kiya he
 Budhia said that he was very happy to know that a film is being made on him and it stars Manoj Bajpayee as his coach
 usne kaha, ‘meri maa or bahan bhi bahut khush hui
 The director told me that a film is being made on my life and it will have Manoj Bajpayee
 ’ paanch varsh kii umr main budhiya ne apane coach biranchi das kii madad se 48 marathon main bhaag liya tha

 The comments ab 14 varsh kaa budhiya ek acha coach chahta he jo use use sapanom ko saakaar karne main madad kar sake
 He said, 'I just want a good coach and a good training

 pakistan main teen maheene se chal rahaa tanaav se bharpoor drama abhi bhale hi apane clymex par na pahunchaa ho lekin aakraamak bheed se ghiri parliament sthir hone kii kavayad main lagi he
 The support of Nawaz Sharif from every party in the National Assembly has given rise to the expectation that Sharif, who has been Prime Minister of the country three times, will escape from the crisis
 yah tathy hi jashn manaane kaa avasar de detaa he ki ve bhavishya main aise hi kisi sankat kaa saamana karne ke liye batch nikle hai
 Obviously, the fight is not over yet

 Their political future will depend on how they are able to keep a relationship with the powerful army
 jaise-jaise sthiti niyantran se baahar ho rahi he, generalon ke paas satta santulan kii chaabi aa gai he
 The army's order to resolve the crisis without using force is not a good omen for political leadership

 But it is not clear whether such a warning will come for the third time because the Parliament has united in support of Nawaz Sharif

 pradarshnon ke samay ko lekar bhi kai andeh ubhar rahe hai ki sainik or asainik netritv ke bich badhate tanaav kii khabaron se yah pradarshan prabhavit tha
 Javed Hashmi, the now estranged senior leader of the tehreek-e-insaaf, is in touch with some army officials, though the military has described the allegations as baseless
 sena pramukh raahil sharif ko pradhanmantri ne hi chunaa tha, lekin ateet kii kadavi yaadon ke chalate unke rishte asahaj hi rahe hai
 The tension between the two escalated when Sharif decided to prosecute former army general Pervez Musharraf on charges of treason
 nichali adaalat main parvej musharraf ko doshi qaraar die jane ke baad unhen desh chhodie kii ijaajat na dene se bhi pradhanmantri navaj sharif or senadhyaksh ke sambandh or khattey ho gaye
 There are two more incidents that ignite the collision
 taliban se ladaai par sharif kaa dhulmul ravaiya or kuch cabinet mantriyon kii sena ke khilaaf bayaanbaji ne tanaav badhaayaa hi he
 Not surprisingly, when Imran Khan and Qadri started their protest march, the government was suspected of conspiracy
 sena ke sidhe dakhal kaa to zyada khatra nahin he kyonki pakistani fouj uttar main taliban se ladaai main uljhi he or thak bhi chuki he
 Due to the full support of the Parliament for the Sharif, there is little doubt about the audacity of the generals
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki sarkaar ke sankat se nibatane main naakaam rahane kii vajah se sena pehle se zyada taqatvar ho gai he
 If the power of political leadership has decreased, then the army has restored its dominance

 The state has a BJP government and in the last Lok Sabha election, the BJP had captured all four seats
 congress apane diggaj netaaon ko maidan main nahin daudati he to rasta kathin hoga
 That is why there is a brainstorming about the candidates

 The Dhumal family is now taking this election seriously

 If you talk about the Congress, what is the BJP going to win on all four seats? ''yani bhaajapa ke chaaron saansad hi agar phir ummidavaar banate hai to congress ko bhi diggajon ko utaarna hoga
 Virbhadra or Vikramaditya from Mandi, Asha Kumari from Kangra, Sudhir or Bali, Agnihotri or Sukhvendra from Hamirpur and Dhaniram Shandil from Shimla contested if the BJP would have to exercise more

 In its directive to the banks, the RBI said that the government has extended the time limit of the scheme from April 2011 to March 2012 for four categories of exporters
 arabiai ne kaha, bank yah sunishchit kar sakate hai ki iskaa phayda puri tarah yogya niryaatkon ko hi mili

 There is a Hindu wave in the country and whatever is non-hindu is coming under criticism
 iske kai udhaaharan mil rahe hai lekin taaja udhaaharan he madrason par bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj kaa hamalaa
 Sakshi Maharaj is accusing the madrassas of promoting terrorism and doing things like love jihad
 ve unke yogadan ko puri tarah se khaarij karte hue unki katu aalochana kar rahe hai
 Many such Hinduist leaders had also criticized the madrasas earlier
 un sabhi kaa yahi kahana tha ki yahaan kattarwad ko badhaava diya jaataa he
 It is true that Islam is taught mainly in Indian madrasas, but there is no teaching of any kind of hatred towards any religion or community
 jo log madrason kaa itihaas jaanate hai unhen pataa hoga ki prasiddh samaaj sudhaarak raja rammohan raay bhi bengal ke ek madrase main padhe the
 Hundreds of Hindu religious leaders like him got education in madrasas at that time
 bharat main madrase mughal kaal main fale-foole the or vahaan shiksha kii paryaapt vyavastha thi
 Actually madrasa means the place of education
 madrason main sabhi dharmon ke logon ko padhane kii aazaadee thi or kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav nahin tha
 In Bengal, higher education was also given in madrasas
 madrase kuch aise the jaise isai mishanri ke shiksha santhaan hote the
 But what has happened today that questions have arisen on these madrasas? The truth is that the reason for their popularity is not religion but poverty
 aaj bhi bharat ke kai hisson main musalamaanon ke bacchon ke liye padhane ke liye sansthaaon kii kami he
 They want their children to read but know their religion properly
 ve chaahate hai ki unke bachche na keval urdu or arabi padhein balki apane majahab ke bare main puri gyaan praapt karen
 It is also true that the great job of madrassas is to tell about Islam and Quran Sharif which every Muslim wants
 gramin ilaakon main sarkari skulon kii haalat kisi se chuphi nahin he
 So they send their children to study there
 ab isse anya dharmavalambiyon ke man main yah dharna baith sakati he ki isse samaaj ke vibhinn dharm ke logon main algaav kii bhaavana badhegi
 This thing also has power
 lekin iskaa ilaaj kya ho saktaa he, is par sabhi udaarvaadiyon ko baithkar vichaar karnaa hoga
 Just criticizing them or raising the issue of modernization will not solve the case
 madrason ko badalte samay ke saath kitna badla ja saktaa he, is bare main vichaar to hona hi chahie
 What else can be taught to children there other than Islam, should be discussed together with Muslim scholars
 madrason main islam kii padhai ho rahi he to usamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 There is a need to introduce the children studying there to the modern education system, to provide them employment-oriented education and knowledge of science
 yah koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 Even today, five percent of Muslim children study in madrasas
 unhen behatar shiksha in sansthaaon ko aadhunik banaakar hi diya ja saktaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a big step in this direction by giving large amount for modernization of madrasas

 The way the BJP has prepared carpet bombing through 50 veteran leaders including the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Chief Ministers, the Congress has decided to adopt 'guerilla War' techniques for campaigning
 rahul gandhi kaa paanchvaan gujarat daurarahul gandhi navasarjan yatra ke tahat ab tak gujarat main 3-3 din ke chaar daure kar chuke hai
 Rahul is scheduled to visit Gujarat for a fifth day on Friday for the fifth time
 rahul ke gujarat dauron kii khaas baat ye he ki inamen party kaa rashtriya str kaa yaa kisi duusare rajya kaa koi netaa nahin hota
 Only the general secretary and the state leader are in charge of the party
 prachaar ke liye congress kii trek 2 ranneeticongress kaa maananaa he ki rahul kaa gujarat main thode thode antaraal ke baad janaa, party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon main josh banaae rakhane main bahut kargar sabit hua he
 Along with keeping the party in charge, people also effectively keep the party's side
 rahul congress ke paas sabase bade ‘croud pular’ cheharaa hai
 After Rahul, the Congress fielded its other leaders according to the 'track 2' strategy in terms of penetration in the area and people
 gujarat kii simaaen teen rajyon- madhya pradesh, rajasthan or maharashtra se satee hai
 When Rahul is not on tour, party leaders from these three states are holding rallies in their areas of influence
 yahi vajah he ki in teen rajyon se taalluk rakhane vaale netaaon, jaise ki sachin payalat, jyodiraditya sindhiya, sanjay nirupam or prithviraj chavaan kii gujarat main party ke prachaar ke liye kaaphi demand he
 The party is promoting the rallies of its leaders through Facebook, youtube and Twitter
 jaise jaise matdaan kii taarikh najadik aaengi, party prachaar main takat badhaati jaaegi
 The issue of inflation will also be raised vigorously Congress has been strongly raising the issues of demonetisation and GST in the Gujarat election campaign

 Under 'counter Tactics', it will be kept in mind that where rallies of Prime Minister Modi or other big leaders of BJP are held, programs of Congress leaders should also be organized around that
 koshish yahi rahegi ki congress kaa paksh bhi hathonhaath us ilaake ke logon ke bich pahunch jaae
 While such programs may not be received attention on the national media, the message will be broadcast locally through newspapers and channels

 He is more than eighty years old and does his work quietly
 vah apane jazamaanon ke bare main kisi ko nahin bataate hai or puri gopneeyata baratate hai

 The political outcome of Bihar in the Lok Sabha Election was shocking for several reasons
 pehla kisi ko is baat kaa andaaj nahin tha ki puraa vipaksh maatr ek seat jeet paaegaa
 But the most surprising was the two percent strike rate of two parties BJP and Lok Janshakti
 lekin janata dal jisane 17 main se 16 siten jiti
 By winning a few seats, the geography of Bihar's politics has changed
 aaie jaanate hai ki ye koun si siten hai or vahaan kya aisi khaas baat hui
 1
 katihaar loksabhaa: is seat se janata dal united ke tikat par doctor dulaal chand goswami qareeb saath hazaar ke antar se congress party ke tarik anwar ko haraaya
 Goswami comes from a very backward caste and lost in the last assembly election
 yah pehali baar he jab koi ati pichhadi jati se is seat se saansad chunaa gaya he or mana jaataa he ki ye seat janata dal united ke khate main aane ke kaaran hi goswami pratyaashee ko yahaan se tikat mila or wo jite bhi
 This seat was either won by Tariq Anwar or Nikhil Chaudhary from the upper caste from the Bharatiya Janata Party
 2
 Bhagalpur: Even from this seat, which was considered a traditional seat of the Bharatiya Janata Party, for the first time the Janata Dal was contesting the United Elections and in it the rjd's Bulo Mandal, who comes from the low Gangota caste of the most backward community, in front of Ajay Mandal Landed
 haalanki, ajay mandal kii apni vyaktigat chhavi bahut acchhee nahin rahi lekin gangota ummidavaar ke saamne bhangurta jati ke hi ummidavaar ko utarkar yah seat lakh ke adhik ke antar se janata dal united jiti or ab bhavishya kii raajnneeti main yah tay mana ja rahaa he ki ve is seat par ladaai ati pichhadi samudaay ke hi do ummidavaaron ke bich main is chunaav ke tarah hi hoga is seat se bhartiya janata party ke tikat par shahanwaaz hossain chunaav jite the yaa janata dal yaa rajd ke tikat par chun chun yadav
 3
 jahanabad seat: is seat kaa raajnneetik itihaas brihaspativaar ko chunaav parinaam ke pehle yahi rahaa tha ki jeetne vaala ummidavaar yaa to yadav jati se hota tha yaa bhoomihaar jati se, lekin nitish kumaar ne is chunaav main ati pichhadi jati ke chandeshwar prasad chandravanshi ko maidan main utarkar ek tarah se nai rekha khinch di
 Chandravanshi won the elections from a few thousand boards but Nitish Kumar had to make a lot of effort to ensure his victory and he was repeatedly reminded that his decision has caused a lot of anger among the Bhumihar caste voters but now see It is that after this victory, Nitish Kumar retains his new political experiment on this seat or on the old pattern of any forward caste Let the candidate have a chance
 4
 Sitamarhi: In the midst of elections on this seat, Nitish Kumar had to change his candidate
 unhone bhaajapa ke purv vidhayak, sunil pintu jo vaisya samaaj se aate hai unhen tikat diya or pintu dhai lakh vot se chunaav jite
 Even in this seat till the last Lok Sabha, the party was no winner, was from the Yadav caste but in 2014, Ram Kumar Sharma won on the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party ticket
 is tarah chunaav parinaam ke baad jahaan atipichdi jati ke logon ke liye mujaffarpur or jhanjharpur do vaqt kii seat maani jaati thi usamen nitish kumaar ne is baar ke chunaav parinaam ke baad jahanabad, katihaar or bhagalpur kaa bhi naam jod diya
 Though bjp's Pradeep Singh from Araria has also won a voice election, this is the first election when such a large number of people from the backward community are going to the Parliament from Bihar

 itnaa hi nahin shoma choudhary ke nem plate par in logon ne 'aaropee’ bhi likh diya
 Earlier, former BJP president and Delhi BJP in-charge Nitin Gadkari has told NDTV India that action will be taken if Vijay Jolly did wrong
 nitin gadakari ne kaha ki yah bijepi kaa pryojit kaaryakrim nahin tha
 This was the personal response of those people

 supreme court ne kaha he ki dahi handi vaale bees foot se ooncha nahin ja sakate hai
 Now there is a political dispute about this
 shivasena, manase or bijepi kaa kahana he ki supreme court ko sthaneey parampara main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie
 This is the government's job
 maharashtra sarkaar ne bhi kaha he ki nirdeshon kaa paalan hoga
 Handi mandals say that if the hand does not hang up, then the thrill will go away, but will the organizers risk breaking the law or will the police take action
 maharashtra sarkaar ke khel vibhaag ne dahi handi ko adventure sports kaa darja diya hua he
 What do those who have been injured say? tippaniyan We spoke to Nagesh Bhoir, a Govinda from Bhiwandi
 nagesh bachapan se hi handi phodte aa rahe the lekin 2009 main chah tal se gir gaye
 The entire part under Nagesh's neck became paralyzed
 ve 2009 se hi bistar par pade hue hai
 Nagesh has so far had eight operations and three more operations are to be done
 abhi tak 35 lakh rupee lag gaye hai or aage ke oparation kaa kharchaa das lakh tak aa saktaa he
 Nagesh says that after bursting the hand, everyone gets engrossed in Ganapati
 koi dekhne nahin aata ki jo govinda gire hai unki kya sthiti he
 Before 2009, i used to work in the bank but now i am unemployed and i am lying in bed
 yaar doston ne madad kar di varna koi bhi aayojak mandal aage nahin aayaa
 Everyone keeps announcing ten lakhs and twenty lakhs in reward, no one is worried about Govinda
 nagesh kaa kahana he ki bees feet chaar tal ke baraabar hota he
 This is enough and it can be quite thrilling
 isse zyada nahin hona chahie
 Court order is fine
 2013 main 641 govinda ghayal hue, 2014 main 290 govinda ghayal hue, 2015 main 130 govinda ghayal hue
 Nagesh has a point that by taking risks, Govinda becomes a hero for a few minutes but as soon as he falls, he becomes a burden on the family forever
 agar ise aasthaa ke naam par banaae rakhana he to aayojakon ko unki suraksha kii bhi guarantee deni hogi
 Nikhil Kadam has stated that practice starts a month in advance
 mandal ke govinda raat ko nau baje ke baad jamaa hote hai or dedh do ghante kaa abhyaas karte hai
 These pyramids you are seeing in the local tongue are called five floors, six floors, seven floors, eight floors or nine floors
 tal matlab oonchai
 Just like you speak Ek Talla Makan, Dutalla Makan
 chah tal dahi handi lagane ke liye sau se dedh sau logon kii zarurat hoti he
 First down there are eight people
 uske upar paanch log hote hai
 Then there are three people
 teen ke upar ek ek kar teen hota he
 There is a ladder next to each other
 ye seedhi bhi govinda hi banate hai
 They form a circle and climb on their shoulders, go over the Govinda pyramid
 aas paas ke mohalle se govinda jamaa hote hai or abhyaas chaalu kar dete hai
 Then one or two days before Dahi Handi, decide your route, which route to go so that maximum Dahi Handi can be covered
 iske liye trek yaa bas kiraaye par lete hai
 T-shirt is made for Govinda
 kul milakar ek lakh rupee tak kaa kharchaa aa jaataa he
 Then two people go ahead to find out where the curd handi is happening
 unki soochna par inaki team pahunchati he or salaami detii he
 The salute means that if the team successfully makes seven floors or a trickle, then the organizer gives five hundred to two thousand rupees in reward
 kahin kahin zyada bhi hota he
 It is not necessary that every team breaks the hand
 handi todane ke liye nau tal banane hote hai
 Not all dahi handi are included in the nine-floor game
 nikhil kadam ne bataaya ki puraa din cover karne ke baad bhi hamen tees se chalis hazaar hi inaam main mil paata he
 We get less than what we plant
 bas junun ke liye karte hai
 The Supreme Court has said that the curd handi cannot be higher than twenty feet
 ab ise lekar raajnneetik vivaad ho rahaa he
 Shiv Sena, MNS and BJP say that Supreme Court should not interfere in local tradition
 yah sarkaar kaa kaam he
 The Maharashtra government has also said that the instructions will be followed
 handi mandalon kaa kahana he ki agar handi upar nahin lataki to romaanch hi chalaa jayega lekin kya aayojak kanoon todane kaa jokhim uthaaenge yaa phir police karrwai karegi
 The Sports Department of the Government of Maharashtra has given Dahi Handi the status of Adventure Sports
 jo ghayal hue hai unka kya kahana he
 The comments hamane bhiwandi ke ek govinda nagesh bhoir se baat kii
 Nagesh had been bursting his hand since childhood but in 2009 he fell from six floors
 nagesh kii gardan ke neeche kaa puraa hissaa paralined ho gaya
 He has been in bed since 2009
 nagesh kaa abhi tak aath oparation ho chukaa he or teen or oparation hona he
 So far, 35 lakh rupees have been spent and the cost of further operation can come up to one million
 nagesh kaa kahana he ki handi footne ke baad sab ganpati main mashgool ho jate hai
 No one comes to see what the condition of Govinda has fallen
 2009 se pehle main bank main jaab karata tha lekin ab berojgaar hum or bistar par padaa rahata hum
 My friends helped, otherwise no organizer board came forward
 sab inaam main das saal bees lakh kaa elaan karte rahete hai, govinda kii kisi ko phikr nahin hoti
 Nagesh says that twenty feet is equal to four floors
 yah kaaphi he or isamen bhi kaaphi romaanch aa saktaa he
 Should not be more than this
 court kaa aadesh thik he
 641 Govinda injured in 2013, 290 Govinda injured in 2014, 130 Govinda injured in 2015
 nagesh kii is baat main dam he ki jokhim lekar govinda chand minuton ke liye hero banate hai magar girte hi ve parivaar par hameshaa ke liye boj ban jate hai
 If it is to be maintained in the name of faith, the organizers must also guarantee their safety
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dahi handi vaale bees foot se ooncha nahin ja sakate hai
 Now there is a political dispute about this
 shivasena, manase or bijepi kaa kahana he ki supreme court ko sthaneey parampara main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie

 What do those who have been injured say? tippaniyan We spoke to Nagesh Bhoir, a Govinda from Bhiwandi
 nagesh bachapan se hi handi phodte aa rahe the lekin 2009 main chah tal se gir gaye
 The entire part under Nagesh's neck became paralyzed
 ve 2009 se hi bistar par pade hue hai
 Nagesh has so far had eight operations and three more operations are to be done

 Nagesh says that after bursting the hand, everyone gets engrossed in Ganapati
 koi dekhne nahin aata ki jo govinda gire hai unki kya sthiti he
 Before 2009, i used to work in the bank but now i am unemployed and i am lying in bed
 yaar doston ne madad kar di varna koi bhi aayojak mandal aage nahin aayaa
 Everyone keeps announcing ten lakhs and twenty lakhs in reward, no one is worried about Govinda

 This is enough and it can be quite thrilling

 yahi ki ab raajnneeti main adarsh or naitikta ko hameshaa ke liye chhod dena chahie
 It has been left out, but it should also be called off at the level of questions and accountability
 dashakon se janata dekhati aa rahi he ki kis tarah se ek rajnatik dal apni aniatikta ko bachaane ke liye duusare dal kii aniatikta se prerana pate hai
 i jokingly called it the 'equal to theory' of politics, but political parties became more serious about proving it
 bhaashan baat ko kehane kii kala he, apane aap main baat nahin he
 Converting the questions raised from your speech into a question for another court does not create an answer
 sawaal banataa he ki akhir ye kab or kaise hua ki donon ek duusare ke jaise banate chale gaye
 Is the destiny of the Congress to be the BJP and the destiny of the BJP is to be the Congress
 baaki jo nae dal hai unki niyati bhi aapas main yaa ek duusare ke barakes alag nahin he
 All are parallel and all are equal
 ye raajnneeti kii maut he
 There is no other public function imaginative and creative than politics in the world, but its condition is similar to Bollywood's b grade super hit films
 poocha jaataa he ki june main barish kyon nahin hui to jawaab aata he agast main tufaan kyon aayaa
 June is buried due to August
 kya charchaa is baat ko lekar thi ki congress ke rajeev gandhi ne anderson ko kyon bhagaaya
 Why was Quattrocchi banished? Was the discussion about how the Income Tax Department appointed Chidambaram's wife as finance minister while he was the finance minister? Sushma Swaraj told that Chidambaram survived easily when there was discussion in the previous government in Rajya Sabha
 ab kise yaad hoga ki tab bijepi ne chidambaram ko aasaani se kyon choda
 But what Sushma Swaraj was telling from the speech art that i had made a mistake like Chidambaram
 jab hamane unhen bachake jane diya to aap bhi hamen bachakar jane dijiye? Hearing the speech, the people who were affected were able to remember what are the various aspects of these questions
 All these have been discussed enough in Indian politics and may be renewed many times but they cannot be answered with the help of Lalit Modi
 ye sab congress kii kaali kothri kii wo kalikh he jisase kaajal laga kar bijepi apana rup nahin sanvaar sakati
 Later, Congress devotees took to social media from Google to explain why Arun Jaitley, as Law Minister, had suggested that the case of bringing Anderson to India was weak
 lekin kya is tarah se janata kii samaj behatar hoti he
 Does she understand these talisman pleas and allegations in detail? Does he get an answer? This is the case of Lalit Modi
 congress par bhagane kaa aarope he to bijepi par landan main basaane kaa 
 The question to Sushma was that why did you help Lalit Modi? He very easily molded Lalit Modi's wife
 shaayad is ummid main mahila matadaata kush ho jaayengi ki mahila kii madad to antim satya or karm he
 People will understand what is wrong if they have helped the poor patient
 isi dam par sushamaa swaraj kahati raheen ki agar ye gunaah he to ye gunaah kiya he 
 But this was not the question
 sawaal tha ki sabakuch vyaktigat str par kyon kiya
 Why not tell the ministry
 do mulkon ke sambandh kii guarantee lalit modi ke liye di gai yaa unki patni ke liye
 She herself kept saying that help was there but kept asking for evidence to show that i had written something
 jaise ki aniatikta sirf likh kar hoti he
 Lalit Modi is a fugitive only then a red corner notice has been issued against him this August
 sawaal us bhagode kii madad kaa tha jo landan main baitha muskura rahaa he
 Who goes missing by dodging the Congress government and makes a direct call to the foreign minister of the BJP government
 hamaari raajnneeti kaa laalitya ban jaataa he 
 In the same way, Congress could neither stand on its own questions nor answer Sushma's questions
 wo apane gunahon se itani bhaybheet ho gai ki sushamaa ke ilzaamon ke aage dharaashahee ho gai
 Defeated his own questions
 anderson or kwatroki kaa kuch jawaab to banataa hi tha
 When the matter arose, the answer should have come
 jawaab dene ke liye rahul gandhi aae to laga ki jawaab milegaa
 Did not answer jawaab nahin mila to vyaktigat baatcheet ko hathiyaar bana liya
 Sushma Swaraj said that one day before the debate, holding her hand and said that son why are you angry with me
 rahul ne kaha ki main gussa nahin hoon
 When i am with Satya, Sushma ji glanced at him
 sadan main sushamaa chup hokar sunati raheen
 i felt that now she will rise up and make Rahul Gandhi wonder
 magar bhaashan kala main maahir sushamaa swaraj ke paas koi hathiyaar nahin bachaa tha
 Sushma should have told why Rahul Gandhi's hand was held? Was she finding a way to escape emotionally by saying son? Did they really look down? Rahul Gandhi was exposed to the conversation with Sushma Swaraj to cover the crimes of Anderson and Quattrocchi
 yahi bataa dete ki lalit modi unki party ke raaj main kyon bhaaga? kis kis ne madad kii?tippaniyan This has been happening, this is what happened and this will happen
 sawaal ke jawaab us sawaal se nahin milenge
 Congress and BJP together won Lalit Modi
 lalit modi nahin jeetta to congress or bijepi buudhvaar kii bahes main nahin batch pate
 The speaker should also conduct the debate as well as see if the questions are being answered on both sides
 lalit modi ko kyon bachaaya kaa jawaab yah nahin ho saktaa ki anderson ko kyon bhagaaya
 It is not enough just to create an atmosphere of speaking
 bhopal gas cond ke aaropee anderson ko lekar sabaki atmaaon ko itnaa hi dard ho rahaa tha to ek charchaa bhopal gas cond ke peediton kii haalat par ho jaae
 However, the result of the Lok Sabha debate was that everyone got a chance to demonstrate speech skills
 sabaki raajnneeti jab ek si ho jaati he, tab raajnneeti mar jaati he
 Democracy dies when the choice becomes equal in a democracy

 That is why Hindu communalism and Muslim communalism are encouraged so that you may get annoyed but it becomes difficult for you to change your face

 All this is the soot in the black cell of the Congress, by which the BJP cannot change its appearance by applying kajal
 baad main congressi bhakt soshal media par google se nikaalkar bataane lage ki kanoon mantri ke taur par arun jetali ne kyon raay di thi ki anderson ko bharat laane kaa cese kamazor he
 But does public understanding better in this way
 kya wo in talibaaz daleelon or aaropon ko vistaar se samaj paati he? kya use jawaab miltaa he? yahi cese to lalit modi kaa he
 If Congress is accused of exorcism, then BJP should settle in London
 sushamaa se sawaal tha ki aapane lalit modi kii madad kyon kii? unhone bahut aasaani se lalit modi kii patni ko dhaal bana liya
 Perhaps women voters will be happy in the hope that the help of women is the ultimate truth and action
 log samajhenge ki bechaari mariz kii madad kii he to galat kya he
 Sushma Swaraj kept on saying that if she is a crime then she has committed a crime
 par sawaal ye nahin tha
 The question was why did everything on a personal level
 mantralay ko kyon nahin bataaya
 The relationship between the two countries was guaranteed for Lalit Modi or for his wife
 khud kahati raheen ki madad kii he lekin saboot maangati raheen ki dikhaa to dijiye ki maine kuch likh kar diya he
 As such immorality is just by writing
 lalit modi bhagoda he tabhi to isi agast main uske kilaaf red carnor notice jari hua he
 The question was of the help of the fugitive who is smiling sitting in London
 jo congressi sarkaar ko chakma dekar laapata ho jaataa he or bijepi sarkaar ke videsh mantri ko sidhaa phone kar detaa he
 The elegance of our politics becomes
 usee tarah congress na to apane sawaalon par tiki rah saki na sushamaa ke sawaalon kaa jawaab de saki
 She was so frightened by her crimes that Sushma became accused in front of the charges
 apane hi sawaalon se pallaa jhaad liya
 Anderson and Quattrocchi had some answers
 jab baat uth gai thi to jawaab aana chahie tha
 When Rahul Gandhi came to answer, he felt that the answer would be found
 jawaab nahin diya
 If the answer was not received, then personal conversation became a weapon
 kehane lage ki sushamaa swaraj ne bahes se ek din pehle unka haath pakad kar bolaa ki betaa tum mujhase gussa kyon ho
 Rahul said that i am not angry
 main satya ke saath hoon to sushamaa ji ne nazar jhukaa lee 
 Sushma kept listening silently in the house
 mujhe laga ki ab ve uthakar rahul gandhi ko laajawab kar dengi
 But Sushma Swaraj, a master of speech art, had no weapon left
 sushamaa ko bataanaa chahie tha ki rahul gandhi kaa haath kyon thama? kya betaa kahkar bhaavnaatmak rup se bachane kaa rasta khoj rahi thim? kya vaaqai unki nazar neeche hui? rahul gandhi anderson or kwatroki ke congressi gunahon par pardaa daalane ke liye sushamaa swaraj se hui baatcheet se pardaa uthaa gaye
 He would tell why Lalit Modi ran under his party's rule
 Which one helped? Comments yahi hota rahaa he, yahi hua or yahi hoga
 The questions will not be answered by that question
 congress or bijepi me milakar lalit modi ko jeeta diya
 If Lalit Modi does not win, then Congress and BJP would not have survived in Wednesday's debate
 spikar ko bhi bahes sanchalit karne ke saath-saath dekhnaa chahie ki donon taraf sawaalon ke jawaab mil rahe hai yaa nahin
 Why Lalit Modi was saved cannot be the answer to why he drove Anderson
 sirf bolne kaa maahaul bana dena hi kaaphi nahin he
 Everyone's souls were feeling so much pain about the Bhopal gas scandal accused Anderson, so a discussion should be made on the condition of the victims of the Bhopal gas scandal
 baharhaal loksabhaa kii bahes kaa nateeja yah niklaa ki sabko bhaashan kaushal ke pradarshan kaa mauqaa mila
 When everyone's politics becomes the same, then politics dies
 loktantr main jab vikalp ek samaan ho jaae to loktantr mar jaataa he
 Activities against democracy start happening
 janata kii awaz dabane lagati he, is samaan sthiti main aapane dekha hoga ki raajnneetik dal kaaryakarta kii jagah sadsy banane par jor de rahe hai
 They want to divide your politicization
 isiilie hindu sampradayikta or muslim sampradayikta ko badhaava diya jaataa he taaki aapke naaraaz to ho saken magar aapke liye paala badalanaa mushkil ho jaae
 So now in this democracy the public will always lose
 wo matdaan pratishat se kush hona chaahati he to ho le
 The question to Sushma was that why did you help Lalit Modi? He very easily molded Lalit Modi's wife
 shaayad is ummid main mahila matadaata kush ho jaayengi ki mahila kii madad to antim satya or karm he
 People will understand what is wrong if they have helped the poor patient
 isi dam par sushamaa swaraj kahati raheen ki agar ye gunaah he to ye gunaah kiya he 
 But this was not the question
 sawaal tha ki sabakuch vyaktigat str par kyon kiya
 Why not tell the ministry
 do mulkon ke sambandh kii guarantee lalit modi ke liye di gai yaa unki patni ke liye
 She herself kept saying that help was there but kept asking for evidence to show that i had written something
 jaise ki aniatikta sirf likh kar hoti he
 Lalit Modi is a fugitive only then a red corner notice has been issued against him this August
 sawaal us bhagode kii madad kaa tha jo landan main baitha muskura rahaa he
 Who goes missing by dodging the Congress government and makes a direct call to the foreign minister of the BJP government
 hamaari raajnneeti kaa laalitya ban jaataa he 
 In the same way, Congress could neither stand on its own questions nor answer Sushma's questions
 wo apane gunahon se itani bhaybheet ho gai ki sushamaa ke ilzaamon ke aage dharaashahee ho gai
 Defeated his own questions
 anderson or kwatroki kaa kuch jawaab to banataa hi tha
 When the matter arose, the answer should have come
 jawaab dene ke liye rahul gandhi aae to laga ki jawaab milegaa
 Did not answer jawaab nahin mila to vyaktigat baatcheet ko hathiyaar bana liya
 Sushma Swaraj said that one day before the debate, holding her hand and said that son why are you angry with me
 rahul ne kaha ki main gussa nahin hoon
 When i am with Satya, Sushma ji glanced at him
 sadan main sushamaa chup hokar sunati raheen
 i felt that now she will rise up and make Rahul Gandhi wonder
 magar bhaashan kala main maahir sushamaa swaraj ke paas koi hathiyaar nahin bachaa tha
 Sushma should have told why Rahul Gandhi's hand was held? Was she finding a way to escape emotionally by saying son? Did they really look down? Rahul Gandhi was exposed to the conversation with Sushma Swaraj to cover the crimes of Anderson and Quattrocchi
 yahi bataa dete ki lalit modi unki party ke raaj main kyon bhaaga? kis kis ne madad kii?tippaniyan This has been happening, this is what happened and this will happen
 sawaal ke jawaab us sawaal se nahin milenge
 Congress and BJP together won Lalit Modi
 lalit modi nahin jeetta to congress or bijepi buudhvaar kii bahes main nahin batch pate
 The speaker should also conduct the debate as well as see if the questions are being answered on both sides
 lalit modi ko kyon bachaaya kaa jawaab yah nahin ho saktaa ki anderson ko kyon bhagaaya
 It is not enough just to create an atmosphere of speaking
 bhopal gas cond ke aaropee anderson ko lekar sabaki atmaaon ko itnaa hi dard ho rahaa tha to ek charchaa bhopal gas cond ke peediton kii haalat par ho jaae
 However, the result of the Lok Sabha debate was that everyone got a chance to demonstrate speech skills
 sabaki raajnneeti jab ek si ho jaati he, tab raajnneeti mar jaati he
 Democracy dies when the choice becomes equal in a democracy
 loktantr ke kilaaf harakatein hone lagati hai
 The voice of the public starts getting suppressed, in this situation you would have seen that political parties are insisting on making members instead of workers
 wo aapke raajnneetikaran kaa partykaran karnaa chaahate hai
 That is why Hindu communalism and Muslim communalism are encouraged so that you may get annoyed but it becomes difficult for you to change your face
 isliye ab is loktantr main janata hameshaa haaregi
 If she wants to be happy with the voting percentage then it should be
 usee tarah congress na to apane sawaalon par tiki rah saki na sushamaa ke sawaalon kaa jawaab de saki

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has so far considered the Congress to be its main opponent in the Lok Sabha or Assembly elections
 ab tak narendra modi apane chunavi bhaashanon main congress ke netaaon or nitiyon par hi sawaal khadey karte aae hai lekin ravivaar ko goa main pehali baar modi ne aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal ko bhi apane virdohi kheme main shaamil kar liya
 Perhaps now Modi has also agreed that the contest is going to be triangular in 2014
 ab siyaasi kurukshetra main teesraa maharathi bhi saamne khadaa ho chukaa he
 The name is Arvind Kejriwal
 ohada he dilli ke mukhyamantri kaa or party he aap yani aam aadmi party
 It was Narendra Modi's election rally in Goa and for the first time in this rally, Modi took the Congress as well as the Aam Aadmi Party and the party's biggest face Arvind Kejriwal under the radar of his brainchild and tongue
 desh ko televijan kii screen par cheharaa chahie yaa dharti par vijandilli ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad se hi arvind kejariwal or unki sarkaar ne har roj aisa kuch kiya he jisase wo khabaron kii surkhiyon main barkaraar hai
 Perhaps because of AAP, Modi has started to fear his diminishing importance in the world of news
 lihaaja govi kii raily main ye sawaal sidhaa desh kii janata ke saamne daag diya
 Narendra Modi said, 'now the nation has to decide whether it will be good for the country by appearing on television or it will be better to see the vision on earth
 desh ko televijan kii screen par cheharaa chahie yaa dharti par vijan chahie
 'the media people don't see anything outside Delhi
 Modi's attack on Kejriwal was a little more straightforward and sharp
 is baar nishaanaa bana kejariwal or unki sarkaar kii wo saadagi jise mudda banaakar aam aadmi party ne dilli main chunaav ladaa or modi ne hathiyaar banaaya
 The lifestyle of Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar
 unhone kaha, 'kalpana kiijie goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar agar dilli main hote to kya hota
 The whole country would know that there is so much simplicity in such a educated person
 lekin kya karen vah goa main hai dilli main nahin
 Media people do not see anything outside Delhi
 'goa main modi ke bhaashan main is baar congress gaun ho gai thi or kejariwal ahm
 Perhaps the reason for the increasing popularity of the Aam Aadmi Party across the country may also be
 ek taaja survey main ye khulaasa hua he ki 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ko 50 se 60 siton par vijay hasil ho sakati he
 If the country has to move forward, a new thought is needed, in which Kejriwal will definitely become a kingmaker if he is not even a king
 haalanki modi ne to goa main yahi kaha ki agar unhen jeet mil bhi jaati he to kya hua
 Where to get experience for running government and decisions? unhone kaha, 'desh ko aage badhanaa he to nai soch chahie
 Decisions are needed in a new way
 anubhav kii kasuti par kase hue log chahie
 Only then can India's fate change
 'media main hameshaa haara par janata ke dil main nahinhaalanki modi ne kisi haalia survey kaa zikr to apane bhaashan main nahin kiya lekin kejariwal par bounsar phenkate hue ye jarur kaha ki jeet ke liye jagah janata ke dilon main honi chahie na ki akhbaar ke panne yaa tivi ke screen par
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi said, there are many Navratnas in the country who live for the country

 In Bihar's Virpur police station area of begusarai district, the case of leaving a woman saying 'divorce' 3 times has come to light
 bataaya jaataa he ki mahila ne apane shuhar ko sharaab pine ke liye paise nahin die, jiske baad usne patni ko 'teen talaak' de diya
 The police has arrested the husband on charges of harassing his wife
 police ke anusaar, virpur pashchimi panchayat kii rahane vaali rubeda khatun kaa 22 saal purv mohammad shakeel se nikaah hua tha
 During this time Mohammad Shakeel got addicted to alcohol
 chah bacchon kii maa rubeda idhar-udhar kaam kar kisi tarah apane parivaar kaa bharan-poshan karti he
 But Shakeel often asked his wife for liquor money
 graminon kaa kahana he ki sharaab pine ke liye paise nahin dene par shakeel apni patni kii pitayee kiya karata tha
 As usual, on Tuesday, Shakeel demanded money from his wife
 jab usne paise nahin die to vah teen baar 'talaak' bolkar chalaa gaya
 After this, with the help of the local people, Rubeda appealed to the police for justice
 thana prabharee babulal ne bataaya ki rubeda ke bayaan par pati ke khilaaf pratadit karne ke aarope main virpur thana main praathmiki darj kar lee gai he
 The police arrested the accused Shakeel with immediate effect
 pulicepure maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 He said that the victim in her statement accused the husband of 'divorcing' her

 During a conversation with reporters late on Thursday night, Varun Gandhi said that he had full consideration for political limitations and would not use wrong words against anyone
 unhone kaha, "raajnneeti ko lekar mere andar ek sakaaratmak soch bani hui he or main hameshaa is baat main vishwaas karata hum ki kisi ko apni had paar nahin kerani chahie
 
 
 " gyaat ho ki rahul gandhi uttar pradesh kii amethi sansadeey seat se chunaav lard rahe hai, jabaki varun ko isi rajya kii sultanpur seat se chunaav ladaae jane kii sambhaavna he
 Varun Gandhi is currently an MP from Pilibhit, but this time he has expressed his desire to contest from Sultanpur
 varun kii maa menka gandhi aanwala loksabhaa seat se saansad hai or aisi atakalein hai ki loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main vah pilibhit se chunaav lard sakati hai, jahaan se vah varun ke saansad banane se pehle swayan saansad rah chuki hai

 '' is kaarykram main nitish ne apane bhaashan main mana ki pichley dinon patna police ke ek daaroga ne vaktavy diya ki thane main rakhi adhikansh sharaab chuuhe pi gaye
 After this statement, the state was severely enraged everywhere from social media to home and abroad
 iske baad unhone na keval thanon main rakhi sharaab ko nasht karne kaa aadesh diya balki police ko bhi sharaab ke avaidh kaarobaar main lage logon ke khilaaf abhiyaan tej karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Nitish said that now the police will have to keep the sample as evidence for the court before confiscating the liquor stock and then immediately destroy the seized liquor
 rajya main pichley ek saal ke dauraan nau lakh litre sharaab jabt kii gai
 Police is destroying it in every district

 Shocked by Katju's statement, Nitish Kumar said that not only outsiders but people of Bihar also make fun of Bihar
 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish markendeya katju ke vivaadit post se bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bahut hi aahat hai
 This can be gauged from the fact that Nitish Kumar again discussed it at a Bihar Police event in Patna on Wednesday and said that despite this Bihar is not worth mocking, people make fun of it
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apane andaaj main ek kaarykram main bolte hue kaha ki bahut log aise hai jo bihar kaa majaak udaate hai jabaki bihar majaak udaane laayak he nahin
 There is so much happening in Bihar that is worth knowing and worth learning
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki in sabake babajood bahut log hai jo kasam khaae hue hai
 He said that it is not only outsiders but also people here who have sworn that they will make fun of Bihar
 bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr unhone takalif bhare lahaze main kaha ki pataa nahin kya maansikta ho gayi he
 Sometimes i get surprised thinking about people with this kind of mindset
 katju ke fasebuk par bihar ke bare main likhe bayaan par jab susheel kumaar modi se patrakaron ne pratikriya lee to unhone katju par kuch nahin kaha or nitish kumaar ko hi iskaa jawaab dene ko kaha kyonki katju ne chaar maheene pehle nitish kumaar ko behatar pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar bataaya tha
 Nitish Kumar said that many people are engaged day and night in the image of Bihar to be tarnished
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne katju kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki kuch log bihar ke bare main kuch kaha to unako chaaro ore se acha khaasaa jawaab mil gaya
 Although Katju still did not stop, he advised the people of Bihar to file a complaint against him in the United Nations
 saath main udhaaharan bhi diya ki jis tarah se draupadi ke chiraharan ke samay bhagwaan krishna ne unki laaj rakhi thi shaayad usee tarah se yuan bhi bihar ke logon kii laaj rakhega
 Katju did not stop here, he also commented on Nitish Kumar's response on Tuesday, saying that i am not my father of Bihar
 main shakuni mamaa hum
 However, people of Bihar are showing their protest against Katju on social media
 patna ke shastrinagar thane main katju ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa mukadmaa jediu ke pravaktaa ne darj karaayaa he to patna civil court samet bihar ke kai court main katju ke khilaaf aaj bhi deshadroh kaa mukadedama darj hua he
 But political parties are not missing out on doing politics in this as well and perhaps this is the reason why Nitish Kumar had to say that not only outsiders but people of Bihar also enjoy making fun of Bihar

 Amid threats looming over the state-owned telecom company Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), Union Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that the government is taking services of Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad and US accounting firm Messrs Deloitte and BSNL and MTNL is preparing plans for restructuring and revival
 loksabhaa main prashnkaal ke dauraan saansad rama devi, rajeev pratav rudi, faruk abdulla or kuch anya netaaon ke poorak sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki in companiyon kii siforeeshon or board se manjuuri ke baad BSNL or mahanagar telephone nigam limited (MTNL) ko ghate se ubaarane ke liye ek vyapak rivival plan taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 BSNL and MTNL are going through tremendous crisis
 in companiyon kii haalat itani kharaab ho gai he ki inke paas selary dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 Many parties of the country have expressed concern over the health of these companies
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki telecom market main jabardast compitishan ke bich BSNL ko nijee companiyon ke mukaable barabari kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 Let us know that BSNL does not offer 4G services at this time
 isaki vajah se is company se lakhon graahak dur hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Lok Sabha, "when the 4G spectrum was being allocated, the public center companies were not involved at that time, because this would have sent the message that the government is supporting psus and other companies are not getting a chance to equalize
 , But now after the needs of the market and competition, we can think about 4G
 "ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki BSNL or MTNL kaa karmchaariyon kaa vetan kaa kharch nijee companiyon ke mukaable kai guna zyada he
 He said that the staff cost of BSNL was 75 of the total income
 06 pratishat he or emtnael ke liye aankada 87
 15 percent
 unhone kaha ki nijee companiyon kii employi laagat 2 se 5 pratishat ke bich he
 The Union Minister said in a written reply in Parliament, "the stiff competition in the mobile segment has led to difficulties for BSNL and MTNL, besides loss of these government companies in the data-centric market due to high employee costs and lack of 4G services
 Is falling doorsanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki beasenel or emtnael jaisi sarkari kshetra kii doorsanchaar companiyon kaa swasth rahanaa deshhit main he tathaa sarkaar inaki sthiti ko behatar banane ke liye puure prayaas kar rahi he
 He said that competition from private companies has increased in the telecom sector
 bijli ke tarriff ko lekar dilli sarkaar or bijli companiyon main thanane ke asaar najar aa rahe hai
 Companies have sent answers to the government's question
 jawaab main kaha gaya he ki companiyon ke audit kaa maamla dilli hoicourt main chal rahaa he
 In such a situation, the decision of the court should be awaited, haste is not good
 udhar, mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal apane vaadon ke anusaar is faisle par adig hai ki bijli companiyon kaa audit karavaaya jayega
 In the same case, Kejriwal also met the CAG on Tuesday
 ab chunki maamla dilli hoicourt main he or sarkaar ne companiyon par kisi tarah kaa dawaab banaaya to companiyaan court bhi ja sakati hai
 The court's response will then become important
 2012 main ek enjio ne dilli main bijli vitaran karne vaali companiyon kaa audit kiye jane kii maang kii thi
 Since then, this matter is going on in the Delhi High Court
 companiyon ne sarkaar ko jo jawaab diya he, usamen kaha gaya he ki is cese main kai sunwaayee ho chuki hai or adaalat ke aadesh aane hi vaale hai
 Till then should be waited
 yadi adaalat audit ke liye kahegi, to companiyaan audit karaane ko taiyaar hongi
 In addition, power companies have started exploring alternatives
 kanoonee vikalpon ke istemaal par bhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 What can happen now, although there is a case in court, but the government is free to audit the power companies
 sarkaar audit kaa faisla le sakati he
 Yes, since the matter is in court, if the government does not take any decision on it morally, then it will be its will

 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi modi ne gujarat ke vikaas ko mudda banaaya tha
 But during the ongoing assembly elections in Gujarat, the Congress has been consistently describing the development of Gujarat as an illusion
 piem modi ne bhi somvaar ko apni raily main vikaas ke mudde par virodhiyon ko jawaab diya tha
 He had said that while being the CM of Gujarat, i used to organize Krishi Mahotsav every year in which the entire government staff including the Chief Minister used to visit villages and give information about modern technology to farmers
 kya yashambani-adani, tata-birlake liye tha yaa desh ke garib kisaanon ke liye tha? saath hi modi ne ye bhi kaha tha ki wo kal vikaas kii jhalak dikhaaenge

 ye gaanaa saal 1966 main relies hui film "johar in kashmir" kaa he
 The viral post archived version can be viewed here
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne padtaal main paaya ki viral ho rahi post ke saath kiya gaya daawa bhraamak he
 In this song, the censor board did not ban, but asked to remove some words
 fasebuk pej"azamgarh Express"ne ye gaanaa aplod karte hue capshan main likhaa: "sunen mohammad rafee kii aawaaj main ye geet jo kabhi relies nahin ho paaya
 Fifty years ago this song was cut by the censors! But why? "by the time the news was written, this post had been shared more than 2600 times whereas 50 thousand people have seen it
 fasebuk yujar"shanif malik"or"zafar Shaikh"jaise bahut se logon ne bhi isi daawey ke saath is gane ko aplod kiya he

 There was a farmer strike all over Maharashtra on Monday
 in kisaanon kii maang vahi he jisase sarkaar batch rahi he
 Farmers want the government to guarantee the price by adding fifty taka of profit to the cost
 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main yahi vaada kiya tha
 Not only this, all the debts of the farmers are forgiven
 ek maheenaa pehle ahmednagar ke gaanv kuntamba kii gramsabha main ye prastaav paas kiya tha
 Gradually, resolutions began to be passed in gram sabhas in many villages of Maharashtra and there was a fierce farmer strike in Maharashtra from June 1
 iske tahat kisaanon ne shaharon ko fal, doodh or sabzi kii supplai roak di
 The news came in the middle that the strike has been broken, but Dr
 Ajit Navale of the Coordination Committee of this strike said that the strike is on
 madhya pradesh main bhi kisaanon ne isi tarah kii strike kii he
 There is news of the end of the strike
 vahaan bhi kisaan puch rahe hai ki mandi main hamen ek rupee kilo pyaaj kaa daam miltaa he usee ko ham bazaar se bees rupee kilo kharidte hai
 Why is this happening
 daawey ke saath to nahin kah saktaa magar shaayad hi koi channel kisaanon ke paksh main khadaa hua hoga, sarkaar se poocha hoga ki teen saal ho gaye, aapane vaada kiya tha ki utpaadan laagat main pachaas fisadi munafa jod kar daam denge, wo daam kab denge
 Whenever such a voice comes, other issues are raised in front of the national media
 sena ke masale par charchaa hone se aap shaq bhi nahin karenge ki kisaanon ke masale par charchaa roki gai he
 Would you also like to discuss the issue of the army itself, but likewise everyday questions related to the common man are excluded from the national media
 ek vyakti ko lekar ghanton charchaa hoti he lakhon kisaanon ko lekar ek ghanta bhi bahes nahin hoti he
 So it is important for you to know what is happening in the media
 bahut se logon ne whatsap kar bataaya he ki ve samaj rahe hai ki is khel ke zariye kise daraaya ja rahaa he
 Yogendra Yadav, Siddharth Bhatia, Haratosh Singh Bal, MK Venu, Rajdeep Sardesai, Shoaib Daniyal, Praneev Swamy, Om Thanvi, Ramchandra Guha, Ajay Shukla, these are the people who have been writing in public space on all issues 
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi is chhapemari ko daraane kii karrwai bataaya he
 General viewers from across the country have also tweeted
 venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki agar koi media main he, galat kaam karata he, to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki sarkaar chup baithegi, adhikari apana kaam kar rahe the or usamen koi raajnneetik hastkshep nahin he
 The comments enditivi ne apana jawaab de diya he
 The CBI went on a raid on the complaint of the person on whose complaint the courts of the country did not take cognizance, while the promoter of NDTV has clearly said that the loan which was meant for it has been repaid
 vaise kanoon ko yaad dilaanaa chahie ki chah lakh karod kaa jo non parfarming asset he bainkon kaa, uske liye bhi kuch kaam karne kii zarurat he
 However, this attack is on you
 aaj yah hamalaa nahin hota to main wo karata jiske bare main shanivaar se soch rahaa tha
 You know that the two big states of India, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are carrying out the peasant movement
 puure maharashtra main somvaar ke din kisaan strike thi
 The demand of these farmers is the same from which the government is avoiding
 kisaan chaahate hai ki jitani laagat he usamen pachaas taka munafa jod kar daam dene kii guarantee de sarkaar
 This is what the BJP promised in its manifesto
 yaheen nahin kisaanon ke saare karze maaf hon
 a month ago, this proposal was passed in the village meeting of village Kuntamba in Ahmednagar
 dhire dhire maharashtra ke kai gaanvon kii gram sabhaaon main prastaav paas hone lage or ek june se maharashtra main bhayankar kisaan strike hui
 Under this, the farmers stopped the supply of fruits, milk and vegetables to the cities
 bich main khabar ai ki hadtaal tut gai he magar is strike ke koordination cameti ke doctor ajit navle ne kaha ki strike chaalu he
 Farmers have also done a similar strike in Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan hadtaal ke samaapt hone kii khabar he
 There too, farmers are asking that in the market we get one rupee a kg of onion, that is what we buy from the market for twenty rupees a kg
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 Can't say with the claim, but hardly any channel would have stood in favor of the farmers, it would have asked the government that it has been three years, you promised that by adding 50% profit in the cost of production, when will they give the price? 
 jab bhi aisi awaz aati he, neshnal media ke saamne duusare masale khadey kar diye jate hai
 You will not doubt that the discussion on the issue of farmers has been stopped due to the discussion on the army issue
 aap kya ham bhi chahenge ki sena ke masale par hi charchaa ho magar isi tarah rose aam aadmi se jude sawaal rashtriya media se baahar kar diye jate hai
 There is a discussion about a person for hours, there is not an hour of debate on millions of farmers
 isliye aapke liye jaananaa zaruri he ki media main kya ho rahaa he
 NDTV has given its answer
 jis vyakti kii shikaayat par desh kii adaalaton ne sangyaan nahin liya, us vyakti kii shikaayat par sibiai chaape maarane chali ai jabaki enditivi ke pramotor ne saaf kaha he ki jis lone kii baat thi, wo lone chukaa diya gaya he
 By the way, the law should remind that the banks, which are non-performing assets of six lakh crores, also need to do some work for it
