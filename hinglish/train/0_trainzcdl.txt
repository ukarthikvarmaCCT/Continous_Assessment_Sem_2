 ' Republican Party of India (RPI) activists ransacked the office of NCERT advisor Suhas Palshikar in Pune on Saturday after a controversy erupted in a school text-book over a cartoon raid on constitution maker BR Ambedkar
 palshikar haalanki ek din purv hi pad se istipha de chuke hai
 Police detained three people in connection with the vandalism
 pune vishvavidhyalay parisar ke ek bhawan kii pehali manzil par sthit palshikar ke karyaalay par lagbhag 10 log pahunch gaye or unke tathaa ensiiarti (rashtriya shaikshik anusandhan evam prashikshan parishad) ke khilaaf naare lagaae
 They entered the office and broke furniture and sprayed blue powder
 is dauraan palshikar ko haalanki chot nahin lagi
 Police arrested three people in connection with this attack
 arpiai netaa parashuram wadekar ne bataaya, "kaaryakartaaon ne palshikar ke karyaalay par hamalaa isliye kiya, kyonki unhone ambedkar kaa apmaan kar gunaah kiya tha
 " vahiin palshikar ne kaha ki unhone todphod karne waalon ke khilaaf koi shikaayat darj nahin karai he
 This issue is being given unnecessarily political color
 unhone sawaal kiya, "yah maamla pehali baar 2006 main saamne aayaa tha
 Why was nothing done at that time, now why is it being sensationalized? " gyaat ho ki vyangy chitrakaar shankar kaa banaaya yah vivaadaaspad cartoon pehali baar 1949 main unki saptahik patrika main chapa tha

 cartoon main ambedkar ko ek ghonghe par baithe dikhaaya gaya he jinhen tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru samvidhan nirmaan ke kaary main teji laane kaa nirdesh de rahe hai
 Palshikar described the cartoon as rational and said there was nothing wrong with it
 kitaab main iskaa samavesh isliye kiya gaya ki chaatr yah acchhee tarah samaj saken ki us samay samvidhan ke nirmaan kii kitni besabri se pratiksha kii ja rahi thi
 The comments palshikar pune vishvavidhyalay ke raajnneeti vigyaan vibhaag ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 He resigned as an advisor to the NCRT on Friday after an uproar in Parliament over the cartoon issue
 ullekhneey he ki kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne shuukravaar ko sansad main kaha tha ki is vivaad ke liye haalanki vah jimmedaar nahin hai, phir bhi raashtra se kshamaa maangane main unhen koi hichkichaahat nahin he
 About 10 people reached Palshikar's office on the first floor of a building in Pune University campus and raised slogans against him and NCERT (national Council of Educational Research and Training)
 unhone karyaalay main ghuskar furniture tod die or nile rang ke powder chhidak die
 During this time Palshiker did not get hurt though
 is hamale ke silsile main police ne teen logon ko hiraasat main le liya
 RPI leader Parshuram Wadekar said, "the activists attacked Palshikar's office because they had committed the crime by insulting Ambedkar
" " At the same time, Palshikar said that he has not filed any complaint against the vandalists

 But if he stays in Parliament as a member of the party, then Arvind Kejriwal will be able to control his activities in Parliament through whip

 The Commission has raised the question whether Badal was so helpless that he agreed to the proposal to use force to picket? If the DGP spoke to the district administration and Mantar Brar, then obviously the Chief Minister would have already talked to the DGP in this regard

 On April 2, Saturn and Mars will come in Sagittarius at exactly the same degree
 jyotish main mangal ko krur or shani ko paap grah kaha gaya he
 According to Brihat Samhita, when there is a planetary war in Mars and Saturn, there is war between the kings and those who bear arms suffer

 The planet whose degree is less is considered to be won in the war and the planet which has higher degree in both of them is defeated in the war

 Along with this, it was also believed that in the condition of the planet Khal, humans have extreme physical and mental distress

 The combination of Saturn and Mars will have a bad effect on these zodiac signs, representing the backward Dalit and afflicted side of the society
 unhen nyaay kaa devtaa kaha jaataa he
 Shani's role in judicial matters is also considered important
 yah maamla bhi nyaayalay ke faisle ke baad uthaa he
 This resentment has emerged from the close association of Mars and Saturn among Dalit and backward classes

 Saturn is considered to be the planet representing Vayu

 In such a situation, this combination of representative planets of fire and wind can spread more quickly

 It is also worth considering here that both these planets are together in the Leo sign in the Navamsha Chakra

 The government then faced disruptions among the majority of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha
 haalanki raashtrapati mukherjee ne sarkaar ke raste main koi baadha nahin khadi kii lekin is tathy se use avgat kara diya ki adhyadesh jari karne main sarkaar kii simit shakti he, saath hi kaaryakari aadesh sabase antim vikalp hona chahie
 Similarly, NEET ordinance was sent to President Mukherjee in May 2016, which empowered states to conduct their own medical entrance examinations
 mukherjee ne tab apni kanoonee team, swasthya mantri je pi nadda, atorni general mukul rohtagi or swasthya mantralay ke adhikariyon ko vimarsh ke liye bulaayaa
 The President took two days
 saath hi sarkaar se poocha ki itani jaldi kyon he
 The President also asked that once the ordinance comes into force, what will happen to the current admission process
 raashtrapati ne swasthya mantri se adhyadesh par sthiti saaf karne ko kaha
 Asked why states were excluded
 raashtrapati ne vitt mantri arun jetali ko beemaa adhyadesh par saman kiya tha
 Explain that the NDA government was introducing the insurance ordinance as its first big ticket reform step
 raashtrapati mukherjee ne kuch maheene baad jameen adhigrahan bill ke tamaam pahaluon par bhi sarkaar ke saath charchaa kii
 In December last year, the government sent the controversial Enemy Property Ordinance as the bill was stuck in the Parliamentary Committee on the same issue
 mukherjee ne tab apane kanoonee visheshgyon kii team ko bulaayaa or sarkaar se spashtikaran dene ko kaha
 His objection was simple - the ordinance is a substitute settlement and extending the executive order, which requires parliament's approval, for the fifth time would be like weakening the parliamentary system
 mukherjee ke is rukh par vitt mantri arun jetali raashtrapati bhawan kii ore daude, jaisaa ki ve pehle bhi kai baar kar chuke the
 Jaitley explained why the ordinance is necessary
 raashtrapati chaahate to sanvidhanik praavdhaan ke tahat cabinet kii ore se paas adhyadesh ko lautaa sakate the, vaisaa kadam jaisaa ki raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ne bhi apane kaarykaal main ek baar uthaaya tha
 But Mukherjee thought it better to avoid the confrontation because he knew that the government had the power to pass the ordinance and send it back to them
 agar aisa hota to raashtrapati ke paas cabinet kii sifarish ko manjuur karne ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin hota
 Sources close to Mukherjee say that the president was theoretically not in favor of returning the cabinet decisions for the purpose of making them publicly visible
 aisi hi ek sthiti janvari 2016 main bhi bani thi
 The central government had decided to impose Arunachal Pradesh President's Rule in political turmoil
 raashtrapati aashwast nahin the ki kyon centre sarkaar anuchhed 356 kaa istemaal karnaa chaahati he
 Then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh met President Mukherjee and cited the reasons for this recommendation
 raashtrapati bhawan sutron ke mutabik raashtrapati mukherjee jab puri tarah santusht ho gaye ki rajya sanvidhanik sankat kaa saamana kar rahaa he, tabhi unhone hastakshar kiye
 Although political observers believe that President Mukherjee did not publicly allow moments of confrontation with the government in public, he gave a firm message to the government at the right time, whenever it felt necessary
 pichley kuch maheenon main teen baar unhone spasht or nishchit raay vyakt kii
 During the protests in several educational institutions, the President spoke in favor of freedom of expression
 isi saal may main unhone ek smriti bhaashan ke dauraan apni purv bos indira gandhi kii khulkar prashansa kii
 Mukherjee said, "she was an extraordinary figure in the 20th century for the people of the whole world and India
 unke duniya se alavida kehane ke baad bhi aaj tak wo ek loktantric desh kii sarvaadhik sweekaarya shaasha yaa pradhanmantri hai
 "in the context of incidents of beating up people on behalf of the mob in the last two years in the country, Mukherjee said last Saturday," Are we so vigilant as to protect the core values of our time? main maanata hum ki logon or media kii satarkta andhere or pichhadepan kii shaktiyon ke khilaaf sabase bada pratirohak sabit ho sakati hai
 "president Mukherjee also said that" no one can abdicate one's duty regarding this issue
 aane vaali peedi hamase jawaab maangi ki hamane kya kiya
 i ask myself this question
 "haalanki sutron ne ye bhi kaha ki pranab mukherjee bhinn kaaryastylee vaale pradhanmantri jo dilli ke liye apekshaakrit nae the, ke saath kaam karne ke liye sambhavat: sabase uparyukt raashtrapati the
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi credited the 'presidential help' for settling Delhi quickly after coming from Gujarat
 sarkaar main ek varisht mantri ke mutabik raashtrapati mukherjee raajnneetik taur par itane daksh hai, samvidhan kii aavashyaktaaon ko lekar itane avgat hai, nitiyon ko lekar itane jaankaar hai ki endie ke kai mantriyon korashtrapati bhavanjaanaa hameshaa sukhad lagata
 The minister said, "there is no issue that they have not dealt with in the past
 aise shaks jinhone may 2014 takaupie sarkaarake kareeb 80 mantrimandaleey samoohon kii adhyakshata kii
 They are like Encyclopaedia for references

 dilli police kii giraft main aae serial repist sunil rastogi par 700 se zyada bacchiyon ke saath rape karne kaa aarope he, lekin dilli police ke disipi (east) omveer singh media main chal rahi in khabaron ko saraasar galat bataa rahe hai
 Speaking to the media, DCP Omvir Singh said that the reports of Sunil raping 500 or 700 are completely false
 disipi ne kaha, police kii kai team is maamle kii jaanch main juty hai
 Police have got a record of five incidents against Sunil so far in Delhi and 8 in UP and Uttarakhand
 sunil ne police ko bataaya ki uske parivaar main patni or 4 bachche hai
 Her eldest daughter is 17 years old and the second daughter is 15 years old
 teesri beti ke alaava uskaa ek betaa he
 Sunil reveals that he has done two marriages
 apni shaadiyon se pehle hi usne bacchiyon ke saath rape jaisi sangeen vaaradaaten karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Daughters can be questioned
 Police can also question Sunil's daughters
 serial repistasunil se poochtacha ke dauraan police adhikari is nattejey par pahunche he ki vah ek pideophile psico he
 DCP Omvir Singh said while talking about the strategy created to nab the serial rapist, four teams were formed to trace the serial sexual offenders
 khangala aparaadhiyon kaa purana ricardhar team main 8 pulicekarmi the
 The team started in Delhi, some states of UP and Uttarakhand
 team ne un logon ke bare main pataa lagaaya jo kuch maheenon yaa saal main bacchiyon se rape ke aarope main giraftaar kiye gaye ho
 In fact, Sunil Rastogi was arrested in the year 2006 with the girl in the case of attempted rape
 us dauraan use 6 maheene kii sajaa bhi hui thi
 The victim identified the accused after watching CCTV and the minor victim of the rape in New Ashok Nagar area of delhi identified the accused in the CCTV footage
 ab sisitivi footage ke saath-saath sunil kii profile bhi police ke hathe lag chuki thi
 Finally, after more than a month of rigorous homework, the police succeeded and serial rapist Sunil was arrested from Kondli area of delhi
 schuli bacchiyon ko banaata tha nishanagauratlab he ki serial repist sunil ne pichley 12 saal se bacchiyon ke saath rape karne kii baat kabool kii
 She told the police that she was targeted by school girls, who were going home alone
 vah bacchiyon ko bahaane se apane saath le jaataa or phir kisi sunsaan jagah par unhen apni havas kaa shikaar banaata tha
 Currently, serial rapist Sunil has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days
 bihar kii jin saat siton par 24 april ko matdaan hua, unamem se arriya, katihaar, purniya or bhagalpur kii chaar siten 2009 main bijepi ke khate main gai thim
 Then JD (U) of Nitish Kumar added Supaul seat to nda's account
 nirdaleey ummidavaar digvijay singh baankaa se jite the to congress ko kishanganj kii ek seat se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 But the equations have changed completely in the last five years
 2009 main saath-saath chunaav ladgaye vaali bijepi or jediu aaj katu dushman ho gaye hai to pichhali baar ke vipareet is baar argedy or congress ne haath mila liya he
 But the question is, will this have any effect on the results? Araria, Purnia and Katihar are in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal area of bihar
 jabaki bhagalpur bhi jansankhya ke ghatak or matdaan vyavhaar ke lihaaj se kaaphi had tak simanchal jaisaa hi he
 However, the nda's tremendous performance in these seats in 2009 was made possible because JD (U) and BJP fought together
 unke gathjod se ati pichhadaa varg or savarna jatiyon ke log ek saath jud gaye the
 The icing on the gold was the additional vote of the minorities that the United NDA gained
 lekin is baar inke bich ke khattey rishte ne vot bank ko bhi baant diya he jisase lalu prasad yadav ke liye avasaron kii khidki khulti dikh rahi he
 While the first two phases of the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar are considered good for the BJP, the third phase elections held on April 24 will test whether Narendra Modi really has influence in Bihar or not
 is charan ke nattejey yah bhi sabit karenge ki lalu kii bihar kii raajnneeti main vaapasi ho paati he yaa nahin
 The situation seems to be that due to Modi, polarization of important Muslim votes is happening in favor of a party which is capable of defeating BJP
 duusari taraf bijepi se alag hone ke baad jedy (you) se savarna vot chhitak gaye hai
 The congress-rjd alliance led by Lalu is hopeful that the BJP-JD (U) alliance will improve their performance
 argedy ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ‘‘2009 main jedy (you)-bijepi saath milakar lade the jabaki congress or argedy alag-alag tathaa ek-duusare ke khilaaf the
 Now BJP and JD (U) have split, while Congress and RJD have joined hands
 ab hamaari vaapasi kaa samay he
 In these seats, the BJP reiterated the trust of its four sitting mps and fielded them again
 2009 main bhagalpur se shahanvaj hossain, purniya se udai singh (pappu), katihaar se nikhil choudhary or arriya se pradeep singh aasaani se jeet gaye the
 But this time there is a triangular contest on all four seats
 unhen ab bas yahi ummid he ki modi kii lahar un alpsankhyak voton kii bharpai kar degi jo unhen 2009 main hasil hue the
 But there is uncertainty on this
 muslim bahul arriya main argedy ke puraane yoddha mohammad taslimuddin bijepi ke pradeep singh ko kadi takkar de rahe hai
 For two more sitting mps of the BJP, Uday Singh and Nikhil Chaudhary, the contest is tough this time
 ye un kuch siton main se hai jahaan jedy (you) ummidavaaron kii bijepi se kaante kii takkar he
 The results will only show whether Uday Singh meets the challenge being faced by JD (U) 's Santosh Kushwaha and Congress' Amarnath Tiwari
 2009 main mahaj 14,000 voton se jeetne vaale nikhil choudhary ek baar phir rashtravaadi congress party ke ummidavaar tarik anwar se kadi takkar paa rahe hai jinhen argedy or congress kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 The advantage for Tariq is that Katihar has 42 per cent Muslim voters
 bijepi ke muslim cheharaa shahanvaj hossain bhi bhagalpur main argedy ke bulo mandal ke saath kathin mukaable main funs gaye hai
 Mandal's candidature is considered to be the trump card of Lalu Prasad, who has tried to form a Muslim, Yadav and Gangota alliance by ticketing a candidate from the Gangota caste who is a part of the upper castes, Banias and the Backward Class (EBC) of BJP May be overshadowed by support
 isi tarah baankaa main 2010 main vahaan se nirdaleey jeetne vaali putul kumari is baar bijepi kii tikat par lard rahi hai jinhen argedy ke jai prakaash narayan yadav or sipii ke santosh kumaar se kade mukaable kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Putul is also hoping to cross his boat in the confidence of Modi wave
 vaise baankaa main muslim aabaadi utani zyada nahin he, jaisaa ki simanchal ke jilon main he, lekin vahaan bijepi kaa koi sanghathanaatmak aadhaar nahin he
 This is one of the few seats where BJP did not contest due to alliance with JD (U) in last 17 years
 jaahir he, in siton par bijepi kii raah mushkil he or modi kii raah aasaan nahin rahegi
 On the other hand, in the four seats for which elections have been held in Jharkhand, the most important battle is in Dumka where JMM chief and sitting MP Shibu Soren is facing possibly the toughest election of his life
 jharkhand ke teen baar mukhyamantri rahe sorain is seat ko bachaane kii koshish main lage hai jahaan unhen do tagade ummidavaar jharkhand ke pehle mukhyamantri babulal marandi or bijepi ke sunil sorain kadi chunauti de rahe hai
 Shibu has contested Lok Sabha elections from Dumka nine times and won seven of these
 lekin 2009 main ve bal-bal bache the jab unhen 2,08,518 vot mili the or bijepi ke sunil sorain 1,89,706 voton ke saath unke bahut kareeb pahunch gaye the
 Sunil is trying to win from Dumka, riding on Modi's wave this time
 duusari taraf, babulal marandi dumka se chaar baar loksabhaa chunaav lard chuke hai
 He has lost to Shibu Soren twice and has won twice, once against Soren and once against his wife Rupi Soren
 jharkhand ke in donon adivasee nayakon kaa samarthan aadhaar ek hi he, isse yah samajha ja saktaa he ki aakhir donon ek-duusare ke itane katu virdohi kyon hai
 Born in Ramgarh district, Shibu moved to Santhal Pargana in the 1960s to lead the fight against exploitative moneylenders
 jald hi vah pradesh kii sabase durjey takat ban gaye
 On the other hand, Marandi from Giridih was sent by the RSS in the 1980s to strengthen the branches in Santhal Pargana
 shibu jahaan bujurg ho chuke hai vahiin unke putr hemanth sorain jharkhand main alokapriy sarkaar kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, Marandi is seeing an opportunity to snatch Santhal Parganas from the hands of JMM in this election
 dumka main jo bhi jitegaa, use vidhansabha chunaavon main phayda milegaa
 On April 24, after the end of polling in four Lok Sabha seats Dhanbad, Godda, Rajmahal and Dumka, all the phases of general elections in the state have been completed
 jharkhand kii 14 loksabhaa siton ke liye hue chunaav aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye bhi ek sanket honge, jo ki isi saal hone vaale hai
 The bomb with which a Russian Metrojet aircraft was shot down in Sinai, Egypt, with 224 passengers this month, is nothing new to the experts of the Indian Army's Bomb Disposal Squad
 
 
 is tarah ke bam ko sabase pehle jammu evam kashmir main lagbhag do dashak pehle dekha gaya tha, jab iskaa rup 'soda can' kaa tha
 
 
 Assembling this improvised explosive device (IED) is very easy to assemble, and has the same effect as a hand grenade if it contains a plastic explosive like a kilo RDX
 
 
 kisi aadhunik vimaan ke udate vakt hawa kaa jo dabaav rahata he, vah 'soda can bam' ko kahin adhik ghaatak bana detaa he
 
 
 Its explosion in the aircraft will not only break the airframe, causing the cabin to de-compress, and suffocate the passengers, but it will also cause so much damage to the structure of the aircraft that the plane will fall down
 
 
 jammu ke nazadik akhnur main sena ke bam-nirodhak daste ke mukhyalay main 'soda can bam' ke alaava kai iidi rakhe hue hai
 
 
 None of these actually look like bombs, and these include items such as teddy bears, dolls, bouquets, four bottles of cold drinks, wrapped mattresses
 
 
 inamen se kisi ko zaraa-sa bhi apni jagah se hilaaiye, or syran baj uthegaa
 
 
 If it were real, you would have been torn to pieces, because then no siren would ring, just explode
 
 
 uttari cmand ke is daste ke prabharee leftinent karnal en
 Rocheyan (lieutenant Colonel n
 Roshyan) ne bataaya, "yah chuuhe-billi ke khel jaisaa hota he
 
 
 "according to him, tackling plastic explosives like RDX is a big challenge
 
 
 unhone kaha, "yah vazan main halke hote hai
 
 
 They can be molded into any shape, and are difficult to identify as bombs, making them the preferred weapon of terrorists
 
 
 " 
 
 
 or iidi ko pahchaan paanaa mushkil hota he, yah baat sabit karne ke liye mujhase us jagah (jo darasal kisi bhi rihaayshi ilaake main bane park jaisi dikhti he) tahalne ke liye kaha gaya
 
 
 But in fact, it is not a park, an improvised exploitative device range
 
 
 jaise hi main ek bairicade ke paar gaya, alarm baj uthaa
 
 
 Actually i had crossed the infra-red sensor
 
 
 yah kisi bam se judaa ho saktaa tha, jo turant hi fat gaya hota
 
 
 In the guard room located a few feet away, i was asked to sign the guest book, but as soon as i opened the book, the alarm rang again
 
 
 ab tak mere liye is alarm kaa arth samajhnaa kaaphi aasaan ho chukaa tha
 
 
 While walking in the park, my foot fell on something resembling a stone, but that too turned out to be a landmine
 
 
 maine ise pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha, or sach kahen to jisane kabhi badakismati se asli surang par paanv rakhaa hoga, dekh to vah bhi nahin paaya hoga
 
 
 There are many such examples here, from which it can be clearly understood that anything can be a bomb, and just being alert is not enough
 
 
 do dashakon se bhi zyaada vakt main hamaari sena ne yah jaan-samaj liya he - aksar iske liye baari keemat chukaakar - ki improwised explosive divaais kitna khatarnaak or ghaatak ho saktaa he, or yah bhi ki sabase badhiya tareeke se prashikshit logon kii tej nigahon se bhi aksar inhen pahchaan paanaa mushkil hota he
 
 
 In today's era, our army has started using many types of techniques to avoid the threat of IED
 
 
 tadake hi sadakon kii padtaal karne nikal jane vaali faujee team khaastaur par iidi, barudi surangen, or zamin ke neeche chhipe pani ke pipon main isi tarah ke bamon ko hi khojati hai
 
 
 Such bombs can also be flown through remote control, and it is possible that its wires are connected to a trigger, which is hidden by a terrorist in hand
 
 
 in iidi ko timaron se bhi joda ja saktaa he, jinhen 100-100 din baad tak bhi fatne ke liye program kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 According to Lieutenant Colonel Roshyan, "over the past two decades, we have changed our practice methods and operating procedures according to need
 
 
 hamane zaruuraton ko samajhate hue zaruri upkaran bhi hasil kiye hai
 
 
 We also make changes in our training process according to time and need
 
 
 " For the soldiers who are on patrol in an area where the IED is suspected to be hidden, security is provided in several layers
 
 
 sabase aage rahete hai soonghney vaale kute - jabardast prashikshan paae labrador ritreaver yaa german shefrd (labrador Retrievers or German Shepards) - jo apane prashikshakon ke ishaaron par pehle se tay gati or tareeke se kaam karte hai
 
 
 Each of these dogs has been trained in the Remount Veterinary Corps of the Army at Meerut
 
 
 in kutton kaa prashikshan kaarykram bhi lagaataar jari rahata he
 
 
 Dogs of each squad are also given a refresher course every few weeks to keep their mind alert, and to adapt themselves to the changing environment and circumstances
 
 
 training range main meri mulaakaat paanch-varsh ke dante (dante) naamak labrador ritreaver se karwaai gai
 
 
 Dante is considered one of the finest dogs in the Northern Command to find an IED, and its nose is said to have saved many lives
 
 
 main dante or uske prashikshak ke saath ek farji bas stop tak gaya, jahaan achaanak dante thithak gaya, or chupchaap baith gaya
 
 
 He had found something
 
 
 uske prashikshak ne paas main hi rakhe ek bistar ko uthaakar dekha, or hamen katai hairaani nahin hui, jab vahaan ek visphotak mila
 
 
 The military team that accompanies these dogs, which investigates the streets, carries a jammer in a backpack loaded on their back, allowing the remote control signals used to trigger an IED
 Can be made useless
 
 
 anya ilaakon main jamaron ko pehle se tay jagahon par tainaat kar diya jaataa he
 
 
 By the way, jammers are also used in military vehicles
 
 
 haalanki sena jamaron kii kuch khaas kshamtaaon ke bare main baat karne ke liye anicchhuk dikhi, lekin NDTV ko pataa chalaa he ki adhiktar jaimar alag-alag tarah ke kai mod main kaam kar sakate hai, jinamein 'pre-inishiation mod' bhi shaamil he, jiske tahat remote control se chalane vaali iidi ko aatankwaadiyon kii ore se signal milane se pehle sena khud hi uda sakati he
 
 
 There is only one sure way for the army to stay one step ahead of the terrorists - ensure that every radio frequency in the area is covered by jammers at all times
 
 
 prashikshan ke dauraan hamaara dekha-bhaalaa yah khel us samay puri tarah badal jaataa he, jab koi iidi mil jaataa he, or use naakaam yaa nasht kiya janaa hota he
 
 
 In the past, the bomb disposal squad used to go near the bomb and thwart it, but now our army prefers to use the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
 
 
 british wheelbaro arovi (british Wheelbarrow ROV) bydaree se chalati he, or is par lage camaron kii madad se iskaa sanchaalak iidi ko surakshit duuri par rahakar dekh paata he
 
 
 Wheelbarrows capable of weighing up to 75 kilograms are commonly used to overturn the corpses of terrorists, who often carry live hand grenades under their bodies immediately before dying in an encounter
 
 
 baad main laashon ko hataate vakt jaise hi suraksha bal aatankwaadi kii laash ko hilaate, hand grenade fat jaataa
 
 
 But now this does not happen
 
 
 ab agar visphot hota bhi he, to uskaa sara prabhaav hamaare faujee nahin, wheelbaro jaisi arovi jhelti hai
 
 
 In addition, the ROV also pulls out the hidden ieds from its mechanical claws, and also has a disrupter mechanism, which is actually a gun-like thing, which could not fail before the IED was damaged
 Throws at a distance
 
 
 lekin itnaa sab hone ke baavjood aise maukey bhi aate hai, jahaan bam-nirodhak daste ke techniciyanon, adhikariyon or phogiyon ko khud hi bam ke paas jaakar haathon se use naakaam karne kii koshish kerani padati he
 
 
 This is such a dangerous task, in which death can be defeated by living with life only with the help of focus, skill and strength
 
 
 chizon kii baarikiyon ko dekhne-samajhane, or gola-barood ko sanbhaalane kii kshamtaaon ke aadhaar par kariyar ke shuruaati daur main chune jane ke baad bam-nirodhak daste ke visheshgyon ko pune sthit college of military ejineering (college of Military Engineering) main prashikshan diya jaataa he
 
 
 These officers also participate in the Combined Officers Explosives Course - or immediately after being commissioned into the Army or within 10 years
 
 
 ek baar training mil jane ke baad inhen aatankwaad kaa saamana kar rahi uniton - jaise jammu evam kashmir main rashtriya rifles or deshbhar main tainaat vishesh counter explosive divaais unit (counter Explosive Device Units) - ke saath tainaat kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Wearing heavy protective bomb-resistant suits weighing up to 40 kilograms, these army technicians take special care of their chest, neck and head while they are lying on the ground next to the IED and looking at it
 
 
 inke paas kaam karne ke liye telescopy manipulator (telescopic manipulator) bhi hota he, jo vyakti tathaa iidi ke bich duuri banaae rakhata he, jab iidi ko chhipaai gai jagah se nikaala ja rahaa ho, lekin aakhirkaar bam ko naakaam karne ke liye maanviya anguliyaan hi zaruri hai, jo kisi aise shaks kii hon, jiskaa dimag bahut tezi se kaam karata ho
 
 
 Officers are also there to help these bomb technicians, who keep in constant contact with them over the radio
 
 
 takanisian ke helmet par lage camere kii madad se ek screen par adhikari vah sab dekhtaa rahata he, jo takanisian ko apane saamne dikhaai de rahaa he
 
 
 The comments inke liye ek-ek pal keemtee hota he
 
 
 These bomb technicians cannot work without weariness, because even though there is a system to keep them cool within their heavy suits, working continuously for more than half an hour at a time, especially in summer, would have been impossible
 is
 
 
 baharhaal, iidi ko talash karnaa or unhen naakaam karte rahanaa zindagi or maut kaa aisa kabhi nahin rukne vaala khel he, jo badalati takanic ke saath rose badalata rahata he
 
 
 These technicians of the anti-bomb squads know that if they want to keep themselves alive, they will have to succeed every time, otherwise only one success of terrorists can make them sleep forever

 In today's era, our army has started using many types of techniques to avoid the threat of IED
 
 
 tadake hi sadakon kii padtaal karne nikal jane vaali faujee team khaastaur par iidi, barudi surangen, or zamin ke neeche chhipe pani ke pipon main isi tarah ke bamon ko hi khojati hai
 
 
 Such bombs can also be flown through remote control, and it is possible that its wires are connected to a trigger, which is hidden by a terrorist in hand
 
 
 in iidi ko timaron se bhi joda ja saktaa he, jinhen 100-100 din baad tak bhi fatne ke liye program kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 According to Lieutenant Colonel Roshyan, "over the past two decades, we have changed our practice methods and operating procedures according to need
 
 
 hamane zaruuraton ko samajhate hue zaruri upkaran bhi hasil kiye hai
 
 
 We also make changes in our training process according to time and need

 In the wee hours of the morning, military teams, especially the ieds, minefields, and water pipes hidden under the ground, find similar bombs
 
 
 is tarah ke bamon ko remote control ke jariye bhi udaaya ja saktaa he, or yah bhi mumkin he ki uske taar kisi trigar se jude hon, jise haath main liye koi aatankwaadi kahi chhipakar baitha ho
 
 
 These ieds can also be connected to timers, which can be programmed to burst even after 100–100 days

 dante ko iidi khojane vaale uttari cmand ke behtareen kutton main shumaar kiya jaataa he, or kaha jaataa he ki isaki naak ne bahut-si jaanon ko bachaaya he
 
 
 i went with Dante and his trainer to a fake bus stop, where Dante suddenly stopped, and sat quietly
 
 
 use kuch mil gaya tha
 
 
 His trainer picked up a bed nearby, and we were not surprised when an explosive was found there
 
 
 in kutton ke saath chalane vaali faujee team, jo sadakon kii padtaal karti he, apni peeth par laden backpac (backpack - baste) main jaimar (jammer) lekar chalati he, jisase kisi iidi ko trigar karne ke liye istemaal hone vaale remote control ke siganlon ko bekaar kiya ja sake
 
 
 In other areas, jammers are deployed at pre-determined locations
 
 
 vaise, jamaron ko faujee gadiyon main bhi lagaakar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Although the army appeared reluctant to talk about some of the jammer's special capabilities, NDTV found that most jammers could operate in a variety of different modes, including 'pre-initiation mode', Under which the army can blow up itself before the remote controlled IED gets a signal from the terrorists
 
 
 sena ke liye aatankwaadiyon se ek kadam aage rahane kaa ek hi sunishchit tarika he - yah pakkaa kar liya jaae ki ilaake kii har radio frequency ko har vakt jamaron se cover karke rakhaa jaae
 
 
 Our training during training is completely changed when an IED is found, and has to be destroyed or destroyed
 
 
 puraane vakt main bam-nirodhak daste khud bam ke paas jaakar use naakaam kiya karte the, lekin ab hamaari sena remoteli oparated whical (arovi - Remotely Operated Vehicles - ROV) istemaal karne ko tarjeeh detii he

 Later, while removing the corpses, the hand grenade explodes as soon as the security forces move the corpse of the terrorist
 
 
 lekin ab aisa nahin hota
 
 
 Now even if there is an explosion, its impact is not our military, the wheelbarrow-like ROV suffers

 But despite all this, there are occasions where bomb disposal squad technicians, officers and soldiers have to go to the bomb themselves and try to thwart it by hand

 Wearing heavy protective bomb-resistant suits weighing up to 40 kilograms, these army technicians take special care of their chest, neck and head while they are lying on the ground next to the IED and looking at it
 
 
 inke paas kaam karne ke liye telescopy manipulator (telescopic manipulator) bhi hota he, jo vyakti tathaa iidi ke bich duuri banaae rakhata he, jab iidi ko chhipaai gai jagah se nikaala ja rahaa ho, lekin aakhirkaar bam ko naakaam karne ke liye maanviya anguliyaan hi zaruri hai, jo kisi aise shaks kii hon, jiskaa dimag bahut tezi se kaam karata ho

 These bomb technicians cannot work without weariness, because even though there is a system to keep them cool within their heavy suits, working continuously for more than half an hour at a time, especially in summer, would have been impossible

 These technicians of the anti-bomb squads know that if they want to keep themselves alive, they will have to succeed every time, otherwise only one success of terrorists can make them sleep forever
 
 
 training range main meri mulaakaat paanch-varsh ke dante (dante) naamak labrador ritreaver se karwaai gai
 
 
 Dante is considered one of the finest dogs in the Northern Command to find an IED, and its nose is said to have saved many lives
 
 
 main dante or uske prashikshak ke saath ek farji bas stop tak gaya, jahaan achaanak dante thithak gaya, or chupchaap baith gaya
 
 
 He had found something
 
 
 uske prashikshak ne paas main hi rakhe ek bistar ko uthaakar dekha, or hamen katai hairaani nahin hui, jab vahaan ek visphotak mila
 
 
 The military team that accompanies these dogs, which investigates the streets, carries a jammer in a backpack loaded on their back, allowing the remote control signals used to trigger an IED
 Can be made useless
 
 
 anya ilaakon main jamaron ko pehle se tay jagahon par tainaat kar diya jaataa he
 
 
 By the way, jammers are also used in military vehicles
 
 
 haalanki sena jamaron kii kuch khaas kshamtaaon ke bare main baat karne ke liye anicchhuk dikhi, lekin NDTV ko pataa chalaa he ki adhiktar jaimar alag-alag tarah ke kai mod main kaam kar sakate hai, jinamein 'pre-inishiation mod' bhi shaamil he, jiske tahat remote control se chalane vaali iidi ko aatankwaadiyon kii ore se signal milane se pehle sena khud hi uda sakati he
 
 
 There is only one sure way for the army to stay one step ahead of the terrorists - ensure that every radio frequency in the area is covered by jammers at all times
 
 
 prashikshan ke dauraan hamaara dekha-bhaalaa yah khel us samay puri tarah badal jaataa he, jab koi iidi mil jaataa he, or use naakaam yaa nasht kiya janaa hota he
 
 
 In the past, the bomb disposal squad used to go near the bomb and thwart it, but now our army prefers to use the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
 
 
 british wheelbaro arovi (british Wheelbarrow ROV) bydaree se chalati he, or is par lage camaron kii madad se iskaa sanchaalak iidi ko surakshit duuri par rahakar dekh paata he
 
 
 Wheelbarrows capable of weighing up to 75 kilograms are commonly used to overturn the corpses of terrorists, who often carry live hand grenades under their bodies immediately before dying in an encounter
 
 
 baad main laashon ko hataate vakt jaise hi suraksha bal aatankwaadi kii laash ko hilaate, hand grenade fat jaataa
 
 
 But now this does not happen
 
 
 ab agar visphot hota bhi he, to uskaa sara prabhaav hamaare faujee nahin, wheelbaro jaisi arovi jhelti hai
 
 
 In addition, the ROV also pulls out the hidden ieds from its mechanical claws, and also has a disrupter mechanism, which is actually a gun-like thing, which could not fail before the IED was damaged
 Throws at a distance

 in kutton ke saath chalane vaali faujee team, jo sadakon kii padtaal karti he, apni peeth par laden backpac (backpack - baste) main jaimar (jammer) lekar chalati he, jisase kisi iidi ko trigar karne ke liye istemaal hone vaale remote control ke siganlon ko bekaar kiya ja sake
 
 
 In other areas, jammers are deployed at pre-determined locations
 
 
 vaise, jamaron ko faujee gadiyon main bhi lagaakar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Although the army appeared reluctant to talk about some of the jammer's special capabilities, NDTV found that most jammers could operate in a variety of different modes, including 'pre-initiation mode', Under which the army can blow up itself before the remote controlled IED gets a signal from the terrorists
 
 
 sena ke liye aatankwaadiyon se ek kadam aage rahane kaa ek hi sunishchit tarika he - yah pakkaa kar liya jaae ki ilaake kii har radio frequency ko har vakt jamaron se cover karke rakhaa jaae
 
 
 Our training during training is completely changed when an IED is found, and has to be destroyed or destroyed
 
 
 puraane vakt main bam-nirodhak daste khud bam ke paas jaakar use naakaam kiya karte the, lekin ab hamaari sena remoteli oparated whical (arovi - Remotely Operated Vehicles - ROV) istemaal karne ko tarjeeh detii he

 Later, while removing the corpses, the hand grenade explodes as soon as the security forces move the corpse of the terrorist
 
 
 lekin ab aisa nahin hota
 
 
 Now even if there is an explosion, its impact is not our military, the wheelbarrow-like ROV suffers
 
 
 iske alaava arovi chhipi hui iidi ko bhi apane maikenical panjon se khinchati hai, or inamen diserptor maikenism (disrupter mechanism) bhi laga hota he, jo darasal ek bandook jaisi chiz hoti he, jo naakaam nahin ho pai iidi ko nuksaan pahunchaa paane se pehle surakshit duuri par phenk detii he
 
 
 But despite all this, there are occasions where bomb disposal squad technicians, officers and soldiers have to go to the bomb themselves and try to thwart it by hand
 
 
 yah ek aisa behad khatarnaak kaam he, jisamen focus, kushalta or takat kii madad se hi zindagi ke saath rahakar maut ko maat di ja sakati he

 On the night of 20 January, when you were having dinner while watching your favorite program on TV, at the same time, a huge fire broke out in three factories in Bawana Industrial area of delhi

 But there is a picture of this incident which will sink into the desert of your mind

 But both are badly burned, scorched

 Many kinds of thoughts came to mind, in mind
 pehle to kaafii der tak inkaa naam kya hoga? kahaan kii hongi ye donon? kab dilli aae honge? koi rishta hoga inkaa yaa dar kii vajah se donon ne ek duusare ko kasake pakad liya hoga

 Probably hoped that the answers to my questions would be found from this picture itself, but where was this to happen

 The victim has alleged that a woman abused him on the first call

 Even after giving information of this matter to the police, we are seeing laxity in the case

 After all, while investigating who were the guards who attacked them, the Delhi Aaj Tak reporters reached the house of a senior SP leader and fell victim to misconduct there
 darasal jis number par chemist ko phone kar dhamkaaya gaya, phir guard bhej kar pitwaya gaya, usee number kii jab padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki use samaajawaadee party ke ek varisht netaa kii bahu yuj kar rahi hai
 So did the SP leader's daughter-in-law send the guards and beat the chemist

32 am, a man in a safari suit enters the shop
 wo counter par maujuud chemist se kisi khaas daawa kii maang karata he jiske baad chemist use bataata he ki dawa nahin he
 But he gives another option
 
 After this, the person buying the medicine calls someone, explains the whole thing
 iske baad wo phone chemist ko detaa he
 a woman's voice comes from the other side on the phone and she talks abusively to the chemist, abuses
 jiske baad chemist number note kar phone waapas kar detaa he
 After that person leaves, the chemist calls the woman again from her landline, but again the same action happens on behalf of the woman
 ye sabakuch ho jane ke baad dawa kii dukaan par sab saamaanya ho jaataa he
 But 10 at night
 57 par kuch log dhadadhad dukaan main ghuste hai

 The subsequent pictures are not on CCTV but the victim chemist said that while taking them out, they beat him fiercely and later left in the car
 waapas aane ke baad chemist ne police ko soochna di
 These pictures of Yusuf Sarai of Delhi raise a big question

 lekin PMO kii ore se unhen ye kabhi nahin kaha gaya ki paise online mod se bhejo
 Actually, the money order sent by the PMO to Sathe was sent back to him
 saathe ne india today ko bataaya, “maine PMO ko 29 november ko maniorder bheja tha
 On December 10, i got a call from the post office and i was told that my money order has been canceled and that i should come to the post office and get my money

 So, in the fact check, the claim was found wrong that the PMO was asked to send money online instead of helping the distressed farmer

 In such a situation, the contest between the two members of the Makdai royal family, which belongs to the Gond caste, will be very interesting

 The Jantar Mantar ex-servicemen movement will take place on Sunday on the issue of One Rank One Pension
 ravivaar se subah saadhe das se purv sainik dharna or pradarshan kii shuruyaat karenge
 There is also a possibility that the soldiers will meet the President on Sunday and return them their medals
 iske baad somvaar se ye bhukh hadtaal par baithenge
 Earlier, within 10 days, Army Chief General Dalbir Singh, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have met ex-servicemen on the same issue, but nothing happened
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kah chuke hai ki ye ek jatil mudda he or sabase baat karke sarkaar ise lagu karegi
 There are about 2
5 million ex-servicemen across the country
 ek khule patr main purv sainikon ne maang kii ki yojana ke karyanvayan ke liye ek nishchit taarikh ghoshit kii jaani chahie
 The letter comes ahead of a Sunday rally by another group of former army personnel on the issue
 akhil bhartiya purv sainik seva parishad ne kaha ki van rank, van pension ek jwalanth or bhaavnaatmak mudda he
 It is worth noting that Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and Army Chief Dalbir Singh Suhag and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had themselves agreed on One Rank nor Pension in the Mann Ki Baat program
 lekin, piem ne is mudde kii jatilta ko samaapt karne ke liye kuch vakt maanga tha
 The comments ullekhneey he ki yah mudda bijepi kaa chunavi ghoshnaptr kaa hissaa bhi rahaa or ab sarkaar ko bane ek saal se bhi zyada samay biit chukaa he or kuch nahin hone par purv sainik baichaiyn hote ja rahe hai
 Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has also supported this demand of ex-servicemen and he has also met these soldiers
 kareeb 33 saalon se purv sainikon kii yah maang or iske samarthan main andolan jari he
 Explain that in the second term, the UPA government had accepted this demand in the last days and had approved 500 crore rupees for it
 vahiin nai sarkaar ne jab is aa rahe kharch kaa byora nikaala to yah aankada kareeb 8300 karod rupee par chalaa gaya
 The biggest difficulty of the government is that if this demand of the former army is accepted, then similar demand of paramilitary forces will also have to be fulfilled
 iske baad somvaar se ye bhukh hadtaal par baithenge

 Explain bataa den ki duusare kaarykaal main upie sarkaar ne antim dinon main is maang ko maan liya tha or 500 karod rupee iske liye sweekrut kiye the
 At the same time, when the new government took out the details of this upcoming expenditure, this figure went to about 8300 crores
 sarkaar kii sabase badi mushkil yah he ki yadi purv sena kii yah maang maan lee gai to ardhsainik balon kii aisi hi maang bhi puri kerani hogi
 In an open letter, ex-servicemen demanded that a fixed date should be announced for the implementation of the plan
 yah patr purv senakarmiyon ke ek anya samooh dwaara mudde par ravivaar ko kii jane vaali raily se pehle aayaa he
 The All India ex-servicemen Service Council said that One Rank, One Pension is a burning and emotional issue
 gaur karne kii baat yah he ki rakshaamantri manohar parrikar or sena pramukh dalbir singh suhaag or yahaan tak kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khud man kii baat kaarykram main van rank na pension par apni sahmati jataai thi
 However, the PM sought some time to end the complexity of the issue
 tippaniyan It is worth mentioning that this issue was also a part of bjp's election manifesto and now more than a year has passed to the government and ex-servicemen are becoming restless if nothing happens
 purv sainikon kii is maang kaa samarthan congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi kar chuke hai or vah in sainikon se mil bhi chuke hai
 This demand of ex-servicemen and movement in support of it has been going on for almost 33 years

 pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar jab baatcheet ke liye bharat aaenge to hurriyat netaaon se bhi milenge
 Mirwaiz Umar Farooq made this claim after meeting Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit on the occasion of Eid Milan organized at the Pakistan High Commission
 hurriyat netaa mirwiz umr faruk ne kaha he ki use pakistan ke ucchayukta abdul basit ne bharosa diya he ki bharat se koi bhi baatcheet kashmir ke bina nahin ho sakati
 Mirwaiz, who came to attend the Eid Milan ceremony held at the Pakistan High Commission, said this after a closed-door meeting with Abdul Basit
 gyaat ho ki hurriyat netaaon se paak ucchayukta kii mulaaqaat ke baad hi modi sarkaar ne pichley saal agast main padosi mulk ke saath hone vaali videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet ko radd kar diya tha
 According to the consensus reached in Ufa, the meeting of the National Security Advisers of India and Pakistan is to be held in Delhi
 mirwiz ko isse koi etraz nahin ki pakistan ke enese sartaaj ajeez bhartiya enese ajit dobhaal se mulaaqaat se pehle hurriyat leaders se milte hai yaa baad main
 They believe that the Kashmir problem can be solved only after better relations between India and Pakistan
 tippaniyan An invitation was also sent to Syed Ali Shah Geelani for this ceremony of Eid Milan, but he did not attend
 mirwiz ne iske peeche vajah bataate hue kaha ki ufaa main bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantriyon kii mulaaqaat ke baad jari saajha bayaan main kashmir samasya kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya, jisase hurriyat ke kai netaa naaraaz hai, isliye ve isamen shaamil nahin hue
 In a closed-door conversation, Mirwaiz raised the issue with Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit and only after that was the trust given by the High Commissioner
 mirwiz ke mutabiq basit ne unhen ye bhi saaf kiya ki saajha bayaan pradhanmantriyon kii meeting main uthe muddon par aadhaarit tha na ki bharat or pakistan ke bich ke tamaam muddon ko samete
 Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has said that he has been assured by Pakistan's High Commissioner Abdul Basit that no dialogue with India can take place without Kashmir
 pakistan ucchayog main yojit id milan samaaroh main shaamil hone aae mirwiz ne abdul basit se band kamare main mulaaqaat ke baad ye baat kahi
 It is to be known that only after the meeting of the Hurriyat leaders with the Pakistan High Commissioner, the Modi government canceled the Foreign Secretary level talks with the neighboring country in August last year
 ufaa main bani sahmati ke mutabik, bharat or pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron kii baithak dilli main honi he
 Mirwaiz had no idea whether Pakistan's NSA Sartaj Aziz would meet Hurriyat leaders before or after the Indian NSA, Ajit Doval
 ve maanate hai ki bharat or pakistan ke bich behatar sambandh hone ke baad hi kashmir samasya kaa samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 The comments id milan ke is samaaroh main syed ali shah gilaani ko bhi nimantran bheja gaya tha, lekin ve isamen shaamil nahin hue
 Mirwaiz, stating the reason behind this, said that the joint statement issued after the meeting of the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in Ufa did not mention the Kashmir problem, due to which many Hurriyat leaders are angry, so they did not join it
 band kamare main hui baatcheet main mirwiz ne pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit ke saamne ye mudda uthaaya or uske baad hi ucchayukta kii taraf se ye bharosa diya gaya
 According to Mirwaiz, Basit also made it clear to him that the shared statement was based on the issues raised in the Prime Ministers' meeting and not on all issues between India and Pakistan
 gyaat ho ki hurriyat netaaon se paak ucchayukta kii mulaaqaat ke baad hi modi sarkaar ne pichley saal agast main padosi mulk ke saath hone vaali videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet ko radd kar diya tha

 Nitish said that the Congress was not going to get more than 15 seats but we contested 40 seats in the grand alliance

 Former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav said that i stand in opposition to this proposal
 hamen bijepi ke khilaaf vot mila tha, ye sab priplan tha
 This is a kind of murder of democracy
 bijepi ke bhi kai mantri hai jinpar aarope hai, nitish kumaar or susheel modi par bhi aarope hai
 Tejashwi said that Congress and RJD together saved Nitish Kumar's existence, Nitish betrayed the people of Bihar

 nitish ke paas 71, bijepi or sahyogiyon ke paas 58 siten hai
 There were 129 in total
 4 nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 The NDA claims to have 132 members in their favor
 vahiin sabase bade dal argedy ke khate main 80, congress ke paas 27 or sipiem ke paas 3 vidhayak hai
 Jaitley, who managed to convince Sharad Yadav? His party JDU had rebel against Nitish's decision to go with the NDA
 guuruuvaar ko party ke rajyasabha saansad ali anwar ne kaha ki bijepi ke saath jane kii unki antaratma gavaahi nahin de rahi
 There were also reports of displeasure of senior party leader Sharad Yadav
 guuruuvaar ko sharad yadav congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi sa bhi mili or shaam main jediu ke naaraaz netaa dilli main sharad yadav ke ghar aakar mili
 Later Ali Anwar said that there is no such thing as rebellion in the party right now

 The revolt in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has also started rising after the Mahagathbandhan broke down in Lalu's party in protest
 rajd ke gaighat ke vidhayak maheshwar yadav ne gathbandhan tuutane ke liye party ke adhyaksh lalu prasad or unke putr purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi prasad yadav ko jimmedaar bataaya he

 kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) dwaara tejasvi yadav par praathmiki darj hone ke baad agar istipha de diya jaataa to gathbandhan nahin tuutata
 The big blow to the dream of the National Grand Alliance will be seen in the politics of this big change in the politics of the Center
