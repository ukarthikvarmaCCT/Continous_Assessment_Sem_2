 ' desh main 10 saal or dilli main 15 saal sarkaar chalaane ke baad congress ab virodh kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 It is not even a month since the new government came that the party has come down to all kinds of rhetoric, from protests to protests
 inamen zyaadaatar ve netaa hai jo chunaav jeet nahin paae
 In Delhi, these leaders have taken to the streets to alleviate the suffering of people suffering from power shortage
 dharna-pradarshan vagairah dhadlle se ho rahaa he
 These leaders are mistaking each other by forgetting their mutual grievances
 pani-bijli kii kami ko ve is shiddat se uthaa rahe hai jaise ki vah bijepi kii nai sarkaar kii dein ho
 They are pretending to forget that they have run the government of Delhi and the Center for so many years, and if something is going wrong then it is their responsibility
 dilli main bijli kaa nijeekaran congress kii hi to dein he jiske bare main itani awaajen uthaai ja rahi hai
 If there is any deficiency in this system, then they are directly responsible for it
 lekin raajnneeti ke khel niraale hai
 Here the truth becomes false and the right is falsified
 congress bhi aisa kar rahi he, uske netaa ek tarah se apni tamaam gadabadiyon ko nai sarkaar par thopane kii taiyaari main lage hue hai
 Till yesterday, these issues did not matter to them and today they have become big
 congress ke is achaanak se badale rukh se bijepi utani pareshaan nahin he jitani aam aadmi party
 This party, which has raised the voice of protest in the state and the country, has come to the fore
 use yakeen nahin tha ki congress itani jaldi unase yah shrey chin legi or virodh kaa pratik ban jaaegi
 But the party is unable to understand why this happened
 darasal abhi tak vah ateet se nikal nahin nikal pai he
 He feels that his place is safe and he only has the privilege to express his voice of protest
 lekin kejariwal ko yah abhas nahin ho paa rahaa he ki vakt kaaphi badal chukaa he or log bhi
 Here now is the fight for survival, they will have to prove themselves again
 
 However, now we have to see how the party deals with this new challenge
 congress dedh sau saal puraani party he or satta main rahane ke gur jaanati he
 It is also organized and has abundant resources
 parajeet or parrast aam aadmi party kaa sidhaa muqabla usase hi he
 The truth is that Congress leaders are now trying to come to the fray again and are trying to play the role of the opposition, but it is also true that with some demonstration, they will not be able to do anything special, just their Will be able to keep 'alive' in politics because he had laid the foundation of what is going wrong today
 hindu dharamshastron main shivaratri ko sabase uttam vrath kaha he
 It has also been called Vratraj in many accounts and it has been written about its importance that it is a Mahavrata to give all four Purusharthas i
e
 religion, meaning, work and salvation
 shastron main yah bhi likhit he ki shivaratri har maheene main krishna paksh kii chaturdashi tithi ko hoti hai, lekin phalgun maah kii shivaratri hi mahashivaratri he, jab shiv kaa shakti se milan hua tha or brahamand kii utpaadati kaa shriganesh hua tha
 According to the scriptures, Lord Shiva is pleased by saying, listening and reading the story of this fast
 yahaan prastut he, mahashivaratri kii sabase vishwasaneey or pramanik katha
 
 
 Once Goddess Parvati asked Lord Shiva, 'which is the best and simple fast-worship, from which the beings of the dead land get your grace easily?' In reply, Shivji told this story by telling Parvati the law of 'shivaratri' fast: “ek baar chitrabhanu naamak ek shikari tha
 He used to raise his family by killing animals
 vah ek sahuukaar kaa rini tha, lekin uskaa rin samay par na chukaa sakaa
 The angry moneylender captives the hunter at Shivamath
 sanyog se us din shivaratri thi
 The hunter meditated and kept listening to religious things related to Shiva
 chaturdashi ko usne shivaratri vrath kii katha bhi suni
 Just before dusk, the moneylender called him to him and talked about repaying the loan
 shikari agle din sara rin lautaa dene kaa vachan dekar bandhan se chhot gaya
 Like his daily routine he went out hunting in the forest
 lekin dinabhar bandi grih main rahane ke kaaran bhukh-pyaas se vyakul tha
 To hunt, he started making a halt on the vine tree at the edge of a pond
 bel vriksh ke neeche shivlinga tha jo vilvapatron se dhakaa hua tha
 Hunter could not find the person
 padaav banaate samay usne jo tahaniyaan todin, ve sanyog se shivlinga par giriin
 In this way, fasting and thirsty hunters were also fasted throughout the day and bell-sheets were also climbed on Shivling
 ek pahar raatri biit jane par ek garbhini mrigi talab par pani pine pahunchi
 As soon as the hunter drew an arrow on the bow, the deer said, 'I am pregnant
 sheeghra hi prasav karuungi
 You will kill two creatures together, which is not right
 main bachche ko janm dekar sheeghra hi tumhaare samaksh prastut ho jaaoongi, tab maar lenaa
 The hunter loosened the cross and the deer disappeared into the wild bushes
 kuch hi der baad ek or mrigi udhar se nikali
 The hunter was over the moon
 sameep aane par usne dhanush par baan chadhaaya
 Seeing her, the deer politely pleaded, 'O Pardhi! i retired from the season a while ago
 kamaatur virahinee hum
 i am wandering in search of my beloved main apane pati se milakar sheeghra hi tumhaare paas aa jaaoongi
 ' The hunter let him go as well
 do baar shikaar ko khokar uskaa maathaa thanka
 He was in all sort of thoughts
 raatri kaa aakhri pahar biit rahaa tha
 Then another antelope escaped with her children
 shikari ke liye yah svarnim avasar tha
 He did not take long to shoot arrows at the bow
 vah tir chhodane hi vaala tha ki mrigi boli, 'he pardhi! main in bacchon ko inke pita ke hawaale karke laut aauungi
 Do not kill me this time
 ’ The hunter laughed and said, 'leave the victim in front, i am not such a fool
 isse pehle main do baar apana shikaar kho chukaa hum
 My children must be suffering from hunger and thirst
 ’ uttar main mrigi ne phir kaha, ‘jaise tumhen apane bacchon kii mamata sata rahi he, thik vaise hi mujhe bhi
 Therefore, in the name of children, i am seeking life for a while
 he pardhi! meraa vishwaas kar, main inhen inke pita ke paas chhodkar turant lautne kii pratigya karti hum
 ' mrigi kaa deen swar sunakar shikari ko us par dayaa aa gai
 He let that chicken escape too
 shikaar ke abhaav main bel-vriksh par baitha shikari belptr tod-todakar neeche phenkata ja rahaa tha
 When the dawn broke, a strong deer came on the same path
 shikari ne soch liya ki iskaa shikaar vah avashya karegaa
 Seeing the trunk of the hunter, the deer said in a polite voice, 'O Pardhi brother! If you have killed three antelopes and small children coming before me, do not delay in killing me too, so that i do not have to suffer a single moment in their disconnection
 main un mrigiyon kaa pati hum
 If you have given them life, please give me some life too
 main unase milakar tumhaare samaksh upasthit ho jaaoongaa
 ' mrug kii baat sunate hi shikari ke saamne puri raat kaa ghatnachakra gum gaya, usne sari katha mrug ko suna di
 Then the deer said, 'the way my three wives have gone as promised, i will not be able to follow my religion with my death
 atah jaise tumne unhen vishwaasapaatr maanakar choda he, vaise hi mujhe bhi jane do
 i will appear before you soon with all of them
 ’ The violent heart of the hunter was purged by fasting, night-awakening and climbing the bell-sheet on Shivling
 usamen bhagavad shakti kaa vaas ho gaya tha
 The bow and arrow were easily left from his hand
 bhagwaan shiv kii anukanpa se uskaa hinsak hriday kaarunik bhaavon se bhar gaya
 He started burning in the flame of repentance remembering his past deeds
 thodi hi der baad vah mrug sapariwaar shikari ke samaksh upasthit ho gaya, taaki vah unka shikaar kar sake, kintu junglee pashuon kii aisi satyata, satviktaa evam samuhik prembhaavana dekhakar shikari ko badi glani hui
 There was a burst of tears from his eyes
 us mrug parivaar ko na markar shikari ne apane kathor hriday ko jeev hinsa se hataa sadaa ke liye komal evam dayaalu bana liya
 All the Dev Samaj from Devalok were also watching this event
 ghatana kii parinti hote hi devi-devataaon ne pushp-varsha kii
 Then the hunter and antelope family attained salvation
 ” Religion penetrating and knowledgeable states that according to the story of the hunter associated with Mahashivaratri, Mahadev Shiva, the deity of the gods, also gives the fruits of unintentional resolve, virtuous work and fast
 ve thode prayaas or nishtha se bhi prasann ho jate hai, isliye ve ashutosh kehalaate hai

 Yes, Radhe can escape from mother country

 The family of the girl who filed a case against him in Mumbai has also expressed apprehension
 peedit ke bhai kaa daawaahe ki mumbai police radhe maa ke khilaaf luk out notice jari kar chuki he

 Some devotees start pressing Radhe Ma's feet, then the devotees on whom Radhe Maa is more kind, they lift up the Radhe Ma in the lap and start swinging

 Dhankubers are always in front of Radhe Ma, who lives in a luxurious ashram in Tantamumbai, from Bollywood stars to society's Dhankubers

 suniye: raja natvarlaal kaa gaanaa 'flip yor collar back' The decision of demonetisation led to chaos in the country
 After demonetisation, the impact of demonetisation on the business of organized and unorganized sectors was around 99
 30 fisadi puraane note bank main hue jam xxrep 4 a j 8 november he, or notebandi kii yaaden ek baar phir taaja ho gayi
 On 8 November 2016, at 8 pm, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the sudden withdrawal of 500 and 1000 notes
 darasal, notembdi kii charchaa aaj bhi hoti he, kyonki isse har ek bhartiya kaa saamana hua tha
 But the central government gradually opted out of demonetisation
 aakhir kyon sarkaar ab notebandi kaa zikr nahin karnaa chaahati he?is masale par india today hindi ke editor anshuman tiwari kaa kahana he ki notembdi ko lekar teen saal ke baad bhi sarkaar ke paas kehane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 The government may claim that the demonetisation move was right, but the government has failed to present any concrete data regarding its success
 notebandi kii kadavi yadenunhone kaha ki notebandi ke nakaaratmak pahaluon ke saamne aane ke baad pradhanmantri samet satta dal ke bade netaa is babat baat karne se bachate rahe hai
 Because the decision of demonetisation created an atmosphere of chaos in the entire country, most of the demonetisation impacted the business of organized and unorganized sectors
 kyonki notebandi ko lekar sarkaar kii koi taiyaari nahin thi
 Rules were being changed everyday after demonetisation
 chote udyogon ko uthaanaa padaa nuksaandrasal desh main log notebandi se hui pareshaani ko ab tak bhuule nahin hai
 The biggest impact of demonetisation was on the industries that mostly deal in cash
 isamen adhiktar chote udyog shaamil hote hai
 During demonetisation, there was a shortage of cash for these industries
 isaki vajah se unka kaarobaar thap pad gaya
 People went to jobs
 isliye laai gai notebandinotbandi laane kii modi sarkaar ne kai vajahen bataayin
 There were several reasons for eliminating black money, eliminating fake currency in circulation, terrorism and promoting cashless economy including curbing Naxal activities
 sarkaar kaa tark he ki notebandi ke baad tex collection badha or kaledhan main istemaal hone vaala paisa system main aa chukaa he
 But no data related to this has been revealed even after three years
 kareeb 99
 RBI data on 30 old bank notes said that 99 closed during demonetisation
 30 fisadi 500 or 1000 ke puraane note bank main waapas aa gaye
 When all the money is returned to the banks, the question arises as to how the government was successful in capturing black money? Impact on the growth rate After the ban, GDP got a setback, which the country has not yet recovered
 notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke baad kii pehali timahi main jidipi vruddhi dar ghatakar 6
 It had come down to 1 percent
 jabaki isi dauraan saal 2015 main yah 7
 Was at 9 percent
 maujuuda samay main jidipi vikaas dar girakar 5 fisadi par aa gai, jo pichley chah saal main sabase nichalaa timahi aankada he
 In such a situation, it is not easy for the Modi government to get rid of the failures of demonetisation

 To the question of being immersed in alcohol, he gave a big philosophical answer, "there are two contracts in the village

 Taking the compensation of the land, everyone is drinking alcohol

" unki jindagi kii hakeekat yah he ki badalpur se lakhanu kaaphi dur he
 And Rajpal is so lagged behind in the race of life that even heliped at the distance of few steps from his house cannot help him in deciding this distance

 In such a situation, a tweet by Tripura Governor Tathagata Roy has come under controversy

 'kabhi Dahi Handi, today a cracker, may tomorrow be a candle and award citing pollution, Gangs may also petition to burn the funeral pyre of Hindus! - Tathagata Roy (@ tathagata2) October 10, 2017 Governor in a phone conversation with India Today Made it clear that he was unhappy with the Supreme Court order for being a Hindu, as it deprived the community of an important aspect associated with its celebration

 Recently he made a controversial statement for the Rohingya calling it 'garbage'

 Proves I'm on right track— Tathagata Roy (@ tathagata2) September 10, 2017 Earlier, writer Chetan Bhagat also gave his response to the Supreme Court verdict
 unhone bhi supreme court ke faisle par nakhushi jaahir karte hue pataakhon kii bikri par bain lagane ko gaiyr-jaruri bataaya tha
 He questioned that on what basis are the traditions of someone being banned? SC bans fireworks on Diwali? a full ban? What's Diwali for children without crackers? - Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) October 9, 2017 Chetan Bhagat wrote in a tweet, 'what does Diwali mean for children without firecrackers?' The author said that the Supreme Court ban is an injury to traditions
 unhone kaha ki bain kii jagah regulation behatar vikalp ho saktaa tha
 Chetan Bhagat, after expressing his displeasure in the case, had also made several suggestions to control pollution
 unhone kaha ki public transport kii haalat sudhaarna bhi pradooshan par lagaam lagane kaa ek badhiya vikalp ho saktaa he
 He wrote, 'come with new ideas, not with Bain
 ' dilli-ensiaar kii kharaab aabo-hawa sudhaarney ke liye chetan ne ek hafte ke liye bijli or kaaron kaa istemaal nahin karne kaa bhi suzav diya
 Banning crackers on Diwali is like banning Christmas trees on Christmas and goats on bakr-eid
 Regulate
 Don ' t ban
 Respect traditions
 - Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) October 9, 2017 Bhagat also said why only Hindus show courage to ban the festival? Will the sacrifice of goats and the bloodshed of Muharram soon stop? For those who want to improve the festivals like Diwali, i also want to see the same strong blood-filled festivals to improve them

 In the Serious World Cup, the team India was not looking at the number-4, looking for a face to bat at number-4
 yah khoj semifinal tak pahunchane ke baad bhi khatm nahin hui, iskaa khamiyaja team india ko haar ke rup main bhugatna padaa
 The selectors chose Vijay Shankar, Dinesh Karthik, Lokesh Rahul and Kedar Jadhav
 lekin ye sabhi naam is world cap main number-4 par naakaam rahe
 Although Rahul had scored a century in number four in the practice match against Bangladesh, he was given the responsibility of opening the innings with Rohit Sharma due to Shikhar Dhawan's injury

 In this World Cup, Karthik scored just 14 runs in two innings of 3 matches
 team management unka bhi role samajhane se bachataa rahaa
 Did not pay attention to managing batting order In the last round of this World Cup, Team India did not look confident with their playing-11

 in se saabhaar) With the arrival of 'hudhud', there is curiosity about the naming of cyclones
 kya aaf jaanate hai ki in tufaanon ke naam koun rakhata he?isaki shuruyaat atlantic kshetra main 1953 main ek sandhi ke madhyam se hui thi or hind mahaasaagar kshetra ke aath deshon ne bharat kii pahal par 2004 se chakravaateey tufaan kaa naam dene ke intjaam shuru kiye
 Under this, these names are selected from the names already suggested by the member countries
 katrina, lisa, laire, hikaaka, bulbul, faleen, hudahud, jaise chakravaat kii bhayavahata ke bich inke anokhe naam hameshaa se hi logon ke bich utsukata kaa vishay rahe hai
 The tradition of naming continues since 1953 Ajit Tyagi, former Director General of the Indian Meteorological Department, said that the tradition of naming hurricanes and cyclones in the Atlantic region has been continuing since 1953, which started at the initiative of the National Hurricane Center in Miami
 isaki dekharekh geneva sthit vishwa mausam sanghathan karata he
 He said that this system in the Indian Ocean region started in the year 2004 when on the initiative of India, eight coastal countries entered into an agreement in this regard
 in deshon main bharat, bangladesh, pakistan, myamar, maldive, srilanka, oman or thailand shaamil hai
 Tyagi elaborated in this regard and said, 'these eight countries have suggested names to suit their choice
 angreji varnmaala ke mutabik, sadsy deshon ke naam ke pehle akshar ke anusaar unka kram tay kiya gaya he or usee kram main inaki ore se sujhaaye gaye naamon ke anusaar chakravaaton ke naam rakhe jate hai
 'oman suggested' hudhud'tyagi cites that for example, the region was preceded by the last cyclone Nanuk which was named after Myanmar
 krmanusaar pichhali baar myamar kii baari thi jabaki is baar oman kii baari thi or ‘hudahud’ naam oman kii ore se sujhaaye gaye naamon kii suchi main se aayaa he
 Earlier, the name of 'pillin' cyclone was suggested by Thailand
 unhone kaha ki isi tarah se agle chakravaat kaa naam pakistan kii ore se sujhaaye gaye naamon main se rakhaa jayega
 Tyagi said names suggested by India include 'cloud, air, sea, fire' etc
 saal 2004 se pehle hind mahasagar kshetra main chakravaat kaa naam nahin rakhaa jaataa tha or taarikh ke anusaar inhen sambodhit kiya jaataa tha
 The former IMD Director General said that the eight member countries of the Indian Ocean have suggested names on their own and so far about 64 names of the cyclone have been listed
 unhone bataaya ki kuch samay pehle jab kram ke anusaar bharat kii baari thi tab aise hi ek chakravaat kaa naam bharat kii ore se sujhaaye gaye naamon main se ek ‘lahar’ rakhaa gaya tha

 chunki sarkaar yuvaaon ke bhavishya ke prati udasin he, virodh karne vaale chaatro ne virodh pradarshan ko desh ke sabhi shaharon tak le jane kaa faisla kiya or thaan liya he ki nyaay milane tak andolan ko jari rakhenge
 As such, every person wants to taste success in his life
 lekin safalataa lambey samay tak tiki rahe, iske liye vyakti ko jivan main kuch khaas baton kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 Now take PM Modi of the country
 desh ke piem modi behad saadhaaran parivaar se taalluk rakhte hai
 Despite this, he achieved everything in his life whose dreams are avoided even by ordinary people
 aaie aaj unke jivan se jude safalataa ke wo mantra jaanate hai jinhen apanaate hi aapako bhi vyakti kamyaabi ke sikhar par pahunch saktaa he
 There is no shortcut to success - often people start cursing fate for their failure, while the reality is that luck is subject to human karma
 safalataa kaa koi shortkat nahin hota hai
 In one of his interviews with Akshay Kumar, PM Modi said something similar
 unhone kaha, 'agar mujhe alladin kaa chiraag mil jaae to main use kahuunga kii ye jitne bhi samajashastri or shikshavid hai unke dimag main bhar do ki wo aane vaali pidiyon ko ye alladin ke chiraag vaali theory padhaani band kar den
 Teach them to work hard
 'apane lakshya ko paane ke liye kadi mehnat karen-safalataa kaa doosraa mantra yah he ki sadaiv apane lakshya ko paane ke liye jute rahe
 Modi ji said in his interview that he uses every moment of his life to achieve his set goal

 He told that he too has no skill other than this mantra to succeed
 soshal media bhi he jaruri-modi ne apane intervyuu main bollywood star akshay kumaar ko bataaya ki wo desh-duniya kii khabaron ke liye soshal media par apni najar jarur banaaen rakhte hai
 He said, i definitely watch social media, it keeps me informed about what is going on outside
 aap bhi jivan main achche avasar praapt karne ke liye soshal media kaa sahaara le sakate hai
 a healthy body is a sign of a healthy brain - You must have often heard people say that a healthy brain resides in a healthy body
 yadi vyakti kaa sharir swasth nahin hoga to mastishk bhi swasth nahin rah saktaa he
 PM Modi said in his interview that disease is the biggest issue in our country and there are only two ways to avoid it, cleanliness and fitness
 mehnat se nahin churaate dil-modi safal hone ke liye ek khaas tarah ke work culture ko apane aasapaas develop karne main vishwaas rakhte hai
 They believe that by lying to a person you cannot impress him for a long time
 unka maananaa he ki safal hone ke liye kaam ke samay kaam or apane jivan main anushaasan kaa hona behad jaruri he
 Bollywood star Akshay Kumar would like to remember this moment of life

 David Cameron praised Modi and Manmohan strongly - Had Manmohan's time attacked Pakistan, had there been a second terrorist attack like Mumbai, India's army would have attacked Pakistan
 yah kahana he britain ke purv pradhanmantri david camran kaa
 Cameron recalled the period between 2010 and 2016 during the release of his book 'for the Record' on Thursday
 is dauraan camran ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath mere achche rishte rahe
 He is a saintly man, but he was also tough on India's threats
 unhone mujhase bharat daure ke dauraan kaha tha ki mumbai main 2008 ke aatankwaadi hamale kii tarah koi doosraa aatankwaadi hamalaa hota he to bharat ko pakistan ke khilaaf sainya karrwai kerani hogi
 In his book Cameron covers 52 years of his life in personal and business developments
 is kitaab main 2010 se 2016 ke bich ke samay kaa khaas taur par ullekh kiya gaya he
 This was also the time when Cameron was the Prime Minister of Britain
 camran ne kaha, 'bharat ke sandarbh main maine kaha tha ki hamen aadhunik sahabhaagita kii jarurat he na ki aupniveshik aparaadh kii bhaavana kii
 This partnership should be with the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy
 britain ke kai safal vyavsaayee or saanskrithik hastiyaan bhartiya mul ke rahe hai or is prayaas main ve kaaphi sahaayak sabit ho sakate hai
 Cameron strongly praised Modi, besides former PM Manmohan Singh, he also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone november main wemble stadium main sambodhan ke dauraan stage par piem modi se gale milane kii ghatana ko yaad kiya
 He said, 'there have been many moments, including the gathering of the largest crowd of people of Indian origin at Wembley Stadium
 'camran ne kaha, 'modi ke sambodhan se pehle maine 60 hajaar logon se kaha tha ki mujhe lagata he ki kisi din bhartiya mul kaa british vyakti 10 downing street main pradhanmantri ke taur par aayega
 The crowd of people nodded and approved it which was amazing
 or jaise hi stage par modi or maine ek-duusare ko gale lagaaya mujhe ummid jaagi ki yah britain dwaara duniya ko khule hriday se swaagat karne kaa sanket degaa
 Walking in Mumbai's slums: Remembering his visit to India, the former Prime Minister of Britain also mentioned walking in the slums of Mumbai
 apni kitaab main unhone amritsar ke aitihaasik swarna mandir ke daure kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 He was the first Prime Minister of Britain who expressed grief over the Jallianwala Bagh massacre
 camran ne likhaa he, 'kaaphi samay se british bhartiya samudaay ke mitra protsaahit kar rahe the ki main amritsar main swarna mandir jaaun
 In the colonial period, British soldiers opened fire on a peaceful meeting at the Sikh holy site in which hundreds of people were killed
 ' unhone kaha, 'koi bhi vartmaan pradhanmantri abhi tak amritsar nahin pahunchaa tha or jo hua us par dukh vyakt nahin kiya tha
 i wanted to change both things
 'unhone likhaa he, 'mere daure se pehle is baat ko lekar vivaad tha ki mujhe khed jataana chahie athwa nahin

 is tablet ko kuch hafte bhar yuj karne ke baad aisa lagata he ki company ise overol best tablet bana sakati thi, kyonki isamen kaaphi sambhaavnaaen hai
 In many respects, this tablet is excellent, but some of its things are also not right
 is rivyuu main ham aapako Galaxy Tab S6 kaa rivyuu denge jisase aapako yah tay karne main aasaani hogi ki aapako yah teb lenaa chahie yaa nahin
 Since there are only a few companies in India that launch good tabs
 smartphone centric market he, isliye kuch companiyaan yahaan apane tabs launch karne se bachati bhi hai
 Design and Build Quality The design and build quality of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 completely justifies its price
 yah teb kaaphi premium lagata he
 It is quite slim and its build quality is superb
 iskaa vajan 420 gram he or karvd aij kii vajah se ise hold karnaa kaaphi aasaan he
 In the front side of the tab you will notice at least bezels
 is tablet ke saath s Pen (stylus) diya gaya he
 There is a place for it on the back panel of the tablet where it fits
 iske liye magnetic panel kaa yuj kiya gaya he taaki ye apni jagah se na gire
 If you compare it to the ipad Pro, you will probably find the bezels given in it a bit thick
 keyboard alag se kharid sakate hai or ise atech karnaa kaaphi aasaan he
 This can also attach the mouse
 isamen chaar Dolby Atmos spikars die gaye hai or connactivity ke liye yuasabi tip si port diya gaya he
 There are two cameras on the back panel which are in the corner
 elidi flash nahin diya gaya he jo company ko rakhana chahie tha
 There is only one camera in the front and it also has the option of ultra wide
 keyboard kaa dizin or bild quality kaaphi solid he or ise yuj karnaa bhi aasaan he
 The keyboard layout is small, but it is easy to use
 ye baclit keyboard nahin he yani andhere main keyboard lit nahin hogi
 The keyboard also has a trackpad which is quite smooth to use
 haalanki trekkpad main aapako zyada function nahin milte jo ek standard laptop die jate hai
 Display Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 10
 5 inch kii Suner AMOLED disple di gai he
 Its aspect ratio is 16:10
 iskaa rejyolushan (2560X1600) kaa he
 The display is really great and it has been a better experience to use it
 film or siries dekhne kaa bhi anubhav kaaphi acha rahaa he
 Since it has HDR 10+ support, your experience of watching Netflix content will also be good
 screen brit or colorphul he or contrast bhi acha he
 Viewing angles are also correct
 ise aap keyboard se atech karke ise thodaa dur rakh kar yuj karen to bhi aapako isamen verde files yaa koi artical aasaani se pard sakate hai
 If you use it even in outdoor, then its display is such that you will not have any problem with it
 utyub video se lekar gaming tak main isaki disple ne niraash nahin kiya he
 Performance and software Samsung has given the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor to this tablet
 iske saath 8GB or 6GB ram kaa opshan he
 Storage is up to 256GB and you can also increase it through micro SD card
 parformens main koi dikkat nahin he
 The apps work well and multi tasking is also very smooth
 agar aap game freeq hai to isamen gaming bhi achche tareeke se kam sakate hai

 software kii baat karen to Galaxy Tab 6 main Android 9 Pie besd Samsung One UI diya gaya he

 aam taur par ise aneble karke aap keyboard atech karke hi yuj karenge to behatar hoga
 Just like Samsung's smartphones, it has also given you features
 biksabi kaa bhi saport he
 The special thing is that if you have a Samsung smartphone, then you can reply to the call from this tab
 Galaxy Tab S6 ek tablet he laptop nahin or isamen diya gaya dex bhi is tablet ko aisa nahin banaata he jo laptop ko riples kar le
 dex has its own limits and you cannot do all the work with it from a traditional laptop
 dex mod main sabhi eps kaam nahin karte hai or shaayad company dhire-dhire isamen zyada se zyada eps kaa saport degi
 You can only do basic work on this mode
 verde ke liye aap google dock kaa yuj kar sakate hai or kai pregentation eps yuj karke offis ke liye taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Talking about s Pen, it works fine
 isame air acshan or bluetooth kaa saport bhi diya gaya he

 udhaaharan ke taur par iske batan ko press karke selfi bhi clic kar sakate hai
 Overall, it gives excellent performance by mixing software and hardware
 lekin limitesan yah he ki isse aap productvity besd kaam nahin kar sakate hai
 Whether it is photo video advanced editing or you have to do many things at once, it is also not possible to a large extent
 basic kaam ho jayega
 This is great for playing the Internet and social media, for watching gaming, video or movies
 chunki ye teb luk or feel se lekar har department main behatar he to aap ise kahin bhi le ja sakate hai
 As we have mentioned earlier, its display is its specialty
 Galaxy Tab S6 bydaree barrpakhghalady Tab S6 main 7,040mah kii bydaree di gai he
 Battery backup is fine
 puure din kaa byaap aasaani se miltaa he
 Generally the battery backup of the tablet is rarely and if you look at it, it is fine in this case
 puure din kii byaap aap tab hi nikaal paaenge jab aap ise mixd yuj karenge
 Internet browsing, social media, gaming and videos are all average usage throughout the day
 agar aap heavi yuj karenge, kuch ghante lagaataar gaming karenge yaa film dekhenge to puure din kaa byaap nahin milegaa
 Should you buy Galaxy Tab S6? Galaxy Tab S6 is priced at Rs 59,999
 agar aapako tablet kii jarurat he or is keemat par tablet hi khareednaa he to aap ise kharid sakate hai
 But if you hope that by purchasing it, you will also work as a laptop, then obviously it cannot replace the laptop

 But by then the makers would have shot a considerable part of the film

 yah notice marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri kii yachika par jari kiya gaya
 Yechury has alleged that his party's ailing MLA Yusuf Tarigami has been illegally detained
 supreme court ne sarkaar se doctoron kii salaah ke aadhaar par tarigami ko ames dilli shift karne kaa aadesh diya
 Together a member of Tarigami's family was allowed to live together
 seetaram yechuri ne jammu-kashmir ke srinagar daure ke sambandh main supreme court main halafanama daayar kiya tha
 The Supreme Court allowed Sitaram Yechury to visit Srinagar to meet his party's ailing MLA and senior leader Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami
 supreme court ne antarim aadesh diya tha ki mulaakaat ke baad yechuri supreme court main affidavit daakhil karen
 Sitaram Yechury had come back from Kashmir and said that the government is talking about normalcy in Kashmir, but that is not the case
 nai dilli pahunchane par ajtak se hui baatcheet main seetaram yechuri ne kaha tha ki maine na kisi se koi baat kii or na hi kahin gaya

 desh kii siyasat main saal 2019 mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are going through a difficult phase in the current political scenario
 aise main donon siyaasi dalon ke paas 2019 main ek baar phir se apane raajnneeti ko jinda karne kaa mauka he
 It is to be seen that Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati create history by joining hands or become history themselves? The power of the country is decided by Uttar Pradesh
 soobe main sabase zyada loksabhaa siten he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, Narendra Modi won 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the same Uttar Pradesh and held the post of Prime Minister
 modi lahar main sapa apane kunbe tak simat gai thi or basapa to khaataa bhi nahin khol pai
 The result of this was that, forgetting the 23 years of enmity, these two parties joined hands in the by-election of the state and they got the formula of victory
 isi formule ko sapa-basapa 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dohraane ke liye ek baar phir haath mila sakate he
 If Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati enter the electoral fray in alliance, they can once again create a new political history in the state
 darasal, 2014 main modi lahar ke baavjood sapa-basapa 41
 It managed to get 80 percent of the vote
 jabaki bijepi ko 42
 30 percent votes were received
 haalanki, paanch saal main siyaasi sameekaran badale hai
 In the current era, neither is there a Modi-like wave of 2014 nor SP-BSP is in power in the state
 vahiin, centre se lekar pradesh tak kii satta par bijepi kabiz he or vipaksh lagaataar sarkaar ko gherne main juta he
 Modi and Yogi government of the Center may face anti-incumbency wave
 iske sanket soobe kii teen loksabhaa or ek vidhansabha seat par hue upachunaav ke nattejey dete hai, jisamen bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Whereas BJP had previously held these seats
 sapa-basapa ke saath aane se bijepi kii raah 2019 ke loksabhaa chuv main kaaphi mushkil bhari ho jaaegi
 Both parties have a strong vote bank in the state
 soobe main 12 fisadi yadav, 22 fisadi dalit or 18 fisadi muslim hai, jo kul milakar aabaadi kaa 52 fisadi hissaa he
 The SP-BSP is believed to have a strong hold on the vote banks of these three communities
 soobe main 1993 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa-basapa ne gathbandhan kar itihaas rach diya tha
 It is believed that after 23 years, the SP-BSP can once again write a new text of politics by alliance and it will be difficult for the BJP to repeat the 2014 election results
 vahiin, 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main agar sapa-basapa milakar chunavi maidan main nahin utarate hai to phir bijepi kii raah ek baar phir aasaan ho jaaegi
 Actually, this is being said that Akhilesh Yadav is constantly talking about an alliance with the BSP, but BSP President Mayawati is still silent in this regard
 itnaa hi nahin mayawati koun sa siyaasi kadam uthaaengi ye baat puure yakeen ke saath unke sivaa koi nahin kah saktaa he
 According to experts, if the SP-BSP does not form an alliance due to any political reasons, then there may be a danger of their history being made

 Now the top court will decide whether the Constitution bench will decide on the decision to provide 10 percent reservation to the economically weaker people through the 103rd Constitution Amendment

 Therefore reservation cannot be given on this basis

 The grant of 10 percent reservation to the upper castes is also violating the 50 percent reservation limit

 The differences of leadership between JDU and BJP in Bihar: Sanjay Paswan said - Not Nitish, Modi model's leadership differences between Janata Dal United (JDU) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have started to emerge
 khaskar rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) par jediu kaa virodh bijepi ke sheersh netritv ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Therefore, questions are being raised on the leadership from the BJP
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or emelsi sanjay paswan kaa kahana he ki ab bihar main nitish model kii jagah modi model kii jarurat he
 Paswan said that Nitish Kumar gave a chance to Jitan Ram Manjhi, now BJP should also give a chance
 hameshaa bijepi dipti hi kyon rahe
 This statement of Sanjay Paswan is saying a lot in itself
 endie ke kai faislon kaa virodhmaloom ho ki jediu ne endie main rahete hue teen talaak kaa virodh kiya
 Opposed Article 370 and is now opposing NRC
 haalanki, bijepi kaa shuru se ye bhi maananaa he ki bihar ke simanchal main bhi kaaphi sankhya main bangladeshi ghuspaithiye rahete hai, lekin jediu ko rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) pasand nahin he
 Sanjay Paswan further said that while the NRC is being implemented across the country, its allies are in opposition
 jaise jediu ko bolne kaa adhikaar he vaise hi ham bhi bol rahe hai
 Significantly, the Ram temple, Article 370, triple talaq and presently NRC are important issues for BJP and JDU has been opposed on all these issues
 haalanki jediu 1996 se jab inkaa gathbandhan tha tab se in sabhi muddon kaa virodh kar rahi he, lekin ab aisa kya hua ki bijepi ko in muddon par virodh pasand nahin aa rahaa
 'BJP leader should be made CM' However, Sanjay Paswan says that now the public is always accepting the issue

 On these issues, there is a difference between our own team and it does not suit

 Anyway, every common man of Bihar wants to be a Chief Minister of BJP
 susheel modi hon yaa phir nityanand raay ye aise chehre hai jinhen mauka diya ja saktaa he

 For example, if a passenger has started his journey on the train after 10:00 pm, then tickets of such passengers can be checked
 agar kisi rail yatri kii yatra raat ko 10:00 baje se lekar 6:00 baje ke bich hi puri ho rahi ho to bhi uskaa tikat titii check kar saktaa he
 Apart from this, ticket can also be checked in the event that the ticket is not checked after boarding
