 GST, a tax that has been waiting for almost 17 years
 vidambnaa aisi ki satta paksh main congress rahi to bijepi ne virodh kiya or jab bijepi rahi to congress ne
 The Modi government was also striving to implement this tax reform since taking over power but it has now succeeded almost two years later
 30 june kii aadhi raat bharat main bahupratikshit jiesti launch ho jayega
 Today we tell you that the BJP today GST
 
 
 jiesti kar rahi he kabhi usne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 And the Congress which stands facing it today, had first talked about implementing it, he had dreamed of GST
 aapako bataa den ki jiesti jaise kar sudhaar kii shuruyaat bharat main us vakt hui thi jab desh ke pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi the or vitt mantralay sambhaal rahe the purv pradhanmantri vishwanath pratap singh
 VP Singh introduced Modified VAT (MODVAT) in February 1986
 yah kaaphi kuch jiesti jaisaa tha
 This laid the foundation for the only tax system for the country
 pratyaksh or apratyaksh kar main sudhaaron kaa suzav dene ke liye niyukt raja chelia cameti dwaara apni report pesh karne ke baad pi ve narsimha raav kii sarkaar main vitt mantri rahe manmohan singh ne rajya str par vailu aded tex ke bare main shuruaati charchaa shuru kii thi
 Just like when Yashwant Sinha was Atal Bihari Vajpayee's finance minister, it was decided from 1 January 2000 to end the battle of sales tax between states and to keep a uniform rate for sales taxes of various goods
 adhik mahatvapurn baat, karyanvayan kii nigaraanee karne ke liye, sinha ne 2000 main rajya vitt mantriyon kii ek cameti gathit kii thi jisaki adhyakshata tatkaaleen pashchim bengal ke vitt mantri aseem dasgupta ne kii thi
 Dasgupta was the chairman of this committee till 2011
 jiesti ke liye sabase ahm rahaa 2004, jab tatkaaleen vitt mantralay ke salaahkaar vijay el kelkar kii adhyakshata vaali task force ne kaha ki desh kii maujuuda tex system main kai khamiyaan hai
 He suggested a comprehensive GST in the interest of the country though he suggested a minimum rate of 7% for states and a minimum of 5% for the Center
 iske baad desh main samaan tex par nae sire se charchaa shuru hui
 After the defeat of the NDA in 2004 when the UPA came to power and the Manmohan government in P
W
 chidambaram vitt mantri bane to unhone bhi jiesti par kaam jari rakhaa
 He campaigned for the introduction of VAT with the aim of providing financial assistance to the states
 chidambaram ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan sabhi bajet bhaashanon main jiesti laane kaa sanket diya
 He announced the implementation of GST from 1 April 2010
 lekin rajyon ke virodh ko lekar baatcheet raftaar nahin pakad nahin pai
 In 2009, the new Finance Minister of India, Pranab Mukherjee announced the basic structure of GST and reiterated the government's goal of implementing it from 1 April 2010
 2009 main hi aseem dasgupta cameti ne jiesti par apane pehle diskashan paper ko janata ke saamne rakhaa or is par suzav maange
 Taking its important step in February 2010, the UPA government launched a computerization project for commercial taxes in the states
 ise hi jiesti kii neenv ke taur par mana gaya
 In March 2011, Manmohan Sarkar introduced the Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha to implement GST
 vipakshi dalon khaskar bijepi ne iskaa jamkar virodh kiya
 After which the Bill was referred to the standing committee of Parliament headed by former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
 2012 main sthaayee samiti ne is par charchaa kii or kuch hisson par aapatti darj karai
 In November 2012, the then Finance Minister Chidambaram held talks with the Finance Ministers of the states following which a deadline of 31 December 2012 was resolved to resolve all issues
 sabase khaas baat hui 2013 main, agast main sthaayee samiti ne apni report sansad ko saunpi
 The panel gave its approval to the bill with some amendments
 iske baad is bill kaa bijepi dwaara virodh shuru hua
 In October, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi and his Finance Minister protested widely
 gujarat ke tatkaaleen vitt mantri saurabh patel ne kaha tha ki agar manmohan sarkaar adhyadesh laakar jiesti lagu karti he to gujarat ko har saal 14 hajaar karod rupye kaa nuksaan hoga
 With the change of power in 2014, the GST dream remained for the Congress
 lekinmodi or jetlike dimag main bhi jiesti ghar bana chuki thi
 For this reason, in December 2014, the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley introduced the bill in Parliament, just a few months after coming to power
 ab virodh karne kii baari congress kii thi
 Congress demanded that the bill be sent to the standing committee
 may 2015 main lok sabha negistsanvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko paarit kar diya lekin agast main bill rajyasabha main atak gaya
 The Congress openly opposed the GST rate and demanded that it not be more than 18 percent
 baari uthapathak or virodh ke bich modi sarkaar ne bill main chaar sanshodhan kiye jiske baad congress ne is par apni sahmati jataai
 However, the states continued to protest against it
 haalanki sansad ke donon sadanon or bijepi shasit rajyon ke vidhansabha main bill paas hone ke saath gaiyr bijepi shasit rajyon main bhi bill paas hota chalaa gaya or ab vah 1 july 2017 se puure desh main lagu kiya ja rahaa he

 isamen ek vyakti kii maukey par hi maut ho gai or doosraa ghayal ho gaya
 The explosion was so tremendous that someone felt as if a shot had been fired, while someone felt that a gang-war was caused
 lekin thodi der baad hi ye saaf ho gaya ki aisi main gas bharne vaale silendar main blast hua he
 According to the police, the two youths were going to fix AC via Hirankudna via Najafgarh
 jaise hi wo dichaaun gaanv pahunche to achaanak se chote silendar main blast ho gaya
 Raju, who was sitting on the back of the bike, died on the spot, while Pankaj, who was riding the bike, was injured
 philhal jis tarah se ye haadasa hua isse kai sawaal khadey hote hai
 Suddenly how did the cylinder explode in this way? Was it negligence or was there a flaw in the cylinder
 police kaa kahana he ki maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he ki aakhirkaar is haadase kii vajah kya thi police is maamle main jaankaron kii bhi raay le rahi he, taaki blast kii sahi vajah pataa chal sake
 Let us know that cases like blast in LPG cylinder are heard many times, but on the moving motorcycle there will be less cases of blast in the cylinder of gas filling in AC
 yahi baaten kai sawaal khadey kar rahi hai, asi main bharne vaali gas silendar main achaanak blast ne gharon main istemaal ho rahe asi se durghatana hone jaise sawaal bhi khadey kar die hai ki hamaare gharon ke asi main bhari gas kitni surakshit he? In order to make the electoral battle in Delhi triangular, the Congress finally got its trump card running
 priyanka gandhi wadra ne aaj dilli main road sho ke jariye na sirf apni star vailu dikhaai, balki is road sho ke jariye congress ne apni takat bhi dikhaai
 The people of Delhi became desperate to get a glimpse of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 koi balakani main aayaa, koi chhaton par to hajaaron log sadakon par utar aae
 Priyanka described herself as the daughter of Delhi at the road show, and scoffed at Modi by saying what he knew about Delhi
 modi ji dilli 5 saal pehle aae hai or maine 47 saal se dilli kii galiyaan dekhi he
 Priyanka said that from Mehrauli to Majnu's mound, i know all of Delhi
 main dilli waalon ke dil kii baat bataati hum
 Priyanka also challenged Prime Minister Modi from Delhi that if he has the courage, he should show it by contesting on the issue of demonetisation and GST
 uttari purvi dilli loksabhaa seat se pratyaashee or dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke samarthan main priyanka ke is road sho kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 This road show of Priyanka started from Brahmapuri Pulia in Seelampur
 brahmpuri puliya se priyanka kaa kaaravaan shuru hua
 Priyanka accompanied Sheela Dixit in an open bus
 kuch hi dur bas chali ki priyanka upar aa gayi or palathi markar bas par baith gayi
 When the convoy came out, slogans started echoing all over the way
 sadakon par kaaryakartaaon or logon kaa baari hujum umad padaa
 Those who were in their homes, they came in the balconies and from there started showering roses on Priyanka
 priyanka muskuraate hue haath jodakar logon kaa ye swaagat kabool karti raheen
 Finally, Priyanka Gandhi attacked PM Modi fiercely
 priyanka ne kaha, 'ek dilli kii ladki aapako khuli chunauti de rahi he
 Fight the last two phases of elections on demonetisation, fight on GST, fight on the safety of women and fight on the promises you made to the youth of the country and cheat on them

 samaajawaadee party (sapa) ne dal ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav kii ‘aakarshan’ sambandhi tippanee par safai dete hue kaha ki yadav ke kehane kaa matlab shaareerik lubhaavnepan se nahin balki janata ke bich ek rajaneta ke rup main aakarshan se tha
 Referring to the Women's Reservation Bill during a function in Barabanki, Yadav had reportedly said that 'the women of the village will not get so much attraction'
 unki tippanee par sapa ke prantiya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne safai di ki sapa pramukh aisi ochhi baaten nahin karte or unka kehane kaa matlab shaareerik aakarshan se bilkul bhi nahin tha
 He said that Yadav meant that women in urban areas have relatively more qualities to woo voters as a politician whereas most women in rural areas are not able to lure voters to vote due to being illiterate
 
 gauratlab he ki sapa pramukh ne mahila aarakshan vidheyak ke masale par kal barabanki main ek kaarykram main kaha tha ‘agar mahila aarakshan vidheyak paarit ho jaataa to garib or gaanv kii mahilaon ko mauka nahin mil saktaa tha

 yaad rakhana, iske peeche kii baat bataa rahaa hum, aapako mauka nahin miltaa, unke mukaable hamaare gaanv kii mahilaon main aakarshan itnaa nahin milegaa
 The SP chief had said this to emphasize his argument in which he said that the bill related to women reservation will deepen the distinction between urban and rural women

 When the story ends, it seems that the characters' lives and their roles are like these cards

 But the mother corrects him that his father gave him a lot of love and respect

 Readers of that mother can feel themselves

 vakt ke saath badalanaa utana hi jaruri he jitna ki saans lenaa
 Some modern Muslim youths have not only succeeded in making their society understand this but they have made a beginning which is completely new for this society
 do saal pehle, 12 april, 2012 ko ujjain ke yuvaaon ke ek samooh creative soshal foundation ne muslim samaaj kaa pehla parichay sammelan yojit kiya tha
 But even then he had no idea that this event would take such a big form in the coming times and would lead the silent revolution which would bring changes in the society, but only slowly
 aam taur par muslim samaaj ko paradaa karne vaala or rudhivaadee mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that while in other societies, events like introduction conference are common, it is a completely new thinking for Muslim society
 desh bhar ke vivaah yogya yuvak-yuvatiyon kaa saarvajanik rup se parichay sammelan main aana or behatar vikalp kii chaah main manch par apane bare main, apni shaikshanik yogyata ke bare main bataanaa, nai shuruyaat he
 Therefore, when some well-educated people of the society planned a free introduction conference, there was a lot of opposition in the society
 is had tak ki masjidon se iske khilaaf elaan tak hue
 But it was the desire for change that led to more than 1,400 youths and their parents from 12 states across the country attending the event on April 6, 2014
 foundation ke sansthaapak sadsy sarfaraj kuraishi kehete hai, ‘‘pehle saal kareeb 450 biodata aae, lekin duusare hi saal inaki sankhya badhkar 650 se zyada ho gai
 This year, 1,000 registrations had already taken place a week before the event
 yahaan tak ki aayojan ke din maukey par hi 400 se zyada registration hue
 "obviously, the people of the society appreciated and supported this initiative as well
 mandsaur jile ke sitamau se aae ek abhibhavak amanatullah kaazi kehete hai, ''samaaj main shiksha kaa dayera bad rahaa he
 Hence this new platform was needed
 or phir samaaj raktasambandhon ke daayre se bhi baahar nikalnaa chahta he
 He has been in his entire life
 ab behatar vikalp kii talash kii ja rahi he
 Naeem Khan of Ujjain says, "the key in finding a spouse is to see if the mental level is being attained
" samaaj kaa yuva ab zyada padhaa-likhaa he, isiilie aise sammelan kii jarurat mahasoos kii gai
 "by assessing the educational qualifications of the youth coming to the conference, it is clear that education has expanded in the society
" masalan, 2012 ke 450 yuvaaon main kareeb 30 fisadi hyskool yaa usase kam padhe the, jabaki snaatak or snatakottar 50 se 55 fisadi the
 The number of those who left the education column empty was also considerable
 vyavsaayik shiksha praapt karne waalon kii sankhya kaaphi kam thi
 But in 2013, 20 percent of the 650 youth from five states were in high school or lower educational qualifications, while the share of graduates or more educated reached 70 percent
 ise jaagrukta kaa parichaayak hi kaha janaa chahie ki 2014 main 1,400 main se hyskool tak padhe yuvaaon kii hissedari sirf 10 fisadi rahi jabaki snaatak or snatakottar yuvaaon kii sankhya 90 fisadi tak pahunch gai
 Among them were CA, MBA, MCA, ME, mtech, BDS and MBBS
 is sammelan ke peeche ek or kaaran bataate hue sarfaraj kehete hai, ‘‘sabhi samaajon kii tarah muslim samaaj main bhi ladakiyon main shiksha kaa str adhik he
 Availability of similarly educated youth is a problem for them
 isliye kuch bujurg ladakiyon kii shiksha kaa virodh karte hai
 The plan of the conference is an effort to provide better options to such women, so that no reason is hindered in their education
 ’’aayojan main aane vaali ladakiyon kii shaikshanik yogyata dekh unki baat sahi siddh hoti he
 Dhari Shower of Dhar who has done phd or Naela Khan of Indore who has done MBA
 devas kii shaguftaa mirza emessi or emphil kar chuki hai jabaki reva kii rojina siddiki bii hai or emtek bhi kar chuki hai
 There are fewer boys with equivalent education than highly educated girls
 aayojan se shuru se jude narsinghpur ke jila aabkaari adhikari dow
 Shadab Ahmed Siddiqui gives another reason for the positive attitude of the society, "people were comforted that there would be nothing non-shariat in it
" isiilie yuvak or yuvati ek saath ek manch par nahin hote
 The pandals of women are different in which women volunteers handle all the responsibilities from registration, stage operation
 vastav main yahaan vivaah laayak yuvak-yuvatiyon ke abhibhavak mulaakaat karte hai
 This shows that the society wants to come out of the orthodox chola and move towards reform
 ’’kaarykram main bataur mukhya atithi shaamil hue purv saansad or saptahik nai duniya (urdu) ke sampadak shahid siddiki ek mahatvapurn bindu kii ore ishaara karte hue kehete hai, ‘‘baat yah he ki muslim samaaj ab shaadi-byaah or rishton ke maamalon par hi nahin, jivan ke saare sawaalon par nae sire se sochane ko taiyaar he
 He wants to connect with the new age
 chaahe rajnatik soch ho yaa shiksha, muslim samaaj kii soch badali he
 Today there is a hunger for education among the youth
 pehle shaadi aasaani se parivaar ke andar hi ho jaaya karti thi lekin ab nae tareekon ko aajamaane se gurej nahin he
 Like other societies, Muslim society too is adopting it
 ’’ujjain ke in yuvaaon ne desh ke muslim samaaj ke saamne misaal pesh kii he kyonki anya sthanon par aise aayojan kii koi parampara nahin he
 Now people from other states come to see this program exclusively
 ve yah dekhakar achambhit rah jate hai ki yah aayojan kis tarah itane vyavasthit tareeke se kiya gaya he
 In fact, digital screens are installed in many places at the venue, on which the bio-data of the youth is constantly moving
 sammelan main aae sabhi aavedakon ke biodata ko pakhwaade ke bheetar hi sanghathan kii website par daal diya jaataa he
 In the introduction conference, the book of photographs and information related to the marriageable young men and women is made available in the program itself
 khaas baat yah he ki yah sab nickshulk kiya ja rahaa he
 Even registration fees are not charged
 kaarykram kaa sara kharch sanghathan ke sadsy mil-julkar uthaate hai
 Chairman of Madhya Pradesh Kazi Council regarding the event, Dr
 ishrat ali kehete hai, ‘‘samaaj kaa yuva pehle kii tulana main shikshit hua he, logon main jaagrukta bhi badi he
 It is a good thing that the youth are organizing this by putting their money and time, while taking responsibility towards the country, towards the society
 ’’ siddiki kehete hai, ‘‘badlaav kii lahar ujjain hi nahin, deshbhar ke muslim samaaj main he
 Rahul Narayan is seated on a high platform on the edge of an artificial moon landscape at teamindus headquarters on the outskirts of Bangalore
 unki bagal main moon rover kii ek pratikruti he
 It is a complete aluminum-made four-wheeled robot that his team has built and is undergoing final tests
 agar sab kuch thik-thaak rahaa to rover ko disambar, 2017 tak chand kii sataha par chhod diya jayega or yah 500 meter kii duuri tay karte hue prithvi ko uske sabase najdiki khagoleey saathi kii haai-definishan tasviren or video bhejega
 If it succeeds, teamindus will create history in space and will become the world's first private company to not only build a spacecraft and land on the moon but also run a rover on the lunar surface
 teaminds ne is rover kaa naam isie rakhaa he, jo ''ek choti-si aashaa" ke pehle aksharon se milakar bana sankshipt rup he
 But this venture is a very high leap forward in the space to explore the space
 bharat kii numaaindgi karne vaali teaminds duniya kii un paanch companiyon main se he jinhen is janvari main ab tak kii sabase badi antariksh kii nijee companiyon kii spardhaa—google lunar eks prise—main mukaable ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 The other four teams selected for the competition are Moon Express (US), Spassel (israel), Hakuto (japan) and Synergy Moon (an international consortium or consortium)
 2007 main shuru is spardhaa ko google ne pryojit kiya tha or ise is tarah taiyaar kiya gaya tha jisase duniya bhar ke ejiniyaron, udhyamiyon or navonmeshiyon ko nijee kshetra kii rakam se poshit tiimon ke jariye robot se antariksh kii khoj ke saste or kam laagat ke tareeke viksit karne ke liye chunauti di ja sake
 To win the prize, teams must successfully land a vehicle on the moon, travel 500 meters to its surface, and have their photographs and videos brought back to Earth
 tiimon ko yah bhi sabit karnaa hoga ki unke mishan kii 50 fisadi laagat nijee sroton se jutai gai thi
 32 teams competed in the opening match, of which the latter was reduced to 16 with five teams remaining in the final
 mishan ko safalataa ke saath puraa karne vaali pehali team ko 2 karod dollar (120 karod ru
 ) And the team coming in second will get $ 5 million (rs 30 crore)
 ) kaa inaam milegaa
 The amount of the prize may seem quite large
 magar hakeekat yah he ki isse kisi bhi jeetne vaali team kii mahaj ek-chauthai laagat hi vasuul ho paaegi
 (teamindus' account says that his moon mission will cost Rs 450 crore)
 alabatta yah inaam jeetne kaa yaa mahaj final main pahunchane bhar kaa bhi sammaan or gaurav olympic medal jeetne ke baraabar hoga
 Because until recently, the exploration work of the space was limited only to the government agencies and institutions due to the huge cost and the complexities of technology
 haalanki beete saalon ke dauraan america ke neshnal aronutics and spes administration (nasa) ne, or european spes agency (iese) ne bhi, prakshepan yaan or upgrah banane ke kaam main nijee udhyamon ko shaamil kiya tha
 But it has just happened that space technology is truly breaking free from the shackles and domination of government capital and control
 isaki sabase saahasik misaal arbapati udhyami alan misk hai jinhone 2002 main spes eks kii sthapana kii or bahut kam vakt main aise tikaoo antarikshayan banaae jo behtareen se behtareen antarikshayanon kaa muqabla kar sakate hai

 isane unamem se ek ko pichley maheene safalataa ke saath dobaaraa launch kiya tha
 This is the reason why the importance of the current moon race has increased
 yah ek or misaal he ki antariksh praudyogiki ko kis tarah uthal-puthal machaane vaali takatein haank rahi hai jo antariksh ke anveshan or khoj ke liye ek bilkul nae or romaanchak yug kii shuruyaat kar sakati hai
 Rahul Narayan of teamindus says, "we believe that tomorrow's solutions will be found only when we break out of the past, get together and question what is there and connect Joshokarosh and the experience in a new, inspiring way
" 
 "narayan teaminds kii koshishon kaa tulana us bharat se karte hai jo 1983 main apana pehla vishwa cap jeetne kii jaddojahad kar rahaa tha
 The Indian team is considered hidden in the race because it was the last team to write its name for Lunar x Price in 2010, three years after the race was announced
 der se shuru karne ke alaava teaminds ab duniya ke kuch sabase behtareen antariksh praudyogiki anusandhan tiimon ke saath muqabla kar rahi he
 It has been a tremendous journey
 teaminds banane se pehle narayan ko antariksh kaa kul itnaa tajurba tha ki unhen star treks bahut pasand tha
 At that time, it was the only science fiction serial he could see on Doordarshan during his growing up days in Delhi in the 1980s
 1995 main iity dilli se snaatak banane ke baad narayan ne ek software company banaai or saalon chalaai bhi, par ab vinamrata ke saath ve kehete hai, ''uske bare main bataane ko sachmuch kuch khaas nahin he
 "in 2010, at the age of 35, Rahul became impatient about everyday common things and began to get restless about the fact that time was running out to pursue a challenging task
 unheen dinon sanyog se ek lekh unke haath laga jo lunar eks price ke bare main tha
 He wondered why no Indian team is competing in this race of the moon
 ve bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (isro) ke 2008 ke chandra abhiyaan se kaaphi prerit rahe the
 ISRO launched its Chandrayaan with success and also made Moon Impact Probe crash-land on the lunar surface
 bharat ke liye yah pehali aitihaasik kamyaabi thi
 ISRO became the fifth space agency in the world to achieve this feat
 narayan ne apane kuch doston se baat kii or unhone sochaa ki ve saptaah ke aakhri do dinon kii chhuttiyon ke dauraan apane garejon main antarikshayan kaa nirmaan kar sakate the
 He collectively collected $ 50,000 (rs 35 lakh) and sent his application on the last day
 jaldi hi narayan ko ehsaas hua ki unhone kis kadar naammumkin lagane vaale mishan main haath daal diya he—keval praudyogiki ke lihaaj se hi nahin balki team banane or itane mahange udhyam ke liye paisa jutaney ke lihaaj se bhi
 Nevertheless, to get information about how this type of database can be created, he started searching Google and talked to the experts too
 2012 tak unhone ek kor team bana lee thi or chandramaa ke apane mishan kii moti-moti ruparekha tay kar lee thi
 He says, "by then it became clear that it can no longer be merely an amateur venture
" " phir unhen salaah di gai ki ve apni pariyojna ke liye isro ke purv adhyaksh or baad main yojana ayog ke sadsy dow
 K
 kasturirangan kii sahaayta len
 During his tenure at ISRO, Kasturirangan envisaged India's first lunar mission and approved Chandrayaan's project, despite all-round opposition
 unke saath mulaakaat nirnaayak mode sabit hui
 Initially, Kasturirangan took half an hour to listen to teamindus
 magar baithak teen ghanton se zyada vakt chali or kasturirangan aakhirkaar team ke maardarshak banane ke liye raji ho gaye
 He said that there is no way that this project can be done by staying in Delhi
 unhen bangaluru janaa padaa, jahaan isro kaa mukhyalay he, taaki vahaan saalon kii mehnat se sthapit kiye gaye nirmaataaon or vikritaon sahit antariksh praudyogiki ke vishaal buniyadi dhaanche kaa phayda uthaa saken
 He advised them to talk to ISRO and immediately book their launch vehicle ie extended polar satellite launch vehicle, PSLV-XL
 chandrayan ko antariksh main bhejne ke liye isi kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 He also told them to meet the experts in this area and take the retired scientists of ISRO with Chandrayaan and other related projects
 or sabase ahm baat unhone unase yah kahi ki ve kul jamaa chah log is mishan ko puraa nahin kar paaenge or agar ve vakt par kaam puraa karnaa chaahate hai to unhen fouran kam se kam ek sau logon kii team banani hogi
 Asked why he helped teamindus, Kasturirangan says, "we need something that is called the soul of India, which is the spirit of adventure
" meri raay main ye ladke us bharat ke pratik the—ve apni behtareen naukariyon or kariyaron ko chhodkar anjaane andhere main chalaang lagane ko taiyaar or raji the—iske liye asal hikvamat or hausale kii jarut hoti he
 After going through the government system all my life, i believed that the time has come when this kind of experience should be made in many disciplines and many fields in this country
 misaal ke liye, antariksh main hi, jahaan abhi tak hamaare paas keval sarkari dhan se poshit model hi rahaa he
 But as we are growing in investments, in revenue and in experiments, we must have alternative methods to choose from
 udhyamshiltaa or pahal or antariksh ke rahasyon ko sulajhane ke nae tareeke ijad karne kii jarurat he
 "he further says," Vikram Sarabhai (father of Indian space) had said that we need to acquire space technology to make a tremendous leap from backwardness to state of the art
 main maanata hum ki teaminds kii koshish vah duusari jabardast chalaang hogi jo ham samaadhaanon ke bare main sochane or unhen paane ke paaramparik taur-tareekon se puri tarah uthal-puthal machaane vaale tareekon main lagaayenge
 "shortly thereafter in 2014, Narayan decided to leave his software company and move to Bangalore with a small flock of loyalists to realize teamindus' dream
 yah benhtareen kadam tha kyonki vahaan unhen harek kii madad mili
 isro's business arm agreed to sell the PSLV-XL launcher to the Antrix team on the date of their need and also gave them a list of manufacturers and vendors they could meet to acquire subsystems
 isro ke adhyaksh kiran kumaar kehete hai, ''ham maanate hai ki antariksh ke simanton kii khoj karne ke liye hamen harek maukey kaa istemaal karne kii jarurat he or teaminds kii koshish bahut acha ghatnakram he
 "national Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) gave him his guesthouse for use and offered to do some more state-of-the-art tests

 Industry leaders like Nandan Nilekani and Ratan Tata decided to finance the efforts of teamindus
 nilekani kehete hai ki teaminds unhen infosis kii sthapana ke taur-tareekon kii yaad dilaati he, ''ham mahaj kuch noujvaan the
 We had no money but a lot of ideas and the ability to play long games
 " so, jab teaminds unase vittiya sahaayta ke liye mili to vah laagat kaa kuch hissaa (haalanki vah ujagar nahin karnaa chaahate ki kitna) lagane ke liye khushi-khushi raji ho gaye
 "I really like it when Hindustani pursues bold and adventurous goals," says Nilekani, who laid the foundation of Aadhaar

 It was like creating an explosion of innovation and i thought it was such a great idea that it should be supported

 There was also Vivek Raghavan, who worked in the Aadhaar project led by Nilekani and whom he considers one of the pillars of the program

 They were also surprised to see that from the best hardware to start the lunar mission, the software is available in the market, provided the price is paid

 Nevertheless, teamindus can buy fuel tanks, engines and sensors, orbit-prone software, but will have to design the spacecraft, the rover and then mold it to suit their features
 yahi nahin, mishan ke liye kaman or niyantran pranali viksit kerani hogi
 In it Hegde cites a Kannada poet's poem about his role that the new jatas of the tree combine with the old roots to form a more fruitful tree

 Will move towards the moon
 10
 2 km prati second yaa yatri hawaii jahaajon se 12 guna adhik raftaar se badaae vaale antariksh yaan ko chandramaa tak pahunchane main paanch din lagenge
 This is a case of very precise calculations because entering a spacecraft into the moon's orbit is much like 25 km
 dur rakhe ek rupye ke sikke par rifl se nishaanaa lagaana
 New in this is really the case of the spacecraft landing on the moon
 isro ne iske pehle aisa prayog nahin kiya he
 The climate of the moon is the worst
 din main taapmaana pani ke ubalane ke bindu tak pahunch jaataa he to raaten antarctic se bhi thandi ho jaati hai
 One day of the moon is equal to 14 days of the Earth and that is what teamindus is focusing on
 antariksh yaan par lage chote-chote injanon ke chakra se uski raftaar lagbhag shunya ho jaaegi or vah dhire se chandramaa par utar jaaegi
 The team continued to argue whether the vehicle landed on three legs or on four
 aakhir chaar pairon par utaarne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 This makes the spacecraft a little heavier, but it makes the matter more permanent
 teaminds ek saahasik faisle ke tahat antariksh yaan par japani pratidwandvi ke rover ko le jane par raji hui
 This led to some savings in terms of cost
 chandramaa par jab donon rover utar jaaenge to yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki koun pehle 500 meter kii duuri tay karke prithvi par video or tasviren bhejnaa shuru karata he

 We are working on a war footing and as problems arise, we are working out solutions
 yakeen maniye, samasyaayein bhi anek hai
 “fund shortage is also a major headache
 abhi tak teaminds jaruri 450 karod ru
 Only a third of it has been achieved
 isamen 10 lakh dollar kaa vah inaam bhi shaamil he, jo un logon ne janvari 2015 main best moon lander ke liye lunar-10 puraskaar jeeta tha
 These people are now adopting new ways of raising funds
 unki yojana 18 april se baari croud funding muhim chalaane kii he
 500 lakhs from 15 lakh Indians under the slogan teamindus' "moonshot of every Indian"
 chanda maangane kii apil jari karne ja rahi he
 He is expected to earn Rs 75 crore in this way
 jamaa ho jaaenge
 They are also going on a drive to sell the seat on the lander to the control room at the launch
 narayan ko bharosa he ki ve fund kii ek jaruri maatra juta lenge to baaki rakam or sarkari fund aapane aap aa jutegaa
 Now launching is held on 28 December 2017
 is bich isro khud bhi chandrayan-2 agle saal ke shuru main launch karegaa
 It will have a larger rover than teamindus apart from an orbiter, which will carry many things for important scientific research on the Moon

 Annadurai says, "chandrayaan-2 is a logical extension of its first mission but it is a much more complicated mission
 yah lambey samay tak chandramaa par rahegaa or hamen chandramaa kii sataha or sanrachana ke bare main behatar jaankariyaan degaa
 "it is in favor of ISRO that it has manufactured most of the hardware and software of its satellites and launchers on its own and has also worked for the private sector
 philhal, pehali dfa nijee kshetra ke ek samooh ke liye remote sencing satellite ko taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 In other types of satellites, ISRO wants to increase the share of the private sector from the current 30 per cent and strengthen this relationship
 darasal isro kaa chandrayan-1 abhiyaan is sadi ke shuruyaat se chandramaa main badi dilchaspee kaa hi nateeja tha
 The news of the discovery of the moon had started with the space race during the Cold War
 1959 main soviet sangh apane lunaa-2 impactor ke jariye chandramaa par pahunchane vaala pehla desh bana
 Buoyed by Soviet success, the US decided to do better than that and in 1961 President John F
 kennedy ne elaan kiya ki dashak ke ant tak america chandramaa par aadmi bhejega
 Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon on July 21, 1969, through the Apollo mission that began this way
 1976 main jab america ne apollo kaarykram sameta, tab tak chah mishan chandramaa par ja chuke the
 12 astronauts had walked across the lunar surface and six lunar roving vehicles
 iske alaava 380 kilo chattan or mitti chandramaa se dharti par laai ja chuki thi
 The Soviets insisted on a manned mission and sent rovers to the Moon to collect experiments and rock samples
 usne bhi apane chandra abhiyaan ko tabhi samet liya, jab america ne sameta tha
 Now, almost two decades later, countries with space ambitions have taken care of the moon again
 is bich america or soviet donon ne mangal or duusare dur ke grahon tathaa antariksh pindon kii padtaal ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya
 In these missions, scientists realized that if the moon could be made a space launching center, then it could go on to distant missions, sending man to Mars
 vajah yah he ki chandramaa kaa gurutvkarshan apekshaakrit kam hone se vahaan se dur kii yatra ke liye baari antariksh yanon ko ravaanaa kiya ja saktaa he, jinhen prithvi se laanch karnaa sambhav nahin he
 The cost of carrying every kilo of weight in space comes to crores
 isi laagat ko kam karne or antariksh yaan ke adhiktam upyog kii koshish chal rahi he
 Not only this, there has been research that water can also be found on the moon (as the data sent by Chandrayaan shows)
 ise na sirf pahunchane vaale estronaut logon ke liye pine or fasal ugane ke istemaal main laayaa ja saktaa he, balki antariksh yanon ke prakshepan main bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The cold, dark surface of the Moon has an isotopes called Hillium-3, which can provide safe nuclear energy for a Krausan reactor and become an endless source of clean energy
 chandramaa main nai dilchaspee ke is daur main america, rus, china, europe or japan sabhi apane orbitor bhej rahe hai or anusandhan kar rahe hai
 For the fleet commander Narayan of teamindus, the journey to the moon is just beginning
 ve kehete hai, kahawat he ki ''aap basketbaal championships jeet jate ho to club bana lete ho
 "teamindus plans to be a part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution
 narayan kaa maananaa he ki chaahe agali peedi ke jeepies hon yaa arth objarveshan, satellite yaa mausam par niyantran, har maamle main antariksh ahm bhoomika nibhaayega
 If teamindus manages to do what no Indian has been able to do till date, then it will be like a brilliant Nazir for the newly aspirated India
 yah nijee kshetra ke anusandhan or udhyamshiltaa kii bhi misaal banegaa, jisase yuva bharatiyon ko aage badaae kii prerana milegi

 Chief selector of the Indian cricket team MSK Prasad has said that the left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh's return to the ODI and T20 team was no 'gambling'
 haalanki unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki england main 2019 main hone vaale worldcup ke liye yuvi yaa dhoni kii daavedaari ko lekar philhal kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Talking to NDTV after the Irani Trophy final in Mumbai, Prasad said, "it is too early to talk about Dhoni and Yuvraj being part of World Cup-2019
 ham aisi chizon ke bare main abhi baat nahin kar sakate jisamen 800 yaa isse adhik din bache hon
 Prasad said that during the 3–2 win against New Zealand, we were a little worried about the middle order, due to which we called back Yuvraj but it was not a gamble
 unhone kaha ki england ke khilaaf vanade main kedaar jadhav or yuvaraj singh ne jaisaa pradarshan kiya he, usase ab ham adhik aashwast hai
 The presence of players like Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey and Ambati Rayudu in reserve reflects our bench strength
 ’ mukhya chayankarta ne jadhav kii aakraamak ballebaaji kii jamkar tarif karte hue unhen team kaa nayaa finishr qaraar diya
 Team India wicketkeeper MSK Prasad said, 'kedar Jadhav is a little dynamite, i saw him in Lahli during the Ranji match of Andhra vs Maharashtra
 gend gum rahi thi jahaan unki team 40 ran par 6 wicket ganvaa chuki thi vahaan jadhav ne 80 ran banaakar apni team ko jeet dilaa di
 Virat loves to chase runs while Kedar enjoys finishing the match
 haal main india 'e' ke australia tour ke dauraan bhi unhone aisi hi pari kheli, zimbabwe main bhi kedaar kaa pradarshan acha tha main unke liye khush hum
 (read, Wriddhiman Saha said, i do not compete with Parthiv, who did well he will play in the team) Comments is dauraan prasad ne yah bhi sanket die ki riddhimaan saaha hi test maichon main team kii bataur wicketiper ballebaaz pehali pasand honge
 Since Saha was dropped from the team due to injury, the Irani Trophy match was not to test his performance but to test his fitness
 prasad ne kaha, ‘hamane spasht kar diya he ki chot se vaapasi karne vaale khilaadi ko gharelu match main khelnaa hoga or yah uske liye sarvshereshth mauka tha
 We currently have the best number one and two wicketkeepers in the Test as Saha and Parthiv Patel
 fitness parakhane ke liye hi hamane saaha ko yahaan khilaayaa
 It is worth mentioning that Parthiv Patel made a good comeback in the Test, scoring two half-centuries while also scoring a century against Mumbai to give Gujarat the Ranji Trophy title
 saaha ne haalanki irani trophy itihaas kii sarvshereshth pariyon main se ek khelte hue naabad 203 ran banaae jisase shesh bharat ne aaj lagbhag 400 ran ke lakshya ko hasil kiya
 Prasad said, 'all i can say is that Saha was out of the team due to injury and not because he is in poor form
 vah (saaha) newjiland ke khilaaf kolkata test main main of da match tha or usne westeindies main shatak banaaya tha
 'parthiv's wicketkeeping has definitely improved

 ’ He said that we are more confident now than Kedar Jadhav and Yuvraj Singh have performed in one-day against England
 ajinkya rahane, manish pandey or ambati rayudu jaise khilaadiyon kii rigerv main maujuudagi hamaari bench strenth ko darshaati he
 The chief selector praised Jadhav for his aggressive batting and called him the new finisher of the team
 team india ke wicketiper rah chuke emesake prasad ne kaha, 'kedaar jadhav chote dynamite hai, maine unhen andhra banaam maharashtra ke ranjai match ke dauraan lahali main dekha tha
 The ball was spinning where his team had lost 6 wickets for 40 runs, where Jadhav scored 80 runs to give his team victory
 viraat ko ranon kaa peechha karnaa acha lagata he jabaki kedaar ko match finnish karne main majaa aata he
 Recently he played a similar innings during the Australia tour of India 'A', Kedar's performance in Zimbabwe was also good, i am happy for him
 (padhein, riddhimaan saaha bole, parthiv se meraa muqabla nahin, jisane acha kiya vahi team main khelegaa) tippaniyan During this time, Prasad also indicated that Wriddhiman Saha would be the first choice as a wicket-keeper batsman for the team in Tests
 saaha chunki chot kii vajah se team se baahar hue the, aise main irani trophy kaa match unke pradarshan ko nahin balki fitness ko parakhane ke liye tha
 Prasad said, "we have made it clear that the player returning from injury will have to play in the home match and this was the best opportunity for him
 philhal saaha or parthiv patel ke rup main hamaare paas test main sarvshereshth number ek or do wicketiper hai
 We tested Saha here for a fitness test
 ’ gauratlab he ki parthiv patel ne test main acchhee vaapasi karte hue do ardhashatak jade jabaki mumbai ke khilaaf gujarat ko ranjai trophy khitaab dilaane vaala shatak bhi banaaya
 Saha, however, scored an unbeaten 203 while playing one of the best innings in Iranian Trophy history, helping the rest of India reach the target of nearly 400 runs today
 prasad ne kaha, ‘main sirf itnaa kah saktaa hum ki saaha chot ke kaaran team se baahar tha or isliye nahin ki vah kharaab form main he
 He (saha) was the man of the match in the Kolkata Test against New Zealand and scored a century in the West Indies
 ’nishchit taur par parthiv kii wicketcaping main sudhaar hua he
 But Saha's wicketkeeping is better and he scores more than Parthiv
 donon ke bich swasthy pratispardhaa he

 basapa netaa satish mishra ne party kii ore se lokapal bill par apni baat rakhte hue kaha ki majboot nahin majaboor lokapal hoga
 During the discussion on the bill, BJP leader in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that the government has brought a weak Lokpal bill, and the government wants to kill Lokpal in the 'womb' itself
 jetali ne kaha ki is bill ko sanshodhano ke saath paas kiya jaae, or ise paarit kiye bina sadan ko uthanaa hi nahin chahie
 According to sources, Trinamool has clearly said that there will be no agreement on the issue of Lokayukta in the Lokpal Bill

 Ashfaq Arif, the mastermind and mastermind of the attack on the army barracks at Delhi's Red Fort, has filed a review petition in the Supreme Court
 is yachika par aaj yani buudhvaar ko supreme court sunwaayee karegaa
 Let me tell you, earlier the Supreme Court had upheld the death sentence, rejecting Ashfaq's petition

 isi silsile main vah buudhvaar kii subah rajyapal se bhi milenge
 On the other hand, members of the Aam Aadmi Party are furious after Kumar Vishwas, close to Kejriwal, praised Narendra Modi in a television interview
 vishwaas ne pradhanmantri kii tarif karte hue kaha ki narendra modi, manmohan singh ke mukaable behatar pradhanmantri he
 He also praised Modi's visit to Japan and Kashmir tour
 modi kii tarifon ke pul baandhte hue vishwaas ne ek kadam aage jate hue dilli main sarkaar chhodane ke apni party ke faisle par hi anguli uthaa di
 Vishwas said, 'there was not much discussion on this issue, we should have discussed it with the people of Delhi
 'haalanki is bich khabar he ki kumaar vishwaas ko surat ke gau foundation kii taraf se ek kaarykram main shirkat karne ke liye aamantran patr mila he
 Vishwas said, "I have told them about my terms and payment, if they agree, i will definitely attend the program
" kaarykram main pradhanmantri modi kii upasthiti se koi fark nahin padataa or mere nijee maamalon main party kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 On the question of joining the program, Vishwas said, "this will be my personal event and i don't think the party has any role in it
" 'gauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal ne bijepi par vidhayakon kii kharid farokht kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 At the same time, he also lashed out at Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung for seeking consent from the President to invite BJP to form the government in Delhi
 kejariwal ne mangalvaar ko press conference main kaha tha ki uparajyapal bijepi ke liye banting kar rahe hai
 a letter written to the President on 4 September was released to the media by the Aam Aadmi Party
 isamen uparajyapal ke kathan kaa bhi zikr tha, 'isamen jang kaa kahana tha ki chote antaraal main chunaav karana dilli kii janata ke hit main nahin hoga

 It was a period of change in the politics of Delhi
 20veen sadi ke antim dashak main ram mandir puure shabaab par tha
 Meanwhile, in the year 1993 elections were held for Delhi Legislative Assembly
 congress ko maat dekar bhaajapa dilli rajya kii gaddi par kabiz hui
 The Congress could not even recover from the defeat that factionalism after the organizational elections, in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, was defeated and the Congress continued to fall apart
 san 1998 main vidhansabha chunaav hone the or bikhri congress ke paas koi aisa netaa nahin tha, jo sanghathan ko tevar de sake
 In such a situation, the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi gave the command of the party's state unit to a face who was not from Delhi but was not even unknown to Delhi
 punjab main janm hua or desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh se siyaasi safar kii shuruyaat kii
 When Sheila Dixit did the journey of DTC bus for an hour to say the heart, no one had thought that this face would become synonymous with Delhi Congress

 Sheila revived the Congress in a relaxed manner
 kaman sambhalate hi congress ke tevar badal die
 He led many movements against the then BJP government of Delhi
 pyaaj kii nirankush badhati keemat ke mudde par bhi sadak par utarkar sangharsh kiya
 The struggle of Sheela brought color and the issue of onion prices took a national form then
 punjab main janmin, dilli se kii padhai, aisa rahaa 'upi kii bahu' shila dikshit kaa jeevanaukhaad di sushamaa swaraj kii sattashila kaa sangharsh rang laayaa or congress ne sattadhari bhaajapa ko karaari maat di
 The then Chief Minister Sushma Swaraj was successful in winning her own seat, but the BJP was reduced to just 15 seats
 congress ne 52 vidhansabha siten jitkar pradesh main sarkaar banaai or is jeet kii shilpkaar raheen shila dikshit mukhyamantri baniin
 Sheila Dixit was the architect of modern Delhi, had changed the picture of the capital to Delhi politics, and in 1998, Sheila Dixit, who set foot in the politics of Delhi, came and embraced
 pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main vipakshi bhaajapa kii centre sarkaar ke saath bhi talmail banaakar kaary kiya or dilli main vikaas kii nai ibaarat likhi
 The hearts of the Delhiites won such that the caravan of 1998 victory continued in 2003 and 2008 as well
 adhyaksh se shuru, adhyaksh par khatm hua shila kaa safarlgataar teen baar mukhyamantri banakar desh main sabase lambey samay tak mahila mukhyamantri kaa record kaayam karne vaali shila dikshit kaa naata dilli se taumr nahin tutaa
 Sheila Dixit breathed her last at the hospital in Delhi, while she was in the same position as the state Congress president, who started her political journey in Delhi

 shashi tharur ne modi or bhaajapa ke is bayaan ko lekar unki ninda kii ki rahul gandhi ne bahusankhyak bahul kshetron se 'bhaagane' ke liye vynad ko chunaa
 He said that the ruling party has repeatedly tried to spread bigotry
 yah niraashajanak he ki yah pradhanmantri kar rahe hai
 He said, 'the Prime Minister of India should be the Prime Minister of all Indians but, by strengthening his role as a pioneer of the bigotry of the BJP, Modi has hurt the dignity of this principled post
 'tharur ne daawa kiya ki gandhi ne vynad se chunaav ladane kaa faisla aise samay main kiya he jab sahakaari sanghavaad kii bhaavana 'abhootpurv tanaav' kii sthiti main he
 This spirit has kept the country united since independence in 1947
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa nit centre sarkaar main dakshin kii aarthik suraksha or uske raajnneetik pratinidhitiv ke bhavishya ko khatre jaise kai maamalon ke kaaran dakshini rajyon or sangheey sarkaar ke bich sambandh 'lagaataar bigade' hai
 Shashi Tharoor said that in such a situation, Rahul Gandhi has given a 'bold sign' to the effect that he can work as a bridge to bridge the growing gap between North and South in the country
 yah is baat kaa bhi sanket he ki congress pramukh ko uttar or dakshin donon main chunaav main jeet milane kaa bharosa he
 He said, 'can Narendra Modi make such a claim? Do they have the courage to stand for election from any seat in Kerala or Tamil Nadu? 'tharoor, who intends to win the Lok Sabha election for the third consecutive time from Thiruvananthapuram, referred to the' superb response 'rahul Gandhi received in Wayanad and said That it reflects the true spirit of celebration in the South
 yah puche jane par ki vynad se khadey hokar rahul gandhi dakshin bharat ke logon ke liye samarthan kaa jo sandesh dena chaahate hai, kya vah sahi se logon tak pahunchaa he, tharur ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki nishchit hi aisa hua he or is nirnay ke kaaran hi dakshini rajyon main is baat ko lekar utsaah saaf dikhaai de rahaa he ki aglaa pradhanmantri unke kshetra se nirvaachit ummidavaar ho saktaa he
 Asked whether this move could lead to a 'rahul wave' in the south, Tharoor said, 'it has given a new impetus to the party workers working in Kerala especially at the grassroots level and also in the neighboring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 The wave is spreading

 com / zgrfxniuwfgorawalaba he ki dobhaal rashtriya suraksha ke saath-saath kai bade aropiyon ke pratyrpan main bhi badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 It is said that if Christian Michel was brought to India in the middle of the agustawestland bargaining case, it was the hard work of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and his team
 darasal, dobhaal or unki team beete lambey samay se yuai sarkaar se sampark main thi
 However, even after all this, bringing Mitchell (michel) to India was a difficult task
 isaki ek mukhya vajah thi ki mishle kaa britain kaa naagarik hona
 In such a situation, his extradition from another country was a challenge for India
 enditivi ko mili jaankaree anusaar ajit dobhaal (ajit Doval) ne kareeb ek saal pehle hi mishael ke pratyrpan ke liye ek crack team banaai thi
 The team consisted of four members of CBI joint director Sai Manohar
 is team main sibiai ke alaava ro ke bhi adhikari shaamil the
 Please tell that it is believed that Ajit Doval's plan was also behind the surgical strike by India on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir in 2016
 team ke liye us samay mushkil khadi ho gai thi jab mishael ke vakil main dubai kii court main apana paksh majbootee se rakhte hue kaha ki mishael ek british naagarik hai or unhen kisi tisare desh se bharat pratyrpit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 But in September last year, the court rejected all of Mitchell's claims, saying it could be done
 ajit dobhaal ke alaava videsh mantralay ne bhi is pratyrpan main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 According to information received by sources from NDTV, the Government of India was informed about Mitchell's extradition only last week
 bharat ko pehle hi pataa tha ki use 4 disambar ko bharat laayaa jayega
 The Dubai court had issued an order on 19 November regarding extradition but the entire matter was stalled with the approval of the UAE government
 or yaheen par bharat or yuai ke bich beete saal dedh saal main majboot hue rishte kaa phayda bharat ko mila tha
 The Government of India put pressure on the UAE government for Mitchell's extradition
 pratyrpan se teen mahine pehle bhartiya agenciyon ne dubai ko soochna di ki kis tarah se mishael bhaagane kii taiyaari main he or ksal cap or salwar kameez pahanakar agenciyon ko dhokhaa de saktaa he
 Sushma Swaraj's UAE visit was also an important link in this matter
 haalanki isse pehle hi court ne pratyrpan ko manjuuri de di thi lekin rajanyik dawaab ke baad ye kaam jaldi ho gaya
 Explain that India's investigative agencies were successful in the agustawestland VVIP chopper deal case
 court ke aadesh ke baad is maamle ke bichauliye chrishchiyan mishael ko der raat ek privet plane main dubai se bharat laayaa gaya tha
 He was also questioned late at the CBI headquarters
 iske baad patiala house court kii vishesh adaalat (CBI Special Court) main pesh kiya gaya, jahaan se use 5 din kii sibiai hiraasat main bhej diya gaya tha
 The CBI had sought 14 days of custody from the court, but the court approved only 5 days of custody

 sach kahen to ye apmaan he tamaam aalasiyon kaa, aalsee hona bhi itnaa aasaan nahin jitna samaj liya jaataa he
 All the five senses have to be synchronized, if you need to go out in the middle of the night, hold it too, while falling back on the bed, then how can we take the vein of the back while sleeping and take the vein of the back
 aalsee hone ke liye man-vachan-karm se khud ko is yogya bananaa padataa he
 Otherwise, what if you feel like doing some work at the right time every day or make a promise to pick up a friend from the railway station at two in the night? The biggest advantage of being lazy is that the next one gives up expectations a lazy person survives self-aggression of not meeting expectations
 acha thode na lagata he ki gharavaale chilla-chillaakar genhu pisane ko kahen or aap bahaane khojein? aalsee kabhi brands ke peeche nahin bhaagta isliye poonjeevaad ko bhi badhaava nahin detaa, ulte aalsee aughaddani hote hai
 They wear the new T-shirt in reverse when it becomes dirty, and if it becomes dirty on the opposite side, then straighten it
 kisi puraani dhuli bushshart ke badale main nai tii-shart de daalane se bhi khud ko nahi roak pate
 This is the instinct of charity
 aalasiyon ko aksar darpok or naakaara samaj liya jaataa he, jabaki hota uske ulat he, aalsee vyakti aalas mentin karne ke pher main itnaa bahadur ho chukaa hota he ki pani garm karne ke aalas main thanpani se naha letaa he, jis chote raste ko sunsaan maan din main bhi jane ke naam par saadhaaran vyakti baglein jhaankne lagata he
 There laziness defense gets fun even in the fiery night, the greatness of laziness can only be considered lazy and gets absorbed in this laziness worship and makes big inventions
 ek hota he camera, ek ghadi, ek mobile, ek torch, ek calculator kisi aalsee ko paanch chijen sanbhaalane main khiz na hoti, to kyonkar ek mobile main camera, ghadi, torch or calculator samaa jate?chalate-chalate aalasiyon kii sankhya aajkal raajnneeti main bhi bad gai he, kisi badi party main bajaay jindagi bhar khapane ke das rupee chandaa dekar choti party jwine kar use chhod badi party main parachute entry kaa badhata rivaaj bhi isi kaa nateeja he

 On 19 December 1927, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was hanged by the British rulers in Faizabad jail
 unka balidaan aaj bhi yuvaaon ke liye preranastrot bana hua he
 Born on October 22, 1900 in Shahjahanpur, the British tried various tricks to distract Ashfaq from the path of independence, but not one of his tricks was successful
 angrejon ne unase kaha ki yadi hindustan aaazaad ho gaya to us par hinduon kaa raaj hoga or musalamaanon ko kuch nahin milegaa
 Ashfaq's answer to this was that the divide and rule policy would no longer have any effect on the Indians and Hindustan would remain free
 itihaaskaaron ke anusaar angrejon ne ashfaq ko yah pralobhan bhi diya ki yadi vah ramprasad bismil or apane anya saathiyon ke khilaaf sarkari gavaah ban jaaen to unhen chhod diya jayega
 But Ashfaq's motives remained firm and he refused to become a government witness
 vatan hamaara rahe shadakaam or azadahamaara kya he agar ham rahen, rahen na rahen!bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke mahatvapurn hastakshron main se ek shahid ashfaq ullah khan urdu ke azeem shaayar the
 Born in Shahjahanpur, a town in Uttar Pradesh, Ashfaq had dedicated himself to the independence of the country at an early age

 m Karunanidhi, the father of South's politics, no longer lived in this world, but Tamil Nadu politics revolved around him as long as he lived
 unhone dravid munetra kadgam (diemke) kii kaman lagaataar 50 saal tak sanbhale rakhi
 Karunanidhi became a well-known name in South India before his entry into politics
 unhone tamil cinema main apane kalam ke jaadu se sabhi ko divaana bana rakhaa tha
 Earlier, he had agitated against Hindi
 karunanidhike bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah behad mehnatee the
 His memory was also amazing and through his brilliant memory, at the age of 94, he continued to take interest in politics
 unhen raajnneetik ranneeti banane kaa maahir mana jaataa he

 This emotional move of Karunanidhi created a good image among the party workers and people started liking him
 iske baad hi karunanidhi party main kai varisht netaaon ko pachhadkar annadurai ke nirvivaad uttaradhikari ke rup main ubhare or party ke agle adhyaksh ban gaye
 It is worth noting that Karunanidhi did not even join him when Annadurai formed a new party in 1949 leaving the atheist and anti-brahminist leader EVK Ramaswamy or the Dravida Kadagam (DK) party of Periyar

 Subramanian Swamy's entry in the Rajya Sabha has been a blast
 buudhvaar ko pehle din agasta westland helicopter deal main unhone sonia gandhi kaa naam le liya, jis par khub hangaamaa hua
 Though Subramanian Swamy has been behind the Congress for years, but many BJP leaders are also nervous due to his attitude
 swami ke tevar se bijepi netaa bhi baikfoot parasubramanyam swamirajaneta ke saath-saath vakil bhi hai or wo tamaam tarah ke kanoonee daav-pench se waakif hai
 Also, from the day Swami came to BJP, his graph has been increasing in the party
 kai bijepi ke senior saansadon or mantriyon ko dar he ki media main jo unki haisiyat he wo kahin swami hijac naa kar len
 Because from the day Swami reached Rajya Sabha, many big journalists have started giving him expressions
 modi sarkaar main ek rajya mantri ne bataaya ki shapath lene ke duusare din hi swami ne unase poocha ki mangalvaar ko bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak ke liye unhen aamantrit kyon nahin kiya gaya tha? jiske baad mantri ne swami ko samajhane kii koshish kii lekin wo santusht nahin hue
 The minister started feeling uncomfortable with questions from Swami
 saath hi swami ko mil rahe media karvej ne bhi kuch bijepi netaaon kii chintaa badha di he
 Swami is also disturbed by the media coverage of the minister
 a senior minister who always walks out of the number 12 gate of Parliament House and all journalists wait for hours here
 lekin guuruuvaar ko aisa nahin hua
 When the minister came out of the gate, he did not see any journalist coming towards him

 When a reporter reached out to the minister after talking to Swamy and tried to get him to react to the agustawestland case, the minister pointed to Swamy in a pinch

 The minister told the journalist 'enjoy the new Shigufa'
 congress ne swami kii bhashaa par uthaaya sawaalvahin congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad agasta westland maamle par subramanyam swami ke hamale se khafa hai
 He said that Swami uses 'street print language' inside the Parliament which is not correct
 saath hi ek congressi netaa bataaya ki rajyasabha main arun jetali or ravishankar prasad se jaise bade netaa agasta westland maamle ko lekar gambhir nahin hai
 He said that Swamy's entire political journey has been directionless and he is giving his introduction in Rajya Sabha
 congress netaa naam nahin chhapane ke shart par kaha ki aresas ke dabaav main swami is maamle ko tool de rahe hai
 However, Swamy has brought some people on the backfoot in the upper house of Parliament with his attitude

 Shahid Kapoor is busy these days with his upcoming film R


 Rajkumar
 film ke pramotion ke dauraan kai baar shahid se unke nijee jivan or unke lav laaf ke bare main sawaal puche gaye
 Although Shahid always avoids all these questions with some excuse or other, the truth is that such questions hurt him a lot
 asal main in sab kii vajah yah he ki shahid shuruyaat se pyaar ke maamle main analki rahe hai
 He has been in a relationship with three well-known actresses, Kareena Kapoor, Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra
 unhone apane har relation ko kaaphi mahatv diya
 But unfortunately he was not able to be with any of the three girlfriends for long
 shahid ne relationships khatm hone ke baavjood kabhi bhi khul kar apni kisi bhi purv premika ke bare main kisi ke saath bhi charchaa nahin kii
 Shahid believes that love is a very beautiful feeling, whatever happens between two people should remain between them
 shahid kisi ke khilaaf bhi apane man main koi kadavaahat nahin rakhte hai
 He even congratulated Kareena Kapoor and Vidya Balan for their very loving marriage
 philhal shahid puri tarah se single hai or apane kaam par dhyaan de rahe hai
 Although it will be very interesting to see whose turn it is now
 madhyapradesh congress ke vidhayak suresh rathkheda ne kaha ki party ke varisht netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya (jyotiraditya Scindia) yadi nayaa raajnneetik dal banaate hai to vah usamen shaamil hone vaale sabase pehle vyakti hogen
 However, along with Scindia's staunch supporter, Congress MLA Rathkheda from Pohri assembly seat in Shivpuri district ruled out any possibility of Scindia forming a new party
 sindhiya dwaara apane tivetor ekanut ke states se congress party kaa naam hathaaye jane ke baad madhyapradesh ke raajnneetik halkon main atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki vah sanghathan se naakhush hai
 Rathkheda said that although the party is paramount for me and Maharaj (scindia's supporters call him from this address)
 maharaj aisa koi kadam nahin uthaayenge
 For me, Scindia is like a favorite god
 main unka sevak hum
 "rathkheda also said," i have given a statement on repeated scrapping of journalists otherwise i have not had any such thing with Maharaj
 '' isse pehle rathkheda ne is sambandh main ek bayaan dete hue kaha ki sindhiya ke chhodane kii kahin koi sambhaavna nahin he
 He will not go to any other party
 ‘‘shrimant sindhiya ek maatr aise netaa hai jo khud jab chahenge, nai party khadi kar denge or yadi aisa hota he to main pehla vyakti hounga jo unke saath khadaa najar aayega
 Amid the ongoing political discussion about Scindia, former Congress leader and former Olympian Aslam Sher Khan said that Scindia is a strong leader and his abilities should be used by the state unit of the party
 buudhvaar ko harda main patrakaron se baatcheet main purv kendriya mantri ne sindhiya ko khulkar bolne kii salaah bhi di
 Aslam said, "there are a large number of Scindia supporters in the party who can do anything for them
" gwalior-chambal kshetra main congress ko unke prachaar ke kaaran safalataa mili
 This helped Congress to form government in the state
 ''is bich sindhiya ke kareebi maane jane vaale pradesh congress pravaktaa pankaj chaturvedi ne kaha ki rathkheda kii tippaniyan unke nijee vichaar hai
 He said, "scindia has made it clear many times that he is in Congress
 vidhayak ke vichaar ek kaalpanik sthiti par aadhaarit hai
 Former Gwalior MLA Ramesh Aggarwal also said that the speculation of Scindia (jyotiraditya Scindia) leaving Congress is baseless
 agarwal ne kaha, ‘sindhiya congress main hai or ham sab unke saath hai
 Scindia, who lost the election from his family's stronghold Guna Lok Sabha seat earlier this year, has also dismissed speculation about leaving the Congress as "baseless"
 sindhiya ne kaha ki unhone feedback mila tha ki unka states lambaa he or ise chota kiya janaa chaiye
 He then changed his Twitter bio a month ago
 unke twitor baio main pehle likhaa tha, ''purv saansad guna (2002-2019), purv kendriya urja mantri; purv rajyamantri vaanijya or udyog, purv rajyamantri sanchaar, iti or post'' sindhiya ne haal hi main apana states badalakar sirf ‘‘lok sevak or cricket utsaahi'' likhaa he
 On the Amritsar train accident, even though the railway says that there was no mistake on their part, Navjot Kaur, wife of Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, is now blaming the railway staff and administration for the incident

 navjot cor ne apane bare main kaha ki jab ravan dahan kaa kaarykram hota he to aapako dhyaan nahin hota he ki baahar ke log kidar hai? navjot cor ne kaha, "aapane dekha hoga sab log vahaan khadey hokar video bana rahe the, yahaan tak ki jo peeche the unhen nahin pataa tha ki aage kya ho gaya
 "navjot Kaur blamed the railway for the incident and asked whether it did not show the gateman that people were on track
 unhone kaha, "railway kaa jo banda phatak band kar rahaa he usko dikhaa nahin ki train aa rahi he
 
 
 Trains are on track
 
 
 wo to vahiin tha naa

 That fellow did not know that Ravana has been there since morning
 
 
 "bataa den ki joda phatak main hue is kaarykram main navjot cor chif guest thim
 Navjot Kaur may be blaming the railways for this program, but the Railways has not given it its responsibility
 rail rajya mantri manoj sinha ne kaha ki ghatnasthal se getman 300 meter dur tainaat tha, use ghatnasthal ke bare main jaankaree kaise hoti
 He said that the administration and event organizers for the Dussehra program near Joda Phatak were not informed to the Railways

 Controversy over former CM Arjun Singh in place of Chandrashekhar Azad's statue accused of insulting Chandrashekhar Azad's statue on Kamal Nath government
 The controversy has deepened over the installation of statue of former Chief Minister Arjun Singh in place of Chandrashekhar Azad's statue in Rajdhani

 At the same time, descendants of Chandrashekhar Azad say that the Kamal Nath government is insulting the statue of Chandrashekhar Azad

 On this, Amit Azad says that he does not mean politics but when the statue of Azad ji has been removed in the name of traffic and development, then why the statue of Arjun Singh there now? According to Amit Azad, he just wants Arjun Singh's Put the idol elsewhere
 bijepi ne bhi chandrasekhar aaazaad kii pratimaa kii jagah arjuna singh kii pratimaa lagane kaa virodh kiya he

 India has accused the Pakistani military of the attack and to confirm this, it has stated that there have been 120 incidents of ceasefire violations in 2012

 The inhuman act of infiltrating the border and killing the soldiers and taking their severed heads like a trophy has become the nature of Pakistanis
 is tarah ke hamalon ko ab tak gopneey rakhaa jaataa tha
 As a result, they would have been separated from such incidents or they would have been veiled in the name of death in skirmishes on the border

 a statement issued by it said, "pakistan is ready to conduct a UN military observer investigation on the issue of recent ceasefire violations along the Line of Control
" ’’usee din islamabad main pakistani videsh mantralay ne bharat ke up-ucchayukta ko bulaakar pakistani chaowkee par bhartiya sena dwaara kiye gaye hamale kii shikaayat kii, jisamen ek paak sainik ke marane or ek ke ghayal hone kii baat kahi gai
 This is to say that the beheading of soldiers was a response from Pakistan
 yah badale kii bhaavana se prerit tha
 Most worrying is the Pakistani Special Services Group (SSG) commandos disguised by the Border Action Team (BAT) crossing the loc and killing the Indian soldiers
 sena ke ek adhikari kehete hai ki bat ke hamale bhaawanaaon ke aaveg main nahin hote
 They occur only after identifying the weak spots by studying the line of control

 In February 2000, seven months after the Kargil War, the Indian Army had to face a new vandalism
 pakistan kii bat team ne rajouri jile ke naushera ilaake main ghaat lagaakar saat bhartiya sainikon ko maar daalaa
 Then the Indian soldiers were stunned to see the dead body of a jawan
 ghatana kii jaanch hui, lekin report se sainik bhousaheb talekar kii laash se sir ke kate hone kii baat hataa di gai
 But after interrogating a captured terrorist, it was found that the head of the enemy in Pakistan is considered as a trophy
 usne yah bhi khulaasa kiya ki vah bhi us hamalavar dal kaa sadsy tha or un logon ne saath laae sainik ke sir se footbal khelaa tha
 Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir wrote that the attack was led by Ilyas Kashmiri, a former SSG commando
 vah baad main huji kii 313 brigade kaa pramukh bana or 2011 main america drone hamale main maaraa gaya
 Such incidents were halted by the 2003 ceasefire, but it is believed that the continuation of the beheading of the attacks continued unabated

 Last August, a discussion spread in the Indian Army mess

 The attack was said to have taken place in July 2011 as a retaliatory action after Indian soldiers were beheaded
 haalanki bhartiya sena july, 2011 kii ghatana ke saath hi uske badale ke liye kiye gaye kisi bhi hamale ko sire se khaarij karti he
 There was no such report from Pakistan either, which suggests that such an incident took place
 sainya adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki dushman kaa sir kaat lenaa pracheen yudhkalin ranneeti he
 It was used to terrorize the enemy army, thereby weakening them psychologically

 Pakistani Taliban use video beheading against Pak troops in Waziristan
 pichley june main taharik-e-taliban pakistan ne ek video jari kiya, jisamen 17 pakistani sainikon ke sir kate shav dikhaae gaye the
 This incident of Pakistani soldiers beheading Indian soldiers has also put a question mark on Pakistan's honesty towards the peace process
 aisa isliye bhi hua ki bhartiya sena ne is ghatana ko saarvajanik karne kaa faisla kiya
 "the army had to confirm the incident as it was difficult to hide the mutilated bodies from the family," said a senior military officer

 The Government of India does not appear to be in a mood to give weight to this matter

 com / m8zwl0pgct— BCCI (@BCCI) September 7, 2018 a 2-3 result for India will be better than 1-4 and the team is desperate for a Test win
 mukhya kocharavi shastrine yah kahkar team kaa manobal badhaane kaa prayaas kiya he ki yah pichley 15 saal main videshi dauron par jane vaali yah sarvshereshth team he
 However the facts do not prove it
 gavaskar ne shastri ko bhartiya team ke pichley videshi record kii yaad diliaankade dekhen to saurav ganguli kii captaini main bharat ne england (2002) or australia (2003-04) main siries drow karwaai or westeindies main team test match or pakistan main siries jeetne main safal rahi
 Under the leadership of Rahul Dravid, India won the series in the West Indies in 2006 and England in 2007 and in South Africa, the team managed to win a Test

 After losing two consecutive series in South Africa and England, the myth of the team doing well on the overseas tour has broken, and Team India has failed to prove that it is capable of winning the series outside the subcontinent
 kohli kii team haalanki 2018 main donon videshi siries ganvaane ke baavjood ab tak apni sheersh test ranking bachaane main safal rahi he
 The team combination is once again a topic of discussion

 IND vs ENG: From today, when and where to watch the last Test, the inclusion of Prithvi Shocko in the live streaming test team shows that the Indian selectors are eyeing the option of the openers
 murali vijay ke team se baahar hone ke baad chayankartaaon ko apni yojanaayen jald hi pukhta kerani hongi, kyonki team disambar main australia daure par jaaegi
 It is believed that Prithvi should be tested against the best bowlers of international cricket
 agar vah is ekmaatr test main vifal bhi rahete hai to bhi 18 saal kii umr ke kaaran unke paas dobaaraa aage badhane kaa paryaapt samay hoga
 If he is successful, then the problem of the opening pair for the tour of Australia can be solved
 duusari taraf kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki shikhar dhawan or lokesh rahul kii maujuuda salaami jodi ko barkaraar rakhaa janaa chahie
 If the selectors have their eyes on the future, this will be the last chance for either of them to impress before the series against the West Indies and the start of the first-class season at home
 shuruaati sanket hai ki prithvi ko maukey ke liye kam se kam gharelu satr tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 Ravindra Jadeja may get a chance to play the first Test on the tour as Ravichandran Ashwin did not bowl on the net on Wednesday, while his movement also showed a problem

 dilli main ek 11 saal kaa maasoom ajeeb uljhan main he
 a secret arose in front of him that suddenly the innocent was separated from his parents who had raised him for almost 10 years
 ab uske saamne wo log khadey the, jo khud ko uske asli mata-pita bataa rahe the
 This picture of changing relationships is from Seelampur, Delhi
 saal 2007, silampur kii rahane vaali farida khud ke ilaaj ke liye aspataal ain hui thim
 Farida also had a one and a half year old innocent Shabav in her lap
 aspataal main marijon kii kaaphi bheed thi isliye farida ne kuch der ke liye apane bete ko paas hi rakhi ek teble par sula diya
 But the next moment, Farida was completely unaware of what was going to happen
 farida kii najar jab kuch der baad teble par padi to uskaa betaa teble se gaayab tha
 Farida's senses fly away
 ghabaraai farida shabaav ko idhar-udhar talashti he lekin uskaa kuch pataa nahin chalata
 Shabav was kidnapped
 police shabaav kii kidnaping kaa maamla darj karti he
 Shabaw's parents take photographs showing their innocent photos and start searching the streets to find him
 raah takate biit chuke the das salashbaav kii raah takate hue ab das saal biit chuke the, lekin shabaav ab bhi apane mata-pita kii najaron se ojhal tha
 There is hardly any place in Delhi that his parents have not seen in search of him
 pareshaan maa-baap tamaam mandir-masjid gaye, har baar upar vaale kii dar par bete ke mil jane kii fariyaad lagaate
 Everyday parents take a picture of Shabav and leave the house in the hope that they are right and wrong, somewhere, they get their letters and liver
 album kii ek tasviir ne khol diya rajmagar din guzarane ke saath hi har ummid dam tod detii thi
 He believed that the house of the above is late but not dark
 hua bhi kuch aisa hi jiske bare main shabaav ke maa-baap ne kabhi sochaa bhi nahin tha
 In May this year, she was shocked when she saw a wedding album by Farida
 agle hi pal ankhon main aansu liye farida ne apane pati ko jo bataaya wo hairaan kar dene vaala tha
 Actually there was a picture of Shabav in that album
 shabaav ab samir ban chukaa thama-baap ne fouran isaki jaankaree police ko di
 The police reached the house where Shabav was known by some other name
 shabaav kaa naam badal chukaa tha
 He was now known as Sameer
 vahiin police is baat keetsdik karnachahti thi ki samir hi shabaav he, kyonki baccha ab takreeban 11 saal kaa ho chukaa tha
 His appearance and appearance had changed
 police ko chaanbin main pataa chalaa ki samir silampur ke emsidi skool main pard rahaa he
 Strictly questioned, Sameer's parents - Bapfarida and her husband had told the police that Sameer is their son Shabav
 jiske baad police ne samir ke mata-pita nargis or samim ko kabje main lekar sakhti se poochtacha kii
 He broke down in the interrogation and was stunned to hear what he revealed
 donon aaropee pati-patni ek aise jurm ke mujrim the jisane rishton ko to sharmasaar kiya hi tha balki apane sukh or aulad kii chahat main ek maa-baap ko das saal unke kaleje ke tukade se dur rakhaa
 There were no children, so they had done their Germanism and Shamim
 unhone bataaya ki unhen koi aulad nahin he
 In the wish of children, he committed this crime
 philhal donon ko police ne giraftaar kar liya he
 The innocent Shabaw is strangely confused after this entire sentence
 vah samaj nahin paa rahaa he ki wo ab kise abbu-ammi kahegaa, kyonki jo ab tak use apni palkon par bithaae rakhte the, uski har khwaahish puri karte the, wo abbu-ammi ab salaakhon ke peeche khadey the
 However, Farida and her husband are very happy to find their son Shabav
 jald hu kanoonee prakriya puri hone ke baad shabaav apane asli mata-pita ke saath hoga

 desh-duniya or khaas taur par college campases main hameshaa yah bahes hoti rahati he ki koun intellegent he or koun nahin

 agar aapane beemaa karaayaa he or uskaa premium nahin de paae hai to aapke paise doobane kaa ab khatra nahin he
 Insurance regulator IRDA has decided to make a major change in the insurance sector for the benefit of customers
 ab april maheene se aisi vyavastha ho jaaegi ki beemaa dharak yaa uske dwaara namit vyakti policy ke bare main aasaani se jaan sakegaa
 According to an English newspaper, the regulator has asked insurance companies to put information on the names and addresses of policy holders and the amount of maturity, etc
 on their website
 iske alaava unhen yah bhi jaankaree deni hogi ki pichley chah maheene se kitni raashi jamaa (anclimd) he
 In fact, insurance companies have thousands of crores of rupees from the insured
 2011-12 main yah raashi 4,865 karod rupee thi jabaki 2012-13 main yah raashi badhkar 3,037 karod rupee ho gai he
 The reason for this is that the money of the insured is lying in the companies
 logon ne jis uddeshy se ye policiyaan kharidi thim vah bekaar ho gaya he
 India First Life Insurance MD p Nandagopal said that now the policy holder or his nominee will be able to get all kinds of information about his policy
 iske baad vah bakaayaa raashi kaa daawa kar sakenge
 This will reduce the risk of their money sinking
 bahut se log aise hote hai jinaki policy kaa original cover gum ho jaataa he
 This causes them a lot of trouble to claim
 is maamle main mrit vyaktiyon ke ashrith to bilkul laachaar ho jate hai
 They do not understand anything
 lekin ab nai vyavastha ke tahat website par sari jaankaree aa jane se samasya khatm ho jaaegi
 In such cases, the nominee will give all the information to the insurance company such as the date of death of the insurance holder, the reason, etc
 uske baad vah clem form bharkar bhi degaa
 After this, the insurance company will take necessary steps
 IRDA ne beemaa companiyon se yah bhi kaha he ki vah policy se milane vaali rakam ko bimaadharak yaa uske namit vyakt ke khate main sidhe bhej de
 Apart from this, insurance companies will arrange electronic transfers so that people do not have to go to the office of the insurance company to take the check

 Ishrat Jahan encounter case has revealed a lot
 70 minute ke audio tepe se gujarat sarkaar main hadakamp machaa hua he
 This is an audio tape of a confidential meeting held in Ahmedabad on 18 November 2011, in which several top officials including the Home Minister of Gujarat were present
 tepe ke majamoon se ye baat saamne ai he ki is baithak main ye ranneeti ban rahi thi ki kaise ishrat encounter cese kii jaanch ko bhatakaaya jaae or esaiti ko duusari exiaar darj karne se roka jaae
 Know the sensational disclosure of Ishrat encounter case for the first time
 
 
 15 june, 2004ahmedabad ke paas haive par ek sansanikhej encounter hota he
 Four people are killed
 marane waalon main ek college kii chaatra ishrat jahaan thi
 a variety of questions arose after the encounter and six years later the Gujarat High Court set up an SIT to investigate its truth
 jab esaiti apni report daakhil karne kii taiyaari kar rahi thi tabhi ahmedabad main ek top sikret baithak hoti he
 It is said that this strategy was prepared in the meeting how to prevent the second FIR from being registered in this case
 is baithak main nau log shariq hue the
 The characters of this meeting are now under the scanner of the CBI after the tape was revealed
 audio tepe ko sunne ke baad ye saaf ho jaataa he ki kaise november 2011 main gujarat ke grahamantri khud esaiti report ke nattejey ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 In the tape, Gujarat Home Minister Praful Patel says, 'I have helped as much as i could
 ' baatcheet main wo aage kehete hai ki kaise unhone khud jaanch adhikari ko bulaayaa or unhen prabhavit karne kii koshish kii
 Praful Patel says, 'I, knowing that there is so much danger in it, called Satish Verma at my house and talked with him for over 4 hours
 maine unase in 18 logon kii madad karne ko bhi kaha or agar aap ye karte hai to ye badi baat hogi
 The Home Minister is also the head of the state police
 lekin audio tepe main vahi mantri insaaf ke raste main adnga daalane kii koshish karte, jaanch ko fiks karne kii koshish karte najar aae
 But more happened in the top secret room that day
 jaaniye aage kii baatcheet main kaise tab ke edwocket general camel trivedi aaropee jiel singhl ke vakil rohit verma ko ye salaah de ki court main bachaav kii ranneeti kya ho
 Trivedi says, “we have been discussing the report which may come on 21 for the last several hours
 ek pal ke liye maan lo ki ye report hamaare khilaaf he
 First of all, know that we should talk through lawyers, the government cannot speak at all times
 is vakt aapako khud apni aawaaj buland kerani hogi
 One advice is that we should have 3 lawyers
 nirupambhai to hai hi, suryaprakash raju, tarun barot kaa cese dekhenge jabaki baaki logon kaa ke bharat nayak ko dekhnaa chahie
 'kamal Trivedi further says, you can contact these three and i will also talk
 maan lo report saamne aati he or court kahati he ki report dekhakar pehali najar main encounter farji lagata he
 As this court says, it should be opposed, perhaps we would like to evaluate this report and for this we need some time
 ham yah bhi chahenge ki hamen is report kii ek copy di jaae taaki hamaare paas jo kuch bhi tathy hai, ham adaalat ke saamne laa saken
 However, this court has to decide what to do
 is tarah hamen hafte yaa 10 din kaa time lene kii koshish kerani chahie
 'he is the then Advocate General of Gujarat who was strategizing to rescue the accused policemen
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki aaropon ke ghere main gujarat sarkaar nahin balki kuch police vaale the
 In such a situation, why was the Advocate General of Gujarat involved in the defense strategy of the accused? During 70 minutes of conversation, on some occasions the AG and others also made wrong comments about the judges hearing the case
 ek maukey par to agi camel trivedi ne cese kii sunwaayee kar rahe jaj ko lekar abhadra tippanee bhi kar di
 From the people who were present in the meeting in the secret and the details revealed by the tape, it is clear to what extent the Advocate General and the Home Minister of the state were trying to stop the second FIR and further investigation
 sawaal uthta he ki kyon? aakhir ye bade police afasar or mantri farji encounter ke aaropee police waalon ko bachaane kii koshish main kyon lage the? kya sirf is dar se ki kahin us badi sajeesh kaa khulaasa naa ho jaae jo is farji encounter ke peeche rachi gai thi?tepe main sirf itnaa hi nahin he
 The taped conversation reveals that GC Murmu, an IAS officer close to Narendra Modi, was also present at the meeting, who was then associated with the Chief Minister's Office as a secretary
 aaj bhi wo isi pad par hai
 In this tape you can hear the voice of Murmu, who was discussing how to suppress the investigation
 baithak kii audio ricarding se jaahir hota he ki baithak main maujuud log ye maan chuke the ki esaiti ishrat jahaan encounter ko farji ghoshit kar degi or iskaa matlab ye hoga ki isamen shaamil police waalon ko aapraadhik cese kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Yet these powerful politicians and government officials were making every effort to influence further investigations
 - aakhir gujarat sarkaar kis baat se pareshaan thi?- gujarat kii puri mashinari nai jaanch ke khilaaf kyon thi?- kya sirf isliye ki aage kii jaanch se or badi sajeesh kaa khulaasa ho saktaa he?- aisi sajeesh jiske lapete main bade siyaasi naam bhi aa sakate hai?baatcheet se jaahir hota he ki sikret meeting main maujuud log cese ko pota court main bhejnaa chaahate the
 It seems from his talk that he was confident that he would be able to suppress the case in the POTA court
 jaaniye aaropee police afasar jiel singhl ke vakil rohit verma ne us baithak main kya kaha tha
 Rhit Verma says, 'the moment they file the report in Port Court, the ball will be in our court
 hamen kisi tarah esaiti ko pota court tak le janaa hoga
 You will do that much Sir, the rest is a legal bet so much that neither POTA court will be able to take cognizance or do anything
 aise hi chalata rahegaa, 2 saal, 4 saal, 5 saal
 There are so many legal complications, this case should be closed
 'ek privet vakil kaaryvahak edwocket general jaise gujarat sarkaar ke top kanoonee afasar ke saath baithkar ye ranneeti taiyaar kar rahaa he ki cese ko kaise pota court main transfar kiya jaae
 But, that was not enough
 kaaryvahak edwocket general camel trivedi ne meeting main maujuud logon se ye bhi bataaya ki unhone esaiti ke kaamkaaj ko kaise kaabo main rakhane kii koshish kii
 Kamal Trivedi says, 'I have told him, talked to him, i advised him to retire
 
 
 
 
 sahi he murmu? besharm aadmi kahata he ki agar maine use demote karne kii koshish kii to wo sabase pehle sara khulaasa kar degaa
 You saw how the acting Advocate General calls a member of the SIT in his chamber and asks him to step down
 yahaan baat mohan jha kii ho rahi he jo gujarat hoicourt ke aadesh par bani esaiti ke teen sadasyon main ek hai
 Listen to this conversation once again
 baatcheet ke kram main camel trivedi ne narendra modi ke taqatvar sachiv jisi murmu kaa naam bhi liya
 Murmu was also present in this meeting and his voice is also in the tape
 audio ricarding se sabit hota he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke sachiv bhi ishrat jahaan cese main aage kii jaanch rokane kii koshish main shaamil the
 When natural calamities come, not only humans but also the habitation of the gods come under threat
 aisi hi naubat uttarakhand ke gadhwal main tab aayi jab alakananda nadi ke bhukataav kii jad ek puranic hanuman mandir main aa gaya
 But to avoid the loss of life and property, the people shifting from here did not forget to shift to their favorite deity
 khabar he ki gadhwal se kuch dur sthit parasu main alakananda ke bhukataav kii jad main aae puranic hanuman mandir ko dhahne se pehle hi shift kar diya gaya
 It is worth mentioning that a hydroelectric project here was on the verge of collapsing under the mythical Hanuman temple due to the rapid flow of the Alaknanda River coming in the lake of the dam
 is vajah semandir kabhi bhi nadi ke tej bahaav main cat kar dharashayi ho saktaa tha
 The comments lekin yahaan ke sthaneey nivaasiyon ne 10 ghante kii mashkkat ke baad mandir ke garbhasthal ko todakar hanumanji kii pratimaa ko baahar nikaala
 At present, the statue is kept in a temporary temple on the banks of the Badrinath highway passing through Farasu village till permanent arrangements are made
 ek gramin ne bataaya ki hanumanji ke is prakaar shift hone se yahaan ke log dukhi hai,varsh 2013 kii aapadaa main bhi is mandir ko aisa khatra nahin hua ki use shift karnaa pade
 He also told that until the statue was shifted, devotees kept doing bhajan-kirtan in the temple premises to encourage people engaged in temple shifting work
 lekin janmaal ke nuksaan se bachane ke liye yahaan se shift kar rahe log apane isht devtaa ko shift karnaa nahin bhuule
 It is reported that the legendary Hanuman temple, which came under the influence of Alaknanda's earthquake in Farasu, some distance away from Garhwal, was shifted before it collapsed
 ullekhneey he ki yahaan kii ek jalavidyut pariyojna baandh kii jhil main aa rahe alakananda nadi ke tej bahaav se is puranic hanuman mandir ke neeche lage pusht dhahne ke kagaar par aa gaye the
 Due to this, the temple could have been razed and cut in the fast flow of the river at any time
 tippaniyan But the local residents here after 10 hours of effort broke the temple's womb and took out the statue of Hanumanji
 vartmaan main sthaayee vyavastha hone tak vah pratimaa parasu gaanv se guzar rahe badrinaath haive ke kinare asthaayee mandir main rakhaa gaya he
 a villager said that the people here are saddened by Hanumanji's shift in this way, even in the disaster of 2013, this temple did not face such a threat that it had to shift
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki jab tak pratimaa shift nahin ho gai, tab tak mandir shifting ke kaary main lage logon kii hausala-afjai ke liye mandir parisar main shraddhalubhajan-kirthan karte rahe
 It is worth mentioning that a hydroelectric project here was on the verge of collapsing under the mythical Hanuman temple due to the rapid flow of the Alaknanda River coming in the lake of the dam
 is vajah semandir kabhi bhi nadi ke tej bahaav main cat kar dharashayi ho saktaa tha

 punjab ke sah-maalik ness wadiya ne hoj kii niyukti par kaha, 'hamane bread hoj ke saath teen saal kaa qaraar kiya he
 He will be our head coach
 viru (sahvaag) bhi nideshak ke rup main jude rahenge'
 The Punjab team has managed to make it to the finals only once in the IPL
 abainternetke dada kaa daur aa gaya he
 He has whips to kill in his hands and fetters to wear on his feet
 soochna praudyogiki kanoon 2008ke niyamon kaa nayaa masauda nishchit taur par internet seva pradaataaon or uske upabhoktaaon ke liye mushkilen badhaane ja rahaa he
 The new rules seem absurd to internet content creators, from cyber cafes and wi-fi spots to consumers
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki in par nigaraanee rakhana or inhen lagu karnaa asambhav hoga
 In a country where there are 100 million Internet users and information technology is expanding rapidly, the move has caused widespread outrage
 khufia reporton main bataaya gaya he ki aatankwaadi gut lashkar-e-tayba ne 26 november, 2008 ko mumbai par hamalon kii vaastavik yojana banane ke liye internet kaa istemaal kiya tha
 a month after the incident, the new draft law was reportedly a hasty step to protect India's interests
 soochna praudyogiki kanoon ke peeche haalanki manshaa acchhee thi lekin isamen sarkaar kii dari hui maansikta jhalak rahi he
 It seems superficial that this law is related to the protection of citizens and their privacy, but the way the notification was issued last month, the intention of controlling the Internet is more visible
 aisa lagata he ki sarkaar rashtriya suraksha ke naam par apni dhauns dikhaanaa chaahati he
 These rules are an attempt to curb those who give information on the Internet, which seems to go against the government
 internet kaa istemaal karne waalon kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar jabaki 'rashtriya aapadaaon' ke dauraan internet band karne ke ek taqatvar batan se khud ko las karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he, tab kisi tarah kii chhot lene kii gunjaaish bahut kam he
 After studying the new rules, information technology experts say that their concern is that these rules are not clear
 ye 'janhit' yaa bharat kii 'akhandta' ko banaae rakhane ke naam par sarkaar ko jaankariyon ke aadan-pradaan main roak lagane kii takat de denge
 Recently due to the mass movement in Egypt and Libya, the governments there were not able to close websites and social networking sites in time
 ''duusare deshon ke saath sambandhon ko kharaab karne vaali'' yaa ''kisi raashtra kaa apmaan karne vaali'' saamagree sareekhe vargeekaran ab niyamavali kaa hissaa ban chuke hai or saaf taur par sarkaar ko adhikaar dete hai ki jab paristhitiyaan aspasht hon tab vah daman kaa sahaara le
 Digital media analyst Nikhil Pahwa says, "there is a danger in implementing these rules
 meri chintaa he ki kal agar mana jaae ki vikiliks jaisi site duusare deshon ke saath bharat ke sambandhon ko prabhavit kar rahi he, to kya us par roak lagaai jaaegi?''nae niyamon main web kii saamagree taiyaar karne vaale vyakti kii jaanch or use nae sire se seemaa main baandhna shaamil he
 All 'representatives' including cybercafé owners, web hosts and service providers will now be responsible for the online content used by their consumer
 niyamon main in sabhi ke liye yah bhi anivaary kar diya gaya he ki agar koi sarkari agency upabhokta ke bare main jaankaree maangati he to unhen uske bare main puri jaankaree uplabdh karaani hogi
 This is a rule that will force the service provider to disclose confidential information about the consumer in case of any crime
 nae niyamon main in pratinidhiyon se apeksha kii gai he ki ve ''nuksaan pahunchane vaali, pareshaan karne vaali yaa 'ishaninda vaali'' soochna lene se bhi upabhokta ko roke
 But who will decide what is going to harm and what causes blasphemy? Even if you want to watch youtube on your smart phone, you may have to provide a photo and proof of identity
 nae niyamon ke anusaar, saamaanya kaamkaaj ke liye agar koi bhi vyakti kisi jagah se kisi ko bhi internet kii suvidha de detaa he to use sibar cafe mana jayega
 This includes facilities found at airports, restaurants, cafes or conferences
 in sibar cafe ko na keval kisi agency main panjikaran karana hoga, balki unhen prayek upabhokta kaa vistrut log rakhana hoga, unhone kya kiya or kya unhone koi gaiyr-kanoonee kaam kiya
 How can the owner find out that what the wi-fi connection user is doing on his phone or laptop, he can be questioned about it
 kahani yaheen par khatm nahin hoti he
 All such cafes will have to submit logs with the agency
 neshnal uniwarsity of juridical sciensej, kolkata main kanoon ke professor shamanad bashir kaa kahana he, ''niyamon kaa paalan duswapn kii tarah hoga
 Legal norms are different from social norms
 agar log samajhte hai ki yah haasyaaspad he to ve uske anusaar nahin chalenge
 This is an example of bad policy and misuse of resources
 internet or wireles network ke chaalaaki se istemaal ko dekhte hue, yah pataa lagaana ekadam asambhav he ki kisne kya kiya
 It will be a little futile to find out its loss and profit now
 ''chintaa kaa ek anya bada vishay yah he ki koi bhi kisi saamagree ke bare main shikaayat kar saktaa he or is niyam kaa istemaal nijee pratishodh ke liye kar saktaa he
 Shubho Roy, president of the Internet and Mobile Association of India, says, "some of these rules are so absurd that they can cause chaos
" koi bhi jo asantusht hoga vah kisi bhi site se kuch bhi nikaal saktaa he-soshal netwarking site par bos kii ninda karnaa nindaatmak ho saktaa he, kisi mahila kii tarif karnaa ashleel mana ja saktaa he yaa kisi netaa kii aalochana ko apmanjanak kaha ja saktaa he
 "there is no provision for reconsideration or appeal, there is no system of seeking judicial permission before or after inspection
" nae niyamon main sabhi plateform, yahaan tak ki upabhokta kii saamagree ke liye search ingine bhi jimmedaar hoga
 Such objectionable material has to be removed within 36 hours of receiving the information
 raay kaa kahana he, ''yah niyam kisi bhi prabhavit paksh ko adhikaar detaa he ki adalati pachade main pade bina vah kisi bhi pratinidhi se aisi koi bhi saamagree hataane ke liye kahe jisase use chot pahunchi ho
 "bashir has raised another issue of how the government is wrongly looking at cyber security," put the entire responsibility on the technology that can interfere and benefit
 aapako chote bijness main or logon kii aazaadee main hastkshep karne kii jarurat nahin he
 The government needs to continuously develop software
 suraksha (sibar) kabhi bhi sthir mudda nahin rahegaa
 Take more measures to protect yourself
 vahi sabase badi raksha he
