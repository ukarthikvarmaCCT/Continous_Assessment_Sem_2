 Amidst all this, BJP President Amit Shah will meet Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai on Monday
 mana ja rahaa he ki is mulaakaat main shivasena or bijepi ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar sahmati ban sakati he
 In the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, the two parties together are preparing to enter the electoral arena once again
 shivasena centre kii modi or rajya kii fannavis sarkaar par kitne bhi hamale kare, lekin ab donon phir se ek saath milakar chunaav lard sakate hai
 If sources are to be believed, a formula has been agreed to contest half the seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 iske alaava loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 25 or shivasena ke 23 siton par chunaav ladane ko lekar baat bani he
 Explain that there are a total of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 26 siton par chunavi maidan main utari thi, jinamein se 23 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 While Shiv Sena contested 22 seats and won 18 seats
 vahiin, vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi or shivasena ne alag-alag chunaav lade the, lekin baad main donon ne milakar sarkaar banaaya tha
 After long workouts between BJP and Shiv Sena, both are now showing agreement
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah somvaar kii shaam ko shivasena pramukh se mulaakaat karne mumbai pahunch rahe hai
 It is believed that the BJP is ready to leave the Palghar Lok Sabha seat of the state
 loksabhaa ke saath-saath vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi siton kaa bantwaaraa lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa he
 However, the screw is still stuck on the post of Chief Minister
 shivasena siem pad apane paas chaahati he
 In the assembly elections, the seats of any party should be more, but the Chief Minister will belong to Shiv Sena
 jabaki bijepi ne shivasena ke saamne dhai-dhai saal kaa formula rakhaa he, lekin abhi ise lekar sanshay bana hua he
 BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should not be too keen on talks with Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif
 adwani ne kaha ki raksha mantri eke antni or sena pramukh bikram singh ne jab saaf taur par kah diya he ki elosi par paanch javaanon kii hatya main paak sena shaamil thi, aise main pradhanmantri ko navaj sharif se baatcheet ko lekar zyada utsukata nahin dikhaani chahie
 Advani, in his blog, praised the Army Chief for the fact that what the Army had said earlier in its press note was later referenced by the Defense Minister
 raksha mantri ne apane bayaan main kaha tha, 'pakistani sena kii special unit hamale main shaamil thi
 'advani wrote,' The country expects that the Prime Minister should abandon the eagerness for peace talks with his Pakistani counterpart after saying this in such clear words from the minister and the army

 co / nzqezxci4p It is said that friendship or enmity in Bollywood is not permanent
 vakt ke saath har cheez badalati rahati he or jarurat padane par har koi apana kaam nikaal letaa he, dost se bhi or dushman se bhi
 Now look at the latest example
 ham sab jaanate hai ki shahrukh khan or aamir khan ek-duusare ke bade pratidwandvi hai
 There is a lot of competition between the two, but still Aamir has no objection to promoting his film with Shah Rukh or in his film
 yaa phir yun kahen ki jaise hi aamir ko laga ki shahrukh kii film ke saath agar vah apni film ko jod denge to unki film kaa khub prachaar hoga, vaise hi aamir ne shahrukh kii film 'happy new year' ke saath apni film 'pike' kaa trailor jod diya
 Now the trailer of 'PK' will be run with 'happy New Year', which is released on the occasion of this Diwali
 iske liye film ke nirmaataaon ne khaastaur se multiplex maalikon se taai-ap kiya taaki 'happy new year' ke saath 'pike' kaa trailor chalaaya jaae
 Aamir Khan while talking on a promotional event said that Shah Rukh is a big star
 'happy new year' ek badi film he, jo diwali ke maukey par relies ho rahi he or unki film ko badi opening milti he
 In such a situation, running the trailer of 'PK' with 'happy New Year' will benefit my film, because more and more people will be watching it
 aamir ne yah bhi kaha kii aamtaur par pichley kuch saalon se shahrukh diwali ke maukey par film lekar aate hai or main christmas ke maukey par isliye ham donon kaa pramotion abhiyaan ek-duusare ke saamne aa hi jaataa he
 Not just Aamir
 ajay devgan bhi shahrukh kii film ke saath apni film ko pramot kar rahe he
 Has added the trailer of his film 'action Jackson' with 'happy New Year'
 haalanki shahrukh or ajay ke rishte bhi kuch khaas madhur nahin hai, magar mauka milte hi ajay ne bhi apni film ko shahrukh kii film ke saath jod diya
 With 'happy New Year', the trailer of 'action Jackson' will also play
 2 saal pehle jab diwali ke maukey par shahrukh kii film 'jab tak he jaan' ke saath ajay kii film 'san of sardaar' release hui thi, tab donon filmon ke bich screen share ko lekar takaraav kii baat ai thi, haalanki us vakt shahrukh ne saaf kaha tha ki unka ajay ke saath koi vivaad nahin he
 Shah Rukh kept saying that he is just the actor of the film, not the producer, so the controversy is with Yash Raj Baner, who produced the film 'jab Tak Hai Jaan', which was also true to some extent, but despite all these times - It was being said that Shahrukh and Ajay face to face
 film 'ection jackson' ke hero ajay ne kabool kiya or kaha ki shahrukh kii film ko badi opening milti he, aise main agar unki film kaa trailor 'happy new year' ke saath dikhaaya jayega to 'ection jackson' kii publicity main kaaphi phayda hoga
 whatever
 ham sab jaanate hai ki na hi shahrukh or aamir ke rishte madhur hai or na hi shahrukh or ajay ke bich koi dosti he
 But as soon as the need arises, there is no chance of coming together

 ahmedabad ke bujurg mata-pita ko us vakt baari aghat pahunchaa, jab ve apane sadhu bane bete ko lene pahunche or bete ne ghar waapas aane se inkaar kar diya
 In fact, his only son, Betadishant Patel, has been living a saintly life for the last three years at ISKON temple in Bhadj area of ahmedabad
 dishanth ke pita rameshbhai patel ore unki patni kii yahi ichha thi ki unka ejeeniyar betaa saamaajik jivan jie
 Dishant was very smart in studies and did his b
tech from Dhirubhai Ambani Institute in Gandhinagar, but immediately after taking a degree, he left his home and went to live in ISKONMANDIR
 pichley teen saal se uske maa-baap bete ke liye baar-baar isckon mandir ke chakkar kaat rahe hai, lekin unhen agar milane diya jaataa he to kuch minuton ke liye or logon kii maujuudagi main
 Ramesh Patel alleges that the people of ISKCON temple have brainwashed his son
 jab dishanth ke mata-pita isckon mandir pahunche to mandir kesaadhuone unhen kah diya ki dishanth police stesan gaya he
 Now he will talk in front of the police
 vahiin isckon mandir ke pravaktaa shyaam charan prabhu kaa kahana he ki hamaare mandir main hajaaron log aate he
 Some people want to serve more
 ve chote bachche nahin he ki unka brinwash kiya jaae
 When Dishant and his family were met in the presence of the police
 yahaan par pita baar-baar bete ke saamne haath jod kar ghar waapas chalane kii vinati karte rahe
 At the same time, his mother still hopes that his son will melt on seeing their tears and return home with them
 dishanth kaa kahana he ki vah ab mandir main hi rahanaa chahta he
 However, he avoided answering many questions
 dishanth ke mutabik, main mandir main hi seva karnaa chahta hu
 i have been devoted to the temple throughout Hoshohawas
 koi insaan agar sadhu kaa jivan jeena chahta he to use jeene dena chahie
 Now Dishant's father Rameshbhai says that the son is only showing his fundamental rights, but he does not see any duty towards his parents
 vahiin, police bhi is maamle main saaf maan rahi he ki dishanth balig he
 By law, no pressure can be given on it
 police inspector rana ke mutabik, mata-pita sadhu ban chuke dishanth ko ghar le janaa chaahate the, lekin uskaa kahana he ki usne sadhu kaa jivan grahan kar liya he
 At the same time, he has said to accept sage life on his own free will
 parivaar waalo ke paas ab koi kanoonee rasta yaa ummid nahin bachi he
 The family says that if someone decides to go to the temple against their family's will and become a monk, then the ISKCON temple should convince them

 Actually, i do not know why, in all the projects of purism, there is an irony that they make decisions on the whole world, just cannot see the inner ones
 apane sahi hone kaa ahankaar unako loktantric nahin rahane detaa
 Conversely, an extra sentimentality makes them somewhat cruel towards others
 tippaniyan This irony also seems to happen to Arvind Kejriwal
 afsos ye he ki is vidambnaa kaa faaydaa sabase zyaada wo centre sarkaar uthaa rahi he jo loktantric bahulata kii baat to bahut karti he, lekin na vah uski vichaardhaara main dikhaai padati he na uske netaaon kii baat main
 Otherwise, Jitendra Tomar, who is accused of giving false information about the degree, is also on the ministers of the central government and his cases are also in the courts
 magar yah darasal naitik mandandon kii ladaai nahin he, ek-duusare ko apni takat dikhaane kaa jhagada he or isamen andeh nahin ki philhal is jhagade main centre sarkaar rajya sarkaar par baari pad rahi he
 Unfortunately, this time people are also realizing that this is a battle of moral versus political, not political versus political in which there is a game of fake degrees on the one hand, on the other hand, to show their political power in the name of law
 satya kisi taraf nahin he, donon taraf satta he
 But why could not Kejriwal show this moral strength in the case of one of his ministers, who has encouraged all ministers and leaders of other parties to openly accuse the big industrialists of the country? Is it because their priorities too are determined by who is standing in support of them and who is opposing them? yah sawaal poochne kii tabiyat isliye hoti he ki aam aadmi party ne kuch hi din pehle naitikta ke sawaal par ek tikhi andruni ladaai ladi
 Those who thought it necessary to keep the party clean and to shore up the suspects were not only sidelined, but also humiliated and replaced by all those suspicious people who left many questions in their old occupation Were surrounded by darasal pataa nahin kyon, shuddhtavaad kii tamaam pariyojnaon main ek vidambnaa si yah hoti he ki ve sari duniya par faisale sunaati hai, bas apane bheetar ke andheron ko dekh nahin paatin
 The arrogance of their right does not allow them to remain democratic
 ulte ek atirikt bhavukta unako dusron ke prati kuch krur hi bana daalati he
 The comments arvind kejariwal ke saath bhi yah vidambnaa ghatit hoti najar aati he
 It is a matter of regret that the benefit of this irony is being taken up by most of the central government which talks a lot about democratic plurality, but it is not visible in its ideology nor in its leaders
 varanaa degree ko lekar galat jaankaree dene kaa jo aarope jitendra tomars par he, vah centre sarkaar ke mantriyon par bhi he or unke maamle bhi adaalaton main hai
 But this is not a fight for moral norms, it is a fight to show each other their strength and there is no doubt that at the moment the central government is overshadowing the state government
 durbhaagya ye he ki is baar log bhi mahasoos kar rahe hai ki yah naitik banaam rajnatik kii nahin, rajnatik banaam rajnatik kii ladaai he jisamen ek taraf farzi digriyon kaa khel he to duusari taraf kanoon ke naam par apni raajnneetik takat dikhaane kii chaalaaki
 Truth is not on any side, there is power on both sides

 Congress is directly attacking the government by linking it directly with the oppression of Dalits and depriving them of their rights

 Suspended officer of the Indian Police Service, Sanjeev Bhatt, said on Monday that his stand on the credibility of the Special Investigation Team probing the Gujarat riots case was also confirmed in the report of advocate Raju Ramachandran posted for the court's cooperation

 '' pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pok) ke ‘‘pradhanmantri’’ raja faruk haidar ne daawa kiya he ki vah jis safed helicopter main safar kar rahe the vah niyantran rekha ke ‘‘bahut kareeb’’ tha, lekinpakistanke hawaii kshetra ke bheetar hi tha, jisaki vajah se bhartiya adhikariyon ko is udaan kii jaankaree dene kii koi jarurat nahin thi or vah koi sainya helicopter nahin tha
 The Indian Army said on Sunday that a Pakistani helicopter breached Indian airspace near the Line of Control in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, but returned when it was confronted by guards stationed on the front
 bhartiya adhikariyon ne daawa kiya ki gulpur sector main bhartiya hawaii kshetra main safed helicopter ghus aayaa tha or waapas jane se pehle usne kuch der tak vahaan udaan bhari
 Seeing the violation of the airspace, sources said, three forward posts opened fire with small arms
 pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir ke netaa haidar ne kaha ki abbaspur gaanv ke paas jab ‘hamalaa’ kiya gaya, us vakt vah safed rang ke ek asainya helicopter main do mantriyon or apane nijee staff adhikari ke saath safar kar rahe the

 "hyder said," We were quite close to the zero line, but we were within our airspace
 iske alaava, yah ek asainya helicopter tha, isliye bhartiya thalsena ko is par goli nahin chalaani chahie thi
 He said that according to standard operating procedure, military helicopters from both sides inform each other before taking off, but it was a civilian helicopter, due to which there was no need to inform about it
 unhone kaha ki vah us ilaake main aksar aate-jate rahete hai, lekin aisi ghatana pehle kabhi nahin hui
 Hyder said that he would make the Government of Pakistan aware of the matter so that he would take up the issue and take appropriate action

 On Wednesday, police opened fire on a man in Minnesota, killing him
 iskaa video Facebook Live ke jariye post kiya gaya tha
 Although this video was removed shortly after, but Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has responded to it on Thursday
 unhone likhaa - main ummid karata hum ki minesota jaise videon hamen dobaaraa dekhne ko na milen
 However, such incidents also remind us why it is important to engage with an open mindset
 jakarbergane apni post main us parivaar ke prati apana dukh vyakt karte hue likhaa ki is mushkil ghadi main vah unke saath hai or aisi hi ghatnaon kii shikaar hue anya pariwaron ke prati bhi samvednaa prakat karte hai
 Not only this, he also expressed condolences to the members of Facebook whose feelings have been hurt by posting such videos
 dekhen jakarberg kii post :kya he maamlabudhvaar cofacebukapar post kiye gaye is video main ek ashwet mahila or purush najar aa rahe the
 The man's shirt was covered in blood
 mahila, jiskaa naam diamond renolds he, ek camere main dekhakar bol rahi thi ki uske bwoyfriend ko police ne bevajaah goli maar di he
 He was ejected due to the foot light of the car
 is dauraan uske bwoyfriend, Philando Castile, ne police ko bataaya ki uske paas license vaali pistal he jis par use goli maar di gai
 Significantly, this is the second incident of police shooting in the US within 24 hours
 isse pehle 37 saal ke ashwet Alton Sterling par bhi police ne ek store ke baahar goliyaan barasaai thim
 He was also killed in the incident

 vahiin, rashtriya lok samta party ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha or lok janashakti party ramvilas paswan ke baad nitish kumaar kii janata dal united (jediu) ne ravivaar ko ek baithak ke baad kaha ki loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha kaa chunaav bihar main nitish kumaar ke netritv or cheharaa par ladaa janaa chahie
 Some leaders of Janata United from Bihar have also started making statements in view of the 2019 elections
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa maananaa he ki janata dal ke netaaon kaa vaktavy bhaajapa se zyaada janata dal united ke netaa or kaaryakartaaon ko sandesh bhejne kii qavaayad he ki filhal wo narendra modi ke saamne puri tarah natmastak nahin hue hai
 But now on June 7, the leaders of the NDA, including the mlas of all the parties, will have their eyes fixed on who says what
 bihar se bhi janata united ke kuch netaaon se abhi se 2019 chunaav ke maddenjar bayaan dena aarambh kar diya he
 BJP leaders believe that the statement of Janata Dal leaders is more than sending a message to the leaders and workers of Janata Dal United that they have not completely bowed down to Narendra Modi

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who addressed the country from Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day, said that the celebration of this Independence Day is also special for the country because India has become the 6th largest economy in the world
 piem ne kaha ki aaj puri duniya kii najar bhartiya arthvyavastha par tiki he
 The PM said that the experts of the global economy have also claimed that the Indian economy has risen in the last few years
 iske chalate aane vaale teen dashakon tak vaishvik arthvyavastha ko apane sahare daudane ke liye bharat taiyaar ho chukaa he
 Prime Minister Modi claimed that his government has succeeded in increasing India's threat to the whole world
 iskaa shrey modi ne desh ke sava sau karod sapane, sankalp or purusharth ko diya jisane sahi disha main chalakar is kirtiman ko sthapit kiya he
 Read this: 3 lakh fake companies closed, 6 crore beneficiaries fake, but silence on black money Prime Minister Modi claimed that at present the eyes of the global economy are focused on India
 choti-badi chizon ke liye bade se bade or chote se chote desh bharat kii taraf dekh rahe hai
 PM Modi said that till his tenure, it was claimed for the Indian economy on the global stage that it contained huge risks
 lekin maujuuda samay main vahi vaishvik manch is baat ko maan rahaa he ki bharat main aarthik sudhaar kii kavayad ke chalate arthvyavastha main moolbhoot parivartan dekhne ko mila he or iske chalate vaishvik niveshkon kii najar bharat par tiki he
 The Prime Minister claimed that while red tape was mentioned for India before his tenure, India is now known for Ease of Doing Business with the efforts of his government and the beginning of economic reforms
 piem ne kaha ki jahaan pehle bhartiya arthvyavastha ko frejail five main rakhaa jaataa tha vahiin ab bharat ko multi-billian dollar investment ke thikaane ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The PM said that this has been possible only because of his policy of reform, performance and transform
 ise padhein: piem ne bataai apane kaam kii raftaar, lekin sachai thodi alabehaal hi main antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke bayaan ki bhartiya arthvyavastha kaa hathi ab uth khadaa hua he or daudane ke liye taiyaar he par piem modi ne kaha ki bharat ke liye yah samay behad khaas he kyonki in aarthik sudhaaron ke sahare ab vaishvik arthvyavastha main do-teen dashakon ke liye bharat netritv ke liye taiyaar ho chukaa he
 Prime Minister Modi said that the global organizations in which India could not think of membership, she is accepting India's leadership today
 piem ne kaha ki paryaavaran, global warming, maanavadhikaar ityadi ke kshetra main bharat kii bhoomika behad ahm ho chuki he
 The PM said that this can also be gauged from the fact that today if any Indian shows a passport at any airport in the world, it is welcomed with respect

 grih vibhaag ne mumbai main hue silsilewar visphoton ko aatankwaadi hamalaa bataaya he
 The accused in the December 16 gang rape scandal in Delhi bludgeoned him during the rape
 abhiyojan paksh ke ek gavaah ne fast trek court main yah khulaasa kiya
 The witness-forensic dentist said that the 23-year-old victim's teeth on her body are similar to those of the accused - Ram Singh and perhaps Akshay's tooth model
 is gavaah ne atirikt satr nyaayadhish yogesh khanna kii adaalat main bachaav paksh ke vakil dwaara jirah ke dauraan kaha, ‘pehali, duusari or chauthi tasviir dikhne vaale daant kaantane ke nishaan or paanch sandigdhon ke daant ke model ke saath tulana ke aadhaar par chikitsa kii drushti se yah taarkik parinti he ki ram singh ke daant se ye nishaan bane hai
 This comparison is not true with respect to the other four suspects
 ’unhone kaha, ‘paanchavi tasviir main daant kaatane ke nishaan tathaa paanch sandigdhon ke daant ke model ke saath tulana ke aadhaar par is baat kii prabal sambhaavna banati he ki akshay ne ye nishaan use die
 This comparison is not true with respect to the remaining four suspects
 ’is par jab bachaav paksh ke vakil ve ke anand ne gavaah se kaha ki unki report main ‘sambhaavna’, ‘shaayad’ jaise shabd darshaate hai ki yah bharosemand, thos nahin hai or is par baat aage nahin bad sakati he
 The witnesses then began to tell them about the various degrees of certainty and that they are used when these reports are prepared
 unhone unhen yah bhi bataaya ki har str kaa kya matlab hota he
 During the court proceedings, the atmosphere got heated when the prosecution led by Special Public Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan and Additional Public Prosecutor Rajeev Mohan objected to the question of AP Singh, counsel for accused Vinay Sharma
 e pi singh ne jaananaa chaha ki doctor ko apni report taiyaar karne se pehle kya yah pataa tha ki peedita paramedical chaatra thi
 The prosecution objected to such inquiries
 lekin jab gavaah ne kaha ki vah akhabaaron kii khabaron ke anusaar aage nahin badhate tab maahaul halkaa ho gaya
 The forensic dentist also said, 'it would be wrong to say that my report is not based on a correct conclusion
 yah bhi kahana galat hoga ki maine dilli police ke ishaare par or abhiyojan paksh ko laabh pahunchane ke liye apni report taiyaar kii he kyonki peedita para medical chaatra thi
 He also denied the allegation of the counsel for the accused that he was not competent to make such forensic reports
 unhone kaha, ‘maine aisa koi niyam yaa vinium nahin dekha ki danta vigyaan snaatak (bidies) aisi report de saktaa he yaa nahin de saktaa
 It is a practice that BDS can give such a report
 ’ ullekhneey he ki 16 disambar ko paramedical kii is chaatra ke saath nrushans samuhik balaatkaar kiya gaya tha

 ravivaar ko bhopal pahunchane ke baad se hi madhya pradesh police lagaataar unpar najar banaae hue he
 Let us tell you that in the recently held Lok Sabha elections, Baba claimed the victory of Congress candidate Digvijaya Singh (digvijaya Singh) from Bhopal seat and announced to take water samadhi in the absence of it

 baba aaj dopaher 2
 They could not reach the pond to take water samadhi at the scheduled time of 11 o'clock because the police did not let them leave the hotel
 police ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki baba ko jal samadhi lene nahin diya ja saktaa or isaki anumati bhi nahin di jaayegi kyonki is prakaar kii anumati dene kaa koi praavdhaan hi nahin he

 ek seshan main prasoon ne deshbhakti se lekar cinema main aate badlaavon tak tamaam muddon par baat kii
 During this, Prasoon also objected to the way women were shown in cinema
 unhone kaha ki kuch drishyon ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki mahila mahaj maance kaa tukdaa ban kar rah gai he
 Prasoon said, "when the lady is showing the police officer, many times you are only zooming the camera at a few places
 us mahila ne us pad tak pahunchane ke liye kitni mehnat kii hogi
 There are so many things that need to be expressed, but looking at it in the cinema, it seems that the girl has become a mere piece of meat
 aap use ek maance ke tukade ke taur par hi dekhte hai

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The incident that brought shame on the sacred relationship of husband and wife from Rajasthan has come to light
 rajasthan se jhunjhanu main karj main duube ek pati ne karj na chukaa paane par apni patni ko karj dene waalon ko saunp diya
 The lender raped his wife for several days in front of her husband
 peedita kii shikaayat par police ne uske pati, sasuraal waalon sahit aadha darjan logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he
 According to the information, the shocking incident took place on August 7, 2016

 The husband told his wife that he had taken a lot of debt from Khadim and in the event of not repaying the loan, he had made a deal with his wife with Khadim
 iske baad khaadim naam ke us vyakti ne us raat pati ke saamne hi peedita ke saath dushkarm kiya
 After this, the process of rape with the victim continued throughout the week
 is dauraan khaadim ke alaava nasrin, abbaas, saleem or samim naam ke vyaktiyon ne bhi uske saath dushkarm kiya
 When the victim told her in-laws about the painful incident she was having with them, they in turn instructed her to keep her mouth shut
 itnaa hi nahin sasuraal waalon ne usase kaha ki agar vah apane maayke se 10 lakh rupee lekar aae to use baksh diya jayega

 Rahul Gandhi has not targeted the Modi government, the country could not emerge from the injury because of the ban - Modi's former president Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government fiercely on Saturday
 arthvyavastha, berogari, kanoon vyavastha sahit tamaam muddon ko lekar rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko aade haath liya
 At the Congress's 'bharat Bachao Rally' held at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, Rahul Gandhi said that the future of the world was China and India and today they are holding onions
 hindustan kii arthvyavastha modi ne swayan akele nasht kar di
 You will remember that at 8 o'clock in the night i came on TV and said brothers and sisters 500 and 1000 notes, i am going to stop
 isse iconomi ko jo chot pahunchi, vah aaj tak thik nahin hui
 LIVE: Congress Save India rally
 
 
 padhe har taaja apadetcongress netaa ne kaha ki narendra modi ne aapse jhooth kaha ki kaledhan se ladaai he, bhrashtachar ko khatm karnaa he
 Told a lie maataaon-bahanon aapaki jeb se paise nikaalkar bade udyogpatiyon ke hawaale kar die gaye
 Referring to GST, Rahul Gandhi said that Manmohan Singh and p Chidambaram said that GST should not be implemented without AAP (modi government) pilot project
 lekin unhone kaha nahin
 The Modi government imposed the Gabbar Singh Tax at 12 pm
 jo jidipi growth 9 percent hoti thi vah aaj 4 percent ho gai he
 If you measure in the old way 2
 5 percent bhi nahin hogi
 The Congress leader said that all the enemies of India wanted the economy of India to be destroyed
 wo dushmano ne nahin kiya balki wo kaam hamaare pradhanmantri ne kiya or phir apane aap ko deshbhakt kehete hai
 Two to three industrialists have caught all the money
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki is desh main bahut saare eemaandaar udyogpati hai
 If this country makes farmers, small shopkeepers make honest industrialists
 pichley 5 saalon main narendra modi ne adani ko 50 contract die hai
 Over one lakh crore rupees
 desh ke airport pakadaa die
 Gave up without a contract
 kyon diya
 What would you call it? isko aap chori nahin kahenge bhrashtachar nahin kahenge to kya kahenge
 Earlier, when Rahul Gandhi reached the stage, he addressed the workers present there as Babbar Sher and Sherni
 unhone kaha ki meraa naam rahul saavarkar nahin he
 My name is Rahul Gandhi
 main sachai bolne ke liye kabhi maafee nahin maagunga
 Neither any congressman will ask
 maafee narendra modi ko desh se maangani he, unke assistant amit shah ko desh se maafee maangani he
 In Nagaon, Assam, there was an incident that shocked everyone

 After all, why are the teachers of Delhi University appearing again in rebellious attitude? After the long battle of FYUP, is this fight going to be long? aisa kyon hota he ki jab shikshak sangharsh par utarate hai to samaaj munh mode letaa he
 Is it because the teachers themselves or the society does not know what is the work of teachers? pichley kuch hafton main dilli vishvavidhyalay main saajha morcha bana hua he
 Teacher organizations from BJP to Congress and Left Front have united against a gazette notification of UGC
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki agar yah adhisuchana waapas nahin hui to is haal main jo saikadon kii bheed dikh rahi he or haal ke baahar is march main jo sankhya dikh rahi he, wo shaayad naukari se hi baahar ho jaae
 The UGC order has frightened teachers from left to right
 ek anumaan ke anusaar lagbhag paanch hazaar edock yani tadarth shikshakon kii naukari ja sakati he
 Will any government risk cutting such a large number of jobs
 doosraa sawaal he sthaayee shikshakon kaa kaarybhaar badha diya he
 Permanent teachers say that by increasing their work, they cannot do justice with the teaching work, rather it is not possible to do it
 sansaadhan or suvidhaon ko dekhte hue ye mumkin nahin he
 No one is listening to them, so today, teachers of Delhi Universities staged a sit-in with a plate
 meri awaz suno tip
 Everyone complains that no one is listening to us
 yah is baat kaa pramaan he ki sunne vaali sansthaaen aasaani se nahin sunati yaa phir sunati hi nahin
 When you and i hear that an assistant professor is being asked to teach 24 hours a week and he would like to, we might not have any sympathy for this
 kya ham jaanate hai ki 24 ghanta padhaane kaa kya matlab he
 How much energy is required to speak an hour, how much preparation is required
 mujhe ek ghante ke 'prime time' ke liye rozaana saat se aath ghante kii padhai padhani padati he or ek ghante ke sho ke baad kisi kaam laayak nahin bachataa
 What are the three classes a teacher can take in a day of one hour
 lagaataar bolnaa, bolte hue nae nae tathyon ko zahan main rakhana or chaatro se behatar samvaad bananaa
 Sushil Mahapatra asked some students what do you think the teacher does
 shikshakon ko khush hona chahie ki chaatraon ko pataa he ki unki mehnat kya he
 But there is also a fact that there is a severe shortage of teachers who do not teach in all universities
 agar saare hi shikshak nahin padhaate hai to phir vishvavidhyalay chalate kaise hai
 Then there would be no work from Vice Chancellor to Principal
 wo ek tasviir he magar puri tasviir nahin he
 In the last few weeks i did prime time on the judges' problem
 police ke javaanon ke chaudaa-chaudaa ghante kaam karne ko lekar prime time or doctoron kii kami ko lekar bhi
 Today it is the turn of teachers
 hamane ek shikshak se baat kii unhen ek lacture ke liye kitna kaam karnaa padataa he
 Currently, a DU teacher said that he had to teach 14 to 16 hours a week
 ho saktaa he ki rose aath ghante kaam karne vaale hafte main 14 se 16 ghante kii baat sunakar shikshakon kii baat na samaj paae
 The DU teacher told me that teaching what we call lecture is a intensive activity
 aap ek ghante tak lagaataar bolte hai, bolne ke liye sochate hai or sochate-sochate yah dhyaan main rakhte hai ki chaatro ko baat samaj main ai yaa nahin
 You do not have time to stop and think ten minutes in class
 padhaane ke liye har din ghar par yaa librari main teen se chaar ghante lagaataar padhanaa padataa he
 Preparation for teaching takes an average of fifteen hours each week
 ab aaiye asinament par
 Think of the assignment as a kind of homework
 ek shikshak ko ek maheene main 120 asinament check karne hote hai
 An assignment is six to fifteen pages
 jinaki jaanch main hafte kaa das ghanta chalaa jaataa he
 It is five to ten pages long
 agar class main chaatro kii sankhya zyaada he to asinament kii sankhya bhi zyaada ho sakati he
 Therefore, if you look at the work of teachers with just three classes, it will not be right
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhiye ki shikshak ek tarah se chaatro kaa kol centre bhi hota he
 Participates in issues ranging from personal problems to social problems
 usamen jo samay jaataa he uskaa koi hisaab kitaab nahin he
 Many teachers write recommendations for students
 raaton ko jaag jaag kar taaki chaatr ko videshon main kisi achche vishvavidhyalay main daakhila mil jaae yaa chaatravrutti mil jaae
 It takes teachers hours to write such a letter
 is kaam kaa hisaab ujisi se lekar samaaj kii kisi smriti pustika main darj nahin hota he
 i have not even told you about uploading the data of the attendance register and exam numbers and checking the copy
 aap bhi dukhi ho jaaenge or kabhi na teacher banane kii kasam kha sakate hai
 This is just the account of teaching
 prashasnic kaaryon kaa hisaab maine nahin diya he kyonki tivi main har baarik jaankaree dena mushkil ho jaataa he
 The UGC and the university also expect that every teacher after doing so much work should do equally well in research
 isse ye hua he ki jo teacher sirf behatar teaching karnaa chaahate hai, unhen kamatar bana diya gaya he, matlab padhaanaa tabhi padhaanaa mana jayega jab aap research karen
 But after so much work throughout the day, you wonder which library will go to do research
 nayaa parchaa likhane ke liye kahaan jayega
 In a university like DU, teachers do not even have their own rooms
 kabhi ek saath sabhi shikshak college aa jaaen to staff rup main unke baithne ke liye kursiyaan tak nahin hoti hai
 This is the condition of the university where no one gets admission at less than 95 per cent, but in spite of that the credibility of the same university is such that people come to DU with 98 per cent
 to yah saakh kaise bani hogi
 What would not have happened by teaching? to phir shikshak kin baton ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Because UGC wants teachers to teach more
 ek assistant professor ko hafte main 16 ghante kii jagah 18 ghante padhaanaa hoga
 Six hours of separate tutorials have to be given
 associat professor ko 14 ghante kii jagah ab 16 ghante padhaane honge or tutorils ke liye 6 ghante dene honge
 The professor will have 14 hours of teaching and 6 hours of tutorials
 ujisi ne in sab gatividhiyon ko pehle Direct Teaching Hours main shaamil kiya tha, magar ab isaki paribhaasha badal kar isamen se tutorils ko baahar kar diya gaya he matlab tutorial ko shikshan nahin mana jayega
 And universities are not known, but there is a system in DU where the teacher takes separate classes with small groups of students where they talk about the main lecture whether they understood it or not
 yah class bhi ek tarah se lacture jaisaa ho jaataa he
 Now i have understood that UGC has said that in these 6 hours, you will have to take tutorials, seminars, administrative work, innovation and update the content of the course
 kyon karnaa hoga isaki koi vajah nahin bataai gai he
 We will talk about what will happen with this, but that is why it is being said
 sthaayee shikshakon kaa kaary bhaar badha dene se vishvavidlaayon main nai naukariyon kii sambhaavnaaen kam ho jaaengi
 This will not give jobs to young teachers and will leave the job of teachers teaching temporarily for many years
 keval dilli vishvividhyalay main paanch hazaar asthaayee shikshakon kii naukari ja sakati he
 In the rest of the universities of the country, the post of teachers will continue to decrease
 nai naukariyaan nahin hongi
 Now you will ask what will be the difference if the job is reduced
 bilkul sahi sawaal he
 Do not just say this to a young person who is looking for the dream of teaching for the country by doing phd or M
 Phil
 phir ham yah bhi chaahate hai ki hamaare vishvavidhyalay duniya ke nami vishvavidhyalay ke jaise kyon nahin ban sakate
 This is your right bilkul ban sakate hai lekin hamen ye dekhnaa hoga ki wo kyon hai
 Right now i am not entering into a private university and government university debate
 wo alag masalaa he
 a teacher at Harvard University has a load of 7 students
 oxford vishvavidhyalay main ek shikshak par 11 chaatro kaa bhaar he
 a teacher at the London School of Economics has a burden of 12 students
 dilli vishvavidlaay main ek shikshak par 20 chaatr hai
 Teachers Association says that UGC notification will increase the burden of students on every teacher and it will not be possible for them to take care of all students
 duniya ke namchin vishvavidhyalayon main ek teacher ko hafte main chah ghante hi padhaane hote hai
 On the one hand we are dreaming of universities of the world, on the other hand we are also making rules against their standards
 iske virodh main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke shikshak sangh 24 may se 1 lakh tees hazaar chaatro kii copy nahin jaanch rahe hai
 In addition to going to thousands of jobs, he says that the increase in teaching hours will make it difficult to focus on research and administrative responsibilities
 jis API (academic Performance Indicators) torget par shikshakon kaa pramotion tay hota he, khaastaur par assistant professor kaa, usase unka pramotion mushkil ho jayega
 The comments asthaayee shikshakon kii bahut durgati he
 In addition to teaching from them, if i start counting the kind of work done in colleges, then your evening will be spoiled
 aapkaa mood thik rahe isliye thodaa sa bataae detaa hum
 Have to stay in a yoga class once or twice a month
 iske liye ghar se paanch baje nikalnaa hota he kyonki yoga class saadhe chah baje hoti he
 If the teaching class is from twelve o'clock, you have to wait for five hours in the college
 centre or rajya sarkaar ke diwason main shaamil hona padataa he,jaise svachh bharat abhiyaan,good garvanence
 These days range from depositing students to distributing lunch coupons
 har tisare chauthe din par vibhageeya baithak hoti he, kai baar meeting class ke samay ho jaati he
 Principal resentment if he did not leave class and went to meeting, student resentment if he did not go to class
 college ke sarkari kaaryon kaa data bananaa, aplod karnaa ye sab bhi kaam he
 In college parties, temporary teachers are present as security
 asthaayee shikshako ko is tarah ke kai kaary karne hote hai padhaane ke alaava
 DU has close to five thousand temporary teachers
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 This means that so many teachers are needed, so why not a job
 kya aap yaa ham jaanate hai ki sabhi vishvavidlaayon main kitni naukariyaan har saal nikalati hai
 How many posts remain temporary and are not filled permanently
 july 2014 main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki 39 kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main 16,692 pad manzur hai jinamein se 6251 pad khaali hai
 This was the number of empty
 jo pad khaali nahin the un par sthaayee niyukti thi yaa asthaayee ye jaananaa dilachasp hota
 For example, in DU itself, the number of temporary teachers is said to be 5000 thousand
 desh ke tamaam rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon ke aankade aa jate to sahi se pataa chalata ki kitne pad manzur hai or kitne padon par asthaayee taur par niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai
 When you and i hear that an assistant professor is being asked to teach 24 hours a week and he would like to, we might not have any sympathy for this
 kya ham jaanate hai ki 24 ghanta padhaane kaa kya matlab he
 How much energy is required to speak an hour, how much preparation is required
 mujhe ek ghante ke 'prime time' ke liye rozaana saat se aath ghante kii padhai padhani padati he or ek ghante ke sho ke baad kisi kaam laayak nahin bachataa
 What are the three classes a teacher can take in a day of one hour
 lagaataar bolnaa, bolte hue nae nae tathyon ko zahan main rakhana or chaatro se behatar samvaad bananaa
 Sushil Mahapatra asked some students what do you think the teacher does
 shikshakon ko khush hona chahie ki chaatraon ko pataa he ki unki mehnat kya he
 But there is also a fact that there is a severe shortage of teachers who do not teach in all universities
 agar saare hi shikshak nahin padhaate hai to phir vishvavidhyalay chalate kaise hai
 Then there would be no work from Vice Chancellor to Principal
 wo ek tasviir he magar puri tasviir nahin he
 In the last few weeks i did prime time on the judges' problem
 police ke javaanon ke chaudaa-chaudaa ghante kaam karne ko lekar prime time or doctoron kii kami ko lekar bhi
 Today it is the turn of teachers
 hamane ek shikshak se baat kii unhen ek lacture ke liye kitna kaam karnaa padataa he
 Currently, a DU teacher said that he had to teach 14 to 16 hours a week
 ho saktaa he ki rose aath ghante kaam karne vaale hafte main 14 se 16 ghante kii baat sunakar shikshakon kii baat na samaj paae
 The DU teacher told me that teaching what we call lecture is a intensive activity
 aap ek ghante tak lagaataar bolte hai, bolne ke liye sochate hai or sochate-sochate yah dhyaan main rakhte hai ki chaatro ko baat samaj main ai yaa nahin
 You do not have time to stop and think ten minutes in class
 padhaane ke liye har din ghar par yaa librari main teen se chaar ghante lagaataar padhanaa padataa he
 Preparation for teaching takes an average of fifteen hours each week
 ab aaiye asinament par
 Think of the assignment as a kind of homework
 ek shikshak ko ek maheene main 120 asinament check karne hote hai
 An assignment is six to fifteen pages
 jinaki jaanch main hafte kaa das ghanta chalaa jaataa he
 It is five to ten pages long
 agar class main chaatro kii sankhya zyaada he to asinament kii sankhya bhi zyaada ho sakati he
 Therefore, if you look at the work of teachers with just three classes, it will not be right
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhiye ki shikshak ek tarah se chaatro kaa kol centre bhi hota he
 Participates in issues ranging from personal problems to social problems
 usamen jo samay jaataa he uskaa koi hisaab kitaab nahin he
 Many teachers write recommendations for students
 raaton ko jaag jaag kar taaki chaatr ko videshon main kisi achche vishvavidhyalay main daakhila mil jaae yaa chaatravrutti mil jaae
 It takes teachers hours to write such a letter
 is kaam kaa hisaab ujisi se lekar samaaj kii kisi smriti pustika main darj nahin hota he
 i have not even told you about uploading the data of the attendance register and exam numbers and checking the copy
 aap bhi dukhi ho jaaenge or kabhi na teacher banane kii kasam kha sakate hai
 This is just the account of teaching
 prashasnic kaaryon kaa hisaab maine nahin diya he kyonki tivi main har baarik jaankaree dena mushkil ho jaataa he
 The UGC and the university also expect that every teacher after doing so much work should do equally well in research
 isse ye hua he ki jo teacher sirf behatar teaching karnaa chaahate hai, unhen kamatar bana diya gaya he, matlab padhaanaa tabhi padhaanaa mana jayega jab aap research karen
 But after so much work throughout the day, you wonder which library will go to do research
 nayaa parchaa likhane ke liye kahaan jayega
 In a university like DU, teachers do not even have their own rooms
 kabhi ek saath sabhi shikshak college aa jaaen to staff rup main unke baithne ke liye kursiyaan tak nahin hoti hai
 This is the condition of the university where no one gets admission at less than 95 per cent, but in spite of that the credibility of the same university is such that people come to DU with 98 per cent
 to yah saakh kaise bani hogi
 What would not have happened by teaching? to phir shikshak kin baton ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Because UGC wants teachers to teach more
 ek assistant professor ko hafte main 16 ghante kii jagah 18 ghante padhaanaa hoga
 Six hours of separate tutorials have to be given
 associat professor ko 14 ghante kii jagah ab 16 ghante padhaane honge or tutorils ke liye 6 ghante dene honge
 The professor will have 14 hours of teaching and 6 hours of tutorials
 ujisi ne in sab gatividhiyon ko pehle Direct Teaching Hours main shaamil kiya tha, magar ab isaki paribhaasha badal kar isamen se tutorils ko baahar kar diya gaya he matlab tutorial ko shikshan nahin mana jayega
 And universities are not known, but there is a system in DU where the teacher takes separate classes with small groups of students where they talk about the main lecture whether they understood it or not
 yah class bhi ek tarah se lacture jaisaa ho jaataa he
 Now i have understood that UGC has said that in these 6 hours, you will have to take tutorials, seminars, administrative work, innovation and update the content of the course
 kyon karnaa hoga isaki koi vajah nahin bataai gai he
 We will talk about what will happen with this, but that is why it is being said
 sthaayee shikshakon kaa kaary bhaar badha dene se vishvavidlaayon main nai naukariyon kii sambhaavnaaen kam ho jaaengi
 This will not give jobs to young teachers and will leave the job of teachers teaching temporarily for many years
 keval dilli vishvividhyalay main paanch hazaar asthaayee shikshakon kii naukari ja sakati he
 In the rest of the universities of the country, the post of teachers will continue to decrease
 nai naukariyaan nahin hongi
 Now you will ask what will be the difference if the job is reduced
 bilkul sahi sawaal he
 Do not just say this to a young person who is looking for the dream of teaching for the country by doing phd or M
 Phil
 phir ham yah bhi chaahate hai ki hamaare vishvavidhyalay duniya ke nami vishvavidhyalay ke jaise kyon nahin ban sakate
 This is your right bilkul ban sakate hai lekin hamen ye dekhnaa hoga ki wo kyon hai
 Right now i am not entering into a private university and government university debate
 wo alag masalaa he
 a teacher at Harvard University has a load of 7 students
 oxford vishvavidhyalay main ek shikshak par 11 chaatro kaa bhaar he
 a teacher at the London School of Economics has a burden of 12 students
 dilli vishvavidlaay main ek shikshak par 20 chaatr hai
 Teachers Association says that UGC notification will increase the burden of students on every teacher and it will not be possible for them to take care of all students
 duniya ke namchin vishvavidhyalayon main ek teacher ko hafte main chah ghante hi padhaane hote hai
 On the one hand we are dreaming of universities of the world, on the other hand we are also making rules against their standards
 iske virodh main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke shikshak sangh 24 may se 1 lakh tees hazaar chaatro kii copy nahin jaanch rahe hai
 In addition to going to thousands of jobs, he says that the increase in teaching hours will make it difficult to focus on research and administrative responsibilities
 jis API (academic Performance Indicators) torget par shikshakon kaa pramotion tay hota he, khaastaur par assistant professor kaa, usase unka pramotion mushkil ho jayega
 The comments asthaayee shikshakon kii bahut durgati he
 In addition to teaching from them, if i start counting the kind of work done in colleges, then your evening will be spoiled
 aapkaa mood thik rahe isliye thodaa sa bataae detaa hum
 Have to stay in a yoga class once or twice a month
 iske liye ghar se paanch baje nikalnaa hota he kyonki yoga class saadhe chah baje hoti he
 If the teaching class is from twelve o'clock, you have to wait for five hours in the college
 centre or rajya sarkaar ke diwason main shaamil hona padataa he,jaise svachh bharat abhiyaan,good garvanence
 These days range from depositing students to distributing lunch coupons
 har tisare chauthe din par vibhageeya baithak hoti he, kai baar meeting class ke samay ho jaati he
 Principal resentment if he did not leave class and went to meeting, student resentment if he did not go to class
 college ke sarkari kaaryon kaa data bananaa, aplod karnaa ye sab bhi kaam he
 In college parties, temporary teachers are present as security
 asthaayee shikshako ko is tarah ke kai kaary karne hote hai padhaane ke alaava
 DU has close to five thousand temporary teachers
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 This means that so many teachers are needed, so why not a job
 kya aap yaa ham jaanate hai ki sabhi vishvavidlaayon main kitni naukariyaan har saal nikalati hai
 How many posts remain temporary and are not filled permanently
 july 2014 main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki 39 kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main 16,692 pad manzur hai jinamein se 6251 pad khaali hai
 This was the number of empty
 jo pad khaali nahin the un par sthaayee niyukti thi yaa asthaayee ye jaananaa dilachasp hota
 For example, in DU itself, the number of temporary teachers is said to be 5000 thousand
 desh ke tamaam rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon ke aankade aa jate to sahi se pataa chalata ki kitne pad manzur hai or kitne padon par asthaayee taur par niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai
 Sushil Mahapatra asked some students what do you think the teacher does
 shikshakon ko khush hona chahie ki chaatraon ko pataa he ki unki mehnat kya he

 Now let's come to the assignment
 asinament ko ek kism kaa homework samajhiye
 a teacher has to do 120 assignment checks in a month
 ek asinament chah se pandrah pannon kaa hota he
 In whose investigation ten hours of the week goes
 paanch se das panne kaa hota he
 If the number of students in the class is more, then the number of assignments can also be more
 isliye agar aap shikshakon ke kaam ko sirf teen class kii sankhya se dekhenge to sahi nahin hoga
 Also keep in mind that teacher is also a kind of call center for students
 vyaktigat samasyaon se lekar saamaajik samasyaon main bhi hissedaar ho jaataa he
 There is no account of the time that goes into it
 kai shikshak chaatro ke liye recomendation likhte hai
 Wake up nights so that the student gets admission in a good university abroad or gets a scholarship
 aise ek patr likhane main shikshakon ke kai ghante chale jate hai
 The account of this work is not recorded in any memorial book from UGC to the society
 atendence register or pariksha ke numberon kaa data aplod karnaa or copy check karne kaa kaam to maine abhi bataaya bhi nahin
 You too will be sad and can vow never to become a teacher
 ye sirf padhaane kaa hisaab he
 i have not given account of administrative work because it becomes difficult to give every fine information in TV
 ujisi or vishvavidhyalay ummid bhi karata he ki har shikshak itnaa kaam karne ke baad research main bhi utana hi behatar kare
 It has happened that teachers who want to do only better teaching have been made less, meaning teaching will be considered only when you do research
 lekin din bhar ke itane kaam ke baad aap sochiye ki research karne ke liye kis librari main jayega
 Where will i go to write a new form? diu jaise vishvividhyalay main shikshakon ke paas apane kamare tak nahin hote
 Sometimes when all the teachers come to the college together, they do not even have chairs to sit in the staff form
 ye us vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he jahaan kisi ko 95 fisadi se kam par admician nahin miltaa lekin iske baavjood usee vishvavidhyalay kii itani saakh to he ki log 98 pratishat lekar diu hi aate hai
 So how would this credibility be created
 kya nahin padhaakar bani hogi
 Then what are the teachers demonstrating about kyonki ujisi chaahati he ki shikshak or zyaada padhaaen
 An assistant professor will have to teach 18 hours a week instead of 16 hours
 alag se chah ghante tutorils ke liye dene honge
 The associate professor will now have to teach 16 hours instead of 14 hours and 6 hours for tutorials
 professor ko 14 ghante padhaane ke or 6 ghante tutorils ke dene honge
 The UGC had previously included all these activities in the Direct Teaching Hours, but now its definition has been changed and the tutorials have been excluded from it, meaning the tutorial will not be considered as teaching
 or vishvavidhyalayon kaa to pataa nahin, lekin diu main ye vyavastha he jisamen teacher chaatro ke chote-chote samoohon ke saath alag se class letaa he jahaan unke saath main lacture ko lekar baat hoti he ki unhen samaj ai yaa nahin
 This class also becomes like a lecture
 jinata main samaj sakaa hum ab ujisi ne kaha he ki in 6 ghanton main tutorils bhi lene honge, seminar bhi karne karaane honge, prashasnic kaam bhi karnaa hoga, innovations bhi karnaa hoga or course ke content ko apadet bhi karnaa hoga
 No reason has been given as to why
 isse kya hoga, ham baat karenge lekin isi kaaran yah kaha ja rahaa he
 Increasing the workload of permanent teachers will reduce the chances of new jobs in universities
 isse yuva shikshakon ko naukari nahin milegi or kai varshon se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe shikshakon kii naukari chali jaaegi
 Only five thousand temporary teachers can be employed in Delhi University
 desh ke baaki vishvavidlaayon main shikshakon kaa pad kam hota chalaa jayega
 There will not be new jobs
 ab aap puuchhenge ki naukari kam ho jaaegi to kya fark padegaa
 Perfect question
 sirf ye baat kisi yuva se mat kahiyegaa jo piechdi yaa em phil kar desh ke liye padhaane kaa khwab dekh rahaa he
 Then we also want why our universities cannot become like the world's best universities
 ye baat aapaki sahi he
 Can be made absolutely, but we have to see why they are there
 abhi main privet vishvavidhyalay or sarkari vishvavidlaay kii bahes main nahin ghus rahaa
 That is a different issue
 harvard vishvavidhyalay main ek shikshak par 7 chaatro kaa bhaar he
 a teacher at Oxford University has a weight of 11 students
 landan skool of iconomix main ek shikshak par 12 chaatro kaa boj he
 The Delhi University has 20 students on one teacher
 shikshak sangh kaa kahana he ki ujisi ke notification se har teacher par chaatro kaa bhaar or badhegaa or unke liye mumkin nahin hoga ki ve sabhi chaatro kaa khyaal rakh saken
 In the world's leading universities, a teacher has to teach only six hours a week
 ek taraf ham duniya ke vishvavidhyalayon kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, duusari taraf unke paimaanon ke khilaaf niyam bhi bana rahe hai
 In protest against this, the Teachers Association of Delhi University has not been checking the copy of 1 lakh thirty thousand students since May 24
 hazaron naukariyaan jane ke alaava unka kahana he ki teaching aavars main bahut zyaada badhat se research or prashasnic zimmedaariyon par dhyaan dene mushkil hoga
 The API (academic Performance Indicators) target on which teachers are promoted, especially assistant professors, will make their promotion difficult
 tippaniyan Temporary teachers are very bad
 unase shikshan ke alaava jis tarah ke kaam collejon main karaae jate hai wo agar main ginane laguun to aapaki shaam karaab ho jaaegi
 If your mood is fine, let me tell you a little bit
 maheene main ek yaa do baar yoga class main rahanaa hota he
 For this, one has to leave the house at five o'clock because the yoga class is at half past six
 agar padhaane kii class baarah baje se ho to aapako kalege main paanch ghante intazaar karnaa hota he
 One has to attend the days of Central and State Government, such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Good Governance
 in diwason main chaatro ko jamaa karne se lekar lunch coupon baantne kaa kaam shaamil hota he
 There is a departmental meeting on every third fourth day, many times the meeting is held during class time
 class chhod kar meeting main nahin gaye to prisimple naaraaz, class nahin gaye to chaatr naaraaz
 Creating, uploading data of college government work is all this work too
 college kii partiyon main asthaayee teacher security ke taur par maujuud rahete hai
 Temporary teachers have to do many such tasks in addition to teaching
 diu main paanch hazaar ke kareeb asthaayee shikshak kyon hai
 This is also a question
 iskaa matlab he itane shikshakon kii zarurat he to naukari kyon nahin di jaati
 Do you or do we know how many jobs are lost every year in all universities
 kitne pad asthaayee rah jate hai or sthaayee rup se bhare nahin jate
 In July 2014, Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani told the Lok Sabha that 16,692 posts are approved in 39 central universities, out of which 6251 posts are vacant
 ye to khaali kii sankhya thi
 It would have been interesting to know that the posts which were not vacant were permanent appointments or temporary
 jaise diu main hi asthaayee shikshakon kii sankhya 5000 hazaar bataai jaati he
 If the statistics of the universities of all the states of the country came, it would be right to know how many posts are approved and how many posts are being appointed temporarily
 ye sirf padhaane kaa hisaab he
 i have not given account of administrative work because it becomes difficult to give every fine information in TV
 ujisi or vishvavidhyalay ummid bhi karata he ki har shikshak itnaa kaam karne ke baad research main bhi utana hi behatar kare
 It has happened that teachers who want to do only better teaching have been made less, meaning teaching will be considered only when you do research

 The Delhi University has 20 students on one teacher
 shikshak sangh kaa kahana he ki ujisi ke notification se har teacher par chaatro kaa bhaar or badhegaa or unke liye mumkin nahin hoga ki ve sabhi chaatro kaa khyaal rakh saken
 In the world's leading universities, a teacher has to teach only six hours a week
 ek taraf ham duniya ke vishvavidhyalayon kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, duusari taraf unke paimaanon ke khilaaf niyam bhi bana rahe hai
 In protest against this, the Teachers Association of Delhi University has not been checking the copy of 1 lakh thirty thousand students since May 24
 hazaron naukariyaan jane ke alaava unka kahana he ki teaching aavars main bahut zyaada badhat se research or prashasnic zimmedaariyon par dhyaan dene mushkil hoga
 The API (academic Performance Indicators) target on which teachers are promoted, especially assistant professors, will make their promotion difficult
 tippaniyan Temporary teachers are very bad
 unase shikshan ke alaava jis tarah ke kaam collejon main karaae jate hai wo agar main ginane laguun to aapaki shaam karaab ho jaaegi
 If your mood is fine, let me tell you a little bit
 maheene main ek yaa do baar yoga class main rahanaa hota he
 For this, one has to leave the house at five o'clock because the yoga class is at half past six
 agar padhaane kii class baarah baje se ho to aapako kalege main paanch ghante intazaar karnaa hota he
 One has to attend the days of Central and State Government, such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Good Governance
 in diwason main chaatro ko jamaa karne se lekar lunch coupon baantne kaa kaam shaamil hota he
 There is a departmental meeting on every third fourth day, many times the meeting is held during class time
 class chhod kar meeting main nahin gaye to prisimple naaraaz, class nahin gaye to chaatr naaraaz
 Creating, uploading data of college government work is all this work too
 college kii partiyon main asthaayee teacher security ke taur par maujuud rahete hai
 Temporary teachers have to do many such tasks in addition to teaching
 diu main paanch hazaar ke kareeb asthaayee shikshak kyon hai
 This is also a question
 iskaa matlab he itane shikshakon kii zarurat he to naukari kyon nahin di jaati
 Do you or do we know how many jobs are lost every year in all universities
 kitne pad asthaayee rah jate hai or sthaayee rup se bhare nahin jate
 In July 2014, Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani told the Lok Sabha that 16,692 posts are approved in 39 central universities, out of which 6251 posts are vacant
 ye to khaali kii sankhya thi
 It would have been interesting to know that the posts which were not vacant were permanent appointments or temporary
 jaise diu main hi asthaayee shikshakon kii sankhya 5000 hazaar bataai jaati he
 If the statistics of the universities of all the states of the country came, it would be right to know how many posts are approved and how many posts are being appointed temporarily
 ujisi ne in sab gatividhiyon ko pehle Direct Teaching Hours main shaamil kiya tha, magar ab isaki paribhaasha badal kar isamen se tutorils ko baahar kar diya gaya he matlab tutorial ko shikshan nahin mana jayega
 And universities are not known, but there is a system in DU where the teacher takes separate classes with small groups of students where they talk about the main lecture whether they understood it or not
 yah class bhi ek tarah se lacture jaisaa ho jaataa he
 Now i have understood that UGC has said that in these 6 hours, you will have to take tutorials, seminars, administrative work, innovation and update the content of the course
 kyon karnaa hoga isaki koi vajah nahin bataai gai he
 We will talk about what will happen with this, but that is why it is being said
 sthaayee shikshakon kaa kaary bhaar badha dene se vishvavidlaayon main nai naukariyon kii sambhaavnaaen kam ho jaaengi
 This will not give jobs to young teachers and will leave the job of teachers teaching temporarily for many years
 keval dilli vishvividhyalay main paanch hazaar asthaayee shikshakon kii naukari ja sakati he
 In the rest of the universities of the country, the post of teachers will continue to decrease
 nai naukariyaan nahin hongi
 Now you will ask what will be the difference if the job is reduced
 bilkul sahi sawaal he
 Do not just say this to a young person who is looking for the dream of teaching for the country by doing phd or M

 Right now i am not entering into a private university and government university debate
 wo alag masalaa he
 a teacher at Harvard University has a load of 7 students

 Teachers Association says that UGC notification will increase the burden of students on every teacher and it will not be possible for them to take care of all students
 duniya ke namchin vishvavidhyalayon main ek teacher ko hafte main chah ghante hi padhaane hote hai
 On the one hand we are dreaming of universities of the world, on the other hand we are also making rules against their standards
 iske virodh main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke shikshak sangh 24 may se 1 lakh tees hazaar chaatro kii copy nahin jaanch rahe hai
 In addition to going to thousands of jobs, he says that the increase in teaching hours will make it difficult to focus on research and administrative responsibilities

 How many posts remain temporary and are not filled permanently

 i am sad that he decided to retire
 wo ritair nahin hote to acha hota
 He said, seeing the way Sachin played today, i felt that he could play one more year, but he did not know what he thought and why
 'lata ne kaha, 'meri najar main sachin mahaan insaan hai
 Sachin is a very big cricketer, the world knows this, but in my view he is a very decent person, very less talkative, very quiet
 maine kabhi kisi se jhagada karte sachin ko nahin dekha
 Sometimes he is given a wrong out even if he does not complain, he holds the bat and goes inside
 aisa koun karata he, insaan gussa ho jaataa he par sachin bahut hi sharif or nek insaan hai
 When Lata ji was asked if she would go to the stadium to watch Sachin's last match, she said, "I am thinking and i was going to go today
" lekin bheed se thodaa dar lagata he, kyonki kai tarah kii bimaariyaan faili hui hai
 So today i did not go, otherwise i was going to go
 'unase poocha gaya ki jab se sachin ne ritair hone kaa faisla liya he, uske baad se kya sachin se unki baat hui he to lata ne kaha ki baat to nahin hui lekin master blaster ke is faisle se unhen dukh jarur hua he
 He said, 'I never told anyone that they should not retire, they can play and they should play because they are there
 sachin cricket he, cricket sachin he
 i do not consider the two as separate
 wo jite hai to cricket ke liye jite hai
 Such a person should not have left so soon

 But this fact has been proved wrong by the grandmother of Punjabi actress Monica Gill

 The most important thing is that the grandmother of actress Monica Gill had a big accident about 2 months ago, but even after that, she did not give up and stood on her feet and also performed a tremendous dance with the family
 monica gil ne apni daadi kaa dance video soshal media par bhi share kiya he, jise dekhakar log kaaphi hairaan hai
 Almost exactly two months after a major accident, she's dancing
 She not only stunned doctors, but opened my eyes to what inner strength truly means
 Not once did she loose hope
 She was so unbelievably positive
 
 
 she even bore the pain of a badly reduced arm for almost a month before any of us even realised she was in pain
 
 
 She turns 87 on the 22 of this month
 If this isn't the greatest example of perseverance, resilience, strength, and straight magic, then i don't know what is
 # grandmagilla post shared by Monica Gill (@monica_gill1) on Dec 11, 2019 at 10:38pm PST In the video, seeing Monika Gill's grandmother's style, anyone will definitely be impressed by them
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone is umr main shandaar dance kar logon ke liye ek misaal tak pesh kii he
 Sharing this, the actress wrote, "she is dancing after about two months of a big accident
 unhone na keval doctors ko hairaan kar diya, balki meri ankhen bhi khol deen or bataa diya ki aantarik shakti kya hoti he
 Not even once did he give up
 vah itani positive hai
 Even he has suffered the pain in his hand for a month before we realize it
 vah is maheene kii 22 taarikh ko 87 umr kii ho jaaengi
 If this is not an example of perseverance, flexibility, strength and magic then i don't know what will happen

 The JPC report on the 2G scam is not taking the name of the dissent
 bhartiya janata party (BJP) ne aakraamak rukh akhriyaar kar liya he
 Party leaders are attacking Congress on all sides
 unke nishane par hai pradhanmantri manmohan singh or jepisi ke chairman pi si chaako
 While BJP leader Prakash Javadekar called the JPC report as just Protect Congress report, Yashwant Sinha once again wrote a letter to the PM to appear before the JPC
 ravishankar prasad ne report par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki is report main piem or vitt mantri kii bhoomika par chuppi kyon he
 In fact, the draft of the JPC report created a ruckus
 aaj tak komili exclusive jaankaree ke anusaar ghotaale kii jaanch par bani jepisi ne pradhanmantri ko clin chit de di he or doorsanchaar mantralay ko katghare main khadaa kiya he
 The draft report reportedly stated that the government suffered a loss of Rs 40,000 crore during the rule of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki piem ko bachaane ke liye congress draft report main vaajapeyi or endie sarkaar ko doshi tehraane main juty he
 BJP has opened its front against JPC President PC Chacko
 haalanki pisi chaako ne in aaropon kaa khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki is report main kahin bhi vaajapeyi ke naam kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 Whereas the DMK is angry that after being targeted by the CAG, its draft leader and former Telecom Minister A
 raja par galat tareeke se 2ji spectrum aavanton kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 PM letter written by Yashwant Sinha Meanwhile, BJP leader Yashwant Sinha has once again written a letter to the PM
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha he ki jepisi ke saamne pesh hue bagaiyr piem bedaag sabit nahin honge
 Yashwant said that the pm's silence on the allegations of A
 Raja is dangerous
 pradhanmantri ko raja ke aaropon kaa jawaab dena hoga
 According to Yashwant Sinha, the reply given by the PM is being denied by his former ministers
 unhone kaha ki ve 2ji par jepisi kii report ko paas nahin hone denge
 All decisions taken in pm's information: a telecom minister a Raja trapped in a Raja 2G case sent a written note to JPC, in which Raja said if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rejoined me in the cabinet if i was guilty? A
 Raja wrote in his 100-page note that i have not taken any decision alone regarding 2G allocation
 maine sabhi nirnay pradhanmantri or vitt mantri ke saath-saath isse jude adhikariyon kii jaankaree main liye hai
 Raja said that i had to write this note because the JPC president did not call him to present his side despite his constant demand
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh 6 maheene ke liye raajnneeti se dur rahenge
 Digvijay Singh met Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday morning
 iske baad diggi ne congress mukhyalay aakar koshadhyaksh motilal vora se mulaakaat kii or eisisi ko 6 maheene ke liye alavida kah diya
 Diggi Raja is leaving for Narmada Yatra after taking a break from politics
 philhal wo party mahasachiv bane rahenge, lekin kisi rajya kaa prabhaar nahin dekhenge
 Diggi Rajane, the Congress General Secretary and twice Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, has decided to stay away from politics for 6 months
 somvaar ko brake se pehle aakhri baar 24 akbar road aaye diggi ne party kaa kaam koshadhyaksh motilal vora ko saunp diya
 Diggi is currently the general secretary and is also in charge of Andhra Pradesh
 rahul kii gujarat yatra se pehle unhone party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se milakar apni yatra kii jaankaree di or rahul ko unki gujarat yatra ke liye shubhakamanaayen deen
 Earlier on Saturday, he has met Congress President Sonia Gandhi in this connection
 3300 kilometre kii narmada parikrama main unhen 6 maheene lagenge
 Digvijay is describing this journey as a non-political and spiritual journey
 diggi bhale hi apni yatra ko raajnneetik makasad se pare bataa rahe hon, lekin madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle unki yatra ne rajya main siyaasi sugabugahat paidaa kar di he
 During his 3300 km journey along the banks of the Narmada, Diggi will pass through 110 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh and 20 assembly seats in Gujarat
 haalanki diggi rajya kii raajnneeti main lautne se inkaar karte rahe hai
 After losing the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections in 2003, Diggi had said that he would not contest any election for the next 10 years and he followed it
 2004 se wo party ke mahasachiv hai, lekin kuch maheene pehle unhone sonia gandhi se milakar sabhi rajyon kaa prabhaar lene kii guzarish kii thi
 The Congress had almost freed him from the party's activities
 ab jab 6 maheene baad diggi sanghathan main vaapasi karenge to unka rajanithik bhavishya kya hoga
 Many speculations are being made on this
 digvijay ne is yatra se pehle madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko khat bhi likhaa he ki, unki yatra ke dauraan mobile shauchalay kii vyavastha kara di jaae, jisase svachh bharat mishan safal rahe
 In fact, Digvijay feels that his Narmada Yatra will pass through the jungles and rural areas, people can come on their own, because of lack of toilets there, it can lead to chaos
 isse swatchta mishan par palitha lag saktaa he
 At the same time, Diggi, who has described his journey as spiritual and religious, has decided that during this period, he will not make any political rhetoric nor make any political comment on social media
 vah sirf rahul gandhi ke or congress party ke aadhikarik twit hi retweet karenge
 New cases of dengue and chikungunya have been reported in Delhi amid the increased humidity with rains
 27 may tak saamne aae maamalon ke aadhaar par emsidi ne jo report jari kii he usamen jahaan dengue ke 40 maamle saamne aae hai to vahiin dilli main chikangunia ke maamle teji se centuri kii taraf bad rahe hai
 As of May 27, there have been 96 reported cases of chikungunya
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki pichley saal is vakt tak dilli main chikangunia kaa ek bhi maamla saamne nahin aayaa tha
 But since the beginning of summer this year, cases of chikungunya have started coming up
 vahiin pichley saal 27 may tak jahaan dengue ke 13 maamle saamne aae the vahiin is baar ye badhkar 40 tak pahunch chuke hai
 Humidity is the biggest reason: If the health department of MCD believes that the biggest reason behind this is the increase in humidity in Delhi
 beete 1 hafte se dilli main umas he jisane machharon kii sankhya badha di he
 At the same time, the danger is greater because the rains that occurred last week and after that the humidity will be affected this week, due to which it is feared that cases of dengue and chikungunya may increase further next week
 south dilli ko raahatadilli main bhale hi chikangunia or dengue ke maamle bad rahe hai lekin south dilli ke liye beetaa haftaa raahat kii khabar lekar aayaa he kyonki south emsidi ke mutabik pichley ek hafte se south emsidi ke antargat aane vaale ilaakon mendengue or chikanguniyaaka ek bhi maamla saamne nahin aayaa he
 Let us tell you that in Delhi this year, mosquito larvae have been found in 17 thousand 314 houses, while 1612 people have been processed so far
 dilli main beete 7 dinon se dharne par baithe DTC ke asthaayee karmchaariyon ke samarthan main pahuncheyogendra yadavane kaha ki samaan kaam ke liye samaan vetan koi sarvocch nyaayalay kaa aadesh nahin
 It is written in our Constitution and it is very shameful that even after 70 years of independence, people have to fight for equal pay for equal work
 ditisikarmchaariyon ki maang he ki sabhi anubandhit karmchaariyon ko niyamit kiya jaae va samaan kaam ke liye samaan vetan diya jaae
 Let us tell you that DTC Workers Unity Center (actu) in Delhi Transport Corporation has given notice of one day strike on 29 October which has been supported by other unions - DTC Workers Union (AITUC) and DTC Employees Congress (INTUC)
 aage dilli ke mukhyamantri arvindakejarivalpar hamalaa karte hue yogendra yadav bole aaj jo kejariwal kii sarkaar he, yahi kejariwal chunaav ke samay gum-gum kar sabhaaon main kehete the ki agar hamaari sarkaar ai to sabhi anubandh karmchaariyon kii niyamit kiya jayega
 Not only this, the sin of this Kejriwal government's promised khalifa during the elections has also been imposed on us somewhere
 sarkaar ne hamen murkh banaaya haidrasal, pradarshan main baithe karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki kejariwal sarkaar ne chunaav ke pehle vaada kiya tha ki agar unki sarkaar banati he to 13 hajaar karmchaariyon ko pakkaa kar diya jayega
 Currently 13,000 employees work on contracts in DTC
 karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne hamen murkh banaaya he
 Kejriwal government has put ESMA (ESMA)
 On the question of the employees dismissed by the Kejriwal government, Yogendra Yadav said that the government which tries to impose ESMA to suppress any movement cannot be a government of the common man
 yah to taanaashaahee sarkaar he
 It may be noted that the Kejriwal government has imposed ESMA (ESMA) on the ruthless steps of DTC employees
 hamaari maang puri kar lee jaaenditisi ke karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki ham sarkaar ko pehle hi chetavanee de rahe hai
 May our demands be fulfilled
 ham log abhi bhi sarkaar ko ek maheene kaa samay de rahe hai ki wo hamen lekar vichaar karen
 If we are not cleared till February 5, we will hold a rally against the government and protest
 ye raily bas depo se dilli sachivalay tak nikaali jaaegi
 5 lakh people travel daily, if we talk about DTC buses of Delhi, then about 5 lakh people travel daily in these buses
 ab agar ditisi bason kii raftaar tham gai to dilli main kaaphi pareshaani dekhne ko mil sakati he
 In such a situation, the government should talk to these employees and find a solution to this problem
 jisase dilli kii bason main safar karne waalon ko kisi tarah kii pareshaani naa hon
 DTC Employees Union claims that the strike on Monday will be the biggest strike in 30 years
 daawa ye bhi he ki beete kai dinon se ditisi karmchaariyon kii hadtaal somvaar ko sabase viraat rup lene ja rahi he
 However, it suffered a setback on Sunday when the unions backed off from the strike
 somvaar ko basen sadakon par nahin utaarengeal india central council of trade unions AICCTU- dilli ke mahasachiv abhishek kaa kahana he ki ditisi kii chaar union main se ek union yani BJP samarthit bhartiya majdoor sangh ne hadtaal se khud ko alag kar liya he
 Despite this, three registered unions are still on strike and they will not take buses on the roads on Monday
 hadtaal kii maangen hai :1
 The pay cut circular should be withdrawn immediately
 2
 Equal work, equal pay should be applied
 3
 DTC fleet should be increased, privatization of mass transport should be stopped
 karmchaariyon ke kanoonee adhikaron kaa ditisi prabandhan or dilli sarkaar dwaara lagaataar hanan kiya ja rahaa he
 The DTC management issued a circular of pay cut on 21 August last, ignoring the demands of the employees and unfairly citing the Delhi High Court decision
 kyon maang kar rahe hai bason kii sankhya badhaane kii?ditisi karmchaariyon kaa yah nirnay dilli main gadiyon ke badhate pradooshan tathaa aam janata ke liye sasti, sulabh or tikaoo saarvajanik yatayaat kii suvidha uplabdh karaane ke liye bhi bahut mahatvapurn he
 DTC is the backbone of public transport system in Delhi but today there is a huge shortage of buses in Delhi
 ditisi ke paas keval 3000 basen hai jabaki dilli ko 10,000 se bhi zyada bason kii zarurat he
 Instead of increasing the number of buses, the government is transferring Delhi's roads to private cluster companies
 dilli metro ke badhate kiraaye or pradooshan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ditisi hi ekmaatr sarvasulabh, sasti or pradooshan mukt saarvajic yatayaat kaa saadhan bachataa he
 Today, even in Haryana and Rajasthan, the roadways workers are fighting against the privatization and contractualization being done by the BJP governments there
 tab dilli sarkaar ko dilli vaasiyon ke hit ko dekhte hue ditisi karmchaariyon kii maangon par turant kaarywahi kerani chahie
 More than 10 thousand DTC employees took part to tell you that between 25 to 28 September, in connection with the strike at all DTC depots in Delhi, a strike ballot ie 98 was conducted
 2 fisadi yani 10 hajaar se bhi zyada ditisi karmchaariyon hissaa liya
 Only after this vote, it was decided that a one-day strike would be held on Monday
 philhal is hadtaal se ek union walk out kar chuki he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how successful this strike is

 In a scathing attack on the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh over corruption, Congress President Sonia Gandhi alleged that the BJP has more teeth to eat and more to show
 jhabua jile kii meghnagar tehsil mukhyalay ke nikat agraal gaanv ke rajeev gandhi adarsh vidya bhawan skool ke maidan par ek chunavi raily main sonia ne kaha, hamaari nigaah main bhrashtachar ke jo bhi maamle aae, un par kanoonee karrwai kii gai or logon ko padon se hatana padaa, lekin aap yahaan bhaajapa sarkaar se puuchhie ki itane mantriyon ke bhrashtachar ke maamle lokayukta main darj hai, afasaron ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle saamne aae hai, usne un par kya karrwai kii he

 The Congress President said that it is the responsibility of the Center to provide resources and funds to the states, but it is also the responsibility of the state to use it with full sincerity for the well being of the lives of its people
 centre kii upie sarkaar isliye rajyon ko dhan nahin detii ki vah chand logon kii jeb main chalaa jaae or yahaan bhaajapa sarkaar main yahi hua he
 He said that to fight against diseases like corruption, we have enacted the Right to Information Act, so that the general public can legally obtain government information

 upachunaav main sabhi varisht netaaon kii duty lagaai jaaegi
 Organizational responsibility may also be given based on the outcome
 sanghathan main sangharsh karne vaale or vishwaasapatro ko hi tavajjo dene kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Ravidas Mehrotra, who was a minister in the SP government, told news agency IANS, 'time is still going on for SP
 aise main hamen bharosemand or sangharshwan padaadhikari chahie
 Keeping this in mind, the party will set up new committees
 nai kaaryakarini main lokanayak ke sangharsho se prerit puraane or nae chehron ko shaamil kiya jayega
 'he said,' all the sections in the committees will be taken care of
 pichde, ati pichde, muslim or dalit varg ke logon ko bhi jimmedaari di jaaegi
 Those people of Dalit society will be added who have good penetration in their class
 party sanghathan upachunaav kii taiyaari main majbootee ke saath laga hua he
 The selection process is underway
 'purv mantri ne kaha, 'hamaara sansadeey board pratyaashiyon ke chayan main laga hua he
 Along with seniors in the by-election, new candidates will also field
 ham log puri takat se virodhiyon ko jawaab denge
 sp's new executive will be announced soon
 'pichley loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main congress or basapa se gathbandhan kaa prayog vifal hone ke baad samaajawaadee party sanghathan kii 'overhaling' par adhik focus kar rahi he
 This time, there is an exercise to give a place to the confidant and the family members who lost the elections
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki sapa main ab jo sanghathan banegaa, usamen upachunaav chota hissaa he
 The most important for them is the election of 2022
 sapa ke liye 2022 astitv kii antim ladaai he, isliye aisa sanghathan banaaya jayega, jisamen sab kuch samahit ho
 In the by-election, there is a challenge for the SP to outperform the BSP, as the BSP will also contest the by-election for the first time
 isi kaaran sapa upachunaav main chote dalon se bhi samjhauta kar unke vot bank kaa laabh lenaa chaahati he
 This is the reason that the alliance talks with Omprakash Rajbhar's Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (subhaspa) are going on
 sutara bataate hai ki abhi ek-do dal or bhi sapa se upachunaav ke liye sampark kar rahe hai
 The party which will do better in the SP BSP will raise its hopes for the same in the 2022 assembly elections
 saal 2022 ke liye sanghathan taiyaar karte samay sapa sari jatiyon kii goti bithakar sabko samahit karne kaa prayaas karegi
 In the Padmavati case, Sanjay Leela Bhansali appeared for more than two and a half hours on Thursday in the Parliamentary Committee
 bhansaali se kai sawaal kiye gaye
 He has been given two weeks time for written answers to some questions
 jaaniye cameti ne kya sawaal puche
 # 1
 sensor board ko film bhejne se pehle aapane media main kuch logon ko film kyon dikhaai? iskaa kya matlab he
 # 2
 aapane 11 november ko film sensor board ke paas bheji or khud se hi elaan kar diya kii film 1 disambar ko relies hogi jabaki aapako maaloom he ki sensor board ke paas film ko certificate dene ke liye 68 din kaa samay hota he
 How did you decide to date yourself? # 3
 jab pichley dedh saal se vivaad chal rahaa he tab aapane ise thik karne ke liye kadam kyon nahin uthaaya? # 4
 When all the names and all the characters in films are taken from history, then how can it be said that the film has nothing to do with history
 # 5
 Is it true that you had earlier promised the Karni Sena that the film would be shown to them? # 6
 kya film main johar kaa drishy dikhaaya gaya he? kya sati pratha ko filmon main dikhaaya ja saktaa he?sansadeey cameti ke saamne peshi ke baad padmavati ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali ne safai bhi di he
 Bhansali said, 'the story of my film Padmavati is not based on history
 yah malik mohammad jaaysi kii kavita par aadhaarit he
 This statement of Bhansali may give rise to new controversy
 baat den ki malik mohammad jaaysi ne avadhi main 'padmavat' naam se ek mahakavy rachaa tha
 This is the story of Rani Padmini
 jiske mutabik rani ke rup main mohit sultan allaudin khilji unhen kisi bhi haal main paanaa chahta tha, iske liye usne chittod par hamalaa kiya, lekin hajaaron rajput mahilaon ke saath rani padmini ne aag main kudakar johar kar liya tha
 Taking care, BJP cms ban Padmavati: Jaitlysanjay Leela Bhansali and Censor Board President Prasoon Joshi appeared before Parliament's Information and Technology Committee
 14 sadasyeey is cameti ke 8 sadasyon ke saamne prasoon joshi pesh hue
 Two members from the BJP demanded a ban on the film, while a Shiv Sena member supported it
 baaki ke sadasyon ne kaha ki jab sensor board ne film ko manjuuri hi nahin di he to bain kaa sawaal kahaan se uthta he
 Prasoon Joshi said before the Parliamentary Committee that he had not seen the film yet
 film ko pehle riginal cameti dekhegi or phir central cameti
 The censor board will first take the opinion of the experts and then come to a conclusion
 meeting main sensor board chif se poocha gaya ki kya film ke promo ko apruv karaayaa gaya tha
 To which he said, yes the promos were approvals
 kuch members ne yah bhi kaha ki commercial phaayde ke liye vivaadon ko tool diya ja rahaa he
 When the shooting of the film and TV serials came to a halt, the Hearing Standing Petitions Committee had summoned the director of the film, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, CBFC and officials of the Ministry of Information Broadcasting in front of the Petition Committee of Parliament
 taaki ye pataa kiya ja sake ki is maamle main ab tak kya karrwai hui he
 BJP MP from Chittorgarh CP Joshi said, "we have demanded a ban on Padmavati film in this petition committee, because the film has been tampered with in history
" sensor board ne film ke promon ko paas kiya, lekin us promon main ghumar dance dikhaaya he jis par aapatti he
 We also put this thing in front of the committee
 nirdeshak bhansaali kii taraf se likhit main kamity ko bataaya gaya ki film itihaas ke tathyon par aadhaarit he
 But Jais's Padmavat was written several hundred years after the incident, how can it be true? In response to this question, he said, "is the palace of Padmavati, Raja Ratnasen and Padmavati still imaginary? BJP MP from Kota Om Birla said," We have put our point before the Petition Committee
 nirdeshak ne likhit main kamity ko bataaya tha ki itihaas ke tathyon ke aadhaar par film banaai gai he
 Look at the tampering with censorboard history
 promon ko certificate diya yaa nahin? ye sensor board batayega lekin jo promon or trailor dikhaae ja rahe hai, jab vahiin aapattijanak he to film main kitna aapattijanak hoga

 Without doubt we will need it at every step of life
 unhen hameshaa yaad kiya jaayegaa
 ' aap is baat kii shikaayat nahin kar sakate hai ki bharat main bhaashan kam hote hai
 The work may be reduced but the speech is never reduced
 ab to iskaa sambandh chunaav se bhi nahin rahaa
 And it has been that speaking leaders are losing their patience
 inaki aalochanaon kaa koi matlab nahin rah gaya he
 Because after that some such statement comes that you forget to differentiate whether more shame came earlier or should come now
 loktantr ke girte hue str ke prati hamaari sahansheeltaa badhati ja rahi he
 The leaders are openly making communicative statements or saying something which clearly shows that hatred has been given to spread hatred towards a sect
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he yah to sab thodaa bahut jaanate samajhate hai magar isse naujavaanon se lekar samaaj ke anya hisson main kya asar padataa hoga, hamen vot ke aage jaakar sochna chahie
 i am talking about the statement of BJP MP from Karnataka and Modi government minister Anant Kumar Hegde
 is tarah ke bayaan filmon main mohalle ke dada tip ke kirdaar diya karte the magar ab filmon main bhi is tarah ke seen kam ho gaye hai
 The country has a constitution, a law, a police, a court
 iske baad bhi ek kendiy mantri yah kehete hai ki hindu ladki ko chune vaale haath kaa vajood khatm kar dena chahie
 That is, they are telling the crowd or their supporters that the law is not needed
 is bayaan se ek or matlab nikal saktaa he ki koi hindu ladki ke alaava kisi or kii ladki ko chhu saktaa he
 This sharing of my girl and her girl must be understood
 ek saansad or mantri ko yah kahana chahie ki hamane aisi vyavastha bana di he ki vah kisi ke saath bhedbhaav nahin karti he magar wo to yah kah rahe hai ki vyavastha ko chodo, hindu ladki ko chune vaale haath kaa vajood khatm kar diya jayega
 This statement is a direct communal statement
 or striyon ke viruddh bhi he
 There is also insult to the girls of India
 anant hegade pehle bhi is tarah ke bayaan dete rahe hai
 He did not stop here but also dragged the wife of Karnataka State President Dinesh Gondu Rao
 isse saaf he ki anant kumaar hegade ke dimaag main kya chal rahaa he
 Hegde tweeted that 'I want to ask Dinesh Gundu Rao what he achieved? i know him as a man who has run after a Muslim woman
 yah personal atake tha kyonki gundu raav kii patni muslim hai
 Beware of such communal statements of any kind
 yah sidhe-sidhe nafrat failaane ke makasad se diya gaya he
 In a way, Anant Kumar Hegde wants to decide the personal opinion of today's youth, whom they should marry, whom to love
 gundu raav kii patni muslim hai or donon pachis saal se shaadi shuda hai
 Do you think it is fair for a minister to say so? gundu raav kii patni tabu raav ne ek post likhar anant kumaar hegade ke twit kii aalochana kii he
 Union Minister Hegde has tweeted that i only know Dinesh Gondu Rao because he ran after a Muslim girl
 haa main ek musalmaan paidaa hui hum lekin mujhe pehle bhartiya hone par garv he
 The Constitution of India is built on the foundation of secularism which gives freedom of thought, expression, faith and worship to every person
 maine kabhi kisi bijepi netaa ke kilaaf tippanee nahin kii he
 i strongly oppose the attempt to drag myself into pawns in cheap politics
 agar unamem saahas he to mere pati ko raajnneetik taur par chunauti den na ki patni kii sari ke peeche chhipakar pathar uchhaalen
 It does not suit a minister to make such a manly and inflammatory statement
 kya ab is par raajnneeti hogi ki kisne kisase shaadi kii he
 You will have the theme of Kerala
 haadia ne jab majahab badalakar shaadi kii to neshnal invastigeshan agency tak kaa chapa pad gaya
 Hadia's marriage was canceled by the High Court but she won the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne apane faisle main yah bhi kaha tha ki dharm badalane kaa adhikaar bhi moulik adhikaar he
 The Supreme Court had also strongly criticized the Kerala High Court verdict
 is tarah ke bayaan kyon aa rahe hai jinka makasad ek samudaay ke prati nafrat ko uksaana he
 The Constitution talks of brotherhood
 haal hi main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi isi tevar kaa ek bayaan diya tha
 At a rally in West Bengal
 hindu, sikh, buddha or isai ko darane kii zarurat nahin he
 In his statement the president of a national party is assuring security to the four religions
 ek ko kyon chhod rahe hai vahi bataa sakate hai magar yah saaf he ki ek mazahab ke khilaaf chaar dharmon kaa rakshak banakar wo koun si rekha khinch rahe hai
 People of these four religions should also think that if they do anything, the courts will trust the police or Amit Shah
 phir amit shah ko hi supreme court ghoshit kar den ki vahiin hamaare rakshak or maseehaa honge aaj se
 If you listen to the statement of Amit Shah and Anant Hegde together, you will understand what i am saying
 kya aapako donon ke bayaan main koi antar laga
 Normally, i rarely do programs on statements, our leaders keep on talking to us every day, but the statements of Amit Shah and Anant Hegde are not true
 inke asar main aapke ghar kaa koi noujvaan hinsa kar saktaa he
 He will feel that it is right to raise one's hand in the name of Hindu
 aise main vah gambhir kism ke aparaadh kar saktaa he
 You should protect your children from such statements
 sampradayikta insaan ko maanav bam main badal detii he
 It is not under your control when and on what it will explode
 modi sarkaar ke ek or mantri nitin gadakari ke bayaan par gambhirtha se sochna chahie
 If a minister like Nitin Gadkari talks about beating the leader, it is not fair
 bhale hi us netaa ne jitne sapane dikhaae hon
 If the public takes Gadkari seriously, then there may be a law and order crisis in the country
 hamaare pratinidhiyon ko sena kii suraksha main rakhana hoga
 Therefore, there is an appeal to the public not to take the second part of Gadkari's statement seriously
 kisi par haath uthaanaa bhi jurm he
 Leave aside the beating
 kabhi hindu ke naam par to kabhi public ke naam par peetane or vajood khatm kar dene vaale in bayanon main koi khaas antar nahin he
 Both of them imagine violence
 netaa chaahate hai ki maarane peetane kaa kaam aap karen, jail aap jaaen, cese aap laden or raaj wo karen
 We do not know who is the leader of dreams in Nitin Gadkari's eyes
 unki party kaa he yaa duusari party kaa magar gadakari ne abhi tak khandan kiya he na safai di he
 Congress leaders are saying that Gadkari has pointed towards Prime Minister Modi
 aisa hota to pradhanmantri ab tak unhen hataa chuke hote aakhir ve us vyakti ko kaise apane mantrimandal main rakh sakate hai jo peetane kii baat kare yaa sapane dikhaane ke liye unka mazaaq udaae
 Gadkari did not give any clarification on his behalf, but BJP leaders are doing a lot of practice of cleaning
 aisa lagata he ki is bayaan ko bijepi ke bheetar samajhane kaa kaaphi prayaas hua he
 Let's go to Karnataka once again
 karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri siddharmaiya bhi aapa kho baithe or mahila se abhadata kar baithe
 In the video, you can see that the woman hits the table loudly to make her point and an angry Siddaramaiah gets up and snatches the mike from his hand_ His scarf moves along with the mike
 har lihaaz se siddharmaiya ne abhadrata kii
 BJP did not ask for resignation on the statement of Minister Anant Hegde, but on this action of Siddaramaiah, he has asked Rahul Gandhi when he will ask for his resignation
 siddharmaiya ne jis mahila ke haath se mike chin lee uskaa naam jamila he
 Jamila said that mlas have come here for the first time after the elections
 siddharmaiya ne kaha ki kya aapako vidhayak nahin milte hai
 On this, the woman slapped her hands on the table and said that no sir, the mlas do not meet
 bilkul nahin milte hai
 Just Siddaramaiah got angry
 mike chin lete hai
 First say talk to Tamizh and snatch Mike and say go away from here
 chupchaap baith jaao
 When Jameela tries to speak again, Siddaramaiah gets up and stands up and asks her to sit in a threatening tone, telling her to shut her mouth
 zarur mahila ne mez par haath dekar maar diya magar ek netaa ko samajhnaa chahie ki jab uske paas sabhy tareeke se pesh aane kii bhashaa or sahansheeltaa nahin bachi he to haashiye par khadi janata ke paas kya bachaa hoga
 Still Siddaramaiah could stand up on this response and could comfortably tell him
 mike chhinana or munh band karne kii baat karnaa, ek chune hue pratinidhi ke liye shobhaa nahin detaa he
 In every respect, Siddaramaiah is a powerful person, so doing so should be considered as equal to attacking a woman
 har lihaaz se yah abhadrata he
 Later, Jameela gave a statement, which means so much in this context that he gave clarification but what we all saw happening there was not appropriate from anywhere

 The media has stopped taking interest in democratic demonstrations anyway
 uske liye dharna pradarshan ab myne nahin rakhte
 People who come to the protest demonstration want to show them the media but they should ask themselves a question
 kya jab media kisi or ke dharna pradarshan ko dikhaata he to ve dekhte hai, sochate hai, vichaar karte hai jaankaree jutate hai ki janata kaa doosraa hissaa kyon pareshaan he
 Had our colleague Harisingh not sent this picture, it would not have been known that such a large number of women working in the Ramlila Maidan in Asha, Anganwadi and Mid Day Meal are protesting against the government
 in mahilaon kaa kahana he ki unase rose saat se aath ghante kaam karaayaa jaataa he or rajya sarkarein teen hazaar rupaya hi vetan ke rup main detii hai
 a mid-day meal-sharing woman from Bihar said that she gets only Rs 1250 per month
 jabaki sarkaar ne nunatam vetan 15000 rupee tay kiya he
 Then the government itself does not give them even 40 to 100 rupees a day
 bihar kii mahilaon ne kaha ki 12 maheene kaam karti hai or vetan 10 maheene kaa hi miltaa he
 The demonstration was organized by All India United Trade Union Center
 kai mahilaayein das das saal se ye kaam kar rahi hai magar unhen saamaajik suraksha hasil nahin he
 In order to do research on the Jharkhand Public Service Commission, i challenged the professors of Harvard and Oxford to come to Ranchi on the same ship and research how an examination has not been completed since 2015

 a stalled test
 tamaam rukaawaton ke baad aaj jharkhand lok seva ayog kii mens kii pariksha hui lekin pataa chalaa jo prashn patr aayaa tha wo 25 may 2017 kaa chapa hua he
 You know that many times the date has come out and the exam is canceled, then it seems that the old question paper has been printed
 isi ke virodh main ranchi main jharkhand lok seva ayog ke baahar 100 se adhik chaatro kaa samooh maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar virodh kar rahaa tha
 With your admit card
 hamaare sahyogi harbans ne bataaya ki 25 may 2017 kii pariksha main lagbhag 5100 ummidavaar shaamil hone vaale the lekin court vagairah ke faisle ke baad jo rigelt niklaa usase chaatro kii sankhya 34,664 ho gai
 The exam was to be held on 28 January and the students learned 16 days earlier
 harambus ko sutron ne bataaya ki itani jaldbaazi main 34000 se adhik prashn patr bananaa mushkil tha to in logon ne puraane prashn patr kaa sil tod kar phir se chapai kar lee
 After that, the examination took place today
 chaatr bhi kehete hai ki niabandh ke khand main sawaal poocha gaya tha ki jharkhand ke 16 varsh hone par niabandh likhen jabaki yah 19waan saal chal rahaa he
 Obviously the question paper is old
 yahi nahin mens kii pariksha ke jo farm bhare gaye uski scrootni main lage 55 karmchaariyon main se 18 ne pariksha di he
 This is also not correct
 parikshaarthiyon ko shaq he ki in logon ko prashn patr dekh liya hoga
 If this is true, how sad that the printed question paper of two years ago is being asked
 agast 2015 kii pariksha kaa mens teen saal baad janvari 2019 main ho rahaa he

 isi topic par ek documentry bani he period ind of centens
 It is discussed in full swing, as this documentary has received a nomination in the category of Oscar's Best Documentary
 film kaa hindustan se khaas kanekashan he, kyonki isaki kahani hapur main rahane vaali ladakiyon par buni gai he
 12 students of Oakwood School in California and English teacher Melissa Burton have a special contribution in making this 25-minute documentary
 film kii agxcutive produsar gunit monga hai
 The film is directed by Rayka Zehtabchi
 ise banane ke peeche dilachasp kissa he, okwood skool student ne ek artical main india ke gaanv main period ko lekar shame or hygiene kii nolej nahin hone kaa pataa chalaa
 The children contacted the NGO, collected funds and donated a sanitary machine for the village girls
 phir gaanv main jaagarukta laane ke liye documentry kii shooting kaa plan bana
 How is the story of the film film begins with the question asked by the girls of the village, what is the period? Hearing both questions, they are so ashamed that they do not answer
 phir yahi sawaal gaanv ke skool main padhane vaale ladakon se kiya jaataa he
 They say period is what happens after the bell rings in school
 doosraa ladkaa kahata he ye to ek beemaari he jo auraton ko hoti he, aisa suna he
 This is where the documentary starts
 kahani main hapur kii sneha kaa ahm role he
 Who wants to be admitted to the police
 ek gaavan jahaan kii bujrg mahilaayein periods ko bhagwaan kii marji or ganda khun bataati hai
 Sneha's thinking of the same village is different
 wo kahati he jab durga ko devi maa kehete hai, phir mandir main auraton kii jane kii manaahi kyon he
 The documentary also features an organization named Falai and Arunachalam Muranganatham, real life padman
 unheen kii banaai senetary mashin ko gaanv main lagaaya jaataa he, jahaan ladkiyaan rojgaar ke saath-saath period ke dinon main senetary ke yuj ke sahi myne ko samajhati hai
 Many scenes in the entire documentary are very special, such as the first time girls touch their sanitary pads with their facial expressions
 pad kharidne kii shame
 These all touch the heart and leave the question

 This is an incident in which the accused is the powerful MLA of the ruling party
 local police jisane kabhi peedit ladki kii fariyaad hi nahin suni
 The court had to intervene in this case when an FIR was registered
 aaj se thik ek saal pehle july 2018 main CBI chargeshit daakhil karti he
 The year passed but not a single trial of the trial began
 alam to ye rahaa ki is mukademe kii sunwaayee ke liye koi jaj hi nahin mila
 This would not have happened if the government and administration had woken up a year earlier
 lekin ab ucch nyaayalay ne kaha ki is cese kaa faisla 45 dinon ke bheetar karnaa hoga
 Now justice will be done, Unnao's gang rape victim will also be accounted for
 uske pita ko jail main thunsane kii vajah bhi poochi jaaegi
 He will also be questioned if he is killed in custody
 raibareli road par hue accident kii jaanch bhi hogi
 The kidnapping of the victim will also be argued
 yani kareeb do saal puraane is cese kii ek-ek kalai ab khulegi
 The fear of justice which was close to extinguished due to the fear of BJP MLA in UP and the negligence of the government
 use supreme court ne phir se raushan kar diya he
 So the files that were buried in the Unnao gang rape case
 jo raaj chupe hue the
 They will now be opened one by one before the Supreme Court
 kyonki ab is maamle main rape peedita or uske parivaar ko insaaf dilaane ke liye supreme court ne ye cese apane haath main le liya he
 In the cases related to Unnao rape and accident in UP, the Supreme Court has taken many important decisions during the hearing
 inakon ek ek karke samajhnaa zaruri he
 The first decision is that all the five cases related to the Unnao rape case will be transferred to Delhi
 unnav rape ke mukhya cese kii sunwaayee 45 din ke andar puri hogi
 The investigation into the road accident with the family of the rape victim will be completed in 7 days
 sabase badi adaalat ne rape peedit or uske puure parivaar, unke vakil ko tatkaal CRPF kii suraksha dene kaa aadesh diya he
 The UP government has been asked to provide an interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the aggrieved family
 sadak haadase main ghayal vakil ke parivaar ke liye 20 lakh rupee kaa muaavja dene kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 The court has sought the medical report of the hospitalized rape victim and her lawyer in Lucknow
 supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik doctoron or parivaar kii raay jaanane ke baad rape peedit or uske vakil ko dilli ke ames main laane kaa aadesh diya jayega
 There will also be a hearing on the transfer of the rape victim's uncle in Rae Bareli jail to Delhi jail
 bijepi ke nishkasit vidhayak kuldeep senger ne apni takat ke dam par khud ko bachaane kii koshish to bahut kii, shaayad raahat mil bhi jaati
 But the victim and her family accident on Rae Bareli Road has captured MLA from all four sides
 or ab unke kiye kaa naa sirf hisaab hoga balki bahut jald hisaab hoga
 Understand that MLA ji's gameover is over
 or bahut mumkin he ki is apradhi ko bhi upi kii jail se kisi or jail main shift kar diya jaae
 Kuldeep Sengar is sure to be tight-lipped, but the Uttar Pradesh government has also done its best to save its MLA
 jisane sibiai jaanch ke naam par do saal nikaal die
 And the trial of the case was not started
 upi sarkaar or police-prashasan ne is maamle main zaraa bhi gambhirtha dikhaai hoti
 Neither the father of the victim would have been killed in jail
 naa uske rishtedaar accident kii bhent chadhate or naa hi wo khud aspataal main zindagi or maut kii jang lard rahi hoti
 What is happening in the country? Nothing is happening according to the law
 supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii jubaan se nikali ye do line upi ke sushasan ko bayaan kar rahi hai
 The Unnao gang rape case has confounded the case
 aapako bataa den ki unnav rape cond kii peedita ne accident se 16 din pehle hi supreme court ke chif justise ko chitthee likhi thi
 In which he called the life of his family a threat
 chitthee vakt se chif justise ke paas pahunchi hi nahin
 But when the pain of the victim reached them, action was taken immediately
 24 ghante ke andar supreme court ne upi sarkaar kii dhajjiyaan uda dene vaala aitihaasik aadesh dekar unnav kii beti ke insaaf kii aas jagaa di he
 Let us tell you that on Thursday, the hearing of this case started by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice Anirudh Bose
 is maamle main sakhti dikhaate hue supreme court ne do saal pehle hue gang rape se lekar 28 july ko raibareli road par hue accident tak ke ek ek pahalu kii baariki se jaanch kaa aadesh diya he
 What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood

 giraftaari to chhodie, bijepi ke netaa or purv uttar pradesh or kendriya mantri chinmayanand ke khilaaf balaatkaar kii exiaar tak nahin hui
 Three days have passed when this 23-year-old girl studying law gave her statement in court
 chaatra ne chinmayanand par balaatkaar or yon shoshan ke alaava saal bhar se zyaada tak blackmel karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 His written statement to the Delhi Police has been submitted to the Uttar Pradesh Police, but Chinmayananda has not yet been charged with rape
 somvaar raat ko chinmayanand kaa video jari kiya gaya jisamen unka ilaaj kiya ja rahaa tha
 His people reported that he was complaining of "discomfort and weakness", while his doctors said he had diarrhea
 bijepi netaa or purv kendriya mantri chinmayanand ke khilaaf balaatkaar or blackmel ke aaropon kii jaanch karne ke liye gathit vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) se supreme court ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki media main uthaae gaye sawaalon yaa uttar pradesh ke prabhaavshaalee rajaneta ko bachaane kii koshish ke aaropon se batch nahin sakate
 SIT chief Naveen Arora told reporters that “you have to put some faith in the investigating agency
 yadi jaanch galat disha main ja rahi he, to hai court hamaari nigaraanee karegaa
 They are authorized to take our statements
 ham kisi vyakti yaa media se prabhavit nahin hone rahe hai
 "arora said that" i cannot talk about any amendment in the FIR (against Chinmayananda)
 kisi ko bhi ab tak giraftaar nahin kiya gaya he
 We have only called people for questioning
 ham apni jaanch ko nahin badalenge, kyonki log sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 We do not need a certificate to prove ourselves
 "swami chinmayanand prakaran main buudhvaar ko vishesh jaanch dal ne kaha ki balaatkaar kaa aarope lagane vaali peedita or chinmayanand kii ore se darj karaae gaye maamalon kii abhi kadiyaan jodi ja rahi hai
 SIT chief Naveen Arora said, "we have to submit the full investigation report to the Allahabad High Court by September 23 and he is linking it tightly in both cases to this inquiry
" ''udhar, chinmayanand par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagane vaali peedita ne magistrate ke samaksh bayaan darj karaane ke baad chinmayanand kii jald giraftaar kii maang karte hue kaha ki agar sarkaar intjaar kar rahi he ki vah khud hi mar jaae to vah khud par mitti kaa tel chhidakkar aag laga legi
 Meanwhile, due to the worsening of Chinmayananda's condition, he was admitted to the Government Medical College, Shahjahanpur on Wednesday
 medical college ke mukhya chikitsa adheekshak doctor empi gangavar ne bataaya ki swami chinmayanand ko haalat kharaab hone par unhen medical college laayaa gaya he, jahaan unhen aath number ward main bhartee kar liya gaya he
 He has been seen by the doctor and given necessary medicines
 gangavar ne bataaya ki swami ko bechaini or kamajori ke alaava dast kii samasya he
 a team of doctors is being formed, which will treat them
 esaiti pramukh aroda ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdesh par mukhya sachiv ne yah vishesh jaanch team banaai he
 He said that till now both our investigation crime numbers 442 and 445 have been observed by our team
 police ne jo karrwai kii thi, vah bhi dekhi
 After that the work has been started by planning
 aroda ne bataaya ki unhone mumukshu ashram parisar dekha tathaa kalejon ke praachaarya tathaa staff, jinaki aavashyaktaa thi, unako bulaakar poochtacha kii gai 
 Both the plaintiffs were also called and their statements were recorded
 unase jo bhi aavashyaktaa thi, prashn bhi kiye gaye tathaa peedita kaa bayaan bhi likhaa gaya
 He said that the victim gave an application to the Delhi Police
 vah unhen praapt ho gaya he
 Taking cognizance of it, his team has also made a statement of 164 of the victim
 aroda ne bataaya ki mobile pen drive tathaa gavaahon ke mobile ko sij kar unhen forensik lab bheja gaya he
 Arora said that videos obtained as evidence like viral videos and pen drives have been sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory
 yah bhi dekha jayega ki use edit yaa usamen chhedchhad to nahin kii gai he
 a decision will be taken after this
 esaiti prabharee ne kaha ki ham media trial se ghabaraakar kaary nahin karenge
 Without naming several media institutions, he said that Sanjay and Chinmayananda were even confronted in the news
 unhone kaha ki ham sabhi baton kii nigaraanee kar rahe hai or ham is bare main bhartiya press parishad ko patr likhenge
 On the other hand, the victim said that on the third day of the statement before the magistrate, neither a report of rape and physical abuse has been filed nor Chinmayananda has been arrested
 usne kaha ki aise main sarkaar agar intjaar kar rahi he ki vah khud mar jaae or uske parivaar ko kuch ho jaae to vah khud par mitti kaa tel chhidakkar aag laga legi
 The victim's father says that it is not correct to arrest Chinmayananda even after making a statement before the magistrate and not register a report against him
 uske pita ne kaha ki vishesh jaanch dal bhi unhen koi jaankaree nahin de rahaa he
 In such a situation, he will consult lawyers along with his daughter and son
 udhar viral video main paanch karod kii rangadari maangane ke prakaran main peedita se charchaa karte hue dikhne vaale sanjay singh tathaa unke do saathiyon ko esaiti ne ravivaar ko phir poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa tha, jinhen aaj tak apane paas hi roak rakhaa he
 The SIT has sought records of the land on which Swami Shukdevanand Law College is built, Khasra Khatauni etc
 iske alaava kuch chaatro kaa shaikshik ricard bhi maanga he
 Significantly, a student of LLM studying in Swami Shukdevananda Law College had on August 24 viral a video on Swami Chinmayananda and accused him of physical abuse and life of many girls and threat to her and her family
 is maamle main peedita ke pita kii ore se kotwali shahjahanpur main apharan or jaan se maarane kii dhaaraon main swami chinmayanand ke viruddh maamla darj karaayaa gaya tha lekin isse ek din pehle swami chinmayanand ke adhivaktaa om singh ne paanch karod rupee rangadari maangane kaa bhi mukadmaa darj kara diya tha
 (also from input language) musalamaanon kaa voting adhikaar chhinane kii maang ke baad ab shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main parivaar niyojan kii vakaalat kii gai he
 'saamana' states that the increasing population of Muslims and Christians poses a threat to the Hindus of the country and the cultural-social balance of Hindu land is set to deteriorate
 musalamaanon ko khush or sehatmand rahanaa he, to unke liye chota parivaar thik he
 If this is being said on our behalf, then it is for the benefit of the country and the Muslims

 He wrote that if the votes of the Muslims are available only for bargaining, then this society will always remain in the trough, so the voting right should be taken away from the Muslims to end vote bank politics
 kuch din pehle hi hindu mahasabha kii netaa sadhvi thakur ne bhi kaha tha ki musalamaanon or isaayiyon kii badhati jansankhya ko dekhte hue is samudaay ke logon kii nasbandi karaani hogi, kyonki unki badhati jansankhya hinduon ke liye khatra he
 He also said that Hindus should produce more and more children, so that the world can have an impact
 bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj ne bhi pichley dinon kaha tha ki jab hindu log nasbandi karaate hai, to musalamaanon ko bhi karwaani chahie
 Although he clarified, we do not want the Muslims and Christians of the country to be sterilized, but family planning should be adopted by all

 shivasena (shiv Sena) ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki jammu-kashmir main pidipi se haath milaane ke baad bhaajapa ko chaatr netaa kanhaiya kumaar (kanhaiya Kumar) kii aalochana karne kaa naitik adhikaar nahin he
 Shiv Sena also advised the ruling BJP that it should not take political advantage of the sedition case against Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union
 party ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne piples democratic party (pidipi) kii pramukh mahabuuba mufti se haath milakar ‘paap' kiya
 He said that Mehbooba Mufti considers Afzal Guru a martyr to attack Parliament
 bhaajapa jammu-kashmir main pidipi sarkaar kaa hissaa thi lekin usne pichley saal swayan ko gathbandhan se alag kar liya
 The Delhi Police had on Monday filed a chargesheet against Kanhaiya Kumar and others in the court, saying that he was leading a rally in the JNU campus in February 2016 and supported the slogans of sedition
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr ‘saamana' ke sampadakeey main kaha, ‘bhaajapa ne afjal guru ko swatantraaa senaanee or shahid maanane vaaleen mahabuuba mufti se haath milakar sabase bada paap kiya
 Now the BJP should not take political advantage from the sedition case lodged against Kanhaiya for its own benefit nor should it try to do so
 ' party ne kaha ki 2008 mumbai aatankwaadi hamalon ke doshi ajmal kasaab jaise aatankwaadi ko bhi adaalat ne apana bachaav karne kaa avasar diya
 He said that Kumar will also be given a chance to present his case
 usne kaha ki yadi uske khilaaf lage aarope sahi nahin hai, to ve adaalat main tik nahin paaenge
 The party said, 'kanhaiya Kumar is a good speaker
 vah baagi or berozegaar yuvaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, tab bhi vah afjal guru kii prashansa karte hue yaa kashmir kii aazaadee ke naare nahin laga sakate
 Anyway, what moral right does the BJP have to condemn Kanhaiya Kumar? '
 shivasena ne kataaksh kiya, ‘maharashtra bhaajapa ke mantri girish mahajan ne haal main daawa kiya ki unhen jahaan bhi bheja jayega, vah apana ‘jaadu' dikhaaenge or chunaav main apni party kii jeet sunishchit karenge
 We request the BJP to send them there to defeat the national opponents in JNU, but tell them that elections in JNU are not held through evms

 in / is shuukravaar release hui he 'happy anding', jise diarect kiya he raaj nidimoru or krishna dike ne
 
 
 The film is produced by Dinesh Vijan and co-creator Saif Ali Khan
 
 
 film main mukhya bhoomikaaon main hai saf ali khan, eliana decruge, priti zinta, kalki koechalin, ranvir shouri or govinda
 
 
 Saif Ali Khan's character in the film is UD, and Ileana plays Aanchal
 
 
 donon hi lekhak hai, or kitaaben likhte hai
 
 
 UD is a heartfelt person, but also very lazy
 
 
 yudi kii ek kitaab chah saal pehle ai thi, jo bahut badi hit hui thi or is kitaab kii kamyaabi main yudi chah saal kaat detaa he
 
 
 Then suddenly he realizes that his pocket is empty and he will have to start working again to earn money
 
 
 yudi shaadi kii kamitment se bhi bachataa he, jiske chalate uskaa kai baar brake-ap ho chukaa he
 
 
 Here, Govinda plays an actor whose career is on the verge of sinking, and wants to do a hit that is well-liked by both multiplex and single-screen audiences
 
 
 to kya hoga govinda kii film kaa, or anchal kaa, yani eliana, kaa saath milane ke baad kya yudi kii zindagi kii 'happy anding' ho paaegi, yah sab jaanane ke liye aapako cinemaghar kaa rukh karnaa padegaa
 
 
 Now talk about the shortcomings and merits of the film
 
 
 pehle baat khaamiyon kii
 
 
 'happy ending' may remind you of the film 'love Nowadays', so you will not feel new in the story
 
 
 mujhe puri film main kahani kii kami nazar ai
 
 
 The majority of the film was supported by a few scenes filmed between the main characters
 
 
 saral shabdon main kah sakate hai ki film main kai manoranjak seens to chalate dikhte hai, lekin kahani aage nahin badhati, or isi ye seens film ko kamazor karte hai
 
 
 Ranveer Shorey's part seems unnecessary in the film
 
 
 inkaa kirdaar manoranjan to karata he, lekin kahani main yogadan na ke baraabar dikhataa he
 
 
 In the second part, the film also pulls a bit
 
 
 aisa bhi nahin he ki film main sirf khamiyaan hai
 
 
 So, in terms of merits, Raj and DK liked the way of story telling
 
 
 film kai jagah aapako hansane par majaboor karegi
 
 
 Govinda looks good in the film, and his work is also good
 vahiin saf bhi film main mujhe achche lage, or saath hi acha laga unka alter igo, yani unka apper-swaroop, jinase vah film main baaten karte hai
 
 
 Preity, Kalki and Ileana - all three have done justice to their characters
 
 
 film ke gane pehle hi logon kii jubaan par chadh chuke hai, so, film ke liye yah plus point rahaa
 
 
 Ranveer Shorey's character is strange, but his work is worthy
 
 
 udhar, film kii editing bhi mujhe acchhee lagi
 
 
 Perhaps the younger generation may like the film, so my rating for this film is - 3 stars

 Thousands of nurses of government hospitals in the state went on strike demanding increase in their salary and allowances

 Actually, doctors have to postpone many pre-determined operations

 Only emergency services are being operated in government hospitals

 bharat mata kii jai bolne se inkaar karne vaale AIMIM ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ko lekar sadak se sansad tak siyaasi bavaal ke baad ab islamic shikshan sanstha daarul ulum ne ise lekar fatwa jari kar diya he
 In the fatwa issued by Darul Uloom Deoband, saying that Bharat Mata ki Jai is not valid for Muslims
 pichley dinombharat mata kii jaibolne ko lekar ovaisi ke baad daarul ulum ke muftiyon se sawaal puche ja rahe the
 These questions were discussed in the meeting of the eight-member Liberation Bench held in Darul Ifta two days ago
 jiske baad hawala number 545 (bi) main muftiyon ne jawaab diya ki kai saal pehle vande maataram kaa masalaa uthaa tha
 It was made necessary for hindu-muslim reading in schools
 ab bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa har musalmaan ke liye jaruri kiya ja rahaa he
 These two issues are the same
 'hindustan se mohabbat he lekin bhagwaan nahin maanate'daarul ulumake muftiyon ne kaha, 'vande maataram ke bare main yahaan se likhaa gaya tha ki hindustan hamaara vatan he
 We and our ancestors were born here
 yah hamaara maadare vatan (mathrubhumi) he, ham isse mohabbat karte hai lekin ham is vatan ko apana mabood (bhagwaan) nahin samajhate
 He further said, because Muslims believe in God being one, they cannot worship anyone other than God
 isliye musalamaanon ko is geet se alag rakhaa jaae
 Now Bharat Mata ki Jai's slogan is being forced
 darasal bharat mata ek tabake ke yakeen ke mutabik ek devi he, jisaki wo puja karte hai
 These people consider Bharat Mata Devi as the owner and power of India
 'kisi ko majaboor nahin kiya ja saktaa'islamic shaikshik sanstha ne kaha ki islam ke maanane vaale musalmaan kabhi aise naare se samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 According to the Indian Constitution, every person of India has been given independence
 kisi phirakaaprast ko yah haq hasil nahin ki wo kanoon ke khilaaf koi kaam kare or dusron ko gaiyr kanoonee kaam karne par majaboor kare

 The Delhi Women's Commission (DCW) on Tuesday issued a notice to the Delhi Police in the case of death of children from diphtheria at Maharishi Valmiki Hospital

 In September 2018, 21 children died of diphtheria within 13 days
 is maamle main mahila ayog ne nagar nigam ko notice bhejkar jawaab maanga tha
 The Municipal Corporation formed an inquiry committee on the incident
 samiti ne apni jaanch report main paaya ki aspataal main 2 disambar 2017 se lekar 22 sitambar 2018 tak anti-dipthiria vaxin kaa koi bhi stock maujuud nahin tha
 a hospital team visited CRI Kasauli for the vaccine on February 26 last year after about 3 months
 siarai ne bataaya ki unke paas vaxin uplabdh nahin he magar centre sarkaar ke swasthya mantralay se anumati milane par ve vaxin bana sakate hai
 Two months after this, on April 28, a letter was written by the Health Directorate of the Government of Delhi seeking permission from the Central Government to manufacture the vaccine
 phir 31 july ko dilli sarkaar ke swasthya nideshaalay kii ore se ek patr aayaa jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki vaxin ke pehle batch kii supplai 30 sitambar 2018 tak siarai kasauli se hogi
 On 9 August 2018, the hospital issued a tender to purchase the vaccine, in which two companies participated
 yah tender cancil kar diya gaya kyonki ucch adhikariyon se apruval nahin mila tha
 Apart from this, according to the report, the infrastructure of the hospital also had many shortcomings
 aspataal ke dipthiria ward main prakaash kii vyavastha thik nahin thi, isiu kii uplabdhta nahin thi, Anti-arrythmic davaaiyaan uplabdh nahin thim, oparation theatre or Tracheostomy kii suvidha uplabdh nahin thi, aspataal main ambulance, eks-re aadi kii suvidha nahin thi jiske liye paas ke arabitibi aspataal kii sevaayen lee jaati thim, saath hi aspataal main blad bank kii suvidha bhi nahin thi
 The Women's Commission has said that if medicines were available on time, the deaths of children could have been prevented, but the hospital did not take any concrete steps in the matter
 lagbhag 9 maheene tak aspataal main anti-dipthiria vaxin nahin thi
 The Commission said that this is the result of the negligence of the officers of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and in the event a case of criminal negligence is made
 ayog ne kaha he ki is maamle main police ko aspataal or swasthya vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf aapraadhik laaparvaahee kii exiaar darj kerani chahie or maamle kii puri tarah jaanch kerani chahie

 Indian-origin South African model Shashi Naidu has adopted the motto of Mahatma Gandhi, in which he said that make yourself as you want to see the world

 Naidu topped the list of 100 sexiest women in the world in the appendix that was released in July of fhm's South African edition
 vah kahati hai ki gandhi ke vichaaron par amal ke liye vah jo bhi karti hai, pyaar, lagan or samarpan ke saath karti hai
 Naidu, who has dominated the pages of the magazine for nearly a decade, was inspired by his new title to innovate
 alushi model management company kii pramukh naidu ab chaahati hai ki vah baapu ke adarsh vaakya kaa istemaal company ke liye bhi karen
 When Naidu was told about his new title, he could not believe it
 unhone bataaya ki skool ke dinon main unka khubsuurati se koi sarokaar nahin tha, unke chehre par muhaanse the or daant bhi baahar nikle hue the lekin apni mehnat, lagan or samarpan se unhone model ke taur par khud ko sthapit kar liya
 The competition featured world-class celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, pop singer Christina Aguilera, but FHM editor Hejon Angler said Naidu deserved the title of the most sexy woman
 unhone kaha ki unamem vah sab kuch he jo ek purush kisi mahila ke andar chahta he
 Interestingly, Naidu's husband Mark Sandler is uninterested in her new title, despite being the dream of millions of men around the world
 naidu ke anusaar unhone kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki kisi ko unhen yah bataane kii jarurat he ki main kitni khubasurat hum
 He also admitted that it has become difficult to compete with girls of 18 years of age in his agency
 unhone kaha ki samay aa gaya he jab main khud ko viraam de duun, bahut ho gaya

 The Supreme Court dismissed the application against the judgment of a former judge of the Supreme Court, terming it dangerous for the judiciary
 court ne kaha ki is tarah kii yachikaaon se koi bhi jaj ke faisle ke khilaaf aakar khadaa ho jayega
 In fact, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan had filed an application saying that retired Supreme Court Justice CK Prasad, during his tenure, gave a wrong verdict to benefit the knowledgeable
 iske liye unhen naa keval press council of india ke chairman ke pad se hataaya jaae balki exiaar darj kar jaanch bhi karai jaae
 Arguing on behalf of Prashant Bhushan in the hearing on Friday, Shanti Bhushan said that action should be taken against Justice Prasad as it is tarnishing the image of the Supreme Court
 aise main supreme court ko apane hi ek purv jaj ko bachaana nahin chahie
 But during this time, Justice Deepak Mishra said that whether he is a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court, no such decision can be taken on any of his decisions
 saath hi unhone kaha ki is maamle main peedit paksh nahin aayaa he or kisi ajanabi kii yachika par sunwaayee nahin kii ja sakati
 In his judgment, Justice Mishra said that such petitions are dangerous for the judiciary and in such a situation one can stand against the judge
 agar kisi ko faisle par aapatti he to wo court main punarvichaar yaa phir curative patishan daakhil kar saktaa he
 Subsequently, this petition was dismissed
 gauratlab he ki is maamle main prashanth bhushan ne sibiai or sivisi ko bhi shikaayat di thi or baad main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi chitthee likhi thi

 Sandeep, the son of Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, said, "the way you are selling the country to the capitalists, you have become an agent of foreign companies

 In response, BJP said that Congress is doing politics of hate
 bijepi netaa nalin kohli ne kaha ki yah bayaan congress ke liye sharmnaak he or isse congress kii maansikta kaa pataa chalata he
 Sandeep Dixit has given controversial statements many times
 saal 2017 main unhone sena ko lekar coment kiya tha, jiske baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne unhen fatkaar lagaai thi
 Actually, Sandeep Dixit had given a disputed statement about the Army Chief, he described the Army Chief as a 'goonda of the road'

 chunaav ke thik pehle uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne obisi kii 17 jatiyon ko anusuchit jatiyon main karke apni taraf se jabardast chunavi card khelaa he
 But after this announcement, BSP chief Mayawati has termed this move of Akhilesh Yadav as a step in the eyes of the backward castes
 mayawati ne daawa kiya he ki ghoshnaa ke baad in 17 jatiyon ke logon ko naa to obisi shrenee main aarakshan mil paaegaa or naa hi anusuchit jatiyon ke cote kaa, unke mukhyamantri rahete hue 1995 main bhi aisi hi koshish kii thi
 As a result, the proposal to include these people in the Scheduled Castes was stuck with the Central Government and on the contrary, they were also denied OBC category reservation
 mayawati ne kaha ki jab vah dobaaraa mukhyamantri bani to in jatiyon ko phir se obisi shrenee main shaamil kiya tha taaki unhen kam se kam obisi shrenee main aarakshan mil sake
 Mayawati said that how the Samajwadi Party only wants to garner votes of these castes by including these castes in scheduled castes before the election
 mayawati ne aarope lagaaya samaajawaadee party ke shashan main sirf yadav jati kaa bhala hua he or baaki sabhi pichhadi jatiyon kii andekhi hui he jiskaa khamiyaja akhilesh yadav ko chunaav main chukaana padegaa
 In Uttar Pradesh elections, leaders have been doing such stunts at the right time of election
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress party ne isi tarah se musalamaanon ko aarakshan dene elaan kar diya tha
 This proposal later fell flat
 isi tarah se mayawati ne ek baar uttar pradesh ko chaar tukdon main baantne kaa prastaav paarit kar diya tha

 The bloody incident at Orlando Gay Club in the early hours of Sunday is being called the most gruesome incident of 'mass shooting' in the history of America
 jab nite club main jute logon kii masti charam par thi, umr matin apane haath main AR-15 liye club main ghusaa or dhuandhar 50 round se bhi zyada firing karata rahaa

 The statement was given in the public meeting that the president of AIMIM and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi had said in a public meeting that he would not raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai to the Sangh leaders

 The Constitution of India gives them the freedom not to raise any such slogan
