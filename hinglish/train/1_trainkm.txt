 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti kii pich par mahagathbandhan agar fail hua to iske peeche kii vajah vah game plan he jo pichley dedh saalon main bijepi ne bahut hi sadhe andaaj main banaaya
 The planning behind this victory took place at the BJP headquarters in Lucknow, which is also known as the bjp's control room
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main amit shah uttar pradesh ke prabharee or sunil bansal sah prabharee bane, tab se abtak party do loksabhaa or ek vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeet chuki he
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', Organization General Secretary Sunil Bansal said that we have connected our workers for the 2019 election to the three crore 35 lakh beneficiaries who got direct benefits of the Prime Minister's schemes, this work was like a Bhagiratha effort for us
 unhone bataaya ki 80 siton par 35 chehron ko badalakar bijepi ne naaraazgi roak lee
 Candidates were changed in many seats, while seats of many candidates were changed, which almost ended the case of resentment against the candidates
 sunil bansal ne bataaya ki chunaav ke 3 maheene pehle tak bijepi ne apane 16 hajaar kaaryakartaaon ko puure pradesh ke alag-alag cametiyon, nigamon, board or duusare sarkari sansthaaon main nominete kar diya, jisase kaaryakartaaon ke bich kii naaraazgi khatm hui or vah josh se kaam main jute gaye
 Prior to the election of the candidates, about half a dozen times the opinion was held from the district level to the state level several times and then the names of the candidates were announced
 unhone kaha ki march se lekar 17 may tak kul 697 sabhaayen huin jo pradhanmantri narendra modi, rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah, siem yogi adityanath or rajnath singh ke saath-saath sahyogi dalon ke netaaon or mantriyon kii sabhaayen thim
 Before the election started, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had prepared the atmosphere by holding 13 big meetings in Uttar Pradesh
 bansal ne kaha ki yah bahut pehle tay ho gaya tha ki hamen jati or dharm ke mahagathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke trep main nahin aana he or hamen jativiheen ladaai ke liye rashtrawaad or vikaswad kii pich taiyaar kerani he, kyonki agar ham jati or sameekaran kii baat karte to ham is gathbandhan ko nahin haraa sakate the, isliye hamen mahagathbandhan ko hamaari pich par laana tha or ham isamen kaamyaab rahe
 He said that the BJP knew that this time there is pro-incumbency in the name of PM Modi and there is no resentment against Yogi Adityanath, in such a way, to hurt the dynasty and corruption of the grand alliance, as well as weaponizing nationalism and the organization
 Banana, which the party did well
 sunil bansal ne baatcheet main bataaya ki ek baar ground work taiyaar hone ke baad 53 siton par ham mahagathbandhan se aage the or hamaari ladaai 27 siton par simat rahi thi jo behad hi kadi thi or jahaan jeetna bahut mushkil tha, lekin ground par modi lahar, logon main modi ko laane kii hasarat or kaaryakartaaon ke josh ne in 27 siton par bhi hamen ladaai main khadaa kiya or ham isamen 11 siten jeet gaye
 He said that the bjp's team of six people used to talk to each other everyday and give a feck back
 is team main siem yogi adityanath, prabharee jepi nadda, sanghathan mantri sunil bansal,up mukhyamantri keshav maury or dinesh sharma shaamil the
 The pm's schemes acted as master strokes, in which bright money, toilets, PM housing, indebtedness to farmers, money coming into farmers' account and law and order had a big role
 bijepi ke pravaktaa dow
 Chandramohan said that the instructions of the organization were the same as God's orders for BJP leaders and activists, which were accepted by all literally, only then we could win this big challenge
 bijepi ke in kaaryakramon or chunavi ranneeti kaa gathbandhan ke paas koi jabaab nahin tha

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has appealed to the central government to reduce the base price of petrol and diesel
 unka maananaa he ki base price ghatane se VAT apane aap ghat jayega or daam main kami aa jaaegi
 Nitish Kumar believes that the base price is higher in Bihar

 For this reason, he used to take it through all these things
 jiesti aane ke baad yah sab cheez bhi band ho gai he
 Nitish told the central government that by calculating the tax, our base price will also be reduced and we charge those who are on petrol or on diesel
 bihar kaa waite ek-do rajyon se chhodkar adhikansh rajyon se kam hi he, maatr 26 fisad petrol par or 19 fisad dijal par he
 Bihar is already the lowest VAT levying state
 agar base price ghat jayega to apane aap yahaan petrol-dijal kii keemat ghat jaaegi
 Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said that despite all these things, despite telling all the things, we will sit together and discuss and this time not once before there was a big increase in the price of petrol and diesel
 hamane apane rajya main us ko kam kiya tha
 For some time, we are going to consider all those things among ourselves, but we have urged the government to look at the base price once, because in Jharkhand it is 51 rupees, then how did we get 55 rupees

 lekin tamaam padtaal ke aadhaar par jab india today ne is kosh ke bare main sawaal uthaae to sabase adhik focus pan number par kiya jiske aadhaar par hi daankartaaon ko kar main chhot di jaati he or isamen milane vaali raashi iskar ke daayre se baahar hoti he
 While the arguments of the PMNRF are curtly justified, India Today first raised the question as to why the PAN card has been issued from the government category when the PMNRF describes itself as a private entity
 pan card kaa chauthaa shabd dharak kii shrenee ko ingit karata he
 Of course, there was no denial of this to the PMO, so the government changed the PAN number
 (pan card main antar ke liye dekhen box) is bare main india today ne soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon ke tahat pan card badalane kii vajah or usase sambandhit file notings muhaiyaa karaane kii maang kii to raahat kosh ne ek baar phir lucatipi kaa khel kiya
 The PMO argued in its reply that this question cannot be answered as it does not fall under the purview of Section 2 (f) of the RTI Act
 ab piemenaref ne pan card trust kii shrenee main jari karaayaa he, lekin yah gaiyr panjikrut trust he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether a non-registered trust can run through a PMO
 is sawaal ke jawaab main desh ke pratham mukhya soochna ayukta or pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke kaarykaal main bataur sanyukt sachiv is raahat kosh kii jimmedaari sambhaal chuke vajahat habibulla india today se kehete hai, ''yah to piemo ko bataanaa chahie
 But i had ruled as the Chief Information Commissioner that since this institution runs from the PMO and the Prime Minister is its chairman, it has to reply under the Right to Information Act
 '' lekin piemo kii ore se artiai ke sawaal ke jawaab main file notings or pan card badalane kii vajahon kaa khulaasa karne se inkaar ko ve galat tehraate hai
 He believes that even though the PMO has changed the PAN card, it has been brought under the category of trust and he should appoint a private employee instead of a government officer to oversee its functioning, but since the Prime Minister is the chairman of this relief fund, so He has to become accountable to the public
 artiai activist subhash agarwal pradhanmantri raahat kosh ko nae sire se gathit karne kii jarurat bataa rahe hai
 "the structure of PMNRF is wrong," he says
 yah pakistan se aae sharnaarthiyon ko basaane ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 Then in addition to the Prime Minister, Congress Party President, Tata Trustees etc
 were included in the Management Committee which is not relevant today
 '' india today ne artiai main yah bhi sawaal poocha tha ki agar piemenaref ek trust he to uske trustee koun-koun hai, uski puri jaankaree di jaae
 But the PMO gave a firm reply to this, check the website of the Prime Minister's Office in this regard
 lekin isaki website main kahin bhi trustee kaa koi zikr nahin he
 RTI activist and chartered accountant by profession Ajay Kumar Goel also raises the question, "if it is a trust, did Pandit Nehru make anyone its trustee next
" is sambandh main kya koi aupchaarik record he? trust ek khaas makasad se banaaya gaya tha, lekin baad main isamen bahut-si chijen iske daayre main jod di gayi
 While the trust is formed with a specific purpose, here everything has been changed like a home shop
 ''ve ek takneekee sawaal uthaate hai ki gambhir bimariyon ke ilaaj ke liye piemo unheen aspataalon ko sahaayta raashi jari karata he jo uske panel main he
 But TDS is not deducted from the amount released to the hospitals, which should be as per the Income Tax rule
 lekin artiai ke jawaab main piemo kii daleel he ki chunki vah tids nahin katata isliye use ten number kii jarurat hi nahin he
 This is the situation when there is a non-congress government in the country and the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi is emphasizing on transparency of governance
 lekin unka hi karyaalay us fund ko janata ke prati javabdeh nahin bana rahaa jo janata ke paise par hi chalata he
 The PMNRF website itself states that 2,069 in this fund till January 15 this year
 84 karod rupye shesh hai
 Certainly, there will be a game of hideousness about such a huge fund and there will be an attempt to avoid accountability and transparency under the guise of technical points
 is ashanka ke peeche bhi vajah he
 This fund also helps the poor for serious illnesses, but there is no proper criterion for giving assistance, so that there is always scope for favoritism
 haalanki centre kii satta main aane ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne raahat kosh main gujarat model ko lagu karne kii koshish kii
 In the review meeting on 19 July 2014, he emphasized that a comprehensive, scientific way and humanity should be grounded in helping the needy
 modi ne isamen gambhirtam bimariyon main merit ke aadhaar par praathamikta dene kii baat kahi
 But still the relief fund has been kept secret by the authorities
 purana pan nandhaaaghf0033mpena kaa chauthaa shabd uski shrenee bataata he
 That is, the PAN of the Relief Fund was in the Government category, India Today had questioned
 nayaa pan nandhaachhthf4637qaba pradhanmantri karyaalay ne gaiyr panjikrut trust ke rup main pan liya he
 But refused to give the file notings
 kya kabhi koi khilaadi aatmghaatee gol dagkar raahat mahasoos kar saktaa he! lekin fifa world cap main brazil ke dephender marcelo udghaatan match main kroeshia ke liye gol dagkar raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Marcello may not have thought of such a start by scoring a suicide goal for his team but by doing so in the opening match of the World Cup, his eyes were wide open
 marcelo ko khud par hi bharosa nahin hua ki unase aisa ho gaya he jis gol se kroeshia ko 1-0 se badhat mil gai thi
 He said, 'it is very sad

 If you start talking about India's politics after the year 2000, it cannot be completed without the name of Narendra Modi
 aaj ham pradhanmantri modi nahin, bijepi kaaryakarta or sangh ke swanyasevak narendra modi ke bare main bataaenge
 Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat, but Modi's social life began in June 1975
 desh main pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne immergency laga di thi or kai bade netaaon ko jail main thuns diya gaya tha
 During this time Modi was appointed as the General Secretary of Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti, run by the support of RSS
 kuch samay baad aresas par bhi pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Modi went underground to avoid arrest
 narendra modi dilli aa gaye or centre sarkaar ke faisle ko chunauti dene ke liye ranneeti banane lage
 During this time he printed leaflets against the decision of the government
 immergency khatm hui or modi aresas ke prachaarak ban gaye
 He worked day and night to expand the Sangh's branches in Surat and Vadodara
 saal 1979 main unhen aresas ke kaam ke liye dilli bula liya gaya
 Now Narendra Modi had become an active volunteer of the Sangh, he was given the responsibility of writing articles on research and emergency in Delhi

 In 2001, there was an earthquake in Gujarat and in view of public displeasure with the government, the BJP high command decided to hand over the command of the state to Narendra Modi
 7 oktober 2001 ko narendra modi ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri kii shapath lee
 The year 2002 is always remembered by the politicians of India because this year the Gujarat riots took place with Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister

 While independent agencies said 2000 people were killed in these riots
 dangon ke bich narendra modi ko khud ko sabit karnaa tha kyonki rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hone the
 Modi had offered his resignation at a BJP national executive meeting held in Goa, which the party refused to accept
 modi ke netritv main party ne disambar 2002 main chunaav ladaa or 182 main se 127 siten bijepi ko milin
 Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Chief Minister, but the BJP suffered defeat in the 2004 general elections and Atal Bihari Vajpayee blamed the Gujarat riots for the defeat

 No one could believe that Naveen left him like this
 police ne jab naveen ke kaatilon kii talash shuru kii to unki talash do ladakon par jaakar puri hui
 According to the police investigation, Naveen was stabbed to death by two boys named Vikas and Kamran
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki aropiyon vikaas or kamran kii naveen se koi jaan pahchaan yaa dushmani nahin thi
 Rather both accused are victims of drug addiction

 Despite this, he caught the murderer within two days
 asal main police ne jab cese kii jaanch shuru kii to unhen pataa laga ki jis jagah par katl hua he, vahaan do nashedi lutpaat karte hai
 Just because of this, the police caught Vikas and Kamran
 jab poochtacha kii gai to donon ne apana jurm kabool kar liya

 There has been a rapid increase in the number of mobile towers above the houses in Delhi, in which many rules have been put on hold

 Meaning 2 mobile towers are illegal in every 3 mobile towers, in which government permission is not taken
 or shaayad south dilli municipal karporation (SDMC) ko ye mobile tower najar bhi nahin aa rahe he jo in sabko regulate karti he
 What does the report say? According to the report, there are 3,377 mobile towers in South Delhi, out of which 2,245 are talking through the air without any government permission
 in avaidh mobile toweron main sirf 40 mobile toweron ko hi SDMC ne ab tak hataaya he

 There are about 3,400 mobile towers in South Delhi and surveys are also being done on how many towers were erected in the last months
 jitne bhi tower niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hue paae jaayenge unako pehle notice bheja jaayegaa phir bhi agar wo tower nahin hataate hai to nagarpalika unakon sil kar degi

 com / 4ezrlfogcq In hearing the case, the court had expressed its displeasure with the Delhi government that the documents of a meeting held at the Delhi Secretariat on 15 January 2014 indicated that there was support for the depot emptying and now the government is saying the opposite
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki master plan ke mutabik, ye ilaaka baadh kshetra he, isamen depo nahin bana sakate
 When the DTC has come to the Supreme Court in this case, why has the Delhi government applied
 ? court ne kaha tha ki dilli main ek jagah hi bas depo ke liye 500 acre jameen nahin di ja sakati or naa hi supreme court gum-ghumkar jaanch kar saktaa ki kahaan cese chal rahaa he

 jab ditisi is maamle main supreme court ai he to dilli sarkaar ne arji kyon di he
 The The court had said that 500 acres of land cannot be given for a bus depot in a single place in Delhi and neither can the Supreme Court rotate and investigate where the case is going on
 tippaniyan Please tell that during the Commonwealth Games in 2010, temporary construction of this depot was allowed to erect buses
 bataa den ki saal 2010 main hue rashtramandal khelon ke dauraan bason ko khadaa karne ke liye is depo ke asthai nirmaan kii anumati di gai thi

 Aaj Tak has tried to bring the pain of those people through Operation Griha Pravesh
 jo bilders kii manamaani ke shikaar hue hai
 Despite paying a hefty amount, the people who take homes in Amrapali Housing in Noida and Greater Noida are feeling cheated
 ajtak bana he aise hi pareshaan or maayoos logon kii aawaaj or builder ke jhooth ko benakaab kiya he
 If someone is waiting for home entry for 7 years, then for 6 years someone is going around the house in the builder's office
 lekin builder barason se grahako kii ankhon main dhul jhonk rahe hai
 In 2009 and 2010, Amrapali Group had launched a series of projects in Noida and Greater Noida
 isi daur main amrapali ne dhoni ko apana brands ambesder banaaya
 Sold the dream of luxury homes and showed Dhoni's dream of becoming a neighbor
 lekin ye vaade ye daawey sab jhuthe sabit hue
 Those who rely on Amrapali now feel cheated
 barason se hataash graahak ab aakrosh main hai
 On one side the dream was scattered, on the other side, the builders circled while doing the job
 kirayedar se makaan maalik banane kaa sapana to tut hi gaya saath hi ghar chalaanaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Every month the landlord was already compelled to pay the rent, as well as the double pressure of EMI is now forcing people to drink tears of blood
 is dhokhe se graahak naaraaz hai, pareshaan hai, maayoos hai lekin laachaar bhi hai
 The helpless house for which everything was at stake has not been found so far
 epady, sona, jamaapunji sab makaan ke naam kar diya or to or bank se karj lekar develapalar ko sara paisa chukaa diya
 But still this wait of the house is not taking the name of ending
 ghar kaa bajet is karj ke saamne ghutane tech chukaa he
 The world class Aashiyane's dream entry made with animation is one of the few realizations of life
 is pal kii khushi ko shabdon main bayaan karnaa shaayad mumkin he bhi nahin
 To capitalize on this feeling, the builders sell the dream of the house and after playing with the emotions of the people take huge amount out of their pocket
 ghar book karaate vakt anemation dikhaakar ek world class ashiyane kaa sapana dikhaaya jaataa he
 This glass house woven in thoughts starts to break as soon as it is near the date of possession and as soon as the possession is found, the joy of entering the house in that flat is extinguished within a few minutes
 barason tak pojeshan ke liye tarasaane ke baad amrapali ne safaire or platinum main ghar dena shuru to kiya he lekin ye ghar kaaphi khastahal hai
 The registry of the house did not happen, the buyers alleged that the house was given to them in a hurry, but the flaws of the flats are not hidden from the people living here
 fire sefti ke upkaran lage zarur hai lekin wo pani kii pipeline se jude nahin hai or naa hi unke sensors kaam kar rahe he
 Whatever the shortcomings of facilities are as low as mentioned, but the people living in these projects of Amrapali have not yet got the chance to become landlords
 ghar kii registry ke liye builder ko athurity se campilashan certificate yani sisi hasil karnaa hota he or sisi athurity tab detii he jab builder kaam puraa kar detaa he
 It is clear that even in government papers, the work of the builder is incomplete
 jhuthe sabit hue kai vaadekam puraa hone ke baad bhi sisi milanaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin hoga kyonki amrapali group ke alag alag projects par ek artiai ke mutabik athurity kaa 450 karod rupye bakaayaa he
 That is, till now the developer has not paid the authority for the entire amount of land

 com / svjvwlzkqj — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) January 7, 2018 This song is from Kundan Shah's film Kabhi Ya Kabhi Naa, starring Suchitra Krishnamurthy, Deepak Tijori and Naseeruddin Shah with Shah Rukh
 is gane kaa sangeet jatin-lalit ne diya tha or isaki liriks mashhoor shaayar mazaruh sultanpuri ne likhi thi
 Rajpal Yadav told Shahrukh, at the beginning of the joke of such a blown 'zero' on Twitter, Shah Rukh has presented the new look of his next film Zero in front of everyone
 unka luk khub surkhiyaan bator rahaa he
 Anand l Rai's film also stars Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma
 bisisiai ke purv adhyaksh or isisi ke purv chairman en shrinivasana kii pari kaa cricket prashasan se ant hone ja rahaa he
 In fact, the 7 member committee of BCCI has accepted the recommendation of Lodha Committee, in which a person who is more than 70 years of age cannot become an official of BCCI or State Board
 en shrinivasana 72 varsh ke ho chuke hai, jiske baad ab wo bisisiai yaa kisi bhi rajya cricket board main prashaasak ke pad ke kiye ayogy ho gaye hai
 However, the BCCI objected to the condition of the Lodha Committee in which they suggested that any state would have only one union and the state could vote only one
 agar kisi bhi rajya main ek se adhik cricket sangh he to wo roteshan ke tahat vot degaa
 Under this condition, voting will be rotational in gujarat-maharashtra, Gujarat and Maharashtra have 3–3 cricket associations, all other states have one cricket association
 iske alaava lodha samiti ne yah siforishein bhi di thi ki bisisiai kii 14 sadasyon vaali kaaryakarini cameti kii jagah 9 sadasyon vaali parishad banaai jaae
 What is the Lodha Committee and what is the demand for it: The Supreme Court formed the Lodha Committee during the IPL in 2013 to investigate the spot-fixing and betting case
 lodha cameti ne bhartiya cricket or uske prashasan ko behatar banane ke kuch siforishein bisisiai ke saamne rakhi thi
 Which was opposed by the BCCI
 supreme court ne baad main bisisiai ko yah aadesh maanane ke aadesh diya
 Let us know what the Lodha Committee had demanded for the betterment of cricket
 1
 In the first recommendation of the committee, no person can become a BCCI or state association officer after the age of 70 years
 2
 The most important suggestion of the Lodha Committee is that one state association will have one vote and the other will be relegated as associate member 
 3
 There should be separate governing councils for IPL and BCCI
 iske alaava samiti ne ipel gavarning council ko simit adhikaar die jane kaa bhi suzav diya he
 4
 samiti ne bisisiai padaadhikariyon ke chayan ke liye maanakon kaa bhi suzav diya
 They say that they should not be ministers or government officials, and should not have held any post of BCCI for nine years or three terms
 6
 The Lodha Committee also suggests that no official of the BCCI should be given more than two consecutive terms
 7
 The Lodha Committee report also proposed the formation and establishment of the Players' Association
 8
 The committee suggests that the BCCI should be brought under the purview of the Right to Information Act (RTI)
 9
 According to the committee, BCCI cricket related matters should be settled by the former players, while decisions on non-cricket issues will be made by the CEO with the help of six assistant managers and two committees

 Along with this, Shankaracharya has appealed to the saints and Rambhaktas that those who have left their homes for this campaign and reached Prayag or other places should return to their homes after taking Sangam bath

 bharat ne kaha ki yah ‘gambhir or sthaayee chintaa kaa maamla’ he
 India expressed its concern to the US State Department on Monday after the US approach was exposed
 bharat ne jor dekar kaha ki yah nahin ho saktaa ki koi sanghathan, rajya yaa rajettar sanghathan aatankwaad ko pryojit kare or chhot kaa laabh uthaae
 The comments america faisle par pratikriya vyakt karte hue videsh mantralay ke aadhikarik pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘hamane is baat par dhyaan diya he ki america videsh mantralay ne ek america adaalat main yah ruukh apanaaya he ki pakistan kii iesai ko 26 november 2008 ke mumbai aatankwaadi hamale main divaani mukademe se chhot di jaaegi

 It cannot be that any organization sponsoring terrorism, state or non-state organizations avails exemption
 pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘hamane apni sthiti ke bare main america ko lagaataar avgat karaayaa he
 '' bharat ne america drushtikon ujagar hone ke baad somvaar ko america videsh vibhaag se apni chintaa jataai thi

 Will be exempt from civil litigation
 ’’ He said that it is very important for India that justice should be done and without considering the jurisdiction of where he lives or where he conducts his activities, the perpetrators of this attack and his patrons brought justice to justice
 Go yah nahin ho saktaa he ki aatankwaad ko pryojit karne vaala koi sanghathan, rajya yaa rajettar sanghathan chhot kaa laabh uthaae

 ’’ Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party and Modi government fiercely and accused the Mandsaur rally
 der shaam main bijepi ke diggaj netaa arun jetali ne fasebuk ke jariye rahul gandhi ke ek-ek aarope kaa jawaab diya or unhen niraadhaar bataaya
 Let us know that Arun Jaitley has recently returned home from the hospital
 arun jetali ne buudhvaar ko rahul gandhi par madhyapradesh main ek raily main 'puri tarah galat' tippanee karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki kisi bhi udyogpati ke karj kaa ek rupaya bhi maaf nahin kiya gaya he
 Arun Jaitley responded to the allegations one by one
 1
 Rahul's charge - Modi government 2 of 15 industrialists
 5 lakh karod rupye kaa karj maaf kiya
 Jaitley's answer - This fact of the Congress president is factually completely wrong
 modi sarkaar ne udyogpatiyon kaa ek rupee kaa bhi karj maaf nahin kiya he
 Those owed by banks and other financial institutions were declared insolvent and evicted from their company through IBC
 is kanoon ko modi sarkaar ne lagu kiya
 Most of these loans were given during the UPA regime
 2
 Rahul's accusation - now all made in China, we will make made in Mandsourgetzli's answer - When UPA was the government, there were only 2 companies in the country to make mobiles, and today there are more than 120 companies
 3
 Rahul's charge - PM Modi gave Rs 35–35 thousand crore to two diamond traders, who now left the country
 jetali kaa jawaab -yah tathyaatmak rup se galat he
 Bank fraud started in 2011
 us samay upie kaa shashan tha
 This fraud was detected after the arrival of the NDA government
 'aakhir kitna jaanate hai rahul, kab janenge'jetali ne party kii website par 'vah kitna jaanate hai' sheershak vaale ek lekh main sawaal kiya he ki kya gandhi ko aparyaapt jaankaree da ja rahi he, yaa vah apane tathyon ke saath bahut udaar hai
 Jaitley said, "whenever i hear the thoughts of Rahul Gandhi, whether it is inside Parliament or outside
 main khud se baar-baar yahi poochta hum - vah kitna jaanate hai? vah kab janenge? madhya pradesh main die gaye unke bhaashan ko sunakar aaj ek baar phir is prashn kaa jawaab jaanane kii jigyaasa hui
 "jaitley said," The government has not waived even a single rupee owed to any industrialist
 jinhone karj nahin lautaaya he, unhen diwalia ghoshit kiya ja rahaa he or ibisi (diwaala or diwaliyapan samhita) ke jariye unhen unki companiyon se hataa diya gaya he, jise pradhanmantri modi kii sarkaar ne lagu kiya he
 " dilli police ne sunanda pushkar kii maut kaa raaj khol diya he
 According to police, Sunanda died of poisoning
 is baat kaa khulaasa ames se final report milane ke baad hua he
 Which was the poison, it is not clear yet
 lekin 2014 main sudhir gupta ne polonium 210 jaisaa jehar hone kii sambhaavna jataai thi
 The FBI has stamped the AIIMS postmortem report in its report
 yah report 2014 main dow
 Sudhir Gupta
 epabiai ne bhi apni jaanch report main kaha ki sunanda kii maut jehar se hui thi
 The AIIMS Medical Board has submitted its final report on the death of Sunanda Pushkar to the Delhi Police
 isse pehle board ne epabiai kii forensik report kaa gahan avlokan kiya he
 The FBI had investigated Viscera after Sunanda Pushkar's murder, his viscera was sent to the US agency FBI for investigation
 epabiai ne visra kii jaanch report nau maheene baad dilli police ko saunp di thi
 But AIIMS was asked to give its opinion on the FBI report
 ames ne banaaya tha bordais kaam ke liye ames main doctoron kaa ek board gathit kiya gaya tha
 The board was required to review the forensic report of the FBI and submit a final report
 shuukravaar ko ames kii taraf se dilli police ko report saunp di gai
 This is the final report on this matter
 tharur se ho sakati he poochhatabais maamle kii jaanch ke liye gathit es

 Sources believe that soon Sunanda Pushkar's husband Congress leader Shashi Tharoor may be questioned in this case
 khulegaa sunanda kii maut kaa rajmaamle se jude sheersh sutron kaa kahana he ki is report kaa kaaphi mahatv he
 If this report of AIIMS is conclusive, it will help to reach the conclusion of this massacre
 darasal, is maamle main isse pehle kuch chijen uplabdh nahin thi
 Because of which this investigation was being interrupted
 lashkar-e-taiyaba ne rachi he ek ghaatak saazish
 According to intelligence agencies, Lashkar is preparing to open a training camp of terror on Andaman and Nicobar islands
 agar sidhaa sidhaa samajha jaae to lashkar hindustan kii sarhadon main ghusane kii puri taiyaar kar chukaa he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs also does not want to take this nefarious plan of Lashkar lightly
 grih mantralay ne andaman nicobar main alert jari kar diya he
 Another name for terror in the world of terror is lashkar-e-taiba
 lashkar ke aatanki kisi bhi kufnaak aatanki ghatana ko anjaam dene ke liye kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 The number of terror attacks that have taken place in India so far, the name of Lashkar is mostly associated with us
 or ab lashkar ek or ghaatak saazish ko anjaam dene kii taiyaari main laga hua he
 lashkar-e-taiba leaders are staring at India with horror
 khabar he ki aatanki sanghathan lashkar andaman or nicobar dweep par apana garh banane kii soch rahaa he
 It is being said that Lashkar wants to use Andaman and Nicobar as a land of terror
 khufia sutron kii maane to bharat kii had main aane vaale is behad khoobsut dweep ko aatanki apane kabze main lenaa chaahate hai
 Not only this, Lashkar also has a bad eye on Maldives
 aatankiyon ke napak mansoobon kii khabar grahamantralay ko bhi lag chuki he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a directive to the administration there to remain alert
 grih mantralay ne prashasan ko ye sakht hidaayat di he ki wo andaman or nikaabar ke har naagarik kaa pahchaan patr jari kare
 Also, the duration of this has been kept by the Ministry of Home Affairs
 zaahir he khatara bahut bada he or suraksha agenciyon se lekar sarkaar tak ise halke main nahin lenaa chaahati he
 Because the world is aware of Lashkar's blood
 uske aatank kii dastaan itani kufnaak he ki usamen tabaahi ke alaava kisi or kaa zikr nahin aata he
 After the Mumbai attack, it was heard that Pakistan had taken action on Lashkar's training camps in Muzaffarabad
 khufia agenciyo kii report ye bhi thi iesai ne bangladesh main lashkar camp lagava die hai or vahiin par chal rahi he aatank kii training
 But after these reports, the government and security agencies have lost sleep that Lashkar is also eyeing Andaman, Nicobar and Maldives
 aatankwaadi sanghathan nae adde kii talash main hai, ek aisa adda jo surakshit bhi ho or logon kii najaron se dur bhi
 Andaman Nicobar is therefore on his target
 andaman main aatank ke adde banane ke phaayde or bhi hai
 There are a total of 572 small and large islands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands group, out of which only 38 islands are inhabited
 baaki ke 534 dweep ekadam nirjan hai auki inamen se kai dwipon kii bich kii duuri bhi bahut zyada he auki dehshatgardon ke liye isse mufeed auki kya ho saktaa he
 Obviously if the terrorists somehow manage to infiltrate these uninhabited islands of Andaman and Nicobar then it will be easy for them to prepare their bases of terror there
 andaman auki nicobar dweep samuh ke zyaadaatar dweep behad ghaney jangalon se ghire hai or aatankwaadiyon ke liye yahaan chhip kar rahanaa mushkil nahin hoga
 The way Lashkar used the sea route for the Mumbai attack has proved that the sea is no longer a place for terrorist organizations which is out of their reach
 chhipakar samudri raaston kaa istemaal karnaa bhi wo bakhubi sikh gaye hai or andaman nicobar ke nirjan dwipon main ghuspaith karnaa unke liye koi badi chunauti nahin he
 Then most of the terrorist training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan have come in the eyes of America and the pressure is mounting on the terror organizations to find a new place
 jaahir he aatankwaadi aisi jagah kii talash main hai jahaan wo sirf suraksha agenciyon kii najar se hi nahin batch kar rah saken balki kisi ko unke vahaan hone kaa shaq bhi nahin ho
 The Andaman and Nicobar Islands group fit perfectly in their nefarious plot
 itnaa hi nahin andaman nicobar ke dweep bharat kii suraksha ke lihaaj se bhi behad ahm hai or aatankiyon kii sajeesh in dwipon par maujuud raksha ke mahatvapurn thikaanon ko nishaanaa banane kii bhi ho sakati he
 Obviously, the Indian security agencies need to be very vigilant to thwart the changing tactics of terrorists

 'uddhav thakare ke mutabik shivasena chaahati he ki desh ram mandir par jitani jaldi ho sake faisla le

 sensor ne paanch modification ke saath film ko u / a certificate diya he
 Films with this certificate are not allowed to be viewed by minors alone
 yah desh kii pehali aisi hindi film hogi jo IMAX 3D hindi main relies hogi
 Film Name: Brothers Director: Karan Malhotra Star Cast: Akshay Kumar, Siddharth Malhotra, Jacqueline Fernandes, Jackie Shroff Duration: 158 Minutes Certificate: u / a Rating: 2 Stardirector Karan Malhotra who served as Assistant Director in 'jodha Akbar' and 'my Name Is Khan'
 And remake his first film 'agneepath' which was well received by the audience
 ab ek or oficial rimek lekar karan malhotra aa rahe hai, hollywood kii mashhoor film 'warrior' kii oficial hindi rimek'bros'
 Not knowing the fight between brothers, many films have been made in the past and even though Karan has revealed his talent from his first film, but will his magic feed the audience this time too? Let us review the film
 kahaneeyah mumbai ke ek parivaar ke do bhaaiyondavid furnandis (akshay kumaar)or monti furnandis (siddharth malhotra) kii kahani he
 In childhood, Mamaria (shefali Shah) is possessed by her head for some reason and father Gary Fernandes (jackie Shroff) has to go to jail
 donon bhaaiyon kii parvarish alag alag tarah se hoti he or jab tak pita gairi jail se baahar aata he, tab tak david ne jeni (jacleen furnandis) se shaadi karke apana ghar alag basaa liya hota he, or monti alag hi guzar basar karata he
 Gary is already a wrestler and has been teaching Wrestling to David since childhood
 phir mumbai main mix marshall art (meme) kii pratiyogita hoti he or ring main aamane saamne donon bhai aate hai or phir kya hota he, ise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Being a remake of script, acting, music, official film, the script is similar to the English film 'warrior', but the Indian version of the film has tried hard to fill the emotion, which has failed
 film main jajbaton ko bhi dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he lekin wo jajbaat itane ruk ruk ke aate hai kii tab tak aap bor hone lagate hai
 The first half is quite slow, and the latter part of the film is much faster
 lekin clymex aane tak aap harek baat kaa andaja laga lete hai
 Sometimes actors act to be emotional, but you are so bored in that emotion that you laugh
 karan malhotra kii ye kriti kaaphi kamjor si lagati he
 An attempt has been made to serve a bundle of compulsions and sentiments but it has not been able to be justified
 vaise tofils ke satellitapahale se hi bik chuke hai to kamai to jarur kar legi lekin film ko jo sammaan milanaa chahie vah usase achhuti rah jaaegi
 In acting, Akshay Kumar has done a great job in the role of elder brother and the role of a father is played by Jackie Shroff
 jaiki shroff kaa ek ek bhav aapako unki acting kaa kaayal bana detaa he
 On the other hand, Shefali Shah as a mother and Ashutosh Rana's acting in the role of 'pasha' is a compliment
 film main siddharth malhotra apane comfort jone se baahar nikalakar thodaa alag role karne kii koshish kiye hai jo kii saraahneey he
 Siddharth Malhotra and Akshay Kumar's preparations for their respective characters are seen on screen
 bas script thodi or majboot hoti to yah film or bhi zyada dilachasp lagati
 Jacqueline Fernandes did not have much to do in the film, but her performance seems to be just right
 film kaa sangeet thik he, kyonki sonu nigam kaa gaay hua geet 'sapana jahaan' to akshay kii shaadi or beti hone kii baat ko darsha detaa he lekin karina kapur khan ke geet 'mairi' kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi, is geet ke aate hi film kii raftaar ruk si jaati he
 Why watch this movie if you are a fan of Akshay Kumar, Siddharth Malhotraya Jacqueline and Jackie Shroff
 kyon naa dekhegar aapako jajbaton kii samaj he, paariwarik prem se ittefaq rakhte hai to aapako ye film kaaphi kamjor mahasoos hogi
 And better, we can wait till it comes on TV

 ' Arvind Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party has been sitting on a fast since Saturday

 Kejriwal's party is appealing to the people of Delhi to stop paying electricity and water bills
 kejariwal kii najar saal ke ant main hone vaale dilli vidhansabha chunaavon par he
 This time the fast is not going on Ramlila Maidan or Jantar Mantar in an anonymous street in Sundernagri
 kejariwal kii party dilli ke logon se apil kar rahi he ki bijli or pani kaa bill bharna band kar den
 Kejriwal is eyeing the Delhi Assembly elections to be held at the end of the year

 Narendra Modi alleged that the CBI is being misused and that the terrorist organization Indian Mujahideen has been left open to take political revenge with them and save the fort of the Congress because the party believes that it will use them and BJP in democratic ways Can not stop
 modi ne ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ‘mujhe lagata he ki agle chunaav main sapa, basapa or congress kii tikdi chunaav ke maidan main nahin aegi
 In the next election, i think that the CBI, IM, these people will take care of the election front so that they can save the Congress front
 ’ bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pratyaashee ne aarope lagaaya ki unke virdohi kaayron kii tarah peeche se hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Modi challenged him to fight democratically
 modi ne kaha ki ek ke baad ek jis tarah kii ghatnaayen ho rahi hai, aisa lagata he ki jo log modi ko gujarat main parrast nahin kar paae or jinhen lagata he ki loktantric tareeke se to bhaajapa or modi ko ab roka nahin ja saktaa, unhone duusare taur-tareeke apanaae hai
 Sometimes put the CBI behind, sometimes give the Indian Mujahideen a free hand
 ’ modi ne iem kaa ullekh 27 oktober ko unki patna raily ke dauraan hue silsilewar dhamaakon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya jisamen saat log maare gaye or kai ghayal ho gaye
 IM is believed to be the suspect behind these attacks
 bhaajapa kaa aarope rahaa he ki kendra modi ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaane main shithilataa barat rahaa he
 Modi said as a warning, 'open your ears to politics with the help of bombs, guns and pistols, we are the second soil yields
 na ham aatankwaadiyon se jhuke hai, na jhukne vaale hai
 We will keep the terrorists hooked, clean them from the root
 ’ Modi jokingly said that the weather is changing from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
 jo log satta ke nashe main duube hue hai, unke liye satta ek mouj kaa saadhan ban gaya
 They have used the power for their happiness and comfort
 aise sab logon ko baari sankat kaa ehsaas ho gaya he
 We are facing so much opposition that their power is going to go
 aane vaale chunaavon main unki paraajay nishchit he
 They know that if the BJP government is formed in Delhi, then they know where will be the location of those who destroy this country
 is desh ko tabah karne kaa adhikaar kisi ko nahin diya jayega
 Modi said, the way vote bank politics is being done, for this i want to ask those leaders of UP what is the reason why you have jailed our two mlas for vote bank politics
 vot bank kii raajnneeti ke kaaran ye log gunaahagaaron ko jail main band nahin karte
 Keeping his sharp stance, Modi said, "those who could not defeat Modi in Gujarat, had to face defeat in three elections, who could not save their honor, who feel that the BJP cannot be stopped in a democratic way
" Probably, they have adopted other methods
 kabhi sibiai ko peeche laga do, kabhi indian mujahidin ko chhot de do
 
 
 
 to kaan kholkar sun len, ki ham duusari mitti kii paidaaish he, ham aatankwaadiyon se jhukne vaale nahin he
 We will keep terrorism clean
 modi ne kaha, himmat he to loktatrik tareeke se muqabla karo, janata ke bich jaao peeche se waar kyon karte ho
 India is playing with democracy
 hamaare bihar ke bhai-bahan chhath puja manaate hai, lekin usee chhath puja se pehle aatankwaadiyon ne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 This was the crime of those people that they used to speak Bharat Maa Ki Jai
 kya loktantr main hinsa ko jagah hoti he, bandook kii raajnneeti ko jagah hoti he, loktantr main harek ko apni aawaaj uthaane kaa adhikaar hota he
 But democracy is under attack in this country
 modi ne centre sarkaar par hamalaa jari rakhte hue kaha, soochna mantralay ne ek adwijuri jari kii he ki pradhanmantri lalakile se bhaashan kar rahe the, to media waalon ne narendra modi ko live kyon dikhaaya
 These people are ordering today on the August 15 incident
 unhen pradhanmantri kii garima kii chintaa nahin he
 He was concerned that on October 27, Modi was giving 'shahzade' speeches in Patna and in Delhi, but Modi was also seen on TV and he was also listening
 isse congress baukhala gai
 Modi said that whether the emperor of Delhi wants to appear or not on the TV screen, but has made a place in the hearts of the people of India
 60 saal main koi badlaav aayaa he? modi ne sawaal kiya ki 60 saal main congress ne kya diya
 The public has repeatedly sent them, they did something for your good
 
 
 bahut ho chukaa ab unke jane kaa vakt aa chukaa he
 Modi said that Uttar Pradesh gave many Prime Ministers in these 60 years, but the state did not develop
 akelaa upi kaa hi vikaas kiya hota, to desh apane aap aage bad chukaa he
 He is only interested in vote bank politics
 unhen or kisi kaam main ruchi nahin he
 He said that 24 hours of electricity is available in the villages of Gujarat as well, but electricity is a news in UP
 yahaan insaan intjaar kar rahaa he ki bijli kab aegi
 Attacking Akhilesh and Azam Khan, he said that only these two areas get electricity, not the rest in UP
 shaasha vah hota he, jo pehle janata ko detaa he, phir bache to khud ke liye istemaal karata he
 UP asked for lion from us, i wish they asked for electricity from us, they asked for cow of Gir, they asked us for understanding of dairy network like Amul, but did not ask for it
 iske liye samaj chahie ki janata ke hiton ke liye kya hona chahie
 Competition is going on in UP, who is the most criminal group, corruption is going on, they are not interested in solving your problems
 modi ne kaha, sapa-basapa donon dilli kii sarkaar ko bachaa rahe hai
 They know that Delhi's government cannot run without their support
 inke paas itani takat he ki dilli kii sarkaar ko jhukaa sakate hai
 They may meet railway demands, airport demands, employment demands for Bahraich, but they did not ask for it
 sapa or basapa itnaa samarthan ke baavjood bhi kuch nahin maang rahe hai, bengal ke liye mamata didi dilli sarkaar se ladati hai, ye sibiai se chhutkaaraa maangate hai
 They are asking for their rescue, not for the betterment of the state
 samaajawaadee party par apana hamalaa jari rakhte hue modi ne kaha ki hindustan ke mahaan kalakaar (unka ishaara amitabh bachchan kii ore tha) kaa prayog unhone 'upi main he dam
 
 
 
 ' ke liye kiya or usee mahaan kalakaar kaa prayog hamane gujarat paryaton ke liye kiya
 We know the correct use of the person
 madhya pradesh kii bhi bimaaru rajya main ginati hoti he, vahaan kii janata ne bijepi ko mauka diya or mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne vahaan kisaanon tak sinchai kaa pani pahunchaaya he
 Shivraj revolutionized the agriculture sector, more than electricity was produced in 50 years, more than he made in 10 years

 sansad kaa monsutra satr agle hafte 18 july se shuru ho rahaa he
 The biggest question that arises about this session is whether a motion of no confidence can be brought against the Modi government? In the last budget session, notice of no-confidence motion was given several times by various opposition parties, but even once this proposal could not be placed in the House
 is satr main agar hangaamaa thama or vipakshi dalon ne ekajutata dikhaai to avishvaas prastaav laakar is par bahes or voting karai ja sakati he
 The TDP and Congress have indicated that she can bring the proposal to the House during the session
 andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja na dene se naaraaz tidipi or wiesar congress nebajet satramen kai baar yah prastaav laane kii koshish kii thi
 Apart from this, many opposition parties including Congress, TRS, NCP have tried unsuccessfully to bring a no confidence motion in the last session
 tidipub bhi naarazbajet satr ke duusare hisse main tidipi ne jor-shor se andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang uthaai thi
 This was the reason that the Rajya Sabha was able to function for only 45 hours while 124 hours were uprooted
 is baar bhi tidipi apni maangon ko uthaane ke liye taiyaar he
 TDP leader in Rajya Sabha Y

 Chaudhary said that our demands are not fulfilled yet, there is no question of sitting silent in such a situation
 unhone kaha ki beete bajet satr kii tarah is satr main bhi ham apni maangon ko uthaaenge
 When Chaudhary was asked whether this time also TDP will bring a no confidence motion against the government in Parliament? On this, he said that in parliamentary democracy, the opposition parties have the right to register their protest in any form, we can again bring a motion of no confidence
 congress ne kasi kamarcongress kii ore se bhi monsutra satr main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane ke sanket die gaye hai
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that there are several issues on which a decision can be taken collectively
 singhvi ne kaha ki sarkaar ko kis tarah gherenge, yah abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, lekin ham janhit se jude kai muddon par sarkaar ko kinare karne ko taiyaar hai
 Singhvi said that there are many issues related to Jammu and Kashmir, weak economy, unemployment, farmers, corruption on which the government will have to answer in Parliament
 isliye sarkaar ko in sabhi muddon par avishvaas prastaav ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie, lekin yah ek samuhik faisla hoga
 Procedure for bringing the motion: In the Parliament, whichever party wants to bring a no-confidence motion, first it has to give written information to the speaker
 iske baad spikar us dal ke kisi saansad se ise pesh karne ke liye kehete hai
 But it is accepted only when the proposal has the support of at least 50 mps
 sadan main isapar charchaa ho sakati he or phir voting karai ja sakati he yaa samarthan karne vaale saansadon ko khadaa kar unki ginati kii ja sakati he
 Usually this proposal is brought with the motive of toppling the government when a government comes in a minority
 lekin iskaa istemaal sarkaron ko gherne or chetavanee swaroop bhi kiya jane laga he
 There have been many proposals in the past when the government had sufficient figures and there was no threat to it

 Everyone was shocked, how upset it was! The cruel hands of destiny Kalam were also very happy, like a really bad dream, they were shocked, everyone was awake, seeing something went away like this, they could not believe it was a dream or indeed their departure

 This picture of Kareena Kapoor Khan eating corn bread and mustard greens has been shared by her nutritionist Rutuja Diwakar
 View this post on instagramthe joy of eating desi - Every region has its own tradition of celebrating its seasonal produce using timeless, heritage recipes
 And i strongly believe that one should follow a diet that respects versus that which makes you feel like you have "cheated" if you eat a seasonal delicacy
 Changing the roti, sabzi and the accompaniments as the season changes, is something that we must cherish
 Nutrition societies across the globe are trying to adopt this practice from ancient cultures
 And on our part, we must ensure that this timeless practice is not forgotten and lost in the process of eating only meat or only soup-salad or not eating at all
 Health is not a size, it's a state
 a state of harmony, in the mind and body and between people and planet
 And really, all you need to do for that is to keep calm and eat makhan-roti-saag
 P
 S- - Makhan-roti-saag coz right now # kareenakapoorkhan is in Punjab
 - This is for dinner
 The Makhan, saag and roti and the quantities in the picture do NOT depict how much she eats
 The pic is taken after most of it is in her stomach
 Eat as per your hunger, not as per a fixed measure
 - Mein apni favourite hu is not just a dialogue, it’s a way of life that encourages you to eat all that is nice

 karnataka kii siyasat main phir twistmajboot mantralay maang rahe nae vidhayakyediurppa meeting ke baad pahunchenge dillikarnataka vidhansabha upachunaav main shandaar jeet darj kar apana loha manwaane vaale mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ke saamne nai chunauti khadi ho gai he
 Yeddyurappa has offered the winning mlas to be made ministers, but he does not like it
 vidhayakon ke man main kuch or hi he
 He is not only happy with the ministerial status, he also wants strong ministries
 5 disambar ko hue karnataka vidhansabha upachunaav ke nattejey 9 disambar ko aae the or bijepi ne 15 main se 12 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 The leaders who have won these seats are those who rebelled from the Congress or JDS and came to the BJP
 yediurppa kii sarkaar bane rahane ke liye 7 vidhayakon kii jarurat thi, lihaaja in nateezon ne yediurppa ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar ko majbootee di
 That is why Yeddyurappa declared the winning mlas a minister as soon as the result came
 rigelt aane ke baad hi yediurppa ne kaha ki jeetne vaale 12 vidhayakon main se 11 ko cabinet mantri banaaya jayega
 However, the newly elected MLA does not seem happy with Yeddyurappa's offer
 sutron ke mutabik, vidhayak demand kar rahe hai ki unhen grih, peedblyoody, sinchai or urja jaise manjbut mantralay die jaaen
 Why are strong ministries demanding? Newly elected legislators have also given the reason behind this demand
 sutron ke mutabik, in vidhayakon kaa maananaa he ki yediurppa sarkaar unke dam par chal rahi he, aise main unhen majboot mantralay die jane chahien
 Not only this, the demand for not ignoring the three leaders who have lost the election is being demanded by the mlas
 bataa den ki upachunaav main MTB nagaraj, vishwanath or roshan beg haar gaye the
 Yeddyurappa will reach Delhi, Yeddyurappa and newly elected mlas have an important meeting in Bengaluru today
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki iske baad yediurppa guuruuvaar ko dilli pahunchenge or haikaman se vidhayakon kii demand ke sambandh main charchaa karenge
 It is being told that the MLA is not ready to decline with his demand, in such a situation, a big challenge has arisen in front of Yeddyurappa to run a stable government
 bataa den ki may, 2018 main karnataka main chunaav hue the or bijepi ne sabase zyada siten jiti thim, lekin use bahumat nahin mil paaya tha
 After this, the Congress formed the government by supporting the JDS and HD Kumaraswamy became the Chief Minister
 haalanki, ye sarkaar zyada nahin chal pai thi or congress-jedies ke 17 vidhayak baagi ho gaye the, jinamein 16 bijepi ke paale main aa gaye the, jisase kumaraswami sarkaar gir gai thi or yediurppa siem ban gaye the
 Although the membership of these rebel mlas was canceled, the Supreme Court gave them permission to contest the by-elections
 philhal, maamla mantralayon ke bantwaare par maamla atak gaya he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see what path Yeddyurappa takes to fulfill the demand of newly elected mlas
 duniya main kuch rishte-naate khun se jude hote hai or kuch rishte ham khud hi banaate hai

 ek hi cycle par kabhi teenon logon kaa baith janaa or kabhi baaki donon kaa auto se aana-janaa or tisare kaa auto se res lagaana

 jalebi-kachori betting on volleyball matches held in hostels every Sunday and winning them

 Despite doing all the classes separately, spend the rest of the time together
 chaahe kisi kaa putala foonkna ho yaa gupachup kisi ladki ko dekhnaa ho
 i would refuse them and they would drag me along
 khaane se lekardhammachaukadi or filmein, sabakuch ek saath hi hota tha
 Today, all of us are fighting for life and employment in different places, but it is a bitter agreement between all of us that both of us will be present on the problem of any one
 maamla chaahe kisi ko kootane kaa ho yaa phir kisi ko jayamala ke stage par ooncha uthaane kaa

 agar aap jivan main amir or safal bananaa chaahate hai, to kuch baton kaa khaas khyaal rakhana hoga
 How a person becomes successful and successful depends on their lifestyle

 a severe earthquake in Himachal Pradesh can become a problem for the lives of millions of people at any time
 himachal pradesh sarakar or neshnal dizaster management athurity ke bich hui baithak main ye chaunkaa dene vaala khulaasa hua he, jiske mutabiq himachal pradesh ke shimla, sundernagara or dharmashala jone main joardaar bukamp kaa ek jhatka hi baari tabaahi ke liye kaaphi hoga
 Apart from this, the lakes formed by fast melting glaciers in Himachal Pradesh have also started knocking the danger in the coming time
 neshnal dizaster management athurity ne himachal main bukamp aane kii ashanka jataayi he
 Himachal Pradesh is a hilly state and many areas fall under the sinking zone
 lihaaja yahaan bukamp logon kii jaan ke liye ek bada khatra ban saktaa he
 After this, the state government has already started warning people in view of the possibility of earthquake
 shimla jaisi jagah par agar bukamp aata he to yahaan kai jaane ja sakati hai, jiskaa kaaran betaratib tareeke se banaaye gaye bhawan hai, jo ki bukamp ko sahan nahin kar sakate hai
 Shimla has a population of about three lakhs
 himachal pradesh ke mukhya sachiv sudripto raay kaa kahana he kii sarkaar apni taraf se to sthiti se nipatane ke liye taiyaar he, lekin janata ko bhi is babat chaukanna rahanaa behad jaruri hoga
 The Chief Secretary said that during a meeting with the National Disaster Management Authority, it was also revealed that the earthquake in 1905 had killed about 20,000 people in Kangra district alone, while a huge earthquake occurred every hundred years
 The possibility cannot be ruled out
 unhone kaha ki neshnal dizaster management athurity ne ek simulation kiya he, jisamen sundar nagar epicenter dikhaakar kaha he ki agar bukamp aata he or ek minute se kam samay tak bhucup rahata he to ek lakh logo kii maut ho sakhti he or isko lekar sarkaar alert he
 People are also being warned, the Chief Secretary also admitted that buildings in Shimla and other cities have been constructed in a random manner and if earthquake occurs then there can be a lot of damage
 neshnal dizaster management athurity or himachal sarkaar ke bich hui baithak main teji se pighalate glaciaron ke kaaran bani kai jhilein bhi aane vaale samay main ek bada khatra ban sakati hai
 These lakes can also cause huge havoc in areas of this hill state already where rivers and streams exist
 is baithak ke baad ab rajya sarkaar zyada aabaadi vaale ilaakon main bhawan nirmaan kaaryon ke kanoon ko kadaa karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 Chief Secretary Sudrypto Rai says that in the last 50 years a large number of buildings have been constructed in Shimla which are very dangerous from the point of view of earthquake
 aise bhawanon ko sarkaar ne surakshit ghoshit kiya hua he
 Sudrepto Rai says that now the government is preparing new plans on the De Congestion of Shimla to deal with the situation at the time of the earthquake
 himachal main 100 saal ke baad ek baar dobaaraa jabardast bukamp aane kii ashanka jataayi ja rahi he
 The 1905 earthquake killed about 20,000 people in Kangra alone
 neshnal dizaster management athurity ne kisi bhi samay shimla, sundernagara or dharmashala main bukamp se sabase zyada tabaahi kii jataai ashanka jataayi he
 The National Disaster Management Authority has also warned the government for lakes made of melting glaciers
 glacier pighalane ke kaaran bani jhilein bhi bada khatra ban sakati hai
 When every journalist and commentator in the world is fixing his or her own slaughter in Paris, this column would not want to distance itself from this fraternity
 ek baat to tay he ki pichley kuch samay se aatankiyon ke nishane par aise patrakaron kaa aana chalan-sa ban gaya he jo unke aade aate hai
 Why go away, how in the neighborhood of Pakistan, Wall Street Journal's Daniel Pearl was beheaded while his killer, despite being sentenced to death, is plotting to carry out such an act from jail itself
 bharat main patrakarita par pehla bada hamalaa assi ke dashak main punjab main dekhne main aayaa tha jab bhindranvaale ke logon ne na sirf kuch chuninda akhabaaron ke sampadakon, maalikon or reportron ko balki hokaron or vendoron tak ko maar daalaa tha
 The biggest murder was that of Lala Jagat Narayan, the owner and editor of the Hindi daily Punjab Kesari, and then his son Ramesh Chander, who handled the newspaper, was also killed
 akhbaar ke maujuuda sampadak ashvini kumaar chopra (minna) karnal se bijepi saansad hai jo aaj bhi baari suraksha ke saaye main chalate hai
 However, the Islamic world will have to answer a little too much
 puraani daleelein ab kisi ko raji nahin kar paatin ki aisi aatanki harkaton ko kuch mutthi bhar dehshatgard anjaam dete hai, lihaaja samooche samudaay ko doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa yaa phir yah ki islam main nirdosho kii jaan lenaa manaa he
 Most people consider this to be a very weak argument
 yah ab kargar nahin he kyonki ek ke baad ek ghat rahi aisi silsilewar ghatnaon ne sabit kiya he ki 'naram’ islamic jagat or uske pratinidhi ahm deshon or unke netaaon kii ore se kii jane vaali ninda shaayad hi kabhi beshart rahi ho
 There is always an expectation from their side on 'fundamental reasons' and innocent statements such as the unification of the whole world against terror are heard
 unka yah ravaiya tab zyada jaahir hota he jab aatank kaa shikaar koi aisa shaks hota he jisane kathith taur par aasthaa ko chot pahunchaai ho
 The same view is seen soon after the Paris assassination
 baaki samoochee duniya iske khilaaf jahaan baraabar aakrosh main he, vahiin sabase taqatvar islamic deshon jaise pakistan, misr, iran, saudi arab or yuai ke netaaon ne koi pratikriya di bhi he to vah behad satarkatapurna he
 Note that many of these countries themselves have such barbaric blasphemy laws under which Parisian cartoonists would be hanged anyway
 salmaan rushdi ke khilaaf iran ke fatve par shaayad hi kabhi islamic netaaon or vidwaanon ne sawaal uthaaya hoga or aisa tab he jabaki unamem se shaayad hi kisi ne un kathith apmanjanak adhyyon ko padhaa ho yaa phir (mere hi jaise) jaadui yatharthwaad ko samajhane kii salaahiyat rakhata ho
 You may find arguments such as "a sense of persecution of Muslims by the West" on 9 / 11 attacks in America
 bharat main 26 / 11 or uske jaisi ghatnaon ke liye to kashmir se shuru karke gujarat 2002 tak tamaam bahaane ginaae ja sakate hai
 Just wait for a few days and you will hear similar arguments on Sharli Abdo
 sawaal uthta he ki kya unhone vaaki cartoon main jyaadati kii thi?unki niyat ninda karne kii rahi ho yaa nahin, lekin kya unhen jaan-boojhkar ek mahaan dharm ko chot pahunchane vaali harakatein karke khud ko aazaadee or shishtataa kii antim sarhad par dhakel dene kii koi jarurat thi? jaahir he, aise tamaam sawaalon ke saath ek puchalla hameshaa judaa rahegaa ki ''aatank chaahe jaisaa ho bura hota he,” ''kisi ko bhi kisi kii jaan lene kaa haq nahin he,” vagairah
 i am thinking very carefully that in the Islamic world, there is no one you can find who can use the word 'innocent' for these journalists
 uparyukt tathyon or itihaas ke maddenjar jo kuch bhi swaabhaavik rup se tarkpurna lagata he, vahi kiya janaa aasaan bhi he—yani duniya bhar main uthe aakrosh kaa hissaa banaaya jaae, abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke saath ekajutata dikhaai jaae, phir isse koi fark nahin padataa ki usase chot kise pahunchi he
 i remember in 1989 that i did a cover story on Rushdie's edict for this magazine and used a dangerous quote from Leon Weisselcier, who was the literature editor of The New Republic, "I am thankful to God for Kufr Because only Kufr has freed us
 ”main rushdi ke likhane kii aazaadee ke saath khadaa hum, lekin abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke saath ekajutata dikhaane ke liye kya main use chhaapunga bhi? main aisa nahinkar paaungaa
 Shall i stop printing that offensive statement of Weisselier in defense of Kufr? Not at all
 kya main aisa kuch likhuunga, chhaapunga jise vastav main koi panth ish-ninda maanata ho? meraa jawaab phir naa hoga
 Now you may be able to hold both ends of my argument
 abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke prati meri vachanabaddhata sampurna or beshart he
 i will continue to defend your right to freedom of speech at any cost, even though i myself disagree with it and while pulling it off i would also like to say that my right to disagree is as intact as your right to freedom of expression
 is hafte ek ghatana par ubalati hui duniya main ab main jo baat kehane ja rahaa hum, usamen thodaa jokhim he: main un cartoonon ko dobaaraa chhapakar abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke saath ekajutata dikhaane or hatyaron par ungali uthaane se vinamratapurvak inkaar karata hum
 And i won't even tweet with the # jesuischarlie (i'm Charlie) hashtag
 agar mujhe phir bhi is masale par ek paala chunane ko kaha gaya, to badi mushkil se jindagi main kamai apni udaar or secular haisiyat (aajkal libral or secular ko vaise bhi libatard or sicular kah kar gaali dete hai) ko daanv par laga duungaa or kahuunga- -I Am NOT Charlie
 Still, i will defend Charlie's right to freedom of expression, no matter how bad those cartoons are
 jab paale khinch die gaye hon or aapako bas itnaa tay karnaa hota ho ki aap kisi cheez ke virodh main hai yaa paksh main, vaise main koi jatil yaa suvichaarit daleel dena khatarnaak hota he
 Nevertheless, i would like to say that on one hand completely defending the right to freedom of expression and on the other hand tweeting the hashtag in solidarity is contradictory in itself
 aapako saamne vaale kii bolne kii aazaadee kaa samarthan karte hue uski aalochana karne kii samarthy honi chahie
 You should not be pressured to agree with him or repeat his words or cartoons
 kisi kii abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii raksha karne kaa matlab yah nahin hota ki aapako uske kahe kii antarvastu ke saath sahamat hi hona he
 i have to listen to the disrespect from the left, south and middle class on this opinion, so i want to make it very clear here that in the event of being an editor of an Indian letter, i do not print these cartoons because they are not worth it, Are unnecessarily lethal and are not entertaining at all
 jis tarah main hashtag se vinamratapurvak inkaar kar rahaa hum, vaise hi main apni udaar or secular vachanabaddhata ko dikhaane ke liye soshal media par bhi in cartoonon ko nahin chhaapunga
 i have said this many times and it is such a universal truth that the greatest power and responsibility in the hands of an editor is to decide what he will print and what he will not, both of which he has to pay
 koi cheez jaan-boojhkar aasthaa ko chot pahunchane ke liye banaai gai he to main haath jodakar inkaar kar duungaa
 But if you are targeted for printing something like this elsewhere, then i will stand on the front to protect you
 mere is paksh par kuch swaabhaavik sawaal uthaae jaaenge jinhen main pehle hi yahaan ginava detaa hum
 What about issues on which people of other religions, especially Hindus feel hurt? Why do people who insult Hindu Gods not target Islam and Christianity? Just tell me what is your opinion on Aamir Khan and PK? What to say about those who are questioning the credibility of Ramayana and Mahabharata? M

 Whatever i want to do or say, i will protect his freedom, but i can agree with some, just accept some and criticize others
 isiilie pike kaa bachaav karne main mujhe koi dikkat nahin he kyonki yah film alian ke mutabik 'bhagavaanon ke prabandhakon’ yani baabaaon par hamalaa karti he or aajkal to vaise bhi yah prajati badnaam he, bhale hi saare jail main na bhi hon to kya
 As far as the attack on Hindu orthodoxy, superstitions, idolatry and customs are concerned, there is nothing new in this that the great reformers have not taught us in the past centuries, whether Gautama was Buddha, Gurunanak or Maharishi Dayanand
 hindu dharm sahishnu, rdhimukt or badlaav ke liye khulaa rahaa he, yahi vajah he ki iskaa failaav hua he or yah phala-phula he
 This is because Hinduism was open to criticism and new ideas and it digested everything within itself

 According to me, Hussain was undoubtedly free to make pictures of Hindu goddesses, but those who were offended had the right to perform and go to court, provided they did so in a peaceful manner
 udaar loktantron kii khubsuurati darasal isi main he ki unamem aapako virodh karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 The Supreme Court took the right decision to stop the harassment of Hussain by focusing the cases against him in a court in Delhi

 On the same lines, i said that Deepa Mehta did nothing wrong by showing a homosexual relationship between two deprived women in a Hindu middle-class family

 In liberal democracies, people aggrieved will get the right to protest within the ambit of the law
