 At the same time, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of the Indian team, said that if i would have won the toss, i would have also decided to field first
 dhoni ne yah bhi kaha ki test shrinkhalaa ke baad vanade maichon ke liye khud ko taiyaar karnaa mushkil hota he
 Pietersen's words proved to be true, but there was no sign of Dhoni's statement in India's innings
 chot kii vajah se eshanth sharma rajkot ekadivasiy nahin khel sake
 The two teams are as follows: India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Munaf Patel
 england:kevin petersan captain, ian bel, mat praayar, ovesh shah, andrew flintoff, paul collingwood, samit patel, ravi bopara, stuart broad, james anderson or steve harmison

 karnataka keshimogaloksabhaa upachunaav main do mukhyamantri ke beton ke maidan main utarane se muqabla dilachasp ho gaya he
 The BJP has fielded former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa's son b Raghavendra
 vahiin yediurppa kii is paramparaagat seat par jeet darj karne ke liye jedies-congress gathbandhan ne purv mukhyamantri es bangarappa ke bete madhu bangarappa ke tikat diya he
 Let us know that in the three Lok Sabha seats of Karnataka, Shimoga, Mandya and Bellary before November assembly elections in five states, voting is on November 3
 shimoga seat par yediurppa kii saakh daanv par lagi he, ye unke istipha dene ke baad khaali hui he
 The BJP has placed bets on Yeddyurappa's son for his political legacy
 jabaki purv siem es bangarappa congress kaa daaman chhodjedismen shaamil ho gaye the
 The congress-jds government is in the state, so the Shimago seat has gone to the JDS account
 yahaan se bangarappa ke bete ko tikat mila he
 Shimoga by-election is being considered as the semi-final of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isiilie donon partiyaan puri takat lagaae hue hai
 Aseen congress-jds has planned to beat Yeddyurappa in the fort of the state
 mana ja rahaa he ki yediurppa vipaksh main rahakar apane bete ko jeet dilaakar use raajnneetik rup se sthapit karana chaahate hai
 Let me tell you that in 2009 there was a tough fight between Sebangarappa and Yeddyurappa's son BJP candidate Raghavendra on this seat
 jisamen bangarppa mahaj 52 hajaar maton se raghavendra se haar gayi the
 At the same time, after Bangarappa's demise in 2014, Yeddyurappa won a major victory from Shimoga seat in the Modi wave
 is seat par lingayat samudaay kaa dabadabaa he isliye yediurppa parivaar ke liye ye jitau seat maani jaati he
 It is believed that BS Yeddyurappa's political future will also depend to a large extent on this victory
 agar bete ko jeet milti he to yediurppa bhavishya main karnataka ke siem ban sakate hai
 If the BJP misses the Shimoga Lok Sabha by-election, then it will be a difficult path for the party to win in the Lok Sabha elections 2019 like 2014
 vahiin congress-jedies gathbandhan is seat par jeet darj karti he to phir 2019 main bijepi ke liye rajya main pichley nattejey ko doharaana aasaan nahin hoga
 Along with Shimoga, Bellary seats are also being held
 bijepi ke number do ke netaa shriramulu kii bahan, je shanta ko party ne tikat diya gaya he or congress-jedies ne emelsi ugrappa ko maidan main utaara he
 a total of five by-elections are being held from Karnataka, three of which are Lok Sabha and two assembly seats
 videsh mantri or bijepi kii varisht netaa sushamaa swaraj ne saaf kar diya ki aglaa loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladengi
 He cited health reasons behind not contesting elections
 sushamaa swaraj ne vietnam main patrakaron ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki doctoron kii salaah par unhone chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Doctors have advised him to avoid dust and other allergic things
 haalanki unhone spasht ki chunaav nahin ladane kaa matlab yah katai nahin he ki vah raajnneeti se sanyas le rahi hai
 He said that he is fit after kidney transplant
 do din pehle indore main unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki vah aglaa loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahatin, unhone tab bhi swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala diya tha
 Sushma had said that 'the party has to take a decision on this but i have made up my mind not to contest the next election
 '66 saal kii sushamaa swaraj kaa 2016 main kidney transplant hua tha
 Since then, the discussion was in full swing that Sushma would hardly contest the next election but no official statement was made about this
 sushamaa ne kaha, 'doctoron ne mujhe dhulakanon se bachane kii salaah di he isliye main chunavi reliyon main bhaag nahin le sakati
 As soon as this news of Sushma Swaraj spread, the headlines in political circles intensified because she is named among the senior most BJP leaders
 bijepi ne unke is faisle par aupchaarik rup se kuch to nahin kaha lekin 'india today' ko sutron ne bataaya ki party chaahati he ki wo aage bhi chunaav laden or raajnneeti main sakriy bhoomika nibhaaen
 Sushma Swaraj became the Cabinet Minister of Haryana in 1977 at the age of just 25 years
 uske baad unhone kabhi peeche mud kar nahin dekha
 Vidisha MP Sushma Swaraj has won the Lok Sabha elections seven times
 iske saath hi bharat ke itihaas main wo duusari mahila hai jinhen videsh mantri kaa pad mila

 Let's stand in solidarity with them # dillichalo # kisanmuktimarch naanaa patekar apni aane vaali film 'abtak chappan 2' main gangster nahin balki safed poshaakon main chupe gundon se ladate nazar aaenge
 The film 'tak Tak Chappan 2' is a sequel to the famous film 'tak Tak Chappan' in which the first part was played by Nana Patekar inspired by the encounter specialist Daya Naik
 is kirdaar kaa naam tha sadhu adhashe
 This film and this character were highly appreciated
 ab is sikval main ek baar phir sadhu adhashe aparaadh se ladega, magar aparaadh or apradhi badale hue honge
 Nana said while talking to us that 'now the crime has also taken the shape of corporate
 ab ghotaale sainkadon karod main hote hai
 The crime has now overtaken the gangster
 or ye film kuch aise hi aaj ke jurm se ladaai ko darshaaegi
 ' naanaa ne ye bhi kaha ki 'pichhali film main meraa kirdaar encounter specialist kaa tha magar is film main main naukari chhod chukaa hum
 Therefore, i will not encounter
 mere kirdaar kii umr bhi bad gai he
 But the fight against crime and corruption continues in this film too
 ' The director of the first 'ab Tak Chhappan' was Shimit Amin
 or sikval kaa nirdesan kiya he ejaz gulab ne
 Ejaz was previously a stunt man who has done amazing stunts by becoming the body double of dozens of actors like Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Hrithik Roshan
 uske baad film 'shoot out ait lokhandwala, don-2 or rakt charitra' jaisi dheron ection filmon main bataur ection diarector kaam kiya he
 Now Gulab is stepping into the world of direction from the film 'ab Tak Chhappan 2'
 is film main asuthosh rana or gul panaag jaise kuch nae chehre shaamil hue hai
 And the film will be released on 27 February
 sikhon ke ek sanghathan dwaara france main apane adhikaron ke liye kiye gaye pradarshan par pratikriya dete hue france ke duutavas ne kaha ki saarvajanik rup se pagadi pahanane par france main koi roak nahin he
 The embassy said in a statement, "contrary to the allegations of some fundamentalist organizations, Sikhs have complete freedom to wear kopgadi in public places outside the premises of government schools
 saarvajanik sthanon par keval burka par roak he or vah bhi jaahir taur par suraksha kaarnon se
 The Embassy said, "in France, neither have Sikhs wearing turban on the streets suffered any misconduct nor has it ever happened at Sikh shrines
 ’bayaan ke anusaar, ‘france dharm kii aazaadee pradaan karata he or kisi ko is aadhaar par bhedbhaav kaa adhikaar nahin detaa
 There is no restriction on wearing turbans
 is maamle main france kaa kanoon bahut spasht he
 This prohibition on wearing of all religious symbols applies without discrimination and is only in government schools
 ’ duutavas ne kaha, ‘sarkari skulon ke pramukhon par nirbhar karata he ki vah sabase uchit kadam uthaayen taaki ise samvedansheel tareeke se lagu kiya ja sake
 ' america ke raashtrapatidonald trampake baaki deshon ko lekar unke ravaiye main pichley kuch dinon se hi narmi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Donald Trump said that working with countries like India, Russia and China is a good thing and not a bad thing
 unke is bayaan ko vishwa shanti ke lihaaj se ek shubh sanket mana ja saktaa he
 Because, whether Trump is North Korea or H1B visa, Russia or China, Trump has been softening his stand for the last few days
 aapako bataa den ki trump norge ke pradhanmantri erna solberg ke saath white house main sanyukt rup se ho rahe samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 These conferences were reacting to criticism of Trump's desire to improve relations with Russia
 unhone kaha, ‘‘rus yaa china yaa bharat yaa kisi bhi anya deshon ke saath kaam karnaa bahut acchhee baat he
 This is not a bad thing
 ’’ trump ne kaha ki unki najar sena ko majboot banane, badi maatra main tel or gas tathaa urja kaa bhandar karne par he lekin rus ke raashtrapati vladimir putin ko yah pasand nahin aa saktaa
 He further said that it would be much better to deal with North Korea where the US still has problems
 bataa den ki pichley hafte america raashtrapati donald trump ne kaha tha ki north korea ke leader kim jong un se vah phone se baat karne ko 'bilkul' taiyaar hai
 He hoped that the talks going on between North Korea and South Korea would yield some positive results
 unhone ab kaha, ‘‘yah meri dikkat nahin honi chahie thi
 It should have been resolved years ago when it was less dangerous
 lekin yah samasya mujhe di gai
 Trump has blamed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for this, saying he did not strengthen the military
 aapako bataa den ki hillari bhi pichlarashtrapati chunaavamein trump kii pratidwandi thim
 In a historic victory, Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 216 votes against 218
 supreme court ne is baat ke thos saboot maange hai ki cigarette pine se cancer hota he
 The Supreme Court asked this question during a hearing on a petition to make cigarette containers unattractive and colorless
 court ne poocha ki kya dhumrapaan se cancer hone kii baat ko pukhta taur par kaha ja saktaa he
 a bench of Chief Justice of India TS Thakur and UU Lalit asked advocate Aishwarya Bhati, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, 'how will you prove that smoking cigarettes causes cancer? Many people do not smoke, but they also get cancer
 kai log aise hai jo cigarette lagaataar pite hai, lekin puri jindagi swasth rahete hai
 Following the remarks by the cancer patient, the bench sought the Centre's reply on the petition
 yah yachika elahabaad ke 66 varshiya vakil umesh narayan sharma ne daayar kii he
 At the same time, he himself is accustomed to eating gutkha and smoking cigarettes
 unhen jeebh kaa or munh kaa cancer ho gaya he or mumbai ke ek aspataal main unka ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Umesh says that according to an estimate, by the year 2020 cigarette drinking and consumption of tobacco will kill about 1
5 million people all over the world
 unhone yachika main kaha, ki bharat main yuvaaon or bacchon ke bich tambaakoo kaaphi istemaal ho rahaa he
 The tempting packing is relieved for smoking, the trafficker said, that tobacco products come in quite attractive packets, which the youngsters are attracted to consume
 aisi packing ke kaaran log sehat ke liye likhi chetavanee ko bhi najrandaaj kar dete hai
 Writing the warning in capital letters and making the packing colorless will encourage people not to use such products

 sunil grover yani dow
 The show is not getting good response since the famous Gulati left 'the Kapil Sharma Show'
 vahiin sunil ke liye kaha ja rahaa tha ki vah sho par nahin lautenge
 Now Sunil Grover's fans be prepared for a good news
 sunne main aayaa he ki sunil grover kii sho par jald vaapasi ho sakati he
 It is reported that he will be shooting the show on 7 April
 iske baad 8, 11 or 12 april ke shedul main bhi maujuud rahenge
 What did Kapil Sharma write on Twitter after the controversies? Some Sunilindustry sources say that Sunil Grover is cutting his official holidays these days
 vahiin kuch ke hisaab se sunil ne sho chhod diya he
 His absence from Kapil Sharma's show raised many questions
 chandan prabhakar ne share kii apni beti kii pehali tasvirlekin sunil kii is sho main vaapasi kii badi ummid kii vajah he unka 23 april tak contract main bandhe hona
 If this is not completed, Sunil may have to pay a heavy compensation in lieu of it
 badha di gai he sunil kii fissutron kii maane to sunil kii sho main vaapasi production team ko mahangi padi he
 Sunil had asked for double fee to come back on The Kapil Sharma Show and the channel has accepted this demand in view of the falling TRP of the show without him
 kapil ke sho main raju shrivastav hue pakke, johny liver kii beti kii bhi entricya hoga jab saath main honge kapil or sunilakhabaron ke mutabik, australia se vaapasi ke dauraan flite main kapil sharma ne sunil grover se jhagada kiya tha
 It is said that he also hit the comedian of his own show by running a shoe
 jiske baad se sunil grover sho par nahin dikhe hai
 So does Kapil Sharma do a bad job with the audience too! Now when both are discussed to appear together on a stage then it will be interesting to see that they will be able to make their fans laugh with ease of old! desh main ‘aam aadmi’ kii haalat se aahat baliwood ke mahanayake amitabh bachchan ne kaha he ki aam aadmi anya logon kii tulana main zyada chust durust hote hai

 Amitabh said that i have known his aspirations, dreams, wishes from those people and most importantly, he does not want to be a common man ahead

 After the arrest of separatist leader Masrat Alamki in Jammu and Kashmir, the situation in the valley is getting worse
 bheed kii patharbaji se kareeb 16 log jakhmi ho gaye
 Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has also stood against the state government's stand
 mirwij kii aguwai main traal march ke dauraan jhadpasrinagar main patharbaji kii ghatana main kareeb 16 log jakhmi ho gaye, jinamein police ke jawan bhi shaamil hai
 The protest was led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq
 mirwij sena ke oparation main yuvak ke maare jane ke virodh main traal ja rahe the
 The supporters of Mirwaiz also raised anti-india slogans
 patharbaji rokane ke liye police ne pehle lathicharge kaa sahaara liya or aansu gas ke gole chode
 In fact, after that incident, the local people described the young man as a resident there, while the army had declared him a terrorist
 jume kii namaaj ke baad hui jhadpasrinagar ke purana shahar ilaake main jume kii namaaj ke baad patharav kar rahe pradarshnakariyon or surakshabalon ke bich jhadap hui
 Clashes broke out with the security forces of the stone-pelting youth soon after the prayers of the jama outside the Jamia Mosque in Nauhatta in the Old City area
 pradarshan hinsak ho gaya, kyonki yuvaaon ne surakshabalon par patharav kar diya
 Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who also offered prayers at the Ublejamia mosque after Masrat's arrest, on Friday criticized the state government for the detention of separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani and Masrat Alam
 mirwij umr ne unki tatkaal rihaai kii maang kii or kaha ki kashmir main kanoon todane ke liye algaavvaadi nahin, balki rajya sarkaar jimmedaar he
 Mirwaiz said, 'they detain hundreds of our youth without any reason and then accuse us of breaking the law
 niyam rajya sarkaar tod rahi he, na ki algaavvaadi netaa
 He, however, called for a peaceful protest after the namaz at the gathering on Friday
 vajah masarat kii giraftaar ho yaa traal main encounter main kathith nirdosh ke maare jane kaa tark, ghati ke saikadon yuvaaon ne phir haathon main pathar uthaa liye
 The stone for protest and political practice is 'stone', in fact, stonewalling is also a weapon of protest in Kashmir and also a weapon to practice politics
 saal 2010 main masarat ne patharbaajon kii ek fouj taiyaar kii thi
 Not only did he rock the valley through continuous stone-pelting, but because of this, more than 100 people lost their lives
 jab phir ghati main patharbaji dikhi, to sawaal yahi uthaa ki ghati main kitne masarat hai?ghati main hoti rahi he patharbajeepatharbaji kii ghatnaayen ghati main nai nahin hai
 Although there have not been many cases of stone pelting this year, it can be said that the most favorite and tried sport of protest against the youth of the valley is stone pelting
 kashmir main janvari 2009 se janvari 2014 ke bich patharbaji ke 1733 maamle darj kiye gaye
 The then Chief Minister Omar Abdullah himself said in response to a question by Mehbooba Mufti in the Assembly: 737 of these 1733 cases were in Srinagar, 256 in Baramulla, 191 in Anantnag, 87 in Kulgam, 127 in Pulwama, 53 in Kupwara, 79 In Shopian, 75 were recorded in Ganderbal and 127 in Bandipora
 in maamalon main kareeb 9200 yuvaaon ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 The case was later concluded by granting amnesty to 1800 youths
 darasal, ghati ke yuvaaon kaa gussa patharbaji ke rup main nikalataa he
 One reason for this is that they do not get the right political platform of protest
 kya he patharbaajon kii maansikta
 
 
 According to the study done by Professor Rafi Butt of the University of Kashmir on the stonework: - About 71 percent of the stone pelters perform stones in tension and anger
 --kareeb 17 fisadi maje ke liye patharbaji karte hai
 - Around 12 per cent of the people are paid for stone pelting
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki ghati main aae ubaal ke vakt haath main pathar thame log kis vajah se pathar thame hai? In such a situation, you have to keep yourself updated with the new program so that you can give better work on the new program in every company

 The differences between the two government ministries over the ban on Uber taxis have come to the fore
 ek ore jahaan grih mantralay ne sabhi rajyon ko chitthee likhakar ubar jaisi taxi sevaaon par bain lagane ko kaha he, vahiin kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne is pabandi kaa virodh kiya he
 Gadkari said today that if there is a rape in the train or bus, will the rail and bus stop the service
 ubar taxi main rape kii ghatana ke baad company par pratibandh lagane ke 24 ghante ke bheetar parivahan mantri gadakari ne ye bayaan dekar ek nai bahes ched di
 Questions arose whether the matter was under review within the government
 lekin kuch hi ghante main ye baat saaf ho gai ki sarkaar gadakari ke saath nahin he, jab grih mantri ne rajyasabha main elaan kar diya ki sabhi rajyon or kendra shasit pradeshon ko salaah di gai he ki vah web−besd taxi seva ke sanchaalan par roak laga den
 Rajnath also made it clear that the transport department of Delhi administration has banned Uber operations in NCR region
 darasal gadakari ke bayaan ne ubar taxi main mahila se hue balaatkaar kii ghatana ke raajnneetik asar se nipatane kii jaddojahad main juty sarkaar kii mushkilen badha di hai

 During the debate in Rajya Sabha, Congress MP Rajiv Shukla asked why Uber was banned when the road transport minister is against the ban
 itnaa hi nahin gadakari bayaan dekar apano ke bich hi akele pad gaye
 Union Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptulla insisted that action should be taken against both the company and the driver, while former Home Secretary and BJP MP RK Singh said that Uber should take strict action against the company by registering a criminal case, as it has done without The driver of the investigation was kept on notice
 yah bhi sach he ki sirf pratibandh hi samasya kaa aakhri ilaaj nahin he

 Yogi Adityanath's encounter raj was told in the Investigative Report of Aaj Tak / India Today on April 4 that how some of the alleged criminals who were killed in police encounters have been accused of torturing them
 in gharavaalon ke mutabik jab farji muthbhed kii shikaayat rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog (NHRC) se kii gai to ghar ke purush sadasyon ke khilaaf police ne gangrape ke cese darj kara die
 a day after this story, it was claimed by the UP Police that whatever cases have been filed, there is a solid basis behind them
 meerut jone ke ediji prashanth kumaar ne vaada kiya he ki agar sthaneey police kii ore se kahin jyaadati kii shikaayat he to sambandhit parivaar iske nivaaran ke liye varisht police adhikariyon se sampark kar sakate hai
 On April 4, India Today report had told how the families of the alleged criminals who died in the mutiny were being pressured by the police to withdraw the complaint from the NHRC
 is report main aise kam se kam teen maamalon ko saamne laayaa gaya tha
 On Thursday, Aaj Tak / India Today reached the home of the 'rape victim' in Bhura village of Kairana who lodged an FIR against the families of two criminals named Naushad and Sarwar
 naushaad or sarwar beete saal 29 july ko police muthbhed main maare gaye the
 The woman, aged around 30, described herself as a laborer, but she was wearing an expensive watch and silk embroidered salwar kameez
 ye mahila us ghar se kuch duuri par hi rahati he jahaan naushaad apni maa or bhai ke saath rahata tha
 The woman alleged that Naushad and Sarwar's family members raped her several times, but she did not inform the police about the fear
 mahila ne ajtak / india today se kaha, ‘main police main jaakar shikaayat karne ko lekar bahut dari hui thi
 i filed a complaint only when both of them (naushad and Sarwar) were killed
 naushaad kii giraftaar kii vajah bataaya jane vaala aarope jhootha he, kyonki uskaa parivaar mujhe fansaana chahta tha
 At the same time, Naushad's family says that she is the same woman from the village who, on the midnight of July 28, evicted Naushad and Sarwar from their homes and both got caught in a police net
 naushaad ke gharavaalon kaa aarope he ki ye mahila sthaneey police ke kehane par hi chal rahi thi kyonki wo police mubir he
 Naushad's brother Imam says- 'the police filed rape cases against me, my uncle
 ye hamaari ore se encounter kii shikaayat darj karaae jane ke thik ek din baad hua
 There is pressure on us to withdraw the complaint and settle it
 ham chaahate hai ki ye sab jaldi khatm ho
 Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Police has defended the rape charge FIR against the families of the alleged criminals killed in the encounters as a correct step
 meerut jone ke edijipi prashanth kumaar ne india today se kaha, ‘main aaropon se sahamat nahin hum
 If the police has committed excesses, they can contact various forums, testify before the magistrate
 agar unke parivaar ke sadasyon ne aparaadh kiya he to ye hamaari duty he ki samuchit jaanch ke baad cese darj karaaen
 The ADGP also called Encounters right
 edijipi ne kaha ki sirf unheen maamalon main jahaan aparaadhiyon ne goli chalaai, vahiin javaabi karrwai kii gai
 The priority of the government is to control crime and criminals
 inase nipatane ke liye hamen aazaadee di gai he
 The senior police officer said that the encounter is not the policy of the government
 police aparaadhiyon ke goli chalaane par hi karrwai karti he
 He also denied the claims of fake encounters
 edijipi ne kaha, hamaari range main 150 pulicekarmi ghayal hue or ek consteble kii maut hui
 i do not agree with the allegations of fake encounters, yes we are dealing with criminals in a pro-active manner
 edijipi prashanth kumaar ne daawa kiya ki sakhti barte jane kaa sakaaratmak asar hua he
 There are areas from where people migrated, now they are returning back

 Sufi is unsuccessfully trying to divert attention from the core subjects by holding a conference to hide its failures
 madani ne kaha ki sufi sammelan yojit karne waalon se hamaara koi matbhed nahin he
 Because our Allah is one, the Prophet one, the Quran one, the ways of worship are one
 vastav main jo log dharm ko nahin samajhate ve virodh karte hai
 He said that we see the organization of Sufi Conference under the patronage of the present government and under the supervision of high officials
 vigyaan bhawan main pradhanmantri ne dhai ghante se adhik samay diya isse is andeh ko bal miltaa he
 Maulana Madani also said that the Prime Minister has called Islam a religion of peace and love and also stressed that there is no religion of terrorism and this fight is not against any religion but the truth of these kinds of things There is no connection
 unhone kaha ki desh main jaise hi koi aatankwaad kii ghatana hoti he, shaq kii sui na keval musalamaanon kii ore mode di jaati he balki giraftaaryaan bhi shuru kar di jaati hai
 Something is said to the tongue, the opposite is done
 madani ne kaha ki vastav main ek varg kaa sangrakshan karke vartmaan sarkaar musalamaanon ke andar panth ke naam par kalah evam araajaktaa paidaa karke apni vifaltaaon par pardaa daalane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 The comments ‘bharat mata kii jai’ ke sawaal par moulana madani ne kaha ki iskaa urdu main anuwaad ‘maadar-e-vatan jindabad’ kiya jaataa he
 Muslims also shout slogans of 'madar-e-watan Zindabad' and 'hindustan Zindabad'

 But if some people keep something else in their heart or consider it as 'mabud' and talk of worship then it is not justified
 yah unka apana maamla he, ham allaah ke sivaa kisi kii ibaadat nahin karte hai

 Madani said that we have no differences with those who organized Sufi Conference
 kyonki hamaara allaah ek, paigambar ek, quran ek, ibaadat ke tareeke ek hai
 In fact, those who do not understand religion protest
 unhone kaha vartmaan sarkaar ke sangrakshan or ucch adhikariyon kii dekharekh main sufi sammelan ke aayojan ko ham khatre kii drushti se dekhte hai
 The Prime Minister gave more than two and a half hours to Vigyan Bhawan, this reinforces this doubt

 He said that as soon as any terrorism incident occurs in the country, the needle of suspicion is not only diverted towards Muslims but arrests are also started
 zabaan se kaha kuch jaataa he kaary iske vipareet hota he

 tippaniyan On the question of 'bharat Mata ki Jai', Maulana Madni said that it is translated into Urdu as 'madar-e-watan Zindabad'
 musalmaan bhi ‘maadar-e-vatan jindabad’ or ‘hindustan jindabad’ ke naare lagaate hai
 There is no harm in this
 lekin agar kuch log dil main kuch or rakhte hai yaa use ‘mabood’ samajhakar puja kii baat karte hai to yah jaays nahin
 It is their own matter, we do not worship anyone except Allah
 jamiat ulema-e-hind ke adhyaksh ne kaha ki mul mudda bharat mataaki jai nahin, yah mul mudde se dhyaan hataane or use peeche daalane kii ranneeti he

 You can also add your questions, through this you can change the media sitting at home

 On 21 September 2018, the statement of former French President François Hollande came that a condition was laid by the Indian government to benefit Anil Ambani's company
 us din ke baad se koi ek yaa do hindi ke akhbaar len
 Make a file by cutting every news printed on Rafal in these newspapers
 file jab ban jaae to dhyaan se ek ek khabar ko padhein or kuch sawaal banaaen
 See when and when the news of Rafal has appeared on the front page
 kya tabhi chhapi he jab kisi mantri ne yaa rafaal banane vaali company ne saude main anil ambani kii company ko laabh pahunchane se inkaar kiya he, ghotaalaa na hone kaa daawa kiya he
 Has the news of Rafal appeared prominently on the front page even when Rahul Gandhi has made allegations about Rafal
 is tarah se aap test karenge ki yah khabar aapke akhbaar ke liye pramukh kab he
 After testing the prominence, you test the details
 rafaal vimaan main ghotaalaa hua, is sambandh main jitne aarope lage hai, kya unhen vistaar se chapa gaya he, rafaal vimaan main ghotaalaa nahin hua kya is khabar ko puure vistaar ke saath chapa gaya he
 You will understand the difference
 rafaal maamle main sirf rahul gandhi aarope nahin laga rahe hai
 Many journalists covering defense matters such as Ajay Shukla in Business Standard, Rohini Singh in Wire, Sushant Singh in Express, Vishnu Som in NDTV and Saikat Dutta in Scroll can see the reporting
 rohinee singh ne to apni report main dastauez bhi lagaae
 The reports of these journalists have also raised many questions, has your Hindi newspaper brought these questions to you, do you know how Ajay Shukla has written a report in three installments about how the Rafale plane deal was 40 percent from the earlier deal It has been done at a higher price
 agar aapako ye sawaal nahin maaloom to phir aap rafaal saude ko nahin samaj paaenge
 Apart from this, Prashant Bhushan, Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie have filed petitions in the court
 sawaal uthaae hai
 These people also keep press conferences in many places
 kya inke uthaae sawaalon ko detail main chapa jaataa he
 The answers to your questions will tell you how much your newspaper has updated regarding the Rafale deal
 yahi test aap channelon ke saath kar sakate hai

 supreme court main rafaal vimaan par teen baar sunwaayee ho chuki he
 The hearing lasted for about three and a half hours on 14 November
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii bench is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Joseph are also part of this bench
 dipti cheef of air staff bhi is maamle main apana paksh rakhane aae the tab adaalat main chutki bhi lee gai ki air marshall ab ja sakate hai, yah alag kism kaa war room he
 Three top Air Force officers have presented their case
 yashavanth sinha, arun shouri or sanjay singh, vinit handa, em el sharma yachikakarta hai jo is maamle kii esaiti jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 KK Venugopal was responding on behalf of the government
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki isaki samiksha court ko nahin kerani chahie lekin sunwaayee ke baad kya faisla aayega intazaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Journalists who have gone to cover the case say that both the government and the petitioner were asked difficult questions on behalf of the bench
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne lagaataar reporting kii he
 i am presenting part of their sent news
 - prashanth bhushan kaa sawaal tha ki do deshon kii sarkaar ke bich agreement se kiya gaya taaki tender na jari kerani pade
 - The government has not told who will be responsible if Dasso is not able to provide Rafaal
 - sarkaar ne france se sowran guarantee nahin lee, inter governmental agreement main aage bad gai
 - The Law Ministry had expressed concern that if there was a dispute, the decision would be in Geneva which would not be good for India
 - is par court ne sarkaar se poocha ki kya france ne bharat ko guarantee di he? - Attorney General said there is no sovereign guarantee, letter of comfort
 - chif justise ne poocha ki to aapke paas koi guarantee nahin he? - The government says that this is a sensitive matter
 desh kii suraksha kaa maamla he
 After this there was a debate about the offset partner
 aap jaanate hai ki dasso ne ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko apana partner chunaa he
 According to the company, it has selected thirty companies including Ambani as partners
 is sawaal kaa sandarbh he ki deal hone ke kuch din pehle tak hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam iske liye tha, magar deal hone ke baad pataa chalata he ki ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko jagah mili he
 Rahul Gandhi is constantly alleging that Anil Ambani's company has been benefited
 ofaset partner ke sawaal par bhi sarkaar ne sikret rakhane kii sharton kaa hawala diya
 Prashant Bhushan raised questions
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki vah ofaset partner ke bare main nahin jaanati he jo tay kii gai prakriya ke khilaaf he
 Prashant Bhushan alleged that the process of fixing the offset was changed from the back date
 - atorni general ne kaha he ki guppatata kaa qaraar he to baaten gupt rakhni hi hongi
 - Justice m Joseph then asked what would happen if the offset partner ran away? - tab sarkaar ne kaha ki kantrect kii sharten ofaset partner par bhi lagu hoti hai
 - Prashant Bhushan said that how can the government say that it is not known when the process is clear that it cannot happen without the permission of the Defense Minister
 - atorni general kehete hai ki ofaset partner kaa faisla hone se pehle hi saude par dastakhat ho gaye the
 - We needed 36 aircraft immediately, so changed the deal
 supreme court ke faisle se hi pataa chalegaa ki ofaset partner ke liye deal badal di gai yaa phir vaaki jaldi vimaan chahie the iske liye deal badali gai
 On this, the petitioners say that between 2019 and 22 only planes will arrive
 saude ke saadhe teen saal ho gaye magar abhi tak ek bhi vimaan nahin aayaa he
 At the press conference of March 25, 2015, Dasso CEO said that the deal would be finalized soon
 saude ke 95 fisadi par sahmati ban gai he
 Through technology transfer, HAL will create many devices
 magar echeel saude se baahar ho gai
 No one was asked
 raksha mantri ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 The government knows that 36 aircraft is not enough for the Air Force, then why was it reduced from 126 to 36
 pradhanmantri ne kaise ghoshnaa kar di
 The deal was changed because the Prime Minister wanted to include Ambani
 ab ham aapako do video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 March 25, 2015, a month before the deal was signed and November 13, 2018, both belong to the same person
 dasso ke siio kaa
 On 25 March, the same person is taking the name of HAL, but is ani's Smita telling Prakash what he knew then, why he had taken the name of HAL
 aap bhi padhein
 
 
 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande
 siio kaa yah bayaan 25 march 2015 kaa he
 Twenty days before the agreement
 isamen aapane padhaa ki ve bol rahe hai ki echeel ke chairman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 The chairman has said that HAL is ready to shoulder the responsibilities associated with the deal
 ab ve 13 november ko kya kehete hai eenai kii smita prakaash se, wo bhi padhie
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the
 The deal was 126 aircraft
 ham echeel or bhartiya vayusena ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 i said about HAL, it's true
 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai
 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 dekhie ki rafaal kii khabar kab-kab pehle panne par chhapi he
 Has it appeared only when a minister or the company making Rafale has refused to benefit Anil Ambani's company in the deal, claiming not to be a scam
 kya tab bhi rafaal kii khabar pehle panne par pramukhataa se chhapi he jab rahul gandhi ne rafaal ko lekar aarope lagaae hai
 This way you will test when this news is prominent for your newspaper
 pramukhataa kaa test karne ke baad aap detail kaa test karen
 Rafael plane scam, the allegations that have been made in this regard, have they been raided in detail, has there been a scandal in Rafale aircraft, has this news been published in full detail
 aap fark samaj jaaenge
 Rahul Gandhi is not just making allegations in the Rafale case
 raksha maamalon ko cover karne vaale kai patrkaar jaise bijness standard main ajay shukla, vir main rohinee singh, express main sushant singh, enditivi main vishnu som or scrol main sikat datta kii reporting dekh sakate hai
 Rohini Singh even put documents in his report
 in patrakaron kii report se bhi kai sawaal uthe hai, kya aapke hindi akhbaar ne in sawaalon ko aap tak pahunchaaya he, kya aapako pataa he ki ajay shukla ne teen kishton main report likhi he ki kaise rafaal vimaan kaa sauda pehle ke saude se 40 percent adhik daam par kiya gaya he
 If you do not know this question, then you will not understand the Rafale deal
 iske alaava prashanth bhushan, yashavanth sinha, arun shouri ne court main yachika di he
 Has raised questions
 ye log kai jagahon par press conference bhi karte rahete hai
 Are their questions raised in detail? aapke sawaalon ke jawaab aapako bataa denge ki rafaal saude ko lekar aapke akhbaar ne kitna apadet kiya he
 You can do the same test with channels
 koi ek bulatin chun len or phir uskaa vishleshan kar len
 The Rafale plane has been heard thrice in the Supreme Court
 14 november ko kareeb saadhe teen ghante kii sunwaayee chali
 The bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi is hearing the case
 justise sanjay kishan kaul or justise joseph bhi is bench kaa hissaa hai
 The Deputy Chief of Air Staff also came to present his case in this case, when the court was also pinched that Air Marshals can go now, it is a different type of war room
 air force ke teen bade adhikariyon ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Sanjay Singh, Vinit Handa, ML Sharma are the petitioners seeking SIT investigation in the matter
 sarkaar kii taraf se ke ke venugopal jawaab de rahe the
 The government says that it should not be reviewed by the court, but what decision will come after the hearing can be waited
 maamle ko cover karne gaye patrakaron kaa kahana he ki bench kii taraf se sarkaar or yachikakarta donon se mushkil sawaal puche gaye
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava has done continuous reporting
 unheen kii bheji khabar kaa hissaa pesh kar rahaa hum
 The question of Prashant Bhushan was that the agreement between the government of two countries was done so that tender would not be issued
 - sarkaar ne yah nahin bataaya ki agar dasso rafaal nahin de paati he to koun zimmedaar hoga
 - The government did not take the sovereign guarantee from France, proceeded to the inter-governmental Agreement
 - kanoon mantralay ne chintaa jataai thi ki agar vivaad hua to faisla geneva main hoga jo bharat ke liye acha nahin hoga
 On this, the court asked the government whether France had given a guarantee to India? - atarni general ne kaha ki koi samprabhu guarantee nahin he, letters of confort he
 - Chief Justice asked if you have no guarantee? - sarkaar kahati he ki yah samvedansheel maamla he
 There is a matter of security of the country
 iske baad ofaset partner ko lekar bahes chhidi
 You know that Dasso has chosen Anil Ambani's company as its partner as an offset partner
 company ke hisaab se usne ambani sahit tees companiyon ko partner chunaa he
 There is a reference to the question that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was named for it till a few days before the deal, but after the deal, it is known that Anil Ambani's company has got a place as an offset partner
 rahul gandhi lagaataar aarope laga rahe hai ki anil ambani kii company ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya he
 On the question of the offset partner, the government also cited the conditions of keeping secret
 prashanth bhushan ne sawaal uthaae
 - Prashant Bhushan said that the government says that it does not know about the offset partner which is against the procedure laid down
 - prashanth bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki ofaset tay karne kii prakriya badal kar back date se lagu kar di gai
 - The Attorney General has said that if there is an agreement of confidentiality, then things have to be kept secret
 - tab justise ke em joseph ne poocha ki agar ofaset partner bhaag gaya tab kya hoga? - Then the government said that the contract conditions also apply to the offset partner
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kaise kah sakati he ki pataa nahin jabaki prakriya se saaf he ki raksha mantri kii anumati ke bina nahin ho saktaa he
 - The Attorney General says that the deal was signed before the offset partner was decided
 - hamen 36 vimaan fouran chahie thi isliye deal badal di
 It will be known only by the decision of the Supreme Court that the deal was changed for the offset partner or if the aircraft was needed really quickly, the deal was changed for this
 is par yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki 2019 se 22 ke bich hi vimaan aaenge
 It has been three and a half years since the deal, but not a single aircraft has arrived yet
 25 march 2015 ke press conferes main dasso ke siio ne kaha ki deal jald final hogi
 95% of the deal has been agreed
 takanic transfar ke zarie echeel kai upkaran banayega
 But HAL pulled out of the deal
 kisi se nahin poocha gaya
 The Defense Minister did not even know
 sarkaar jaanati he ki airforce ke liye 36 vimaan kaaphi nahin he to phir 126 se ghataakar 36 kyon kiya gaya
 How did the Prime Minister declare
 deal isliye badali gai kyonki pradhanmantri ambani ko shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 Now we want to show you two videos
 25 march 2015 kaa yani deal hone ke ek maheenaa pehle kaa or 13 november 2018 kaa, donon ek hi shaks kaa he
 Of the CEO of Dasso
 25 march ko yahi shaks echeel kaa naam le rahaa he magar kya eenai kii smita prakaash ko bataa rahaa he ki use tab kya jaankaree thi, usne kyon echeel kaa naam liya tha

 The ceo's statement is dated 25 March 2015
 qaraar se bees din pehle kaa
 In it you read that they are saying that you can imagine my satisfaction by hearing from the Chairman of HAL
 chairman ne kaha he ki echeel is deal se judi zimmedaariyon ko uthaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Now what they say on November 13 is from Smita Prakash of ANI, read that too
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal

 We were working with HAL and the Indian Air Force
 maine echeel ke bare main kaha tha, yah sach he
 But they are not telling how HAL got out of the deal
 ve yah bhi nahin kah rahe hai ki echeel ke bare main unhone kaha to tha magar jab wo deal se baahar ho gai to sunakar hairaani hui
 His answer does not show much power
 ve echeel kii tarif bhi karte hai lekin jawaab main spashtataa nahin he
 Listen to all their answers yourself and try to understand
 to ofaset partner kaise chunaa gaya, iske chune jane kii kya prakriya thi, kya uskaa paalan hua, phir rafaal bimaan ke daam ko lekar bahes hai
 Ajay Shukla has written a long report of three installments on Rafale prices in Business Standard
 jisamen daawa kiya he ki modi sarkaar ke samay jo qaraar hua he uske anusaar 40 pratishat adhik keemat di ja rahi he
 Let us know that Dasso CEO from ani's Smita Prakash has claimed that the deal is already 9 percent cheaper
 28 agast ko vitt mantri or purv raksha mantri arun jetali blog likhte he ki endie kii deal upie se 9 pratishat sasti he
 Jaitley is talking about 9 percent cheaper deals on basic aircraft
 phir jetali kehete hai ki bharat kii zaruuraton ke mutabik is aircraft ko las kiya jaataa he wo bhi upie kii tulana main 20 pratishat kam he
 The CEO of Dasson has said that the existing aircraft are 9 per cent cheaper but their reply does not indicate whether they are talking about basic aircraft or the price of aircraft equipped with India's needs according to Jaitley
 - sarkaar ne rafaal vimaan kii keemat silband lipaphe main supreme court ko saunpi he
 - Prashant Bhushan argued that price did not threaten national security
 - rafaal vimaan kii sari jaankariyaan saarvajanik hai
 - The price of Rafale aircraft has also been mentioned in Parliament
 - atarni general ne kaha ki sansad main bina hathiyaar va upkaran se las jet kii keemat bataai gai
 - Without the approval of France, you cannot tell the price of a fully finished jet
 vaise 8 march ko india today se france ke raashtrapati maikron ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar chaahe to rafaal vimaan ke ditels vipaksh se saajha kar sakati he
 KK Venugopal said that if confidential information was made public without the knowledge of France, it would be a violation of the inter-governmental Agreement
 sarkaar ne rafaal deal ke nyaayik pareekshan kaa virodh kiya he
 KK Venugopal said that he too has not seen the sealed report
 isliye keemat ke bare main kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 - Chief Justice asked if the price was not disclosed in the old 2007 deal also? - kya us vakt bhi hathiyaaron va upkarnon kii jaankaree ko gopneey rakhaa gaya tha - The Attorney General said that was confidential even at that time
 is par prashanth bhushan ne hastkshep kiya or kuch report dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin tab chif justise ne kaha ki aapane vakt par ye report daakhil nahin kii
 There can no longer be a two-hour hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jab ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar rafaal vimaan kargil yuddh ke dauraan bharat ke paas hota to kai sainikon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 On this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi intervened to the Attorney General, saying that the Kargil war took place in 1999-2000 and the Rafale aircraft arrived in 2014
 is tarah ke bayaan mat dijie
 a lot of questions are being answered even among journalists about this
 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the
 Modi was not the Prime Minister
 - julian- dasso kii tab mukesh ambani ke reliance group se baat ho rahi thi na ki anil ambani ke reliance group se
 It was a different company
 rafaal ke siio se puche gaye sawaal or unke jawaab

 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal
 eenai kii smita prakaash se siio trephiye kehete hai ki meri company clin he
 But in 1998 Dasso's director was sentenced to 18 months in the case of taking bribe
 usne kantrect lene ke liye 1998 main belgium ke netaaon ko rishwat di thi
 Many journalists covering defense matters such as Ajay Shukla in Business Standard, Rohini Singh in Wire, Sushant Singh in Express, Vishnu Som in NDTV and Saikat Dutta in Scroll can see the reporting
 rohinee singh ne to apni report main dastauez bhi lagaae
 The reports of these journalists have also raised many questions, has your Hindi newspaper brought these questions to you, do you know how Ajay Shukla has written a report in three installments about how the Rafale plane deal was 40 percent from the earlier deal It has been done at a higher price
 agar aapako ye sawaal nahin maaloom to phir aap rafaal saude ko nahin samaj paaenge
 Apart from this, Prashant Bhushan, Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie have filed petitions in the court
 sawaal uthaae hai
 These people also keep press conferences in many places
 kya inke uthaae sawaalon ko detail main chapa jaataa he
 The answers to your questions will tell you how much your newspaper has updated regarding the Rafale deal
 yahi test aap channelon ke saath kar sakate hai
 Select one of the bulletins and then analyze it
 supreme court main rafaal vimaan par teen baar sunwaayee ho chuki he
 The hearing lasted for about three and a half hours on 14 November
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii bench is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Joseph are also part of this bench
 dipti cheef of air staff bhi is maamle main apana paksh rakhane aae the tab adaalat main chutki bhi lee gai ki air marshall ab ja sakate hai, yah alag kism kaa war room he

 KK Venugopal was responding on behalf of the government
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki isaki samiksha court ko nahin kerani chahie lekin sunwaayee ke baad kya faisla aayega intazaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Journalists who have gone to cover the case say that both the government and the petitioner were asked difficult questions on behalf of the bench
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne lagaataar reporting kii he
 i am presenting part of their sent news
 - prashanth bhushan kaa sawaal tha ki do deshon kii sarkaar ke bich agreement se kiya gaya taaki tender na jari kerani pade
 - The government has not told who will be responsible if Dasso is not able to provide Rafaal
 - sarkaar ne france se sowran guarantee nahin lee, inter governmental agreement main aage bad gai
 - The Law Ministry had expressed concern that if there was a dispute, the decision would be in Geneva which would not be good for India
 - is par court ne sarkaar se poocha ki kya france ne bharat ko guarantee di he? - Attorney General said there is no sovereign guarantee, letter of comfort
 - chif justise ne poocha ki to aapke paas koi guarantee nahin he? - The government says that this is a sensitive matter
 desh kii suraksha kaa maamla he
 After this there was a debate about the offset partner
 aap jaanate hai ki dasso ne ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko apana partner chunaa he
 According to the company, it has selected thirty companies including Ambani as partners
 is sawaal kaa sandarbh he ki deal hone ke kuch din pehle tak hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam iske liye tha, magar deal hone ke baad pataa chalata he ki ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko jagah mili he
 Rahul Gandhi is constantly alleging that Anil Ambani's company has been benefited
 ofaset partner ke sawaal par bhi sarkaar ne sikret rakhane kii sharton kaa hawala diya
 Prashant Bhushan raised questions
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki vah ofaset partner ke bare main nahin jaanati he jo tay kii gai prakriya ke khilaaf he
 Prashant Bhushan alleged that the process of fixing the offset was changed from the back date
 - atorni general ne kaha he ki guppatata kaa qaraar he to baaten gupt rakhni hi hongi
 - Justice m Joseph then asked what would happen if the offset partner ran away? - tab sarkaar ne kaha ki kantrect kii sharten ofaset partner par bhi lagu hoti hai
 - Prashant Bhushan said that how can the government say that it is not known when the process is clear that it cannot happen without the permission of the Defense Minister
 - atorni general kehete hai ki ofaset partner kaa faisla hone se pehle hi saude par dastakhat ho gaye the
 - We needed 36 aircraft immediately, so changed the deal
 supreme court ke faisle se hi pataa chalegaa ki ofaset partner ke liye deal badal di gai yaa phir vaaki jaldi vimaan chahie the iske liye deal badali gai
 On this, the petitioners say that between 2019 and 22 only planes will arrive
 saude ke saadhe teen saal ho gaye magar abhi tak ek bhi vimaan nahin aayaa he
 At the press conference of March 25, 2015, Dasso CEO said that the deal would be finalized soon
 saude ke 95 fisadi par sahmati ban gai he
 Through technology transfer, HAL will create many devices
 magar echeel saude se baahar ho gai
 No one was asked
 raksha mantri ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 The government knows that 36 aircraft is not enough for the Air Force, then why was it reduced from 126 to 36
 pradhanmantri ne kaise ghoshnaa kar di
 The deal was changed because the Prime Minister wanted to include Ambani
 ab ham aapako do video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 March 25, 2015, a month before the deal was signed and November 13, 2018, both belong to the same person
 dasso ke siio kaa
 On 25 March, the same person is taking the name of HAL, but is ani's Smita telling Prakash what he knew then, why he had taken the name of HAL
 aap bhi padhein
 
 
 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande
 siio kaa yah bayaan 25 march 2015 kaa he
 Twenty days before the agreement
 isamen aapane padhaa ki ve bol rahe hai ki echeel ke chairman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 The chairman has said that HAL is ready to shoulder the responsibilities associated with the deal
 ab ve 13 november ko kya kehete hai eenai kii smita prakaash se, wo bhi padhie
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the
 The deal was 126 aircraft
 ham echeel or bhartiya vayusena ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 i said about HAL, it's true
 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai
 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 supreme court main rafaal vimaan par teen baar sunwaayee ho chuki he
 The hearing lasted for about three and a half hours on 14 November
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii bench is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Joseph are also part of this bench

 - chif justise ne poocha ki to aapke paas koi guarantee nahin he? - The government says that this is a sensitive matter
 desh kii suraksha kaa maamla he
 After this there was a debate about the offset partner
 aap jaanate hai ki dasso ne ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko apana partner chunaa he
 According to the company, it has selected thirty companies including Ambani as partners
 is sawaal kaa sandarbh he ki deal hone ke kuch din pehle tak hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam iske liye tha, magar deal hone ke baad pataa chalata he ki ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko jagah mili he
 Rahul Gandhi is constantly alleging that Anil Ambani's company has been benefited
 ofaset partner ke sawaal par bhi sarkaar ne sikret rakhane kii sharton kaa hawala diya
 Prashant Bhushan raised questions
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki vah ofaset partner ke bare main nahin jaanati he jo tay kii gai prakriya ke khilaaf he
 Prashant Bhushan alleged that the process of fixing the offset was changed from the back date
 - atorni general ne kaha he ki guppatata kaa qaraar he to baaten gupt rakhni hi hongi
 - Justice m Joseph then asked what would happen if the offset partner ran away? - tab sarkaar ne kaha ki kantrect kii sharten ofaset partner par bhi lagu hoti hai
 - Prashant Bhushan said that how can the government say that it is not known when the process is clear that it cannot happen without the permission of the Defense Minister
 - atorni general kehete hai ki ofaset partner kaa faisla hone se pehle hi saude par dastakhat ho gaye the
 - We needed 36 aircraft immediately, so changed the deal
 supreme court ke faisle se hi pataa chalegaa ki ofaset partner ke liye deal badal di gai yaa phir vaaki jaldi vimaan chahie the iske liye deal badali gai
 On this, the petitioners say that between 2019 and 22 only planes will arrive
 saude ke saadhe teen saal ho gaye magar abhi tak ek bhi vimaan nahin aayaa he
 At the press conference of March 25, 2015, Dasso CEO said that the deal would be finalized soon
 saude ke 95 fisadi par sahmati ban gai he
 Through technology transfer, HAL will create many devices
 magar echeel saude se baahar ho gai
 No one was asked
 raksha mantri ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 The government knows that 36 aircraft is not enough for the Air Force, then why was it reduced from 126 to 36
 pradhanmantri ne kaise ghoshnaa kar di
 The deal was changed because the Prime Minister wanted to include Ambani
 ab ham aapako do video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 March 25, 2015, a month before the deal was signed and November 13, 2018, both belong to the same person
 dasso ke siio kaa
 On 25 March, the same person is taking the name of HAL, but is ani's Smita telling Prakash what he knew then, why he had taken the name of HAL
 aap bhi padhein
 
 
 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande
 siio kaa yah bayaan 25 march 2015 kaa he
 Twenty days before the agreement
 isamen aapane padhaa ki ve bol rahe hai ki echeel ke chairman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 The chairman has said that HAL is ready to shoulder the responsibilities associated with the deal
 ab ve 13 november ko kya kehete hai eenai kii smita prakaash se, wo bhi padhie
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the
 The deal was 126 aircraft
 ham echeel or bhartiya vayusena ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 i said about HAL, it's true
 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai
 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 iske baad ofaset partner ko lekar bahes chhidi
 You know that Dasso has chosen Anil Ambani's company as its partner as an offset partner
 company ke hisaab se usne ambani sahit tees companiyon ko partner chunaa he
 There is a reference to the question that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was named for it till a few days before the deal, but after the deal, it is known that Anil Ambani's company has got a place as an offset partner
 rahul gandhi lagaataar aarope laga rahe hai ki anil ambani kii company ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya he
 On the question of the offset partner, the government also cited the conditions of keeping secret
 prashanth bhushan ne sawaal uthaae
 - Prashant Bhushan said that the government says that it does not know about the offset partner which is against the procedure laid down
 - prashanth bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki ofaset tay karne kii prakriya badal kar back date se lagu kar di gai
 - The Attorney General has said that if there is an agreement of confidentiality, then things have to be kept secret
 - tab justise ke em joseph ne poocha ki agar ofaset partner bhaag gaya tab kya hoga? - Then the government said that the contract conditions also apply to the offset partner
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kaise kah sakati he ki pataa nahin jabaki prakriya se saaf he ki raksha mantri kii anumati ke bina nahin ho saktaa he
 - The Attorney General says that the deal was signed before the offset partner was decided
 - hamen 36 vimaan fouran chahie thi isliye deal badal di
 It will be known only by the decision of the Supreme Court that the deal was changed for the offset partner or if the aircraft was needed really quickly, the deal was changed for this
 is par yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki 2019 se 22 ke bich hi vimaan aaenge
 It has been three and a half years since the deal, but not a single aircraft has arrived yet
 25 march 2015 ke press conferes main dasso ke siio ne kaha ki deal jald final hogi
 95% of the deal has been agreed
 takanic transfar ke zarie echeel kai upkaran banayega
 But HAL pulled out of the deal
 kisi se nahin poocha gaya
 The Defense Minister did not even know
 sarkaar jaanati he ki airforce ke liye 36 vimaan kaaphi nahin he to phir 126 se ghataakar 36 kyon kiya gaya
 How did the Prime Minister declare
 deal isliye badali gai kyonki pradhanmantri ambani ko shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 Now we want to show you two videos
 25 march 2015 kaa yani deal hone ke ek maheenaa pehle kaa or 13 november 2018 kaa, donon ek hi shaks kaa he
 Of the CEO of Dasso
 25 march ko yahi shaks echeel kaa naam le rahaa he magar kya eenai kii smita prakaash ko bataa rahaa he ki use tab kya jaankaree thi, usne kyon echeel kaa naam liya tha

 Ajay Shukla has written a long report of three installments on Rafale prices in Business Standard
 jisamen daawa kiya he ki modi sarkaar ke samay jo qaraar hua he uske anusaar 40 pratishat adhik keemat di ja rahi he
 Let us know that Dasso CEO from ani's Smita Prakash has claimed that the deal is already 9 percent cheaper
 28 agast ko vitt mantri or purv raksha mantri arun jetali blog likhte he ki endie kii deal upie se 9 pratishat sasti he
 Jaitley is talking about 9 percent cheaper deals on basic aircraft

 The CEO of Dasson has said that the existing aircraft are 9 per cent cheaper but their reply does not indicate whether they are talking about basic aircraft or the price of aircraft equipped with India's needs according to Jaitley
 - sarkaar ne rafaal vimaan kii keemat silband lipaphe main supreme court ko saunpi he
 - Prashant Bhushan argued that price did not threaten national security
 - rafaal vimaan kii sari jaankariyaan saarvajanik hai
 - The price of Rafale aircraft has also been mentioned in Parliament
 - atarni general ne kaha ki sansad main bina hathiyaar va upkaran se las jet kii keemat bataai gai

 vaise 8 march ko india today se france ke raashtrapati maikron ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar chaahe to rafaal vimaan ke ditels vipaksh se saajha kar sakati he
 KK Venugopal said that if confidential information was made public without the knowledge of France, it would be a violation of the inter-governmental Agreement
 sarkaar ne rafaal deal ke nyaayik pareekshan kaa virodh kiya he
 KK Venugopal said that he too has not seen the sealed report
 isliye keemat ke bare main kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 - Chief Justice asked if the price was not disclosed in the old 2007 deal also? - kya us vakt bhi hathiyaaron va upkarnon kii jaankaree ko gopneey rakhaa gaya tha - The Attorney General said that was confidential even at that time
 is par prashanth bhushan ne hastkshep kiya or kuch report dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin tab chif justise ne kaha ki aapane vakt par ye report daakhil nahin kii

 a lot of questions are being answered even among journalists about this
 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the
 Modi was not the Prime Minister
 - julian- dasso kii tab mukesh ambani ke reliance group se baat ho rahi thi na ki anil ambani ke reliance group se

 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal

 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said: Dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance 
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the existing Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: "but the reliance at that time was different, it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different the French President was different , you are the only one who is common 
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance , within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company Now you will read this answer again
 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal
 eenai kii smita prakaash se siio trephiye kehete hai ki meri company clin he
 But in 1998 Dasso's director was sentenced to 18 months in the case of taking bribe
 usne kantrect lene ke liye 1998 main belgium ke netaaon ko rishwat di thi
 It will be known only by the decision of the Supreme Court that the deal was changed for the offset partner or if the aircraft was needed really quickly, the deal was changed for this
 is par yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki 2019 se 22 ke bich hi vimaan aaenge
 It has been three and a half years since the deal, but not a single aircraft has arrived yet
 25 march 2015 ke press conferes main dasso ke siio ne kaha ki deal jald final hogi
 95% of the deal has been agreed
 takanic transfar ke zarie echeel kai upkaran banayega
 But HAL pulled out of the deal
 kisi se nahin poocha gaya
 The Defense Minister did not even know
 sarkaar jaanati he ki airforce ke liye 36 vimaan kaaphi nahin he to phir 126 se ghataakar 36 kyon kiya gaya
 How did the Prime Minister declare
 deal isliye badali gai kyonki pradhanmantri ambani ko shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 Now we want to show you two videos
 25 march 2015 kaa yani deal hone ke ek maheenaa pehle kaa or 13 november 2018 kaa, donon ek hi shaks kaa he
 Of the CEO of Dasso
 25 march ko yahi shaks echeel kaa naam le rahaa he magar kya eenai kii smita prakaash ko bataa rahaa he ki use tab kya jaankaree thi, usne kyon echeel kaa naam liya tha

 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon

 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " On November 13, we are saying that as a supplier we wanted this deal
 deal 126 vimaanon kii thi
 We were working with HAL and the Indian Air Force
 maine echeel ke bare main kaha tha, yah sach he
 But they are not telling how HAL got out of the deal
 ve yah bhi nahin kah rahe hai ki echeel ke bare main unhone kaha to tha magar jab wo deal se baahar ho gai to sunakar hairaani hui
 His answer does not show much power

 The CEO of Dasson has said that the existing aircraft are 9 per cent cheaper but their reply does not indicate whether they are talking about basic aircraft or the price of aircraft equipped with India's needs according to Jaitley

 " On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande
 siio kaa yah bayaan 25 march 2015 kaa he
 Twenty days before the agreement
 isamen aapane padhaa ki ve bol rahe hai ki echeel ke chairman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 The chairman has said that HAL is ready to shoulder the responsibilities associated with the deal
 ab ve 13 november ko kya kehete hai eenai kii smita prakaash se, wo bhi padhie
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal

 " 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the
 The deal was 126 aircraft
 ham echeel or bhartiya vayusena ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 i said about HAL, it's true
 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai
 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 15 april 2015 ko pradhanmantri modi or purv raashtrapati oland ke bich qaraar hota he
 The ceo's statement is dated 25 March 2015

 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance , within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company Now you will read this answer again
 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal
 eenai kii smita prakaash se siio trephiye kehete hai ki meri company clin he
 But in 1998 Dasso's director was sentenced to 18 months in the case of taking bribe
 usne kantrect lene ke liye 1998 main belgium ke netaaon ko rishwat di thi
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the
 The deal was 126 aircraft
 ham echeel or bhartiya vayusena ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 i said about HAL, it's true
 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai
 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the

 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 - sarkaar ne rafaal vimaan kii keemat silband lipaphe main supreme court ko saunpi he
 - Prashant Bhushan argued that price did not threaten national security
 - rafaal vimaan kii sari jaankariyaan saarvajanik hai
 - The price of Rafale aircraft has also been mentioned in Parliament
 - atarni general ne kaha ki sansad main bina hathiyaar va upkaran se las jet kii keemat bataai gai
 - Without the approval of France, you cannot tell the price of a fully finished jet
 vaise 8 march ko india today se france ke raashtrapati maikron ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar chaahe to rafaal vimaan ke ditels vipaksh se saajha kar sakati he
 KK Venugopal said that if confidential information was made public without the knowledge of France, it would be a violation of the inter-governmental Agreement
 sarkaar ne rafaal deal ke nyaayik pareekshan kaa virodh kiya he
 KK Venugopal said that he too has not seen the sealed report
 isliye keemat ke bare main kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 - Chief Justice asked if the price was not disclosed in the old 2007 deal also? - kya us vakt bhi hathiyaaron va upkarnon kii jaankaree ko gopneey rakhaa gaya tha - The Attorney General said that was confidential even at that time
 is par prashanth bhushan ne hastkshep kiya or kuch report dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin tab chif justise ne kaha ki aapane vakt par ye report daakhil nahin kii
 There can no longer be a two-hour hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jab ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar rafaal vimaan kargil yuddh ke dauraan bharat ke paas hota to kai sainikon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 On this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi intervened to the Attorney General, saying that the Kargil war took place in 1999-2000 and the Rafale aircraft arrived in 2014
 is tarah ke bayaan mat dijie
 a lot of questions are being answered even among journalists about this
 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the
 Modi was not the Prime Minister

 It was a different company

 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 is par prashanth bhushan ne hastkshep kiya or kuch report dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin tab chif justise ne kaha ki aapane vakt par ye report daakhil nahin kii
 There can no longer be a two-hour hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jab ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar rafaal vimaan kargil yuddh ke dauraan bharat ke paas hota to kai sainikon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 On this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi intervened to the Attorney General, saying that the Kargil war took place in 1999-2000 and the Rafale aircraft arrived in 2014
 is tarah ke bayaan mat dijie
 a lot of questions are being answered even among journalists about this
 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the

 Controversy continues over the statement of Congress leader Saifuddin Soz on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir

 According to Raina, Saifuddin Soz and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad have links with lashkar-e-taiba chief Hafiz Saeed and jaish-e-mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar
 ravindra raina ne kaha, congressi netaaon ke is link kii vajah se hi aatank ke sargana inhen maanate hai
 In fact, the Congress is forging a grand alliance with Lashkar and Jaish
 taaki 2019 main modi ko haraaya ja sake
 At the same time, the Minister of State in PMO, Dr
 jitendra singh ne bhi safuddin soj or gulam nabi aaazaad par apni tikhi pratikriya di he
 He said, 'when they are in power, they call Kashmir an unwavering part of India and when they go out of power, then suddenly they get such knowledge
 jitendra singh ne aage kaha ki kashmir kaa aam yuva congress kii is prakaar kii dohari raajnneeti ko samajhane laga he
 He said, 'congress feels that they have no choice in front of Modi ji, hence making statements against the country
 jahaan tak gulam nabi aaazaad kii baat he to unhen faisla karnaa hoga ki vah lashkar ke saath hai yaa bharat ke saath
 In fact, Saifuddin Soz has supported the statement of former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in which he said that Kashmiris want independence
 soz kaa kahana he ki musharraf kaa ek dashak pehle diya gaya ye bayaan aaj bhi kai myanon main thik baithta he
 However, he also said that getting this freedom is not possible
 mere bayanon kaa party se lenaa-dena nahin he
 The controversy has arisen since Soz's statement
 ajtak ke saath baatcheet main unhone baar-baar is baat par jor diya ki kashmir main agar shanti sthapit kerani he to har kisi se baat kerani hogi
 He also supported talking to separatist leaders
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki is bayaan kaa unki party congress se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Saifuddin Sojan said that Kashmiri people do not want to come with Hindustan nor with Pakistan, they all want independence
 lekin ye aazaadee naammumkin he
 Let us tell you that Saifuddin Soz is bringing a book on Kashmir issue called Kashmir: Glimpses of History and the Story of Struggle
 ye kitaab agle hafte release hogi

 The notion that India can play the role of a country challenging China has always been more imaginary than ground reality
 digar he ki asian (eyesieen) ke das sadasyon main se bahut-se deshon kaa china ke saath samudri seemaa ko lekar vivaad he, khaskar vietnam or philippines ke saath
 But these reasons are not stopping any country from going deep into the economic circle of China
 pichley saal asian deshon ke saath china kaa vyapaar kareeb 350 arab dollar tha, jabaki bharat kaa 60 arab dollar se bhi kam rahaa
 It is common opinion among officials in Manila and Jakarta that they have a very good image of India — based on historical and cultural contacts — but have not been able to take advantage of it
 east asia summit or 25wein bharat-asian summit ke liye 12 november ko jab pradhanmantri narendra modi manila jaaenge to isi pahalu ko badalane kii koshish karenge
 The Manmohan Singh government was somewhat emboldened in India's "look East" policy and in 2009 entered into an agreement called the asean-india Free Trade Area

 The Modi government has reformed this policy for a larger purpose and changed it to "work in the East"
 pradhanmantri ne asian ke sabhi 10 netaaon ko janvari main ganatantr diwas kii parade dekhne ke liye aamantrit kiya he
 The Modi government is working fast on the construction of the 3,200 km-long moreh-india-myanmar-thailand highway, which was conceived in 2002

 (beijing is already working on a project to run a bullet train from Kunming connecting Bangkok and Singapore)
 sabase bada badlaav yah he ki modi sarkaar ne akele ''purab main kaam karne" kii apni simaaon ko samajha
 Modi does not appear to be hesitant to lean towards Tokyo and Washington in terms of building his relationship with the region and is not paying much heed to China's sentiments
 yah tarkpurna bhi najar aa rahaa he
 Looking at asean's relations with Japan and America, the region seems to be less dependent on China
 bharat, japan (239 arab dollar) or america (212 arab dollar) ke saath is kshetra kaa kul vyapaar china ke saath kul vyapaar kaa dedh guna he

 It will now be seen whether this proximity will be limited to the matter of security cooperation or will become China's economic option
 beijing is badlaav ko gaur se dekh rahaa he
 In Xi Jinping's first term, Beijing had no competitors
 usne tab dakshin china sagar main ''dweep nirmaan" jaisi gatividhiyon ke saath apni sainya takat ko majboot kiya tha or apni kushal kootneeti se asian deshon kii sanyukt koshish ko naakaam kar diya tha
 He also improved his relations with the Philippines and worked towards bridging the rift with Vietnam
 saath hi apana vyapaar bhi badhaata rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, Donald Trump had distanced himself from the trans-pacific Partnership Agreement as a first step when he formed his government
 yah samjhauta yah china ke aarthik dabadabe kaa jawaab dene kii disha main ab tak kaa sabase bada prayaas tha
 There is general consensus in Beijing that Trump will ultimately prove to be India's non-trusted partner
 beijing ke pramukh ranneetikaar shen dingli kehete hai, ''trump kii indo-pacific ranneeti se koi phayda nahin hone vaala he
 The indo-pacific has always been free and open
 samandaron ko baanta nahin ja saktaa
 China is the player of the Indian Ocean, and the Indian Ocean belongs to no one, be it China, India or America

 agle saal safal rashtramandal khelon ke aayojan ko lekar behad dabaav jhel rahe aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh suresh kalmari ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne unhen alag thalag nahin kiya he or unhen apane pad se istipha dene kaa koi kaaran najar nahin aata
 There was a confrontation between the organizing committee and the CGF over the last few months after the differences became public with Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) President Michael Fennell and Chief Executive Mike Hooper
 kalmari ne haalanki daawa kiya ki sabhi masale sulajhaa liye gayi hai or unhen bharat sarkaar se puraa samarthan mil rahaa he
 He rejected the fact that he was isolated in some new appointments to the organizing committee
 unhone kaha 'main aapako spasht kar duun ki sarkaar meraa puraa samarthan kar rahi he, sabhi adhikari mere aagrah ke baad hi niyukt kiye gayi hai or maine sena ke bhi kai logon ko khelon se jodne ke liye kaha he
 Kalmadi said, 'about 50 people are joining the army and we have asked public enterprises, private sectors and the government to give it to the people as well, they will do the same thing that they can do
 isliye mujhe khushi he ki ve hamase jud rahe hai

 Doubt is being raised over Kalmadi's leadership ability for the successful holding of the Games but the IOA chief said that he would not resign from his post
 unhone kaha, 'istipha dene kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 These games have been hosted by the Indian Olympic Association and the IOA is doing very well
 khelon ke aayojan main ab keval aath maheene kaa samay bachaa he or istipha dene kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 We are organizing these games and these will be the best games ever

 Kalmadi also said that he did not bow down to Fennel's demands
 iske bajaay donon pakshon ne sweekaarya formule par kaam kiya haalanki unhone iske bare main vistaar se nahin bataaya
 Kalmadi said, this is not right
 main is par aage koi tippanee bhi nahin karnaa chahta hum
 For both sides, it has been like giving with one hand and taking it from the other and we have reached an agreement
 'kalmari se jab poocha gaya ki kya ve nirmaan kaaryon kii pragati ke liye swatantra panel gathit karne kii fennell kii maang se sahamat the to unhone is masale par baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 He said 'I do not want to talk on this issue because it has been resolved
 iske liye samanvay ayog he or iske aane ke baad hi sabhi faisle kiye jaaenge
 We will have another meeting with Fennell in which all these things will be decided
 ' kalmari ne haalanki sweekaar kiya ki fennell kii maang ke anuroop adhik videshi visheshgyon kii niyukti kii gayi lekin saaf kiya ki ve unheen kshetron se jude hai jinamein bharat ko visheshgyata hasil nahin he

 The Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister had met the BSP chief the previous night
 vah rajyasabha main matdaan se baahar rahane kii yojana bana rahi thim
 The meeting between Mayawati, BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra and Kamal Nath lasted till midnight
 agali subah gahare nile rang kaa safari suut pahane kamalnath sansad main aatmavishvaas se bhare lambey-lambey dag bharte hue aae
 The bsp's vote was safely in his pocket and he conveyed this good news to the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri ke alaava yah baat sirf sonia gandhi hi jaanati thim ki unhone vot apane paale main kar liye hai
 National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah told India Today, "I don't think anyone else could have done what Kamal Nath has done
" vah aadhi raat tak mashkkat karte rahe or koi nahin jaanata tha ki vah kya kar rahe hai
 "the opposition, which had been telling journalists until a few minutes ago that the government would lose on the FDI vote, was virtually asleep
 yah chakit karne vaala or kamalnath ke siyaasi kaushal kii dhak jamaane vaala kshan tha
 Although the UPA had won the Lok Sabha elections on December 5, but Kamal Nath knew that Rajya Sabha mps could pose more risks
 upie ke liye yah jaruri tha ki bispi yaa samaajawaadee party (sapa) sarkaar ke paksh main vot karen, na ki matdaan se baahar chale jaaen jaisaa ki ve nichle sadan main kar chuke hai
 That is why he quickly moved towards Mayawati's house
 bispi kii netaa ne sadan main kaha, ''yadi vipaksh kaa prastaav (epadi ke khilaaf) aage badhata he to sadan ko baadhit karne ke liye ek or raajnneetik masalaa mil jayega or nijee kshetra kii naukariyon main essi / asti ko aarakshan jaise kai mahatvapurn bill paarit nahin ho paaenge
 '' Kamal Nath is not able to present the case in such a better way
 mayawati ke baad eiediemke netaa ve maitreyan ne niraash hokar kaha, ''yadi sarkaar jitati he to yah pantarebaaji kii jeet hogi
 After the victory in the Rajya Sabha, Kamal Nath pushed the SC / ST bill to Parliament in the weekend
 pradhanmantri ko aakhirkaar pranab mukherjee kii jagah nayaa sankatmochak mil hi gaya
 The then Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal was not that weighty leader
 isi tarah pichley agast main mukherjee kii jagah sadan ke nae netaa bane susheel kumaar scindia bhi beasar the
 Manmohan Singh needed a person who, like Mukherjee, could negotiate political with every party and had a good grasp of economics

 The Prime Minister knew that he would have to look beyond this enchanting circle
 iske baad najar kamalnath par gai, jo ki upie 2 ke kaarykaal main zyaadaatar samay upekshit hi rahe the
 In terms of victory, 66-year-old Kamal Nath is among the most senior leaders of the Lok Sabha
 is maamle main bas sipii (em) netaa basudeb acharya hi unase aage hai
 Kamal Nath is an old Congressman who emerged from the Youth Congress of the era of Sanjay Gandhi
 ve mayawati ko kanshiram ke jamaane se jaanate hai
 During the time of Indira Gandhi in 1980, she talked to the DMK for an alliance and in 2004 she was also instrumental in connecting the DMK to the UPA
 unhone mamata banerjee ko sadak par sangharsh karne vaali ek saahsee netaa se mukhyamantri banate dekha he or odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ke saath to unhone skool kii padhai kii he
 When Kamal Nath calls a colleague, he knows which tone will work
 vah nishchit rup se apane pehle floor test main paas ho gaye hai
 The victory of FDI has not only raised the profile of Nath, but also encouraged the government
 isse upie ko apane sudhaar agenda ko lagu karne ke liye bal mila he
 In addition to the bill raising the FDI limit in insurance, on which the BJP and Congress are yet to resolve their differences, the government is confident that it will be able to push the economic reforms bills in the coming budget session
 ab congress main feel-good kaa maahaul he, jo ki sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr kii shuruyaat ke pehle din nahin dikh rahaa tha
 Even the opposition's latest allegations of bribes by Walmart have not dampened the party's enthusiasm
 nath ne tatkaal hi is maamle main jaanch kii ghoshnaa kar vipaksh ke dank ko beasar kar diya, jabaki chidambaram or kapil sibbal jaise unki party ke kai netaa sachet kar rahe the ki isse global niveshkon main galat sandesh jayega
 An upbeat Kamal Nath is not in the mood to steal from a confrontation
 unhone sheetakaaleen satr kii shuruyaat se pehle hi acchhee tarah se jamini daud laga lee thi or apana homework kar liya tha, pradhanmantri ko is baat ke liye manaaya tha ki ve sapa netaa mulaayam singh yadav or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav, mayawati or bijepi netaaon ko alag-alag dinar or lunch ke liye aamantrit karen
 For the first time, the coalition parties and the main opposition party were called separately seeking support and no all-party meeting or UPA was held
 sapa ke saath 9 november ke dinar main hi nath ne ek or sahyogi dal tathaa puraane mitra farukh abdulla ko bhi aamantrit kar liya tha
 The idea behind this was that Yadav leaders should use a Muslim face to understand the benefits of FDI
 kamalnath ne sapa or basapa donon ko yah samajha diya ki dukandaar lobby bijepi ke prati patibaddh he, isliye epadi ko samarthan dene se unke vot bank par koi asar nahin padegaa
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj gave the most fitting honor to Kamal Nath, who was unintentional, when he said in the House, "only four of the 18 parties that i spoke to have supported FDI in retail
" '' iske baavjood upie matdaan main jeet gai
 BJP should not be concerned with Kamal Nath's arithmetic but his algebra
 kamalnath ke sansad main is tarah ke floor sho ko dekhne ke baad ek cabinet mantri ne hansate hue kaha, ''hamane unhen pehle sansadeey kaary mantri banane ko kyon nahin sochaa? '' congress mahasachiv digvijay singh kehete hai, ''kamalnath aise vyakti hai, jinhen aap nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 If they are assigned a task, they complete it
 pichley kuch dinon main unki samajhane-boojhne kii takat or netwarking kaushal, donon sabit ho chuke hai
 "so far, Kamal Nath had got important ministries, but not top ministries
 unhen is baat kaa malaal to rahaa hi hoga ki unke mukaable sibbal jaise nae netaa ko raajnneetik maamalon kii cabinet cameti main unase pehle hi shaamil kar liya gaya
 But gradually, Manmohan Singh has come to understand that the government can be pulled out of the current crisis not by Kapil Sibal or Salman Khurshid's arguing skills, but by Kamal Nath's political skills

 The BJP leader also said that the people of Purvanchal will not forgive Arvind Kejriwal as he was forced to make Sanjay Singh the election in-charge

 Ever since Arvind Kejriwal's statement, the Bharatiya Janata Party has been continuously attacking the Delhi government, saying that Arvind Kejriwal wants all the people from Purvanchali and outside Delhi to leave the capital
 bijepi ne shuru kiya no tu single yuj plastic campankendriya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat, bijepi netaa vijay goyal ne diziner ritu beri ke saath rajeev chowk metro stesan par no tu single yuj plastic campan kii shuruyaat kii
 For this, a selfie point was made at Rajiv Chowk metro station where an effigy made of plastic bottles was erected

 In the Narela area of outer Delhi, the case of mistreatment with the activist of the Delhi Commission for Women has now taken a political color
 lokanayak jai prakaash narayan hospital (LNJP) main bhartee dilli mahila ayog kii kaaryakarta se milane pahunche mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne is puure maamle main dilli police par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Kejriwal will talk to LG After meeting the woman suffering in the hospital, CM Kejriwal said that he will meet Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on this issue
 mahila kaaryakarta par hue gambhir hamale ke baad sabase bada sawaal sthaneey police par khadaa ho rahaa he
 Kejriwal said that when the illegal liquor was being sold in that area for a long time, why did the local police not take action? When Kejriwal was asked questions on the responsibility of Excise Department, he said that the Commissioner of Excise Department has been called
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne bhidilli policeko saman bheja he
 In conversation till date, he said that Delhi Police should take responsibility for this
 narela main jis ghar main sharaab bikri ho rahi thi wo police ke malkhane ke bilkul paas he
 Despite this, the sale of liquor and marijuana is illegal
 isamen zimmedaari dilli police kii bhi or aabkaari vibhaag kii bhi he

 Renowned litterateur, editor and children's favorite writer Prakash Manu has done many works and enriched the literary world in the span of many decades
 unke lekhan main sansmaran, shodh, saakshaatkaar, katha, kavita, lekh aadi shaamil hai
 The life of this famous Hindi litterateur and children's favorite writer Prakash Manu has gone through a lot of mess, bumpy paths and trails
 un dhul bhare raaston se guzarate hue unhone jivan ke marm ko samajha he, to saath hi bhartiyata, bhartiya samskruti or paramparaon ke mul utsa ko bhi, jisane unhen bheetar se nimajjit kiya or dhire-dhire ve lekhak hone kii raah par bade
 'my Autobiography: Rastes and Trails' is the first volume of Prakash Manu's autobiography, which recounts his childhood, adolescence and the passionate movements of Tarunai
 unhone badi gahan samvednaa ke saath ek ore apane shishav kii abodhta or aatmaleenta ko dekha he, to duusari ore ek-ek kadam aage badhaate bachapan ko, jiske saath anginat kisse-kahaniyaan or smritiyon ke na jane kitne dhaage lipte hue hai
 But at the same time, he has also fondly remembered mother, father, siblings, friends of that era, his dear teachers and other souls whose deceitful memories are scattered throughout this autobiography
 jaahir he, prakaash manu apni aatmakatha main akele nahin hai, balki isamen unke jivan kaa puraa pravaah he, samay he, paramparaayen hai or unke bich anayas hi bahut kuch nayaa bhi nirmit ho rahaa he
 In this way, 'my Autobiography: Pathways and Trails' is a story of Prakash Manu as well as his time
 ho saktaa he, is aatmakatha main bahut badi ghatnaayen na hon, par baarik samvednaa or smritiyon ke dhaage puri aatmakatha main bikhare hai
 Manu ji has molded them neatly and molded them into a big story which has no end
 isliye yah aatmakatha sach puuchhie to jivan kii kahani he, jivan ke khule vistaar kii kahani he, jisamen har adhyay kaa apana alag ras, rang or swaad he
 'my Autobiography: Rastes and Trails' is also the story of Prakash Manu being the author
 bachapan se hi ve auron se alag the or choti-choti chizon par ghanton sochate rahete the
 He was very much interested in stories and he used to weave dreams by flying on the wings of the story, dreams of changing this world and doing something
 shaayad isi cheez ne unhen lekhak banaaya or jivan kaa ek alag rasta chunane ke liye bheetar-baahar se taiyaar kiya
 Years ago a literary friend asked him the question, 'prakash Manu ji, how did you become a writer? What was around you that was making you a writer? ' Perhaps the answer is also an autobiography
 Hope is, readers of Prakash Manu Ji spread in every corner of the country will get creative satisfaction and satisfaction from this autobiography
 saath hi sahitya-jagat main iskaa utsaah se swaagat hoga
 Remember that the novels in his famous works published before this autobiography; Story compilation in addition to 'this is Delhi', 'katha Circus', 'after Papa leaves'; 'won't Wish Uncle', 'socrates in my city', 'arundhati is sad', 'zindaginama of a genius',' Where are you Naveen Bhai ',' Mrs
 Majumdar ',' Mini Bus', 'dilawar stands ',' Meri Shrestha Kahani ',' Meri Thirty One Stories', '21 Shrestha Kahani', 'popular Stories of Prakash Manu' and 'meri katha-yatra'
 prakaash manu ne katha sahitya ke alaava kavitaayen, sansmaran, saakshaatkaar, aalochana or saahityetihaas se sambandhit vicharottejak lekhan se bhi hindi sahitya ko samrudh kiya
 His poetry collection; Printed as 'another Prayer', 'quitting House', 'between Kavita and Kavita', the book 'meet' was a much talked about long, informal interview of Hindi litterateurs
 ‘yaadon kaa kaaravaan’ main hindi ke sheersh sahitkaaron ke sansmaran
 Critical evaluative books on the personality and literary contributions of Devendra Satyarthi, Ram Vilas Sharma, Shailesh Matiani, Ramdarash Mishra and Vishnu Khare
 sahitya academy ke liye devendra satyaarthee or vishnu prabhakar par monograph ke alaava satyaarthee ji kii sampurna jeevani ‘devendra satyaarthee: ek safarnama’ prakaashan vibhaag se prakashit hui
 Also 'novel at the end of the twentieth century: a reader's notes' in criticism is a different kind of book
 prakaash manu ke vishaal rachana-sansar main bal sahitya kii sau se adhik pustaken shaamil hai, jinhen bacchon or bal sahitya ke adhyetaon se khub saraahna mili
 Such compositions include the collection of large children's literature like 'meri Sampoorna Bal Kahaniyan' (three volumes), 'meri Sampoorna Bal Kavita' and 'mere Sampoorna Bal Natak' (two volumes)
 unhone hindi main bal sahitya kaa pehla vyavasthit itihaas ‘hindi bal sahitya kaa itihaas’ likhaa
 Apart from this, wrote 'history of Hindi children's poetry', 'shikhar personality of Hindi children's literature', 'creator of Hindi children's literature' and 'hindi children's literature: New challenges and possibilities'
 unhone kai mahatvapurn pustakon kaa sampadan va sanchayan kiya
 Many of his books have been translated into other Indian languages including Punjabi, Sindhi, Marathi, Kannada
 ek khaas baat yah bhi ki prakaash manu kaa mul naam chandraprakash wig he, par sarkari dastavejon ko chhod den, to shaayad hi unka yah naam kahin prachlan main ho
 Manu wrote with the same name and also won many awards
 vah apane bal upanyaas ‘ek tha thunthuniya’ par sahitya academy ke pehle bal sahitya puraskaar se navaaje gaye
 Apart from this, Uttar Pradesh Hindi Institute's 'bal Sahitya Bharati Award' and Hindi Academy's 'sahityakar Samman' were also honored
 kavita-sangrah ‘chhutata hua ghar’ ke liye unhen pratham girijakumar maathur smriti puraskaar bhi mila tha
 The first volume of his autobiography published on Sahitya Aaj Tak: Part of his autobiography: 'my Autobiography: Rastes and Trails'
 Excerpts: i remember her mother's eyes - Prakash Manumaan, first of all i miss her eyes
 wein ankhen jinamein ek bachche kaa-sa bholaapan tha or jaanane-samajhane kii anwarat jigyaasa
 That is why, if we used to say even a simple thing to our own mother, the mother's eager eyes would spread
 thodi der tak apane ‘saamaanya gyaan’ se ve use samajhane kii koshish karatin or phir agle hi pal chakit swar main kah uthati, "hachha
 
 
 ! "that's why there was no structure in life when there was a mother, there was no complexity or discomfort in life
 jivan main koi dar nahin tha
 Mother was mother, so was the sea of faith
 jivan vahaan thaathen martha
 Some time ago García was reading Gabrielle Marques's interview in 'kathadesh', which has been beautifully translated by Manglesh Dabral
 usamen khaskar striyon ko lekar unhone kuch adbhut baaten kahi hai
 One of them is also that it is women who hold on to life
 yah jivan ko thame rahanaa kya he or striyaan yah kaam kaise karti hai? is par gaur karte hue mujhe maan kii yaad ai
 How they connected our entire house with a fine, very fine and invisible wire, and how much of that fine wire was scattered and disintegrated! If i remember this, then i remember a lot of being a mother
 yon maan ko lekar duniya kii tamaam bhashaaon ke sahitya, khaskar lok sahitya main kuch kam nahin kaha gaya
 Satyarthi, our nomadic litterateur with long beard and vivacity, often used to repeat an old saying that God created mothers, because he could not be present everywhere
 mujhe lagata he ki maan ko lekar isse badi koi baat shaayad hi kahi ja sakati ho
 The truth is that i also trust God because i have seen mother
 lagata he, jisane meri maan ko banaaya, vah sachmuch kuch na kuch hoga! vah sachmuch mahaan hoga! jivan main vishwaas, aasthaa, bhadrata or na jane koun-koun si acchhee chijen isiilie hai kyonki maan he or uskaa hona hamaare puure jivan main vyaapt he, uske na rahane par bhi!satyaarthee ji ke jis vichaar kii upar charchaa kii he, vah unke upanyaas ‘doodh-gachh’ kaa to kendriya vichaar yaa ‘signechar tun’ hi he
 Another interesting thing is that in the novel 'doodh-gachh', milk-gach has come for the mother itself, that is, the mother who is also a 'milk tree' - the show of milk grown to satisfy the whole world! This imagination is really unique
 is duniya main maan kaa hona bhi to sachmuch aisa hi anokhaa he
 If there was no mother, this world would not have been so beautiful, neither unique nor so fine, layer-by-layer full of mysteries! There has been some consciousness
 lekin maan kaa hona tab bhi mahasoos hota tha
 Mother's words still sounded good
 shaayad isliye ki ye baaten sirf baaten nahin thim
 She was a nest of cute straws, with hidden heads, escaping from the many pangs around, i was slowly growing up
 maan jab padosinon or saheliyon se batiyaa rahi hoti thim, to mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he, ek nanhe, utsuk bachche ke rup main meraa ghuskar us mandali main baithna or gaur se maan kii baaten sunanaa
 Kukku was my household name in childhood
 pyaar se pukaarane kaa naam
 So mother and friends often used to barge out laughing with sarcastic laughter that "O Kukku! What are you listening to? Do you understand what these women say!" My cuckoo hoya c
 
 
 !’ yaa ‘jis vele meraa shyaam hoya
 
 
 ! ' Ya mera 'mera kishan, Jagan hale chota-ji si
 
 
 !’ or tab kya-kya sankat aae yaa kya-kya ascharyajanak chijen ghatit huin, vahi sab un akath kahaniyon kaa saar tha jinhen ‘auraton kii baaten’ kaha jaataa tha
 i could talk about them to my fellow women for hours, and how long summer afternoons and evenings got entangled in the trap of these simple things of happiness and sorrow, i still find myself It seems like a surprise! And it seems equally surprising that a little child was so interested in me that i could understand or not understand things, but she did not come to an end
 
 or main ankhen failaae hue ekatak un baton ko sunata, balki peetaa tha
 What was of interest to me was that they were mother's words! But when Mother and her friends used to see me listening so intently, i used to laugh and interrupt, "come on and on! Don't listen to me!" (come on, move away
 tum kya sun rahe ho!)bahut chhutpan kii smriti
 Mother puts a large bundle of clothes on her head, is going to wash clothes on the pond and i am together
 maan talab ke kinare pade pathar par ragad-ragadkar kapade dho rahi hai or main kheton kii med par uge pile-pile sundar vanphool todane or aasapaas daud lagane main magan hoon
 Little was known in those days, but things used to be felt
 masalan sardiyon kii gunguni dhoop main daudane-bhaagane or khilne kaa sukh kya he, yah khub acchhee tarah mahasoos karata tha or prakruti kii antarang sundarataa ko bhi! man to utsaah se bharaa hua-sa pukaarata tha, "are vaah, talab ke aasapaas ke kheton main sarson kya khub lahak-lahakakar ugi he! or sarson ke pile-pile phool hi nahin, uski gandh bhi chaaron ore ek jhaalar-si rachakar, aasapaas ke puure maahaul ko maano ek adbhut utsav main dhaal rahi he
 "remember, that day, at the age of four years, i felt the infinite extent of nature
 laga, meraa hriday falkar bahut bada ho gaya he or usamen bahut kuch samaata chalaa ja rahaa he
 Even the whole pond, the surrounding fields and the yellow shrubs with wild flowers
 yah ek shishu ke man main janami shaayad pehali nanhee kavita thi
 Another old but darker picture
 maan ek dolu main gud ke shire main duboi hui doiyaan (aate kii choti-choti tikadiyaan) liye, talab ke paas ‘gugga’ yani ‘goga pir’ yaa phir kahie gram devtaa ko poojane ja rahi hai or main saath hoon
 After the puja, the dough is dipped in molasses molasses and i think, there is nothing more delicious in the world
 main mangekar or doiyaan letaa hoon
 Mother puts a lot of molasses and two pieces in my bowl and i think, how beautiful and tasty the world really is! Remember, Mother used to repeat a few lines while taking a bath
 inamen ye do panktiyaan jarur hoti thim, "gange mel-mel nahie, stri da janam kadi na pie
 
 
 ! "mother used to repeat these lines again and again, as if repeating them again and again sounds like a 'liberation assurance' to her
 stri kaa jivan kshtakaari he, par use badalane ke bajaay bas prarthana kerani chahie, shaayad yahi bas maan ke hisse kaa ‘sach’ rahaa hoga! is sach kii seemaa ho sakati he par is sach ko saakaar karne kii maan kii sadhana kii koi seemaa nahin thi
 Thus, mother's life was not dissolved with sorrow, despair or inferiority of any kind
 ve cameri thim or har din utsaah se nae din kaa swaagat karti thim
 i miss a winter morning more than half a century old
 ham log tab chote-chote the
 After getting up at very early dawn, we were still in bed that Mother used to gently chant a song like a bird
 or ham anjaane hi use dohraane lagate the
 There was really a lot of sweetness in these songs and it seemed like a sweet and cheerful dawn welcome song - woke up early in the morning! Guran da meditation, Ganga Ishanan
 hath wich lotaa,modhe loi,ram ji di gauaansita di rasoi
 
 
 ! (get up, wake up early in the morning
 guruon kaa dhyaan or ganga-snaan karo
 Lotus in hand and shoulder on shoulder
 ram ji gauen charaa rahe hai or maan sita rasoi taiyaar kar rahi hai
 ) What was the song, as if the ideal of Hindustani marriage was put in front
 ek karmleen jivan kaa sidhaa-sada chitra
 
 
 
 kaaphi lanbaa geet tha
 Slowly, he moved forward in a smooth, relaxed rhythm of great comfort
 or isi main aage chalakar ek pankti aati thi jo mujhe badi pyaari lagati thi, "chidiyaan ve chunagun laayaa i, uth, jaag savere!!" (chidiyon ne bhi chunagun kaa raag ched diya he
 Get up very early in the morning
 )isi tarah yaad padataa he ki gayatri mantra bhi mujhe pehlepahal maan se hi sunne ko mila
 Rather one morning of winter, Mother in her sweet, kharkhari voice reminded me this mantra well
 aaj jab ki naanaa ji ke asaadhaaran vyaktitv ke bare main kashmiri bhaisahab se kaaphi kuch sun chukaa hoon, main kalpana kar saktaa hoon ki mere vidwaan naanaa ji ne kaise maan ko yah gayatri mantra yaad karaayaa hoga! or jab maan se vahi mantra kisi jaadui prabhaav se mujh tak aa gaya to maano maan ke rup main naanaa ji hi vah mantra mujhe yaad kara rahe the! jivan ke vikaas kaa yahi to shaashvat mantra he
 And the more simple it is, the more mysterious it is! * i remember the stories of my mother very well
 inamen ek to ‘adhaku’ vaali kahani thi, jiskaa mujh par khaasaa asar padaa tha
 However, i could not remember the story as it was
 is kahani ko maine thodaa alag rup dekar apni bal kahaniyon kii pustak ‘ikyavan bal kahaniyaan’ main shaamil kiya he
 Recently, the Kashmiri brother had been reading this book of my children's stories and was discussing this story, then suddenly he lost his great laughter
 jaahir he, is kahani ko padhate-padhate ve bhi meri tarah apane bachapan kii seedhiyaan utarkar bachapan ke jaadui sansar main chale gaye honge! shaayad yahi asar hota he, bachapan main maan se suni hui kahaniyaan kaa
 Similarly, one of the stories heard from mother was the story of seven rooms
 rajkumaar se kaha jaataa he ki vah is mahal kii chah kothriyaan dekh le, lekin saatvin nahin
 Otherwise, he will get into trouble
 rajkumaar chah kothriyaan dekhtaa he, lekin phir saatvin kothri dekhne se bhi khud ko roak nahin paata
 Let it happen, but once i will see what is in the seventh room? He thinks jid thaan letaa he
 And indeed with the entry into the seventh room, the difficulties are broken one after the other like a fierce storm, water, storm - or a fierce clawed vulture
 par vah himmat nahin harata, bahaduree se unhen jhelta he or aakhir ek din safalataa ke unche shikhar par khadaa hua najar aata he
 
 
 
 maan se yah kahani sunate hue lagata tha ki chaahe jo ho, main bhi saatvin kothri main jaakar dekhuungaa ki vahaan bhala koun-sa rahasy chipa hua he
 Then whether i live or die! i may not have thought then, but now i wonder many times - so is it to enter the world of literature to peek into the seventh room where secrets are full of secrets and 'dangers' of their own kind? i wonder and am filled with wonder that the same story, if it is truly lived and heard, can open up so many different intentions for so many people
 bachapan main suni kahaniyon kii shaayad yahi takat bhi he
 Perhaps our mothers have been feeding us the mantra of winning good over evil for centuries! Even if the social scientists who read 'english' very much have not understood its significance right now, and for me it is like an extra pleasure that mother is hidden in her stories
 jab chaha, vahaan jaakar unhen dekh or sun liya
 
 
 
 maan kii sunai kahaniyon main do-ek kahaniyaan aisi bhi thim jinke jariye maan shaayad apane maan hone yaa stri hone kii takalif ko hamaare saath baantna chaahati thim yaa kahie ki ek kism kaa paath padhaanaa chaahati thim
 In one of these stories, the son, who is now earning a good income, wants to pay the mother's sacrifice when she grows up
 vah baar-baar poochta he, "bol na maan, main tere liye kya laaun?" maan chup rahati he
 When asked a lot, she laughs and says, "let me leave the son, why suffer?" When the son insists, the mother finally says that the good son will say when the time comes
 usee raat ko betaa soya to maan ne uski khaat par lote se jaraa-sa pani daal diya
 The boy got up in a hurry
 poocha, "maan
 
 
 Mother, what is this? "mother said," i don't know how the son fell from me
 khayr, tu pareshaan na ho, so ja!"ladke ko neend ai hi thi ki maan ne phir pani gira diya
 Now he got annoyed badly
 chillaakar bolaa, "maan, aaj tu mujhe sone degi ki nahin?" is par maan ne bade mamtalu swar main kaha, "chaiyn se so bete, par ek baat yaad rakh
 When you were small, do not know how many times you used to urinate at night
 par main tuje sookhe main sulaati thi, khud geele main so jaati thi
 Never used to get angry
 par tu to betaa, do baar main hi pareshaan ho gaya
 So, how will you repay my mother's debt? ”hearing the story, there was a lot of anger on the son who had to face the mother in a little while
 maine sochaa, main to aisa betaa nahin banunga
 But could i really be a good son? Today, i feel ashamed of myself
 maan kii kai kahaniyon main adbhut phantasy bhi thi
 For example, a story of the mother was the story of that amazing 'primitive' world thousands of years ago, in which people took their heads off like a pot and kept lice
 khaskar striyon ko chaiyn se juen binane kaa avasar mil jaataa tha
 Sitting in the sun, keep lice in fun
 lekin phir ek gadabadjhaalaa ho gaya
 Really weird mess! It has happened that while doing this, a woman forgot to place her head somewhere in the domestic busy and engaged in other things
 peeche se bandar aayaa or uske sir ko uthaa le gaya
 Now that woman is looking for her head here and there, but the head is not found
 phir pataa chalaa ki sir to saamne ped par baithe hue bandar ke paas he jo bahut minnaten karne ke baad bamushkil use dene ko raji hua
 From that day onwards, God changed his creation and since then everyone's head started getting fixed
 
 
 
 Mother's naive truth of the naive world! However, it was such a fun fantasy to pick up lice by putting your head in the dock like a wolf that we would laughed while laughing
 or aaj bhi jab is kalpana ke bare main sochataa hoon, to hansee aae bagaiyr nahin rahati
 Similarly, there was a funny story of 'githmuthie'
 kalpana kaa ek or ashcharyalok! kyonki yah kahani bhi ek adbhut duniya main rahane vaale adbhut praaniyon kii thi
 Githmuthey means those who stand, if they are a 'gith', they are full of ballists, and if they sit, they are a handful! Such people used to come out of Hades and come to Earth and then what would not happen! But one thing was certain that these were not bad people
 bhale praani the jo musiibat main dharti ke vaasiyon kii madad karne aate the
 Later i read all the stories about dwarves in the indigenous and foreign fairy tales
 bahut si to grim bandhuon kii parikthaon main bhi hai
 Most of the fairy tales written about dwarfs are very interesting, but none of them are as fun as kink
 ho saktaa he, maan ne bhi yah kahani bachapan main apni maan se suni ho
 In this sense, the Indian tradition of fairytales is also not entirely new
 or usamen agar lokkathaon ko bhi jod liya jaae, tab to yah parampara sadiyon puraani thaharti he
 It is not that there is no reality in the stories of the mother, but fantasy was mixed in that expression of reality
 mujhe yaad padataa he, maan kii ek haroonges kahani ‘bhukh’ ko lekar thi or ise ve gandhari se jodatii thim
 Gandhari's hundred sons were killed in the Mahabharata war
 shok ke maare uskaa bura haal tha
 After Gandhari cries a lot, Krishna consults him and asks him to abandon mourning and eat something
 par gandhari nahin maani
 After all Krishna understood and went away
 yuddh ke maidan main akeli gandhari rah gai
 Gandhari was hungry in the middle of the night
 rote-rote uskaa dhyaan saamne jhaad par lage ek ber par gaya
 He thought, "I have just had a night to cry
 ek ber hi kha lun to thodi jaan aae
 "thinking that he raised his hand to hold the plum, then the plum became high
 jab kisi bhi tarah se ber pakadai main nahin aayaa to gandhari ne sochaa, "ek bete ke shav par chadhakar pakaduun to shaayad ber haath main aa jayega
 "she felt ashamed too, but by now the appetite was very strong
 phir usne sochaa, "raat kaa samay he
 Who will see me? ”she dragged the son's body and brought it under the plum
 us par khadey hokar ber ko pakadana chaha, par ber tab tak or upar uth chukaa tha
 One by one, Gandhari placed the bodies of his hundred sons on top of each other and tried to catch the plum
 ber to pakad main nahin aayaa, par saamne se krishna aate najar aa gaye
 When he came near, he said, "gandhari, what is this?" Gandhari said in embarrassment, "krishna, you were right
 jab tak jeena he, is bhukh se to jeet paanaa mushkil he
 There should be some disease, grief, it is in its place, but hunger is the religion of this body
 vah rog-shok kuch nahin dekhati!"*yah kahani maine bahut khoji, par mahabharat ke kisi nae-puraane sanskaran main nahin he
 Not even in any Puranas etc
 
 
 
 But this story was in the Lok Veda of the mother, and the stories of the Lok Veda are such that after reading, you are shaken to the inside! That is what i remembered, Lokmata i
e
 Satyarthi ji's wife used to say in her unique style, "maut Bhukkha Buri, Rati Khadi" Stood again in the morning
 
 
 !" (bhukh to mrityu se bhi buree he
 The night ate her, in the morning she stood again and stood up!) Women probably know this everyday reality of life much more deeply
 isiilie satyaarthee ji jab jhunjhalaakar unhen tokate the ki tum kya har vakt roti or paise kii charchaa lekar baith jaati ho to ve kahati thim, "ek din bhi bagaiyr khaae guzaara chalata he kya? or agar jeb main bas ke liye kiraye ke liye rupaya na ho, to kya koi bas kaa conductor aapako bas main bhi baithne degaa? phir kahan se hogi aapaki ghumkkadi, yaar-doston se milanaa, sahitya ke kisse-kahaniyaan or gapshap
 
 
 ? "mother was not very much beset with money - and she was not greedy in terms of money, but she knew that life could not go far beyond money and bread
 ve dharmik swabhaav kii thim
 Their religiousness saved them from the greed for money, but there was no devotion to money either
 kah sakate hai ki paisa daan dekar apane dhan ko ‘sakaarath’ kar lene vaala sahaj ‘dharmikapana’ unamem tha
 That is, earn money properly and after earning it, give a part of it to those who are true religious gurus, sages and ascetics or needy people
 yah tha paise ko lekar maan ke hisse kaa sach, jise lekar unke man main koi duvidha ant tak nahin thi
 There was no need for money to be woeful or mad for him
 balki aisa lobh yaa utavlaapan yahan buree cheez thi
 It is recalled that Jagan Bhai Sahab, who is an engineer and was the deputy general manager at Hind Lamps Bulb Factory in Shikohabad, was appointed to a high position in a large company in Ernakulam early on
 sab kuch tay tha
 The bus was to be packed and departed after the proposal was approved
 unhone shaayad railway rigerveshan bhi kara liya tha
 But mother was restless
 unhone jagan bhaisahab se poocha, "yahan tumhen kis tarah kii pareshaani he, jiske liye ghar se itani dur janaa tumhen jaruri lag rahaa he?"bhaisahab ke paas is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin tha
 And there will be more salary or a lot of money, it was so useless near the mother that it could not be explained to them
 yahan unka ek hi siddhant tha ki kamao, lekin santosh bhi rakhana siikho
 If a lot of money comes, what will happen? In today's time, mother's talk may not have been as relevant, or it should not be understood
 unke pote-potiyaan or naati-dhevate aaj dur deshon main hai
 But mother always wanted to stay close, share happiness and sorrow with each other and leave unnecessary cravings
 santosh bharaa jivan jeeyo
 i cannot say how much the mother's words are true in today's changed world, not so much
 par main itnaa jarur kahoonga ki maan ekadam galat bhi nahin thim
 Today, the entire life of many people is spent in a blind run and hi-hi
 usase sachmuch hasil kya hota he? ghar viraan ho rahe hai or vahaan kii chahakan khatm ho rahi he
 Empty houses and two disabled people living in them
 puure ghar main bajataa sannata, isliye ki jinamein jindagi or jindadilii he, ve to pardes kooch kar gaye
 Many thanks to mobile, internet and web camera, which has saved the feeling of home but a little bit
 haalaanki kabhi-kabhi main sochataa hoon, aadmi ko jindagi jeene ke liye aakhir kitna chahie? or phir jo kuch hasil karne ke liye ham baahar jate hai, uske badale khote kitna hai- iskaa bhi kya koi hisaab lagaaya ja saktaa he?mujhe yaad padataa he, ek baar purv or pashchim ke jeene or soch-vichaar ke dhang kii bhinnataaon kii charchaa karte hue, swami vivekanand ek bade fark kii ore bhagini nivedita kaa dhyaan khinchaa tha
 He had said, "the whole ideal of Sanatanis is dedication, your (western) ideal is struggle
 faltah ham log jivan kaa anand le sakate hai, tum log kadaapi nahin
 You are always conscious to change your condition for the better, and only a millionth part of it dies before it is completed
 
 
 
 "today, while the western way of living has become a testament to us, remembering my mother and her time, i feel like searching for the roots of Hindustaniyat somewhere
 or yah samaj main aata he ki kitna kuch hamane kho diya he, or jo kuch khoyaa, vah kitna moolyawaan tha
 * Yes, i remembered that mother whose finger i saw the world, she was illiterate, but she used to read the Gita
 gurumukhi lipi main likhi hui gita, jisaki bhashaa punjabi nahin, hindi thi
 Perhaps Nana ji tried to teach him to read the Gita
 mote-mote aksharon main likhi hui gita maan ungali rakh-rakhkar padhati thim thode unche sur main, "tab krishna ne kaha, he arjuna, meri baat dhyaan lagaakar sun
 "in much the same way as the children of the raw or first group read their text by dragging the vowel
 par isse unke bolne main ek ajab lay or aakarshan paidaa ho jaataa tha
 As a child, i often saw my mother reciting the Gita in the morning
 baad main yaa to vah gita kii prati jeern ho gai yaa koi or vajah rahi hogi, jisase maan kaa gita-paath kam ho gaya
 But his religious sentiment did not diminish at all
 or ve vrath par vrath itane rakhti thim ki kisi-kisi hafte to maine unhen saat main se chaar-chaar, paanch-paanch din vrath rakhte dekha! kuch to niyamit rakhe jane vaale vrath the or kuch bich-bich main aane vaale vishesh vrath
 He probably received the same rite that the woman should strangulate herself for the well-being of the family
 vrath keval vrath nahin tha, unki tapasya thi
 And not only the mother, most women of that generation probably had this same life faith
 unhen lagata tha, apane parivaar ke hit ke liye ve shaayad isi tarah khud ko home kar sakati hai
 And this was also the means to keep God happy in his hand, so that there would be satisfaction and peace in the world
 *yaheen bachapan ke un tithi-tyoharon kii baat kii ja sakati he jinamein maan ko nit nae roopon main dekhne kaa avasar miltaa tha
 Among them was the festival of 'navan', in which new bread or perhaps paratha was made
 usamen ghi daalkar churi bana lee jaati
 Now mother used to sit around all the sons
 haath main churi kaa ek grass liye, ek-ek kar ham sab bhaaiyon se puuchhati thi, "chander, main navaan ann chakhaan?
 
 
 Shyam, i want to eat ninth food? 
 
 jagan, main navaan ann chakhaan?
 
 
 Satpal, should i taste ninth food? "we used to say 'yes', but sometimes we used to say 'no' to tease the mother
" to phir maan ko phir se yahi sab silsilaa shuru karnaa padataa ore yon maan us churi kaa ek-ek grass khaatin or maan ke khaane ke baad phir hamen bhi vahi sab miltaa
 But the specialty of this festival was that the mother used to become a baby girl with us and no matter how tight we were, there was no wrinkle on her face
 ham hanste the or maan bhi hamaare saath bilkul bacchee banakar hansati rahati thim
 Like it is a game like kho-kho
 is utsav ke peeche kii bhaavana kya rahi hogi? lagata he, yah krishi vyavastha kaa parv he
 a new grain has arrived in the house
 use acchhee tarah dhokar, sukhaakar khaane ke liye taiyaar kar liya gaya he
 Her loaves are made in the front
 par nayaa ann he, to pataa nahin ki vah kaisaa ho? usamen tanik vishaiylaapan yaa koi or nuksaandaayak vastu bhi ho sakati he, jiskaa hamaare swasthya par bura asar padataa ho
 Therefore, if the new food comes into the house and cooks its bread, then the children should not eat first
 ghar ke bado ko pehle use chakhkar dekhnaa chahie ki yah niraapad he ki nahin
 And if there is no harm on his food, then the other people of the house should also eat
 maan badi thim, ghar or rasoi kii rani thim, isliye navann kii shuruyaat ve khud se karti thim
 And before eating, she used to alert all of us, "chander, i will taste the ninth food?"
 
 
 shyaam, main navaan ann chakhaan?
 
 
 Jagan, i will taste the ninth food? 
 
 satpal, main navaan ann chakhaan?" taaki agar unhen koi nuksaan bhi hota he to ghar ke sadsy isse waakif rahen or samay par upachaar karke unhen bachaaya ja sake
 But i think this today
 us samay to navann ham sab bhaaiyon ke liye ek mjedaar khel hi tha, or maan hamaare saath yah khel khelti hui sachmuch badi mohak lagati thim
 Similarly, during the Navratras, the enthusiasm of the mother was seen
 maan ‘khetari’ (ghar ke aale main jau bona, pratikatmak kheti) bade shauk se bijati thim
 Shyam Bhaiya used to bring soil from the fields especially for him
 maan ne khetari bone ke liye ek alag aalaa banavaa rakhaa tha
 Barley was sown and the mother whose small farm this year was very loud, what was the pleasure and joy of mother! There was a story in the morning, aarti
 usamen maan devi maan kii bahut si aaratiyaan or bhajan gaatin
 But i loved one of them in which i would have liked to repeat along with mother, "nina maiya, tera kangra ghar heal
 
 
 !"is aarti main aage ek pankti aati thi jo mujhe badi pasand thi, "nangi-nangi pairin raja akbar ve aayaa, sone da chatar chadhnda
 
 
 ! "(barefoot King Akbar also came here and offered a parasol of gold)
 ari maan, tera kongda vaala ghar bada acha he!) is aarti kii har pankti ke tukant ko main itnaa ras lekar or itane maje main, balki kahana chahie, thode shararti andaaj main doharaata ki gaate-gaate maan kii hansee chhot jaati or sang-sang main bhi joro se hans padataa
 That is, there would have been a little bluster in devotion and its severity would have reduced slightly
 par meri udaar vichaaron kii maan ko isamen koi aapatti na thi
 Similarly Hoi or Ahoi was also the mother's favorite festival
 meraa khyal he, uttar pradesh main ise ahoi mata kaa tyohaar kehete hai or punjab main hoi kaa
 And it is a festival of well-being of children! However, molasses and molasses were made on that day also
 ham bachche kunda khadkaate hue jor-jor se chillaate, "hoi
 
 
 Hoi 
 
 hoi, lai aapana duddh-puttar, de meri doi
 
 
 ! "then on the call of Mother, we would run and go there after eating some dumplings dipped in molasses molasses, then started shouting again," Hoi
 
 
 hoi
 
 
 Hoi, le apna dud-son, de meri doi
 
 
 !"duddh-puttar kya he, yah bhala koun jaanata tha? haan, gud main dubi aate kii doiyaan ghar bhar main- or saath hi hamaare dilon main bhi anand or ullas bhar deteen
 We children involved in sports could not feel these things much at that time
 par bacchon ke is khel ke saath hi ghar bhar main kaisaa anand lahalha uthta he, ise ve striyaan khub acchhee tarah samajhati thim or unke khushi se damakate chehron par mahasoos kiya ja saktaa tha
 And Karwa Chauth had a different view
 subah-subah bade andhere hi khaasi chahal-pahal se ham bacchon kii neend khulti
 After getting up, in the room, sisters-in-law with plates decorated with good dishes
 khub hansati, baaten karti or saath-saath thodaa-bahut khaati hui
 Mother, among them, looked as if full of pride from a high priest
 main achaanak vahaan pahunchakar majaak karte hue kahata, "acha, to chori-chori khaaya ja rahaa he!" is par bhabhiyon sahit maan khub joro se hansatin
 And she would say, "come on, eat it too
" 
 
 !"shaam ko karwachouth vrath kii katha hoti to aas-pados kii striyaan saj-dhajkar hamaare ghar aatin or maan kii katha shuru hoti
 i do not remember anything else about that story
 bas, ek line jarur yaad he, jo mujhe tab apni vicitra dhvanyaatmakataa ke kaaran bahut aakarshith karti thi ki "jehdi raani hai, oh goli ho gai te jehdi goli hai, oh raani ho gai
 
 
 ! "(ie, the queen who was a maid, she became a maid and she was a maid, she became a queen!) What is the magic of phonology in these words that even today, as if repeating them, as if the whole story of mother and women sitting in the circle ' -sansar 'opens in front of me from inside and outside
 kuch or bhi chote-mote vrath-tyohaar the
 There was also a typical indigenous variety of stale food which was called 'bewade' or something similar
 meraa khyal he, usee ko kahin-kahin ‘basade’ bhi kehete hai or yah holi ke kuch hi roj baad aata he
 And if i am not mistaken, this is sometimes celebrated as a fast or festival of Sheetla Mata
 jis din tyohaar hota, usase ek raat pehle aalu ke dher saare paraanthe banaakar rakh liye jate or agle din ham vahi khate
 It was forbidden to light a stove and eat hot food that day
 kyon bhala? yani iske peeche asli baat yaa vishwaas kya tha? ise main aaj tak nahin jaan paaya
 However a friend explained with great confidence in the past, that "brother, there is a symbol in the Bewade festival that you eat stale food today, but it is the last day to eat stale food
 iske baad basi khaanaa band
 Due to the change of seasons, one should eat freshly made food
 "yah vyakhya sahi he yaa galat, nahin kah saktaa
 But this much is certain that many old things have symbolic meaning
 unase nae or puraane vakton kii tulana karne kaa anand bhi hamaare haath aa jaataa he
 There was talk of festivals
 usee silsile main yaad aayaa, shuru main shivaratri bhi hamaare parivaar main khub jor-shor se manaai jaati thi
 In the evening, the fire of the dormitories in the courtyard was kindled
 uske chaaron ore pani chhidakte hue ham log parikrama karte
 Mother used to bake thick 'rot' on that flame
 namakeen bhi, mithe bhi
 And they were eaten with sweet and salty lassi for several days
 mujhe yaad he, mithi lassi ke saath namakeen rot or namakeen lassi ke saath mithe rot khaanaa mujhe bahut acha lagata tha
 It is also not irrelevant to record here that Maa was a devotee of Shiva and she had named my name Shivchandra Prakash
 haalaanki itnaa lanbaa naam chalaa nahin or skool main daakhile ke samay had master sahab ne khud-ba-khud chota karke use chandraprakash bana diya
 But it fills the mind that this name has mother's touch and the moon in my name is actually a moon in the head of Shiva
 tyohaar ke din maan kii banaai chizon or khaane main pataa nahin kaise, anokhaa ras aa jaataa
 Thus mother was not an extraordinary cook, but she had a lot of juice in her things
 maan ke banaae khaane kii baat karen to maan aalu or muuli ke paraanthe khub achche banaati thim
 Probably someone could make bread soaked with plenty of ghee from maize and millet
 use ham log roti nahin, ‘dhodhaa’ kaha karte the
 That means maize dhodna, millet dhodha
 
 
 vagairah-vagairah
 During winter, such things were no less than precious to us, and leave the five-star hotel ahead of them, we could also leave the dish of heaven
 or sardiyon main maan ke haath kii banaai gud or aate kii pinniyon ke liye to aaj bhi tarasata hoon
 They seemed to me more tasty than the best sweets in the world
 *maan ne yaad nahin padataa ki kabhi peeta ho
 Rather far from being beaten, i do not remember that mother ever scolded me lightly
 maan ko na jane kaisaa yah ajab-sa vishwaas tha apni santanon ko lekar ki mere bete yaa betiyaan galat nahin ho sakate! yaa ve kabhi kuch galat kar hi nahin sakate
 
 
 
 ek choti si ghatana yaad aa rahi he- or vah holi ke maukey kii he
 It happened that Holi had hardly one or two days left
 ham sab bachche apni-apni pichakaariyaan liye morachon par date the
 There is an open field in front of our house, with four lanes coming out of its four ends
 yani koi kahin se bhi inamen se nikalakar aa saktaa tha yaa ja saktaa tha
 And our watchful eyes were at these four ends
 itane main ek sajjan drylin kiye hue badhiya kot-pant, taai pahane hue nikle
 True statues of arrogance and pride! Now who should paint on them? All the children were afraid, so i pledged
 main us chote se baldal kaa nayak jo tehra! main chupake-chupake unke peeche gaya or phir ekaek apni pichakaari se unhen chheentmaeent kar diya
 When i found out, he, the coat-panther, ran after me in a fury of angry monsieur
 main tab chota sa tha
 Lean and slim lihaaja ekaek uchhalkar ghar ke andar! ab main surakshit ghere main tha
 Those gentlemen also wanted to come home fast enough to fall on our platform
 
 
 
 a very wet color was scattered on the platform
 lihaaja jitna hamane lagaaya, usase zyada rang khud-ba-khud lag gaya
 Now his anger is even more elevated
 andar aakar unhone shikaayat kii
 Mother said, "I will scold them, but these are small children
 betaa, tu bataa, tuune koun-si samajhadaari kii ki holi se ek din pehle yah suut pahanakar chalaa aayaa?
 
 
 You have gone with them too! ”hearing this, their mercury landed, ashamed
 baad main maan ne hamen samajhaayaa ki aisa nahin karte
 But in front of others, she used to save her children like a lioness! And slowly she would continue to learn that, look, i don't have to look down because of you! However, this belief of mother - knowingly and unknowingly - gave us a lot of strength, a lot of strength and still gives us this day
 lagata tha ki maan kaa chaahe ham par yah bholaa vishwaas hi he, par hamen is vishwaas ko jhootha nahin hone dena, khud ko bhatakane nahin dena

 GST lagu hone ke baad desh ke kai rajyon main chal rahi lottery system par bada asar padane ja rahaa he
 The GST Council has fixed a tax slab of 12 per cent for the government to run its lottery
 vahiin privet lottery par 28 fisadi slab rakhaa he
 With this decision, it is clear that if a state has to increase its revenue, then it should allow private companies to run lotteries so that they can increase their revenue by collecting more and more tax
 maujuuda samay main desh main lottery or gambling par kuch pratibandh hai
 For this, the Central Government's Lottery Regulation Act 1998 exists, on the basis of which all the states and centrally governed states of the country can make their own laws for lottery
 is act ke aadhaar par desh main kai rajya samay-samay par lottery yojit karte hai vahiin kuch rajya online lottery khilne kii manjuuri bhi dete hai
 Significantly, the government of Goa, Punjab, Sikkim and Maharashtra conduct lottery games in the country
 is khel main ukt rajya main rahane vaale 18 varsh se adhik umr ke log hissaa le sakate hai
 Where many states do not yet tax the business in this lottery game and their income is earned through the income tax being collected from the reward recipients
 kendra sarkaar kaa anumaan he ki desh main lottery kaa kul kaarobaar lagbhag 50,000 karod rupee he
 The state governments try to increase their revenue through this game
 jahaan pehle nijee athwa sarkari lottery par koi sarvice tex nahin lagata tha ab jiesti ke tahat isse rajya sarkaron ko bada munafa hoga
 In any state, 28 percent tax will be collected from the lottery operator, while the reward will be earned separately from the income tax
 haalanki, kendra sarkaar ke is faisle se lottery kaarobaari ko zyada jhatka laga he
 Lottery traders believe that flat tax in GST will hurt their business and only increase the government's earnings
 desh ke sabase bade online lottery company playwin kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar ko lottery ke khel memphesvalu par tex lene ke bajaae company ke profit marginpar tex lagaana chahie
 According to the industry, there are three aspects in the game of lottery, first, government tax, second prize money and third company profit
 lihaaja, ise sarvice maanate hue jiesti main tex lagane se sirf sarkaar kii kamai badhegi or kaarobaariyon ko kam profit main santosh karnaa padegaa
 Asaram may be in jail, surrounded by the accusations of sexual abuse, beating his hands to come out, but Asaram and his devotees believe that he does not believe and this time a disciple of Asaram has threatened that if If the girl complaining against Asaram did not withdraw her report, the result is the same, death
 yani baba ab sam, daam, dand, bhed har hatkande par utaaru hai
 On the telephone, a man is threatening to withdraw the complaint of sexual abuse filed against the so-called Saint Asaram and not only threatening, but also saying that if the girl's family did not do so, Then his entire family will be destroyed
 telephone risive karanevaala shaks to peedit ladki ke pita kaa dost he, jabaki telephone karanevaala shaks asaram kaa wo sevadaar, jisaki pahunch asaram ke ashramon se lekar uske tamaam gupt thikaanon tak he or is vakt shyaam naam kaa yahi sevadaar ladki or uske gharavaalon ke liye jo kuch kah rahaa he, wo naa sirf chaunkaanewaala balki behad sangeen he
 Shyam is asking the girl's father's friend to withdraw the lawsuit lodged against Asaram by the girl's family members
 uskaa kahana he ki agar unhone aisa nahin kiya, to aanevaala vakt unke liye bahut bura hoga kyonki aaj nahin to kal ye asaram par ai ye sari museebataan khatm ho jaaengi, lekin iske baad asaram ke lakhon-karodon bhakt unhen nahin chodenge, balki jaan se maar daalenge
 By the way, instead of calling the girl's father directly, Shyam has his plea behind calling a friend
 uskaa kahana he ki chunki ladki kaa pita in dinon uskaa phone nahin uthaa rahaa he, aise main us tak ye baaten pahunchane kaa sirf vahi ek jariya he
 The offer of bribe to the policemen, then the threat of death and now these words of a family of Asaram, who were said to the family of the victim girl, have created new trouble for Asaram behind bars
 ise andhbhakti nahin to or kya kahenge ki jo asaram yon shoshan ke iljaam main giraftaar hokar jail bhi chale gaye, usee asaram ke chelon ke liye unki giraftaar ab bhi naammumkin he
 In this telephonic conversation, Asaram's special voice can be heard not only threatening the friend of the girl's father but also saying that this fight of justice proved to be air
 ek jagah ye shaks kahata he ki media se lekar duniya ke tamaam log sab peeche rah jaaenge, nuksaan hoga to sirf ladki or uske gharavaalon ko
 However, when the girl's father's friend quips on these things of Asaram's protégé, the protagonist is also shaken for a while, but after a while again tries to threaten him by saying that Asaram is supported by thousands of saints Is, with a gesture of Asaram who can create uproar across the country
 baharhaal, telephone par mili is taji dhamkee ke baad ab asaram ke liye nai musiibat khadi ho gai he
 Apparently, when Asaram himself is in jail, this is the big question, after all, on whose orders his disciples are threatening the families of the victim girl in this way
 hindustan ke sabase azim or sabase shoharatmand vakil ram jethmalani jab apane muvakkil asaram ke liye pairvi karne jodhpur pahunche, to sari nigahen jaise unheen par hi tik gayi
 Along with Asaram, the common people were also desperate to know what magic wand Jethmalani brings, which brings relief for Asaram but says that the law does its job
 lijaja jethmalani kii bahes or daleelon ke baavjood asaram ke jail se baahar nikalne kaa rasta philhal saafe naa hua
 At least Monday did not bring any relief for Asaram
 ek taraf jahaan hai court ne unki jamaanat par bahes ke liye agali taarikh 18 sitambar kii mukarrar kar di, vahiin duusari taraf nichali adaalat ne asaram ko phir se 14 dinon ke liye salaakhon ke peeche bhejne kaa hukum suna diya
 It is another matter that Jethmalani left no stone unturned to argue in the High Court in favor of Asaram
 unhone asaram ke bete narayan sai kii theory ko sahi tehraate hue asaram ke upar iljaam lagane vaali ko hi maansik rup se biimaar qaraar diya
 He said that the girl made imaginary charges on Asaram in the condition of illness
 jethmalani ne khud asaram ke ashram ke un dastavezon ke sahi maanane se inkaar kar diya, jiske mutabik ladki naaballig qaraar di gai thi
 He said that instead of relying on the Ashram documents, a medical examination should be done to ascertain the correct age of the girl
 jethmalani ne is baat par bhi sawaal khadey kiye ki akhir jab ladki ke saath uski maa ke rahete hue band kamare main zyaadati hui, to donon ne ye baat tab ashram main kisi se kyon nahin kahi
 He also termed the girl's recording of statement under 164 immediately after the FIR but the prosecution questioned whether it was a conspiracy or whether the girl was ill, Jethmalani should decide first
 haalanki is garmagaram bahes ke baad adaalat ne jamaanat par agali sunwaayee ke liye buudhvaar kaa din tay kar diya
 The lambs of the lord's son are now in their true colors
 us bacchee ne jisane asaram kii gandi nazaron ke saamne bhasma ho jane kii bajaae uske aadhyatm kii akashganga ko nanga karne kii himmat dikhaai
 It is alleged that when Asaram's goons lost the law, they came down on the thrust of Kantha
 jivan kaa aashirwad bechney vaale baba ke shishy zindagi chin lene ke liye chatapata rahe hai lekin ye to kuch bhi nahin
 In the threats being given to the family, it is being said that Asaram's disciples have become terrorists to save their guru, who is immersed in the smell
 asaram bhale andar he lekin baahar uski lila jari he
 It is being said that this is the voice of Shyam, the servant of Asaram
 ab asaram ke ashramon main sannata pasra hua he lekin uske perol par palane vaale sevadaaron kii swamibhakti abhi bhi bol rahi he
 Asaram's dance-song, spectacle, bouncing and dhol-tasha are all locked in the lockup of Jodhpur jail but this is the specialty of devotion
 liladhari band ho jaae to ho jaae lanpaton kii lila band nahin hoti

 For almost half a century, he has been spreading the message of humanity to the people through the transformation of Ram's character in the country and all the world
 yah ek aisa anokhaa sant he jisaki ramakatha main harijan or musalmaan bhi mehmaan hote hai
 In Bapu's story, there is of course mention of Rama but all religions, deities of religions, prophets are also there
 kuch saal pehle duniya bhar ke majahabon par roshni daalane vaali ek conference baapu ne karwaai thi
 The purpose of which was to mention what was told about Qaumi Yakjahti in all religions

 Such is the personality of Morari Bapu
 unase miliye to lagata he ki saadagi kii paraakaashtha shaleenta kii intihaan se mil rahe hon
 In today's brutal, eventful environment, when fingers are rising on the big posts of every field, the downtrodden themselves are on the verge of collapsing, the urns of faith are wavering, personal disharmony is bent on shaking the collective foundations
 Where does social trust breathe? The big question is
 aise main ek muskaata, aas bandhaata cheharaa ubharta he, maano kah rahaa ho doobane waalo na ghabaraao ke ham aate hai
 This is the face of Morari Bapu, on whose orders, he has also got the privilege of being present in service, reciting poetry and being rude
 sahajata, saralata or vyaavhaarik shystagi unke vyaktitv ke ve aakarshan hai jo bagaiyr bole sambodhit karte hai
 The ignorant mind of discrimination and the enormous generosity of this mind is such a great propagator of human friendship, it can only be gauged that the supporters of their self-realization are found in every section
 ve ramakatha manch ko maanavtaa manch ke rup main prastut karne or aaj ke sandarbhon se jodakar jivan darshan banane vaale shaayad ekmaatr kathavachak hai, jo bikhron ko sametane or bigadon ko sanbhaalane main lage hai
 Discourse can make someone popular, it can be a favorite
 jisaki sadhana samarpan aadhaarit ho, jo karm vachan vaani kaa sachcha sadhak ho
 Perhaps the big secret of Morari Bapu being Manmohan is that what he says, thinks, he lives
 unki kathani-kerani main virodhabhas nahin
 Bapu is the spokesperson for the linguistic colors of the soul, hence a connoisseur of good poetry and a lover
 ve apane pravachanon main prasiddh shaayaron ke sher munasib sandarbhon main kuch is prakaar se prayog karte hai ki arthon kii nai tahen khulne lagati hai
 Recognizing shayari, honoring shayar and inviting it among your millions of listeners, shows their great thinking and big vision
