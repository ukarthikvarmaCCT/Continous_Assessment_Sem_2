 Before the opposition becomes active on any other issue, the VHP announced that its homecoming and other campaigns will be intensified

 It was the Sangh and its organization that helped the Modi government come to power with full force
 yahi wo sanghathan the jinhone janata ke bich jaakar modi ke agenda ko saakaar kiya
 These saffron organizations were accused by opposition parties of dividing votes in the name of religion
 jiskaa sidhaa phayda chunaav main bijepi ko hua
 Such statements are coming from these organizations which indicate that there are differences between the government and the union organizations but no such concrete reason is understood

 anshadaataaon kaa bhi kahana he ki unhen is utpaada par karadhaan ke bare main nahin pataa kyonki bank karadhaan se jude vivaran uplabdh karaane main asamarth hai

 tamilnadu ke thirunelaveli jile ke minakshipuram gaanv ke lagbhag 150 dalit pariwaron ne is kshetra ke dabadabe vaale thevar samudaay ke taanon or vyangy se tang aakar islam kabool kar liya
 After this incident, right-wing Hindu groups launched a nationwide campaign against conversion and liberal leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee went to Tamil Nadu and requested these families to re-adopt Hinduism
 ri-canvarjan yanipunerdharmantaran / paravartanke prayaas adhik nahin to kam se kam itane puraane to hai hi
 Inequality is the reason for conversion
 Social scientists say that the main reason for leaving your religion and adopting another religion is the inequality prevailing in the society
 haashie par pahunchaa die gaye log dabadabe yaa oonchi haisiyat vaali jati or samudaay se apamaanit or upekshit mahasoos karne par yah kadam uthaate hai
 According to RSS chief spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya, the lack of contacts and dialogue between upper caste Hindus and weaker sections of the society leads to leaders of other religions exploiting their feelings and inciting them to convert
 baari sankhya main aise dharmantaran ko rokane ke liye dakshinpanthi sanghathan punardharmantaran karavaate hai
 Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh have laws to prevent forcible or fraudulent conversion
 dharmantaran roak ke liye kanoonsansadeey maamalon ke mantri em
 Venkaiah Naidu is now trying to enact an anti-national conversion law
 lekin vipaksh ke netaa ab ise apane hindutv brands ko puure desh par thopane kaa hatkandaa bataa rahe hai
 Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia says, 'every citizen of the country is free to adopt the religion of his choice
 yah uskaa nijee maamla hota he
 The real matter is of forced conversions which the BJP is trying to divert
 ' samaaj vigyaani dipankar gupta kaa bhi maananaa he ki dharmantaran par puri tarah pratibandh lagaana samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 They say, 'we should ban forced conversions
 yah parivartan satahi yaa dikhaawati bhi hota he kyonki log praaia: apane mul dharm main laut aate hai
 The allegation of counter-accusations, however, is that Hindu organizations allege that Christian missionaries are forcibly converting lower-class Hindus in poor areas by offering free education and health facilities
 duusari ore isai samoohon kaa daawa he ki haashie par pahunch hindu khud hi apana dharm badal rahe hai
 According to him, through their efforts to re-convert Hindu groups are giving these people facilities and other types of inducements from the government, in this way it was also forcible conversion
 haalanki yah daavon or pratidaavon kaa kissa he, lekin hindu sanghathanon ko tab aankadon kaa thos aadhaar mil gaya jab 25 june 2013 ko kerala ke mukhyamantri oman chandi ne rajya vidhayika ko suchit kiya ki 2006 se 2012 ke bich 7,713 logon ne islam apana liya jabaki is avadhi main hindu dharm main lautne waalon kii sankhya sirf 2,803 thi
 The number of people who converted to Christianity during this period was not available with them
 jabaran dharm parivartan par pratibandh lagane ke kanoon kaa itihaas british kaal main dhundha ja saktaa he
 Many princely states had then enacted anti-conversion laws
 bhagava brigade ko badhatabhagava brigade ne ghar vaapasi kaa naaraa gadhakar badhat to hasil kar hi lee he kyonki pun: dharmantaran kisi bhi dharmantaran virdohi kanoon ke daayre main nahin aata he
 Re-conversion means correcting a mistake made earlier
 ise ek tarah kii vaidhata bhi praapt he
 Arpita Anand, Associate Fellow at the Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis says, "the law prohibits conversion to religion, but does not prohibit lower-caste Hindus from returning to their religion
" ' dipankar gupta 'ghar vaapasi’ kii avadharana ko bhi khaarij kar dete hai
 He argues that Islam is like a home for fifth generation Muslims
 yah to aisa hi he jaise koi shwet america ashwet america se africa lautne ko kahe, jabaki ashwet america kai peedhishon se america main rah rahe hai or ab yah unke ghar jaisaa he
 The question is whether re-converting fourth or fifth generation Muslims or Christians in the name of homecoming is not just an attempt to increase the numbers? This will be known only after the assembly elections in the Hindi-speaking states - Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 purv bhartiya captain kapil dev ne kaha ki unhen abhi tak pakistan ke bhavi pradhanmantri imran khan se shapath grahan samaaroh main shirkat karne kaa nimantran patr nahin mila he, haalanki unhone anaupchaarik rup se is kaarykram main upasthit hone kii sahmati de di he
 Kapil said, 'I have been invited, but not in writing
 mujhe unki team kaa phone aayaa tha, lekin mujhe abhi tak koi mail nahin mila he
 i await the official invitation
 ’kapil ne kaha, ‘agar mujhe aadhikarik nimantran miltaa he to main jaaoongaa or is samaaroh main shirkat karuunga
 Kapil congratulated on the phone for becoming Prime Minister of Imran
 kapil ne kaha, ‘maine kaha ki ‘shaabaash yuva’
 He said that it was nice to see a cricketer like Imran reaching the post of Prime Minister of Pakistan
 IND vs ENG: birmingham main bharat kii jeet kaa sapana tutaa, england ne 31 ranon se di matakapil ne imran ke saath kai match khele hai
 He said, 'imran has worked very hard for 20 years and he continued to work selflessly for his country and today he also got the result
 mujhe ummid he ki vah isi tareeke se kaam karte rahenge
 Imran's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) led the party in the elections held on 25 July
 kapil ne yah bhi ummid jataai ki bharat or pakistan bade muddon ko sulajhane or kshetra main shanti laane main safal rahenge
 He hoped that Imran would also do well as the Prime Minister of Pakistan as he was a very good captain for his country's cricket team
 kapil ne kaha, ‘imran bahut hi achche captain the, pakistan jaisi team kii aguwai karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 It was due to his excellent captaincy that Pakistan was able to do well
 mujhe ummid he ki vah pradhanmantri ke taur par bhi apane desh ke liye aisa hi karenge

 But does PM Modi watch movies or listen to songs in his busy schedule? Many such questions come to mind
 beete dinon akshay kumaar ko die ek intervyuu main piem modi ne in sawaalon kaa jawaab diya tha
 Keeping aside the talk of politics, Akshay Kumar had asked PM Modi- Do you watch movies? Which was the last movie you saw? Modi said, "I don't get much opportunity to watch movies
 ek baar jab main gujarat kaa mukhyamantri tha tab amitabh bachchan aae the
 He requested me to watch his film "paa"
 anupam kher ne aatankwaad par ek film banaai thi, e vadensade
 i went to see that film with him, but i can't find time now
 "piem modi ko pasand he lata mangeshkar kaa ye gandhakshay kumaar ne piem se yah bhi poocha ki kya aap hindi music gunagunaanaa pasand karte hai ? modi ne apane do pasandida gaanon kaa zikr kiya
 Modi said, "I don't sing too many songs, but the song that is my favorite is Jyoti Kalash Chalke
 bataate chalem ki jyoti kalash chhalke
 
 
 The 1961 film is a song by Bhabhi Ji Ki Chudiyan which was sung by Sudhir Phadke and Lata Mangeshkar
 narendra modi ne kaha, "iske alaava mujhe o pawan veg se udne vaale ghode
 
 
 The song is also very much liked

 kai khaas maukon par unhen bollywood sitaron se milte hue dekha gaya he
 Ever since Yogi Adityanath took power in Uttar Pradesh, the miscreants have started getting eliminated from here
 upi police pichley do saal se kai muthbhed main badmaashon kaa safaya kar chuki he
 Now Yogi Adityanath has once again made an absurd statement
 mumbai main ek kaarykram main shaamil hue yogi ne kaha ki acha hua maharashtra aties ne aatankiyon ko pakad liya, agar ve upi main aate to main unhen seemaa par hi nipta detaa
 Actually, Yogi Adityanath attended an event in Mumbai on the occasion of Uttar Pradesh Day
 unke alaava maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis bhi is kaarykram main the
 Yogi Adityanath, who addressed the program here, said, "I would like to thank you that some terrorists were conspiring to disrupt Kumbh, but your ATS stopped them here
" vaise ve agar uttar pradesh main ghuste to main unhen uttar pradesh kii seemaa par hi nipta detaa’’
 This statement of the UP CM is continuously getting viral on social media
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar ko maharashtra ATS ne 9 logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 During the raids in Thane and Aurangabad, it was revealed that these people were thinking of creating panic in the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, but the ATS canceled the plan
 in sandigdhon ke paas se laptop, pandrive, gajet jaisi kai saamagree baraamad hui thi, aties in sabhi se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Badger in awe! The encounter had gained momentum since Yogi Adityanath became Chief Minister in Uttar Pradesh in 2017
 yogi sarkaar ne aankada jari karte hue kaha ki unke abhi tak ke kaarykaal main kareeb 3000 muthbhed hui hai, jinamein 7000 se adhik badmaashon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 While 89 criminals have been killed
 uttar pradesh main lagaataar hote encounter ko lekar vipaksh ne bhi yogi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 The notice of the Human Rights Commission was also sent to the Yogi government
 rajdhani dilli main badmaashon ne saream do logon ko goli markar 40 lakh rupye lut liye
 The incident is in Keshav Puram area of northwest Delhi
 police ke mutabik somvaar dopaher ek medical company ke do karmchaaree jo collection kaa kaam karte hai, hospital se cash lekar duusari jagah ja rahe the
 At the same time, on the flyover near the Wazirpur depot, the I-T car of these employees was overtaken by another car and stopped on the middle road, and at gunpoint started searching for a bag full of money in this car
 jab bag nahin mila to luteron ne donon karmchaariyon ko goli maar di or unki ai ten car lekar faraar ho gaye
 The robbers left the car in front and escaped with a cache full of money from inside it
 badmaashon ne tejpal or rajkumaar naam ke donon karmchaariyon ko ek-ek goli maari he
 Rajkumar is shot in the stomach, which has been operated upon
 tejpal ke kandhe main gardan ke paas goli fansi hui he
 Both have been admitted to Max Hospital
 is fliover ke aasapaas koi CCTV camera bhi nahin laga he, jisaki vajah se police ko badmaashon kaa ab tak koi suraag nahin mil sakaa he
 Keshav Puram police reached the spot and started investigating the case
 lekin jis tarah se is lut ko bich sadak par anjaam diya gaya usase saaf jaahir he ki badmaashon main police kaa jaraa bhi khauf nahin he
 Police say they suspect the miscreants had cash information
 yahi vajah he ki bag naa milane par bhi wo car saath lut ke le gaye, or bag milane ke baad car chhod gaye
 bjp's 31 October 2018 date report uploaded on the Election Commission website on November 20 does not have the seal of the R&I section

 bjp's report was not available till 1 November 2018, nothing has been written before the filing date
 dekhie chunaav ayog kii website bataa rahi ki bijepi kii report tumode(mangalvaar) ko sabamit hui
 This day was 20 November
 chunaav ayog kii website bataa rahi he ki bijepi kii varsh 2017-18 kii countribution report 27july 2018 ko file hui, jabaki kavring pej par 31 oktober kii date darj he
 See the difference in the report of Communist Party and BJP
 bijepi kii varsh 2016-17 kii puranicountribution report dekhie, jisamen maanak puure hai or r & i section or expendichar section donon kii bhi lagi he muhar, magar 2017-18 kii report menaisa nahin hua
 In a meeting held with political parties in Delhi on 27 August 2018, the Election Commission had instructed that without filing returns and submission of contribution report, tax exemption cannot be granted
 phir bhi ayog kii ore se tay samay-seemaa 31 oktober 2018 ke bheetar bijepi sahit 30 anya kshetreey dalon ne countribution report jamaa nahin kii thi
 However, later on November 20, the bjp's report was suddenly uploaded on the Election Commission website
 tippaniyambijapi ko mili chande kaa byora Ajay Dubey, who has exposed several cases through RTI so far, says that the commission should have taken action if it fails to submit the contribution report within the time limit
 is sthiti main iskar vibhaag ko bijepi sahit sabhi 30 dalon ko notice jari kar ection lete hue varsh 2017-18 main jutaaye gaye chande par tex lagaana chahie
 In the year 2016-17, the BJP, in its annual audit report, Rs 7,10,05,78,051
 (710 karod se adhik) chande or aay kii rakam ghoshit kii thi
 On November 20, the bjp's contribution report on the Commission's website mentioned about Rs 400 crore of donations
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vaarshik audit report aane tak yah dhanrashi doguni ho sakati he
 If the tax exemption given to the BJP ends on violation of the rules, then they will have to pay tax of about 30 percent of the total income
 is prakaar sirf bijepi ko hi sau se do sau karod kaa tex jamaa karnaa pad jayega
 Ajay Dubey says that given the stand of the Commission, it seems that it is trying to save a party like BJP instead of taking action

 Details of donations received by BJP artiai ke jariye ab tak kai maamle ujagar kar chuke ajay dube kehete hai ki samay-seemaa ke bheetar countribution report jamaa karne main fail sabit hone par ayog ko karrwai kerani chahie thi
 In this situation, the Income Tax Department should take notice to all 30 parties including BJP and take action and tax the collected funds in the year 2017-18
 varsh 2016-17 main bijepi ne apni vaarshik audit report main 7,10,05,78,051 ru
 (more than 710 crores) was declared amount of donations and income
 20 november ko ayog kii website par uplabdh bijepi kii countribution report main kareeb 400 karod rupee chande kaa zikr he
 It is being told that this amount may double till the annual audit report comes
 agar niyamon ke ulanghan par bijepi ko milane vaala tex chhot khatm hua to unhen kul aay kaa kareeb 30 pratishat tex chukaana padegaa
 In this way, only BJP will have to pay tax of hundred to two hundred crores
 ajay dube kehete hai ki ayog ke rukh ko dekhte hue lag rahaa he ki vah karrwai kii jagah bijepi jaise dal ko bachaane kii koshish main he

 No one got majority in Haryana assembly elections, can form government with BJP in jjpkarnataka, Dushyant Chautala can become CM, Maharashtra and Haryana assembly election results have almost made the picture clear
 maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane ke liye spasht bahumat miltaa dikhaai de rahaa he, jabaki haryana main vah jaadui number se dur rah gai he
 The BJP has called a parliamentary board meeting to brainstorm on the election results
 in sabake bich haryana main agar sabase zyada kisi kii charchaa he to vah dushyant chautaala or unki party jejepi kii he
 Such information is coming out that JJP will support Bharatiya Janata Party to form government in Haryana
 haalanki, isse pehle yah khabar ai thi ki jejepi ne congress ko samarthan dene ke liye mukhyamantri pad kii shart rakhi he
 But the Congress still has an option to form a government in Haryana if it, along with the JJP, follows the Karnataka model
 lekin iske liye use mukhyamantri pad dushyant chautaala ko dena hoga
 What is the Karnataka model? Something similar happened in Karnataka when the Congress, along with the JDS, made HD Kumaraswamy the CM to keep the BJP out of power
 karnataka main bijepi bahumat se chand siten dur thi, lekin congress ne 37 siton vaali jedies ko samarthan karte hue kumaraswami ko siem bana diya gaya tha
 In Haryana, Dushyant Chautala's party has come in the role of JJP King Maker
 yah alag baat he ki JJP ke saath milakar bijepi sarkaar bana sakati he lekin congress ke paas bhi ye vikalp he jisase vah bijepi ko satta se dur rakh sakati he
 The high command gave free hand to Hooda, in view of the trends that have come up till now, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has spoken to Bhupendra Singh Hooda over the phone and has given him the entire free hand in Haryana
 sarkaar banane ke liye hooda koi bhi faisla apane dam par le sakate hai
 Also, if the government is not formed, Hooda has also been asked to consider whether to make Dushyant Chautala the chief minister or not

 He told the Indian Express newspaper, 'lord Brahma was the greatest scientist of this universe
 vah dianasor ke bare main jaanate the or vedon main iskaa acchhee tarah se ullekh bhi kiya he
 There is nothing that Lord Brahma, the creator of this creation, does not know, he was fully aware of the existence of dinosaurs and he has also mentioned it in the Vedas
 duniya main kisi se bhi pehle bhagwaan brahma ne dianasor ke astitv kii khoj kii thi
 India was a very suitable place for the development of dinosaurs
 rajasoras naam ke dianasor kii utpatti bharat main hi hui thi
 Anshu Khosla claimed that he along with his team had discovered the remains of the 'indian' dinosaur in Kheda district of Gujarat and officially named it 'rajasorus Narmada Ensis'
 unhone daawa kiya, 'america or britisharsahamaare vedon se dianasor kaa concept lekar chale gaye or iske bare main unako jaankaree hui

 No one in the world probably knows this, but it is true that all things, even dinosaurs, are mentioned in the Vedas

 Advocate Deepak Anand has filed a petition seeking dismissal of former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor's bail in the Sunanda Pushkar case, which was heard in the Delhi High Court on Tuesday
 is dauraan dilli police ne silband lipaphe main apni states report hoicourt ko di
 The petition filed by advocate Deepak Anand in the High Court said that the anticipatory bail granted by Shashi Tharoor from Patiala House Court should be canceled immediately
 yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki is maamle main bina niyamit jamaanat liye agrim jamaanat de di gai
 However, during the court hearing, the plea of advocate Deepak Anand was questioned on behalf of Delhi Police that they do not have any locus in this case
 maamle main wo na to peedit paksh main se kisi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai or na hi is maamle main unka shashi tharur yaa sunanda pushkar se koi sambandh he
 Lawyers for both Delhi Police and Shashi Tharoor also questioned the petitioner's petition in the High Court in this case
 donon pakshon ke vakeelon kaa kahana tha ki agrim jamaanat nichali adaalat se mili he
 Therefore, it should have been challenged in the sessions court itself and not in the High Court
 philhal court ne is maamle main shashi tharur ko notice jari nahin kiya he
 Now the Delhi High Court will hear the case again on October 9
 maamle main sabhi pakshon ko sunne ke baad hi hoicourt yah faisla karegaa ki is arji par shashi tharur kii jamaanat ko khaarij kiya jaae yaa nahin? sunanda pushkar kii hatya ke maamle main dilli police patiala house court main pehle hi chargeshit daakhil kar chuki he, jisamen mukhya or akele aaropee shashi tharur hi hai
 On behalf of Delhi Police, 56 people have also been made witnesses in this case
 dilli police ne apni chargeshit main shashi tharur par aarope lagaaya he ki unhone sunanda pushkar ko aatmahatya ke liye uksaaya
 The petition filed in the High Court for dismissal of bail also questioned that even after passing for more than 4 years, Delhi Police did not arrest Shashi Tharoor even once

 darasal, isse pehle, sirf vipaksh hi nitish kumaar par aarope madh rahaa tha
 Shivanand Tiwari had said that Nitish Kumar is the real architect of the schism in the RJD
 tiwari ke anusaar, sab kuch nitish kii jaankaree main hua, lekin patrakaron ne jab is bare main sawaal kiya to vah maasoomiyat ke saath taal gaye

 1
 The penalty and interest on the conversion charge / parking charge should be withdrawn in full and the shopkeepers who have previously submitted the conversion charge, should not be recovered again
 2
 Special status of the Walled City should be established immediately and Mughal carpet markets like Kashmiri Gate, Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Chavadi Bazar, Khari Baoli, Naya Bazar, Karol Bagh are completely exempted from conversion charges
 3
 The conversion charge rates should be reduced and the markets from which the MCD has recovered the conversion and parking charges should be spent on the development of that market
 4
 351 roads pending for years should be notified for commercial or mixed land use
 5
 The FAR should be 400 and the parking and fire NOC must be removed
 6
 a committee should be constituted to prepare a proposal on the issue of sealing, consisting of DDA officials, MCD officials, Delhi Government representatives, LG, Urban Development Ministry officials and business representatives
 7
 The DDA has fixed 75% ground coverage of shops larger than 100 square meters of local shopping centers and built on plot size of 250 square meters
 jise 100 % kiya janaa chahie

 You have a glorious day too@smritiirani— Priyanka Chaturvedi (@priyankac19)may 23, 2016 NCP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Chhagan Bhujbalan said in the program of Aaj Tak's Mumbai Manthan that Shiv Sena in Maharashtra writes questions against BJP by writing editorials every day
 jabaki wo sarkaar main bhi he
 In such a situation, it is fraud with the public
 chagan bhujabal ne kaha ki shivasena ko agar sarkaar kii nitiyaan nahin pansad aa rahi he to vipaksh main rahakar sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaae
 But she is not doing so
 vah sarkaar ke saath bhi he or virodh main bhi
 One way is to trap Longo
 unhone kaha ki aapas main matbhed hone chahie
 But the way the Shiv Sena writes against Modi and the Fadnavis government through editorials and the way the BJP faces it
 iske liye bijepi kii tarif kerani chahie
 He said that we are with the people and the people are against the government
 inhone janata se jo vaade kiye the use ab ye jumala bataa rahe hai
 Congress state president Ashok Chavan said on the relationship of Shiv sena-bjp that both have no choice
 isiilie ye donon saath rahete hai or jhagadate bhi he, lekin saath hi rahenge
 He said that we too have stayed in government together with NCPK, but have not done such activities
 jabaki hamaare andar bhi matbhed hote the, par use baithkar hal karte the
 Chavan said that Congress never fooled the public like BJP
 jabaki bijepi netaa ne kaha ki ensipi or congress jab sarkaar main thi to isse bhi zyada donon bhi katutaa rahi he
 He said that when different parties come to power together, there are some differences
 unhone kaha ki shivasena or ham mitra hai, lekin ham chaahate hai ki koi tikaa tippanee nahin honi chahie
 Stay away from such things as much as we can and run the government smoothly
 unhone kaha ki 2019 main ham phir ek saath milakar chunaav ladenge

 samvidhan kaa anuchhed35eoxnuchhed 370jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja pradaan karte hai
 Under which the residents here have special rights
 kashmirako special states kaa darja dene vaali in dhaaraon ko khatm karne kii maang hameshaa raajnneeti ke centre main rahi he
 The hearing on the petition filed for the termination of Article 35A has been postponed till January next year
 usase pehle rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalakamohan bhagwatne bhi is masale par sangh kaa rukh jaahir kiya he
 On Wednesday, on the last day of the three-day program of the Sangh, Mohan Bhagwat said that the RSS does not accept Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution
 unhone saaf kaha ki yah vyavastha nahin honi chahie
 This idea of mohan Bhagwat comes from that resolution of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which says in the election manifesto to abolish Article 370
 saath hi anuchhed 35e khatm karne kii maang karne vaali jis yachika par sunwaayee court main sunwaayee chal rahi he, vah bhi bijepi netaa ashvini upaadhyaay ne daayar kii he
 On the other hand, when the BJP-PDP alliance was broken in Jammu and Kashmir recently, 35A was cited as a major reason by the PDP
 mahabuuba mufti ne baad main ye bayaan bhi diya ki unhone bijepi or piem modi ko dhara 35e se chhedchhad na karne kii taakid kii thi or is masale par koi bhi dakhal bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Explain that all the major regional parties including separatist leaders of Jammu and Kashmir have shown solidarity in support of 35A
 kya he anuchhed 35e?anuchhed 35e, jammu-kashmir ko rajya ke rup main vishesh adhikaar detaa he
 The rights granted under it are related to 'permanent residents'
 iskaa matlab he ki rajya sarkaar ko ye adhikaar he ki wo aazaadee ke vakt duusari jagahon se aae sharnaarthiyon or anya bhartiya nagarikon ko jammu-kashmir main kis tarah kii sahuliyatein den athwa nahin den
 According to Article 35A, if a girl from Jammu and Kashmir marries an outsider, then all her rights are lost
 saath hi uske bacchon ke adhikaar bhi khatm ho jate hai
 At the same time, a large number of refugees settled in different states after the independence of the country
 kashmir main bhi ye log aakar rahe
 But like the rest of the states, they were deprived of basic rights, this became a major reason for opposition to this article
 baharhaal, jo anuchhed 370 bijepi kaa chunavi mudda rahata he, use samaapt karne par mohan bhagwat ne saaf taur par samarthan diya he
 On the other hand, the government's position on 35A is not clear yet
 neshnal conferes netaa faruk abdulla bhi modi sarkaar se is masale par stand clear karne kii baat kah chuke hai
 While Mohan Bhagwat has supported abolition of both 370 and 35A

 Prime Minister Modi is busy in putting his great strength in the battle of Gujarat, in such a situation, the Congress is trying to bring the BJP to the backfoot by continuously attacking

 The face and character of Congress is the same as it was then
 congress ke DNA main immergency kaa samarthan he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said, Rahul Gandhi told himself that he will become the Prime Minister
 lekin congress ke kisi netaa ne unka samarthan nahin kiya
 If the Congress loses the election, the evms are blamed, the Election Commission is accused
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki aaj bhi congress nyaaypalika ke saath thik se vyavhaar nahin karti he
 The Congress that dealt with the judiciary behaved like an attempt to bully

 Intentionally try to deliver a message to the judiciary

 Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "even today, 43 years after the Emergency is still wounded
" us vakt sansad ko pangu kar diya gaya tha
 Every aspect of democracy was attacked
 ye hindustaniyon par hamalaa tha
 There was an attack on freedom of the press
 immergency ke samay bharat ke sabhi hai court ne saahas dikhaaya, lekin supreme court ne niraash kiya tha
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the black day of emergency should be included in the courses to tell the history of today's generation

 Not only this, no major leader has come for campaigning in Amritsar so far, although the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah is being heard
 yahaan tak ki shiromani akali dal, jisane 2014 main amritsar kii seat jetali ko thali main rakhkar 'parosane' ko vaada kiya tha, yahaan se nadaarad he
 Amidst all this, Puri can now only rely on the 'vision document', which he had prepared in Amritsar

 Party spokesman Rashid Alvi said, 'I have no information in this regard

 However a high-powered committee headed by Defense Minister AK Antony had considered the party's performance in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand

 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal has once again targeted Aam Aadmi Party MLA Sandeep Kumar, caught in the sex scandal
 unhone guuruuvaar ko kaha ki jis maamle main sandip kaa naam aa rahaa he, vah uski bhartsana karti hai
 Swati said that Sandeep should apologize instead of calling himself a 'dalit'
 disidblu kii adhyaksh ne sandip dwaara dalit card oochhaalane ke mudde par kaha, 'ye to behad sharmnaak he ki maafee maangane kii bajaaysandip kumarbachaav karte hue bol rahe hai ki wo dalit hai
 They should first apologize

 NCW sleeps throughout the year, now we are giving notice only if we wake up

 People like Sandeep Kumar should not be spared at all
 — Swati Maliwal (@swatijaihind)august 31, 2016 Indian batsmen commit five mistakes
 Headache of 1 front foot
 Most Indian batsmen are used to playing on flat pitches
 is vajah se front foot par aana unki aadat he
 On grass pitches, they do not get enough time to prepare themselves according to the speed, bounce and swing of the ball
 so ve akasar bich main dhar liye jate hai
 For example, Rohit Sharma, who played on the front foot in the ODI series, did not play his shots properly or he was not even covering the swing of the ball properly
 2 sidhe kandhe, badi museebatjab ballebaaj ke donon kandhe gendbaaj ke saamne hote hai, tab uske paas gend ko rokane ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin hota
 Take Yuvraj Singh only
 pehle vanade match main ve short pich gendon ko rokte hue lapak liye gaye the
 Ryan mclaren bowled the shoulder
 3 ye stroke-wo strokejab ballebaaj is baat ko lekar pakkaa nahin hota ki shandaar pes ko kaise jhele, yaa phir tej or oochaal vaali pichon par gend ko sahi samay par pick karne main naakaam rahata he, us samay vah ek saath kai chijen karne lagata he
 He tries to play many types of strokes to show mental strength
 jaise shikhar dhawan, jinhone van de main ulataa hamalaa bol gendbaajon par haaavee hone kii koshish kii
 The bat swinging outside the 4 off stump is a mistake that Indian batsmen often make
 ve of stump par balle ko hawa main rakhte hai, gend unke paas se guzarati he to duvidha main balla chalaane kii koshish karte hai, jisase slip yaa gali main aasaan shikaar ban jate hai
 Test opener Murali Vijay is out on similar occasions on most occasions
 5 dimag main ataki phansayah vah sthiti he, jisamen match shuru hone se pehle hi khilaadi haar maan lete hai
 Looking at the greenery on the South African pitches, Indian batsmen are expected to fall short of every ball
 apni jagajaahir takneekee khami kii vajah se suresh raina kii haalat ek tej gendbaaj ke saamne kisi nausikhua jaisi thi
 Whenever they come to bat, the bowler often bowls short balls
 galtiyaan sudhaarney ke paanch tareeke1 peeche haten, across khelenyah oochaal or tej gend ko khilne kaa behtareen tarika he
 This allows the batsman to look closely until the ball is bowled and reach the wicketkeeper and also get in the line of the ball
 2 said on isamen donon kandhe gendbaaj kii ek sidh main hote hai
 This gives the batsman a chance to stay in the line of the ball and he can also push the ball away from himself if needed
 3 gend chhodia seekhen unchi or baahar kii ore jaati gendon ko chhodia seekhen
 Remember that you should not be in a hurry to score runs in Tests
 bounsar ko chhodkar unhen nishprabhavi banaaen
 Ra Dravid, who is patient against fast balls, is the best role model for this
 4 joardaar cat maaren bounsar par ran banane kaa sabase asardaar tarika yah he ki gend ke neeche aaen, gend kii gati or oochaal kaa bharpoor phayda lete hue aisa joardaar cat maaren ki gend point-gali se baahar ho jaae
 Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag have mastered this
 5 darana manaa he aapane jo equipment pahan rakhe hai, un par bharosa rakhen or jarurat pade to sharir par jhelane ko bhi taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 After all, more than two bouncers will not come in an over
 mohinder amarnath 1980 ke dashak main west indies or pakistan ke tej gendbaajon ke aage aise hi karte hue chattan kii tarah date rahe
 How the Indian cricket system can prove to be helpful - International and domestic matches are played on pitches that are tough and grassy
 unamem oochaal bhi ho
 - Domestic cricket should be played on pitches that are not covered
 -under-16 cricket matting vikets par khelaa jaae (is par zyada oochaal or of da pich movement miltaa he ) jisase ki yuva apni baikfoot takanic ko nikhaar saken
 In the Under-19 and Under-16 tournaments, extra points should be given to the teams that bat for more than 100 overs
 age-group cricket main har over main do bounsar kii seemaa ko hataa diya jaae
 Special cricket related camps should be organized for the Indian team in such places where circumstances like foreign are found

 '' Senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said in the Rajya Sabha that wherever and wherever Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes, natural disasters occur every year in that country and state
 pramod tiwari ne to pradhanmantri narendra modi ko naseehat tak de daali ki agar vah uttarakhand or uttar pradesh kaa hit chaahate hai to vahaan na jaaen
 In the conversation till date, Pramod Tiwari said, 'so far there is a record that in non-bjp ruled states, the Prime Minister does not have a good eye
 nepal gaye to nepal main itnaa dardanaak bukamp aayaa ki abhi tak bhi vahaan ke log ubhar nahin paae hai
 If you went to America, how many storms came there that the names are falling short
 vahaan tufaan par tufaan aa rahe hai
 When he went to Afghanistan, there was an earthquake

 i have advised them that it is Dev Bhoomi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh is the land of Badri Kedar, do not go there
 unke kadam jahaan padate hai vahaan par prakritik apada aa jaati he
 When we asked Pramod Tiwari if it was okay for the Prime Minister of the country to say such things, that too in Rajya Sabha, Pramod Tiwari's answer was, 'I am a member of Rajya Sabha, so where else would i say my point
 maine to salaah di he
 Believe it or not, it is their job

 There is still time, you should go out of your homes and raise your voice against this project of rioting small sections of society
 bahut der ho chuki he or yah deree badhati ja rahi he
 a crowd is standing everywhere, which turns into a riot as soon as the video and audio is received through Whats Up
 hindu-muslim dibet ke zarie logon main barabari se zehar bharaa gaya he
 a spark of rumor takes the crowd to someone's locality and starts from looting to arson and murder
 hindu-muslim dibet ke centre main he ki kaise lagaataar bahason or propeganda ke zarie aapke man main musalamaanon ke prati nafrat bhar di jaae
 Be filled up so much that you start rioting with a rumor, so that the blame will come on the crowd and the leader will come among you like a saint
 puraa tantra laga hua he video share karne vaala
 He must be constantly asking you, you showed it, he did not show it
 bengal kaa dikhaaya, kerala kaa nahin dikhaaya
 Even if you show everywhere, he will return that he did not show it
 wo unheen baton ko dikhaane kii zid karegaa jinase nafrat faile
 He will never insist that please stop this hatred
 wo us maulavee kii baat ko dikhaane kii zid nahin karegaa jo apane bete kii maut ke baad bhi hinsa na karne kii baat karata he
 Surely there are people from both communities in this game of hate, but what to do, tell the system to act equally on everyone or spread hatred to show it
 system kahin bhi kisi ke saath insaaf nahin kar rahaa he
 Ask your children if there is such hatred in their minds, is there any hatred in the minds of their friends
 khud ko check kiijie ki kya aapke man main aisi nafrat he, ye main hinduon kii bhalaai ke liye kah rahaa hum
 If you hate your heart, you can be turned into a riot under some charge
 bananaa chahenge, aap yah bhi check kiijie ki aapke bacchon kaa dost koun he, wo kisi baaten karata he
 Stay away from hate uttarakhand ke rudprayag zile ke agastyamuni ilaake main ek phek video ko lekar hazaron log sadak par nikal aae
 You know that what is the condition of the investigation and the condition of the administration will never prove which organization was behind it, but what it showed is that on the basis of a fake video, a crowd of hundreds came out on the road and the law was in their hands Started taking ye jalati tasviren us kasbe kii hai jis kasbe kaa aisa mizaaj kabhi rahaa hi nahin
 Agasthyamuni, a small town in Kedarghati on the banks of the Mandakini river, where on Friday last a crowd of angry people came out on the streets and burnt many shops, houses
 in garm dimaag logon ne naa kuch dekha, naa samajha bas ek afawaah ko sach maan kasbe main maujuud kai musalamaanon kii dukaanon ko aag lagaate chale gaye
 They continued to break
 unamem rakhe saamaan ko phenkate rahe, kuch log unhen lut bhi le gaye
 This quiet town suddenly made headlines
 soshal media par bhi bina soch samajhe post par post daali jane lageen, jinamein alpsankhyakon ko nishaanaa banaaya jaataa rahaa
 The local minorities had suffered heavy losses before the police administration understood anything
 bijanour, saharanpur se kaarobaar karne aae musalamaanon kii kai dukaane bhi is gusse kaa shikaar ho chuki thim
 This proves that now people do not have to make a statement to the leader of any political party to create a riot, so much hatred has been instilled in you that after seeing a post on social media, you get blown up and become a rioter Go
 prashasan ko bhi der hui bataane main ki tasviir juthi he jab tak prashasan bataata ki video se kuch pramanit nahin ho rahaa he, tab tak dukaane jal gayi thim
 The objectionable photo posted on social media to incite violence shows a young man and half the body of a woman, not visible in the face and it is shown that the young man is a Muslim and the girl is a Hindu
 kaha jane laga ki yuvak ne ladki kaa balaatkaar kiya he
 On this matter, a fire of hatred spread in that town
 dhara 144 lagu kar di gai, shanivaar ko agastyamuni samet aasapaas ke pramukh kasbon main police kaa flag march kiya gaya
 By the time the DM cleared the picture and said that no one had reported the rape in this town and nothing was authenticated by the pictures in the video
 naukari series ke dauraan baar-baar kaha ki aapke bacchon ko dangai banaaya ja rahaa he
 We talked to the DM of Rudraprayag on this whole incident
 unhone jo bataaya or bheed jis baat ko lekar dangai ho gai donon main bahut antar tha
 The DM did not say which student organization is behind it, but he said that on Thursday evening, some people of the student organization and traders of the trade board brought three workers to the police station in Agastya Muni and said that they have made objectionable pictures of a girl
 And has threatened to put him on social media
 police is maamle kii jaanch kar hi rahi thi ki agle din 6 april ko kai yuva or vyapaar mandal ke log sadakon par utar aae or hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 On Friday evening, the girl came to the police and said that as she was returning home after playing, three workers stopped her and said that her objectionable pictures are with her and they will put her on social media
 ye kahkar wo use dhamkaane lage
 In this case, the police have arrested the three workers
 iske alaava in tasveeron ko galat tareeke se peshkar soshal media par daalane ke aarope main do logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Five people have been arrested so far on charges of arson and sabotage
 abhi vahaan shant he magar jinaki dukaane jali hai zaahir he wo maayoos hi honge, soch rahe honge ki ve kis baat ke liye gusse kaa shikaar hue
 Now you see these shops
 kedarnath hive par in dukaanon ko mazahab ke hisaab se chunaa gaya
 It had photographers, salons, ready-made clothes shops, cosmetic shops, hardware shops, poor vegetable shops
 yahaan hinduon kii bhi dukaane hai
 But by choosing the shops of a community, some belongings were looted, some were set on fire
 aisa karne vaali bheed ne yah bhi nahin sochaa ki pachis-tees saal se yahaan dukaane chal rahi hai
 What is angry about this is also not correct
 kisi kaa dhai lakh kaa nuksaan hua to kisi ko das lakh kaa
 The shop was looted after breaking the locks
 kuch dukandaar dukaan band kar bhaage, taaki jaan bachaa saken
 None of them are ready to talk on camera, because they are afraid
 susheel bahuguna, dinesh mansera or gajendra ji ne saare input die hai
 The fire-extinguishers were the Hindu shopkeepers of the neighborhood after the fire was over
 in sabko agastyamuni ke taane bane ke jal jane par gaharaa dukh he
 i am showing this story to know where hatred is taking us
 to hamane bharat ko yahaan tak pahunchaa diya
 The mob violence was nothing but hatred towards the minority community
 agar balaatkaar ko lekar hi gussa tha to bhi bheed ko koi haq nahin he ki wo kanoon haath main le
 In 2015, there were 34,651 cases of rape across India
 2016 main balaatkaar ke maamle main 12
 Increased by 4 percent
 is saal 38,947 maamle balaatkaar ke maamle darj hue
 Imagine if a mob comes behind every rape, then no city will be saved from burning
 gussa balaatkaar ko lekar tha yaa balaatkaar ke bahaane kisi samudaay ko nishaanaa banane kii ranneeti
 These are all questions, in answering them, you know where the courage is left in the system now
 ab ek aisi kahani bataata hum jahaan balaatkaar kii shikaar apni beti ko insaaf dilaane ke liye ek baap ne hi khud ko aag laga lee
 Those who have burnt shops in Uttarakhand should also come forward for this father, not to burn anyone's shop, to help in the fight for justice
 dangai dharm kii aad main dharm ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 When will you understand this much? system thik hota to kisi ke liye kanoon haath main lenaa aasaan nahin hota
 Neither for the mob nor for the alleged MLA and his brother
 yah bheed ek din aapke gharon kii taraf bhi aegi yaa aapke gharon se kisi ko apni taraf le jaaegi, kisi kaa ghar jalaane, kisi kii hatya karne
 Now you are stuck

 tasviren unke paitruk gaanv kanaila kii hai
 Rahul has said that ax has been taken at the root of religions and hence now even talk of religion reconciliation is sometimes heard, but is it possible? Religion does not teach hatred among themselves, what is the point of this white lie? If religion does not teach hatred, then why is our country ruined for this thousand years in the battle of top beard? Leave aside the old history, even today, in the cities and villages of India, who is making the religionists thirsty for the blood of other religious people? Who is fighting cow dung eaters
 kanaila gaanv main unki 125 veen jayanti par chota sa kaarykram hua
 He also has a daughter, Jaya Sankrityayan
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai ki do chaar log abhi bhi kisi ko yaad kar rahe hai, jisane aapako pehle hi yaad dilaa diya tha ki baton ko yaad rakho isse pehle ki dharm ke naam par aapkaa sab kuch jala diya jaae

 Due to this anger, the victim and her family came to Lucknow from Unnao and tried to kill themselves by burning them
 is maamle main 6 police adhikari suspend kiye gaye hai
 The accused MLA says that there is a conspiracy to tarnish his image
 ho saktaa he saazish ho magar pita kii maut kya unke bhai ke maarane se maut hui he

 You will also be in the same condition when you know that you will now have to live on a monthly pension of Rs 1800

 All these are older than me, but they have been so bitter while writing letters, there is so much frustration within them that i do not feel that i am talking to a citizen of India
 hindu muslim dibet aapaki naagarik shakti ko kuchal detaa he

 in muddon ke liye inase prabhavit logon ke alaava koi raajnneetik sanghathan jid nahin karata, dhamkee nahin detaa ki ye dikhaao tab maanege, hameshaa unheen baton ko lekar kyon kahata he jinase nafrat failati he ki ye dikhya wo nahin dikhaaya he
 It is equally worrying that since yesterday, the pension of the retired people of Grameen Bank should be increased from 1800 to do as much as it should be for living
 sibiai ke sab inspector kii jwining ke liye intazaakar kar rahe naujavaanon ko jwining letters de do
 At the center of the hindu-muslim debate is how to incite hatred towards Muslims through constant debates and propaganda
 itani bhar di jaae ki ek afvaah bhar se aap danga karne lag jaaen, taaki ilzaam bheed par aae or netaa aapke bich sant kii tarah aata rahe
 The entire system is installed for video sharing
 wo aapse lagaataar puch rahaa hoga, aapane iskaa dikhaaya, uskaa nahin dikhaaya
 Bengal was shown, Kerala was not shown
 sab jagah kaa dikhaa den tab bhi wo lautega ki ye nahin dikhaaya wo nahin dikhaaya
 He will insist on showing the same things that spread hatred
 wo kabhi zid nahin karegaa ki pleez is nafrat ko band karaao
 He will not insist on showing the talk of the cleric who talks about not committing violence even after the death of his son
 zarur nafrat ke is khel main donon samudaayon ke log hai, lekin kya kiya jaae, system se kaha jaae ki sab par barabari se karrwai karo yaa ise lekar nafrat failaai jaae ki ye dikhaao wo dikhaao
 The system is not judging anyone anywhere
 aap apane bacchon se puuchhie ki kya unke man main aisi koi nafrat he, kya unke doston ke man main nafrat he
 Check yourself whether you have such hatred, i am saying this for the benefit of Hindus
 agar aapke man main nafrat he to kisi aavesh main aapako dangai main badla ja saktaa he
 Want to make, you also check who is your children's friend, how he talks
 nafrat se dur rahiye
 Thousands of people came out on the road in Augustamuni area of rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand with a fake video
 aap jaanate hai ki jo jaanch kii haalat he or prashasan kii haalat he, kabhi sabit nahin hoga ki iske peeche koun sanghathan tha magar jo dikhaa vah yahi ki ek phek video ke aadhaar par sainkadon logon kii bheed sadak par nikal ai or kanoon apane haath main lene lagi
 These burning pictures are of a town that has never had such a mood
 mandakini nadi ke kinare kedarghati kaa ek chota kasbaa agastyamuni jahaan beete shuukravaar ko achaanak gussaye logon kii bheed sadakon par utar ai or kai dukaanon, gharon ko jalaati chali gai
 These hot-minded people did not see anything, did not think that just a rumor, they went on setting fire to many Muslim shops in the town
 unhen todate chale gaye
 They kept throwing away the things kept in them, some even took them away
 shant rahane vaala ye kasbaa achaanak surkiyon main aa gaya
 On social media too, posts started being posted on posts without thinking, in which minorities were targeted
 isse pehle ki police prashasan ko kuch samaj main aata sthaneey alpsankhyakon ko baari nuksaan ho chukaa tha
 Many shops of Muslims who came to do business from Bijnor, Saharanpur had also fallen victim to this anger
 yah sabit karata he ki ab logon ko dangai banane ke liye kisi raajnneetik dal ke netaa ko bayaan dene kii zarurat nahin he, aapke bheetar itani nafrat bhar di gai he ki aap soshal media par ek post dekhte hi aag babula ho uthte hai or dangai ban jate hai
 The administration was also late in stating that the picture was false, shops were burnt until the administration told that nothing was being authenticated by the video
 hinsa bhadakaane ke liye soshal media par jo aapattijanak photo post kiya gaya usamen ek yuvak or yuvati ke aadhe sharir dikh rahe hai, chehre tak nahin dikh rahe or ise aise dikhaaya gaya jaise yuvak musalmaan he or ladki hindu
 It is said that the young man raped the girl
 itani si baat par us kasbe main nafrat kii aag fail gai
 Section 144 was enacted, a flag march of police was carried out on Saturday in nearby major towns including Agastyamuni
 jab tak dm ne tasviir saaf kii or kaha ki is kasbe main balaatkaar kii kisi kii ne report bhi nahin karai he or video kii tasveeron se kuch bhi pramanit nahin hota he
 During the job series, he repeatedly said that your children are being rioted
 is puri ghatana par hamane rudraprayag ke dm se baat kii
 There was a lot of difference between what he told and what the crowd was rioting about
 dm ne nahin bataaya ki koun sa chaatr sanghathan iske peeche he, magar unhone kaha ki guuruuvaar shaam chaatr sanghathan ke kuch log or vyapaar mandal ke vyapaaree teen mazaduron ko agastya muni main thane main lekar aae or kaha ki inhone ek ladki kii aapattijanak tasviir banaai he or use soshal media par daalane kii dhamkee di he
 The police were investigating the matter that the following day, on 6 April, many youth and business people came out on the streets and started a commotion
 shuukravaar shaam ko wo ladki police ke paas ai or usne kaha ki jab wo khelkar ghar laut rahi thi to teen mazaduron ne use roka or kaha ki uski aapattijanak tasviren unke paas hai or wo use soshal media par daal denge
 Saying this, he started threatening her
 is maamle main police ne teenon mazaduron ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Apart from this, two people have been arrested on charges of putting these pictures on social media by presenting them incorrectly
 paanch logon ko aagzani or todphod ke aarope main ab tak giraftaar kiya gaya he
 It is quiet there now, but those whose shops are burnt, it is obvious that they will be disappointed, wondering what they were angry for
 ab aap in dukaanon ko dekhie
 These shops on the Kedarnath highway were chosen according to the religion
 yahaan par photographer, salon, redimaid kapadon kii dukaan thi, cosmetic kii dukaan thi, hardware kii dukaan thi, sabji bechney vaale garib kii bhi dukaan thi
 There are also shops of Hindus here
 magar ek samudaay kii dukaanon ko chunakar kisi kaa saamaan lutaa gaya, kisi main aag laga di gai
 The crowd doing this did not even think that shops have been operating here for twenty-five years
 jis baat par gussa hai wo baat bhi sahi nahin he
 If someone has a loss of two and a half lakhs, then a loss of ten lakhs dukaan ke taale tod kar saamaan nikaalkar lutaa gaya
 Some shopkeepers ran away from the shop to save their lives
 inamen se koi camere par baat karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he, kyonki inhen dar he
 Sushil Bahuguna, Dinesh Mansera and Gajendra ji have given all inputs
 aag lagane vaali bheed ke ja chukne ke baad jo aag buja rahe ve pados ke hindu dukandaar the
 All of them are deeply saddened by the burning of the weft of Agastyamuni
 yah story isliye dikhaa rahaa hum taaki pataa chale ki nafrat hamen kahaan lekar ja rahi he
 So we have brought India to this point
 bheed kii hinsa ke peeche alpsankhyak samudaay ke prati bhari gai nafrat ke alaav kuch nahin tha
 Even if there was anger about rape, the crowd has no right to take that law in their hands
 2015 main bharat bhar main balaatkaar ke 34, 651 maamle dard hue the
 12 in 2016 rape case
 4 pratishat kii vruddhi ho gai
 This year, 38,947 cases of rape were reported
 sochie agar har balaatkaar ke peeche bheed aa jaae to koi shahar jalane se nahin bachegaa
 Anger was about rape or a strategy to target a community on the pretext of rape
 yah sab sawaal he, jinka jawaab dene main aap jaanate hai ki ab kahaan system main himmat bachi he
 Now let me tell a story where a father set himself on fire in order to bring justice to his daughter, a victim of rape
 uttarakhand main jin logon ne dukaane jalaayin hai, unhen is baap ke liye bhi aage aana chahie, kisi kii dukaan jalaane ke liye nahin, insaaf kii ladaai main madad ke liye
 Rioters are defaming religion under the guise of religion
 itani baat aap kab samajhenge
 Had the system been right, it would not have been easy for anyone to take the law into their hands
 na bheed ke liye na kathith rup se vidhayak or unke bhai ke liye
 One day this mob will also come towards your houses or will take someone from your houses, burning someone's house, killing someone
 ab aap funs gaye hai
 Today is the 125th birth anniversary of Rahul Sankrityayan
 rahul hindi ke bade sahityakar or bade ghumkkad the
 Knowledgeable in about thirty languages, he wrote more than 100 books on various subjects like literature, philosophy, politics etc

 Today some journalists have visited his village on the occasion of Jayanti
 shambhunath shukla or prakaash ke re ne vahaan se tasviren bheji hai
 What this scholar Yayawar had also said on the violence of religion, you are seeing this happening even today unheen ke ek lekh kaa hissaa he jo 'da vir' main chapa he
 The pictures are of his ancestral village Kanaila
 rahul ne kaha he ki dharmon kii jad main kulhadi lag gaya he or isliye ab mazahabon ke mail-milaap kii bhi baaten kabhi-kabhi sunne main aati hai, lekin kya yah sambhav he? mazahab nahin sikhaata aapas main bair rakhana, is safed jhooth kaa kya thikaana he? agar mazahab bair nahin sikhalaataa to chotii dadhi kii ladaai main yah hazaar baras se aaj tak hamaara mulk barbaad kyon he? puraane itihaas ko chhod dijie, aaj bhi hindustan ke shaharon or gaanvon main ek mazahab waalon ko duusare mazahab baalo ke koon kaa pyaasa koun bana rahaa he? koun gaay khaane waalon se gobar khaane waalon ko ladaa rahaa he
 a small program took place on his 125th birth anniversary in Kanaila village
 unki beti jaya sankrutyaayan bhi hai
 You can see in these pictures that two or four people are still remembering someone, who had already reminded you to remember things before you burn everything in the name of religion
 8 april kii dopaher upi ke mukhyamantri ke awaas ke saamne ek ladki ne khud ko aag laga lee
 She wanted to die because she says she was gangraped
 maamle ke waapas lene ke liye pita ko pratadit kiya gaya or pita kii maut ho gai
 The girl accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar of gangrape
 ek aarope yah bhi he ki mukadmaa waapas na lene par vidhayak ke bhai ne 3 april ko uske pita ko berahami se peeta
 The police did not register a case against the MLA, but the police filed a case against the victim and the family itself and sent the father to jail in a wounded condition
 is rosh ke kaaran peedita or uske parivaar ke log unnav se lakhanu aae or khud ko jalaakar maarane kii koshish kii
 Six police officers have been suspended in this case
 aaropee vidhayak kaa kahana he ki unki chhavi karaab karne kii saazish ho rahi he
 There may be intrigue, but the father's death is the death of his brother
 ek baar aap system ke paas jaaiye, wo hindu ho yaa muslim donon ko baraabar se tod detaa he
 No one has returned from his inner injustice without being discouraged
 aap un yuvaaon se baat kiijie jo esayssi kii sijiel 2016 kii pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Among them will be Hindus and also Muslims
 agast 2017 main hi paas kar gaye the magar tarah-tarah kii prakriyaaon ke naam se aath maheene ho gaye magar xining nahin ho rahi he
 Their number is more than a hundred and all these were elected to the Sub Inspector of CBI
 yahi nahin 2012 main bhi kuch log chune gaye the jo court main cese lard rahe hai jwining ke liye
 They call the CBI office, some get some answers but the joining letter is not available
 7 maheene bagaiyr kisi vetan ke ghar baithe hai
 His voice has become cuteness
 esayssi kii pariksha se paas hue chaatr jo film division vibhaag ke liye chune gaye the ve bhi apni jwining ko lekar pareshaan hai
 We have raised his point many times in our series
 sarkaar hi samay par apana vaada puraa nahin karti he
 Everything is starting to get so fast, so why is there such a delay in their jobs
 aap inase puuchhie ki tivi par kya dekhnaa chaahate ho yahi kahenge ki naukari series
 We need a job gramin bank se ritair hue ek adhikari ne bhi patr likhaa he
 How ripe
 aapaki bhi vahi haalat ho jaaegi jab pataa chalegaa ki aapako ab 1800 rupee ke masik pension par rahanaa hoga
 Last salary 1 lakh and 1800 next month of retirement
 ye sab mujhase umr main bade hai, magar patr likhte hue itane kaatar ho chuke hai, inke bheetar itani niraashaa bhar gai he ki mujhe lagata nahin ki main bharat ke naagarik se baat kar rahaa hum
 Hindu Muslim debate crushes your civil power
 yaa to bheed banakar mar jaaiye yaa bheed banakar kisi ko maar dijie
 This is the destiny of many
 kitna dukhad he
 The comments sarkaar kaa koi mantri bataa sakate hai jo inhen insaaf dilaa saktaa he, aap hi bataa dijie vaise ye sabake yahaan jaakar twit kar chuke hai
 Your India has changed a lot
 aapane badalane kaise diya
 Since April 3, the Rohtak Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, MBI of PGI and interns of BDS have been sitting on dharna
 ye tarah tarah se andolan kar rahe hai taaki prashasan inaki baat sun le
 They say that they get an allowance of 12000 per month, while the rest of the central institutions get 17,900
 unhen bhi 17,900 rupee masik bhatta diya jaae
 They are protesting for 24 hours for seven days
 pijiai rohtak ke samarthan main haryana ke kai sarkari medical college ke 2500 se adhik medical intern or chaatr hadtaal par chale gaye hai
 All medical colleges of Haryana are under the Pandit BD Sharma University of Health and Science of Rohtak
 inkaa kahana he ki ames ke opidi main 12,000 mariz aate hai or pijiai kii opidi main 10,000 mariz aate hai
 There is not much difference in the number but AIIMS interns get Rs 17,900 monthly and only 12000 in Rohtak PGI
 haryana main mazaduron kii dihadi 480 rupee he or medical intern ko rose ke 400 milte hai
 No political organization other than those affected by these issues insists, does not threaten that they will show up, then why does it always say the same things that spread hatred that it has not shown
 itani hi phikr he to kal se gramin bank ke ritair logon kii pension 1800 se badhaakar itnaa to kar do jitna jeene ke liye chahie
 Give the joining letter to the youth making arrangements for joining the CBI sub-inspector
 system kahin bhi kisi ke saath insaaf nahin kar rahaa he
 Ask your children if there is such hatred in their minds, is there any hatred in the minds of their friends
 khud ko check kiijie ki kya aapke man main aisi nafrat he, ye main hinduon kii bhalaai ke liye kah rahaa hum
 If you hate your heart, you can be turned into a riot under some charge
 bananaa chahenge, aap yah bhi check kiijie ki aapke bacchon kaa dost koun he, wo kisi baaten karata he
 Stay away from hate uttarakhand ke rudprayag zile ke agastyamuni ilaake main ek phek video ko lekar hazaron log sadak par nikal aae
 You know that what is the condition of the investigation and the condition of the administration will never prove which organization was behind it, but what it showed is that on the basis of a fake video, a crowd of hundreds came out on the road and the law was in their hands Started taking ye jalati tasviren us kasbe kii hai jis kasbe kaa aisa mizaaj kabhi rahaa hi nahin
 Agasthyamuni, a small town in Kedarghati on the banks of the Mandakini river, where on Friday last a crowd of angry people came out on the streets and burnt many shops, houses
 in garm dimaag logon ne naa kuch dekha, naa samajha bas ek afawaah ko sach maan kasbe main maujuud kai musalamaanon kii dukaanon ko aag lagaate chale gaye
 They continued to break
 unamem rakhe saamaan ko phenkate rahe, kuch log unhen lut bhi le gaye
 This quiet town suddenly made headlines
 soshal media par bhi bina soch samajhe post par post daali jane lageen, jinamein alpsankhyakon ko nishaanaa banaaya jaataa rahaa
 The local minorities had suffered heavy losses before the police administration understood anything
 bijanour, saharanpur se kaarobaar karne aae musalamaanon kii kai dukaane bhi is gusse kaa shikaar ho chuki thim
 This proves that now people do not have to make a statement to the leader of any political party to create a riot, so much hatred has been instilled in you that after seeing a post on social media, you get blown up and become a rioter Go
 prashasan ko bhi der hui bataane main ki tasviir juthi he jab tak prashasan bataata ki video se kuch pramanit nahin ho rahaa he, tab tak dukaane jal gayi thim
 The objectionable photo posted on social media to incite violence shows a young man and half the body of a woman, not visible in the face and it is shown that the young man is a Muslim and the girl is a Hindu
 kaha jane laga ki yuvak ne ladki kaa balaatkaar kiya he
 On this matter, a fire of hatred spread in that town
 dhara 144 lagu kar di gai, shanivaar ko agastyamuni samet aasapaas ke pramukh kasbon main police kaa flag march kiya gaya
 By the time the DM cleared the picture and said that no one had reported the rape in this town and nothing was authenticated by the pictures in the video
 naukari series ke dauraan baar-baar kaha ki aapke bacchon ko dangai banaaya ja rahaa he
 We talked to the DM of Rudraprayag on this whole incident
 unhone jo bataaya or bheed jis baat ko lekar dangai ho gai donon main bahut antar tha
 The DM did not say which student organization is behind it, but he said that on Thursday evening, some people of the student organization and traders of the trade board brought three workers to the police station in Agastya Muni and said that they have made objectionable pictures of a girl
 And has threatened to put him on social media
 police is maamle kii jaanch kar hi rahi thi ki agle din 6 april ko kai yuva or vyapaar mandal ke log sadakon par utar aae or hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 On Friday evening, the girl came to the police and said that as she was returning home after playing, three workers stopped her and said that her objectionable pictures are with her and they will put her on social media
 ye kahkar wo use dhamkaane lage
 In this case, the police have arrested the three workers
 iske alaava in tasveeron ko galat tareeke se peshkar soshal media par daalane ke aarope main do logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Five people have been arrested so far on charges of arson and sabotage
 abhi vahaan shant he magar jinaki dukaane jali hai zaahir he wo maayoos hi honge, soch rahe honge ki ve kis baat ke liye gusse kaa shikaar hue
 Now you see these shops
 kedarnath hive par in dukaanon ko mazahab ke hisaab se chunaa gaya
 It had photographers, salons, ready-made clothes shops, cosmetic shops, hardware shops, poor vegetable shops
 yahaan hinduon kii bhi dukaane hai
 But by choosing the shops of a community, some belongings were looted, some were set on fire
 aisa karne vaali bheed ne yah bhi nahin sochaa ki pachis-tees saal se yahaan dukaane chal rahi hai
 What is angry about this is also not correct
 kisi kaa dhai lakh kaa nuksaan hua to kisi ko das lakh kaa
 The shop was looted after breaking the locks
 kuch dukandaar dukaan band kar bhaage, taaki jaan bachaa saken
 None of them are ready to talk on camera, because they are afraid
 susheel bahuguna, dinesh mansera or gajendra ji ne saare input die hai
 The fire-extinguishers were the Hindu shopkeepers of the neighborhood after the fire was over
 in sabko agastyamuni ke taane bane ke jal jane par gaharaa dukh he
 i am showing this story to know where hatred is taking us
 to hamane bharat ko yahaan tak pahunchaa diya
 The mob violence was nothing but hatred towards the minority community
 agar balaatkaar ko lekar hi gussa tha to bhi bheed ko koi haq nahin he ki wo kanoon haath main le
 In 2015, there were 34,651 cases of rape across India
 2016 main balaatkaar ke maamle main 12
 Increased by 4 percent
 is saal 38,947 maamle balaatkaar ke maamle darj hue
 Imagine if a mob comes behind every rape, then no city will be saved from burning
 gussa balaatkaar ko lekar tha yaa balaatkaar ke bahaane kisi samudaay ko nishaanaa banane kii ranneeti
 These are all questions, in answering them, you know where the courage is left in the system now
 ab ek aisi kahani bataata hum jahaan balaatkaar kii shikaar apni beti ko insaaf dilaane ke liye ek baap ne hi khud ko aag laga lee
 Those who have burnt shops in Uttarakhand should also come forward for this father, not to burn anyone's shop, to help in the fight for justice
 dangai dharm kii aad main dharm ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 When will you understand this much? system thik hota to kisi ke liye kanoon haath main lenaa aasaan nahin hota
 Neither for the mob nor for the alleged MLA and his brother
 yah bheed ek din aapke gharon kii taraf bhi aegi yaa aapke gharon se kisi ko apni taraf le jaaegi, kisi kaa ghar jalaane, kisi kii hatya karne
 Now you are stuck
 aaj rahul sankrutyaayan kii 125veen jayanti he
 Rahul was a great Hindi litterateur and a big wanderer
 lagbhag tees bhashaaon ke jaankaar the, sahitya, darshan, raajnneeti ityadi vividh vishyon par unhone 100 se adhik kitaaben likhin
 He brought rare manuscripts from Tibet to India
 jayanti ke maukey par aaj unke gaanv kuch patrkaar gaye hai
 Shambhunath Shukla and Prakash k Ray have sent photographs from there
 is vidwaan yaayavar ne bhi dharm kii hinsa par jo kaha tha, aaj bhi aap hota hua dekh rahe hai It is part of an article written by him in 'the Wire'
 tasviren unke paitruk gaanv kanaila kii hai
 Rahul has said that ax has been taken at the root of religions and hence now even talk of religion reconciliation is sometimes heard, but is it possible? Religion does not teach hatred among themselves, what is the point of this white lie? If religion does not teach hatred, then why is our country ruined for this thousand years in the battle of top beard? Leave aside the old history, even today, in the cities and villages of India, who is making the religionists thirsty for the blood of other religious people? Who is fighting cow dung eaters
 kanaila gaanv main unki 125 veen jayanti par chota sa kaarykram hua
 He also has a daughter, Jaya Sankrityayan
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai ki do chaar log abhi bhi kisi ko yaad kar rahe hai, jisane aapako pehle hi yaad dilaa diya tha ki baton ko yaad rakho isse pehle ki dharm ke naam par aapkaa sab kuch jala diya jaae
 On the afternoon of 8 April, a girl set herself on fire in front of the UP Chief Minister's residence
 vah jalakar mar janaa chaahati thi kyonki uskaa kahana he ki uske saath gangrape hua
 The father is tortured and the father dies to withdraw the case
 is ladki ne gangrape kaa aarope bijepi ke vidhayak kuldeep singh senger par lagaaya tha
 There is also an allegation that the mla's brother brutally beat his father on 3 April for not withdrawing the case
 police ne vidhayak par cese darj nahi kiya balki police ne peedita or parivaar par hi cese kar diya or pita ko zakhmi haalat main jail bhej diya
 Due to this anger, the victim and her family came to Lucknow from Unnao and tried to kill themselves by burning them
 is maamle main 6 police adhikari suspend kiye gaye hai
 The accused MLA says that there is a conspiracy to tarnish his image
 ho saktaa he saazish ho magar pita kii maut kya unke bhai ke maarane se maut hui he
 Once you go to the system, it breaks both Hindus or Muslims equally
 uske bheetar kii ninsafiyon se koi bagair hataash hue nahin lautaa he
 Talk to those youths who are waiting for joining SSC CGL 2016 exam
 inamen hindu bhi honge or muslim bhi
 We had passed in August 2017 but it has been eight months in the name of various procedures but there is no joining
 inaki sankhya sau se adhik he or ye sabhi sibiai ke sab inspector ke liye chune gaye the
 Not only this, some people were also elected in 2012 who are contesting the case in court for joining
 ye sibiai ke daftar phone karte hai, kuch kaa kuch jawaab miltaa he magar jwining kii chitthee nahin milti he
 7 months sitting at home without any salary
 unki awaz main kaatarata aa gai he
 Students who passed the SSC examination, who were selected for the film division department, are also worried about their joining
 hamane apni series main inaki baat kai baar uthaai he
 The government itself does not fulfill its promise on time
 sab kuch itnaa fast hone laga he to inaki naukari main itani deree kyon ho rahi he
 Ask them what you want to see on TV, they will say that the job series
 hamen naukari chahie
 An officer who retired from Grameen Bank has also written a letter
 kitni kaatarata bhari he
 You will also be in the same condition when you know that you will now have to live on a monthly pension of Rs 1800
 aakhri selary 1 lakh or ritairement ke agle maheene 1800
 All these are older than me, but they have been so bitter while writing letters, there is so much frustration within them that i do not feel that i am talking to a citizen of India
 hindu muslim dibet aapaki naagarik shakti ko kuchal detaa he
 Either die as a mob or kill someone as a mob
 yahi bahuton kii niyati he
 How sad tippaniyan Any minister of the government can tell who can give justice to them, you can tell them that they have all gone and tweeted here
 aapkaa bharat bahut badal gaya he
 How did you let change 3 april se rohtak post graduate institute of medical sciences, pijiai ke embibies or bidies ke intern dharne par baithe hai
 They are agitating in such a way so that the administration listens to them
 inkaa kahana he ki inhen har maheene 12000 kaa bhatta miltaa he, jabaki baaki kendriya sansthaanon main 17,900 miltaa he
 They should also be given a monthly allowance of Rs 17,900
 saat dinon se 24 ghante ye dharna de rahe hai
 In support of PGI Rohtak, more than 2500 medical interns and students of many government medical colleges of Haryana have gone on strike
 haryana ke sabhi medical college rohtak ke pandit bidi sharma uniwarsity of health and science ke tahat aate hai
 They say that 12,000 patients fall in AIIMS OPD and 10,000 patients in PGI OPD
 sankhya main bahut antar nahin he lekin ames ke intern ko 17,900 rupee masik miltaa he or rohtak pijiai main 12000 hi miltaa he
 The daily wage of laborers in Haryana is Rs 480 and the medical intern gets 400 daily
 in muddon ke liye inase prabhavit logon ke alaava koi raajnneetik sanghathan jid nahin karata, dhamkee nahin detaa ki ye dikhaao tab maanege, hameshaa unheen baton ko lekar kyon kahata he jinase nafrat failati he ki ye dikhya wo nahin dikhaaya he
 It is equally worrying that since yesterday, the pension of the retired people of Grameen Bank should be increased from 1800 to do as much as it should be for living
 sibiai ke sab inspector kii jwining ke liye intazaakar kar rahe naujavaanon ko jwining letters de do
 Thousands of people came out on the road in Augustamuni area of rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand with a fake video
 aap jaanate hai ki jo jaanch kii haalat he or prashasan kii haalat he, kabhi sabit nahin hoga ki iske peeche koun sanghathan tha magar jo dikhaa vah yahi ki ek phek video ke aadhaar par sainkadon logon kii bheed sadak par nikal ai or kanoon apane haath main lene lagi
 These burning pictures are of a town that has never had such a mood
 mandakini nadi ke kinare kedarghati kaa ek chota kasbaa agastyamuni jahaan beete shuukravaar ko achaanak gussaye logon kii bheed sadakon par utar ai or kai dukaanon, gharon ko jalaati chali gai
 These hot-minded people did not see anything, did not think that just a rumor, they went on setting fire to many Muslim shops in the town
 unhen todate chale gaye
 They kept throwing away the things kept in them, some even took them away
 shant rahane vaala ye kasbaa achaanak surkiyon main aa gaya
 On social media too, posts started being posted on posts without thinking, in which minorities were targeted
 isse pehle ki police prashasan ko kuch samaj main aata sthaneey alpsankhyakon ko baari nuksaan ho chukaa tha
 Many shops of Muslims who came to do business from Bijnor, Saharanpur had also fallen victim to this anger
 yah sabit karata he ki ab logon ko dangai banane ke liye kisi raajnneetik dal ke netaa ko bayaan dene kii zarurat nahin he, aapke bheetar itani nafrat bhar di gai he ki aap soshal media par ek post dekhte hi aag babula ho uthte hai or dangai ban jate hai
 The administration was also late in stating that the picture was false, shops were burnt until the administration told that nothing was being authenticated by the video
 hinsa bhadakaane ke liye soshal media par jo aapattijanak photo post kiya gaya usamen ek yuvak or yuvati ke aadhe sharir dikh rahe hai, chehre tak nahin dikh rahe or ise aise dikhaaya gaya jaise yuvak musalmaan he or ladki hindu
 It is said that the young man raped the girl
 itani si baat par us kasbe main nafrat kii aag fail gai
 Section 144 was enacted, a flag march of police was carried out on Saturday in nearby major towns including Agastyamuni
 jab tak dm ne tasviir saaf kii or kaha ki is kasbe main balaatkaar kii kisi kii ne report bhi nahin karai he or video kii tasveeron se kuch bhi pramanit nahin hota he
 During the job series, he repeatedly said that your children are being rioted
 is puri ghatana par hamane rudraprayag ke dm se baat kii
 There was a lot of difference between what he told and what the crowd was rioting about
 dm ne nahin bataaya ki koun sa chaatr sanghathan iske peeche he, magar unhone kaha ki guuruuvaar shaam chaatr sanghathan ke kuch log or vyapaar mandal ke vyapaaree teen mazaduron ko agastya muni main thane main lekar aae or kaha ki inhone ek ladki kii aapattijanak tasviir banaai he or use soshal media par daalane kii dhamkee di he
 The police were investigating the matter that the following day, on 6 April, many youth and business people came out on the streets and started a commotion
 shuukravaar shaam ko wo ladki police ke paas ai or usne kaha ki jab wo khelkar ghar laut rahi thi to teen mazaduron ne use roka or kaha ki uski aapattijanak tasviren unke paas hai or wo use soshal media par daal denge
 Saying this, he started threatening her
 is maamle main police ne teenon mazaduron ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Apart from this, two people have been arrested on charges of putting these pictures on social media by presenting them incorrectly
 paanch logon ko aagzani or todphod ke aarope main ab tak giraftaar kiya gaya he
 It is quiet there now, but those whose shops are burnt, it is obvious that they will be disappointed, wondering what they were angry for
 ab aap in dukaanon ko dekhie
 These shops on the Kedarnath highway were chosen according to the religion
 yahaan par photographer, salon, redimaid kapadon kii dukaan thi, cosmetic kii dukaan thi, hardware kii dukaan thi, sabji bechney vaale garib kii bhi dukaan thi
 There are also shops of Hindus here
 magar ek samudaay kii dukaanon ko chunakar kisi kaa saamaan lutaa gaya, kisi main aag laga di gai
 The crowd doing this did not even think that shops have been operating here for twenty-five years
 jis baat par gussa hai wo baat bhi sahi nahin he
 If someone has a loss of two and a half lakhs, then a loss of ten lakhs dukaan ke taale tod kar saamaan nikaalkar lutaa gaya
 Some shopkeepers ran away from the shop to save their lives
 inamen se koi camere par baat karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he, kyonki inhen dar he
 Sushil Bahuguna, Dinesh Mansera and Gajendra ji have given all inputs
 aag lagane vaali bheed ke ja chukne ke baad jo aag buja rahe ve pados ke hindu dukandaar the
 All of them are deeply saddened by the burning of the weft of Agastyamuni
 yah story isliye dikhaa rahaa hum taaki pataa chale ki nafrat hamen kahaan lekar ja rahi he
 So we have brought India to this point
 bheed kii hinsa ke peeche alpsankhyak samudaay ke prati bhari gai nafrat ke alaav kuch nahin tha
 Even if there was anger about rape, the crowd has no right to take that law in their hands
 2015 main bharat bhar main balaatkaar ke 34, 651 maamle dard hue the
 12 in 2016 rape case
 4 pratishat kii vruddhi ho gai
 This year, 38,947 cases of rape were reported
 sochie agar har balaatkaar ke peeche bheed aa jaae to koi shahar jalane se nahin bachegaa
 Anger was about rape or a strategy to target a community on the pretext of rape
 yah sab sawaal he, jinka jawaab dene main aap jaanate hai ki ab kahaan system main himmat bachi he
 Now let me tell a story where a father set himself on fire in order to bring justice to his daughter, a victim of rape
 uttarakhand main jin logon ne dukaane jalaayin hai, unhen is baap ke liye bhi aage aana chahie, kisi kii dukaan jalaane ke liye nahin, insaaf kii ladaai main madad ke liye
 Rioters are defaming religion under the guise of religion
 itani baat aap kab samajhenge
 Had the system been right, it would not have been easy for anyone to take the law into their hands
 na bheed ke liye na kathith rup se vidhayak or unke bhai ke liye
 One day this mob will also come towards your houses or will take someone from your houses, burning someone's house, killing someone
 ab aap funs gaye hai

 Today some journalists have visited his village on the occasion of Jayanti
 shambhunath shukla or prakaash ke re ne vahaan se tasviren bheji hai
 What this scholar Yayawar had also said on the violence of religion, you are seeing this happening even today unheen ke ek lekh kaa hissaa he jo 'da vir' main chapa he
 The pictures are of his ancestral village Kanaila
 rahul ne kaha he ki dharmon kii jad main kulhadi lag gaya he or isliye ab mazahabon ke mail-milaap kii bhi baaten kabhi-kabhi sunne main aati hai, lekin kya yah sambhav he? mazahab nahin sikhaata aapas main bair rakhana, is safed jhooth kaa kya thikaana he? agar mazahab bair nahin sikhalaataa to chotii dadhi kii ladaai main yah hazaar baras se aaj tak hamaara mulk barbaad kyon he? puraane itihaas ko chhod dijie, aaj bhi hindustan ke shaharon or gaanvon main ek mazahab waalon ko duusare mazahab baalo ke koon kaa pyaasa koun bana rahaa he? koun gaay khaane waalon se gobar khaane waalon ko ladaa rahaa he
 a small program took place on his 125th birth anniversary in Kanaila village
 unki beti jaya sankrutyaayan bhi hai
 You can see in these pictures that two or four people are still remembering someone, who had already reminded you to remember things before you burn everything in the name of religion
 8 april kii dopaher upi ke mukhyamantri ke awaas ke saamne ek ladki ne khud ko aag laga lee
 She wanted to die because she says she was gangraped
 maamle ke waapas lene ke liye pita ko pratadit kiya gaya or pita kii maut ho gai
 The girl accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar of gangrape
 ek aarope yah bhi he ki mukadmaa waapas na lene par vidhayak ke bhai ne 3 april ko uske pita ko berahami se peeta
 The police did not register a case against the MLA, but the police filed a case against the victim and the family itself and sent the father to jail in a wounded condition
 is rosh ke kaaran peedita or uske parivaar ke log unnav se lakhanu aae or khud ko jalaakar maarane kii koshish kii
 Six police officers have been suspended in this case
 aaropee vidhayak kaa kahana he ki unki chhavi karaab karne kii saazish ho rahi he
 There may be intrigue, but the father's death is the death of his brother
 ek baar aap system ke paas jaaiye, wo hindu ho yaa muslim donon ko baraabar se tod detaa he
 No one has returned from his inner injustice without being discouraged
 aap un yuvaaon se baat kiijie jo esayssi kii sijiel 2016 kii pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Among them will be Hindus and also Muslims
 agast 2017 main hi paas kar gaye the magar tarah-tarah kii prakriyaaon ke naam se aath maheene ho gaye magar xining nahin ho rahi he
 Their number is more than a hundred and all these were elected to the Sub Inspector of CBI
 yahi nahin 2012 main bhi kuch log chune gaye the jo court main cese lard rahe hai jwining ke liye
 They call the CBI office, some get some answers but the joining letter is not available
 7 maheene bagaiyr kisi vetan ke ghar baithe hai
 His voice has become cuteness
 esayssi kii pariksha se paas hue chaatr jo film division vibhaag ke liye chune gaye the ve bhi apni jwining ko lekar pareshaan hai
 We have raised his point many times in our series
 sarkaar hi samay par apana vaada puraa nahin karti he
 Everything is starting to get so fast, so why is there such a delay in their jobs
 aap inase puuchhie ki tivi par kya dekhnaa chaahate ho yahi kahenge ki naukari series
 We need a job gramin bank se ritair hue ek adhikari ne bhi patr likhaa he
 How ripe
 aapaki bhi vahi haalat ho jaaegi jab pataa chalegaa ki aapako ab 1800 rupee ke masik pension par rahanaa hoga
 Last salary 1 lakh and 1800 next month of retirement
 ye sab mujhase umr main bade hai, magar patr likhte hue itane kaatar ho chuke hai, inke bheetar itani niraashaa bhar gai he ki mujhe lagata nahin ki main bharat ke naagarik se baat kar rahaa hum
 Hindu Muslim debate crushes your civil power
 yaa to bheed banakar mar jaaiye yaa bheed banakar kisi ko maar dijie
 This is the destiny of many
 kitna dukhad he
 The comments sarkaar kaa koi mantri bataa sakate hai jo inhen insaaf dilaa saktaa he, aap hi bataa dijie vaise ye sabake yahaan jaakar twit kar chuke hai
 Your India has changed a lot
 aapane badalane kaise diya
 Since April 3, the Rohtak Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, MBI of PGI and interns of BDS have been sitting on dharna
 ye tarah tarah se andolan kar rahe hai taaki prashasan inaki baat sun le
 They say that they get an allowance of 12000 per month, while the rest of the central institutions get 17,900
 unhen bhi 17,900 rupee masik bhatta diya jaae
 They are protesting for 24 hours for seven days
 pijiai rohtak ke samarthan main haryana ke kai sarkari medical college ke 2500 se adhik medical intern or chaatr hadtaal par chale gaye hai
 All medical colleges of Haryana are under the Pandit BD Sharma University of Health and Science of Rohtak
 inkaa kahana he ki ames ke opidi main 12,000 mariz aate hai or pijiai kii opidi main 10,000 mariz aate hai
 There is not much difference in the number but AIIMS interns get Rs 17,900 monthly and only 12000 in Rohtak PGI
 haryana main mazaduron kii dihadi 480 rupee he or medical intern ko rose ke 400 milte hai
 No political organization other than those affected by these issues insists, does not threaten that they will show up, then why does it always say the same things that spread hatred that it has not shown
 itani hi phikr he to kal se gramin bank ke ritair logon kii pension 1800 se badhaakar itnaa to kar do jitna jeene ke liye chahie
 Give the joining letter to the youth making arrangements for joining the CBI sub-inspector
 soshal media par bhi bina soch samajhe post par post daali jane lageen, jinamein alpsankhyakon ko nishaanaa banaaya jaataa rahaa
 The local minorities had suffered heavy losses before the police administration understood anything
 bijanour, saharanpur se kaarobaar karne aae musalamaanon kii kai dukaane bhi is gusse kaa shikaar ho chuki thim
 This proves that now people do not have to make a statement to the leader of any political party to create a riot, so much hatred has been instilled in you that after seeing a post on social media, you get blown up and become a rioter Go
 prashasan ko bhi der hui bataane main ki tasviir juthi he jab tak prashasan bataata ki video se kuch pramanit nahin ho rahaa he, tab tak dukaane jal gayi thim
 The objectionable photo posted on social media to incite violence shows a young man and half the body of a woman, not visible in the face and it is shown that the young man is a Muslim and the girl is a Hindu
 kaha jane laga ki yuvak ne ladki kaa balaatkaar kiya he
 On this matter, a fire of hatred spread in that town
 dhara 144 lagu kar di gai, shanivaar ko agastyamuni samet aasapaas ke pramukh kasbon main police kaa flag march kiya gaya
 By the time the DM cleared the picture and said that no one had reported the rape in this town and nothing was authenticated by the pictures in the video
 naukari series ke dauraan baar-baar kaha ki aapke bacchon ko dangai banaaya ja rahaa he
 We talked to the DM of Rudraprayag on this whole incident
 unhone jo bataaya or bheed jis baat ko lekar dangai ho gai donon main bahut antar tha
 The DM did not say which student organization is behind it, but he said that on Thursday evening, some people of the student organization and traders of the trade board brought three workers to the police station in Agastya Muni and said that they have made objectionable pictures of a girl
 And has threatened to put him on social media
 police is maamle kii jaanch kar hi rahi thi ki agle din 6 april ko kai yuva or vyapaar mandal ke log sadakon par utar aae or hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 On Friday evening, the girl came to the police and said that as she was returning home after playing, three workers stopped her and said that her objectionable pictures are with her and they will put her on social media
 ye kahkar wo use dhamkaane lage
 In this case, the police have arrested the three workers
 iske alaava in tasveeron ko galat tareeke se peshkar soshal media par daalane ke aarope main do logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Five people have been arrested so far on charges of arson and sabotage
 abhi vahaan shant he magar jinaki dukaane jali hai zaahir he wo maayoos hi honge, soch rahe honge ki ve kis baat ke liye gusse kaa shikaar hue
 Now you see these shops
 kedarnath hive par in dukaanon ko mazahab ke hisaab se chunaa gaya
 It had photographers, salons, ready-made clothes shops, cosmetic shops, hardware shops, poor vegetable shops
 yahaan hinduon kii bhi dukaane hai
 But by choosing the shops of a community, some belongings were looted, some were set on fire
 aisa karne vaali bheed ne yah bhi nahin sochaa ki pachis-tees saal se yahaan dukaane chal rahi hai
 What is angry about this is also not correct
 kisi kaa dhai lakh kaa nuksaan hua to kisi ko das lakh kaa
 The shop was looted after breaking the locks
 kuch dukandaar dukaan band kar bhaage, taaki jaan bachaa saken
 None of them are ready to talk on camera, because they are afraid
 susheel bahuguna, dinesh mansera or gajendra ji ne saare input die hai
 The fire-extinguishers were the Hindu shopkeepers of the neighborhood after the fire was over
 in sabko agastyamuni ke taane bane ke jal jane par gaharaa dukh he
 i am showing this story to know where hatred is taking us
 to hamane bharat ko yahaan tak pahunchaa diya
 The mob violence was nothing but hatred towards the minority community
 agar balaatkaar ko lekar hi gussa tha to bhi bheed ko koi haq nahin he ki wo kanoon haath main le
 In 2015, there were 34,651 cases of rape across India
 2016 main balaatkaar ke maamle main 12
 Increased by 4 percent
 is saal 38,947 maamle balaatkaar ke maamle darj hue
 Imagine if a mob comes behind every rape, then no city will be saved from burning
 gussa balaatkaar ko lekar tha yaa balaatkaar ke bahaane kisi samudaay ko nishaanaa banane kii ranneeti
 These are all questions, in answering them, you know where the courage is left in the system now
 ab ek aisi kahani bataata hum jahaan balaatkaar kii shikaar apni beti ko insaaf dilaane ke liye ek baap ne hi khud ko aag laga lee
 Those who have burnt shops in Uttarakhand should also come forward for this father, not to burn anyone's shop, to help in the fight for justice
 dangai dharm kii aad main dharm ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 When will you understand this much? system thik hota to kisi ke liye kanoon haath main lenaa aasaan nahin hota
 Neither for the mob nor for the alleged MLA and his brother
 yah bheed ek din aapke gharon kii taraf bhi aegi yaa aapke gharon se kisi ko apni taraf le jaaegi, kisi kaa ghar jalaane, kisi kii hatya karne
 Now you are stuck
 aaj rahul sankrutyaayan kii 125veen jayanti he
 Rahul was a great Hindi litterateur and a big wanderer
 lagbhag tees bhashaaon ke jaankaar the, sahitya, darshan, raajnneeti ityadi vividh vishyon par unhone 100 se adhik kitaaben likhin
 He brought rare manuscripts from Tibet to India
 jayanti ke maukey par aaj unke gaanv kuch patrkaar gaye hai
 Shambhunath Shukla and Prakash k Ray have sent photographs from there
 is vidwaan yaayavar ne bhi dharm kii hinsa par jo kaha tha, aaj bhi aap hota hua dekh rahe hai It is part of an article written by him in 'the Wire'
 tasviren unke paitruk gaanv kanaila kii hai
 Rahul has said that ax has been taken at the root of religions and hence now even talk of religion reconciliation is sometimes heard, but is it possible? Religion does not teach hatred among themselves, what is the point of this white lie? If religion does not teach hatred, then why is our country ruined for this thousand years in the battle of top beard? Leave aside the old history, even today, in the cities and villages of India, who is making the religionists thirsty for the blood of other religious people? Who is fighting cow dung eaters
 kanaila gaanv main unki 125 veen jayanti par chota sa kaarykram hua
 He also has a daughter, Jaya Sankrityayan
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai ki do chaar log abhi bhi kisi ko yaad kar rahe hai, jisane aapako pehle hi yaad dilaa diya tha ki baton ko yaad rakho isse pehle ki dharm ke naam par aapkaa sab kuch jala diya jaae
 On the afternoon of 8 April, a girl set herself on fire in front of the UP Chief Minister's residence
 vah jalakar mar janaa chaahati thi kyonki uskaa kahana he ki uske saath gangrape hua
 The father is tortured and the father dies to withdraw the case
 is ladki ne gangrape kaa aarope bijepi ke vidhayak kuldeep singh senger par lagaaya tha
 There is also an allegation that the mla's brother brutally beat his father on 3 April for not withdrawing the case
 police ne vidhayak par cese darj nahi kiya balki police ne peedita or parivaar par hi cese kar diya or pita ko zakhmi haalat main jail bhej diya
 Due to this anger, the victim and her family came to Lucknow from Unnao and tried to kill themselves by burning them
 is maamle main 6 police adhikari suspend kiye gaye hai
 The accused MLA says that there is a conspiracy to tarnish his image
 ho saktaa he saazish ho magar pita kii maut kya unke bhai ke maarane se maut hui he
 Once you go to the system, it breaks both Hindus or Muslims equally
 uske bheetar kii ninsafiyon se koi bagair hataash hue nahin lautaa he
 Talk to those youths who are waiting for joining SSC CGL 2016 exam
 inamen hindu bhi honge or muslim bhi
 We had passed in August 2017 but it has been eight months in the name of various procedures but there is no joining
 inaki sankhya sau se adhik he or ye sabhi sibiai ke sab inspector ke liye chune gaye the
 Not only this, some people were also elected in 2012 who are contesting the case in court for joining
 ye sibiai ke daftar phone karte hai, kuch kaa kuch jawaab miltaa he magar jwining kii chitthee nahin milti he
 7 months sitting at home without any salary
 unki awaz main kaatarata aa gai he
 Students who passed the SSC examination, who were selected for the film division department, are also worried about their joining
 hamane apni series main inaki baat kai baar uthaai he
 The government itself does not fulfill its promise on time
 sab kuch itnaa fast hone laga he to inaki naukari main itani deree kyon ho rahi he
 Ask them what you want to see on TV, they will say that the job series
 hamen naukari chahie
 An officer who retired from Grameen Bank has also written a letter
 kitni kaatarata bhari he
 You will also be in the same condition when you know that you will now have to live on a monthly pension of Rs 1800
 aakhri selary 1 lakh or ritairement ke agle maheene 1800
 All these are older than me, but they have been so bitter while writing letters, there is so much frustration within them that i do not feel that i am talking to a citizen of India
 hindu muslim dibet aapaki naagarik shakti ko kuchal detaa he
 Either die as a mob or kill someone as a mob
 yahi bahuton kii niyati he
 How sad tippaniyan Any minister of the government can tell who can give justice to them, you can tell them that they have all gone and tweeted here
 aapkaa bharat bahut badal gaya he
 How did you let change 3 april se rohtak post graduate institute of medical sciences, pijiai ke embibies or bidies ke intern dharne par baithe hai
 They are agitating in such a way so that the administration listens to them
 inkaa kahana he ki inhen har maheene 12000 kaa bhatta miltaa he, jabaki baaki kendriya sansthaanon main 17,900 miltaa he
 They should also be given a monthly allowance of Rs 17,900
 saat dinon se 24 ghante ye dharna de rahe hai
 In support of PGI Rohtak, more than 2500 medical interns and students of many government medical colleges of Haryana have gone on strike
 haryana ke sabhi medical college rohtak ke pandit bidi sharma uniwarsity of health and science ke tahat aate hai
 They say that 12,000 patients fall in AIIMS OPD and 10,000 patients in PGI OPD
 sankhya main bahut antar nahin he lekin ames ke intern ko 17,900 rupee masik miltaa he or rohtak pijiai main 12000 hi miltaa he
 The daily wage of laborers in Haryana is Rs 480 and the medical intern gets 400 daily
 in muddon ke liye inase prabhavit logon ke alaava koi raajnneetik sanghathan jid nahin karata, dhamkee nahin detaa ki ye dikhaao tab maanege, hameshaa unheen baton ko lekar kyon kahata he jinase nafrat failati he ki ye dikhya wo nahin dikhaaya he
 It is equally worrying that since yesterday, the pension of the retired people of Grameen Bank should be increased from 1800 to do as much as it should be for living
 sibiai ke sab inspector kii jwining ke liye intazaakar kar rahe naujavaanon ko jwining letters de do
 The administration was also late in stating that the picture was false, shops were burnt until the administration told that nothing was being authenticated by the video
 hinsa bhadakaane ke liye soshal media par jo aapattijanak photo post kiya gaya usamen ek yuvak or yuvati ke aadhe sharir dikh rahe hai, chehre tak nahin dikh rahe or ise aise dikhaaya gaya jaise yuvak musalmaan he or ladki hindu
 It is said that the young man raped the girl
 itani si baat par us kasbe main nafrat kii aag fail gai
 Section 144 was enacted, a flag march of police was carried out on Saturday in nearby major towns including Agastyamuni
 jab tak dm ne tasviir saaf kii or kaha ki is kasbe main balaatkaar kii kisi kii ne report bhi nahin karai he or video kii tasveeron se kuch bhi pramanit nahin hota he
 During the job series, he repeatedly said that your children are being rioted
 is puri ghatana par hamane rudraprayag ke dm se baat kii
 There was a lot of difference between what he told and what the crowd was rioting about
 dm ne nahin bataaya ki koun sa chaatr sanghathan iske peeche he, magar unhone kaha ki guuruuvaar shaam chaatr sanghathan ke kuch log or vyapaar mandal ke vyapaaree teen mazaduron ko agastya muni main thane main lekar aae or kaha ki inhone ek ladki kii aapattijanak tasviir banaai he or use soshal media par daalane kii dhamkee di he
 The police were investigating the matter that the following day, on 6 April, many youth and business people came out on the streets and started a commotion
 shuukravaar shaam ko wo ladki police ke paas ai or usne kaha ki jab wo khelkar ghar laut rahi thi to teen mazaduron ne use roka or kaha ki uski aapattijanak tasviren unke paas hai or wo use soshal media par daal denge
 Saying this, he started threatening her
 is maamle main police ne teenon mazaduron ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Apart from this, two people have been arrested on charges of putting these pictures on social media by presenting them incorrectly
 paanch logon ko aagzani or todphod ke aarope main ab tak giraftaar kiya gaya he
 It is quiet there now, but those whose shops are burnt, it is obvious that they will be disappointed, wondering what they were angry for
 ab aap in dukaanon ko dekhie
 These shops on the Kedarnath highway were chosen according to the religion
 yahaan par photographer, salon, redimaid kapadon kii dukaan thi, cosmetic kii dukaan thi, hardware kii dukaan thi, sabji bechney vaale garib kii bhi dukaan thi
 There are also shops of Hindus here
 magar ek samudaay kii dukaanon ko chunakar kisi kaa saamaan lutaa gaya, kisi main aag laga di gai
 The crowd doing this did not even think that shops have been operating here for twenty-five years
 jis baat par gussa hai wo baat bhi sahi nahin he
 If someone has a loss of two and a half lakhs, then a loss of ten lakhs dukaan ke taale tod kar saamaan nikaalkar lutaa gaya
 Some shopkeepers ran away from the shop to save their lives
 inamen se koi camere par baat karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he, kyonki inhen dar he
 Sushil Bahuguna, Dinesh Mansera and Gajendra ji have given all inputs
 aag lagane vaali bheed ke ja chukne ke baad jo aag buja rahe ve pados ke hindu dukandaar the
 All of them are deeply saddened by the burning of the weft of Agastyamuni
 yah story isliye dikhaa rahaa hum taaki pataa chale ki nafrat hamen kahaan lekar ja rahi he
 So we have brought India to this point
 bheed kii hinsa ke peeche alpsankhyak samudaay ke prati bhari gai nafrat ke alaav kuch nahin tha
 Even if there was anger about rape, the crowd has no right to take that law in their hands
 2015 main bharat bhar main balaatkaar ke 34, 651 maamle dard hue the
 12 in 2016 rape case
 4 pratishat kii vruddhi ho gai
 This year, 38,947 cases of rape were reported
 sochie agar har balaatkaar ke peeche bheed aa jaae to koi shahar jalane se nahin bachegaa
 Anger was about rape or a strategy to target a community on the pretext of rape
 yah sab sawaal he, jinka jawaab dene main aap jaanate hai ki ab kahaan system main himmat bachi he
 Now let me tell a story where a father set himself on fire in order to bring justice to his daughter, a victim of rape
 uttarakhand main jin logon ne dukaane jalaayin hai, unhen is baap ke liye bhi aage aana chahie, kisi kii dukaan jalaane ke liye nahin, insaaf kii ladaai main madad ke liye
 Rioters are defaming religion under the guise of religion
 itani baat aap kab samajhenge
 Had the system been right, it would not have been easy for anyone to take the law into their hands
 na bheed ke liye na kathith rup se vidhayak or unke bhai ke liye
 One day this mob will also come towards your houses or will take someone from your houses, burning someone's house, killing someone
 ab aap funs gaye hai

 8 april kii dopaher upi ke mukhyamantri ke awaas ke saamne ek ladki ne khud ko aag laga lee
 She wanted to die because she says she was gangraped
 maamle ke waapas lene ke liye pita ko pratadit kiya gaya or pita kii maut ho gai
 The girl accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar of gangrape
 ek aarope yah bhi he ki mukadmaa waapas na lene par vidhayak ke bhai ne 3 april ko uske pita ko berahami se peeta
 The police did not register a case against the MLA, but the police filed a case against the victim and the family itself and sent the father to jail in a wounded condition
 is rosh ke kaaran peedita or uske parivaar ke log unnav se lakhanu aae or khud ko jalaakar maarane kii koshish kii
 Six police officers have been suspended in this case
 aaropee vidhayak kaa kahana he ki unki chhavi karaab karne kii saazish ho rahi he
 There may be intrigue, but the father's death is the death of his brother
 ek baar aap system ke paas jaaiye, wo hindu ho yaa muslim donon ko baraabar se tod detaa he
 No one has returned from his inner injustice without being discouraged
 aap un yuvaaon se baat kiijie jo esayssi kii sijiel 2016 kii pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Among them will be Hindus and also Muslims
 agast 2017 main hi paas kar gaye the magar tarah-tarah kii prakriyaaon ke naam se aath maheene ho gaye magar xining nahin ho rahi he
 Their number is more than a hundred and all these were elected to the Sub Inspector of CBI
 yahi nahin 2012 main bhi kuch log chune gaye the jo court main cese lard rahe hai jwining ke liye
 They call the CBI office, some get some answers but the joining letter is not available
 7 maheene bagaiyr kisi vetan ke ghar baithe hai
 His voice has become cuteness
 esayssi kii pariksha se paas hue chaatr jo film division vibhaag ke liye chune gaye the ve bhi apni jwining ko lekar pareshaan hai
 We have raised his point many times in our series
 sarkaar hi samay par apana vaada puraa nahin karti he
 Everything is starting to get so fast, so why is there such a delay in their jobs
 aap inase puuchhie ki tivi par kya dekhnaa chaahate ho yahi kahenge ki naukari series
 We need a job gramin bank se ritair hue ek adhikari ne bhi patr likhaa he
 How ripe
 aapaki bhi vahi haalat ho jaaegi jab pataa chalegaa ki aapako ab 1800 rupee ke masik pension par rahanaa hoga
 Last salary 1 lakh and 1800 next month of retirement

 Hindu Muslim debate crushes your civil power

 This is the destiny of many
 kitna dukhad he
 The comments sarkaar kaa koi mantri bataa sakate hai jo inhen insaaf dilaa saktaa he, aap hi bataa dijie vaise ye sabake yahaan jaakar twit kar chuke hai
 Your India has changed a lot
 aapane badalane kaise diya
 Since April 3, the Rohtak Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, MBI of PGI and interns of BDS have been sitting on dharna
 ye tarah tarah se andolan kar rahe hai taaki prashasan inaki baat sun le
 They say that they get an allowance of 12000 per month, while the rest of the central institutions get 17,900
 unhen bhi 17,900 rupee masik bhatta diya jaae
 They are protesting for 24 hours for seven days
 pijiai rohtak ke samarthan main haryana ke kai sarkari medical college ke 2500 se adhik medical intern or chaatr hadtaal par chale gaye hai
 All medical colleges of Haryana are under the Pandit BD Sharma University of Health and Science of Rohtak
 inkaa kahana he ki ames ke opidi main 12,000 mariz aate hai or pijiai kii opidi main 10,000 mariz aate hai
 There is not much difference in the number but AIIMS interns get Rs 17,900 monthly and only 12000 in Rohtak PGI
 haryana main mazaduron kii dihadi 480 rupee he or medical intern ko rose ke 400 milte hai
 No political organization other than those affected by these issues insists, does not threaten that they will show up, then why does it always say the same things that spread hatred that it has not shown
 itani hi phikr he to kal se gramin bank ke ritair logon kii pension 1800 se badhaakar itnaa to kar do jitna jeene ke liye chahie
 Give the joining letter to the youth making arrangements for joining the CBI sub-inspector
 naukari series ke dauraan baar-baar kaha ki aapke bacchon ko dangai banaaya ja rahaa he
 We talked to the DM of Rudraprayag on this whole incident
 unhone jo bataaya or bheed jis baat ko lekar dangai ho gai donon main bahut antar tha
 The DM did not say which student organization is behind it, but he said that on Thursday evening, some people of the student organization and traders of the trade board brought three workers to the police station in Agastya Muni and said that they have made objectionable pictures of a girl
 And has threatened to put him on social media
 police is maamle kii jaanch kar hi rahi thi ki agle din 6 april ko kai yuva or vyapaar mandal ke log sadakon par utar aae or hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 On Friday evening, the girl came to the police and said that as she was returning home after playing, three workers stopped her and said that her objectionable pictures are with her and they will put her on social media
 ye kahkar wo use dhamkaane lage
 In this case, the police have arrested the three workers
 iske alaava in tasveeron ko galat tareeke se peshkar soshal media par daalane ke aarope main do logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Five people have been arrested so far on charges of arson and sabotage
 abhi vahaan shant he magar jinaki dukaane jali hai zaahir he wo maayoos hi honge, soch rahe honge ki ve kis baat ke liye gusse kaa shikaar hue
 Now you see these shops
 kedarnath hive par in dukaanon ko mazahab ke hisaab se chunaa gaya
 It had photographers, salons, ready-made clothes shops, cosmetic shops, hardware shops, poor vegetable shops
 yahaan hinduon kii bhi dukaane hai
 But by choosing the shops of a community, some belongings were looted, some were set on fire
 aisa karne vaali bheed ne yah bhi nahin sochaa ki pachis-tees saal se yahaan dukaane chal rahi hai
 What is angry about this is also not correct
 kisi kaa dhai lakh kaa nuksaan hua to kisi ko das lakh kaa
 The shop was looted after breaking the locks
 kuch dukandaar dukaan band kar bhaage, taaki jaan bachaa saken
 None of them are ready to talk on camera, because they are afraid
 susheel bahuguna, dinesh mansera or gajendra ji ne saare input die hai
 The fire-extinguishers were the Hindu shopkeepers of the neighborhood after the fire was over
 in sabko agastyamuni ke taane bane ke jal jane par gaharaa dukh he
 i am showing this story to know where hatred is taking us
 to hamane bharat ko yahaan tak pahunchaa diya
 The mob violence was nothing but hatred towards the minority community
 agar balaatkaar ko lekar hi gussa tha to bhi bheed ko koi haq nahin he ki wo kanoon haath main le
 In 2015, there were 34,651 cases of rape across India
 2016 main balaatkaar ke maamle main 12
 Increased by 4 percent
 is saal 38,947 maamle balaatkaar ke maamle darj hue
 Imagine if a mob comes behind every rape, then no city will be saved from burning
 gussa balaatkaar ko lekar tha yaa balaatkaar ke bahaane kisi samudaay ko nishaanaa banane kii ranneeti
 These are all questions, in answering them, you know where the courage is left in the system now
 ab ek aisi kahani bataata hum jahaan balaatkaar kii shikaar apni beti ko insaaf dilaane ke liye ek baap ne hi khud ko aag laga lee
 Those who have burnt shops in Uttarakhand should also come forward for this father, not to burn anyone's shop, to help in the fight for justice
 dangai dharm kii aad main dharm ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 When will you understand this much? system thik hota to kisi ke liye kanoon haath main lenaa aasaan nahin hota
 Neither for the mob nor for the alleged MLA and his brother
 yah bheed ek din aapke gharon kii taraf bhi aegi yaa aapke gharon se kisi ko apni taraf le jaaegi, kisi kaa ghar jalaane, kisi kii hatya karne
 Now you are stuck
 aaj rahul sankrutyaayan kii 125veen jayanti he
 Rahul was a great Hindi litterateur and a big wanderer
 lagbhag tees bhashaaon ke jaankaar the, sahitya, darshan, raajnneeti ityadi vividh vishyon par unhone 100 se adhik kitaaben likhin
 He brought rare manuscripts from Tibet to India

 tasviren unke paitruk gaanv kanaila kii hai
 Rahul has said that ax has been taken at the root of religions and hence now even talk of religion reconciliation is sometimes heard, but is it possible? Religion does not teach hatred among themselves, what is the point of this white Zhu ? If religion does not teach hatred, then why is our country ruined for this thousand years in the battle of top beard? Leave aside the old history, even today, in the cities and villages of India, who is making the religionists thirsty for the blood of other religious people? Who is fighting cow dung eaters
 kanaila gaanv main unki 125 veen jayanti par chota sa kaarykram hua
 He also has a daughter, Jaya Sankrityayan
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai ki do chaar log abhi bhi kisi ko yaad kar rahe hai, jisane aapako pehle hi yaad dilaa diya tha ki baton ko yaad rakho isse pehle ki dharm ke naam par aapkaa sab kuch jala diya jaae
 On the afternoon of 8 April, a girl set herself on fire in front of the UP Chief Minister's residence
 vah jalakar mar janaa chaahati thi kyonki uskaa kahana he ki uske saath gangrape hua
 The father is tortured and the father dies to withdraw the case
 is ladki ne gangrape kaa aarope bijepi ke vidhayak kuldeep singh senger par lagaaya tha
 There is also an allegation that the mla's brother brutally beat his father on 3 April for not withdrawing the case
 police ne vidhayak par cese darj nahi kiya balki police ne peedita or parivaar par hi cese kar diya or pita ko zakhmi haalat main jail bhej diya
 Due to this anger, the victim and her family came to Lucknow from Unnao and tried to kill themselves by burning them
 is maamle main 6 police adhikari suspend kiye gaye hai
 The accused MLA says that there is a conspiracy to tarnish his image
 ho saktaa he saazish ho magar pita kii maut kya unke bhai ke maarane se maut hui he
 Once you go to the system, it breaks both Hindus or Muslims equally
 uske bheetar kii ninsafiyon se koi bagair hataash hue nahin lautaa he
 Talk to those youths who are waiting for joining SSC CGL 2016 exam
 inamen hindu bhi honge or muslim bhi
 We had passed in August 2017 but it has been eight months in the name of various procedures but there is no joining

 unki awaz main kaatarata aa gai he
 Students who passed the SSC examination, who were selected for the film division department, are also worried about their joining
 hamane apni series main inaki baat kai baar uthaai he
 The government itself does not fulfill its promise on time
 sab kuch itnaa fast hone laga he to inaki naukari main itani deree kyon ho rahi he
 Ask them what you want to see on TV, they will say that the job series
 hamen naukari chahie
 An officer who retired from Grameen Bank has also written a letter
 kitni kaatarata bhari he
 You will also be in the same condition when you know that you will now have to live on a monthly pension of Rs 1800
 aakhri selary 1 lakh or ritairement ke agle maheene 1800
 All these are older than me, but they have been so bitter while writing letters, there is so much frustration within them that i do not feel that i am talking to a citizen of India
 hindu muslim dibet aapaki naagarik shakti ko kuchal detaa he
 Either die as a mob or kill someone as a mob
 yahi bahuton kii niyati he
 How sad tippaniyan Any minister of the government can tell who can give justice to them, you can tell them that they have all gone and tweeted here
 aapkaa bharat bahut badal gaya he
 How did you let change 3 april se rohtak post graduate institute of medical sciences, pijiai ke embibies or bidies ke intern dharne par baithe hai
 They are agitating in such a way so that the administration listens to them
 inkaa kahana he ki inhen har maheene 12000 kaa bhatta miltaa he, jabaki baaki kendriya sansthaanon main 17,900 miltaa he
 They should also be given a monthly allowance of Rs 17,900
 saat dinon se 24 ghante ye dharna de rahe hai
 In support of PGI Rohtak, more than 2500 medical interns and students of many government medical colleges of Haryana have gone on strike

 sankhya main bahut antar nahin he lekin ames ke intern ko 17,900 rupee masik miltaa he or rohtak pijiai main 12000 hi miltaa he
 The daily wage of laborers in Haryana is Rs 480 and the medical intern gets 400 daily
 in muddon ke liye inase prabhavit logon ke alaava koi raajnneetik sanghathan jid nahin karata, dhamkee nahin detaa ki ye dikhaao tab maanege, hameshaa unheen baton ko lekar kyon kahata he jinase nafrat failati he ki ye dikhya wo nahin dikhaaya he
 It is equally worrying that since yesterday, the pension of the retired people of Grameen Bank should be increased from 1800 to do as much as it should be for living
 sibiai ke sab inspector kii jwining ke liye intazaakar kar rahe naujavaanon ko jwining letters de do

 At present, the issue of farmers is at the peak all over the country
 netaaon se lekar raajnneetik partiyaan tak har koi kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The farmer is also taking various measures to increase his yield
 lekin uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr se ek aisa udhaaharan saamne aayaa he jo aapako chaunkaa bhi saktaa he or thodaa saavdhaan bhi kar saktaa he
 Some farmers in Bulandshahr are using liquor rather than any medicine to increase potato yield
 yahaan kisaan apane kheton main sharaab chhidak rahe hai
 According to news agency ANI, farmers in Bulandshahr are sprinkling alcohol to increase their potato yield
 in kisaanon kii tasviren soshal media par jabardast tareeke se viral ho rahi hai
 However, the local plant production officer says that spraying alcohol in any crop can thus be fatal
 unhone ye bhi bataaya ki is prakaar kaa koi shodh bhi nahin he jo ki ye siddh karata ho ki sharaab kaa chhidkaav karne se fasal ko phayda hota he
 He also appealed to local farmers to stop using this type of experiment with immediate effect

 Plant Production Officer says, "there's no scientific reason behind use of alcohol as medicine for plants
 i appeal to farmers to use right medicines

 com / bv6v4tbmzh — ANI UP (@aninewsup) December 23, 2018 It does not benefit in any way
 gauratlab he ki kai tareekon kii pareshaani se jujh rahaa kisaan chahta he ki uski fasal kii paidaavaar adhik ho, taaki vah adhik maatra main munafa kama sake
 But this type of big mistakes happen in this affair
 saaf he ki agar kisaan aalu kii paidaavaar badhaane ke liye is prakaar sharaab kaa chhidkaav kar rahe hai to logon ke liye ye jaanaleva bhi ho saktaa he
 The reasoning of the farmers behind this experiment is that they sprinkle very small amounts of alcohol, due to which their potato yield is bumper
 itnaa hi nahin balki aalu kaa sies bhi kaaphi bada hota he
 Some farmers also say that they have been using this technique for a long time

 Like many other fans, Shah Rukh celebrated the World Cup victory on Sunday night by climbing on the roof of his car, shouting and waving the tricolor
 unhone kaha, ‘main bahut khush hum

 Although Lord Shiva has many names, but his devotees like to call him Bholenath
 bholenath aise dev jinhen prasann karnaa bahut hi aasaan he
 This word has a philosophical meaning - Bhole means childlike innocence, Nath means Lord, Lord Bhagwan Shiva is called Bholenath on one side and on the other side he is also called the destroyer of creation
 jo shmashaan main basate hai or jinke sharir par bhasma lipati rahati he, jinke saath bhoot-pret rahete hai, aise dev ko bholenath kyon kaha jaataa he? lekin in sabake baavjood shiv bhole hi hai
 There is no ego nor cunning in them
 unhen apni shakti par bilkul bhi abhimaan nahin he isiilie vah bholenath hai
 On Shivaratri 13 or 14, know the exact date and the time of Muhurta, there is a story behind him being called Bholenath
 ek asur tha jo hajaaron varshon se tapasya kar rahaa tha
 Engaged day and night in the worship of Lord Shiva
 bhagwaan shiv bhaleebhanti jaanate the ki vah ek rakshas he or use vardaan dena acha nahin hoga
 Still he appeared and asked Asura to ask for a boon
 us asur kaa naam bhasmasur tha
 Bhasmasura sought a boon from Lord Shiva that whatever he touched, be consumed immediately
 shiv ne turant use yah vardaan de diya
 Now Bhasmasura wanted to test the boon
 bhasmasur ko laga ki agar vah bhagwaan shiv ko hi bhasma kar de to phir usase zyada shreshth koi nahin rah jayega
 Do not forget these 12 things even on Shivratri! It is said that Lord Shiva does not return empty handed to his devotee, so the naïve started running away after saving his life
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne ek chaal chali or mohini kaa bhesh dhaaran kiya
 Lord Vishnu in the form of Mohini danced to fascinate the demon and cleverly placed Bhasmasura's hand on his head
 is tarah se bhasmasur naam ke rakshas se mukti mili
 That is why Lord Shiva is called Bholenath from whom it is easiest to get a boon
 shivaratri par jarur japen bholenath ke 1008 naam, puri hogi har muradabhagwan shiv un logon par prasann ho jate hai jo apana kaam mehnat se karte hai
 It does not require special efforts to convince them
 unke bhakt jo bhi vardaan maangate hai, vah dete hai
 Whether it is a human being or a demon, he fulfills everyone's wishes
 tarakasur naam ke rakshas ne kathor tapasya kii thi
 Lord Shiva was pleased with that too and asked for a boon
 tab tarakasur ne shiv se vardaan maanga ki bhagwaan shiv ke putr ke alaava koi use maar nahin sakegaa

 bijli board kii leadership main pherbadal:rajya main bijli power sector kii samasyaon se nipatane ke liye sabase pehle siem modi ne upyukt beurocret kii talash kar use kaman saunpi
 Modi brought the Gujarat cadre back to Manjula Subramaniam, who was then in the Prime Minister's Office and played an important role in liberalization in the country, and handed over the command of GSEB
 2
 Home repairing exercise: After getting the autonomy to work with CM Modi, Manjula first researched the entire electricity scenario in the state
 iske baad manjula ne electricity board kii vittiya haalat ko sudhaarney or bijli vibhaag ke karmchaariyon ke hausale ko buland karne kii koshish kii
 3
 byaaj dar main kami or nijee companiyon se qaraar kii samiksha:modi ke netritv main manjula ne sabase pehle un bainkon ko saadhaa jo jiesibi ko mahangaa lone de rahe the
 GSEB was burdened with an interest of 18 per cent on loans
 un sabhi bainko ko byajdar kam karne ke liye taiyaar kar liya gaya or iske chalate 2002-03 main jiesibi ne 500 karod rupye se adhik kii bachat kii
 4
 phir vivaadon se hua saamana:modi or manjula kii koshishon ke baad majboot ho chukeelectricity bordne phir sabase vivaadaaspad pahalu se saamana kiya
 Till date no government had reviewed the agreements to buy power from private producers
 lekin modi kii aguwai main gujarat board ne paaya kii companiyon ne janarator effishiency ko badha-chadha kar aanka tha or sarkaar se zyada paisa vasuul rahe the
 Initially, there was a lot of difficulty in reducing the price from private companies, but after 18 months of negotiations, the Gujarat Board not only reduced the price but also Rs 685 crore in the financial year 2002-03 and 1000 crore in 2003-04
 Saved rupees as well
 5
 Stricter law brought against electricity theft: According to GSEB, in 2001, 20 percent of the electricity was used in urban areas of Gujarat and 80 percent in rural areas with the help of theft
 is chori ko rokane ke liye kade kanoon banaae gaye or pradesh main paanch vishesh police stesan chinhit kiye gaye jinka kaam sirf is chori par lagamaa lagaana tha
 6
 rajya main 24 ghante bijli supplai main gemeanger bana ye kadam:rajya main modi sarkaar banane se pehle electricity board ke paas bijli chori ko rokane kaa koi kargar tarika nahin tha
 Hence Manjula started the construction of double feeder lines on a war footing across the state to curb power theft
 iske baad sarkaar ne sabase mahatvapurn kadam uthaate hue gramin ilaake ko bijli supplai karne vaali feader line ko do bhaagon main baant diya
 Previously, the same feeder line used to supply electricity to rural areas and houses, and due to this, the incidence of theft increased manifold
 im ahmedabad ke mutabik is project se rajya kii modi sarkaar ne 23,000 karod rupye ke capital ekspandichar kii bachat bhi kar lee
 7
 electricity board ko 7 companiyon main tod diya gaya:may 2003 main modi sarkaar ne gujarat electricity industry act paarit kiya

 The Gujarat board declared a profit of Rs 203 crore for the first time
 yah munafa 2010-11 tak badhkar 533 karod rupye par pahunch gaya
 Losses in transmission and distribution were capped at 20 per cent
 vahiin sarkaar kii koshishon ke chalate pradesh main bijli bill kaa bhugtan lagbhag 100 fisadi ho gaya
 9
 powerplan kaa nateeja:ab alam ye he ki nijee companiyaan nae projects lagane ke liye qatari main khadi hai
 At present, the total power generation in the state is more than 16 thousand MW
 isamen nijee companiyaan 8,000megawatt bijlide rahi hai or lagbhag 2200 megawatt atirikt bijli kaa utpaadan ho rahaa he jise duusare rajyon ko market rate par bechaa ja rahaa he
 24-hour power supply in UP! This is the most powerful model of Gujarat bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke netaa yashavanth sinha ne chini ghuspaith ke masale par sidhe pradhanmantri manmohan singh par hamalaa kiya he
 Standing the government in the dock, he even called the Prime Minister down to nothing
 bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha ne kaha, 'china jaanata he ki bhartiya sarkaar kamjor he or vah iskaa phayda uthaa rahaa he
 In fact, BJP leaders were making statements on the news of incursions by Chinese troops into India's border
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab yashavanth sinha ne pradhanmantri par tikhaa hamalaa kiya he

 narendra modi kii ore se pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko nishaanaa banaae jane ko khaarij karte hue congress ne aaj kaha ki desh main dhai darjan mukhyamantri he
 The ruling party dismissed Singh's challenge to Modi for public debate as 'brambola'
 donon dalon main vakyuddh nichle str par pahunch gaya he jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne is silsile main ‘saas, bahu or damaad’ dharawahik kaa zikr kiya, jo apratyaksh rup se sonia gandhi, unke damaad rabart wadra se sambandhit tha
 At the same time, the Congress asked whether he was a villain
 kendriya mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha, or kya ve khalanaayak hai? ek film kaa naam bhi khalanaayak rahaa he
 The villain serial is also going on
 iske bare main unase puuchhen
 Khurshid said this after hoisting the tricolor of party president Sonia Gandhi at the Congress headquarters
 unase modi kii tippanee ke bare main poocha gaya tha
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat has said in Bhuj that nepotism used to be at the root of corruption in serials of olden days
 samay ke saath isamen badlaav aayaa he
 a new serial uncle, nephew, came into corruption and now it has moved towards mother-in-law, daughter-in-law and son-in-law
 khurshid ne modi ko apni peeth khud thapthapaane se bachane kii salaah di
 Union Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad rejected the comparison between Modi and the Prime Minister and said, "if i say today that i am bigger than Obama, then people will call me crazy
" aaazaad ne is sambandh main hindi ke muhaavarey kaa upyog kiya, ek mukhyamantri kis tarah se pradhanmantri ko chunauti de saktaa he
 Is Raja Bhoja and Gangu
 
 Can be any comparison
 unhone kaha, koi bhi kisi ko chunauti dene se roak saktaa he bhala
 Every person sitting in his house is a lion
 baharhaal, khurshid ne ‘yas ve can’ tippanee ke liye gujarat ke mukhyamantri par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki yah obama ke bhaashan se aayaat kiya gaya he, jo unke liye kisi ne taiyaar kiya he
 He said that someone gives them something (to Modi) in writing and they read it
 ab hamen dekhnaa hoga ki pakistan, europe, america or bharat ke bare main vah kiskaa likhaa padhate hai
 Asked about Modi's criticism of foreign policy, he said that the United States has refused to grant visas to the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 unhone kaha ki vah (modi) itnaa acha kar rahe hai ki unhen videsh jane ke liye bhi vija nahin mil rahaa he
 Taking a dig at Modi's remarks about dealing with Pakistan, Khurshid said that the Chief Minister of Gujarat should think what will be its impact
 khurshid ne kaha, main unase poochna chahta hum ki kya ve apane hiton ke liye desh ke hiton ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 He said that the Prime Minister of India, whatever it may be or from any party, is a symbol of India's commitment and aspirations
 tippaniyan He said, i am sad that there is someone who does not understand the basics of Indian political ethics
 agar vah (modi) apni peeth thapthapaanaa chaahate hai, vah aisa kar sakate hai
 But Modi should have kept restraint at least today
 khurshid ne kaha, aaj aitihaasik din he, jo hamen swatantraaa sangharsh se jodta he
 If Modi does not understand this and does not know this, then i feel pity on him
 
 
 unhone kaha ki vah desh ko kis tarah kaa netritv pradaan karenge yah hamaare liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 The war of words between the two parties has reached a low point when the Gujarat Chief Minister referred to the serial 'saas, Bahu and Son-in-law' in this connection, which was indirectly related to Sonia Gandhi, her son-in-law Robert Vadra
 vahiin, congress ne kaha ki kya vah khalanaayak hai
 Union Minister Salman Khurshid said, and are they villains? The name of a film has also been villain
 khalanaayak dharawahik bhi chal rahaa he
 Ask them about this
 khurshid ne yah baat congress mukhyalay par party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke tirangaa fahraane ke baad kahi
 He was asked about Modi's remarks
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne bhuj main kaha he ki, bhai bhatijawad puraane dinon ke dharawahikon main bhrashtachar ke mul main hua karata tha
 It has changed over time
 bhrashtachar main ek nayaa dharawahik mamaa, bhaanja aayaa or ab yah saas, bahu or damaad kii ore bad gaya he
 Khurshid advised Modi to avoid patting himself on his back
 kendriya mantri gulam nabi aaazaad ne modi or pradhanmantri ke bich tulana ko khaarij karte hue kaha, agar aaj main kahuun ki main obama se bada hum, tab log mujhe pagal kahenge
 Azad used the Hindi idiom in this regard, how can a Chief Minister challenge the Prime Minister
 kya raja bhoj or gangu
 
 main koi tulana ho sakati he
 He said, no one can stop anyone from challenging them
 apane ghar main baitha har vyakti sher he
 However, Khurshid hit out at the Chief Minister of Gujarat for his 'yes We Can' comment, saying it was imported from Obama's speech, which someone has prepared for him
 unhone kaha ki koi unhen (modi ko) kuch likhakar detaa he or ve use pard dete hai
 Now we have to see whose writings he read about Pakistan, Europe, America and India
 modi kii ore se videsh niti kii aalochana kiye jane ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha yaad dilaayaa ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ko america ne vija dene se manaa kar diya he
 He said that he (modi) is doing so well that he is not getting a visa to go abroad
 pakistan se nipatane ke bare main modi kii tippanee par nishaanaa sadhate khurshid ne kaha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ko sochna chahie ki iskaa kya prabhaav padegaa
 Khurshid said, i want to ask them if they can harm the interests of the country for their own interests
 unhone kaha, bharat kaa pradhanmantri, chaahe vah koi bhi ho yaa kisi bhi party kaa ho, vah bharat kii patibaddhta or aakankshaon kaa pratik hota he
 The comments unhone kaha, mujhe dukh he ki koi aisa he jise bhartiya raajnneetik aachaar kii buniyadi baton kii samaj nahin he
 If he (modi) wants to pat his back, he can do that
 lekin modi ko kam se kam aaj sanyam rakhana chahie tha
 Khurshid said, today is a historic day, which connects us to the freedom struggle
 agar modi ise nahin samajhate hai or unhen isaki jaankaree nahin he to mujhe un par dayaa aati he
 
 
 He said that what kind of leadership he will provide to the country is a matter of concern for us
 kendriya mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha, or kya ve khalanaayak hai? ek film kaa naam bhi khalanaayak rahaa he
 The villain serial is also going on
 iske bare main unase puuchhen
