 This is the time of the year when ideas are being flashed in the atmosphere, challenging the logic of the definite and the intellectuals are preparing the blueprint for a better future
 12 wein india today conklev main aap sabhi kaa swaagat he
 There have been many major changes in the country in the last 11 years
 lekin mujhe yakeen he ki aap bhi maanate honge ki bharat sirf ek desh hi nahin he
 Rather it is the largest democracy in the world where rapid changes are taking place
 ek raashtra ke rup main hamane sabko achraj main daal rakhaa he, jahaan loktantr kaa sabase acha or sabase kharaab pravriti ek saath maujuud he
 For the people of the news world like us, every moment was thrilling
 lekin desh ke liye ye vakt kaisaa rahaa, yah kahana thodaa mushkil he
 India Today Conclave, which has been organized continuously for the last 11 years, has been considering the development of Loktantra in the 21st century and the important issues that change with time
 is saal bhi conkalev main loktantr ke badalte ayaamon par prakhyat vaktaaon ke saath charchaa jari rahegi
 This year's theme is: Reinventing Democracy
 loktantr ke liye or loktantr ke andar ke sangharsh ke yug main isse behatar topic or kuch nahin ho saktaa tha
 The painful fight for democracy in the Middle East in the 21st century and the fight for democracy in Arabia warned that the desire for democratic freedom is highly contagious
 loktantr kaa yah sangharsh abhi khatm nahin hua he or romance ke mausam vasant main bhi loktantr main abhi puri aazaadee nahin he
 Blood is still being shed in Libya and Syria and the whole world is watching
 misr main taanaashaahee ke baad bhi loktantr main jivan behatar nahin he
 It is a fact that maintaining the democratic system is more difficult than fighting for democracy
 jahaan duniya main ek ore loktantr ke liye sangharsh jari he, vahiin duniya ke bade loktantr sankat ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 Governments in Europe strive to save the single currency from collapse and revive their economies

 Angry at the immoral and rude behavior of governments, Jan Adalat has come down the road
 kamjor raajnneetik netritv se arthvyavastha danvadol ho rahi he
 The growth rate in the country has reached the lowest level of the last 10 years
 aaj do bade arthshaastri is mudde par apni raay rakhenge
 This attempt to debate the changing perspective of Lokantrant in this conclave lasting two days is unique in itself
 puri duniya main bharat kii chhavi ko saatven aasmaan par pahunchane kaa damakham rakhane vaale purv raashtrapati or missile main doctor abdul kalam loktantr or raksha zaruraton par is conklev main bebaak raay rakhenge
 The presence of Army Chief General Bikram Singh to discuss the role of the army in nation building and his opinion will also be special in this conclave
 inke alaava bharat main badhate bazaar par charchaa ke liye prafull patel, jon fredrick baksaas or kris gopi krishnan kii maujuudagi kuch khaas hi hogi
 The presence of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi to discuss how effective the Namo Nam Mantra is going to be to discuss the changing political environment of India and his views will definitely decide the direction of politics
 ant main, loktantr utana hi acha he jitna ve log jinhen ise sanbhaalane liye janadesh mila he
 This is the reason that along with the crisis in democracy, the leadership crisis is also visible
 iske baavjood loktantr aapako or mujhe jo sabase behatar cheez detii he vah he ummid
 Democracy is like a plant which needs constant care
 conklev bhi usee prakriya kaa hissaa he or jab itani hastiyaan ek saath ek manch par hongi to yakeenan 21veen sadi ke bharat ke sapane saakaar bhi honge
 Ladies and Gentlemen, Democracy means "rule of the people"
 sirf isamen ham kuch nayaapan laa sakate he
 Hopefully, this conclave lasting two days with new thinking and new direction will be liked

 Congress' 15-year exile in Chhattisgarh is over
 congress ne prachand bahumat ke saath rajya main jeet hasil kii he or raman singh kaa lagaataar chauthi baar mukhyamantri banane kaa sapana tut gaya he
 Janata Congress Chhattisgarh chief and former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi won by 46462 votes from the Marwahi seat of the state
 ajit jogi ko kul 74041 vot mili hai
 At the same time, Archana of BJP has got 27579 votes
 marvaahee seat jogi parivaar kii paramparaagat maani jaati he
 This seat has been very popular since the time of Madhya Pradesh, Ajit Jogi had the distinction of becoming the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh by winning from here
 bilaspur jile main aane vaala marvaahee vidhansabha kshetra madhyapradesh kii seemaa se laga hua he
 Reserved for tribal community
 is vidhansabha kshetra kii ek or khaasiyat he ki ye dalbadalu netaaon ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 The specialty area of marwahi is surrounded by dense forests
 kareeb dedh lakh hectyer main jangal failaa hua he
 This area is also famous for bears
 is ilaake main durlabh safed bhaaluu bhi milte hai, lekin ab yahi bhaaluu yahaan kii sabase badi samasya ban chuke hai
 Bear is the biggest problem of the villagers living in the forest, there are frequent reports of bear attacks
 jogi mukhyamantri rahete hue is samasya se nipatane ke liye oparation jamavant chalaane kii ghoshnaa kii thi, lekin jogi ke jate hi ye yojana bhi gum ho gai
 This is the reason why bears along with other issues are also a big issue in every election
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavamarvahee seat par 2013 main 11 ummidavaar maidan main the
 Amit Jogi from the Congress managed not only to save his father's legacy but also to win by record votes
 amit jogi ko 82 hajaar 909 vot mili the
 While BJP candidate Sameera Packra received 36 thousand 659 votes
 baaki ummidavaar apni jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa sake the
 Ajit Jogi of the Congress got 67523 votes in the 2008 assembly election

 bijepi ke nand kumaar sai ko 22119 ko vot mili the
 The story of Marwahi defected mlas dominated seat is interesting
 ye dalbadalu vidhayakon kaa kshetra rahaa he
 It starts with Bhanwar Singh Porte, the big tribal leader who won the 1972, 1977 and 1980 elections and hit a hat-trick
 1985 main party ne unka tikat kaat diya or congress ke dinadayal vidhayak bane
 Angered Bhanwar Singh left the Congress and joined the BJP and became an MLA in 1990
 1993 main phir bijepi ne unka tikat kaat diya or congress ke pahalwaan singh maravi is seat se vidhayak bane
 In this way, after 2001, this assembly remained as a Jogi
 2003, 2008 main ajit jogi lagaataar yahaan se vidhayak rahe
 In 2013, Amit Jogi left this seat
 ab 2018 main amit pita ke liye seat chhod rahe he
 Political history shows that even though BJP MLA has been elected twice from here, it is a Congressman
 haalanki amit jogi maanate hai ki ye congress kaa nahin balki jogi kaa garh he
 The agony of Marwahi, 150 km from Bilaspur, is that the tribal development here is so far away from its district headquarters, where it does not dare to reach
 lihaaja naa to unhen sarkari yojanaon kii jaankaree milti he or na hi unka sahi tarah se kriyanvayan hota he
 As a result, this backward area is falling further backward

 Two Eids are celebrated under the religion of Islam
 hindustan ke saath duniya ke tamaam deshon main musalmaan id manaate hai
 Eid-ul Fitr is celebrated after Ramadan and 70 days later comes the occasion of Eid-ul Juha, also known as Bakrid
 bakreed ke maukey par muslim samudaay ke log namaaj adaa karte hai
 Also animals are sacrificed
 paigambar ibrahim ke jamaane main hui shuruatislamic manyata ke mutabik, duniya main 1 lakh 24 hajaar paigambar (massenger) aae
 One of these was Prophet Hazrat Ibrahim
 inhen ke jamaane main bakreed kii shuruuaat hui
 This is the whole story
 Islamic knowledge tells that once Allah ordered Hazrat Ibrahim to sacrifice his most beloved thing in the dream
 hazrat ibrahim ko 80 saal kii umr main aulad naseeb huri thi
 In such a situation, his son Hazrat Ismail was the most beloved
 allaah kaa hukum puraa karnaa unke liye ek kadaa imtihaan tha
 On one side was the command of Allah and on the other side was the love of the son
 aise main unhone allaah ke hukum par amal kiya or bete ko allaah kii raja ke liye qurbaan karne ko raji ho gaye
 Islamist Maulana Hameed Nomani explains that Hazrat Ibrahim felt that his love should not come in the way of giving a son's sacrifice
 isliye unhone apni ankhon par pattee baandh lee
 Subsequently, when Hazrat Ibrahim fired a knife to cut the neck of son Ismail, a Dumba (an animal) was introduced in place of Ismail Alaihissalam by Allah's command
 ibrahim alaihissalam ne jab aankh se pattee hataai to unhone apane bete ko apane saamne jinda khadaa paaya
 Allah liked this idea of hazrat Ibrahim so much that he made it right to sacrifice his honor status (whose financial condition is to buy a goat or another animal)
 islamic dharmaguru mufti shamoon qaasami kehete hai ki allaah ne jo paigaam hazrat ibrahim ko diya wo sirf unki aajamaaish kar rahe the
 So that this message can be given that for the decree of Allah, Muslims can sacrifice everything
 beton kii nahin ho sakati qurbaanimoulana hamid nomani se jab ye sawaal kiya gaya ki agar hazrat ibrahim kii churi hazrat ismil kii gardan par chalati to kya aaj tak bakreed ke maukey par ladakon kii qurbaani dene kaa rivaaj hota? is par moulana nomani ne jawaab diya ki nahin aisa bilkul nahin hota
 He told that Hazrat Ibrahim came to know about the sacrifice of his son only because Allah wanted to convey the message through his trials that everything in his path can be sacrificed
 yani koi aisi surat kabhi na ban sakati jisamen ladakon kii qurbaani dene kaa rivaaj shuru ho

 kairana loksabhaa upachunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye gorakhpur-phulpur kii tarj par vipaksh areldi ummidavaar tabassum hasan ko jitaane ke liye ekajute ho gaya he
 Tabassum faces Mriganka Singh, daughter of late BJP MP Hukum Singh
 haalanki aarpaar kii is chunavi jang main tabassum kii raah aasaan nahin dikh rahi, kyonki unke raste main apano ne hi kaante bicha rakhe hai
 SP, BSP and Congress have not fielded any candidate against RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan from family, but the biggest obstacle in their path is their brother-in-law Kanwar Hasan
 kanvar hasan lok dal se ummidavaar hai
 Apart from this, Municipal President Anwar Hassan from Tabassum's second brother-in-law Kairana is also campaigning against him
 tabassum hasan ke bhai wasim choudhary ko lekar musalamaanon ke ek tabake main kaaphi naaraazgi he
 It is being said that Congress leader Imran Masood is behind the arrival of Kanwar Hasan
 imran masood ke bhai salmaan baqayada kanvar hasan ke liye vot bhi maang rahe hai
 The opposition RLD has fielded Tabassum Hasan as a candidate for the oppositionrarana seat, which is not as cohesive as gorakhpur-phulpur, but the way it is seen in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls against the BJP, the scene is not visible here
 gorakhpur or phulpur main sapa ummidavaar ke liye bakaayadabasapakaryakarta vot maangate najar aae the
 Some SP leaders may be seen in Kairana, but BSP leaders are not ready to say anything
 sapa ke mulvot yadav matadaata is loksabhaa seat par bahut kam hai
 At the same time, no announcement has been made by the bsp-congress high command about the campaign yet
 donon partiyon se ab tak koi netaa chunaav prachaar main nahin utraa he
 Due to this, the workers are also silent
 nakud vidhansabha kshetra se basapa kaaryakarta naresh jatav kehete hai ki party kii ore se jo aadesh aayega, wo kiya jayega
 Nothing has been said at the moment
 lihaaja congress kaaryakarta ghar baithe hai
 Imran Masood comes from this parliamentary seat
 wo ek din bhi chunaav prachaar main nahin utre
 Masood says that i will not do any work beyond the party line, which will be the command of the high command, i will follow it
 maaloom ho ki kairana main upachunaav ke liye prachaar khatm hone main mahaj paanch din hi bache hai
 The Jats are not melting, the heat of the Dilmuzaffarnagar riots is still burning inside the people
 jat or muslimon ke bich badi dooriyaan puri tarah se pati nahin hai
 Although Tabassum Hasan is a candidate from RLD, despite this, the Jats do not appear to be successful in winning the hearts of the community
 jabaki yogi sarkaar jaaton ko saadhane ke liye mujffarnagar dange ke aropiyon se cese waapas lene kii taiyaari main he
 This can prove to be a trump card for the BJP in the Kairana election
 hindu banaam muslimkairana chunaav kii raajnneetik bisaat ko hindu banaam muslim banane kii bhi lagaataar koshish ho rahi he
 Five million of the 17 lakh voters of Kairana are Muslims
 isi kshetra se yogi sarkaar ke do mantri suresh rana or dharm singh saini hai
 While Suresh Rana is the face of Hindutva, Dharm Singh Saini has a presence in both Hindu and Muslim communities
 bijepi ummidavaar mriganka singh ke saath unka gurjar samudaay he
 Apart from this, Jat, Rajput and Saini votes are also the strength of Mriganka
 jatav matadaata bispi alaakaman ke farmaan ke intjaar main he, jabaki muslim maton main mriganka singh sendhamari karti dikh rahi hai

 BJP national president Amit Shah and film actor John Abraham were seen sharing the stage together, arriving at love-kush Ramlila, which is known for staging Delhi's grandest Ramlila stage
 is maukey par baat karte hue jon ne kaha ki wo ravan kaa role play karnaa chaahate hai
 Interestingly, when John Abraham was asked by a member of the love-kush Committee what role he would like to play in Ramlila when he got the chance, John said that Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva and he himself was very fond of Bholenath They believe that if they get a chance, they would like to play the role of Ravana
 bade parde par jald relies hogi pokharan main hue parmaanu pareekshan kii kahaneeramlila ke manch se film abhinayta jon abraham ne apni aane vaali film 'parmaanu' kaa pramotion bhi kiya
 John said that in the history of the atomic bomb, it is known for destruction
 jabaki film kii kahani kaa hissaa parmaanu ke behatar istemaal ke bare main he
 BJP national president Amit Shah wished the organizers of lav-kush Ramlila to convey the message of truth
 amit shah ne kaha ki asaty par satya kii jeet ko yaad karne kaa din he
 This platform of Ramlila will continue to carry the message of Satyamev Jayate everywhere
 iske baad lav-kush ramlila ke manch se amit shah or film abhinayta jon abraham ne tir chalaakar ravan dahan kiya
 Releasing the first look of John's film 'atomic: The Story of Pokhran', let us know that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was also discussed in love-kush Ramlila, although he did not appear on the stage
 bihar vidhansabha kaa chunaav agle saal hona he or jab uske pehle kai anya rajyon main chunaav hona he to us pariprekshya main bihar ke vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar bhavishyavaanee jaldibaji hogi lekin jo sanket mil rahe hai usase to keval ek baat saaf lag rahi he, or vah he nitish kumaar kaa ek baar phir mukhyamantri chunaa janaa
 In particular, this statement was received by three different incidents in Patna, Bihar's capital
 inkaa ek-duusare se koi sambandh nahin tha lekin sabakaa raajnneetik arth ek tha
 The first case is the Patna station where the milk market started under the rule of Lalu Yadav was broken and leveled
 raat main tejasvi yadav bhaage-bhaage virodh karne pahunche lekin phir kuch ghanton main apana dharna khatm kar diya
 This was the hallmark of the market Yadavs, especially Lalu Yadav and his party, holding on to the power of Bihar and Hanak
 is ilaake se maatr kuch sau meter kii duuri par bhaajapa ke saansad ramkripal yadav kaa ghar he
 But they did not even leave their home
 jo darshata he ki na keval lalu-tejasvi-ramkripal yadav yug kaa ant ho chukaa he balki inaki ab itani raajnneetik auqaat nahin bachi ki yadav samaaj kii izzat se zude ek doodh market ko jameendoj kiya ja rahaa tha tab ve kuch kar saken
 However, whenever there was an attempt to break this market in the name of beautification of Patna station, Lalu Yadav used to stop using his influence
 duusare maamle main bihar ke navaniyukt rajyapal phagu chouhan ne bhaajapa ke ati pichhadi jatiyon main se ek varg nonia, beldaar kanu mahasang ke binar tale yojit ek samaaroh main bhaag liya
 There was a call from Raj Bhavan especially to media persons to do coverage
 is kaarykram main bihar bhaajapa ke sabhi netaa manch par maujuud the
 Surely the BJP has not started a good tradition by calling the Governor on this platform but it is his problem that despite all efforts, he has not been able to cut the penetration of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in this section of the society
 or vah jaanati he ki is varg kaa jab tak nitish ko vishwaas hasil he tab tak bihar kii satta main parivartan ek bahes kaa vishay ho saktaa he lekin satta ke sheersh par iskaa asar nahin dikhegaa
 Like the leader of Bihar BJP, Nitish Kumar has given the opportunity to become members of Parliament for the most backward so far from the three seats in Bihar from Muzaffarpur, Jhanjharpur and Supaul, this time from Katihar and Jehanabad
 After that, just standing the governor in a caste conference will not melt the pulses
 shaayad is vaastaviktaa kaa andaja bhaajapa ke alaava rajd ko bhi he, isliye tejasvi yadav jab apane nae ghar main jate hai tab vahaan pehali baithak ati pichde samudaay kii karte hai
 On his word, now the community's most backward community has to share in the party and ticket
 lekin rajd ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki in ati pichhadi jatiyon ko jodne kii muhim or bihar kii raajnneeti main unka mahatv samajhane main lalu tejasvi ne bahut samay ganvaaya he
 It is useless to expect its results in next year's assembly elections, so they will have to wait till 2025
 vahiin nitish kii party vidhansabha chunaav ke liye poster lagaana shuru karti he to bhaajapa ke netaa susheel modi kii salaah hoti he ki endie main netritv par koi sanshay nahin, chunaav main samay he
 He would only mean Nitish Kumar and his supporters that the focus should be on development work
 susheel modi ko ye baat bhaleebhanti maaloom he ki bihar main agar vartmaan endie vidhansabha chunaav ek saath ladi to bahes kaa mudda yah hoga ki aakhir kya 2010 kii 206 siton par apni vijay kaa record or kitni adhik siton se todegi, kyonki bihar main endie or mahagathbandhan ke bich ab vot kaa antar bees pratishat se adhik kaa he jisko paatane kii kshamta philhal raajnneeti main nausikhia or vyavhaar main ghamandi tejasvi yadav ke paas nahin he
 Tejashwi will also fail to prevent Nitish from returning to power because his party was reduced to 22 seats when his father Lalu Yadav was in the fray in 2010 with Ram Vilas Paswan
 or jab ab paswan unke saath nahin tab saamaanya gyaan yahi bataata he ki endie kii siten badhengi or rajd 22 se kam siten jeetegi
 Anyway, when you will see the difference of victory in the assembly-wise seats in the Lok Sabha elections, then Tejashwi Yadav cannot just compensate by being active on social media
 jamini sachai yah bhi he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad puure desh kii tarah bihar main bhi bhaajapa kii lokapriyata or votaron main josh badha he
 One reason for this is to abolish Article 370 of Kashmir
 is nirnay ke baad kashmiri janata bhale pareshaani jhel rahi he lekin is desh main ek bade varg main isko lekar khushi he
 This is the core voter of the NDA and Nitish is well aware of this ground truth, so his party opposed the token in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and later supported the new law
 yah is baat kaa sanket he ki nitish apni vichaardhaara ke liye ab kursi ko daanv par lagane se rahe
 Anyway, Nitish is an accidental socialist who defines his theory from time to time in a new way
 isliye muddon par apane netaaon ke madhyam se party kii raay jarur rakhenge, jaise enarasi ke mudde par hua, lekin usko ek seemaa se zyaada tool nahin diya jayega
 In the coming time, if the Supreme Court's decision in the Ram temple case is in favor of building the temple, then if Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants, then Nitish will also stand in the queue to add the brick of the temple
 log bhul jate hai ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan nitish kumaar or unki party desh ke un gine chune dalon main se ek thi jisane apana ghoshnaa patr isliye nahin jari kiya ki bhaajapa ko usase pareshaani hoti
 Nitish did not interview any media people that they would ask him the question on which the BJP would have to be cleared by his answer
 yah baat alag he ki usee nitish kumaar ko chunaav parinaam aane ke baad bhaajapa ne khaali haath, matlab kendriya mantrimandal main unke manmutabik jagah die bina, patna lautne par majaboor kiya
 And this is the new BJP for which Nitish should put as many steps behind in his politics, but the present BJP assesses on the basis of its feedback and gives you the same sense
 bihar ke agle vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar sabase bada suspence isi baat ko lekar he ki kya bhaajapa ek baar apane balboote sarkaar banane kii koshish karegi
 The basis of this is that in the next few months, the BJP is going to form the government on its own in adjoining Jharkhand
 or jab bengal main vah votaron ke bich dhruvikaran karake mukhya vipaksh kii jagah le sakati he to bihar main kyon nahin
 But those making such demands should remember Amit Shah's advice to the media persons in Patna during the Lok Sabha elections that in Bihar, triangular politics is a truth and here they meant BJP and Janata Dal United, two came together and third The accident is fixed
 dikkat he ki nitish ke saamne cheharaa koun hoga or doosraa bhaajapa ke netaa maanate hai ki agar nitish phir jeet ke aa jaaen to puure desh kii raajnneeti main bhaajapa ke liye mushkil khadi kar sakate hai
 But both Nitish and the BJP, who are in power with each other in power, cannot find any other party and alliance
 lekin bhaajapa ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki nitish kumaar ke prati janata main kiye gaye kaam ke aadhaar par ek jo maun vot bank bana he wo unke har vaadon ko puraa hone ke saath dinondin badha he
 This cannot be ignored
 nitish kumaar kaa sabase bada raajnneetik dushman na rajd he or na bhaajapa, balki unka unki party ke khud ke poster ke anusaar ‘thike he‘ kii unki vartmaan maansikta
 It is believed that whoever is behind this poster and slogan is well acquainted with Nitish Kumar
 or shaayad usne apane nijee anubhav yaa nitish kumaar ke vyavhaar se tang aakar sabase upyukt shabd 'thike he' kaa chayan kiya
 Nitish Kumar's behavior is behind this
 ab chaahe vidhi vyavastha ho, yaa vikaas aalochana ko ve feedback nahin maanate or ghatnaon ko chunauti ke rup main nahin lete
 But they react the same to everything
 
 
 ek hi bite hoti he, ghatnaon ko koun roak saktaa he
 This is their reaction
 unke apane nirnay, jaise sharabbandi, jise mana jaataa he puure bihar ke police waalon ke liye har din bonus skim he, ke kaaran police tantra or bhrasht hui he
 a parallel system has been established in the society, and Nitish has hit the government treasury every year
 nitish kii yah yojana kitni safal he iskaa andaaza aapako bagal ke jharkhand or bengal ke aabkaari se hone vaale rajasav se lag jaaegi
 But in spite of that, he created a new army of criminals in the whole society, but still all is well
 
 
 jahaan ek ore sharabbandi ke kaaran ab bihar main aparaadh khaskar hatya kii ghatnaon main vruddhi ai he vahiin har ghar nal kaa jal ho, har vruddh ke liye pension ho yaa dalit yaa ati pichhadi jati ke chaatro ke kiye muft rashan kii vyavastha, yah sab aisi scimen hai jiske kaaran filhal agle saal nitish ke liye satta main vaapasi unke virdohi bhi maanate hai ki ek aupchaarikta hogi
 And if the NDA fought unitedly, it would have to be seen which party gets how many seats and who has a strike rate
 jahaan tak vipaksh kaa sawaal he to sabaki jigyaasa keval isamen hogi ki tejasvi or tejpratap apni seat bachaa paane main kaamyaab hote hai yaa nahin
 Whether we look at electoral equations or electoral arithmetic, Nitish Kumar is currently overshadowing his opponents in every way
 jharkhand main bhaajapa ke samarthan vaapasi ke baad alpamat main aayi shibu sorain sarkaar ne bahumat ke liye aavashyak samarthan juta paane main asafal rahane par ravivaar raat istipha dene kaa faisla kiya
 Shibu Soren met the Governor at around 10 pm and handed him his resignation
 isse pehle jharkhand ke upmukhyamantri or shibu sorain sarkaar main shaamil ol jharkhand student union (ajasu) ke adhyaksh sudesh kumaar mahato ne bataaya ki sarkaar main shaamil dalon ke sabhi 25 vidhayakon kii mukhyamantri shibu sorain kii adhyakshata main unke awaas par baithak hui, jisamen somvaar ko vidhansabha main vishwaas mat kaa saamana karne kii bajaay sarkaar kaa istipha dene kaa faisla kiya gaya
 It is known that after the withdrawal of the bjp's support of 18 mlas from the state's coalition government on May 24, the Shibu Soren government had the support of only 25 mlas in the 82-member assembly
 isse vah alpamat main aa gayi thi
 The Governor summoned the Chief Minister in the evening on the same day and directed to prove his majority in the Assembly by 31 May
 rajyapal ke nirdesh ke anusaar sarkaar ne vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr 31 may ko bulaayaa tha, jisamen usek apana bahumat sabit karnaa tha
 But despite seven days of tireless efforts, with no hope of support from the Congress with 14 mlas, Javimo with 11 mlas and his old partner BJP, 'guruji' finally decided to resign in order to avoid grudges in the House

 Two water plants in Delhi were closed on Sunday due to rising ammonia levels in the Yamuna river water
 is vajah se rajdhani main kai jagahon par pani kii killat ho sakati he
 According to Delhi Jal Board officials, the Chandrawal and Wazirabad plants supplying water to the Cantt area besides Central and North Delhi were closed after midnight on Saturday
 plant main marammat kaa kaam jari he, lekin subah 7 baje tak production shuru hone kii ummid nahin
 According to these officials, if production from the plant starts in the morning, then by Monday evening water supply will be normal
 haalanki dilli kejal mantrikapil mishra kaa kahana he ki somvaar subah 7 baje pani ristor ho jayega
 But the thing to note here is that the production of water takes 5 hours
 aise main puri sambhaavna he ki somvaar subah dilli waalon ke liye pani kaa sankat barkaraar rahegaa
 There is also a double attack of water crisis because in the absence of water from the canal, water from Yamuna is treated in the plant, but it is difficult to treat the water of Yamuna in the Wazirabad plant, because it has been here since Sunday morning
 Ammonia levels are constantly increasing
 aapako bataa den ki dilli ko haryana se rojaanaa lagbhag 1000 kusek pani kariyar-lind channel sielsi or kachi nahar ke zariye miltaa he
 Out of this, about 650 cusecs of water is supplied from CLC and the remaining 350 cusecs from raw canal
 sielsi se aane vaale pani main ammonia nahin hota, jabaki kachi nahar se supplai kiye gaye pani main ammonia kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Currently, the 650 cusec of CLC has caused damage to the dam and rising ammonia in the Yamuna has tied both hands of the Delhi Jal Board and the water crisis has deepened in the country's capital
 bataa den ki wazirabad plant main har din 120 mjidi (milian galen) or chandraval plant se 93 mjidi pani kaa production hota he, jabaki vahiin okhla plant main 20 mjidi tathaa dwarka plant se har din 40 mjidi pani kaa production hota he

 While the number of private health centers is more than two lakhs

 Or, for treatment, the government has handed over everything in private hands
 lekin sawaal he ki sarkaar ilaaj ke liye nagarikon par kharch karti kitna he? to sarkaar prati maheene prati vyakti par 92 rupee 33 paise kharch karti he
 The situation is not just serious in that the government spends very little
 halaat is myne main traasadee daayak he ki kisi kii jindagi kisi kii kamai he
 In 2018-19, the health budget of the country is 52 thousand crores, then the budget of private health care has been about 7 lakh crores
 mushkil to ye bhi he ki ab doctoron ko bhi sarkari system par bharosa nahin he
 Because 90 percent of the doctors in the country work in private hospitals

 Pediatrician Dr r n Singh, who is trying to eradicate encephalitis in Purvanchal, termed the reduction in death from JE and AES as a major achievement, saying that the government launched a 'dastak' campaign by prioritizing prevention last year to prevent the epidemic i have succeeded unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh main ise niyantrit kar liya gaya magar bihar, pashchim bengal, assam sahit desh ke kul 17 pradeshon main ise kaise kaabo kiya jayega? desh se iske unmoolan ke liye rashtriya kaarykram chalaaya janaa chaiye
 Singh said that the 'national Program for Prevention and Control of Encephalitis' was ready in the year 2014 itself, but it has not been implemented till now

 From Alagiri where to face challenges
 vahiin, rajya main badalte raajnneetik sameekaran bhi unke saamne kisi agnipariksha se kam nahin hai
 Let us tell you that Karunanidhi pushed back his trusted party captain like his won Ji Vaiko and made a political place for Stalin
 lekin stallin ko puri swaittata nahin di or vito apane paas rakhaa
 But today he is being formally handed over the command of the party
 bade bhai alaagiri hi sabase badi chunautikarunanidhi ko apane jivan kaal main hi uttaradhikari stallin or bete em ke alaagiri ke bich sangharsh se rubaru hona padaa tha
 Karunanidhi expelled Alagiri from the party in 2014 due to Stalin's opposition
 karunanidhi ke nidhan ke baad alaagiri ne stallin ke khilaaf sabase badi chunauti banakar khadey hai
 Alagiri has called a big rally on 5 September
 is raily ke saath hi vah apni bhavishya kii ranneeti kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 If Alagiri forms a new party, he may join Stalin's opponents
 aise main dakshini rajyatamilnadumein stallin ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 This is why Alagiri is presenting himself as Karunanidhi's successor
 karunanidhi kii viraasat ko aage le jane kii chunauteestallin ke saamne karunanidhi kii viraasat ko aage le jane kii sabase badi chunauti he
 Karunanidhi managed to carve out a niche among big legends (such as Periyar Ramaswamy, CN Annadurai, Kamaraj, MG Ramachandran, c Rajagopalachari)
 jabaki stallin ko abhi apane aapako sabit karne kii sabase badi chunauti he
 Although Karunanidhi provided a platform of leadership to Stalin and being the son of Karunanidhi also gives him the respect of party leaders and workers, the biggest challenge is to bring the party to power
 2019 ke loksabhaa or upachunavstallin ke netritv kii pehali pariksha 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav he
 The party was defeated in the 2016 Assembly elections fought under the leadership of Stalin
 isse pehle 2011 main diemke ne rajya main satta ganvaa di thi or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ko karaari maat mili thi
 In this way, a big responsibility to win the party in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections will be on the shoulders of Stalin
 ediemke ke khilaaf keval satta virdohi lahar ke bharose chunaav jeetna aasaan nahin he, kyonki rajya main kai raajnneetik vikalp khadey ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, Stalin has the biggest challenge to increase his appeal among the voters and win their trust
 upachunaav hoga litmas testastallin ke netritv kii pehali pariksha 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle thiruparankandrum or tiruvarur vidhansabha seat par hone vaala upachunaav hoga
 Apart from winning the by-election, Stalin has to balance with the seniors in the party and the challenge is to take them together after Karunanidhi
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki upachunaav main jeet hi party ke bheetar or baahar stallin kaa aalochakon ko jawaab hoga
 Kamal haasan-rajinikanthtamilnadu has two big star entries in Tamil politics
 camel hasan or rajanikant ne apni-apni raajnneetik party banaakar rajya main apane staradam kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahate hai
 Both the actors are very good fans, due to which they are trying to make their place in politics
 dakshin kii raajnneeti main kai abhinaytaon ne apane staradam kaa phayda uthaaya bhi he
 In such a situation, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth can pose a big challenge in front of Stalin
 bijepi entry karne kii jugat mentamilnadu kii siyasat main bijepi kaa koi khaas janaadhar nahin he
 Despite this, the BJP has not given up hope in the state
 bijepi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan ke jariye apni jaden jamaana chaahati he
 In view of this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President have visited the state many times
 karunanidhi kii beemaari ke dauraan modi unhen dekhne gaye or nidhan ke baad antim sanskaar main bhi pahunche
 Apart from this, after the death of Jayalalithaa, there has been a political upheaval in AIADMK
 usase bijepi ko ummid najar ai hai
 The BJP also has Rajinikanth as an option
 iske alaava bijepi ke paas modi jaisaa kaddavar cheharaa he
 This is a big challenge for the DMK
 stallin kaise karenge jod-tod?karunanidhi raajnneetik jod-tod main maahir the
 As a result of this, Stalin does not have the same experience at times when the Congress sometimes aligned with the BJP
 unhone ab tak kisi anya party se gathbandhan nahin kiya he
 He has an alliance with the Congress
 stallin ke adhikansh salaahkaar bhi peshewar hai jinhen raajnneetik ukhaad-pachhad kaa koi anubhav nahin he

 Political bylaws have been laid for the by-elections in 12 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh
 upachunaav ko lekar bijepi or bispi netaaon kii baithken ho rahi hai
 At the same time, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has become active after returning from abroad
 is upachunaav main kannauj loksabhaa seat se chunaav haar chukin dimple yadav ke upachunaav main utarane ke kayaas lagaae jane lage hai?sapa ke kaddavar netaa or party ke muslim cheharaa maane jane vaale ajam khan is baar loksabhaa chunaav main rampur sansadeey seat se saansad chune gaye hai, jiske baad unhone vidhayak pad se istipha de diya he
 Due to this, the Rampur assembly seat has become vacant, where the by-election is to be held
 sutron kii maane to ajam khan apni rampur vidhansabha seat se sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav ko chunaav ladaana chaahate hai
 For this, he has proposed to the SP President
 haalanki akhilesh yadav ne is par abhi hami nahin bhari he
 While Dimple is fully guaranteed to win Azam Khan
 charchaa is baat kii he ki bijepi rampur vidhansabha main ek baar phir jayprada par daanv laga sakati he
 In view of this possibility, Azam Khan has made up his mind to field Dimple Yadav in the electoral battle so that he can maintain his supremacy in Rampur by defeating BJP
 kannauj sansadeey seat se is baar dimple yadav chunaav haar gai hai
 He is defeated by bjp's Subrata Pathak
 vahiin, akhilesh yadav azamgarh seat se jitkar sansad pahunch chuke hai
 The next Lok Sabha election is five years later
 aise main dimple yadav agar vidhansabha chunaav ladakar jeet hasil karti hai to upi vidhansabha main party kaa netritv kar sakati hai
 The political equation of Rampur assembly seat is also in favor of SP
 yah seat ajam khan kii paramparaagat maani jaati hai, yahaan se 1980 se isi seat se chunaav jeet darj karte aa rahe hai
 Azam Khan got his first and last defeat in Rampur in the 1996 assembly elections
 is chunaav ko chhod den to ajam khan 1980 se lagaataar rampur vidhansabha seat se vidhayak nirvaachit hote aa rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, this is the reason why Azam Khan wants to field Dimple Yadav from his traditional assembly seat
 haalanki party ke kuch netaa nahin chaahate hai ki diphl yadav rampur seat se chunavi maidan main utre
 He feels that if Dimple Yadav contests from Rampur and manages to win, the credit will go to Azam Khan and his stature in the party will increase further

 In the subsequent Lok Sabha elections, when JDU was in decline, Nitish once again resigned from the post of CM, taking moral responsibility for it and placed Jitan Ram Manjhi on the chair

 Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara said on Monday that fast bowler Dhammika Prasad will not play against India in the second Test match starting on Tuesday but mysterious spinner Ajanta Mendis is likely to be given a chance in this match
 prasad ne ahmedabad ke pehle test match main vivies lakshmana or mahendra singh dhoni ke keemtee wicket liye the lekin vahaan unke ghutane ke neeche kii nas main khinch gayi thi or sangakaara ne kaha team is 26 varshiya baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj ke naam par vichaar nahin kar rahi he haalanki farm main chal rahe tillakaratne dilashaan ke saath aisa maamla nahin he jinaki kal footbal khelte hue naak tut gayi thi
 Sangakkara said, 'dilshan's nose was broken but now he is feeling good
 dhammika kii nas khinch gayi thi lekin uski recovery acchhee he
 However, we are not yet considering his name
 ' muthaiya muralidharan ne ahmedabad main rangana herath ke saath spin vibhaag kii jimmedaari sanbhali thi lekin unhen khaas safalataa nahin mili thi tathaa sangakaara ne kaha ki mendis ko antim ekadash main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 He said 'ajanta has always been a part of our strategy
 hamaari team main jo aatmavishvaas or santulan he use dekhte hue ham yadi chahen to teen spinneron ke saath khel sakate hai
 Or we can replace any other fast bowler in place of Dhammika Prasad

 If one player is unsuccessful, the others perform
 ham apane sabhi khilaadiyon par vishwaas karte hai or maanate hai ki ve bahut achche hai
 We often use Dilshan as a stop-gap spinner
 aakhir main yah puri team kaa prayaas hota he
 Motera scored 1598 runs on a flat wicket and Harbhajan Singh called it a bad thing for Test cricket but Sangakkara did not consider it a big issue
 unhone kaha, 'wicket kaaphi sapaat tha lekin hamen sab tarah kii pichon par acha pradarshan karne ke liye khud ko taiyaar karnaa hoga
 You have to keep trying
 kai baar aapaki koshish kaamyaab hoti he or kai baar nahin lekin yadi aap koshish jari rakhte ho to kuch acha hone kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hai
 Regarding the pitch of Green Park, Sangakkara said, "it has more grass but is also quite dry

 North Korea's dictator Marshall Kim Jong Un's craze has blocked trade routes around the world
 upar se sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandhon ne rahi sahi kasar puri kar di
 Now the situation is that the whole North Korea seems to be stuck in a huge crisis
 khabaren aa rahi hai ki uttar korea ke paas ab indhan bhi khatm hone kii kagaar par he
 He does not even have money to buy fuel
 tabaahi kaa jimmedaar kimakim jong un kii sanak ke chalate uske mulk kaa bahut bura haal hone vaala he
 North Korea will now have to be ready to bear the brunt of the trouble that is coming due to the dictator's arbitrary policies
 is tabaahi kaa zimmedaar koi or nahin balki khud taanashaah kim jong un hoga
 Because this disaster on his country has brought Kim Jong Un himself
 tel kaa akaal!uttar korea main ye tabaahi akaal ke rup main aane vaali he
 The effect of the United Nations and American sanctions is now that there is going to be a huge oil famine in the country
 or agar aisa hua to is mulk main bam or misile to hongi magar tel nahin
 The world knows the meaning of the end of oil
 na is desh main kaam hoga
 Neither will there be grain in people's homes
 yani bhukhmaree ke halaat paidaa ho jaaenge
 Life will stop grih yuddh hone kii sambhaavnaaen prabal ho jaaengi
 Kim's game ended in direct words; North Korea is going to have a famine
 kyonki uttar korea main ab khatm hone ko he tel
 But the question is, how did this situation become in North Korea
 ham aapako bataaenge aakhir kaise hua taanashaah kaa tel khatm or tel khatm hone kaa matlab saaf he
 Kim's game over
 hathiyaaron par lutaaya khajanamgar chintaa kii baat ye he ki taanashaah kii kerani kaa fal puraa uttar korea bhugtegaa
 Now you must be thinking what has Kim Jong Un done to make the country come to an end in oil, then listen to Kim Jong Un he has done what no one can imagine to rule the country
 usne vinaashkari hathiyaaron par apana khajaana lutaa diya
 Billions of rupees have been spent on test missiles in Korea
 usne ski resort ke mahatvakankshi project par beshumaar daulat ganvaa di
 Now this extravagance is having a direct impact on the economy of the country
 The oil money spent in nuclear weapons has now resulted in the North Korean treasury being emptied due to Kim Jong Un's unaccounted spending
 usee khajaane ke jariye wo duusare deshon se tel or indhan kharida karata tha
 However, under the restrictions of the United Nations and the United States, North Korea's oil imports are already heavily banned
 lekin, ab jo kuch ummid bachi thi, wo bhi apane aap ko duniya main sabase taqatvar dikhaane kii kim jong un kii sanak par qurbaan ho gai
 Because Kim Jong-un has used almost all of the funds for the purchase of petroleum materials on his destructive missiles and nuclear weapons
 sabase bada khajaana khalisutron kaa daawa he ki kim jong un ke pita kim jong il ne petroleum indhan kii kharid ke liye khaas fund bana rakhaa tha
 But Kim used it poorly to increase the range of his missiles
 lihaaja halaat bekaabu hote ja rahe hai kyonki kim kaa sabase bada khajaana khaali ho chukaa he
 Come from coal exports, now let us tell you from where North Korean dictator Kim Jong brings money to fulfill those arms craze
 uttar korea ko baari maatra main videshi mudra koyale ke niryaat se hasil hoti he
 As such, the United Nations and the United States have banned coal exports to North Korea since August 2017
 baavjood iske khabar he ki rus kii madad se wo koyale kaa kaarobaar kar rahaa he
 The second source of North Korea's earnings is the alleged mysterious organization Office Number 39, a forgery and drugs business
 ye sanghathan north korea workars party kii ore se chalaaya jaataa he or kaha jaataa he ki iske jariye jaalsaji or drugs ke kaarobaar jaisi avaidh gatividhiyon ke sahare salanaa arabon dollar kii ugaahi hoti he
 At the same time, about 1 lakh North Korean citizens settled abroad send about $ 500 million each year
 or niryaat kaarobaar se uttar korea kii maamuli kamai hoti he
 Unbearable spending on missile testing is evident, it is not easy for North Korea to run its economy in limited earnings
 wo bhi tab jabaki kim jong un jaise sanakee shaasha ho
 Which can be seen with nothing but atom bombs and missiles
 kim jong un ke shashan main ai missile teston kii baadh par beshumaar kharch ne uttar korea kii mali haalat kii qamar tod kar rakh di
 During Kim's rule, there were about 20 major missile tests on which an infinite amount of money was shed
 khul gai rus kii polhalanki uttar korea ke paas china or rus jaise dost bhi hai
 Those who are accused of secretly supplying oil to North Korea
 lekin, america kii paini nazar or satellite servilans se china kii chori batch na saki
 In such a situation, it is not possible for China to give North Korea oil by ignoring international restrictions
 or ab jo tasviren saamne ai hai, unamem uske duusare dost yani rus kii pole bhi kholkar rakh di he

 Ayushman Khurana (shibi) starrer 'hawaiianzada' has three conditions of play
 film ke kathanak se ek raay yah banati he ki film ke lekhak or nirdeshak vibhu puri vaidic gyaan main ruchi rakhte hai
 Through the story of Shivkar Bapuji Talpade in 'hawaiianada', he has tried to establish the myths of Vedic knowledge
 haalanki vaidic gyaan main ruchi rakhane waalon ke liye yah film mahatvapurn lagegi or ve log iskaa bachaav karenge
 But in the current political scenario, this film is sure to get discussed in the form of criticism, as Home Minister Rajnath Singh gets into the discussion about his statements that when the solar eclipse will happen, it will tell the Pandits of the locality
 'hawaijada' kii kahani gumnaam (maaf kijiega aaj se pehle main bhi unhen nahin jaanata tha) vaigyanik shivkar talapade kii he, jinhone rhite bandhuon se aath saal pehle pehla hawaii jahaaj udaaya tha? haalanki shivkar talapade ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree uplabdh he, lekin film menayushmaan khuranane shivkar kii bhoomika ke saath nyaay karne kii bharsak koshish kii he
 The entire film rests on Ayushmann's shoulder
 haalanki shivkar ke guru or vaidic vidwaan shastri kii bhoomika main mithun chakravarti ne bhi puraa jor lagaaya he
 The film has many ups and downs, needless songs and Shibi's love story have given the film a lot of hiccups
 lihaaja kursi par baitha darshak jamhai bhi khub letaa he
 This makes the film weak
 vibhu purike liye behatar hota agar sirf shivkar talapade ke udaan bharne kii kahani par focus rakhte, lekin shibi kii prem kahani dikhaane main film behad kamjor ho gai he
 With Ayushmann and Mithun Chakraborty coming on screen, as soon as the film comes to life, in the next scene, the film goes flat and the viewer's mind gets upset
 'yug sahastra yojan par bhanu
 
 ' ke saath khagoleey sutron ko sulajhane vaale vaidic vidwaan shastri kii bhoomika main mithun chakravarti ne acha kaam kiya he, haalanki pallavi sharada ke hisse kuch bhi nahin aayaa he or vah keval shopis banakar rah gai he
 It is not that there is nothing good in 'hawaiian'
 film kii cinemetography, drishyon kii gaharaai, prakaash or shades ke liye tarif kii jaani chahie or yah kaha ja saktaa he ki 'hawaijada' ayushmaan khurana ke saath savita singh kii bhi film he, jinhone badhiya kaam kiya he
 The hard work of the film's production designers is also seen on the screen
 film kaa sampadan agar ksaa hua hota, to darshakon ko baandhe rakhane main film ko adhik safalataa milti
 The fact that Vibhu Puri has used to write his story about Shivkar Bapuji Talpade is like footnotes
 film kii kahani main jahaan darshak gaharaai or vishleshan kii ummid karata he, vibhu puri ne vahaan gaanon kaa sahaara liya he, jo film ko kamjor banaate hai
 The music of the film will play in the background as soon as it comes down from the screen of Hawaiian
 kyonki usamen aisa kuch bhi nahin he, jo darshak ke mastishk patal par apni chhap chhod sake
 In favor of his story, Vibhu argues that three years ago NASA had talked about making mercury-powered aircraft
 puri shivkar talapade ke bhattije (narayan talapade) kii maut kii taarikh bhi bataate hai
 But not much information about Shivkar is available in the public sphere
 lihaaja vibhu puri kaa paksh kamjor pad jaataa he
 Although 'hawaiizada' is Vibhupuri's first film, the theme he has chosen for it
 uske liye unki saraahna kii jaani chahie
 In Bollywood, the custom of making films on Vedic knowledge and sutras has been negligible, but Vibhu Puri has started it through 'hawaiian'
 agar trikonmiti (trignometry) ko jya(sine) or kojya(cosine) kii bhashaa main padhaa he, to 'hawaijada' ke dhai ghante kaatane aapke liye mushkil nahin honge
 This picture is on 14 December, the day the news channel was waiting for the exit poll, the Prime Minister's roadshow has taken place and the Election Commission sent a notice to Rahul Gandhi for his interview
 aap in tasveeron ko dekhte hue khud bhi tay kar sakate hai ki rajasthan ke udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar kii chat par dharmik dhvaj fahraa dene kii yah tasviir un tamaam khabaron kii praathamikta main sabase upar honi chahie thi
 In a way, it was good that the media ignored the incident that day, do you know that this would only spoil the atmosphere, but can this incident be ignored forever
 kya is ghatana par baat nahin honi chahie taaki is bheed main shaamil noujvaan jo kisi dharmik unmaad yaa jaays gusse ke sahare hi sahi, adaalat kii taraf daude chale aae the, is tasviir ko phir se dekhen or thande man se vichaar karen ki ve kya karne ja rahe the
 The courage to settle the matter outside the process of law on the debates and talk of Hindu Muslim is not only fatal for the society, but can also pose a big challenge for the institutions of law and order
 rajasthan ke udaipur kii adaalat ke get kii chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj lahraane kii yah tasviir samvidhan kii banaai tamaam maryaada se khilwaad karti he
 When you see the national flag waving at the dome of the Supreme Court, there is awe that this institution is committed to justice for all in the shadow of the national flag
 kya aap yah sahan kar sakenge ki koi supreme court ke upar tirange ke alaava koi or dhvaj fahraa de, kya aap yah bhi bardaasht kar sakenge ki adaalat kii kaarywahi ko prabhavit karne ke liye baahar badi sankhya main log narebaazi karne ja rahe ho
 We stop at the door of justice, keep an eye on him that the decision will come and the rule will be based on the law and the evidence
 pichley teen saal ke dauraan tirange ke lekar kitni bahes hui
 When the students took out a democratic procession in the university, it was said that they lack nationalism, so the tricolor will be hoisted at the height of 207 there
 19 farvari 2016 ke akhabaaron or website check kiijie
 Vice Chancellors of all central universities met with then HRD Minister Smriti Irani
 isamen faisla hua ki sabhi kendriya vishvavidhyalay rashtriya dhvaj lagaayenge
 First the tricolor will be hoisted in JNU, while there is already tricolor
 akhabaaron main chapa tha ki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ke chaatro main ekta or sauhaard kii bhaavana paidaa karne ke liye yah faisla liya gaya he or is kadam se majboot bharat kaa sandesh jayega
 In the context of this decision, the incident of waving saffron flag on the roof of the entrance of Udaipur court in Rajasthan should be seen
 kya in logon main ekta or sauhaard kii bhaavana kam he, kya rashtriya dhvaj ke prati sammaan kii bhaavana kam he jo apane sanghathan kaa dhvaj lekar chat par chadh gaye or fahraa aae
 On 14 December, this young man climbed to the roof of Udaipur court carrying the saffron flag
 neeche uske samarthakon kii bheed khadi thi
 The flag has a picture of Jayashree Ram and Ram Ji
 abhi tak is noujvaan kii pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 Which organization are these people associated with, it has also not been identified
 hamaare sahyogi sanjay vyas kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar pradarshnkaree shahar se baahar ke the
 On December 14, there were several clashes between the police and them
 police jitani baar inhen hataati, ye log duusari jagah jamaa ho jate the
 By evening, Udaipur had gathered outside the court premises and the atmosphere there became fierce
 tabhi kuch noujvaan adaalat parisar kii chat par chadh gaye or bhagava dhvaj laharaa diya
 Think, neither the address of the organization nor the address of identity and so many people come to the court and hoist the flag on its roof
 police ne usadin tatparta se karrwai na kii hoti to maahaul or karaab ho saktaa tha
 You must have seen a video a few days ago, in which Shambhulal Rager murders and burns Afrazul, a laborer from Bengal and then also makes the video
 shambhulaal rajsamand kaa rahane vaala tha jo udaipur se 70 kimi he
 Rajsamand has a separate district court
 udaipur main jo log jamaa hue the wo muslim sabha ke sadasyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahe the
 Offensive slogans were being raised in which a video of the Muslim gathering went viral
 police ne viral hue video ke maamle main 10 logon ko giraftaar kiya tha, chaar abhi jail main he or chah kii zamaanat ho gai he
 The police should also treat them strictly and should be asked who they are doing well by raising such slogans
 kya wo kisi javaabi bheed ke liye jaanboojh kar aag laga rahe hai
 Afrajul has been murdered, shameful, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also said that the incident is shameful and the police have not delayed the arrest, but where did the courage to raise such slogans by raising a magma
 aise logon par bhi police ko lagaataar nazar rakhni chahie
 The question is that even if the demand of the Hindu organization was true, was it right that they would come to the court in protest and climb the roof and wave the saffron flag
 kya in yuvaaon ke man main samvidhan ke prati koi sammaan nahin bachaa tha
 It is a matter of honor that the protesters did not touch the place where the tricolor is actually flying
 aaj bhi udaipur kii adaalat parisar main aaj bhi tirangaa mahfuz he
 Home Minister of Rajasthan Gulabchand Kataria also comes from Udaipur
 kya sarkaar ko is ghatana ko lekar vishesh satarkta nahin baratani chahie
 If the crowd continues to gain its strength through religious identity, what can be the situation? kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki is tarah kii ghatana antim he
 Could we ever imagine that such a picture would be seen, there would be a court complex, there would be a crowd outside and someone would stand with a saffron on the roof
 police ne udaipur kii ghatana ke maamle main us din 200 logon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 There were many who went there for their court work
 baad main sabhi ko zamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 If a wrong picture of the tricolor is seen, then the Twitter world becomes active
 tivi channelon main tufaan khadaa ho jaataa he
 Can it be so easy for the media and society to forget the Udaipur incident
 sanvaidhanik daayityon se las kisi bhi raajnneetik pahchaan ke nagarikon ko kya is tasviir se satark nahin ho janaa chahie
 We want to show the statement of the IG of Udaipur police which he said while talking to the media on the day of the incident
 haalat yah he ki twit par kuch log mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii bhi aalochana karne lage ki unhone pradarshnakariyon par karrwai kyon hone di
 Such arguments are also getting place and people are getting comfortable with such incidents
 kai logon ne is ghatana kii ninda bhi kii
 Do not look at this incident with sentiment or anger, look at it with a cool head and think if we have lost all the opportunities for dialogue
 kya dharmik vajahon ko lekar koi is had tak ugr ho saktaa he ki adaalat kii imaarat ke kareeb pahunch jaae
 Our colleague Munne Bharti spoke to Prashant Bhushan, he also risks speaking first in such cases
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich kai baar takaraav kii naubat aati he
 Taking advantage of such a situation, the crowd should be built, it should be taken to the court, what should have been done, you should consider it
 aisi kisi bhi bheed jise adaalat or kanoon kaa khoff na ho, hamaare samaaj ko kaise badal rahi he
 Everyone should understand how our attitude towards constitutional institutions changes
 main shanivaar ko goa main tha
 Saw a poster on a wall there
 yah poster hindu jan jagriti samiti kaa he
 This poster has written about the honor of the national flag
 kaha gaya he ki plastic ke dhvaj kaa istamaal na karen, chehre or sharir par raashtra dhvaj kii akruti na banaaen
 If found the national flag somewhere, submit it with respect to the government office, but these young men of Udaipur gathered in the name of some unknown Hindu organization and came to the court premises and waved Ram flag on the roof
 kya hindu jaagran samiti ke lihaaz se aisa karnaa raashtra dhvaj kaa sammaan hoga? hamaare saamne do tarah ke hindu sanghathanon kaa nazariyaa, faisla aap kiijie
 Our colleague Sushil Kumar Mohapatra spoke to retired Justice Sodhi
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika is tarah se nahin chal sakati he
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra also spoke to Rajya Sabha member and lawyer KTS Tulsi
 hamane rajasthan ke mahadhivaktaa ko bhi phone kiya magar baat nahin hui
 It is expected that the Law Minister of the country or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will take cognizance of this incident
 kisi kisi awaazen aa rahi hai
 BJP MLA from Madhya Pradesh's Guna Panna Lal Shakya is giving a speech on why Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma got married outside the country
 vidhayak ji kah rahe hai ki is desh main ram kaa vivaah hua he, krishna kaa hua he, yudhisthir kaa hua he, aap logon kaa bhi hua he, magar donon ne videsh main shaadi kii
 Earned money from here and took money abroad
 aakhir ye soch kahaan se aa rahi he
 Talking about being said to be anti-religion, in talking vidhayak ji jis manch se bhaashan de rahe the, us par pradhanmantri modi kaa hi poster nazar aa rahaa tha
 Another picture came these days
 tippaniyan On Saturday, a former Chief Justice SN Bhargava touched the feet of Asaram Bapu, who appeared in court from Jodhpur jail
 aam taur par police kisi kaidi ke kareeb jane se rokatii he magar justise bhargav ne unke paanv chhu liye
 Should a former Chief Justice of the High Court have done this, will a good message go to the people towards justice
 justise bhargav sikkim ke rajyapal bhi rah chuke hai
 Have we lost the courage to call the wrong wrong or now many people have started agreeing to such incidents, including the media
 ek nazariyaa yah ho saktaa he ki in naujavaanon se sakhti se pesh aayaa jaae, yah hona chahie magar meraa nazariyaa kuch or bhi he
 Someone should talk to all the youth who hoist saffron at the entrance of Muslim Sabha and Udaipur court
 kya ve naukari na milane se pareshaan hai, unke bheetar dharm ko lekar itnaa gussa kaise aa jaataa he, kisaan aatmahatya karte hai, use lekar unke bheetar karuna yaa system ke prati gussa kyon nahin aata he
 We have to talk to them with an eye, and ask why they are deliberately putting their lives and the lives of others at stake, has any big organization promised them something, someone is promising to save them, What is the matter
 baat karne se hi pataa chalegaa
 Shouldn't this incident be talked about so that the youth in this crowd who came right to the court with the help of some religious frenzy or justified anger, look at this picture again and consider what they do with a cold heart Were going hindu muslim ke dibet or baat baat par kanoon kii prakriya se baahar maamle ko nipataane kaa saahas samaaj ke liye ghaatak to he hi, kanoon vyavastha kii sansthaaon ke liye bhi badi chunauti ban saktaa he
 This picture of climbing the roof of the gate of the court of Udaipur, Rajasthan, blossoms with the dignity created by the Constitution
 jab aap supreme court ke gumbad par rashtriya dhvaj ko laharaate dekhte hai to shraddha umadti he ki yah sanstha raashtra dhvaj kii chaaya main sabake liye nyaay ke prati patibaddh he
 Will you be able to bear that someone hoists any flag other than the tricolor above the Supreme Court, will you be able to tolerate that a large number of people are going to shout slogans to influence the court proceedings
 ham insaaf ke darvaaze par jaakar ruuk jate hai, uski taraf nigaah kiye rahete hai ki faisla aayega or niyam kanoon or sabooton ke aadhaar par aayega
 During the last three years, there was so much debate about the tricolor
 uniwarsity main chaatro ne loktantric juluus nikaale to kaha gaya ki unamem rashtrawaad kii kami he, isliye vahaan 207 kii oonchai par tirangaa fahraaya jayega
 Check the newspapers and website of 19 February 2016
 tab kii maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ke saath sabhi kendriya vishvavidhyalayon ke vaais chancelaron kii baithak hui
 It was decided that all the central universities would put up the national flag
 sabase pehle jeenyu main tirangaa lehregaa, jabaki vahaan pehle se hi tirangaa laharaata rahaa he
 It was published in the newspapers that this decision has been taken to instill a sense of unity and harmony among the students of higher education institutions and this move will send the message of a strong India
 is faisle ke sandarbh main rajasthan ke udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lahraane kii ghatana ko dekha janaa chahie
 Is there less of a sense of unity and harmony among these people, is there less of a sense of respect for the national flag, who climbed the roof and hoisted the flag of their organization
 14 disambar ke din yah noujvaan udaipur kii adaalat kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lekar chadh gaya
 a crowd of his supporters stood below
 dhvaj par jayshri ram or ram ji kii tasviir he
 This youngster has not been identified yet
 ye log kis sanghathan se jude hai, isaki bhi pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 Our colleague Sanjay Vyas says that most of the protesters were from outside the city
 14 disambar ko police or inke bich kai baar jhadap hui
 The number of times the police removed them, these people used to gather elsewhere
 shaam hote hote udaipur adaalat parisar ke baahar jamaa ho gaye or vahaan bhi maahaul ugr ho gaya
 Then some youngsters climbed onto the roof of the court complex and waved the saffron flag
 sochie, na sanghathan kaa pataa na pahchaan kaa pataa he or adaalat main itane log aa bhi jate hai or uski chat par dhwaja bhi laharaa dete hai
 Had the police not acted promptly on that day, the atmosphere could have worsened
 aapane kuch din pehle ek video dekha hoga, jisamen shambhulaal raigar bengal se aae mazdoor afaraazul kii hatya karata he or jala kar maar detaa he or phir video bhi banaata he
 Shambhulal was a resident of Rajsamand which is 70 km from Udaipur
 rajsamand main alag zila adaalat he
 Those who had gathered in Udaipur were demanding action against the members of the Muslim assembly
 muslim sabha kaa koi video viral hua tha, jisamen aapattijanak naare lagaae ja rahe the
 Police arrested 10 people in connection with the viral video, four are still in jail and six have been given bail
 police ko inase bhi sakhti se pesh aana chahie or poocha janaa chahie ki aise naaron ko lagaakar wo kiskaa bhala kar rahe hai
 Are they deliberately setting fire to a counter-attack
 afrajul kii hatya hui he, sharmnaak he, mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bhi kaha he ki ghatana sharmnaak he or police ne giraftaar main deree nahin kii he, lekin majamaa lagaakar aise naare lagane kii himmat kahaan se ai
 Police should also keep a constant watch on such people
 sawaal he ki agar hindu sanghathan kii maang sahi bhi thi to bhi kya yah sahi tha ki ve pradarshan karte hue adaalat tak aate or chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj laharaa dete
 Had no respect for the Constitution left in the minds of these youths
 ganimat he ki pradarshnakariyon ne us jagah ko nahin chhedaa jahaan vaaki tirangaa laharaa rahaa hota he
 Even today, the tricolor is still safe in the court premises of Udaipur
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ji bhi udaipur se hi aate hai
 Should the government not take special caution about this incident? agar isi tarah bheed apni takat dharmik pahchaan se hasil karti rahi to halaat kya ho sakate hai
 Can we say with the claim that such an event is final
 kya ham kabhi soch sakate the ki aisi tasviir dekhne ko milegi, adaalat kaa parisar hoga, baahar bheed hogi or chat par koi bhagava liye khadaa hoga
 Police had detained 200 people that day in connection with the Udaipur incident
 kai aise bhi the jo apane adalati kaam se vahaan gaye the
 All were later released on bail
 tirangaa kii ek galat tasviir dikh jaati he to twitor jagat sakriy ho jaataa he
 Storms arise in TV channels
 media or samaaj ke liye udaipur kii ghatana ko bhula dena kya itnaa sahaj ho saktaa he
 Should not citizens of any political identity equipped with constitutional obligations become cautious from this picture
 ham udaipur police ke aiji kaa bayaan dikhaanaa chaahate hai jo unhone ghatana ke din media se baat karte hue kaha tha
 The condition is that some people on the tweet also started criticizing Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as to why they allowed the protesters to act
 aise tarkon ko bhi jagah mil rahi he or aae din log aisi ghatnaon se sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 Many people also condemned the incident
 is ghatana ko bhavukta yaa aakrosh se mat dekhiye, thande dimag se dekhie or sochie ki kahin hamane samvaad ke saare maukey kho to nahin diye hai
 Can anyone get angry about religious reasons to such an extent that they get closer to the court building
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne prashanth bhushan se baat kii, vahi aise maamalon main sabase pehle bolne kaa jokhim bhi uthaate hai
 Many times there is a conflict between Hindus and Muslims
 aisi sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar bheed kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use haank kar court kii taraf le janaa chahie, kya karnaa chahie tha, is par aap hi vichaar karen
 How is any such crowd that is not afraid of court and law changing our society
 samvidhanik sansthaaon ke prati hamaare nazariye ko kaise badalati he sabko samajhnaa chahie
 i was in Goa on Saturday
 vahaan ek diwaar par ek poster dekha
 This poster is of Hindu Jan Jagriti Samiti
 is poster main raashtra dhvaj ke sammaan kii baaten likhi hai
 It has been said that do not use plastic flag, do not make the shape of the national flag on the face and body
 kahin par raashtra dhvaj padaa mili to use sammaan ke saath shaskeey karyaalay main jamaa kiijie, lekin udaipur ke ye noujvaan kisi agyaat hindu sanghathan ke naam par jamaa hokar adaalat parisar tak aa gaye or chat par ram pataakaa laharaa diya
 Would it be an honor for the national flag to do so for the Hindu Jagran Samiti? The view of two types of Hindu organizations before us, you decide
 hamaare sahyogi susheel kumaar mahapatra ne ritred justise sodhi se baatcheet kii
 He said that the judiciary cannot run like this
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne rajyasabha sadsy or vakil keties tulsi se bhi baat kii
 We also called the Advocate General of Rajasthan but did not talk
 ummid he desh ke kanoon mantri yaa supreme court ke chif justise is ghatana kaa sangyaan lenge
 What kind of sounds are coming
 madhyapradesh ke guna se bijepi ke vidhayak panna laal shakya bhaashan de rahe hai ki viraat kohli or anoushka sharma ne desh ke baahar jaakar kyon shaadi kii
 The MLA is saying that Ram is married in this country, Krishna is married, Yudhishthira is married, you are also married, but both of them married abroad
 paisa yahaan se kamaaya or rupaya le gaya videsh main
 After all, where is this thinking coming from? baat baat main dharm kaa virdohi qaraar diya janaa, baat baat main desh kaa virdohi karaara diya janaa
 The poster of Prime Minister Modi was visible on the platform from which MLA was giving speech
 ek or tasviir ai in dinon
 The comments shanivaar ko jodhpur jail se adaalat main peshi ke liye aae asaram baapu ke paanv ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish esen bhargav ne jaakar chhu liya
 Normally, the police prevent a prisoner from getting close, but Justice Bhargava touched his feet
 kya hoicourt ke ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish ko aisa karnaa chahie tha, kya nyaay ke prati logon main acha sandesh jayega
 Justice Bhargava has also been the Governor of Sikkim
 kya hamane galat ko galat kehane kaa saahas kho diya he yaa ab bahut se log aisi ghatnaon se sahamat hone lage hai, jisamen media bhi shaamil he
 One view may be that these young people should be treated harshly, it should be, but my point of view is different
 muslim sabha or udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar par bhagava fahraane vaale sabhi naujavaanon se kisi ko baat karnaa chahie
 Are they upset about not getting a job, how do they get so angry about religion, farmers commit suicide, why don't they get angry about their compassion or system
 hamen inase aankh milakar baat to kerani hogi, poochna to hoga ki jaanboojh kar ye apni zindagi or dusron kii zindagi daanv par kyon laga rahe hai, kya kisi bade sanghathan ne inase kuch vaada kiya he, koi inhen bachaa lene kaa bharosa de rahaa he, kya baat he
 You will know only by talking
 rajasthan ke udaipur kii adaalat ke get kii chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj lahraane kii yah tasviir samvidhan kii banaai tamaam maryaada se khilwaad karti he
 When you see the national flag waving at the dome of the Supreme Court, there is awe that this institution is committed to justice for all in the shadow of the national flag
 kya aap yah sahan kar sakenge ki koi supreme court ke upar tirange ke alaava koi or dhvaj fahraa de, kya aap yah bhi bardaasht kar sakenge ki adaalat kii kaarywahi ko prabhavit karne ke liye baahar badi sankhya main log narebaazi karne ja rahe ho
 We stop at the door of justice, keep an eye on him that the decision will come and the rule will be based on the law and the evidence
 pichley teen saal ke dauraan tirange ke lekar kitni bahes hui

 baad main sabhi ko zamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 If a wrong picture of the tricolor is seen, then the Twitter world becomes active
 tivi channelon main tufaan khadaa ho jaataa he
 Can it be so easy for the media and society to forget the Udaipur incident
 sanvaidhanik daayityon se las kisi bhi raajnneetik pahchaan ke nagarikon ko kya is tasviir se satark nahin ho janaa chahie
 We want to show the statement of the IG of Udaipur police which he said while talking to the media on the day of the incident
 haalat yah he ki twit par kuch log mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii bhi aalochana karne lage ki unhone pradarshnakariyon par karrwai kyon hone di
 Such arguments are also getting place and people are getting comfortable with such incidents
 kai logon ne is ghatana kii ninda bhi kii
 Do not look at this incident with sentiment or anger, look at it with a cool head and think if we have lost all the opportunities for dialogue
 kya dharmik vajahon ko lekar koi is had tak ugr ho saktaa he ki adaalat kii imaarat ke kareeb pahunch jaae
 Our colleague Munne Bharti spoke to Prashant Bhushan, he also risks speaking first in such cases
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich kai baar takaraav kii naubat aati he
 Taking advantage of such a situation, the crowd should be built, it should be taken to the court, what should have been done, you should consider it
 aisi kisi bhi bheed jise adaalat or kanoon kaa khoff na ho, hamaare samaaj ko kaise badal rahi he
 Everyone should understand how our attitude towards constitutional institutions changes
 main shanivaar ko goa main tha
 Saw a poster on a wall there
 yah poster hindu jan jagriti samiti kaa he
 This poster has written about the honor of the national flag
 kaha gaya he ki plastic ke dhvaj kaa istamaal na karen, chehre or sharir par raashtra dhvaj kii akruti na banaaen
 If found the national flag somewhere, submit it with respect to the government office, but these young men of Udaipur gathered in the name of some unknown Hindu organization and came to the court premises and waved Ram flag on the roof
 kya hindu jaagran samiti ke lihaaz se aisa karnaa raashtra dhvaj kaa sammaan hoga? hamaare saamne do tarah ke hindu sanghathanon kaa nazariyaa, faisla aap kiijie
 Our colleague Sushil Kumar Mohapatra spoke to retired Justice Sodhi
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika is tarah se nahin chal sakati he
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra also spoke to Rajya Sabha member and lawyer KTS Tulsi
 hamane rajasthan ke mahadhivaktaa ko bhi phone kiya magar baat nahin hui
 It is expected that the Law Minister of the country or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will take cognizance of this incident
 kisi kisi awaazen aa rahi hai
 BJP MLA from Madhya Pradesh's Guna Panna Lal Shakya is giving a speech on why Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma got married outside the country
 vidhayak ji kah rahe hai ki is desh main ram kaa vivaah hua he, krishna kaa hua he, yudhisthir kaa hua he, aap logon kaa bhi hua he, magar donon ne videsh main shaadi kii
 Earned money from here and took money abroad
 aakhir ye soch kahaan se aa rahi he
 Talking about being said to be anti-religion, in talking vidhayak ji jis manch se bhaashan de rahe the, us par pradhanmantri modi kaa hi poster nazar aa rahaa tha
 Another picture came these days
 tippaniyan On Saturday, a former Chief Justice SN Bhargava touched the feet of Asaram Bapu, who appeared in court from Jodhpur jail
 aam taur par police kisi kaidi ke kareeb jane se rokatii he magar justise bhargav ne unke paanv chhu liye
 Should a former Chief Justice of the High Court have done this, will a good message go to the people towards justice
 justise bhargav sikkim ke rajyapal bhi rah chuke hai
 Have we lost the courage to call the wrong wrong or now many people have started agreeing to such incidents, including the media
 ek nazariyaa yah ho saktaa he ki in naujavaanon se sakhti se pesh aayaa jaae, yah hona chahie magar meraa nazariyaa kuch or bhi he
 Someone should talk to all the youth who hoist saffron at the entrance of Muslim Sabha and Udaipur court
 kya ve naukari na milane se pareshaan hai, unke bheetar dharm ko lekar itnaa gussa kaise aa jaataa he, kisaan aatmahatya karte hai, use lekar unke bheetar karuna yaa system ke prati gussa kyon nahin aata he
 We have to talk to them with an eye, and ask why they are deliberately putting their lives and the lives of others at stake, has any big organization promised them something, someone is promising to save them, What is the matter
 baat karne se hi pataa chalegaa
 During the last three years, there was so much debate about the tricolor
 uniwarsity main chaatro ne loktantric juluus nikaale to kaha gaya ki unamem rashtrawaad kii kami he, isliye vahaan 207 kii oonchai par tirangaa fahraaya jayega
 Check the newspapers and website of 19 February 2016
 tab kii maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ke saath sabhi kendriya vishvavidhyalayon ke vaais chancelaron kii baithak hui
 It was decided that all the central universities would put up the national flag
 sabase pehle jeenyu main tirangaa lehregaa, jabaki vahaan pehle se hi tirangaa laharaata rahaa he
 It was published in the newspapers that this decision has been taken to instill a sense of unity and harmony among the students of higher education institutions and this move will send the message of a strong India
 is faisle ke sandarbh main rajasthan ke udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lahraane kii ghatana ko dekha janaa chahie
 Is there less of a sense of unity and harmony among these people, is there less of a sense of respect for the national flag, who climbed the roof and hoisted the flag of their organization
 14 disambar ke din yah noujvaan udaipur kii adaalat kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lekar chadh gaya
 a crowd of his supporters stood below
 dhvaj par jayshri ram or ram ji kii tasviir he
 This youngster has not been identified yet
 ye log kis sanghathan se jude hai, isaki bhi pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 Our colleague Sanjay Vyas says that most of the protesters were from outside the city
 14 disambar ko police or inke bich kai baar jhadap hui
 The number of times the police removed them, these people used to gather elsewhere
 shaam hote hote udaipur adaalat parisar ke baahar jamaa ho gaye or vahaan bhi maahaul ugr ho gaya
 Then some youngsters climbed onto the roof of the court complex and waved the saffron flag
 sochie, na sanghathan kaa pataa na pahchaan kaa pataa he or adaalat main itane log aa bhi jate hai or uski chat par dhwaja bhi laharaa dete hai
 Had the police not acted promptly on that day, the atmosphere could have worsened
 aapane kuch din pehle ek video dekha hoga, jisamen shambhulaal raigar bengal se aae mazdoor afaraazul kii hatya karata he or jala kar maar detaa he or phir video bhi banaata he
 Shambhulal was a resident of Rajsamand which is 70 km from Udaipur
 rajsamand main alag zila adaalat he
 Those who had gathered in Udaipur were demanding action against the members of the Muslim assembly
 muslim sabha kaa koi video viral hua tha, jisamen aapattijanak naare lagaae ja rahe the
 Police arrested 10 people in connection with the viral video, four are still in jail and six have been given bail
 police ko inase bhi sakhti se pesh aana chahie or poocha janaa chahie ki aise naaron ko lagaakar wo kiskaa bhala kar rahe hai
 Are they deliberately setting fire to a counter-attack
 afrajul kii hatya hui he, sharmnaak he, mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bhi kaha he ki ghatana sharmnaak he or police ne giraftaar main deree nahin kii he, lekin majamaa lagaakar aise naare lagane kii himmat kahaan se ai
 Police should also keep a constant watch on such people
 sawaal he ki agar hindu sanghathan kii maang sahi bhi thi to bhi kya yah sahi tha ki ve pradarshan karte hue adaalat tak aate or chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj laharaa dete
 Had no respect for the Constitution left in the minds of these youths
 ganimat he ki pradarshnakariyon ne us jagah ko nahin chhedaa jahaan vaaki tirangaa laharaa rahaa hota he
 Even today, the tricolor is still safe in the court premises of Udaipur
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ji bhi udaipur se hi aate hai
 Should the government not take special caution about this incident? agar isi tarah bheed apni takat dharmik pahchaan se hasil karti rahi to halaat kya ho sakate hai
 Can we say with the claim that such an event is final
 kya ham kabhi soch sakate the ki aisi tasviir dekhne ko milegi, adaalat kaa parisar hoga, baahar bheed hogi or chat par koi bhagava liye khadaa hoga
 Police had detained 200 people that day in connection with the Udaipur incident
 kai aise bhi the jo apane adalati kaam se vahaan gaye the
 All were later released on bail
 tirangaa kii ek galat tasviir dikh jaati he to twitor jagat sakriy ho jaataa he
 Storms arise in TV channels
 media or samaaj ke liye udaipur kii ghatana ko bhula dena kya itnaa sahaj ho saktaa he
 Should not citizens of any political identity equipped with constitutional obligations become cautious from this picture
 ham udaipur police ke aiji kaa bayaan dikhaanaa chaahate hai jo unhone ghatana ke din media se baat karte hue kaha tha
 The condition is that some people on the tweet also started criticizing Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as to why they allowed the protesters to act
 aise tarkon ko bhi jagah mil rahi he or aae din log aisi ghatnaon se sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 Many people also condemned the incident
 is ghatana ko bhavukta yaa aakrosh se mat dekhiye, thande dimag se dekhie or sochie ki kahin hamane samvaad ke saare maukey kho to nahin diye hai
 Can anyone get angry about religious reasons to such an extent that they get closer to the court building
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne prashanth bhushan se baat kii, vahi aise maamalon main sabase pehle bolne kaa jokhim bhi uthaate hai
 Many times there is a conflict between Hindus and Muslims
 aisi sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar bheed kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use haank kar court kii taraf le janaa chahie, kya karnaa chahie tha, is par aap hi vichaar karen
 How is any such crowd that is not afraid of court and law changing our society
 samvidhanik sansthaaon ke prati hamaare nazariye ko kaise badalati he sabko samajhnaa chahie
 i was in Goa on Saturday
 vahaan ek diwaar par ek poster dekha
 This poster is of Hindu Jan Jagriti Samiti
 is poster main raashtra dhvaj ke sammaan kii baaten likhi hai
 It has been said that do not use plastic flag, do not make the shape of the national flag on the face and body
 kahin par raashtra dhvaj padaa mili to use sammaan ke saath shaskeey karyaalay main jamaa kiijie, lekin udaipur ke ye noujvaan kisi agyaat hindu sanghathan ke naam par jamaa hokar adaalat parisar tak aa gaye or chat par ram pataakaa laharaa diya
 Would it be an honor for the national flag to do so for the Hindu Jagran Samiti? The view of two types of Hindu organizations before us, you decide
 hamaare sahyogi susheel kumaar mahapatra ne ritred justise sodhi se baatcheet kii
 He said that the judiciary cannot run like this
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne rajyasabha sadsy or vakil keties tulsi se bhi baat kii
 We also called the Advocate General of Rajasthan but did not talk
 ummid he desh ke kanoon mantri yaa supreme court ke chif justise is ghatana kaa sangyaan lenge
 What kind of sounds are coming
 madhyapradesh ke guna se bijepi ke vidhayak panna laal shakya bhaashan de rahe hai ki viraat kohli or anoushka sharma ne desh ke baahar jaakar kyon shaadi kii
 The MLA is saying that Ram is married in this country, Krishna is married, Yudhishthira is married, you are also married, but both of them married abroad
 paisa yahaan se kamaaya or rupaya le gaya videsh main
 After all, where is this thinking coming from? baat baat main dharm kaa virdohi qaraar diya janaa, baat baat main desh kaa virdohi karaara diya janaa
 The poster of Prime Minister Modi was visible on the platform from which MLA was giving speech
 ek or tasviir ai in dinon
 The comments shanivaar ko jodhpur jail se adaalat main peshi ke liye aae asaram baapu ke paanv ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish esen bhargav ne jaakar chhu liya
 Normally, the police prevent a prisoner from getting close, but Justice Bhargava touched his feet
 kya hoicourt ke ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish ko aisa karnaa chahie tha, kya nyaay ke prati logon main acha sandesh jayega
 Justice Bhargava has also been the Governor of Sikkim
 kya hamane galat ko galat kehane kaa saahas kho diya he yaa ab bahut se log aisi ghatnaon se sahamat hone lage hai, jisamen media bhi shaamil he
 One view may be that these young people should be treated harshly, it should be, but my point of view is different
 muslim sabha or udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar par bhagava fahraane vaale sabhi naujavaanon se kisi ko baat karnaa chahie
 Are they upset about not getting a job, how do they get so angry about religion, farmers commit suicide, why don't they get angry about their compassion or system
 hamen inase aankh milakar baat to kerani hogi, poochna to hoga ki jaanboojh kar ye apni zindagi or dusron kii zindagi daanv par kyon laga rahe hai, kya kisi bade sanghathan ne inase kuch vaada kiya he, koi inhen bachaa lene kaa bharosa de rahaa he, kya baat he
 You will know only by talking

 hamaare sahyogi sanjay vyas kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar pradarshnkaree shahar se baahar ke the
 On December 14, there were several clashes between the police and them
 police jitani baar inhen hataati, ye log duusari jagah jamaa ho jate the
 By evening, Udaipur had gathered outside the court premises and the atmosphere there became fierce
 tabhi kuch noujvaan adaalat parisar kii chat par chadh gaye or bhagava dhvaj laharaa diya
 Think, neither the address of the organization nor the address of identity and so many people come to the court and hoist the flag on its roof
 police ne usadin tatparta se karrwai na kii hoti to maahaul or karaab ho saktaa tha
 You must have seen a video a few days ago, in which Shambhulal Rager murders and burns Afrazul, a laborer from Bengal and then also makes the video
 shambhulaal rajsamand kaa rahane vaala tha jo udaipur se 70 kimi he
 Rajsamand has a separate district court
 udaipur main jo log jamaa hue the wo muslim sabha ke sadasyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahe the
 Offensive slogans were being raised in which a video of the Muslim gathering went viral
 police ne viral hue video ke maamle main 10 logon ko giraftaar kiya tha, chaar abhi jail main he or chah kii zamaanat ho gai he
 The police should also treat them strictly and should be asked who they are doing well by raising such slogans
 kya wo kisi javaabi bheed ke liye jaanboojh kar aag laga rahe hai
 Afrajul has been murdered, shameful, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also said that the incident is shameful and the police have not delayed the arrest, but where did the courage to raise such slogans by raising a magma
 aise logon par bhi police ko lagaataar nazar rakhni chahie
 The question is that even if the demand of the Hindu organization was true, was it right that they would come to the court in protest and climb the roof and wave the saffron flag
 kya in yuvaaon ke man main samvidhan ke prati koi sammaan nahin bachaa tha
 It is a matter of honor that the protesters did not touch the place where the tricolor is actually flying
 aaj bhi udaipur kii adaalat parisar main aaj bhi tirangaa mahfuz he
 Home Minister of Rajasthan Gulabchand Kataria also comes from Udaipur
 kya sarkaar ko is ghatana ko lekar vishesh satarkta nahin baratani chahie
 If the crowd continues to gain its strength through religious identity, what can be the situation? kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki is tarah kii ghatana antim he
 Could we ever imagine that such a picture would be seen, there would be a court complex, there would be a crowd outside and someone would stand with a saffron on the roof
 police ne udaipur kii ghatana ke maamle main us din 200 logon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 There were many who went there for their court work
 baad main sabhi ko zamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 If a wrong picture of the tricolor is seen, then the Twitter world becomes active
 tivi channelon main tufaan khadaa ho jaataa he
 Can it be so easy for the media and society to forget the Udaipur incident
 sanvaidhanik daayityon se las kisi bhi raajnneetik pahchaan ke nagarikon ko kya is tasviir se satark nahin ho janaa chahie
 We want to show the statement of the IG of Udaipur police which he said while talking to the media on the day of the incident
 haalat yah he ki twit par kuch log mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii bhi aalochana karne lage ki unhone pradarshnakariyon par karrwai kyon hone di
 Such arguments are also getting place and people are getting comfortable with such incidents
 kai logon ne is ghatana kii ninda bhi kii
 Do not look at this incident with sentiment or anger, look at it with a cool head and think if we have lost all the opportunities for dialogue
 kya dharmik vajahon ko lekar koi is had tak ugr ho saktaa he ki adaalat kii imaarat ke kareeb pahunch jaae
 Our colleague Munne Bharti spoke to Prashant Bhushan, he also risks speaking first in such cases
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich kai baar takaraav kii naubat aati he
 Taking advantage of such a situation, the crowd should be built, it should be taken to the court, what should have been done, you should consider it
 aisi kisi bhi bheed jise adaalat or kanoon kaa khoff na ho, hamaare samaaj ko kaise badal rahi he

 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra also spoke to Rajya Sabha member and lawyer KTS Tulsi
 hamane rajasthan ke mahadhivaktaa ko bhi phone kiya magar baat nahin hui
 It is expected that the Law Minister of the country or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will take cognizance of this incident
 kisi kisi awaazen aa rahi hai

 tippaniyan On Saturday, a former Chief Justice SN Bhargava touched the feet of Asaram Bapu, who appeared in court from Jodhpur jail
 aam taur par police kisi kaidi ke kareeb jane se rokatii he magar justise bhargav ne unke paanv chhu liye

 Afrajul has been murdered, shameful, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also said that the incident is shameful and the police have not delayed the arrest, but where did the courage to raise such slogans by raising a magma
 aise logon par bhi police ko lagaataar nazar rakhni chahie
 The question is that even if the demand of the Hindu organization was true, was it right that they would come to the court in protest and climb the roof and wave the saffron flag
 kya in yuvaaon ke man main samvidhan ke prati koi sammaan nahin bachaa tha
 It is a matter of honor that the protesters did not touch the place where the tricolor is actually flying
 aaj bhi udaipur kii adaalat parisar main aaj bhi tirangaa mahfuz he
 Home Minister of Rajasthan Gulabchand Kataria also comes from Udaipur
 kya sarkaar ko is ghatana ko lekar vishesh satarkta nahin baratani chahie
 If the crowd continues to gain its strength through religious identity, what can be the situation? kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki is tarah kii ghatana antim he
 Could we ever imagine that a picture would be seen, there would be a court complex, there would be a crowd outside and someone would stand with saffron on the roof
 police ne udaipur kii ghatana ke maamle main us din 200 logon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 There were many who went there for their court work
 baad main sabhi ko zamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 If a wrong picture of the tricolor is seen, then the Twitter world becomes active
 tivi channelon main tufaan khadaa ho jaataa he
 Can it be so easy for the media and society to forget the Udaipur incident
 sanvaidhanik daayityon se las kisi bhi raajnneetik pahchaan ke nagarikon ko kya is tasviir se satark nahin ho janaa chahie
 We want to show the statement of the IG of Udaipur police which he said while talking to the media on the day of the incident
 haalat yah he ki twit par kuch log mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii bhi aalochana karne lage ki unhone pradarshnakariyon par karrwai kyon hone di
 Such arguments are also getting place and people are getting comfortable with such incidents
 kai logon ne is ghatana kii ninda bhi kii
 Do not look at this incident with sentiment or anger, look at it with a cool head and think if we have lost all the opportunities for dialogue
 kya dharmik vajahon ko lekar koi is had tak ugr ho saktaa he ki adaalat kii imaarat ke kareeb pahunch jaae
 Our colleague Munne Bharti spoke to Prashant Bhushan, he also risks speaking first in such cases
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich kai baar takaraav kii naubat aati he
 Taking advantage of such a situation, the crowd should be built, it should be taken to the court, what should have been done, you should consider it
 aisi kisi bhi bheed jise adaalat or kanoon kaa khoff na ho, hamaare samaaj ko kaise badal rahi he
 Everyone should understand how our attitude towards constitutional institutions changes
 main shanivaar ko goa main tha
 Saw a poster on a wall there
 yah poster hindu jan jagriti samiti kaa he
 This poster has written about the honor of the national flag
 kaha gaya he ki plastic ke dhvaj kaa istamaal na karen, chehre or sharir par raashtra dhvaj kii akruti na banaaen
 If found the national flag somewhere, submit it with respect to the government office, but these young men of Udaipur gathered in the name of some unknown Hindu organization and came to the court premises and waved Ram flag on the roof
 kya hindu jaagran samiti ke lihaaz se aisa karnaa raashtra dhvaj kaa sammaan hoga? hamaare saamne do tarah ke hindu sanghathanon kaa nazariyaa, faisla aap kiijie
 Our colleague Sushil Kumar Mohapatra spoke to retired Justice Sodhi
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika is tarah se nahin chal sakati he
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra also spoke to Rajya Sabha member and lawyer KTS Tulsi
 hamane rajasthan ke mahadhivaktaa ko bhi phone kiya magar baat nahin hui
 It is expected that the Law Minister of the country or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will take cognizance of this incident

 Police had detained 200 people that day in connection with the Udaipur incident
 kai aise bhi the jo apane adalati kaam se vahaan gaye the
 All were later released on bail
 tirangaa kii ek galat tasviir dikh jaati he to twitor jagat sakriy ho jaataa he
 Storms arise in TV channels
 media or samaaj ke liye udaipur kii ghatana ko bhula dena kya itnaa sahaj ho saktaa he
 Should not citizens of any political identity equipped with constitutional obligations become cautious from this picture
 ham udaipur police ke aiji kaa bayaan dikhaanaa chaahate hai jo unhone ghatana ke din media se baat karte hue kaha tha
 The condition is that some people on the tweet also started criticizing Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as to why they allowed the protesters to act
 aise tarkon ko bhi jagah mil rahi he or aae din log aisi ghatnaon se sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 Many people also condemned the incident
 is ghatana ko bhavukta yaa aakrosh se mat dekhiye, thande dimag se dekhie or sochie ki kahin hamane samvaad ke saare maukey kho to nahin diye hai
 Can anyone get angry about religious reasons to such an extent that they get closer to the court building
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne prashanth bhushan se baat kii, vahi aise maamalon main sabase pehle bolne kaa jokhim bhi uthaate hai
 Many times there is a conflict between Hindus and Muslims
 aisi sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar bheed kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use haank kar court kii taraf le janaa chahie, kya karnaa chahie tha, is par aap hi vichaar karen
 How is any such crowd that is not afraid of court and law changing our society
 samvidhanik sansthaaon ke prati hamaare nazariye ko kaise badalati he sabko samajhnaa chahie
 i was in Goa on Saturday
 vahaan ek diwaar par ek poster dekha
 This poster is of Hindu Jan Jagriti Samiti
 is poster main raashtra dhvaj ke sammaan kii baaten likhi hai
 It has been said that do not use plastic flag, do not make the shape of the national flag on the face and body
 kahin par raashtra dhvaj padaa mili to use sammaan ke saath shaskeey karyaalay main jamaa kiijie, lekin udaipur ke ye noujvaan kisi agyaat hindu sanghathan ke naam par jamaa hokar adaalat parisar tak aa gaye or chat par ram pataakaa laharaa diya
 Would it be an honor for the national flag to do so for the Hindu Jagran Samiti? The view of two types of Hindu organizations before us, you decide
 hamaare sahyogi susheel kumaar mahapatra ne ritred justise sodhi se baatcheet kii
 He said that the judiciary cannot run like this
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne rajyasabha sadsy or vakil keties tulsi se bhi baat kii
 We also called the Advocate General of Rajasthan but did not talk

 What kind of sounds are coming

 The MLA is saying that Ram is married in this country, Krishna is married, Yudhishthira is married, you are also married, but both of them married abroad
 paisa yahaan se kamaaya or rupaya le gaya videsh main
 After all, where is this thinking coming from? baat baat main dharm kaa virdohi qaraar diya janaa, baat baat main desh kaa virdohi karaara diya janaa

 The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in the assembly election results
 haalanki sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri jaadui number se thik pehle bijepi kaa vijay rath ruk gaya
 Congress came in second and JDS in third place
 aise main rajya main saaf taur par trishanku vidhansabha kii tasviir saamne ai he
 However, Congress and JDS have joined hands to keep BJP away from power
 congress ne bada daanv khelte hue jedies ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya he
 The JDS has made a claim to form the government with the support of Congress to Governor Vajubhai Vala
 idhar bijepi bhi rajyapal ke paas pahunch gai he
 BS Yeddyurappa has sought 48 hours from the Governor to prove his majority
 khabaron ke mutabik rajyapal ne yediurppa ko 17 may kaa samay diya he
 According to the results reached by 9 pm, BJP has emerged as the largest party out of 222 with 104 seats
 duusare number par 78 siton ke saath congress he, jabaki jedies 37 siten jeetne main safal hui he
 Earlier in the evening, after Yeddyurappa, JDS leader Kumaraswamy arrived to meet the Governor
 unke saport main congress netaa siddharmaiya bhi rajbhavan pahunche the
 The two held a joint press conference after meeting the governor and claimed to form the government
 chunaav parinaam ke baad shaam ko siddharmaiya istipha dene rajyapal bhawan apane saathi netaaon ke saath pahunche
 Congress leader Dinesh Gundu Rao met Deve Gowda and handed him a letter of support
 iske alaava samarthan kaa ek patr rajyapal ko bhi saunpa gaya he
 Here Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke to senior JD (S) leader HD Deve Gowda over the phone
 saath hi bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi devgauda ko phone kar badhai di or kaha ki ummid he ki jedies congress ke saath milakar rajya main sarkaar banaaegi
 5 JDS mlas are in touch with BJP, according to the 5 JDS mlas of BJP
 bijepi alaakaman ko ummid he ki sabase badi party ke naate rajyapal bijepi ko hi sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karenge
 The governor may give Yeddyurappa an oath of 17 May
 sutron ke mutabik do siton par chunaav jite kumaraswami par bijepi ek seat se jaldi-jaldi istipha dene kaa dabaav banaaegi
 At the same time, the Governor will also put the matter before Kumaraswamy to resign from one of the two seats won before the trust vote
 aise main yah bhi jaankaree nikalakar aa rahi he ki jedies apane vidhayakon ko ekajute rakhane ke liye bengalooru ke baahar bhi le ja sakati he
 According to sources, the Lingayat mlas of the Congress are also in touch with the BJP
 agar congress kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye samarthan karti hai, to congress ke lingayat vidhayak vishwaas mat par gaiyrhaazir rah sakate hai
 There is also a ban on behalf of the BJP, although the BJP will not allow Karnataka to get out of its hands easily
 bhaajapa kii ore se bhi rajya main morchebandi shuru kar di gai he
 Many strong leaders are already present in the state and leaders like Dharmendra Pradhan, JP Nadda, Prakash Javadekar have also reached Bangalore
 karnataka kaa chunaav darasal donon partiyon ke liye pratishtha kaa prashn ban gaya he
 Looking at the trends and results so far, one does not seem to get a clear majority
 aisa lag rahaa he ki jedies kii madad ke bina koi bhi sarkaar banane kii sthiti main philhal nahin he
 Even though the BJP seemed to be immersed in celebration till some time ago, now the focus of both parties is on the efforts to form a government and till then the scope of celebration seems to be subsiding
 janadesh par daanvmangalavaar kii dopaher siddharmaiya ke saath baahar se aae congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki hamaari phone par devgauda or kumaraswami ke saath baat hui he or unhone saidhantik samarthan par sahmati jataai he
 The JD (S) will lead the government and the two parties will meet the Governor together
 siddharmaiya ne kaha ki ham jedies ko baahar se samarthan denge
 Please tell that DK Shivakumar, who was the Minister of Energy in the Siddaramaiah Government, H
K
 nagesh ko samarthan kiya he, jiske baad nagesh congress ko samarthan dene ko taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Earlier, to stop the BJP, former Congress president Sonia Gandhi spoke to Ghulam Nabi Azad who was in Karnataka and asked Deve Gowda to make Janata Dal (S) leader Kumar Swamy the chief minister
 dilli se sanket aate hi bengalooru sthit mukhyamantri awaas ek tarah se war room main badal gaya
 The Congress opened all its doors for talks with the JDS
 party kii koshish jedy(es) ko yah bataane kii thi ki congress uske liye kisi bhi paristhiti main ek behatar vikalp hogi
 JDS seems to be standing on the third position in the state assembly elections, but now it is also in a position to become king from the kingmaker
 kumaraswami ke liye congress ke saath jaakar khud mukhyamantri bananaa or sarkaar bananaa zyada phaayde kaa sauda hoga
 In such a situation, we are seeing possibilities for ourselves for 2019 as well
 tazaa rujhaan or nattijeybta den ki bijepi ko 104 siton par badhat he
 On the other hand, Congress has an edge over 78 seats
 chunaav kii teesri pramukh party jedy(es) ko bhi 38 siton par badhat hasil he
 According to the data released by the Election Commission, till 9:30 pm, BJP has won 103 seats
 vahiin congress ko 78 siton par vijay mili he
 Apart from this, JD (S) has won 37 seats and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Karnataka Prajnayavantha Janata Party (KPJP) have won 1-1 seats
 224 siton vaali rajya vidhansabha kii 222 siton par pade maton kii ginati mangalvaar subah 8 baje se shuru hui thi
 The most interesting thing about the ego of the Congress is that so far according to the data released by the Election Commission, the Congress party has got more votes than the Bharatiya Janata Party
 lekin donon partiyon ke bich 20 siton se zyada kaa antar najar aa rahaa he
 After the rise of JDS, political experts have now started saying that Congress has taken its ego
 agar congress party jedies or basapa jaise dalon ke saath milakar chunaav ladi hoti to shaayad janadesh kii tasviir bilkul alag hoti or bhaajapa vahaan dikhaai de rahi hoti jahaan ab congress khadi hone ko majaboor he
 The decision to contest the elections alone in Karnataka was overshadowed by the Congress
 saath hi isse kendriya str par ek sangathit vipaksh kaa morcha banane kii koshishon ko bhi dhakka laga he
 Other opposition parties will no longer miss out on the issue
 kuch ahm nateezeybatak ke nateezon main mukhyamantri siddharmaiya chamundeshwari vidhansabha seat se haar gaye hai, jabaki badami seat par unhone 1600 voton ke saath jeet hasil kii he
 While Kumaraswamy of the Janata Dal (S) has won both of his seats, Deve Gowda's second son HD Ramanna has also emerged victorious

 Politics is also a wonderful thing, it removes the clothes of the elders and sells the clothes of the elders, the Prime Minister's blue suit was auctioned, watching the Prime Minister's worn suit was a different experience, it is talked into crores Otherwise, instead of clothes worn by us, only one barni and two glass bowls come

 Considering reading an amount like 31 crores, there seems to be doubt
 31 ke baad laga he yaa 4 ke baad
 Prime Minister's suit was auctioned in the discussion, Yuvraj Singh was auctioned without discussion, Yuvraj's father came into the discussion despite being auctioned, Sangakkara neither came in the discussion nor could it be auctioned, then the sadness of not being auctioned And when you want to get suit, get the price

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had adopted Jagdishpur village of Amethi under the 'saansad Adarsh gram Yojana' and today, after five years, the villagers here say that they are waiting for the arrival of the Congress president and the development work begins
 rahul gandhi pichhali baar disambar 2014 main jagadishpur aaye the tab unhone gaanv ko god liya tha
 Kesari Nandan, who lives in the village, said, 'rahul Gandhi only came once in 2014
 us samay har ped, khambha or sadak maape gayi the maano vikaas kaary honge
 But nothing happened since
 ' saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat sansad sadasyon ko apane sansadeey kshetra main ek gaanv god lekar uskaa adarsh gram kii tarah vikaas karnaa tha

 unhone kaha, ‘jab rahul gandhi ne 2014 main amethi se jeetne ke baad bhi apane god liye gaanv ko chhod diya tab smriti irani hamaare paas aati raheen
 When Rahul Gandhi's margin of victory narrowed last time, it was a warning to him but it is clear that he paid no attention to it
 ' The villagers said that they have benefited from programs like bjp's Ujjwala scheme
 haalanki congress kii amethi ikai ke adhyaksh yogendra mishra ne rahul gandhi ke bachaav main aate hue kaha ki sarkaar ne saansad adarsh gram yojana ke liye alag se dhan nahin diya tha
