 One bullet hit Rohit's head and another in his stomach
 rohit vahiin gir padaa
 Soon after, Harish escaped from the scene
 police kii tafteeshmen pataa laga he ki marane vaala rohit teen saal pehle tak aaropee ravi or harish saath kaam karata tha
 Their work was of looting and looting
 in par do se zyada maamle bhi darj hai, lekin do saal pehle ravi ne in sabakaa saath chhod diya or usne apana finance kaa kaam shuru kar diya
 According to the police, Ravi had improved now and he had forgotten his past as well, but the police did not have an answer as to why he walked with an illegal pistol when Ravi got reformed
 police ab ye pataa laga rahi he ki ravi ne jis avaidh pistal kaa is katl main istemaal kiya wo usne kahaan se kharidi thi
 In the event of devastation caused by unseasonal rains, hail or any natural havoc, farmers will now get more compensation
 itnaa hi nahin pradhanmantri modi ke elaan ke mutabik ab sarkari muaavje kaa dayera bhi badha diya gaya
 Till now, the government compensation has been given only for 50% of the crop wasted, but now the farmers will be entitled to compensation for 33% of the destruction, along with the compensation amount will be one and a half times
 elaan ke baad muaavje kii rakam bina sinchai vaali fasalon ke liye 4500 ru
 Rs
 6750 per hectare and Rs
 9000 for irrigation crops
 kii jagah 13500 ru
 Per hectare
 aise hi vaarshik fasalon ke liye muaavja 12,000 ru
 18000 from now
 prati hectare hoga
 But the biggest question is about the timely relief to the farmers because on the one hand, where there are disturbances in the local level of loss, on the other hand, compensation from Delhi would go round many ministries till the time it reaches the farmers, it would be too late
 is
 prabhavit kisaanon ko zyaada muaavja dene kaa faisla aise samay par liya gaya he jab desh main lakhon prabhavit fasal barbaad hone ke baad muawza milane kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Now it will be important to see how soon the Center, along with the State Governments, is able to provide relief to the affected farmers

 '' Shatrughan Sinha, who has 'silenced' others in his special style on the screen of cinema, is making a statement by crossing his party's 'lakshman Rekha' these days
 darasal, bihar main vidhansabha chunaav najadik he or shatrughna kii mahatvakanksha kisi se chhipi nahin he
 The question arises whether 'bihari Babu' is a big political leader or he is a victim of 'self-obsession'
 aage sawaalon ke jariye un binduon kii charchaa kii gai, jo shatrughna kii manachaahi kamyaabi kii raah main roda ban sakate hai
 
 
 1
 apane siyaasi kad ko lekar bhram to nahin?shatrughna sinha filmi parde par chaahe jitne kaamyaab rahe hon, par unhen samajhnaa hoga ki siyasat main unka kad abhi itnaa bada nahin hua he ki ve sidhe kendriya netritv se takkar le saken
 His image within the party is becoming negative due to continuous rebellion, which is not good for his political career
 2
 How much influence on the new younger generation? Even if Shatrughan Sinha changes his face and joins another party, he will still be able to do some special charisma, there is a lot of doubt
 votaron kaa bahut bada hissaa us aayu-varg kaa he, jisane filmi parde par shatrughna sinha ke karishme ko mahasoos hi nahin kiya he
 How will the enemy be able to appeal to the younger generation of new thinking? At the same time, changing the party will also affect their image
 3
 Will the fleet cross through the boat? If Shatrughna is understanding that he will cross the party's fleet every time he rides the caste boat, then this can also be his confusion
 jati ke maujuuda sameekaran main unka ganit agar fail ho jaae, to yah koi achraj kii baat nahin hogi
 4
 public ko naaraaz karke 'kranti'?apni hi party ke khilaaf 'kranti' karnaa ek alag baat he, par shatrughna sinha ne haal main kuch aise kadam uthaae hai, jo janata ke bade varg ko shaayad hi raas aae
 When Mumbai got the hanger of blood tears Yakub Memon, Shatrughan did not take long to show 'mercy'
 sansad kii maryaada bhang karke lagaataar shor-sharaaba karne vaale saansadon ko jab spikar ne 5 dinon ke liye baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya, tobihari babu isse 'niraash'ho gaye
 It seems that they are failing to understand the mood of the publication
 5
 Desire for 'mewa' without service? Shatrughan Babu has not yet served BJP as much as anyone deserves a big post
 laalkrishna adwani ji ke tyaag-tapasya or uske fal se ve bhaleebhanti waakif honge

 On the other hand, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that it is necessary to win the hearts of the people of Kashmir who are being killed by both terrorists and security forces
 unhone kaha ki pichley kuch samay main halaat bigade hai
 He claimed that the situation was normal during the previous Congress government, but the situation has worsened during the current government of PDP-BJP

 ) The legacy of Maharashtra's political families is old
 abhi ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar kaa maamla bilkul taaja he
 There are many reports in the media in which there has been talk of political tussle between Pawar's nephew and his daughter
 sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar or unki beti supriya sule maharashtra main janaa pahachaanaa naam hai jin par ensipi kii puri raajnneeti chalati rahi he lekin ab isamen daraar kii shikaayatein hai
 The estrangement between Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar is also seen as an uncle-nephew fight
 haalanki maharashtra kii yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he
 Keep in mind there is an old history of uncle nephew's confrontation in Maharashtra politics
 bal thakare or raaj thakare iske udhaaharan hai
 The second example is given by Dhananjay Munde, nephew of Gopinath Munde
 sharad pavaar or ajit pawarhalia khabaron par gaur karen to kah sakate hai ki sharad pavaar ke parivaar main sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 a political battle broke out in the Pawar family just before the Lok Sabha elections
 khabaron ke mutabik sharad pavaar ke bade bhai aanandarav pavaar ke bete ajit pavaar virodh main utar gaye hai
 Ajit Pawar is considered the successor of Sharad Pawar in the politics of NCP till date
 magar pavaar ne apni beti supriya sule ko aage kar diya he
 Supriya Sule is the MP who contests the Lok Sabha elections from her father's traditional Baramati seat
 yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab ajit pavaar ne ensipi ke andar sharad pavaar ko chunauti di he or apane bete parth pavaar ko loksabhaa chunaav ladaane kaa faisla kiya he
 It is being said that due to this insistence of Ajit Pawar, Sharad Pawar has announced not to contest elections himself
 pehle kii khabaren dekhen to unhone apana siyaasi sanyas chhodte hue maadhaa seat se ladane kaa faisla kiya tha lekin jab ajit pavaar ne bete ko mawal seat se ladaane kaa elaan kiya to sharad pavaar khud peeche hat gaye
 In the same sequence, Ajit Pawar's second brother's son has come out in support of Sharad Pawar
 tabhi ajit pavaar ke bhai ke bete rohit pavaar ne abhi haal main fasebuk post likh kar sharad pavaar se chunaav ladane kaa aagrah kiya he
 Rohit Pawar recalled Sharad Pawar's contribution to Maharashtra's politics and said he should contest elections
 abhi jo sthiti he use dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki aage bhi pavaar parivaar kaa yah siyaasi drama chalegaa
 Pulling into the Thackeray family, people saw not his son Uddhav Thackeray but his nephew Raj Thackeray as the natural heir of late Bal Thackeray, the founding leader of Shiv Sena
 logon ko ummid thi ki thakare shivasena kii kaman raaj thakare ko hi saunpenge lekin aisa nahin hua or shivasena kii kaman uddhav thakare ke haathon main chali gai
 After this Raj Thackeray left Shiv Sena and formed his party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)
 raaj thakare ne jis vakt emenes kaa gathan kiya us vakt bal thakare 80 saal ke ho chuke the
 One of the reasons behind forming the party is that Raj Thackeray's differences with Uddhav deepened at the time (2006) and both came face to face with the Shiv Sena ticket distribution
 raaj thakare ko tab ek tarah se party ke faisle lene main darkinakar kar diya gaya tha
 Those listening to Raj Thackeray are well aware that his speaking style resembles that of Bal Thackeray as he has learned a lot from his uncle
 shivasena se alag hote hue raaj thakare ne yah bhi kaha ki shivasena apni dhar kho chuki he, lihaaja ve isamen nahin bane rahanaa chaahate
 Raj Thackeray's slogan of Hindutva and Marathi manusha also meet Bal Thackeray
 raaj or uddhav thakare ke bich ek haalia badi ghatana ye hui ki manase ke ekmaatr vidhayak ko uddhav thakare kii party shivasena ne tod liya or apane main mila liya
 After this incident, the feud between the two deepened
 munde parivaar kii adaavat puraniensipi ke netaa swa
 The tussle between Gopinath Munde and his nephew Dhananjay Munde is well known
 aapako bataa den ki 2014 main ensipi ne dhananjay munde ko vidhanparishad main virdohi dal kaa netaa banane kaa faisla kiya
 This decision was because by doing this the NCP wanted to use Dhananjay against both Munde's daughters in backward politics
 dhananjay munde ko pehali baar gopinath munde ne hi vidhanparishad bheja tha
 But Dhananjay resigned from the Legislative Council after his separation from his uncle
 iske baad ensipi ne apane cote se unhen vidhanparishad bheja
 Later, the NCP tried to breach the bjp's backward class vote bank by making Dhananjay the leader of opposition
 us vakt maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kii jeet main gopinath munde kii badi beti pankaja munde ne badi bhoomika nibhaai or kai reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 In view of this, NCP made Dhananjay Munde a pawn in front of Pankaja
 aisa kar ensipi ne na sirf marathavada main balki puure maharashtra ke pichde varg main apni pahunch badhaane kii koshish kii
 This work of Dhananjay Munde used to do Chhagan Bhujbal in NCP then
 jaankaron kii maane to pichhadon kii raajnneeti main khud gopinath munde bhi bhujabal ko apana netaa maanate the
 Seeing this, the Pawar family tried to shear Bhujbal by advancing Dhananjay Munde
 apni aane film ‘raajnneeti’ main glamer se dur dikhne vaali baliwood abhinetri katrina caff ne kaha he ki vah kisi bhi film kaa chayan apane vivek ke aadhaar par karti hai
 25-year-old Katrina said, 'I make decisions based on my discretion and see how powerful the script is
 main is varsh ‘raajnneeti’ film ke relies ko lekar kaaphi ashanvit hum kyonki is filmein main mujhe film udyog ke kuch shreshth pratibhaaon ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila he
 Directed by Prakash Jha, the film is based on politics and is releasing on June 4
 haalanki katrina ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki ‘neuyark’ film kii safalataa ne karier ke prati unke najariye ko badla he
 In this film, Katrina has played a serious role opposite her successful comedy films

 Regarding skin care, Katrina says that she is very careful about removing her makeup

 tata samooh ko jearady tata ne mote taur par apni jaadui shakhsiyat se chalaaya, haalanki tata kii kuch companiyon mentata khandaanaki hissedari kaaphi kam thi
 i remember that there was a time when the Birla family's share in Tata Steel was higher (6-7 per cent) than the Tata's five per cent
 iske baavjood har saal ji
 D
 birla salanaa aam baithak se pehle voting ke kagajaat jearady tata ko hi bhejte the
 When Ratan Tata took charge, there were four to five influential satraps in the Tata group, who started making a ruckus by saying that the companies he led were not from the Tata group
 ratan tata ke shuruaati teen-chaar saal behad mushkil bhare the
 He had to deal with these people
 jearady kaa aise maamalon main tarika yah tha ki ve khulkar baat karte the, jabaki ratan antarmukhi the
 These circumstances helped him to understand the importance of ownership and he started trying hard to increase Tata's stake in the companies
 is tarah se unhone is baat kaa pukhta intjaam kiya ki companiyon ke management kaa adhikaar tata ke paas hi rahe
 At parties, JRD loved to meet and talk to all kinds of people and caught everyone's attention
 iske ulat, ratan ko chuninda logon ke saath dinar karnaa pasand tha
 If he used to walk, he would have liked to eat alone
 unhen partiyon main janaa pasand nahin tha
 He had difficulty talking to people or to a large group
 kam logon ke saath ve zyada sahaj rahete the
 However, during the last two decades, he has improved himself a lot in this matter
 chhuttiyon ke dauraan bhi ve tata samooh ke pune sthit lake house par hi jate the jabaki jearady jamshedpur aate or adivasee kalyaan sanghon se lekar aspataal tak tamaam kism ke logon se milte-julate the
 People were desperate to meet him during such migrations
 phir main choti-choti baithken yojit karwaata, jahaan jearady ek baar main 10 se 15 logon ke saath baat kar pate the
 He enjoyed such conversations
 har das minute par main nae samooh ko milwane le aata
 In this way he was able to meet many people
 ratan bhi haalanki kisi se milane main gurej nahin karte the, lekin har baar unhen nai jagah chahie hoti thi
 Both JRD and Ratan were licensed pilots
 pehle yah hota tha ki apane license ko apadet rakhane ke liye unhen jamshedpur aakar apni vimaan udaane kii avadhi ko darj karwaanaa hota tha
 Till then, Tata Steel had two ships, which often brought them to Tatanagar
 ratan ne jamshedpur main jab flying club shuru kiya, tab ve tata steel main junior officer the
 The club became so popular that Russian Modi obtained a license at the age of 50
 log mujhase poochhate the ki maine license kyon nahin liya? jearady ko vimaanan main sabase zyada dilchaspee thi jabaki ratan kii chahat telko yaa tata motors the
 JRD was the head of Air India till the seventies and was his favorite company
 ratan bhi kuch samay ke liye air india ke chairman hue the
 The biggest similarity between the two was that they were very comfortable and grounded
 unhen logon kaa apane peeche bhaagna pasand nahin tha
 Both of them spent most of their lives in a rented house of the company
 mujhe jearady ke saath safar kaa ek vakya yaad he
 i picked up his bag at the airport
 unhone dhire se meri kalai dabaai or kaha, ''jarurat hogi to main tumhaari madad maang luungaa
 “later in the nineties, when i traveled with Ratan to Europe and the Far East to raise money for Tata Steel, he never insisted on being treated as special chairman himself
 in yatraaon main ratan hameshaa apni baat ko badi vinamrata se rakhte or agar kisi masale par aalaa afasaron kii raay alahada rahati, to unhen maanane main dikkat nahin hoti thi
 They never used to impose their views on us
 saatven dashak kii shuruyaat main jab ve nelco ko dekh rahe the, tab mujhe unke bare main pataa chalaa tha
 He was still very humble later when he came back as a board member of Tata Sons, and this would probably be the beginning of the eighth decade
 ve kisi bhi masale kii gaharaai main jate hai, isliye unhen bevakoof bananaa aasaan nahin he
 There is another quality attached to him — his memory is very sharp
 ratan tata kaa daur jearady ke daur se alag tha
 In JRD era, the government used to tell us how much to produce, when to do it and whom to sell
 ratan ke chairman banane ke aasapaas hi aarthik udaarikaran shuru hua
 But both were morals in business
 jearady kii jeevani main likhaa he, unhen yah mahasoos hota tha ki agar tata bhartiya kaarobaar main prachlit tareekon kaa istemaal karti to doguni badi company ho sakati thi, lekin iske liye unhen vahi tareeke apnaane pade
 Ratan Tata also used to always say that he would not do anything that could not make him sleep at night

 Regardless of the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping to be held on April 27-28, the agenda may not be set
 lekin ye mulaakaat kai myne main ahm he
 It is certain that when modi-jinping will meet, the issue of negotiation will not be to extradite Nirav Modi and tighten terrorist Masood Azhar
 bina agenda baatcheetadrasal donon rashtradhyakshon ke paas baatcheet ke liye do din kaa vakt he, or abhi tak koi masauda taiyaar nahin he ki donon ke bich kis mudde par baatcheet hogi
 In such a situation, the two leaders will try to negotiate issues that are in the interest of both countries and have a wider impact

 The world's largest and largest glass bridge in Hunan province of China was opened for tourists
 prabandhan samiti ne bataaya tha ki yah pul 430 meter lanbaa or chah meter chaudaa he
 It has three layers of transparent vials
 is pul ko jameen se 300 meter upar do chattaanon ke bich banaaya gaya he
 According to the committee, the bridge set a world record because of its amazing design and construction
 khaas baat yah he ki is pul par pratidin adhiktam 8,000 yatriyon ko aane kii manjuuri he or iske liye ek din pehle aarakshan karwaanaa padataa he
 (from input language) aksar hamaari maanen hamen hari subjiyan khaane ke liye naseehaten detii rahati hai
 While most of us do not like eating vegetables, we keep making new excuses every day to avoid the scolding of the mother
 aise logon ke liye ek khushkhabari he
 Yes, a recent study has given us a solid excuse
 bibisi main prakashit study kii report ke mutabik kuch subjiyon kaa aapke test-bads se to kuch lenaa-dena nahin hota, lekin unka sidhaa sambandh aapke jeens se hota he
 According to experts from the University of Kentucky's School of Medicine, "there are 25 different taste receptors in our mouths
 inamen se test bed TAS2R38 par sabase zyada research kii gai he, jiske do verient AVI or PAV hai
 50 per cent of us inherit AVI and PAV, both variants of TAS2R38
 aise log kadava or meetha donon hi swaad mahasoos karte hai
 Also, they are not particularly sensitive to bitter taste
 vahiin anya 25 fisadi logon ko 'non tester' kaha jaataa he, kyonki aise logon main AVI kii do kapiyaan hoti hai
 Non-testers are not at all sensitive to bitter food
 yahaan tak ki aise logon ko khaanaa thodaa meetha lagata he
 At the same time, the last 25 percent of those called 'super testers' have two copies of PAV
 aise log kadave swaad ke prati kuch zyada hi samvedansheel hote hai
 "people inheriting two copies of the PAV find vegetables such as Brockley, Sprats, Cabbage, Spinach and bitter gourd very bitter
 haalanki in subjiyon main bharpoor maatra main poshak tatv paae jate hai, lekin phir bhi kuch log inhen apane test bads kii vajah se kha hi nahin pate hai
 At the same time, food scientists say that completely rejecting vegetables is not good for health
 jo log hari patteydaar subjiyan nahin kha pate hai unhen unka kadavaapan dur karne ke liye swaadisht tareeke se banaakar khaane kii koshish kerani chahie
 According to Professor Valerie Duffy of Connecticut University, "you have two copies of bitter jeans
 That doesn't mean you can't enjoy vegetables
" khaanaa pakaane ke tareekon main badlaav laakar aise khaane ko mjedaar banaaya ja saktaa he
 Vegetables can be made tasteful by adding garlic to vegetables or roasting them in the oven
 aapako bataa den ki is survey main kul 175 logon ne bhaag liya
 The survey revealed that people who have two copies of PAV genes eat less green vegetables
 yani ki agar agali baar aapaki mummy ne aapako hari subjiyon ke liye danta to aap unhen apane jeens kii duhai dekar batch sakate hai

 Contrary to reports and strong reaction from experts and former cricketers, a fellow cricketer said, 'laxman is not retiring yet
 unhone hamen jo sanket diye hai usase saaf lagata he ki yadi vah sanyas letaa he to hamen kaaphi pehle us bare main suchit kar degaa
 Laxman also gave a clear indication on Waka's nets on Tuesday that he does not intend to retire yet
 unhone tej garmi ke baavjood der tak ballebaaji kaa abhyaas kiya
 After this, Indian opener Gautam Gambhir also favored Laxman in the press conference
 unhone kaha, ‘meraa sawaal he ki ek vyakti hi kyon? chotii ke sabhi saat ballebaaj doshi hai
 We have failed as a unit, then why is Lakshmana being made the scapegoat? ' He said, 'he is a great player of Indian cricket
 vah bahut lambey samay se bhartiya cricket kii seva kar rahaa he
 No other has the right to decide about them
 keval or keval unheen ko apane bare main faisla karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 Gambhir said, "if there is criticism, it should not be an individual but the entire batting unit who embarrassed the team
" media, prashansak yaa purv cricketer unke sanyas kaa faisla nahin karenge
 He is still working hard
 keval ek pari kii baat he or unka aatmavishvaas laut aayega
 When Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was facing a one-match ban for slow over rate, was also asked about Laxman's retirement, he said, "I don't know anything officially yet
" yadi kisi baat main bada agar-magar ho to main uskaa jawaab dena pasand nahin karuunga
 i do not know where such things are coming from
 jab tak lakshmana khud mujhase aakar nahin kahata main is par koi kayaas nahin lagaana chahta
 'laxman's long-time partner Rahul Dravid also came to his rescue
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki unhen hataane kii baton se vah zyada prabhavit hoga
 i have not read anything like this and even Laxman is not bothered by it
 yah hamaare kaam kaa hissaa he
 When you are playing continuously, you have to accept it
 isi tarah se aage badha jaataa he
 He is a quiet man and i hope he makes a good comeback
 ’lakshmana ko ab khud ko sabit karne ke liye keval ek test match bachaa he
 He scored an excellent innings of 148 runs in Adelaide in 2003
 austrailia ne 556 ran banaaye lekin lakshmana or dravid ke bich 303 ran kii saajhedaari ke kaaran use tab bhi haar jhelni padi thi
 Laxman has also done well in odis at this ground
 unhone 2004 main yahaan ekmaatr vanade match zimbabwe ke khilaaf khelaa tha jisamen unhone 131 ran banaaye the

 aarope he ki yahaan kuch parivaar apane bujurgon ko baagh-bhaaluu jaise junglee jaanwaron kaa shikaar hone ke liye jangal main bhej rahe hai
 If the corpse is found in the forest after hunting, there is no government compensation
 lekin agar laash jangal kshetra ke baahar kisi khet yaa maidan main milti he to parivaar ko lakhon main muaavja miltaa he
 Explain that in recent times there has been an increase in the incidence of wild animal attacks on the elderly
 isi vajah se aisa shaq jataayaa ja rahaa he
 In the last 8 months, 15 people have fallen prey to wild animals
 inamen 14 hamalebaghor 1 hamalaa bhaaluu ne kiya
 Of these, 7 incidents occurred in the forest area and eight incidents occurred out of the forest

 Apart from this, the district administration has also given compensation under Farmers Accident Insurance
 bujurgon ke junglee jaanwaron ke shikaar hone par shaq ne ek video ke viral hone par bhi jor pakadaa he
 In the video, some people are picking up a corpse from a forest area and putting it in a sugarcane field
 andeh he ki ye isliye kiya gaya ki sarkari muaavja mil sake
 From 24 October 2016 to 1 July 2017, 15 people have fallen prey to wild animals

 The question is how to send the elderly to the forest or field
 duusari ore sthaneey log is tarah ke aaropon ko puri tarah galat bataa rahe hai
 He says that how can one send one's own elders to the mouth of death
 graminon ke mutabik jawan, buudhe sabhi khet par kaam ke liye jate hai
 When the tiger arrives, the youth runs away but the elders do not run away

 pilibhit ke diefo kailash prakaash ke mutabik jaanch karai ja rahi he
 He did not rule out the possibility of a change of venue for compensation
 diefo ke mutabik kuch maamalon main van vibhaag kii team pahunchane se pehle hi gramin pahunch gaye or shav ko uthaa liya gaya, jo ki galat he
 Chief Conservator of Forests of Bareilly, Arvind Gupta says that most of the elderly have died in tiger attacks
 unhone muaavje ke liye mritkon kaa sthaan badale jane jaise aaropo kii jaanch karaane kii baat kahi he
 Liquor businessman Vijay Mallya blamed the government for the sinking of his Kingfisher airline
 maalya ne apni maujuuda sthitiyon ke liye sarkaar kii nitiyon or aarthik dasha ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Mallya has said that public money was invested to save Air India, but the 'biggest domestic airline' (kingfisher) of that time was not helped

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) parmaanu hathiyaar rakhane vaale do padosi desh bharat or pakistan main pichley do dinon main aatankwaad ko lekar apane sabase tanaavpurn daur se gujarey hai
 India has destroyed the terrorist bases of jaish-e-mohammed which hit Pakistan's land by air strike
 duusari taraf, apni javaabi karrwai main pakistan kaa daawa he ki usne bharat ke do vimaan maar giraae hai or ek bhartiya payalat uske kabje main he
 When Pakistani aircraft entered the Indian border on Wednesday, the Indian Air Force immediately responded strongly and killed a Pakistani aircraft
 donon deshon ke bich charam par pahunch chukaa tanaav ab antarrashtriya hastkshep se kuch kam hota dikh rahaa he
 India was planning a retaliatory strategy, fearing the closure of civil airports in Pakistan and emergency-like situations in many cities
 isaki vajah se duniya bhar main chintaa bad rahi thi
 The question arises that how did the relations of the two countries deteriorate and the tension increased so much? What is its background and whose fault has the relationship deteriorated? Let's know
 
 
 maujuuda tanaav kis vajah se shuru huaagat 14 farvari ko ek fidaayin aatanki hamalavar ne kashmir ke srinagar ja rahe siarpief ke kafile par hamalaa kiya tha, jisase 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 jaish-e-mohammed, an active terrorist organization from Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack
 fidaayin hamalavar kashmir kaa hi rahane vaala ek yuvak tha, jise pakistan main prashikshan diya gaya tha
 The Indian government has been alleging for a long time that Pakistan is giving all such terrorist organizations full opportunity to land on their land, but Pakistan has been denying this
 bharat ne iske jawaab main mangalvaar ko pakistan kii jameen par ek airstrike kiya jise pakistan ke aatanki shiviron ke khilaaf pre-emptive yani rakshaatmak purv karrwai bataaya gaya
 India said that hundreds of terrorists have been killed in this attack, while Pakistan claimed that Indian aircraft have taken this action in 'haste' and no harm has been done to it
 yah tanaav khatarnaak kyon he?bharat or pakistan ke paas saikadon parmaanu hathiyaar hai or donon ne kai baar parmaanu pareekshan kiye hai
 Both countries have tested missiles with nuclear capability
 bharat ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki vah pehle parmaanu hathiyaar nahin istemaal karegaa, lekin pakistan aise kisi vaayade se bachataa rahaa he
 It is said that if Pakistan fires a missile, it will take only four minutes to reach India
 yahi sthiti bharat kii taraf se pakistan kii ore chode jane vaale mixilon kii bhi hogi
 The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has warned that any single nuclear attack on any one major city in India or Pakistan would have terrible consequences
 kaise shuru hua kashmir vivaad?saal 1947 main jab britain ne is ilaake ko aazaadee di to usne bhartiya mahadweep ko do deshon main baant diya
 India, a predominantly Hindu country, and Pakistan with almost a Muslim population, became Pakistan
 bharat main 500 se zyada desi riyasaton kaa vilay hua
 But Kashmir was a Muslim dominated area whose rulers were Hindus
 kashmir ke hindu raja ne yah tay kiya ki vah bharat ke saath jaaenge
 This was disputed and this led to the first war between India and Pakistan in 1947
 1949 main sanyukt raashtra ke ek prastaav ke dwaara donon deshon ke bich rishte saamaanya banaae gaye or niyantran rekha par donon senaayen dat gayi
 After this, in 1965 there was a war over Kashmir
 iske baad kya huabharat or pakistan ke bich 1971 main teesraa yuddh hua or purvi pakistan alag hokar bangladesh ban gaya
 After this, Pakistani army-terrorists infiltrated Kargil in 1999-2000, after which a confrontation took place again in both countries
 lekin yah badi jang yaa parmaanu hamale main badale, isse pehle hi maamla shant ho gaya
 This is in the army of India and Pakistan, there are about 130 crore people living in inter-india
 bharat ke paas kareeb 14 lakh sainikon kii badi fouj he
 On the other hand, Pakistan has a population of around 20 crores and has 6
 5 lakh sainik hai
 Both countries have invested billions of dollars on conventional weapons
 international institute for stritegic studies ke anusaar, pichley saal pakistan ne 11 arab dollar yaa apane jidipi kaa kareeb 3
 6 percent is spent on immunity
 isi tarah, bharat ne pratiraksha par 58 arab dollar yaa jidipi kaa 2
 1 percent is spent
 donon deshon main bad rahaa tha jan dabaavpakistan main sena kaaphi prabhavi bhoomika main rahati he
 However, this time only politicians have reacted in the whole matter
 videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne mangalvaar ke airstrike ke baad bharat ko hamalavar bataate hue kaha tha ki use iskaa nateeja bhugatna padegaa
 Qureshi accused PM Narendra Modi that he is playing in regional stability for the benefit of elections
 pakistan main jagah-jagah bharat virdohi pradarshan hue or vahaan kii media main jamkar bharat ke khilaaf maahaul banaaya gaya
 India stormed into Pakistan to avenge the Pulwama attack and carried out an air strike
 iske jawaab main jab pakistan ne bhi apane vimaan bhartiya seemaa main ghusaa die to desh bhar main pakistan ke khilaaf jabardast maahaul ban gaya
 Once again, there was a huge public pressure to avenge Pakistan
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) ke pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bhi kaha, 'satya or ahimsa to thik he, lekin duniya ko bharat kii takat ko samajhaana hoga
 'due to this, both countries came to the mouth of a big war and the whole world started worrying about it
 duniya ke bade desh yah nahin chaahate hai ki parmaanu sampann do deshon main jang shuru ho, kyonki ek baar aisa shuru ho gaya to iskaa ant bada bhayaavah hota
 Not only this, it would have become a big threat to the stability of the whole world
 haal main badi aarthik mandi jhel chuke duniya ke bade desh phir aise kisi sankat main nahin funsana chaahate hai
 (based on input from news agency AP) maharashtra main power ke liye pavaar nae raajnneetik sameekaran banane main jute gaye hai
 According to NCP sources, Sharad Pawar may meet BSP chief Mayawati in New Delhi on Thursday
 india today group ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik pavaar aagaamee maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bispi se gathbandhan ko lekar baat karne vaale hai, kyonki agar aisa hota he to maratha-dalit vot bank ko ek saath saadhaa ja saktaa he
 Actually, Mayawati's party has a good presence in the Dalit community of Maharashtra
 khaskar vidarbha main bispi kaa vot fisad bahut hi acha he
 Although the party has not got a single seat in the area, it is believed that the congress-ncp alliance has suffered a lot from the BSP in the region
 aise main agar rajya main nae raajnneetik sameekaran banate hai to sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki kya pavaar congress kaa saath chhod denge?maharashtra main gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kaa jo maujuuda swaroop he usamen shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan ne loksabhaa chunaav main ramdaas ataavle ke jariye dalit vot jutaney main safalataa hasil kii he
 In such a situation, it has become necessary for any alliance to break into it during the assembly elections
 sharad pavaar ke is kadam ko maratha-dalit vot ke liye soshal ejineering kii kavayad ke rup main bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 The NCP is already raising its voice on the reservation for the Maratha caste, while the government says it wants to stay away from the reservation issue as it will send a wrong message to the OBC community
 upi ke ghaziabad main rahane vaale 45 saal ke atul saluja khud ko khushkismat maanate hai
 Because in the hospital where he was doing his treatment, he got a new lease of life thanks to a patient whose heartbeat had stopped
 atul saluja ko liver transplant kii darkaar thi, lihaaza wo bi el kapur super speshility hospital main apana ilaaj kara rahe the, isi bich aspataal main ek marij kii cardiyak atake se maut ho gai
 Whose liver was transplanted to Atul Saluja
 pehali baar cardiyak atake ke baad safal liver transplantbharat main pehali baar cardiyak atake ke baad kisi mrit vyakti kaa liver duusare vyakti main transplant kiya gaya yah apane aap main anokhaa maamla isliye he kyonki ab tak aisa naa hone kaa daawa doctoron kii ore se kiya ja rahaa he
 Earlier whenever a liver transplant was done, a living person donated or a liver dead person was transplanted and given a new life to another patient
 lekin aspataal ke doctoron ne cardiyak deth ke baad ek mrit vyakti kaa liver jaruratmand vyakti ko transplant kiya wo bhi sirf 30 minute main
 According to Dr
 Sanjay Singh Negi, Senior Consultant and Director of the hospital, 'blood circulation in the liver stops for a while after death due to cardiac attack, which leads to lack of oxygen in the tissues
 aise stage ko chikitsiya bhashaa main iskemia kehete hai
 The duration of which is only 30 minutes in case of liver while for kidney transplant, this duration is about 2 hours
 ' agar cardiyak deth marij kaa liver 30 minute ke andar duusare sharir me transplant nahin kiya gaya to phir liver fail ho jaataa he, uske baad uskaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa yaa yun kahen ki phir vah liver kisi kaam kaa nahin rahata
 According to doctors, despite the cardiac death many times, the dead person's liver does not reach the needy person either because the dead person's relatives are not ready for organ donation or to move such liver from one hospital to another
 For which the time of 30 minutes is very less
 khaas baat ye he ki liver transplant ke maamle menmaiching dhundne kii jarurat nahinpadati, isiilie aise marij jinaki maut cardiyak atake se yaa kisi vajah se aspataal main ho jaati he, unke parijanon ko liver or duusare orgen jarur donnet karne chahie taaki kisi jaruratmand kii madad ho sake
 Let me tell you that 1 in India

 There are many players in this world of football who have their eyes on the whole world and their country's hopes are set on them
 inamen sabase upar naam he portugal ke shandaar or duniya ke sabase amir footballar christiano ronaldo kaa jise abhi duniya kaa sabase behtareen footballar mana jaataa he
 But Argentina's Lionel Messi is also considered the top player and he also has high expectations
 messi ko footbal kii duniya kaa sabase jeniyas khilaadi mana jaataa he
 His game is natural and full of combativeness in it
 footbal ke mahanatam khilaadi diego maradona kaa maananaa he ki messi kaa loha sari duniya maanegi
 He was considered the world's best footballer for four years from 2010 to 2013
 yah ek aisa record he jise shaayad hi koi tod paae
 He has immense potential and he has the ability to win the team
 mejabaan brazil ke tej tarraar khilaadi nemaar par to sabhi kii nigahen hai
 It is believed that this World Cup has the highest expectations from this player
 pichley saal usne hi apni team ko vishwavijeta spain ko haraane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Looking at his skill and passion, it is being said that he can give Brazil this World Cup
 brazil ke hi left back khilaadi marcelo se bhi utani hi ummiden hai
 He is considered to be the best left back in the world
 vah na keval dephence main paarangat he balki atake main bhi
 His dribbling makes the audience crazy
 apane desh ko chhathi baar yah shandaar cap dilaane ke liye vah betaab he
 Brazil's central back Thiago Silva is also among the players who have the eyes of the whole world
 silva apni team kaa captain he or use jite dilaane ke liye jaan ladaa degaa
 He can play from every side
 uski hi team kaa rhite back dainis alves duniya kaa sabase badhiya rhite back he
 The ball keeps rolling in his footsteps and everyone is watching
 vishwa vijeta spain kaa captain iker casilas duniya kaa sarvshereshth golkeeper mana jaataa he
 His ability to withhold the shot of the world's greatest player has brought his team to a height
 uske saath hi uski team ke andres iniesti ko duniya kaa behtareen mid fielder mana jaataa he
 There is hardly any dribbler like that
 vah har tarah ke dephence ko bhed saktaa he
 How can Italy midfielder Andrei Pirlo be ignored? Once the ball comes to him, no one can easily snatch it from him
 netherland kaa khilaadi aren roben bhi ek aisa midfilder he jo maidan main dhooma machaa detaa he
 He can score the ball by taking the ball out of the players
 agar uske saathi uske paas kaa phayda uthaa gaye to bas uski team kuch bhi kar sakati he
 It would be a big mistake to underestimate the experienced German player Philipp Lam
 apni team kaa captain banane ke baad to uske khel main or bhi nikhaar aayaa he
 He has scored goals on several important occasions
 germany ke hi khilaadi close ke pradarshan par sabhi nigahen tiki rahengi
 The agility in this 36-year-old player is not seen even among the players half his age
 teen world cap final main usne 14 gol kar rakhe hai or vah ronaldo ke record se sirf ek gol peeche he
 23-year-old Iden Hazard of Belgium is one of the world's fastest-paced players and can penetrate any type of defense
 aise khilaadi virale dekhne ko aate hai
 Players in Asia are not as well known as European and Latin American players
 lekin korian khilaadi son hiung-min ko bhala kam karke kaise aanka ja sakaa he
 This stormy player is just 21 years old and his team has high hopes from him
 ye to wo khilaadi hai jin par sabhi kii nazaren hai lekin kai gumnaam khilaadi bhi hai yahaan jo kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 Maybe a new name shines on the football sky this time

 Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said that Digvijay, who specializes in confusing disputes, has given the said statement with the intention of giving a new screw to the case, but the BJP also wants Ishrat to come forward between Central Bureau of Investigation, Intelligence Bureau and National Investigation Agency Where the conflicting view of the matter should be clarified
 unhone kaha ki grih mantralay ko is baat kaa bhi spashtikaran dena chahie ki ishrat jahaan maamle main 2007 ke halafname ko 2009 main kyon or kiske kehane par badla gaya

 If he has shared Ishrat Jahan related information with the Prime Minister's Office, the silence of the PMO will not be helpful in resolving the case

 The comments 4
 How does it feel when you get tired and return home, and someone is ready to gossip over coffee for you? Obviously it is reassuring
 ye suvidha bhi liv in main milti he, wo bhi shaadi kii jimmedaariyon ke bina

 kisi bhi pal aapako lage ki aap jiske saath liv in main hai, wo aapke laayak nahin to aap unase rishta todakar ja sakate hai
 But in marriage, the matter goes to court

 When two people are working and live in, then this relationship is financially beneficial for both
 donon ghar ke saare kharche aadhe-aadhe share karte hai
 This saves both

 By spending a few hours a week together, you cannot decide what the front is really like
 kyonki jab bhi ham date par hote hai, to apana best project karte hai
 But when we spend the whole day with someone, we get to know a lot about his form and manner of thinking

 At any moment you feel that with whom you are in live in, it is not worthy of you, otherwise you can break away from them
 lekin shaadi main baat court tak chali jaati he

 Former Team India opener, Master Blastersin Tendulkar has made a big disclosure in his book 'playing It My Way'
 tendulkar ne team india ke purv coach greg chapel par tikhaa hamalaa karte hue likhaa he ki chapel kaa vyavhaar ek ring master kii tarah tha or vah apni baat khilaadiyon par thopate the
 Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that Greg Chappell suggested him to take over the captaincy of Team India in place of Rahul Dravid a few months before the 2007 World Cup
 unhone khulaasa kiya he chapel ne unke ghar par aakar unase kaha tha ki ham donon milakar saalon par bhartiya cricket par raaj kar sakate hai
 Tendulkar strongly criticized Chappell, who was the coach of Team India between 2005 and 2007, calling him a 'ringmaster' who used to impose his views on the players
 tendulkar ke anusaar chapel ko is baat kii tanik bhi parvaah nahin rahati thi ki unke is vyavhaar se khilaadi sahaj mahasoos kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 On the coach's attempt to make him captain in place of Dravid, Tendulkar wrote in detail, "A few months before the World Cup, Chappell came to my house and suggested that i should take the captaincy from Rahul Dravid
 ’ unhone likhaa he, ‘anjali bhi mere saath baithi thi or vah bhi yah sunakar hairaan thi ki ‘ham donon milakar saalon tak bhartiya cricket ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 And he will help me achieve the captaincy of the team
 ’tendulkar ne likhaa he, ‘mujhe hairaani hui ki coach captain ke prati thodaa bhi sammaan nahin dikhaa rahaa he, jabaki cricket kaa sabase bada toornament kuch maheenon baad hona he
 The star batsman said that he rejected Chappell's suggestion outright
 ‘vah do ghante tak rahe, mujhe manaane kii koshish karte rahe or aakhir main chale gaye
 Read on next page: Sachin's revelation about the 2007 World Cup sachintendulkar suggested to the board that the senior players can control the team and keep the team united
 unhone apni kitaab main likhaa he, ‘aisa nahin hua or 2007 ke abhiyaan kaa ant bhayaavah hua
 'team India could win only one match against Bermuda, losing to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka
 chapel ko aade haathon lete hue tendulkar ne kaha ki world cap main bharat ke niraashajanak pradarshan ke liye is australian ko bahut adhik jimmedaari leni chahie thi
 He wrote, 'I don't think i was far from it when i used to say that most of the players feel that Indian cricket was not moving in any direction while in the chapel
 ’tendulkar ne apni kitaab main likhaa he ki chapel saarvajanik taur par ‘hamaari patibaddhta par sawaal uthaa rahe the or hamen nae sire se shuruyaat karaane ke bajaay maamla or bigaad rahe the
 With Tendulkar, this book has been written by noted sports journalist and historian Boria Majumdar
 is star ballebaaj ne kaha ki kai senior khilaadi chapel ke jane se raahat mahasoos kar rahe the, ‘isse kisi ko hairaani nahin hui kyonki jo bhi kaaran rahaa ho, vah unke saath sahi tarah kaa bartaav nahin karata tha
 Tendulkar wrote, "to be honest, Sourav is one of the best cricketers in India and did not need Chappell's support to be part of the team
 ’ tendulkar ne kaha ki chapel senior khilaadiyon ko team se baahar karnaa chaahate the
 Read on next page: Chappell threatens Laxman
 
 
 jab chapel ne lakshmana ko di dhamkeetendulkar ne likhaa he, ‘lagata tha ki chapel kaa iraadaa sabhi senior khilaadiyon ko baahar karne kaa tha or is prakriya main team ke sadbhaav kaa nuksaan pahunchaaya
 On one occasion he asked VVS Laxman to consider starting the innings
 lakshmana ne badi shishtataa se ise asweekaar kar diya or kaha ki unhone apane kariyar ke shuruaati bhaag main pari kii shuruyaat karne kii koshish kii thi, kyonki tab vah asanmajas main tha, lekin ab vah middle order main jam chukaa tha or greg ko middle order ke ballebaaj ke rup main un par vichaar karnaa chahie tha
 'tendulkar further wrote in Laxman's case,' Greg's reply surprised all of us
 unhone lakshmana se kaha ki use satark rahanaa chahie kyonki 32 saal kii umr main vaapasi karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 'this legendary batsman wrote,' Actually i later found out that Greg had talked about the removal of senior players from the BCCI
 isamen andeh nahin ki unhone yah team ko nayaa rup dene kii ummid se kiya tha
 Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar also criticized the former Australian coach for his habit of being in the limelight and leaving players in the lurch in bad times
 tendulkar ne yaad kiya ki 2007 world cap se pehle daur main baahar hone ke baad ve kitna niraash the or tab vah kitne aahat hue the jab logon ne khilaadiyon kii patibaddhta par sawaal uthaae the
 He wrote, 'when we returned to India, the media persons came home with me and when i heard that my own people were doubting the commitment of the players, it hurt
 media ko hamaari asafalataa kii aalochana karne kaa puraa adhikaar tha, lekin yah kahana ki hamaara dhyaan kaam par nahin tha, sahi nahin tha
 Tendulkar wrote, "we did not live up to the expectations of the fans, but that did not mean that we should be called traitors
" kabhi pratikriyaayein ascharyajanak rup se behad dweshpurn hoti thi or kuch khilaadi apni suraksha ko lekar chintit the
 Tendulkar said that after the 2007 World Cup defeat, he had the idea of retirement, but family and friends asked him to continue
 unhone likhaa, ‘endulkar, jaise sheershak bahut aahat karne vaale the
 After spending 18 years in international cricket such things were difficult to bear and the idea of retirement came to my mind
 mere parivaar or sanjay nayak jaise mitron ne mujhe khush rakhane ke liye apni taraf se har tarah kii koshish kii or ek hafte baad maine isko lekar kuch karne kaa faisla kiya
 i started running
 yah world cap kii yaadon ko dimag se nikaalane kii koshish thi
 'sachin Tendulkar, who retired from the game in 2013 after setting numerous records in international cricket, has highlighted important moments in his career spanning over two decades, including his bad phase
 duniya bhar main chah november ko tendulkar kii aatmakatha 'plaing it maai ve' kaa vimochan hona he, jisamen is mahaan ballebaaj ne captain ke rup main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kii hataasha kaa bhi zikr kiya he

 Take pleasure in nature in the lap of nature Kimhara has 30 prisons but it will not be opened for all tourists
 aisi jail, jinka kuch dilachsap itihaas he, keval unheen ko is yojana ke antargat khala jayega
 On this plan, Ganapatipule is the most beautiful beach of Konkan coast, the jail authorities said, 'tourists will not be able to roam in the jail every day
 iske liye hafte ke kuch din or simit ghante tay kiye jaaenge
 We also have to keep in mind that some serial killers, terrorists and celebrities are also imprisoned in these jails

 In Bihar, there has been a decrease in crimes after bjp's separation from power, while BJP has been alleging that the law and order situation in Bihar has deteriorated ever since their alliance with the Janata dal-u was broken
 lekin neshnal krim ricard beuro ke aakadon se ye saaf pataa chalata he ki bihar main aparaadhon main kami ai he
 Shyam Razak, National General Secretary of Janata Dal u and Minister of Food and Consumer Affairs in the Government of Bihar, strongly criticized BJP, saying that not only crime has decreased in Bihar but out of all the BJP ruled states in the country, Bihar is the most Fewer criminal cases have been registered
 16 june 2013 ko bihar main janata dal you or bijepi kaa 17 varshon kaa gathbandhan samaapt hua
 Since then, BJP has been continuously attacking the Nitish government
 halaki saadhe saat varshon tak wo saath rahe tab unhen koi kami najar nahin ai lekin alag hote hi unhen sarkaar main har tarah kii khamiyaan najar aane lagi
 The BJP attacked the most with regard to law and order, because after their separation, for the first time terrorist attacks took place in Bodh Gaya and Patna in Bihar, mid-day meal scandal and communal tension in some places
 or ye sahi bhi he
 But at the same time, other crimes were controlled
 neshnal krim beuro ke aakadon ke mutabik jis maheene gathbandhan khatm hua us maheene yani june main hatya ke 313 maamle darj hue jabaki alag hone ke baad agast main hatya ke 299 maamle saamne aae
 Similarly, there were 102 cases of rape in June and in August it was 81
 june main apharan ke 515 or agast main 481 maamle darj hue
 Not only this, Shyam Rajak has also alleged that in criminal cases against women, Bihar is much less than the BJP ruled states of Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
 prati ek lakh mahila par aparaadh kii ausat dar 2012 kaa dekhen to bihar main yah 23
 41 percent, 33 in Gujarat
 58 pratishat he to chhatisgarh main 34 pratishat or madhya pradesh main sabase zyada 47
 75 percent
 yahi nahin pichley saal yani 2012 main padosi rajya jharkhand kii satta main rahi bijepi ke kaarykaal ke dauraan 29
 16 percent which was 23 in Bihar
 41 pratishat se kahin zyada he
 Shyam Razak said that when Nitish Kumar's government was formed in 2005, at that time Bihar was dominated by crime and criminals, but due to good governance, crime and criminals were tightened
 nateeja ye hua 2005 main jahaan 3423 hatya, 1191 dakaiti, 2379 lut, 251 phiroti ke liye apharan, 973 balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen hui thi
 In 2012, there were 3066 cases of murder, 540 of robbery, 1266 of robbery, 70 of kidnapping for ransom, 927 of rape cases which are less than 2005
 jediu kaa daawa he ki jin bijepi shasit rajyon kii charchaa ho rahi he unamem bihar kii aabaadi sabase zyada he
 That means more than one and a half times that of Gujarat
 baavjood iske 2012 main jahaan bihar main 160271 sangyeya aparaadh darj hue vahiin gujarat main do guna se bhi zyada 362649, madhya pradesh main 324845 or chhattisgarh kaa aankada 318615 he
 Shyam Rajak says that in these states the number of police per lakh people is also high
 bihar main prati ek lakh aabaadi par 67 pulicekarmi hai to chhatisgarh main 174, gujarat main 114 or madhya pradesh main police kii sankhya 104 he
 Bihar's Food Supply Minister Shyam Razak said that BJP leaders are trying to prove that criminals have increased in Bihar after their withdrawal, but the reality is completely opposite
 unhone kaha ki jab se bijpi satta se baahar hui he tab se bihar main hatya, balaatkaar, aprahan, lut evam danga jaise aparaadhon main kami ai he, isliye bijepi ke netaa bhram main naa rahen
 Mulayam, the wrestler, has beaten up the political stalwarts on several occasions
 charan singh, veepi singh, chandrashekhar, sonia gandhi, mamata banerjee sareekhe tisare morche ke kai netaa unke haathon dhobipachhad kha chuke hai
 Congress and Rahul too will not forget Mulayam's thrust in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 siyasat kaa sockrkuch yun hi mulaayam ke bete akhilesh yadav footbal khilne ke shaukeen rahe hai
 Have been taking special care about his image
 shaayad isi par yakeen karte hue rahul or priyanka kii jodi ne upi main talmail kii baat ko paravaan chadhaaya
 By the way, Rahul also played football before getting a knee injury
 siyasat ke maidan main bhi donon noujvaan netaa milakar bijepi or bispi kii siyaasi field main ghuskar danaadan gol daagne kii taiyaari karne lage
 Rahul did not have the chance to win, so Rahul took his team from Delhi to Delhi for campaigning
 is dauraan wo kisaan karj form bharva rahe the or '27 saal, upi behaal' kaa naaraa laga rahe the
 Brahmins were returning votes by making Sheila Dixit the CM candidate
 lekin bijepi or bispi kii majboot team ke aage tik nahin paane kaa ehsaas unako lagaataar ho rahaa tha
 At that time Rahul made up his mind to field his team in front of BJP and BSP under the leadership of Akhilesh
 akhilesh ko saunpi 'captaini'congress ko ye elaan karne main zyada vakt nahin laga ki is siyaasi match main akhilesh forward khelenge or congress unako back karegi
 The party left the field itself, describing Akhilesh Yadav as superior to its declared captain Sheela Dixit
 jab sab kuch mukhyamantri kii marji ke mutabik tay ho gaya to baat chunavi maidan main utarane vaale khilaadiyon kii sellection par atak gai
 The footsteps of footballer Akhilesh Akhilesh were unable to adjust the people according to Rahul's wish in his team
 aise main footbal ke shaukeen akhilesh ne pita kii pahalwani kaa siyaasi daanv chal diya
 The initial shock surprised Rahul
 akhilesh ne match se thik pehle hi apni team kaa elaan kiya
 Many players were also fielded on the position of political players of Team Rahul
 akhilesh ab tak upi kii janata or muslim matadaataaon ko sandesh de chuke the ki upi main congress unke hi sahare hai
 Also, they are reliably getting into a political match only when the Congress agreed to meet their team
 unhone hoshiyaari se gend congress ke paale main daali
 Now Rahul Gandhi has to decide that Akhilesh, who has been made the captain of his common team, should also give him the right to choose the team
 kul milakar akhilesh ne sabit kiya ki wo bhale hi footbal ke jaankaar hon, lekin mauka padane par pita kii pahalwani ke siyaasi daanv kaa bhi istemaal unako aata he
 At the same time, if Rahul Gandhi is not able to form a common team, then he will be accused of scoring a self-goal
 pita se jabaran captaini lene vaale akhilesh agar akele upi ke siyaasi match main utre or haar gaye to dohare iljaam kaa saamana karenge
 One is of not listening to the father and of betraying Rahul
 ab bas match shuru hi hone vaala he
 It remains to be seen whether Team Akhilesh and Team Congress land a joint team in UP
 lalan singh ne apane sankshipt bhaashan main kaaran bataae ki unki party vartmaan main bhartiya janata party ke kadam kaa samarthan kyon nahin karti
 He said that an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and a National Agenda of Governance was formed
 usamen in vivaadaaspad muddon se chhedchhad nahin karne kii sahmati bani thi jiske gavaah aaj sadan main raksha mantri rajnath singh or kendriya vidhi mantri ravishankar prasad hai
 Against this backdrop, the party is still retaining its old stand
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf agar centre sarkaar koi kadam uthaati he to unki party kaa is par puraa samarthan hoga
 Lallan Singh said that there was such a phase in the country especially between 2013-2014 when incidents of terrorism used to happen regularly and it was discussed in the House too
 sankalp liya jaataa tha ki aisi ghatnaon kii punrariti na ho iske liye kadam uthaae jaaenge
 Singh said that it is also a bitter truth that Jammu and Kashmir has been the center of terrorism and Pakistan does the work of providing manure and water in it
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki 2014 ke baad jo pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar bani he, aatankwaad kii ghatnaon main kami ai he
 Later, Lalan Singh said that whatever action the Central Government has taken to deal with terrorism recently, whether it is an amendment to the NIA Act or any other bill, his party supported it
 lekin 370 par phir unhone doharaaya ki unki party apane puraane stand par kaayam he isliye vah philhal samarthan nahin kar sakate

 The party's pain has come to the fore after the JDU did not find a place in the Modi government's cabinet expansion

 The JDU leader said that our leaders are not disappointed in the absence of a place in the cabinet but regret because it has given the opportunity to taunt the opponents, which is not right
 tyaagi ne kaha ki vaise to yah mantrimandalavistaar bijepi ke logon kaatha, isamen kuch ko hataaya gaya kuch ko shaamil kiya gaya, lekin hamaari party ko nyotaa nahin diya gaya
 Rajya Sabha MP KC Tyagi said that BJP leaders can answer why we were not given a place in the cabinet expansion
 unhone kaha ki aage hone vaale mantrimandal main ummid karte hai bijepi is baat kaa dhyaan rakhegi or bihar kii tarj par centre main bhi jediu ko apana sahyogi banaaegi
 Tyagi says that the Lalu whom we came to reject on the issue of corruption, the same Lalu Yadav is criticizing the people who are questioning us
 bijepi kii vajah se lalu ko yah mauka mila jo nahin hona chahie tha
 Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also targeted the media, saying that the issue of joining the cabinet was more discussed by the media when there was no such discussion
 vahiin jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne kaha ki mantrimandal vistaar par koi baatcheet hi nahin hui thi
