 Now this is political yoga or call it the politics of yoga, it is a matter of understanding a bit more, because the second aspect of the picture is completely different

 Sharad Pawar's power in running cricket in India will not play any innings anymore
 shanivaar ko unhone mumbai cricket association main apni pari khatm hone kaa elaan kar diya
 Former Union Minister Sharad Pawar is believed to have resigned from the post of MCA President amid pressure from the Supreme Court to implement the recommendations of the Lodha Committee to reform Indian cricket
 lodha cameti kii ek ahm sifarish he ki desh main cricket ke prashaskon kii umr 70 saal se zyada nahin honi chahie
 After Pawar's resignation, MCA vice-president VP Sethi said he resigned following the Supreme Court's decision
 aage hamen kya karnaa he
 
 iskaa faisla managing cameti kii agali baithak main hoga
 About this, Mumbai BJP President and MCA Vice President Ashish Shelar said, i came to know about it in the morning
 pavaar sahab ne cricket ko bahut kuch diya he
 This is very unfortunate for us
 tippaniyan In June 2015, Sharad Pawar was elected President of Mumbai Cricket Association for the third time
 isse pehle pavaar 2005 se 2008 tak bisisiai ke adhyaksh bhi the
 Sharad Pawar was also the President of International Cricket Council ie ICC from 2010-2012
 vaise sharad pavaar ne july main kaha tha ki wo cricket ke alaava or bhi jin khelon se bataur prashaasak jude hai, usase bhi ritairement le lenge, lekin kuch dinon pehle emsie ne lodha cameti ke khilaaf bombai hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhatane kii sochi thi, baad main iraadaa badal diya tha
 An important recommendation of the Lodha Committee is that the administrators of cricket in the country should not be more than 70 years of age
 pavaar ke istife ke baad emsie ke upaadhyaksh veepi sethi ne kaha unhone supreme court ke faisle ke baad istipha diya
 What do we have to do next 
 This will be decided in the next meeting of the managing committee
 is bare main mumbai bijepi adhyaksh or emsie upaadhyaksh ashish shellar ne kaha mujhe is bare main subah hi pataa chalaa
 Pawar sir has given a lot to cricket
 ye hamaare liye bahut durbhagyapurna he
 The comments june 2015 main sharad pavaar teesri baar mumbai cricket association ke president chune gaye the
 Prior to this, Pawar was also the President of BCCI from 2005 to 2008
 sharad pavaar 2010-2012 tak international cricket council yani isisi ke bhi adhyaksh rahe
 By the way, Sharad Pawar had said in July that he would take retirement from other sports besides cricket, as administrator, but a few days ago MCA thought of knocking the door of Bombay High Court against Lodha Committee, later The intention was changed

 purv bhartiya captainon sunil gavaskar or kapil dev ne kaha he ki lodha samiti kii kuch siforishein kaaphi kadi hai jisamen ek rajya ek vot or prashaskon ke liye teen saal kaa brake shaamil he
 Gavaskar and Kapil were preceded by former captain Ravi Shastri who also advocated dialogue between the Lodha Committee and the BCCI to resolve controversial issues
 in donon diggajon kaa maananaa he ki kaam karne or niyantran ke liye bisisiai kaa dhaancha alag tarah kaa he or isliye samiti kii sari siforishein uske liye shaayad phydemand nahin hon
 Gavaskar said, 'three of the Bhadrajans were involved in the committee and gave recommendations
 main unka puraa sammaan karata hum
 i think one state one vote is somewhat stringent for unions who are founding members of the board
 agar aap england jaaoge to dekhoge ki sabhi county english county championships main nahin khelti
 Not all states play in Australia's first class championship (sheffield Shield)
 isliye prayek rajya ke ranjai trophy khilne se cricket ke str main kami aegi or antarrashtriya str par hamen madad nahin milegi
 ' bharat or newjiland ke bich yahaan chal rahe pehle cricket test ke dauraan jab saathi camentator sanjay manjrekar ne lodha samiti kii siforeeshon par najariya jaananaa chaha to gavaskar ne kaha, ‘philhal aisa kiya gaya he ki jahaan timen junior str par khel rahi hai vahaan agar aap acha kar rahe hai to aapako aage ke str par bheja ja rahaa he
 Like Chhattisgarh did well at junior level and then it was promoted and this is the way to work
 aap rajyon ko ranjai trophy main sidhe pravesh nahin de sakate
 ' kapil ne bhi kaha ki vah kuch siforeeshon ko taarkik maanate hai lekin kuch kaaphi kadi hai
 He said, 'I am very happy with the things that i learned about
 sabhi ke liye aayu seemaa nirdhaarit kar di gai he
 i have one year left to be a selector because it has been said to be 60 years old
 lekin mujhe yah samaj main nahin aata ki maharashtra kaa sirf ek vot he
 How a place like Mumbai will get a chance to vote after three years which has done so much for cricket
 ’ The first Indian captain to win the World Cup said, "there is a need to keep the mindset open
 aap yah nahin kah sakate ki yah meri cheez he or yah aapaki
 We have to take the game ahead of time and then it will be better
 agar aap vichaaron ko lekar ade rahenge to isse kisi kaa bhala nahin hoga
 They will have to sit down and discuss what is best for cricket
 ’ kapil ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki kuch siforishein kaaphi kadi hai
 Do not snatch anything from the BCCI
 unhone 60 se 80 saal tak khel kii dekhbhaal kii he
 i think people should be patient and see what is best for the game
 ’ In terms of tenure and break, Gavaskar said that like cricket, the administrative structure also requires a mixture of youth and experience
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane dekha he ki bhartiya cricket team main teen se chaar senior or ek yaa do junior khilaadi shaamil rahe hai maine samachar patron main siforeeshon ke bare main jo padhaa he unase mujhe lagata he ki aapke saamne aisi sthitiyaan bhi aati hai jahaan aap aise logon ko chaahate hai jo lambey samay se sanstha kaa hissaa rahe hai
 Kapil Dev retired
 maine khel se sanyas kiya
 Administrators need to look into this
 ’ Gavaskar said that the tenure limit would be of no use as it would halt the progress of potential administrators
 unhone kaha, ‘prashaasak ke kariyar main sheersh pad kya hota he
 To be president
 aap teen saal main adhyaksh nahin ban sakate
 You are the Chairman because you have spent some tenures as the Vice President
 us str par pahunchane ke baad aap adhyaksh banate hai
 Kapil said that India is a very big country and in view of that, the tenure of selectors should be at least five years
 unhone kaha, ‘teen saal kaaphi kam he
 Some things are happening and when you know whether you should do it or not, time runs out
 itane bade sanghathan ko chalaanaa choti cheez nahin he
 Maybe 30 years ago it was different
 tab bahut saare coach or prabandhan nahin hota tha
 Now you have professional people to help you
 aaj board badal gaya he
 Comments kapil ne kaha, ‘doordarshan se shuru karke aaj board kaa apana apana production he
 We should be proud of it
 board kaa samvidhan kya kahata he
 It says improve sports in India
 hamen yah prayaas karne kii jarurat he
 We should not forget those who have run this game for so many years
 hamen unka sammaan karnaa chahie lekin saath hi badlaav kii jarurat hoti he or isamen koi nuksaan nahin he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Both these stalwarts believe that the bcci's structure for functioning and control is different and hence all the recommendations of the committee may not be beneficial for it
 gavaskar ne kaha, ‘jo teen bhadrajan samiti main shaamil the or siforishein deen
 i fully respect him
 mujhe lagata he ki ek rajya ek vot un sanghon ke liye kuch kadaa he jo board ke sansthaapak sadsy hai
 If you go to England, you will see that not all counties play in the English County Championship
 australia kii pratham shrenee championships (shefield shield) main bhi sabhi rajya nahin khelte
 So playing Ranji Trophy in each state will reduce the level of cricket and we will not get help at the international level
 ’ During the first cricket Test between India and New Zealand here, when fellow commentator Sanjay Manjrekar sought to see the recommendations of the Lodha Committee, Gavaskar said, "at the moment it has been done that where teams are playing at junior level, if you If you are doing well then you are being sent to the next level
 jaise ki chhattisgarh ne junior str par acha kiya or phir use pramot kiya gaya or yahi kaam karne kaa tarika he
 You cannot give direct entry to the states in the Ranji Trophy
 ’ Kapil also said that he considers some of the recommendations to be logical but some are quite strict
 unhone kaha, ‘jin kuch chizon ke bare main pataa chalaa main unase kaaphi khush hum
 The age limit has been set for all
 chayankarta banane ke liye mere paas ek saal bachaa he kyonki isamen 60 baras kaha gaya he

 Bharatiya Janata Party national president Nitin Gadkari spoke to Headlines Today executive editor Rahul Kanwal on a wide range of issues including the current state of politics, his role in the party and the role of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 yahaan pesh hai baatcheet ke khaas anshambabu singh kushvaha jaise bhrasht netaa bispi se nikaale gaye, aapane unako gale lagaaya
 Why did you do this? See, when the BJP took him, then no FIR was registered against him, nor was any CBI action taken
 jo aarope kushvaha par hai vahi aarope mulaayam singh ji par hai, mayawati ji par hai
 No one is corrupt by saying in the media and if you are talking so much then S
 em
 Such a big decision of the High Court came against Krishna, what are you doing against him? The second important thing is that Kushwaha ji himself has suspended his membership
 is par kisi prakaar kii charchaa nahin he
 Meaning, Nitin Gadkari is ready for any kind of bargaining for votes
 kushvaha jati kaa vot aapako chahie to netaa bhrasht ho yaa jaisaa bhi?aap kuch bhi kah sakate hai
 The agenda of this country cannot be run only by the media
 pehali baat yah he ki kushvaha ji ne apni sadsyta khud hi khatm kar lee
 The topic is over
 aapaki party ke netaa naaraaz hai or ek bhi kendriya netaa uttar pradesh main chunaav prachaar nahin kar rahaa he?abhi campan shuru hi nahin hui
 The rest of the parties are enthusiastic, but you are sitting with your mouth full? All your leaders are in Delhi and you say that the election is a question on your nose? See, no one is sitting with puffed eyes
 aap galat baaten bataakar logon ko bhatka rahe hai
 Anyway, it is wrong to call the election a question of one's nose
 main bhaajapa kaa kaaryakrrta hum or yah chunaav party kii pratishtha kaa he
 Your term is coming to an end later this year, what will happen after that? He is currently the chairman
 ladaai karte phir rahe hai, sabko daantate phir rahe hai
 i don't worry about my term, so why are you doing it? Nitin Gadkari has come into politics to work for the country, society and the poor
 main koi mahatvakanksha se pad hasil karne ke liye nahin aayaa or na kisi kii krupa hasil karne ke liye
 The news is hot that Narendra Modi wants to come out of Gujarat and he will come to Delhi as the first party president, appointing a successor in Gujarat
 mujhe koi aapatti nahin he, agar party faisla karti he to main is vichaar kaa samarthan karuunga
 However, the decision to deploy the chairman is not a matter of discussion with the media
 yah party netritv ke bich gopneey paricharrcha kaa vishay he
 Will Modi prove to be a good president? He is a fully qualified person for the party president

 Look at the Batla encounter, Chidambaram is saying that he was not a fake encounter
 unki party unhen gambhirtha se nahin leti to aap or ham kyon len
 But it seems that by following his strategy, Rahul Gandhi has filled the Congress with enthusiasm in UP? Where do you see enthusiasm? The entire box will ring - the band will play
 digvijay singh or ranneeti, kisi baat karte hai aap
 What will happen after the election? bhaajapa ko bahut acchhee safalataa milegi
 But with the kind of signals that analysts are giving, it seems that the BJP will slip from third to number four? i keep a close eye on the survey and everything else

 Failing to get any relief from the apex court, the batch of senior lawyers including Ram Jethmalani and Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared in the court on behalf of various accused, immediately went to Lower Court with the intention of exempting Ambani and his wife Tina Ambani from testimony
 loar court ne isse pehle anil ambani se poochtacha par roak laga di thi, lekin buudhvaar ko court ne aaropee kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya or saaf shabdon main kaha ki in gavaahon se poochtacha se kisi aaropee par kisi tarah kaa pratikul prabhaav nahin padegaa

 "he said," Even more, when the speedy application is presented by the accused rather than a witness, accordingly i do not find any reason to accept that application and hence it is rejected
 ’loar court ne 19 july ke apane aadesh main sibiai kii us daleel kaa hawala diya tha, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki maamle main sahi faisle par pahunchane ke liye anil ambani, tina ambani or 11 anya ko abhiyojan ke gavaahon ke taur par bulaanaa jaruri he

 com / mytrkgbf4m Nageswara Rao, a 1986 batch Odisha cadre IPS officer, was assigned the duties and functions of CBI Director on October 23, 2018, after sending Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana on leave
 adhikariyon ke anusaar agali subah hi raav ne bade paimaane par tabadale kiye
 They included officers investigating the corruption case against Asthana like DSP AK Bassi, DIG MK Sinha, Joint Director AK Sharma
 ek adhikari ne pahchaan ujagar nahin karne kii shart par bataaya ki alok verma ne buudhvaar ko apana daayitv sambhaal liya or raav dwaara kiye gaye sabhi tabadale radd kar die
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had quashed the Central Government's order to send Alok Verma on leave, depriving him of the powers of the CBI Director
 haalanki, court ne verma ke par katarte hue saaf kar diya tha ki bahaali ke uparaant sibiai pramukh kaa chayan karne vaali ucchadhikaar samiti ke unki shaktiyaan chhinane ke mudde par vichaar karne tak vah koi bhi bada nitigat faisla karne se parhez karenge
 Verma's two-year tenure as CBI director ends on January 31
 baharhaal, verma ko shaktiyon or adhikaron se vanchit karne kii talwaar ab bhi unke sir par lataki hui he
 The apex court has said that the high-powered selection committee, which selected the CBI chief, may still consider the case related to Verma, as the CVC is investigating corruption charges against him
 chayan samiti ko ek hafte ke bheetar baithak bulaane ko kaha gaya he
 The court said that there is no provision in the law regarding interim suspension or removal of CBI director
 sheersh adaalat ne saaf kar diya ki is tarah kaa koi bhi faisla chayan sahmati kii sahmati lene ke baad hi kiya ja saktaa he
 The three-member bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice KM Joseph, in its 44-page judgment, deprived Verma of his powers and made Joint Director m Nageswara Rao the interim director of CBI and CVC and Personnel and Training
 October 23, 2018 orders of the department (dopt) were repealed
 peeth ne apane faisle main kaha ki ham yah nirdesh dena uchit samajhate hai ki sibiai nideshak verma apane pad par behaal hone par samiti se aisi karrwai yaa nirnay lene kii anumati milane tak koi bhi bada nitigat faisla nahin karenge or aisa karne se bachenge
 This decision was written by the Chief Justice, but since he was not present today, Justice Kaul pronounced this decision
 iske saath hi nyaayalay ne apane faisle main pradhanmantri, pradhan nyaayadhish or netaa pratipaksh (loksabhaa main sabase badi vipakshi party ke netaa) kii sadsyta vaali ucchadhikaar praapt samiti ko ek saptaah ke bheetar baithak karne ke liye bhi kaha
 Verma was appointed to the post of CBI Director for two years on 19 January 2017, based on the decision of the Empowered Selection Committee

 Sarita (name changed) used to work in a large multinational company in Mumbai and was getting ready to go from home to her office as usual
 or usee tarah ghar se daftar ke liye nikali bhi
 She was moving her steps towards her office but she was not even aware that a storm had come in her life
 or jaise hi usne apane kadam apane daftar main rakhe wo apane saath kaam karne waalon ke chehre dekh kar hairaan rah gai
 Because there was a question on every face
 har ek aankh main ek tanz tha or har koi use dekh kar usase batch kar nikalnaa chahta tha
 Sarita (name changed) was surprised to see such attitude from her colleagues
 wo jaananaa chaahati thi ki ek raat main aisa kya hua he ki uske saath kaam karne vaala har shaks badal gaya he
 Everyone wants to avoid him
 abhi wo in sawaalon ke bare main soch hi rahi thi ki uske saath kaam karne vaali mita ne use bataaya ki kisi ne ek social bevesite par kuch ulta-sidhaa likhaa hua he
 As soon as Mita opened that website, she too was surprised to read about herself
 kyonki uske bare main jo likhaa tha ki use pard kar uske bhi paanv tale kii zamin khisak gai
 Now Sarita understood that someone had done a very lewd joke with her and threw mud on the character
 ab use samaj main aayaa ki kyon uske offis ke log usase thik se baat nahin kar rahe the or kyon naa hi product kharidne vaale graahak hi phone uthaa rahe the
 Sarita could not understand anything about who is such a dirty joking person
 or uski sarita se aisi kya dushmani he jiskaa badla wo use badnaam karke le rahaa he
 Seeing no answer to her questions, she called her husband and narrated the whole story to her husband
 ye sab kuch sunne ke baad sarita ke pati ne use is bare main police main shikaayat darj karwaane ke liye kaha
 And now the matter had reached the police
 echaar kii senior afasar shame ke maare kisi se aankh bhi nahin mila paa rahi thi
 The company's staff were constantly watching him with suspicion
 use khud samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki ye sab kya or kaise ho rahaa he ? or phir tabhi police ne apni tahakikat shuru kii
 But he had no clue to reach the culprit
 lihaaja maamle kii jaanch mumbai sibar cell ko saunp di gai
 While investigating the matter to the police, it was known that the work of someone in the office is there
 lihaaza usne bevesite par sarita ke bare main likhe massej kii padtaal kerani shuru kii
 And soon he got a breakthrough
 police ko massej ko likhane vaale computer kaa ypi adress mil chukaa tha
 Immediately a police team left for that house
 lekin jab wo us ghar par pahunchi to wo bhi hairaan rah gai
 Because no one else owns the computer at home, but was CEO of Sarita's company
 jab police ne is maamle main siio se poochtacha kii to pehle to usne im maamle ke bare main koi jaankaree hone se inkaar kar diya
 But when the police strictly questioned him, he broke down and confessed his crime
 is mahila siio ne police ko bataaya ki sarita ne thode hi vakt main company main kaaphi tarakkee kar lee thi
 And he did not like this thing
 wo chaahati thi ki sarita kisi bhi tarah company ke maalik or graahakon ke saath-saath offis main bhi badnaam ho jaae
 So that he is fired
 or isi liye usne sarita ko badnaam karne ke liye ye saazish rachi thi
 Nobody thought that the CEO of a company would create such a disgusting conspiracy by burning his own subordinates
 khayr peedit mahila ko bhi jab is baat kaa pataa chalaa kii usase badnaam karne kii ghinauni sajeesh kii sutaradhar uski company kii sieo hi he uske hosh phakta ho gaye lekin mahila hone ke naate usne apni shikaayat to waapas le lee
 The same police, by writing an apology to this accused woman CEO, warned them against such action in future

 shivasena pramukh ke sir sajega kaanton bharaa tajuddhav ko kai chunautiyon kaa karnaa hoga saamanashivsena sansthaapak bal thakare ke sapane ko uddhav thakare saakaar karne ja rahe hai
 He will take oath of Chief Minister this evening at Shivaji Park
 satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hone se pehle shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki mukhyamantri kii kursi main bahut keelein hoti hai
 It is clear that Uddhav Thackeray's head is full of crowns of thorns
 uddhav bhale hi kursi ke liye bijepi se naata todakar congress-ensipi ke saath sarkaar banane ja rahe hon, lekin chunautiyaan bhi kam nahin he
 In such a situation, how long will Uddhav Thackeray be told by the chair of nails, which will be able to stick to it? shivasena-congress-ensipi teenon dalon kii apni-apni vicharadhar or raajnneetik agenda hai
 The three parties are completely different from each other in terms of ideology and culture
 chunaav ke baad satta ke liye bane gathbandhan kaa trek record bahut acha nahin rahaa he
 That is why Uddhav Thackeray, from the BJP to the political pundit, is not seeing the government go the distance
 haalanki shivasena ke netaa kah rahe hai ki yah gathbandhan paanch saal ke liye nahin balki 25 se 30 saal ke liye bana he
 Keeping the Hindutva image intact, Shiv Sena has gone ahead from the beginning with the image of staunch Hindutva
 uddhav thakare ne saavarkar ko bharat ratna dene kii bhi maang kii thi
 Not only this, he also took an active part in the Ram temple movement in Ayodhya
 shivasena chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ko apni raajnneeti kaa adarsh maanati he
 In such a situation, there is a question that Shiv Sena has joined hands with parties like Congress and NCP for power
 aise main bijepi lagaataar sawaal khadi kar rahi he ki shivasena ne hindutv kii raajnneeti se samjhauta kar liya he
 However, Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday that the ideology of our Hindutva will continue
 ab dekhnaa he ki is par wo kitna barkaraar rahete hai
 How will you sit with the Center? Uddhav Thackeray has broken a 25-year-old relationship with BJP for the post of Chief Minister
 narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi kii sarkaar centre main he
 The way Uddhav Thackeray has taken a stand on the BJP, it will be a big challenge to keep pace with the Center
 iske alaava shivasena ke saamne bijepi jaisaa majboot vipaksh he, jise sadhakar chalanaa bhi uddhav ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 The challenge of maintaining satrap supremacy There are many areas in Maharashtra, where Shiv Sena and NCP are established as anti-social
 aise main kisi bhi ek party ko duusare ko nuksaan pahunchaakar hi un ilaakon main apni pakad majboot kerani hogi
 Shiv Sena and NCP had a direct contest in 57 seats in this time assembly elections
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki unki party ko mili voton main bada hissaa satta-virdohi maton kaa tha
 Some of this too fell into the ncp's bag due to Shiv Sena's opposition

 Good morning and i guess here is the first scene of Toilet Ek Prem Katha part 2 # whenyourwalkgoesdownthetoileta post shared by Twinkle Khanna (@twinklerkhanna) on Aug 18, 2017 at 10:26pm PDT The session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is to begin from October 4
 kareeb ek saal baad bijepi vidhayak om prakaash sharma dilli vidhansabha main maujuud rahenge
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has called a session of the assembly on October 4, in which a bill for services is to be introduced, that is, there is a case of recruitment of 15,000 guest teachers
 logon kii pidaa par raajnneeti kii aadatbijepi vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki sarkaar ko har khabar ko sensesnal banane or logon kii pidaa par raajnneeti karne kii aadat pad gai he
 The issue on which the Assembly session has been called does not come under the jurisdiction of the Assembly
 unhone kaha ki jo mudde adhikaar kshetra main hai un par seshan nahin bulaayaa jaataa
 According to the BJP, the rule is that any teacher in Delhi is recruited through the Delhi Subordinate Service Selection Board (DSSB), but the government is saying that we will do it
 bijepi vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki seshan ke jariye ye phir dikhaane kii koshish he ki dekhie hamane bill paas kar diya lekin centre sarkaar or bijepi isapar adnga daal rahi he
 Actually according to the rule, when the DSSB withdraws the recruitment, then these guest teachers can be recruited through the process
 jisamen dilli sarkaar guest teachers kii umr main chhot de sakati he or saath hi intervyuu ke dauraan unka vatage badha sakati he, jisase zyada se zyada ko naukari mil sake
 But what cannot be done is that the government has called a session of the Legislative Assembly on it, then tell the government what happened to the 15 bills passed and now a new bill
 aapako bataa den om prakaash sharma vahi vidhayak hai, jinakoam aadmi partiki vidhayak alka lamba ke khilaaf vidhansabha ke andar apshabd kaa istemaal karne par vidhansabha spikar ram nivas goyal ne do seshan ke liye suspend kar diya gaya tha

 Even though Lalu is still stuck in forming the Congress alliance, the BJP has got the option of Nitish in Bihar
 bijepi or upendra kushvaha kii nai party rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) ke bich gathbandhan tay ho gaya he
 Both seats have been agreed on three seats
 ab donon ke bich 1 seat ko lekar vaarta jari he, agle ek do dinon main is gathbandhan kaa aupchaarik elaan ho saktaa he
 As soon as the alliance between the two is decided, Kushwaha has also become a supporter of Modi
 bihar vidhansabha ke baahar dharne par jab bijepi ke vidhayak baithe to unka saath dene waalon main do aise log the jo kabhi nitish ke khasmkhas rah chuke he, lekin unhone ab endie kaa daaman thaamne kaa faisla kar liya he
 In Bihar, a new party will join the NDA called Rashtriya Lok Samata Party
 patna main kushvaha ne bhi mana ki desh main modi kii lahar he or wo ab is ganthbandhan kaa hissaa honge
 Kushwaha says that look at Modi's wave all over the country, Nitish Kumar has cheated everyone in Bihar, in such a situation we have got a rapport with BJP
 bijepi ne bhi aaj apni ore se is gathbandhan ko hari jhandi de di he
 According to Sushil Modi, the alliance is already just the last conversation
 susheel modi kii maane to kushvaha ke saath lagaataar baatcheet chal rahi thi
 Kushwaha was once Nitish's special friend, but due to differences, Kushwaha broke the relationship with Nitish two years ago, but now all parties have focused their attention on the Kushwaha vote
 darasal bihar main kushvaha jati kaa vot lagbhag 9 pratishat he or akele yadav ke baad yahaan yah sabase badi jati he
 In such a situation, in this caste traditionally living with Nitish, BJP has made preparations to break into it through Kushwaha
 bharat or dakshin africa ke bich teesraa or antim twanti-20 antarrashtriya cricket match baari barish ke kaaran radd kar diya gaya
 The authorities had to take this decision due to the wetting of the ground due to heavy rains
 match main ek bhi gend phenki nahin ja saki
 In this way, South Africa captured 2–0 on the 3-match series
 in donon tiimon ke bich ab 11 oktober se kanpur main paanch ekadivasiy maichon kii siries shuru hogi
 Match umpires Anil Chaudhary and Vineet Kulkarni and match referee Chris Broad inspected the pitch four times but after the third inspection at 9:30 pm they found the outfield not playable and decided to cancel the match
 eden gardens main maidan sukhaane ke liye kam se kam teen super sopers lagaaye gayi the lekin shaam ko baari barish ke kaaran maidan ek samay pani se bhar gaya tha jiskaa asar aakhir tak bana rahaa
 The pitch was covered from the start but the umpires found that the pitch did not dry well
 unhone match referi ko is bare main avgat karaayaa jiske baad match nahin khilne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Due to rain in the evening, very few spectators reached the stadium
 dakshin africa ne shrinkhalaa 2-0 se jeetne ke kaaran isisi tii20 ranking main paanchaven sthaan par pahunch gaya he jabaki bharat do paaydaan neeche chathe sthaan par khisak gaya he

 hamane vahaan koi upkaran nahin lagaaye hai
 ' saurav ganguli kii adhyakshata vaale cab prabandhan kii ise acchhee shuruuaat nahin mana ja saktaa he
 This may be considered surprising but during the rains only the ground on either side of the pitch and dressing room was covered by cover while Eden Gardens has options to cover the entire ground
 ganguli ne barish thamane ke turant baad maidan kaa nirikshan kiya tha

 Vidyasagar spent 6 lakhs from contemplation for treatment expenses
 udhaar liye the or unke kharche par jaipur main fabrication kii training lene ke liye ja chukaa tha

 Chintan was the first artist to have an advertisement for his show "commemorative Stamps" on the Bombay Times homepage and made a habit of appearing on page 3
 ve kala ko bade str par utaarne main vishwaas karte the
 That is why he enlisted the services of artists to paint Rajasthani miniatures in his "dirty Child" series of nude children and named them his company "chintan Unlimited"

 Finding a nest Despite false accusations of inexplicability that sparring between spouses, Hema filed a complaint under the Indecent Representation of Women (prohibition) Bill in 2010, describing the contemplation as psychiatric and alcoholic
 deshmukh kehete hai, “haalanki supreme court ne 2013 main bombai hycourt ke faisle par roak laga di thi, lekin donon ek-duusare ke prati sammaan ke saath pesh aate the
 Hema paid full respect to Chintan and his lawyers in the court while she was fighting a court battle for subsistence
 adaalat ne unki maang khaarij kar di thi, kyonki ve apekshaakrit zyada sampann thim
 The court allowed the two to divorce in 2014, but with a condition that guaranteed that Chintan could not marry a second marriage before the money dispute between the two ended
 hema ke vakil bhambhaani apil kar rahe the ki talaak galat tarah se diya gaya tha
 Nitin Pradhan, counsel for Chintan, says, "I refused to see his case in the High Court
 maine unase kaha tha ki main aise cese nahin letaa hum jinamein muvakkil vakeelon se kiraye kaa tattu hone kii ummid karata ho
 Pradhan says that Chintan and Hema used to greet each other in court with a smile
 ve aapas main majaak karte the or phir saath-saath khaanaa bhi khaaya karte the or ummid karte the ki unke vakil hi aapas main bhidate rahen
 In 2014, when Chintan filed a case in a Delhi court, he still lived together in his home in Juhu when he went to Mumbai and Hema cooked food for him
 adaalat main talaak ke maamle par ladaai karte hue or chintan kii ore se nirvaah kaa paisa dene se inkaar karne ke baad bhi donon ke bich is tarah kaa sahaj sambandh bana hua tha
 Pradhan says, "it is just a formality of the police to register Chintan's name in the murder case
" ” unhen puraa vishwaas he ki chintan kaa naam bedaag sabit hoga

 The BJP is now trying to win the Jharkhand Assembly elections on the basis of veterans
 sutron ke anusaar, bhaajapa ko chunavi majdhaar paar karaane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ab yahaan chah se aath chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar sakate hai
 In fact, the powerful coalition that the NDA won unilaterally in the Lok Sabha elections has shattered badly
 sabase pehle lojpa ne apana pallaa jhaad liya or uske baad ajasu ne bhi alag raah pakad lee
 In Jharkhand, disgruntled and rebel candidates of the BJP are also becoming a big headache
 khud raghubar das ko hi sarayu raay se sidhi takkar mil rahi he
 The battle in Jamshedpur East has become triangular
 bhaajapa ke kaddavar netaa sarayu raay ne unke khilaaf morcha khol diya he to congress ne apane tejatarraar pravaktaa gaurav vallabh ko tikat de diya
 To support Saryu Rai, the entire opposition is united in mobilization
 vichaar is baat par bhi chal rahaa he ki unhen samooche vipaksh kii taraf se ummidavaar bana diya jaae
 The question is, what is the strategy in Jharkhand for the BJP, which has not been able to achieve the expected success in the two assembly elections? Many angry with the bjp's ticket distribution, their 'rebellion' went to other parties and they took tickets from there to the electoral arena
 In the BJP, the candidates are pacing against the candidates
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sarayu raay sareekhe netaa ke party chhodane or ol jharkhand student union (ajasu) kaa saath chhot jane kaa prabhaav is chunaav main na pade, iske liye bhaajapa ne damege control shuru kar diya he
 The party is now trying to reach its star campaigners in more and more areas
 bhaajapa ke jharkhand pradesh mahaamantri deepak prakaash ne ieenes ko bataaya, "party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah 21 navambar ko latehar ke manika or lohardaga main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karenge

 "union Minister Nitin Gadkari will address an election public meeting on 22 November in Vishrampur in Palamu district
 iske baad vah usee din rajdhani ranchi main patrakaron se baat karenge
 According to a BJP leader, the state BJP now also wants more and more time to campaign for Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 pehle bhaajapa kii ranneeti pradhanmantri kii yahaan chaar-paanch chunavi sabhaayen yojit karne kii thi, lekin ab in chunavi sabhaaon kii sankhya badha kar aath-nau kii ja sakati hai
 Sources say that the Prime Minister may hold meetings in Palamu and Gumla on 25 November
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki party rashtriya muddon ko to chunaav main uthaaegi hi, parantu sthaneey muddon ko zyada tarjeeh di jaaegi
 The BJP has set up a war room in Ranchi to monitor electoral activities from where the electoral activities can be understood
 sutron ke anusaar, bhaajapa is chunaav main adivasee bahul siton par zyada dhyaan de rahi he
 This is the reason why BJP leaders are putting great emphasis on Santhal Parganas areas
 bhaajapa is chunaav main rakshaamantri rajnath singh or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko bhi chunavi sabhaaon ke liye utaaregi
 Apart from this, there are plans to field mps from Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in Jharkhand

 nijee spes kii talashamridula gargakthakaar mridula garg stri-purush ke liye alag-alag dhaanche-khaanche banane kaa virodh karti rahi hai
 Most of her stories, which are put to the account of 'female discourse', are the stories of a free-minded Chetas woman, who seek to carve out a distinct identity by crossing the lines of moral discipline, established by tradition-empowered male authority
 
 stri yahaan na purush se shreshth he or na kamatar, balki purush kii tarah hi khoobiyon-kharabiyon samet ek vyakti he, ek manushya
 The urge to live life in the desired way is as much within a woman as in a man

 If the established system has snatched even the smallest joys of life from the woman, then she too will find a private space for herself by creating cracks in the conservative society

 tuk main pati-patni kii ruchiyan bhinn hai
 The wife wants to offer love in total dedication, but the husband uses his wife's body and mind according to his mood
 haar kaa aakrosh ho yaa jeet kaa jashn, pratikriya or prayog stri-deh par hote hai
 Marital relationship here has become a business rather than one based on mutual understanding and intimacy, where profit-loss assumes compensation, not equal participation in love
 balki patni to yahaan 'robot' he, maanvi bhi nahin
 So, where is the need to understand her desire and spirit? Mridula's woman is very excited to live life

 vakt jarurat apni jadon kii ore lautne kaa rasta! vibhajit man kii granthiyaan! kuch kahaniyaan gahare jivananubhavon se nikali hai, kuch vyavastha kii visangatiyon se
 Somewhere in the language genre, there is an exploration of the cowardly aspirations of the inner from the psychological approach, somewhere the tone of satire-humor has been adopted on social squid
 adhikansh kahaniyaan pitrusattatmak samaaj ke mukhute utaar rudh naitikta ke vipaksh main khadi hai
 These stories, which inculcate the woman to test her own values, not only pose challenges to the male dominated society, but also stirs the thinking of the woman

 lukout notice ke bare main safai dete hue sibiai ne kaha ki iskaa makasad karti kii giraftaar katai nahin he
 Rather it is to prevent them from going abroad so that the evidence can be prevented from being tampered with or destroyed
 yani wo kanoon kii pahunch se dur naa ja saken or naa hi sabooton se chhedchhad kar saken
 On this, the Supreme Court also questioned that even the Madras High Court has arranged that Karti will tell the investigating officer three days before going abroad and if the CBI wants to put zeal on him, then what is the problem in this too
 is par eesg tushaar mehta ne kuch mohalat maangi taaki sibiai se is bindu par baatcheet kii ja sake
 On the other hand, Kapil Sibal said on behalf of Karthi that the government is not so helpless that someone goes on a foreign trip without his knowledge
 agar saboot itane hi pukhta hai to wo karti kaa passport jabt kyon nahin kar leti
 The government's malfeasance is behind this action of CBI against Karti and her family
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 9 aktubar ko hogi, yani tab tak to karti videsh nahin ja sakate hai
