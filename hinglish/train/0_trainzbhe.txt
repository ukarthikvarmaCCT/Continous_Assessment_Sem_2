 GATE 2018: kisaan ke bete ne chemistry main kiya ol india topkaise sarpanch ban gayi shahanajashahnaz ne ek website ko intervyuu dete hue bataaya ki 'mujhase pehle mere dadaji bhi yahaan se sarpanch the
 But in October last year, the court rejected that election
 jiske baad charchaa shuru hone lagi ki chunaav main koun khadaa hoga
 This man did not want to do the job, then the owner of crores made like this, he said that to contest the election of sarpanch in Rajasthan, tenth pass is mandatory
 shahanaz ke dadaji par sarpanch ke chunaav main farji shaikshanik yogyata kaa certificate dene kaa aarope tha, jiske baad kama kaa sarpanch chunaav radd kar diya gaya tha
 Please tell, the whole family of Shahnaz is in politics

 Father is the head of the village
 maa rajasthan se vidhayak, mantri or sansadeey sachiv rahi hai
 In such a situation, Shahnaz was named for the sarpanch election

 It is better if the state government takes strict legal action against such wrong elements

 Initial investigation found that the victim woman along with her grandson was buying goods from the shop

 When England came to the crease after being invited to bat first, skipper Alastair Cook (76), veteran Kevin Pietersen (76) and young Joe Root (57 not out) had a slow start and lost three wickets in the middle for ten runs
 Despite being successful in scoring 257 runs for seven wickets
 salaami ballebaaj ke taur par utre rohit ne 93 gend par 11 chaukon or ek chakke kii madad se 83 ran banaaye jabaki raina ne 79 gend par naabad 89 ran kii chamakdaar pari kheli jisamen nau chauke or ek chakka shaamil he
 India scored 47 with their big half-centuries
 3 over main paanch wicket par 258 ran banaaye
 In this way, India also repaid the defeat in the Test series

 India have their fourth consecutive win over England on home soil
 isse usne isisi vanade ranking main apni sthiti majboot kii
 India now has 120 rating points while England, who are in second place, are on 117 points
 rohit maukey kaa phayda uthaane ke liye patibaddh dikhe or is bich bhagya ne bhi unka saath diya
 Pietersen missed his easy catch when he was on 12

 He showed more speed after completing his 13th half-century with one run off Root's ball
 unhone tradewell kii gend par lagaataar chakka or chaukaa jamaaya
 He was firmly on his way to his third century, but Steven Finn lbw him to England's hopes
 dhoni or raina ne phir se jimmedaari sanbhali
 Meanwhile, some drama was also seen
 dhoni stump out hone se bache to fin kii galati se england ko raina kaa wicket nahin mila
 Raina caught the slip
 fin ne haalanki gendbaaji chor kii gilliyaan gira di thi or ampire steven davis ne ise ‘ded ball’ de diya
 Raina took advantage of this and sent Bresnan off the second slip for four runs to complete his 27th and his third consecutive half-century and hit two fours in the same bowler's next over
 captain mahendra singh dhoni (19) phinishing tach nahin de paye lekin raina tike rahe
 He hit a six over Bresnan while Ravindra Jadeja (21 not out) scored the winning run
 isse pehle cook or petersan ke bich duusare wicket ke liye 95 ran kii saajhedaari ke baavjood england 250 ran ke paar pahunchane kii sthiti main nahin dikh rahaa tha lekin root ne 45 gend kii apni pari main aath chauke or ek chakka lagaakar team ko achche score tak pahunchaaya
 India's new-ball bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shami Ahmed were initially getting movement, both of which upset Cook and Ian Bell (10)
 bharat ko pehali safalataa ishanth sharma ne dilaayi
 Bell played the shot without coming into the line of the ball and Bhuvneshwar dived over Thirdman and took a good catch
 petersan or cook ke bich saajhedaari aswin ne todi lekin tab ampire sudhir asanani kaa faisla sahi nahin tha
 The ball lbw out to Cook was pivoted outside the leg stump
 cook ne 106 gend kii pari main 13 chauke lagaaye
 Eoin Morgan (03) and Samit Patel (01) also returned to the pavilion early, taking the score to 132 for four from 132 runs for one wicket
 yadi kohli ne ishanth kii gend par slip main jo root kaa aasaan kaich nahin choda hota to england kii sthiti or kharaab hoti
 Root did not even open an account then
 petersan or root ne deth overon main teji se ran banaaye
 He targeted Ishant after Ashwin

 His 93-ball innings included seven fours and a six

 He completed his first ODI half-century by hitting Shami in the last over
 kendriya mantri shashi tharur ke saath vivaadon main aane vaali pakistani patrkaar meher taraar ne aaj kaha ki unki patni sunanda pushkar kii maut par vah ‘ekadam sakate’ main hai
 Tarar, a 45-year-old journalist from Lahore, tweeted after the news of Pushkar's death, 'what the hell
 
 Sunanda 
 o my god '
 ek anya twit main taraar ne kaha, main abhi uthi hum or yah padhane ko mila
 i am completely in the can
 bahut traasad he
 i don't know what to say ishwar sunanda kii aatma ko shanti de
 Unhappy over the alleged extramarital affair between Tharoor and Tarar, Pushkar was found dead in a five-star hotel, which police believe to be a case of suicide
 police sutron ke mutabik, 52 varshiya pushkar kaa shav lila pales hotel main rahasyamayi paristhitiyon main paaya gaya
 She married Tharoor in August 2010
 pichley do dinon main pushkar or tharur vivaadon main aa gaye the jab is tarah kii khabaren ain ki apane pati or taraar ke bich kathith taxt or twit maisejon se vah naakhush thi
 Tarar, the mother of a 13-year-old son, denied relations with Tharoor
 kya vah tharur ko jaanati hai, is par taraar ne kaha tha, bharat main ek saakshaatkaar ke liye pichley saal april main main unase mili thi
 This was followed by a ceremony in Dubai
 haa twitor or i-mail par unase sampark main rahi hum
 After the controversy surfaced, Tharoor had said in a joint statement with his wife that his married life is happy, but some have been troubled by illegal tweets
 pushkar ne taraar par apane pati kaa peechha karne or unka vivaah ‘todane’ kaa bhi aarope lagaaya, jab vah chikitsa upachaar kara rahi thi
 In the midst of the tweet, Pushkar also alleged that Tarar is an ISI agent
 taraar ne aaropon se inkaar kiya or unke khilaaf manahani kaa maamla daayar karne kii dhamkee di thi
 People living in Delhi are also looking very upset due to demonetisation, but people in Delhi's village Kheda are very happy

 Manju Verma has resigned but still his bungalow remains a matter of discussion
 sawaal uthta he aakhir kyon? iskaa jawaab bhi behad dilachasp he
 In fact, in the last few years, Strand Road bungalow number 6 has become a symbol of ill-will
 pichley kuch varshon main is bangale main jo bhi mantri rahane aayaa he usne apana kaarykaal puraa nahin kiya he
 It is being said here that the last 3 ministers who lived in this house, but they did not complete their tenure as a minister
 khaas baat yah he ki yah teenon netaa kushvaha jati se aate hai
 First of all, let's talk about JDU leader and Excise Minister Awadhesh Kushwaha who became a minister in 2010 and was allotted this bungalow but he was accused of taking bribe during the October 2015 assembly elections
 avadhesh kushvaha kaa paise lete hue video viral ho gaya jiske baad nitish kumaar ne unka istipha karavaaya
 Awadhesh Kushwaha had to resign from his post just 2 months before his term ended
 2015 vidhansabha chunaav main mahagathbandhan kii jeet hui or argedy cote se alok mehta sahakaarita mantri bane or unhen yah bangala aavantit hua
 Alok Mehta was able to remain a minister for only 18 months because last year Nitish Kumar broke away from the Grand Alliance and formed a government with the BJP and Alok Mehta could not complete his tenure while living in this bungalow
 alok mehta bhi kushvaha jati se aate hai
 Last year, after the formation of JDU-BJP government in the state, Kumari Manju Verma became the only minister in the Nitish cabinet and got the responsibility of Social Welfare Department
 mantri rahete hue manju verma ko bhi strand road kaa bangala number 6 aavantit kiya gaya magar unka hashr aakhirkaar kya hua yah sabko pataa he
 Manju Verma was also able to remain a minister for only 1 year and while living in this bungalow, she also did not complete her tenure

 The demand for Maratha reservation in Maharashtra is becoming violent
 rajya ke alag-alag ilaakon se hangaame or todphod kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 Meanwhile, a young man has committed suicide in Aurangabad
 maratha aarakshan kii maang ko lekar aurangabad main 35 saal ke ek vyakti ne chalati train ke saamne chalaang lagaakar kathith rup se aatmahatya kar lee
 Senior inspector of Mukundwadi police station Natha Jadhav told the news agency that Pramod Jaisingh Hoare had written on Facebook and whatsapp that he would give his life in support of the demand for reservation
 usne kal (ravivaar) raat yahaan mukundwari kshetra main chalati train ke saamne kathith rup se chalaang laga di
 According to a police officer, Jaisingh wrote on Facebook, 'today a Maratha is leaving
 
 
 
 
 
 
 lekin maratha aarakshan ke liye kuch kiijie
 'in preparation for the examination of Maharashtra Public Service Commission, Jutejyasinh wrote in another message,' Maratha reservation will kill one
 ' uske kai doston ne usase aisa nahin karne kaa anurodh kiya lekin usne kisi kii bhi nahin suni
 Jaisingh's body was found on the railway track on Monday morning
 uski khudakushi kii khabar sunakar badi sankhya main log uske ghar ke baahar ikattha ho gaye
 His family said that they will not raise the economy until the state government takes a final decision on the issue of reservation
 maharashtra main maratha samudaay aarakshan kii maang ko lekar andolan kar rahaa he
 According to Jadhav, Jai Singhmukundwadi ran a shop and his wife was Gramsevika
 is bich, aarakshan samarthak kaaryakartaaon ne apni maangon par dabaav banane ke liye jaalnaa road jam kar diya
 Like any teenage boy from Kolkata in the sixties, i also had a simple interest
 masalan, kavita, sex, aadhyatm or duniya ko badal dene kii joardaar chahat vagairah-vagairah
 But is this so? Probably not
 isliye main naksalbadi andolan ke ubhaar ke baari gahamagahami vaale dinon main presidency jaisaa behtareen college chhod aayaa or 17 saal kii umr main kavitaaon kii apni pehali kitaab puri kii
 Luckily, i met Anokhi Man, the founder of Writers' Workshop, P
W
 laal se ho gai
 He was known as a professor, poet, calligrapher and overall translator of the Mahabharata
 unhone meri kavitaaon kii kitaab chhaapi or agle kuch varshon tak meri sabhi kitaaben chhapate rahe
 i learned the art of translation from them, which later became intoxicating for me
 jab bhi mujhe lekhan se fursat milti, dusron ke kaam kaa anuwaad karne baith jaataa
 My own poems were also translated
 kuch anuwaad achche hai
 Shakti Chattopadhyay's translation is even better than my original poem
 aashcharya nahin kyonki ve khud bade kavi hai
 Some translations are worth forgetting
 par isse fark nahin padataa
 Like life, people remember only good poems
 kharaab kavitaayen bhula di jaati hai or ascharyajanak rup se unke liye maaf bhi kar diya jaataa he (tagore kii apni kavitaaon kaa bhayaavah anuwaad iskaa umdaa udhaaharan he)
 In Italy the translator is called the traitor
 yaa kahen ki anuwaad stri kii tarah he jo jitani sundar hogi, utani bevafa
 So, i translated my favorite Bangla and Urdu poems and poetry with complete infidelity
 pracheen sanskrit prem kavitaaon par bhi haath aajamaaya
 At the same time, a friend of mine, both Sanskrit scholar, who was older in age and understanding, took me aside and started saying that i should try the translation of Ishopanishad
 unhone isamen meri madad karne kaa vaada kiya
 In this way a new beginning occurred
 meraa pehla draft taiyaar hua to vah shastriji ko pasand aayaa
 But they did not agree with my way
 unhone shikaayat kii ki isamen tum khud bahut zyada dikhaai padate ho
 My answer was that if i am not allowed to reconstruct according to my feelings, then why should i scour the classics? It was the 1977 period and my temper was intact
 professor ko vah acha laga or ve use chhapana chaahate the
 i said no, i will work on it now
 saal bitate gaye
 The Isophanishad stood on my desk
 is bich maine doosraa kuch anuwaad kar daalaa
 The war of Bangladesh took place
 maine yuddh ke kaviyon kaa anuwaad kiya, jo apni bhashaa par jaan qurbaan karne ko taiyaar the
 Felix Topolski painted and was printed by the Sri Lankan poet Tambimuthu based in London
 vah bestceller sabit hui or yuddh ke prayaason ke liye dhan ikattha hua (40 saal baad pichley saal shaikh hasina sarkaar ne mujhe uske liye sammanit kiya)
 The Ishopanishad remained on my desk in the same way
 nahin, yah kahana sahi na hoga
 i would come back in it from time to time, but every time it would get changed
 lagbhag jaadui andaaj main kuch ekadam alag-sa lagane lagata
 But i was not ready to print it now
 aakhirkaar, mahatma (gandhi) ne kaha hi he ki agar ab tak likhe gaye sabhi shaastra nasht ho jaaen or ishopanishad bachaa rahe to duniya main kisi kii kami nahin khalegi
 The idea of expressing that elemental consciousness in another language was intimidating
 phir bhi chunauti se peeche hatana manjuur na tha
 Whenever i read the draft (it is a small Upanishad and it is easy to read it again and again), i think, i am doing something differently
 har baar padhgaye par mere dimag main nae vichaar kaundh jate
 When decorating those same sentences anew, something new was created
 main chakit tha: kya isi vajah se pracheen bauddhikta kii ore baar-baar lautne se hamen nae vichaar sujhte hai jo varshon se hamaare badalane ke saath badal jate hai?thik-thik kahen to mujhe kuch sujh nahin rahaa tha
 All i knew is that the Isophanishad is like a bizarre puzzle, which automatically presents a variety of solutions, but they are all different
 yah aap par he ki aap ise jivan ke kis mode par kaise dekhte hai
 Over the years i kept changing city, home, job, girlfriends and in the process, many friends, diaries, incomplete manuscripts were left behind, but this Upanishad was not left out
 pichley saal tak mere prakaashak dost naveen kishor kii salaah thi ki 2014 use puraa karne kaa acha varsh ho saktaa he
 What attracts the most in the Ishopanishad is that there is no religious thing at all
 har shabd, har vichaar aap jaise chahen apane se jod sakate hai
 It is like Surya Namaskar
 kuch log ise hindu shaastra kah sakate hai par vah itnaa hi hindu shaastra he jaise bharat kii hawa kii saans lenaa yaa ganga main dubkee lagaana
 For me it is like Google Maps of life
 kavita, sex, aadhyatm or duniya badalane kii akulaahat kaa kya hua? ve sabhi aaj bhi kaayam hai
 Probably not in that order anymore
 (lekhak or sampadak pritish nandi ne haal hi main ishopanishad kaa angreji main anuwaad kiya) After Prabhu Deva Dancer, he has made his mark as an actor and director in Hindi films too
 april main prabhu deva kii agali film aane ja rahi he

 The sound score of the film is also making this scene perfect

 " Important meeting of Sunni Waqf Board to be held in Lucknow today AIMPLB has announced to file a review petition
 The Sunni Waqf Board, the party in Ayodhya case, is going to meet in Lucknow on Tuesday
 yah baithak kaaphi ahm he kyonki aaj ye tay hoga ki sunni vakf board ol india muslim personal lau board ke rivyuu pitishan ke fisel ke saath jayega yaa nahin
 It will also decide whether the land that the Supreme Court has ordered to be given to the Sunni Waqf Board in lieu of the mosque is 5 acres
 sunni vakf board ke chairman jafar faruki pehle hi apni raay rakh chuke hai ki sunni vakf board ko supreme court kaa yah faisla maan lenaa chahie
 But Zafar Farooqui always seemed to say that the final decision will be decided in the Sunni Waqf Board meeting
 ol india muslim personal lau board ke rivyuu pitishan main jane ke baad ab sunni vakf board bhi do khemon main bant chukaa he
 One camp is openly in favor of going to the review petition, while many others are not in favor of taking the matter further
 haalanki jafar faruki kii baat se abdul rajjak khan or duusare sadsy ittefaq nahin rakhte
 According to them, the Sunni Waqf Board must go to the review because there are many contradictions in the Supreme Court's decision
 saath hi paanch acre jameen bhi nahin lee jaani chahie kyonki masjid ke evaj main duusari masjid nahin banaai ja sakati
 The mosque is forever
 sunni vakf board ke sadsy or samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak abraar ahamed kaa maananaa he ki rivyuu main jane se koi phayda nahin kyonki supreme court ne ek faisla de diya he jo cheez hamaari thi vah cheez todakar duusare ko de di gai
 Now going to the review is like being stupid
 unhone kaha ki rivyuu main nahin janaa chahie kyonki iskaa koi phayda nahin
 Please tell that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has announced to file a review petition on the Supreme Court's decision in the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case

 The notice of impeachment motion of the opposition against Chief Justice of India Deepak Mishra was rejected by Rajya Sabha Chairman vice-president m Venkaiah Naidu at an early stage
 vaise ye aisa pehla vakya nahin he
 Even before this, there have been failed attempts to impeach the judges

 Gupta accused Shah of being dishonest when the judge made some comments against him during a hearing
 baharhaal, spikar ne notice ko 'mahatvaheen' qaraar dekar khaarij kar diya tha
 There is another such case against CJI Mishra and Justice Shah apart from the cases of dismissal of the notice at an early stage

 Army Chief General VK Singh believes that the Supreme Court has not effectively closed the dispute related to his age
 haalanki, unhone apane istife kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya
 General Singh had to face defeat in a legal battle with the Ministry of Defense over the age dispute
 unhone kaha, ‘yah kahana beyimaani hogi ki mujhapar istipha dene kaa dabaav nahin tha
 Even my close advisors were influenced by the media's interpretation and yes, i was deeply disappointed that the Supreme Court did not effectively close the issue
 ’unhone kaha, ‘chif of army staff hone ke naate sena or uske karmiyon ke prati meri jimmedaari he or mujhe adhure kaaryon ko dekhnaa he jise maine apane liye nirdhaarit kiya he
 i cannot quit until i finish what i have started
 santhnik hit sarvocch hai
 General Singh said that many commentators saw this as a classic case of tension in civil-military relations and compared the incomplete resignation of General KS Thimaiya to predict his resignation
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke unke maamle ko barkaraar nahin rakhane par unke istife sambandhi atakalon ke sambandh main puche gaye sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘lekin main umr ko aisi cheez ke rup main dekhtaa hum jiskaa niraakaran mujhe or sena ko karnaa he or ek baar kanoonee vyavastha die jane par ham ise karenge
 General Singh said that the order of the apex court created more confusion without resolving the main issue
 vah vaidhanik shikaayat ko do hisson main baantne kii baat karti he, jisamen ek ore faisla karne kii prakriya or duusari ore uski vichaarneeyata shaamil he
 General Singh said, 'the Ministry of Defense said that since they have decided to set the year of my birth as 1950, i have to accept it under all circumstances
 yah naiysargik nyaay ke siddhant ke khilaaf he
 When asked if there was a perception that he had lost the legal battle and the Supreme Court had given an order against him, he said that it was a strange situation
 jab ucchtam nyaayalay maamle par sunwaayee kar rahaa tha to media main sunwaayee kii minute dar minute vyakhya kii ja rahi thi
 Breaking news and newspapers on TV gave their verdict in their headline the following day, declaring that the 'general has lost the battle
 ’general singh ne kaha ki jab 15 farvari ko aadesh aayaa to media ne ise report nahin kiya or sabane iske abhipraay par dhyaan nahin diya
 He said, 'this is a harmless order which leaves the matter of recognition of the date of birth on the competent authority based on the record
 media kaaphi badha-chadhaakar tippanee kii reporting kar rahaa tha
 Asked if his decision to withdraw his plea from the court led to the perception that he was satisfied with what the court said, General Singh said that his statutory complaint was rejected by the Ministry of Defense on December 30
 He later approached the court
 gat teen farvari ko adaalat ne nirnay lene kii prakriya par sawaal uthaaya jisaki vajah se ise thukraayaa gaya or yah raay di ki yah naiysargik nyaay ke siddhanton ke khilaaf he
 On 10 February last, the Attorney General withdrew the Defense Ministry's order against the statutory complaint and silently accepted that the actual date of birth was 1951 and the Ministry is only opposing in principle
 general singh ne kaha ki chunki adaalat main or kuch bhi nahin kaha janaa tha or khaastaur par nyaayadhishon ne is baat kaa bhi sanket diya tha ki adaalat vaastavik janmatithi ke maamle main padana nahin chaahati
 He said, "now, until the decision-making process of the Ministry of Defense is explained, in which the rationale behind determining my date of birth 1950 is clear, how can i challenge it?" isliye maine apni yachika waapas lee or emodi (raksha mantralay) ke nae sire se kaaran bataane kaa intjaar karne kaa faisla kiya he
 He said that the important thing is to arrange that such cases should never be repeated in future
 janmatithi vivaad main purv sena pramukh general je je singh kaa haath hone kii ore ishaara karne vaale unki putree kii ore se likhe gaye lekh ke bare main unki raay puche jane par general singh ne sidhaa uttar nahin diya
 He just said that the problem escalated when the Ministry of Defense chose to 'support this opinion' without investigating why it is being done
 ’ yah puche jane par ki kya aap yah kah rahe hai ki 2006 kaa faisla (je je singh dwaara kiya gaya) avaidh tha to isapar general singh ne kaha, ‘iske apane prabhaav hai
 If i say that i do not challenge it, it cannot be enforced because the court order does not say anything on the validity of two different dates of birth
 ’yah puche jane par ki aisa laga ki aap pratishthan ke khilaaf khadaa hone vaale vyakti ke taur par dikhe unhone kaha, ‘bhartiya sena kaa pramukh hone ke naate main janata kii raay se batch nahin saktaa or main is baat se waakif hum ki main raksha mantralay main ladaai ko le jane main galat tha

 He has claimed that Modi has changed the heart of the Muslims of Gujarat with his 'model of development and social security' and in the same way he will be able to change the heart of the Muslims of the entire country
 ansaari ne kaha, ‘muslim samudaay or bijepi ke bich jo duuri he, use khatm karne ke liye party ke har kaaryakarta ko jamini str par mehnat kerani chahie
 Misconceptions have been spread in this community about the work and ideology of the party and we must remove these misconceptions
 mujhe khushi he ki haal ke saalon main bijepi or muslim samudaay ke bich faasale kam hue hai
 Asked whether the Muslims of the country would accept Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, Ansari said, "there must have been a share of the Muslims in Gujarat's development, only then they changed their hearts
" hamen puri ummid he ki unako lekar puure desh ke musalamaanon kaa dil badalegaa
 The most important point is their development model and social security
 yahi baaten sabhi ko jod rahi hai
 In the context of the demand to declare Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, Ansari said, "modi has proved himself as a popular leader through development
" meraa maananaa he ki party jise bhi pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaati he, vah desh kaa netritv karne main puri tarah sakasham hoga
 Asked about the perceived image of bjp's communalism, Ansari said, "our ideology is to take everyone along
" vaise dharmanirpekshata kisi ek dal kii thekedaari nahin ho sakati
 He said that we are trying from our level to connect the Muslim community with the party in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 musalmaan congress or duusare dalon ko samaj chukaa he
 Things have changed and people's thinking has changed
 hamaari vichaardhaara ko lekar jo galatchhemiyaan failaai gai hai, ham unhen dur karne kii koshish karenge
 ' uttarakhand se lekar upi or goa se manipur main alag-alag dalon ke netaa party chhod bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 This sequence has already started in Delhi before the MCD elections
 bijepi ke satta ke rath main duusari party ke netaaon kii sawari lagaataar najar aa rahi he
 Somewhere before the election, somewhere on the occasion of the election, somewhere after the election, rebel leaders of other parties continue to join the BJP
 chaahe vah netaa apni party main kitna hi bada kyon naa ho, netaaon ko ab apana bhavishya bijepi main surakshit dikh rahaa he
 All the leaders want close proximity to the ruling BJP at the Center or say that the party president Amit Shah's strategy is working behind getting the other party's strong leaders to join the BJP
 jo bhi netaa duusari party se aayega wo kuch na kuch vot apane saath laaegaa, kyonki unka vyaktigat vot bank bhi hota he
 Due to which the votes will increase in the party and a message will also be given that the leader often leaves the losing party
 vah jeetne vaale kii taraf jate hai to netaaon ke aane se janata ko yah lagegaa ki bijepi jeetne vaali party he or bhavishya bhi isi kaa he
 However, the opposition is not taking the strategy of including the BJP in this way and putting it in the dock
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki bijepi aise netaaon ko apni party main shaamil karvaa rahi he jinpar pehle se hi bhrashtachar ke aarope hai
 Despite this, the BJP calls itself a corruption-free party
 ise kahin naa kahin bijepi main bhi aturata dikhti he
 How many big things should BJP say that it is a very big and strong party, their popularity has increased, but with the help of other party leaders, they want to win the election
 vipaksh yah bhi yaad dilaataa he ki kaise uttar pradesh main bijepi ne congress ke pradesh adhyaksh rahi reeta bahuguna ko chunaav jeetne kii khatir party main shaamil kiya
 Rita Bahuguna has been a staunch opponent of the BJP at one time
 bijepi ke netaa or reeta bahuguna ek duusare ko dheron gaaliyaan diya karte the
 SM Krishna, considered a Congress loyalist for decades, is also included in this list
 karnataka main jinke mukhyamantri rahete bijepi ne un par bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jhadi laga di thi
 Even when he had read the speech of the minister of another country while the foreign minister
 unki bhul kaa pradhanmantri modi ne khub majaak udaaya tha
 Now the same SM Krishna is part of the BJP family
 bijepi kii is ranneeti ko bhi karnataka ke aane vaale chunaav se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Alleging corruption charges against former Uttarakhand CM Vijay Bahuguna, the BJP had demanded his resignation from the Chief Minister and also strongly protested
 lekin usee vijay bahuguna ko uttarakhand chunaav ke pehle party main shaamil karavaaya or unke bete ko tikat bhi diya
 Similarly, the BJP also tried to ensure victory in Uttarakhand by including other Congress leader in Uttarakhand Harak Singh Rawat and former Pradesh Congress President Yashpal Arya
 goa main jab bijepi ko chunaav main bahumat nahin mila to duusari party ke netaaon ke sahaara lekar sarkaar banaai
 Not only this, former Congress chief minister Pratap Singh Rane, who was always on the bjp's target
 unke vidhayak bete ko pehle vidhayak pad se istipha dilvaaya
 Which reduces the number of Congress and gives BJP an absolute majority in the House
 baad main bijepi ne vishwajit rane ko bhi apana bana liya
 Now the MCD election is in the head in Delhi, Sheila has been a minister in the government and party's state president Arvinder Singh Lovely has been joined by Amit Shah in the BJP
 yah vahi lavali he jinke shiksha mantri rahete bijepi bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaati thi or aae din lavali pradesh adhyaksh ke taur par bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate rahen
 Now BJP is also eyeing other state leaders of Congress
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhi bijepi kii yahi ranneeti chali thi jisamen vah safal hui thi
 Similarly, on the state-wise strategy, the BJP went ahead and got success
 bihar main jarur bijepi kii ranneeti ko palitha laga tha, vahaan par vipaksh ekajute ho gaya tha
 Despite all this, Amit Shah is a master of organization and electoral strategy
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi chunavi ranneeti ko lekar amit shah kii peeth thapthapai he
 State-wise, they are moving forward on this strategy and they believe that the BJP family will grow from whoever joins the party
 shaayad isi tarj par vipaksh ko bihar kii yaad aati he or 2019 ke madadenjar maha gathbandhan kii awaajen aaj kal raajnneeti kii galiyaaron main baar-baar gunj rahi hai
 There is a new twist in the CD scandal in Delhi
 sidi main dilli sarkaar ke barkhaast mantri sandip kumaar ke saath dikh rahi mahila ne thane pahunchakar unke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kara diya he
 After which the accused MLA Sandeep Kumar, seeing himself being surrounded all-round in the case, has surrendered by reaching the DCP office in outer Delhi
 mahila kaa aarope he ki sandip ne use nashila cold drink pilaakar uske saath duraachaar kiya tha
 AAP leader and former minister of Delhi government, Sandeep Kumar, has increased difficulties
 sidi main unke saath dikh rahi mahila ne saamne aakar sandip ke khilaaf maamla darj karaayaa he
 The woman reached Sultanpuri police station in Delhi on Saturday and lodged a case against AAP leader Sandeep for raping her
 abhi tak sidi cond main dikh rahi mahila ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin mil pai thi
 But now due to the presence of the woman, there is a big problem for Sandeep Kumar
 sandip ke sir par ab giraftaar kii talwaar latak rahi he
 It is believed that the police can arrest them anytime
 mahila kaa aarope he ki vah rashan card banavaane kii khatir aap vidhayak sandip kumaar ke paas gai thi
 Then Sandeep Kumar gave the woman a drink of cold drink after adding the intoxicating substance
 uske baad vahaan uske saath jo kuch bhi hua use pataa nahin chalaa
 When he regained consciousness, he understood the whole matter
 gauratlab he ki dilli police kii krime branch ne dilli ke barkhaast mantri sandip kumaar ke 'sidi cond' kii jaanch kaa kaam shuukravaar ko shuru kar diya tha
 Crime Branch joint CP Ravindra Yadav has given the responsibility of investigating this case to a special team
 is team kaa netritv ek disipi kar rahe hai
 Police sources say that sacked minister Sandeep Kumar may be called for questioning to find out the truth of the alleged sex CD, but before that the police will examine all the photographs and videos, in which Sandeep Kumar is seen in intimate moments with women
 Are coming sidi kii forensikjanchabhi karai jaaegi
 Although Sandeep Kumar has denied being in the CD himself, but now the police have to do the job of getting to the bottom of the truth
 police ko sabase pehle yah pataa lagaana he ki media tak sidi pahunchane vaale shaks ke paas sidi kahaan se ai, ye video kahaan bani, kab bani, kisne banaai, baahar kaise ai? ye saare sawaal police ke saamne hai
 a Delhi Police official said that the outline of the investigation will be decided on Friday
 bataate chalem ki guuruuvaar bhaajapa netaaon ne police kamishnar alok verma se milakar sidi cond kii jaanch karaane kii maang kii thi
 He had accused Sandeep Kumar of sexual exploitation of women by misusing his ministerial position
 kamishnar ne unki shikaayat kii jaanch krime branch ko saunp di he
 Democracy is like a plant which needs constant care
 ye baat dilli main shuukravaar se shuru hue india today conklev main india today group ke editor in chif arun puri ne kaha
 On this occasion, Arun Puri said that the conclave is also part of the same process and when so many celebrities are together on one stage, then the dreams of 21st century India will also come true
 unhone kaha ki pichley 11 saalon main desh main kai bade badlaav hue
 But i am sure that you must also believe that India is not just one country
 balki yah duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr he jahaan teji se badlaav ho rahe hai
 As a nation, we have surprised everyone, where the best and worst trends of democracy exist simultaneously
 hamaare jaise khabaron kii duniya ke logon ke liye har pal romaanch se bharpoor rahaa
 But how it was for the country is difficult to say
 unhone bataaya ki pichley 11 saal se lagaataar yojit kiye ja rahe india today conkalev main 21 veen sadi main lokatrant ke vikaas or samay ke saath badalte ahm muddon par vichaar hota rahaa he
 This year also the Conclave will continue to discuss the changing dimensions of democracy with eminent speakers
 is saal kii theme he: rienvinting demokrasi (reinventing Democracy)
 There could be no better topic than this for democracy and in the era of struggle within democracy
 21 veen sadi main madhya purv main loktantr ke liye dardanaak ladaai or arab main loktantr kii ladaai ne chetavanee de di ki loktantric swatantraaa chaah behad sankramak he
 This struggle for democracy is not over yet and even in the spring of the season of romance, democracy still does not have complete independence
 is maukey par unhone loktantr ko lokar desh or videsh kii ghatnaon kii ore bhi logon kaa dhyaan khinchaa
 Blood is still being shed in Libya and Syria and the whole world is watching
 misr main taanaashaahee ke baad bhi loktantr main jivan behatar nahin he
 It is a fact that maintaining the democratic system is more difficult than fighting for democracy
 jahaan duniya main ek ore loktantr ke liye sangharsh jari he, vahiin duniya ke bade loktantr sankat ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 Governments in Europe strive to save the single currency from collapse and revive their economies

 Why did he take such a dangerous route of attack, in which his officers could be trapped in Pakistan

 Significantly, Air India incurred a huge loss of Rs 8,400 crore in the financial year 2018-19

 ek tukdaa mitti or muththi bhar ghaas kii qeemat bhala kya ho sakati he
 If we say - more than 8 lakh rupees, then you are shocked
 lekin jis mahaan shakhsiyat kii yaaden usase judi hai, uski darasal koi qeemat lagaai hi nahin ja sakati
 It is being talked about whose signs of Mahatma Gandhi were auctioned at more than 57 lakhs
 muththi bhar mitti or sukhi ghaas ke chand katare, qeemat 8 lakh 19 hazaar 104 rupye
 Grass and soil cost so much! You know why, because this soil has a blood of a historical man
 ghaas ke kataron se jhaank rahi he ek yugapurush kii aakiri saans
 64 years have passed since that unfortunate moment when the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was shot and killed
 baapu kaa koon jahaan gira, vahaan kii mitti or ghaas bhi bazaar kii laalchee nigahon se batch nahin pain
 As far as this soil is concerned, everything depends on your perspective
 kai logon ke liye ye maamuli mitti ho sakati he jisaki raddi se zyaada qeemat nahin
 But for some people it is a sacred sign that is undoubtedly valuable
 lihaaza, in chizon kii qeemat lagaana mushkil hi nahin, balki naammumkin he
 With the blood of Mahatma Gandhi, the sunny holy soil was auctioned in the same country, which held India in the chains of slavery for 200 years
 is nilaamee main baapu ke chashme or charake kii bhi boli lagi
 Bapu's blood stained with mud in London's Mulocks auction house and the house was auctioned for 10 thousand pounds ie 8 lakh 19 thousand 104 rupees

 baapu se judi ye chizein kis shaks ne khridin, iskaa kulasa nahin kiya gaya
 When the Mulox auction house announced the auction of these things, many voices were raised against it

 Incidents of assault between doctors and patients are common throughout the country, but on Monday, what happened at Patna AIIMS, the patients were shocked
 darasal, patna ames main doctor hi aapas main bhid gaye
 The incident was later reported to the police
 maukey par pahunchi police ne praathmiki darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 The police investigation so far has revealed that the fight took place between Dr
 Shailesh Mukul, a former head of the Dental Department and Dr
 Veena
 is ghatana main doctor vinaa ke saath kuch anya doctor bhi shaamil the
 Police is currently investigating the entire case
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki jhagade kii mukhya vajah doctor shailesh mukul dwaara bheja gaya vah mail he jisamen unhone apane mahila sahyogiyon par aapattijanak aarope lagaae the
 a warrant for his arrest was also issued on this basis, but he got bail in the meantime
 patna main doctors kii marpet yaa gundgardee kii yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he
 Shortly before, a group of junior doctors at IGIMS in Patna landed on hooliganism
 in junior doctors ne ek pulicekarmi ke saath marpet kii thi
 Actually, the soldier posted in IGMS Anil Kumar stopped a junior doctor going on a bike without a helmet, then the whole group started fighting
 tasveeron main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki kuch chaatr pulisavaale kii pitayee karne ke baad use ghasitate hue le gaye the
 Please tell that it is mandatory for a person sitting behind a bike in Patna to wear a helmet
 in logon ne na keval police karmi kii pitayee kii thi balki aspataal main kaamkaaj bhi thap kar diya tha
 Because of this, the patients present there had to face a lot of difficulties
 police ne is maamle main kuch aaropee chaatro ko hiraasat main liya thaor maamle kii jaanch kar rahi thi
 On this incident, the police had said that strict action will be taken against those who are guilty

 As soon as Priyanka Gandhi stepped into active politics, Congress leaders and workers were filled with enthusiasm
 priyanka kii siyaasi laanching ke liye 10 farvari ko lakhanu ke ramabai maidan main hone vaali raily ko thande baste main daal diya gaya he
 However, she returned to India from abroad on Monday and now under the changed strategy new plans are being made for her in Uttar Pradesh
 mana ja rahaa he ki kumbh ke snaan ke saath priyanka kaa soobe kaa daura shuru ho saktaa he
 If sources of Congress are to be believed then the proposed rally of Ramabai Maidan in Lucknow on February 10 has been canceled
 lekin ab nae plan ke tahat uttar pradesh main priyanka gandhi kii laanching prayagraj ke kumbh snaan ke saath shuru karne kii yojana banaai gai he
 Under this, Priyanka Gandhi will soon visit UP
 is kadi main wo pehle elahabaad main anand bhawan jaaengi, iske baad vahaan se kumbh snaan karne ja sakati hai
 Can meet in Lucknow, Priyanka will come to Lucknow after taking a dip in Kumbh
 yahaan wo congress mukhyalay main party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke saath badi baithak kar sakati he
 With this, the party will inaugurate the new conference hall to be built at the headquarters
 priyanka ke kumbh snaan ko soft hindutv card ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, his Kumbh Snan is being considered as a strategy to get around half a dozen Lok Sabha seats in Prayagraj
 prayagraj se satee hui elahabaad, phulpur, pratapgarh, kaushambi, bhadohi or machhlishahar loksabhaa siten hai
 Let me tell you that on January 23, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had given the responsibility of Purvanchal by making Priyanka Gandhi the national general secretary of the party
 iske saath hi jyotiraditya sindhiya ko pashchim upi kii kaman di gai he
 Priyanka's political entry is being described as the master stroke of the Congress
 uttar pradesh congress ne 10 farvari ke liye ramabai maidan ko book kar rakhaa tha
 The discussion was that Priyanka's launching in the state will be done with a big congress rally at Ramabai Maidan, but this plan has changed and now a new plan is being prepared
 priyanka par purvanchal kaa prabharpriyanka gandhi ko uttar pradesh ke purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi gai gai he, is purvanchal ke hisse main avadh or nichle doaab ilaake bhi shaamil he
 It has 42 Lok Sabha seats in nine circles
 purvi uttar pradesh brahmanon ke lihaaj se sabase bada ilaaka he or yahi vajah he ki congress ke liye mufeed mana ja rahaa he
 In fact, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when the Congress had won 21 seats from the state, it had 18 seats in these areas
 1984 ke baad congress ko uttar pradesh sabase zyada siten thi
 Uttar Pradesh has about 10 to 12 per cent Brahmin voters
 pradesh kii 20 se 25 loksabhaa siton par sidhe taur par ye matadaata nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 The Brahmins were formerly supporters of the traditional Congress, but after the Mandal movement, they leaned towards the BJP and later a large section of the Brahmin voters also leaned towards Mayawati's BSP
 lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav bijepi ke saath ekamusth chalaa gaya he
 Priyanka Gandhi will first have the important responsibility of connecting this class with herself
 is tarah se agar brahman congress kii taraf rukh karata he to phir party kii duusari ranneeti muslim or dalit matadaataaon ko apane saath jodne kii hogi
 This responsibility will be on the shoulders of Priyanka Gandhi
 priyanka gandhi kaa kumbh snaan kaa plan kaaphi kuch isi votbank ko jodne kaa hissaa he
 If the Congress succeeds on this strategy, the political equations of both the BJP and the SP-BSP alliance can collapse
 uttar pradesh ke congressi kaaphi samay se siyaasi sookhaa jhel rahe hai or priyanka gandhi ke aane maatr se jamini str ke party kaaryakartaaon main kaaphi utsaah dekha ja rahaa he
 The strong seats of the Congress in the state have already started showing as a poster war, in such a situation, how successful Priyanka's card is for the Congress will be known in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 yah aisa chalan he jo bhavi pidiyon par vyapak asar chodta he or unhen ek aise maansik avsaad main chhod detaa he jahaan se waapas aana sambhav nahin hota
 In such a situation, the students should also be told about the loss of ragging

 com / pprajrdzcc— ICC (@icc)september 17, 2019aswin dakshin africa ke khilaaf maujuuda test siries ke 15 sadasyeey bhartiya squad main shaamil hai
 But it is not decided whether he will get a chance in the last-11 players of Team India in the Test series starting on 2 October
 lagaataar paanch test maichon se baahar hai ashvithasvin lagaataar paanch test se baahar he
 Last played in the first match of the border-gavaskar Trophy in Australia
 disambar main edilade test main kul chah wicket (3+3) lene ke baad match kii chauthi subah chotil ho gaye
 He also did not play in the Perth and Melbourne Test after that due to a left abdominal strain
 sidney main hone vaale antim test ke liye 13 khilaadiyon main bhi unka naam rahaa, par unhen nahin khilaayaa gaya
 After this, he remained out of both Tests in the West Indies tour
 
 
 
 The only reason in favor of jadejajadeja who overshadowed such Ashwin could possibly be considered his continuity
 pichley saal disambar main aswin ke chotil hone kii vajah se baayen haath ke spinner jadeja ne australia main siries ke aakhri do test (melbern or sidney) maiche khele the
 In Melbourne, Jadeja conceded only 45 runs in 25 overs and took two wickets
 duusari pari main 32 overon kii gendbaaji main unhone 3 wicket chatkaaye
 And then concluded the series with a bowling analysis of 32–11–73–2 in Sydney
 westeindies siries ke do test maichon main jadeja ne kul 6 wicket chatkaaye or balle se ek ardhashatak bhi jamaaya
 The Champions Trophy-2017 failure took the place! In fact, in the Champions Trophy-2017, the spin duo of Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja could not do any good
 aswin us toornament ke dauraan teen maichon main sirf ek wicket le paae the
 Moreover, both the performances against Pakistan in the final were extremely poor
 donon ne 18 overon main 137 ran die or ek bhi wicket nahin mila
 After this, Ashwin got a bad start, while Ashwin managed to make a comeback
 aswin ko IPL ne world cricket main dilaai thi pahachaasvin kii ipel (indian premier lig) se pahchaan bani thi
 The tall bowler not only launched the Chennai Super Kings attack, but was also involved in the Death Overs
 south africa main kheli gai 2010 kii champiens lig tii-20 main aswin 'main of da siries' rahe
 Sharp bowling in T20 gave him a place in the Indian team
 bhajji ke girte graph ne aswin ko mauka dilaa diyajun 2010 main pehle to vanade main mauka mila or uske baad november 2011 main test cricket main bhi debyue kar liya
 Ashwin was included in the 2011 World Cup winning Indian squad, but he did not get much opportunities during Harbhajan Singh, but Ashwin worked hard on his bowling
 aakhirkaar harbhajan ke pradarshan ke girte graph ne aswin ko tavajjo dilaa di

 After India Today's sting operation on fake encounter in Uttar Pradesh till date, former Chief Minister of the state Akhilesh Yadav has asked the Yogi government to clarify that the law and order of UP is not taking care of this government
 purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne yogi sarkaar ko gherte hue kaha he ki vah pehle din se yahi baat kah rahe hai
 After all, who are those people who are paying for the encounter? The government should come out and tell the truth about it

 If this happens in a democracy then no one will be safe

 purv koyala sachiv pisi paarekh ne sevanivritti ke baad teen nijee companiyon ke liye kaam kiya tha jisamen se ek company koyala blaak hasil karne ke maamle main jaanch ke daayre main he
 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered an FIR against PC Parekh in the coal mine allocation case to Hindalco
 company maamalon ke mantralay ke paas uplabdh soochna ke mutabik, disambar, 2005 main sevanivrutt hue paarekh 26 farvari, 2007 ko navabharat power privet limited main bataur nideshak shaamil hue

 Navbharat sold the company's stake to Essar in 2010 after a coal block was allotted and is now under CBI probe
 vija power ne bhi ek koyala blaak ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Parekh said, "the company (navabharat Power) has nothing to do with coal block allocation as my director
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘meraa in companiyon ko koyala blaak aabantan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 If the CBI has any information, let them take the investigation proceedings and file a charge sheet
 ’ When asked about his tenure in these companies, Parekh said, 'allotments were not made during my tenure and during the period i was with these companies, i was not even aware of their applications and their allotment

K
 chidambaram 2ji spectrum license aavanton se puri tarah avgat the or unhone tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri e raja ke saath inaki nilaamee nahin karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Appealing on behalf of Kanimozhi, senior advocate Sushil Kumar told Special CBI Judge OP Saini, "I am providing you the details of the meeting in which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, then Finance Minister and Telecom Minister decided that 2G spectrum licenses Sale will not be auctioned
 ’maamle se aropamukt kiye jane kii maang karte hue 43 varshiya dramuk saansad ke vakil ne kaha ki sibiai kaa maamla is baat par aadhaarit he ki 2ji spectrum ke liye licenson kii nilaamee nahin kar aaropee ne sarkari khajaane ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Kumar said, 'the prime minister, the then finance minister and the current telecom minister, are the' right people 'to prove as witnesses that no harm was done
 unhone sansad main kaha tha ki koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 Adding that what the CBI case hinges on does not lead to a legal process, Kumar said, "if there is no loss, then there will not be an allegation of fraud
" ’bachaav paksh ke vakil ne sibiai or mahaniyantrak evam lekha pareekshak (kaig) ke nuksaan ke akalan ko bhi niraadhaar bataaya or kaha ki ye aaropee par mukadmaa chalaane kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakate
 The lawyer said, 'CAG report (1 to the government treasury)
 76 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan) sadan ke samaksh 16 navambar 2010 ko rakhi gai
 This was not accepted by the House
 yah ab bhi anishchit he ki sadan report ko sweekaar karegaa
 Kanimozhi's lawyer also questioned the cbi's assessment of the loss of Rs 30,984 crore and said that there is no basis for it as the charge sheet said that the government could have earned more by auctioning the licenses
 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne kaha, ‘ye shabd mukademe kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakate kyonki aarope patr main upyukt para (ek) purna myth he
 'he argued,' Swan Telecom Private Limited and Unitech Wireless Tamil Nadu Private Limited (both alleged beneficiaries of the scam) were approved by the government for the sale of shares to foreign companies Etisalat and Telenor respectively
 yah licenson kii bikri nahin thi or isliye koi nuksaan nahin hua
 The lawyer appearing for DMK chief m Karunanidhi's daughter asked, "where did the sale (of licenses) take place?" Where was the fraud? ’kanimozhi was arrested by the CBI on 30 May for his alleged role in the scam
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon or dhokhadhadi tathaa 2ji maamle main aapraadhik shadyantr ke aaropon ke virodh main unke tark ab bhi jari hai
 Kanimozhi is making the same arguments to absolve himself of the charges as former Telecom Minister a Raja had given
 unhone bhi yah kahkar maamle main pradhanmantri or chidambaram ko ghaseetne kii maang kii thi ki spectrum licensodharakon dwaara hissedari kam kiye jane ke mudde par unke saath charchaa kii gai thi

 However, sources associated with the Ministry of Home Affairs say that many more governors may also resign
 isse pehle khabar ai thi ki centre kii modi sarkaar ne congress ke samay niyukt kiye gaye lagbhag aadha darjan rajyapalon ko apane pad se hatane ke liye kaha tha
 It is believed that BL Joshi has resigned under this

 Sheila Dixit is said to have refused to resign

 BJP MP BP Singhal went to court on this issue

 But the court also said that the Central Government should write to the President giving reasons for the removal of such governors, who will keep or remove them as they wish
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki sarkaar in rajyapalon ko hataane par amada he or iske liye cabinet apni anushansa de sakati he

 It is noteworthy that the state assembly passed the bill on reservation for five castes including Gurjars on Wednesday

 But the Gurjar leaders wanted an assurance in writing from the government that if the bill is challenged legally, the government will support them

 a lot is happening in the politics of Bihar, which creates a new political speculation every day
 
 
 khaskar kya mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke apane puraane sambandhi or vartmaan virdohi bijepi se sambandh madhur ho rahe hai
 In the latest development, Janata Dal United has announced to invite BJP leaders to the banquet of Makar Sakranti festival on 15 January
 ukt ghoshnaa har saal is bhoj ke aayojak or bihar janata dal united ke adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne aaj patna main kii
 According to Singh, invitation is also being sent to BJP leaders this year
 singh ke is bhoj main chuda, dahi, tilkut, mithai ke alaava sabji hoti he
 It is believed that Singh made this announcement after Nitish's consent
 haalanki makar sankranti ke avasar par rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ke ghar par bhi bhoj kaa aayojan hota he
 This year too, Lalu has already sent invitations to everyone through the media
 yah bhi tay he ki nitish apane bhoj ke pehle lalu yadav ke ghar jaaenge
 Till now the practice has been that Nitish's banquet consists of power allies and Lalu's banquet as his political friends
 lekin yah pehali baar he ki apane rajnatik virdohi ko bhi bhoj main aamantrit kiya gaya he
 However, Bihar BJP president Nityanand Roy says that the invitation has not been received yet and he too is getting information through the media
 jab nimantrann milegaa tab shaamil hone kaa faisla liya jayega
 It is clear from this that Nityanand will decide whether or not to join the banquet on the instructions of the party high command
 tippaniyan In recent times, this invitation is being called another link in connection with the growing sweetness in the relationship between Nitish and BJP
 pichley dinon bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah jab patna aae tab unhone nitish yaa rajya sarkaar par kisi tarah kaa coment nahin kiya tha
 Political observers believe that Nitish Kumar's decision to participate in a human chain on January 21 on the issue of prohibition was also of the central leadership
 bijepi ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne prakaash utsav ke maukey par sharabbandi ke faisle kaa jaise samarthan kiya uske baad khatas kii gunjaaish or kam ho gai he
 However, Nitish rejected the Centre's questionnaire on the issue of uniform civil code and wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Law Commission and pointed out its flaws
 nimantran kii nai raajnneeti ke baad nishchit rup se is saal patna main hone vaale makar sankranti ke bhoj par puure desh ke logon kii najar hogi
 The announcement was made every year by the organizer of this banquet and the president of Bihar Janata Dal United, Vasishtha Narayan Singh in Patna today
 singh ke anusaar is saal bijepi netaaon ko bhi nimantran bheja ja rahaa he
 This banquet of lion includes chuda, curd, tilkut, sweets and vegetables
 mana ja rahaa he ki singh ne yah ghoshnaa nitish kii sahmati ke baad kii he
 However, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti, a banquet is also organized at the home of Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav
 is saal bhi lalu ne pehle se sabko media ke madhyam se nimantran bheja he
 It is also certain that Nitish will go to Lalu Yadav's house before his feast
 abhi tak yahi paripati rahi he ki nitish ke bhoj main satta ke sahyogi shaamil hote hai or lalu ke bhoj main unke rajnatik mitra
 But this is the first time that his political opponent has also been invited to the banquet
 haalanki bihar bijepi ke adhyaksh nityanand roy kaa kahana he ki abhi tak nimantran nahin mila he or unhen bhi media ke madhyam se jaankaree mil rahi he
 When the invitation is received, a decision will be taken to join
 isse spasht he ki nityanand party alaakaman ke nirdesh par hi bhoj main shaamil hone yaa na hone kaa faisla lenge
 The comments haal ke dinon main nitish or bijepi ke sambandhon main badhati madhurata ke silsile main is nimantran ko ek or kadi bataaya ja rahaa he
 Recently, when BJP national president Amit Shah came to Patna, he did not comment on Nitish or the state government
 rajnatik prekshkon kaa maananaa he ki nitish kumaar ke sharabbandi ke mudde par 21 janvari ko maanav shrinkhalaa main bhaag lene kaa faisla bhi kendriya netritv kaa tha
 BJP leaders say that after Prime Minister Narendra Modi supported the decision of prohibition of prohibition on the occasion of Prakash Utsav, the scope of sourness has further reduced
 haalanki nitish ne unifarm civil code ke masale par centre kii prashnawali ko khaarij kar diya or lau kamishan ke adhyaksh ko patr likhakar uski khamiyaan gina di thim
 After the new politics of invitation, the people of the entire country will certainly have their eyes on the Makar Sankranti banquet to be held in Patna this year
 haalanki makar sankranti ke avasar par rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ke ghar par bhi bhoj kaa aayojan hota he
 This year too, Lalu has already sent invitations to everyone through the media
 yah bhi tay he ki nitish apane bhoj ke pehle lalu yadav ke ghar jaaenge

 bjp's CM candidate in Karnataka BS Yeddyurappa wants a free hand in deciding the election strategy
 parivartan yatra par chal rahe yediurppa rajya ke mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ko lekar rajya ke baahar ke bhaajapa netaaon kii tippanee ko lekar asahaj bataae ja rahe hai
 It is worth noting that recently Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had launched a political attack on Siddaramaiah in Karnataka
 iske baad bhaajapa adhyaksh ne bhi siddharmaiya par isi tarah kii tippanee kii thi
 According to information received from Yeddyurappa's close leaders, Yeddyurappa is uncomfortable with it
 mukhyamantri apane upar ho rahe siyaasi hamale ko bahari banaam sthaneey kaa mudda banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But criticism from both the bjp's top leaders, party president Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath, appears to be a personal attack on Siddaramaiah more than the state government
 sutron kaa kahana he ki yediurppa ne is baat ke sanket kendriya netaaon ko diya he
 Yeddyurappa wants to focus on highlighting the achievements of Yeddyurappa's time by highlighting the failures of the state government until his Parivartan Yatra is over by January 28
 is tarah sattavirohi rujhaan ko ek mudda ke rup main pehle sthapit kiya jaae
 Then personal attacks can be made to make it bigger

 Accused delaying by alternating petitions: The lawyers government agency is sleeping in its Kumbhkaran: All eyes are on the hearing on December 13 in the Zhanibharia gang rape case
 aise main nirbhaya ko jald faansee dilaane kii arji par bahes karne vaale vakil jitendra jha kaa kahana he ki agar system dhang se kaam karen to maheene bhar ke bheetar nirbhaya ke doshiyon ko faansee par latakaaya ja saktaa he
 Advocate Jitendra Jha, who was arguing on the Nirbhaya case, told Aaj Tak's correspondent Poonam Sharma that Nirbhaya's convicts can be hanged within a month if the system works properly
 pichley saal july main supreme court se sabhi kii apil khaarij ho gai thi, uske baad teen logon kii rivyuu pitishan bhi court ne khaarij kar di, lekin phir bhi chauthe doshi akshay ne rivyuu pitishan ab lagaai he
 The guilty have been deliberately delaying, he said, adding that the convict Vinay too has already filed a mercy petition with the President some time before, i
e
, all four are continuously delaying such petitions to stop the hanging
 jitendra jha ne kaha ki nirbhaya ke cese main faansee main ho rahi deree kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki sarkari agency apni kumbhakarna kii neend main soi hui he
 On the continuous delay in hanging, he said that the Delhi government did not make any effort to get the hanging done soon
 vakil jitendra jha ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar kii yah jimmedaari thi kisupreme courtne jab 3 logon kii rivyuu pitishan khaarij kar di to unako faansee par jald se jald latakaane ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se koshish honi chahie thi, lekin ye nahin kiya gaya
 These four convicts know that all of them will be punished simultaneously, that's why they are petitioning one by one to prolong the matter further
 system kii is khami kaa vah bharpoor phayda uthaa rahe hai
 The reason for the delay was a malfunction in the system
 He said that it was only after the hearing on November 28 and 29 on our application that action took place from Tihar administration to Delhi government
 jald faansee die jane kii arji bhi nirbhaya ke mata-pita ne pichley saal disambar main lagaai thi jis par sunwaayee hi 1 saal baad shuru ho pai kyonki fast trek court tak main jajon kii kami he, phir maamla duusare jaj ko transfar kiya gaya
 On the petition of Akshay, advocate Jitendra Jha said that the review petition filed by Akshay in the Supreme Court now has 100 percent chance of being rejected, because the grounds are very weak, and ridiculous
 baaki teen kii yachika pehle hi supreme court khaarij kar chukaa he
 On the increasing incidence of rape in the country, he said that it is very sad that daughters are being raped in different parts of the country, despite this, in the case of Nirbhaya, the government system is sleeping in the sleep of Kumbhrak
 ab is puure maamle main insaaf karne vaale hi jaane ki vonirbhayako insaaf kab tak dilaayenge
 There are reports that his rope is being prepared to hang him from somewhere, preparations are being made to hang him in a jail, but how long the execution will be done, it remains to be seen

 The biggest thing is the state of mind

 In inheritance you can get length, skin color, but not health

 saath hi spikar kaa aacharan bhi sandigdh tha
 So did the mlas value their membership more than insult to Manjhi
 yaa maanjhi apmaan ke naam par unhen saath nahin le paae
 There was a discussion that Manjhi may not be able to prove a majority in the House, but he can create problems for Nitish Kumar by giving a brilliant speech on the pretext of trust
 ab yah kisi ko pataa nahin ki maanjhi ne yah mauka kyon ganvaa diya
 After this, it was rained in Patna
 yahaan press conference to vahaan press conference
 Nitish Kumar said that BJP has been exposed
 susheel modi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar expos ho gaye hai
 At times Manjhi exposes both
 par maanjhi ne bijepi par kuch bhi nahin bolaa he
 The poster of Jungle Raj Two was posted in the press room of Sushil Kumar Modi's house for several days
 is tasviir main nitish lalu ke paanv par hai or maanjhi kursi par baith mouj kar rahe hai
 Usually, the leaders put up the posters of their party, but in the press conference room, the poster of Jungle Raj Two was removed a few minutes before the announcement of Manjhi's support
 aap usee kaa video dekh rahe hai
 a poster of Jungle Raj Two was also found in the BJP office on Friday
 jisamen likhaa he jangal raaj tu kaa aagaaz, remote sarkaar, sahamaa bihar
 On 15 November, the Bihar BJP also brought out a booklet of Jungle Raj Two, in which eight pages have been accused of selling a police station to Manjhi for auctioning a posting of BDO
 yah samaj paanaa mushkil he jis maanjhi ne ek ejineering kalege kaa naam badal kar jagannatha mishra ke naam par rakh diya unke jatigat swabhimaan kii ladaai bijepi kyon lard rahi he
 Jagannath Mishra is a prosecutor in the fodder scam case
 kisi sajayaftaa ke naam par kalege hoga ise bijepi ne apmaan ke taur par kyon nahin dekha
 JDU has put up a poster at Patna station, in which statements of Atal and Advani have been printed in praise of Nitish
 dilli chunaav ke paanch sawaal vaale poster patna bhi pahunch gaye hai
 In this poster, it has been said about Nitish that he has betrayed whom he has been with
 zaahir he bihar kii raajnneeti main abhi kaado keechad hona baaki he
 During the press conference, Nitish Kumar said that by repeatedly speaking Mahadalit Mahadalit, the caste identity of the people sitting on constitutional posts is not correct
 lekin maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banaate vakt kya jediu ne unki har khubi se zyada is khubi kaa prachaar nahin kiya tha ki maanjhi musahar jati se aate hai
 Nitish said that the speaker the BJP is attacking also comes from the Mahadalit class
 ek nishpaksh spikar par hamale karnaa kya mahadalit kaa sammaan he
 BJP was running its game by breaking its party in which it has failed
 jo bhi mahadalit ke swabhimaan ke naam par bijepi or maanjhi nitish ko maat nahin de sake
 Nitish said that Manjhi should have respected the party's decision
 nitish ne kaha ki bijepi pehle dharm ke aadhaar par logon ke man main tikhaapan laati rahi ab samaaj main jaateeyata kaa bhav karne ke liye cast kaa card khel rahi he
 But does Nitish have no cast card? susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki mukhyamantri maanjhi ne hi daawa kiya tha ki mere paas bahumat he, keval siddh karnaa he
 We are the people
 
 
 ek mahadalit ke apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye mahadalit ke bagal main khadey the
 Is this cleanliness of the BJP enough or did Manjhi implicate the BJP as well
 kya bahumat hone ke sirf zubaani daawey ke aadhaar par bijepi maanjhi par bharosa kar baithi
 The question of constitution was big or insulting Mahadalit
 susheel modi ne nitish kumaar ke aaropon kaa khandan kiya ki bihar kii screept bijepi ne nahin likhi he
 Narendra Modi has not written
 maanjhi ke dilli jane se pehle sharad yadav, nitish kumaar or maanjhi kii samjhauta vaarta fail ho gai thi
 BJP has also supported Manjhi that if the MLA voted for us, there was a danger of his membership losing
 kya bijepi khud apni party ke vidhayak ko bina wheep ke vot karne kii ijazat degi
 What will BJP do if a BJP MLA votes in support of Nitish
 wheep ke ulanghan main sadsyta samaapt karne kii karrwai karegi yaa ukt vidhayak ke loktantric adhikaar kaa sammaan karegi
 The arguments that run from both sides are like double-edged swords
 jitna dusron ko nahin katati usase kahin zyada khud ko kaat detii hai
 What is happening in Bihar is a sign of the return of caste
 yaa bihar main pikchar abhi baaki he darshakon

 The sun had just begun to rise and its fire was yet to ignite, but before that, on June 6, people started boiling with rage in villages like Gudbhali and Balaguda, adjacent to the town of Pipilamandi in Mandsaur district in central India
 unke paas ek viral video aayaa tha, jisamen pipaliamandi kaa ek vyapaaree kuch kisaanon ko peet rahaa tha
 On the other hand, allegedly a local police officer had challenged the farmers that now enough force has come, if they have the courage then show up
 vaise, ye donon ghatnaayen bahut badi nahin thim, lekin 1 june se hi kisaan andolan kii ugrata se jhulas rahe madhya pradesh ke malwa or nimad ilaakon main yah chinagaari badi aag banane vaali thi
 In the past five days, farmers in a dozen districts including Mhow, Dewas, Ujjain and Sehore had protested by throwing onions, tomatoes and milk on the streets
 ve is baat se trast the ki pyaaj-tamaato ke daam buree tarah tut chuke hai or is baar hui dalhan kii banpar fasal oune-paune daam par bik rahi he
 In the agitation that started under these circumstances, incidents of skirmish between the farmer and the police were coming to the fore
 lekin 6 june is maamle main thodaa alag tha, kyonki ek din pehle hi bhopal main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki kisaanon kii uchit maangen maan lee gai hai
 He insisted that violent anti-social elements will be dealt with vigorously
 sakhti kii isi ghoshnaa ne police waalon ko kuch zyada hi urja de di
 On the other hand, the farmers were surprised as to how the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), can meet the Chief Minister and announce the end of the Kisan agitation, even though it is not directly related to the movement
 kisaan to yah andolan rashtriya kisaan majudar sangh or bhartiya kisaan union ke binar tale kar rahe the
 The Chief Minister not only deemed these organizations not worth talking about, but also avoided questions related to these organizations in the press conference

 But this time Kakaji was ready to show full strength on the strength of his rebel organization
 unhen nimad ilaake main bhaajapa se jude patidaar samaaj kaa bhi acha sahyog mil rahaa tha
 After the announcement of the end of the strike, Kakaji called it fraud

 What is Article 35A? Article 35A gives special rights to Jammu and Kashmir as a state
 iske tahat die gaye adhikaar 'sthai nivaasiyon' se jude hue hai
 This means that the state government has the right to grant or not provide any kind of facilities to the refugees and other Indian citizens who came from other places in Jammu and Kashmir at the time of independence

 On 12 March, Arun Pandey's company Riddhi Sports signed a joint venture with Pune-based Youth Beverages to sell energy bars, protein bars, protein biscuits, flavored milk and other nutritional products
 bhartiya cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ke praayojan se jude saude riddhi sports hi sambhalati he
 The old friendship with Dhoni is that Pandey takes his name in every next sentence
 unhone riddhi ke daftar ke baahar vishaal maidan main haal hi do jhule is ummid se lagavaayen hai ki dhoni or unki patni sakshi kabhi chahen to isamen aakar samay bitaa saken
 This long journey from Youth Beverages to Agreements consists of strange things like friendship, trust and experimentation that changed the mysterious world of branding, sponsorship and advertising in India
 is sabakaa shrey pandey or dhoni ko jaataa he, jo aaj vigyaapan kii fees ke bataur salanaa 100 karod ru
 Has become the first player from India to earn above
 dhoni kii haisiyat kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unke saath jud kar devi-devtaa bhi phaayde main hai
 Recently, as soon as the news appeared in the newspapers that Dhoni is going to come to the Deori temple at Tamar, an hour's distance from Dhoni's home district Ranchi, the daily number of devotees increased from 50 to 500 and the monthly income of the temple increased from 5,000 to one
 Lakh Rs
 tak
 According to Forbes, the world's richest magazine, Dhoni is ranked 31st on the list of the world's richest players, followed by Usain Bolt, Novak Djokovic and Wayne Rooney
 dhoni ne kul 2
 2 out of the earnings of 65 million dollars
 3 karod dollar vigyaapan se aae hai
 This amount is 40% more than what Sachin Tendulkar earned from advertising for brands and products
 yah aankada june 2012 tak kaa he, jisamen unke haal ke kuch vigyaapan saude, espivi or equity saude shaamil nahin hai
 If all this is added, in the opinion of people close to Dhoni, he would be very close to the first place in the list of rich players
 pandey bataate hai ki riddhi ne 2010 main unka management sambhala tha
 The victory in the World Cup greatly boosted his business
 ''un dinon (dhoni or riddhi kii jodi banane se pehle) unhen ek brands par dhai se teen karod ru
 Used to meet, now Rs 10 crores
 milte hai
 The total amount at that time was 40 crores
 aaj 100 karod ru
 Is greater than
 aap jaanate hai ki khiladinnon kaa kariyar kitna lanbaa hota he
 Dhoni has risen to the top as a brand
 dhoni ke bare main baat karnaa bharat ke bare main baat karne jaisaa he
 "dhoni has not always been in such a situation
 shuruaati dinon main apana brands khadaa karne ke liye unhone enditivi ke saath exclusive saakshatkaaron, baatcheet or vishesh kaaryakramon ke liye sauda kiya tha
 When Dhoni came to the press conference on a Sunday afternoon in May 2006 to announce the deal, he was in long-haired, full-bodied beige tshirt
 lag rahaa tha, koi nayaa-nayaa ladkaa aayaa ho jo gambhir dikhne kii koshish kar rahaa ho
 a year later, they were successful
 sachin tendulkar or rahul dravid ke bagaiyr bharat kii team ne jaise hi tii20 vishwa cap jeeta, desh bhar kii jubaan par ek hi naam tha dhoni
 Pandey had played with Dhoni in Ranji and by that time, he had understood that his talent was so much
 us dauraan unhone apana kuch vakt tii-siries company main guzaaraa jahaan unki dosti gulshan kumaar ke bhai darshan kumaar se ho gai
 Darshan gave him some work there, which increased his understanding
 unhone 2007 main achaanak lambii chalaang lagaai or riddhi sports naamak company kii sthapana kii
 Dhoni was first managed by the gameplan and later by Mindscape Maestros, but Pandey continued with Dhoni
 pandey ne bataaya, ''maine big bazaar or dainik bhaskar ke liye dhoni ke saude karwaae
 Since i had a relationship with Mahi, Jeet (banerjee, the head of the gameplan) also had to go to Mahi on my own way
 maahi ne sabko kah diya ki pandeyji ke madhyam se hi un tak koi pahunch saktaa he
 i started working hard, made four agreements
 ”jis shaks ne 1983 ke baad bharat ko pehla khitaab dilvaaya, uskaa kaamkaaj sanbhaalane ke liye 50 se 60 lakh ru
 Some were not enough
 dhoni ko kuch nuksaan bhi hua
 There was a fashion deal in which one of his close friends was accused of forgery
 haalanki isse riddhi or dhoni ke kareeb aane kii prakriya tej hi hui
 In 2010, Dhoni spent a minimum of Rs 210 crore over three years
 kii guarantee ke liye riddhi ke saath qaraar kar liya
 Now Dhoni has officially superseded Tendulkar, whose last deal for three years was Rs 180 crore
 kaa tha
 Dhoni and Riddhi's relationship did not stop only with sponsorship fees, but together they started changing the rules of sponsorship
 kuch badlaav to maidan se hi aayaa
 His fees when Dhoni became the vice-captain were Rs 1
5 crore
 ho gai
 With the T20 World Cup victory it increased from three crore to five crore
 ja pahunchi
 Pandey says that after the 2011 World Cup victory, getting 10 crore for an advertising deal was a minor thing
 jo bade saude hai, ve sab lambey samay ke liye kiye ja rahe hai
 There have been at least five such deals in which either Riti or Dhoni or both have got an equal share
 soch yah he ki brands dhoni unke ritair hone ke baad bhi bazaar main jinda rahe or kuch saal tak chalane vaale kariyar ke baad har khilaadi ke saamne aane vaali dikkat se paar paa sake
 Smiling Pandey says, "he is my friend
" main unase bada hum
 i do not like to take money from them
 mujhe company bhi to chalaani he

 Two surveys conducted by top industry chambers — FICCI and ASSOCHAM in the first week of September — have confirmed what recruiters and job portals have been telling for several months: Indians for more than a year The pessimism seen in the corporate business prospects has finally taken the shape of recruitment cuts

 Due to recession abroad and policy paralysis in the country, the dream of youth seeking jobs does not seem to end
 asochaum ke surveykshan se sanket miltaa he ki udyog or bhugolic kshetra, donon ke lihaaj se naukariyon main kahaan kami aegi

 The most shocking facts in ficci's April to June 2012 Business Confidence Survey were about employment

 In the FICCI survey, it has been estimated that the growth for the next six months will be "bales", which will not create jobs

 According to the survey by Assocham, the sector had made 66,000 new recruitments during January to March of 2012, but during April to June 2012, the sector had only about 46,000 recruits
 iske baad sabase zyada rojgaar dene vaale sector academix (skool or uniwarsity ab bhi aage bad rahe sector hai) main janvari se march ke dauraan sirf 9,000 logon ko rojgaar mila tha or april se june ke bich 13,000 bhartiyon hui hai jabaki ity sector main keval 15 se 25 fisadi rojgaar kaa srijan hua

Kumar Vishwas took charge on behalf of Kejriwal after Kapil Mishra's allegation of taking 2 crore rupees from Satyendra Jain
 bayaan diya he ki ve kejariwal ko 12 saal se jaanate hai
 They cannot do corruption
 unka tazaatreen twit kahata he, "arvind se meraa 12 varsh kaa parichay he or itane saal kaam karne ke baad main kah saktaa hum ki @arvindkejriwal bhrashtachar karegaa ye main soch bhi nahin saktaa

 When Kumar's faith in Kejwariwal was so strong, then why were bugle bunting to continue to raise voice against corruption inside and outside? Kejriwal is the true Harishchandra of politics, then who in his party should corruption? And that too after waving a red flag from a confidant like Kumar? vishwaas kaa hi shanivaar raat kaa twit he, 'ek andolan or sahi, na thake hai, na dare hai, satta ke kisi ghade kaa boond bhar jal bhi nahin chakhaa isliye abhitak jantar mantar kii aag baaqi he saathiyon aashwast raho
 ' ek andolan or sahi
 Neither tired nor afraid

 Be assured guys — Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) May 6, 2017 Kumar Vishwas did not taste the power but Kejriwal is the CM
 zaahir he is twit main na sirf unpar nishaanaa he balki jantar mantar kii raah pakadaney kii aparoksh dhamkee bhi he
 But it seems that after this tweet by his heroic head, the Kejriwal camp too may have pulled some arrows from his quiver
 tabhi kapil mishra jab gend lekar aage bade to kumaar vishwaas ne goalpost change kar liya
 Vishwas, who raided the night, reached Kejriwal's house with his wife in the morning
 isamen koi buraai nahin he
 This process of coming and going was going on for the last several days

 Kumar Vishwas will have an idea about Kapil Mishra
 aakhir kya ve uske peeche yun hi khadey ho gaye? or bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai ke bharose ke saath khadey hue to phir kapil mishra ke aarope ko kyon kaatane lage? ye do alag baaten nahin hai
 It states that Kumar was either a victim of over-confidence or of some confusion
 or ye unki belaag chhavi ke barkhilaaf he
 The comments nagar nigam chunaav main ummid se bahut kam mili seat ko aam aadmi party kii karaari haar ke taur par dekha gaya
 Two years ago, after winning 67 out of 70 seats in the assembly, Kulbulhat got a big boost in the party that wrote history
 ek ke baad ek kai channelon par namoodaar hokar kumaar vishwaas ne haar kii vajah iviem ko maanane se inkaar kar kejariwal ke daawey par bada hamalaa kar diya
 The distrust gap between the two widened so much that the trust tweet started posting Danadan tweets
 bijepi se mil kar party todane ke amanullah khan ke aarope ke baad kumaar vishwaas ne khan ko party se baahar nikaalane kii zid paal lee
 When Amanullah repeated his allegations, Vishwas said that someone else was behind it

 It is no coincidence that Kumar Vishwas tweeted a short poem

 No one can separate us — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) April 30, 2017 Now the way Kumar has left Kapil and has come to Kejriwal's court, it seems that in this tweet of Kejriwal, there was not only hope but also some concrete ground due to which he was confident that brothers could not separate
 shaayad isliye hi ve apane chote bhai kii bhashaai ashishtataa ko bhi bardaasht karte rahete hai
 Kumar Vishwas, who is bound by his poetry and language style, gives the illusion of being very determined
 lekin lagata he kejariwal ke paas unki bhaawanaaon ko kaabo main rakhane kaa koi mahaamantra he
 Sarji's same hypnosis has shaken Vishwas with his own words
 yaa phir jaisaa ki kumaar vishwaas ne chaar may ko jo ek ritvit kiya uskaa sangyaan lete hue ye maane ki vaaki main 'satya kuch der ke liye pareshaan hua he par abhi parajeet nahin hua he'? His latest tweet says, "I have a 12-year introduction to Arvind and after working so many years i can say that @arvindkejriwal will do corruption that i cannot even imagine
 " i have 12 years of introduction to Arvind and after working so many years, i can say that @arvindkejriwal will do corruption, i can not think — Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) May 7, 2017 very nice
 jab kumaar kaa kejavariwal par vishwaas itnaa tagada tha to phir bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andar or baahar awaz uthaanaa jari rakhane kii bigul kyon phoonk rahe the? kejariwal raajnneeti ke satya harishchandra hai to phir unki party main kiski majaal ki wo bhrashtachar kare? or wo bhi kumaar jaise vishwaasapaatr kii taraf se laal jhanda lahraane ke baad bhi? Saturday night's tweet of faith is, 'A movement is right and not tired, nor scared, not even a single drop of water from a pot of power has tasted, so yet the fire of Jantar Mantar is left, friends, rest assured
 ' a movement and right
 na thake hai,na dare hai
 There is not even a single drop of water from the pitcher of power, that is why the fire of Jantar Mantar is still there
 saathiyo aashwast raho - Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) May 6, 2017 satta kii boond kumaar vishwaas ne nahin chakhi lekin kejariwal to siem hai
 It is obvious that this tweet is not only targeted at him, but there is also a threat to take the path of Jantar Mantar
 lekin lagata he ki unke vir sar ke is twit ke baad kejariwal kheme ne bhi apane tarkash se kuch tir nikaale honge
 Then when Kapil Mishra stepped forward with the ball, Kumar Vishwas changed the goalpost
 raat ko raar chhedane vaale vishwaas subah patni ke saath kejariwal ke ghar ja pahunche
 There is nothing wrong in this

 co / dhl00tdjfm — Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) May 6, 2017 Kapil Mishra claims that he was removed for raising his voice against corruption but the party says that it was removed due to the poor condition of the water distribution system
 kumaar vishwaas ko andaaza to hoga kapil mishra ko lekar
 After all, did they just stand behind him? And if you stood with the confidence of fighting against corruption then why did you start cutting Kapil Mishra's charge? These are not two separate things
 ye bataati hai ki kumaar yaa to ati aatmavishvaas ke shikaar rahe yaa kisi bhram ke

 Our relationship with Mufti Saheb is very good

 in After the Revolt of 1857, the British felt that as long as Hindus and Muslims remain united, the problems for the British Empire in India will remain
 is samasya kaa nidaan dhundha, tatkaaleen british governor general lord canning ne, jinhone angrejon kii prasiddh kootneeti 'foot daalo or raaj karo' ko apanaaya
 The two religions were pitted against each other to end the unity of Hindus and Muslims
 isi abhiyaan main kahin na kahin ram janmabhumi or babari masjid bhi jud gaye
 The story of the dispute is 486 years old
 varsh 1528 main mughal shaasha babar kaa general mir baaqi apane vijay abhiyaan ke dauraan ayodhya pahunchaa, jahaan usne ramamandir ko dhwast karke masjid kaa nirmaan kiya, jiskaa naam usne apane maalik ke naam par babari masjid rakhaa
 This dispute between Hindus and Muslims became a weapon for the British
 mandir-masjid vivaad pehali baar adaalat main san 1885 main pahunchaa
 Mahant Raghubar Das filed a lawsuit in the Faizabad court against the Secretary of State for India for the construction of the temple on the Ram platform adjacent to the Babri Masjid
 18 march, 1886 ko faizabad district jaj ne order paas kiya, jisamen unhone likhaa, "kal main sabhi pakshon ko saath lekar vivaadit zamin par gaya
 
 
 i found that the mosque built by Babur stands on the border of Ayodhya, i
e
 the settlements on the west side and the south side
 
 
 yah bahut durbhaagya kii baat he ki masjid us jagah banaai gai, jo hinduon ke liye poojaneey thi
 
 
 But it has been 356 years since the incident, so it is too late to hear the complaint
 
 
 " (court kaa faisla, karnal epaie chamier dwaara, district jaj, faizabad, 1886) This decision of the court also served to increase rather than end the dispute between the two religions
 varsh 1949 se lekar ab tak yah vivaad adaalat main hi gum rahaa he
 Hundreds of riots, thousands were killed, many houses were destroyed
 donon pakshon ke apane-apane tark hai
 
 
 Hindus want to build temples, Muslim mosques, and secular people want to build schools or hospitals
 koi bhi jhukna nahin chahta
 Now Ram Janmabhoomi - Babri Masjid Action Committee advocate Hashim Ansari in Babri Masjid case tried to reduce the distance between the two religions
 unhone kaha ki ab ramalala ko vah aaazaad dekhnaa chaahate hai
 He will no longer advocate the Babri Masjid case at any cost
 unhone kaha ki ramalala tirpal main rahen or log mehalon main
 
 
 People eat laddus and Ramlala cardamom seeds, this cannot be done
 zaahir he, kuch log unke is faisle kaa swaagat karenge or kuch virodh
 The British left, but their divide and rule policy was well used by our leaders, especially after 1985
 kisi ne hinduon kaa hamdard banakar, kisi ne musalaamanon kaa rahanuma banakar, lekin sabhi ne raajnneeti kii rotiyaan khub senki
 According to his convenience, Ram keeps and removes the temple in his manifesto
 is vivaad kaa nipataara adaalat ke faisle se nahin ho saktaa
 Settlement will happen only when people of both religions talk together, taking care of each other's feelings
 agar donon paksh ansaari jaisaa hi faisla le paaenge, to sadiyon purana vivaad khatm ho saktaa he

 There is no cure for acute encephalitis syndrome
 yah durbhaagya he ki tamaam koshishon or research ke baad bhi aisi koi dawaai nahin banaai ja saki jisase peedit rogiyon kaa ilaaj ho sake
 Even the virus behind this disease has not been identified yet
 aise main acute incephelitis syndrome (eies) ke liye ilaaj ke liye vaxin kaise ban sakati he
 In Muzaffarpur and nearby areas, the disease starts in May and lasts till July
 uske baad yah apane aap khatm ho jaati hai
 Why this disease ends after the rain is also a mystery
 vaigyanikon ne acute incephelitis syndrome par kaaphi research kiya lekin jo kuch bhi nattejey saamne aae hai, wo bahut kanvincing nahin hai
 a team of scientists was formed to remove the secret of the disease
 usamen se ek kaaran jo scientiston ne objrv kiya ki lichi kaa fasal sijan isi maheene main he or jab lichi pakane lagati he or tapak jaati he to bachche lichi ke bagan main jaakar giri hui lichi ko bhi kha lete hai, usamen virus ho saktaa hai

 halaki, mujffarpur ke kejariwal aspataal main unhone kaha ki bacchon glucose dijie
 Children will not die by giving glucose and literally giving glucose saves the lives of many children who reach the hospital on time
 doctor prabhaat kumaar sinha ne bataaya ki doctor jaikab ne acute incephelitis syndrome ko lekar ek theory di jisamen unhone bataaya ki ye beemaari sabase pehle north vietnam main pai gai
 This was followed by cases in the African country of Jamaica
 sanyog ki baat ye he ki in donon jagahon par lichi kaa utpaadan hota he
 Muzaffarpur is also known for producing litchi
 doctor prabhaat bataate hai ki ham logon ne doctor seepi thakur ke saath milakar research kii
 Some samples were also assembled
 unhone bataaya ki hamaari team ko lichi main toxin mila jo blad sugar vakiplacemia kii vajah banataa he

 Raising another controversy over the country's first home minister Sardar Patel, senior BJP leader LK Advani, quoting a book, today alleged that when Patel suggested sending troops for the merger of Hyderabad into India after independence, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru called him a 'fully communal person'
 adwani ne apane blog kii nai posting main emkeke nair kii pustak ‘da story of en era told vidout il vil’’ kaa uddhran diya
 This book mentions the 'sharp conversation' between Nehru and Patel in the cabinet meeting held before the 'police action' against Hyderabad
 hyderabad kaa nizaam pakistan main shaamil hona chahta tha or usne padosi desh main ek doot bhi bheja tha tathaa usne vahaan kii sarkaar ko kaaphi dhan bhi hastantarit kiya tha
 Nizam officials were allegedly persecuting the local people
 adwani ne nair kii kitaab ke hawaale se likhaa, cabinet kii ek baithak main patel ne in baton ke bare main bataaya or maang kii ki hyderabad ke aatankabhre shashan ko samaapt karne ke liye sena bheji jaae
 Nehru, who usually talks with humility and courtesy, said, "you are completely communal
" main aapaki sifarish ko kabhi nahin maanoonga
 Advani said in his blog, Patel was not deterred by this, instead he took his papers and left the room
 bhaajapa pichley kuch samay se yah sabit karne kii koshish kar rahi he ki sardaar patel aise netaa the, jo hindutv vichaardhaara ke nikat the
 On 31 October, Advani praised the country's first home minister for the inauguration of Patel's 138th anniversary construction of his tallest 182 meter statue in the world
 is pariyojna ko shuru karne vaale gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne kaha ki bharat ke logon ko ek karne vaali patel kii dharmanirpekshata kii jarurat he na ki in dinon prachlit ‘‘votbank dharmanirpekshata’’ kii
 Both Advani and Modi have tried to portray themselves as leaders who carry forward Patel's legacy
 bhaajapa ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki congress ne kabhi patel ke yogadan kii prashansa nahin kii or usne keval nehru-gandhi parivaar kii saraahna kii he
 Advani wrote in his blog that the then Governor General Rajaji persuaded Nehru to send troops to Hyderabad
 rajaji ne halaat lagaataar bigadate jane par is masale par charchaa ke liye nehru or patel ko raashtrapati bhawan bulaayaa
 Meanwhile, the army was kept ready for war
 rajaji ne us baithak ke dauraan british ucchayukta ke ek patr kaa bhi istemaal kiya, jisamen hyderabad main razaakaaron dwaara do din pehle ek convent kii 70 varshiya nan kaa balaatkaar karne kii ghatana par virodh jataayaa gaya tha
 Patel's close aide VP Menon gave this letter to Rajaji before the meeting
 adwani ne kitaab ke hawaale se kaha, rajaji ne apane khaas andaaj main hyderabad main sthiti kaa varnan kiya
 He felt that no further delay should be taken in deciding the matter to protect India's reputation, but Nehru was concerned about the international consequences
 tab rajaji ne british ucchayukta kaa patr dikhaaya
 He said, Nehru read the letter
 unka cheharaa laal ho gaya, gusse ke chalate unke shabd nahin nikal rahe the
 He got up from his chair, hit his fist on the table and shouted, we should not waste a single moment
 ham unhen sabak sikhayenge
 Advani said, Rajaji immediately asked Menon to inform the Chief Commander to act as planned

 There was a rumor once that another star would be given a chance to replace Keanu Reeves in the film, but later the producer company itself offered a clarification on it
 luiciana ke bhartiya-america governor bobi jindal ne apane praant main lokapriyata ke maamle main desh ke raashtrapati baraak obama ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 According to a recent survey report, most of the people of the province want Jindal, a charismatic Republican leader, to continue as the Governor of Louisiana instead of contesting the presidential election in 2012
 praant ke 55 pratishat matadaataaon ne jindal ke kaam ko saraahaa
 This percentage is 11 points higher than the Obama got
 public policy poling ke rajyavyapee surveykshan main paaya gaya he ki governor banane ke pehle saal ke baad mili lokapriyata ke mukaable maujuuda reating main kaaphi giravat ke baavjood luiciana main jindal ab bhi logon ke chahete hai
 During the survey, people ranked Jindal third among 17 governors
 duusari ore, obama ko luiciana main samekit rup se nakaaratmak reating mili
 Obama had lost by 20 points to Louisiana on 20 November last year
 surveykshan ke mutabik 44 pratishat matadaataaon ne unke kaam ko saraahaa jabaki 50 pratishat logon ne use nakaar diya
 However, people reacted mixedly to Jindal's candidature for the 2012 presidential election
 survey ke nattejey dikhaate hai ki 61 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki jindal ko is chunaav ke liye koshish nahin kerani chaiye jabaki sirf 27 pratishat log hi iske paksh main dikhe
 It is known that Jindal's stature in the Republican Party is increasing and many people believe that he can try to get candidacy in the 2012 presidential election
 jindal ne haalanki aisi khabaron se inkaar kiya he
 a great achievement in the field of mathematics was achieved when the great mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujam, who has been confounding mathematicians around the world for nearly one hundred years, solved the theory of mathematics and scientists say that it complicated the behavior of black holes Questions can be solved
 mahaj 32 saal kii choti umr main duniya se kooch kar gaye ganit ke jeniyas ramanujam 1920 main mrityushaiya par the
 Then he wrote a letter to his mentor and British mathematician GH Hardy
 is patr main bhartiya ganitagya ne anek nae ganitiya falan (function) kii ruparekha pesh kii jise usase pehle kabhi suna bhi nahin gaya tha
 In this letter, Ramanujam also indicated these functions about how they work
 daily mail kii ek report ke anusaar anusandhankartaaon ne bataaya ki unhone sabit kiya ki ramanujam kaa formula bilkul sahi tha or yah formula ‘‘blike hole’’ ke bartaavon kii bhi vyakhya kar saktaa he
 The black hole was a period of trouble from where the gravitational light does not allow anything to come out
 emory vishvavidhyalay ke ganitagya ken ono ne kaha, ‘hamane rahasyon se bhari unki aakhri chitthiyon ke problem hal kar liye hai
 The problem was open to people working in this field of mathematics for 90 years
 ’ono ne kaha ki dakshin bharat ke ek gaanv main janme ramanujam ghar par khud hi pard kar ganitagya bane
 He was so involved in mathematics and used to spend so much time meditating on it that he failed the college twice
 ramanujam ne apane patr main anek nae function kii charchaa kii thi jo gyaat ‘theta function’ yaa pramapiya sutron (modular farms) se bhinn tarah se vyavhaar karte hai lekin unki bahut nikat se nakal karte hai
 Functions are equations that can be drawn as a graph on a cell similar to a 'sine wave' and give an 'output' when enumerating for a selected 'input' or value
 ramanujam ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki unka abhaasi modular farm un saamaanya modular farm ke sadrush hota he jinaki pahchaan karl jaikobi ne kii thi or ek ke mul (roots) ke liye donon kaa samaahaar samaan output ke saath hota he
 Ono said, 'we proved that Ramanujam was right
 hamane paaya ki formula un drushtiyon main se ek kii vyakhya karata he jinke bare main vah samajhate the ki vah unki devi se ai he
 'researchers were stunned to see that the formula, almost a hundred years old, can still be used today
 ono ne kaha, ‘jab ramanujam sabase pehle apane abhaasi modular farms le kar aae to 1920 dashak main koi bhi blike hole kii charchaa nahin karata tha, or uske baavjood unka formula unke bare main rahasyon ko beparda kar saktaa he
 'ramanujam died on 26 April 1920 at the young age of 32 years

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Palestine's Ramalla on February 10 after hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which will be the first Palestinian visit by any Indian Prime Minister
 pichley saal pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa isroyal daura bhi kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa pehla daura tha, iske baad modi ke philistin daure ko donon deshon ke saath bharat ke rishte ko alag-alag karne ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, joki pehle se chali aa rahi parampara ke thik ulat he
 India has been balancing its relationship in the region for a long time
 modi kaa yah daurabharat ke lihaaj se kaaphi mahatvapurn he, kyonki un kayaason ko khatm karne main sarkaar ko madad milegi, jinamein kaha ja rahaa tha ki 2014 main modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke saath bharat kii philistin niti badal gai he
 The recent vote in the United Nations against US President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital is seen as retaining India's old policy on Palestine
 times of india kii khabar ke mutabik pradhanmantri modi ke philistin daure ke kaaryakramon ko antim rup diya janaa baaki he
 According to government sources based in New Delhi, Modi can fly from Amman in Jordan to Ramalla in Palestine by helicopter
 ramalla kaa west bank shahar philistin kii prashasnic rajdhani he
 The route by which Modi will go to Ramalla is just eight kilometers from Jerusalem
 aise main isroyal or philistin ke rishte ko alag-alag karke dekh rahi sarkaar kii niti ke sandarbh main ye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 In such circumstances, it would be easy for Modi to leave Israel, as he did with the Palestinians during their visit to Israel
 bataa den ki bhartiya pradhanmantri ke isroyal daure ke samay modi ke ramalla na jane se philistin main kaaphi niraashaa kaa bhav tha
 Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestine Center for Policy and Research Center in Ramalla, told a group of Indian journalists and leaders last year that there was a lot of concern in Palestine about India's stance, which had shifted from its policy since 1947
 Used to be
 shikaaki ne kaha tha, 'bharat ke maujuuda pradhanmantri suraksha or pashchim ke saath apane rishte main zyada ruchi le rahe hai
 The Palestinians now feel that they do not have India's support
 'sanyukt raashtra main yerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ke taur par manyata dene ke america prastaav ke khilaaf vot karke or ab pradhanmantri modi ke ramalla daure se sarkaar yah bataanaa chaah rahi he ki isroyal ke saath bharat ke rishte philistin kii keemat par nahin banenge
 The Modi government is very conscious that the support of Palestine has been an important part of India's foreign policy for a long time
 bataa den ki netanyahu ke saath modi ke do sanyukt bayanon main isroyal-philistin sangharsh ke mudde par bharat ke paramparaagat 2 state solution kaa koi zikr nahin he
 However, the government has also not clarified whether it continues with the old stand or not
 pichley saal ek israeli akhbaar ko die intervyuu main modi ne kaha tha ki isroyal or philistin ke shantipurna sashastitv ke liye bharat 2 state solution main vishwaas karata he
 The same thing was repeated by the Prime Minister during the visit of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to India in May 2017
 kashmir ghati se lagbhag sabhi hinduon yani kashmiri panditon ko baahar kiye jane kii ghatana khud-ba-khud samasya kii ek baangi ban gai he
 The share of Kashmiri Pandits used to be less than five percent of the population of Kashmir
 aaj ke samay main jab kareeb 5 lakh logon ko sirf apane dharm kii vajah se apane hi desh main nirvasit hona padaa ho to yah is mudde ke baaki sabhi masalon par baari padai chahie
 It would also add to the fact that Kashmiri Pandits are probably a rare community with 100% literacy and zero crime rates
 andolan, hangaamaa, hinsa yaa bahut uksaane par bhi pratikaar kaa uskaa koi record nahin rahaa he
 Despite this they have collectively faced campaigns of murder, rape, terror and hatred
 shantipurna logon ke saath aisi akaaran barbarta kii vajah se hi ise itnaa ghrunit mana gaya ki chaahe iske peeche jo bhi vajahen or tark hon, yah bardaasht ke baahar tha
 Nearly a quarter-century later, this religious-ethnic cleansing has become an indelible identity of illegality, which not only shows that the separatists had falsely cloaked the fighters for freedom and that majority of Muslims often became apathetic bystanders
 , But also that the governments and political organizations of the time kept giving free rein to criminals for a long time trapped in their 'secular' illusions
 aaj har koi galatiyon ko sudhaar kar bedaag or taaja dikhnaa chahta he, lekin is masale se judi gatividhiyon main ai achaanak teji ek jaldbaaji kaa sanket de rahi he
 Such haste, which is expected to get caught in such a trap, that the discussion on non-urgent issues can be started instead of necessary issues
 pehla sawaal to yahi he ki aakhir kashmiri panditon ko baahar kyon kiya gaya? kya ghati main kashmiri panditon ko waapas bhejnaa is samasya kaa hal he? kya 'paband vaale package’ se ashankaayen nahin bani rahengi, beemaari kaa galat ilaaj akasar marz ko badha detaa he? pichley 66 varsh main saaf dikh rahaa virodhabhas yah he ki dharmanirpeksh bharat ne jammu-kashmir main sampradayik agenda ko hi aage badhaayaa he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, the advocates of Islam, through a memorandum of understanding without referendum, talk of getting Kashmir out of the Indian Union
 yaa ise hindu bharat par ek aitihaasik krupa ke rup main dekhte hai
 The truth is that both have the same basic motive
 jammu-kashmir ko algaavvaadi agenda kaa bhugolic kshetra banaae rakhana
 Article 370 provides the necessary oxygen to such a plan, otherwise it would have been difficult to keep the society there on the path of fundamentalism on such a large scale
 ghati ke alaava duusare kshetron ke saath bhedbhaav, gujjaron, bakarawaalon, paharipoon, shiya, sikhon, baudhon jaise duusari pahchaan ke logon ko haashie par dhakelnaa, jisaki paraakaashtha kashmiri panditon ke nishkasana main hui
 This is actually the long term result of Article 370
 aaj bhi anuchhed 370 algaavvaadiyon kii is baat main madad kar rahaa he ki jo bhi bahulwaadi, udaar or deshbhakt samaaj bachaa he, use kattarpanthi wahabi algaavvaadi pashaan kaaleen samaaj main badal saken
 BJP has been raising this issue since the beginning and has been standing with it continuously
 jansangh ke sansthaapak adhyaksh shyama prasad mukherjee kii varsh 1953 main srinagar main shaikh abdulla kii jail main rahasyamay maut ho gai thi
 They were arrested for defying the indiscriminate law that had made the two countries in the Indian Union one way or the other
 jammu-kashmir ko alag jhda, alag samvidhan or alag pradhanmantri muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 Then in 1990, when Hindus were expelled from their homes in the valley, the BJP was ahead in raising this issue once again
 nabbe ke dashak se hi anuchhed 370 aisa masalaa rahaa he, jisane bijepi ko baaki dalon se alag kiya he
 The general election has given this party a significant number which even the Vajpayee government did not have before
 kashmir masale ko hal karne ke liye jis nirnaayak daur kii darkaar thi, aaj vah maujuud he
 So, what to do in Jammu and Kashmir? First of all, without exception, every kind of radical organizations should be pushed to question the basic idea of a plural, liberal and tolerant society
 iske baad anuchhed 370 par khuli saarvajanik charchaa karai jaae
 Political restructuring of Jammu and Kashmir should be done so that it does not remain a colony of the valley
 itnaa hi mahatvapurn yah bhi he ki kashmiron panditon ke khilaaf atyaachaar karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaae
 Hundreds of demolished and occupied temples and pilgrimages have been renovated in the last several decades
 kashmiri panditon ke punarvaas ke liye surakshit or tikaoo vaataavaran or kshetra banaaya jaae
 There is no fatwa to push Kashmir on the path of fundamentalism, similarly some announcements will not be enough to remove it from that path
 kam-se-kam iske liye kuchhek dashakon tak sthir rajnatik vyavastha, swasth shiksha pranali, peshewar police vyavastha, aatank se sakhti se pesh aane vaali nyaay vyavastha or pashchimi padosi ko yah ehsaas karnaa hoga ki yahaan pareshaani khadaa karnaa aasaan nahin he
 These things used to look like fantasy at first but things have changed after the mandate given to Narendra Modi
 susheel pandit nirvasit kashmiri pandit or kashmir kii samskruti or pahchaan se judi patrika prajnath ke prakaashak hai CRPF jawans carry out any operation in Naxalite areas putting their lives at risk, but these jawans are becoming more heart attack, dengue, malaria and suicide than the Naxal operation

 — Hansal Mehta (@mehtahansal)february 4, 2015 Ayushman Bharat Yojana will be implemented in the decision to discontinue Bhamashah Health Scheme
 Ayushman Bharat Yojana will be renamed as applicable Rajasthan Government has made two marks with one stone
 vasundhara sarkaar ke dauraan lagu hui sabase badi bhamashah swasthya yojana band karne kaa faisla kiya he
 It has been argued that the Ayushman Bharat scheme of the central government will be implemented, but the Gehlot government has changed the name of the central government's Ayushman Bharat scheme to be implemented in Rajasthan
 rajasthan main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii mahatvakankshi yojana kaa naam badalte hue ayushmaan bharat mahatma gandhi swasthya yojana kar diya he
 Ever since coming to power, the Gehlot government wanted to discontinue Vasundhara Raje's biggest scheme, the Bhamashah Swasthya Yojana, but the decision was not being taken due to its popularity
 gauratlab he ki bijepi shashan ke dauraan vasundhara raaje ne centre kii ayushmaan bharat yojana ko ye kahkar lagu karne se manaa kar diya tha ki bhamashah yojana main zyada log cover hote hai, jabaki ayushmaan bharat yojana lagu karne par bahut log iske daayre se baahar aa jaaenge
 When the Congress government came to Rajasthan, the card of Ayushman Bharat scheme was sent to the house of the people through the post office
 congress kii taraf se kaha gaya tha ki iskaa raajnneetik istemaal ham nahin karne denge
 But now Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has found a way to deal with both of them and has announced to discontinue the Bhamashah Yojana in the state from September 1 and implement Ayushman Bharat Mahatma Gandhi Health Scheme
 vahiin rajasthan chikitsa mantri, dow
 Raghu Sharma told, "this work with this name will start in Rajasthan from 1 September
 kareeb ek karod 10 lakh parivaar isamen labhanvit honge or main samajhataa hum ki vibhaag kii taiyaari ho chuki he
 This is a big decision for the people of Rajasthan
 "gauratlab he ki chunaav ke dauraan swasthya mantri raghu sharma ne bhari sabha main kaha tha ki congress satta main ai to vasundhara raaje kii banaai swasthya card bhamashah ko tod degi
 Regarding this, the BJP had threatened that if the Congress has courage, Bhamashah should stop the scheme
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot bhamashah swasthya yojana ko rajya kaa bada ghotaalaa bataate rahe hai
 Health Minister Raghu Sharma has said that the two will be combined to form the Ayushman Bharat Mahatma Gandhi Swasthya Yojana, so that no person in the state can opt out of this scheme
 jo log bhamashah swasthya yojana kaa laabh le rahe hai un sabhi logon ko ayushmaan bharat mahatma gandhi swasthya yojana main jagah milegi
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has given clarification about the party joining hands with BJP
 party ke jis mukhpatr ‘saamana’ ke sampadakeey main uddhav thakare haal philhal tak bijepi or modi sarkaar par tikhe hamale karte aae hai, usee ke jariye uddhav thakare ne bijepi ke saath nae sire se gathbandhan ko lekar apni baat rakhi
 Let us know that since the announcement of bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Mumbai on Tuesday, Shiv Sena chiefs were being trolled on social media
 saamana main likhe gaye lambey chaude sampadakeey kii 5 ahm baaten is prakaar hai-- bijepi adhyaksh amit shah khud matoshri aae the or unke saamne shivasena ne ‘thakare style’ main purazor dhang se apana paksh rakhaa
 - Allegiance with BJP neither exodus nor helplessness
 desh main hawa kis disha main bah rahi he yah kal hi pataa chalegaa lekin ‘hawa’ hamaari ore gum gai he
 We will not show back because the wind will come itihaas ko ise darj karnaa hoga
 That's all for now
 talwaar kii dhar barkaraar he or shivasena kii talwaar ‘myanaband’ nahin he
 How did they reunite despite the duly split from BJP in 2014? Will the Ram temple be built? Will Shiv Sena become Chief Minister? There are many such questions and their answers are positive
 - nitish kumaar jaise bharosemand saathi ne bhi do baar ‘endie’ choda he
 To come together in politics, some common words are said such as 'national comprehensive interest', 'public interest' and 'public will'
 is ichha ke anusaar congress kaa mahagathbandhan ho saktaa he or niteesha kumaar aadi NDA main aa sakate hai to shivasena to is NDA kii barabari kii hissedaar hi he
 - The situation in 2019 is such that this election is not to fight on wave but on thought, work and future
 rahul gandhi kii progress book 2014 kii tulana main avashya hi sudhari he
 Priyanka Gandhi is there to help, but she cannot be compared to Modi's leadership
 sampadakeey main ye bhi likhaa gaya he ki shivasena ne peeth par waar sahakar bahe hue khun kii keemat dekar sanghathan ko aage badhaayaa, yah palaayan nahin hota or na hi laachaari hoti he, jodtod to bilkul nahin hota

 We also appeal to the protesters to abstain from violence

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi called these demonstrations sad and disappointing and appealed for peace

 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said, 'the central government is fully responsible for the violence in the country by bringing a law which is being opposed all over the country and all opposition parties are opposing
 agar sarkaar yah kanoon nahin laati to koi hinsa nahin hoti
 Under the leadership of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress also staged a silent demonstration at India Gate from 4 pm to 6 pm

 co / i3e7uckcis — Bigg Boss (@biggboss) November 3, 2016 didisie maamle main teen sadasyeey jaanch kamity kii report aane ke baad bijepi ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par joardaar hamalaa kiya he
 On Sunday, BJP spokesperson MJ Akbar said in a press conference that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is not named anywhere in the investigation report
 dilli ke siem kejariwal ko puure maamle main jetali se maafee maangani chahie
 BJP spokesperson said, 'there is no name of Finance Minister Arun Jaitlika anywhere in the investigation report
 ham pehle hi kehete the ki vah bedaag hai or un par jhuthe iljaam lagaae gaye hai
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should apologize to the Finance Minister and go to court and accept the defamation
 ' emje akbar ne aage kaha ki aam aadmi party ab yah kamjor tark de rahi he ki yah jaanch kisi vyakti vishesh ko lekar nahin thi
 MJ Akbar, while targeting the Chief Minister of Delhi, said, 'you have investigated in every way
 ab samay aa gaya he ki aap jetali ji se maafee maange
 'he further said,' The truth of the file on which Kejriwal formed the basis of all the attacks has been revealed
 isse saaf ho gaya he ki isamen arun jetali ke khilaaf na koi aarope he naa unka naam he
 On the pretext of Congress, the AAP leader said that in the report dated March 12, 2013, the Congress had tried, but the report said that there is nothing against Khitli
 15 november 2015 kii report main bhi kuch nahin aayaa he
 Kejriwal should also go to court and say that defamation has taken place
 'tamaasha dikhaakar sarkaar nahin chalati'emje akbar ne dilli sarkaar par karaara waar karte hue kaha ki tamaasha dikhaakar sarkaar nahin chaalaaya jaataa he
 Jaitley made no mistake and Arvind Kejriwal has made every mistake
 dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya kii sibiai diarector ko chitthee ke sawaal par akbar ne kaha, 'yah ek nayaa jhooth he mukhya mudde se bhatakaane ke liye he
 'let us know that Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia wrote a letter to the CBI director saying that some malicious information was being leaked from the agency and a conspiracy was being hatched to defame the Delhi government
 kejariwal ne kiya twitadusri ore, jaanch report ke baad bijepi ke aakraamak rukh ko dekhte hue arvind kejariwal ne twitor par apana paksh rakhaa he
 Kejriwal wrote that the difference between BJP and 'AAP' is that where AAP takes action on the basis of evidence, BJP supports corruption and runs away from investigation
 Thats the difference betn BJP n AAP
 AAP takes strong n swift action on credible evidence
 BJP defends corruption n runs away from inv— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)december 27, 2015interesting to see how some media houses are desperately trying to prove Jaitley ji innocent
 Why is Jaitley ji afraid of facing inquiries? Giving a clean chit, but no one said to get it investigated
 'aap' netaa ne kaha, 'bijepi ab nai bhashaa lekar ai he ki jab tak unke netaa bhrashtachar ke cese main camere par nahin pakade jate, vah use bhrashtachar nahin maanati he
 aap's habit of lying: BJP leader Shrikant Sharma said after the Srikrant Sharma inquiry report that the Aam Aadmi Party has a habit of lying
 unhone kaha, 'dilli ke logon ko ab kejariwal se nafrat he jo kaam nahin kar rahe sirf jhuthe aarope laga rahe hai

 After defeating Pakistan in 2006, Pervez Musharraf also advised not to get a haircut, expressing his passion for her big hair
 lekin asli majaa to tab aayaa jab us player ne bharat lautate hi apane bal katwa liye

 Thank you Dhoni, for saying goodbye to Test cricket without creating a spectacle
 jaanakar khushi hui ki jaise tum cricket main achaanak aakar sansani failaa gaye the, thik usee tarah tumne test cricket ko achaanak alavida kah diya
 At a time when the BCCI organized a series with a 'weak team' on their land to give a good farewell to the God of cricket, in this round you took a farewell as soon as the match was over
 haalanki kai myanon main ye vidaai tumhaare bahut se prashansakon ko akhri bhi hogi lekin shuruaati dinon main jis mizaaj ke saath tum aae the, thik usee mizaaj ke saath tumne test cricket se vidaa le lee

 Let your fellow players in the team also get the idea that you are no longer in Test cricket
 hukumat kohli ke haath main he or kohli kaa mizaaj tum jaisaa to katai nahin he
 You will remember the matter of Yuvraj, as long as the bat speaks, it is chic
 ye dukhad he ki test cricket main tumhaara balla ab nahin bol paaegaa
 But it is expected that in the ODI and Cricket World Cup, your chic will remain the same as Dhoni, which appears in an advertisement saying, tight grip, tight grip

 Aditya has always dreamed of going into the IT industry
 usne apane parents se baat kii or dilli ke pratishthit koching centre se iity kii koching leni shuru kar di
 It was not that he was weak in studies but he had scored 85% marks in class X
 lekin vah iity-jeii se jude compitishan se bakhubi waakif tha
 His two years of hard work paid off and he got admission in computer science at IIT
 aditya kehete hai, 'mujhe institute main do saal main jo sikhaaya or bataaya gaya, vah main kahin or se hasil nahin kar saktaa tha
 i was helped to clear my basics and for the whole two years my mind remained on the same objective
 ' haai profile corcej main daakhile ke liye koching ek achook hathiyaar ke taur par saamne aa rahi he
 As a result of this, now schools have started giving engineering or medical coaching to the children by collaborating within their campus
 lakhanu ke ribik rostrum koching institute ke siemdi aditya kumaar kehete hai, 'do-dhai dashak pehle tak koching yaa tution vahi students lete the jo padhai main kamjor hote the
 The scene has changed with the arrival of experts in this field, now children come here to make themselves the best
 'haalanki har student is mukaable main safal nahin ho saktaa
 On many occasions, of course, they are unable to reach the institute of their own free will, but through this guidance, they step on the path of fulfilling their dream
 jaise bihar ke vikaas iity main nahin ja sake to unhone punjab kii ek privet uniwarsity main daakhila le liya or ab vahiin se ejineering kii padhai kar rahe hai
 That is why many areas in different corners of the country are emerging as coaching bases
 inamen rajasthan ke kota, uttar pradesh ke kanpur, bihar ke patna or madhya pradesh ke indore ke naam pramukhataa se aate hai
 The coaching business in Patna has crossed the Rs 1,000 crore mark
 aaie jaanate hai ki kis tarah koching udyog yahaan nayaa mukaam hasil kar rahaa he
 More than six lakh boys and girls come to Kota every year
 vajah, is shahar ko iity or anya pravesh parikshaon kii koching kaa makka samaj jaataa he
 Apart from these, they are also 'unsuccessful' people, who are preparing again and leave their institute and try their luck by enrolling in another
 siton ke simit hone ke kaaran sabhi students kaa iity main daakhila milane kaa sapana puraa nahin ho paata, lekin kampitishan main jeetne or apane khwab ko puraa karne ke liye is shahar kii ore aane vaale students kii sankhya main ijapha ho rahaa he
 Students in Kota coaching centers have to pay fees between Rs 40,000 and Rs 1 lakh annually
 unki fees course par nirbhar karti he
 Apart from this fee, students have to spend at least 60,000 rupees every year on living and food
 yahaan aane vaale zyaadaatar students desh ke vibhinn hisson se aate hai
 17-year-old Anurag Gulung from Gangtok, Sikkim, came to Kota last year, and 16-year-old Mohammad Kamran is from Oman
 is chote-se shahar main kareeb teen darjan koching centre hai
 Some of them are big names like Bansal Classes, Ellen Career Institute, Resonance, Vibrant and Career Point
 2011 main dakshin korea kii koching company itus ne kota main apana centre kholaa he
 Choi Young Joo, director of Overseas Business at the Itus Academy, says, "IIT is the most famous brand of Indian education abroad and Kota is its hub
 'yahaan ke institutes kaa kaarobaar khub fal-phool rahaa he
 Many institutes are even taking entrance exams to get students admitted
 haal ke varshon main koching centaron ke bich badi pratispardhaa kii vajah se inaki pravesh parikshaayen aasaan hui hai or adhiktar centre sabhi bacchon ko daakhila de hi dete hai
 Pramod Maheshwari, who established a career point in Kota in 1993 and was an iit-delhi student, says, "if we refuse the student, he will enroll in another institute
" ' in institutes main prayek main alag sankhya main students hote hai
 The foundation of the coaching industry in Kota was in the 1980s
 ke
 Engineer V
 in synthetics
 ke
 Bansal had kept it
 unhone apane teaching kariyar kii shuruyaat sthaneey students ko maths padhaane se kii thi
 In 1986, Kota came into the limelight when Sanjeev Arora topped the IIT
 bansal bataate hai ki unke students main se 13 ne 1990 main pravesh pariksha crack kii thi
 J
 in the 1990s
 ke
 After the closure of the synthetics, many engineers joined the Bansal classes
 baad main inamen se kai ne apane institute khol liye
 In 1995, 51 students of Kota won the IIT
 is tarah yah kaarobaar aage badaae laga
 The wave arose as coaching centers started hiring IIT graduates as teachers
 maheshwari bataate hai ki unhone 1997 main campus placement ke jariye 12 faikalti members kaa chayan kiya tha
 This trend continued till 2002 but after that the IIT stopped the campus placement of coaching centers
 aaj lagbhag, koching se jude 35 fisadi log iity se hi hai
 The demand of good teachers has also increased their salary, which can be up to Rs 30 lakhs annually
 anbhavi adhyapakon kii selary to isaki bhi doguni ho sakati he
 To curb their salary, there is an unwritten agreement among the centers that they will not call each other's teachers by greed for higher salaries
 iity-bombai ke student rah chuke om sharma, jo ek institute main mathematics padhaate hai, kehete hai, 'lekin itus ne rejonence ke 11 teachers ko salanaa kareeb 1 karod rupee ke vetan par bulaakar is aam sahmati ko darkinar kar diya
 'the reason for students to focus more on coaching than school is that the engineering entrance exam is completely different from class 12th
 institutes ne is maukey kaa laabh uthaaya or skulon se contract kar liya
 In such a system, the students enroll the names in these schools, but do not go to class
 isaki jagah ve ejineering kii taiyaari main lag jate hai or 12veen class kii pariksha ke samay hi skool jate hai
 Such institutes have opened their own schools, where they enroll children from class VI and prepare for IIT
 is saal pravesh pariksha ke formet main or bhi badlaav kiye gaye hai, jisamen 12veen class kii board pariksha ko zyada mahatv diya jayega
 Pramod Maheshwari of Career Point says, "the new format will increase students' dependence on coaching centers
 isse students par dabaav doguna ho jayega
 He first used to resort to coaching for the entrance examination
 ab ve board pariksha ke liye bhi koching kaa sahaara lenge
 Govind Maheshwari, director of the Ellen Career Institute, says that many institutes tried to gain a foothold in the quota, but were not successful
 kota ke institute ab guwahati, patna, chandigarh or bangaloru jaise duusare shaharon main bhi apni branch khol rahe hai
 But Bansal says that student quota will be coming for students seeking admission in engineering
 haalanki is bare main koi aadhikarik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he, lekin koching ke kaarobaar main shaamil logon kaa anumaan he ki iity main kareeb ek-chauthai siton par kota ke chaatro kaa kabja hota he
