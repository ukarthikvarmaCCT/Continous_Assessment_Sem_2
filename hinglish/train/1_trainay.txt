 The Chief Minister's Office says that his condition is stable, so we are assuming that he is stable

 With these amendments, increasing the powers of the Income Tax Assessing Officer, a provision has been made that if a person fails to explain his income or expenses, then he should be taxed at the rate of 83 per cent
 sanshodhan se pehle yah seemaa mahaj 35 fisadi par thi
 These amendments in the tax rules have a direct impact on these five areas of income and expenditure
 in praavdhaanon se kendra sarkaar ke us nirdesh ko bhi dhakka laganaa tay he jisase usne tex vibhaag ke aankalan adhikariyon ko aam aadmi ko pareshaan na karne kii baat kahi he
 The Income Tax Act was amended to prevent tax evasion from those who deposit the banned currency of 500 and 1000 rupees

 In the event of not getting the proper details of inherited jewelery which can satisfy the tax authorities, once again the tax on you will be equal to the tax rate of the depositors of black money

 isse bachane ke liye aapako apane tex essesment officer ko paryaapt pruf ke saath dikhaanaa hoga ki kaarobaar ke liye jutaya gaya dhan kaledhan kii shrenee main nahin aata
 In the event of failure to do so, the same tax can be levied on your capital amount as proposed for compensation

 You may remember Rani Laxmibai by seeing Archana Jha, DSP of Raipur
 jis tarah unhone qamar main apane bete ko baandhakar dushmano kaa muqabla kiya tha, archana bhi kuch vaise hi apana kaam karti hai
 Crime DSP Archana of Raipur is an example for every woman who has to fulfill her responsibility both at home and office
 archana ke patibilaspur main kaam karte hai or aise main beti kii puri jimmedaari sirf or sirf unheen ko nibhaani padati he
 The job of DSP is not easy nor can it be done in one place
 par jis tarah archana ne apane kaam or daftar ke bich talmail bithaaya he vah ek misaal he
 Archana was pregnant at that time
 tabhi pradhanmantri raipur daure par pahunche the
 During that time too, he completed every task properly, fulfilling his responsibility
 archana ke ghar par koi aisa nahin he jo unki beti kii dekhbhaal kar sake
 But she does not turn her back on her duty
 raat main jab vah petroling par nikalati hai, to beti unki god main hoti he
 His dedication has made him popular on social media
 haalanki sabhi log unke samarthan main nahin hai or unke is kadam ko sahi nahin maanate hai

 There was a quarrel between the two on this day
 maamla darj karke isaki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 i want to stay forever, don't tell me anything, don't come when i want to go even after taking the angels of death
 aap umr ke 18wein saal main kahaan rahe, jab aapako matadhikaar hasil hua, jab aapako kisi vayask film main taak-jhaank karne yaa chupake se ghusane kii jarurat nahin rahi, jab college kii canteen main baanhen failaae 'aazaadee' aapkaa swaagat kar rahi hoti he, jab aap 'date' par gaye or old monke or coffee kaa swaad chakhaa?mujhe yaad he, main kahaan tha
 Like the crores of Indians my age, the summer of 1983, when i reached the threshold of being an adult, will be remembered as that glorious evening in Central London
 main thodaa-sa kismat vaala tha: 25 june ko jab vishwa cap khitaab antat: bharat ke naam hua to main lords main tha
 At that time i was playing league cricket in England and i had the dream of becoming a professional cricketer
 mere ek dost ne kaha, final dekhne chalate hai
 We did not have a ticket
 or tabhi, old traverd main semifinal main bharat ne england ko haraa diya
 Now the British were not interested in watching the rest of the game
 hamane match dekhne pahunchi rajkot ke prasiddh rajkumaar college ke ladakon kii cricket team ke jariye tikat hasil kar liye
 It was from this school that India's first cricket hero Ranjitsinhji came out
 1980 ke dashak main bharat banaam west indies muqabla bahut kuch 2015 main afghanistan banaam bharat jaisaa hi tha, ekadam vaisaa na bhi ho to kaaphi kuch miltaa-julata-sa tha
 The West Indies team was very powerful
 shaayad vah sarvakalik mahaan team he, us jaisi mukammal team aapane shaayad hi kabhi dekhi ho, jisamen richards kii mahanata, greenidge or loyad kii takat, dujon kii jaaduugari or sabase badhkar cricket ke itihaas main ab tak ke sabase dhardaar gendbaaj (chaaron ke chaaron!) hon, vah beshak aparaajey hi hogi
 Therefore, we thought that if our team remained at number two, then it is not bad to spend a day in this great field of cricket
 jab bhartiya team sirf 183 ran par simat gai to ham bhartiya team ke diwaanon ke us jhund main se ek purv test khilaadi yajuvendra singh ne sochaa, chalakar kuch kharidari hi kar lee jaae
 His brothers were to arrive that evening
 so, kisi test kii ek pari main sabase adhik kaich lapakane kaa record banane vaale yajuvendra singh ko laga ki ab to bas aakhri nattejey kii aupchaarikta hi puri honi he, isliye behatar he ki khisak liya jaae
 This may have been the worst decision of his life! This is the unique feature of the uncertainties of the game
 aap yah kayaas thode hi laga sakate hai ki usen bolt pachhad die jaaenge, federer ko koi 100veen rank kaa khilaadi haraa degaa, yaa real madrid kisi kolkata ke club se haar jayega
 Some things are considered impossible
 phir bhi, khuda kaa shukr manaaie ki asambhav bhi sambhav ho gaya, jabaki vishwa cap spardhaa kii shuruyaat main bharat kii ummid kisi bahari ke liye aadhi bhi nahin thi or iske pehle vaale vishwa cap aayojanon main vah sirf sabase nichle paaydaan kii east africa jaisi tiimon se hi jeet pai thi
 Seeing every small shot and wicket taking incident of that match, we get a lot of dramaticness
 shrikant ko dekhie, jo apane balle ko talwaar kii tarah uthaae endi roberts ko hook lagaakar chakka maar rahe hai, sandip patil ne laire gomes kii gend ko us stand kii ore uchhaala jahaan ham bear kii chuskee le rahe west indies ke samarthakon ke bich baithe the
 Syed Kirmani jumps to catch the catch, and more than that, Kapil Dev runs as if he is participating in a Haryanvi marathon and suddenly takes the wicket of Vivian Richards, as if he has hit the cup and the ground
 (1983 vishwa cap trophy ke saath kapil dev)mere liye vah mauka khaas tha jab ek saamaanya-se sardaar balvinder sandhu ne west indies ke duusare mahaan ballebaaj greenidge ko bold kar diya
 He was affectionately called 'ballu' and was my partner on the Mumbai ground
 ham aksar club match saath-saath khel chuke the or kabhi sochaa bhi nahin tha ki vah vishwa cap main khelegaa
 Nevertheless, he was in the biggest match and was licking the balls of the best player of fast balls
 sandhu apni ungaliyon ke ishaare par west indies ko nachaa paa rahaa tha, yahi dekhakar hamen lagane laga ki aaj kaa din kuch khaas he
 Despite this, in June 1983, it was not only impossible on the field, he had changed Indian cricket forever, and the country had also changed with the same power
 achaanak, ham main gajab kaa aatmavishvaas aa gaya tha
 The early years of the 1980s were filled with violent incidents
 punjab main ugravad kaa bolbalaa tha, puvarttar narsanhaaron se post tha, desh ke duusare hisson main dangon kii aag jal-bujh rahi thi
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's rule was questioned by corruption, license permit raj, alleged Hindu i
e
 slow growth rate
 yani buree tarah last-post bharat ko ubarne ke liye kisi chamatkaar kii jarurat thi
 The 1983 victory forever opened up the commercial prospects of Indian cricket
 us samay tak cricketron ko lekar vigyaapan virale hi banaae jate the
 The only exception was the appearance of Farooq Engineer in the 1960s Brillcream advertisement
 haa, 1970 ke dashak main sunil gavaskar ne super star kii haisiyat paa lee thi lekin ve mohammad rafee jaise gayak the
 India was waiting for the voice of Kishore Kumar, which was found in the amazing talented Kapil
 aap '80 ke dashak main cinema dekhne gaye hon to yaad karen ki kaise parade par kapil apni battisi dikhaate hue kehete the, ''pamolive da jawaab nahin
 Gavaskar was a hero, but Kapil emerged as a pop icon
 kapil ne bhartiya cricketer ko mahaj khilaadi se antertainer bana diya
 Cricket had prepared to enter the entertainment industry
 arthvyavastha kaa udaarikaran to 1991 main hua lekin cricket apane 'saamanti' ateet se 1983 main hi aaazaad ho chukaa tha
 Another contribution to this came from the advent of color TV a year earlier in 1982
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main cricket radio ke jariye aap tak pahunchataa tha
 Doordarshan started the live telecast of the match from 1975
 sachin tendulkar 1990 ke dashak main satellite tivi ke pehle sitare bane, lekin iske beej ek dashak pehle capils davills (kapil ke jaanbaaj) ne bo die the
 Even the smallest stars of that team are remembered once before every World Cup
 final main main of da match mohinder amarnath, eemaandaar koshish karne vaale madanlaal, karishmai saiyad kirmani, badbhole kirti aaazaad or sundar-se yashpal sharma vagairah
 a TV program was held in 2008, 25 years after that memorable victory
 puri team usamen ai, sunil valsan bhi aae jo team main 15wein khilaadi the or us toornament main ek bhi match nahin khel paae the
 But you can tell your grandchildren that they won the World Cup
 jaisaa main garv se kah rahaa hum ki 1983 main bharat kii us shandaar jeet kaa main chashmadid tha
 PS As soon as Amarnath took the last wicket of Michael Holding, we ran to the ground with a bad tricolor
 west indies ke kisi darshak ne hamaari ore bear kii can phenk di
 i picked him up and stuck whatever was left of the lips

 What is the matter? The CAG observed that the Bihar government had collected Rs 11,412 crore from the treasury on AC bills between April 1, 2002 to March 31, 2008
 ke bhugtan ke disi bill bheje hi nahin
 What are AC and DC bills? Government departments prepare an estimate of any expenditure and bill to withdraw money from the government treasury
 yah asi bill he
 After the funds are withdrawn, departments have to prepare bills detailing the expenditure and also provide vouchers
 yah disi bill he jise sieji ke paas jamaa karana jaruri he
 When did the CAG hint at the Bihar government? For the first time in its 2006 report when Nitish Kumar was chief minister
 sieji ne 2007 or 2008 kii apni report main bhi iskaa ullekh kiya tha
 How did the Patna High Court move the case? a lawyer filed a PIL on the irregularities

 The court ordered a CBI inquiry
 kya he sarkaar kaa rukh?sarkaar kaa daawa, yah maamla accounting kaa he, isliye ise vidhansabha kii lok lekha samiti ko bhej diya gaya he
 The government says the PAC is investigating this, the matter should not be handed over to the CBI

 No complexity, always lead with examples
 dhoni ke netritv main khilne kii ek cheez jo mujhe sabase acchhee lagati thi vah yah thi ki vah aapako kabhi aisi cheez karne ke liye nahin kahata tha jo vah khud nahin kar saktaa tha
 Dhoni retired from Test cricket after the third Test against Australia ended in a draw in Melbourne
 dhoni ne haalanki match ke khatm hone ke baad bhi sanyas lene kaa koi sanket nahin diya tha
 Dravid said, "the reality is that in his presence the senior group was going through a transition and young players were coming
" vah captain ke rup main kaaphi baat nahin karata or apane kaam se aapkaa sammaan jeetne kii koshish karata he
 He never retreats and leads by example and does not believe in speaking much
 ’dravid ne kaha ki dhoni ko chote shaharon ke khilaadiyon ke liye preranarot hone kaa shrey jaataa he
 The former Indian captain said, 'coming from a small city like Ranchi to captain India and play 90 Test matches
 mujhe lagata he ki usne captaini ke kaam ko or sammanit bana diya
 Dravid said that he was also shocked by Dhoni's announcement of retirement

 He said, 'I think it was not expected that he would do this in the middle of the series
 mujhe ummid thi ki vah siries ke ant main samiksha karegaa kyonki bharat ko agle saat yaa aath maheene tak test cricket nahin khelnaa
 Dravid said, "as far as i know Dhoni, if the series had not been lost, i don't think he would have made such a decision in the middle
" ’ dravid ne dhoni kii captaini style kii tarif kii or unhen aakraamak captain qaraar diya
 He said, 'he was never defensive while captaining India

 com / q2dgm8yevg — Karan Johar (@karanjohar) January 2, 2017 Some time ago Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar's film '2
 0' ke tiger launch ke maukey par bin bulaae pahunch gaye the or vahaan unhoneykshayaki kaaphi tarif bhi kii thi
 The funny thing is that Karan was hosting that event
 bin bulaae '2
 Abhay arrived at the launch of the first look of '0', on the other side, Abhay had also reached 'koffee with Karan' along with his wife Twinkle
 vahaan bhi donon kii dosti saaf najar aa rahi thi
 It seems that the friendship of the three will reach one level further through this film
 prem-vivaah, sautan dukh, dushman se chhutkaaraa, vaseekaran, vivaah main rukaawat, pati-patni main anban, prem sambandhi, manachaaha pyaar premavivaah, ruthe premi ko manaanaa, shaadi ke liye mata pita ko manaanaa, premi vaseekaran, premika vaseekaran, pati-patnivasikaran, sautan dushman se mukti ke upaay aapke jivan kii har samasyaon kaa pakkaa samaadhaan karne ke daawa karne vaale aghori baba na keval daawa karte hai balki 101% pakkaa samaadhaan kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 You will be surprised to know that these fake babas have also become hi-tech with time
 magazine or ishtahaar se alag in baabaaon ne soshal media ko apana nayaa adda bana liya he
 If you do not believe it, then search on Google and see how far the web of tantrikas is spread
 dilli or ensiaar main oparate hone vaali kuch websites ye hai jo insaan ke har ek mushkilon ko chutkiyon main hal karne kaa daawa kiya
 Not only Google and website but many groups have also been created on Facebook in which many babas have claimed to get rid of many problems including Vashikaran, Aghori
 buraadi maamle main 11 logon kii maut ke baad kai tantric or vaseekaran karne vaale baabaaon ne apana jaal-batta samet to liya lekin soshal media par ye bekhatke logon kii jindagi se abhi bhi khel rahe hai
 In Burari, it has turned into such a reality, rehearsalization of death, not having children, they not only redeem all the problems of common life, but also charge a hefty amount
 jab sakhti hoti he to ye ishtahaar se aajkal soshal media par shift ho jate hai
 After the death of 11 people in Burari, the way Aghori cultivation, Tantra Mantra and common life problems grabbed the game by grabbing their shop from the market, but their game is still going on indiscriminately on social media
 soshal media par aane se inke pakade jane ke khatra behad kam hota he
 It is not easy to track them on social media and Facebook
 adhiktar client se ye whatrup kol karte hai, narmal kaal to bilkul bhi nahin choote hai
 Their business runs not only in the economically weaker areas of delhi-ncr but also in posh areas
 baba kii khoj kii is kadi main hamane khoj nikaala ek aise baba ko jo kuch papers main ishtahaar dene ke baad inhen kuch log mil jate hai phir unhen chuunaa lagane ke baad phir ye apane kaam mekhad lag jaataa hai
 Our search for a Baba ended by going to the second floor at the Gupta Complex in Rajouri Garden where we caught a man named Ayush who claims to make every difficulty easy for people by locking up prayers in amulets but on camera he said Captivate does not do at all
 vaseekaran ke aarope par aayush ne kaha ki wo dua tabeez ke alaava koi kaam nahin karata
 He only gives equipment to the people for business or to make bad work
 aayush kaa daawa he ki dil se dua karoge to sab thik ho jayega
 The most important thing is that the person who gave the instrument said that there was no such tantric who could do this way to execute the incident of Burari
 desh main digital len-dene ko badhaava dene ke bich iskar vibhaag ne bhi is taraf kadam uthaanaa shuru kar diya he
 The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has prepared a proposal for this
 haalanki yah prastaav shikshan sansthaanon, aspataalon, parmarth or dharmik nyaason ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Through this proposal, there is an exercise to provide tax exemption or exemption to these institutions at the earliest
 iskar vibhaagane somvaar ko isko lekar jaankaree di
 The department said that rules will be revised for this reason
 haalanki sanshodhan karne se pehle is prastaav ko lekar anshadharakon se 12 november tak tippaniyan maangi gai hai
 The implementation of these rules will be considered only after this date
 kendriya pratyaksh kar board (sibiditi) ne apane bayaan main kaha, ‘‘jis tareeke se centre sarkaar digital india ko badhaava dene main juty hui he
 Similarly, the Income Tax Department has decided that the process of giving such applications in manual form should be scrapped
 prastaav ke mutabik is tarah ke aavedan ke saath company panjiyak ke saathpanjikaranki swasatyapit prati bhi deni hogi
 In addition to this, a copy of the accounts and the books of account will have to be added

 pradhanmantri ke notebandi ke elaan ke baad desh main afratfari kaa maahaul ho gaya tha
 When the ruling BJP called it action against black money, the opposition parties campaigned against demonetisation
 notebandi ke chand dinon baad desh ke kai rajyon main nagar nikaay or vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ne ek ke baad ek jeet hasil kii or vipaksh dalon ko baari nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In the civic elections, the Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chandigarh municipal bodies elections were held in the month of November, after a few days of fidelity to the BJP
 vipakshi dal notebandi ko mudda banaakar jeet hasil karne kaa khwab dekh rahe the
 But when the election results came, the dreams of the opposition could not be realized
 bijepi ko notebandi kaa siyaasi phayda mila
 In these states, BJP won more than before
 is jeet par bijepi ne kaha ki desh kii janata ne narendra modi ke faisle par muhar lagane kaa kaam kiya
 Loss to Congress in Gujarat BJP benefits: Municipal election results of 126 seats of Gujarat came on November 27, 19 days after demonetisation
 bijepi ne 126 nagar nikaay kii siton main se 109 par jeet hasil kii or congress ko mahaj 17 siten mili
 While the BJP had 64 seats in the 2011 municipal elections, the Congress had 52 seats
 is tarah congress ko baari nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa or bijepi ko kaaphi badhat mili
 The BJP won 893 seats out of 3727 municipal bodies in Maharashtra
 jabaki 2011 main uske paas 298 siten thim
 At the same time, the Congress and NCP suffered
 congress 771 se ghatakar 727 par aa gai or ensipi 916 se ghatakar 615 par aa gai
 Similarly, BJP also benefited in the municipal elections of Chadigarh
 chandigarh kii 126 nagar nikaay siton main se 20 par jeet darj kii or uske gathbandhan ke sahyogi akali dal ko bhi ek seat mili
 In the assembly elections, BJP got Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand Punjab only after four months of Fidelotbandi
 goa or manipur main vidhansabha chunaav hue
 The BJP won two out of these states
 uttar pradesh main notebandi kaa mudda is kadar haaavee rahaa ki sapa, basapa sahit congress ne har chunavi reliyon main uthaaya
 But the result went against all of them
 bijepi ko notebandi kaa phayda mila or chauthe paaydaan se pehle par pahunch gai
 The BJP won with record seats
 upi main mili bijepi ko aitihaasik jitupi main bijepi kii jabardast aandhi main duusare dal ud gaye
 The BJP performed brilliantly to win 324 out of 403 seats
 inamen se bijepi ne akele dam par 311 siten jiti, jabaki apana dal (sonelal) ne 9 siten jiti, or bhartiya suheldev samaaj party ko 4 siten hasil hui
 This was bjp's best performance ever in UP
 upi kii janata ne na sirf akhilesh ke 'kaam bolta he' ko nakaar diya, balki unhen notebandi ke virodh karne kaa baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Out of the total 403 seats, the BJP alliance on 324, sp-congress alliance on 54, BSP on 19 and 6 seats have gone to others
 uttarakhand main satta main hui vapasiuttarakhand main bhi bijepi kaa notebandi kaa siyaasi phayda mila
 BJP has won 56 seats out of the total 70 seats in the state, while the Congress had to settle for 11 seats
 haalat ye rahi ki do siton se chunaav ladane vaale mukhyamantri harish ravat donon hi jagah se chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Even after fewer seats in Goa, sarkargova's Congress account for 17 of the total 40 seats, while the ruling BJP got 13 seats
 maharashtravaadi gomantak party or goa forward party ko teen-teen siten mili
 Despite this, the BJP was successful in forming the government in Goa
 manipur main pehali baar bijepi sarkaarmanipur kii 60 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi ko 21 siten mili or congress ko 28 siten
 Naga People's Front and National People's Party got four seats each, while Lok Janshakti Party also got one seat
 jabaki 2012 ke chunaav main congress ko 47 siten mili thi
 In this way, the Congress lost 19 seats
 bijepi ne 21 siten jitkar sarkaar banane main safal rahi
 Despite all opposition campaigns, Modi calls demonetisation and GST a big improvement and calls it a surgical strike against black money
 bijepi chunaavon main jeet ko unke is kadam ko janata kii muhar hone kaa daawa karti he

 Where a woman reached the police station to file a complaint against a chicken
 police ne bhi murge or uske maalikon ko talab kar liya
 The mistress, who brought the hen to the police station, folded her hands and appealed to the police not to do anything with her hen, of course they should be put in jail
 darasal maamla kuch aisa tha ki punam naam kii mahila police thane main shikaayat lekar pahunchi ki uski beti ko ek murge ne chonch maar di
 The chicken was raised by a family living in the neighborhood of Poonam

 She started pleading with the police not to do anything with her chicken, of course she should be put in jail
 lakshmi ne bataaya ki jab yah chota-sa tha, tab vah paanch rupye main kharid kar laai thi or tabhi se use paal rahi he
 Lakshmi's husband Pappu Jatav said she had no children

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke maddenjar mangalvaar ko bijepi ne 39 ummidavaaron kii list jari kii, to loksabhaa kii seat par ummidavaaron ke naam dekhakar sabko hairaan hui
 According to bjp's candidate list, the seats of Varun Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi have been reshuffled and now Varun Gandhi from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh and Maneka Gandhi from Sultanpur will contest
 mana ja rahaa he ki kendriya mantri menka gandhi ne apane bete varun gandhi ke liye pilibhit kii seat chhod di he, jahaan se ab varun gandhi chunaav ladenge
 Please tell that Varun Gandhi is the current MP from Sultanpur, which is very close to the Amethi Lok Sabha seat and the Congress MP here is Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 menka gandhi ab apane bete varun ke sansadeey kshetra sultanpur se chunaav ladengi
 Although no reason has been given for the seat swap, sources say that the move was suggested by Maneka Gandhi herself, as she felt that Varun Gandhi could bet on his own by batting strongly in Pilibhit
 sutron ke mutabik yah suzav menka gandhi dwaara un ashankaon ke bich diya gaya jinke mutabik varun gandhi ko congress ke kaddavar ummidavaar se shikast mil sakati he
 Let us know that the Lok Sabha elections are to be held in seven phases between April 11 and May 19 and the results will be announced on May 23
 ab siton ke pherbadal ke baad yah tay ho gaya he ki varun gandhi ab maa kii raajnneetik viraasat pilibhit main chunavi maidan main apana damakham dikhaaenge
 This is the second time the mother has left her favorite Lok Sabha seat, Pilibhit, for a son
 yani ek baar 2009 main menka gandhi ne varun gandhi ke liye pilibhit kii seat chodi thi or duusari baar ab yani 2019
 However, sources are suggesting that Varun Gandhi's condition is not good this time in Sultanpur
 yahi vajah he ki haar ke dar se menka gandhi ne apni seat kii qurbaani di he
 In 2009, on a BJP ticket, Varun Gandhi contested from Pilibhit in place of his mother, in which he won
 2009 main hi varun gandhi vivaadit bayaan dekar bijepi ke fire brands netaa ke taur par ubhare the
 At the same time, in 2014, Varun Gandhi was given a ticket from Sultanpur by BJP, in which Varun Gandhi again won
 bijepi ne jo list jari kii he, usamen gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa seat se bhi ummidavaar kaa elaan nahin kiya gaya he
 Let us know that in the Lok Sabha by-elections held in 2018, BJP had to face a tough defeat from both these places

 Apart from this, he has participated in many painting competitions in Delhi, Mumbai and many states
 pankaj spray painting karte hai, speed mordan art, jo keval videsho main kii jaati rahi he
 No one in India can do this painting
 sabase badi baat to yah ki pankaj kisi bhi painting ko banane main keval 3 se 5 minute kaa samay lagaate hai or us painting main samaaj ke liye koi na koi sandesh jarur hota he
 Pankaj specializes in oil painting, pop art, woka painting, abstract painting
 ve ab tak beti bachaao-beti padhaao samet anek theme par painting bana chuke hai
 Pankaj now aims to win by joining a major competition
 pankaj sena main rahakar desh kii suraksha hi nahin kar rahe balki apane khaali samay ke dauraan painting ke jariye samaaj main aise sandesh ko pahunchane kaa kaam karte hai jo sabake hit main ho

 Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are embroiled in a separate dispute with 98 meters (due to heavy rains) approaching their full potential

 The NCA was formed to implement the orders of the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal

 The height of this dam was increased in 2017 but after this it is the first year when it can fill up to its maximum capacity
 agast ke ant tak madhya pradesh ke chikhalda or kuch anya jagahon main kinaaron par baadh aane ke saath pani kaa str 135 meter tak pahunch gaya tha
 The state had then lodged its protest as the water level should have reached 135 meters by September 30, as agreed
 samay se pehle baandh ke get band kiye jane se vahaan ke nivaasiyon ko baadh se bachaane ke liye hataane kaa samay nahin mil sakaa tha
 The Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA), the nodal agency set up to look into all matters related to the dam, told India Today that even if the Madhya Pradesh government had got another month, the government could hardly have evacuated the affected people

 The current Congress government in the state alleges that the Gujarat government has not given the full amount of compensation as per our demand

 How can she leave people to drown
 '' madhya pradesh main purv shivaraj singh chouhan kii sarkaar par bhi ungliyaan uth rahi hai
 Baghel asks, "the Gujarat government says that it has given compensation money
" madhya pradesh main purv bhaajapa sarkaar kahati he ki vah paison kaa upyog kar chuki he
 If this is the case then why are people still saying that they have not received compensation

 Looking at the problems related to government jobs, it seems that there is a problem even the youth themselves
 alag-alag bhartee pariksha ke noujvaan apni pariksha ke andolan main to jate hai magar duusari pariksha ke peedit naujavaanon se koi sahanubhuti nahin rakhte
 They should understand that unless such a transparent and reliable examination system is not fought for, this kind of media and twittering will happen
 sthaneey akhbaar chhap bhi rahe hai, magar chayan aayogon par koi asar nahin ho rahaa he
 Youngsters should also understand that the minister on Twitter is for his publicity and not for reading his problems
 uttar pradesh ke police bhartee board kaa qissa suniye
 In 2013, 11 thousand posts were recruited
 inamen se aath hazaar naujavaanon ne sari prakriyaayein puri kar lee hai
 Demonstrated several times but no effect on governments
 court se bhi mukadmaa jeet aae ki sabko niyukti mili magar kuch nahin ho rahaa he
 Staged a sit-in in front of the Police Recruitment Board on Monday but no result
 pariksha paas kar aath hazaar se adhik noujvaan dharna-pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Five years have passed
 sarkaar ke bheetar se kisi ko inaki baat sunani chahie or hafte bhar ke bheetar samaadhaan karnaa chahie
 Similarly, there is a case for the appointment of 12460 teachers
 in logon ne bhi kai dharna pradarshan kiye magar abhi bhi kai hazaar naujavaanon ko niyukti patr nahin mila he
 At least these victims should also have gone to the assembly of youths struggling for police recruitment and sepoy recruiters to picket BTC teachers

 On the other hand, the railway examiners are upset
 aapako yaad hoga ki is saal railway ne 60,000 padon kii bhartee nikaali thi

 is pariksha main paanch lakh se adhik chaatr paas hote hai
 Why does its result come out twice? Why didn't all the results come together? i do not understand chaatro ne trahimam sandesh bheje hai ki pehle paanch lakh vaale rigelt main paas ho gaya tha lekin 12 lakh se adhik chaatro kaa niklaa to fel kar diya gaya
 Whatever the system, why are they not told clearly
 ye kya tamaasha chal rahaa he?rivizd riselt kya hota he? ek chaatr ne likhaa he ki RRB PRAYAGRAJ board ne pehali baar riselt nikaala to 67,000 chaatr paas ho gaye
 Now the result has come for the second time, so many have failed
 chaatr relboard or rail mantri ko twit kar rahe hai
 They do not get any answer
 ye kis daur ke noujvaan hai jinhen itani si baat nahin maaloom ki mantriyon ne twitor par apane prachaar ke liye khaataa kholaa he na ki unki samasyaon ko pard kar samaadhaan ke liye
 Are these young people really not able to understand these things? So go and check the time line yourself, what kind of complaints people are writing and what kind of hearing is done
 mantri kisi shikaayat par diaper bhijwa kar media main vaahvahee lut letaa he
 Everything else remains the same
 ab aate hai media par
 Obviously, if the lives of young people are at stake, then they will kill everywhere
 tivi ke ankaron ko twit kar rahe hai
 Frustrated that the media did not show
 ab ek sawaal ve khud se puuchhen
 What do they watch on tv? Do you see how the government can do this when the news of other groups' sit-in demonstrations comes? When they do not see themselves, Hindus will continue to engage in Muslim debates, so why would this media listen to them? So overall, youth are turning their civil power into junk
 mere hisaab se unhen aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 It is also appalling that eight to eight thousand youth have passed the examination but the appointment letter is not available
 hazaron noujvaan paas kar chuke hai lekin unhen fel kar diya jaataa he
 It is not a matter of one state

 andhra pradesh ke hai court ne sarkaar ko aadesh diya he ki rajya main do dhamaakon ke baad galat giraftaar kiye gaye yuvakon ko kisi prakaar kaa muaavja nahin diya ja saktaa
 The court says that there is no legal basis for this

 Explain that the youth arrested in Mecca Masjid and another blasts were compensated on the orders of the Human Rights Commission after being found innocent
 court ne kaha he ki yah muaavja waapas liya jaae

 giraftaar kai yuvakon ne daawa kiya tha ki unke saath police ne hiraasat ke dauraan jyaadati kii he
 On the appeal of a citizen, the court ordered on Monday that the government has no right to pay compensation because a person is acquitted from the court

 The government has so far given three lakh rupees to 20 people, and 20-20 thousand rupees to 50 youths
 yah sabhi yuvak muslim samudaay se hai
 All these were granted following the order of the National Minorities Commission
 ayog ne kaha tha ki in sabhi ko maatr isliye nishaanaa banaaya gaya kyonki yah log ek khaas samudaay se hai
 All these people were detained from all parts of the city after the Mecca Masjid blasts
 in dhamaakon main nau logon kii maut ho gai thi or kareeb 50 log ghayal ho gaye the
 Some people refused to accept this compensation given by the government
 unka tark tha ki yah muaavja police adhikariyon kii tankhwaah se kaat kar diya jaae
 These people said that the police had committed too much with them in custody
 tippaniyan Some people say that compensation in this way will set a wrong precedent and this will affect the police investigation
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ab rajya sarkaar hoicourt ke is aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti degi
 This order of the court is expected to have a significant impact
 bataa den ki makka masjid or ek anya dhamaakon main giraftaar yuvakon ko bekasoor paae jane ke baad maanavadhikaar ayog ke aadesh par muaavja diya gaya tha
 The court said that this compensation should be withdrawn
 court ne kaha ki ab tak diya gaya 70 lakh rupaya waapas liya jaae
 Many of the arrested youths claimed that the police had committed excesses during their custody
 ek naagarik kii apil par court ne somvaar ko aadesh diya ki sarkaar ko koi adhikaar nahin he ki kyonki koi aadmi court se bari ho gaya he isliye vah muaavja de
 The court also said that the complainants are free to file a civil case
 sarkaar ne ab tak 20 logon ko teen-teen lakh rupee, or 20-20 hajaar rupee 50 yuvakon ko die hai
 All these youth are from Muslim community
 in sabhi ko rashtriya alpsankhyak ayog ke aadesh ke baad diya gaya tha
 The Commission had said that all these were targeted only because these people are from a particular community
 in sabhi logon ko makka masjid dhamaakon ke baad shahar ke tamaam hisson se hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 Nine people were killed and about 50 people were injured in these blasts
 kuch logon ne sarkaar dwaara diya gaya yah muaavja swikaarne se inkaar kar diya tha
 He argued that this compensation should be deducted from the salary of the police officers
 in logon kaa kahana tha ki police ne hiraasat main unke saath jyaadati kii hai
 The comments kuch logon kaa kahana he ki is tarah se muaavja diya janaa ek galat misaal aarambh kar degi or isse police kaa jaanch main bhi asar padegaa
 It is being said that now the state government will challenge this order of the High Court in the Supreme Court

 lekin ve isi par kendrit rahe ki modi kis tarah duniya main hindi kii dhwaja fahraa rahe hai
 Fueled by a long period of controversies, Chauhan compared Modi directly to Mahatma Gandhi and said that after Bapu, Modi is the second such Gujarati who is bringing Hindi to the global arena
 unhen spasht karnaa padaa ki sammelan hindi sahitya par nahin, bhashaa par he
 Sushma repeated the same thing
 yah chouhan kii majaburi thi, kyonki ek din pehle hi hindi ke pratishthit kavi rajesh joshi ne press conference kar sammelan main sahityakaron kii upeksha kaa virodh kiya tha
 He is resident of the same Nirala colony on Dushyant Kumar Marg where the well-known names of Hindi are Ramesh Chandra Shah and Dr
 vijay bahadur singh samet bhopal kii saahitiyik birdari rahati he
 But the doors of Makhanlal Nagar were not open from the heart for Nirala Colony
 pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main bhashaa ko lekar aresas kii paaramparik soch ko taak par dhar diya or kabir kii line “bhashaa bahata nir” ko pakadaa
 He said that Hindi should take useful words from other languages
 hameshaa kii tarah apni hi misaal pesh karte hue modi ne bataaya ki uttar pradesh ke dudhiyon ko chaay pilaa-pilaakar unhone kis tarah hindi sikhi
 Despite boycotting the program, Dr
 vijay bahadur singh bole, “bhashaa ko lekar modi ne jo kaha, vah thik he
 But there is a very strange argument that the conference is not on literature but on language
 bhashaa nishchit taur par lok se upajati he
 But only linguists, litterateurs, poets and linguists take it and take it to a new generation in black letters
 aise main bhashaa ke naam par sahityakaron ko na poochna, badmaashi he
 "joshi raised the question," The purpose of the conference is to spread Hindi in the world, so why Hindi conference in a Hindi speaking city like Bhopal
 ” darasal, videsh rajyamantri general ve
 K
 singh ke is tanj se saahitiyik birdari pehle hi bhari baithi thi ki “sharaab pine waalon ko nahin bulaayaa gaya he
 Well, Modi's speech and V
 ke
 The conference started after Singh's unwavering gratitude
 alag-alag sabhakkshon main videsh niti main hindi, computer main hindi, sarkari kaamkaaj main hindi, patrakarita main shuddh hindi jaise bahut-se vishyon par gupt charchaa hui
 Secret because journalists were barred from entering these halls
 koi chhadam rup main ghus jaae to alag baat thi
 On the third day on 12 September, Home Minister Rajnath Singh concluded the program
 bahut-se bhartiya or videshi hindi seviyon ko manch par sammanit kiya gaya
 Most of these people are not familiar with the contribution of Hindi speakers
 sammanit hone waalon main sabase bada naam prabhakar shrotriy kaa rahaa
 But he did not look pleased when India Today asked: “there have been many things but the real question is of implementation
 ” sahityakaron ko sammelan main uchit sammaan na milane par unhone bhi nakhushi jaahir kii
 The conference claims to have made many ambitious decisions regarding Hindi
 haalanki in faislon kaa charitra 1975 ke baad se har sammelan main kiye ja rahe faislon jaisaa hi he, jo jameen par na utar sake
 In this context, Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur, who created Indianism against the British, remembers what he said to Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi on the death of Munshi Premchand
 apni pustak vyomakesh darvesh main vishwanath treepathi ne ise uddhrut kiya he, “tumhen ek aadmi (munshi premchand) mila tha jo sachmuch tumhaari bhashaa (hindi) kii shakti ko pahachaanata tha, par dukh he, vidhaataa ne use chin liya
 Your language has great power and great potential
 ” yahi baat pradhanmantri ne bhi apane bhaashan main kahi ki ve hindi kii shakti ko jaanate hai
 But will they explain to their activists that the future of Hindi is in creating new Premchand and not on the litterateurs to hang the image of their leader and "hindi lover"? bharat ne davis cap asia-osenia group-1 second round mukaable main ravivaar ko uzbekistan ko 4-1 se haraa diya

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has now come in support of students protesting against the appointment of Gajendra Chauhan, the new chairman of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII)
 rahul pradarshnkaree chaatro se milane ke liye aaj pune sthit FTII pahunche
 Here he met the students and talked to them in detail and supported them
 chaatro ko sambodhit karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki agar aap 'unki' baton se asahmat hai, to wo aapako rashtravirohi or hindu virdohi bataate hai
 Talking to the students, Rahul said: -jo halaat paidaa hue hai, usamen aisa kya he, jisane aap logon ko is tarah se pareshaan kar diya ki aap sadakon par virodh-pradarshan kar rahe hai? or aap log aisa kya kar rahe hai, jisane sarkaar ko pareshaan kar diya he? -democratically if most of the students say that they are not accepted as president then they should not be there
 -ye bahut hi suniyojit tareeke se board main kiya ja rahaa he or iskaa uddeshy chaatro se unka adhikaar chin lenaa he
 -RSS ideology has been to advance the general people or thinking in a planned way
 -ye aapke skool main nahin ho rahaa he, ye board main bade paimaane par kiya ja rahaa he
 - You are putting a less capable man on top of everyone and the other man who is capable is not willing to live under anyone
 -bijepi main piem hi power centre he, vahaan saare faisle vahi karte hai
 -the question is how much strength are you willing to fight against such a situation
 -main aapaki is ladaai main aapke saath hum
 - In the conversation that is happening here, it is said that you agree with us and if you are not, you are crushed
 -logon kaa munh band karne ke liye vah aapako hindu virdohi or raashtra virdohi kehete hai
 - Why do you think they want only one ideology in this country? After all, what is the reason that they do not want to welcome different ideologies or thinking in this country? -aapkaa drushtikon pratirodh kaa hona chahie, sirf skool ke bheetar nahin, balki baahar bhi
 -no one is more powerful today than you
 -yah ek bahut hi romaanchak film hogi ki kaise samoochee bharat sarkaar 250 chaatro ko kinare lagaana chaahati he
 This is just a small fight, the real fight is one in which we have to carry forward the real ideology of our country
 -aapako is vakt jo zakhm die gaye hai, aapako usase mili dard kaa sahi istemaal karnaa chahie
 i strongly oppose the privatization of this institution and my party Congress will not support it either
 -hamaare desh kaa sabase safal shiksha santhaan ve hai, jo sarkari hai
 These include iits, iims
 -aapaki or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii soch main ek mul fark he, aapke liye yah santhaan aapke astitv kaa ek hissaa he
 For them, this institute is just a building
 unhen aisa lagata he ki gyaan sirf unke paas he, jise vah sabko dena chaahate hai, jabaki aapaki or meri soch yah he ki gyaan aapke bheetar he, jise baahar laana he
 Earlier on reaching the Congress office, Rahul also faced opposition from BJP
 unhen yahaan bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne kaale jhande dikhaae
 Actually, there is a demand of FTII students that Gajendra Chauhan is not eligible for the post of FTII President, hence he should be removed from this post
 ab chaatro ne rahul gandhi se madad kii guhaar lagaai he ki ve is mudde ko sansad main uthaaen
 Students persist in the demand to reorganize the FTII Governing Council
 haalanki ve centre sarkaar se apni maangen manwaane main abhi tak asafal rahe hai
 The students have written a letter to Rahul Gandhi, stating their issues and have demanded to reach the voice of the students in Parliament
 ucch shiksha sansthaanon par sarkaar kii dakhlandaazi or hamalon ke khilaaf chaatr rahul gandhi se apil kar rahe hai ki vah sansad tak is mudde ko le jaaen
 Recently Rahul Gandhi had raised his voice against the government's ban on IIT Madras' controversial 'ambedkar Periyar Study Circle' and last month the government lifted the ban from the APSC
 tippaniyan FTII students are hoping that Rahul Gandhi will help them in solving this issue by joining their issue
 isse pehle FTII chaatr 3 july ko dilli main soochna evam prasaaran mantri arun jetali se mulaakaat kar chuke hai, lekin is baithak main koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa
 The students alleged that they were being pressured to withdraw their strike and threatened to privatize the institute
 somvaar ko filmkaar vidhu vinod chopra or raju hiraani ne dilli main phir se arun jetali se mulaaqaat kii or institute ke mudde hal karne ke alaava FTII main suraksha badhaane kii maang kii
 The students now want to take their agitation to Delhi and a big rally has been organized in Delhi on 3 August

 chaatro se baat karte hue rahul ne kaha : -what is the situation that has arisen that has disturbed you in such a way that you are protesting on the streets? And what are you people doing that has upset the government? -loktantric rup se agar zyaadaatar chaatr yah kehete hai ki unhen vah adhyaksh ke rup main sweekaar nahin he to unako vahaan nahin hona chahie
 - It is being done in the board in a very planned manner and its purpose is to take away their rights from the students
 -aresas kii vichaardhaara suniyojit tareeke se saamaanya logon yaa soch ko aage badhaane kaa rahaa he
 - This is not happening in your school, it is being done on a large scale across the board
 -aap ek kam kaabil aadmi ko sabhi ke upar laakar bitha rahe hai or doosraa aadmi jo kaabil he, vah kisi ke neeche rahane ko taiyaar nahin he
 PM is the power center in BJP, all decisions are made there
 -sawaal ye he ki aise halaat se aap kitni majbooti se ladane ko taiyaar hai
 - i am with you in this battle
 -yahaan jo baatcheet ho rahi he, usamen kaha jaataa he ki aap hamase sahamat hon or agar aap nahin hote to aapako kuchal diya jaataa he
 He calls you anti-hindu and anti-national for silencing people
 -aapako kya lagata he ki ve kyon is desh main sirf ek vichaardhaara chaahate hai? akhir aisi kya vajah he ki ve is desh main vibhinn vichaardhaara yaa soch kaa swaagat nahin karnaa chaahate? Your approach should be resistance, not just within the school, but also outside
 -aapse zyada koi bhi aaj kii taarikh main taqatvar nahin he
 It will be a very exciting film about how the entire Indian government wants to shore up 250 students
 -yah sirf ek choti ladaai he, asli ladaai vah he, jisamen hamen hamaare desh kii asal vichaardhaara ko aage badhanaa he
 -you have been given the injury at this time, you should use the pain received from it properly
 -main is santhaan ke nijeekaran kaa sakht virodh karata hum or meri party congress bhi iskaa samarthan nahin karegi
 The most successful educational institutions in our country are those which are government
 inamen iaiti, im shaamil hai
 There is a fundamental difference in the thinking of you and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, for you this institution is a part of your existence
 unke liye yah santhaan sirf ek imaarat he
 He feels that the knowledge is only with him, which he wants to give to everyone, while your thinking is that knowledge is within you, which has to be brought out
 isse pehle congress daftar pahunchane par rahul ko bijepi ke virodh kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa
 He was shown black flags by BJP workers here
 darasal, FTII chaatro kii maang he ki gajendra chouhan FTII adhyaksh pad ke kaabil nahin hai, isliye unhen is pad se hataa dena chahie
 Now the students have requested Rahul Gandhi for help to raise this issue in Parliament
 chaatr FTII gavarning council ko punargathit karne kii maang par kaayam hai
 However, they have so far failed to meet their demands from the central government
 chaatro ne rahul gandhi ko chitthee likhakar apane mudde bataae or sansad main chaatro kii awaz pahunchane kii maang kii he
 Students are appealing to Rahul Gandhi to take the issue to Parliament against the government's interference and attacks on higher education institutions
 haal main rahul gandhi ne IIT madras ke vivaadit 'ambedkar periyar study cirkil' par lagaae gaye sarkaar ke pratibandh ke khilaaf awaz uthaai thi or pichley maheene sarkaar ne APSC se pratibandh hataa diya
 The comments FTII chaatr ummid kar rahe hai ki rahul gandhi unke mudde se judakar is masale ko sulajhane main unki madad karenge
 Earlier FTII students met with Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley in Delhi on 3 July, but no solution was found in this meeting
 chaatro ne aarope lagaaya ki un par apni hadtaal waapas lene kaa dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he or institute kaa nijeekaran karne kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 On Monday, filmmakers Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Raju Hirani met Arun Jaitley again in Delhi and sought to increase security in FTII besides addressing the institute issues
 chaatr ab apane andolan ko dilli le janaa chaahate hai or 3 agast ko dilli main badi raily karne kaa aayojan kiya gaya he

 cricketer se raajnneetijna bane navjot singh siddhu ravivaar ko kapil sharma ke sho par phir se thahaake lagaate najar aae
 But Sidhu's laughter does not appeal to his opponents
 navjot siddhu ke tivi sho main shaamil hone par akali dal ne nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki mantri ke paas janata ke liye samay nahin he
 Time for a TV show
 janata kahaan jaae or kisse mili?siddhu ke khilaaf offis of profit maamle ko lekar punjab or haryana hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhatane vaale vakil harichand aroda ne kaha ki vah aglaa kadam uthaane se pehle mangalvaar ko siddhu ke khilaaf darj gaiyr iradatan hatya ke maamle kii sunwaayee kaa intjaar karenge
 If the Supreme Court gives its verdict against him, he will not take any action on Sidhu's TV show for the moment
 lekin agar supreme court cesiddhu korahat mili to vah phir se offis of profit kaa maamla court main uthaaenge
 The petition filed by Harichand Arora was rejected by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on October 10 last year because the channel had closed the Kapil Sharma show Comedy Nights with Kapil Sharma
 vakil harichand aroda ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki siddhu ek cabinet mantri hai or vah paise kamaane ke liye kisi duusare vyavsaay ko nahin apana sakate
 The Akali Dal will take up the matter in the Legislative Assembly
 On this matter, the Akali Dal has said that Kisidhu's working for television show is to ignore the office of profit and other rules
 jiskaa maamla vidhansabha main uthaaya jayega
 Explain that the Punjab government has already given a clean chit to Navjot Singh Sidhu in this matter

 Punjab Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi was asked if Navjot Singh Sidhu's television show was obstructing the functioning of the government, his only reply was that if "he is making people laugh then what is wrong with him?" "
 gauratlab he ki punjab sarkaar navjot singh siddhu ko pehle hi televijan sho karne kii ijaajat de chuki he
 Because Punjab's Advocate General Atul Nanda suggested to the government that Navjot Singh Sidhu's working for television violates neither the Indian Constitution nor the Representation of People Act, 1951 and not the Code of Conduct
 punjab or haryana hai court ne ek vakil dwaara siddhu ke khilaaf daayar ek apil ko bhi khaarij kar diya tha

 Dalit class officers Drs
 rudra pratap singh varsh 2006 main pashupaalan vibhaag ke nideshak bane the
 After the decision of the Supreme Court in 2015, when the then government started demoting to bring the officers and employees who were benefitted from the reservation in promotion to the former position, Dr
 singh pashupaalan vibhaag main sanyukt nideshak pad par tainaat kar die gaye
 He is still posted in this position
 dalit samaaj se hi aane vaale ek anya adhikari rajendra prasad bijli vibhaag main mukhya abhiyantaa the
 Three years ago, he was also demoted and posted as Superintending Engineer
 vartmaan main rajendra prasad bijli vibhaag main adheekshan abhiyantaa ke pad par banda jile main tainaat hai
 On the basis of rank and seniority in the state, Dr
 rudra pratap singh, rajendra prasad jaise anusuchit jati (essi) or anusuchit janajati (asti) samudaay ke kareeb do lakh adhikari-karmchaaree varsh 2015 (dekhanr box) ke baad se padaavnat ho gaye the
 Now once again there is hope among these officers
 supreme court ke 5 june ke aadesh (dekhen box) ke paalan ke kram main centre sarkaar ke carmik mantralay ne 15 june ko aadesh jari karke essi or asti varg ke afasaron ko pramotion menaarakshanor parinami jyeshthata lagu karne kii raah khol di
 With this order, about 18 lakh officers and employees of UP working in government jobs boiled down
 aarakshan ke samarthak or virdohi donon 17 june ko apni-apni takat dikhaane lakhanu ke lohia path par utre
 After the Supreme Court's order, the Dalit agenda is clearly visible in the readiness of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Center to implement reservation in promotion
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhaajapa sarkaar pramotion main aarakshan ko lagu kar khud ko dalit hitaishi sabit karnaa chaahati he
 Political analyst and associate professor at Lucknow University, Rajeshwar Kumar says, "by promoting reservation in promotion, the BJP government also wants to create a contradiction in the possible alliance of the Samajwadi Party and the pro-reservation Bahujan Samaj Party, which demoted Dalit officers and employees
 ''haalanki, pradesh sarkaar main cabinet mantri or pravaktaa shrikant sharma centre sarkaar ke aadesh ke peeche kisi prakaar kii raajnneetik manshaa se inkaar karte hai

 Before the next Lok Sabha elections, the BJP government, which had been aloof among the Dalits, has now started seeking support for this section through reservation in promotion
 ucch nyaayalay main varisht vakil shailendra singh kehete hai, ''centre sarkaar ne bhale hi padonnati main aarakshan ke liye aadesh jari kar diya he par upi main isko lagu karne ke liye nae sire se kanoon bananaa padegaa
 At present, there is no provision in UP to give reservation in promotion to SC-ST category
 purv main jo kanoon bane the, ve court se nirast ho chuke hai
 On June 17, to save the state government, the Reservation Resistance Sangharsh Samiti marched in Lucknow
 samiti ke sanyojak avadhesh verma kehete hai, ''pronnati main aarakshan bill rajyasabha se paarit ho chukaa he
 Since 2012, this bill is pending in the Lok Sabha

 The Ministry of Personnel has said in its directive that the order of the Supreme Court should be clearly mentioned in each order of promotion
 varsh 2012 main supreme court ke aadesh ke baad anusuchit jati or janajati ke adhikariyon, karmchaariyon kii padonnati (pramotion) ruk gayi
 However, there was no order in this order to demote those promoted
 iske baad sinchai vibhaag main karyrat saamaanya varg ke adhikariyon kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne essi-asti ke kul do lakh karmchaariyon ko rewart kar diya
 The central government is facing allegations of misinterpretation of the Supreme Court's June 5 order
 sarkari naukariyon main pramotion main aarakshan or parinami jyeshthata kaa laabh dene kaa virodh kar rahe sanghathan sarvajan hitay sangrakshan samiti ke adhyaksh shailendra dube bataate hai, ''supreme court ne kanoon ke mutabik pramotion main aarakshan kaa laabh dene kii baat kahi he
 Since m
 nagaraj prakaran main court ke nirnay ke punarikshan kii prakriya chal rahi he, baavjood iske abhi bhi is prakaran main supreme court kaa nirnay lagu he
 Accordingly, the process of reservation in promotion has to be completed
 pramotion main aarakshan ke khilaaf maahaul banane ke liye sarvajan hitay sangrakshan samiti ne ek ranneeti ke tahat 17 june kaa chunaav kiya kyonki 23 varsh pehle isi din centre sarkaar ne 77waan samvidhan sanshodhan karke rajya sarkaar ko pramotion main aarakshan kaa adhikaar diya tha
 Now whatever rules will be made for reservation in reservation and consequential seniority, they will come into effect from June 17, 1995
 yani 23 saal pehle se varishthata suchi main badlaav hoga
 "if there is any promotion in any state from the circular of the central government, then it will be challenged in the Supreme Court, because it will be in contempt of court's decision in Nagraj case," says Dubey

 C

 "the government has already abolished the pension," says Dwivedi
 varishthata bhi khatm karne par sarkari naukariyon kaa aakarshan ghatega
 The meritorious people of ordinary and backward classes will turn their backs on it
 '' ab aarakshan ke virodh main janamat banane ke liye sarvajan hitay samiti ke desh bhar ke padaadhikari monsoon satr ke dauraan sansad bhawan tak march bhi karenge
 Backward reservation stakes In the promotion, the backward reservation is set to be staked to cut the BJP government's move to address the Dalits through the reservation and the resultant seniority and to take on the anti-socialist position on the issue
 40 varsh pehle 13 janvari, 1978 ko upi ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ram naresh yadav kii sarkaar ne ek aadesh se pichde varg ke logon ke liye 15 pratishat padonnati main aarakshan kii vyavastha kii thi
 This order remained in force for more than two years
 15 farvari, 1980 ko tatkaaleen mukhyamantri banarsi das ne pichhadon ke liye padonnati main aarakshan ke nirnay ko khatm kar diya
 In view of the cordial relationship between the SP-BSP, the Reservation Reservation Struggle Committee, which is fighting the fight to save reservation, is seeking to restore the order of reservation in promotions for backward classes

 On the other hand, obcs together constitute 13 percent of the total population of 63 castes but only 70 percent jobs are in their possession

 aapako lagata he ki jab aap cinema haul main jate hai to aap yun hi seat kaa chunaav kar lete hai
 But you will be surprised to know that this shows about your personality
 manovaigyanik hiromi mijuki ke mutabik ek vyakti ke dil or dimag ke andruni kaamkaaj cinema seat ke chunaav ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Mizuki believes that people who take a center seat in front of the screen are confident and decisive
 in siton ko haul main sabase best mana jaataa he or inke liye akasar advance booking karaani padati he
 Mizuki argues in support of his theory that it is necessary for a person to be determined and planning in advance
 agar aap screen se sabase peeche vaali seat lete hai to iskaa matlab he ki aap shanti priy hai
 But Mizuki says that if you choose a distant seat, then you are a bit bashful and you are afraid of being influenced by others
 jo log saamaajik taur par zyada sakriy hote hai or jinhen logon ke bich rahanaa pasand he ve screen ke thik saamne front ro vaali seat kaa chunaav karte hai
 According to Mizuki, because sitting on these seats, only and only the curtain appears
 or in siton kaa chunaav karne vaale log kisi se baat karte samay unase puraa conection banaate hai
 If you prefer to sit in the middle of the screen a little off the screen, it means that you need your personal space and you only feel inclined towards the people with whom you think you are
 Can live mijuki kii daleel he ki agar aap haul ke andar peeche vaali corner seat lete hai to aap aise shaks hai jo yah jaananaa chahta he ki uske aasapaas kya chal rahaa he, lekin usamen khud ko shaamil karne kaa aatmavishvaas nahin hota
 If sitting on the front corner is your style, then you are the person who accepts inconvenience and Mizuki cautions that people can take advantage of your weakness

 iske baavjood dra main jin logon ke naam didie ke flats aae, wo behad khush najar aae to vahiin jinke naam is baar dra main nahin the, wo maayoos chehre ke saath waapas laut gaye

 The DDA Housing Scheme draw was chaired by Aggarwal
 safal aavantiyon main sabase pehle physicli disabled category main nageshwar raav kaa naam aayaa, jinhen dwarka main HIG flats aavantit hua
 Similarly, in the general category, the name of Neha Mehta came as the first allottee, LIG flatmila in Dwarka
 SC category main pehle aavanti bane pradeep kumaar, jinhen MIG flats mila
 The joy of getting a flat was clearly visible on people's faces
 mandir maarg par sarkari awaas main rahane vaale praveen upaadhyaay or unki mummy ko rohinee main MIG flats mila, haalanki unhone HIG flats ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Praveen Upadhyay said that there is nothing greater than the joy of getting your own house
 haa ghar thodaa chota padegaa, lekin apana hoga isi baat se santusht he
 However, after the draw of the housing scheme many people were also disappointed
 saalon se aavedan karne ke baad bhi har baar niraashaa haath lagane se kuch log kaaphi maayoos the, to kuch aise the jinhone apni kismat ko agle saal phir aajamaane kaa iraadaa kaayam rakhaa
 Under the DDA scheme, successful applicants will be given an allotment letter within one month, after which 3 months time will be given for payment
 3 maheene ke baad pement nahin kii gai, to agle teen maheene tak 12% byaaj dar ke saath pement kii ja sakegi
 But if the flat is not paid after 6 months after the allotment letter is issued, the allotment will be canceled
 didie ke mutabik pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat di ja rahi aarthiksbcidi kalog is baar zyada se zyada phayda uthaaenge
 Being considered a flop, this scheme of schemedda can be called a flop due to many reasons
 pehla ye ki didie jin daamon main makaan bech rahaa he, usase kam daamon main ensiaar main behatar quality or connactivity ke makaan aasaani se uplabdh hai
 Secondly, most of the flats in dda's housing scheme were LIG, also those LIG flats which people surrendered in the 2014 scheme
 maujuuda skim main 11757 elayeeji flats main kareeb 10,000 flats pichhali skim ke thukraae hue hai
 On top of this, the DDA did not reduce the price of flats as per the requirement, despite the slowdown in the market, so the applications were sold for 90,000 but only 46080 people joined the scheme, this is the situation when DDA has locked the previous scheme locking period Abolished the condition of
 yani makaan nikalate hi log use open markent main bech sakate hai
 However, the DDA believes that this time the housing scheme has been plugged
 didie ne elaan kiya he ki 2018 march maheene tak 20,000 makaanon kii behatar houseing skim launch karne kii taiyaari lagbhag apane aakhri charan main he
 But due to the cold response received in the year 2017 scheme, if many successful applicants surrender flats, then there can be no denying the serious possibility of dda's impact on credit

 aspx?id=3069 To obtain the blessings of Ashta Siddhis and nine funds from Mahabali Hanuman requires immense devotion and continuous cultivation
 kehete hai ki tapasya jitani gahari hoti he
 The fruit is equally assured
 ham aapako bataane vaale hai ki aakhir kaise milti hai ye aath chamatkaari siddhiyaan or nau nidhiyaan
 
 
 The attainment of siddhis and funds is possible only by going to the shelter of those devotees Hanuman
 jaankaron kii maane to jivan main siddhiyon or nidhiyon kaa yoga banane main grahon kaa bhi vishesh mahatv he isliye aaj ham aapako kundali kii un grah-sthitiyon ke bare main bhi bataaenge jo siddhiyon or nidhiyon kii prapti main aapaki madadgaar ho sakati hai
 Which planets are associated with Siddhis and funds? - Mars is considered to be the master of mantra power and energy - It is from Mars that the power of austerity is available - If Mars is strong then one gets funds easily - but only then can attain Siddhi If Jupiter is also strong with Mars, if such horoscopes are being made in your horoscope, then only you will be able to get siddhis and funds easily
 iske vipareet kisi bhi sthiti main siddhiyon or nidhiyon kii prapti ke liye kadi tapasya or bhakthi kii apaar shakti kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 If you get only a fraction of the eight siddhis and nine funds of such Bhaktavatsal Mahabali Hanuman, then the whole life is restored, that is why the devotees wish these siddhis and funds from their God but before getting these miraculous siddhis and funds, there are some things to talk about
 It is very important to know
 siddhiyon or nidhiyon se judi jaruri baaten- siddhiyon kii prapti ke liye sadhana nahin kerani chahie- siddhiyon kii prapti apane aap ho jaay to ishwar kii krupa he- siddhiyon kii prapti ke baad vyakti uskaa durupyog karke paap kaa bhaagi banataa he- nidhiyon kii prapti ke liye prarthana kii ja sakati he lekin ye prarthana satvik honi chahie- nidhiyon ko praapt karne ke liye kisi bhi galat raste par nahin janaa chahie- agar ishwar kii krupa se apaar dhan yani nidhiyon kii prapti ho bhi jaae to uskaa achche mad main istemaal karnaa chahieto aap bhi sachche man se bajrangbali kii puja-upasna or dhyaan kiijie
 If Mahabali is pleased then you will also give a boon and you can get that boon in the form of siddhis and funds, but for this you have to make yourself worthy

 Shatrughan Sinha, the eminent cine actor and party MP from Patna Sahab Lok Sabha seat, while leaving behind the controversy arising out of angry remarks about the newly formed National Executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party, advised the party to focus on the assembly elections in its home state of Bihar
 is
 party ke star prachaarkon main shumaar sinha ne mangalvaar ko ek anaupchaarik baatcheet main party ke naye adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko apana chota bhai bataate hue kaha ki 'rashtriya kaaryakarini ke mudde par mujhe jo bhi kahana tha, vah main party ke adhyaksh or loksabhaa main party evam pratipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj se kah chukaa hum or is sawaal par mujhe ab aage or kuch nahin kahana he
 Simultaneously, Sinha insisted that he had not broken the discipline of the party in any way in expressing his feelings
 apane putr lav sinha kii pehali film 'sadiyaan' ke pramotion ke silsile main lakhanu aaye sinha ne kaha ki bihar vidhansabha ke mahatvapurn chunaav se pehle party ko aatmanirikshan karnaa chahie or gutbaji samaapt karke shashakt or ekajute hokar saamne aana chahie
 He said, 'in this election year, it is necessary for the party to solve all its problems from an organizational point of view and review the performance of the party in the recent assembly by-elections
 ' sinha ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii prasansha karte hue kaha ki mukhyamantri acha kaam kar rahe hai, lekin parinaam anukool na rahane se yah andeshaa swaabhaavik he ki kahin kuch kami he
 He gave the slogan of 'bihar Rising' instead of 'bihar Shining' and said that Bihar Rising is a better slogan, because many problems of the people of the state are yet to be resolved
 yah kehete hue ki ‘mujhe na to bihar diwas samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya or na hi mukhyamantri ke kaaryakramon main, ‘sinha ne apane khaas or mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki lagata he ki kuch log meri lokapriyata se ghabaraate hai
 On the controversy arising out of his statements on the new executive of the new party president Nitin Gadkari, Sinha said that his intention was only that the able and able bill should get their due place and the disabled should not get priority over them
 unhone sawaalon ke jawaab main kaha ki varisht rajaneta atal bihari bajpeyi ke sanyas or kuch anya kaarnon se party ke sheersh par shoonyata kii sthiti ban gayi he
 On the question of women's reservation, she said that with the intention of taking political advantage, some people have colored the issue in political color
 unhone kaha ki ‘mahila aarakshan jaise mahatvapurn vishay par vichaaron main bhed swaabhaavik he lekin sabhi dalon kii baithak bulaakar ek aam raay banane kii koshish honi chahie
 Regarding the different voices that emerged on the question of women's reservation in the ally party Janata Dal (U), Sinha said that this is not good, because it is natural to raise the talk of division within the party
 diggaj shaayar caphi azmi ne ek daf begum akhtar ke bare menkaha tha, 'ghazal ke do myne hote hai, pehla ghazal or doosraa begum akhtar
 "mallika-e-ghazal" is Padma Bhushan Begum Akhtar's birthday today
 rap or rimix ke jamaane main aaj bhi jis fankaar ko google bhi doodle ke jariye yaad kar rahaa aaie unki mahaan jindagi ke bare main jaane kuch khaas baaten:begum akhtar kii aawaaj recording ke behad shuruaati daur main darj kii gai ve swar lahariyaan hai
 His singing is synonymous with comfort and ointment
 kabhi-kabhi to hairat hoti he ki akhtari bai na hotin to chot khaae aashiq kya karte or kahaan jate
 Whose world of spiritual voice is still crazy
 
 
 *7 oktober, 1914 ko uttar pradesh ke faijabad main rahane vaale ek kuleen parivaar main us aawaaj ne janm liya
 The parents lovingly named it 'bibbi'
 bibbi ko sangeet se ishk hua 7 saal kii umr main, jab usne theatre abhinetri chanda kaa gaanaa suna
 He was initiated into classical music by the famous music of that time, Ustad Ata Muhammad Khan, Abdul Wahid Khan and Ustad Jhande Khan of Patiala Gharana
 'ye na thi hamaari kismat, jo visaal-e-yaar hota', 'i muhabbat tere anjaam pe ronaa aayaa' akhtari bai kii sabase mashhoor gajalon main se he
 * The year was 1930
 bibbi ab akhtari ho gai thim
 At the age of 15, when she presented the first Kalam on the stage, Sarojini Naidu, the famous poetess sitting in front, floated and was happy and presented her a sari
 is ghazal ke bol the, 'tuune boote e harjaai tuune boote harjaai kuch aisi adaa pai, takata teri surat harek tamaashai
 'finally after finishing Ghazal, she says with a teenage stare,' Mera Naam Akhtari Bai Faizabad '* Bibi very soon started singing Ghazal, Thumri, Tappa, Dadra and Khyal with equal rights
 aage chalakar hindustan ne unhen 'mallika-e-ghazal' kaha or padmabhushan se nawaja
 In India, sehra Akhtari Bai should be tied to elevate Ghazal singing based on classical ragas
 'divaana bananaa he to divaana bana de
 
 ', 'koyaliya mat kar pukaar kareja lage kataar
 
 ', 'chaa rahi gata jiya mora laharaaya he' jaise geet unke prasiddh geeton main shumaar hai
 7 classical stories of 7 maharathis * Begum Sahiba was respected by well-known people of the society
 sarojini naidu or shastreey gayak pandit jasraj unke jabardast prashansak the, to caphi azmi bhi apni gajalon ko begum sahiba kii aawaaj main sunakar mantrmugdh ho jate the
 In 1974, Begum Akhtar sang this Ghazal of Kaifi Azmi on the occasion of her birthday
 'suna karo meri jaan, inase unase afsane, sab ajanabeen hai yahaan, koun kahaan kise pahachaane'*akhtari ke paas sab kuch tha, lekin vah aurat kii sabase badi safalataa ek kaamyaab bivi hone main maanati thim
 This desire made him meet barrister Ishtiaq Ahmed Abbasi in Lucknow
 yah mulaakaat jald nikaah main badal gai or iske saath hi akhtari bai, begum akhtar ho gayi, lekin iske baad saamaajik bandhanon kii vajah se begum sahiba ko gaanaa chhodana padaa
 Inayat of the world broke his heart
 begum akhtarah gamgin-si ek aawaaj*gayaki chhodana unke liye vaisaa hi tha, jaise ek machhlee kaa pani ke bina rahanaa
 She could not sing for about five years and began to be ill
 yahi vah vakt tha jab sangeet ke kshetra main unki vaapasi unki girti sehat ke liye hitkar sabit hui or 1949 main vah recording studio lautin
 He sang three Ghazals and one Dadra at the Lucknow radio station
 iske baad unki ankhon se aansu chhalak pade or unhone sangeet goshtiyon kaa rukh kar liya
 This series started again, then never stopped again
 *30 oktober, 1974 ko begum sahiba kaa sharir duniya ko alavida kah gaya, lekin unki aawaaj kaa aane vaali pidiyon ko sukun bakhshane kaa ek qaraar tha shaayad, jo aaj bhi haath main yphone lekar ladke utyub par 'begum akhtar gajals' likhte rahete hai
 The Government of India honored the Begum Akhtar with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1972, the Padma Shri in 1968 and the Padma Bhushan in 1975 for her contribution to the arts sector

 Former captain of the Indian cricket team, Sunil Gavaskar has criticized the selectors for making Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh a scapegoat
 yuvaraj evam harbhajan ko nagpur test ke liye team main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 England beat India by seven wickets in the Kolkata Test to take a 2–1 lead in the series
 gavaskar ne enditivi ke kaarykram main ravivaar ko kaha, "yadi aap mujhase puuchhenge to jahir ko nikaalnaa sambhavit tha
 But in my view, Yuvraj and Harbhajan have been made scapegoats
 "tippaniyan Gavaskar said, "if you look at Harbhajan's performance in the Mumbai Test, he bowled some 20 overs (21 overs) and took two wickets

 Yuvraj scored more than 30 runs
 yadi aap unhen hataanaa chaahate hai to unhen bhi kyon nahin nikaala ja rahaa he jinhone acha pradarshan nahin kiya he

 " tison padak, unesco kaa kaling puraskaar, 1965 main padmabhushan oopaadhi or 2015 main sahitya academy puraskaar
 Jayant Vishnu Narlikar is a well-known face in the field of science
 1938 main janme jayant ne biechayu se padhai, cambridge uniwarsity samet kai badi sansthaaon se sammaan or uske baad tak kaa safar vigyaan se jude rahete hue tay kiya
 Jayant was recently awarded the 2015 Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Virus
 yahaan padhie jayant kii mashhoor kitaab virus ke aise ansh, jise padhane ke baad aap virus ke khauf ko behatar samaj paaenge
 When Jagtap came out from the number 153, a fraction of the virus book, the thoughts of running in all four directions in his mind were as if traffic was jammed
 ek vichaar-shrunkhlaa ke aage badhate-badhate duusari aade aa jaati thi
 And the reason for this was the chanting with the Prime Minister! The cold air welcomed him as soon as he came out of South Block and cooled his mind
 usne ghadi dekhi to ek baj rahaa tha
 He was to catch a four-fifty flight to Bombay
 basharte vah subah ke kuhare kii vajah se cancil na ho gai ho! car-park main uski hari gaadi khadi thi
 His driver Sardarji was spending time gossiping with the other drivers, but Jagatap quickly showed up as soon as he left
 ‘‘chalo palam!’’ indira gandhi anterrashtriya hawaii adda-itnaa lambaa naam lene kii bajaay dilliwasi abhi purana naam hi pasand karte the
 ''yes
 
 
 domestic par?’’ sardarji ne poocha
 "yes, at the Indian airline terminal," Jagatap noticed as the train started, the weather was improving
 india get saaf-saaf dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Palam must have opened now
 lekin vimaan sevaayen kuch to radd ho gai hongi or kuch ghante-do ghante kii deree se chal rahi hongi
 But due to the trunk route, the bombay-delhi airlines will not stop
 college ke notice board par pariksha ke parinaam ghoshit hote hai to unhen dekhte samay parikshaarthi kaa dil dhaddhadata he
 Narayan Vinayak Jagtap had been a smart student who always believed in his hard work
 isliye ghoshit parinaamon main apane naam ko khojane main na to use kathinaayee hoti, na chintaa
 But he used to shy away from reading the scheduled schedule of airlines in front of Jagtap Airport
 pataa nahin kitne ghante intjaar karnaa pade
 Even today, he read the letters written with chalk on a black board with the same blinding heart and came to know his life
 bombay janevaali flite abhi tak to samay par thi
 "why sir, how did you put a flight to Bombay on time?" And all the flights are running late? ”he asked in a funny tone at the check-in counter
 counterwala sukhi muskaan se bolaa, ‘‘bhai sahab, aircraft to deree se aane vaala he
 But we took the aircraft going to Banaras and diverted it to Bombay
 us par hamaare ministar ja rahe hai na?’’bahut khub! to ministar sahab ne banaras kii udaan hi hijac kar lee
 There are some benefits of traveling with ministers
 par bechaare banaras janewaalon kaa kya hoga? chalo! ol ij fere in lav and air trevel
 Thinking of this, Jagtap passed through the security towards the Departure Lounge
 vahaan use uske sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 "hi Nazya!" Where is it? ”A call came
 use ‘najya’ kehane vaale bahut thode mitra the, lambe arase ke
 He turned around and saw
 ‘‘ajay! tum idhar kaise
 
 
 Are you waiting for the flight to Bangalore? ”he asked, shaking hands with Ajay Maharana
 ‘‘nahin ji, abhi dakshin africa se laut rahaa hum
 
 
 There was a seminar
 par mujhe apane puraane bhai-bandhuon se milanaa tha jo vahiin bas gaye hai
 And i am going to Cuttack to report his mother
 divangat pitaaji ke yahi armaan the jo maine puure kiye
 But if this sister-in-law goes away! ”he said indifferently
 ‘‘kab he tumhaari flite?’’‘‘kab thi yah pucho bhai
 It was scheduled to leave at five o'clock
 security check bhi ho chukaa
 This flight will go to Bhubaneswar via Benares
 ab bataa rahe hai ki flite rishedul ho gai
 Why? God knows! ”said Ajay
 kaaran main jaanata hum, jagataap ne man-hi-man sochaa, par prakat main kuch nahin kaha
 If the reason is obvious then there will be panic
 usne kaha, ‘‘rishedul; yah ek nayaa shabd in bahaduron ne khoj nikaala
 Earlier used to say 'delayed'
 
 
 vimaan deree se jayega
 Now it is late, do not even want to accept this
 chalo coffee pien
 You tell me tales of South Africa
 ’’lounj main coffee-mashin thi
 But India is also a unique country to use manpower for self-service
 jagataap ne paanch-paanch rupye ke do token kharide jinhen mashin par niyukt vyakti ne mashin main daalkar coffee ke pyaale hajir kiye
 After tasting coffee, Maharana's mood was calm
 vah bolaa, ‘‘najya! jab mauka mili dakshin africa avashya janaa
 There is freshness and diversity in that country going through a state of transition, it may not appear after ten or twenty years
 
 
 ’’‘‘to vahaan ke kuch anubhav to sunaao! abhi samay he
 '' 'nazya! Don't rub it in bro
 samay to kaaphi he
 Well! It is a very long story
 
 
 jaisaa hamaare filmavaale kehete hai
 Ajay was in a mood to narrate his story
 ek ghanta kaise beetaa, pataa bhi na chalaa
 The sudden announcement of a flight to Bombay surprised both
 ajay se haath milakar jagataap uthaa
 There was a queue of passengers at the gate
 ekaek use ek baat yaad ai
 ''ajay
 
 
 tumhaare kai vivaranon main computer bigadane kii baat ai
 Is there a conspiracy behind it? '' He asked
 ‘‘najya! main kehane hi vaala tha par bich main yah deparchar kol kii ghoshnaa ho gai
 Well, in short, computerization is going on fast in that country
 par main yah maanane ko raji nahin ki computer kaa mizaaj kabhi-kabhi bighad jaataa he or us par nirbhar kaarobaar thapp ho jate hai, waisi hi ye ghatnaayen bhi thim
 Viruses were seen everywhere and this virus has been deliberately left in the computer network
 main visheshgy nahin hoon par computer kaa kaaphi istemaal maine kiya he
 On the same basis, i would say that a deliberate move is going to spoil the system of this budding country
 kyon, chaunk kyon gaye?’’jagataap ne apane aapako sambhala kyonki ajay use aashcharya se ghur rahaa tha
 Handling the thoughts that ran in his mind, he changed gear, "no, i suddenly remembered
 kya vahaan jane ke liye tumhen pile bukhaar kaa injection lenaa padaa?’’ usne poocha
 "otherwise," Ajay said
 par abhi uske chehre par kautuhal tha
 "when you talked about the virus, i remembered yellow fever
 main sooyee se hameshaa kataraata hum
 "" Abe your ancestors Maratha used to swords and you are afraid of needles? "laughing Ajay said goodbye
 lekin jagataap ne abhi uskaa haath pakad rakhaa tha
 He said, "but what was the result about that computer virus?" Was he under any conspiracy? Why did you think that it was spread with the intention of spreading anarchy in the country? "" This is just a possibility
 anyathaa itani alag-alag jagahon par ek hi tarah ke virus ke paae jane ko ham kya samajhen?’’ ajay bolaa
 There are enough hackers who sneak into computer accounts
 
 
 tumhaare paas koi saboot he ki iske peeche koi tagdi sajeesh he?’’‘‘saboot nahin, par jis tarah kaaphi baaten vahaan oonche str par gupt rakhi ja rahi hai unki badaulat to yahi lagata he
 
 
 Okay now run, you have to leave
 ’’boarding kii soochna flash ho rahi thi
 The aircraft workers were staring at the passengers
 jagataap get kii ore jhapata
 The aircraft flew in time to reach a height of ten thousand meters
 seat kii peti kholane kii anumati kii ghoshnaa hui
 But Jagtap was considering Ajay's story
 ‘‘kaaphi baaten vahaan oonche str par gupt rakhi ja rahi hai
 
 
 'ajay said
 uske bhai rajeev kii ek em
 P
 se kaaphi dosti thi-aisa ajay ne kaha tha
 It is possible that he came to know from there
 vaise aaj pradhanmantri ne sabhi se yahi kaha tha
 He was sworn in secrecy
 ‘‘
 
 
 Today, such a crisis has passed on the country
 
 
 ’’ pradhanmantri ke ye aarmabhik shabd use bhuule nahin the
 Did they get 'through official channels' similar news from other countries? The morning discussion session once again passed through his memory
 desh par sankat, vah kis prakaar kaa?padosi raashtra ke hamale kaa?andaruni vighatnkaaree tattvon kaa?aatankwaadiyon kaa?paryaay to kai the
 If the same is passing on other countries, then this crisis is not our own
 par jab tak bhalaa hamaare sar par he tab tak hamen usase nipatna to he
 And their experiences of the three army chiefs were a reminder of how fragile the situation has become
 unhone jo kisse sunaae the ve gahari chintaa jagaane vaale the kyonki aaj ke computer yug main-jahaan sabhi kshetron main kam-adhik taur par karypranali nishchit karne or us par niyantran rakhane kaa kaam ab computer karne lage hai-computaron ke maathe sanak jane par kya utpaat guzar sakate hai, iskaa anumaan bhi behad chintajanak tha
 Looking at the experiences of the army chiefs, it seemed that someone was making the security system of the country their goal
 ‘‘computer fail ho jane se hamaare sandeshon kaa simavarti kshetron se aadan-pradaan thapp ho jaataa he,’’ vaayu senadhish ne kaha tha
 The site and naval chiefs also nodded in agreement
 ‘‘to kya ab hamen raat ko chapatiyaan lekar daudane vaale sandesavaahakon par nirbhar rahanaa padegaa?’’ chidchidahat ke saath pradhanmantri bole
 He remembered John Masters' novel The Night Runners of Bengal
 
 
 1857 ke swadhinata sangram kii parshwabhoomi par likhaa hua
 Conspiracies of conspiracy against the British power were sent by such running messengers here and there
 
 
 chapatiyon ke madhyam se
 General Battara understood the context and said, "sir! That is not the case
 ham dedh sau saal ke ateet main nahin jane vaale
 When new technology — this modern computer-controlled message — is used, there is a possibility of deterioration sometimes
 parantu ab sthiti un aarmabhik durghatnaon se aage bad chuki he
 There is a conspiracy behind the computer craze
 ’’‘‘haa sar! ye galtiyaan hardware kii hai yaa software kii ye khoj nikaalane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Our experts say the virus has entered the entire computer system
 ’’‘‘virus?’’ pradhanmantri ne chakit hokar poocha
 "yes, i explain this," Professor Vinod Sharma, looking towards the Prime Minister, dripped in the middle
 kisi bhi charchaa-sabha main adhik der bina bole ve rah nahin sakate the
 The Prime Minister was very familiar with this habit
 kuch muskuraakar unhone anumati di or sharmaji ne apni vaakgadi oonche giyar main chadhaai
 "just as there are viruses and bacteria that interfere with the natural biological activity occurring in the body of the creatures, so are the computer programs that interfere with the logical functioning of the computer, they are also called viruses
 in program yani computer ko die gaye ajna-patr ke madhyam se computer kii sucharu karypranali badali ja sakati he
 "virus penetration" began in the 1980s-90s
 isi dashak main computaron kii lokapriyata teji se badi
 The computer entered the common man's house after tearing down the walls of large offices and scientific laboratories
 apane dainik kaaryon main bhi yah bandaa kaam aa saktaa he, isaki jaankaree janamanas main failane lagi or aise kaaryon ke liye computer ko die janevaale program yaa aagyaptr likhane kaa nayaa maahaul uth khadaa hua
 The copyright questions also arose as these certificates began to fetch a higher price due to their suitability
 gayak kii casette bazaar main aati he to use copy karke bechnaa copirite act kaa ulanghan mana jaataa he
 The original promissory writers used viruses to overcome the braves sold by copying computer mandates
 jo gaiyrkanoonee dhang se ajna-patr copy karte the ve ek virus ko bhi us ajna-patr main ghusaa pate the! or yah virus unke computer ke anya ajna-patron main bhi fail jaataa tha
 In short, it was a punishment for unlawful use
 ulate yadi roylty kii keemat chukaakar vah computer program istemaal hota tha to usamen virus apana prabhaav nahin dikhaa paata
 "but this matter is not limited here
 jab ek personal computer main virus ghus jaataa he to vah usamen daali disket yaa flopy discs par bhi aa jaataa he
 Then if the diskette is used on any other computer then the virus also enters there
 yah sansargajnya rog shaayad ab network ke madhyam se or bhi dur pahunch jaataa he kyonki network main dur ke computer bhi ek shrinkhalaa main jud jate hai
 '' 'professor Sharma! You threw light on the basic question in your own simple way, but Admiral Sir wants to know where the virus that had caused him came from, "dr
 the mild satire contained in the gentle words of the Prime Minister
 ramachandran kii kakadrushti se nahin chuta! jagataap kii ore dekhakar unhone halki muskuraahat ke saath ankhen michakaayi
 In fact, Jagtap used to respect Sharma and Ramachandran
 lekin karmath hote hue bhi donon shaskeey maahaul main ek-duusare ko nicha dikhaane ko kyon utsuk rahete hai, yah vah ab tak nahin samaj sakaa tha
 Earlier, there used to be an atmosphere of competition and jealousy among two talented musicians, writers, painters in the court
 
 
 kya vaigyanik bhi aisi maanviya bhaawanaaon se pare nahin rah sakate? usne swayan in donon hastiyon se mitrataa nibhaane kii niti apanaai thi, lekin uskaa fal use, durbhaagya se, sheeghra hi milane vaala tha
 The Prime Minister continued, "
" 
 
 virus ke bare main main computer kshetra ke jane-maane visheshgy sabyoda se tippanee sunanaa chahta hum
 '' 'sabyoda,' 'i
e
 Sabyasachi Babu or Sabyasachi Mukhopadhyay was famous for his reflex in gossip, in general discussion
 para yadi koi unhen apana mat sunaane kaa aahvaan kare to spasht bolne se kataraate nahin the
 On the Prime Minister asking, he said: "prime Minister, i am hearing about this virus for the first time
 senadhyakshon kii baaten sunakar yah to siddh he ki yah koi anoothaa virus he jisaki jaanch karnaa nihaayat jaruri he
 As Sharma explained, the virus spreads through a floppy or diskette
 par yahaan hamen network par se failanevaali mahamari par kaabo karnaa he
 We first have to see how to get rid of the entrapped virus
 phir yah jaananaa he ki yah pattha-top security ke baavjood andar ghusaa kaise, taaki aisa phir na hone paae
 The third thing is to find out which person or institution or country has manipulated us
 ’’sabyoda itnaa kahkar chup hue
 It was a long speech for a reticent like him
 jagataap ne kuch kehane kii anumati ke liye haath uthaaya
 Prime Minister's attention was attracted to him
 or bolne ko utsuk sharmaji ko dabaakar unhone jagataap se bolne ko kaha
 "I would like to say that if this virus is spread over the network, then it is likely to come through the route of electronic mail
 aaj i-mail ke itane network hai jo desh ko jod chuke hai
 Can you get the information from high level and confidential way that such difficulties are being felt in other countries as well
 
 
 shaayad ve bhi hamaari tarah hi peedit hai or gopneeyata kii vajah se hamen unki jaankaree na ho,’’ narayan bolaa
 "narayan's advice is worth considering," Ramachandran said, "unfortunately many nations are facing nation-wide terrorists
 kaaran alag-alag ho sakate hai
 But in such an environment, an international organization making money from the past will be doing this by making virus
 ham to jaanate hai ki chhipe taur par gaiyrkanoonee dhang se shastrastron kaa aayaat-niryaat hota he
 It is possible that the virus has also come in it! "" Professor Ramachandran seems to be James Bond or Dr
 phu maanchu kii kahaniyaan padhakar aae honge,’’ sharmaji bole
 Sometime back Ramachandran rubbed his eyes, this fact was not hidden from Sharma's eyes
 sharmaji kii tippanee par hansi-tahaakon ke pravaah main jagataap kii soochna kahin se kahin bah gai
 Now, while going to Bombay, Jagatap saw a lot of strength in him while reconsidering that information
 ajay maharana ke dakshin africa anubhav uski pushti karte the
 Computers shut down or faded
 
 
 aaj yahaan, kal vahaan
 
 
 Today on a lesser scale then tomorrow more widely
 
 
 kya ye ghatnaayen alag-alag keval ittefaq se ho rahi thim yaa unke peeche kisi shakti kii prerana thi
 
 
 Any negative power? Terrorism also spreads like this and sometimes when its widespread appearance comes, it is too late
 kya aaj kii ye sfoot ghatnaayen kal vishwa ko nestnabud karne kii purv suchanaaen to nahin?vimaan main jalpan dena armbh ho gaya tha
 Passengers were engaged in food, drinking, or reading something
 vaataavaran itnaa saadhaaran tha ki jagataap ko laga ki uske vichaar satya-sristi ko chhod kahin bhatak to nahin rahe? khayr, ab vimaan dilli se bombay ja rahaa tha, to use bhi dilli ke vichaar chhod bombay kii baton par sochna uchit tha
 The issue for which he was going to Bombay was also going to prove quite colorful
 jagataap ne apane brifces se si
