 After contesting the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections from West Champaran in my hometown Bihar, i have now decided that i will never contest again
 jha ne kaha, ‘bhartiya raajnneeti kii hamen koi samaj nahin he
 Now i will never contest elections
 sansad main saansad ke taur par pahunchnaa chahta tha taaki desh main vyaapt samasyaon ko uthaa sakuun
 i can do something for the backward areas of Bihar
 lekin ab mujhe samaj main aa gaya he ki main apane uddeshy ko film ke madhyam se hi behatar dhang se hasil kar saktaa hum

 upi kii janata kaa janadesh saaf or sidhaa lekin siem chune jane kii raah utani hi uljhi hui or tedi medhi he
 After the announcement of the results on March 11, BJP won 325 seats, so it seemed that there was no hurdle to form a government in UP
 lekin yahi jeet upi sarkaar ke liye ek cheharaa dhundne main deree kii sabase badi vajah ban gai
 Among all the names, Manoj Sinha's name has gone to the forefront in the list of qualifications required to command UP
 wo factor jo manoj sinha kii profile ko upi siem kii daavedaari main unhe aage nikaal le gaye
 
 
 Manoj Sinha is an MP from Ghazipur, the parliamentary seat next to Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the first Minister of State for Railways and now handling the Ministry of Communications as independent charge
 -manoj sinhaparaformens ke hisaab se piem modi ke priy mantri rahe hai, jo chupchaap apana kaam karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Sinha is considered to be the most fit in Modi and Amit Shah's plan and Manoj Sinha can walk fast on the road of development
 jo mishan 2019 ke liye jaruri he
 Manoj Sinha has been elected MP from Ghazipur thrice
 yani purvanchal ke anbhavi netaa he
 They are from Bhumihar caste, which does not have much influence in UP politics
 yani baaki jatiyon ke bich unke chunaav ko lekar aapasi dwand kam hoga
 -manoj Sinha has also stayed away from controversies, and there has never been any conflicting statement
 upi ke gajipur kaa ek gaanv mantri ke baad mukhyamantri kaa gaanv banane vaala he
 People of Mohanpura are praying that Manoj Sinha be crowned
 varanasi ke biechayu, jahaan se manoj sinha ne chaatr raajnneeti kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Old friends are waiting for this big decision
 -gaanv ke hi praathmik skool se padhai kii shuruyaat hui
 - He had a special interest in mathematics and science subjects
 aage kii padhai janapad ke rajkeey city inter college main hui
 Uma Shankar Gupta, a schoolmate of Manoj Sinha, recalls the childhood days that he came in contact with VHP during the days of City Inter College
 intermediat kii pariksha pratham shrenee paas hone ke baad manoj sinha ne biechayu se beatech kii padhai kii
 His interference in politics increased a bit here, and in 1982 he was also elected President of BHU Students Union
 padhai puri karne ke baad naukari kii bajaay raajnneeti main aa gaye
 Manoj Sinha's family came to Varanasi during his studies, so he has a deep affection for Varanasi
 manoj sinha ko raajnneeti main apane pita se viraasat main mili unke pita skool main principal the lekin samaaj seva or raajnneeti main sakriy rahete the
 Manoj Sinha has done a lot of work to increase the rail network in Ghazipur
 ab unke siem kii ummidavaari ke saath purvanchal ke logon kii ummiden or bhi bad gai hai
 The decision by the government to appoint Lieutenant General Bikram Singh as the next Army Chief has been challenged in the Supreme Court
 yachika daayar karne waalon main sena ke kai purv adhikari or beurocrates bhi shaamil hai
 The petitioners include Admiral Ramdas, former Chief Election Commissioner N
 Gopalaswamy, senior journalist Sama Rajappa and M
K
 ji devasasham shaamil hai
 In a petition of 60 pages, Lieutenant General Vikram Singh is also accused of being involved in a fake encounter in Jammu in 2001
 leftinent general singh par yah bhi aarope he ki congou main sanyukt raashtra shanti sena kaa netritv karte hue unhone apane maatahat adhikariyon par niyantran nahin rakhaa
 While the fake encounter case is pending in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, the army is investigating the Congo case itself
 gauratlab he ki 3 march ko sarkaar ne sanshay ke badalon ko hataate hue leftinent general bikram singh ko 31 may se aglaa senadhyaksh banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 He will replace General VK Singh
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main narendra modi kii 'tsunami'' main congress ko mili karaari haar ne party netaaon ko andar tak hilaakar rakh diya he
 Senior party leaders are finalizing the model of being made an executive chairman in the event that Rahul Gandhi remains adamant on not withdrawing his resignation from the post of Congress president
 rahul ke vikalp ke liye buudhvaar ko party ke varisht netaa eke antni kii adhyakshata main baithak ho rahi he
 It has many names including Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia to Priyanka Gandhi and Ashok Gehlot
 jinamein se kisi ek ko kaaryakari adhyaksh banaaya ja saktaa he
 Actually, by appointing a new working president in the Congress, the party will be able to reduce some of the workload from the shoulders of Rahul Gandhi
 iske alaava kaaryakari adhyaksh jahaan din-pratidin ke kaam par focus rakhenge to vahiin rahul gandhi party kaa kayakalp karne kii koshishon or bade lakshya kii ore dhyaan kendrit kar sakate hai
 This is the reason why there is constant churn in the party regarding the name of Rahul's new successor
 sachin payalatcongress ko kareebi se dekhne waalon ke anusaar congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke taur par sachin payalat kaa naam sabase aage he
 Pilot is known as a vocal speaker and a grounded leader
 vah 41 saal ke hai or yuvaaon ko party se jodne main ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Apart from this, he is also known as a Congress loyalist and is the son of late Rajesh Pilot, a veteran leader of the party
 bataa den ki 2013 main congress ko rajasthan main mili karaari haar ke baad party ko dobaaraa se khadaa karne ke liye sachin payalat ko pradesh adhyaksh banaakar rajasthan bheja gaya tha
 Pilot's five years of hard work resulted in the Congress coming back to power with his face in the 2018 assembly elections, but the party high command crowned the chief ministerial post Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot was made deputy CM
 sachin payalat ko rahul kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, if he is appointed as the Congress Working President, he can play an important role in the rejuvenation of the party
 ashok gahalotrajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kaa naam bhi kaaryakari adhyaksh kii daud main he
 Gehlot is as loyal to Rahul Gandhi as Ahmed Patel has been to Sonia Gandhi
 congress main gahalot kii sweekaaryata he
 He has a tremendous rapport with regional satraps like Captain Amarinder Singh, Kamal Nath and Ashok Chavan
 gahalot ko ek hardkor sanghathan main ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Apart from being a Chief Minister and a Member of Parliament, Gehlot has held many positions, ranging from the President of the State Congress Committee and the General Secretary of the All India Congress to the Secretary General of the Organization
 gahalot 2017 main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main prabharee the, jahaan bijepi ko jeetne main congress ne nako chane chabava die the
 Apart from this, last year he played an important role in the formation of congress-jds government in Karnataka
 jyotiraditya sindhiyacongress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke taur par rahul gandhi ke kareebi maane jane vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya kaam naam bhi he
 Scindia does not have great political stature, so Gandhi and Nehru can be fit and fit for the family
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main unka jis tarah se pradarshan rahaa he, use dekhte hue unki raah main mushkil ho sakati he
 Scindia was in charge of UP, where the party performed poorly and also lost on the Guna seat
 isse bhi badi baat yah he ki madhya pradesh main congress ke gutbaji kaa ek centre maane jate hai
 If any of Kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia are seen moving closer to the High Command, then the other faction will stall in its path
 priyanka gandhi wadracongress kaaryakari adhyaksh ke taur par priyanka gandhi wadra kaa naam res main he, gandhi-nehru parivaar ke lihaaj se yah naam ekadam sahi vikalp he
 In such a situation, Congress leaders can welcome the command of another Gandhi
 priyanka gandhi main bahut kuch he
 She is young and directly connected with the activists and the best thing is that the spots are counter-productive but have not been able to show any significant impact in the Lok Sabha elections
 priyanka zyaadaatar apni maa sonia gandhi or bhai rahul gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra main hi sakriy rahi hai
 So the question is, will she aspire to become a full-time politician? The second obstacle in Priyanka Gandhi's path is that her husband Robert Vadra is facing economic crime cases
 in saare aaropon ko lekar bijepi wadra ke bahaane gandhi parivaar ko gherte rahi he
 In such a situation, will Priyanka Gandhi take charge of the Congress? iske alaava congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne priyanka ko adhyaksh banaae jane ke khilaaf hai
 Apart from these four names, there are many names as working presidents of Congress
 inamen jairam ramesh, ahamed patel, gulam nabi aaazaad or digvijay singh shaamil hai
 If such a party decides to elect a working president, then who will be elected? It will be interesting to see

 In her address during the inaugural session of the Indian Science Congress, Mamta said that i am proud to say that Bengal is the brain of science in India and the people of the state have done everything from science to literature and art to music
 have contributed
 raashtrapati mukherjee kii prashansa karte hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki hamaare raashtrapati bhi maati ke sapoot hai

 The sage is still 20 years old and is meeting people who took part in the Second World War

 He also left school for several days to interview those veterans

 After that, they give the recordings to their family members
 unka kahana he ki time bahut kam bachaa he or abhi tak ham 400 se adhik sainikon ko kho chuke hai
 He says that after every soldier there are many things and information related to history and if a person dies, then we will lose a lot

 mamata banerjee or unke vittamantri amit mitra ke saath mangalvaar ko rajdhani dilli main dhakkamukki or badasluki kii ghatana kii pashchim bengal ke rajyapal emke naranayan ne kadi ninda kii he
 The governor issued a press release saying, "the regrettable and premeditated attack on the Chief Minister of West Bengal and other ministers in the national capital is very unfortunate and a blot on India's democratic values
" is vaakye kii tikhe se tikhe shabdon main ninda kii jaani chahie
 Those responsible for the attack and those who instigated them have lost their right to work within a democratic frameworks
 loktantric dhang se chuni hui mukhyamantri, vittamantri or unke mantriyon par hua is tarah kaa hamalaa bharat ke aadhunik itihaas main apurv he or itnaa gambhir he ki is par sipiem ke paulitte beuro ko aam maafee maangani chahie
 In the meantime, i urge the Trinamool activists and all the people of West Bengal to maintain peace and not get carried away by emotions
 " Here, the CPM has also condemned the attack on Mamta and Mitra
 sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha he ki party is ghatana kii jaanch karegi, lekin unhone trinmul congress ke kaaryakartaaon dwaara rajya bhar main left partiyon ke daftaron par hamalon kii bhi ninda kii he
 It is noteworthy that the Left parties held a protest against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday in Delhi over the death of Sudipto Gupta, an activist of SFI
 isi dauraan, pradarshnakariyon ne rajya ke vittamantri amit mitra se hathapayee bhi kii
 His clothes ripped off during the scuffle
 tippaniyan a group of protesters from the Left organizations were waiting for the Trinamool Congress chief outside the Commission's office
 mukhyamantri jab mitra ke saath paune chaar baje ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia se milane pahunchin, to pradarshnakariyon ne unke khilaaf naare lagaae
 Mamta was advised by the police not to get out of her car and go inside, but the Chief Minister preferred to go inside the building amid protesters shouting slogans and waving placards
 esefai or makapa ke sadasyon ne 'mamata banerjee hai-hai, trinmul congress hai-hai, hatyari mamata shame karo' ke naare lagaae
 Angry Chief Minister entered inside the building saying that it was rude behavior
 unhone kaha, aapako maaloom he ve kyon pradarshan kar rahe hai
 i have one million people with me
 main unhen dilli laa sakati hum
 They do not want the development of West Bengal
 
 
 baad main mamata banerjee ne sehat bigadane kaa hawala dete hue pradhanmantri ke saath apni mulaakaat radd kar di thi
 Mamta also canceled her proposed meeting with p Chidambaram on Wednesday and decided to return to Kolkata
 rajyapal ne ek press relies jari kar kaha, "rashtriya rajdhani main pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or duusare mantriyon par hua afsosna or purvaniyojit hamalaa behad durbhagyapurna he or bharat ke loktantric mulyon par ek dhabba he
 This sentence should be condemned in sharp words
 jo hamale ke liye zimmedaar hai or jin logon ne unhen uksaaya, ve ek loktantric chaukhate ke bheetar kaam karne kaa haq kho chuke hai
 This kind of attack on the democratically elected Chief Minister, Finance Minister and his ministers is unique in the modern history of India and is so serious that the cpm's Politburo should apologize on this
 is bich, main trinmul ke kaaryakartaaon or pashchim bengal ke sabhi logon se aagrah karata hum ki ve shanti banaae rakhen or bhaawanaaon main na bahen
 " idhar, sipiem ne bhi mamata or mitra par hamale kii ninda kii he
 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury has said that the party will investigate the incident, but has also condemned the attacks on the offices of left parties across the state by Trinamool Congress workers
 ullekhneey he ki esefai ke ek kaaryakarta sudipto gupta kii maut ko lekar vampanthi dalon ne dilli main mangalvaar ko pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya

 baaqi ke sabhi siton par agar pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam ko dekhe to nishchit rup se jahaan ek loksabhaa seat samastipur main algepi kaa palada baari he to nathanagar , belahar or simari baktiyarpur main janata dal united ke ummidavaaron kaa
 Talk about the Kishanganj seat, it has been the stronghold of the Congress party and there is hardly any chance of any upsurge here
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main darunda seat or jahaan janata dal united ko 26987 vot kaa badhat thi or us samay ummidavaar kavita singh thi jinke pati ajay singh abhi vidhaan sabha main party ke ummidavaar hai, ke bare main kaha jaataa hai ki unhone aadha darjan logon ko loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan madad ke badale vidhaan sabhachunaav main ummidavaar banane kaa vaada to kar diya lekin ain mauqe par khud tikat leki maidan main aa gayi
 There is also a campaign to reduce their growing political dominance throughout the region
 iske baad belahar seat par jahaan janata dal united ko 29722 vot kaa badhat loksabhaa chunaav main hasil thi or us samay trikoniya sangharsh tha lekin is baar party ke ummidavaar vartmaan saansad giridhari yadav ke bhai hai
 Janata Dal United believes that winning this seat is not very difficult
 jahaan tak simari bakhtierpur or nathanagar donon jagah loksabhaa chunaav main 41209 or 36462 vot se janata dal united ke pratyaashee aage the
 Similarly, after the Kishanganj seat and the triangular struggle, the Congress party had gained eight thousand votes in the Lok Sabha elections, due to which, despite this time, despite being in the fray of the BJP candidate, it is believed that the Congress party will not have any problem here
 needed
 or shaayad yahi kaaran he ki jahaan nitish kumaar ne ek-ek jansabhaon se zyada prachaar nahin kiya vahiin unke sahyogi bijepi ke netaa damaum se gathbandhan dharm nibhaane ke liye jansabha ke alaava road sho bhi kiya
 At the same time, Tejashwi Yadav's full attention was in the four assembly constituencies where his party's candidates were
 haalanki bahut aalochana ke baad samastipur loksabhaa seat par congress pratyaashee ke paksh main aakhirkaar unhone ek sabha kii lekin is baar ke chunaav parinaam ke baad agar congress party se kinaaraa karti he to koi aashcharya kii baat nahin he

 On May 26, two women Santosh and Afroz, including two women Yasmin and Reshma, were arrested by the police in Jaitpura area of varanasi in connection with heroin smuggling of Rs 1

 Meena and SSP Ajay Mishra rewarded the entire team along with these women officers
 kuch dinon pehle esaspi ajay mishra ko phone par ek esemes mila, jisamen jaitpura thane ke jamaluddinpura ilaake main drugs ke avaidh kaarobaar kii jaankaree di gai thi
 As soon as this information was received, the SSP formed a team to find out the illegal business, which was headed by Ambika Singh and Nati Imli Chowki Incharge Taramati Yadav
 team main esao jaitpura ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 On May 26, the police team raided a house in Jaitpura near Jamaluddinpura Sabzimandi and arrested two women Reshma and Yasmin from there
 ambika singh kahati hai, 'jab ham yasmin ke ghar main ghuse to usne bhaagane kii koshish kii
 Somehow we captured him
 yasmin ke ghar chhapemari main police ko dedh kilo heroin, 85,000 rupee nakad or nau mobile praapt hue
 'the price of heroin obtained in the raid has been estimated at Rs 125 crore in the international market
 is avaidh kaarobaar main yasmin ke saath uskaa pati abdul hasan urf tony pichley dedh dashak se laga hua he
 He is a history sheeter of Jaitpura police station
 uske khilaaf darj 16 maamalon main se 10 andipies act ke hai
 He has been imprisoned 10 times in the last 16 years, but gets released each time
 is baar bhi tony bhaagane main safal rahaa, lekin vishwaas se labarej taramati yadav kahati hai, 'jald hi ham tony ko bhi giraftaar kar lenge

 Explaining the reason for this, Professor Sohan Ram Yadav of bhu's Sociology Department says, "everyone is running after money because of the desire for happiness and prosperity
 chaahe use hasil karne kaa rasta galat hi kyon na ho
 There is a lot of money in the illegal trading of heroin
 isliye log kam mehnat main zyada paisa banane ke chakkar main galat raste par chal dete hai
 Such is the case of Yasmin and Abdul Hasan
 'abdul hasan pehle akele hi yah kaarobaar sambhalata tha
 But when a lot of money started coming, he also engaged his wife in this business
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, usne apane saale kii beti ko bhi apane is avaidh kaarobaar main shaamil kar liya
 Ambika Singh says, "when we entered Yasmin's house, we were completely shocked by the view inside
 sukh-suvidha kii koi bhi aisi cheez nahin thi, jo us ghar main nahin thi
 We cannot collect so much money and wealth even during our entire job, as much as Yasmin had
 'police kii giraft main aane ke baad yasmin ne heroin ke kaarobaar se jude kai raaj ugale hai
 Today, a large number of women are joining the heroin business, who are wearing burqas and transporting the goods easily to the customers
 pardaanasheen mahila hone ke kaaran koi un par shaq nahin karata
 Taramati Yadav, the leader of the campaign, says, "abdul Hasan, along with his wife and brother-in-law's daughter, has linked a lot of women to this illegal business
 'esaspi ajay mishra bhi maanate hai ki purvanchal ke saath hi varanasi main heroin kaa avaidh kaarobaar dhadlle se chal rahaa he
 "mere heroin is sent from Barabanki to the entire city," said Mishra
 maal ganga ke kinare ghaaton tak pahunchataa he
 They also have agents in Lallapur, Gauriganj and Alaipura
 bihar ke bhabhua or sasaram se bhi is giroh ke taar jude hue hai
 The gang people contact customers on mobile and transactions are done through middlemen
 'baharhaal, chaaron aropiyon ko jail bhej diya gaya he, lekin asli sargana tony ab bhi aaazaad gum rahaa he
 At present, the courage of Ambika and Taramati Yadav, who exposed this illicit trafficking in heroin, should be saluted, who carried out the mission with Dileri

 Sonia Gandhi has come home after being discharged from the hospital, but doctors have advised rest for the next few weeks
 isliye 15 agast ke din ke lihaaj se sawaal aayaa ki is baar party mukhyalay main jhanda koun fahraayega? jawaab aasaan tha- rahul gandhi
 Yet the question arose because it happened only once after becoming the party president in 1998, when in 2011 Sonia was abroad due to her illness and it was expected that Rahul would hoist the flag instead of Sonia
 rahul baqayada gandhi topi pahanakar congress mukhyalay aae bhi, lekin ain maukey par unhone koshadhyaksh or senior netaa motilal vora se jhanda fahraane kii guzarish kar di or vora ne rahul kii baat kaa sammaan karte hue jhanda fahraa diya
 Then two counts were taken out of it
 pehla ye ki rahul party mahasachiv hi hai, aise main takneekee taur par ohade ke lihaaj se party main or bhi mahasachiv hai, jisamen sabase senior motilal vora ko jimmedaari di gai
 Secondly, the operation of the Congress is in the hands of Sonia and her team, the team is limited to the responsibility given to the team only and Rahul is not going to take over immediately, this message also had to be given
 lekin is baar aadhikarik taur par party ne elaan kar diya ki 15 agast 2016 ko congress mukhyalay main jhanda congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi fahraayenge
 After all, now he is officially the vice president of the party i
e
 number two in the party
 vaise ab ye bhi sabko pataa he ki sirf taarikh kaa elaan baaki he varanaa andarkhaane rahul kii tajposhi tay kii ja chuki he
 In the political circles of hoisting of Rahul's flag, then Motilal Vora and now the meaning of hoisting the flag of Rahul is being removed
 sandesh sidhaa he ki aane vaale dinon main kabhi bhi congress kii kaman rahul ko saunpi jaani he
 Sonia Gandhi is increasingly transferring her responsibilities to Rahal
 udhar, sutron ke mutabik khud rahul bhi puraane or nae netaaon ke bich samanjasy ke saath party kaman sanbhaalane ko raji ho gaye hai
 Therefore, this time due to Sonia's illness, Rahul himself will be responsible for hoisting the flag in the Congress headquarters
 sonia kii beemaari ke chalate tale congress ke kai kaarykramaupi chunaav ke lihaaj se vaise to sonia kaa istemaal party simit hi karnaa chaahati thi, lekin ahm maukon or jagahon par wo sonia ke prachaar abhiyaan ko bhunaane kii taiyaari main thi
 After Kashi, Sonia's program was being held in Allahabad only in August, but now the program has been postponed
 saath hi bhavishya main hone vaale sonia gandhi ke kaaryakramon ko bhi hold par rakhaa gaya he
 Sonia will not participate in any public event until she is fully recuperated
 jaise 20 agast ko rajeev gandhi ko janmdin par sadbhaavna puraskaar ke kaarykram main bhi unke hissaa lene ke asaar kam hi bataae ja rahe hai
 Preparations for Rahul's program in place of Sonia In view of UP and Punjab elections, now Rahul Gandhi's programs are being prepared in place of Sonia Gandhi
 masalan, elahabaad main congress ke kaarykram ko thodaa aage badhaakar usamen rahul gandhi ke jane kaa kaarykram taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Rahul will make the decision by meeting the general secretaries, whether it is matters related to state organizations or decisions related to national politics, Rahul's final decision will be till Sonia recovers
 vaise abhi bhi party ke zyaadaatar ahm faisle rahul hi kar rahe the, jis par sonia muhar lagaati thim
 But in that case, some of the decisions were reviewed in the court of Sonia or it can be said that Sonia used to use veto power
 par ab rahul hi faisla karenge or vahi antim hoga
 Rahul will take over only after Sonia recovers, according to the party's instructions, the party had decided that after the end of the monsoon session of Parliament, Rahul would be crowned after seeing the right time
 lekin ab team rahul kaa hi kahana he ki sonia kii tabiyat thik hone par hi is babat koi faisla hoga
 With Sonia sick, Rahul will not be able to take charge of the party nor will Rahul himself agree to it
 priyanka kaa bhi badha rolavaise to priyanka party ke bheetar parade peeche lagaataar sakriy hai
 The people of his mother Sonia's Lok Sabha constituency Rae Bareli also hold weekly Janata Durbar
 ahm faislon main rahul hi nahin party ke varisht netaaon se bhi salaah-mashvira karti hai
 Especially in the affairs of Uttar Pradesh, they have a lot of interference
 haal hi party kii rajya kii nai team kii ghoshnaa se thik pehle pradesh ke prabharee mahasachiv ke ghar jaakar ek ghante kii mulaakaat kii tasviren bhi saamne ain thi
 Along with this, Priyanka also played an important role in the list of 80 finalized candidates for UP

 All this is happening, but two questions about Rahul Gandhi have been looking for answers for a long time
 pehla raajnneetik he ki wo congress adhyaksh kab banenge or doosraa vyaktigat ki wo shaadi kab karenge
 At the moment, everyone is waiting for Sonia to recover because the answer to both the questions is not going to come
 akbar ne birbal se ekbar kaha tha ki wo kagaz par bani ek lakeer ko bina kaate yaa mitaae chota karke dikhaae
 Birbal pulled a big line parallel to that line and thus Akbar's streak became shorter
 darbar ke rankon ke saamne pesh kii gai yah chunauti aaj khud baadshahon ke gale aa padi he or sthiti yah he ki lakeer ke samaanaantar badi lakeer khinch paane kii sari koshishen naakaafi sabit hoti nazar aa rahi hai
 The year 2019 is a very challenging year for the Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi
 yah chunauti 2013 main modi ke udai ke samay kii tulana main kahin adhik kathin nazar aa rahi he
 In 2013, Modi opened the chariot of publicity in the month of September, after becoming the face of bjp's prime ministerial post
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghiri ek 10 saal puraani sarkaar ke saamne sapanom or ummiido kii thri-di film dikhaane vaala ek jaadugar khadaa tha
 It had a bundle of dreams
 vaade the
 It was resolved to show what has not happened
 ek aaina tha jisamen dekhne par sab acha-acha dikhataa tha
 People call this mirror a model of Gujarat
 achche aks dikhaane vaale is jaadui aaine par logon ne yakeen kiya or uske bimbon ko sach maanakar usamen apni badali hui tasviir ko dekhakar mugdh hone lage
 The slogan was raised - good days are coming
 raajnneeti kii nadi ke ek kinare se vishwaas khoti janata ko duusare kinare kii sajaavat acchhee lag rahi thi
 Modi's propaganda was gradually becoming a wave and in front of that wave, all the clauses of politics were weakened
 isi prachaar or prabandhan se las modi lahar kii badaulat desh main azaadi ke baad se pehali baar ek bahumat vaali gair-congressi sarkaar kaa astitv dekhne ko mila or narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri bane
 By the first morning of 2019, more than four and a half years have passed
 log ab tak roti kii aas main thali bhar pani main chand kii parchaai dekh rahe hai
 The magic of magic is weakening
 gujarati aainaa kasautiyon par khara utarane ke bajaay gard or daagon se dhundhala hota ja rahaa he
 During this time, the situation in India has weakened in South Asia
 vaishvik str par bharat kii chhavi ko maanane or jataane kaa kaam duusare desh nahin, khud bharat karne main laga he
 The Prime Minister has a list of countless foreign visits, but the achievements are much less than that
 pakistan se bharat par aatanki hamale na to modi ke bhaashanon se kam ho paae hai or na hi unke chaay pine or gale milane se
 The question of inflation has become more macabre like the mouth of Sursa
 dijal ke daamon ne kisaanon kii qamar tod di he
 Electricity has reached the villages, but electricity prices are on the sky
 khaad or beej ke liye ro rahe kisaanon ke liye fasal beemaa ke vaade satahi or saste sabit hue hai
 Annadata's suicide continues rather than diminishes
 rojgaar srijan main sarkaar apane vaade se koson dur he
 Demonetisation has also completed the task and demonetisation has proved as deadly as the thunderbolt from the unorganized sector to the cottage entrepreneurs
 kalaadhan or bhrashtachar par nakel ke vaade chaaron khaane chitt nazar aa rahe hai
 The tenor of the achievements of the Modi government has become a rotten gagger
 yah bevajaah nahin he ki pehlepradhanmantrike khilaaf ek shabd na sunne ko raji janata ab aalochana ke kadave bol bolne lagi he
 In Rajasthan, Punjab, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Delhi, people have already rejected the Modi model
 congress mukt bharat kaa sapana apane antim lakshya tak pahunchane se pehle hi dharashayi ho gaya he
 Modi vs Modi, however, Modi's magic is completely crushed, it is not
 chehre par aadhaarit raajnneeti main modi ab bhi apni party or anya dalon ke chehron par baari pad rahe hai
 But democracy is not just a faceless car
 satta se lekar shakti tak vikendrikaran or bhagidaari hi loktantr kii sabase badi sundarataa or takat he or iske bina koi bhi jaadu feekaa hi padataa he
 Modi has to fight tough against the opposition and regional parties, but in 2019, the bigger challenge is to draw a big line parallel to 2014's Modi
 philhal aisa hota dikh nahin rahaa he
 Modi faces Modi himself
 philhal na 2014 jaisi lahar ke asaar hai or na andekhee sapanom kaa jaadu kaam aane vaala he
 On everything, on every promise, in 2019, Modi standing in front of the people will be compared to Modi in 2014
 patharilii sachchaaiyon vaale modi ke saamne achche dinon ke sapane vaala modi khadaa hoga
 People will repeatedly compare Modi of 2019 to Modi of 2014
 pichhali baar modi ke paas dikhaane ke liye sapane the
 This time Modi will have a five-year term
 or kaamkaaj bataane se nahin, maanane se sabit hota he
 If the public considers these five years more stylish than dreams, then only Modi will be able to see another wave, dream of another comeback
 yakeenan, modi ke liye 2019 sabase kathin saal sabit hone vaala he
 And in this competition, there is opposition in front of Modi, in 2014 Modi himself is also standing
 dekhnaa he modi badi lakeer khinch paane main kaamyaab honge yaa itihaas rach paane se pehle unki kalam suukh jaaegi

 Both of them used to meet ordinary businessmen from red light cars or expensive cars to senior officials of government banks

 " During the tri-series on SCG between India and Australia, there was a controversy over Sachin Tendulkar being run out
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne is star ballebaaj ke raste main khadey hone ke liye australian tej gendbaaj brett lee kii kadi aalochana kii
 The comments chaar saal pehle ‘mankigate cond’ ke liye mashhoor rahe esasiji par bhartiya pari ke saatven over kii vah aakhri gend thi
 It was over by Lee
 gautam gambhir ne ek ran ke liye aawaaj lagaai or tendulkar bhi daud pade lekin david warner ne unhen ran out kar diya
 Lee then came in his way
 tendulkar is tarah se out hone se kaaphi niraash the
 It was also evident that Lee was not happy with the way his road was blocked, but umpires Simon Tuffel (then standing at square leg) and Billy Boden ruled against the batsman after some discussion
 dhoni ne match ke samvaadadaata sammelan main lee ko aade haathon liya
 Dhoni said that there was no need for the Australian fast bowler to get in the way of Tendulkar
 unhone kaha, ‘main nahin maanata ki aap is baat ko sahi qaraar de sakate ho ki lee point kshetrarakshak kii taraf ja rahaa tha
 i do not believe that he then needed to go there and stand in front of Tendulkar
 iskaa matlab tha ki tendulkar ko lanbaa rasta tay karnaa padaa
 This is my assessment on that run out
 ’ It was the last ball of the seventh over of the Indian innings on SCG, which was famous for the 'monkeygate scandal' four years ago
 yah over lee ne kiya tha
 Gautam Gambhir sounded for a run and Tendulkar also ran but David Warner dismissed him
 lee tab unki raah main aa gaye the
 Tendulkar was very disappointed to be dismissed in this manner
 saath jaahir tha ki lee ne jis tarah se unka rasta roka tha usase vah khush nahin the lekin ampire simon tuffel (tab squaire leg par khadey) or billy boden ne kuch der charchaa karne ke baad ballebaaj ke khilaaf faisla sunaaya
 Dhoni hit Lee at the press conference for the match
 dhoni ne kaha ki australian tej gendbaaj ko tendulkar ke raste main aane kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 He said, 'I don't believe you can justify that Lee Point was going towards the fielders
 main nahin maanata ki use tab vahaan jane or tendulkar ke aage khadey hone kii jarurat thi
 This meant that Tendulkar had to go a long way
 us ran out par yah meraa akalan he

 You and us will be on target
 naksaliyon kii nai ranneeti shaharon par dhaava bolne kii he
 And these cities are not just Naxalite affected states
 is list main rashtriya rajdhani dilli kaa bhi naam he
 And here, a strategy is being made to attack selected targets or victims for violence
 ladaai kii bhashaa main ise target kiling kaha jaataa he
 That is, Naxalites will choose a hospital, station or school in the city and will attack there after preparation
 mautein hogi, bandhak banaae jaaenge auki sarkaar se sharten manavaai jaaengi
 It is not that the government is not aware of the net practice of this game of awe
 haalia intelligence report main yah saaf kiya gaya he ki naksali ab shahar kii taraf rukh kar sakate hai
 The objective is to increase the area of influence of their organization CPI Maoist
 naksali is ladai main indian mujahidin auki duusare aatankwaadi sanghathanon or algaavvaadi guton ke network kaa bhi istemaal karne kii taiyaari main hai
 The Intelligence report cited telephone conversations of Naxalite commanders operating in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha
 isamen baar-baar yah baat doharaai ja rahi he ki shahar main maujuud apane vaicharik saport group ke jariye ab ladaai vahiin ladi jaae
 One reason for this is also being told that the Naxalites are getting restless after seeing the influx of government schemes right in the rural areas
 saaf he ki ab ladaai jangal kii jameen tak simati nahin rahegi
 Now this matter will not be only for tribals and backward areas
 aise main ipel ke tamaashe kii khumaari main duube desh ko, uske hukmaranon ko sirf fori bahason or upayon tak simit nahin rahanaa hoga
 Why attack us after this report, the question comes in mind that what will be achieved by attacking Naxalite cities
 yahaan to unka saport base banane se rahaa
 The question here is more attention than support
 ye kuch vaisaa hi he ki kashmir main mujahidin aazaadee ke naam par dashakon se lard rahe hai
 But the issue of Kashmir comes in the headlines when these terrorists show an orgy of terror in a city like Mumbai
 usee tarj par maovadiyon ko ye samaj main aa gaya he ki jab tak anchhue nishane nahin saadhe jaaenge, unka prabhaav or unke vichaar kii bahes mukhyadhara main nahin aegi

 kabhi sarkari afasaron ko kidanap kiya, to kabhi doordarshan ke tower par hamalaa kiya
 But his presence, his targets and his intention came in the debate when the leaders who settled in the cities came on target
 darasal bastar main hue is hamale ne maovadiyon ke liye neon ke chamkile hording vaali publicity kaa kaam kiya he
 Naxalism gets attention at the international level and then there is strategic, tactical pressure on the government to resolve it, all this is being done keeping this in mind
 aaj ham aapako bataaenge ki ladaai ke is nae tareeke ke myne kya hai
 What are the governments doing to protect the citizens who have come under their target and where are they missing and after all, this fire started 44 years ago, which is named Naxalism, gets the raw material and air for itself
 is mudde par aapaki soch, aapaki raay bhi utani hi ahm he
 So tell me how big the danger is and who is responsible

 party ne e category main sirf 8 siton ko rakhaa he yani wo siten jahaan se jeet pakki he
 According to this survey, the seats which the party will definitely win include the Greater Kailash seat of Education Minister Kiran Walia

 uttar pradesh main police tabadatod encounter kar ricard banane main lagi he or CM yogi adityanath pradesh se badmaashon ke safaaye kaa daawa karte phir rahe hai
 But not even a single minute of this encounter campaign is visible to the rogue miscreants
 yahaan tak ki yogiraj main kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ke hometown main police hi ulte badmaashon se khaufjada he
 In the hometown of Rajnath Singh and Chandauli, a parliamentary constituency, miscreants shot dead a inspector last night
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki goli lagane se ghayal chaowkee incharge us samay gasht par niklaa hua tha
 Seriously injured SI Santosh Yadav has been admitted to BHU Trauma Center in Varanasi for treatment
 ghayal daaroga chandauli ke alinagar thana ke lauda police chaowkee par tainaat hai
 On the other hand, two of the three crooks who were attacking the outpost incharge were caught by the police with the help of the villagers, while the third rogue escaped
 darasal lauda police chaowkee ke incharge santosh yadav der raat motor cycle se gasht par nikle the
 He was also accompanied by two soldiers on a motorcycle
 gasht karte hue webasani gaanvaki taraf ja rahe the
 Then the garrison incharge was eyeing three youths sitting on a culvert near Barhuli village
 teenon yuvakon ke paas hi ek bike bhi khadi thi
 Outpost incharge Santosh Yadav stopped near the culvert and questioned the youth and asked for the papers of the car
 yuvak ne kagajaat nikaalane ke bahaane bike kii diggi kholi or palatakar SI santosh yadav par fire jhonk diya
 The bullet hit the outpost incharge and he fell there
 iske baad bike savaar badmaash gaanv kii taraf bhaag nikle
 The soldiers running along with the outpost in-charge informed the top officials of the case
 iske baad ghayal daroga ko varanasi ilaaj ke liye bheja gaya
 On the other hand, hearing the sound of firing, the villagers caught two of the running miscreants and caught them
 lekin teesraa badmaash bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 When the police reached the village, the villagers handed over the miscreants to the police
 centre or maharashtra kii rajya sarkaar main bijepi kii saathi shivasena lagaataar congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii tarifon main bayaan de rahi he
 On this, JDU, bjp's partner in Bihar government, says that Shiv Sena's statement is shocking
 shivasena-bijepi puraane dost hai, vah ek maatr party he jo bijepi ke vichaaron se mail khaati he
 He had said that Shiv Sena was born under the leadership of Balasaheb Thackeray to defeat the Congress
 jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki asal main jo vaktavy shivasena kaa he vah naaraazgi or gusse kaa he
 Does the Shiv Sena believe that the secularism of the Congress party is okay? Does the Shiv Sena accept the attitude of the Babri Masjid of the Congress? It is not so, but somewhere the Shiv Sena is angry with the BJP, so it is making such statements
 magar sabase puraani dost ke munh se nikali hui baaten BJP ko bhi tang karenge yah meraa maananaa he
 He said that the results of Gujarat, Karnataka and Himachal will also decide the direction
 hamane kabhi rahul gandhi ko pappu nahin kaha vah congress party ke ek aise parivaar kaa sadsy he jinhone aazaadee kii ladaai main hissaa liya
 Tyagi said that even if his maturity is not that much, it is not right to underestimate him and make fun of him
 tyaagi ne kaha ki unki party abhi bhi desh kii mukhya vipakshi party he congress party kii itani buree or karaari haar 1977 main bhi nahin hui
 But Modi ji is still ahead of Rahul Gandhi on the basis of experience and speech delivery
 aapako bataa den ki ajtak ke kaarykram mumbai manthan main shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki gujarat main rahul gandhi ko sunne ke liye baari bheed umad rahi he
 The public can make anyone Pappu, Rahul Gandhi is no longer Pappu
 rahul gandhi kya bolta he, kya karata he
 Whom do you get? usamen is desh kii janata ruchi lene lagi he
 This means that Rahul Gandhi can also give leadership to this country
 sanjay raut bole- hamaare samarthan se chal rahi he bijepi sarkarasanjay raut ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki hamane kabhi bhi do chehre kii raajnneeti nahin kii he
 He said that we do not do double faces, they do what some say in elections
 satta main aane ke baad kuch kehete hai, wo maukhata lagaakar raajnneeti karte hai
 Raut said that he is not speaking Devendra Fadnavis, he is speaking the Chief Minister
 ye unke kushi ke bol hai lekin unako ye baat dhyaan rakhni chahie ki unki sarkaar hamaare samarthan se chal rahi he
 We are not fond of staying in power
 hamane kabhi gathbandhan nahin todaa, bijepi ne gathbandhan todaa he
 He said that we are together in Maharashtra for the good of the people
 ham hindutv ke liye saath aaye the
 They broke the alliance before the assembly elections
 ab unako lagata he ki wo akele chunaav jeet sakate hai to wo gathbandhan par faisla le len
 We have always followed coalition religion
 film kaa naam :tumbaddiarector : raahi anil barve, aanad gandhistar cast : soham shah, ranjini chakravarti, deepak daamale, anitha daate, harish khannivadhi : 1 ghanta 53 minutesrtificate : aretimga : 3
 5 Starshoham Shah has appeared in different roles in films like Gulab Gang, Talwar and Simran
 2012 main tumbad main unka aagaaj hua, jo maharashtra ke 'tumbad' naamak gaanv kii kaalpanik kahani he
 The film was supported by Anand L
 Rai and is now set to release
 aaie jaanate hai aakhirkaar kisi bani he yah film
 
 
 Story: This film is divided into three chapters
 kahani 1918 main shuru hoti he jahaan maharashtra ke gaanv tumbad main vinayak raav (soham shah) apni maa or bhai ke saath rahata he
 But there is said to be a treasure hidden in the enclosure
 jisaki talash uski maa or use bhi hoti he
 But some such things happen, due to which his mother takes him to Pune
 15 saal ke baad vinayak phir se tumbad jaataa he or khajaane kii talash karne lagata he
 He gets married and has children too, but the greed for treasure keeps him from going to Tumbad from Pune again and again
 antatah ek aisi ghatana ghatati he, jo ki bahut bada sabak bhi he
 One has to watch the film to know this
 jaaniye aakhir film ko kyon dekhni chahiefilm kii kahani haalanki kaalpanik he, lekin jabardast he
 From the first frame to the end, it holds you to the seat
 mjedaar baat ye he ki aapako mobile phone par dhyaan dene kaa vakt nahin miltaa
 Because completely you have to pay attention to the screen so that nothing is missed
 film main manushya ke sabase bade moh or lobh ke bare main bahut badi baat kahi gai he
 Which Rahi Anil Barve has shown
 film kaa becoground score kamaal kaa he or filmakan kaa dhang bahut umdaa he
 In a way, the film enjoys 3D in 2D
 kaisaa he film main abhinavbhinay ke lihaaj se bahut hi umdaa kirdaar soham shah ne nibhaayaa he or unki mehnat screen par najar bhi aati he
 There are many difficult scenes, but they are played by every character
 lokation kamaal ke hai or ek tarah se vijual treet he yah film
 The title track of the film also follows along with the story
 kamazor kadiyaan:film kii kamjor kadi shaayad iskaa certification he, jo 'A ' he
 That is, only adult people will be able to watch this film
 iske saath hi film main koi bhi bada sitara nahin he
 Because of this, it will be a huge task to pull the audience to the theater
 zyaadaatar logon ko abhi bhi nahin pataa he ki yah film relies ho rahi he
 But those who get the news even once, they will definitely secure their seats
 box offis :film kaa bajet kaaphi kam he, lekin iske saath govinda kii friday, kaajol kii helicopter ila, mahesh bhatta ke production main jalebi relies ho rahi he
 It will be interesting to see how the film will be in the midst of the screens
 kya pataa kismat main koshish se hi hasil karnaa likhaa ho? is baar kii civil seva pariksha main 137 rank hasil karne vaale gauhar hasan par ye panktiyaan behad sateek baithti hai, jinhen chaar baar kii asafalataa diga nahin saki or aakhirkaar paanchavi koshish main ve kaamyaab rahe
 Gauhar Hassan had an early childhood in Motihari, North Bihar, after which he moved to Pusa near his elder Abbu where he started studying at the Campus Public School, but as soon as he reached the fifth class, the elder Abbu retired, who was there Rajendra Was posted in Agriculture University
 gauhar ekh baar phir motihaari aae or yahaan ke ikraa public skool se 70 fisadi number hasil kar metric kii pariksha paas kii
 After passing matriculation, he moved to Delhi where he did a diploma in computer science from Jamia Millia Islamia, then in 2008, he started working at CSE, an American multinational company, as well as his B- through the evening course of Jamia Millia Islamia
 Also acquired a Tech degree
 enditivi se apni baatcheet main gauhar bataate hai ki jab ve ejineering ke final year me the, tab hi inhone civil services dene kaa pakkaa man liya or usee samay se apni ranneeti banani shuru kar di
 The special thing is that Gauhar was in a good job at that time, but it was already settled in his mind that if he wants to work for the progress of the country and the development of society, then he has to be a civil servant
 gauhar ko shuru se hi pichde varg ke liye kaam karne kii ichha rahi he
 a unique thing with Gauhar was that he never resorted to coaching but instead he became a part of the Hamdard Study Group for preparation and joined the Vision IAS for mock tests
 opshanal subject ke taur par unhone urdu ko chunaa or apane 286 anko ke saath urdu main sarvaadhik number laakar unhone sabit kar diya ki unka chunaav ekadam sahi tha
 Gauhar says that he was not particularly interested in Urdu, but he has been a big fan of the famous poet Mirza Ghalib and perhaps this hobby of Shero Shayari brought him closer to Urdu and then Urdu got him this position
 gauhar kaa kahana he ki taiyaari ke dauraan unhone khud ke upar puraa bharosa rakhaa, ve bataate he ki is pariksha main documentation behad jaruri he, aap bahut sari chijen padhate hai unhen kisi ek jagah par likhane kii aadat daaliye
 For them to remember the facts, their repeated revision is very important
 civil services pariksha kii taiyaari karne waalon ke naam gauhar kaa sandesh he ki aap sabase pehle apane iraade ko pakkaa karen or agar aisa ho gaya to samajhie aapane aadhi jang jeet lee
 Someone has rightly said: "don't tell your spirits how big your problem is
 apni pareshaaniyon ko bataao ki tumhaara hausala kitna bada he
 " israel ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu ko apane prachaar main bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kii 'dosti' kaa bhi istemaal kar rahe hai

 Where did the students of the second car go
 ye pataa karne kii esechao ne agle do dinon tak koshish bhi nahin kii

 Four police constables were present on the crime scene but did not show the responsibility that should be shown in saving the students of the second car
 isliye unke khilaaf bhi karrwai hui
 ACP Ashwath Narayan Pise did not understand the seriousness of the case and did not properly inform his superiors
 isliye karrwai unpar kii gayi

 Sunil Grover come back the Kapil Sharma show sunil grover or kapil sharma ko lekar is vakt do hi sawaal charchaa main hai
 The first question is being talked about for several months when will Kapil and Sunil start working together? Second question, after the start of The Kapil Sharma Show is constantly being asked - will Sunil Grover return to Kapil's show and when will it be? Answer - Yes, Kapil and Sunil are seen together in The Kapil Sharma Show this year Can come
 isaki vajah upar ke donon sawaalon ke bich ek khaas 'pressure conection' he
 Yes, Salman Khan
 kuch samay se iske sanket bhi milte dikh rahe hai
 Actually, Kapil's show has become popular as soon as it comes on TV
 is baar kapil ke peeche salmaan hai or sho produs kar rahe hai
 He also reached the show with his father and brothers as the other celebrity guests
 tiarapy reating main mahaj kuch episod ke baad hi sho top 2 list main shaamil ho chukaa he
 Salman is the answer to why Sunil Grover can come together
 kapil ke sho ko tivi par jamaane ke liye is baar salmaan ne qamar kas lee he
 If reports are to be believed, Salman has settled between Sunil and Kapil
 kamedi ke donon baadshahon ke bich ab sabakuch thik thaak he
 Recently, in a special conversation with Ajatak, Sunil Grover also reiterated that both of them have moved forward by dissolving old things
 salmaan is vakt donon sitaron ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 While Salman has made his debut as a TV producer with Kapil's show, he is working with Sunil Grover in India
 kapil ke sho main sunil ke aane kaa ek bada sanket "kanpur vaale khuranaj" kaa band hona bhi he
 According to Sunil, he had signed the show only for a few episodes of Khuranaz
 yani tivi par sunil kaa koi doosraa sho nahin he
 Even in the future, there is no scope for any such show
 mana ja rahaa he ki bharat kii shooting khatm kar sunil, kapil ke saath sho main lautenge
 Fans also have the same demand

 a post shared bysunil Grover (@whosunilgrover) onjan 31, 2017 at 7:43 am PST What will Sunil do after shooting for India? Sunil Grover has announced on social media that he is busy shooting Salman's film India for 40 days Huh
 lekin iske baad wo kis project main kaam karenge ye sawaal bana he
 It was earlier believed that Sunil would return to this place after taking a break from Khuranaz show in Kanpur
 lekin sho ke band hone kaa elaan khud kamedian ne hi kiya he
 In such a situation, there are enough excuses and opportunities to believe that he is coming with Kapil
 kapil kaa sho top par he
 Salman, the show's producer, would like it to remain on top
 pichley dinon ajtak se baatcheet main sunil ne bhi sanket diya ki bhavishya main agar mauka mila to ve kapil ke saath jarur kaam karenge
 That is, after India, this "chance" can be the Kapil Sharma show for Sunil
 bhala sunil, salmaan bhaijan ko naa thode kahenge
 So it can be assumed that Sunil may return in Kapil's show
 aisa hua to kamedi pasand karne waalon ke liye ye kisi tohfe se kam nahin he

 Asthma occurs due to inflammation in the air ducts of the lungs, with frequent wheezing and breathlessness
 asthma kaa sabase pramukh kaaran parivaar main asthma kaa itihaas hona bhi he
 However, air pollution, household allergies such as bedbugs, stuffed furniture, tobacco smoke and chemical substances are among the major factors in asthma
 vibhinn vajahon se hone vaale asthma ke bhi kai prakaar hote hai jaise edlt onsett asthma, allergic ocupational asthma, vyaayaam se hone vaala asthma or gambhir (sivir) asthma ityadi
 Chronic asthma is usually treated with continuous medications
 lekin gambhir lakshanon ko niyantrit karne ke liye adhik unnat upachaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 About 8-10 percent of the total population of people with asthma has severe asthma
 bataa den, duniya ke 20 sarvaadhik pradooshit shaharon main se 13 bharat main hai
 Air pollution in India has led to health crisis
 is maamle main bharat main asthma kii kul jansankhya ke lagbhag 15 se 20 pratishat logon yani takreeban 3 karod logon par asar daal rahaa he
 Increasing pollution levels may increase this number to hundreds of millions in the coming years
 noida sthit metro respiretary centre ke varisht salaahkaar or chairman dow
 Deepak Talwar says, "people who continue to have wheezing or cough for 1-2 months despite taking inhalers, they fall into the category of severe asthma
 vahiin, jo marij asthma ko niyantrit karne ke liye varsh main do baar se adhik oral steroid lete hai, ve bhi asthma kii gambhir shrenee main aate hai or antarnihit sujan ko niyantrit karne ke liye lambey samay tak roj dawaai kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 "dr
 talwaar ke mutabik, acchhee khabar yah he ki swasthya sevaaon main nawacharon ne un rogiyon ke liye gambhir asthma ke lakshanon kaa upachaar karnaa aasaan bana diya he, jo lambey samay se dawaaion par bharosa karte aae hai
 a pioneering invention in this field, bronchial thermoplasty has emerged as one of the most reliable options for people suffering from severe asthma who suffer from asthma symptoms despite maximum medical treatment
 unhone aage kaha ki saamaanya shwaas ke saath fefdon ke vayumarg puri tarah se khule hote hai
 People with severe asthma have extremely smooth airway muscles that orbit their airways
 vayumarg kii sujan ke saath yah atirikt mansapeshi vayumarg kii deevaaron ko motaa banane ke liye jud jaati hai
 During an asthma attack, the smooth muscle of the airway shrinks, causing difficulty in breathing
 dow
 Talwar states that during bronchial thermoplasty, a small flexible tube is implanted into the airway through a standard flexible bronchoscope placed through the mouth or nose
 upachaar vayumarg kii deevaaron ko niyantrit tapiya urja pradaan kar ke vayumarg main smood masal maas ko kam karata he
 This is done in three bronchoscopies
 unhone kaha ki yah therapy lagbhag 80 pratishat tak mansapeshiyon ko saamaanya aakaar main laane main sahaayak hoti he
 The reduction in muscle size has an inherent effect on patients who are drug dependent, as it becomes more effective and opens the airways slightly
 yah asthma ke daure ke dauraan diwaar kii sankuchan or sankeern hone kii kshamta ko kam karata he
 Over the past several years, bronchial thermoplasty has helped severe asthmatic patients to better treat their condition, significantly improving their quality of life

 Sources said that the agency analyzed the documents related to the movement of files to the ministry and questioned the officials handling the files before going missing
 agency ko yah bhi andeh he ki ho saktaa he ki kuch filon ko kuch aaropee corporate samoohon ke ishaare par jaanboojhkar gaayab kiya gaya ho
 The sources refused to disclose the identity of the officials concerned as they have not been considered accused and the agency has not formally registered a case and this can be done only after some disturbances were found during the initial investigation
