 In 2014, the BJP promised that it would give value by adding fifty percent of the profits to the cost when it came to power
 sarkaar ne sapreme court main kaha ki nahin de sakate
 On May 28, BJP President Amit Shah says two things in this context
 pehla ki laagat main zamin kii laagat jodakar koi bhi sarkaar swaminathan formule ko lagu nahin kar sakati he
 Then they calculate their own
 laagat mulya main zamin kii laagat gata dete hai or kehete hai ki sarkaar ne laagat se 43 fisadi zyaada nunatam samarthan mulya diya he
 They are not saying about all the crops or it is not clear about any one crop, but the matter of 43 percent higher price was published by the media as the headline
 mangalvaar ko prime time main hi devinder sharma ne kaha ki agar aisa hua hota to sarkaar har vigyaapan or press conference main daawa kar rahi hoti
 We searched a lot in this two-page advertisement, which was claimed by Amit Shah on 28 May
 aap yakeen nahin karenge ki do panne ke vigyaapan main nunatam samarthan mulya ke bare main koi zikr hi nahin he

 Amit Shah says that by adding the cost of land, no government can pay fifty percent of the cost
 nunatam samarthan mulya dene se saare kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya nahin mil jaataa he
 In the same month, among the agricultural scientists in Delhi, India's Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said that the government tried its best to buy pulses at the minimum support price
 iske baad bhi 60 fisadi kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya se kam par daalen bechni padin
 Even after doing its best, the government was able to give minimum support price to 40 percent farmers

 The Allahabad High Court has approved a public interest litigation against Mayawati's brother Anand Kumar
 is janhit yachika main mayawati ke bhai anand singh ke 750 karod rupee kii sampatti kii sibiai or idi se jaanch karaane kii maang kii gai he jise court ne manjuur kar liya he
 In this regard, the High Court has sought a response from the CBI and ED department in five weeks

 BJP and its allies won 73 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats
 ab vidhansabha chunaav main bhi purvanchal kii adhikansh siten bijepi ke khate main gai hai
 In such a situation, it has been speculated for a long time that CM will be from Purvanchal
 haalanki, pehle manoj sinha kaa naam aage chal rahaa tha lekin aakhri res main yogi udaan bharte dikhe

 anya daavedaaron kaa koi jamini aadhaar nahinupi siem kii res main shaamil anya daavedaaron kaa koi jamini aadhaar nahin hona bhi yogi ke paksh main gaya
 Yogi Adityanath has influence in more than 60 assembly seats in Purvanchal and many Lok Sabha constituencies
 jabaki keshav prasad maury ke khilaaf aaropon or manoj sinha kii kshetra main jamini pakad nahin hona unke khilaaf gaya

 jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne aaj kaha ki mangalvaar ko id-ul-ajaha par karpu lagaana ‘bahut durbhagyapurna’ nirnay tha lekin algaavvaadiyon ke sanyukt raashtra karyaalay tak ek march nikaalane ke aahvaan ke kaaran logon kii janmaal kii suraksha ke liye aisa ‘majabuuran’ karnaa padaa
 Senior minister and government spokesman Naeem Akhtar said the move was taken to avoid a recurrence of one such incident in 2010 when protesters took part in a march led by Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq after the Eid prayers The 'subversive action' took place
 is vivaadaaspad nirnay ko lene kii majaburi ke bare main unhone bataaya ki ‘‘yah bahut durbhagyapurna tha ki hamen karfu lagaana padaa
 But this decision was taken under a special circumstance, in which some people called for a march to the United Nations Office
 unhone bataaya, hamen karfu lagane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Taking such a step is not in any way good for the image of any government but it is the responsibility of the government to ensure law and order
 algaavvaadi hijbul mujahidin ke aatankwaadi burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad 9 july se andolan kii aguwai kar rahe hai
 He called for a march to the United Nations Office on the occasion of eid-ul-azha and the government was committed to thwart it
 shiksha mantralay kaa kaamkaaj dekh rahe akhtar ne bataaya ki, yah sanyukt raashtra karyaalay tak march nikaalane ke aahvaan kii pratikriya main kiya gaya ek krity tha
 This could have been avoided

 Despite being a woman, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti went to the Hazratbal shrine on that day to offer Namaz
 unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin ab, vahaan ek alag sthiti he
 We feel that we have saved people's lives by imposing curfew, which is our primary responsibility as a government

 On the attitude of the separatists, Akhtar said that his movement is defaming the name of common Kashmiris and is especially hurting the state economically and academically
 tippaniyan Akhtar said that this performance would have a 'long-term impact' on the economy, trade and the entire Kashmir Valley
 unhone kaha, hamaara ek shaikshanik satr pehle hi samaapt ho gaya he
 Everything we did was being ruined
 unhone kaha ki andolan kii aguwai kar rahe netaaon ko apni ranneeti, apane naaron or apane raajnneetik rodmap par dobaaraa vichaar karnaa chahie
 They should peep into their gireban and be ready to negotiate without any preconditions
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) varisht mantri or sarkaar ke pravaktaa naeem akhtar ne kaha ki yah kadam 2010 main ghati aisi hi ek ghatana kii punrariti hone se bachane ke liye uthaaya gaya jab pradarshnakariyon ne id kii namaaj ke baad hurriyat netaa mirwij umr farrukh ke netritv main ek march main hissaa lete hue ‘vidhvansak karrwai’ kii thi
 On the compulsion to take this controversial decision, he said, "it was very unfortunate that we had to impose curfew
" lekin yah nirnay ek vishesh paristhiti main liya gaya, jisamen kuch logon ne sanyukt raashtra karyaalay tak ek march nikaalane kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 He said, we were forced to impose curfew
 is tarah kaa ek kadam uthaanaa kisi bhi sarkaar kii chhavi ke liye kisi bhi tarah se thik nahin he lekin kanoon or vyavastha sunishchit karnaa sarkaar kii jimmedaari he
 The separatist Hizbul Mujahideen militants have been spearheading the agitation since July 9 after the killing of Burhan Wani
 unhone id-ul-ajaha ke maukey par sanyukt raashtra karyaalay tak ek march nikaalane kaa aahvaan kiya tha or sarkaar ise vifal karne ke liye patibaddh thi
 Akhtar, who is overseeing the work of the Ministry of Education, said that it was an act done in response to the call to march to the United Nations Office
 ise taala ja saktaa tha
 He said that only two months ago ird-ul-fitr (on 7 July) was celebrated brilliantly with peace in Kashmir
 ek mahila hone ke baavjood mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti us din namaaj padhane ke liye hazratbal dargah gai thim
 He said, "but now, there is a different situation
" hamen lagata he ki hamane karfu lagaakar logon kii jindagiyon ko bachaa liya he, jo sarkaar ke naate hamaari praathmik jimmedaari he
 "we have an example of 2010 when thousands of people took part in a march led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and after the Eid prayers, the demonstrators carried out a vandalism incident," Akhtar said
 algaavaadiyon ke rukh par akhtar ne kaha ki unka andolan aam kashmiriyon ke naam ko badnaam kar rahaa he or visheshkar aarthik or academik rup se rajya ko aghat pahunchaa rahaa he
 The comments akhtar ne kaha ki is pradarshan kaa arthvyavastha ,vyapaar or puri kashmir ghati par ‘dirghakaalik prabhaav’ padegaa
 He said, one of our academic sessions has already ended
 hamane jo kuch bhi acha kiya tha use barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the leaders leading the movement should reconsider their strategy, their slogans and their political roadmap

 ) JDU National General Secretary and MP RCP Singh has increased the heat of Bihar's politics with his statement
 aaaraseepi singh ne aaj saaf taur par kaha kibijepiorgediuke bich loksabhaa siton kaa bantwaaraa ho chukaa he
 It will be announced soon by the big leaders of the party
 haalanki, kal tak bijepi sahit gathbandhan ke tamaam sahyogiyon ne seat bantwaare ko lekar yah kaha tha ki seat bantwaare par abhi antim faisla nahin hua he
 After this, on Wednesday, RCP Singh has abolished the seat-sharing suspense, putting an end to all the speculations
 seat bantwaare ko lekar pichley 2 dinon se raajnneetik galiyaaron main kai tarah kii baaten tair rahi thim
 Many equations were coming up regarding seat sharing
 halaki, siton kii sankhya ko lekar aaaraseepi ne kuch nahin kaha lekin party sutara bataate hai ki sankhya chaahe jo ho bijepi or jediu baraabar siton par chunaav ladenge
 The reason behind this is that JDU, which always plays the role of elder brother in Bihar, does not want to reduce its stature in front of BJP at any cost
 halaki, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jediu kaa kad kaaphi chota ho gaya tha or bijepi uske saamne pahaad jaisi badi ho gai
 But, after coming to the NDA again, jdu's attempt is that the matter should be at least equal so that the honor remains
 is barabari ke chakkar main bijepi ke saath-saath lok janashakti party or rashtriya loksamata party ko apni siton ko kam karnaa hoga

 The confrontation between the judiciary and the executive is not new
 lekin supreme court jab rajnatik varg main dakhal dene lagata he, jaanch agenciyon par najar rakhane lagata he, prashasnic visangatiyon ko ujagar karne lagata he or shashan ke muddon ko uthaane lagata he tab karypalika ke liye khatra ban jaataa he

 To expedite the investigation, the court decided to initiate another new trend by giving the task of investigation to a special court of daily trial under a special public prosecutor of the court's choice (who is usually appointed by the government)
 is par vaahnavati ne aapatti uthaai
 But the bench did not agree
 'vyavastha ko sudhaaro'-yahi jaise supreme court kaa mantra ho gaya he
 On the very first day, the Chief Justice abolished the tradition under which cases were mentioned every morning in the morning (previously, unlisted cases, without mentioning and without turn, exercised discretionary right to hear cases

 Those who still do not understand how to send a kiss can see this video of Burberry, in which all the steps of sending a kiss are explained: kya 26 sitambar se lekar 2 oktober tak bharat ke sabhi bank band rahenge? kuch soshal media yujar daawa kar rahe hai ki bainkon main 7 din kii lambii chuttee hone ja rahi he, jiske kaaran atm main paise nahin rahenge
 People are also being asked in these posts to withdraw cash in advance
 fasebuk yujar “ayek Apan” ne daawa kiya he ki “26 or 27 sitambar ko bainkon main hadtaal kii ghoshnaa hui he

 There will be no work in banks for seven days
 27 sitambar ke baad zyaadaatar atm khaali ho jaaenge
 Therefore, withdraw money from the ATM in advance because you cannot make digital payments anywhere other than the supermarket and the mall for vegetables and fish, etc

 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the holiday list given in this post is not correct
 bainkon main do din kii hadtaal jarur bulaai gai, lekin 30 sitambar ko bainkon main chuttee nahin he
 AFWA conducted a Google search on the strike in the banks, it was found that employee unions of four national banks had called for the strike
 ye hai- ol india bank officers kanfederation, ol india bank officers association, indian neshnal bank officers congress or neshnal orgenigeshan of bank officers
 The strike was called to protest the merger of banks
 haalanki, sarkaar kii taraf se aashwaasan milane ke baad yah hadtaal waapas le lee gai

 in donon din jarur bank band rahenge
 But there is no holiday on 30 September and 1 October
 bharat ke sabase bade rashtriya bank 'state bank of india' (SBI) ke pravaktaa ne kaha, “SBI kii sabhi shakhaaen is puure hafte saamaanya taur par kaam karti rahengi
 Normal work will be done next week too, there is not going to be any inconvenience to the customers
 atm, digital tranjection or online banking jaisi sabhi suvidhaayen 24 ghante uplabdh rahengi
 "apart from this, the Reserve Bank of India has also not included in its holiday list on September 30 and October 1
 yahaan tak ki jis din ardhvarshik bandi hoti he, us din bhi banking tranjection or anya kaary saamaanya dhang se chalata rahata he
 Only on 2 October will be a national holiday on Gandhi Jayanti
 is tarah yah spasht he ki desh bhar ke bainkon main 26 sitambar se lekar 2 oktober tak saat din kii chhuttiyaan nahin hai

 ’’ After 20 thousand liters of water by the Arvind Kejriwal government, now two hundred units of electricity have also been freed
 vahiin metro main bhi mahilaon ko muft safar kii suvidha dene kii yojana par kaam chal rahaa he
 In such a situation, the announcements of free travel in electricity, water and metro will add further burden on the treasury of Delhi Government
 vajah ki sarkaar ko muft kii ghoshnaaon se hue nuksaan kii bharpai sabsidi dekar puri kerani padegi
 The total budget size of Delhi government is up to about 60 thousand crores
 muft bijli par ab sarkaar ko dhai hajaar karod rupee salanaa kii sabsidi deni padegi
 About four and a half crore rupees subsidy is already being given on water
 muft metro safar kii bhi suvidha shuru hui to 1500 karod se 2000 karod rupee kii or sabsidi badhegi
 Till now, the Delhi government used to give a rebate of up to 50 percent in the four hundred units electricity bill
 tab 1600-1700 karod rupee kii sabsidi sarkaar ko bijli companiyon ko deni padati thi
 But now the government has made electricity consumption up to two hundred units free

 dilli main kul 47 lakh gharelu bijli upabhokta hai
 Officials of the electricity department say that the Kejriwal government had to bear the burden of Rs 1600-1700 crore every year due to the decision to give 50 percent rebate to 400 units
 bataa den ki farvari, 2015 main dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar banane ke baad mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne chaar sau unit tak bijli bill main 50 pratishat chhot dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 At the same time, the bill of water up to 20 thousand liters was also waived
 aankadon ko dekhen to 2015-16 main sarkaar ne pani or bijli sabsidi ke liye 1,690 karod jari kiye the
 About 450 crore annual expenditure is incurred only on water subsidy

 There was a dancer on the stage and she was doing a dance for the entertainment of the public, looting Congress notes on these songs

 Neeraj has decided to contest from here and wanted to show the strength of drawing his crowd to the leaders who came to the conference to ensure the ticket

 The dancer continued to show her performance and the local people forgot about their sorrows, pain and inflation and development and got entangled in this cheap entertainment

 Crude oil prices have fallen by more than 17 percent in the last one and a half months
 24 april ko antarrashtriya bazaar main brent crude kaa bhav 75 dollar ke kareeb tha or somvaar ke satr main bhav 63 dollar ke kareeb hai
 The reason for this drop in crude oil prices is due to fears of expert global slowdown and demand for crude oil
 kedia camodities ke pramukh ajay kedia kehete hai, ‘’kachche tel kii keemton main giravat kaa kaaran iemef or world bank jaisi sansthaaon kii ore se aarthik vikaas dar ke anumaan ko ghataana he
 This reinforces the possibility of weak demand
 ”in addition, the continuously increasing inventory of crude is also a reason for the fall in crude oil prices
 kachche tel kii keemton main beete chaar satron main nichle str se kuch vaapasi dekhne ko mili he
 The reason for this withdrawal is the effect of the agreement of OPEC and non-opec countries on reducing crude oil production
 lekin kedia maanate hai yah vaapasi lambey samay tak tikne vaali nahin he
 Traders will work on the strategy of selling at the upper level, so there is a possibility of a fall after every small rise

 For the general public, the direct benefit is seen as a decline in the prices of petrol and diesel
 iske alaava kachche tel ke saste rahane par mahangaai niyantran main rahati he
 Also, the reduction in the import bill also supports the fiscal situation

 " Indian wrestling was mired in controversy in 2016 due to a court battle after a wrestler was caught in dope, but Sakshi Malik finally saved her from embarrassment by winning the Bronze medal at the Rio Olympics
 saal main adhiktar samay kushti galat kaarnon se sukhiryon main rahi
 Preparations ahead of the Olympics were turbulent as two-time Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar came to know two months before the Rio Games that he had not been selected in the squad
 iske baad kai aisi ghatnaayen hui jisase khel ko badanaami jhelni padi lekin sakshi ne brazili shahar main bharat ke liye pehla medal jitkar nayaa itihaas rach diya
 She became the first Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal
 sakshi ne mahilaon ke 58 kigra freestil ke bronj medal ke liye khele gaye plaof mukaable main 0-5 se pichhadane ke baad kirgistan kii isulu tinibekova ko 8-5 se haraaya
 Due to this medal, the poor performance of the eight-member wrestling team went unnoticed
 bhartiya team main pehali baar teen mahila pahalwaan shaamil thim, lekin keval sakshi hi padak jeetne main safal raheen
 Bronze medalist Yogeshwar Dutt of the London Olympics had high hopes but was eliminated in the qualifying round
 sakshi ke chamatkaarik pradarshan se kuch raahat mili kyonki narsingh yadav ke baahar hone se bharat kaaphi niraashaa main tha
 Narasimha was banned for four years for failing a dope test as the Sports Arbitration (CAS) changed the clean chit decision given to this wrestler by the National anti-doping Agency (NADA)
 vishwa doping rodhi agency (wada) ne narsingh ke mukaable se teen din pehle nadaa ke faisle ko cas main chunauti di thi
 The 27-year-old wrestler's name was listed on the official Olympic program list to be weighed, but Cass's decision derailed all his expectations
 tippaniyan Even what happened before the Olympics was not good for Narasimha and the Indian team
 visheshkar narsingh ke liye pareshaaniyaan khatm nahin huin
 It started with a claim to the Olympic seat in 74kg and finally the case went to court
 narsingh adaalat main jeet gaye lekin iske baad unka pareekshan pratibandhit padaarth ke seven ke liye positive paaya gaya
 Earlier in September 2015, Narasimha won the Olympic medal for India by winning the Bronze medal at the World Championships in Las Vegas
 narsingh ko haalanki pataa tha ki unka olympic main janaa pakkaa nahin he kyonki susheel bhi is bhaar varg main khelte hai

 unke is medal ke kaaran aath sadasyeey kushti dal ke lachar pradarshan par bhi kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya
 The Indian team included three women wrestlers for the first time, but only Sakshi managed to win a medal

 The World anti-doping Agency (WADA) had challenged Nada's decision in CAS three days before Narsingh's match
 is 27 varshiya pahalwaan kaa naam vajan karaane ke liye olympic kaarykram kii aadhikarik suchi main darj tha lekin cas ke faisle ne unki sari ummiido par pani pher diya
 The comments yahaan tak ki olympic se pehle jo kuch hua vah narsingh or bhartiya team ke liye acha nahin rahaa

 Although guides may not be found in Indian universities, guidelines will be available
 sabake paas guidelins hai magar kisi ke paas line length nahin he
 Guidelines in Hindi are called guidelines
 disharnidesh jari to kiye jate hai magar ve kisi disha main nazar nahin aate hai
 The UGC formed a committee to make a guideline on how many students should have teachers
 jeeke tarin kii adhyakshata main cameti bani
 On 16 March 2011, the press release of the Press Information Bureau stated that the Taran Committee suggested that 25 students of Signs in undergraduate colleges will have one teacher
 soshal scince ke 30 chaatro par ek shikshak hoga
 PG Signs will have one teacher on 10 students
 piji soshal scince main 15 chaatro par ek shikshak hoga
 Not only this, the UGC has created guidelines for Institutions of Eminence
 yah vahi he jiskaa zikr pradhanmantri ne patna uniwarsity ke 100 saal hone par kiya tha ki 10 privet or 10 public uniwarsity ko vishwa stareey banaaya jayega taaki duniya kii 200 uniwarsity main sthaan praapt ho sake
 i will also talk about this ranking separately
 ek nae kism kaa jhunjhuna he
 However, in the guideline made by the UGC for Institutions of Eminence, it is clearly written that while issuing the notification to declare an institution as a prestigious institution, there should be only 20 students on 1 teacher and one teacher on 10 students in five years
 agar ye baat he tab to phir har college main yah anupaat hona chahie taaki chaatro ko behatar shiksha mil sake
 Do students coming to university or college have this information, is it written on their form or brochure which they buy by paying 1000 to 1500 rupees, should it not be written that you are welcome here, UGC According to this, there should be one teacher for every student, but we will give one teacher for 300 to 400 students
 kya yahi kaaran he ki class main samaj nahin aane par chaatr rekha guide, jasapaal guide or champion guide kii sharan main jaakar paas hone kii gati praapt karte hai

 You have seen the ratio of student to teacher, there is no need to beat the head, in terms of this number, the number of sanctioned posts of teachers in every college will also multiply and the lottery will open for the qualified candidates who pass the NET exam

 isamen shikshakon kii kul sankhya 132 honi chahie jabaki maatr 65 hai

 kya nack kii grading kaa koi matlab he, jain college aara kii kuch imaaraton ko nack kii team ke chakkar main teen teen baar rangana potna pad gaya
 After all, where there should be 132 teachers, 65 are there, then what is any grading being given to it, to keep the youth of Ara from pretending that it has a b grade, keep taking admission here and then instead of class corridor Keep preparing for railway guard by hitting Mundi
 bharat sarkaar ko nack system kii hi jaanch kerani chahie ki yah sab ho kya rahaa he
 Naik's team charges college for going everywhere and giving grades
 jain college aara main saadhe gyaarah hazaar bachche padhate hai
 According to this number, the number of sanctioned posts for teachers here should be between 350 and 400 but the number of sanctioned posts is only 132
 is 132 main se 65 shikshak hi hai
 The old principal here ruined the college a lot, but the newcomers who are coming here are trying a lot which has no result

 You know how big a problem it is to give a problem in writing in India

 The toilet in the college is in such a bad condition that the teachers had to go home, in fact you must have understood that they too would have resorted to any such eastern gate
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki nae principal ke aane ke pehle to aap college ke shauchalay kaa istemaal bhi nahin kar sakate hai, unhone saaf safai par dhyaan diya he
 Principal sir has understood that the recruitment of teachers is not just about him, so he has recourse on the biometric system so that those who do not come can start coming
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation

 2500 chaatro ko itihaas padhaane ke liye is college main puure college main ek hi sthaayee shikshak he

 There are three temporary teachers who do not receive salary

 The VC here said in response to every problem that i am not permanent, the students went on a 14-day strike in September 2015 to demand a permanent VC
 e ke pujari permanent visi banakar aa gaye magar samasyaayein bhi sthai ho gayi
 So in September 2016, the students again protested
 visi ne sari maangen maanane kaa vaada kar diya magar chaatr sangh ke chunaav se mukar gaye
 When the students were adamant, 50 to 60 agitating students were resticated for 15 days
 march 2017 main mess ko lekar jab chaatro ne pradarshan kiya to chaar chaatro ko ek satr ke liye hi nikaal diya
 Students went to High Court, High Court said go to college

 This student is not allowed inside the college
 kya ye zyaadati nahin he ki ek chaatr ko college main na aane diya jaae, pradarshan karne kii itani badi sazaa di jaae, phir jin collejon main teacher nahin hai, padhai nahin hoti he unki sazaa chaatr kise den

 The name of freedom fighter and socialist leader Acharya Narendra Dev is still taken in UP politics but the condition of agricultural university named after him is also bad
 tippaniyan In 1975, the buildings of Acharya Narendra Dev Agriculture University looked fine from outside
 shaayad hamaare dekhne kaa yahi nazariyaa ho gaya he ki building or campus thik he to college yaa uniwarsity thik hogi
 But when our colleague Pramod Shrivastava went here, it came to know that there should have been 42 head of the department but there are only 32
 professor or assistant professor kii kami he
 The condition of the lab is very poor
 is lab ko dekh kar nahin lagegaa ki kisi uniwarsity kaa he
 The students said that the toilet in their hostel is very dirty

 There is a shortage of resources or else it was desired that agriculture would report deeply on universities
 inaki haalat bhi bahut acchhee nahin he
 Our colleague Arshadeep has told from Ludhiana that 40 percent teaching and non-teaching positions are vacant in Punjab Agricultural University

 Just below this college, the coal mafia has taken out coal by making a tunnel, due to which the foundation of the college has been weakened

 College can collapse at any time

 When the students come here, they run away with attendance, fearing that the building may collapse
 hamaari story kaa yahi hua he ki choti moti raajnneeti hone lagi he
 On 6 November, a Panchayat of students of this college held in Lohria Kali temple, in which Congress district president Deepika Pandey Singh arrived
 vichaar hua ki is is college ko kii imaarat or zamin ke liye maang kii jaaegi
 Parents also came to the student panchayat
 principal kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi sawaal uthe
 Here the students also told us what we did not know
 unhone kaha ki scolership lene se pehle rishwat deni padati he
 Deepika has also given a letter to the commissioner of Godda
 netaaon ko aise college ke bare main pehle se pataa hona chahie
 Not that he got ready to perform when he came on TV
 bijepi saasand nishikant dube ne isiel ke adhikariyon se baat kii he or is mudde ko uthaaya he
 Not only this, the UGC has created guidelines for Institutions of Eminence
 yah vahi he jiskaa zikr pradhanmantri ne patna uniwarsity ke 100 saal hone par kiya tha ki 10 privet or 10 public uniwarsity ko vishwa stareey banaaya jayega taaki duniya kii 200 uniwarsity main sthaan praapt ho sake
 i will also talk about this ranking separately
 ek nae kism kaa jhunjhuna he
 However, in the guideline made by the UGC for Institutions of Eminence, it is clearly written that while issuing the notification to declare an institution as a prestigious institution, there should be only 20 students on 1 teacher and one teacher on 10 students in five years
 agar ye baat he tab to phir har college main yah anupaat hona chahie taaki chaatro ko behatar shiksha mil sake
 Do students coming to university or college have this information, is it written on their form or brochure which they buy by paying 1000 to 1500 rupees, should it not be written that you are welcome here, UGC According to this, there should be one teacher for every student, but we will give one teacher for 300 to 400 students
 kya yahi kaaran he ki class main samaj nahin aane par chaatr rekha guide, jasapaal guide or champion guide kii sharan main jaakar paas hone kii gati praapt karte hai
 This joke can only happen to the youth of India, they do not know because they are listening to the latest song put ear piece (EP) in their ears
 hamane is series ke dauraan dekha ki jainarayan laal mohan laal purohit rajkeey mahavidhyalay, falaudi main 1900 chaatr hai magar ek bhi permanent teacher nahin hai
 SKM College, Begusarai has a teacher at 1200 students
 aar ke college, madhubani main 500 par ek shikshak hai
 Jain College, Ara has one teacher on 180 students
 maharaja college, aara main 270 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 You have seen the ratio of student to teacher, there is no need to beat the head, in terms of this number, the number of sanctioned posts of teachers in every college will also multiply and the lottery will open for the qualified candidates who pass the NET exam
 magar bharat ke shikshak banane kii yogyata rakhane vaale berojgaaron kii ek or khubi he
 They also do not want to get a job
 unamem se bhi kaiyon ko main dekhtaa hum, zyada samay hindu muslim main lage rahete hai, naukari or rojgaar kii sambhaavna par kam baat karte hai
 In Srikrishna Mahila College, a college in Begusarai, Bihar, ten and a half thousand students study, but there are only thirty sanctioned posts for teachers
 jabaki hona chahie 350
 Only 9 out of this thirty are lecturer professors
 sochie halaat kitne gambhir hai, aap kehete hai uniwarsity bojhil ho chukaa he
 Hearing the information that our colleague Syed Meraz has sent about the Jain College of Ara in Bihar, you will eat ten puris more
 jain college aara ke galiyare main baithe ye bachche group banaakar padhai kar rahe hai
 Preparing for competition, finding our own way
 aara main aapako college ke khandhiron ke bich isi tarah chaatr samooh main padhate mil jaaenge
 Looking at this picture, you can say that there is no lack in the desire to read them, but their talent is limited to pass the examination of the railway
 agar in honhaar chaatro ko mauka mila hota, yogya shikshak mili hote to ye kya nahin kar sakate the
 Governments crushed their dreams
 inhen jati or dharm main baant kar adhamra kar diya he
 In 1918 Harprasad Das Jain founded the Adinath Trust and expressed his desire to establish a college for the promotion of higher education in Ara Nagar
 1919 main is kaam ke liye 60,000 rupee daan main bhi die, sochie saal 1919 or rupaya 60,000 taaki aara main ucch shiksha kaa prasar ho
 If the college could not be formed in his life, then in 1942 the Adinath Trust again donated 1 lakh 55 thousand rupees
 hamaari sarkaron ne harprasad jain ji ke sapanom kii bhi hatya kar di he
 Is strangled
 1945 main dumraanv maharaj shri ram ranvijay prasad ne aara railway stesan ke paas 21 bighaa 10 kaththa jameen di
 If you go from Delhi to Patna by train, Jain College Ara is seen on the left side
 lekin kitnon ko pataa he ki is college ke banane ke sapanom ko hamaare netaaon ne hatya kar di
 There are a total of 17 departments in which studies from intermediate to PG
 isamen shikshakon kii kul sankhya 132 honi chahie jabaki maatr 65 hai
 a question arises again and again, how do those colleges get grades where the number of teachers is so low
 kya nack kii grading kaa koi matlab he, jain college aara kii kuch imaaraton ko nack kii team ke chakkar main teen teen baar rangana potna pad gaya
 After all, where there should be 132 teachers, 65 are there, then what is any grading being given to it, to keep the youth of Ara from pretending that it has a b grade, keep taking admission here and then instead of class corridor Keep preparing for railway guard by hitting Mundi
 bharat sarkaar ko nack system kii hi jaanch kerani chahie ki yah sab ho kya rahaa he
 Naik's team charges college for going everywhere and giving grades
 jain college aara main saadhe gyaarah hazaar bachche padhate hai
 According to this number, the number of sanctioned posts for teachers here should be between 350 and 400 but the number of sanctioned posts is only 132
 is 132 main se 65 shikshak hi hai
 The old principal here ruined the college a lot, but the newcomers who are coming here are trying a lot which has no result
 praachaarya ne likhit main diya he ki yahaan shikshak kii baari kami he
 You know how big a problem it is to give a problem in writing in India
 jain college aara ke purvi get par open mutralay he
 The toilet in the college is in such a bad condition that the teachers had to go home, in fact you must have understood that they too would have resorted to any such eastern gate
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki nae principal ke aane ke pehle to aap college ke shauchalay kaa istemaal bhi nahin kar sakate hai, unhone saaf safai par dhyaan diya he
 Principal sir has understood that the recruitment of teachers is not just about him, so he has recourse on the biometric system so that those who do not come can start coming
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri rajkumaar singh aara ke hi saansad hai
 But it has to be understood that this problem is being brought up for twenty-five years
 aakhir aara jo ki itnaa urjavan shahar he apane ek college ko kyon nahin sambhaal sakaa
 Then what is the meaning of saying that the Ara district is home, who is afraid of what? us saahas kaa kya fal mila shahar ko
 The Maharaja College was earlier known as Judge Sahi's Kothi
 dumraanv ke maharaj camel singh ne apane pita kii yaad main college ke liye 25 bigha zamin daan main di thi
 Some of its buildings are colored paint
 magar andar ye yah college bhi bharat kii ucch shiksha kii nimnatam sthiti kaa adarsh udhaaharan he
 Ten thousand students study here
 main to sunakar hairaan rah gaya ki yahaan inter se piji tak itihaas vishay main 2500 chaatr padhate hai
 One must find out why history is so popular here, whether the teachers are amazing or the students know that the future is ruined, so why not live it and become history
 2500 chaatro ko itihaas padhaane ke liye is college main puure college main ek hi sthaayee shikshak he
 Do you still find the university series boring? yahaan par ek sthaayee shikshak ke bharose inter se piji ke 2500 chaatr itihaas pard rahe hai
 There are three temporary teachers who do not receive salary
 1997 se in shikshakon ko paisa nahin mila he
 Hearing all this, how do you feel, are you in Naya India or are you in Gaya India
 1997 se kisi ko paisa na mili to wo kyon padhaaye yaa kyon padhaa rahaa he, kya system ne naukari kii ummid dekar insaan se insaan hone kaa haq chin liya he
 750 students are in Physics Honors and 4 are teachers
 kya yah sab dekh sunakar aapkaa kalejaa nahin fatataa ki 2500 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 Maharaja College has 82 posts, but 37 teachers
 chaatro kii sankhya ke hisaab se dekhenge to yahaan shikshakon ke manzur padon kii sankhya 300 se 400 honi chahie magar manzur padon main bhi ghapala he

 kya uniwarsity yaa college main aane vaale chaatro ke paas yah soochna hoti he, kya unke us farm yaa broshar par likhaa hota he jise ve 1000 se 1500 rupee dekar kharidte hai, kya us par yah nahin likhaa hona chahie ki aapkaa yahaan swaagat he, ujisi ke hisaab se to har chaatro par ek shikshak hona chahie magar ham 300 se 400 chaatro par ek shikshak denge
 Is this the reason that when not understood in class, students get the speed of passing in the shelter of Rekha Guide, Jaspal Guide and Champion Guide
 yah mazaaq bharat ke yuvaaon ke saath hi ho saktaa he, unhen pataa nahin chalata kyonki ve kaan main year pis (eepi) daale letest sang sun rahe hote hai
 During this series we saw that there are 1900 students in Jayanarayan Lal Mohan Lal Purohit Government College, Phalodi, but there is not a single permanent teacher
 eskeem college, begusarai main 1200 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 RK College, Madhubani has one teacher at 500
 jain college, aara main 180 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 Maharaja College, Ara has a teacher at 270 students
 aapane chaatr or shikshak kaa anupaat dekh hi liya, sar peetane kii zarurat nahin he, is sankhya ke lihaaz se har college main shikshakon ke manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kai guna ho jaaegi or net pariksha paas karne vaale yogya ummidavaaron kii lottery khul jaaegi
 But there is another quality of unemployed people who have the ability to become teachers of India
 ve bhi nahin chaahate hai ki naukari mili
 i see many of them, Hindus spend more time in Muslim, less talk on job and employment prospects
 bihar ke begusarai kaa ek college shrikrishna mahila college main saadhe das hazaar chatraayen padhati hai magar yahaan shikshakon ke liye manjuur padon kii sankhya maatr tees he
 While there should be 350
 is tees main se bhi 9 hi lekturer professor hai
 Think how serious the situation is, you say the university has become cumbersome
 hamaare sahyogi syed meraaj ne bihar ke aara ke jain college ke bare main jo soochna bheji he, use sunakar aap das puri zyaada kha lenge
 Sitting in the corridor of Jain College Ara, these children are studying in groups
 compatishan kii taiyaari kar apana rasta khud khoj rahe hai
 In Ara you will find students studying in the same way among the ruins of the college
 is tasviir ko dekh kar aap kah sakate hai ki inamen padhane kii ichha main koi kami nahin he lekin inaki pratibha railway ke imtahaan paas kar lene tak hi simit rah jaati he
 If these promising students had got an opportunity, if they had got qualified teachers, what could they not have done
 sarkaron ne inke sapane kuchal die
 By dividing them into caste and religion, they have become incomplete
 1918 main harprasad das jain ne adinath trust kii sthapana kii thi or aara nagar main ucch shiksha ke prasar hetu ek mahavidhyalay kii sthapana kii ichha vyakt kii
 In 1919, 60,000 rupees were also donated for this work, think of the year 1919 and 60,000 rupees to spread higher education in Ara
 unke jivan main college nahin ban sakaa to 1942 main adinath trust ne phir se 1 lakh 55 hazaar rupaya daan diya
 Our governments have also killed the dreams of Harprasad Jain
 galaa ghont diya he
 In 1945, Dumraon Maharaj Shri Ram Ranvijay Prasad gave 21 bigha 10 katha land near Ara railway station
 aap dilli se patna rail se jaaenge to baayin taraf jain college aara dikhataa he
 But how many know that the dreams of becoming this college were murdered by our leaders
 isamen kul 17 vibhaag he jisamen intermidiet se lekar piji tak kii padhai hoti he
 The total number of teachers in this should be 132 while there are only 65
 ek sawaal baar baar uthta he ki jahaan teacher kii sankhya itani kam he un collejon ko grad kaise mil jaataa he
 Does Naik's grading make any sense? Some buildings at Jain College Ara were painted three times under the guise of Naik's team
 aakhir jahaan 132 shikshak hone chahie, 65 hi hai to phir use koi bhi grading kis chiz kii di ja rahi he, kya aara ke naujavaanon ko jhansa dene ke liye ki ise bi grad hasil he aap yahaan admician lete rahiye or phir class kii jagah baraamde main mundi gaadkar railway guard kii taiyaari karte rahiye
 The Indian government should investigate the NAC system only to see what is happening
 nack kii team har jagah jane or grad dene ke liye fees leti he college se
 Eleven and a half thousand children study in Jain College Ara
 is sankhya ke hisaab se yahaan shikshakon ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya 350 se 400 ke bich honi chahie lekin manzur padon kii sankhya 132 hi he
 Out of this 132, 65 are teachers
 yahaan ke puraane principal ne college ko kaaphi barbaad kiya lekin jo nae aaen hai wo kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jiskaa koi nateeja nahin he
 The principal has given in writing that there is a huge shortage of teachers here
 aap jaanate hi hai ki bharat main kisi samasya ko likhit main de dena kitni badi baat hoti he
 There is an open urinal at the eastern gate of Jain College Ara
 college main shauchalay kaa itnaa bura haal he ki shikshakon ko ghar janaa padataa tha, darasal aap samaj hi sakate honge ki ve bhi aise kisi purvi get kaa hi sahaara le lete honge
 Teachers told that before the arrival of new principal, you cannot even use the college toilets, they have paid attention to cleanliness
 principal sahab samaj gaye hai ki shikshakon kii bhartee unke bas kii baat nahin he isliye unhen biometric system par hi sahaara he taaki jo nahin aate hai wo to aane lag jaaen
 a story of Jain College Ara's toilet is revealed
 yahaan ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he jabaki yahaan paanch se chah hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The girls' common room has one toilet room with four toilets
 ladakiyon ke liye alag se ek shauchalay or bana tha lekin wo do dhai saal se band tha
 When the college opened the toilet to prepare for the reception of Naik's team, it had boys' urinals in it
 aisa ghotaalaa or kahaan ho saktaa he
 The toilet was again closed so that the college would not be in disrepute
 aap sochie paanch hazaar ladakiyon par kul paanch shauchalay hai
 While 6 girls should have a toilet
 kya is sthiti main chatraayen college aati hongi
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs is Rajkumar Singh Ara's MP
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki is samasya ko bees pachis saal se paala posa ja rahaa he
 After all, why Ara, which is such an energetic city, could not manage a college of its own
 phir aara zila ghar ba, koun baat ke dar ba kehane kaa kya matlab he
 What was the result of that courage for the city
 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 i was surprised to hear that 2500 students study in history subject from Inter to PG
 kisi ko pataa lagaana chahie ki yahaan itihaas itnaa lokapriy kyon he, kya shikshak kamaal ke hai yaa phir chaatro ko pataa he ki bhavishya to barbaad ho chukaa he to kyon na jite jite ji itihaas ban jaaen
 This college has only one permanent teacher in the entire college to teach history to 2500 students
 kya aapako ab bhi uniwarsity series boring lag rahi he
 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher
 teen asthaayee shikshak hai jinhen vetan nahin miltaa he
 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money
 yah sab sunate hue aapako kya lag rahaa he, aap nayaa india main he yaa gaya india main hai
 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job
 750 chaatr physics onors main he or 4 shikshak hi hai

 BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has spoken to ECL officials and raised the issue
 aapane chaatr or shikshak kaa anupaat dekh hi liya, sar peetane kii zarurat nahin he, is sankhya ke lihaaz se har college main shikshakon ke manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kai guna ho jaaegi or net pariksha paas karne vaale yogya ummidavaaron kii lottery khul jaaegi
 But there is another quality of unemployed people who have the ability to become teachers of India
 ve bhi nahin chaahate hai ki naukari mili
 i see many of them, Hindus spend more time in Muslim, less talk on job and employment prospects
 bihar ke begusarai kaa ek college shrikrishna mahila college main saadhe das hazaar chatraayen padhati hai magar yahaan shikshakon ke liye manjuur padon kii sankhya maatr tees he
 While there should be 350
 is tees main se bhi 9 hi lekturer professor hai
 Think how serious the situation is, you say the university has become cumbersome
 hamaare sahyogi syed meraaj ne bihar ke aara ke jain college ke bare main jo soochna bheji he, use sunakar aap das puri zyaada kha lenge
 Sitting in the corridor of Jain College Ara, these children are studying in groups
 compatishan kii taiyaari kar apana rasta khud khoj rahe hai
 In Ara you will find students studying in the same way among the ruins of the college
 is tasviir ko dekh kar aap kah sakate hai ki inamen padhane kii ichha main koi kami nahin he lekin inaki pratibha railway ke imtahaan paas kar lene tak hi simit rah jaati he
 If these promising students had got an opportunity, if they had got qualified teachers, what could they not have done
 sarkaron ne inke sapane kuchal die
 By dividing them into caste and religion, they have become incomplete
 1918 main harprasad das jain ne adinath trust kii sthapana kii thi or aara nagar main ucch shiksha ke prasar hetu ek mahavidhyalay kii sthapana kii ichha vyakt kii
 In 1919, 60,000 rupees were also donated for this work, think of the year 1919 and 60,000 rupees to spread higher education in Ara
 unke jivan main college nahin ban sakaa to 1942 main adinath trust ne phir se 1 lakh 55 hazaar rupaya daan diya
 Our governments have also killed the dreams of Harprasad Jain
 galaa ghont diya he
 In 1945, Dumraon Maharaj Shri Ram Ranvijay Prasad gave 21 bigha 10 katha land near Ara railway station
 aap dilli se patna rail se jaaenge to baayin taraf jain college aara dikhataa he
 But how many know that the dreams of becoming this college were murdered by our leaders
 isamen kul 17 vibhaag he jisamen intermidiet se lekar piji tak kii padhai hoti he
 The total number of teachers in this should be 132 while there are only 65
 ek sawaal baar baar uthta he ki jahaan teacher kii sankhya itani kam he un collejon ko grad kaise mil jaataa he
 Does Naik's grading make any sense? Some buildings at Jain College Ara were painted three times under the guise of Naik's team
 aakhir jahaan 132 shikshak hone chahie, 65 hi hai to phir use koi bhi grading kis chiz kii di ja rahi he, kya aara ke naujavaanon ko jhansa dene ke liye ki ise bi grad hasil he aap yahaan admician lete rahiye or phir class kii jagah baraamde main mundi gaadkar railway guard kii taiyaari karte rahiye
 The Indian government should investigate the NAC system only to see what is happening
 nack kii team har jagah jane or grad dene ke liye fees leti he college se
 Eleven and a half thousand children study in Jain College Ara
 is sankhya ke hisaab se yahaan shikshakon ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya 350 se 400 ke bich honi chahie lekin manzur padon kii sankhya 132 hi he
 Out of this 132, 65 are teachers
 yahaan ke puraane principal ne college ko kaaphi barbaad kiya lekin jo nae aaen hai wo kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jiskaa koi nateeja nahin he
 The principal has given in writing that there is a huge shortage of teachers here
 aap jaanate hi hai ki bharat main kisi samasya ko likhit main de dena kitni badi baat hoti he
 There is an open urinal at the eastern gate of Jain College Ara
 college main shauchalay kaa itnaa bura haal he ki shikshakon ko ghar janaa padataa tha, darasal aap samaj hi sakate honge ki ve bhi aise kisi purvi get kaa hi sahaara le lete honge
 Teachers told that before the arrival of new principal, you cannot even use the college toilets, they have paid attention to cleanliness
 principal sahab samaj gaye hai ki shikshakon kii bhartee unke bas kii baat nahin he isliye unhen biometric system par hi sahaara he taaki jo nahin aate hai wo to aane lag jaaen
 a story of Jain College Ara's toilet is revealed
 yahaan ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he jabaki yahaan paanch se chah hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The girls' common room has one toilet room with four toilets
 ladakiyon ke liye alag se ek shauchalay or bana tha lekin wo do dhai saal se band tha
 When the college opened the toilet to prepare for the reception of Naik's team, it had boys' urinals in it
 aisa ghotaalaa or kahaan ho saktaa he
 The toilet was again closed so that the college would not be in disrepute
 aap sochie paanch hazaar ladakiyon par kul paanch shauchalay hai
 While 6 girls should have a toilet
 kya is sthiti main chatraayen college aati hongi
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs is Rajkumar Singh Ara's MP
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki is samasya ko bees pachis saal se paala posa ja rahaa he
 After all, why Ara, which is such an energetic city, could not manage a college of its own
 phir aara zila ghar ba, koun baat ke dar ba kehane kaa kya matlab he
 What was the result of that courage for the city
 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 i was surprised to hear that 2500 students study in history subject from Inter to PG
 kisi ko pataa lagaana chahie ki yahaan itihaas itnaa lokapriy kyon he, kya shikshak kamaal ke hai yaa phir chaatro ko pataa he ki bhavishya to barbaad ho chukaa he to kyon na jite jite ji itihaas ban jaaen
 This college has only one permanent teacher in the entire college to teach history to 2500 students
 kya aapako ab bhi uniwarsity series boring lag rahi he
 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher
 teen asthaayee shikshak hai jinhen vetan nahin miltaa he
 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money
 yah sab sunate hue aapako kya lag rahaa he, aap nayaa india main he yaa gaya india main hai
 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job
 750 chaatr physics onors main he or 4 shikshak hi hai
 Doesn't your heart burst when you see this, that there are one teacher on 2500 students
 maharaja college main 82 pad manzur hai magar 37 shikshak hi hai
 If we look at the number of students, then the number of sanctioned posts of teachers should be 300 to 400, but there is a mismatch in sanctioned posts as well

 Preparing for competition, finding our own way
 aara main aapako college ke khandhiron ke bich isi tarah chaatr samooh main padhate mil jaaenge
 Looking at this picture, you can say that there is no lack in the desire to read them, but their talent is limited to pass the examination of the railway
 agar in honhaar chaatro ko mauka mila hota, yogya shikshak mili hote to ye kya nahin kar sakate the
 Governments crushed their dreams
 inhen jati or dharm main baant kar adhamra kar diya he
 In 1918 Harprasad Das Jain founded the Adinath Trust and expressed his desire to establish a college for the promotion of higher education in Ara Nagar
 1919 main is kaam ke liye 60,000 rupee daan main bhi die, sochie saal 1919 or rupaya 60,000 taaki aara main ucch shiksha kaa prasar ho
 If the college could not be formed in his life, then in 1942 the Adinath Trust again donated 1 lakh 55 thousand rupees
 hamaari sarkaron ne harprasad jain ji ke sapanom kii bhi hatya kar di he
 Is strangled
 1945 main dumraanv maharaj shri ram ranvijay prasad ne aara railway stesan ke paas 21 bighaa 10 kaththa jameen di
 If you go from Delhi to Patna by train, Jain College Ara is seen on the left side
 lekin kitnon ko pataa he ki is college ke banane ke sapanom ko hamaare netaaon ne hatya kar di
 There are a total of 17 departments in which studies from intermediate to PG
 isamen shikshakon kii kul sankhya 132 honi chahie jabaki maatr 65 hai
 a question arises again and again, how do those colleges get grades where the number of teachers is so low
 kya nack kii grading kaa koi matlab he, jain college aara kii kuch imaaraton ko nack kii team ke chakkar main teen teen baar rangana potna pad gaya
 After all, where there should be 132 teachers, 65 are there, then what is any grading being given to it, to keep the youth of Ara from pretending that it has a b grade, keep taking admission here and then instead of class corridor Keep preparing for railway guard by hitting Mundi
 bharat sarkaar ko nack system kii hi jaanch kerani chahie ki yah sab ho kya rahaa he
 Naik's team charges college for going everywhere and giving grades
 jain college aara main saadhe gyaarah hazaar bachche padhate hai
 According to this number, the number of sanctioned posts for teachers here should be between 350 and 400 but the number of sanctioned posts is only 132
 is 132 main se 65 shikshak hi hai
 The old principal here ruined the college a lot, but the newcomers who are coming here are trying a lot which has no result
 praachaarya ne likhit main diya he ki yahaan shikshak kii baari kami he
 You know how big a problem it is to give a problem in writing in India
 jain college aara ke purvi get par open mutralay he
 The toilet in the college is in such a bad condition that the teachers had to go home, in fact you must have understood that they too would have resorted to any such eastern gate
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki nae principal ke aane ke pehle to aap college ke shauchalay kaa istemaal bhi nahin kar sakate hai, unhone saaf safai par dhyaan diya he
 Principal sir has understood that the recruitment of teachers is not just about him, so he has recourse on the biometric system so that those who do not come can start coming
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri rajkumaar singh aara ke hi saansad hai
 But it has to be understood that this problem is being brought up for twenty-five years
 aakhir aara jo ki itnaa urjavan shahar he apane ek college ko kyon nahin sambhaal sakaa
 Then what is the meaning of saying that the Ara district is home, who is afraid of what? us saahas kaa kya fal mila shahar ko
 The Maharaja College was earlier known as Judge Sahi's Kothi
 dumraanv ke maharaj camel singh ne apane pita kii yaad main college ke liye 25 bigha zamin daan main di thi
 Some of its buildings are colored paint
 magar andar ye yah college bhi bharat kii ucch shiksha kii nimnatam sthiti kaa adarsh udhaaharan he
 Ten thousand students study here
 main to sunakar hairaan rah gaya ki yahaan inter se piji tak itihaas vishay main 2500 chaatr padhate hai
 One must find out why history is so popular here, whether the teachers are amazing or the students know that the future is ruined, so why not live it and become history
 2500 chaatro ko itihaas padhaane ke liye is college main puure college main ek hi sthaayee shikshak he
 Do you still find the university series boring? yahaan par ek sthaayee shikshak ke bharose inter se piji ke 2500 chaatr itihaas pard rahe hai
 There are three temporary teachers who do not receive salary
 1997 se in shikshakon ko paisa nahin mila he
 Hearing all this, how do you feel, are you in Naya India or are you in Gaya India
 1997 se kisi ko paisa na mili to wo kyon padhaaye yaa kyon padhaa rahaa he, kya system ne naukari kii ummid dekar insaan se insaan hone kaa haq chin liya he
 750 students are in Physics Honors and 4 are teachers
 kya yah sab dekh sunakar aapkaa kalejaa nahin fatataa ki 2500 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 Maharaja College has 82 posts, but 37 teachers
 chaatro kii sankhya ke hisaab se dekhenge to yahaan shikshakon ke manzur padon kii sankhya 300 se 400 honi chahie magar manzur padon main bhi ghapala he
 Listen to this student and think about the condition of youth in our university system
 bir kunwar singh uniwarsity ke tahat ye donon college aate hai
 If the birth anniversary of Bir Kunwar Singh falls, all ministers will arrive with a car and start telling their heirs, but this is the condition of the university named after him

 This student is not allowed inside the college
 kya ye zyaadati nahin he ki ek chaatr ko college main na aane diya jaae, pradarshan karne kii itani badi sazaa di jaae, phir jin collejon main teacher nahin hai, padhai nahin hoti he unki sazaa chaatr kise den

 On 6 November, a Panchayat of students of this college held in Lohria Kali temple, in which Congress district president Deepika Pandey Singh arrived

 a question arises again and again, how do those colleges get grades where the number of teachers is so low
 kya nack kii grading kaa koi matlab he, jain college aara kii kuch imaaraton ko nack kii team ke chakkar main teen teen baar rangana potna pad gaya
 After all, where there should be 132 teachers, 65 are there, then what is any grading being given to it, to keep the youth of Ara from pretending that it has a b grade, keep taking admission here and then instead of class corridor Keep preparing for railway guard by hitting Mundi
 bharat sarkaar ko nack system kii hi jaanch kerani chahie ki yah sab ho kya rahaa he
 Naik's team charges college for going everywhere and giving grades
 jain college aara main saadhe gyaarah hazaar bachche padhate hai
 According to this number, the number of sanctioned posts for teachers here should be between 350 and 400 but the number of sanctioned posts is only 132
 is 132 main se 65 shikshak hi hai
 The old principal here ruined the college a lot, but the newcomers who are coming here are trying a lot which has no result
 praachaarya ne likhit main diya he ki yahaan shikshak kii baari kami he
 You know how big a problem it is to give a problem in writing in India
 jain college aara ke purvi get par open mutralay he
 The toilet in the college is in such a bad condition that the teachers had to go home, in fact you must have understood that they too would have resorted to any such eastern gate
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki nae principal ke aane ke pehle to aap college ke shauchalay kaa istemaal bhi nahin kar sakate hai, unhone saaf safai par dhyaan diya he
 Principal sir has understood that the recruitment of teachers is not just about him, so he has recourse on the biometric system so that those who do not come can start coming
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri rajkumaar singh aara ke hi saansad hai
 But it has to be understood that this problem is being brought up for twenty-five years
 aakhir aara jo ki itnaa urjavan shahar he apane ek college ko kyon nahin sambhaal sakaa
 Then what is the meaning of saying that the Ara district is home, who is afraid of what? us saahas kaa kya fal mila shahar ko
 The Maharaja College was earlier known as Judge Sahi's Kothi

 Ten thousand students study here
 main to sunakar hairaan rah gaya ki yahaan inter se piji tak itihaas vishay main 2500 chaatr padhate hai
 One must find out why history is so popular here, whether the teachers are amazing or the students know that the future is ruined, so why not live it and become history
 2500 chaatro ko itihaas padhaane ke liye is college main puure college main ek hi sthaayee shikshak he
 Do you still find the university series boring? yahaan par ek sthaayee shikshak ke bharose inter se piji ke 2500 chaatr itihaas pard rahe hai
 There are three temporary teachers who do not receive salary

 Eleven and a half thousand children study in Jain College Ara
 is sankhya ke hisaab se yahaan shikshakon ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya 350 se 400 ke bich honi chahie lekin manzur padon kii sankhya 132 hi he
 Out of this 132, 65 are teachers
 yahaan ke puraane principal ne college ko kaaphi barbaad kiya lekin jo nae aaen hai wo kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jiskaa koi nateeja nahin he
 The principal has given in writing that there is a huge shortage of teachers here
 aap jaanate hi hai ki bharat main kisi samasya ko likhit main de dena kitni badi baat hoti he
 There is an open urinal at the eastern gate of Jain College Ara
 college main shauchalay kaa itnaa bura haal he ki shikshakon ko ghar janaa padataa tha, darasal aap samaj hi sakate honge ki ve bhi aise kisi purvi get kaa hi sahaara le lete honge
 Teachers told that before the arrival of new principal, you cannot even use the college toilets, they have paid attention to cleanliness
 principal sahab samaj gaye hai ki shikshakon kii bhartee unke bas kii baat nahin he isliye unhen biometric system par hi sahaara he taaki jo nahin aate hai wo to aane lag jaaen
 a story of Jain College Ara's toilet is revealed
 yahaan ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he jabaki yahaan paanch se chah hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The girls' common room has one toilet room with four toilets
 ladakiyon ke liye alag se ek shauchalay or bana tha lekin wo do dhai saal se band tha
 When the college opened the toilet to prepare for the reception of Naik's team, it had boys' urinals in it
 aisa ghotaalaa or kahaan ho saktaa he
 The toilet was again closed so that the college would not be in disrepute
 aap sochie paanch hazaar ladakiyon par kul paanch shauchalay hai
 While 6 girls should have a toilet
 kya is sthiti main chatraayen college aati hongi
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs is Rajkumar Singh Ara's MP
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki is samasya ko bees pachis saal se paala posa ja rahaa he
 After all, why Ara, which is such an energetic city, could not manage a college of its own
 phir aara zila ghar ba, koun baat ke dar ba kehane kaa kya matlab he
 What was the result of that courage for the city
 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 i was surprised to hear that 2500 students study in history subject from Inter to PG
 kisi ko pataa lagaana chahie ki yahaan itihaas itnaa lokapriy kyon he, kya shikshak kamaal ke hai yaa phir chaatro ko pataa he ki bhavishya to barbaad ho chukaa he to kyon na jite jite ji itihaas ban jaaen
 This college has only one permanent teacher in the entire college to teach history to 2500 students
 kya aapako ab bhi uniwarsity series boring lag rahi he
 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher
 teen asthaayee shikshak hai jinhen vetan nahin miltaa he
 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money
 yah sab sunate hue aapako kya lag rahaa he, aap nayaa india main he yaa gaya india main hai
 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job
 750 chaatr physics onors main he or 4 shikshak hi hai
 Doesn't your heart burst when you see this, that there are one teacher on 2500 students
 maharaja college main 82 pad manzur hai magar 37 shikshak hi hai
 If we look at the number of students, then the number of sanctioned posts of teachers should be 300 to 400, but there is a mismatch in sanctioned posts as well
 aap is chaatr ko suniye or sochie ki hamaari uniwarsity system ne naujavaanon kii kya haalat kar di he
 Both these colleges come under Bir Kunwar Singh University
 bir kunwar singh kii jayanti pad jaae to sab mantri car lekar pahunch jaaenge or unka vaaris bataane lagenge magar unke naam par bani uniwarsity kii ye haalat he
 Employees are saying that they have moved from APL to BPL
 sarkaron ne collejon kii taraf dhyaan dena band kar diya he
 No leader wants to debate higher education because it cannot be cured now
 karmchaariyon kii maangen teen sutri se shuru kar gyaarah sutri, solah sutri ho gai hai
 The dharnas have been ineffective from time to time
 loktantr main lok kii durdasha kii prayogshaala kaa naam he uniwarsity
 The condition of Central University Ajmer can be understood through old photographs of the movement
 yahaan ke visi jab har samasya ke jawaab main kehete the ki main sthai nahin hum to yahaan sintabar 2015 main baqayda sthai visi kii maang ko lekar chaatro ne 14 dinon kii hadtaal kii
 AK priest came as Permanent VC but the problems also became permanent
 lihaaza sitambar 2016 main chaatro ne phir virodh pradarshan kiya
 The VC promised to accept all the demands but retracted from the student union elections
 chaatr ad gaye to 50 se 60 andolankaaree chaatro ko 15 dinon ke liye resticket kar diya gaya
 In March 2017, when the students demonstrated about the mess, four students were fired for one session only
 chaatr hoicourt gaye, hoicourt ne kaha ki college jaaiye
 One of these students has not been withdrawn yet
 is chaatr ko college ke andar aane kii manaahi he
 Is it not too much that a student should not be allowed to come to college, to be given such a huge punishment for performing, then to whom the student should be punished for colleges which are not teachers
 sunil chopra ko hastal se niklaa diya he
 How will the situation improve when the students do not raise their voices, do not perform sit-ins
 central uniwarsity ke research scoler ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri satyapal singh ko patr likh kar kai baton par unka dhyaan kheenchna chaha he
 It has been written that the cost of VC housing has increased from 1 crore 62 lakh to 2 crore 25 lakh
 cricket maidan kii laagat 1 karod 72 lakh se badhkar 3 karod 75 lakh ho gai he
 Till date, nothing has been prepared for the field, pitch, practice net
 sieji ne bhi yahaan darjanon aniyamittaaon ko darj kiya he jise dabaa diya gaya
 We emailed VC but no response was received
 ujisi ne world class uniwarsity banane ke liye jo guideline banaai he uske anusaar vahaan edock teacher nahin ho sakate hai
 When 20 colleges cannot have adhoc or guest teacher, how is the education going on in the trust of guest teacher in twenty thousand colleges
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke college to edock ke bharose hi chal rahe hai
 On November 7, Delhi University Teachers Association is going to sit in front of VC office
 2009 se shikshakon ko pramotion nahin mila he
 The governing body has not been formed in colleges
 yah sab dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he
 Adhoc teachers of Delhi University are also going to agitate from 9 November
 visi offis ke saamne gheraa daalo, deraa daalo andolan hoga
 The University Series will continue
 swatantraaa senaanee or samaajawaadee netaa acharya narendra dev kaa naam aaj bhi upi kii raajnneeti main liya jaataa he magar unke naam par bane krishi vishvavidhyalay kii bhi haalat karaab he
 The comments 1975 main acharya narendra dev agriculture uniwarsity kii imaaraten baahar se dekhne par thik thaak lagati hai
 Perhaps we have the same view that if the building and the campus are good then the college or university will be fine
 magar jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav yahaan gaye to pataa chalaa ki yahaan 42 vibhaagadhyaksh hone chahie the magar 32 hi hai
 There is a shortage of professors and assistant professors
 lab kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 Looking at this lab, you will not feel that it belongs to any university
 chaatro ne bataaya ki unke hastal main shauchalay bahut ganda he
 According to a news report by Amar Ujala, the Vice Chancellor himself has complained to the Governor about a massive scam in Narendra Dev Agricultural University
 rajyapal se jab yah sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki koi shikaayat nahin mili he
 It is printed in Amar Ujala
 sansadhano kii kami he varanaa ichha thi ki krishi vishvavidhyalayon par gaharaai se report karata
 Their condition is also not very good
 hamaare sahyogi arshadeep ne ludhiana se bataaya he ki punjab agriculture uniwarsity main 40 pratishat teaching or non teaching ke pad khaali hai
 In the 18th issue of the University Series, we showed how the Lalmatiya Adivasi Inter College in Godda is on the verge of falling
 is kalege ke thik neeche koyala mafia ne surang banaakar koyala nikaal liya he jiske kaaran college kii buniyaad kamazor ho gai he
 The water level has disappeared
 college kabhi bhi bharbhara kar gir saktaa he
 Students also face pollution due to the explosion in the nearby mine
 chaatr yahaan aate hai to magar haaziri banaakar bhaag jate hai, is dar se ki kahin imaarat na gir jaae
 This has happened in our story that small politics has started happening
 6 november ko lohadia kaali mandir main is college ke chaatro kii ek panchayat hui jisamen congress kii zila adhyaksh deepika pandeya singh pahunchi
 The idea was that this college would be demanded for the building and land
 chaatr panchayat main mata pita bhi aae the
 Questions also arose about the role of the principal
 yahaan chaatro ne wo baat bhi bataai jiskaa pataa hamen nahin tha
 He said that before taking scholarship, one has to pay bribe
 deepika ne godda ke kamishnar ko patr bhi diya he
 Leaders should know in advance about such a college
 yah nahin ki tivi main aayaa to pradarshan karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has spoken to ECL officials and raised the issue
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri rajkumaar singh aara ke hi saansad hai
 But it has to be understood that this problem is being brought up for twenty-five years
 aakhir aara jo ki itnaa urjavan shahar he apane ek college ko kyon nahin sambhaal sakaa
 Then what is the meaning of saying that the Ara district is home, who is afraid of what? us saahas kaa kya fal mila shahar ko
 The Maharaja College was earlier known as Judge Sahi's Kothi

 After the bjp-shiv Sena's claim on Fadnavis for the CM post in Maharashtra, Shah's clear message on the CM post has been sounded in Maharashtra Assembly elections
 mukhyamantri pad ko lekar bijepi ke saath-saath shivasena kii bhi najar he
 Amid the claim of Shiv Sena, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that CM post is already fixed for me
 iske baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi unke bayaan par muhar lagaate hue kaha ki devendra fadanvis mukhyamantri hai or aane vaale samay main bhi vahi siem rahenge
 It became clear that the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra would not be from Shiv Sena
 india today conklev-2019 ke manch se maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki unhen shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bete aditya thakare ko upmukhyamantri banane par aitraaj nahin he
 But the Chief Minister will keep the same position
 saath hi unhone kaha ki jis tarah se shivasena netaa aditya thakare sakriy politics main hissaa le rahe hai, wo unka swaagat karte hai
 Fadnavis' claim was also approved by BJP President Amit Shah in Maharashtra on Sunday
 amit shah ne anuchhed 370 par ayojit ek kaarykram main kaha ki maharashtra kii janata ne jaahir kar diya ki chunaav ke baad devendra fadanvis hi maharashtra ke mukhyamantri honge
 Shah's statement is also a message to the Shiv Sena and a blunt reply from the BJP
 darasal maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan ho gaya he, lekin bijepi or shivasena ke bich seat shering par abhi tak sahmati nahin ban pai he
 Given the changed political equation, BJP wants to contest more seats than Shiv Sena
 vahiin, shivasena loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan tay 50-50 formula ke mutabik seat bantwaaraa chaahati he
 But the BJP does not agree to that
 vahiin mukhyamantri pad ko lekar bhi kuch sanshay tha
 However, after Fadnavis, now bjp's stance has become clear with the statement of Amit Shah and along with this, the way of claim for the post of Chief Minister of Shiv Sena has also been closed
 haalanki bijepi kii ore se shivasena ko upmukhyamantri kii post dene par koi aitraaj nahin he
 If a coalition government is formed in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, will Aditya Thackeray be the Deputy Chief Minister

 We cannot make this decision
 sarkaar kaa jo pichhlaa vistaar hua, tab maine shivasena se poocha tha ki kya ve apni party ke kisi shaks ko dipti siem bananaa chaahate hai
 But Shiv Sena had said that time is short, so do not want to make anyone a deputy CM right now '
 devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki raajnneeti main sab kuch mumkin he
 Aditya Thackeray is learning politics tricks very well
 jaruri nahin ki sakriy raajnneeti main na utarane kaa jo faisla bala sahab thakare or uddhav thakare ne liya, usee par aditya bhi chalem
 Sometimes they have to take the reins of Shiv Sena
 darasal loksabhaa chunaav ke baad shivasena ne siem post par apni daavedaari pesh kerani shuru kar di thi
 In view of this, parallel to the Jan Ashirwad Yatra of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Aditya Thackeray, son of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, is also busy in creating an atmosphere by traveling the mandate
 isliye shivasena bijepi ke baraabar siton par chunaav ladane kii maang kar rahi he taaki zyada siten jitkar vah siem kii post par majbootee ke saath daavedaari pesh kar sake
 But Amit Shah and Fadnavis have made it clear that BJP will retain the cm's post

 The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, started four years ago by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is failing in Delhi itself

 BS Vohra, president of the RWA Federation, which runs this campaign, says that due to the garbage, the whole of Delhi is turning into hell, neither the Delhi government nor the ruling BJP in the corporation are willing to hear it

 Today, when they get out of the house every day, there is garbage in their streets and the entire colony
 is kooday kii gandagi ke kaaran vah apane bacchon ko bhi ghar se baahar nikalne nahin dete
 He believes that the dream of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can be realized only when the government along with this entire campaign should make an effective policy so that the city does not turn into garbage when the workers strike this way
 bataa den ki dilli nagar nigam ke safai karmchaaree pichley 21 din se apni maangon ko lekar ke hadtaal par hai

 On Thursday, the Delhi High Court Chief Justice Bench fiercely reprimanded the Delhi government over the issue of child labor
 court ne agali taarikh par dilli sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv, shram vibhaag ke sachiv, dilli police ke aalaa-adhikariyon samet shram vibhaag or rajasav vibhaag ke kai or aalaa-adhikario ko talab kiya he
 These officers have to come to the court and tell them that why all the child laborers they had given affidavit to get released every month are not being released
 dilli sarkaar ne court main ek states report daakhil kii jisamen unhone bataaya he ki pichley 4 saal main unhone 3770 bal mazdoor chhudaaye hai
 Questioning the status report, the petitioner NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan said that the figures given by the government
 unamem se 3517 bachche unki shikaayat par karrwai kar chhudaaye gayi hai, yani sarkaar ne apane se sirf 253 bal mazdoor hi chhudaaye hai
 The Division Bench of Chief Justice and Justice Manmohan was extremely angry with the government's arguments
 bench ne kaha ki sirf court ke nirdesh auki dakhal ke baad hi aap logon ne ab tak bal mazdoor chhudaaye hai
 Why don't you take action yourself? kya mushkil he? agali taarikh ko mukhya sachiv or duusare aalaa-adhikari khud aakar bataayenge'
 Counsel for the petitioner Bachpan Bachao Andolan argued in the court that in 2009, the Delhi High Court, in a landmark judgment, asked the government to release 500 child laborers every month in Delhi
 is hisaab se ab tak 18 hazaar bal mazdoor dilli se chhudaaye jane chaiye the jabaki sarkaar ab tak sirf 3770 bal mazdoor hi chhudaa pai he or usamen se bhi 3571 bal mazdoor unki shikaayat par chhudaaye gayi hai
 The petitioner said that he has recently submitted 17 complaints to the labor department and the police, on the basis of which 600 child laborers have been identified
 sarkaar ne 31 july ko court main kaha bhi tha ki 1 hafte main karrwai karenge lekin ab tak sirf 4 jagah hi karrwai kii gai jisamen ab tak 100 bachche chhudaaye gayi
 Significantly, this petition was filed by the Bachpan Bachao Andolan in the Delhi High Court in 2005
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee ab 13 november ko hogi
 Former Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram questioned Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's negative captaincy in the first cricket Test against Australia, but hoped that he would learn from his mistakes before the remaining matches of the four-match series
 akram ne dhoni kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki kshetrarakshan karte hue bhartiya captain ne khilaadiyon ko sahi tarah se khadaa nahin kiya or saath hi kaha ki jab emsiji par khilaadi hatotsahit the, to ve unhen prerit nahin kar paae
 He said that even after a disappointing tour of England, i had said that Dhoni is a good captain and is learning
 lekin emsiji par vah maidan par chup tha, keval kuchhek baar hi usne gendbaajon ko utsahit karne ke liye kuch shabd kahe
 i feel that motivating the bowlers by standing behind the wicket has not yet become a part of the culture of the sub-continent
 akram ne kaha, ‘mujhe dhoni kii ranneeti samaj nahin ai
 When you are getting bounce, why do you need to keep the player at deep point, why not put it on the third man
 agar aap kharaab gendbaaji kar rahe ho, to aapaki gend par shot lagenge hi

 - input bhashaa Priyanka Gandhi, who played a role in the congress-samajwadi Party alliance in UP, may contest from Rae Bareli Lok Sabha in 2019
 upi main priyanka gandhi kii bhoomika ko party ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 But the party is silent on what will be the role of Priyanka Gandhi in active politics in the future
 haalanki priyanka gandhi ko sakriy raajnneeti main dekhnaa sabhi congressi chaahate hai
 Will Priyanka Gandhi be contesting from Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat in place of Sonia Gandhi in 2019? After Priyanka Gandhi's role in the Congress and Samajwadi Party alliance in UP, this expectation has now increased
 or iske or bhi kai sanket hai
 'aaj Tak' has already reported Priyanka's contesting Lok Sabha elections from Rae Bareli instead of Sonia, when Priyanka Gandhi started taking up the complaints of the people of Rae Bareli in Delhi after Sonia Gandhi's illness
 saath hi raibareli main varisht congressi netaa ke nidhan par bhi samvednaa jataane arse se priyanka hi ja raheen hai
 There are more reasons

 If the synergy of both of you is very good, then by telling such things, bring unnecessary problems in your life
 beeti baton ko biit hi jane den or ab apni patni ke saath jivan ko bharpoor jeena shuru karen
 Do not let the past dominate yourself
 There are some pages of the past in the life of every human being in the world, which is good for forgetting and moving forward
 ho saktaa he ki aapaki puraani baton ko sunakar aapaki patni pareshaan ho jaae yaa phir dukhi ho
 Therefore, liberate yourself from all the clutches of the mind and take the initiative to bring happiness in your life by forgiving the actions of others

 yah jaan len ki aapaki patni ke man main aapaki ek alag chhavi bani hui he or aap jis baat se unhen rubaru karaane ja rahe hai, usase is chhavi ke tuutane ke saath hi uski bhaawanaaon ko bhi thes pahunchaa sakati he
 Therefore, seeing the fragility of opportunity, share the matter with them
 thodaa samay patni ko bhi deshgar aap apni baat patni ko bataa chuke hai to ab unhen thodaa samay den taaki vah us baat ko samajhen or phir koi nirnay le paane main sakasham ho
 You have got out of your mind, but your wife is in a dilemma
 isliye ab unhen bhi apni baat kehane kaa mauka avashya den
 If your relationship is made with love and understanding, then she will soon understand your point
 har parinaam ke liye rahen taiyarhar kisi ke sochane samajhane kii shakti alag hoti he isliye kisi bhi anjaam yaa parinaam ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Your wife may also want to tell you something
 apni to aap kah chuke ab unki sunne kaa samay he
 Just as your secret has surprised your wife, similarly the mystery of your wife may bother you
 lekin iske aage kii kahani aap donon kii vafadari or pyaar par nirbhar karti he
 If your relationship is tied in love then it is wise to forget everything and move on
