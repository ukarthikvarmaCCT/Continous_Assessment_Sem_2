 Here, due to the ongoing dispute in the state, the BJP high command has summoned Chief Minister Sadanand Gowda to Delhi on Monday
 iske pehle bijepi mahasachiv dharmendra pradhan, yediurppa or mukhyamantri sadanand gauda kheme ke netaaon se baatcheet karte rahe, lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 However, a third front opened up amidst this tussle, which has vowed in a way that if Gowda was removed from the post of Chief Minister, he would not support the government

 ek mahatvapurn uplabdhi ke tahat vaigyanikon ne daawa kiya he ki unhone sambhavat:aidska ilaaj khoj nikaala he
 International research teams funded by the Australian and Canadian governments claimed that they had probably discovered the genetic way the body would treat AIDS itself
 daily mail kii khabar ke anusaar, chuhon par kiye gayi anek prayogon se vaigyanikon ne yah pradarshit kiya ki pratirakshan pranali ko apane liye is kadar istemaal kiya ja saktaa he ki yah vishaanu ko niskriy kar detaa he or puri tarah se ise sharir se nikaal baahar karata he
 This achievement focuses on a chromosome called SOCS-3 that becomes highly active after being infected with an hiv-like infection and neutralizes the immune system so that the virus remains present in the body
 jab vaigyanikon ne iel-7 naamak hormone ko boost kiya to yah gunasutro niskriy ho gaya or chuuhe apane sharir se dhire dhire echivi vishaanu ko baahar nikaal sakate the
 Although there has been progress in treating the condition, the virus's ability to inactivate the immune system means that the method of treating the disease has not yet been noticed by scientists
 chuhon par kiye gayi tazatreen prayogon ke aadhaar par dal kaa maananaa he ki na keval isse aids ke ilaaj kii sambhaavna paidaa hoti he balki hipetitis bi or si tathaa tapedic jaise dderghaavadhi vaale rogon ke ilaaj kii bhi sambhaavna paidaa ho gayi he
 In all the experiments conducted to find a cure for these diseases, the immune system has to be used to get the virus or bacteria out of the body
 lekin tazatreen anusandhan se yah pradarshit hota he ki kam avadhi vaala tagada jhatka rog ke ilaaj main kahin adhik prabhavi ho saktaa he

 In his report, Deccan Chronicle quoted a source close to the Congress, writing: "dr
 Singh is in a strange situation
 film unke paksh main he lekin party ke khilaaf
 Therefore, they cannot go against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi by supporting the film
 kyonki movie par sonia-rahul kii galat chhavi pesh karne kaa aarope lag rahaa he
 "according to sources," Anupam Kher urged Nemanmohan Singh to watch the film
 lekin doctor manmohan singh ne actor ke ofer ko vinamrata ke saath thukraa diya
 "manmohan Singh's refusal to see the film made on his own is also seen as legitimate
 hai kaman ko naaraaz kar party ke khilaaf janaa manmohan singh ke liye behad mushkil he

 pichley kuch dinon main desh kii lagbhag sabhi gharelu airlines musafiron ke liye aadhi keemat main tikat ke ofer de chuki hai
 The question arises that what is the benefit of giving these offers to airlines struggling with huge losses? The aviation industry in the country is not hidden from anyone
 lekin pichhalon din jis tarah airlines ne aadhe daam main tikat baante to logon ke sawaal uthe ki aakhir aarthik tangi kaa ronaa rone vaali airlines musafiron par itani meharbaan kyon ho rahi hai
 Experts believe that this offer is a recipe to fill the seats of your airplane at the time of lean season i
e
 when less people travel by air
 jaahir he, oune paune daam par tikat bechnaa jahaaj khaali udaane se to zyada phydemand he
 Aviation expert Harshvardhan says, "it is a lean season because there are school exams and people don't travel much
 aise main in ophers se lod factor badhate hai
 'in the coming days, some new airlines have also indicated their wings in the country's market
 mana ja rahaa he ki aise main ye lubhaavne ofer philhal kaam kar rahi airlines ke market share bachaane or musafiron se khud ko jode rakhane kii tarkiben hai
 Harshvardhan says, "air Asia is about to enter the market, so this offer is an exercise to preserve its market share so that the incoming airline has difficulty and its 'gestation period' also increases
 saste tikaton ke ofer se nae yatri bhi airlines se judate hai isliye isse airlines ko paisanger base badhane kii bhi ummid rahati he

 hardik patel ne kaha he ki desh main chal rahe loksabhaa chunaavon ke paanchaven charan ke baad is desh kii janata ne tay kar liya he ki 2019 main congress kii sarkaar banani he
 That is why laughter has disappeared from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's face
 hardik patel ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki na keval congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi desh ke pradhanmantri banenge, balki is loksabhaa chunaav main congress gujarat main bhaajapa se zyada seat bhi jeetegi
 Speaking to the media in Bhopal, Hardik said, 'this time the public is with the issue, with non-violence
 main maanata hum ki rahul evam congress party par desh kii janata ne bharosa kiya he
 'he further said,' The people of this country have decided that a Congress Party government is to be formed in 2019
 isiilie paanchaven charan ke chunaav ke baad narendra modi ji ke munh par se hansi gaayab ho gai he
 'they said,' we have laughter on our mouths
 ham muskura rahe hai

 Ranbir Kapoor took the responsibility of this film's failure and said, 'when a film is successful, people give me a lot of love, so when the film fails, it is my responsibility because the audience went to the cinema houses because of me and The audience expects something from me
 ' It is worth noting that the film was in the news ever since the announcement of the film becoming Bombay Velvet
 film ko release hone tak darshakon se lekar bollywood tak is film se dher sari ummiden lagaae baithe the lekin ise logon ne hathonhaath nahin liya
 Before that, Ranbir's 2 films 'besharam' and 'roy' had flopped, so everyone felt that Ranbir would return from Bombay Velvet
 itani badi asafalata ne shaayad ranbir ko bhi chaunkaa diya hoga
 Ranbir Kapoor had high expectations from the Anurag Kashyap-directed film Bombay Velvet, but the film flopped at the box office much more than what was expected
 ranbir kapur ne is film kii asafalata kaa zimmaa uthaate hue kaha, 'jab meri koi film safal hoti he, tab log mujhe bahut pyaar dete hai isliye jab film naakaam hogi to uski zimmedaari meri hoti he kyonki darshak meri vajah se cinema gharon tak gaye or darshak mujhase kuch ummid rakhte hai
 ' gauratlab he ki film 'bombai velvet' banane kii jabase ghoshnaa hui thi tabhi se film charchaa main thi

 Such a big failure may have shocked Ranbir too

 In season 10 of 'bigg Boss', where on the one hand there is a fight between Bani and Lopa Mudra during the BB Call Center Task, the most interesting thing in this episode is that there are increasing closeness between Nitibha and Manveer
 haalanki aaj ke episod main nitibha kaul sho se baahar ho jaaengi
 Manveer got the grand finale of 'bigg Boss' Ticktanitibha and Manveer had a lot of fighting before but in the recent episode, both of them were seen to short out each other's misunderstood

 Nitibha and Manveer had grown a little closer that the breaking had occurred that now Nitibha has been thrown out
 Bigg boss 10: kya bad rahi hai manavir or nitibha main nazdikiyaan, ek hi kambal main aae najar?ek report ke mutabik nitibha kol ko aaj big bos ke ghar se baahar nikaal diya gaya he

 Neither Team India nor Indian cricket lovers were expecting this defeat
 ballebaaji main lachar pradarshan se lekar team india ke gendbaajon kaa ahm maukon par wicket na le paanaa ab uski aadat ban gaya he
 In Southampton, Team India lost the match and series by 60 runs on the fourth day itself
 saath hi ghabaraae hue mejabanenglandne siries main 3-1 kii ajey badhat banaakar raahat kii saans lee, jinhen shaayad team india se aise pradarshan kii ummid nahin hogi
 The dream of Team India was also broken, with which she came to England tour two and a half months ago
 southampton main bharat 11 saal baad england kii dharti par siries jeetne kii daud se baahar ho gaya, jiske peeche bahut galtiyaan thi
 Let's take a look at Team India's mistakes: 1
 england ke khilaae do spinner, bharat ne aswin par daalaa boj:southampton ke halaat ko dekhte hue england ke match se ek din pehle hi apni plaing ilevan ghoshit ki jisamen unhone moin ali or adil raashid ke rup main do spin gendbaajon ko shaamil kiya
 Virat Kohli missed here and held a hearty Pandyako Barkrar in Southampton
 aswin ke saath rabindra jadeja behatar vikp sabit ho sakate the
 If Jadeja had played in this match, it would have helped Ashwin a lot
 aisi sthiti main england ke moin ali ko adil raashid kaa saath mila
 Rashid did not take wickets, but apart from Moin, the pressure he put on Team India worked
 aswin ne is match main 51 over gendbaaji kii, lekin unhen sirf 3 wicket mili
 On the other hand, Moin Ali for England took 9 wickets in just 42 overs bowling in the match
 2
 Pandya proved to be the most failed all-rounder: India has been looking for an all-rounder for quite a long time
 lekin ye talash puri hi nahin ho rahi he
 Pandya is not the all-rounder India wants, as he is ineffective as a bowler and is not scoring enough runs with the bat
 pandya kii naakaami se team india kaa middle order bikhar jaataa he
 If a specialist batsman was in the team at the number at which Pandya plays, the result could have been different
 team india ke donon openar pehle hi bharat ko acchhee shuruyaat nahin de paa rahe hai, aise main pujaara, kohli or rahane ke alaava middle order puri tarah se anubhavheen hai
 Right now, Hardik Pandyabataur all-rounders are playing in the team, but if they base their performance, they do not live up to it at all
 test cricket main vah ek olerounder kii jagah nahin bhar paae
 Perhaps, there was a big difference between England and India
 kai jagah aisa laga ki shaayad hardik kii jagah ravindra jadeja behtareen chwis ho sakate the

 Sam Burden proved to be a headache for Team India at Birmingham

 out of form rahul ko baar-baar mauka:viraat kohli ne southampton main bhi out of form lokesh rahul ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Talking about Rahul's performance, this batsman scored 4 and 13 runs in the first Test of the current Test series
 nateeja team india yah match 31 ranon se ganvaa baithi
 Rahul scored 8 and 10 runs at Lord's
 nottinghamamen rahul ne 23 or 36 ran banaae or southampton main rahul ke balle se 19 or 0 ran hi nikle
 The results would have been different if the team management had shown confidence in young Hanuma Vihari and Prithvi Shaw in place of Rahul

 Mohan Rakesh, Rajkamal Choudhary, Ramesh Bakshi, Shalabh Sriram Singh and Alokdhanwa were looking for a house of their own
 yah 'ghar' ve chaahate to rahe par paa nahin sake
 The heroine of this story tells Nishita lover Abhijit that "I don't want a dream house with air walls, but a beautiful house full of emotions with brick and mortar concrete where dreams are settled
" '' nishi mahasoos karti he ki use pita kaa ghar ab ghar kyon nahin lagata kyonki pita ke ghar ko pote ke janm ke saath hi vaaris mil gaya tha isliye nishi ke man main pita ke ghar kaa ehsaas chota hota gaya or byaah ke baad pati kaa ghar use apana lagane laga
 After reading Abhi's first diary, the house takes shape in Nishi's mind
 ek kshan main vah duusari aurat ban gai
 The room that he had made 'his home' by shining so hard, became 'someone else's house' in an instant
 abhi nishi ko shaadi nibhaane kii daleel detaa he ki man main ichha karo to khadaa ho jaataa he deevaaron vaala ghar
 He tells Nishi that i want, "you get into the competition against all my girlfriends and win me over
" '' nishi ko yah gavaara to nahin lekin phir bhi vah samjhauta karti he or abhi ke paas waapas laut aati he, ek beti kii maa banati he
 Both have different theories, debate, differences, ideas, arguments
 nishi uski pehali or duusari premika ko man ke andhere tahkhaane main chhupaae pehali hone kaa naatak itani safaltaapurvak kar leti he ki logon ko hi nahin, khud use bhi yah naatak sachaai main badalata lagane lagata he
 Eventually she accepts that the father has left the house and the husband has not been able to create a house for the woman, because Nishi had found the 'house' inside himself, the house was not there
 ghar ko apane andar dhundha hoga abhi ne or ghar vahaan mila nahin hoga
 That's when he repeatedly finds love and home
 daanpaty jivan kii vidambnaa yah he ki abhi apane ateet ke saath jeena chahta he jabaki nishi chaahati he ki vah vartmaan ko jie

 Betrayed in love, the daughter advises the daughter in the story from the heart's door, whether life is mathematics or not, love is definitely the mathematics of emotions
 isi tarah 'lipstick' kahani shahari auraton kii saj-dhaj ko lekar buni gai ek acchhee kahani he
 Many stories were written in Hindi after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, but Neela's a Masjid is a parallel love story of a different kind

 This was followed by discussion on 16 January and again on 1 April

 iskaa zikr hoicourt kaa prastaav sarkaar ko milane ke baad taiyaar kii gai intelligence beuro (ibi) kii report main bhi kiya gaya he
 Advocates are well-known lawyers in corporate matters, their relationship and investment from different companies can also be a reason why this case is postponed
 vajah kuch bhi ho, chunki edwocket kaa maamla latake hue takreeban do saal ho chuke hai isliye baar ke sadsy bhi ise lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The Governor of Goa, Satya Pal Malik, has said in his first official speech that when Lord Rama was sent to exile from Ayodhya and while he was fighting Ravana to bring back Sita, someone from the upper caste The person did not help them
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki adivasee or nichali jati ke logon ne vanvaas ke dauraan bhagwaan ram kii madad kii thi
 In his speech during the second Adivasi Students' Conference on Thursday in Ponda town of South Goa, 35 km from Panaji , Malik said, "there is talk of building a grand temple for Lord Rama in Ayodhya
 ek bhavy ram mandir banaaya bhi jayega
 i listen to speeches of saints and mahants of high rank every day
 ve jab bhi apana drushtikon bataate hai, ve ramalala kii murti or ram darbar ke bare main bolte hai
 "malik (satya Pal Malik) took charge as the Governor of Goa on November 3, after which he has made a public speech for the first time
 unhone kaha, "kevat or shabari kii murti ke bare main koi nahin bolta he
 When Ram's wife and mother Sita were kidnapped, Ram's brother was the king of Ayodhya
 tab ayodhya se ek bhi sainik, ek bhi vyakti unki (ram) madad ke liye nahin aayaa tha
 When he (rama) left for Sri Lanka, he was accompanied by tribals, and only lower caste people
 kya koi mujhe bataa saktaa he ki oonchi jati ke kisi bhi vyakti ne unke saath ladaai main madad kii thi?" unhone kaha ki jab mandir nirmaan ke liye trust kaa gathan kiya jayega, tab vah mandir ke darbar haal main bhagwaan ram ke bagal main kevat or shabari kii murti sthapit karne ke liye pairvi karenge
 In the country's largest state UP, BJP has come to victory on its agenda of development as well as Hindutva

 Between the challenge of applying religious and ethnic equations, the race for the post of CM of UP seems to be at the forefront of one face of Purvanchal - Manoj Sinha

 sangh se jude jaankaar bataate hai ki manoj sinha or narendra modi donon sangh main prachaarak the or tabhi se donon kareebi rahe hai
 This is the reason that when the Modi wave came in the 2014 elections, Manoj Sinha was again removed from Ghazipur

 Making donations for Ganesh Puja Gurucharan Singh suffered heavy bullying by 5 miscreants, firing bullets in both legs of a young man imprisoned in CCTV
 aarope he ki ilaake ke kuch badmaashon ne parchi katwane gaye yuvak ke saath pehle to gaali-galouj kii or jab usne iskaa virodh kiya to bike savaar 5 badmaashon ne peedit par firing kar di
 It is being told that four shots were fired in the victim's leg
 ye puri vaardaat sisitivi main kaid ho gai he
 Thana Gandhi Nagar has registered a case
 darasal, purvi dilli ke shaahdara jile ke gandhi nagar ilaake main gurcharan singh naam kaa shaks apane ghar ke paas main hi ganesh puja kaa parchi katwane gaya tha
 It is alleged that at some distance, the crooks of the area were standing at some distance who started abusing the victim for cutting the slip
 is bich un badmaashon ne apshabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya
 The victim began to grapple with him when he protested
 iske baad ek badmaash ne pistal nikaali or pehle use daraane ke liye do goli uske saamne hawaii firing kii
 When the victim was not frightened, he shot four in both his legs
 uske baad ek hi bike par paanchon aaropee maukey se faraar ho gaye
 Meanwhile, the injured Gurucharan Singh was taken by his family members to a nearby hospital
 philhal thana gandhi nagar ne is babat maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar diya he
 Police say that investigation is being done on every aspect of the case, but this case once again questions the law and order in the area
 kaale dhan ke khilaaf apane andolan ke dauraan bhale hi june ke maheene main dilli police ne baba ramdev or unke samarthakon ko dilli se baahar khaded diya ho, lekin gerua vastradhari sanyasi ne bharat swabhimaan yatra ko phir shuru kar sarkaar ke khilaaf bigul phoonk diya he
 a month after Rani Laxmibai's yatra started from Jhansi to Etawah, Baba constantly tried to convey his status to the Congress
 yatra ko uttar pradesh ke kasbon main mili vyapak samarthan ke baad baba aage kya mansuba paal rahe hai or sakriy raajnneeti ke prati unka najariya kaise badal rahaa he, is bare main baba ramdev ne india today ke pramukh samvaadadaata piyush babele se bebaaki se baatcheet kii
 Despite all the investigations by the government on the Ramlila Maidan incident and the people and institutions associated with you, your crowd is gathering in your meetings? What is the thing that keeps the charisma of Baba intact? We did not connect people with our dreams or by giving assurance
 hamane pramanikta ke saath aarogy diya
 Presented evidence of black money on the issue of corruption, no real casserole cooked
 vahiin, rajasatta ne logon ko vikaas ke jhuthe sapane dikhaae
 The Congress government played a vandalism role in our movement
 ek sanyasi kii hatya kaa prayaas hua
 Rajbala was assassinated by the central government
 aaj congress kii vishwasaneeyata nunatam str par aa gai he
 The sins of the Congress will put an end to it
 log sachaai jaan rahe hai or pehle se dedh guna log mere kaaryakramon main aa rahe hai
 How will your visit affect the forthcoming assembly elections? We have taken three issues before the people - bring back black money, eradicate corruption and change the system
 jo pratyaashee yaa party in teenon muddon par likhit samarthan degi use hamaara samarthan hoga
 Till now, apart from Congress, other parties are talking about our demands, that is why i have opposed Congress so far in the yatra
 lekin congress kaa bhi koi pratyaashee in muddon par hamaare saath he to use bhi samarthan hoga
 Our workers will call the candidates on an open platform in every assembly constituency in five states and take their opinion in front of the public
 khule manch par hone vaale in kaaryakramon main main khud bhi maujuud rahoonga
 But did Team Anna take all the credit for the Congress' defeat in Hisar Lok Sabha elections? Do you have differences with Anna movement? In Hisar, a month before the election, 1,000 of our activists were active
 ek lakh logon se hamaare kaaryakartaaon ne sidhe sampark kiya or congress ke paap saamne laane ke liye parche baante
 The public beat the Congress badly according to that
 vaise bhi main aanshik taur par pichley 20 saal se or purna rup se paanch varsh se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahaa hum
 Where did it come to take credit for it? But what to compare, i respect Anna ji very much, he is a different kind of man, he has come from social movement
 ab jaise ramlila maidan (anna andolan main) main jitne log ikattha hue the utane log to roj mere paas aate hai
 Now suppose Arvind Kejriwal is meeting, how many people are coming to him
 utane log to meraa swaagat karne aate hai
 i have held meetings of 10 crore people
 bharat swabhimaan kaa andolan desh ke 640 jilon main failaa he
 It is not fair to compare any movement to this movement
 hamane bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan ko pehle hi ek str tak pahunchaa diya tha or jab anna ji aae to maine bhi antim samay main shaamil hokar unhen sahyog diya
 As far as differences are concerned, Lokpal alone cannot remove corruption
 lokapal bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii disha main pehla kadam he
 The rest of the laws and the system will also have to be strengthened, only then the matter will be made
 aapane kejariwal kaa zikr kiya, unhone ek bayaan main kaha ki unka andolan left of di centre he, jabaki baba kaa andolan rhite of di centre he
 Any comments on this
 haa, main dakshinpanthi hum
 i am a spiritual person, i am not a person with leftist leanings to run the movement with foreign money and rewards
 mujhe samaj nahin aata ki artiai main kaam karne vaali sansthaaon ko videshon kaa sahyog kyon miltaa he
 i have nothing more to say
 jab aapke paas 10 karod logon kaa samarthan he, to khulkar raajnneeti main aane se hichak kisi?loktantr main raajnneeti ek lambii prakriya he, aise main jo log lambey samay se raajnneeti main kaam kar rahe hai, unhen ek or mauka dena chahta hum
 If our demands are not met, then we can present a name for a strong Prime Minister before the next Lok Sabha elections, as no major change can happen in the country unless the Chief is strong
 baat chaahe desh kii ho yaa pradesh kii or log bhi yahi chaahate hai
 In the next Lok Sabha election, we will present the Prime Ministerial candidate on our behalf
 us vyakti kaa puraa trek record janata ke saamne hoga
 But the post of Prime Minister is not like the post of President where a name is proposed
 use aap bahumat dal kaa netaa kaise banavaayenge? vaise aapke man main kiskaa naam he?mere dimag main 4-6 naam hai
 But i will not disclose them now
 haa vah naam majboot hoga, eemaandaar hoga or janata use pasand karegi
 As far as his election is concerned, a big strategy is being made for it, at the time of election, we will see how many parties support him, how much will the public support
 ye bahut bada mudda hoga
 But at the moment i am silent in the name of someone
 lekin aap ye maan lijie ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bahut bada andolan hoga
 What is your opinion about Rahul Gandhi becoming Prime Minister? If he agrees with us on three issues of black money, corruption and system change, then his dream of becoming Prime Minister can be fulfilled
 ham ek baar unako phir se prapoj kar rahe hai, antim baar
 i also met him last year and i asked him to clarify his stand on these three issues with authenticity
 aapako likhakar bhi dena hoga or janata ke saamne apni niyat saaf kerani padegi
 Now they have this last chance
 aapane subah kaha ki mandi ke khilaaf 80 deshon main ho rahe andolan se bada andolan aap desh main khadaa karenge? ye kis tarah kaa andolan hoga
 Many countries of the world are on the verge of bankruptcy
 america jaisi mahashakti ke haal kharaab hai
 If black money does not come back in India, then the condition of the economy here will also deteriorate
 sarkaar ko galat aarthik nitiyon se chetane ke liye desh main andolan kii sakht jarurat he
 Partially, the agitation will stand before the assembly elections of five states and largely before the Lok Sabha elections, because the country forgets how big the movement is before it
 ye mana jaae ki kaledhan ke khilaaf andolan antarrashtriya shakl le rahaa he?hamen jo dastavej mili hai uske mutabik america duniya kaa sabase bada tex haven ban gaya he
 Countries like Switzerland are nothing in front of him
 duusari taraf america khud 1,000 lakh karod dollar ke karrj main duba he, phir bhi duniya kii mahashakti bana hua he
 My aim is to make India a world superpower, for this i am willing to devote my whole life
 iske liye kisi kaa bhi virodh karnaa pade or koi bhi parinaam jhelana pade main taiyaar hum
 Despite this opposition, i would say that the right to protest democratically in America is better than India
 britain main bhi halaat behatar hai
 We have kept democracy in power
 isse zyada sharmnaak kya hoga
 Recently, director Apoorva Lakhia's film 'hasina Parkar' was released
 ye film bharat ke most wonted anderworld don daaud ibrahim kii bahan hasina parkar ke jivan par aadhaarit he

 According to a local shopkeeper, Hasina Apa helped her to bring back her runaway sister
 is kaam ko karne ke liye hasina ne khud phone kiya tha
 Hasina was famous for her slum business, extortion for films and bargaining rights for release abroad, hawala racket, cable operators' business and extortion, but still Aaj Tak has only one FIR against Hasina

 a complaint was also registered against Hasina in the same case
 daaud apni bahan ke is bijness se khush nahin tha
 Dawood also denied Hasina for this, but Hasina did not listen
 hasina property ke masale bhi sulajhane lageen
 For this she used to take heavy commission
 janaaje main umade the hajaaron logaossain jaidi ko die ek intervyuu main hasina ne kaha tha ki unka bhai daaud bura he lekin itnaa bhi nahin jitna use bana diya gaya he
 According to Hasina, there were many false cases against Dawood

 com / ycclyq7tci — Syed Akbaruddin (@akbaruddinindia) November 20, 2017 Syed Akbaruddin, India's permanent representative to the United Nations, also tweeted congratulations on Bhandari's victory
 unhone likhaa ki 'ek vot jo behisaab khushi lekar aayaa he, bharat kii ore se justise dalvir bhandari dobaaraa isije ke jaj chune gaye hai' BS Yeddyurappa, former Karnataka Chief Minister and current state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), got into a new controversy when he appeared in a video giving some currency notes to a woman
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah video shuukravaar ko mysore ke paas gundulpet vidhansabha kshetra ke vadra hosahalli gaanv main record kiya gaya tha
 The amount that appears in the video is an aid amount of Rs 1 lakh and the woman to whom BS Yeddyurappa is giving this money is the wife of a farmer who recently committed suicide due to debt burden
 kaha ja rahaa he ki pehle yediurppa ne yah rakam purv mantri renukacharya ko isi mahila ko dene ke liye thamai thi, lekin jab mahila unhen dekhakar rone lagi, to yediurppa ne rakam ko renukacharya se lekar khud mahila ko saunp diya
 The comments vivaad kii vajah yah he ki gundulpet vidhansabha kshetra ke saath-saath nanjungarh main bhi ravivaar ko hi vidhansabha upachunaav ke liye matdaan hona he
 Thus, other political parties have objected to this amount given just 48 hours before voting, and they say that it is a matter of violation of the model code of conduct directly implemented by the Election Commission
 haalanki ab tak is maamle main bijepi yaa congress kii taraf se aadhikarik taur par koi bayaan jari nahin kiya gaya he
 It is being told that this video was recorded in Vadra Hosahalli village of Gundulpet assembly constituency near Mysore on Friday
 jo rakam video main dikhaai de rahi he, ek lakh rupee kii sahaayta raashi he or jis mahila ko bies yediurppa yah rakam de rahe hai, vah us kisaan kii patni he, jisane haal hi main karz ke boj kii vajah se khudakushi kar lee thi
 It is being said that earlier Yeddyurappa had given this amount to former minister Renukacharya to give to this woman, but when the woman started crying after seeing him, Yeddyurappa handed over the money from Renukacharya to the woman herself
 tippaniyan The reason for the controversy is that in Gundulpet assembly constituency as well as Nanjungarh, there is going to be a vote for the assembly by-election on Sunday itself
 so, voting se sirf 48 ghante pehle di gai is rakam par anya raajnneetik dalon ko aapatti he, or unka kahana he ki yah sidhe taur par chunaav ayog dwaara lagu kii gai adarsh aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa maamla he
 However, till now no statement has been officially issued by either the BJP or the Congress

 kitab-balagandharva - Looking for a myth of modern Marathi theater writer-abhiram Bhadkamkarhindi translation-gorakh thoratamulya-rs
399 a Hindi translation of Balagandharva, a popular book written in Marathi, will be available to readers from today
 ise abhiram bhadkamkar ne likhaa he, jiskaa hindi anuwaad gorakh thoraat ne kiya he
 It is a novel published by Rajkamal Prakashan
 upanyaas kii katha narayan shripad rajhans ke jivan par aadhaarit he
 On hearing Shripad Rajhans singing at a very young stage, Lokmanya Tilak conferred him with the title of Balagandharva
 baad main shripad isi naam se duniyabar main vikhyath hue
 Let's read an excerpt from this book
 
 
 gandharva ke bhaashanon kaa jor utar gaya tha
 The drama shows were on
 karj kii rakam sattar hajaar ke kareeb pahunch chuki thi
 The films had captured the audience
 raat ke sho main darshak nadaarad or bahari gaanvon main kharch ghataakar haath aanevaali aamadani bilkul hi naganya
 
 
 Now something has to be done to run the house and the company, in the same turbulence, Gandharvas were pushing every single day
 isi darmiyaan ek yuvati cinema ke mayajaal main funskar apane praanon kii baaji lagaae cinema main jaden jamaane kaa prayaas kar rahi thi
 This girl was from Bilgi village, located thirty miles away from Bijapur
 naam, gauhar
 The city of dreams, Mumbai
 yahaan kaam karne kii tamanna rakhanevaala koi bhi shaks kabhi bhookha nahin sota
 Due to this, the number of people coming here to fill their stomachs is immense
 lekin gauhar keval pet bharne ke liye mumbai nahin aa rahi thi
 For him, the dream was more than a stomach fire
 use rup-rang dete samay allaah ne kanjusee jarur barti thi, lekin kanth kamaal kaa surila diya tha
 The dark character also had a glow
 deh sudaul, tanik mardaana chata
 There was something in her to control the man, which she knew very well
 sapanom kii gathree seene se lagaae vah mumbai pahunchi
 Mumbai, an everlasting life in Bhagadoudi and in its own tune
 chamchamati battiyaan, shorgul se bhare hotel, sadakon par chakachaundh, deeyon kaa ujaalaa
 
 
 Incense outside some cafe
 
 
 apane beongepan main bhi amiri kii shekhi baghaarti mumbai! parantu gauhar ne jab kadam rakhaa, tab puri tarah se dahak rahi thi
 There was scorching hindu-muslim riots
 chhili ja rahi thi
 Gauhar stepped into Mumbai in a terrible atmosphere
 mumbai ke boribandar stesan par gauhar kaa swaagat kiya isi barbar maahaul ne
 Book review: Police patrols continued outside the document station of select generals
 chaaron ore dar or sandeh kaa maahaul
 
 
 'oh God! Ah came out of his mouth
 gauhar ke saath kaaka desai naamak ek bujurg the
 He held his arm tightly
 ''gauhar, vaapis laut chalo
 They will not know when and where death will be caught, they said in a trembling voice
 tabhi ek swayamsevak saamne aayaa
 He asked everyone to go towards one of the doors of the station
 gauhar soch main pad gai
 Go out or return from the train you got from the station now? But if the dream takes over the mind, then the eyes cannot see anything else
 usne ek pal sochaa or vah swayamsevak ke dikhaae daravaaje kii taraf chal padi
 Kaka Desai also started flailing after him
 swayamsevakon ne aanevaale yatriyon ke rele ke saath gauhar ko bhi ek dharmashala main bhej diya
 Gauhar came to Dharamshala
 baahar log apana aapa kho baithe the
 Satan was on their hearts and minds
 swayamsevakon ne use ek kamare main saamaan rakhane ko kaha
 Kaka Desai went out to make the next arrangement
 gauhar ne dharmashala ke us kamare kaa darwaja band kiya
 The room decoration in the Gujarati Dharamshala was also Gujjar style
 nakkashi, rang, sab gujarati
 But Mumbai was colored by vandalism
 aadmi ko aadmi se hi dar lagane laga tha
 Gauhar sat down silently
 bijapur, bilgi peeche chhot chukaa tha
 Uncertain all ahead
 bas sahaara tha apane sureele kanth kaa or usamen basii huin alag-alag chizon, raag-raaginiyon kaa
 He closed the window, laid the mat and covered the forehead and started offering Namaz
 kuch der ke liye khud ko us saare maahaul se alag kar vah allaah kii sharan main chali gai
 The restlessness of his life subsided a little, but there was still a bang in his chest
 vah khamosh baithi rahi
 He closed his eyes and remembered his Abbasan Hussain Khan
 table par khan sahab kaa haath aisa chalata, maano haathon main bijli utar aayi ho
 Hussain Khan's drama company used to do shows in Karnataka area
 nanhee-si gauhar nepathy se naatak dekha karti
 Abbajan recognized only then that his love would turn to the princess drama
 unhone tabhi se uske man main ucchakanksha ke beej bona shuru kiya tha
 'son, Allah has given you the skill to sing, do not waste it in the stove
 gauhar ko rasoi se uthaakar ve hormonium ke paas bithaate
 Then more than one thing would come out of the neck of Gauhar and Ameerbai like a waterfall
 yun to donon bahanon kii awaajon kii fitrat alag
 But Gauhar Kali started singing in five white sevens
 gaate-gaate hi vah jaan gai ki ab yahi meri jindagi he
 Just keep singing, and this madness brought her to Mumbai
 chaahe jo ho, ab waapas nahin janaa
 The outside attack was not diverting from the mind
 bheetar khalabali machi hui thi
 He raised the tentacles straight away and separated from the whole world and applied 'sa'
 
 
 
 Gave himself over that 'sa' and automatically broke an alarm from his heart and spoke out of his throat
 
 
 'prabhu aji gamalaa mani toshala’pustak samiksha: chupade kii chudilenkaphi der tak vah gaati rahi
 
 
 And while singing, the form of Gandharva was realized in front of him
 
 
 or bilkul unheen kii style main vah pad aage badhane laga
 This always happens
 gauhar ke kanth par ammi, abbajaan or anya guruon kii bajaay gandharva kii gayaki chadhi thi
 Exactly gandharva ke record sunne main vah ghanton khoi rahati
 She tries to sing like him
 yadhyapi uski aawaaj kii fitrat alag thi, phir bhi usne gandharva kii gayaki ko apane kanth main hoobahoo basaa liya tha
 He was not bothered or worried about what was happening outside
 vah gaati hi rahi
 He kept remembering Gandharva while singing
 uski bechaini thamati gai
 It is as if God has found him
 vah gaati rahi
 Several hours
 
 
 
 And then after midnight there was a knock at his door
 usne tanpura alag kiya
 Kaka Desai was standing in the doorway
 haathon main kuch bhojan kii saamagree
 
 
 
 'kya huwa ji? wo mili?' sur ko lambaa khinchakar usne apane karnatakai lahaze main poocha
 'yes, met Chapekar
 aashcharya hua unhen, aap mumbai ain yah sunakar
 They have called there yesterday itself
 'gauhar ne raahat kii saans lee
 It is good to know that the Chapekar whom she has come to Mumbai to trust has welcomed
 'aane ko bolaa unhone?''haan, par
 
 
 "now Kayku ji on this
 
 
 ' usne poocha
 'it has given
 ' kaaka desai ne ek thili aage badhaai
 'he is asked to come wearing this
 ' thili main haath daalkar usne vastuen baahar nikaalin or chaunk gai
 The bag contained bangles, a talisman of a deity and a shrine of Sindoor
 've bole, hinduon kii basti he, kuch hua to
 
 
 She was shocked for a moment
 kya karen? uske liye yah anpekshit tha
 But he decided man main kuch sochaa
 'no religion is bigger than dreams
 ' darpan ke saamne jaakar usne sindur kii pudiya kholi or maathe par bada-sa tikaa lagaaya
 We wore bangles in my hands, hung a talisman of the deity around my neck and stood in front of the mirror
 use khud kaa ek anokhaa rup dikhaai diya
 Now there was no obstacle in his path
 na vah danga, na koi dar or na koi majahab
 
 
 What will be the destination, where will it be, God knows
 
 
 ham to chal pade hai
 
 
 
 usne pallu sir par rakhaa or ek or paatr maano sajkar taiyaar ho gaya
 To make his farce
 
 
 
 All the boys now started eagerly listening to Gauhar's entry
 uske bare main faili afvaahen, baaten unke sunne main ai thim
 Because of this, only a halo was made towards him
 sanat ko to entry main hi bha gai vah
 Gauhar decorating the forehead, seeking the warmth of love in the singing of Gandharva
 aadmi itnaa iktarafa pyaar kar saktaa he?sar bol rahe the, 'bhaaiyo, ek chatur naatakkaar naatak ke ek vaakya main kai arth bhar detaa he
 Each action of the character conveys many meanings and sometimes in a context also informs the upcoming event
 abhi ghatit hua prasang isi vakt kyon tha, iskaa uttar kuch prasangon ke baad, kabhi-kabhi to aakhri ank main mil paata he or tab samaj main aata he ki aagaamee ghatana kii soochna dene ke liye naatakkaar ne kitni chaturaai se us prasang kii yojana banaai thi
 a plan to decorate vermilion on Gauhar's forehead as soon as he arrives in Mumbai
 iske peeche uuparavaale naatakkaar kaa kuch aagaamee ghatnaon kii ore sanket to nahin tha? lekin asli naatak or jindagi kaa naatak, donon main yahi fark hota he
 In the play, Nat knows what is going to happen next
 nat jaanata he ki uske hisse main ai bhoomika kaa ant kahan he, kaisaa he
 But in the drama of life, no one knows what has been written in his role
 apane hisse ai bhoomika ko nibhaana, bas yahi uske bas main hota he
 Do we really do what we do? Or is it someone else who is the subject? The whole drama ends in this confusion
 gadakari guruji kehete hai, apane hisse aayaa swaang rachaana chahie
 Something similar
 baharhaal, us upar baithe naatakkaar ne gandharva kii jindagi main ek nayaa swaang bhej diya tha
 Gauhar gauhar us upar baithe naatakkaar ke likhit aadesh ke anusaar golpeetha ke paas kii badrikashram chaal kii taraf chal di
 'there was a stir for the arrival of men outside and the pigeon wings of the Badrikashram gait flew away
 gauhar ko unke pankhons par mumbai kaa matamaila rang chadha hua najar aayaa
 Kaka Desai went inside with him in his chawl
 darwaja khatkhataya
 Chapekar opened the door and saw what? Gauhar in front
 saanwale rang par khili sari, haathon main chudiyaan or maathe par kuleen stri kii tarah bada-sa sindur
 Her Noor was as if a married woman had come from her maternal in-laws
 daravaaje se hatakar usne gauhar ko bheetar aane diya
 Gauhar went inside
 uski maadak deh kii gatividhiyaan chapekar ne darj kin
 Girl came to Mumbai as promised! Introduced into Bilgi, later her attempt to enter Chapekar Company, then the idea of trying luck in cinema
 chapekar ne sari baton kaa puraa samarthan kiya tha
 He felt special belonging and trust towards Chapekar
 usne use baithne ko kaha
 She spoke openly
 dil kholkar bolti rahi
 Connoisseurs of Chapekar recognized, the girl will flag in Mumbai cinema
 chapekar natyadarsh sangeet naatak mandali kaa sansthaapak tha
 Pagliayi Gauhar was going to benefit from his acquaintance to come to Kalakshetra
 gauhar ne sachmuch man lagaakar cinema ke liye prayaas shuru kiye
 Actually, Chapekar was visionary
 vah jaanata tha ki aisi ladakiyon kii is dhandhe main kya dasha ho jaati he
 So he decided to move with discretion
 usne gauhar ko sab samajha diya
 In cinema, the heroine has to sing her own songs
 isliye cinemaavaalon ko gaanevaali sundar ladakiyon kii talash rahati he
 Gauhar will not go round the makers' doors
 pehle uski aawaaj or naam pahunchega unke kaanon tak
 Then he himself would come and urge her for cinema
 iske liye usne gauhar ko radio par gavaane kii yojana banaai
 Sitting in that chawl room, Gauhar came to know that the journey is difficult, but if the right steps are taken then there is nothing difficult
 chapekar kaa ek mitra dattopant phatak ek ardhasarkari radio main tha
 Chapekar immediately caught him and insisted that once, just once, he heard Gauhar's voice
 gauhar ko gane kaa test dene ke liye radio se bulaava aayaa
 First examination in Mumbai
 aaj tak hajaaron darshakon ke saamne gane kii aadi gauhar
 But today there was a pressure on him
 use dur hataate hue vah taiyaar ho gai
 Chapekar looked on, wearing a chandrakala saree and makeup on her face
 daaman aisa odha hua ki dekhanewaalon ko uske uroj saaf-saaf najar aaen
 Along with singing, he realized his proficiency in this art and was relieved
 gauhar ne gaanaa gaaya
 Chapekar, sitting on the other side of the glass, was also visible
 gaate samay gauhar ke onth maadakta se hill rahe the
 Along with Shravan, his song was also becoming visible
 gaanaa or gauhar, donon sabhi ko pasand aae or vah radio se anubandh-patr lekar hi lauti
 Gauhar started singing on the radio
 radio star ban gai or dhire-dhire uski aawaaj ek pahchaan ban gai
 Then the attention of cinema companies started coming to him and Sharda Sinetone owner Mayashankar Thakkar sent his manager Babubhai to Gauhar
 cinema company kaa manager milane aa rahaa he, is khabar se vah pagal-si ho gai
 Also watchful
 usne chaturaai se yojana banaai
 The manager came, got acquainted
 gauhar boli, 'babubhai, riyaj kaa vakt he
 You sit down a little late
 ' usne hormonium nikaala or usee ke saamne riyaj shuru kiya
 Babubhai started listening to the song
 parantu gauhar jaan gai ki uski najar uski sughad deh par phisal rahi he
 Now how long will he slip? Singing, he raised an eyebrow and jerked the body
 babubhai jaan gaya, uskaa sara dhyaan gauhar kii us kamaneey deh main hi atka hua he
 He accepted all the terms of Gauhar
 gauhar kaa diya paan kaa bidaa usee ke haath se othon main dabaaya or chalaa gaya
 Gauhar also came to know that his steps have stagnated in his mind a hundred times while leaving
 babubhai baar-baar aata rahaa
 Gauhar shines as heroine and singer in Rasada Vilas of Sharda Sinetone
 yadhyapi cinema kaa nayak krishnarav chonkar tha, par gauhar kii jindagi kaa nayak babubhai hi ban gaya
 Gauhar would say and he would have brought the money
 vah aise aata jaise usase bandh gaya ho
 The works of companies such as Navbharat, Jayabharat, Jayadev Sinetone, Indian Liberty Pictures came to Gauhar
 babubhai kii seedhi uske liye bahut phydemand sabit hui
 Babubhai Gauhar had become obsessed
 usne company kaa paisa usee par lutaanaa shuru kiya
 At the expense of the company, Gauhar's house started being built in Bilgi and in this the company got a shock of fifteen-twenty thousand
 isaki aahat mayashankar ko lagi or babubhai ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya gaya
 Gauhar got the desired destination by making Babubhai's ladder
 usne badi chaturaai se yah seedhi phenk di
 Chapekar also came to know that Gauhar specializes in the art of trapping a man in his grip, but not in himself
 ab use babubhai se bhi badi seedhi kii talash thi
 Chapekar then got him to meet Vyasa Saheb, the manager of Columbia Company
 deh kaa hathiyaar banane main maahir gauhar ne vyas ko bhi apana bana liya
 Gauhar's salary increased
 ab use saat sau rupye milane lage
 He settled his home on Grant Road
 ab chapekar uske paas rahane laga
 Gauhar did not leave her, as the whole world was crazy behind films, but Gauhar was drawn to plays
 chapekar ke saannnidhya main gauhar kii naatakon main dilchaspee or bad gai or gandharva naamak chamatkaar kaa nasha or gaharaa hota gaya
 Gauhar would have blossomed if Gandharva had pretended
 chapekar ne bhi stri-bhoomikaaye kii thim
 Gandharva had influence on that too
 isliye gauhar ne usase hi gandharva ke pad siikhe
 Chapekar seemed to be a puzzle
 ek taraf apni deh-smapda kaa puraa ehsaas
 Like pawns, where and how to use it, how to display it in front of anyone, its inherent knowledge and on the other hand, listening to the name of Gandharva emerges on the face
 donon ke bich koi talmail nahin tha
 Is Gauhar okay? Opportunistic? smart? Or Meera, who forgets herself while singing and singing like Gandharva's footsteps, Gauhar found films, got work, but slowly realized that it would not last long
 gauhar ke naam ne tikat khidki par koi jaadu nahin kiya
 She could not become the heartbeat of the audience
 use anumaan ho rahaa tha ki yahan jaden jamaana mushkil he
 And one day, Gauhar, who was going to watch the play, kept dressing for a long time
 dharau poshaak, vyas kaa diya khaas videshi itr, gandharva jaisi keshasaja
 
 
 
 'aaj koi khaas baat?' chapekar ne poocha
 "today i will return only after seeing him!" "whose?" Gauhar took his hand to the heart
 'unke, balgandharva ke
 
 
 
 ' or uthi
 Chapparkar understood that if he is determined, he will return only after meeting him
 nirmaataaon se milane jate samay kitni hi baar vah darpan main khud ko niharti
 He saw a hunter in his eyes
 aatmavishvaas se las gauhar sari yojana thik se banaati
 Goes, and returns only after completing the hunt
 naatak shuru hone main abhi samay tha
 Gandharvas were in the costum room inside
 bagal main lalji khadey
 Sense of compulsion on Gandharva's face sitting in front of mirror
 chaaron ore se bad rahe kharch or aamadani kii raahen sankeern
 Lalji was understanding everything
 gandharva kii chatapataahat, unka natyaprem
 Lalji gestured to the clerk standing nearby
 usne apni chamade kii thili kholi
 Removed fifty thousand rupees notes from it
 lalji ne gandharva ko dene ke liye note aae badaye
 But Gandharva was silent
 'naanaa
 
 
 'he looked towards Gandharva
 unki ankhon main anunay tha
 Gandharva took notes in his hand without saying anything and gave it to Bapurao
 lalji uthe or haath jodate hue bole, 'naanaa, karachi main milenge
 'and walked out
 ve gandharva kii mudra, unki aankhon kii khinnata dekhnaa nahin chaahate the
 Gauhar reached the auditorium
 phir usne sidhe rangabhusha kaksh kii raah pakadi
 Gundesha stood outside
 'gandharva maharaj se milanaa he
 ' he said
 gundesha bheetar gaya
 Gauhar had an untold uneasiness in his mind
 bachapan se jis gandharva ke gane sunati ai hoon, jisaki gayaki ke ujaale main sangeet kii aradhana kii he; vahi gandharva—swayan gandharva se mulaakaat hogi!kya kahuungi? kya puuchhuungi? pair pakaduun yaa
 
 
 Should i keep the pallu on the head? 
 
 gauhar pasopesh main pad gai
 Gundesha came out
 usne kadam aage badhaayaa
 'they will not meet
 naatak ke samay ve kisi se nahin milte,' gundesha bolaa or bheetar chalaa gaya
 Gauhar stood like that for a few moments
 nahin milenge? use laga ab uski rulaai chhutegi
 Still explaining to herself she sat down to watch the play
 gandharva ne pravesh kiya
 She kept looking at them, losing sudha-mercury
 unka gayan, unka dikhnaa, unka bolnaa
 
 
 
 gauhar ko lagata rahaa, maano puure prekshagaar main keval ve donon hai or gandharva keval uske liye hai
 There was a decency in the conduct of the Gandharvas
 khadey rahanaa bhi kaisaa? apni pratishtha or samnevaale kaa lihaaj! usne sochaa, inase aadhi najaakat bhi mujhamen hoti, to bhi pagal bana detii main darshakon ko
 She was deeply moved by his exaltation
 naatak khatm hua
 People started returning
 gauhar daudti hui rangabhusha kaksh kii taraf gai or kaksh ke baahar gandharva kii pratiksha karne lagi
 The Gandharvas kept removing their costumes for a long time
 unhone wig utaara
 Ignored the scalping hair and came out
 gauhar unki taraf dekhati hui saamne ai
 But they did not even look at him
 ek stri or vah bhi ek filmi duniya kii nati saamne pratiksha main khadi he
 But Gandharva went ahead by tapping him
 gauhar niraash nahin hui, gussa bhi nahin hui
 What happened if i did not meet? Visited use is baat kaa bhi santosh tha
 She kept watching them till she lost her eyes
 
 
 
 Gauhar returned, but in a different fun
 chapekar ko uske bartaav se laga, shaayad gandharva se mulaakaat ho gai
 He asked, "kya bola nana?" "didn't meet, but looked
" kareeb se dekha unhen
 Thank God ' vah hawa main tairti-si bheetar chali gai
 He kept on looking at it film jagat main jahaan mauka mili, vahaan raasakrida rachaanevaali gauhar gandharva ke maamle main mira kii tarah samarpit kaise ho jaati he? chapekar ke liye yah ek paheli thi
 Gauhar kept watching Gandharva's plays in the hope that he would meet Gandharva sometime
 gandharva ke bhaashanon kaa fever utar gaya or naatakon kaa manchan dubaara shuru hua
 But the loan amount had increased to close to seventy thousand
 lalji dwaara die paise kaise aae or kahan gaye, pataa bhi nahin chalaa
 Audience missing in the night staging
 bahari gaanvon ke dauron main kharch ghataakar haath aanevaali aamadani bahut hi naganya
 Now something must be done to run a house and a company! While traveling, the company reached Yevla
 yevala main naatak shuru hona tha
 Gandharva was waiting in the background to open the curtain
 kaaphi der hui, phir bhi paradaa khulne ke chihn nahin
 everything is changing
 unke man main baat ubhari
 Artists take so long to prepare, not a good thing! Haribhau was in the background
 'haribhaau, kalakaaron se kahie, samay par taiyaar ho jaaen
 '' Artists are ready Nana
 ' haribhaau gardan jhukaae hue bole, ''lekin
 
 
 
 ''lekin kya?''lekin, darshak hi nahin hai
 Just six people have arrived
 'gandharva ke bheetar kuch hill uthaa
 Only six people? He was not feeling anything
 'naanaa, sho radd karen?'gandharva ne paas ke khambhe kaa sahaara liya
 Then someone came
 'naanaa, puja karen?'sabhi taiyaar the
 Curtain, dress
 
 
 kalakaar, vadak
 
 
 But the one to be worshiped was the God who was angry
 'nahin, sho radd nahin karenge
 There will be drama
 bajietisari ghanti
 'bell bell maahaul dhoop se gamgama uthaa
 The curtain opened and just a small applause was found
 gandharva rangamanch par aae
 Tan Li and looked in front
 puraa prekshagrih khaali garbhagrih kii tarah jaan padaa unhen
 
 
 Aristocratic literature
 
 
 bakhale bova, master krishnarav kaa sangeet
 
 
 Our hard work
 
 
 yah manchasajja, yah netrasukhad nirmaan
 
 
 Still the audience going there? To those pointless, lifeless pictures? If so, for whom should we do all this? For whom should this yagya be performed? Why were we rejected? Do not understand anything bhagwan, kya khatm ho gai meri bhoomika? khatm ho gaya naatak? kya kala bhi manushya kii tarah marati he? naatak mar rahaa he or ham yun hi baithe hai uske sirahaane-paitaane juthi aashaa main
 Lucky were Bhaurao, Keshavrao, Deval Guruji
 
 
 
 Gandharva on the stage was showing the illusion of Bamini to the audience and his mind was angry inside
 gadakari guruji, irshyaa hoti he aapse, irshyaa! natyakala ko is tarah fatty-puraani utaran main dekhne kii naubat nahin aayi aap logon par
 
 
 
 manchan khatm hua
 It was happening in the morning
 
 
 par gandharva jaan chuke the, ab subah nahin hogi
 On the administration and law and order front, now the UP government is preparing for major changes
 sutron ke anusaar alok kumaar ko nayaa grih sachiv sachiv banaaya ja saktaa he, jabaki shashi prakaash goyal siem yogi ke nae pramukh sachiv ho sakate hai
 According to sources, Devashish Panda will be Resident Commissioner in Delhi
 madhyamik shiksha vibhaag main pies iees jintender kumaar ko unke pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Significantly, Yogi Adityanath was given the command of the largest state in the country after winning a huge majority in UP
 unase pradesh kii janata ko kaaphi ummiden hai or unhone aate hi tamaam ection bhi liye
 But gradually the state again returned to its pattern and law and order situation started deteriorating
 unhen shapath liye kareeb 2 maheene ho gaye, lekin apradhi abhi bhi belgaum hai
 Incidents of robbery, murder and rape are taking place every day
 yogi adityanath ne soobe kii kaman sanbhaalane ke saath hi ye sandesh diya tha ki kanoon-vyavastha banaae rakhana unki pramukhataa rahegi
 In view of this, several important changes were made in the Uttar Pradesh Police as soon as Yogi Adityanath became the Chief Minister
 nae dijipi kii niyukti kii gai
 The police were instructed to act with ease
 mahilaon kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhkar anti romeo team banaai gai
 The Yogi government also transferred administrative officers on a large scale
 ab phir se pramukh padon par badlaav kar yogi sarkaar shashan kii chulein kasnaa chaahati he
 The Badaun Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh is considered to be the stronghold of the Samajwadi Party
 samaajawaadee party ne 2019 main phir se saansad dharmendra yadav ko chunaav maidan main utaara he, lekin is baar bijepi ne yahaan apni puri taak jhonk di he
 BJP has sent Sanghamitra Maurya, daughter of Cabinet Minister Swami Prasad Maurya, to the election battle of Badaun
 bataa den ki 2014 main modi lahar main bhi dharmendra yadav bade antar se jeet darj kii thi
 He defeated the BJP candidate by 1,66,347 votes
 modi lahar main bhaajapa ke vageesh pathak ko 3,32,031 vot mili the
 The Congress indirectly supported the SP in this election, although this time the Congress has given ticket to Salim Sherwani, a Samajwadi Party MP four times
 aise main is baar dharmendra yadav ke liye badaayun seat dharmendra yadav ke liye chunautiyon se bhari he
 Badaun's ethnic constituency is Badaun Yadav and Muslim majority district
 isliye sapa kii daavedaari yahaan majboot rahi he
 SP has already practiced the yadav-muslim factor through social engineering
 is sameekaran ko saadhane main sapa safal bhi rahi he
 Perhaps this is why the party has been in the seat for more than 2 decades
 pichley 6 loksabhaa chunaav se sapa is seat par ajey rahi he
 Dharmendra Yadav has also won elections from here twice in a row
 uttar pradesh ke sabase bade raajnneetik parivaar se aane vaale dharmendra yadav mulaayam singh yadav ke bhattije hai
 Dharmendra Singh Yadav is the son of Mulayam Singh's elder brother Abhay Ram Yadav
 apane raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat unhone bataur block pramukh ke taur par kii thi
 In 2004, he won the by-election from Mainpuri, but in 2009 and 2014 he won from here
 2004 se hi vah sansad main kai cametiyon kaa sadsy hai
 According to ADR data he has assets of more than 2 crores
 dharmendra yadav ne apni saansad nidhi se kareeb 75 fisadi raashi kharch kii
 Samajwadi Party (SP) MP from Badaun, Dharmendra Yadav, had asked his brother-in-law Anujesh Pratap Singh to break all ties with him when he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 dharmendra yadav ne kaha tha unhen pataa chalaa he ki anujesh pratap singh 24 march ko bijepi main shaamil hue hai
 He had clearly said that he could never have any relation with any BJP leader
 isliye anujesh pratap singh se bhi ab unka koi rishta nahin he
 Dharmendra Yadav had requested that Anujesh Pratap Singh not be called his relative

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter karnataka main congress ne janata dal (secular) ke saath milakar bhartiya janata party ko satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane se roak diya
 Although the BJP, riding on the victorious chariot, won the maximum number of seats, the majority changed its dream of feeding the lotus in the south
 ab jedies netaa echdi kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane kaa mauka mila he, lekin bahumat ke bavandar se nikalnaa unke liye bhi chunauteepurn ho saktaa he
 In fact, since the results were declared on May 15, the political face of Karnataka, which has been seen, does not seem to be suitable for Kumaraswamy
 chaar dinon tak bahumat sabit karne kii jugat main lagi rahi bijepi se apane vidhayakon ko bachaane ke liye congress or jedies ko pehle bengalooru ke resort kaa aasraa lenaa padaa
 After this, when the situation looked more fragile, the MLA group had to be sent to Hyderabad
 lunch par kisi ko milane nahin diya19 may ko bijepi netaa bies yediurppa ko vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karnaa tha, jisase thik pehle vidhansabha satr main hissaa lene ke liye donon partiyaan apane vidhayak lekar pahunchi
 During this period also, two of the 78 Congress mlas remained absent for hours, which became the subject of discussion
 yahaan tak ki vidhansabha kii kaarywahi sthagit hone ke baad congress-jedies ne apane vidhayakon ko lunch bhi vidhansabha parisar ke andar hi karaayaa or kisi bhi bijepi vidhayak yaa netaa ko unase milane nahin diya gaya
 On the other hand, backward BJP sources in proving majority, told Aaj Tak that the congress-jds mlas were to be negotiated for support during lunch in the assembly, as they were kept in hiding since the results were out
 lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 Anticipating resentment at the ministerial position, Kumaraswamy's trouble is also a major reason for the Cabinet
 shanivaar (19 may) shaam rajyapal se sarkaar banane kaa aamantran milane ke baad congress or jedies main sarkaar kaa formula bhi tay ho gaya he
 It is being told that 20 ministers from the Congress camp and 13 from the JDS account will be part of Kumaraswamy cabinet
 haalanki, ek nirdaleey va do anya vidhayakon ko lekar abhi koi jaankaree nahin he
 The Congress has a total of 78 mlas, while the JDS has 37 and two others with one Independent MLA
 aise main is baat kii ashanka he ki sadan main bahumat sabit hone se pehle mantri pad ko lekar vidhayakon main naaraazgi dekhne ko mil sakati he
 If something like this happens, the BJP can try its best to capitalize on such an opportunity and repeat 'operation Lotus' in Karnataka politics once again
 23 may ko shapathgrahanhaalanki, abhi tak cabinet ko lekar aadhikarik taur par koi elaan nahin kiya gaya he
 But it will be interesting to see how the Congress and JDS mlas who have offered CM seats to JDS with less seats in the coalition support Kumaraswamy on the issue of cabinet formation
 yah shaayad donon partiyon ke sheersh netritv kii chintaa hi he ki ab tak unhone apane vidhayakon ko hotel main rakhaa hua he
 It is being told that after Kumaraswamy's swearing-in on May 23, mlas will not be 'liberated' until they prove a majority in the House
 udhar, kumaraswami ne kaha he ki vah shapathgrahan ke 24 ghante ke andar bahumat sabit kar denge
 13 states of the country are struggling with drought and water crisis
 pani kii killat se nipatane ke liye desh ke suukhaagrast 13 rajyon ke kisaanon, mahilaon or chaatro ne aage aakar jal satyagrah kiya
 Under this, people marched from Rajghat to Parliament on a scorching afternoon
 is satyagrah main skool ke bachche bhi jute
 Everyone together fought for the thirst of themselves and the earth
 janata ne pesh kiya vidheyak draftsukhe se nipatane aurapani ke sangrakshanpar janata kii ichha or jaruraton kaa vidheyak draft bhi pesh kiya gaya
 Many demands were placed in the draft bill
 1:jalsanrachana nadi, talab, jhil main kisi tarah ke sthai yaa asthai nirmaan, atikaraman, pradooshan, udyog lagane par sakht pabandi honi chahie
 2: The exploitation of the waters of rivers should also be conditional
 3:jal sanghathan ke liye nadi panchayat yaa kshetra sabha banani chahie

 5:is kanoon kaa ulanghan karne par 10 saal tak kaid or adhiktam jurmaana hona chahie
 6: Failure of local authorities should not be considered if the responsibility is not fulfilled and they should be punished under the Indian Penal Code (IPC)

 Chitrangada considers this a big thing for herself, but she says that she can hardly become Smita Patil

 i gave this title because i am a reporter and the job of a reporter is to report what he is seeing, hearing and feeling, keeping in view the circumstances and circumstances
 nirnay sunaanaa yaa faisla karnaa reporter yaa media kaa kaam nahin he
 It is a different thing that we all sometimes try to get ahead by crossing this line, but late in the day one would realize that the basic principle of journalism is relevant even today, not to report, but to give a judgment
 isliye maine bhi jo dekha suna samajha or mahasoos kiya wo bataa rahaa hum
 On Wednesday, 22 April, i reached Jantar Mantar in the morning to cover the Kisan rally of the Aam Aadmi Party
 subah se hi bheed juteni shuru ho gai thi or phir jab dopaher hone lagi thi to meri nazar neem ke ped par chadhe ek shaks par padi
 i felt that a little bit different because usually people who enjoy climbing trees or rally demonstrations at Jantar Mantar do not go to the same height as they had gone
 ab dopaher kaa samay tha, manch par aap ke netaa baari-baari se bhaashan de rahe the ki achaanak jab main media encloger main tha to ek aadmi ne meraa dhyaan ped par dilaane kii koshish kii lekin mujhe samaj nahin aayaa or usne kaha 'apana desh bhi kamaal he, yahaan ek se ek hai' (usne ishaara to kiya lekin mujhe naa kuch samaj aayaa or naa kuch dikhaai diya)
 But for a while my eyes fell on the person i saw climbing on the tree
 ab meri samaj main wo baat bhi ai ki kuch kshan pehle ek shaks mujhe kya kah rahaa tha, isi ped ke upar chadhe shaks ke bare main('apana desh bhi kamaal he, yahaan ek se ek hai)
 ' maine ped par nazar focus kii or dekha ki us kisaan ne gale main ek fanda daal rakhaa he or lag rahaa tha ki wo shaayad kuch naare laga rahaa tha
 i kept an eye on it for a while and i felt that it might want to draw attention to itself or say something or it might not have a good mental state (because in rallies or demonstrations, such cases are often seen
 i do not see any serious issues)
 ab maine apni nazaren usee ped ke thik neeche lagaai to vahaan par guest teacher apane pradarshan main vyast dikhe lekin phir maine or thik se focus kiya to dekha ki usee ilaake main yani ped ke thik neeche zyaadaatar log jo guest teacher the, wo binar yaa poster haath main lekar pradarshan kar rahe the
 Some others were trying to draw attention to the person hanging by clapping or shaking hands towards the stage
 (abhi tak raily main guest teacheron par hi sabakaa dhyaan kendrit tha) Now Kumar Vishwas came to speak on the stage and he first addressed the guest teachers and told them that such a demonstration would do nothing, the Education Minister has met you before and will meet further and serious issues like land acquisition in Kisan rally Such a demonstration would be interpreted as something between
 iske thik baad kumaar vishwaas ne us aadmi se apil kii jo ped par chadhakar faansee kaa fanda gale main daale hue tha
 Kumar appealed to the man to come down and say whatever he wanted to say and appealed to the police to take it down
 maine apni nazaren waapas us aadmi par lagaai to dekha ki usne gale main fanda daalkar apane donon haathon se usee daali ko pakadaa hua he jisase usne fanda baandha tha or uske baayen pair ke paas bhi ek tahani he jisase usko saport mil rahaa he
 When the police did not act, Kumar Vishwas accused the police of acting in a planned manner at someone's behest
 jahaan par main khadaa tha or jahaan tak main dekh paaya, mujhe pulisavaale mookadarshak bane dikhaai diye
 Nowhere does it appear that the police is trying to save the man by climbing a tree
 iske baad kuch log ped par chadhe or us aadmi ko utaarne kii koshish karne lage or unki koshish se laga ki ye koi export nahin, is tarah ke halaat se nipatane ke
 The man was rushed to the hospital as soon as he was lowered from the tree
 uske baad maine logon ko ped se neeche utarate dekha jisamen ek safed kapadon main neeche aata banda ped par hi rone laga to baaki logon ne usko gale lagaakar shant kiya
 (though i cried later and i came to know who he is
 wo 'aap' kaa walantier tha jisane us aadmi ko bachaane kii koshish kii or maine uskaa intervyuu bhi kiya
 ) kuch der ke liye sabha rukii hui thi
 The meeting resumed during this entire incident and when he was sent to the hospital
 main apni jagah par vahiin media ke liye banaae gaye stage par rahaa or apane cameraperson ko bhi vahiin rakhana sunishchit kiya kyonki mere or us neem ke ped ke bich hazaron log the or vahaan jaakar main karata kya, bheed badhaata or kisi sambhavit koshish main baadha banataa? kyonki mujhe to ped par chadhana bhi nahin aata or saath main baat ye bhi ki jab koi aatmahatya ke prayaas main hota he to usko rijhaanaa or manaanaa padataa he varna maamla kharaab bhi ho saktaa he, isliye ye kaam koi export hi kar saktaa he
 In the meantime, there was only discussion among the people present whether the man survived or died
 mere paas jo khabar ai wo ye thi ki haalat behad kharaab he
 My experience said that the doctor will tell whether he is alive or not, how can we tell (because as long as i was present in the rally, there was news that he survived, sometimes it was reported that he was not)
 jab sabha aage badi to ab meraa dhyaan do baton par tha
 One was the guest teacher who had come and performed in large numbers since morning and now the other man who was trying to commit suicide is now alive or not
 jab aakhri main arvind kejariwal bolne aae to pehle unhone us aadmi ke bare main bolaa or phir kisaanon ke mudde par kareeb das pandrah minute bhaashan diya
 But during this period, which had been apprehensive since morning, the guest teachers stepped up their display and started showing black flags and the rally ended among them all
 siem kejariwal or dipti siem sisodiya aspataal ke liye ravaanaa hue
 The comments aage kii kahani or vishleshan agle hisse main

 ab meri samaj main wo baat bhi ai ki kuch kshan pehle ek shaks mujhe kya kah rahaa tha, isi ped ke upar chadhe shaks ke bare main('apana desh bhi kamaal he, yahaan ek se ek hai)
 ' maine ped par nazar focus kii or dekha ki us kisaan ne gale main ek fanda daal rakhaa he or lag rahaa tha ki wo shaayad kuch naare laga rahaa tha
 i kept an eye on it for a while and i felt that it might want to draw attention to itself or say something or it might not have a good mental state (because in rallies or demonstrations, such cases are often seen
 i do not see any serious issues)
 ab maine apni nazaren usee ped ke thik neeche lagaai to vahaan par guest teacher apane pradarshan main vyast dikhe lekin phir maine or thik se focus kiya to dekha ki usee ilaake main yani ped ke thik neeche zyaadaatar log jo guest teacher the, wo binar yaa poster haath main lekar pradarshan kar rahe the
 Some others were trying to draw attention to the person hanging by clapping or shaking hands towards the stage
 (abhi tak raily main guest teacheron par hi sabakaa dhyaan kendrit tha) Now Kumar Vishwas came to speak on the stage and he first addressed the guest teachers and told them that such a demonstration would do nothing, the Education Minister has met you before and will meet further and serious issues like land acquisition in Kisan rally Such a demonstration would be interpreted as something between
 iske thik baad kumaar vishwaas ne us aadmi se apil kii jo ped par chadhakar faansee kaa fanda gale main daale hue tha
 Kumar appealed to the man to come down and say whatever he wanted to say and appealed to the police to take it down
 maine apni nazaren waapas us aadmi par lagaai to dekha ki usne gale main fanda daalkar apane donon haathon se usee daali ko pakadaa hua he jisase usne fanda baandha tha or uske baayen pair ke paas bhi ek tahani he jisase usko saport mil rahaa he
 When the police did not act, Kumar Vishwas accused the police of acting in a planned manner at someone's behest
 jahaan par main khadaa tha or jahaan tak main dekh paaya, mujhe pulisavaale mookadarshak bane dikhaai diye
 Nowhere does it appear that the police is trying to save the man by climbing a tree
 iske baad kuch log ped par chadhe or us aadmi ko utaarne kii koshish karne lage or unki koshish se laga ki ye koi export nahin, is tarah ke halaat se nipatane ke
 The man was rushed to the hospital as soon as he was lowered from the tree
 uske baad maine logon ko ped se neeche utarate dekha jisamen ek safed kapadon main neeche aata banda ped par hi rone laga to baaki logon ne usko gale lagaakar shant kiya
 (though i cried later and i came to know who he is
 wo 'aap' kaa walantier tha jisane us aadmi ko bachaane kii koshish kii or maine uskaa intervyuu bhi kiya
 ) kuch der ke liye sabha rukii hui thi
 The meeting resumed during this entire incident and when he was sent to the hospital
 main apni jagah par vahiin media ke liye banaae gaye stage par rahaa or apane cameraperson ko bhi vahiin rakhana sunishchit kiya kyonki mere or us neem ke ped ke bich hazaron log the or vahaan jaakar main karata kya, bheed badhaata or kisi sambhavit koshish main baadha banataa? kyonki mujhe to ped par chadhana bhi nahin aata or saath main baat ye bhi ki jab koi aatmahatya ke prayaas main hota he to usko rijhaanaa or manaanaa padataa he varna maamla kharaab bhi ho saktaa he, isliye ye kaam koi export hi kar saktaa he
 In the meantime, there was only discussion among the people present whether the man survived or died
 mere paas jo khabar ai wo ye thi ki haalat behad kharaab he
 My experience said that the doctor will tell whether he is alive or not, how can we tell (because as long as i was present in the rally, there was news that he survived, sometimes it was reported that he was not)
 jab sabha aage badi to ab meraa dhyaan do baton par tha
 One was the guest teacher who had come and performed in large numbers since morning and now the other man who was trying to commit suicide is now alive or not
 jab aakhri main arvind kejariwal bolne aae to pehle unhone us aadmi ke bare main bolaa or phir kisaanon ke mudde par kareeb das pandrah minute bhaashan diya
 But during this period, which had been apprehensive since morning, the guest teachers stepped up their display and started showing black flags and the rally ended among them all
 siem kejariwal or dipti siem sisodiya aspataal ke liye ravaanaa hue

 is aalekh main di gai kisi bhi soochna kii sateekta, sampoornataa, vyaavhaarikta athwa sachai ke prati enditivi uttaradaayi nahin he
 All the information in this article is presented as it is
 is aalekh main di gai koi bhi soochna athwa tathy athwa vyakt kiye gaye vichaar enditivi ke nahin hai, tathaa enditivi unke liye kisi bhi prakaar se uttaradaayi nahin he
 It was now noon, the leaders of the AAP were giving a turn-by-turn speech that suddenly when i was in the media enclosure, a man tried to bring my attention to the tree but i could not understand and he said 'your country Also awesome, here is one to one '(he hinted but i did not understand anything and did not see anything)
 lekin thodi der baar meri nazar usee shaks par padi jisko maine ped ke upar chadhate dekha tha
 Now i also understand what a person was telling me a few moments ago, about a man who has climbed on the same tree ('apna Desh is awesome, here is one to one)
 ' i focused on the tree and saw that the farmer put a noose around his neck and it seemed that he was probably shouting some slogans
 kuch der tak maine us par nazar banaae rakhi or mujhe laga ki shaayad ye apni taraf dhyaan kheenchna chahta he yaa kuch kahana chahta he yaa ho saktaa he isaki maansik sthiti thik naa ho(kyonki aksar reliyon yaa pradarshnon main aise maamle dekhe jate hai jo baad main koi gambhir masalaa nahin dikhte)
 Now i set my eyes just below the same tree, then there the guest teacher appeared busy in his performance but then i focused more properly and saw that most of the people in the same area, just below the tree, were the guest teacher, that banner or poster Performing with hand in hand
 duusare kuch log tali bajaakar yaa manch kii ore haath hilaakar us faansee lagaae shaks kii ore dhyaan dilaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 (till now all the focus was on the guest teachers in the rally) ab manch par kumaar vishwaas bolne aae or unhone sabase pehle guest teacheron ko sambodhit kiya or unako kaha ki is tarah se pradarshan karne se kuch nahin hoga, shiksha mantri aapse pehle bhi mili hai or aage bhi milenge or kisaan raily main jameen adhigrahan jaise gambhir mudde ke bich is tarah ke pradarshan kaa kuch matlab nikaala jayega
 Shortly thereafter, Kumar Vishwas appealed to the man who was climbing the tree and hugging the noose
 kumaar ne us aadmi se apil kii ki kripaya neeche aa jaaen or jo baat kahana chaahate hai kahie or police se apil kii ki kripaya isko neeche utaariye
 When i put my eyes back on the man, i saw that he was holding the noose with his two hands with a noose around his neck with which he tied the noose and there is also a twig near his left leg which is supporting him
 jab police harakat main nahin ai to kumaar vishwaas ne police par kisi ke ishaare par yojanabaddh tareeke se kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Where i was standing and as far as i could see, i saw the policemen becoming mute spectators
 kahin aisa nahin dikhaa ki police koi koshish kar rahi ho ped par chadhakar us aadmi ko bachaane kii
 After this, some people climbed the tree and started trying to take down the man, and by their efforts, they felt that it was not an expert to deal with such a situation
 us aadmi ko jaise taise ped se utaara gaya, aspataal ke liye ravaanaa kiya gaya
 After that, i saw people coming down from the tree, in which the Banda coming down in a white cloth started crying on the tree, then the rest of the people hugged him and pacified him
 (haalanki wo royaa kyon or wo he koun ye mujhe baad main pataa chalaa
 He was a volunteer of AAP who tried to save the man and i interviewed him too
 ) The meeting was halted for a while
 is puri ghatana ke dauraan or jab usko aspataal bhej diya gaya to sabha phir shuru hui
 i stayed at my place on the stage made for the media and made sure to keep my cameraperson there as there were thousands of people between me and that neem tree and what i would do there, increase the crowd and hinder any possible efforts The Because i do not even know how to climb a tree and also talk that when someone is in an attempt to commit suicide, they have to be persuaded and persuaded or else the matter may be bad, so only an expert can do this work
 is bich vahaan maujuud logon main bas yahi charchaa chalati rahi ki wo aadmi batch gaya yaa mar gaya
 The news that came to me was that the condition is very bad
 mere anubhav ne kaha ki wo zindaa he yaa nahin ye doctor bataaenge, ham kaise bataaen(kyonki jab tak main raily main maujuud rahaa kabhi khabar ai ki wo batch gaya to kabhi khabar ai ki wo nahin rahaa)
 When the meeting proceeded, my focus was now on two things
 ek to guest teacher jo badi sankhya main subah se hi pradarshan karne aae the or kar rahe the or ab doosraa wo aadmi jo aatmahatya kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha wo ab jivit he yaa nahin
 When Arvind Kejriwal came to speak in the last, he first spoke about the man and then gave a speech about ten to fifteen minutes on the issue of farmers
 lekin is dauraan jo subah se ashankit tha, guest teacheron ne apana pradarshan tej kiya or kaale jhande dikhaane lage or in sabake bich raily samaapt hui
 CM Kejriwal and deputy CM Sisodia left for the hospital

 iske baad kuch log ped par chadhe or us aadmi ko utaarne kii koshish karne lage or unki koshish se laga ki ye koi export nahin, is tarah ke halaat se nipatane ke
 The man was rushed to the hospital as soon as he was lowered from the tree
 uske baad maine logon ko ped se neeche utarate dekha jisamen ek safed kapadon main neeche aata banda ped par hi rone laga to baaki logon ne usko gale lagaakar shant kiya
 (though i cried later and i came to know who he is
 wo 'aap' kaa walantier tha jisane us aadmi ko bachaane kii koshish kii or maine uskaa intervyuu bhi kiya
 ) kuch der ke liye sabha rukii hui thi
 The meeting resumed during this entire incident and when he was sent to the hospital
 main apni jagah par vahiin media ke liye banaae gaye stage par rahaa or apane cameraperson ko bhi vahiin rakhana sunishchit kiya kyonki mere or us neem ke ped ke bich hazaron log the or vahaan jaakar main karata kya, bheed badhaata or kisi sambhavit koshish main baadha banataa? kyonki mujhe to ped par chadhana bhi nahin aata or saath main baat ye bhi ki jab koi aatmahatya ke prayaas main hota he to usko rijhaanaa or manaanaa padataa he varna maamla kharaab bhi ho saktaa he, isliye ye kaam koi export hi kar saktaa he
 In the meantime, there was only discussion among the people present whether the man survived or died
 mere paas jo khabar ai wo ye thi ki haalat behad kharaab he
 My experience said that the doctor will tell whether he is alive or not, how can we tell (because as long as i was present in the rally, there was news that he survived, sometimes it was reported that he was not)
 jab sabha aage badi to ab meraa dhyaan do baton par tha
 One was the guest teacher who had come and performed in large numbers since morning and now the other man who was trying to commit suicide is now alive or not
 jab aakhri main arvind kejariwal bolne aae to pehle unhone us aadmi ke bare main bolaa or phir kisaanon ke mudde par kareeb das pandrah minute bhaashan diya
 But during this period, which had been apprehensive since morning, the guest teachers stepped up their display and started showing black flags and the rally ended among them all

 is aalekh main di gai kisi bhi soochna kii sateekta, sampoornataa, vyaavhaarikta athwa sachai ke prati enditivi uttaradaayi nahin he
 All the information in this article is presented as it is
 is aalekh main di gai koi bhi soochna athwa tathy athwa vyakt kiye gaye vichaar enditivi ke nahin hai, tathaa enditivi unke liye kisi bhi prakaar se uttaradaayi nahin he
 When i put my eyes back on the man, i saw that he was holding the noose with his two hands with a noose around his neck with which he tied the noose and there is also a twig near his left leg which is supporting him
 jab police harakat main nahin ai to kumaar vishwaas ne police par kisi ke ishaare par yojanabaddh tareeke se kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Where i was standing and as far as i could see, i saw the policemen becoming mute spectators
 kahin aisa nahin dikhaa ki police koi koshish kar rahi ho ped par chadhakar us aadmi ko bachaane kii
 After this, some people climbed the tree and started trying to take down the man, and by their efforts, they felt that it was not an expert to deal with such a situation
 us aadmi ko jaise taise ped se utaara gaya, aspataal ke liye ravaanaa kiya gaya
 After that, i saw people coming down from the tree, in which the Banda coming down in a white cloth started crying on the tree, then the rest of the people hugged him and pacified him
 (haalanki wo royaa kyon or wo he koun ye mujhe baad main pataa chalaa
 He was a volunteer of AAP who tried to save the man and i interviewed him too
 ) The meeting was halted for a while
 is puri ghatana ke dauraan or jab usko aspataal bhej diya gaya to sabha phir shuru hui
 i stayed at my place on the stage made for the media and made sure to keep my cameraperson there as there were thousands of people between me and that neem tree and what i would do there, increase the crowd and hinder any possible efforts The Because i do not even know how to climb a tree and also talk that when someone is in an attempt to commit suicide, they have to be persuaded and persuaded or else the matter may be bad, so only an expert can do this work
 is bich vahaan maujuud logon main bas yahi charchaa chalati rahi ki wo aadmi batch gaya yaa mar gaya
 The news that came to me was that the condition is very bad
 mere anubhav ne kaha ki wo zindaa he yaa nahin ye doctor bataaenge, ham kaise bataaen(kyonki jab tak main raily main maujuud rahaa kabhi khabar ai ki wo batch gaya to kabhi khabar ai ki wo nahin rahaa)
 When the meeting proceeded, my focus was now on two things
 ek to guest teacher jo badi sankhya main subah se hi pradarshan karne aae the or kar rahe the or ab doosraa wo aadmi jo aatmahatya kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha wo ab jivit he yaa nahin
 When Arvind Kejriwal came to speak in the last, he first spoke about the man and then gave a speech about ten to fifteen minutes on the issue of farmers
 lekin is dauraan jo subah se ashankit tha, guest teacheron ne apana pradarshan tej kiya or kaale jhande dikhaane lage or in sabake bich raily samaapt hui
 CM Kejriwal and deputy CM Sisodia left for the hospital

 The mob has become a police in itself and the court that catches and decides to kill someone
 koi sawaal na kare isliye sabase acha he gau taskari kaa aarope laga do taaki dharm kaa kavach mil jaae jabaki samvidhan main kahin nahin likhaa he ki dharm or aasthaa kii raksha ke naam par kisi kii hatya kii ja sakati he
 Faith has been used for debates on TV to social media so that with little condemnation of such incidents, the ideological and political thinking behind it is also defended
 bheed ek ko maarthi he magar us ek ko maarane ke peeche bheed main shaamil kitne log hatyare banate hai or kitne log dangai banate hai, sirf itnaa hi soch lenge to samaj aayega ki yah project maarane kaa nahin he, yah project he samaaj ke bheetar aasthaa ke naam par hatyara banane kaa
 So that mindless people take the law in hand and kill someone
 india spend ke ellison saldanha, pranav rajput or jai hazaare ne 9 july 2018 ko ek report likhi
 Based on the report published on the media, a figure has been prepared from the news of the murder of the mob
 2010 se abtak gaay ko lekar bheed ke 85 hamale darj hue hai
 98% of incidents have occurred since 2014
 iske pehle 2012 or 2013 main maatr ek ek ghatana hoti he
 56 percent of the Muslims were victims of these attacks and 88 percent of those who died were Muslims
 2018 ke saal main jitne bhi log maare gaye, sabhi musalmaan the
 Some Hindus have also been beaten up for alleged cow smuggling
 ajeeb tarah se samaaj main kabhi baccha chori to kabhi gau taskari to kabhi lav jihad ke naam par testing kar rahi he
 The people are dying and the political base is getting stronger
 india spend ke anusaar 1 janvari 2017 se july 2018 ke bich baccha chori kii afvaah se jude hamalon ke 69 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 In which more than 33 people have died and more than 99 have been injured
 agar aapako lagata he ki bheed raat ke andhere main apana kaam karti he to aap or bhi galat hai
 She does this work in broad daylight and does her work absolutely close to the court premises
 17 july ko bharat kaa sarvocch nyaayalay ne bheed kii hinsa par kaabo paane ke liye ek vyapak disha nirdesh main bataaya he ki police kii vyavastha kaise kaam karegi, khufia vyavastha kaise kaam karegi or kiski kya javabdehi hogi
 Four days later, a mob in Alwar kills Rakbar Khan
 supreme court ne police kii javabdehi tay kii thi magar logon or police par kya asar padaa he aapane alvar main dekha, ab ham aapako ghaziabad vaali ricarding phir se dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 To tell that the place where these people are killing this boy is not a village farm but a view outside the tehsil court of Ghaziabad district
 court ke kareeb ye log bina kisi kanoon or court ke khuf ke is ladke ko maar rahe hai
 The one who is killing is Sohail from Bhopal
 sohail ne agar koi samvidhan virdohi, kanoon virdohi kaam kiya hota to vah court nahin jaataa
 He fell in love with a girl, so he went to the court to marry a coincidentally Hindu, like Sohail by coincidence, a Muslim
 priti or sohail ek hi jagah kaam karte the, pyaar ho gaya or shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 Friends told them that it would be safe to marry in court, but the goons surrounded them on the way to the court
 police ne apni taraf se agyaat logon ke khilaaf exiaar darj kar lee he kyonki sohail or priti ne maamla darj nahin karaayaa
 On Monday, when the Alwar incident was being debated in the media from the Parliament, questions were being raised about the uncontrollable crowd, on the same day, on Monday, some people were surrounded by Sohail and Preeti near the court premises
 yaheen sansad se ghante bhar kii duuri par ghaziabad main
 In December 2017 in the same Ghaziabad, 100 people from organizations like BJP, Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal and Jai Shiv Sena gathered outside a house in Rajnagar
 hindustan times kii report main likhaa he ki ek hindu ladki ek muslim ladke se shaadi karne vaali thi
 BJP leader Ajay Sharma was also leading the crowd
 magar jab baat saamne ai to unhen nagar adhyaksh ke pad se hataa diya gaya
 Ajay Sharma is in BJP and his Facebook shows that he is the regional minister of West Uttar Pradesh
 nagar adhyaksh ke baad lagata he ki pramot hokar kshetreey mantri bane hai
 The question is not, the question is what happened to the crowd that came to surround the house
 hindustan times kii report ke anusaar bheed par danga bhadakaane, ghaatak hathiyaar lekar jamaa hone, kisi kii jaan par khatra daalane, hamalaa karne kii dharaaen lagaai gai thim
 What were the consequences of such severe clauses, how did the law work, if all are asked by the Supreme Court, it will be fine
 ek saal se kam samay main ghaziabad main dobaaraa aisi ghatana ghat jaati he
 Thankfully, the parents of the girl and the boy did not come under this pressure and married and married there
 na alvar main kuch badla or na ghaziabad main kuch badla
 In Barmer, Rajasthan, a Dalit boy Khetram Bhil fell in love with a Muslim girl
 us ladke hi hatya kar di he
 Khetram is also surrounded by a mob
 uski maut hui
 The police have arrested Pathai Khan and Anwar Khan
 isi march main kerala kii haadia ke maamle main faisla dete hue court ne kaha tha ki haadia ko apane sapane puure karne kii puri azaadi he
 Hadiya's parents had objected that she changed her religion to marry Shafin Jahan
 kerala hai court ne donon kii shaadi khaarij kar di thi magar supreme court ne hai court ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya
 The court said that Hadiya's father's thinking could not curb Hadiya's rights
 haadia ko khud par sampurna swaittata hasil he
 Faith is very important for a person's meaningful existence
 apni azaadi se aasthaa kaa chunaav karnaa bhi bahut zaruri he
 And it reinforces the core sentiments of the Constitution
 adaalat ke faislon kaa samaaj or sansthaaon par kya asar padataa he, ghaziabad or alvar main dikh rahaa he
 The mob shoots, surrounds Rakbar and kills him
 police pahunch kar bhi rakabar ko ghumaati rah jaati he or aadmi se pehle gaay bachaane ke liye gumti rah jaati he
 a year ago there was so much debate about the killing of Pehlu Khan, there should have been some change in the functioning of the police
 rakabar khan se pehle 20 july ko bhi bheed ne ek trek dryver ko utaar kar maaraa tha
 This means that the crowd in Alwar is now permanent
 hamaari sahyogi nimisha jaisawal ne hashim trek dryver se baat kii
 Hashim also lodged a police complaint regarding the assault with him, but nothing has happened so far
 hashim akelaa kamaane vaala he or jab vah ghar se nahin nikal saktaa to sochie uski aarthik sthiti kya hogi
 Even when there is no uproar, is the police ready to act strictly in such cases, if it remains, what is its result
 alvar main is belgaum bheed ke peeche gambhirtha se jaanch honi chahie
 This means that everything is not happening suddenly and coincidentally
 rakabar ko gau taskar bataane kaa prayaas chal rahaa he
 Like the law has given the right to kill the mob for this reason
 sthaneey vakil mohammad isharq ne bataaya he ki rakabar par gau taskari kaa koi maamla darj nahin he
 Rakbar's family has denied such earlier allegations
 vakil isharak kaa kahana he ki cese tha magar akbar ke khilaaf tha
 Nimisha went to Kolgaon village of Rakbar
 vahaan jaakar parivaar kaa haal dekha
 Due to this Hindu Muslim debate, it is necessary to go to Rakbar's house to know how the poor people are getting wrapped up
 garibi ko samajhane ke liye or is hinsa ke parinaam ko samajhane ke liye
 Rakbar's wife is insensible due to shock
 chalane phirane kii haalat main nahin he
 She can neither get up and shout nor fight for the justice of her husband
 rakabar ke saat bachche hai
 28 year old Rakbar was running a family of 11 people
 pathar katata tha or doodh bechata tha
 Been saving money for a long time so that the cow could buy it
 50,000 lekar khanpur gaya tha, do gaay kareedne
 Apart from working as a laborer, he was living by selling milk
 vah paidal lekar aa rahaa tha taaki paise batch jate
 Nimisha went to the aspect of 60 km from here to the house of Aspect Khan, who was killed by the mob in April last year
 pahalu khan ko maarane waalon kaa aaj tak pataa nahin chalaa
 Those who were caught were acquitted and the case against them has been closed
 pahalu ke donon bete bel par baahar hai kyonki in par gau taskari kaa maamla darj ho gaya he
 Aspect lives by selling milk to a family of ten
 gaayen bhi thim magar bech di kyonki ab dar lagata he kab kya musiibat aa jaae
 While waiting for justice, the son of Aspect Khan has now understood that only waiting for justice can be done, cannot be found
 rakabar kii maut ne is parivaar ko phir se daraa diya he
 They know the meaning of this fear
 rakabar kii postmortem report aa gai he
 This report has revealed that Rakbar's lungs had contracted
 chot kii vajah bheetar bheetar khun kaaphi bah gaya tha
 Due to shock, his body went into hyper tension and due to lack of oxygen, the body parts started failing
 postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki vakt par aspataal le jaaya jaataa to rakabar kii jaan batch sakati thi
 It is not surprising that such a mistake would be made by the police ye police kii basic training kaa hissaa hota he ki koi ghayal he to turant aspataal le janaa he
 Even after this, the police continued to drink tea and save the cow
 suspend kiye gaye eesai mohan singh kaa ek video saamne aayaa he
 He does not know anyone is saying that a mistake has been made, forgive or punish
 eesai mohan singh ke galati maanane se baat khatm nahin ho jaati he
 There should be a proper investigation, between whom the phone was received on his phone between twelve o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the morning, whether a legislator was calling, a worker was calling, was Mohan Singh in touch with his superiors It was, then at what time and with which officer i came in contact
 tab jaakar mohan singh kii galati kaa sahi nakshaa saamne aa sakegaa
 However, the high-level committee of police admitted in a day that there was a mistake
 gambhir chook hui he
 If Harsha Kumari Singh had not reached every aspect related to the occasion, would there have been such swift action in this case, the answer would be from what the police did in the case of assault on July 20 with Hashim
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ne bhi ghatnasthal kaa daura kiya he
 The comments ection kaise hoga, iskaa sidhaa matlab is baat se jaataa he ki kya hamaari police raajnneetik dabaavon se mukt he
 The answer lies with the Supreme Court, which gave similar clear guidelines for police reform ten years ago, such as what the police have to do in case of congestion
 police agar satta kii hawa ko nahin samajhati to phir aap hi bataaiye ki jis din supreme court ne bheed kii hinsa ko lekar disha nirdesh tay kiya usee din jharkhand ke pakur main swaami agnivesh ko bheed ne kis tarah se maaraa
 Now if you do not want to see the ideology of the crowd even by their attire, then you should get Padma Shri of this tolerance
 chah din ho gaye magar swaami agnivesh ko maarane vaali is bheed main se koi giraftaar nahin hua he
 While the police can clearly identify from this video recording
 exiaar main prasann mishra, anand tiwari, pintu mandal, ke naam hai
 Media report has stated that Prasanna Mishra is the President of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha
 anand tiwari bhaajapa ke kisaan morcha ke sadsy hai
 Pintu Mandal is the local convenor of the Bajrang Dal
 ashok kumaar ward parshad hai
 Are arrests not being made due to these people being associated with BJP and Sangh
 indian express ke prashanth pandey ne likhaa he ki exiaar main namjad aath logon kaa sidhaa sabandh bhartiya janata party, uski yuva shakha bhartiya janata yuva morcha or aresas se he
 Obviously, this crowd is not being created in the void, coming from somewhere
 agar police khud se bhi kaam nahin karegi, sawaal uthaane par bhi kaam nahin karegi, supreme court ke guideline ke baad bhi kaam nahin karegi to phir insaaf kaa bharosa kaise paidaa hoga
 Has the crowd become bigger than the Supreme Court and the police
 pashchim bengal ke jalpaigudi se baccha chori ke andeh par chaar auraton ko peetane or do ko nanga kar ghumaane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 This incident also happened on Monday
 police ne maukey par pahunch kar bachaaya na hota to bheed inke saath kya karti, bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 These four women went to the Daukimari market
 do auraten micro finans company chali gayi or ek apane sambandhi ke paas or ek kapadaa bechney nikal gai
 Till then someone made a cry that the child thieves had come
 bas turant bheed jamaa ho gai or auraton ko maarane lagi
 Two women were stripped of their clothes
 phir unhen local club main le jaaya gaya
 In the same area, a woman was beaten with a pillar a week ago
 beete shanivaar kii raat madhyapradesh ke singrauli main maansik rup se biimaar ek mahila ko baccha chor bataakar maar diya gaya
 This is your India of today
 vaise ham log stri ko devi bhi maanate hai, shaayad duniya ke kisi bhi desh main stri ko na devi maanate hai or na stri maanate honge, ye kam badi baat nahin he ki ham devi maanate hai
 Since 2010, there have been 85 mob attacks on cows
 jinamein 98 pratishat ghatnaayen 2014 ke baad ghati hai
 Before this only one incident happens in 2012 and 2013
 in hamalon main 56 fisadi musalmaan shikaar hue or marane waalon main 88 fisadi musalmaan the
 All the people killed in the year of 2018 were Muslims
 kathith rup se gaay taskari ke maamle main pitayee ke shikaar kuch hindu bhi hue hai
 Strangely, in the society, sometimes a child is stolen and sometimes cow smuggling is sometimes testing in the name of love jihad
 mar log rahe hai or raajnneetik janaadhar kisi or kaa majboot ho rahaa he
 According to indiaspend, 69 cases of child-theft rumor-related attacks have been reported between 1 January 2017 and July 2018
 jisamen 33 se adhik logon kii maut hui he or 99 se zyaada ghayal hue hai
 If you think that the crowd does its work in the dark of night then you are even more wrong
 wo din dahaade ye kaam karti he or bilkul court parisar ke kareeb apana kaam karti he
 On July 17, the Supreme Court of India has said in a comprehensive guideline to overcome mob violence, how the police system will work, how the intelligence system will work and whose accountability will be there
 iske chaar din baad alvar main bheed rakabar khan ko maar detii he
 The Supreme Court had fixed the accountability of the police, but what effect it has had on the people and the police
 You saw in Alwar, now we want to show you the Ghaziabad recording again
 yah bataane ke liye jis jagah par ye log is ladke ko maar rahe hai wo gaanv kaa khet nahin he balki ghaziabad zile ke tehsil court ke baahar kaa drishy he
 These people close to the court are killing this boy without any law and fear of the court
 jo maar kha rahaa he wo bhopal kaa rahane vaala sohail he
 Sohail would not have gone to court if he had done any anti-constitutional, anti-law work
 usne ek ladki se mohabbat kii isliye vah adaalat ke paas gaya shaadi karne jo ittfa se hindu he jaise ki sohail ittefaq se muslim he
 Preity and Sohail worked at the same place, fell in love and wanted to get married
 doston ne inase kaha ki court main shaadi karne se surakshit rahegaa magar court pahunchane ke raste main hi gundon ne gher liya
 The police has filed an FIR against unknown people on its behalf as Sohail and Preity did not register a case
 somvaar ko jab sansad se lekar media main alvar kii ghatana par bahes ho rahi thi, bekaabu hoti bheed ko lekar sawaal ho rahe the, usee din yani somvaar ko kuch log sohail or priti ko court parisar ke paas gher kar maar rahe the
 Here in Ghaziabad, an hour's distance from Parliament
 isi ghaziabad main disambar 2017 main pichley saal bijepi, shivasena, bajrang dal or jai shivasena jaise sanghathanon ke 100 log rajnagar ke ek ghar ke baahar jamaa ho gaye
 The Hindustan Times report states that a Hindu girl was about to marry a Muslim boy
 bijepi ke netaa ajay sharma bhi us bheed kaa netritv kar rahe the
 But when it came to light, he was removed from the post of city president
 ajay sharma bijepi main hi hai or unke fasebuk se pataa chalata he ki pashchim uttar pradesh ke kshetreey mantri hai
 After the city president, it seems that Promotions have become regional ministers
 sawaal yah nahin, sawaal yah he ki us bheed kaa kya hua, jo ghar gherne ai thi
 According to the report of Hindustan Times, sections of rioting, mobilization of deadly weapons, threatening someone's life, assault were imposed on the crowd
 itani gambhir dhaaraon ke kya nattejey rahe, kanoon se kaise kaam kiya, yah sab ab supreme court hi puche to thik rahegaa
 In less than a year, such incidents happen again in Ghaziabad
 shukr he ladki or ladke ke maa baap is dabaav main nahin aae or shaadi hui or vahiin par hui
 Nothing changed in Alwar nor in Ghaziabad
 rajasthan ke hi barmer main ek dalit ladke khetram bhil ko ek muslim ladki se pyaar ho gaya
 That boy is murdered
 khetram ko bhi bheed ne gher kar maaraa he
 he died in
 police ne pathai khan or anwar khan ko giraftaar kiya he
 In March, while giving a decision in the case of Hadiya of Kerala, the court said that Hadiya has full freedom to fulfill her dreams
 haadia ke maa baap ne etraz zaahir kiya tha ki wo dharm badal kar shafin jahaan se shaadi kar rahi he
 The marriage of both was rejected by the Kerala High Court but the Supreme Court struck down the High Court order
 adaalat ne kaha ki haadia ke pita kii soch haadia ke adhikaron par ankush nahin laga sakati he
 Hadiya herself has full autonomy
 aasthaa kisi vyakti ke arthpurna astitv ke liye behad zaruri he
 It is also very important to choose your faith freely
 or yah samvidhan kii mul bhaawanaaon ko majboot karata he
 The impact of the court's decisions on society and institutions is visible in Ghaziabad and Alwar
 bheed goli chalaati he, rakabar ko gher kar maarthi he or uskaa pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 On reaching the police, they continue to rotate the land and roam before the man to save the cow
 ek saal pehle pahalu khan kii hatya ko lekar itani bahes hui, police ke kaamkaaz main kuch to badlaav aana chahie tha
 On July 20, even before Rakbar Khan, the mob had unloaded and killed a truck driver
 iskaa matlab he alvar main bheed ab sthaayee ho chuki he
 Our colleague Nimisha Jaiswal spoke to the Hashim truck driver
 hashim ne apane saath hui marpet ko lekar police main shikaayat bhi darj karai magar abhi tak kuch nahin hua he
 Hashim is a lone earner and when he cannot get out of the house, imagine what his financial condition will be
 jab hangaamaa nahin hota he tab bhi kya police aise maamalon main sakhti se kaam karne ke liye tatpar rahati he, agar rahati he to uskaa kya riselt he
 This unruly mob in Alwar must be seriously investigated
 iskaa matlab he ki sabakuch achaanak or sanyog se nahin ho rahaa he
 Efforts are on to make Rakbar a cow smuggler
 jaise bheed ko is kaaran se maar dene kaa kanoon ne adhikaar diya ho
 Local lawyer Mohammad Isharq has said that there is no case of cow smuggling registered on Rakbar
 rakabar ke parivaar waalon ne is tarah ke pehle ke aarope se inkaar kiya he
 Lawyer Isharak says that the case was there but was against Akbar
 nimisha rakabar ke gaanv kolgav gayi
 Go there and see the condition of the family
 is hindu muslim dibet ke kaaran garib log kis tarah lapete main aa rahe hai yah jaanane ke liye rakabar ke ghar janaa zaruri he
 To understand poverty and to understand the consequences of this violence
 rakabar kii patni sadame ke kaaran besudh he
 It is not in a condition to move
 vah uthakar na to chilla sakati he or na apane pati ke insaaf ke liye lard sakati he
 Rakbar has seven children
 28 saal kaa rakabar 11 logon kaa parivaar chalaa rahaa tha
 Used to cut stones and sell milk
 bahut dinon se paise bachaa rahaa tha taaki gaay kareed sake
 50,000 went to Khanpur to buy two cows
 mazaduri karne ke alaava vah doodh bechakar guzaaraa kar rahaa tha
 He was coming on foot so that money would be saved
 nimisha yahaan se 60 kimi dur pahalu khan ke ghar gayi jise pichley saal april main bheed ne maar diya tha
 The people who killed aspect Khan have not been found till date
 jinhen pakadaa gaya tha, ve bari ho gaye or unke khilaaf cese band ho chukaa he
 Both the sons of Aspect are out on the vine as a case of cow smuggling has been registered
 pahalu kaa das logon ke parivaar kaa doodh bechakar guzaaraa chalata he
 There were also cows but sold them because now i am afraid when the trouble comes
 insaaf ke intazaar main pahalu khan kaa betaa ab samaj gaya he ki insaaf kaa sirf intazaar hi kiya ja saktaa he, paaya nahin ja saktaa he
 Rakbar's death scares the family again
 ve jaanate hai is dar kaa matlab
 Rakbar's postmortem report has arrived
 is report main yah baat saamne ai he ki rakabar ke fefde main sikudan aa gai thi
 Due to the injury, the internal blood was drained
 sadame ke kaaran uskaa sharir hyper tension main chalaa gaya or oxigen na milane ke kaaran sharir ke ang fail hote chale gaye
 The post-mortem report said that Rakbar's life could have been saved had he been taken to the hospital on time
 yah baat hazam nahin hoti he ki police se aisi chook hogi
 It is a part of basic training of the police that if someone is injured, immediately go to the hospital
 iske baad bhi police chaay piti rahi or gaay bachaati rahi
 a video of suspended ASI Mohan Singh has surfaced
 wo pataa nahin kisi se kah rahaa he ki galati ho gai, maaf kar do yaa sazaa de do
 ASI Mohan Singh's mistake does not end the matter
 baqayada jaanch honi chahie ki saadhe baarah baje raat se lekar subah ke chaar baje ke bich unke phone par kis kis kaa phone aayaa, kya koi vidhayak phone kar rahaa tha, koi kaaryakarta phone kar rahaa tha, kya mohan singh apane varisht adhikariyon ke sampark main tha, tha to kitne baje or kis afasar ke sampark main aayaa
 Then the correct map of Mohan Singh's mistake will be revealed
 vaise police kii ucch stareey cameti ne ek din main maan liya ki galati hui he
 There has been a serious lapse
 agar harsha kumari singh maukey se sambandhit har pahalu tak nahin pahunchati to kya is maamle main waisi twarit karrwai hoti, iskaa jawaab is baat se milegaa ki police ne 20 july ko hashim ke saath marpet ke maamle main kya kiya
 Home of Rajasthan Gulabchand Kataria has also visited the spot
 tippaniyan How action will take place is directly related to whether our police is free from political pressures
 iskaa jawaab supreme court ke paas he jisane das saal pehle police sudhaar ke liye isi tarah kaa saaf-saaf dishanirdesh diya tha jaise bheed ke maamle main police ko kya karnaa he diya gaya he
 If the police do not understand the wind of power, then tell me how the mob killed Swami Agnivesh in Pakur, Jharkhand on the day the Supreme Court set the guidelines for mob violence
 ab agar inke pahanaave se bhi aap bheed kii vichaardhaara ko nahin dekhnaa chaahate hai to aapako is sahansheeltaa kaa padam shri to milanaa hi chahie
 It has been six days but none of this mob that killed Swami Agnivesh has been arrested
 jabaki police chaahe to is video ricarding se saaf-saaf pahchaan sakati he
 The FIR names Prasanna Mishra, Anand Tiwari, Pintu Mandal
 media report main bataaya gaya he ki prasann mishra bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke adhyaksh hai
 Anand Tiwari is a member of the Kisan Morcha of the BJP
 pintu mandal bajrang dal ke sthaneey sanyojak hai
 Ashok Kumar is a ward councilor
 kya in logon ke bijepi or sangh se jude hone ke kaaran giraftaar nahin ho rahi he
 Prashant Pandey of the Indian Express has written that the eight people named in the FIR are directly related to the Bharatiya Janata Party, its youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and the RSS
 zaahir he yah bheed shunya main paidaa nahin ho rahi he, kahin se banakar aa rahi he
 If the police will not work on their own, they will not work even if they raise questions, they will not work even after the guidelines of the Supreme Court, then how will the confidence of justice be born
 kya bheed supreme court or police se bhi badi ho gai he
 On the suspicion of child theft from Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, a case of beating four women and stripping two naked has come to light
 ye ghatana bhi somvaar ko hui he
 If the police had not reached the spot and saved, there is no need to tell what the crowd would have done with them
 ye chaaron auraten daukimary bazaar gai thim
 Two women went to the micro finance company and one went to sell their clothes to another relative
 tab tak kisi ne hallaa kar diya ki baccha chor auraten ai hai
 The bus immediately gathered and started killing the women

 He was then moved to the local club
 isi ilaake main ek saptaah pehle ek aurat ko khambhe se baandh kar peeta gaya tha
 On Saturday night, a mentally ill woman was killed in Singrauli, Madhya Pradesh, as a child thief
 ye aapkaa hamaara aaj kaa bharat he
 By the way, we also consider a woman as a goddess, perhaps in any country of the world, we do not consider a woman as a goddess, nor would i consider a woman, it is no less big that we believe in a goddess
 kathith rup se gaay taskari ke maamle main pitayee ke shikaar kuch hindu bhi hue hai
 Strangely, in the society, sometimes a child is stolen and sometimes cow smuggling is sometimes testing in the name of love jihad
 mar log rahe hai or raajnneetik janaadhar kisi or kaa majboot ho rahaa he
 According to indiaspend, 69 cases of child-theft rumor-related attacks have been reported between 1 January 2017 and July 2018

 17 july ko bharat kaa sarvocch nyaayalay ne bheed kii hinsa par kaabo paane ke liye ek vyapak disha nirdesh main bataaya he ki police kii vyavastha kaise kaam karegi, khufia vyavastha kaise kaam karegi or kiski kya javabdehi hogi
 Four days later, a mob in Alwar kills Rakbar Khan
 supreme court ne police kii javabdehi tay kii thi magar logon or police par kya asar padaa he aapane alvar main dekha, ab ham aapako ghaziabad vaali ricarding phir se dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 To tell that the place where these people are killing this boy is not a village farm but a view outside the tehsil court of Ghaziabad district
 court ke kareeb ye log bina kisi kanoon or court ke khuf ke is ladke ko maar rahe hai
 The one who is killing is Sohail from Bhopal
 sohail ne agar koi samvidhan virdohi, kanoon virdohi kaam kiya hota to vah court nahin jaataa
 He fell in love with a girl, so he went to the court to marry a coincidentally Hindu, like Sohail by coincidence, a Muslim
 priti or sohail ek hi jagah kaam karte the, pyaar ho gaya or shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 Friends told them that it would be safe to marry in court, but the goons surrounded them on the way to the court
 police ne apni taraf se agyaat logon ke khilaaf exiaar darj kar lee he kyonki sohail or priti ne maamla darj nahin karaayaa
 On Monday, when the Alwar incident was being debated in the media from the Parliament, questions were being raised about the uncontrollable crowd, on the same day, on Monday, some people were surrounded by Sohail and Preeti near the court premises
 yaheen sansad se ghante bhar kii duuri par ghaziabad main
 In December 2017 in the same Ghaziabad, 100 people from organizations like BJP, Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal and Jai Shiv Sena gathered outside a house in Rajnagar
 hindustan times kii report main likhaa he ki ek hindu ladki ek muslim ladke se shaadi karne vaali thi
 BJP leader Ajay Sharma was also leading the crowd
 magar jab baat saamne ai to unhen nagar adhyaksh ke pad se hataa diya gaya
 Ajay Sharma is in BJP and his Facebook shows that he is the regional minister of West Uttar Pradesh
 nagar adhyaksh ke baad lagata he ki pramot hokar kshetreey mantri bane hai
 The question is not, the question is what happened to the crowd that came to surround the house
 hindustan times kii report ke anusaar bheed par danga bhadakaane, ghaatak hathiyaar lekar jamaa hone, kisi kii jaan par khatra daalane, hamalaa karne kii dharaaen lagaai gai thim
 What were the consequences of such severe clauses, how did the law work, if all are asked by the Supreme Court, it will be fine
 ek saal se kam samay main ghaziabad main dobaaraa aisi ghatana ghat jaati he
 Thankfully, the parents of the girl and the boy did not come under this pressure and married and married there
 na alvar main kuch badla or na ghaziabad main kuch badla
 In Barmer, Rajasthan, a Dalit boy Khetram Bhil fell in love with a Muslim girl
 us ladke hi hatya kar di he
 Khetram is also surrounded by a mob
 uski maut hui
 The police have arrested Pathai Khan and Anwar Khan
 isi march main kerala kii haadia ke maamle main faisla dete hue court ne kaha tha ki haadia ko apane sapane puure karne kii puri azaadi he
 Hadiya's parents had objected that she changed her religion to marry Shafin Jahan
 kerala hai court ne donon kii shaadi khaarij kar di thi magar supreme court ne hai court ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya
 The court said that Hadiya's father's thinking could not curb Hadiya's rights
 haadia ko khud par sampurna swaittata hasil he
 Faith is very important for a person's meaningful existence
 apni azaadi se aasthaa kaa chunaav karnaa bhi bahut zaruri he
 And it reinforces the core sentiments of the Constitution
 adaalat ke faislon kaa samaaj or sansthaaon par kya asar padataa he, ghaziabad or alvar main dikh rahaa he
 The mob shoots, surrounds Rakbar and kills him
 police pahunch kar bhi rakabar ko ghumaati rah jaati he or aadmi se pehle gaay bachaane ke liye gumti rah jaati he
 a year ago there was so much debate about the killing of Pehlu Khan, there should have been some change in the functioning of the police
 rakabar khan se pehle 20 july ko bhi bheed ne ek trek dryver ko utaar kar maaraa tha
 This means that the crowd in Alwar is now permanent
 hamaari sahyogi nimisha jaisawal ne hashim trek dryver se baat kii
 Hashim also lodged a police complaint regarding the assault with him, but nothing has happened so far
 hashim akelaa kamaane vaala he or jab vah ghar se nahin nikal saktaa to sochie uski aarthik sthiti kya hogi
 Even when there is no uproar, is the police ready to act strictly in such cases, if it remains, what is its result
 alvar main is belgaum bheed ke peeche gambhirtha se jaanch honi chahie
 This means that everything is not happening suddenly and coincidentally
 rakabar ko gau taskar bataane kaa prayaas chal rahaa he
 Like the law has given the right to kill the mob for this reason
 sthaneey vakil mohammad isharq ne bataaya he ki rakabar par gau taskari kaa koi maamla darj nahin he
 Rakbar's family has denied such earlier allegations
 vakil isharak kaa kahana he ki cese tha magar akbar ke khilaaf tha
 Nimisha went to Kolgaon village of Rakbar
 vahaan jaakar parivaar kaa haal dekha
 Due to this Hindu Muslim debate, it is necessary to go to Rakbar's house to know how the poor people are getting wrapped up
 garibi ko samajhane ke liye or is hinsa ke parinaam ko samajhane ke liye
 Rakbar's wife is insensible due to shock
 chalane phirane kii haalat main nahin he
 She can neither get up and shout nor fight for the justice of her husband
 rakabar ke saat bachche hai
 28 year old Rakbar was running a family of 11 people
 pathar katata tha or doodh bechata tha
 Been saving money for a long time so that the cow could buy it
 50,000 lekar khanpur gaya tha, do gaay kareedne
 Apart from working as a laborer, he was living by selling milk
 vah paidal lekar aa rahaa tha taaki paise batch jate
 Nimisha went to the aspect of 60 km from here to the house of Aspect Khan, who was killed by the mob in April last year
 pahalu khan ko maarane waalon kaa aaj tak pataa nahin chalaa
 Those who were caught were acquitted and the case against them has been closed
 pahalu ke donon bete bel par baahar hai kyonki in par gau taskari kaa maamla darj ho gaya he
 Aspect lives by selling milk to a family of ten
 gaayen bhi thim magar bech di kyonki ab dar lagata he kab kya musiibat aa jaae
 While waiting for justice, the son of Aspect Khan has now understood that only waiting for justice can be done, cannot be found
 rakabar kii maut ne is parivaar ko phir se daraa diya he
 They know the meaning of this fear
 rakabar kii postmortem report aa gai he
 This report has revealed that Rakbar's lungs had contracted
 chot kii vajah bheetar bheetar khun kaaphi bah gaya tha
 Due to shock, his body went into hyper tension and due to lack of oxygen, the body parts started failing
 postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki vakt par aspataal le jaaya jaataa to rakabar kii jaan batch sakati thi
 It is not surprising that such a mistake would be made by the police ye police kii basic training kaa hissaa hota he ki koi ghayal he to turant aspataal le janaa he
 Even after this, the police continued to drink tea and save the cow
 suspend kiye gaye eesai mohan singh kaa ek video saamne aayaa he
 He does not know anyone is saying that a mistake has been made, forgive or punish
 eesai mohan singh ke galati maanane se baat khatm nahin ho jaati he
 There should be a proper investigation, between whom the phone was received on his phone between twelve o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the morning, whether a legislator was calling, a worker was calling, was Mohan Singh in touch with his superiors It was, then at what time and with which officer i came in contact
 tab jaakar mohan singh kii galati kaa sahi nakshaa saamne aa sakegaa
 However, the high-level committee of police admitted in a day that there was a mistake
 gambhir chook hui he
 If Harsha Kumari Singh had not reached every aspect related to the occasion, would there have been such swift action in this case, the answer would be from what the police did in the case of assault on July 20 with Hashim
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ne bhi ghatnasthal kaa daura kiya he
 The comments ection kaise hoga, iskaa sidhaa matlab is baat se jaataa he ki kya hamaari police raajnneetik dabaavon se mukt he
 The answer lies with the Supreme Court, which gave similar clear guidelines for police reform ten years ago, such as what the police have to do in case of congestion
 police agar satta kii hawa ko nahin samajhati to phir aap hi bataaiye ki jis din supreme court ne bheed kii hinsa ko lekar disha nirdesh tay kiya usee din jharkhand ke pakur main swaami agnivesh ko bheed ne kis tarah se maaraa
 Now if you do not want to see the ideology of the crowd even by their attire, then you should get Padma Shri of this tolerance
 chah din ho gaye magar swaami agnivesh ko maarane vaali is bheed main se koi giraftaar nahin hua he
 While the police can clearly identify from this video recording
 exiaar main prasann mishra, anand tiwari, pintu mandal, ke naam hai
 Media report has stated that Prasanna Mishra is the President of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha

 indian express ke prashanth pandey ne likhaa he ki exiaar main namjad aath logon kaa sidhaa sabandh bhartiya janata party, uski yuva shakha bhartiya janata yuva morcha or aresas se he
 Obviously, this crowd is not being created in the void, coming from somewhere
 agar police khud se bhi kaam nahin karegi, sawaal uthaane par bhi kaam nahin karegi, supreme court ke guideline ke baad bhi kaam nahin karegi to phir insaaf kaa bharosa kaise paidaa hoga
 Has the crowd become bigger than the Supreme Court and the police
 pashchim bengal ke jalpaigudi se baccha chori ke andeh par chaar auraton ko peetane or do ko nanga kar ghumaane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 This incident also happened on Monday
 police ne maukey par pahunch kar bachaaya na hota to bheed inke saath kya karti, bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 These four women went to the Daukimari market
 do auraten micro finans company chali gayi or ek apane sambandhi ke paas or ek kapadaa bechney nikal gai
 Till then someone made a cry that the child thieves had come
 bas turant bheed jamaa ho gai or auraton ko maarane lagi
 Two women were stripped of their clothes
 phir unhen local club main le jaaya gaya
 In the same area, a woman was beaten with a pillar a week ago
 beete shanivaar kii raat madhyapradesh ke singrauli main maansik rup se biimaar ek mahila ko baccha chor bataakar maar diya gaya
 This is your India of today
 vaise ham log stri ko devi bhi maanate hai, shaayad duniya ke kisi bhi desh main stri ko na devi maanate hai or na stri maanate honge, ye kam badi baat nahin he ki ham devi maanate hai
 To tell that the place where these people are killing this boy is not a village farm but a view outside the tehsil court of Ghaziabad district
 court ke kareeb ye log bina kisi kanoon or court ke khuf ke is ladke ko maar rahe hai
 The one who is killing is Sohail from Bhopal
 sohail ne agar koi samvidhan virdohi, kanoon virdohi kaam kiya hota to vah court nahin jaataa
 He fell in love with a girl, so he went to the court to marry a coincidentally Hindu, like Sohail by coincidence, a Muslim
 priti or sohail ek hi jagah kaam karte the, pyaar ho gaya or shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 Friends told them that it would be safe to marry in court, but the goons surrounded them on the way to the court
 police ne apni taraf se agyaat logon ke khilaaf exiaar darj kar lee he kyonki sohail or priti ne maamla darj nahin karaayaa
 On Monday, when the Alwar incident was being debated in the media from the Parliament, questions were being raised about the uncontrollable crowd, on the same day, on Monday, some people were surrounded by Sohail and Preeti near the court premises
 yaheen sansad se ghante bhar kii duuri par ghaziabad main
 In December 2017 in the same Ghaziabad, 100 people from organizations like BJP, Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal and Jai Shiv Sena gathered outside a house in Rajnagar
 hindustan times kii report main likhaa he ki ek hindu ladki ek muslim ladke se shaadi karne vaali thi
 BJP leader Ajay Sharma was also leading the crowd
 magar jab baat saamne ai to unhen nagar adhyaksh ke pad se hataa diya gaya
 Ajay Sharma is in BJP and his Facebook shows that he is the regional minister of West Uttar Pradesh
 nagar adhyaksh ke baad lagata he ki pramot hokar kshetreey mantri bane hai
 The question is not, the question is what happened to the crowd that came to surround the house
 hindustan times kii report ke anusaar bheed par danga bhadakaane, ghaatak hathiyaar lekar jamaa hone, kisi kii jaan par khatra daalane, hamalaa karne kii dharaaen lagaai gai thim
 What were the consequences of such severe clauses, how did the law work, if all are asked by the Supreme Court, it will be fine
 ek saal se kam samay main ghaziabad main dobaaraa aisi ghatana ghat jaati he
 Thankfully, the parents of the girl and the boy did not come under this pressure and married and married there
 na alvar main kuch badla or na ghaziabad main kuch badla
 In Barmer, Rajasthan, a Dalit boy Khetram Bhil fell in love with a Muslim girl
 us ladke hi hatya kar di he
 Khetram is also surrounded by a mob
 uski maut hui
 The police have arrested Pathai Khan and Anwar Khan
 isi march main kerala kii haadia ke maamle main faisla dete hue court ne kaha tha ki haadia ko apane sapane puure karne kii puri azaadi he
 Hadiya's parents had objected that she changed her religion to marry Shafin Jahan
 kerala hai court ne donon kii shaadi khaarij kar di thi magar supreme court ne hai court ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya
 The court said that Hadiya's father's thinking could not curb Hadiya's rights
 haadia ko khud par sampurna swaittata hasil he
 Faith is very important for a person's meaningful existence
 apni azaadi se aasthaa kaa chunaav karnaa bhi bahut zaruri he
 And it reinforces the core sentiments of the Constitution
 adaalat ke faislon kaa samaaj or sansthaaon par kya asar padataa he, ghaziabad or alvar main dikh rahaa he
 The mob shoots, surrounds Rakbar and kills him
 police pahunch kar bhi rakabar ko ghumaati rah jaati he or aadmi se pehle gaay bachaane ke liye gumti rah jaati he
 a year ago there was so much debate about the killing of Pehlu Khan, there should have been some change in the functioning of the police
 rakabar khan se pehle 20 july ko bhi bheed ne ek trek dryver ko utaar kar maaraa tha
 This means that the crowd in Alwar is now permanent
 hamaari sahyogi nimisha jaisawal ne hashim trek dryver se baat kii
 Hashim also lodged a police complaint regarding the assault with him, but nothing has happened so far
 hashim akelaa kamaane vaala he or jab vah ghar se nahin nikal saktaa to sochie uski aarthik sthiti kya hogi
 Even when there is no uproar, is the police ready to act strictly in such cases, if it remains, what is its result
 alvar main is belgaum bheed ke peeche gambhirtha se jaanch honi chahie
 This means that everything is not happening suddenly and coincidentally
 rakabar ko gau taskar bataane kaa prayaas chal rahaa he
 Like the law has given the right to kill the mob for this reason
 sthaneey vakil mohammad isharq ne bataaya he ki rakabar par gau taskari kaa koi maamla darj nahin he
 Rakbar's family has denied such earlier allegations
 vakil isharak kaa kahana he ki cese tha magar akbar ke khilaaf tha
 Nimisha went to Kolgaon village of Rakbar
 vahaan jaakar parivaar kaa haal dekha
 Due to this Hindu Muslim debate, it is necessary to go to Rakbar's house to know how the poor people are getting wrapped up
 garibi ko samajhane ke liye or is hinsa ke parinaam ko samajhane ke liye
 Rakbar's wife is insensible due to shock
 chalane phirane kii haalat main nahin he
 She can neither get up and shout nor fight for the justice of her husband

 Nothing changed in Alwar nor in Ghaziabad
 rajasthan ke hi barmer main ek dalit ladke khetram bhil ko ek muslim ladki se pyaar ho gaya
 That boy is murdered
 khetram ko bhi bheed ne gher kar maaraa he
 he died in
 police ne pathai khan or anwar khan ko giraftaar kiya he
 In March, while giving a decision in the case of Hadiya of Kerala, the court said that Hadiya has full freedom to fulfill her dreams
 haadia ke maa baap ne etraz zaahir kiya tha ki wo dharm badal kar shafin jahaan se shaadi kar rahi he
 The marriage of both was rejected by the Kerala High Court but the Supreme Court struck down the High Court order
 adaalat ne kaha ki haadia ke pita kii soch haadia ke adhikaron par ankush nahin laga sakati he
 Hadiya herself has full autonomy
 aasthaa kisi vyakti ke arthpurna astitv ke liye behad zaruri he
 It is also very important to choose your faith freely
 or yah samvidhan kii mul bhaawanaaon ko majboot karata he
 The impact of the court's decisions on society and institutions is visible in Ghaziabad and Alwar
 bheed goli chalaati he, rakabar ko gher kar maarthi he or uskaa pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 On reaching the police, they continue to rotate the land and roam before the man to save the cow
 ek saal pehle pahalu khan kii hatya ko lekar itani bahes hui, police ke kaamkaaz main kuch to badlaav aana chahie tha
 On July 20, even before Rakbar Khan, the mob had unloaded and killed a truck driver
 iskaa matlab he alvar main bheed ab sthaayee ho chuki he
 Our colleague Nimisha Jaiswal spoke to the Hashim truck driver
 hashim ne apane saath hui marpet ko lekar police main shikaayat bhi darj karai magar abhi tak kuch nahin hua he
 Hashim is a lone earner and when he cannot get out of the house, imagine what his financial condition will be
 jab hangaamaa nahin hota he tab bhi kya police aise maamalon main sakhti se kaam karne ke liye tatpar rahati he, agar rahati he to uskaa kya riselt he
 This unruly mob in Alwar must be seriously investigated
 iskaa matlab he ki sabakuch achaanak or sanyog se nahin ho rahaa he
 Efforts are on to make Rakbar a cow smuggler
 jaise bheed ko is kaaran se maar dene kaa kanoon ne adhikaar diya ho
 Local lawyer Mohammad Isharq has said that there is no case of cow smuggling registered on Rakbar
 rakabar ke parivaar waalon ne is tarah ke pehle ke aarope se inkaar kiya he
 Lawyer Isharak says that the case was there but was against Akbar
 nimisha rakabar ke gaanv kolgav gayi
 Go there and see the condition of the family
 is hindu muslim dibet ke kaaran garib log kis tarah lapete main aa rahe hai yah jaanane ke liye rakabar ke ghar janaa zaruri he
 To understand poverty and to understand the consequences of this violence
 rakabar kii patni sadame ke kaaran besudh he
 It is not in a condition to move
 vah uthakar na to chilla sakati he or na apane pati ke insaaf ke liye lard sakati he
 Rakbar has seven children
 28 saal kaa rakabar 11 logon kaa parivaar chalaa rahaa tha
 Used to cut stones and sell milk
 bahut dinon se paise bachaa rahaa tha taaki gaay kareed sake
 50,000 went to Khanpur to buy two cows
 mazaduri karne ke alaava vah doodh bechakar guzaaraa kar rahaa tha
 He was coming on foot so that money would be saved
 nimisha yahaan se 60 kimi dur pahalu khan ke ghar gayi jise pichley saal april main bheed ne maar diya tha
 The people who killed aspect Khan have not been found till date
 jinhen pakadaa gaya tha, ve bari ho gaye or unke khilaaf cese band ho chukaa he
 Both the sons of Aspect are out on the vine as a case of cow smuggling has been registered
 pahalu kaa das logon ke parivaar kaa doodh bechakar guzaaraa chalata he
 There were also cows but sold them because now i am afraid when the trouble comes
 insaaf ke intazaar main pahalu khan kaa betaa ab samaj gaya he ki insaaf kaa sirf intazaar hi kiya ja saktaa he, paaya nahin ja saktaa he
 Rakbar's death scares the family again
 ve jaanate hai is dar kaa matlab
 Rakbar's postmortem report has arrived
 is report main yah baat saamne ai he ki rakabar ke fefde main sikudan aa gai thi
 Due to the injury, the internal blood was drained
 sadame ke kaaran uskaa sharir hyper tension main chalaa gaya or oxigen na milane ke kaaran sharir ke ang fail hote chale gaye
 The post-mortem report said that Rakbar's life could have been saved had he been taken to the hospital on time
 yah baat hazam nahin hoti he ki police se aisi chook hogi
 It is a part of basic training of the police that if someone is injured, immediately go to the hospital
 iske baad bhi police chaay piti rahi or gaay bachaati rahi
 a video of suspended ASI Mohan Singh has surfaced
 wo pataa nahin kisi se kah rahaa he ki galati ho gai, maaf kar do yaa sazaa de do
 ASI Mohan Singh's mistake does not end the matter
 baqayada jaanch honi chahie ki saadhe baarah baje raat se lekar subah ke chaar baje ke bich unke phone par kis kis kaa phone aayaa, kya koi vidhayak phone kar rahaa tha, koi kaaryakarta phone kar rahaa tha, kya mohan singh apane varisht adhikariyon ke sampark main tha, tha to kitne baje or kis afasar ke sampark main aayaa
 Then the correct map of Mohan Singh's mistake will be revealed
 vaise police kii ucch stareey cameti ne ek din main maan liya ki galati hui he
 There has been a serious lapse
 agar harsha kumari singh maukey se sambandhit har pahalu tak nahin pahunchati to kya is maamle main waisi twarit karrwai hoti, iskaa jawaab is baat se milegaa ki police ne 20 july ko hashim ke saath marpet ke maamle main kya kiya
 Rajasthan Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria has also visited the spot
 tippaniyan How action will take place is directly related to whether our police is free from political pressures
 iskaa jawaab supreme court ke paas he jisane das saal pehle police sudhaar ke liye isi tarah kaa saaf-saaf dishanirdesh diya tha jaise bheed ke maamle main police ko kya karnaa he diya gaya he
 If the police do not understand the wind of power, then tell me how the mob killed Swami Agnivesh in Pakur, Jharkhand on the day the Supreme Court set the guidelines for mob violence
 ab agar inke pahanaave se bhi aap bheed kii vichaardhaara ko nahin dekhnaa chaahate hai to aapako is sahansheeltaa kaa padam shri to milanaa hi chahie
 It has been six days but none of this mob that killed Swami Agnivesh has been arrested
 jabaki police chaahe to is video ricarding se saaf-saaf pahchaan sakati he
 The FIR names Prasanna Mishra, Anand Tiwari, Pintu Mandal
 media report main bataaya gaya he ki prasann mishra bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke adhyaksh hai
 Anand Tiwari is a member of the Kisan Morcha of the BJP
 pintu mandal bajrang dal ke sthaneey sanyojak hai
 Ashok Kumar is a ward councilor
 kya in logon ke bijepi or sangh se jude hone ke kaaran giraftaar nahin ho rahi he
 Prashant Pandey of the Indian Express has written that the eight people named in the FIR are directly related to the Bharatiya Janata Party, its youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and the RSS
 zaahir he yah bheed shunya main paidaa nahin ho rahi he, kahin se banakar aa rahi he
 If the police will not work on their own, they will not work even if they raise questions, they will not work even after the guidelines of the Supreme Court, then how will the confidence of justice be born
 kya bheed supreme court or police se bhi badi ho gai he
 On the suspicion of child theft from Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, a case of beating four women and stripping two naked has come to light
 ye ghatana bhi somvaar ko hui he
 If the police had not reached the spot and saved, there is no need to tell what the crowd would have done with them
 ye chaaron auraten daukimary bazaar gai thim
 Two women went to the micro finance company and one went to sell their clothes to another relative
 tab tak kisi ne hallaa kar diya ki baccha chor auraten ai hai
 The bus immediately gathered and started killing the women
 do auraton ke kapade utaar liye gaye
 He was then moved to the local club
 isi ilaake main ek saptaah pehle ek aurat ko khambhe se baandh kar peeta gaya tha
 On Saturday night, a mentally ill woman was killed in Singrauli, Madhya Pradesh, as a child thief
 ye aapkaa hamaara aaj kaa bharat he
 By the way, we also consider a woman as a goddess, perhaps in any country of the world, we do not consider a woman as a goddess, nor would i consider a woman, it is no less big that we believe in a goddess
 adaalat ke faislon kaa samaaj or sansthaaon par kya asar padataa he, ghaziabad or alvar main dikh rahaa he
 The mob shoots, surrounds Rakbar and kills him
 police pahunch kar bhi rakabar ko ghumaati rah jaati he or aadmi se pehle gaay bachaane ke liye gumti rah jaati he
 a year ago there was so much debate about the killing of Pehlu Khan, there should have been some change in the functioning of the police
 rakabar khan se pehle 20 july ko bhi bheed ne ek trek dryver ko utaar kar maaraa tha
 This means that the crowd in Alwar is now permanent
 hamaari sahyogi nimisha jaisawal ne hashim trek dryver se baat kii
 Hashim also lodged a police complaint regarding the assault with him, but nothing has happened so far
 hashim akelaa kamaane vaala he or jab vah ghar se nahin nikal saktaa to sochie uski aarthik sthiti kya hogi
 Even when there is no uproar, is the police ready to act strictly in such cases, if it remains, what is its result
 alvar main is belgaum bheed ke peeche gambhirtha se jaanch honi chahie
 This means that everything is not happening suddenly and coincidentally
 rakabar ko gau taskar bataane kaa prayaas chal rahaa he
 Like the law has given the right to kill the mob for this reason
 sthaneey vakil mohammad isharq ne bataaya he ki rakabar par gau taskari kaa koi maamla darj nahin he
 Rakbar's family has denied such earlier allegations
 vakil isharak kaa kahana he ki cese tha magar akbar ke khilaaf tha
 Nimisha went to Kolgaon village of Rakbar
 vahaan jaakar parivaar kaa haal dekha
 Due to this Hindu Muslim debate, it is necessary to go to Rakbar's house to know how the poor people are getting wrapped up
 garibi ko samajhane ke liye or is hinsa ke parinaam ko samajhane ke liye
 Rakbar's wife is insensible due to shock
 chalane phirane kii haalat main nahin he
 She can neither get up and shout nor fight for the justice of her husband
 rakabar ke saat bachche hai
 28 year old Rakbar was running a family of 11 people
 pathar katata tha or doodh bechata tha
 Been saving money for a long time so that the cow could buy it
 50,000 lekar khanpur gaya tha, do gaay kareedne
 Apart from working as a laborer, he was living by selling milk
 vah paidal lekar aa rahaa tha taaki paise batch jate
 Nimisha went to the aspect of 60 km from here to the house of Aspect Khan, who was killed by the mob in April last year
 pahalu khan ko maarane waalon kaa aaj tak pataa nahin chalaa
 Those who were caught were acquitted and the case against them has been closed
 pahalu ke donon bete bel par baahar hai kyonki in par gau taskari kaa maamla darj ho gaya he
 Aspect lives by selling milk to a family of ten
 gaayen bhi thim magar bech di kyonki ab dar lagata he kab kya musiibat aa jaae
 While waiting for justice, the son of Aspect Khan has now understood that only waiting for justice can be done, cannot be found
 rakabar kii maut ne is parivaar ko phir se daraa diya he
 They know the meaning of this fear
 rakabar kii postmortem report aa gai he
 This report has revealed that Rakbar's lungs had contracted
 chot kii vajah bheetar bheetar khun kaaphi bah gaya tha
 Due to shock, his body went into hyper tension and due to lack of oxygen, the body parts started failing
 postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki vakt par aspataal le jaaya jaataa to rakabar kii jaan batch sakati thi
 It is not surprising that such a mistake would be made by the police ye police kii basic training kaa hissaa hota he ki koi ghayal he to turant aspataal le janaa he
 Even after this, the police continued to drink tea and save the cow
 suspend kiye gaye eesai mohan singh kaa ek video saamne aayaa he
 He does not know anyone is saying that a mistake has been made, forgive or punish
 eesai mohan singh ke galati maanane se baat khatm nahin ho jaati he
 There should be an investigation that between 12
30 am and 4 am, whose call was received on his phone, was an MLA calling, someone worker calling, was Mohan Singh in touch with his superiors It was, then at what time and with which officer i came in contact
 tab jaakar mohan singh kii galati kaa sahi nakshaa saamne aa sakegaa
 However, the high-level committee of police admitted in a day that there was a mistake
 gambhir chook hui he
 If Harsha Kumari Singh had not reached every aspect related to the occasion, would there have been such swift action in this case, the answer would be from what the police did in the case of assault on July 20 with Hashim
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ne bhi ghatnasthal kaa daura kiya he
 The comments ection kaise hoga, iskaa sidhaa matlab is baat se jaataa he ki kya hamaari police raajnneetik dabaavon se mukt he
 The answer lies with the Supreme Court, which gave similar clear guidelines for police reform ten years ago, such as what the police have to do in case of congestion
 police agar satta kii hawa ko nahin samajhati to phir aap hi bataaiye ki jis din supreme court ne bheed kii hinsa ko lekar disha nirdesh tay kiya usee din jharkhand ke pakur main swaami agnivesh ko bheed ne kis tarah se maaraa
 Now if you do not want to see the ideology of the crowd even by their attire, then you should get Padma Shri of this tolerance
 chah din ho gaye magar swaami agnivesh ko maarane vaali is bheed main se koi giraftaar nahin hua he
 While the police can clearly identify from this video recording
 exiaar main prasann mishra, anand tiwari, pintu mandal, ke naam hai
 Media report has stated that Prasanna Mishra is the President of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha
 anand tiwari bhaajapa ke kisaan morcha ke sadsy hai
 Pintu Mandal is the local convenor of the Bajrang Dal
 ashok kumaar ward parshad hai
 Are arrests not being made due to these people being associated with BJP and Sangh
 indian express ke prashanth pandey ne likhaa he ki exiaar main namjad aath logon kaa sidhaa sabandh bhartiya janata party, uski yuva shakha bhartiya janata yuva morcha or aresas se he
 Obviously, this crowd is not being created in the void, coming from somewhere
 agar police khud se bhi kaam nahin karegi, sawaal uthaane par bhi kaam nahin karegi, supreme court ke guideline ke baad bhi kaam nahin karegi to phir insaaf kaa bharosa kaise paidaa hoga
 Has the crowd become bigger than the Supreme Court and the police
 pashchim bengal ke jalpaigudi se baccha chori ke andeh par chaar auraton ko peetane or do ko nanga kar ghumaane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 This incident also happened on Monday
 police ne maukey par pahunch kar bachaaya na hota to bheed inke saath kya karti, bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 These four women went to the Daukimari market
 do auraten micro finans company chali gayi or ek apane sambandhi ke paas or ek kapadaa bechney nikal gai
 Till then someone made a cry that the child thieves had come
 bas turant bheed jamaa ho gai or auraton ko maarane lagi
 Two women were stripped of their clothes
 phir unhen local club main le jaaya gaya
 In the same area, a woman was beaten with a pillar a week ago
 beete shanivaar kii raat madhyapradesh ke singrauli main maansik rup se biimaar ek mahila ko baccha chor bataakar maar diya gaya
 This is your India of today
 vaise ham log stri ko devi bhi maanate hai, shaayad duniya ke kisi bhi desh main stri ko na devi maanate hai or na stri maanate honge, ye kam badi baat nahin he ki ham devi maanate hai
 Hashim is a lone earner and when he cannot get out of the house, imagine what his financial condition will be
 jab hangaamaa nahin hota he tab bhi kya police aise maamalon main sakhti se kaam karne ke liye tatpar rahati he, agar rahati he to uskaa kya riselt he
 This unruly mob in Alwar must be seriously investigated
 iskaa matlab he ki sabakuch achaanak or sanyog se nahin ho rahaa he
 Efforts are on to make Rakbar a cow smuggler
 jaise bheed ko is kaaran se maar dene kaa kanoon ne adhikaar diya ho
 Local lawyer Mohammad Isharq has said that there is no case of cow smuggling registered on Rakbar
 rakabar ke parivaar waalon ne is tarah ke pehle ke aarope se inkaar kiya he
 Lawyer Isharak says that the case was there but was against Akbar
 nimisha rakabar ke gaanv kolgav gayi
 Go there and see the condition of the family
 is hindu muslim dibet ke kaaran garib log kis tarah lapete main aa rahe hai yah jaanane ke liye rakabar ke ghar janaa zaruri he
 To understand poverty and to understand the consequences of this violence
 rakabar kii patni sadame ke kaaran besudh he
 It is not in a condition to move
 vah uthakar na to chilla sakati he or na apane pati ke insaaf ke liye lard sakati he
 Rakbar has seven children
 28 saal kaa rakabar 11 logon kaa parivaar chalaa rahaa tha
 Used to cut stones and sell milk
 bahut dinon se paise bachaa rahaa tha taaki gaay kareed sake
 50,000 went to Khanpur to buy two cows
 mazaduri karne ke alaava vah doodh bechakar guzaaraa kar rahaa tha
 He was coming on foot so that money would be saved
 nimisha yahaan se 60 kimi dur pahalu khan ke ghar gayi jise pichley saal april main bheed ne maar diya tha
 The people who killed aspect Khan have not been found till date
 jinhen pakadaa gaya tha, ve bari ho gaye or unke khilaaf cese band ho chukaa he
 Both the sons of Aspect are out on the vine as a case of cow smuggling has been registered
 pahalu kaa das logon ke parivaar kaa doodh bechakar guzaaraa chalata he
 There were also cows but sold them because now i am afraid when the trouble comes
 insaaf ke intazaar main pahalu khan kaa betaa ab samaj gaya he ki insaaf kaa sirf intazaar hi kiya ja saktaa he, paaya nahin ja saktaa he
 Rakbar's death scares the family again
 ve jaanate hai is dar kaa matlab
 Rakbar's postmortem report has arrived
 is report main yah baat saamne ai he ki rakabar ke fefde main sikudan aa gai thi
 Due to the injury, the internal blood was drained

 The post-mortem report said that Rakbar's life could have been saved had he been taken to the hospital on time

 rakabar kii postmortem report aa gai he
 This report has revealed that Rakbar's lungs had contracted

 Due to shock, his body went into hyper tension and due to lack of oxygen, the body parts started failing
 postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki vakt par aspataal le jaaya jaataa to rakabar kii jaan batch sakati thi
 It is not surprising that such a mistake would be made by the police ye police kii basic training kaa hissaa hota he ki koi ghayal he to turant aspataal le janaa he
 Even after this, the police continued to drink tea and save the cow

 He does not know anyone is saying that a mistake has been made, forgive or punish
 eesai mohan singh ke galati maanane se baat khatm nahin ho jaati he
 There should be a proper investigation, between whom the phone was received on his phone between twelve o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the morning, whether a legislator was calling, a worker was calling, was Mohan Singh in touch with his superiors It was, then at what time and with which officer i came in contact
 tab jaakar mohan singh kii galati kaa sahi nakshaa saamne aa sakegaa
 However, the high-level committee of police admitted in a day that there was a mistake

 The answer lies with the Supreme Court, which gave similar clear guidelines for police reform ten years ago, such as what the police have to do in case of congestion
 police agar satta kii hawa ko nahin samajhati to phir aap hi bataaiye ki jis din supreme court ne bheed kii hinsa ko lekar disha nirdesh tay kiya usee din jharkhand ke pakur main swaami agnivesh ko bheed ne kis tarah se maaraa
 Now if you do not want to see the ideology of the crowd even by their attire, then you should get Padma Shri of this tolerance

 lekin yuvak ne pankhe kii jad se dur jane kaa hawala dete hue seat par jagah dene se manaa kar diya
 After this, both of them somehow sat close together in a tight space
 shuru main to premi jode or yuvak ke bich maamuli kahasuni hui, lekin sthiti shantipurna hi rahi
 But when the train went ahead and boarded some more passengers in the bogie, a young man who was riding later started tightening up with the loving couple

 Somehow we sat on a small space left on the seat
 lekin duusari savaariyaan ham par chillane lageen ki yah mahilaon kii bogi nahin he or mujhe mahilaon kii bogi main jane ke liye kehane lageen
 But the illiterate probably do not know that it was a simple box, which is not just for men
 aakhirkaar hamen seat chhodkar uthanaa padaa
 We sat on the other seat
 lekin jis vyakti ne hamen pankhe ke chalate seat par jagah dene se manaa kar diya tha, vah ab hamaare paas aakar baith gaya
 At this i asked him 'kaku, now how have you left your seat? Can't you feel the heat now? ”to this he said that go home and sit on each other's lap
 ek anya sawari ne kaha- aap jaise logon ke chalate hi kolkata metro vaali ghatana hui thi
 The third ride says - do not board the train in such clothes

 isi ke tahat party ne nikaay chunaavon main apane ab tak kii vichaardhaara or tevar se itar record sankhya main muslim pratyaashiyon ko maidan main utaara he
 According to the news of an English newspaper, the party has trusted over 500 Muslim candidates in the 8,434-member body elections
 isse pehle 2010 ke nikaay chunaav main yah sankhya 300 thi, jisamen se 250 mahilaayein thim
 This means that this time the party has given opportunity to more than 40 percent of the Muslim candidates apart from its rut
 party kii ore se niti main yah badlaav aise samay bhi kiya gaya he, jab rajya main parisemen ke baad sampradayik sameekaran badale hai
 Congress has fielded 800 Muslim candidates in the election season to compete with 800 Muslim candidates in the BJP

 If it is the matter of such poets who have made the people aware of their rights with their writing from the freedom struggle till then, then Ramdhari Singh Dinkar's name definitely comes in them
 aaj rashtrakavi ramdhaari singh dinakar kii 106 veen jayanti he
 Dinkar was born on 23 September 1908 in Simaria village of Begusarai district, Bihar
 teen saal kii umr main sir se pita kaa saaya uth jane ke kaaran unka bachapan abhaavon main beetaa
 But the daily recitation of Ramcharitmanas at home sowed the seeds of poetry and his understanding within Dinkar
 unki pehali rachana 'pranbhang' maani jaati he
 He wrote it in 1928
 iske baad dinakar ne 'renuka', 'hunkaar', 'kurukshetra', 'baapu', 'rashmirathi' likhaa
 In 'renuka' and 'hunkar', patriotism was so full that the British banned these books by being nervous
 dinakar ne nirbhik hokar angrejon ke khilaaf to likhaa hi, lekin aazaadee ke baad ke satta charitra ko bhi ujagar karne se nahin hichake
 Dinkar was among Jawaharlal Nehru's admirers
 lekin 1962 ke yuddh main sainikon kii maut ke mudde par vah nehru kii aalochana se bhi nahin chuke
 In 'waiting for Parasurama', he writes, it is fatal, which looks god-like, but, in the room, writes the wrong order, the sinner who does not have the virtue; Gotra is cute, understand, he has killed us here
 yaad rahe ki dinakar kii mashhoor kitaab 'samskruti ke chaar adhyay' kii bhoomika jawahar laal nehru ne hi likhi thi
 Dinkar was also a member of the Rajya Sabha
 kitaab 'urvashi' ke liye unhen gyanpith puraskaar bhi diya gaya
 From this book, Dinkar proved that apart from Veer Ras, he can also write Shringar
 dinakar bhale hi kavi ke rup main zyada mashhoor hon lekin unka gadhy bhi majboot tha
 His prose compositions include 'four Chapters of Culture' besides 'clay Towards', 'ardhanarishwar', 'reti Ke Phool', 'hey Ram' and 'lokdev Nehru'
 dinakar ne hindi kavita ko chhayavaad ke baaripan se mukti dilaakar use aam janata ke bich pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 This is the reason why even today, Dinkar's poetry remains on people's tongues
 dinakar ne mukhya rup se vir ras kii kavita likhi he jisamen samaaj ke dalit, peedit or shoshakon ko pramukhataa se jagah diya gaya he
 Dinkar Taumr remained against caste and writing for it as well as running a social movement
 unke gaanv vaale bataate hai ki dinakar ne jati vyavastha ke khilaaf ek andolan apane gaanv main laddu baantkar kiya tha
 The protagonist of his book 'rashmirathi' may be Karna of Mahabharata, but in the backdrop of this is shown the same discrimination of caste system which he felt around him
 dinakar ke liye gaanv se rashtrakavi banane kii raah aasaan nahin thi
 He worked from a teacher to a professor
 unhone bie to itihaas main kiya tha magar taumr hindi ke shikshak rahe
 He was also the Vice Chancellor of Bhagalpur University
 bhale hi dinakar jivan-bhar gaanv se baahar rahe magar vah apane gaanv ko kabhi nahin bhuule
 Recalling her village, she wrote, o Janani Janmabhoomi Satbar Namanatuzh Sa Na Simaria Ghat Anyadinakar had made a deep observation of the condition of women in her village and found that women are far behind than men due to lack of education
 unhone apane gaanv main kanya awasiya vidhyalay ke naam se ek skool kholaa
 Dinkar was so dedicated to doing this work that he donated his land to build this school
 philhal yah skool khandhar ban chukaa he
 Ironically, like the village of other poets in India, Dinkar's village is living in a state of disrepair
 simriya gaanv main dinakar ko samarpit sabhaagaar ke naam par sirf ek chat khadi kar di gai he, jo kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Every year, the Bihar government makes several announcements in the name of Dinkar, but the work of his memorial remains incomplete till date

 This silence is about the fate of Abu Salem
 1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaake ke aaropee salem par aaj vishesh tada adaalat sunwaayee kar rahi he
 The special TADA court has framed charges against him, but Monday has been fixed for sentencing
 aise main aaj tak ke samvaadadaata ne salem ke gaanv jaakar vahaan ke logon se ise lekar baat kii
 The family did not say that the house of Abu Salem was completely deserted
 reporter ne ghar kaa darwaja khat-khataya
 a girl came from inside the house, looking very frightened
 usne kaha ki ghar ke andar koi nahin he
 Said that no one from the house wants to talk to the press
 uske ghar ke paas hi ek masjid he, jahaan thodaa kolahal dikh rahaa tha
 People were gathering for Namaz at that time
 namaaj khatm hone ke baad aaj tak kii team par log shaq bhari najaron se dekhne lagen
 When he reached there, people said in unison that Abu Salem is innocent
 logon kaa kahana tha ki use sajeesh ke tahat fansaaya ja rahaa he
 No one was aware of how Salem reached Portugal
 jiske baad use bharat laayaa gaya tha
 There was no case against Salem in the area, Mohammad Asif, a neighbor of Abu Salem, said that 'abu Salem is innocent
 uske khilaaf sajeesh hui he
 We are just hoping that someday the truth will come out
 ' vahiin ek duusare padosi abu ubaid kaa kahana tha ki 'is puure ilaake main abu salem ke khilaaf ek bhi cese nahin he
 You go and ask the police station
 is ilaake main hindu or muslim saath-saath rahete hai or abhi tak ek bhi danga nahin hua he
 i believe there is a conspiracy against him
 'sabaki madadke liye rahata tha taiyaadbu salem ke parivaar ke logon ne press se baat karne main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 There was only an indifferent peace among the family on this whole matter
 vahiin salem ke padosi is pure mudde par uske or uske parivaar waalon ke saath dikhen
 Most people do not know anything about what Abu Salem used to do in Mumbai
 salem ko log tarah-tarah kaa kaam kar sakane vaala or sabaki madad ke liye tauyar rahane vaale insaan ke rup main jaanate hai
 Investigations and evidence against Abu Salem were questioned by many youths
 un logon ne is ore ishaara kiya ki kisi par iljaam lagaana or uske khilaaf saboot ikkatha karnaa police ke liye bahut aasaan he
 Mohammad Uber has also indicated that if the family members agree to go to higher courts, then the people of the neighborhood will stand with him

 The committee said in its report, 'as far as the crypto currency of the private sector is concerned, in view of the risks associated with them and their price fluctuations, the committee has recommended banning crypto currency in India and in India It is also recommended to impose a fine and fine for those conducting any activity related to crypto currency
 iemasi ne krypto karency maamalon aage vichaar ke liye ek sthaayee samiti bhi banane kii sifarish kii he
 The committee considered all digital rupees, or digital foreign currency, to be bankable crypto currencies, which are not being operated under the Reserve Bank's regulations
 samiti ne kaha ki krypto karency se kisi bhi tarah se mudra kaa uddeshy puraa nahin hota or kisi bhi desh main inhen kanoonee vaidhata hasil nahin he
 The government constituted this inter-ministerial committee in November 2017 to look into issues related to crypto currency
 kya he digital yaa krypto karency?krypto karency ek aisi mudra he jo computer elgoridm par bani hoti he
 It is an independent currency that has no owner
 yah karency kisi bhi ek athurity ke kaabo main bhi nahin hoti
 Digital or crypto currencies are a virtual currency operating on the Internet
 internet par is virtual karency kii shuruyaat janvari 2009 main bitcoin ke naam se hui thi
 Using this virtual currency, a person can be paid in any corner of the world and most importantly, there is no need to make any bank a medium for this payment

 i was going to Dehradun with him (rajiv) to attend the 50th Foundation Day celebrations of Doon School
 hawaii jahaaj main maine madi martin kii pustak padhi jisamen likhaa tha ki jab rajeev ke naanaa or tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru unase milane doon skool pahunche tab skool main rajeev kaa kahin atapata nahin tha
 Iyer said that everyone was very worried, people started searching for Rajiv, then someone found that this little child is hiding in a basket of dirty clothes in the school bathroom
 pustak main likhaa tha ki sankochi swabhaav ke hone kii vahaj se rajeev ne aisa kiya
 Iyer said that he was supposed to meet Rajiv Gandhi at four o'clock in the evening of the Doon School to finalize his speech
 ‘maine rajeev gandhi se pustak kii is ghatana ke bare main poocha ki kya yah sach he
 Rajeev said that yes, this is the right incident but the reason for it (hiding) is another
 ’unhone kaha ki iske baad samaaroh main rajeev gandhi ne apane bhaashan main is ghatana kaa zikr kiya
 Iyer said that Rajiv told about the incident that the reason for his hiding in the school bathroom was not that he was hesitant to face his maternal grandfather and the Prime Minister or that he wanted to stay away from politics
 unhone kaha, ‘rajeev ne mujhase kaha ki jab kabhi vah apane mitron ke samaksh pandit nehru ke paksh main bolte the to dost kehete the ki naanaa kii baat bolta he, or jab kabhi koi vipareet baat kehete the tab dost kaha karte the ki itane bade or gyani aadmi ke vipareet bol rahaa he
 Iyer said that Rajiv said that this is why he did not say anything for a long time
 shaayad yaheen kaaran he ki jab paristhitivash pradhanmantri bana tab jitani bhi soch man main thi, use vyakt kiya or pradhanmantri ke rup main apane kaaryo main ise vyakt kiya
 He said that when Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister, he had no preparations, no one knew about his potential but this young man of 40 years became the Prime Minister of the country, then people were surprised that the person who has never been interested in politics He showed the country and the world in a few months with new thinking and new agenda

 kaashi ko itihaas or paramparaon se bhi pracheen kaha jaataa he
 Famous writer Mark Twain writes, "banaras is also antiquated by history, older than traditions, older than legends, and when collected, is twice as old as that collection
 "kala, samskruti or dharm ke adbhut sangam ke chalatekashihajaron saal se desh kaa saanskrithik or dharmik centre rahaa he
 This is the reason why the message emanating from Kashi has great importance in the whole country and especially in North India
 pradhanmantrinarendra modine yun hi nahin kaashi ko 2014 main apane sansadeey kshetra ke rup main chunaa, balki wo jaanate the ki yadi kaashi sadh gaya to sabase zyada siton vaala uttar pradesh sadh jayega or upi sadh gaya to puraa desh sadh jayega
 On April 24, 2014, after filling the form from Kashi, Narendra Modi said, "
 
 Neither anyone has sent me, nor have i come here, Togangaman has called me
 "unheen ganga maa kaa aashirwad praapt kar prachand bahumat ke saath narendra modi kaashi ke saansad or desh ke pradhanmantri bane chaar saal guzar gaye
 PM Modi will be with Kashivasi on his birthday on Monday
 in chaar saal main kaashi ko yun to kai yojanaayen milin
 In which there is also the insistence to give Kashi the appearance of Kyoto, the religious city of Japan and the passion to build a smart city
 to vahiin desh kaa sabase svachh shahar banane kaa swapn bhi he
 There are about 24000 crore projects of development in Kashi and its surrounding areas
 saath hi hriday yojana ke tahat yahaan kii dharoharon, aitihaasik smarakon ke sangrakshan or sanvardhan kaa kaam bhi teji se chal rahaa he
 Let's take a look at what PM Modi gave through Kashi in the last few years
 kaashi ko kioto bananapradhanmantri narendra modi kii jid kaashi ko japan ke dharmik nagar kioto jaisaa banane kii he
 For this, PM Modi himself went to Japan, talked to PM Shinzo Abe of Japan
 jiske baad shinjo abe banaras aae or donon deshon ke rashtradhyakshon ne rajendra prasad ghat par pandit channulaal mishra ke gayan ke bich ganga aarti kaa lutf uthaaya or kaashi ko svachh or sundar banane ke liye donon deshon ke bich qaraar hua
 This was followed by a team of experts from Japan to Benares
 yah baat alag he ki vikaas or samskruti ke sangharsh kii vajah se japan kii team auravaranasinagar nigam, varanasi prashasan ke bich talmail nahin baith paaya
 Due to which, the pace of making Kashi to Kyoto slowed down in four years and no effective steps could be taken in this direction
 gyanpith puraskaar se sammanit lekhak kashinath singh kaa 'ajtak' se baatcheet main kahana he ki kaashi main dharm or samskruti donon kaa mahatv he, lekin pichley chaar saal main sarkaar kaa puraa dhyaan dharm par rahaa or samskruti kahin peeche chhot gai
 Kashinath says that the entire focus of the government remained on the Vishwanath Corridor, while other heritage related to the culture of Banaras fell to this corridor
 bunakaron ke liye hastkala sankulakashi kshetra main parampara se hi shilp kaa gyaan he yahi vajah he ki yahaan ke aath utpaadon ko jiaai yani jeeographical indication ko bauddhik smapda adhikaar kaa darja hasil he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised that the products related to Banaras weavers and handicrafts will be brought to global heights, will be recognized
 jis uddeshy se varanasi ke bada lalpur main deen dayaal hastkala sankul yani trade facility centre kholaa gaya
 Through this, there is a system of purchasing weavers' goods so that their goods reach the right place at the right time and their income increases
 saath hi yah centre logon ke saath vishwa main bhi kaashi kshetra ke handloom or hastshilp ke bare main jaankaree degaa or isaki samskruti bhi sanjoe rakhega
 Eminent writer Kashinath Singh says that a select few benefited from this center
 kashinath kehete hai ki jab aap antyoday kii baat karte hai to pankti main sabase peeche khadey bunakar kaise peeche chhot sakate hai
 Campaign to build world's cleanest city PM Modi has another insistence that Kashi be the cleanest city in the world
 jiske peeche soch he ki yadi shahar svachh rahegaa to paryaton ke lihaaj se sailaaniyon kaa aakarshan badhegaa or paryaton udyog bhi falega phoolegaa
 That is why the Prime Minister started the nationwide cleanliness campaign with Kashi
 assi ghat par baadh kii mitti se pati sidhiyon par narendra modi ne khud fawda chalaaya tha or jagannatha mandir kii gali main jhaadu lagaai
 The municipal corporation and Varanasi administration took this campaign seriously
 jisaki vajah se varanasi shahar kaa naam 2018 main desh ke sabase svachh shaharon kii suchi main 29wein sthaan par pahunch gaya or soobe main rajdhani lakhanu ko peeche chhodte hue pehle sthaan par
 Kashi's ranking was 65th in 2016
 urja ganga-pradooshan mukt kashipradhanmantri modi ke dream project urja ganga kii shuruyaat 2017 main hui
 Under which the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) started the work of laying the PNG pipeline at the Diesel Rail Workshop (dereka) campus

 IPDS Project The IPDS project has started disappearing of the hanging electrical wires and their dense nets in the city

 But undergrounding the hanging electrical wires is a major challenge in the street town of Benaras
 ganga parivahan yojanaganga main elahabaad se haldiya ke bich shuru hone vaali jal parivahan yojana main kaashi ko cargo hub ke taur par viksit karne kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 For this, a multi-modal terminal is being built in Ramnagar which is now being expanded as a cargo hub
 is terminal main cargo ke alaava cold storage, bevarej house or packing kii suvidha hogi
 Once the hub is built, products from every corner of the country will reach Kashi by rail, road and waterway
 namaami gange yojana: ganga ko svachh karne kii kavayadpradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki mujhe ganga maa ne bulaayaa he
 Therefore, PM Modi's condolences about the cleanliness of Ganga are well known
 modi sarkaar main iske liye alag se mantralay kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Four years of the Modi government's ambitious Namami Gange scheme to clean the Ganga has completed, but pollution in the Ganges river in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi has increased more than before
 yah khulaasa 'ajtak' ne hi kiya tha
 Swami Avimukteshwarananda, a disciple of Shankaracharya Swaroopananda, says that the condition of the Ganges remains the same
 saundaryikaran ke naam par ghaaton par rang birangi lite laga di gayi lekin ganga sirf ghat nahin he
 It needs to be continuous to clear the Ganges
 iske saath somvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi apane janmdiwas ke din kashivasiyon ko 600 karod kii pariyojnaon kii saugat denge jisamen atal incubeshan centre, nagepur gram peyajal yojana, or vidyut sab stesan ityadi shaamil hai

 They dragged our mama with hair and set us on fire

 Allah will not give them a place in the world
 haa ammi, maine mam ko apni ankhon se jalte hue dekha
 With a burning body, she ran back and forth into the classroom and then fell

 While writing this my body is shivering to make me corpse
 maine apane doston ko shahid hote dekha
 They shot bullets in the eyes and minds of crying children

 His hijab became red with blood

 Like these Ashrar of Nida Fazli and Bashir Badr:) How will you hide these stains of blood from God, who will go to the tomb of the innocent, who will go to the mosque after getting up, Islam is left in the hands of the terrorists, the same is the crown
 Poison is the same jam, this is the land of God, it is the same system of idols, here is what is written with the blood of a child, Tera Kirtan is still a sin, now i am prostrated gandhi parivaar ne apane garh main siyaasi taur par sab hasil kiya, lekin ek malaal rahaa ki sonia gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra main wo kabhi vidhayak akhilesh singh ko nahin haraa paae
 Akhilesh Singh was once an MLA of the Congress Party, but all criminal cases were filed against Akhilesh and he was dropped from the Congress
 lekin teen baarcongresske tikat par jeetne vaale akhilesh ne baad main bataur nirdaleey or phir pis party ke ummidavaar ke taur par vidhansabha kaa chunaav raibareli kii sadar seat se jeeta
 Now sitting MLA Akhilesh has decided that he will now contest the assembly elections for his daughter in his place
 pehle basapa, espi or bijepi se unki beti ke chunaav ladane kii charchaa tej thi, lekin andarkhaane priyanka gandhi ne ahm role nibhaayaa or akhilesh kii beti aditi congress main shaamil ho gayin
 She will now contest from Rae Bareli Sadar on a Congress ticket
 akhilesh or gandhi parivaar kaa lav-het kaa rishtarayabareli main netaji or vidhayak ji ke naam se mashhoor akhilesh singh ke jalwe ke aage gandhi parivaar kaa jalawaa hameshaa feekaa rahaa
 Akhilesh, who broke away from Congress after his name cropped up in the Syed Modi murder case, once contested while in jail
 khud priyanka gandhi ne raibareli sadar vidhansabha kshetra main gum gum kar unako haraane ke liye khub prachaar kiya, lekin akhilesh bade antar se jite
 In the last election, Peace Party candidate Akhilesh launched personal attacks against Priyanka in the election campaign, but despite Priyanka's efforts, the MLA also remained the same
 vaise raibareli main priyanka ne jab satish sharma ke liye pehali baar prachaar kii kaman sanbhali, uske pehle akhilesh apane bhai ashok singh ko saansad banwaaya karte the or congress kii zamaanat zabt hua karti thi, jabaki kabhi ek jamaane main raibareli se khud indira gandhi saansad hua karti thim
 Later, when Sonia Gandhi resigned from the Lok Sabha in the matter of office of profit and fought the by-elections again, the Congress wanted to increase the margin of Sonia's victory, hence, Akhilesh was returned to the Congress by winning the honor and Sonia also won with more margin
 She went, but due to the criminal case and a domineering image, her paths with the Congress were diverted again
 akhilesh kii beti, priyanka or raibareliye baat sabhi jaanate hai ki, raibareli main akhilesh kaa apana votbank he
 They can be an important political weapon for any party
 isiilie jab unhone apni beti ko siyasat main utaarne kaa faisla kiya to har party ne un par dore daale, lekin baad main priyanka gandhi ne amethi rajgaraane ke sanjay singh ke zariye akhilesh se sampark saadhaa or videsh se padhakar lauti unki beti aditi ko congress main shaamil kara diya, jisase raibareli main akhilesh kii taaqat se congress ko or majbooti mili, saath hi apane garh main ek badi chunauti khatm ho jaye
 The special thing is that, Aditi was inducted in Delhi in the presence of Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is in charge of the Congress, which shows how much Akhilesh is in Rae Bareli
 parade ke saamne ke ye sari tasviren sabake saamne aayin, lekin aaj tak ke paas ai parade ke peeche kii wo tasviir jo priyanka kii bhoomika khudbakhud bayaan kar detii he
