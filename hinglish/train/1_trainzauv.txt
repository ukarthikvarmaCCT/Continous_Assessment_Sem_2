 The Supreme Court has asked the petitioners to approach the High Court
 supreme court ne kaha ki aadhaar maamle par pehle hoicourt kaa rukh karen
 The petition was filed in the Supreme Court by social activist Ripak Kansal and former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh
 is yachika main kaha gaya tha ki aadhaar par laayaa gaya adhyadesh loktantric prakriya ke khilaaf he
 The petition also said that the Supreme Court should overturn the judgment earlier given on grounds
 aadhaar par adhyadesh ko kendriya cabinet ne aadhaar kanoon main sanshodhan ke liye adhyadesh laane ko manjuuri di he jise sheersh aadalat main chunauti di gai thi
 Giving information about the cabinet decision, on 28 February, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said that the cabinet approved the ordinance to provide legal basis for voluntarily linking Aadhaar to mobile numbers, bank accounts
 vahiin vitt mantri arun jetali kaa kahana tha ki loksabhaa ne 4 janvari ko isse sambandhit vidheyak paarit kar diya tha, lekin vidheyak rajya sabha main pesh nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Therefore, the government is now bringing this ordinance
 in sanshodhano ke jariye aadhaar ke durupyog ko rokane or logon kii niztaa ko banaae rakhane ke liye kade praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 Aadhaar will no longer be made mandatory for the identity of a person
 supreme court main kyon di chunautiaadhar adhyadesh 2019 ko do staron par chunauti di ja sakati he
 The amendments were originally brought to Parliament through a bill that was passed in the Lok Sabha, but it could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha
 sansad satr ke khatm hone se pehle ise thos rup nahin diya ja sakaa
 Therefore, the Modi government brought an ordinance for this
 haalanki, adhyadeshon ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 123 main nirdisht sharton ko puraa kiye jane kii sthiti main main hi adhyadesh ko lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 The petitioners say that through the ordinance, the central government can abuse its power

 jab kaaphi tej bukhaar hua to rishtedaar bacchee ko lekar saket city aspataal pahunche lekin ilaaj ke dauraan hi bacchee kii maut ho gai
 At the same time, in view of the increasing cases of dengue, the Delhi government has taken an important decision to reduce the fees charged for dengue test to Rs 600
 yani kisi bhi nijee aspataal main dengue ke test ke naam par isse zyaada rupaye vasule nahin ja sakenge
 At present, more than 2000 dengue patients are admitted in different hospitals in Delhi and treatment facilities are also insufficient as there is a shortage of beds for the patients
 vahiin ab dilli sarkaar ne nijee aspataalon ko bhi teen-chaar hazaar bed badhaane ko kaha he

 At the same time, the Delhi government has also asked private hospitals to increase three to four thousand beds

 "he said," a BJP leader said that 20 Congress mlas are in touch with him
 aaj 9-10 bijepi ke vidhayak hamaare sampark main hai
 Khan's remarks came at a time when Yeddyurappa had recently said that the lifetime of this government would depend on the decision taken by the Congress's unhappy 20 mlas after the Lok Sabha elections
 jab unase bijepi ke sampark main hone vaale vidhayakon ke naamon ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'bijepi pehle to congress ke 20 vidhayakon ke naam bataae, uske baad ham bijepi ke 9 vidhayakon ke naam bataaenge
 He claimed that he would take a break from politics if the congress-janata Dal (S) government falls
 unhone chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani rahati he to bijepi ke netaaon ko bhi raajnneeti chhod deni chahie

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator In the March 4 episode of Ishqbaaz, ACP Ranveer Singh Randhawa reaches Oberoi Mansion with his mother Kamini
 kamini ko dekh shakti chaunk jaataa he, vah uske college ke dinon kaa pyaar hoti he
 Tej is very happy to see Kamini, that the drama will now be seen in the life of Pinky and Shakti
 vahiin pinki kamini se kahati he ki vah shakti se dur rahe
 Kamini talks to Shakti and Tej about college days
 duusari taraf shivaay anika ko phone par kahata he ki jaruri kaam kii vajah se use ghar se baahar janaa padaa, lekin use pataa he ki ghar par vah sabakuch sambhaal legi or kuch bhi gadabad hone nahin degi
 Here Kamini says that she likes Priyanka ever since Ranveer told her about her
 vah kahati he ki vah shagun kaa sara saamaan lekar ai he or roka karke hi jaaegi
 Tej tells him that everything is happening very quickly, he says that Roka may be later too
 is par kamini use tok detii he ki ve unhen saalon se jaanate hai
 Pointing to the power, she says that it should not be too late to add a relationship, otherwise the distance increases
 is par anika kahati he ki unhen roka ke liye shivaay ke aane tak kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 Rudra also says that without Shivaay there cannot be a ritual of stopping
 rudra shivaay ko phone karata he, duusari taraf phone kii taraf dekhte hue shivaay kaa dhyaan car se hatane kii vajah se car kaa balance bighad jaataa he or uski car sadak par so rahe kuch logon ke upar se guzar jaati he
 This makes him quite afraid and comes to the people who get out of the car, though he then realizes that he is the setup of shooting a film
 haalanki koi is puri ghatana ko phone par record kar rahaa hota taaki shivaay ko kisi sajeesh main fansaa sake
 The comments duusari taraf sahil bangalore trip se ghar waapas lautataa he
 Anika starts to go inside with him, so Kamini interrupts her that due to someone being disabled in the auspicious work, she is sad, she tells Sahil to get out of the house
 ranvir kamini ko roktaa he par vah us par hi naaraaz ho jaati he
 She pushes Sahil to evict him, calling him ill-fated
 isse sahil neeche gir jaataa he, ghar se sabhi logon ko kamini kaa bartaav ajeeb lagata he
 After this, Anika stops Kamini and says that Sahil is her brother and if she takes another step towards him, then there will be no worse than that
 kamini or anika ke bich hathapayee ho jaati he, anika ke dhakke se kamini neeche gir jaati he
 She hurts herself by hitting her head on the table
 iske baad vah oberoi parivaar se kahati he ki vah unki tarah amir nahin he lekin is beijjati ko vah kabhi nahin bhuulegi
 Tej asks Anika to apologize to Kamini
 lekin anika kahati he ki uski koi galati nahin he
 Angered by this, Kamini starts leaving from there, Shivaay tries to stop them by reaching there
 kamini kii bevajaah kii jid se priyanka ko gussa aa jaataa he, vah unhen jane ke liye kahati he, or kahati he use bheekh main mila rishta nahin chahie
 In tomorrow's episode we will see that Daksha (shivaay's childhood friend and Anika's psycho lover whom Anika was engaged to) is actually ACP Randhawa's elder brother and he has returned to the Oberoi family's life for revenge
 
 idhar kamini kahati he ki use priyanka tabase pasand he jabase ranvir ne use uske bare main bataaya tha
 She says that she has brought all the items of the omen and will be stopped
 tej usase kahata he ki sabakuch bahut hi jaldi ho rahaa he, vah kahata he ki roka baad main bhi ho saktaa he
 Kamini interrupts him knowing that he has known her for years
 vah shakti kii taraf ishaara karte hue kahati he ki rishte jodne main zyada der nahin kerani chahie nahin to dooriyaan bad jaati hai
 Anika says that they should wait till Shivaay arrives for Roka
 rudra bhi kahata he ki shivaay ke bina roke kii rasm nahin ho sakati
 Rudra calls Shivaay, looking at the phone on the other side, Shivaay's attention shifts from the car as the balance of the car deteriorates and his car passes over some people sleeping on the road

 Due to the closure of old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees and due to less circulation of new notes, people are having trouble of cash
 logon kii ummid thi ki 30 disambar ke baad halaat saamaanya ho jaaenge
 But according to the news, even after the 50-day ultimatum that is being completed on December 30, there is no hope of relief on cash withdrawals, that is, in the new year, there is hardly any possibility of reduction in queues of people outside banks and atms
 Huh
 sutron kii maane to bank or atm se simit cash nikaalane kii pabandi 30 disambar ke baad bhi jari rahegaa

 People are worried about the cash that many big cities including Delhi still have huge complaints about the cash

 At the same time, the opposition is constantly attacking PM Modi and the central government for demonetisation

 media main kai baar aisi reports aati rahi hai ki gambhir or dhoni ke bich sambandh madhur nahin hai
 Dhoni's film 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story' features young talented actor Sushant Singh Rajput from Hindi films
 yah film 30 sitambar ko relies ho rahi he
 Many people also took a dig at Gambhir for this tweet on social media
 kuch yugers kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki dhoni ke prati apni naaraazgi ke kaaran gambhir ne yah twit kiya he
 However, Gambhir came to the rescue of his tweet when the matter was shown to be increasing

 diarector alankruta shrivastav kii film 'lipstick under maai burka' mahilaon kii aakankshaon kii kahani kahati he, phir chaahe wo kisi bhi umr, dharm yaa samaaj kii hon
 In this film, the story of a woman's entire life is told by four characters who are at different stages of age

 In this film, Rihanna (palabita Borthakur) wants to liberate her dreams and desires from the shackles of family traditions, imprisoned in the burqa, on the other hand, Leela (aahana Kumra) runs a beauty parlor, but her dreams come from the narrow streets of Bhopal Want to leave film kii khaamiyon kii baat karen to, main ise filmkaar kii nahin, balki samay kii kami maanata hum kyonki is tarah ke vishay par pehle bhi filmein ban chuki hai or jo haal hi kii film mujhe yaad aati he, vah he 'parcht'
 In comparison, even in that film, the soul of the story was similar to 'lipstick Under My Burka', but every filmmaker has the right to tell his own story in his own way, but as a critic, it becomes difficult for me to not have that much newness about the subject
 Think
 iske alaava film kii duusari kami he film main interwel ke baad kaa thodaa sa hissaa, jahaan film kii kahani kii gati kam ho jaati he
 Apart from this, if you look at this film, it tells the story of only one section of the society ie middle class or lower middle class

 isamen sachin tendulkar, mitali raaj, olympic para athlete raagini sharma, antarrashtriya para tairaak rashmi jha ne hissaa liya
 On this occasion, all the stars who came from different sports gave experiences about the participation of girls in sports
 unicef ke sadbhaavna doot sachin tendulkar ne kaha, 'mere jivan kii uplabdhiyaan mere mata-pita or parijanon se prerit he
 Who helped me from childhood as well as promoting my talent
 sabhi ko apni betiyon ko anmol samajhnaa chahie
 They need to understand that as a person, instead of marrying daughters quickly as a burden, daughters should be made self-supporting and able to contribute to society
 iske liye betiyon par nivesh karne kii aavashyaktaa he, jaisaa ki bharat sarkaar kar rahi he
 We should reduce the financial burden from the heads of parents, so that girls can complete their education and take steps according to their abilities in the society and fulfill their aspirations

 jammu or kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti kii ore se rakhi gai ekatarfa sijafire kii maang ko jahaan centre se hari jhandi milane ke asaar naa ke baraabar he, vahiin sutron ke mutabik surakshabalon kii leadership bhi is tarah kaa koi kadam uthaane ke haq main nahin he
 Mehbooba Mufti said on Wednesday that the Center should consider a unilateral ceasefire from the beginning of Ramadan in mid-may to the completion of the Amarnath Yatra in August
 mahabuuba kii is maang se jammu-kashmir sarkaar main sahyogi party bijepi hi ittefaq nahin rakhti
 In fact, in the valley, the attack of stone-pelts sometimes results in death of the tourists and sometimes school children are targeted on the bus
 sena ke oparations main bhi aae din patharbaz baadha daalate rahete hai
 The army has carried out a major campaign against the terrorists in the valley
 sena ke parakram ke aage aatankiyon ke hausale post hai
 In such a situation, the demand of unilateral ceasefire by Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti is neither embracing the Center nor the security establishments
 ram madhav ne sijafire shabd par jataai aapattibijapi ke mahasachiv ram madhav kaa kahana he ki centre kii ore se dineshwar sharma ko pehle se hi jammu or kashmir main icchhuk pakshon se baat karne ke liye niyukt kiya hua he
 Ram Madhav also made it clear that as far as terrorists are concerned, we should deal with them strictly
 unke mutabik bharat sarkaar ko abhi tak koi aupchaarik prastaav nahin mila he
 Ram Madhav objected to the word ceasefire
 ram madhav ne kaha, ‘hamen aisi sthiti main sijafire jaise shabd kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Ram Madhav said, if the terrorists stay away from their activities in Ramadan, if the militancy stops then the operations of the security forces will stop automatically
 surakshabalon kii duty he ki ve logon kii suraksha karen
 'let me tell you that Mehbooba Mufti had demanded unilateral ceasefire in the all-party meeting on Wednesday
 grih mantralay ko aisa koi prastaav nahin mila : rajnathkendriya grih mantri rajnath singh kaa kahana he ki abhi tak unke mantralay ko aisa koi prastaav nahin mila he, lekin ve is mudde ko jammu kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ke saamne uthaaenge
 The Jammu and Kashmir unit of the BJP has described Mehbooba Mufti's demand as 'beyond discretion'
 aatank virdohi oparation sthagit karne ke haq main nahin suraksha balis bich, jammu or kashmir sarkaar ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki likhit prastaav kii sambhaavna kam hi he kyonki ye pahal raajnneetik str par kii gai
 According to sources, the leadership of the security forces is also not entitled to accept the demand of Mehbooba Mufti
 sutron ne bataaya ki sena yaa suraksha pratishthan kisi bhi sijafire ke paksh main nahin hai
 Nor is he in favor of postponing operations against terrorists
 sijafire se aatankiyon ko sir uthaane kaa milegaa maukasutron kaa kahana he ki ghati menlashkar-e-taiyaba, jaish-e-mohammad, hijbul mujahidin jaise antkavaadi sanghathan is vakt bina kisi prabhavi leadership ke hai or baari dabaav main hai
 The continuous operation and pro-active stand of security forces near the loc has broken the back of terrorist organizations in the Valley
 in aatanki sanghathanon ke bache khuche sargana bhi idhar udhar bhaagate phir rahe hai
 Sources also say that there is constant information about the movement of terrorists from the local citizens as well
 isse pataa chalata he ki ghati ke aam log aatankwaad or hinsa se tang aa chuke hai
 According to sources, if any action is taken at this time to suspend the operation of the security forces or a ceasefire, then it will benefit the terrorist organizations only
 sutron kii ore se 2016 kii ghatnaon kaa bhi hawala diya jaataa he
 Then there were massive protests in the valley after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani
 tab focus aatankwaad virdohi oparations se hataa kar lau and order kii duty kii ore modana padaa tha
 This gave terrorist organizations a chance to raise their heads again
 iske baad suraksha balon ko dobaaraa sthiti par kaabo paane main kai maheene kaa samay laga tha
 Sources also say that Mehbooba Mufti has demanded a ceasefire, but has not clarified anything more about its conditions etc
 badi raajnneetik pahal ke bina sijafire se jammu kashmir kii sthiti main fark nahin aayega
 The Anusasutra is not good, it is also said that the experience of postponing operations or ceasefire in the valley in the past has not been good
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke pradhanmantri rahete samay sijafire yaa ‘combet oparations kii pahal nahin’ (NICO) kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 It was in force from December 1999 to March 2000 on behalf of the army and security forces
 us vakt bhi sena ko hataaya nahin gaya tha, sirf gheraabandi or search oparation ko sthagit kiya gaya tha
 But that initiative failed because the terrorists carried out attacks in many places including Srinagar Airport
 har maheene ausatan 48 ladke hote hai aatanki sanghathanon main shamilsutron ne aankadon ke saath ghati main aatankwaad kii sthiti ko bataaya
 According to sources, since the beginning of 2018, on an average every month 48 local boys join terrorist organizations
 iske alaava 22 sthaneey ladke laapata he
 They are also expected to join terrorist organizations
 surakshabal unhen waapas mukhyadhara main laane ke uddeshy se talash kar rahe hai
 But they will be taken into the mainstream only if they have not participated in any terrorist activity
 sutron ne bataaya ki ek anumaan ke mutabik 70 videshi aatankwaadi ab ghati main chupe hue hai
 The new boys who have been included in terrorist organizations are not trained
 isliye suraksha balon ko un par kaabo paane main adhik dikkat nahin aati
 If the operations of the security forces are postponed, the terrorists will get a chance to unite and organize again
 suraksha bal in dinon riyaj nikku, jinat ul islam or kuch anya aatankiyon kii talash main hai or jaldi hi un tak pahunch sakate hai
 In such a situation, the operation may be affected by the security forces postponing the operation

 Yashwant Sinha told ANI that for a long time we know that India's economy is declining
 iske liye ham pehle kii sarkaar ko dosha nahin de sakate kyonki hamen puraa mauka mila
 Has been in government for 40 months
 jiesti kaa main bhi samarthan karata hum lekin ise lagu karne main sarkaar ne jaldbaaji kii
 i am the only one except the Congress finance minister who has presented the budget 7 times
 aaj desh kii janata chaahati he ki rojgaar mili, par jisase pucho vahi kah rahaa he ki rojgaar nahin mil rahaa
 Shatrughan Sinha, who came to the rescue, told Yashwant Sinha - Tested - tested wise person yashavanth ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ke samay ham log policy paralisis kii baat karte the
 Projects worth millions of crores were stalled then
 un pariyojnaon ke liye bainkon ne lakhon karod kaa lone diya tha
 Banks' money was also snapped by the hanging of projects
 bainkon kaa 8 lakh karod fansaa he
 Problems were further exacerbated by the way GST was implemented
 1 july se jiesti lagu karnaa jaldbaazi thi
 a falling economy does not create employment
 ek jatke main desh cashles nahin ho saktaa
 Only welfare schemes do not give impetus to the economy
 gauratlab he ki purv vittamantri yashavanth sinha ne buudhvaar ko ek angreji akhbaar main lekh likhakar girti arthvyavastha ko lekar arun jetali par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Yashwant Sinha wrote that Arun Jaitley has been the biggest face in this government so far
 cabinet main naam tay hone se pehle hi unka naam tay tha ki jetali vittamantralay sanbhaalenge
 Despite losing the Lok Sabha elections, no one could stop him from becoming a minister
 sinha ne kaha ki isse pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main jaswant singh or pramod mahajan bhi vaajapeyi ke kareebi the, lekin iske baad bhi unhen mantri nahin banaaya gaya tha
 But Jaitley got the finance ministry as well as the defense ministry
 unhone likhaa tha ki pradhanmantri kaa daawa he ki unhone garibi ko kaaphi nazadik se dekha he
 His finance minister is working excessively to ensure that all Indians can see him (poverty) as closely as possible
 sinha ne kaha ki notebandi ne girti jidipi ko or kamjor karne main ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 Taking a dig, Sinha said that PM Modi says that he has seen poverty very closely, now that the way his finance minister is working, it seems that he should show poverty to all Indians
 aaj ke samay main na hi naukari mil rahi he or na hi vikaas tej ho rahaa he, jiskaa sidhaa asar investment or jidipi par padaa he
 The way the government implemented GST also has a negative impact on the economy
 jidipi abhi 5
 7 per cent, while the government changed the way it fixed GDP in 2015
 agar puraane niyamon ke hisaab se dekha jaae to aaj jidipi 3
 7 percent

 Is the announcement of Narendra Modi's name as the prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a bad news for the Muslims of India, the answer is yes
 lekin us vajah se nahin jo shaayad aap soch rahe hon
 Common beliefs about the Muslim vote bank are often proved wrong
 kyonki usamen musalamaanon ko ek aise samooh ke rup main dekha jaataa hai jo sirf dharm ke aadhaar par kisi bhi party ko vot detaa he
 In fact, Muslims vote like Hindus on the basis of issues like governance, inflation, unemployment and law and order
 lekin anubhav kahata he ki jab koi samudaay daraa hua mahasoos karata he to baaki muddon ko bhulaakar majahab ke aadhaar par hi vot detaa he
 The best example of this can be found in the way Hindus vote more than Muslims
 1990 ke dashak main bijepi ke ubhaar ke peeche hinduon kii yah dharna thi ki dharmanirpekshata ke naam par musalamaanon ko khush kiya jaataa he, isliye hinduon ko sangathit ho janaa chahie
 In 1996, the BJP received a record 20 percent of the vote
 1998 main yah aankada 25
 Had reached 6 percent
 lekin bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad jab kathith muslim tushtikaran ko lekar ubhara gussa shant ho gaya to party kaa vah vot nadaarad ho gaya
 Since then, bjp's vote has been stuck at around 19 per cent
 congress kaa vot bhi zyada ghat-bad nahin rahaa he
 His vote has been between 28 and 29 per cent for the last four elections
 lekin congress ke manager upie ke kharaab kaamkaaj ke chalate agle chunaavon ko lekar chintit hai
 However, the announcement of Modi's name has again encouraged him
 ab congress ko lagata he ki vah kaamkaaj ke aadhaar par nahin, balki modi ke mudde par chunaav lade to uskaa pradarshan ummid se kahin behatar ho saktaa he
 This is a simple math
 ab yah baat chaahe thik ho yaa nahin par musalamaanon kii badi taadaad modi par bilkul bharosa nahin karti or 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke liye unhen hi jimmedaar maanati he
 His candidacy for the post of prime minister is enough to create fear among Muslims
 congress ko lagata he ki musalamaanon main asuraksha kii yah bhaavana hi use itane vot dilaa degi ki modi ko shikast di ja sake
 The strategy of the Congress is to get this important vote
 bharat main sansadeey chunaav bahut hi kam antar se jite jate hai
 In the Hindi region, where multi-angled matches take place, the margin of victory decreases even further
 isliye agar musalmaan uske paksh main thodaa bhi jhukate hai to bijepi ko baari nuksaan ho saktaa he or congress ko phayda mil saktaa he
 But to win these votes, the Congress has to present itself as a party that can give protection to the Muslims of India
 iske saath use musalamaanon ko rijhaanaa bhi hoga
 It is true that in the last nine years of UPA rule, there has not been a serious attempt to address all the problems of minorities like unemployment, illiteracy and discrimination
 isliye congress ab sirf narebaaji or fori phaaydon ke aadhaar par hi unhen rijhaane kii ummid kar sakati he
 To do so would involve persuading clerics, making big promises (eg, reservation in jobs) and creating an environment for the religious identity of Muslims
 congress jab yah rasta akhriyaar karegi to duusari dharmanirpeksh partiyaan bhi musalamaanon ko rijhaane kii koshish main jute jaaengi
 For example, parties of Lalu Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav, who have been calling themselves the biggest advocates of Muslims
 (haalanki mujffarnagar kii hinsa ke baad musalamaanon kii pratikriya se andaja lagaaein to sapa se unka mohabhang shaayad shuru ho chukaa he
 ) Since the election manager of Narendra Modi knows that he is not going to get much support from the Muslims, he will try to create a similar Hindu wave, which benefited the BJP in 1998
 isse dharmik tanaav badhegaa or mumkin he, hinsa bhi bade
 At a time when India is facing the toughest economic crisis in two decades, our leaders will be playing Hindu and Muslim politics
 is sabake bich vaastavik nuksaan bharat ke musalamaanon kaa hoga
 Instead of being brought into the mainstream, they will be encouraged to remain minority voters
 bajaae iske ki ve baaki bharatiyon kii tarah vibhinn muddon par apana vot den, unhen dharmik aadhaar par vot dene ke liye majaboor kiya jayega
 And if violence erupts, then minorities will suffer the most

 jananath main jab mausam karavatein badal gulon main rang bhar rahaa hota he, tab bhartiya sena ke jawan kashmir main apane ghar parivaar se dur sangharsh karte hue jindagi bitaate hai
 The recently released Hyder film was widely praised and criticized for its relations with the Kashmiris and the Indian Army
 jindagi ke tamaam saal kashmir main desh kii khatir parivaar se dur rahane ke baad ek purv sainik ke man menhaidar film dekhne ke baadayah sawaal uthta he ki itane saal usne sarhad par kis desh ke liye ladaai ladi
 Because according to the soldier, the film portrayed the negative face of the Indian Army
 haidar film dekhne ke baad sena ke ek purv adhikari ne iskaa rivyuu agnivir website ke liye kiya he
 This review is going viral on social media these days
 purv sainik ne kashmir main apni tainaati ke dinon ke anubhav kii tulana haidar film kii kahani se kii he
 The story of Hyder film is from the 90s
 rivyuu karne vaale sainik bhi 90 ke daur main kashmir ghati main hi tainaat the
 Human rights violations: Ex-servicemen wrote on the website that if the highest human rights violation has occurred in the history of humanity, then they are the soldiers of the Indian Army posted in Kashmir
 beete kuch dinon se jab pakistan kii ore se lagaataar sijafire kaa ulanghan ghati main ho rahaa he
 In such a situation comes a film that presents the army fighting for the protection of people in Kashmir like a villain
 is film ko banane vaala koi videshi nahin balki ek bhartiya he
 This is very sad
 hakeekat or haidar kii kahani:kashmir kii jamini hakeekat ke bare main bataate hue sainik ne likhaa ki saurabh kaaliya 'haidar' film ke diarector or actor shahid kapur kii tarah lokapriy nahin he
 Because Saurabh was not the star of a film that worked in a film that portrayed a bad image of the country for money
 balki saurabh ne desh kii khatir apni jaan ganvaai thi
 The Pakistani army had killed five Indian Army soldiers, including Saurabh, by slicing them to death

 Soldiers eat enemy bullets: Regarding the problems faced by soldiers in the valley, the soldier wrote in the review that during deployment in Kashmir, Indian Army soldiers eat enemy bullets on the chest
 kashmir main rahane vaale parivaar sainikon ko gaali dete hai
 After watching the film, i think that who we were trying to save
 kin deshavaasiyon ko ham apana dost maan rahe the?haidar ek rashtravirohi film:purv sainik ne likhaa ki 'haidar' ek raashtra virdohi film he
 Through this, an anti-national film has been shamefully made
 purv sainik ne likhaa ki maine desh kii raksha karte hue apana ek haath ganvaaya tha jisapar mujhe fakhr he or afsos is baat kaa he ki main desh kii khatir apni jaan nahin de sakaa
 Hyder presents criminal image of army: Ex-serviceman wrote, 'army is portrayed as criminal in Haider
 film kii kahani bharat se nafrat karne vaale bashaarat pir ne likhi he
 Pir got everything from India and he continues to speak against India
 pir profeshnal film lekhak nahin hai
 But the film's team chose Pir to plot the plot of the film
 film main yah saaf sandesh diya gaya ki kashmir main aisa koi bhi insaan jo bharat kii madad karata he
 That is wrong film main haidar kaa pita doctor aantkiyon kii madad karata he
 The army arrests the doctor and kills the terrorist
 aise main haidar isi baat kaa badla lene ke liye film kii kahani main aage badhata he
 Not speaking Jai Hind wrong: Not to speak Jai Hind in the film is justified
 film ke ek seen main jab haidar kaa pita jai hind nahin bolta he, iske baad use sajaa di jaati he
 After this scene, Hyder's father talks to Irfan Khan (ruhadar) to send a message to his son for revenge
 kya jai hind bolne ke liye kahe jane ko badla lene kii tarah dekha janaa chahie
 For soldiers like us, Jai Hind is the word for which we can die and can be killed
 bhatkaati he kahani:purv sainik ne likhaa ki haidar film ke aakhir main haidar ko pakistan kii taraf jate hue dikhaaya jaataa he
 The dirty character of a Kashmiri woman is introduced in the role of Hyder's mother
 haidar puri film main bharat or sena ke khilaaf bhadakaau bhaashan detaa he
 Chutespa: In the review, the soldier wrote that the word Chutspa was used many times in the film
 jiske jariye do makasad puraa karne kii koshish kii gai
 The first film tried to spice it up using abuses
 doosraa AFSPA ko bura bataate hue chutspa ke saath tukbandi karne kii koshish kii gai
 India's right in Kashmir was outlawed by the term
 chutspa hebrew kaa shabd he
 Which is called Hutsapah (KHSUTSPAH, HUTSPAAH)
 lekin vishaal ne haidar film main is shabd kaa galat istemaal kiya
 The former soldier said about the film Hyder that i do not demand a ban on this film
 kyonki ye bain kii categiri se hatakar he
 It is a bold film
 lekin is film main thodi or boldnes kii jarurat thi
 The boldness of Pakistan shows violating the ceasefire
 rivyuu ke aakhir main sainik apil karata he ki film ko dekhne jane or apane rupee barbaad kare jane se behatar he ki kashmir main ai baadh ke baad log sena or piem raahat kosh main daan den
 Sincerely to Agniveer

 asli chunaav parinaam ke liye ruke to phir ve log pole vaale kaise kehlaayenge? do-paanch hajaar logon se baatcheet kar unke mat janaakar maharaashtra kaa janadesh jaahir karnaa ek prakaar se janabhaavana kaa anadar he
 But they also have a question of sinful stomach
 khaali pet par thap markar janata se thapa (ding) maarane kaa dhandha yah mandali puri eemaandaaree se karti he
 Something similar happened this time too
 unka yah dhandha unako mubarak ho
 We believe in public
 19 taarikh ko maharashtra rajya main bhagava kii vijay kii shankh dhwani hogi hi hogi
 Today, the bookies who give figures will go bankrupt and roam like beggars on the streets
 jinhen satta priy hota he unako batta jarur lagata he
 It is important to understand this interrelationship between betting and betting

 a top government official informed the news agency PTI
 pakistan ne 26 farvari se apana airspes puri tarah se band kar rakhaa he
 After the Indian Air Force's airstrikes on the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist base in Balakot, Pakistan has completely restricted its airspace for foreign flights
 kareeb 4 maheene ho gaye lekin pakistan videshi udaanon ko apane airspes ke upyog kii ijaajat nahin de rahaa
 There are a total of 11 air routes in Pakistan of which only 2 are open and both routes pass through southern Pakistan

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may be running the government with the BJP, but the fact is that his prohibition campaign did not get support from the neighboring states of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand
 lekin ab uttar pradesh main sau se adhik vyaktiyon kii jahrili sharaab se maut ke baad nitish kumaar ne puure desh main sharaab bandi lagu karne kii apil kii he
 Nitish Kumar says that if these states have to implement then it is good if this decision is taken at the level of the whole country
 nitish somvaar ko bihar vidhansabha main patrakaron se baatcheet kar rahe the
 He says that there has been a positive impact of the liquor ban in Bihar, so it would be felt late to implement it across the country
 nitish kehete hai ki desh ke kai rajyon main sharaab bandi ke samarthan main andolan chal rahaa he
 And in many states, it was also put in the manifesto, which also gave political benefits to those parties
 nitish kumaar se jab ye poocha gaya ki bihar main sharaab bandi ke baavjood sharaab kii home delivery ho rahi he to unhone mana ki is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa lekin agar sharaab bandi ke vyapak asar kaa aap vishleshan karenge to ye baat feeki pad jaati he
 Nitish also admitted that police personnel have also been found to be involved in the illegal liquor business, but whenever such reports were received, the government has taken drastic action
 unhone sharaab bandi ke baad ek lakh se adhik logon kii giraftaar ke sambandh main kaha ki jab bihar kii jelon kii kshamta hi 38,000 he tab ek lakh se adhik log jelon main kaise thunse ja sakate hai? The election of Kashi is high-profile this time too
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 2014 main bhi maidan main the or is baar bhi
 But in 2014, Arvind Kejriwal, the chief of the Aam Aadmi Party and the current Chief Minister of Delhi, is not in the fray this time
 modi ke saamne is baar congress se ajay raay hai to gathbandhan se tej bahadur hai
 However, in Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP alliance left Rae Bareli and Amethi seats for the Congress, instead the Congress made it clear by declaring not to field its candidates against Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, including Mainpuri, Kannauj, Firozabad, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar, and that Not only is the Congress in alliance, but the common fight between the SP-BSP and the Congress is with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 lekin bhartiya janata party ke sabase kaddavar ummidavaar ke saamne gathbandhan or congress ke bich hi nurakushti shuru ho gai
 Manoj Rai, spokesperson of the Samajwadi Party in Banaras, says, "if the watchman is a thief, the Congress should support the Samajwadi Party against Modi in Benaras
" ’’ ve aage jodate hai ki yah ladaai ab ‘‘asli chaukeedaar banaam nakli chaukeedaar’’ kii ho gai he
 On this, Congress candidate Ajay Rai says, "ask the socialist spokesperson why the real watchman was not remembered at first
 biguef se nikaale gaye tej bahadur ne to pehle hi vahaan par nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par parchaa bhar diya tha
 "they further add," SP, a diligent Congress worker, lures Shalini Yadav into the party first and then declares her as the candidate from Banaras
 ek hi din main uski jagah unhen ‘asli chaukeedaar’ mil jaataa he
 SP has murdered a woman's political career
 mahilaon ke liye unki party main kya jagah he, unke is kadam se spasht ho gaya
 "on the other hand, SP spokesman Manoj Rai says," We have sacrificed one of our strong candidates in the interest of the country
 haar yaa jeet kaa masalaa nahin balki hamaara makasad jaise-taise keval jeetna nahin balki sach ke liye ladanaa he
 We believe in not saying
 hamane sandesh diya he ki khaanaa maangane vaale asli chaukeedaar ko barkhaast karne vaali party kaa kaddavar netaa nakli chaukeedaari banakar kaise deshavaasiyon ko bargala rahaa he
 The martyr is asking for votes by putting a photo of the soldiers
 ’’ ve aage jodate hai, tej pratap deshbhar ke javaanon kii numaaindgi kar rahe hai
 Manoj Rai says, "congress first started discussing that it would make Priyanka Vadra Gandhi a candidate in Benaras, the activists and the public also wanted it
 lekin phir haar ke dar se unke naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kii
 "they ask, why did Priyanka Gandhi not contest the election?" Ajay Rai says, "this is the decision of the party, but the Congress never said that Priyanka is going to contest the election
" haa raibareli kii ek sabha main priyanka se jab logon ne kaha ki ve yahaan se chunaav laden to unhone poocha tha ki banaras se kyon nahin?’’ to kul milakar sap-basapa gathbandhan or congress ke bich jubaani jang chal rahi he

 The question is whether the judges appointed by the collegium system are still free from political interference! According to former judge Markandey Katju, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Court gave a big relief to the Modi government by rejecting the petition of former Gujarat IPS officer Sanjeev Bhatt due to political pressure

 The Attorney General told the Supreme Court that there are only 7 crore PAN cards, 5 crore passports and 12-15 crore ration cards in the country, while more than 92 crore Aadhaar cards have been made, but the biggest question is that the National Judicial Appointments Commission disagrees with the order The Supreme Court judge Chelameswar has raised
 unhone apane aadesh main likhaa he ki aam logon ko aisa jaj chahie jo mukademon kaa jald nipataara kare or adaalaton main bharosa paidaa kar sake

 agar amit uttar pradesh nahin aate to unki kshamta kaa pataa desh ko nahin chalata
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this at the BJP National Council meeting held at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in the capital on August 9, 18 months ago, the message was clear that as BJP President Amit Shah is now the bjp's vehicle of Modi's dream Have been made
 shah ne bhi shuruyaat dhamaakedaar kii or modi lahar se otprot kaaryakartaaon ke utsaah ko bhunaate hue party ke mahavistaar kii kai yojanaayen jameen par utaar deen
 Whether it decided to break the alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, form a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir or bring the BJP to power on its own in haryana-jharkhand, Shah truly gave wings to the party's dreams
 par ab jab bijepi adhyaksh kaa chunaav hona he to in safaltaaon ke baavjood dobaaraa adhyaksh banane kii unki raah aasaan nahin dikh rahi
 For the BJP, which has entered the modi-shah era, this is the first major post-2014 Lok Sabha election when introspection is taking place on the organizational front
 doraahe par bhagava parivarshah ke bhavishya ke bare main aupchaarik taur se 7-8 janvari ko maharashtra ke jalgaanv main hone vaali sangh ke sheersh ranneetikaron kii baithak main charchaa hogi
 The issue has intensified in the Sangh and BJP
 sutron ke mutabik, sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat, sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi, sahasarkaarywah krishna gopal or uttar bharat ke sanghachaalak bajrang laal gupta shah kii kaaryastylee se zyada khush nahin hai
 But it is said of Sah Sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale that he is currently in favor of the status quo
 bihar or dilli main puri takat jhonkne ke baavjood party ko jis tarah sharmnaak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he, sangh usase khafa he
 After the results of the Bihar election, some mps directly attributed the statement of reservation of the RSS chief Bhagwat
 usase yah sandesh gaya ki party netritv javabdehi se bachanaa chahta he, jabaki aarakshan par bhagwat kii tippanee sangh kii puraani niti ke anuroop hi thi
 When his comment was disputed, Panchjanya's editor Hitesh Shankar, who interviewed Bhagwat, told India Today, "the Sangh never talks about the weather or the election
 ” isliye sutron ke mutabik, bihar chunaav ke nateezon se thik ek din pehle 7 november ko jab dilli main sangh ke sheersh netaa aapas main baithe the to yah man banaaya tha ki bihar chunaav ke nattejey chaahe jo bhi hon, bijepi netritv main parivartan karnaa chahie
 The major reason for this was the excesses of the party, where power has been concentrated among the three leaders modi-shah-arun Jaitley (all three from Gujarat)
 lekin sangh ke duusare kheme kii daleel he ki shah ko abhi hataaya gaya to desh-duniya main majboot netaa ke taur par ubhari modi kii chhavi par sawaal uthenge
 It will also be said that the Sangh Parivar has lost faith in Modi after the Bihar election defeat, so he has tightened the screws on the organization
 iske alaava ashishnutaa kaa aarope lagaakar award waapas karne vaali brigade ko bhi modi par hamale kaa nayaa mauka mil jayega
 There is also a discussion that, avoiding the change of leadership at present, the Sangh may later send Shah to the post of Gujarat election and replace him as the Chief Minister
 sangh ke zyaadaatar netaa is daleel se ittefaq rakhane ke baavjood kendrikaran kii maujuuda sthiti main badlaav chaahate hai
 However, in the midst of these discussions, a trusted warlord of Shah says, "the bihar-delhi electoral defeat makes no sense of leadership change
" bijepi shasit rajyon main party haari hoti tab shah ke punarnirvachan par asar pad saktaa tha
 Shah is the only party president who knew that the social equation in Bihar is in favor of nitish-lalu, yet he made the party contest the election by putting the entire prestige at stake so that the morale of the workers is not weakened
 ”lekin sangh kii chintaa is baat ko lekar he ki bijepi main haaavee vyakti-puja or satta ke kendrikaran kii sthiti ko kaise badla jaae
 a senior Sangh leader says, "there is only one way to remove this kind of atmosphere in the organization and the government - reshuffle
" agar sanghathan main badlaav laana he to adhyaksh or uski team main badlaav karnaa hi hoga
 "the victories of Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir are being counted in Shah's favor
 lekin bihar or dilli main party kii haar ko bhi shah samarthak vot pratishat badaae ke rup main gina rahe hai
 In question, when Shah took charge of the BJP after the Lok Sabha elections, his style was going to change everything
 unke padaarpan se vaajapeyi-adwani yug se rajnath singh tak sahaj sulabh adhyaksh vaala yug khatm hua hi, purv nirdhaarit samay ke bina shah se milanaa naammumkin ho gaya
 He insisted on the appointment of his trustees in the team of the organization and in the beginning, by making a guiding board, elderly leaders like advani-joshi were shown the way out of the party's highest policy making body, the Parliamentary Board
 lihaaja nichle str ke kaaryakarta apni baat alaakaman tak pahunchane main hichkichane lage yaa phir un tak pahunchnaa hi mushkil ho gaya
 With the coming of Delhi Assembly elections, the resentment of the activists increased so much that in the 70-seat assembly, the BJP, which got 4 seats less than the last majority (32), could not get even 4 seats despite losing all the strength
 ab? kaaryakartaaon se milane ke liye shah ko maheene main ek din jansanvaad kaa kaarykram rakhana padaa
 Due to the dominance of the individuality in the party, the mps also began to cry
 modi sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone se 20 din pehle hi party sansadeey dal kii baithak main upi ke baliya se saansad bharat singh ukhd gaye
 Earlier no MP or leader could muster the courage to say anything in Modi's presence
 unhone mantriyon par chaar-chaar maheene tak chitthee kaa jawaab nahin dene or centre kii yojana sansadeey kshetra tak nahin pahunchane kii shikaayat rakhi to kuch vyathit saansadon ne taaliyaan bajaakar unki hausalafajai kii
 Recently, Bihar MP Kirti Azad held a press conference on the DDCA case despite Shah's refusal to put Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the dock
 bihar chunaav ke samay saansad aar
 K
 singh ne tikat bechney or daagiyon ko tikat dene kaa aarope lagaaya to saansad shatrughna sinha ne pradhanmantri se lekar bijepi netritv kii khuleam aalochana kii
 Ignoring the local leadership in Bihar elections and handing over the command to outsiders also created resentment in the local unit
 or haar ke baad to maardarshak mandal ke laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi ke saath varisht netaa shanta kumaar or yashavanth sinha ne modi-shah kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaate hue haar kii jimmedaari tay karne kii maang uthaa di
 Organizationally, Shah's decisions were also questioned
 unhone varun gandhi ko mahasachiv pad se hataaya lekin jamini aadhaar na rakhane vaale kuch netaaon ko mahasachiv bana diya
 Till Shah, there used to be weekly meetings of general secretaries in the organization, now the meeting of officials has also reduced
 haal hi main ek padaadhikari ne shah se baatcheet main is ore dhyaan bhi dilaayaa
 One officer says, "on July 2 last year, there was a meeting of the first general secretaries and office bearers in the afternoon, then Shah decided the list of new in-charge, some new departments, then asked if anyone wanted to say anything
 ” is padaadhikari ke mutabik, tay ho jane ke baad kisi main itnaa saahas na tha ki kuch bol sake
 The image of the Mahavistaraka was the image of Shah, who had been Modi's special strategist since Gujarat, as a skilled strategist
 bataur upi prabharee shah ne loksabhaa chunaav main apni ranneeti kaa hunar sabit kiya
 He even told a leader of the state during the election that not a single Muslim from the state will win the election
 yah bhavishyavaanee nahin, unki thos ranneeti kaa nateeja tha, jisamen unhone upi main ek lahar paidaa kar di thi
 But the elections in Bihar and Delhi shattered his image
 vaise vot pratishat main badhotaree ko unki uplabdhi bataaya gaya
 Although it has been argued against him in the party that Shah won the multi-cornered contest, but in states where there was a direct contest, his micromanagement collapsed
 adhyaksh banane ke baad shah ne jab bijepi ke sadasyon kii sankhya 10 karod tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa to paaramparik tareeke ko tilanjali dete hue missd kol takanic apanaai
 But claimed to have crossed the target, the figures started pointing at him
 iske baad unhone mahasampark abhiyaan kaa khaakaa buna, jisamen sabhi sadasyon tak pahunchane or unhen sadsy se kaaryakarta banane kii pahal shuru hui
 But by then the membership campaign had made many inroads
 masalan, missd kol vaale 11 karod main se kareeb 4 karod logon kaa data hi party ko nahin mil paa rahaa tha
 The party, taking advantage of being in power, sought mobile data officially from mobile companies
 companiyaan bhi mahaj 1
 Was able to give the figure of 20 crores only
 is kaam main peshewar log bhi lagaae gaye par kahin naam-pataa gadabad to kahin pin code gaayab
 The state figures were also mixed in some places
 mahasampark abhiyaan kii samay seemaa 31 july, 2015 khatm ho jane ke pakhwaade bhar baad bhi party kareeb 40 lakh sadasyon se hi sampark kar pai thi, jo 4 fisadi bhi nahin the
 Party leaders say that because of technical flaws, the number of forms submitted in the General Assembly is much higher
 lekin sutron kii maane to party is abhiyaan ko avyaavhaarik maanakar band kar chuki he
 In the haste of the organization election, Shah started a massive training campaign in the midst of the mass campaign and decided to train 1
5 million active members
 ise beete aktubar main hi puraa hona tha lekin uske do maheene baad bhi yah adhar main hi he
 P
 in charge of the great training campaign
 muralidhar raav kehete hai, “bihar chunaav main jharkhand ke log bhi lage the
 Kerala and Gujarat also had local bodies elections
 so in rajyon main prashikshan nahin ho paaya
 The organizational election process is also a reason for the delay
 baaki rajyon main mandal str tak or kuch rajyon main jila str tak ke varg ho chuke hai
 We have extended the time by three months
 ab yah march-april tak puraa hoga
 6-7 classes will also be organized at the national level
 ”sutron ke mutabik, ab is abhiyaan main 10 lakh kaaryakarta hi prashikshit kiye jaaenge
 Earlier this target was 1
5 million
 bijepi ke ek netaa ke mutabik, upar se neeche tak 10 lakh to party ke padaadhikari hi hai
 Coordinator of the training campaign Mahesh Sharma acknowledges that the expected target has not been met
 phir bhi, “itani sari chunavi gatividhiyon ke baavjood sanghathan ke kaamon ko itani variyata dena badi baat he
 The expected goals were not achieved but very good work has been done
 ”in daleelon se itar sawaal uthta he ki jab sanghathan vistaar kii yojanaayen ban rahi thim, tab aagaamee chunaav kaa andaja nahin tha? itani hadabadi kyon thi? sutron ke mutabik, shah ne jab mahasampark abhiyaan ke bich main mahaprashikshan abhiyaan shuru kiya to kuch padaadhikariyon ne isse mahasampark abhiyaan main baadha kii baat kahi thi
 But Shah rejected the pleas, calling for the organization to hold elections
 nateezaah mahavistaarak kii unki chhavi par sawaal uthne lage
 a BJP leader says, "now the challenge has increased
 pehle koi sadsy gadabadi karata tha to sakriy sadsy ke madhyam se us tak pahunchnaa aasaan tha
 Now how will the party reach the missed-call member? ”prime Minister Modi himself gave mps-mlas the goal of taking the social security scheme across the country, after completing one year of his government
 iske tahat har vidhansabha main kam se kam 11,000 logon ko yah yojana deni thi, lekin saansadon kii aruchi kii vajah se yah lakshya saakaar nahin ho paaya
 In Uttar Pradesh the party fixed it at 11,000 according to the parliamentary constituency instead of every assembly
 shah ne iske alaava namaami gange, swatchta abhiyaan, “beti bachaao, beti padhaao”, karyaalay nirmaan, karyaalay aadhunikeekaran jaisi 8 ahm pariyojnaayen shuru kin, jiske liye alag se cametiyaan bhi banaain, par zyaadaatar yojanaayen sirf baithkon tak hi simit hai
 How would it be if Shah became the BJP, despite the odds, if Amit Shah succeeded in becoming the president, which is more likely, he would have to make concerted efforts to address the concerns of the Sangh Parivar
 team gathan se lekar baaki gatividhiyon main bhi sangh kaa dakhal badhegaa
 The fact is that Shah ended the court culture in the party and focused on migration
 saadagi par jor dete hue nijee vimaan kaa prayog band karaayaa to aaleeshaan hotalon main nahin thaharne ke nirdesh die
 But on his re-election as president, his challenge will be to stop factionalism in the party and to co-ordinate with the Sangh Parivar with the seniors
 vaise, biharmen haar ke baad unhone apni chhavi badalane kii kavayad shuru kii he
 He has pushed the local leadership in Assam by changing the strategy of consolidating the entire power in the central leadership, while till now the party has been trying luck in the name of Modi
 unhone assam main sarvanand sonoval ko pradesh adhyaksh or chunaav abhiyaan samiti kii kaman saunpi he
 Even in the organizational elections, Shah allowed states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh to become the state president of choice of chief ministers
 bihar chunaav nateezon se pehle unki raay alag thi
 By the way, this change in working style is also being questioned: modi-shah got the credit for the victory so far because there was no local face in front
 aise main assam main party acha pradarshan karti he to iskaa shrey sthaneey netritv ko jayega
 If the Sangh agrees to make Shah as the biggest chairman, then it will be clear that the next Lok Sabha election will be fought under modi-shah's patronage
 modi virdohi kheme ke liye yah jhatka hoga jo ummid lagaae baitha he ki sanghathan ko sarkaar ke samanaantar khadaa kiya jaae
 
 
 
 shah na bane to?bijepi ke liye nae rashtriya adhyaksh kaa chunaav party ke bhavishya ke lihaaj se behad ahm he
 In such a situation, he is very dependent on the Sangh
 agar sangh heviveet adhyaksh banane kii ranneeti ko anjaam detaa he to kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh or kendriya sadak parivahan tathaa rajmarg mantri nitin gadakari pasand ban sakate hai
 But in such a situation, the credibility of Prime Minister Modi will be questioned because his grip on the organization will be weak
 shah ke rahete ve sanghathan main apni sabhi yojanaon ko sahajata se anjaam de paa rahe hai
 If Shah is not the chairman, the organization can once again return to the old pattern
 sanghathan or sarkaar main nae sameekaran ubharenge
 Right now the modi-jaitley-shah trio is holding on to both the BJP and the government
 rajnath singh ke saath modi ke rishton kii kadavaahat jagajaahir he to yah bhi tathy he ki gadakari ke adhyaksh rahete modi ke saath telephone par bhi baatcheet kaa sambandh nahin tha
 At the same time, former BJP minister Sanjay Joshi was given important responsibility in the party and Modi boycotted Mumbai's executive, making it a question of ego
 aakhir main joshi ko kaaryakarini se istipha dena padaa tha
 Modi's feud with Joshi is from Gujarat itself
 pichley saal joshi ke janmdin par kuch kaaryakartaaon ne badhai ke poster laga die to bhi party ne karrwai kii thi
 Joshi may return if circumstances change
 haalanki sutron ke mutabik, sangh abhi is baat par manthan kar rahaa he ki rashtriya adhyaksh ke chunaav main modi par aanch na aane paae
 Examination for the Sangh The Sangh is worried about the way power has been centralized in the BJP
 use ehsaas he ki shah ke rahete sanghathan kaa swatantra rup se chal paanaa mumkin nahin he
 Generally the Sangh has been dominating the BJP, but the way in which the worship of the person in the government and organization has increased, this situation may change in the coming times
 shah ne party main apane manamafik team banane kii sakriyata dikhaakar sanket de diya tha
 In such a situation, before the decision in the organization elections to be held before 23 January, the Sangh will have to decide its position whether it wants to retain the role of political conductor or will want to be reduced to a "moral" guide in the changed phase
 nishchit taur par bijepi adhyaksh ke chunaav main sangh hi master stroke lagaataa he
 Now he has to decide whether he will give the green signal to Shah's coronation with some conditions or Shinkja will change the organization
 
 
 manthan jari he
 Shah's strategy reported that Shah's initiative to leave his indelible mark in cardbjp by making a radical change was good in the beginning, but most of the plans started to hit the ground soon
 Prohibition of stay increased from 2,90,55,220 to 11,08,88,547 1 General membership campaign time: November 1, 2014 to April 2015
 abhiyanshpahale dinesh sharma or baad main rashtriya mahasachiv arun singh ko is abhiyaan kii jimmedaari saunpi gai
 The party adopted the technique of missed calls instead of the traditional mode of membership, with the goal of increasing its member count from 3 crore to 10 crore
 nateezaplakshya ko paar karte hue 11 karod sadsy banane kaa daawa kiya
 Thanks to these figures, the party also claimed to break the record of the party of China, claiming that it was the largest party in the world
 ise shah kii mahatvakankshi vistaaravaadi yojana ke rup main prachaarit kiya gaya
 Question: When the credibility of the missed call data was doubted, the party decided to have a mass program to reach all the members
 2 mahasampark abhiyaansamayah1 may, 2015 se 31 july, 2015 tak

 Result: The campaign stopped in the middle
 isamen badi samasya chaar karod missd kol kaa naam-pataa nahin milanaa rahaa
 Taking advantage of being in power for this, the party unofficially took the data of the mobile number from the mobile companies but they are just 1
 20 karod kaa hi aankada de pain
 Even after a fortnight of completing the campaign deadline, it reached only 40 lakh members in 11 crore
 sawalgajab sabhi sadasyon tak party kii pahunch nahin ho pai he to us par niyantran kaise rakhaa ja sakegaa? missd kol se sadsyta abhiyaan par party ke bheetar hi sawaal uthe
 In such a situation, how can BJP boast of being the number one party in the world? Now how will the party reach those members? 3 General Training Campaign Time: June 29 to October 2015 Campaign: In this campaign, National General Secretary P

 get number ek ke najadik hi up-raashtrapati kii car khadi thi
 The driver of the car loses control due to the high speed and turn and the vehicle collides directly with the Vice President's car

 For the first time terror had crossed the threshold of democracy
 puraa sansad bhawan goliyon kii chhadtadaahat se gunj uthaa thai aatankwaadiyon ke pehle hamale kaa shikaar bane ve chaar surakshakarmi jo ambesder car ko rokane kii koshish kar rahe the
 But the rest of the people in the Parliament House still did not know what happened or what is happening
 goliyon kii aawaaj kozyadaatar log pataakhon kaa shor samaj rahe the
 No one had slept in the guise that terrorists could enter inside the Parliament House
 par phir tabhi goliyon kii tadatadaahat ke bich ek dhamaake kii aawaaj aati he
 After the echo of the bullets, the first blast had announced that the temple of the world's largest democracy, the Parliament House, has been attacked
 goliyon kii tadatadaahat or dhamaakon kii gunj ke bich surakshakarmiyon ko lahuluhaan jameen par girte dekh pal bhar main tasviir saaf ho chuki thi
 And now there was panic and panic all around inside the Parliament House
 jise jidhar jo konaa dikhaai de rahaa tha wo udhar hi bhaag rahaa tha
 Even now the loudest sound of gunfire was coming from the gate number 11
 paanchon aatankwaadi ab bhi ambesder car ke hi aas-paas se goliyaan or grenade barasaa rahe the
 Then, seeing the terrorists gathered towards gate number 11, security personnel of the Parliament House along with the police and CRPF personnel move towards gate number 11
 ab donon taraf se golibari shuru ho chuki thi
 Home minister LK Advani, who was just a few hundred meters away from the firing, had also received news of the attack by then
 lihaaja laalkrishna adwani or raksha mantri jorge furnandis samet tamaam varisht mantriyon ko fouran sadan ke andar hi mahfuj jagahon par le jaaya gaya
 With this, all the doors inside the house are also closed and the security personnel take their positions there
 udhar duusari taraf suraksha karmiyon ko get number 11 kii taraf badhate dekh paanchon aatankwaadi bhi apni pojishan badalane lagate hai
 One of the five terrorists, now firing, now runs towards Gate No
 1
 jabaki baaki chaar get number 12 kii taraf badhane kii koshish karte hai
 The terrorists were somehow trying to reach the door of the house so that they could enter the house
 magar suraksha karmiyon ne pehle hi tamaam daravaajon ke ird-gird apni pojishan le rakhi thi
 Apart from this, the way the terrorists were running around in the fire, it seemed clear that they have entered but they do not know on which side the doors are for entering the house? Meanwhile, a terrorist who had moved towards Gate No
 1, proceeded through the corridor of the Parliament House to go inside the House with bullets
 lekin isse pehle ki wo apni koshish main kaamyaab hota use surakshabalon kii goli lag jaati he
 As soon as the bullet hits, he falls in the corridor close to gate number one, some distance away from the door
 pehla aatankwaadi gir chukaa tha
 But he was still alive
 surakshakarmi use puri tarah se nishane par lene ke baavjood uske kareeb jane se abhi bhi batch rahe the
 Because the fear was that he did not blow himself up
 or surakshakarmiyon kaa ye dar galat bhi nahin tha
 Because immediately after falling on the ground, when the terrorist felt that he was surrounded, he immediately pressed himself on the remote and blew himself up
 usne apane sharir par bam baandh rakhaa tha
 Four terrorists were still alive
 na sirf jinda the balki lagaataar bhaag-bhaag kar andhadhundh goliyaan barasaa rahe the
 It was as if they had come prepared to compete for hours
 kyonki unke paas goli, bam or grenade kaa puraa jakhira tha
 Which he had hidden in his body and brought in a shoulder bag
 ab tak enesji commando or sena ko bhi hamale kii khabar di ja chuki thi
 The team of Special Cell of Delhi Police, which specializes in dealing with terrorists, had also traveled to Parliament House
 par sansad bhawan main live oparation ab bhi jari tha
 The news of the attack through the news channel had now spread to India and abroad
 is bich shaayad baaki bache chaar aatankwaadiyon ko bhi apane ek saathi kii maut kii khabar lag chuki thi
 Perhaps he got this news from a blast that was carried out by a terrorist by remotely blowing himself up
 lihaaja baaki aatankwaadi ab or zyada ghabara gaye
 In panic, all the four terrorists started running here and there to find the hideout
 duusari taraf surakshakarmi ab chaaron taraf se aatankwaadiyon ko gherna shuru kar chuke the
 The firing was still on
 or phir isi dauraan get number paanch se ek or acchhee khabar ai
 Another terrorist was pelted with security personnel's bullets

 All three knew very well that they could not escape from the Parliament House alive
 lihaaza unhone bhi sadan ke andar jane kii ek aakhri koshish kii
 They started slowly moving towards Gate No
 9, firing the bullets
 magar mustaid surakshakarmiyon ne unhen get number nau ke paas hi gher liya
 About 12 a day
