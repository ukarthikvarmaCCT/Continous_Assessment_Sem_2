 Not only this, MIT is also giving scholarships to Malavika
 haalanki malvika MIT nahin balki IIT janaa chaahati thi

 isamen aamir ke apojit karina kapur najar aaengi
 The film was announced by Aamir on his birthday
 isamen apane kirdaar ke liye aamir ek baar phir vajan gata rahe hai
 According to the reports, according to the character of the film, he has to look young and for this he has to lose weight
 dengue or chikangunia ko is monsoon main dilli main rokane ke sarkari upayon ko lekar hai court puri tarah asantusht he
 Angry over the water accumulating everywhere in Delhi, the High Court has also served a notice to the Delhi Jal Board
 jal board kii supplai un jagahon par bhi ho rahi he jahaan par avaidh nirmaan kaa kaam ho rahaa he or iske chalate nirmaanadhin imaaraton main pani ke jamaa hone ke kaaran bhi machharon ke panpane kaa khatara bad rahaa he
 Meanwhile, the High Court today also told the High Court that a high level meeting is also being convened on May 13, in which a framework will be prepared on how to make arrangements for dealing with dengue and chikungunya
 hai court ne pehle hi dilli sarkaar or civik agency ko fatkaar lagaate hue kah ye tak kah diya tha ki 21veen sadi main jahaan ham har taalf aage bad rahe he, kya sarkaar or civik agency desh kii rajdhani ko dengue-chikangunia dena chaahate hai
 Actually, even after hearing the court thrice in these cases, there is no satisfactory answer from the government and all the MCD that after all what is the right preparation to stop dengue-chikungunya and malaria
 court ne kaha ki hamen aap sabhi se khanaapurti ke liye states report nahin chahie balki har vibhaag se jude bade adhikari sadak par nikalen or ye sunishchit karke hamen halafanama den ki unke ilaake main kahi koi gandagi nahin he
 In the last hearing also, the court said that if the senior officers continue to sit only in the air-conditioned rooms, then the area cannot be cleaned
 ye tabhi hoga jab khud sabhi bade adhikari safai karmchaariyon se kaam karaayenge
 The Delhi High Court said that after dengue this time, the focus should not be on the treatment but on the rescue
 agar safai samay par ho jaaegi to beemaari kaa khatra apane aap kam ho jayega
 The court once again reiterated that in no case should there be situations regarding dengue-chikungunya that have been seen during the last 2-3 years
 ek hafte pehle bhi dengue-chikangunia ko lekar hai court ne sunwaayee kii thi jisamen dilli sarkaar, emsidi, railway or contonment board ko notice jari kiya tha
 Taking cognizance of this matter, the High Court said that everyone should make sure that efforts are made to stop dengue-chikungunya and malaria in Delhi from now on
 may ke baad dilli main monsoon aa jayega or agar abhi se inbemariyon kii rokthaam kii taiyaarishuru nahin kii gai to nattejey pichley saal jaise dekhne ko mil sakate hai
 That is why the High Court already wants the Delhi government and all three mcds to complete their preparations on time
 hai court saaf kah chukaa he ki hamen bataaye ki abhi tak sabhi ne kya kya taiyaari kii he or agar nahin kii he to turant shuru kar den
 The court said that to stop Daegu and Chikungunya, preparations should not be done in the old way only
 balki logon ko beemaari se bachaane ke liye uchit shiksha, jaankaree or unke saath samvaad banane se jude kaarykram bhi kiye jaaen
 The High Court has recently taken automatic cognizance of this case after new cases of dengue-chikungunya came to the hospitals
 hai court ne do saal pehle lagaai gai ek janhit yachika kaa kuch nirdeshon ke saath nipataara kar diya gaya tha, usee piiel ko philhal swat sangyaan lete hue sunwaayee shuru kii he
 Last year, during the monsoon, thousands of people in the capital were hit by Chikungunya and a large number of people died
 2015 main bhi rajdhani main logon ko dengue kaa kahar jhelana padaa tha
 That is why the court wants that no negligence should be taken by the government and the MCD this year
 court is maamlen main agali sunwaayee 12 may ko karegaa
 Deepika's first look for Bollywood's 'express Girl' Deepika Padukone's English film Finding Fanny has been revealed
 deepika ne guuruuvaar subah 8:11 baje apane first luk ko twitor par post kiya
 Deepika's character in the film is named 'agni' and is clearly seen in her style
 deepika ne jo tasviir share kii he, usamen unhone goa main short dress pahan rakhi he
 The special thing is that he has a blood-stained knife in his left hand and his body is wet with sweat
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki deepika kaa yah andaaj film or usamen unke kirdaar ke prati utsukata jagaata he
 'finding Fanny' is being produced in English and Konkani language
 konkani bhashaa goa, maharashtra or karnataka ke saath hi kerala main boli jaati he
 The film is produced by Saif Ali Khan and Dinesh Vijan, while it is directed and written by Homi Adzania
 yah film goa main ek road trip par aadhaarit he or film kii kahani paanch kirdaaron ke ird-gird gumti he
 The discovery, mystery and thrill of love are told that all five main characters in the film go on to find Stephanie 'fanny' Fernandes, the girlfriend of an old postman
 iske liye vah ek road trip plan karte hai jo 20 minute kaa he, lekin vah rasta bhatak jate he or dedh dinon main gantavy tak pahunchate hai
 The twist in the film's story is that nobody has any idea about Stephanie
 masalan, vah jinda he yaa nahin
 He exists or he is a fantasy character
 yani film kii kahani main rahasy se lekar romaanch kaa put sabakuch he
 Apart from Deepika, the film stars Arjun Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, Dimple Kapadia, Pankaj Kapoor, Kevin demello, Anjali Patil and Ranveer Singh in the lead roles

 Rahul Gandhi said that his goal is to make the Congress accessible to all
 beete din rahul gandhi ne kerala main kaha ki uttar pradesh jaise kuch rajyon main ek hi aadmi saare ummidavaaron ke naam tay karata he
 He said, 'the most important thing for a political party is to bring out the voice of all
 raajnneetik dalon ko logon ko bataanaa chahie ki unke ummidavaar koun hai
 Rahul Gandhi while focusing on transparency said, 'many processes of political parties are hidden from the people
 yadi ye prakriyaayein chhipi hongi, to log kuch bhi bol sakate hai
 People will be suspicious if the processes are not transparent
 ’baharhaal, rahul gandhi apni 'paathshaala' main kya kuch nae tips dete hai, yah dekhne vaali baat hogi

 "it is the desire of a new generation to set new heights of success, which have made self-help books a hot cake in the last decade and a half

 The reason is the increasing youth population

 - Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) August 11, 201712: 01 AM Ghulam Nabi Azad and Raj Babbar will go to Gorakhpur Medical College today jaipur se apni ummidavaari ke elaan ke baad hui girdharilal bhargav kii mrityu ne paanch baar se chali aa rahi anwarat jeet ke unke silsile ko roak diya
 In contemporary politics, there are rare people whom the public beheads in this way
 par unke jane ke turant baad ahm sawaal uth khadaa hua ki unki jagah koun? lambey samay tak magajamaari ke baad bhaajapa ne aakhirkaar ghanashyam tiwadi par apana daanv chalaa or vasundhara raaje ne bhi unhen apana samarthan diya
 Why Tiwari? There is no doubt that they are truly political politicians
 lekin usase bhi badi yogyata unki brahman hone kii he or jaipur seat ko paramparaagat rup se brahmanon kii seat mana jaataa rahaa he
 By the way, it has to be said that Bhargava had a greater role in being a true sympathizer of the masses than his Brahmins in the huge popularity
 khayr, ek vakt rajmata gayatri devi yahaan se jitati ai thim
 The Congress has also fielded a Brahmin candidate from here as Mahesh Joshi
 siyaasi partiyon kii chunavi ranneeti ke adhyayan ke lihaaj se jaipur ek adarsh seat he
 The deciding factor is just and only caste
 sirf bhi aalaa netaa se puuchhie ki falaan ko us seat se tikat kyon diya? turant jawaab aayega ki us seat par falaan jati ke matadaata zyada hai yaa falaan jati par party kii najar he
 If the expansion of voters of a candidate's caste is also on the neighboring seat, then his chances are even stronger
 maan lijie, kisi ilaake main jat naaraaz hai
 For example, Barmer
 yahaan congress ke karnal sonaaram party se khafa hai
 In such a situation, it is believed that a section of Jats can vote for bjp's Rajput candidate Manvendra Singh
 yani sabhi jatiyon par najar maariye or phir sarvaadhik matadaata vaali jati ke pratinidhi ko tikat de dijie
 Gone are the days when Vasundhara Raje made Jhalawar her home constituency or Ashok Gehlot continued to dominate Jodhpur despite being a Mali caste
 par aaj? nagaur main jat ko hi utaarna padegaa
 And if that Jat is Jyoti Mirdha, granddaughter of Nathuram Mirdha, then it will be iced in gold
 jyoti ke rup main gahalot diggaj jat netaa kii viraasat ko ek tarah se waapas le aae hai
 However, Baba (nathuram) had risen above the purview of caste, etc
 in the fight for the benefit of the farmers
 jatigat sameekaran hi to hai jo arakshit shrenee ke ummidavaaron ko saamaanya siton par utaare jane ko majaboor kar rahe hai
 Take Meenas only
 haal ke vidhansabha chunaav ne sabit kiya he ki ve jaaton ko peeche dhakelte hue siyaasi dabadabe vaali sabase badi birdari ban gaye hai
 The Congress fielded Namonarayan Meena from the Sawai Madhopur general seat because the choice was open to Kirodilal Meena or anyone else on the Dausa reserved seat
 yahaan se ab usne purv ipies lakshmana meena ko pesh kiya he
 She wanted to tell Meenas how worried she was about her community
 sameekaran kaa hi takaza tha ki gahalot apane putr vaibhav ko savai madhopur seat se utaar na sake
 And despite having a chance, while sacrificing personal interests, Gehlot has also set an example
 jatigat samikarnon kii vajah se hi partiyaan vidhansabha chunaav main haare netaaon yaa unke parijanon ko tikat dene par majaboor ho rahi hai
 In view of the dominance of Yadavs in Alwar, BJP has given ticket to MLA Jaswant Yadav's Ardhangini Kiran from here
 congress ne bhavar jitendra singh ko utarkar dow
 Karan gave Yadav a chance to get angry
 jaipur gramin se congress ne jat lalchand kataaria ko chunaa he to bhaajapa ne rajput raav rajendra singh par daanv khelaa he
 Needless to say that after all, there is no matter of issues
 aise main agar koi acchhee chhavi or achche charitra vaale pratyaashee chunane kii baat karata he to yah vikalp ek jati vishesh ke bich hi simatakar rah jaataa he
 Many dummy candidates are also being fielded on the basis of caste to break into the vote bank of rivals
 yah vidambnaa nahin to or kya he ki tivi or sangoshtiyon vagairah main shandaar pradarshan karne vaale sachin payalat ko aadhunik jaipur kaa cheharaa banaakar pesh karne kii bajaae gurjar vot bahul ajmer se pesh kiya jaataa he
 Even Raje's son Dushyant had to send his wife Niharika, who belongs to the same community, to get the support of the Gurjars
 to mudde ye hai ki kirodilal meena agar congress se dur rahe to congress ko milane vaale meena voton par asar padegaa
 There is a belief that Meena and other tribes have drifted away from the BJP due to the agreement with the Gurjars
 ab to gurjar netaa kirodisingh bansla party main hi shaamil ho gaye hai
 The issue is also whether the BSP has a vote bank or not and if it will punish the Congress for usurping its six mlas? After delimitation, the Congress has shown greater vigilance in giving tickets to the Rajput-dominated Jodhpur seat Played the card
 bhaajapa ne apane maujuuda saansad jaswantsingh vishnoi par bharosa kiya he
 The Rajput voters may have increased, but in the changed situation, the BJP will have to try a lot here
 paali main shaamil jat belt osiyaan, bhopalgarh or bilada ke matadaata bhi haar-jeet main apni sidhi dakhal rakhenge
 This is the reason why the BJP has run the old horses
 congress ne puri tarah se jatigat samikarnon ko dhyaan main rakh phir jaaton ko mahatv dete hue badriram jakhad ko paali main utaara he to bhaajapa ke maujuuda saansad pushp jain maidan main hai
 Casteism dominates in ticket distribution
 jalaur-sirohi main kalbi maton kii bahulata ke kaaran donon partiyon ne kalbi jat ummidavaar pesh kiye hai
 Devji M
 from BJP patel or congress se sandhya choudhary hai
 Workers of both parties are unable to digest these candidates
 isi bich choudhary kii ek sidi congress ke liye galphans ban gai he
 In this, people of Chaudhary caste have been seen saying to give more importance to the party
 bhaajapa main patel kii ummidavaari kaa elaan hote hi ek pramukh daavedaar tara bhandari bhaajapa ke kendriya mukhyalay main foot-footkar rone lageen
 The Rajpurohit Rajput caste, which has been associated with the BJP so far, is also angry at not getting tickets to their representative
 jatland nagaur main parisemen ke baad laga tha ki shaayad kisi duusari jati kaa ummidavaar bhi khadaa ho sake
 But ultimately the same caste bets as Jyoti Mirdha and Bindu Chaudhary
 sansadeey chunaavon main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale jat belt medta-degana is dfa rajsamand jile main chale gaye
 In the parliamentary elections till now, merta-degana used to become MP
 in do kshetron kii jagah jaayal or ladnun nagaur main shaamil hue
 The Jayal area is also the entire Jat belt
 chaar jilon ke jod-tod se bani nai loksabhaa seat rajsamand main bhaajapa ne ajmer ke saansad rasasingh ravat ko khadaa kiya he
 They belong to this district
 congress ne nagaur ke rajput jameendaar parivaar gopalasinh idva ko yahaan se pratyaashee banaaya
 Being a second district, Edwa faced opposition from local activists
 parisemen ke baad barmer-jaisalmer sansadeey kshetra kaa bhugol kuch ke liye raahat dene vaala to kuch ke liye mushkilen badhaane vaala ban gaya he
 But straight away, most of the Rajput voters, who are BJP supporters, will be directly hurt by BJP candidate Manvendra Singh after he moves to Jodhpur Lok Sabha constituency
 nae parivesh main dhoron kii raajnneeti kaa rang chatkh ho gaya he
 Congress's Harish Chaudhary, who was contesting the election for the first time, is in the fight but the case of MLA Colonel Sonaram Chaudhary and the Muslim voters are not openly supporting the Congress
 kul 14 lakh main se do lakh musalmaan matadaata nirnaayak honge
 By the way, most of the three lakh voters are Jats here
 pichley chunaav main maanavendra ne jeet kii tikdi bana chuke karnal ko chunavi prabandhan kaushal ke boote unke hi moharon se maat di thi
 Manvendra's magic was fierce on the Muslim voters
 is dfa vaise choudhary ke paksh main jat matadaata lamaband hai
 6 out of 8 mlas of the area are Congressmen
 do to rajya sarkaar main mantri hai
 For Gehlot too, this seat is a question of prestige as he has brought Chaudhary
 bhilwara seat par maujuuda saansad ve
 P
 singh ke saamne pradesh congress adhyaksh si
 P
 joshi kii maujuudagi ne mukaable ko rochak bana diya he
 14 in total here
 92 lakh matadaataaon main sava lakh se zyada brahman hai
 Bundi's Hindoli and Nainwan region have increased the number of Gurjars to one and a half lakh
 tikdi banane kii jugat main jute singh ke tilism ko todane ke liye joshi jatigat samikarnon par hi nirbhar hai
 The newly appointed minister of state government, Ramlal Jat, can be helpful in getting him a Jat vote
 bhilwara ke gurjaron ne to karnal kirodisingh bansla ke bhaajapa main shaamil hone ko samaaj ke saath dhokhaa bataate hue unhen jile kii seemaa main na ghusane dene kii dhamkee de daali he
 Many leaders have asked him to campaign against him when he contested the election
 bhaajapa se chhitaka vot bank congress ke liye ''sone pe suhaaga'' ban saktaa he lekin prahlaad gunjal kii congress se naaraazgi ke alaava basapa se gurjar pratyaashee kii ummidavaari ke kaaran aisi ummid kam he
 BSP has contested the Science and Industrial Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Harish Gurjar here
 dakshin-purvi rajasthan ke karauli-dhaulpur, bharatpur or dausa sansadeey kshetron main sabhi rajnatik sameekaran dhwast hote dikhaai de rahe hai
 From krauli-dhaulpur reserved seat Khellalal Bairwa (congress), Dr
 manoj rajauria (bhaajapa) or hattiram jatav (basapa) pratyaashee hai
 Jatav and Khatik Samaj got tickets from karauli-dholpur seat but the Koli Samaj claimants are angry with the society for not getting tickets from any party
 todabhim panchayat samiti ke pradhan ramsingh mahavar (coli) ne congress se tikat ke liye badi koshish kii lekin safal nahin ho paae
 Bharatpur, a normal seat, has now become reserved (scheduled Caste)
 pratyaashee hai ratansingh jatav (congress) or khemchand coli (bhaajapa)
 Jatav never kept in touch with the Bharatpur Congress organization
 sarkari karmchaaree rahe jatav ritair hone ke baad congress kaa tikat le aae
 Koli is associated with the village
 raja maharaajaaon ke garh rahe bharatpur kii raajnneeti main jat samudaay kaa dabadabaa rahaa he par arakshit hone ke baad yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki jat kis ore jate hai
 This time, former IPS Laxman Meena is facing the Congress for the Dausa seat reserved for the tribe
 todabhim ke vidhayak or meena samaaj ke kaddavar netaa dow
 Kirodilal Meena filed as an independent candidate
 vidhansabha chunaav main unke saath jeene-marane kii kasame khaane vaale parasaadilal meena, ramkishor saini or mamata bhupesh main se ek bhi unke parchaa bharte vakt maujuud nahin tha
 Rajesh Pilot from this seat, followed by his wife Rama Pilot and then son Sachin Pilot have been mps
 jammu kashmir ke rajouri-poonch jile se gurjar samudaay ke qamar rabbaani ne bhi nirdaleey ke rup main parchaa daakhil kiya he
 how? They are such that the Gurjars belong to the Scheduled Tribes in Jammu and Kashmir
 dausa jile ke bare main yah dekhne ko mila he ki jahaan jis jati kaa daanv laga, vahaan usne apni manamaani or manachaahe tareeke se matdaan kiya he
 The impact of casteism is no less on Jhalawar seat
 paramparaagat rup se purv mukhyamantri or ab vipaksh kii netaa vasundhara raaje kaa garh rahe jhalawad sansadeey kshetra main pichley 6 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle raaje or pichley chunaav se putr dushyant jhalawad sansadeey kshetra ke rajput bahul matadaataaon ko rijhaate rahe hai
 After delimitation, the Congress has given ticket to Urmila Jain, wife of Congress MLA Pramod Jain 'bhaya' of Baran district, who falls in Jhalawar region after Vaishya Samaj has emerged as a big vote bank in the new equation
 is ilaake kii anta vidhansabha seat par vaisya samaaj kii acchhee aabaadi he or jhalawad main bhi samaaj kii maujuudagi thik-thaak he
 The Jhalawar region has a good penetration of Rajput voters, due to which Raje and his sons have been winning Lok Sabha elections from here, while the Congress contested Man Singh twice and Vasantha Singh in front of Vasundhara, keeping Rajput voters in mind
 Was
 is seat par gurjar bhi bahutayat main hai
 When Raje contested the 2003 assembly elections from Jhalarpatan, Rama Pilot was in front of him from the Congress
 kota seat ke pratyaashiyon ko dekhakar bhi jatigat samikarnon kaa khyaal saaf najar aata he
 The BJP has re-launched the Brahmin candidate following the old pattern
 80 ke dashak tak surakshit rahi is seat ke saamaanya hone ke baad bhaajapa ne hameshaa savarna ko hi tikat diya
 Due to poor health of sitting MP Raghuvir Singh Kaushal, this time BJP has bet on Shyam Sharma
 rajya ke uttar pashchim chor par sthit ganganagar loksabhaa seat kaa bhugol bhi badal gaya he
 After the delimitation the two assembly constituencies Tibbi and Kesari Singhpur came to an end
 nauhar or bhaadaraa churu main chale gaye
 Raisinghnagar, Suratgarh and Pilibanga were removed from Bikaner and added
 lekin ek baat nahin badali
 That is yahaan se nau baar congress or teen baar bhaajapa jiti he
 But even once, no non-meghwal MP has been formed
 pannaraam baroopal se hui is shuruyaat ko birbalaram, begaaraam, shankar pannu ne aage badhaayaa
 Now the continuation of Begaram's son Nihalchand continues
 unke saamne congress kii ore se bhartraam meghavaal hai
 Dr
 from BJP o
 P
 mahendra or seetaram maury daavedaaron main the
 But the party could not think ahead of Nihalchand
 asal main, anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit ganganagar se is varg kaa ummidavaar utaarna rajnatik dalon kii majaburi he
 But why only Meghwal? Trying to answer this, Congress leader Jagdish Jandu says, "meghwalas have about a third of the SC vote bank here, so political parties feel that this caste will prove to be decisive
 yah feedback hi shaayad har chunaav main ummidavaaron ke chayan kaa aadhaar banane laga he
 "whatever the political equations, no matter the issues, no one wins, the Ganganagar Lok Sabha seat is going to elect Meghwal as its MP for the 16th consecutive time
" ek hi mudda he or wo he meghavaal kaa
 Who was saying that talking about caste in elections is not a democratic ideal
 to bhaiya, pichhali vasundhara raaje sarkaar bhrasht thi yaa nahin yaa phir manmohan singh kamjor pradhanmantri hai yaa nahin? raaje zyada urjavan thim yaa gahalot hai? centre main bhaajapa behatar sabit hogi yaa congress? ye sab baaten partiyon ke patibaddh votbank ke hi 
 She comes in mind
 partiyon kaa maananaa he ki baaki duusare log to jati kii line par vot daalate hai
 And this perception of the parties has generally proved to be true
 rajasthan kii raajnneeti kuch zyada hi jativaadee ho gai he

 Team India's poor performance in the second Test match played against England at Lord's took them away
 barish se prabhavit is test match main team india chauthe din hi pari or 159 ranon se yah match ganvaa baithi
 In the overcast conditions, the Indian batsmen had no answer in front of the English bowlers who were on fire
 pehali pari main 107 ranon par hi dher hone ke baad duusari pari main bhi viraat ke dhurandharon ne sarender kar diya or sirf 130 ranon par dharaashai ho gaye
 Some of the mistakes of captain Virat Kohli in the Lord's Test match are heavy on Team India
 team chayan se lekar captaini ke morche tak viraat jujhate hue najar aae
 Let's take a look at Team India's mistakes: 1
 out of form rahul ko dhawan kii jagah mauka:viraat kohli ne lords test match main shikhar dhawan kii jagah out of form lokesh rahul ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Talking about Rahul's performance, after scoring 101 runs in the first match of the T20 series on the current England tour, Rahul scored 6 and 19 runs in the next two T20 matches
 iske baad vanade siries ke pehle do muqablon main rahul ne 9 or 0 ran banaae, jiske baad tisare vanade se unhen drop kar diya gaya
 Kohli dropped Pujara in the first Test to feed Rahul, in which the batsman scored 4 and 13 runs
 nateeja team india yah match 31 ranon se ganvaa baithi
 The extent was reached when captain Kohli dropped Dhawan to feed this out of form batsman in the Lord's Test
 rahul ne lords test match main 8 or 10 ran banaae
 2
 puchhlle ballebaajon kaa koi tod na hona:birmingham test main sam kuren team india ke liye saradard sabit hua jab unhone duusari pari main england kaa score saat wicket par 87 ran se 180 tak pahunchaa diya
 In the Lord's Test, Chris Woakes batted at number seven and scored his first century of his career, scoring an unbeaten 137 runs to dismiss Team India from the match
 vokes jab ballebaaji ke liye aae to us samay england kaa score 5 wicket par 131 ran tha
 He shared an 189-run partnership with Johnny Bairstow for the sixth wicket
 3
 Kuldeep Yadav's selection in place of Umesh Yadav: Rain was forecast on all five days of the Lord's Test match and it was expected to rain intermittently during the match
 lekin iske baavjood overcast condishans main bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne tej gendbaaj umesh yadav kii jagah chinamen kuldeep yadav ko mauka diya
 The Indian team went into the match with Kuldeep Yadav as the extra spin bowler while the situation was according to the fast bowlers and it seemed that the third fast bowler would have helped the team
 barish ke kaaran bhartiya team management kaa yah daanv ulataa pad gaya
 4
 pehali pari main pujaara kaa ran out hona:lords kii jis pich par bhartiya ballebaajon kaa tikna mushkil tha us par pujaara jaise ballebaaj kaa khadaa hona jaruri tha lekin pehali pari main captain viraat kohli kii galat kol kii vajah se unhen ran out hokar apana wicket ganvaana padaa, nahin to bharat kii pehali pari kii tasviir kuch or hi hoti
 Pujara faced 87 balls in the second innings
 haalanki us dauraan unhone 17 ran hi banaae, lekin halaat us samay ran banane se zyada jaruri wicket par tikna tha
 Pujara, who played a very important role for the Indian team at number three, scored 49 in 99 innings of 59 matches so far in Test cricket
 45 kii ausat se 4549 ran banaae or unka ucchtam score 206 ran rahaa he
 5
 wicketcaping or ballebaaji main flop karthik ko pant par tarjeeh:riddhimaan saaha kii jagah bhartiya team main shaamil kiye gaye wicketcaping ballebaaj dinesh karthik na wicketcaping thik se kar paa rahe hai or na hi batting
 From Birmingham to Lord's, nothing changed
 Karthik was seen battling behind the wicket
 iske alaava ballebaaji main karthik ne birmingham test main 0 or 20 ran banaae
 Karthik scored 1 and 0 in the Lord's Test match

 udyog sangh associated chambers of commers and industry of india (asocham) ne ek adhyayan main yah anumaan jaahir kiya he
 In the financial year 2013-14, foreign investment of about 29 billion dollars came into the country

 yah haar ke jabadon se khinchakar nikaali gai fatah thi
 Many of the Congressmen had prepared themselves for the latest loss of morale - losing Ahmed Patel's Rajya Sabha seat
 magar aadhi raat ko jab8agast kii taarikh9agast main badali or bijepi tathaa congress donon ke bade netaa apane phonon par jute the or nakhun chaba rahe the,chunaav ayog taaranhar ke taur par aayaa or usne congress ko vaaki is afat se baahar nikaal diya
 The Election Commission rejected two votes of Congress rebels as invalid, leaving Patel needing 44 votes instead of 45 to win a fifth term in the Upper House
 unhen thik44vot hi mili,jisaki unhen jarurat thi
 Oddly enough, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said, "thankfully there is an Election Commission
" "pichley saal june main party duusari taraf thi,jab haryana ke rajyasabha chunaavon main vah apane12voton ko avaidh ghoshit kar dene ke liye chunaav ayog ko bura-bhala kah rahi thi
 Patel is Sonia Gandhi's political secretary and staunch loyalist
 agar patel ke taqatvar dost hai,to unhone taqatvar dushman bhi banaae hai jo unhen maaf karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Chief among them is BJP President Amit Shah
 shah ko2010main teen maheene jail main bitaane pade the or isaki vajah thi paanch saal pehle police hiraasat main hui soharabuddin shaikh kii kathith hatya se jude aarope jo unke upar lagaae gaye the
 Shortly, but it damaged Shah's political career and he blamed Patel for this
 8agast ko rajyasabha ke apane pehle kaarykaal ke liye gujarat se chune gaye shah ne patel ko rajyasabha kii seat se bedakhal karne,unke siyaasi khatme main teji laane or''congressmukt bharat"ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko aage badhaane ko apana mishan bana liya
 Shah's overwhelming desire for revenge and his intense desire to insult Patel turned a dull and dull political event into a grim battle
 yahi vajah thi ki party kii ashobhaneey antarkalah sahit ek mushkil or thakaaoo muhim par chintan-manan karne ke bajaae congress is tarah jashn manaa rahi he maano usne dobaaraa janm liya he
 Experts say that Patel was also so moved by the results as never before
 apni seat bachaana unke liye pratishtha kaa mudda ban gaya tha
 Patel knew that the defeat would also lift the spirits of those within the Congress who want to see his hold in the party weakened
 jab rajyasabha ke sadsy or congress netaa jairam ramesh ne kaha ki congressi apni sultanate jane ke baad bhi sultaanon ko tarah bartaav kar rahe hai,tab kuch logon ne patel par kataaksh ke taur par isaki vyakhya kii
 Ramesh is close confidant of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and his absence was clearly visible in Patel's campaign
 rahul ne bhi un netaaon ke prati khaas utsaah nahin dikhaaya jinhen patel kii saraparasti hasil thi
 Among them was Himanta Biswa Sarma, who switched sides to BJP last year
 congress ke ek yuva saansad bataate hai,''rahul or patel kii siyasat ke tareeke alag hai
 "while requesting to print his point without naming it, he also said that there is no personal feud between the two, there is a difference of ways
" "iskaa matlab he ki congress banty hui he or aksar dhulmul haalat main rahati he
 He does not understand what he will do after the electoral debacle and many staunch supporters leave
 misaal ke liye,sarama ke party chhodkar chale jane kaa nateeja use pichley saal assam vidhansabha main haar se chukaana padaa
 Any possibility of success in the Gujarat elections to be held in December is blurred with veteran leader Shankar Singh Vaghela who left the party in July
 ye sari gadbaditaan ek gairmaujuud party alaakaman kii adhyakshata main ho rahi hai
 "there is no consensus between Rahul and Sonia on how to handle disgruntled leaders," says a Congress general secretary

 dekhie is gane kaa trailor- In Bollywood, 'bahubali' proved to be a film that overnight made South's superstar Prabhas a superstar of India
 ab khabaren aisi hai ki unhen tamaam bade-bade banners se ophers aa rahe hai
 The name of Yash Raj Films is also included in this list
 afvaah he ki yashraj films ke adhikariyon ne prabhas ko 'dhooma 4' ke liye aprope kiya he
 Prabhas himself now considers himself ready to play a great innings in Bollywood
 sutron ki maane toprabhas 'bahubali'kii special screening ke dauraan hi aditya chopra kii najar main aae
 Along with Aditya, director Vijay Krishna Acharya was so impressed with Prabhas' performance that he decided to sign him for 'dhoom 4'
 abhi tak is khabar se judi koi aadhikarik pushti nahin kii gai he
 Dhoom has always been a series in which Villain has been given the most footage
 iske liye aditya khud bhi ek aise actor ko sin karnaa chaahate hai jo lambaa-chaudaa or baari-bharkam hone ke saath saath charming bhi ho
 In such a situation, Prabhas is an excellent option
 lekin prabhas philhal apana puraa dhyaan'bahubali 2' kii shootingmein laga rahe hai
 Earlier, there were also reports that Dhoom 2's superstar Hrithik Roshan is in talks for the lead role in 'dhum 4', but now it is heard that Hrithik will be in the guest appearance in it
 vahiin prabhas is baar lead villen kaa kirdaar nibhaa sakate hai
 If sources are to be believed, actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh have also been discussed for Villain in 'dhoom 4' before Prabhas

 But even then you should stand for it
 ' The actress also said, 'it is very wrong to be diplomatic and not support any party
 kyonki antat: aap vaastaviktaa main galat chijen kar rahe insaan ko protsaahit karte hai
 Therefore, i feel that not taking any stand is also not right in the present times

 Newly appointed Tourism Minister of Punjab Navjot Singh Sidhu is preparing a new policy to promote tourism in Punjab
 jiske mutabik jis tarah se gujarat tourism ke brands ambesder amitabh bachchan hai usee tarah se amitabh bachchan yaa phir unke jaisi hi kisi badi persenality ko punjab tourism kaa brands ambesder niyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu has also started work on this new campaign of the ministry of his tourism department
 sutron ke mutabik siddhu jald hi amitabh bachchan yaa kisi or badi tivi persenality ko punjab tourism kaa brands ambesder niyukt karwaane ke liye policy banaakar CM captain amarinder singh ko saunpane vaale hai
 The name of Amitabh Bachchan as well as superstar Akshay Kumar is also included in the race to become the brand ambassador of Punjab Tourism
 haalanki apane mantralay kii is nai tourism policy ko lekar navjot singh siddhu khulkar kuch to nahin kah rahe hai lekin unhone saaf kar diya ki ye policy taiyaar kii ja rahi he or jald hi isko lekar siem captain amarinder singh se bhi parmishan le lee jaaegi
 Captain Amarinder Singh took a jibe about Navjot Singh Sidhu's new policy on Punjab tourism, and why should i not be made the brand ambassador of Punjab Tourism with Amitabh Bachchan
 pehle vaadon kii ore dhyaan den: bikram singh majithia, senior leader, akali dalvahi punjab tourism ke liye brands ambesder dhund rahe navjot singh siddhu ko akali dal ne naseehat di he ki wo khud bhi ek badi TV persenality hai to kyun nahin wo hi punjab tourism ke brands ambesder ban jate
 The Akali Dal hoped that Navjot Singh Sidhu would be the brand ambassador of his tourism ministry if he would not take any money from the government
 akali dal ke senior leader or purv mantri bikram singh majithia ne kaha ki ek or to congress kii navaniyukt sarkaar ye kah rahi he ki unke paas sarkaar chalaane ke liye paisa nahin he or punjab kii aarthik sthiti thik nahin he or duusari ore brands ambesder niyukt karne ke naam par karodon rupye dene kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 Majithia said that first the Captain Government should pay attention to the promises made to the people and the farmers have gained power by making big promises of loan waiver, the government should pay attention to fulfill those promises
 aam aadmi party ne bhi congress sarkaar kenvajot singh siddhuke punjab tourism ke liye brands ambesder niyukt kiye jane ke faisle par sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki ek ore to congress sarkaar punjab kii khasta mali haalat ko lekar safedaptr laane kii baat kar rahi he or vahiin duusari ore brands ambesder ke naam par is tarah se karodon kharch karne kii baaten kii ja rahi hai
 Actually Navjot Singh Sidhu wants to improve the governmental functioning of his ministries and in this exercise he wants to appoint a brand ambassador for Punjab Tourism, but the opposition has spent crores on the name of the brand ambassador of the Congress government, which is lamenting the dismal state of Punjab

 But in the meantime, a poster of the state Congress president Kamal Nath has made the Congress party gritty
 darasal,bhopalmein congress karyaalay ke baahar ek poster laga hua he jisame logon ko kamalnath ke bare main jaankaree di gai he
 It is written on "who is Kamal Nath?" Seeing the way Kamal Nath has been told in the poster, it seems that people do not know Kamal Nath at all
 poster main likhaa he ki ''kamalnath lagaataar 9 baar se chhindwara se saansad hai
 "also written," Kamal Nath has 40 years of political experience "and has been a minister at the Center 5 times
 poster main aage kamalnath kii ore se karaae gaye vikaas kaaryon kaa bhi zikr he, jaise unhone 'chhindwara main 4060 kilometre sadakon kaa jaal bichaaya', 'puure vishwa me sabase zyada rojgaar prashikshan centre chhindwara main banawaaye'', '2012 main asia bijnes award se sammanit' jaisi baton ko bataaya gaya he
 Finally, Kamal Nath has been written as the only leader from India who has been awarded at the World Economic Forum 12 times and Kamal Nath has won consecutive elections from 1980 to 2014
 poster ko dekhakar aisa lag rahaa he maano pradesh main kamalnath ko koi nahin jaanata
 At the same time, the BJP, which had been accusing Kamal Nath of being an outsider since he was made the state Congress president, got another chance to attack the sitting Congress
 bijepine congress par tanj karte hue kaha ki khud congress ke log hi jab kamalnath ko bahari samaj rahe hai to bhala pradesh kii janata kamalnath ke netritv ko kaise sweekaar karegi?congress ne di safyeeposter par jab congress ke netaaon se baat kii gai to unhone bataaya ki is poster ke zarie bijepi ke tathakthith vikaas kaa jawaab diya gaya he
 According to the Congress, in the "development of Budhni and development of Chhindwara", Chhindwara will remain heavy and hence Kamal Nath has been elected by the people of Chhindwara nine times in a row, but the poster talks about the false facts about development

 Star appealed Samrat is the one who has done films like 'bittu Boss' and 'fukrey'
 vah film main kaaphi mehnat karte najar aate hai, or yah mehnat unke sicks packs main kaaphi najar bhi aa jaati he
 His acting is right
 yami gautam maasoom pahari ladki banane kii koshish karti najar aati hai, lekin vah is kirdaar main vah taab paidaa nahin kar saki hai jo romantic filmon main honi chahie
 Pulkit and Yami's chemistry is also cold
 urvashifilm main hotnes kaa chhaunk lagane aati hai
 He is also right in acting
 rishi kapur ne bhi acha hi kaam kiya he
 The film is said to be a low budget
 sangeet kaaphi acha he
 There are beautiful views
 lekin script utani jabardast nahin ho saki
 The film is being released on Valentine's Week and is also being released on a large scale
 lekin film main aaj kaa ishk najar nahin aata he or film ko box offis par isi pareshaani se jujhna hoga
 One phrase is to go one step forward and two steps back

 We are not just going backward two steps by taking one step forward, but are running backwards
 central board of film certification (sibiefasi) is muhaavarey par kaaphi teji se amal karne main laga he
 Its new act prohibits the release of the Hollywood superhit film Fifty Shades of Gray

 Whose book has been read the most by women all over the world
 film ek ladki or ladke kii kahani he
 The film is made aesthetically and is not at all like a porn movie
 lekin hamen kya? ham to tehre shuchita vaale
 So the board has put itself in the queue of Malaysia, Kenya, Indonesia and several Gulf countries by stopping the release of this film
 sam tailor-johnson kii is film main kai sex seens chhaant die gaye the or ise bhartiya hisaab se edit kar diya gaya tha
 But otherwise
 yahaan nahin relies hogi 'fifty shades of grey'is tarah aisa lagata he ki hamaara board hamen is film ke laayak nahin maanata
 He does not trust our understanding
 use lagata he ki is tarah ke vishay ko pachaa paane kaa madda hindustaniyon main nahin he
 The incidents of forced love, sex and rape have been common in Indians whose films have been in force since the beginning
 jahaan kabhi yah jaanane kii koshish nahin kii gai ki balaatkaar hone par diya bujhane or heroin ke ranjit ke haathon shikaar hone ke baad kamare se baahar thake-haare nikalne kaa bachche kya matlab nikaalte rahe hai
 There is a front against such a film which has no such thing as forcible
 vah bhi aise daur main jab is desh kaa ek bada hissaa yuvaaon kaa he
 Keep in mind that in 2012, when the censor board asked to cut some offensive sex scenes of the film The Girl with Dragon Tattoo, the director of the film stopped its release in India
 vaaki is tarah ke vaakyon kaa saamne aana hamaare aadhunik hote samaaj ke syah rangon main se sirf ek or rang ko hi pesh karata he
 What is the book Fifty Shades of Grays in England el
 James wrote and it made headlines overnight
 beshak is kitaab main sex ke kisi bhi rup ko dikhaaya gaya ho lekin isaki lekhika ne isaki kamyaabi kaa raaj bataate hue kaha tha, 'auraton ko ek acchhee prem kahani pasand aati he or fifty shades of grey dil se isi tarah hi kii prem kahani he
 'of course in the film, there has been an attempt to make this thing very well
 aaie jaanate kahani he kya
 
 
 An easy-going girl is Anastasia
 sharmai or ghabaraai-si
 She meets Ittecan, a business tycoon Christian Gray
 vah use acha lagata he lekin kahaan arsh or kahaan farsh sochakar ana aage bad jaati he
 But Christian's heart falls on that girl
 ana ko ehsaas hota he ki chrishchiyan ke jivan main prem kii jagah nahin he
 The two get closer
 ana ko chrishchiyan acha lagata he
 She starts liking him
 donon kadam aage badhaate hai
 Christian has sex with Ana
 sex bilkul kisi aam premi yugal jaisaa
 But the Christian world is very different, in which leather hunters, ropes, grips and feelings of tormenting their partner during sex are rife
 chrishchiyan ana ko sab sach-sach bataata he
 Also shows its redroom which is full of such sex toys
 phir ek contract banataa he jo ana ko chrishchiyan kii is duniya main kadam rakhane se pehle sin karnaa hota he
 Ana collects information related to BDSM (bondage and Discipline Sadism and Masochism i
e
 Bondage and Discipline, Pain and Fun)
 phir contract kii kuch sharten vah manjuur karti he or chrishchiyan kii dard se charam sukh hasil karne kii duniya main ghus jaati he
 The first encounter is of spanking (licking Ana's buttocks)
 uske baad redroom main ugr sex hota he
 Then one day Ana asks Christian to punish her because she wants to see the extent of this contract
 chrishchiyan belt ke saath ana ke nitambon par waar karata he or uske baad donon ke bich dooriyaan bad jaati he
 
 
 However, it is a trilogy and two more films are yet to come
 kamasutra main bhi he spanking kaa zikraaisa nahin he ki bharat main sirf maasoom tip ke sex kaa hi varnan he or ham bhartiya to sirf bachche paidaa karne ke liye hi sex karte aae hai
 In the Kamasutra of Vatsyayan, there is a hint that we had learned to cross boundaries in sex hundreds of years ago
 kamasutra kahata haih sex jhagade kaa hi ek rup he kyonki vaasana kii jad main tark nihit he or iskaa charitra duragrahi kism kaa he
 It is mentioned at which places during sex and how light and strong spankings are to be established
 kandhe, sir, stanon ke bich or pichley hisson par chaante jamaaye ja sakate hai
 It can be inverted with hands, with open arms, palm and flat part of palm
 yahi nahin, daant kaatane or chutki kaatane kaa bhi zikr he lekin iske liye saamne vaale paksh kii manjuuri hona bhi jaruri he kyonki kuch hi auraten is tarah ke vyavhaar main anand paati he
 Kamasutra is one of the first books to speak candidly on topics such as pleasure in pain and safety during sex

 us samay party ke kai varisht netaaon ne is baat ko mana tha ki aap par bijepi ko mili maamuli badhat—28 ke mukaable 32 siten—mukhya rup se vardhan ko sambhavit mukhyamantri ke rup main pesh karne kii vajah se thi
 The then BJP President Rajnath Singh had also faced criticism from the party people for initially showing hesitation in the name of Vardhan, as most people believed that the BJP could not get majority in Delhi due to this delay
 ek bijepi netaa ne kaha, “kai guton se labarej party main vardhan kii kisi se na takaraane vaali chhavi hi unhen hameshaa sabakaa chaheta banaati rahi
 “but in 2015, he is nowhere to be seen on the campaign front
 pichley saal unhen ekaayak vidhansabha se hataakar loksabhaa chunaavon main khadaa kar diya gaya
 Sources say that that too was the result of an attempt to stop Vijay Goyal from contesting elections from Chandni Chowk
 iskaa yah bhi matlab tha ki purv dilli pradesh bijepi adhyaksh or maujuuda rajyasabha sadsy vijay goyal kii bajaae harshavardhan ke hi kendriya mantri banane kii bhi sambhaavna thi
 If Harsh Vardhan had been the Health Minister, who had got the first portfolio, it would have gained a lot of image from him before the Delhi elections
 lekin kuch hi maheene baad unka ‘demoshan’ karke unhen yah maujuuda vibhaag thama diya gaya
 a senior BJP leader engaged in managing the party's election campaign in Delhi dismissed the claims that Vardhan was given a 'light' department so that he could spend more time in Delhi
 unhone kaha, “pradhanmantri apane mantriyon par kareebi nigaah rakhte hai
 Vardhan's notional demotion is in fact a result of his lower than expected performance in the eyes of the government
 ” haalanki hitaishi vardhan ko nazarandaaj karne ke liye mukhyamantri pad kii khatir loksabhaa sadasyon ko na chunane kii modi kii niti kaa hawala dete hai

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar surrounded the Mamata Banerjee government in this matter

 He said that the state government has been asked to report immediately on the incident
 vahiin rajya main sattarudh trinmul congress ne palatwaar karte hue dhankhad par chuninda tareeke se bolne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki vah jis tarah se baat kah rahe hai, kisi rajyapal ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 Earlier, after the triple murder, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said, "the incident is an embarrassment to humanity

 supreme court ne rajeev gandhi hatyakand main maut kii sajaa se raahat paane vaale teen doshiyon ko reeha karne ke tamilnadu sarkaar ke faisle par aaj roak laga di
 The court said that there are some procedural flaws in this decision of the state government
 faisle par kapil sibbal ne kaha ki unki yachika teen logon (santhan, murugan or perarivalan) ke khilaaf thi
 The other killers (nalini Sriharan, Robert Pius, Ravichandran and Jayakumar) will also petition
 pradhan nyaayadhish pi sadashivam kii adhyakshata vaali teen sadasyeey khandpeeth ne in teen kaidiyon ke maamle main yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa rajya sarkaar ko nirdesh diya
 The death sentence of these three prisoners was commuted to life imprisonment by the apex court
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki chaar anya doshiyon kii sajaa maafee ke maamle main kendra nai yachika daayar kar saktaa he
 The court said during the hearing on the plea of the Central Government that the state government has not followed all the procedural points as laid down in the law
 isliye kendra kii arji main uthaaye gaye sawaalon par vichaar kiya jayega
 The court said that it is not taking away the right of the state government to waive the sentence of the prisoners, but the states have to follow the procedure
 court ne iske saath hi tamilnadu sarkaar or in doshiyon ko notice jari kiye
 All of them have to respond to the notice within two weeks
 is maamle main court ab 6 march ko aage vichaar karegaa
 Earlier, the Tamil Nadu government vehemently opposed the central government's application
 rajya sarkaar ne kaidiyon kii rihaai par roak lagane kaa aadesh nahin dene kaa anurodh kiya
 To this, the judges said, "we are not underestimating the authority of the state government, but we are looking at the procedure adopted by it
" court ne kaha ki maut kii sajaa ko umr kaid main tabdeel karne kaa parinaam swat: hi sajaa main maafee nahin ho saktaa he or jail se kaidiyon kii rihaai se pehle kanoon main pratipaadit uchit prakriya kaa paalan karnaa hi hoga
 Earlier this morning, the central government filed an application in the court to stay the decision of the Tamil Nadu government to release the culprits in this case
 nyaayalay is par sunwaayee ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 On behalf of the Central Government, Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran requested the state government to stay the decision
 unka kahana tha ki teen doshiyon kii maut kii sajaa ko umr kaid main tabdeel karne ke sheersh adaalat ke nirnay par punarvichaar kii yachika par faisla hone tak rajya sarkaar ko in kaidiyon ko reeha karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaani chahie
 The apex court had commuted the death sentences of Santan, Murugan (both are Sri Lankan Tamils) and Perarivalan to life imprisonment in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case on the basis of 11 years of delay in handling mercy petitions
 court ke is nirnay ke baad rajya sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko hi is maamle ke sabhi saat doshiyon ko reeha karne kaa faisla kar liya tha
 Santan, Murugan and Perarivalan are currently lodged in Vellore Jail
 rajya sarkaar ne inke saath hi 21 may, 1991 ko rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke maamle main umr kaid kii sajaa bhugat rahe chaar anya doshiyon nalini, rabart paayas, jayakumar tathaa ravichandran ko bhi rajya sarkaar ne reeha karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The state government had set a time limit of three days for himself and the central government in the matter of his release
 tada adaalat ne janvari, 1998 main rajeev gandha hatyakand ke abhiyukton ko doshi tehraate huye unhen maut kii sajaa di thi
 The apex court confirmed it on 11 May 1999

 The administration is claiming that the families of the riot victims have been compensated and are leaving the camp on their own free will, but when the NDTV team visited the village of Loi, it was found that the victims' families said they were forced to leave the camp has been done

 romance ko lekar mahilaon or purushon kii soch alag-alag he
 Where women think about men, they definitely think about the vital figure of a girl when she sees a girl
 wo purush mahilaon ko romance ke maamle main thodaa kaccha maanate hai
 Women believe that sex goes on 24 hours in the minds of men, while men believe that women do not think about sex if it is not necessary
 yah khulaasa haal hi main hue ek survey ke nattejey main kiya gaya he
 However, during the survey, men did not deny that they think about sex most of the time
 lekin aisa bhi nahin he ki vah unke aachaar vyavhaar par haaavee ho jaae
 Men want women to know certain things about romance and sex
 jaise ki mahilaon kii tarah hi purushon ko apni tarif sunanaa pasand he
 Especially if the girl praises him during romance, he likes it
 kuch or bhi baaten
 
 
 1
 sambandh banane ke baad purush kuch der ke liye chup rahanaa chaahate hai
 Some want solitude
 iske vipareet mahilaayein acchhee-acchhee baaten or gale laganaa chaahati hai
 2
 purush chaahate hai ki mahilaon ko ye baat maaloom honi chahie ki sex shaareerik jarurat he, na ki rivaaj, jisamen forple yaa bhaavnaatmak boj ladanaa jaruri ho
 Fat people do not take interest in romance, they will be surprised to know the reason
 
 
 3
 Many times in those moments women also pretend to fake organ
 purush ye nahin chaahate
 Men want women to show what they feel while making a relationship
 4
 Women love to do makeup and dress themselves before romance

 yahaan dekhen video: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday spoke openly on several issues, including GST, the program of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)
 is dauraan vah desh ke chartered acountents ko bahalaate, samajhaate, chetate or phir rasta dikhaate najar aae
 Earlier on reaching the program, PM Modi launched the new syllabus of CA and congratulated ICAI on its foundation day
 is dauraan logon ne modi-modi ke naare lagaae, jis par piem modi ne unka shukriya adaa kiya
 PM Modi said that GST is the beginning of a new path in India's economy
 chartered acountents ko desh kii sansad ne pavitra adhikaar diya he
 GST is essential for economic health
 sie arthjagat ke bade stambh he, jin par desh kii aarthik jimmedaari hoti he
 He said that four Purusharthas are mentioned in the scriptures, which include Artha, Dharma, Kama and Moksha
 unhone kaha ki chartered acountend arthjagat ke rishi-muni hai, jo is arth ke kshetra main logon ko maarg dikhaate hai
 Modi told the CA present in the program that there is no difference between me and your patriotism
 janata desh ko sankat se ubaar detii he, lekin agar us desh main kuch logon ko chori karne kii aadat pad jaae, to vah desh kabhi nahin uth paata
 All dreams break and development stops
 unhone kaha ki aise logon ke khilaaf sarkaar ne kai kanoon banaae hai or puraane kanoonon ko sakht kiya gaya he
 He said that deposits made by Indians have reached the lowest level in the records so far
 endie sarkaar ke aane ke baad swiss bainkon main jamaa bharatiyon ke kaledhan main 45 fisadi kii kami ai he, jabaki saal 2013 main videshon main jamaa kaledhan main 42 fisadi ijapha hua tha
 This is the result of action against black money
 modi ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad sie ko bahut kaam karnaa padaa
 Even many cas had to cancel their holidays
 unhone kaha ki philhal teen lakh se zyada companiyaan shaq ke ghere main hai
 Apart from this, one lakh fake companies have been locked in a pen
 aisi registerd companiyon ko ek jatke main khatm kar diya gaya
 Only such patriotism can take such a big decision
 shell companiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja rahi he or aane vaale dinon main inke khilaaf or kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 So far, 37 thousand shell companies have been identified
 unhone kaha ki avaidh lenden karne vaale logon kii pahchaan kerani hogi
 There are more than 20 million engineers and managers in the country
 saal main do karod se zyada log videshi daure par gaye
 Every year a number of crores of vehicles are bought, but only 32 lakh people tell their earnings more than 10 lakh rupees, which is not a reality
 unhone kaha ki pichley 11 saal main sirf 25 sie ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 He questioned whether only 25 cas made a mess during this time
 desh ke log chori karne lage, to vikaas ruk jaataa he
 One has to add his responsibility to the treasury of the country
 gaiyr kanoonee kaam main shell companiyon kii kisi na kisi sie ne madad kii hogi
 He said that demonetisation was a big step against corruption
 aazaadee kaa netritv vakeelon ne kiya tha or janata ke adhikaron ke liye apni jaan kii baaji laga di thi
 He appealed to the CA to advise his clients to pay taxes honestly

 Audis of the country can only do CA
 sie ke hastakshar par sarkaar bharosa karti he or companiyon ko registerd kar diya jaataa he
 In such a situation the CA should not let the trust of the countrymen break
 is dauraan modi ne kaha ki sie kaa matlab ab chartered and acurasi or chartered and othentisi hona chahie
 He said that gas connections are given to poor women with tax money, pension to the elderly and salary to the soldiers who protect the country on the outskirts
 modi ne desh ke sie kaa ahvan kiya ki vah bharat ke sapanom ko puraa karne main yogadan den
 He also appealed that by 2022, when we are celebrating 75 years of independence, the CA here cannot illuminate the name of the country by joining four of the world's largest accounting firms
 darasal, big for duniya ke sheersh aise santhaan hai, jo badi-badi vaishvik companiyon ko sevaayen detii hai
 He said that we are not involved even today
 hamame yogyata bhi he or ham isamen shaamil bhi ho sakate hai
 Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley addressed the program and explained the benefits of GST
 jetali ne kaha ki GST lagu hona desh ke liye aitihaasik kadam he or hamen ise lagu karne kaa mauka mila
 He said that due to India's growing market and strong economy, the whole world is looking at us today
 jetali kii maane to viksit hone ke liye maansikta badalani hogi or aadhe-adhure ravaiye ke saath desh ko nahin badla ja saktaa he
 The Finance Minister said that despite the economic downturn in the world, India is growing fast on the economic front

 kuch dinon main ummid karata hum ki jammu evam kashmir isko lagu kar legaa
 Some people will protest, but democracy goes with protest

 Not only this, now that figure is going to be global and viral
 yah europe main culture war ke nae daur main pahunchane kaa sanket he
 There has been an attitude of European countries that decisions are taken very fast there
 udhaaharan-1
 Spain was also an ally of the United States in the war against terror after the attack on the World Trade Center
 2004 main madrid ke chaar metro steshnon par aatankiyon ne bam dhamaake kiye
 200 people were killed and two thousand were injured

 The general meaning of a progenitor is being a parent
 europe main janata ne dabaav banaakar badi se badi dharmik manyataon ko dhwast kar diya he
 Charlie Abdo and some magazines like that challenged Islamic fundamentalism
 aatankiyon ne ek cond karke us chunauti kaa apni tarah se jawaab pesh kiya
 Now it is the turn of European society
 aaazaad khyal europea samudaay ko apni 'aazaadee' se samjhauta manjuur nahin
 They are also willing to shed blood for this
 duniya main paigambar mohammad ko maanane waalon main unke prati jo bhi aasthaa ho, europe isse beparwaah he
 Some newspapers and magazines in Denmark and the Netherlands have published comments against Islamic fundamentalism
 inke viruddh vahaan chote-bade pradarshan bhi hue
 But Islamophobia in France is reaching its peak after the Paris attack
 logon ke man main kya he, iskaa andaaj patrkaar erik jemor kii kitaab lee suicide frankoi (french suicide) kii bikri ke aankadon se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This book has been the best seller of 2014, written on the results of the increasing population of Muslims immigrating from other countries in France
 in dinon france ke kai musalamaanon ke syria main chal rahi ladaai main shaamil hone or vahaan se france lautne kii khabaren bhi charchaa main hai
 In such a situation, the attack on Charlie Addo could be the reason to ignite the inner fire of the people
 france sarkaar ne pehali baar hajaaron kii taadaad main apane sainikon ko desh ke bheetar tainaat kiya he
 It has been reported that this deployment has been made in the security of sensitive places and Jewish schools in the country
 lekin isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki desh main sambhavit ek badi hinsa ko roka ja sake
 In France, which is facing economic turmoil and unemployment, there is no scope for a new headache
 lekin yah to hua asthai yudhviram
 The 'under-current' of conflict between the French identity and the four and a half million migrant Muslim population will continue to flow
 charlie abdo main phir paigambar mohammad kaa cartoon chhapega
 It is also not surprising that this time it sold 3 million copies in minutes
 or duuniya main is patrika kii online prati viral ho jaae
 Then what will Muslim fundamentalists do? The battle is bound to happen

 Ravichandran Ashwin received the 'man of the Match Award' due to his brilliant performance
 duusare test match main bhi aswin ko 'main of da match kaa aword' mila tha
 So it can be said that because of Ashwin's great performance, Team India has managed to win this series
 tippaniyan What had not happened between the two teams in the 68-year history has happened today
 yah pehali baar hua jab team india ne westeindies ke maidaanon par ek siries main do test match jeetne kaa gaurav hasil kiya
 Team India won the Test series 1–0 against the West Indies for the first time in 1970–71, then in 2006 and 2011 India won the series 1–0 both times, visiting the West Indies
 lekin aaj bharat ne itihaas rachate hue westeindies ke maidan par pehali baar ek test siries main do test match jeetne kaa gaurav hasil kiya
 Not only this, India also won its first victory on this ground
 isse pehle donon tiimon ke bich is maidan par sirf ek match hua tha jo drow rahaa tha
 With this series win, Team India has set another big record against the West Indies and that is the record of winning six consecutive series
 donon tiimon ke bich jitani bhi test siries hui hai, usamen se koi bhi team lagaataar paanch se zyada test siries nahin jeet pai thi, lekin aaj team india ne kamaal karte hue lagaataar chah siries jeetne kaa gaurav hasil kiya
 Earlier, between 1948 and 1967, the West Indies had won five consecutive Test series against India
 68 saal ke itihaas main donon tiimon ke bich jo nahin hua tha vah aaj ho gaya
 It was the first time that Team India had the distinction of winning two Test matches in a series on the West Indies grounds
 1970-71 main team india pehali baar westeindies ke khilaaf test siries 1-0 se jiti thi, phir 2006 or 2011 main bharat ne westeindies kaa daura karte hue donon baar 1-0 se siries jiti
 But today, while creating history, India has the distinction of winning two Test matches in a Test series for the first time at the West Indies ground
 sirf itnaa hi nahin bharat ne is maidan par apni pehla jeet bhi hasil kii
 Earlier there was only one match between the two teams at this ground which was a draw
 is siries jeet ke saath team india ne westeindies ke khilaaf ek or bada record bana liya he or vah he lagaataar chah siries jeetne kaa record
 Out of all the Test series held between the two teams, none of the teams could win more than five consecutive Test series, but today Team India did an amazing job to win six consecutive series
 isse pehle 1948 se lekar 1967 ke bich westeindies ne bharat ke khilaaf lagaataar paanch test siries jiti thim
 With this series win, Team India has set another big record against the West Indies and that is the record of winning six consecutive series
 donon tiimon ke bich jitani bhi test siries hui hai, usamen se koi bhi team lagaataar paanch se zyada test siries nahin jeet pai thi, lekin aaj team india ne kamaal karte hue lagaataar chah siries jeetne kaa gaurav hasil kiya

 On 23 September 2015, the indo-pak war of 1965 completed 50 years
 jab donon padosi is baat ke liye bahes kar rahe hai ki us ladaai main kiskaa palada baari tha tab hamane us yuddh main desh ke liye lard chuke ek purv sainik se unke anubhav ke aadhaar par us yuddh kii asli kahani suni
 Captain Jayant Saranjme may be now 76 years old but the war of 1965 still seems to be tomorrow, when he defeated the attack on Indian army by Pakistani tanks on September 15, 1965 on the strength of his own faith

 padhein captain jayant kii kahani unheen kii jubaanivo kaali raat kaa acid test15 sitambar 1965 kii wo raat hamaare liye acid test kii tarah thi
 Brigadier commander Brigadier AK Luthra gave us just 6 hours to lay 8000 land mines in the Sialkot Cantonment and 168 Infantry Brigade sector in front of it
 isse do din pehle 13 sitambar ko pakistani paton tinkon ne indian army batalian aria main hamalaa karte hue hamaare sainikon dwaara 12 sitambar ko jiti gai kalarvanda post se peeche hatane par majaboor kar diya tha
 This post was important because it had a hilllock on it, which means that its geographical importance is that you are one step ahead of the enemy
 15 sitambar 1965 kii subah15 sitambar kii subah hui oparational meeting main karnal prem kumaar jo ki 8 JAK rifles ke commanding officer the ne batalian ko peeche hataane kaa faisla kiya kyonki unke paas artilari saport nahin tha
 He also clarified about this
 karnal prem kumaar ne 5 agast 65 ko chenab nadi ke paas akhnur main apane 900 main se 300 sainikon ko pakistani tinkon se kuchle jate dekha tha
 The bad memory in Colonel Prem's mind that had broken the morale of the soldiers was fresh
 or ab 13 sitambar ko phir se pakistani paton tinkon ne inke aadamiyon kii pareshaani or badha di thi kyonki inke paas bas rifl or mashinaganen thim
 There was no anti-tank weapon
 jid par ade brigadier e ke lutheralekin brigade commander kuch bhi sunne ko taiyaar nahin the
 He wanted Colonel Prem to complete the work assigned to him
 unhone karnal prem kumaar ko apni paidal sena ke saath aage badhkar kalarvanda post ko phir se apane kabje main lene kaa order suna diya
 Seeing the hidden danger in this work, it was as if the colonel's tongue was lumbered and he started thinking that how can we do these difficult tasks only with the help of infantry
 karnal ne maang kii ki unhen apni batalian aria ke saamne land mine chahie
 Which gives their men some protection during the counter attack
 kahani aath hajaar land mins kibrigade commander luthra ne 8000 mins dete hue second leftinent saranjme ko inhen lagane kii jimmedaari de di
 Second Lieutenant Jayant Saranjme, taking responsibility for this task, demanded additional troops from Colonel Prem's battalion for marking, excavation and transportation of mines
 karnal prem ke paas apane riflemens ko khudaai or dhulaai ke kaam main lagane ke alaava koi doosraa chaara nahin tha, unhone haa kar di
 Apart from 8 JAK rifles, two other battalions also helped in this work
 brigade commander ne aglaa aadesh mins ko trek main hi arm karne kaa diya
 However, the mine is usually armored after putting it in the pit
 is kaam ke liye brigade commander dwaara second leftinent jayant saranjme ko chunane ke peeche kaa kaaran commander kaa leftinent par atoot bharosa tha
 Young Saranjme had planted and removed thousands of land mines only a few months earlier
 yuva leftinent kii sherdilius raat 10 trakon main 8000 land mins ko lod kiya gaya
 Second Lieutenant Saranjme and his 61 soldiers started their journey in those trucks laden with activated land mines, risking their lives
 syah andheri raat main trek sialkot kii taraf badhane laga
 Military drivers drove those loaded trucks out of the ground way efficiently without lighting the headlight
 is movement ko chhipaane ke liye trakon kii parking lite ko bhi band kar diya gaya tha
 The tire pressure of the army trucks was managed in such a way that the trucks do not bounce so that the mines placed in them do not explode and cause a horrific accident
 dushman ko bhanak bhi naa lagisb kuch plan ke mutabik hi hua or sari timen apni-apni manzil par pahunch gayi jisase land mins ko lagane kaa kaam aadhi raat se ek ghante pehle hi nipat gaya
 By this time, the enemy also seemed to be alert
 pakistani army ne mortar daagne shuru kar die the
 There was the noise of machine gun firing, bombs bursting, bullets just blasts everywhere
 aisa lag rahaa tha jaise ghadi roj se kuch zyada hi tej tik-tik kar rahi thi
 As if the sand was slipping from under the feet
 aisi paristhitiyon main kisi aam insaan kaa dil to doguni teji se dhadkane lagata lekin aise halaat se nipatane ke liye trend kiye gaye second leftinent jayant saranjme apane javaanon ke saath teen group main bantakar shant lekin tej raftaar or puure kaushal ke saath ek ke baad ek gadhdhon main land mine bicha rahe the
 The audacity of Land Minesjant, put under the nose of the enemy, can be estimated from the fact that that night he had spread the mines with his jawans to a distance of only 1500 meters from the enemy's camp and the enemy had no news

 leftinent jayant ne badi hoshiyaari se is kaam main pedo kii sukhi pattiyon kii madad lee or pakki sadak par bhi land mine bichhaakar use sukhi pattiyon se dhak daalaa
 For his work, he was awarded the Gallantry Award Army Medal in 1966, but even today his bravery is like an unheard story
 logon ko to pataa hi nahin ki captain jayant ne 1965 kii us ladaai main kya kiya tha
 Captain Jayant also feels that there is nowhere in the records that he had laid 8000 land mines in the 1965 battle

 ’ bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who came in the mode of Lok Sabha elections, today launched an open attack on the Congress and the Gandhi family, forwarding the card of backward caste and poverty and said that the Congress did not declare Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 , Because this elite class feels ashamed to come in the field in front of a backward caste and tea seller like them
 modi ne atyant aakraamak tevar apanaate hue yah bhi kaha ki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne rahul ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar isliye nahin banane diya, kyonki maa ke rup main vah apane bete kii raajnneetik bali ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 Modi mocked Rahul, saying that Congress workers had come to Delhi with great hope
 unhen bataaya gaya tha ki 17 taarikh ko piem pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 Congress workers from all over the country came to take PM, but withdrew the gas cylinder
 bhaajapa kii do divasiy rashtriya parishad kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha, rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar nahin banaae jane ke mujhe do kaaran dikhaai de rahe hai
 There are political reasons, but there is a human reason as well
 jab loksabhaa chunaav main paraajay nishchit dikh rahi he or vinaash saamne najar aa rahaa he to koi maa apane bete kii raajnneetik bali chadhaane ke liye taiyaar nahin hoti he
 So this was the decision of the mother
 
 Save my son
 unhone apni pichhadi jati ke card ko aage badhaate hue kaha ki rahul ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar nahin banane ke peeche ek kaaran yah bhi he kyonki vah ucch kul main paidaa hue hai or kuleen logon main ek bhay yah bhi he ki unke saamne jo ummidavaar he, vah pichhadi jati main paidaa hua he
 Modi said, there is more reason to run away from the race for the post of Prime Minister, that is that the tradition in which he grew up and the family he belongs to and the way he lives, his mind is also feudal
 vah kisi chaay vaale se bhidana pasand nahin karenge
 They sarcastically, they are naamdar, i am a kamdar
 oonch neech kaa maamla he
 Tearing the 'tradition' of not being declared a prime ministerial candidate before the Lok Sabha election result by the Congress, Modi asked where did this alleged tradition of the Congress go when India became independent in 1947? He said that the entire Congress wanted Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as Prime Minister in one voice, but what was the tradition that did not allow Patel to become Prime Minister
 modi ne kaha ki 1984 main jab shrimati indira gandhi kii hatya hui to rajeev gandhi dilli se baahar kolkata main the
 He immediately came to Delhi and was soon sworn in as the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha, parampara kii baat karne vaali congress se main poochna chahta hum ki kya koi sansadeey dal kii baithak hui thi? kya sansadeey dal ne (rajeev ko) pradhanmantri chunaa tha? do-chaar logon ne hadabadi main unhen pradhanmantri banane kaa faisla kar daalaa or aaj hamen parampara kii sikh di ja rahi he
 He said that even about the 2004 Lok Sabha elections' i can say with the claim that no parliamentary party (of Congress) had chosen Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister
 usne sonia gandhi ko is pad ke liye chunaa tha, lekin baad main sonia ne singh ko manonith kar unhen is pad par niyukt kar diya
 Congress leaders cannot escape the truth by talking about parliamentary tradition
 kuch congressi netaaon dwaara unhen ‘chaay vaala’ kahe jane par vyangy karte hue modi ne kaha ki in dinon chaay vaale kii badi khatirdaari ho rahi he
 Today every tea person in the country is walking around staring
 chaay vaale se bhidane main congress ko badi sharmindagi ho rahi he
 They are very honest, people say they (congress) feel ashamed to compete with honest
 congressiyon ke mere bare main aise bayaan unki samantvaadi maansikta ko darshaate hai 
 Continuing the attack on the top leadership of the Congress, Modi said whether to rely on 'tape record' or 'track record'
 congress kii galat nitiyon ke kaaran desh kii haalat kharaab he
 Misrule is at the root of the country's problems
 sirf ‘bill’ (vidheyak) nahin, balki raajnneetik ‘vil’ (ichhashakti) chahie or unhen lagu karne ke liye ‘dil’ chahie
 Bill, we have heard a lot, now we need action, not Act (law)
 kendra or rajyon ke paraspar miljul kar kaary karne kii avadharana ko aage badhaate hue unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri or rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko milakar kaam karne kii jarurat he
 He also said that regional aspirations should not be considered a crisis, but should be considered as an opportunity for development
 kshetreey aakankshaon ko chunauti nahin maananaa chahie, balki uski izzat kerani chahie
 Modi said that as Chief Minister of Gujarat for many years, what is the importance of the federal structure, he understands very well
 har rajya kaa mahatv or uski pidaa ko vah bhalee-bhaanti samaj sakate hai isliye sarkaar banane par bhaajapa sangheey dhaanche ko shaktishaalee banane main ruchi dikhaaegi
 He said that India has not developed equally
 isamen kya kami or kya khot rah gai, use ham dekhenge or dur karenge
 He said that there is some development in the western region of India, but what is the reason that the entire eastern India from the middle is craving for development
 ‘ye asantulan kyon he
 i assure that if i get an opportunity of service, the first guarantee is that the areas of India which are lagging behind, will start working first
 modi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri or rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kii team bane
 a team of central ministers and ministers of states and bureaucrats of the center and states should be formed and all these teams work together for the country
 aam aadmi party ke prabhaav ko sambhavat: dimag main rakhte hue modi ne kaha ki loktantr ab tak pratinidhi vaali rahi, lekin ab samay aa gaya he ki shashan main logon ko adhik se adhik shaamil kar ise jan bhagidaari vaala banaaya jaae
 Targeting the UPA government, Modi said that the country has never seen as many bad days as in the last decade
 bhrashtachar or mahangaai charam par he or har taraf garibi he
 He said that Congress has ruled the country for 60 years and now the time has come to give BJP a chance to work for 60 months
 60 saal aapane shaasha chune 
 
 main janata se apil karata hum ki aapane shaskaon ko 60 saal die, ab is sevak ko 60 maheene dijie
 Now the time of servant has come
 modi ne chutki lee, hamaare vichaar rashtravaadi hai or unke (congress ke) vichaar vanshavaadi
 He also attacked Rahul for his remark that the ticket will be given only to those who have Congress in their heart
 ‘hamaari soch he ki tikat unheen logon ko diya janaa chahie, jinke dil main desh he
 Expressing concern about the status of women, the BJP leader said that what is happening to our mothers and sisters as a cultured society is not worth showing
 mahilaon kii garima or suraksha hamen banani hogi
 Giving the slogan of 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao', he said that what can be a greater stigma in the 21st century than killing daughters in the womb? modi ne kaha ki nari kii taraf dekhne kaa drushtikon badalanaa hoga
 Women need to see us as nation builders (national builders) rather than home makers (housewives)

 The Narendra Modi government has taken a big decision regarding Jammu and Kashmir
 grahamantri amit shah ne rajyasabha main jammu-kashmir ko lekar sarkaar kaa sankalp patr pesh kiya
 Shah said that the provisions of Article 370 giving special status to Kashmir have been removed
 ab iske sabhi khand lagu nahin honge
 Shah has also proposed a reorganization of Kashmir in the Rajya Sabha
 modi sarkaar kaa aitihaasik faisla, pangu hui dhara-370, jammu-kashmir se alag hua ladakhmodi sarkaar ne ab jammu-kashmir ko centre shasit pradesh bana diya
 Also, Ladakh is separated from Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir ke 2 hisson main baant diya he
 Home Minister Amit Shah said in Rajya Sabha that Jammu and Kashmir will be a union territory where assembly elections will be held
 doosraa ladakh centreshasit pradesh pradesh hoga alji ke haath main kaman hogi
 That is, Jammu and Kashmir will now be a Legislative Assembly unincorporated union territory like Delhi and Legislative Assembly like Ladakh, Chandigarh
 modi sarkaar ke faisle ke baad jammu-kashmir ko duusare rajyon se mili zyada adhikaar khatm hi nahin balki kam bhi ho gaye hai
 The state of Jammu and Kashmir has now become like a state like Delhi
 ab jammu-kashmir main chunaav honge or sarkarein bhi hongi, lekin uparajyapal kaa dakhal kaaphi bad jayega
 Like Delhi, the way the government has to get all the approval from the Lieutenant Governor, the same will now be in Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir se judaa Article 370 sthaayee he yaa asthaayee? jaane samvidhan visheshgyon kii rymodi sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad ab bhartiya samvidhan puri tarah se lagu hoga
 Jammu and Kashmir will no longer have its own separate constitution
 jammu-kashmir ne 17 november 1956 ko apana samvidhan paarit kiya tha, vah puri tarah se khatm ho gai he
 Emergency cannot be imposed under the privileges enjoyed by Kashmir till now
 lekin ab sarkaar ke faisle ke baad vahaan immergency lagaai ja sakati he
 Know the history of 35A, after all why there is a ruckus in Jammu and Kashmir that under Article 370, the term of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly was 6 years
 lekin desh kii tarah yahaan bhi paanch saal vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal hoga
 Apart from this, only the permanent citizens of Jammu and Kashmir had the right to vote
 kisi duusare rajya ke log yahaan vot nahin de sakate or na chunaav main ummidavaar ban sakate the
 Now after the decision of the government, citizens of India can become voters and candidates there
 bharat or pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron ke bich pichley maheene baatcheet ke radd hone se katutaa or sanshay kaa jo maahaul bana tha, use abhi durust hona baaki he
 During this time a new debate has started whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is going to New York to attend the UN meeting later this month, should meet Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif there
 vaarta shuru karne ke liye kiye gaye upha samjhaute kii sharmnaak naakaami ke baad ab sanyukt raashtra main puri duniya kii kareebi nigaah bharat or pakistan ke netaaon par rahegi
 There is growing apprehension that in the backdrop of the absence of any formal dialogue process and the ever increasing tension on the border, if there is another major terrorist attack within India, then it will not become a bias of war between the two countries
 sawaal he ki kya modi or sharif ko neuyork main milanaa chahie? haa, beshak milanaa hi chahie
 Neither side should see such a meeting as a defeat
 aamane-saamne kaa samvaad, chaahe kitna hi sankshipt kyon na ho, hameshaa tanaav ko kam karne kaa kaam karata he or bharat ke is paksh ko bhi pusht karata he ki sirf dwipaksheeya samvaad se hi donon deshon ke bich matbhedon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 India has always denied any third party or multilateral intervention, but Modi and Sharif have agreed on many occasions that war cannot be resolved, whether it is fought openly or covertly, small or big
 
 agar koi simit samvaad kiya bhi jaae to sawaal uthta he ki use sarthak prakriya main tabdeel karke tikaaya kaise jaae taaki vah jubaani jang main na badalane paae
 The book Nigerian a Hawk Nor a Dove, written by former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri, released in Lahore this week, describes for the first time the behind-the-scenes dialogue between the two countries between 2005 and 2008
 is par najar daalane se samaj main aata he ki yah prakriya donon deshon ke liye ek raah muhaiyaa karaati he or ummid paidaa karti he ki donon ek duusare ke saath paraspar laabh kii sthiti main rahete hue bhi sanlagn ho sakate hai
 According to the book, Satyander from India — the interlocutor of the two countries — without making the progress of the talks public and shying away from the glare of the media
 lamba or pakistan se tarik ajij—kashmir vivaad par ek samjhaute ke kaaphi kareeb pahunch gaye the
 Aziz was a bureaucrat who was a confidant of the then President Pervez Musharraf and secretary of the National Security Council
 purv rajdoot lamba ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne vaartakar niyukt kiya tha
 The rough outline of the talks held at that time is public but Kasuri has described in this book for the first time how Pakistan handled this dialogue and worked towards resolving the issues of dispute
 kasuri likhte hai ki ajij ne lamba se darjanon baar chupchaap dubai, kathmando or bangkok jaisi jagahon par mulaakaat kii
 Aziz would outline the conversations in these meetings at a meeting convened at Musharraf's Rawalpindi residence after his return to the country
 in baithkon main khud musharraf, kasuri, iesai ke mukhiya (ashfak kayaani, jo musharraf ke baad sena pramukh bane), videsh sachiv or raashtrapati ke chif of staff maujuud rahete
 At these meetings Aziz's draft was changed and he was given a draft of some issues, which he had to talk to Lamba next time
 lamba parade ke peeche kii gai un vaartaon kii prakriya or parinaam ke bare main kuch nahin kehete, jiskaa ve khud hissaa the
 He told India Today, "you should understand that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the decisions taken behind the scenes or to discuss the draft agreement
" back-channel vaartaon se jude kagajaat sarkaar kii sampatti hai
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has handed them over to the current Prime Minister Modi
 '' manmohan singh ke haathon modi ko saunpe gaye parade ke peeche kii baatcheet se jude kagajaat main 150 ghante kii vaarta kaa vistrut record shaamil he jo hajaar pannon main ho saktaa he
 If the left end of this conversation is captured, it can prove very useful for Modi
 is baatcheet main itani pragati hone kii ek vajah yah rahi ki donon deshon ne sirf aatank or kashmir ke 'mulya muddon par hi dhyaan kendrit karne kaa faisla kiya, bajaae iske ki siachin, sar creek or dwipaksheeya vyapaar jaise anya lambit masalon main padaa jaae
 a factor in this was that besides Musharraf being President at the time, he was also the Chief of Army Staff and the ISI was fully with him, thus making this a rare condition of uniformity of military-civilian objectives
 lamba isaki pushti karte hai, ''mujhe parade ke peeche chal rahi baatcheet ko pakistani fouj ke samarthan kii pushti sidhe uske sheershasth str se praapt hui thi
 "the important thing is that during this negotiation, Pakistan did not pressurize any demand related to any referendum or third party intervention
" donon paksh is baat par bhi raji ho gaye the ki sarhadon ko dobaaraa nahin khinchaa jayega or bhavishya ke kisi bhi samjhaute main yah tay hoga ki elosi hi donon deshon ke bich kii vaastavik sarhad he
 Kasuri reveals in the book that the two sides reached agreement in four key areas
 kashmir se hate senah pakistan ne ghati se sena hataane par jor diya, jo ki us vakt kashmir ke kai algaavvaadi guton kii maang thi
 Kasuri says that India had then come up with a proposal in response that Pakistan could not accept its offer until it removed its troops from its occupied Kashmir (including the northern areas)
 donon ore se chali vaarta ke baad yah tay hua ki donon paksh dhire-dhire lekin badi sankhya main aabaadi vaale kshetron se apana sanybal ghataane par sahamat honge ''jo jamini halaat ke hisaab se tay kiya jayega
 "lamba does not even confirm and reject this important concession, but he pointed to this at a seminar in Srinagar in May 2014, discussing all the solutions, including the reduction of forces," 'the essential precondition for the reduction of forces is to eliminate bitterness, violence and terrorism first
 ''aatankwaad par lagaamh kasuri is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki seemaa paar aatankwaad par lagaam kasnaa ek purv shart thi or ve likhte hai, ''hamane pehle hi yah maan liya tha ki bharat ke saath shanti prakriya aage badaae kii baat to dur rahi, vah tab tak tikaoo nahin hogi jab tak elosi ke aar-paar awajahi niyantrit na kii jaae
 "they claim that a major program was initiated by Pakistan to end radicalism among terrorists, cut them off from their current activities and rehabilitate them with the aim of making them a" useful "member of society
 iske sakshya ke taur par kasuri bataate hai ki us avadhi main bhartiya fouj ne khud yah baat kahi thi ki elosi se ghuspaith 'kam hokar shunya tak aa gai he
 The Indian forces, however, believe that it was due to its anti-terror activities and not due to any action by Pakistan, but the fact is still true that the incidents of ceasefire violations on the loc were reduced during that period and During the negotiations there was relatively peace on the outskirts
 swashasana sabase zyada vivaad ke masalon main ek kashmir main swashaasan kii pakistan kii maang thi, jise bharat hameshaa se hi ghati par dilli kii pakad ko kamjor karne kii sajeesh ke taur par dekhtaa rahaa he
 During back-channel negotiations, Kasuri points out that India's emphasis was that Pakistan should do something similar within its occupied Kashmir, including the northern areas of Gilgit and Baltistan
 pakistan is prastaav par thithak gaya tha kyonki beete varshon ke dauraan usne kaaphi suniyojit tareeke se donon kshetron ko ek-duusare se alag kar diya tha
 The northern areas would be strategically vulnerable to them, as they originated from China's Xinjiang
 iske baavjood usne is baat ko mana
 Lamba refuses to comment on the issue of self-government, but it turns out that even if India had agreed to do so, it had no conflict with any provision of the Indian Constitution
 sanyukt pranalih itnaa hi vivaadaaspad masalaa sanyukt pranali kaa tha jise kasuri vaarta kaa ansh bataate hai, ''jiske madhyam se donon pakshon ke kashmiri saajha hit ke vishisht kshetron main sahyog kar sakate the or jahaan bhartiya or pakistani kisi na kisi rup main maujuud rahete
 Musharraf was enthusiastic about the process and saw it as another plot to gradually loosen the grip of the Indian government over the valley
 lamba is masale par kuch nahin kehete lekin srinagar main die unke sambodhan se yah saaf he ki bharat jahaan is pranali ko lekar vichaar karne par sahamat tha, vahiin use sirf ek paramarshdaata ikai ke rup main hi hona tha jiskaa kaam paryaton, yatra, tirth, vyapaar, swasthya or shiksha jaise saamaajik-aarthik masalon kii nigaraanee karnaa tha
 Kasuri says that if all these steps were implemented, the biggest achievement of India and Pakistan would have been to sign a completely new treaty of peace, security and friendship that would "pave the way for lasting peace
" ' kasuri daawa karte hai ki parade ke peeche chali is vaarta ko donon deshon kii ore se rajnatik samarthan hasil tha, jisamen bharat se bijepi bhi shaamil thi
 In his book, he recounts a meeting with National Security Advisor Brijesh Mishra in 2007 during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's time in which he said, "kasuri sir, we had to do it and will do it, you walk slowly 
 ''kasuri kaa daawa he ki back-channel samjhaute par dastakhat ho gaye hote lekin 2008 main mumbai par hue hamale ne rishton ko bahut peeche dhakel diya
 Lamba challenged this, saying that "the dismissal of the Chief Justice of Pakistan at the hands of Musharraf in 2007 slowed down the process
" '' iske baad sthitiyaan musharraf ke niyantran se phisalati chali gayi or baad main pakistan main hukumat badal gai
 Regarding Kasuri's entire assessment, Lamba says that "what was really in the agreement does not put it in the right perspective, especially what he has written about self-government, joint system and army withdrawal
" ho saktaa he ki ek anbhavi rajaneta hone ke naate unhone jaan-boojh kar aisa likhaa ho
 However, it is quite clear that the two countries had made substantial progress in many issues and had come very close to an agreement on Kashmir, it is a different matter that such developments and destiny were not acceptable
 musharraf ke hukumat se baahar hone ke baad lamba ne asif jaradaari kii sarkaar ke saath parade ke peeche baatcheet jari rakhi or modi ke satta main aane se pehle tak sharif ke saath bhi yah baatcheet jari thi, haalanki isamen pehle jaisaa utsaah nahin rah gaya tha
 Modi and Sharif can still connect this broken thread
 shaayad lamba-ajij samvaad kii tarah hi parade ke peeche kii baatcheet kaa tarika kahin zyada kargar rahegaa, bajaae puure ho-halle ke saath kiye jane vaale aupchaarik kootnithik samvaad ke

 Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, said that his credibility has fallen due to serious questions on the economic data given by the government in the country
 lihaaja jarurat he ki ab aarthik aankadon ko ekatra karne or taiyaar karne kaa kaam kisi swatantra agency se karaayaa janaa chahie
 In an exclusive interview to the India Today group in Davos on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Rajan said that the issue of GDP, employment and many economic data including the country has become suspicious
 in aankadon par sawaal uthaane vaale kuch logon kii vishwasaneeyata par shaq nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 So this is a serious problem for both the government and the country
 is samasya ke nidaan ke taur par rajan ne kaha ki jarurat he ki desh main aarthik aankadon ko ekatra karne or pesh karne kaa kaam kisi swatantra agency ko diya jaae jisase aarthik akalan sahi ho or sarkaar kii nitiyon ko sahi aankadon ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya jaae
 Rajan pointed out that altering the economic data due to political reasons creates the problem of real assessment and needs to be avoided
 gauratlab he ki bataur rigerv bank governor bhi 2016 main raghuram rajan ne desh kii jidipi aankadon par sawaal uthaaya tha
 Rajan raised this question when the Modi government decided to change the formula from 2004-05 to 2011-12 with changes in the formula for GDP estimation at the end of 2015
 rajan ne is badlaav par aapatti darj karte hue kaha tha ki rigerv bank apni nitiyon main jidipi aankadon kaa istemaal nahin kar sakati kyonki is tarah jidipi formule ko badalane se ek jatke main 2015 kii jidipi 5
 7% to 5%
 3 fisadi ho gai
 Rajan warned that manipulating economic data for political gains in this way could prove to be detrimental to the economy
 gauratlab he ki raghuram rajan world iconomic forum ke sammelan main shariq hone ke liye daavos main he
 Rajan said this in an exclusive interview given to India Today in Davos

 But after his term ended in 2016, the Modi government of NDA did not offer Rajan a new term, forcing him to go to the US
 aarthik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki rajan kii do took pratikriyaaon ke chalate modi sarkaar se unka talmail thik nahin tha
 After Rajan's tenure, the Modi government appointed Urjit Patel, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, as the new governor, but due to controversies with the government, Patel resigned from his post without completing his term

 In an attempt to address the concerns of students, parents and teachers on the implementation of the Continuous Composite Evaluation (CCE) system in place of the traditional examination in the Tenth Board, the CBSE said that it aims to bring forth the creative talent of the students

 CBSE President Vineet Joshi said, "the board has clearly stated that such work should be conducted in groups in schools and should not be made a burden on parents
" sisii kaa uddeshy chaatro kii rachanaatmak pratibha ko aage laana he
 It will be more fruitful and less diligent if the students and teachers initially outline these tasks
 ’sutron ne bataaya ki sibiesai ke sangyaan main yah baat bhi ai he ki shikshakon kaa ek varg yah mahasoos karata he ki nai vyavastha ke kaaran unhen paathya yojana, fermative pariksha se judi gatividhiyon kaa dizin or anya paathya saamagree taiyaar kerani padati he jisase unka kaam kaaphi bad gaya he
 The board has said that any new system is a new experience
 shikshakon ko haalanki abhi unka kaary thodaa chunauteepurn jarur lag rahaa he lekin jald hi vah iskaa lutf uthaa sakenge, iske liye kaarykram ke shuruuaat main hi yojana taiyaar karnaa mahatvapurn hoga
