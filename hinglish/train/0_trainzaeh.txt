 jammu kashmir ke halaat ko ‘chintajanak’ qaraar dete hue bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha ki rajya prashasan puri tarah se vifal ho chukaa he or samprag sarkaar pakistan samarthit algaavvaadiyon ke samaksh aatmasamarpan karne ko he
 a day before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's all-party meeting called to discuss the situation in violence-ridden Kashmir, Advani opposed any move to soften the controversial Armed Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA) or remove troops
 unhone kaha ki agar aisa hota he to iske myne ‘bharat kii ekta ko todane kii islamabad kii ranneeti ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar dene se honge
 Taking a dig at both the state and the central government, Advani said that not only is Omar Abdullah government the reason for the worsening situation in Kashmir, but the UPA government too is in a dilemma and adopting a lukewarm attitude
 bhaajapa kii ek kaaryshaala ko sambodhit karte hue adwani ne kaha, ‘har ek bitate din ke saath hamaari yah ashanka prabal ho jaati he ki samprag sarkaar pakistan samarthit algaavvaadiyon ke samaksh aatmasamarpan karne ko he
 Advani said that there is talk of 'political solution' in Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki algaavvaadiyon ko uchit jawaab dene ke bajaay sarkaar suraksha balon ko bura bataa rahi he
 The AFSPA is constantly being talked about to bring down the norm and remove the forces
 yah or kuch nahin, balki 1947 ke baad kii bharat kii ekta ko todane kii islamabad kii ranneeti ke aage samarpan he
 Advani said, 'pakistan's military rulers have been dreaming of this since the defeat in 1971 war
 yah sharmnaak he ki congress ke ek pradhanmantri ne bharat ko us yuddh main aitihaasik jeet dilaayi, vahiin duusari congress sarkaar kashmir main bharat ke khilaaf pakistan ke chhadam yuddh ke aage samarpan karne kaa kaam rahi he
 The BJP leader said that there is talk of giving maximum autonomy to Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki iskaa arth nikaala jaye to iske myne jammu-kashmir ko 1953 ke purv kaa darja dene se honge
 Instead of removing Article 370, the UPA government seems to be willing to end the years and decades of gains we have collectively made in Kashmir
 aisa isaliye he kyonki samprag sarkaar ke paas ichha, drushtikon, patibaddhta or sakshmata kii kami he
 Advani said, 'I want to remind the UPA government that when the so-called autonomy resolution was passed by the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in June 2000, the then (vajpayee government) at the Center rejected it outright
 ’unhone kaha ki us samay vaajapeyi ne tippanee kii thi ki prastaav ko sweekaar karne se ham puraane daur main laut jaayenge or raashtra kii akhandta ke saath rajya ke logon kii aakankshaon ko susangat banane kii naiysargik prakriya ulat jaayegi
 If the government had accepted it, it would have encouraged a trend that is not favorable for national unity
 adwani ne kaha ki ham sab sabhi rajyon ko sanghavaad kii avadharana ke mutabik vrihad shaktiyaan dene ke pakshdhar hai lekin swaittata ke naam par ham kashmir kii akhandta kii prakriya ko ulatney nahin de sakate
 In his separate address on the situation in Kashmir, senior party leader Arun Jaitley said, 'we want peace to return
 lekin shanti tab tak nahin lautegi jab tak algaavvaadi mukt rahenge or sena ke haath bandhe rahenge
 He said that the bjp's strategy is very clear - strengthen the security scenario and do not keep the evil elements autocratic

 However, soon after the results, the price of crude oil fell to the lowest level of the current decade and the biggest relief for the central government in the last four years came from the disappearance of inflation
 ab 2019 ke chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 Is inflation going to knock again
 kendriya rigerv bank maan rahaa he ki aane vaale varsh main mahangaai kaa khatra bad rahaa he
 Is the new year bringing inflation? If the RBI is seeing signs of inflation, then this inflation is also bringing tough economic challenges for the new government

 My 13 year old daughter Ankita has blood cancer
 is baat ko 45 din ho chuke hai, jab diagnosis ke nattejey ne hamaare jivan main bhuuchaal laa diya tha, lekin meri patni or mere paas ab bhi itani himmat yaa kalejaa nahin he ki use iske bare main bataa saken
 If he asked if he would die, what answer would i be able to give him, while i myself have to exert my full strength to remove my mind from this bitter truth? My name is Basavaraj Panch Kaveri, i am a child of four
 i am a father and live in a village in Belgaum district
 maine yadi agle 30 dinon main 18 lakh rupee kaa bhugtan nahin kiya, to cancer meri sabase badi beti ankitha ko nigal jayega
 Any help i can give as a donation will help me pay for my daughter's treatment
 kuch dinon pehle tak to maine kabhi yah kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki main apane ghar se kai kilometre dur bengalooru main rahoonga, apni beti ko aspataal ke bed par dekhte hue or usko bachaane kaa upaay sochate hue
 My daughter Ankita was such a different person before coming to this hospital
 vah kaaphi urjavan, chanchal or jivan se bharpoor ladki thi
 She loved animals living in our neighborhood farm, so when she was not in school, i would always find her playing with animals
 kaaphi lambey samay se maine use isi tarah dekha he
 But now the wretched atmosphere of the doctors, nurses and the hospital has made him quite calm
 mujhe ab bhi vah khaufnak din yaad he
 Ankita had just returned from school on June 19, saying that she was suffering from severe pain in her legs and abdomen
 maine uske lalaat par haath rakhaa to dekha ki vah bukhaar se tap rahaa tha
 But this onset of fever finally made me sit in front of HCG hospital doctor Amit ji, who was trying to explain to me the meaning of the term 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia'
 main peshey se kisaan hum, isliye is baat ko samaj nahin paa rahaa tha ki ham par kya gujri he, jab tak doctor ne ‘blad cancer' shabd nahin bolaa
 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of blood cancer that causes massive damage to the body by disrupting the production of normal cells such as red and white blood cells (RBC and WBC) and platelets, first in the bone marrow (bone marrow) and later in other healthy organs
 And eventually leads to death
 doctor ne hamen bataaya ki is tarah ke cancer kaa yadi samay se upachaar nahin kiya jaae to yah kaaphi teji se failane lagata he
 So Ankita's life can be saved only if her chemotherapy session is started as soon as possible
 is samay to mere dil ke dhadakanon kii raftaar thodi kam hui he, mujhe haal main hi yah khabar sunakar thodi raahat mili ki iskaa koi rasta nikal saktaa he
 But after what i was told further, i started thinking of myself as helpless
 is upachaar kii laagat to itani zyada he ki hamane itnaa jivan bhar nahin kamaaya or na hi dekha he
 The amount required to save my daughter is staggering, 18 lakh rupees
 mujhe yaad he ki jab maine pehali baar yah suna to sann rah gaya tha
 After this, nothing else came to my mind what the doctors are saying next
 meri beti ko cancer he! mujhe kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki aage mujhe kya karnaa he
 In such difficult times, only the support of the people around you can make or break you
 main is maamle main khushkismat hum ki mere aise tamaam rishtedaar or shubhachintak hai jinhone apni yathashakti jo kuch bhi ho saktaa he, aarthik madad kii
 He helped me by showing my huge heart, but in spite of this, it was nothing in front of the cost of treatment
 main khud maheene main mahaj 2000 rupee kama paata tha or vah bhi band ho gaya, kyonki mujhe yahaan bengalooru main apni beti ke saath rahanaa tha
 i sold all my jewelry and valuables
 meri patni khan-paan kaa chota sa kaarobaar karke har hafte kareeb 300 rupee kama leti he, lekin isse bhi bhala kya hone vaala tha
 The hospital is in Bangalore, so i started living here with my wife with a small room whose rent was only 300 rupees
 doctoron ne kaha ki hamen is shahar main abhi kai maheene or rahane padenge, jiskaa matlab he ki pehle se hi zyada ho rahe hamaare kharche or badhate jane hai
 Little by little i raised about Rs 4 lakh
 main isse zyada or kuch nahin kar saktaa tha, lekin yah hamaari jarurat ke aadhe se bhi kam tha
 We have used all our resources
 ab main kya karun? main apni beti ko bachaane ke liye paisa kahaan se laaun? uske bina yadi main ghar gaya to uske bhai-bahanon kaa saamana kaise karuunga?mujhase jo bhi ho saktaa tha, maine vah sab karke dekh liya he
 Now my final hope is to match people who have read my story so that i can save Ankita
 har raat jab main sota hum to ishwar se yahi prarthana karata hum ki koi chamatkaar ho jaae-main ishwar se kahata hum ki yaa to meri beti kaa cancer dur kar den yaa uske upachaar ke liye dhan de den
 Now it is getting harder day by day to be around Ankita and be able to stop my tears
 vah apane skool waapas janaa chaahati he, apane bhai-bahanon ke saath samay bitaana chaahati he or apane doston ke saath khelnaa chaahati he, lekin isaki jagah use dard bhare tamaam test karaane pad rahe hai, vah apane is ‘pet ke sankraman' ke sabase lambey upachaar ke khatm hone kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 i feel like i am a failed father
 yah jaanate hue ki yadi samay se paisa nahin juta to main use ganvaa saktaa hum, main uske saath zyada se zyada samay bitaane kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 What should i do next? Should i continue trying to raise this impossible amount to save his life or spend the limited time of his life with him? You can help Basavaraj by donating to his fund manager

 The government can pay attention to the voice of the people troubled by the huge increase in rail fares
 samajha jaataa he ki charanbaddh tareeke se upnagareey trainon ke kiraayon main katautee kii ja sakati he
 This news has been given by an English newspaper
 patr ke mutabik sarkaar upnagareey relon ke kiraayon main kami kar sakati he
 For this, instead of increasing the fares in one stroke, it will be increased slightly

 In metros like Mumbai, this will provide considerable relief to the daily commuters
 bataaya jaataa he ki shivasena kii naaraazgi se sarkaar ko pareshaani hui or is par vichaar hona shuru hua ki is bhaar ko kaise kam kiya jaae

 vahaan har din 75 lakh log un trainon se yatra karte hai
 In fact, the government gives a large subsidy on the fares of suburban trains
 yah sabsidi bahut baari pad rahi he
 So the government has increased this and it has reduced it significantly
 lekin isse dainik yatriyon ko kaaphi ksht hua
 It is now being thought that these fares should be increased a little at present

 lekin ab sarkaar ko yah dekhnaa hoga ki kaise is badhotari kii takalif ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 It is likely that this increase should be done little by little instead of simultaneously

 He also said that Virat Kohli may have the ability to respond to Australian sledding , but his attitude puri team ko mushkil ho sakati he isliye team ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vah jo kar rahe hai unhen shaayad vaisaa nahin karnaa chahie
 Most fans who like classic cricket ie Test matches also believe that in this Gentleman's game, focus cricket par hi hona chahie
 The Australian cricketer has always been an expert in sledging
 vahaan khilne vaali sabhi tiimon ko is mushkil kaa That is why we have to face Virat Kohli, the aggressive way to deal with it is that of many experts nazar main seemaa ko langhane jaisaa he
 Even cricketers like Rahul Dravid have been responding to Australian sledding, but the way Virat Kohli is presented aa rahe hai kahin vah had se zyaada to nahin? ye sawaal shaayad team kii kamyaabi kii kasuti par parkhaa jaae
 As far as viraat kohli kaa sawaal he maujuuda australian daure par unki 115, 141, 19, 1 or 169 ranon kii pariyon ke baad un par sawaal Not easy to lift

 It is also to be remembered that Virat represents the generation next, who is not afraid to announce what his girlfriend's name is? He does not care about anything else while sending a flying kiss to his girlfriend by hitting a half-century and a century during the match
 is peedi ko ye dar nahin ki bure vakt main ye naakaam hone par media uske peeche pad saktaa he yaa dost taane de sakate hai

 With this, Devendro's dream of finishing at least a bronze medal by reaching the semi-finals could not be fulfilled
 bhartiya dal haalanki is bade score vaale mukaable ke parinaam se naakhush dikhaa or usne daawa kiya ki referi ne bhartiya mukkebaaz ke khilaaf kadaa ravaiya apanaaya
 Devendro was also warned once in the second round
 devendro ke baahar hone se mukkebaaji ring main bhartiya chunauti samaapt ho gai
 In the women's section, MC Mary Kom also lost in the semi-finals but managed to win a bronze medal in women's boxing in the Olympics for the first time
 darshakon ke apaar samarthan ke bich burness ne pehle round main 7-5 se badhat hasil kii
 He tried to dominate Devendro from the beginning
 donon mukkebaajon ne aakraamak andaaj main mukaable kii shuruyaat kii or ek duusare par khub mukke barasaaye lekin irish mukkebaaz ko unke anubhav kaa phayda mila
 In the third and final round, both boxers again tried to dominate each other but Devendro looked more desperate to return
 burness tab tak majboot badhat par the or unhen tisare round main chetavanee mili, lekin unhone devendro ko vaapasi kaa mauka nahin diya
 The stadium, filled with Irish supporters, began to rejoice with Burns' victory

 India's foreign coach BI Fernandes said after the bout, "too many mistakes were made against our boxers
" vah (burness) sahi jagah par hit nahin kar rahaa tha lekin tab bhi use ank mil rahe the
 It was not right
 unhone kaha, refring bahut kharaab thi
 Not only in this bout but in most of the bout of Indians, the referring was not good
 yah dukhad he lekin hamen isi ke saath aage badhanaa hoga
 We are very disappointed
 hamen yahaan padak milanaa chahie tha
 In this way, India's boxing campaign at the London Olympics also came to an end with only one bronze medal in hand like the Beijing Olympics
 tippaniyan The 20-year-old Devendro fought with full might but could not overcome his more powerful opponent and lost 18–23 in the Light Flyweight (49kg weight class) in the men's category
 isse devendro kaa semifinal main pahunchakar kam se kam kaansya padak pakkaa karne kaa sapana puraa nahin ho paaya
 The Indian contingent, however, was unhappy with the result of this high-scoring match and claimed that the referee took a tough stance against the Indian boxer
 devendro ko duusare round main ek baar chetavanee bhi di gai thi
 Devendro's exit ended the Indian challenge in the boxing ring
 mahila varg main emasi mairicam bhi semifinal main haar gayi lekin vah pehali baar olympic main shaamil mahila mukkebaaji main kaansya padak hasil karne main safal raheen
 Amidst the overwhelming support from the audience, Barnes took a 7-5 lead in the first round
 unhone shuru se hi devendro par dabadabaa banaae rakhane kii koshish kii
 Both the boxers started the match in an aggressive manner and had plenty of punches against each other but the Irish boxer got the benefit of their experience
 tisare or antim round main donon mukkebaajon ne phir se ek-duusare par haaavee hone kii koshish kii lekin devendro vaapasi ke liye adhik betaab dikhe
 Byrnes was on a strong lead by then and received a warning in the third round, but did not give Devendro a comeback
 irish samarthakon se bharaa stadium burness kii jeet ke saath hi khushi main jhuumane laga
 He will take on China's top seed Shimming Jou in the semi-finals on 10 August
 jou ne quarter final main kazakhstan ke birjaan jakhipove ko 13-10 se haraaya
 The Indians, however, again pointed fingers at the points system, claiming that the wrong attitude was adopted against Devendro
 bharat ke videshi coach biai fernadis ne bout ke baad kaha, hamaare mukkebaajon ke khilaaf bahut adhik galtiyaan kii gayi
 He (barnes) was not getting hit in the right place but still getting points
 yah sahi nahin tha
 He said, the referring was very bad
 keval isi bout main nahin balki bharatiyon kii adhiktar bout main refring acchhee nahin rahi
 It is sad but we have to move forward with this
 ham bahut niraash hai
 We should have got a medal here

 In Goa, an information worker has started his work in this direction just two days after the Central Information Commission (CIC) decided to bring political parties under the purview of the Right to Information (RTI) Act
 sarkari karmchaaree rah chuke kashinath shetty ne bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko artiai ke tahat arji dekar party se khanan companiyon se mili nagdi or chande ke alaava uske apane vidhayakon evam padaadhikariyon dwaara die jane vaale anshdaan kii jaankaree maangi he
 Shetty said, 'an application under RTI has been submitted to BJP
 aisi hi argiyaan congress, rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) or maharashtravaadi gomantak party (emjeepi) or goa vikaas party (jivipi) jaisi kshetreey partiyon ko bhi saunpi jaaengi
 'the information sought by Shetty under RTI includes the account of' donations received by BJP from Vedanta / Sesa Goa and other mining companies'
 goa main khanan companiyon or raajnneetik dalon ke bich cholii daaman kaa rishta haalanki jag jaahir he, phir bhi iskaa dastavejon main kahin zikr nahin he
 Sesa Goa Pvt
 Ltd
, the largest iron ore exploitation and exporting company in the state
 li
 In 2009-10, it paid Rs 85 lakh to BJP and Rs 30 lakh to Congress
 isi avadhi main emjeepi ko do lakh rupee, jabaki shivasena ko ek lakh rupee mili the
 It is a sad coincidence that this donation was given at a time when mining in Goa was at its peak and illegal mining was taking place
 shetty ne yah bhi poocha he ki kya bhaajapa ke har vidhayak ko anshdaan karnaa hota he, 'yadi haa to kripaya vistrut byoraa muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 All the election manifestos have been sought through the application from 1999 to 2012 to see if the promises made in the election manifesto were fulfilled after the BJP came to power
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki party kaa kendriya netritv siaisi ke aadesh kaa adhyayan kar rahaa he or pradesh ikai ko abhi tak vahaan se artiai argiyon par karrwai ke tauratrike par koi nirdesh nahin mila he
 The BJP leader said that RTI needs time to revise its organizational structure and organize information for disposal of applications
 dilli main sattarudh aam aadmi party (aap) ke vidhayak amanatullah khan ko raahat dete hue patiala house court ne buudhvaar ko ek mahila ke saath gaiyr iradatan hatya ke maamle main bari kar diya he
 In this case of 2016, the Patiala House Court found that the woman's statement about the case in which the FIR has been lodged against the MLA has repeatedly changed in the court
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki is mahila ne saal 2016 main 21 july se 26 july ke bich main lagaataar court main apane bayaan badale or har baar die gaye bayaan pichley bayaan se ekadam ulat the
 Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan got the benefit of changing the statement of the complainant woman repeatedly in Patiala House Court
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki mahila ke bayaan andeh janak he or court is par vishwaas nahin kar saktaa
 a case was registered against MLA from Okhla, Amanatullah Khan in July 2016, alleging that the woman accused the MLA of killing her and tried to deface the woman by insulting her
 mahila dwaara exiaar jamiya nagar ke police stesan main darj karwaai gai thi
 In this FIR, several sensational allegations were made by the woman against MLA Amanatullah Khan
 police ko darj karai gai exiaar main mahila ne vidhayak par aarope lagaaya tha ki vidhayak ne naa sirf use jinda jalaane kii dhamkee di balki uskaa rape karne kii bhi dhamkee di gai
 In this incident on July 10, 2016, the woman, who lives in Jasola area, went to MLA Amanatullah Khan's house over the problem of power cuts
 bijli kii samasya kaa to koi nidaan nahin hua, lekin mahila kaa aarope tha ki bottla house sthit apane ghar main vidhayak ne usko jabardast daraaya dhamkaaya
 However, when the woman reached the court, her statements were contrary to the statements made in the police
 usne kaha ki usko dhamkee vidhayak ne nahin balki vidhayak ke ghar main maujuud kisi duusare vyakti ne di thi jo kabhi is cese main tres hi nahin ho paaya
 The second reason for the acquittal in the mla's case was the Swift car, alleging that the MLA was riding and the car tried to crush the woman, but MLA Amanatullah Khan said there was no Swift car after him and in court The police failed to prove that the MLA had any Swift car

 rahul ne apane twiterprofile ko apadet kar member of indian neshnal congress or member of parliament kar diya he
 With this change in Rahul's Twitter account, the celebratory phase which started on his resignation after the results of Lok Sabha elections has also ended
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi ne apni profile main badlaav karne ke pehle apana 4 pannon kaa istipha patr saarvajanik karte hue samarthan ke liye kaaryakartaaon or samarthakon ke prati aabhaar prakat kiya tha
 Rahul said that as the president of the party it was my responsibility to lose in the 2019 elections
 isliye jimmedaari lete hue maine party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha diya
 He said that the responsibility and accountability of defeat will have to be taken and if i keep myself away from this responsibility then it will not be right
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha he ki vah agle adhyaksh kaa naam aage nahin karenge
 It is an honor for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation
 i owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love

 Prime Minister Imran Khan was scheduled to address a public meeting at the Municipal Corporation Ground in Skardu today where he was about to announce a major package for the development of the area, but due to bad weather, Imran had to cancel the public meeting

 The Congress party has started working hard on the ground in view of the byelection in 20 assembly seats in Delhi
 beete vidhansabha or nigam chunaav main bhi jameen par mehnat kii gai, lekin party kii bhitari foot se kaaryakartaaon main acha sandesh nahin gaya or nateezon main party puri tarah pichad gai

 sabhi logon ko muft bijli or pani nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Due to inflation, the household budget of women has been disturbed, the youth are not getting jobs
 yadi dilli ko bhavishya main or sundar banvaanaa he to congress ko waapas satta main laana hoga
 AAP is a government of false promises, not of the public
 AAP: Addressing the conference, Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken said that during Sheila Dikshit's government, the environment in Delhi was very clean and development was also taking place in Delhi at a rapid pace
 jab se arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ai he tab se na to pension mil rahi he or naa hi dilli main sadak or pul ban rahe hai

 In preparing for their exams, math is bothering the students the most and children are scared of this subject
 lekin aapako bataa den ki agar aap ek yojana ke tahat maths kii padhai karenge to aap aasaani se bina kisi dikkat ke maths ke kathin se kathin sawaalon kaa hal kar sakenge
 Let us know how to prepare maths
 
 
 - agar aap ganit main kisi topic ko nahin samaj paa rahe hai, to use chhodkar aage badhane ke bajaae usee par focus karen
 Suppose you are reading algebra and you are having trouble understanding it, then do not leave it
 yah kabhi nahin sochen ki ise chhodkar duusare chapter ko padhanaa behatar rahegaa
 Keep these things in mind with the revision, good marks will come in the exam- Actually all the chapters of mathematics are connected with each other
 agar aap pehle vaala koi chapter chodenge to aage ke chapter main aapako or kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Therefore, after working a little more, prepare the chapter which is in hand
 - kitabon main die gaye udhaaharan ko jarur hal karen, kyonki pariksha main in udaahranon ke aadhaar par kai sawaal puche jate hai
 If you look at this solution, then you will understand how the questions of that chapter will be
 - kitaab ke alaava aap udaahranon ko samajhane ke liye dividi, sidies, audio casets kaa sahaara bhi le sakate hai
 Create easy questions at the beginning of the chapter
 step dar step aap kathin sawaalon ko bhi hal karne lagenge
 It is better to practice mathematics than to read a book
 board pariksha main karnaa he top to yah Routine banaakar karen padhai- agar aapako ganit ke koi sawaal samajhane yaa hal karne ke liye kahe to turant uske liye taiyaar ho jaaen
 The more practice you do, the more you will benefit
 aap jab kisi ko bataane kaa prayaas karenge to aap khud bhi use behatar tareeke se samajhane lagenge
 - Always keep your solution clean
 isse aap sawaal banaate samay kanphyus nahin honge
 - Memorizing the formula is most important in mathematics
 agar aapako vah yaad nahin he to aapkaa samay bhi barbaad hoga or aap sawaal hal bhi nahin kar paaenge

 Despite the Planning Commission accepting the Suresh Tendulkar Committee report stating the number of poor in the country last week, according to economists, the biggest question still remains that what should be the scale when deciding the number of poor in the country
 gat varsh disambar main aayi suresh tendulkar samiti kii report ko 17 april ko yojana ayog ne sweekaar kar liya
 In fact, this report is also considered important because the government is considering using the data of this report to identify the beneficiaries of the proposed National Food Security Bill
 suresh tendulkar samiti kii report ke mutabik, desh main garibi rekha se neeche jivan yaapan karne waalon kii sankhya kul aabaadi kii 37
 2 percent
 is 37
 19 per day for 2 per cent
 3 rupee yaa usase kam kamaane vaale shahari or pratidin 15 rupee yaa usase kam kamaane vaale gramin shaamil hai
 Renowned economist Jayati Ghosh says, 'various committees have their own take on the number of poor
 apni siforishein di hai lekin sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki jo aabaadi 15 yaa 19 rupee pratidin se adhik nahin kamaati he, kya sirf vahi garib he
 "he said," The Tendulkar Committee report is directly related to the Food Security Bill
 lekin itani badi or mahatvakankshi yojana ko aankadon main baandhna bemaani hoga
 'tendulkar committee report where number of poor 37
 2 fisadi bataati he, vahiin 2007 main aayi ajarun sengupta samiti kii report main garibon kii sankhya 77 fisadi bataayi gayi thi
 In the Tendulkar Committee, per capita daily income figures have been given separately for urban and rural areas

 NC constituted by Ministry of Rural Development
 saxena samiti ne garibon kii sankhya 50 fisadi bataayi thi
 At the same time, according to the World Bank report, 41 in India
 6 fisadi log garib hai
 Jayati says, 'you cannot tie poverty statistics in the country so easily in any income limit
 kam keemat or nishchit maatra main khadyann hasil karnaa har vipann vyakti kaa buniyadi adhikaar he
 There should not be any stumbling block or statistics
 ’ is report ke bare main puche jane par makapa netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha, ‘hamaara ab bhi yahi ruukh he ki garibi ke aankade ajarun sengupta samiti kii report ke mutabik hi maane jane chaiye
 We do not agree with the numbers given in the Tendulkar Committee report
 ’ unhone kaha ki jab baat garibon ke liye kisi yojana kii ho to sarkaar kaa najariya vyapak hona chaiye
 In the report of the Sengupta Committee, the number of poor has been stated to be 77 percent and we consider it more correct
 jeenyu ke ‘centre for studies of soshal system’ main sahaayak professor dow
 Himanshu explains, 'the good thing in the case of Tendulkar Committee is that it has given different scales of determining the number of urban and rural poor in contrast to the data of Sengupta Committee, Saxena Committee and World Bank
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘lekin agar sarkaar 578
 Urban people earning Rs 80 per month and 446
 68 rupee pratimah kamaane vaale gramin vyakti ko hi garib maanane ja rahi he to kya khaadya suraksha sunishchit karaati uski yojana main ek yaa do hajaar rupee pratimah kamaane waalon ko garibon kii taadaad main shaamil nahin kiya jaayegaa
 In the past, when the scale of poverty was determined on the basis of calorie intake per capita, then the number of people living below the poverty line was found to be 27 percent

 lekin unhone apane jeevani lekhak james bozewel ke saamne kya kaha tha, isamen duvidha kii khaas gunjaaish nahin he
 But there was a slight skepticism about what he meant
 jahiraa taur par usamen sthaneey raajnneeti kii gunj ho sakati he
 Some believe that the outrageous doctor's anger must have descended on the 'patriotism' hypocrisy of the American colonialists who were waging a war of independence from England, and referring to life, liberty and everything else in their declaration of independence
 But there did not seem to be any contradiction in their ways of keeping those whites as slaves
 haalanki dow
 Whatever Johnson's intentions are, his words are insufficient for our present purposes
 deshbhakti to kul milakar bahut adhik saumy vichaar he isliye hamen rashtrawaad par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he—kyonki rashtrawaad—johnson ke tark ke mutabik—lucchon kii pehali oot ho saktaa he
 From Victor Orban in Hungary to Netanyahu in Israel, Rajab Tayyib Erdogan in Turkey to Mattio Salvini in Italy, and from trump to self-proclaimed 'nationalists' growing up in our own country — ostensibly nationalism around the world Dominated
 or 'raashtra-virdohi' 'shahari naksali' jab desh ko tabah karne or sthapit vyavastha ko chhin bhinn karne main vyast nahin hai to ve iske alaava khaas kuch kar nahin sakate ki ve halaat ko bardaasht karen
 Although i have no intention of getting into such inflammatory cases, i will confine myself to the uniqueness of these words — Nationalism (patriotism) and Patriotism (patriotism) —and find the difference between them
 patriotism purana vichaar he
 It originated from 'patria' or fatherland (sorry, sisters, 'matriatism' (the reverse of nationalism or patriotism) was not seen from that perspective, right?) However the important point here is that patriotism is usually referred to as a person's love for his country, love towards his countrymen, etc
 is understood
 yah 'desh' nishchit rup se 'raashtra' nahin he
 a brilliant expression of this sentiment is in William Butler Yeats's poem 'an Irish Airman Forsies His Death'
 yeats kii is kavita main rashtriya kii jagah sthaneey ko zyada ahmiyat di gai he
 This enables us to comment on another feature of 'patriotism' —because it is the love of something for which one is willing to die — as in the famous statement of the Roman poet Horace, whom Wilfred Owen called his The poem 'world War One' reads - "dulche et decorum est, pro patria mori
" '' oven kii kavita mustard gas hamale ke kaaran dam ghutane se maut kii ore bad rahe ek sainik kii pidaa kaa varnan he, jo horess kii is baat ke saath samaapt hoti he: apane desh ke liye jaan nyochhavar karnaa sukhad or uchit he
 In the incitement of 'patriotism', the affectionate affliction - 'the sand of the desert has turned red, and what i have done for your England, my own England' '- replaces different feelings when we enter the field of' nationalism '
 Let's enter
 yahaan, deshbhakti ko darshane vaali vishesh chizon ke liye prem ke bajaae rashtrawaad, kuch had tak amoort dharna 'raashtra' ke liye gaurav kii bhaavana he
 And 'dying' does cover patriotism, but equally important is that nationalism is a bed for which a person is ready to kill someone, and perhaps it is necessary to kill
 lihaaja, deshbhakti, anivaary rup se, rakshaatmak, ruudhivaadee he; rashtrawaad swabhaav se aakraamak he
 Here, what i am trying to say is that it expresses a bunch of Hindi words very beautifully
 is prakaar, nesanalism main 'nesan' ke liye hamaara sabase acha shabd raashtra he or, mere liye, kathin, samanvit vyanjan—shtr—mujhe vah sab bataata he jo main yahaan bhaawanaaon ke saath ho rahe khel main dekhtaa hum
 The word that reflects the spirit of country is 'country' —but the final 'sh' still sounds far away — and it is indigenous 'des' that seems to be associated with the essential intimacy of patriotism
 kishori amonkar ke 'aavo mhaaro des' main 'des' ko agar 'desh' kar den to uskaa ras khatm ho jayega
 And there is a beautiful melody that i call des — though i have heard it as a country
 mujhe dar ke saath pratiksha he ki raag raashtra sunne main kaisaa lagegaa—yakeenan vah nagaadon kii aawaaj jaisaa hoga
 Lots of people shouting slogans
 or vividh awaajen—haddiyon ko tode jane kii awaajen, salaakhon main fansaa maance
 
 
 All romanticism will be destroyed
 aamtaur par, is tarah ke sandarbh main log 'bharat ke vichaar' ko thopate hai—jo ki vibhinn rup se drudh, luptpraaya, prashansit, nindaneey he
 Although i understand its literal difference, it is advisable that we work with the 'spirit of India'
 mujhe ummid he ki bahut jald ham deshbhakti ko apni vishisht bhaavnaatmak swar dene vaale sthaneey lakshan dekhenge
 In this way, the 'india' i feel fond of is inextricably linked with my whereabouts in the Hindi heartland — consisting of countless people with different thinking, different beliefs, different cultures — convoys settled, Hindostan Became maanavtaa ke prati lagaav he jo har sardiyon main nadi ke kinare swabhaavat: ikattha hota he
 But there is also heatstroke in the heat, to avoid which people gather behind the chickens of the reeds
 ye chik behad ruudhivaadee samaajon ke romani palon se jude hai
 The mango orchard (amarai) also has a privacy dilemma — and the eastern organ music has a gentle alluring charm — Sawan ki rimjhim, swing: Barsan lagi kari swings in Badria / Bagia
 beshak, baagon kii bas ab yaaden rah gai hai, lekin yahi vah 'bharat' he jo deshbhakti ko jataata he
 But i think the emotional and visual content of patriotism of people from different parts of the country will be unique in itself
 or vah thik hi he
 On the other hand, nationalism cannot accommodate this diversity according to its nature — and an attempt to encapsulate it into some sort of victorious singularity — the "new India" —is not without violence
 mujhe raashtra raag shuru hone kii aawaaj sunai de rahi he—isaki aawaaj ghati main pravesh karte juuton kii thap jaisi sunai detii he—lekin is bich lakhon kaaron ke windo par ubhar ai cruddh hanuman kii chhavi se hi mujhe bhavishya kaa andaja lag jaataa he
 The 'india' i feel fond of is inextricably linked to diversity — consisting of countless people with different thinking, different beliefs, different cultures — the convoys settled, the Hindostan became
 bharat mata kii chhavi kaa bahut dilachasp kramik vikaas hua he, vah avanindranath tagore kii painting kii komal yuvati se hindutv kii kalpana se ubhari dhwajadhari yoddha yuvati kii chhavi ban gai he
 i suspect that the image of "india", which is no longer India, is thundering around us — swaying in the air, angry punches — it cannot be embedded in any fantasy of "woman"

 Often such posts are viral on social media, claiming that Lal Bahadur Shastri was poisoned
 to kabhi daawa kiya jaataa he ki unki maut ke peeche america kii khufia agency siie kaa haath tha
 Though the mysterious death of Lal Bahadur Shastri could not be revealed, but senior journalist and blogger Vishnu Sharma has certainly discussed the CIA connection behind Shastri's death in his recent book

 com / owonjkn1nm— ANI (@ani_news)october 16, 2016 BJP MP from Bhopal, Pragya Singh Thakur, who is often in the news for his controversial statements, made another big statement on Friday
 unhone navaratri par laudspikar or deje der takbajaane ko lekar kaha ki kya saare niyam kaayade kanoon kya sirf hinduon ke liye hai
 We will not consider it
 is navaratri par ham laudspikar-deje sab chalaayenge
 There are no guidelines
 jab unhen laudspikar ke maamle main court ke faisle kii yaad dilaai gai to unhone kaha ki unhen court kaa yah faisla manjuur nahin he
 Please tell that Sadhvi Pragya was talking to reporters in Bhopal
 isi dauraan puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main sadhvi pragna ne yah jawaab diya
 There are no guidelines, as long as Pooja is the speaker-dj, will now challenge the court too @ BJP4MP @ bjp4india MP? @ sadhvipragya_mp @ pankajc_inc @ INCMP @ ndtv @ ndtvindia @ officeofknath # shubhomahalaya # latamangeshkar # bhagatsinghjayantipic

 com / ej0cz80tm2 Significantly, this is not the first time that Sadhvi Pragya has made a disputed statement
 isse pehle sadhvi pragna ne kaha tha kibabari masjid giraae jane par unhen garv he
 Pragya Thakur told a TV channel that there is no regret of demolishing the structure of Babri Masjid, we are proud to demolish it
 hamaare prabhu raamji ke mandir par apshisht padaarth the, unako hamane hataa diya
 "in Malegaon blast, accused Pragya Thakur further said that we are proud, our self-respect has awakened, we will also build a grand temple of Lord Ram Ji
 dhaancha todakar hinduon ke swabhimaan ko jaagrit kiya tha
 There, by worshiping God by building a grand temple, you will enjoy
 " bataa den ki bhaajapa ne pragna thakur ko bhopal se ummidavaar banaaya tha
 Pragya had earlier given a controversial statement on Hemant Karkare, the Mumbai ATS chief who was shot dead by terrorists
 maamle ke tool pakadaney par unhone bayaan waapas lete hue maafee bhi maang lee thi
 In fact, Sadhvi Pragya made this remark on a TV channel during the campaign in Bhopal on Saturday and because of this once again the incident of Babri Masjid demolition has become fresh in political circles
 tivi channel se sadhvi pragna ne kaha tha, 'ram mandir nishchit rup se banaaya jayega
 It will be a grand temple
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya vah ram mandir banane ke liye samaysima bataa sakati hai, to pragna ne kaha tha ki ham mandir kaa nirmaan karenge
 After all, we even went to demolish the structure (babri Masjid)
 sadhvi pragna ne babari masjid main apni ahm bhoomika par bhi prakaash daalaa or kaha tha ki maine dhaanche par chadhakar todaa tha
 i am proud that God gave me opportunity and strength and i did it
 ab vahiin ram mandir banaaenge
 Within hours of Sadhvi's statement, the Election Commission served a notice to her
 notice die jane se pehle sabhi raajnneetik partiyon ke liye ek adwijuri bhi jari kii gai thi, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki ek-duusare ke prati jo dheron shikaayatein mil rahi hai ve is ore saaf-saaf ishaara kar rahi hai ki netaa bhadakaau or vivaadit bayaan de rahe hai, jisase samaaj main nafrat or asangati fail sakati he
 Earlier, BJP candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat Sadhvi Pragya Thakur had made objectionable remarks on the then Mumbai ATS Chief Hemant Karkare during the recent 26 / 11 Mumbai attack
 media se baatcheet main unhone bataaya tha ki unhone karkare se kaha tha ki tumhaara sarvanaash hoga
 After this there was a lot of controversy over Pragya's comment
 baad main unhen apane bayaan waapas bhi lene pade
 s Jaishankar has got the post of Union Minister directly, this is the first time in itself but the person who got a cabinet position like this 10 years ago could have been Nandan Nilekani
 unhen rahul gandhi ne maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kaa pad dene ke liye bulaayaa tha
 However, the proposal was withdrawn at the last moment after a rethink of Sonia Gandhi and the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while Nilekani was all set to fly to Delhi
 neeche diya gaya pustak kaa ansh padhein
 
 
 We meet him in a conference room in Bangalore
 us vakt aisa lag rahaa tha jaise bengalooru ke shandaar mausam ne aadhaar vivaad se uthi garmi ko or uske prakope ko khatm kar diya he
 Nandan was accused of creating surveillance Frankenstein, created by anti-aadhaar activists
 supreme court ne is maamle main nirnaayak rup se faisla sunaaya or aaj nandan ko apane mishan ke puure hone kaa bada santosh he, jo ek sarkaar ke tahat shuru hua or us sarkaar main jaakar puraa hua jo pichhali sarkaar se vaicharik taur par vipareet he
 The whole journey started with a phone call
 nandan kehete hai, 2009 main mujhe rahul gandhi kaa phone aayaa
 He called me on the day of the results when the Congress returned with more seats
 yah upie sarkaar ke liye apratyaashit duusari jeet thi, jisamen congress ne akele 206 siten hasil kii thim
 He asked me if i am interested in becoming the Human Resource Development Minister of India? We need someone who is from outside
 maine apane sahyogiyon se baat kii or un sabhi ne jawaab diya, ''thik he yaar
 "then i told them that they were ready
 nae mantrimandal ke shapath grahan ke din main bengalooru main tha
 Now i did not know about these funds that for politics you will have to stand in Delhi and wait for your name to be announced
 subah 11 baje mujhe yah poochne ke liye phone aayaa ki kya main dilli main hum
 i am an IT fellow
 maine kaha 'nahin
 'I was in Bangalore
 unhone poocha ki kya main shapath grahan ke liye shaam 5 baje tak aa saktaa hum to maine unhen bataaya ki mere paas privet jet nahin he
 After this, i started to see an aircraft for Delhi
 mjedaar baat ye he ki es
 M
 krishna, jinhen videsh mantri ke pad ke liye chunaa gaya tha, ve dilli ja rahe the
 He too was in Bengaluru but his house was very close to the airport, so he managed to reach
 or is bich main hawaii jahaaj kii vyavastha karne kii koshish main juta tha
 Nandan says, 'rahul Gandhi called again and said sorry, you are not being included'
 Later i thought that Sonia Gandhi might have thought that i am a corporate man and will not understand the problems of the poor
 
 vahiin, manmohan singh ko laga hoga ki main ek technocrat hum, rajaneta nahin
 So handling HRD ministry will be very political for me
 yah ek pramukh kaam tha- ve ise bengalooru ke maamuli se aadmi ko nahin dena chaahate the
 'nandan laughed
 'ye rahul kaa vichaar tha, lekin ise thukraa diya gaya
 i returned to my old job
 'kitaab main, nandan nilekani ne yah bhi bataaya ki aadhaar yojana kaise viksit hui or unhen narendra modi samet desh bhar ke logon ko kaise samajhaana padaa
 Nandan remembers meeting the then main opposition leaders of BJP, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, and said that his biggest challenge was the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, who, coincidentally or luckily, is the biggest advocate on a day to day basis
 became
 nandan yaad karte hai, 'bhale hi gujarat main sab kuch taiyaar tha, mukhyamantri modi ne roleout ko manjuuri nahin di thi
 Then i got a message to meet him and so i went to Gujarat
 ' maine sochaa, "mujhe is project ko safal bananaa he, main kisi se bhi mil saktaa hum
 He said, "the meeting was scheduled for half an hour which lasted one and a half hours, and then the Chief Minister took pictures with Nandan Nilekani, which he also shared later
 'mujhe lagata he ki ve logon ko dikhaanaa chaahate the ki main unase milane gaya tha
 So, i sat there with him and he told me everything in his journey of life till his debut as a chai wala on the 2002 riots
 mere jate hi unhone project ko manjuuri de di
 'I asked,' Did you ever feel disappointed that you got stuck in the middle of a political game? ' This is a game
 bharat main sudhaar leniyar fishan main nahin hote hai
 It is a two-step forward-one-step backward process
 yah ucch gatividhi or purna niskriyata ke samay kii avadhi hoti he, lekin yahi sach he
 This is the nature of politics
 jab ucch gatividhi kaa samay hota he, to aap yathasambhav se adhik kar jate hai
 That's when it goes into inactivity, you spend your time
 kuch to hoga
 Ministers or bureaucrats will change
 yadi aap lanbaa khel khel rahe hai, to aap is prakaar kii chizon se nipat sakate hai
 To keep the UIDAI scheme away from politics, Nandan and his team also chose a name that was non-political
 'main aisi waisi XYZ yojana nahin chahta tha, isliye hamane saavdhaneepurvak bahut research kii or "aadhaar" mila, jiskaa arth he neenv; aapaki pahchaan hi neenv he
 More importantly, the word 'aadhaar' works in almost all Indian languages
 lekin raajnneetikaran se bachane ke prayaas main, nandan bataate hai ki kaise iskaa ek-ek akshar raajnneetik ho gaya
 "the plan's slogan is" the right of the common man
 " us samay aam aadmi party dwaara 'aam aadmi' ko badha-chadha kar dikhaane se pehle tak yah naaraa aksar congress istemaal karti thi
 Only two people paid attention to it - Sonia Gandhi and Narendra Modi
 jab main modi ji se mila, to unhone kaha, "aapane congress kaa naaraa kaa kyon prayog kiya he?" phir ek din, shrimati gandhi ne mujhe bataaya ki unka maananaa tha ki main aadhaar par bhaajapa ke rangon kaa istemaal kar rahaa tha, jo logon ko bheja ja rahaa tha
 i said that it is the color of the tricolor
 mujhe unhen dikhaane ke liye namoonay lene the ki ve vastav main rashtriya dhvaj ke rang the
 Now a card was going for a billion people here, so obviously a person would be worried about its handwriting, symbols and colors
 vah kehete hai, phir bhi puure system main mere liye aashcharya kii baat ye thi ki is bare main keval sonia gandhi or modi ji ne iske bare main poocha!"
 
 
 
 
 
 or phir nandan nilekani or aadhaar ke liye ek mahatvapurn mode aayaa
 The 2014 election and his decision to contest an MP from his home seat, Bangalore South
 vah bhaajapa ke swargeey anant kumaar se chunaav haar gaye
 Nandan's election defeat was probably his first failure in anything
 yah anubhav unhone bebaaki se sunaaya
 Even Aadhaar had a role in it
 '2014 ke chunaavon main, mujhe bhaajapa ne 'aadhaar main' ke rup main sabake saamne laayaa - yahaan tak ki modi ji ne bhi aakar mere or aadhaar ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya
 Well this is politics
 'vyaktigat haar ke alaava, nandan or aadhaar ke liye unke vijan ke liye upie kii haar zyada chintajanak thi
 He recalls, 'I panicked because there was no other advocate for Aadhaar
 vipaksh main baithi bijepi kii kii aadhikarik sthiti ise khatm karne kii thi
 The Ministry of Home Affairs, which had remained so far away, suddenly saw an opportunity and started interfering
 antat: maine pradhanmantri se mulaakaat kii or aadhaar va usase desh ko hone vaale phaaydon ke bare main charchaa kii
 Then they asked me the same general question, one of which was that if Bangladeshis got it? i told him that it is not a citizenship number but an identity (ID) number
 maine unhen bataaya ki isse sarkaaraki yojanaon kaa laabh sidhe labhaarthiyon tak pahunchane main madad milegi jisase sarkaar ko kaaphi bachat hogi or bhrashtachar bhi kam hoga
 At that time, fortunately oil prices were also very high
 isliye sarkaar bachat par dhyaan de rahi thi
 In the end he became the biggest advocate of the base
 pradhanmantri kaa aadhaar ko samarthan dena or lagbhag ise techover kar lene ke baad alag tarah kii pareshaaniyaan huin
 The Congress hastily closed it
 rahul gandhi ke ek phone kol ke saath shuru hui yatra ke baad ab kol karne vaale vyakti khud nandan the
 'I sent him a message urging him to adopt this project as it was perhaps the biggest achievement of UPA-2
 lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 He clearly states that he feels that Congress has squandered this opportunity

 President and Democrat candidate Barack Obama also attacked his opponent fiercely in the rally after giving tough competition to his Republican rival Mitt Romney in the second round of the presidential election in America
 udhar, romany ne bhi raily main obama ke khilaaf hamalavar tevar apana rakhe the
 Obama, while addressing a rally in Iowa on Wednesday, said Romney's five-point program to strengthen the economy was in fact a one-point plan that would benefit only the rich
 vahiin, romany ne varjeenia main samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki obama ke paas duusare kaarykaal ke liye koi agenda hi nahin he
 If Obama is re-elected, American middle-class families will pay $ 4,000 more tax annually
 tippaniyan In a poll conducted immediately after the debate between Obama and Romney on Tuesday, though people favored Obama, critics say it is not going to clear the picture of the race for the White House
 bahes ke duusare daur main romany par baari padane ke baad obama haalanki adhik utsahit hai
 He is expected to participate in the third and final round of debate in Boca Raton, Florida on October 22 with renewed energy
 obama ne iova main buudhvaar ko ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki arthvyavastha ko majbootee dene ke liye romany kaa paanch sutri kaarykram darasal ek-sutri yojana he, jo dhani logon ko hi phayda pahunchayegaa
 At the same time, Romney addressed supporters in Virginia and said that Obama has no agenda for a second term
 yadi obama dobaaraa nirvaachit hote hai to america madhyamvargeey pariwaron ko salanaa 4,000 dollar adhik kar chukaana hoga
 The comments obama or romany ke bich mangalvaar ko hui bahes ke turant baad karwaae gaye surveykshan main haalanki logon ne obama kaa paksh liya, lekin samikshakon kaa kahana he ki isse white house ke liye daud kii tasviir saaf nahin hone ja rahi

 gharelu vankhede stadium main saurashtra ke saath jari ranjai trophy ke final mukaable ke pehle hi din gendbaajon ke shandaar pradarshan ke dam par mumbai ne apni pakad bana lee he
 For the first time in 75 years, after reaching Saurashtra for the first innings of 148, Mumbai scored 19 runs without losing any wickets in their first innings till the end of the day
 salaami ballebaaj wasim jafar 11 or kaustubh pavaar chaar ran par naabad laute
 Jaffer now needs 72 runs to become the highest run-scorer in Ranji history
 mumbai ke paas ballebaaji kaa bharpoor mauka he or saath hi uske paas 40veen baar khitaab jeetne kaa bhi svarnim mauka bhi
 All he needs to do is to cross the total of 148 runs in his first innings and then take his score to the height from which Saurashtra batsmen cannot dare to cross it
 yah mauka mumbai ke paas he or maujuuda farm ko dekhte hue uske liye yah kar paanaa mushkil nahin
 The Mumbai bowlers did a brilliant job under the leadership of Dhawal Kulkarni (24 / 4) and bowled Saurashtra for 148 to honor their captain Ajit Agarkar's decision to bowl first after winning the toss
 pich main maujuud nami kaa phayda uthaakar mumbai ke gendbaajon ne bhojankaal tak 50 ranon par hi saurashtra ke paanch wicket jhatak liye the lekin arpit vasavadaa (55) or kamalesh makvaana (26) ke bich chathe wicket ke liye hui 64 ranon kii saajhedaari ne saurashtra ko 100 ranon se kam par out karne kii unki muhim ko nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Vasavada hit nine fours in his 146-ball knock while Makwana faced 83 balls with four fours
 iske baad jayadev unadakat ne bhi 22 ranon kii pari kheli lekin inke alaava saurashtra kaa koi or ballebaaj mumbai ke gendbaajon ke anushaasan ke aage nahin tik sakaa
 Vasavada was dismissed for 114 runs total
 makvaana kaa wicket 115, shaury shandilya (4) kaa wicket 141 or unadakat kaa wicket 142 ranon ke kul yoga par gira
 Siddharth Trivedi (2) was dismissed as the final wicket
 match ke pehle satr main kulkarni ne do ran ke kul yoga par saurashtra ke salaami ballebaaj sagar jogiyani ko chalata kar diya tha
 Jogiani could score one run
 shitanshu kotak or rahul dave ne duusare wicket ke liye 10 ran jode
 The partnership was nascent with Kulkarni bowling out Dave (3) to give Saurashtra another setback
 yah wicket 12 ke kul yoga par gira
 This was followed by Vasavada on the wicket, who continued to take on the Mumbai bowlers till lunch but Saurashtra suffered a third blow as Kotak (14) on a total of 36 runs
 yah wicket dawolkar ko mila
 After Kotak, Sheldon Jackson (5), who was on the wicket to support Vasavada, managed to reach Saurashtra in the final but he forgot his role at this crucial stage
 unka wicket 45 ran ke kul yoga par gira, jo kulkarni ko mila
 Five runs were scored in the total that Davolkar gave a great gift to his team by dismissing guest team captain Jaydev Shah (0)

 bharat main pehali baar 1994 main dikhaai gaishekhar kapur kii film da bandit quinko aam taur par media kii acchhee pratikriya nahin mili
 Especially the one-sex scene was criticized in which Phoolan Devi falls over her lover Vikram Mallah
 sameekshak or film nirmaataa pankaj butalia ne kaha ki yah seen isliye gale nahin utarataa kyonki aisa nahin lagata ki koi ‘dehati’ aurat is tarah se pyaar karegi
 The debate over sexuality continued with the controversy surrounding The Bandit Queen, but the urban middle-class woman came to the center of the discussion in this case and she benefited from it
 yah aam dharna barkaraar rahi kimahanagar kii aurat sex sambandhi gatividhiyon main kaaphi aage hejbaki chote shaharon kii roodhiwaadee tip kii aurat sankochi hoti he yaa sex sambandhi gatividhiyon main pahal karne main use shame aati he
 The India today-nielsen Sex Survey has contributed to the study of the desire and practice of Indian women, especially women from small towns, to have sex with men
 is prakriya main isane na sirf aupniveshik dharanaon or nitiyon kii vajah se pichhali ek shatabdi main bani bhartiya auraton kii rudh chhavi balki aupniveshik kaal ke baad ke yug main bane gender gyaan ke rashtravaadi bakhaan or vidwata ko bhi dhwast kiya he
 Women of small towns no longer feel sad about imagining how free women of the west are in terms of sex
 survey se pataa chalata he ki ab ve khud bhi apni jhijak todakar sex kii usee daud main shariq hai
 In India, much is known about premarital relationships, except that people have to cry about it
 lekin is surveykshan ke nateezon se pataa chalata he ki yuva auraton kii kaamuktha par sakht nigaraanee ke baavjood rishte banaae jate hai or inamen se kuch fisadi rishton kii parinti sex main hoti he
 For example, 21% of all women in small towns have gone out on a date with a male
 haalanki, mahanagaron kii auraton kaa aankada 38 fisadi he
 In unmarried women, this difference in the figures of metros and small cities reduces considerably
 survey main shaamil chote shaharon kii 22 fisadi avivaahit auraten mardon ke saath date par gai hai jabaki mahanagaron kii aisi auraton kaa aankada 30 fisadi he
 Yes, as the level of intimacy increases, the gap further decreases
 mard ko chuumane or 16 se 18 varsh kii umr ke bich pehali baar chumban kaa swaad chakhne vaali avivaahit auraton kaa aankada dekhen to chote shaharon kii auraten purushon ke saath romance ko aage badhaane ke maamle main mahanagaron kii auraton se peeche nahin hai
 In fact, when it comes to the age of women dating, women in small towns tend to be ahead of women in metros: 30 percent of women in small towns going on a date did so for 16 to 18 years While only 19 percent of the women of metro cities of the same age group had gone on a date
 lekin vivaahit or avivaahit, donon tarah kii auraton ke aankadon kii tulana karen to yah tasviir badal jaati he: us umr main pehali baar dating par jane kaa avivaahit auraton kaa aankada mahanagaron or chote shaharon donon main 31 fisadi rahaa he
 But in small towns, the percentage of married women who admit to going on a date for the first time at the age of 16 to 18 years is about 33 percent, while in metros it is only 13 percent
 is baari antar kii vajah kya he? koi yah anumaan laga saktaa he ki chote shaharon kii auraton kii shaadi jaldi hoti he, lekin yah dikhaane kii unki ichha ki ve bhi dating par ja chuki hai, asal main khud ko aadhunik dikhaane se judi he, isliye ve apane pati ke saath baahar jane ko bhi ‘‘dating’’ bataati hai
 Relationships before marriage can be seen everywhere in metros and small towns
 ek pati or patni vaale vaivaahik dhaanche ko ab bhi yon gatividhiyon kaa sweekrut rup mana jaataa he
 Eighty percent of the women surveyed said that their first sex partner was their husband; 82 percent had sex with only one person in their lives and 90 percent had never had an extramarital affair
 badi sankhya main auraten sex ke maamle main apane pati se baraabar kii saajhedaari kii ummid karti hai or unhen aisa mil bhi rahaa he, saath hi 60 fisadi ke bahumat ke saath auraten yah daawa bhi karti hai ki sex ke maamle main unka bhi baraabar kaa dakhal rahata he
 Although the expression of sexuality outside the scope of marriage is very low, the couple's bedrooms are no longer boring places in small cities of India
 chote shaharon kii auraton ke jivan or dimag se jude sex ke bare main saaf tasviir dikhaane ke maamle main yah survey ullekhneey he
 66 percent of women believe that sex plays an important role in their relationship
 23 fisadi yon fantasiyaan bunane kii baat maanati hai or 30 fisadi ne kabhi-na-kabhi porn film dekhi he
 Nearly half of the women who watch porn movies watch such movies every two months
 haalanki zyaadaatar mahilaon ne yon sambandh banane ke dauraan pojishan ko lekar prayog karne main zyada ruchi nahin dikhaai he, lekin kam se kam 10 fisadi ne yah mana ki unhen sex ke dauraan upar rahanaa pasand he
 Incidentally, the figure is similar in case of women in metros
 sex or kaamuktha main is sakriy dilchaspee kaa aankada sex ke bare main baatcheet kii anicchhuk mahilaon kii sankhya ke baraabar baithta he
 76 percent of the women surveyed do not discuss sexual matters with their family and the number of people willing to consult a sex therapist alone or with a spouse is also not very large
 sex ke bare main soochna ke sabase bade strot ke rup main dost or tivi ubhare hai
 It is not surprising that 34% of women in small towns surveyed believe that porn may have some role in sex education because of this reluctance to openly discuss sex
 sage-sambandhiyon ke saath sex or samalangikta ab bhi chote shaharon ke liye sabase badi varjanaayen hai
 Reports of adulterous relatives' adultery come from time to time — Pinky Virani's Bitter Chocolate can be cited in this case — yet the survey has found little challenge to the popular notion of 'home as paradise'
 samalangikta ek or ‘varjit’ kshetra he
 17% of the women surveyed said they would forgive the husband for having an extramarital affair to keep the family together
 inamen se 63 fisadi auraton ke saath vivahetar sambandh ke liye pati ko maaf karne kii baat maanati hai, lekin sirf 14 fisadi auraten samalangik rishte ke liye pati ko maaf karne ko taiyaar hai
 80 per cent are not willing to accept the bisexuality of women (sex with both men and women) and 79 per cent reject homosexuality
 haalanki mahanagaron kii auraton ke maamle main yah aankada kramash: 67 or 64 fisadi he
 In the survey, when talking about their attitudes and habits related to sexuality, men overstep the figures to show the extent to which women are attracted to them
 kai baar dating par jane ke maamle main mardon kaa pratishat zyada hone kaa matlab yah ho saktaa he ki unhen auraton ke mukaable sex sambandhon ke maukey zyada mili hai
 But the survey data provide strong indication that men and women either exaggerate or undermine their experiences and they are more or less the same for both
 is tarah chote shaharon ke mardon-auraton ke dating par jane ke aankade baar-baar kai maamalon main ek jaise lagate hai
 Even with the question of who you had sex with firstly, men and women in small towns have the same figure
 survey se sabit hone vaali mahilaon kii yon abhivyakti kii spashtataa bhartiya auraton ke bare main banaai gai us chhavi se takaraati he jinamein unako yaa to sati-savitri or pativrata bataaya jaataa he yaa kaamuk or sex kii bhukhi
 The image of women from small towns revealed by this survey presents a highly complex picture that goes against such simplification
 agar sabhi aankadon ke maddenjar koi aasaan nishkarsh nikaal liya jaae to un aankadon ke byore use fouran chunauti dete hai
 The survey is also important for another reason: the study of sexuality in India has been steadily accepted over the past two decades, but as social anthropologist Manuela Ciotti points out, people in small towns are aware of the prevalent heterosexual (opposite sex sex) methods
 Has limited information
 is tarah yah survey sambhavit sawaal-jawaab kii puri ek nai raah ke daravaaje khol detaa he or nishchit rup se ise hi isaki mukhya uplabdhi bhi mana janaa chahie
 The first effect of Aamir Khan's show, which shocked the hearts of the people, is seen on the female feticide

 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has confirmed this news
 or unhen ye bharosa diya he hai court ke chif justise, jo fast trek court banane ke liye sahamat ho gaye hai
 It is clear that the effect of Aamir's efforts is beginning to be seen, Aamir Khan met Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot a day before in Jaipur and its effect is also visible with the consent of the judge regarding the fast track court
 itnaa hi hi nahin is maamle ko lekar ashok gahalot shuukravaar subah 11
 There will also be meetings with ngos, medical and home departments at 30 pm
 kanya bhrun hatya se jude maamalon ko teji se nipataane ke liye fast trek court kii jarurat he
 Because most of the cases are buried in files for years and the gang of murderers are left free to crush the young buds before they come into the world
 duusari baat baat sonography centres kii, jahaan ajanmi bacchiyon ko maut kaa farmaan sunaae jane kii sajeesh kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Complaints against them often arise
 lekin kanoon kii sust chaal kaa phayda uthaakar ye saaf batch nikalate hai
 The Gehlot government has indicated that black acts of these sonography centers will no longer be tolerated
 darasal satyamev jayate sho main khaas jor rajasthan par diya gaya tha or kaarykram ke baad hi rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne aamir khan se milane kaa elaan kiya tha
 He also kept his promise and met Aamir Khan in Jaipur
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main sabase mahatvapurn gathbandhan he jediu-bijepi gathbandhan
 Presently, this coalition is in the hands of power
 haalanki gathbandhan ke netaa or vartmaan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar apni jeet ko lekar aashwast najar aate hai lekin unhen kahin na kahin lalu-paswan ke gathbandhan se chintaa bhi he
 If seen, both parties are together for their own convenience
 pichley dinon patna main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke postaron se mache bavaal ke baad to aisa lag rahaa tha ki jaise nitisha bhaajapa se duuri bana lenge
 but that did not happen
 donon hi dalon ko pataa he ki agar wo alag hue to donon ko hi munh kii khaani padegi
 On the one hand, while Nitish has the support of Muslims, on the other hand BJP has the support of hardline Hinduists and the business class
 is tarah ye donon dal ek duusare ke poorak kii bhoomika nibhaate hai
 As far as the agreement is concerned in this alliance, the BJP has been making more compromises in it because it does not have a vote bank like Nitish or say caste base
 duusare, nitish kaa raajnneetik vyaktitv bahut bada he or bihar main bhaajapa ke paas aisa koi netaa nahin he jo uski barabari kar sake
 Although Nitish is claiming his victory, he cannot say for sure that his alliance will win
 vaise bhi tikat paane ke liye dal badalane vaale netaaon se rajya ke sabhi dalon ko do chaar hona padaa he
 Therefore, it is difficult to accurately predict which side the camel will sit
 is gathbandhan ko rajd-lojpa gathbandhan se acchhee khaasi chunauti mil sakati he kyonki 2009 main 18 siton par hue upachunaav main is gathbandhan ne nitish ko sochane par majaboor kar diya
 The Special Forces have now been launched in the fight against the Taliban trying to capture the city of Ghazni in Afghanistan

 afghanistan ke liye ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn shahar gazani par niyantran banane ke liye taliban pichley hafte se surakshabalon or nagarikon ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 Taliban militants have been entering the city for 5 days and killing people
 kai chor se kiye hamale ke baad baagiyon ne shahar ke kai hisson par kabja kar liya he
 This is a demonstration of great power from the Taliban which has penetrated so far inside the city, located only 120 kilometers from the national capital, Kabul
 america ne afgaan balon kii madad ke liye sainya salaahkaaron ko bheja he
 If the 270,000 population escapes from Ghaznihaath, it will be a big win for the Taliban
 yah dakshini praanton se kabul ko jodne vaale ek ahm rajmarg se bhi sampark tod degaa
 Defense Minister Bahrami said that about 1,000 additional troops have been sent to the city to help prevent Ghazni from going into the hands of the Taliban
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki taliban ke 12 netaaon samet 194 vidrohi maare gaye hai
 The dead include Pakistani, Chechen and Arab foreign fighters

 ' Former Railway Ministers today criticized Railway Minister Sadanand Gowda over the Railway Budget and called it 'rail of the rich' and 'modi's gadget'
 unhone kaha ki bajet main kuch bhi nayaa nahin he

 According to sources, Hizbut Tahrir has been working with the Indian Mujahideen in the area for the last three years
 taharir kii bihar main bhi acchhee-khaasi maujuudagi he
 According to sources, this nefarious relationship of the Indian Mujahideen begins in 2010, when IM activated its Darbhanga and West Bengal modules
 hizbut taharir ke log border ke ilaake main hai or indian mujahidin ke logon ko jarurat ke mutabik border ke idhar-udhar laate, le jate he
 According to sources, the terrorists have carried out these blasts to give a message about violence against Rohingya Muslims
 ibi ko kuch din pehle is baat kii soochna mili thi ki lashkar rohingya muslim ke kuch logo ko baudhon ke khilaaf trening de rahaa he
 These blasts have been done in a hurry
 aatankwaadiyon ne bodhgaya or dharmashala main se suraksha ke lihaaj se aasaan target maanate hue bodhgaya ko hi chunaa
 For a Darbhanga module, it is easy for the IM to explode in Bodh Gaya due to the distance of just four hours
 sutron ke mutabik, iem or taharih ke modul ke bich kai meeting hone ke bhi saboot hai
 Hizbut collects most of its funds from West Asia as compared to Saudi Arabia, and through this it also funds IM
 iem ne is ilaake main apni pakad majboot bana rakhi he
 This can be gauged from the fact that 14 terrorists, including Fasih Mehmood, have been arrested from this area in the last three years
 bodhgaya main lagaae gaye bam 2008 tak ke dhamaakon main indian mujahidin ke istemaal kiye gaye bam jaise the
 But after 2008, IM started using technologically advanced bombs
 in bamon ke aadhaar par agenciyon ko iem ke madul par buddhagaya ke dhamaakon ko anjaam dene kaa shaq he
 The slip found with the bomb, on which the location to plant the bomb was written, indicates that in this case the main module had given the task of planting the bomb to a local module
 lekin bam ko itani subah plant karne kaa makasad jaanch agenciyon ko hairaan kar rahaa he, kyonki amuman is vakt tak mandir main kaaphi bheedbhad nahin hoti he
 However, according to the information, two days before the blasts, a minister from Myanmar visited the temple
 agenciyon ke mutabik yaa to aatankwaadi group mantri ko nishaanaa bananaa chahta tha yaa uski timming galat ho gai
 It is also possible that the blasts were done only for the purpose of giving a signal

 aap is baat ko lekar aashwast rahen ki lakhon bhartiya aapke kaam kii vajah se khudako garvanvit mahasoos karte hai

 Dear Mr Banerjee, These bigots are blinded by hatred and have no idea what a professional is
 You cannot explain it to them, even if you tried for a decade
 Please be certain that millions of Indians are proud of your work
