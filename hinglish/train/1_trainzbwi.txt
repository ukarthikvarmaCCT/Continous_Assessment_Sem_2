 har din apane rashtriya adhyaksh lalu yadav or unke parivaar dwaara arjeet sampati ke khulaase se tang aakar rashtriya janata dal ne bijepi se kaha he ki vah puure maamle kii jaanch pravartan nideshaalay se kara le
 On Saturday, senior BJP leader Sushil Modi released papers among media persons to gift a three-storey house to Lalu Yadav's sons by former Rashtriya Janata Dal parliamentarian Kanti Singh
 modi kaa aarope he ki ye jameen janvari 2005 main bhent swaroop di gai or agle maheene vidhansabha chunaav main kanti singh ke pati keshav singh (ab swargeey) ko pero se tikat diya gaya or wo chunaav haar gaye
 However, Kanti Singh had done this medicine in front of the media on Friday that whatever gift or land he had given on lease, he had voluntarily given it
 lekin modi ke aaropon ke anusaar lalu yadav ne pehali baar 1996 main jab unhen kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil karaayaa yaa 2005 main, mahange makaan kaa gift lene ke baad hi tikat diya yaa phir kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil karavaaya
 Kanti Singh has been a union minister in both Deve Gowda and Manmohan Singh's cabinet
 haalanki susheel modi ke sanvadata sammelan ke turant baad rashtriya janata dal ke pravaktaa manoj jha ne pratikriya dete hue kaha ki ye khulaase kaa khulaasa he or ye saare kagajaat saarvajanik hai
 Challenging Modi, Manoj Jha said that he has a government at the Center, then why are he delaying in investigating the Enforcement Directorate
 manoj jha ne modi ke sambandhiyon dwaara kiye gaye kathith ghotaale ko harshad mehta ghotaale kii yaad dilaane vaala bataaya
 The comments rashtriya janata dal kii taraf se purv saansad shivanand tiwari bhi media waalon se rubaru hue or kaha ki bhale 2008 main unhone lalan singh jo ki ab nitish mantrimandal main cabinet mantri hai, ke saath lalu yadav ke sampati kaa maamla uthaaya ho, lekin ab ise uthaane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 At the same time, Modi read an old statement of Tiwari in front of the media that if Lalu Yadav had the reins of the country in his hands then he could sell the country too
 is bich modi ne puure sampati vivaad ke saarvajanik hone se rajd kii badhati mushkilon ke maddenjar shanivaar ko ghoshnaa kar di ki agle ek maheene ke dauraan ye sampati ke khulaase par sanvadata sammelan jari rakhenge
 The leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal also believe that there are about two dozen leaders who have done this work in the last 20 years in lieu of becoming a ticket or a minister, as far as writing property or giving a mark or land in the gift is concerned
 lekin rajd ke netaa filhal ye maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin ki har din hone vaale is khulaase se filhal koi rajnatik nuksaan hoga
 But the BJP claims that Lalu Yadav may give an argument on this issue, but these revelations can certainly make it difficult for the leader of the grand alliance, Nitish Kumar, who is demanding action across the country on the issue of benami property
 kanti singh devegoda or manmohan singh donon ke mantrimandal main kendriya mantri rahi hai
 However, soon after Sushil Modi's communicators' conference, Rashtriya Janata Dal spokesperson Manoj Jha said that these revelations are disclosed and all these papers are public
 modi ko manoj jha ne chunauti dete hue kaha ki centre main unki sarkaar he, tab pravartan nideshaalay se jaanch karne main der kyon kar rahe hai
 Manoj Jha termed the alleged scam by Modi's relatives as a reminder of the Harshad Mehta scam
 tippaniyan On behalf of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, former MP Shivanand Tiwari also met with media persons and said that even though in 2008 he raised the issue of Lalu Yadav's property with Lalan Singh, who is now a cabinet minister in Nitish's cabinet, but now raising it Has no justification
 vahiin modi ne tiwari ke ek puraane bayaan ko media waalon ke saamne pard kar suna diya ki agar lalu yadav ke haath main desh kii bagdor ho tab wo desh ko bhi bech sakate hai
 In the meantime, Modi announced on Saturday that in view of the growing problems of the RJD with the entire property dispute going public, they will continue the conference on the disclosure of the property during the next one month
 rashtriya janata dal ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki jahaan tak sampati likhavane yaa gift main maakan yaa jameen lene kaa prashn he, aise kareeb do darjan netaa hai jinhone pichley 20 varshon ke dauraan tikat yaa mantri banane ke badale ye kaam kiya
 But RJD leaders are not ready to believe that every day the revelations will cause any political damage
 lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki lalu yadav bhale is mudde par koi tark de den, lekin benami sampati ke mudde par puure desh main karwaai kii maang karne vaale mahagathbandhan ke netaa nitish kumaar ke liye ye khulaase nishchit rup se mushkil badha sakate hai

 kai baar mote log apni persenality ko lekar kaaphi chintit rahete hai
 They feel that there is nothing in the fashion market that can suit their personality
 patale logon se khud kii tulana kar vah man hi man pareshaan hote rahete hai
 But do you know that if you change your dress a little, then this problem can be overcome
 yani mote hone ke baavjood aapaki persenality nikhar ke saamne aa sakati he
 Fat and tall people should buy clothes after seeing their body size
 genes, tii-shart, trouger, shart, shorts aadi ko sahi tareeke se chunanaa sikh len
 Also, it is necessary to buy clothes keeping in mind the color
 aise khariden shart or tii-shartmotopa chhipaane ke liye aksar log looj kapade pahananaa pasand karte hai
 Despite this, they do not hide it
 aise main chote prints or vertical strip dizin vaale shart pahanen
 Choose T-shirt long size and loose fit
 collection main kurte aise hon jo ghutane tak aaen
 Do not forget to carry layering
 If you wear a denim jacket with a t-shirt, it will be best
 haalanki garmi ke mausam ko dekhte hue shart bhi pahan sakate hai
 This will make you look cool and smart
 isamen aapkaa pet bhi zyada najar nahin aayega
 How to get jeans collection In this situation, one should be most careful while buying jeans
 mote logon ko regular feet or boot cat genes pahanani chahie
 If you wear more open clothes in lower, you will look thicker
 genes kharidte samay keval sahi sies hi nahin balki color bhi bahut myne rakhata he
 Try to make the jeans dark colored
 hatya ke do aaropee nausainikon ko bharat naa bhejne ke italy ke kadam par bharat ne gahari naaraazgi jataai he
 The Indian Foreign Ministry summoned the Italian ambassador and demanded the return of the two accused
 gauratlab he ki italvi rajdoot ke halafname ke aadhaar par hi supreme court ne nausainikon ne italy jane kii ijaajat di thi
 India on Tuesday rejected the stand of the Italian government, promising to return two Italian marines, so that a case of murder could be brought against them in the country itself
 videsh sachiv ranjan mathai ne kaha, ‘maine italvi rajdoot ko apane daftar main talab kiya
 Basically, what i told them is that we are not acceptable to the note given to us regarding the stand of the Italian government in relation to the two marines
 'mathai ne kaha ki italviyon kii taraf se chah march ke note main baatcheet kii peshkash kii gai thi jo ucchtam nyaayalay ko die gaye aashwaasan se alag he
 The Italian ambassador has been summoned a day after the Italian Foreign Ministry's refusal to return two marines
 italvi videsh mantralay ne aarope lagaaya he ki bhartiya adhikariyon ne marine ko hiraasat main le kar antarrashtriya adhikaron kaa ulanghan kiya he
 The Italian Foreign Ministry had said that its stand on the question of letting an international arbitrator assess the case was open
 italvi marine, masimilano latore or salvator jirone par pichley saal farvari main jal dasyu nirodhi karrwai main kerala tat ke nikat do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya kaa aarope he
 He was allowed to travel to Italy for four weeks on 22 February to vote in the election by the Supreme Court
 isse pehle unhen christmas kii chhuttiyon main ghar jane kii ijaajat di gai thi
 He returned to India at the end of the holiday
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki kal ‘note varbal’ main italy ne suchit kiya tha ki ‘chunki do deshon ke bich vivaad sthapit hua he, pradaan kii gai anumati ke samaapt hone par do italvi marine, latore or jirone bharat nahin lautenge
 "the Ministry of External Affairs said," the Indian government strongly states that it does not agree with the stand expressed by the Italian government on the return of the two marines
 ' ‘unhen (italvi rajudat ko) bataaya gaya ki bharat italy ganraajya se apeksha karata he ki ek desh ke naate vah bharat ke ucchtam nyaayalay ko die gaye samprabhu aashwaasan ko puraa karne ke liye kanoon ke shashan ke prati vachanabaddh he
 Only after this assurance did the Supreme Court allow the two marines to travel and stay in Italy for a period of four weeks and return to India under the supervision, supervision and control of the Italian Republic, the Foreign Ministry said
 ' mantralay kii ore se italvi rajdoot ko suchit kiya gaya ki italy sarkaar ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh kii sharton ke anusaar anubandhit kaal ke andar bharat main unki vaapasi sunishchit karne ke liye vachanabaddh he
 Asked about the Italian ambassador's response to this, Mathai said he noted this stance and said he would inform his government of this
 is bich, salisitor general mohan parasaran ne is par afsos jataayaa ki italy sarkaar ucchtam nyaayalay ko die gaye aashwaasan se mukar rahi he
 Parasaran said, 'it is sad that the rule of law is being violated at the highest level of the court
 unhone kaha ki chaahe koi kitna bhi bada or shaktishaalee ho, ucchtam nyaayalay ke adhikarashetra main pesh karne ke baad vah uskaa ulanghan nahin kar saktaa
 The Government of Italy must abide by the assurance given to the Supreme Court
 udhar, tiruvanantpuram se mili ek report ke anusaar marxvaadi communist party kii kerala ikai ne aarope lagaaya ki kendra or rajya sarkaron ne italvi marine ko bachaane ke liye ‘anuchit khel’ khelaa he
 In a statement issued from the CPI (M) State Secretariat, it was alleged, 'prime Minister Manmohan Singh and (kerala) Chief Minister Oommen Chandy are now expressing their innocence
 shuruyaat se hi kendra ore rajya sarkaar yahaan marine ko sajaa dilaane ke prayaas main eemaandaar nahin thi

 In Jehanabad, Bihar, a woman sacrificed social evils
 darasal, mahila ke pati nedehejamein motorcycle nahin milane kii vajah se uski hatya kar di
 The incident is from malichak-soharaya village of Paras Bigha police station area of jehanabad
 yahaan aapraadhik chhavi ke pati ne apni patni keechaakugodane ke baad eent pattharon se petakar hatya kar di
 According to the information, the doll of 25 years was married to a young man named Rakesh 3 years ago
 rakesh lagaataar apni patni or sasuraal waalon par dahej ke liye dabaav banaata rahata tha
 It is being told that Rakesh demanded a motorcycle in dowry, but used to persistently torture his wife
 shuukravaar kii raatrakeshor gudiya ke bich jamkar jhagada hua jiske baad aavesh main aakar rakesh ne badi berahami se chaaku se godakar or eent-pattharon se petakar gudiya kii hatya kar di
 When the villagers came to know about this ruthless killing the next morning, they informed the police
 police maukey par pahunch kar turant gudiya keshavako apane kabje main le liya or postmortem ke liye sadar aspataal bhej diya
 At the same time, the family of the woman has also alleged that she was murdered for dowry
 police ne philhal puure maamle ko lekar praathmiki darj kar lee he or aaropee pati kii talash kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, his entire family including Rakesh are absconding since the incident
 bharat ke chunaav ayukta opi ravat dwaara raajnneetik partiyon ke bare main chunaav jeetne ke taur-tareeke ko lekar kii gai tippanee ko lekar raajnneetik partiyon kii ore se tikhi pratikriya ai he
 Rawat had said at a function that the situation in the country has become such that parties want to win elections by doing anything at any cost, which is a matter of concern
 unhone kaha tha ki loktantr ko phalne-phoolne ke liye jaruri he ki chunaav saaf-suthere tareeke se or paardarshee hon, lekin aaj jo halaat paidaa ho gaye hai, use dekhakar aisa lagata he ki chunaav main jeet hi sab kuch ho gai he
 The Election Commissioner's comment on this issue is considered to be very important because about 10 days ago, there were allegations of horse-trading and pressure on the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat
 congress party kii shikaayat par chunaav ayog ne congress ke do vidhayakon kaa vot bhi radd kar diya tha
 When asked about this statement of the Election Commission, Janata Dal United leader Sharad Yadav, he said that he fully agreed with what the Election Commissioner said, but the Election Commission should not weigh every party on the same scale 
 iske alaavakendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvine bhi ravat kii tippanee par tikhi pratikriya di thi
 Sharad Yadav said that the Election Commission should have disclosed the names of the parties which are getting the most money
 sabhi partiyon ko isamen nahin ghasite
 He said that he has been the president of JDU and as such he can say that there are very small parties, which can barely contest the elections
 isaki vajah yah he ki raajnneeti main puri tarah se dhanabal haaavee ho chukaa he
 The special thing is that after the Janata Dal split from Nitish Kumar in United, Sharad Yadav and his supporters are in a mood to knock the door of the Election Commission to get the party's election symbol
 shanivaar ko patna main ek taraf nitish kumaar ne jediu kii baithak bulaai he, jisamen endie main jane kaa aupchaarik elaan kiya jayega, to duusari taraf patna main hi sharad yadav ne bhi apane samarthakon kii baithak bulaai he
 On Friday, Sharad Yadav's supporter and Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar said that Sharad Yadav would tell his supporters how it was wrong to go with the BJP? Ali Anwar said that if needed, jdu's election symbol to get arrow For this, they can also knock the door of the Election Commission
 sharad yadav ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki jediu ke sansthaapak adhyaksh sharad yadav hi the or nitish kumaar ne baad main apni samta party kaa usamen vilay karaayaa tha
 That is why the real JDU is the one that has Sharad Yadav
 lekin sharad yadav or unke samarthakon ke tamaam daavon ke baad sachai yah he ki jediu ke zyaadaatar netaa or kaaryakarta nitish kumaar ke saath dikhte hai
 Angered by the decision to go with the BJP, when Sharad Yadav took out his yatra in Bihar, none of the jdu's 71 mlas from Bihar came with him

" main isaki adhik parvaah nahin karti hum
 "comments richa ne kaha ki aisa vahi log karte hai jinke paas koi or kaam nahin he
 He said, "look, the condition of the economy is bad
 bahut saare logon ke paas naukari nahin he
 Therefore many people are recruited to troll others
 aise log internet par logon par tippaniyan kar apana kaam chalaate hai
 If you have been assigned this job due to unemployment, then best of luck to you but, this job is not going to last long
 " richa ne aage kaha, "yah sabit ho gaya he ki logon ko gaaliyaan dene ke liye ek puri trol mashinari kaam karti he

 Richa said, "I want to tell you that it is a big compliment for me that people recognize me when i go on the road
 yah isliye nahin he ki main bahut prasiddh hum
 It is only because of my image that i change my physical expressions

 The rest of Europe was also lagging behind

 In the midst of such a global environment, while many economists are saying that the global economy will undergo a repeat of the 2008 Great Depression, India stands as a ray of hope, with an estimated 7 percent GDP growth rate for 2015-16

 Obviously, Jaitley was the star of global leaders at the Davos conference
 lekin bharat lautakar is maah ke ant main jetali jab apana teesraa bajet pesh karne kii taiyaariyon main jute hue hai to unki raaton kii neend haraam he
 He told India Today in a conversation, "when you go to international forums, everyone calls you a bright star because the performance of others does not look better than you

 Corporate revenue growth has stagnated
 korporate karj ucchtam str par he or achche dinon main tamaam companiyon ko jo karj mila tha, use chukaane main unke paseene chhot rahe hai
 The reality is that the atmosphere in the corporate world is the worst at this time and the stock market, which had sprung up after Modi's arrival, is now eating dives
 is dauraan do saal lagaataar kharaab monsoon ke chalate krishi kshetra main vruddhi puri tarah thahar chuki he
 The pace of rural income is slowing down in this decade

 Jayant Sinha, Minister of State for Finance, says, "in the economy we are struggling with two issues - one is excess, excess capacity and stalled projects done in the past as well as the fact that there is a slowdown in commodities all over the world
" yah dohari samasya he jisane arthvyavastha ke kuch kshetron main vaastavik chunautiyaan paidaa kii hai
 "this problem is further compounded by production and investment of new projects that have not improved despite Jaitley's maximum efforts and which have had no impact on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much talked about program" Make in India "
 pratyaksh kar sangrah shaayad apane lakshyon se chook jayega
 Apart from this, the finance minister will not be able to meet the disinvestment targets due to the slowdown in the stock market
 sarkaar ab tak vinievesh se bajet main prastaavit 69,500 karod kii raashi kaa aadha bhi nahin juta saki he
 They also cannot expect the services sector to accelerate the economy due to the global economic slowdown, as it did in the nineties and early 2000s

 sarkaar ne chaar saal kii avadhi main bainkon ke punarpunjikaran ke liye 70,000 karod ke package kaa elaan kiya he jo sarkari rajasav par ek or boj he

 In view of all these problems, Jaitley, his subordinate Jayant Sinha and Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subrahmanyam have already made their projections of growth flexible
 duniya main bhale hi bharat kii 7
 The projected annual economic growth of 5 per cent may be staggering, but Jaitley knows that his declared estimate of 8 at the beginning of the year
 1-8
 This is much less than the 5 percent growth rate
 is baat kii ummid kam dikhti he ki arthvyavastha 2016-17 main 9 fisadi kii raftaar se aage bad paaegi, jaisaa unhone 2015 ke aarambh main ummid jataai thi
 Not only this, the Finance Minister is also aware that 7
 5 fisadi kaa aankada darasal pichley saal bharat kii jidipi kii gananaa ke tareeke main kiye gaye badlaav se paidaa hua he
 If old methods are still adopted, most economists believe that the actual growth rate is 5 to 5
 5 fisadi ke bich baithegi bilkul utana hi jitna upie ke aakhri varshon main darj kii gai thi
 Another big problem facing Jaitley is that he has to not only assure that the growth will accelerate but also to see that this growth is such that it can generate employment
 har maheene kareeb das lakh yuva rojgaar ke bazaar main pravesh kar rahe hai or modi sarkaar kaa ek bada sirdard yah he ki kaaphi teji se rojgaar paidaa ho saken taaki badhati bheed ko kaam mil sake

 An economist from Mumbai says, "this is worrying
 logon ne nau maheene tak intjaar kiya ki jameen par kuch harakat ho, apni kshamta ko atirikt nirmit kiya or phir unhen yah ehsaas hua ki ab or logon ko rojgaar dene kii jarurat nahin he
 The real issue is to focus on employment-intensive industries

 By the end of the year it was selling at a rate of 30 to 35 dollars a barrel

 Among the other measures in Jaitley's quiver, there are schemes to promote smes, the government's math is that they will create a lot of jobs, especially at lower levels
 or ek zyada spasht kar vyavastha jo videshi niveshkon ko bharat main epadi laate rahane main or gharelu udyog ko taqatvar banane main madad karegi
 These logical steps are seen on the paper and no one can extract them
 magar asaliyat main ye kuch zyada hi mushkil sabit ho sakate hai
 Will Jaitley be able to do the things that he needs to do without having to fight through the many obstacles that come his way? His government will be judged by the budget he presents, and from this budget he will probably be remembered the most

 The Congress on Tuesday expelled six of its legislators, including an MLA from Amethi, for cross-voting against party candidate Kapil Sibal in the Rajya Sabha election in Uttar Pradesh last week

 On this occasion, General Secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Azad said that three of the six mlas expelled voted in favor of the BJP

 mumbai airport par hawaii jahaaj ke aage raashtrapati ke kafile kaa ek helicopter aane kii ghatana par dijisie ne apni report saunp di he
 The DGCA said in its report that the Indian Air Force helicopter arrived at the airport without permission
 unhen yah samajhnaa chahie tha ki mumbai airport asia mahadweep ke vyastatam airport main se ek he
 The DGCA has stated that there was no coordination among the three helicopters of the convoy
 nateeja yah hua ki pehla helicopter tay samay se pehle hi utar gaya
 The DGCA in its report blamed the convoy's first helicopter as it did not have co-ordination with the rest of the convoy
 dijisie kii report ne sabase badi galati bataai he ki helicopter di gai frequency main nahin tha
 Because of this, the helicopter could not be communicated with and due to this, the helicopter landed ahead of time
 control room ne ranve ko khaali dekha tha isliye usne indian airlines ko techoff karne kii ijaajat de di
 Before taking off, any ship has two types of speed
 agar wo duusare daur kii speed main ja chukaa he to jahaaj ko rokna naammumkin hota he
 On seeing the helicopter, the control room suddenly could not find that the President was from the convoy
 baad main kuch sanbhal kar usne payalat ko rukne kaa aadesh diya
 The pilot saw nothing on the runway and he also understood that the order was for the rear aircraft
 report main aakhri sawaal yahi uthaaya gaya he ki agar vimaan kii raftaar duusare daur main pahunch jaati to phir se rokna asambhav tha
 The DGCA has also recommended that all major cities should have separate corridors for helicopters
 vimaan mantralay ne is sifarish ko manjuuri de di he

 EVM ko lekar congress or aam aadmi party ne ek baar phir sawaal uthaaya he
 Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that there are constant complaints about EVM disturbances
 EVM ko lekar jahaan bhi gadabadi ke maamle saamne aate he, vahaan bijepi ko hi vot kyon jaataa he? is shankaa ko dur karne ke liye supreme court ke maujuuda jajon yaa phir ritaryad jajon kii ek samiti banaai jaae
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that VVPAT is not enough for evms
 madhya pradesh se lekar kai sthanon par EVM kii gadabadi kii baat saamne ai he
 If you look at all these places, then whoever presses the button is seen going to the bjp's account
 aisa kyon he ki jahaan bhi EVM kii gadabadi kii shikaayatein aa rahi hai, vahaan vot bijepi ko hi jaataa he
 Singhvi said that the foundation of democracy rests on elections
 aise main EVM kii shankaaon ko dur karne ke liye supreme court ke maujuuda jajon yaa phir ritred jajon kii ek samiti banaai jaae, taaki logon kaa bharosa loktantr par kaayam rahe
 UP civic elections should be done through ballot paper rather than EVM: Opposition and Aam Aadmi Party showed video of BJP tampering votes in EVM
 aap ne ab tak un sari EVM mashiinon kaa zikr kiya jin main gadabadiyon kii shikaayat ai he
 The Aam Aadmi Party said that in EVM press the button for any party, the vote is going to BJP
 aisa kaise ho rahaa he ki sidhe vot camel par ja rahaa he, kabhi galati se bhi vot jhaadu par kyon nahin jaataa he?aap party ne maang kii he ki upi kenagar nikaay chunaav EVM ke bajaae ballat paperse karaae jaae
 The Aam Aadmi Party said that EVM is being tampered with, it is a constitutional issue
 iske liye ek saghan jaanch kii jaae or chunaav ayog isaki jaanch kare
 The AAP said that by issuing a white paper, what should the Election Commission be doing in this matter, so that the public's trust in the EVM can be maintained
 aap ne kaha ki dhaulpur kii 18 EVM mashiinon main hua or madhya pradesh ke bhind main to VVPAT mashin lagi hone ke baad bhi vot bijepi ke paksh main ja rahaa he
 Let us know that during the first phase of the municipal elections of UP on Thursday, a complaint of evm's mess has come up in Kanpur and Meerut
 votaron kaa aarope tha ki iviem main kisi bhi party kaa batan dabaane par vot bijepi ko ja rahaa he
 Supreme court has seized accounts amrapali ke adhure project ke maamle main uske teen diarectaron anil sharma, shivapriya or ajay kumaar ko police castady main bheja gaya he
 The Supreme Court called the police for this
 court ne kaha ki jab tak saare dastauez auditors ko uplabdh nahin karaate tab tak police hiraasat main rahenge
 The comments supreme court ne builder ko lagaai fatkaar or kaha ki supreme court ke saath ‘hide and sik’ na khelen supreme court ne amrapali builder ko forensik audit karne ke liye dastavej dene ke liye kaha tha
 But the Supreme Court resented the non-compliance of the order
 supreme court ne kaha ki kyon na aapke ke khilaaf court kii avmaananaa kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae
 The Supreme Court said to Amrapali, the builder is not intentionally following orders
 ye puri tarah court kii garima ke saath khilwaad he
 The Supreme Court reprimanded the builder and said not to play 'hyde and Seek' with the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court had asked the Amrapali builder to provide documents to conduct a forensic audit
 lekin aadesh kaa paalan na karne par supreme court ne naaraazgi jataai 
 Supreme Court said why not prosecute the court against you
 amrapali se supreme court ne kaha, builder jaanboojhkar adeshon kaa paalan nahin kar rahaa he
 It is playing with the dignity of the court
 amrapali se supreme court ne kaha, builder jaanboojhkar adeshon kaa paalan nahin kar rahaa he
 It is playing with the dignity of the court
 loktantr main nirvachan kii prakriya mahatvapurn he
 Not nomination
 is lihaaz se rahul gandhi or amit shah donon hi manonayan se adhyaksh bane hai
 Not by election
 yani koi chunaav nahin hua he
 Of course Rahul Gandhi comes from family but it is not that Amit Shah has become the president from the elections
 ve parivaar kii jagah kisi kii khaas pasand ke kaaran banate hai
 i call it Yarvad
 parivaarwaad or yaaravaad main antar ho saktaa he magar donon ke adhyaksh banane kii prakriya main koi antar nahin he
 Both are nominated
 nirvaachit nahin
 Amit Shah, who differentiates himself from Rahul Gandhi as the president, should tell that against whom did he become president after contesting elections? Can he continue in the post of president even for a minute without the likes of Sangh and Modi
 bharat ke kisi bhi dal main aantarik loktantr nahin he
 In principle, no one should have difficulty accepting it
 aantarik loktantr kaa matlab chayan kii prakriya se he
 There is no election in any party
 is aadhaar par bharat ke sabhi dalon ne niraash kiya he, agar unke samarthakon ko in baton se niraashaa hoti he to
 Rahul Gandhi attempted to conduct elections in the Youth Congress and KJ Rao had appointed the former election officer as the Election Commissioner
 kai netaa us chunaav kii prakriya se chune gaye or baad main rahul gandhi ne yah prayog chhod diya
 Modi and Amit Shah can tell if both of them have done such experiment or not
 congress main sonia gandhi ko adhyaksh banane ke liye chunaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 That election had become serious
 jitendra prasad ne sonia gandhi ko chunauti di thi
 Jitendra Prasad lost but was not removed from the Congress
 jitendra prasad congress main hi rahe or unki patni saansad chunaav ladi
 His son became an MP from Shahjahanpur and also became a minister
 magar sonia gandhi ko chunauti dene vaale jitin prasad kaa bhi ek parivaar ban gaya
 Rajesh Pilot also contested the post of President
 unke nidhan ke baad patni saansad baniin or bete sachin payalat is vakt up mukhyamantri hai
 There is also a family of challengers to the Gandhi family
 congress main parivaarwaad zyaada he magar kisi or dal main kam he aisa nahin he
 Jayant Sinha is currently a dynasty in the Bharatiya Janata Party
 nirmala sitaraman ke sasur congress kii sarkaar main mantri rahe hai
 Pati contested on Congress ticket twice
 ek baar bhaajapa se chunaav lade
 All three were defeated

 Sandeep's father is an MP
 kalyaan singh rajasthan ke rajyapal hai
 Kailash Vijayvargiya got his son a ticket in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections
 ve vidhayak ban gaye hai
 Many such examples can be given from BJP
 har dal se die ja sakate hai
 bjp's ally Akali Dal, Lok Janshakti Party, Shiv Sena also have familism
 vahaan bhi thakare kii jagah thakare adhyaksh hue hai or badal kii jagah badal or paswan kii jagah paswan
 Biju Janata Dal has the same condition
 bijepi ne mahabuuba mufti ko mukhyamantri banaaya
 Mehbooba also comes from the quota of familism
 apana dal main koi or adhyaksh nahin banegaa
 Only Anupriya Patel will be formed
 is tarah ke udhaaharan or die ja sakate hai
 RJD, Trinamool, National Conference, SP
 inamen se kisi bhi dal main aantarik loktantr nahin he yani adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav nahin hota he
 Can Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah take the line that they will end the dynasty of their party and will not have any alliance with the dynastic party? Is the issue of familism just for Rahul and Priyanka for both? Can they appeal to the people to abolish familism by taking the same name as Gandhi, Paswan, Thackeray, Yadav, Patel, Badal, Naidu? The politics of both will end
 pradhanmantri modi ko prachand bahumat mila
 He did nothing to bring transparency in politics
 ulta kanoon paas karvaa diya ki koun chanda degaa ab koi nahin jaan sakegaa
 50 percent of the donations received by all political parties come from unknown sources
 kya ye donon wheep system khatm kar sakate hai? kyon loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha main vot ke samay wheep jari hota he, kisi saansad ko apane vivek ke aadhaar par khilaaf vot karne kaa adhikaar kyon nahin he? isliye in donon kii dilchaspee na to aantarik loktantr laane main he or na hi paardarshita laane main
 Only in giving speeches
 rahul gandhi bhi aisa nahin karenge or na arvind kejariwal
 At present, there are only three parties left from familyism
 jad you, sipiem or aam aadmi party
 You can also put BSP in this category
 kanshiram ke baad mayawati adhyaksh bani thim
 She was not of any kind
 kanshiram tamaam udaahranon main sabase pavitra hai
 Kept his family away from politics
 ungali uthaakar kisi ko vidhayak bana dene vaale kanshiram ne apane parivaar ke logon ko vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa nahin bheja
 But Mayawati will remain the president while Mayawati remains
 basapa kii yah visheshta sankuchit ho chuki he
 Should an ordinary worker and citizen be concerned about familyism? Must be absolutely
 agar raajnneeti pariwaron ke hawaale hoti jaaegi to isamen nai pratibha kaa janm nahin hoga
 Politics will be held hostage
 jo ki ho chuki he
 There is a need for honesty and seriousness about this question
 parivaarwaad hi nahin, paisawad bhi chunauti he
 If you do not have money, you will not be able to reach the top
 neuyark uniwarsity ke professor ne ek kitaab likhi he
 In his research, it is stated that in 2004,2009, 2014, about 20 to 30 mps of Lok Sabha had a background
 ganimat he ki loksabhaa ke str par yah beemaari abhi faili nahin he
 Still 80 percent of the mps are coming from non-family backgrounds
 ek naagarik or kaaryakarta ke rup main satark rahanaa chahie ki raajnneeti chand pariwaron ke haath main na rah jaae
 But neither Amit Shah, nor Narendra Modi nor Rahul Gandhi are qualified to debate this question
 sirf janata isaki yogyata rakhti he jiskaa koi parivaar nahin hota he
 Unless these leaders take a clean line, do not listen to their nonsense in the name of familism
 tivi band kar den
 Is the public worried about familism, yarism and moneyism? Only the public can tell

 hindu manyataon ke anusaar, pindadaan moksh prapti kaa ek sahaj or saral maarg he
 Though Pinddaan is done in many places of the country, but Pinddaan is very important in Gaya, situated on the Falgu coast of Bihar
 kaha jaataa he ki bhagwaan ram or devi sita ne bhi raja dasharath kii aatma kii shanti ke liye gaya main hi pindadaan kiya tha
 The blessings of the fathers are obtained from the service of the cow, for the blessing of Gaya, in the Mahatma Mahabharata, it is written that a person who sees Lord Gadadhar (lord Vishnu) in Shraddhapaksha by bathing in the Phalgu Tirtha is freed from the debt of the ancestors
 kaha gaya he ki phalgu shraadh main pindadaan, tarpan or brahman bhojan-ye teen mukhya kaary hote hai
 The rituals and laws of ritual are different in Pitrupaksha
 shraddhalu ek din, teen din, saat din, pandrah din or 17 din kaa karmkand karte hai
 Gaya is considered the city of Vishnu
 yah moksh kii bhoomi kehalaati he
 It is also discussed in Vishnu Purana and Vayu Purana
 vishnu puraana ke mutabik, gaya main pindadaan karne se purvajon ko moksh mil jaataa he or ve swarg main vaas karte hai
 Vishnu himself is believed to be present as the ancestral deity here, hence it is also known as the 'pitru Tirtha'
 gaya ke panda devvrat ne bataaya ki phalgu nadi ke tat par pindadaan kiye bina pindadaan ho hi nahin saktaa
 The process of pindadan starts from the banks of the Punpun River
 jaane, pitrupaksh main kyon nahin karte shubh kaary or shaadi kii shoppingaye he kahanekinvadantiyon ke anusaar, bhasmasur ke vanshaj main gayasur naamak rakshas ne kathin tapasya kar brahma se vardaan maanga tha ki uskaa sharir devataaon kii tarah pavitra ho jaae or log uske darshan maatr se paap mukt ho jaaen
 He got this boon, but the bad effect was that the population of heaven started increasing and everything started to be contrary to the natural law, because people started sinning without fear and sin was freed from the philosophy of Gayaasur
 isse bachane ke liye devataaon ne yajna ke liye pavitra sthal kii maang gayasur se kii
 Gaiasur gave his body to the gods for the yajna
 daitya gayasur jab leta to uskaa sharir paanch kos main fail gaya
 This is what was said in place of five Kos
 gayasur ke man se magar logon ko paap mukt karne kii ichha nahin gai or usne devataaon se phir vardaan maanga ki yah sthaan logon ko taarane vaala bana rahe
 Whatever fathers offer here, their fathers should be liberated
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi log apane pitaron ko taarane yani pindadaan ke liye gaya aate hai
 According to the Pindavidvans, the spherical form of an object is called a body
 pratikatmak rup main sharir ko bhi pind kaha jaataa he
 The material to be offered to the deceased at the time of the pindadan, in which the spherulis made by kneading barley or rice flour is called pind dakshinabhimukh hokar, aachman kar apane janeu ko daaen kandhe par rakhkar chaaval, gaay ke doodh, ghi, shakkar evam shahad ko milakar bane pindon ko shraddha bhav ke saath apane pitaron ko arpit karnaa pindadaan kehalaata he
 Black sesame, barley, kusha and white flowers were mixed together in the water and they were offered in a ceremonial manner
 manyata he ki isse pitar trupt hote hai
 After this, the Brahmin is served food after the Shraddha
 pandon ke mutabik, shastron main pitaron kaa sthaan bahut ooncha bataaya gaya he
 The ancestral category includes all the ancestors including deceased mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, maternal grandfather, grandmother
 vyapak drushti se mrit guru or acharya bhi pitaron kii shrenee main aate hai
 360 Vedianca in Gaya It is said that Gaya had 360 altars of various names where pindadan was performed
 inamen se ab 48 hi bachi hai
 However many religious institutions are demanding the discovery of those old altars
 is samay inhen 48 vediyon par log pitaron kaa tarpan or pindadaan karte hai
 It is considered important to offer Vishnupad temple in the altars here, on the banks of river Phalgu and under the syllabus
 pindadaan kii vishesh jagahenullekhneey he ki desh main shraadh ke liye haridwar, gangasagar, jagannathpuri, kurukshetra, chitrakoot, pushkar, badrinaath sahit 55 sthanon ko mahatvapurn mana gaya he
 In the Shastras, three places are considered to be the most special for pindadan
 inamen badrinaath bhi he
 Badrinath has a tarpan law for the emancipation of Pitradosh in the Brahmakpal Siddha area
 haridwar main narayani shila ke paas log purvajon kaa pindadaan karte hai

 aaropon ke saamne aane ke baad vikaas ko is project se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Anu Malik, who along with Sona Mohapatra, was subjected to allegations by some female musicians, was expelled from a reality show
 farah khan ke bhai sajid khan par bhi kai actraces ne gambhir maansik torchar or yon utpeedan ke aarope lagaae jiske baad unase bhi housephul 4 ke diarection kii kaman chin lee gai thi

 vahi is maamle main actress tamanna bhaatia ne ye bhi kaha tha ki is movement ko kuch logon ne apni publicity kaa jariya bana liya
 It is clear that there is a lot of skepticism about this movement and a large section of Bollywood is visible with this movement but not actively
 khaas baat ye bhi he ki kisi bhi star ne naanaa patekar kii clin chit par yaa tanushri ke aaropon par koi khaas stand nahin liya he
 It is not that nothing has been gained from this movement
 ek report ke anusaar, dilli or mumbai jaise shaharon main rahane vaale purush ab mahilaon ke prati samvedansheeltaa main badhotaree dekhne ko mili he lekin ye paryaapt nahin he
 The Meetu movement has also been criticized for the fact that the movement was limited to only elite and upper class women who had the resources
 is movement ko samaaj ke us hisse main le jane kii koshishen asafal sabit huin jahaan ye samasya or zyada gambhir he
 Although some programs like Dignity March also tried to spread this movement to rural India, but this effort did not seem to be successful
 ye movement sirf madhyam vargeey or apper class mahilaon tak hi simit rah gaya or iske baavjood bhi ye movement safal hota nahin dikh rahaa he

 There is no doubt that Anurag has shown the greed of humans by making kidnapping of children in large numbers as an issue, but the way the story is woven is beyond the comprehension or choice of the general audience
 agar aapako anuraag kashyap kaa cinema pasand he, dark cinema dekhnaa acha lagata he, to aap ek baar dekh sakate hai

 kashmir ko lekar pichley hafton main china ne badi-badi naitik baaten kahin or sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main chintaa jataai
 Ironically, at the same time that China was trying to co-operate with Pakistan over Kashmir, it was trying to force Hong Kong to succumb to its supremacy through an extradition bill and in violation of an international agreement
 1984 ke chini-british ghoshnaptr ke antarrashtriya samjhaute par china or britain ne dastakhat kiye the
 Through this, Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed over to Beijing since 1997
 par iske saath ye chetavaniyaan bhi judi thim ki 'ek desh, do pranaaliyon' ke siddhant kaa paalan hoga or honkong kii poonjivadi vyavastha 50 saal yani 2047 tak kaayam rakhi jaaegi
 Now China is trying to take full possession of this port city 30 years ago
 par honkong bhi joardaar pratirodh kar rahaa he
 On August 10, on the streets of Hong Kong, the lyrics of a famous song from the music-oriented film Les Miserables were echoing, "do you hear the people sing?" Singing the Song of Angry Men? ”there were about two million people singing it
 barish bhi unhen diga nahin saki
 They were opposing the administration's proposal to bring an extradition bill, which would allow extradition of wanted people into China
 logon ko dar he ki yah vidheyak honkong ko china ke adhikaar kshetra main le aayega, jisase uski swaittata or naagarik adhikaar kamjor honge
 He also demanded the resignation of Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam
 pradarshnon ke baad 15 june ko lam ne elaan kiya ki vidheyak ko taal diya gaya he
 The people of Hong Kong are not willing to accept it as anything less than a complete withdrawal
 ve yah bhi maang kar rahe hai ki 12 june ke virodh-pradarshnon ko 'danga' kahana waapas len, giraftaar pradarshnakariyon ko bina shart reeha karen, police ke bartaav kii jaanch ke liye swatantra ayog banaaen or saarvbhaum matadhikaar den
 Hong Kong had similar views in 2014
 us vakt saarvbhaum matadhikaar kii maang par asar daalane vaale chunaav sudhaaron ke khilaaf 'chaataa andolan' hua tha
 He was crushed and the verdict could not be changed
 is saal bhi monsoon kaa mausam hone kii vajah se ek baar phir chaate logon ke pratirodh kaa pratik ban gaye hai
 At present, China is in awe
 propagenda kii ladaai kaa pehla daur vah haar chukaa he
 According to unconfirmed reports, more than 700 protesters have been arrested or detained
 par prashasan andolan ke kisi netaa kii shinaakht nahin kar paaya he
 The world is watching it eagerly, while China faces many challenges
 piples libration army honkong kii sarhad par taiyaar khadi he par abhi daakhil nahin hui he
 Beijing knows how it will take the world to send troops to Hong Kong when Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to visit New York in September to attend the United Nations General Assembly
 china apni belt and road pahal ke jariye khud ko antarrashtriya sahyog ke stambh ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kar rahaa he, jo is kadam se ulataa pad jayega
 October 1 is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
 tab tak kisi karrwai kii sambhaavna nahin he kyonki jashn kaa maahaul kahin kharaab na ho jaae

 aaj ke daur main agar koi biimaar hota he to fouran kah diya jaataa he ki tumhaara lifestil kharaab he, bas phir ham jute jate hai ise thik karne main
 After 2-3 days of hard work, we go back to the same pattern again
 darasal ham kuch aadaton ke itani aadi ho chuke hai ki vah hamaari sehat ke liye nuksaandaayak hai, ye hamen pataa nahin chalata
 The result of this comes in front of us as being sick
 kya aap jaanate hai aisi koun se aadaten he jo aapako nuksaan pahunchaa rahi hai, nahin, ai jaanate hai- Often people skip breakfast in a hurry of office
 lekin subah kaa naashtaa din kaa sabase mahatvapurn khaanaa hota he
 Try to eat healthy, keep taking snacks 5 to 6 times a day
 ek achche naashte main protein kaa hona anivaary hota he
 Most people are coffee lovers
 din main ek yaa 2 cap coffee lenaa nuksaandaayak nahin hota, lekin isamen kriim or flavored syrup aid karnaa or calories badhanaa he
 Avoid drinking too much coffee
 jitna ho sake adhik se adhik pani pien
 During our lunch break we often start eating fast at the last minute
 jis kaaran khaanaa sahi se hajam nahin hota or kabj jaisi samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Wearing the wrong shoes can also be harmful to your health
 ho saktaa he ki aap hill pahanakar ghanton chal sakate hon phir bhi aapke pairon main dard na hota ho
 Try wearing flats instead of heels
 raat ko sone se pehle akasar log brush karnaa bhul jate hai
 Due to which their teeth start to become yellow or smell from the mouth
 isliye khaane ke baad brush jarur karen
 Change your brush in 3 to 4 months
 kam neend lenaa aapako motaape kaa shikaar bana saktaa he
 People, especially young people and office goers, avoid sleeping longer on Wikand than on other days
 in dinon ladke body building eksrasij karnaa zyada pasand karte hai, jis kaaran vah cardio jaisi eksrasij karnaa awoid karte hai
 Try to include treadmill work, outdoor walking and running in your daily schedule as well

 This can cause a bladder infection
 ek hi kandhe par lambey samay tak laptop kaa bag taange rakhana aapako health se zudi pareshaaniyaan de saktaa he
 This can cause pain in your shoulder
 akasar log offis kii jaldbaaji main brakefast skip kar dete hai
 But breakfast in the morning is the most important meal of the day
 healdi khaane kii koshish karen, din main 5 se 6 baar snekes lete rahen
 It is essential to have protein in a good breakfast
 zyaadaatar log coffee lover hote hai
 Taking one or 2 cups of coffee a day is not harmful, but add cream and flavored syrup and increase calories
 adhik coffee pine se bachein
 Drink as much water as possible
 apane lunch brake ke dauraan ham akasar aakhri minute main teji se khaanaa khaane lagate hai
 Due to which food is not digested properly and problems like Kabbaj have to be faced
 galat shoej pahananaa bhi aapke swasthya ke liye hanikaarak sabit ho saktaa he
 Maybe you can walk for hours wearing heels, yet your feet do not hurt
 hells kii jagah flats pahanane kii koshish karen
 Often people forget to brush before going to sleep at night
 jisase unke daant pile hone lagate he yaa phir moonh se badboo aane lagati he
 Therefore, do brush after eating
 apane brush ko 3 se 4 maah main jarur badalen
 Getting less sleep can make you obese
 log visheshkar yuva or offis jane vaale log anya dinon kii tulana main vickend par lambey samay tak neend lene se bachate hai
 These days, boys prefer to do bodybuilding exercises, which is why they avoid exercising like cardio
 koshish karen ki aap treadmill work, aautdoor walking or running ko bhi apane daily shadeul main shaamil karen
 Not emptying the bladder for a long time can be harmful for you

 Keeping a laptop bag hanging on one shoulder for a long time can give you a lot of health problems
 isse aapke sholder main dard ho saktaa he

 Salman Khan’s first release in China - # bajrangibhaijaan - commences its innings with HEALTHY numbers
 
 
 Debuts at No 7 at China BO
 
 
 Fri $ 2
 24 million [₹ 14
 61 cr]


 The start can be considered IMPRESSIVE since there were 5 new films, besides # BB, debuting in Top 10 charts
 
 
 Besides multiple releases + holdover titles posing stiff opposition, one must also consider the fact that # bajrangibhaijaan arrives in China after 30 months of its release in India, unlike # Dangal and # secretsuperstar that were released a few months after their release in India
 vah english kaa exam de rahi thi ki tabhi oxigen kaa silendar kharaab ho gaya
 
 
 This is the story of Neha Mehendiratta, a victim of respiratory syndrome
 neha ne 12veen kii pariksha paas kar lee he
 She wants to become a police officer
 garmi shuru ho chuki thi, umas bhari garmi
 In a school in the capital Delhi, Neha was giving exams like the rest of the students
 12veen ke exam
 English paper
 sab kuch normal tha, sivaay ek silendar ke
 Actually, Neha was suffering from a severe respiratory disease for years
 vah khuli hawa main saans nahin le sakati
 He always has to breathe through the oxygen cylinder through a mask
 aadha ghanta biit chukaa tha
 Neha was running fast
 uski vajah thi sirf aadhe ghante kaa bachaa hona
 It was not that the board's rules had changed
 darasal, neha kii medical condishan itani hi thik thi ki vah ek ghante baithkar exam likh sake
 Not more than this
 phir sab thik galat hone laga
 There was a disturbance in the cylinder of oxygen, difficulty in breathing
 kamare main maujuud teacher, skool kii principal sab pareshaan
 Neha's father was the prince outside the school
 peshey se auto rickshaw driver
 The same cylinder was set in the room
 jaise hi unhen pataa chalaa, vah auto lekar ghar kii taraf gaye, waapas laute
 By then Neha's condition had started deteriorating
 magar usne pareshaani jaahir nahin kii or ancer likhti rahi
 Result came
 neha paas ho gai, 50 fisadi se bhi zyada number aae
 But he leads the exam in Will Power
 uske papa rajkumaar bhi, jinhone beti ke ilaaj or padhai ke liye apni sari jamaa puunji kharch kar di
 Neha wants to study more

 He has been undergoing treatment for five years
 sabase pehle lagaataar khaansee kii shikaayat hui
 Then it was told that there was a problem with the toss
 phir doctoron ne tibi hone kii baat kahi
 In the last, this syndrome related to breath was confirmed
 2011 aate-aate uski haalat bighad chuki thi
 Had to enroll in Emergency
 march 2012 main doctoron ne rajkumaar ko saaf kar diya ki unki beti sirf silendar se hi saans le sakati he, khuli hawa main nahin
 There is hardly any day that the prince can only carry a ride
 doctoron ke paas jo janaa hota he
 The father and daughter return home with hope from there
 rajkumaar phir auto uthaakar duusari shift karne chalaa jaataa he
 Neha sits at the window of the house and sits down
 baahar bachche dikhte hai
 His age, running, running, playing
 uskaa bhi man karata he badminton khilne kaa, par nahin khel sakati
 Oxygen cylinder which is attached
 phir dhime se uthati he or paas hi rakhe drawing board tak pahunchati he
 The color of restlessness engraves on the canvas
 rang bolte hai, neha nahin
 Actually, there is also difficulty in speaking
 isliye neha kam hi bolti he
 When spoken, said 'main or acha kar sakati thi
 There was an increase in breathing, so no paper could write in more than an hour
 par jid thi ki paper sabake saath baithkar hi dene hai
 That is what happened
 60 fisadi paper hi atampt kar pai
 i want to study more now
 mujhe pasand he padhanaa
 "that's all the prince says," May my daughter ever get a fair treatment
 tab use saans lene ke liye mashiinon kii jarurat na pade
 'neha and her father are even more helpful in this battle of prince
 rajkumaar ne apni jamaa puunji 38 hajaar rupee kharch kar beti ke liye oxigen mashin kharid lee
 Then an extra oxygen cylinder was needed
 tab ek padosi aage aae
 He gave his house a cylinder to the prince

 com / eipeenfnai— ANI (@ani)september 29, 2017 In view of the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is troubled by its popularity in rural areas
 bhaajapa ko ashanka he ki use loksabhaa chunaav main madhya or pashchim bharat main apni maujuuda siton main se aadhi siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 In this way, the party is starting Mission 123
 ye 123 wo loksabhaa siten hai jo prachand modi lahar ke baavjood bhaajapa 2014 main nahin jeet pai thi
 Most of these 123 seats are from rural India
 yah aankada tab or pareshaan karne vaala ban gaya jab rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bhaajapa apni sarkaar ganvaa baithi
 Obviously, rural Behali is considered responsible for this
 ab bhaajapa kii haar or congress kii jeet ke peeche kisaanon kii karj maafee ko ek bada factor mana ja rahaa he
 Apparently, in the wake of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Modi government is trying to help farmers
 sambhaavna he ki aane vaale bajet main sarkaar kam keemton par fasal bechney vaale kisaanon ko unke nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye ek tay rakam dene kii bhi skim kii ghoshnaa kare
 If sources are to be believed, the Modi government can prepare a plan for this scheme by meeting with different ministries soon to benefit the farmers
 medium turm stretiji ke tahat agar fasalon kii keemten nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) se neeche girti hai to kisaanon ko sabsidi dekar raahat dene kii baat bhi saamne ai he
 Along with this, the government is trying to make the achievements made in the last 54 months in agriculture accessible to the public from every platform
 krishi mantri radhamohan singh kehete hai, "modi sarkaar krishi kshetra ko viksit karne or kisaanon kii mali haalat main sudhaar karne ke liye anek prayaas kar rahi he
 Under this, work is going on in the mission mode on issues such as reduction in agricultural cost, fair price of produce, curb wastage of produce and alternative sources of income of farmers
 "mumbai main crop care federation ke 'kheti-kisaani ko laabhprad banane ke liye sarkaar, udyog jagat or kisaanon ke sanyukt prayaas kitne aavashyak' seminar main logon ko sambodhit karte hue radha mohan singh ne daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar ke prayaason se pichley 54 maheenon main krishi ke kshetra main abhootpurv pragati darj hui he
 According to the Agriculture Minister, foodgrain production is 284 as per the fourth advance estimate in the year 2017-18
 83 mi
 The average production for the year 2010-14 is 255 tonnes
 59 mi
 Was a ton
 unhone kaha ki dalhan ke ausat utpaadan main bhi 40 fisadi kii badhotari hui he
 And this time 25 production of pulses
 23 million ton sambhavit he
 Along with this, there has also been an increase in horticulture, fish production and milk production
 radhamohan singh kehete hai, neem coted uria, mrudaa swasthya card, maikenigeshan or pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana se sansadhano ke behatar upyog se krishi kii laagat main kami hui he
 The Agriculture Minister claims that the budget released for agriculture was almost double that of the previous government by Rs 2,11,694 crore
 kar diya gaya he
 While the government is patting itself on the name of the National Agricultural Market (E-NAM) scheme and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Bima Yojana, its actual figures tell a different story
 kisaanon kii aamadani doguni karne ke sarkaar ke lakshya ke bare main radhamohan singh kehete hai, ki kisaanon ko unki fasal kii laagat kaa kam se kam dedh guna daam dilaane kaa vaada puraa karne kii disha main vartmaan sarkaar kaa kharif 2018-19 kii notephid fasalon ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya ko laagat kaa dedh guna yaa usase zyada badhane ke nirnay ko manzuri dena ek or bahut bada aitihaasik faisla he
 The Agriculture Minister may be claiming that there has been a tremendous growth in agriculture in the last 54 months, but the frustration on the face of farmers across the country is telling a different story
 saath hi, bhaajapa ke gramin siton par vot kaa aadhaar chhijane kii bhi yahi vajah he
 In such an interim budget, the scope of making attractive promises for farmers increases considerably

 Kalburgi's fight against traditional religious fundamentalism is also being cited as a reason behind this murder
 lekin kuch kaa kahana he ki kalburgi ke matbhedon kaa is hatya se koi lenaa dena nahin ho saktaa
 This is because Kalburgi's statements on religious superstition took more than a year
 us vakt hindutv sanghathanon ne kalburgi ke khilaaf naaraazgi bhi jataai thi
 But Kalburgi, who belongs to the Lingayat society, has old differences with his own community

 Retired professor of Karnataka College, Dharwad, Dr
 Siddalinga Pattanshetty said in an interaction with NDTV, 'people used to throw stones at his house and make threats
 vah teen hafte tak ghar se baahar nahin nikle the
 It seemed as if he would not survive
 iske baad unke saathi unhen lingayat ke puja sthal main lekar gaye jahaan unase jabardastee maafee mangvayi gai
 ' haalanki kuch samay se lingayat samaaj par tippanee karne ke baad kalburgi ko spashtikaran bhi dena pad rahaa tha
 Sujata Srinivasaraju, who oversees Kannada Prabha, a magazine that publishes her articles, told NDTV, 'she gave written explanations sitting in my office
 jis tarah vah safai de rahe the, usase to yahi lag rahaa tha ki unhen aane vaale khatre kaa ehsaas ho gaya tha
 He also said that his life has been reduced by five years due to being surrounded by controversies for the last two-three years
 ' But some say that Kalburgi's differences have nothing to do with this murder
 aisa isliye kyonki dharmik andhvishwavaas par kalburgi ke bayanon ko kareeb ek saal se zyada ho gaya
 At that time Hindutva organizations had also expressed resentment against Kalburgi
 lekin lingayat samaaj se taalluk rakhane vaale kalburgi ke apane hi birdari se vaichirak matbhed to isse bhi puraane hai
 But there are some indications that it seems that Kalburgi did not stop speaking on religious fundamentalism till his last breath

 After this, his companions took him to the place of worship of Lingayat where he was forced to apologize

 Valentines Day, i have celebrated this day just once in my whole life, because my friends have not left for the second time
 ye kissa aaj se 8 saal pehle kaa he
 My name is Kulwant, then used to study in 10th class
 mere saath ek shilpa naam kii ladki bhi padhati thi jo meri pehle dost kam girl friend hone kaa feel detii thi
 The biggest thing was that she was the most beautiful girl in my class, because the whole class was her fan
 mere saath ke saare dost shilpa se baat karne kaa mauka talashte rahete the
 Earlier, i too used to take peace from seeing Shilpa from a distance, but due to my looks not being less than any hero, my friend got over her quickly
 lekin ye kahani zyada din tak hit nahin rahi jisaki vajah mere dost the
 It happened that on Valentine's Day, i was playing with friends in the school field when Shilpa called me and asked me to go along
 maine use bolaa ek ghante ke andar miltaa hum kyonki main nahin chahta tha ki mere dosto ko mere shilpa se milane kii bhanak bhi lage
 According to my planning, i shot the friends and left the field
 main chahakta hua apana haal e dil bataane shilpa ke saath baitha hi tha ki meraa ek dost restaurant main pahunch gaya
 Seeing him, i just felt that i should do it any time
 main yahaan bhi kaamyaab rahaa or jaise-taise wo ham donon se milakar burgers khaakar chalata bana
 i came in my full form and spoke all my heart to Shilpa
 bas uskaa jawaab aane hi vaala tha ki meraa doosraa dost jise field main chhodkar aayaa tha aa dhamka
 Not only this, he met me and after 15 minutes, he said that man, you have worn my shirt, send me home
 ye sunakar meraa khun khul gaya
 As soon as he left, he came to know that two friends came again and said, "oh man, you are here, i went to your house and you have not met there
" maine poocha kyon gaye the aisa kya kaam tha tumhen jo mere skool se aadhe ghante ke baad hi tumhe yaad a gaya to bolaa tuune jo pant do din pehle lee thi wo chahie pahanani thi
 i was looking at him staring that he said, "oh, you have worn the same pants, no one has to give it in the evening
" ye sunakar to shilpa kaa paara bhi saatven aasmaan par tha or jab tak main use koi bolta wo uthakar chali gai
 Those who just did not leave were my friends, till i came to know that the whole army of friends was standing outside the restaurant
 wo sab aa gaye or sara kaa sara khaanaa bhi chat kar gaye
 After this, i ran them all over the college and smacked them
 lekin jab duusare din shilpa mili to usne baat karnaa to dur dekha bhi nahin
 Today, when i think of this, i get a stomach ache laughing
 sabase khaas baat meri ishk kii film main villen banane vaale mere dost aaj bhi mere dost hai
