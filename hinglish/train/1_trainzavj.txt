 The awareness of the students of the law college is so much that they are agitating for the wrong right, there are no teachers to teach in the state colleges here, but no one knows
 hamaare noujvaan whatsap or fasebuk par biji hai
 They do not know what it means to ask for themselves, so when someone raises another question, many of them come to Facebook and start abusing why they are asking questions
 shaayad unka yah matlab hoga ki chupchaap jaise ham barbaad hue hai, vaise hi tum bhi barbaad hote rahe

 kiraaya nahin de sake hai to cameraa khaali karne kaa dabaav bana rahata he
 Despite being a lecturer in mathematics, he has not been able to become an income tax payer
 parivaar kaa saport na hota to chaar maheene bina selary kii zindagi bitaani mushkil ho jaati he
 Kanshiram Prajapati is married, also has a child

 The name of this college is Vivekananda Government College

 According to the report of Dainik Bhaskar, there are 30 colleges in Madhya Pradesh where there is not a single regular teacher
 kya bharat ke naujavaanon ke saath yah mazaaq nahin he
 Did the youth not allow this joke to happen to them? unhone kyon nahin poocha ki jis kalege main jate hai vahaan shikshak kyon nahin he
 If guest scholars are not exploited, then the colleges of Madhya Pradesh are not able to run as much as they are running
 unhen aadhi selary dekar rajya sarkaar ne shiksha kaa bajet kitna bachaaya hoga
 Do not be afraid that this condition is only in Madhya Pradesh, from Delhi University to Bihar UP Rajasthan is everywhere

 Without family support, it becomes difficult to spend four months without salary
 kanshiram prajapati kii shaadi ho chuki he, ek baccha bhi he
 You can gauge the financial status of a master who teaches mathematics to about 100 students from the first year to the third year

 One is compelled to teach Mathematics in the college for Rs
 12000

 You can only calculate what the result of Zindabad and Murdabad was

 10 april ko dilli main vot daalane ke baad kejariwal punjab main prachaar ke liye nikal jaaenge or 13 april tak punjab main party ke liye prachaar karenge
 After this, the party's plan 'A' and plan 'B' will start from April 14

 By the way, the most important and big contest at this time is that of Banaras, for which the party has decided to throw its full force

 Anyway, if you have to compete with Narendra Modi in Benaras, then you have to make a lot of emphasis

 Although ISIS has not yet made any demand for his release, he is not releasing them either
 inamen se kuch log basra main fanse hai, to kuch logon ko mosul main bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya he
 The pressure on the Modi government to bring back the hostages of Iraq to a safe house is increasing day by day, so RAW has prepared an action plan that if successful, all the Indians trapped in Iraq will return to India
 ro ke is plan main bhartiya vayusena ek ahm role nibhaayegi
 Air Force C-17 Globemaster and C130J Super Hercules aircraft have been prepared to evacuate people trapped in Iraq
 sutron ke mutabik, ye vimaan dilli se sate hindon airbase par tainaat khadey hai
 As soon as they get a signal to go to Iraq, they will immediately leave for Iraq
 aapako bataa den ki bhartiya vayusena ne in donon hi vimaanon si-17 globamaster or si 130 je super harculis kii khaasiyat ko dekhte hue inhen is kaam main lagane kaa faisla liya gaya he
 Actually both these aircraft can fly to Iraq without stopping anywhere
 si 130 je super harkulis bahut bada or baari malwahak hawaii jahaaj hone ke baavjood naa sirf har mausam main udaan bhar saktaa he, balki ise choti se choti kisi bhi hawaii pattee par aasaani se utaara ja saktaa he
 The specialty of Hercules does not end here
 jarurat padane par harculis kachi hawaii pattee par bhi land kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, the C-17 Globemaster also has all these features
 inke alaava ro ne apane aviation research centre ke vimaan bhi taiyaar rakhe hue hai
 In fact, these aircraft take part in long-range intelligence operations and are used to keep an eye on enemies and reconnaissance of their movements
 sutron ke mutabik, ro or bhartiya vayusena jald hi apane is plan ko anjaam dene vaale hai
 But they will execute this plan in the day or they choose night time for this plan, it is not clear yet
 iske saath hi agar bhartiya vayusena ke hawaii jahaaj iraqi seemaa main ghuste hai, to unhen iske liye iraqi sarkaar se ijaajat leni padegi, kyonki iraqi sarkaar ko is yojana main shaamil kiye bina is yojana kaa safal hona paanaa thodaa mushkil lagata he
 By the way, if sources are to be believed, if this time, a Komado action is taken to evict the hostages in Iraq, then it can prove fatal for the Indians trapped in the clutches of ISIS, so RAW has prepared such an action plan
 , In which the lives of the hostages will be minimally damaged and if its plan succeeds, soon all the Indians trapped in Iraq will return home
 ab bas intjaar he to us pal kaa ki kab ro apane is plan ko amal main laata he or iraq main fanse bharatiyon ko sakushal ghar waapas laane main kaamyaab hota he

 There is a new twist in the ongoing Bangla dispute in Bihar
 2 din pehle patna hai court ne argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ko unka sarkari bangala 5, deshratn maarg khaali karne kaa farmaan sunaaya jiske baad buudhvaar ko upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne aanan-fanan main tejasvi yadav ko aavantit bangala 1, polo road khaali kar diya
 The story behind this new twist in the Bangla controversy is that after being ousted from power in 2017, the government ordered Tejashwi Yadav to vacate Bungalow 5, Desharatna Marg allotted as Deputy Chief Minister, and he as the Leader of Opposition 1, Polo Road Bungalow allotted
 duusari taraf rajya sarkaar ne susheel modi jo us vakt 1, polo road bangale main rahete the, ko upmukhyamantri ke taur par 5, deshratn maarg bangala aavantit kar diya, lekin dedh saal biit jane ke baad bhi tejasvi yadav ne apana bangala ab tak khaali nahin kiya he
 On the other hand, all their efforts to save the bungalow have also failed
 tejasvi ne bangala bachaane ke liye patna hai court main dedh saal tak lambii ladaai ladi lekin pichley dinon unhen court se bhi raahat nahin mili or unki bangala naa khaali karne kii yachika ko court ne khaarij kar diya
 In the court, Tejashwi also argued that Sushil Modi was staying in his allotted bungalow, so how should he stay there? Meanwhile, in order to pressurize Tejashwi Yadav, Sushil Modi vacated the allotted 1, Polo Road bungalow in a hurry

 gauratlab he ki 2005 main pehali baar upmukhyamantri banane ke baad se ab tak susheel kumaar modi 1, polo road bangale main hi rah rahe the jo tejasvi ko aavantit kiya gaya tha

 Has corruption come to dominate morality in public life

 These doubts have to be overcome

 Today the resources of the central government are more like an ocean than that drop
 parantu hamen yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki kahin aarthik vikaas se praapt laabh par, pyramid ke shikhar par baithe bhaagyashaalee logon kaa hi ekadhikaar na ho jaae
 The basic objective of wealth creation should be to root out the evil of starvation, poverty and meager livelihood from our growing population

 Education is such a ladder that can elevate the people at the lowest rung to the peak of professional and social prestige
 shiksha aisa mantra he jo hamaare aarthik bhagya ko badal saktaa he or aisi daraaron ko paat saktaa he jo samaaj main asamanta paidaa karti hai
 Yet this ladder of education has not reached the required level, to those who need it most

 com / y30fh2uxqma special thank you to @ ipritamofficial # amitabh for creating such a memorable music album for us at @ dharmamovies # 1yearofadhm desh ke pramukh muslim sanghathan jamaat-e-islamic hind ne iees adhikari durga shakti nagpal ke nilamban ko ek masjid kii diwaar dhahaae jane se jodne par afsos jataate hue kaha he ki uttar pradesh kii sarkaar ko apane faisle kaa bachaav karne ke liye musalamaanon ko dhaal nahin bananaa chahie
 The comments jamaat ke sachiv ejeeniyar saleem ne kaha, hamen aisa lagata he ki uttar pradesh kii hukumat apane is faisle kaa bachaav karne ke liye masjid or musalamaanon ko dhaal bana rahi he
 It should not happen
 unhone kaha, iees adhikari ke nilamban ke faisle kaa muslim samudaay kii ore se kisi ne bhi samarthan nahin kiya he
 It is a matter of regret that the suspension of the suspension is being blamed on the Muslims
 is maamle par puri tarah se siyasat ho rahi he
 Salim said, "we want to question the Akhilesh government, how many officers were suspended if there were dozens of riots during his reign?" Why did this government not show such haste in taking action in the case of killing of youths in Ghaziabad's Mussoorie and burning of houses in Pratapgarh? Durga, who was in the limelight for taking action against the mining mafia, was suspended by the Uttar Pradesh administration last week for allegedly ordering the demolition of an ibadgatah wall
 rajya sarkaar kii daleel he ki isse sampradayik maahaul kharaab ho saktaa tha
 Jamaat secretary engineer Salim said, "it seems to us that the Uttar Pradesh government is building a mosque and Muslims to defend its decision
" aisa nahin hona chahie
 He said, the suspension of the IAS officer has not been supported by anyone from the Muslim community
 yah afsos kii baat he ki nilamban kaa thikra musalamaanon par phoda ja rahaa he
 There is a complete politics on this matter
 saleem ne kaha, ham akhilesh sarkaar se sawaal karnaa chaahate hai ki unke shasankaal main darjanon dange hue to unhone kitne adhikariyon ko nilambit kiya? gajiabad ke musuri main yuvakon kii hatya or pratapgarh main logon ke makaan jalaane ke maamle main is sarkaar ne karrwai karne main itani jaldbaaji kyon nahin dikhaai? khanan mafia ke khilaaf karrwai ko lekar sukhiryon main ai durga ko pichley dinon uttar pradesh prashasan ne ek ibaadatgah kii diwaar giraane ke kathith aadesh dene ke aarope main nilambit kar diya tha
 The state government argues that this could have worsened the communal atmosphere

 bharat kii 5 mukkebaajon ne guwahati main jari eibie mahila vishvamukkebazichampionships ke tisare din quarter final main jagah bana lee he
 The boxers who made it to the final-8 round include Gully Jyoti (51 kg), Shashi Chopra (57 kg), Ankushita Boro (64 kg), Neetu (48 kg) and Sakshi (kg)
 jyoti, shashi or ankushita ne din main damakham dikhaate hue aage kaa tikat kataaya, jabaki shaam ko hue mukaable main nitu or sakshi ne baaji maari
 Neetu defeated Bulgaria's imi-mari Todorova in the next round and stood with her teammates
 duusari ore, sakshi ne rus kii indira shudaabyeva ko 4-1 se haraaya
 Italy's Nicoli Rebecca also performed brilliantly, making the first upset of the day and beating European champion Heisen Chelsea in the light-welterweight category
 haryana kii mukkebaaz jyoti or sthaneey mukkebaaz ankushita kaa pradarshan din kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan sabit hua
 Shashi fought carefully in the first round
 unhone apni vipakshi lin lee vei-yi kii kamajori or takat ko achche se bhampa
 Once he got hold of these things of his opposition, it became very easy for him
 jis mukkebaaz ne sabase zyada prabhavit kiya wo thim, sthaneey mukkebaaz ankushita vah din kii sabase sampurna mukkebaaz dikhin
 He performed in the welterweight category in such a way that his opposition Turkish Kagla Aluk would remember this match for a long time
 cancer ko maat dene vaale or vishwa cap 2011 main bharat kii jeet ke hero yuvaraj singh ne is khatarnaak beemaari se jujh rahe 17 bacchon se mulaakaat kii or unhen vishesh tips die
 Playing a 24-ball 42-run knock against Kings XI Punjab on Sunday, Yuvraj, who led his team Sunrisers Hyderabad to victory in the Indian Premier League, was talking to a group of children, many of whom were seven or eight years old
 
 jab ek bachche neyuvarajase poocha ki kya vah dobaaraa chah chakke lagaayenge to chandigarh ke 34 saal ke is ballebaaj ne kaha, 'aap prarthana kiijie, main dobaaraa chah chakke maaroonga
 Although the left-handed batsman said he did not know how he had hit six sixes, he said, "many years have passed since then
" ' yuvaraj ke ek over menchh chhakkebhartiya cricket ke sabase yaadgaar lamhon main se ek he or unhone yah karnama 2007 main dakshin africa main hue vishwa tii20 ke dauraan england ke stuart broad ke over main kiya tha
 An eight-year-old child who had been beating cancer also visited Yuvraj
 use sirf 18 maah kii umr main cancer kaa pataa chalaa tha
 Now this boy studying in fourth grade said that players like Yuvraj are a big inspiration for him
 bachche ne kaha, 'mujhe cricket pasand he or yuvi or suresh raina ko khelte hue dekhakar mujhe kaaphi majaa aata he
 While giving tips to the children, Yuvraj said that the fight against such a disease teaches you that life should never be taken lightly and should not ignore your family or friends
 yuvaraj ko 2011 vishwa cap kaa player aaf da toornament chunaa gaya tha or baad main isi saal unhen cancer kaa pataa chalaa tha
 Apple's much-awaited iphone-5 will be sold at retail stores in India from November 2
 appal india ke pravaktaa ne shuukravaar ko yah jaankaree di
 The spokesperson said distributors Ingram Micro and Redington India will start supplying iphone-5 to retail stores from 2 November
 ingram micro or radington india bharat main appal ke utpaadon ke adhikrut vitarak hai
 Ingram Micro said in a statement that we will start making the iphone-5 available to modern retail outlets and retail outlets from next Friday
 lekin na to ingram micro or na hi radington india ne yphone-5 kii keemat bataai he
 Apple has also not revealed its value in India
 ingram micro ke pravaktaa ke anusaar yphone 5 ko desh ke 40 shaharon main pesh kiya jayega
 The oppression and humiliation of Muhammad Buaji and his associates at the hands of a municipal official became the cause of revolution in Tunisia and then in the Arab world at large
 isse tunisia ke andar virodh pradarshnon ko to hawa mili hi, kai or arab deshon main anwarat andolanon kaa silsilaa chal niklaa
 In the same way, when the Taliban targeted a schoolgirl in Peshawar, Malala Yousafzai, in a merciless manner, the reaction in Pakistan and other Islamic countries was heartening
 is ghatana ke baad se hi dehshat or ghabrahat kaa maahaul tha
 Despite this, people came forward in support of this innocent student
 pakistan or afghanistan main 10 varsh se kam umr ke schuli chaatr-chatraayen baahar nikle (kuch ne apane chehre dhak rakhe the)
 He had placards in his hand: "I am Malala
 ” jo baat sabase zyada prabhavit kar rahi he vah yah ki badi taadaad main islamic sanghathan or musalmaan is mudde par taliban ke khilaaf bol rahe hai
 This is truly heartening because in past years we had seen that there was no response from the orthodox Muslims against the Taliban
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf saamaanya kism ke fatve to duniya bhar ke alaava hindustan main devband ke moulana bhi jari karte rahe hai lekin kisi khaas mudde par taliban kii aalochana se parhez kiya jaataa rahaa
 The population of Muslims in the world is more than two billion and most of these people live everyday normal life
 phir bhi ek baat dukh pahunchaati rahi he ki yah badi aabaadi apane hi samudaay ke un thode-se logon par kaabo karne yaa unhen prabhavit karne main naakaam rahi he jo vastav main majahab or paigambar ke buniyadi usulon ke hi khilaaf bartaav karte aae hai
 The Prophet said, "A strong man is not the one who conquers people by the strength of strength, but he is the one who knows how to control himself when he is angry
" ”musalamaanon ke gusse kii vajah koi bhi samaj saktaa he—damankaaree sarkarein, pashchimi deshon kii muslim mulkon ke maamalon main haaavee hone kii koshish aadi
 All these are the reasons for increasing anger among Muslims
 lekin yah baat nahin bhulani chahie ki islam dharm kii buniyaad ‘‘bismillah ar-rahamaan ar-rahim” he, yani ‘‘shuru karata hum us khuda ke naam par jo sarvaadhik karunamay or sarvaadhik dayaalu he
 "the first volume of the three-volume tarjuma-e-qur'an (translation of the Quran) of the great Islamic scholar Maulana Azad is a complete explanation of these magical words
 koi in shabdon yaa akhlaaq-e-muhammadi yaa ‘pangambar ke shishtachar or vyavhaar’ main chupe gudh arth ko samaj jaae to ummid he ki vah kuran ko bhi samaj jayega jisamen kaha gaya he, ‘‘dusron se nafrat kar khud ko raah se na bhatkaayen or nyaay se dur na jaaen
 Be fair 
 
 ” (kuran 5
 8)
 aage phir kaha gaya he ki ‘‘or kisi ko aisi khubi nahin mil paaegi sivaa unke jo sabar or aatmasanyam rakhte hai” (kuran 41
 35)
 isliye musalamaanon ke liye kshamaa or dayaa ke gunon ko phir se hasil karne kii jarurat he
 For this, Muslims will have to change their attitude and thinking, expressing ideas softly
 nirarthak hinsa ke khuleam pradarshan se nafrat or iskaa virodh karnaa hoga
 Muslims in India have to appreciate that despite all the riots of the past, the horrific experiences of Babri Masjid, Mumbai 1991 and Gujarat 2002, India is a secular country as 85% of Indians (a large part of which are Hindus) remain strongly secular
 
 citigens of justise and pis or jamiya millia islamia kii sanyukt pahal se uniwarsity parisar main haal main yojit ek seminar main vibhinn aayojanon main bolne vaale yaa vibhinn kaaryakramon main hissaa lene vaale zyaadaatar log gaiyr-muslim the
 The way he presented sentimental arguments and arguments against communalism shows that secularism is an integral element of our DNA
 isliye musalamaanon ke liye bhi yah samajhnaa anivaary he ki tang soch se kuch bhi hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 They are proud citizens of India and they should remain so
 bharat main zyaadaatar hinduon kii tarah zyaadaatar musalamaanon kii bhi kanoon or samvidhan tak samaan pahunch he
 But for this, they have to oppose the small portion which instead resorts to unconstitutional routes instead of resolving the issues in a legal way
 is baat se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki alpsankhyakon ke saath bhedbhaav, anuchit vyavhaar or upeksha ke bahut se maamle saamne aate hai, lekin is par bhi gaur karnaa chahie ki duniya bhar ke alpsankhyakon ko isi tarah kii samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, bas badasluki kaa str kam yaa zyada ho saktaa he
 In India, we can not fight aggression against communalism and discrimination but with greater education, dialogue, decency and also with the conviction that a large majority group of India stands for secular values and fairness
 pashchim ke samaaj agar kaaphi had tak apane nasleey masalon ko sulajhane main sakasham sabit hue hai to ham kyon nahin ho sakate?lekhak dilli sthit jamiya millia islamia ke vaais chancelar hai
 Facebook friendships may overwhelm you
 itani baari ki aapako jaan chhudaana mushkil ho saktaa he
 One such case has come up in Singhbhum district of Jharkhand
 jahaan ek yuvak ne fasebuk par ek ladki se dosti kii or jab yuvak ladki se milane pahunchaa to use ladki ke gharavaalon ne bandhak bana liya
 After this, the young man saved his life by paying money
 'dainik hindustan' kii ek khabar ke mutabik, ghatana singhbhum jile ke chakulia shahar kii he
 a young man living here became friends with a girl from Kolkata on Facebook
 donon ke bich ghanton chating hone lage
 Both started liking each other
 donon kii chating kab pyaar main badal gai, yuvak ko pataa hi nahin chalaa
 When love rose, the young man made a plan to meet the girl
 ladki ne yuvak ko milane ke liye kolkata bula liya
 After which, the young man went to Kolkata to meet the girl with the hire car
 yuvak car lekar ladki kii bataai jagah par pahunch gaya
 The waiting girl sat in the young man's car as soon as the family of the vicious girl who had been ambushed there first surrounded the young man's car
 unhone yuvak ko apane ghar le jaakar rassi se baandh diya
 Then beat him brutally
 itnaa hi nahin 24 ghante tak yuvak ko bandhak banaakar rakhane ke baad aropiyon use mukt karne ke liye ek lakh bees hajaar rupee kii rakam maangi
 The helpless young man immediately arranged for the money from his family members, then through his friends, asked for money and gave it to the girl's family members and got them free
 unke changul se chhutne ke baad peedit yuvak apane ghar pahunchaa
 The victim informed the police about the incident
 police ne peedit ke taharir par aropiyon ke khilaaf cese darj kar liya he
 The police has gone to the victim's address
 lekin philhal police ke haath abhi bhi khaali hai
 When the matter rests on the votes of Gujjar and Meena voters, then know that the swords have to be drawn
 donon kii saajha hissedari rajasthan ke kul matadaataaon kaa saatvaan hissaa baithti he
 However, the Congress leadership tried hard to present itself as a well-wisher of both the castes
 lekin antat hua yah ki congress meenaon kii or bhaajapa gurjaron kii party ban gai
 The BJP does not agree that Meena was angered by the agreement he made for reservation for Gujjars without disturbing Meena's reservation
 or ab usee kii aage kii pratikriya ke rup main ve janajatiyaan bhi gurjaron ke haathon apana haq chhinane ko lekar ashankit ho uthi hai jo ki meenaon kii virdohi maani jaati thim
 This fact has played a special role in the BJP not getting a single seat in the assembly elections in seven districts with effective tribal population
 ab is vakt ke halaat ko saamne rakhkar dekhen to kah sakate hai ki bhaajapa ne gurjar netritv kaa samarthan paane ke liye kadi mehnat kii he
 In this context, his ticket to Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla from sawaimadhopur-tonk parliamentary seat is a decisive aspect
 duusari ore, andolan ke dauraan police golibari main gurjaron kii maut ko lekar tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or bansla kaa jamkar virodh karne vaale gurjar netaa prahlaad gunjal bhi bhaajapa main laut aae hai
 Gunjal's return to BJP was also a compulsion of the three BJP, Raje and Gunjal
 pichley do-ek saal main raaje se gunjal ke rishte behad katu rahe hai
 Now Raje has to save the son Dushyant who is contesting from Gurjarabhul Jhalawar seat from the anger of Gurjars
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main baghawat kar ladane, haar jane or duusare dalon se kuch khaas na milane ke baad gunjal ke paas bhaajapa main vaapasi ke alaava koi chaara nahin rah gaya tha
 He wanted a Congress ticket from the quota in the Lok Sabha elections, but was upset after not getting it
 tabhi raaje ne unase sampark saadhaa or mithai khilaakar bhaajapa main le ain
 Said also: "we both have resolved our issues
 '' haalanki, unki vaapasi se bhaajapa kaa ek tabaka khush nahin he
 But parties do not hesitate to place 'small interests' at stake for 'big interests'
 fori taur par dekhen to ab gurjaron ke paas bhaajapa main aa baithe apane netaaon kii ore dekhne ke alaava zyada vikalp nahin rah gaye hai
 But this association of Gurjars with BJP will also not be in bulk as many Gurjars have not forgotten the forgiveness of the killing of 71 people - most of them Gurjars - in the firing
 ek rochak pahalu yah he ki gurjar andolan ke pehle daur main meena bhaajapa ke saath khadey the
 Actually the Meenas were used as a weapon to bring back their agitation from the Gurjars
 lekin us prakriya main nirnaayak bhoomika adaa karne vaale dow
 Kirori Lal Meena is no longer in the BJP and there is no reason why Meena should vote in favor of the BJP on the basis of it
 ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kirodilal meena kya karte hai? isamen do raay nahin ki ve dausa seat jeetne ke liye khun-pasinaa ek kar denge
 One section also says that Congress has made him a scapegoat by quitting his IPS job and standing Laxman Meena from Dausa
 ek or gurjar cheharaa mohammad qamar rabbaani anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit dausa seat se ladane ke liye jammu-kashmir se aae hai
 If there is a good number of Gurjar voters on this seat, then the general voters are also very good
 bhaajapa ke ramkishor meena kii jaden yahaan abhi bahut gahare nahin jam pai hai
 But Kirori is also not confident of his victory
 haar ke dar se hi to unhone congress main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya
 His rebellion would also go to the rebellion while staying in the party
 sansadeey seat par jeet ko lekar agar ve itane hi aashwast hote to ve congress ke tikat par bhi ladakar aasaani se jitate
 But there is no doubt that Kirori are handling their leaves very well
 ve kehete hai ki unka makasad bansla ko haraana he or is tarah se ve apane hi mukhya pratidwandvi savaimadhopur-tonk se congress ke pratyaashee namonarayan meena ke paanv birdari ke andar majboot karenge
 They will campaign for prominent Congress leaders around Meena-dominated areas
 is tarah ve saamaanya tabake ke matadaataaon kaa bhi kuch vot paane kaa intjaam kar rahe hai
 But one thing the Meena leaders should know is that there is a resentment among the voters of every section about them
 in matadaataaon ko lag rahaa he ki surakshit kshetron ke alaava saamaanya siton se bhi meenaon ko khaas tavajjo di ja rahi he
 Bainsla is getting an edge from this perspective
 par duusari ore, ajmer main gurjar netaa sachin payalat ko duusari jatiyon kaa virodh jhelana pad rahaa he
 In fact, the BJP has woven its strategy keeping this aspect in mind that all the fighting castes are losing their base in other communities
 congress ke ek pramukh netaa is par sahmati jataate hue jodhpur se rajput pratyaashee chandresh kumari ke jeetne par bhi andeshaa jataate hai
 Mahipal Maderna did not insist on a ticket for his daughter only because of the absence of such a vote bank
 gurjar-meena pratidwandvita main ek bade ilaake main khoonkhrabe ke andeshe ne police-prashasan ko bhi chaukanna kar diya he
 During a Jains event in Srimahvirji, a fort has already been run a fortnight ago in the Gurjars and Meenas on a horse's plum
 lakshmana meena ke samarthan main sabha karne aae mukhyamantri gahalot ke saamne jab kirodi kii jai-jayakaar sunai di to unki hathdharmita ko bhaanp prashasan kaa sakate main aana lajimi tha
 Like the assembly elections, a meeting of collectors and superintendents of police of Dausa, Karauli, Sawaimadhopur and Bharatpur was held on Mahua Midway in Dausa last week in view of the prevalence of occupation and firing at polling stations
 tay hua ki meena-gurjarbahul ilaakon main atirikt japte kaa intjaam rakhana hoga
 Alarm bells rang already when Hindaun's sub-district Collector Laxmikant Balot received a letter from the Collector of Karauli
 pi
 O
 karne par meena samaaj ne mahapanchayat kii
 The society was of the opinion that the administration has removed the Balot of Meena society under political pressure
 chetavanee bhi di gai ki chunaav-purv unhen phir se padasthaapit na kiya gaya to chunaav bahishkaar ke alaava matdaan partiyon ko gaanvon main ghusane na dene jaise kadam uthaae ja sakate hai
 Gehlot is also aware of the possibility of confrontation
 tabhi to unhone bansla ko bhaajapa main shaamil kiye jane kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki yahi vah shaks he, jisane andolan ke jariye puure rajya bhar ko maheene bhar tak bandhak banaae rakhaa, desh bhar main rajya kii bhi badanaami hui
 Not only was there a financial loss, but also many lives lost
 lekin duusari ore ek bade tabake ko yah bhi lagata he ki aakhir meenaon ke prati itani udaartaa kyon? vidhansabha chunaavon main ve surakshit ke alaava saamaanya siton se bhi jite or 31 vidhayakon ke saath jaaton se bhi zyada taqatvar banakar ubhare
 He also has a question as to why the Meenas opposed the Gujjars being brought to the Scheduled Tribes? In the assembly elections, the Dhanka candidates of the Scheduled Tribes responded strongly to the dominance of the Meenas
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhi meena pratyaashiyon ko kamjor karne ke liye unhen utaara gaya he
 It seems that Gurjar and Meena will either do their damage or they will get votes in retaliation for each other
 saamaanya tabake ke matadaata to donon ko lekar kudh rahe hai
 -with Rubina Kazi and Prakash ashamed: India Today rajdhani dilli main 16 disambar ko ek chalati bas main balaatkaar ke behad vibhats maamle ke baad chaaron taraf se juvenil justise act main badlaav ko lekar awaajen uthin, lekin kuch nahin hua
 Now once again this issue has come up and this time the Supreme Court has raised it
 ek maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne hatya or rape jaise sangeen aparaadhon main naaballigon kii sanlipta par chintaa jaahir karte hue centre sarkaar ko kaha he ki vah ek baar phir juvenil justise (jeje) act par gaur kare
 The court has said that by May 1, the Center should clear its stand in this matter
 darasal supreme court haryana main hui ek hatya ke maamle main umrakaid kii sajayaafata kii apil par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In his appeal filed in the Supreme Court, he has said that he was a minor at the time of the murder
 iske liye usne skool kaa ek certificate bhi diya he, lekin sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vah vaardaat ke vakt balig tha
 In a hearing held on Monday, the Supreme Court bench said that the way the cases of minors are coming up is worrying
 aise main ab vakt aa gaya he ki is mudde par koi kadam uthaaya jaae
 The court asked Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi to talk to the government and tell the court whether the government is considering the JJ Act
 court ne ek may tak sarkaar kii raay court main bataane ke liye kaha he
 Significantly, on 16 December 2012, the movement for change in the law for minors started after the case of rape and murder in a moving bus
 maamla supreme court tak bhi pahunchaa tha or peedita ke parijanon ne bhi maang kii thi ki ek naaballig ko faansee kii sajaa di jaae
 In this case, four people were sentenced to death, while one minor was sent for reform for three years
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki sangeen maamalon main 18 saal nahin balki 16 saal tak waalon ko bhi balig kii tarah mana janaa chahie
 However, this petition was rejected by the Supreme Court
 idhar, sarkaar ne bhi jeje act main badlaav karne se inkaar kar diya tha, lekin ab agali sunwaayee main tay hoga ki is maamle main sarkaar kaa rukh kya he
 Recently, Salman Khan's sister Arpita got married with great pomp
 lekin shaadi se itar jo ek khabar sabase adhik charchaa kaa kaaran bani, vah thishahrukh khan or salmaan kii dosti
 Shah Rukh and Salman appeared together with Arpita just before Arpita's wedding
 arpita kii resepshan party main bhi shahrukh ne shirkat kii, lekin salmaan ke 'tevar' yahi bataa rahe hai jaise donon khan ke rishton main khatas abhi baaki he
 Actually, this is not the first time Shah Rukh and Salman are hugging
 saal 2008 main katrina caff kii berthde party main doston ke bich padi daraar ko isse pehle bhi paatane kii khub koshishen hui hai
 But what Salman said in the episode of 'bigg Boss' on Sunday night forced him to think if there was really a 'friendship' between the two Khans
 yah sambhav bhi he kyonki yaad karen to 2008 main hi ek intervyuu ke dauraan salmaan ne saaf shabdon ke kaha tha ki agar bhagwaan bhi shahrukh or unhen milaane kii koshish karen to kuch hone vaala nahin he
 In Sunday night's episode, Salman's style was once again seen when Sonakshi Sinha asked him that now there is a friendship between you and Shahrukh, not behind the smile of Salman's' Tevar 'bigg Boss'
 As soon as Sonakshi questions Shahrukh's friend on the set, Salman immediately says - there is nothing like that
 sonakshi ne unase phir poocha ki abhi to shaadi main photo-voto
 
 
 
 salmaan ne muskuraate hue phir jawaab diya, 'kuch nahin badla
 Nothing changed
 
 
 aisa kuch nahin he
 'the special thing is that when Salman was saying all this, he insisted twice,' Nothing has changed '
 jaahir taur par pichley dinon salmaan or shahrukh kii jaisi tasviren saamne ai hai or ravivaar ke episod main salmaan ne jis tarah se jawaab diya he, usase spasht he ki arpita or parivaar kii khushi ke liye bhale hi 'badshaah' or 'dabang' ne ek-duusare ko gale lagaaya ho, lekin vyaktigat str par donon ke bich kuch bhi nahin badla he
 That is, 'tevar' of 'dabangg Khan' is still strong

 The Supreme Court today questioned the appointment of PJ Thomas to the post of Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC)
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki bhrashtachar kaa maamla lambit hone ke baavjood thomas pad par kaise bane rah sakate hai? haalanki, ucchtam nyaayalay ke sawaalon par centre sarkaar ne kaha ki yadi dosha-rahit nishtha yogyata kaa ek maandand he to sabhi nyaayik evam sanvaidhanik niyuktiyaan jaanch ke daayre main hongi
 a bench headed by Chief Justice SH Kapadia also said that as CVC, pending a criminal case against him, he himself would feel embarrassed in every case when the CBI deliberates with him
 etorni general ji i vaahnavati kii ore se ek silband cover main thomas kii niyukti se jude dastavej saunpe jane ke baad nyaayalay ne kaha ‘file dekhe bina hi ham is baat ko lekar chintit hai ki ek aapraadhik maamle main aropit vyakti sivisi ke taur par kaise kaam karegaa
 The bench said that it would look into the file and next hear the case after two weeks
 nyaayadhish nyaayamurti ke es radhakrishnan or swatantra kumaar kii sadsyta vaali peeth ne kaha ‘ham ek saath baithenge or puri file dekhenge
 Thomas is named in the charge sheet in a case related to palmolein exports
 sheersh adaalat kii peeth ne apane samaksh file rakhe jane ke baad kaha ki vah jaananaa chaahegi ki kya yogyata ke maapdandon kaa paalan kiya gaya
 The bench told Attorney General GE Vahanvati that when Thomas is named in a charge sheet, the issue of how he will be able to act will arise all the time
 vaahnavati ne spasht karnaa chaha ki pamolin niryaat maamle main thomas kii koi sanliptata nahin he or unke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati kii prakriya shuru nahin hui he
 The bench, however, said, "it may happen that at all times it is said that as a CVC you cannot forward a file because you are an accused in a criminal case
" aap sivisi ke rup main kaise kaam karenge?’ nyaayalay kii peeth ne kaha ‘har maamle main sibiai ko use (sivisi ko) report kerani hoti he
 The bench said, "under service conditions, even the name of a person cannot be considered for promotion against which the charge sheet is pending
" ’ isane kaha ‘‘is charan main unke khilaaf 2002 se aarope patr lambit he unke naam par padonnati ke liye bhi vichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 We are just asking if he will be able to act as a CVC
 yah khud bhi unke liye sharmindagi kii baat hogi
 "the court said" because this matter is very important, we will give our order on this basis
 ’ peeth ne spasht kiya ki yah maamle kii gunvattta nahin balki sirf yah jaananaa chaahati he ki kya sivisi ke rup main thomas kii niyukti ke samay yogyata maapdandon sahit samoochee prakriya kaa paalan kiya gaya
 Noting that the entire procedure was followed, Vahanvati told the court that every such judicial appointment could come under surveillance if such allegations were considered
 peeth ne kaha ki pamolin maamla sivisi kii rajya ikai dwaara sanchalit kiya gaya or thomas kendriya sanghathan kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 The Attorney General stated that JM Lyngdoh, who filed the petition, had himself prepared Thomas's Annual Confidential Report (ACR) and in that he had stated Thomas's loyalty beyond doubt
 centre for public interest litigeshan or kaaman coj dwaara daayar yachika main lagaae gaye aaropon ko khaarij karte hue vaahnavati ne kaha ki yachika main die gaye bayaan sahi nahin hai
 The petition questions Thomas's appointment as CVC
 isse purv sheersh adaalat ne yah kahkar thomas kii niyukti se sambandhit file kaa nirikshan karne kaa faisla kiya ki vah jaananaa chaahati he ki kya yogyata maapdandon kaa paalan kiya gaya
 Thomas's name is also allegedly involved in covering up the 2G spectrum scam
 peeth ne kaha ki vah yah bhi jaananaa chaahegi ki kya salaah mashvira prakriya kaa paalan kiya gaya
 The petition argued that Thomas was considered for the important post despite objections raised by the Leader of the Opposition
 yachikakartaon ne tark diya ki thomas ko ‘trutiheen satyanishth’ vyakti nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki pamolin niryaat maamle main unka naam aarope patr main us samay aayaa jab vah rajya ke khaadya evam aapurti mantralay main sachiv the or unhen ek sthaneey adaalat se jamaanat mili thi
 The PIL stated that Thomas could not be appointed as CVC in view of 'conflict of interest' as he was recently working as Secretary in the Telecom Ministry and was involved in the 2G spectrum scam There were allegations in which, according to the petitioners, the treasury suffered a loss of 70 thousand crores
 yachika daayar karne vaale sanghathanon ne nyaayalay se yah nirdesh dene kaa aagrah kiya ki thomas kii niyukti is aadhaar par avaidh he ki isamen kathith taur par kendriya satarkta ayog adhinium kii dhara chaar kaa ulanghan hua kyonki pradhanmantri or grahamantri ne netaa vipaksh kii aapatti ke baavjood thomas ke naam par jor diya jisase pataa chalata he ki sarkaar pehle hi unke naam par faisla kar chuki thi
 The petition alleged that the Prime Minister and the Home Minister recommended the name of Thomas despite objections raised by the Leader of the Opposition
 isliye netaa vipaksh apni asahmati darj karaane ke liye vivash huin
 Hence his presence in the appointment was in vain
 ’ isamen aage kaha gaya ‘jab desh kii sarvocch adaalat (ucchtam nyaayalay) or sansad ne yah vyavastha kar di ki sivisi kii niyukti teen sadasyeey samiti dwaara kii jaaegi jisamen netaa vipaksh bhi shaamil hon to yah spasht he ki samiti ekamat yaa aam sahmati se faisla karegi
 Nowhere was it said that the committee would decide by majority vote
 ’yachika main kaha gaya ‘agar aise hi hota he to netaa vipaksh kii maujuudagi vyarth ho jaaegi or hameshaa pradhanmantri tathaa grahamantri kii hi chalegi or niyukt kiya jane vaala vyakti sarkaar dwaara namankit hoga
 Therefore the way Thomas was appointed is illegal and is not in accordance with the law

 5 Stardirector: R
 balkeekalakaarashmitabh bachchan, dhanush or akshara hasanar
 Balki is one of the few Bollywood film directors who tries to make a film out of the box, a film that has a new story, good music and every aspect of entertainment
 phir chaahe vah chini kam rahi ho yaa phir paa
 Amitabh also has a name in the same episode
 film kii kahani ekadam nai he
 Within the film, the passion of films is presented in a different way
 amitabh bachchanaur dhanush kii jugalbandi kamaal kii he
 Akshara Haasan has also come out with these two stars
 yah balki kaa ek or mjedaar prayog he
 How powerful Amitabh is a drunk in the story
 kabhi mumbai hero banane ke liye aayaa yah shaks apni aawaaj kii vajah se maat kha jaataa he
 Dhanush is a silent-slayer in which Bollywood is a great insect
 vah actor bananaa chahta he
 He meets Akshara, and she decides to help him and mixes Amitabh's voice and Dhanush to make him a princess
 phir kai utaar-chadhaav or ahm kaa takaraav hota he
 The whole film is good but in the second half the story seems a bit drawn
 editing thodi tite hoti to jaayaka bad jaataa
 However, only Balki could do such a story
 amitabh bachchanaki acting ke liye kuch bhi kahana kam hoga
 Then, if they get the support of a director like Balki, then their artistry gets charmed
 amitabh kaa piyakkad andaaj kamaal he
 The way he appears at the age of 72 is refreshing
 unki aawaaj to khaas myne rakhti hi he or balki ne film main iskaa bharpoor istemaal karke apni samajhadaari kaa hi parichay diya he
 Raanjhanas are also amazing
 chote shahar ke ladke kaa role ho to dhanush ke haath puri tarah khul jate hai
 This tuning with Amitabh is very well established
 akshara ne acchhee shuruyaat kii he, acchhee lagi hai or role main feet baithi hai
 The biggest thing about earning 'shmitabh' is the acting of its artists
 unke aage film kii kahani bhi gaun ho jaati he
 The budget of the film is 40 crores
 bataaya jaataa he
 Big Starcast and Word of Mouth will also do a lot of work
 vaise jab bollywood aksar rimek or bina sir-pair kii filmon main ulajhaa najar aata he, us daur main balki ekadam fresh idia ke saath aae hai
 Apparently the film is not very much like the single screen theaters but due to the combination of Amitabh, Dhanush and Balki, it makes one to see Amitabh once

 The court sentenced Sandesh for the society

 Many students are taught in rural schools by teachers who have little knowledge about these students

 Most of what is taught to children in South Asia is "procedural" or Rattamar

 "it is not enough just to spend time in school," said Philip Lee Horow, Vice President of the South Asia region of the World Bank

 sabko ajukeshan sunishchit karne ke liye is report main sifarish kii gai he ki teaching quality sudhaarney ke liye tatkaal hastkshep kiya jaae
 It also suggested that higher and cleaner standards be enforced, often abstaining children living in abstentions and prohibiting promotions without merit

 kyonki is puure drame main lalu or unka parivaar bhi shaamil he
 Sanjay Singh said that it is Lalu's game which he mixes even in jail and is not afraid of the law
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu ko khud ke khuda hone kaa bhram ho gaya he, magar aisa nahin he
 JDU has also questioned former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav and Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav as to why they are silent on this whole issue? Sanjay Singh said that if RJD feels that there is a conspiracy of JDU to bring Lalu's 2 sevadars to jail, then they should come forward and say
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki yah pehali baar nahin he ki lalu jab jail gaye to unke sevak bhi unki seva karne ke liye koi aparaadh kar ke kisi bahaane jail pahunch gaye ho
 To do this, the Lalu family pays a hefty amount to their servants

 yahi vajah he ki sharadiya navaratri main nau dinon tak durga maa kii puja ke baad dasven din dashahra manaaya jaataa he

 It has been said in the world of books - if you think there is a book that has not been written yet, then you should write that book
 sangeet or kalaon ke jane pahachaane adhyeta yatindra mishra kii tazaa kitaab akhtari is naul par sadiq aati he
 The identity of Akhtari Ghazal Singer is a book centered on Begum Akhtar
 isse pehle hindi main begum akhtar par buree kitaaben bhi na ke baraabar thim acchhee kitaab to ek bhi nahin thi
 After reading this book, it can be said in a jumla that Akhtari is the first and only good book in Hindi on Begum Akhtar, and from this perspective, Akhtari has further enriched Hindi
 yatindra kii pahchaan lambey vaqt se praathmik taur par ek kavi kii rahi he
 They have also considered themselves to be poets first
 haalanki kala or sangeet par unki gadhy pustaken lambey vaqt se aati rahi hai, inamen sur kii baradari, vismay kaa bakhaan, girija aadi pramukh hai
 But from his previous book Lata Surgatha and now from this book Akhtari, he is becoming a must-have name for writing on art-culture in Hindi
 lata sur gaatha is arth main aitihaasik kitaab he ki isamen lata mangeshkar kaa 369 pannon kaa ek vistrut or athmiya intervyuu shaamil he jo ki na to isse pehle kabhi mumkin hua na isse baad main mumkin hoga
 The latest book talks to different people on Akhtari Begum Akhtar's personality and his fun
 yatindra is kitaab main sampadak kii bhoomika main he
 It was very difficult to play this role in the context of this book, but Yatindra has played it successfully
 is kitaab main sangeet or kala ke anek parkhi logon jaise- saleem kidawai, iqbaal rizvi, rakshanda jaleel, dow
 Praveen Jha, embellished Saktawat etc
 have written excellent articles describing the art and life of Begum Akhtar, while many interesting and intimate memoirs of Begum Akhtar have been recorded quoting different people
 kitaab kii teesri khaas baat he isamen shaamil saakshaatkaar
 Among these, there is a very rare interview of Acharya Jupiter of Begum Akhtar as well as a detailed interview of two prominent disciples of Begum Akhtar, Shanti Hiranand and Rita Ganguly
 iske alaava begum kii gayikee ke takneekee paksh ko gahanta se vishleshit karata mashhoor gayika shubha mudgal kaa bhi ek behtareen lekh he
 The work of editing this book must have been difficult because the book was not only written from different art-circles of the present era but also included some old articles focusing on Begum Akhtar, some of which are also translated
 isi tarah unki shishyaaon se ek vistrut or stareey baat karnaa bhi sabase bas kii baat nahin lagati
 It is also a misdeed to recount uncountable memoirs about uncultured people
 so is puure udhyam ko bagoor dekhe jane kii zarurat he
 The decoration and cover of the book is also going to enhance the beauty of the beautiful book
 lekhan or sampadan ke alaava is kitaab main hamen yatindra mishra ek behtareen kellingrapher ke taur par bhi nazar aate hai
 The book is compulsory for Begum Akhtar and music lovers, but it should be read by every person who wants to get into the depths of Hindustani Tehzeeb
 america vayusena ne ek sikh vayusainik ko dadhi, pagadi or lambey kesh rakhane kii anumati de di he

 The former Prime Minister of this country was imprisoned, started illegal lotteries, crores were reported after the news of NBC News, the Air Force gave this exemption after receiving reports from Sikh American Veterans Alliance and American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
 meccord vayusena stesan main chaalak dal ke pramukh, bajva duty par maujuud rahane vaale aise pehle vayusainik ban gaye hai jinhen vayusena main seva dete hue sikh dharm ke anukool pahanaave ke siddhanton ke paalan kii anumati mili he

 barish se logon ko to garmi se raahat mili thi par duusari ore kisaanon kii chintaa badha di
 Dust storms and rains throughout northern India including Himachal, Haryana and Punjab have damaged farmers' grains

 When Adhir Chaudhary's name was announced as the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the Lok Sabha, many people were surprised by this, but not by those who already know him
 pashchim bengal se pichley do dashak se congress ke saansad chune ja rahe choudhary achche-bure har daur main party ke saath khadey rahe hai
 He has always protected his stronghold Murshidabad in the wave of the CPI (M) and then Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC)
 1970 ke dashak main adheer kuch samay tak naksali andolan ke saath rahe or apni pareshaaniyaan yahaan tak badha leen ki unhen saat saal kii jail kii sajaa bhi hui
 Violent legacy has remained with them since that time and whatever they have achieved after that, they have done it on the same heritage
 1996 main jab unhone vidhayak ke rup main pehali chunavi jeet hasil kii thi, tab ve ek darjan se adhik hatyaon ke aaropee hone ke saath bhagode bhi the or unki giraftaar kaa warrant jari kiya gaya tha
 Despite so many criminal cases, he won the election by over 26,000 votes
 2000 kii baadh ke baad kiye raahat kaaryon se adheer ne khud ko aprihaary rup main sthapit kar liya
 In Ramadan, free food for Namazis or treatment of the poor, financial assistance for the daughter's wedding or attending the funeral, the impatient were always ready for everyone
 anbhavi congressi amitabh chakravarti kehete hai, ''agar kahin chhedchhad kii koi ghatana hui he, to adheer ko ek phone kar dena paryaapt tha
 He used to take full news of the criminals
 beharampur kii mahilaayein to raat main bhi baahar ghoomte hue khud ko surakshit mahasoos karti thim
 There were no incidents of harassment or rape in Murshidabad
 ''adheer khap kii tarah panchayatein lagaakar vivaadon kaa nipataara kar dete the or logon ne vivaadon ke niptaare ke liye police yaa adaalaton ke paas jane kii tulana main un par adhik bharosa kiya
 Manoj Chakraborty, chief whip of the Congress in the Bengal Assembly, says, "the common feeling among the poor is that the impatient cannot do wrong things
" '' galat karne waalon ko aisi sajaaen milin ki aage koi himmat nahin kar paaya or is tarah unke prabhavakshetra main aparaadh khatm ho gaya
 Meanwhile, his political journey continued
 unhone 1999 main murshidaabad ke beharampur se baari antar se loksabhaa chunaav jeeta
 In fact, Mamata's differences with the Congress grew with the promotion of young Turks like the impatient of the veteran Congressmen of Bengal like Somen Mitra
 adheer jaise 'aparaadhiyon' ko tikat dene ke party ke faisle kaa virodh karte hue mamata ne to ek baar aatmahatya kii dhamkee bhi di thi
 The rise of impatient in the party was slow but continuous
 ve 2012 main upie-2 sarkaar main rail rajyamantri bane or 2014 main pradesh congress ke pramukh banaae gaye
 His graph fell slightly in September 2018 when the Congress, along with secular forces, was looking for an anti-modi platform
 adheer ko pad chhodie ke liye kaha gaya kyonki ve mamata ke khilaaf bahut aakraamak rahete the
 And so was it
 mamata par hamale karne ke liye, ve aksar bhagava party ke saath khadey najar aate the or bhaajapa ke lagaae aaropon ko or majbootee se rakhte the
 There was once a speculation that the impatient might change their place to save their seats
 lekin unhone congress ummidavaar ke rup main hi chunaav ladaa or 80,000 voton se adhik antar (bhaajapa or makapa ne kamjor ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaara jisase madad mili) se jite
 Apart from victory, there are many other reasons why Congress has chosen him for the post of Leader in Lok Sabha
 nishtha or unke sanghathanaatmak kaushal ke alaava ek or baat jo unke paksh main gai vah thi sansad main mukhya vipakshi aawaaj banane ko lekar congress kii chintaa
 And they have already proved themselves
 nae satr main pehle hi bhaashan main, unhone congress ke naare, 'bharat indira he or indira bharat haió ko phir se taaja karte hue apni tippanee main bhaajapa ko nishane par liya or 'kahaan maa ganga or kahaan gandi naalee' tak bol gaye jisko lekar vivaad ho gaya
 This is just the beginning

 Book Name Kavita Viren: Complete Poems of Viren Dangwal, Publisher: Navarun Prakashan, Ghaziabad, Price 475 Rs
 puri manushyata ke prati gaharaa sarokaar rakhane vaale kavi kii prakashit-aprakashit, anudit kavitaaon kaa sankalanakavita viren main hindi ke prasiddh kavi divangat viren dangwaal kii sabhi prakashit-aprakashit or unki anudit kavitaayen sankalit kii gai hai, jisaki bhoomika unke samakaleen kavi mangalesh dabraal ne likhi he
 Regarding Dangwal, one of his contemporary poets Alok Dhanwa has rightly said that Viren is an ethnic poet of Hindi
 viren ko hindi kshetra ke bhugol or samaaj kii jitani pahchaan or parakh thi, utani kam hi kaviyon ko rahi he
 Viren's poems include all kinds of fruits, flowers, grains, seasons, animals, birds, festivals and idioms
 is drushti se kaha ja saktaa he ki ve nagarjun-trilochan kii parampara main hai
 But Viren's poems are different in that they are set in the backdrop of more towns and small towns than in villages
 lekin unki kavyadrushti deshkal kii simaaon ke paar jaati he
 His concern is for the whole of humanity
 unka apane parivesh se gaharaa lagaav rahaa he
 Not only from his nature and humans, but also from inanimate objects
 viren saadhaaran se saadhaaran vastuon ko puraa sammaan dete hue unke bheetar kii saadhaaranta ko udghaatit karte hai
 In this way they establish the dignity of life
 viren kaa maananaa he ki prem or karunaa ne hi manushya ko manushya banaaya he
 Today, all kinds of distortions in life have come due to being away from them
 farmaaishein unki ek dilachasp kavita he jisamen ve kehete hai—kute mujhe thodaa-sa apana sneh de / gaay mamata bhaaluu mujhe de de yaar / shahad ke liye thodaa / apana mardaana pyaar / bhens de thodaa bairagipan bandar furti / apni akl se mujhe bakhshae rahanaa siyaar
 In the poems of Viren, there is the euphoria of life, temperament and frivolity
 lekin ve jivan ke andhere konon ko bhi acchhee tarah jaanate hai or uski padtaal karte hai
 He has also kept a close watch on all the discrepancies and he has also exposed the layers of exploitative system but in doing so his tone is not very harsh
 dukh kavita main ve kehete hanru nakli dukhi aadmi kii aawaaj main / tin kaa pattar bajataa he / masalan maare gaye logon par / raajpurush kaa rundha hua galaa
 These fake people have earned all the means by exploiting the weaker sections with deceit and dishonesty
 unki chamak-damak ko dekhakar aam aadmi ko apni eemaandaaree vyarth lagane lagati he
 But Viren Saaf says that improperly achieved prosperity can never be justified
 beyimaanon, shoshakon or nakkaalon kii ekta ko viren acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 But he is sure that the public will also be united against them
 ve kehete hai "inhen sadakon se chalakar / aate rahe hai aattaayi / inhen par chalakar aaenge / hamaare bhi jan
 The poet has a clear indication that our people will come and change the situation
 unki koshishon se andhera chant jayega or ujle din aaenge
 In the words of the poet - we have come when we will walk so many hundred thousand years / even after that, we will definitely come on bright days
 *** Opposition parties have started a siege even before the results of the Lok Sabha elections
 23 may ko aa rahe loksabhaa chunaav nateezon se pehle aise prayaas dekhne ko bhi mil rahe hai, lekin dilachasp baat ye he ki vipakshi dalon ko ekamanch par laane kaa prayaas congress yaa sapa-basapa or tiemasi jaise bade dalon kii taraf se nahin, balki dakshin kii raajnneeti karne vaale telugu desham party ke adhyaksh or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu kar rahe hai
 Chandrababu Naidu has also met Congress President Rahul Gandhi, BSP President Mayawati and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav
 aap mukhiya arvind kejariwal va ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar se bhi naidu baatcheet kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, the discussion is also why Naidu is trying to form a coalition of anti-modi parties to form the government
 naidu kii bhagdaud ke peeche kai kaaran ginaae ja rahe hai
 The first is that Modi, who was part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), wants to avenge the breakdown of the relationship with the government
 saath hi unke survey ke mutabik, bijepi ko upi main 30 ke andar or desh main endie ko 200 ke andar siten milane kaa anumaan he
 While the Congress as the largest party of the opposition is going to win around 125 seats
 yahi anumaan naidu ko takat de rahaa he
 According to sources, Chandrababu Naidu, popularly known as Babu, did not meet Congress President Rahul Gandhi for the second time in 24 hours after meeting Sharad Pawar, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati
 darasal, babu chaahate hai ki 1990 yaa 1996 vaala siyaasi prayog naa doharaaya jaae, jab sabase badi party congress sarkaar se baahar rahi or gathjod kii sarkaar jaldi gir jaae
 At the same time, the Congress is not ready to give up the claim of the Prime Minister's chair in the case of being the largest party to join the government
 dalit netaa kaa naam badha sakate hai rahulsutra bataate hai ki 125 siton kii surat main rahul khud piem banane kii bajaay party ke kisi dalit netaa kaa naam aage kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, it will be difficult for all the other parties including Mayawati to oppose the country's first Dalit PM
 saath hi rahul apana dalit prem bhi jaahir kar sakenge
 Two names emerge in such a situation
 pehla susheel kumaar scindia kaa, jo maharashtra ke mukhyamantri, andhra pradesh ke rajyapal, desh ke grih mantri rah chuke hai
 He is also considered as the Yes Man of the Gandhi family
 maharashtra se aane vaale scindia ke naam par maratha kshatrap sharad pavaar bhi hami bhar denge
 The other name is Meera Kumar, who has been the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, a Union Minister, has contested the President
 vahiin dalit ke saath mahila hona unke haq main jaataa he
 Overall, political seats are being laid fast
 siyaasi mulakaaton kaa silsilaa bhi jari he
 The most important thing is what results come
 isliye 23 taarikh ke nateezon ke baad hi asli siyaasi ganit kaa pataa chalegaa

 In the Bulandshahr violence case, the police claimed to have recovered the mobile phone of the martyr Inspector Subodh Singh from the house of accused Prashant Nut, about two months after the incident
 upi police ke is daawey par prashanth ke parivaar ne sawaal uthaae hai or chaunkaane vaale aarope lagaae hai
 Prashant's family has alleged that the police themselves showed this seizure by keeping a mobile at their house and Prashant is being forcefully implicated in the case

 The family claims that the Jat people are rich and the police together with them is framing the poor
 parivaar kaa aarope he ki police ko koi nahin mila to garib ke ladke ko fansaa rahi he

 Ironically, neither one unit of electricity nor one inch of land will be irrigated by the project to Odisha

 Modi government has taken a step towards changing the picture of agriculture sector of the country and increasing the income of farmers
 iske liye modi sarkaar sabase zyada contract forming par jor de rahi he, lekin rajya sarkarein philhal isamen haath daalane se kataraa rahi hai
 In such a situation, how will the Modi government fulfill the dream of contract-making? Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday emphasized on contract-making in the conference of state agriculture ministers
 haalanki rajyon se aae krishi mantriyon ne is par koi khaas tavajjo nahin di
 While the conference included agriculture ministers from most of the bjp-ruled states, they too did not express their opinion on this contract formation
 modi sarkaar 2
 In the first budget of 0, in order to improve the condition of farmers, the most attention has been given on zero budgeting and contract forming
 yahi vajah he ki bajet ke teen din ke baad hi sarkaar ne desh bhar ke rajyon ke krishi mantriyon kaa sammelan bula liya
 In this conference, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told the Agriculture Ministers from the states that they should show interest in contract formation and state governments should take steps in this direction
 is dauran krishi mantri ne contract farming ke maamalon ko bhi protsaahan dene kii baat bhi kahi, lekin rajyon ke krishi mantri apni ore se is disha main kuch bhi nahin bole
 In fact, for the last 10 years, the central government has been formulating a strategy for contract farming, but due to opposition from farmer organizations, the state governments have not been able to take steps in this direction
 varisht patrkaar arvind kumaar singh ne aajtak
 Talking to in, said that the Central Government may make any number of schemes in the field of agriculture, but the work of the state governments is to implement it
 isiilie contract forming ko lekar modi sarkaar yojana bhale hi bana le, lekin rajyon ke bina sahmati ke ise amali jama nahin pahanaaya ja saktaa he
 He says that the state governments are reluctant to join hands in contract farming as the farmers' organization is opposed to it
 kisaanon ko aashaanka he ki contract forming kaa kanoon ban jane ke baad unki jameen par corporate or multinational companiyaan kabja kar lengi
 Their apprehension is not completely unfounded, if the corporate starts farming then what will the farmer do? In countries where contract farming is adopted, the condition of farmers is not very good
 iskaa jeeta jaagta udaahaaran brazil saamne he
 Contract farming: Contract farming means that the farmer cultivates his land, but not for himself but for someone else
 contract forming main kisaan ko paisa nahin kharch karnaa padataa
 In this, a company or a man contracts with the farmer that the contractor will buy a particular crop grown by the farmer for a fixed price
 isamen khaad, beej se lekar sinchai or mazdooree sab kharch contractor ke hote hai
 The contractor only tells the farmer the methods of farming
