 kuch hi ghanton main bhartiya vayusena ko 1971 kii ladaai ke baad pehali baar hamalaa karnaa tha, wo bhi ek aise desh par jo ab parmaanu shakti sampann tha
 '4 in the morning on 13 June
 30 baje sabhi payalton ne ladaai ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hokar apane squadran par report kiya, lekin abhi tak 'hamale' kaa koi aadesh nahin mila tha
 We sat fully prepared till morning and then 12
 30 baje ham baith gaye
 ' is diary ke alaava vayusena ke ek purv mig 21 payalat ne NDTV ko bataaya ki june 1999 ko keval line of control ke is paar tak hi nahin, balki us paar bhi jane ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 On the condition of anonymity, the mig-21 pilot, who was posted in the same region, told that 'we were having food, then we were sent to the operation room
 cmand se ek officer aayaa tha
 He said that Balloon would go up in the morning
 aap sabhi pehle hamale ke sadsy honge
 ' do mig-21 ko tide escort ke taur par tainaat kiya gaya tha, jinka kaam chaklala sthit airbase par hamale ke liye ja rahe chaar mig-27 bamavarshak vimaanon ko najdiki suraksha muhaiyaa karana tha
 Their task was to destroy the Chaklala runway, so that fighter aircraft could not fly from there
 inkaa kaam yah bhi tay tha ki agar chaaron hamalavar mig-27 yadi pakistani fiteron dwaara intercept ho jate hai, to ye unhen suraksha cover uplabdh karaaen
 In addition, four mig-29 aircraft were to clear the way for the mig 21 aircraft going for the attack, so that it could successfully complete its mission
 inako yah jimmedaari di gai thi ki jab tak bhartiya hamalavar vimaan apane target tak na pahunchen, tab tak ye hawa main unhen puri tarah suraksha pradaan karen
 Altogether 16 fighter planes were selected for this operation
 kuch anya squadran ko bhi mishan se jude anya kaam die gaye the
 It is written in the diary, 'we took Pakistani currency and also wrote letters for our families

 The order to stop the mission arrived at around 12 pm

 Flying patrolling continued in Pindi and Kahuta, ready to catch any Indian air strike
 keval epa-16 hi khatra nahin the
 Indian pilots were aware that the French-made Crotel and the China-made HQ2B, a ground-to-air missile, were ready to destroy any Indian attack fighter
 crotel kii maarak duuri kareeb 10 kilometre kii he or yah bhartiya ladaaku fiter kii ore hawa se bhi doguni speed se badhati
 At the same time, the Chinese-made HQ2B missile was no less threatening
 is missile main 190 kilo warhed le jane kii kshamta he jo apane target ko 20 kilometre kii duuri par hi pakad leti he
 The missile moved towards the Indian fighter jet at a speed of 1150 meters per second
 apane target ke najadik pahunchate hi is missile par laga proximity fus khul jaataa he or yah joardaar dhamaakaa karti he
 It was difficult for any Indian fighter jet to survive
 tippaniyan However, during the Kargil War, the Indian Air Force had a distinct edge
 bharat ke paas pakistan kii tulana main ladaaku vimaanon kii sankhya zyada thi or vah zyada behatar hathiyaaron se las the, jisase vah dushman ko intercept kar sakate
 Fighter jets like mig 29, Mirage 2000 of India have a provision for long-range fire-missile air-missiles, whereas Pakistan's fighter aircraft did not have this facility
 isse yah saaf he ki pakistani airforce bhartiya ladaaku vimaanon ko keval dogphite (aamane-saamne kii ladaai) main hi anges kar paati kyonki dushman jahaajon main choti duuri kii maarak kshamta vaali or america main bani sivinder missile hi lag paati thim
 Perhaps it was this growth that caused the government to prepare for the airstrikes, but the Indian government's decision not to carry on the Kargil war kept the plan a secret till now

 It was difficult for any Indian fighter jet to survive
 tippaniyan However, during the Kargil War, the Indian Air Force had a distinct edge
 bharat ke paas pakistan kii tulana main ladaaku vimaanon kii sankhya zyada thi or vah zyada behatar hathiyaaron se las the, jisase vah dushman ko intercept kar sakate
 Fighter jets like mig 29, Mirage 2000 of India have a provision for long-range fire-missile air-missiles, whereas Pakistan's fighter aircraft did not have this facility
 isse yah saaf he ki pakistani airforce bhartiya ladaaku vimaanon ko keval dogphite (aamane-saamne kii ladaai) main hi anges kar paati kyonki dushman jahaajon main choti duuri kii maarak kshamta vaali or america main bani sivinder missile hi lag paati thim
 Perhaps it was this growth that caused the government to prepare for the airstrikes, but the Indian government's decision not to carry on the Kargil war kept the plan a secret till now

 kaha jaataa he ki airforce ke is mishan main kai jokhim the
 It was likely that some of the jets would have been shot down, as the Pakistan Air Force had high-tech fighter F-16s waiting across the border
 pindi or kahuta main flying petroling jari thi, ye kisi bhi bhartiya air strike ko pakadaney ke liye taiyaar the
 Only the F-16s were not a threat
 bhartiya payalat is baat se waakif the ki france main bane crotel or china main bani echkue2bi, jameen se hawa main maarane vaali missile, kisi bhi bhartiya hamalwaar fiter ko nasht karne ke liye taiyaar thi
 Crotel has a range of about 10 kilometers and it would have increased at twice the speed of the Indian fighter fighter
 vahiin, china kii baniechakue2bi missile kam khatra nahin thi
 This missile has a capacity to carry 190 kg warheads which captures its target at a distance of 20 km
 yah missile 1150 meter prati second kii gati se bhartiya ladaaku jet kii ore badhati
 Upon reaching its target, the proximity fuse on this missile opens and it explodes strongly
 isse kisi bhi bhartiya ladaaku jet kaa batch paanaa mushkil hi tha
 The comments yadhyapi, kargil yuddh ke samay, bhartiya vayusena ke paas ek khaas tarah kii badhat thi
 India had a higher number of fighter aircraft than Pakistan and was equipped with much better weapons, allowing it to intercept the enemy
 bharat ke mig 29, miraj 2000 jaise ladaaku jet main lambii duuri kii maarak kshamta vaali air-missile lagane kaa praavdhaan he, jabaki pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan ke paas yah suvidha uplabdh nahin thi
 This makes it clear that the Pakistani Air Force could engage Indian fighter jets only in dogfight (face-to-face combat) as the enemy ships could carry short range firepower and us-made Cywinder missiles
 shaayad yahi vah badhat thi jisaki vajah se sarkaar ne hawaii hamale ke liye taiyaari kar lee thi, lekin bharat sarkaar dwaara kargil ladaai ko nahin badhaane ke nirnay ne is yojana ko abhi tak gupt hi rakhaa
 However, in July 1999, the Indian Army repulsed and won the enemy from all its posts in Kargil

 The Aam Aadmi Party has made major changes by re-launching its website

 saath hi party ne nile rang kii jhaadu vaala logo bhi lagaaya he
 At the same time, blue and white color has been used on the website page
 website par tamaam nae opshan or pej jode gaye hai
 The website has also been made more simple and attractive than before
 aam aadmi party 2016 main june maheene main donor list ke pej ko hataa liya tha
 Whenever the option of donor list was clicked, it would not be able to open the page stating the technical problem or message of the page 'under construction'
 iske baad party ne yah bhi kahana shuru kar diya ki website kii mentanence kaa kaam chal rahaa he, kuch samay main yah samasya thik ho jaaegi
 But the problem remained the same
 philhal technical khami kii baat karte hue website se list gaayab karne vaali party ne ab is opshan ko hi saaf kar diya he
 The party has made many changes in the website and has released many new information and detailed information about its tenure in the website, names and profiles of ministers, organization information etc
 donneton kaa opshan bhi rakhaa he, lekin donor list ko sire se gaayab kar diya gaya he
 The party has claimed on its donation page that it receives donations from 100 percent non-source and only 8 percent of the total donations have been taken in cash
 nausainik bahuuddeshy helicopter (enemarech) pariyojna ke maamle main bharat, china se peeche chal rahaa he
 The Indian Navy already has a shortage of surveillance helicopters to monitor its warships, frigates and aircraft carriers, while China has overtaken India in this matter and has recently developed its own indigenously developed multi-purpose helicopter Z-20
 Performed in Tianjin
 hind mahaasaagar ke ilaake main suraksha chunautiyon ke maddenzar nausainik bahuuddeshy helicopter yani eemrech bharat ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he or oktober main haal hi main china kii ore se jed-20 helicopter ke pradarshan ke baad to ye pariyojna or bhi jaruri ho gai he
 Defense experts say that the number of multi-purpose helicopters for the safety and surveillance of those ships is much lower than the speed at which the shipbuilding industry is providing warships today
 jab tak bahuuddeshy helicopteron ke rup main in saamudraki poton ko hawaii suraksha nahin milti, tab tak in poton ko pandubbiyon ke hamalon se bachaana kaaphi mushkil he or ye aaj ke samay kii badi chunauti he
 The England-built Seeking chopper, which was inducted into the Indian Navy 40 years ago to face enemy warships and submarines, is now too old
 iske alaava in helicopteron main tab se koi sudhaar bhi nahin kiya gaya

 Experts believe that this shortage of AMRH should be addressed immediately, whether the government fulfills these from indigenous industries or by importing them

 nausena ke purv test payalat or ritred commander capi sanjeev kumaar ne bataaya ki haalanki pi8 ai vimaan apni shrenee ke ajey vimaan hai, lekin ye bahuuddeshy helicopteron kii jagah nahin le sakate
 Multipurpose helicopters are capable of encountering submarines and enemy warships from the deck of a warship at sea, capable of electronic intelligence, surveillance and quick strikes, and act as aerial hands of the maritime fleet
 bahuuddeshy helicopter, america pi8ai vimaan kaa kaam to karte hi hai, iske alaava wo samudr main sonar kii madad se pandubbiyon kaa pataa lagane main bhi sakasham hote hai

 In August 2017, the Indian Navy expressed its willingness to purchase 123 multi-purpose helicopters, but so far no deal has been reached in this matter
 america ke sicosrki aircraft corporation se 23 emech-60aar sihok helicopter kharidne ke bare main bhi baatcheet chal rahi he
 But on the condition of anonymity, a former naval officer said that 23 helicopters cannot meet the needs of the Indian Navy
 unhone bataaya ki faisla to ye hua tha ki ranneetik bhagidaari model ke tahat bharat main 123 enemarech viksit kiye jaaenge, lekin agar aayaat nahin kiya janaa he to ranneetik bhagidaar yani helicopter nirmaataa company kii pahchaan kar lee jaani chahie

 baad main chaparasi se lekar clerk tak ne us memorondom par dastakhat kiye ki main anushaasan todta hum or vyavhaar thik nahin he
 The university formed a three-member committee to investigate this, all of which were from the regional center and one of them was a complainant
 meraa saamaajik bahishkaar bhi kiya gaya
 After the report of the committee, i was sent to Junir town of Mansa district, 250 km from Bathinda

 - ARUN KUMAR (@choudhriak) May 30, 2015 Arun Kumar Chaudhary's story does not stop here
 bataate hai ki anusuchit jati ayog ne jab register ko likhit notice bheja ki aap chaatro or teacher ke saath bhedbhaav karte hai, yah thik nahin he tab jaakar mujhe janvari farvari kii selary mili
 The Commission has now ceased to take interest, so i have not been given salary since March
 yahi nahin vishvavidhyalay ne arun kumaar choudhary ko notice bheja he ki aap kalege se gair haazir rahe hai
 Arun Kumar says that there is no process to attend the university
 maine class liya he or ab bhi jab imtahaan chal rahe hai to mujhe kaam saunpa gaya he
 Whenever i am on duty, i go to the center but there is no system of attendance
 arun tamaam aayogon or pramukhon se likhit shikaayat kar chuke hai
 The Scheduled Castes Commission had ordered SSP Patiala to investigate after talking to all the parties
 aaj tak us par koi karrwai nahin hui he
 "I have also made a written complaint to SSP Bhatinda that the Dean has threatened on phone that i withdraw my complaint from the Scheduled Commission
 "tippaniyan The university will definitely have its own side
 ham vishvavidhyalay kaa paksh bhi lene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 There can be two opinions on how much all things are and are not, but it is clear from many things in Arun's story that he has not only been insulted but also humiliated
 tamaam aayogon ke peeche bhaagate rahane ke baad bhi arun kumaar choudhary kii yatnaa kam nahin hui he
 This is all happening in a university
 kya vahaan kisi teacher ko hi pahal kar iskaa hal nahin dhundhna chahie tha
 The Commission should also investigate against the 35 people who have complained against Arun Kumar Choudhary
 us cameti kii report bhi nikaalani chahie jisane arun kumaar ko angrezi padhaane ke liye dhai sau kilometre dur bheja
 Someone has to come on Twitter and name their caste and say that help us, i am not being given a chair to sit, at least we all should be ashamed
 i have not given chair / table in Staff room bcse of my Chamar Caste,still facing discrimination in 21st century
 After all, Arun has not asked for the moon and stars
 maine bhi arun ke twit ko ri-twit kar diya
 So in response, many citizens have come to the answer that it is possible that they are not sure
 ve bhi arun kii is pidaa ke saajheedaar ban gaye
 There were some people who immediately started talking about opposition to reservation
 ye wo log hai jo arun kumaar choudhary ke saath ho rahe bartaav ko sahi tehra rahe the
 There was a phone conversation with Arun Kumar of Bathinda and according to him the story is like this
 punjabi vishvavidhyalay, patiala kaa bhatinda main ek riginal centre he
 There are 6 posts in the flame faculty
 sahaayak professor kaa ek pad anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he
 In 2011, it was first contracted
 jab bhi intervyuu hua arun ke alaava koi pahunchaa hi nahin lihaaza vishvavidhyalay ko unhen 2012 main bhi behaal karnaa padaa
 Arun Kumar Chaudhary kept on contracting despite having vacancy for the permanent post
 arun kumaar ne isi riginal centre se padhai bhi kii he
 When Arun Kumar Chaudhary started raising voice, the old teachers of the department started having problems with him
 ''teacheron ke kaam ke bantwaare ke liye hone vaali baithak main mujhe nahin bulaayaa jaataa tha
 i was given a different job than teaching that you should stay in the college till five in the evening after finishing class at 2 pm
 jabaki saare teacher ghar chale jate the

 The data of Google search regarding porn search in India is quite shocking
 bain ho yaa na ho lekin bhartiya shahar porn search karne main awwal hai
 According to the latest Google Trend data, India has six major cities worldwide
 desh kii rajdhani dilli main sabase zyada google par porn search kiya gaya
 It is followed by Pune, Mumbai, Howrah, Unnao, Kuala Lumpur and Bengaluru
 aankadon ke mutabik, logon nekamottejak chigensearch karne ke saath hi anya saamagree bhi search kii
 However sociologists absolutely refuse to link online activity to offline activities
 to internet par ye sab search kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Since 2008, people of Pune are ahead in searching 'animal porn'
 unke baad kramash: dilli, mumbai or bengalooru ke logon ne bhi ise khub search kiya
 While the people of Kolkata are at the forefront of searching rape videos
 iske baad haavda, dilli, ahmedabad or pune ke logon ne bhi is category main maujuudagi darj karai
 It has come as a surprise that Unnao, a small town in Uttar Pradesh, has the highest number of child porn searches

 kyonki china, rus or uttari korea jaise deshon mengooglaka istemaal nahin hota, agar hota bhi he to bahut kam
 Apart from this, people use different search engines in countries like America and Britain

 Technical stop mumbai main kai mafia don vajood main aae, lekin ek naam aisa bhi he jisane mumbai anderworld ko ek nai pahchaan di or glamer ko anderworld ke saath laakar khadaa kar diya
 That name was Bahubali mafia smuggler Haji Mastan
 jo mumbai kaa pehla anderworld don kahalaaya
 Who was Haji Mastanhaji Mastan Mirza was born on 1 March 1926 in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu
 uske pita haidar mirza ek garib kisaan the
 His family was financially weak
 kai baar ghar main khaane ke liye bhi paise nahin hote the
 The house was very difficult
 isi pareshaani main haidar nae kaam ke liye shahar janaa chaahate the
 But due to the trouble of the house, he could not leave the house
 1934 main mumbai aayaa mirza pariwarahaidar mirza ke ghar main halaat bahut kharaab the
 There was no cooking at home for two days
 tab haidar mirza ne aakhirkaar baahar jaakar paisa kamaane kaa man banaaya
 In 1934, he moved to Mumbai with his son Mastan Mirza
 vahaan unhone kai kaam kiye magar kamyaabi nahin mili
 He then opened a bicycle repair shop in Bengali Tola near Crawford Market
 dukaan khole kaaphi vakt biit chukaa tha lekin koi khaas kamai nahin ho rahi thi
 The 8-year-old Mastan, sitting vacant at the shop, used to watch the magnificent trains and luxurious buildings coming from the road
 vahiin se usne un gadiyon or bangalon ko apana banane kaa sapana sanjoya tha
 ALSO READ: Ten years had passed since he came to Mumbai to find the coolie on Bollywooddock still shaking this underworld don
 halaat abhi bhi pehle se behatar nahin the
 Meanwhile, Mastan met a man named Ghalib Sheikh in Mumbai
 use ek tejatarraar ladke kii zarurat thi
 He told Mastan that if he became a porter on the dock, he could easily bring out certain items in his clothes and bag
 jiske badale use paisa milegaa
 Mastan then started working as a porter in the dock in 1944
 vah man lagaakar kaam karne laga tha
 During this, Mastan began to befriend the people working at the dock there
 wo vahaan aane jane waalon se bhi dua salaam karne laga tha
 First step in the world of crime, in the forties, people from abroad used to bring electronic goods, expensive watches or gold, silver and jewelry
 unhen us saamaan par tex kii shakl main badi rakam adaa kerani padati thi
 This was the reason that smuggling on the dock was a profitable deal
 gaalib kii baat mastaan kii samaj main aa chuki thi
 He did not let this opportunity go by hand
 or gupachup tareeke se vah taskaron kii madad karne laga
 The smugglers used to bring gold biscuits and other items from abroad to Mastan and he would hide it in his clothes and bag and take it out of the dock
 kuli hone ke naate koi us par shaq bhi nahin karata tha
 In return for this work Mastan was getting good money
 padhenkidnaping king ke naam se mashhoor tha anderworld kaa ye dontskar ban gaya tha mastandock par kaam kaam karte karte mastaan kii jindagi behatar hone lagi thi
 He was benefiting greatly from helping the smugglers
 1950 kaa dashak mastaan mirza ke liye mil kaa pathar sabit hua
 In 1956, Sukur Narayan Bakhia, a notorious smuggler from Daman and Gujarat, came in contact with him
 donon ke bich dosti ho gai
 The two started working together
 us vakt sone ke biscuit, philips ke transistor or branded ghadiyon kii bahut maang thi
 But due to tax, it was very expensive to bring such goods to India
 lihaaja donon ne milakar dubai or aden is saamaan kii taskari shuru kii
 In which both were making a lot of profit
 donon kaa kaam badhata gaya or mastaan kii jindagi bhi ab badal chuki thi
 The little coolie Mastan had now become the brother of Bahubali Mafia Mastan
 jurm kaa duniya kaa bada namayun to pehle mumbai main varadarajan mudaliyaar urf wardha kaa naam chalata tha
 But he could not create a mafia don-like image
 kuch samay baad wardha waapas chennai chalaa gaya
 Now there was only one name in the world of Mumbai underworld, Mastan Bhai i
e
 Haji Mastan
 1970 kaa dashak aate-aate mastaan mumbai main apni alag paith bana chukaa tha
 He had achieved a big place in the ten-year-old Bhirt Mumbai
 samudra main uskaa raaj chalane laga tha
 Mastan had become more than he wanted to be
 ab wo amir bhi tha or taqatvar bhi
 He was very fond of wearing white designer suits and riding Mercedes
 uske haath main hameshaa videshi cigarette or cigar dikhaai dete the
 Aishoram had become the pastime of his life
 bollywood se tha lagaavamumbai anderworld ke raja kahe jane vaale haji mastaan mirza kaa bollywood se behad lagaav tha
 Old people in Mumbai state that Haji Mastan was a divana of Bollywood actress Madhubala
 vah usase shaadi karnaa chahta tha
 But this could not happen due to the situation
 phir madhubala jaisi dikhne vaali film abhinetri sona mastaan ko bha gai or usee ke saath mastaan ne shaadi kii
 Mastan invested in several films for Sona
 lekin unki filmein nahin chal saki
 It is said that Haji Mastan had friendships with Bollywood stars like Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Raj Kapoor, Dhamendra, Feroz Khan and Sanjeev Kumar
 kai badi bollywood hastiyaan aksar unke bangale par dikhaai detii thi
 Haji Mastan Mirza's name had become so big in the first arrest and in police Natmastakamubai that the police and the law did not matter to him
 1974 main jab police ne pehali baar haji mastaan ko giraftaar kiya to use ek viipi kii tarah tamaam suvidhaayen di gai thi
 He was kept under house arrest in a bungalow not kept in lockup
 khaane ke liye behtareen intjaam kiye gaye the
 For his sake, every need was taken care of which Mastan wanted
 police vaale bhi use salaam karte the
 Mastan was also used by policemen
 unhen mahange uphaar dena uski aadat main shaamil tha
 And if an officer did not listen to what he said, then he would get him transferred
 zarur padhensupari king ke naam se kukhyat tha mumbai kaa ye donindira gandhi ne bheja tha geldesh main apatkaal lagane se pehle kii baat he
 Prime Minister of the country Indira Gandhi also used to get news of Mastan
 mastaan ke badhate prabhaav se indira bhi pareshaan thim
 On his orders, the police tried to arrest Mastan Mirza at that time but he could not get caught
 lekin apatkaal lagane ke baad use giraftaar kar liya
 And this was the first time Haji Mastan had to go to jail
 bas yaheen se mastaan kii jindagi badalane vaali thi
 Mastan met JP in jail
 unke sampark main aane ke baad mastaan par khaasaa prabhaav padaa
 When Haji Mastan came out after 18 months in jail, his intentions had changed
 usne jurm kii duniya ko alavida kehane kaa man bana liya tha
 a large amount was offered to Indira a few days after going to jail during the Emergency, Haji Mastan offered the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi a large amount for her release
 lekin indira ne uske ofer ko thukraa diya tha
 When the Janata Party government was formed after the Emergency, about forty big smugglers, including Haji Mastan, were pardoned
 darasal, immergency lagane se pehle mastaan ne kai netaaon ko police se bachaane or bhaagane main madad kii thi
 Therefore, the Janata Party government had adopted a soft attitude towards it

 In 2016, when Ajit Pawar proposed to Uddhav Thackeray that, together with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress alliance, demolish the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena chief could not take any decision
 
 teen saal baad, aaj khud thakare bharat ke sabase amir rajya main 'kisi shivasainik ko mukhyamantri banane' kaa apana sapana puraa karne ke liye pavaar ke usee prastaav ko punerjeevit karne main jute hai
 On October 30, when Fadnavis claimed that his party had not even discussed any discussion with the Shiv Sena on dividing the post of chief minister for two-and-a-half years, Thackeray decided to quit the BJP
 aahat thakare ne maharashtra kii 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha ke parinaam ghoshit hone ke do saptaah se adhik samay ke baad 8 november ko mumbai main samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, ''pehali baar, kisi ne mujhe jhootha kaha he
 "BJP won 105 seats, Army 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats and no party has got majority
" uddhav ne daawa kiya ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne unke awaas par ek baithak main satta-saajhedaari ke formule par sahmati vyakt kii thi

 He called Congress President Sonia Gandhi for the first time and requested her support in a seven-minute conversation
 haalanki, congress-ensipi shivasena ko samarthan dene kii jaldi main nahin dikhti
 He did not submit his letter of support within the deadline of 11 November of the Governor, as a result of which President's rule was announced the next day
 thakare aas lagaae rahe jabaki pavaar 12 november ko mumbai main sonia gandhi ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel ke saath is baat par charchaa karte rahe ki kya ve shivasena ke saath koi samjhauta kar sakate hai
 Patel told reporters, "there is a need for clarity on many points before reaching a decision
" '' pavaar ne kaha, ''ham (congress-ensipi) pehle aapas main charchaa karenge or agar hamaare bich shivasena ke saath sarkaar banane par sahmati ban jaati he to phir ham unke saath (shivasena) aage charchaa karenge
 The term of President's rule is six months, we have enough time for discussion
 ''congress-ensipi ke rukh ne thakare ko bich adhar main chhod diya he
 In anticipation that the congress-ncp would be equally keen on keeping the BJP out of power, Thackeray looked forward to a quick response from them
 12 november ko thakare ne kaha, ''ham un binduon par charchaa karenge jis par ve spashtataa chaahate hai
 i also want clarity on many points from him
 ham saath baithenge or ek nunatam saajha kaarykram kaa masauda taiyaar karenge
 Political observers believe that the Shiv Sena's commitment to the Hindutva ideology is coming in the way of the alliance, although when Patel and Pawar were asked about it, they did not say anything
 congress ke ek sutara kaa kahana he ki party agar ensipi or shivasena ke saath sarkaar main shaamil hoti he to vah vidhansabha adhyaksh ke pad ke saath-saath 12 mantralayon kii maang bhi rakhegi
 The NCP also wants the post of Chief Minister for half term
 agar yah gathbandhan ho jaataa he to asal main, ensipi sabase zyada phaayde main rahegi
 This will give Pawar a chance to become part of the government and rebuild the party by ridding itself of internal strife

 iske saath hi, bhaajapa ne congress ke saath back-channel baatcheet ke dwaar khol die hai or usase kaha he ki vah rajya main shivasena kaa samarthan na kare
 The BJP leader said Patel had a meeting with Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on 6 November
 ve bataate hai, ''mujhe lagata he ki unhone madhya pradesh main rajnatik anischitata kii sambhaavna par charchaa kii he or kya congress ko shivasena kaa samarthan karnaa chahie, is par bhi baat hui he
 Former Shiv Sena CM and now BJP Rajya Sabha MP Narayan Rane says the congress-ncp is fooling Thackeray
 unhone 12 november ko kaha, ''meri party ne mujhe maharashtra main sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt sankhya (145) jutaney kaa kaam saunpa he
 i am busy at work and i am confident that i will do my job soon
 ''is sari siyaasi uthapatak main aakhirkaar sabase zyada nuksaan thakare ko ho saktaa he

 — digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)june 3, 2015 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Sunday that it would be unfair to say that his country has not taken adequate action in the Mumbai attack case
 kuraishi ne mumbai hamalon ke sutaradhaaron ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa vaada kiya or kaha ki aisa nahin hoga ki pakistan ko suraag die jaaen or vah sota rahe
 On India's questions on the speed of the trial against seven people in Pakistan in the Mumbai attack case, Qureshi said that the crime took place in another country and the process of information exchange is 'cumbersome', in view of these facts which 'complicates' Due to them, the trial slowed down
 pakistani videshmantri ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ko saath milakar kaam karnaa chahie taaki aatankwaadiyon tak yah sandesh pahunche ki ve donon deshon ke bich khai paidaa karne main kaamyaab nahin ho paaenge
 India's complaint that Pakistan did not do much to get those who attacked Mumbai behind bars, but Qureshi said it would be unfair to say
 kuraishi ne kaha, ‘hamaari gambhirtha par sawaal mat uthaaie
 We want to take action because terrorism is also attacking us
 ’ bharat kii shikaayat he ki pakistan mumbai hamalon ke sargana or jamaat ud daawa pramukh hafiz mohammad said evam anya faraar sutaradhaaron ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar rahaa he
 On attracting attention to this, Qureshi said, 'you feel this because we are not talking
 aapako aisa isliye lag rahaa he kyonki ham sampark main nahin hai
 Qureshi said that when both sides' sit, meet and talk, it will not look like this and the reality will be revealed
 jab hakeekat saamne aa jaaegi to ham ek duusare kii kathinaaiyon or chunautiyon ko samaj sakenge
 On India's warning of a serious setback to bilateral relations by the recurrence of a terrorist attack like Mumbai, Qureshi said that such statements are equivalent to giving terrorists a chance to dominate our agenda
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen lagata he ki aise bayaan dekar aap (bharat) un logon ke haathon main khel rahe hai jo hamaare sambandhon ko sudharta nahin dekhnaa chaahate hai
 As soon as you say so, the terrorists feel that they have taken up the agenda
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘khuda na kare ki bharat yaa pakistan main koi aatankwaadi ghatana ho, isse hamen saath milakar nipatna hoga
 Qureshi said that India and Pakistan should send a message to the terrorists that by creating a rift between the two countries they will not be allowed to fulfill their plans and the two countries will join hands to defeat the terrorists
 ’ kuraishi ne kaha ki pakistan sarkaar ne mumbai hamalaa kabhi nahin chaha tha or is ‘durbhagyapurna’ ghatana kii bhartsana kii he
 He emphasized that Pakistan will not allow its territory to be used against India or any other country
 bharat chahta he ki usne pakistan ko jo suraag muhaiyaa karaae hai, vah unke aadhaar par mumbai hamalon ke liye jimmedaar aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf pukhta jaanch padtaal kare
 Quoting India's concern over the slow progress of the case against seven people in connection with the Mumbai attacks in Pakistan, Qureshi said, "the pace is slow because the case is completely different because the crime has happened in one country
 The trial is going on in another country
" is
 ’jatiltaaon kaa hawala dete hue kuraishi ne kaha ki soochnaaon ke aadan pradaan main samay lagata he or puri prakriya bojhil evam vakt jaaya karne vaali he
 Describing the slow pace of the ongoing trial in connection with the Mumbai attacks in Pakistan, the External Affairs Minister said that even in India many cases are pending for years

 ) In the year 2018, the politics will be about the 2019 elections
 yah aam chunaav se pehle vaale har saal ke bare main sach he, par modi or shah chunki chunaav abhiyaan ke andaaj main hi jite hai, isliye aisa is saal or bhi zyada hone kii sambhaavna he
 Every policy of the central government will be read in the light of its electoral impact and consequences and every move of cultural war — self-proclaimed cowherd, Ayodhya, love jihad, homecoming — is the goal of converting the demographic majority of Hindus into a huge political faction and the Sangh Parivar declared Hindu This will be seen as an attempt to lay the electoral foundations of the nation
 is saal hone vaale aath vidhansabhaon ke chunaav apane aap main to ahm honge hi, saath hi ve 2019 kii badi agnipariksha ke raste main padane vaale padaavon kii tarah bhi honge
 Much depends on these elections; Not only the strength and strength of the general elections, but also the majority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Rajya Sabha, which it could not achieve most of its first term in power
 chunaavon ke liye taiyaar aath rajyon main se agar bhaajapa meghalaya, mizoram or karnataka jeet leti he or jin rajyon main pehle se hukumat main he vahaan apni satta barkaraar rakhti he, to vah apni hukumat vaale rajyon kii taadaad 22 tak badha legi or congress ko do rajyon—punjab or adane-se rajya puduccheri—tak samet degi
 If that happens (and it is not beyond the realm of possibility), Modi and Shah's goal of Congress-free India will be achieved within the bjp's first term
 to gujarat main congress ke behatar pradarshan or rahul gandhi ke punaruddhar kii afvaahon ke hote hue bhi 2018 vah saal he, jab party is lafj ke bilkul shabdic arth main vajood ke sankat se do-chaar he
 If she loses Karnataka, the only well-to-do state in South India, her earlier claims of being a national opposition will be further disenchanted in view of her political irrelevance in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 kai rajyon main apni vipakshi maujuudagi kaa daawa vah bhale hi ab bhi kar sake, par karnataka ko ganvaakar congress siyaasi taur par anaath us dumchalle kii tarah dikhaai dene lagegi, jo satta ke jeevandaayee khun kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main kumhalane ke liye abhishpt he
 In any one big and rich state, deprived of beneficial power, a national party is like a political orphan, because it does not have the opportunities to raise money from which it can fill its treasury
 congress ve jabardast saraparastiyaan to pehle hi ganvaa chuki he jo use centre main niyantran kii badaulat hasil thim, isko dekhte hue karnataka kii haar jaanaleva ho sakati he
 As far as political possibilities are concerned, Karnataka's clash is the most important election battle of 2018
 kehane kaa matlab yah nahin ki chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke chunaav kisi bhi akhil bhartiya party kii siyaasi niyati tay karne vaale hindibhashi suubon main congress ke bhavishya ke liye behad ahm nahin hai
 Nevertheless, it has to be accepted that without Karnataka, the Congress will neither have a fort nor an armory
 saal 2016 ke madhya tak media main vyapak sarvanumati thi ki siddharamaiya kii aguai vaali karnataka sarkaar gaddinshin party hone ke naate kaamkaaj ke apane beraunak or berukhe record ke boj ke neeche dabi hui he
 It is worth remembering that in 2013, when the Congress led by Siddaramaiah won the BJP, the BJP was in power in the state
 congress ne jin vajahon se vah chunaav jeeta tha, unamem ek yah thi ki bhaajapa kii vot hissedari yediurppa ke dalbadal kii vajah se gambhir rup se ghat gai thi
 Angered by the Chief Minister's removal from the position due to serious allegations of corruption, Yeddyurappa took revenge and formed a separate party, Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP), with a broken faction
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main kegepi ko mahaj aadha darjan siten hi milin, par vah 10 fisadi lokapriy voton par, jo anyathaa bhaajapa kii jholii main ja sakate the, kabja karne main or is tarah use vidhansabha main 40 siton tak sametane main kaamyaab rahi
 Yeddyurappa's return to the BJP should help the party increase its seats, but the Congress appears to be in better shape than a year ago to face this challenge
 iskaa kuch shrey mukhyamantri ko jarur diya janaa chahie
 Born in the sheep-foster Kuruba family, Siddaramaiah came late to the Congress politics and brought with him grassroots energy and OBC supporters in the party, which was sorely lacking at the time
 em
 Metropolitan leaders like Krishna led him
 sarkaar ne 2017 main bade paimaane par karj maafee ke jariye apane gramin samarthakon kaa saath diya he or uske krishi mantri krishna byre gauda ne raagi or bajra sareekhe anaajon kii kheti ko aakraamak dhang se badhaava diya he, khaskar jab sookhe or pani ke sankat ne dhan or ganne kii kheti ko avyaavhaarik bana diya tha
 Interestingly, Siddaramaiah has adapted the bjp's use of flags, national anthem and language for the sake of regional and sub-national affairs
 unhone rajya ke jhande ke haq main aawaaj uthaai, khud ko kannada ke suurama ke taur par dhaala or bangaluru metro stesan par hindi ke sanket chihnon ke istemaal ke khilaaf do took or nishanevaar virodh jataakar centre sarkaar ke haathon soobe ke upar hindi thope jane par hamalaa bolaa
 At the same time, another reality is that Karnataka remains among the top four Indian states receiving foreign direct investment and is the center of the country's IT industry
 in donon baton se milakar congress ko is behad ahm soobe main satta bachaae rakhane kaa nyaaysangat mauka milanaa chahie
 Initial surveys of media organizations like Visva Vani and Public TV, which do not invest exclusively in the Congress, show that Siddaramaiah can barely get a majority
 is paridrishy ke saath dikkat yah he ki isamen bhaajapa kii takat ko kai guna badha dene vaali shakhsiyat—narendra modi—kaa koi shumaar nahin he
 Siddaramaiah won the 2013 election mainly against Yeddyurappa and his corruption government against the BJP government
 2018 kaa chunaav ve ek aisi party ke khilaaf ladenge, jo bhadakaau laffaaji or siyaasi nautanki par anuthi maharath ke saath apane jabardast lokapriy pradhanmantri ke naam par chunaav ladegi
 This election will also be a challenge for Modi as well as his ability to convert his charisma into votes in the southern state
 ek baar pehle ve aisa karne main kaamyaab ho chuke hai, jab 2014 ke aam chunaavon main bhaajapa ne karnataka se loksabhaa kii zyaadaatar siten jeet lee thim
 Given the high stakes that have been raised, there is no doubt that he and his captain Amit Shah will leave no stone unturned to replicate that grand success
 har us cheez ke baavjood jo congress ke haq (bhaajapa kii rajya ikai main foot sahit) main he, karnataka ke chunaav ke bare main aatmavishvaas se koi bhi bhavishyavaanee nahin kii ja sakati, to isaki mukhya vajah yah he ki modi turup kaa patta hai, jinke bare main pehle se kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa, or ve apratyaashit tareeke se baaji palat sakate hai
 If both parties fall short of a majority and the key to power falls in the hands of Deve Gowda's Janata Dal (secular), few will be willing to contest against Amit Shah's ability to be a kingmaker by deceit
 
 gujarat chunaav ne dikhaaya tha ki satta main hone ke ghatate hue phaaydon ke pratikaar ke liye bhaajapa pradhanmantri ke karishme par or bhi zyada buree tarah nirbhar karne lagi he
 There is a market of speculation and rumors that general elections may be held later this year to coincide with state elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to be held on the same day
 iske peeche daleel yah he ki alag se karwaae gaye chunaavon main gaddinshin hone ke naate vasundhara raaje or shivaraj singh chaihaan ko jo nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he, uski bharpai modi ke josh se bharpoor chunavi reliyon se kii ja sakati he
 Rajasthan is an example of this
 vasundhara raaje ke maatahat yah suba dakshinpanthi aarthik nitiyon or swayambhu hindu gorakshavaad kii ek kism kii prayogshaala rahaa he
 Congress is yet to climb the mountain here; In the last assembly election, it was reduced to a pathetic 21 seats in the Rajasthan Assembly, but unpopular closure of schools, non-spending of budget money on social and community services and the arrogant and divisive Chief Minister have given a political opportunity in the hands of the opposition
 
 is saal jab saare pattey—yani sanghathan kii takat, rupye-paise ke sansaadhan jo centre main or bahut saare rajyon main sattadhari party hone kii badaulat hasil hote hai, siyaasi hawaaon ko apane haq main modeye kii pradhanmantri kii karishmai kshamta—bhaajapa ke haath main hai, aise main vipaksh ko, khaskar congress ko, safaaye se bachane ke liye jo bhi pattey uske haath main hai, acchhee tarah khilne honge
 If it fails, the bjp's already dull prospects in the next general election will come off as a bizarre
 bevajaah dashahat failaane vaala lagane kaa jokhim uthaate hue bhi bhaajapa ke liye achche chunavi saal ke siyaasi nateezon ko saamne rakhana munasib hoga
 If the BJP ends 2018 as the Gaddinshin party in 22 of the 29 states of India, it will be close to a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha
 uske baad agar vah 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaavon main apane 2014 ke pradarshan se bhi aage nikal jaati he, to yah samvidhan main sanshodhan ke liye jaruri vishesh bahumaton ke kareeb ho sakati he, nishchit taur par 2014 main kisi bhi siyaasi paryvekshak ke mumkin purvanumaan se kahin zyada kareeb the
 It is not very likely that the BJP will get a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha in 2019, but not having much chance does not mean that it is too untrustworthy
 zyada sambhaavna to 2014 main is baat kii bhi nahin thi ki paanch rajya sarkaron vaali party saadhe teen saal se bhi kam vakt ke bheetar 19 rajyon main sattarudh party ban jaaegi, lekin aisa ho gaya
 Both its supporters and enemies believe that the BJP and its ideological father, the RSS, are committed to re-create the Constitution of India literally
 jab karnataka se bhaajapa ke paanch baar ke saansad anant kumaar hegade ne elaan kiya ki ''ham yahaan samvidhan badalane ke liye hai'', to unki party ke inkaar or khud unke maafeename ke baavjood logon ne us par dhyaan diya
 By holding Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of India's most populous state, Narendra Modi has given notice that the political project of the BJP is to bring the elements of marginalization into the mainstream and which cannot be thought of, it will be common
 Have to talk about
 is dharna main koi chaunkaane vaali baat nahin honi chahie ki bhaajapa or uske sangi-saathi aupchaarik taur par ganraajya ko nae sire se gadhia chaahate hai; hindu raashtra kii pariyojna kaa vastutah yahi takaza he

 But rejecting his note, the cabinet note was moved forward
 unka yah decent note benchmark keemat ko lekar tha
 One class wanted to set a benchmark price of 500 million euros, but in this meeting the deal's final benchmark price was 820 million euros
 lekin jab iske aadhaar par vimaan kharidne ko manjuuri dete hue cabinet note ko aage badhaayaa gaya to iske virodh main ek afasar chuttee par chale gaye

 Former Team India manager Lalchand Rajput believes that Virat Kohli and his team play with an attitude to trample the opposing team and that will be enough for an unprecedented Test win in South Africa next month
 bharat teen test, chah vanade or teen tii-20 maichon kii siries ke liye south africa kaa daura karegaa, jisaki shuruyaat paanch janvari se hogi or captain ke rup main ise kohli kii ab tak kii sabase badi chunauti mana ja rahaa he
 Rajput, who was the head coach of the Afghanistan cricket team and now coaching Assam's Ranji team, has rated India's chances very strong
 rajput ne pitiai se kaha, bhartiya team jis tarah khel rahi he, ve kaaphi kadaa cricket khel rahe hai
 Ganguly said - Rahane's form for the tour of Africa is not a matter of concern, due to Virat Kohli being the captain, the kind of aggressive attitude he shows, it seems to have an effect on other players and they want to win at any cost
 
 ve virdohi ko dhwast kar dena chaahate hai
 On the prediction of the Test series in South Africa, Rajput said that 'india will win 2-1
 'bharat dakshin africa main ab tak koi test siries nahin jeet paaya he
 Rajput said, this is a team that can do wonders and i hope they will do very well in South Africa
 rajput ke anusaar bhartiya gendbaajon main dakshin africa ke 20 wicket chatakaane kii kshamta he, jo team ke paksh main nateeja laane ke liye anivaary he
 Rohit said - We have to maintain the same performance in foreign countries too
 He said, to win a Test match, we need to take 20 wickets
 hamaare paas aise gendbaaj hai, jo 20 dakshin africa wicket le sakate hai
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar is in top form, Umesh has done brilliantly, Mohammed Shami is bowling well after the injury
 unhone kaha, agar inhen wicket se thodi madad milti he, to ye gendbaaji kaaphi khatarnaak hai
 Rajput termed all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who was selected for the tour of South Africa, to be the change of match
 unhone kaha, agar aapako 20 wicket lene hai to aapke paas paanch gendbaaj hone chahie
 It can be three fast bowlers, an all-rounder and a spinner or two fast bowlers, an all-rounder and two spinners, it will depend on the pitch and conditions

 Our Union Home Minister P
 chindbaram bakhubi jaanate hai ki may, 2009 main hone vaale aam chunaavon kii vajah se unke paas uplabdhi ke naam par kuch kar dikhaane ke liye bahut kam samay bachaa he
 If they are able to do it, then it would be a coincidence
 vajah yah he ki mumbai hamalon ke baad bharat ko jis cheez kii jarurat he, vah he karrwai karne kii or vah bhi turant
 Chidambaram, who took charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs just a month ago, said in a meeting of Chief Ministers called on internal security on 6 January that his immediate priority is to increase the level of preparedness to deal with the terrorist threats that are becoming increasingly modern
 lekin unhen yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki kisi aatankwaadi khatre yaa hamale ke baad turant or nirnaayak karrwai karnaa bhi utana hi mahatvapurn he
 Both these steps are very important to re-infuse confidence in the country
 mumbai hamalon ke baad is aatmavishvaas ko jabardast dhakka laga tha
 But Chidambaram needs to review the functioning of his ministry more closely as he begins to implement the stricter agenda he has set for himself and his government
 aatank ke khilaaf ladaai ko agar vijay kii manzil tak le janaa he to kendriya grih mantralay ko bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 But in the last few years, the Ministry has been a perfect example of the disease that has been affecting the management of the internal security of the country
 mumbai hamalon se chah maheene pehle dilli, jaipur, bangaloru ahmedabad or guwahati main bam visphot hue, jinamein 215 log maare gaye or 1,000 ghayal hue
 After these attacks, as usual, many meetings were held for the sake of 'review of security', in which a series of charges and counter-allegations against one officer continued and no accountability was fixed
 iske saath hi rajyon ko ye rate-rataae nirdesh bhej die gaye ki ve apni suraksha kadi karen or iske baad yah jaanane kii jarurat nahin samajhi gai ki is maamle main kya pragati hui he
 After the Mumbai attacks, it was clear that the Home Ministry needed to revolutionize its approach
 is samay iske antargat kai maamle aate hai
 Apart from internal security and terrorism, its operations include rebellion in Jammu and Kashmir and the north-eastern states, Left Wing Extremism, Border Management, Immigration, Foreign Money, center-state Relations, Union Territories, Indian Police Service (IPS) and Central Paramilitary Management of forces, police modernization and policy planning are included
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki pichley kuch varshon main yah mantralay is kadar vishalkay ban gaya he, jise sambhaal paanaa mushkil ho gaya he
 The result is that it has kept up important suggestions like modernization of police, it has not been able to take any step towards resolving the battle of the jurisdiction of the intelligence agencies at the Center nor at the State level
 iske alaava vah aatankwaad virdohi koi kargar niti taiyaar karne main bhi naakaam rahaa
 After 9 / 11, the George Bush administration in the US decided that it needed an important Homeland Security Department, which, in the opinion of the US President, would "make America more secure because our nation would have a department that was intended to be the American Homeland Have to protect
 '' bush ne faisla kiya ki america kii seemaa, parivahan kshetra, bandargahon or mahatvapurn sthalon ko surakshit rakhane ke liye sirf ek vibhaag hoga
 Apart from this, it will have the task of gathering and analyzing the country's intelligence security information obtained from various sources, training the aspirants and armed them and managing the emergency at the federal level
 jaahir he, america kii apane desh kii suraksha samiksha se bharat bhi bahut kuch sikh saktaa he
 Given the fact that India has a tendency to create more bureaucratic hurdles, the solution to the problem is probably to separate internal security from other functions of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 america kaa homeland security department police aadhuniki-karan, vastuon kii prapti or anya karypalak kaam nahin karata
 Therefore, if a full-time cabinet minister for internal security is made in India too, it will probably help in solving the problem
 iskaa grih mantralay se kisi prakaar kaa sambandh nahin hoga
 Just a few days after assuming the chair of the Home Ministry, Chidambaram started the process of setting up a National Investigative Agency
 yah agency desh bhar main aatankwaadi maamalon kii padtaal karegi, grih mantri ne multi-agency centre (mike) ko punah sakriy kar or use javabdeh banaakar khufia agenciyon ke bich jaankaree kaa saz karnaa or behatar samanvayan sthapit karnaa bhi pakkaa kiya
 To stop the terror, now the emphasis is on greater coordination and exchange of information between intelligence agencies
 chidambaram ne laal-fitaashahee ko darkinar karte hue ardh sainik balon ke liye arase se lambit or behad jaruri upkaran bulatopruf jacket or riflein mangane kii bhi manjuuri di he
 Surely these steps will make a lot of difference
 lekin grih mantralay main buniyadi dhanchaagat or carmik badlaav laana bhi utana hi jaruri he
 And change can begin with people sitting on top of it
 mantralay main aath vishesh or atirikt sachivon tathaa 20 sanyukt sachivon main se sirf do hi peshewar rup se police adhikari hai
 Starting with Secretary Madhukar Gupta, IAS officers are sitting in almost all the important positions who have no experience in dealing with security issues
 kashmir, uttar-purv, naksalwadiyon or seemaa prabandhan sareekhe mahatvapurn maamle sanbhaalane vaale sabhi adhikari prashasnic seva se aae hai
 The program of modernization has suffered the most because most of the officers in charge of it lack knowledge and field experience in this matter
 is asantulan ko turant thik kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The Internal Security Department needs to be transformed into a body of experts capable of dealing with terrorism, rebellion and illegal infiltration along the border
 iske alaava, praathamikta vaale kai duusare mudde bhi hai, jinhen jaruri he ki grih mantralay dekhe
 At present, there is no such system that can identify illegal intruders and get them out of the country
 rashtriya suraksha main vruddhi, naagarik pahchaan ke prabandhan or i-prashasan kii suvidha ke uddeshy se san 2002 se desh ke vaid nagarikon ko bahupayogi rashtriya pahchaan patr (emenisi) jari karne ke prayaas shuru kiye gaye the
 5,000 crores then Rs

 Instead of passport, ration card or any other document, these cards should be considered as basic documents of identification
 sarkari sutron ke mutabik, yah pariyojna kai mantralayon ke adhikaar kshetra kii ladaai main ulajhakar rah gai he
 These ministries include Information and Technology, Ministry of Home Affairs and Election Commission
 ek nishchit samyavadhi main sabhi nagarikon ko emenisi jari kar die jane chahie
 Instead of ration card, passport, driving license or PAN card, this card should be a strong document to establish the identity of the citizen
 mumbai hamalon ke dauraan police or surakshakarmiyon kii javaabi karrwai main susti ekadam najar ai thi

 Provision of pichley paanch varsh main yah raashi badhkar kareeb-kareeb doguni ho gai he
 This money is available for easy movement of police personnel from one place to another, modern weapons, communication system, training, infrastructure, criminology laboratories, strengthening of intelligence branches, security equipments, construction of police station buildings and lower level policemen
 To be spent to build a residential building
 samasya yah he ki rajyon yaa phir kahen ki centre kii kisi tarah kii javabdehi nahin he
 There is no system to check this fact or see what the states are doing with that money
 grih mantralay ko apana vaarshik lekha-jokha karnaa chahie, jiske antargat varisht adhikari khud un rajyon main jaakar padtaal or nirikshan karen ki rajya aadhunikeekaran ke liye die gaye paise kaa kis tarah upyog kar rahe hai
 This will also make the system of accountability at the level of various secretaries and joint secretaries in the ministry applicable
 jimmedaari tay karne kii dosharahit vyavastha lagu karne kii bhi jarurat he
 The reaction of various agencies and officials after the terrorist attacks on Mumbai was well-known - from IB to RAW and Navy and Coast Guard (coast Guard) started accusations of counter-accusation
 ab tak yah tay nahin ho paaya he ki kisase or kahaan par galati hui
 By now, accountability should have been determined and some people's necks should have been measured
 kaayade se to ek samaybaddh jaanch ayog gathit kar diya janaa chahie tha jo yah dekhtaa ki kahaan galati hui or hamalaa roka kyon nahin ja sakaa
 Apart from this, he should also have thought about what can be done to stop such attacks
 america main 9 / 11 ke baad aisa hi hua tha
 Not sparing anyone, the commission should take action against those officers who were found to be lax in performing their duty
 iske antargat ibi, ro, maharashtra police, nausena or coast guard samet sari agenciyaan aaengi
 Even the answer should be summoned from the politicians when needed
 jab tak kade kadam nahin uthaae jate, grih mantralay ek se duusare sankat main fansata rahegaa or bharat iskaa khamiyaja bhugatta rahegaa
 Work plancompanies and Police Department officers with significant experience in dealing with security and terrorism, including Home Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs

 On June 29 in Patna, Hardik Patel called for the unification of the state's most backward castes (ebcs) - Kurmi, Dhanuk and Kushwaha - at the "patel Awareness Conference"
 gujarat ke patidaar netaa hardik iske turant baad sidhe rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke netaa tejasvi yadav ke ghar pahunche jo ki in dinon ati pichhadaa votaron main send lagane ke liye jor-aajamaaish kar rahe hai
 Bihar has about 33 per cent of the voters belonging to the most backward classes who have got more than hundred castes
 rajya main kushvaha kii aabaadi kareeb paanch fisadi he or yah yadavon ke baad duusari sabase bada jati varg he
 Tejashwi is considering this class as very important in the upcoming Lok Sabha election strategy and is desperate to do it in his court
 do yuva netaaon, tejasvi or hardik ke ek saath aane ke sanket saaf hai
 In any case, the RJD wants to make a dent in the EBC vote bank, which till now has been Nitish Kumar's strong base
 rajd netaaon kaa kahana he ki kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha (rashtriya lok samta party ke adhyaksh or endie ke sahyogi jo 2019 ke liye siton kii saajheedaari ko lekar bhaajapa se kuch naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai) ko lubhaane kii koshishen ab tak kuch khaas rang nahin dikhaa pai hai, isliye ab tejasvi ne hardik kii ore rukh kiya he
 The Patels of Gujarat are considered equal to the Kurmis of Bihar and Nitish Kumar belongs to this caste
 isse jaahir he, nitish ke dhur aalochak tejasvi loksabhaa chunaavon main bihar main hardik kii bhoomika par gaur kar rahe hai
 Of the 40 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, 31 seats went to the NDA
 jad (you) kii do siton ko milakar philhal bihar main endie ke paas 33 siten hai
 In 2019, the BJP will have to face the anti-incumbency, as well as will be entangled with the seat sharing with Nitish
 nitish kumaar ne 2006 se panchayat chunaavon main 20 pratishat siten ati pichhadaa varg ke liye arakshit kar di thim
 Since then, he has a strong hold on this vote bank
 us ek faisle ne gramin bihar or panchayaton kii raajnneeti kii disha badalakar rakh di thi, jis par kabhi savarnon or dabang pichhadi jatiyon kaa hi varchasv hua karata tha
 As a result, the backward castes, by forgetting their mutual differences, openly supported Nitish and ensured Nitish's victory in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and 2010 and 2015 assembly elections
 agar lalu prasad yadav kaa swajaateey janaadhar (14 pratishat) or uske saath pradesh ke 16 fisadi musalamaanon kaa vot milakar bhi nitish ke rath ko nahin roak paaya tha, to uskaa ek bada kaaran yah tha ki ati pichde bhi ekajute hokar nitish ke saath date rahe or palade baraabar ho gaye
 Nitish may not have much influence in the Lok Sabha elections, but his presence is important
 isamen koi hairaani kii baat nahin ki tejasvi ke is bayaan ke baad ki nitish ke liye mahagathbandhan ke daravaaje hameshaa ke liye band ho chuke hai, congress ne turant is par lipapoti kii koshish shuru kar di
 a senior Congress leader says that every possibility of expansion of the grand alliance should be welcomed
 unhone kaha, "rahul gandhi or lalu yadav, donon hi paripakv hai

 It may be that the competition sounds very strange and easy to hear
 lekin aaj kii janareshan ke liye yah aasaan sabit nahin hogi
 Because it has a small twist
 maanon na maanon ji haa, aapako 90 minute tak kuch nahin karnaa, matlab kuch nahin karnaa
 During this time, you cannot use any electronic device, nor can you eat, sleep, laugh or talk to anyone
 kya aap is baat ko soch sakate hai 90 minute bina apane phone ke
 
 
 This competition was started from the year 2014

 - input IANS Vijay Patel of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh was a pharmacist in Shajapur Jail, 100 km northeast of Indore
 use pehle vyapam ke tahat hue dugdh sangh pariksha farjivade main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or baad main police consteble or naaptul bhartee pariksha main bhi aaropee banaaya gaya
 This was also one of the more than 1,700 arrests made in the Vyapam scam that surfaced in 2009, so he was sent to Bhopal jail
 inhen main se ek maamle main jamaanat milane par april 2015 main jail se reeha hone ke baad vah patni se milane kanker gaya, lekin vahaan ek hotel main uski laash mili
 The police is investigating the case in its own way, but Vijay's father Chhotalal Patel is quite dissatisfied with it
 unka kahana he, 'adaalat main gavaahi dene se pehle hi vijay kii hatya kar di gai
 He was about to reveal many big names
 ' apane daawey ke samarthan main ve kehete hai ki jail se chhootane ke baad vijay ko apane vakil se milanaa tha, lekin vakil se milane kii bajaae vah kanker kyon pahunch gaya? hotel main agar vah akelaa rukaa tha to usne chaar bed vaala suite kyon book karaayaa? ghatnasthal se vijay kaa mobile gaayab mila orpulicene ab tak uske mobile kii kol detail kyon nahin nikaalin?mehtab singh damor jab indore ke mgm medical college main padhgaye vaali 19 saal kii apni beti namrata kii maut kii kahani sunaate hai, to dard palkon kii koron se aansu banakar tapak aata he
 In January 2012, Namrata's body was found lying near the railway tracks in Ujjain in a rotten street
 police ne laash ko laavaaris maanakar dafna diya tha
 Later the relatives of the dead were handed over to the dead bodies
 police kaa kahana he ki namrata ne train se kudakar aatmahatya kii thi
 But this argument becomes doubtful for two reasons
 ek-indore krime branch ko vyapam ke ek sargana dow
 a CD of Jagdish Sagar was found
 is sidi main darj dow
 Sagar and Namrata's conversation suggests that Namrata in the PMT 2010 passed Dr
 sagar ke giroh kaa sahaara liya tha lekin medical admician hone ke baad bhi dow
 Did not give full money to Sagar
 yani maut se pehle namrata vyapam ke thekedaaron ke dabaav main thi
 Secondly, his father Damore asks if anyone sits on the train after making a reservation to commit suicide? They have also petitioned the Chief Minister and the Governor to investigate the matter, but nothing came to their hand
 vaise rajyapal ramanaresh yadav bhi kya karen, ve to khud vyapam ke bhuktabhogi bhi hai or daagi bhi
 In February 2015, fraud reports were filed in the Vyapam scam against the governor and his son Shailesh Yadav
 shailesh se poochtacha ho paati isse pehle hi lakhanu ke maal avenue aria main yadav parivaar ke bangale main shailesh kii laash mili
 Despite being considered suspicious of death in the post mortem report, the family does not want any further investigation into the matter
 ab tak kaa sabase khatarnakaghotaline teenon maut ke alaava 28 june ko gwalior ke birla aspataal main dow
 The deaths of Rajendra Arya and Narendra Singh Tomar in Indore jail raised the figure of Vyapam's suspected deaths to 25
 haalanki vipakshi congress is aankade ko 50 ke kareeb bataa rahi he
 With such a large number of suspicious deaths, Vyapam scam has become the most dangerous scam of recent years

 In most deaths, family members are anticipating some or the other conspiracy, so the authorities are ignoring these claims
 lekin agar shailesh yadav kaa hi maamla len to agast 2013 se maamle kii jaanch kar rahe special task force (estf) ke sutara bataate hai ki shailesh rajbhavan se farji niyuktiyon kaa dhandha chalaa rahe the or is kaam main usne apane pita kaa letterhed bhi istemaal kiya
 In general, the family demands a thorough investigation into the suspected death, but the family remains silent here
 yahi nahin, narendra modi sarkaar banane ke baad jahaan manmohan singh sarkaar main tainaat kiye gaye zyaadaatar rajyapal hataa die gaye vahiin, daagi hone ke baavjood yadav ko pad se nahin hataaya gaya
 The other interesting thing, or rather, is the fact that all the people killed in Vyapam are small fish

 P
 shukla, rajyapal ke purv oesady dhanraj yadav, kathith taur par mukhyamantri ke kareebi kahe jane vaale khanan kaarobaari sudhir sharma, vyapam ke sutaradhar jagadish sagar, nitin mohendra or pankaj trivedi jail main khamoshi se pade hai
 For the Congress, all this illusion means directly - clean the small fish so that the investigation team has nothing left to gather evidence against the big accused
 yahaan yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki bade aropiyon ke khilaaf adaalat main sunwaayee abhi shuru nahin hui he
 In this case, by the time the trial starts, a lot of evidence will have been erased
 july 2009 main hi is maamle ko madhya pradesh vidhansabha main uthaane vaale tatkaaleen nirdaleey vidhayak paras sakalechaa ne india today ko bataaya, ''ab tak sirf do tarah ke logon kii baat ho rahi he— ek ve jo maare gaye hai or duusare ve jo aaropee hai

 However, even before these two deaths, the SIT had said in a report sent to the Madhya Pradesh High Court, "STF officers involved in the investigation of the case have also threatened their security
 ” hycourt ko bheji apni report main esaity ne kaha he ki in mauton ke peeche koi suniyojit shadyantr ke alaava jaanch ko prabhavit karnaa bhi ek vajah ho sakati he

 After some big arrests in Vyapam and its frequent Gwalior connection, the government deployed the constable on 5 August 2014 for their protection
 lekin in 10 maheene main unke 70 guard badale ja chuke hai
 Chaturvedi says, "many guards say that brother, if there is any problem, tell me on the phone, i will come

 Most state governments are upset by the Supreme Court ban on the sale of liquor on the highway
 court kaa aadesh tha ki hive va uske aas-paas ke 500 meter ilaake main sharaab kii bikri nahin honi chahie, or sabhi sharaab kii dukaane band honi chahie
 But now most of the state governments have started searching for its solution
 isko lekar rajya sarkaron, restaraan maalikon or sharaab kii bikri karne waalon ne faisle kii kaat nikaal lee he
 Highways withdrawn from the highways: The highways of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh have been denotified till now, and other state governments may soon do so
 aisa karne se in rajmargon ke paas hivein kaa darja nahin rahegaa, or yah sabhi supreme court ke aadesh ke antargat nahin aa paaegein
 Which will not cause any trouble to the liquor shops
 maharashtra, bengal bhi aisa karne kii taiyaari menin rajyon ke alaava maharashtra kibijepi-shivasena sarkaarabhi jald hi aisa kar sakati he, to vahiin pashchim bengal kii mamata banerjee sarkaar bhi isko lekar yojana banane main juty he
 There are many places in Uttar Pradesh where liquor shops have been shifted more than 500 meters from the highway
 upi sarkaar ke dwaara 31 march ko jari kiye gayi aadesh main state hive ke bipaason ko ab jila maarg ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 Bar and restaurant people have also set up jugaad Along with the state governments, bars and restaurants in this area have also started putting up many jugaad
 hive ke paas vaale baar-restaraan apana entry get hi badal rahe hai, jisase vah 500 meter kii duuri ke baahar aa jaaenge
 Now the municipalities will handle the roads
 After the state governments have made all the state routes into district roads, now their responsibility will fall on the municipalities of the city
 chunki pehle ye sabhi rajmarg sidhaa rajya sarkaar ke antargat aate the, lekin ab yahnagarapalikaonke antargat hi aaenge
 It is a question of money that the state governments get the highest tax through alcohol
 yahi kaaran he ki adhiktar rajya sarkarein is jugad main lagi hai ki kisi tarah sharaab kii bikri ko bachaaya ja sake
 So that there is no impact on the revenue of the state

 Also targeting Jaitley, Abdullah visited the state recently and asked the BJP leader and Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley through a tweet on the airport itself whether the Home Minister during the Gujarat riots Was resigned
 abdullah ne likhaa ki kya jetali sansad ko yah bataaenge ki gujarat ke dangon ke dauraan vahaan ke mantriyon ne istife kii baat bhi kahi ho, ise dena to dur kii baat
 The retired High Court judge will inquire Jammu Chief Minister said that the state government has decided to order a judicial inquiry to investigate the violence and subsequent activities in Kishtwar within a set time period
 umr ke mutabik is jaanch ko hai court ke ritred jaj head karenge or jo bhi tathy saamne aaenge, unhen janata ke saath saajha kiya jayega
 He wrote on Twitter that it is unfortunate that three people died in this violence
 isamen ek hindu he or do muslim
 i ordered a judicial inquiry
 mantri ne istipha diya
 But will the BJP recall its reaction to the 2002 riots

 Resort politics has become a common feature in Indian politics
 kabhi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne sarkaar bachaane or sarkaar banane ke liye is formule kaa istemaal kiya tha, lekin badali hui paristhitiyon main dari hui congress ke liye bhi yah ranneeti majaburi ho gai he
 Before the Rajya Sabha elections, the Congress, which is crumbling in Gujarat, has brought its mlas to a resort in Palanpur on the border of Rajasthan
 rajasthan-gujarat border par balaram pales resort main congress ke vidhayak bas main bharkar ahmedabad se laae gaye hai
 Elections are to be held on Friday for 2 Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat
 isse do din pehle hi raat ko kareeb 10 baje pales main gujarat congress ke 65 vidhayak laakar band kar die gaye
 This is the first time that the Congress is realizing that it has lost both seats due to the bjp's move
 phir bhi vidhayakon ko laakar resort main band kar diya he
 In fact, 5 of the 76 mlas of Gujarat Congress have joined BJP
 ab 71 bache hai, congress is baat ko samaj rahi he ki bijepi or sendhamari karne main lagi he lihaaja congress kii kirakiri karne ke liye rajyasabha chunaavon main cross voting karvaa sakati he
 Congress mlas are also understanding that they cannot win

 Congress MLA Niranjan Patel said, "if you don't win, you will have to fight
" vahiin pehali baar vidhayak bane imran khadvaala ne kaha, pehali baar vidhayak bana hum, isliye yahaan prashikshan ke liye aayaa hum ki rajyasabha main vot kaise daalana he
 At the same time, a woman MLA said that there was not enough courage in the BJP to break us

 England is to host the World Cup 2019
 richards ne kaha, ‘england acha khel rahaa he
 But at the last moment they fall behind
 unki team hameshaa se acchhee rahi he
 On the other hand, India and Pakistan are the two teams that can beat anyone
 sar viv richards ke bindaas bol, 'mujhe viraat kohli kaa aakraamak andaaj pasand he'unhone australia ko bhi majboot team bataate hue use khitaab jeetne kaa daavedaar mana
 Viv Richards said that Australia is a great team
 isliye mujhe lagata he ki ye chaar se paanch timen hai jinamein 2019 worldcup cap jeetne kii kshamta he
 When asked about the West Indies, Richards said the team had not shown its best form in recent years and hoped that the team would once again rise to the top
 australia ke is ballebaaj ne todaa mahaan viv richards ke 33 saal purana record Before the World Cup every cricket lover had suggestions for Umesh Yadav
 kuch cricket jaankaron kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki is khilaadi ke chayan par team india management ko gambhirtha se sochna chahie
 But Dhoni showed confidence in this bowler and Umesh Yadav also won him in the semi-finals
 centuri jad smith ne bharatiyon ko kiya sannasemifinal mukaable main umesh yadav ne 9 over main 72 ran kharchakar 4 wicket jatke
 Even though he lagged behind in the economy rate, he returned the Indian team to the match by taking wickets on important occasions

 He made David Warner his victim
 iske baad australia ke liye duusare wicket ke liye smith or finch kii 182 ranon kii saajhedaari ko todaa
 He followed Smith to 105 runs
 umesh yadav ne aron finch or james foconor ko bhi pavilion lautaaya
 If Umesh Yadav did not bowl well then Australia would have scored a score of 350

 The movie Jigariah released today is a love story
 
 
 yah kahani he, agra main rah rahe ek yuva chaatr shamlaal urf shaamu kii, jo padhai-likhaai main fail he or shaayari karne kaa shaukeen he
 
 
 His family career has been confectionary for years, but he wants to become a writer
 
 
 ek din achaanak vah takaraata he, ek ladki se, jisase use pyaar ho jaataa he, or phir shuru hoti he, ishk kii bekaraari, romance, shaadi ke liye bade-chote ke bich kaa fark, or phir tragedy
 
 
 Actually, the film 'jigariya' is an innocent-love story, with very beautiful scenes, beautiful photography, and most importantly, the film depicts the beauty of the country
 
 
 film dekhte samay mujhe kai jagah 'ranjhna' kii yaad ai
 
 
 Though the story of the two films are very different, but the way the film had a small family boy and falls behind the girl, the film tried to show the story of the boy from Agra in the same way
 is
 'jigariyaa' kaa sangeet bhi 'ranjhna' se miltaa-julata he, or film vaisaa hi junun bhi he, pyaar ke liye
 
 
 But 'moments' like 'ranjhana' are not in 'jigariah'
 
 
 dekhakar sirf aisa mahasoos hua, jaise ek alag kahani chunakar nai 'ranjhna' banane kii koshish kii gai ho
 
 
 Though 'jigariya' shows a innocence in the lovestory, the film is somewhat slow
 
 
 raaj purohit kaa nirdesan bhi thik he, lekin kahani kuch bhatakati hui nazar aati he
 
 
 While Sharee Mardia plays the role of an innocent girl in the film, Harshvardhan Dev is a bit unfit in the role of Shamu, or rather, it is revealed that the cast is new, and the lack of experience is clearly visible on the screen
 
 
 kul milakar 'jigariyaa' ek pyaari-si lavastory he, jo ek baar phir bharat ke anek rangon main se ek agra-mathura ke ishk ke rang ko darshaati he
 
 
 This film can be seen once, and my rating for this film is - 3 stars
 
 
 tivi sho 'saath nibhaana saathiya' main gopi kii museebataan kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Gaura once again played the stakes and kidnapped Gopi and her daughters and locked them in some unknown place
 ye khabar jaanane ke baad puure modi parivaar kaa is afra tafari kaa maahaul he
 On the other hand, Ahem is angry at his son-in-law that Gaura's son Dharam but Dharam does not give his mother's hand this time and he tells the Modi family all the truth about his mother
 aane vaale episod main apane parivaar ko bachaate huzham modi kii ho maut ho jaegior isi episod main dharam kii pehali patni bhi maut ko gale laga lengi
 After this, the story will be carried forward by taking a leap of three four in the serial

 varisht vakil bivi acharya ab karnataka hai court ko sarkari vakil ke taur par madad karenge
 After the resentment of the Supreme Court, Bhavani Singh, who was the role of public prosecutor in this case, has been removed so far
 bivi acharya is maamle ke trial ke vaqt bhi sarkari vakil the
 Shortly after his appointment, Acharya submitted an 18-page written document to the High Court in which he has appealed to the court to dismiss the petition against Rahat for Jayalalithaa's trial court verdict
 taqariban 67 karod rupee ke aay se adhik sampatti ke 1996 ke is maamle main pichley saal bengalooru ke ek vishesh trial court ne jayalalita ko 4 saal kii jail or 100 karod rupee ke jurmaane kii sajaa di thi
 Jayalalithaa appealed to the Karnataka High Court against this decision
 tippaniyan During the hearing, Bhavani Singh started playing the role of a government lawyer and in this context he was also given appointment letter by the Tamil Nadu government
 chunki prosecuiting agency karnataka he aise main sarkari vakil kii niyukti isi rajya sarkaar kii taraf se honi chahie thi
 However, the appointment of Bhavani Singh was not questioned during the hearing by the Karnataka High Court
 diemke ne unki niyukti ko supreme court main chunoti di jiske baad court ne bhavani singh kii sarkari vakil ke taur par is maamle kii sunwaayee main bhagidaari ko avaidh tehraaya
 However, it was also clarified that due to this Jayalalithaa's appeal will not be heard again
 karnataka hai court ab kabhi bhi jayalalita kii apil par faisla suna sakati he jo philhal surakshit he
 BV Acharya was also a public prosecutor during the trial of this case
 niyukti ke foran baad acharya ne 18 pannon kaa ek likhit dastauez hai court ko saunpa jisamen unhone court se apil kii he ki rahat ke liye jayalalita kii trial court ke faisle ke khilaaf lagaai gayi yachika kaarij kar di jaye
 In a 1996 case of disproportionate assets worth about Rs 67 crore, Jayalalithaa was sentenced to 4 years in jail and a fine of Rs 100 crore by a special trial court in Bangalore last year
 is faisle ke khilaaf jayalalita ne karnataka hai court main apil kii thi
 The comments sunwaayee ke dauraan bhavani singh sarkari vakil kii bhoomika nibhaane lage or is sandarbh main unhen tamilnadu sarkaar ne niyukti patr bhi diya
 Since the prosecuting agency is Karnataka, the appointment of a government lawyer should have been done by this state government
 haalanki karnataka hai court kii taraf se sunwaayee ke dauraan bhavani singh kii niyukti par sawaal nahin uthaaye gaye
 The DMK chose his appointment in the Supreme Court, after which the court ruled Bhawani Singh's participation as a public prosecutor in the case illegal
 haalanki saath hi ye bhi saafe kiya ki is vajah se jayalalita kii apil par dubaara sunwaayee nahin hogi
 The Karnataka High Court can now pass judgment on Jayalalithaa's appeal, which is currently safe
 taqariban 67 karod rupee ke aay se adhik sampatti ke 1996 ke is maamle main pichley saal bengalooru ke ek vishesh trial court ne jayalalita ko 4 saal kii jail or 100 karod rupee ke jurmaane kii sajaa di thi

 uskaa parivaar deyari kaa karobaar bhi karata tha
 Maulana Masood Azhar was educated at Jamia Uloom Al Islamila in Karachi
 ajahar kaa sambandh harakat-ul ansaar se bhi rahaa he
 Azhar was first arrested in 1994
 usko srinagar main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Extremist leaders like Maulana Masood Azhar, Mushtaq Zargar and Sheikh Ahmed Omar Saeed, who were lodged in Indian jails after the Kandahar plane scandal, were sought and released

 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that BJP has not given ticket to any Muslim candidate in the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main mukhtaar abbaas nakvi or shahanvaj hossain ko party chhod di jaani chahie
 The attack on BJP by Rajasthan Chief Minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot is as fine as it is sharp
 siem gahalot kaa kahana he ki bijepi ne apane donon hi kaddavar muslim netaaon ko is loksabhaa chunaav main kahin se bhi tikat nahin diya he
 It has become clear that there is no place for the minorities in the Bharatiya Janata Party
 gahalot ne ye bhi kaha ki isse saaf samajha ja saktaa he ki bijepi musalamaanon se nafrat karti he
 Therefore, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain should resign and separate themselves from the BJP
 bijepi ai to chunaav ho jaaenge band
 
 
 Explain that while talking to journalists in Jaipur, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that the way the politics of hate is being done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if the BJP comes in any case in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then there will be elections in the country or not
 No one knows this thing
 ashok gahalot ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi jis tarah se saamaajik suraksha ke liye krantikari yojana nyaay lekar aae hai, use bijepi main hadakamp machaa hua he or ghabrahat main chaukeedaar jaise sho yojit kiye ja rahe hai
 The way attacks on Rahul Gandhi are being spoken, it is clear that Modi is afraid of Rahul Gandhi
 ‘congress mukt nahin, adwani-joshi mukt abhiyaan’mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bijepi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki modi chale the congress mukt bharat banane lekin ab adwani mukt, murali manohar joshi mukt abhiyaan main lage hue hai
 Senior BJP leaders are being sidelined one by one, which is very regrettable

 unhone kaha ki desh puraa 40 minute tak intjaar karata rahaa lekin uske baad khoda pahaad or nikali chuhia
 The Director of DRDO could also have talked about the press conference that Modi spoke

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Kashi for the first time on Monday after winning again from Varanasi
 kaashi vishwanath mandir main puja-archana ke baad pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay hastkala kendra main yojit samaaroh ko sambhodhit karte hue piem modi ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon or varanasi ke matadaataaon kaa aabhaar jataayaa
 After Modi's visit to Kashi, questions have arisen as to when will Congress President Rahul Gandhi go to greet his voters in the Parliamentary seat of Wayanad? He had contested from the seat
 amethi main rahul gandhi ko bijepi kii smriti irani ke haathon karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 However, Rahul managed to win by record votes from Wayanad seat in Kerala
 narendra modi ke varanasi seat se chunavi maidan main utarane se bijepi ko ek baar phir uttar pradesh or bihar donon rajyon main jabardast phayda mila
 While opposition parties in these two states tried their luck together, they could not stop Modi's victory chariot
 vahiin, rahul gandhi ke vynad seat se chunavi ran main utarane se congress ko kerala main iskaa phayda mila he
 Of the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala, Congress managed to win 15 and the Left parties got just 2 seats
 iske alaava baaki 3 siten congress kii sahyogi dalon ne jeet darj kii he
 While the Congress has suffered tremendous losses in the states of North India
 yahi nahin gujarat, rajasthan, dilli, haryana, himachal, uttarakhand aise rajya hai, jahaan congress khaataa bhi nahin khol saki
 Such questions arise that the people of Kerala, who saved the honor of the Congress and the Wayanad seat of the people, brought Rahul Gandhi to Parliament this time
 jabaki apni paramparaagat seat amethi main bijepi kii smriti irani se kareeb 50 hajaar maton se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa hai
 In this way, the voters of Wayanad have done tremendous voting for Rahul Gandhi, in such a situation, it is bound to show gratitude to Rahul Gandhi among the people there
 haalanki philhal rahul gandhi congress kii haar se dukhi hai or party adhyaksh kaa pad chhodane par ade hue hai
 Several state presidents of the Congress have offered his resignation
 congress kii karaari haar ke liye party main manthan kaa daur chal rahaa he
