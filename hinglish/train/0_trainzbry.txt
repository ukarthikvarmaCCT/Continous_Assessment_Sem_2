 Strict on the Chief Secretary of the Delhi government, the NGT said that when pollution increases, you issue an order to stop the construction
 is desh main ek tihaai log construction yaa majudri karke apana jivan yaapan karte hai
 The government should put all those existences in the pollution program
 engiti ne kaha ki bina logon ko jaagruk kiye is immergency halaat ko nahin badla ja saktaa
 This happens every year in Delhi

 What is Delhi government doing on pollution? On the rebuke of NGT, Delhi government said that we are taking all possible measures to stop pollution

 On the other hand, Sabita Mahato, wife of former Deputy Chief Minister Sudhir Mahato, who had died just two days earlier, had to become the victim of this political drama
 unhen pehle to JMM ne ummidavaar ghoshit kiya lekin party ne baad main gathbandhan kii bandishon ke kaaran RJD ummidavaar ko samarthan de diya

 iske baad nathavani ne aaraam se ajasu ke chah vidhayakon par dore daal kar bijepi ke 18 vidhayakon kii madad se jeet ke liye jaruri 24 ke jaadui aankade ko chhu liya he
 On the other hand, in the UPA also, the Congress first issued a minority card in the name of former Assembly Speaker Alamgir Alam, in response to which JMM announced the nomination of a widowed woman from the revolutionary family
 lekin jharkhand main RJD ke sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kii dhamkee ke aage kisi kii nahin chali or UPA ke saajha ummidavaar ke taur par RJD ke premchand gupta ne baaji apane naam kar lee

 The incident is from the 1980s
 muslim virdohi sampradayik hinsa se gusse main saiyad abdul kareem tunda mumbai ke paas bhiwandi kii masjidon main jaakar musalamaanon par hone vaale julm ke khilaaf takreeren karne laga
 People associated with the Islamic sect ahle-hadith reached there
 vah muslim yuvaaon ko jehad ke liye uksaane laga
 Two Delhi-based boys, Abdul Haq and Abdul Wahid, were enchanted by him and joined Tunda's campaign
 tunda aage chalakar lashkare taiyaba (eliti) ke liye bam banane vaala ek khatarnaak aatankwaadi ban gaya
 In the 1990s, his module exploded several bombs
 ab 72 varsh ke ho chuke tunda ko pichley saal nepal kii seemaa par pakadaa gaya tha
 There he was looking for some new boys for terrorist activities
 rangarut bhartee karne kii tunda kii muhim ke kareeb teen dashak baad pratibandhit sanghathan indian mujahidin (iem) ke sadsy sultan salphi ke liye ladakon ko bhartee karne kaa kaam ab apekshaakrit aasaan ho gaya he
 Salfi started a debate forum on Facebook with the pseudonym "moses", where topics such as Islam, jihad and the rule of Islam were discussed in depth
 usne is manch ke jariye jaipur main ejineering ke chaar chaatro se sampark kaayam kar liya
 Those students were aged between 18 and 22 years
 ve ladke, jo ab giraftaar ho chuke hai, islam ke bare main kuch sawaalon kaa jawaab chaah rahe the
 Moses talked to them about the condition of Muslims in India and encouraged them to take the path of violence
 musa ko jab yakeen ho gaya ki ve ladke jehad ke liye taiyaar hai to pakistan main iem ke gurgey riyaj bhatkal ne bharat main apane gut ke khaas sadsy tahseen akhtar se sampark karne ke liye paltock messanger par ek farji pahchaan kaa istemaal kiya or use jaipur ke ladakon se sampark karne ko kaha
 After this Akhtar trained him to prepare explosives
 tunda se lekar salphi or bhatkal tak ke aatankwaad kaa makasad ek hi he, lekin unke tareekon main baari badlaav aa chukaa he
 Today, geographical or political boundaries are no obstacle to finding and instigating new boys
 jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki ab aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ke liye ladakon kii talash main madrason yaa masjidon main jane kii jarurat nahin padati he
 Chatroom is being used on the internet instead
 chating ke jariye unhen dharm ke naam par bhadakaayaa jaataa he or unhen hinsa kaa rasta akhriyaar karne ke liye maansik rup se taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 In the words of security agencies, this is a new and dangerous world of "internet Jihad"
 in aatankwaadiyon kaa mishan bam bananaa, use manachaahi jagah par rakhana or phir chupake se chanpat ho janaa he
 Militants like IM co-founder Yasin Bhatkal have been wandering across the country for years adopting the same method and no one was even aware of them
 har aatankwaadi hamale ke saath unka hausala badhata gaya
 The easy way to recruit terrorists and use the Internet to recruit them into their groups is becoming a matter of concern around the world, as it is proving difficult for investigative agencies to deal with it legally
 abhi ek taaja maamle main bataaya ja rahaa he ki 18 bhartiya yuvak iraq main islamic state (ies) sanghathan main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Last year, an Indian youth from Singapore allegedly joined the rebels in Syria, while a person from Srinagar, who lives in Australia, reportedly fled to Syria
 jaanchakartaaon ne bharat main sabase pehle 2004-05 main internet ke istemaal kaa pataa lagaaya
 Initially, the medium was used for publicity and contact among its cadres, but in the last decade, terrorist organizations have started using it to recruit, promote and interact with boys
 intelligence beuro ke ek adhikari, jo apana naam jaahir nahin karnaa chaahate, kehete hai, ‘‘aatanki banane kii prakriya ke dauraan ladakon ko vyaktigat rup se maujuud to rahanaa padataa he, lekin internet sampark sthapit karne kaa kaam karata he
 Yasin Bhatkal's statement to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) confirms this
 ‘‘yaccin kahata he ki usne muslim ladakon ko uksaane ke liye un logon kii kahaniyaan sunaayi, jo pehle jehad main hissaa le chuke the
 He had downloaded the documents, which declared jihad as essential for every Muslim
 usne osama bin laden, al yajid, al jarakavi or avalki jaise muslim netaaon or ladaakon kii takareeron ko downlod kiya tha
 He showed these videos and documents to Muslim boys to motivate them to sacrifice their lives for the sake of Jihad
 ’’‘‘yaccin ne unhen visphotak or iidi (deshi bam) banane kaa tarika bhi sikhaaya
 For this, he downloaded many documents and videos from the Internet and saved them on his Samsung laptop
 ’’chaturaai bhari gatividhiyansuraksha agenciyon ne 7 sitambar, 2011 ko dilli hycourt ke baahar bam visphot ke baad sabase pehle iem par shaq jaahir kiya
 But when an e-mail claiming responsibility for the blast was investigated, investigators found 21-year-old Wasim Akram Malik, a medical student from Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir
 is maamle kii jaanch karne vaale enie ne malik ko ‘‘internet kaa behad shaukeen’’ or ‘‘bina agua ke jehad’’ main vishwaas rakhane vaala bataaya
 The blast, which killed 15 people and injured 79, was carried out to prevent the execution of Afzal Guru, who attacked Parliament
 wasim ne khud hi is kaam ko anjaam diya tha
 He had ordered explosives with the help of Huji terrorists Aamir Kamal and Chhota Hafeez

 vaise ab yah keval patrika na hokar ek puri kii puri sanstha ban chuki he, jisamen sex ke alaava or bhi bahut-kuch he

 'plabvoy' kii shuruyaat america ke chicago main 1953 main hui thi
 This magazine later became 'playboy Enterprises'
 ab yah har madhyam main logon kaa manoranjan karne ke liye uplabdh he- print, web, tivi, radio, club
 
 
 In many other ways
 duniyabar main iskaa samrajya he
 One of the most famous brands in the world, 'playboy', Hugh Hefner founded it with the help of some colleagues
 'plabvoy' duniyabar ke mashhoor brandon main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 Although it is an American magazine, its editions are printed in many countries and in many languages
 isaki lakhon copy dhadlle se chhapati or dhadadhad bikati he
 There is a lot of addition to sex in the magazine, too, to put the grace of decency
 'plabvoy' main kai nami-giraami upanyaaskaaron kii short story chap chuki he, jisamen arthor si
 Clark, Ian Fleming, Vladimir Nabokov, Margaret Atwood, etc
 kai cartooniston ne bhi apni pencil chalaakar iske phalne-phoolne main apana yogadan kiya he
 In addition to 'hot-hot' celebrities every month, in addition to the ongoing hot masala magazine, interviews are also published of other famous personalities
 inamen artist, jarnlist se lekar arthshaastri or rajanetaaon tak kii bebaak raay or raaj kaa fash hota he
 Even bigger identity than passport! Syllabies around the world are eager to get on the cover of 'playboy'
 british model keli bruke ne ek baar khulaasa kiya tha ki jab bhi unhen america jane ke dauraan jaanch adhikariyon dwaara roka jaataa he, to ve unhen 'plabvoy' patrika main chhapi apni tasviir dikhaa detii hai
 According to him, officers do not stop coming to America after seeing his picture on the cover
 psychology ke student rah chuke hai hefnar'plabvoy' patrika ke editor hug hefnar manovigyaan ke student rah chuke hai
 All-rounder Hefner chose Rabbit as the logo of 'playboy'
 hefnar ne ek intervyuu main is logo ke bare main khusaala kiya tha
 He said that rabbit is a creature seen in America by 'sex'
 unki najar main yah furtila he, chatur he, sharmila he or idhar-udhar kudane vaala sexi or hot he
 Hefner, of ambitious nature, once in a meditative state at the center of the universe, once said in triumphant posture, 'I am at the center of this world
 ’ shaayad unka ishaara sex kii ore rahaa hoga, jo puri duniya main vyaapt he or sristi ke centre main he
 'playboy' is art, not porn
 
 
 'plabvoy' ke uttaradhikari or hug hefnar ke sabase chote bete kupar kaa kahana he ki 'plabvoy' ek kala he porn nahin
 Cooper says it should not be called pornography
 ve kehete hai, ‘yadi koi yah tark detaa he ki 'plabvoy' pornography he, to use aise kisi bhi sangrahalay main nahin janaa chahie, jahaan ‘neude art’ dikhaae gaye hon
 The first issue of the magazine 'sathiyane', now released in December 1953, was printed

 Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, Moscow were very well received on that occasion
 ab yah patrika ‘sathiyaane’ ja rahi he

 aise main uchit samay par unke khilaaf karrwai kii gai
 Informing his decision, Parsekar did not stop to say that he had obtained the permission of the high command and senior leaders before taking a decision
 tippaniyan Rajya Sabha member from Shiv Sena Sanjay Raut has reacted to this saying that in the current situation an all-party alliance could be formed against the BJP in Goa

 ’sushamaa ne kaha ki vah pehle pradhanmantri hai jinhen apni chuppi par garv he
 Sushma referred to Singh's statement in which he quoted a lion of Urdu saying that 'silence is better than thousands of answers'
 sushamaa ne kaha ki aap bole to kaam bane, khamoshi galatchhemiyaan badhaati hai
 He further said that it is a question of not respecting your silence but maintaining your (own) reputation

 The Modi government can legislate on triple talaq in this winter session
 iske liye sakht sajaa kaa praavdhaan rakhaa jayega
 The government has sent a draft of the bill to the state governments for their opinion today
 saath hi kaha he ki is maamle main apni raay jald se jald centre sarkaar ko bhejein
 According to highly placed sources in the government, the government will introduce legislation in the winter session of Parliament to end three divorces
 sarkaar ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act’ naam se is vidheyak ko laaegi
 This law will only apply to three divorces (INSTANT TALAQ, ie divorce-e-biddat)
 is kanoon ke baad koi bhi muslim pati agar patni ko teen talaak degaa to wo gaiyr-kanoonee hoga
 Since then, three divorces given in any form, be it oral, written and in a message, would be illegal
 jo bhi tintalakadegaa, usko teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he
 That is, giving triple talaq would be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 If a woman is granted three divorces, the woman can demand maintenance and alimony from the magistrate for herself and her minor children
 kitna guzaara bhatta dena he, uskaa amount magistrate tay karegaa
 The woman can also request a magistrate for custody of her minor children
 piem narendra modi ne teen talaak par kanoon banane ke liye ek mantri samooh banaaya tha, jisamen rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, peepi choudhary or jitendra singh shaamil the
 Sources in the government say that the law made after the 1986 Shahbano case was for post-divorce whereas the new law seeks to prevent triple talaq and give justice to the oppressed women
 sutron kaa kahana he ye kanoon sansad se paarit hone ke baad astitv main aayega par sansad chaahe to ise retrospectiveli bhi lagu kar sakati he

 He would kill my brother, i was afraid of him

 vishwavikhyath yoga guruor ayangar skool of yoga ke sansthaapak bikees ayangar kaa buudhvaar subah yahaan nidhan ho gaya
 The 96-year-old Iyengar had been ill for some time and was admitted to a private hospital a week ago
 do din pehle unki haalat adhik kharaab hone par unhen jeevanarakshak pranali par rakhaa gaya tha
 He breathed his last at 3
15 am today
 padmavibhushan se sammanit ayangar ke parivaar main ek betaa or ek beti hai
 The great yoga guru was admitted to the hospital on August 12 due to severe trouble in breathing
 unka upachaar karne vaali doctor deepali mande ne yah jaankaree di
 He said, "he had been ill for almost three weeks but still did not want to be admitted to the hospital
" ayangar ko dil kii beemaari bhi thi
 His health deteriorated and he was put on dialysis after renal failure
 ’doctor ne bataaya, ‘antim samay main vah achet jaisi avasthaa main the
 He said, 'he was not even willing to eat anything
 ayangar ko vishwa ke agrani yoga guruon main se ek mana jaataa he or unhone yoga ke darshan par kai kitaaben bhi likhi thim jinamein lite aan yoga, lite aan pranayam or lite aan di yoga sutraj aaf patanjali shaamil hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has condoled the death of Iyengar
 unhone twitor par likhaa, ‘mujhe yogacharya bikees ayangar ke nidhan ke bare main jaanakar gaharaa dukh hua he or main puri duniya main unke anuyaayiyon ke prati apni samvednaa prakat karata hum
 The Prime Minister wrote, 'generations will remember Mr
 BKS Iyengar as one of the best gurus, scholars and loyal leaders who have brought yoga into the lives of many people all over the world
 yoga ke prakhyat pratipadak ayangar ne pracheen patanjali sutara ko prasaarit kiya
 He is credited with propagating Yoga in almost 60 countries
 vah yoga kaa sandesh lekar purv se pashchim tak gaye
 Through the Iyengar Institute of Yoga, Yogacharya, who remained active till his last days, has a large number of followers
 aadhunik rishi ke rup main vikhyath ayangar ne vibhinn deshon main apane santhaan kii 100 se adhik shakhaaen sthapit kin
 Iyengar, born in 1918 in Bellur, Karnataka, moved to Pune in Maharashtra in 1937 and started his own institute called Yogavidya in 1975 after spreading yoga, which later opened many branches in the country and abroad
 unhone samaajawaadee netaa jaiprakash narayan, prasiddh darshanik je krishnamurthi tathaa vishwa vikhyath vaayalin vadak yehudee menhuin ko bhi yoga sikhaaya
 Internationally renowned BKS Iyengar was awarded the Padma Shri in 1991, the Padma Bhushan in 2002 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2014
 baad main unhone yoga vidhaon par 14 kitaaben bhi likhin jinka 17 bhashaaon main anuwaad kiya gaya
 Due to his death, all the branches of Iyengar Yoga Institute in the city are closed today
 unka antim sanskaar aaj dopaher baad kiya jayega
 It should not have been like climbing a 'straight' climb
 ‘sidhi dhaal’ ke myne sahajata, paardarshita, sakshmata, samta or purvanumaan kii yogyata se he
 These are the characteristics of any good government policy and the Union Budget is no different in this case
 koi bhi bajet, khaskar kisi sarkaar kaa pehla bajet, sirf nitigat aujaar nahin hota or vastav main vitt mantri kaa us samay aashay bhi yahi tha jab unhone kaha ki 45 din kaa vakt isaki taiyaari ke liye kaaphi kam tha
 Especially because in terms of both Goods and Service Tax (GST) and spending, there is a need for a consultation with the states
 yah thik baat he, baavjood iske bajet kaa antim lakshya to bilkul spasht hona chahie—tex or kharch jaise buniyadi sarkari kaaryon ko aasaan bananaa
 Occasional budget speeches are also meant to indicate the government's broad intentions on reforms — that is, FDI, capital markets and banking and insurance sector reforms
 in maamalon main prastaavit udaarikaran main aap khot nahin nikaal sakate, sivaa is aapatti ke ki yah vruddhi kendrit hai
 After all, what is so special in the capital investment limit of 49 percent? Why do we need FIPB? After all, why should North Block decide whether there should be disinvestment in public sector undertakings? Do we need Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)? Transparency requires that arbitrary decisions be tightened
 yahi vajah he ki kaarobaar karne sambandhi sanketak aarthik samiksha main pratikul dikhaae gaye hai
 Any arbitrary decision also distorts the allocation of resources
 isiilie vah sakasham nahin ho paata
 However, if they are seen as small reforms, then they cannot be blamed
 zyada-se-zyada aap iske apwaadon ko ginava sakate hai, jaise manaregaa main sudhaar, sabsidi, bhoomi vidheyak, pratyaksh laabh hastantaran, sangh-rajya ke sambandh, balki kahin zyada naatakeey baat vinievesh kii he
 In terms of all this, the duration of 45 days must have been quite short
 sahajatabajet ke mul tatv tex or kharch hai
 Let's take the tax first
 koi bhi tex dhaancha sahaj hona chahie—chaahe vah pratyaksh ho yaa apratyaksh, taaki anupaalan kaa kharch or mukademebaaji kam ho saken
 Budget documents state that the ratio of tax to GDP is 10
 6 pratishat rahegaa
 This is the case with Central Tax alone
 agar aap isamen rajyon or sthaneey nikaayon ke tex ko jod den, to aankada 17 pratishat pahunch jayega or jidipi kaa 5 pratishat hissaa pratyaksh (nijee or corporate donon) or apratyaksh tex main riyaayat kii vajah se tex rajasav maafee main chalaa jayega
 Without reducing or removing these concessions, we cannot broaden the tax base, nor will we be able to reduce compliance costs
 uske upar diarect tex code (ditisi) ke praaroop ko dekhen to yah pehle se hi itnaa jatil he or jiesti to atka hi padaa he, jab tak ki iskaa vidheyak taiyaar nahin ho jaataa or rajya us par sahamat nahin ho jate
 The Finance Minister could also make announcements on the basis of investigation, appeal and refund; And it was not necessary to do this only in cases of big money
 is sambandh main report or siforishein maujuud thim, lihaaja 45 din kii avadhi kaaphi thi (vastav main pichhali taarikh se tex sanshodhan par aashwast karne vaala bayaan behatar hota)
 After all, what was the reason that did not announce any process of consultation with the states or did not issue any statement (through the Finance Commission) on compensation to be given in case of revenue loss from GST? Gaya? Efficiency taxes are more efficient than direct taxes and more equitable
 agar aap ek-ek tex ke bajtiy prastaavon ko dekhen, to aapako do alag sire pakad main aaenge—ek pratyaksh se paroksh kii ore jaataa hua sira or doosraa, jisamen donon kaa ghalmail he, jahaan kahin ek ko kataraa gaya he to kahin duusare ko pehle kii jagah laa diya gaya he
 Maybe you want to encourage some areas
 sawaal uthta he ki aap yah kaise jaan pate hai ki kin kshetron par bal dena he or kya aisa karne ke liye kar niti hi sabase badhibia tarika he? aakhir shiksha kii bajaae awasaiya kharch ko tarjeeh kyon di gai? aakhir prasaaran madhyam ke vigyapanon par hi sarvice tex kyon lagu ho, print madhyamon par kyon nahin? sakshmata or sugamawa kii disha main icchit ditisi or jiesti ke sahaj dhaanche kii purv shart ke taur par ham zyada maanakeekaran or talmail kii ummid kar rahe the
 The same thing is missing from the budget, due to which the predictability of the entire exercise of tax reform is questioned
 pratyaksh kar daron ko beshak nahin badla gaya he, lekin phir paroksh kar kii dar se chhedchhad kyon kii gai or 12 pratishat kii aadhaar dar ko kyon tyaag diya gaya? tex sudhaaron kii vaastavik niyat is ichhashakti se paidaa hoti he ki aap lobby ke chakkar main na aane paaen
 Once you have mobilized resources (tax and non-tax resources), the question remains only to give priority to spending
 samtayahin samta kaa tatv paidaa hota he or sansadhano kii maang ko lekar hameshaa hode kaayam rahati he
 Restoring growth was an important element in your agenda, but this is not possible through the budget alone
 iske liye yojana or puunji kharch kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 Due to the constraints of losses, you cannot compress them
 raksha kshetra ko chhodkar agar saamne baaki chizon ko rakhkar tulana kii jaae to ham pate hai ki puunji kharch vastav main badha hi nahin he jabaki aisa jaruri tha, kyonki kanoon vyavastha (police samet) buniyadi taur par sarkaar kaa kaam hota he
 Since we are referring to the Government of India, then the question becomes that on what should the government spend? Obviously, essentially on disadvantaged groups and geographical areas and BPL citizens
 kya bajtiy bhaashan sidhe-sidhe bipiel kii yathasambhav pahchaan or pratyaksh laabh hastantaran par kendrit nahin ho saktaa tha? aakhir bajet bhaashan ke pehle hisse main varnit tamaam kism kii yojanaon kaa kya matlab banataa he? sinchai, gramin vikaas, essi / asti, mahila or bal vikaas, peyajal or swatchta, swasthya, shiksha, ity, awasaiya vikaas, shaharikaran, emsamai, buniyadi dhaancha aadi tamaam kshetra baraabar ahm hai, sabhi ko sau-sau karod ru
 Allocating a nominal amount of Rs
 Is a matter of hunting everyone together with a single bullet, in which there is an expectation that something or the other will work
 in ghoshnaaon par bhale hi saansadon ne shaabaashi kii mej thapthapa di ho, lekin samta ke liye vaastavik prayaas karne or garibon ke naam par kuch bhi kar dene ke bich kaaphi bada fark hota he
 Had it not been so, the history of the last 67 years would have been completely different
 samta or purvanumaan kii kshamta donon ke hi hit main vitt mantri se meri apeksha thi ki ve hamaare upar nae-nae naam kii or zyada yojanaayen thopane kii bajaae kshetron ko chunate or unke prati paardarshee rahane kii baat kar pate, jo nahin ho sakaa
 Forecasting capability We have only the option of forecasting
 iskaa aashay daron or vittiya majbootee se he
 GST rates are still hanging in the balance and the direct tax ratio is broadly stable and predictable
 rajkoshiya majbootee hasil karne kii disha main 2014-15 ke liye rajkoshiya ghate or jidipi kii bataai gai 4
 Can we believe at a 1 percent ratio rate? i do not think so
 mujhe nahin lagata ki 13
 a minimum GDP growth rate of 4 percent will be achieved
 vaastavik vruddhi dar 5
 With 5 percent, inflation for this is 7
 5 fisadi hona padegaa
 It does not look possible
 aisa hi pichhali sarkaar ke saath bhi tha
 The quality of fiscal consolidation efforts will be questioned and the fiscal deficit and GDP ratio targets for 2015–16 and 2016–17
 6 or 3 pratishat ke aankade bhi andeh ke ghere main aa jaaenge
 If a more clear roadmap of 3-4 years had been made, then a better estimate could have been made
 45 din kii taiyaari main jis ‘chadhaai’ ko bajet ne tay kiya he, vah vitt mantri ke liye behad kathin or khadi chadhaai thi
 Maybe the Finance Minister will be able to do something better next year
 dilli ke ranjit nagar se police ne ek tantric ko giraftaar kiya he jo soshal media va just dial ke jariye logon ko apana shikaar bana thagi karata tha
 This Tantric thug, who lives in Meerut, has cheated millions of rupees by showing fear of ghosts and shadows from hundreds of people
 thag tantric apane shikaar se petm ke jariye or bank acount main paise transfar karaata tha
 The police laid a trap on the complaint of the victims of the thugs and arrested the tantric thugs red handed
 police ne giraftaar tantric thag kii pahchaan meerut ke rahane vaale salmaan ke rup main kii he, jo dilli ensiaar samet kai rajyon ke logon kolakhon kaa chuunaalaga chukaa he
 As a tantric, Salman had put his number on Just Dial and social site
 soshal media par usne kuch video clip daal rakhe the, jisamen vah vaseekaran, kaarobaar main nuksaan, bimaari se dukhi logon kii samasyaayein dur karne kaa daawa karata tha
 He used to send photos of ghosts from the Internet to the people trapped in his hoax, saying that there is a dark shadow of ghosts in his house and he will have to get shot for the exorcism or not even someone's death May be, in return for which he used to make big money
 tantric thag salmaan ne just dial va anya soshal saiton par nehru place, meerut or mawana ke farji pate registerd karaae the
 When he got a call from a person trapped in his hoard, he used to ask for Rs 4100 to 5100 rupees in his account by showing them the fear of black magic of ghosts
 salmaan ab tak dilli ensiaar ke alaava haryana, punjab, yupi or maharashtra sahit kai rajyon ke logon ko apana shikaar bana chukaa he
 But when people realized that they had been victims of fraud, they complained to the police
 police ne jab just dial par registerd uske pate ko khangala to vah farji niklaa
 After this, the police contacted Salman as a fake customer
 jab vah police ke jhaanse main aa gaya to use puraani dilli stesan par bulaayaa gaya, jahaan se police ne use giraftaar kar liya

 Finally, the Center has gone a step further to send IFS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi to the Delhi government
 kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ne swasthya mantralay se kaha he ki chaturvedi ko dilli sarkaar main bheje jane ke liye enosi de diya jaae
 Significantly, ever since becoming Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal has been seeking Chaturvedi for his OSD post, but Sanjeev Chaturvedi has not been relieved yet
 ames main sivio rah chuke chaturvedi vivaadon main rahe hai or unhone haal hi main hi adaalat main jaakar ye kaha tha ki unhen koi kaam nahin diya ja rahaa
 Chaturvedi is known for exposing several corruption cases at AIIMS and there was a huge controversy last year when he was removed as CVO of AIIMS
 is bich arvind kejariwal ye kehete rahe hai ki centre sarkaar jaan-boojhkar ek eemaandaar afasar ko dilli sarkaar main nahin bhej rahi
 The comments chaturvedi mulat: haryana kader ke afasar hai
 He has demanded to change his cadre to Uttarakhand, on which the Prime Minister has to decide
 khabar ye bhi he ki centre sarkaar par unhen waapas haryana bheje jane kaa dabaav bhi he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen what the Appointment Committee of Cabinet (ACC) headed by the Prime Minister decides
 gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri banane ke baad se hi arvind kejariwal chaturvedi ko apane oesady pad ke liye maang rahe hai, lekin sanjeev chaturvedi ko ab tak relive nahin kiya gaya he
 Chaturvedi, who was the CVO at AIIMS, has been in controversies and he recently went to court and said that he was not being given any work
 chaturvedi ames main kai bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko ujagar karne ke liye jane jate hai or pichley saal jab unhen ames ke sivio pad se hataaya gaya to bada vivaad hua tha
 Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal has been saying that the central government is not deliberately sending an honest officer to the Delhi government
 tippaniyan Chaturvedi is basically an officer of Haryana cadre
 unhone apana kader badalakar uttarakhand karne kii maang kii hui he, jis par faisla pradhanmantri ko lenaa he
 There is also news that there is pressure on the central government to send them back to Haryana
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata vaali appoinment cameti of cabinet (ACC) kya faisla leti he

 manoj tiwariyahin nahin ruke phir wo aam naagarik kii tarah metro main sawari kii or logon se iskaa feed back janaa
 Delhi BJP president traveled in metro from Central Secretariat to Kashmiri Gate
 manoj tiwari ne logon ko bataaya ki kaise wo rosemara kii choti-choti jaruraton ke liye cash par apni nirbharta kam kar sakate hai
 He also enumerated the advantages of paying by card
 manoj ne kaha ki cash kii killat ke daur main ek to noton kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Other expenses will also be systematic
 tiwari ne apane saath metro kaa safar kar rahe logon koi-woletki nai seva ke bare main bhi bataaya or samajhaayaa ki kaise aasaan tareekon se wo apane mobile ke jariye hi sabji vaale se lekar doodh or kiraanaa kaa saamaan kharid sakate hai

 Bollywood has been introduced in many films in a number of films, ranging from bringing home to Lord Ganesha with drums, worshiping him, immersion and telling him about his happiness and misery
 samayik vishyon par vruttchitr banane vaali lavalin thadani ne kaha, mumbai main ganeshotsav kii shuruyaat 1920 ke dashak main bal gangadhar tilak ne choupati kii ek gali se kii thi

 Film critic Anirudh Mishra said, "to get rid of any pain or suffering, the hero or heroine is shown doing Ganapati Puja

 haalanki filmon main is tarah ke drishyon kii khaas jarurat nahin hoti, lekin inhen hamaari samskruti ke pratik ke taur par rakhaa janaa galat bhi nahin he
 There are many films like 'hum Paanch', 'pratighath' and many more, showing the traditional Ganeshotsav with a contemporary perspective
 vighnaharta ko har shubh kaam se pehle yaad karne kaa chalan rahaa he or aisa mana jaataa he ki ganesh vandana se shuru hone vaale kaam aasaani se ban jate hai

 com / p5y4manaoc— Jawahar Yadav (@jawaharyadavbjp)february 13, 2016 Attacking the central government on the issue of Lokpal, social activist Anna Hazare said that not bringing Lokpal is a disrespect of public will
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi itnaa acha bhaashan dete hai, phir sawaal uthta he ki vah lokapal kyon nahin laa rahe?gauratlab he ki supreme court ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki saal 2013 kaa lokapal or lokayukta kanoon vyavhaarik he or iskaa kriyanvayan latakaakar rakhana nyaaysangat nahin he
 According to this law, the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha will be part of the Lokpal Selection Panel, but at present there is no Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha
 nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi or nyaayamurti naveen sinha kii peeth ne sheersh adaalat ke ek purv faisle kaa sandarbh dete hue kaha, hamaara kahana he ki yah vyavhaarik he or ise latakaakar rakhana nyaaysangat nahin he
 On March 28, the apex court reserved its verdict on petitions seeking the appointment of Lokpal in the country
 lokapal or lokayukta kanoon lagu karne main centre sarkaar jo der laga rahi he uski janhit yachika prashanth bhushan ne darj kii thi
 In the hearing of that PIL, the Supreme Court on Thursday reprimanded the Modi government
 is par anna hajaare ne kaha, ' is sarkaar ko pehle bhi ek baar fatkaar lagaai gai he ki lokapal kanoon ko jald se jald lagu karo
 This Jolokpal is not being taken, it is a disrespect to the public's desire by saying that the opposing party is not the leader
 narendra modi itnaa acha bhaashan dete he, phir bhi ye sarkaar lokapal kyon nahi laa rahi he, ye ek sawaal he
 "the lack of willpower with the government," said Anna Hazare, "I say that for the Public Commissioner, there is no need for an opposition party leader, every state has to appoint a Lokayukta
 agar CBI diarector bina virdohi paksh netaa hote hue bhi niyukt karte hai, cvc chif bina virdohi paksh netaa niyukt kar sakate hai, to lokapal kanoon kyon nahi ban saktaa
 This means that the government lacks willpower
 modi sarkaar ko ahankaar ho gaya he!anna ne modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha, 'aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki har jagah chunaav main jo lagaataar jeet ho rahi he, to unako ( modi sarkaar ) ahm paidaa ho gaya ho
 
 
 They would think that someone will spoil us
 sarvocch adaalat ke do-do baar bataane ke baavjood bhi nahi lagu kar rahe he lokapal, lokayukta kanoon, to iskaa matlab ye badhata hua igo he
 This is quite a government, but in consultation with my workers, i will do something against this government
 lokapal ko lagu nahi karnasanvidhan kii avmaananaahai, adaalat kii avmaananaa he, hamaare desh ke kanoon kii avmaananaa he
 The expectation of the public to bring Lokpal is contempt of that public as well
 duniya ke falak par germany ke taanashaah adolf hitler ke ubharne se pehle italy kaa taanashaah benito musolini apane desh kaa sabase lokapriy netaa tha
 He was so loved and respected by people that he came to be called 'the Leader'

 vah italy ke fasiwad kaa janak tha
 After the dictatorship, he wiped out his intelligence through the police
 uske baad aise kanoon banaae jisase ek dal kii taanaashaahee kaa rasta italy main prashast hua

 1943 tak aate-aate italy main yuddh ko lekar jansamarthan ghatane laga tha or musolini ke netritv par sawaal uthne lage the
 Therefore, in 1943 he was dismissed by the King of Italy and he was arrested
 haalanki baad main germany ne usko jail se reeha kara liya
 In 1945, when it became very clear that Germany was losing the Second World War, Mussolini tried to flee Switzerland and was caught on the road with his girlfriend
 unki hatya kar di gai or shav milan laayaa gaya
 a newspaper of that period claimed that their bodies were hanged at the crossroads for exhibition
 musolini virdohi partisan gut ke pramukh ne tab kaha bhi tha ki aisi ghatnaayen taanaashaahee ke khilaaf logon ke gusse ko darshaati he or yah galat nahin he

 wo 7 baaten jo chhipi rah gayi modi sarkaar ke bajet main, laaegi bada badlaavvitt mantri arun jetali ne modi sarkaar kaa aakhri purna bajet pesh kiya
 Farmers and villagers have definitely got relief from this budget
 vahiin, middle class or korporate ko niraashaa haath lagi he
 Amidst the big announcements of the government, some things of the budget remained hidden, which can bring big changes

 How the Modi government's 5 budget squeezed, from 2014 to 2018, the changed government's policy minister Arun Jaitley has presented the last full budget of the current central government
 agle saal loksabhaa chunaav hone hai or 2019 main antarim bajet hi pesh kiya jayega
 Therefore, the budget was focused on people from the common people to economists
 bajet 2018 se kai kshetron ko niraashaa haath lagi he to kai nai ghoshnaaen bhi kii gai hai
 In the year 2018, all such Bollywood films were released, which could earn more in a low budget, whereas big budget films did not get good response
 iske alaava bollywood ke khans shahrukh khan (shah Rukh Khan), salmaan khan (salman Khan) or aamir khan (aamir Khan) ne karodon kharch karke bade naam vaali filmein to relies kii, lekin jab vah parde par ain to darshakon ko niraash haath lagi
 This year was also great for low-budget films
 'stri' (stree), 'raji' (raazi), 'badhai ho' (badhaai Ho) jaisi kam bajet vaali filmon ne bade parde par nami stars ko peeche chhod diya
 Keeping all these in mind, web users were asked which film was a hit or flop in the year 2018
 iske alaava koun-sa actor yaa actress shandaar yaa phir flop rahaa
 The answer to which has been given below
 yugers ke mutabik sabase flop film 'thags of hindustaan'yugers ke mutabik sabase shandaar actor ayushmaan khuranayugers ke mutabik sabase flop actor harshavardhan kapoorugers ke mutabik sabase shandaar actress aalia bhattyugers ke mutabik sabase flop actress katrina caff BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Monday raised a controversial land deal involving Robert Vadra in Haryana, in a fierce attack on the Gandhi family
 modi ne jhajjar main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue rajya kii congress sarkaar ke saath centre sarkaar par bhi prahaar kiya
 He accused the Congress government of the state and the Center of taking the farmers lightly and selling their land at a much lower price
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne kaha, haryana main pita-putr kii jodi kaarobaar chalaa rahe hai jabaki dilli main mata-putr kii jodi yah kaam kar rahe hai
 If this does not work, now the son-in-law has come to the field
 modi ne kaha, kisaan ghabaraaye hue hai ki sarkaar unki jameen le rahi he or agenton ko kaaphi kam daam par bech rahi he
 Due to brother-in-law, farmers have to sell their land at the cost of bags
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne kaha haryana sarkaar kii bhoomi niti ke kaaran ek vyakti bina ek paise se teen maheene main 50 karod rupee kamata he
 Shahzade (rahul Gandhi) What kind of policy is this, through which you gave land to your brother-in-law
 bhoomi saude ke mudde par gandhi parivaar par chutki lete hue modi ne logon se poocha ki kya koi yahaan par he jo bina ek paisa nivesh kiye hue hi teen maheene main 50 karod rupee kama saktaa he? unhone sawaal kiya, yahaan koi jaadugar he jo aisi kala jaanata ho? aisi kala sirf shahjade ke parivaar ko hi pataa he
 Targeting Rahul Gandhi for anger politics and lack of speech, Modi said, Congress is over
 shahjade kehete hai ki ve gusse kii raajnneeti nahin karte hai
 Gone are the days when they used to do it because now is the time of anger of the people of the country
 'congress ne virodhiyon ke khilaaf sibiai kaa durupyog kiya'modi ne kaha, ve pichley 60 varsho se gusse kii raajnneeti kar rahe he
 He misused the CBI against the opponents
 is baar logon main itnaa adhik gussa he ki kisi or kaa gussa kaam nahin karegaa
 Continuing his attack on Rahul Gandhi, Modi said, you teach us the language of dignity and ideal
 aap hi ne desh ke pradhanmantri kaa apmaan kiya jab ve america gaye hue the or apane aap ko chamakaane ke liye patrakaron ke samaksh cabinet ke nirnay ko faad kar phenkane kii baat kahi thi
 'he was born with a spoon of gold', while presenting himself as the representative of the general public, Modi said, He (rahul Gandhi) was born with a spoon of gold while i grew up selling tea on the railway platform
 unka jhukaav spasht he jabaki main eemaandaar hum
 He appealed to the people to vote for a servant for the first time after India's independence
 'main us jagah se taalluk rakhata hum jahaan dayanand saraswati kaa janm hua'modi ne kaha janata se kaha ki desh ko ek majboot or sthir sarkaar kii jarurat he, isliye unhen desh chalaane ke liye 60 maheene kaa samay den
 To connect with the people of Haryana, bjp's prime ministerial candidate mentioned Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 hindu samaaj sudhaarak saraswati ne is kshetra main kaaphi samay tak kaam kiya tha
 He said, i belong to the place where Saraswati was born and i have come to the place where energy is communicated in the name of Swamiji
 meraa aapke saath gaharaa naata he
 The dilemma over government formation in Maharashtra is growing even more
 pehle bijepi (BJP) ne sarkaar banane se inkaar kar diya, phir shivasena (shiv Sena) tay dedline main samarthan kii chitthee nahin de saki
 The Shiv Sena asked for another 48-hour deferment from the governor, which the governor did not accept
 ab rajyapal ne ensipi (NCP) ko sarkaar banane kaa mauqaa diya he
 Today, till 8:30 pm on Tuesday night, the NCP has to reply
 usase pehle ensipi ke sutron ke mutabik kaha gaya ki jab tak congress sarkaar main shaamil nahin hoti tab tak ensipi bhi shivasena ke saath sarkaar main nahin jaaegi

 Chirag Paswan tweeted about this

 Iqbal Ansari, a prominent figure in the Ayodhya case, and some Muslim religious leaders have demanded the central government to give land for the mosque out of the land acquired in 1991
 vivaadit dhaanche ke aasapaas kii 67 acre jameen 1991 main centre sarkaar ne adhigrahit kar lee thi
 Ansari said that as per the order of the Supreme Court, if the government wants to give us the land, then it should be from the same 67 acres of land which was acquired by the Center
 ham tabhi ise sweekaar karenge
 Otherwise we will refuse to take the land
 moulana jamaal ashraf naamak sthaneey dharmaguru ne kaha ki musalmaan masjid banane ke liye apane paise se jameen kharid sakate hai or ve iske liye centre sarkaar par nirbhar nahin hai
 If the government wants to give us some comfort, then it should give any one of the 67 acres of land acquired in 1991
 us jameen par kai kabristaan or sufi sant kaaji kidava samet kai dargahe hai
 Another issue of the matter, Haji Mahboob said that we will not accept the tingling
 sarkaar ko saaf taur par bataanaa hoga ki vah hamen kahaan jameen dene ja rahi he

 sahitya ajtak, 2017 ke antim din duusare satr main screenriter, geetkaar or creative produsar jayadeep saahani, lekhak mayank tiwari or lekhak evam nirdeshak saiyad ahamed afjal ne shirkat kii
 He gave his views on the subject of literature, cinema and market
 padmavati ke vivaad par pichley dinon ai film newton ke sah lekhak mayank tiwari bole- aitihaasik kahaniyon se chhedchhad puri tarah karnaa chahie, lekin uskaa ek sandarbh hota he, jisamen aapako fiction ko khojna hota he
 We did the same in Newton
 film kii kahani ek sapane kii tarah hoti he, ye sapana tootna nahin chahie
 This should continue
 padmavati ke sandarbh main saiyad ahamed afjal ne kaha, padmavati main khaas baat he ki iske balldrop ko transperent tareeke se dikhaanaa chahie
 The characters should take care of the original text
 usamen chhedchhad nahin karnaa chahie
 Drama can be done as a story
 lekin original baaten zyada se zyada hona chahie
 On the issue of cinema and the market, Jaideep Sahni said, "cinema is a medium, from it you can make a wedding video, or an art film or a blue film
" median ko nahin pataa ki aap kya bananaa chaahate hai
 As far as the market is concerned, it does not cost much to make a painting or write a novel, it is in cinema
 cinema main ham ek duniya basaate hai, jisane main karodon rupye kharch hota he
 Our body will never be left out of the market
 bazaar kii sawari karnaa sher kii sawari karne jaisaa he
 We are looking for a middle ground: Mayank Tiwari said on this topic, Mayank Tiwari said, in literature also the market is the same as in cinema
 aap chaahate hai ki aapaki kitaab yaa kavita bike, phir chaahe vah paanch sau kii ho yaa paanch rupye kii
 This is the awareness when writing how the reader will react
 ham bich kaa rasta khoj rahe hai, jaise maine newton likhi use saraahna bhi mili or produsar bhi mili
 Syed Ahmad Afzal said, when we go out to make cinema, a lot of responsibility comes
 usamen se ek jimmedaari yah bhi he ki aap produsar kaa paisa waapas nikaalkar use den
 It is necessary to find a balance of this
 sahitya or produsar donon kaa khyaal rakhana padhata he
 There may be many views of literature, but cinema has only one view
 shuddh desi romance 84 logon ko dikhaai 75 bole ashleel he: jayadeep sahniceshan ko aage badhaate hue bich kaa rasta nikaalane ke sawaal par jayadeep saahani ne kaha, ek hota he ki ham apane liye likhte hai, yadi ham apane liye na likhen to usamen aatma nahin hoti
 Second, we write for audiences, they are spending their time and money
 unke time kii kadra karnaa jaruri he
 Whose thing is to judge from the subject
 jaise hamane apni film shuddh desi romance kareeb 84 logon ko dikhaai, jinamein 75 logon ne kaha ki mat relies karo, ashleel he
 But it was heard ten days before the release
 is main dedh sau logon ne apane dedh saal lagaae the
 Sahni further said, we are storytellers and our job is to extract and tell stories of our society
 ab samaaj main dilli kaa middle class bhi ho saktaa he, athlete bhi or criminal bhi
 Meera Nair has a line, if we don't tell stories then who will tell
 ab yadi samaaj main ladkaa-ladkiyaan saath rah rahe hai to ye jhooth to nahin he, rah rahe hai wo
 Story work is not to judge

 The international court stayed the execution of Jadhav on India's appeal
 bharat or pakistan ne apni vistrut arji or jawaab antarrashtriya adaalat main pesh kar diye hai
 Qureshi told reporters in his home town of Multan in south Punjab that we have solid evidence against Jadhav and hope that we will win the case in international court

 pakistan kaa kahana he ki uske suraksha balon ne jadhav ko baluchistan praant se march 2016 main tab giraftaar kiya tha jab vah kathith rup se iran se desh main ghuse the
 Pakistan has said in the international court that Jadhav is not a normal person, but he entered the country with the intention of espionage and sabotage
 vahiin bharat ne shuru se hi in aaropon se inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki jadhav kaa apharan iran se kiya gaya tha jahaan vah nausena se sevanivrutt hone ke baad apane vyapaar ke silsile main rah rahe the, lekin unka sarkaar se koi sampark nahin tha
 On the talks between India and Pakistan, Qureshi said that Pakistan wants to resolve Kashmir issue peacefully through talks with India

 However, Priyanka Gandhi has not yet agreed to campaign
 lekin aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki priyanka jald hi chunaav main prachaar karengi
 Two important things were seen on Monday with the party's publicity van parked right in front of the Samajwadi Party office
 yun to chunaav ke samay netaaon ke katout bananaa koi khaas baat nahin he
 But these cut outs of Samajwadi Party have two shocking things
 mulaayam singh yadav bhale hi daawa kar rahe ho ki vahagathabandhan se naaraaz hanore congress ke pratyaashiyon ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar utaarenge
 But in the cut-out that has been made, there is also a cut-out with Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi in which Mulayam is seen above Akhilesh
 yani akhilesh samarthakon kaa kahana he netaa ji maane naa maane unka aashirwad hamaare saath he
 But the result of confusion regarding Priyanka's election campaign is that Priyanka's cutout is ready with Akhilesh and Rahul but is kept locked inside the van
 cat out banane vaale logon kaa kahana he ki unhen is baat ke kade aadesh hai ki jab tak anumati naa mili tab tak priyanka kaa katout saamne nahin aana chahie
 Samajwadi Party leaders are not ready to talk on this, but they are telling the story of confusion in the midst of cut-out alliance

 com / pnkivm20ez — US Open Tennis (@usopen) October 23, 2017 Raksha Bandhan 2019: 15 agast ko raakhi (rakhi) manaai ja rahi he
 This time both Raksha Bandhan and Independence Day are being celebrated on the same day
 raakhi (rakhi 2019) ke din bahan apane bhai ko raakhi baandhti hai or badale main bhai bahan ko tohfa dete hai
 But many siblings do not meet each other
 baavjood iske bahanen apane bhaaiyon ke haath suune nahin rahane deteen, wo kaise bhi karke bhaaiyon ke liye raakhi bhijwa hi detii hai
 But what about the brothers! They simply promise the gifts ahead of the sisters
 aap bhi unheen bhaaiyon main se hon to is baar apni bahanon ko raakhi ke din hi unka cash bhej den or wo kaise
 Let us tell you here
 15 august 2019: 73wein swatantraaa diwas par in miseges se den Independence Day kii badhaioshaksh Bandhan 2019: sirf 500 ru
 i will get these gifts for sister Raksha Bandhan 2019: Apply this Rakshabandhan, these mehndi designs are easily made uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ranneetikaar prashanth kishor or congress party ke bich matbhed badhate ja rahe hai
 According to sources, Prashant Kishore is working separately from the party line, due to which the Congress leadership is unhappy with him
 aise main ye atakalein bhi tej hai ki congress apni ranneetik salaahkaar prashanth kishor se rishta tod sakati he
 The top leadership of the Congress is angry with PK for these three reasons
 1
 The wrong message about the alliance was the Congress party's Rahul Sandesh Yatra when suddenly Prashant Kishore reached the house of JDU leader KC Tyagi when SP leader Shivpal Yadav was there
 shivpal ko mulaayam ne dilli main gathbandhan ki sambhaavna talashne ke liye bheja tha
 The series did not end there, after this, Prashant Kishor met SP supremo Mulayam Singh and Amar Singh at his residence and then met Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow
 sutron ke mutabiq ye party line se alag tha
 He had not given any information to the Congress leadership about this
 yahi nahin congress upi main ekala chalo re ke model par kaam kar rahi thi magar pike ki mulaaqaaton ne party kii mehnat par pani pher diya tha
 2
 priyanka gandhi kii bhoomika ko lekar matbheddusraa masalaa jis par party or prashanth kishor main matbhed he wo priyanka kiupimen bhoomika ko lekar he
 According to the UP model of PK, he was in favor of promoting Priyanka in a blustery way in UP
 sutron ke mutabiq pike ke upi mishan main priyanka hi congress kii naiya paar laga sakati hai
 But Congress has left this decision on Priyanka and the party does not want Priyanka to bear the burden of the election in the current difficult circumstances
 3
 Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the leader of UP also left the PK, when she left the Congress party
 sutron ne bataaya kii pike ke style ko lekar upi ke netaa santusht nahin he
 pks work in their own style rather than seeking opinions from leaders
 ek netaa ne kaha ki mulaayam se pike ki mulaaqaat camere main qaid tasveeron ne kaaryakartaaon main asamanjas main daal diya
 Many leaders also complained to the Congress leadership
 vahiin pichley kuch dinon se rahul ki sandesh yatra ki gati bhi dhimi pad gai he
 These signs are not very good for the Congress party
 in dinon sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati ke gane 'ghumar' kii khub charchaa he
 Somewhere the song is being praised, then somewhere the debate on the nuances of dance Ghoomar associated with Rajasthani folk tradition has started
 magar is sabake bich sanjay lila bhansaali is gane main deepika ke dance se kaaphi khush najar aa rahe hai
 Not only this, he is very excited about Deepika's performance throughout the film itself
 unhone apane utsaah ko ek tohfe ke rup main deepika ke saamne pesh bhi kar diya gaya he
 Ranveer gets emotional after the Padmavati trailer, said- Sanjay for the film
 
 
 sahi samajha aapane diarector bhansaali ne apni fevorett actress ko achche kaam ke badale main haal hi main ek gift diya he
 According to a report in Hindustan Times, Sanjay gifted Deepika's favorite Padmavati dress worn in the film to her
 jaahir he is sarprise gift ko dekhakar deepika bhi phuli nahin samaai hongi
 It is being told that Sanjay does very little for any of his actors or actresses
 aise main deepika ke liye ye sirf ek gift hi nahin, special feeling bhi hogi
 The grandeur of the sets, if not the finest but the enchanting, Ghoomar dance, is beautiful, let us know that the film's Ghoomar Song was released on Wednesday this week
 gane main raajapootaana sabhyataa kaa hissaa maani jane vaale ghumar naach par deepika ne parform kiya he
 This is the first song of Padmavati released by the makers
 sanjay lila bhansaali ne is gane main bhi apane signechar style ko shaamil kiya he
 Famous for the gorgeous set and background, Sanjay has also included this factor in the song
 set or becoground par focus karne ke chalate ghumar naach kahin dabaa najar aata he
 Lyrics are well made which give comfort to the ears and keeping it completely traditional, it also has a Bollywood style temper
 ise lekar kahin-kahin is gane kii aalochana bhi ho rahi he

 An order issued on April 25 by the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) stated that it did not want Taiwan to be represented as an independent country
 china ne bheja patrair indiyaka ek offis shanghai main he, or yah is desh main uski ekmaatr jagah he, ko bhi chini naagarik uddyan praadhikaran kii ore se patr bheja gaya or use 25 july tak use sabhi jaruri badlaav karne kaa samay diya gaya tha
 However, until recently, Air India has been representing Taiwan as an independent region, like the American aviation company, meaning that it is not part of China
 iske baad chini naagarik uddyan praadhikaran ne tikhi pratikriya dete hue china kii sibar spes prashasan ko aadesh diya ki aisi websiton kii talash kare jisase use china kii airline website se block kiya ja sake
 Global Times warning: China's official newspaper Global Times on Wednesday warned Air India that some Indian media and scholars believe that India should not consider Taiwan a part of China until China recognizes India's border areas
 
 global times kii ore se kaha gaya ki bharat ne kabhi bhi china ke saath 'ek china kii yojana' par apane vichaar nahin rakhe or na hi uskaa samarthan kiya, saath hi kisi bhartiya netaa ne is niti ko lekar kabhi kuch nahin kaha, to aise main koi bhartiya company kaise apana vichaar rakh sakati he
 According to Chinese scholar Long Jhinchun, foreign companies that want to do business in China or to market their products in the Chinese market have to obey Chinese law
 yahi cheez har desh main lagu hoti he
 China considers Taiwan one of its provinces, although Taiwan is independently administered by its government after the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949
 bharat kaa taiwan ke saath kisi bhi tarah kaa kootnithik sambandh nahin he, lekin uske saath aarthik or saanskrithik sambandh bane hue hai
 Air India has said that it will take up the matter with the Ministry of External Affairs

 Both Akhilesh and Mulayam Camp are accusing each other that the other is keeping the constitution under check, in which case the Election Commission will resort to documents
