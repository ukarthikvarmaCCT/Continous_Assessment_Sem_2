 Explain that on January 22, the Supreme Court had justified the decision of the Allahabad High Court, and ordered the removal of the 200 point roster system
 isaki jagah 13 point roster system lagu karne ko kaha gaya tha
 After this, the Central Government had filed a review petition in the Supreme Court, which was rejected by the court
 iske baad se dalit-obisi or adivasee sanghathan 13 point roster ko lekar virodh kar rahe hai
 They demand that a 200 point roster system be implemented

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable The students of the BHU, who have been continuing for several days, are claiming to withdraw the strike of the stubborn students for not having read Sanskrit from a Muslim professor at the Asarbanaras Hindu University (BHU) after the strike ended with the assurance of Dharnavasi
 kaha ja rahaa he ki vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar (visi) rakesh bhatnagar se mulaakaat ke baad chaatro ne dharna khatm karne kaa faisla liya
 According to the students, the VC has assured them to take some corrective measures in ten days
 dharna khatm kar pariksha main shaamil honge chaatrakaha ja rahaa he ki chaatr aaj yani shuukravaar se shuru ho rahi pariksha main hissaa lenge
 Please tell that BHU students have been on strike for the last several days for the appointment of Assistant Professor Feroz Khan in Sanskrit Department
 chaatr firoz khan kaa isliye virodh kar rahe hai kyonki koi muslim vyakti kaise hindu dharm ke puja paath ke bare main bataa saktaa he
 He says that he has no objection to Sanskrit being taught as a language by a teacher of any caste or religion
 firoz khan ke samarthan main aae madan mohan malviya ke pautrabchayu vivaad ke bich chancelar or madan mohan malviya ke pautra, purv jaj giradhar malviya nefiroz khan kaa samarthanakarte hue kaha ki chaatr ek vidwaan shikshak kaa swaagat karen
 Girdhar Malviya said in favor of Feroze Khan that the students' protest is not right
 hindu uniwarsity main hindu kii kya paribhaasha he, or hindu kise kehete hai yah samajhane ke liye mahaamanaa kaa vichaar jaananaa jaruri he
 He said that students should welcome this and they have got a qualified teacher
 firoz khan ko mila AMU kaa samarthanbiechayu ke professor firoz khan kii sanskrit vidya dharm vigyaan vibhaag main niyukti ke virodh main chaatro ke pradarshan ke baad professor ko aligarh muslim uniwarsity (eemyu) se samarthan mila
 While students of HHBU opposed Feroze's appointment as Muslim, the students of AMU came forward in his support
 eemyu ke purv chaatr sangh adhyaksh salmaan imtiyaaj ne kaha ki muslim hone ke kaaran virodh hone par biechayu main unhen apmaan mahasoos hota he
 He said, we are with him and his ability
 biechayu ke chaatro ne kyon kiya firoz khan kaa virodh?dharne kii aguwai kar rahe piechdi scollar chakrapani ojha ke mutabik, yah virodh firoz khan (biechayu ke professor) kaa nahin, balki dharm vigyaan department main ek gaiyr hindu kii niyukti kaa he
 If this appointment was made as a Sanskrit teacher in any other department of the university, there would be no opposition
 yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki sanskrit vidya koi bhi kisi bhi dharm kaa vyakti pard or padhaa saktaa he, lekin dharm vigyaan kii baat jab koi duusare dharm kaa vyakti kare to vishwasaneeyata nahin rah jaati

 Aruna said that the government's refusal to pay the minimum wage is even more sad after the High Court refused to grant a stay order on the decision of the Karnataka High Court
 yah baat samaj se pare he ki bharat jaisaa desh nunatam vetan bhugtan se kaise inkaar kar saktaa he or us par bhi vah samaveshi vikaas kaa daawa karata he
 Regarding the role of NAC, Aruna Roy said that the NAC Task Force set up for the implementation of important programs considered a number of issues related to the implementation of MNREGA
 kaarydal kii siforishein mantralay ko bheji gayin, jisane kaarykram salaahkaar dal kaa gathan kiya taaki kaarydal kii siforeeshon or gramin vikaas mantralay dwaara jari naye dishanirdeshon ke karyanvayan kii nigaraanee kii ja sake

 CO CK Nair of Swaroopnagar police station not only kissed the forehead of the accused murderer, even called him and looked at him with loving eyes
 uske saath hamadardi barti or phir kanoon se jaraa hat kar apana pravachan bhi suna diya
 Suddenly, the Seo Sahib, who came in the role of a saint, said that mistakes are made by everyone, do not make a son now
 sio ne kaha, 'bhul sabase ho sakati he, ye aparaadh nahin he
 'it was a matter of pride that the case of Kanpur Hyprophile Murder was with IG Ashutosh Pandey

 madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main 28 november ko vot daale jaaenge
 This time, a silent-deaf candidate is also beating in the election season of the state
 desh main shaayad pehali baar aisa ho rahaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav main koi mook-badhir bhi bataur ummidavaar hissaa le rahaa he
 The blind have contested elections in India, but this is the first time for a deaf and dumb person to enter the election field
 is mook-badhir pratyaashee kaa namsudeep shukla(36) he or ve ekasoftware ejeeniyarhai
 Sudeep is contesting as an independent candidate from the state assembly seat
 aajtak
 in spoke to Sudeep's interpreter Gyanendra Purohit
 gyanendra ke mutabik, madhya pradesh main divyang bacchon ke saath bahut galat ho rahaa he
 All political parties are trying to avoid accusing each other
 ham netaaon ko bol-bolkar thak gaye hai
 Now the only way left is for the deaf and dumb to enter politics themselves
 gyanendra ke mutabik, 1996 main pehali baar africa deshugandamein kisi mook-badhir ne chunaav ladaa tha
 Mook-deaf have contested 2 in Africa and 1-1 in nepal-new Zealand
 bharat main aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he
 He is also confident of Sudeep's victory and has his own logic behind it
 gyanendra kehete hai vindhyas kii bhoomi hameshaa badlaav ke saath rahi he
 The caste equations here are based on upper caste and OBC
 yahaan anti inkambency factor kaaphi prabhavi he
 Sudeep comes from Satna and his grandfather has been active in Congress politics
 isliye sudeep ne yahaan se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 Gyanendra told that in fact Sudeep wanted to contest the election of MP next year, but i said that first one should start with MLA
 sudeep nirdaleey chunaav kyon lard rahe hai? is bare main gyanendra kehete hai ki agar ham kisi party ke paas jate to ye sandesh jaataa ki ham publicity ke liye aisa kar rahe hai
 Then being with a party does not support the people of every class
 is kaam main videsh se bhi madad chahie thi, isliye nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya
 It costs a lot of money to contest elections, for this, Sudeep is resorting to crowd funding on the lines of Aam Aadmi Party
 duniya bhar kii mook-badhir sansthaaon se sampark kar paisa maanga ja rahaa hai
 He has set a target of contesting and winning elections for Rs 10 lakh
 sudeep mook-badhir hai isliye unka chunaav prachaar bhi alag tarah kaa he
 Election campaigning is going on through mime and street plays
 slogan bhi janata ke muddon se jude banaae gaye hai
 a youth wing has also been formed which is promoting by visiting the college campus
 sudeep ke saath kul teen interprator saath rahete hai jinamein se ek khud gyanendra hai
 Think of Sudeep and want to say in his sign language, these interpreter translates to the dialect there
 ye chunavi prachaar kitna kargar hone vaala he iskaa pataa to chunaav parinaamon ke saath hi chal chalegaa, lekin sudeep ne chunaav ladane kii hami bharne ke saath hi hausale kii ladaai to jeet hi lee he

 unhone aaj yahaan tak kaha ki rajyapal ne jis tarah se mujhe dhamkaaya, uske baad maine istipha dene tak kaa soch liya tha
 Mamta Banerjee said that i have not become the Chief Minister with the help of the Governor
 jis tarah se unhone mujhase baat kii, wo lahaza nicha dikhaane vaala tha
 Mamta Banerjee said that the governor spoke with her in a very derogatory manner
 mamata ne kaha ki main un logon kii ninda karti hum jo fasebuk kaa istemaal kar dange failaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The Governor cannot threaten me
 rajyapal namit hue hai
 Those who come to mind cannot speak
 vahiin rajyapal kesari nath treepathi ne apni safai main kaha ki mukhyamantri se baatcheet main aisa kuch nahin kaha jo unhen dhamkee lage
 Only talked to him to restore peace
 aashcharya he ki mukhyamantri ne is tarah kii bhashaa kaa prayog kiya, baatcheet confidenshal thi or ise saarvajanik nahin karnaa tha
 The governor cannot be silent in the affairs of the state
 bataaya jaataa he ki rajyapal ne north 24 pargana ke baduria main do sampradaayon ke bich hui hinsa ke baad mamata banerjee ko phone kiya tha
 Mamta did not like some of the things said in this
 mamata ne kaha ki rajyapal ne mujhe dhamkaaya or aapattijanak baaten kahin
 He speaks like the bjp's block president and does one-sided talk every time
 maine unhen saaf kar diya ki wo mujhase is tarah baat nahin kar sakate
 They can't threaten me
 bijepi chaahati he ki upi main vidhansabha chunaav janvari-farvari main karaaen jaaen taaki notebandi se kaale dhan ke khilaaf bane maahaul kaa use zyada se zyada phayda mil sake
 In fact, the BJP knows that if elections do not take place in january-february, it will be too late, because after that there are examinations of UP board
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar uttar pradesh madhyamik shiksha parishad ne chunaav ayog ko yah likhit jaankaree de di he ki board ke exam 18 farvari se 22 march ke bich karaae jaaenge
 The state unit of the party has informed the central leadership that by holding elections till january-february, it will gain 'the most'
 rajya bijepi unit kaa maananaa he kiboard ejamse pehle agar vidhansabha chunaav hote hai to party ko bahumat mil saktaa he, kyonki centre sarkaar dwaara kaale dhan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf uthaae gaye kadamon par in dinon janata main jabardast tarif kaa maahaul he
 But it will be difficult to maintain this effect for the next two-three months
 yahi nahin march ke baad chunaav hona bijepi ke liye nuksaandeh bhi ho saktaa he
 But in fact, elections in UP can be held before February 18 only when the Election Commission announces dates for it within the next few days

 During the discussion of the two countries, there was no discussion about the operation of terrorist organizations in Pakistan
 america ko apane bayaan main turant sudhaar karnaa chahie

 This is an example of the collusion of the Central Government, the State Government and the company and the brutality of the police
 modi sarkaar logon se is par maafee maange
 Here are 11 questions of the Congress to Prime Minister Narendra Modi: -1
 mukhar or prakhar pradhanmantri tutikorin maamle par ab tak chuppi kyon saadhe baithe hai?2
 The Prime Minister is outspoken on Twitter, answering on fitness, but farmers and women remain silent on safety
 usee tarah is mudde par bhi chup hai
 Singhvi said that it is a government like treadmill which is part but is not reaching anywhere
 3

 The project was supposed to be 25 kilometers from the Gulf of Mannar
 lekin iskaa ulanghan hua
 How? 8
 mukhyamantri palanisvami ne ab tak maukey kaa daura kyon nahin kiya?9
 The Prime Minister should tell whether the Chief Minister should not be removed from the post? Does the Prime Minister feel that the Chief Minister is 'fit' to continue in his office? 10
 vah kshetra aatankwaad se prabhavit nahin he
 In such a situation, why was no option used before firing there? Who ordered the firing and why? 11

 On May 22, the day of the incident, there was an early warning of the agitation
 phir prashasan kii pehle se taiyaari kyon nahin thi

 There is a severe shortage of teachers in the schools of the capital Delhi, on the one hand, the Delhi government claims that there has been so much work done in the field of education in Delhi, which has not happened in the last 20 years
 chunauti jaise kaarykram, mega pitim jaise aayojan karwaakar dilli sarkaar aisa anubhav kara rahi maano shiksha vibhaag kaa uddhaar ho gaya ho par sachai koson dur he, dilli main hajaaron nae classroom to banaae ja rahe par jo classroom pehle se hai vahaan teacher hi nahin hai
 Picture of Education Department of Delhi Government: 1540691 Children 1011 Schools 33000 Permanent Teacher 17000 Guest Teachers There is a shortage of more than 2 xxrep 4 0 Teachers: More than 75% of Principal posts are vacant, instead of 30, a Teacher Write on 80 children says that there should be one teacher on 30 children in Delhi
 i have one teacher for 80 children, many schools in outer Delhi have up to 100 children in each class
 government skool shikshaksang ke mahasachiv ajayaveer yadav bataate hai ki jis prakaar se shikshakon kii kami he, us hisaab se dilli sarkaar ke tamaam project jaise chunauti 2018 puure nahin kiye ja sakate
 At the same time, the chairman of this institution CP Singh says that there is a shortage of more than 25000 teachers, it should be filled immediately
 kai skulon main guest teacher or sthaayee shikshakon kaa sam-visham kar kaam chalaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Despite this shortage, many teachers have been engaged in other court related work
 ye log varshon se shikshan kaaryon se dur hai, pareint association ke virendra singh kehete hai is tarah se dilli ke bacchon ke shiksha kaa str bhi girtaa chalaa ja rahaa he
 Ashok Aggarwal, an educationist, says that the first petition was filed in 2000 by the Social Jurist organization
 is par dilli hoicourt ne nirdesh diya tha ki skulon main shikshakon ke sabhi padon ko bharaa jaae
 But it has not happened yet, because in the meantime, no teacher has been filled since 2001 recruitment and the contract is being hired
 guest teacheron ko hataane kaa faisla kejariwal sarkaar ne liya wapaswahin beete dinon piersi ke jariye hataae gaye saikadon shikshakon ko raahat mil gai he, chaar din pehle ke apane faisle ko dilli sarkaar ne waapas le liya he
 This decision of the government was being fiercely criticized for the past several days
 somvaar shaam jaise hi hataae gaye guest teacheron ke paas sarkaar kaa nayaa farmaan pahunchaa uname khushi kii lahar daud gai
 The teachers thanked the Delhi government, but still many teachers are getting this relief for only a few days
 kya tha maamaladilli sarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag ne 13 oktober ko turant prabhaav se piersi lagu karne kaa aadesh diya tha, jisase achaanak se do sau se zyaadaguest teacheronki naukari samaapt ho gai thi
 PFC means post fixation cell, that is, every year it is decided that the proportion of children is the teacher of that subject and if the guest teacher gets more then they are removed
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bich satr main piersi lagu nahin hoti thi, lekin is saal turant prabhaav se lagu karne kaa farmaan jari kar diya gaya tha, or guest teacheron ko agle din hi naukari se hataa diya gaya tha

 sabhi grahon ke paas apni ek hi drushti hoti he or use saatvin drushti kaha jaataa he
 But Jupiter, Mars and Saturn also have other visions

 Apart from the seventh vision, it also has third and tenth vision, which is extremely dangerous
 ye drushti jis grah, bhav yaa vyakti par padati he, to uskaa naash bhi kar sakati he

 agar shani kii drushti kaa prabhaav ashubh ho to kya upaay karen-- har shanivaar ke din laal vastra dhaaran karke hanuman ji ke samaksh khadey hon or hanuman chalisa kaa paath karen
 - Chant the mantra of Shani Dev every evening by lighting a lamp towards the west direction
 - ghar ke choti or sahaayakon ke saath acha vyavhaar rakhen
 - Use blue or sky color more and more
 shani kii drushti shubh parinaam kab detii he-- jab shani apni raashi makar yaa kumbh main ho yaa apni ucch raashi tula ko dekh rahaa ho
 - When Saturn is in Aries, Cancer or Leo
 - jab shani par brihaspati kii drushti ho
 - When the sight of Saturn is beneficial, then the person gets a boon of wealth and administration
 - saath hi vyakti ghar se dur jaakar safal hota he
 - Success takes the person to great heights after much struggle
 - aisa vyakti kisi kii property yaa paisa nahin hadapta he

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne upie kaal ke jidipi daron ko riviz karne par piem narendra modi par hamalaa bolaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has said that Modi is the master of manipulation of figures
 rahul ne ek cartoon share kar endie sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Through this cartoon, the nda's ways of reducing the economic achievements of the Manmohan government have been enhanced in a very interesting way
 cartoon main dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise manmohan sarkaar kii kamyaabiyon ko kamatar dikhaane ke liye modi sarkaar tikadam kar rahi he
 a new way of counting the growth rate is that the NITI Aayog and the Central Statistical Organization recalculated the GDP of the upa's tenure
 nae tareeke ke formule se nikaale gaye jidipi kii vajah se upie ke samay kii jidipi daren ghat gayi hai
 Such as GDP 8 in the year 2010-11 in the new formula
 5 fisadi he, jabaki puraane aankadon ke mutabik ye jidipi 10
 Was 3 percent
 niti ayog or sankhyikee mantralay ne jidipi gananaa ke liye 2011-12 ko aadhaar varsh banaaya he, or 2005-06 se lekar 2010-11 tak kaa nayaa aankada jari kiya he
 New figures show that the economic growth rate 8 in 2015-16
 2 fisadi thi jo 2016-17 main 7
 1 percent and 6 in 2017-18
 2 fisadi rahi
 According to these figures, the growth rate after 2016 is about 1
 5 fisadi kii giravat darj kii gai
 Adheres to the international standard The new Legal Commission argues that the new method from which GDP is now extracted follows the standards of the International Standard
 modi sarkaar ke mutabik puraane base year 2004-05 ke mutabik saal 2010-11 main desh kii vikaas dar 10
 3 per cent was recorded but when it was removed as per the new base year 2011-12, this figure was 8
 5 fisadi hi niklaa
 When the Congress released the figures, the Congress became enraged
 congress ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or vitt mantri arun jetali arthvyavastha ko hui 'baari kshati' ko chhipaane ke liye jidipi ke aankadon main 'dweshpurn or chalbaaji' kar rahe hai
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that 'failed Modinomics' and 'pakora Economics Vision' have completely ruined India's economy
 purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram said the NITI Aayog's new GDP figure was 'worse than a joke, a bad joke and a bad joke'
 unhone kaha ki aankade manmohan sarkaar kii chhavi dhoomil karne ke iraade se kiye gaye
 Chidambaram said that the time has come to close this completely useless organization

 During his work with Katrina, he has been sharing many photos on Instagram
 haal hi main shahrukh ne apni ek photo soshal media par daali thi jo unki ek puraani film dar ke ek seen jaisi thi
 What was it in Shah Rukh Khan's photo that made Katrina disturb? In the photo, Katrina Kaif's photo was replaced by the actress of Juhi Chawla
 isamen wo katrina ko icecream khilaate najar aa rahe the
 Shahrukh captioned the photo, "because Katrina does not like to eat ice cream in real life, because she works too much, and it reminds me of the film Dare"
 Cos she doesn’t eat ice cream in real, Cos she has worked so hard & cos this reminds me of Darr

 meraa hameshaa se maananaa rahaa he ki bharat garib logon ke saath ek amir desh he
 We are rich in natural resources and our people are very smart, creative, hardworking and ambitious

 phir aisa kyon he ki vahi shiksha or usee prishthbhumi vaale log apane desh main kumhalane lagate hai? is vishaal urja kaa paryaapt dohan nahin ho paa rahaa he
 What needs to be done to use it? Energy can create wealth for both the individual and the nation? What is the problem in our environment that prevents us from realizing our full potential? My answer is simple
 yah hamaari sarkaar or hamaara siyaasi varg he
 This does not apply to any particular party or government
 yah aisi samasya he jisane hamen kai dashakon tak trast kiya he
 i do not mean to say that i do not believe in our parliamentary democracy
 aisa katai nahin he
 Despite all the flaws, parliamentary democracy is the only way through which the governance of India can be run
 haalanki, aazaadee ke baad ke saat dashakon main, kuch kalkhand ko chhodkar, hamane bade paimaane par loklubhaavanavaad, apana hit dekhne kaa najariya, tarkahin aarthik nitiyon or duuradrushtiviheen kharaab netritv ko dekha he
 As a result, the economy has suffered badly from contradictions and vested interests

 They have amazing communication skills
 ve bharat ko badalanaa chaahate hai, chaahe aap ise pasand karen yaa nahin
 i am talking about Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 apni 44 saal kii patrakarita main maine unke jaisaa netaa nahin dekha
 i am happy to see that the Prime Minister acknowledges that the government is the problem
 apane swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main unhone kaha, ''main apane afasaron ko baar-baar kahata hum ki aazaadee ke itane varshon baad, kya ham lalaphitaashahee ko khatm karne or aam aadmi ke dainik jivan main sarkaar ke dakhal ko kam karne ke liye kuch nahin kar sakate?''ab unhen apni baton ko jameen par utaarna he
 i have two humble suggestions on how this work can be done
 pehla, koi bhi aarthik niti ek vaicharik dhaanche ke bheetar honi chahie
 Once you are committed to a basic belief, then the rest of the things begin to correct themselves
 nitiyaan bhi saamanjasypurna or susangat hongi
 And in just one word, that is the basic belief - market
 aarthik muddon ko bazaar kii takaton ko hal karne den
 i believe that if you want to keep the government out of the way of the people, then you need to trust the market
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar sarkaar kii nitiyaan taiyaar kii jaani chahie
 Allow prices to come down through competition, not government orders
 upabhoktaaon ko vah mulya tay karne den jin par ve utpaada khareednaa chaahate hai
 The market can be cruel at times, but in the same way you can get new industries, new products and innovations
 isi se aapako ek jeevant arthvyavastha milti he
 The consumer should be the king of the market, not the government
 sarkaar kaa kaam maanakon kaa nirdhaaran karnaa tathaa kadachaar or ekadhikaar ko rokna he
 It should move away from this responsibility
 ise pratispardhaa ko rokane ke bajaae use protsaahit karnaa chahie
 But, the government does not trust the market
 asal main bhaajapa dakshinpanth kii baat to karti he, lekin chalati vampanth kii tarah he
 The Prime Minister made another important statement in his Independence Day speech
 unhone kaha, ''aavashyaktaa he ki desh ke liye dhan nirmaataaon ko sammaan or protsaahan mili
 Their pride should be increased
 agar dhan kaa srijan hi nahin ho paaegaa, to phir dhan vitarit kaise hoga
 "therefore, there should be no dirty word seen in India with money suspicion
 kar aatankwaad, maamuli animayittaaon ke liye jail, atyadhik kar, bina vyakti ko chetavanee die uske liye lukout notice jari karnaa
 
 
 There should be no place for such things in a society that respects entrepreneurship
 yah bhaavana agar sarkari vyavastha main jad tak pahunch jaati he, to isse kaarobaar main vah josh aa jayega jise paane ke liye sarkaar chatapata rahi he
 Having said this, i would urge the rich of India to introspect as well
 ham bhrashtachar, kaarobaari-netaa gathjod, enpie or duragrahi difolters kii kahaniyon main duubate ja rahe hai
 With great freedom comes great responsibility
 ham ek mukt bazaar kii maang nahin kar sakate agar bazaar kadachaar main lipt rahe
 i would also urge everyone to remember that India is probably the most shameful figure - more than half of this country's wealth is occupied by only the top 1 percent of the country
 sampatti kii yah sthiti sharmnaak hi nahin, adoordarshee bhi he—agar samruddhi kaa hastantaran nahin kiya jaataa, to aakhirkaar keval ek gatiheen or aswasth arthvyavastha hi bachegi
 My second suggestion is that if you want to reduce government intervention, you should start from home — that is, reduce the number of ministries in the central and state governments
 hindi main ek kahawat he, ''naa rahegaa bans, naa bajegi bansuri
 "we currently have 51 ministries, 53 departments and 83 commissions
" isaki tulana main, britain main 21 mantralay hai, or america main 15 kaaryakari vibhaag hai
 Now that reforms have replaced the license raj, most of our ministries have become justified
 ham ab kai udyogon main niamakon ke yug main chale gaye hai
 But still not much has changed, because the regulators are led by former bureaucrats who are of the same mindset - controlling, not enabling
 ek dashak pehle, india today ne prasiddh arthshaastri vivek debaroy ko is mudde kaa adhyayan karne kaa kaam saunpa tha
 He concluded that the country needed only 12 ministries — those included the Prime Minister's Office, Internal Affairs, Rural, Home, Energy, Finance, Social Justice, Commerce and Industry and Environment
 mujhe shankaa he ki kai mantralay sirf isliye astitv main hai kyonki chunaav jeetne ke baad vafaadaaron ko ve puraskaar swaroop die ja saken
 However, Prime Minister Modi has a strong hold on his party and does not really have this compulsion in front of him
 nunatam sarkaar kaa matlab kam naukarshah hone chahie
 The role of government undertakings is related to this
 pradhanmantri modi aksar kehete hai, ''sarkaar kaa kaam koi vyavsaay chalaanaa nahin he
 Sadly, the government is heavily involved in business
 modi sarkaar ne kai nehruwadi avadharanaon ko khatm kar diya he
 But they have allowed a concept to thrive
 ve hamaare saarvajanik kshetra ke upkram (piesu) hai jinhen pandit nehru 'aadhunik bharat ke mandir' kaha karte the
 Many of them are now temples of ruin
 desh main 257 kendriya piesu hai, jinamein se 71 ghate main hai
 In March 2018, together they were at an annual loss of over Rs 30,000 crore
 yah raashi itani he ki isse teen saal tak 12 karod se adhik bacchon ko madhyahn bhojan pradaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Out of 1,308 public sector enterprises in the states, only 989 are operational and their losses are around Rs 1 lakh crore
 yah desh kii shiksha par kharch kii jane vaali raashi se thodaa hi adhik he
 The story of public sector banks (psbs) is even more frightening
 beete do varshon main, sarkaar ne unhen 2
 Up to 7 lakh crore rupees have been given new capital
 yah raashi 26 karod manaregaa mazdooron kii mazdooree kaa chaar varshon tak bhugtan karne ke liye paryaapt he
 In any market economy, such losses in psus and psbs should be borne by the shareholders investing in them
 hamaare desh main karadaata par vah boj lad diya jaataa he
 Your money and my money are used to pay for the stupidity of bankers and their associates
 yah desh ke dhan kii badi barbaadi he
 It can be used for the welfare of the needy and building infrastructure
 sarkaar ko har str par vyavsaay chalaane ke kaam se baahar nikalnaa hoga
 Continuous control over businesses will mean sending them slowly to death
 sach kahuun to, bharat main bahut kuch nahin badalegaa, agar sarkaar bazaar main vishwaas karnaa shuru nahin karti or naukarshahi kii bhoomika ko kam nahin karti
 The Prime Minister needs the same boldness and foresight in economic decisions as he has shown in political decisions
 anuchhed 370 ko nirast karke jammu or kashmir ko mili vishesh darje ko chhinana, aisa hi ek saahasik kadam tha
 This changed the direction of discussion about Kashmir
 desh ke sabase ahm mudde, hamaare rajnatik netritv kii gunvattta, par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa yah ek acha avasar he
 Strong politics is the life force of democracy
 or main is baat ko majbootee se kahana chahta hum—bharat apane netritv kii gunvattta main khami ke kaaran pichhadaa he
 There are leaders in every party who are ignorant, unskilled and ignorant of the aspirations of the people
 aapraadhik record vaale saansad badi sankhya main nai loksabhaa main pahunche hai
 Corruption is rampant
 dalbadal aam baat ho gaya he
 There is really no opposition in the country
 vah bhi tab jab satta main majboot sarkaar ke hone ke kaaran desh ko vishwasaneey, spasht, karishmai, satark or urjavan vipaksh kii jarurat he
 India is a proud and rational society
 satta main baithe or satta se baahar, donon tabakon ke netaaon ko virdohi mat ke liye jagah rakhni chahie
 a strong government has the courage to accept fact-based criticisms
 loktantr hamaara sabase bada khajaana he
 We must cherish it, protect it and promote it
 iskaa ek tarika he, press kii swatantraaa sunishchit karnaa
 There is no point in ending the messenger
 aaj kii duniya main, sandesh ko mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa, balki aisa karne kii koshish main aap apane haath jala lete hai
 Of course, some bad things are found in every side of life, but for this the whole life should not be whipped
 main aapse vinati karata hum ki swatantra media kaa samarthan karen
 An alert country creates a healthy and civilized society
 kaary karne, aatmanirikshan or parivartan ke liye yahi sabase mahatvapurn kshetra he
 Any country can be as good as the leader of that country
 aakhir bharat main vah kya pareshaani he jo hamen apni puri kshamta kaa ehsaas karaane se rokatii he? meraa jawaab saral he
 This is our government and our political class *** pappu yadav ke baad mohammad shahabuddin ko tihaad jail main shift kiye jane se bihar ke anya bahubali netaaon ke liye bhi ye maang teji se uth sakati he
 It will be interesting to see however, which court will shift Bahubali from Bihar to Tihar
 master blaster sachin tendulkar or captain mahendra singh dhoni austrailia ke purv captain ian chapel kii ‘2010 vishwa ekadash’ main jagah banane vaale chaar bharatiyon main shaamil hai, jisamen ek bhi austrailian khilaadi maujuud nahin he
 Explosive batsman Virender Sehwag and fast bowler Zaheer Khan are the other two Indians to be included in the 11 players, with five South African cricketers making the place
 chapel ne ‘da daily telegraph’ main apane kollam main likhaa, ‘‘chaar saal pehle austrailian cricket team sheersh par thi

" 2010 kii team main koi bhi australian jagah nahin bana sakaa he or shen watasan 12wein khilaadi hai
 Chappell has called Sehwag the most dangerous batsman in the world at this time
 unhone likhaa, ‘‘vah aisa visphotak salaami ballebaaj he, jo test ke shuruaati satr main match jeeta saktaa he
 He is the most dangerous batsman in world cricket
 ’’ unhone tendulkar kii prashansa karte hue kaha ki umr ke saath is 37 varshiya ballebaaj kaa pradarshan bhi behatar hota ja rahaa he
 Chappell said, "unlike Ricky Ponting, Tendulkar's performance has improved with age and he is enjoying it as well
" usne gendbaajon par dabadabaa banane kii kala ko bhi dobaaraa khoj liya he
 On choosing Dhoni and Zaheer, Chappell said that he is consistently doing well in his role
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jab bhi bharat ko jarurat hoti he, dhoni lagaataar ran bana rahe hai or wicketcaping main bhi acha kaam kar rahe hai
 He is also a Spartan captain
 vahiin jahir nayi or puraani gend se khatarnaak gendbaaj banataa ja rahaa he

 ’’ vishwa ekadash main shaamil hone vaale anya khilaadi dakshin africa ke captain greem smith, hashim amala, olerounder jaak kallis, aakraamak abi divilliars or tej gendbaaj del sten hai

 Aishwarya Rai and Rekha often have a special relationship
 ab aishwarya raay ne rekha ke liye kuch aisa kah diya he ki aap yakeen nahin karenge
 Actually on the occasion of Aishwarya Rai Stardust Awards, Aishwarya Rai called Rekha as mother in front of the audience on stage, which shocked everyone
 ravivaar ko telecast hue in awords main jabaaishwaryako unki kambek film jajba ke liye power pack parformar ke aword se nawaja gaya to stage par unhen yah aword dene actress rekha ko bulaayaa gaya
 Aishwarya was very happy to receive this award at the hands of Rekha and after winning this award, she said, it is an honor to get this award from mother
 ("it's great to receive it from maa
 ")
 aishwarya kii is baat parrekha ne jawaab dete hue kaha, main ummid karti hum ki main kai saalon tak aapako aise hi aword detii rahun
 The stalwarts and the audience present at the award ceremony surprised everyone, as well as the recent Star Screen Awards, with Bhrekha and Jaya Gale joining everyone

 bengali televijan kii mashhoor actress juhi sengupta (juhi Sengupta) ne haal hi main kolkata ke ek petrol pump ke karmchaariyon pargambhir aarope lagaaya he
 Juhi told that when she went to the petrel pump with her parents, the staff there misbehaved with them
 darasal, juhi apane parents ke saath ravivaar kii subah ghoomane nikali thim
 When she stopped to fill petrol, she asked to fill petrol of 1500 rupees, but instead of 1500, the employee filled petrol of 3 thousand rupees
 jab juhi ke papa ne karmchaaree se is bare main poocha to usne unako dhakka de diya or gaadi kii chaabi bhi chin lee
 However, the matter was later pacified by police intervention
 juhi bengali tivi serial 'bhaj govindo (bhojo Gobindo)' main kaam karti hai
 He also shared this anecdote on his social media account
 actress ne is baat ko mana ki jab petrol pump karmchaaree ne uske papa ke saath budtamiji kii to unhone bhi police ko phone karne se pehle apana aapa kho diya tha
 On the spot, police from Kasba police station arrived and they took CCTV footage of the incident
 kolkata ke senior police afasar ne bataaya kithane main juhi apane mummy-papa or petrol pump ke karmachari pahunche the
 Later both parties agreed to the agreement
 haalanki is baat kaa zikr actress ne apane soshal media account par kiya or likhaa, 'ye shahar ab kisi ke liye bhi sef nahin bachaa he

 ADR gaiyr munaafe ke aadhaar par kaam karne vaala ellection research group he
 In 2018, where the Rs 1,056-crore bond bikeriport suggests that the balance of electoral bonds is largely geared towards national parties, the largest share of them has gone to the BJP fold
 2017-18 main elactoral bonds ke jariye partiyon ko kul mili 215 karod rupee main se 210 karod bijepi ko hi mili
 According to the ADR report, the remaining 5 crore went to the opposition party's Congress
 elactoral bonds ke jariye funding ne kshetreey raajnneetik samoohon ke maathe par bal laa die hai
 Janata Dal United (JD-U) spokesperson Pawan Verma says- 'the root of corruption in India is the nexus of unaccounted money and politics
 ’ verma ke mutabik “elactoral bonds ko is gathjod ko todane ke uddeshy se sudhaar ke taur par laane kii baat kahi gai lekin isse sabase adhik laabh sattarudh party ko mil rahaa he
 If there is a question of giving everyone a chance for equality, what will happen to regional parties like us? ”unknown donors buy electoral bonds worth up to Rs 1 crore from State Bank of India and deposit it in the bank accounts of political parties of their choice can do
 ye vyavastha daankartaaon kii pahchaan nahin kholti or ise tex se bhi chhot praapt he
 Trilochan Shastri, founder of ADR, says the question is who finances
 samasya ye he ki sirf chand puunjipati or corporate house kii funding main shaamil hai
 Then the government works for their benefit instead of the people who provide them funds
 ye loktantr ke liye sabase badi chunauti he
 ADR has given the Electoral Bond system in the Supreme Court
 The Election Commission has also raised doubts about political funding through unknown banking system like Electoral Bond in its comments
 lekin centre sarkaar kaa jor dekar kahana he ki elactoral bond laane kaa uddeshy zyada paardarshita sunishchit karnaa he or desh kii raajnneetik ragon main behisabi paise ke bahaav ko rokna he
 The matter is scheduled to be heard on April 5 in the Supreme Court

 The Ministry of Home Affairs says that it has no such information
 yah khabar ek angreji akhbaar ne di he
 The NSG chief-isis and al-qaeda may team up with the terrorist attack The Home Ministry has given two arguments to dismiss the NSG Chief's claims
 pehla yah ki iesas or al kaayda ke bich aatankwaad kaa aakaa banane kii ladaai chal rahi he
 That is why al Qaeda claimed to have spread its foot in the Indian subcontinent to beat the growing popularity of ISIS
 sanghathan ke mukhiya al jawahiri ne is sambandh main ek video bhi jari kiya tha
 In such a situation, there is a question mark on coming together
 grih mantralay ko etraj is baat ko lekar bhi he ki aatankwaad se judi khufia jaankaree dene kaa adhikaar enesji chif ke paas nahin he
 The role of this security agency comes after an attack
 use koi khufia jaankaree bhi nahin di jaati
 Jayant Chaudhary had claimed, 'al Qaeda and ISIS are making common plans to attack in many cities of the country
 al kaayda bharat main aatanki hamale karnaa chahta he
 In such a situation, he can also take help of other terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taiba, ISIS and Indian Mujahideen
 agar vah aise oparation ko anjaam detaa he to hamen kai shaharon main ek hi vakt par hone vaale aatanki hamale ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
