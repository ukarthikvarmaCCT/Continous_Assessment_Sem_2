 Lalu Prasad Yadav, lashed out at PM Modi and said that demonetisation made the people of the country helpless
 50 din kaa samay maanga tha or kuch kiya nahin
 Who believes his speech
 lalu prasad yadav ne pradhamantri ko tanashaah bataaya
 His reasoning behind this is that he does not ask anyone for any decision, he did the same in the decision of demonetisation
 ye to taanashaah pradhanmantri he
 Will destroy the country to pieces

 Today is Nagarjuna's death anniversary
 raajakmal prakaashan se hafte bhar pehle hi unki jeevani 'yugon kaa yatri' chap kar ai he
 The author is Taranand Viyogi
 sahitya ajtak apane pathakon or baba ke chaahane waalon ke liye usee pustak kii ek ansh saajha kar rahaa he
 About this book, Vachaspati, a close scholar and critic of Nagarjuna for decades, has written that it was more than twenty years since Baba Nagarjuna left the world
 is bich hindi-maithili kii jo tarun peedi aayi he vah bhi is kriti se baba nagarjun kaa sampoorn saakshaatkaar kar sakegi
 In one place the author has written about Baba, 'he had a stock of memory, parable and experience
 ' taranand kii is jeevani main bhi ye teenon baaten aadyant maujuud hai
 This very creative, historical significance has been completed on Baba's creation
 main itnaa hi kahoonga ki baba kii aisi pramanik jeevani main bhi nahin likh paata
 'yuga Ka Yatri' is the latest strong link in the series of some famous Hindi biographers
 pustak anshah yugon kaa yatri- nagarjun kii jivaniin dinon ke teen-chaar prasang nagarjun jab-tab sunaate the or kuch prasangon ke bare main to duusare logon ne bhi likhaa he
 One incident is about a job in 'aryavarta' or 'mithila Mihir'
 prastaav aayaa ki dainik yaa saptahik patron main naukari kar len
 Both letters were owned by Maharaja Darbhanga, against whom Nagarjuna's opposition was well known
 par, maharaj dayaalu raja the
 Without doing anything to his favored Brahmins like this, he used to give a stipend of four coming, which was called 'chauniya Khoris' in Mithila
 yadi kisi pratishthit varisht ko saath lekar vah maharaj ke paas jate or pichhali galatiyon ke liye maafee maang lete to itane bhar se bhi unako naukari mil sakati thi
 But Nagarjuna looked the other way
 unhen yah dikhataa tha ki desh ke tamaam shoshak zameendaaron main darbhanga naresh sarvshereshth hai, jinke karmchaaree kisaanon se kisi-na-kisi bahaane athasi pratishat tak upaj lut laate hai
 In the era of the peasant movement, he also saw that 'aryavarta' was a vocal newspaper of the landlords
 or, 'mithila mihir’ to ek tarah se darbhanga raaj kaa mukhpatr tha jise raaj ke tehseeldaar or amale padhate the
 If you were told by Aparajita, Nagarjuna was such that 'maharaj called him to read poetry many times, but he never went
 ’ ghar aayi naukari is tarah lauti thi
 The second part is booklet publication
 nagarjun ise 'kitbia’ kehete the
 That means a small book of poems, eight pages, sixteen pages
 iskaa sanskaar unhone janandolan se paaya tha
 Papers of the days of the peasant movement, or the days of the forward block
 kavitaai main gambheer hue to gadhy kaa sthaan padya ne le liya, baaqi uddeshy vahi rahaa
 The prose-verse is the eternal companion of the poet
 shekhar joshi ne likhaa he, pachaas ke dashak main kabhi ek baar nagarjun unase milane hostel-tip dere main chale gayi the to joshi ji ke punjabi saathi ne darvaaze se hi pukarkar kaha tha- 'oe joshi, tera koi gad-pad aayaa he
 'joshi ji may have been nervous to hear Nagarjuna in front, Nagarjuna must have been smiling
 gadhy-padya yahi tha
 How did the idea of the first book come about? When he did not accept the job of 'aryavarta', etc
, the simple question of the people of the house was - 'child, then what is the use of your family?' Nagarjuna used to say - we published a small pamphlet of our Maithili poems and started selling it in a train
 chanaa jor garam vaala jaisaa bechata he na! din main baarah aana- ek rupaya tak le aate the
 Father understand that there is strength in the poem of the boy
 ye ve din the jab nagarjun ne badi hi gambheertha se kavitaai kii duusari pari shuru kii thi
 As if he had decided that he had to become a poet
 inhen dinon unhone 'ravi thakur’ kavita likhi thi, jisamen unke sankalp or aatmavishvaas ko dekha ja saktaa tha
 He described himself as 'a metaphor of a buried coach'
 sandarbh deen-hin-abhavagrast krishakputra kaa tha
 There, he confronted the world-rich world poet with this suppressed coach that 'I too have got the talent of the talent / i am also amused by the lap of nature
 ’ unhone kaviguru se ashish maanga ki 'meraa man sthir ho’, yani ki kavitaai main
 This poem was written on the demise of Ravi Thakur
 yah or baat he ki un dinon is kavita kii ore kisi kaa bhi dhyaan nahin gaya tha
 His 'kavik Dream' poem appeared in the April 1971 issue of 'mod'
 yah kavita 'antim pranaam’ se bhi aage kii chiz thi
 The feeling of love and justice towards the underprivileged was introduced there with such deep sensibility that even the Vajra Hridaya was forced to stop and think
 khaas visheshta yah thi ki andar hi andar usamen ek qissa piroyaa gaya tha
 The interlude of the poem was interwoven with the narrative and the communicability was so straight that it reached the heart of the audience
 phir unhone 'boodh var’ or 'vilaap’ kavitaayen likhin
 Among them, the pain of the mutilated human being, in which the motherland was an equal partner, was expressed with such poignancy that Kiran ji has written - The heart of the poet who wrote this cannot be the heart of a monk sannyasin
 vah sach main badal gayi the
 Nagarjuna went to Kashi from Tarauni
 vahaan unhone kiran ji ko man kii baat bataayi ki pustika chap jane se kavitaai ke saath-saath rozi-roti kaa maamla bhi hal ho saktaa he
 Together, they printed different booklets of 'old man' and 'lament' in thousand copies

 In the meeting, he 'flew away', that is, there was a lot of sales
 dedh-do sau pratiyaan to akele chandranath mishra amar ne ga-gaakar bech di thim, amar ji ne likhaa he
 Nagarjuna used to say - After selling the first day, returned, put the money on the father's hand
 pita ne to hamen naakaara sabit karnaa chaha tha, so paise paakar laad ho aayaa
 By touching the chin, said - son, do not get angry with father
 yahi or yahi ek kshan yaad kar saktaa hoon jab pita se pyaar paaya ho!apni ye kavitaayen vah ek khaas lay main baandhakar gaate the
 These melodies of poetry had become famous all over the region in those days
 shobhaakanth ne likhaa he, bahut varshon baad unhone pethiya main kisi ko yatri kii ve kavitaayen usee lay main gaate suni thim, jo pidiyon kii shruti-parampara se us aadmi tak pahaunchi hongi
 Today, those poems are also liked by theater artists
 yatri kii ye kavitaayen suspasht rup se brahmanvaadi-purushavarchasvvaadi samaaj-vyavastha ke viruddh thim, baavjood iskaa bade paimaane par swaagat hua tha, yah vishesh baat thi
 She was very touching
 vah chaahate to aisi or bhi pustikas nikaalte rah sakate the jo unke aarthik uparjan ke liye bhi sahi hota
 But there were two reasons why he did not immediately think about it
 pehla to yah ki aparajita ko unka yah kaam pasand nahin tha
 She considered it the least measure of earning

 The fast of Monday is started from the first Monday of the Shukla Paksha of the month of Shravan, Chaitra, Vaisakh, Karthik and Magha
 kehete hai is vrath ko 16 somvaar tak shraddhapurvak karne se sabhi manokamanaayen puri hoti hai
 Learn here the story of sixteen Mondays and what is its worship method
 
 
 solah somvaar vrath katha:ek samay kii baat he parvati ji ke sathbhagwaan shivabhraman karte hue dharti par amravati nagari main aae, vahaan ke raja ne shivaji kaa ek mandir banwaaya tha
 Lord Shankar stayed there
 ek din parvati ji shivaji se boli- nath! aaie aaj chausar khelen
 The game started at the same time the priests came to worship
 parvati ji ne poocha- pujari ji! bataaie jeet kiski hogi? vah bole shankar ji kii, par ant main jeet parvati ji kii hui
 Parvati cursed the priest to be a leper because of a false prophecy, and he became a leper
 kuch samay ke baad usee mandir main swarg se apsaraayein puja karne ke liye ain or pujari ko dekhakar unase kodhi hone kaa kaaran poocha
 Shiva Aarti will relieve the sufferings
 Answering his questions, the priest told the whole thing
 tab apsaraon ne unhen solahasomvaar ke vratake bare main bataate hue or mahadev se apane ksht harne ke liye prarthana karne ko kaha
 The priest eagerly asked the method of fasting
 apsara boli- bina ann va jal grahan kiye somvaar ko vrath karen, or shaam kii puja karne ke baad aadha ser gehun ke aate kaa chuurma tathaa mitti kii teen murti banaaen or chandan, chaaval, ghi, gud, deep, belptr aadi se bhole baba kii upasna karen
 Later offer the Churma to Lord Shankar and then divide this Prasad into 3 parts and distribute one part to the people, feed the Gaa and drink the third part by eating water themselves
 is vidhi se solah somvaar karen or satrahawein somvaar ko paanch ser gehun ke aate kii baati kaa chuurma banaakar bhoga lagaakar baant den
 Then take the prasad with the family
 aisa karne se shivaji tumhaare manorath purna karenge
 Saying this, Apsara went to heaven
 is stuti se paaen bhagwaan shiv kii apaar kripapujari ji yathavidhi vrath kar pujan karne lage or rog mukt hue
 a few days later shiva-parvati again came to that temple
 pujari ji ko kushal purvak dekh parvati ne unase rog mukt hone kaa kaaran poocha
 The priest then described to him the glory of Solah Monday
 jiske baad mata parvati ne bhi yah vrath kiya or falswaroop ruthe hue kartikeya ji maa ke aagyaakaari hue
 On this, Karthikeya Ji asked Bhima Gauri, what is the reason that i felt at your feet? On which he told about his fast
 tab gauriputra ne bhi vrath kiya, jiske falswaroop unhen apana bichhada hua mitra mila
 The friend also asked the reason for sudden meeting and knowing the method of fasting, he also fasted for Solah Monday with the desire of marriage
 vrath ke falswaroop vah videsh gaya, vahaan raja kii kanya kaa swayamvar tha
 The pledge of that king was that the daughter would get married with the one who would wear the garland
 vah brahman bhi swayamvar dekhne kii ichha se ek ore ja baitha
 Hathini put the garland on that Brahmin Kumar
 dhoomdhaam se vivaah hua tatpashchaat donon sukh se rahane lage
 One day the queen became unhappy for not fulfilling the method of fasting, Rajkanya asked - Nath! What virtue did you do that Hathini chose you, leaving the princes
 brahman ne solah somvaar kaa vrath vidhivat bataaya
 The king and daughter vowed to have a son and get an all-encompassing son
 bade hone par putr ne poocha- mata ji! kis punya se aapako meri prapti hui? rajakanya ne apane putr ko bhi shiv ji ke is vrath ke bare main batalaaya
 Then his son wished for the kingdom to fast on Solah Monday
 tabhi raja ke duuton ne aakar use rajya-kanya ke liye varan kiya
 This led to his marriage and Brahman Kumar was assassinated when the king passed away
 phir vah is vrath ko karata rahaa
 One day the king asked his wife to take the worship material to the pagoda, but she sent it by the maidens
 jab raja ne pujan samaapt kiya to akashwani hui ki vah apni patni ko nikaal de, nahin to vah tera satyanaash kar degi
 Obeying the Lord, he drove the queen out
 rani bhagya ko kosti hui nagar main ek budhiya ke paas gai
 Seeing the poor, the old lady put a bundle of cotton on its head and sent it to the market, there was a storm on the way, the bundle flew away
 budhiya ne use fatkaar kar bhaga diya
 When she reached Queen Teli from there, all the dishes were littered, she also removed
 pani pine nadi par pahunchi to nadi suukh gai
 When the lake reached, as soon as the hand was touched, insects got into the water, he drank the same water
 aaraam karne ke liye jis ped ke neeche jaati vah suukh jaataa
 Seeing this condition of forest and lake, Gwal took it to Gusai of the temple
 sari gaatha jaan vah samaj gaye yah kuleen ablaa aapatti kii maari he
 Then he said with patience, daughter! You stay with me, don't worry about anything
 rani ashram main rahane lagi, parantu jis vastu par iskaa haath lage usee main keede pad jate
 Unhappy, Gusain ji asked- Daughter! Which god's crime caused you this situation? Rani said - i violated my husband's order and did not go to Mahadev ji's worship
 16 somvaar ke vrath se niklaa samadhantab gusaain ji ne shivaji se prarthana kii or bole- beti! tum solah somvaar kaa vrath karo
 The queen duly completed the Solah Monday fast
 iske prabhaav se raja ko rani kii yaad ai or duuton ko uski khoj karne bheja
 On seeing the queen in the ashram, the messengers told the queen's address
 tab raja ne jaakar gusaain ji se kaha- maharaj! yah meri patni he shiv ji ke rusht hone se maine iskaa parityag kiya tha
 Now i have come to take it only by the grace of Lord Shankar
 aap ise jane kii ajna den
 On the orders of Gusain ji, the king-queen came to the city
 praja unke swaagat main puure nagar ko sajaayaa, baaje bajane lage, mangal geet gaae
 With this, by the grace of King Shiva, every year, on sixteen Monday fasting, he lived happily with the queen and finally got Shivlok
 isi prakaar jo manushya bhakthi se vidhipurvak solah somvaar vrath karata he or katha sunata he uski sabhi manokamanaayen purna hoti hai or ant main vah shivlok ko praapt hota he
 It is generally believed that men spend most of the time thinking about sex and women shopping
 mahilaon ke bare main ye bhi mana jaataa he ki ve sex se zyada shopping, ghoomane-phirane or tivi dekhne kaa shauk rakhti hai, lekin ye sach nahin he
 Women are more obsessed with sex than men
 uttejnaa ke vakt sex utana hi jaruri he jitna bhukh ke samay khaanaa
 There is also a lot of attraction for women in diamonds, gold etc
 Jewelry, but know that women desire sex more than anything else in the world
 kuch mahilaayein bhale hi shame ke maare apane pati yaa bvoy friend ke saamne apni ichha prakat na karti hon, lekin unke partner ko hameshaa hi unki ichchhaaon kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Treat your wife or girlfriend in such a way that they do not feel afraid or hesitated to talk in any way
 aapasi rishte ko is tarah se aage badhayen ki sex jaise maamle main bhi wo pahal kar saken
 Also, keep in mind that do not carry the tension of the office at home and do not always try to dominate them
 kai baar donon ke bich umr kaa antar zyada hone ke kaaran bhi wo khulkar baat nahin kar paati hai, isliye hameshaa unase dostana vyavhaar rakhen or unki pasand-naapsand kaa khyaal rakhen
 Doubt is the most dangerous thing for any relationship, so never doubt your partner and don't cheat them yourself
 iske alaava agar aapako lagata he ki aapaki partner aapako dhokhaa de rahi hai to ladane kii bajaay, uski asli vajah talashne kii koshish karen
 Despite the intense desire for sex, women usually do not express their desire, but you have to understand and respect this habit of your partner

 a senior IRCTC official said that mobile based booking will provide easy facility to book tickets from anywhere and at any time

 The bank will issue MMID (mobile Money Identifier) and OTP (one Time Password) to authorize payment of funds

 He told that he would get the transaction ID and then he would pay through another SMS
 iarsitisi ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki mobile aadhaarit booking ke tahat kahin se bhi or kisi bhi samay tikat book karne kii aasaan suvidha pradaan kii jaaegi
 There will be no need for any printout, as the ticketing message will be considered valid during the journey

 If you are a cricket fan, especially in Test matches, then you have hardly felt a whole year better than these days
 kam se kam mere saath to yahi ho rahaa he
 Well, waking up at five in the morning in a shivering cold is nothing short of torture, but the sensation of watching the thrill of white-clad classical cricket between the Indian cricket team and Australia is no less enjoyable
 khaas baat yah he ki australia main ho rahe test match ke sidhe prasaaran main aap bhale kisi team kaa samarthan kar rahe hon, ho saktaa he ki aapaki team pit rahi he, aapke star khilaadi flop ho rahe hon, lekin iske baavjood tivi screen ke saamne se nazren hataane kaa dil nahin karata
 Is it really the thrill of cricket itself? 
 
 ? shaayad haa, lekin cricket ke romaanch se itar australia main khele ja rahe test maichon main ambiens kaa bhi apana aakarshan he
 The TV coverage of Australian broadcasters is also amazing
 in sabake bich cricket export kaa joardaar panel bhi aapako baandhe rakhata he
 It is a difficult challenge to find another example of the freshness and energy with which Shane Warne appeared during the Brisbane Test and the precision with which he analyzed the match
 bhartiya cricket camentator or ankar kii top list main shumaar harsha bhogale unke saamne ausat se najar aae
 At the break of the day's game, you also see the spontaneity of Damien Martin and his analysis
 unke saamne sanjay manjrekar jaise cricketer-export bhi fike najar aate hai
 Australian broadcasters are considered the best in terms of TV coverage anyway
 shaayad hi kisi duusare desh main hone vaale maichon ke dauraan aapke aise shots najar aate hon, jo pan karke puure stadium ko ek frem main dikhaate hon or phir sidhe vahaan se pich tak le aate hon
 The panel of technology and experts increases the thrill of watching cricket, whether it enhances the thrill or not
 ye sab milakar aisa tilism banaate hai ki aapaki nazren tivi screen se bas chipak jaati hai
 The Australian plains also look so beautiful, that the green grass seems to give relief to the eyes
 in sabake saath aapako australian cricket phans kii bhi tarif kerani hogi
 Very cool and very cool
 bhartiya stand main shaayad hi aisa aapako aisa andaaj najar aae
 But think if all these together do not enhance the beauty of the game
 ye sab dekhne ko baad aap ek brake le sakate hai, kyonki uske baad dakshin africa maidan par dakshin africa or west indies ke bich test cricket ke romaanch kaa anand le sakate hai
 One advantage in the era of satellite TV is that there is cricket in any corner of the world, you can enjoy the thrill of live cricket from home
 dakshin africa main bhi cricket maichon kaa aayojan australian cricket ke ambiens se kaaphi miltaa-julata najar aata he
 However, the West Indian cricket team has become very weak and South African cricketers have shown strong performance in the first Test
 lekin gend or balle kaa romaanch najar aata he
 There has been a lot of change in Test cricket over time, the thrill of cricket has also decreased in the increasing dominance of batsmen
 iske baavjood australia or dakshin africa maidaanon par cricket match, khaskar test match dekhnaa hameshaa sukhad lagata he
 From half past five in the morning to 10 at night, that too does not bore you cricket continuously in the shivering cold

 When Bharat Bhushan ordered to monitor the financial affairs of all Indian airlines in October 2011, the snake sniffed the airline operators
 bhushan ke saaf-suthere record ko dekhte hue airlinon ko maaloom tha ki unke liye apni mali haalat kii asal tasviir ko chhipaana mushkil hoga
 The DGCA found that the standard of safety and maintenance has been jeopardized by the measures most airlines are pursuing for austerity
 bhushan kade kadam uthaane main nahin hichkichaate
 On July 27, 2011, they shut down the Mahalaxmi helipad in Mumbai where helicopters of Ambani, Poonawala, Ruia and Hiranandani used to stand
 helipad teen maheene tak band rahaa kyonki ek audit main paaya gaya tha ki vahaan suraksha maanakon kaa paalan nahin kiya jaataa
 Bhushan says, 'this step was taken to protect those people
 'dijisie pramukh ne deshbhar ke sabhi helipadon kii suraksha audit karaane kaa aadesh diya tha
 The reason for this was that on April 19, 2011, a helicopter of Pawan Hans crashed in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh, killing 18 people on board
 suraksha audit karaane ke aadesh ke baad bhushan kii chhavi laaparvaahee bardaasht na karne vaale adhikari ke rup main sthapit ho gai
 After taking over the DGCA in December 2010, he busted a fake license gang in which 3 officers and 17 pilots of his department were caught
 bhushan ne dijisie main bade paimaane par bhai-bhatijawad bhi paaya tha jisamen sanyukt mahanideshak sahit nau varisht adhikariyon ne apane bacchon ko sah-payalat banane or jaruri sarkari manjuuri ke bina unhen vibhinn airlinon main naukari dilaane main madad kii thi
 Bhushan had sent a report to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in August 2011 recommending heavy fines on eight officers
 bhushan maanate hai ki sakht sandesh bhejne ke liye adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai jaruri he
 The DGCA, which is responsible for the safety of people traveling by air, takes pilots and engineers and licenses them
 bhushan kehete hai ki jab uddyan sector din-pratidin bad rahaa ho to yah sanghathan ke pramukh ke liye chunauti ban jaati he
 Domestic passenger traffic increased by 17 percent in 2011 and the number of passengers crossed 6 million
 varsh 2020 tak isamen teen guna vruddhi hone kii ummid he
 Bhushan wants to make DGCA an active working organization
 unhone payalton ke license ke liye pariksha kii pranali badal di he or use online tathaa paardarshee bana diya he
 All pilots above the age of forty must undergo a medical examination twice a year
 bhushan ne dijisie ke suraksha vibhaag ko bhi sakriy banaaya he
 It is no wonder then that this 1979 batch Kerala cadre officer is not very popular within the DGCA
 naagarik uddyan mantralay ek purnakalik dijisie pramukh kii niyukti keliye guideline banane kii disha main pehle se hi kaam kar rahaa he taaki ummidavaaron kii suchi se bhushan ko baahar kiya ja sake

 Before discussing bargaining defaults, we have to understand who is going to benefit from closed doors? The experience of the WTO, trade agreements, and liberalization of foreign investment tells us that protectionism processions are led by farmers or small businesses and lag behind big domestic industries because competition is the biggest threat to their monopoly

 They have also warned
 samarthakon ne kaha he ki agar ve mantri nahin banaae gaye to vah apane samudaay ke vidhayakon ke saath istipha de denge
 The BJP may have formed the government in Karnataka, but the crisis in Karnataka has not subsided
 mantri na banaae jane se kai vidhayak naaraaz chal rahe hai

 Kapil Sharma has brought a comedy show in front of the audience for the third time
 unhen duusari baar main vah popularity nahin mili thi, jo pehali baar main mili
 Finally, the producers had to shut down the show after a few episodes
 ab jab ve ek baar phir sunil grover ke bina laute hai, to unki safalataa par andeh kiya janaa swaabhaavik tha, lekin kapil ke sho ke shuruaati episods ne jis tarah se darshakon kaa manoranjan kiya, usase saaf he ki aage bhi ye kaaphi antertaning ho saktaa he

 The episode with Vicky Kaushal and Shatrughan Sinha was also interesting

 Seeing the way in which seats have been divided between SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh in Lok Sabha elections, it seems that BSP supremo Mayawati has defeated SP President Akhilesh Yadav in the seat sharing
 shaayad is halaat ko sapa ke sabase varisht netaa mulaayam singh yadav bhaanp gaye hai
 This is the reason why he is talking about the distribution of tickets
 darasal sapa ke khate main kai siten aisi aa gai hai jahaan par uskaa pradarshan bahut hi kharaab rahaa he
 First of all, let's talk about Kanpur seat of Uttar Pradesh and here senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi is MP
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa main joshi ko 474712 vot mili the
 Congress got 251766 votes, BSP got 53218 and SP got 25723 votes at second place
 ab agar donon hi partiyon ko voton ko mila den to bhi vah bijepi ke mukaable nahin thahar rahi hai
 Both the parties have never been able to win this seat so far
 isi tarah sapa ke hisse main sabase kathin seat varanasi ai he
 Where in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, PM Modi won here by a record vote
 unako 581022 vot mili the
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal got 209238 second place here
 congress tisare number par thi use vot 75614 mili the
 While BSP (60579) and Samajwadi Party (45,291) were fourth and fifth respectively
 is seat par bhi donon partiyon ne kabhi jeet nahin darj nahin kii he
 BJP stronghold Lucknow from where Union Minister Rajnath Singh is MP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav sapa yahaan par paanchave number thi or bispi chauthe number thi
 Neither SP nor BSP has ever won this seat
 baat karen pashchimi uttar pradesh kii gajiabad seat par to yahaan se kendriya mantri wike singh saansad hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, SP was at number five and BSP at number four here
 baat karen hardoi sansadeey seat kii to yahaan par bijepi se anshul verma saansad hai
 Bahujan Samaj Party was at number two here while SP was at number three
 yah seat bhi sapa ke hi khate main gai he
 However, if both parties combine the votes received, the BJP lags behind here
 isi tarah barabanki seat se bijepi kii priyanka singh ravat saansad hai, saal 2014 ke chunaav main congress yahaan par duusare number par thi
 While BSP was fourth and Samajwadi Party was number five
 donon partiyon ke voton ko mila den to bhi vah bijepi se kaaphi peeche rahengi
 The Banda seat is also occupied by the BJP, but in the last Lok Sabha elections, the BSP was second and SP is seen going ahead of the BJP if the votes of both the parties are included in the third

 The Jat-dominated Shekhawati region was once a strong fort of the Congress, but in the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP managed to make a dent in this area
 sikar kii 8 siton main se 5 par bijepi kaa kabja he, 2 siton par congress he, vahiin ek nirdaleey vidhayak nand kishor mahaaria congress main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Out of the 7 seats in Jhunjhunu, BJP has two seats, Congress two, Independents 2 and BSP 1
 vahiin churu jile kii 6 siton main se 4 par bijepi 1 par congress or 1 par bispi kaa kabja he
 The special focus of the three Modi, Shah and Raje is that the Congress has only 6 seats in the 21-seat Shekhawati region
 apane is kshetra ko dobaaraa hasil karne ke liye congress puri takat jhonk rahi he
 At the same time, BJP also wants to retain the land occupied by the Congress
 yahi vajah rahi ki mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne apni sarkaar kii chauthi saalagirah jhunjhunu main manaai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose Jhunjhunu for the launch of the National Nutrition Mission and the expansion program of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bhi sikar main purv sainikon ke saath raily kar chuke hai
 While Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has visited Shekhawati during the Rajasthan Gaurav Yatra

 There was a big Kisan agitation here last September led by the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the farmer wing of the Left party CPM, which had good influence in some parts of Shekhawati
 puure rajya ke kisaanon ne is andolan kaa samarthan kiya or raaje sarkaar ko aanshik karj maafee ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 But the resentment of the farmers is still intact because the winter crops did not get proper compensation for the hailstorm crops and what they got was like spraying salt on their wounds

 In Jat-dominated Shekhawati, about 18 percent of scheduled caste people are apart from Jats
 vahiin bijepi ke paas yahaan prabhaavshaalee jat netaa kaa abhaav he, jo the bhi unka yaa to nidhan ho gaya yaa wo congress main shaamil ho gaye
 In such a situation, the Congress is trying its best to capitalize on the anti-incumbency in the region

 The water problem is a big issue in Neemkathana, Udaipurwati, Sri Madhopur, Datramgarh and Sidhmukh of Rajgarh, which the government did not fulfill

 While announcing the plan for about eight and a half crores of rupees, when the minister started telling the details, it took time to read the plan written in English by the officials

 On 31 October, it is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 lekin binar par jayanti kii jagah binar par punyatithi likhi gai
 The bankruptcy of the understanding of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and other leaders was clearly visible in this
 ab is parmukhyamantricya jawaab denge ? ye dekhnaa behad dilachasp he
 On October 31, the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is celebrated all over the country instead of the birth anniversary on the banner
 usee ko lekar palghar ke dahnu tehsil main bijepi ke tahat swachhata abhiyaan kekaryakramka aayojan kiya gaya he or is kaarykram main kendriya mantri smriti irani aane vaali thim
 But the surprising thing is that on this banner, instead of Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary, a death anniversary was written, due to which people are very angry
 police main likhit shikaayat kii gaivahin dahnu nagar palika ke nagarsevaksaid shaikh ne police thane main likhit shikaayat darj karai he
 Action should be taken on those who wrote the death anniversary in place of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary
 bhartiya railway main hone vaali durghatnaon main 40 fisadi maanavrahit level crossing kii vajah se hoti he
 In such a situation, removal of thousands of level crossings under the modernization of railways will be expensive and challenging
 ek anumaan ke mutabik sabhi level crossing ko hataane ke liye kareeb 50 hajaar karod rupee kaa kharch aayega
 Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi will present the Railway Budget 2012-13 on March 14
 anumaan ke mutabik railway ko yatriyon or saamaanon kii suraksha ke liye agle paanch saalon main ek lakh karod rupee kii darkaar hogi
 In its report submitted this month, two high level committees on modernization and safety of railways have suggested that there is a need to eliminate 32,735 level crossings out of the 64,000 km railway network
 rail mantralay ke paas maujuud aankade ke mutabik 32,735 level crossing main se 17839 maanavsahit hai jabaki 14896 maanavrahit hai
 According to data from trusted sources, the pace of dealing with this problem has been very slow in the last two years
 1065 maanavrahit level crossing ko maanavsahit main badla ja saktaa he jabaki 1389 maanavrahit or maanavsahit ko overbrij athwa anderpas banaakar samaapt kiya ja saktaa he
 But to do the speed at which the work is being done, the railway needs a decade more
 navachaar or saarvajanik soochna dhanchaagat sanrachana par pradhanmantri ke salaahkaar pitroda kii adhyakshata main railway ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye or parmaanu urja ayog ke purv pramukh anil kakodar kii adhyakshata main railway kii suraksha ke liye ucch stareey samiti gathit kii gai thi
 Citing the slow pace in ending the level crossing, officials have imposed responsibility on the state governments saying that the states are not spending half the cost
 pahchaan jaahir na karne kii shart par ek adhikari ne bataaya ki overbrij athwa anderpas banane ke liye samay par bhoomi adhigrahan na hona or jhuggivaasiyon ke punarvaas kii samasya kii vajah se level crossing hataane ke kaam main teji nahin aa paa rahi he
 The Kakodar Committee has estimated to spend around Rs 50,000 crore for the removal of all level crossings in the next five years
 unhone kaha ki aisa kiye jane se railgadiyon kii gati main bhi sudhaar aayega

 You may not run like the world's fastest speed Usain Bolt, but you can take inspiration from his life
 jaane usen ke bare main:1
 The bolts come from an ordinary family
 apni bahan, bhai or parivaar kii madad ke liye unhone kiraanaa dukaan par ram or cigarette bechney kaa kaam kiya tha
 Despite the difficulties, his goal did not falter, he wrote in his autobiography that during his youth he never lost his goal and always wanted to be a player

 Bolt belongs to Jamaica's Sherwood Content

 Bolt faced all the problems, went ahead and lighted the name
 aaj wo apane ilaake ke hero hai or vahaan ke bachche unke jaisaa banane kaa sapana dekhte hai3
 Bolt, the world's greatest athlete, was also troubled by this problem
 athlete se pehle wo cricket bowler bananaa chaahate the or vakaar unuus unke pasandida the lekin unhone jo kiya puri shiddat se kiya

 athlete hote hue bhi acha or manapsand khaane main koi buraai nahin he or usen bolt iskaa udhaaharan hai
 He never let the compulsion of good life and work come in the way
 beijing olympic main 100 meter farrata daud main world record banane se pehle bolt ne chikan negates khaae the
 He ate his favorite chicken nuggets even before his pre-race, after that he relaxed for a while and then ate chicken nuggets

 Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has said that two-three journalists of Australia are trying to tarnish his image of Indian captain Virat Kohli, so that he does not have to bother
 austrailia ke daily telegraph ne apni report main kohli kii tulana america raashtrapati donald trump se kii thi
 In the context of Kohli, the Daily Telegraph report said that like Trump, Kohli is blaming the media for hiding his shortcomings
 lekin clark ne bhartiya captain kaa samarthan kiya
 Clarke told Aaj Tak / India Today, "what a fool it is to compare Virat Kohli to Donald Trump
" viraat ne kya kiya, yahaan tak ki smith ne bhi kiya hoga
 Keep in mind that i like Kohli and the Australian public loves Kohli
 vah jis tarah se kheltaa he mujhe hameshaa usamen ek australian dikhataa he or vah jis tarah se chunautiyon ko sweekaar karata he mujhe vah bahut pasand hai
 Only two or three reporters want to tarnish his image, but Virat should not be bothered by it
 clark ne kaha ki australian media jo kuch likh rahaa he, usase yahaan tak ki steve smith bhi pareshaan hoga
 In fact, both captains will ask their teams to focus on how to win in Dharamshala
 clark ne kaha, yah kaaphi had tak ashes 2015 jaisaa he jahaan har test match jivan or maran kaa sawaal ban gaya tha or khiladiyon ne maidan par apana sab kuch jhonk diya tha
 But off the field there was friendly behavior between the players of the two teams
 yah is shrinkhalaa ke liye acha he ki aakhir test se iskaa faisla hoga
 The former Australian captain said that Kohli can score big at any time
 unhone kaha, viraat majboot khilaadi he or agar aap number ek ho to aapako majboot bananaa hoga
 The champions play in a similar way
 vah dharmashala main bada shatak lagaakar vaapasi kar saktaa or bharat ko siries main jeet dilaa saktaa he
 Whenever he goes to bat, a lot of expectations are raised from him
 log chaahate hai ki vah shatak jade
 Clarke said that the toss will play an important role again and India could be in trouble if there is moisture on the pitch
 unhone kaha, dharmashala kii pich par nami chhodana bharat ke liye mushkil paidaa karegaa
 The pitch will be much like Ranchi or other places but i think the captain who wins the toss should also win the Test

 com / js99prbvz4 bollywood main chal rahi nepotism yani bhai-bhatijawad kii bahes main ab ek naam or jud gaya he
 This is Emraan Hashmi called serial Kisar
 unhone is baat ko khule dil se sweekaar kiya he ki bollywood main nepotism kaa chalan he
 When asked about this during an interview, he said - Yes, this is all
 mujhe sirf isi kaaran se brake mila tha
 If my uncle Mahesh Bhatt, who is a producer-director, was not there, i would not have been an actor today
 imran ne kaha ki unka cese thodaa sa alag tha
 He said that i had no special desire to become an actor or be a part of this industry
 lekin maine apana college puraa kiya or sidhaa filmon main aa gaya
 Talking about his son, Emraan said - i will never force my seven-year-old son Ayan to come to the movies
 lekin yadi kal ko vah filmon main aana chaahe, to uske liye rasta mushkil nahin hoga, kyonki uske pita ek actor or produsar hai
 The film industry will try to see my son in the image that has been mine
 uski apni pahchaan usase dur ho jaaegi
 They will not let him make his debut as a fresher or outsider
 bataa den ki is samay bollywood main nepotism ko lekar tikhi bahes chhidi hui he

 Usually, such awards are not given to government officials before retirement
 lekin akhilesh yadav ne uttar pradesh main ek sachiv hi nahin unki patni ko bhi yash bharti de diya
 Mulayam Singh had started that Yash Bharti Samman is the biggest honor of Uttar Pradesh, in which an award of Rs 11 lakh is given and a lifetime pension of ₹ 50,000 is also given

 Earlier this award was given to a select few in the year
