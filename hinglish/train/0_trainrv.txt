 duniya main alag-alag daur main kai khoonkhaar or jaalim taanashaah hue hai, jinke julmon kii kahani rongte khadey kar detii he
 a dictator alone kills six lakh people, then a dictator leaves poisonous gas on his own people
 koi mahaj munh kholane par saamne vaale ko top se uda detaa he yaa phir badan se saare kapade utaravakar bhukhe kutton kaa niwala banane chhod detaa he
 There is a long history of dictators and dictatorships in the world
 par unamem se ye wo paanch taanashaah hai, jinke julm ke aage duniya kii tamaam julmon kii kahani choti lagane lagati hai
 These are the five dictators whose hands are mixed with the blood of millions of people
 1
 Kim Jong: North Korean dictator, charged with cannon blowing and hanged hundreds of people in three years 2
 idi amin:uganda kaa purv aadamkhor taanashaah6 lakh logon ke qatl kaa ilzaam3
 Colonel Gaddafi: Former Libyan dictator accused of killing thousands of people 4
 saddaam hossain:iraq kaa purv raashtrapatihjaron logon kii jaan lene kaa ilzaam5

 in sabhi taanashaah kii khaufnak daastaan se pehle usase mil lijie, jisane taanaashaahee kii sadiyon puraani kahani main sabase nayaa panna joda he
 This is the world's newest dictator, named Kim Jong
 uttar korea isaki sultanate he
 It has suddenly come into the limelight because it blew up its own Defense Minister with a cannon last month simply because he slept during a meeting
 isamen apane hi foofa ko nangakar sau bhukhe kutton ke aage isliye phenk diya tha, kyonki wo isaki kursi ke liye khatra ban gaya tha
 In this country, if a foreign TV channel, foreign films or foreign songs are heard, it hangs it and sets its house on fire
 iske mulk main aam log car se nahin chal sakate
 This right belongs only to the ministers and officers of the Ministry of Defense
 iske mulk main iske baalo kaa style hi sabake baalo kaa fishan mana jaataa he
 According to reports, North Korea's army chief Hyon Yong Joel took a nap in an army meeting
 bas unki isi khata ke liye 66 saal ke hyaan ko saikadon logon kii moujdugi main 30 april ko ek sainya prashikshan range main vimanbhedi top se uda diya gaya
 Hyan was sentenced to death three days after his arrest
 upar se kamaal dekhie ki top se sharir ke chithde uda dene ke baad kim ne unka antim sanskaar puure rajkeey sammaan se karaayaa
 By the way, this is not the first case of North Korea's Tanashah Kim Jong
 kim jong par apane hi foofa or buaa samet 70 bade netaaon or afasaron ko jehar dekar yaa phir top se uda kar katl karne iljaam he
 It is said that he had shot his girlfriends with bullets after getting angry
 kim ko nai se dar lagata he isiilie usne aaj tak kabhi bhi apane bal nai se nahin katwaaye
 He cuts his hair himself and since his announcement, his hair style is considered to be hair fashion in North Korea
 kim ne apane desh main pashchimi media, pashchim sabhyataa or khel vagairah ko puri tarah se bain kar rakhaa he
 Kim is passionately fond of looking like her grandfather
 kehete hai ki ki usne apane dada kii shakl kii chaah main apane chehre or sharir ke kai cosmetic oparation karwaae hai
 That is why he does not reduce his weight either
 kim ko ghudsawaari kaa jabardast shauk he
 But the condition is that when he does horse riding, no one else is seen riding, otherwise he gets him shot
 idi aminek aise tanashaah kaa naam jise bahut se log to insaan hi nahin maanate
 That is why he became known as the man-eating president more than his name
 is aadamkhorne apni zindagi kikahani dhokhe kikagaz par khun kii syaahi se likhi thi or phir ban baitha uganda kaa raashtrapati
 But his real face was not seen by the world yet
 wo cheharaa tha ek aadamkhor kaa
 This man-eater is accused of killing six lakh people
 ye ek aise raashtrapati kii kahani he jise sunakar bade se bade himmatwale kii bhi ruh kaanp jaaegi
 There is a story of such a man-eating president who used to sit on the throne and feed his hunger with human flesh
 lekin sabase bada sawaal ye he ki insanimance khaane vaala ek darinda aakhir ek desh kaa raashtrapati kaise ban gaya
 Actually, the story of man-eater Idi Amin becoming president is as interesting as it is bloody
 ye ek sena ke khansame se ek desh ke raashtrapati banane kii kahani he
 In fact, Idi Amin used to be a cook in the Ugandan army
 lekin uske pasbehad chaalaak or khoonkhaar dimag tha
 But his demon-like body became the first step of his progress
 idi amin kaa kad tha 6 foot 4 inch or uskaa vajan tha puure 160 kilo
 During his army job, he made boxing his career and he was the National Champion of Uganda for nine consecutive years and due to this he was promoted in the army
 1965 tak aate aate idi amin uganda kii fouj main general ban gaya
 But his eyes were on Uganda's throne

 But one day Amin shattered this trust

 On January 25, 1971, Idi Amin took over the reins of the entire country in just three hours
 idi amin ne puure 8 saal tak uganda par hookumat kii
 And in these 8 years there has hardly been any morning when hundreds of dead bodies have not been found on the streets of Uganda
 daawa kiya jaataa he ki apni satta ke dauraan idi amin ne puure 6 lakh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Not only this, the woman who used to look at Idi Amin, who was drunk with power, believed him only after acquiring him
 usne ek do nahin balki 6 shaadiyaan kii thi ourusake45 bachche the
 Colonel Muammar al-gaddafiadamkhor, the enemies of Idi Amin were getting ready as fast as their enemies
 lekin idi amin ko apane doston par puraa bharosa tha or inamen amin kaa sabase bada dost tha libya kaa taanashaah karnal muammar al gaddaphi
 Idi Amin was so confident in Gaddafi's strength that he took hostility from the neighboring country of Tanzania
 30 oktober 1978 ke rose idi amin kii fouj ne tanzania par hamalaa bol diya
 Colonel Gaddafi also sent a Libyan army to help Amin
 amin kii sena or gaddaphi kii fouj ne milakar puure 6 maheene tak tanzania ke sathjang ladi
 But finally the Tanzanian army entered Kampala, the capital of Uganda, and on 10 April 1979, the edict of Idi Amin's oppression came to an end
 or iske saath hi taanashaah idi amin hameshaa hameshaa ke liye uganda chhod kar bhaag khadaa hua
 Idi Amin first went to his friend Colonel Gaddafi's country, Libya and reached Saudi Arabia
 agle 24 saal tak idi amin soudi arab ke shahar jedda main rahaor vahiin 20 july 2003 ko uski maut ho gai
 For two decades he remained the uncrowned king of Iraq

 Saddam's fetishity at the crossroads of Iraq's capital, Baghdad and there is telling the story of the fall of the same dictator
 ye kahani ek aise taanashaah kii he jisane apni zid ke liye apni desh kii janata par itanezulm dhaae ki insaaniyat bhi ro padi thi
 This story is about the dictator who destroyed his own country and his own voice
 saddaam husseinke julmo-sitam kii kahani jitanikaufanaak he uske raashtrapati banane kaa safar utana hi dilachasp
 Saddam Hussein, who was president of Iraq for two decades, was born in the year 1937 in a village in Tikrit, north of Baghdad
 saal 1957 membis saal kesaddam ne bath party kii sadsyta lee
 In 1962, there was a rebellion in Iraq and Brigadier Abdul Karim Qasim took over power by removing the monarchy with the support of Britain
 lekin unki sarkaar ke kilaaf bhi baghaavat hui lekin ye naakaam rahi
 Saddam Hussein was also involved in this rebellion and fearing being caught Saddam fled to Egypt and hid
 1968 main phir ek baar phir iraq main vidroh hua or is baar 31 varshiya saddaam hossain ne jeneral ahamed hasan al bakr ke saath milakar satta par qabza kiya
 Over time, Saddam Hussein strengthened his hold on power and continued to appoint his relatives and colleagues to important positions in government
 satta sambhalate hi unhone apane pratidwandviyon ko maarna shuru kar diya
 Meanwhile, in 1982, Saddam Hussein killed 148 people in Dujail village after a suicide attack on him
 agast 1990 main iraq ne kuwait ko tel ke daamon ko neeche giraane ke aarope laga kar uske saath jang ched di
 The Iraqi army was forced to retreat from Kuwait in January 1991 following pressure from the US military

 But after this defeat Saddam faced a rebellion of the Shia community in Iraq

 After this, the United States clearly spoke of the change of power in Iraq
 2002 main sanyukt raashtra ke dal ne iraq kaa daura kiya or vahaan rasinic or jaivik hathiyaaron kaa zakhira dhundne kii koshish kii lekin isamen unhen koi kamyaabi nahin mili
 Despite this, in March 2003, the US along with its allies attacked Iraq
 or aakhirkaar chalis din kii jang ke baad 9 april 2003 ko saddaam hossain kii sarkaar ko gira diya gaya
 Subsequently, on 13 December 2003, Saddam Hussein was arrested from a bunker built inside a house in Tikrit
 iske baad saddampar kai maamalon main muqadama chalaaya gaya
 Finally, on 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death and hanged at Camp Justice in the Khadimiya area of northern Baghdad
 iske saath hi duniya se ek or taanashaah kaa vajood hameshaa hameshaa ke liye mit gaya
 Watch the game of Kirl Gaddafism
 jis shahar main gaddaphi paidaa hua, usee shahar main maaraa gaya
 And how was death? Gaddafi, who trampled Libya under his shoes for nearly 42 years, was being trampled under his own sultanate
 marane se ain pehle bhi or maut ke baad bhi
 Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was begging for mercy to kill thousands of people
 hajaaron-lakhon karod kisampatti kaa maalik tha gaddaphi, uski jindagi uske shauk parikthaon ko bhi maat dete the lekin maut ke samay wo dhulmitti se sanaa hua tha, khushbooon se tarbatar rahane vaala gaddaphi paseene or khun main duba hua tha, maar kha rahaa tha
 After Gaddafi's death, the regime of oppression from Libya is now over and the flag of Libyan independence is flying in the sky

 The Supreme Court questioned the decisions of the State Election Commission and said that it first extended the deadline for filing nomination papers and withdrew its order within a day
 peeth ne kaha, ‘rajya chunaav ayog kanoon ke abhirakshak hai

 At the same time, Chandrayaan-2 had many other objectives including successfully landing on the lunar surface
 chandrayan-2 (chandrayaan 2) ke lander ‘vikram' kaa chand par utarate samay jamini stesan se sampark tuutane par nair ne shanivaar ko ‘pitiai-bhashaa' se kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki hamen zyada chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 
 
 i would say that more than 95 percent of the mission's objectives have been met
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘arbitor antariksh main pahunch gaya he or use maanchitran kaa kaam achche se karnaa chahie
 After successfully completing the Chandrayaan-1 mission nearly a decade ago, the Chandrayaan-2 mission was launched, which included an orbiter, lander (vikram) and rover (pragyan)
 nair ne haalanki kaha ki lander se sampark tut janaa behad niraashajanak he or unhone isaki kalpana kabhi nahin kii thi
 He said, "it is disappointing for all of us
" puure desh ko isse ummid the

 unhone kaha ki abhi tak uplabdh aankadon ke aadhaar par unhen bharosa he ki isro galati kahaan hui isaki pahchaan kar legaa
 Significantly, Chandrayaan-2 lander 'vikram' lost contact with the ground station while landing on the moon

 neend kise acchhee nahin lagati or kahin vah neend subah kii ho to bistar chhodana kitna mushkil ho jaataa he
 It happens to all of us
 ham har din subah jaldi uthne kaa plan karte hai or vah plan raat hote-hote fail ho jaataa he
 Sometimes we start watching some of our favorite movies, sometimes we stay awake till late in Facebook chatting
 nateeja yah hota he ki subah neend der se khulti he or hamaare saare agle plance fail ho jate hai
 In such a situation, we are suggesting some easy solutions, which you will be able to see every morning in the morning sun
 
 
 1
 Make a schedule for sleep: 7 to 9 hours of sleep is necessary for a common man
 agar aap saare kaam karte hue 11 baje ke aasapaas so jaaen to aage kii sari dikkatein khatm hi samajhie
 2
 snooj batan se bachelarm clock main snooj batan aapke sirf 5 minute bachaata he or inase aapako koi vishesh phayda nahin hota
 So from now on, try to avoid this natural and near attraction
 3
 Make breakfast in advance
 There are many times that grabbing the best breakfast compels you to wake up in the morning
 subah naashtaa karne se jo swasthya kaa phayda hoga, wo to he hi
 4
 alarm ghadi ko bistar se kuch duuri par rakhenyah trick kai baar kaam kar jaati he
 Keep yourself away from the alarm clock and you will have to get up from the bed in this affair
 5
 Abandon phones and laptops 45 minutes before bedtime, this is a tried trick
 aap sone ke 45 minute pehle kisi bhi tarah kii screen-lite se bachein
 This will bring sleep on time at night and will also open on time in the morning
 6
 Keep the arrangement of lights coming in the room in the morning
 It is often the case that we keep our rooms packed from all sides
 aisa ki kahin se roshni kii ek kiran tak na aae, lekin aisi chijen hamen prakruti se dur hi rakhane kaa kaam karti hai
 Try ahead so that some light comes from somewhere in the room and it will do the rest of the work on its own
 7
 Use an old-fashioned alarm clock
 Old things are not always bad
 ab puraane jamaane kii alarm ghadi kaa hi maamla le len
 Topper then his voice and trick used to shut him down
 8
 Do not use any caffeine substance 6 hours before bedtime
 It has been revealed through many studies that the consumption of caffeine before sleeping kills our sleep
 to sone se pehle coffee or chaay pine kaa iraadaa to chhod hi den
 9
 smoking se kar len kinarub is baat se shaayad hi koresahamataho ki smoking karne se hamaari neend ekaek ud jaati he
 We are unable to sleep even for a while
 10
 Use the scent of lavender in your room, you may be smiling after reading this, but the smell of lavender helps you sleep peacefully
 aisa kai research ke madhyam se pruv bhi ho chukaa he ki lavendar kaa aapke bistar or kamare main chhidkaav aapako behatar neend detaa he or acchhee neend ke baad hi to aap jaag bhi sakenge
 11
 iske liye hameshaa prayaas karenraat main jaldi sona or subah jaldi jaagane ke liye aapako rojaanaa koshish kerani hogi
 It is not possible that you will decide one day and start waking up in the morning from the next day
 iske liye sharir ko dhire-dhire dhaalane kii koshish karen
 Set an easy target in the beginning and try to live up to it

 a spokesman of the army told Aaj Tak that on Thursday morning, the Pakistani fighter once again violated the ceasefire at the loc and opened fire at 5 Mahar posts of the Indian Army in Mankote sector of Mendhar
 unhone bataaya ki pakistani sena bina uksaave ke andhadhundh firing kar rahi he or mortar daag rahi he
 The spokesman said that the Indian Army is also giving a befitting reply to Pakistan along the border
 bhartiya sena kii javaabi karrwai main pakistani sena kii chaukiyon ko baari nuksaan hua he
 He said that two Indian Army personnel were injured in the shelling by Pakistan
 unako ilaaj ke liye udhampur sthit military hospital main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 The jawans injured in the Pakistani shelling have been identified as Naib Subedar Tarsam Singh and Sandeep Rai
 bhartiya sena ne do pakistani sainikon ko kiya dherguruuvaar ko rajouri sector se sate border paar pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pok) ke bhimbar sector main bhartiya suraksha balon ne javaabi karrwai karte huedo pakistani sainikon ko dher kar diya
 Across the border is the Rajouri sector, while on the other side is the Bhimbar district of pok
 bhartiya suraksha balon kii javaabi karrwai main maare gaye pakistani sainikon kii pahchaan 32 varshiya mohammad manir chouhan or 28 varshiya aamir hossain ke rup main hui he
 Manir Chauhan hailed from Kahuta village and Aamir Hussain from Bhimber district

 nehru memorial ko sarkaar ne congress mukt kiyaneharu kii vichaardhaara se judi smritiyon kaa cendradilli main teen murti bhawan sthit nehru memorial sangrahalay or librari main desh ke pehle pradhanmantri rahe pandit jawahar laal nehru kii viraasat ko sanjo kar rakhaa gaya he
 Here are the memories associated with Pandit Nehru's political life, ideology
 kendriya samskruti mantralay ne nehru memorial sosayadi ko congress mukt kar diya he or unki jagah bijepi or dakshinpanthi vicharadhara se jude hue logon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, the Congress as well as the Nehruvians are worried about how ideologically opposed people will be able to keep the legacy of Nehru? The construction of the Teen Murti Bhavan in 1930 Mridula Mukherjee, former director of the Nehru Memorial, said that the construction of the Teen Murti Bhavan It was held in 1929-30 and a library of documents related to the history of Modern India was kept in the library here
 desh kii aazaadee ke baad tinmurti bhawan pradhanmantri ke rup main puure 16 saalon takajwahar laal nehru kaa nivas-sthanraha or ve apane aakhri vakt tak yaheen rahe
 After Nehru's death in 1964, the then government converted it into the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library
 'rashtriya dharoharon ko raajnneetik dwesh se dur rakhen'mukherjee ne kaha ki is memorial main nehru se judi smritiyon, unke jivan or bharat kii aazaadee ke andolan se judi vastuon ko sanjoya gaya he
 Here, work is done to preserve and preserve documents and other historical documents related to Jawaharlal Nehru and his life and works
 unhone kaha ki duniya bhar ke buddhajivi or research scollar yahaan bhartiya swatantraaa andolan, aadhunik bharat or nehru kii viraasat ko jaanane-samajhane or anusandhan karne ke liye aate hai
 The country has a large and precious heritage, which should be kept away from political malice
 apane logon ko laana chaahati thi sarkaar: khadgebta den ki pichley kuch saalon main bijepi lagaataar alag-alag muddon ko lekar nehru or unki viraasat par na sirf sawaal uthaati rahi he balki hamalavar bhi rahi he
 At the same time, now Congress leaders have been removed from the Nehru Memorial, due to which the politics has started to heat up
 congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne is faisle par naaraazgi jataate hue kaha he, 'ye durbhaagya he ki sarkaar har faisle ko rajnatik najariye se le rahi he
 This decision was taken only because they wanted their people on the panel
 aazaadee ke andolan kii viraasat se hinsak chhedchhad: manoj jhaargedy ke rajyasabha sadsy or diu ke professor manoj kumaar jha kehete hai ki nehru memorial main jo badlaav hua he use main hinsak chhedchhad maanata hum
 These people do not understand the mood of Nehru
 inhone chah saal se nehru kii chhavi ko dhoomil karne kii koshish kii or inhen itihaas kii samaj bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, how will he handle Nehru's legacy
 vah kehete hai ki nehru memorial main badlaav ko main ochhi or bauni harakat samajhataa hum
 In this memorial, not only Nehru, but facts related to letters, titles, documents, monographs, signs, news papers and all the history during the freedom movement are present
 aise main vahaan bina gaye sam samayik vishay par kisi kii piechdi puri hona mujhe asambhav lagata he
 Congress has no legacy Nehru Memorial: Bal Mukund Pandey: National Organization Minister of All India History Collection Scheme, Dr
 bal mukund pandey ne kaha ki nehru memorial congress kii koi viraasat nahin he
 Nehru was the first Prime Minister of the country, having a memorial in his name does not mean that only his descendants or those of his ideology should remain there
 yahaan nehru kaa virodh vyakti ke taur par nahin balki vichaardhaara or chintan ke taur par hota he
 Man is just a creature and intellect is working, then there is opposition and support on issues
 nehru memorial ko piem gailaree ke taur par banaaya ja rahaa he, jahaan saare pradhanmantriyon ke bare main logon ko padhane or samajhane kaa mauka milegaa
 In such a case, it is not appropriate to oppose it
 'sabhi sansthaanon kaa gujarat jaisaa haal kar rahi sarkaar'varisht patrkaar arvind mohan kehete hai ki desh ke sanvaidhanik sansthaanon par apane kareebi logon ko baitaane ke baad ab sarkaar kii najar nehru memorial jaise tamaam sansthaanon par he
 He has done the same in Gujarat, as a result of which no research paper from Gujarat has been published in the country or the world in the last 20 years
 aisa hi haal ab desh kaa karnaa chaahate hai
 He says that a new type of reading center has been established at Nehru Memorial Delhi
 ham to yahaan 1980 se jate rahe hai
 But it is now being made a political victim
 haalanki ise pehle desh ke pradhanmantriyon ke liye banaaya janaa tha, par ise nehru ke naam par bana diya gaya
 Not only this, it was more politicized than Nehru
 phir bhi ham kahenge ki us samay kuch had tak jo sadsy banaae gaye the unka ek str tha, lekin maujuuda jo sadsy aae hai unka to acadmic se koi naata hi nahin he
 What they will do in such a situation, nothing can be said
 'nehru ko apraasangik banane kii koshish'varisht patrkaar rashid kidawai kehete hai ki modi sarkaar jab se satta main ai he, uski yahi koshish rahi he ki kaise jawahar laal nehru ko desh main apraasangik banaaya jaae
 This is the reason that the Nehru Memorial includes people who look at the country and Nehru from the bjp's perspective
 hamen lagata he ki iske jariye ye nehru kii kamiyon ko saamne rakhkar unki chhavi ko dhoomil karne kaa kaam karenge
 At the same time, Political Professor of Lucknow University, Dr
 dilip agnihotri kehete hai ki nehru memorial main badlaav ko vaicharik virodh ke taur par nahin dekha janaa chahie
 In our view, if they are given a chance, then their work should be seen and only then any comment should be made
 desh main jin logon kaa bhi yogadan he, unke liye raajnneetik vicharadhara or party se upar uthakar kaam kiya janaa chahie
 If the Congress is not able to defend them and if anyone wants to do it, then it should get a chance
 vanade cricket ke itihaas main sirf chaar dabl centuri bani he or chaaron bhartiya khilaadi hai
 It is enough to tell the talent of Rohit Sharma that two of his two double centuries are in his name
 vanade main rohit ne kai maukon par apni kaabiliyat sabit kii, lekin khud ko test main sabit karnaa ab bhi baaki he
 Rohit has played only 7 Tests so far, with 489 runs to his name
 isamen do shatak or ek ardhshtak shaamil he
 Rohit played his first ODI in 2007, but he had to wait nearly 6 years to make his Test debut and was given a chance to play in the Kolkata Test against the West Indies
 westeindies ke khilaaf debyue test main unhone shandaar shatak lagaaya or har kisi ko apana divaana bana liya
 Rohit was placed in the Test team on the tour of South Africa, but failed completely on his first overseas tour
 dakshin africa kii oochaal bhari viketon par del sten or morni morkel jaise gendbaazon ne rohit ko khub pareshaan kiya
 Especially Dale Steyn gave Rohit less chances to score runs
 nateeja rahaa apane pehle donon test main shatak banane vaale rohit africa jameen par khele gaye do test main sirf 45 ran bana sake
 The New Zealand tour was a little better for Rohit
 yahaan unhone do test kii chaar pariyon main 122 ran banaae, jisamen oakland test kii pehali pari main 72 ran kii shandaar pari shaamil he
 The big batsmen of Team India were flopping on the England tour and Rohit also joined the same line, although he only got a chance to play a Test, which was forgettable for Team India as well as Rohit
 yahaan england ne bharat ko 266 ran ke bade antar se haraaya
 Now Rohit faces a big challenge on Australian tour
 jahaan michel johnson ke saath tej gendbaajon kii badi fouj unka imtihaan lene ke liye taiyaar he
 If Rohit manages to score runs on Australia's fast pitch here, then he will be able to make his mark in Test cricket too, but failure here can distance him from Test cricket
 iraq ke sunni aatanki gut islamic state of iraq and al-shaam (iageies) kii safalataa stabdh karne vaali he
 The group, which started as al-qaeda in Iraq in 2003, surprised the US by occupying one-third of Iraq in less than a week
 vahaan iageies kii kshamta ko kam karke aankna ab bada rajnatik mudda ban gaya he
 But al-qaeda has been lynching America for a decade because political interference leads to the collapse of the intelligence system
 iraq kii tabaahi ke khel main antatru iran hi vijayi hoga
 al-qaeda was not identified in the country before the 2003 American and British attacks
 vahaan sirf ahamed fadil al-khalayilah urf abu musaab al-jarakavi tha, jo us sanghathan kaa sansthaapak tha jise aaj iageies kaha ja rahaa he
 al-zarqawi was a petty leader of Jordan who came from Afghanistan in 2001 to prepare for the attack
 usne apane sanghathan ke liye sunni ugravadiyon kii bhartee kar 2002 main taiyaari shuru kii
 Since then, the then US President George Bush had announced plans for an attack before the fight
 isse al-jarakavi ko jaal failaane or yuddh ke baad hamalaa karne ke liye rangarut bhartee karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 al-zarqawi then blew up the UN headquarters in Baghdad and forced foreigners to flee there
 americanyon or british nivaasiyon ko vahaan se hataane ke baad al-jarakavi ne desh ko grih yuddh main dhakel diya
 isisbusch and his allies thrived from the devastation of Syria knew that al-zarqawi was present in Iraq before the war, but could not understand what he was doing there
 tatkaaleen videsh mantri colin powell ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main apane prasiddh bhaashan main darjanon baar al-jarakavi kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki uski maujuudagi darshaati he ki saddaam hossain or al-kaayda main sambandh he
 This was a big lie
 america kaa khufia tantra jaanata tha ki 9 / 11 hamale or osama bin laden se iraq kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 In fact, Osama bin Laden was skeptical of al-zarqawi's Jordan background even before the 9 / 11 attacks and always kept an arm's length from it
 bin laden ne use 2000 main kuch samay ke liye pashchimi afghanistan se nishkasit kar diya tha kyonki uski vafadari par use shaq tha
 Apart from this, Laden did not like the fierce violence towards the Shia community
 lekin iraq yuddh shuru hone ke baad bin laden uski kshamta ko mahatv dene laga tha
 In 2006, Bush wanted to end al-zarqawi's satanic empire
 al-jarakavi or uskaa pehla uttaradhikari to maaraa gaya, lekin gut ko chhin-bhinn karne or sunni kabeelon kii vafadari hasil karne se sunni aatanki or ugr ho gaye
 Only good administration could eliminate al-qaeda, but that was not possible in Iraq after Saddam
 na apane aap or na hi america kii madad se
 Iraq's politics could not rise above the class-community distinction
 na hi ve aapas main laduya chhod paae
 They did not care what the US expected and wanted
 lekin america aashwast tha ki iraq kaa al-kaayda haara hua sanghathan he or hamalaa ekadam safal rahaa
 The Battle of Syria proved to be a gift for ISIS
 pehle to usne iraq main apane agent ke taur par al-nusra kaa gathan kiya
 al-nusra could be projected as an independent party led by al-zarqawi's former assistant Muhammad al Golani
 tab iageies ne maang kii ki nusra ko yah kabool kar lenaa chahie ki uski vafadari bin laden ke uttaradhikari ayman al-jawahiri kii bajaae iageies netaa abu bakar al-bagdadi ke prati rahegi
 Ironically, al-zawahiri warned bin Laden of his future long ago
 apane antim samay main jab bin laden pakistan main chipa tha to vah al-jawahiri se kahata tha ki jordan ke aatanki or uske iraqi gut ke bare main uski raay sahi thi
 By that time it was too late
 ek anya chhadam namdhari al-bagdadi mahatvakankshi shaks he
 He has succeeded in keeping secrets about himself
 al-jarakavi jis shoharat ke peeche divaana tha, usase vah dur rahata he
 He also dismisses al-qaeda's old leadership because it is unwilling to incite community hatred
 uske samarthak duniya bhar main jihad ke liye al-bagdadi ko bin laden kaa asli uttaradhikari banane ke liye abhiyaan chalaanaa chaahate hai
 ISIS captured Iraq's Ambar and Syria's Raqqa province before capturing Mosul, Iraq's second city
 vahaan vah taliban style main kattar islam lagu karata he
 The occupation of Mosul was a major achievement because it has a symbolic effect as being an ancient city
 iageies ne mosul ke bainkon se 400 arab dollar se zyada kii rakam luti or duniya kaa sabase amir aatanki gut ban gaya
 ISIS is effectively strengthening its hold in the Syrian Desert in the middle of the Arab world and erasing the borders of Britain and France a century ago after the fall of the Osmania Empire
 al-jarakavi kii tarah al-bagdadi bhi mahatvakankshi he
 Last month, Saudi Arabia foiled isis's plan of attack
 iageies ne syria main ladaai ke liye hajaaron videshi ladaakon kii bhartee kii he
 Perhaps ISIS trained French Muslims
 unhone may main brussels ke yahudee sangrahalay par hamalaa kiya, jisamen chaar log maare gaye the
 Iraq was shocked by isis's dramatic attack, as much as the rest of the world
 hamale ke baad iraqi sena ko mosul or tikrit se hatana padaa or sunni aatankwaadi baghdad seemaa tak pahunch gaye
 Iran's intelligence agencies also underestimated the strength of ISIS
 lekin iraq main iran kaa palada bhugolic, aitihaasik or jansankhya kii lihaaj se baari he
 After all, about 65 percent of the Shia population is there
 iske alaava padosi hone kii vajah se iran aasaani se apane salaahkaar, visheshgy or fouj baghdad yaa iraq ke duusare shaharon main bhej saktaa he or vah bhi bina kisi sugabugahat ke
 It is reported that Qasim Sulemani, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, has reached Baghdad
 isse isi baat kii pushti hoti he ki tehran kitni furti se karrwai karata he or maaliki sarkaar se kis kadar judaa he
 Historical opportunity to increase influence Tehran is inciting 65 percent of Iraq's Shias to fight militants
 iran ke liye duniya main arab shiyaon kii sabase badi aabaadi par apane dabadabe kaa vistaar karne kaa yah ek aitihaasik mauka he
 The second number minister in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) says, "the Islamic Republic of Iran is like a lion with which ISIS militants cannot play
" syria main iran ke haathon jo hashr hua, vaisaa hi iraq main bhi hoga
 "the people of Iran blame the US and UK attacks in 2003 for the strengthening of ISIS and al-qaeda in Iraq, while ironically, Iran's biggest advantage has come from the George Bush attack
" is yuddh se iran ke kattar shatru saddaam hossain kaa ant hua, jisane is islamic ganraajya par aath saal tak iran-iraq yuddh thope rakhaa tha
 To maintain Iraq's territorial integrity and as a country, Iran will spend its own money as Iraq divided into Shias, Kurds and Sunnis will be more beneficial to Iran than a strong country
 bhale shiyaon kaa palada baari ho par ve tehran par nirbhar rahenge
 Tehran, like the US, is not seeking a share of power with Shias and other Iraqi communities in exchange for help
 tehran ko majboot shiya chahie, loktantr nahin
 Of course, al-baghdadi did not attack Iraq for the interests of Iran
 lekin ek dashak pehle apane guru abu musaab al-jarakavi kii saamudayik hinsa kii tarah hi isse antat iran ko hi laabh hoga
 Meanwhile, this region of Iraq is burning in the fire of communal hatred, which is very easy to provoke but impossible to stop

 He said that the Chief Minister of Delhi tells him to be the first brother to drive the Purvanchalis out of Delhi
 tiwari ne kaha ki aisa kahkar mukhyamantri aise ghuspaithiyon ko sangrakshan dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Manoj Tiwari said that when Delhi Police takes action against such people, they go out but enter Delhi again

 saath hi unke is bayaan ko supreme court ko chunauti qaraar diya he
 All India Muslim Personal Law Board spokesman Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani told the news agency, "the board believes in the court and will try to execute as per its decision
 bhagwat ne yah bayaan dekar kanoon ko apane haath main liya he
 The government should take action
 The spokesperson of the board, which is leading the Muslim side in the Ayodhya dispute, said that the board believes that the government should take action against such people who are taking the law into their own hands by disrespecting the court
 unhone kaha ki bhagwat kaa ekatarfa taur par yah kahana ki vivaadit sthal par hi mandir banegaa, yah hamen kubul nahin hoga
 Babri Action Committee said that challenging the SC, the convenor of the Masjid Action Committee, Zafaryab Jilani also reacted strongly to Bhagwat's statement, saying that he has challenged the Supreme Court that whatever he decides, the temple will be built there
 jilani ne kaha, 'samvidhan main supreme court sarvocch adaalat he or uskaa aadesh puure desh main lagu karnaa hi hota he
 He has asked to maintain the status quo at the disputed site for the time being, it is not known how long the situation will remain, but Bhagwat has directly challenged the Supreme Court by giving a statement
 'jilani ne ise loktantr ke liye khatra bataate hue kaha ki unhen lagata he bhagwat ne gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko phayda pahunchane ke liye aisa bayaan diya he
 Shia Personal Law Board also said against the statement, Maulana Yasub Abbas, spokesperson of All India Shia Personal Law Board, said that the Sangh chief is no more than the Supreme Court
 ayodhya maamle main court jo faisla sunayega, use bhagwat ko bhi maananaa padegaa
 He said that this is just a juggle adopted to divert the attention of the voters from the real issues in the Gujarat Assembly elections

 unhone kaha ki ayodhya main vaisaa hi bhavy mandir banegaa, jaisaa ki purv main kabhi bana tha
 He also said that Sri Sri has nothing to do with this dispute

 *** grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia ke ‘hindu aatankwaad’ sambandhi bayanon ke sambandh main sarkaar ke ek mantri ne kaha he ki scindia ne apane vivaadaaspad bayaan ko lekar maafee nahin maangi he or keval khed jataayaa he jise bhaajapa ne sweekaar kar liya he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath said in an interview to a private channel, 'this word is regret
 isi shabd (regreat) kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 i cannot change the language that has been used
 ’ unase poocha gaya tha ki scindia ne jaipur main congress kii chintan baithak ke dauraan diye gayi apane bayaan ko lekar afsos jataayaa tha yaa maafee maangi thi
 Kamal Nath said that Shinde used the word BJP but made it clear that he had no intention of any political organization
 unhone kaha ki agar jane anjaane main iskaa yah aashay lagaaya gaya he to scindia afsos jataa chuke hai
 He also noted the difference between Shinde's statement and p Chidambaram's similar statement as Home Minister
 kamalnath ne kaha, ‘antar yah he ki scindia ne bhaajapa shabd kaa istemaal kiya or chidambaram ne bhaajapa shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya tha

 kamalnath ne kaha ki grih mantri hameshaa se hi apane bayaan par safai dena chaahate the or bayaan jari karne ke liye uchit vakt chunaa gaya
 He said, "what would have happened if it took 30 days? It happens
 isse bhaajapa ko matlab hona chahie, aapako nahin
 The question is that the matter is over on this subject and work is being done without making it an issue in Parliament
 ’congress ke pravaktaa pi si chaako ne kaha tha ki scindia tathyaatmak rup se galat nahin the
 On this, Kamal Nath said that this is the personal opinion of Chacko
 kamalnath ne suryanelli balaatkaar cond ke silsile main rajyasabha ke upasabhapati pi je courian ko hataane kii vam dalon kii maang par kaha, ‘main ise manjuur nahin karuunga

 He also rejected that Kurien should not be allowed to preside over the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha while discussing the bill to strengthen anti-rape laws
 kamalnath ne kaha, ‘agar vah asana par hai to vah adhyakshata karenge
 Why not? On the stringent anti-rape laws, he said that every political party is giving more and more importance on this issue and is not in favor of sending it to the Standing Committee
 unhone kaha, ‘meraa vichaar he ki sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko aam
 Consent should be reached and it should not go to any committee

 ek saal pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne daawa kiya ki yadi rajya main bhi usee party kii sarkaar bane jisaki centre main satta ho to rajya kaa tej aarthik vikaas kiya ja saktaa he
 The people of Uttar Pradesh believed strongly on this claim of Modi and gave the BJP an absolute majority in the state in the 2017 assembly elections
 iske baad ummid lagaai gai ki uttar pradesh main aarthik growth kii raftaar main bada ijapha dekhne ko milga
 Now the challenge before CM Yogi is to prove this fact of PM and speed up the pace of development of UP
 yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri he ki akhilesh yadav ke kaarykaal ke aakhri saal main bhi upi ke vikaas kii raftaar centre ke vikaas kii raftaar se zyada thi
 In the financial year 2016-17, Uttar Pradesh's economic growth rate was higher than the country's economic growth rate
 yah growth pradesh main samaajawaadee party kii akhilesh sarkaar ke aakhri varsh main darj hui thi
 This claim was made by the incumbent Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath himself in response to a question asked in the Assembly
 gauratlab he ki vidhansabha main congress netaa aradhana mishra ne yogi sarkaar se sawaal kiya tha, 'kya yah sahi he ki pradesh kii vikaas dar rashtriya vikaas dar se kam he ? yadi haan, to sarkaar dwaara ise badhaane kii koi kaaryayojna he?'ise padhein: modi sarkaar ke in 10 faislon se bad gai he yogi sarkaar kii chunautiyanis sawaal ke jawaab main bataur rajya ke audyogic vikaas mantri mukhyamantri yogi ne bataaya, 'aadhaar varsh 2011-12 par taiyaar rajyaj aay ke varsh 2016-17 ke tvamrit anumaan ke anusaar varsh 2016-17 main stha yi bhaavon par pradesh kii vikaas dar 7
 2 percent and according to the first revised estimate for the year 2016-17 released by the Central Statistical Office, Government of India, New Delhi, the national growth rate in the year 2016-17 is 7
 1 pratishat he
 It is clear from the cm's reply that even before the coming of the Yogi government, UP was developing faster than the Center
 ye haal tab tha jab centre main modi kii sarkaar thi or rajya main akhilesh yadav kii
 Read this: Yogi changed the air of UP in a year, these 4 businessmen have done a promise of fast growth, see the claims of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister together, a big increase in the economic growth of the state in the financial year 2017-18 and 2018-19 Will be seen because the state will continue to get the benefit from the central government till 2019, which was claimed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 ' Social activist Anna Hazare has called off his fast on Thursday evening for the last 7 days
 anshan khatm karte hue anna ne kaha ki sarkaar ne unki maangen maan lee hai
 At the same time, Anna threatened that if the government does not act on these demands in 6 months, then they will go on hunger strike again
 anna or unke log ise apni jeet bataa rahe hai, haalanki agar anna ke is andolan kii tulana unke 2011 main dilli or mumbai ke andolan se karen to yah kaaphi feeki sabit hui
 In such a situation, questions are arising that Anna did not stop the movement under compulsion
 jaane aisi vajahen jo is ore ishaara kar rahi he:bajet main ho chuki he emspi badhaane kii ghoshnthanna ne jin maangon ko lekar centre sarkaar dwaara hami bharne kii baat kah rahe hai, ve maangen to khud centre sarkaar kaaphi pehle hi maan chuki he

 The Lokpal's selection committee consists of PM Modi, Speaker of Lok Sabha Sumitra Mahajan, Chief Justice of the country and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge
 anna kaa kaha ki sarkaar ne unki maangen maan lee he ki us dhara ko hataaya jaae ki lokapal pradhanmantri, empi, emele or cabinet ministar kii jaanch nahin kar saktaa
 According to Anna, the representatives of the government have said that a proposal for amendment will come in the Lok Sabha in this regard
 sarkaar ne nahin di koi tavajjo2011 ke anna andolan ke dauraan tatkaaleen upie sarkaar lagaataar anna or unke andolan kii cameti se baatcheet kar rahi thi
 At that time it was the effort of the central government to break the Anna movement
 upie ke kai mantri lagaataar anna se baat kar rahe the or andolan par najar banaae hue the
 Also, the UPA government had to bow to many of Anna's demands
 haalanki is baar aisa koi najaara nahin dikhaa
 There have been some attempts from the PMO to end Anna's movement, but no minister or leader has reached this movement of Anna and neither has made any statement
 anna kaa andolan khatm karaane bhi unke grih rajya maharashtra ke siem devendra fadanvis or kendriya krishi rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat pahunche

 However, the opposition is not connecting with Anna's demands nor her movement
 koi bhi netaa anna ke saath manch saajha karne nahin pahunchaa
 Even when West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, who was trying to form a front against the central government, reached Delhi, she did not even try to reach Anna's movement
 jabaki anna 2014 main mamata ke samarthan main aawaaj uthaa chuke the
 Learning from the 2011 movement, Anna Hazare had made it clear earlier this time that those who would be part of this movement with him would never go into politics
 yahi vajah he ki ab tak anna ke manch par raajnneetik hastiyaan najar nahin ai
 Hardik Patel also supported the movement, but did not come to meet Anna
 log bhi rahe andolan se duusanna ke andolan ko 2011 jaisaa jan samarthan miltaa bhi dikhaai nahin diya
 In 2011, many organizations and millions of people were involved with the Anna movement
 dilli ke saath desh ke anya hisson main bhi logon ne bhukh hadtaal kar is andolan ko samarthan diya tha
 However this time the view was the opposite
 anna ko apane tent ko hi bharne main safalataa nahin mili
 At the same time, many of the organizations whose Anna was doing this movement including the demands, distance themselves from this movement
 agar aisa nahin hota to jo kisaan maharashtra main padayatra kar puure desh kaa dhyaan khinch rahe the, apane hi maharashtra ke jananetaa ke andolan ke liye dilli nahin pahunchate
 Anna did not understand the status of this movement even as people did not participate in this movement
 pichhali baar jahaan soshal media par anna ke andolan ko kaaphi samarthan mila tha, lekin is baar to unke andolan kaa majaak banaaya ja rahaa tha
 Anna also expressed her pain about this
 in vaadon kaa kya?anna andolan shuru karte hue yah maang kii thi ki kheti par nirbhar 60 saal se upar umr vaale kisaanon ko pratimah 5 hajaar rupee pension mili
 The Agricultural Price Commission should get constitutional status and full autonomy
 is par kuch nahin kaha gaya
 At the same time, Anna had clearly demanded that the Lokpal Bill be passed and the Lokpal Act should be implemented immediately
 har rajya main sakasham lokayukta niyukt kiya jaae
 However, he just stopped the movement on the assurance

 dilli ke dipti siem ne kaha he ki chunaav ayog ko shiksha mafia kaa samarthan nahin karnaa chahie
 Earlier, the Election Commission had ordered a stay on the Delhi government's decision
 dilli sarkaar ne chunaav ayog ke nirdesh ko avaidh qaraar diya he
 According to Manish Sisodia, the education mafia is active in the capital
 saath hi farji daakhile or edablyooes kaa farjivada karne vaale log bhi shiksha vibhaag kii prakriya main adnga laga rahe hai
 Sisodia said that in Patparganj Vidhan Sabha, mcd-accredited schools were found to have malfunctions in children's addresses, following which a magistrate inquiry was conducted in 2 schools
 is jaanch main paaya gaya ki ek skool main 54 fisadi or duusare skool main 61 fisadi skool ke bacchon kaa pataa farji he
 Explain that in the data collection scheme started from September, Delhi Government had asked all public and private schools to collect the data of their students, their parents and siblings
 is data main abhibhavakon kaa mobile number, matadaata idi vivaran or shaikshanik yogyata bhi shaamil he
 Sisodia further said that it is very important to catch this fraud
 unhone kaha ki ham kisi ko skool se nikaalnaa nahi chaahate hai
 He said, "A private school has 200 schools but admissions have been given to 1200 people, wrong people are coming through fake admissions which causes problems to the parents of Delhi, people are requested to give information
 chunaav ayog par hamalaa karte hue manish sisodiya ne kaha "shiksha vibhaag ko matadaata card lene se kyon roka ja rahaa he, chunaav ayog ke paas koi takat nahi ki wo dilli sarkaar ko roke, chunaav ayog kaa kaam nishpaksh tareeke se matdaan karana he, ayog ajukeshan mafia kaa is tarah se samarthan naa karen" He is a scene producing a jugupsa
 isliye nahin ki isamen gandhi ko goli maarane kaa abhinay kiya ja rahaa he, balki isliye ki yah itani kalpanashoonyata ke saath kiya ja rahaa he ki isamen kahin koi vichaar nahin dikhataa- gandhi ko maarane kaa vichaar tak nahin
 It is a flirtatious spectacle with a few slapstick spectacles
 durbhaagya se yah tamaasha bhi 'hit' ho jaataa he
 Just like a vulture running from one pole to the other, gasping and dead thoughts, the media also seizes this scene
 paakhandee raajnneeti achaanak gandhi ke prati udaar ho uthati he or in tamaashaaiyon ko giraftaar karne kii maang shuru ho jaati he
 The motive of the spectacle is fulfilled by so many
 ab unki ek rashtriya pahchaan he
 Till yesterday, two thoughtless people, completely anonymous, are now telling the country that they have no regrets about the drama of Gandhi's assassination and regret that Azad, who is talking of treason in this country, is roaming, while he is being arrested is
 kya ab ham santusht hai? aakhir gandhi kaa apmaan karne vaale, unke prati hinsa bhav rakhane vaale pakade gaye hai
 Obviously, the answer cannot be 'yes'
 kyonki achaanak ham pate hai ki jis gandhi ko na jane ham kab kaa kho chuke, unhen bachaane kii hadabadi main hamane unke tathakthith hatyaron ko akhil bhartiya prasiddhi de daali he or dusron ko bhi ye idia ki gandhi ko maar-markar mashhoor hua ja saktaa he
 But was this the first attempt to kill Gandhi? This was just a parody that did not spoil Gandhi or his views
 jabaki hamaare puure saarvajanik jivan main gandhi vichaar kii hatya tarah-tarah se karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Those who are opposed to Gandhi are doing this work, even those who call themselves Gandhi devotees are doing the same work quietly
 balki is desh main badi chaalaaki ke ek aasaan gandhi ko- ek kate-chante bonsai gandhi ko- bachaaya ja rahaa he or mushkil gandhi ko kinare kar diya ja rahaa he
 Easy Gandhi is what we see in films like 'lage Raho Munnabhai'
 yah gandhi chote-chote anyaayon kaa pratirodh karata he, ahimsa or satyagrah ke sahare apni ladaaiyaan ladata he or enjionuma sanghathanon hi nahin, raajnneetik dalon ko bhi ladane kaa ek tarika sikhaata he
 But this is not the real Gandhi
 asli gandhi hamase bahut kuch maangata he
 The real Gandhi criticizes our consumerist way of life
 asli gandhi vakeelon or doctoron se dur rahane kii salaah detaa he, asli gandhi maujuuda muhaavarey main lagbhag 'vikaas virdohi' he
 He avoids our glowing lifestyle
 arthvyavastha ko lekar uskaa lagbhag utapian nazariyaa he
 The real Gandhi puts such strict criteria to live in front of us that we slip away
 yah gandhi hamen pachataa nahin he, janchataa nahin he
 If this Gandhi raises his head inside us at any moment of introspection, we kill him
 darasal yah vah asli gandhi he jisaki hatya par hamen chintit hona chahie
 But we are worried when a fake Gandhi is fired on
 gandhi kii hatya ke or bhi tareeke hai
 His sterilization is also another way of turning him into a lifeless idol - and thus killing him
 gandhi ji ke jivan kaal main unke aise andhbhakt nahin the
 Those closest to him also disagreed with him
 subhash chandra bose kii gandhi ke taur-tareekon se asahmati to jag jaahir he, jawaharlal bhi unase asahmat rahaa karte the
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar disagreed
 kai muddon par gandhi tagore se or tagore gandhi se asahmat the
 These disagreements also made Gandhi
 gandhi lagaataar apane uttar kaal main pichley gandhi se asahmat hote dikhaai padate hai
 His conceptions of religion and varna seem to be completely changed
 yah isliye sambhav hua ki gandhi ko mahatma kehane ke baavjood, unki manushyata ko baar-baar kasuti par ksaa jaataa rahaa
 The conditions of that era were also such that they created new criteria for them
 lekin aaj gandhi se koi asahmat nahin he
 Because Gandhi is not an object of worship, but an object of worship
 puja murtiyon kii hoti he, putalon kii hoti he
 That is why we get angry when bullets are shot
 asli gandhi ke maare jane par ham jaraa bhi baichaiyn nahin hote
 Perhaps because our faith is also fake, our anger is also fake
 ham virodh karne vaale manushya nahin, krodh karne vaale putale hai
 This is the situation of our politics as well as our media
 uskaa tej jaise khatm ho gaya he
 He means Gandhi's effigy, not Gandhi's, because his reporting is easy, it is easy to prove that Gandhi is being hit by bullets
 or jo log gandhi ko maar kar shoharat hasil kar rahe hai, unke nishane asal main duusare hai- kahin zyada khatarnaak
 By firing Gandhi, he has acquired the legitimacy of an ideology - now he can shoot anyone in the name of country and religion
 jab ve yah kaam karenge, tab unke haath main nakli bandooken nahin hongi
 Then perhaps we will not be able to understand how in our senselessness we have created some more Godse
 trephic jam ke bich achaanak ek baagh kaa 'kud' padana

 lekin internet par post ek video main aisa hota hua dekha ja rahaa he or yah hua he doha kii sabase vyast sadakon main se ek par

 Last year, the government had to issue an appeal when a leopard was caught in Doha

 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare (uddhav Thackeray) main ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar bada bayaan diya he
 He said that just as the central government removed Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, it should also show courage to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 unhone kaha ki ab ram mandir ke liye intjaar karne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa he
 Thackeray said that we have told Shiv Sena workers that they have been ready
 ab samay aa gaya he jab ram mandir kii aadharshila ayodhya main rakhi jaaegi
 This is the issue which was brought up by our founder Balasaheb Thackeray
 uddhav thakare ne aage kaha ki jis tarah se sarkaar kaam kar rahi he, usne hamaari ummiden badha di hai ki sarkaar jald hi ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan karaayegi
 Now there is no vote to wait
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan uddhav thakare ne ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar bijepi par kai baar hamalaa bolaa tha
 He said that from the way the Modi government has worked in the last five years, it does not seem from anywhere that it is serious in any way about the construction of Ram temple
 gauratlab he kimaharashtra main asann vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye siton ke bantwaare par sattarudh bhaajapa or shivasena ke apana rukh sakht karne kii khabaron ke bich shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii upasthiti main, donon dalon kaa gathbandhan ‘‘atal'' he or yah gathbandhan ek baar phir se satta main vaapasi karegaa
 During his address at an event in Mumbai, Thackeray praised the Prime Minister for abolishing most of the provisions of Article 370 and appealed to build a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya and bring in a uniform civil code
 thakare ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh ko netritv or disha pradaan kii he jisamen pragati or vikaas karne kii apaar kshamta he
 i congratulate Modi for ending most of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution and for the Chandrayaan-2 campaign

 He said that Kashmir is and will remain an integral part of India

 Thackeray had said that the country is also proud of ISRO scientists for the ambitious moon mission

 Thackeray also said that an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party would continue

 Where jobs are going, salary is not increasing, wages are decreasing, it is strange to increase fees
 agar sarkari santhaan mahange honge to sabko shiksha nahin milegi
 In JNU, there is a movement not only about the increase in fees but also on the time of hostel manual, library
 kai log kehete hai ki chaatr andolan kyon karte hai, iskaa jawaab ye he ki agar andolan na karen to desh kii uniwarsity main kya-kya khel ho jayega, aapako pataa nahin chalegaa
 In the same way, the silence of the people is turning the university into junk whose loss is being done to the common people

 Students were adamant that the university withdraw the new hostel manual and new rules should be formulated only after talking to the students
 chaatro kaa daawa he ki bina chaatro ke nirvaachit pratinidhi se baat kiye hue hostal minial bana diya gaya
 On November 1, the Vice Chancellor tweeted his side

 Students say that the rule is the same but now it is being implemented
 kyon kisi campus ke kalege main 11 baje tak hostal aa janaa chahie
 Till now the students used to be in the library overnight, discuss the dhaba with tea, then what a loss
 jeenyu ek campus uniwarsity he
 If the library does not open overnight, where will it open? jeenyu kii librari kii tasviir yahaan se paas hone vaale chaatro ke dilon main hameshaa ke liye rah jaati he
 In the dark night, a student who comes to a book by some way, spends time in the library, not to look like a nerd, but to live among the books

 Earlier many reading rooms of the library were open all night

 Transport is available from the library to the hostel late at night
 duniya hansegi agar ye pataa chal jaae ki jeenyu jaisi uniwarsity kii librari raat bhar nahin khuli rahati he

 The university decided that the library would close at half past ten

 pehle room rent 10 rupee tha jo ab 300 rupee prati maheene kiya ja rahaa he
 For mess security, you had to pay 5500 rupees at a time, which is now being Rs 12000
 yah waapas ho jaataa he lekin ek baar main 12000 rupee maangana jo waapas ho jayega
 This has to be done because the defaulters have increased
 das saal baad fees badhaai ja rahi he
 Now you have heard that if a student who does not pay 800 rupees will be charged 12000 rupees then from where will he give

 The case is just a few days ago when Yasin, a second-grade student, was going to his school when he found a purse on the way in which Rs 50,000 was kept
 yasin ne bina koi laalach kiye ye purse apane principal ko de diya or kaha ki ye uske paise nahin he
 The principal also informed the police without delay and then the purse along with the money was sent to its owner
 yasin kii eemaandaaree par jab unase poocha gaya ki unhen iske badale main kya chahie? to is bachche kaa jawaab tha ki vah superstar rajnikant se milanaa chaahate hai
 After 23 years, this will happen again, 2 films of Rajinikanth will be released, just as soon as Rajinikanth came to know about this wish of Yasin, he immediately made up his mind to meet this child

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladai ke liye yah jaruri he ki pehle se hi maujuud agenciyon ke bich behatar talmail sthapit kiya jaae
 This statement of the Prime Minister is being interpreted to mean that the government is withdrawing from its own proposal to create a new federal agency

 For this, the court has also given them time till Monday

 There are three mistakes in the affidavit, for which i apologize
