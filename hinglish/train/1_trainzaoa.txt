 abdul kalam kii ummidavaari par mohar lagaani padi thi, kyonki uske paas apana raashtrapati chunavaane ke liye jaruri taadaad main vot nahin the
 But this time the NDA has a majority in the Lok Sabha and at the same time it has got electoral benefits in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Assam
 isamen uttar pradesh or uttarakhand kii jabardast jeet or manipur tathaa goa main sarkaron kaa gathan bhi jod len
 The NDA can elect the President of its choice with the support of the Shiv Sena and a little help from other allies — the Biju Janata Dal of Odisha or the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu
 aankadon kaa kheldesh kaa raashtrapati saarvbhaum matadhikaar pranali se nahin, balki ek nirvaachak mandal ke jariye chunaa jaataa he
 And the value of votes is decided by a formula
 yah formula 1971 kii janaganana kii aabaadi ke aankadon ke aadhaar par samvidhan ke anusaar nikaala jaataa he
 Accordingly, 776 elected members of Parliament — 543 of the Lok Sabha and 233 of the Rajya Sabha — with 4,120 members (mlas) of the state assemblies, a total of 4,896 electors, can vote for the President
 unke voton kaa kul mulya takreeban 11 lakh (10,98,882) he
 In this, the value of each vote of mps is 708, while the votes of mlas are valued according to the population of the state
 voton ke kul mulya ke aadhe se ek vot zyada hasil karke, yani 5,49,442 ke jaadui aankade par pahunchakar, koi bhi party apane ummidavaar ko raashtrapati bhawan main pahunchaa sakati he
 This opportunity is even more special because with the victories in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa, the mathematics is clearly visible in favor of the NDA (see graphic)
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle endie ke voton kii takat takreeban 4,50,000 thi
 With the support of its crucial constituent Shiv Sena (25,893 votes), the strength of the ruling party has now reached around 5,32,000
 uske paas bahumat ke aadhe nishaan se ab bhi takreeban 17,500 kii kami he
 The allies BJD and AIADMK can help bridge this gap

 Other names have also been in the news for quite some time now: veteran BJP leaders LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, and apart from them RSS supremo Mohan Bhagwat
 charchaa yah he ki pradhanmantri ne 8 march ko gujarat ke somnath main ek baithak ke dauraan agle raashtrapati ke taur par adwani ke naam kaa ishaara kar diya tha, jo apane siyaasi maardarshak ko unki gurudakshina hogi

 How fast, fast track court, these are the rules it takes to decide this court
 Fast track courts have now been opened in most places for quick disposal of cases on the incidents of rape and sexual harassment occurring with 2 years
 hyderabad main ladi doctor ke saath hui haivaaniyat se puraa desh dahal gaya he
 Now the case will be heard in fast track court
 fast trek court main in maamalon ko sunne kaa sabase bada makasad ye he ki ek samay seemaa ke bheetar jald se jald court maamle main apana faisla de paae or peedita ko kam se kam vakt main insaaf mil sake
 Fast track courts give their verdict in these cases related to rape within a few months to one or one and a half years
 haalanki is maamle main kuch apwaad bhi rahe hai jisamen hafte bhar ke bheetar bhi fast trek court ne apane aadesh die hai
 Fast track courts were formed after the Nirbhaya case
 After the Nirbhaya case in Delhi, a fast track court has been set up in every district for the purpose of expeditious hearing in cases related to rape or sexual assault of women
 To do
 haalanki is tarah kii court main har roj kitne maamle sune jaaenge yaa phir kitne din ke bheetar ek jaj ko kisi maamle kii sunwaayee puri kerani he, isko lekar koi samay seemaa tay nahin he
 However, the hearing of such cases is settled much earlier than other cases
 saamaanya rup se kisi bhi mukademe kii sunwaayee puri hone or us par court kaa faisla aane main amuman 5 se 7 saal kaa vakt lag jaataa he
 But the cases in the fast track court are settled between 6 months to one and a half years
 kyonki aise maamalon main zyaadaatar sunwaayee har roj hoti he
 The testimony of witnesses is also being done regularly, that is, neither are getting long dates in these cases, nor does the investigating agency delay in presenting evidence or witnesses on its behalf
 jiske kaaran sunwaayee puri hone main zyada vakt nahin lagata
 That is why the decisions coming from the fast track court also come quickly
 gavaahon par nirbhar he sunwaayeecourt main kisi maamle kii sunwaayee kitni jaldi puri hogi is baat par nirbhar karata he ki us puure maamle main kitne gavaah hai, unki gavaahi kitne samay main puri ho paa rahi he
 How much time is it taking the investigating agency to present the rest of the evidence
 jin maamalon main 100 se upar logon kii gavaahi hoti he or fast trek court ko apana aadesh dene main 2 saal yaa usase zyada kaa vakt bhi lag jaataa he
 On the orders of the Supreme Court, the fast track court of Tis Hazari Court is currently hearing in the Unnao rape case

 The CBI can no longer arrest social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand
 bombai hoicourt ne tista kii agrim jamaanat kii arji manjuur kar lee he
 The big thing is that the High Court rejected the cbi's claim that the activities of Teesta Setalvad and her husband are a threat to the country
 adaalat ne kaha ki kisi bhi naagarik ko alag vichaar rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 Having a different view cannot be a threat to the integrity of the country
 haalanki tista bina adaalat kii ijaajat ke desh ke baahar nahin ja saktin
 Earlier on July 24, the special CBI court rejected Teesta's anticipatory bail application

 The CBI has registered a case under Section 120 of the IPC and FCRA against their Sabrang Communication Trust and Trustees
 july maheene main sibiai ne tista ke ghar or daftar par chapa bhi maaraa tha
 It was argued by Teesta's lawyer that all the documents related to the case have been given to the CBI
 or kai daur kii poochtacha bhi ho chuki he isliye hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Which the court accepted
 badi baat ye ki hoicourt ne sibiai ke us daawey ko khaarij kar diya ki tista sitalwad or unke pati kii gatividhiyaan desh ke liye khatra hai
 The court said that any citizen has the right to have a different view
 alag vichaar rakhana desh kii akhandta ke liye khatra nahin ho saktaa
 However Teesta cannot go outside the country without the permission of the court
 iske pehle 24 july ko sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne tista kii agrim jamaanat kii arji khaarij kar di thi
 Teesta then challenged that decision in the High Court
 jis par adaalat ne tista kii giraftaar par roak lagaate hue unhen sibiai ke saamne puchhatacha ke liye hajir rahane kaa aadesh diya tha
 The comments saamaajik kaaryakarta tista sitalwar or unke pati javed anand par kendriya grih mantralay kii ijaajat ke bina ford foundation se 1
 He is accused of taking Rs 5 crore and then spending it on the wrong item
 sibiai ne unke sabrang communication trust or trustiyon ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 120 or epasiare ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 In July, the CBI also raided Teesta's house and office
 tista ke vakil kii taraf se daleel di gai thi ki maamle se jude sabhi dastavej sibiai ko die ja chuke hai
 And many rounds of questioning have been done, so there is no need for questioning in custody
 jise adaalat ne maan liya

 Let us know on this occasion about the man of history who is known as Timur

 vahi samarkand jahaan se babar aayaa tha
 On the lines of Genghis Khan, Timur also started more destruction than fighting
 inaki policy ko baad main scorchd arth policy kaha gaya
 Meaning do so much destruction that enemies do not rise again
 1393 tak puure mesopotamia yani iraq tak taimur kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 India reached India in 1398, when the name of India was respected in the world
 dhani desh hua karata tha bharat
 Taimur reached close to India in 1398
 multan ko jeeta
 And then a full-fledged attack on India
 13 oktober 1398 ko taimur sindhu, raavi or jhelum ko paar kar bharat main daakhil hua
 After that, Bhatner and Panipat reached Delhi
 taimur 15 din tak yahaan kii sampatti ladata rahaa
 The artisans were taken captive
 inhen kaarigaron se usne apane yahaan jama masjid banavaai thi
 Kathaplanvo went to Meerut to attack China as well
 haridwar tak pahunchaa
 He was accused of looting valuables from here
 jammu tak pahunchaa
 Returned in March 1399
 waapas laut kar usne mahaan automan samrajya ke shaasha ko haraaya
 After that it had a plan to attack China too
 par 1405 main isaki maut ho gai
 However, Timur is known for his military strategy
 ek kushal senapati jisane apane sainikon ko har tarah kii ladaai ke liye taiyaar kiya
 Even prepared for an attack on China
 iske saath hi kai saare cultures ko jodne kaa bhi shrey praapt he taimur ko

 bombai hoicourt dwaara do din pehle giraftaar se antarim raahat dene se inkaar kiye jane ke baad is frod kaarobaari danpati ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 He is accused of grabbing Rs 285 crore from around 2,000 depositors
 iconomic offence wing (EOW) ne kulkarni danpati ke khilaaf cese darj kar rakhaa he
 EOW ACP Nilesh More told Aaj Tak that the Kulkarni couple could be arrested with the help of Delhi Police under the guidance of senior officials

 The fear of government action on fake educational degrees sat in the heart that 1400 primary teachers in Bihar resigned
 aane vaale dinon main or shikshak istipha de sakate hai kyonki patna hai court ne farji shaikshanik yogyata waalon ko kanoonee karrwai se bachane ke liye apane aap hi naukari chhod dene ko kaha tha
 RK Mahajan, Principal Secretary, Education Department, said, "A total of 1400 teachers have resigned
 aise or istife aane kii sambhaavna he kyonki hamane uske liye 8 july kii aakhri taarikh tay kii he
 The final figures of such teachers who resign will be known only after that
 ’mahajan ne kaha ki farji certificate rakhane vaale jo shikshak tay avadhi main istipha nahin dete hai to unke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 An FIR will be lodged against them, their services will be terminated and the government will recover their salary and other allowances

 The state government has already directed the Vigilance Department to check the educational qualification of teachers

 (input language) rajyasabha main april ke baad sankhya ke khel or kisi bhi vidheyak ko rokane ke maamle main vipaksh kii dhar kam ho sakati he
 While the bjp-led NDA may have a much better position than its opponents
 april main 58 rajyasabha sadsy kaa kaarykaal puraa ho rahaa he
 This is bound to change the mathematics of Rajya Sabha
 rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko mili majboot bahumat se rajyasabha chunaav main bhi party ko phayda hoga
 This will increase the seats of BJP and its allies
 isi ke saath, jahaan congress netritv vaale vipaksh kii sankhya 123 se kam hokar kareeb 115 rahane kii sambhaavna he, to vahiin bijepi or uske gathbandhan sahyogiyon or samarthakon kaa kul aankada vartmaan ke 100 se badhkar 109 ho saktaa he
 Let me tell you that there was a time difference between the ruling BJP and the Congress that even after the Modi government passed its bill in Lok Sabha, it used to get stuck in Rajya Sabha
 par ab fark kam ho jayega
 Of the 55 members who have completed the term, 30 belong to the opposition camp, while 24 belong to the BJP and its allies
 unamem se rajg ke kai ummidavaar sadan main waapas lautenge, jabaki vipaksh ke kai sadsy dobaaraa se vaapasi nahin kar paaenge
 The political equation of the Rajya Sabha is that out of the 233 elected members of the House (apart from 12 nominated members) in the current time, the Congress-led opposition has 123 Rajya Sabha members, while the NDA has 83 members (58 of the BJP) and four independent members, who are BJP The supporters are Rajiv Chandrasekhar, Subhash Chandra, Sanjay Dattatreya Kakade and Amar Singh
 iske alaava ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (ediemke), jiske rajyasabha main 13 sadsy hai, ve bhi endie ke saath hai
 In this way 100 members of NDA reach
 bataa den ki kuch maheene pehle tak bijepi kaa ye akda or bhi adhik tha
 In the case of any kind of debate between the government and the opposition regarding the bills and major issues in the Rajya Sabha, the opposition had an upper hand
 halhi main teen talaak vidheyak jo loksabhaa se paas hone ke baad bhi rajyasabha main atak gaya he
 Due to the majority of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Narendra Modi government had to face many cases
 sadan main sangharsh kii sthiti se bachane ke liye use kai baar dhan vidheyak kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Under the Constitution, the money bill needs to be passed only in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha cannot stop it
 april main bijepi kii rajyasabha main badhegi sitembijapi or uske gathbandhan sahyogiyon ke 100 rajyasabha sadasyon main se 24 rajyasabha sadasyon ke kaarykaal puure ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, the NDA will have 76 mps, including AIADMK members
 haalanki bijepi netritv vaale endie ke 30 rajyasabha sadsy nirvaachit hokar aaenge
 In such a situation, this figure will increase to 106
 isamen sarkaar dwaara rajyasabha ke liye namankit kiye jane vaale teen sadasyon ko bhi mila den to rajg sadasyon kaa kul aankada kareeb 109 ho jayega
 Apart from this, there are parties like Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), Bharatiya Rashtriya Lok Dal (INLD) and YSR Congress, which are not completely against the BJP and they do not go against the government unless there is a solid reason
 ghategi congress kii takatcongress sahit vipakshi dalon kii sankhya 123 he
 Out of these, the tenure of 30 Rajya Sabha members is being completed, after which 93 members will be saved
 Out of 30, 22 Rajya Sabha members will be elected
 is tarah april ke baad rajyasabha main vipakshi dalon kii sankhya 115 ho jaaegi
 The three newly elected members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) can maintain the same distance from both the BJP and the Congress, though the AAP has good relations with some major opposition parties like the Trinamool Congress

 bihar main ab loksabhaa chunaav main bhi aarakshan kaa mudda garmane laga he
 There is still two rounds of voting left, but on the issue of reservation, while the Grand Alliance is aggressive, the leaders of the NDA have been giving cleanliness in every election meeting

 Before going to the election campaign, Tejashwi Yadav showed the clipping of this newspaper to the journalists in Patna and said that this news has been published and this proves our allegation that in the coming days, the central government will first go backward castes like Kushwaha Kurmi Dangi and Yadav There is no surprise if the present quota of reservation will be cut and in the future, the Dalits will also gradually end their reservation

 ye log jo pichde hai jaise kurmi, ahir, uske baad ati pichhadon or phir baad main daliton kaa bhi aarakshan khatm kar denge
 This is all the report that has come out that we used to say that there is a danger on reservation and who was talking about saving the Constitution
 yah sabit ho gaya inke kathani or kerani main antar he
 However, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar denies in every meeting that there is any tampering with the reservation or whether any party or coalition will dare to abolish the reservation in future

 This is sad news for those working in Infosys
 bracit kii vajah se royal bank of scotland arabs (rbs)ne bank project radd kar diya he
 Infosys said in a statement - Infosys was W&G technology, application delivery and testing service partner
 ab is faisle ke baad 300 karmchaariyon par iskaa asar padegaa
 The comments darasal, infosis or ibiem ko 5 saal ke liye 30 karod euro kaa arabs kaa project mila tha or is project se infosis ko 20 karod euro milane the
 Now, with the cancellation of this project, Infosys could face a blow of $ 50 million this year
 infosis ne ek statement main kaha- infosis dablyooendji technolji, aplication delivery or testing sarvice partner tha
 Now this decision will have an impact on 300 employees
 tippaniyan Actually, Infosys and IBM got RBS project of 5 million Euros for 5 years and Infosys was to get 200 million Euros from this project
 ab yah project radd hone se is saal infosis ko 5 karod dollar kaa jhatka lag saktaa he

 Pakistan may continue to extend a hand of friendship towards India, but it will never be deterred by its nefarious antics
 jammu-kashmir seemaa par to pakistani sena aae din sijafire todatii rahati he, lekin ab usne bharat ke khilaaf ek nayaa morcha khol diya he
 Pakistan has set up strong towers on the border in violation of international regulations
 bharat ne padosi mulk kii is harakat ke khilaaf shikaayat kii he
 In fact, Pakistan has taken possession of its mobile network on the indo-pak 1055 km border and the range of Pakistani mobile networks has reached 20 to 40 km inside the border of Hindustan
 yani bharat-paak kii rajasthan seemaa ke kai gaanvon or ilaakon main darjanon pakistani mobile companiyon ke signal aasaani se mil jate hai
 These include Pakwalar, Bhurawar, Anandgarh, Khanuwali, of Longowal, Ghotaru, Tanot, Kishangarh, Sultana, Nachna, Bharewala and Bikaner of Jaisalmer
 ke
 The dunes cover the area of kaveri
 sarhad ke paas rajasthan ke bikaner, jaisalmer, barmer or sriganganagar main army or airforce adde hone kii vajah se suraksha agenciyon ke liye pakistan kaa ye nayaa pintara ek bada sirdard ban gaya he
 These areas are receiving signals from companies such as Pakistani mobile companies like Mobalik, pk-ufone, Telenor, Gem, Mobile Telelink, PTCL, JDHA, Alvarid, Paktail, Pak PL and UF1
 aapako bataa den ki doorsanchaar ke antarrashtriya niyamon ke mutabik kisi bhi desh ke mobile yaa landline kaa signal duusare desh main nahin ja saktaa
 For this, mobile towers have to be installed within one and a half kilometers of their border so that the mobile signals do not go more than 500 meters away at the border
 lekin pakistan in saare niyamon ko taak par rakh kar jaanboojh kar seemaa par sidime takanic ke majboot toweron kaa network khadaa karata ja rahaa he
 Yogesh Bhaskar, Telecom District Manager (border Area), says, "this is very dangerous, in this we can monitor the call and neither can trace the SIM
 ye desh ke liye bada khatra he
 For this, the Ministry of Defense has been written, the IB team has also visited
 aise hua khulhasajankaron kii maane to pakistan kii is nai chaal ke peeche uski koi naa koi nai sajeesh he or aane vaale dinon main uskaa ye nayaa pintara bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ke liye yakeenan ek bada sirdard banane vaala he
 Actually, the real motive behind this act of Pakistan came when the SIM cards of Pakistani mobile companies were recovered from Pakistani spies caught by Indian intelligence agencies
 unhone hi is baat kaa khulaasa kiya ki pakistan rajasthan kii seemaa par mobile toweron kaa jaal bicha rahaa he
 According to experts, if a call is made from a Pakistani SIM card and through the signals of Pakistani mobile towers, then Indian security agencies can neither catch it
 naa hi phone karne vaale shaks kii lokation kaa pataa laga sakati hai or naa hi wo uske kol ko ricard kar sakati hai
 As soon as China was helping 'aaj Tak', we confirmed that the signals of Pakistani mobile companies are coming in the border of India
 or jab hamane is bare main padtaal kii to sari hakeekat hamaare saamne aa gai
 According to experts, Pakistan does not have the technology to install mobile towers with such capacity, but then the question arises that if it is installing mobile towers that provide signal so far, then who is helping it in this task
 sutron kii maane to rajasthan seemaa par mobile toweron kaa network khadaa karne main pakistan kii madad china kar rahaa he
 Because China has such technology that it can help Pakistan in its new move
 yogesh bhaskar kehete hai, 'hamane puure border ilaake barmer, bikaner kaa survey kiya he
 There is a lot of signal coming from Pakistan
 telenor or kai companiyaan hai
 In India, these signals are coming up to 20 kilometers, according to me, they are applying CDMA technology, which is giving a strong signal
 20 kimi hamaari seemaa ke bheetar aa rahe hai to us hisaab se 20 kimi pakistan kii seemaa main bhi ja rahe hai yani 40 kimi kii kshamta ke tower lagaae ja rahe hai
 On discovering this new move of Pakistan, the team of IB and BSNL have visited the border area and submitted their full report to the Ministry of Defense and Foreign Ministry
 jaankaron ke mutabik bharat chaah kar bhi pakistani mobile toweron ke signal ko sarhad paar aane se nahin roak saktaa
 Because it is not possible to put a jammer on such a long range
 haalanki bharat pakistan se is babat apana virodh darj karvaa chukaa he lekin pakistan bharat is baat ko darkinar rakh apane plan ko anjaam tak pahunchane main laga hua he
 Humans have been associated with music since time immemorial, music was the medium made by man to express his feelings
 pracheen samay main yah maatr ek manoranjan kaa strot nahin tha
 Many of our sages were accomplished in Muni Shastra
 or aaj bhi kai ucch koti ke yogijan sangeet main purna hote hai 
 Have we even once thought that those who are always in the pleasure of the favorite, what is the need of music through this external entertainment
 sangeet kaa matlab aaj kya liya jaataa he? ye kaha nahin ja saktaa lekin pracheen kaal main ye ek aadhyatmik madhyam hi rahaa tha
 Through music, many people have attained perfection, there are many examples like Meerabai or Narasimha
 to phir yah bhed kyon?vastav main hamane sangeet ko kabhi samajha hi nahin, bhanvare kii gunjan bhi ek prakaar se sangeet hi hai jise roj suna jaye to aadmi dhire dhire vichaar shunya ho jaataa hai
 Music should be based on entertainment for ordinary human beings, but for yogis, music has a very deep definition
 dhwani kii mahatta nirvivaad rup se maani jaati hai or ek vishesh dhwani koi na koi vishesh urja prasaarit karti hi hai 
 There are no common groups of words such as the octaves of music or the words in the poem
 dene ko to in dhvaniyon ko koi bhi uccharan de diya jaataa lekin sa re ga m pa dha ni kaa gahan arth hai 
 When a basic sound is included with a particular rhythm, it vibrates a particular cycle in the body
 sabhi sur apane aapmen tatwon ke pratinidhi hai or har sur ek vishesh tatv ke upar apana prabhutv rakhata hai 
 In which Sa-earth, ray, c-water element, p-fire element are representative of d-air and n-sky element
 ab jis tarah se ye sapt sur hai usee tarah sharir main sapt surikaaye hai jahaan se sur kaa yaa dhwani kii rachana hoti hai 
 This is the head, nose, throat, heart (lungs), navel, pelvis and groin
 dhyaan se dekha jaae to ye sari jagah sharir ke sapt chakron ke atyant hi najadik hai 
 Now in this way, in the musical system, in the Kundalini relation, Sapta Sur is helping to vibrate a cycle
 Mooladhar (earth element, surika-osandhi) Ray - Swadhisthan (water element, Surika - Pedu) Navel) m - Anahata (fire element, surika - heart) p - Vishuddha (fire element, surica - throat) Dh - command (air element, surica - nasal) Ni - Sahastrar (sky element, surica - head) of these vowels, Above mentioned By meditating on the chakra related to them, the process of awakening the chakra starts and he starts having many special experiences
 magar ye chakra jaagran hota hai , bhedan nahin
 That is why Vibhinha ragas are composed, in which a special raga is created by the combination of sounds that can penetrate that particular chakra
 jaise malkosh raag ke madhyam se vishuddh chakra ko jaagrath kiya ja saktaa he , isi prakaar kalyaan raag ke nirantar abhyaas se bhi vishuddh chakra ko spandan praapt hota he or wo jaagrath ho jaataa he
 And once this chakra is awakened, the seeker can feel the waves pervading the atmosphere and convert them into sounds, but singing a raga like kalyan raga is appropriate only in the evening
 arthath surya ast ke turant uparaant
 The Mooladhara Chakra awakens through the Nanda raga
 or vedon kaa sahi arth vyakti tabhi samaj saktaa he jab uskaa muladhar puri tarah jaagrath ho
 This raga should be sung in the second stroke of the night
 thaat bilabal raag devgiri ke prayog se anahath chakra kii jagrati hoti he vyakti anhad naad ko sunne main or uski shaktiyon kii prapti main sakasham ho jaataa he, isi prakaar sabhi raag kisi na kisi chakra ko spandit karte hi hai
 But what, music is only for Kundalini Jagran? No
 sangeet kii shakti se tansen ne deepak raag kaa prayog kar jahaan dipakon ko prajvalit kar diya tha vahi baiju baavare ne sangeet ke ek vishesh raag kaa prayog kar pathar ko pighalaakar usame apana tanpura daal diya tha or raag band kar diya tha jisase kii wo tanpura us pighale hue pathar main hi jam gaya tha
 All these are just a few examples
 Music itself is a complete system
 bramhand ke sabhi padaarth 5 tatv se hi nirmit hai 
 The seven notes of music represent these 5 elements
 sangeet se kisi vishesh sur yaa raag ke madhyam se ham apana vaayu tatv badhaale or bhoomi evam jal tatv ko kam karade to manushya adrashya evam vayugaman siddhi praapt kar letaa hai 
 
 yadi sadhak sahi tareeke se sangeet kaa prayog kare to bahya chizon par yahi prayog karne par vah bhi adrashya ho jayega
 Or change the elements by coinciding with its elements, but its changes are also possible
 yaa phir sangeet ke madhyam se hawa main hi sabandhit koi bhi vastu ke tatwon ko sanyojit kar ke use kuch hi kshanon main praapt kiya ja saktaa hai 
 In fact, music is not just entertainment, our sage Muni was a very high quality scientist but we have never tried to understand

 kya manushya alokik he? haal main hue ek chaunkaanewaale adhyayan se pataa laga he ki anek log bhavishya ko dekh sakate hai
 According to the Daily Mail, researchers led by Daryl Bam of Cornell University have also found that many people have the ability to influence events before they occur
 unka yah adhyayan 1000 swayanseviyon par kiye gayi anek prayogon ke vishleshan par aadhaarit he
 In one experiment, students were shown a list of words to remember
 baad main unase jitne ho saken, utane shabdon ko yaad karne ke liye kaha gaya or iske baad unhen kuch shabdon ko tip karne ke liye apane man se chunaav karne ko kaha gaya
 Some students were better at memorizing some words than others, but surprisingly, these were the same words that they were later asked to type in which meant that a future event caused them to remember Efficiency was affected
 ek anya prayog main vidhyaarthiyon ko ek computer screen par do paradon kii tasviir dikhaayi gayi or bataaya gaya ki inamen se ek main ek kamottejak tasviir chhipi hui he
 Students recognized the screen more often than cannot be avoided by mere coincidence

 After his choice came out, he was shown words like tasteful or dangerous

 Hiralal Alava has demanded a new state

 However, the party considers it to be his personal opinion
 dow alaava kii adivasee yuvaaon main gahari paith he
 He studied MBBS from AIIMS
 chunaav se pehle unhone jais chhod panje ko pakadaa
 Previously angry at not being made a minister, now a separate state is being demanded for the tribals

 However, at present the party is finding it unnecessary to demand a separate state

 Not everyone can be made a minister, but they want to develop as ministers of their area

 The BJP is surrounded by the Congress in this matter and terming it a serious issue
 bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne kaha congress apane hi vidhayak kii maang par kya kahati he
 Just negation will not work
 kya ise hatotsahit karne kaa prayaas congress kar rahi he
 There is no statement of Kamal Nath ji
 ye chota maamla nahin bada maamla he
 However, as soon as the Congress government was formed after the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, before the Lok Sabha elections, political demands of separate Bhil region have also started to be removed
 kahin ye us sandesh ko dene kaa koshish to nahin ki agar adivaasiyon kii andekhi kii to party iskaa khamiyaja loksabhaa chunaav main bhugatne ke liye taiyaar rahe
 'much of the essence that has been invented in the world has come from the power of yoga
 ham yahaan par yoga shabd ko keval bharat kii saadhan-pranali vishesh se seemaabaddh karne kaa vyarth prayaas nahin karenge
 All scientific and philosophical inventions are the result of the concentration tools of yoga
 ' The name of the author is not there, it is just said in the introduction that these living servants are revered Mahatmas
 jivasevak ko dharmasevak nahin kaha gaya he
 Jiva can be of any religion
 1935 main gitapress ne ek visheshank yogank nikaala tha
 This is a very important book to understand the early debates about yoga
 har dharm jeev or ishwar ke bich sidhe sampark kii baat karata he taaki ve dharti par maujuud chizon ke sangrah or swaamitv ke chakkar main bhatakate na rah jaaen
 Essence is not invented only in Hinduism
 har dharm kaa saar he or kai dharmon kaa saar bhi ek hi he
 It has been emphasized in all that, subdue worldly and physical desires, and push yourself on the path of union with God
 mukti or anand vahiin hai
 The uniformity of these essences unites the goal of all religions
 unke bich ekta kaayam karti he
 In the article titled 'what is Yoga', what is the purpose of telling the results of Yoga to all scientific inventions
 vaigyanik avishkaar to duniya bhar main hue hai
 If they are the fruit of yoga, it means that a scientist unaware of our understanding of yoga was engaged in his practice
 yoga kar rahaa tha
 Does this also mean that contribution to yoga also belongs to a scientist who is not an Indian
 vaigyanik avishkaar vaise bharat ke hisse main kam hi aate hai
 Mahatma ji, who has not tried in vain to describe Yoga as the means of India, also says- 'through amulets, armor, etc
, who have the courage to break the karma of people, who would give medicine to Vandhaya to get a son
 Are and talk about curing the disease of patients, they are also called Yogi and worshiped nowadays
 ' In Yogank itself, Param Pujyapada Shri Udiaswamiji Maharaj has written that i discovered a lot of hathayogis from Assam to Bhutan etc
 maine aise kai hathyogi dekhe hai jinhen chaar-chaar ghante kii samadhi hoti thi parantu unki vaastavik sthiti kaa pataa lagane par yahi vidit hua ki unamem se kisi ko bhi samadhi siddh nahin hui he
 i have also found all the hathayogis to be patients
 unamem dhyaan or vairaygy kii kami he isliye aadhunik hathyogi praaia: arthlolup or chanchal prakruti ke dekhe jate hai
 Even in the idealistic era of 1935, these scholars were worrying over the decline of yoga and yogis
 ve kyon chaahate the ki yogi dhan sanchayi or chamatkaari na ho
 Apparently, he was cheated in the name of yoga and was suffering from recovery
 aaj jab 2015 ke saal main yoga par dainik charchaaen ho rahi hai to kya ham aise sawaalon se takaraa rahe hai? hamane maan liya he ki yoga main sab thik he
 Yoga is fine, but do those who practice it follow the limits of yoga? aaj channelon par hindu banaam muslim ke daayre main yoga ko lekar bahes ho rahi he kyonki isse raajnneeti sadhti he
 While reading the 680 pages issue of 'kalyan', i did not think that any Swami, some Mahatma are making such a claim, why is this feeling today
 ve yoga ko dharmavishesh ke chashme se bhi nahin dekhte
 In 1935, Gitapress can score on the world of yoga, so why are we afraid of whom today
 yoga darpok nahin banaata he
 Yoga does not subject you to any party
 yoga ke naam par kisi dharmik raajnneetik vichaardhaara kaa propeganda nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Yoga does not originate from any of the pages of books on modern understanding of religion
 'yogi sarp, mechak aadi jantuon se asana, mudra, pranayam aadi yogankon ko sikhkar apane swasthya or aayu kii vruddhi karne main samarth hue the
 It is well known that the ancient sages, Jesus and other Mahatmas have the ability to cure diseases of patients with the power of yoga
 yogabal ke sadhak irshyaa-dwesh, sukh-dukh, shatru-mitra se dur hokar shantchitt hokar kis prakaar prithvi par shanti rajya sthapit karne main sahaayak hue the iske jwalanth udhaaharan hai- shankar, isamsih, buddha ityadi
 (page 73)
 ' Today, an attempt is being made to link yoga with Hinduism by stating the identity of Indianness
 pehle hindutv or bhartiyata ko ek kaha gaya ab yoga ke bahaane bhartiyata kii baat ho rahi he
 Whereas yoga has never claimed that it will be a means to maintain or preserve one's power
 hamen poochna chahie ki kya ham yoga ke swaroop ko jaanate hai
 Surprising everyone by running a hashtag on Twitter or performing one or two asanas of hatha yoga is not the sum
 yoga ko lekar kitni sarthak darshanik bahes ho sakati thi lekin ise asana ke package main badal diya gaya he
 The Yogi is seen performing the same miracle whose warning by the Mahatmas considering Yoga has been issued from time to time
 kya yoga ko tamaam paramparaon se alag kiya ja rahaa he? There is an article in this issue of 'kalyan' - Place of Christianity
 reverand edwin greebj ne likhaa he
 In Christianity too, there has been a strong emphasis on being united with God
 greebj likhte hai ki upadesh kaary armbh karte samay isamsih ne chalis din kaa upwas kiya tha aisa varnan miltaa he, kintu unhone is tap ko kisi saadhan ke rup main kiya ho aisa maaloom nahin hota, balki kuch samay tak vah akele jangal main rahe or vahaan apane bhavi upadesh kaary kii soch main itane tallin hue ki unhen khaane-pine kii sud na rahi
 There is a long debate in Christianity over the notion of yoga
 hamaare mahatmaon ne bhi is par khub charchaa kii he lekin kya is udaartaa kaa zaraa sa bhi lakshan maujuuda daur main dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Kabir Yoga is mentioned in this issue
 vahi kabir jinhone hindu or musalmaan ke naam par alag-alag hone ko lekar kitna tanj kiya he
 There is also an article on Buddhism, Jain Yoga in detail
 saare yoga kaa mul arth or uski antim parinti bhagwaan ke saath prem milan main he
 So did Sufi yogis not become so
 namaazi yogi nahin hua yaa islam main yoga nahin hua
 Is the method of yoga just asana
 mere khyaal se yoga kaa isse zyaada sankuchit rup nahin ho saktaa
 In the Yogank of 'kalyan', there is an article by Mr
 h Jehangir Toraporwala who seeks Yoga in Zoroastrian religion
 parsi dharm main bhi gyaan, bhakthi or karm ke jo maarg bataaye gaye hai wo yoga ke hi hai, bhale hi hamaare bache hue granthon main yoga shabd kaa istamaal nahin hua ho
 What is the philosophy that does not change from one form to another religion? wo log koun the jo sabhi dharmon kaa saar ek ishwar kii prapti main dekhte rahe or bataa gaye ki ishwar ek he
 Who are these people who are engaged in telling the God of all religions differently
 meraa matlab yah bhi nahin ki yoga bhartiya nahin he, yoga kii kalpana bina bhartiya darshan or siddhanton ke nahin kii ja sakati lekin ham yoga kii vividhta par baat kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Yoga does not make you religious
 balki karmkaandon se mukt kar apane bheetar paramatma ke darshan karne kii shakti detaa he
 You cannot achieve that power by watching TV or watching a CD made by a yogi
 sadhana or samadhi kii baat kyon nahin hoti he
 Yoga also means to attain the awakened levels of consciousness
 maharishi aravind ne likhaa he ki koi manushya kabhi is maarg par pair na rakhe jisko yah nishchay na ho ki hamaare antaratma kii yah pukaar he or is maarg par ant tak chalane kii hamaari taiyaari he
 The comments 'main yani yah chota ahankaar prakruti kii rachana he or saath hi maansik, prangat or bhautik rachana bhi he
 When the soul is found, then the work of the ego is completed, then it is of no use
 ant ho jaataa he
 ' maharishi aravind ke yah vichaar unki pustak 'lits of yoga' se lekar 'kalyaan' ne chapa he
 Today every other yogi who talks about yoga suffers from me
 yoga kaa jhanda lekar ghoomane vaale rajanetaaon ko main kaa rog laga hua he
 Obviously they will be proficient in rugs but not in yoga ideas
 yoga kahaan nahin he
 Is in grammar, mathematics and construction
 hydrogen or oxigen ke milane main bhi yoga he
 How many things are made by mixing wood with wood is also there
 isliye yoga kii vyapaktaa ko aap kisi dal yaa kisi dharm kii pahchaan se mat jodiye
 Do yoga, but not only to relieve belly fat, but also to know the soul and the divine
 lekhak kaa naam nahin he, parichay main bas itnaa kaha he ki ye jivasevak pratishthatyagi mahatma hai
 The Jeeva Sevak is not called a Dharm Sevak
 jeev kisi bhi dharm kaa ho saktaa he
 In 1935, Geetapress drew a special sum
 yoga ko lekar aarambhik bahason ko samajhane ke liye yah bahut zaruri kitaab he
 Every religion speaks of a direct contact between the living being and God so that they do not go astray in the collection and ownership of things on earth
 saratatv kaa avishkaar sirf hindu dharm main nahin hua he
 Every religion has its essence and many religions have the same essence
 sabhi main is par jor diya he ki sansaarik or shaareerik laalasaaon ko vash main kar khud ko paramatma ke milan ke maarg par jhonk do
 Liberation and bliss are there
 inhen saar-tatwon kii ekarupata sabhi dharmon ke lakshya ko ek karti he
 Unity is established between them
 'yoga kya he' sheershak lekh main samast vaigyanik avishkaron ko yoga kaa fal bataane kaa kya makasad he
 Scientific inventions have taken place all over the world
 agar ve yoga kaa fal hai to iskaa matlab yah hua ki hamaari samaj vaale yoga se anjaan koi vaigyanik apni sadhana main laga hua tha
 Was doing yoga kya iskaa matlab yah bhi hua ki yoga main yogadan us vaigyanik kaa bhi he jo bhartiya nahin he
 Scientific inventions are rarely in India
 yoga ko bharat kii saadhan-pranali bataane kaa vyarth prayaas nahin karne vaale mahatma ji yah bhi kehete hai- 'tabeez, kavach, aadi ke dwaara jo logon ke karmfal kaa khandan karne kii himakat rakhte hai, jo vandhaya ko putr prapti ke liye dawa dete hai or rogiyon kaa rog dur karne kii baat karte hai, ve bhi aajkal yogi kahe jate hai or poojit hote hai
 ' yogank main hi parampujyapad shriudiyaswamiji maharaj ne likhaa he ki maine assam se bhutan aadi praanton main hathyogiyon kii bahut khoj kii
 i have seen many Hathayogis who used to have samadhi of four hours, but on discovering their actual condition, it was known that none of them has been proved to be samadhi
 maine praaia sabhi hathyogiyon ko rogi bhi paaya he
 They lack attention and quietness, so modern Hathayogi are often seen as economical and playful in nature
 1935 ke adarshavaadi daur main bhi ye vidwaan yoga or yogiyon ke patan par chintaa kar rahe the
 Why did they want yogi wealth not cumulative and miraculous
 zaahir he unhen yoga ke naam par thagi or vasuuli se pidaa ho rahi thi
 Today, in the year of 2015, when there are daily discussions on yoga, are we hitting on such questions? We have assumed that everything is fine in yoga
 yoga to thik he hi lekin uskaa abhyaan bataane vaale kya yoga kii maryaada kaa paalan karte hai? Today, Yoga is being debated on the channels of Hindu vs Muslim because it helps politics
 'kalyaan' ke 680 pannon ke ank ko padhate hue mujhe kahin nahin laga ki koi swami, koi mahatma aisi daavedaari kar rahe hai, aaj kyon aisa lag rahaa he
 They do not even see yoga through the spectacles of theology
 1935 main gitapress yoga ke vishwaroop par ank nikaal saktaa he to aaj ham kyon or kisase bhaybheet hai
 Yoga does not make a coward
 yoga aapako kisi dal ke adheen nahin karata he
 No religious political ideology should be propagated in the name of yoga
 yoga kii utpatti dharm kii aadhunik samaj par chhapi kitabon ke kisi bhi panne se nahin hoti he
 'yogis were able to increase their health and age by learning yogas like postures, postures, pranayam etc
 from snakes, frogs, etc
 pracheen rishiyon kii, isa aadi mahatmaon kii yogabal se rogiyon ke rog dur karne kii baat prasiddh hi he
 There are vivid examples of how the yogic seekers helped to establish peace and peace on earth by being jealous, malice, happiness and sorrow, away from enemy and friend - Shankar, Jesus, Buddha etc
 “( pej- 73)
 ' aaj yoga ko bhartiyata kii pahchaan bataate hue hindutv se jodne kaa prayaas ho rahaa he
 Hindutva and Indianism were first called one, now Indianness is being talked about on the pretext of yoga
 jabaki yoga kaa kabhi daawa nahin rahaa ki wo kisi kii satta ko banaae yaa bachaae rakhane ke liye saadhan banegaa
 We should ask if we know the nature of yoga

 i also do not mean that Yoga is not Indian, Yoga cannot be imagined without Indian philosophy and principles, but why are we not talking about the diversity of Yoga
 yoga aapako dharmik nahin banaata he
 Rather, it frees us from rituals and gives us the power to see God within ourselves

 Essence is not invented only in Hinduism
 har dharm kaa saar he or kai dharmon kaa saar bhi ek hi he
 It has been emphasized in all that, subdue worldly and physical desires, and push yourself on the path of union with God
 mukti or anand vahiin hai
 The uniformity of these essences unites the goal of all religions

 In the article titled 'what is Yoga', what is the purpose of telling the results of Yoga to all scientific inventions
 vaigyanik avishkaar to duniya bhar main hue hai
 If they are the fruit of yoga, it means that a scientist unaware of our understanding of yoga was engaged in his practice
 yoga kar rahaa tha
 Does this also mean that contribution to yoga also belongs to a scientist who is not an Indian
 vaigyanik avishkaar vaise bharat ke hisse main kam hi aate hai

 What is the philosophy that does not change from one form to another religion? wo log koun the jo sabhi dharmon kaa saar ek ishwar kii prapti main dekhte rahe or bataa gaye ki ishwar ek he
 Who are these people who are engaged in telling the God of all religions differently
 meraa matlab yah bhi nahin ki yoga bhartiya nahin he, yoga kii kalpana bina bhartiya darshan or siddhanton ke nahin kii ja sakati lekin ham yoga kii vividhta par baat kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Yoga does not make you religious
 balki karmkaandon se mukt kar apane bheetar paramatma ke darshan karne kii shakti detaa he
 You cannot achieve that power by watching TV or watching a CD made by a yogi
 sadhana or samadhi kii baat kyon nahin hoti he
 Yoga also means to attain the awakened levels of consciousness
 maharishi aravind ne likhaa he ki koi manushya kabhi is maarg par pair na rakhe jisko yah nishchay na ho ki hamaare antaratma kii yah pukaar he or is maarg par ant tak chalane kii hamaari taiyaari he
 The comments 'main yani yah chota ahankaar prakruti kii rachana he or saath hi maansik, prangat or bhautik rachana bhi he
 When the soul is found, then the work of the ego is completed, then it is of no use
 ant ho jaataa he

 Today every other yogi who talks about yoga suffers from me
 yoga kaa jhanda lekar ghoomane vaale rajanetaaon ko main kaa rog laga hua he
 Obviously they will be proficient in rugs but not in yoga ideas
 yoga kahaan nahin he
 Is in grammar, mathematics and construction
 hydrogen or oxigen ke milane main bhi yoga he
 How many things are made by mixing wood with wood is also there
 isliye yoga kii vyapaktaa ko aap kisi dal yaa kisi dharm kii pahchaan se mat jodiye
 Do yoga, but not only to relieve belly fat, but also to know the soul and the divine
 us shakti ko aap tivi dekhakar yaa kisi yogi kii banaai sidi dekhakar hasil nahin kar sakate hai
 Why is there no question of sadhana and samadhi
 yoga kaa arth chetana ke jaagrit staron ko bhi hasil karnaa he
 Maharishi Arvind has written that no man should ever set foot on this path, who is not sure that this is the call of our conscience and we are ready to walk on this path till the end

 ' This idea of maharishi Arvind has been published from his book 'lights of Yoga' to 'kalyan'

 In such a view, according to that constituencies had the BJP in elections in 2019 switch to 62 parliamentary seats won by the party 274 seats

 However, there were 30 Lok Sabha seats in the state, under which the opposition parties could not open their account in any of the assembly seats
 vahiin, sapa-basapa milakar chunavi maidan main utre the
 Of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the alliance had to settle for 15 seats
 isamen sapa ko paanch siten mili he to basapa ke khate main 10 siten ain hai
 Akhilesh Yadav may have managed to win five seats from this alliance, but if we compare these results with the assembly seat, then his graph seems to be going down
 gathbandhan ke tahat sapa 37 loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladi thi, jinamein se paanch siten hi jeet saki he
 If you see these results according to the assembly seat, then it has won only 45 seats
 jabaki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa 47 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 In this way, Akhilesh Yadav has lost 2 assembly seats
 vahiin, 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mayawati kaa akhilesh yadav se haath milakar chunaav ladanaa phaayde kaa sauda rahaa
 The BSP contested 38 seats under the alliance and managed to win 10 Lok Sabha seats

 If you look at the 10 Lok Sabha seats won by the BSP according to the assembly seat, then it has won 65 seats
 jabaki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav basapa ko mahaj 19 siten mili thi
 In this way, the BSP was in advantage of 46 seats
 apana dal (es) kaa bijepi se gathbandhan kar chunaav ladanaa phaayde kaa sauda rahaa
 She contested two seats and managed to win on both
 apana dal (es) ko mili do loksabhaa siton ko agar vidhansabha kshetra ke lihaaj se dekhen to 9 siton par use badhat mili he
 In the 2017 assembly elections, it got only 9 seats
 congress is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj ek seat hi jeet saki he
 If you look at it in terms of assembly constituency, then it was ahead in 8 seats
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke 7 vidhayak jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 In this year's Lok Sabha elections, Sonia Gandhi has won all the five assembly seats of Rae Bareli
 jabaki amethi main rahul gandhi ko mahaj ek vidhansabha seat par jeet mili or baaki chaar siton par bijepi kii smriti irani kii jeet mili he
 Apart from this, Raghuraj Pratap Singh's Jansatta Party could not win a single Lok Sabha seat in the state, but in two assembly seats it has got more votes than other parties

 He said that the Modi government is intent on passing a bill which is against the wishes of majority of the northeast's majority citizens
 aise main mere pita ke liye is puraskaar kii ghoshnaa bemaani he or isamen mujhe puraskaar dene jaisi bhaavana najar nahin aati
 He wrote on social media, "it seems as if an attempt is being made to force a law against the wishes and interests of the majority population which seems to be broadly unconstitutional, undemocratic and non-indian
" ''vidheyak loksabhaa main paas ho chukaa he or ab pradarshnakariyon kii najar rajyasabha par tiki he jahaan is vidheyak ke atakane kii ummid he
 The Center made efforts to present the bill on February 12 and 13, despite threatening to pull out of the alliance of allies in Meghalaya and the repeal of the bill in the upper house of two BJP chief ministers of Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh

 According to BJP sources, party president Amit Shah pushed the bill forward to please the RSS
 sangh ke liye yah vidheyak avibhajit hindu raashtra kii disha main ek mahatvapurn kadam he
 The party knew that with the introduction of the bill there is a danger of losing its support in the Northeast
 lekin is kshetra main ho rahe virodh pradarshnon ke prati bhaajapa itani udasin rahi, uske peeche ek badi vajah he—rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) ke masaude ke baad naagarikta suchi se baahar rah gaye logon kii dharmik prishthbhumi or assam kii nai janasankhyikeey sanrachana

 "around 12 lakh Hindus are expected to stay out of NRC after claims and objections," he says
 unhen naagarikta dene se assam ko muslim bahul rajya banane se rokane main madad milegi
 "the main reason behind Sarma's belief is that Assamese speakers, who are most opposed to the bill, are no longer in a decisive position to decide the outcome of elections in any of the 14 Lok Sabha constituencies of the state
" bhaajapa ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, ''yahaan tak ki tathakthith asamiya bahul do nirvachan kshetron—dibrugarh or jorhat—main bhi bengaaliyon, marwariawon, bihariyon, nepaliyon or chaay kii kheti karne vaali janajatiyon ne sankhya main asamiya matadaataaon ko peeche chhod diya he

 Input: IANS abhinayta salmaan khan ne us raat sharaab nahin pi thi
 Ravinder Patil, a soldier posted under Salman's security, also did not mention alcohol in his first statement
 salmaan sharaab pie hue the ye baat uske baad ke bayaan main ai
 The police did this intentionally
 mukhya jaanch adhikari ne bade afasaron ko khush karne ke liye kiya or sharaab kii kahani gadhi taaki salmaan par dhara 304(2) lagaai ja sake
 Shrikant Shivde, the counsel of Salman Khan, an accused in the case, on Wednesday pointed out several flaws in the police story one by one in the court
 bachaav paksh ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki us raat hotel main salmaan khan ne hotel main sharaab parosane ke liye kaha hi nahin tha
 a witness himself has given the statement that his friend placed the order
 police ne sharaab kaa farji bill banwaaya
 Even the report of the Chemical Analyst has been fabricated
 bachaav paksh ne ye bhi sawaal uthaaya ki salmaan khan kaa finger print kyon liya gaya tha jab use saboot ke taur par nahin dikhaanaa tha
 According to Salman's lawyer, the finger print report was not in favor of the police and hence the report was not brought before the court
 je dablue marriyat main vaile parking tag ke gum hone or salmaan khan kii gaadi us raat jis vaile dryver ne park kii thi, uskaa bayaan naa lene par bhi sawaal uthaate hue bachaav paksh ne daawa kiya ki police kii jaanch main shuru se hi kai kaamiyaan thi
 For example, the police constable Ravindra Patil has said in his statement that when Salman was in the driver seat in JW Marriott, i asked him if you were driving
 The defense has argued that Ravindra Patil has not said so in his statement that Salman was drunk and that is why he asked
 usne ye sawaal salmaan se isaliye kiya tha kyonki gaadi chalaane ke liye dryver maujuud tha
 The bills of Rain Bar submitted as evidence in court are fake
 is cese ke mukhya jaanch adhikari kishan shangal ne usame chhedchhad kii he
 Eyewitness and injured witness named Mannu Khan has told the court that during the statement made under section 164 of crpc before his magistrate, the police showed his written statement to the magistrate and later took his signature on it
 gavaah ne kaha he ki use pataa nahin tha ki us statement main baaten likhi hui hai wo sahi hai yaa galat
 According to the defense, the government has neither produced any such evidence nor has any witness directly stated that Salman had drunk on the night of the incident
 is cese ke pehle jaanch adhikari ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki unke jaanch chhodane tak salmaan giraftaar nahin hue the
 But Salaman was arrested on 28th at 11 am and the first investigating officer left the investigation on 29th
 phir jaanch adhikari ne ye baat court se kyon chipaayi
 According to Salman's lawyer, he did not want to answer Salman Khan's blood storage and other questions, that's why he said so
 itnaa hi nahin jeje aspataal main salmaan ke aane kaa vaqt 2
 25 is written and time to leave is 2
 30 likhaa gaya he
 According to the doctor's statement, Salman's BP was also checked in these five minutes, a respiratory test was done, blood was extracted and Salman was also seen walking
 paanch minute main ye saare test sambhav nahin hai
 These tests were not done by Salman
 bachaav paksh kaa aarope he ki doctor ne jhooth bolaa he
 Salman hit and run case is in its final round
 bachaav paksh kii jirah ke baad adaalat faisle kii taarikh muqarrar kar sakati he
 Salman Khan is accused that in the year 2002, in the intoxication of alcohol, he drove a laborer sleeping on the pavement in Bandra

 Page has been revealed to have been a member of white supremacist groups and music bands for a long time
 lekin yah abhi tak pataa nahin chal paaya he ki uske hinsaatmak vyavhaar kaa kya kaaran tha
 Was it a purposeless shootout, or did he feel that he was attacking the 'muslims', or was it really the Sikhs who were targeting him? pej ke nishane par 'sikh' the yaa 'musalmaan' yah saaf ho jaataa he to bhi sikh samudaay ko isse khaas raahat nahin milegi

 Amardeep Singh, director of programs at the New York-based Sikh Coalition, says, "for the past 11 years, the popular news media has been flooded with news related to terrorism, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban

 He recalls that even during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, Sikhs were mistakenly considered Iranian and resentment erupted
 amardip bataate hai, ''unhone sikhon ko ayatulla khumaini se jod liya tha isliye mere pita se iran waapas chale jane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 According to Rajwant Singh, president of the Washington-based Sikh Council of Religion and Education (SCORE), nearly half of Sikh men in America have adopted the traditional turban and beard
 iske vipareet america kaa koi musalmaan pagadi nahin pahentaa
 As Harvinder Kaur Kochhar, vice-president of the Philadelphia Sikh Society, says, "it is a simple matter, 99 turban-wearers in America
 9 fisadi log sikh hai, ve musalmaan nahin hai
 "arguing separation from Muslims is a more awkward situation for Sikh groups
" rajvant spasht karte hai, ''ham har vakt yahi ghoshnaa nahin karte rah sakate ki ham muslim nahin hai
 That means, follow the Muslims
 par ham aisa nahin kahana chaahate
 "sikh groups say that they often collaborate with Muslim groups to combat any form of prejudice and hatred

 Rajwant says that despite becoming the Sikh Prime Minister in India and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's state visit to the White House in 2009, there has been no awareness of Sikhs in America
 unka maananaa he ki yah traasadee ''sabak sikhaane vaala kshan'' ban sakati he
 Says Amardeep, "in the last two days, i had not seen as much news as i have seen about Sikhs, about our heritage and background
" haalanki jarurat isse bhi sau guna zyada kii he

 Flamboyant batsman Glean Maxwell has also managed to score a century after Australian captain Steve Smith in the Ranchi Test
 smith ne jahaan match main pehle din shatak banaaya tha vahiin maxwell ne duusare din shatak puraa kiya
 Originally considered an expert player in the short format, Maxwell has proved through this century that he has the passion to succeed in Test cricket as well
 maxwell ke test kariyar kaa yah pehla shatak he
 This is the fourth test of Maxwell's career
 tippaniyan Maxwell has claimed a regular place in the Australian Test team with a century against Team India in Ranchi
 is pari ke dauraan maxwell or team india ke ballebaaj karun nair ke bich ajeeb samanta saamne ai
 In fact, the Test scores of Maxwell and Nair, which is the highest score in cricket, have not been able to make the same number of runs, including the rest of their innings
 pehle baat, ranchi main shatak banane vaale maxwell kii
 'maxi' scored 104 runs in the first innings of this test
 unhen leg spinner rabindra jadeja ne wicketiper saaha ke haathon kaich karaayaa
 Excluding this score of 104 runs, Maxwell's total of six innings in the remaining three tests is 80 runs
 duusare shabdon main kahen to maxwell ne ranchi main jitne ran banaae, utane ran ve apane teen test kii chah pariyon main milakar bhi nahin bana paae
 Maxwell, who made his Test debut in Hyderabad (march 2013) against India, scored 13 runs and 8 runs in his first test
 dilli ke apane duusare test main unka score 10 or 8 ran rahaa
 Maxwell played his third Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in which he scored 37 and 4 runs
 ranchi test ke duusare din kii shuruyaat maxwell ke liye naatakeey si rahi
 His bat broke on Umesh Yadav's first ball of the day
 team india ke navdith ballebaaj karun nair kii sthiti bhi maxwell kii tarah hi he
 Karun scored the highest score of his Test career in the Chennai Test as a triple century against England

 naabad 303 ran kii unki sarvocch pari ko chhod diya jaae to shesh chaar pariyon main unki ran sankhya kaa jod 43 ran
 
 ji haa mahaj 43 ran rahaa
 In this match, which started his Test career in Mohali against England, scored 4 runs (no chance of batting in the second innings)
 mumbai test kii ek pari main unhone 13 ran banaae 
 After scoring 303 * against England in the Chennai Test, he got a chance in the Bengaluru Test against Australia in which he scored 26 runs in the first innings and was dismissed (0) in the second innings
 ranchi main team india ke khilaaf shatkeey pari se maxwell ne australian test team main niyamit sthaan banane kaa daawa pesh kiya he
 During this innings, a strange resemblance between Maxwell and Team India batsman Karun Nair was revealed
 darasal, maxwell or nair kaa jo test cricket kaa sarvocch score he, utani ransankhya ye donon ballebaaj apni baaki kii sari pariyon ko milakar bhi nahin bana paae hai
 First, Maxwell's century in Ranchi
 'maxi' ne is test kii pehali pari main 104 ran kii pari kheli
 He was caught by leg-spinner Ravindra Jadeja at the hands of wicketkeeper Saha
 104 ran ke is score ko alag kar den to maxwell kaa shesh teen test kii chah pariyon kaa jod 80 ran he
 In other words, Maxwell did not score as many runs as he scored in Ranchi, including six innings of his three tests
 bharat ke khilaaf hyderabad (march 2013) main test debyue karne vaale maxwell ne apane pehle test main 13 ran or 8 ran banaae the

 The start of the second day of the Ranchi Test was dramatic for Maxwell
 din kii pehali hi gend par umesh yadav kii tej gend par unka balla tut gaya
 The position of Team India's debutant batsman Karun Nair is similar to that of Maxwell
 karun ne apane test kariyar kaa sarvocch score chennai test main england ke khilaaf tihare shatak ke rup main banaaya tha
 Karun scored an unbeaten 303 in this match
 ranchi main karun apana paanchvaan test khel rahe hai
 Leaving his highest innings of 303 not out, his run number add up to 43 runs in the remaining four innings

 She was very ill at the time
 usne bataaya ki vah apane bachche ko dhundhane kii koshish kar rahi he, ek thane se duusare thane ja rahi he, magar use koi madad nahin mil rahi
 He told that he does not even know if his child is alive or not

 The SHO also assured him of action
 police ne jald se jald ek team kaa gathan kiya or 2 din main bachche ko dilli ke khajuri ilaake se dhund nikaala
 In fact, the child's father sold the 11-month-old child to a husband and wife who had no child
 uski patni bahut biimaar thi or vah bachche kii dekhbhaal nahin kar saktaa tha isliye usne aisa kiya
 After 2-3 months, when he went to get the baby back, he could not find those people

 The parents of the child continued to search for them with their best efforts, they also approached the Delhi Police, but no action was taken, but now with the efforts of the Delhi Women's Commission, the child was properly reunited with her parents
 iske baad bachche ko bal kalyaan samiti ke samaksh pesh kiya gaya or kaagazi karrwai ke baad bachche ko uske asli mata-pita ko saunpa gaya
 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal said that it was very sad to see a mother whose baby was lost and she felt very helpless during the Women's Safety Tour
 kyonki koi bhi uske khoye hue bachche ko dhundhane ke liye uski madad nahin kar rahaa tha
 At our request, the SHO of Shahabad Dairy immediately located the child
 main unke is prayaas ke liye unako badhai detii hum
 The purpose of my 13-day padyatra was to reach out to the people and extend the services of the Commission to them

 pad kaa naam:chaparasi kam house kiparumr seemaa:18-28 salyogyata:10 veen paszyada jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen The court, hearing the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack case, on Monday lashed out at the prosecution and the investigating agency for presenting 'suspicious' and 'weak' evidence against the accused Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed
 kamjor sabooton ke chalate hi ve is maamle se bari ho gaye
 In a 1600-page judgment, the court said "the evidence of the sole prosecution witness is questionable and unreliable
" jaanch agency donon (fahim tathaa sabauddin) ke khilaaf thos saboot uplabdh karaane main vifal rahi’
 The court acquitted Faheem and Sabauddin on May 3, giving them the benefit of doubt
 gavaah nuruddin shaikh ne adaalat main gavaahi di thi ki vah tathaa ek anya vyakti bharat thakur janvari 2008 main nepal kii yatra par gaye the jahaan unhone dekha ki ansaari ne kathmando ke ek guestaouse main mumbai ke thikaanon ke nakshe sabauddin ko saunpe
 According to the prosecution, these maps were used by Pakistani militants including Ajmal Kasab and one such map was found in the paint pocket of slain militant Abu Ismail
 adaalat ne apane aadesh main kaha, ‘shaikh ne apni nepal yatra or vahaan rahane ke bare main koi dastaveji saboot nahin pesh kiya
 The witness had admitted that a record of people entering Nepal is kept on the Sanoli border
 lekin vah koi pravesh parchi pesh karne main vifal rahaa
 The investigating agency did not make any attempt to find this evidence nor did it think it necessary to bother to investigate whether Sheikh had gone to Nepal or not
 adaalat ne kaha ‘abhiyojan paksh ne shaikh ke sabooton kii padtaal ke liye bharat thakur se bhi poochtacha nahin kii
 The prosecution's assertion that Thakur is not being detected is also a weak argument and does not affect the court '
 adaalat ne saath hi yah bhi kaha ki fahim or sabauddin ke khilaaf abhiyojan paksh ke maamle ko sabit karne ke liye thakur mahatvapurn gavaahon main se ek tha
 The court accepted Faheem's counsel RB Mokashi's argument that there were no spots or blood stains on the map found from Ismail's body
 nyaayadhish tahiliyani ne kaha, ‘mere vichaar se, yadi maanchitr itane lambey samay se ismail kii jeb main rahata to vastav main uski haalat kaaphi kharaab ho chuki hoti
 This evidence is highly doubtful '
 adaalat ne kaha ki fahim or sabauddin ko 26 / 11 hamalaa maamle se jodne ke liye abhiyojan paksh dwaara saunpe gaye sabhi saboot ‘sandehaaspad or daagdar’ paae gaye hai

 According to sources, Amarinder Singh had made it clear in front of the party leadership that due to Navjot Singh Sidhu, the party has suffered a lot in Punjab as well as other states
 ab party ko siddhu ke bare main sochna hoga
 In the latest development, Sidhu did not attend the first meeting of the Punjab cabinet after the Lok Sabha elections
 phir mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne mantriyon ke vibhaag main pherbadal karte hue mahatvapurn sthaneey nikaay vibhaag siddhu se le liya
 Now he has been given the responsibility of the Department of Electricity and New and Renewable Energy
 is badlaav ke baad siddhu ne kaha ki kuch log mujhe party se baahar nikaalnaa chaahate hai
 He is being unfairly blamed for the Congress' poor performance
 jo galat he
 Where did the collective responsibility go
 sirf mere khilaaf hi karrwai kyon kii ja rahi he
 Why no action is being taken against the remaining ministers
 siddhu ne kaha ki ve hameshaa se behatar parformar rahe hai
 Significantly, the Congress won 8 of the 13 seats in Punjab
 ab siddhu ke raajnneetik kariyar kaa kya hoga?siddhu ne cricket se sanyas lene ke baad camentry shuru kii
 In this work too, he made his own style

 iske baad siddhu kapil sharma ke kamedi sho kaa hissaa bane
 He also earned a lot of name in this work
 lekin baad main isse bhi unhen hatana padaa
 As far as Sidhu's political career is concerned, first he remained in BJP for many years
 2004 main ve amritsar loksabhaa seat se saansad chune gaye
 Then he left the BJP and joined the Congress
 congress main shaamil hone ke baad unhen punjab cabinet main jagah mili
 Now they too are isolated

 However Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi like Sidhu in the party
 rahul ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan siddhu ko prachaar ke liye amethi or bhopal bheja
 But Rahul Gandhi lost from Amethi and Digvijay Singh from Bhapal
 aise main party siddhu ko kitna tavajjo detii he yah to vakt hi batayega

 There he hugged the Pakistan Army Chief
 iske baad siddhu bharat main chaaron ore se ghir gaye
 BJP fiercely attacked his visit to Pakistan
 itnaa hi nahin bhaajapa ne is mudde par congress par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 Even then Sidhu had split up in the party and said that it was not his political journey but a personal journey
