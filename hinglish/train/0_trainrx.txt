 'akaash, tivi band kar do, aap kai ghanton se tivi dekh rahe ho
 Preeti shouted loudly
 'nahin, meri favorit movie chal rahi he or main ise dekhnaa chahta hum', maa kii baat ko ansuna karte hue akaash ne kaha
 'turn off the TV immediately and clean the room'
 maa ne is baar zyada chillaakar kaha lekin akaash par koi asar nahin hua or usne bhi palatakar jawaab diya- nahin, main movie dekhuunga, abhi
 Akash managed to watch TV and his mother fretted and resumed her work
 yah keval ek maa kii kahani nahin he balki kai maa aisi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana roj karti hai
 They do not see any way how to get their children to talk, what should they do that their children start listening to them
 thakaan, pareshaani or chidchidahat, jhallahat or niraashaa vaala anubhav jo kai maanon ko har din jhelana padataa he
 Let's know some simple tips that will make your child listen to you and listen to you - 1-get the attention of the child-do you want your child to listen to you? So first try to get their attention
 jab ve aap par dhyaan denge tabhi aapaki baat sun paaenge
 You have only one voice for them, what you say does not matter to them
 to sawaal uthta he ki aap apane bacchon kaa atension kaise paaengi?jab aap apane bachche se kuch kah rahi hon to becoground main kisi bhi tarah kaa shor nahin hona chahie
 Remove TV, music, video games, toys, etc
 bacchon se dur se nahin balki unke paas jaakar apni baat kahen
 Do not speak to the other room
 baatcheet karne se pehle apane bachche kii hit ke anusaar jhuk jaaen
 If possible, sit down and talk in their eyes
 jab ve aapse baat kar rahe hon to aap jo kaam kar rahi hai, use chhod den or dhyaan se unki baat sunen
 2-be specific - Talk to the point you want to say
 bahut zyada lambey vaakya or bade-bade shabdon kaa istemaal naa karen
 Do not talk freely and say them in simple and straight words
 kai baar bacchon ko isliye bhi aapaki baaten yaad nahin rahati hai kyonki aapane bahut lanbaa nirdesh diya tha or unke dimag se aapaki baat nikal gai
 Like- you can say your words in one word many times- brush it before going to bed instead of saying- Teeth! tum apane kamare main jaao, yahaan khadey mat raho kehane ke bajaae room! kahen
 3-don't ask them but tell- son, can you pass the salt? The answer may be yes or no
 agar aap chaahati hai ki aapkaa baccha aapaki baat maane to unase puche nahin balki kahen
 For example, i want you to clean your room in the next hour
 aap apane juute utaar lijie
 Or say - Shoes please! 4- Time and patience - In most schools, teachers believe in the concept of wait time
 jab aap apane bachche se kuch kahen to unhen kam se kam 7-8 second kaa samay den taaki ve aapaki baat samaj saken
 With this trick, children believe in school
 kuch bacchon ko isse zyada samay lag saktaa he
 If your child does not respond immediately, he is not necessarily ignoring your point
 vah yah soch rahaa hota he ki use kya or kaise jawaab dena he
 You should not shout at this time
 unhen thodaa sa time den taaki unke dimag main data process ho saken!5-bacchon ko vikalp den-sabhi bachche har nirdesh kaa paalan karne vaale nahin hote hai
 When you ask them to say something, they refuse to listen to you and become rebellious
 khaskar jab ve tinage main pahunchate hai
 You give them the power of choice
 unhen vikalp dijie
 Like- either clean the room or do not go to the movies with your sisters
 yaa to aap apni teble saaf kar len yaa phir baad main bartan saaf kar len

 The BJP has alleged that Nitish Kumar Swabhiman is holding a rally with those who join the soil of Bihar's honor and self-respect

 He alleged that in order to save power, Nitish Kumar fell at the feet of Lalu Prasad, whose 15 years of rule, millions of Biharis had to go to other states to work hard and lose their self-respect
 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki nitish kumaar ne uscongress se milakar bhi bihar ko apamaanit kiya, jiske raaj main 1000 logon kii jaan lene vaala bhagalpur danga hua tha
 Sushil, who was the deputy chief minister in Nitish's cabinet during the NDA rule, alleged that Nitish Kumar had brought opportunism to the support of those who had humiliated Bihar with genocides, riots and impoverishment of the poor
 ve bataaen ki jinke chalate bihari kahlaana shame kii baat ho gai thi, unhi logon se milakar pradesh ke swabhimaan kii raksha kaise ho sakati he
 He said that the government can be saved with the support of Lalu Prasad but the self-respect of Bihar cannot be saved
 susheel ne kaha ki mukhyamantri bataayen ki eemaandaar afasaron ko kanoon kaa raaj kaayam karne kii keemat kyon chukaani pad rahi he
 Lalu Prasad and Patna Superintendent of Police Vikas Vaibhav were humiliated and transferred late night under Congress pressure

 Nitish Kumar tell how he will save the self-respect of Bihar by dropping the morale of the administration
 dilli hai court ne jeenyu prashasan ko deshadroh ke aaropee chaatr umr khalid or anirbaan bhattacharya ke khilaaf 28 sitambar tak karrwai na karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 The court also sought a response from the JNU administration, prohibiting the action of two more JNU students against taking action against them
 jeenyu kii taraf se pesh vakil ne kaha ki unhen maamle main apana paksh majboot karne ke liye atirikt dastavej pesh karne hai, aise main unhen kuch vakt or diya jaae
 The lawyer has assured the High Court that till the hearing of the case is not completed in the High Court, action will not be taken against the students
 pehle 8 sitambar tak lagaai thi rokisse pehle hai court ne somvaar ko jeenyu ke 22 agast ko jari aadesh par 8 sitambar tak roak lagaai thi
 In this order, in the disputed program held on February 9, 19 students including alumni union president Kanhaiya Kumar, Omar were convicted of indiscipline
 yachikakarta chaatro ne yachika daayar kar aarope lagaaya he ki unhen galat tareeke se kuch semistar ke liye nilambit kiya gaya he
 In this case, the implementation of the decision should be stayed till the disposal of his appeal

 If not the irony of Indian cricket, what else can be said that some of the superstars of the team could not get the farewell they deserved
 jab jab in khilaadiyon ne team india ke liye ran barasaaye yaa wicket chatkaaye to puraa desh unka divaana hua, puraa desh ek saath jhuumane ko majaboor hua
 But when i came to say farewell, he had to leave the field with heartache and despair
 nabbe ke dashak ke baadaraahul dravid,ve ve es lakshmana,anil kumbaleoresorav gangulijaise diggajon ke yogadan ko agar bhartiya cricket se nikaal diya jaae to phir cricket premiyon ke paas fakhr karne ko kuch khaas batch nahin jaataa
 But alas, they too had to bid farewell to Team India only with heartache
 or ab aisa hi kuchhavirendra sahvaag,gautam gambhir,harbhajan singh,jahir khanorayuvraj singhjaise cricketron ke saath hota dikhaai de rahaa he
 Admittedly, they may not be as great as Sachin Tendulkar, but what they did for the team, is it not entitled to a respectful farewell? When Jumbo announced his sudden retirement
 
 
 anil kumble ne 2008 main australia ke viruddh test siries ke bich main hi sanyas le liya
 Caused injury
 lekin chot se bhi badi baat ye thi ki usee siries ke pehle test main amit mishra ne shandaar debyue kiya or kul 7 wicket jatke
 If sources are to be believed then the selectors put pressure on Kumble and forced him to retire
 deal se hua dada kaa bhi ritairement
 
 
 At the end of the same series of 2008, Sourav Ganguly also said goodbye to Test cricket
 ye vahi daur tha jab seniors ko team se baahar nikaalane kii kavayad shuru ho chuki thi
 Ganguly announced his retirement just before the final Test against Australia
 baad main khabaren ain ki ganguli ko pehle hi bataa diya gaya tha ki ye aapkaa aakhri test siries he
 While Dada's dream was to play his last test in his home ground Eden Gardens, this dream remained a dream
 'diwaar' bhi aise hi dhah gai
 
 
 'the Wall' Rahul Dravid was also not spared after failing in the 2011–2012 tour of Australia
 sadiyaan guzar jaati hai tab jaakar koi rahul dravid jaisaa khilaadi paidaa hota he
 But to say it is selfish to move forward, something else that we could not even give such a great player a chance to bid farewell while playing from the field
 'special' lakshmana ke kariyar kaa dukhad ant
 
 
 Very very special Laxman's career also had a sad end
 2012 main newjiland ke khilaaf gharelu siries se thik pehle sanyas lekar lakshmana ne sabko chaunkaa diya, jabaki unka naam team main shaamil tha
 It is believed that Laxman was extremely hurt by the attitude of the board, captain and selectors
 khilaadi khud bhi len sabak
 
 
 However, if the Indian players could learn from the cricketers of Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand and take retirement at the right time, then perhaps this time is not available
 lekin is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki in players ke ritairement plan ko board kahin behatar dhang se manage kar saktaa tha
 Will the same happen to Veeru, Bhajji, Yuvi and Gotti? By withdrawing their names from the Deodhar Trophy, Veeru and Gauti have clearly indicated that they too are now very close to retirement
 viru ne to saaf-saaf ye kah bhi diya ki ab ve yuva khilaadiyon ke raah kaa roda nahin bananaa chaahate
 Yuvi has already said that now he might not get a chance to play for Team India again
 bache bhajji, to unke liye bhi team main vaapasi ke maukey bahut kam hi hai
 Whatever happened to Saurav, Dravid, Laxman and Kumble was not justified
 lekin jis tarah kii paristhitiyaan is vakt ban rahi hai, usko dekhakar yahi lag rahaa he ki sahvaag, gambhir, harbhajan or yuvaraj ko bhi shaan or izzat ke saath maidan se vidaai kaa mauka nahin mil paaegaa
 There is also a saying that the end is good, but despite so many contributions, the end of these super stars was tragic
 sach he ki ham hindustani bahut imotional hote hai lekin afsos ki bhartiya cricket ke karta-dhartaaon ko in mahaan khilaadiyon ke dard kaa andaja tak nahin hota
 England cricket team captain Eoin Morgan believes that India hosting the World T20 is a strong contender for the title
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko gharelu paristhatiyon kaa laabh milegaa
 Team India is in tremendous form, it is worth mentioning that the Indian team is going into the World T20 after winning two consecutive T20 series and Asia Cup
 usne australia or srilanka ko maat dene ke baad haal hi main asia cap apane naam kiya he
 Morgan said, "the Indian team is a strong contender to win the title as it is playing at home
" use iskaa laabh milegaa
 The team is in very good form
 'hamaare paas hai do anbhavi spinnerbharat main paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue yahaan spinneron or dhimi gati ke gendbaajon ko madad milane kii ummid he
 To this, Morgan said that he has bowlers like Adil Rashid and Moin Ali which can prove useful for the team in such circumstances
 morgan ne kaha, 'hamaare paas do anbhavi spinner hai
 Adil and Moin have been in excellent form for the past few months
 'acha khel rahi he hamaari tikepani team ke bare main morgan kaa kahana he ki unki team is samay acha khel rahi he
 He said, 'I am confident about my team
 south africa daure se pehle ham acha khel rahe the
 There are good players in our team

 At the same time, he got an eye on Pradyuman Thakur
 usne chaaku nikaala or pradhyumna kaa galaa katkar uski hatya kar di
 Pradyuman was not sexually abused during this time
 sibiai pravaktaa abhishek dayaal ke mutabik, bas conductor ashok kumaar ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mila he
 The Gurugram police had only accused the conductor in this dastardly incident that shook the entire country

 At the time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was trying to feed the lotus in the assembly due to big announcements and smokeless propaganda in Bihar, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat changed the course of the election by giving an anti-reservation statement in one of his interviews
 itihaas usee kshan ko shaayad phir se doharaa rahaa he
 a senior Sangh leader and thinker Manmohan Vaidya has said that reservation should be scrapped
 vaidya ne kaha, 'aarakshan algaavvaad badhaata he
 Reservation should end and everyone should get equal education and equal opportunities'
 yah chunaav ke laakshagrih ko aag kii salaai dikhaane jaisaa bayaan he or aisa lagata he ki sangh ne bhaajapa ke pair par yah bayaan dekarkulhadimaar di he
 This statement of Bhagwat was then hyped by Nitish Kumar
 lalu prasad ne apane lagbhag har bhaashan main iskaa zikr kiya tha or is tarah ati pichhadon or daliton ke bich jari bhaajapa kii soshal ejineering dhari rah gai thi
 The BJP, which was reduced to the votes of the forward, lost badly in the Bihar assembly elections
 yah haar bhaajapa kii haar thi
 But analysts believe and one of the main reasons why the BJP suffered this defeat was Bhagwat's statement
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kaa samikarnauttar pradesh main bhartiya janata party kaa sara ganit hi jin jatiyon ke ird-gird he, voarakshanki paridhi main aane vaali jatiyaan hai
 The BJP is confident of votes only from the forwards
 lagbhag 40 pratishat vot aisa he, jisamen bhaajapa ko shaayad hi kuch hissaa mili
 This vote bank is of Muslims, Jatavs and Yadavs
 bhaajapa keval agadon ke vot ke sahare satta ke singhaasana par baith nahin sakati
 That is why she is focusing her attention on non-jatav Dalits and Yadavs and other obcs and obcs
 bhaajapa kaa akalan he ki jeet ke liye zaruri sankhya inhen jatiwargon se aa sakati he
 But if Manmohan Vaidya's statement becomes the slogan of propaganda by anti-bjp parties, then it is bad news for BJP
 or aisa koi kaaran nahin he ki anya raajnneetik dal is avasar ko chukenge
 BJP is in trouble now
 ek tarah se yah bhaajapa ke prachaar abhiyaan ko bada jhatka he or bhaajapa ke liye ab vot maangane main khaasi mushkil saamne aa sakati he
 Bihar is a testimony to the adverse effect of such statements

 The long-running tussle over seat-sharing in Bihar NDA may end today
 dilli main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke ghar par ravivaar ko endie kii baithak honi he
 JDU chief Nitish Kumar, ljp's Ram Vilas Paswan and Chirag Paswan will be in the meeting where the final round of seat sharing talks will take place
 iske baad ravivaar ko hi seat bantwaare kaa elaan ho saktaa he
 The BJP and JDU have already shared 17-17 seats
 reports ke mutabik is baar bhaajapa lok janashakti party ke hisse se ek seat lekar 18 par chunaav ladegi, vahiin jadyu ke hisse main 17 siten aaengi
 Amit Shah can please Ram Vilas Paswan's party by giving him five seats in Bihar, one seat in UP and one Rajya Sabha seat
 pichhali baahar algepi ne saat siton par chunaav ladaa tha, jinamein se chah siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 Let me tell you, like the last Lok Sabha election, this time on the demand of seven seats, the Adi Lok Janshakti Party had demanded the finalization of the seat sharing between the NDA in Bihar by 31 December
 saansad chiraag paswan ne twit karke bhaajapa or endie par sawaal uthaae the
 He had said, 'after the TDP and RLSP have gone from the NDA alliance, the NDA alliance is going through a delicate turn
 aise samay main bhartiya janata party gathbandhan main philhal bache hue saathiyon kii chintaaon ko samay rahete sammaan purvak tareeke se dur kiya jaae
 'at the same time he had said,' i met the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party many times regarding the seats of the coalition, but so far nothing concrete has been done
 is vishay par samay rahete baat nahin bani to isse nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he'
 On the other hand, LJP state president and minister in Bihar's NDA government, Pashupati Kumar Paras, said that Chirag's tweet was correct and in keeping with the party's spirit and said that there is a lot of delay in seat sharing in NDA
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki rajg main sabase bady party iskaa netritv kar rahi bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko sabhi dalon ko saath bithakar siton kaa bantwaaraa karnaa chahie tha par aisa unhone nahin kiya
 Paras had alleged that the two parties (JDU and BJP) together divided the Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in half and did not even ask the LJP national president
 yah parampara galat he

 In the MCD, the opposition lashed out at the ruling party on this issue
 vipaksh ke mutabik fund kii kami se karmchaariyon ko tankhwaah naa milane ke kaaran wo imaanadaaree se kaam nahin kar rahe jiske kaaran hi may main itane maamle saamne aa gaye
 However, BJP says that it has resolved the issue of salary and dengue will be prevented with immediate effect
 is laaparvaahee or letlatifi kaa khamiyaaza dilli ko bhugatna pad saktaa he
 But if Delhi also suffers the sting of dengue after the strike of the sanitation workers and then the doctors, then the functioning of the BJP sitting in power of the corporation will be questioned
 chhattisgarh hoicourt ne baaghon kii sankhya par chintaa jaahir kii he
 Achanakmar Tiger Reserve has come under target of the Century High Court
 court ne centuri main baaghon kii sankhya ke daavon par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 The High Court is hearing a four-year-old petition
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne baaghon kii sankhya ke sarkari aankado par sawaal uthaae
 The court said in the comment that the claim of having 28 tigers in the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve Century does not seem viable
 court ne kaha ki vahaan itane baagh hote to dikhte jarur
 In fact, every month, thousands of tourists come to see tigers in the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve Century in Bilaspur
 lekin paryatakon ko maayusi haath lagati he
 Tourists do not see any tigers even when walking from morning to evening

 rajya ke grih vibhaag ne aaj unako nilambit karne kaa prastaav diya tha, jise swikaar kar liya gaya
 However, a Mumbai court had recently granted him anticipatory bail, stating that the complainant's behavior and exchange of email messages with Parskar indicated his consent

 unhone praathmiki darj karaane main vilamb rekhaankit kiya
 In Bollywood, every type of dance form is used for film songs
 vaile dance se lekar clasical dance tak har tarah ke kai dance form main maharath hasil karne ke liye pasinaa bahaate najar aate hai

 This decision is considered a big relief for the Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Vice President Rahul Gandhi and other leaders accused in this case
 associats jarnals limited (ageel) neshnal herald akhbaar kii malikana company he
 Congress took its liabilities of Rs 90 crore on 26 February 2011
 iskaa arth ye hua ki party ne ise 90 karod kaa lone de diya
 After this, Young Indian Company was formed with Rs 5 lakh, in which Sonia and Rahul hold 38-38 per cent stake
 baaki kii 24 fisadi hissedari congress netaa motilal vora or auskar furnandis ke paas he
 After this, nine crore shares of Rs 10 each of TAJL were given to 'young Indian' and in return Young Indian was to repay the Congress loan
 9 karod share ke saath yang indian ko is company ke 99 fisadi share hasil ho gaye
 After this, the Congress Party also waived a loan of 90 crores
 yani 'yang indian' ko muft main tiageel kaa swaamitv mil gaya
 bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy alleged that all this was done to capture the Rs 16 hundred crore building of Herald House located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in Delhi

 This case is currently in Patiala House Court in Delhi and Sonia and Rahul are on bail in it

 In the video, an unknown Kashmiri youth has demanded the Modi government to open a liquor shop
 video main jameen par baithe yuvak ne kaha he- 'yahaan sadaken bhi ban gayi, skool bhi ban gaye or college bhi
 Now a wine shop should open in Anantnag
 kyonki ladakon ko ek bottle ke liye srinagar janaa padataa he
 It takes 200 to 300 rupees to travel
 ye ninsaphi he, srinagar ke liye wine shop, lekin anantnag ke liye nahin
 So i appeal to the government, Modi ji open a wine shop in Anantnag
 taaki ladakon ko sahuuliyat ho
 Liquor of 250 rupees is sold here for 500 in Black

 The comments videshmantralay kii pravaktaa victoria nuland ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, bharat or pakistan ke bich badhate ucchstareey sampark kaa ham dridhtaa se samarthan karte hai
 We believe that this visit was a good thing and we are also happy with the progress made on the visa issue
 yah baat ateet main aarthik muddon par hui pragati ke paksh main jaati he
 In response to a question, Nuland said that the vision of the External Affairs Minister is to develop a strong relationship with all neighbors, so that all countries can move towards prosperity
 pravaktaa ne bataaya, nishchit rup se is par abhi or adhik kaam karne kii jarurat he, lekin jab kabhi bhi ham bhartiya paksh or pakistani paksh kii taraf dekhte hai to ham log ek-duusare se baatcheet karne ke liye unke prayaas kaa samarthan karte hai, kyonki yah sirf un donon deshon ke hit main nahin, balki puure kshetra ke hit main he
 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters, "we strongly support the growing high-level connectivity between India and Pakistan
" ham maanate hai ki yah yatra acchhee baat thi or ham log vija mudde par hui pragati se bhi khush hai
 This goes in favor of the progress made on economic issues in the past
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main nuland ne kaha ki videshmantri kaa drushtikon he ki sabhi padosiyon ke saath sambandh majbootee ke saath viksit hon, jisase sabhi desh samruddhi kii ore bad saken
 "there is definitely more work to be done on this, but whenever we look at the Indian side and the Pakistani side, we support their effort to interact with each other," the spokesperson said
 Because it is not only in the interest of those two countries, but in the interest of the whole region
 pravaktaa ne bataaya, nishchit rup se is par abhi or adhik kaam karne kii jarurat he, lekin jab kabhi bhi ham bhartiya paksh or pakistani paksh kii taraf dekhte hai to ham log ek-duusare se baatcheet karne ke liye unke prayaas kaa samarthan karte hai, kyonki yah sirf un donon deshon ke hit main nahin, balki puure kshetra ke hit main he
 Every day a message from Tribhuvan comes to my whatsapp inbox
 ek laash or uske aas-paas roti-bilakhti auraton kii tasviir hoti he
 In Uttar Pradesh, such a corpse is called Shikshamitra, among which the number of people still alive is twenty-two lakh
 marane waalon ke kaaran alag-alag hai,magar sadma,dil kaa daura or avsaad ke alaava aatmahatya bhi bada kaaran he
 When Shikamitra Tribhuvan came to my office with the file of these deaths, for a long time, that thick file remained stuck in the mind, as if someone had kept 100-200 corpses in the room
 'prime Time'main dikhaane ke baad shikshamitron ne dhanyavad kaa sandeshaa to bhej diya,lekin dikhaane ke baad hua kya,iskaa jawaab zero he
 nothing happen
 aaj bhi shikshamitron kii laash kii tasviren mere inbox main aa rahi hai
 i have nothing for thousands of Shiksha Mitras like Tribhuvan
 shikshamitron ne17-18saal tak sarkaar ke skulon main padhaayaa he
 The government has trained them from time to time and has also done different types of government work
 inaki naukari pakki bhi hui,magar hoicourt or supreme court main cese haar gaye
 Faizan Mustafa said in the show 'prime Time' that his case was not fought reliably and many sides appear to be weak, while they have no drawbacks
 phir supreme court ne kahin nahin kaha tha ki inaki selary40,000se ghataakar10,000kar di jaae,magar turant hi inaki selary10,000kar di gai,jabaki ab bhi ve sevaayen de rahe hai
 In a 17-year job, he got a salary of 30,000 to 40,000 for two to three years
 usase pehle ye1,400se2,000kii selary par kaam kar rahe the
 Even those who expect quality like Ambani's fictional university with so little money, will come to the earth every Sunday to give their opinion
 shikshamitra laachaar hai
 They are protesting
 maare-maare phir rahe hai or ant main mar jate hai
 Sometimes due to illness, sometimes with despair
 inaki sankhya paune do lakh he,magar inaki sunne vaala koi nahin he
 They are wandering in our democracy by forwarding pictures of their own comrades
 paise kii tangi ne inhen itnaa tod diya he ki bahuton ke mobile main charge kaa paisa tak nahin hota he
 On talking about Shiksha Mitras, some messages start coming in that these people are thieves, they do not teach
 yah nahin karte hai,vah nahin karte hai,magar kisi kaa ek massej nahin aata he ki inaki haalat to bahut karaab he
 The state should not do such injustice to them
 uttar pradesh main30,000se adhik lekhpal3july se hadtaal par hai
 Their demands are not such that the government has to bring stars by breaking them
 'prime Time'main lekhapaalon ke bare main dikhaane par aisi hi pratikriyaayein aa rahi hai ki inhen janata se koi matlab nahin,ye janata kaa koon chuusate hai
 You should not sympathize with them
 ek to loktantric tareeke se pradarshan kar rahe kisi jansamooh ko dekhne kaa sahi tarika nahin he,uski maangon ko ham uske prati janata ke bich chhavi ke chashme se nahin dekh sakate hai
 Then what is the image of our leaders that we hand over power to them
 main lekhpal ke bare main nahin jaanata tha
 The accountants knew that the media of today does not know about Patwari, Amin and Lekhpal, so an accountant hung a list of 41 of his works on a long paper like a horoscope so that everyone could understand
 log media se bhi zyaada rachanaatmak hai
 Many people sent pictures of working, through which i could see that Lekhpal, from flood to flood, drought, arson, hail, measuring from land to village, first recorded the data in the government records
 kitne rakabe main fasal boi gai he or kitni hui he,yah ricard bhi lekhapaalon ke zariye krishi mantralay tak jaataa he
 Their job is to measure the village lands and keep records
 angrezon kii banaai yah patawaari vyavastha kai khaamiyon se grast he,magar inkaa upyog he,vah inke kaaryon kii suchi se sabit to hota hi he
 If these do not work, then should it be assumed that there is no government on the ground
 koi kaam hi nahin karata he
 If someone works, it should be paid appropriately or not
 sarkaar dinabhar daawey karti rahati he ki bhrashtachar khatm kar diya he,phir uske karmchaariyon kii maang ke samay kyon kaha jaataa he ki ye upar se kama lete hai
 Then the money taken down would have reached the top as well
 sarkari karmchaariyon ko samajhnaa hoga ki ve is chhavi se kaise ladenge or ve nahin ladenge,to dharna dete rah jaaenge,or hoga kuch nahin,lekin sarkari karmchaaree chor hai,yah baat janata or sarkaar tab kyon kahati he,jab ve apni jaays maangon ko lekar awaz uthaate hai
 Those who call them thieves are also no less thieves
 maine kai tahseelon ke video dekhe,jo lekhpal bandhuon ne bhi mere liye bheje,taaki main dekh sakuun ki ve kisi jagahon par kaam karte hai
 At the bottom of the dilapidated buildings are working on the floor on the floor
 bharat21veen sadi main'superpower'or'vishwaguru'banane ja rahaa he
 
 
 ! Which of the 'superpowers' have you seen here that 30,000 employees work under the verandah and trees
 bharat bhar main karodon rupee foonkkar swatchta kaa dhindhora peeta gaya,magar sarkari karyaalayon main hi shauchalay nahin he
 There is no arrangement for their cleanliness
 ham sab dashakon se yah dekhte aa rahe hai
 Lekhpal has also lived his condition, but the matter of change is meaningless
 lekhapaalon ko2,000kaa pe grad miltaa he,jo bahut kam he
 Knowing the travel allowance they receive, they will not cry, laugh
 3rupee33paise pratidin yatra bhatta miltaa he or itnaa hi steshnari kaa paisa diya jaataa he
 Are these people not doing government work out of their own pocket or from the pocket of public
 
 
 ? kya isamen badlaav nahin hona chahie
 Should not our lower staircase have the most important seating, water and toilet facilities, should there be fans in their rooms as well
 
 
 ? Actually, a large number of people have entered this democracy, which is ruining the people
 janata ko hi lagaataar kah rahi he ki tum chor ho
 Lekhpal, Shikshamitra and BTC teacher and BTC Urdu teacher who consider themselves as public, only see these things in the context of their demands, but will see clearly in the context of others
 janata ko yah dekhnaa chahie ki sarkaar usee ke saath nahin,duusare ke saath kaisaa vyavhaar kar rahi he
 If the people will be separated from the people, then it will not remain in front of the government
 bas kuch logon kii bheed rahegi,jise koi sipaahi bhi colector ke aadesh par haank aayega
 In Uttar Pradesh, about 12,460 BTC teachers were programmed many times that even after winning the court twice, the government is not giving appointment letters
 in logon kaa swaarth dekhie
 Not even once did he tell me that he has 4,000 Urdu teachers along with him and he is waiting for the appointment letter after winning the case from the court like him, while the advertisement of both came out together, the case of both is one
 12,460shikshakon ne aasaani se4,000urdu shikshakon ko alag kar diya
 Considering Muslims did or did under 'apne Apna Dekho', i do not want to gossip about it, but 30 percent of the 4,000 Urdu teachers are non-muslims and out of 12,460 BTC teachers are also Muslims
 kya pataa,urdu shikshakon ne hi khud ko alag kar liya ho ki apni ladaai alag ladenge
 i do not have all the facts about it
 maine12,460beatisi shikshakon or4,000beatisi urdu shikshakon kaa udhaaharan isliye diya,taaki aap samaj saken ki janata tukdon-tukdon main janata nahin ho sakati
 It is true that these 16,460 teachers have fought fiercely in Uttar Pradesh
 har zile main dharna pradarshan kiya he or laathiyaan khai hai
 Yet they have not won their full fight
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke aashwaasan ke baad bhi or court ke chaar hafte main niyukti patr dene ke aadesh ke baad bhi sabko niyukti patr nahin mila he
 Only about 5,000 have received appointment letters and are still waiting for around 12,000 appointment letters
 abhi bhi donon milakar nahin lard rahe hai
 The public is constantly losing in front of the government on whose strength leaders win and form the government
 uskaa janata bananaa baaki he
 She would run after religious hysteria, racist arrogance and consider herself public, but whenever she would raise her voice, she would be crushed
 paune do lakh shikshamitron, 30,000lekhapaalon or12,000shikshakon ko sochna chahie ki ve apni ladaai alag kyon lard rahe hai,kya unki sahanubhuti ek duusare se he,is sawaal kaa eemaandaar jawaab unke liye behatar bhavishya kii disha tay karegaa
 The comments in sabko eemaandaaree se ek or sawaal par gaur karnaa chahie
 What kind of news were they drunk before going on the movement
 kya ve patrakarita ke paimaane par kii jane vaali khabaron ke prati samarpit the yaa unke bacchon ko dangai bana dene ke liye chal rahi hindu-muslim bahason main bah rahe the
 You cannot become a public suddenly and by suddenly becoming an audience, you cannot claim the news that everything should be done with the ethics of journalism
 ise bhrasht karne main graahak banakar aapane jo bhoomika adaa kii he,uski sazaa to bhugatni padegi
 Who cares that on July 17 and 18, the railways' local people will be driving hungry
 ve kaam karte hue apni maang ko lekar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 If you expect from channels, then tell me what you have been watching before this expectation
 ganimat he,jila sanskarnon main aapaki khabaren chap ja rahi hai
 You have seen what has happened to you by tweeting on Twitter
 mantriyon ko fark padaa,na media ko
 By the time you see the Hindu Muslim topic and make a political decision based on this, you will die or be killed like this, and will keep forwarding pictures of the corpses of your own colleagues in whatsapp
 achaanak unmaadi bheed se nikal ratorat aap janata nahin ban sakate
 Didn't you make sure that after the election the media and religious frenzy crowd and craze dominate the media, are you not part of that cynical crowd, you will get the answer from the same whatsapp and Facebook, through which you are sending me congratulations Huh
 aap nahin the,to koun tha is bheed main
 You have decided that the journalists who are doing journalism, go through the difficulty and disappear slowly
 is laudspikar kii taar aapane bhi kaati he
 Of course, this wire has been cut by media houses and leaders including journalists before you
 itnaa to samaj lijie ki yab sab isliye kiya ja rahaa he,taaki janata yah samaj le ki ab se sirf sankhya tay nahin karegi ki aap janata hai

 Shikshamitras have taught in government schools for 17–18 years
 sarkaar ne inhen samay-samay par prashikshan diya he or alag-alag tarah ke sarkari kaam bhi liye hai
 His job was also confirmed, but he lost cases in the High Court and the Supreme Court
 faizan mustafaa ne'prime Time'sho main kaha tha ki inkaa cese majbooti se nahin ladaa gaya or kai paksh kamazor nazar aate hai,jabaki inaki apni koi kami nahin he
 Then the Supreme Court did not say that their salary should be reduced from 40,000 to 10,000, but immediately their salary was reduced to 10,000, while still they are providing services
 17saal kii naukari main do se teen saal hi inhen30,000se40,000kii selary mili he
 Before that he was working on a salary of 1,400 to 2,000
 itane kam paise main inase ambani kii kaalpanik uniwarsity kii tarah gunvattta kii ummid karne vaale bhi chand se har ravivaar dharti par raay dene aate honge
 Shikshamitra is helpless
 ve dharna-pradarshan kar rahe hai
 All are living and eventually die
 kabhi beemaari kii maar se,kabhi apni hataasha se
 Their number is twenty-two lakh, but there is no one to listen to them
 ye hamaare loktantr main apane hi saathiyon kii laash kii tasviren forward karte hue bhatak rahe hai
 The cash crunch has broken them so much that many mobiles do not even have the money to charge
 shikshamitron kii baat karne par kuch massej aane lagata he ki ye log chor hai,padhaate nahin hai
 They do not do this, they do not do it, but there is no message from anyone that their condition is very bad
 inke saath rajya ko aisa anyaay nahin karnaa chahie
 More than 30,000 Lekhpals have been on strike since 3 July in Uttar Pradesh
 unki maangen aisi nahin hai ki sarkaar ko taare todakar laane paden
 'prime Time' is getting similar reactions after showing about the accountants that they do not mean anything to the public, they suck the blood of the public
 aapako inase sahanubhuti nahin rakhni chahie
 For one, it is not the right way to see a democratically performing public, we cannot see their demands through the spectacles of the public 
 phir to hamaare netaaon kii koun-si chhavi aisi he ki ham unhen satta saunp dete hai
 i did not know about Lekhpal
 lekhapaalon ko pataa tha ki aaj kaa media patawaari,amin or lekhpal ke bare main nahin jaanata he,isliye ek lekhpal ne janmapatri kii tarah ek lambey-se kaagaz par apane41kaaryon kii suchi likhakar taang di,taaki sab samaj saken
 People are more creative than media
 kai logon ne kaam karte hue kii tasviren bhejin,jinke zariye main dekh sakaa ki lekhpal baadh,sukhaad,aagjanee,olavrishti ke vakt zamin se lekar gaanv tak kii paimaaish karte hai,aankadon ko sabase pehle vahi binakar sarkari record main darj karte hai
 In how much area the crop has been sown and how much has been done, this record also goes to the Ministry of Agriculture through accountants
 gaanv kii zameenon kii paimaaish karnaa or record rakhana inkaa hi kaam he
 This patwari system, made by the British, suffers from many flaws, but their use is proved by their list of works
 agar ye kaam nahin karte hai to phir kya yah maan liya jaae ki zamin par sarkaar nahin he
 Nothing works
 agar koi kaam karata he,to us kaam kaa uchit mehtaanaa milanaa chahie ki nahin
 The government keeps making claims throughout the day that corruption has ended, then why are they said that they earn from above when demanded by their employees
 to phir neeche liya gaya paisa upar tak bhi pahunchataa hoga
 Government employees will have to understand how they will fight this image and if they do not fight, then they will continue to picket, and nothing will happen, but the government employees are thieves, why does the public and the government say this when they give their legitimate demands They raise their voices
 unhen chor kehane vaale bhi kam chor nahin hai
 i watched videos of several tehsils, which the Lekhpal brothers also sent for me, so that i could see how they work in places

 The darasal,is loktantr main bahut badi sankhya main aise logon kii fouj ghus gai he,jo janata ko hi barbaad kar rahi he
 It is constantly telling the public that you are a thief
 khud ko janata samajhane vaale lekhpal,shikshamitra or beatisi shikshak or beatisi urdu shikshak in baton ko sirf apni maangon ke sandarbh main dekhte hai,magar duusare ke sandarbh main dekhenge,to saaf-saaf dikh jayega
 The public should see how the government is treating the other, not the same
 janata hi janata se alag ho jaaegi,to phir vah sarkaar ke saamne janata nahin rahegi
 There will be a crowd of just a few people, which even a soldier will laugh at the orders of the Collector
 uttar pradesh main12,460beatisi shikshakon ke bare main kai baar kaarykram kiya ki court se do-do baar jeetne ke baad bhi sarkaar niyukti patr nahin de rahi he
 See the selfishness of these people
 inhone ek baar bhi mujhe nahin kaha ki unheen ke saath4,000urdu shikshak bhi hai or ve bhi unheen kii tarah court se cese jeet kar niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai,jabaki donon kaa vigyaapan ek saath niklaa tha,donon kaa maamla ek he

 Do not know, Urdu teachers have separated themselves that they will fight their battles separately
 mere paas iske bare main saare tathy nahin hai
 i gave the example of 12,460 BTC teachers and 4,000 BTC Urdu teachers, so that you can understand that the people cannot be public in pieces
 yah sahi he ki in16,460shikshakon ne uttar pradesh main jabardast sangharsh kiya he
 In every district, there has been picketing and ate sticks
 phir bhi ve apni puri ladaai nahin jeet paae hai
 Notwithstanding the assurance of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and even after the court ordered the appointment letter in four weeks, not everyone has received the appointment letter

 Still both are not fighting together
 jis janata ke dam par netaa jitkar sarkaar bana lete hai,us sarkaar ke saamne janata lagaataar haar rahi he
 It is yet to become public
 vah dharmik unmaad,jativaadee ahankaar ke peeche daudkar khud ko janata samajhati rahe,magar jab bhi vah awaz uthaaegi,kuchal di jaaegi
 Twenty-two lakh Shikshamitras, 30,000 Lekhpalas and 12,000 teachers should think why they are fighting their battles separately, whether they have sympathy with each other, honest answer to this question will decide the future for them

 You cannot become a public overnight by suddenly coming out of a crazy crowd

 Jorash lashari, president of the Film Executives Association, told reporters that after detailed discussions with the parties concerned it was decided that the performances of Indian films should be restored from tomorrow
 unhone yahaan kaha, ''cinemaghar maalikon evam is udyog ke anya pakshon par bhartiya filmon ke pradarshan par asthaayee roak ke faisle kii badi maar padi he
 a lot of investment was made for upgrading and building new cineplexes and multi-plexes, but the business is currently dependent on the performance of new Indian films
 '' cinemaghar maalikon ne kaha ki unhone bhartiya filmon ke pradarshan par bas asthaayee roak lagaai thi na ki purna roak
 Nadeem Mandiwala of Atrium Cinema said that the films which could not be shown due to temporary ban, would be shown first
 dikhaayi jane vaali sabase pehali film navazuddin siddiqui kii 'freeki ali' hogi
 Sources in the industry said that after the new and old Pakistani films and the latest Hollywood films, the halls remained vacant when most of the cinema owners, distributors and importers of Indian films lost their hands
 tippaniyan a source said, "also in recent weeks many Indian films have been released while everyone is eagerly waiting for Aamir Khan's film Dangal"
 '' haalanki ek sutara ne kaha ki kuch cinema maalikon ko ashanka he ki bhartiya filmon kaa pradarshan behaal karne par dharmik dalon yaa samoohon kii taraf se kadi pratikriya aa sakati he or isliye unhone jarurat padane par suraksha maangi he

 ' 1 july se jiesti lagu hone ja rahaa he
 Due to this a lot will change financially in the country
 kuch chijen mahangi hongi, kuch sasti
 Meanwhile, there are speculations that your banking, telecom service, hotel and insurance will become expensive due to GST
 inase judi companiyaan baqayda apane customers ko isaki soochna bhi dene lagi hai
 In this way, the banks have been mailed to their customers for the last few days that from July, the tax on credit card bills will increase from 15% to 18%
 isi tarah telecom companiyon nen bhi kaha tha ki input tex credit par laabh jaise kam hoga vaise masik bill main bhi vruddhi hogi
 Telecom should be placed in a slab of 5 or 12 per cent instead of 18, however, seeing the poor situation in the telecom sector, companies like Airtel and Idea have asked the ministry to treat the telecom sector as essential services and it should be replaced with 18 per cent inside GST
 5 or 12 per cent slabs should be kept inside
 jab daren pichley maheene tay kii gai thim, to sarkaar ne kaha tha ki input credit jo companiyon ke liye uplabdh hoga us par atirikt boj nahin padegaa or isse lagbhag 3 fisadi laagat kam ho jaaegi
 Insurance plan licensing companies have also said that with 15 to 18 per cent of the levy, it will increase the tax premium further and the most impact will be on the pure term
 yadi aap 1 karod kaa plan ke liye 25000 rupye kaa vaarshik premium lete hai to jiesti ke kaaran yah 4500 kaa ho jayega, jo vartmaan main 3750 rupye he
 This will have less impact for ulips where companies are charged for management and death rates
 agar aapkaa premium 1 xxrep 4 0 rupye saal ke upar tex ke rup main 75 rupye dete he to yah bad kar 90 ho jayega
 The government did not agree, along with this, 5 star hotels are also sending their customers information about the increased tax, but the government says that this tax has been kept close to the current tax
 sevapradaataonke tark se sarkaar nen kisi tarah kii sahmati nahi jataai he
 Companies will have to give prices downside that an official told that companies should adopt the form of low prices to give benefits to the customers, we have asked the ministry to resolve this issue with the service providers as soon as possible so that there is no pressure on the customers Lie

 ek taraf rahul gandhi ne is faisle par sawaal uthaae hai to vahiin duusari ore pradhanmantri narendra modi ne in faislon ko aitihaasik qaraar diya he
 The PM tweeted and praised the Finance Minister for these decisions
 gauratlab he ki vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne shuukravaar ko jo elaan kiye hai, unamem corporate tex main chhot, capetail gen ke sarcharge main katautee jaise faisle shaamil hai
 However, after these decisions 1 on the revenue deficit of the government
 45 lakh karod rupee kaa bhaar padegaa
 This is why Rahul Gandhi has targeted the government
 rahul gandhi se pehle sipiai (em) netaa seetaram yechuri ne bhi centre sarkaar ke faislon ko naakaafi bataaya tha or ise sabase bada ghotaalaa qaraar diya tha
 Sitaram Yechury 1 from RBI on Govt
 76 lakh karod lekar corporate ko 1
 It is alleged to have given 46 lakh crores
 rahul gandhi isse pehle bhi lagaataar centre sarkaar par arthvyavastha ko lekar nishaanaa sadhate rahe hai
 At the same time, there was a Howdy Modi program of Prime Minister in America on Rahul's target
 rahul ne arthvyavastha par sawaal karte hue # houdiconomi hashteg ko aage badhaayaa tha or centre sarkaar ko gheraa tha
 Congress national general secretary and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, on Friday attacked the BSP leader Mayawati, saying that "behenji", who weaved the dream of becoming prime minister after winning the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2007, is now also worthy of becoming the chief minister
 She is no more
 uttar pradesh main kanoon vyavastha naam kii cheez nahindigvijay singh ne kaha, ’’varsh 2007 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main bahumat hasil karne ke baad bahan mayawati pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekhne lagi thim lekin jin daliton or garibon ke mat se vah satta main aayin thim unke saath hi unhone aisa vyavhaar kiya ki ab vah mukhyamantri bhi bane rahane ke kaabil nahin rah gayi hai
 "in response to a question, he said," There is no such thing as law and order in Uttar Pradesh
 jin aparaadhiyon se bahan ji satta main aane se pehle tak apni jaan ko khatra bataati thim aaj vahi na sirf unki sarkaar main shaamil hai balki bade padon ko sushobhit kar rahe hai
 "the UP government is not free to make idols," he said, ridiculing the policies of the Uttar Pradesh government and said that if the state government is discharged from making idols, then it can do any other work
 congress mahasachiv ne kaha ki mayawati sarkaar ke kushasan ke chalate basapa kaa jansamarthan kam hota ja rahaa he
 In Uttar Pradesh, plagued by the protection of criminals in Mulayam Singh's government, the people had given Mayawati a chance to form the government, but the people here are extremely disappointed
 jin daliton or garibon ke vot se mayawati satta main aayi thim aaj rajya main vahi sabase dukhi hai
 In NREGA, poor and Dalits are not being paid their due by getting them working
 singh ne aarope lagaaya, ‘‘basapa netaa rajya main puri tarah se dallali main lipt hai
 There is no such thing as law
 ’’ unhone kaha ki yahi kaaran he ki aaj yahaan kii janata sirf congress kii ore aashaa bhari nigahon se dekh rahi he or is soch kaa parinaam agle vidhansabha chunaavon main dekhne ko bhi milegaa

 At the same time, Pappu Yadav, patron and MP of Jan Adhikar Party visited this shelter home and demanded investigation of girl child houses across the country
 isse pehle pappu yadav ne mujffarpur balika grih repakand par hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the 40 people whose names and numbers have been received from Brajesh Thakur, the accused in this case, should be made public
 pappu yadavane kaha ki in naamon main kin-kin emele or emelsi kaa naam he, yah bhi janata ko bataanaa chahie
 Pappu Yadavane questioned the government and said that how can an impartial inquiry be possible on the names of influencers in those names
 unhone kaha ki purv mantri manju verma ke pati kahaan hai, unako sabake saamne laana chahie
 Pappu Yadav also raised the question as to why the Muzaffarpur DM and the welfare officer were not taken action even after such a big scandal

 Because of which he was hospitalized
 bhartiya sena swadeshi str par ek aisa vishwastareey missile chaahati he jisase dushman deshon ke ladaaku vimaanon, drone or helicopters ko nestnabud kiya ja sake
 It has assigned its lead to the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO)
 diardio ne is chunauti ko sweekaar kiya he or ummid he ki agle kuch varshon main hi sena ko swadesh nirmit aisa missile mil jayega
 In fact, the Indian Army wants to acquire eight regiments of ground-to-air instant missiles (qr-sams)

 These missiles will replace the old OSA-AK air defense system of Soviet Union

 Under a QR-SAM system, missiles are also in motion under a military operation, and they keep an eye on the enemy's drone and immediately target it
 pehle yah yojana thi ki videshi vendor sena ko teen regiment kii aapurti karenge taaki uski taatkaalik jaruraton ko puraa kiya ja sake or baaki paanch regiment kaa nirmaan diardio dwaara 'mek in india' ke tahat swedashi str par kiya jayega

 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah vishram main vishwaas nahin rakhte hai
 His priority is to expand the BJP in parts of the country where the party is not very strong organizationally
 amit shah teen din ke pashchim bengal daure par hai
 In an exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, Amit Shah spoke openly on the militants active in Kashmir to the challenge of Naxalites in Chhattisgarh
 shah ne saaf kaha ki modi sarkaar is tarah kii chunautiyon se majbootee ke saath nipategi
 Shah also expressed his impeccable views on the functioning of the Yogi government in UP from the results of the Delhi MCD election

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se baatcheet
 
 
 
 1
 Shah's mission was your big victory in bengal-delhi-delhi
 kya ab mana jaae ki bengal main aap bhagava jhanda fahraane ke liye aa gaye hai?jawaab- dekhie abhi jo meraa bengal kaa teen din kaa tour he, wo party ke vistaar kaa hi program he
 And not only in Bengal but across the country, more than three lakh BJP workers will work as full timers to expand the party at every booth
 dinadayal upaadhyaay janmashatabdi ke tahat dinadayal vistaarak yojana, jo chal rahi he, ke liye teen din ke liye bengal aayaa hum
 Naturally, when it comes to the expansion of the party, there is a greater need where the party is not organizationally strong
 hamaara focus kerala, andhra, telugana, tripura, tamilnadu, urisa, north east or bengal par he
 Thousands of workers have come out in the expansion of the Bharatiya Janata Party by holding booths in each state
 ye hamaari mahatvapurn yojana he or bengal main hamen bahut acha rispance bhi mil rahaa he
 i can clearly see that the BJP will emerge very strong in Bengal
 sawaal-trinmul kah rahi he ki sirf amit shah hi nahin aae, unke saath sibiai ai he or inakam tex department aayaa he
 They say that BJP is adopting all the methods, so that somehow Mamata Banerjee is surrounded? Answer - You have seen the Narada sting or not, i do not know
 court or sibiai jaanch aap in sabhi chizon ko said main rakh den
 When a bribe is being taken in front of the camera, then why blame anyone? Your leader was taking a bribe in front of the camera, what is the answer to this and the decision of Narada's investigation has not been taken by the Modi government, but first by the Calcutta High Court and then by the Supreme Court
 sibiai kaa kaaran kyon dekh rahe hai?sawaal- mamata kahati hai ki sidi phixd he
 She is defending her leaders
 kah rahi hai ki sajeesh ke tahat yah sab kiya gaya
 Answer - Without a camera, taking a bribe is right and getting caught on camera is a conspiracy
 meri to samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki vah kis tarah ke tark de rahi hai
 Question- But they say that the leaders who have been caught, be it Narada Sting or Sharada case, are being put under pressure to speak something against Mamata Banerjee and TMC government so that they can be broken and suppressed
 jawaab-kitne samay se sharada maamle kii jaanch chal rahi he
 At least two and a half years
 sharada cond main lipt ek bhi vyakti ne bijepi ko jwine nahin kiya he
 Nor is this our motive
 magar kya bijepi bhrashtachar ko vipaksh main rahete hue bhi bengal main ujagar naa karen
 It is the responsibility of the BJP to highlight the corruption which has increased here and thrive
 sawaal-kya aapako lagata he ki jo bhrashtachar badha he uske liye or naarad-sharada maamle ke liye mamata banerjee khud jimmedaar hai?jawaab-swaabhaavik rup se ve apni party kii adhyaksh hai
 Is the Chief Minister
 bhrashtachar ko kaabo karnaa or apane mantriyon ko control main rakhana unki jimmedaari he
 Question- Do you think that Mamta Banerjee can also go to jail or she can also be trapped? Answer - i have not said that, who will go to jail, also did not say
 lekin bhrashtachar naa bade, isaki swaabhaavik rup se jimmedaari mukhyamantri kii hoti he, party adhyaksh kii hoti he
 Question- As you are trying to expand your party in West Bengal, you are being accused of trying saffronization
 haalanki ab ham dekh rahe hai ki mamata banerjee bhi counter main ramanavami, hanuman jayanti raily is tarah se yojit kar rahi hai ki kahin ye massej naa jaae ki sirf bijepi hi dharmik party nahin he
 The more religion you know, the more we also know
 jawaab-acha he ki hamaari vajah se unhen dharm to yaad aayaa
 Question- Do you think that they are missing in bjp's affair? Otherwise Ramnavami was not celebrated here in this way
 naa hi aise raily nikalati thim
 At least she did not pull Trinamool
 jawaab-dekhie ramanavami kii raily bhi bijepi ne yojit nahin kii
 It is organized by a social organization, BJP workers and leaders take part in it
 sawaal-ek baat saaf ho gai he ki mamata banerjee ko bhi kahin naa kahin ehsaas ho gaya he ki bijepi hi mukhya vipakshi party he bengal main?jawaab-teen chunaav se yah tay ho gaya he ki ham number do par rahe hai
 The Opposition parties in Bengal are becoming irrelevant
 ab bijepi hi principal apojishan party kaa sthaan le chuki he or agle chunaav main meri baat kaa dhyaan rakhana ki bijepi hi 2019 main bengal se sabase zyada loksabhaa seat jeetegi

 sukama kaa hamalaa naksaliyon kii baukhalahatswaal-amit shah ji aap yah daawa to kar rahe hai, lekin aap jis din naksalbadi main the, usee din ittefaq se sukama main naksal hamalaa ho gaya
 People said that you are going to Naxalbadi, from there you are starting the expansion of the party and the Naxalite attack took place on the same day
 sawaal kiye gaye ki dimonetigeshan ke baad itane bade-bade vaade kiye gaye ki hamane naksaliyon kii financial ridh kii haddi tod di, naksaliyon ke paas paisa nahin rahaa
 On the other hand, there was an attack in March, there was still an attack, more than two dozen of our soldiers were martyred
 is par aap kya kahenge?jawaab- dekhie aapke sawaal kaa jawaab kaa main teen hisson main duungaa
 Why was Naxalbari selected first? This is the same area where the theory of change was developed through violence and the country suffered very bad results
 maowad or naksalwad ko desh ke nau-das rajyon kii janata ne bhugta he
 That was the aim of bjp's expansion from the same place and to start Deendayal Vistarak Yojana
 yah makasad tha ki hathiyaaron ke dam par parivartan kii vichaardhaara ke vipareet narendra modi kii ‘sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas’ or dinadayal upaadhyaay kii antyoday kii theory ko lekar aage badhanaa
 Secondly, you will assume that the pressure that has increased in Sukma is the anger of the Naxalites
 desh main bijepi kii sarkaar aane ke baad teen saal ke andar vampanthi evam charampanthiyon par jo dabaav badha he or jis prakaar ke kadam centre or rajya sarkaron ne uthaae hai
 i think they are the most effective steps in the fight of the last several decades
 lihaaja kah sakate hai ki majboot muqabla karne kaa kaam modi sarkaar ne kiya he or ye usee kaa riection he
 Question - still they are hurting us
 jawaab-ladaai jab hoti he, to iskaa matlab ye nahin hota ki ek taraf se hi hamalaa hota he
 The fight is called the same when there is an attack from both sides
 magar ye jo 24 jawan shahid hue hai, main aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum ki inaki shahadat vyarth nahin jaaegi
 The Government of the Bharatiya Janata Party will work more vigorously to decongest them by changing the strategy
 pradhanmantri, grih mantri or chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne bhi yah bharosa dilaayaa he
 i believe that our party has created so much credibility that the Bharatiya Janata Party government is capable of suppressing the anti-national forces
 sawaal-kya aapako lagata he ki naksal top leadership par sargical strike kaa vakt aa gaya he?jawaab-sargical strike shabd kaa prayog to sahi nahin he
 But harsh action can definitely be said
 sawaal-magar sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki aapaki sarkaar ko teen saal hone ko he
 Out of about 60 km of road, only 5 km is made up
 pichley 5 saal main se teen saal to aapke hi hai
 You talk of development
 vahiin 60 main se 5 kilometre, 5 saal main?jawaab-aap ek sadak ko mat pakadie
 Three thousand schools have been established in this area
 250 ke kareeb public health centre bane hai
 Secondary schools are built, small roads are built, and when a Nexus is built, it takes a strategic time to finish that Nexus
 lekin vahaan par sthitiyon main bahut teji se badlaav aa rahaa he, vahaan par hamaare mukhyamantri kaam kar rahe hai, mantri kaam kar rahe he, vahaan panchayat chunaav hua he
 All these things have been restored there
 vahaan prashasan pahunch chukaa he
 In the area from which the collector was picked up and taken away, at the same time, our Chief Minister has organized a huge public meeting of 30 thousand
 sthiti main bahut teji se parivartan aayaa he, lekin jab koi ghatana hoti he, to iske pariprekshya main saare prayaason ko vifal maananaa, meri drushti se sahi nahin he
 Question- During Manmohan Singh's government, 76 people were killed when there was an attack in Dantewada, then the report of the Rammohun Committee had written that what were the mistakes? When compared to the recent attack, the soldiers were sitting at the same place and were having lunch
 ek hi sadak kaa baar-baar istemaal ho rahaa tha
 It seems that the mistakes that happened in Manmohan Singh's time also happened after seven years
 jawaab-cameti report bananaa bahut saral hota he
 If the soldiers do not live together, they do not live
 unhen ek saath hi gasht lagaani hoti he or jab jawan khaanaa khaane baithe to unki suraksha kaa gheraa tha
 The Naxalites attacked the villagers further
 is vajah se jawan bhi pasopesh main rahe
 Villagers also have to worry about the soldiers
 mahilaon ko bandook kii nonk par aage laayaa gaya or sadak ek hi he
 There is a lot of difference between reports and ground situation

 Bharosaswal to overcome the situation in Kashmir - one was attacked in Chhattisgarh and the other in Kashmir
 kashmir ko lekar to duniya bhar me chintaa he or kuch logon ne to yahaan tak sampadakeey likhe hai ki kya kashmir bharat ke haath se nikal rahaa he? vahaan sthiti dinondin kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 What will you say on this question or concern? Answer - As long as there is a BJP government, Prime Minister is Narendra Modi
 koi sambhaavna nahin he ki kashmir bharat ke haath se nikal jaae
 Except this, there is so much awareness in India that no party should have a government, now Kashmir cannot be separated from India
 sampadakeey likhane kii swatantraaa hoti he, magar yah kabhi nahin ho saktaa
 This is a face and if we all try together, this face will also come out
 sawaal-kashmir main jo bhi hot samar kehete hai, wo har saal nahin hota
 After some time, such situations occur
 pichley saal jab burhan vaani kaa encounter hua, tab bhi sthiti kharaab thi
 Even now the situation is bad
 aapane bhi tasviir dekhi hongi
 Small girls and school children are taking to the streets against our soldiers
 jawaab-main yah nahin kahata ki yah chintaa kaa vishay nahin he
 This is a matter of concern, but it does not mean that we lose this battle
 sawaal- koi stritegi?jawaab-stritegi camere ke saamne nahin bataai jaati
 Question - Any message? Answer - Message
 piem ne diya he, vahaan kii mukhyamantri ne diya he, grih mantri ne diya he
 We will handle the situation
 ham sabake saath charchaa kar iskaa rasta bhi nikaalenge
 Our forces are also doing very well
 sawaal-aapako lagata he ki mahabuuba mufti sarkaar se gathbandhan kaa aapako phayda mila yaa aapako lagata he ki jo gathbandhan hua usamen kahin naa kahin gadabad hui?jawaab-mujhe lagata he ki is samay iskaa analysis karnaa uchit nahin he
 This should be done only when its period ends
 sawaal-baat sahi he, lekin aapako bharosa he ki kashmir kii sthiti kya kaabo main aegi?jawaab-nishchit rup se kaabo main aegi or kashmir majbootee ke saath bharat se judaa rahegaa
 Will the situation be overcome by military means or political dialogue? Answer - Both ways
 jab koi shastr uthaakar kaam kar rahaa he, to suraksha balon ko uskaa jawaab dena hi hoga
 You can't sit silent magar iske saath-saath kootnithik raste bhi khule hai or un par bhi prayaas ho rahaa he

 kejariwal kaa iviem japaswaal-dilli par aate hai, ye pehali baar dekha ki jo party harati he, wo haar hi nahin maan rahi
 Kejriwal or any leader of his party is not ready to believe that BJP won in Delhi
 ve to kah rahe hai ki iviem ne hamen haraa diya, modi or amit shah ne nahin haraaya
 Answer- Now it is an introduction of Arvind Kejriwal and his party that what kind of politics he believes in
 desh jab aaazaad hua tabase is desh main loktantric tareeke se bahut saare parivartan hue
 When any country accepts multi-party parliamentary democracy, then change is natural
 parivartan janata ke aadesh se hota he, janadesh se hota he
 We also lose
 dilli main ham haare thea to maine khud kejariwal ji ko badhai di thi
 But someone like Kejriwal recites the name Vishnu
 is vakt vah iviem kaa jaap kar rahe hai
 But i would like to remind them politely that this EVM machine was in 2015
 agar ye iviem mashin kharaab thi or bijepi sarkaar mainipulate kar rahi thi, to tab bhi yahi iviem mashin thi or yahi bijepi sarkaar thi
 What do you have to say about the majority of the 67 seats in that election? And if evms were tampered with, why did Congress win in Punjab and Mamata Banerjee in Bengal? Why did we lose in Bihar? We lost in Tamil Nadu
 kerala main communist jite
 Why did this happen? But i find it very strange not to accept defeat
 sawaal- wo kah rahe hai ki iviem ke khilaaf ham andolan karenge
 We are not defeated by Modi, but by evms
 jawaab-unhone to notebandi ke khilaaf bhi andolan kiya tha
 i think it is a result of that
 unka jo aprope he, kisi bhi cheez ko negative tareeke se sochna
 The people of the whole country are with Narendra Modi
 narendra modi sarkaar kii prashansa karti he, modi ji ke netritv main desh puri duniya main apni sthiti badhaane main safal rahaa he, is baat ko puraa desh maan rahaa he
 What will happen if you refuse? The kind of excuses and negative politics that Kejriwal made, i believe that he has a huge contribution in this defeat
 sawaal-itani badi haar ke baad aam aadmi party kii jo sthiti hui
 The place where they were and they fell
 kya kejariwal sarkaar bane rahane kii moral athurity kho chuki he?jawaab-main is par koi zyada tippanee nahin karnaa chahta
 i want to remind one thing about Kejriwal
 kejariwal kaha karte the ki rhite tu rikaal hona chahie
 i think the people of Delhi have shown Right to Recall very well
 sawaal-‘aap’ kaa aarope he ki bijepi unke vidhayakon ko todane kii koshish kar rahi he
 BJP leaders are in touch with more than a dozen 'AAP' mlas and the BJP is trying to break aap's MLA and the government falls
 jawaab- bijepi kii taraf se aisi koi koshish nahin kii ja rahi
 Interesting questions are giving answers that there is no effort from the BJP, but the people of AAP are in touch with you
 jawaab- bijepi kii taraf se naa koi aisa praayojan he or naa hi koi aisi koshish ho rahi he
 Question- Such speculations are being made that whatever happened in Uttarakhand, in Arunachal, the same Amit Shah will do in Delhi, will get the President rule, and will break the government of AAP
 jawaab-kahin par bhi baahar kaa aadmi koi aapaki sarkaar nahin tod saktaa
 Unless your party has a dispute
 sawaal-aapako lagata he ki ‘aap’ main dispute he?jawaab-mujhe nahin lagata he
 They would think, so saying in advance
 unke bayaan se lagata he ki unke yahaan koi dispute chal rahaa he
 Question- Do you think this is the beginning of the end of the Aam Aadmi Party or will it bounce back from here? Answer- Brother, i always believe in positive politics
 main dilli ke parinaamon kaa ek hi analysis karnaa chahta hum ki dilli kii janata bhi narendra modi main vishwaas rakhti he or bijepi ke saath he
 Question- You worked very strategically
 aapane dilli kii puraani puri emsidi team badal di
 Did you think that it is of no use? Answer- You say that the earlier MCD team of Delhi is of no use, it is not right
 main aisa nahin maanata, ye saare kaaryakarta kaam ke he
 Question- Then why were they removed and new faces were introduced in MCD elections? Answer - All these workers used to contest elections for 10-15 years
 emsidi kaa kaam karte the
 Now a lot of new workers have come in the party, so the party decided that the new workers should fight the elections and the old workers should take over the work of the party organization
 isko kisi kii quality ke saath yaa aaropon ke saath jodna thik nahin he
 Question- For many days, BJP was searching for Delhi, a face that could compete with Kejriwal
 hamaare agsit pole main kejariwal kii lokapriyata thi 25 pratishat or manoj tiwari kii 23 pratishat
 Do you think that you have found the face you were looking for in Bhojpuri Star in Delhi? Answer- See Manoj ji is doing well, he is popular, he is an artist
 purvaanchali he
 He has done a very good job in this election
 sawaal-kya ab jab bhi dilli main chunaav honge, to vah party kaa cheharaa honge?jawaab-ye kahana abhi bahut jaldbaaji hogi

 acha kaam kar rahe hai yogi, kanoon haath main lene waalon par kathor karrwaiswaal-sarprise factor to aap dete hai
 We saw that you brought Yogi Adityanath in UP
 isliye koi atakalbaaji nahin lagaai ja sakati
 Answer - In our party, decisions are taken after consideration
 haa ye baat alag he ki aapako in faislon kaa pataa nahin lagata
 Question- How do you see the work that Yogi Adityanath has done so far? Answer - He is doing a great job
 upi main unke liye chunauti bahut badi he
 The challenge is too big for the BJP
 jis prakaar vahaan prashasan kaa vidhwans hua, prashasan kaa sampradayikaran hua he or jatvaad main lipt ho gaye hai, usko sudhaarna himalay par chadhane jaisaa kaam he
 Yet Yogi ji is doing very well
 main ashanvit hum ki upi main acha parivartan aayega
 Question - But there were some such incidents in UP as well
 aaj tak ne ‘go rakshak part 2’ sting dikhaaya
 Even earlier, when Modi's statement came
 go rakshak ke naam par ye log camere par maan rahe hai ki ham pitayee karte hai, todphod karte hai
 The whole strategy is explaining that we break such legs, when the injury does not bleed
 taaki jab cese ho chhot jaaen
 Answer - See, all people are associated with BJP or our allied organizations, it is not so
 is prakaar ke tatv socity main hote hai
 You have full confidence that the BJP government will control all these things very quickly
 lekin ek hi paksh nahin hota he kanoon vyavastha kaa
 There will be a lot of improvement
 sarkaar banane se hi bahut sara sudhaar apane aap hua he
 The negative-positive message has gone to the public, it is not
 lekin isko maine halke se nahin liya he
 It is the responsibility of our party's government, it should be controlled
 khatm karnaa chahie
 Question- You are making a very strong statement, the Prime Minister had also made a very strong statement that there are 70 to 80 percent people who are committing hooliganism in the name of cow protection, but even then things did not go right? Answer - i Also said, do not just connect it with cow protection
 maine kaha he ki kisi prakaar ke kanoon haath main lene kii prakriya ko ham kathorta ke saath niptenge
 i do not need to give a commitment
 ye pehali sarkaar nahin he hamaari
 Our government is running in 13 states and we do it everywhere
 bahut achche se chal rahaa he

 tripal talaak par bijepi kaa najariya safasawaal-tripal talaak par aate hai
 You saw this as a big campaign
 hamane to yahaan tak dekha ki bahut sari muslim mahilaayein yogi adityanath ke janata darbar main aakar apni samasyaayein bataati hai

 Although Solar Eclipse is a celestial phenomenon and has scientific reasons but there are many religious beliefs about it
 manyataon ke anusaar grahan (eclipse) kaal main sutak rahata he or is dauraan kuch kaam nahin karne chahie

 vaise yah purna surya grahan bharat main dikhaai nahin degaa
 There will be night in India at the time of eclipse, so it will not have any effect here nor will there be Sutak period

 Let us tell you that on July 2, there will be a full solar eclipse in South America, the Pacific Ocean, South Central America and Argentina

 test siries main 3-0 se aitihaasik jeet darj karne ke baad team india vanade siries par bhi kabja karne ke iraade se maidan par utregi
 Team India, who finished third in the ICC ODI rankings, has many players who can be a big burden on the Sri Lanka team
 agar baat kii jaae maujuuda form kii, to team india kaa palada mejabaan srilanka team par baari he
 Also, Virat Brigade is a strong contender to win this ODI series
 haalanki jab pichhali baar donon timen aamane-saamne thi, to srilanka ne team india ko 6 wicket se karaari shikast di thi
 In the league match of Champions Trophy tournament, the host team gave a shock to the Indian team
 lekin us jeet ke baad srilankai team ab tak kuch khaas nahin kar pai he
 Let us tell you that Sri Lanka suffered a 2-3 defeat against Zimbabwe on their own home soil in July
 jiske baad us samay ke captain angelo maithyuj ne captaini se istipha de diya tha
 After Angelo Mathews, senior Sri Lankan batsman Upul Tharanga will now lead the Sri Lankan team in the five-match ODI series against India
 team indiyabharat ke paas viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, rohit sharma or mahendra singh dhoni jaise ballebaajon ke saath jasprit bumraah, bhubaneshwar or kuldeep yadav jaise gendbaaj bhi hai
 Both India's openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are in fine form
 donon khilaadiyon ne champions trophy ke dauraan shandaar ballebaaji kii thi
 KL Rahul, who batting the opening in Tests, will bat at number four in odis
 rahul ko vanade kaa zyada anubhav to nahin hai lekin ab tak khele 6 maichon main unhone 220 ran banaae hai jisamen ek shatak or ek ardhashatak shaamil he
 At the same time, he also performed well in the Test series against Sri Lanka
 mahendra singh dhoni, jo ki captaini chhodane ke baad or zyada khatarnaak ho gaye hai
 Dhoni scored 52 in 18 matches in the last one year
 54 kii ausat se 578 ran banaae hai
 Which includes one century and four half-centuries
 vahiin wicket ke peeche dhoni kii furti kaa koi jawaab nahin he
 India and Sri Lanka will maintain their dominance, so far 150 odis have been held between India and Sri Lanka
 isamen se bhartiya team ne 83 match jite hai, jabaki srilanka ko 55 main jeet mili he
 Of this, only one match was tied and 11 did not yield any result
 donon tiimon ke jeet ke aankade main team india kaa palada baari he
 One of the reasons why Team India can win this ODI series is its tremendous form
 srilanka or bharat vanade maichon membharat - 83srilanka - 55benatija - 11taai - 1kul - 150srilanka par mandaraaya world cap 2019 se baahar hone kaa khatrasrilanka team par 2019 world cap main sidhe taur par pravesh ke liye dabaav bana hua he
 Sri Lanka will have to win at least 2 odis against India if they have to enter directly for the World Cup 2019
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main jari isisi kii taaja vanade ranking main srilanka 88 ankon ke saath aathven sthaan par he
 If he wins two odis against India, he will have 90 points
 vanade ranking main 78 ankon ke saath nauven sthaan par kabiz westeindies team agar ireland ke khilaaf vanade siries va england ke khilaaf paanch vanade maichon main jeet hasil karti he, to uske paas 88 ank ho jaaenge
 Sri Lanka fear losing the West Indies in such a situation
 mejabaan england ke saath vanade ranking main sheersh saat timen sidhe taur par 2019 world cap toornament main pravesh karengi
 The Sri Lankan team has batsmen like Upul Taranga, Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, who have been performing brilliantly in odis for Sri Lanka
 srilanka kii gendbaaji kii baat karen, to uske paas lasit malinga jaise gendbaaj hai
