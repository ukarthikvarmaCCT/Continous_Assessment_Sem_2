 unhone kataaksh karte hue kaha ki wo hedline main nahin logon ke dilon main rahete hai
 The music that ran with time may be getting higher and varied, but it has become as fake as Chikankari kurta of Lucknow now
 rang bhi he, kaam bhi he
 Decoration too and the same semitransparent feel
 lekin aatma kahin nahin he
 All the songs swing like soulless skeletons
 jinpar aap apane avsaad or dambh bhunaane ke liye naach to sakate hai, sukun nahin paa sakate
 However, there are some opportunities for relaxation in Delhi
 ek sabase ahm avasar hota tha kisi bahaane, kisi aayojan main girija devi kaa aana or unhen gaate hue sun paanaa
 a sour and sweet ter-full voice that is no longer heard from the cheeks of the cheeks, is no longer heard from the throat of the urban women
 jiske liye waapas lautnaa hi padataa he ganga kii god main based ilaakon kii ore, gaanvon kii ore yaa gaanv ko apane pakke makaanon main samete shaharon kii ore
 Girija Devi had this voice with the smell of traditions, the taste of soil and the affinity like mother
 unako gaate sunata tha to man karata tha jaakar god main baith jaau
 One evening, listen to them, then there was a great hangover for weeks
 phir kitne hi din unke audio or you-tub link sunata rahata tha
 In this city, whenever disappointment starts dancing on the head, Bhimsen Joshi, Kishori Amonkar, Girija Devi and Kumar Gandharva tie the dhandhas
 raashid khan phir se nae praan bharte hai
 The stagnation in the voice of Girija Devi and the faith, truth, that was earned through long struggles
 parivaar, khaskar maa kabhi bhi iske paksh main nahin thim ki wo saarvajanik rup se jaaen or gaayen
 This society, which worships the Goddess with veena, looks at the woman singing very negatively
 lekin aatmavishvaas or sachai ke jariye girija har pratikulata se ladati hui gaati raheen
 This was also the strength of his voice
 darasal, girija devi kii aawaaj main ek tis bhari ter thi
 i heard the same ter every time in the shehnai of Bismillah Khan
 channulaal main yah ganwai yaa desajapan nahin he
 They are like flying fowl in Masan Holi
 shivamay, gambhir or mithe
 But this is the shehnai that is in the throat, not only Begum Akhtar and Girija Devi had luck
 akhtari bai to kab kii alavida kah gayi, ab girija bhi gavan baad sasuraal chali gayi
 It is now difficult to find the strength and stagnation of this voice in any other throat
 baaki log gaate hai
 Some learn from them or follow them
 lekin wo baat dusron main nahin he
 The rest are sweet, diverse, palatable
 par girija devi jaise gahare, thande, nirmal or tehraav katai nahin
 The departure of Girija Devi is like going away from a tradition of music to Annapurna of our time
 kaashi kii kahani bina annapurna ke puri nahin hoti
 And if Annapurna goes away without revealing her shadow life, then this is Kashi's departure
 sachmuch, sangeet parampara kaa ek kaashi aaj kho gaya, sadaa ke liye so gaya
 Meeting with acquaintances, friends and 'kasiwasi' of Banaras, it is discussed every time that where Kashi is going
 kashinath singh apane upanyaas 'kaashi kaa assi' main kehete hai ki kaashi dhire-dhire apni hansi, masti khota ja rahaa he
 dying slowly
 wo shaayad isiilie kyonki kaashi se tehraav khatm hota ja rahaa he
 For stagnation, Mamatva was required and Girija Devi looked iconic in the final reflections of Mamatva
 wo chali gayi to kaashi se ek anchal chhin gaya
 Where to stay now? or bina tehraav ke anand nahin aata, na aati he prasannataa
 Just undeserved grin can be dealt
 isliye girija devi kaa janaa keval sangeet kii ek parampara kaa avsaan bhar nahin he
 With Girija, Kashi seems to end everything that could have kept us better in the cyclone of time
 chaiti, jhula, kajri, thumari or sohar gane vaale kuch gale aasapaas khojane par mil bhi jaaen to girija vaali baat kahaan se milegi
 There was only one church
 akele channulaal ab kya-kya sanbhaalenge
 What will happen to Kashi now? maharashtra bijepi ke sankalp patr main saavarkar ko bharat ratna dene kii babasaduddin ovaisi ne nathuram godse ko bharat ratna dene kii kahi batol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin (eimm) ke pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne nathuram godse ko bhi bharat ratna dene kii baat kahi he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Owaisi said that how can it be thought of giving Bharat Ratna to a conspirator who killed the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 agar aap saavarkar ko de rahe hai tonathuram godse ko bhi bharat ratna den
 Asaduddin Owaisi said that if you want to give Bharat Ratna, then give Allama fazl-e-haq to Khairabadi, who was sentenced to black water, but did not write a mercy letter like Savarkar, but got hanged
 un logon ko bharat ratna dijie, jinhone resham patr andolan chalaaya or malta jail main apana jivan bitaayaa
 Owaisi said that if we want to present Nazir in front of our generations, then give Bharat Ratna to such people who fought the British and never apologized
 kya he maamla?bijepi ne apane sankalp patr main vir saavarkar ko bharat ratna dilaane kaa vaada kiya he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that his government will demand from the central government that Bharat Ratna be given to Veer Savarkar
 bataa den ki maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye 21 oktober ko matdaan kiya jayega

 On social media these days, an advertisement of shaving kit company Gillette is making headlines
 isamen mardon ko lekar tay steriotip soch par sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai
 While this # thebestmancanbe campaign of Gillette is being praised, it is being severely criticized as well
 aakhir real main (asli mard) koun hote hai? isko kaise paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he? amuman samaaj kii soch mardon ko lekar ek khaas khaanche main feet he
 Real men, in fact, are the men who, since childhood, bully their male boys
 unki kamajoriyon (padhein maasoomiyat) ke liye buli karte hue unhen kabhi, freeq to kabhi lujar kehete hai
 They confess in their minds that everyone hates them because they cry when they are sad
 wo ladakiyon se saath khelte hai
 They do not have the aggression, which is necessary for manhood
 jaise-jaise wo 'real main' bada hota he wo gussa karnaa sikh letaa he
 Shouts and shouts to get his voice heard
 use kabhi dard bhi hota he to wo zaahir nahin karata
 Not only at home, college, office, road, everywhere, it gives proof of their manhood by touching girls and touching them in a wrong way
 kabhi-kabhi to mardaangi itani taaqatvar ho jaati he ki apane saath kaam karne vaali auraton ko mahaz aisi nazaron se dekh letaa he ki wo asahaz ho jaati hai
 Not only that, 'real men' are also those who remain in the dominating position in any relationship
 chaahe baat shaadi, sex, bachche kii ho aakhir faisalaa unheen kaa hota he
 But this is the stereotype definition of real man
 haqiqat main to asli mard wo hote hai, jo samajhate hai ki koi kamazor nahin he unase
 They help those boys who are left behind due to any reason to be bullying
 baat chaahe skool, college, yaa plaground kii ho, wo sabko saath lekar chalane main vishwaas karte hai
 They stop their friends from teasing a girl on the street
 wo samajhaate hai apane dost ko ki yun raah chalati ladki ko chhedana galat he
 They raise their voice against any kind of injustice happening to a female colleague in the office
 wo rishton main barabari kii baat karte hai
 At home, they work together with wife, sister and mother
 wo period main unke liye chaay-coffee banaate hai
 Sometimes if your health worsens that of your partner, then you also press your hands and feet
 wo bacchon ke dyper badalane se le unhen doodh pilaane or kahani suna sulaane kii zimmedaari bhi bakubi nibhaate hai
 They cry when they are unhappy, keep their head in the mother's lap or by sticking to the arms of their mother-in-law
 ye hoti he kubsuurati mard hone kii
 But there are very few such men in this world
 or jo aise mard hai unhen unke mard saathi nicha dikhaane kii koshish karte hai
 a new advertisement from a shaving company probably seems to try to break this stereotype
 vigyaapan, jaahir he vigyaapan hi he
 But hidden emotions are important in this
 ki, bachapan se hi ham ladakon ke saamne aise udhaaharan pesh kare ki wo aage chal kar sabakaa sammaan karen
 Children are growing up to see us, so are we teaching them to be weaker than us, to tease girls, to touch them without consents in office, to molest them and to scream and get them to listen! But two days The men of a developed country like America are cursing this previously launched video
 unhen lag rahaa he ki ye video unki mardaangi par waar kar rahaa he
 Showing his musculine in the wrong light
 twitor se le instagram har jagah vigyaapan kii mukhaalafat ho rahi he
 Well-known journalist, writer and judge of several TV shows, 'pierce Morgan' tweeted on the Twitter handle, posting his protest on the ad, "let boys be damn boys
 Let men be damn men
 "one tweet can be gauged by how deep the traditional definition of masculinity is embedded in our minds
" zaraa sochiye hazaron utpaadon ke vigyaapan main auraton ko, parfect maa, khubasurat patni, dilkash garlfriend ke rup main dikhaaya jaataa he
 In almost every third advertisement, they are told that if you drink such and such tea, you will look lean, you will be blond with cream and so you will be called the best mother and wife by using such and such spices
 lekin kabhi auraton ne in par koi virodh nahin zaahir kiya, kyonki bachapan se hi ladakiyon ko yahi sikhaaya jaataa he
 Whatever they become, in the end, they have to take care of the house, they have to wash their clothes smiling in the washing, brighten the house, they have to become perfect by taking care of every happiness of the family
 aaj jab vahi bazarwaad in mardon ko zaraa sa aainaa dikhaane kii koshish kii he to is qadar virodh darz karavaaya ja rahaa he
 This is enough to show the depth of feudal thinking about men
 lekin jitna bhi virodh ho kushi is baat kii he mardon ke liye reiser or shaving kriim banane vaali ek company ne sterio-tip ke kilaaf ek muhim to chhedi
 In the last part of the advertisement, it was said, "how can we show our best form to our future generations till we men challenge ourselves to do better
" " ye baat ek ummid kii lau si jagaati he ki, jo ab aagaaz hua he, to baat kabhi na kabhi anjaam tak to pahunch kar rahegi!(anu roy swatantra lekhika hai or mahila adhikaron par likhti hai

 Last month, the Delhi High Court ruled that LG is the chief administrator of Delhi
 uske baad se hi lagata he ki aap kaa munh suja hua he or vah apni apil par supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 After that the party's cabinet minister Sandeep Kumar (now sacked) got involved in a big scandal and another party leader has been booked for molestation

 Sisodia also fiercely defends you on the issue of confrontation with LG and puts all responsibility on LG
 ve kehete hai, ''ham din-raat kaam kar rahe hai, par alji hamaare kaam main adnga lagaate rahete hai
 "sisodia denies that your relationship with bureaucrats is not good
 unka kahana he ki jang kii ore se un par dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he, jo phir modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko jawaab dete hai
 Column writer Santosh Desai admits that there is definitely some claim in aap's claim of targeting himself
 ve kehete hai, ''isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki unke paas kuch karne ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 
 
 They have fallen between the municipal corporation and the LG with an opposing attitude
 aap ko har kisi se laduya pad rahaa he, yahaan tak ki khud se bhi
 "there is also the danger that the government that makes big promises is becoming carefree about its functioning
 to kya voter sarkaar ke faislon main protocol kii kathith andekhi par alji kii vyarth jaanch par najar rakhen? yaa ve ek pangu sarkaar ko chupchaap dekhte rahenge?aap ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki kejariwal agar punjab ke liye dilli kii andekhi karte hai to thik bhi he
 "they have their hands tied in Delhi," he says
 aap agar punjab main jitati he to isse dilli main uski saakh badhegi or alji or bijepi ke liye baadha khadi karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 "sisodia says that as a party leader, it is meaningless to expect Kejriwal not to play an important role in the promotion of other states
" ve nireekshak kii bhoomika main hai, jaisaa ki mukhyamantriyon ko hona chahie
 They keep taking full information of administration from their ministers
 " dilli se aksar gaayab rahane ke kaaran kejariwal ke bare main raay banati ja rahi he ki ve dilli par zyada dhyaan nahin de rahe hai
 Ashutosh denies this
 "he has been out of Delhi a few times, he has only visited Rome once, visited Punjab and Goa a few times, and visited Gujarat only once
 " party ke mutabik, aisa nahin he ki uski ab dilli main ruchi nahin he
 The thing is that you have failed in your attempt, because the High Court verdict has given more rights to LG than the elected government
 lekin log to yahi dekh rahe hai ki party shaayad baadhaon se paar paane ke liye paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahi
 Sisodia says, "modi and BJP are angry with the people of Delhi and are taking revenge on them because of their rejection
" " kejariwal twit karte hai, ''siem or mantriyon ke paas ab koi adhikaar nahin he, yahaan tak ki ek kalam kharidne kaa bhi adhikaar nahin
 In the case of Delhi, the LG and the PM have all the rights
 " unke is aansu bahaane vaale bayaan main ek bebas aadmi najar aata he
 But Kejriwal has a reputation among the people of Delhi as a rash leader who led the party to a landslide victory
 aap or kejariwal ko apni vah pahchaan phir se banani hogi
 It will not be enough to say that everything is in the hands of Modi
 sibiai ne grih mantralay ke ek under secretary ke kilaaf bhrashtachar kaa maamla darj kiya he
 The CBI has also received ministry files from Anand Joshi's house
 afasar par aarope he ki wo videshi chanda niyaman kanoon yani epasiare (FCRA) ke maamalon se mili jaankariyon kaa istemaal enjio ko blackmel karne main karata tha
 Apart from this, ngos are also accused of manipulating files to get FCRA approval
 ab sibiai kaa kahana he grih mantralay se hi vasuuli kaa dhandha chal rahaa tha or is dhandhe ko is building se joshi hi chalaa rahaa tha
 According to the CBI, Anand Joshi used to issue FCRA notices to many ngos and used to recover money from them
 in sab ngos ko videsh se fnding milti he
 The CBI says that Joshi also got immovable property from some private companies as a bribe and Joshi used to take bribes from ngos by informing them about them
 grih mantralay ne ye maamla sibiai ko tab diya jab tista sitalwar ke NGO sabrang ke masale se taalluk rakhane vaali filein gaayab ho gayi
 Later files were also found
 joshi ke ghar se 7
 Apart from Rs 5 lakh, the files of the Ministry of Home Affairs and IB have been found which they could not take home
 niyamon ke mutabiq sanyukt ayukta or uske upar ke afasar hi fil ghar le ja sakate hai
 The comments sibiai ne joshi ke kilaaf bhrashtachar kaa kamala darj kiya he or uske ghar ke alaava teen jagah jisamen north blaak shaamil he - red bhi maari he
 On the other hand, Joshi's wife has made serious allegations against her husband's senior officer
 anand joshi kii patni minakshi ne kaha, "mere pati ko jhootha fansaaya ja rahaa he
 His seniors used to send files home through the driver
 ' Anand Joshi himself also admitted that his seniors were claiming him for giving him a clean chit to many ngos
 jab unhone apane senior kii nahin maani to unhen is maamle main fansaa diya gaya
 But the CBI dismissed these allegations
 subah sibiai kii team ne anand joshi ko saath lekar unke bank khaaton or lokaron kii talaashi lee
 Actually, this story is big because it tells how foreign companies work to change the decisions of the government by paying some money to the government babus and if it cannot be changed then the system can get information about how to rule it over Huh
 or kyonki grih mantralay main sabhi maamle kaafii samvedansheel hote hai, isliye ye maamla kaafii gambheer he
 Now the CBI says that the business of recovery was going on from the Home Ministry itself and Joshi was running this business from this building
 sibiai ke mutabiq anand joshi kai ngos ko FCRA kaa notice jari kar unase paise vasuul kiya karata tha
 All these ngos get funding from abroad
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki joshi ko kuch nijee companiyon se rishwat ke taur par achal sampatti bhi mili or joshi ngos ko unke bare main jaankaree dekar unase rishwat bhi letaa tha
 The Home Ministry gave the case to the CBI after the files related to the issue of Teesta Setalvad's NGO Sabrang disappeared
 baad main filein mil bhi gayi

 5 lakh rupee ke alaava grih mantralay or ibi kii filein mili hai jinhen wo ghar nahin le ja sakate the
 According to the rules, only the Joint Commissioner and above officers can take the file home

 When he did not listen to his superior, he was implicated in the case
 lekin sibiai ne in aaropon ko kaarij kar diya
 In the morning, the CBI team along with Anand Joshi searched their bank accounts and lockers
 darasal ye kahani badi isliye he kyonki ye bataati he ki kis tarah videshi companiyaan sarkari babuon ko kuch paisa dekar sarkaar ke faisale badalawaane kaa kaam karti hai or agar badalawa nahin sakati to system ko kaise over rule kiya ja saktaa he iske bare main jaankaree hasil karti hai
 And because all the matters in the Ministry of Home Affairs are very sensitive, this matter is very serious

 You have often seen hanging calendars at home, offices, schools or elsewhere
 lekin aapako ye jaanakar hairaani hogi ki madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle deevaaron par tangane vaala yahi calendar in dinon vivaadon main he
 In the MP capital of Bhopal, the MP Congress has even demanded a ban on calendars
 aapako bataa den ki ye koi maamuli calandar nahin balki ye shaskeey calendar he, jise lekar in dinon madhya pradesh congress pareshaan he or usne chunaav ayog se maang kii he ki shaskeey calandaron par bain lagaaya jaae
 The Madhya Pradesh Congress has written a letter to the Chief Election Commissioner of the Central Election Commission, requesting it to ban government calendars
 madhya pradesh congress ke media prabharee maanak agarwal ke mutabik madhya pradesh sarkaar ke saal 2018 keshaskeey calendarke har panne par mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii photo to he hi, saath hi usamen sarkaar kii taraf se chalaai ja rahi yojanaon kii jaankaree bhi he
 According to Manak Agarwal, about one and a half million callers are hanging in different government offices and houses all over Madhya Pradesh which may affect the upcoming election
 iske alaava pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat gharon ke mukhya dwaar par lagaai ja rahi tiles par bhi congress ne aitraaj jataayaa he
 According to the standard, the tiles being installed in homes under the PM Awas Yojana have pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and all government calendars and tiles should be banned before the elections, keeping in mind the possible code of conduct in October
 
 is maang ko bijepi ne bataaya, 'congress kii kuntha'congress dwaara shaskeey calendar or piem awaas yojana kii tiles par pratibandh kii maang ko bijepi ne congress kii kuntha bataaya he
 Madhya Pradesh bjp's chief spokesperson Deepak Vijayvargiya told Aaj Tak that the Congress party has been out of power at the Center for four years and out of Madhya Pradesh for 15 years
 janata ke bich ye kabhi gaye nahin, isliye surkhiyon main bane rahane ke liye or prachaar ke liecongress partihameshaa satta ke liye ashrith rahi hai or isliye congress jab satta se baahar hoti he to use kuntha hoti he
 Deepak Vijayvargiya said that the government has its own methodology that how to make its plans available to the public, those who lead the government also have a role
 isliye congress ko unase irshyaa yaa kuntha nahin honi chahie, jahaan unki sarkaar he vahaan unka netritv unki yojanaon ko aage badhaata he to is kuntha se congress ubre or janata ke bich jaae
 Working in the kitchen and then cleaning it thoroughly is both art
 kai log aise hote hai jo khaanaa banane ke dauraan puure kichan ko failaa dete hai
 At the same time there are some who work in a systematic way
 isi tarah kai log aise hote hai jo kaam khatm karne ke saath hi kichan ko saaf kar lete hai par kuch aise hote hai jo upree safai to kar dete hai lekintiles or farsh kii safai chhoddete hai
 In such a situation, it is important to keep in mind that instead of the hard work you are saving today, you will have to sweat more in the future
 roj-roj safai karte rahane se gandagi jamati nahin he or kichan jaldi saaf ho jaataa he
 You can make your work easier by dividing the kitchen cleaning into two parts: 1
 rose kii safai-apane kichan main roj pochha lagaaein
 You can use detergent or a disinfectant in the wipe water
 yah dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki jis kapade se aap pochha laga rahi hai wo ganda na ho
 It is also necessary to clean it after use
 -yadi aapke ghar main chitiyon kii fouj he to pochhe ke pani main namak daalkar pochha lagaaein
 -if you are cleaning your floor after a few days, then wipe with hot water
 -achche nattejey paane ke liye, pochha karne ke baad usee farsh par ek sukha pochha karen
 This will keep your floor shiny and will not get dusty
 -yadi aapke farsh par kuch gir jaataa he to use turant saaf karen
 Doing this will not cause stains
 2
 Cleaning the tiles: If you do not clean your kitchen tiles everyday, then cleaning one day can put you in trouble
 hamaare ghar main hi kai aisi chijen maujuud hoti hai jinke istemaal se ham kichan ke tiles ko aasaani se saaf kar sakate hai:-sirka2 kapasirka or 2 cap pani kaa mishran bana karek saaf spray bottle main daal len
 Spray it on the tiles and clean it with a micro fiber cloth
 micro fibre kapadaa duusare kapade kii tulana main, gandagi ko achche se sokh letaa he or isse sataha par kharonch bhi nahin aati he
 - By using baking sodabeaking soda, you can get rid of stains easily
 baking soda or pani kaa ek motaa paste bana len or use daag par laga den
 Let it dry for 10-15 minutes and then wipe it with a wet cloth
 yadi yah daag ziddi he, to kisi puraane toothbrush se saaf kar sakati hai
 - Bleach or ammoniaid If your tiles are very dirty, then mix bleach and water in equal quantity
 is mishran ko sataha par golakaar mudra main lagaaein
 Now clean the tiles with hot water
 iske baad kisi sookhe kapade se ise saaf kar len
 Do wear gloves when using bleach

 Kunjo Singh bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke khyalaat ek baar phir se milte nahin dikh rahe hai
 While Nitish congratulated Chidambaram for the budget, Narendra Modi said that the government was completely cut off from the public
 bajet bhaashan main vishesh rajya kaa darja ke liye vartmaan maandand main badlaav kii baat ko saidhantik jeet qaraar dete hue mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne vitt mantri chidambaram ko badhai di
 Nitish Kumar said, Bihar has long been demanding to change the old norms for special state status
 kendriya vitt mantri ne bajet bhaashan main vishesh rajya kaa darja ke liye vartmaan maandand ko parivartan kii baat kahi he or siddhant taur par sweekaar kiya he ki vishesh rajya ke maandand main parivartan kii jarurat he
 This is a theoretical victory for the people of Bihar
 chidambaram badhai ke paatr hai
 It is hoped that this theoretical declaration will be implemented
 modi hue naarazwahin gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne aam bajet ko lekar centre sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Modi said that this budget of the central government will increase inflation and unemployment further and the general public will have to bear the brunt of it
 upie sarkaar par prahaar tej karte hue narendra modi ne kaha ki is bajet or 12veen panchavarshiya yojana ke bich koi taratamya najar nahin aata he
 Also, there is no strategy to increase the growth rate

 ' medical or ejineering pravesh pariksha paas karne vaale chaatro ko sambodhit karte hue kapil ne kaha ki iske liye sirf pratibha kaaphi nahin he tathaa iske liye kariyar kii yojana bananaa bhi ahm he

 India's first World Cup winning captain said, 'but it happened
 aisa ho rahaa he or puraa bharosa he ki aisa hoga
 The records are meant to be broken
 sachin ne itnaa bada karnama kar diya he ki agar koi bhi ise nahin todega to maanav jati pichad jaaegi
 We are waiting for the day when someone will break Sachin's record
 ’ Addressing the students who pass the medical and engineering entrance exams, Kapil said that talent is not enough for this and planning a career is also important for this
 medical or ejineering pravesh pariksha paas karne vaale chaatro ko sambodhit karte hue kapil ne kaha ki iske liye sirf pratibha kaaphi nahin he tathaa iske liye kariyar kii yojana bananaa bhi ahm he

 According to a news report published in the English newspaper The Hindu, Giriraj Singh said that about 16 per cent of the world's population lives in India and in our country every year the population of Australia increases

 He had said, 'our country Hindus do not need to increase the population
 unhen apni jansankhya ke masale ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie, kyonki desh ke aath rajyon main hinduon kii jansankhya ghat rahi he'
 Prior to this, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has also given the opinion that Hindus should increase their population

 Like the batting runs of Sachin's batting, congratulatory messages started pouring in on micro-blogging sites Facebook and Twitter, and a period of interesting jumps has begun
 ek vyakti ne sachin ke shatak or aam bajet par chutki lete hue fasebuk par likhaa, ‘pranab mukherjee kaa aam bajet dhime vikaas, nitiyon kii gatiheenata or kai anya chizon main funsane ke baad sachin tendulkar ke haathon bold ho gaya
 ' sachin ke ek prashansak ne fasebuk par likhaa, ‘aam aadmi ko dada ke bajet se zyada sachin ke 100wein shatak se raahat mili
 Comments isi tarah, sachin ke bangladesh main shatakon kaa shatak banane par bhi jumalon kaa daur jari he
 Another fan of Sachin wrote on Facebook, 'sachin's hundredth century dedicated to General Arora

 yah sanghathan bijepi ne hi shadyantra ke tahat banwaaya he or isaki aad main bhi apni dalit-virdohi maansikta vaali ghinauni raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Significantly, the Chief of Bhima Army Chandrashekhar on Saturday made a road show in the Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency and realized his power

 " The Reservation Bill has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha in the midst of loud uproar

 mayawati ne kaha ki essi evam asti ke liye yah kaaphi mahatvapurn vidheyak he isliye sabhi dalon ko chahie ki vah ise miljulkar paarit karaaen
 Many political parties in the country do not want the Reservation Bill to be passed in Parliament
 in dalon main shivasena or espi pramukh hai
 Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has even said that this bill is completely unconstitutional
 hangaame ke bich sapa sadasyon ne samvidhan (117waan sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2012 pesh karne vaale carmik, prashikshan evam lok shikaayat rajya mantri ve narayansami kii ore badhane kaa prayaas kiya

 Even before the Bill was introduced, there was a lot of buzz in the House

 Meanwhile, Naresh Agarwal of SP and Avatar Singh Karimpuri of BSP got caught up in each other
 karimpuri ne na keval agarwal balki sapa ke anya sadasyon ko bhi asana ke samaksh jane se rokane kaa prayaas kiya
 Karimpuri tried to hold Aggarwal's hand which was opposed by Agarwal and other SP members
 baad main basapa ke sadasyon ne karimpuri ko shant karaayaa
 After this, SP members gathered before the seat and started shouting slogans opposing reservation in promotions

 After a challenging year spent by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), the new year begins with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh joining Ardas in Harmandar Sahib
 vah ravivaar subah vah harmandar sahib main mattha tekenge
 The pavilion is the most important in a Hindu marriage
 mandap kaa matlab mahaj aam ke pattey laga phoos kaa chappar bhar nahin hota, iske saath sakshi hote hai ve devtaa jinhen aavahan kar bulaayaa jaataa he or vah nae jivan main pravesh karne vaale var-vadhoo ko apana aashirwad dete hai or unke vaivaahik bandhan ke sakshi banate hai
 Now, as the traditions have become modernized in the era of change, the impact on the pavilion is also being seen
 isi aupchaarikta ke chalate ab radimaid mandap kii maang bad gai he
 a person who has become a part of high-tech and bhagam-bhaag life, has now started incorporating rituals in his own style
 dharmik reeti-rivaajon ke mutabik shaadi kii rasmon kii shuruyaat mandap se hoti he
 For this, the priest decides the day and time
 uchit samay par gaade gaye mandap shaadi hone ke baad shubh muhoort main sasamman visarjeet hote hai
 It is believed that on the auspicious occasion of marriage, all the gods reside under the pavilion on the call of the priest and open the doors of a happy married life for the married couple
 ek vakt tha, jab kanyapaksh ke bich mandap ko lekar behad utsakutaa or jimmedaari kaa bhav rahata tha
 The pavilion was so decorated that the elders of the house used to prepare for it
 aisi manyataayen samaaj main prarambh se maani ja rahi hai
 But the effect of the change that has come with time is that today people have prepared the second formula of the pavilion
 badhati aabaadi, sikudte makaan or simit jagahon ke kaaran mandap kahin marij haul ke kisi kone main redimaid tareeke se khadaa kiya ja rahaa he, to kahin khule maidan main aisi jagah mandap banaaya ja rahaa he, jahaan sirf var-vadhoo paksh ke simit log hi maujuud rah saken or baaki jagah shaadi kii duusari vyavasthaaon, stage or cataring ke liye istemaal kii ja rahi he
 Actually, the pavilion is now being left behind and all the charm of the wedding is being reduced to 'jaymal' and DJ
 vahiin pheron ke liye ab mandap aupchaarikta bhar rah gaya he
 Along with other wedding arrangements, the tents are also entrusted with the task of the pavilion, the artisans of which get ready to walk the pavilion in minutes
 shaadi ke baaki intjaamon ko lekar bhale hi kanya paksh ko chintaa ho, lekin aamtaur par mandap ab chintaa kaa vishay nahin banataa
 At the same time, in the ceremonies of dowry-free marriages, hundreds of pavilions are asked for wholesale price and all the pavilions rise after the marriage ends
 paramparaon se ho rahe khilwaad par pan
 Krishnadeva Shukla says that people are forgetting the importance of the mandap and are inadvertently messing with religious traditions
 isse vaivaahik jivan main dushwariyaan aa sakati hai, lekin ativyast jivan style main samay kii kami ke kaaran log vikalp talashne lage hai
 According to Shukla, the use of readymade pavilions is not conventionally appropriate
 khaastaur se jaise-jaise iskaa vyavsaayeekaran ho rahaa he, vaise-vaise parampaparaayen peeche chhootati ja rahi hai or mandap bhi khanaapurti kaa hissaa banate ja rahe hai

 Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangla Samiraweera said, "I really don't know what kind of circumstances the submarines came to Colombo on the same day when the Japanese Prime Minister (shinzo Abe) visited Sri Lanka but we will ensure that in our tenure any Such incidents should not happen from the corner
 ’’ Samaraweera held talks with Prime Minister Li Qing and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his visit to China
 unhone kaha ki purv raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe ke kaarykaal main paanch arab dollar ke chini nivesh ko lekar srilanka kii kuch chintaaen hai
 The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister said that all issues will be discussed after the government reviews the projects being carried out at the moment
 unhone kaha ki china sarkaar ke saath in muddon par charchaa ke liye srilanka kaa ek ucch stareey dal baad main china kaa daura karegaa
 Last year, a Chinese submarine visited Colombo twice, raising concerns in India
 samarvira janvari main hue chunaav main rajpakshe ke haarane ke baad se china ke daure par gaye pehle srilankai adhikari hai
 The new Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena will also visit China next month

 jiya ko us kitaab main us ek line par aapatti thi jisamen kaha gaya tha ki pakistan ke paas duniya kii behtareen fouj he jo ek jang bhi nahin jeet pai
 These walls can tell you better than a scholarly thesis or the story of a journalist that there is a special place in the hearts and minds of the Pakistani people, which cannot be faced by any other country

 See the stories of Major Shabbir Sharif Shaheed (fazilka Sector), Pakistan's greatest hero in that war
 unhen maranoparant nishaan-e-haidar ke alaava sitara—e-jurrat (vir chakra ke baraabar) se nawaja gaya he
 There is a legend about him, which is also associated in government history that he challenged an Indian Major (narayan Singh) to fight face to face and won in it
 baad main vahaan bhartiya sainik zyada pahunch gaye to ve maare gaye
 Now let me tell you what every Pakistani wants to tell right away

 In this way, the image of every military chief in Pakistan is raised all the time

 jaraa gaur kiijie ki kaise neshnal assembly main aatankwaadiyon ke liye faujee adaalaton ke gathan kaa kanoon lagbhag nirvirodh tareeke se paas ho gaya
 Consider also how fast the pending execution of executions was carried out
 philhal pakistan is maamle main sabase upar he, saudi arab se upar
 This year 53 have been hanged in Pakistan while 48 in Saudi Arabia
 agar koi shaq-shubahaa rah gaya tha to unhen peshawar main faujee afasaron ke bacchon kii hatya ke baad dafna diya gaya
 The mood in Pakistan has changed completely now
 fouj hi ekmaatr aisi sanstha he jiskaa aadar sabase zyada he or phogiyon kaa sammaan pakistan ko bachaae rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Now the only difference is that they are fighting with their own people
 beshak, yah jang asli he or isamen faujee shahid bhi hue hai

 The relevance of comparing the stories of Jung with India's war history is not just to show that it is legitimate and illegitimate, but rather how the military has dominated the Pakistani mind

 Obviously, there was an Indian in front of every Pakistani war hero and he deserves the same respect

 One night in September 1965, the Indian Army was demolished at Barki village in a fierce battle on both sides and in 1971, the Pakistani army was stopped from mounting in Fazilka

 Also keep in mind that this thinking has transformed Pakistan into the most powerful national security state in the world, which is always skeptical and attentive to its backyard
 vahaan dimag puri tarah faujee daleelon kaa gulam ho chukaa he
 After all, what is this national security state? Listen to the argument of General Jahangir Karamat, the most academic head of the Pakistani army (1996 to 1998)
 2012 main islamabad main institute of riginal studies ke ek seminar main unhone bataaya ki aisa rajya jahaan rashtriya bajet kaa sarvaadhik hissaa suraksha par kharch ho or jahaan samrik chunautiyaan arthvyavastha, samaaj yaa shiksha sabhi ke upar aanki jaae
 He said that initially India was following this path but later it changed the course
 beshak, bharat kaa raksha bajet lagaataar do pratishat se neeche rahaa he or jidipi ke badaae ke saath uskaa aakaar ghatata ja rahaa he
 Pakistan's GDP is stable but its defense budget 3

 But it was most accurately interpreted by my friend, former Pakistani ambassador, commentator and now his most important exile politician Hussain Haqqani, for over three decades
 unhone kaha, ''har desh, pakistan samet, ko ek majboot or acchhee fouj kii jarurat he
 But notice that if you go to the gym and exercise by lifting weights with one hand, you will grow strong muscles in one hand but the rest of the body will remain weak

 But this debate is only in a group of small and meaningless English-speaking liberal intellectuals
 yaa jaisaa ki mere ek or puraane rajnatik dost ne lahore main bataaya ki pakistani kanoon ke anusaar dohari naagarikta ko manjuuri he jahaan desh ke elite lahore or landan yaa dubai main apana ek-ek makaan rakh sakate hai

 After this, on 2 January 15, the Moradabad Crime Branch team came to Patna under the leadership of Inspector Sarve Chandra, questioned both brothers, but Inspector Sarvachandra said that if the matter is to be scrapped, then give 10 thousand rupees, if not hang it Will take UP

 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dange ke ek maamle main dastaveji sakshya ke taur par america adaalat main apane passport kii prati jamaa karne se inkaar kar diya he
 For this, he has cited the denial made by the Government of India on the basis of personal security and privacy
 america district jaj bryan kogan ne pichley maheene sonia gandhi se 7 april tak kisi tarah kaa dastaveji saboot dene ko kaha tha
 So that the court can confirm their presence in America
 adaalat kaa yah aadesh sikh for justise (esaje) naamak sanghathan kii ore se daayar mukademe ke silsile main aayaa he jisamen daawa kiya gaya he ki jab sonia gandhi pichley saal sitambar main apni swasthya jaanch karaane ke liye kathith rup se shahar ke memorial slone-cataring cancer centre main ain thim, tab unhen saman bheje gaye the
 The case against Sonia is based on whether she was sent summons on September 9, as claimed by the organization and whether she was not in the US at the time, as she claims
 esaje ne 1984 ke dangon main kathith bhoomika ke liye camel nath, sajjan kumaar or jagadish titalar samet congress party ke netaaon ko mukademe se bachaane main kathith bhoomika ko lekar sonia se kshatipurti kii maang kii he

 He said, just as the secret service and diplomatic security agents of our government are required to keep their methods and methods confidential, the Indian authorities have to do so in relation to the people whose security they are in charge of
 batra ne kaha ki sonia gandhi apane khilaaf sanghathan dwaara daayar mukademe ko antim str tak pahunchaakar iske samaadhaan ke liye harsambhav sahyog karne ko taiyaar hai baavjood iske ki vah america main nahin thim

 dilli waalon par ek baar phir mahangaai kii maar padi he
 When petrol became cheaper by three rupees, the journey of the passengers became easier, but for those who do not have their own car or bike, it became difficult to travel in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ne auto or taxi kiraye main badhotaree kar di he
 After this decision of the government, now in Delhi, as soon as the auto meter is down, instead of 19 rupees, you will have to pay 25 rupees for the first two kilometers
 pehle shuruaati kiraaya 19 rupaya lagata tha jo badhkar 25 rupee ho gaya he
 After the first two kilometers, a fare of 19 rupees had to be paid
 uske baad prati kilometre 6 rupee 30 paise dene padate the, lekin ab bade hue rate ke baad logon ko saadhe chah ke baad aath rupaya dena padegaa
 Similarly, the fare for general taxis has increased from Rs 11 per km to Rs 14 and AC tax has increased from Rs 13 per km to Rs 16
 pichley dinon kiraaya badhaane kii maang or police utpeedan ke khilaaf aato chaalkon ne rajghat par pradarshan kiya tha

 desh ke sabase bade sarkari aspataal or medical research santhaan ames ne doctoron kii ritairement kii umr 65 se badhaakar 67 kiye jane kaa prastaav cabinet ko bheja he, lekin enditivi india ko pataa chalaa he ki is prastaav ko na keval jaldbaazi main bheja gaya, balki tay prakriya kii andekhi bhi kii gai or is prastaav se ames faikalti main naaraazgi he or association ne umr badaye jane ke prastaav kaa kadaa virodh kiya he
 While it is good to hear the proposal to increase the retirement age of AIIMS doctors from 65 to 67, experienced doctors will serve for two more years, but a letter written by the AIIMS faculty to Health Minister JP Nadda has given this proposal Brings questions
 ames faikalti association yani fames kii ore se health ministar jepi nadda ko ek chitti ( jisaki ek copy enditivi india ke paas he) isi maheene 19 taarikh ko likhi gai
 This letter states that, "after the end of term, the re-appointment of some senior AIIMS doctors on contract with full rights is in agreement with the institute's autonomy and working environment"
 lekin is chitti ke likhe jane ke do din baad hi 21 oktober ko ames kii mahatvapurn gavarning or institute body kii meeting main doctoron kii sevanivritti kii umr do saal badhaane kaa prastaav cabinet ko bhej diya gaya
 AIIMS today has around 800 doctors
 anbhavi doctoron ko ames main rokna phydemand ho saktaa he, lekin jaankaar bataate hai ki yahaan doctoron kii retarment kii umr badhaane kaa ye prastaav chand doctoron ko hi phayda pahunchaata he
 In fact, after the retirement of some senior doctors, questions were raised on the contractual appointment, then the proposal was sent to the cabinet only
 padtaal bataati he ki ames main radiotherapy department ke vibhaagadhyaksh dow jike rath (jo ames ke rotary cancer research santhaan ke pramukh or neshnal cancer santhaan ke bhi pramukh hai) kii sevanivritti ke baad unhen sabhi adhikaron ke saath theke (contract) par teen saal kaa ekstansion sidhe appointment cameti of cabinet ne diya
 Many AIIMS doctors consider this as compromising the autonomy of the institution
 iske baad hi ames kii do mahatvapurn samitiyon gavarning body or institute body kii baithak 21 oktober ko hui
 It is believed that this meeting is to open the way for the re-appointment of many other retired senior doctors, so that the extension of doctors can be given legal recognition
 jo sawaal uth rahe hai unamem pramukh ye he ki prastaav ko vitt mantralay, echaradi mantralay or carmik mantralay ke paas mashvire ke liye bheje bagaiyr hi sidhe cabinet ko kyon bhej diya gaya?tippaniyan The truth is that after the proposal is passed, senior doctors sitting on the posts of heads of important departments will remain there for many years, due to which there is resentment and frustration among the young doctors
 buudhvaar shaam ko ames faikalti association ne ek press relies ke jariye sarkaar se maang kii ki ritairement kii umr tabhi badhaai jaae, jab vibhaagadhyakshon ke liye roteshan policy bhi lagu ho
 That is, the HOD should be changed after the fixed time
 apni chitthee main association ne kaha he ki is bare main ames kii sarvocch samitiyon (gavarning body or institute body) ne 2012 main hi aadesh jari kiya hua he, jise sakhti se lagu kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The questions sent to the PMO and the Health Ministry regarding this to NDTV India were not received, but the doctors of AIIMS wrote a letter to the Health Minister saying that giving consent to such a proposal was in collusion with the doctors and ministers of the institute will increase
 haalanki, ames ke doctoron kii ritairement kii umr 65 se badhaakar 67 karne kaa prastaav sunne main bada acha lagata he ki anbhavi doctor do saal or yahaan sevaayen denge, lekin swasthya mantri jepi nadda ko ames kii faikalti kii ore se likhi gai chitthee is prastaav ko sawaalon ke ghere main laati he
 a letter to the health minister JP Nadda (a copy of which is with NDTV India) was written on the 19th of this month by the AIIMS Faculty Association
 is chitthee main kaha gaya he ki, 'kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad ames ke kuch senior doctoron kii puure adhikaron ke saath theke par dubaara niyukti karnaa santhaan kii autonomi or kaam karne ke maahaul ke saath samjhauta he'
 But two days after this letter was written, a proposal to increase the retirement age of doctors to two years was sent to the cabinet at the AIIMS important governing and institute body meeting on 21 October
 ames main aaj kareeb 800 doctor hai
 It may be beneficial to stop experienced doctors in AIIMS, but experts say that this proposal to increase the age of retirement of doctors here only benefits a few doctors
 asal main kuch senior doctoron kii ritairement ke baad theke par kii gai niyukti par sawaal uthe to use baad hi ye prastaav cabinet main bheja gaya
 The investigation reveals that after the retirement of Dr
 GK Rath, head of the Department of Radiotherapy Department at AIIMS (who also heads the Rotary Cancer Research Institute of AIIMS and National Cancer Institute), he got a three-year extension on the contract with all rights Direct appointment was made by the Committee of Cabinet
 ames ke kai doctor ise santhaan kii swaittata se samjhauta maan rahe hai
 Only after this, the meeting of two important committees governing body and institute body of AIIMS was held on 21 October
 mana ja rahaa he ki ye baithak kai duusare ritair ho rahe senior doctoron kii phir se niyukti kaa rasta kholane ke liye he, taaki doctoron ke ekstansion ko kanoonee manyata mil sake
 The main questions that are being raised are why the proposal was sent directly to the cabinet without sending it to the Ministry of Finance, HRD and the Ministry of Personnel for consultations
 sach ye bhi he ki prastaav ke paas hone par kai saalon se mahatvapurn vibhaagon ke pramukh ke pad par baithe senior doctor vahiin jame rahenge, jisase yuva doctoron main naaraazgi or hataasha he
 On Wednesday evening, the AIIMS Faculty Association, through a press release, demanded that the retirement age be extended only when the rotation policy for the Heads of Departments is also applicable
 yani tay samay baad echodi badale jaaen
 In its letter, the association said that AIIMS 'highest committees (governing body and institute body) have issued the order in 2012, which needs to be strictly implemented
 is bare main piemo or health ministry ko enditivi india kii ore bheje gaye sawaalon ke jawaab nahin aae, lekin ames ke doctoron ne swasthya mantri ko chitti likhakar ye kaha he ki aise prastaav ko sahmati dena santhaan main doctoron kii netaaon or mantriyon ke saath sathganth ko badhayega

 (link dekhne ke liye yahanclikaren) The rulers of Pakistan always have the power to eliminate terror and terrorism from their land
 magar vahaan aatank kii lahalhati fasalon ke bich se kabhi daaud, kabhi hafiz said, kabhi masood azhar or kabhi saiyad salauddin kaa cheharaa jhaankta nazar aata he
 In such a situation, all the claims of Pakistan are hollow
 saiyad salauddin ko america ne beshak international aatankavadi qaraar de diya ho magar pakistan kii zid he ki wo to inhen paalega
 It has not been long since the US has tagged the Global Terrorist tag on Hizbul Mujahideen Chief Syed Salauddin's forehead
 or ab der saver baari uske aatanki sanghathan hijbul mujahidin kii bhi aa gai
 Which was declared a terrorist organization by the US State Department
 america kshetra main aane vaali uski sampattiyon ko jabt karne ke aadesh kar die gaye
 Obviously, this step of America has brought new troubles not only to Salauddin and his terrorists, but also to Balkipakistan
 vajah saafe he, ab tak pakistan naa sirf salauddin balki uske sanghathan ko bhi kashmir kii azaadi ke liye kaam karne vaale logon kaa sanghathan bataata rahaa he, lekin ab america ke is faisle se saafe ho gaya he ki duniya ko uski in daporshankhi baton par koi aitbaar nahin
 In such a situation, the question is, what will be the impact of this decision of America on these terrorists and their leaders, then the answer is simple that now the gangsters of terror are surrounded
 ab hijbul ke liye kashmir ke naam par fund jutanaa pehle kii tarah aasaan nahin hoga
 People who work for him abroad will tighten the screws and their accounts will be sealed
 hijbul ke cheef salauddin par pehle hi kai tarah kii paabandiyaan hai, sampatti zabt ho chuki he
 India will still have more ease in taking action against the Hizbul terrorists
 All US citizens' relations with Hizbul will also be stopped
 aise main ye kaha ja saktaa he ki ye paabandiyaan beshak america kii taraf se ai hai, lekin ye bharat ke liye apane-aap main ek badi jeet he
 The last time when PM Modi was going to America, just a day before that, Salauddin was declared as tainted by the US and now when the matter was talked about with Modi, the decision came on the very next day
 yahaan zicre-khaas he ki america ke is faisale se ab hijbul bhi al kaayda, iesas, boko-haraam ke alaava lashkar-e-taiyyaba or jaish-e-mohammad sareekhe pakistan se chalane vaale duusare aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii qatari main khadaa ho gaya he
 In such a situation, it is also a good opportunity for India to try to declare Syed Salauddin and Hizbu l Mujahideen as International Terrorists and International Terrorists Organization in front of UN Security Council 
 hindustan se lekar pakistan or pakistan se lekar america takaatankwaadiyonki ulti ginati chaalu he
 The only difference is that India and the United States want to move forward this count while Pakistan wants to stop it
 tabhi to pichley choubees ghanton main pakistan kii pushto-panaahi main palane vaale dehshatgardon par dabl atake hua he
 On one side, while the US has put Hizbul Mujahideen as an international terrorist organization, on the other side, another Lashkar commander in the valley was put to death
 hindustan ke khilaaf zehar ugalane se lekar koon kharaba karne vaale aatankwaadiyon ko ek saath do-do jatke lage hai
 While the US declared Hizbul Mujahideen as an international terrorist organization, security forces in the Valley have put another lashkar-e-taiba commander to death
 uskaa naam tha ayub lelhari
 Yes, he was an enemy of humanity
 lekin kashmir kii azaadi ke naam par begunaahon kaa koon bahaane vaale sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyyaba kaa yahi commander buudhvaar ko hindustani fuj or suraksha balon ke jaal main kuch aisa fansaa ki phir laash banakar hi azaad hua

 Kalyan Singh's rise in trouble as he was removed from the post of Governor is accused of conspiracy of demolition, BJP leaders including 13 leaders of BJP were CBI, Shikanjarajasthan's former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh as soon as he stepped down from the post of Governor and took BJP membership
 Trouble is growing
 babari masjid vidhwans maamle main kalyaan singh ko bataur aaropee phir se court main pesh karne ke liye sibiai ne adaalat main arji daakhil kii he
 However, Kalyan Singh had so far been exempted from legal action in this case for his constitutional post under Article 351
 sibiai kii yachika par supreme court ne 19 april 2017 ko aadesh diya tha, jisamen kalyaan singh ke alaava is cese main purv dipti piem laal krishna adwani, bijepi ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi, purv siem uma bharti, sadhvi rutambhraa, mahant nritygopal das, vinay katiyaar, satish pradhan, chanpat raay bansal, vishnu hari daalamia, nrity gopal das, satish pradhan, aarvi vedanti, jagadish muni maharaj, biel sharma (prem), dharm das ko aaropee maanate hue mukadmaa chalaane kii baat kahi thi
 Barring Kalyan Singh, the remaining accused have been granted bail by the court
 in saare netaaon ke khilaaf ayodhya main babari vidhwans ke liye aapraadhik shadyantra karne kaa aarope he, jo dhara 120 (bi) ke tahat chal rahaa he
 Now after CBI accepts the appeal, Kalyan Singh may have to face legal difficulties once again
 bataa den ki ayodhya maamle ke liye librahan ayog kaa gathan 16 disambar 1992 main kiya gaya tha
 The commission, in its report, termed the Babri demolition as a planned conspiracy and convicted 68 people
 librahan ayog ne kaha tha ki kalyaan singh ne ghatana ko rokane ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Please tell that Kalyan Singh was the Chief Minister of UP at the time of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992
 aarope he ki upi ke siem rahete kalyaan singh ne rashtriya ekta parishad kii baithak main kaha tha ki vah ayodhya main vivaadit dhaanche ko koi nuksaan nahin hone denge, lekin car seva yojit hone ke dauraan ayodhya main masjid ko gira diya gaya tha
 After this CM Kalyan Singh resigned from his post taking responsibility of the case
 saal 1993 main kalyaan singh ke khilaaf sibiai ke aaropapatr ke baad 1997 main lakhanu kii ek vishesh adaalat ne apane ek aadesh main kaha tha, 'kalyaan singh ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vah sunishchit karenge ki vivaadit dhaancha puri tarah surakshit rahe or use dhahaaya na jaae, lekin unhone kathith taur par apane vaadon ke vipareet kaam kiya
 At the same time, the CBI had also alleged that Kalyan Singh did not order the use of central force as the Chief Minister
 vishesh adaalat ne kaha tha, 'isse pratham drushtya yah maaloom padataa he ki vah aapraadhik shadyantra main shaamil the
 This is the reason why the Supreme Court had asked the CBI to produce Kalyan Singh as an accused soon after his removal from the post of Governor
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 361 ke tahat raashtrapati or rajyapalon ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan aapraadhik tathaa divaani maamalon se chhot pradaan kii gai he
 Accordingly, no court can issue summons to the President or Governor in any case
 kalyaan singh ko 3 sitambar 2014 ko rajasthan kaa rajyapal banaaya gaya tha
 Kalyan was not summoned by the court for 5 years
 vahiin anya aaropee netaaon ko court main apil ke baad is cese main jamaanat de di gai
 Now after Kalyan's membership of BJP, a petition has been filed in the court of the special judge of the CBI court
 kendriya jaanch agency kii ore se daayar yachika main kalyaan ko dobaaraa court main pesh karaane ke liye anumati maangi gai he

 In such a case, according to section 120-B 1860 of the Indian Penal Code, if found guilty in this case there is a provision for a maximum sentence of three years

 " JD (U) state president Vasistha Narayan Singh has welcomed rjd's support
 unhone kaha, "hamane samarthan nahin maanga he agar koi raajnneetik dal samarthan detaa he to yah us dal kii swatantraaa he
