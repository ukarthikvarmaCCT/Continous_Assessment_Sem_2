 rohingya sharnaarthiyon par sarkaar ke rukh par sawaal khadey karte hue varisht congress netaa tarun gogoi ne kaha ki rohingya sharnaarthiyon ke saath bhedbhaav ho rahaa he
 How far intolerance is true in Mahatma Gandhi's country
 tarun gogoi congress ke varisht netaa hai or teen baar assam ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 He said that refugees are being discriminated against on the basis of religion and it is the people who are being tortured
 gogoi ne kaha ki unke desh main unke maanavadhikaar kaa hanan ho rahaa he to vah dar ke vahaan se bhaag kar bharat aa rahe hai, jo rifuji aayega to vah avaidh hi hoga, lekin vah jaanboojhkar yahaan nahin aa rahe hai
 Former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi says that this is the country of Mahatma Gandhi and Ashoka, we have to show generosity
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne supreme court main jo halafanama diya he usamen sarkaar kaa rukh ninsaphi bharaa he
 The Government of India brought the Citizen Amendment Act in 2015, in which we will give citizenship to any minority refugees in countries around India
 unhone kaha ki bharat sarkaar dhruvikaran kar rahi he or rohingya masale ko lekar myanmar bhi to padosi desh he agar vahaan se sharnaarthi aa rahe hai to unke saath bhedbhaav kyon kiya ja, kya isliye kyonki wo musalmaan hai
 Gogoi, in favor of the Rohingya Muslims, said that we are not saying that Rohingya should be given permanent citizenship, but the Rohingya can be sheltered as long as the environment is not suitable for them in their country
 gogoi ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ko rohingya ko waapas bhejne ke liye myanmar kii sarkaar se baat kerani chahie
 In the government's affidavit, Tarun Gogoi said that if there is a Rohingya terrorist, then you take action against him, arrest him, so far no such person has come, if you do, then take action against him, but women and children should also take the same Why are you standing in the dock, children who have neither arms nor gunpowder, what could be their fault

 congress netaa randeep surajevaala ne abhinayta aamir khan par die gaye bayaan ko lekar raksha mantri manohar parrikar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Parrikar had said on Saturday that Aamir Khan's statement of intolerance leaving the country was full of arrogance
 surajevalane twit kiya ki manohar parrikar se sabit hota he ki ye dalita or alpsankhyakon ko dabaane kii sajeesh he
 Could it be 'raj Dharma'? Surjewala also raised the question, 'is Manohar Parrikar's job is to protect India's attackers like Pakistan or threaten a citizen of his country like his mentor Aamir Khan?' Gokhale's book was told in the release program, an actor has said that his wife wants to go out of India
 yah dambhpurn bayaan he
 If i am poor and my house is small, i will still love my house and will always dream of making it a bungalow
 ’
 @ manoharparrikar's statement proves a concerted conspiracy to curb all dissent, hound Dalits & Minorities
 Can this be the 'raj Dharma'?— Randeep s Surjewala (@rssurjewala)july 31, 2016jeenyu main deshvirohi narebaaji kii kathith ghatana kaa paroksh rup se zikr karte hue parrikar ne kaha tha, ‘kaise kuch logon ko desh ke virodh main bolne kaa saahas ho jaataa he
 Such people, who speak against the country, need to be taught by the people of this country
 ’is@manoharparrikarjob to protect India from external aggressors like Pakistan or threaten fellow countrymen like actor Aamir Khan?— Randeep s Surjewala (@rssurjewala)july 31, 2016 In a democratic country like India, elections have always been a complex process
 ise saral banane ke liye chunaav ayog electronic voting mashin (EVM) kaa prayog karata he
 So that the election process can be completed quickly
 haalanki iviem kii transperesi ko lekar aksar raajnneetik log sawaal uthaate rahe hai, lekin abhi tak yah aadhikarik taur par nahin kaha ja saktaa ki iviem ko hack kiya ja saktaa he
 The Election Commission has also denied this
 iviem kii thodi bahut jaankaree voter ko hoti he
 For example, how to vote? How does it work? But most people do not know which party candidate to place in EVM
 yani kis number par koun se candidet kaa naam hoga? aakhir candidet kaa naam mashin main kis kram main rakhaa jaataa he? yah jaankaree dene se pehle ham aapako yah bataa dete hai aakhir EVM kaam kaise karti he?bharat main 1982 main pehali baar EVM kaa istemaalazaadee ke baad hamaare desh main sattar ke dashak tak ballat paper se hi chunaav hote the
 EVM was used for the first time in the country in elections in May 1982
 kerala ke paraavur vidhansabha ke 50 matdaan kendron par iviem se logon se vot daalaa
 The candidate who lost the election on A
 si
 Jose had challenged the election and results from the EVM in court
 jis par court ne phir se chunaav kaa aadesh to de diya, lekin mashin main tempring kii ashanka nahin jataai thi
 evms were not used for some years after 1983
 supreme court ne iske liye kanoonee praavdhaan kaa aadesh diya tha
 In December 1988, Parliament amended the law and added section 61A to the Representation of the People Act, 1951
 is section se chunaav ayog ko chunaav main voting mashin istemaal karne kii takat mili
 The evms that were manufactured in 1989–90 were used in the November 1998 assembly elections
 ise madhya pradesh ke 5, rajasthan ke 6 or rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli ke 6 vidhansabha kshetron main prayog ke taur par istemaal kiya gaya tha
 After this, small elections were conducted through evms
 2004 main ai iviem krantibharat main 2004 main iviem se chunaav hue
 evms were used in the elections to the 14th Lok Sabha in the country
 matdaan kendron par 17
 5 lakh machines were kept
 2004 ke baad se saare chunaav iviem ho rahe hai
 How evms work? An EVM consists of two units
 pehali control unit or duusari belatting unit
 Both units are connected by a 5 meter long cable
 control unit booth main matdaan adhikari ke paas rakhi hoti he jabaki belatting unit voting mashin ke andar hoti he jiskaa istemaal voter karata he
 The program used for the control unit is inserted into a microchip
 micro chip main daalane ke baad us program ko na padhaa ja saktaa he, na copy kiya ja saktaa he or na hi isamen chhedchhad karke kuch badla ja saktaa he
 After the election, the polling officer closes the EVM by pressing the 'close' button
 'close' batan dabaane ke baad iviem puri tarah se band ho jaati he or iske baad koi batan kaam nahin karti he
 The presiding officer then separates the two units
 vot balting unit main surakshit ho jate hai
 After this, the votes cast in the evm's 'result' button are displayed at the time of counting
 yah batan sealed hoti he or bina close batan dabaae yah kaam nahin karti he
 How many candidates in an EVM? Voting can be done for a maximum of 64 candidates in an EVM
 yani ek mashin main 64 candidet kaa naam darj kiya ja saktaa he
 Actually, voting can be done for 16 candidates in a balloting unit and no more than 4 balloting units can be connected to a control unit
 agar ummidavaaron kii sankhya 64 se zyada hoti he to phir chunaav ayog ko ballat se chunaav karana pad saktaa he
 At the same time, the name of 384 candidates can be fitted in the M3 EVM made after 2013
 haalanki ise abhi chunaav ayog ne apane bede main shaamil nahin kiya he
 How many votes can be cast? Only 3,840 votes can be cast in an EVM
 darasal, bharat main ek matdaan centre par matadaataaon kii sankhya 1,500 se zyada nahin hoti he
 Accordingly, an EVM is sufficient for a polling station
 kahaan banati he iviem?iviem kaa dizin chunaav ayog ne sarkari kshetra kii do companiyon-bharat electronics limited (BEL), bengalooru or electronic korporation of india limited (ECIL), hyderabad ke saath milakar kiya he
 evms have been finalized after considerable drill
 kai baar iske namoonon kaa pareekshan hua or vyapak paimaane par field trial kiya gaya
 Now evms are being manufactured by BEL and CIL
 ek iviem par kitna kharch?1989-1990 main jab mashiinon ko kharida gaya tha to us samay ek iviem kii keemat 5,500 rupee padi thi
 Although it cost a lot in the beginning, it was cheaper than a ballot
 lakhon ballat kii chapai, unke bhandaaran or parivahan par bahut kharch karnaa padataa tha
 a large number of employees had to be deployed to maintain the ballot
 yani kul milakar ballat kaaphi mahangaa sauda tha
 evms have an inverted battery
 ise oparate karne ke liye kisi tarah kii bijli kii jarurat bhi nahin hoti he
 Which candidate is named at which number? We told you what EVM is? How does it work How many votes are cast and how many candidates can fit their name in it? etc etc
 ab ek sawaal uthta he ki iviem main koun se candidet kaa naam kis number par rakhaa jayega? ye kaise tay hota he? haal main begusarai loksabhaa seat se sipiem ke ummidavaar kanhaiya kumaar ne akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar unhen jitaane kii apil kii thi
 It was also written in the advertisement that a number of evms press the button and vote
 iske baad se soshal media par bhi logon ne khub sawaal kiye the ki kanhaiya ko kaise pataa ki unhen iviem main pehla sthaan milegaa
 While this the Election Commission decides
 alag-alag rajyon ke liye alag tareekaise par kuch logon ne kaha ki yah party ke hisaab se tay hota he
 Some said that alphabet is decided on the basis of A, B, C, D
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 The name of the candidate in EVM is determined by the language of that state
 yani agar vah rajya hindi bhashi he to vahaan par hindi varnmaala ke hisaab se iviem main naam likhe jaaenge
 In the Devanagari script of the Hindi alphabet, names are decided by a, b, c, d
 isiilie kanhaiya kumaar ne vigyaapan main iviem main pehle number par khud ko rakhkar vot maanga tha
 In this seat, Giriraj Singh and Mahagathbandhan of BJP have made Tanvir Hasan their candidate
 giriraaj or tanwir hasan ke naam ke akshar hindi varnmaala main kanhaiya se baad vaale akshar hai
 When questions were raised about the security of EVM and VVPAT EVM, the Election commission decided to put voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) with it
 ise lagane ke baad voter vot jis candidet ko vot detaa he uski slip vivipat mashin main dikhti he
 However, this slip is not given to the voter, nor is the identity of the person voting on it

 We will follow whatever the high command decides

 hamen kabhi ye gumaan bhi nahin hua ki gandhi hamaare alaava kisi or ke bhi ho sakate hai
 Gandhi may have been a Congressman from the beginning, he wanted to end the Congress after attaining independence
 vaise unki is ichha ko puraa kar dete to hamaari pahchaan kya hoti, yah sochakar hi puure sharir main siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 These new Prime Ministers, who had never seen the face of Parliament before becoming Prime Minister, changed the entire complexion of celebrating my Gandhi Jayanti
 ab ye sabhi ke gandhi ho gaye
 Surprisingly, the Gandhi who used to blame him suddenly became dear to him? Gandhi became everyone? Does Gandhi now mean BJP? Swachhta Abhiyan to replace Sarvadharma? Now Congress' copyright on Gandhi ends
 gandhi hamaare party kii sabase badi puunji thi
 We started with everything from them
 log hamase alag hote chale gaye
 Hundreds of parties were born from the Congress, but no one took my Gandhi away from us
 lekin jo party hamase alag hokar nahin bani usne gandhi par apana kabja jamaa liya
 That too without any rust
 
 
 naa vaicharik, naa hinsak
 All changes in the path of non-violence
 to kya gandhi ji congress ko samaapt kar, nai party bana kar, satta hasil karne kii baat karte the to vah party bijepi hoti? yaa phir ek khaas pradesh se hone ke kaaran gandhi hamase chhin gaye?khayr gandhi itane mahaan vyaktitv vaale rahe hai, jinaki pahchaan vaishvik str kii rahi, unhen ham aakhir kab tak baandh kar rakh pate
 Had to be separated from us today or tomorrow
 itnaa bada desh jo he, itani badi aabaadi jo he
 There cannot be a party with only 44 seats for Gandhi
 unhen to sara desh maanata he
 He belongs to everyone
 lekin du:kha is baat kaa he ki ab sirf hamaari party ko gandhi ke naam par raajnneetik phayda nahin mil paaegaa
 Now another participant has arrived
 is maamle main ham abhi ubar bhi nahin paae the ki hamaari durga yani indira kii shahadat darkinar karne kii koshish kii gai
 This was utterly unfair with our party
 patel hamaare the
 We used to give advertisements on his birth anniversary every year, then where did this running thing come from? puure desh ko dauda diya
 What a wonderful morning, he used to pay attention to the strength of the place and remember Indira ji
 use bhi inaki party ne chota kar diya
 It is now being heard that Chacha Nehru will also take away from us and celebrate Indira's birthday in her own way
 yah bhi jaankaree mil rahi he ki nehru kaa janmdin manaane ke liye jo cameti manmohan singh ne banaai thi, jisamen sonia gandhi bhi shaamil thim, use bhang kar nai cameti banaai gai he
 Sonia Gandhi is not in that committee
 aakhir yah kaise ho saktaa he
 Nehru belonged to our family, when did he start being with BJP
 hamaari gaddi hamase chin liye, ab hamaare purakhe bhi hadap rahe hai
 Change is the law of nature but no political party will change its way, face and character in such a way, i am not sure
 main bhi soch rahaa hum, jab hamaare saare purakhe bijepi ke ho jaaenge to akele congressi galiyon main aawaara ghoomane se mujhe kya hasil hoga? wadra sahab kii tarah gusse main kuch kar baithun to vah bhi thik nahin
 For them, the whole family will be together, who will be mine
 main mike bhi nahin hataa saktaa, wo to camera band karne or footage delit karne ko bolkar chale bhi gaye, main kya karuunga? kuch patrkaar mitron se puchhawata hum agar rahul baba bijepi main chale to main bhi paala badalane kii sochuun
 After all, something has to be done on Rajiv ji's birth anniversary too

 Limayamadhu Limaye, who was the pioneer of non-congress politics, was an essayist and activist of India's socialist ideas, who was particularly active in the 1970s

 UP does not like it now? But before this event, the opposition has received a strong blow
 darasal, congress ne uttar pradesh main aagaamee sthaneey chunaav apane dam par ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 This has once again exposed the opposition's schism

 So if the party is to be revived in the largest state of the country, then it would be better to go alone in the local elections
 raaj babbar ne media ko bataaya, ''hamane yah faisla kiya he ki aane vaale nagar nigam chunaav main congress bina kisi party ke saath gathbandhan kiye hi ladegi
 This thing also applies to the Samajwadi Party i

 It reached the Anglicia line via Nadesar, Chaukaghat, Alaipur Golgadda, Pilikothi, Vishweshwarganj, Madagin, Lahuravir, Maldahia
 kamalapati treepathi ke pratimaa sthal par pahunchakar puraa hoga
 The Congress President will also give a message in a brief address to the gathering group
 road sho safal ho, iske liye congress ke sabhi netaa apni takat jhonk di he
 Overall, the preparations are on to win UP from Banaras and the party has started encircling the BJP along with the socialist government on many other issues besides the issue of law
 shila dikshit kahati hai ki aaj jo upi kii haalat he vah behad kharaab he
 UP is the largest state, development is in the last category
 kanoon vyastha thik nahin bulandshahr main jo kuch bhi hua, behad sharmnaak he
 We condemn it
 is tarah kii ghatana hoti he to samaj sakate he lau and order kii sthiti kisi he
 There is no electricity, hence unemployment
 27 saal pehle congress kaa shashan tha
 Our slogan is '27 years bad condition'
 ye dil main chot pahunchaata he
 This is why we are from Uttar Pradesh too
 hamaari sarkaar jab ban jaayegi to sabake vikaas kii baat hogi 
 We want to realize that we will improve the condition of the state
 isiliye sonia gandhi aa rahi hai, yaheen se aagaaz karenge
 Significantly, one of the special things in this roadshow will be that Sonia Gandhi will probably garland the statue of Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Lal Bahadur Shatri, Kabir and Kamalapati Tripathi for the first time in Benares
 saafe he ki uttar pradesh ke chunaav main congress koi 'ghar' chhodana nahin chaahati
 Sheila Dixit says that the condition of UP today is very bad
 upi sabase bada state he vikaas antim shrenee main he
 Law and order is not right, whatever happened in Bulandshahr is very shameful
 ham isaki ninda karte he
 If this kind of incident happens, then you can understand how is the law and order situation
 yahaan bijli nahin he, lihaaja berogari he
 Congress was ruled 27 years ago
 hamaara naaraa bhi he '27 saal bura haal'
 It hurts the heart
 ham uttar pradesh ke he isaliye bhi
 When our government is formed, there will be talk of development for all
 ham ye ehsaas dilaanaa chaahate he ki ham rajya kii haalat sudhaarenge
 That is why Sonia Gandhi is coming, she will start from here
 gauratlab he ki is road sho main ek khaas baat yah rahegi ki sonia gandhi shaayad pehali baar banaras main ambedkar, mahatma gandhi, sardaar patel, laal bahadur shatri, kabir or kamalapati treepathi kii pratimaa par maalyarpan karengi
 It is clear that the Congress does not want to leave any 'house' in Uttar Pradesh elections
 madhyapradesh main shauchalayon kaa doosraa upyog bhi ho rahaa he
 This may raise questions in your mind, but this is the reality
 yahaan nayaa maamla aayaa he shauchalay kaa rasoi ke taur par upyog kiye jane kaa
 There is no kitchen space for children to cook in an Anganwadi center in Silanagar Pokhar in Karaira development block of Shivpuri district and the toilet was converted into a kitchen
 bacchon ke liye isi shauchalay main niyamit taur par bhojan banataa he or bacchon ko parosa jaataa he
 Princess Yogi, an activist of the Anganwadi Center, said that it is true that food is made in a part of the toilet here, because they do not have any separate place to cook

 According to sources, Vipin also told that besides Kartarpur Corridor, he was also asked to give information about the Army establishments, instead of which he was promised a million rupees

 According to news agency pti-language, media coordinator of Uttar Pradesh Congress Rajiv Bakshi claimed that Youth Congress workers of the Congress showed black flags to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani, who visited Uttar Pradesh and also raised slogans against him
 unhone bataaya ki police ne kareeb 150 kaaryakartaaon ko hiraasat main le liya, lekin unhen baad main reeha kar diya

 vahiin apane sarkari awaas par mukhyamantri yogi ne roopaani kaa swaagat kiya
 The two Chief Ministers are being told that the attack on the recent North Indians in Gujarat, the unveiling program of the Statue of Unity, the country's first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister's statue on October 31, and the one near the Bharatiya Bharat Complex near UP Bhavan There was talk about allocating land for dilli ke power coridor main teen sabase shaktishaalee thikaanon par agar kabhi ek saath kisi kaa kabja rahaa he, to vah hai arun jetali(arun Jaitley)
 He is the leader in the Modi government who got a chance to sit together in the North and South blocks and Udyog Bhawan in Raisina Hills
 north block or udyog bhawan menaaj bhi vah bataur mantri viraaj rahe hai, haalankiab dephence ministry unke paas nahin he
 He runs the Corporate Affairs Ministry from Udyog Bhavan

 There was speculation that Prime Minister Modi, who is facing opposition and internal attacks on the issue of economy, could give another ministry by quitting his post as Finance Minister, but returning to the post of Finance Minister again after three months, Jaitley has not only criticized critics Closed, but gave evidence of strengthening his hold in the Modi government
 arun jetali or modi ke sambandhon ko kareeb se jaanane waalon ke liye yah koi achraj kaa vishad nahin tha
 He knew that Modi would never want to tease Arun Jaitley against his will
 in sabake peeche ek pramukh vajah he, vah arun jetali kaa piem modi kaa 'mistar bharosemand hona'
 He has had close relations since before Modi came to Delhi

 There are allegations of lack of talented ministers in the current Modi cabinet compared to Vajpayee
 aalochak kehete hai ki arun jetali sahit kuch hi mantri aise hai, jiname raajnneetik hi nahin har tarah kaa chaaturya najar aata he
 Those who take part in the two-point debate and instead of trolling, make a shield of arguments and take to the field
 arun jetali vartmanmodi cabinet ke sabase talented mantriyon main se ek hai
 a big role in this is the longstanding advocacy in the Supreme Court

 Many leaders were seen standing behind Modi on Jaitley's lobbying

 In 2005, Sohrabuddin Shaikh's famous encounter happened

 No other top BJP leader had made a statement in favor of Modi

 He also used his contacts well in every field

 In his letter, Arun Jaitley accused Hareen Pandya of trapping the BJP related leaders through the encounter case from Sohrabuddin, Ishrat Jahan, Sohrabuddin etc

 Many BJP leaders do not hesitate to accept that if Narendra Modi considers anyone after Amit Shah to be the most close and reliable, he is Arun Jaitley
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ke zyaadaatar faislon main arun jetali kii sidhi bhoomika najar aati he
 Arun Jaitley is behind this belief to support modi-shah in times of crisis
 jaankaar yah bhi bataate hai ki jab may, 2014 main narendra modi satta main aae to ek prakaar se vah dilli ke liye 'outsidar' hi the
 Even though he was the Chief Minister three times in a row, he knew the color of power, but was well aware that Delhi is not Gandhinagar
 yahaan kii chaal-dhaal kuch alag hi he
 Narendra Modi was looking for a person in his cabinet who knows the mettle of Delhi and Lutyens zone
 unki yah talash arun jetali par jaakar tikti thi
 This is the reason why he was made the Finance Minister even after he lost the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar
 dephence or karporate afares ministry bane
 He was a minister in the Modi cabinet who got the chance to sit in the North Block (ministry of Finance) and South Block (defense Ministry) simultaneously
 yah unamem modi ke bharose kaa subut he
 Every year in Bihar, the Chaurammal Jayanti is celebrated with pomp in Mokama by the Dalit community
 lekin shanivaar ko jab is samaaroh main bhaag lene kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan or bihar ke up mukhyamantri susheel modi pahunche to kaale jhandon se unka swaagat kiya gaya
 a large number of people from the Dalit community gathered in the ceremony
 jaise hi paswan or modi pahunche unhone kaale jhande dikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 Despite all the appeals of the organizers, he did not calm down
 tab ramvilas paswan ne mike liya or kaha ki jab tak ve jinda hai koi aarakshan par anguli nahin uthaa saktaa
 He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said in a meeting that reservation will end on our corpse
 iske baad paswan ne logon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki dalit act se sambandhit maamle main centre sarkaar kii apil ke baad jald sunwaayee hogi
 When Sushil Modi stood for the speech, he shouted slogans of 'echoing earth skies, Ram Vilas Paswan' for about two minutes
 lekin unhone apana bhaashan bheed kaa gussa bhaanpate hue jald khatm kar diya
 However, Ram Vilas Paswan appealed to the people to listen to Sushil Modi
 is samaaroh main daliton ke rukh se lagata he ki philhal kai muddon par keval aashwaasan se ve maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 However, Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi are also going to attend this event on Sunday at the same place
 samaaroh main badi sankhya main dalit samudaay ke log jamaa the
 As soon as Paswan and Modi arrived they started showing black flags
 aayojakon kii tamaam apilon ke baavjood ve shant nahin hue
 Ramvilas Paswan then took the mic and said that as long as he is alive no one can point fingers at the reservation
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek mulaakaat main kaha he ki aarakshan hamaari laash par khatm hoga
 After this Paswan assured the people that the case related to the Dalit Act would be heard soon after the appeal of the central government
 susheel modi jab bhaashan ke liye khadey hue tab unhone kareeb do minute tak 'guunje dharti aasmaan, ramvilas paswan' ke naare lagaae
 But he soon finished his speech, sensing the anger of the crowd
 haalanki ramvilas paswan ne logon se susheel modi ko sunne kii apil kii
 The attitude of Dalits in this ceremony shows that at present, they are not ready to accept many issues with just assurance
 haalanki ravivaar ko isi jagah par is kaarykram main bhaag lene ke kiye vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi bhi ja rahe hai

 jisamen 4 alag-alag kahaniyon ko mashhoor diarectors anuraag kashyap, joya akhtar, dibaakar banerjee, karan johar ne diarect kiya tha
 Now once again these 4 directors together have directed 4 different stories for the series of Netflix
 jise last stories naam diya gaya he
 How is this series, let us review
 
 Zero Teaser: The first story of Nache Salman, Bole- Eid Mubarak Kahani and performanceseries is Teacher Kalindi (radhika Apte) and Student (akash Thosar) after taking Shah Rukh Khan in the lap
 jinke bich prem sambandh to he lekin kai saare utaar chadhaav bhi aate hai
 The story is directed by Anurag Kashyap
 ye kahani bahut real frem main shoot kii gayi he, jo ki anuraag kaa style bhi he
 Direction is good, the story could have been better
 saath hi editing bhi behatar kii ja sakati thi
 In this story, Akash Thosar seems quite nervous and appears misfit
 kahani main golden era ke 'dam bhar jo udhar munh phere ' gane kaa bakhubi prayog kiya gaya he
 The dialogues are good and this story also makes you laugh
 radhika apte ne phir se acha abhinay kiya he
 The second story of the series is directed by Zoya Akhtar
 jo mumbai ke ek medium class varking bachaler ajit (nil bhupalam) or uske yahaan kaam karne vaali naukaraani sudhaa (bhoomi pednekar) kii he
 There is a different equation between the two and the twist in the story comes when Ajith's parents come to Mumbai from Meerut and fix their relationship
 kahani acchhee he
 Bhumi Pednekar has performed well and Neil Bhupalam's acting is also smooth
 haalanki clymex thodaa behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Direction, camera work and storytelling are good
 # luststories @netflix_in # 15thjune @anuragkashyap10 @zoieakhtar # dibakara post shared bykaran Johar(@karanjohar) onjun 10, 2018 at 1:17am pdtsadzakom par sanju ko kyon maangani padi thi bheekh? diarector ne kiya khulhasateesri kahani main pati patni or wo kaa angel dekhne ko miltaa he
 Where the husband is Salman (sanjay Kapoor), Reena (manisha Koirala) as the wife and Sudhir (jaideep Ahlawat) as the wife
 salmaan or sudhir kaa kya rishta he or lav-last kaa kya hisaab kitaab he, uskaa pataa siries dekhakar hi chal paayegaa
 Director Dibakar Banerjee is mostly known for Dark Films
 lekin is baar rishton kaa taana bana darshaate hue najar aaye hai
 Background score and direction are excellent
 jayadeep ahlavat natural acting karte hue dikhaai dete hai
 At the same time, the work of Manisha Koirala and Sanjay Kapoor is also good
 Sanju Song Release: drugs ne aisi kar di thi sanjay kii halatchauthi kahani ke nirdeshak hai karan johar
 With whose presence, this story brings drama, emotion, laughter jokes and entertainment with love, lust
 kah sakate hai sabase badhiya kahani unhone sunai he
 Rekha (neha Dhupia), who handles the school library, often lectures her accompanying teacher Megha Verma (kiara Advani) to be bold
 isi bich shaadi ke liye jab megha ladkaa dekhne jaati he to uski mulaaqaat paras (vicky kaushal) se hoti he
 Meanwhile, there are a lot of twist turns in the story
 kiyaara or vicky kaushal ne behtareen abhinay kiya he
 Justified the story
 diarection, cinemetography or gaanon ke saath saath becoground score kamaal kaa he, karan johar kii film 'kabhi kushi kabhi gam' kii jhalak bhi aapako milti he
 In a way, this story is better than all the stories
 naukari ke liye intervyuu dene se pehle kya aapane kabhi company profile ke bare main jaankaree khangaali he? agar nahin, to aage se aisa kar ke jaaen, kyonki isse naukari milane kii guarantee bad jaati he
 It has been generally observed that recruiters prefer to hire the same people who know more and more about the company
 ham aapako bataate hai ki intervyuu dene se pehle company ke bare main kaise research karen:1
 Research the company's website: Before giving an interview, please check the website of the company at least twice
 isse aapako pataa chal jayega ki company kab bani, iske products kaise hai, kis disha main company gro karnaa chaah rahi he
 After getting information about all these, it will be easy to give interviews
 2
 Get information from linkedin: Nowadays most companies maintain a linkedin profile
 ise dekhakar bhi aap company ke bare main jaankaree hasil kar sakate hai
 3
 company ke campeteter website ko scan karen:aap company kii anya campeteter website se bhi us disha main jaankaree hasil kar sakate hai, jis disha main company kaam rahi he
 This will make it easier to give you an interview
 4
 Social media is also a big thing: Apart from linkedin, you can like every social media site of this company like Twitter, Facebook, and get information about every update related to it
 5
 Stay in touch with the company's HR department: You can get information about the company from the company's HR department
 khaas karke company ke prospectos ko bhi hasil kar sakate hai

 match phixing jaanch main 11 saal pehle jurmaana jhelane vaale pakistan ke purv test cricketer or ampire akram raja ko chah kathith sattebaajon ke saath giraftaar kiya gaya he, jo maujuuda ipel par satta khilaa rahe the
 "we arrested seven people from a plaza in the Liberty area of gulbarga and one of them was identified as Akram Raza, a former Pakistani player," said a senior police officer of Gulberg police station
 raja ne pakistan ke liye nau test or 49 vanade match khele hai or philhal vah pakistan ke pratham shrenee ampiron main shaamil hai
 The officer said that they had received information that a gang of bookies was betting on the IPL in Liberty area, after which the raid was conducted
 unhone kaha, hamen nakadi, mobail phone or bharat ke kai telephone number mili hai
 He said that the other arrested people, including Raza, have been kept at Gulberg station, but so far no charges have been made
 shuukravaar ko lalu yadav ke tamaam thikaanon par chhaapon kii khabar aayi to ye sawaal vaazib tha ki kya ab nitish or lalu ke bich hichkole lekar chal rahaa gathbandhan khatm hone kii kagaar par pahunch gaya he
 The question was also natural to arise because Tejashwi Yadav, who is a minister in Nitish's government, has come in the wraps of the CBI FIR
 kya sushasan babu kii image par fakr karne vaale nitishatejaswiko mantri mandal se baahar nikaalenge
 Everyone wanted to know the answer to this question but those who had the answer to this question were neither talking to anyone nor were available to answer the media's questions
 ye baat ittefaq ho sakati he ki shuukravaar kii subah jabalalu yadav ke thikaanon par chhapapada to nitish kumaar patna main nahin balki rajgir main the
 He had actually left for Rajgir on Thursday
 adhikarik taur par ye kaha ja rahaa he ki nitish kumaar kii tabiyat thik nahin thi or wo aaraam karne ke liye rajgir gaye hai
 But the speculation market is hot
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar ko pehle se hi lalu ke thikaanon par chaape ke bare main bataa diya gaya tha
 So that they can also be taken in confidence and if the law and order system deteriorates after raids, then the state government should be ready for it
 kuch logon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki vipaksh kii taraf se raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaar mira kumaar se aamanaa saamana nahin ho isliye nitish ne patna chhod diya tha
 Meira Kumar had gone to Patna on Thursday to meet legislators and seek support
 sutron ke mutabik mira kumaaranitishase bhi mulaakaat karnaa chaahati thim
 Nitish has already announced that his party will support NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind
 jediu lalu ke khilaaf chuppi ko bhi apana hathiyaar bana rahi he
 This thing was also visible in Delhi
 sharad yadav or har baat main party kaa paksh media main rakhane vaale kasee tyaagi donon dilli main hi the
 But despite all the efforts of journalists, these leaders were not ready to open their mouth on Lalu's question
 bahut kurdane par ye baat bhi pataa chali ki inhen party hai kaman kii taraf se is maamle par chup rahane ko kaha gaya he
 That means JDU is left alone in trouble
 sutron ke mutabik, jediu is liye chup he ki bolne kaa matlab hoga yaa tolalu yadavaka paksh lenaa yaa phir iske liye bijepi or centre sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehra kar yah aarope lagaana ki centre sarkaar sibiai kaa durupyog kar rahi he
 The JDU neither wants to implicate itself in the quagmire of Lalu's scandals at this time nor does it want to spoil relations with the BJP for Lalu
 nitish kumaar is maukey ko lalu or unke beton par dabaav banane ke liye bakhubi istemaal kar rahe hai
 It is a great opportunity for Nitish to strengthen his position in the coalition government
 iske liye jaruri he ki lalu or sibiai ke bich main bilkul nahin padana
 It is being said that even after the raids and the lawsuits, Nitish will not hurry to get Lalu's sons removed from the cabinet
 ve rajgir main baithkar hawa kaa ruukh dekh rahe hai
 Some people say that if Lalu and his son get caught in the scam and badly, both the RJD and the Congress may split
 patna main ye baat khub charchaa main he ki mira kumaar se milane ke liye congress or argedy ke vidhayakon kii jo baithak guuruuvaar ko bulaai gai thi usamen congress ke saat or argedy ke do darjan vidhayak nadaarad the
 jdu's national executive meeting is going to be held in Delhi on 23 July
 mana ja he ki tab tak chijen kaaphi kuch saaf ho jaaengi
 After electing the opposition in the presidential election, people are eyeing the vice-presidential election as to what Nitish feeds on

 jab ham kisi ke saath koi rishta shuru karte hai to ye sochakar aage badhate hai ki is rishte ko hamen jindagibhar nibhaana he
 You have to support your life, but sometimes something happens that only after some time, that relationship gets upset
 relationships main kuch bhi aisa nahin bachataa he jisaki vajah se aap us rishte ko aage badhaane kii sochen
 Then, at a point, you start thinking of separation
 agar aapke saath bhi kuch aisa hi hua he or aap apane relation ko khatm karne kii soch rahi hai to ho na ho uske peeche koi badi vajah to hogi hi
 This applies mainly to women because they do not add to break any relation
 wo ek baar jab kisi ke saath rishta jodatii hai to use ant tak nibhaane kii koshish karti hai
 But if a woman is taking the initiative and ending the relationship, then there will be a serious reason behind it
 haalanki apwaad har jagah hote hai or use andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa par phir bhi mahilaayein sambandhon ko lekarpurushon kii tulana main zyada samvedansheelhoti hai
 If you too want to take your relationship with someone up a notch, then think about it seriously first
 sochie, kii jis ladke ko aap apana jeevanasathi banane vaali hai wo jindagibhar aapkaa saath nibhaa paaegaa yaa nahin
 If you still do not find a solution, then consider his habits once and if these 5 habits are seen in your boyfriend, then it is better to move away from the relationship immediately
 1
 Does your boyfriend hide things from you? Does he lie to you about small things? If this is the case then it is better that you separate from him now
 2
 Does he always talk about being physical? If yes, then know that it is lust not love
 3
 Does your mood deteriorate when you tell her about a male friend? If yes, then know that both of you are in the relationship but there is neither trust nor understanding in your relationship
 4
 Is everything for him his feelings, his family, his work? Isn't he as sensitive to you as he is to himself? 5
 kya aap ab bhi use samajhane kii koshish kar rahi hai kyonki wo ghadi-ghadi badal jaataa he

 ' film kaa naam: tera sururdiarector: shaun aranhaster cast:himesh reshmia ,farah karimi, nasiruddin shah, shekhar kapur, kabir bedi, monica dogrivadhi:1 ghanta 46 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga: 2
 As soon as the name of 5 star Himesh Reshammiya starts to beat the music, a Kashish-filled voice knocks in front of you, which mesmerizes you while holding the mic in your hand
 himesh ek produsar, sangeetkaar or singer ke rup main pehle se hi kaaphi femes hai or actor ke rup main himesh ne 'aapkaa surur' 'karj' 'radio' or kuch saal pehle'the xpose'film kii thi jisane kaaphi kamai bhi kii thi
 Now Himesh is once again seen acting in the film 'tera Suroor', will 'tera Surroor' also be a successful film of his? Let's know how this film is: Story: The story of the film is of Raghu (himesh Reshammiya) and Tara (farah Karimi)
 raghu ek bada gangster he lekin uski jindagi main jab tara kii entry hoti he to uskaa ek imotional said bhi dikhaai dene lagata he
 For some reason, Tara moves to the city of Dublin where she is caught in connection with a case and Raghu goes to Dublin in search of her
 phir kai alag-alag ghatnaayen ghatati jaati hai, ab kya raghu or tara kii is kahani ko vaazib ant milegaa? kya raghu, tara kodeblinase waapas mumbai laa paaegaa? ye jaanane ke liye film dekhni padegi
 Script: The film is a thriller but not a suspense binder
 jis pal kaa aap aakhir tak intjaar karte hai, wo suspence aapako niraash karata he
 The film needed a better climax that it could not find
 kamaal kii cinemetography or umdaa gaanon ke hote hue bhi kahani feeki pad gai
 The stalwarts like Naseeruddin Shah, Shekhar Kapur, Kabir Bedi are in the film but they have not been used properly in the story
 maatr 106 minute kii film he, lekin interval ke baad aapke bheetar jo utsukata bani rahati he usko sahi anjaam nahin mil paata he
 Acting: The presence of ensemble cast Naseeruddin Shah, Shekhar Kapoor and Kabir Bedi in the film enhances this, as well as acting for the first time, Farah Karimi has done a good job
 vahiin, himesh reshmia ne kirdaar ke liye jo mehnat kii he wo parde par dikhaai bhi padati he
 Music: The songs of the film have already been a hit before release, 'main Wo Chand', 'bekudi' 'wafa Ne Infidelity' songs have been used well in the film
 becoground score bhi film ko kaaphi rochak banaata he

 Not only this, all the big officials are doing the investigation related to terrorism, in such a situation, how would any terrorist be benefited by killing Tanjil? However, until the police reach Munir, accused of killing Tanjil, the reason for his murder will remain secret

 police ko is qatl main tanzeel ke gaanv sahaspur ke hi teen logon zainul, reyaan or munir par shaq he
 All three were involved in that daily wedding
 police ke mutabik teenon tanzeel se nafrat karte the kyonki reyaan tanzeel ke rishtedaar hai jinke parivaar main sampatti ke bantwaare main tanzeel ne reyaan ke pita kaa virodh kiya tha
 Zainul is also angry with Tanjil for his behavior and has some property dispute with Munir
 teenon vahaan se do bike se nikle
 Zainul took off from Ryan's bike, while Munir gave his helmet and bike to Ryan
 munir munh pe kapadaa baandh kar khud reyaan ke saath peeche baitha
 He roasted Tanjil with bullets
 tippaniyan The NIA, ATS, STF and the biggest police officers are investigating the case
 inase poochtacha main bhi yah log shaamil hai
 Investigation agencies suspect that the reason for this may not be the love triangle
 aisa bhi shaq zaahir kiya gaya he ki tanzeel or munir ek hi ladki se prem karte the
 But in respect of the dignity of an NIA officer, the investigating agencies consider it appropriate to remain silent on this issue
 lekin tanzeel ke bhai raagaib kaa kahana he ki tanzeel kii hatya aatankwaadiyon ne kii he

 lekin jaanch agenciyon kaa tark he ki agar yah aatankwaadiyon kaa kaam hota to wo dilli main maarthe
 Killing an NIA officer in Delhi would have caused many times more terror
 agar aatankwaadi hote to car main baithe puure parivaar ko maar dete, sirf tanzeel ko chun kar nahin
 Then the terrorists do not attack any village in the night at one o'clock
 yahi nahin, aatankwaad se judi jaanch ke tamaam bade adhikari kar rahe hai, aise main tanzeel ko maarane se kisi aatankwaadi ko kya phayda hoga? baharhaal jab tak police tanzeel ke qatl ke aaropee munir tak nahin pahunch jaati he tab tak unke qatl kii vajah raaj hi rahegi

 'lady Singham' first punches a boy's head
 usee haath se jis haath main mobile dabaae hai
 The boy's mother was standing nearby
 maa ko bete kii pitayee bardaasht nahin hoti
 So, she asks the City SP all the time that why her son is killing him, suddenly the City SP loses his temper
 iske baad wo bete ke saamne uski maa ko thappad jad detii hai
 The mother is so angry with this slap that she forgets that the slap was killed by SP City

 It took a long time for Kumaraswamy's coronation in Bengaluru to understand that wars are fought against direct enemies, politics is, in fact, the art of targeting someone and tackling someone
 karnataka tak desh kii siyasat isi kala kaa anokhaa vistaar thi
 So it took time to clear who was in danger and who was being intimidated? The fog of strategy is now beginning to fade
 paale khinch rahe hai
 The bugle of the real battle of Indian politics is played in Bangalore
 shah-modi kii fouj pichley chaar saal se congress mukt bharat banane kii muhim main mubtila he maano mari or ladend congress kabhi bhi dragon kii tarah jag uthegi or bhaajapa kii bhimkaay chunavi fouj ko palak jhapakate nigal jaaegi
 However, after 2014, the BJP itself glorified the representativeness of the Congress, otherwise the voters would have included this elderly party in Jan 10, Janpath
 netaa or ranneeti, donon main bauni ho chuki congress, bhaajapa ke chunavi or rajnatik lakshyon main baadha nahin balki suvidha he
 It is the Congress that can play the role of a fantasy enemy in a two-party fictional bjp-ruled democracy with presidential methodologies
 bhaajapa ko khatra to asankhya kshetreey takaton va pahachaanon se he, congress kii oot main jinhen sametane kii koshish chal rahi thi
 This maneuver has now become visible
 shatrutaon kaa adhyayan, vyaktigat or samuhik shastreey manovigyaan kaa priy shagal he
 a bomb or gun has to be conceptualized before an enemy dies from it
 yah avadharana aajkal prerak manovigyaan kaa hissaa bhi he
 That is, the imagination of a force which is always engaged in a conspiracy against us and which is constantly needed to succeed
 bhaajapa ne satta main aane ke baad do kaalpanik shatru gadhe—ek tha vampanth jo pehle hi dhundho to jane kii sthiti main pahunch chukaa tha or doosraa tha congress mukt bharat
 By the way, there was no need to take the initiative to free India from the Congress because the Congress itself had done it to a large extent
 2004 ke aam chunaav ke baad se 2014 tak congress ne kareeb 60 chunaav haare (congress mukt bharat ne 2009 ke baad tej raftaar se) or 29 chunaav jite
 The 2009 Lok Sabha victory and the 2014 grand defeat are among these
 haar ke aankadon main kai bade rajya (uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, gujarat, madhya pradesh, odisha) bhi hai, jahaan kii nai peedi ko google se poochna hoga ki aakhri baar congress ne vahaan kab raaj kiya tha
 The Congress that the BJP had got after 2014, it was also properly relieved of the burden of being the opposition
 dushmano kaa khauf, senaaon ke prerak manovigyaan kaa hissaa hota he phir chaahe vah jang chunavi hi kyon na ho
 However, in making the Congress a bigger rival than it was, it was not just the bjp's aim that its army should always play the drums of war against the Congress, but a bigger purpose is to intimidate or shrink the regional parties which are its real enemies
 And the direct attack on which is not suitable for future needs (alliance)
 akhil bhartiya bhaajapa banaam kshetreey dalon kaa yah muqabla, akhil bhartiya congress banaam kshetreey dal jaisaa haragij nahin he
 The biggest breaker in the monolithic political nationalism that the BJP is engaged in is 'regionalism', which is alive on the politics of sub-nationalist identities
 bhaajapa ke saanskrithik dharmik rashtrawaad main bhi yahi dal kanta hai jo jaateey asmitaaon ko chamakaakar har chunaav ko hindu banaam hindu bana dete hai
 Keep in mind that BJP is not stopped by the Congress in Karnataka but by the Janata Dal (S)
 bihar main lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar, bengal main mamata banerjee, odisha main naveen patnayak uski raah main khadey ho gaye
 The Pitti Congress in Karnataka will now have to become the BJP of 1995-96 before becoming the Congress of 2009
 jab bhaajapa kshetreey pahachaanon kii chaaya main gaiyr congresavad kaa formula singha rahi thi
 The satraps of the regional parties will have to meet the sunlight and dust of the road because the goal of Congress-free India campaign is not Rahul Gandhi but all those regional parties whose leaders came to Bangalore to place the crown on Kumaraswamy's head

 'dedh ishkia' nishchit taur par maadhuri kii badi chalaang he
 Madhuri says, "this is a good time for women to be in the industry at this time
 jab unhone mujhe patakatha sunai, main bahut utsuk thi
 This is the role that appealed to me
 " He told "begum Para is a beautiful character written by Abhishek

 On reaching Srinagar from Delhi, Geelani's rally was attended by separatist Muslims
 is dauraan bheed ne pakistan ke paksh main naare lagaae or paak kaa jhanda bhi buland kiya
 But in the face of separatist politics, the administrative system of the Mufti government remained a silent spectator

 The reason for so much hatred for the villagers in the heart of Kannu is the panchayat elections in Karvedi village of Sonepat

 Whatever election has been held in Bihar in the last 18 years, RJD has been majorly involved in it
 janata dal parivaar se nikalakar bani rashtriya janata dal samaajawaadee vichaardhaara par chalane kaa daawa karti he lekin ise lalu yadav kii party ke taur par hi dekha jaataa he
 There have also been allegations of dynasticism
 bihar chunaav main is baar argedy janata parivaar kii hi puraani party jediu or congress ke saath milakar endie ko chunauti de rahi he
 Let's take a look at the important milestones of rjd's political journey
 1
 Lalu Yadav formed his own party as RJD in 1997 when he was having a difficult time in the Janata Dal
 chaara ghotaalaa maamle main aaropon se ghirne ke baad lalu yadav ke liye janata dal adhyaksh pad par bane rahanaa mushkil ho gaya
 Sharad Yadav got the post of President of Janata Dal
 iske baad 5 july 1997 ko lalu prasad apane vishwaasapaatr netaaon ko lekarajanata dal se alag ho gaeor yaheen se neenv padi rashtriya janata dal kii yani argedy kii
 2
 raghuvansh prasad singh, kanti singh samet loksabhaa ke 17 saansad or rajyasabha ke 8 saansad lalu prasad kii party main aa gaye
 Lalu Prasad Yadav's supporters gathered in New Delhi and Rashtriya Janata Dal was formed and Lalu Yadav was made its president
 is party colaalaten chunaav chihn aavantit huaor lalu yadav ne daawa kiya ki yelaalaten garib kii kutiyaa main raushnee laaegaor samaajwaad kaa naaraa buland karegaa
 3
 1999 ke shuruyaat main lalu yadav ko chaara ghotaale main jail janaa padaa or bihar main sarkaar kii kamanalalu yadav ne apni patni rabari devi ko saunp di
 In the general elections held in March 1998, RJD won 17 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar
 iske baad argedy ne mulaayam singh yadav kii party ke saath bhaajapa ke khilaaf gathbandhan banaaya lekin ye koshish bhi koi khaas asar nahin dikhaa saki
 4
 oktober 1999 memloksabhaa ke phir se chunaav hue
 RJD contested with Congress but could win only 10 seats
 5
 However, in the 2000 Bihar assembly elections, the party came to power by securing majority
 rabari devi ne phir se bihar kii satta sanbhali
 After coming out of jail, Lalu Yadav turned to the power of the Center
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main argedy upie gathbandhan kaa hissaa banakar chunavi maidan main utari or 21 siton par jeet hasil kii
 Lalu Yadav joined the Central Government and took charge of the Railway Ministry
 6
 However, when the Bihar assembly elections were held in 2005, the equation changed drastically
 bhaajapa ne endie gathbandhan banaaya or nitish kumaar ko bihar main endie ke chehre ke taur par pesh kiya
 Lalu Yadav's party could manage only 75 seats
 haalanki, koi bhi dal sarkaar nahin bana sakaa
 Elections were held the same year and the RJD was reduced to 21 seats
 endie gathbandhan ko bahumat mila or nitish kumaar mukhyamantri bane
 7
 bihar ke alaava jharkhand or purvottar ke rajyon main upasthiti darj karaane vaali argedy ko 2008 main rashtriya party kaa darja hasil hua
 8
 2009 ke aam chunaavon main congress ke saath siton kaa bantwaaraa nahin ho sakaa or argedy upie se baahar aa gai
 Alliances with Ram Vilas Paswan and Samajwadi Party
 is chunaav main argedy kaa pradarshan bahut hi kharaab rahaa
 Only 4 mps of the party could reach the Lok Sabha
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main party ne samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan tod liya
 On 30 July 2010, Rashtriya Janata Dal's national party status was withdrawn
 9
 The RJD then contested with the UPA in the 2014 general elections
 haalanki, narendra modi kii aguwai main utari bhaajapa kii aandhi ko rokane main upie gathbandhan puri tarah vifal rahaa
 Lalu Yadav could not contest the elections due to the Supreme Court order
 unki patni rabari devi or beti misa bharti chunaav haar gaye
 The NDA alliance won a historic victory
 jahaan, congress party keval 44 siton par simat kar rah gai vahiin argedy ke keval 4 saansad loksabhaa pahunch sake
 10
 loksabhaa chunaavon main mili haar or bhaajapa ke udai ne janata dal parivaar ke dalon ko ekajute kiya or 14 april 2015 ko argedy, jediu, jedy-es, samaajawaadee party, indian neshnal lokdal or samaajawaadee janata party ne elaan kiya ki sabhi dalon kaa vilay karajanata parivaar ko ek kiya jayega
 Several rounds of talks took place and Mulayam Singh Yadav was also declared the head of the proposed new party
 lalu prasad yadav ne samvaadadaata sammelan kar argedy ke vilay kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di
 But as the Bihar elections drew near, the dream of the merger of the Janata family also fell into disarray
 ekajutata kii is koshish ke vifal ho jane ke baad phir daawa kiya gaya ki sabhi dal milakar chunaav ladenge
 But Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party broke away after the RJD-JDU and Congress declared fewer seats
 janata parivaar ko ek karne kaa sapana bhi raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon main phir se kho gaya
 In Bihar assembly elections, Lalu Yadav's RJD has contested 101 seats while JDU 101 and Congress in 41 seats

 After this, his chances of getting out of jail have increased
 isse pehle islamabad hai court ne jan suraksha aadesh ke tahat use hiraasat main rakhane vaali adhisuchana ko nilambit kar diya he
 The notification was released after he was granted bail by a court in the 26 / 11 assault case
 adhisuchana nilamban ke ye aadesh justise nur ul haq kuraishi ne jari kiye
 The judge of the anti-terrorism Court in Islamabad granted him bail on December 18, citing lack of evidence against Lakhvi in the Mumbai attack case
 isse pehle lakhvi jail se reeha ho paata, sarkaar ne use lok vyavastha banaae rakhane se jude kanoon (empio) ke tahat teen maheene ke liye hiraasat main le liya tha

 The big question is that if the Congress had joined the coalition, the results would have changed

 The Congress could not even manage to cut votes by law
 sirf 8 aisi siten thim jahaan congress or mahagathbandhan ko mili voton kaa yoga endie se zyada tha
 On this basis, it can be said that even if everyone got together, the NDA would have got at least 56 seats
 haalanki ye ek abhaasi sthiti he

 That is, there was a huge lack of 'synergy' between the voters of both parties

 haalanki yah saaf taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki gaiyr jatav voton ko bijepi ne apni taraf khinchakar pasa palat diya
 Axis My India believes that non-jatav Dalits preferred the BJP because of the central schemes run for the poor (free cylinder gas, toilets, free houses)

 His lawyers, including Pareek and Bar Association President Gopesh Kumbhaj, had a lot of debate with the judge

 The deadlock did not break in many meetings between representatives of the High Court administration and lawyers
 kumbhaj kehete hai ki prashasan donon jajon ke tabadale ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 In the meantime, there was criticism for making a private eviction case a strike issue, when lawyers changed tactics and raised a corruption case in the administration

 Pareek says, "we are fed up with this

 However, in the ongoing negotiations to end the strike, the issue of corruption is getting worse, raising doubts as to whether the lawyers are serious about ending the strike

 He used to suggest the name of MGR in his films

 lekin yah dosti bahut lambii nahin chali
 When Karunanidhi became the Chief Minister, MGR asked him to make me Health Minister, Karunanidhi refused
 kaha ki pehle acting chodo phir mantri bano
 There are different opinions on why MGR split from Karunanidhi but it is also a great turn of history that MGR parted ways with them to form AIDMK and become their rivals

 How the people of Tamil Nadu who were competing politically behind these two leaders must be feeling today, it is difficult to tell from a distance here

 Became Chief Minister for the first time on 10 February 1969
 2003 se 2008 tak mukhyamantri rahe
 We have been seeing the face of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi from above, but on the state land, both the parties must have had an army of brilliant workers and local leaders who have been the pillars of politics of both
 jayalalita pash garden main rahati thim to karunanidhi gopalpuram main
 Once the Congress sacked his government, but Karunanidhi joined the Congress and formed the government and got the MGR government sacked

 Annadurai gave him the title of Mr
 Eleven Lakhs at a rally
 tamilnadu ke mahaan samaaj sudhaarak periyar ke kehane par unhone kudiyarasu patrika kaa sampadan chhod diya
 Karunanidhi later separated from Periyar and joined Anna
 unhone kai filmon kii script likhi he
 Karunanidhi and MGR became friends, in connection with the same film
 em ji aar gandhi ko maanane vaale the to ve karunanidhi ko gandhi par likhi kitaaben diya karte the or karunanidhi em ji aar ko anna durai kii likhi kitaaben diya karte the
 Karunanidhi earned a name as a script writer
 ve apni likhi filmon main em ji aar kaa naam sujhaate the
 MGR became a star overnight
 karunanidhi film likh rahe the or em ji aar super star ban rahe the
 One result of this friendship was that MGR left the Congress Party and joined the DMK in 1953
 anna durai or karunanidhi ne dekha ki em ji aar kii lokapriyata unke raajnneetik sandeshon ko failaane main khub kaam aa rahi he
 But this friendship did not last long
 karunanidhi jab mukhyamantri bane to em ji aar ne unase kaha ki mujhe swasthya mantri bana den, karunanidhi ne manaa kar diya
 Said to first stop acting and then become a minister
 is baat par alag-alag raay he ki em ji aar kyon karunanidhi se alag hue magar yah bhi itihaas kaa ek shandaar mode he ki em ji aar unase alag hokar eidiemke banaate hai or unke pratidwandi ban jate hai
 After that, the politics of the state and India becomes witness to the political competition of both for a long time
 pehle em ji aar kaa nidhan hua, uske lambey samay baad je jayalalita kaa or uske baad ab em karunanidhi
 The story is that even after the separation of MGR, Karunanidhi used to respect Karunanidhi so much that once the leader of his party did not name him with respect, he slapped and said that Karunanidhi is my leader
 main khud unhen kalanger kahata hum
 So this is the story which ended today
 tamilnadu ke log jo in do netaaon ke peeche raajnneetik pratispardhaa karte the, wo aaj kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe honge, yahaan dur se bataanaa mushkil he
 The farewells of the two greats of the politics of the South cannot be analyzed only by routine matters

 Jayalalitha lived in the loop garden while Karunanidhi lived in Gopalapuram
 ek baar congress ne inaki sarkaar barkhaast kar di magar karunanidhi ne congress se milakar sarkaar bana lee or em ji aar kii sarkaar barkhaast karvaa di
 Then he met the Congress and contested the assembly and lost
 iske baad bhi upie sarkaar main partner rahe
 The quality of these leaders is that they have won elections many times, lost many times
 inke bich khud ko kehane vaali neshnal party kabhi jagah nahin bana saki
 Vinod k Hoze, editor of Caravan magazine, wrote a daily article on Karunanidhi in April 2011, titled 'the Last Year'
 isamen is baat kaa zikr he ki 1957 or 62 main jab diemke haar gai tab annadurai ne sochaa ki bagaiyr paise ke sirf vichaardhaara se jeet nahin milegi
