 What is the point of joining that government which is heading towards the end? ”uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said something like smiling to India Today
 yah jawaab hamaare us sawaal par tha jisamen hamane unase poocha tha ki kya samaajawaadee party centre main congress ke netritv vaali sarkaar main shaamil hogi
 It was the evening of July 18, just hours before his father Mulayam Singh Yadav was seated at the table with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at a glittering lunch organized by the UPA before the presidential election
 jo log yah samaj rahe the ki yah lunch sarkaar main hissedari kii bhoomika thi, unke liye yah bayaan niraash kar dene vaala tha
 This also indicated that the political group knows: Mulayam has trump aces and will follow him on every occasion
 akhilesh kii tippanee us baangi kaa hissaa he jo is saal march se hi dekhi ja rahi he
 Addressing party workers on March 18, shortly after SP came to power in Uttar Pradesh after five years, Mulayam Singh Yadav presented his assessment: "nothing can be said that the general election (which is to be held in 2014) When should it be
 yah ab kisi bhi din ho sakate hai
 He repeated this idea after five days while addressing a function in Lucknow
 iske baad phir 11 june ko rajdhani main apni party ke kendriya sansadeey board ko sambodhit karte hue unhone saansadon se kaha ki ve khub mehnat karen or jaldi chunaavon ke liye taiyaar rahen
 a month later, on July 10, Mulayam Singh once again created a stir in the political section by expressing the possibility of elections
 lakhanu ke 19, vikramaditya maarg par sthit party karyaalay main sapa kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha, ''hamen chunaavon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 This can happen prematurely and possibly next year
 isliye yah mahatvapurn he ki party ke netaa gambhirtha se kaam karen or apane-apane kshetra kaa daura karen
 a few minutes later, on the same stage, his cousin Ram Gopal Yadav created an atmosphere of warmth when he announced the names of observers for all 58 Lok Sabha constituencies where the SP candidates lost in the 2009 elections
 is par akhilesh ne safai di, ''loksabhaa chunaav kisi bhi tarah se 2014 kii shuruyaat main hone hi hai
 Therefore, if we are asking our people to be ready by 2013, then there is no warning in this
 aakhir maine bhi to apni rathyatra uttar pradesh main chunaavon se saat maheene pehle shuru kii thi
 “mulayam has become accustomed to playing UPA or playing UPA to beat UPA
 unka anumaanit ganit jamini vaastaviktaa ke kathor vishleshan par aadhaarit he
 They understand that it will hardly be possible to go above the height of the victory in the assembly elections in March and if they have to win more seats in the next Lok Sabha election, they cannot wait long
 march, 2013 main chunaav hone se unhen adhiktam siten mil sakati hai, jabaki 2014 main chunaav hone se vah apana pradarshan shaayad hi itnaa behatar par paaenge
 But if Mulayam wants to force the government by toppling the government, he will have to do something soon
 aisa kuch monsoon satr ke dauraan ho saktaa he jo 8 agast se shuru ho rahaa he
 The month of August is going to be exceptionally turbulent for the Congress due to various reasons, from the growing crisis of influence to the ambitions of the allies
 trinmul congress kii netaa mamata banerjee kii soch bhi mulaayam singh kii hi tarah he
 NCP leader Sharad Pawar has also threatened to resign after the Prime Minister is not given the number-2 position in the UPA cabinet
 chunavi bisatsai kahani kii talashis tufaan kii disha udhar hi hogi jidhar mulaayam ise le jaaenge
 He has the balance of the Lok Sabha, not only on the numbers but also on the speed of his swing
 mulaayam ne apni ichha jataa di he, lekin unhone yah saaf nahin kiya he ki is uddeshy ko paane ke liye unki yojana kya he
 This game is also risky
 jab aap jald chunaav ke liye majaboor karte hai to aapke paas iske liye aisi ek kahani honi chahie jisase janata ko santusht kiya ja sake
 The government is feeling some relief from the fact that the path to destabilize the government is hazy and can be easily dealt with
 khud congress kaa sarkaron ko asthir karne kaa pichhlaa record aisa sabak he jise netaa bhoolanaa nahin chaahate
 The Congress has toppled four governments at the Center, but has benefited from only one such exercise
 indira gandhi ne 1979 main charan singh kii sarkaar ko giraane kaa khel rachaa tha, rajeev gandhi ne 1991 main chandrashekhar sarkaar kii patari ukhaad di, seetaram kesari ne 1997 main ech
 D
 devgauda or 1998 main indra kumaar gujral sarkaar ko dubo diya
 But only Indira Gandhi was able to take advantage of this game because she had planned very carefully what she had to do next
 mulaayam jaanate hai ki loksabhaa main sirf 21 saansadon ke dam par ve jaldi chunaav karaane kaa maahaul nahin bana sakate
 For this, they have to form an anti-congress alliance within the UPA
 kya unhen iske liye sahyogi dalon yaa unke ek gut kaa samarthan milegaa? upie ko loksabhaa main 272 saansadon kaa samarthan hasil he jo 543 sadasyon vaali loksabhaa main bamushkil aadhe ke paar he
 These include 19 members of TMC
 bahujan samaaj party (20 saansad) or rashtriya janata dal (4 saansad) baahar se samarthan de rahe hai
 The story of toppling the government cannot be made on the basis of just the reasons beneficial to the party
 janata ko yah baat samjaani hogi ki sarkaar ne apana sarokaar kho diya he
 The best argument Mulayam Singh can give is that farmers are becoming financially distressed

 Economist and former Union Minister Yogendra K
 alagh kaa maananaa he ki kharif kii fasal ko to nuksaan ho hi gaya he
 He said, "due to lack of rain in the first week of June and July, sowing has been very low
 shuruaati barish kam hone se paidaavaar bhi kam hoti he
 "thus a weak monsoon can have a serious impact on agricultural yields
 haalanki, iskaa jidipi par asar kam hi hoga kyonki krishi kshetra kaa jidipi main yogadan sirf 14 fisadi he
 But it will have a huge impact on the people as agriculture accounts for 52% of the total labor force of the country
 alagh kehete hai, ''rojgaar main kami aegi, peyajal kii gambhir samasya paidaa hogi or log manaregaa par zyada nirbhar ho jaaenge

 On the one hand, the government is facing heavy criticism from Indian industry and foreign leaders for policy paralysis - US President Barack Obama and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Sien Leung have been vocal in the matter in recent weeks
 iskaa jawaab dena hoga
 Therefore, there is a renewed activism about FDI
 pichhali baar jab november, 2011 main sarkaar ne khudara kaarobaar main epadi ko kholane kii koshish kii thi to use upie main vidroh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The Congress feels that the situation is different now
 lekin vah galat ho sakati he
 On July 18, Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma told a business newspaper that there was little possibility of opposition to FDI in retail business from states other than West Bengal
 usee din akhilesh ne ek akhbaar se kaha ki retail kaarobaar main epadi aam aadmi ke khilaaf he
 If the government goes ahead with the FDI agenda, then a confrontation with Mulayam and Mamta is inevitable

 The challenges of floor management have increased in the House before the Congress as Pranab Mukherjee is now heading towards Rashtrapati Bhavan
 shaayad congress ke liye sabase kathin taatkaalik nirnay loksabhaa ke netaa kaa naam tay karne kaa hoga
 The only stature and influence that Mukherjee had was that he saw four senior BJP leaders - Murali Manohar Joshi, Rajnath Singh, Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh - sitting in the Lok Sabha on March 15 slapping them on "behavior like irritable children"
 Get or kisi ke paas vah kad nahin he jo kisi ko is tarah se daant-fatkaar sake
 So it is not surprising that after this scolding, Sonia said in Mukherjee's ear, "so, we need you
" ''shikhar kaa shoonyaparty behaal, yuvaraj nadaardamulaayam singh, mamata banerjee or gathbandhan ke anya sahyogi agar upie sarkaar kii nakel kasne main ab zyada majboot sthiti main hai to sirf isliye ki congress kaa netritv kamjor he
 Five years ago, no one had made a mistake during the presidential election

 The situation in the Congress has become such that even ordinary incidents are taking the shape of crisis
 aise halaat main congress kii ranneeti yah hoti he ki is baat kaa prachaar kar diya jaae ki ek or sankat tal gaya or ab sab kuch thik he
 On July 18, just a day before voting for the presidential election, Sonia hosted a dinner for the UPA and its allies at the Ashok Hotel in Delhi

 When there is silence, the Congress builds theory on what is heard
 masalan, ek cabinet mantri ne bataaya, ''maine jo suna he, uske mutabik rahul ne maa se kaha he ki ve tabhi pradhanmantri banenge jab congress purna bahumat main aegi
 Well, this is not going to happen for a long time
 ''vikalpon kii kami ke chalate congressi ab rahul par dabaav daalane lage hai ki ve apni aaramgaah se baahar aaen or zyada mahati jimmedaari kandhon par lekar apni mehmaan kii bhoomika ko khatm karen
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh has told the media that by September, Rahul will start to carry out some big responsibilities within the party organization
 is bayaan ke baad congressi yah kayaas lagane lage ki rahul ko yaa to party kaa upaadhyaksh yaa phir kaaryakari adhyaksh bana diya jayega, jise saaf karne ke liye digvijay ne india today ko bataaya ki unhen apane netaa kii yojanaon ke bare main kuch pataa nahin he, ve to bas party kii unase apekshaaon ko aawaaj de rahe the
 Digvijay said, "people are really expecting this
" sitambar maine isliye kaha kyonki tab tak raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ke chunaav khatm ho chuke honge
 This will be the right time
 ''baharhaal, 18 july ko jab sonia gandhi uparashtrapati hamid ansaari ko parchaa bharwane le ja rahi thim, to sansad ke baahar unhone ek hi bayaan dekar sari atakalon par viraam laga diya, ''rahul kii ore se koi nahin bol saktaa
 The very next day, in Parliament, Rahul told reporters that he was ready to play a bigger role in the party and the government, adding that the final decision on his role was to be taken only by the Congress President

 This was the time when Anna Hazare had almost taken the Parliament hostage by fasting at Ramlila Maidan and raised the demand of the government to pass the Jan Lokpal bill

 The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Jharkhand challenged the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) to withdraw support from the bjp-led Arjun Munda government in the state
 bhaajapa ne yah chunauti tab di, jab paanch din purv khudara kaarobaar main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) ke mudde par jhamumo ke saansadon ne sarkaar ke paksh main matdaan kiya
 There is resentment about this in the BJP camp
 party kii jharkhand ikai ke prabharee harendra pratap ne sawaal kiya, "jhamumo ko rajbhavan janaa chahie
 Why should we let our government fall? ”he said that the BJP did not want President's rule in the state
 jawaab main, jhamumo vidhayak lobin hembram ne kaha, "bhaajapa satta kii bhukhi he
 We challenge the BJP to take the same stand as it did in April 2010
 " Significantly, JMM MP Kameshwar Baitha had voted in favor of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in the Lok Sabha on FDI, while MP Shibu Soren of the same party abstained from voting
 isi tarah saat disambar ko epadiai mudde par jhamumo ke sadasyon ne rajyasabha main hue matdaan main bhaag na lekar paroksh rup se samprag sarkaar kii madad kii thi
 In April 2010, Shibu Soren voted in favor of the UPA government over the proposal brought by the BJP on the price hike, triggering angry withdrawal of support from the JMM government
 tippaniyan Deputy Chief Minister and JMM leader Hemant Soren told reporters on Sunday, "it is for the BJP to decide whether we should stay in the Jharkhand government or not
" epadiai par hamaara jo rukh tha, hamane apanaaya
 " ullekhneey he ki jharkhand main bhaajapa sitambar 2010 main jhamumo ke samarthan se satta main ai thi
 The BJP challenged this when JMM mps voted in favor of the government on the issue of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail business five days ago
 bhaajapa kheme main isi baat ko lekar naaraazgi he
 Harendra Pratap, in-charge of the party's Jharkhand unit, questioned, "JMM should go to Raj Bhavan
 ham apni sarkaar ko kyon girane den?" unhone kaha ki bhaajapa nahin chaahati ki rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu ho
 In response, JMM legislator Lobin Hembram said, "BJP is hungry for power
 ham bhaajapa ko chunauti dete hai ki usne april 2010 main jaisaa kiya, vaisaa hi rukh apanaae
 " gauratlab he ki jhamumo saansad kameshwar baitha ne epadiai par loksabhaa main congress ke netritv vaali sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ke paksh main matdaan kiya tha jabaki usee party ke saansad shibu sorain ne matdaan se khud ko alag rakhaa
 Similarly, on December 7, JMM members indirectly helped the UPA government by not participating in the voting in the Rajya Sabha
 april 2010 main moolyavriddhi par bhaajapa dwaara laae gaye prastaav par shibu sorain ne samprag sarkaar ke paksh main matdaan kiya tha, jisase naaraaz hokar bhaajapa ne jhamumo sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 The comments upmukhyamantri or jhamumo netaa hemanth sorain ne ravivaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha tha, "yah bhaajapa ko tay karnaa he ki hamen jharkhand sarkaar main rahanaa he yaa nahin
 We adopted our stand on FDI
 " It is noteworthy that BJP came to power in Jharkhand in September 2010 with the support of JMM
 party kii jharkhand ikai ke prabharee harendra pratap ne sawaal kiya, "jhamumo ko rajbhavan janaa chahie
 Why should we let our government fall? ”he said that the BJP did not want President's rule in the state

 lekin modi-shah kii jodi ne aisi chaal chali ki donon chaaron khaane chit ho gaye
 During the Lok Sabha elections it was said that there is a wave of Modi across the country
 lekin jab nattejey aae to pataa chalaa ki lahar nahin tsunami chal rahi thi
 In this tsunami, the caste equation of aunt and nephew got swept away

 At the same time, the Modi government also gave benefits of schemes like Jan Dhan, Kisan Pension Scheme and Mudra to all sections

 pita ke prabhaav kii vajah se ve 25 saal kii umr se hi himachal cricket control association (echpisie) kaa niyantran apane haathon main rakhte aae hai, teen baar saansad rahe hai, bisisiai main zyaadaatar samay satta paksh ke saath rahe hai, or echpisie ke prabhaavshaalee adhyaksh rahe hai, jinhone dharmashala jaise chote-se pahari shahar main cricket kaa antarrashtriya stadium banwaaya
 What most people do not know about him is a heavy blot on his CV
 2000 main, jab ve echpisie ke adhyaksh bane the to ranjai trophy ke ek match main hissaa lene ke liye ve bina kisi ko bataae subah-subah jammu pahunch gaye
 Upon reaching there, he told the team that he too would join the 11 players and play the match, although he was not selected in the team
 is baat par jab team ke captain rajeev nayyar ne virodh kiya to unhone unki baat darkinar kar di
 He was dismissed for zero in his only innings of the first class, but his objective was served
 unke khilne kii ek hi vajah thi or vah yah ki ve bhavishya main team ke chayankarta bananaa chaahate the—jiske liye ranjai kaa ek match khelnaa anivaary tha
 This is how Thakur's career as an administrator began with Apayash
 ek tarah se unhone usee ahankaar kii bhaavana kaa parichay diya, jo dashakon se bisisiai kii pahchaan bani hui he, or jisane lodha cameti kii report aane ke baad iske liye sankat khadaa kar diya
 According to this report, the BCCI needs a complete overhaul (changes in the selection process, qualification of officials, and professionalization of cricket in India)
 yah dekhte hue ki thakur pichley 16 saal main kitne dur aa chuke hai, 22 may ko bisisiai ke duusare sabase kam umr ke adhyaksh ke rup main unki niyukti (isse pehle 1963 main vadodara ke maharaja fatehsinghraav gaekwad kam umr main bisisiai ke adhyaksh bane the) yah bhi dikhaati he ki ve ab tak kitne badal chuke hai
 Many unfortunate events — Ann
 shrinivasana or 2013 main spot-phixing kaa maamla, 2015 main adhyaksh rahete hue jagmohan daalamia kaa nidhan, isisi kaa adhyaksh banane ke liye shashaank manohar kaa apane pad se istipha dena—ke daur ke baad aae 41 varshiya anuraag thakur bisisiai ke zyaadaatar purv adhyakshon se alag hai
 Politically, neither is his stature as big as former presidents Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sharad Pawar, nor does he have such a big influence that Dalmia, A
 si
 Industry personalities like Muthiah and Srinivasan were elevated to the post of president
 iske alaava thakur aise samay board kaa kaam sambhaal rahe hai jab vah 87 saal ke apane itihaas main sabase kathin daur se guzar rahaa he
 But unlike most other presidents (and despite the forced entry of Himachal's team), Thakur was considered a good cricket player during his school and college days
 1990 ke dashak ke shuru main jo log unke saath khel chuke the, ve unhen ek badhiya ballebaaj bataate hai, jinhone vibhinn pratiyogitaaon main punjab ke liye acha khel dikhaaya tha, or ve 1993 main bharat ai england or australia kii junior tiimon ke khilaaf bharat kii under-19 team ke liye khel sakate the
 There was also a time when he was very angry with the Punjab Cricket Association for not being selected in Ranji's team despite collecting many runs in local matches
 samay kaa pher dekhie—yah pisie ke sachiv em
 P
 pandov hi the, jinhone pichley hakrate mumbai main aam sadasyon kii ek vishesh baithak main bisisiai pramukh ke taur par unke naam kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 Thakur told India Today, "I am a cricketer-turned-administrator
 jab main chota tha to bharat ke liye cricket khilne kaa sapana dekhtaa tha, lekin ateet main kya hua, is bare main main ab nahin sochataa
 Now, as the President of BCCI, i have far greater responsibilities
 ''bisisiai main satta ke galiyaaron main unki kismat us samay chamakani shuru ho gai thi, jab centre main may, 2014 main narendra modi kii sarkaar bani thi
 Taking the help of his luck, he played the stakes of contesting for the post of Secretary of the Board in 2015
 shrinivasana kii ore se pehle tang karne or phir puchakaare jane ke baad thakur ne shrinivasana virdohi kheme kii taraf jane kaa faisla kiya or tatkaaleen sachiv sanjay patel ke khilaaf ek vot se vijayi rahe
 After reaching the second most important position on the board, Thakur started showing his influence due to Dalmiya's poor health
 unhone jald hi sikh liya ki kis tarah sankat ke samay prabandh sambhala jaataa he or kis tarah bisisiai jaise sampann or jatil sanghathan ko niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 He had initially formed a Cricket Advisory Committee, consisting of former junior teammates Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and V
V
 ve
 s Laxman joined and honored him when the Mudgal panel report came and Indian cricket was undergoing generational changes
 jab dil kaa daura padane se daalamia kaa nidhan ho gaya to board kaa kaarybhaar manohar ke upar aa gaya, kyonki thakur ko tab is kaam ke liye paryaapt rup se paripakv nahin mana ja rahaa tha
 But when Manohar decided to leave his post, the board decided to place a bet on Thakur instead of electing someone else in his era of increased accountability
 agle din dilli main janpath sthit unke nivas par khushiyaan manaai ja rahi thim, lekin thakur acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki unke upar baari jimmedaari aa gai he
 The BCCI has challenged many of the recommendations of the Lodha Committee in the court, but due to the expectation of the Supreme Court's decision in July, there is a problem at present
 darasal, yah anischitata hi mukhya vajah thi, jis vajah se manohar ke hatane ke baad board ke purv adhyakshon pavaar or shrinivasana ne apni daavedaari pesh nahin kii
 The responsibility of saving the BCCI is now on his shoulders
 ve kehete hai, ''bisisiai ke adhyaksh pad ke liye main apni bhoomika usee tarah dekhtaa hum jis tarah ballebaaji ke samay apni bhoomika dekhtaa tha
 i always played to win, not to run from a fight
 ''lekin jab unase aage aane vaali chunautiyon ke bare main poocha gaya to thakur ne sidhaa jawaab dene kii jagah krij ko chhodana hi uchit samajha
 He said, "we are not at all afraid of the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 main ise chunauti ke rup main nahin letaa
 i am an optimistic person
 lodha samiti kii zyaadaatar siforishein lagu karne yogya nahin hai, to unke bare main kyon chintaa karen
 i am sure that the Supreme Court would like to save the game in India, and in BCCI we have started the work of cleaning the system ourselves
 main maanata hum ki 2013 main hamane gadbaditaan kin, lekin ikkaa-dukka ghatnaayen bisisiai ke varshon ke achche kaam ko kharaab nahin kar saktin
 "old people of BCCI, some of whom have held positions at the state level for decades (it will end now if the Lodha Committee recommendations are accepted), hope that Thakur's association with the BJP proves to be a boon for the board
" It is possible
 haalanki bijepi ke kuch yuva chehron main se ek thakur vitt mantri arun jetali ke kareebi hai, jinhen nehru-gandhi parivaar ke khilaaf aag ugalane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In BCCI, Congress leaders like Rajiv Shukla and Jyotiraditya Scindia are also seen supporting them - at least for now
 board ke ek upaadhyaksh kehete hai, ''kisi ne andaja nahin lagaaya tha ki ve itani jaldi or itani kam umr main board ke adhyaksh ban jaaenge
 Due to the recommendations of the Lodha Committee, everyone seems to be organized at the moment but both he and new secretary Ajay Shirke will undergo a real test in the next six months
 ''kuch log aise bhi hai jinhen thakur se badi ummiden he
 Former India player Nikhil Chopra, who has played junior cricket with Thakur, believes he can fill the gap between domestic and international cricket
 ve kehete hai, ''junior str par ve bahut achche khilaadi the or ve khel ke vibhinn staron ke bich ke antar ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 They can understand the needs and demands of marginalized players
 ''bharat ke purv captain or bengal cricket sangh ke pramukh saurav ganguli maanate hai ki maujuuda paristhitiyon main anuraag thakur sabase acha vikalp hai
 They say, "have they not shown the right intention? i have been involved in many meetings with him
 ve khel ko lekar bahut gambhir hai
 This means a lot to me
 ''haalanki cricket kaa glamer or raajnneeti netaaon ko ek mouj kii jindagi dilaati he, lekin thakur ko dilli ke himachal bhawan se bas pakadakar apane nirvachan kshetra hamirpur tak 10 ghante kaa safar karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 His tenure as head of the board may have been a complete success for Indian cricket, but a complete failure as well - just like he got inadequate in the first match of Ranji or his glorious rise in the game, in which he sometimes Were unsuccessful in creating recognition
 loksabhaa upachunaav kii tarj par ek baar phir samaajawaadee party ne uttar pradesh main nayaa mahagathbandhan taiyaar kiya he or 2 siton ke liye hone vaale is vidhansabha upachunaav ke liye is gathbandhan main areldi uski nai saathi hogi
 To defeat the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, the Samajwadi Party has tied up with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) for the by-elections in 2 seats
 is qaraar ke tahat kairana seat se areldi chunaav ladegi or yah seat samaajawaadee party nearaldike liye chodi he, jahaan se samaajawaadee party kii pratyaashee raheen tabassum hasan ab areldi ke chunaav chinh par chunaav ladengi jabakinurpuramein samaajawaadee party kaa ummidavaar maidan main hoga
 The beginning of a new friendship was sealed after talks between the two party chiefs Akhilesh Yadav and Ajit Singh on Saturday evening, which is seen as the beginning of new friendship between Muslims and Jats
 samaajawaadee partimen pehle hi elaan kar rakhaa tha ki vah kisi surat main kairana seat nahin chhodeygi, lekin shuukravaar ko pehle daur kii baatcheet main jayant choudhary or akhilesh yadav ke bich ek-ek seat ke bantwaare ko lekar sahmati ban chuki thi
 Akhilesh Yadav had promised to give the Nurpur seat to the RLD, but when Ajit Singh finally demanded this seat on Saturday, Akhilesh asked him to leave the seat on the condition that the candidate was Tabassum Hasan whom Ajit Singh agreed and now Tabassum Hasan will contest for RLD from Kairana
 congress kaa bhi samarthan!samaajawaadee party ne nurpur ke liye naimul hasan ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he jo nurpur vidhansabha upachunaav main party ke pratyaashee honge
 If sources are to be believed, now the Congress party will also give its consent in the name of RLD as the Congress has earlier announced to support RLD, in such a situation, there will be a wide opposition unity in Kairana by-elections like Gorakhpur and Phulpur where against BJP Only one common candidate will contest
 mayawati kii mook sahmatibahujan samaaj party (bispi) haalanki aupchaarik taur par kisi ko bhi samarthan nahin dene kaa elaan kar chuki hai, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki sapa or areldi ke is gathbandhan ko antim taur par mayawati ne bhi apni maun sahmati de di he or tabhi ajit singh ke liye akhilesh yadav ne yah seat chodi
 Let me tell you that Mayawati was very angry with the cross-voting of RLD MLA Sahendra Singh in Rajya Sabha elections and she expressed her displeasure, later RLD removed her MLA from the party which has recently joined BJP

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, while referring to the decision of the people in the final decision in democracy, said that her party Trinamool Congress will win the next year's assembly elections due to the development work done in the last four years
 mamata ne twit kiya, 'loktantr main aakhri faisla logon kaa hota he
 Our records on development assure that we will win again in 2016
 ' When asked about Mamta's tweet, state finance minister Amit Mitra said, "it is better to ask him about the tweet
 lekin unhone kaha ki log aakhri faisla karenge
 He said this because there have been developments such as increase in plan expenditure and capital expenditure, improvement in physical and social structure

 After a nationwide protest against Anna Hazare's arrest, the government succumbed and released Anna
 lekin anna hajaare ne tihaad se baahar aane ke liye sarkaar ke saamne kuch sharten rakhi hai
 Anna Hazare has been released after getting a release warrant and is sitting in the prison dg's office

 gujarat parivartan party ke adhyaksh keshubhai patelne kaha ki mukhyamantri narendra modi rajya main vikaas ko lekar juthi baaten failaa rahe hai
 Addressing a huge gathering at the conclusion of his month-long 'parivartan Sandesh Yatra', Keshubhai said here, "modi will win if more and more lies are organized
 ’ unhone narmada nahar pariyojna ko samay par puraa nahin karne ke liye bhi modi nit bhaajapa sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said that if the project had been completed, the farmers would have got water and would not have committed suicide
 abaki baar congress main adhyaksh pad ko lekar rahul or sonia ke naam par tanatani mukhar dikhi he
 While Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Kamal Nath are often seen directly recommending Rahul Gandhi as the party president, there is a section which does not seem to be particularly happy with Rahul
 congress netaa is baat se naakhush hai ki rahul is najuk samay main kyon gaayab hai
 At a time when Sonia Gandhi is constantly touring to increase mass base and gain lost confidence in people, Rahul is absent
 land bill ko rahul gandhi kaa baby kaha jaataa tha
 In such a situation, when all the agitations on the land bill and debate on it were held in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi was not even present at that time
 dedh maheene se vah raajnneetik paridrishy se puri tarah se gaayab hai
 In such a situation, Sandeep Dixit, the former MP of the party and son of Sheila Dixit, said that Sonia Gandhi needs to continue as president in the present circumstances
 unhone iske peeche tark diya ki congress party abhi jis daur se guzar rahi he, usamen uskaa sabase bada general hi netritv kare to thik he
 Sandeep said, 'rahul Gandhi is a capable leader, but whenever i have to choose, then Soniaji will be our best general
 ' yahaan bataa den ki do baar saansad rah chuke sandip ek baar yah bhi kah chuke hai ki 97 se 99 fisadi congressi sonia gandhi ko apana netaa maanate hai or is bare main koi do raay nahin he
 However, Congress leader Renuka Chaudhary says that there is no question of choosing one from either Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki sabaki aawaaj hamen sunani hogi or sonia gandhi chunki hamen 10 saal se lead kar rahi hai
 On our channel, when Renuka Chaudhary was asked by our MD Onidio who would be on the post of president, Renuka was quite upset when asked
 unhone kaha ki media ne rahul gandhi ko adhyaksh banaae jane kii khabaron ko dikhaaya or yah afvaah kahaan se ai
 He has completely rejected the news of Rahul Gandhi's 'coronation' in April
 haalia khabaron ke mutabik, ab sitambar se pehle rahul kii tajposhi hone kii sambhaavna nahin he
 By the way, it is being said that Rahul Gandhi will also participate in the huge rally led by the Congress on April 19
 aise main rahul ke liye sabase badi chunauti yah hogi ki unhen party ke sabhi dhadon kaa vishwaas jeetna hoga
 But this will happen when he returns, for now, only speculation is left
 2019 world cap kareeb-kareeb apane aadhe padaav tak pahunch chukaa he
 The 10 countries participating in the tournament are trying to give their best to win the World Cup trophy
 17 june tak world cap main khele ja chuke 23 maichon main kareeb 9000 ran koote gaye hai
 Also, Bollers has taken 270 wickets
 england main world cap ke aayojan kii vajah se ummid kii ja rahi thi ki yahaan kii pich yaa to batting ke makul flats treks hongi yaa phir pes bolers kii pasand ke anusaar green top hongi
 In such a situation, the same speculations were being made that the England pitches hardly gave any benefit to the spinners
 lekin hairat kii baat he ki maujuuda world cap spinners ko bhi bada kuch de rahaa he
 The Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) analyzed the performance of spinners from teams from ten countries participating
 khangaal ki wo abhi tak kitne kargar rahe hai
 In all teams, spinners are proving to be a strong support for their pace bowlers
 ausatan spinners har match main 3 wicket le rahe hai
 Overall, he has taken 59 wickets in this World Cup so far
 ye sabhi gire 270 wicket kaa 20% baithta he
 There are four teams participating in the World Cup, whose spinners have taken more than 30% of the wickets for their team's total
 dilachasp he ki afghanistan ke spinners ne apni team ke pesars ke baraabar hi wicket liye hai
 On the other hand, the spinners of Bangladesh and India have taken around 40% of the total wickets for their team
 isi pariprekshya main england main hi 1999 main hue world cap ko dekha jaae to sabhi bhagidaar tiimon ke spinners ne kul gire viketon main se kareeb 15% hi apane naam kiye the
 There were a total of 548 wickets in that World Cup, out of which only 87 wickets could take spinners
 haalanki is world main spinners kahin behatar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Among the spinners, South Africa's Imran Tahir has been the best performer so far
 taahir ne ab tak chaar match khele hai jinamein 8 wicket jatke hai
 Against Afghanistan, Tahir took four wickets for 29, which is why Afghanistan were dismissed very cheaply
 jahaan tak bharat kaa sawaal he to chinamen bowler yujavendra chahal ne bhi dakshin africa ke khilaaf shuruaati match main hi chaar wicket jatke
 Both Chahal and Tahir are still in the top 10 bowlers' list for wickets in the tournament
 abhi toornament main 25 match baaki he
 It will be interesting to see if the spinners are able to perform similarly well
 hindu samaaj party ke adhyaksh kamalesh tiwari kii hatya maamle main postmortem report aa gai he

 On the one hand, the ongoing rebellion against President Bashar al-assad in the country, on the other hand, the evil eye of Baghdadi on Syria
 teesri taraf apane hi avam par syrian sarkaar kaa rasinic hamalaa
 Amidst all this, the US air strike on Syria's airbase
 haal ke varshon main shaayad hi koi mulk aisi haalat se do-chaar hua ho jahaan zindaa rahanaa vaaki kisi kamaal se kam naa ho
 In this video below, these are the pictures of one attack after another in Syria, where after one of the recent chemical attacks, one of the most powerful countries in the world, the US has directly opened the front against the Syrian government
 bumadhya sagar main khadaa ek vishaal america yudhpot lagaataar khatarnaak mixilon se syria ke us faujee airbase ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he, jahaan se begunaah shahriyon par rasinic hamalaa karne kaa ilzaam he
 In another way, this American attack is actually a revenge for the recent chemical attack in Syria, in which more than a hundred innocent people, including many innocent children, were tortured and killed
 chemical atake ke baad hua ye hamalaa apane aap main ek badi baat he
 But the most dangerous thing is that America and Russia have once again come face to face regarding this attack on Syria
 kyonki rus shuru se hi syrian sarkaar or khaaskar vahaan ke raashtrapati bashar al asad kii himaayat karata rahaa he
 Assad's army for chemical attack: This time too, the world is undoubtedly considering Assad's army as chemical attack, but Russia stands with Syrian President Assad
 syrian toun khan shekhaun main chemical atake kii in dardanaak tasveeron ko dekhakar vaise to duniya pehle hi baichaiyn ho gai thi
 These pictures of the suffering of small and innocent children had shaken everyone
 in hamalon ke foran baad hi america ne saafe kar diya tha ki wo is par chup nahin baith saktaa
 From President Donald Trump to the US State Secretary, he had not only condoned the attack, but also advised Russia to think afresh about its relations with Syria
 iske baad america ne ye hamalaa kar ye bhi jataa diya ki is baar baat sirf majammat tak mahadood nahin rahegi
 On Thursday night, at around quarter to nine, the US opened the mouth of the dreaded Tomahawk missiles towards Syria and then the process continued intermittently
 6 se zyaada syrian fauziyon ke maare jane kaa daawine mixilon ke nishane par thi homes kaa syrian airbase jahaan se chemical hamale ke liye jahaajon ke udaan bharne kaa shaq tha
 This light, glowing in the dark, can look beautiful on one hand, but it is such a glow of missiles, whose heat can only be felt by those who see them falling around them
 ab syrian fuj ke saath kuch aisa hi ho rahaa he
 While the US has claimed more than six Syrian troops killed after the attack, it has said that the attack destroyed several aircraft and ammunition stored in the military's warehouse
 syria kii baat karen to, vahaan vidrohiyon ke saath sarkaar kii puraani adaavat he
 In this rebellion, sometimes the rebels get ahead of their limits, sometimes the government forgets that they have some responsibility as rulers
 mangalvaar subah syria main hue chemical atake kaa vaakya asal main syrian hukmran yani vahaan ke raashtrapati bashar al asad ke isi ravaiye kaa sabase afsosna subut he
 More than a hundred deaths were caused by serine gas, the ground for renewed attack on Syria was ready when the world saw humanity dying in Syria on Tuesday
 chemical atake ke baad kaufanaak cerin gas kaa shikaar ban sau se zyaada log tadap-tadap kar maare gaye or inamen sabase buree haalat un chote-chote bacchon kii thi, jo hawa main ghule zehar kii maar bardaasht hi nahin kar sake
 This was the date when the US made it clear that it could no longer sit silent on the excesses of Syrian President Bashar al-assad
 syrian fuj or vidrohiyon ke bich jang kaa silsilaa nayaa nahin he
 But since the Nizam's revenge in the US, Syrian President Bashar al-assad's relief days began
 vajah ye ki rus to pehle se hi khul kar syria ke saath khadaa tha, jabaki america ke nae raashtrapati donold trump ke saath bhi rusi raashtrapati bladimir putin ke rishte achche maane jate hai
 This is the reason why the United States was constantly calling the end of ISIS in Syria as its target, but Assad had not yet turned his eyes on it
 asad ko chetavanee dete hue kar diya hamalisi khushrahmi main asad kii fuj ne wo kar diya, jisane sivaay rus ke maanon puri duniya ko ekaek uske khilaaf laa khadaa kiya, or ye tha syria main apni hi avam par kiya gaya chemical atake
 How many of the Syrian army carried out so far with the intention of teaching the rebels a lesson, but no one could think of what happened in the Syrian town of Khan Shekhaun at half past four in the morning of 4 April
 cerin gas ke ek khaufnak hamale main dheron bacchon samet sau se zyaada log maare gaye or asad or uski hukumat ekaek sabake nishane par aa gai
 Now call it the compulsion of US President Trump or something else, he not only warned Assad but also attacked Syria
 guuruuvaar kii raat ek ke baad ek 59 tomahok mixilon se syria main homes kaa faujee airbase dahal gaya
 However, America had already indicated this
 yues secretary rex tilersan ne jahaan do took shabdon main is chemical atake kii ninda kii, vahiin rus ko bhi asad ke saath dene ke maamle par gambhirtha se sochane kii salaah di
 The Syrian journalist called the attack Trump's annoyance
 Tillerson said that Assad had no right to rule his people
 haalanki america ke is hamale ke khilaaf bhi pratikriyaayein saamne aane lagi hai
 According to the famous Syrian journalist Vel Awwad, this is a sign of Trump's annoyance, which is not even approved by the UN Security Council
 philhal haalat ye he ki rus ko chhodkar is duniya main shaayad hi koi aisa mulk hoga, jo asad ke saath khadaa ho
 This is the reason why Assad was the target of the world after the chemical attack, while Russia cleaned up by saying that the Syrian army did not fire chemical bombs, but its rocket fell on the chemical warehouse of the rebels and caused havoc
 vaise duniya syria menchemical atekako lekar chaahe jo kuch kahe, bashar al asad bhi rukanevaale logon main nahin he
 Even after this attack, he heavily bombed the rebels' bases in the Hema area, in which many townspeople are suspected of being targeted
 syrian fitergets ban gaye kabadair strip se lekar hanger to kair zameendos hue hi
 More than six soldiers were also killed
 jabaki airbase par maujuud syria ke zyaadaatar fitergets dekhte hi dekhte kabad ban gaye
 This is certainly a big blow to Syria and its army
 guuruuvaar kii raat syrian aasmaan par chamake in maut ke parindon ne zamin par aisi tabaahi machaai ki agali subah jab suraj kii kirane dharti tak pahunchi, tab dur-dur tak tabaahi ke nishaan bikhare pade the
 While 59 warheads of America's dreadful Tomahawk missiles killed 6 Syrian troops, 9 fighter aircraft were also permanently turned into junk
 subah homes ke syrian airbase se jo tasviren baahar nikaleen, wo raat kii tabaahi kii kahani bayaan kar rahi thi
 In many places the debris of the concrete hangar on top of the plane standing under the hangar fell so that the airplane was standing and scraped
 or to or america mixilon ke hamale main syria ke gola barood ke bhandar kaa ek hissaa bhi barbaad ho gaya
 The US began to speculate about the attack on the Syrian airbase on the military airbase of the devastation that a Russian TV channel claimed, with many such pictures, that the attack destroyed nine Syrian fighter ships
 kuch tasveeron main ranve or air strip ke kuch ilaake bhi toote hue nazar aa rahe the
 On Thursday night, the US targeted Syria's military airbase with a warship deployed in the Mediterranean Sea near Syria
 trump prashasan ne beshak in hamalon ko syrian raashtrapati bashar al asad ko sabak sikhaane kii karrwai bataaya ho, jaankaron ko maananaa he ki is america hamale se is ilaake main tanaav kaafii bad gaya he
 However, the biggest irony among the current situation in Syria is that despite such a large scale chemical attack, the UN Security Council, the UN Security Council could not have an opinion on the investigation of this attack
 aise main ye sawaal ab bhi ek raaj hi he ki akhir chemical atake ke peeche asli gunahagaar koun he?aies ne bhi shuru kiya maut kaa khelye or baat he ki duniya is hamale ke peeche syria ke raashtrapati ko hi kusuuravaar maanati he
 The Syrian government was still struggling with the Syrian government and rebels fighting
 isi bich aies ne bhi maut kaa khel shuru kar diya
 The Syrian people have to bear its brunt
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki ab tak grih yuddh, bagdadi or duusare guton ke hamalon main lakhon siriai nagarikon kii jaane ja chuki hai
 Millions of Syrians are crying tears of blood right now
 ek taraf syrian raashtrapati bashar al asad apni gaddi kisi bhi keemat par chhodane ko taiyaar nahin, duusari tarafabagdadior lebanani hizbulla gut ke log syrian raashtrapati kii hukumat ukhaadnaa chaahate hai
 The general population of Syria is suffering in this fight
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, syria main jari khooni sangharsh main ab tak teen lakh se zyaada log maare ja chuke hai
 According to the figures released by the United Nations for 2013-2014, the news of the death of about 93 thousand people had been revealed and now this figure is increasing day by day
 chemical atake ke baad tej ho gai ladayeesamyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar sanghathan kaa kahana he ki syria main har maheene logon kii maut ho rahi he
 While more than one crore have been rendered homeless so far
 syria main akele bagdadi ke sanghathan aies ne hajaaron begunaahon ko maut ke ghat utaara he
 Until now, Russia also wanted to save Assad's throne in Syria by frequent air strikes
 roosi hawaii hamalon main vidrohiyon ke saath aam siriai janata bhi shikaar hui
 Hunger and death figures in Syria are increasing day by day
 ye khooni sangharsh agar vakt rahete nahi rukaa to syria puri tarah barbaad ho jayega
 Overall, the Syrian war has intensified after the chemical attack, and when and where it will end, no one knows at the moment

 How grievous this shortage is, it seems from the reply of Union Labor and Employment Minister Santosh Gangwar in the Lok Sabha on July 4 that about 7,00,000 government posts were vacant in March 2018

 team anna ke pramukh sadsy arvind kejariwal ne bhrashtachar ke mudde par narendra modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha he ki gujarat main bhrashtachar kaa khulaa khel chal rahaa he, lekin mukhyamantri modi apane logon par mukadmaa chalaane kii ijaajat dene kii bajaay unako sangrakshan de rahe hai
 Asked if Modi is corrupt, Kejriwal said, "I have no proof on the basis of which Modi can be said that Modi is corrupt, but Modi is giving protection to his cabinet colleagues surrounded by corruption charges
" vah unke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii ijaajat nahin de rahe hai or beete nau saal se lokayukta niyukt nahin kar rahe hai

 bhartiya sena dwaara niyantran rekha (elosi) ke paar aatankiyon ke khilaaf sargical hamale ke baad pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye bharat vibhinn aarthik tathaa kootneethikupayon par bhi vichaar kar rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has used the growing economic and diplomatic influence of New Delhi to isolate Pakistan since the Uri attack
 gauratlab he ki aakaar main pakistan, bharat kaa paanchvaan hissaa he jabaki uski arthvyavastha hamaari arthvyavastha ke saatven hisse ke baraabar he
 The comments naam ujagar nahin karne kii shart par ek suraksha adhikari ne bataaya ki hamaara nayaa rukh rakshaatmak ke bajaay aakraamak hoga
 Under this, India will emphasize Pakistan's economy, internal security and international image, and establish it as a hideout and hideout of terrorist groups
 iske saath hi pakistan ke saath vyapaar ko khatm karne kaa vikalp par bhi vichaar ho rahaa he
 This trade also takes place through a third country such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
 haalanki yah behad simit or bharat ke paksh main he
 This measure to isolate Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more aggressive than the previous government, although experts are of the opinion that these could further increase tensions between the two countries
 uri hamale ke baad se pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nai dilli ke badhate aarthik or rajanyik prabhaav kaa upyog kiya he
 Significantly, Pakistan is one-fifth of India in size while its economy is equal to one-seventh of our economy
 tippaniyan On condition of anonymity, a security official said that our new stand would be aggressive rather than defensive
 iske tahat bharat, pakistan kii arthvastha, aantarik suraksha va antarrashtriya chhavi ko ujagar karte hue use ek asthir or aatanki samoohon ke thikaane ke rup main sthapit karne par jor degaa
 Along with this, the option of ending trade with Pakistan is also being considered
 yah vyapaar sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) jaise tisare desh ke ke jariye bhi hota he
 However it is very limited and in favor of India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main pakistan ko alag -thalag karne ke yah upaay purvavarti sarkaar kii tulana main adhik aakraamak he haalanki visheshgyon kii raay he ki inase donon deshon ke bich tanaav or bad saktaa he

 Has the suspense of the seat of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Sumitra Mahajan and Kailash Vijayvargiya in Madhya Pradesh become a complication for the BJP? In the current situation, the candidates of the three seats Bhopal, Indore and Vidisha were named on hold, these three are the seats occupied by the BJP for three decades
 teen diggajon ne in teenon siton par bijepi ke sameekaran bigaad rakhe hai
 The BJP has announced the names of 18 of the 29 candidates for the Lok Sabha elections, but Mathapachhi is running on these three strong or rather, bjp's stronghold seats
 in siton par bijepi ke sameekaran bigaadane vaale or koi nahin balki mamaa yani purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan, tai yani loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan or bhai yani bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ko mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Chief Minister Kamal Nath is taking a dig at this saying that the BJP is sweating
 vah salaah de rahe hai ki bijepi candidet ke liye vigyaapan nikaal le
 Responding to the queries of journalists, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said that the BJP is sweating and now if the advertisement of which candidate will fight for it, BJP will probably get a candidate
 bhopal se digvijay kaa daanvdarasal, congress jin teen siton ke liye bijepi par mamaa, tai or bhai kaa tanj kas rahi he unamem bhopal kii baat karen to congress kii taraf se 10 saal mukhyamantri rahe digvijay singh yahaan se maidan main hai
 Hence the pull on this is about two names, Mama i
e
 Shivraj and Bhai i
e
 Kailash Vijayvargiya
 vahiin indore se kareeb 30 saal se chunaav jitati ain tai yani sumitra mahajan or takaraar bhai yani kailash vijayawargeey ke bich main chal rahi he
 So after Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj's declaration of not contesting the election, now Sadhana Singh, wife of former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan from Vidisha seat, is embroiled
 yahi vajah he ki teenon siten ab tak bijepi tay nahin kar pai he ki kisko utaara jaae
 In such a situation, BJP leader Gopal Bhargava says that Tai, Bhai and Mama are not part of democracy, all three are traditional seats of BJP
 hamaara ummidavaar camel kaa phool he, party bijepi or netaa sirf narendra modi hai
 Bhargava said, 'as far as i believe in democracy, no Tai is a brother, no maternal uncle
 bhartiya janata party main vyaktiyon kaa mahatv nahin hota he koi bhi vahaan se chunaav ladega
 All three are traditional seats of BJP, we have been winning here for almost three decades, no one will contest elections, victory will be ours
 baharhaal, siyaasi charchaa main jo kuch bhi ho lekin bijepi bakhubi samaj rahi he ki vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad loksabhaa main 29 siton main se maujuuda 26 siton par kaa kabiz party ke liye in siton ko bachaae rakhana badi chunauti he
 The biggest difficulty is that the perch is also getting entangled in those seats which till now are considered to be bjp's stronghold
 aise main bijepi ke hi diggaj netaaon ke bich takaraar kahin naa kahin bijepi ke ganit ko bigaad sakati he
 Every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox
 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator The notification of Bihar assembly elections can now be issued any day with the announcement of Election Commission
 is desh main har raajnneetik dal, har rajaneta, har raajnneetik kaaryakarta ko bas bihar ke chunaav ke parinaam kaa intjaar he
 But what will be the issue in this election? Will this election be fought on the issue of development as per the claims made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or on the question of return of Mandal 2 according to Lalu Yadav's speech at Swabhimaan rally at Gandhi Maidan? Or the issue is something else, which is causing reluctance in every major player involved in this game
 baat kuch aisi hi he
 This is the first election where development is not an issue as both Nitish and Narendra Modi live up to the scale of development
 donon ke raajnneetik kariyar main yahi ek samanta he ki jab bhi inhen mauka mila, inhone apane netritv se vikaas kii ek aisi lakeer khinchi, jiske inke virdohi bhi kaayal rahe
 Then the question is, what is the issue that has not seen such a personal and high profile, high tech campaign in the electoral history of Bihar
 aakhir ye koun sa mudda he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi chunaavon ke purv bihar main paanch chunavi sabha kar daalate hai, unki puri cabinet bihar ke har sudur kone kii parikrama kar chuki he
 More than 150 campaigning chariots have visited every village in Bihar before the election announcement
 ye aakhir koun sa mudda he ki nitish kumaar soshal media main fasebuk se twitor tak prachaar or apane virodhiyon khaskar pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamale karne kaa mauka nahin chhodte
 After all, what is the point that Nitish Kumar, Lalu Yadav and Congress leaders go home and give them arbitrary seats despite the opposition of their supporters
 darasal is bihar vidhansabha chunaav kaa ek hi mudda he badla, badla or hisaab-kitaab chukaane vaala badla, jisase apane raajnneetik virdohi ko raajnneetik jivan kii sabase badi haar kaa majaa chakhaaya jaae or ye virdohi hai narendra modi or nitish kumaar
 But you will question why Narendra Modi has got Nitish Kumar the Prime Minister's chair in the Lok Sabha elections last year, then why this argument
 sawaal laazmi he, lekin shaayad apni jeet or pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithne ke baad bhi narendra modi is baat ko nahin bhuule hai ki unhen bihar main teen chunaavon - 2005 ke november ke vidhansabha chunaav, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav - ke prachaar abhiyaan se dur rakhaa gaya
 And in these three elections, the number of seats increased under Nitish's leadership
 ye baat alag he ki jab pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaavon main modi ke naam par vot maange gaye, tab bhi bihar main unke gathbandhan ko sarvaadhik siten milin
 But Modi is not just one of the leaders to be satisfied with this and in the assembly elections he wants to prove once again that if the people of Bihar were giving majority figures to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), then Nitish was just a mask
 
 or agar kisi sthaneey netaa ko project nahin bhi kiya jaae, jaisaa is baar ke chunaav main ab tak ho rahaa he, tab bhi bihar main narendra modi bahumat kaa aankada dilaa sakate hai
 And perhaps Modi is unable to forget the condition of inviting him to the banquet because of an advertisement even more than that or Nitish Kumar returned Kosi assistance of 5 crores of Gujarat government
 ye teen aise kaaran hai, jiske chalate pradhanmantri narendra modi nitish kumaar se ek baar phir badla lene kaa mauka nahin chuknaa chaahate
 For how serious Prime Minister Modi is to take revenge, you can see that in the last one month, he has taken every step which he was being demanded or pressurized for months
 wo chaahe bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko waapas lene kaa nirnay ho, yaa purv sainikon ke liye lambit van rank van pension kaa maamla, yaa arab desho kii yatra main masjid jane kaa mauka, yaa phir bihar ke liye 1 lakh karod se adhik ke package kii ghoshnaa ho
 The reasoning behind all this is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reputation is at stake in Bihar elections, so he does not want the Nitish-led coalition to get any benefit
 darasal wo apane badale kii script main jeet ke liye kisi bhi masaale se parhez nahin karnaa chaahate or agar pradhanmantri modi ne mujffarpur main nitish ke diene main khot bataaya, yaa bihar main bijli kii sudhari haalat ke baavjood logon se bijli he, bijli ai kaa samvaad ye sab kahin na kahin unki badla lene kii betaabi ko darshata he
 Now Nitish Kumar talks
 vah naa keval pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main maatr 2 siten milane se khaar khaae baithe hai, or unhen lag rahaa he ki agar vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet mil jaae to narendra modi se hisaab baraabar kiya ja saktaa he
 In pure words, it can be changed
 nitish 2004 main loksabhaa chunavon ke parinaam aane ke baad se ye maan baithe the ki is desh main modi ke saath rahanaa yaa dikhnaa khaskar bihar ke rajantik paridrishy par pratikul parinaam hi de saktaa he
 His belief was further strengthened by the 2005 November 2009 Lok Sabha results and the 2010 Assembly results
 or isi aadhaar par or bijepi ke kuch sheersh netaaon kii salaah par unhone narendra modi ke mudde par bijepi ko by-by to kar hi daalaa, lekin unhone ek chook kii, modi ke khilaaf apane abhiyaan ke bare main apane samarthak votaron ko vishwaas main nahin le paae
 Especially the Muslim and extremely backward community on which he broke away from the BJP in the hope of support, he promised him to wait till the assembly elections and supported the RJD and BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin badla nitish ko bhi lenaa he, isliye nitish dushman kaa dushman dost hota he vaali niti apana rahe hai
 First ended the lack of communication in his relations with Lalu Yadav and secured the honor of deciding the victory of his party candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections, then coordinated the seats in the assembly by-elections and later adopted the same formula for the seats for the assembly elections
 It also coordinated
 ye baat alag he ki badale kii is raajnneeti main nitish ke congress party or khaskar sonia gandhi or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se najdiki se samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ab naaraaz hai
 Mulayam's displeasure will be very expensive, but before Ha Chunav, he has definitely done the work of adding hemp to the color
 tippaniyan Nitish has taken many decisions one by one to take revenge on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he himself would have been a big critic of in the ordinary days
 sabase pehle unhone apane party ke bahubali vidhayak anant singh ko jail kaa rasta dikhaaya
 It is being argued that Anant Singh went to jail for his own reasons, but everyone knows that if Anant Singh was not an accused in the murder of a Yadav caste child nor did Lalu Yadav make him a question of prestige, then Patna Police It would not have been taken against iske alaava nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne kai jatiyon jaise taili ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil kiya, vahiin kai jatiyon jaise mallaah jaisi prabhavi ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii maang ko mana
 Also announced a pay scale for the teachers working on the contract
 har vah tabaka jisaki niyukti anubandh par hui he, unke vetan badhaane kii maang ko maananaa ye dikhaata he ki nitish apane badale kii raajnneeti ke prati kitna gambheer hai
 Actually, Nitish's grand alliance knows that every single vote is important in this election
 sabase zyada mahila matadaataaon kii saalon kii madh nishedh kii niti ko lagu karne kii maang ko maananaa bhi nitish kii isi raajnneeti kaa ek hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 But where Nitish may be leading the revenge of Narendra Modi, but whether he is former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi or Ram Vilas Paswan or Upendra Kushwaha, all are going to be at the behest of Narendra Modi and BJP today
 His only goal is to somehow get revenge on Nitish Kumar
 or iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi se badhiya captain nahin ho saktaa or na hi bijepi se acchhee koi har maamle main suvidha sampann party
 But Lalu Yadav and the Congress, standing behind Nitish, all know that in today's politics and that too in the arena of Bihar, he cannot be the face of his team to take revenge on Modi better than Nitish Kumar
 lekin is chunaav main mudda kya hoga? kya ye chunaav pradhanmantri narendra modi or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke ab tak ke daavon ke anusaar vikaas ke mudde par ladaa jayega yaa lalu yadav ke gandhi maidan main swabhimaan raily main bhaashan ke anusaar mandal 2 kii vaapasi ke sawaal par? yaa mudda kuch or he, jisase is khel main shaamil har pramukh khilaadi ke man main hichak ho rahi he
 This is the case
 ye pehla chunaav he jahaan vikaas mudda nahin, kyonki vikaas ke paimaane par nitish or narendra modi donon khare utarate hai
 The only similarity in the political career of both is that whenever they got an opportunity, they drew such a line of development from their leadership, which their opponents were also convinced
 tab sawaal he ki aakhir vah koun sa mudda he jisane bihar ke chunavi itihaas main aisa vyaktigat or hai profile, hai tech prachaar abhiyaan nahin dekha
 After all, what is the issue that Prime Minister Narendra Modi holds five election meetings in Bihar before the elections, his entire cabinet has revolved around every corner of Bihar
 chunaav kii ghoshnaa se purv 150 se zyada prachaar rath bihar ke har gaanv kaa daura kar chuke hai
 What is the point that Nitish Kumar does not miss the opportunity to campaign in social media from Facebook to Twitter and attack his opponents, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aakhir ye koun sa aisa mudda he ki nitish kumaar, lalu yadav or congress netaaon ke ghar jate hai or apane samarthakon ke tamaam virodh ke baavjood unhen manamaani seat bhi dete hai
 Actually, the only issue of this Bihar assembly election is revenge, revenge and reimbursement, so that your political opponents should enjoy the biggest defeat in political life and these opponents are Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar
 lekin aap sawaal karenge ki narendra modi pichley hi saal nitish kumaar ko loksabhaa chunaav main dhul chataakar pradhanmantri kii kursi paa chuke hai tab ye tark kyon
 The question is simple, but perhaps even after his victory and sitting on the Prime Minister's chair, Narendra Modi has not forgotten that he has got three elections in Bihar - November 2005 assembly elections, 2009 Lok Sabha elections and 2010 assembly elections
 Kept away from campaigning
 or in teenon chunavon main nitish ke netritv main siton kii sankhya badi
 It is different that even when votes were sought in Modi's name in last year's Lok Sabha elections, his coalition got the most seats in Bihar
 lekin modi maatr isse santusht hone vaale netaaon main se nahin or vidhansabha chunaavon main wo ek baar phir sabit karnaa chaahate hai ki agar bihar kii janata bahumat kaa aankada rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan (endie) kii jholii main de rahi thi tab usamen nitish ek mukhauta maatr the
 And even if no local leader is projected, as is happening in this time's election, Narendra Modi can still get the majority figure in Bihar
 or shaayad modi usase bhi zyada ek vigyaapan ke kaaran unke bina bhoj main aamantran kii shart ko bhi bhul nahin paa rahe hai yaa nitish kumaar ne gujarat sarkaar ke 5 karod kii kosi sahaayta kii raashi lautaai
 These are the three reasons why Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to miss the opportunity to take revenge on Nitish Kumar once again
 pradhanmantri modi badla lene ke liye kitna gambhir hai, iske liye aap dekh sakate hai ki pichley ek maheene main unhone har wo kadam uthaae hai jinhen karne ke liye unke upar maheenon se yaa maang kii ja rahi thi yaa dabaab daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Be it the decision to withdraw the land acquisition bill, or the matter of pending One Rank One Pension for ex-servicemen, or the chance to visit mosques in Arab countries, or announce a package of more than 1 lakh crores for Bihar
 Ho
 sabake peeche ek hi tark diya gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bihar ke chunaavon main pratishtha daanv par lagi he isliye vah nahin chaahate ki nitish kii aguwai vaale gathbandhan ko koi laabh mili
 In fact, he does not want to avoid any spices to win in his revenge script and if Prime Minister Modi said something wrong in Nitish's DNA in Muzaffarpur, or there is electricity in Bihar despite the improved state of electricity, the communication of electricity came All of this shows their vain revenge
 ab baat nitish kumaar kii
 Not only is he resigned from getting just 2 seats in the Lok Sabha elections last year, and he feels that if he wins the assembly elections, then he can be accounted for by Narendra Modi
 shuddh shabdon main kahen to badla liya ja saktaa he
 After the results of Lok Sabha elections in 2004, Nitish had believed that staying or appearing with Modi in this country can only give adverse results especially in Bihar's political scenario
 unki is dharna ko 2005 november, 2009 loksabhaa parinaam or 2010 ke vidhansabha ke nateezon se or bal mila
 And on this basis and on the advice of some top BJP leaders, he has bypassed the BJP on the issue of Narendra Modi, but he made a mistake, not believing his pro-voters about his campaign against Modi
 Was able to take
 khaskar jis muslim or ati pichhadaa samudaay ke samarthan kii ummid par unhone bijepi se naata todaa, usne unhen vidhansabha chunaavon tak intjaar kaa vaada kar loksabhaa chunaav main argedy or bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 But Nitish also has to take revenge, so Nitish is adopting the policy of being an enemy of the enemy
 pehle lalu yadav se apane sambandhon main samvadaheenata khatm kii or samarthan lekar rajyasabha chunaavon main apni party ke ummidavaaron kii jeet tay kar izzat bachaai, phir vidhansabha up chunaavon main siton kaa talmail kiya or baad main vahi formula apana kar vidhansabha ke honevaale chunaavon ke liye siton kaa talmail bhi kar daalaa
 It is different that in this politics of revenge, Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav is now angry with Nitish's close proximity to Congress Party and especially Sonia Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 mulaayam kii naaraazgi kitni mahangi padegi, lekin ha chunavon ke purv unhone rang main bhaang daalane kaa kaam jarur karne kaa kaam kiya he
 The comments nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se badla lene ke liye ek se ek kai aise faisle liye hai, jo shaayad aam dinon main vah khud uske bade aalochak hote
 He first showed his party's Bahubali MLA Anant Singh the way to jail
 ye tark diya ja rahaa he ki anant singh apane kaarnon se jail gaye lekin sab jaanate hai ki anant singh agar ek yadav jati ke bachche kii hatya main aaropee na hote or na hi lalu yadav use pratishtha kaa prashn banaaya hota to patna police ne anant singh ke khilaaf ye karwaai nahin kii hoti
 Apart from this, Nitish Kumar's government included many castes like Teli among the most backward castes, while many castes like the dominant backward castes like Mallah accepted the demand for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes
 iske alaava contract par kaam karne vaale shikshakon ko vetanman dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Accepting the demand of increasing the salary of every section who has been appointed on the contract, it shows how serious Nitish is towards his revenge politics
 darasal nitish ke mahagathbandhan ko maaloom he ki is chunaav main har ek vot mahatvurna he
 It is also considered a part of Nitish's politics to accept the demand of most women voters to implement the policy of prohibition of alcohol for years
 lekin jahaan narendra modi se badla lene kii aguwai bhale nitish kar rahe hon, lekin nitish se badla lene ke liye wo chaahe purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi hon yaa ramvilas paswan yaa upendra kushvaha, sabhi agar aaj narendra modi or bijepi ke ishaare par chal rahe hai to unka ek hi lakshya he ki kisi bhi tarah nitish kumaar se badla liya jaye
 And for this, there cannot be a better captain than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, nor is there a better party than BJP in every respect
 lekin nitish ke peeche khadey lalu yadav or congress sab jaanate hai ki aaj kii raajnneeti main or vah bhi bihar ke akhaade main nitish kumaar se behatar modi se badla lene ke liye unki team kaa cheharaa nahin ho saktaa

 And for this, there cannot be a better captain than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, nor is there a better party than BJP in every respect
 lekin nitish ke peeche khadey lalu yadav or congress sab jaanate hai ki aaj kii raajnneeti main or vah bhi bihar ke akhaade main nitish kumaar se behatar modi se badla lene ke liye unki team kaa cheharaa nahin ho saktaa
 Then the question is, what is the issue that has not seen such a personal and high profile, high tech campaign in the electoral history of Bihar
 aakhir ye koun sa mudda he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi chunaavon ke purv bihar main paanch chunavi sabha kar daalate hai, unki puri cabinet bihar ke har sudur kone kii parikrama kar chuki he
 More than 150 campaigning chariots have visited every village in Bihar before the election announcement
 ye aakhir koun sa mudda he ki nitish kumaar soshal media main fasebuk se twitor tak prachaar or apane virodhiyon khaskar pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamale karne kaa mauka nahin chhodte
 After all, what is the point that Nitish Kumar, Lalu Yadav and Congress leaders go home and give them arbitrary seats despite the opposition of their supporters
 darasal is bihar vidhansabha chunaav kaa ek hi mudda he badla, badla or hisaab-kitaab chukaane vaala badla, jisase apane raajnneetik virdohi ko raajnneetik jivan kii sabase badi haar kaa majaa chakhaaya jaae or ye virdohi hai narendra modi or nitish kumaar
 But you will question why Narendra Modi has got Nitish Kumar the Prime Minister's chair in the Lok Sabha elections last year, then why this argument
 sawaal laazmi he, lekin shaayad apni jeet or pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithne ke baad bhi narendra modi is baat ko nahin bhuule hai ki unhen bihar main teen chunaavon - 2005 ke november ke vidhansabha chunaav, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav - ke prachaar abhiyaan se dur rakhaa gaya
 And in these three elections, the number of seats increased under Nitish's leadership
 ye baat alag he ki jab pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaavon main modi ke naam par vot maange gaye, tab bhi bihar main unke gathbandhan ko sarvaadhik siten milin
 But Modi is not just one of the leaders to be satisfied with this and in the assembly elections he wants to prove once again that if the people of Bihar were giving majority figures to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), then Nitish was just a mask
 
 or agar kisi sthaneey netaa ko project nahin bhi kiya jaae, jaisaa is baar ke chunaav main ab tak ho rahaa he, tab bhi bihar main narendra modi bahumat kaa aankada dilaa sakate hai
 And perhaps Modi is unable to forget the condition of inviting him to the banquet because of an advertisement even more than that or Nitish Kumar returned Kosi assistance of 5 crores of Gujarat government
 ye teen aise kaaran hai, jiske chalate pradhanmantri narendra modi nitish kumaar se ek baar phir badla lene kaa mauka nahin chuknaa chaahate
 For how serious Prime Minister Modi is to take revenge, you can see that in the last one month, he has taken every step which he was being demanded or pressurized for months
 wo chaahe bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko waapas lene kaa nirnay ho, yaa purv sainikon ke liye lambit van rank van pension kaa maamla, yaa arab desho kii yatra main masjid jane kaa mauka, yaa phir bihar ke liye 1 lakh karod se adhik ke package kii ghoshnaa ho
 The reasoning behind all this is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reputation is at stake in Bihar elections, so he does not want the Nitish-led coalition to get any benefit
 darasal wo apane badale kii script main jeet ke liye kisi bhi masaale se parhez nahin karnaa chaahate or agar pradhanmantri modi ne mujffarpur main nitish ke diene main khot bataaya, yaa bihar main bijli kii sudhari haalat ke baavjood logon se bijli he, bijli ai kaa samvaad ye sab kahin na kahin unki badla lene kii betaabi ko darshata he
 Now Nitish Kumar talks
 vah naa keval pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main maatr 2 siten milane se khaar khaae baithe hai, or unhen lag rahaa he ki agar vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet mil jaae to narendra modi se hisaab baraabar kiya ja saktaa he
 In pure words, it can be changed
 nitish 2004 main loksabhaa chunavon ke parinaam aane ke baad se ye maan baithe the ki is desh main modi ke saath rahanaa yaa dikhnaa khaskar bihar ke rajantik paridrishy par pratikul parinaam hi de saktaa he
 His belief was further strengthened by the 2005 November 2009 Lok Sabha results and the 2010 Assembly results
 or isi aadhaar par or bijepi ke kuch sheersh netaaon kii salaah par unhone narendra modi ke mudde par bijepi ko by-by to kar hi daalaa, lekin unhone ek chook kii, modi ke khilaaf apane abhiyaan ke bare main apane samarthak votaron ko vishwaas main nahin le paae
 Especially the Muslim and extremely backward community on which he broke away from the BJP in the hope of support, he promised him to wait till the assembly elections and supported the RJD and BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin badla nitish ko bhi lenaa he, isliye nitish dushman kaa dushman dost hota he vaali niti apana rahe hai
 First ended the lack of communication in his relations with Lalu Yadav and secured the honor of deciding the victory of his party candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections, then coordinated the seats in the assembly by-elections and later adopted the same formula for the seats for the assembly elections
 It also coordinated
 ye baat alag he ki badale kii is raajnneeti main nitish ke congress party or khaskar sonia gandhi or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se najdiki se samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ab naaraaz hai
 Mulayam's displeasure will be very expensive, but before Ha Chunav, he has definitely done the work of adding hemp to the color
 tippaniyan Nitish has taken many decisions one by one to take revenge on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he himself would have been a big critic of in the ordinary days
 sabase pehle unhone apane party ke bahubali vidhayak anant singh ko jail kaa rasta dikhaaya
 It is being argued that Anant Singh went to jail for his own reasons, but everyone knows that if Anant Singh was not an accused in the murder of a Yadav caste child nor did Lalu Yadav make him a question of prestige, then Patna Police It would not have been taken against iske alaava nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne kai jatiyon jaise taili ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil kiya, vahiin kai jatiyon jaise mallaah jaisi prabhavi ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii maang ko mana
 Also announced a pay scale for the teachers working on the contract
 har vah tabaka jisaki niyukti anubandh par hui he, unke vetan badhaane kii maang ko maananaa ye dikhaata he ki nitish apane badale kii raajnneeti ke prati kitna gambheer hai
 Actually, Nitish's grand alliance knows that every single vote is important in this election
 sabase zyada mahila matadaataaon kii saalon kii madh nishedh kii niti ko lagu karne kii maang ko maananaa bhi nitish kii isi raajnneeti kaa ek hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 But where Nitish may be leading the revenge of Narendra Modi, but whether he is former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi or Ram Vilas Paswan or Upendra Kushwaha, all are going to be at the behest of Narendra Modi and BJP today

 ye baat alag he ki badale kii is raajnneeti main nitish ke congress party or khaskar sonia gandhi or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se najdiki se samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ab naaraaz hai
 Mulayam's displeasure will be very expensive, but before Ha Chunav, he has definitely done the work of adding hemp to the color
 tippaniyan Nitish has taken many decisions one by one to take revenge on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he himself would have been a big critic of in the ordinary days
 sabase pehle unhone apane party ke bahubali vidhayak anant singh ko jail kaa rasta dikhaaya
 It is being argued that Anant Singh went to jail for his own reasons, but everyone knows that if Anant Singh was not an accused in the murder of a Yadav caste child nor did Lalu Yadav make him a question of prestige, then Patna Police It would not have been taken against iske alaava nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne kai jatiyon jaise taili ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil kiya, vahiin kai jatiyon jaise mallaah jaisi prabhavi ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii maang ko mana
 Also announced a pay scale for the teachers working on the contract
 har vah tabaka jisaki niyukti anubandh par hui he, unke vetan badhaane kii maang ko maananaa ye dikhaata he ki nitish apane badale kii raajnneeti ke prati kitna gambheer hai
 Actually, Nitish's grand alliance knows that every single vote is important in this election
 sabase zyada mahila matadaataaon kii saalon kii madh nishedh kii niti ko lagu karne kii maang ko maananaa bhi nitish kii isi raajnneeti kaa ek hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 But where Nitish may be leading the revenge of Narendra Modi, but whether he is former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi or Ram Vilas Paswan or Upendra Kushwaha, all are going to be at the behest of Narendra Modi and BJP today
 His only goal is to somehow get revenge on Nitish Kumar
 or iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi se badhiya captain nahin ho saktaa or na hi bijepi se acchhee koi har maamle main suvidha sampann party
 But Lalu Yadav and the Congress, standing behind Nitish, all know that in today's politics and that too in the arena of Bihar, he cannot be the face of his team to take revenge on Modi better than Nitish Kumar
 sawaal laazmi he, lekin shaayad apni jeet or pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithne ke baad bhi narendra modi is baat ko nahin bhuule hai ki unhen bihar main teen chunaavon - 2005 ke november ke vidhansabha chunaav, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav - ke prachaar abhiyaan se dur rakhaa gaya
 And in these three elections, the number of seats increased under Nitish's leadership
 ye baat alag he ki jab pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaavon main modi ke naam par vot maange gaye, tab bhi bihar main unke gathbandhan ko sarvaadhik siten milin
 But Modi is not just one of the leaders to be satisfied with this and in the assembly elections he wants to prove once again that if the people of Bihar were giving majority figures to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), then Nitish was just a mask
 
 or agar kisi sthaneey netaa ko project nahin bhi kiya jaae, jaisaa is baar ke chunaav main ab tak ho rahaa he, tab bhi bihar main narendra modi bahumat kaa aankada dilaa sakate hai
 And perhaps Modi is unable to forget the condition of inviting him to the banquet because of an advertisement even more than that or Nitish Kumar returned Kosi assistance of 5 crores of Gujarat government
 ye teen aise kaaran hai, jiske chalate pradhanmantri narendra modi nitish kumaar se ek baar phir badla lene kaa mauka nahin chuknaa chaahate
 For how serious Prime Minister Modi is to take revenge, you can see that in the last one month, he has taken every step which he was being demanded or pressurized for months
 wo chaahe bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko waapas lene kaa nirnay ho, yaa purv sainikon ke liye lambit van rank van pension kaa maamla, yaa arab desho kii yatra main masjid jane kaa mauka, yaa phir bihar ke liye 1 lakh karod se adhik ke package kii ghoshnaa ho
 The reasoning behind all this is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reputation is at stake in Bihar elections, so he does not want the Nitish-led coalition to get any benefit
 darasal wo apane badale kii script main jeet ke liye kisi bhi masaale se parhez nahin karnaa chaahate or agar pradhanmantri modi ne mujffarpur main nitish ke diene main khot bataaya, yaa bihar main bijli kii sudhari haalat ke baavjood logon se bijli he, bijli ai kaa samvaad ye sab kahin na kahin unki badla lene kii betaabi ko darshata he
 Now Nitish Kumar talks
 vah naa keval pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main maatr 2 siten milane se khaar khaae baithe hai, or unhen lag rahaa he ki agar vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet mil jaae to narendra modi se hisaab baraabar kiya ja saktaa he
 In pure words, it can be changed
 nitish 2004 main loksabhaa chunavon ke parinaam aane ke baad se ye maan baithe the ki is desh main modi ke saath rahanaa yaa dikhnaa khaskar bihar ke rajantik paridrishy par pratikul parinaam hi de saktaa he
 His belief was further strengthened by the 2005 November 2009 Lok Sabha results and the 2010 Assembly results
 or isi aadhaar par or bijepi ke kuch sheersh netaaon kii salaah par unhone narendra modi ke mudde par bijepi ko by-by to kar hi daalaa, lekin unhone ek chook kii, modi ke khilaaf apane abhiyaan ke bare main apane samarthak votaron ko vishwaas main nahin le paae
 Especially the Muslim and extremely backward community on which he broke away from the BJP in the hope of support, he promised him to wait till the assembly elections and supported the RJD and BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin badla nitish ko bhi lenaa he, isliye nitish dushman kaa dushman dost hota he vaali niti apana rahe hai
 First ended the lack of communication in his relations with Lalu Yadav and secured the honor of deciding the victory of his party candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections, then coordinated the seats in the assembly by-elections and later adopted the same formula for the seats for the assembly elections
 It also coordinated
 ye baat alag he ki badale kii is raajnneeti main nitish ke congress party or khaskar sonia gandhi or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se najdiki se samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ab naaraaz hai

 But Lalu Yadav and the Congress, standing behind Nitish, all know that in today's politics and that too in the arena of Bihar, he cannot be the face of his team to take revenge on Modi better than Nitish Kumar
 lekin modi maatr isse santusht hone vaale netaaon main se nahin or vidhansabha chunaavon main wo ek baar phir sabit karnaa chaahate hai ki agar bihar kii janata bahumat kaa aankada rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan (endie) kii jholii main de rahi thi tab usamen nitish ek mukhauta maatr the
 And even if no local leader is projected, as is happening in this time's election, Narendra Modi can still get the majority figure in Bihar
 or shaayad modi usase bhi zyada ek vigyaapan ke kaaran unke bina bhoj main aamantran kii shart ko bhi bhul nahin paa rahe hai yaa nitish kumaar ne gujarat sarkaar ke 5 karod kii kosi sahaayta kii raashi lautaai
 These are the three reasons why Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to miss the opportunity to take revenge on Nitish Kumar once again
 pradhanmantri modi badla lene ke liye kitna gambhir hai, iske liye aap dekh sakate hai ki pichley ek maheene main unhone har wo kadam uthaae hai jinhen karne ke liye unke upar maheenon se yaa maang kii ja rahi thi yaa dabaab daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Be it the decision to withdraw the land acquisition bill, or the matter of pending One Rank One Pension for ex-servicemen, or the chance to visit mosques in Arab countries, or announce a package of more than 1 lakh crores for Bihar
 Ho
 sabake peeche ek hi tark diya gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bihar ke chunaavon main pratishtha daanv par lagi he isliye vah nahin chaahate ki nitish kii aguwai vaale gathbandhan ko koi laabh mili
 In fact, he does not want to avoid any spices to win in his revenge script and if Prime Minister Modi said something wrong in Nitish's DNA in Muzaffarpur, or there is electricity in Bihar despite the improved state of electricity, the communication of electricity came All of this shows their vain revenge
 ab baat nitish kumaar kii
 Not only is he resigned from getting just 2 seats in the Lok Sabha elections last year, and he feels that if he wins the assembly elections, then he can be accounted for by Narendra Modi
 shuddh shabdon main kahen to badla liya ja saktaa he
 After the results of Lok Sabha elections in 2004, Nitish had believed that staying or appearing with Modi in this country can only give adverse results especially in Bihar's political scenario
 unki is dharna ko 2005 november, 2009 loksabhaa parinaam or 2010 ke vidhansabha ke nateezon se or bal mila
 And on this basis and on the advice of some top BJP leaders, he has bypassed the BJP on the issue of Narendra Modi, but he made a mistake, not believing his pro-voters about his campaign against Modi
 Was able to take
 khaskar jis muslim or ati pichhadaa samudaay ke samarthan kii ummid par unhone bijepi se naata todaa, usne unhen vidhansabha chunaavon tak intjaar kaa vaada kar loksabhaa chunaav main argedy or bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 But Nitish also has to take revenge, so Nitish is adopting the policy of being an enemy of the enemy
 pehle lalu yadav se apane sambandhon main samvadaheenata khatm kii or samarthan lekar rajyasabha chunaavon main apni party ke ummidavaaron kii jeet tay kar izzat bachaai, phir vidhansabha up chunaavon main siton kaa talmail kiya or baad main vahi formula apana kar vidhansabha ke honevaale chunaavon ke liye siton kaa talmail bhi kar daalaa
 It is different that in this politics of revenge, Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav is now angry with Nitish's close proximity to Congress Party and especially Sonia Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 mulaayam kii naaraazgi kitni mahangi padegi, lekin ha chunavon ke purv unhone rang main bhaang daalane kaa kaam jarur karne kaa kaam kiya he
 The comments nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se badla lene ke liye ek se ek kai aise faisle liye hai, jo shaayad aam dinon main vah khud uske bade aalochak hote
 He first showed his party's Bahubali MLA Anant Singh the way to jail
 ye tark diya ja rahaa he ki anant singh apane kaarnon se jail gaye lekin sab jaanate hai ki anant singh agar ek yadav jati ke bachche kii hatya main aaropee na hote or na hi lalu yadav use pratishtha kaa prashn banaaya hota to patna police ne anant singh ke khilaaf ye karwaai nahin kii hoti
 Apart from this, Nitish Kumar's government included many castes like Teli among the most backward castes, while many castes like the dominant backward castes like Mallah accepted the demand for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes
 iske alaava contract par kaam karne vaale shikshakon ko vetanman dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Accepting the demand of increasing the salary of every section who has been appointed on the contract, it shows how serious Nitish is towards his revenge politics
 darasal nitish ke mahagathbandhan ko maaloom he ki is chunaav main har ek vot mahatvurna he
 It is also considered a part of Nitish's politics to accept the demand of most women voters to implement the policy of prohibition of alcohol for years
 lekin jahaan narendra modi se badla lene kii aguwai bhale nitish kar rahe hon, lekin nitish se badla lene ke liye wo chaahe purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi hon yaa ramvilas paswan yaa upendra kushvaha, sabhi agar aaj narendra modi or bijepi ke ishaare par chal rahe hai to unka ek hi lakshya he ki kisi bhi tarah nitish kumaar se badla liya jaye
 And for this, there cannot be a better captain than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, nor is there a better party than BJP in every respect
 lekin nitish ke peeche khadey lalu yadav or congress sab jaanate hai ki aaj kii raajnneeti main or vah bhi bihar ke akhaade main nitish kumaar se behatar modi se badla lene ke liye unki team kaa cheharaa nahin ho saktaa
 For how serious Prime Minister Modi is to take revenge, you can see that in the last one month, he has taken every step which he was being demanded or pressurized for months

 It is being argued that Anant Singh went to jail for his own reasons, but everyone knows that if Anant Singh was not an accused in the murder of a Yadav caste child nor did Lalu Yadav make him a question of prestige, then Patna Police It would not have been taken against iske alaava nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne kai jatiyon jaise taili ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil kiya, vahiin kai jatiyon jaise mallaah jaisi prabhavi ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii maang ko mana
 Also announced a pay scale for the teachers working on the contract
 har vah tabaka jisaki niyukti anubandh par hui he, unke vetan badhaane kii maang ko maananaa ye dikhaata he ki nitish apane badale kii raajnneeti ke prati kitna gambheer hai
 Actually, Nitish's grand alliance knows that every single vote is important in this election
 sabase zyada mahila matadaataaon kii saalon kii madh nishedh kii niti ko lagu karne kii maang ko maananaa bhi nitish kii isi raajnneeti kaa ek hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 But where Nitish may be leading the revenge of Narendra Modi, but whether he is former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi or Ram Vilas Paswan or Upendra Kushwaha, all are going to be at the behest of Narendra Modi and BJP today
 His only goal is to somehow get revenge on Nitish Kumar
 or iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi se badhiya captain nahin ho saktaa or na hi bijepi se acchhee koi har maamle main suvidha sampann party
 But Lalu Yadav and the Congress, standing behind Nitish, all know that in today's politics and that too in the arena of Bihar, he cannot be the face of his team to take revenge on Modi better than Nitish Kumar
 iske alaava nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne kai jatiyon jaise taili ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil kiya, vahiin kai jatiyon jaise mallaah jaisi prabhavi ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii maang ko mana

 raibareli se priyanka gandhi nahin sonia gandhi hi chunaav ladengeen
 According to Congress sources, Sonia Gandhi has once again made up her mind to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Rae Bareli
 haalanki yah kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki sonia gandhi shaayad 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav na laden
 Sonia Gandhi's health was being cited as the reason behind this
 pichley dinon paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan sonia gandhi ne keval ek raily kii thi, vah bhi telugana main
 He did not hold a single rally in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 tabhi se rajnatik halkon main yah khabar joro par thi ki sonia is baar loksabhaa kaa chunaav nahin ladengi or priyanka unki jagah raibareli jaaengi
 These reports were further strengthened when Priyanka was made the General Secretary of the Congress and given the responsibility of Eastern Uttar Pradesh
 phir priyanka ke teen dinon ke lakhanu pravaas ke dauraan bhi prayagraj, phulpur or raibareli se aae kaaryakartaaon ne unase in jagahon se loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa anurodh kiya
 The people of Rae Bareli were the most pressurized
 raibareli kii janata priyanka se parichit hai kyonki ve sonia gandhi ke liye prachaar karti rahi hai
 Rae Bareli also lived with him
 raibareli ke log dilli aane par priyanka se hi milte the
 But now Congress sources have made it clear that Priyanka will not contest this time and will focus only on eastern Uttar Pradesh
 sonia gandhi 2004 se raibareli se saansad hai
 Prior to this, Sonia has been winning elections from Amethi

 loksabhaa main avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan rafel deal par rahul gandhi ke bayaan ke baad nayaa vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 In Parliament, Rahul Gandhi claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron told him during a meeting that there was no provision of confidentiality in the Rafael Deal and that Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman lied in Parliament at the behest of the PM
 nirmala sitaraman ne apane jawaab main rahul par hi galatabayani karne or sadan ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 At the same time, it has been clarified by the President of France that the agreement between the two countries is not to reveal the facts of the Rafale Deal
 france kii is safai ke baavjood rahul gandhi apane bayaan par kaayam hai
 Rahul Gandhi's statement in Parliament: The allegation of Rahul Gandhi that he was told by the President of France that there is no restriction of any kind of confidentiality in the Rafale agreement between the two countries
 sansad main avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan rafel deal par bolte hue congress adhyaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki desh kii raksha mantri ne rafel deal main kharch par khulaasa karne ke vaade ko puraa nahin kiya
 Rahul Gandhi said that the country's defense minister is sitting in the parliament
 unhone kaha tha ki vah jet kharidne main kharch hue paison kaa puraa byora dengi
 But later says that she cannot disclose the expenses because the Indian government has a confidentiality agreement with the French government
 rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya ki france ke raashtrapati ke saath hui unki mulaakaat main raashtrapati ne aisi kisi deal kii baat ko nakaar diya tha
 Rahul also said that at the behest of the PM, the Defense Minister lied about Rafael in the House
 rahul ke aarope par raksha mantri kii safirahul gandhi ke aarope par raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne france se rafel deal par safai dete hue kaha ki rahul gandhi or france ke raashtrapati ke bich hui baatcheet kaa koi byora unke paas nahin he
 Nirmala, citing an interview given to 'india Today' (defense Minister in Parliament did not name the media house), said that the French President told the Indian media that the Indian government was informed of the deal due to the commercial agreement
 Cannot be made public
 ise padhein: rafel par bole jetali, sawaal uthaane se pehle pranab se jaakar milen rahulfrance sarkaar kii safai‘bharat or france ke bich 2008 main hue suraksha samjhaute main praavdhaan he ki donon desh kisi aisi soochna ko saarvajanik nahin karenge jisase raksha saude se sambandhit hathiyaar athwa upkaran kii suraksha or kshamta par asar pade’ lihaaja is aadhaar par swaabhaavik he ki 23 sitambar 2016 main donon deshon ke bich 36 cafel jet or uske purjon ko kharidne kii hui deal main 2008 kaa yah samjhauta lagu hoga
 The President of France had publicly stated in an interview to India Today on March 9 that the agreement between the two countries is highly sensitive and important information related to it cannot be disclosed
 ’france kii safai par rahul gandhi kaa jawabafrance sarkaar dwaara safai jari karne ke baad rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ab bhale france sarkaar is baat ko nakaar rahi ho, yah unki marji he
 Rahul reiterated the claim that the President of France had said this to him
 rahul ne bataaya ki jis samay france ke raashtrapati ne yah baat kahi us samay unke saath congress netaa anand sharma or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi maujuud the
 What Macron had said in an interview with India Today on March 8 on the Rafale deal between India and France, French President Emmanuel Macron said that if India is exposed to some kind of debate with the opposition for some kind of debate on this issue The French government will not protest if it wants to raise
 india today ko die intervyuu main maikron ne kaha ki is deal main iconomic, industrial or stratagic hiton kaa puraa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 Read this: France's green signal, Modi government should openly debate the Rafael deal with the opposition
 However, Macron said that this deal has not been done during his tenure but he believes that both countries have benefited from this deal
 deal par barti ja rahi gopneeyata par maikron ne kaha ki donon deshon ke bich jab kisi maamle par behad sensitive bijness interest shaamil rahete hai to khulaase karnaa uchit nahin rahata
 Macron said that the companies competing under the commercial agreement in this deal should not be aware of the specifics of the deal
 yah commercial agreement kuch companiyon ke hiton se jude hai lihaaja inpar gopneeyata jaij he
 As soon as the proceedings started in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, the opposition started an uproar over the controversial statements of Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and Giriraj Singh

 aise main kam se kam is tarah ke vivaadit bayaan ke maamle main unhen khud aakar apane vichaar rakhane chahie
 Sharma said, 'I am worried even where the Prime Minister is at last?' On the other hand, TMC leader Derek o'brien took a dig at the pm's foreign visits and said that he understood that to call PM Modi in the Rajya Sabha Visa must be given
 haalanki, yah pehali baar nahin he jab derek is tarah kii bayaanbaji kar rahe hai

 unhone kaha ki vah dilli ke ek purv uparajyapal ke is bayaan se sahamat hai ki uttar bhartiya ‘niyam todane main garv mahasoos karte hai or unhen aisa karke majaa aata he
 He also commented on Kejriwal
 rigiju kii tippanee par pratikriya dete hue arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki desh ko alag-alag tukdon main mat bantie
 He tweeted and said, "rijiju ji, please don't divide the country into north-south, hindu-muslim
 sabhi bhartiya achche hai
 This is politics that we need to improve
 'rijiju ji, pl don't divide Indians into North n south Indians, Hindus n muslims
 All Indians r good
 It is politics that we need to improve— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)october 22, 2015rigijune police se sambandhit vishyon par ek think tanks ke udghaatan samaaroh main apane bhaashan ke dauraan kaha, ‘main dilli ke ek uparajyapal ke kuch saal puraane bayaan kaa gavaah hum
 He had said that the people of North India enjoy breaking the rules but by the evening they were forced to apologize
 ’2008 main tejendra khanna ne diya tha bayaanakendriya mantri ne kaha, ‘lekin mujhe lagata he ki jo unhone kaha tha vah sahi tha
 Although Rijiju did not name the Lieutenant Governor, the document states that the then Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Tejendra Khanna had commented in February 2008, "it is a specialty of North and West India to show respect to people for violating the law and making it boastful and Proud feels that no action was taken against him for this
 ’haalanki congress or bijepi ke virodh ke baad unhone apana bayaan waapas le liya tha
 Rijiju said that people here enjoy boasting that they have threatened a police officer
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki har cheez ke liye police ko jimmedaar tehraana sahi nahin he
 'the police will have to run the stick,' Rijiju said, 'many people say that the police has become very rude
 police keval tab ashisht hogi agar naagarik anushaasanheen honge
 If people will be disciplined, the police will not be rude
 lekin aamtaur par kaha jaataa he ki jab tak aap unhen danda se nahin peetenge, log nahin sunate
 'he said,' Here we say that people do not improve unless they give the rung
 lekin agar log thik nahin hai, anushaasanheen hai, das baar bolne ke baad nahin maanate hai to phir to danda to chalaanaa hi padegaa
 "first improve yourself and then accuse the Delhi Police

 He said, 'kejriwal keeps saying that the Delhi Police does not do this, it does not, but what will the police do if they do not improve themselves
 ’ police kaa bachaav karte hue unhone kaha ki kahin bhi kisi bhi ghatana yaa aparaadh ke liye police ko jimmedaar tehraana aasaan hota he lekin khaaki vardi vaale hi raatbhar jagakar shanti or kanoon vyavastha sunishchit karte hai
 Rijiju said, 'society will not improve by abusing the police

 China has threatened the world, including India, over the Tibetan religious leader the Dalai Lama
 china ne puri duniya ke netaaon or sarkaron ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki tibeti dharmaguru dalai lamas se mulaakaat karne ko ek gambhir aparaadh samajha jayega
 This is not the first time, when China has expressed strong opposition to the Dalai Lama, it has shown its stubbornness many times before
 china hameshaa se aarope lagaataa rahaa he ki dalai lamas tibet ko usase alag karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 China says that in order to build diplomatic relations with it, foreign governments will have to consider Tibet as part of China
 china kii sattadhari communist party of china (CPC) ke united front work department ke kaaryakari upaadhyaksh jhang yijiyong ne kaha ki kisi bhi desh yaa kisi bhi sanghathan kadalaai lamasse milane kaa nyauta sweekaar karnaa hamaari najar main chini logon kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane vaala ek gambhir aparaadh hoga
 Doing so would also be considered a violation of the commitment of the Chinese government to be legitimate
 jhang ne kaha ki china duusare deshon or netaaon ke 82 varshiya dalai lamas se ek dharmik netaa ke taur par milane ke kisi bhi tark kosvikaar nahin karegaa
 He said, 'I want to make it clear that the 14th Dalai Lama is a political figure under the guise of religion
 ' unhone bharat kaa naam liye bina kaha ki dalai lamas saal 1959 main apni mathrubhumi ko dhokhaa dekar duusare desh (bharat) bhaag gaye or nirvaasan main apni tathakthith sarkaar sthapit kii
 Actually, since 1959, Dalai Lama has been living in exile in India and there is also a Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala, Himachal
 is saal dalai lamas ko bharat ke arunachal pradesh samet uttar-purv ke kai hisson main daure kii anumati dene kaa bhi china ne kadaa virodh kiya tha
 However, India did not care at all about China's opposition
 itnaa hi nahin, china dalai lamas ko lekar kaaphi lambey arase se bharat par dabaav bana rahaa he
 Governments changed in India, but everyone's attitude towards the Dalai Lama remained the same

 The High Court said on behalf of the Delhi government that there are many minors in the reform houses who commit such violence and they also target government employees

 The Delhi Police also refuses to go inside, witnessing the minors during the violence, while the Juvenile Justice Board Committee and several organizations are also working to oversee the reforms

 After seeing these achievements of Virat Kohli, one can question Dhoni's captaincy and the selectors may be forced to remove him
 haalanki khilaadi ke rup main vah ab bhi kaaphi yogadan de sakate hai, lekin unki phinishing kshamta par sawaal hai
 The match was in India's hands when Dhoni was batting in the Delhi ODI under the recent ODI series against New Zealand, but Dhoni scored 39 runs in 65 balls while batting slow
 aakhirkaar bharat yah match chah ran se haar gaya tha
 In the first T20 match against Zimbabwe in June 2016, Dhoni scored 19 runs in 17 balls and India lost the match by just two runs
 aise hi kai or match rahe jinamein dhoni kaa balla jeet nahin dilaa paaya, jabaki kohli ne lakshya peechha karte samay kai jeet dilaai, to phir dhoni kii captaini par sawaal to uthne hi hai
 
 
 Now, if he did not do well in the ODI and T20 series against England, the matter could be serious

 a good novelist creates new tilism every time and takes the readers to a new world and takes the screen off mysteries
 aisi hi ek rahasyamay or romaanchak duniya kaa anaavaran kiya he bhagavaandas morwal ne apni nai aupnyasik kriti narak maseehaa main
 In Hell Messiah, the narrator introduces us to the characters and acts of social movements while presenting to us a pseudo-world of social movements

 The truth of any house is hidden in its porch, the hallway is just a theater of performance
 saamaajik andolanon ke pradarshnatmak chal ko hi duniya dekh paati he; osaare main ho rahe kriyalap se log anjaan hi rahete hai
 The political rise of AAP and the political aspirations and expectations associated with this novel are also evident in this novel

 The story has been told about how ngos exploit public sentiments and their frustration in a very secret manner by hiding the capitalist and imperialist conspiracy going on in the name of Osara-run mass movement
 is upanyaas main kai kahaniyaan hai
 Many stories seem complete in themselves — such as the story of Martha Ekka

 isamen duvidha se ghire or parajeet do paatr najar aate hai—gangadhar acharya, jo lute hue gandhi kii langot pakadakar ghist rahe hai or gandhi ke lutane kaa tamaasha dekh rahe hai
 The other 'prachanda', who are sitting on the collapsing plank, are the Communist leaders who are seeing the degradation of socialism

 Through these characters, Morwal has depicted Gandhian values and the downgrade of Marxist thought and movement
 krodhjanya pratirodh jab charam par pahunchataa he to vyangy main parinat ho jaataa he
 There is an undercurrent of satire throughout the novel with the narrator's resistance and anger at its peak
 morwal kii bhashaa ise or bhi jeevant banaati he
 Sometimes the incidents also make it feel repetitive
 morwal lok rang ke kathakaar hai or isamen jahaan-jahaan mevaat kii bhashaa or chata ai he, vahaan-vahaan ve apni rau main aa jate hai
 The story becomes juicy

 Gayatri Prajapati, who was a minister in the SP government led by Akhilesh Yadav, was accused of rape by a woman from Banda

 com / cy0dapu2mg The troubled Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Monday that he would neither resign nor go on leave, while anti-government protesters led by Imran Khan and Tahir ul Qadri kept pressure on him to step down
 raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon kii ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue navaj sharif ne kaha ki vah is tarah kii parampara nahin banane denge ki kuch log lakhon logon ke janadesh ko bandhak bana len
 The Express Tribune quoted Nawaz as saying, 'we have the rule of the Constitution here and we will not let anyone nullify it
 ' After the meeting, the joint declaration stated that Pakistan's future is in democracy and deviating from it is dangerous for the Union of Pakistan
 netaaon ne loktantr kii raksha main pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke sangharsh main puraa saath dene kii patibaddhta jataai
 According to Radio Pakistan news, all parliamentary parties decided to become parties in the petition filed in the Supreme Court for supremacy of Parliament
 netaaon ne sansad, pradhanmantri awaas or pitivi par hamale kii kadi ninda kii
 He said, 'these attacks are attacks on democracy and the country
 ' seenet main vipaksh ke netaa ne ghoshnaa kii ki agar kisi ne pradhanmantri awaas ko gherne kii koshish kii to raajnneetik netritv pradhanmantri awaas main pradhanmantri ke saath rahegaa
 Like every year another budget arrived
 ek mediakarmi hone ke naate pichley kai saalon se lagaataar main is 'ghatana' kaa ek darshak banataa aayaa hum
 Yes 
 
 is vaarshik aayojan se pehle arthvyavastha main nau fisadi kii hissedari rakhane vaale rail bajet kaa alag se prastutikaran bhi sansad ke patal par 'reharsal' ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 If the railway budget is called the 'trailer' of the general budget, then there will be no exaggeration
 pichley kuch saalon se to yah bhi pataa karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he ki yah ek aarthik aayojan he yaa raajnneetik
 
 
 
 desh main vikaas kii prakriya ko jari rakhane ke liye panchavarshiya yojana kaa khaakaa pesh karne kaa vidhaan banaaya gaya he
 The expenditure and income of the government has to be kept in the general budget, but the leaders have made it an annual 'celebration' of tax exemption or increase
 'nayaa suut' pahanakar sansad main rail or vitt mantri iske aguva banate hai
 On the basis of many previous experiences, it can be said that the big industrialists or say the rich benefit more than the provisions made in the budget
 nichle or madhyam varg ko kamobesh apana kharchaa badhata hua hi najar aata he
 This time though an additional charge of 10 per cent has been imposed on people with income above one crore, but in the last several years i do not remember that such a provision has come
 iske liye chidambaram badhai ke paatr hai
 However, behind this, the last budget of the current government and such demand arose from many parts of the country
 anyathaa tata, birla or ambani bhi 30 fisadi kii dar par hi kar chukaa rahe the
 Every time the erstwhile government is seen benefiting only its own party and people associated with the region
 balki ek tarah se ab ise saarvajanik rup se sweekaar bhi kar liya gaya he
 Leaders are also beginning to argue that what is wrong if the railway minister and finance minister take special schemes in their area
 
 
 ?tippaniyan Following new types of tax provisions, along with 'exit' are also suggested
 ucch varg ke paas puure sansaadhan hote hai in praavdhaanon se phayda uthaane ke
 
 
 If someone grinds it is the lower and middle class
 is aarthik-raajnneetik gathjod kaa tod philhal aam jan ke paas najar nahin aata
 Now the question is whether there is any need to present such annual budgets
 
 
 kya panchavarshiya yojana ke khaake main hi ise samahit nahin kar diya janaa chahie or bajet ko ek balance shit ke rup main hi pesh nahin kar diya janaa chahie
 
 
 So that leaders do not get another chance to get into cheap politics
 yaa
 
 
 If presenting the budget is so important, why not present a different budget for each department or sector and give every leader a chance to wear a 'new suit'
 
 
 
 For the last few years, it is becoming increasingly difficult to know whether it is an economic event or a political one
 
 
 
 To continue the process of development in the country, a legislation has been enacted to present the blueprint of the Five Year Plan
 aam bajet main sarkaar ke kharche or aamadani kaa hisaab-kitaab rakhana hota he lekin netaaon ne ise tex main chhot yaa badhotaree karne kaa salanaa 'utsav' bana diya he
 The Minister of Railways and Finance leads the Parliament in a 'new suit'
 pichley kai anubhavon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki bajet main kiye gaye praavdhaanon se zyada phayda bade udyogpatiyon yaa kahen ki amiron ko hi hota he
 The lower and middle classes see their expenses increasing more or less
 is baar haalanki ek karod se zyada aay vaale logon par 10 fisadi kaa atirikt prabhaar lagaaya gaya he lekin beete kai saalon main mujhe yaad nahin aata ki aisa koi praavdhaan aayaa ho
 Chidambaram deserves congratulations for this
 haalanki, iske peeche maujuuda sarkaar kaa aakhri bajet or desh ke kai hisson se uthi aisi maang zyada rahi
 Otherwise, Tata, Birla and Ambani were also paying taxes at the rate of 30 per cent
 har baar tatkaaleen sarkaar apane dal or kshetra se jude logon kaa hi phayda karaati najar ai he
 In a way, it has now been accepted publicly
 netaa yah tark bhi dete dikhne lage hai ki agar rail mantri or vitt mantri apane kshetra main vishesh yojanaon ko le jate hai to kya buraai he
 
 
 ? Comments nae tarah ke kar praavdhaanon ke baad 'nikal' jane ke raste bhi saath hi saath suza die jate hai
 The upper class has full resources to benefit from these provisions
 
 
 agar koi pisataa he to vah he nimna or madhyam varg
 The break of this economic-political alliance is not visible to the common people at present
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya vaaki is tarah ke salanaa bajaton ko pesh karne kii koi jarurat he
 
 
 Should it not be included in the plan of the Five Year Plan itself and the budget should not be presented as a balance sheet
 
 
 jisase netaaon ko sasti raajnneeti main padane kaa ek or mauka na mili
