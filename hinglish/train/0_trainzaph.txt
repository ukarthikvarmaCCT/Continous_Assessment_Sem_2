 On this special occasion, about 250 officers and employees performed various postures related to yoga at the headquarters of NIA

 The insurance agent simply does not believe his story
 phir paai ek aisi kahani gadhata he jisamen sher kii jagah vah manushyon ko apni kahani kaa kirdaar bana daalata he
 It then asks him: Which story are you sure of? After the demonetisation tsunami, Modi has captured the image of a great modern reformer who had no fear of taking risks and hurting his supporters because he had faith in his mind Was that what he was doing was in the larger interest of the nation
 unhone khud ko garibon ke nae maseehaa kaa rup de daalaa he or saath hi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang ladgaye vaale yoddha kaa bana bhi pahan liya he
 After completing half the journey of his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was well aware that his chance of becoming Prime Minister again in 2019 rests on this budget
 unhen is baat kaa ilham bhi tha ki kaale dhan ko jad se ukhaad phenkane kii unki auchak kavayad ko lekar vaise to vyapak samarthan maujuud rahaa, lekin ab unhen notebandi se hue jakhmon par thodaa maraham lagane kii jarurat he
 The Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections also stood at the head, where the bjp's defeat could have an impact on the remaining years of his tenure
 iske alaava kuch or ahm chintaaen thim
 Demonetisation had slowed India's economic pace and his government was forced to accept that GDP growth rate was 7
 5 fisadi se girakar 6
 Will come to 5 percent
 nijee kshetra kaa nivesh takreeban gart main ja chukaa tha or ahm kshetron ke munaafe or maang main giravat darj kii ja rahi thi
 Banks, under the burden of debt that had already sunk before demonetisation, were now cautious in lending to corporates, even though they now had a lot of money
 pradhanmantri ko desh main rojgaar ke pade akaal kii bhi gahari chintaa thi jisamen nakadi sankat kodh main khaaj kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, khaskar anaupchaarik kshetra kaa haal bura tha
 One indication was that employment in the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has reduced considerably in the current year
 yah sankat kaa spasht sanket tha
 The scenario was changing rapidly with Bregit (britain's separation from the European Union) and Donald Trump's victory at the international level, which was a sign of the reversal of globalization and the beginning of a new era of protectionism
 maang or aarthik vruddhi main vaishvik susti chaa rahi thi
 There was concern that emerging economies like India would now return foreign investment to countries like America
 paramparaagat niryaat kendrit vruddhi model jis par do dashak se yah desh poshit ho rahaa rahaa tha, vah ab ladkadaa rahaa tha
 Modi had tough options to choose from
 har kisi ko ummid thi ki ve arthvyavastha ko ek aisi tagdi khuraaq denge jo susti or patan ko durust kar ke jidipi kii vruddhi dar ko waapas 7 fisadi tak le aae
 While making the budget, Modi and Jaitley saved themselves from getting caught in financial audacity or populism
 iske bajaae unhone chaar ahm kshetron par jor diyah nivesh ko kaise badhaava mili, maang kaise paidaa kii jaae, rojgaar kaise paidaa hon or yah baat chaahe kitni hi avyaavhaarik kyon na lage, vittiya santulan kaise banaae rakhaa jaae
 There were two other concerns for Modi personally — one thing was clear in his mind that the budget should be such that underlines his pro-poor image
 iske alaava yah bhi ahm tha ki bajet is baat ko darshaae ki notebandi apane aap main koi saadhy nahin thi balki kaale dhan ke khilaaf jang main ek saadhan bhar thi
 That's why Modi and his team decided to take a risk and place their bets on India — an India whose villages and cities are inhabited by disadvantaged populations
 chunki badi puunji main vistaar kii gunjaaish kam thi, isliye nivesh ko badhaava dene ke liye faisla liya gaya ki ahm janakalyankari kaaryakramon or yojanaon par kharch badhaayaa jaae
 Instead of announcing new plans, however, the team insisted on increasing expenditure in key areas, especially in the infrastructure sector, which were already seeing good results
 sabase badhibia nattejey sadak kshetra main the jahaan jetali ne daawa kiya ki endie sarkaar ne 2014 main satta main aane ke baad 1,40,000 kimi lambii sadaken yani 160 kimi pratidin ke hisaab se sadaken banavaai hai
 64,900 crores for 2017-18 to the sector in their budget
 aavantit kiye gaye
 This is an increase of 12 percent
 chunki nirmaan kshetra mote taur par anaupchaarik tha, isliye nivesh main koi bhi badhotaree khaskar akushal mazdooron ke liye zyada rojgaar kaa sabab banati
 To give a boost to demand and employment, Modi and his team noticed the basic need of India that everyone needs a house besides bread and clothes
 har bhartiya ko ek makaan chahie jise vah ghar kah sake
 The Prime Minister's speech on the eve of the Budget and New Year contains several steps and concessions that serve to stimulate demand and investment in urban and rural housing sector
 inamen se ek faisla yah tha ki kifayati awaas ko infrastracchar kaa darja de diya jaae jo bank karj par byaaj daron ko kam karne main madadgaar hoga or saath hi pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke antargat 2019 tak ek karod makaan banane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya
 Instead of relying on big businesses in terms of employment generation, they decided to rely on very small, small and medium enterprises for this
 unhone ''chota hi acha" par focus kiya
 msmes are the focus of economic activity across the country and provide the highest employment
 isi kshetra par notebandi kii maar bhi sabase zyada padi thi
 Ironically, these enterprises 30
 3 fisadi kii prabhavi dar par kar chukaa rahe the jabaki bade udyogon ke liye yah dar 25
 Was 9 percent
 ek jatke main jetali ne un choti companiyon ke liye iskar ko ghataakar 25 fisadi kar daalaa jinka salanaa kaarobaar 50 karod ru
 Is up to kam kamaane waalon ke liye bhi takreeban yahi najariya apanaaya gaya jinaki aay 5 lakh ru
 Less so that they also feel good
 kar chukaane vaale kul 3
 80% of the 7 crore people fall in this income category
 inke liye jetali ne iskar ko takreeban shunya kar diya or daawa kiya ki isse protsaahit hokar bhavishya main zyada se zyada log iskar ritern daakhil karenge, jisase iskar kaa dayera vistrut hoga
 The high-income and middle-class people may be upset with this, but by doing so, Modi managed to give money in the hands of those who suffered the most due to demonetisation
 isse yah dobaaraa sabit hua ki unki sarkaar vanchiton ke haq main kaam karti he
 Two more things brought this balanced budget to full balance
 rajnatik chande se paidaa hone vaale kaale dhan par lagaam kasne ke liye modi jaanate the ki unhen jan pratinidhitiv kanoon main badlaav kar paanaa mushkil hoga kyonki unki party ke paas rajyasabha main bahumat nahin he
 That is why they used the budget for this and announced the system of electoral bonds to monitor the donations while reducing the size of the benami donations
 ant main, modi ne vittiya anushaasan ko bigaad dene kaa lobh sanvaran kar hi liya
 If they had chosen that path, it is possible that they would have received much appreciation on the domestic front but it would have posed the risk of inflation even though the government had recently claimed to keep it under control
 vaise bhi, kai videshi niveshkon ne notebandi kii khaasi aalochana kii thi or modi duniya ke saamne yah dikhaane ko aatur the ki unki sarkaar nirantarata, sthayitv or vittiya samekan main yakeen karti he, jaisaa ek adhikari ne bataaya, ''hamaare liye ek lakshmana rekha khinch di jise hamen paar nahin karnaa tha
 "he also took care not to announce any such scheme that would put him on the target of the Election Commission
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bharosa jataayaa ki unka chauthaa bajet pasa palatney vaala sabit hoga or is babat apane bhaashan main kaha, ''agar meraa lakshya sahi he, manzil mujhe dikh rahi he, hawa anukool he to main ud saktaa hum

 "prime Minister Narendra Modi is well aware that if he trusts his government and bureaucrats excessively in the matter of delivery, he will be stout
 bajet kii mukhya aalochana yah kii ja rahi he ki sarkaar ke dakhal ko kam karne ke bajaae isane vikaas main bharat sarkaar kii bhoomika ko or vistrut kar daalaa he
 The second criticism is that Jaitley did nothing to reduce subsidies on fertilizer and food items, but in the new budget
 vitt sachiv ashok lavasa ne aagrah kiya tha ki ve khaadya sabsidi ko kam nahin kar sakate kyonki zyada se zyada rajya ab rashtriya khaadya suraksha kanoon ke daayre main aa chuke hai
 He said that the government had done a lot to address the shortcomings and ensured that the subsidy could reach people directly through direct benefit transfer
 modi ke aalochak kehete hai ki agali peedi ke bare main sochane ke bajaae pradhanmantri kii nigaah hameshaa agle chunaav par rahati he
 It is also said that they only speak, they do less
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya modi ek mahaan sankatmochan hai jo bharat kii duubati naav ko sailaab se nikaalkar sampannataa or pratishtha kii ore le ja rahe hai? yaa phir ve ek aise badshaah hai jiske tan par kapade nahin hai or jald hi jiskaa pardaafash ho jayega? sawaal aapse he ki aap donon main se kis kahani par yakeen karte hai?

 i think people should have the freedom to love and choose their partner unhone 10 janvari, 2011 ko desh ke sabase mahatvapurn madrason main se ek daarul ulum devband kaa mohatamim banane ke turant baad angreji ke ek akhbaar se baatcheet main kaha ki narendra modi ke gujarat main musalamaanon ke liye aarthik avasar hai
 61-year-old Ghulam Mohammad Vastanvi was quoted as saying: Let us go ahead, the riots took place eight years ago and today Muslims are beneficiaries of development in Gujarat
 akhbaar main chape unke is bayaan ko modi kii tarif maan liya gaya or saharanpur main sthit jis madrase ke sansthaapakon ne 1857 main angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat kii thi vahaan ke tulaba (chaatr) or ustaadon ne apane hi mohatamim ke khilaaf baghawat kaa bigul baja diya
 40 Tulaba of Madrasa sat on hunger strike on 24 January, demanding the removal of Mohtamim
 mohatamim ko lekar hangaame main samachar madhyamon ne aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
 The Urdu Times wrote, "the statements of Maulana Vastanvi not only shocked the Muslims, Modi must have been shocked by them as well
 '' aag ke sampadakeey main kaha gayah ''moulana ko bataanaa chahie ki jaghanya aparaadh anjaam dene vaale ko maaf karne kaa adhikaar unhen kisne diya he
 "but Vastanvi's supporters were also not lacking
 islamic vidwaan moulana vahiduddin khan ne kaha, ''unka bayaan muslim samudaay main sakaaratmak soch laane kii disha main ek kadam tha
 Darul Uloom became the center of controversy with anti-vastanvi and pro-statements, which was common to Vastanvi as well as ordinary Muslims
 vastanvi ne 23 farvari ko majalis-e-shura kii baithak main teen maamalon kii jaanch ke liye cameti banaai
 The three issues of the investigation were: to know the reality of the alleged statements in the media about giving clean chit to Modi and the charge of distributing the idols; Campaign of Tulba to remove Mohtamim and find out the masters who instigated him
 lekin is jaanch cameti kii 23 july ko shura main pesh kii gai report adhuri thi
 In it, the issue related to Vastanvi was investigated and the remaining issues were dropped
 santhaan ke samvidhan ko taak par rakhkar voting karai gai or chaar sadasyon ko chhodkar baaki ne unke khilaaf vot diya
 Amada Vastanvi, who did not resign earlier, accepted Shura's decision to "maintain the dignity and prestige of Darul Uloom"
 ''hameshaa aage kii sochane vaale vastanvi kehete hai, '' mujhe vahaan se hataaya janaa gaiyr-aaini (asanvaidhanik) or gaiyr-dasturi tha
 But i will not challenge it in court
 use maine bhula diya he
 In fact, Vastanvi's ordeal began on January 10, when she was selected as Mohtamim
 21 sadasyeey shura ke maujuud 14 sadasyon main unhone jamiyatul ulema-e-hind ke pramukh moulana arshad madani or naayab mohatamim khalik madrasi ko haraaya tha
 The funny thing is that Vastanvi's daughter is married to Madani's son and Madani was his strongest rival
 madani parivaar kaa daarul ulum ke saath lanbaa rishta rahaa he, jo 1930 ke dashak main moulana 'san ahamed madani ke devband kaa mohatamim banane ke samay se he
 For Madani, winning the election was like maintaining the tradition, but he lost to an outsider who had an agenda for change

 Throw away the past emb digridhari moulana ne is sanstha ko 1982 main sthapit kiya tha
 Vastanvi has now reached Jamia Akkalkuan again
 ve kehete hai, ''ab aap jamiya akkalkuan ke bare main baat kiijie
 Jamia's campus has 15,000 children
 iske 10 degree college or saat diploma college hai
 Two lakh children are studying in its various branches across the country

 pichley saal bharat main bade str par atm frod hua
 Millions of cards were blocked and atms upgraded
 lekin abhi bhi atm ke computers me puraane oparating system istemaal main hai
 Malwares targeting atms are not new
 lekin ab ek bada khatra saamne aa rahaa he
 Cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab has found a new malware atmii
 yah milavayer khatranaak he, kyonki ye Windows 7 or Widows Vista vaale atm ko torget kar saktaa he
 Kaspersky's blog states, 'some criminals steal cash by blasting at atms, some blow money in other ways and these include malware attacks
 hamane iske bare main pehle bhi likhaa he or ab is list main Backdoor
 Win32
 atmii nayaa mailaware jud gaya he’gauratlab he ki april 2017 main sabase pehle is milavayer ke bare main pataa chalaa tha
 According to the blog, then Criminals need ATM direct access to use this malware
 diarect acces yani atm ke paas ja kar kisi tarah se mailaware daalana hota he yaa phir atm network ke jariye mailaware inject kiya jaataa he
 If the criminals are successful in doing this, then due to the atmii malware, the entire cache kept in the ATM can be removed
 Kaspersky Lab ke cenier develpar constantin jyacove ne is mailaware ke bare main kaha he ki yah atm ke duusare mailaware ke mukaable thodaa kamjor he
 However, with this small code, big losses can be done in atms and the entire cash of atms can be withdrawn at one go
 Kaspersky ke mutabik is tarah ke atake se bachane ke liye difolt dinai policy or divaais control jaise security megers lene honge
 The first method prevents serializers from running their code in the internal computer of the ATM while the second prevents other devices such as USB sticks from connecting to the machine

 BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratan Rudine said that Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi still needs to learn a lot in politics, although he has been so long in politics that by now he should have learned everything

 He said that Rahul has said that the central government respects everyone, if the central government respects them, then why were lathi charged by police on Baba Ramdev in the midnight at Ramlila Maidan in which a woman was killed
 agar congress izzat hi karti he to phir anna hajaare ko unke ghar se uthaakar giraftaar kyon kiya gaya tha
 i want to ask Congress General Secretary Rahul what is the definition of respect in the eyes of him and his party
 rudi ne kaha, ‘rahul kehete hai ki uttar pradesh main pichley saalon se gundo kaa raaj rahaa he to phir unki party ne uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar ko samarthan kyon kiya tha, yaheen nahi in gundo kii partiyon ke sahyog se hi kendra main 2008 main congress kii sarkaar bachi thi

 '' yah kahana he vasepur ke 24 varshiya ikbaal khan kaa, jo haal hi main jamaanat par chhootakar jail se baahar aae hai
 He is the son of the same Faheem Khan, who is named as Faisal Khan in Anurag's film
 juddin siddiki kii bhoomika main hamaare saamne aata he
 Sardar Khan, played by Manoj Vajpayee in the film, actually says Iqbal, the grandson of Shafiq Khan, "my grandfather was killed by his brother Hanif
" mere walid ne kaatil ko khatm kar diya
 He is in jail for the same charge
 ye sab baaten film main kahin nahin hai
 Iqbal explains that in the case of a woman kidnapped in the first part of the film, Sardar's scene of bullying Ramadhir Singh (inspired by Sooraj Dev Singh's real character and starring Tigmanshu Dhulia) is concocted
 unki thik yahi raay shakespeare kii style vaale montegue-capeulett romance yaa phir parpendicular or definet jaise naamon ke bare main bhi he

 It seems that keeping information about who killed whom, when, should be a matter of pride here

 Prior to 1962, the Central Government had only two collieries with a pay structure while 60-65 private mines with no minimum There was no salary structure

 desh kii satta kaa rasta upi se hokar jaataa he or upi ko jeetne ke liye purvanchal ko jeetna jaruri he
 By this formula, the BJP, which won the maximum seats in UP in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections, is now trying to make inroads in Purvanchal to win the 2019 war
 purvanchal ko saadhane ke lihaaj se pradhanmantrinarendra modi magahar ke baad ab sapa ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ke sansadeey kshetra azamgarh main 14 july ko ek raily karenge
 During this time, Modi will lay the foundation stone of Purvanchal Expressway, the biggest project of the Uttar Pradesh government, but can also announce some new schemes
 bataa den pichley dinon sant kabir nagar ke magahar main piem modi kii jansabha hui thi
 During this time Modi attacked all opposition parties including SP and BSP
 mana ja rahaa he ki is hamale ko azamgarh main ve or aakraamakata de sakate hai
 Azamgarh was the only seat in Purvanchal in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where the BJP could not win
 piem modi hi nahin balki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bhi purvanchal ko saadhane kii koshish main lag gaye hai
 Shah has decided to weave Mission-2019's Tanabana from Vindhyachal Dham in Purvanchal on Wednesday
 ve 4 july ko mirzapur or varanasi pahunch rahe hai
 From here, Shah will meet with the in-charge of the 30 Lok Sabha constituencies of Awadh, Kashi and Gorakhpur provinces and will find the pulse of the organization and the people at the ground level
 gauratlab he ki modi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye upi main vipakshi dal ekajute ho rahe hai
 In the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections of Purvanchal, the BJP was troubled by the unity of the SP-BSP
 iske baad vipaksh kii ekta kii takat kii ajamaish pashchim upi ke kairana main bhi dikhi, jahaan areldi ne bijepi ko shikast di
 Encouraged by the formula of victory in the by-elections, the SP, BSP and Congress are planning to enter the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by forming a grand alliance
 teenon dalon ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar manthan jari he
 It is believed that the coordination of seats between the allies of the Grand Alliance will be based on 2009 to a great extent, because in 2014, the opposition was completely demolished
 2009 ko aadhaar banaaya jayega to teenon hi dalon ke bich jamkar rassakasi hogi, kyonki purvanchal kshetra kii siton ke 2009 ke parinaam par gaur farmaaya jaae to teenon dalon ke bich bahut zyada antar nahin he
 Statistics show that then out of 21, eight seats were won by BSP, 7 by SP and 6 by Congress
 jabaki 2014 kii baat kii jaae to keval sapa ko ek seat mili, wo bhi tab jab khud mulaayam singh azamgarh se maidan main utre
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see how the seats are aligned between the Congress, SP and BSP, who gets how many seats
 2019 main vipaksh mahagathbandhan banaakar utarataa he, to bijepi ke liye 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana aasaan nahin hoga
 If you leave a seat like Varanasi, then most of the seats in Purvanchal will go out of the hands of the BJP
 bijepi ke haathon se purvanchal khiskaa to phir desh kii satta tak pahunchnaa mushkil ho jayega
 It is very important for the BJP to practice Purvanchal under the political temperament instead of UP
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki piem modi or amit shah pashchimi uttar pradesh ke mukaable purvi uttar pradesh par zyada focus kar rahe hai
 bjp's state unit has been trying to make the atmosphere in its favor by holding Modi's rallies in several districts of Purvanchal
 mana ja rahaa he piem kii har maheene upi main ek raily karaane kaa party ne plan banaaya he

 Reservation before the civic elections Given the setbacks in the elections, Congress and Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel do not want to take any risk in the local body elections
 mahaj chaar maheene ke baad chhattisgarh main nagar nikaay chunaav hone hai, jise congress har haal main jitkar apane varchasv ko barkaraar rakhana chaahati he

 Apart from this, the ST community has 32 per cent status
 is tarah se aarakshan kaa kul dayera 58 se badhaakar 72 fisadi kar diya he
 The Supreme Court had reached the matter that about seven years ago, the BJP government led by Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh issued a notification on 18 January 2012, changing the reservation policy
 iske tahat lok seva (essi, asti evam pichhadaa varg kaa aarakshan) adhinium 1994 kii dhara chaar main sanshodhan kiya gaya tha
 Accordingly, it was decided to give 32 percent reservation to Scheduled Tribes, 12 percent to Scheduled Castes and 14 percent to Other Backward Classes
 kul aarakshan 58 fisad tha
 This is more than the 50 percent limit prescribed by the Supreme Court
 iske khilaaf 2012 main hi guru ghasidas sahitya evam samskruti academy raipur, satnam seva sangh raipur, piaar khunte samet anya ne yachikaayen lagaai thim
 The petitions were transferred by the Supreme Court to the Chhattisgarh High Court for hearing

 Modi's upper caste reservation will be shielded, although the Narendra Modi government has broken the 50 percent limit by giving 10% reservation to poor upper castes

 ‪A post shared by Pooja Hegde (@hegdepooja) on Mar 27, 2018 at 11:34pm PDTA post shared by Pooja Hegde (@hegdepooja) on Mar 21, 2018 at 12:41am PDT Iraq is again under the shadow of terror
 iraq ek baar phir khatre main he
 Because the world's most dreaded terrorist organization has started writing such a speech from the slayer that if they succeed in their plan, then understand that the map of the world will change
 jihadiyon kii tukdi teji se aage badhati ja rahi he
 And the fact is that after capturing many cities, those people are now from the capital Baghdad
 
 The bus has reached a distance of a few kilometers
 
 Alam is that this dreadful stir in Iraq has made even the world's most powerful country restless
 khud ko islamic state of iraq and da luvent bulaane vaale sunni vidrohiyon ne iraq main qayaamat dhaani shuru kar di he
 After capturing six Iraqi cities, Sunni rebels have now moved closer to Samara, Iraq's holiest city
 samaara se mahaj 55 kilometre dur sunni vidrohiyon ne ravivaar kii raat deraa daalaa he
 And as their convoy is advancing
 tabaahi or maut ke manjar peeche chhutate ja rahe hai
 The help from Shia and Kurdish fighters has encouraged Iraqi forces
 lihaaja iraqi phujon ne salaahddin or diyaala ke najadik jihadi sena ko rokane kii koshish shuru kar di he
 Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama has made it clear that he has the option to deal with these fighters completely and that he can instruct his army to take air military action anytime
 yahaan tak ki arab kii khadi main vimaan vaahak jahaaz uassoes echdblue bush tainaat bhi kar diya gaya he
 And two more warships have been deployed with it
 lekin america ne ye bhi saaf kiya he ki america sena ko iraq kii dharti par nahin utaara jayega
 On the other hand, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani says that if America takes action in Iraq, then they can also come forward to help
 ye baat kaabile gaur he ki tal afra main khaastaur par taur par sunni or shiya aabaadi he
 Also there are some Turks in it
 alam ye he ki iraq ke saikadon mile dur bharat main pareshaani mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 The Indian government has instructed the Indians present in Iraq to leave immediately and asked the embassy there to make special arrangements for this
 do roj pehle alam ye tha ki vidrohiyon kii sena ek shahar ke baahar sena se muqabla kar rahi thi
 But within two days, Sunni rebels have captured many cities there
 iraq zulm or jang kii vajah se duniya ke sabase charchit mulkon main shumaar ho chukaa he
 It was Iraq, whose self-styled President, Saddam Hussein, never lost his sight in his life
 or to or usne duniya ke sabase taqatvar mulk yani america se loha lekar tabah ho jane se bhi gurej nahin kiya
 But now this new picture of Saddam Hussein in front of the world has shocked the good
 duniya ke kai mulkon ko ab iraq kii haalat par taras aane laga he
 Who is that problem? Because of which the spirits of Iraqis are getting destroyed? After all, what is that bed? Who is that problem? Who has threatened the existence of Iraq as a country? Due to which the Iraqi army has been forced to kneel? Whose voice is making the souls of stubborn Iraqis cry? And due to the arrival of which the soldiers have started taking off the uniform from their chest and running away? So sir, let us also make you angry with this person
 ye shaks koi or nahin, balki ye he duniya ke sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan islamic state of di iraq and da levent yani iesas kaa sirmaur abu bakar al bagdadi
 In other words, it is a person who has now become the biggest name of fear for Iraq as well as all North African countries
 iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne iraq ko kyon gheraa?lekin ab sawaal ye uthta he ki akhir iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne iraq ko is tarah kyon gheraa he? akhir kyon iesas ke khadku iraqi fouj ko gaajar-muuli kii tarah katate hue aage bad rahe hai? or pichley chand dinon main kaise is sanghathan ke aatankwaadiyon ne teen iraqi shahar faluja, tirakit or mosul ko kabje main kabje main le liya he? to in sawaalon ke jawaab bhi kam chaunkaanewaale nahin hai
 In fact, ISIS is a terrorist organization that wants to establish its rule in the name of Islam in many countries, including Iraq, and has now captured a large part of Iraq in an effort
 haalat ye he ki is desh main mache is ghamaasan kii badaulat jahaan 5 lakh log apane hi mulk main beghar hokar sharnaarthi kii zindagi ji rahe hai, vahiin saikadon log apni jaan se haath dho chuke hai
 These terrorists, wrapped in black clothes, put black flags wherever they go
 or iske baad iraq ke shahriyon ke saamne do hi raste bachate hai
 Either accept the enslavement of these black flags or else you lose your life by opposing the terrorists
 halaat ye he ki aatankwaadiyon kii goliyon kaa nishaanaa ban kar iraq main jahaan anginat begunaah apni jaan se haath dho baithe hai, vahiin sarkaar trahimam kar rahi he
 According to current reports, ISIS militants armed with all the latest weapons captured the Iraqi city of Faluja first and then on Tiraqit
 yahaan tak to phir bhi ganimat thi
 But now the extent is that the terrorists have also captured Mosul, Iraq's largest city after Baghdad and 400 kilometers away from Baghdad
 rocket laancharon se hamalaa karte, tinkon se raundte or tabadatod goliyaan barasaate is sanghathan ke aatankwaadi ab ab iraq main failane lage hai
 Due to this, the dead bodies are lying in the midst of death ordeal on the streets of Iraq, as a country, Iraq is constantly weakening
 akhir koun he ye abu bakarduniya ke sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan kaa sargana, duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadiyon kaa aakaa or alqaida ke cheef al javaahari ke baad duniya kaa ye most wanted aatankwaadi abu bakar al bagdadi iraq main apane khoff kii sultanate kaayam karnaa chahta he
 So who is this Abu Bakr? 
 And what is his personality? Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali Badri
 urf abu bakar al bagdadi
 Aka Invisible Sheikh
 urf dow ibrahim
 Name one, person one, identity also one
 lekin tasviren faqat do
 The greatest identity of this most wanted terrorist in the world after Al Qaeda's Chief Al Jawahiri is that he likes to be a poshida
 lekin nakaab ke peeche rah kar bhi is shaks ne ab tak jo qatl-o-gaarat machaai he, uske bare main sun kar rongte khadey ho jate hai
 Yes, this is the person who is accused of being the mastermind of the current havoc perpetrated in Iraq
 duusare lafzon main kahen to ye abu bakar al bagdadi hi he, jisaki rahanumai main iesas ke aatankwaadi iraq ko nestonabud karne main jute hai
 And this is the reason why the US State Department has announced a total reward of US $ 10 million to the person who gave the living or dead address of this person
 ye rakam al javaahari ke sir par rakhi gaye america inaam yani 25 million yues dollar ke baad duusari sabase badi rakam he
 Although the stories of Abu Bakr al-baghdadi's quintessence are long, but this time the way he has held half of Iraq hostage is his biggest bet ever
 sabase badi luutye abu bakar al bagdadi hi he, jisaki aguwai main iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne naa sirf iraq ke duusare bade shahar mosul ko apane kabje main kar liya, balki isi silsile main mosul ke central bank ko lut kar is duniya kii sabade badi bank lut kaa itihaas bhi apane naam kar liya
 Wouldn't you like to know how much Baghdadi and its henchmen spent in this loot? so listen
 ye rakam thi 500 billian iraqi dinar yani takreeban 25 sau karod rupye kii
 Baghdadi has been the owner of Osama bin Laden On 16 May 2010, as the head of ISIS, Baghdadi, who commanded this world's richest terrorist organization, has already been the commander of Al Qaeda commander Osama bin Laden
 logon ko yaad he ki kis tarah laden kii maut ke baad usne naa sirf iskaa badla lene kii baat kahi thi, balki iraq samet tamaam levent mulkon yani cyprus, isroyal, jordan, lebanon, syria, philistin or turki ko milakar ek islamic mulk banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 But his intention would be broken every single day on Iraq so much that even Iraq itself did not know
 lekin iraq par kabja karne ke iraade se katle-aam machaa rahaa bagdadi apni target main naa sirf bahut aage nikal chukaa he, balki iraq ke saath-saath puri duniya ke liye ek saradard sabit hone laga he
 Invisible Sheikh Has Been Named This Is America's Fear Or Way Out Of Leak, Despite Working Years With Osama bin Laden and Al Jawahiri, Al Baghdadi Has Never Released Any Video Of His Own And No Have ever come in front of the camera
 yahaan tak kii khud uske sanghathan ke kai bade cmanderon ne bhi apane is aakaa ko kabhi aamane-saamne nahin dekha he or tabhi iskaa naam invizible shaikh pad chukaa he
 Iraq once again stands at the mouth of the war
 islamic state in iraq and da levent ke aatankwaadi ne
 
 iraqi sarkaar ke khilaaf baghawat kaa bigul phoonk diya he
 In such
 
 Today, Iraq's biggest supporter America has made it clear that if necessary
 
 So he can jump into the battlefield
 to kya phir se jang ke muhane par he iraq?to kya phir se iraq main shuru hoga faujee ghamaasan?to kya phir se america fuj hogi iraq main daakhil?yaa phir iesas ho jaayegaa apane iraade main kaamyaab?ek-ek kar teen iraqi shaharon par duniya ke sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas ke kabje ke saath hi ye sawaal ek baar phir se fijaa main tairne lage hai
 On the one hand, while ISIS is steadily strengthening its grip on the whole of Iraq, the United Nations and many friendly countries, including the US, have expressed their concern over the new situation there
 puri duniya ke saamne ab do hi raste handrasal, islamic state in iraq and da levent naam ke is aatankwaadi sanghathan ne iraq samet duusare kai deshon ko milakar jo nae islamic mulk kaa sapana buna he, wo lakhon begunaahon ke koon-kharabe se hokar guzarataa he or ab iraq ke teen shaharon par kabje ke saath isaki shuruyaat ho chuki he
 In such a situation, now there are only two paths in front of the whole world
 awwal to chupchaap iesas ko manamaani karte hue dekhnaa yaa phir doosraa iesas ko rokane ke liye iraq main hi unki gherebandi karnaa
 And so far, the signs that US President Barack Obama has given, only point towards another option
 darasal, obama ne iesas se bhidane ke vikalpon par vichaar karne kii baat kahi he
 And in his remarks, the fate of the coming days of Iraq is hidden
 haalat ye he ki obama ke bayaan ke baad white house ke pravaktaa ne bhi unki baton ko aage badhaayaa he
 While the White House has said that the US government can carry out airstrikes on insurgents in Iraq, the UN Security Council says that the UN is with the government and the people there in the fight against Iraq
 aise main takaraav ke halaat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The worst losers are the condition of the people in Koirak is constantly worsening
 faluja, tikrit or mosul par kabje ke baad ab aatankwaadiyon ne iraq kii rajdhani baghdad kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya he
 And unfortunately these are the areas where these terrorists hate the largest population living
 upar se in aatankwaadiyon ke mukaable ke liye iraqi fouj ne khud apane hi mulk main hawaii hamale karne ko majaboor he
 And in all of these, the common people are suffering the most
 tel ke shahar kirkuk par kabjaudhar, haalat ye he ki iraq ke uttar main ek or dhade yani kurd faujon ne pehle hi tel ke shahar kirkuk par kabja kar liya he
 They claim that government forces have fled from there
 jabaki iesas kaa dayera lagaataar bad rahaa he
 In such a situation, the experts believe that if the rebel's occupation of the oil production base continues to increase, then the coming days will not only ignite the price of crude oil, but it will also reach the other countries of the world away from Iraq
 
 abhi tak loksabhaa chunaavon (loksabha Elections) kaa silsilaa samaapt hone main abhi der he lekin pashchim bengal (west Bengal) kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ne somvaar ko us uttar pradesh (UP) ke liye ek bhavishyavaanee kar di he, jahaan centre kii satta par kabiz hone kii ummid kar rahi kisi bhi party ke liye acha pradarshan ati aavashyak he
 Regarding BJP, Mamata Banerjee told ndtv's Prannoy Roy that "she is losing" and she will not get 17 out of 80 seats in the state
 unhone kaha ki ''congress (congress) ko saat se aath siten milengi or mayawati (mayawati) or akhilesh (akhilesh Yadav) kaa pradarshan behtareen hoga
 In the 2014 elections, the BJP won 70 seats in the state with the highest number of seats in Uttar Pradesh and its ally Apna Dal won two seats
 isse bijepi ko aasaani se loksabhaa main bahumat hasil ho gaya
 It was the first time in three decades that a single party had won an absolute majority
 mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ne kaha ki kshetreey dalon ke bich saamanjasy bahut he, or aage kii yojanaon ke liye unki baatcheet aage bad rahi he
 When asked about the opposition being called "khichdi" by Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi), he questioned, "what is wrong with being a khichdi?" You can also have rice, lentils or potato vegetable, it is put together in khichdi
 "pradhanmantri modi (PM Narendra Modi) par raajnneetik bhaashan ke str ko giraane kaa aarope lagaate hue mamata (mamata Banerjee) ne kaha, "apni bhashaa mat bolo
 They should know that they are pms and when they are talking, people are listening
 raajnneetik bhaashan bhi samskruti kaa hissaa he
 i would call a goon a goon, but i don't talk like that
 ''jab mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) se anya pradhanmantriyon kii tulana main piem modi (PM Narendra Modi) kaa akalan karne ke liye kaha gaya to unhone kaha "main unki koi reating nahin kar sakati
 
 
 They have become worse than fascists
 " unhone kaha ki "ve bengal main jo kar rahe hai vah apatkaal se zyada he
 They are running everything
 sabhi adhikari chunaav ayog ke adheen hai
 "chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that the BJP is running a parallel government and everywhere they are spending huge money
 mamata ne haal hi main aarope lagaaya tha ki chunaav ayog ne centre main sattarudh bijepi ke ishaare par chaar police adhikariyon ke sthanantaran kaa aadesh diya tha
 The commission had dismissed the allegation and said that its decision was based on the feedback received from a senior officer and special police supervisor
 ayog ne mamata banerjee ko yah bhi bataaya tha ki chunaav kanoon ke anusaar, model code ke dauraan adhikariyon ko sthanantarit karne or niyukt karne ke liye uske apane adhikaar hai jinke tahat vah kaam kar rahaa he
 The war of words between Mamata Banerjee and Prime Minister Modi (PM Narendra Modi) over the bjp's goal of securing 23 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal today
 piem modi ne daawa kiya he ki mamata ke 40 vidhayak unke sampark main hai or loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit hote hi mamata kaa saath chhod denge
 Trinamool Congress, the party of Mamata Banerjee, has accused Modi of horse trading and lodged a complaint with the Election Commission
 party ke varisht netaa derek o bryan ne twit kiya, expyri babu piem, sidhi tarah samaj len
 Nobody will go with you
 ek counslar bhi nahin
 You are campaigning or horse trading! Your expiry date is near
 aap par horse trading ke aarope ko lekar aaj ham chunaav ayog se shikaayat kar rahe hai
 "the Trinamool leader later said in a tweet," a complaint has been lodged in the ECI against Modi for horse trading
 enarasi par nitish kumaar ke bayaan se sakate main vipakshi dalanitish kumaar kaa hameshaa dohare charitra vaala ection rahaa he: rjdrartriya naagarik register (enarasi) ko lekar jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ke aae bayaan se vipakshi dal sakate main he
 Till recently, JDU spokesperson has been making statements about NRC not being implemented in Bihar, but now Nitish Kumar said that it is under discussion within the party
 party kisi nattejey par pahonchegi uske baad hi stand clear hoga
 There was a lot of uproar in the Bihar Assembly over JDU and especially Nitish Kumar's stand on NRC
 ab vipakshi dalon kaa maananaa he ki nitish kumaar compromij karne ke mood main hai
 'nitish Kumar's double character action' RJD spokesperson and MLA Ramanujaka says, "nitish Kumar has always been a double character action, he speaks and does something, compromises for the chair
 nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki kisi bhi haalat main 370, teen talaak jaise mudde ko ham nahin maanenge jo hamaara kaaman minimum program main nahin rahaa he, lekin sabko inhone mana
 'he said,' If but about NRC, this is his maneuver
 isko main pintara baaji shabd kaa prayog karuunga anyathaa yah raishumaari karenge
 Who is speaking on this subject in his team, it is absolutely surrender
 modi effect in par lagu he
 Surely these people have been opposing before and then supporting
 nitish ji har ishu par sarender karte rahe hai, yah kursi kumaar hai, kursi ke liye kisi bhi tarah kaa compromij karenge
 Shakeel Ahmed Khan of Congress said, "actually, Nitish Kumar and the Janata Dal u are the whole party going through contradiction and contradiction
" pehle ye enarasi kaa virodh karte hai or phir vahiin par satak seetaram, lekin sawaal yah he ki aapako to clearty to rakhni padegi
 The treatment that the BJP has done with the Janata Dal u should not be read by them, but still they are not talking about support nor talking about Mukhlfat, they will vote
 'gauratlab he ki bijepi lagaataar bihar main enarasi lagu karne kii baat karti rahi he, aise main nitish kumaar ke is bayaan ke baad enarasi par abhi party main baat chal rahi he
 Opposition parties are clear that they will also reach the end of this issue like triple talaq and Section 370
 dhara 370 ke maamle main jediu pehle hi spasht kar chuki he ki is maamle main kanoon ban chukaa he to uskaa paalan to karnaa padegaa
 If the central government imposes a law on NRC too, then the Bihar government will have to agree

 ab mahagathbandhan ke dal apni aapasi kadavaahaton or mahatvakankshaon ko bhulaakar ek saath aa sakate hai yaa nahin, yah to bhavishya ke garbh main he, lekin jate hue saal ne itnaa spasht kar diya he ki yadi ve ek saath aa gaye, to BJP, or uske saath-saath rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan, yani NDA kii museebataan bad sakati hai
 
 
 In fact, in the passing year, a total of 13 Lok Sabha seats were held, of which nine seats were held by the BJP in 2014, and seven lost

 Seeing this, Durga ji produced Kalratri with her glory

 We can speak two-four things in anger but will not harm anyone
 ham karenge to unka hit hi karenge par unhen bhadkaaie mat
 Nitish said that we never said that we will not increase the salary of teachers
 ham isaki samiksha kar rahe hai jo bhi sambhav hoga karenge
 Nitish said that the opposition kept on saying that his magic had gone down but he should remember that he had a crushing defeat in the Bihar assembly elections and the same will happen in the next Lok Sabha election

 samudr main pile rang kii peeth vaali lakhon fuzelrs (choti machhlee) kaa jhund hamaare irdagird aa gaya
 Suddenly a whitetip reef shark appeared from behind
 use dekhte hi choti machhliyon kaa jhund alag-alag dishaao main teetar-bitar ho gaya
 We needed to go faster and lower to avoid the rapid flow of the stream
 hamane jab tal kii taraf dekha to paaya ki ek vishalkay bul re ret main dhansa tha
 We moved towards him, for the first time we saw a tiger shark in this sea
 10 foot lambii vah maadaa shark sidhe hamaari ore aane lagi or ham ghabara gaye, maano hamaare liye tairnaa dubhar ho gaya ho
 The moment seemed endless to us
 shark ke sharir par bani dhaariyaan kisi godane kii tarah lag rahi thim
 Suddenly she turned to the other side, as if she was not interested in us
 behad khubasurat or manamaujee maadaa shark badi shaan se pani main gaayab ho gai
 What else could have been a better experience? The author is a filmmaker and certified dive instructor

 It is worth noting that Advani had recently said in an interview to 'the Indian Express' that India's political system is still not ready to deal with the emergency situation and did not rule out the possibility of such suspension of civil rights in future also

 The last hearing of the Ayodhya case in the Supreme Court, Nirmohi Akhada, the protest of Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas is to end at 5 pm on Thursday
 buudhvaar ko is sunwaayee kaa antim din he or sabhi pakshakaar tay samaysima main apni baat rakh rahe hai
 During the hearing there came a time when Hindu parties started opposing each other
 adaalat main buudhvaar ko nirmohi akhaada kii taraf se ramajnmabhumi nyaas kii daleelon kaa virodh kiya gaya
 In fact, Sushil Jain, advocate of Nirmohi Akhara, opposed the argument of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and said why did he (ramjanmabhoomi Nyas) say that Babur demolished the temple and built a mosque
 hamane hameshaa kaha he ki wo mandir hi tha
 We never gave land rights to Muslims
 nirmohi akhaada kii ore se susheel jain ne kaha ki unhone 1961 kaa ek nakshaa dikhaaya, jo galat tha
 He filed suit without any evidence
 vahaan kii imaarat hameshaa se hi mandir thi
 There is no evidence that the mosque was built by Babur
 isapar justise ashok bhushan ne kaha ki jo suut daayar kiya gaya he vah tital kaa he, isamen acces kii koi baat nahin he
 Nirmohi Akhara vs
 Nirvani Akhara has come before Nirmani Akhara and Nirmani Akhara before Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas
 buudhvaar ko hi sunwaayee ke dauraan nirvaani akhaada ne daawa kiya ki ramalala janmasthan par seva kaa adhikaar unka he, aise main unhen ye hi adhikaar milanaa chahie
 On this, Justice Bhushan said that but the Allahabad High Court has considered the Nirmohi Arena as a service
 isapar nirvaani akhaada ke vakil jayadeep gupta ne kaha ki wo daawa galat he
 It was said on their behalf that we are the only service contender
 jab vahaan resiver niyukt kiye gaye tab bhi hamaara akhaada hi seva, shobhaayatra or utsav kaa aayojan or dekharekh karata tha, lekin baad main hamen baahar kar diya
 It is said that no work is impossible if it is encouraging
 aisi hi ek safalataa kii kahani he ujjain ke ek teacher kii
 An example of what a teacher can do for his students and how much matters is given by Dinesh Kumar Jain, a resident of Ujjain and a teacher in a government school
 bhikhaari ko mila litrace aword, garib bacchiyon kii khatir maangata he bheekhujjain ke lasudiya chuvad gaanv main chaar saal tak ek kiraye ke kamare main bacchon ko padhaane vaale dinesh kumaar jain ne aakhirkaar apane chaatro kii padhai ke liye ek chat kii ladaai jeet hi lee
 In fact, the roof of the government school in which Dinesh Kumar taught was broken, for which Dinesh Kumar wrote 12 times to the Education Department for repair
 shaabaash! IIT kanpur ke teen chaatro ne forbs top 30 main banaai jagahkhat par sangyaan to nahin liya gaya, par building kii khasta haalat ko dekhte hue skool sil kar diya gaya
 The study of all the students studying there was in danger
 aise main dinesh 6 saal tak nai building kii maang karte rahe
 Distressed by his demand, the department transferred him
 haalanki dinesh ne apni jagah to nahin badali, par wo iske liye hoicourt pahunch gaye
 Transfer canceled
 ab dinesh ek kiraye ke ghar main bacchon ko padhaate hai
 You would not know about Chahal who took 6 wickets
 
 
 unki koshishon kaa hi nateeja he ki ab department ne nae anganbari centre main yah skool chalaane kaa faisla liya he
 Politics is probably the art of possibilities
 aakhir mumbai ke hayaat hotel main 25 november ko jo kuch hua, use or kaise samajha ja saktaa he
 56 Shiv Sena mlas took oath of allegiance to their president Uddhav Thackeray besides Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi
 maheene bhar pehle tak, shivasena kii raajnneeti rakanpa or congress ke khilaaf tikhe virodh ke ird-gird gumti thi, or aksar in partiyon ke pramukhon par vyaktigat tikaa-tippanee tak pahunch jaati thi
 In such a situation, this incredible event shown on TV was certainly a wonder of the political skills, dedication and networking of the old Mahabali Pawar of Maharashtra politics
 21 aktubar ko maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle rakanpa ke saat vidhayak shivasena or bhaajapa main chale gaye the
 Then in a conversation with India Today on October 6, 79-year-old Pawar said, "this is a good opportunity for me to rebuild the party with young leaders
" '' rakanpa kaa manobal gira hua tha or is mushkil ghadi main pavaar ke kai dost party ko dhan dene se hichak rahe the
 This made the situation very difficult that the BJP, especially Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, prepared the election election with the slogan 'me Punha Ye (I will come again)'
 8 aktubar ko pavaar ne rajyavyapee daura shuru kiya
 He addressed 57 rallies for the next ten days and traveled an average of 300 km every day
 manch par unka andaaj badla hua tha—body language nai thi or bhaashan tikhe or chutile ho gaye the
 In a meeting, Pawar asked whether those who left NCP had worn bangles while in power for 15 years
 satara main, barish main bheed ko sambodhit karte unki tasviren chhapin
 At another rally, he mimicked a eunuch to tell that rival parties do not have the strength to compete with him
 unhone kaha, ''aata he mala shikaavnar (ve mujhe sikhaane chale hai)
 Pawar's state-wide tour sparked election campaign and brought him back to the center of Maharashtra's politics
 pavaar or rakanpa main josh maharashtra rajya sahakaari bank ghotaale main pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ke maamla darj karne se bhi badha
 He called a press conference on 25 September and announced that he would appear before the ED himself two days later
 maratha gaurav kaa aahvaan karte hue, unhone narendra modi sarkaar kii tulana mughal sultanate se kii or ''dilli darbar ke aage ghutane nahin techne'' kii kasam khai
 Later, Pawar tweeted that he would go to the ED Daktar alone
 yah unke samarthakon ko vahaan jutane kaa paroksh sandesh tha
 Senior police officers in Mumbai requested Pawar not to come to the ED office in Mumbai as it could lead to law and order problems
 tabhi maharashtra se bhaajapa ke ek saansad ne idi ke saman ke bare main kaha tha, ''hamaari party ne sharad pavaar ko nayaa jivan de diya he
 It will be heavy
 ''maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav parinaamon ne spasht kar diya ki pavaar ne baadhaon ko na sirf paar kiya balki use apane liye avasaron main badal diya or rajnatik rup se majboot hue
 NCP won 54 seats in this assembly election, 13 more than in 2014
 tis par party ne 2014 main 250 ke mukaable is baar sirf 117 siton par hi chunaav ladaa tha
 ncp's vote share was second
 yah pavaar kii strike rate or unke chunaav abhiyaan ko mili samarthan kaa sanket tha
 Convincing the Congress to join the Shiv Sena-led government under the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance was also a big challenge for Pawar
 kai baadhaaen thim: sonia kaa pavaar ke prati avishvaas, hindutvvaadi party ke saath gathbandhan karne ke bare main congress ke bheetar asamanjas or satta kii saajheedaari ke sarvaswikaarya formule kii jarurat
 Some Congress leaders were skeptical that the alliance would damage the party in northern India — particularly in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi as the Shiv Sena is seen as an anti-migrant party
 naam na chhapane kii shart par congress ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''yah badi bhul he
 The NCP has little to lose, but what will we tell our voters? How are we different from BJP? This (alliance) has dropped our previous political credentials
 ''ek varisht muslim netaa sahit kai congressiyon ne sonia ko pavaar kii baat maanane kii salaah di, jo satta kii saajhedaari main congress ko uchit hissedari dene ke liye shivasena ke saath baatcheet ko taiyaar the
 Sonia also succumbed to the Maharashtra unit of the Congress stating a lack of funds to run the party as the lack of funds could have wiped out the party in the state due to being away from power for five years
 ek congressi netaa bataate hai ki in sab baton ke baavjood sonia or unki team ne is baatcheet kii gati ko dhimaa rakhaa kyonki is saude ke saath bahut kuch daanv par laganaa tha
 Also, given the experience of the coalition in Karnataka, the party was wary of dealing with another 'uncomfortable' ally
 pavaar ke saath lambii khinch rahi charchaaon ne bhaajapa ko rakanpa netaa ajit pavaar ko saadhane kaa mauka de diya
 An NCP insider says that Sharad Pawar was shaken by the nephew Ajit Pawar's rebellion
 23 november ko subah-subah bhaajapa ke netritv vaali sarkaar ke ascharyajanak rup se shapathgrahan main devendra fadavis ke dipti ke rup main ajit ne shapath lee thi
 Pawar came to know about the move when NCP MLA Rajendra Shingne called him at 6 am and told that he was going to Raj Bhavan with Ajit
 pavaar ne party ke varisht netaaon jayant patil, chagan bhujabal or dilip walse-patil ko 15 baagiyon ko party main vaapasi ke liye manaane kii jimmedaari saunpi
 And removed Ajit from the post of NCP Legislature Party leader
 soshal media main afvaahen udaye lageen ki ajit ko khud sharad pavaar ne bhaajapa main bheja he
 Pawar joined the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Congress state president Balasaheb Thorat to handle the situation
 ve rakanpa ke sabhi vidrohiyon kaa pataa lagane main kaamyaab rahe or unhen bandra ke ek paanch sitara hotel main rakhaa gaya
 Not only this, Pawar also asked all mlas of Vikas Aghadi to take oath that they would remain loyal to their party, which was something unusual
 rakanpa ke mumbai adhyaksh nawab malik kehete hai, ''pavaar ne asambhav ko sambhav bana diya
 Pawar announced that he would assure that no MLA is disqualified and the situation came under control
 yakeenan koi master ranneetikaar hi aisa sambhav karke dikhaa saktaa tha
 There is also speculation that Pawar could claim equal status from Shiv Sena for his party's chief minister's post, so why agree to hand over the post of chief minister to Shiv Sena for a full five years? An NCP leader says that Pawar wants to get important ministries like home, finance and water resources in the coalition government, so he has done so
 netaa yaad dilaate hai ki pavaar ne 2004 main bhi mukhyamantri pad kaa daawa chhod diya tha, jabaki rakanpa ne congress se do siten adhik (71) jiti thim
 At the NCP meeting in Pune on 17 November, Pawar's close aides Praful Patel, Sunil Tatkare and Dhananjay Munde supported Ajit's idea of supporting the BJP
 shaayad, apni party ke bhavishya or desh kii raajnneeti kii apni duuradrushti se pavaar ne party netaaon kaa yah suzav khaarij kar diya
 The bjp's record of allies has not been encouraging
 congress netritv sankat se jujh rahaa he or mamata banerjee, mayawati or akhilesh yadav jaise vipakshi netaa apni jameen bachaae rakhane ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai, aise main pavaar ne maharashtra ke rajnatik sankat ko aise vipakshi netaa ke rup main ubharne ke avasar ke rup main dekha he, jo narendra modi-amit shah kii jodi ko unke hi apane khel main maat de saktaa he
 Bringing together the two most incompatible allies, he has established himself as a new strategist to unite the anti-bjp forces
 isamen do raay nahin ki hataash-niraash vipaksh ko jis uddharak kii talash thi, shaayad pavaar ke rup main uski talash puri hoti he

 Also, the Center has said in the court that the guilty do not deserve mercy

 The meeting in the Upper House was interrupted several times for the last two days due to opposition from parties like SP, RJD and LJP, despite the support of opposition NDA and Left parties on the bill related to women reservation
 sapa, rajd or lojpa ke virodh ke chalate samprag sarkaar kaa antarrashtriya mahila diwas ke maukey par yah vidheyak paarit karwaane kaa sapana puraa nahin ho sakaa
 In the Upper House on Monday, those opposing this bill created a ruckus by following the valid parliamentary rules and snatched the paper from the Speaker's desk

 com / qqv78vd8ip Before a rogue can kidnap someone, he should invite a party and send an air ticket to come to him, does this ever happen? But this story of kidnapping extending from Delhi to Patna is similar to this
 is ajeeb vaakye main apharan karanevaalon ne pehle apane shikaar ko 200 karod kii ek bijness deal kii baat kahi or phir iske liye baqayada flite kaa tikat ghar bhijwa diya lekin jaise hi do bhai ye deal karne patna pahunche, airport se hi unka apharan ho gaya
 After being freed from the clutches of the Kidnappers, these two are undoubtedly celebrating their lives but till a few hours before now, these two brothers did not even know whether they would survive or not
 darasal, dilli ke ye do kaarobaari bhai dilli se lekar patna tak faile kidanapers ke ek aise giroh ke hathe chadh gaye the, jo karodon kii deal kaa jhansa dekar aksar logon ko agava kar unase vasuuli kiya karte the
 But this time the bet for these miscreants backfired
 sau se zyada pulisavaalon ne das ghante tak das kilometre ghaney jangalon ke andar kidanapers ke khilaaf aisa abhiyaan chalaaya ki na sirf donon bhai sahi-salaamat baraamad kar liye gaye, balki gang ke paanch badmaash bhi dhar daboche gaye
 Kidnappers had sent Air Ticket to these two contractual brothers living in Badarpur, Delhi, a phone call from an anonymous person in the name of getting the job of marble
 phone karne vaala shaks bataata he ki marble kaa ye kaam puure do sau karod rupye kaa he lekin isse deal ko final karne se pehle unke liye ek baar patna aakar site kaa muyna karnaa behad jaruri he
 Apparently the deal is big, the caller shows his tendency to work and also gives him an air ticket to Patna and in the next few hours, a travel agent will take a flight from Patna to the house of these two business brothers
 Ticket delivers
 filmi andaaj main kiya agavaadilli kii aijiai airport se chal kar go air kii flite jaise hi patna ke jaiprakash narayan airport par pahunchati he, donon bhaaiyon ko bilkul filmi andaaj main agava kar liya jaataa he
 Even then, both of them do not suspect themselves to be kidnapped as the abductees talk to them on the phone and send them to the airport and take them to the hotel, but once in the car with these two brothers Whatever happens, it is beyond dreams for them
 police ke phool gaye haath paanvathodi hi dur chal kar gaadi main maujuud log hathiyaaron ke dam par donon ko bandhak bana lete hai or bataate hai ki ab unki rihaai kii keemat he puure 4 karod rupye
 When the news of the kidnapping of the two business brothers reached the Patna Police, even the uniformed people were swollen
 maamla jitna hai profile tha, utana hi ajeeb kyonki badmaashon ne apane shikaar ko baqayada daavat dekar bihar bulaayaa tha or tab ek saath sau se zyada pulisavaalon ne shuru kiya oparation kidnaping
 The family took the help of the police, after kidnapping, as soon as the families of these two brothers got a call in Delhi to pay a ransom of Rs 4 crore for release, the whole family was shocked
 sawaal do-do jawan beton kii jindagi kaa tha lekin phiroti kii rakam itani badi thi ki soch kar bhi sabko paseene aa rahe the
 In such a situation, the family members decided to seek the help of the police
 apane do bete suresh or kapil kii talash main unke pita babulal sharma bhaage-bhaage patna pahunche or unhone vahiin airport thane main report likhavai
 The team formed for the investigation but when the police heard the story of kidnapping and the way the two boys were abducted, they also lost their ears
 maamla behad ajeeb tha
 Where the kidnappers had told their victim to give a deal of two hundred crore rupees by giving air tickets and then kidnapped
 ab fouran police ne puure bihar main apane mukhabiron kaa jaal bicha diya
 Old miscreants began to be monitored
 saath hi donon bhaaiyon ke mobile phone servilans par lekar unka lokation pataa karne kii shuruyaat hui or is kaam main special oparation group, do jilon kii police, anti rangadari team or siarpief tak ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The police caught the location after this, passed every day one by one and finally the time came when the location of the brothers kidnapped due to intelligence information and technical surveillance came to know
 or ye lokation tha patna se kuch kilometre dur lakhisarai jile kaa shringirishi ilaake ke jangal se
 But as dense as this forest was, it was equally dangerous to go here due to the presence of Naxalites, but if these two brothers of Delhi were to be freed, then it was very important for the police to go here
 or tab raaton-raat is jangal main dhaava bolne kii taiyaari hui
 Bada Lavajama, through the 10-km-long route, reached the spot right inside the forest, where the two abducted brothers were held hostage and then an operation which overturned the whole story
 police ne dhund nikaala bhaaiyon kaa thikanath tiimon main bante sau se zyada pulisavaale puure das ghante tak ghupp andhere main lakhisarai ke jangalon kii khaak chaante rahe
 a forest in which the threat of wild animals was as much as that of Naxalites and land mines at every step
 lekin iske baavjood police aakhirkaar us thikaane tak pahunch hi gai, jahaan dilli se bulaakar agava kiye gaye do bhaaiyon ko rakhaa gaya tha or phir to itani goliyaan chalin ki raat ke andhere main puraa jangal gunj uthaa
 There was no way to get the abducted brothers anywhere else to reach the Europeans, in such a situation, more than a hundred people, divided into eight teams of police, led by Patna SSP Manu Maharaj, roamed the rogues
 Decided to reach the airport
 oobad-khabad or junglee raaston se hote hue safar kii shuruyaat hui or jab police badmaashon ke bilkul kareeb pahunchi, tab raat ke kareeb gyaarah baj rahe the
 Here the police waited for the right opportunity, but by then the miscreants had come to know about the police's arrival and now they were preparing to change the place once again by making the two brothers unconscious again, but on the occasion, the police surrounded them
 iske baad to donon ore se takreeban chalis round goliyaan chalin or aakhirkaar das ghante ke is oparation ke baad police ne donon bhaaiyon ko sahi-salaamat aaazaad karvaa liya
 Shocked to learn about the mastermind, the police mission was successful
 saath hi kidnaping ke shikaar bhaaiyon ko pakad kar baithe kuch gurgon ke saath ek-ek kar paanch log giraftaar kiye ja chuke the
 But the mask of the mastermint of this story was yet to be removed
 or phir jab nakaab hataa, to log dekhte rah gaye
 Because this face was the famous name of Bihar's crook and kidnapping industry - Ranjit Mandal aka Ranjit Dawn
 pehle bhi isi tarah kiya tha aparaapane shikaar ko karodon kii bijness deal ke bahaane or air tikat dekar bulawaane vaale kidanapers ke is gang kii modes oprendi yani kaam karne ke taur tareeke se hi police ko unke bare main ek ahm klu diya
 Because some time ago another businessman from Haryana was also kidnapped in Patna in the same manner and behind this method of kidnapping was the dreaded gangster of Bihar and Ranjit Mandal alias Ranjit Don, an old player in the world of crime
 ab bhi faraar he bihar kaa gangsterji haa, vahi ranjit don, jis par bihar samet kai rajyon main balaatkaar se lekar apharan or rangadari vasuuli se lekar katl tak ke do darjan se zyada maamle darj hai
 The police had now also found out about Ranjit's whereabouts
 or is tarah tamaam tareekon se aakhirkaar wo kidanap kiye gaye bhaaiyon tak bhi pahunch gai lekin is maamle kaa mastermind ranjit ab bhi faraar he
 Ranjit is waiting to be caught If the sources are to be believed, Ranjit is the old face of Bihar's kidnapping industry, which similarly traps its victims
 unase khud ko vasuuli karata hi he, shikaar ko aage duusare badmaashon ko bhi bech detaa he or sirf isi iraade se wo dilli main marble kaa kaam bhi karata rahaa he
 Here, the Delhi Police has now arrested the travel agent who also gave the flight tickets to the contracting brothers at Ranjit's behest
 jaahir he, ab puraa maamla shishe kii tarah saaf he
 The police are waiting for Ranjit to be caught

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray criticized social workers Anna Hazare's associates Kiran Bedi, Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, calling them a 'group of meaningless and mean people'

 He is deeply disappointed by the lewd comments on bold pictures of Bollywood actress Pooja Bedi's daughter Alia
 iske baad aalia ne apana gussa apane blog ke jariye jaahir kiya or un hetars ko karaara jawaab diya
 Alia, daughter of the hot and bold actress Pooja Bedi of her time, has recently turned 18, and she is planning to enter Bollywood
 in dinon aalia apni kuch bold tasveeron ke kaaran charchaa main hai
 Alia is very upset with the comments on these pictures, and she has written a blog opposing these comments
 aalia nen apane blog main likhaa he ki mereclivejadikhane kaa matlab yah nahin ki main aapako kuch bhi kehane kii aazaadee de rahi hum
 Apart from my breast, i am a lot and it is wrong to form opinions about me
 main 18 saal kii ek bhartiya ladki hum or mujhe apni pasand se kapade pahane kii ijaajat bhi he
 Aaliya started her blog with a poem that with a few lines - you can hurt me with your words, rip me off your eyes, kill me with your hatred, but still, like the wind, i Will keep getting up '
 aalia keybold tasvirankuch websiton par share hone ke baad viral ho gai thim, jiske baad wo tasviren bahes kaa mudda bhi ban gayi
 In such a situation, some people made lewd comments on Aaliya's photos, it was surprising that most of the criticized comments came from women
 mahilaon ke caments ke lekar aalia ne blog main likhaa he ki ham kisi mahilaayein hai jo ek-duusare ko shashakt bhi nahin kar saktin
 If we comment on a woman's choice and way of living, then we give consent to the sexualization of women
 aap apni betiyon ko ye padhaa rahi hai ki aapaki keemat utani hi he jitne kapade aapke sharir par hai
 Because of these pictures, Pooja Bedi's daughter was called a 'prostitute'
