 yah saal tha 1983
 The young Mamata Banerjee was learning politics
 isi dauraan kolkata main congress kaa adhiveshan bulaayaa gaya
 When Congress returned to power after the Emergency, Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi was made the General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) and the party's leader Kamalapati Tripathi was given the responsibility of executive secretary
 kolkata kaa adhiveshan isi nae netritv kii aguwai main ho rahaa tha
 During the session, 28-year-old Mamata Banerjee was placed in the team of senior leader Subrata Banerjee and was given the responsibility of looking after the big leaders of the Congress
 mamata banerjee or anya kaaryakarta netaaon kii dekharekh main jute the, is bich party kamalapati treepathi ko lekar pench funs gaya
 Actually, Kamalapati Tripathi had his own beliefs and was adamant on it
 in manyataon main se ek tha ki ve sirf bramhan ke haath kaa bana khaanaa hi khate the
 On the evening of the session, Subrata Da told Mamta Banerjee that Kamalapati Tripathi would only make a handmade meal of a Brahmin woman and in the morning she would need pistachio, dry grapes and juice
 mamata banerjeene subrat da ke nirdeshon ko jas kaa tas anima chatarji ke saamne rakh diya, jo khanpan kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahi thim
 Since there were hundreds of people at the convention, Anima was busy
 unhone mamata se kaha ki mujhe madad ke liye do logon kii jarurat padegi
 Here, something else was going on in Mamata Banerjee's mind
 unhone kamalapati treepathi (kamalapati Tripathi) kii manyataon ko chunauti dene kii thaan lee thi
 In her book, "didi: a Political Biography", Monobina Gupta writes, "mamta Banerjee turned to Anima and said okay
" 
 
 
 My two non-brahmin colleagues will cook food for Kamalapati Tripathi and serve you '
 mamata banerjee ne kiya bhi aisa hi
 Nobody thought about Kanokan
 is vaakye par mamata banerjee apni aatmakatha ''stregals of agjistence'' main likhti hai, 'ab kamalapati treepathi is duniya main nahin hai
 If they had been alive and this incident would have been known, i would have shown a firm exit
 bakaul monobina gupta, mamata banerjee shuru se hi 'puraani manyataon' ko chunauti detii rahi hai
 And as Mamata Banerjee's feet were found in the political corridors, she stood firm and firm
 mamata banerjee(mamata Banerjee) kii college ke dinon se hi raajnneeti main dilchaspee thi or bataur yaheen se unhone siyasat kii abisidi sikhi
 Mamta started her political journey as a Congress party worker from 1970
 saal 1976 se 1980 tak vah mahila congress kii mahasachiv raheen
 In 1984, Mamata Banerjee surprised everyone by defeating the CPM strongman Somnath Chatterjee from Jadavpur Lok Sabha seat
 vah desh kii sabase yuva saansad baniin
 After this, Mamta, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kolkata in 1991, got the opportunity to join the Union Cabinet
 vah narsimha raav sarkaar main maanav sansaadhan vikaas, yuva maamalon or mahila evam bal vikaas vibhaag main rajya mantri baniin
 Apart from this, Mamta was also appointed as Sports Minister in Narasimha Rao government, but later she resigned from this ministry due to some differences
 saal 1999 main mamata banerjee(mamata Banerjee) kii party tiemasi bijepi ke netritv main bani endie sarkaar kaa hissaa bani or mamata ko rail mantri banaaya gaya
 He was also criticized for the announcements made regarding Bengal during his first railway budget
 saal 2001 main jab tahalaka ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to mamata banerjee ne endie se kinaaraa kar liya, lekin 2004 main vah phir endie kaa hissaa baniin
 a period of political upheaval continued and in 2009 she became a part of the ruling UPA and held the post of Railway Minister for the second time
 is bich mamata banerjee pashchim bengal kii siyasat main bhi jaden jamaa rahi thim aursaal 2011 main 'maa, maati, maanush' kaa naaraa dete hue unki party ne vidhansabha chunaavon main baari bahumat se jeet hasil lee
 Mamta Banerjee overthrew the Left government, which is considered invincible in Bengal and became the Chief Minister
 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main unhone dobaaraa karishma dikhaaya or phir siem kii kursi par kabiz huin
 Born on 5 January 1955, Mamata Banerjee is known for her simplicity apart from her rebellious nature and is also known as 'didi' among her fans
 mamata banerjee hameshaa bengali sooti sari or hawaii chappalmen najar atihain
 They have not married
 mamata ke pita swatantraaa senaanee the or jab vah choti thim, tabhi pitaaka dehanth ho gaya tha
 It is said that due to poverty, Mamta took up the responsibility of maintaining the family
 kolkata ke jogamaya devi college seitihaas main onors kii degree ke saatheme or bied padhai kii padhai karne vaali mamata banerjee in dinon phir charchaa main hai
 In the midst of the CBI vs Bengal controversy, she has sat on a dharna with her famous rebellious nature
 payalat jaanata tha ki uske paas plane ko land karaane kaa ek hi mauka he lekin kya isamen jindagi batch paaegi, yah sawaal saamne tha
 The pilot said, 'we chose a particular place because there were neither houses nor electric poles
 ' landing gear ko neeche karte hi plane oobadkhabad or dhul se bhare khet kii sataha par pahunch gaya
 The pilot refused to suddenly fall to the ground during the landing of the plane, stating that the landing gear was working 'for a while' before the plane was damaged under extreme pressure, eventually landing on the ground on the plane main structure reached up
 tippaniyan The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has initiated an investigation into the accident

 South African fast bowler Dale Steyn is one of the best bowlers in the world and remains at the top of the Test bowlers rankings
 philhal test ke is best gendbaaj ne cricket ke is formet kii worst gend phenki
 On the first day of the third Test of the ongoing Test series against the West Indies, West Indies had a five-wicket haul for 218 when Steyn was called up to bowl
 flying kaich hua viralagendbaaji karne aae sten ne iske baad ek aisi gend phenki jo wo khud shaayad hi dekhnaa chahen
 The ball came out of his hand and went straight outside the boundary line on the leg side
 gend itani wide thi ki agar left hander ballebaaj krij par hota to uskaa balla bhi gend tak nahin pahunch paata
 However, apart from this one ball, Steyn bowled brilliantly and took four wickets for 78 runs
 westeindies kii pehali pari 329 ran par simat gai
 See the worst ball of Test cricket: bharat-srilanka vanade siries ke samaapan ke baad antarrashtriya cricket parishad kii ore se jari ranking main viraat kohli ne apane kariyar ke sabase behatar ranking hasil karte hue duusare sthaan par pahunch gaye
 India won the series 4–1
 bhartiya up captain kohli is siries se purv ranking main tisare sthaan par the lekin siries main behatar pradarshan or 296 ran banane kii vajah se unhen ek sthaan kaa phayda hua or duusare sthaan par pahunch gaye
 Kohli, the former captain of India's Under-19 team, scored 866 points, achieving the best rating of his career
 srilanka main hue chauthe vanade main unhone naabad 128 ranon kii pari kheli thi or bharat ne is match ko chah wicket se jeeta tha
 Above Kohli, only South African batsman Hashim Amla now has 13 points more than Kohli
 agar amala igland ke saath 24 agast se shuru hone vaale paanch vanade siries main behatar pradarshan nahin karte hai to kohli unhen pachhad sakate hai
 Three players from India are included in the top 10 batsmen along with Kohli

 Among the other Indian batsmen, Virender Sehwag is 26th, Suresh Raina 30th and Rohit Sharma 54th
 rajyapal ke saath hone vaali baithak talikisaanon ke mudde par honi thi baatcheetmaharashtra main sarkaar gathan kii koshishon kii bich rajyapal ke saath hone vaali shivasena, congress or ensipi netaaon kii saajha baithak ko taal diya gaya he
 The leaders of the three parties were supposed to meet the governor around 4 pm but now this meeting will not take place at the moment
 teenon dalon ke netaa rajya main prashasnic dikkaton or kisaanon kii samasyaon ko lekar aaj rajyapal se milane vaale the
 Now when this meeting will take place, the time has not been decided yet
 chunavi kharch kaa byora dene main biji netajankaree ke mutabik sabhi netaa tay vakt par rajyapal ke paas nahin ja paaenge, jisaki vajah he ki zyaadaatar netaa philhal chunavi kharch kaa byora dene main vyast hai kyonki shanivaar ko uski samaysima khatm ho rahi he
 The issue of the meeting with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari may be farmers but it was believed that the leaders of the three parties can discuss the formation of the government through this meeting
 chunaav main sabase badi party banakar ubhari bijepi ne sankhyabal na hone kii vajah se pehle sarkaar banane se inkaar kar diya he
 After this, the other big party Shiv Sena has decided to form a government with other parties Congress and NCP
 haalanki is par abhi kuch bhi pukhta agenda tay nahin hua he or teenon dal kaaman minimum agenda par kaam kar rahe hai or mantri padon ke bantwaare par bhi baatcheet jari he
 After discussing all these points, the claim of forming the government will be presented before the Governor
 sarkaar gathan par sabake apane davekisi bhi dal kii ore se sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh na karne kii vajah se rajyapal ne philhal maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan laga diya he jiske avadhi 6 maah kii hoti he
 Meanwhile, if the three parties together submit a letter supporting the legislators to the governor, they may get a chance to form the government
 udhar, satta kii daud se dur ho chuki bijepi ke bheetar bhi phir se sarkaar banane kii ichha jaag gai he or party ke netaaon ne daawa kiya he ki soobe main unheen kii party sarkaar banaaegi
 Significantly, in Maharashtra, the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena contested the assembly elections together
 chunaav nateezon main bijepi 105 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari, vahiin shivasena 56 siten paakar duusari sabase badi party bani
 After the election results, there was a tussle between the Shiv Sena and the BJP over the chief minister's chair
 shivasena 50-50 formule par ad gai or bijepi ke siem kii kursi dene ko taiyaar nahin thi
 After this, the 30-year-old alliance broke up and now the Shiv Sena is trying to form a government with the third and fourth party ncp-congress
 chah november ko 11 baje subah sangh vichaarak es
 Gurumurthy met senior BJP leader LK Advani at his residence at 30 Prithviraj Road in Delhi
 mithaiyon or coffee kii chuskiyon ke bich chartered accountint gurumurti ne adwani ko manaane kii koshish kii ki adhyaksh nitin gadakari kii kaarobaari gatividhiyon main kuch bhi aniatik yaa kanoonee taur par galat nahin he
 But instead of explaining his point, the senior BJP leader in turn demanded the resignation of Gadkari
 sangh or adwani ke rishton main us samay se hi tanatani chal rahi he jab 2005 main mohammad ali jinna par kii gai tippanee kii vajah se adwani ko party adhyaksh kii kursi chhodie ke liye vivash hona padaa tha
 The Sangh's intention to defend Gadkari is further strengthened by Advani's opposition
 balance shit or dastavejon ke saath las hokar guru murti ne rajyasabha saansad balbir punj ke saath adwani ke paas do ghante baithkar unhen purti group ke vittiya len-dein ke bare main vistaar se bataaya or daawa kiya ki gadakari kahin bhi doshi nahin hai
 Gurumurthy argued that the reason for the allegations against Gadkari was in fact "technical inconsistencies" and not deliberate corruption
 unhone mana ki bhrashtachar ke aaropon se khud ko baahar nikaalane main bijepi adhyaksh kii ore se hui deree party ke liye mahangi sabit hui he
 The result was cipher
 jan-andolan ke jariye rajnatik manch par aa viraaje arvind kejariwal ne jab unke khilaaf aaropon kii bauchhaar kii thi to us samay adwani hi unka saath dene khadey hue the, lekin ab unke tevar puri tarah badale hue hai
 Advani told Gurumurthy that the image of the party in the minds of the people was getting dirty and that the splatter on Gadkari's personality was not clear, so he should resign before the end of his term on 17 December
 gurumurti ne jaise hi sangh ke aalaa netaaon ko nagpur main yah baat bataai, unhone unhen nirdesh diya ki ve party ke anya netaaon se mulaakaat kar apane netaa ke liye samarthan jutaayein
 Meanwhile, Gadkari was asked to call a party core committee meeting in the evening at the party headquarters at 11 Ashok Road in Delhi, in which Gurumurthy was also supposed to be present
 adwani or sangh ke bich ek anirnay kii sthiti ban gai he
 a Sangh leader said, "the message that Gurumurthy had to give was clear: Gadkari will complete his tenure and there will be no pressure on the Sangh to remove him
" ”phir bhi, agar sangh gadakari ko hataane kii baat maan bhi le to uske paas koi taiyaar vikalp nahin he
 He argues that there is no guarantee that the new president will not face the conspiracy of the Congress or his own allies of the party
 sangh ke ek netaa ne kaha, ‘‘congress or kejariwal sareekhe log unki myaan ke jang ko khangaalane ke liye apni puri urja jhonk denge or aaj, is yug main kuch bhi khoj lenaa vaaki mushkil nahin he
 "therefore, for the Sangh at present, it is Gadkari
 sangh ke poojaneey nayakon main se ek vivekanand ke ikyuu kii tulana mafia sargana daaud ibrahim se karne ke baad unke badbolepan kii aadat par unhen maamuli tahoka dete hue aagaah kiya gaya ki ve apni boli par lagaam rakhen
 Gadkari's second term, however, rests on the scrutiny of the Registrar of Companies
 bijepi nahin chaahegi ki gadakari dobaaraa kursi par aaen, lekin sheersh netaa uttaradhikari ke maamle par ekamat nahin hai
 Well, possible options include Rajnath Singh and M
K
 vankaiya naidu ke naam shaamil hai, jo pehle bhi bijepi adhyaksh kaa pad sambhaal chuke hai, iske alaava varisht upaadhyaksh shanta kumaar kaa naam bhi saamne he
 There are some leaders who feel that the Sangh will ultimately have no choice but to choose either the Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha - Sushma Swaraj or Arun Jaitley
 bijepi ke andar kii ladaai sangh or gaiyr-sanghee netaaon ke bich thani he
 Senior leaders like Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha, who are not associated with the Sangh, joined hands with Rajya Sabha MP Ram Jethmalani to protest against Gadkari
 jethmalani ne 2 november ko adwani ko chitthee main likhaa, ‘‘gadakari ko adhyaksh pad par barkaraar rakhana desh or bijepi kii barbaadi kaa sabab hoga
 "much damage has been done, everything can still be rectified if tried fiercely, and they demanded Gadkari's resignation
" gurumurti ne baad main shaam ko ram jethmalani se mulaakaat kii lekin unka faisla badalawaane main naakaam rahe
 Jethmalani wondered how 'within a few hours' Gurumurthy gave a quick clean chit to Gadkari after reading the detailed documents of Purti Group
 is bich 6 november ko gadakari swaraj or jetali se milane pahunche
 According to sources, Swaraj advised Gadkari to step down for the party's 'oldest and most intelligent leader'
 mana jaataa he ki sushamaa ne yahaan tak kaha ki 8 november ko adwani ke 85wein janmdin par party ko is bare main ghoshnaa kerani chahie
 After this Gurumurthy met Sushma and then Sushma tweeted in support of Gadkari in a hurry
 ek bijepi netaa kehete hai, ‘‘darasal, sushamaa sangh se apane rishton ko behatar karnaa chaahati hai or isamen vah kuch had tak safal bhi raheen
 Anyway, he has to think about his future in the party
 adwani ji vahaan bahut samay tak to rahenge nahin
 "it is true that the Sangh is still on the back foot, but its impact on BJP cannot be underestimated
 sangh parivaar main ubharate nae sameekaran ke bich jetali ne is mudde par puri tarah chuppi saadh rakhi he jo ek tarah se gadakari ke prati unke samarthan par sawaal khadey karti he
 Recently, there has been such a buzz in the party that Jaitley is firmly entrenched in Gujarat's Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Gadkari's uneasy relationship with Modi is well known
 sutron ke mutabik kor cameti kii baithak ke baad jetali ne gadakari ke samarthan main sushamaa swaraj ke saath sanyukt press conference karne se bhi inkaar kar diya, jaisaa ki in donon ne gadakari ke samarthan main pehle kiya tha
 The core committee decided to stand firmly in favor of Gadkari and Jaitley was asked to prepare a statement clarifying the party's position
 jetali iske liye to raji ho gaye, lekin unhone is bayaan ko sushamaa ke saath padhgaye se inkaar kar diya
 The task was then entrusted to party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad
 bayaan main party ke saathiyon se apil kii gai ki ve bijepi adhyaksh ke saath paksh main khadey rahen
 "such an image of the party should not be known that it came under pressure from a section of media and the campaign of the opposition," the statement said
 aaropon main koi dam nahin he
 "with this, the ban on the statement of party leaders on this issue was banned
 ek party kaaryakarta ne kaha, ‘‘party ke bheetar duvidha or uthal-puthal kaa maahaul he
 There is no doubt that the Sangh's position is morally weak, but there is no one inside the party who can oppose it
 adwani kamobesh haashie par daal die gaye hai
 According to Jethmalani's plan, Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha also hesitated to resign from the BJP executive
 ”sangh ke ek varisht netaa ne india today se kaha, sanghathan gadakari kaa samarthan karata rahegaa
 He reluctantly admitted that the removal of Gadkari would loosen the Sangh's grip on the BJP
 unhone palatakar sawaal kiya, ‘‘gadakari ko hi istipha kyon de dena chahie? unhen congress or party kaa ek gut jaan-boojhkar nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 If they resign then these elements will be stronger
 tab ham par or bhi hamale hone lagenge kyonki ye log hamen aasaan shikaar maan lenge
 "the Sangh is not unduly ignoring the thinking of common people
 sangh ke ek anya netaa ne halaat kaa vishleshan kuch is tarah kiya, ‘‘ham bevajaah is baat se pareshaan nahin hote ki log kya sochate hai
 Now it is important for us what the party people think
 isliye gurumurti ji ko bheja gaya jisase party ke bheetar chal rahi paraspar virdohi dhaaraon par ankush lagaaya ja sake
 Public memory is very weak, she will soon forget the charges against Gadkari
 dekhie to, bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baavjood congress ne bhi to salmaan khurshid ko aage badha diya
 "whatever the Sangh thinks, but a very influential camp within the BJP seems to be in the mood across
 kai netaa taaja halaat ko sangh ke saaye se nikal kar ek alag raah akhriyaar karne ke maukey ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 It is, of course, that the voices of protest are not outspoken, but in this way, those who think that the party's image has suffered, it needs to be corrected
 jaisaa ki akele morcha sambhaal rahe jethmalani ne 7 november ko kaha, ‘‘yah meri jimmedaari banati he ki party ko aagaah karun ki uski naitik jameen kamjor ho rahi he isse bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladgaye kii party kii takat bhi kund ho rahi he
 It is a fraud with the public
 ” abhi to jethmalani ne akele hi virodh kaa jhanda buland kar rakhaa he, lekin unhen bharosa he ki jald hi duusare logon main bhi ‘party or deshhit’ ke liye aawaaj uthaane kii himmat aa jaaegi

 keaarke ne bhi is maamle par apni safai dete hue ajay devgan par unhen rishwat dene or karan johar sang tanatani ke liye unhen bali kaa bakra banane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 According to the report of the Indian Express newspaper, KRK called a press conference and tried to prove to the media that he had a good professional and personal relationship with Kumar Mangat by showing a check of 3 crore of the name of Kumar Mangat's company
 kumaar mangat vahiin hai jo ajay devgan dwaara jari kii gai audio clip main keaarke se baat kar rahe hai

 yah donon filmein is saal 28 oktober ko relies ho rahi hai
 However, RK said in a press conference that Karan Johar did not give him any 25 lakh rupees, to avoid the questions of Kumar Mangat
 keaarke lagaataar ajay devgan ke is maamle ko lekar aae bayaan par nishaanaa sadhate rahe
 Ajay Devgan had given a statement that he has an emotional connection with this industry and people like Keke are spoiling the atmosphere of the industry
 ajay ke is bayaan par keaarke ne kaha, 'ajay devgan industry main aane se pehle do kaudi ke insaan the or ab vah arbapati ho gaye hai
 He has no emotional attachment to the industry
 unako sirf paison se lagaav he
 He is also of no help to the old producer of the movie 'action Jackson' when he was going through a loss due to being a movie flop
 'jab tak he jaan' film ke dauraan jab yash chopra kaa dehant hua tab har kisi ne unhen apni film 'san of sardaar' kii date shift karne ko kaha lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Is this his emotional connection with the industry? 'kearkene aage yah bhi kaha ki ajay devgan karan johar sang takaraav ke liye unhen bali kaa bakra bana rahe hai
 And with a gun on his shoulder, Karan wants to target Johar

 After the ban on hookah bars imposed in all cities of Haryana, now the Drug Control Department has come up to stop the sale of hookah tobacco
 tippaniyan The department had also banned the sale of tobacco used in hookah after hookah bars, but even after this, tobacco is being sold in Gurgaon indiscriminately
 On receiving this information, the Drugs Control Department raided several shops in the Sadar Bazar of Gurgaon and seized huge quantities of tobacco
 bhale hi drugs control vibhaag kii yah ek acchhee pahal ho lekin vibhaag kii giraft main aayaa yah dukandaar to is kaale kaarobaar kii ek choti si machhlee he lekin is kaarobaar ko chalaane vaale magaramchh to abhi bhi aaraam se is drugs ke dhandhe ko chalaa rahe hai

 The picture of the results of the Lok Sabha election 2019 has now become completely clear
 542 loksabhaa siton main se 523 siton par nattejey aa gaye hai or ye bhi tay ho gaya he ki is baar bhi desh ko vipaksh kaa netaa nahin milegaa
 The Congress Party has emerged as the second largest party this time, with the Congress having a total of 52 seats
 lekin loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa ke liye jitna aankada chahie usase vah abhi bhi dur he
 Because the Congress has barely reached the figure of 52 and 10 percent seats are required to take the post of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 yani 543 loksabhaa siton main se kul 55 siten hona jaruri he, tabhi kisi party ko vipakshi netaa kaa pad miltaa he
 But Congress is three seats away from this figure
 haalanki, abhi 543veen seat par chunaav hona baaki he, aise main ye sankhya maujuuda siton ke hisaab se badal bhi sakati he
 The same thing happened in the 16th Lok Sabha i
e
 2014, when the Congress was reduced to just 44 seats
 tab bhi congress ko ye pad nahin mila tha
 Mallikarjun Kharge, who became the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, kept fighting for this post for five years, but could not be found
 kai baar unhone centre kii narendra modi sarkaar se ye pad dene kii guhaar bhi lagaai, lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 It is also worth noting that Mallikarjun Kharge, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, himself has lost the election this time
 ab sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki agar centre sarkaar vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad congress ko detii he to kaman koun sanbhaalega, yaa congress kii taraf se unka sadan kaa netaa koun hoga
 Whether Rahul Gandhi himself will hold this position is also discussed
 kis rajya main congress ko milin kitni siten

 Manoj Chandran would have engaged in a strange activity in the solitude of the night
 aadhi raat ko vah apane kamare main band ho jaataa or phir subah 7 baje tiruanantpuram ke malamukal sthit saint shanthal hair secondary skool ke liye nikalne se pehle apni maa or bahan se milane baahar nikalataa
 What did he do alone during those dark moments of the night? His mother Anu was surprised by the sudden change in the son's behavior
 lekin, phir ve khud ko samajhaatin ki unka betaa kishoravastha main he or sambhawatah use kuch samay akele gujaarne kii jarurat mahasoos hoti ho
 Manoj had better technical knowledge and liked to play computer games on desktop
 ab vah apane kamare ke ekant main apane mobile phone par internet main mashgool ho jaaya karata
 Anu thought, this new hobby of the son will not last more than the tune of adolescence
 unhen to yah baad main samaj aayaa ki bete ke vyavhaar main aae badlaav is baat ke sanket the ki kahin kuch badi gadabadi he
 The warning signs of sleep-wake-up habit had changed and he became irritable
 pehle se kahin adhik bhavuk bhi
 Once, he told his mother that he was going to see a concert with his friends, but he reached Shankumugham Beach alone
 aise hi ek baar vah akele hi paas ke kabristaan main idhar-udhar bhatakta rahaa
 In February this year, when Anu saw her bandage tied, Manoj tried to spin the story by telling her that she got hurt while climbing the wall
 anu ke jid karne par usne haath dikhaaya
 He made a deep incision with the compass, writing the letters "A", "B" and "I" on his hand
 poochne par kaha, ''bas, maje ke liye
 "anu remembers the day when Manoj very easily sprang to death
 usne maa se kaha tha, agar vah kabhi mrit miltaa he to kya unka dil tut jayega? anu ko kuch samaj main nahin aayaa tha or yah kehete hue cheekh padi thim ki is tarah kii baton par charchaa se to acha he ve mar jaae
 Manoj then hugged the mother laughing
 haalanki manoj tunakmizaaj ho chukaa tha or gumsum rahane laga tha, lekin kabhi-kabhi maa ke saath laad bhi karata
 Used to talk to them about films or school teachers
 pichley november main manoj ne maa ko blue whale chalange ke bare main bhi bataaya tha
 "she told me about a strange task online game," says Anu
 task puraa karne par use pagal ho jane yaa aatmahatya kar lene yaa phir apane kisi priy ko maar daalane ke liye kaha janaa tha
 "when Anu wanted to know why he wanted to play such a game, Manoj avoided the question
 ghabaraai anu ne bete se yah vaada karne ko kaha ki vah yah game nahin khelegaa
 Manoj also swore
 lekin 26 july ko anu or unke pati di
 Ramachandran finds the son hanging from the bedroom ceiling
 donon ne vilappilsla police stesan main shikaayat darj karai, jisamen puure vishwaas ke saath kaha ki unke bete kii aatmahatya ke peeche blue whale chalange game hi tha
 a dangerous gameblue Whale Challenge, a social media game named after the whale habit that whales go to the beach themselves to end their lives
 kathith taur par is game ko viksit kiya he rus ke philip budekin ne
 21-year-old Philip, arrested in May 2017, has reportedly admitted that he instigated 16 schoolgirls to commit suicide
 apane ikbaalia bayaan main budekin ne jaahir taur par kaha ki uskaa uddeshy duniya ko ''jaivik kachare" se nijaat dilaanaa tha or vah ''khushi-khushi marane waalon" ko prerit kar darasal ''samaaj kii safai" kar rahaa tha
 The first victim of the Blue Whale Challenge is believed to have committed suicide four years ago
 tab se yah khel rus, america, britain, italy, brazil, argentina or portugal main 150 aatmahatyaon kaa kaaran bana
 Budkin is not believed to be the only administrator of the game, who has to complete 50 tasks within 50 days and the player has to end his life in the final task
 is game ke administration se jude hone ke kaaran june main 26 varshiya postman elia sidrove ko bhi girakrataar kiya gaya tha
 However, this case is not as clear
 vird patrika ne is varsh may main is par report di, ''online tathyon kii jaanch-padtaal karne vaali website snops ne paaya he ki beshak pichley chah maheenon ke dauraan puure rus main yuvaaon ke aatmahatya karne ke maamle saamne aae, lekin unhen is game se jodgaye kaa koi spasht saboot nahin
 "the period of suicides in India is not the only suicide of Manoj linked to this game in India
 kerala police kaa kahana he ki vah aise hi do anya maamalon kii bhi takratish kar rahi he
 One case is related to a 22-year-old IT student who committed suicide in July while another was a commerce student in Palakkad, who committed suicide on March 30, the day the exam was over
 donon hi maamalon main yuvaaon ke parijanon ne bacchon ke vyavhaar main ajeeb badlaav kaa zikr karte hue maamle darj karaae jo blue whale chalange se jude anya maamalon se mail khate hai
 The behaviors of the teen victims of these incidents were allegedly dangerous or antisocial, such as walking on the roof mound, wandering alone in the cemetery, early in the morning
 20 baje horer filmein dekhnaa yaa phir apane badan par blue whale kii akruti kaa chira lagaana
 In this game, as the hunt progresses towards the final "challenge", the task becomes dangerous
 maano unhen kadam-dar-kadam marane ko taiyaar kiya ja rahaa ho
 The matter becomes even more complicated because the Blue Whale Challenge is not a traditional schmuck
 kuch log kehete hai ki ye khel smartphone ap se khelaa jaataa he
 In Manoj's case, the Cyberdrome, the technical arm of the Kerala Police, did not find any such app in his phone
 darasal, yah na to koi paaramparik game he or na hi koi ap
 It is more than likely that "challengers" Buddekin and other "handlers" weaponize social media sites such as vk
com (russian sites like Facebook) to reach their victims
 kisi vyannti ko game khilne ke liye tabhi aamantrit kiya jaataa he jab usamen manovaigyanik tanaav, avsaad yaa aatmahatya kii pravriti ke kuch lakshan dikhen
 It is estimated that Budkin, a psychology student, has also prepared a psychological test that is used before inviting anyone to play the game and is told strictly to erase the social media records of the conversation Let's go manoj kaa mobile ab bhi sicredrome ke kabje main he or uski jaanch chal rahi he
 Whether or not this game is responsible for Manoj's death, the case has raised serious questions on cyber security and mental health of teenagers

 chittaranjan andrade ne 2012 main ''aatmahatyah ek bhartiya pariprekshy naamak lekh main ''sibar aatmahatya" ko ek ubhartee pravriti bataaya tha
 "cyber suicide" is used to indicate cases of suicide or attempted suicide in which the Internet plays a role
 aaj kii digital duniya main khatra or bhi bad jaataa he kyonki na to unki ulajhanon ko sunne-samajhane vaala koi hota he na hi vaastavik duniya main unki hataasha yaa akelepan ko dur karne kaa koi saadhan hota he or aise main bacchon ke liye duniyabar main sulabh internet ke jaal main funs janaa bada aasaan hota he

 Menon said that 'covert cross-border activities' have happened even during the tenure of previous governments, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government decided not to expose them to the public, because these attacks have far more consequences than affecting public opinion

 aap shartiya jaanate honge, kisi baat ko badha-chadhaakar bakhaan karnaa kise kehete hai, lekin aapke man main basii 'badha-chadhaakar baat karne' se judi sabhi 'paribhaashaon ko badal daalane ke liye ham dhundhakar laae hai ek nayaa utyub video, jo na sirf 'asambhav darje kaa bevakoof' kirdaar dikhaa rahaa he, balki puri tarah mahilavirohi bhi he
 
 
 Titled 'every Rich Girl in the World', this video is being viewed by people on youtube, and just like us, wondering if the girl shown in it could actually be

 According to the video, every rich father's daughter (literally every daughter) is spoiled, snappy, arrogant, stupid and ignorant
 
 
 video ke hisaab se rais pitaaon kii aisi betiyaan khud ko isliye bhi 'garib' (urban poor) mahasoos karne lagati hai, kyonki ve 'noz job' (naak kii cosmetic surgery) nahin karvaa saktin
 
 
 She also considers herself 'poor' because her father's name was not in the Panama Papers
 
 
 yah 'bechaari rais ladki' itani agyani bhi he, jise nahin pataa, iemai kya hoti he, kanpur kahaan he, blike coffee ko hindi main kya kehete hai, or vah is baat se bhi hairaan hokar dikhaati he ki bhikhaari credit card kabool nahin karte
 
 
 Do you know someone who is so stupid?

 This video, shared by a popular youtube channel, directly tries to make fun of the problems that the rich girls have for the video makers, but actually not only this video has not become funny at all
 , Is rather outgunned, and hurts
 
 
 video ke hisaab se har rais pita kii har beti (sachmuch har beti) bigadi hui, nakchadhi, ghamandi, bevakoof or agyani hoti he
 
 
 According to the video, such daughters of rich fathers also feel themselves 'poor' because they cannot get 'nose job' (cosmetic surgery of nose)
 
 
 ve khud ko isliye bhi 'garib' maanane lagati hai, kyonki unke pita kaa naam panama peparon main nahin tha
 
 
 This 'poor rich girl' is also so ignorant, who does not know what is EMI, where is Kanpur, what is black coffee called in Hindi, and she is also shocked to show that beggars do not accept credit cards
 
 
 
 kya aap aise kisi shaks ko jaanate hai, jo itnaa hi bevakoof ho

 In the area of punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, a big scam of Rs 40 crores has happened before the last assembly elections
 yahaan ke logon ko nae ghar or ghar kii marammat ke liye 40 karod rupee baante gaye, lekin hakeekat kuch or he
 Actually, the villagers did not get this money
 gauratlab he ki vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle janvari 2011 se march 2012 ke bich mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke kshetra ke liye ek tarah se sarkari khajaane khol die gaye
 PUDA disbursed 45 million rupees from the State Infrastructure Fund in the name of building houses to the poor
 isamen se 40 karod rupee sirf muktsar main baante gaye, jo mukhyamantri badal kaa jila he or unke nirvachan kshetra lambi ko bhi iskaa phayda mila
 The remaining 5 crore came in the share of five other districts
 bina kisi project report ke piudie ne jis taarikh ko rupee baante us par ab sawaal uthne lage hai
 HC Arora, Senior Advocate of the High Court, told how CM Badal ordered DC to release Rs 10 crore in a single day
 ye chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone se sirf ek maheene pehle kii baat he
 Why was such a large portion of the amount given only in the Chief Minister's district? What was the motive behind this is clear
 udhar, artiai ke jariye mili jaankaree ke mutabik, muktsar jile ke 19 hajaar garib pariwaron ko skim kaa phayda mila or chah hajaar pariwaron ko 35-35 hajaar rupee kaccha ghar banane ko baante gaye or 13 hajaar pariwaron ko 15-15 hajaar rupee ghar kii marammat ke liye die gaye, lekin enditivi kii team jab gaanv pahunchi to pataa chalaa ki zyaadaatar logon ko sirf 15 se 18 hajaar rupee die gaye
 5 thousand checks and the rest of the building material was divided into it
 gaanvvaalon ke kahana he ki ye phayda bhi akali dal ke logon or unke karibiyon ko hi mila
 The comments bakaul ek gramin, sarkaar ne 5 hajaar lebaron ke liye 6 hajaar inten, reta or 18 bori cement mila
 The house was not completed in this regard
 sabane apane paise lagaae
 The government had promised to give 10-15 thousand more, but now it will not be found
 ek duusare gramin ne bataaya ki hamen kabhi koi check nahin mila, or logon ko mila, hamane bahut koshish kii thi
 Not only this, a large amount of money was given to Bhai Kheda, the village of Lambi, the area of chief Minister
 yahaan ke ek ghar ke liye dedh lakh rupee bhi die gaye
 In this way, EWS houses were also built in Muddu Kheda village of Lambi, but they were so poorly constructed that they are not able to live
 zyaadaatar to adhure pade hai
 Allotting is later
 congress ne puure maamle kii jaanch kii maang kii he, lekin mukhyamantri jaanch kii baat to dur kisi bhi gadabadi se saaf inkaar kar rahe hai
 Prakash Singh Badal said that all these records are with DC
 aarope lagane vaale lagaate rahete hai
 It is worth noting that between January 2011 and March 2012, just before the assembly elections, in some way government treasuries were opened for Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's area
 piudie ne state infrastracchar fund ke 45 karod rupee garibon ko ghar banane ke naam par baante
 Of this, 40 crore rupees were distributed only in Muktsar, which is the district of Chief Minister Badal and his constituency Lambi also benefited from this
 baaki ke 5 karod paanch duusare jilon ke hisse main aae
 Without any project report, the date on which the PUDA distributed the money has now started raising questions
 hoicourt ke varisht vakil echsi aroda ke bataaya ki ek hi din main kis tarah siem badal ne disi ko 10 karod rupee jari karne ke aadesh die
 This election was just one month before the Code of Conduct came into force
 sirf mukhyamantri ke jile main hi raashi kaa bada hissaa diya gaya aisa kyon? iske peeche kya makasad tha, saaf he
 On the other hand, according to the information received through RTI, 19 thousand poor families in Muktsar district got the benefit of the scheme and six thousand families were given 35-35 thousand rupees to build a raw house and 13 thousand families got 15-15 thousand rupees
 They were given for repair, but when the NDTV team reached the village, it was found that most people were given only 15 to 18 thousand rupees
 isamen 5 hajaar ke check or baaki kaa building material baanta gaya
 The villagers say that this benefit was given only to the Akali Dal people and their close ones
 tippaniyan a villager, the government got 6 thousand bricks, sand and 18 sacks of cement for 5 thousand labors
 itane main makaan puraa nahin hua
 Everyone put their money
 sarkaar ne 10-15 hajaar or dene kaa vaayada kiya tha, lekin ab lagata nahin milegaa
 Another villager told that we never got any check, and got people, we had tried a lot
 yahi nahin mukhyamantri ke ilaake lambi ke gaanv bhai kheda ke liye badi rakam de di gai
 One and a half lakh rupees were also given for a house here
 is tarah lambi ke hi muddu kheda gaanv main bhi edablyooes makaan banaae gaye, lekin inamen itnaa ghatiya nirmaan hua ki ye rahane ke kaabil nahin hai
 Most are lying incomplete
 alot karnaa baad kii baat he
 The Congress has demanded an inquiry into the entire matter, but the Chief Minister is clearly denying any wrongdoing while away from the investigation
 prakaash singh badal ne kaha ki ye sara record disi ke paas hota he
 Accusers keep on accusing
 hoicourt ke varisht vakil echsi aroda ke bataaya ki ek hi din main kis tarah siem badal ne disi ko 10 karod rupee jari karne ke aadesh die
 This election was just one month before the Code of Conduct came into force

 kitaab kaa naam–24 din 24 batelekhak–dow
 Praveen Tiwari: This is the second book by author and TV journalist Praveen Tiwari
 apni pehali pustak 'satya kii khoj' kii agali kadi main unhone yuvaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vyaktitv vikaas ke liye 24 abhyaason par roshni daali he
 The book says that with every success, confidence increases, but it is also true that success comes only to those who have confidence
 aatmavishvaas koi aisi cheez nahin jise baahar se kisi ke sharir main daalaa ja saktaa he
 With each passing moment of life you are either weakening your confidence or strengthening it
 koi or kaise aapse prabhavit ho saktaa haijab tak aap swayan apane prabhaavshaalee vyaktitv ko nahin dekhte hai
 Knowing your personality on your own is the first step towards strengthening self-confidence
 kyonki koi shortkurt nahin hotaaatmavishvaas kaa koi shortkurt nahin he
 If you have prepared well, you have done so, then you will be confident in yourself
 swimming pool main jaaenge to aap dekhenge ki nausikhie yaa nae-nae swimming seekhney waalon main kitna dar hota he, jabaki kai anbhavi tairaak aise hote hai jo aate hai or chhapaak se chalaang laga dete hai
 They also learn new innovative techniques of swimming
 unke aatmavishvaas ke mul main bhi abhyaas hi hota he
 They also start with fear, but once you get used to it, there is a continuous increase in confidence
 jindagi bhi kisi samandar se kam nahin, jisamen chhapaak se chalaang laga dene kii takat dikhti he wo aatmavishvaas se labarej najar aata he
 Here, learning is the most important
 kisi bhi vidha kosikhney kii tarahahaar, jeet, utaar, chadhaav in sari baton ko jivan jeene kii kala kaa hissaa maanakar chalane vaale jivan kii tairaaki bhi sikh lete hai
 Practicing practice is the only way to increase self-confidence
 seekhney kii aadat aatmbal ko badhaati he
 Look at your life and see what you have learned till date? You will find that you are more confident in the disciplines you have learned
 yadi aap jaanate hai ki seekhney main kuch samay lagata he or har kala ko seekhney ke shuruaati dinon main kuch galtiyaan swabhaavik rup se hoti hai, to aap kisi bhi vidha main paarangat ho sakate hai
 The qualities of patience and will are important in this
 pareshaan na hon, sabhi nausikhie rahe hamechha vyaktitv chaahate hai to abhyast tairaakon ko dekhakar pareshaan na hon
 He too must have been a novice and he too struggled like you
 pareshaani tab hoti he jab ham swayan ko nausikhia dikhaane main shame mahasoos karne lagate hai
 Where you consider yourself to be learned, your development gets interrupted
 aap kitna aage ja sakate hai ye is baat se tay hota he ki aap kitna abhyaas karte hai
 Continuation of learning is the continuation of your confidence boost
 aap apane kaaryakshetra se itar bhi kai kalaon or vidhaon kaa prashikshan le sakate hai
 All the research confirms that those who are interested in learning more and more genres have a relatively high confidence level
 aap apane vyaktitv ko nikhaarane ke prayaason kaa satat abhyaas karte rahiye or aap paaenge ki aap apane saamaanya jivan or vyavsaayik jivan donon main us aatmavishvaas ko dikhaane main kaamyaab hote hai
 Living among people, facing different situations is also a practice
 kai aise log dekhne ko milte hai jo aamtaur par bahirmukhi hote hai, lekin saarvajanik manchon par yaa vishesh paristhitiyon main unki ghigghi bandha jaati he
 Then there are many people who surprise people with their performance in the first place
 abhyaas hi ekmaatr rasta haiaatmavishvaas kisi tonic ko pine se nahin miltaa, iske liye satat abhyaas hi ek maatr rasta he
 There should be no missed opportunity to speak, write or express yourself in public forums
 lekin ye bhi dhyaan rakhen ki aap agar bina taiyaari ke aisa karte hai to asafalataa hi haath lagegi
 The twinge of failure scares you with such performances even further
 ek baar is tarah kaa dar ghar kar jaae to phir aap kaa aatmavishvaas kamjor hone lagata he
 Weakness of confidence is a disease
 ise apane dimag main jaraa bhi sthaan na den
 More important than strengthening confidence is to be alert to the things that weaken it
 khoobiyon ke bajaay kamiyon par dhyaan dena aatmavishvaas ko kamjor karata he
 Anxiety rather than that which is not, also weakens both time and confidence
 asafalataa kaa bhay or log kya sochenge kaa bhay aatmavishvaas ko kamjor karte hai
 When you take personality building as an exercise, then you are able to feel these things better
 vichaaron ke kolahal ke bich thik se dekhnaa, sunanaa or anya abhyaason par ye pustak sahaj or saral bhashaa main prakaash daalati he

 No one should be saved from monkeys
 The voters of about two dozen villages here have demanded freedom from the terror of monkeys, not electricity, water and roads in the election
 yahaan ke logon ko pichley 15 saal se bandaron ne pareshaan kar rakhaa he
 The monkeys have caused havoc in the villages of Saharsa and Bakhtiyarpur
 15 saal se bandaron kaa kaharlathi- danda lekar gaanv ke log har roj kisi dushman se nipatane ke liye nahin, balki bandaron se apni fasal bachaane ke liye taiyaar hote hai
 For 15 years, thousands of monkey farmers have been wasting kifsal
 in bandaron ke rahete logon ko baahar aane- jane or khaane- pine kii cheez laane main kaaphi mashkkat kerani padati he
 There are 10 thousand farmers
 a man from the affected village told that the monkeys have ruined the crops of about 10 thousand farmers
 is samasya ko prashasan or bihar sarkaar ke saamne uthaaya gaya, lekin koi karrwai nahin hui
 Elections begin and end, but nothing changes
 chunaav ke dauraan pratyaashee vaada karte hai ki chunaav jeet kar, unki sahaayta karenge
 All promises prove to be hollow
 vot dene gaye, to bandar aa jaaengeyaha ke matadaataaon kii koi maang nahin he, ve sirf bandaron se nijaat paanaa chaahate hai
 The people of the village say that by the time they go to Vevotdene, monkeys will ruin their harvest
 yahaan kii haalat itani kharaab ho gai he ki bacchon ko skool bhejne kii bajaay fasalon kii rakhwali ke liye khet bheja jaataa he
 The women of the village do not allow the children to go anywhere to play

 didie ke drow main ghotaalaa karanevaalon ne hajaaron kii khushiyon par pani pher diya he or kaiyon kii kismat par kaalikh pot di
 Laxminarayan Meena, one of the accused in the scam, has already been arrested and on Sunday, the second accused, Deepak, went under police custody
 lekin ye deepak police ke haath aane ke chaar ghante pehle aaj tak ke haath lag gaya tha
 The accused living in Paschim Vihar, Delhi, opened the secrets on the camera till date which tell the whole story of the scam
 dilli police deepak ko lakshmi narayan meena kaa saathi maanati he
 Deepak told that not only 177 forms but 500-700 fake forms were filled in the DDA
 shuruyaat main deepak ko laga ki ye log 8-10 form bharkar apana flats pakkaa karnaa chaahate hai lekin form 10 se 100 or 100 se 500 hone lage to deepak ko ahsaas ho gaya ki wo anjaane main ek badi saazish kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 According to Deepak, the matter was reported to the police but the police did not take any action
 deepak ne is ghotaale main didie ke adhikariyon ke bhi shaamil hone kii baat kahi
 The DDA was claiming that his house had nothing to do with the scam
 lekin ab didie kya kahegaa
 Now the question is that if the police had such a complaint before the draw, then why the investigation was not done
 dra kii prakriya ko kyon nahin roka gaya or kyon didie ne shikaayat ke baad bhi jaanch kii zarurat nahin samajhi
 Lakshmi Narayan is a short link to this scam
 farji pan card banavaane se lekar flats nikalwane tak ke is puure khel main aise kai or giroh jude hai
 It is probably beyond the capacity of Delhi Police to bring all these under the scanner
 kitaab:note just en accountint- da diary of neshans concense keeper (english)lekhakalavinod rypublisherharoopa publiceshanadishan:hard bound (288 pej)keemtah500 rupaloksabhaa chunaav ke baad kitaab jari karne ke faisle ke chalate bhale hi bhootpurv sieji vinod raay kii 'not Just an Accountant' prime time tivi par surkhiyon main nahin rahi, par koi shaks jo prime time par chhaae rahane vaale ghotaalon ke bare main jaananaa chahta he, uske liye is kitaab ko padhanaa behad jaruri he
 The book has three parts - the first part makes the readers aware of the author and his organization
 doosraa hissaa 2ji, kaamanwealth, kolgate, hydrocarbon (reliance) or air india main hue ghotaalon kaa postmortem karata he
 The last part of the book narrates Vinod Rai's personal views
 kitaab ke bare main sabase khaas isko likhane kii vajah he
 The reason for writing the book is not to lose hands in the flowing Ganges of accusations against Congress or Dr
 Manmohan Singh
 haalanki kitaab ke duusare hisse main takreeban saare ghotaalon ke bare main yah kaha gaya ki pradhanmantri or unke karyaalay ne jaanboojh kar chizon ko andekha kiya yaa sarsari taur par sansad or desh ko gumraah karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Vinod Rai, an officer of Kerala cadre, should have experience with local leaders or the difference between the then defense minister Mulayam Singh Yadav's transfer of an air force sergeant, book and audit report, in this book is
 lekin duusare hisse main, jahaan lekhak bhootpurv sieji kii kalam se bade ghotaalon ko pathakon ke saamne rakh rahe hai, ek inch bhi aatmagat bhav yaa kori gap ko jagah nahin di gai he
 Whatever has been said is based on the facts
 ucchtam str par sarkari sanliptata yaa bhrashtachar rokane main udaseenta ke thos pramaanon ke alaava kitaab ko pard kar aisa mahasoos hota he, jaise nae saal kii purvasandhya par saal bhar surkhiyon main rahi khabaron kii tarah hi saare mahatvapurn ghotaalon ko ek saath suna diya gaya ho
 Perhaps this is also the reason for Vinod writing the book
 ek taraf sieji kii haisiyat se vinod raay ankhon ke saamne rashtriya smapda or sansadhano kii lut dekh rahe the or duusari taraf satta paksh kaa puraa raajnneetik tantra unako khalanaayak sabit karne main laga tha
 Vinod Rai has once done the work of setting some criteria for the future rather than just defending himself through this 'diary' once he has lifted the pen
 duusare shabdon main ye kaha ja saktaa he ki is kitaab ke jariye vartmaan sarkaar par yah naitik jimmedaari chhod di gai he ki pichley das saal main kii gai gadabadiyon ke liye jimmedaari tay kii jaae
 Within which the businessmen and bureaucrats will come not only the leaders
 raay ne kitaab main aisi nitiyon ko badalane kii jarurat bataai he, jinke chalate gadabadi hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 It has to be seen whether any radio broadcast or Vijayadashami speech gives an account of efforts to meet these criteria
 raay is ummid ke saath apni baat khatm karte hai ki jo urja 2012 ke virodh pradarshan main dilli ke chaatr-naujavaanon ne dikhaai thi, wo kahin na kahin desh main system ke sad jane ke khilaaf baghawat he or yahi hamaari sabase badi ummid he
 Rai mentioned in the book that according to him, the biggest hope is for the educated and urban middle class to enter politics
 jo desh ko shreshthata kii taraf le jayega
 This is the part where there is scope for debate with the author
 jin jan-andolanon kaa raay ne zikr kiya, wo beshak desh ke itihaas main mile kaa pathar sabit honge, lekin usase yah ummid karnaa ki ham bhrashtachar yaa korporate lut par jeet hasil kar lenge, dur kii kaudi he
 The book remained untouched by some important issues
 ghotaalon se yaa to sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan hota he yaa aane vaale rajasav kaa

 Vaidyanath temple located in Deoghar district of Jharkhand is the ninth Jyotirlinga among the 12 Jyotirlingas
 vaise to vaidyanath dham main pratidin hajaaron shraddhalu aate hai, parantu bhagwaan shiv ke sabase priy maheene sawan main yahaan unke lakhon bhakton kaa hujum umadta he
 Every day about one lakh devotees come here to perform Jallabhishek of Jyotirlinga
 inaki sankhya somvaar ke din or bad jaati he
 According to mythological beliefs, this Jyotirlinga was brought here by Lankapati Ravana
 shiv puraana ke anusaar, shiv ne ravan ko uski tapasya se prasann hokar manovanchit vardaan diya tha
 Ravana had expressed his desire to take Lord Shiva with him from Mount Kailash to Lanka
 bhagwaan shiv ne khud lanka jane se manaa kar diya, lekin apane bhakt ravan ko jyotirling le jane kii salaah di
 At the same time, if he placed it somewhere on the road, it will be installed there, no one will be able to lift it from there
 idhar, bhagwaan vishnu nahin chaahate the ki jyotirling lanka pahunche
 He requested Ganga to assimilate into Ravana's stomach
 ganga jaise hi ravan ke pet main samaai, ravan ko teevr laghushanka lagi
 He started thinking that by handing the Jyotirlinga to whom he would retire from small-time
 usee kshan gwaale ke vesh main bhagwaan vishnu vahaan prakat hue
 Ravana handed over the Jyotirlinga to the cow and instructed that he should not keep the Jyotirlinga on the ground until he came
 ravan laghushanka karne laga, ganga ke prabhaav se use nivrutt hone main kaaphi der lag gai
 When he returned, Gwala had become extinct keeping Jyotirlinga on the ground
 iske baad ravan ne jyotirling ko uthaane kii lakh koshish kii, magar safal nahin ho sakaa, use khaali haath lanka lautnaa padaa
 Later all the gods and goddesses came and duly installed that Jyotirlinga and worshiped
 kaaphi dinon baad baijnath naamak ek charvaahe ko is jyotirling kaa darshan hua
 He started worshiping it every day
 isi kaaran is jyotirlig kaa naam vaidyanath ho gaya
 Principal of Balananda Sanskrit College, Deoghar, Dr
 mohananand mishra ne bataaya, ‘is jyotirling kii katha vibhinn puraanon main varnit he, kintu shiv puraana main yah katha vistrut rup se he
 It is mentioned that Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga was founded by Lord Vishnu himself
 jis sthaan par yah jyotirling he, uske anek naam prachlit hai
 Such as Haritaki Forest, Chitabhoomi, Rankhand, Ravaneshwar Kanan, Hridaypeeth
 ’sawan main kanvad lekar vaidyanath dham jane kaa bahut mahatv he
 Shiva devotees fill the water from Uttar Vahini Ganga in Sultanganj and travel for 105 km on foot and offer water to the Lord
 saamanyatya kanvad main jal bharkar chalane vaale bhakton ko ‘bam’ kaha jaataa he, parantu jo is yatra ko 24 ghante main puraa karte hai ve ‘dak bam’ kehalaate hai
 People who come here believe that Lord Shiva fulfills all their wishes, especially the importance of worship of Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga is due to the liberation and fulfillment of wishes

 Even for the first time, the words he said to me in private were, 'my mother is everything to me, your place will always be second

 i accepted his love and dedication towards his mother
 lekin maine mahasoos kiya ki unki jindagi main duusari mahila kii bhaawanaaon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Don't forget to eat before sleeping, these 10 things were a habit of my mother-in-law that she used to tell every thing about me to her son
 jaise- main khaanaa banane main export nahin hum, naukari karne kii vajah se mere paas exparts kii tarah khaanaa banane kaa samay bhi nahin rahata tha
 i could not cook as per the expectations of my mother-in-law but she would not tell me anything

 My mother-in-law refused to come there, citing the reason for not doing the suit
 main kareeb ek maheene ke liye apane pati ke saath duusare shahar main rahi
 During this time my mother-in-law brought my husband's grandmother home

 i would be constantly taunted
 vah yah bhi kehane lagi ki main unhen unke bete se chin lenaa chaahati hum

 ek din unhone mujhase maayke jane ke liye kah diya
 He told me that i should come home now only when he calls
 mere parents or meri lagaataar koshishon ke baavjood bhi unhone mujhe dekhne or baat karne se manaa kar diya
 My husband told his mother every thing about our time spent together
 ab vah logon ke saamne har ek baat ko apane rang dekar pesh karti hai
 She tells people that i was not the perfect wife for their son and that is why our family could not grow
 mere pati unki har ek baat ko maanate hai

 dabaav itnaa badha ki pakistani sarkaar ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf oparation par majaboor hona padaa he
 After the Uri attack, Nawaz Sharif very cleverly tried to prove Pakistan clean in front of the world
 bhartiya sena ne pioke main sargical strike kiya to pakistan ke hukmaranon ne ise sargical strike maanane se inkaar kiya
 An attempt was made by India to cover it up as a ceasefire violation
 lekin in donon ghatnaon se duniya ko ek baar phir se pataa chal gaya kipakistanmen aatank kii factory chal rahi he or vahaan ke hukmran ise shah de rahe hai
 Why the proximity to Modi? Deployment of Pakistani troops on the outskirts has been increased due to the ongoing tension between the two countries
 lekin maujuuda halaat ko lekar pakistan main siyaasi halchal tej ho gai
 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf leader Imran Khan accused Nawaz Sharif of increasing closeness to Indian PM Narendra Modi
 imran ne kaha he ki navaj sharif nenarendra modiko galat signal die, jisaki vajah se pakistan aaj duniya main alag-thalag hone kii kagaar par he
 Imran accused Nawaz Sharif and his family of being deeply engulfed in corruption, saying that they are wasting the money of Pakistani people
 hafiz ko lekar sawalbharat ke most wanted aatanki hafiz said ke khilaaf ab pakistan main bhi aawaaj uthne lagi hai
 Rana Mohammad Afzal, the ruling Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N) MP, has demanded action against Hafiz
 afjal ne kaha, 'hafiz said koun se andey detaa he ki jis vajah se hamane use paal rakhaa he
 The condition of Pakistan's foreign policy is that till today we could not end Hafiz Saeed
 bharat ne hafiz said ko lekar duniya main pakistan kii ek aisi chhavi bana di he ki jab kashmir ke mudde par pakistan duniya main apni baat rakhata he to vahaan ke adhikari kehete hai ki hafiz ke kaaran donon deshon ke sambandh kharaab hai
 The Pakistani military rulers on terror have now understood that their "shoplifting of terror" will not last long
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki navaj sharif sarkaar ne apni sena se aatankiyon par nakel kasne ko kah diya he
 According to reports in Pakistani media, the Pakistan government has told the Army in a clear tone that if terrorism is not controlled soon, we will be isolated in the whole world
 sharif ne yah bhi nirdesh diya he ki pathankot hamale kii jaanch jald se jald puri kii jaae or rawalpindi court main dhul-phank rahi mumbai hamalon se judi filon par ection lete hue sunwaayee phir se shuru kii jaae
 Nawaz Sharif, while addressing the UN General Assembly after Sharafat's Hawauri attack, tried to save his life from terrorism by raising the issue of Kashmir, then Pakistan by throwing technical screws through China, terrorist Masood Azhar from the UN Security Council Saved bets played
 lekin bharat or anya padosi mulkon kii ore se saarc sammelan kaa bahishkaar kiye jane ke baad pakistan ko kootneeti ke morche par tagada jhatka laga
 After the surgical strike, anger erupted in the Pakistani people, while the Nawaz Sharif government convened a joint session of Parliament
 is manch se bhi navaj ne ekbar phir kashmir kaa raag alapa or shanti bahaali ke liye baatcheet kaa ronaa royaa
 However, Imran Khan's party boycotted the joint session
 aatankiyon ko iesai kii shahpakistan ke punjab praant ke siem shahbaaj sharif ne iesai par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki aatanki sanghathanon par karrwai karte hi vyavastha main baithe log sakriy ho jate hai
 Shahbaz and ISI chief Rizwan Akhtar also had a bitter debate on this issue
 vahiin, pakistan ke videsh sachiv ejaj choudhary ne kaha ki desh kootnithik taur par alag-thalag ho rahaa he
 The big countries of the world are not paying attention to our words
 bhale hi china ne pakistan ko samarthan diya he, lekin usne pakistan ko apane yahaan bhi badlaav laane kaa sanket diya he
 People on the streets in pok may claim that there is no terrorist camp there
 lekin pioke ke log is jhooth kii pole khol rahe hai
 These days the people of the area are on the streets against Pak rulers and terrorists
 logon ne chetavanee di he ki agar taliban, jaish e mohammad, lashkar e taiyaba or duusare aatanki sanghathanon ke camp sarkaar ne band nahin karwaae to log khud hi camp tabah kar denge
 Locals protested on Thursday against terrorist camps running in different parts of pok
 logon kaa kahana he ki aatanki campon kii vajah se unki jindagi narak jaisi ban gai he
 In this way, despite all the efforts, the crisis of the Sharif government has not been solved
 musiibat to abhi or badhane vaali he
 On the one hand, on the orders of the Nawaz Sharif government, the army and security forces have started a campaign against terrorism but during the similar raids in Faisalabad, the houses of three leaders of Sharif's own party have recovered illegal weapons
 khabar he ki is ghatana ke baad aatank ke khilaaf oparation roak diya gaya he
 Hingoli district, one of the 36 districts of Maharashtra, is located at the northern end of Marathwada in the state
 marathavada kabhi nijaamon ke adheen tha or hingoli tab parabhaani jile kaa taluka hua karata tha
 The city of Hingoli has been witness to two major wars between Tipu Sultan and Maratha in 1803 and between Nagpurkar and Bhadel in 1857
 1999 main bana jila1956 main marathavada ko bombai state main shaamil kiya gaya or 1960 main maharashtra ke rup main nae rajya ke avataran ke baad parabhaani jile ko isamen shaamil kar liya gaya
 On 1 May 1999, Hingoli was carved out of Parbhani district and made a new district
 hingoli kii simaaen uttar main washim or yavatmal
 Parbhani to the west and Nanded to the southeast
 4526 squaire kilometre daayre main faile hingoli jile main 3 pramukh bhashaaen (marathi, hindi or urdu) boli jaati hai
 Cotton is the main crop here
 hingoli jile main 5 tehsil aati hai
 According to the 2011 census, Hingoli district had a population of 11,77,345
 jisamen 6,06,294 purush or 5,71,051 mahilaayein shaamil thim
 According to the 2001 census, the district had a population of 9,87,160
 maharashtra kii kul aabaadi kaa 1
 05 percent of the population lives in this district
 dharm ke aadhaar par kul aabaadi par najar daalen to 73
 Hindus make up 32% of the population, while Buddhists number two and have a population of 15 in the district

 The Hingoli Lok Sabha consists of 6 assembly seats, of which BJP is ruled in Umarkhed and Hingoli, while NCP in Kinwat and Shivagaan in Hadgaon, Vasmat
 iske alaava kalamnuri seat par congress kaa raaj he
 Shiv Sena's occupation of the Lok Sabha and Hemant Patil of Shiv Sena are mps in the Hingoli Lok Sabha seat dominated by the Dalit community
 unhone is saal madhya main hue chunaav main congress ke subhashrav baapuro vankhede ko 2,77,856 maton ke antar se haraaya tha
 Then in this election Hemant Patil got 5,86,312 votes while Wankhede got 3,08,456 votes
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke rajeev saatav chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab hue the
 The interesting thing about this Lok Sabha seat is that it has not been occupied by any party for a long time
 kabhi congress, ensipi to kabhi shivasena ko jeet milti rahi he
 The Bahujan Samaj Party and the Republican Party of India have also interfered in this area and the Congress and Shiv Sena have been spoiling the equation
 philhal haryana ke saath-saath maharashtra main bhi vidhansabha chunaav karaae ja rahe hai
 Votes will be cast in both states on October 21 while election results will be held on October 24

 rajasthan border ke paar pakistan ke sindh praant main hinduon kii aabaadi teji se khatm kii ja rahi he
 The cases of forced conversions of Hindus are constantly coming here
 ravivaar ko bhi ek maamla saamne aayaa he
 According to Hindu Singh Sodha, president of Lok Seemant Sangathan, an organization working for Pakistani Hindu migrants, 500 Hindus are being forcibly converted
 lok seemaant sanghathan ke adhyaksh hindu singh sodha ke anusaar jo log pakistan chhod kar bharat aae the, magar kinhin kaarnon se unhen waapas janaa padaa, un pariwaron ko khaas taur se target kiya ja rahaa he
 In the last 3 years, 1,379 Hindus who have taken refuge in India have had to return to Pakistan
 vahiin nae maamle main 500 hinduon kaa dharm jabaran dharm parivartan kiya ja rahaa he, isamen kai log ve hai jo haal hi main bharat se deport hue hai
 Hindus are being forced into Islam on a large scale in Sindh province of Pakistan on 25 March
 yahaan 500 hinduon ke dharm parivartan ke liye parche bhi baante ja chuke hai
 These include 80-year-old Chandu, his wife Dhami, son Bhagwan, daughter-in-law Dhami and children Dhero, Mumal, Jayaram and Kavita, who were sent on 5 August 17
 rajasthan hoicourt ne chuttee ke din special bench lagaakar inke deport aadesh par ste bhi de diya tha magar aadesh taamil hota usase chand minute pehle unki train pakistan seemaa main pravesh kar gai thi
 Now this family is under pressure to convert to Islam
 hindu singh sodha kaa kahana he ki pakistan kahindu na ghar kaa he na ghat kaa
 There is a compulsion to change religion, there is a threat of livelihood here and the danger of being chased out all the time
 bharat sarkaar visthapit hinduon ke punarvaas ke niyam banaati to he, lekin jila staron par unki paalna nahin hoti
 Therefore, those who are returning have no other way than to change religion
 kai sanghathan kalma padhane waalon ko rahane ke liye afordable ghar, gharelu saamaan, dahej kaa saamaan, kaam karne ke liye silaai mashine, naharon se kheti karne ke liye saal bhar pani kaa pralobhan bhi de rahe hai
 There are more cases of forced conversions in Tharparkar and Umarkot areas

 Shortly after the inauguration, the flight also flew from here to Kolkata

 Good question, answer: Arunachal already had several operational airstrips including Pasighat but till now they did not have punctual civil flight services

 Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that the government has no business staying in the oil business
 pradhan ne telecom or avieshen sector kaa bhi hawala diya jahaan pratispardhaa ke kaaran upabhoktaaon ko kam keemat main suvidhaayen mili hai
 You cannot compare the oil company with telecom and aviation
 vaise donon sector kii haalat karaab he
 The private companies of telecom have to give 1 lakh 42 thousand crore within three months which is not possible
 rojgaar dene vaala yah sector suukh chukaa he
 Companies that gave phones for free have started taking money with other conditions
 bharat sanchaar nigam limited (BSNL) ko barbaad karne main sarkaar kii hi niti thi
 All the blame is being laid on the non-professional manner of the employees
 karmchaaree bhi sochen ki unhone nashe main apni chhavi kitni bigaad lee ki janata main unke liye sahanubhuti hi nahin he
 But today the interview of the managing director of BSL has been published
 wo beasenal ko 4ji die jane ke liye telecom department ko patr likh rahe hai
 BSNL was also ruined for not providing 4G
 agar pratispardhaa kii itani hi chintaa thi to sarkaar ne beasenel ko 4ji kyon nahin diya or iske nahin dene se kis privet company ko zyaada laabh mila? itane aasaan prashn kaa uttar aap khud dhundhen
 Dharmendra Pradhan's statement came before the cabinet meeting to privatize BPCL
 yah baithak is hafte ho sakati he
 This statement states that the public sector oil companies, which have achieved Navratna status, have been caught by the eye of a private sector emperor
 sarkaar ab khul kar nijeekaran karegi
 The overwhelming support of the people of the Hindi state without thinking on Ram temple and Article 370 will encourage it to privatize
 jabaki is sector se bhi log nikaale jaaenge or nai naukariyaan band hone vaali hai
 Recruitment in public sector companies has been reduced or has been discontinued
 maine dekha he ki in companiyon main kaam karne vaale karmchaaree jo saal main ek kitaab tak nahin padhate hai magar bhakthi main pradhanmantri modi kii videsh niti par jhagad rahe the
 Demonetisation was welcomed
 ab in sabhi ko aage aakar nijeekaran ke paksh main raily kerani chahie
 Dharmendra Pradhan's statement should be welcomed because the Modi government can never do wrong
 aaj jab inke adhikari airport yaa stesan par milte hai to mujhe gher lete hai
 They say that there should be no privatization
 isamen bada khel ho rahaa he
 Dharmendra Pradhan should take strong action against such officers
 agar meraa phone record ho rahaa hoga to pataa hi chal jayega ki in companiyon se koun koun mujhase sampark karata he!sabhi ko pataa he ki BPCL privet ho jayega to phayda kis seth ko hoga
 Those who cannot buy a petrol pump in the city with their money, their petrol pumps are seen somewhere on the highway, now they will be seen in the middle city
 sarkaar agar bipisiel main 53
 If you sell 29 percent stake, then obviously it will not be owned by it
 70,000 karod kii zarurat bhi he kyonki arthvyavastha kii haalat ye he ki ab bechakar khaanaa pad rahaa he
 To the common man as well as the government
 mantri ji ko bataanaa chahie ki tel sector main pratispardhaa se daam kaise kam honge? iske kya pramaan hai? kya yah baat kisi adhyayan ke aadhaar par kahi ja rahi he yaa phir is aadhaar par jab har haal main chunaav hamen hi jeetna he to kuch bhi kaho, kya fark padataa he? aam aadmi ke naam par tel companiyon ko bechaa ja rahaa he to aam aadmi ko bhi kuch bataanaa chahie
 Pradhan's statement is that democracy is committed to the common people of the country
 hamen khulepan ke zarie sugam jivan kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga
 Product is important but who is driving it is not important
 aise lagata he ki bipisiel ke bikne ke agle hi din petrol 50 rupee prati litre ho jayega
 Political success calls it
 aap saamne se line main khadi janata ko yah theory bech sakate hai ki aapaki takalifon ko dur karne ke liye tel company ko kisi privet seth ke haathon bech rahe hai
 This statement is printed on the day of demonetisation
 shaayad yah ek tarah se janata ko salaami bhi he ki vah is baar bhi aise faislon ko line main lagakar rashtravaadi samaj legi
 Maybe the minister is right
 mere khyaal se vahi sahi hai
 If the government considers business to get out of every kind of business for two or three business men, then it is its golden age
 kyonki janata bhi ise hi thik samajhati he

 SP BSP alliance: bispi supremeo mayawati (mayawati) ne kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Elections 2019) main yadav vot bispi (BSP) ke paksh main transfar nahin hue hai isliye bispi ab uttar pradesh main 11 siton par hone vaale vidhansabha up chunaav main akele ladegi
 Although BSP supremo Mayawati has not made any formal announcement regarding this decision, but he said this in a meeting with the leaders of his party
 vahiin sapa (SP) ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav (akhilesh Yadav) is samay azamgarh main hai or vahaan raily ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 After this news, it is believed that there has been a rift in the SP BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati (mayawati) kaa yah bayaan aise samay par aayaa he jab samaajawaadee party main is baat kii samiksha ho rahi he ki bispi ke saath gathbandhan par kitna phayda yaa nuksaan hua he
 Significantly, the Samajwadi Party has got only 5 seats in Uttar Pradesh and the BSP, which could not win a single seat in the last election, got 10 seats
 is nattejey ke baad samaajawaadee party main andar hi andar is baat kii charchaa kii thi ki bispi kaa vot sapa ko transfar nahi hui he
 SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had already expressed this apprehension and his point was proved right
 gauratlab he ki basapa ke saath gathbandhan ke baavjood samaajawaadee party ko mahaj paanch siten hi mili hai
 Not only this, the family members of Kannauj, Badaun and Firozabad, which are called the fort of SP, lost the election
 kai logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki gathbandhan ke seat bantwaare main mayawati ne man mutabik siten le leen
 From the tone of exchange of votes, SP was second in 2014 in the 10 seats where the BSP has won
 isi kaaran sapa ko asafalataa mili
 The equation was in favor of SP on Nagina, Bijnor, Shravasti, Ghazipur seats
 doosraa kaaran gathbandhan kii camestry jameen tak nahin pahunchi
 Seeing the crowd in the meetings, he felt that our votes would be transferred to each other
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 "mayawati knew that SP had a good hold on Muslim voters because of Mulayam
 iskaa phayda mayawati ko hua
 Mayawati took the winning seats into her account

 By giving half the seats to another party, the district or block level leaders of that party in that area started seeing their future dark
 " in sabakaa parinaam yah hua ki sapa kaa vot pratishat 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke 22
 This time down from 35 percent to 17
 96 fisadi rah gaya
 The percentage of BSP was also reduced, but its votes were converted into seats

 Overall, if the Samajwadi Party could have taken a decision first, then the BSP supremo has kindly announced to break the relationship with the Samajwadi Party

 is babat buudhvaar ko siem arvind kejariwal ne alji anil baijal se mulaakaat kar unase anumati lee
 After the meeting that lasted for half an hour, Kejriwal did not speak to the media, but by tweeting himself, he informed that permission has been received from LG
 harjane kaa faisla pichley saal hi dilli sarkaar ne kiya tha, lekin us vakt alji se anumati na milane se yah lagu nahin ho paaya tha, lekin is saal garmi badhate hi bijli katautee ke chalate sarkaar ne bijli companiyon ko javabdeh banane ke liye faisle ke saath saath alji se anumati bhi lee
 It is now expected that this decision will be implemented soon
 darasal, dilli sarkaar ne bijli companiyon par do ghante se zyada kii katautee par har ghante ke hisaab se jurmaana lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 In the first two hours, these fines will be given at the rate of Rs 50 and after that Rs 100 per hour in the electricity bill
 tippaniyan According to the verdict, penalty has been fixed under section 108 of the Electricity Act 2003
 iske mutabik, ab do ghante se zyada ke power cat kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 If the transformer has failed, in that case it will have to be rectified within two hours or another option will be taken in 72 hours
 agar power companiyaan aisa karne main naakaam rahati hai to unhen har upabhokta ko pehle do ghanton ke liye 50 rupee or do ghanton ke baad 100 rupee prati ghante kaa jurmaana bharna padegaa

 90 dinon ke andar us bijli company ko jurmaana kii raashi deni hogi
 In this regard, CM Arvind Kejriwal met LG Anil Baijal and took his permission
 aadhe ghante tak chali baithak ke baad kejariwal media se to nahin bole, lekin khud twit karke isaki jaankaree di ki alji se anumati mil gai he
 The Delhi government had decided to pay the compensation last year, but it was not implemented due to not getting permission from LG at that time, but this year with the power cut due to the power cut, the government decided to make the power companies accountable
 Also got permission from LG
 ab ummid kii ja rahi he ki jald hi ye faisla lagu ho jayega
 In fact, the Delhi government has decided to impose penalty on electricity companies on an hourly basis for cuts of more than two hours
 ye jurmaana pehle do ghante main 50 rupee or uske baad 100 rupee prati ghante ke hisaab se graahakon ko bijli bill main hi diya jayega
 The comments faisle ke mutabik, vidyut adhinium 2003 kii dhara 108 ke tahat jurmaana tay kiya gaya he
 According to this, now power cuts of more than two hours will not be allowed
 agar transfarmar fail ho gaya ho to us sthiti main do ghante ke andar ise sudhaarney yaa 72 ghanton main iskaa koi doosraa vikalp nikaalnaa hoga
 If the power companies fail to do so, they will have to pay a penalty of Rs 50 for the first two hours and Rs 100 per hour after two hours
 agar kisi ilaake jiske liye kam se kam 100 ghar ke sab stesan yaa transformar main ai kharabi ko agar do ghante main thik na kiya to bhi graahak ko harjaana bijli companiyon ko dena hoga
 If the fuse of a customer's house blew or the service line was broken and it was not fixed in 3 hours, then electricity companies would pay a compensation of Rs 100 per hour to the customer
 company ko bill main edjust karke harjaana dena hoga
 Within 90 days, the power company will have to pay a fine

 There is an atmosphere of anger in Sri Lanka after the crushing defeat against India
 srilanka ke prashansak apni team kii haar se bilkul bhi khush nahin hai or unhone team ke khilaaf jamkar narebaji kii
 After the defeat of the Sri Lankan team, the fans shouted slogans outside the team bus and said, “return us our cricket
 hamen 1996 jaisi shandaar cricket chahie
 Meanwhile, the police somehow removed the fans and then the players' bus was able to leave from there
 haar par srilanka ke antarim coach nik pothas jab bayaan de rahe the to us samay bhi srilankai samarthak baahar se lagaataar chilla rahe the
 Pothus said, "it's very disappointing
" aap team ko pyaar karte hai or team ke saath jude hote hai
 Bad play of the team also creates anger
 hamane apana sarvshereshth khel nahin dikhaaya
 Anger is evident from the constant defeat
 pothas ne aage kaha, hamaara score ek samay 139 / 1 tha
 But after this we kept losing wickets continuously and within 16 runs we lost the last 6 wickets
 19 overon main hamane 9 wicket khoe
 This is not true at all and cannot be justified
 hamen dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Let us tell you that Sri Lanka's performance has been very poor for the last few months
 team ko pehle zimbabwe ke khilaaf vanade siries main haar mili or iske baad bharat ne test siries main srilanka kaa supada saaf kar diya
 Now in the first match of the 5-match ODI series, the team has also faced defeat
 lagaataar haar se srilankai prashansak team se kaaphi naraj najar aa rahe hai or isi ke kaaran unhone dambula main team ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya
 In the first ODI, India defeated Sri Lanka by 9 wickets and took a 1-0 lead in the series
 rajasthan main cabinet ke gathan ke baad shanivaar ko pehali baar mukhyamantri ashok gahalot cabinet kii baithak lenge
 The special thing is that the Minister of State will also attend this cabinet meeting
 teen din ke dilli daure ke baad der raat laute ashok gahalot ne aate hi ghar par mukhya sachiv dibi gupta samet sabhi adhikariyon ko bulaayaa or karj maafee ko lekar taiyaar masaude par charchaa kii
 The government will present its draft on the debt waiver of farmers in the cabinet today
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki kisaanon ke liye paisa kahaan se aayega or kis tarah se karj maafee hogi
 Let me tell you, during this cabinet meeting, many schemes related to farmers and youth can be announced, so that the BJP can win in the Lok Sabha elections in april-may
 congress ne chunaav main kisaanon kii karj maafee or yuvaaon ke 3500 berogari bhatte dene kii baat kahi thi
 There will be discussion about this
 iske alaava sabhi vibhaagon se 100 din kii kaaryayojna bhi maangi gai he jo ki bataaenge ki kis kis vibhaag main kya-kya jaruri kaam he
 a list of pending recruitments has also been sought from the Education Department
 sarkaar ke liye sabase badi pareshaani kisaanon ke karj maafee ke liye paisa jutanaa he
 12000 crore is needed only for loan waiver from cooperative banks
 iske liye rajasthan sarkaar duusari sansthaaon se lone lene par bhi vichaar kar rahi he
 It is believed that in the cabinet meeting, the decision taken in the last month of the BJP government can be reviewed
 paryaton mantri vishvendra singh ne kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa nayaa paryaton slogan jane kya dikh jaae ko badal kar waapas se padhaaro mhare desh kiya jayega
 Similarly, the way the BJP government made changes in the courses can also be discussed
 pakistan ke sindh praant kii rajdhani karachi main ek sansanikhej ghatnakram main murda jaanwaron ke avshesh se khaadya tel banane kaa maamla prakaash main aayaa he
 a factory has been sealed by the authorities in this connection
 pakistani media main prakashit report ke anusaar, sindh paryaavaran evam sangrakshan agency (esaipie) ne murda pashuon ke avasheshon ko gaiyr vaigyanik tareeke se jalaane ke maamle main ek kaarkaane ko sil kiya he
 The agency's team raided the factory on the instructions of Mutharja Wahab, legal and environmental affairs advisor to the Sindh Chief Minister
 team main shaamil adhikariyon ne bataaya ki kaarkaane main ek bade se kadaahe main mrit pashuon ke avshesh ko jalaakar khaane main istemaal hone vaale tel ko banaae jane kii soochna mili thi
 Nearly 629 girls from Pakistan were groomed and sold to men in China - report officials said the burning of the remains of the dead animals spread stench in the area and the poisonous gas released from it was damaging the environment of the area
 isse nikalne vaale tel ko sthaneey bazaar main bechaa jaataa or isamen nikali vasa ko sabun factriyon ko supplai kiya jaataa tha
 Wahab appreciated the team's action and said that such other illegal activities are also taking place under the protection of the mafia which could endanger the lives of people
 unhone logon se apil kii ki ve is tarah ke sandigdh maamalon kii jaankaree adhikariyon ko den
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be trying to end VIP culture, but his ministers do not agree with this

 The latest case is of Bastar, where the government's sensitivity is greatly needed
 rajya ke shiksha mantri kedaar kashyap isi ilaake se vidhayak hai
 Ambulance continued to run in the pride of the minister
 In Dantewada, the minister was busy for two days in the inauguration and foundation stone of government buildings, buildings and bridges built under government schemes
 mantri ji ke kaaryakam ke liye bataur protocol doembulanceduty par tainaat kar di gayi
 Under the government guidelines, these two ambulances ran from the back of the minister's convoy
 udhar sarkari aspataalon main ambulance ke nadaarad rahane se marijon kaa bura haal hota rahaa
 a 14-year-old schoolboy, who was suffering in waiting for an ambulance, got caught in the current while playing at Geedam in Dantewada
 wo kareeb 55 fisadi tak jhulas chukaa tha
 After giving minor treatment at the Primary Health Center in Geedam, the victim referred the doctor to the Medical College of Bastar
 lekin bachche ko aspataal tak le jane ke liye ghanton ambulance kaa intjaar karnaa padaa
 108 Service i
e
 the ambulance was busy during the visit of the minister
 dantewada jila aspataal kii duusari ambulance kii bhi duty mantri ji ke kaarykram ke tahat unke kafile main daudti rahi
 Doctors raised their hands, citing protocol
 idhar marij ke parijan ke paas itani bhi rakam nahin thi ki wo nijee taur par koi vaahan kiraaye par le saken
 Locals scrambled to provide private vehicles, but could not succeed
 sthaneey logon ne doctoron par banaaya dabaavajab logon ne doctoron ko aade haathon liya to dantewada ke kisi or aspataal se ek ambulance muhaiyaa hui
 Through this, the victim student was sent to Bastar Medical College
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki peedit chaatr bhimraj kareeb teen ghante tak tadapata rahaa
 His condition continued to decline
 yadi sthaneey logon ne doctoron par dabaav nahin banaaya hota to shaayad bhimraj kii jaan bachanaa mushkil tha
 Despite the dismal health services, the two ambulances that the minister got, the doctors posted at Bastar Medical College managed to save her life
 bhimraj abhi bhi isiu main bhartee he
 But on the other hand, the question is being raised about whether the ministers need more ambulance
 wo bhi aise ilaake main jahaan swasth sevaayen jarjar haalat main hai
 Not only this, is not an ambulance sufficient for the dignity and protocol of the Minister, which the officers provided him with two ambulances
 mantri ji ne maamle se munh modoudhar jab is ghatana kii jaankaree shiksha mantri kedaar kashyap ko hui to unhone puure maamle se apana pallaa jhaad liya
 The minister said bluntly why the two ambulances were installed, ask the protocol people
 unhone kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree nahin he
 Not only this, the Minister is neither ready to say anything in front of the camera in this matter nor is ready to negotiate under common courtesy

 Former India captain and current U-19 coach Rahul Dravid believes that Hardik Pandya was able to consolidate his place in the senior team very quickly due to the lack of fast bowling all-rounder in Indian cricket, but he was not a part of his special talent
 Deserves credit for getting the most out of it
 dravid ne kaha ki 'tej gendbaaji olerounder kaa hona bhartiya team ke liye hameshaa mahatvapurn rahaa he or pandya ne maukon kaa puraa phayda uthaaya he
 The 24-year-old Pandya, who specializes in lower-order shots, also bowls well fast and is a regular member of the Indian team in limited-overs cricket
 shaadi main hardik pandya jamkar naache, bhai ne bhi diya stage par saath!pandya ne 2016 main debyue kiya or uske baad 32 vanade or 27 tii-20 antarrashtriya maichon main 35 or 23 wicket liye
 Apart from this, he also played some useful innings
 pitiai ke mutabik dravid ne under-19 world cap team kii ravaanagi se pehle press conference main kaha, ‘hardik apane tallent ke kaaran team main aayaa he
 He is a player who has proved himself and he is someone who has this unique quality
 'dravid ne kaha, 'jab aap bharat main tej gendbaaji olerounder hote ho to phir aapako chunauti dene vaale kam hote hai or yah vaastaviktaa he
 The 'under-19 World Cup will be played in New Zealand from 13 January
 team india kii bhabhi baniin anoushka kaa yuvaraj ne rakhaa nayaa namdravid ne kaha, ‘agar aap is desh main ballebaaj yaa spin gendbaaj ho to chunauti kadi hoti he, kyonki aapako kai anya se pratispardhaa kerani hoti he
 But you can count the fast bowling all-rounder on how many fast bowling all-rounders are playing in India
 ' Addressing around 20,000 'swachhagrahis' at the closing ceremony of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the Champaran Satyagraha, PM Modi said that 8 in Bihar in the last one week

 If you have 15-20 matches before the big tournament starts then that is right but when you have only three matches to prepare for the big tournament then i think you need to keep all the combinations right
 " It is clear from Virat Kohli's statement that Dhoni will provide batting in the lower order
 puri ummid he ki match finishr ke rup main vahi dhoni khelte hue maidan main cricket premiyon ko najar aae
 Revealing about his strategy, he said, "if the top order doesn't work then you only have Mahendra Singh Dhoni left and he has been leading the youth for so long
