 a post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat
 kohli) on Dec 11, 2017 at 7:32am PST It was sad to see that the Chief Justice of the country (CJI) made a passionate appeal to the Prime Minister at a joint conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of the High Court in Delhi on 25 April
 sijei mukademon ke pahaad se nibatane ke liye jajon kii kami kii samasya bayaan karte hue ro pade
 Their suffering can be understood
 justise tii
 s
 thakur ne disambar, 2015 main jab se sijei kaa pad sambhala he, tabhi se ve apane staff or sahakarmiyon ko aage kii chunautiyon ke liye taiyaar karte aa rahe hai or isse sambandhit duusare logon yani centre or rajya sarkaron ke alaava vakeelon se bhi sahyog kii ummid kar rahe hai
 Unfortunately, the central government is still unable to recover from the injury caused by the judiciary to reject the NJAC Act and to maintain the infamous collegium system for appointment of judges
 donon pakshon kii ore se manjuur prakriya ke sanshodhit gyaapan ko hasil karnaa aasaan nahin he or yah prakriya bhavishya main gadabadi bhi paidaa kar sakati he
 The CJI cited two main reasons for the delay in the lawsuits: the refusal of lawyers to give up their holidays, and the state governments' hesitation in increasing the number of judges and courts according to a 2005 Supreme Court ruling under which the lower judiciary functions 
 bahut se rajyon ko lagata he ki nyaaypalika se rajya ko koi aamadani nahin hoti he, isliye ve us par paisa kharch karnaa nahin chaahate hai
 In a recent meeting of the Central Government's National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms, it was revealed that many states have drastically reduced the expenditure on court administration in the last 3-4 years
 duusari taraf kuch rajyon ne nyaayalay shulk or aarthik dandon ke jariye apane nivesh kii raashi ko doguna kar diya
 a state has spent only 4 crores in a year
 kharch kiye the, lekin nyaay prashasan ke jariye 203 karod ru
 Deposited
 agar yah jaankaree mukademon se jude logon tak pahunchaa di jaae to ve apane rajyon ke khilaaf ladaai shuru kar denge or rajnatikon ko baar-baar samajhane ke mushkil kaam se sijei ko mukt kar denge
 While increasing the number of courts and judges is a desirable solution, the system and sub-system in the judiciary delays lawsuits
 is taraf na hi karypalika or na hi nyaaypalika kii taraf se koi dhyaan diya gaya he
 Delay is inherent in the adversarial model of litigation, as built into the Civil Procedure Court, the Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act
 isliye bahut se deshon ne vivaadon ke samaadhaan ke liye gaiyr-virodhatmak vyavastha ko apanaaya he or maamalon ko mukademe ke bina hi aapasi baatcheet ke jariye nibatane ke liye kah diya he
 Although India amended its laws about 10 years ago, it had asked for civil cases to be resolved through arbitration but no attempt was made to reduce the cases listed for regular cases
 iske liye jaj or vakil hi jimmedaar hai
 It is clear that we are running the system of the 21st century from the structure of the 20th century and the mindset of the 19th century
 jaraa family court, juvenil justise board or gram nyaayalayon par najar daalen-ye sabhi vishesh adaalatein hai jo gaiyr-virodhatmak faislon or aasaan prakriya ke jariye vivaadon ko teji se nibatane ke liye bani hai
 Parliament has also made rules to eliminate the presence of lawyers in them
 phir bhi zyaadaatar adaalatein ansulajhe mukademon ke boj se dabi hai, jiske kaaran bahuton ko niyamit adaalaton kii sharan main janaa pad rahaa he
 When resources are limited, work is organized according to the principle of priority and management
 lekin nyaaypalika main puraane mukademon ko or bhi purana bana diya jaataa he or nae maamalon par sunwaayee shuru kar di jaati he
 Judges trained in one type of cases are transferred to such courts for which they are not well trained
 un par prashasnic jimmedaariyaan bhi thope di jaati hai, jiske kaaran ve adalati kaaryon ke liye paryaapt samay nahin de pate hai
 The intelligent management of courts and lawsuits requires a reliable and up-to-date information on the status and proceedings of the agenda on a daily basis
 is kaam ko aadhunik takanic ke bina kabhi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Although some courts are moving in that direction, many courts are still functioning without technical support
 deree ke liye jimmedaar ek bada mudda he, jiske bare main netaa or jaj baat karne se bachate hai, vah he “baar” main sudhaar laana
 Organized like a pyramid, superstars, lawyers monopolize all litigation lawsuits and do not want to cooperate with the courts, as they are expected to be present in multiple courts at the same time
 ve kisi na kisi bahaane sthagan kii maang karte hai or isaki vajah se mukademon main deree hoti he
 Even when they can do their work through written advocacy, they still do not — perhaps to appease their issues and justify the hefty fees
 baar counsilein, jo vakeelon ko anushaasit kar sakati hai, yaa to udasin bani rahati hai yaa phir ve khud bhi is lut main shaamil rahati hai
 The government has not taken any steps towards reforming the lawyer law to make them professional
 sijei ne sahi kaha haih iske liye sirf jaj hi jimmedaar nahin hai
 Government and lawyers are no less responsible for the collapsing building of justice
 lekhak enelesaiu, bangaluru or enujees, kolkata ke sansthaapak visi rahe hai AIADMK Secretary General VK Sasikala does not seem to be getting the cm's chair at present
 tamilnadu ke rajyapal vidyasagar raav unhen mukhyamantri pad kii shapath dilaane ke paksh main nahin hai
 Citing the rules, the governor said that Sasikala could not be invited for the oath
 is bich khabar thi ki rajyapal ne tamilnadu ke ghatnakram par 3 pannon kii report kii kendriya grih mantralay main ko bheji he
 But later the Principal Secretary to the Governor denied this news
 shashikala ne guuruuvaar ko vidhayakon ke samarthan vaali chitthee saunpte hue sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 At the same time, Panneerselvam also met the Governor and said that the mlas should be in his favor
 vahiin shashikala ke shapath grahan par jari anischitata ke bich tamilnadu ke sattarudh annadramuk main shuukravaar ko kalah or bad gai kyonki jahaan unhone priscedium adhyaksh i madhusudan ko barkhaast kar diya
 Madhusudan wrote a letter to the Election Commission for not recognizing him as the AIADMK general secretary
 is bich shashikala ne kaha ki hamaara vishwaas he ki rajyapal samvidhan or loktantr ko akshunn rakhenge
 Sasikala appointed former minister KA Sengottayan as the new President of AIADMK
 jabaki madhusudan kaa kahana he ki shashikala dwaara mujhe annadramuk se baahar nikaalane se pehle hi maine unhen nishkasit kar diya tha
 Sengottayan was relieved of the post of organization secretary of the party, he was appointed the organization secretary last week
 madhusudanan ne guuruuvaar ko panniraselvam ko apana samarthan diya tha or kaha tha ki vah party kii raksha karnaa chaahate hai
 He had said that everyone should join hands with Panneerselvam to protect AIADMK
 madhusudan kaa tark he ki shashikala 31 march, 2012 main hi annadramuk main phir shaamil huin, jis vajah se vah mahasachiv banane kii paatrata nahin rakhti hai
 Meanwhile, a section of AIADMK mlas denied the Panneerselvam faction that they had been held hostage at a particular place
 is varg ne kaha ki vah swatantra he
 Legislator VC Arukuti, a supporter of Panneerselvam, had said, 'it is difficult to reach the mlas, they have been held hostage

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an interview to Doordarshan on Monday, retaliated on this allegation of opposition
 piem modi ne kaha ki desh beete 40 saal se aatankwak kaa dansh jhel rahaa he, hamaare anginat jawan shahid ho gaye
 What do we think for the martyred soldiers, should it not be an election issue? If farmers die in the country, then the issue of elections but if the soldiers die, then how can this happen? Referring to the problem of Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that this problem was during the time of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country
 Is stuck with kya uskaa hal nikaalane kii koshish kii? hamane 70 saal tak ek rasta pakadaa lekin parinaam nahin niklaa to nayaa rasta apnaanaa padegaa
 So, we have made a special plan on Section 370 or Section 35A

 In this corporate world, we worry a lot about the falling rupee, inflation
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki lambey samay main jo cheez is mulk ko barbaad karegi, vah he mahilaon ke prati hamaara vyavhaar
 ”says Devyani Ghosh, managing director of sales and marketing at Intel South Asia
 intel duniya kii nami ity company he
 What does it mean to be a successful business woman sitting on a high position in a country like India, Ghosh describes it in her own words
 unke hone or banane kii kahani unheen kii jabaani—kaise dekhtaa he striyon ko yah mulnagar kisi desh main vahaan kii aadhi aabaadi kii koi aawaaj nahin he or unhen barabari kii najar se nahin dekha jaataa to vah mulk kabhi pragati nahin kar saktaa
 Today the biggest problem of this country is that we do not consider women as human beings
 akhbaar se lekar televijan or bollywood cinema tak hamen yahi bataata he ki ek stri ke jivan kaa antim lakshya shaadi karnaa or bachche paidaa karnaa he
 This country is based on exploitation of half the population by the rest of the population
 agar kisi desh ke log vahaan kaa sabase bada strot yaa sansaadhan hai to aadhi aabaadi ko damb banaakar kya ham apane desh kaa 50 fisadi sansaadhan kam nahin kar rahe hai
 Perhaps this was said by Warren Buffett, which i am referring to again in simple terms, "as a boy grows up, the roof of his sister's accomplishments becomes brother's land
 ” is desh kaa sach yahi he
 In my childhood, i was born and brought up in a large joint family
 mere 12 chachere bhai the
 i spent my childhood in different parts of Africa and Europe
 maine saat skulon main padhai kii
 After growing up, i realized what a benefit it was to have such a nomadic life
 har baar nae skool main, nai jagah, nae logon ke bich main ek bahari ajanabi kii tarah jaati thi
 i had to take the first step to make my place there
 in chizon se aapke bheetar ek aatmavishvaas paidaa hota he
 At the same time we also get to know how many different colors humans have in the world, different colors of culture, food and traditions
 hindustan ke baahar palane-badaae kaa kaaphi phayda bhi hua
 i spent more than half of my life outside and it plays a big role in the place i am today
 aaj bharat main bhi bahut-si safal mahilaayein hai, lekin ve aaj bhi behad kam hi hai
 In my childhood, my father had taught me that i can do whatever i want
 ab mere liye sawaal sirf yah tha ki main vah chaahati hum yaa nahin
 Work for women Why is Intel a great company? Because there is no gender or gender role here
 maine emb karne ke baad 18 saal pehle yah company jwoin kii thi
 Nobody knew about Intel in 1996
 har koi yah sunakar thodaa chakit hua tha, lekin mere intel jwoin karne ke peeche ek vajah thi
 My interview was taken by a woman named Debra Conrad
 ve kamaal kii stri thim or ab ve hamaari marketing pramukh hai
 This was the only interview where i was not asked any questions about my marriage plans
 yah bhi nahin poocha gaya ki mujhe bachche chahie yaa nahin
 He asked me only one question, "what are your dreams and what are you going to do with those dreams?" And then i realized that this place is made for me
 intel main ham mahilaon ke liye koi vishesh yojanaayen nahin banatin
 As a managing director, i do not care about women's rights here
 hamaari koshish he yahaan ek aisa maahaul bananaa, jahaan mahilaon ke liye kaam or kamyaabi ke avasar baraabar hon
 Apart from hiring women, our entire focus is on them
 ham tamaam chizon ke jariye unke bheetar aatmavishvaas bharne kii koshish karte hai ki ve bhi is baat ko sweekaar karen ki ve purushon ke baraabar hai
 Because especially in a country like India it happens that most of the times women keep themselves behind because they grow up with the belief that they are inferior to men
 behatar varkar hai mahilaayenstriyaan chaahe bos hon yaa karmchaaree, unhen purushon ke mukaable doguna parishram karnaa padataa he or apni kaabiliyat ko zyada sabit karnaa padataa he
 Actually nothing is easy for women
 chaahe ham kitni bhi safalataa kyon na hasil kar len, hamen purushon ke baraabar paise bhi nahin milte
 This thing applies to the whole world
 mere paas ise sabit karne ke liye dheron aankade hai
 Women ceos from all the top levels of the world get 17% less salary than their male counterparts
 kya yah kabhi badalegaa? shaayad jab or mahilaayein oonche padon par pahunchengi
 People generally think that a woman will be delicate and simple, but this is not true
 jarurat padane par ve purushon se zyada ugr or talkh ho sakati he
 In a state of pressure, women work more calmly and coolly
 maa, patni, beti kii vividh bhoomikaayen nibhaane ke kaaran unhen multi tasking kii aadat hoti he
 It is in our DNA only
 jab main peeche mudakar intel main apane kariyar kii taraf dekhati hum to mujhe bahut hairaani hoti he
 When i had just started work, one of my mentors said, "you are young
" tumhaare paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he
 You can try everything
 ” isliye maine har kaam kiya, cells se lekar marketing tak
 This gave an opportunity to know and learn all the dimensions of a business
 aaj jab main bijness skool or iiem main lacture dene ke liye jaati hum to mujhe yah dekhakar aashcharya hota he ki aaj yuvaaon ko lagata he ki safalataa kaa rasta bilkul sidhaa he
 But if you look at the career graph of the most successful people, you will find that their career graph has always been full of ups and downs
 mere liye yah jivan kii badi sikh he
 i am childless of my own choice
 i come from a joint family, where there are many children, nieces and nephews
 isliye mujhe kabhi yah jarurat hi mahasoos nahin hui ki main apane khud ke bachche paidaa karun
 But many times people start making decisions about me on this basis
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki main bahut mahatvakankshi hum, isiilie mere paas shaadi karne or apane bachche paidaa karne ke liye vakt nahin he
 But those people do not understand one thing that being unmarried does not mean that you do not have a family
 shaayad main kisi vivaahit vyakti se zyada hi apane parivaar ke saath vakt bitaati hum
 We grow up with such an understanding about women that they should be perfect in every task, while this is not possible
 mujhe is baat se bilkul fark nahin padataa ki log kya kehete hai or kya nahin kehete
 Yes, i am ambitious
 desh main shauchalay se adhik mandir hone kaa bayaandekar vivaad khadey karne ke kuch hi din baadakendriya mantri jairam rameshne mahilaon se un pariwaron main shaadi karne se inkaar karne kii apil kii, jahaan shauchalay nahin hai
 Addressing the local people in Khajuri village near Kota, Union Rural Development and Water and Sanitation Minister Ramesh said, 'do not marry in a family where there is no toilet
 yani shauchalay nahin, to dulhan nahin
 'most of the people he was addressing were women
 'shaadi se pehle len shauchalay kii jaankaree'unhone kaha, ‘aap shaadi se pehle nakshatron kii anukulata jaanane ke liye rahu-ketu aadi ke bare main jyotishi se poochhate hai
 When you are deciding to get married, then you should also check whether the groom has a toilet in his house
 ’ baad main ramesh ne kota jile ke ek chote shahar sangoud main nirmal bharat yatra ke tisare sanskaran kaa shubharambh kiya
 He cited the slogan 'no toilet if not bride' given by Haryana government to promote sanitation there
 bhaashan ke dauraan diya misalramesh ne anita naire kii kahani kaa zikr kiya, jo madhya pradesh main shaadi hone ke do din baad hi sasuraal main shauchalay nahin hone par pati kaa ghar chhodkar waapas chali gayi
 He said that cleanliness is an issue related to the dignity and safety of women and the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan is a mass movement, which aims to eradicate the practice of open defecation in ten years
 unhone logon ko paryaapt swatchta suvidhaayen uplabdh nahin karaane ko lekar rajasthan sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Ramesh's opposition to the controversial statement said that out of 9,177 gram panchayats in the state, only 321 were free from open defecation
 unhone prashasan se rajya ko paanch saal main khule main shouch se mukt banane ke liye ek yojana taiyaar karne ke liye kaha
 Meanwhile, members of the saffron organizations showed black flags to Ramesh in connection with the statement regarding the temple and the toilet
 mantri ne haal hi main kaha tha ki desh main shauchalay se adhik mandir he
 This statement gave a befitting look to right-wing Hindu organizations
 mumbai ke rahane vaale captain amol yadav ne ek aisa karnama kar dikhaaya he, jise puraa karnaa to dur iske bare main soch bhi nahin pate
 Amol made a plane on the roof of his house and now he will also be able to fly it
 saal 2011 main bane is plane ke registration kaa intjaar kar rahe amol ko maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne unhen dijisie kaa certificate saunpa he
 Amol, who was the deputy chief pilot at Jet Airways, has spent 19 years working hard on the roof of the house to create the aircraft TAC-003
 aircraft 2011 main ban gaya tha or ab amol certificate paane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Explain that Amol works on the post of Deputy Chief Pilot in Jet Airways
 mazdooree kar parivaar paalataa he ye khilaadi, de chukaa he kai yuvaaon ko trainingkele kaam karte hue amol ne 6 seat vaala aircraft banaaya he or ab wo aadhikarik rup se ise uda bhi sakate hai

 Advertisement by Pakistan on the 10th anniversary of the 9 / 11 terror attack in America's leading daily newspaper The Wall Street Journal has not pleased the readers
 pathakon ne is vigyaapan ko majaak qaraar dete hue sawaal uthaaya he ki ek aisa desh aatankwaad se peedit hone kaa daawa kaise kar saktaa he ki jahaan khoonkhaar aatankwaadi osama bin laden varshon tak surakshit chupa rahaa
 a half-page advertisement in the blog The Threat Matrix of the Long War Journal gave readers feedback
 isamen aatankwaad ke khilaaf vaishvik yuddh par vishleshan or reporting par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Written in one of dozens of comments on this blog, it is quite ridiculous
 ve badi sankhya main maujuud aatankwaadi sanghathanon kaa khaatmaa karke vishwa kii shanti ke liye bahut kuch kar sakate hai
 Another reader commented that it would be better if you curb the Taliban, al-qaeda sympathizer ISI and then attack organizations using heavy weapons
 vigyaapan main pakistan kii purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii tasviir chhapi he or pakistan ne poocha he, koun sa desh aapaki shanti ke liye zyada kaam kar saktaa he
 The advertisement gives figures of bomb blasts which include assassination plans against Pakistan's leaders, public and soldiers
 isamen kaha gaya ki 18 karod kaa desh duniya ke saat arab logon ke bhavishya ke liye lard rahaa he
 Another reader wrote that no explanation has been given so far about Osama bin Laden or the Haqqani network or Quetta Shura, who have lived a comfortable life for a decade
 ek anya tippanee main kaha gaya ki ek desh jo vaishvik aatankwaad kaa kendra he, jiske khilaaf 1980 ke dashak se aatankwaadi prashikshan shivi chalaane ke saboot hai, jo nato sainikon kii hatya karne vaale afgaan taliban ko sangrakshan detaa he, vah aatankwaad se peedit hone kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 After the post poll results, now that it seems certain that the Congress is going to be swept in the Lok Sabha elections, the preparations are being made to sabotage someone's head
 rahul gandhi ke virdohi or media kaa ek section rahul gandhi ko iske liye jimmedaar bataane main juta hua he
 They say that they are responsible for this evil defeat
 duusari ore party ke netaa isaki samuhik jimmedaari lene koaatur hai
 Critics of Rahul believe that he neither showed the sincerity nor the strategy which is necessary for this Mahasangram
 unamem kaaphi kamiyaan raheen or ve sahi samay par koi bada kadam nahin uthaa paae
 His style was similar to that of guerrilla warriors and hence he lost in face-to-face battles
 iske vipareet unke samarthak kehete hai ki isamen unka koi dosha nahin, ve to raajnneeti main nae hai
 It is not fair to blame them and they are not responsible for it at all
 to phir sachai kya he? yah baat to chunaav kii ranbheri bajte hi saaf ho gai thi ki sonia gandhi ne ek stretiji ke tahat hi rahul gandhi ko party kaa piem candidet nahin banaaya tha
 He feared that if the party loses, Rahul will be considered responsible for this and this will have an impact on his future
 unhen congress ke sheersh netaa ke taur par to project kiya gaya lekin piem candidet shabd se parhez kiya gaya
 But now it seems that this was a wrong move
 unhen piem candidet ke taur par hi utaara janaa chahie tha or tab party main ek thos netritv dikhataa jisaki is chunaav main kaaphi kami khali
 In fact, a specialty of the Congress has been that its leaders and workers are always eyeing the top leadership and take power from there
 unhen lagata he ki shaktistrot gandhi parivaar hi he
 In such a situation, they keep showing their strength to them
 unhen isamen phayda dikhataa he or lagata he ki is rajbhakti kaa unhen pratidaan milegaa
 They apply their full strength to get this grace
 pichley dedh dashakon se congress ke tamaam netaaon kii vafadari janata kii ore kam or 10 janpath kii ore zyada rahi
 Many people will remember that last year, Rahul Gandhi had told his mps elected from UP that they should spend more time in their constituencies than in Delhi, but all of them ignored
 uskaa fal ve to is baar bhugtenge hi, party bhi bhugtegi
 In fact, everyone wanted to become the kind person of Rahul Gandhi, but no one wanted to follow the path given by him
 yah haalat sirf upi kii nahin thi, har rajya main aisa hua
 Instead of being with the public, big leaders of Congress and most mps camped in Delhi or big cities
 yani janata se dur
 There is a saying in the marketing world that what it sees is sold
 yah baat ab chunavi raajnneeti main bhilagu hoti he
 If most of the party's mps failed to meet the expectations of the people, then what is Rahul Gandhi's fault in this? bollywood ke sitare amitabh bachchan, lata mangeshkar, anil kapur, priyanka chopra sahit anya shakhsiyaton ne apane prashansakon ko id par mubaarakabaad di or aashaa vyakt kii ki yah saal sewai kii mithaas, khushiyonor shanti se bharaa hoga

 While Rohit Sharma was given a chance in the first two Tests in the middle order, in the third Test
 lokesh rahul ko utaara gaya
 In both the tests, Rohit Sharma did not do anything special, then Rahul also disappointed
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya ke
 Rahul should be given a second chance or Rohit Sharma should be taken back in the playing eleven or he should be played on the bench
 flop rahe hai rohit sharmarohit sharma ne edilade test main 43 or 6 jabaki bristben test main 32 or 0 banaae
 Team India scored 444 and 315 in Adelaide while 408 and 224 in Brisbane
 team ke bade score banane ke baavjood sharma bada score nahin bana sake
 Rohit Sharma, having scored a century in the first two Tests after making his Test debut in 2013, had raised hopes that he could be an option for Rahul Dravid in the middle order but his innings played since then have mostly disappointed him
 test main unka ausat he to 40
 71 But out of the 16 innings played, the last 9 innings have been very weak
 pichhali 9 pariyon main rohit ne 19, 0, 31 (note out), 28, 6, 43, 6, 32, 0 ran kii paariyaan kheli hai
 Ie 20
 63 kii ausat se kul 165 ran
 The funny thing is that if Rohit's first two innings are removed, then he 21 in the remaining 14 innings
 69 kii ausat se ran banaae hai
 Will Rahul get another chance? Due to this performance of Rohit, Mahendra Singh Dhoni did the Melbourne Test
 rahul ko aajamaaya
 The Karnataka opener Rahul was playing his first Test and it was clear from the way he was out that he was nervous
 rahul ko kabhi gharelu pich par team india kii ore se khilne kaa mauka nahin mila or na hi unhen vanade main utaara gaya
 Anyway, even the biggest batsman gets nervous while playing the first match at the international level and something similar happened with Rahul
 pehali pari (3 ran) main out hone se thik pehle vaali gend par unka kaich chhot gaya lekin unhone duusare hi ball par phir se gend ko pul karne kii koshish kii or kaich de baithe
 Similarly, in the second innings (1 run), he was caught in the slip of Mitchell Johnson to pull the ball
 pradarshan ke lihaaj se rahul acha to nahin khele lekin pehla test hone ke vajah se unhen doosraa mauka jarur diya janaa chahie
 At the forefront of the race, Raina is now the third contender for the middle order, Suresh Raina
 raina kaa vanade main pradarshan kaabile tarif rahaa he lekin test main wo kuch khaas nahin kar sake hai
 Raina has played 17 Tests and 28 in this
 44 kii ausat se 768 ran banaae hai
 Raina, who has scored a century in the first Test of his career, has also scored only one century and 6 half-centuries in 29 innings
 unka test kariyar khatme kii ore tha
 But after the defeat in the Test series in England last year, the team won the ODI series due to Raina's performance
 isse selectors kaa unamem ek baar phir vishwaas jaagaa
 He also joined the team's director Ravi Shastri, who then praised his game
 raina ko ne keval australian daure ke liye chunaa gaya balki bisisiai ne viraat kohli or mahendra singh dhoni ke saath unhen grad ‘e’ cricketron main bhi shumaar kiya
 Not only this, he is also fit under Kohli's aggressive captaincy
 australian daure par raina pichley teen test se apni baari kaa intjaar karte aa rahe hai
 To win in Sydney, the middle order will have to run on the pitch
 team india kaa madhyakram ladkadaaya hua he or aise main kohli kii najar main rohit or rahul ke vikalp ke taur par nishchit hi suresh raina honge
 That is, after 30 months, Raina has the chance to play the Test once again

 Amrit Ranjan, studying in class seven at Pune DPS, has reviewed Chetan Bhagat's new book 'half Girlfriend'
 yah rivyuu hamane prabhaat ranjan ke saahitiyik blog 'janakipul' se liya he
 This was my first Chetan Bhagat book and probably the last one
 chetan bhagat, main aapaki buraai yaa kuch, nahin kar rahaa lekin is kitaab kii kahani kya he? ek ladkaa tha madhav, ek ladki thi riya
 Madhav wanted something more than friendship
 lekin riya bas ek dost bananaa chaahati thi
 While reading the entire book, i felt that Sir Chetan Bhagat was just pulling this story
 kahani ke masaale main upanyaas
 While i was in the middle of the book, a place came up where Sir Chetan Bhagat has praised himself, which he did when Riya was telling Madhav to learn English
 unhone riya se bulawaaya ki use angreji kii aasaan kitaaben padhani chahie jaise ki lekhak chetan bhagat kii kitaaben
 i laughed a lot at this point, in my own book, my drums
 vah apane naam kii jagah arnest hemingve yaa charles dicans yaa kisi kaa naam le sakate the
 i found one thing very bad in this book
 ladkaa angreji nahin jaanata, hindi main baat karata he
 What is wrong with this thing? Her heart, her language, all that girl changes
 chetan bhagat ko hindi kii taraf apni naav kii disha khinchni chahie thi
 Yes i agree that there are English writers but still, Indians
 jo chetan bhagat ke prashansak hai, maaf kijiega
 Now i come to the good things of the book
 madhav ke dost jo use salaah dete hai vah mujhe bahut 'sachhee' lagi
 My friends also give me similar advice so that i always stand in front of the principal's office
 madhav bihar kaa ek sidhaa-sada ladkaa he jo bas padhane aayaa tha
 But on the very first day, he caught sight of a beautiful girl and he stared at her
 ek din us ladki ko madhav apane hostel main le aayaa
 He told this to his friends and they started asking him questions about what he did to the girl
 isi se sari kahani shuru hui or khatm us din hui jab riya ke saath vah kuch karnaa chahta tha or riya ne manaa kar diya or madhav ne gusse main aakar kaha, 'detii he to de varanaa cat le
 'their relationship broke up after that day
 riya kii shaadi jaldi ho jaati he, na chaahate hue bhi use landan ke rohan se shaadi kerani padati he jo riya ko bahut sataata he
 On the other hand, Madhav just kept studying
 kahani kaa doosraa hissaa madhav ke bihar lautne kaa he
 Due to his mother, he returns to Bihar
 phir skool main toilet facility ke liye gates foundation ko bulaata he
 The emphasis on the toilet is very much visible in the story, i do not know why? And to speak in that function, he goes to Patna to learn English
 jahaan uskaa saamana riya se hota he
 Madhav again tried the same way that he would somehow get Riya
 dilli-bihar ke baad america bhi kahani main aata he
 i finally liked where Riya and Madhav get married and have a son
 madhav or riya use basketbaal khelnaa sikhaa rahe hote hai
 His son tries hard and finally gives up
 lekin madhav use kahata he ki safal hote rahane ke liye lagaataar koshish karnaa hota he
 i did not understand one thing
 is kitaab se kya sikh milti he? koshish karte rahanaa, lekin madhav ne kis cheez kii koshish kii
 Repeat this in your mind

 Cheteshwar Pujara is not known for scoring fast runs, but the slow pitch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground also troubled the number three batsman, who batted solidly in the first innings of the third cricket Test against Australia here

 "every batsman has to play a lot of balls to score runs on this pitch," Pujara said
 agar koi or wicket hota to itani sari gend khilne ke baad main shaayad 140 se 150 ran bana letaa
 But in Test cricket it is important to read both the position and the pitch while batting
 ’ unhone sweekaar kiya ki pich par ballebaaji karnaa behad mushkil he or unki team ne jo ran banaae hai ve austrailia ko chunauti lene ke liye paryaapt hai
 The right-handed batsman said, "it's a difficult pitch to score
 agar ham pehle do din dekhen, to kaaphi kam ran bane or is tarah se main kahuunga ki din main 200 ran bananaa mushkil kaam he, isliye mujhe lagata he ki hamane paryaapt ran banaae hai

 Therefore, he cancels this order

 Such a supreme abode of faith is built at an altitude of five thousand feet, where even today the mark of the wind Hanuman is found
 ji haa, baat aise dham kii jahaan pahunchnaa behad mushkil he lekin jo koi yahaan pavanputra ke darshan kaa saubhaahgya praapt kar letaa he, uski koi ichha baaki nahin rahati
 This place is also important because it was here that the children entered the mouth of Hanuman, the sun god illuminating the world
 jameen se paanch hajaar feet kii oonchai par bana hua he sankatmochan kaa ye dham
 This place speaks to the sky, tells the story of Anjaniputra's strength, his greatness, his devotion
 anjaneriparvat par maa anjani or hanuman ke darshan karne aane waalon ko yaheen dikhataa he wo chamatkaar jo lakhon karodon saal pehle hua tha
 But his signs still exist to surprise the devotees
 ji haa yahaan paanv ke aakaar jaisaa dikhne vaala ek sarovar he, jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki ye bal hanuman ke pairon ke dabaav se bana he
 The story is about the time when Anjaniputra was very young
 maa chaahe jitna khaane ko de, unki bhukh shant hi nahin hoti thi
 Once, he saw Suryadev shining in the sky from here
 surkh laal suraj ko dekh unhen laga ye koi fal he, phir kya ek pair jameen par dabaa kar unhone jor se chalaang lagaai or us fal ko muhan main dabaa liya
 Suryadev went to Hanuman's mouth and darkness enveloped the world
 kehete hai ki tab suraj ko hanuman ke muhan se nikaalane ke liye indra ne unki thodi par waar kar diya jisase suryadev ko to mukti mil gai lekin unki thodi tut gai
 This is why he was named Hanuman
 anjaneriparvat par bana ye sarovar aaj bhi us ghatana kii yaad dilaataa he
 Devotees who come to see Darshan of Anjani and Sankatmochan do not return without taking a dip in this lake
 ye manyata he ki iske pani ko choona bajrangbali ke charan sparsh karne ke baraabar he
 On Anjaneri Parvat, Mother Anjani and Hanuman ji have daily Aarti in the morning in which devotees come from far and wide to participate
 yahaan pahunchane kaa rasta mushkil jarur he lekin anjaniputra ke darshan maatr se dur ho jaati he bhakton kii thakaan
 Devotees sit together and recite for 11 days to please God
 bajrangbali kii puja or mahima gaan jitna jaruri he utana hi mahatvapurn he aradhy prabhu ram ke naam kaa paath
 By doing this, God quickly gets pleased and gives the desired groom
 anjaneriparvat par hanuman kii veerta kii kahaniyaan bikhri padi hai to vahiin jharkhand ke gumla jile se bhi he sankatmochan kaa naata
 It is said that Gumla was a child of Pawanaputra, where Anjani spent a large part of her life
 yahaan maujuud mata anjani or hanuman kii nishaniyaan aaj bhi bhakton ko abhibhoot kar detii hai
 Situated amidst Biyaban forests in Jharkhand, the place where Anjaniputra Hanuman sits on his mother's lap
 ye bhoomi kahati he kahani mata anjani ke tap kii
 Mata Anjani found a son like Hanuman by doing harsh penance on this ground
 jharkhand main ranchi se kareeb 140 kimi
 Sankatmochan is seen in the lap of his mother amidst dense forests in Gumla district
 lekin biabaan jangalon ke bich bhakton ke bhakt hanuman ke darshan ke liye pahunchnaa behad mushkil or himmat bharaa kaam he kyonki ye ilaaka behad durgam or yatayaat ke sadhano se dur he
 But whoever succeeds in seeing Hanuman with the devotee Mother Anjani, gets unlimited peace and energy here
 kehete hai ki ye sthaan hanuman kaa nanihaal he
 His mother Anjani was born and raised here and later he did penance here to get rid of the curse
 yahaan ke logon kii maane to is ilaake main kareeb 360 sarovar or 360 shivlinga maujuud hai
 During her tenacity, Mata Anjani lived amidst the thick forests and bathed in new ponds daily and worshiped different Shivalingas
 puraanon ke anusaar mata anjani ko shraap tha ki wo kunvaari maa banengi
 For this reason, he chose such a wild forest where no man-shadow could be cast upon him
 unki ghor tapasya se prasann hokar hi bholenath ne unke garbh se gyarahave rudra avatar hanuman ke rup main janm lene kaa vardaan diya tha
 Apart from this, there is another story related to this place, that too of Hanuman's mother, Anjani
 kehete hai ki mata anjani purv janm main devraj indra ke darbar main apsara punjiksthala thim
 She was very beautiful and playful by nature
 ek baar apni chanchalta main hi unhone ek tejasvi rishi ke saath abhadrata kar di
 Angry, the sage cursed Punjikasthala to go and become a monkey with a monkey-like nature
 rishi ke shraap ko sunakar punjiksthala rishi se kshamaa yachana maangane lagi
 Then the sage said that that form of yours will also be extremely stunning
 tumse ek aise putr kaa janm hoga jisaki kirti or yash se tumhaara naam yugon-yugon tak amar ho jayega
 This was the place where Anjani was blessed with a heroic son like Hanuman
 manyata he ki yahaan aane se or maa anjani sang hanuman ji ke darshan maatr kar lene se bhakton kii sari muraadein puri ho jaati hai
 Especially those who wish to have children, definitely get the blessings of Mata Anjani and Pawanaputra
 mata anjani kii god main baithe shishu hanuman ke darshan to aapane kar liye
 Now let's go to Jaipur, where Bajrangbali defeats misery in child currency; Sankatmochan in this temple especially suffers the suffering of children
 mana jaataa he ki yahaan aane ke baad bacchon ko kabhi koi dukh chhu bhi nahin paata

 raajnneetik udaseenta ke daur main aam aadmi party kii jeet achchhai kii jeet he
 We have also heard stories that show the importance and importance of caste equations
 ye bhi hamen kai-kai baar bataa diya gaya he ki raajnneeti main dhan or baahubal kaa mahatv he, eemaandaaree or paardarshita kaa nahin
 It is also said that politics is not for good people
 hamaare desh kaa chunavi itihaas aisi misaalon se pata hua he ki kaise achche ummidavaar haarane ke liye ellection main khadey hote hai
 Such examples in the political history of this country always prevented good people from coming into politics
 lekin apane pehle hi chunaav main vyapak jansamarthan hasil karne vaali aam aadmi party ne is paramparaagat rujhaan ko badal daalaa he or phir se rach daale hai raajnneetik ke khel ke nae niyam
 
 
 
 1
 Shivraj Singh has put a hat-trick on 'dileri' in Salam Madhya Pradesh
 vaise tamaam pre-pole survey bhi unhen ajey bataa rahe the
 But despite this, he contested from two assembly seats
 apni hi seat par naa haar jaaen, isliye ehtiyaat ke taur par unhone budhani ke saath vidisha se chunaav maidan main utaarne kaa faisla kiya
 On the other hand, if we talk about Kejriwal, not only did his party enter the electoral arena for the first time, but they also contested for the first time
 dilli main congress ko lagaataar teen baar satta dilaane vaali party kii diggaj netaa shila dikshit ke khilaaf unhone chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya
 Arvind had the option of contesting from a safe seat, but he was not afraid of Sheila Dixit's political history
 kya hoga agar party kaa netaa hi apni seat haar jaae? aisa 'agar-magar' kaa sawaal kejariwal ke jehan main nahin aayaa or janata ne unki is dilari or saahas kaa sammaan kiya
 2
 'aadarshon' ko salaamcongress or bijepi saarvajanik jivan main eemaandaaree kii baat karti hai
 But when elections come, she prefers 'winning ability' rather than honesty in terms of selection of both candidates
 lekin kejariwal ne unhen galat sabit kar diya
 While making the party, he promised the public that he would not give tickets to any tainted person
 anya partiyon dwaara aarope lagaae jane ke baad unhone chunaav se mahaj 4 din pehle party kaa ek ummidavaar hataa diya
 Obviously, the Aam Aadmi Party cares about its principles and ideals
 3
 Salutations to 'honesty' knew that Kejriwal's party had only one thing - honesty
 yahi uski daulat he or yahi uskaa virdohi partiyon ko maat dene kaa hathiyaar, isliye anya partiyon ne kai martabaa unki or unki party kii chhavi par daag lagane kii koshish kii
 Many times, Kejriwal and other party leaders were targeted against him and an inquiry was conducted against him
 yahaan tak ki anna hajaare ne bhi party kii satyanishtha par sawaal uthaae
 But Kejriwal stood firm and gave proof of his honesty and transparency
 thode voton se haarane vaali shajia ilmi par jab ek sting oparation ke jariye galat dhang se paise vasuulne ke aarope lage to unhone ummidavaari chhodane kaa faisla kar liya tha
 She returned to the electoral arena only after it was found that the sting operation tapes had been tampered with to trap her
 janata ne yah sab dekha or 'aap' ko samarthan diya, kyonki uske liye eemaandaaree kaaphi myne rakhti he
 4
 'yuva' ko salahdhikansh raajnneetik partiyaan yuvaaon ko satta main bhagidaari kii baat karti hai
 But the truth is that his jumlas are limited to lips only
 chunaavon main jab tikat dene kii baat aati he to party alaakaman diggaj or anbhavi netaa ko hi chunata he
 According to him, politics is a game of diplomacy, which only experienced leaders can understand
 agar vah yuva ko tikat dete bhi hai to satta or party kii kaman unheen umradraj netaaon ke paas rahati he
 But contrary to this situation, Kejriwal paid attention to young voters and young candidates
 nateeja sabake saamne he
 The youngest member of the Delhi Legislative Assembly belongs to his party, whose age is 25 years
 janata ne kejariwal ke is 'yuva' adarsh par muhar lagaai
 5
 'janata ke muddon' ko salamavaise to congress or bijepi donon janata se jude muddon kii baat karte dikhte hai
 But during the election campaign, the Congress brushed aside the issue of corruption
 bijepi ne is mudde ko apni suvidha or fayed ke mutabik bhunaaya
 This issue forced the BJP to field its CM candidate Harsh Vardhan, while Kejriwal made the problem a major election issue
 unhone mahangi bijli-pani or aam janata se judi samasyaon ko mudda banaaya
 It is clear that these assembly elections were not Modi versus Rahul Gandhi, but a battle of public versus system
 county cricket ke mukhya kaaryakari ne kaha ki bharat or england ke bich test siries ke liye tikaton kii bikri kam hone kaa kaaran galat kaarykram he

 lekin vaastaviktaa yah he ki mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ke maamalon main koi kami dekhne ko nahin mili he
 Talking about ncrb's recent survey report, Delhi has become the most vulnerable state for women

 serial 'sasuraal simer kaa' se apni pahchaan banane vaale actor dhiraj dhupar ne apni garlfriend vinni aroda se buudhvaar ko shaadi kar lee
 Dheeraj was married to Punjabi customs in a grand way
 dhiraj or vinni kii mulaakaat 7 saal pehle serial'swarg' ke set par hui thi
 The two fell in love with each other while working together in the serial
 7 saal chalaa ye ishk buudhvaar ko rajdhani dilli main apane anjaam tak panhucha
 Munde Dheeraj of Delhi looked very excited before the wedding
 unhone bataaya, 'maine or vinni ne saat saalon se shaadi ke sapane ko lakhon baar jiya he, aakhirkaar wo pal aa hi gaya, main bahoot khush hum, har lamhe ko main khub enjoy kar rahaa hum'
 His bride does not have to wait too much, so Dheeraj got ready in just half an hour, not only that, he got himself ready and also did his own makeup
 navy blue achkan or laal pagadi main dhiraj kaaphi handsam lag rahe the
 At the same time, Vinny also looked very beautiful like a new fledgling bride in a red lehenga
 vinni ne bataaya,'main bahut khush hum ki finali meri shaadi mere prince charmig se ho rahi he, dilachasp baat ye he ki aaj hi hamen mili 7 saal ho jaayenge, main vaada karti hum kii main har mode par dhiraj kaa saath nibhaaoongi'
 In Dheeraj and Vinny's wedding, many TV stars also came to Mumbai to congratulate them, especially from Mumbai
 loksabhaa ke baad rajyasabha main naagarikta sanshodhan bill pasrajyasabha main voting ke dauraan shivasena ne kiya bahishkarloksabhaa ke baad buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main bhi naagarikta sanshodhan bill paas ho gaya
 After long discussion in the Rajya Sabha, the bill was passed by voting
 voting ke dauraan bill ke paksh main 125 or uske virodh main sirf 99 mat pade
 After which this historic bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha
 ab naagarikta vidheyak ko sansad ke donon sadanon se manjuuri mil gai he
 After this, it will become law after the President's signature on the Bill
 shivasena ne chunaa bich kaa rastabuudhvaar ko maharashtra main haal hi main congress or ensipi ke samarthan se sarkaar banane vaali shivasena ne bich kaa rasta chunaa
 Shiv Sena decided to stay away from the voting process of Rajya Sabha and walkout from the House
 yahaan aapako yah bhi bataa den ki loksabhaa main shivasena ne citijanship amedament bill kaa samarthan kiya tha
 In such a situation, this step of Shiv Sena was shocking for everyone
 shivasena kii vaicharik majaboorishivsena ne bhale hi kuch din pehle do secular partiyon ke saath milakar maharashtra main sarkaar banaai ho lekin uski vichaardhaara hameshaa se hinduvadi rahi he
 This is the reason why it was difficult for Shiv Sena to oppose this bill in Rajya Sabha
 is vajah se shivasena ne badla faislacongress ke sutron ne ajtak ko bataaya ki party kaa sheersh netritv shivasena dwaara loksabhaa main bill ke paksh main vot karne se khafa tha
 a clear message related to this was conveyed to the recently formed alliance in Maharashtra
 isi vajah se shivasena ne 24 ghanton ke bheetar bill par apana stand badal liya
 Sanjay Raut gave the cleanliness Shiv Sena leader and MP Sanjay Raut has clarified on this move of the party
 sanjay raut ne kaha he ki maine or meri party ne tay kiya ki is bill par uth rahe sawaalon kaa jawaab sahi dhang se nahin diya gaya he
 Therefore, it would not be right to support or oppose the bill
 sanjay raut ne aage kaha ki ham yah nahin kehete hai ki sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta na di jaae, unhen naagarikta milani chahie
 But we say that if there has been a conspiracy for vote bank politics, as has been alleged, then they should not be given the right to vote for the next 25 years
 centre sarkaar ne 8veen class tak ke bacchon ko fail naa karne kii niti ko khatm karne kii manjuuri de di he
 In such a situation, these tips are for those students who till now were negligent about studies
 agar aap chaahate hai ki kaksha main fail naa hon to karen karen aise taiyaari
 Keep in mind from the beginning, for the better future of students, the government is making many changes in the education system
 aise main aap padhai ko lekar apni qamar kas len
 So that change does not affect your studies
 har vishay kii jaankariapako kaksha main padhaaye jane vaale har vishay kii jaankaree honi chahie
 So that even after changes in any subject, your studies and marks are not affected
 jab bos kaa chillaanaa ban jaae daily routine, to yun rakhen khud ko coolpadhai ko naa len halke mensarkaar kaa ye faisla lene kaa makasad yahi he ki students padhai ko halke main naa len
 Even before, according to the policy of the government, you used to pass till the 8th
 ekadam se 9veen kaksha kii padhai kaa bhaar students jhel nahin pate
 Fill this life in a lifeless office desk 
 
 khud ko karen majaboongar aap chaahate hai ki aap har field main apana naam kamaayen to shuruyaat se hi padhai par dhyaan rakhen
 According to the government, students will continue to make new changes in the days to improve their studies
 lekin aap khud ko aise taiyaar karen ki vah padhai bhi kar len saath hi kisi tarah kaa pressure bhi mahasoos naa karen
 The Congress has again reposed faith in 80-year-old Sheila Dixit
 party ne unhen dilli pradesh congress samiti kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya he
 This is the second time Sheila Dixit has been given the command of Delhi at the time of crisis
 aam aadmi party se shila dikshit bhale hi chunaav main haar gai hon, lekin unke jane ke baad party phir se khadi nahin ho pai
 The development work done in Delhi gave him a different identity, the party tried to stand second-line leaders, but the high command felt that if there was to be a fight back in Delhi, there could be no better alternative than Sheela
 
 unase jis tarah kii apeksha kii ja rahi he, use dekhte hue unke saamne chunautiyaan bhi kam nahin hongi
 The biggest challenge is to bring the faltering Congress back to Delhi
 aam aadmi party ne congress ke us tabake par kabja jamaa liya he jo kabhi congress kaa vot bank hua karata tha
 This challenge is even greater because it is generally believed that the Congress vote is lower middle class and middle class
 lekin arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne apni pani-bijli, mohalla clinics, schuli shiksha ke dhaanche main sudhaarney jaisi pahalon ke jariye congress ke is vot bank ko saadhane kii koshish kii he
 How to get killed in lifeless organization? Congress has given responsibility to Sheila Dixit at a time when she does not have any MLA in Delhi
 kaaryakarta lagbhag bikhar chuke hai
 Right now the leaders of the second line of the Delhi Congress are nowhere to be seen
 centre or dilli main sarkaar na hone kii vajah se party kaaryakartaaon main utsaah ghat gaya he
 The party needs to be streamlined at the organizational level
 rajya main party apane kadam sanbhaalane main juty hui he
 Perhaps Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given the responsibility to Sheila Dikshit to prepare the political land of Delhi for the party again
 vidhansabha chunaav 2013 main mili shikast ke baad se congress apana vot aadhaar majboot karne main juty hui he, or shila dikshit ke samaksh yahi chunauti hogi
 How possible is the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party, the kind of political picture that remains at the national level, in which all the regional parties standing in opposition including the Congress are trying to contest in the alliance
 bihar or uttar pradesh main gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa bhi kii ja chuki he
 Among these enthusiasts, in Delhi, it was speculated that in the Lok Sabha elections, will the Congress ally with its rival, the new fledgling Aam Aadmi Party? It was heard in the political corridor that the Congress could consider it
 lekin sawaal he ki kya congress aam aadmi party se gathbandhan karegi? us aam aadmi party se, jo congress ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ko lekar chale andolan kii garbh se paidaa hui he
 Not only did the Aam Aadmi Party arise from the anti-corruption Anna movement, but in the Assembly elections it brought the Congress to the floor with haste and no single candidate of the party could be elected as MLA
 aam aadmi party se mili siyaasi chot ko dilli kii kaman sambhaal chuke ajay maakan sambhawatah bakhubi mahasoos kar rahe honge
 Therefore, he was against the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party
 punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh bhi apane rajya main arvind kejariwal se dosti ko hari jhandi dikhaane se manaa kar chuke hai
 Sheila Dixit is also eyeing against it
 ‘ajtak’ se ek baatcheet main vah kahati hai, ‘congress apane aap main sakasham he
 We have no need to tie up with anyone
 aam aadmi party kaa jo record rahaa he, wo hamen prerit nahin karata he
 We never supported the Aam Aadmi Party
 usne hamaare khilaaf chunaav ladaa
 'but it also goes to say that nothing is possible in politics because there is no permanent enemy or any such thing as permanent
 agar ye surat bane ki dilli main loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye congress ko aam aadmi party se gathbandhan karnaa pad jaae to phir sawaal hoga he ki vidhansabha chunaav main kya? kya donon dal ek saath chunavi maidan main utrenge? yaa phir donon kii raahen juda hongi?umr ke is padaav par kitni kargar hongi dikshithshila dikshit ne 1998 main isse pehle dilli congress kii kaman sanbhali thi
 At that time the political situation had become such that the party was continuously facing defeat in various elections
 iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 1991, 1996 or 1998 ke loksabhaa, 1993 ke vidhaan sabha or 1997 nagar nigam chunaavon main bhi congress ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Given the old profile of Sheila Dixit, the Congress high command has decided to hand over the leadership of Delhi to her
 vah 15 varshon tak lagaataar mukhyamantri raheen
 During this time, he is given the credit for changing the entire infrastructure of Delhi
 apane prashasnic anubhav kii badaulat unhone alaakaman ko apane par dobaaraa bharosa dilaayaa he
 Because there is no dispute about their functioning
 unhen ek behatar manager mana jaataa he
 Looks full of confidence about his old experiences
 ‘ajtak’ ke is sawaal par vah kahati bhi hai ki, ‘alaakaman ko lagata he ki mujhe dilli kaa anubhav he or yahi kaaran he ki unhone nai dilli congress pramukh ke liye mujhe chunaa
 'in order to oust the BJP from power, the order of opposition parties in different states has started
 congress mahagathbandhan kii purajor tarafdaari kar rahi he
 She has formed a grand alliance in Bihar
 haalanki shila dikshit apni siyaasi ranneeti kaa khulaasa nahin kar rahi hai
 The Congress does not have a single seat in the Lok Sabha and Assembly in Delhi
 is sthiti main agle chunaav kii ranneeti par vah kahati hai ki, ‘dilli main gathbandhan par charchaa chal rahi he or jab vakt aayega to pataa chal jayega
 ' jammu-kashmir main congress party chaahati he ki umr abdulla ko mukhyamantri ke pad se hataa diya jaae
 Congress leaders in the Valley are more than angry with the National Conference (NC) for ignoring them, while in January 2009, they strongly supported Sonia Gandhi's decision to hand over the leadership of the coalition to Omar Abdullah
 magar ab ve chaahate hai ki mukhyamantri kaa pad unki hi party ke kisi netaa ko 5 janvari, 2012 tak de diya jaae, us samay tak umr abdulla shashan ke teen saal puure ho jaaenge
 There are several reasons for this growing discontent in Srinagar
 masalan, mukhyamantri udaseenta kii had tak khamosh rahete hai; rajnatik diggajon kii sujh-boojh kii jagah apane salaahkaaron or naukarshahon kii salaah par nirbhar rahanaa; mushkil halaat se nipatane main unki aakshamata, jisaki vajah se lagaataar do garmiyon main hinsa faili; or vivaad ko nyotaa dene-afzal guru kii faansee ke maamle par twit yaa balaatkaar se peedit mahilaon kii anjaane main shinaakht-kii unki achook kshamta
 So has the third-generation Abdullah, whom people had high hopes for, has become meaningless in his political career so soon? Abdul Ghani Khan, District President of Srinagar Congress, says, "the post of Chief Minister should be with the Congress
 yah congress or neshnal conference ke bich 50-50 kii saajhedaari thi
 "people's Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti says," Umar never has control over anything
 '' unka ishaara 30 sitambar ko neshnal conference ke kaaryakarta haji saiyad mohammad yusuf kii police hiraasat main hui maut se uthe bavaal kii ore tha
 a day before this, he was called to the Chief Minister's official residence on Gupkar Road on charges of corruption
 vivaadon or ghotaalon kii lambii fehrist main yusuf kaa maamla sabase taaja he, jisane 41 varshiya mukhyamantri ko pareshaani main daal diya he
 The biggest question that arises in Srinagar at the moment is how Yusuf, a former Hizbul Mujahideen supporter, has become so close to the Chief Minister? To prove this 'nearness', Mehbooba shows some pictures on his mobile, including Yusuf is currently standing next to Omar Abdullah on the stage during the visit of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi
 anya raajnneetikon kaa daawa he ki yusuf mukhyamantri ke pita faruk abdulla kaa bhi kareebi tha
 Mehbooba said, "we have already been saying that Omar Abdullah's National Conference government is very corrupt
 oonche padon ke liye paison kaa khel chal rahaa he
 "she puts forward Omar Abdullah's confession as evidence that Yusuf sanctioned a large sum of money in exchange for seats for NC workers in the Legislative Council
" dekhne kii baat yah he ki sattadhari gathbandhan main kisi ne, yahaan tak ki mukhyamantri ne bhi bhrashtachar ke in aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 However, the scope of the judicial investigation into Yusuf's death will be limited to the events in Omar's residence and subsequent police custody
 khan kehete hai, ''kisi jaanch? ve jaanate hai ki phayda uthaane vaale log koun the
 National Conference leaders are taking money and now people are getting killed
 '' khan ghati main apni party ke janaadhar se kaaphi aahat hai
 However they do not believe that Omar is corrupt
 lekin khan kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri ne apane aasapaas bhrasht logon kii jamaat khadi kar rakhi he
 They are angry about the leadership of their own party in Delhi
 ve kehete hai, ''rahul gandhi yahaan kisi rajkumaar kii tarah saiyr-sapate ke liye aae
 He is deeply saddened that Rahul did not visit the party's office in Srinagar
 congress ke netaa khulkar yaa nijee taur par ab kashmir main sarkaar main badi hissedari chaahate hai
 Even before the Yusuf case, many young activists had privately informed Rahul about the corruption and nepotism that continued in the ragyas
 unke mutabik congress ke netaa or kaaryakartaaon kii jaan-bujhkar andekhi kii ja rahi he, jiske kaaran varisht upaadhyaksh mujffar hossain parry ko party se istipha dena padaa
 However, the state president Saifuddin Soz later persuaded him and returned to the party
 khan kaa aarope he ki congress ke panchon or sarpanchon ke saath bhi sautela bartaav kiya ja rahaa he
 He said, "NC does not respect him in his own villages, so why should he support the Chief Minister?" ham (congress ke log) apane daftaron main taala lagaakar logon se kah sakate hai ki ve apane gharon main baithen
 "NC people gathered around Omar say that Sonia Gandhi promised to be nc's chief minister for a full six years
" nekan ke ek varisht netaa ke mutabik, ''yahaan tak ki shuru main mantriyon ke vibhaag bhi isi aadhaar par tay kiye gaye the
 Concerned over the possibility of Delhi changing its intentions for the alliance due to political pressure in the Valley, NC leaders believe that Omar, who was relatively peaceful after two consecutive summers of turmoil, is doing better this year
 ve kehete hai ki unka tej-tarraar netaa logon ko apane saath jodne ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahaa he
 a senior party official said, "he has visited 39 constituencies, held 53 public meetings outside Srinagar and always holds Janata Darbar, where he meets around 800 people every Wednesday morning
" ''unhen ummid he ki dilli ko yah badlaav saaf dikh rahaa hoga, jo ghati main is saal aane vaale 10
 It is also evident from 73 lakh tourists
 in sailaaniyon main 30,000 videshi bhi shaamil hai
 Omar and his advisers have one more reason to remain at the peak of power for the next three years: an influential section of Congress leaders who have been given a place in the government
 sarkaar main jagah paane vaale isi tarah ke congress netaa janaswasthya mantri taj mohiuddeen kaa kahana he ki congress ke liye mukhyamantri pad kii khatir dabaav daalana ''avyaavhaarik or naammumkin'' hoga
 He is confident that "NC will never want to be a part of the Congress-led alliance
" ''khan isse sahamat nahin hai
 He says, "these people live in luxurious bungalows and take big salaries from the Chief Minister
" ve umr kii mukhaalafat kaise kar sakate hai?''sthaneey adhikari bhi maanate hai ki nekan kabhi vipaksh main nahin baithna chaahegi kyonki teen saal satta se dur rahane ke baad party ko dobaaraa khadaa karnaa uske liye mushkil hoga
 a senior administrative officer says, "every Kashmiri knows that Delhi is the one who commands in Kashmir; Therefore NC will do what Delhi tells them to remain in power
 ''unka kahana he ki umr sthiti se nipatane ke liye har mumkin koshish karenge
 Maybe they will finally clear the way for their more popular leader and their father, Farooq Abdullah
 srinagar main ek bujurg shaks ne mukhyamantri kii museebaton ke bare main apni hi tarah kaa gyaan dete hue kaha, ''unhen muharram ke dauraan pad kii shapath nahin leni chahie thi
 There should be no work of happiness during mourning
 ''matlab yah ki baap-bete kii jodi ke saamne is vipareet haalat se nibatane or apni yogyata sabit karne kii chunauti he
 Omar Abdullah's National Conference government is completely corrupt
 jammu-kashmir main oonche padon ke liye moti rakam kaa len-dein kiya ja rahaa he

 HD Kumaraswamy is the 18th Chief Minister of the state currently holding the largest political post in Karnataka
 vah rajya main jedies ke pradesh adhyaksh rah chuke hai or party pramukh echdi devgauda ke bete hai
 Earlier, Kumaraswamy had been the Chief Minister of Karnataka in 2006
 do baar karnataka ke mukhyamantri banane ke baavjood kumaraswami ko dilli main apane pita ke baraabar ahmiyat hasil nahin ho saki
 He reached the Lok Sabha twice, but in the politics of the center, he never played more than an MP
 kumaraswami kaa janm 16 disambar 1959 ko karnataka ke hasan jile ke hardanhalli main hua tha
 He inherited politics because his father HD Deve Gowda has already entered politics, who later went on to become the Prime Minister of the country
 kumaraswami kii shuruaati padhai hasan ke hi sarkari skool main hui or uske baad vah ucch shiksha ke liye bengalooru chale gaye
 From here he b

 In 1986, Kumaraswamy married Anita, both of whom have a son named Nikhil Gowda
 nikhil telugu or kannada filmon ke abhinayta hai
 In 2010, Kannada film actress Radhika claimed that Kumaraswamy had married her in 2006, along with the couple having a daughter
 raajnneetik safarkumaraswami ke raajnneetik safar se shuruyaat 1996 se hua jab unhone kanakapura loksabhaa seat se chunaav jeeta
 But in the by-elections held two years later, he also faced a crushing defeat from this seat
 iske baad kumaraswami ne 1999 main sathanur se vidhansabha chunaav ladaa, lekin unhen phir se haar mili
 In 2004, he won from Ramnagar and reached the assembly
 is chunaav main kisi bhi dal ko sarkaar banane ke liye bahumat hasil nahin hua or soobe main congress or jedies ke gathbandhan vaali sarkaar bani
 After this, Kumaraswamy won the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 aise bane rajya ke mukhyamantrikumaraswami ne 2004 main congress or jedies ke gathbandhan kii sarkaar se apni party ko 2006 main baahar kar liya
 The result was that the Dharam Singh-led government of the Congress fell
 iske baad rajyapal ne kumaraswami ko sarkaar gathan ke liye bulaayaa or is tarah 4 farvari 2006 ko kumaraswami pehali baar bijepi ke sahyog se karnataka ke mukhyamantri chune gaye
 However, his tenure remained for 7 months and he resigned from the post in October 2007 due to the coalition government
 duusari baar bane siempichhali saal karnataka main hue vidhansabha main kumaraswami kii jedies rajya main tisare number kii party thi
 But then the BJP, the largest party in the state, did not have enough figures to form the government alone
 iske baad vipakshi dal congress ne jedies ke saath gathbandhan kar sarkaar banaai or kumaraswami ko ek baar phir se karnataka kaa mukhyamantri banane kaa mauka mila
 However, for the last few days, strong rhetoric between Congress and JDS leaders has intensified
 vivaadon se rahaa he gaharaa naathavivaadon se kumaraswami kaa gaharaa naata rahaa he, phir chaahe vah nijee jivan ke vivaad hon, yaa phir mukhyamantri rahete pad ke durupyog kaa maamla ho
 There was also a dispute over Kumaraswamy's second marriage, in which a PIL was filed against him for violating the Hindu Marriage Act
 media report ke mutabik unhone kannada abhinetri radhika se shaadi kii thi, haalanki karnataka hai court ne sabooton ke abhaav main is yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 Apart from this, Kumaraswamy and his wife Anita have also been facing serious allegations about coal mines

 After some time, the doctor proposed marriage to the female player
 mahila ne use sweekaar kar liya kyonki use laga ki doctor achche parivesh se taalluk rakhata he
 The complaint states that by March this year, the doctor had called the female player once in Goa and once in Bangalore and sexually abused her
 mahila ne jab use shaadi kii yaad dilaai to usne aisa karne se inkaar kar diya
 There was a lot of debate between the two
 doctor ke is vyavhaar se aahat mahila khilaadi ne police main shikaayat karne kii dhamkee di
 The doctor forbade him to do so and said that if he did it, he would have to suffer the consequences on social media
 doctor ne mahila khilaadi ko jaan se maarane kii bhi dhamkee di
 The comments tibile ne kaha ki is maamle ko gambheertha se lete hue kolhapur police ne doctor ko pakadaney ke liye do timen gathit kii hai
 The Maharashtra Police has also sought help from the Karnataka Police in its efforts to nab the doctor and bring justice to the female sportsman

 ) This question is very old, can men and women be friends? Every time, every time this question comes to us somewhere
 research kii kasuti par rishton kaa sach |'kamasutra' main kya?shaayad aapane yahi sawaal 'harry met seli' film main bhi suna hoga
 After this, many films have been made on this subject
 in filmon main 'maai best friend wedding' or 'ham tum' jaisi filmein to kaaphi pasand bhi kii gai hai
 If we talk about today's era, then you must have understood the female-male friendship very well in Genelia and Imran Khan's film Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na
 banie vafaadaar, na ki 'bevafa sanam'
 
 
 Love-kissed In today's time too, this question has caused a lot of upheaval in relationships
 logon kii bhitari duniya main jhaank kar dekhen, to aapako pataa chalegaa ki is dosti kii vajah se pati-patni ke rishte kaaphi uljhe hue hai
 The only difference between films and personal life is that the characters in real life roles are not tied to the story of a film
 taaki sadaa majboot rahe 'pyaar kaa bandhan' |pyaar-bharaa chumbaiksar log pyaar or dosti main antar nahin kar pate
 Due to the best friend of opposite sex, nowadays marriages of people are on the verge of breaking up
 relationships counslar camel khurana kaa kahana he ki ek mahila or ek purush jab ek duusare se bhaavnaatmak rup se judate hai, to donon main se koi ek-duusare ke prati archishit hota he
 This is where relationships begin to get entangled, especially when a friend is married
 jaise-jaise samaaj main khulaapan bad rahaa he, vaise-vaise kya ham bhaavnaatmak rup se bhi ek-duusare ke rishte ko samajhane main sakasham ho rahe hai? lifestil export rachana singh kaa kahana he ki aksar best friend kii paribhaasha aapke jeevanasathi ko kahin peeche chhod detii he or yaheen se samasyaayein paidaa hone lagati hai
 According to the composition, while there is love, trust and companionship in friendship, in a married life there is love, trust and sex in addition
 yah ek shabd main hi sabase bada antar chipa hota he
 Triangle love relationships often lead to envy, cheating and fighting
 kisi bhi mahila ko virginity test (virginity Test) ke liye baadhya karnaa ab aapako jail kii salaakhon ke liye pahunchaa saktaa he
 The Maharashtra government has taken a major decision to abolish the 'virginity test', one of the culprits of the society
 darasal, maharashtra sarkaar (maharashtra govt) ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki vah kisi mahila ko comarya pareekshan ke liye baadhya karne ko sheeghra hi dandaneey aparaadh banaaegi
 Actually, some communities in the state have this tradition
 in samudaayon main navvivaahit mahila ko yah sabit karnaa hota he ki shaadi se pehle vah virgin yani kunari thi
 Minister of State for Home Ranjit Patil met a delegation of some social organizations on the issue on Wednesday
 shivasena pravaktaa neelam gorahe bhi is pratinidhimandal kaa hissaa thim
 Minister Ranjit Patil told reporters after the meeting, 'virginity test will be considered as a form of sexual assault
 
 
 
 a circular will be issued in consultation with the Department of Law and Justice, wherein it will be declared a punishable offense
 ' unhone aage kaha ki pratishtha ko chot pahunchane vaala yah rivaaj kanjarbhat bhaat or kuch anya samudaayon main he
 Some youths of the same community have started online campaigns against it
 is bich, patil ne yah bhi kaha ki unka vibhaag yon hamale ke maamalon kii har do maheene par samiksha karegi or yah sunishchit karegaa ki adaalaton main aise maamle kam lambit rahen
 Now you can have the police complex written at the ATM
 bengalooru police aisi hi vyavastha karne ja rahi he
 Under this, a kiosk like ATM will be built in your neighborhood, which will also have a video camera
 aapako vahaan jaakar camere ke saamne apni shikaayat bolkar darj karaani hogi
 An English newspaper has reported this effect
 yah video ek khaas jagah par pahunch jayega
 From there he will be handed over to the concerned police station
 is audio-vijual ko police exiaar main badal degi
 After that, the complainant will be informed
 use us maamle kii jaanch ke bare main bhi bataa diya jayega
 This arrangement will first be in Bengaluru and then in other cities of Karnataka
 aisa hi ek prayog bhubaneshwar kii police ne kiya tha
 In the same year a kiosk named 'I Click' was built in the capital of Odisha
 vahaan har din paanch shikaayatein aati hai
 Seeing this, the Karnataka government has taken this decision
 uskaa maananaa he ki isse logon kii shikaayat darj hogi or unka police par vishwaas badhegaa
 This will enable action against those who commit crimes against women
 iske tahat shikaayat karne waalon ke naam or pate gupt rakhe jaaenge
