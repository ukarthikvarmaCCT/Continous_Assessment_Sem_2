 aaj se kareeb chah sau varsh pehle sant kabirdaas ke samakaleen the, sant ravidaas / raidas
 Sant Ravidas, who hurts caste and varna system through his writings, has a prevalent couplet: caste is caste, caste is the caste of Ketan
 raidas manush na jud sake, jab tak jati na jaat
 Now look at the irony of this society
 upi kii raajnneeti ne jaise hi chunavi varsh main pravesh kiya, kaashi ke ek dalit parivaar main paidaa hue inhen sant ravidaas kii jati praasangik ho gai
 This time the sight of the Sant Ravidas Temple at Sir Govardhanpur behind the Kashi Hindu University on 639th birth anniversary on 22 February was unprecedented
 subah das bajkar das minute par pradhanmantri narendra modi pahunche
 Mtha Teka, ate anchor and tried to cement his Dalit agenda
just two and a half hours after modi ke sant ravidaas mandir se jane ke thik dhai ghante baad aam aadmi party ke netaa or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal pahunche
 Wreathed the saint's statue and drank tea as prasadam

 20 among the total population of the state among political parties

 Challenging the Elephant As soon as the case of suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Dalit student of Hyderabad University after the JNU case, weakened, Mayawati took a stand in Parliament

 Mayawati hinted that she would not let the issue of the suicide of a Dalit student go hand-in-hand with the Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani

 Junk of reservation in promotion When the Supreme Court quashed the system of reservation in promotion implemented during the BSP regime, the SP government did not delay in "reversing" the Dalit officers who benefited from it

 The day of February 19 in Bibipur village, ten kilometers on the highway between Jind to Bhiwani, was special in itself as some men were also present among the huge gathering of women on that day
 inhen sambodhit karne vaali yuva mahila kaa naam anita kundu he jo hisar sthit uklana ke bhoomihin madhyavargeey parivaar se aati hai
 He won Mt
 Everest in May 2012, in lieu of which he got the job of sub-inspector in Haryana Police
 kundu ke saath 44 gaanvon kii pratinidhi or behad shaktishaalee khap satarol ke mukhiya captain mahavir lohan bhi maujuud the
 He himself is a strong opponent of female feticide and murder in the name of saving the honor of the family
 us din bibipur main apane kism kii is adbhut mahila chaoupal main (nau gaanvon kii) naugama khap ke yuva or buudhe sadsy bhi maujuud the
 As more women were coming, they were leaving their chairs for them
 khap panchayaton ke liye kukhyat haryana ke bichobich sthit bibipur main jo ghat rahaa he, vah ek bade saamaajik badlaav kaa sambhavit sanket he jo aane vaale samay main vivekpurna khap panchayaton kii shakl le saktaa he
 It began on July 14, 2012, when 32-year-old Sunil Jaglan, a young sarpanch of Bibipur and father of two daughters, convened a mahapanchayat of 112 khaps in Haryana, Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and demanded the death penalty against female feticide
 They were motivated to adopt a joint resolution
 bujurgon ko hui ''asahajata'' ko yaad karte hue sarpanch kii 29 varshiya bahan ritu bataati hai, ''yah kaam aasaan nahin tha
 He was not used to saying that women should speak in their midst
 jab main bolne uthi to charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya
 "soon this unease began to wane
 jagalan us din ko yaad karte hue bataate hai, ''pehali baar auraton ne bina kisi bandhan ke bhagidaari kii or bina dare khap ke aalaa netaaon par sawaal uthaae
 "one by one the ardent princes laid down their arms in front of them
" kanoon main to bahut pehle ling pareekshan par roak lag chuki thi, lekin itane saal baad aakhirkaar khap ke sabhi bujurg is baat par sahamat ho sake ki kanya bhrunahatya ko hatya ke baraabar hi mana jaae
 Jaglan says that the persuasion of the Khap leaders for a resolution against the age-old desire to have a boy within the Jat community in North India was actually a result of the awareness and growing concern that the sex ratio among adults has reached alarming levels and many With the decreasing rate of sex ratio at birth from the villages, it is feared that it will reach worse condition
 masalan, haryana main 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik ausat rajyavar linganupaat 1,000 purushon par 879 mahilaon kaa he
 But the news coming from the villages is more frightening than this

 "of the total 7,363 villages in the state, 3,974, ie more than half of the villages, had a sex ratio below 500 at birth (0 to one year) in 2013

 Apart from this, there are about 2,400 villages and some small residences from where the news of the birth of any girl was not reported in 2013
 haryana ke atirikt mukhya sachiv or swasthya vibhaag ke prabharee ramanivas bataate hai ki lagaataar ghatata linganupaat kadi sachaai ko bayaan karata he or isaki upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 He says, "it is true that more and more girls are being killed in the womb

 According to him, the historical amendment of 2005 in the Hindu Succession Act to give equal share of ancestral property to girls, like boys, has only served to increase the desire of boys
 jind ke rahane vaale do kisaan anil kumaar or sunil lamba bees kii umr kaaphi pehle paar kar chuke hai lekin unhen lagata he ki unki gruhasthi basane main abhi kaaphi samay lagegaa

 His attempt to get the Khapas to pass a resolution against female feticide in July 2012 may not have gone as far as making concessions in intergovernmental and inter-caste marriages, but the start he has made is more important

 The fact was that the police did not know anything other than the identity of the deceased
 halaat uljhaanewaale the
 The police neither had any clue of the killers nor the eyewitnesses
 chunki joshi kaa iklauta vaaris bhi videsh main tha, maamle ko jaaydaad se jod kar dekhnaa bhi thik nahin tha
 In such a situation, the police decide to follow the investigation on the way
 yani wo makatool ke rishtedaar, naukar, aas-paas rahanevaale tamaam log sabase poochtacha kar joshi ke bare main zyaada se zyaada jaankaree hasil karne kii koshish main lagati he
 In this connection, the police finds that since Joshi's son, who is a teacher in a government school, is settled abroad and his wife has been arranged, he has lived alone here for a long time
 unako jaananevaale log bataate hai ki joshi kisi jamaane main bahut khushmizaaj or milansaar kism ke insaan hua karte the, lekin apni bivi kii maut ke baad unhone ek tarah se jaise khud ko ghar main hi kaid kar liya tha
 Yes, he used to visit the Osho Ashram in Murthal, adjoining Delhi, to remove the emptiness of his life
 vaise to joshi ko rupye-paison kii koi kami nahin thi, lekin ye shaayad unka akelaapan hi tha, jisase bachane ke liye unhone skool main padhanevaale do ladakon ko apane ghar main peing guest ke taur par rakh liya tha
 It was Joshi's generosity that he started teaching the boys and did not get distracted from studies, so he had his cable connection disconnected
 lekin joshi kii shakhsiyat kii inhen baton ke saath-saath ek sawaal ye bhi uth khadaa hua ki agar joshi vaaki apane yahaan peing guest rahanevaale ladakon kaa itnaa hi khyaal rakhte the, to phir achaanak unhone joshi kaa makaan kyon chhod diya? kya unki padhai puri ho gai or yaa phir vajah ko or thi
 The investigation progressed and now the police came to know that he started seeing a light in the dark darkness of this blind murder
 tahaqikat ke shuruuaati padaav main halaat puraani ranjish kii theory ko nakaar rahe the lekin poochtacha main hi kuch aisa pataa laga ki police kaa shaq peing guest ladakon par gaharaata hi ja rahaa tha
 Now the attention of the police went towards the boys who had been the paying guest in Joshi's house and the police started searching for both of them as it usually happens
 donon to nahin mili, lekin police ne dilli se sate gudgaanv se 17 saal ke satbir ko uthaa liya
 Satveer had lived as a paying guest in Joshi's house with a friend
 zaahir he ki police ke shaq kii sui satbir or uske dost par hi jaakar tik rahi thi
 This was also an important reason for this, in the month of March this year, while vacating Joshi's house, both of them did not give them any time, but had left their house suddenly, saying that they would go to Bangalore one day
 or to or donon ko bangalore jane kii jaldi kuch itani zyaada thi ki unhone apana kuch saamaan to joshi ke ghar hi chhod diya, jo itane maheenon tak yun hi padaa rahaa
 But to solve this doubt, Satbir was required to be questioned
 lihaaza, interogeshan shuru hua or jald hi puri kahani saafe ho gai
 Satbir confessed that he, along with his friend Vikrant, had killed Joshi on the night of 17 December
 lekin sawaal ye tha ki jis joshi ne unhen dilli main rahane ke liye chat di or jisane unki padhai ke liye apni kai chaahaton par kanchi chalaa di, satvir or uske dost ne akhir usee joshi kaa qatl kyon kar diya? or wo bhi itane vahashiana tareeke se!sawaal ye bhi tha ki agar vaaki unhone joshi ke saath kisi baat kii pareshaani thi, to phir unhone joshi kaa qatl karne ke baad unka laptop or duusari keemtee chizein kyon chura lee? agar maamla ranjish kaa hi tha to phir ranjish nikaalane ke liye satvir ne puure nau maheene kaa intazaar kyon kiya? yakeenan in tamaam sawaalon kaa jawaab jane bina police kii tafteesh puri nahin ho sakati thi
 When the police were convinced of Satbir's words, he immediately completed the paperwork to nab him
 lekin uski umr ab bhi 18 saal se kam thi, lihaaza vardeevaale uske saath us tareeke se pesh nahin aa sakate the, aamtaur par jis tarah wo duusare qaatilon ke saath pesh aate hai
 The interrogation of Satbir began and as he opened his mouth, the intrigue of a creepy murder was exposed
 darasal, peing guest ke taur par rahete hue satbir or uske dost vikrant ne ek baar khud joshi ke makaan main hi chori kar lee thi
 Moreover, both had stolen millions of rupees from Joshi's credit card
 lekin ye baat joshi se chuphi nahin rah saki
 Joshi was bound to get angry
 ab joshi ne donon ke gharavaalon se shikaayat kii or donon ko police ke hawaale karne se bachaane kaa ek hi rasta bataaya, wo tha unke nuksaan kii bharpai karnaa
 What would the families of Satbir and Vikrant have done even now? On the one hand there was the life and respect of the children and on the other hand the wealth
 unhone bacchon kii zindagi chun lee or joshi ke nuksaan kii bharpai shuru kar di
 According to the deal that was decided with Satbir's family, he had to return the entire three and a half lakh rupees to Joshi
 gharavaalon ne der nahin kii or aadhe se zyaada rakam yani teen lakh rupye joshi ke haathon main rakh die
 But 50 thousand rupees were still left
 chori kii is vaardaat ke baad hi donon ladakon ke saath joshi ke rishte kharaab ho gaye or donon ne unka makaan bhi chhod diya
 But Joshi often kept pressure on the family of Satbir for the rest of his 50 thousand rupees
 satbir ko ye sab nagavar guzarane laga or ek rose unhone joshi ke qatl kaa kaufanaak faisalaa kar liya
 Satbir, who had been burning in revenge fire for months, now wanted Joshi's death
 lekin use dar tha ki kahin uskaa dost vikrant uskaa plan flop naa kar de
 So, on the afternoon of 17 December, when he left for Gurgaon with the intention of killing Joshi, he took another old friend with him instead of Vikrant
 raaj naa khule, isliye usne apane is dost se iraade bhi zaahir nahin kiye
 Now Satbir first arrived at his girlfriend's beauty parlor in Kalkaji and asked for a ladies' wig from there
 iraadaa tha pahchaan chhipaane kaa
 Then both proceeded on the same bike
 raat ho chuki thi or donon vasantkunj ke usee makaan ke saamne khadey the, jahaan kuch maheene pehle tak donon peing guest ke taur par rahaa karte the
 Keeping the friend standing outside, he went inside the kothi saying that he should meet Joshi
 ab usne apane sir par wig pahan rakhi thi, taaki kisi ko uske ladkaa hone kaa shaq naa ho
 He rang the call bell and got entangled in the house after talking
 ab wo shaks satbir ke saamne tha, jisase badale kii aag ne uske raaton kii neend or din kaa chaiyn chin liya tha
 He first spoke of his heart, and before Joshi could recover, he threw a hidden khukri on Joshi's head with full force
 achaanak hue is hamale se joshi behosh hokar farsh par ludhak gaye
 Satbir was afraid that Joshi would not be able to stand again, so he put a scissors close to Joshi's throat and held it until Joshi got cold by splashing
 ab vakt tha yahaan se nikalne kaa
 The police did not suspect him, so he robbed the case and came out of the back door picking up several valuables, including laptop and liquor bottle
 lekin itnaa sabakuch hone ke baavjood usne apane dost se koi baat nahin bataai
 The bus returned and left, pretending to take some of his belongings in front of the friend
 haa, uski wig zarur mauka-e-vaardaat par chhot gai thi

 The countdown to Lok Sabha election results has started
 24 ghante main yah saaf ho jayega ki sarkaar kiski banegi
 The counting of postal ballots will begin first
 iske baad iviem main darj voton kii ginati hogi
 Now the question arises why Postal Ballet (ETPBS) is the first to be counted
 ise lekar chunaav ayog kii niyamavali he
 In simple language, the number of postal ballots is small and these are ballot papers with paper and they are easy to count
 vahiin inamen kisi tarah ke milan kii gunjaaish bhi nahin hoti he
 What are Postal Ballot papers Postal ballot papers are just like ballot paper
 iske jariye matadaata apane mat kaa istemaal karata he
 But not everyone gets it
 postal ballat ke jariye vot dene kii suvidha, chunaav kii duty karne waalon or sena ke javaanon ko hi milti he
 Apart from this, no such facility is provided
 priventive ditension main rahane vaale log bhi iskaa istemaal karte hai
 The Election Commission already determines the number of people who vote with the Postal Ballot
 iske baad aise matadaataaon ko mail ke jariye ise bheja jaataa he
 For this, the postal ballot paper is scanned and this scan copy is attached and sent
 aise karmchaaree or sainya adhikari jinke liye kisi bhi tarah kii electronic suvidha nahin he, unke paas dak seva ke jariye mataptr bheja jaataa he
 If for some reason the voters do not use it or do not receive it then it returns to the sending address
 kin logon ko diya jaataa he postal ballatoyadi aap sena yaa sarkaar ke liye kaam karte hai yaa chunaav kii duty ke liye apane rajya se baahar tainaat hai yaa aapako 'priventive ditension' main rakhaa gaya he
 The Election Commission already determines the number of postal voters in the constituency
 jiske baad khaali dak mataptr ko electronic tareeke se voter tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 This is called the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS)
 agar voter aisi jagah he jahaan electronic tareeke kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa he to vahaan dak seva se mataptr bheja jaataa he
 If for some reason the voter is unable to use it then the ballot is returned
 kya hote hai ballat paper?80 ke dashak tak desh main jo bhi chunaav hote the wo ballat paper par hi hote the
 Ballot papers had candidates' election marks and names printed on them
 chunaav ke die prayek matadaata ko matdaan centre par ek ballat paper diya jaataa tha
 Then the voter used to seal or stamp the candidate's name and in front of the election symbol
 is ballat paper ko modakar vahiin par rakhe ballat box main daal diya tha
 Why was the ballot paper closed? When all the votes were cast, the election officials sealed the box and carried it to the strong room
 is prakriya main mehnat ke saath hi dekharekh main khub kharch lagata he
 At the same time, keeping the ballot box or ballot box was also very difficult
 itnaa hi nahin booth capring kii ghatnaayen bhi sunne ko milti thim
 Ballot paper was also used to intimidate voters, voting events and excessive use of ballot paper
 jiske baad chunaav ayog samay ke saath vyavastha main badlaav karata gaya
 Used the first EVM at a polling booth in the 1982 Kerala elections in India
 iske baad se ye ab tak hone vaale chunaav kaa hissaa hai
 Here will be the fastest results to see the fastest and accurate results of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections aajtak
 inpara rahen
 We will give you the latest update of all 542 seats
 saath hi chunaav nateezon par vishleshan bhi pesh karenge

 Yeddyurappa (@bsybjp)april 14, 2018unhone kaha, ''gundurav ke dwaara yogi adityanath ke khilaaf kiye gaye shabdon se main chakit hum
 This is completely an insult to the saint and a chief minister of the Nath sect
 karnataka main nath sampradaay ko maanane vaale lakhon log maaf nahin karenge
 i have full sympathy for you and the culture of your party
 ''darasal, shuukravaar ko kathua cond or unnav cond ke khilaaf candal march kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha, jisamenkarnatakacongress kii varking cameti ke adhyaksh dinesh gundurav bhi shaamil hue
 During this time, he attacked the CM of Uttar Pradesh Yogi with a befitting attack on the Unnao gang rape incident
 unhone upi ke siem ko kaha, ''vah yogi nahin hai, dhongi hai
 Prime Minister Modi should sack him
 '' itnaa hi nahin, gundurav ne yahaan tak kah diya ki agar yogi dobaaraa karnataka aaen, to unako chappal se petakar waapas bhej dena chahie
 During this time, Gundurao claimed that Yogi Adityanath had insulted Indian politics and he should have resigned from his post if he had any morality at all
 gundurav ke is bayaan ko lekar bijepi hamalavar ho gai he or congress se maafee kii maang kii he
 BJP General Secretary Ravi Kumar has demanded an apology from Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki bijepi congress party or uske pradesh adhyaksh ke khilaaf rajyavyapee virodh pradarshan kaa elaan kiya he
 Mr Rao, your love for Muslims must not translate to hatred for Hindu saints
 What were you thinking when you said Yogi Adityanath must be beaten with chappals?hindu-vokkaligas of K'taka hold him in high regard
 You have insulted the entire community with your heinous comments! - BJP Karnataka (@ bjp4karnataka) April 14, 2018 Gundurao insults Vokkaliga community
 Should not be turned into hatred towards us samay aap kya soch rahe the, jab kah rahe the ki yogi adityanath ko chappalon se peeta janaa chahie? karnataka ke hindu vokkaliga siem yogi ko kaaphi maanate hai
 Gundurao has insulted the entire community with his hateful statement
 '' karnataka bijepi ne twit kar kaha ki siddharmaiya sarkaar ke dauraan karnataka main rape ke 3,857 cese darj hue hai, to kya gundurav siddharmaiya ke khilaaf bhi yahi logic apanaayenge?vivaadit bayaan par gundurav ne di safigundurav ne kaha ki bijepi vidhayak rape kaa aaropee he
 The victim's complaint is not being filed
 ve virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The victim's father is arrested and beaten, leading to his death
 is par bhi siem yogi koi karrwai nahin karte hai
 After this the High Court intervenes and asks to register an FIR
 is par vidhayak ko giraftaar kiya jaataa he
 He questioned whether a true yogi does this? pradhanmantri karyaalay main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan ke vivaadaaspad lekhejokhe par aadhaarit sanjay baru kii kitaab ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii beti ne peeth main chura ghonpane ke samaan bataate hue un par pradhanmantri se vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Along with this, he has described the book as unethical, mischievous action
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan kaary karne vaali manmohan singh kii beti upinder singh ne kaha ki baru ne gappabajee or apusht kathanon ko ek saath jod diya he, jinamein se kuch unke pita ke bare main hai or unhen tathyon ke bayaan ke rup main istemaal kiya he
 Is this the morality? In an interview, he has also questioned the timing of the publication of the book of the former media advisor to the Prime Minister, which came to the market during the general election
 is kitaab ke chalate pradhanmantri karyaalay or sattarudh congress ko kaaphi sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Upinder Singh said that it cannot be called a meaningful book
 yah tathakthith kathanon kaa dhruapurna lekhajokha he jinhen tathyon ke rup main darj kiya gaya he
 The said things have been taken as direct talks
 kya yah naitikta he? kitaab main baru dwaara kiye gaye kuch daavon par sawaal uthaate hue unhone kaha ki vah kabhi bhi pradhanmantri karyaalay main niti nirdhaaran kii prakriya kaa hissaa nahin raheen
 After the election, the daughter of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that she is presenting herself at the center of events which is not correct and she did not have access to the files
 aisa nahin tha ki vah pradhanmantri ke pradhan sachiv the
 Upinder Singh said that she is not speaking on behalf of the Prime Minister, but we are very angry about how the author has exaggerated how much he had access to
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko kitaab ke bazaar main aane ke bare main soochna thi or jab unhone baru se poocha tha ki yah kitaab kab aegi to unhone kaha tha, swaabhaavik si baat he ki chunaav ke baad
 Not being well-wishers, while denying the author's claim that the publisher of Barukitab has chosen the time of its release, Upendra said that he too has written several books and knows that the author goes on about the timing of the book's release
 sanjay baru khud ko pradhanmantri kaa shubhachintak nahin kah sakate
 Popular Assam singer Zubeen Garg has been embroiled in controversy for allegedly disrespecting the national flag

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) October 27, 2017 Was the failure due to this? This time Aamir missed many places
 hakeekat main ye film 15 saal kii insiya or gharelu hinsa kii shikaar uski maa najma ke sangharsh kii kahani he
 But the campaign only featured Insia's story
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki marketing ke dauraan insiya kii maa kii kahani ko chhipaana film ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 Confusion was created among the people about the story
 diwali ko relies hona bhi film ke kaarobaar par asar daalane vaala sabit hua
 Do not show secret superstars to children? The mistakes that were not expected from Aamir, it is to be expected that during the week of Diwali, people have to watch a light-hearted entertaining film
 sikret superstar kaa is hafte relies hona galat nahin tha, golmaal agen jaisi masala se bharpoor film se ise nuksaan ho gaya
 Secret superstars also got less screens because of the breakup
 box offis par film ke kamjor hone kii ek badi vajah yah bhi he ki aamir kaa charitra utana lanbaa nahin he jitna hona chahie tha
 Zaira has done her part better than she expected, but Aamir's presence in the film is the most entertaining
 kahani ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina shakti kumaar ke kairactor kaa lanbaa hona kamai ke lihaaj se film ko phayda pahunchaa saktaa tha

 Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati of Jyotish and Sharada Peeth has demanded a CBI inquiry on granting of UA certificate despite objections being lodged by an advisory member of the censor board on some scenes and dialogues of the newly released film 'PK'

 shankaracharya ne kaha ki jis adhikari nesin or dialog par apattidarj karai thi uskaa film ko jari kiye gaye pramaan patr main naam hi nahin he
 Therefore, the issue of this certificate should be investigated by the CBI
 unhone kaha ki film 'pike' main kai drishy aapattijanak hai or sanathan dharm se jude logon ko aahat karne vaale hai
 In Sanatan Dharma, the idol is worshiped after consecration

 ' Whatever you say, no finger can be raised on Amar Singh's understanding of political opportunity
 satta ke haashie par khadey samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke purv mahasachiv amar singh kii tej nazren upie kii dhalati hui shaam or mulaayam singh ke chadhate suraj par baraabar tiki hui hai or man hi man unki gananaa bhi puri ho chuki he ki agar waapas lautnaa he to isse behatar samay phir nahin aane vaala
 And what better place than Varanasi for a new beginning! With the move to this temple city on September 22, he had decided that the "political maturity" of Mulayam's decision to support the UPA
 He will leave no stone unturned in praising him as it will give way to dispel the estrangement between two old friends who had become adversaries in the maze of time
 india today ne jab unase achaanak badale rukh ke bare main poocha to unhone jawaab diya, ‘‘hamaare saz sampark sutron se mujhe maaloom hua he ki mulaayam or akhilesh donon hi mere bare main hameshaa acchhee baaten karte rahe hai
 He remembers those old days when we used to spend time together
 agar koi mere bare main acha bol rahaa he to main uske bare main bura kyon boluun?’’ unhone aage kaha, ‘‘aaj bhi akhilesh kehete hai ki main hameshaa unka chachaa rahoonga, to main kaise use apana bhatija nahin maanu?’’rajnatik rukh jo bhi ho, ve is baat se acchhee tarah waakif hai ki agle aam chunaavon main sansad main koi ek party bahumat lekar nahin aane vaali, aise main mulaayam kaa ikkaa sabase surakshit rahane vaala he
 He hopes that his old friend will probably need a networker who can put all his figures on the twelfth place
 unhone bade sahi dhang se samajhaayaa, ‘‘aap do tareeke se pradhanmantri ban sakate hai: ek, aap aai
 K

 devegoda kii tarah naam bhar ke liye pad par baithe hon jinase kisi ko koi khatra na mahasoos ho; doosraa, indira gandhi yaa rajeev gandhi kii tarah aapke peeche vishaal janasamudaay ho
 i don't think Mulayam Singh is a weak leader
 har kisi ke man main unase haarane kaa dar samaaya hua he, lihaaja sabhi partiyaan ekamat se unhen chune, isaki sambhaavna kam dikhaai detii he
 Therefore, they will need the number
 ’’sirf ek hi ulajhn he
 The SP will still remember that Amar had campaigned all over Uttar Pradesh just six months ago, with one goal - Mulayam and Akhilesh do not return to power
 sapa netaaon ke kaanon main ab bhi amar ke alfaaz gunj rahe hai jo unhone matadaataaon ke kaanon main phunke the ki mulaayam ne kaise unako dhokhaa diya or ‘‘bhaawanaaon or raajnneeti, donon hi str par eemaandaaree nahin nibhaa sake
 "at the end of his speech during the election campaign, Amar would often give a warning," If the people of UP still make Mulayam Singh their king and their son Shahzada Salim, then Uttar Pradesh deserves it
 ’’ magar yakaayak amar kii boli, andaaj, or taraana kyon badale-badale najar aa rahe hai
 He says, "neither someone came to me (joining SP), nor did i step on my part," but with this he adds quickly, "bitterness has been washed away
" 
 ’’isse party prabhavit nahin dikh rahi he
 SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary appeared to be avoiding the saying, "the party does not pay any attention to his remarks
" ’’ sapa sarkaar ke ek varisht cabinet mantri ne kaha, ‘‘mulaayam kii tarif main amar kii kasheedakaari apane prati sapa ke rukh ko padhgaye ke liye kii ja rahi ranneetik koshish kaa hissaa he
 "then a member of the SP said," If Akhilesh calls him uncle, it is simply courtesy and not affection
 ’’soch-samajhakar kahi gai baaten rajnatik manch par khaali baithe thakur ke kaanon main mishri to gholne se raheen
 Amar is the only name on which even those leaders who appear to be unanimous are stuck together
 akhilesh se lekar ajam khan tak, shivpal yadav se lekar ramgopal yadav takkrisb unke khilaaf hai
 Even if Mulayam feels the urge to move towards the old friendship, he will not be ready to give a chance to raise the opposition head by bringing him back to the party
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki november, 2011 main reportron se baat karte samay us puraani dosti ke liye mulaayam singh ke munh se besakhta alavida ke shabd nikal hi pade the, ‘‘amar singh kaa adhyay khatm ho chukaa he

 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki siem nitish kumaar ke samarthan main ab isliye koi aadchan nahin dikhti kyonki unki party ke adhikansh netaa or kaaryakarta bijepi ke saath kisi vivaadaaspad mudde par anayas vivaad nahin chaahate hai
 After Section 370, Nitish Kumar realized this, so once the bill was passed, his party's tone changed
 bijepi netaa kehete hai ki mukhyamantri ko yah galatfahami nahin he ki unke virodh karne se rajya main muslim matadaataaon kaa unke prati ruukh vahi rahegaa, jo bijepi kaa muslim samudaay ke liye he
 Evidence of this is that the by-election for the recent assembly seats in the state, during which the Muslim voter was opposed to the JDU candidates despite opposition on Section 370 and RJD candidates was their first choice, so Nitish Kumar knows If you want to continue on the chair of Bihar, then it can be fatal in an election year to have a spontaneous dispute with BJP
 janata dal united ke netaa kehete hai ki philhal enarasi ke mudde par bolne or faisla lene kii koi jarurat nahin he, lekin unka kahana he ki siem nitish kumaar ke bare main 'palati maarane' jaise shabdon kaa istemaal galat he

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has completed 10 years in international cricket, and today he is undoubtedly at the pinnacle of wealth, fame and success, but behind this height is a hard struggle of years
 
 
 diavi ke ek schuli chaatr se lekar 'ranchi kaa rajkumaar' or phir world champion banane tak kaa safar kisi dantakatha se kam nahin he
 
 
 The talk is about 33 years old
 
 
 ranchi main mecon ke ek staff quarter main jashn manaa ek bachche ke janm kaa
 
 
 The head of the family was a junior management staff at Pan Singh Mekon, so the income was very low, but then mother Devaki Devi did not realize what charismatic 'mahi' would be
 
 
 uttarakhand se aakar ranchi based is parivaar main pehle se ek beti jainti or ek or betaa narendra bhi tha
 
 
 It is said, 'the promising Birwan's lips scream
 
 
 ' so, ranchi main shamali ke diavi vidyamandir ko tab apane ek chaatr par bada naaz rahane laga, kyonki usamen kuch khaas tha - maasoomiyat ke bich uske chehre par ek chamak thi or ankhon main sapane the
 
 
 Mahendra was a very good football player, but that was not his destination
 
 
 uske sapane badalane vaale the
 
 
 Say luck or someone's eye
 
 
 skool team kaa wicketiper 11veen class main ja chukaa tha, or coach keshab ranjan banerjee ko ek nae wicketiper kii talash thi
 
 
 The coach's eyes had long been on Mahendra, a sixth-grade student and goalkeeper of the school team
 
 
 darasal, mahendra piti class main cricket bhi kheltaa tha, or vahiin se banerjee uski tezi or chapaltaa ke kaayal ho chuke the
 
 
 He asked Mahendra, "you will be the wicket-keeper of the cricket team
 
 
 ?" Mahendra questioned immediately, "chance will be found
 
 
 ?" Just what was there then, the Ranchi's Jaipal Singh Stadium became the first witness of the child's ability to kiss the sky
 
 
 varsh 1997 main skool kii taraf se maahi or unke saathi shabbir hossain ne 373 ran banaae, jisamen maahi ne 213 ran kii pari kheli

 shabbir kehete hai, "vah shuru se hi big shots ke liye femes tha
 
 
 " dhoni ke coach chanchal bhattacharya kehete hai, "dhoni shuru se hi bahut disipplind ladkaa tha
 
 
 " 1997-98 ke satr main vinu mankad trophy under-16 championships main maahi kii pehali pahchaan bani
 
 
 But then there was neither IPL nor money in domestic cricket
 20 saal kii umr main hi dhoni ko is baat kaa ehsaas ho gaya tha ki unhen naukari kar leni chahie
 
 
 Few people know that Dhoni lived in a one-room house in Kharagpur and used to work as a ticket collector
 
 
 chaar saal tak vah yahaan rahe or railway kii team se cricket khelaa
 
 
 Mahi's career was fraught with struggle
 
 
 tab maahi jon abraham ke fain hua karte the or unki tarah bal bhi badha liye the, lekin sabase bade fain to the sachin tendulkar ke
 
 
 The passion for cricket was so great that once the railways issued him a notice to quit work and play cricket
 
 
 jharkhand cricket sangh ke adhyaksh amitabh choudhary kehete hai, "aapane dekha hoga ki jab dhoni ne pehla match khelaa tha, team main do wicketiper the, lekin ek baar use mauka mila, to use rokane vaala koi nahin tha
 
 
 " varsh 2004 main team india kii cap pahanane ke baad maahi se mahendra singh dhoni banane kii kahani kisi pariktha se kam nahin
 
 
 New house, 23 highspeed motorcycles, Hummer cart and uncountable wealth
 
 
 mahaj paanch saal main ek behad aam-sa aadmi 'karodon main ek' ban gaya
 
 
 In childhood, Mahi himself wrote MRF with paint on his bat, because then Sachin used to play with the bat of the same brand, but even then Dhoni did not realize that he would win the World Cup with his childhood hero
 
 
 lekin ab varsh 2011 kaa worldcup jeetne vaale captain kii zimmedaari usee cap ko dobaaraa jeetne kii he

 On Saturday, after Lt Governor Najeeb Jung sent a fax to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to return from Finland, Aam Aadmi Party ministers Satyendar Jain and Kapil Mishra went to meet Jung at his office but could not meet due to the Lt Governor not being there
 Later, a new war of words erupted on both sides

 karyaalay ne saath hi aap sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki aise samay main jab shahar swasthya sankat se jujh rahaa he, aap sarkaar mudde kaa raajnneetikaran kar rahi he
 Jung had asked Sisodia to return immediately to Finland in view of the sudden spurt in dengue and chikungunya cases in the national capital
 sisodiya adhyayan yatra par finland gaye hue hai
 The ministers waited outside the Lt
 Governor's office and said no time was sought to meet the Lt
 Governor as Jung sent an "emergency" fax to the Deputy Chief Minister and he felt that the Lt
 Governor would have to do something urgent
 mishra ne kaha, "hamase kaha gaya ki aaj chuttee kaa din he or vah karyaalay main nahin baithte
 We called him but he is not even at his house
 aisa lagata he ki vah aaj kaam karne ke mood main nahin he

 " uparajyapal karyaalay ne kaha ki yah 'afsosjanak' he ki aise samay main jab dilli ek gambhir saarvajanik swasthya sankat se jujh rahi he, nirvaachit sarkaar logon ko raahat muhaiyaa karaane kii bajaae mudde kaa 'raajnneetikaran kar rahi he
 The office said, "the Lieutenant Governor's Office is keeping a close watch on the health situation in Delhi and we are taking regular information on the situation from the Chief Secretary and Secretary (health)
 " jain ne kaha ki unhone jang se phone par baat kii lekin vah mulaakaat ke liye uplabdh nahin the
 He said, "I called his phone number but he (for the meeting) is not available

 Mishra said, "we were told that today is a holiday and he does not sit in the office
 hamane unhen phone kiya lekin vah apane ghar par bhi nahin hai
 It seems that he is not in the mood to work today
 " uparajyapal ke karyaalay ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki uparajyapal ko mantriyon ke aane ke bare main media ke jariye pataa chalaa
 The Lieutenant Governor's Office said in a statement, "since the Lieutenant Governor's Office works all days of the week, the Secretary of the Lieutenant Governor met the ministers

 All four judges were also with him at the time of his death
 unhone loya ke shav ko ambulance ke jariye latur bhi bheja tha
 Rohatgi argued that there was no reason not to trust the statements of the four judges who were named in the police report
 inke bayaan par bharosa karnaa hi hoga
 If the court does not believe his statement and orders an inquiry, then these four judges will be considered involved in the conspiracy
 medical report ke mutabikjaj loyaki maut dil ke daure se hui or chaar jajon ke bayanon par bharosa naa karne kii koi vajah nahin he
 Therefore, this petition inspired by politics should be dismissed with heavy fines

 The main city has poor connectivity to the outskirts, the roads are jammed, the parking space is low and the cost of land has become so high that it is no longer possible to take a house in the place of law
 yahi vajah he ki ab shahar main gaganchumbi imaaraton kii maang badhati ja rahi he
 The city also has no plans for this
 isi kaa nateeja he ki baapu nagar or tilak nagar jaise bahari ilaakon main bhi bahumanjila apartment rasta roke khadey dikh jate hai
 The green area in the city has barely survived and the population and number of vehicles have affected the standard of living and basic amenities like electricity and water

 Some of the suggestions and solutions that came out after talks with these planners and experts are: 1
 sarkaar ko pramukh ilaakon main un jagahon kii pahchaan kerani chahie jahaan-jahaan use gaganchumbi imaaraton ko manjuuri deni he
 All such buildings should have parking and green area space
 sankari sadakon par oonchi imaaraton ko tab tak manjuuri nahin di jaani chahie jab tak unke plot sies bade na hon
 The apartments should be cleared on large plots and a similarity in height should be decided; 2
 aabaadi or vaahanon kii saghanta, bijli-pani kaa intjaam or harith kshetra sambandhi gambhir adhyayan kiye jane honge; 3
 New colonies should be inhabited in the outskirts but they should have good connectivity with roads; 4

 It is an engine

 Dhanova, in response to a question asked about the superior in both fighters, said that it depends on how we equip it
 main aashwast hum ki hamane behatar vimaan banaaya he
 He said that there is a very good article in an aviation journal
 usamen kaha gaya he ki jeef -17 tejas kii tarah takneekee rup se aadhunik nahin he
 Therefore, JF-17 is today's fighter aircraft because they have far more squadrons than us but Tejas is the fighter of the future

 (from input language) dilli main door tu door swasthya suvidhaon ke makasad se khole gaye mohalla clinics khud hi biimaar dikh rahe hai
 The team of Delhi Aaj Tak did a reality check at several Mohalla clinics in East Delhi
 sarkaar ke vaadon auki jamini hakeekat main zamin aasmaan kaa fark mila
 Mohalla Clinic itself has been accused of Kapil Mishra Ghotle, who was a minister in the AAP government
 kya he sarkaar ke daavon kaa sach, hamaare reality check main khuli isaki pole
 
 
 They have been in the news ever since the foundation stone of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's ambitious Project Mohalla Clinic was laid
 ghar-ghar swasthya pahunchane ke makasad se satta main ai aap sarkaar ne 1000 mohalla clinics kholane kaa daawa kiya tha
 But the truth is that only a total of 100 clinics have been opened in Delhi, out of which the clinics are not open, lab facility has not yet been provided to the patients
 hamane purvi dilli kii chaar mohalla clinics kii padtaal kii or paaya ki chaar main se teen clinics main lab facility abhi tak chaalu ho hi nahin pai he
 Lack of facilities in Tahirpur Clinic First of all show you the condition of Tahirpur Mohalla Clinic
 is mohalla clinics ko khule hue teen maheene se bhi zyada kaa samay ho gaya he, lekin yahaan par aam dawaaiyon ke alaava koi bhi suvidha marizon ko nahin mil pai he
 We investigated this locality clinic and the lab assistant told the shocking truth
 yahaan par maujuud lab asistatent ne bataaya- 'yahaan lab nahin he, sirf sugar kaa basic test hota he, paas main ek mohalla clinics dilashaad garden main khulaa he, vahaan outsorcing ke zarie lab facility khuli he
 There is a GTB nearby, sending patients here
 yahaan sirf dawaai milti he'
 In order to reduce the burden from the big hospitals, mohalla clinics were opened at different places that the patients did not have to eat in the hospital for minor illnesses
 naale ke upar bana clinicalekin yahaan lab asistent ne khud kholi mukhyamantri ke daavon kii pole
 There is neither a lab facility nor the entire staff whose common patients are suffering
 lab assistant ne bataaya- 'meri dispenceri se posting he, ek din vahaan jaataa hum or ek din yahaan aata hum
 There is a shortage of manpower, doing duty in Alternate Days
 sabko maaloom he, marizon kii bheed bad jaati he
 Two days patient has to see in a day
 ' marizon kaa bhi kuch aisa hi kahana he
 a patient visiting the Mohalla clinic said, "if you write the test, you go to GTB"
 or to or naale ke upar bane tahitpur mohalla clinics se marizon ke biimaar padane kaa khatra lagaataar bana hua he
 Karan Singh, a local resident of Tahirpur, said, "these clinics have been built, but there is no facility, they do not have the power to refer them to a big hospital
" aasapaas kaa eggia aap dekhie kitna ganda he'
 The Manasarovar Mohalla clinic is sent to a large hospital for tests
 doctor ne bhi clinics kii kami ko mana, lekin system ke saamne wo bhi majaboor dikhin
 The doctor posted in the clinic said, 'it is on since March 17, nothing is here, there is no lab facility here, refer to SDN or GTB for the test
 athurity se poocha to under process bolte hai
 The patient is upset
 unhen idhar-udhar ghoomana padataa he
 'the filth around this mohalla clinic of Mansarovar Park is telling a different story, due to which the local people are also angry
 ek sthaneey vyakti camel ne bataaya, 'suvidha kuch nahin he, koi phayda nahin he, dhul mitti itani he, koi safai nahin he'
 In fact, the Aam Aadmi Party government had promised that more than 200 lab tests will be made free in these Mohalla clinics
 lekin purvi dilli ke in mohalla clinics kaa rielity check karne ke baad sarkaar ke daavon kii pole khulti dikh rahi he
 Now let you tell you the condition of Simapuri Chemohalla Clinic
 dilli upi border par hone kii vajah se yahaan ke sthaneey logon ko alag hi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 One patient told Saira, "she had made a slip and said don't come again, asking for Seemapuri's address"
 vahiin meharaj ne kaha, 'bahut pareshaani ho rahi he, abhi bhi kah rahi hai ki dilashaad colony jaao
 It is said that go to the big hospital, what is this Mohalla clinic '
 yahaan bhi lab test ke naam par sirf ikkaa dukka test hi hote hai
 The patients here are forced to eat at the big hospitals for the test
 maharashtra main bhartiya janata party(bijepi) or shivasena ke bich sarkaar gathan ko lekar khinchataan jari he
 Prior to the elections, the coalition of the two parties has been embroiled in the formation of the government
 donon raajnneetik partiyon main sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 While the Shiv Sena wants a big stake in the government, the BJP is not ready for it
 isi bich shivasena ke diggaj netaa sanjay raut ne sarkaar gathan par bada bayaan diya he
 Sanjay Raut said that BJP is the largest party in Maharashtra, BJP should be given first opportunity to form government
 agar bijepi sarkaar banane main fail hoti he to ham sarkaar banaaenge
 Sanjay Raut also showed documents during this period and said that we have majority
 sanjay raut ne dastavej dikhaate hue kaha ki dekhie sab kuch taiyaar he
 To get the magic figure with the BJP, ED and Governor House Sanjay Raut said, 'first of all BJP is the biggest party, they should get an opportunity to form government first
 ve congress or ensipi se itane logon ko le gaye or unke saath ve 105 tak hi pahunch paae
 They do the politics of ayaram-gayaram (congress NCP)
 unhen pehla avasar milanaa chahie
 He has the ED and the Governor's House to get a magical figure of 145
 iske baavjood aaj ve raashtrapati shashan kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 'but if you fail to form the government, the Shiv Sena will give a magic figure of 145
 shivasena sarkaar banane main bahut sakasham he
 We have prepared letters of support for such people who will help us in forming the government
 agar bijepi sarkaar banane main vifal rahati he to ham ise rajyapal ke paas le jaaenge
 We have a majority
 main hava main nahin bol rahaa
 Sanjay Raut showing those papers said that we have support and we will form the government
 unhone kaha, 'is dastauez ko dekhen sab kuch taiyaar he
 i will just say that we have the figure
 lekin pehle bijepi ko mauka den
 He said, "yes, there has been a lot of delay in forming the government
 bijepi sabase badi party he jise unhen sarkaar banane ke liye daanv par lagaana chahie
 They have a list of newly elected mlas, they have to hand over the list
 andeh he ki ve ise kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 The BJP seems to have failed to form the government
 yahaan governor ko sarkaar banane ke tareeke khojane kaa puraa adhikaar he
 The governor should have taken suo moto action which is not happening
 ham bhi bahut chintit hai
 'till now i have seen that nobody waits till the end of the term, before that they are only taking oath
 9 november is sarkaar kaa aakhri din he, is baar mujhe lagata he ki aakhri saans tak antim samay tak devendra fadanvis siem bane rahenge
 What Devendra Fadnavis and the Governor will do after that, what we don't know
 mausam vibhaag ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik monsoon kii hawaaon main 12 june se tehraav aa gaya he
 Due to the weakening of the monsoon strength, the monsoon rains have been confined to northeast India and the Western Ghats at this time only
 super computer ke madhyam se kii gai gananaaon ke lihaaj se yah anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki 23 june ke baadamonsunaki hawaaon main sugabugahat badhegi, lekin jis tarah kii mausami sthitiyaan ban rahi he vah nishchit taur par desh ke liye chintajanak he
 According to the general data of monsoon rains, the northern border of monsoon is currently passing through Thane, Ahmednagar, Buldhana, Amravati, Gondia, Titlagarh, Cuttack, Midnapore, Gwalpada and Bagdogra
 12 june se yah rekha yaheen par thahari hui he or mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki agle 5 se 6 dinon tak monsoon kii hawaaen isse aage badhane kii sambhaavna naa ke baraabar he
 This is because the monsoon has weakened considerably
 mausam vibhagake diarector charan singh ke mutabik ab tak hui barish ke aankadon par najar daalen to monsoon kii barish saamaanya he, lekin jab aankadon kii gaharaai main jaaen to yah khushrahmi galat sabit hoti he
 The reason is that the rains are happening in the Western Ghats and Northeast India
 western ghat par hone vaali barish maatra main zyada hoti he, lekin yah barish bahut kam samay main arab sagar main waapas chali jaati hai
 On the other hand, in case of Northeast India, due to excessive rainfall in the short time here, a flood-like situation has arisen, if we talk about the mainland of India, then the monsoon rain has not happened here as it should
 mausam vibhaag ke aankadon par najar daalate hai to 18 june tak puure desh main 78
 The average rainfall is 7 mm
 is samay tak ausatan 78
 It rains only 7 millimeters
 purv or purvottar bharat main hui barish par najar daalen to yahaan par 149
 The rainfall of 00 mm has so far been about 22 percent less than normal
 isi tarah uttar pashchim bharat main is sijan main ab tak 28
 26 against normal rainfall of 4 mm
 9 millimetre kii saamaanya barish hui he jo saamaanya ke mukaable 5 fisadi kam he
 Good rains in the south, 87 here in South India
 5 millimetre kii ausat barish ke mukaable 122
 Average rainfall of 8 mm has been recorded, which is more than 40 against the normal
 dakshin bharat main zyada barish hone kii vajah yahaan par western ghat par ho rahi jhamajham barish ko bataaya ja rahaa he, jabaki andruni hisson main barish kii maatra kaaphi kam he
 According to the Meteorological Department, by June 18, the monsoon generally reaches Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat as well as the entire Uttar Pradesh and at the same time, monsoon rains start in all areas of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
 But this time due to the weak monsoon conditions, the monsoon winds have not been able to bring West Bengal fully in its grip
 odisha kaa ek bada hissaa monsoon kii barish se achoota he, jabaki chhattisgarh kii baat karen to monsoon kii barish ek bade hisse main abhi tak nahin hui he
 The monsoon winds have not yet reached Madhya Pradesh
 gujarat main vaise to 15 june tak monsoon puure pradesh ko apane agosh main le letaa he, lekin is baar yahaan se bhi monsunandaarad he
 In eastern Uttar Pradesh, the monsoon knocks around June 15, but this time, instead of Purvaiya, westerly winds have made their home here, in these conditions it seems that Delhi is far away for the monsoon
 14 farvari ko jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale main 40 CRPF jawan shahid hue
 Terror attacks are being condemned across the country
 is mushkil kii ghadi main puraa desh shaheedon ke parijanon ke saath khadaa he
 The team of Salman Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Aditya Dhar, Diljit Dosanjh and Total Dhamaal provided financial help to the martyrs' family
 haryana kii star dancer sapana choudhary bhi shaheedon kii madad karnaa chaahati hai, lekin ve khaas vajah se aisa nahin kar paa rahi hai
 Actually, Sapna Chaudhary performed at an event in Ludhiana
 lekin organizer ne abhi tak unhen puri pement nahin kii he
 Sapna wants to give all this money to the family of the martyrs
 parformens ke liye sapana choudhary ko 8 lakh dene kii baat hui thi
 But they have been paid only 6 lakhs
 times of india kii report ke mutabik, event organisers ke puraa amount naa die jane ke baad sapana choudhary ke bhai vikaas ne police main shikaayat darj karai he

 i do not get that much time to spend with family
 saath hi devendra fadanvis ne yah bhi kaha ki vah shivasena kaa mukhpatr saamana nahin padhate
 In the conclave, Devendra Fadnavis said he had no objection to the appointment of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray as deputy chief minister
 lekin mukhyamantri pad vahi rakhenge
 Fadnavis also removed the cloud of apprehension from the question of whether or not to contest elections with Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha ki ham shivasena ke saath chunaav ladenge
 Currently, seat sharing is under discussion
 log kisi bhi tarah kii afvaahon par dhyaan na den
 Fadnavis also expressed his views on the difficulties faced by the government during the last 5 years
 unhone kaha, meri sarkaar ko giraane kii kaaphi koshishen kii gayi
 But we acted positively
 jab poocha gaya ki shivasena sarkaar kii sahyogi hote hue bhi bijepi kii aalochana karti he? iske jawaab main fadanvis ne kaha, 'agar dost pathar phenke to use phool samajhnaa chahie

 In its order, the court has allowed Tejpal to use household food, bedding and clothes during police custody
 police ne tejpal par pichley kuch dinon se jhansa dene kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Tejpal's presence at the crime branch, located more than 5 km from Panaji, is seen as an attempt to escape the public eye while being detained by the court

 Tejpal and his family members, like a man in a black veneer walked from the court premises, started shouting slogans against him

 luthra ne kaha ki tejpal jab tak police chaahegi tabatak goa main bane rahenge, apana passport or fiks diposit va anya chijen jamaa kar denge
 He also assured that Tejpal would not go to Mumbai during the investigation
 peedita mumbai main hi rah rahi he
 He said that Tejpal has no criminal record and hence he should be considered or granted interim bail
 maamle ke liye niyukt vishesh lok abhiyojak saresh lotalikar ne haalanki daleel di ki tejpal girggit kii tarah rang badal rahe hai or jaanch puri karne va unase asli kahani ugalvaane ke liye tejpal kii hiraasat jaruri he
 Lotlikar also said that the victim's statement before the judge and the CCTV footage obtained by the police provide 'sufficient clues' to confirm the victim's rape allegation
 lotalikar ne tejpal par peedita kii sachai par sawaal khadaa kar apamaanit karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya or kaha ki 'use ek aise vyakti ne ulanghan kiya jo uske pita ke samaan he

 It is called hail when you shave your head
 bangladesh ke vigyaapan main sir mundaate khilaadiyon ke liye bhi ye tis kii hi baat hogi
 Indian selectors have openly acknowledged that they too are in the pain of Indian defeat

 Government officials, however, are not ready to accept that bad roads play an important role in deaths due to accidents
 sadak mantralay ke 2017 ke aankade kehete hai ki 78
 4 percent of the accidents were caused by the driver's fault while 2 due to negligence of civic institutions
 8 fisad durghatnaayen hui thim
 The pits on the roads were responsible for only 2 percent of the accidents
 haalanki trephic visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki durghatnaon main sadakon kii kharaab dizin, haalat or trephic ke kharaab prabandhan kii bhoomika kii koi swatantra jaanch nahin hoti
 Says Baluja, "it is easy to blame the driver because most of the deaths occur on the highway, where traffic rules are rarely enforced
 ''shaayad sabhi hitdharakon kii koshishon main talmail kaa yah abhaav hi he jisane hindustan kii sadakon ko duniya kii sabase khatarnaak bana diya he
 The time has come when political leaders should accept collective responsibility and provide an environment for regular commuters in which enforcing rules and regulations is an everyday matter and not an occasional sentencing campaign

 There were earlier reports that the film would be released on January 12 next year, but after listening to CBFC, it is felt that the film cannot be released in January
 prasoon ne kaha he ki film kii vartmaan sthiti ko dekhte hue film ko certificate dene main 68 din lag sakate hai
 His statement appears to confirm media reports that the censor board has rejected the application to expedite the process of giving certificates to the film's makers
 padmavati ke ek charitra main kho gaya lakhon kaa balidaan, kai bade muddeprasun ne somvaar ko IFFI main media se baat karte hue yah kaha
 He also expressed his disappointment at showing the film to some mediapersons before submitting the film to the censor board
 unhone kaha ki agar log chaahate hai ki sensor board film par koi faisla le to unhen board ko samay, swatantraaa or maansik spes dena hoga
 He said- it may take 68 days because committees will take time to decide on it
 saadhaaran taur par film isse kam samay lete hai, lekin is film kii sthiti thodi alag he
 If people are protesting on the road, should CBFC be blamed for this? If the makers show the film to the media, is it also the fault of CBFC? But you want CBFC to decide wisely on this
 lekin ye kaise sahi faisla le saktaa he agar aap use samay or swatantraaa hi nahin denge? main film industry se hi hum isliye main filmmekars ko samajhataa hum, main sanjay lila bhansaali ko samajhataa hum, lekin ye unke bare main nahin he, yah film se ghire vivaad ke bare main he

 unhone kaha ki film par faisla lene se pehle wo sabhi samudaayon ko dhyaan main rakhenge

 sabhi dal nitiyon or gathjod ke str par apni-apni gotiyaan feet karne main jute gaye hai
 BJP is preparing to repeat 2014 on the basis of PM Modi's face
 vahiin, congress 2014 chunaav kii kadavi yaadon ko bhulaakar mahagathbandhan ke jariye modi factor ko maat dene ke liye nae sire se samikarnon ko saadhane main juty hui he
 The Modi government is surrounded by issues including inflation, unemployment
 vipaksh lagaataar hamale kar rahaa he
 All these issues are the same which BJP had succeeded in defeating UPA in 2014
 lekin tamaam koshishon ke baavjood congress or vipaksh modi sarkaar ke khilaaf mudde jameen par utaarne main abtak safal hote nahin dikh rahe
 Here we will talk about the 5 issues that led to the victory of the Modi government in 2014, but still remain the same
 vipaksh inhen muddon ko pramukhataa se uthaakar 2019 fatah karnaa chahta he
 1
 mahangaai belgaum2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne badhati mahangaai ko ek bada chunavi mudda banaaya tha
 Narendra Modi promised to curb inflation within 100 days
 aaj bijepi ke satta main aane ke 4 saal baad bhi badhati mahangaai sabase badi chunauti bani hui he
 Petrol and diesel prices have reached the highest level in history
 4 sitambar ko mumbai mempetrolki keemat 86
 And diesel 75 at a record level of 72
 74 rupee prati litre tak pahunch gai
 While Petrol 79 in Delhi
 31 or dijal 71
 34 per liter
 jabaki may 2014 main dilli main petrol 71
 41 per liter
 vahiin dijal kii keemat 56
 71 per liter
 jaahir he lagaataar badhati tel keemton kaa asar rosemara kii chizon par mahangaai ke rup main saamne aa rahaa he, lekin vipaksh ise mudda banane main abhi safal nahin ho rahaa he
 This is the reason why BJP rebel leader and former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha said that he does not understand why the opposition including Congress is not on the road due to the increased prices of petrol and diesel? 2
 rupaya jameen parrgast 2013 main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan narendra modi ne rajkot main kaha tha- bhartiya rupaya or manmohan singh donon ne apni aawaaj kho di he
 Today, the rupee is on its death bed and is counting its last breaths
 ise ek doctor kii jarurat he
 Targeting the UPA, he said that when the UPA came into power, it was promised to reduce inflation in 100 days, but now it is reversing
 gauratlab he ki us samay dollar ke mukaable rupee kii keemat 65
 56 was raised to Rs
 4 saal baad 4 sitambar ko dollar ke mukaable rupee kii keemat aitihaasik sabase oonche str par aa gai
 71 for the first time
 41 ke str par pahunchaa
 The Modi government is now blaming the international situation for the rupee and oil prices situation
 jabaki rupye ke girane se baaki chizon par bhi asar pad rahaa he
 At the same time, there is a political war on the issue of youth unemployment
 3
 Defense Deal: Like the augusta-bofors Vs Rafale 2014 elections, allegations of scam in the defense deal in the country are in discussion even before 2019
 tab agasta westland or boforce kii charchaa thi to ab rafel kii
 The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, has opened a front against the Modi government on the Rafale issue and is directly blaming PM Modi
 congress is mudde ke sahare 2019 ke chunaav main utarane kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 4
 lokapalka kya hua?manmohan sarkaar ke khilaaf chale anna andolan kii mukhya maang bhrashtachar par rokthaam ke liye lokapal banane kii thi
 In the 2014 election campaign, PM Modi raised this issue and said that soon after coming to government, laws will be made to curb black money and black money from abroad will be distributed among honest people of the country
 tab modi ne lokapal bill ke paas hone kaa credit rahul gandhi ko dene ke congress ke daawey kii aalochana bhi kii thi or kaha tha ki congress khud bhrashtachar main aakanth dubi hui he
 Today, even after 4 years of the Modi government, the Lokpal has not been appointed
 congress kii ore se lokapal chayan board main sadsy khadge lagaataar baithkon kaa bahishkaar kar rahe hai
 The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Modi government raising questions about the non-appointment of Lokpal
 isi tarah videshon se kaala dhan waapas laane kii koshishon ko bhi koi khaas safalataa nahin milanaa modi sarkaar kii 2019 se pehle mushkil badha rahi he
 However, Congress has not been able to raise these issues in a sharp way

 Juhi Chawla, who has done more than a hundred films in her career, is going to be seen in a negative role in a film for the first time
 saumik sen nirdeshit 'gulab gang' main vah netaa ke role main hai
 In the film, he faces Madhuri Dixit
 juhi se baatcheet ke pramukh anshamgulab gang ke bare main bataaen?yah aam masala film he
 We also have male characters in this film
 gaanv kii prishthbhumi par film he
 It also has a message
 yah mahila shashaktikaran kii baat karti he
 Talks against atrocities against women
 ladakiyon ko acchhee shiksha or acchhee parvarish di jaani chahie
 In this film, i played a politician with a negative shade
 aap politician or vah bhi negative, role ke liye kaise taiyaar ho gayi?saumik jab mere paas is film kaa ofer lekar aae, to mujhe laga ki unka dimag kharaab ho gaya he
 i clearly said that you have not written this role keeping me in mind
 main is tarah kii film kyon karuungi? maine unase kaha ki vah mujhe dhyaan main rakhkar dobaaraa role or script likhakar laaen, to main sochoongi
 Two to three weeks later, after softening the role and narrating it to me, i felt that there was nothing left in the character
 tab mujhe laga ki maine acchhee khaasi cheez ko gadabad kar diya
 And i told him that i will do the film, the old script
 phir diarector se kai din baatcheet ke baad mujhe laga ki yah jo script he, iske jo paatr hai, agar inhen maine or maadhuri ne milakar achche dhang se nibhaayaa, to film kii baat kuch or ho jaaegi
 Do you think your fans will like you in the negative role? i also felt that people would laugh at me and make fun of me
 lekin jab saumik ne mujhe kairactor ko vistaar se samajhaayaa to meraa vishwaas badha
 i claim so much that people will see a different kind of villain on screen for the first time
 negative kairactor kaaphi pasand kiye jate hai kya isi vajah se aapane yah role chunaa?mujhe rajjo kaa kirdaar to ofer hua nahin tha
 Madhuri Dixit was offered the role of Rajjo
 mujhe jo ofer hua, vahi maine nibhaayaa
 There is no question of becoming overbearing in this
 sach kahuun to mujhe dar lag rahaa tha ki log mujhe pasand karenge yaa nahin
 But I'm glad that people are liking me after the trailer comes out
 mujhe to yah dar sata rahaa tha ki log kahin yah na kahen ki yah kis tarah kaa dialog bol rahi he?politician kaa role nibhaana kis tarah kaa anubhav rahaa?aasaan to nahin rahaa kyonki is tarah kaa kairactor isse pehle maine kabhi nibhaayaa hi nahin tha
 For this, i took inspiration from many women leaders
 unhen baariki se objrv kar unke menerism ko apnaane kaa prayaas kiya he
 With Soumik's help, i was able to play my character
 saumik kii pehali film he, aap ne un par ekadam se bharosa kaise kar liya?saumik ne is film kii script likhi he
 Its dialog has been written
 is film ko sangeet se bhi sanvaara hai
 Apart from this, he has very good knowledge of films
 ab aisa insaan acha diarector na ho, yah to ho hi nahin saktaa
 She has done a lot of research on women empowerment
 maadhuri ke saath kaam karne kaa experions kaisaa rahaa?maadhuri best ko-actor hai
 Wonderful experience
 log maadhuri se aapaki tulana karenge ?koi tulana nahin hogi
 i am a villain here
 mujhe is film main dance nahin karnaa tha
 These days through the movement against the corrupt system, that is, there is a fight without arms, while there is a stick in the Gulab Gang? We are showing in our film that you have to go to the system to fight the system
 ab aap kis hisaab se filmein chunati hai?mujhe acchhee filmon kaa hissaa bananaa he
 i do not see if i am the heroine in the film or not
 aapke pasandida diarector koun hai?yash chopra, ajij mirza, mahesh bhatta jaise diarectors ke saath kaam karte hue maine hameshaa injoy kiya
