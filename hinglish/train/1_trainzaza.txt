 On Sunday, along with Manohar Lal and Dushyant Chautala, it was believed that the rest of the cabinet leaders would also take oath, but ministers were not sworn in at the last moment
 isi ke baad se kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki nai cabinet main kise jagah milegi or kise nahin?haalanki mukhyamantrimanohar laal khatter ne apni nai cabinetke bare main abhi pattey nahin khole hai
 However, speculation has intensified with JJP and Independents mlas as well as BJP leaders being given a place in the cabinet
 is baar bijepi ke omprakash dhankhad or captain abhimanyu sareekhe bade jat chehre chunaav haar gaye hai
 In such a situation, the BJP does not want to leave the Jat community only with the help of JJP
 isi ke maddenjar bijepi jat samudaay se kise mantri banaae isi pashopesh main fansi hui he
 Explain that there is a 90-member assembly in Haryana
 niyamon ke mutabik rajya kii cabinet main mukhyamantri ke alaava 13 mantri shaamil kiye ja sakate hai
 The BJP and JJP have formed a government together
 haalanki jejepi ke samarthan se pehle nirdaleey vidhayakon ne bijepi ko apane samarthan kaa elaan kar diya tha
 In this way, the challenge before the BJP is to keep independent mlas with JJP
 isi ke tahat nirdaleey vidhayakon main se kise mantri banaaya jaae or kise nahin ise lekar maathapai he
 If sources are to be believed, the JJP is seeking the posts of two cabinet and two ministers of state besides the deputy chief minister
 jabaki bijepi dipti siem ke baad ek cabinet or ek rajyamantri jejepi ko dena chaahati he
 In this way, the post of 10 ministers in addition to the CM remains with the BJP
 inhen main bijepi ko apane or nirdaleey vidhayakon ko cabinet main jagah dena hoga
 Not only this, BJP is also not ready to make JJP mlas who have become mlas after defeating its veteran leaders
 bijepi ke cote se ambala chhavnee se lagaataar chunaav jitate aa rahe anil vij or jagadhari se chunaav jite spikar kanvarpal gurjar kaa manohar laal kii nai cabinet main mantri bananaa lagbhag tay he

 vahiin, ahirwal ilaake ko saadhe rakhane ke bijepi nangal choudhary seat se chunaav jite dow
 Abhay Singh Yadav is considered a strong contender for the post of minister
 bhivani se ghanashyam sarraf,panchakula se gyanachand gupta, hisar se dow
 Kamal Gupta, Sudhir Singla from Gurugram and Deepak Mangla from Palwal have won the elections
 aise main bijepi apane paramparaagat votbank ko saadhe rakhane ke liye in vaisya netaaon main se kisi ek ko mantri bana sakati he
 Seema Trikha, who won from Badkhal, also remains in the ministerial race
 vahiin, bijepi agar nirdaleey vidhayakon ko cabinet main jagah detii he to gaiyr jat nayan paal ravat kii kismat khul sakati he
 Also, among the independent Jat mlas, Balraj Kundu, MLA from Meham Assembly of Rohtak and Somvir Sangwan, who is MLA from Dadri, are likely to be made ministers
 ye donon vidhayak chunaav se pehle bijepi se tikat maang rahe the
 Independents contested and won after not getting tickets from BJP
 bijepi inhen kisi bhi surat main apane se dur nahin karnaa chaahegi, kyonki inhen kii badaulat bijepi jejepi ke saath santulan banaakar rahegi
 The JJP, which forms the government in Haryana along with the BJP, wants to maintain the ethnic balance through a quota minister
 dushyant chautaala khud dipti siem bane hai or wo narnaund se chunaav jite ramkumar gautam ko mantri banvaanaa chaahate hai
 Gautam has come to defeat BJP minister Captain Abhimanyu
 aise hi tohana main devendra singh bubbly ne bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh subhash baraala ko karaari maat di he
 Ramkumar Kala, who won elections from Shahabad Markanda, is also a contender for the post of minister, but has defeated Minister of State Krishna Kumar Bedi in the BJP government
 guhala chika se chunaav jite purv rajyasabha sadsy choudhary ishwar singh or uklana se chunaav jite anup dhanak bhi mantri kii res main maane ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, the JJP will nominate whom to join the new cabinet as a minister and the BJP will agree on it

 Some websites have been targeting Apple iphone for years - Google researcher
 iphone ke software main alag alag khaamiyon kaa phayda uthaa kar ye websites inhen hack karne kaa kaam karti hai
 Google has made a claim that is surprising for crores of iphone users around the world
 darasal google ke security researchrs ne paaya he ki kuch Malicious websites kaaphi samay se iphone yugers ko torget kar rahi hai
 These websites are taking advantage of Apple's flaws
 ek taraf Apple ne nae iphone launch date kaa elaan kiya he or duusari taraf google ke researchrs ne ye bada khulaasa karke nishchit taur par yphone yugers ko sakate main daal diya he
 Google's researcher has even said that such an attack can steal iphone users' login credentials, banking passwords and even sensitive information
 Google Project Zero kii taraf se Ian Beer ne blog main likhaa he, ‘yahaan torget main koi bhedbhaav nahin tha, sirf hacked website ko visit karnaa aapke divaais par atake karaane jaisaa he or agar ye safal hota he to aapke smartphone main monitor karne vaale tul bhi daale ja sakate hai’
 Ian Beer is a member of Google's task force
 Project Zero google kaa ek project he jiske tahat nai security khamiyaan dhundhi jaati he
 Google's researcher says that there are many websites that are designed to hack iphone users only by taking advantage of the iphone's flaws
 Google Project Zero ke Ian Beer ne ye bhi kaha he ki unhen ummid he ki har hafte is tarah kii website par hajaaron baar log visit karte hai or ye kai saal se chal rahi hai
 The surprising thing is that Google's research team has found five different iphone exploration chains that affect ios 10 to ios 12
 google ne kaha he ki ye yah bhi darshata he ki ek group kam se kam do saal se iphone yugers ko hack karne kaa efort kar rahaa he
 Security researchers claim that the Apple iphone targets different flaws in such an attack
 aisa karke havers iphone ke oparating system kaa samvedansheel hissaa apane control main le lete hai or inamen mailaware install karke yujar kaa data acces karte hai
 Significantly, after such an attack, users may have to face serious consequences
 inamen password chori se lekar, banking kii jaankariyaan, lokation or duusari files shaamil hai jinhen havers acces karke yphone yugers kaa bada nuksaan kar sakate hai
 Google's team told Apple about it this year and after that the company also released a patch for it
 aapako paas bhi yphone he to aap nae apadet ko downlod karke install kar len
 Until the time of writing the news, Apple has not released any statement on this development

 america raashtrapati donald trump ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii aupchaarik prakriya shurushikayatakarta ne kaha ki white house ne soochna ko chupaane kii koshish kiamerica ke raashtrapati donald trampake khilaaf mahabhiyog kii aupchaarik prakriya shuru ho gai he
 Meanwhile, the White House has defended Trump
 white house kaa kahana he ki purv uparashtrapati jo biden ke khilaaf ukraine main jaanch shuru kiye jane ko lekar kuch bhi anuchit nahin dikhataa he
 Indeed, a confidential complaint against US President Donald Trump claimed that Trump had requested another country to intervene to influence next year's election in the US
 shikayatakarta kaa kahana he ki white house ne is soochna ko chupaane kii koshish kii
 At the same time, the White House defended Trump, saying that there was nothing inappropriate about President Trump to launch an investigation against former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine
 white house press sachiv steffni grisham kaa kahana he ki shikaayat ghatnaon kaa paroksh sangrah or press cliping ko aapas main goothne ke alaava kuch nahin he
 What's the matter? Actually, a whistleblower has made serious allegations on Trump
 daawa he ki white house ke adhikariyon ne trump or ukraine ke netaa ke bich phone kol ke transcript bain karne kii maang kii he, jisamen trump ne 2020 ke chunaav main pratidwandvi ke khilaaf ukraine se madad maangi he
 Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine's President Vladimir Zalensky to launch a corruption investigation against his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son
 haalanki donald trump ne in aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya he
 At the same time, the White House has released a rough transcript of that phone call
 bataa den ki purv uparashtrapati jo biden 2020 main america main hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav main trump ko takkar de sakate hai
 On the other hand, the impeachment process against Trump is completed in the lower house, even then it is difficult for Republicans to pass the Senate with a majority
 donald trump ko america raashtrapati ke pad se hataane ke liye 20 republican saansadon kii jarurat hogi, jo apane raashtrapati kaa hi vidroh karen

 pehle do test maichon main shandaar jeet darj karne vaale england ko ashes apane paas barkaraar rakhane ke liye ab wimbledon or shahi parivaar se jude mithkon ko apane khyal main bhi laane se bachanaa hoga
 England defeated Australia by 14 runs in the first match played in Nottingham
 iske baad usne lords main duusare test match main 347 ran se shahi jeet darj kii
 Looking at Australia's poor batting, it is believed that England will be able to retain the Ashes, but if we look at some myths, then its path will not be easy
 inamen wimbledon se judaa myth kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Britain's Andy Murray has won the Wimbledon men's singles title this time
 unhone britain kaa 77 saal kaa intjaar khatm kiya
 The last time before him was in 1936 by Fred Parry who gave Britain the Wimbledon title and that year England lost the Ashes 2-3 despite winning the first two matches
 peri ne bhi mare kii tarah teen set main jeet darj kii lekin iske baad jo ashes kheli gai usamen england acchhee sthiti main hone ke baavjood haar gaya tha
 England won the first Test in Brisbane by 322 runs and the second match in Sydney by an innings and 22 runs
 australia ne haalanki shandaar vaapasi kii or melbern main 365 ran, edilade main 148 ran or melbern main pari or 200 ran se jeet darj karke ashes jiti thi
 Now England are again 2–0
 teesraa test match ek agast se manchester main khelaa jayega
 The second myth is related to the royal family
 prince wiliam pita ban gaye hai or isse pehle jab bhi shahi parivaar kaa pehla vaaris paidaa hua tab-tab england ko ashes main haar jhelni padi thi
 Prince William's father Prince Charles was born on 14 November 1948
 australia ne us saal england ko ashes main 4-0 kii karaari shikast di thi
 Australia had won by eight wickets at Nottingham, 409 runs at Lords, seven wickets at Lords and an innings and 149 runs at the Oval
 prince charles or dyna ke pehle bete wiliam kaa janm 21 june 1982 ko hua tha
 Australia also won the Ashes that year
 australia ne brisben main khelaa gaya doosraa test saat wicket se or edilade match aath wicket se jeet liya tha
 Australia lost the match by only three runs in Melbourne but then managed to win the Ashes 2–1
 dilachasp tathy yah he ki isse pehle 1981 main england ne ashes jiti thi, jabaki iske baad agali do siries usee ne jiti
 He lost the Ashes only once, in 1982 and 83 from 1980 to 1989
 wiliam ke chote bhai prince harry kaa janm 15 sitambar 1984 ko hua lekin us saal ashes nahin kheli gai thi
 a major accident has occurred due to a bullet in the procession in Delhi, the country's capital
 baraat main chali goli ne ek ladke kii jaan mushkil main daal di he
 The case is from the Chandni Mahal area of old Delhi
 puraani dilli ke chandani mahal ilaake main shuukravaar raat kareeb 11 baje baraat main chali goli chat par khadey ladke ko lag gai
 According to police, there was a marriage at the house of a man named Munna, who lives in the area
 police ke mutabik 15 saal kaa naeem apni mausi ke ghar kii chat par khadaa hokar baraat dekh rahaa tha
 At the same time, a person named Bablu was present in the procession
 firing ke dauraan goli naeem ko ja lagi
 Naeem has been admitted to a nearby LNJP hospital in critical condition
 ghatana ke baad maukey par badi sankhya mempulicebalko lagaaya gaya
 In the night itself, the top police officials reached LNJP Hospital and met the family members of Naeem
 doctoron se naeem kii haalat ke bare main jaankaree lee
 The police have formed a team to nab the accused Bablu, who is conducting raids for his capture
 maukey se dilli police kii krime team ne khaali khoka bhi baraamad kar liya he
 If we listen to Naeem's relatives, Naeem fell there as soon as he was shot
 police ne maukey par pahunchakar naeem ko alengepi hospital main bhartee karaayaa
 After the incident, the accused escaped from the spot
 ek ore jahaan naeem alengepi hospital main zindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahaa he
 On the other hand, after this incident there is a lot of anger among the people of the area and people are demanding that the accused be arrested at the earliest

 However, the BJP, which emerged as the single largest party in the state assembly elections with 121 mlas, is looking forward to the Sharad Pawar-led party's offer of outside support
 ensipi ne sanket diya he ki vah matdaan se gaiyr hajir rahane kii bajaay sadan main alpamat sarkaar ke paksh main vot kar sakati he
 The NCP, with 41 mlas, has assured the new government to support it from outside
 shivasena ke 63 vidhayak hai or yah 288 sadsy vaale sadan main bijepi ke baad duusari sabase badi party he
 However, it will be interesting to see how the BJP gathers the necessary strength to reach the magic figure of 145 mlas in the House on 12 November
 vahiin, congress ne ravivaar ko kaha ki vah sadan main vipakshi netaa ke pad ke liye daawa pesh karegi
 The Congress has 42 mlas
 maharashtra pradesh congress samiti ke pramukh manikrav thakare ne ravivaar ko bataaya, ‘jaise hi party alaakaman vidhansabha main hamaari party ke netaa ko namit karegi
 'an official told that a three-day special session of the assembly will start from Monday in which the state governor C
 vidyasagar raav somvaar subah das baje rajbhavan main jeev pandu gavit ko vidhansabha ke asthai adhyaksh pad kii shapath dilaayenge
 The assembly speaker will be elected on November 12, after which Fadnavis will present a motion of confidence
 rajyapal ke sambodhan ke saath satr sthagit ho jayega
 Amid the demands of the ministerial post by the Shiv Sena, Fadnavis had earlier said that no minister would be sworn in before the confidence vote in the state assembly
 vishwaas mat ke baad hi cabinet kaa vistaar hoga
 Amid reports of Shiv Sena's demand for ministerial post, Fadnavis had initially said that no minister would take oath before the vote of confidence and the cabinet would be expanded only after a vote of confidence
 shivasena party ke liye vaanchit mantri padon ko hasil karne ko lekar bijepi par kathith taur par baar baar dabaav daal rahi he lekin bijepi jhuki nahin or kathith taur par shivasena se pehle vishwaas mat ke dauraan samarthan dene ko kaha he
 Input from language loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko mili karaari haar ke baad se hi rajasthan ke siem ashok gahalot or dipti siem sachin payalat ke bich tanatani kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 These news got further air on Tuesday when Chief Minister Gehlot (ashok Gehlot) was absent in the program organized on the occasion of the death anniversary of Sachin Pilot's father and former Union Minister Rajesh Pilot
 duusari taraf, kaarykram main upmukhyamantri sachin payalat (sachin Pilot) ke saath rajya ke 15 mantriyon samet 62 vidhayakon kii upasthiti se siyaasi galiyaaron main kayaason kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Of the 62 mlas present in the program, four were Bahujan Samaj Party mlas and four were independents
 ye chaar nirdaleey vidhayak is saal march main congress main shaamil ho gaye the
 a senior Congress leader said on Wednesday, 'this can be seen as a demonstration of the strength of the pilot camp, which is growing and strengthening after the party's embarrassing performance in the Lok Sabha elections'
 unhone kaha, "uske baad se vidhayak dabe va majboot swar main mukhyamantri ke rup main payalat(sachin Pilot) ko pramot kar rahe hai"
 Another Congress leader, however, said, "ashok Gehlot seems to be in a comfortable position as the Chief Minister despite all the odds
" yah teen din pehle sabit ho gaya tha, jab vah chupchaap mukhyamantri ke bangale main shift ho gaye"
 He said, "his shift to this bungalow says a lot in political language, under which he kept quiet but gave a strong message that everything is right about his post and camp"
 muslim dharmaguru moulana kalbe sadik kaa kahana he ki narendra modi musalamaanon ke liye achhut nahi hai
 Modi can be forgiven for the Gujarat riots
 agar modi apni galati maan lete hai or desh kii bhalaai va tarakkee ke liye unke paas koi vijan he to unhen aakar hamase baat kerani chaiye
 It is not that the doors are closed at all for Modi
 saath hi moulana ye bhi kaha ki modi ko unase jaldi hi baat kerani hogi kyonki do november se wo videsh yatra par ja rahe hai jiske baad wo madhya janvari tak waapas lautenge
 Excerpt from a talk by Muslim cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq
 
 
 sawaal- aapako lagata he ki narendra modi kaa gujarat dangon ke itane saal baad vijan change hua he?jawaab– ham ye nahin kah rahe hai ki change hua he ki nahin lekin agar wo aaen
 Talk to us, we are ready to talk but now we do not have time
 ham videsh ja rahe hai, or log maujuud hai unase baat karen
 Tell them your plan
 jo kuch unka plan he or ye bataaen ki gujarat main hua acha nahin hua
 The Hindus killed are also our brothers
 musalmaan maare gayi wo bhi hamaare bhai hai
 So there should be no use in killing innocent people
 sawaal– matlab narendra modi achhut nahin hai agar wo apane gunaah kii maafee maang lenjavab- agar wo apane ko badal lete hai to achhut kyon
 We are ready to hold their hand and walk together
 bas hamane bataa diya ki jo desh kaa hit saamne rakhega ham uske saath hai
 We are not with anyone who is interested in a community

 " kabhi sochaa he ki aapke dekhe bade-bade sapane sach ho jaae to kya hoga? isro (indian spes research argenijeshan) ke scientists ne bhi aisa hi sapana dekha tha jab unhone mangalayan mishan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Akshay Kumar and Vidya Balan's film Mission Mangal is the story of these dreams coming true
 film kii shuruyaat hoti he saal 2010 se jahaan isro rakesh (akshay kumaar) kii leadership main GSLV fat boy raaket ko spes main bheja ja rahaa he
 Due to a rocket disturbance, the mission has to be aborted and the mission fails
 mishan par project diarector tara (vidya baalan) kii nazren hoti hai or uski hi galati ke kaaran mishan fail hua hota he, lekin rakesh saare iljaam apane sir le letaa he
 As a punishment, Rakesh is asked to work on the Mars mission
 mangalayan mishan ke department main jaakar rakesh ko pataa chalata he ki naa to vahaan koi scientist hai or naa hi us mishan se kisi ko ummid he
 In such a situation, Tara assures him how those people can reach Mars in the right way
 phir shuru hota he mishan mangal kaa safar
 The film Mission Mangal's starcast is quite strong
 jahaan akshay kumaar bahut jununee team leader hai, to vahiin taapasi pannu, sonakshi sinha, nitya menon, kirti kulhari, sharaman joshi or senior actor ech ji dattatreya unki team ko puraa karte hai
 At the same time, Vidya Balan works as glue in this team
 wo naa sirf sabhi ko line par laati hai balki ye bhi yaad dilaati hai ki in scientists ne aakhir scientist banane ke bare main kab sochaa tha or kyon sochaa tha
 Akshay Kumar's work is good
 vidya baalan bahut si jagahon par unhen peeche chhod detii hai
 The work of learning and some of their things will definitely settle in your mind
 film kii baaki star cast ne apane kaam ko bakhubi nibhaayaa
 Director Jagan Shakti's work may not be great, but it is definitely good
 unhone science, technology or spes jaisi chizon ko bahut saral bhashaa main janata ke saamne prastut kiya he
 Better than this film, hardly anyone can explain MOM (mars Orbiter Mission) i
e
 Mangalyaan Mission so well
 film main bahut se imotional pal hai or clymex aapako apane se aisa jodta he ki aap khud par garv karne lagate hai
 The film has two songs and both are good
 editing, cinematography or graphics badhiya hai
 This film keeps you connected with yourself, which was very important
 haalanki isaki kami he ki ye slo he
 The first half of the film is very slow, but its second half is excellent
 iske alaava film main saste jokes hai, jo yaa to behatar hone chahie the yaa phir naa hi hote to acha tha
 Overall, you must definitely watch this film of Akshay Kumar and Vidya Balan

 upi ke bijepi vidhayak kii beti sakshi ne dalit yuvak se shaadi kii to uski jaan par ban ai
 But the second aspect of this love story is also important
 kyonki sakshi apane jis pita se jaan kaa khatra hone kii baat kah rahi he
 Along with being an MLA, he is also a father
 magar beti ne pita ko ye mauka diya hi nahin
 However, now the love story of Sakshi and Ajitesh stands at that crossroads
 jahaan ek rasta unki sapanom kii jindagi kii taraf jaataa he, to doosraa rasta behad khaufnak he
 The matter has reached both the court and the police
 jisaki ilaake main tuuti bolti he
 Whose face is visible
 jisaki awaz main dabangai hui karti thi
 It was broken today
 bebas sa nazar aa rahaa he
 know why? Because the camera is on
 or puure maamle kaa ek pahalu ye bhi he ki rajesh mishra vidhayak hone ke saath-saath ek beti ke pita bhi hai
 Who had raised their daughter with great Nazis and if the same daughter suddenly one day marries someone else without telling them
 to ye dard laazmi he
 In his clarification, the BJP MLA rejected the threat
 magar beti ko naa to maaf kiya or naa hi ghar waapas aane ko kaha
 The MLA did not even say a word to the son-in-law
 zaahir is baap ko apni beti kii ye shaadi kubul nahin he
 At the same time, according to the video of Sakshi going viral one after the other on social media, the MLA has put all his goons behind the scenes to find Sakshi and Ajitesh
 vidhayak ke aadmi to sakshi ko dhundte-dhundte elahabaad bhi pahunch gaye the
 Where both of them hid and married in Ram Janaki temple
 shaadi to ho gai
 Evidence witnesses and photographs are also viral on social media, but still the boy and girl are afraid of horror killing
 kyonki yahaan sawaal shaadi kaa nahin he balki sawaal he vidhayak ji kii pratishtha kaa
 Which is allegedly added to the soil by the witness
 lihaaza bareli kii bithri vidhansabha se bijepi vidhayak rajesh mishra apni hi beti kii lav story main villen ban gaye hai
 Sakshi is aware of her father's strength
 isliye elahabaad main 4 july ko shaadi karne ke baad se hi sakshi or ajitesh ke saath-saath ajitesh kaa parivaar bhi dar-dar bhatak rahaa he
 And now, through social media, the captain of Bareilly is requesting security
 dari
 
 sahami
 
 ghar se dur sakshi ko shaayad apane pitaaji kii takat par itnaa yakeen he ki wo ye maan chuki he ki ab uskaa bachanaa naammumkin he
 So she is counting the names of those people in these videos, which threatens her life
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki sakshi or ajitesh jaanate nahin the ki unke is faisle main kis tarah kii dushwariyaan aaengi
 He knew that once he got married, the age would become his enemy
 lekin in sab ke baavjood donon ne apana faisla nahin badla
 Perhaps this is what is called - what to fear if you love
 haalanki suraksha kii maang karte hue sakshi or ajitesh kaa video viral hone ke baad bareli police harakat main aa gai he
 At the same time Sakshi and Atitesh have pleaded for security in Allahabad High Court
 jisaki sunwaayee 15 july ko sunwaayee honi he
 In this battle between father and daughter-in-law, the family members of Ajitesh are suffering unnecessarily
 
 Those who are worried about the son's life being in danger
 
 At the same time, to save his life, he is also wandering around here and there
 
 Because Ajitesh's father says that he is in danger of life from mla's people

 He looks exactly like Anil Kapoor
 unke bolne kaa tone, chalane kaa tarika sab kuch anil kapur jaisaa he
 In an interview with the film Campanian, Arif said that he had come to become a Mumbai actor, not an duplicate of Anil Kapoor
 unhone kaha, lekin aaj main jo kuch bhi uske liye anil kapur kaa abhaari or ehsaanmand hum
 He told, "I am a resident of Akola district in Maharashtra
 ek baar anil kapur film kii shooting kar rahe the
 During this time i went to meet him
 ve logon ko autograph de rahe the
 On seeing me, people understood Anil Kapoor and started taking autographs from me
 is dauraan anil ne poocha ki ye bheed kyon lagi he logon ne unhen bataaya ki aapkaa koi dupliket he jo logon ko autograph de rahaa he
 During this time we met
 unhone mujhe gale lagaaya or khub pyaar diya
 "" i came to Mumbai to become an actor, not Anil Kapoor's duplicate but i am grateful for whatever i have and i owe it to him

 pepsy ne jab vahaan apni factory lagaani chaahi to vahaan ke kisaanon ne andolan kar diya
 Pepsi then tricked Punjab's farmers into making potato chips and tomato ketchup
 iske liye vah aalu or tamaato sthaneey kisaanon se hi kharidenge
 The farmers were misled and Pepsi's factory was set up
 ’ Sushma said that after that Pepsi told the farmers that their 'potato is more sweet' which is not good for making chips
 unka ‘tamaato zyada khatta’ he, jo kechap banane ke liye acha nahin he
 Then Pepsi started importing potatoes and tomatoes from abroad
 unhone kaha ki aisa hi macdonald kar rahi he
 He said that the potato that is needed to make his potato fry is not as big in India
 macdonald bhi aalu aayaat kar rahi he
 Large consignments of potatoes are imported
 sushamaa ne is vishay par charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue ek udhaaharan diya, ‘punjab sakshi he
 When Pepsi wanted to set up his factory there, the farmers there agitated
 tab pepsy ne punjab ke kisaanon ko bharamaaya ki vah aalu chips or tomato kechap banaaenge
 For this, he will buy potatoes and tomatoes from local farmers only
 kisaan gumraah ho gaye or pepsy kii factory lag gai
 ' sushamaa ne kaha ki uske baad pepsy ne kisaanon se kaha ki unka ‘aalu zyada meetha’ he jo chips banane ke liye acha nahin he
 Their 'tomato is more sour', which is not good for making ketchup
 phir pepsy ne aalu or tamaato videsh se aayaat karnaa shuru kar diya
 He said that mcdonald is doing the same
 usne kaha ki uske aalu frai banane ke liye jis aalu kii jarurat he, utana bada aalu bharat main nahin hota
 Macdonald is also importing potatoes
 aalu kii badi-badi khep aayaat kii jaati he

 haalanki rajyamantri kaa daawa he ki yah puraa maamla raajnneetik or bogus he, or unhone rajya ke shiksha vibhaag kii jaanch main clin chit milane kaa bhi daawa kiya
 Katheria said that if he is found guilty, he will resign not only from the post of MP but also from the post of MP
 ab katheria bhale hi kah rahe hon ki unki marksheet jaali mili to vah istifa de denge, lekin enditivi ko lagaataar unke hisse kii gadabadiyon ke dastauez mil rahe hai
 It is now known that there are more cases of forgery against Katheria

 katheria par aarope he ki is jaali pramaan patr kii madad se katheria ne professor kii naukari hasil kar lee
 He told the lie that he had been a guest lecturer
 haalanki katheria is puure maamle ko virodhiyon kii saazish bataa rahe hai, lekin ye ehsaas unhen bhi hoga ki adaalat main ye daleel nahin chalegi

 singhvi ne bataaya ki jaavdekar ne kaha tha ki modi ke baad araajaktaa hogi
 Such statements come after the climax of the ego
 ye sarkaar ai, me, miself vaali he
 This is panic
 sabase aniatik gathbandhan kashmir mensinghvi ne kaha ki gathbandhan ko lekar pradhanmantri apshabd bolte hai
 His ministers make fun
 inhen pradhanmantri ne duniya kaa sabase aniatik gathbandhan kashmir main pidipi ke saath kiya
 He also left that alliance in the mind and fled
 ye vampanthi vichaardhaara ke saath bhi gathbandhan kar chuke hai
 Modi himself is running a coalition of 40–42 parties
 lekin ve unako bhi saath lekar nahin chal paa rahe hai
 14-15 parties have left the alliance
 sarkaar kaa har ang ghabara gayiigar gathbandhan araajaktaa he to wo kashmir main hua or centre main chal rahaa he
 Before that happened in 1977
 aaj sachai he ki modi sarkaar kaa har ang ghabara gaya he
 The effect of this panic is that false statements are coming at this time
 mehul chokasee par ghersinghvi ne mehul chokasee ke bahaane bhi piem modi ko gheraa
 He said that now it seems that Mehul Choksi will never come to India, because he has submitted the passport
 unako waapas laane ko lekar badi-badi baaten kii gai thi
 Referring to bank fraud by 72%, Bank fraud said that only in the last year bank fraud increased by 72%

 Loans have also increased by 50 percent in this government

 Incorrect recruitment in the selection committee is being wrongly appointed in the Information Commission
 modi sarkaar ne gaiyrkanoonee kaam karne kaa ek or nayaa tarika nikaala he
 It is the effort of the government that the names that come before the selection committee should be determined in advance
 niyukti ke liye bane pool main soochna ayog ke antargat aane waalon kaa naam nahin he, jabaki unka naam he jinhone aavedan hi nahin kiya tha

 iviem hekking par bole- congress kaa lenaa-dena nahinvahin landan main iviem hekking par abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki hamane landan kii press conference ke bare main dekha or suna
 We cannot confirm or deny this press conference, but quite serious questions have been raised
 EVM ko lekar kai ashankaayen hai
 Congress has nothing to do with this press conference
 congress kaa pratinidhitiv nahin kar rahe sibbalsinghvi ne kaha ki ki congress netaa kapil sibbal ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, isliye ve gaye the
 But he was not representing the Congress
 samay kam he isliye hamane is chunaav ke liye bailat paper nahin maanga he, balki kam se kam 50% VVPAT parchiyon kii ginati kii maang kii he
 On the response of the Election Commission, the Election Commission should investigate the allegations that should be investigated
 chunaav ayog ko tahakikat kerani chahie
 Should not respond without investigation
 gopinath munde par shuja ke bayaan par unhone kaha ki ye atyant gambhir aarope he
 Accusations should not be denied without investigation, be it BJP or Election Commission
 gauratlab he ki haikar shuja ne daawa kiya he ki bijepi netaa gopinath munde ko pataa tha ki iviem hack hoti he
 That is why he was killed
 bacchon ke paas pine kaa pani nahin he, tivi or raajnneeti kii hindu muslim kii dibet aam logon ko maanav bam main badal rahi he
 In Rajsamand, Rajasthan, Nafrat drove Shambhu Lal so insane that he first cut the worker Mohammad Afrajul and then burnt him to death

 kya vaaki aisa hone ja rahaa he, bill main to he magar antim rup se hoga, abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, magar jo he us par baat ho sakati he
 On 9 November, Meera Nangia wrote a detailed article on this in The Hindu newspaper, then there was a doubt in the mind of many that whether it is really possible that banks can refuse to return our money
 iske baad 3 disambar ko scrol par shruti sagar ne is par likhaa or phir dhire-dhire kai jagahon par yah khabar chhapane lagi
 The new provisions say that the money deposited by the account holders can be used to bail out the bank
 diposit insurance and credit guarantee korporation bhi khatm kiya janaa he
 Under which the account holders have been guaranteed to return up to Rs 1 lakh
 abhi tak kanoon he ki aapke khate main agar das lakh jamaa he, bank dub gaya to sirf ek lakh tak milegaa
 Consider nine lakh rupees as drowned
 isaki jagah bainkon ko chhot di jaaegi ki wo aapkaa paisa lautaaenge yaa nahin
 If returned, in what form
 kahin lambey samay ke liye nivesh kar diya to aap gaye kaam se
 npas of banks have increased from 6 lakh crores
 bainkon ke liye yah buree khabar to hoti hi he, aapke liye bhi he kyonki bank doobenge to aapkaa paisa bhi dubegaa
 According to the new provision, drowning banks will be asked to save themselves, do not give money to the account holder
 vivaad bill ke chapter 4 section 2 ko lekar bhi he
 According to this, after consulting the resolution corporation regulator, it will decide that the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill
 diwalia bank ke jamakarta ko uske jamaa paise ke badale kitni rakam di jaae
 He will decide whether the depositor gets a particular amount or the entire money deposited in the account
 june 2017 main state bank kaa non parforming asset enpie badhkar 1,88,069 karod ho gaya he
 Like the State Bank, there are five other public sector banks whose NPA has increased so much that the Reserve Bank of India has warned them to do something immediately
 sarkari report bataati he ki aam bhartiya kaa 63 fisadi paisa saarvajaniki kshetra ke bainkon main jamaa he, 18 fisadi hi nijee bainkon main jamaa he
 If these public sector banks submerge, a large number of customers will be affected
 mira nangiya ne likhaa he ki bel-in naam se ek praavdhaan aa rahaa he jo prastaavit rejolushan corporation ko adhikaar degaa ki vah bainkon kii libility ko radd kar de yani yaa bank lambey samay tak ke liye nivesh kar de, aapako de hi na
 The money you deposit in banks with a fixed deposit or common deposit is called liability
 bank aapse vaada karata he ki aap jab paisa maangenge tab vah lautaa degaa
 Now after the arrival of this Bell Inn, it is being said that banks can refuse to give you money
 ho saktaa he ki badale main aapako kuch share de den, koi security de den
 Our colleague Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to Meera Nangia
 dilli uniwarsity kii cormas kii associat professor mira nangiya ne bataaya ki FRDI Bill agar paas hua to Resolution Corporation tay karegaa ki har customer apni jamaa puunji ke kitne hissaa kaa beemaa kara sakegaa
 We may have a different percentage in the same bank, there may be a different percentage for you
 banking vishyon par hindi main likhane vaale vibhaash kumaar shrivastav se bhi hamane is masale par or samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 It is certain that after the introduction of these provisions, the relationship between the customer and the bank will change
 kai jaankaron ne likhaa he ki bainkon main ab aapkaa paisa surakshit nahin rahegaa
 Either the money will sink or the bank will invest that money somewhere for its own sake
 jis tarah se aap kisi company kaa share kharidte hai usee tarah se bainkon main paisa jamaa karnaa ho jayega
 This is a big change
 banking association ke logon ne kaha he ki vah bhi is bill ke praavdhaan se sahamat nahin hai
 The Congress, Trinamool Congress and CPM have called the bill anti-people
 28 november ko congress ne press release jari kiya he
 The Congress has said that the health of most public sector banks is poor
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki in bainkon main jamaa aapkaa paisa surakshit nahin he
 If this bill is passed then the weaker sections of the society will be deeply shocked, their money deposited in banks will be drowned
 aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa raghav chaddha ne 7 disambar ko press conferes kar yahi ashanka zaahir kii he
 The bail-out is now going to be a bail-in for the bank
 matlab, pehle jab koi bada udyogpati kisi bank ko lone waapas nahin karata tha or bank kangaali kii kagaar par aa jaataa tha to sarkaar apni jeb se paise dekar us bank kii madad karti thi jise bel-out package bhi kehete hai
 But now through this law, a bail-in system will be made, that is, the bank will grab the money of the common people of the country which is deposited in their bank accounts and will compensate the industrialists by forgiving the loan
 or ye sabakuch aapaki marzi ke bina kiya jayega
 The comments is kram main cyprus main hue ek prayog kaa bhi udhaaharan diya ja rahaa he
 But such an experiment was not successful there
 is kanoon ke aane ke baad vahaan ke aam logon kaa paisa bainkon ne hadap liya
 After these criticisms, the government has said that the government is committed to protecting the customer's money
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne twit kiya he ki finantial rezeulation and deposit insurance bill sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke adheen he
 The government's intention is to protect the interests of financial institutions and account holders
 yahi nahin vitt mantralay kii taraf se ek safai bhi ai he
 In which it is said that misconceptions are being spread in the media about the provisions of the bail-in bill
 sansad main jo bill pesh kiya gaya he usase khataadharakon kii maujuuda suraksha main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 The bill includes new provisions for account holders in a transparent manner

 Women are not behind in anything in today's time
 vah har cheez main bad chadhakar hissaa leti hai
 But still in this society some restrictions have been imposed only on women
 udhaaharan ke liye ladkaa ladki ko sidhaa jaakar bol saktaa he ki wo use pasand karata he lekin vahiin cheez pehle ladki nahin kah sakati kyonki ye samaaj ke niyamon ke khilaaf he
 But today's digital age has brought a lot of positive changes in the lives of women
 jeen haa, dating ap mahilaon ko apni pasand bataane kaa adhikaar de rahi hai
 Giving them the freedom to choose their partner of choice and above all giving them a big platform to express their feelings
 antarrashtriya mahila diwas ke maddenjar Shaadi
 com has done a unique survey
 unhone mahilaon se poocha ki kya wo sabase pehle purushon ke saamne apni dil kii bhavanaaen vyakt karnaa chaahati hai
 On this question, 84 percent women said that they are ready to take initiative before men
 itnaa bada akda ye bataane ko kaaphi he ki aaj kii mahilaayein apni bhavanaayen vyakt karne se naa to sharmaati hai naa jhijakati hai
 Let me tell you, dating apps have a big hand behind this change
 ji haa dating eps ek aisa madhyam ban gai hai jahaan mahilaayein naa sirf apane pasand kaa saathi chun sakati hai balki unase baat bhi kar sakati hai
 Currently, three dating apps are very popular in the country - Bubble, Tinder and Wu
 bataa den, babal ap par apana saathi chunane kaa sabase pehla adhikaar mahilaon ko diya gaya he
 At the same time, 'woo' is an app where women can talk with their partner of choice and while doing so their personal number will not be shared with that person
 is badalte maahaul ke bare main mubani kii ashvini scindia kahati hai ' mujhe mere parivaar or dost hameshaa yah naseehat dete hai ki mai ladakon ke saamne apni ichchhaaon ko zyada khulkar prakat naa kiya karun
 But i understand why do we expect boys every time to express their wishes first? Shouldn't it be from both sides? 'in today's time, it is enough to convince women to ask this question that now women do not want to tie themselves in any kind of restrictions
 isi baat ko aage badhaate hue manovaigyanik harish shetty kehete hai ' mahilaon kii yah soch unke badhate aatmavishvaas kii taraf ishaara karti he
 In today's time, dating is not a wrong thing and both men and women should have freedom
 or agar mahilaayein kabhi pehle pahal karen to use kabhi tedi najar se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 By the way, these dating apps have at least empowered women and also freed them from those taunts of society
 babal kii global diarector of stretigi priti joshi ke mutabik soshal media kai myanon main mahilaon ke liye surakshit nahin he, isliye hamen aisi ap kii aavashyaktaa he jo mahilaayein istemaal bhi kar sake or unki suraksha par asar bhi naa pade
 Let me tell you, 'bubble Dating App' has all these features

 bhartiya rigerv bank ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki desh main 70 hajaar karod rupee cash kam he
 However, SBI Research has reversed its claim yesterday
 apni nai report main esbiai ne is cash kii killat ko satahi qaraar diya he
 SBI Research has released another report
 isamen usne kaha he ki disambar timahi ke mukaable march timahi main atm se paise nikaalane main giravat ai he
 Due to this there has been a shortage of nominal cash
 esbiai ne apni report main kaha ki vitt varsh 2018 kii duusari chamahi menetm se nikacimen 12

 9 per cent and 8 in the third quarter
 8 fisadi par tha
 Withdrawal in the fourth quarter though 0 compared to the third quarter
 5 fisadi kam rahi
 The new report says that ATM withdrawal is a common phenomenon in the fourth quarter
 aise main ise cash kii killat se nahin joda ja saktaa he

 SBI said in its report that an average of 2 every month at atms across the country
 10 lakh karod rupee nikaale jate hai
 The report states that cash shortages depend on many things
 ise tay karne ke liye yah bhi dekha jaataa he ki desh kaa nominal iconomic growth kya he
 Along with this, it is also seen how much cash people have and how much digital transaction has increased in the country
 maaloom ho ki pichley kuch dinon se bihar,uttarakhand, madhya pradesh, gujarat samet desh ke kai rajyon main atm se paise nahin nikal rahe hai

 The blame for the decision to arrest Anna is being blamed entirely on the Delhi Police, in the style in which the Congress acts, when the party strategists are proudly claiming that Rahul's decision to release Anna Taken from nayaa netaa jab apane pehle bade sankat kaa saamana kar rahaa he, to uski khatir tathyon ko tod-marod kar pesh karnaa bhi shuru kar diya gaya he
 Anna and then Manmohan and his lawyer advisers- Sibal, Chidambaram and Khurshid's spontaneity to get out of this mess in judicial custody symbolize a decisive overthrow of the Prime Minister's power
 jaahir taur par, pradhanmantri or unke pasandida vakeelon ko hosh main laane ke liye rahul, jo hameshaa hi enjio hitaishi rahe hai, kii saamaajik jaagrukta kii jarurat padi
 Yesterday, the Prime Minister met Manmohan with Pranab Mukherjee, Ambika Soni and Janardan Dwivedi after the flag hoisting ceremony at the Congress Party headquarters on Independence Day
 ek party padaadhikari ne kaha ki rahul ne bahes main ulajhne vaale andaaj main unase kaha, ''baba ramdev or anna hajaare main fark he
 "A cabinet minister clarifies," Rahul did not want Anna to be treated in the same way as a thug, as was done to Ramdev
 duusare shabdon main, aparaadhiyon kii khoj jaisaa na kiya jaae
 Rahul was also critical of some leaders who were making allegations of corruption against Anna
 apane saathiyon ko sidhe taur par galat bataate hue unhone kaha, ''agar koi vyakti doshi tehraaya ja chukaa he, to kya vah virodh karne kaa apana adhikaar kho baithta he? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bolne ke pehle hamamen se harek ko yah kahana hoga ki ham bhrashtachar ke chote se maamle main bhi shaamil nahin rahe hai
 "later, at the meeting where the decision was taken to release Anna, a trio of legal scholars were nowhere to be seen
 is baithak main rahul, manmohan, mukherjee or ahamed patel shaamil the
 Chidambaram was informed of the verdict
 aksar anmane netaa kahe jane vaale rahul ne, jo uttar pradesh ke behad ilaakon main yaa vanchit adivasee kii charpai par apane saamaajik agenda kaa vigyaapan karne main zyada sahaj dekhe gaye hai, ne mukhya bhoomika khud le lee
 But the power of the powerful Rahul was not enough to counter the power of the streets, where the noise emanating from Anna was retained by the new generation and which brought back memories of the JP movement of the 1970s, which Gave birth to a new socialist system of leadership in the form of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav
 yah romaaniat, vidroh or chintaa kaa ek sir chadhakar bolne vaala mishran tha, jisamen kochi se kolkata, bangaloru se ahmedabad tak ke log sadakon par aakar dilli kii taanaashaahee ke khilaaf virodh jataa rahe the
 These people, united by the social networking media, the country's most effective way to unite the masses, frightened the besieged Delhi by proclaiming their solidarity with Anna
 gajiabad ke 31 varshiya shyaam kumaar kehete hai, ''agar ek vyakti ham sabake liye kehane kaa saahas dikhaa saktaa he, to ham kam se kam itnaa to kar hi sakate hai
 '' India Against Corruption activists organized 55 rallies in Mumbai, and the 'I Am Anna Hazare' caps priced at Rs 100 became hugely popular
 bangaloru main 'awek, arise and stand ap for india' abhiyaan ne logon ko subah das baje ek mook virodh main aane kaa aahvaan kiya
 This situation turned into a non-equal match between a few frightened people imprisoned in a wakened India and a dream world of their invincibility in South Block
 sandesh manmohan tak jarur pahunch gaya hoga- unke istemaal kii miyaad ke khatm hone kii tithi chetavanee dene vaale andaaj main najadik aa chuki he
 The agony of isolation and the inevitability of going out in vain could not be lessened by the opportunistic consent of the allies
 rakanpa, jise shuchita or rajnatik gunon kaa adarsh shaayad hi mana ja sake, ke netaa di
 P
 treepathi kehete hai, ''chunki anna ne virodh kii loktantric seemaa paar kar di thi, isliye sarkaar ke paas koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 "NCP leader Sharad Pawar has been the target of Anna's campaign
 lalu prasad bhi, bhrashtachar ke masale par jinka apana byora shaayad hi udhaaharan dene laayak ho, rajnatik inaam kii ummid main sarkaar kaa bachaav karne daud pade
 Grateful Chidambaram also thanked him
 baaki sahyogi dalon kii chuppi or bhi zyada mukhar thi
 Fallible Manmohan is also being deprived of the consolation of bureaucracy

 Manmohan, standing alone in this area of sunset, must have realized his utter disbelief that on the 65th birth anniversary of India's independence, he is the most exposed face of the regime that is afraid of giving freedom to its own people

 " a post shared by Fawad a Khan (@ fawadkhan81) on Mar 9, 2016 at 9:40 am PST bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh evam grih mantri amit shah (amit Shah) ne ravivaar ko tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ko vikaas evam saamaajik samarasata ke maarg main baadhak bataaya
 Shah said that whatever is a misdeed, when it is released, it is not opposed but it is welcomed but there was so much opposition against the removal of Triple Talaq
 iske liye tushtikaran kii raajnneeti, uskaa bhav jimmedaar he
 Taking a dig at the Congress, he said that due to the habit of coming to power for years and years on the basis of vote bank of some political parties, there were misdeeds like triple talaq in the country
 is desh ke vikaas or saamaajik samarasata ke aade bhi tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ai he
 In his address on the subject of "ending Three Divorces: Correcting a Historical Mistake", Amit Shah said, "the politics that Congress started after the 60s and the other parties also followed it, the effect of the country
 Democracy has a bearing on social life and the upliftment of the poor
 2014 main is desh kii janata ne narendra modi ke netritv main bhaajapa ko purna bahumat dekar tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke ant kii shuruuaat kar di
 Shah said that the politics of appeasement has also come in the way of social harmony and development of the country
 iske paksh main baat karne vaale kai tarah ke tark dete hai
 At its core is vote bank politics and the politics of gaining power by taking shortcuts
 unhone kaha ki jo abhaav main ji rahaa he, jo garib-pichhadaa, wo kisi bhi dharm kaa ho
 Take up what has been left behind in the development phase, the society will automatically move forward on the all-inclusive and all-inclusive path
 shah ne kaha ki bagaiyr tushtikaran yah sarkaar samavikas, sarvasparshi vikaas, sarvasamaveshi vikaas ke aadhaar par paanch saal chali
 On this principle, in 2019, the people of this country have given a mandate to Narendra Modi again to free the country from appeasement forever
 unhone kaha ki isi bahumat ke aadhaar par bhaajapa kii narendra modi sarkaar ne teen talaak kii kupratha ko khatm karne kaa kaam kiya he

 com / kjbskjimc2 janata dal (united) kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak 9 june ko patna main hogi
 The meeting is scheduled to take place after the Janata Dal (united) president Nitish Kumar turned down the bjp-led nda's offer of symbolic participation in the central government
 jadyu ke pravaktaa ke si tyaagi ne somvaar ko kaha ki rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak isliye ho rahi he ki chunaav ayog ke nirdesh ke mutabik santhnik chunaavon evam anya prakriyaaon ko oktober tak puraa karnaa he
 He said that it should not be viewed with much political prism
 jadyu ke adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apane sahyogi dal ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke matbhed se inkaar kiya he
 However, recently his decision to include 8 mlas of his own party in his government and not to include any BJP mlas is being speculated that the two parties are in a tizzy, while K
C
 Tyagi says that his party is and will remain part of the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar part-2 ke cabinet main sahyogi dal se ek-ek mantri banaae jane ke prastaav ko nitish kumaar ne naamanzoor kar diya tha
 Nitish had said that there should be proportionate participation in the alliance, not symbolic
 iske baad nitish kumaar ne 2 june ko apane cabinet kaa vistaar kiya
 Bihar Governor Lalji Tandon administered the oath of office and secrecy to the eight new ministers, but the JDU included only its own ministers in the cabinet, which did not include mlas of the ally BJP
 bhaajapa ke cote kaa ek pad khaali padaa he, lekin uske baad bhi uske ek bhi mantri ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 In such a situation, the question is that JDU did not find a place in Modi cabinet, so BJP MLA was not given a place in Nitish Kumar's cabinet

 On one hand, India is moving forward on the path of development, on the other hand, heavy traffic jams on the roads seem to be hindering the way of progress

 Most cities in Europe are included in the top 20 countries compared to other continents
 ielarex ne har din ke zyada trephic jam or kam trephic jam ke bich ke antar ke aadhaar par is report ko taiyaar kiya he
 The ranking of cities is based on the population of that city and the delays caused by jams

 Film Name: chowrangadirector: Bikas Ranjan Mishrastar Cast: Sanjay Suri, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Soham Maitra, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Swatilekha Sengupta, Arpita Pal, Anshuman Jha, Ina Saha Duration: 1 hour 26 minutescertification: a Rating: 3
 5 starbikas mishra, ek screenriter ,critic ke saath saath ab film diarector bhi ban chuke hai or unhone apni pehali film 'chauranga' ko kuch saal pehle hi diarect kiya tha
 Which was also screened at different film festivals in the country and abroad and the film was appreciated by the audience
 film ko kai awards se bhi sammanit kiya gaya he
 Finally 'chauranga' is now ready for release, let's review this film based on true events on the background of Bihar
 kahaneeyah kahani bihar ke ek gaanv ke 14 saal ke ek dalit varg ke ladke santu (soham maitra) kii he jo gaanv main apane paaltu boar kii dekh bhaal karata rahata he lekin uski tamanna he kii wo apane bade bhai bajrangi (riddhi sen) ke saath skool jaakar padhai kare
 Santu hides on a jamun tree daily and beholds Mona (ina Saha) passing by on a scooter, which he also loves
 bajrangi or santu kii maan dhaniya (tanishta chatarji) us gaanv ke dabang dhaval (sanjay suri) ke ghar kaam karti he or dhaval uske bade bete kii padhai kaa kharch uthaata he jiske badale main dhaniya ke saath shaareerik sambandh bhi banaata rahata he
 The story then moves on and when Bajrangi comes home on vacation, he asks her to express love to Mona in the wake of her brother's feelings
 phir alag alag ghatnaon ke bich film main anokhe mode aate hai, or aakhirkaar kya hota he, use jaanane ke liye aapako theatre tak janaa hoga
 The script of scriptfilm is based on the times when there was caste division in the society, people from the downtrodden were not allowed to go to the temple, were kept away at home, and there are many moments in the film when you hate this division
 It also happens as if Santu refuses to be asked to touch Dhawal's leg during a scene
 film kaa balldrop or shooting karne kaa dhang bhi kahani ke saath bakhub jaataa he
 Ramanuja Dutta's cinematography is amazing, which keeps you tied to the story and makes you think
 abhinavbhinay ke maamle main donon yuva actors riddhi sen or soham maitra ne saraahneey kaam kiya he, sanjay suri ne dabang kirdaar nibhaane main koi kami nahin chodi he or maanjhi huyi adaakara tanishta chatarji ne bhi umdaa kaam kiya he
 Tannishta plays the role of an helpless mother on screen in an effortless manner
 baaki kalakaaron jaise dhruthiman chatarji, swatilekha sengupta ,arpita paal, anshuman jha ne bhi kirdaar ke hisaab se acha kaam kiya he
 The background score of the musicfilm is kept accurate according to the scene
 gaanv ke alag alag pahar ke maddenjar hi sangeet, kahani ke saath ghul mil jaataa he
 Why see if you like stories based on true events and ground reality, like to watch films being honored by different countries along with India at film festivals, and if you are an 'adult' then you must watch 'chowranga'

 While the Congress has tried to strike a balance by taking down 15 Muslim candidates, the BJP has reduced its quota to only one Muslim

 congress ne is baar bhi inamen se zyaadaatar siton par apane muslim chehron ko maidan main utaara he
 But on the other hand a large number of Muslim candidates are also contesting from these seats, who are either independents or are associated with any party other than congress-bjp
 aise main satta vaapasi ke liye sangharsh kar rahi congress ke liye ye ummidavaar mushkil kaa sabab ban gaye hai
 125 minority candidates in 16 seats, out of a total of 382 candidates in 16 seats in Muslim majority seats, 125 come from minority communities

 maman singh ko 69278 vot mili the, jabaki fazal hossain ko 31284 or amamuddin khan ko 29172 vot mili the
 Similarly, Ramgarh seat bjp's Gyan Dev Ahuja defeated Congress candidate Zubair Khan by 4647 votes, while the other minority candidates got a total of around eight thousand votes
 is baar ramgarh seat se jubair khan kii patni ko mauka diya gaya he
 Similar results were also seen on Tonk seat
 yahaan se bijepi ummidavaar ne 30343 maton se jeet hasil kii thi, jabaki duusare number par congress ke baagi saud saidi rahe the, jo nirdaleey chunaav lade the or congress pratyaashee jakia ko 21645 vot mili the, jo tisare number par thim
 The remaining minority candidates also received around two and a half thousand votes

 These seats did not win a single candidate on the Congress ticket last time
 habiburrahman ke rup main bijepi ke tikat par nagaur se iklaute muslim ne baaji maari thi
 This time Congress has given ticket to Habibur Rahman
 aise main phir ek baar najar is baat he ki kahin alpsankhyak ummidavaaron kii adhik sankhya khel na bigaad de

 Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal said on Tuesday that the IIT committee will take any decision regarding the eligibility standard for appearing in the IIT Joint Entrance Examination and it is not within the purview of the government to take a decision on the subject

 "he said" the Government of India has no role in setting the eligibility standard and any report about 80 percent marks required in 12th standard as eligibility standard for appearing in the IIT Joint Entrance Examination is baseless
 ’’khabaron par safai de rahe the sibelasibbal media main ai un khabaron par pratikriya vyakt kar rahe the jisamen unka hawala dete hue somvaar ko kaha gaya tha ki iaiti sanyukt pravesh pariksha main baithne ke liye paatrata maanak ke rup main 12veen kaksha main 80 pratishat ank ko jaruri banaaya ja saktaa he
 Sibal said, "only one decision has been taken by the IIT Council according to which the iits will submit a report by January 2010 to make JEE viable
" ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘yah puri tarah se unka nirnay he ki paatrata maanak kya hoga
 IIT Council itself will decide what the criteria will be in this class in 12th standard
 ’’ unhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa is vishay par koi dakhal nahin he or mantralay kisi bhi sthiti main, pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se koi nirnay nahin kar sakati yaa nirnay ke liye prastaav pesh kar sakati he
 Sibal has put a stop to Nitish Kumar's concern that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has written a letter to Sibal as a protest after reports in the media about the eligibility standard for IIT Joint Entrance Examination
 nitish kumaar ke patr kaa jawaab dete hue sibbal ne kaha ki ‘‘kathith prastaav astitv’’ main hi nahin he
 He said, "in view of this, i want to put an end to all your concerns in this regard as there is no proposal like the concerns expressed in your letter
 ’’ sibbal ne aage likhaa ‘‘sambhrant varg ke chaatro ko protsaahit karnaa or samaaj ke kamjor varg ke chaatro ke saath bhedbhaav karne kii dharna puri tarah se galat he

 The fate of distressed leaders in Pakistan, including President Asif Ali Zardari, will be decided on Monday when the Supreme Court will hear a memo on the case and a libel related to the reopening of corruption cases against those with influence
 pareshaaniyon main ghiri sarkaar ne samarthan ke liye sansad kaa ruukh kiya he
 The National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, is understood to be voting tomorrow on a resolution seeking approval and support on efforts by political leadership to strengthen democracy
 ek ore jahaan sansad is prastaav par vichaar karegi vahiin duusari ore supreme court kii 17 sadasyeey peeth rasookh vaale logon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko phir se kholane sambandhi ek pariwaad par sunwaayee phir se shuru karegi
 In 2007, the cases of corruption against influential people were closed by the then military ruler Pervez Musharraf under the National Reconciliation Consent Ordinance (NRO)
 pakistan main pichley saal ashankit sainya vidroh ko rokane ke liye america se madad maangane sambandhi rahasyamay memo kii jaanch ke liye sheersh adaalat dwaara gathit ek nyaayik ayog kal bhi sunwaayee jari rakhega
 pakistani-american industrialist Mansoor Ijaz made this memo public and created a storm in political circles
 ijaaj kal ayog ke samaksh gavaahi dene vaale hai
 However, doubts remain regarding his arrival in Pakistan
 pichley saptaah sheersh adaalat ne chetavanee di thi ki agar sarkaar enarao mudde par uske aadesh kii avagya karti rahegi to pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani or raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja sakati he
 The court had said that Gilani cannot be an honest person due to not honoring the oath taken while assuming office
 sheersh adaalat ne yah bhi chetavanee di thi ki agar raashtrapati apane pad sambandhi shapath kaa ulanghan karte hai to unako bhi isi nattejey kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Amid mounting pressure from the judiciary, the government is trying to avoid a confrontation with the powerful military in the memo
 sheersh adaalat ne sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani kaa maamle kii swatantra jaanch karaane sambandhi anurodh sweekaar kar liya or sarkaar kii yah daleel thukraa di ki yah jaanch ek sansadeey panel dwaara karai jaani chahie
 The confrontation between the government and the army reached a peak last week when Prime Minister Gilani said that the army and intelligence chiefs had acted in an 'unconstitutional and illegal' way by filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court on the memo issue without the government's approval
 kuch din baad sena ne is par kadi pratikriya jataate hue bayaan diya ki pradhanmantri kii tippaniyon ke gambhir nattejey ho sakate hai
 In response, Gilani sacked Defense Secretary Lieutenant General (retired) Khalid Naeem Lodhi, who is believed to be Kayani's confidant
 pradhanmantri ne un par ‘kadachaar’ or sarkaar tathaa sena ke bich galatchhemiyaan paidaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 During the standoff between the government and the army, Gilani tried to reach the army yesterday, but Kayani is said to have taken a tough stand
 vah chaahate hai ki pradhanmantri sena ke liye gambhir samajhe jane vaale bayaan waapas le
 Gilani said that all establishments would be allowed to play their own roles
 sheersh adaalat ne enarao radd karne ke baad se hi sarkaar par dabaav bana rakhaa he
 In 2009, President Zardari and 8,000 others benefited from the NRO
 supreme court kaa sarkaar par dabaav he ki vah swiss adhikariyon ko jaradaari ke khilaaf dhanshodhan ke maamle phir se kholane ke liye patr likhe
 But the government refused to do so, stating that the president was exempt from the constitution
 jaradaari khud kah chuke hai ki sarkaar tab tak swiss adhikariyon se sampark nahin karegi jab tak vah pad par hai kyonki yah kadam unki divangat patni purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto ke khilaaf sunwaayee jaisaa hoga
 Benazir was also among those benefiting from the NRO
 sattarudh pakistan pipuls party ke kuch sahyogiyon or purv mantri aitjaaj ahasan jaise party ke kuch netaaon kaa suzav he ki sarkaar maamle phir se kholane ke liye swiss adhikariyon ko patr likh kar apane upar pad rahaa dabaav kuch kam kar sakati he
 Ahsan said yesterday that any such move would not have any effect on the President as he was also exempt from Pakistan under Vienna treaties

 Many mythological stories are told about Chhath
 jaise ye, ‘krishna ke bete shamb ko apane sharir-bal par bada abhimaan tha
 With harsh penance, when the sage Durvasa came to meet Krishna, Shamba laughed whether there was a body or a thorn
 to shamb ko rishimukh se shraap mila- ja, tere sharir ko kusht khaaye
 Shamb got the disease, the medicine did not work, then someone told about Suryaradhan
 shamb rogamukt hua or tabhi se kaaya ko nirogi rakhane ke liye suryapuja matlab chhathpuja kii reet chali

 But the truth is that this festival which is celebrated in many parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is not related to Panditji's 'pothi', but to the 'anchra' of Panditin

 com / rpcimbxchc — Bhuvneshwar Kumar (@bhuviofficial) October 5, 2017 china se seemaa vivaad ke bich border par tainaat hone vaale ITBP ke javaanon ko bade str par chini bhashaa seekhney kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya jayega
 Now you will see the ITBP jawans speaking in Chinese language like 'ni Hao' i
e
 'namaskar' and 'hui Ku' i
e
 Go back
 is abhiyaan isliye chalaaya ja rahaa he taaki border vah chini sainiyon kii bhashaa ko bhi samaj saken
 Sources reveal that, for the last 55 days, ITBP personnel guarding the India and China border will be taught Mandarin, Chinese language, between the Chinese Army and the Indian Army's forces operating in Doklam near Sikkim
 ITBP iske liye musuri ke training institute main ek department khol rahaa he, jisamen chini bhashaa jaanane vaale ITBP ke adhikariyon or javaanon kii tainaati shuru kii ja chuki he
 In the first phase, 12 people will be deployed who have already learned Chinese-language Mandarin
 jaankaree ke mutabiq vartmaan samay main 200 se 250 adhikari or jawan jeenyu se chini bhashaa sikh chuke hai
 These learned officers and jawans have been deployed by ITBP at different places along the border
 abhi china-bhaarte ke bich seemaa par hone vaali baatcheet ko samajhane main yahi jawan madad karte hai
 But in the coming time and all the bop will be deployed to know Chinese language and officers
 aapako baat den ki jab bhi chini sena kii taraf se ghuspaith kii jaati he to chini sainikon ko ITBP laal rang ke poster dikhaati he jisamen likhaa rahata he 'go Back' isi tareeke ke postaron kaa istemaal kai baar hota he
 When the team of 'aaj Tak' visited the Rimkhim post near Barahoti, at that time also the ITBP jawan of India showed the red poster and told how those people used such posters to send back the Chinese soldiers
 Use chini bhashaa seekhney ke peeche kaa uddeshy!sutara bataate hai ki chini bhashaa mandarin ko seekhney ke pichheshithbhf kaa maksadghuspaith ke dauraan unki bhashaa ko sahi dhang se samajhnaa he
 There is also a purpose that Chinese soldiers talk in many ways during infiltration which our soldiers do not understand
 yahi vajah he chini bhashaa na samaj paane ke chalate jawan varisht adhikariyon ko soochna bhi nahin de sakate ki aakhir kis uddheshy se chini sainikon kii ghuspaith hai he
 The Indian Army already teaches Chinese to some of the jawans deployed in the China border
 gujarat rajyasabha chunaav kaa ran tham chukaa he
 Due to the two big faces of the two biggest parties of the country, this election became very special in place of the common people and the countrymen kept waiting for the election results after spoiling the sleep
 teen siton par hue chunaav par ek seat kaa dangal is kadar tha ki mangalvaar ko takreeban 10 ghante hivoltage drama chalaa
 The BJP won two seats in the election and the Congress won one, but the Congress is discussing one seat
 bijepi ne is seat ko hathiyaane kaa bharpoor prayaas kiya lekin unke haath haar hi lagi
 Actually, this fight was not about the Rajya Sabha seats
 yah ladaai thi do 'manageron' kii
 On one side was Amit Shah, the bjp's most successful manager, on the other side was Ahmed Patel, the manager of Congress and political advisor of Sonia
 donon kaa hi grih rajya gujarat hi he
 In such a situation, Shah wanted to give a big message to the country and Congress by defeating Ahmed Patel in his house
 vahiin duusari ore congress chaahati thi ki kuch maheenon baad hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle vah bijepi ko tagdi sikh dene ke saath janata ko congress kii takat kaa ehsaas karana chaahati thi
 For this reason, this Rajya Sabha election was a question of prestige for both managers as well as both political parties
 bijepi ne kaaphi pehle shuru kar diya tha 'kamjor congress' mishanrajyasabha chunaavon ke maddenjar partiyon ne apni jeet pehle hi sunishchit kerani shuru kar di
 The BJP was already eyeing Shankar Singh Vaghela, who was angry with the Congress for a long time
 janmdin ke din waghela ne is baat kaa elaan bhi kar diya
 In fact, the Congress was already haunted by the fear of cross voting in Rajya Sabha elections
 isi vajah se usne waghela ke par katarne kii taiyaari kar lee thi
 After the departure of Vaghela, all the Congress mlas began to resign swiftly
 congress chhodane vaale 6 vidhayakon main waghela ke samadhi, congress ke chif vip or rajyasabha seat ke liye bijepi ke tisare ummidavaar balavant singh rajput bhi shaamil the
 The notification was issued on July 22, tell you that the battle started on July 22, when notification was issued for the three vacant seats in the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat
 kyonki congress ke ahamed patel or bijepi ke do saansadon, surendra patel or praveen nayak kaa agast main kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa tha
 Before that the election process had to be started
 28 july ko bijepi ne bichaai antim bisatnamakan ke aakhri din bijepi ne apni do siton kii jagah teenon siton par ummidavaar khadaa karne kaa faisla liya
 He topped BJP President Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani on two of its seats, besides the third seat which was in the Congress camp and in the name of Ahmed Patel, for this, BJP left the Congress and named Balwant Singh Rajput in the party
 
 mjedaar baat yah thi ki balavant singh rajput ko kabhi ahamed patel ne hi gujarat congress main aage badhaayaa tha or ab ve unke saamne hi chunaav lard rahe the
 Congress started the mission 'MLA Rescue' Ahmad Patel needed only 45 votes to enter the Rajya Sabha for the fifth time
 istifon se ghabaraai congress ne apane vidhayakon ko sabase pehle bengaluru bhej diya or unhen kadi nigaraanee main rakhaa
 The Congress banned any of his talks
 idhar rajyasabha, loksabhaa se lekar chunaav ayog or sadakon tak usne bijepi par 'horse trading' kaa aarope lagaana shuru kar diya
 On 1 August, the Election Commission gave a 'blow' to the Congress, which was struggling with the resignation of the legislators, on 1 August, the Election Commission gave a strong blow
 chunaav ayog ne saaf kiya ki rajyasabha chunaavon main chaar ummidavaaron ke alaava paanchavaa vikalp NOTA bhi hoga
 The Congress also went to the Supreme Court against this decision but got desolation from there
 darasal congress ko dar tha ki uske vidhayak ahamed patel ke khilaaf nota kaa vikalp chun sakate hai
 On August 2, the Income Tax Department conducted a massive raid on the bases of the owner of the resort where the Congress MLA stayed in IT Redbengaluru and Karnataka Energy Minister DK Shivakumar
 red ke dauraan adhikariyon ne congress vidhayakon ke kamaron ke alaava vahaan maujuud sabhi vaahanon kii bhi talaashi lee
 According to sources, the Income Tax Department suspected that a large amount of cash was hidden in the resort
 rahul gandhi par hamalaais bich 4 agast gujarat daure par gaye congress upaadhyaksh kii gaadi par pathar se hamalaa bhi hua haalanki is ghatana kaa rajyasabha chunaav se sidhaa judaav nahin tha lekin yah hua usee dauraan jis vakt congress or bijepi ke donon 'manager' siten jeetne ke liye vidhayak manage karne main lage the
 All the mlas returned on the day of Rakshabandhan, 9 days later, on the day of Rakshabandhan, 44 Congress mlas came back to Gujarat on 7 August
 ahmedabad main bhi in vidhayakon ko ek resort main tehraaya gaya jahaan in logon ne raakhi kaa tyohaar bhi manaaya
 Just before the allies jolted the Congress, Congress allies NCP and JDU clarified their stand and said that their mlas will vote for BJP
 congress is faisle ke baad or satark ho gai
 Ahmad Patel Congress, who clashed till the end of voting day, still had a total of 44 mlas

 'ram Janmabhoomi Nyas constitutes the highest authority in this trust' People associated with the movement should be represented in the trust - 'mandir Vahin Banega' will be held on the first day of the eighth edition of 'agenda Aaj Tak' in the Hindi world of Kunal 'ajatak' In Ayodhya Revisited book author and IPS officer Kishore Kunal said that Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas is the highest authority in this trust
 jo log ram janmabhumi andolan se jude rahe hai un sabon kaa pratinidhitiv is trust main hona chahie
 This should be the first criterion
 uske baad architect or buddhijiviyon kaa number aata he
 Ram Janmabhoomi becomes the biggest authority of the Trust but there is a legal hurdle with it that the Act under which the land was acquired, it is written in the Act that the government can give this land only to the person whose date of formation of the Act Happened after yani janvari 1993 ke baad jis trust kaa gathan he usee ko ye jimmedaari di ja sakati he
 Therefore, the law cannot be given to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 lekin unke sadasyon ko rakhte hue ek nae trust kaa gathan hona chahie
 This is what i suggest about the formation of a trust
 doosraa suzav yah he ki humlog ramayana padhane vaale log hai
 Ramchiratmanas is the follower
 ramayana kii aatma tyaag he
 Those who are attached to it should have a feeling of sacrifice
 ram ji kii seva unki puja-archana se bhi ho sakati he
 Being a member of a trust can also happen
 isliye agar tyaag kaa bhav rakhenge to kahin koi dikkat nahin hogi
 Kishore Kunal further said that the stories of Bharata and Ram are examples of this
 donon ek duusare par satta lutaate rahe
 Such an example will not be seen in the whole world history
 shri acharya dharmendra, netaa vishwa hindu parishadram janmabhumi nyaas ek pramanik or vishwasaneey nyaas he
 This trust has done the work of generating energy inside the country for the Ram temple
 isliye nyaas ke rahete kisi or ko bhagidaar uthaane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 But you say that if the Supreme Court ordered a separate government trust, then i would say that this issue was not going to go to the Supreme Court
 sarkaar ko bahumat hi shri ram kii krupa se mili thi
 The people sitting at the top of the government used to be the first to announce - this is a tableau, kashi-mathura is left
 isliye alag se trust kii jarurat nahin thi
 If this country has got a secular constitution then it is made of Hindus
 yah mandir bina cement ke sthapaty kala ke lihaaj se ban rahaa he to ise banane main paanch saal lagenge
 Now the next agenda for people like us will be Vishwanath Kashi in Kashi and the revival of Krishna temple in Mathura
 ayodhya main bhavy mandir bane- ram vilaas vedanthiram janmabhumi nyaas ke sadsy ram vilaas vedanti ne supreme court kii ore mandir ko lekar trust banaae jane ke aadesh par kaha ki trust bananaa chahie, lekin yah trust sarkari trust ke rup main nahin hona chahie
 Ram Vilas Vedanti, a member of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, said that a trust should be formed regarding the temple, but care must be taken that it does not become a government trust
 unhone kaha ki abhi centre main bijepi kii sarkaar he to thik he
 But tomorrow, if the anti-ram government comes and they say what will happen if they build a mosque next door
 unhone kaha ki desh ke har tabake ko mandir nirmaan se jodna chahie
 Ram Vilas Vedanti said that he wanted a grand temple to be built in Ayodhya
 mandir itnaa bhavy bane ki duniyabar ke paryatak ayodhya ghoomane aaen
 This city is the land of Bhagavana Rama and should be declared as a tourist place
 haalanki trust ke gathan ko lekar vishwa hindu parishad ke acharya dharmendra ne kaha ki ram janmabhumi nyaas ek behad purana trust he
 It has played a big and important role in the movement of the temple
 iske rahete kisi or trst kii jarurat nahin thi, lekin ab jab faisla ho gaya he to isko lekar apriy vivaad nahin hona chahie
