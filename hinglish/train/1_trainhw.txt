 captain or root ne tisare wicket ke liye 186 ranon kii saajhedaari kar apni team ko jeet dilaai
 Let's look at the reasons for India's defeat - a very slow start, struggling with swing, Dhawan could not get his opening partner Rohit Sharma (2 runs in 18 balls) in this match, which was David Wiley's fourth ball of the sixth over
 He was out on the ball
 shuruyaat main rohit or dhawan donon mark wood or david viley kii swing leti gendon par sangharsh kar rahe the, jisase rangati kaaphi dhimi rahi
 With Dhawan's run out, Rhythm Tutikohli shared a 71-run partnership for the second wicket with opener Dhawan
 dhawan ko jab kohli kaa saath mila, to rangati patari par aani shuru hui
 At that time it seemed that Team India would touch the figure of 300 runs

 After Pandya, Dhoni (42) returned to the pavilion after hunting for Vile

 On the other hand, the British fielders looked completely different

 In the Kanpur Test played against New Zealand under the captaincy of Sachin Tendulkar in 1999, MSK Prasad scored 19 runs which proved to be the biggest innings of his short Test career

 i am not averse to speaking even to my mother and sister yah nae daur kaa filmi geet he, jisamen sharaab, sex or boldnes se jude gane likhe ja rahe hai, or ye hit bhi ho rahe hai
 But some people believe it to be slutty
 gayika richa sharma kahati hai, ''jis tarah ke shabdon kaa istemaal inamen ho rahaa he, usase main sahamat nahin hum
 It is not correct to pretend that people like similar songs because it is in our hands what to show and tell them
 ''kaise badla geeton kaa mizaazdesh main bindaas or bebaak yuva peedi angreji ke saath hi vibhinn kshetreey bhashaaon ke shabdon kaa sahajata ke saath istemaal kar rahi he
 Technology has changed lives
 jindagi kool ho gai or o maai god badalakar oemji ho gaya
 The films made in a year are now being ready in two to three months and song and music are being prepared in the same fashion
 pratik or upamaayen badal rahi hai
 In such a situation, rapper Honey Singh does not seem to be unconvinced that no matter how many allegations are being made on his songs that his lyrics are not good, but all his songs are inspired by ordinary life
 jo dikhataa he, vahi bikta he yaa phir 'jo bolaa ja rahaa he, use likhaa jaae' kaa aagrah pehle se zyada he
 Therefore, it is necessary to have a glimpse of this culture in literature and cinema
 vaise, 1980 ke dashak main bhi ek-do udhaaharan aise mil jate hai jab kuch gaanon se jude vivaadon ne khub jor pakadaa tha
 Such was the song Saath Sahelian from the film Vidhata (1982)
 nabbe ke dashak main isaki shuruyaat khalanaayak (1993) ke cholii ke peeche se maani ja sakati he jise aage badhaane kaa kaam govinda or david dhawan kii jodi ne kiya
 Khuddar (1994) Sexy Sexy Sexy Mujhe Bolne Bolo, Raja Babu (1994) 's Sarkai Lev Khatia and Andaaz (1994)' s Khadi Hai Khadi stands as the song was full of songs
 yah rujhaan is kadar aage badha ki yah dike bose (dely beli) or bittu sab kii le legaa (bittu bos) se hote hue ingine kii siti pe maaro bam dole (khubasurat 2014) tak pahunch gaya he
 However, one of the reasons for songwriters becoming such songs is that the sentimentality in films is also over
 geetkaar javed akhtar kehete hai, ''aaj agar koi likhnaa bhi chaahe to achche or bhaavnaatmak geeton ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 The hit and clean song composer duo Meet Brothers, like Babydoll (ragini MMS-2) and Chittian Kalaiyaan (roy), are coming out with around 40 songs this year
 ve bataate hai ki chaar-paanch gane aise hai, jinaki liriks par kuchhek logon ko aapatti ho sakati he
 He says, "the kind of public demand, and what becomes a hit, is made
" vaise bhi lirisist produsar ke mulajim kii tarah hota he, jaisaa vah chahta he vaisaa hi mujeec taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 "A part of the market and audience film industry believes that such songs are produced due to market pressure and audience demand
" audiens na sirf ise hit karaati he balki jamkar enjoy bhi karti he
 Despite the criticism of the songs of Honey Singh, he was not in terms of popularity
 gaanon ke bol utane mahatvapurn nahin, jitani ki unki aakraamak marketing
 Due to this, jaggery can also be sold in the name of chocolate
 yah geeton ko lekar hone vaali jabardast marketing hi he, jisaki vajah se ye sabaki jubaan par chadh jate hai
 Producers demand attractive lyrics for this
 misaal ke taur par produsar ekta kapur ke liye aakraamak marketing or boldnes hameshaa se hathiyaar rahe hai
 Then she will take a pinch of The Dirty Picture which you have cut or Laila Teri of Shootout at Wadala
 mjedaar baat yah he ki in gaanon ko likhane-gane vaale bhi bol ke betuke hone kii baat kar rahe hai
 Hunter 303 singer Bappi Lahiri says, "today's songs have become absurd
 '' akhtar is tarah ke geeton ko likhane se manaa karne par hi is tarah ke rujhaan main kami aane kii baat karte hai
 Richa says, "when we give good, they will listen well
" dil cheez kya he aap meri jaan lijie yaa phir bidi jalaai le jigar se piya
 
 
 There is a lot of fun in the songs

 But not vulgarity

 Producers know that there is a censor board to monitor morality or dignity
 unhen apane nivesh par munaafe kii chintaa rahati he
 And like them, the lyricist-musician also has to think about his dal-roti
 meet bros kehete hai, ''kichan chalanaa chahie
 If we do not write, the producer will get someone else done
 ''sensor board ke kade tevamb pehlaaj nihalaani kii adhyakshata vaala central board of film certification (sibiefasi) is tarah ke geeton ke liye khatra ho saktaa he
 This can be gauged from the fact that the board recently released a list of 34 words that could not be used in films
 lekin kaaphi vichaar-vimarsh ke baad is faisle ko waapas le liya gaya
 However, a member of the censor board insists that our job is to give suggestions related to the film, not to ban it
 samay ke hisaab se naitikta ke paimaane badalte rahete hai
 In such a situation, the film-makers will have to decide its limits because it has to do with the dignities as well as the steps to cool down
 piem modi kii pahal par desh main viipi culture ke khilaaf maahaul ban gaya he
 After Modi's ban on red lights on vehicles, UP CM Yogi Adityanath has also made many big decisions
 gauratlab he ki piem modi ne isi hafte VIP culture ke khilaaf bada faisla lete hue laal batti par bain kar diya
 Only people sitting in 5 constitutional posts and emergency services were exempted from this

 siem yogi ne piem modi ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue kaha tha- lalabatti hataane ke kendra sarkaar ke aitihaasik faisle kaa ham swaagat karte hai
 Every Indian is a VIP

 What decision was taken? Yogi Adityanath called a meeting on Thursday evening to see the presentation of the departments
 siem yogi ne prajentation to dekhi hi, saath hi piem modi ke faisle par amal kaa farmaan bhi jari kar diya
 CM Yogi issued an order to apply brakes on the use of red and blue lights from April 21 all over the state
 isamen kaha gaya ki koi bhi netaa, mantri yaa adhikari apni gadiyon par laal or neeli batti nahin lagayegaa

 jail main koi viipigiri nahin chalegisiem yogi ne jail main chal rahe viipigiri par bhi tagdi chot kii he
 Yogi Adityanath has instructed the authorities to provide the same food and other facilities to all mafia don and general criminals lodged in jails across the state
 siem ne kaha ki pichhali sarkaron main aksar aisa sunne ko miltaa rahaa he ki mafia don jail main band rahakar bhi sukh-suvidhapurna jivan bitaa rahe hai or phone kaa bedadak istemaal kar rahe hai
 Now this will not do

 philhal content kii vajah se 'veere di wedding' kii khub charchaa ho rahi he
 Well its story is headless
 kuch aise ki 'gam main duubo to thailand chale jaao
 Get drunk if you have a breakup
 asal jindagi main aisa hona bahut aam nahin he
 'the film is getting a lot of criticism because of the content
 tamaam darshakon ko film kaa content pach nahin rahaa he
 Especially the lifestyle of female leads shown in the film
 haalanki kai myanon main film kharaab bhale ho, lekin tamaam aisi chijen bhi hai jisaki vajah se ise tavajjo diya janaa chahie
 This film makes women different from their own world and lifestyle
 ye duniya he jarur par kuch-kuch sikret
 Let's know why Veere should notice
 # 1
 Like the rest of Bollywood films, Mel EGO has a tremendous thngavire of girls, the wedding has the spice of romance, mingling and then crying
 lekin iske said effect nahin hai
 Because there is no breakup pain for girls seen in a closed room, shedding tears or appearing in a 'no makeup look'
 balki pehle se bhi zyada glam luk main holiday enjoy karte hue chizon ko peeche chhod dena he
 This cool attitude of girls shocks 'mel Ego'
 is par aapatti kyon? kya garlfriend se brallep ke baad doston sang sharaab party karne kaa copirite to sirf ladakon ke paas hi he
 Veere Di Wedding, Raji earned 4 times more than budget # 2, close to 50 crores # 2
 cultural shock yaa nae trend ko dekhne kii aadat nahinbollywood main ab tak jitna purushon ke 'sexual dijair' par khulkar baat hui he, utani kabhi femail kirdaaron ko sexuali active nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 Till now, only boys have been seen doing adult comedy in films
 veere di wedding main mukhya dhara kii hindi cinema se alag, mahilaon kaa aisa rang-dhang shaayad pehali baar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 While it is not that these characters or people are not seen in real life
 is film ko dekhte-dekhte zyaadaatar ladakiyon ko apane friend grups kii tamaam kahaniyaan yaad aa hi jaaengi, jo 'veere di wedding' ke tamaam kirdaaron se milti-julati hai
 The use of abuses in the film is certainly strange
 ye ek tarah kaa cultural shock bhi detaa he
 But isn't this really happening? If the abuses come out of the hero's mouth, there are applause in the theater, but in the cinema, when such abuses come out of the tongue of a heroin, people start sniffing
 kyon bhai? pichley 18 saalon main duniya bahut badal gai he
 Now don't look at the girls in the fixed slot
 veere di wedding main beti ke bold seen par swara bhaskar kii maa ne kya kaha? padhein # 3
 What to do with this bag at weddings? The basic issue is that of a girl of her choice in weddings
 saal nahin gin paaenge tab se ye dikkat he
 It is said- 'marriages occur by joining two hearts
 ' par, nahin- 'hamaare yahaan kii shaadiyon main do dilon kaa rishta kam, par rishtedaaron ke dil zyada jude hote hai
 'veere Di Wedding again reminded me of this
 ladki ko sasuraal kii har aadat ko achche se siikhnaa paaramparik shaadiyon kii sabase badi demand he
 But what to do with girls like Kalindi (kareena Kapoor's character)? Those who believe - "whatever you do, you should deal with them
" " aisi soch vaali ladakiyon kii shaadi aasaani se hoti bhi to nahin
 Veere Di Wedding's wedding to Kalindi halted
 ye to acha tha ki use samajhane vaala life partner he varanaa kalindi kii shaadi mushkil thi
 By the way, this film is a story
 bhala asal jindagi main kisi kalindi ko koi ladkaa itnaa bhav kahaan detaa he? # 4
 And why the girls will like this film, The Wedding is earning fiercely at the box office
 tamaam kamiyon ke baavjood veere di wedding main kuch aisa he jo nai peedi khaastaur se ladakiyon / mahilaon ko pasand aa rahi he
 Mostly girls up to the age of 30–35 years
 darasal, wo is film ke tamaam kirdaaron se khud ko judaa mahasoos kar rahi hai
 You may criticize the film in a male-dominated thinking process, but most girls agree with the reality of 'veere Di Wedding'
 swara ke bold seen par tamaam bahes ke liye spes jarur hona chahie, lekin yah bhi mat bhuuliye ki mahilaon main pyaar, krodh, mamata, dayaa jaise imoshans ke alaava ek or imoshan he- 'sexual dijair

 But these days, a similar situation has happened to Hafiz Saeed, a Pakistani terrorist who painted his hand with the blood of thousands of innocents
 kal tak jo haafiz said hindustan ko sabak sikhaane ke dam bharaa karata tha, ab indian army kii jambaaji dekhakar wo qatlo-gaarat ke raste hi galat tehraane main laga he
 In fact, this year alone, more than two hundred and fifty terrorists have been put to death in the Indian Army Army, so in the new video released by Hafiz Saeed, he is listening to the guilt
 aatankihafiz saidakah rahaa he "main aaj apane azim kashmiri bhaaiyon kii is kadra azim qurbaani par aaj unako tahseem pesh karata hum
 i want to say to the Indian Army Chief that when he has been shooting bullets
 sidhi goliyaan maarna
 
 mardon auraton ko is tarah katl karnaa kya yahi rastaa he
 They are killing more than a dozen slaughtered and twins
 ye goliyaan katl isse duniya main masale hal nahin hote
 i request wazir-e-azam not to leave this issue
 "ye hafiz ko kya ho gaya
 It seems that all is not well in Pakistan
 varanaa apni gidad bhabhakiyon ke liye mashhoor hafiz said ke bayanon main ye bebasii main nazar naa aati
 Operation All Out in the Valley is impacting Hafiz Saeed and his operatives in exactly the same way
 jaisaa ghar main machhar bhagane vaali mashin lagane ke baad machharon kaa hota he
 India's enemy Hafiz Saeed is saying "I ask with the Army Chief who is going to do the last operation
" sidhi goliyaan maarna
 Is this the way to kill men and women in this way? ye masil ke hal karne kaa
 Trying to become Asia's biggest champion
 main us hind sarkaar or army chif se poochna chahta hum
 If you have increased, what will be your result? ek hi rastaa he
 Give Kashmir independence
 "darasal, ye hamaare javaanon ko halke main le rahe the
 But what did the army show a little eye? ye to ghutanon par hi aa gaye
 And started teaching humanity lessons
 magar janaab insaaniyat kaa sabak lene yaa dene kii pehali shart
 To be a human being

 Now the situation is that there is a shortage of staff in all the terrorist organizations of Kashmir
 or is kami ko puraa karne ke liye kashmir ke naujavaanon kaa apharan kiya ja rahaa he taaki unhen bargala kar aatanki banaaya ja sake
 Those who kill the people of their own valley
 magar oparation ol out ne to hafiz ke tamaam plan kii dhajjiyaan uda rakhi hai
 And those who turned the opposite valley red with the blood of innocents are now teaching peace lessons
 sena ke oparation ne hafiz ke tamaam manasuubon par naa sirf pani pher diya he balki use ye ehsaas bhi kara diya he ki bhartiya javaanon kaa ye phul ection tab tak jari rahegaa jab tak ghati ke aatankiyon ko jananath tak pahunchaa nahin diya jaataa he
 The year is not over yet and the army has so far killed 251 terrorists
 ginati abhi bhi jari rahegi
 And this countdown will continue until the valley is cleared of terrorists
 sena ne bhi kasam kha rakhi he ki jab tak pakistan kashmir ke patharbaajon ko deshadroh kii ghutti pilaanaa band nahin kar detaa
 Till then this operation is not going to stop
 lihaaza tab tak hafiz ke in video shok sandeshon kii aadat daal lijie
 In my video message, Hafiz Saeed is saying "I present my Tehsim today on this Azim Qurbani of my Azim Kashmiri brothers and i say with confidence that the days of Inshallah Kashmir independence are near
 allaah taala shohadaaon kii qurbaani ata farmaae
 Take care soon but i want to request that you have arranged a large way
 jis sataha kii qurbaani de di he
 There is nothing of freedom
 insha allaah bahut jald kashmir ke logon ko ek shandaar aazaadee is sadi kaa sabase bada vakya hoga
 "hafiz Saeed's sorrow can be understood
 kyon ki pichley do saalon se
 
 jab se oparation ol out shuru hua he
 Since then, terrorists have come to India from across the border, but are not able to return
 ab tak hafiz ke saikadon gurgey bina kuch kiye hi qurbaan ho chuke hai
 And not a single plan of terror has been allowed to be completed by the Indian Army

 Especially the company is getting a lot of setback in the US

 Huawei has already been banned in the US, but now Google has canceled Android license from Huawei
 news agency royatres ne ise report kiya or baad main ise conform bhi kiya gaya he
 Huawei's new smartphones will also not have access to Google apps and services
 mumkin he huaave ke smartfones main google maps, utyub, google play store or duusare jaruri google ke eps kaa bhi acces band kar diya jayega
 This could have a major impact on the company's customers, including Huawei
 haalanki google ne huaave ke liye android kaa license khud se cancil nahin kiya he, balki google america commers department ke aadesh kaa paalan kar rahi he
 a Google spokesperson said in a statement, 'we are following the order and reviewing it
 google play protect or security protection huaave ke maujuuda smartfones main die jate rahenge’maujuuda huaave ke smartfones main google ke is faisle kaa koi khaas fark nahin padegaa, lekin sthiti aisi hi bani rahi to nishchit taur par huaave smartfones yugers kii mushkil badhengi
 After Google's decision, Huawei will no longer be able to use Android Open Source Project
 iskaa matlab ye he ki google ke eps or sarvice huaave ke phone main aane vaale samay main nahin die jaaenge
 Significantly, pressure has been put on Huawei by the US President Donald Trump government
 isaki vajah ye he ki america ko is baat kaa dar he ki chini sarkaar america network kii jasusi karne ke liye huaave kii madad le rahi he
 The battle between America and Huawei is not new
 pichley saal america intelligence agenciyon ne huaave or ZTE ke divaais yuj karne ko lekar agaah kiya tha or america politicians ne huaave ko ek chini sarkaar kaa ek ang qaraar diya he
 Huawei says that it is not possible for the Chinese government to put something in their device for espionage
 company ne ummid jataai he ki bhavishya main bijness thi ho jayega
 Overall, for now, this is so much that it remains difficult for crores of Huawei smartphone users
 kyonki abhi bhi yah saaf nahin hua he ki yugers par iskaa asar kya padegaa
 Not only this, in the coming time, in the smartphones that Huawei will sell, the company will give its software or the company will not launch the phone until the license is corrected with Android
 aapako bataa den ki huaave apane oparating system par bhi kaam kar rahi he
 But given the popularity of Android, it is difficult to say what the future of Huawei smartphones will be without Android

 kyonki ab yahi tarika rah gaya, jisase maamla kuch sulajh jaae varanaa to jab court main sunwaayee kii taarikh aegi tabhi court koi faisla le saktaa he, varanaa jaisaa chal rahaa he chalata rahegaa

 Because now this is the way, so that the matter is resolved otherwise the court can take a decision only when the date of hearing in the court comes, otherwise it will go on as it goes

 kuch aisa hi is baar bhi hota dikhaa
 Kejriwal looked more trapped in the party's confusion than the government
 par kuch muddon par sarkaar kii bhi fajihat hui
 The posters in Delhi, April Fool i
e
 Kejriwal Day, look at five such controversies
 
 
 1
 This party emerged from the womb of the Lokpal movement, whose broom destroyed the expectations of the BJP Congress in Delhi
 lekin 49 din main hi ye party apane lokapal kii aalochana bhi bardaasht nahin kar pai
 What Admiral Ramdas, the first Lokpal of the party, said that there is no democracy in the party, he was removed from the post of Lokpal without informing him
 2
 When Aam Aadmi Party created a ruckus about Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, party convenor Arvind Kejriwal kept silence
 unhen party kii sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha piesi se hataa diya gaya
 The illness of the party increased and Kejriwal went to Bangalore for his treatment
 phir rashtriya parishad kii baithak main dilli ke chunaav main gaddari ke naam par prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ko rashtriya kaaryakarini se hataane kaa faisla kar liya gaya
 3
 aise hi professor anand kumaar, mayank gandhi, aatishi marlena ko pravaktaa pad se hataa diya gaya
 Rakesh Sinha and Ajit Jha were discharged from the party's national executive
 yani kejariwal ke yas main party main bane rahenge par unki mukhaalafat karne vaale haashie par chale gaye
 4
 kejarivalki raajnneeti kii ek buniyaad to sting hi he
 But the King of Sting is now himself a victim
 aap ke purv vidhayak rajesh garg ne kejariwal se baatcheet kaa ek sting jagajaahir kiya, jisamen loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kejariwal congress vidhayakon ke saath dilli main sarkaar banane kii jodtod chaah rahe hai
 After this, another sting of Kejriwal appeared in which he was seen to be breaking the modesty of decency
 kejariwal ne saaf kar diya ki party main vahi rahenge, jinhen wo chahenge or jinhen nahin chahenge
 To put forth his point, he also resorted to some abusive words, which exposed his humility
 to dilli chhod denge kejariwal!5
 The garbage spread on the streets of Delhi from the bjp-ruled MCD became a question on the image of the Aam Aadmi Party and the government's Iqbal
 ab sawaal yah bhi bana hua he ki haryana ne pani nahin diya to viviipi kaa pani katkar dilli kii janata ko kaise raahat denge kejariwal
 Shri Narendra Modi is roaming in UP saying that UP has made him the PM of the country, which is right, but why did he promise and betray the 22 crore people of UP? If UP can make him PM, then he can also remove him from the post for which complete preparation is visible
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa, khaskar modi ko janata kii yah baat samajni chahie ki agar vah unhen pradhanmantri bana sakati he to unhen us pad se hataa bhi sakati he, jisaki puri-puri taiyaari is loksabhaa chunaav main dikhaai de rahi he
 Mayawati said that Modi declared his caste as backward for political and electoral interests, but BSP-SP-RLD listened to the mind of 22 crore people of the state, understood it and respected it with full public interest and national interest
 The alliance formed in the wake of this

 ’’ Former Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, LK Advani's former assistant Sudheendra Kulkarni, two BJP mps and two others were discharged by a Delhi court in the 2008 vote-for-money note case
 haalanki court ne amar singh ke purv sahaayak sanjeev saxena ke khilaaf aarope taiyaar karne kaa aadesh diya he
 Special Judge Narottam Kaushal acquitted Amar Singh and Kulkarni, BJP mps - Ashok Argal and Fagan Singh Kulaste, former BJP MP Mahabir Singh Bhagora and BJP worker Suhel Hindustani - in the cash-for-note note case
 in sabhi par bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon kii vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 The court, however, asked for framing of charges against Amar Singh's former assistant Sanjeev Saxena
 sanjeev par kathith rup se bhrashtachar ko badhaava dene kaa aparaadh karne kaa aarope he
 Delhi Police, in its first charge sheet filed in August 2011, conspired to plot a 'note for vote' scandal to bribe some mps before the trust vote to be presented to Amar Singh and Kulkarni in Lok Sabha on July 22, 2008
 Was charged
 amar singh ke bare main adaalat ne kaha ki unke khilaaf paristhitijanya saboot andeh se aage nahin jate hai
 Regarding the role of Kulkarni, the court said that his role was only to bring Argal, Kulaste and the fugitive to the TV channels so that the evidence related to the defection was recorded
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki aage ke ghatnakram main kulkarni kii koi bhoomika nahin thi or galat raaston se avaidh kaam karne ke vichaar se koi baithak nahin kii gai or is sambandh main koi pratyaksh saboot nahin hai
 The court also said that the purpose of meeting the TV channel party was only to reveal the defection in Parliament
 bijepi netaa argal, kulaste or bhagoda ke bare main adaalat ne kaha ki tivi channel ko aamantrit karne or camera ke saamne hajir hone ko yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki ve avaidh gatividhiyon main shaamil the
 The court also rejected the prosecution's plea that the act of exposing the party in Parliament was only a drama

 ? Now comment below and tell us, did you also come to know the reality only after telling us, or did you yourself guess the correct answer
 
 
 ab neeche coment kar sirf itnaa bataaie, kya aapako bhi hamaare bataane ke baad hi asaliyat kaa pataa chalaa, yaa aapane khud hi sahi jawaab kaa andaaza laga liya tha
 
 
 Nowadays point and shoot cameras have been replaced by smartphones
 jahaan ek taraf smartfones ke camere teen-chaar hote ja rahe hai to duusari taraf unamem DSLR banane kii hode bhi lagi he
 All the features are being given in smartphones camera from blurred background to low-light photography
 haalanki ye kitni kaamyaab ye ek alag vishay he
 Meanwhile, compact cameras are also being updated when people are looking for better cameras in smartphones or are thinking of getting a DSLR directly
 ek feechar aisa bhi he jisamen abhi smartfones ke camere bahut peeche hai wo he behatar optical juum kaa feechar
 One such compact camera powershot SX740 HS was recently launched by Canon
 hamane iskaa upyog kiya he or ab iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 The company has priced this camera at 27,995
 isane canan ke portpholio main pichley saal relies kiye powershot SX730 HS ko riples kiya he
 Design, specifications and features: First of all, let us know that this is a travel camera
 isaki sabase badi khubi iskaa 40X optical juum he
 Apart from this optical zoom, you will also get Canon's zoomplus feature which will give you 80x digital zoom
 haalanki isamen aapako image quality se samjhauta karnaa padegaa
 20 in addition to 40x optic zoom (equivalent to 24-960mm) in SX740 HS
 3MP 1 / 2
 3-type (6
 17 x 4
 55 mm) back-illuminated CMOS sensor is provided
 in spacifications ke avava jo feechar is camere ko or bhi khaas banaata he wo he 4K ultra HD video shoot karne kaa feechar
 Here you also have a 4K timelaps mode
 saath hi isamen five-exis image stabiligeshan or canan kaa letest Digic 8 procesar bhi milegaa jo aapako fast autofocus jaise kaam main madad karegaa
 Its ISO sensitivity range is 80 to 3200
 haalanki auto mod main aapako keval ISO 1600 main hi santosh karnaa padegaa
 Talking about the design, since it is a compact camera, it is quite easy to hold and hold it together
 isliye ye street photography ke liye behtareen opshan he, jahaan aapako telephoto kii suvidha bhi milegi
 There is also an option of wi-fi and Bluetooth for sharing from smartphones
 connactivity ke liye HDMI or micro USB port maujuud he
 In such a situation, you can easily charge it like a smartphone with a type-b charger
 iskaa overol luk simple rakhaa gaya he, jahaan aapako dheron shooting mod milenge
 However, you can give more importance to manual mode for doing photography as you wish
 ek pareshaani ye he ki isamen aapako RAW main photose clic karne kaa opshan nahin milegaa
 Here is a separate button for the video
 isi tarah wi-fi on karne ke liye bhi batan ko alag se jagah di gai he
 3 in its back
 0-inch kii screen di gai he jise 180 degree tak ghumaya ja saktaa he
 That is, you can use it to take a selfie and after this you will be able to take a good wide selfie after being completely zoomed out
 haalanki screen kii ek buraai ye he ki ye tach screen nahin he
 Which may be a bit bad for 2018, but the other side of it is that if there was a touch screen, then its price would have increased
 parformens or image quality:isaki parformens kii baat karen to ye kaaphi quick he
 Quickly detects the subject and autofocus
 lekin ye baat lagu hogi wide angel shot lete samay wo bhi din main
 That is, when you zoom out completely and click photos, then you will be easy to lock focus
 Digic 8 procesar kii vajah se ye barst shot yaa continus shot bahut shandaar parform karata he
 Also, the performance of the video is also excellent
 videos main aapako autofocus kaaphi fast milegi
 But as soon as you go to the maximum zoom, you will start having problems with autofocus
 sabase kharaab baat yahaan ye he ki aise samay main aap kisi ek focus ko select bhi nahin kar sakate
 You will have to resort to Face and Tracking, Tracking AF or Center Point
 isaki vajah se kabhi-kabhi aap ek acha shot miss kar sakate hai
 Usually we tap on the screen in smartphones to lock focus
 yahaan screen bhi tach nahin he or autofocus juum main saath hi nahin detaa, aise main bahut dikkat hoti he
 The situation gets worse when you start zooming in low-light condition
 yahaan aapako baar-baar shot ricompoj karne kii jarurat hogi
 That is, you cannot select the focal point you want
 jahaan tak image quality kii baat he to din ke samay yaa phul-lite condishan main photo quality behtareen milegi vahiin lo-lite condishan main aapako photose main sharpaness or detail kam milegi
 And in very dark conditions you can be very disappointed with the photo quality
 din kii liting main bhi aap jab phul 40x optical juum main photose clic karenge to aapako image kii diteling thodi miss hoti hui lagegi
 During high zoom, try to have a tripod or else the photo may be too much shake
 haalanki isamen isus bachane ke liye image stabiligeshan diya gaya he, iske baavjood aapako saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat hogi
 One good thing is that with the tripod you can get a good picture in low-light by reducing the shutter speed and increasing the aperture
 lekin shater zyada slo karne par mowing object clic nahin ho sakenge keval building jaisi bahut acchhee lagengi
 However, it is a fact that very few people would like to use the Trypod with Point and Shoot
 kyonki phir use bhi kairi karnaa hoga
 As far as the color quality in the image is concerned, it is much better
 photo sample:image ko kisi bhi tarah se edit nahin kiya gaya he
 They are resized for the web only
 faisla:ab sawaal ye he ki kya aapako ye camera lenaa chahie? to jawaab ye he ki yadi aap travel yaa holiday yaa street photography / videography ke liye ek behtareen juum vaala compact camera chaahate hai to isamen paise laga sakate hai
 The ability to shoot 4K video at 30fps is also a great feature
 jo kamiyaan aapako dhyaan rakhni hai wo ye hai ki lo-lite yaa juum condishan main autofocus aapako pareshaan kar saktaa he
 There will be no option to shoot in RAW and touchscreen is not available
 in sabake alaava chote sensor kii vajah se lo-lite parformens bhi thodi thik nahin he
 In such a situation, if you want to focus more on image quality except zoom, then in low-light condition, then you can try other compact cameras in the market

 On 1 February, Googles celebrated the date of the release of Kamaladas' biography 'my Story' book by making a doodle
 yah kitaab 1 farvari 1975 ko relies hui thi
 Actually, the film is based on the life of female poetess and writer Kamaladas of Kerala
 dakshin bharat kii naiyar parivaar main janmin kamaladas ne 65 saal kii umr main islam kubul kar liya tha
 The reason for this was his disillusionment with idol worship
 unki shaadi 15 saal kii umr main brahman parivaar main hui thi
 At that time he was fiercely opposed by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 unhen dhamkiyaan bhi milin thim
 Kamalada had to take police protection because of this protest
 1999 main kamaladas ne hindu dharm ko chhodkar islam kubul kiya tha
 At the time she said 'she does not want her body to be burnt
 ve chaahati hai marane ke baad unhen dafnaaya jaae
 'he said in an interview' Islam is a religion of love, Hindus have always hurt me
 hindu dharm ke kattar samarthako ne hameshaa meraa apmaan kiya he
 i want love ’islam kubul karne ke thik baad kamaladas jab landan gayi to vahaan par bhi unhone islam ke bare main apni behad sakaaratmak raay rakhi
 He said in an interview, "I want to make Islam the religion of the new millennium
" main logon ko is dharm ke gunon ke bare main bataaungi, us khushi ko saajha karuungi jo mujhe ismaal ko apnaane ke baad mili
 i have no words to describe the experiences of Islam
 main pyaar ke ehsaas se sarabor or khud ko surakshit mahasoos karti hum
 Good Muslims help others
 ’’malayalam akhbaar ‘janmabhumi’ main kamaladas ko lekar likhe gaye ek artical main daawa kiya gaya tha ki islam kubul karne ke baad jab unhen apni galati kaa ehsaas hua to vah dobaaraa hindu dharm apnaanaa chaahati thim, magar unke bade bete ne unhen salaah di ki agar ve aisa karengi to muslim kattarpanthi unki hatya kar denge
 However, in Kerala, this newspaper is called the mouthpiece of right-wingers
 aurat hone kaa dard saaf jhalkata tha
 
 kamaladas kii lekhnee main aurat hone kaa dard saaf jhalkata tha
 This pain was also reflected in his autobiography 'my Story' and also in many of his poems
 yah dard gaahe-bagaahe saarvajanik taur par bhi jhalka
 He had also spoken of being born in 'wrong gender' in an interview
 unka kahana tha ki auraton ko lekhika banane ke liye tab tak intjaar karnaa padataa he jab tak unke bal safed na ho jaaen
 He first has to play the role of a good wife, mother, etc
 angreji upanyaas vans on room kii lekhika virginia woolf kii tarah hi kamaladas ne kaha tha ‘auraton ke paas lekhan ke liye apni ek teble bhi nahin hoti he

 prakaash singh ne farvari maheene main haryana main hue jat andolan kii jo report taiyaar kii thi usne haryana ke puri sarkari system kii khaamiyon ko desh ke saamne laakar rakh diya tha
 Due to the same report, the Haryana government had to take action against many officers in a hurry and the government was also troubled
 haryana sarkaar ne report taiyaar karne se kiya inkaarshayad ab isi dar kii vajah se haryana menjat andolanke dauraan hui hinsa par report kaa doosraa bhaag taiyaar karne se haryana sarkaar ne inkaar kar diya he

 Prakash Singh said that he had met the Chief Minister of Haryana some time ago and when he spoke to the Chief Minister about another report, he said that i should wait for a few days
 lekin kuch din baadagrih mantralyaki ore se patr mila or kaha gaya ki duusari report kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Singh says that the government has not given any reason behind the closure of the report

 The Government has written a formal letter thanking me for the fact that i have done commendable work in the first report
 saath hi patr main yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki ab jat andolan ke dauraan hui hinsa par duusari report kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Politics is going on, the session of Haryana Vidhan Sabha is going on and in such a situation politics has also started on this issue

 The Congress accused the Haryana government, while the Congress targeted the Haryana government, saying that on the first report of the Prakash Singh Commission, the government has not taken any action on any big officer and only smiled
 isi vajah se sarkaar prakaash singh kii duusari report ko bhi dabaane main lagi he or agar sarkaar ko ye report leni nahin thi to banavaai kyon thi
 The government is avoiding the fear of trouble! Even after the first report of Prakash Singh Commission came, the government was very troubled and the BJP government of Haryana had to face heavy political attacks

 One thing you will agree that now Android and ios are becoming boring in many ways and the hardcore users of smartphones need a better OS
 lekin nokia 2017 main jab nokia phir se bazaar main vaapasi kar rahi hogi to jaahir he yugers ko usamen android ke alaava kuch behatar kii ummid hogi
 But what will they get? Nokia smartphone running on Android operating system which will have Snapdragon processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB memory and possibly 16 megapixel rear camera
 aap rojaanaa aisi khabaren sunate honge jinamein aise hi spacification or fitures vaale smartphone launch hote rahete hai
 So will Nokia be able to establish a reign again because people's memories are attached to it? i do not think so at all
 in vajahon se phir se flop ho sakati he nokia!nokia ke phir se flop hone ke kai kaaran hai
 Take Blackberry as an example
 jab blueberi apane khaas oparating system vaale smartphone launch karti thi or flop hone lagi to use laga ki android laane se phir se khoi hui chhavi waapas paa lenge
 But what happened? The company has so far launched three Android smartphones
 wo bhi aise smartphone jisaki security duniya ke kisi bhi android smartphone se behatar thim
 Apart from this, features like Blackberry Hub which used to be hardcore fans, Blackbury did not benefit from all this
 blueberi se leni hogi nokia ko seekhblakeberi ke hashr se aap sab waakif honge
 Alam is that the company has closed its mobile business forever
 haalanki duusari companiyon se smartphone banavaayegi
 The name is the same but are the same experts still present? Now come back to Nokia
 jo nokia ki khaasiyat thi ab wo nahin rahi
 Nokia has been sold to HMD Global
 jin best diziners or ejiniers ke badaulat nokia ne nae aayam ko chuaa tha wo microsoft main ja chuke hai yaa unhone apana starop shuru kar liya he
 Tech experts of The Verge have said that it can be said that the name of Nokia is the same name, but now perhaps efficiency is not what it was before
however, it is not that Nokia does not know the market
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki company ne vada kiya he ki quality ke standard hai honge jabaki dizin or ejineering ke maamle main dusron se bahetar honge
 But this is no different that it can give the tag of clear winner
 nokia ne duniya bhar main set kiya he ek alag standard2012 main nokia ne Lumia 920 ko is daawey ke saath launch kiya tha ki ye duniya sabase advanced smartphone he
 It had a touch screen that could also be used with gloves
 iske alaava isaki body policarbonate kii thi or aakraamak colors bhi die gaye the
 For photography, it was given a pure view camera with optical image stabilization
 yah smartphone windos oparating system par chalaaya gaya
 In a time when companies used to give less optical image stabilization in cameras
 isi tarah or bhi spacification sabase alag the, lekin phir bhi aapako pataa he ki nokia kaa hashr kya hua
 Now, with the introduction of Android, will Nokia again become the old Nokia? Apple and Samsung will have a dent in market share! In the current era, Apple and Samsung are two companies that are launching smartphones with better specification and design around the world
 dhyaan den kii ham motorola, shaomi, lenovo or van plus kii baat nahin kar rahe hai, kyonki ye bhi kisi se kam nahin hai
 Still, if Nokia has to come back with Android, it will have to break into the market share of Apple and Samsung
 or yah is daur main kaaphi mushkil najar aata he
 It is also possible that Nokia will make a comeback after making a comeback with Android, but will be called second-rate smartphone
 jo na to nokia ke liye behatar hoga or na hamaare liye
 Because there is a relationship with Nokia
 ham us nokia ko jaanate hai jisane n Series se lekar 6600 jaise anokhe phone laae jo dizin se lekar feechar tak main number-1 the
 People are not just different from the number-1 handset, hopeful people are also expecting the same case to be number-1 again
 phir se nokia aise phone laae jo dusron se dizin, feechar or quality ke maamalon alag hi nahin balki number-1 bhi hon
 And to live up to the expectations of people, i do not think that just by bringing Android, Nokia's work will be easy
 iske liye agal dizin or aisi quality lani hogi jo logon ne pehle experience nahin kiya ho
 However, we expect Nokia to give a tough competition to Apple and Samsung to launch a smartphone that will be fun to review
 in dinon ek hi tarah ke smartphone ke bare main likh or rivyuu karke bor ho rahaa hum shaayad

 17 april ko popular chini ap Tik Tok bharat main google play store or aipal ap store se hataa liya gaya
 The reason was that the Madras High Court had decided to ban it
 3 april ko tamilnadu kii ek court ne sarkaar se Tik Tok ap bain karne ko kaha tha
 The court was to say that Tik Tok promotes pornography
 court ye faisla ek PIL ke baad aayaa jisamen ek shaks ne Tik Tok bain karne ke liye PIL file kii thi
 According to an IT ministry official, after the Madras High Court order, the government wrote letters to Google and Apple asking them to remove the Tik Tok app from their platform
 aakhirkaar google ne 18 april ko Tik Tok ap par bain lagaaya or apane store se hataa liya yani downlod par roak lag gai
 After the ban was lifted, Tik Toc's statement Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has decided to remove the ban from Tik Tok
 Tik Tok bayaan aa chukaa he
 Tik Tok has said, 'we are happy with this decision and we are confident that this decision will also be welcomed by the tick talk community
 ham hamaare yugers ko behatar tareeke se sarv kiye jane ke liye die gaye is maukey ke liye abhaari hai
 We will prevent our platform from being misused, and the work does not end here

 Although the download was banned, but still those who had the Tick Talk app were using it
 ise company kaa nuksaan bhi hua he or report ke mutabik is bain se har din company ko 5 lakh dollar kaa nuksaan ho rahaa tha
 This is certainly a big relief for the company
 lekin ab puri ummid he ki company apni policy main kuch badlaav karegi, taaki bhavishya main aisa na ho
 Why remove Tik Tok from Bain? Amicus Curiane from Tik Tok was what you might call Nyamitra or in simple words Tic Tock's Counsel Senior Advocate Arvind Datar
 daatar ne apane statment main kaha he ki aisi koi bhi vyavastha nahin ho sakati he jo vaidhanik rup se maanya ho, lakin nyaayik rup se purna na ho
 Banning this app is not a solution
 yugers kii rhite suraksha karnaa jaruri he
 The court has made it clear that the court is only concerned about the protection of online users, especially children against whom there are cybercrime
 daatar ne ye iti act ke section 79 kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki jaise fasebuk ko iske plateform par kisi shaks dwaara apadet kiye gaye avaidh states yaa kisi avaidh massej ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he, thik isi tarah se Tik Tok ko us par aplod kiye gaye contant ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has remarked that India does not have a Legislation like COPAA (children's Online Privacy Protection) to protect children in cyberspace
 america main 13 saal tak ke bacchon kii privesi ke liye COPAA he jise vahaan 2000 main lagu kiya gaya tha
 On behalf of Tik Tok, Senior Advocate Isaac Mohanlan has told the court that Tik Tok has technology that can ensure that nude or observant contents are not uploaded on this app
 iske alaava tik tok ne is tarah ke contant ko rokane ke liye uthaae gaye kadam ke bare main bhi court ko bataaya he

 iskaa andaja aapako ghadkauli gaanv main pair rakhte hi chalegaa, jahaan gaanv ke baahar laga sin board kahata he- 'da great chamaar doctor bhimrao ambedkar gram ghadkauli aapkaa swaagat karata he
 The use of the word 'chamar' for Dalits is considered a caste crime and as per the Penal Code of India you can be punished for using this word, but the Dalits of Ghadkauli village do not object to this word but feel proud 
 apni pahchaan or apni jati par is gaanv ke dalit sharminda nahin he
 Munish, who hails from the same village, says that when farming is also done by the Dalits in the village, all the work is done by the Dalits, then why should he be ashamed in the name of his name and his caste
 ek hajaar se zyada aabaadi vaale ghadkauli gaanv main 800 se zyada dalit parivaar rahete hai daliton kii ekajutata kaa nateeja hi he ki gaanv waalon ne is gaanv ko 'da great chamaar' naam de diya, lekin is naam ke liye unhen ek badi keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 Due to this name, this village has also seen ethnic conflicts in the year 2016, but even after the struggle, the village stands and is proudly showing its identity to the world
 daliton ko insaaf dilaane ke liye banaai armysirf ye gaanv hi khaas nahin he, khaas he is gaanv kii hifaazat karne vaali wo fouj jo ambedkar ke vichaaron ko lekar daliton ke saamaajik insaaf ke liye bani or aaj bhi is ek gaanv se nikalakar aasapaas ke ilaakon main bhi daliton ke haq kii ladaai lard rahi he
 The army formed in this village is Bhima Army
 gaanv ke zyaadaatar ladke is 'bhim army' kaa hissaa he
 Although the Bhim Army has said its job is to bring social justice to the Dalits and it believes in the constitution of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, but some controversies have been associated with it
 daaman par ghadkauli cond kaa daag23 saal ke tinku buddha disergent powder kaa vyapaar karte hai or ghadkauli gaanv main bhim army ke gram pramukh hai
 Tinku became part of the Bhima Army in February 2016 to fight the Dalits
 april 2016 main is gaanv main kaaphi bavaal hua tha, jab do jatiyon ke bich gaanv ke isi board par vivaad uth gaya
 The case reached the ethnic group, after which lathi charge was also carried out by the police
 us ghatana ke baad is gaanv ke dalit ekajute ho gaye or tabhi se bhim army ke sadasyon kii sankhya main kaaphi ijapha hua
 Today, there are more than 700 members of the Bhima Army in this village and they claim that they are fighting for the social rights of Dalits
 ghadkauli cond aaj bhi gaanv vaale bhul nahin pate
 It is alleged that people belonging to other castes first painted this board named after the village with black ink and then also inked the grandson of Ambedkar's statue in the village
 gaanv waalon kaa aarope he ki yah sab dabangon dwaara kiya gaya or shikaayat par police ne bhi gaanv waalon kii nahin suni
 The situation improves and the board of 'the Great Chamar Village' welcomes every visitor
 bhim army daliton kii ekajutata kaa cheharaa ban gai jiske baad purush hi nahin gaanv kii mahilaon ko bhi ab suraksha ko lekar kisi tarah kaa dar nahin he
 The Bhima Army claims to go to any extent for its community
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya is gaanv kii fouj kanoon bhi todatii ? 23 saal ke ashvini dalit hai or peshey se plumber he
 Last year, he joined the Bhima Army and claims that he took this step to ensure equality and justice for the Dalits
 is bhim army kaa puraa naam he-'bhim army bharat ekta mishan' jiskaa gathan kiya tha edwocket chandrashekhar aaazaad ne
 This Bhima Army was formed in July 2015, but after the ethnic violence in this village in April 2016, the Bhima Army made headlines for the first time
 edwocketchandrashekhar ajaadpaas ke hi gaanv ke rahvaasee hai or daliton ke liye ladaai ladane kaa daawa karne vaale chandrashekhar kii bhim army se aasapaas ke kai dalit yuva jud gaye hai
 Chandrasekhar also claims that the Bhima Army aims to protect the Dalits and get their rights, but for this he also claims to try every method which is also against the law of the country

 khan ke vakil ne kaha ki yah dikhaane ke liye koi saboot nahin he ki salmaan car chalaa rahe the
 It has been revealed in the cross-examination of the witnesses that Salman got down from the right side of the car as the left door of the car got blocked due to the accident and not open
 shivade ne bataaya ki car ke agle hisse main baayin taraf baithe hue vyakti ke liye darwaja jam hone par daahine taraf se utarana hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 So, Salman did this

 For Rahul Gandhi, the Gujarat election will be very memorable in two ways
 pehla to yah ki vah congress ke adhyaksh bane or doosraa siyasat main unhen modi ke khilaaf ek majboot vipakshi netaa ke taur par ubhaar diya
 After getting into active politics, Rahul tried a lot but his party had to face defeat in many states
 is daur main bijepi kii ore se congress mukt bharat kaa naaraa diya gaya or soshal media main unke netritv kshamta par sawaal uthaae jane lage or logon ne jamkar unka majaak bhi udaaya
 The atmosphere changed with the Gujarat election, the Gujarat election proved to be a 'sanjeevani Booti' for him and added a new color and zeal to his lost political career
 unhone pichley chunaavon ke ulat gujarat main rahakar na sirf lagaataar prachaar kiya balki logon se milte rahe or janata kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye wo sab kuch kiya jo ek manze hue rajaneta karte hai
 Now the result of Gujarat elections has come and the Congress may not have won but it gave a tough fight to the BJP under Rahul's leadership
 unke aalochak ab unhen sanjidagi se lenge
 Although the image of the opposition leader as Rahul seems to be building now, he still has to work hard to maintain it
 rahul gandhi ko yah yaad rakhana hoga ki jis party ke vah mukhiya bane hai, uski chhavi abhi desh main acchhee nahin he
 It is continuously losing in every state
 vahiin narendra modi or amit shah ke rup main bhaajapa kaa sheersh netritv lagaataar 'congress mukt' bharat kii baat kar rahaa he, abhi ke jo halaat he uske aadhaar par vah apane mishan main kaamyaab hota dikh bhi rahaa he
 At present, only 4 states are ruled by the Congress, while in 1991, the BJP, which ruled only 4 states, currently holds power in 19 states
 rahul kii chunautiyaancongress ke nae adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saamne dheron chunautiyaan he
 The performance of the Congress in Gujarat can be considered good, but it should not be forgotten that the BJP has been in governance for 22 years and there was an anti-incumbency against it, despite this, it managed to save power
 rahul ko party mukhyalay main purna badlaav laana hi hoga balki rajyon main apni party ko majboot karnaa hoga
 At the same time, local workers have to be encouraged by their frustrated and frustrated
 unhone kuch saal pehle party kii majboot banane ke liye sthaneey str jo prayaas shuru kiye the, use phir se amal main laana hoga
 The Congress should take a lesson from its staunch opposition party BJP that it is gaining ground in states like West Bengal, Kerala, Odisha and Tamil Nadu where it has no support base
 iske ulat unki party hi aisi party he jiskaa kabhi desh ke har rajya main janaadhar tha
 Now regrouping it will be Rahul's biggest challenge
 is chunaav ke baad unhen har rajya kaa daura karnaa hoga, or zyada se zyada kaaryakartaaon se milakar party ko phir se mukhyadhara main laane kii yojana banani hogi
 Next year there are elections in 8 states including Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, they too should join the electoral mission on the lines of BJP

 He also told that cyber attackers usually work under the underground, which makes it difficult to identify these attackers or their bases
 ise atake ko duniyabar main ab tak kaa sabase bada sibar atake mana ja rahaa he

 77 lakh maton kii ginati se unki jeet sunishchit ho chuki thi or uski aupchaarik ghoshnaa bhar baaki thi

 He also said while forming a political party that he has come to change politics and will not do anything like the old leaders
 lekin ab unki apni party ke vidhayak chaahate hai ki unki tankhwaah bade

 ye twit kejariwal ne us samay netaaon par tanj kasate hue kiye the
 In March 2012, Kejriwal had tweeted, "in the last 44 years, political parties have not been able to reach a consensus on the Lokpal issue, but when it comes to increasing their salary, they decide in 5 minutes
 ' bataa den ki 2012 main kejariwal ne ye twit lokapal kii maang ko lekar sirf ek samajasevi ke rup main kiye the
 After this, at the end of the year 2012, Kejriwal formed a political organization called Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 unhone raajnneetik dal banaate samay bhi kaha tha ki vah raajnneeti ko badalane ke liye aae hai or puraane netaaon kii tarah kuch nahin karenge
 But now the mlas of his own party want his salary to increase
 yahi nahin dilli vidhansabha adhyaksh dwaara gathit kii gai cameti ne 400 fisadi tankhwaah badhotaree kii sifarish bhi kar di
 If this recommendation is accepted, then the mlas of Delhi will be paid more than the mlas of any state of the country

 Up to 2 lakh rupees per month
 vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki apana ghar or offis chalaane ke liye unhen philhal jo selary milti he vah naakaafi he
 Although Kejriwal remains very active on Twitter, he has not spoken or tweeted yet in terms of salary hike of mlas
 unki party ke varisht netaa ashutosh ne mangalvaar raat jarur ek twit kiya, jisamen likhaa tha - 'kisi bha party ke eemaandaar vidhayak ke liye is alp selary main ghar, offis or apane vidhansabha kshetra kaa sanchaalan karnaa naammumkin he
 The dishonest do not even need a salary
 ' On Wednesday, Youth Congress leaders gathered outside Kejriwal's house in large numbers to protest against the increase in salary of mlas
 bataa den ki isi saal farvari main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai thi
 BJP has three members in the assembly and this party is also opposing the increase in salary of mlas
 tippaniyan BJP leader and one of the three mlas, Vijender Gupta, says that the AAP has now become a 'khasan Aadmi Party'
 vidhayakon kii tankhwaah main badhotaree maamle main kai logon ne kejariwal kii aalochana kii he

 The BJP has complained to the Election Commission on the statement given by Rahul Gandhi with his hand in the mass pain conference
 uttar pradesh bijepi ne lakhanu main chif elactoral officer se shikaayat kii he ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he, kyonki rahul gandhi ne dharmik coment kiya he
 The Uttar Pradesh BJP has complained to the Election Commission that the manner in which Rahul Gandhi has said in the Jana Veda Sammelan that the symbol of the Congress hand is like the claws of the deities
 yah sidhaa-sidhaa chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he, kyonki rahul gandhi ne dharmik aadhaar par apane simbel kii vyakhya kii he
 In fact, at the conference at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi had said that the Congress party is 100 years old and one day when he was looking at the photo, he saw the Congress symbol in Shivji's photo
 rahul ne kaha, 'shivaji kii photo main congress kaa chinh he to phir maine sochaa ki bhai duusari photo dekhtaa hum, maine guru nanak ji kaa photo dekhi usamen congress kaa chinh he, maine buddha kii photo dekhi, usamen congress kaa chinh he, mahavir ji kii photo dekhi usamen congress kaa chinh he, hazrat ali ji kaa photo dekhi, usamen congress kaa chinh he'
 Rahul further said, 'after this i immediately went to Karan Singh ji and i said that Karan Singh ji, please tell me one thing that in every religion, Islam in Hinduism, Sikhism in Buddhism, Mahavira is also in the religion of Jews
 What is happening? yah sab jagah congress party ke haath kaa nishaan kyon dikhaai de rahaa he to mujhase kaha ki vartmaan paristhitiyon main sachai kaa saamana karo apane prajence se daro mat'

 Without worrying about this at all, Sahni first injected pain reliever and then injected with antibiotics without much thought
 iskaa asar bhi hua
 The pain went away and Arvind was rushed to a hospital in Samastipur, 19 km from Lohagir, for further treatment
 47 varshiya saahani stenescope, injection lagane kii suiyaan or chuninda antibiotic, penkiller or antiallergic dawaaiyon kaa sangrah hameshaa saath lekar chalate hai
 In addition, his brown bag contains a number of injection vials and saline bottles
