 In the program, between senior journalist and former director of Prasar Bharati, Mrinal Pandey, senior psychologist and sociologist Ashish Nandy and Fellow of the Development Society Studies Chair and Director of Indian Language Program Abhay Kumar Dubey on the subject of 'ethnographic History of Books'
 Discussion concluded

 In the first phase of the program, Abhay Kumar Dubey said, 'it is impossible to ethnography the history of books, because its surface is so wide and varied that it cannot be measured by a single unit
 kitabon kii duniya athaah he or iskaa har ek bhaag khud bada itihaas samete hue hai
 He said that all those who come in it are directly and indirectly attached to the book
 chaahe vah prakaashak, lekhak, padhane vaala yaa chapikhane main kitaaben chhapane vaala
 Similarly, the classification of books is also different
 'ashish nandi ne apane vichaar rakhte hue likhit banaam maukhik parampara ke sawaal ko sabhyatik str par uthaaya

 Cancer is a disease whose people start feeling anxious as soon as they hear its name
 kai log ise laailaaj beemaari ke naam se jaanate hai to kuch log ise dardanaak maut ke rup main
 Cancer is seen as another aspect of death more than disease
 kisi ko cancer he matlab ab uski jindagi ke kuch hi din bache hai
 but it's not like that
 haa cancer ek badi beemaari he lekin laailaaj nahin
 Therefore, it is important to keep complete information about it and not to believe the things heard
 cancer ko lekar kai tarah kii baaten or myth logon main dehshat failaae hue hai
 Let's know about the truth related to this
 
 
 cancer matlab moutis tathy ko galat nahin kah sakate lekin yah puri tarah sahi bhi nahin he
 If cancer is recognized in its early days, then its treatment is possible
 cancer kai prakaar kaa hota he or isliye iske ilaaj kii prakriya bhi alag hoti he
 But cancer is not an incurable disease
 is beemaari main sharir puri tarah kharaab ho jaataa hecancer ek aisi beemaari he jo sharir ke duusare angon par bhi prabhaav daalati he
 But this does not mean that it spoils the body
 cancer ke ilaaj main medical science kaaphi aage aa chukaa haijahaan par ab chemotherapy or radiotherapy ke jariye marij kii jindagi ko or behatar banane kaa kiya ja rahaa hai
 Pain is caused by the onset of this disease
 The pain is a painful disease but the nature of every cancer is different
 kai baar to cancer ke lakshan apane shuruaati dinon main hi dikhne lagate hai lekin ham unhen pahchaan nahin pate, jaise- bina dard kii gaathen yaa phir kisi bhi prakaar kaa ulcer hona
 Therefore, do not ignore any problem related to the body and keep your checkup from time to time
 cancer chuaachhut kii beemaari hecancer kii beemaari se judaa yah sabase badha myth he
 Cancer is not a disease with infection
 yah beemaari hamaare sharir main maujuud cells se hoti he
 It never spreads by touching or contacting one person to another
 isliecancer se peedit insaan ko normal jivan jeene ke liye prerit karenor unki jindagi ko behatar banane ke liye unhen har tarah se saport karen
 It is possible to treat cancer, cancer should be treated with complete care and treatment
 kisi bhi nattejey par pahunchane se pehle saare test or sabhi medical jaanch karvaa lenaa bahut jaruri hota he
 No alternative medicine for cancer treatment has come yet, so do not start any treatment without doctor's advice
 tumor se cancer hota haiaisa sambhav he lekin jaruri nahin kii har tumor cancer kaa kaaran ho
 Nowadays, doctors treat them very carefully so that tumors do not cause cancer
 mumbai main ek chaar saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath skool main chhedchhad kiye jane kaa sharmnaak maamla saamne aayaa he
 Where an employee of the school took the girl to the school toilet by making excuses and committed indecent acts with her there
 soochna milane ke baad police ne aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya he

 Ashutosh Gowariker's film Panipat has been released
 film kii kahani darshakon ko khub pasand bhi aa rahi he
 Panipat is doing well at the box office
 arjuna kapur or kriti senon starer film kii kahani aitihaasik ghatana par aadhaarit he isliye film ke saath vivaad bhi jud gaya he
 Demonstrations are also going on in Rajasthan
 film main maharaja surajmal ko laalchee shaasha bataane kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, Surajmal is also opposed to speaking a language other than Braj in the film
 is vivaad par itihaaskaar mahendra singh sikarwaar ne kaha, 'panipat film main maharaja surajmal ke kirdaar ko tod marodakar pesh kiya gaya he jo galat he, jabaki is kirdaar ko itihaas ke anusaar darshaya janaa chahie tha'
 Why is the film opposed in Rajasthan? Former Bharatpur Maharaja and Rajasthan government's tourism minister Vishvendra Singh has lodged his protest against the character of Jat Maharaj Surajmal in the Panipat film
 is maamle main rajasthan ke jat samudaay ne andolan kii bhi dhamkee di he
 BJP state president of Rajasthan Satish Poonia has also protested against the portrayal of Maharaja Suraj Mal in the film and sought to correct it
 bharatpur ke purv maharaja or paryaton mantri vishvendra singh ne press relies jari kar kaha ki aitihaasik tathyon se chhedchhad karte hue bharatpur ke maharaja surajmal jat jaise mahaan purush kaa chithran 'panipat' film main behad galat tareeke se kiya gaya he
 He said, 'I am from the 14th generation of Maharaja Surajmal Jat
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki peshwa or maratha jab panipat yuddh harkar laut rahe the to maharaja surajmal or maharani kishori ne 6 maah tak sampurna maratha sena or peshwaon ko apane yahaan panaah di thi
 My request to the government is that a committee should be formed that if a film is made on a dynasty or a great person, permission should be obtained from the family and society before releasing such a movie '
 rajasthan main bharatpur ke purv maharaja surajmal kii veerta or parakram ko lekar kahaniyaan kahi jaati hai
 Political parties also use his name heavily for Jat votes
 aise main surajmal ke charitra ko jis tarah se film main darshaya gaya he use lekar virodh shuru ho gaya he

 monsoon satr ke tisare din yani aaj avishvaas prastaav par voting honi he, aise main sadan satr hangaamedaar rah saktaa he
 At the same time, the opposition may get stuck in a game started by itself
 darasal, vipaksh ke paas sankhya bal nahin he, aise main sawaal uthta he ki avishvaas prastaav se vipaksh kaa koun-sa hit sadhane vaala he? aakhri congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa game plan kya he?gaur ho ki rahul gandhi ne apane ek bayaan main kaha tha ki mujhe bas 15 minute kaa mauka de den, bukamp aa jayega
 So the 15-minute time has come for Congress President Rahul Gandhi, which he had been demanding for the last several months
 aaj desh dekhegaa ki rahul apane 15 minute ke bhaashan main kaisaa bukamp laa pate hai kyonki ab tak rahul sansad se zyada sansad ke baahar garajte najar aae hai
 However, it is not difficult to guess what Rahul will say
 wo sansad ke baahar vibhinn masalon par sarkaar par barasate rahe hai
 Even today his speech in Parliament can be seen revolving around him
 avishvaas prastaav ke peeche rahul kii ranneeti bhi yahi he ki sansad main modi sarkaar ko gheraa ja sake
 Rahul's strategy would be to make the image of a poor government in front of the country by counting the failures of the Modi government
 rahul un aaropon ko phir se doharaa sakate hai ki
 
 
 > Small businesses closed down due to demonetisation
 > jiesti se kaarobaariyon ko nuksaan hua
 > The price of petrol and diesel is not under control
 > tel, daal, sabji ke daam badhate gaye hai
 > The murders at the hands of the mob have increased tremendously
 > bank ghotaalon kii baadh aa gai he
 > Can take up the case of Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya
 > saath hi swiss bainkon main bharatiyon ke jamaa dhan main ijaphe kaa mudda uthaate hue sarkaar par ye aarope laga sakate hai ki modi sarkaar videsh se kaala dhan laane main naakaam rahi he
 Overall, the Congress wants to prepare the 2019 pitch by encircling the government on the largest platform in the country
 lekin, sarkaar ko gherne ke mansoobey main rahul kitne kaamyaab honge iskaa pataa to aaj shaam tak hi chal paaegaa, kyonki unka mukaable sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi se hoga jo un par tikhaa palatwaar karne main kabhi chookte nahin hai
 In such a situation, there is a huge majority and above all a powerful speaker like PM Modi, in such a situation, the risk is big for Rahul
 kahin is avishvaas prastaav se napha kam or nuksaan zyada naa ho jaae

 lekin ek sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki id kii taarikh chhodega koun? rais yaa sultan? If you pay attention to the talk of Shahrukh Khan, 'raees' will be released on Eid because that film has started earlier and will be ready in January, while the work of 'sultan' is still pending
 shahrukh ne media ko die bayaan main kaha he, "rais agle 20 din main puri ho jaayegi
 Aditya Chopra, Salman Khan and Ali Abbas Zafar are all friends, so we can all sit back and exchange dates

 agar shahrukh khan kii baton par dhyaan den to 'rais' id par release hogi kyonki vah film pehle shuru hui he or janvari main banakar taiyaar ho jaayegi vahin 'sultan' kaa kaam abhi bahut baaqi he
 Shah Rukh has said in a statement to the media, "raees will be completed in the next 20 days
 aditya chopra, salmaan khan or ali abbaas zafar, sab dost hai isliye ham sab aapas main baithkar isaki taarikh ko aage peeche kar sakate hai

 2 in GDP, especially in the first quarter
 2 fisadi kii giravat ke baad vipaksh ne iske liye notebandi ke faisle ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 At the same time, the opposition also surrounded the government on the employment front and said that the government has also failed on the promise of providing 2 crore jobs to the youth every year
 petrol-dijal kii keemton ko lekar bhi sarkaar nishane par he
 These questions are troubling the government 1
 kyon gir rahi he GDP? kya notebandi he vajah?vitt varsh kii pehali timahi ke jab aankade aae to sarkaar ko bada jhatka laga
 2 directly into GDP

 It was reduced to 7 percent
 vipaksh ne ise notebandi ke faisle kaa asar bataaya or kaha ki notebandi lagu hone ke vakt hi manmohan singh ne chetaya tha ki isse jidipi main 2 fisadi tak giravat aegi jo ki sahi sabit hui
 The Congress termed the Modi government's economic policies a failure
 ab sarkaar ke saamne ye bada sawaal he ki kaise sakaaratmak aarthik aankadon ke saath aage bade kyonki 2019 main aam chunaav hone hai or 17 maheene se zyada kaa samay sarkaar ke paas nahin bachaa he
 Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has fallen for the sixth consecutive quarter

 It will not be possible to achieve economic growth rate of 5 percent

 There are challenges before exports too

 CAD has increased mainly due to widening trade deficit

 Why not create new jobs despite Make in India? In the 2014 election campaign, Modi had promised to create 2 crore jobs every year for the youth of the country
 lekin is morche par aaj sarkaar sabase zyada ghirti hui dikh rahi he
 However, the government started schemes like Make in India and Skill Development with very big claims
 lekin rojgaar srijan ke aankade kuch lakh se aage nahin bad paa rahe
 In the recent cabinet reshuffle, when the Minister for Skill Development Rajiv Pratap Rudyka became the minister, it was also attributed to the failure in the job creation target

 Modi said that there is a problem for a few months and then the flourished India will be in front of you
 lekin hua kya arabiai ke paas pehle se bhi zyada paisa aa gaya
 That is, fake and black money also came into the economy
 iske alaava sarkaar ne videshon se kaala dhan waapas laane kaa bhi vaada kiya tha
 Even on this front, no major success has been seen so far

 Why is the fear of businessmen not ending with GST? The government implemented GST in a grand ceremony on midnight on 1 July and called it the biggest tax revolution in the country after independence
 ab teen maheene puure hone ja rahe hai lekin abhi bhi kaarobaari puri tarah se is system se nahin jud paae hai
 BJP MP and economic affairs expert himself, Subrahmanyam Swamy, questions this, saying that there is an atmosphere of anarchy about how to file GST, what is its system
 kaarobaar par iske asar ke aankade to abhi saamne aane baaki he
 Even if they remain negative, the difficulties will increase for the government

 Is there any way to check the rising prices of petrol and diesel? The ever increasing prices of petrol and diesel are also increasing the difficulty of the Modi government
 sarkaar ne 15 din par keemton kii samiksha kii jagah dianemic keemten lagu kii thim ye kehete hue keemten ghatate vakt logon ko usee din se iskaa phayda milane lagegaa
 But people away from this, petrol prices have gone up by Rs 7 in the last three months
 soshal media par logon main isapar kaaphi gussa dikhaa
 People questioned the government why not bring it in GST
 petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhankhud isapar safai dene aae or dianemic fere kaa bachaav kiya
 This pricing mechanism is being questioned because when the crude oil prices were around $ 107 per barrel in May 2014, the prices of petrol and diesel in Delhi were 71 respectively
 41 rupee or 60 rupee prati litre thi
 Now the price of crude oil is only around $ 54 per barrel in the international market, yet till 14 September 2017, the price of petrol is around 70 in May 2014
 39 rupee prati litre or usee prakaar dijal kii keemat 58

 How will Modi's big promises be fulfilled in 17 months? General elections are to be held in 2019 and BJP has already started preparing for the mission 2019 at the organization level, but ultimately the election will have to go about the work of the Modi government
 aise kai vaade hai jo modi ne chunaav ke vakt kiye the
 After winning the election, PM Modi promised that in 2019, he will put his report card in front of the public
 chunaav se pehle janata piem modi se un vaadon par jawaab jarur chaahegi?kya kiye the bade vaade--mek in india ke jariye desh main rojgaar badhanaa-har saal do karod rojgaar srijan karnaa-pakistan samet padosi deshon se nipatane main sakht rukh-ganga safai-har gaanv tak bijli conection-kaala dhan desh waapas lanachunaav main jane se pehle sarkaar ko aarthik halaat kii sakaaratmak tasviir pesh kerani hogi

 Manoj Singh, 23, who lives in Ashrafabad village in Azamgarh, belongs to a very poor family
 pita ek thodi si jameen par kheti karte hai jisase unke parivaar kaa guzaara nahin ho paata
 To reduce his father's burden, Manoj thought of becoming a teacher

 When Manoj matched the answer by bringing home the carbon copy of the answer book in the written examination, he was confident that he would get good marks
 manoj shikshak banane ke sapane dekhne lage
 But on 13 August, when the exam results came, Manoj's dreams were shattered
 ve pariksha main fail ho chuke the
 Manoj says, "I was given only 19 marks in the written test, while matching the answer with carbon copy, i was confident of not getting less than 80 marks at any cost
 ’’unhone bhartee prakriya yojit karaane vaali sanstha pariksha niamak praadhikari karyaalay, elahabaad main copy dekhne kaa prayaas kiya par safalataa nahin mili
 Frustrated Manoj took refuge in the High Court
 court ke aadesh se manoj ko uttar pustika kii ‘scan’ copy dekhne ko mili
 Manoj was surprised when he saw the scan copy
 likhit pariksha main 19 ank paakar bhartee prakriya se baahar ho jane vaale manoj ko uttar pustika main 98 ank mili the
 Manjeet's friend and Ankeet Verma, who lives in his neighboring village Bilawal in Azamgarh, was declared a failure by 22 marks in the result, while in the answer book he got 122 marks

 On August 13, after the result of the recruitment of assistant teacher, the candidates were demonstrating in this demand for investigation of the mess
 31 agast ko hycourt kii lakhanu khandpid ne jab anusuchit jati kii abhyarthi sonika devi kii copy pariksha niamak praadhikari se talab kii to gadbaditon se pardaa uth gaya
 The court finds that only the copy of Sonika Devi has changed

 After this, the candidate
 yon ke bhavishya ke saath hua khilwaad puri tarah saamne aa gaya
 Those candidates in large numbers

 At the same time, two such candidates were declared successful in the recruitment process who did not even appear in the examination

 Says Mishra, "the BJP, which has been accused of falsifying selection institutions in opposition governments, is no longer able to devise a mechanism in its government that can improve the image of these institutions
" shikshak bhartee main gadabadi isaki misaal he
 As soon as the government officials crackdown on tainted officers, the officers who were involved in the recruitment process at the Examination Regulatory Office in Allahabad were burnt shortly after the action was taken against the officials guilty of teacher recruitment
 maukey par pahunche abhyarthirayon ko inhen jali kapiyon ke bich chaatra sonika devi kii jali hui oemar shit bhi mili jisane hycourt main yachika daayar kar apni copy badale jane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Sutta Singh, who was posted as Secretary, Examination Regulatory Office, has become a reason for grudge in the recruitment process of the BJP government
 sutta singh ke kaarykaal main us daagi agency par bharosa jataakar use shikshak paatrata pariksha (tiiti)-2017 kii jimmedaari saunpi gai jis par madhyamik shiksha chayan board kii pravaktaa, snaatak shikshak bhartee pariksha or varsh 2013 kii tiiti main gadabadi karne kaa aarope tha
 On this, the Director, State Educational Research and Academic Council had sought a reply from the then Secretary, Examination Regulatory Authority, but nothing went before Sutt Singh's hank
 meharbaani kaa alam yah tha ki sutta singh ko nilambit karne se pehle sarkaar ne unhen shikshak bhartee prakriya main aniyamitata ke aarope jaanchane ke liye sachiv, basic shiksha manisha trighatiya kii adhyakshata main bani cameti kaa sadsy banaaya tha
 Jitendra Shahi of Allahabad, who agitated against the mess in teacher recruitment, says, "the examination regulatory authority office is responsible for the mess in the recruitment process
" iske tatkaaleen sachiv ko hi jaanch samiti kaa sadsy banaakar sarkaar ne puure mudde ko thande baste main daalane kii chaal chali thi jo hycourt ke hastkshep ke baad saamne aa gai
 There have also been questions over the appointment of Sanjay Sinha, former secretary of the Basic Education Council, to a key post for a long time
 har kadam par golmaalasanjay bhusreddy kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti ko kai staron par gadbaditon kaa pataa chalaa he
 It has come to know that the examination regulatory authority office did not 'crosscheck' them on several levels before entering the numbers of the tested copies
 kaapiyon ke moolyankan ke baad number ‘award blank’ par chadaaye gaye the
 Barcode numbers or other information have been entered in many candidates' copies instead of marks
 kuch anupasthit abhyarthiyon ke aage number darj ho gaye or upasthit abhyarthihayon ko anupasthit dikhaa diya gaya
 In order to maintain transparency in the examination, most of the examinations in the country are being conducted on OMR sheet in a multiple choice manner
 iske ulat shikshak bhartee pariksha ‘subjective’ dhang se karai gai
 "there is always scope for manipulation of numbers in subjective examination," says Siddharth Kumar, who appeals to the High Court to protest against teacher recruitment disturbances
 yah baat shikshak bhartee ke nattejey se ab sabit ho gai he
 "some other officers and employees can be acted upon in the recruitment process," the report of the inquiry committee said
 jaanch samiti ko is baat ke spasht pramaan mili hai ki likhit pariksha ke ank darj karne main bade paimaane par gadabadi hui he, so nirdhaarit padon ke saapeksh kaaphi kam anjayrthi uteern hue the
 Now that the government has distributed appointment letters to the selected candidates, the biggest concern before them is about the selection of new candidates
 duvidha is baat ko lekar he ki kis tarah puraa parinaam nae sire se ghoshit kiya jaae
 If merit is created afresh, there will be change in the allocated district of many candidates
 pichhali sapa sarkaar main hui bhartiyon par sawaal khadey karne vaali bhaajapa ab loksabhaa chunaav se pehle pradesh main apni sarkaar main khud unheen sawaalon se ghir gai he

 At a distance, the teacher was expressing anger against the government by shaving hair
 ye vittvihin shikshak the jo maandey kii maang ko lekar kai dinon se andolnarat the
 His performance disrupted the government program that was being held, and its pain was also seen in the Chief Minister's speech
 unhone tanj kasate hue kaha, ‘‘aaj ve log bhi sir mundwakar shikshak kaa sammaan maang rahe hai jo isaki yogyata nahin rakhte
 The Chief Minister rejected the demand for honorarium of these financially illiterate teachers, saying that they do not have any merit
 par shiksha vibhaag kii raay unase juda he
 On August 30, the Director of Secondary Education wrote a letter to the Chief Executive Officer of the Chief Minister Ajay Kumar Singh that the policy of payment of honorarium of teachers in non-financial schools is under consideration at the government level, so their demand is policy
 shiksha nideshak ke is patr ne pradesh ke 21,000 vittvihin collejon ke 1,92,000 shikshakon ko pichhali sapa kii sarkaar main mil rahe maandey kii maang ko nitigat tehra diya
 In the year 1986, the then State Government added Rule 7 (a) (a) to the 'intermediate Education Act' -1921, under which permission was given to open financial college for two years for teaching new subjects from class 9 to class 12
 in collejon ko sarkaar se kisi tarah kii madad nahin milani thi
 Due to this policy, there was a flood of financeless colleges in the state, which started giving jobs to teachers at very low salaries
 25 varshon main aise vittvihin collejon kii sankhya 21,000 paar kar gai or inhone saadhe teen lakh shikshakon ko kam vetan par rojgaar diya
 In the year 2010, the High Court considered these financeless teachers as voters in the elections for the teacher constituency in the Legislative Council
 pradesh main vittvihin shikshakon kii baari sankhya ne apane bich se lakhanu se vidhaan parishad main shikshak chunaav kshetra main lakhanu se ummidavaar umesh dvivedi or bareli se sanjay mishra ko chunaav jitayaa
 After this election and before the 2017 assembly elections, the then SP government wooed these teachers

 After the formation of the BJP government in March last year, the budgetary provision for honorarium of non-finance teachers was scrapped
 sarkaar kaa tark he ki vittvihin college prabandhan manyata lete vakt yah shapathpatr detaa he ki vah sarkaar se koi madad nahin maangega
 Says an official of the Department of Secondary Education, "in the SP government the mandate giving honorarium to undeclared teachers clearly states that it should not be considered as an illustration in future
" so bajet main iskaa praavdhaan nahin kiya gaya he
 "uttar Pradesh Secondary Financeless Teacher General Assembly General Secretary Ajay Singh" Advocate "is preparing to intensify the teachers' movement

 The government is not spending a single penny on the three and a half lakh teachers who shape their future, due to which they are living life in extreme poverty

 After this, the proposed teacher recruitment examination on March 12 had to be postponed
 baad main court ne teen prashnon ko galat mana
 Cut-off: On May 27, a rule before the proposed teacher recruitment test, the government changed the cut-off to 33 percent for OBC and general candidates and 30 percent for SC-ST

 Due to incorrect process of reservation, only 34,660 candidates were declared successful in the final

 Later on the instructions of the Chief Minister, the appointment letters were distributed to the candidates

 com / ffehbivqf5 Maharishi Kapil's tomb was broken
 jyon hi maharishi ne apane aagney netra khole, tyon hi sari praja bhasma ho gai
 It was only for the salvation of these dead people that Bhagiratha, son of Maharaja Dilip, did harsh penance
 bhageerath ke tap se prasann hokar brahma ne unase var maangane ko kaha to bhageerath ne 'ganga' kii maang kii
 On this, Brahma said- 'rajan! Do you want Ganga to descend on Earth? But have you asked Prithvi that she will be able to handle the weight and velocity of the Ganges? i think only Lord Shankar has the power to handle the velocity of the Ganges
 isliye uchit yah hoga ki ganga kaa bhaar evam veg sanbhaalane ke liye bhagwaan shiv kaa anugrah praapt kar liya jaae
 'maharaja Bhagiratha did the same
 tippaniyan Pleased with his harsh penance, Brahma left the Ganges stream from his kamandal
 tab bhagwaan shiv ne ganga kii dhara ko apni jataaon main sametakar jataaen baandh leen
 As a result, Ganga could not find a way out of the jata
 ab maharaj bhageerath ko or bhi adhik chintaa hui
 He once again started austerities in worship of Lord Shiva
 tab kahin bhagwaan shiv ne ganga kii dhara ko mukt karne kaa vardaan diya
 In this way, after getting rid of Shiva's jata, Gangaji turned to the plains of the Himalayas every day and turned towards the plain
 is prakaar bhageerath prithvi par ganga kaa varan karke bade bhaagyashaalee hue

 Now King Bhagiratha was more worried
 unhone ek baar phir bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana main ghor tap shuru kiya
 Then Lord Shiva gave a boon to free the Ganges
 is prakaar shivaji kii jataaon se chhot kar gangaji himalay kii ghaatiyon main kal-kal ninaad karke maidan kii ore mudi
 In this way Bhagiratha got very lucky after the Ganges on earth

 ) Rohit Shekhar Murder Case: uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri swa
 Sheikh's wife Apoorva Tiwari has been arrested by the Delhi Police 9 days later in the case of Rohit Shekhar Murder Case, the son of ND Tiwari
 krime branch ke mutabik, 'rohit (rohit Shekhar Tiwari) ke saath shaadishuda jindagi se apurva shukla tiwari (apoorva Shukla Tiwari) khush nahin thi
 This is the reason that Apoorva strangled Rohit and stabbed him to death
 ' krime branch kaa yah bhi kahana he ki is hatya main koi or anya shaamil nahin tha
 Let me tell you, Rohit Shekhar and Apoorva first met through the metromonial site
 indore kii rahane vaali 34 saal kii apurva peshey se vakil hai,donon kii mulaakaat metromonial site ke jariye hui thi
 After this, in 2017, the two met in Lucknow and sat down
 phir 31 march ko rohit or apurva kii sagaai hui or 11 may ko dilli main paanch ashoka road sthit anand bhawan main saat phere liye the
 At the time when Rohit and Apoorva got married, ND Tiwari was admitted to Max Hospital
 police ke mutabik apurva ne shaadi rohit kii haisiyat or rasookh dekhakar kii thi lekin wo jo sapane dekhakar aayi thim wo ek ek kar chakanachur hone lage,donon ke bich rohit kii aadaton ,sampatti or paariwarik rishton ke lekar jhagada hone laga,jhagada itnaa bad gaya ki ek hi ghar main rohit or apurva alag alag kamare main rahane lage
 What Rohit Shekhar's wife claimed to the police in the Rohit Shekhar murder case was shocking
 police kaa maananaa he ki ek vakil hone ke naate use pataa he ki kanoon se kaise bachanaa he isliye wo ye daawa hatya ko ek durghatana bataane ke liye kar rahi ho
 Because Rohit was very drunk at that time
 police ne is maamle main dhara 302 ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya tha or usee ke tahat police ne apurva ko giraftaar kiya he
 That is, Apoorva has been arrested in the murder charge and it will be known only later that the police change the section in this case
 rohit shekhar tiwari kii hatya ke peeche do kaaran ho sakate hai
 For one thing, something was not going well between Rohit and Apoorva
 shaadi ke baad se hi donon ke bich jhagade hua karte the
 The second is to grab Rohit's property
 
 
 rohit kii maa ujjwala ne apni bahu apurva or uske parivaar par laalchee hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki ve paariwarik sampatti hadapna chaahate the
 They had earlier said that there were fights between the couple from the first day of marriage
 unhone bhi rohit kii patni par andeh jataayaa tha

 Trump's tweets were described by Britain's opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn as disgusting and dangerous
 corbin ne kaha, 'mujhe ummid he ki hamaari bhavishya kii sarkaar donald trump dwaara ati dakshinpanthi ritviton kii ninda karegi
 They are disgusting, dangerous and a threat to our society
 'white house ne kiya bachaaviske baad white house ne raashtrapati donald trump dwaara dhur-dakshinpanthi british acount par daale gaye muslim virdohi video ko ri-twit kiye jane kaa bachaav kiya
 The White House argued that Trump had been raising the issue of national security for a long time

 He said, "see, at the moment we are considering the problems faced in passing government laws due to differences in immigration policy

 Another possible name is that of Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, but it will depend on the stance of the Congress leadership as UPA-2 is facing crisis after crisis in the current alliance era and Mukherjee's role has become very important

 donald trump america ke raashtrapati banane ke baad pehali baar china gaye the or china par trump ke vichaar bahut tikhe rahe hai
 In such a situation, China tried to make Trump happy in a way by welcoming them like emperors
 trump ne bijnes deal bhi kii, or china ko america companiyon ke bijnes ke liye kuch or darvaaze kholane par majaboor bhi kiya
 But after that when Trump reached Vietnam, he sidelined every aspect of China
 china ke liye chidhaane vaali baat ye rahi ki vietnam main trump ne jinping kaa naam nahin liya, balki narendra modi kaa naam le liya
 On the trump's tongue as soon as he left China, 'modi-modi' actually Donald Trump teased China that ever since India opened the doors of its economy
 tab se bharat ne apane madhyam varg ke liye avasaron kii ek nai duniya banaai he
 Prime Minister Modi is engaged in uniting this vast country and all its people
 or vastav main wo bahut badi safalataa ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 India's success and praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and that too from the platform of 21 countries of Asia Pacific, which does not have India
 jis manch par america ke saath sabase badi takat china ban chukaa he
 This statement of Donald Trump must have hurt China, because for the last three days he was engaged in such kind of Donald Trump
 jisamen raajaaon jaisaa satkar karne main koi kasar nahin chodi gai
 But all this hospitality trumps wasted as soon as they left China
 america raashtrapati donald trump apni patni melania ke saath pehali baar china ke daure par gaye the
 When he landed in Beijing on 8 November, Jinping took Trump and his wife to the ancient Forbidden City Palace
 ye pracheen forbydan city pales wo jagah he jahaan san 1420 ke baad se china ke raja rahaa karte theisse jinping ye dikhaanaa chaahate the ki wo pehali baar aae donald trump ko kisi samraat jaisaa satkar de rahe hai
 The two leaders also praised each other a lot, with Donald Trump describing Jinping as the King of China
 china ne trump ke is daure se america or china ke takaraav ke bich ek nai disha dene vaala bataane kii koshish kii
 Jinping also gave several gifts to the visiting trump to appease Donald Trump, who was hinting at making confrontational policies with China
 - america or china ke bich 20 hazaar karod dollar ke vyapaar samjhaute kiye gaye
 - Ranging from jet engines, car parts and shale gas agreements
 - trump ke jate hi jinping ne china ke banking sector main videshi companiyon ke liye malikana haq ke niyam naram kar die
 - After three days in China, as soon as Trump arrived in Vietnam, he started pulling China
 - china galat tareekon se vyapaar karata he, dusron kaa phayda uthaata he, unki mushkil badhaata he, jisase balance bigadaa he
 As soon as he arrived in Vietnam, Donald Trump said, "I have just come to China in an open and direct conversation with President Xi Jinping, which talks about China's practice of doing business in the wrong ways
" jis tarah se vyapaar ghaataa he

 Experts associated with the tourism industry believe that this 'desert Festival' is losing its identity due to new programs and not changing the venue to entice tourists to the world-famous Maru Festival which started nearly three and a half decades ago
 paryaton se jude logon evam paryatakon kaa kahana he ki 'desert festival' kii ore sailaaniyon kaa rujhaan bhi kam hone laga he
 Assistant Director of Tourism, Tourism, Development Pandya said that changes and new programs are added from time to time
 haalanki yahaan kii samskruti se jude kaaryakramon ko band nahin kiya ja saktaa hai
 He said that the tourists come from the culture of Jaisalmer to be familiar with it
 phir bhi is baar maru mahotsav main nae kaarykram va nae kaarykram sthalon ko jodne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 Jaisalmer Tourism Business Federation President Jitendra Singh says that the outline of the events of this fair, which has been organized for 30 years, was still intact till date
 paryaton vibhaag ne kabhi bhi ise badalane kii koshish nahin kii
 Even the program sites have not been changed
 unhone kaha ki lakeer kaa fakir banakar vahi puraane aayojan karwaae ja rahe hai
 Maru Mahotsav holds various camel-related competitions, Rajasthani costumes and living-related competitions and evenings adorned with Rajasthani folk music
 varshon se ho rahi in pratiyogitaaon ke liye rujhaan bhi kam ho rahaa he
 The only 'mr Desert' competition has more participants so far
 shesh sabhi pratiyogitaaon main pratiyogiyon kii sankhya bahut hi kam ho gai he
 Tourism businessman Meghraj Parihar said that the number of changes that have been made so far in the programs of Maru Festival is only Khanapurti
 badlaav ke naam par mukhya rup se shobhaayatra ravaanaa hone kaa sthaan parivartan hota he
 Sometimes the procession leaves from Gopa Chowk and sometimes from Akhe Pol
 iske alaava badlaav ke naam par ek do kaarykram jod die jate hai yaa phir bahari rajyon ke lok kalakaaron ko bulaayaa jaataa he
 Tourist visiting Ajay Yadav said that during the Maru Festival, foreign tourists as well as domestic tourists also come in large numbers
 aise main unhen dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch nae kaarykram jode ja sakate hai
 Rajasthani cultural programs and Kavi Sammelan etc
 can be included
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava aisi pratiyogitaayen yojit kii jaae jisamen sailaani adhik se adhik hissaa le saken
 Competitions should be organized especially among tourists
 jaisalmer nivasee harish chandra ne bataaya ki swarnanagari main yojit hone vaale maru mahotsav main ab tak kabhi bhi sthaan parivartan nahin hua
 The venue is the same
 sam ke dhore, punam stadium va dadansar mela maidan
 There may be events on the equatorial side as well as on the axles
 chandra ke anusaar ek din ke kaarykram sam ke dhoron par to ek din ke kaarykram khuhadi ke dhoron par kiye ja sakate hai
 If there is a cultural evening on the equator, then camel races and other competitions can be organized on the coasts of Khurdi
 unhone suzav diya ki punam stadium main yojit hone vaali do saanskrithik sandhya main ek kaa sthaan badla ja saktaa hai, jisase anya kshetra paryaton ke rup main viksit honge or paryaton maanchitr par ubharenge
 Prithviraj, president of the Tourist Confederation Society, said that to promote tourism, a change in the Maru festival is necessary
 kaarykram badale jaaen or kaarykram sthal bhi
 Once the program site is developed, new areas will be found and they will emerge on the tourism map which will also provide employment to the people there
 unhone kaha ki mahotsav ke kai saalon se chal rahe kaaryakramon main badlaav nahin hone ke kaaran sthaneey logon kii bhagidaari lagaataar kam ho rahi he
 To prevent this, there is a need to change the programs and venue so that local citizens and tourists will have options of programs and places
 unhone kaha ki maru mahotsav ko adhik sthaan par yojit karne se sailaaniyon kii thaharne kii avadhi badhegi or paryaton kshetra ko jabardast laabh milegaa

 The Center said this after the Congress insisted that it should have the first right to form the government
 centre kii taraf se atorni general mukul rohtagi ne court se kaha, 'main raashtrapati shashan waapas liye jane par koi bhi faisla kiye jane se pehle adaalat ko suchit karuunga
 The court was hearing an interim application of former Chief Minister Harish Rawat, in which he feared that President's rule could be lifted to pave the way for the formation of a government led by the BJP in the state

 He said that the court cannot pass any order to stop the political process
 iske alaava is tarah kii maukhik daleelon par vichaar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Singhvi, who argued on the merits of the case challenging the imposition of President's rule in the state, filed an interim application in the evening, seeking to instruct the Governor that if President's rule is withdrawn, first Rawat Should be invited to form the government, not the BJP
 kiya gaya haalia aadesh kaa ullekharohatgi ne ravat kii daleel kaa joardaar virodh karte hue kaha kirajyapal ko yachikaaka pakshakaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa or bijepi yahaan ek paksh nahin he

 ' unhone arunachal pradesh maamle main supreme court ke ek haalia aadesh kaa ullekh kiya, jisamen sheersh adaalat ne rajyapal ko jari notice ko waapas le liya tha
 The next hearing on April 18, he also said that the political process cannot be stopped and moreover the courts have the power to turn the clock back

 The train (number 54703) going from Bathinda in Punjab to Bikaner in Rajasthan is named abohar-jodhpur Express, but it is also known as Cancer Express
 cancer express ek train hi nahin balki un saikadon logon kii jivan rekha bhi he, jo har 20 dinon main bathinda se bikaner ke acharya tulsi cancer santhaan kaa safar tay karti he
 Everyday hundreds of people from all over North India come here for their treatment, but surprisingly most of the patients come from Punjab, the agricultural land of India
 meraa safar bikaner ke acharya tulsi cancer santhaan se shuru hua
 Where i tried to reach some families who have been traveling in Cancer Express
 hospital ke registration offis se kisi tarah bathinda se aane vaale 100 marijon kii list lee
 One by one, the rotating fingers on the keypad of the mobile were dialing the number given in the list
 maine kareeb 90 pariwaron se baat kii, jisamen se 24 parivaar aise the, jo cancer peedit parijan ko kho chuke the, jisamen do saal kaa ek baccha bhi shaamil tha
 Only eight of the remaining families were to come to Bikaner in the next one week
 aath main se teen pariwaron ne hamaare saath cancer express main safar kiya
 With these three families, i am writing parallel my experience and their suffering
 pehla parivaar jasvir cor kaa he
 The 25-year-old woman suffers from a form of cancer, myelo fibrosis
 do chote bacchon kii maa jasvir cor chemotherapy ke liye har 20 din main bikaner jaati hai
 Jasvir Kaur's husband Binder leaves his wages and takes care of Jasvir and two children
 jasvir maanati he ki vah cancer jaisi laa-ilaaj beemaari ko bhi maat de paaegi or jald hi apane bacchon kii dekh-rekh karne lagegi
 In Jasvir's house, the despair blossoms with the killers of two small children
 har 20 din main jasvir apane mata-pita ke saath bikaner jaati he or binder ghar par rahakar bacchon kii dekh-bhaal karata he
 Despite all this, there was no wrinkle on Binder's face
 vah is zimmedaari ko bakhubi nibhaa rahaa he
 After Binder leaves work, Binder's father and brother are looking after the expenses of home-cooked lentils
 jasvir ke ilaaj kaa kharch ghar kii bakrii or bhens bechakar uthaaya jaataa he
 Not being able to take care of children is more painful for Jasvir than cancer
 doosraa parivaar mahinangla gaanv ke geyona singh kaa he
 Family actor Jiona Singh is suffering from cancer of Gaul Blader
 geyona ke teen main se do bete mazaduri karte hai
 The youngest son Chamkor Singh spends more time with his father
 ghar main daakhil hote hi angan main charpai par lete geyona or unke paas baitha chamkor donon ke hi chehre utre hue the
 At the age of having fun with friends, 17-year-old Chamkor was a father figure with a responsibility
 geyona singh mushkil se hi kuch kha pate the
 It was found from nearby families that two more people in the same village had cancer, which is no longer there
 yah baat sunakar andaja lagaaya ja saktaa tha ki akele bathinda main hi cancer ne kis tarah apni jaden failaai hui hai
 Jiona Singh hardly spoke more than two words in our presence
 geyona singh kii khamoshi unki shaareerik pidaa se zyada unki maansik pidaa bayaan kar rahi thi
 Giona became emotional while answering a question, but while handling herself, told me about her illness
 geyona singh ko zyada pareshaan naa karte hue maine cancer express par unke saath safar karne kii ichha zaahir kii to geyona singh ne khamoshi se sir hilaa kar mujhe aamantrit kar liya
 The third family was the family of 35-year-old Gurdeep Singh, who lives in Jusipavali village
 gurdeep singh kaa chota bhai or pita dharmpal singh apni kheti kar ghar kii guzar-basar karte hai
 Gurdeep Singh has cancer of the esophagus, which he has been fighting for the last eight months
 unke pita dharmpal kii umr 65 varsh he, jo ki is umr main bhi ghar kii zimmedaari kaa bhaar apane buudhe kandhon par uthaae hue hai
 At the age in which Gurdeep should take care of his father, at that age Gurdeep is suffering from cancer and his father is serving him
 dharmpal singh har 25 dinon main gurdeep ke saath bikaner jate hai
 This happened the same time
 dharmpal singh kandhon par ek baari bag latakaae plateform par hamen milen
 Giona Singh and Jasvir Kaur also have platform no
 do par apane-apane pariwaron ke saath baithe train kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Dharampal's old eyes were looking at the train with hopeful eyes
 geyona ke bete chamkor ne pita ko sahaara dete hue train me chadha diya
 Jasvir's parents took out a sheet from a plastic bag and spread it on the berth of the train and made Jasvir sit
 raat ke 10 baje the or train kii band khidki kii bachi hui jagah se thandi hawa ne train me baithe logon ko sukadane par majaboor kar diya
 Five o'clock in the morning and three families who were awakened all night, now stared at the station from the window of the train reaching Bikaner
 train nan
 The speed of 54703 stopped at Bikaner station and one by one these three families got down at Bikaner station with sleepy eyes
 abhi subah ke 5:30 baje hai or yah log chaay kii chuskee lekar dow
 Arrived at Beniwal's house
 jahaan hospital kii o
 P
 di me jaanch ke liye number lagaana padataa he
 These three families reached the hospital at eight o'clock in the morning, after the primary formalities, all three patients got their investigations done
 jahaan jasvir cor ko ek or chemotherapy ke liye bheja gaya, vahiin geyona singh ko or do din hospital main rah kar ilaaj karana tha
 Giona Singh's cancer is in the fourth stage where nothing can be done by the doctor except to ease the suffering of the patient
 gurdeep ke liye dow
 Beniwal commented positively and was happy to see Gurdeep's condition improve
 vahiin do bacchon kii maa jasvir cor bhi cancer se apni jang main safalataa kii kagaar par he
 Dr
 beniwal ne punjab main cancer ki vajah kheton main atyaadhik kitnashkon ke prayog or pani main ghulansheel rasayanon ko bhi mana he
 Every day 18 people die due to cancer in Punjab
 yah aankade chaunkaane vaale hai or yaqinan daraane vaale bhi hai
 We still have the last chance to beat cancer
 mauka bhunaanaa hoga or jeetna hoga
 The CBI has busted the human trafficking gang and registered a case against five of its members for attempting to send 11 teenagers from Punjab to the US based on fake documents

 unhone kishor ladakon ke parivaar se lakhon rupee liye the
 The matter is being investigated

 The corridors of power in the state have got a fresh air of development which was once trapped in the grip of misrule and casteism in such a way that it has spread the traditions and land service of the people of Haryana (including the defense services to the Indian security forces Haryanvi is the largest number) had distorted the original image of the dedicated working people

 The success of Khattar's 15-day 3,000-km Jan Aashirwad Yatra, which passed through all 90 seats in the Haryana Assembly and ended in early September, is indicative of how the atmosphere is currently seen in Khattar's favor

 The deployment of teachers had taken the form of an industry in the previous reign and a teacher had to spend between Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 for a posting of his choice or find a strong political connection

 Another very popular line is "ab Ki Baar 75 Paar"

 Khattar, a former RSS pracharak and who worked with Modi, has come out of the phase when violence erupted after the riots in the state demanding Jat reservation and the arrest of self-styled Guru Ram Rahim Singh He was accused of being an unskilled administrator for the shootings and violence that killed about 40 people
 us samay khatter kii chhavi ek aise vyakti kii bani thi jo kathin paristhitiyon se nipatane main asamarth tha
 An official report of the Center also said that Khattar was able to deal firmly with the situation in both the cases
 khatter kaa kahana he ki donon dange jaan-boojhkar aise tatwon ne kiye the jo unki sarkaar ko asthir karnaa chaahate the
 One of the major steps that changed his image of a soft-tempered man who was not able to deal with difficult situations was the action of vigorously tackling the power thieves in the agricultural sector
 haryana bijli kii chori ke liye kukhyat tha, jahaan kisaan bijli ke taron ko mukhya bijli linon se avaidh rup se jodakar bijli churaate the
 Apart from punishing the power thieves, the Chief Minister came up with a plan to provide 24-hour power supply in those villages where the electricity theft was completely stopped
 ek samay tha jab haryana kaa ek bhi gaanv aisa nahin tha jahaan bijli kii chori nahin hoti thi, ab haryana ke kul 6200 gaanvon main se 4200 gaanvon main 'meraa gaanv, jagamag gaanv' naamak yojana ke tahat 24 ghante bijli kii aapurti ho rahi he, kyonki in gaanvon ke bashindon ne bijli chori puri tarah se band kar di he
 However, Khattar, like many other accomplished BJP leaders, revealed his weak side when in view of the recent elections he waived interest on loans of 10,000 farmers, putting a burden of Rs 4700 crore on the government exchequer
 haalanki, mukhyamantri yah kehete hai ki byaaj ke ye paise kabhi nahin milane vaale the kyonki kisaan bhugtan karne kii sthiti main nahin hai or yah nuksaan bahut thodaa he
 "these are real farmers who were in dire need to get out of the vicious cycle of debt," he says

 court ne yahaan tak kah diya ki agar salmaan ko yah chhot di gai to koi bhi sajayaftaa court main aa jayega
