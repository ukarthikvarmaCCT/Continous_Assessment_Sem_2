 a post shared by Shikhar Dhawan (@shikhardofficial) on Nov 20, 2017 at 5:45am PST Corruption has come down in the state after Bihar Chief Minister and JDU leader Nitish Kumar parted ways with the rjd-congress
 india today-exis maai india survey capolitical stock exange(pse) main iskaa khulaasa hua he
 At the same time, Nitish Kumar still remains the first choice of the people of Bihar for the post of Chief Minister
 is survey main jab pratibhaagiyon se sawaal poocha gaya ki kya nitish kumaar ke argedy-congress se alag hone ke baad rajya main bhrashtachar kii sthiti par fark padaa, to survey ke 49 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne kaha ki bihar main bhrashtachar main kami ai he
 Although 40 percent of the voters believe that there is no reduction in corruption, 11 percent of the participants could not express any clear opinion on this question
 dilachasp ye he ki nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saath naata todakar saal 2015 main lalu prasad yadav kerashtriya janata dal (rjd)or congress ke saath mahagathbandhan banaakar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha
 The Mahagathbandhan had defeated the BJP in this election, but Nitish Kumar could not stay in the Grand Alliance for long
 argedy ke saath matbhedon ke chalate unhone kaarykaal ke bich main hi istipha de diya or phir bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar bana lee
 According to PSE findings, 38 per cent of the participants in the survey appeared satisfied with the functioning of the Nitish government
 vahiin, 34 pratishat ne sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par nakhushi jataai or 24 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne ise ausat bataaya
 The India today-axis My India survey is based on interviews conducted in 40 parliamentary constituencies in the state
 is survey main kul 15,375 pratibhaagiyon ne hissaa liya
 The survey was conducted from 22 to 26 September
 PSE ke mutabik jab bihar ke ahm muddon ke bare main pratibhaagiyon se poocha gaya to unhone sabase bade mudde ke taur par ‘naalee-naale or saaf-safai’ kaa naam liya
 After this, the participants counted unemployment, drinking water, problems of farmers and inflation as other important issues
 maaloom ho ki 243 sadasyeey bihar vidhansabha ke liye 2015 main hue chunaav main JDU ko 71 siton par kamyaabi mili thi
 In this election, RJD won 80 seats, BJP 53 and Congress 27 seats
 CM pad ke liye logon kii pehali pasand nitisharajnneetik nabz par nazar rakhane vaale desh ke pehle saptahik kaarykram PSE ke mutabiknithish kumarabihar main mukhyamantri ke liye logon kii pehali pasand bane hue hai
 46% percent of the participants in the poll survey voted for Nitish Kumar

 jaadu-tona ke naam par farji daawa karne vaale baabaaon kaa sach camere main kaid ho gaya
 These fake Baba claim that on the power of black magic, from vashikaran and hypnosis can make boys and girls crazy in love
 jaahir taur par samaaj ke har varg main aise baba jame hue hai, jo logon ko thagne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Aajtak's camera captured the black truth of fake babas
 sach saamne aayaa to ye baba aise bhaage, jaise peeche bhoot pad gaya ho
 These Baba's boxes boast of everything from the girl of choice to uncountable wealth
 darasal, ajtak kii team ko khabar mili ki dilli-ensiaar samet deshbhar main faile farji baabaaon ke jaal main funskar saikadon log thage ja chuke hai
 Some people also gave Baba's addresses and whereabouts and Baba himself did the rest
 akhabaaron main naammumkin chizon ko chutki main mumkin kar dikhaane ke bade-bade daavon ke ishtihaar aapane bhi dekhe honge
 The first team reached Aaj Tak, Mohan Nagar in Ghaziabad
 mohan nagar bas stand ke ek chote se shopping complex kii pehali manzil par baba kii thagi kii dukaan saji hui thi
 When the team reached the whereabouts of this person who described himself as Baba and Guru Aman in newspapers, there was a panic
 kathith baba ke chelon ne camera dekhte hi bhaagane kii koshish kii
 One of them was stopped and asked to introduce Baba, but the disciple shivered
 baba aman kaa chela bhaag gaya, lekin baba abhi andar hi the
 In this way Baba Aman, who claims to relieve every difficulty of the people in a moment, came out of his room
 baba se poocha gaya ki vah kaise kisi ko vash main karte hai
 On this, Baba considered it to be more urgent without seeing anything
 vah railing phaand faraar ho gaya
 What was the basis of the sting? In Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad, a man named Baba Aman claimed on the phone to our team that he would drive the girl he loved into our love
 iske baad hamaari team uske thikaane par pahunchi or jab ham vahaan pahunche to baba kii ek-ek pole khul gai or uskaa har farjivada khufia camere main kaid ho gaya
 When the team approached Baba and started questioning, Baba suspected that his recording was being done
 baba aman fouran fees jamaa karne kii baat karne laga or reporter se mobile maangana shuru kiya
 When Baba reversed the mobile, he was convinced that there was no threat to his racket
 ab baba ne poocha ki kis ladki ko vash main karnaa chaahate ho
 In the meantime, an attempt was made to know how Baba finally convinces people to solve their problems by getting into the trap of their own fraud
 lekin sawaal jawaab zyada hota dekh bab aman bhaanp gaya or vahaan se faraar ho gaya

 On November 8, the implementation of demonetisation is going to complete one year
 jaise-jaise ye taarikh najadik aa rahi he, is mudde par siyasat bhi tej hoti ja rahi he
 Opposition parties, including the Congress, are calling demonetisation as MMD (modi-made disaster)

 Along with demonetisation, a new note of 2000 rupees was also added to the economy of the country
 beete ek saal main aise kayaas lagaae jate rahe hai ki 2000 rupee kaa note lambey samay tak prachlan main nahin rahegaa
 Just a month after the introduction of the 2000 rupee note, in December 2016, RSS ideologue S
 Gurumurthy's statement came that those who want to hoard 2000 rupee notes, think twice first because these notes will last more days
 Is not going to remain in vogue till now
 july, 2017 main ‘economic times’main prakashit report main kaha gaya tha ki rigerv bank of india (RBI) kii ore se 2000 rupee ke noton kii aapurti nahin kiye jane se aisi atakalon ko bal mila he ki sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat2000 rupee ke notonki aapurti simit kii ja rahi he
 Livemint also said in a report at the same time that the RBI has stopped printing 2000 rupee notes and will not be printed any more in the current financial year
 2000 rupee ke notonko lekar sarkaar kii ore se bhi samay samay par bayaan aate rahe hai
 In April this year, the government had told the Rajya Sabha that there was no plan for demonetisation of 2000 rupee notes
 agast main vitt mantri arun jetali se jab sawaal kiya gaya ki kya sarkaar2000 rupee ke notonko charanbaddh dhang se prachlan se baahar karne par vichaar kar rahi he, to unhone kaha, ‘nahin, aisa koi vichaar nahin chal rahaa
 In the midst of apprehensions of the Rs 2000 note and the frequent denials by the government, an attempt was made to formally ascertain the status of the RTI route
 india today network ke RTI cell or research department ke head ke naate rigerv bank of india se soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat2000 rupee ke notepar jaankaree maangi gai
 The answer came from the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL), a wholly owned company of the Government of India
 is company kii ore se karansi noton ko chhapane ke saath sikkon ko bhi dhaala jaataa he
 The reply received by SPMCIL stated that no demand has been sent by RBI to SPMCIL for printing currency notes of 2000 rupees
 isamen aage kaha gaya he ki maujuuda samay main SPMCIL sirf 500 rupye ke note (nae) or isse kam mulya ke note print kar rahi he( lekin 5 rupye or 2 rupye ke note nahin)
 SPMCIL, the government's nodal unit for printing currency notes, is not currently printing Rs 2000 notes
 karansi or noton kaa niyaman karne vaale RBI ne2000 rupye ke note princenheen karne ke liye kaha he
 The reply of SPMCIL did not clarify whether printing of 2000 rupee notes is temporary or permanent
 haalanki ye sawaal jehan main aata he ki agar2000 rupye ke noton ko print karanaband kar diya gaya he or isse chote mulya ke noton ko zyada cirkulation main laayaa ja rahaa he to aisi surat main 2000 rupye ke note charanbaddh dhang se prachlan se baahar ho sakate hai
 However, the answer received from RTI does not remove the doubt that the age of the largest denomination of 2000 rupee note is haalanki bhaashan ke shuruyaat main pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki pichley kuch samay main nitish kumaar or susheel modi ne acha kaam kiya he

 This year's storm has been named 'phani Cyclone'
 vahiin, pichley saal 2018 main bengal kii khadi se chale tufaan ko 'titali' naam diya gaya tha
 It was given the name 'titli' by Pakistan
 yahaan jaaniye aakhir is baar is tufaan kaa 'phani' (fani Cyclone)naam kaise padaa
 All these eight countries have given the list of names of storms to the World Meteorological Organization
 isamen bharat ne 'agni', 'bijli', 'megh', 'sagar' or 'akaash' jaise naam die
 At the same time, Pakistan gave names like 'nilofar', 'bulbul' and 'titli'
 inhen naamon main se world metrological organijeshan tufaan kaa naam rakhti he
 If a cyclone occurs in these eight countries, one name is chosen in turn among the sent names
 bharat main 10 saal tak ek naam dobaaraa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
 Also, the names of cyclones that cause more havoc are discarded
 is baar bangladesh ke suzav par tufaan kaa naam 'phani' rakhaa gaya he
 At the same time, the US lists 21 names of storms every year
 haalanki angreji ke har alfabet se ek naam rakhaa jaataa he
 But Q, U, X, y and z are not a tradition to name storms from alphabet
 agar ek saal main 21 se zyada tufaan aaen to phir unka naam greek alphabet alpha, beta, gamma ke naam se rakh diya jaataa he
 The formula of aud-even is adopted in these names
 jaise od saalon main chakravaat kaa naam auraton ke naam par rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki evan saalon main aae tufaan ke naam purushon par aadhaarit hote hai
 That is to say, aud years such as the storms in 2019, 2021 and 2023 will be named after women
 vahiin evan saal jaise ki 2018, 2020 or 2022 main aane vaale tufaanon ke naam purushon ke naam par aadhaarit honge

 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhaa he
 In this letter, he has mentioned the eight-month-old girl who is currently battling between life and death in Delhi's AIIMS Hospital
 unhone likhaa
 
 
 Mr
 Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, Government of India, Honorable Prime Minister, i would like to draw your attention to an 8-month-old daughter of Delhi
 yah nanhee si jaan is vakt dilli ke ames aspataal main tadap rahi he
 He is brutally raped by a 27-year-old man
 bacchee kaa 3 ghante tak oparation chalaa he or uski haalat najuk he
 i have met the girl many times in the last 4 days and i cannot tell what i am feeling
 sar us bacchee kii chikhon se puraa aspataal gunja he
 His eyes and sobs are not going through my mind
 kal phir ek 6 saal kii bacchee ke saath balaatkaar hua
 He suffered inhuman injuries, which spread the infection throughout the body and he died
 yah sach he ki nanhee pari kaa nahin balki meraa balaatkaar hua he
 i have written many letters to you in the last 2 years, being the chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission and the daughter of Delhi
 par mujhe dukh he ki mere ek bhi patr par aapane jawaab dena bhi thik nahin samajha
 Sir, you are my Prime Minister, i am very much looking forward to you like the whole country
 is choti si bacchee or aisi lakhon bacchiyon ko bachaane kii jimmedaari aapke kandhon par he
 i hope to cooperate with you for this
 aaj desh main bacchon ke saath balaatkaar kii vaaradaaten isliye bad rahi hai kyonki aparaadhiyon ko aparaadh karne se dar nahin lagata
 They feel that they will do anything with any woman and child and this impotent system will not do anything to them
 unke hausale isliye buland hai kyonki hamaare desh main nyaay paane kii ladaai bahut kathin he
 Delhi Police told us that between 2012 and 2014 crime cases against 31,446 women were registered in Delhi and convictions in less than 150 cases
 aap hi bataaie, agar sajaaen nahin hongi to aparaadh karne se kise dar lagegaa? aaj sachai yah he ki dilli, desh kii rajdhani main aam log dare rahete hai or apradhi majboot hai
 Most sadly, our system is unable to punish the culprits
 is charmarati hui vyavastha ko badalanaa hi hoga
 i was saddened to learn yesterday that in the case of the 8-month-old girl, the Hon'ble Supreme Court lawyer in the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that conviction-in-death is not necessary in the case of rape of young girls
 yah sahi nahin he
 If the rapist of an 8-month-old girl will not be given a severe punishment, then tell how will the rape stop in the country? We have to create a system in which at least the convicts of rape of young girls are punished in every condition within 6 months- A
 Death be given
 isse aparaadhiyon ke man main bhay baithegaa
 Today's situation is that even Nirbhaya did not get justice in the country
 aaj bhi uske kaatil jinda he
 This bad system has to be changed
 iske liye aapse guzarish he ki aap is maamle main sangyaan le or hamaari madad karen
 Establish such a system in the country, in which, immediately and immediately, rapists of young girls are punished
 iske liye aapako neeche likhi hui binduon par jald nirnaayak kadam uthaane chahie
 
 
 1
 ek aisa kathor kanoon banaaen jisase har haal main chote bacchon ke balaatkaariyon ko 6 maheene main sajaa-e-maut di jaae
 2
 dilli police pichley 10 saal se centre sarkaar se 66,000 hajaar pulicekarmi maang rahi he
 Till date, the central government has not given a single policeman
 natijan dilli police VIP duty to kar paa rahi he lekin janata kii duty karne main kamjor sabit ho rahi he
 Every police station is currently working at half its assigned staff
 bataaie vah dilli kii janata ko kaise surakshit kar paaenge? turant dilli police ko 66,000 pulicekarmi die jaaen
 3
 mujhe dukh hota he aapako bataate hue ki centre sarkaar pichley 10 saalon se deshbhar kii police kii kaaryastylee kaa digitalykaran karne kii koshish kar rahi he par ab tak vah ek shashakt software banane main asamarth rahi he jisaki vajah se police kii javabdehi tay kar paanaa kathin hota he
 a powerful software should be created for digitizing Delhi Police immediately
 4
 You are aware of the acute shortage of courts and judges across the country
 hamen dilli main itane court banane padenge kii tej gati se bacchon ke balaatkaar ke maamalon main daily tryles ho
 Today's situation is that the long dates of the court breaks the morale of the girls suffering
 5
 Also, the functioning of the Forensic Laboratory and Prosecution Department needs to be strengthened
 bahut baar logon ko kehete sunati hum ki hamaare desh main balaatkaar isliye ho rahe hai kyonki hamaari maansikta hi kharaab he
 These things are very piercing
 hamaara desh vir or viranganaon kaa desh he
 It is a country of warriors like Shivaji and Rani Laxmibai
 hamaari samskruti main hameshaa se mahilaon kii puja hoti ai he
 Then how can we put the incidents of abusive rape on our minds? Today, the main reason for the increasing rapes is that the criminals are fearless
 aapse guzarish karti hum ki ham sab milakar aisa bharat banaayen jisamen agar kisi bacchee ke saath balaatkaar karne kii koi soche bhi, to uski ruh kaanp jaae
 Sir, in the last two years we have tried a lot of work
 jo mahila ayog ek samay apni chuppi or niskriyata ke liye badnaam hua karata tha, aaj kadi mehnat or tapasya se ham use is mukaam par lekar aae hai ki har din kai sau mahilaon kii madad karte hai
 Within 1 year, we have heard 12,000 cases, heard three and a quarter million calls on our helpline, visited 7500 ground visits, helped 5500 court cases for sexually abused women and girls, conducted 1869 counseling sessions and gave more than 55 suggestions to governments
 
 garv ke saath kahana chaahati hum ki dilli mahila ayog desh kaa iklauta ayog he jiskaa daftar shanivaar ko bhi khulata he
 We are working hard day and night
 par itnaa sab kuch karne ke baavjood hamaara kaam tab tak adhuraa he, jab tak sarkaar hamaara saath nahin degi
 So i am doing a 30-day Satyagraha
 aaj mere satyagrah kaa chauthaa din he
 i will not go to my house for full 30 days
 puraa din offis main kaam karne ke baad raat main alag-alag jagahon par jaakar nirikshan karuungi or doguna kaam karuungi
 Will sleep in the office itself
 yah satyagrah main hamaari soi hue vyavastha ko jagaane ke liye kar rahi hum
 i look forward to your support for my Satyagraha
 main chaahati hum ki aap 8 maheene kii bacchee se milen or turant ek ucch stareey samiti kii meeting bulaaen jisamen kendriya grih mantri, dilli ke uparajyapal, dilli ke mukhyamantri, dilli ke police ayukta or dilli mahila ayog shaamil hon
 You are requested to jointly take decisive steps to create a strict system against rapists in the country during my Satyagraha within the next 30 days

 2009 main final khel chuki royal chalangers bangalore or maujuuda upavijeta mumbai indiens tiimon ke bich indian premier lig ke chauthe sanskaran kaa doosraa kwalifire muqabla shuukravaar ko em
 a
 chidambaram stadium main khelaa jayega
 Royal Challengers will present their challenge for the second time for the final after losing to Chennai Super Kings in the first qualifier while Mumbai Indians have reached here with a thrilling win over Kolkata Knight Riders in the only eliminator match
 lig str par royal chalangers ne beshak mumbai indiens se behatar pradarshan kiya tha lekin super kings ke haathon pehla klavifaire muqabla harkar vah is badhat ko ganvaa chuki he
 On the other hand, due to the manner in which the Mumbai Indians defeated the Knight Riders in the drawn match till the last over, now their pan is starting to look heavy
 kaha jaataa he ki cricket main kuch bhi ho saktaa he or iskaa twanti-20 swaroop to hamaare saamne asambhaavnaaon kii paraakaashtha pesh karata he
 In this context, to say who wins at Chidambaram Stadium on Friday will be meaningless
 super kings ne antim over tak khinche mukaable main royal chalangers ko haraaya tha
 It is another matter that the bowlers of Royal Challengers could not face the challenge of 175 runs
 mumbai indiens ne bhi antim over main jeet hasil kii thi
 The good thing with him is that his bowlers included the Knight Riders on a relatively low score
 is lihaaj se shuukravaar ko royal chalangers ko jahaan apni gendbaaji main sudhaar laana hoga vahiin mumbai indiens ke gendbaajon ko apana maujuga farm barkaraar rakhana hoga
 The challenge of Royal Challengers will mainly depend on Chris Gayle, while the challenge of Mumbai Indians will depend on bowlers like Lasith Malinga and Munaf Patel
 ballebaajon main donon tiimon ke paas gaharaai he lekin gendbaaji main mumbai indiens kaa palada baari he
 In such a situation, Mumbai Indians bowlers would like to destroy the strategy of Royal Challengers by taking Gayle's wicket first
 gail ko out karne ke liye mumbai indiens ko usee ranneeti par chalanaa hoga, jiske tahat super kings ne unhen saste main niptaya tha
 Sachin Tendulkar has to remember that Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said before the match that his team's entire strategy may be out to get Gayle out but if he does not succeed then Gayle will dismiss his team
 isi soch ke saath sachin kii team ko bhi maidan main utarana hoga
 Mumbai Indians, once the runners-up in 2010, will once again make it to the finals, while Royal Challengers will face the Super Kings in the finals, repeating the success of 2009
 2009 main royal chalangers ko deccan chargers ke haathon haar mili thi jabaki 2010 main mumbai indiens ko super kings ne haraaya tha

 officiala post shared bykatrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) onmay 30, 2019 at 3:49 am PDT When Salman's turn came, he did not seem much interested in this question
 pehle to unhone mazaakia andaaj main kaha main ai me or maai self ke saath dinar karne ko lekar zyada comfortable feel karuunga
 i like to have dinner with my family at home, more than going out for dinner
 salmaan is sawaal kaa jawaab sidhi tarah se nahin de rahe the
 Katrina swung the question
 magar phir bhi salmaan ne jawaab nahin diya
 Finally, Salman was asked which of the three people he would like to meet
 iskaa bhi jawaab salmaan dene se bachate hue najar aae or unhone kaha agar wo mujhase naa milanaa chahen to
 Let us know that apart from Katrina, Salman Khan was also seen promoting the film along with his father Salim Khan
 intervyuu ke dauraan salmaan se industry main itane lambey vakt tak tike rahane ke bare main sawaal kiye
 Salman said in response - Earlier it was very difficult to enter the industry

 jaiprakash narayan (jepi) kii karmbhumi bihar ko desh kii siyaasi prayogshaala aise hi nahin kaha jaataa
 Political discussion is common in Bihar, from tea shops to home thresholds
 is baar jab desh loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main utar chukaa he to bihar phir siyasat kii ek alag tasviir pesh kar rahaa he
 The streak of NDA vs Mahagathbandhan has clearly emerged in Bihar, it is hardly seen in any other state of the country
 yahaan tak ki desh ke sabase bade rajya upi main bhi trikoniya muqabla he jabaki bihar main is baar muqabla dwipaksheeya or aamane-saamne kaa hone ja rahaa he
 This time the direct competition is NDA vs Grand Alliance
 2019 chunaav ke liye rajya ke tamaam dal donon main se kisi na kisi kheme main shaamil ho chuke hai
 While the NDA comprises BJP, Nitish Kumar's JDU and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP, the RJD in the Grand Alliance, the Congress's Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP, Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hum and Mukesh Sahni's VIP Party have come together
 rajya kii siyasat main aamane-saamne ke mukaable vaali aisi tasviir 15 saal baad dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Earlier in 2004, there was such a contest
 15 saal pehle sidhe mukaable main kisi rahi thi tasviir?isse pehle 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main sidhe mukaable kii sthiti bani thi
 When the RJD, Congress, LJP, NCP and CPM joined hands to challenge the Atal government at the Center
 mukaable ke liye bijepi or jediu kaa gathbandhan saamne tha
 Then Lalu Prasad Yadav's party RJD got 22 seats, Congress 3 and LJP 4 seats
 is gathbandhan ko bihar kii 40 main se 29 siton par jeet mili thi
 While 43
 35 pratishat vot share
 On the other hand BJP-JDU had got 11 seats and vote share 36
 93 fisadi tha
 In 2009, the politics changes and the game also changes in the politics of Badlabihar, then the mathematics of votes also changes
 2009 ke chunaav main nitish kumaar to endie ke paale main rahe lekin congress or argedy main baat nahin bani
 Then Lalu Prasad's RJD and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP came together and the Congress alone
 is chunaav main bijepi-jediu ko 32 siten mili thim
 While vote share 37
 97 fisadi rahaa tha
 RJD got 4 seats and 19
 30 pratishat vot
 LJP could not even open an account
 jabaki akele chunaav main utari congress 2 seat hi jeet saki
 10 to Congress
 26 fisadi vot mili
 Two seats went to the account of others
 2014 main bikharaav kaa phayda bhaajapa ko mila2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bihar kii siyaasi tasviir ekadam alag thi
 When BJP came riding on the Modi wave, Nitish Kumar's JDU was in a separate field, leaving the NDA against Modi
 jabaki argedy or congress saath kadamtal kar rahe the
 The NDA won 31 of the 40 seats in Bihar due to the Modi wave
 bijepi ko 22, ramvilas paswan kii lojpa ko 6, araspi ko 3 siten milin
 JDU got just 2 seats
 vahiin argedy ko 4 or congress ko 2 or ensipi ko bas 1 seat par jeet hasil hui
 In 2014, NDA got 38 votes
 8 fisadi or nitish kumaar kii party jediu ko 15
 Got 80 percent of the vote
 jabaki rashtriya janata dal ko 6
 4 per cent, 1 to NCP
 2 fisadi or congress ko 8
 4 percent votes were received
 koun kitne pani main?is baar yani 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ladaai sidhi he
 The NDA and the Grand Alliance are face to face
 ek taraf narendra modi or nitish kumaar kii jodi kaa kamaal dekhnaa he to duusari ore rahul gandhi kii aguwai vaali congress or tejasvi yadav kii aguwai vaale argedy ke mahagathbandhan se muqabla he
 For the first time, Lalu Yadav is out of the political picture of Bihar and is serving a sentence in the fodder scam case in Ranchi
 lekin, ranchi ke rems aspataal se hi ve mahagathbandhan ke liye ranneeti banane or siyaasi gotiyaan set karne main bete tejasvi ke liye parde ke peeche se chanakya kii bhoomika main hai
 Who is heavy in the battle of issues? Lok Sabha elections are held on national issues, but in Bihar, regional factors are also less effective
 endie jahaan modi-nitish ke chehre, vikaas ke kaam, airstrike se upji rashtrawaad kii bhaavana or vipaksh ke kaal main hue ghotaalon ko mudda bana rahaa he to vahiin mahagathbandhan nitish sarkaar main bade aparaadh, srijan ghotaalaa, daliton or muslimon ke mudde, rahul-tejasvi ke yuva agenda ke bharose jeet kii ummid lagaae hue he
 Know, where is the election in the 40 Lok Sabha seats of Bihar - First phase - April 11 - Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada and Jamui
 doosraa charan- 18 april- kishanganj, katihaar, purniya, bhagalpur or baankaa

 This is Argentina's third consecutive win in their group and topped it with nine points
 nigeria ko bhale hi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin group 'epa' ke ek anya match main bosnia-harjegovina kii iran par 3-1 se jeet ke kaaran africa team antim 16 main jagah banane main safal rahi
 Nigeria scored four points in three matches
 bosnia pehle hi baahar ho chukaa tha, lekin usne iran kii ummiido par pani pher diya
 Messi, who had been the hero of Argentina's victory in the last two matches, again showed his brilliance, but today he got an equal fight with Ahmed Musa of Nigeria
 argentini captain ne match ke tisare or pehle half ke injuri time main gol daage
 Rojo scored the third and deciding goal for Argentina in the 50th minute

 Even before the spectators could get into the match, Messi thrilled him by presenting a magical piece of his skills, but the very next moment Moses too showed that he was no less
 iske baad bhi stadium main mesi kaa naam hi goonjata rahaa, jinhone pichley match main iran ke khilaaf aakhri kshanon main gol karke apni team ko pehle hi nokout main pahunchaa diya tha
 Nigeria immediately retaliated and benefited from it

 He entered the Argentine penalty area with him and then managed to bowl the ball, thwarting all efforts from goalkeeper Sergio Romero
 chaar minute ke andar score 1-1 se baraabar tha

 In this meeting chaired by Bhupendra Yadav, the possibilities of holding the assembly and Lok Sabha elections together were discussed
 darasal, chunaavon par badhate kharch or kaamkaaj prabhavit hone ke kaaran is baat par lambey samay se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he ki kyon naa vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav ko ek saath kara diya jaae
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has stressed many times that both elections should be held simultaneously in the interest of the country and to save time and money
 baithak main sansadeey sthai samiti ko kanoon mantralay ke pratinidhiyon ne bataaya ki vidhansabha orloksabhaa chunaavonko ek saath karana philhal sambhav nahin he

 While elections will be held in many states 6 to 8 months before the 2019 general elections
 jaise ki meghalaya, nagaland or tripura vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal march 2018 main khatm ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, elections can be held here in february-march
 vahiin karnataka vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal saal 2018 ke may main khatm ho rahaa he
 Hence, elections can also be held here during april-may
 jabaki bijepi shasit rajasthan vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 2019 janvari main khatm hoga
 The tenure of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly will also end at this time
 baharhaal, badastoor in teenon rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ek saath hi honge
 The assembly elections in the states of Jharkhand and Haryana will be held six months after the 2019 general elections
 kul milakar dekha jaae to loksabhaa chunaav ke aas-paas kai vidhansabha chunaav hote hai
 In such a situation, if all these elections are conducted at one time and together, it will not only save the cost of the country, but many of the work that was stalled during the bulk elections can be saved from being affected

" ’ unhone 26 farvari ko kaha tha, ‘main shakha, echoged or diopi se asahmat hum
 Since i do not agree with the dop, in all three rcs, they should be sent to the Solicitor General to get an opinion on the legal issues raised in the petitions
 ’bihar ke purv mukhyamantri lalu prasad ko chaara ghotaale se sambandhit maamalon main se ek maamle main pehle hi doshi tehraaya ja chukaa he

 ek vigyaapan main mahendra singh dhoni ek aisi jersey pahane hue nazar aate hai, jis par unki maa devaki kaa naam likhaa he
 When the reporter questions the reason behind this, Dhoni replies, "I was wearing my father's name jersey for so many years, then you never asked, no specific reason

 To please Baba Bholenath, you are also fasting on Monday, so complete this fast by reading or listening to the story of Shiva fasting
 
 
 somvaar vrath kii vidhi:naarad puraana ke anusaar somvaar vrath main vyakti ko praatah snaan karke shiv ji ko jal orbel patr chadhaanachahie tathaa shiv-gauri kii puja kerani chahie
 The story of Monday fast should be heard after Shiva worship
 iske baad keval ek samay hi bhojan karnaa chahie
 Normally, Monday fast is till the third hour of the day
 matlab shaam tak rakhaa jaataa he
 There are three types of Monday fasts, one per Monday fast, the mild Pradosh fast and sixteen Monday fast
 in sabhi vraton ke liye ek hi vidhi hoti he
 Vrat Katha: Once upon a time, a moneylender lived in a city
 uske ghar main dhan kii koi kami nahin thi lekin uski koi santan nahin thi is kaaran vah bahut dukhi tha
 He had a fast every Monday to get a son and worshiped Lord Shiva and Parvati Ji with full devotion
 uski bhakthi dekhakar ek din maa parvati prasann ho gayi or bhagwaan shiv se us sahuukaar kii manokamana purna karne kaa aagrah kiya
 Hearing the wishes of Parvati ji, Lord Shiva said, 'O Parvati, every creature in this world gets the fruits of his deeds and whose fate he has to suffer
 ' lekin parvati ji ne sahuukaar kii bhakthi kaa maan rakhane ke liye uski manokamana purna karne kii ichha jataai
 On the request of Mata Parvati, Shivji gave a boon to the moneylender but he also said that his child will be only twelve years old
 mata parvati or bhagwaan shiv kii baatcheet ko sahuukaar sun rahaa tha
 He was neither happy nor sad about this
 vah pehle kii bhaanti shivaji kii puja karata rahaa
 After some time a son was born to the moneylender
 jab vah balak gyaarah varsh kaa hua to use padhane ke liye kaashi bhej diya gaya
 The moneylender called the maternal uncle of the son and gave him a lot of money and said that you take this child to attain Kashi Vidya and perform Yajna on the way
 jahaan bhi yajna karaao vahaan brahmanon ko bhojan karaate or dakshina dete hue janaa
 Both uncles and nephews would perform yajna in the same way and donate dakshina to Brahmins and went towards Kashi
 raat main ek nagar padaa jahaan nagar ke raja kii kanya kaa vivaah tha
 But the prince he was about to marry was Kana with one eye
 rajkumaar ke pita ne apane putr ke kaana hone kii baat ko chupaane ke liye ek chaal sochi
 Seeing the moneylender's son, a thought came to his mind
 usne sochaa kyon na is ladke ko duulhaa banaakar rajkumaari se vivaah kara duun
 After marriage, i will give it away and will take the princess to her city
 ladke ko duulhe ke vastra pahanaakar rajkumaari se vivaah kar diya gaya
 But the moneylender's son was honest
 use yah baat nyaaysangat nahin lagi
 He took the opportunity and wrote on the foot of the princess's sardine, 'you are married to me, but the prince with whom you will be sent is Kana with one eye
 main to kaashi padhane ja rahaa hum
 'when the princess read the words written on the chunni, she told her parents this
 raja ne apni putree ko vidaa nahin kiya jisase baraat waapas chali gai
 On the other hand, the moneylender's boy and his maternal uncle reached Kashi and went there and performed a yagna
 jis din ladke kii aayu 12 saal kii hui usee din yajna rakhaa gaya
 The boy told his maternal uncle that my health is not right
 mamaa ne kaha ki tum andar jaakar so jaao
 According to Shiva's boon, the child's life came out in a while
 mrit bhaanje ko dekh uske mamaa ne vilaap shuru kiya
 Incidentally at the same time, Shiva and Mata Parvati were going from there
 parvati ne bhagwaan se kaha- swami, mujhe iske rone ke swar sahan nahin ho rahaa
 You must remove this person's suffering
 jab shivaji mrit balak ke sameep gaye to vah bole ki yah usee sahuukaar kaa putr he, jise maine 12 varsh kii aayu kaa vardaan diya
 Now its age is over
 lekin matra bhav se vibhor mata parvati ne kaha ki he mahadev, aap is balak ko or aayu dene kii krupa karen anyathaa iske viyog main iske mata-pita bhi tadap-tadap kar mar jaaenge
 At the insistence of Mata Parvati, Lord Shiva granted the boy the boon of being alive
 shivaji kii krupa se vah ladkaa jivit ho gaya
 After finishing education, the boy went to his city with maternal uncle
 donon chalate hue usee nagar main pahunche, jahaan uskaa vivaah hua tha
 He also performed a yajna in that city
 us ladke ke sasur ne use pahchaan liya or mahal main le jaakar uski khatirdaari kii or apni putree ko vidaa kiya
 Here the moneylender and his wife were hungry and thirsty waiting for their son
 unhone pran kar rakhaa tha ki yadi unhen apane bete kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to vah bhi praan tyaag denge parantu apane bete ke jivit hone kaa samachar paakar vah behad prasann hue
 The same night, Lord Shiva came in the dream of the merchant and said - o superior, i have given a long life to your son, pleased with your Monday fast and listening to the story
 isi prakaar jo koi somvaar vrath karata he yaa katha sunata or padhata he uske sabhi dukh dur hote hai or samast manokamanaayen purna hoti hai

 america main trump prashasan or media ke bich vivaad dinondin gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Now US news channel CNN has filed a case against US President Donald Trump and top White House officials against the ban on its journalist Jim Acosta
 yah cese washington sthit US district court main daakhil kiya gaya he
 CNN has filed a case against Trump and his colleagues, demanding immediate removal of the ban on its chief White House correspondent, Jim Acostapar
 bataa den ki pichley saptaah vout house ne donald trump se bahes ke baad patrkaar acosta kaa press paas nilambit kar diya tha
 In a case filed against the CNN Nedonald Trump administration on Tuesday, the White House alleged that the reporter violated the press rights of reporter Jim Acosta after arguing with US President Donald Trump and violated the rights granted to the journalist under the Constitution
 CNN ne cese kii ghoshnaa karte hue ek bayaan main kaha, 'in dastavejon ko galat tareeke se radd karnaa press kii swatantraaa ke sienen or acosta ke pratham sanshodhan adhikaar or niyat prakriya ke paanchaven sanshodhan adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 "we have appealed to the court to immediately stop this White House order and return Jim Acosta's press pass," CNN said in the statement
 ham is prakriya ke tahat sthaayee raahat maangenge
 If not challenged, the White House action would have fatal effects for any journalist coverage of elected officials
 'white house corespondent association ne sienen ke cese kaa swaagat kiya or kaha ki white house parisar tak pahunch ko rokna ghatnaon par anuchit pratikriya ke baraabar he
 The association said, "we constantly appeal to the Trump administration to reverse the decision and complete the full reinstatement of the CNN correspondent
" ' The commissioner system will now be resorted to to improve law and order in the state, which has been suffering from incidents of gang rape one after the other
 betma or indore ke devas naake main haal hi main is tarah kii sharmnaak ghatnaayen hui hai jinke hafte bhar baad hi soobe ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne indore or bhopal main police kamishnari pranali lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kar di
 This announcement has brought the IAS and IPS lobbies of the state face to face
 rajya ke in do mahanagaron main yah system lagu ho jaataa he to yah pradesh ke iees adhikariyon ke liye jhatka hoga
 This is because the powers of IAS officers will be reduced
 iees or ipies lobby ke liye yah maamla sidhaa-sidhaa unke afasari ke jalwe kaa he
 Under the present system, the Collector, who is an IAS officer, is of great importance
 colector ke paas district magistrate kii shaktiyaan hai, police ko disha-nirdesh vahi detaa he
 The District Collector has the rights such as planting rasuka, raising the district, allowing firing in sensitive conditions
 lekin kamishnari lagu hone ke baad ye tamaam shaktiyaan police kamishnar ko hastantarit ho jaaegi or colector kii bhoomika mahaj rajasav adhikari kii rah jaaegi
 But the current question is whether Chauhan will be able to dare to implement this system
 purv ke anubhav isi ore ishaara karte hai
 In the last 25 years, every Chief Minister has repeatedly reiterated the need to implement this system, but no one could muster the courage to reduce the influence of the IAS lobby
 lekin neshnal krime record beuro kii haalia report main bhopal-indore ko badhate aparaadh vaale shaharon main shumaar kiye jane kaa zikr karte hue pradesh ke purv atirikt police mahanideshak surajeet singh kehete hai, ‘report ko gambhirtha se lekar sarkaar ko system main sudhaar laana hi hoga
 'actually, the police system of the state is being operated only by the Police Act of 1861 made by the British
 supreme court ke nirdesh par kai rajyon ne is act main sanshodhan kar kamishnari system ko lagu kiya he
 In the state too, a draft was prepared by the Group of Ministers and the team of IPS officers, which is limited to papers
 haalanki kamishnari ke mudde par iees or ipies ab khulkar saamne aa gaye hai
 Former home secretary and IAS officer of the state Bhagirath Prasad says, 'indore and Bhopal are not such big cities where commissioners are needed
 yahaan colector ke adheen vyavastha hi thik he
 To substantiate his argument, he refers to the recent incident at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, where women, children and sleeping people were lathi-charged
 lekin haal hi main pradesh ke dijipi pad se ritair es
 K
 raut is raay se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 He says, 'district collectors have a lot of responsibility
 har sarkari yojana unheen ke jariye sanchalit hoti he
 In such cases, matters related to law and order should be within the jurisdiction of the police
 ’ indore-bhopal kaa iji rah chuke ipies adhikari shailendra shrivastav bhi kamishnari pranali ko vakt kii jarurat maanate hai
 According to him, with this system at least ten senior IPS will be posted in the district, which will benefit the city
 trephic police or khufia vibhaag bhi kamishnari pranali ke aadhunik tantra kii madad se behatar pradarshan kar paaegaa
 The IAS lobby is avoiding public comment on the Chief Minister's announcement in this regard
 lekin unki daleel he ki indore or bhopal jaise shaharon ke liye nai pranali mufeed nahin hogi
 The government will also have to answer heavily on human rights matters related to the police
 haalanki indore kii iji anuraadhaa shankar kahati hai, ‘yah mudda iees yaa ipies lobby ke jalwe kaa nahin balki aadhunik or vikasshil police pranali kaa he
 However, until a new system is created, the police are periodically marching to create fear in the minds of criminals
 maharashtra ke aurangabad main beeti raat do samudaayon ke bich hinsa main jamkar updrav machaa
 Throughout the night, people either ran fearfully or spread violence causing violence

 The situation has been under control since Saturday morning, peace has been established, but the atmosphere is still tense
 is tarah bhadki hinsadrasal aurangabad main donon samudaayon ke bich tanaav kaa maahaul guuruuvaar se hi banane laga tha
 The Aurangabad metropolitan municipality started a campaign to cut illegal water connections from Thursday
 guuruuvaar ko aurangabad ke moti karanja ilaake main nagar nigam ne avaidh pani ke conection kaate
 But a community erupted over the water connection being disconnected by the Municipal Corporation and accused the Municipal Corporation of disconnecting the water connections of people belonging to the same community, while the illegal water connections of other communities were not disconnected
 isi baat ko lekar donon samudaayon ke bich tanaav kii sthiti panpi
 An atmosphere of tension had started forming since Friday afternoon, which turned into violence by night

 It is also being said that in Aurangabad, most of the councilors of a particular political party were elected, rumors about which are also hot
 do maheene se rikt he kamishnar kaa padgauratlab he ki aurangabad main is samay kamishnar kaa pad rikt he
 According to the information, there was tension in Aurangabad for several months regarding the disposal of waste
 kachare ke niptaan ke mudde par logon kii naaraazgi sanbhaalane main naakaam rahane ke baad aurangabad ke kamishnar amitesh kumaar ko chuttee par bhej diya gaya or baad main unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 Since then, Special IG Milind Bharambe has held the additional charge of commissioner of Aurangabad for the last two months
 milind bharambe ne bataai ye vajahaurangabad kamishnar kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahe special IG milind bharambe ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki do samudaayon ke bich chote si baat ko lekar jhadap shuru hua
 Stones broke out between the two communities, after which the violence spread to the surrounding areas
 afvaah bhadakaane ke chalate yah hinsa or bhadki
 But now the situation has been brought under control
 hinsak bheed ko kaabo main karne ke liye police ne rabar bullate chalaae, jo ek vyakti ko samvedansheel jagah ja lagi, jisase uski maut ho gai
 This is unfortunate
 shanti bahaali ke liye donon samudaayon ke netaaon se baatcheet chal rahi he
 There is a rift between the two communities over some things that are being investigated
 har saal pani kii killat se jujhataa he aurangabadgauratlab he ki aurangabad maharashtra kemrathavadailaake main aata he or har saal garmiyon main marathavada ilaake main pani kii killat ho jaati he
 Aurangabad has to bear the maximum brunt of this water shortage in Marathwada

 Despite this, the commissioner was not appointed in Aurangabad for the last two months, which is being seen as a gross negligence of the state government
