 Yes, definitely from women
 da times online ke mutabik yah adhyayan 30 se 59 saal ke logon ke 1990 kii janaganana par aadhaarit he
 It was found that men who married smart women should live more
 adhyayan main maaloom chalaa ki kam padhe-likhe log zyada jite hai
 However, it was also found that in the long life of men, their studies matter more than writing their studies

 Shivaratri is considered the night of shiva-parvati's marriage
 isliye is din in donon kii saath puja karne kaa vishesh mahatv bataaya gaya he
 Astrologer Praveen Mishra says that every form of Shakti is inherent with Shiva, so they should be worshiped together on Mahashivaratri
 jaane, koun sa phool chadhaane se shiv ji hote hai prasann
 
 
 Worshiping Shiva and Shakti brings blessings of wealth, happiness and prosperity
 puranic katha yah bhi he ki ek baar parvati ji ne bhagwaan shankar se poocha tha, 'aisa koun-sa vrath he, jisase mrityulok ke praani aapaki krupa sahaj praapt kar lete hai?' uttar main shivaji ne parvati ko 'shivaratri' ke vrath kaa upaay bataaya tha
 Therefore, worshiping on this day brings special blessings of Bholenath
 pati kii lambii aayu ke liye shivaratri ke din jarur karen ye 5 kaammana jaataa he ki is din shivpurana kaa paath sunanaa chahie
 Also, mother Parvati must also be worshiped at the time of Shiva worship
 ye hote hai laabh- chunki shivaratri, shiv-shakti ke vivaah kii raat he isliye donon kaa saath pujan har tarah ke sukh-suvidhaayen-sampatti pradaan karata he
 - Worshiping Lord Shiva surrounded by all Ganas and Nandi with Mata Parvati brings honor
 mahashivaratri main is shubh muhoort main karen shiv pujan- sir par chandramaa or jataa par ganga dhaaran kiye bhagwaan shiv kii god main maa parvati or saath main kartikeya-ganesh kii puja karne se sabhi jhagade khatm hote hai or ghar main sukh-shanti aati he
 The glory of Ardhanarishwar form of Lord Shiva is no less
 isaki puja karne se patni sukh praapt hota he or vaivaahik jivan sukhi rahata he
 Shiva ji is pleased with Rudrabhishek, will make every wish fulfilled - worshiping Kartikeya with Lord Shiva and Parvati fulfills all desires

 This decision was presented as a 'war' on black money, giving the Prime Minister a moral edge and the applause of the poor
 garibon kaa yahi chunaav kshetra he jise modi khub soch-samajhakar saadhane main jute hai
 Critics believe that Modi's arrogance and arrogance will ultimately lead to his downfall

 Modi has accepted that he is a cherished person of destiny
 hindustan kii siyasat main bhavishyavaanee karnaa khatre se khaali nahin
 Nevertheless, it can be said with some certainty that Modi has changed the nature of the contest
 ab maidan or media, donon main badhati tivrata ke saath raashtrapati chunaav kii tarj par netritv ke chunaav ladgaye honge
 Even in government, Modi is still on the treadmill of an election campaign, a political ceo-cum-event manager who wants to speed up work and represent the aspirations of a 'new' India

 Indeed, during the match, Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa appeared to be rubbing the ball, removing something from his trouser pocket

 Actually, two videos went viral during the 14th and 23rd overs of the Indian innings
 jisamen jampa ko apane haathon ko jeb main daalate hue or uske baad phir gend ko kisi cheez se ragadate dekha gaya
 Later he put the thing back in his trouser pocket
 haalanki abhi tak jampa ke is karname par adhikarik rup se koi pushti nahin hui he

 savita kaa arth hota he, surya yaa tej, par kavyitri savita singh ke sandarbh main aisa nahin he
 She is only a 'woman' even though she bears the lion with her name
 apni sampoornataa main bhi, or adhuurepan main bhi
 They have a unique blend of vibrancy and naturalness

 jo bhi kabhi mila unase, vah unki aawaaj kaa or jisane bhi padhaa, vah unki lekhnee kaa kavitaaon kaa kaayal ho gaya

 unka pehla kavita-sangrah 'apane jaisaa jivan' saal 2001 main hindi academy dwaara puraskrit hua
 He realized the heart of the woman so strongly that in his poems, he was automatically expressed
 isaki baangi unki adhikansh kavitaaon main milti he
 But the woman of Savita Singh's poem is not only an expression of pain, but also of courage
 unki 'darpan si hansi' kavita kii shuruaati line dekhie-ek hansi darpan-si apane hothon par rakh lee thi usnejismen devataaon ne dekhe apane dukh

 khaas anshtaap apane bachapan ke bare main kuch bataaie?savita singhamera bachapan ek jaadui bachapan tha
 In which everyday they learned new things, studied new things, met new people, ate new fruits
 nai chidiya dekhati thi, prakruti ko bahut pasand karti thi
 There was a big garden behind my house, there were different types of trees, so i used to be there often
 is tarah se meraa bachapan ek khushhaal bachapan tha
 Although my parents always lived abroad
 hamen acchhee bhartiya shiksha mili isliye unalogon ne hamen yahaan chhod rakhaa tha
 Here we lived in a united, full family with uncle, aunt, grandparents and siblings
 hamaara parivaar ek sampann parivaar tha to bhautik rup se koi abhaav nahin tha, koi dukh nahin tha
 But the effect of not being with the parents was psychologically affected
 haalanki lagaataar mata-pita aate jate rahete the, phir bhi ek tarah kaa gap jo creat hua vah ek dhabbe ke rup main aaj bhi bachaa hua he
 Maybe that's why i spent all my time in reading and writing
 kyonki meraa maananaa he ki padhane-likhane kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 He is a part of your self
 gyaan kii aisi duniya main chale janaa jahaan aapke har sawaalon kaa jawaab miltaa rahata he
 That's why i put myself to acquire knowledge
 isane mujhe swatantra evam swytt banaaya
 That's why i created my own world
 andar kii duniya ko main achche se samajhane lagi thi
 With this i cut off from people and made a separate solitude
 kitabon kii duniya ke bich
 There was a big library in my house, my grandfather's, they were all very writing people
 to ham shahar main bhi rahete the, gaanv main bhi, phir apane parents ke paas videsh bhi jate the, khaskar kuwait, jahaan mere pitaaji zyaadaatar rahete the
 Iran, Iraq, Moscow visited these places
 hamaara jivan kahin ek jagah sthir nahin tha
 As it was an outside journey, it was an inside journey
 isiilie mujhe bachapan se hi lagata tha ki is jivan kaa uddeshy kuch or he
 This is not a normal life
 saare bachche apane maanbaap ke saath ek jagah rahete hai, ham log das jagah rahete hai
 But there was no such deficiency, but the spot she was in was in itself
 vah aaj bhi he
 That is why this writing continues till now
 aapkaa aupchaarik lekhan kab shuru hua? aapako kab laga ki aap likh sakati hai? yahi meraa rasta he?savita singhmbachapan se, saat-aath saal kii umr se hi maine likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Started writing diary from childhood
 jo bhi dekhati uske bare main, chidiya, chintiyon ke bare main, prakruti main jo bhi sundar tha, use dekhati, likhti thi
 The early type of writing which was in the diary also took the form of poetry
 par aupchaarik taur par jab maine skool paas kar liya or garmiyon kii chhuttiyaan ain, to maine bahut sari kavitaayen likhin or mujhe laga ki main kavita likh sakati hum
 But there was no curiosity about printing at that time
 main bas acha likhnaa chaahati thi
 Speak your mind as i wanted
 tollstoy ko, dostovsky ko padhati thi, unki kitabon se meraa ghar bharaa tha, to main vaisaa likhnaa chaahati thi
 i used to write poems very easily
 aap hindi or angreji donon bhashaaon main likhti hai? kis bhashaa main likhnaa aapako zyada sukun detaa he?savita sinhamushkil he kahana
 Because on one level, languages create the same world for a person, because language is the world
 meraa to maananaa he ki isi main prem or ekant donon sambhav he
 i have a poem 'ruth's dream', that is it
 sukun he donon hi bhashaaon main
 If i write in a third language, it is also relaxed
 kavita main jaakar aap, bhashaa main jaakar aap apana sabakuch paa lete hai
 What is your language of thinking? Savita Singh: There are two, three language of my thinking
 hindi, angreji or bhojpuri
 It is very strange that when i talk to people who talk in Bhojpuri, i think in their language
 yahi hindi or angreji ke saath bhi he
 All languages keep moving along
 sabhi se utana hi prem, lagaav va sukun he
 Your favorite work, favorite work? Savita Singh: This question is also very difficult to answer
 kyonki jin chizon ko aap pasand karte hai, padhate hai aap, unhen padhate hue hi aap manushya banate hai
 So how many books will be there that will help you
 par ek kitaab kii main avashya charchaa karuungi vah upanyaas he jine ir, yah ek adbhut noval he
 i believe that all people must have read it
 hindi main mujhe mahadevi bahut acchhee lagati hai
 Sylvia Plath, Emily Dickinson, Dostoevsky are my favorite authors
 jo rachanaaen aapako rachati hai, vah vahi hoti hai, jo aapaki pasandida hoti hai
 Why is a woman the main character of your poem? Why is her suffering, loneliness, struggle? Savita Singh: My compositions are feminist poems
 meri chetana kaa jo sansar he, usamen stri kii pidaa kaa bahut maani he
 It seems to me that pain has created a woman
 usapar jo atyaachaar hote hai vahi use gadhata he
 Wherever i went all over the world, Montreal where i did my phd, lived in England, everywhere i saw that men and women were not equal
 ve baraabar isliye nahin hai ki unamem shaareerik banaavat main koi antar he, balki yah samaaj striyon ko paradheen banaakar rakhana chahta he
 This is a great misery, the blame of this world
 meraa jo academik jivan he, usamen main raajnneeti siddhanti hum, par main andar hi andar apane ko femenism ke kareeb paati hum
 Between the principles of democracy, equality, Marx, etc
 there is no talk about the woman who is a big section
 main chetana ke jis daur main hum usamen striyon kii mukti ko main sabase bada prashn maanati hum
 i believe that humanity has to solve it

 Contrary to this belief, Nirmala Sitharaman was promoted from the Commerce Ministry and given the responsibility of direct defense
 beete teen saal ke dauraan bataur commers ministar nirmala sitaraman kii aisi kya uplabdhiyaan raheen ki parformens ko aadhaar banaakar unhen yah jimmedaari di gai? yaa phir di gai is jimmedaari kaa mahaj raajnneetik kaaran he ki nirmala ek 'power ladi' banakar ubhari hai
 Venkaiah Naidu was the biggest face for the BJP so far from South India
 unhen uparashtrapati bana die jane ke baad party ke liye sabase badi chunauti dakshin main ek nayaa cheharaa dene kii thi
 Nirmala hails from Tamil Nadu
 dakshin ke rajyon main sabhi raajnneetik dalon se unke achche sambandh rahe hai or unka puraa raajnneetik safar vivaadon se dur rahaa he
 In such a situation, BJP had no better leader than Nirmala to replace Venkaiah

 For this reason, he is also holding on to English as well as Hindi

 In the states of Narendra Modi South, the biggest challenge before the BJP is the assembly elections in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in 2018
 vahiin, cabinet vistaar se pehle or venkaiya naidu ke uparashtrapati banane ke baad modi sarkaar main dakshin se koi bada mantri nahin tha
 By promoting Nirmala, the Modi government has given clear indication to these states that the southern states have their own importance in the central government
 inke alaava nirmala ko power ladi banane main ek ahm paksh yah tha ki modi sarkaar main kisi tej-tarraar vyakti ke haath main dephence mantralay kii kaman nahin di jaani thi
 Due to this, this ministry again and again remained under the Finance Minister as another command
 ab dephence kii jimmedaari nirmala ko dene ke baad saaf he ki mantralay ke sabhi chote-bade faisle pradhanmantri kii nigaraanee main liye ja sakenge
 Significantly, due to these political reasons, Nirmala has been given the charge of the Ministry of Defense, it is also clear that during the last 3 years, she has not had any special achievement as a Minister of Commerce
 pichley teen saal ke dauraan export ke aankade hon yaa industrial sector ke parformens yaa phir lagaataar jidipi main darj hoti giravat is baat ko or pukhta karti hai ki nirmala kaa yogadan koi khaas nahin rahaa he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley alone cannot be held responsible for this situation on the economic front, as Nirmala is also responsible for him in these areas

 Highly placed police sources said that in view of the 'advisory' issued from the police headquarters, the Inspector General of Police of all the divisions called a meeting of the major hotel operators in their respective areas and instructed them to install CCTV cameras for safety
 bhopal sambhag ke police mahanireekshak dow
 Shailendra Shrivastava said in a meeting that at present there is no such arrangement in hotels, so installing CCTV in these hotels is necessary from the security point of view

 The Sun is considered to be a planet that spreads satvikta and auspiciousness
 yah vyakti ke jivan main prakaash failaata he
 Saturn is considered to be a vengeful and rigid planet
 yah vyakti ke jivan main sangharsh or andhkaar paidaa karata he
 The results of the meeting of light and darkness are very strange
 isse surya bhi dooshit hota he or shani bhi
 And what are its common effects? - Sun with Saturn together - Sun's sight on Saturn or Saturn's sight on Sun- This causes problems in the relationship between father and son - due to this marital life is spoiled- Sometimes the sum of two marriages is also formed
 How does the relation of Sun and Saturn affect the relationship of father and son? - Father and son's mutual behavior is never good - father, son sometimes Get away from each other - sometimes the father is able to make only one of the sons - sometimes, after making a million efforts, the father or son does not get happiness
 - Provide water to the sun every morning - Standing there and read Hanuman Chalisa - Wear a copper ring in the ring finger - Use good instead of sugar in food - Donate sweet cheese on Saturday
 How is the relation of Sun Saturn related to marital life? Puts Hapti wife can not love each other Pate- face each other 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 shailendra pandeya - jyotish There was a strong debate in the Lok Sabha on Thursday to get the triple talaq bill passed
 kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne loksabhaa main kaha ki ise raajnneetik chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie, kyonki iskaa makasad muslim mahilaon ko shashakt bananaa he
 On the other hand, the opposition insisted that it should be sent to the Joint Select Committee

 In favor of the passage of the bill, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the bill is not against any community, religion, faith, but it will fix justice for women
 unhone kaha, janvari 2018 se 10 disambar ke bich, hamaare saamne teen talaak ke kareeb 477 maamle aae
 Even on Wednesday, such a case came to us from Hyderabad
 inhen vajahon se ham adhyadesh laae the
 Stating that 20 Islamic nations have banned triple talaq, the minister asked why this did not happen in a secular country like India? Urging the House to pass the bill unanimously, he said, i urge that it should not be seen from a political perspective
 is sadan ne dushkarmiyon ke liye faansee kaa praavdhaan diya he
 This House has passed a bill against domestic violence to protect the interests of dowry and women
 isliye, ham kyon nahin is vidheyak kaa ekaswar main samarthan kar sakate
 Prasad said that the government is working with an 'open mind' for this and there is no partiality in this
 iske alaava nae vidheyak ke antargat pehle uthaai gai kai chintaaon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 He said that the bill should not be opposed for political reasons
 prasad ne kaha, "ise raajnneeti ke najariye se nahin dekha janaa chahie, balki maanavtaa ke najariye se dekha janaa chahie
 If there is any concrete suggestion, the government will consider it
 "loksabhaamein pichley saal disambar main yah vidheyak paarit ho gaya tha lekinrajyasabhaamein yah paarit nahin ho sakaa tha
 The new bill was introduced in the House amidst uproar this month with some changes
 isse pehle vipakshi sadasyon ne vidheyak ko laae jane kaa virodh kiya or ise sanyukt pravar samiti ke paas bheje jane kii maang kii
 The new bill has been replaced by an ordinance introduced in September, which prohibits Muslim women from divorcing them by saying 'divorce' on behalf of their husbands
 iske antargat tatkaal teen talaak ko dandaniaparadhbanaya gaya he, jiske tahat jurmaane ke saath teen saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 This offense will be cognizable when the married Muslim woman or her close relative will give information against the person who has given three immediate divorces

 This is a constitutional matter
 yah ek khaas dharm se sambandhit bhi he
 i urge that this bill be referred to the Select Committee
 prasad ne vipaksh ke virodh ko khaarij kar diya or kaha ki congress ne pichley saal teen talaak vidheyak kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Ravi Shankar Prasadne said, when the bill was brought before the House, members of Congress supported it and voted in its favor
 us samay unhone ise pravar samiti ke paas bheje jane kii maang nahin kii thi
 Premchand strongly opposed the bill and said that it is against the basic principles of the constitution
 unhone kaha, "vidheyak ko jaldbaaji main laayaa gaya he
 It is inspired by politics and has been brought in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla rival each other until the 1990s, but are now working together in the film 'gulab Gang'
 juhi kahati hai ki film main maadhuri kii maujuudagi ke kaaran hi unhone yah film kii
 "I did this film because of Madhuri being in it," Juhi said here on Friday at the launch of 'gulab Gang' song 'slow Motion'
 maine vastav main film kii patakatha kii vajah se aisa kiya
 i thought it would be wonderful if we worked together
 maadhuri ke saath pehle din hui meri baat mujhe yaad he, jisamen maine unase kaha tha ki 'maadhuri, ham ise dhamaakedaar banaaenge' or hamane kar diya
 He said, i would say that there were some occasions in the past when we could work together, but at that time i did not film because Madhuri was in it
 maine sochaa ki agar vah isamen hai, tab main kya karuungi? The 'gulab Gang', inspired by a women's group operating in the Bundlekhund area, is on 7 March
 yah mahila shashaktikaran ke bare main he
 Bollywood actor is a fan of Nawazuddin Siddiqui's actress
 unka safar bollywood main kaise shuru hua or kaise wo ek stregalar se sthapit actor bane ye baaten to aapane khabaron main padhi hi hongi lekin ab unki reel se lekar real life ke ankahe pahalu jald hi aapke saamne honge
 Nawaz is soon to launch his autobiography 'the Incredible Life of the Drama King of India'
 navaj kii biography ko patrkaar rituparna chatarji or unke bich kii baatcheet ke rup main likhaa gaya hai
 In this book of Nawaz, you will be written specially from his film career to personal life straggler

 But despite this Priyanka's arrival in politics has a meaning
 chaahe yah jitna bhi bahesatlab ho, lekin bhartiya raajnneeti bahut dur tak chhaviyon ke aasapaas gumti rahi he
 From Narendra Modi to lalu-mayawati, Rahul has been reaping the benefits and disadvantages of his image
 pichley dinon rahul kii ek pappu chhavi banaai gai
 That image is finally breaking
 priyanka gandhi kii bhi apni sankshipt raajnneetik sakriyata ke dauraan ek chhavi bani he
 It is common opinion that they have an innate quality of meeting people or activists
 pichley chunaavon ke dauraan unhone ise sabit bhi kiya he
 Secondly, people see the image of their grandmother Indira in them
 haalanki priyanka main ek tarah kii mriduta he or maanviyata bhi
 Her sensitive attitude towards the perpetrators of the assassination of her father Rajiv Gandhi suggests that she thinks out of the box and does not value vengeance
 lekin sirf manushya hone, sahaj hone yaa logon se ghul-mil jane se chunaav nahin jite ja sakate
 The 2019 war will not be won by such simplified assumptions
 usamen saare sameekaran saadhane kii ekaagratha or ek-ek inch zamin jeetne kii yuyutsa chahie hogi
 In the pair of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, there is this aggression, this youth, this desire to keep fighting
 duusari taraf rahul gandhi main aksar iskaa abhaav dikhataa he
 On the occasion of his ascent within the Congress, he remembered his mother's lesson that power is poison
 baad ke kai avasaron par dikhaa ki jab daant bheench kar ladane kii zarurat rahi, ve muskura kar kahin or nikal jate rahe
 The meaning of Priyanka's arrival opens from here
 ab rahul or priyanka kii jodi congress main us mahatvakanksha kaa nae sire se sanchaar kar sakati he jisaki kami congress kaaryakarta mahasoos karata rahaa he
 They are like a pebble in some stagnant pond of Congress which will cause waves to go far
 itani bhar halchal congress kaaryakartaaon ke liye chunaavon main ek bada fark paidaa kar sakati he
 Secondly, it is important to understand that the Congress of Rahul and Priyanka is quite different from the old Congress
 is congress main indira gandhi kii lagaai hui immergency ke prati ek tarah kaa sankoch bhav he, 1984 kii hinsa ko lekar rajeev gandhi kii pratikriya se yah congress alag he
 It is a Congress of two decent and bona fide youths who are more loyal towards dalits-adivasis-farmers
 mirchpur kii hinsa ko lekar rahul kaa ravaiya ho yaa niamgiri ke adivaasiyon ke saath khadey hone kaa maamla- is congress ne apni bhinnata dikhaai he
 Of course, this is not a revolutionary change
 congress ab bhi kai un durgunon kii maari he jo bijepi ne usase kahin zyaada tezi se sikh liye hai
 But the big bet that Congress could play before a big election within the limits of parliamentary politics, is definitely that bet
 kyonki isse ladaai kaa morcha or maidan bhi kuch badal jaataa he
 The BJP now has to compete with Priyanka in addition to Rahul
 duusare dalon ko ab apane talmail yaa moltol main priyanka kaa bhi khyal rakhana he
 For Congress workers, this is the change that can create a new flavor in them
 in sabake baavjood yah sawaal bachaa rahata he ki 2019 ke chunaav kaa nakshaa kya priyanka kii upasthiti se badalegaa? is sawaal kaa jawaab to 2019 ke chunaav denge, lekin yah sawaal bataata he ki ham bahut chote-chote sandarbhon main sochane ke aadi ho gaye hai
 Regardless of the outcome of 2019, Priyanka's activism will still be necessary for the Congress, - and possibly make Indian politics more likely

 Is the Election Commission waiting for the Prime Minister's "official" travel programs to conclude before announcing dates for General Elections? - Ahmed Patel (@ahmedpatel) was also delayed on March 4, 2019, 2018
 The Commission has been constantly targeted by opposition parties

 The delay in the election of Rajasthan was also questioned
 Earlier, during the elections held in five states, similar allegations were made
 rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, mizoram or telugana ke chunaav kii adhisuchana jari hone main deree hone par congress ne sawaal uthaae the
 Chhattisgarh elections were held in two phases on 12 and 20 November
 madhya pradesh or mizoram main 28 november or rajasthan-telugana main 7 disambar ko voting hui thi
 After Modi's rally, the EC had announced that the Congress had also accused the Election Commission at the time that it delayed issuing election notification due to PM Modi's rally
 congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki chunaav ayog ne pehle 6 oktober ko press conference kaa vakt 12
 30 pm, but under PM Modi's pressure, the time was extended to three in the afternoon
 3 Facts- Draw your own conclusions
 1
 ECI announces a PC at 12
 30 today to announce elction dates to the 5 states
 2
 PM Modi is addressing a rally in Ajmer, Rajasthan at 1 PM today
 3
 ECI sudden changes the time of announcement and PC to 3 PM
 Independence of ECI?— Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala)october 6, 2018ayog ko deni padi thi safaisurajevaala ne aarope lagaae the ki rajasthan ke ajmer main piem modi kii dopaher ek baje raily honi thi
 Due to this, the Commission delayed to announce the election
 congress ke aarope par chunaav ayog ko safai bhi deni padi thi
 The Commission had said that it was not delayed in announcing the election because of the pm's rally, but because of some necessary preparations
 adhisuchana jari karne kaa kya he niyamchunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan niyam ke anusaar matdaan se 21 din pehle tak ho janaa chahie
 As soon as the notification is issued, due to the implementation of the code of conduct, all government functions are very limited, affecting many things
 isliye koshish kii jaati he ki aachaar samhita kii avadhi behad simit rahe
 The Gujarat election was also surrounded by delays EC The Congress also questioned the commission on the delay in Gujarat elections
 12 oktober 2017 ko chunaav ayog ne himachal pradesh ke chunaav kaa to elaan kar diya, lekin gujarat chunaav par kuch nahin kaha
 When the Congress raised questions on the commission, the then Chief Election Commissioner AK Jyoti clarified that there has been a flood in Gujarat, in which more than 200 people have died
 aise main agar abhi chunaav kii adhisuchana jari ho jaati he to raahat or bachaav kaary prabhavit honge
 So it was delayed
 chunaav ke elaan se pehle hajaaron karod kii saugatus samay soshal media par bijepi ke khilaaf maahaul tha

 in) The leading petitioner of the fodder scam and a senior BJP leader narrowly escaped charges of eating fodder scam money
 iskaa khulaasa hota he beur jail se likhe ek aaropee ke patr se jisamen kaha gaya he ki chaara ghotaale ke kingping esabi sinha is maamle ke aaropee keem prasad par dabaav daal rahe the ki wo apane bayaan main kahe ki susheel kumaar modi ko 5 lakh rupee die the
 On July 29, 1996, in a letter from Patna's Beur Jail to the CBI Patna SP, a tremendous conspiracy was going on inside the jail to implicate those who are petitioners in this case
 chaara ghotaale ke pramukh yachikakarta main bijepi ke netaa susheel kumaar modi kaa naam koi kaise bhul saktaa he
 He was instrumental in exposing the fodder scam, so he was the target of the scamsters
 sibiai ko likhe patr main kaha gaya he ki chaara ghotaale ke kingping esabi sinha ne isliye susheel kumaar modi ko fansaane kii sajeesh rachi thi taaki unki bolti band ho jaye
 No one else is writing this letter but Umesh Prasad Singh is the mastermind of this scam
 unhone sibiai ke espi ko patr likhaa or is sajeesh se avgat karaayaa tha
 On 28 July, when he arrived at Beur's hospital to see KM Prasad, who was sick, he told him this and said that i have only seen Modi in newspapers and TV, i have never met him and never given money, then how can he Should i be stuck maa bhagwati kabhi maaf nahin karengi
 At that time, Umesh Prasad was lodged in Beur Jail in Patna in the fodder scam case
 unka kahana he ki jaanch kii disha badalane ke liye tamaam tarah kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi thi, jisamen ek sajeesh ye bhi thi
 Similarly, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been accused of taking money in the fodder scam
 is sambandh main ek yachika jharkhand hoicourt main daayar he jis par 22 november ko sunwaayee hone vaali he
 Regarding this, all kinds of accusations are going on in Bihar politics
 kabhi nitish kumaar ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar chalane vaale upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ab sibiai par aarope laga rahe hai ki nitish kumaar or shivanand tiwari ko jaanboojh kar choda gaya
 Interestingly, the CBI did not make him an accused in 1996, but the situation is now being told that the Congress is using the CBI for an alliance with the JDU
 khayr ye to soch kii baat he, ab aate hai mudde par
 The main basis for accusing Nitish Kumar and Shivanand Tiwari is based on the statement given by SB Sinha, the kingpin of the fodder scam in Ranchi under 161, in which he said that the Samata Party of Nitish Kumar was paid 1 crore for the election expenses
 Rupees were given in 1994
 saath hi shivanand tiwari ko usee saal beti kii shaadi ke liye 30 se 40 lakh rupee die the or ye rupee umesh prasad singh ne apane haathon se die the
 Umesh Prasad Singh said that i have not given any money and why SB Sinha gave these statements only in front of CBI SP NC Dhodhiyal and DSP Shravan Kumar in Ranchi, while SB Sinha gave statement in about 7 places after that, but Did not mention it
 umesh prasad singh ke bare main kaha jaye to chaara ghotaalaa ke pramukh sutaradhar rahen he
 They know one thing about this scam
 ye nigaraanee vibhaag main section officer the lekin ye ghotaale main ek badi kadi hai
 He also played an important role in exposing it, although due to this he also had to go to jail, but the CBI later acquitted him

 In 1993, a coalition was formed by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and BSP chief Kanshi Ram to oust BJP
 us samay uttarakhand, uttar pradesh kaa hissaa tha or kul seat thim 422
 Mulayam contested 256 seats and gave 164 seats to BSP
 chunaav main espi or bispi gathbandhan jeeta
 SP got 109 seats and BSP got 67 seats, followed by Mulayam Singh Yadav with the support of BSP
 lekin, aapasi manmutav ke chalate 2 june, 1995 ko basapa ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya or samarthan vaapasi kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Because of this, Mulayam Singh's government was reduced to a minority
 sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye jod-ghataav kiye jane lage
 In the end, when the matter did not come to an end, angry SP activists and mlas reached the State Guest House located at Meerabai Marg, Lucknow, where Mayawati was staying in room number-1
 2 june 1995 ke din uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main jo hua vah shaayad hi kahin hua hoga
 Mayawati was attacked in room number one of the guest house
 2 june 1995 ko mayawati lakhanu ke state guest house ke cameraa number ek main apane vidhayakon ke saath baithak kar rahi thim
 At around three in the afternoon, a mob of alleged Samajwadi Party workers suddenly attacked the guest house
 kanshiram ke baad bispi main duusare number kii netaa mayawati us vakt ko jindagi bhar nahin bhul saktin
 That day, a frenzied mob of mlas and supporters of a Samajwadi Party was intent on attacking the Dalit leader's name in the name of teaching a lesson 
 mayawati ke jivan par aadhaarit ajay bose kii kitaab 'bahanji' main guestaouse main us din ghati ghatana kii jaankaree vistaar se detaa he
 It is said that in the 1995 guesthouse scandal, when some SP SP goons allegedly stabbed BSP supremo Mayawati in a room and tore her clothes
 kisi tarah mayawati ne apane ko kamare main band kiya tha or baahar se samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak or samarthak darwaja todane main lage hue the
 Meanwhile, BJP MLA Bramhadutt Dwivedi is said to have played his life and rushed the SP mlas and supporters
 bataa den ki brahmadatt dvivedi kii chhavi bhi dabang netaa kii thi
 In UP politics, this scandal is called guesthouse scandal and it is a stigma on the forehead of India's politics
 khud mayawati bramhadatt dvivedi ko bhai kehane lageen or saarvajanik taur par kahati raheen ki apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bina unhone meri jaan bachaai thi
 For information, let us know that Brahmadatta was a servant of Dwivedi Sangh and he also knew how to handle lathi, so he had a fight with armed goons with a stick
 yahi vajah he ki mayawati ne bhi unhen hameshaa apana bada bhai mana or kabhi unke khilaaf apana ummidavaar khadaa nahin kiya
 Mayawati continued to oppose the BJP across the state, but campaigned for Brahmadatta Dwivedi in Farrukhabad
 kaha jaataa he ki jab gundon ne baad main brahmadatt dvivedi kii goli markar hatya kar di tab mayawati unke ghar gayi or foot-foot kar royee
 When her widow contested the election, Mayawati did not field any candidate against her, but appealed to the people to vote for my brother's widow who was martyred by taking hostility to save my life
 kuch reporton ke anusaar cheekh-pukaar machaate hue ve (samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak, kaaryakarta or bheed) ashleel bhashaa or gaali-galouj kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 The mlas sitting in the Common Hall (bahujan Samaj Party mlas) quickly closed the main gate, but the herd broke it open
 phir ve asahaay basapa vidhayakon par tut pade or unhen thappad maarane or latiyaane lage
 It is said that at least five BSP mlas were dragged and forced into vehicles on the outside of the guest house which took them to the Chief Minister's residence
 in vidhayakon ko raajbahadur ke netritv main basapa vidrohi gut main shaamil hone ke liye or ek kaagaj par mulaayam singh sarkaar ko samarthan dene kii shapath lete hue dastakhat karne ko kaha gaya tha
 Some of them were so scared that they signed it on blank paper
 vidhayakon ko raat main kaaphi der tak vahaan bandi banaae rakhaa gaya, jis samay atithigrih main basapa vidhayakon ko is tarah se dhar kar dabocha ja rahaa tha, jaise murgiyon ko kasaai khaane le jaaya ja rahaa ho, kamaron ke set 1-2 ke saamne, jahaan mayawati kuch vidhayakon ke saath baithi thim
 a strange drama was happening, some mlas escaped from the crowd outside and took refuge to hide in the same rooms

 The mlas hiding in the rooms were instructed by Lalchand to lock the doors from inside and they had just closed the doors so that a mob from the crowd roamed the corridor and started banging the door
 mayawati ko do kanishtha police afasaron himmat ne bachaaya
 These were Vijay Bhushan, the House Officer (SHO) at Hazratganj station, and Subhash Singh Baghel, who was the SHO (VIP), who took some of the soldiers along and pushed back the crowd with great difficulty

 This all went on for over an hour

 According to eyewitnesses, they were just standing and blowing cigarettes
 akraman shuru hone ke turant baad rahasyatmak dhang se, atithi grih kii bijli or pani kii supplai kaat di gai-prashasan kii mileebhagat kaa ek or sanket
 The situation there improved only after the District Magistrate of Lucknow arrived there
 unhone krodhit bheed kaa dat kar muqabla karne kii himmat or jaagrukta kaa parichay diya
 The District Magistrate, together with SP Rajiv Ranjan, first pushed the members of the mob outside the confines of the guest house, who were not mlas

 However, to do so, he had to resort to the lathi charge of the mlas
 phir bhi sapa ke vidhansabha sadasyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi na karne kii mukhyamantri ke karyaalay se mili chetavanee ko ansuni karke ve apane faisle par date rahe
 The transfer order was issued to the District Magistrate with immediate effect after 11 o'clock at night, as a result of not doing his duty without fear and favor
 tippaniyan As more and more defense teams started reaching the Governor's office, the central government and senior BJP leaders interfered, the situation inside the guest house was controlled
 jab rakshakon ne building ke andar or baahar kabja kar liya tab gaaliyaan, dhamkiyaan or naare lagaati hui bheed dhire-dhire kam hoti chali gai
 Mayawati and her group of party mlas who had locked themselves inside the room set 1-2, had to make repeated requests to the District Magistrate and other officials to make sure that the threat was averted, and they opened the door
 Could jab unhone darwaja kholaa, tab tak kaaphi raat ho chuki thi
 Since then, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh's relationship deteriorated
 uske baad se 24 saal tak donon dalon ke bich naa to chunaav purv or naa hi chunaav ke baad koi gathbandhan hua he
 It remains to be seen whether the hostility caused by the guest house scandal in the SP-BSP changes
 sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye jod-ghataav kiye jane lage
 In the end, when the matter did not come to an end, angry SP activists and mlas reached the State Guest House located at Meerabai Marg, Lucknow, where Mayawati was staying in room number-1

 uske baad se 24 saal tak donon dalon ke bich naa to chunaav purv or naa hi chunaav ke baad koi gathbandhan hua he
 It remains to be seen whether the hostility caused by the guest house scandal in the SP-BSP changes
 bataaya jaataa he ki, 1995 ke guestaouse cond main jab kuch kathith taur par sapa ke gundon ne basapa supremeo mayawati ko kamare main band karke maaraa or unke kapade faad die the
 Somehow Mayawati had locked herself in the room and Samajwadi Party mlas and supporters from outside were engaged in breaking the door
 is bich, kaha jaataa he ki apni jaan par khelkar bijepi vidhayak bramhadatt dvivedi maukey par pahunche or sapa vidhayakon or samarthakon ko peeche dhakela
 Please tell that the image of Brahmadutt Dwivedi was also of a domineering leader
 upi kii raajnneeti main is cond ko guestaouse cond kaha jaataa he or ye bharat kii raajnneeti ke maathe par kalank he
 Mayawati herself started calling Brahmadatta Dwivedi a brother and kept saying publicly that he had saved my life regardless of his life
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki bramhadatt dvivedi sangh ke sevak the or unhen lathi chalaani bhi bakhubi aati thi isliye wo ek lathi lekar hathiyaaron se las gundon se bhid gaye the
 This is the reason that Mayawati too always considered him her elder brother and never pitched her candidate against him
 puure rajya main mayawati bijepi kaa virodh karti raheen, lekin farrukhabad main bramhadatt dvivedi ke liye prachaar karti thim
 It is said that when the goons later shot and killed Brahmadutt Dwivedi, Mayawati went to her house and wept bitterly
 unki vidhwaa ne jab chunaav ladaa tab mayawati ne unke khilaaf koi ummidavaar nahin utaara balki logon se apil kii thi ki meri jaan bachaane ke liye dushmani mol lekar shahid hone vaale mere bhai kii vidhwaa ko vot den
 According to some reports, he (samajwadi Party mlas, activists and mob) was using vulgar language and abusive language
 kaaman haul main baithe vidhayakon (bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak) ne jaldi se mukhya dwaar band kar diya, parantu jhund ne use todakar khol diya
 Then they cracked down on the helpless BSP mlas and started slapping and thrashing them
 bataaya jaataa he ki kam-se-kam paanch basapa vidhayakon ko ghasitate hue jabardasti atithi grih ke baahar le jaakar gadiyon main daalaa gaya tha, jo unhen mukhyamantri ke nivas sthaan par le gaye
 These mlas were asked to sign and sign an oath to join the BSP rebel group led by Raj Bahadur and to support the Mulayam Singh government on a paper
 unamem se kuch to itane dar gaye the ki unhone kore kaagaj par hi dastakhat kar die
 The mlas were kept captive there for much of the night, at which time the BSP mlas were being held in the extreme house in such a way as to take the chickens to the butchers, in front of the set 1-2 of the rooms, Where Mayawati was sitting with some mlas
 ek vicitra naatak ghatit ho rahaa tha, baahar kii bheed se kuch-kuch vidhayak batch kar nikal aae the or unhone unheen kamaron me chhipane ke liye sharan le lee thi
 The last senior BSP leader to come in was RK Chaudhary, who was rescued under the supervision of constable Rashid Ahmed and Chaudhary's personal guard Lalchand
 kamaron main chhipe vidhayakon ko lalchand ne darvaaj andar se lock karne kii hidaayat di or unhone abhi daravaaje band hi kiye the ki bheed main se ek jhund galiyare main dhaddhadata hua ghusaa or darwaja peetane laga
 Mayawati was rescued by two junior police officers Himmat
 ye the vijay bhushan, jo hajratganj stesan ke house afasar (esechao) the or subhash singh baghel jo esechao (viipi) the, jinhone kuch sipaahiyon ko saath le kar badi mushkil se bheed ko peeche dhakela
 Then they all stood in queue in the corridor so that no one could cross them
 krodhit bheed ne phir bhi naare lagaana or gaaliyaan dena chaalu rakhaa or mayawati ko ghaseet kar baahar laane kii dhamkee detii rahi
 Apart from this courageous and timely action of some police officers, most of the officers present, including the handlers and security staff at the state guest house, made no attempt to stop the madness
 yah sab ek ghante se zyada samay tak chalata rahaa
 The statements of several BSP mlas and some police officers were shocking that while senior mlas of Lucknow OP Singh were also present at the time when the mlas were being kidnapped and Mayawati's rooms were under attack
 chashmadidon ke anusaar ve sirf khadey hue cigarette phoonk rahe the
 Immediately after the invasion began, the guest house's electricity and water supplies were cut off - another sign of the administration's collusion
 lakhanu ke jila magistrate ke vahaan pahunchane ke baad hi vahaan ki paristhiti main sudhaar aayaa
 He showed the courage and awareness of combating the angry mob
 espi rajeev ranjan ke saath milakar jila magistrat ne sabase pehle bheed ke un sadasyon ko atithigrih ke daayre ke baahar dhakela, jo vidhayak nahin the
 Later on the arrival of additional force organizations of the police, he got all the SP mlas, including the mlas, out of the purview of the state super-house
 yadhyapi aisa karne ke liye unhe vidhayakon par lathicharge karne ke hukum kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Still, he ignored the warning received from the Chief Minister's office not to take action against the SP members of the Assembly, and he stood by his decision
 apni duty bina dare or pakshpaat na karne ke falswaroop raat ko 11 baje ke baad jila magistrate ke liye tatkaal prabhavi rup se tabadale kaa hukum jari kar diya gaya
 The comments jaise hi rajyapal ke karyaalay, centre sarkaar or varisht bhaajapa netaaon ke dakhal dete hi zyada se zyada raksha dal vahaan pahunchane lage, atithi grih ke andar kii sthiti niyantrit hoti gai
 When the defenders took in and out of the building, the crowd started shouting, shouting slogans, threats and slogans
 mayawati or unke party vidhayakon ke samooh ko jinhone apane aap ko kamare ke set 1-2 ke andar band kiya hua tha, yakeen dilaane ke liye jila magistrate or anya adhikariyon ko baar anurodh karnaa padaa ki ab khatra tal gaya tha, or ve darwaja khol sakate the
 By the time they opened the door, it had been quite a night
 isi ke baad se mivati or mulaayam singh ke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Since then, there has been no alliance between the two parties neither pre-election nor post-election for 24 years
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki guest house cond se espi-bispi main hui dushmani kya apana rukh badalati he ? In UP politics, this scandal is called guesthouse scandal and it is a stigma on the forehead of India's politics
 khud mayawati bramhadatt dvivedi ko bhai kehane lageen or saarvajanik taur par kahati raheen ki apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bina unhone meri jaan bachaai thi
 For information, let us know that Brahmadatta was a servant of Dwivedi Sangh and he also knew how to handle lathi, so he had a fight with armed goons with a stick
 yahi vajah he ki mayawati ne bhi unhen hameshaa apana bada bhai mana or kabhi unke khilaaf apana ummidavaar khadaa nahin kiya
 Mayawati continued to oppose the BJP across the state, but campaigned for Brahmadatta Dwivedi in Farrukhabad
 kaha jaataa he ki jab gundon ne baad main brahmadatt dvivedi kii goli markar hatya kar di tab mayawati unke ghar gayi or foot-foot kar royee
 When her widow contested the election, Mayawati did not field any candidate against her, but appealed to the people to vote for my brother's widow who was martyred by taking hostility to save my life
 kuch reporton ke anusaar cheekh-pukaar machaate hue ve (samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak, kaaryakarta or bheed) ashleel bhashaa or gaali-galouj kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 The mlas sitting in the Common Hall (bahujan Samaj Party mlas) quickly closed the main gate, but the herd broke it open
 phir ve asahaay basapa vidhayakon par tut pade or unhen thappad maarane or latiyaane lage
 It is said that at least five BSP mlas were dragged and forced into vehicles on the outside of the guest house which took them to the Chief Minister's residence
 in vidhayakon ko raajbahadur ke netritv main basapa vidrohi gut main shaamil hone ke liye or ek kaagaj par mulaayam singh sarkaar ko samarthan dene kii shapath lete hue dastakhat karne ko kaha gaya tha
 Some of them were so scared that they signed it on blank paper
 vidhayakon ko raat main kaaphi der tak vahaan bandi banaae rakhaa gaya, jis samay atithigrih main basapa vidhayakon ko is tarah se dhar kar dabocha ja rahaa tha, jaise murgiyon ko kasaai khaane le jaaya ja rahaa ho, kamaron ke set 1-2 ke saamne, jahaan mayawati kuch vidhayakon ke saath baithi thim
 a strange drama was happening, some mlas escaped from the crowd outside and took refuge to hide in the same rooms
 andar aane vaale aakhri varisht basapa netaa aarake choudhary the, jinhen sipaahi rashid ahamed or choudhary ke nijee rakshak lalchand kii dekharekh main bachaa kar laae the
 The mlas hiding in the rooms were instructed by Lalchand to lock the doors from inside and they had just closed the doors so that a mob from the crowd roamed the corridor and started banging the door
 mayawati ko do kanishtha police afasaron himmat ne bachaaya
 These were Vijay Bhushan, the House Officer (SHO) at Hazratganj station, and Subhash Singh Baghel, who was the SHO (VIP), who took some of the soldiers along and pushed back the crowd with great difficulty
 phir ve sab galiyare main kataribaddh hokar khadey ho gaye taaki koi bhi unhen paar na kar sake
 The angry mob still kept shouting slogans and abusing and threatened to drag Mayawati out
 kuch police afasaron kii is sahaspurn or samayik kaarywahi ke alaava, zyaadaatar upasthit adhikariyon ne jinamein rajya atithi grih main sanchaalak or suraksha karmchaaree bhi shaamil the, is puure paagalpan ko rokane kii koi koshish nahin kii
 This all went on for over an hour
 kai basapa vidhayakon or kuch police adhikariyon ke ye bayaan stambhit karne vaale the ki jab vidhayakon ko apharan kiya ja rahaa tha or mayawati ke kamaron ke akraman ho rahaa tha, us samay vahaan lakhanu ke senior suprintedent of police opi singh bhi maujuud the
 According to eyewitnesses, they were just standing and blowing cigarettes
 akraman shuru hone ke turant baad rahasyatmak dhang se, atithi grih kii bijli or pani kii supplai kaat di gai-prashasan kii mileebhagat kaa ek or sanket
 The situation there improved only after the District Magistrate of Lucknow arrived there
 unhone krodhit bheed kaa dat kar muqabla karne kii himmat or jaagrukta kaa parichay diya
 The District Magistrate, together with SP Rajiv Ranjan, first pushed the members of the mob outside the confines of the guest house, who were not mlas
 baad main police ke atirikt bal sanghathanon ke aane par unhone sapa ke vidhayakon samet sabhi ko rajya atithi-grih ke daayre ke baahar nikalava diya
 However, to do so, he had to resort to the lathi charge of the mlas
 phir bhi sapa ke vidhansabha sadasyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi na karne kii mukhyamantri ke karyaalay se mili chetavanee ko ansuni karke ve apane faisle par date rahe
 The transfer order was issued to the District Magistrate with immediate effect after 11 o'clock at night, as a result of not doing his duty without fear and favor
 tippaniyan As more and more defense teams started reaching the Governor's office, the central government and senior BJP leaders interfered, the situation inside the guest house was controlled
 jab rakshakon ne building ke andar or baahar kabja kar liya tab gaaliyaan, dhamkiyaan or naare lagaati hui bheed dhire-dhire kam hoti chali gai
 Mayawati and her group of party mlas who had locked themselves inside the room set 1-2, had to make repeated requests to the District Magistrate and other officials to make sure that the threat was averted, and they opened the door
 Could jab unhone darwaja kholaa, tab tak kaaphi raat ho chuki thi
 Since then, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh's relationship deteriorated
 uske baad se 24 saal tak donon dalon ke bich naa to chunaav purv or naa hi chunaav ke baad koi gathbandhan hua he
 It remains to be seen whether the hostility caused by the guest house scandal in the SP-BSP changes
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki bramhadatt dvivedi sangh ke sevak the or unhen lathi chalaani bhi bakhubi aati thi isliye wo ek lathi lekar hathiyaaron se las gundon se bhid gaye the
 This is the reason that Mayawati too always considered him her elder brother and never pitched her candidate against him
 puure rajya main mayawati bijepi kaa virodh karti raheen, lekin farrukhabad main bramhadatt dvivedi ke liye prachaar karti thim
 It is said that when the goons later shot and killed Brahmadutt Dwivedi, Mayawati went to her house and wept bitterly
 unki vidhwaa ne jab chunaav ladaa tab mayawati ne unke khilaaf koi ummidavaar nahin utaara balki logon se apil kii thi ki meri jaan bachaane ke liye dushmani mol lekar shahid hone vaale mere bhai kii vidhwaa ko vot den
 According to some reports, he (samajwadi Party mlas, activists and mob) was using vulgar language and abusive language
 kaaman haul main baithe vidhayakon (bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak) ne jaldi se mukhya dwaar band kar diya, parantu jhund ne use todakar khol diya
 Then they cracked down on the helpless BSP mlas and started slapping and thrashing them
 bataaya jaataa he ki kam-se-kam paanch basapa vidhayakon ko ghasitate hue jabardasti atithi grih ke baahar le jaakar gadiyon main daalaa gaya tha, jo unhen mukhyamantri ke nivas sthaan par le gaye
 These mlas were asked to sign and sign an oath to join the BSP rebel group led by Raj Bahadur and to support the Mulayam Singh government on a paper
 unamem se kuch to itane dar gaye the ki unhone kore kaagaj par hi dastakhat kar die
 The mlas were kept captive there for much of the night, at which time the BSP mlas were being held in the extreme house in such a way as to take the chickens to the butchers, in front of the set 1-2 of the rooms, Where Mayawati was sitting with some mlas
 ek vicitra naatak ghatit ho rahaa tha, baahar kii bheed se kuch-kuch vidhayak batch kar nikal aae the or unhone unheen kamaron me chhipane ke liye sharan le lee thi
 The last senior BSP leader to come in was RK Chaudhary, who was rescued under the supervision of constable Rashid Ahmed and Chaudhary's personal guard Lalchand
 kamaron main chhipe vidhayakon ko lalchand ne darvaaj andar se lock karne kii hidaayat di or unhone abhi daravaaje band hi kiye the ki bheed main se ek jhund galiyare main dhaddhadata hua ghusaa or darwaja peetane laga
 Mayawati was rescued by two junior police officers Himmat
 ye the vijay bhushan, jo hajratganj stesan ke house afasar (esechao) the or subhash singh baghel jo esechao (viipi) the, jinhone kuch sipaahiyon ko saath le kar badi mushkil se bheed ko peeche dhakela
 Then they all stood in queue in the corridor so that no one could cross them
 krodhit bheed ne phir bhi naare lagaana or gaaliyaan dena chaalu rakhaa or mayawati ko ghaseet kar baahar laane kii dhamkee detii rahi
 Apart from this courageous and timely action of some police officers, most of the officers present, including the handlers and security staff at the state guest house, made no attempt to stop the madness
 yah sab ek ghante se zyada samay tak chalata rahaa
 The statements of several BSP mlas and some police officers were shocking that while senior mlas of Lucknow OP Singh were also present at the time when the mlas were being kidnapped and Mayawati's rooms were under attack
 chashmadidon ke anusaar ve sirf khadey hue cigarette phoonk rahe the
 Immediately after the invasion began, the guest house's electricity and water supplies were cut off - another sign of the administration's collusion
 lakhanu ke jila magistrate ke vahaan pahunchane ke baad hi vahaan ki paristhiti main sudhaar aayaa
 He showed the courage and awareness of combating the angry mob
 espi rajeev ranjan ke saath milakar jila magistrat ne sabase pehle bheed ke un sadasyon ko atithigrih ke daayre ke baahar dhakela, jo vidhayak nahin the
 Later on the arrival of additional force organizations of the police, he got all the SP mlas, including the mlas, out of the purview of the state super-house
 yadhyapi aisa karne ke liye unhe vidhayakon par lathicharge karne ke hukum kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Still, he ignored the warning received from the Chief Minister's office not to take action against the SP members of the Assembly, and he stood by his decision
 apni duty bina dare or pakshpaat na karne ke falswaroop raat ko 11 baje ke baad jila magistrate ke liye tatkaal prabhavi rup se tabadale kaa hukum jari kar diya gaya
 The comments jaise hi rajyapal ke karyaalay, centre sarkaar or varisht bhaajapa netaaon ke dakhal dete hi zyada se zyada raksha dal vahaan pahunchane lage, atithi grih ke andar kii sthiti niyantrit hoti gai
 When the defenders took in and out of the building, the crowd started shouting, shouting slogans, threats and slogans
 mayawati or unke party vidhayakon ke samooh ko jinhone apane aap ko kamare ke set 1-2 ke andar band kiya hua tha, yakeen dilaane ke liye jila magistrate or anya adhikariyon ko baar anurodh karnaa padaa ki ab khatra tal gaya tha, or ve darwaja khol sakate the
 By the time they opened the door, it had been quite a night
 isi ke baad se mivati or mulaayam singh ke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Since then, there has been no alliance between the two parties neither pre-election nor post-election for 24 years

 The situation there improved only after the District Magistrate of Lucknow arrived there
 unhone krodhit bheed kaa dat kar muqabla karne kii himmat or jaagrukta kaa parichay diya
 The District Magistrate, together with SP Rajiv Ranjan, first pushed the members of the mob outside the confines of the guest house, who were not mlas

 Mayawati and her group of party mlas who had locked themselves inside the room set 1-2, had to make repeated requests to the District Magistrate and other officials to make sure that the threat was averted, and they opened the door
 Could jab unhone darwaja kholaa, tab tak kaaphi raat ho chuki thi
 Since then, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh's relationship deteriorated

 swami vivekanand ne yoga ko chaar mukhya dhaaraon main sutarabaddh kiya tha
 First, jnana yoga which teaches how to assimilate knowledge
 doosraa, raaj yoga jo ichhashakti ko badhaata he
 Third, Bhakti yoga or the science of emotions
 chauthaa, karm yoga yaa karm kaa rasta
 The form of Jnana Yoga is experimental, not blind faith, but by its design it is curious or questionable
 asal main aadhunik vigyaan or gyaan yoga milte-julate hai, kyonki donon hi buniyadi hakeekat kii khoj ke tareeke hai
 Raj Yoga means changing on the strength of your will, increasing and becoming a good human being
 patanjali ne raaj yoga ke aath charan batalaaye hai
 The total meaning of Bhakti Yoga is to divine feelings and gain control over them
 karm yoga dainik karmon ko yoga main badalata he—chaahe vah khaanaa pakaana ho, khaanaa ho yaa likhnaa
 All these different forms of yoga have the same goal - to achieve perfection and to elevate oneself to a higher level of consciousness
 meraa mishan yoga ke in tamaam roopon ko maanav gatividhiyon ke tamaam kshetron main lagu karnaa or is prakriya main samaaj ko zyada oonche str par le janaa he
 Yoga can give direction to modern science and technology and can take things beyond and beyond this physical world to understand the subtle dimensions of the universe
 asal main yoga or aadhunik vigyaan ek duusare ke poorak hai
 i learned this from one of the youngest Nobel laureates — scientist Brian Josephson — who won the award at the age of 29
 saat saal pehle ve landan main yoga par mere ek vyaakhyaan main shariq hone aae the
 After the program was over he told me that he used to do regular yoga
 main unke ghar gaya or yah dekhakar sukhad aashcharya main pad gaya ki unke yahaan vigyaan kii kitabon ke saath-saath yoga par kitaaben or upanishad rakhe hue the
 He told me that he taught him to go beyond quantum physics and mathematics
 phir ve ek saal kaa adhyayan avkaash lekar bangaluru ke bhartiya vigyaan santhaan main guest professor ke taur par bharat aae or yahaan unhone mantrocchar, dhyaan, asana or pranayam karnaa siikhaa
 In the Ministry of AYUSH, we are doing research to prove Yoga as a complete preventive diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes
 asal main yah shodh takreeban puraa ho chukaa he
 We are planning similar research for high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, back pain, mental disorders, insomnia, obesity and other diseases
 yah yoga ko kai kism kii bimariyon ke liye vaigyanik or roganirodhak upaay ke taur par sthapit kar degaa
 Our research is based on vast data
 diabetes ke liye hamane 60 jilon main faile 2,50,000 logon kii chaanbin kii or paaya ki unamem se 50,000 ko diabetes thi
 He was taught yoga and after three months his health was seen to improve drastically
 jinhen badtareen kism kii diabetes thi, unke rakt sharkara ke str main baari giravat dekhi gai, jabaki jinhen halki str kii diabetes thi, ve bhale-change ho gaye
 One of our achievements in AYUSH is that we have prepared a common yoga protocol after consulting experts
 yah 45 minute kaa vidhi-vidhaan he jisamen yoga, pranayam, dhyaan or bhakthi yoga he
 If done daily, it brings a significant change in the physical and mental skills of the person
 agar hamaari 70 fisadi aabaadi niyamit taur par asana or pranayam karne lage, to desh ke swasthya bajet main khaasi kami aa jaaegi, kyonki yah bimariyon kii rokthaam kaa kaam karegaa
 The good health of the nation can play a big role in making India the number one country in the world
 baba ramdev, shri shri ravishankar tathaa kai dusron sareekhe mahaan yoga guru yoga ko logon ke bade tabakon kii rosemara kii jindagi kaa hissaa banane kaa mahati kaam kar rahe hai
 India and indeed the whole world should be grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that on June 21, International Yoga Day could be declared by his efforts
 agar yoga antarrashtriya str par jindagi jeene kaa tarika ban jaataa he, to duniya bhar main swasthya ke bajet ghat jaaenge or inasaaniyat chetana ke zyada oonche str par pahunch jaaegi

 On November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the closure of old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees, there was a wind of cashlessness
 isi bayaar main madhya pradesh ke ek gaanv ko sabase pehla 'cashles gaanv' qaraar diya gaya tha
 a big program was organized to announce this
 lekin notebandi ke ek saal baad is gaanv main bhi desh ke anya bhaagon kii tarah hi cash hi raja he
 In every transaction cash, a team from India Today visited this village named Barjhira, located 30 km from Bhopal
 is dauraan pataa chalaa ki notebandi ke ek saal baad yahaan har lenden cash main ho rahaa he
 The effect of being a cashless village does not have any effect here
 hue the bade aayojananotbandike baad madhya pradesh sarkaar ne badzira ko pehla cashles gaanv ghoshit kiya tha
 a big event was organized for this
 rajya sarkaar ne bank of badoda ke saath milakar yahaan kai kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya
 These included showing POS machines and other cashless transactions, how it has become the first cashless village in the state after demonetisation
 lekin ab nahin dikhti pioes mashinelekin ek saal baad kii tasviir bilkul alag he
 All the POS machines that were shown during the announcement of being cashless are now not visible anywhere
 yahaan har kaarobaari lenden ab nagad main ho rahaa he
 Anil Tilak, a village businessman, explains that the bank went back with POS machines a few weeks after the cashless village was declared
 kuch kaarobaariyon ne khud hi in mashiinon ko waapas lautaa diya
 Because people started doing cashless transactions very rarely
 ab kuch logon ke paas hi hai pioes mashineyinil ne bataaya ki ab sirf bade kaarobaari hi pioes mashine rakhte hai
 He said that no one does cashless transactions anymore
 pioes mashiinon kaa rakhane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 The disorder has led to many reasons behind the lack of interest in cashless transactions in interesting cashless transactions
 yahaan bank of badoda kii taraf se lagi atm bhi hafton tak kharaab rahati he
 Apart from this, villagers also have to pay extra charge for cashless transactions
 iskaa sabase zyada asar padaa kisaanon par
 Those who are being paid through checks and RTGS payments, but have to buy everything by paying cash
 lenaa pad rahaa he karjagaanv ke kisaan shailendra bataate hai ki gaanv main ab har lenden nagad main hota he, lekin dukh is baat kaa he ki hamen jo bhugtan kiya jaataa he, vah check ke jariye hota he
 Due to this, we have to take loans for sowing and harvesting the crop
 cashles lenden kii vajah se hamen kaaphi dikkatein pesh aa rahi hai
 'nothing gained from demonetisation' is the condition of the village traders
 unka kahana he ki notebandi se kuch bhi hasil nahin hua
 Businessman Rohit Sen says, "most of the time women used to keep cash in their house
 is nagdi se kai jaruri kaam nipat jate the, lekin notebandi ne vah nagdi puri tarah se chin lee he
 With this, demonetisation was introduced to catch black money, but that too was not completed
 is tarah notebandi puri tarah fail sabit hui he
 "cashless transactions subsided only a few days after demonetisation," according to the villagers, when this village was declared a cashless village after demonetisation
 uske kuch hafton tak hi cashles gaanv kii dhaaran bani rahi or kuch din tak logon ne cashles lenden kiya bhi
 But it remained for a few days
 uske baad sabhi log phir nagdi main lenden karne lage
 Sarerah firing was carried out on the sons of Haryana Police Inspector in Noida on Sunday evening

 Investigation report is sought from the CO in 2 days
 marane vaale kii pahachanarohtak nivasee ejeeniyar sachin sangwan ke rup main hui he
 In his car, he was going to Gaur City apartment in Greater Noida West and when he reached near NTPC crossing, he was attacked by motorcyclists
 police ne bataaya ki sangwan kichaati main goli lagijabaki tarun ke haath main goli lagi he
 - input language dharm kii hi tarah deshprem bhi vyanntigat bhav he jo bahut antarang rup se abhivyakt hota he or isiilie dharm kii hi tarah alag-alag logon ke liye iske alag-alag arth hote hai
 Like religion, it can also be stimulating
 deshprem ek komal bhav he or meraa maananaa he ki cinema main iskaa bahut saavdhaanee se istemaal hona chahie
 The first patriotic film i saw was Kranti (1981)
 hairaani kii baat he ki ise dekh kar mujhamen deshprem jaisaa koi bhav nahin jaagaa
 At that time i was very young and i think in childhood we do not watch movies with the intention of taking a philosophical sense
 us daur main film dekhnaa anand ke aantarik anubhav jaisaa hota he jiskaa aap par baad main jab aap bade ho jate hai, tab asar hota he
 When i was growing up, the patriotism was very different at that time
 udhaaharan ke liye hamaare bachapan ke bade hisse main aisi filmon ke khalanaayak aupniveshik shaasha, mughal yaa british hote the
 We used to learn similar things from school books and movies
 or peeche jate hue '50 yaa '60 ke dashak kii filmein dekhte hue mujhe koshish karke unke sandarbhon ko yaad rakhana padataa he
 We had got freedom at that time
 ek desh ke rup main ham khadey hone kii koshish kar rahe the
 Our economy was in its early stages
 'mere desh kii dharti' or 'i mere vatan ke logo' jaise geet logon ke dilon kii dhadkan ban gaye the kyonki ve ek khaas iraade se—logon main aatmbodh kaa bhav bharne ke liye—likhe gaye the
 Films have a very symbiotic relationship with society
 donon ek-duusare se sikhte hai
 it happens
 filmein hamaare samay ko darshaati hai or badale main samaaj bhi filmon se bahut si baton ko sokhta he
 Therefore, Amitabh Bachchan's' angry young man 'personality became popular when the problems of mill workers were in the headlines during our economic development in the' 70s
 filmein jo baat karti hai, uskaa us kaal se bahut judaav hota he jisamen ve bani hoti hai
 The patriotism in cinema also takes shape partly according to the sensitivity of the film and its producers
 udhaaharan ke liye lagaan (2001) ko lijie
 The British rulers were clearly enemies in this, but the villagers were also fighting their poverty
 ve sookhe se bhi lard rahe the
 When he wins a cricket match in the final part of the film, the reason for his happiness is not only that he defeated the British but also includes the pleasure of defeating their adversities
 unka gaurav maanviya bhaavana kaa prakatikaran he
 His achievement is to get a chance to shine to someone considered insignificant and insignificant
 mere liye lagaan sirf desh prem dikhaane vaali film nahin thi
 It was a story of people's courage
 jab maine raji (2018) par kaam shuru kiya to lekhan, chhayankan, nirmaan tathaa sampadan kii prakriyaaon se guzarate hue mere dimag main kabhi yah khyaal nahin aayaa ki main koi deshbhaktipurna film bana rahi hum
 For me, the film was a story of intractable human spirit, perseverance, and the futility of war
 jab hamane film ko pehali baar puri tarah sanyojit kiya, tab mahasoos kiya ki yah film to or bhi bahut kuch kah rahi he
 If you pay attention, you will not see the Indian flag anywhere in Raazi
 na hi, puri film main kahin pashrv prishthbhumi ke rup main raashtragan yaa 'vande maataram' kaa gayan sunai padegaa
 i intended to show a story of true perseverance
 main isse deshbhakti kaa paath nahin padhaanaa chaahati thi
 The thing that drew me towards its main character Sahayata (alia Bhatt) was that anyone like him was ever present in this world
 meri najar main yah charitra ek adarsh tha, ek prerana thi
 Looking at him, you can develop deep satisfaction and a sense of elevation
 main uski sachhee kahani ko dikhaanaa chaahati thi
 It is a coincidence that when people started watching the film and the critics started writing reviews, the meanings with which we went with it also opened up further connotations
 yah aisi film ke rup main ubhari jo desh prem ko ek alag nazariye se pesh karti thi
 It can be seen that you can be patriotic even without resorting to radical nationalist expressions
 ham jab sahamat ke pakistani parivaar ke charitron kaa lekhan kar rahe the to hamane shaayad anjaane main hi sunishchit kar diya tha ki unka vyavhaar, kriyaayein or nirnay rashtravaadi prabhaav se sanchalit na hon
 That is why when you see Sushma in front of these Pakistani characters, she looks like a villain
 vahi he jo puure parivaar ko barbaad karne main lagi he
 But as soon as you take care of the reasons for which she is doing this, then suddenly the negativity of the feelings towards her ends
 use prerit karne vaale karkon ko hataate hi vah phir prati-nayika lagane lagati he na ki uskaa pakistani parivaar
 The challenge in itself was to prove Moht to be morally justified while keeping the 'enemy side' humane
 jaraa bhi kisi ore jhukate hi yah santulan bahut kharaab ho saktaa tha
 Emotionality does not bother me very much, but when the snout starts circling in the form of an emotion, the inner bell rings
 agar main film main sahamat kii deshbhakti kaa chithran kar rahi hum, to mujhe uske pati ikbaal ke uske desh ke prati pyaar ke bare main bhi bolnaa chahie
 Why should one be patriotic at the cost of another? If we have a patriotism with us, we should also accept the patriotism of others
 mere hisaab se mujhe apane desh se pyaar karne ke liye kisi duusare desh se nafrat karne kii jarurat nahin he
 In the end, intention is the thing that matters most
 hamane jab talwaar (2015) banaai thi to ham kisi tarah ke vivaad main nahin funsana chaahate the
 We only wanted to bring the two sides of the story to the fore because we felt that the news that we had about it was unbalanced
 hamaare paas koi samaadhaan nahin tha
 We just wanted to keep all the information in front
 yah aapkaa iraadaa hi he, jo mujhe lagata he ki sabko dikhaai padataa he
 In this sense, depiction of patriotism is exactly the same
 deshbhakti ke mere chithran chaahe jitne bhi nishcesht hon, un par mere iraade kaa prabhaav hota he
 For me, my country means my people, my city and my environment
 nishchay hi yah koi vichaardhaara nahin he
 i do not have to have a tricolor made on my face to express my love for my country
 meraa maananaa he ki agar main khud ko apane kaam main dubo luun to main thodaa bahut kuch aisa saamne laa sakati hum jisase is raashtra ko behatar banane main madad mil sake
 i cannot hoist the flag or raise slogans
 mujhe apni filmon yaa apane jivan main apni deshbhakti sabit karne kii jarurat nahin honi chahie
 i shouldn't even be asked to do this
 meghna gulzaar film nirmaataa hai

 The state government has said that farmers who are burdened with debt will get an exemption of up to Rs 1
5 lakh
 jabaki eemaandaaree se karz chukaane vaale kisaanon ko 25 hajaar rupee yaa unke karz ke 25 fisadi rakam main se jo kam he vah bonus diya jayega
 Abhay Chavan, who is part of a group of farmers who have come to meet Sharad Pawar, told NDTV India that this has given rise to a feeling among honest farmers that they have been treated unfairly
 hamane teen lakh tak kaa karz chukaaya he
 We will get a bonus of 25 thousand

 In such a situation, we demand that the bonus amount should be increased from 50 thousand to 1
5 lakh
 tippaniyan Sensing this attitude of the farmers, the opposition has now started opposing the conditions of loan waiver

 north emsidi main congress dal ke netaa mukesh goyal ne monsoon se pehle naalon kii safai or barsaati pani kii nikasi ke sambandh main emsidi kii ore se kii gai taiyaariyon par di gai jaankaree par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 He said that the information given by the commissioner is far from the reality
 goyal ne bataaya ki unhone saal 2018-19 ke liye banaae gaye ection plan kii jaankaree maangi thi lekin vibhaag ne saal 2017-18 kii jaankaree di
 Apart from this, Mukesh Goyal also accused the PWD department of Delhi government that the government is not serious about the monsoon and the drains have not been cleaned under it till now
 aadha bhi nahin hua naalon kii safai kaa kamgoyal ke anusaar rajdhani dilli main monsoon aane ko he lekin nagar nigam kii ore se monsoon se nibatane kii koi taiyaari nahin kii gai he
 Goyal alleged that the work of cleaning the drains in the North MCD has not been completed even till half
 is kaam ke liye emsidi ke paas na to paryaapt sansaadhan hai or na hi staff, iske baavjood emsidi monsoon se nibatane kii taiyaariyon ko lekar bade- bade daawey kar rahi he
 Mukesh said that according to the information given by North MCD Commissioner Madhup Vyas, MCD does not have machines nor suction and jet machines are available for cleaning big drains
 aise main andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki emsidi dvaaranaalon kii safyeekis prakaar kii ja rahi hogi
 He has demanded that action should be taken against the officials of DAMS and engineering department who are giving wrong information
 unhone kaha ki emsidi kii mul jimmedaari safai karnaa he jise puraa karne main to wo naakaam he hi, naalon kii safai ko lekar bhi emsidi gambhir nahin he
 At the same time, PWD department of Delhi government has not yet cleaned the drains under it, while the major drains of Delhi come under PWD
 jinamein emsidi ke chote naalon kaa ganda pani coloniyon se nikal kar jaataa he lekin bade naalon kii safai na hone ke kaaran chote naalon kaa ganda pani aage nahin ja paata or natijatan ganda pani coloniyon kii sadakon or galiyon main bhar jaataa he
 Goyal has demanded from the MCD that machines and other equipment for cleaning be purchased from the amount of Urban Development Funds received from the Central Government and funds for cleanliness under the Swachh Bharat Mission of Modi Government
 jiesti council kii aagaamee baithkon se pehle dilli sarkaar ne vyapaariyon kii jaruraton ko samajhane ke liye alag-alag vyapaarik sanghathanon ke saath vichaar-vimarsh shuru kar diya he
 Due to this, a seminar was organized with the Paper Merchant Association on Monday
 up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne seminar main vyapaariyon ko bataaya ki jiesti council kii baithkon main ek-ek product par charchaa honi chahie
 It should also be discussed what are the advantages and disadvantages of placing such and such product in which slab
 hamane apane bajet main koi tex nahin badhaayaa, balki kai product par hamane tex kam kiye
 Now that the GST is implemented, the decision will be at the national level, but we will keep the emphasis from Delhi that the minimum tax remains, because keeping the maximum tax will be theft and bribery will increase, the earnings of the inspectors, who will be both the merchant and the customer
 It will be heavy
 paper marchent association ne suzav diya he ki sabhi prakaar ke paper va board ko jiesti kii 12 pratishat kii category main rakhaa jaae
 As of now, educational books and copies are not taxed
 iske alaava input output kaa diference cariforward hona chahie
 Also, in Delhi, the taxability of the tax should be that of the seller's merchant

 The controversy of Sandeep Kumar was not even cold yet that MLA Devendra Sehrawat's accusatory letter on Sanjay Singh has raised the concerns of the leaders
 sanjay sinhane press conference ke dauraan kaha ki devendra seharaavat ke aarope bebuniyaad hai or wo unke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa karenge
 Counting the allegations against Sanjay Singh himself, he said that when the movement of Anna ji started, it was alleged that i have made a BPL card
 iske baad asif mohammad khan ne mere upar bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya
 But that news turned out to be false
 phir 3 se 4 din pehle mere upar ek raily main 5 lakh rupye lene kaa aarope lagaaya
 And now for the fourth time, without proof, Devendra Sehrawat is alleging that he exploited women
 ''bijepi akali dal kii sajeesh'sanjay singh neam aadmi partike vijawasan vidhansabha se vidhayak devendra saharaavat se sawaal poocha or virdohi dalon par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki 'devendra seharaavat ne party se 3 baar chunaav ladaa he

 maamla mere charitra se judaa he, isliye devendra saharaavat ke upar manahani kaa cese karunga
 Admittedly, he is an MLA of our party but it is not right to make allegations without proof

 The people of Punjab will take revenge when the time comes
 'prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav par lagaae aaropis bich sanjay singh ne apane puraane saathi prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav kaa naam lete hue ye aarope lagaaya ki unke nishkasana ke baad, devendra seharaavat lagaataar party ke khilaaf kaam kaa rahe hai
 After this Yogendra Yadav responded on Twitter and wrote that 'this party whose leaders wanted to abolish the defamation law till tomorrow, is defaming its own MLA today! Why brother? iske baad sanjay singh ne twit kiya 'to kya aam party main jo bhi sach bolegaa use swaraj abhiyaan kaa sipaahi or hamaara saathi bataa diya jayega? acha he phir to!'
 In response to this, Devendra Sehrawat tweeted that 'I wrote two letters with full responsibility, i still stand by it and will stay till the end
 ' Rajan said, 'I want to apologize to the class whom i have hurt with my words and they are blind
 ' bharat ke 'aakarshak gantavy' hone ke sambandh main unki raay poochne par rajan ne pichley saptaah ek saakshaatkaar main kaha tha, 'mujhe lagata he ki abhi aisi jagah pahunchnaa baaki he, jahaan ham santusht mahasoos karen

 After the revelation of Aaj Tak, the Rajasthan government has canceled all the centers making fake Aadhaar cards in Jaipur
 iske baar main alag-alag thanon main chaar exiaar bhi darj kiye gaye hai
 The government has also constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the entire matter
 gauratlab he ki ajtak ne yah khulaasa kiya tha ki kis tarah se jaipur ke kai aadhaar centre 500 se 600 rupee main bina kisi dastovaj ke aadhaar card bana rahe hai
 Aadhaar was started to establish a strong identity of every citizen of the country
 chaahe mobile conection lenaa ho yaa rashan yaa phir exam main baithna ho, bhartiya hone kii pahchaan ke liye sarkaar ne aadhaar number anivaary kar diya he
 It was also considered as a strong base for internal security of the country
 magar aise farji kendron kii vajah se sawaal khadaa hota he ki kya vaaki aadhaar desh kaa aadhaar he yaa phir aadhaar yojana niraadhaar ban chuki he? ajtak ke sting main yah chaunkaane vaali khabar lagi ki bangladeshi nagarikon ho yaa rohingya musalmaan hi kyon na aa jaaen, bina kisi dastovaj ke sabhi bharat ke naagarik banate ja rahe hai
 It was a shameful thing for the security of the country
 ye he puri sting kii kahaniapaki jaankaree ke liye ham yahaan sting kii story ko phir se saamne rakh rahe hai, isse aapako puraa andaja ho jayega ki kuch log chand paison kii khatir kis tarah se desh kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad kar rahe hai
 When an acquaintance of ours told that the Aadhaar card is coming to his house, i asked if the Aadhaar cards are made at the center set up for this, to which he said that the center will go, make the house in 24 hours for three hundred rupees
 Will go
 yah sunakar hamen yakeen nahin hua ki jo aadhaar number har bhartiya kii pahchaan he, uski teen sau rupye main home dilvari ho rahi he
 He showed us a message that said to contact us to get an Aadhaar card made
 hamane die hue number par kol kiya to us vyakti ne hamen jaipur ke jagatpura puliya ke neeche ek photo state kii dukaan main bulaayaa
 When we reached there, people were already standing there to get Aadhaar numbers made
 bengal se ai ek yuvati or bihar se aayaa ek baccha bhi aadhaar card banavaane aayaa tha, jinke paas koi document nahi tha, magar unka aadhaar card ban rahaa tha
 This view was scary
 bina kisi dastavej ke koi bhi 500-600 rupee kharch kar bharat kaa naagarik ban rahaa tha
 The easiest job of this country seemed to be taking citizenship of the country
 hamane baatcheet kii shuruyaat photo state dukaan ke maalik se kii kyonki vahi paise le rahaa tha
 The shop owner taking the money at the counter said about the person making the card, that the rate of the card will tell the same without any document
 reporter- ye hamaare parichit hai, inke paas koi document nahi he, kitna charge lagegaa?agent- iske liye unase sampark karo
 Its rate will tell the same
 phir uski satyata kii jaanch ke liye hamane aage sawaal kiya
 Reporter - what is the guarantee of getting it made here, the card does not come? Agent- You can get it out of the net
 reporter- lekin kya guarantee he sahi banegaa?agent- main yahi hum, meraa ghar he, meraa rigstrishan he
 Reporter - But this is not an Authorized Center
 agent- lekin ye mashin to athoraiced he
 Otherwise why would i do such a thing for two pennies
 izzat kharaab kyon karuunga, bahut kaam he koi bhi aakar bol jayega
 i do not do wrong things
 mere paas isiilie dur-dur se log aate hai, kyonki main bataa detaa hum ki kya galat he or kya sahi he or kaam karne kaa kya upaay he
 600 for a document basis without this
 After this we asked him if he would come to our house and make it
 usne poocha kitne log ho jaaenge
 We told him to be lured to 10-15
 iske baad wo 15 kimi
 The city of Vaishali also agreed to come
 phir hamane poocha ki kya bina document kaa nayaa card banavaa denge
 He said yes to tapak, but will make 600 rupees
 reporter- bina document ke 600 rupee or vaise sirf 100 rupegent- haa itani dur se aauungaa, tel bhi kharch hoga, time bhi kharaab karuunga
 Reporter - Where do you live? agent -bassi se aata humreporter- to isko bassi main feed karoge
 Agent- Commissioner- Your center is in Bassi, Agent- Not the center, i work in camp mode
 hamen yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki bina kisi document ke aadhaar card ban saktaa he
 We asked him again for his comfort
 uske baad hamane uski aadhaar se judi pahchaan maangi to usne apane mobile par aadhaar kii bebsite kholkar apni puri pahchaan dikhaai
 The next day, they took the whole system to 25 km
 me dur vaishali nagar main hamaare bataae jagah par pahunch gaya
 After coming there, he set up his whole system of base building and started building the base
 pehle maine khud bina kisi dacument die use pataa change karne ke liye kaha or uske baad ek vyakti ko bina document kaa card banavaane ke liye kaha or vah banane laga
 After earning two or three Aadhaar cards, he started to open easily and we started talking to him
 reporter- tumhaara aadhaar se kya link he?agent- matlabareporter- tum aadhaar se kaise jude ho, koi card mila he tumhen?agent- haa bana he
 
 certificate mila he hamen, ghar par he
 
 
 Is in the shop
 
 
 jab registration miltaa he tabhi hamen miltaa he
 Only opens with our thumb
 reporter- din main kitna bana lete ho
 
 20-30 card?agent- nahin ab kahaan
 Earlier, we used to make delis up to 100
 reporter- tab to 10 hajaar roj kama lete the
 Agent- Where, the company has to pay even further
 reporter- koun si company he?agent- acharya
 
 reporter- ye koun si company he
 Agent- Registration of the same company
 reporter-to abhi le rahe ho 100-150 or 600 to kitna company ko doge
 If there is a shortage in the document, then the company asks for it
 koi kami rahati he to paise maangate hai
 Reporter - How do you show those who have no documents? Agent - We do that
 
 Let's do jugaad 
 He was not in the mood to answer more of our questions
 magar hamen aadhaar card banavaane main ruchi nahin thi
 We were trying to know how this deal is going on with the security of the country for a few rupees
 ham bangladeshiyon ke card banavaane kii baat karte to use shaq ho jaataa, isliye hamane usee ilaake ke apane driver ko sawaal poochne ke liye apane paas baitha liya
 The driver asked- giving your contract number, we have 10-15 Bangladeshis
 usne kaha thik he
 It was clear that he was ready to go anywhere and make a card for anyone in the greed for money
 phir aage kii baat hamane sanbhali
 Reporter - two or three Bengali acquaintances have come, all together will become 10-20
 kisi kaa document nahi he, to us hisaab se bataao kya loge
 Agent - i will not take less than 500 rupees per person
 reporter- dacument nahin he to kya dikhaogeegent- wo hamaara hedek he
 After this, we made cards of many such people
 darasal jinka document nahi hota he, unka ye farji kiraayanama or shapath patr banaakar adress pruf khud hi banavaa dete hai or card bana dete hai
 Apart from this, we talked to many other agents and all agreed to make fake documents and Aadhaar cards without any documents by taking money
 hamaare camere main is tarah ke kai agent kaid hai, jo aadhaar card banane kaa farjivada kar rahe hai
 In this way, the fake game of Aadhaar fraud is going on and the Rajasthan government including UID is sleeping
 abhi ek saptaah pehle hi jabarohingya musalamaanon kipahchan kaa mudda uthaa to jaanch ke baad rajasthan sarkaar ke intelligence ne report saunpi he ki is baat kaa pataa lagaaya jaae ki gaiyrkanoonee dhang se rah rahe videshiyon ke sabhi dacument kaise bane hai
 i wish the Intelligence Department would have done the investigation instead of writing to the government
 jo kaam sarkaar or intelligence vibhaag nahi kar paa rahi he wo hamane karke dikhaaya he ki kaise farjivada kar kisi kaa bhi aadhaar card banaaya ja saktaa he

 co / mrjfwt1a39 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath dwaara ayodhya main sarayu nadi ke tat par bhagwaan ram kii 100 meter oonchi vishalkay murti sthapit karne ke faisle kaa vishwa hindu parishad ne dil kholkar swaagat kiya he
 CM Yogi has announced that he wants to build the tallest statue of Lord Rama Kiduniya on the banks of river Saryu in Ayodhya
 VHP ne kaha he ki upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii yojana agar jameen par utaarti he to isse desh main hi nahin balki puri duniya main ayodhya kaa gaurav badhegaa
 VHP spokesperson Vijay Shankar Tiwari said in Delhi on Tuesday, "if a grand temple of Lord Ram is built in Ayodhya, it will be a matter of happiness for the whole country
" isse ayodhya main or aasapaas ke ilaakon main paryaton badhegaa
 "it is noteworthy that the UP government is preparing to celebrate Diwali in Ayodhya this year in the same grand manner as the people of Ayodhya celebrated Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya by conquering Lanka
 upi ke CM yogi adityanath ke is prastaav ko lekar vivaad hona tay he, kyonki sarayu ke kinare jahaan bhagwaan ram kii murti lagaae jane kii baat kii ja rahi he, vah vivaadit sthal se kuch hi dur he
 This proposal of the Yogi government is also in the discussion, because the booklet published by the UP government on the tourist places of UP a few days ago, does not mention the world famous Taj Mahal
 vahiin VHP ke vijay shankar tiwari kaa kahana he, "tajmahal kii tulana bhagwaan ram se karnaa bilkul galat he, kyonki bhagwaan ram karodon logon kii aasthaa ke pratik hai or ayodhya unki janm sthali he
 "questions are also being raised about this proposal of the UP government because many children died due to lack of oxygen in a hospital in Gorakhpur just a few months ago, there was a lot of controversy
 ab yah sawaal bhi uthaaya ja rahaa he ki kya sarkaar ke liye aspataalon ke rakrakhaav se zyada jaruri murti banvaanaa he?is par VHP kaa kahana he ki aspataalon main agar koi kami rah gai he to upi kii sarkaar ko use bhi dur karnaa chahie, lekin aspataalon kii behatari kaa ayodhya main ram mandir mudde se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, kyonki sarkaar ke prashasnic kaam or saamaajik kaam alag-alag hote hai

 Thank you for having me @gqindia @ritssajdeha photo posted by @ rohitsharma45 on Sep 27, 2015 at 7:16 am PDT film 'begum jaan' kii kahani he hindustan or pakistan ke bantwaare ke samay kii, jahaan border ke bichombich ek kothaa aa jaataa he or us kothe ko todane ke aadesh aate hai
 Begum Jaan is the mistress of this brothel who does not want to evacuate it because this 'begum Jaan' has supported many destitute and persecuted girls from society
 begum jaan kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai, vidya baalan
 Apart from Vidya, actors like Ila Arun, Gauhar Khan, Ashish Vidyarthi, Rajat Kapoor, Vivek Mushran, Chunky Pandey and Naseeruddin Shah played important roles in this film
 srijith mukherjee nirdeshit film 'begum jaan' bangla film 'raaj kahini' kaa rimek he, jise srijith ne hi banaaya tha
 'begum Jaan' describes one of the many pains during the partition between two countries at the time of independence
 yah film 'begum jaan' naam kii ek mahila kii bahaduree kii kahani kahati he jise bantwaare yaa aazaadee se koi fark nahin padataa, bas vah apana ghar sahi salaamat chaahati he, jahaan usne kai besahaara ladakiyon ko sahaara dekar apane parivaar kaa sadsy banaaya he or kothaa chalaati hai
 The film has some good dialogues
 kuch dard bhare gane hai
 There is also the misery of separation of two friends during the partition of the country
 tippaniyan Of course- Vidya Balan has given her life in the role of 'begum Jaan'
 film main kai drishy dil ko choote hai, lekin is film kii sabase badi kamazori he ki yah bahut hi laud he
 Entertainment is low
 zarurat se zyada drama creat kiya gaya he or zarurat se zyada dialogbaji he
 In many scenes, fights of coercion also appear as if the girls of the brothel are fighting among themselves while having food
 film main holi kaa gaanaa achaanak se kaise aa jaataa he samaj nahin aata
 The length of the film seemed to me to be a little too much
 film 'begum jaan' main sabase pehle drishy main darshaya gaya he ki 2016 main dilli main ek bas par kuch manachale gunde ek ladki par hamalaa karte hai, balaatkaar kii koshish karte hai or ek budhi mahila ajeebogareeb andaaz se use bachaati he or yahaan se film flashbek main jaati he, yani film yah bhi bataa rahi he ki jaise kal auraton par atyaachaar hote the vaise hi aaj bhi atyaachaar hote hai
 My rating for the film is 3 stars, with half the star starring Vidya Balan for her strong acting
 srijith mukherjee nirdeshit film 'begum jaan' bangla film 'raaj kahini' kaa rimek he, jise srijith ne hi banaaya tha

 My rating for the film is 3 stars, with half the star starring Vidya Balan for her strong acting
 beshak- 'begum jaan' kii bhoomika main vidya baalan ne jaan daal di he
 Many scenes in the film are heart touching, but the biggest weakness of this film is that it is very loud

 Yes, Jayanandan, accused of the blood of eight women, repeatedly runs away from jail
 mjedaar baat yah he ki har baar uske bhaagane kaa tarika behad anoothaa hota he
 Jayanandan once again escaped from the jail and Thiruvananthapuram police have unified him day and night to find him
 jayandann ek anya kaidi uppa prakaash ke saath jail todakar bhaag gaya
 To deceive the police, he left a dummy inside the jail cell to make it look like he was sleeping
 police kaa kahana he ki vah lohe ke kattar se cell kaa taala todakar bhaagane main safal rahaa
 Jayanandan is accused of killing eight women, but has been punished only in two cases
 is baar bhi jaynandan ne jail se bhaagane kaa anoothaa tarika dhund nikaala
 He started preparing for it long ago
 vah jail parisar main maujuud bans kii lakadiyaan or kapade ikattha karata rahata tha
 Then he made a rope with these things so that he could escape from the compound wall
 vah apane plan ke mutabik hi jail se bhaagane main kaamyaab rahaa
 Jayanandan has also escaped from jail before
 saal 2010 main jab vah kannur jail main band tha tab usne vahaan se baahar nikalne ke liye khub diating kii
 He starved for several days and then became so thin that he broke out of the prison bars without breaking the lock
 iske baad vah jail kii diwaar langhakar faraar ho gaya
 He was later arrested from Tamil Nadu, where he was staying with his wife
 isse pehle saal 2007 main bhi jaynandan ne jail main surang banaakar bhaagane kii koshish kii thi, lekin tab wo naakaam rahaa tha
