 pakistan jhooth bolne main kitna maahir he, ye puri duuniya jaanati he
 He himself proves by his antics that he does not like the truth
 ab ek baar phir pakistan kii sena ke pravaktaa ne khud yah pramaan diya he ki unki dharti par bharat ke khilaaf jitna jhooth bolaa jaataa he
 Fueled by India's action, Pakistan on Wednesday attempted to attack India in violation of the airspace
 pakistan ke teen aircraft elosi paar kar jab bhartiya seemaa main aae to unhen vayusena ne munhtod jawaab diya
 However, an Indian Air Force aircraft and a pilot went missing, chasing the Pakistan aircraft
 lekin pakistan ne daawa kiya ki bharat ke do payalat uski hiraasat main hai or bhartiya vayusena ke do vimaan maar giraae hai
 Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said that our plan was not to harm the Indian Army or civilians
 unhone kaha ki jab hamane apane target le liye to bhartiya vayusena ke do jahaaj line of control paar kar pakistan kii had main aa gaye, jin par pakistani vayusena ne atake kiya or unhen maar giraaya
 Asif Gafoor said that the debris of one of these two planes fell in the Pakistani border, while the other collapsed on the Indian border
 iske saath hi asif gafoor ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki do payalat ko hamaari sena ne hiraasat main le liya
 One of them was injured, who has been sent for treatment, and the other pilot is in our custody
 apane jhooth kaa kiya khulhasapakistani sena ke numaayinde ne ab badi besharmi se apane hi bayaan ko galat qaraar diya he

 unhone daawa kiya ki bhartiya payalat hamaari hiraasat main he or unke saath military niyamon ko dhyaan rakhte hue bartaav kiya ja rahaa he
 That is, on Wednesday afternoon, Asif Ghafur, in a video message, claimed to have detained two Indian pilots in front of the media, he proved himself to be hollow
 bataa den ki bhartiya videsh mantralay ne apane aadhikarik bayaan main ek payalat or ek vimaan ke laapata hone kii baat kahi thi, jiske baad pakistan ne apana bayaan badalte hue kaha ki unki hiraasat main ek hi payalat he

 Sri Lanka lost six wickets to reach the modest target of 232 runs from Afghanistan in this match and could win it 10 balls ago
 thirimane ne lambii chuppi ke baad haalanki jawaab diya
 He said, 'to be honest, Afghanistan bowled really well that day
 haalanki unhen wicket se madad mil rahi thi
 To be fair, today i had no problem playing
 'world cap main pehali baar hissaa le rahe suvidhahin or dashakon se yuddh kii traasadee jhel rahe afghanistan ke srilanka ke khilaaf pichley pradarshan ko dekha jaae, to kuch had tak yah sahi bhi he
 While Afghanistan came out to chase a small target, Sri Lanka had taken four wickets at the time of the sum of 51, while in the match on Sunday, England bowlers were able to get the only wicket and failed to control the run pace

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter 23 may ko aane vaale chunavi nattejey agar eczit pole kii raah hi gaye to iskaa asar kai jagahon par dikh saktaa he
 The first of these will affect the Federal Front, which was involved in making leaders of many regional parties
 chunavi nattejey agarexit pole kii raah par hi gaye to tathakthith fedral front kaa shiraja shuru hone se pehle hi bikhar saktaa he
 At present, it seems that there is not much space in the Lok Sabha for non-bjp parties, that is, as much as they were expecting
 kuch kshetreey netaaon ne bhaajapa ko sarkaar main aane se rokane ke liye kuch koshishen kii thim
 In fact, it was KCR who gave the idea of non-bjp, non-congress Federal Front in 2018 and met many regional leaders including Mamata at that time
 pichley hafte bhi raav ne diemke pramukh em
 K
 stallin se mulaakaat kii
 However, at the time of kcr's Chirpratidvandvi exit poll, he was more active and in the last one week he had met almost every leader in the opposition camp
 inamen upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi shaamil hai
 But one special thing that is worth noting is that what will be the effect of these results in the states where assembly elections are going to be held later this year
 ab is saal ke aakhir main jharkhand, maharashtra or haryana main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Assembly elections were also held in Jammu and Kashmir in the year 2014, but President's rule is in place and there will be elections only in favorable conditions
 phir bhi, agar jammu-kashmir main chunaav hue to loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko mili siton se vahaan sajaad gani lone ke saath uske rishte or adhik gadhe hi honge
 Emerging young leaders are influential in the Lone Valley and the BJP will try to form a new kind of government in Jammu region with maximum seats
 jharkhand main bhaajapa ko milane vaali siton se mukhyamantri raghubar das kii kismat bandhi he
 State BJP sources say, "if the BJP does not repeat the previous performance but performs well then it will remain the Chief Minister
 lekin bhaajapa ne agar jharkhand main bura pradarshan kiya to das kii jagah party kisi adivasee ko mukhyamantri ke chehre ke taur par project kar sakati he
 But there is more hope that the election of the state will be fought in the name of Modi
 "gauratlab he ki jharkhand main bhaajapa ko eczit pole main thik-thaak pradarshan karata hua dikhaaya gaya he
 The situation is the same in Haryana
 chunaav jeetne ke baad bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv ne haryana main gaiyr jat mukhyamantri kaa daanv chalaa tha
 However, if the results of the Lok Sabha are not favorable, this equation can also be reversed
 udhar maharashtra main, mukhyamantri devendra fadavis or shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare pratyaksh taur par loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan main matadaataaon ko yah samajhane ke liye ek manch par saath aae the ki saadhe chaar saal tak ek-duusare kii jamkar aalochana karne ke baad ve phir se kyon ikatthe hue hai
 However, the Shiv Sena tried its best to show solidarity on the issues of Ram temple and national security
 lekin yah bhi tay he ki bhaajapa or shivasena is baar vidhansabha main milakar ladenge
 If this alliance gets fewer seats in the results of the Lok Sabha, then it will be hand in hand
 par shivasena yaa bhaajapa donon main se kisi ek kaa pradarshan duusare se kam hua to uskaa asar vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt dikhegaa

 Lalu Prasad Yadav has received a setback from the Supreme Court in the fodder scam case
 court ne lalu ke khilaaf aapraadhik sajeesh kaa cese chalaane kii ijaajat de di he
 Sushil Modi, who has exposed the alleged scam of Lalu Yadav for the last few days, had a special conversation with NDTV
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar darasal mukademon main fanse 'kamjor' lalu kaa saath pasand karenge
 If Lalu is weak then it will be easy for Nitish to run the government
 lalu ke kamjor hone par sarkaar main hastkshep kam ho jayega
 Lalu's son will kneel down in front of Nitish
 nitish bijepi ke saath achche the argedy ke saath nahin? is sawaal ke jawaab par susheel modi ne kaha ki yah to janata or khud nitish kumaar donon hi jaanate hai
 He had a golden time with BJP
 gathbandhan tuutane ke baad bihar kii kya durdasha ho rahi he yah sab jaanate hai
 Lalu Yadav is stuck with several scams and the tapes of conversation with Shahabuddin
 nitish yah acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki lalu ab dabe rahenge
 It is beneficial for them
 agar nitish kumaar lalu yadav kaa saath chhod denge to kya bijepi samarthan degi? is sawaal ke jawaab main susheel modi ne kaha ki lalu kaa saath nitish kabhi nahin chodenge
 Lalu will be stuck in his lawsuits and Nitish needs a weak alliance
 unhen majboot partner nahin chahie
 They cannot find a weak partner from RJD
 aap argedy ko kamjor kah rahe hai, lekin aap bhi lalu ko hi nishaanaa banaate dikh rahe hai, nitish yaa jediu ko nahin
 
 
 In response to this question, Sushil Modi said that it is not so
 ham nitish ke sushasan or vikaas kii pole har roj kholte hai
 The comments kya lalu yadav par ghotaale ke aaropon se jude sabhi dastaavje sarkaar se hi aa rahe hai? is par susheel modi bole ki aisa nahin he ki saare dastavej vahiin se aa rahe hai, haa kuch dastavej sarkaar ke andar se aa rahe hai
 Was Nitish good with BJP and not with RJD? On the answer to this question, Sushil Modi said that both the public and Nitish Kumar themselves know this
 bijepi ke saath unke jivan kaa svarnim samay tha
 Everyone knows the plight of Bihar after the alliance broke
 lalu yadav kai ghotaalon or shahabuddin se baatcheet kaa tepe saamne aane ko lekar fanse hai
 Nitish is well aware that Lalu will now be buried
 yah unke liye phydemand he
 Will BJP support if Nitish Kumar leaves Lalu Yadav? In response to this question, Sushil Modi said that Nitish will never leave Lalu's company
 lalu apane mukademon main fanse rahenge or nitish ko kamjor alliance chahie
 They do not want a strong partner
 argedy se kamjor partner unhen nahin mil saktaa
 You are calling RJD weak, but you are also seen targeting Lalu and not Nitish or JDU
 
 
 is sawaal ke jawaab main susheel modi ne kaha ki aisa nahin he

 The OSD termed the newspaper's attitude irresponsible and threatened legal action

 ' haalanki mukhyamantri ke OSD yah maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai ki aisa bayaan siem ne diya he
 It is worth mentioning that the news was coming from an interview given to an English newspaper that Khattar had said, "muslims can live in the country but they have to give up eating beef, because cow is a matter of faith in the country
" gaay, gita or saraswati se desh kii bahusankhyak aabaadi kii aasthaaen judi hui hai or agar muslim gaay kaa maance khaanaa chhod denge, to unki dharmik aasthaaen aahat nahin ho jaaengi
 Khattar OSD Jawahar Yadav said that the Chief Minister definitely said that cow is a matter of faith in the country
 lekin baaki baaten managasaint hai
 It was also said that Khattar has said that the incident at Kidadari was wrong, which happened due to misunderstanding, it was the fault of both the parties
 khatter ne kaha peedit ne gaay par choti si tippanee kii, jisase ki logon kii dharmik bhavanaaen aahat ho gayi or ye ghatana baad main hinsa main badal gai, lekin baad main unhone ye bhi joda ki hamalaa karnaa or kisi ko maar dena bahut hi galat tha
 Khattar said that those who are guilty in Dadri case should be punished under the law

 Congress spokesperson Mim Afzal said that Khattar should be aware that only Muslims do not eat beef

Former captain Sourav Ganguly believes that the cricketers of Team India should be sent back home so that they can return to form by meeting the family
 thakee haari or out of form team india kahin se nahin lag rahi he ki wo dephending champion he
 Apart from this, Ganguly also lambasted the batsmen of Team India for their performance against England
 ganguli ne kaha, 'ab bahut ho chukaa he, team india ke cricketron ko turant apana bag pack karnaa chahie or ghar laut janaa chahie, jisase ki agle bade match se pehle wo thodaa behatar mahasoos kar saken
 Team India did not get a single win against Australia
 bharat ne pehle to test siries 0-2 se ganvaai or phir tri siries main australia or england ke khilaaf ek bhi match nahin jeet saki
 Ganguly was hurt by this defeat and said, 'team India needs rest at this time
 yah ek lanbaa daura rahaa he or ab samay aa gaya he ki unhen world cap se pehle apane parivaar se milanaa chahie
 If i had it in my hand, i would have sent some of them back home
 'ganguli ne star sports par kaha, 'main steven smith or viraat kohli kii tulana isliye nahin karnaa chahta hum kyonki smith har match ke baad apni garlfriend ke paas jaataa he or kohli ek hotel se duusare hotel
 Team India needs to meet their family members to make a comeback in the World Cup
 'iske alaava ganguli ne bhartiya ballebaajon khaskar rabindra jadeja ko jamkar latada
 He said that Jadeja should be asked to explain how he got out after playing such an irresponsible shot
 jis samay jadeja out hue team ke paas 7 over bache the or wo kuch der wicket par tikkar acchhee pari khel sakate the

 Such pictures are coming out of small cities that the head is bowed with shame
 achche-khaase padhe-likhe izzatdaar gharaanon kii ladkiyaan or auraten aajkal sharaab ke nashe main sadakon, par bazaar main or yahaan tak ki police thanon main bhi jhum rahi hai
 In Dehradun, a madam goes to the market with her five-year-old son, that too throughout Surur
 nasha sar par savaar tha lihaaja bazaar ko sar par uthaate der nahin lagi, phir kya tha
 In a few moments, there was fun
 phir police ai
 Madam was brought to the police station with great difficulty
 par asli dramato shaayad thane main hi hona tha
 Who is Madam? What do you do? Where did you come from? What else do you want? No one has answers to these questions here
 lekin madam ne apane hangaame se jaise puraa thana hi sir par uthaa liya tha
 Everyone was surprised to see these actions of Madam
 ab jab drama chaalu hi tha to koi maje le rahaa tha, koi samajhane kii koshish kar rahaa tha or inaki haalat par taras kha rahaa tha
 But Madam had become so much intoxicated that she was not worried about the world nor did she care about the world
 vakya dehradun ke patel nagar bazaar kaa he
 Yes, in the same Dehradun where three days ago, a college girl, having been drunk, had created so much uproar on the middle road that the policemen themselves had lost their whims
 lekin ye is shahar main nashebaaji kaa nayaa episod tha
 On Monday evening, suddenly the police got the news that a drunk woman had created a ruckus in the entire market
 khabar milte hi police fouran mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchi
 But upon reaching here, the police got a shock and a loud blow when Madam confronted the policemen directly
 isse pehle ki police use samajha-buja kar mauka e vaardaat se thane tak le jaati, madam ko na jane kya hua, achaanak hi unhone apane hosh gavaan die
 This was a difficult opportunity for the policemen to remove them from the spot as well as difficult
 kyonki madam apane kadamon par chalane se laachaar ho chuki thi khayr police ne kisi tarah unhen haath-pairon se taang kar thane tak pahunchaaya
 But the picture was still pending
 thane pahunchate-pahunchate in mohatarama ko hosh aa gaya or hosh main aate hi drama phir se chaalu ho gaya
 But the biggest trouble among all these dramas was his five-year-old child with Madam
 apni maa kaa ye rup dekh kar ye maasoom bhi jaise hairaan-pareshaan tha or uski is haalat ko dekhte hue pulisavaalon ne use zeus pilaa kar bahalane kii koshish kii
 But now the child could enjoy the juice that suddenly Mummy ji remembered her love
 mummy ko laadle kii yaad kya ai us bichaare kii to jaise shamat aa gai
 Unable to understand the gesture of getting up from the chair, the drunk mummy lifted her ladle and slammed it down and sat on the chair
 jab pulisavaalon ko ye baat nagavar guzari to unhone inhen samajhane kii koshish kii
 But now Madam felt as if she had made a mistake about the child
 iske baad pehle to ghutanon par baith madam ne bete ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 But ahead of it, the tide of emotions was such that Madame started crying bitterly
 thane ke tamaam kagajaat faad daale or der tak rone-dhone kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa
 Later, somehow, the police got her medical examination done and was waiting to become conscious
 kyonki iske alaava police ke paas koi chaara bhi nahin tha
 But when Madam regained consciousness in the morning, a new story was revealed
 dehradun kii is house wif ke paas 90 hajaar rupye the
 Those who disappeared somewhere in the wake of drunken betting

 aam chunaavon ke pehle charan ke matdaan ke kuch din pehle, pichley saal vasant main bihar bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar se amit shah ko jamini report saunpane ko kaha gaya
 Shah was then the election in-charge of Uttar Pradesh
 bihar ke us netaa ne kuch darshanik andaaj main kaha, “ham chahen to yah sochakar khush ho len or apni peeth thapthapaaen ki apane vot ko surakshit karne ke liye hamane koi kor kasar nahin chodi
 But the big truth is that people have already decided who to vote for and that name is Narendra Modi
 ”lekin raajnneeti main pandrah maah kaaphi lanbaa vakt hota he or ise shah se behatar bhala or koun jaanata he
 Or his arch-rival Nitish Kumar may realize this, for whom the next assembly election in the state is like a "do or die" opportunity as the world of electoral politics is full of uncertainties
 teraa maah pehle, shah apane kariyar kii aisi bulandi par pahunch gaye the jisaki misaal dhunde nahin milti
 Modi got a clear majority in the Lok Sabha
 bihar main bijepi 40 loksabhaa siton main se 31 siten jeet gai thi
 Nitish Kumar's party was swept and he resigned from the post of Chief Minister
 shah ab bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh hai
 He was in Patna on 11 June meeting with Bihar in-charge of the party Ananth Kumar and his team
 uske baad unhen purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi se milanaa tha, jo nitish ke uttaradhikari banaae gaye the lekin nau maah baad hi hataa die gaye
 There were many questions before Shah, what is the position of the party in Bihar today
 iske 11 din baad shah jab phir jayja lene laute to kaaphi kuch badla hua nahin tha
 Although he was refreshed a few days ago by leading the International Yoga Day celebrations in the city and looking in his natural style, he was missing his sense of old faith
 us din baithak main shaamil bijepi ke ek ranneetikaar kehete hai, “raajnneeti main saal bhar kaaphi lanbaa samay hota he
 The ground conditions have changed
 ”darasal dilli main bijepi kii karaari haar se hi bhagava party kaa rath ruk gaya tha or shah ke vijayi abhiyaan ke record par bhi viraam lag gaya
 Then, especially after joining hands of both ardent opponents Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar, the BJP is well aware that a little bit of laziness may be too much for him
 uske liye yah bhi acchhee khabar nahin ho sakati ki oonchi jati ke bhoomiharon main prabhaav rakhane vaale varisht netaa si
 P
 thakur or sahyogi dal rashtriya lok samta party ke mukhiya tathaa kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ke naam mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par uchhalein
 However, no one is taking these two claims seriously in the saffron camp
 party ke netaaon ko ehsaas he ki yah unki ore se dabaav banane kaa daanv he
 While Thakur wants to get his son a ticket, Kushwaha wants to get maximum seats for his party
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron ko ehsaas he ki aam chunaavon main congress, lalu yadav ke rashtriya janata dal (argedy) or nitish kumaar ke jedy(you) ko mili 45
 BJP got 36 to 06 percent votes
 48 pratishat vot se kaaphi adhik hai
 Then, the Modi wave is over
 aise main anaupchaarik baatcheet main bijepi ke kai netaa party kii sambhaavnaaon ko behatar nahin aank rahe hai
 But there is another truth with these vote percentage figures
 saadhaaran ganit to yahi kahata he ki agar loksabhaa kaa rujhaan hi vidhansabha chunaav main bhi doharaaya gaya to janata parivaar or congress gathjod ko aasaani se bahumat hasil ho jayega, lekin saamaanya tarkbuddhi yah bhi kahati he ki vot ekamusth itani aasaani se hastantarit nahin hote
 Hence it is less likely that the traditional voters of JD (U) will press the button in favor of RJD candidates in their constituency or the RJD voters will lean towards JD (U) candidates
 aise halaat main 4 yaa 5 pratishat matadaataaon main vipareet rujhaan yaa vot na daalane se alag tarah kaa nateeja aa saktaa he or bijepi kii sambhaavna bad sakati he
 For this reason, the strategy of the BJP leaders of Bihar is to play with the "internal contradictions" of these two parties which have come together for the sake of protecting their existence rather than any good intentions
 bijepi isiilie sabase pehle un 90 siton par focus kar rahi he jin par 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main argedy or jedy(you) ke ummidavaar ek-duusare ke khilaaf lade the
 At that time JD (U) used to be in NDA
 ab lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ke ekajute hone par in siton par jite yaa haare ummidavaaron main se kisi ek ko tikat dene se inkaar karnaa hoga
 bjp's plan is to instigate these candidates so that they can cut the votes of the common candidate of the Janata Parivar
 in siton par bijepi ko kaaphi sambhaavnaaen dikh rahi he
 a BJP strategist says, "nobody sacrifices in politics
 jo netaa paanch saal se chunaav kaa intjaar kar rahe hai, ve sirf lalu yadav yaa nitish kumaar ke chaahane bhar se chunavi maidan se hat nahin jaaenge
 They will become rebels and we hope that these 90 rebels will reap considerable votes
 ve jeet bhale na darj kar paaen, lekin bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko jitaane main madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai
 "the BJP can also put its hand on the backs of leaders like Pappu Yadav, who can field about 50 candidates in the electoral battle, to make inroads into lalu-nitish's vote bank
" i sake alaava bijepi apane kaaryakartaaon ko lalu-nitish gathjod kii “bemail sachaaiyon” kaa pardaafash karne ke liye bhi taiyaar kar rahi he
 JD (U) plans to send about 10,000 gps-equipped vehicles to 40,000 villages across the state to know the voters' mind, this is a duplicate of the bjp's 2014 election strategy
 duusari ore bijepi ne bhi nitish kumaar kii 2010 ke chunaavon kii ranneeti par amal karne kii yojana banaai he
 That is, it will focus on the strategy of exposing the alleged "jungle Raj" of Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi Raj
 shah ke waar room main patna pahunche dilli ke ek netaa kehete hai, “hamane 1990 ke dashak ke ve video khoj nikaale hai jab chaaron ore hatya, apharan or aparaadhon kaa bolbalaa tha
 These videos have been extracted from the treasury of several news channels, which present a frightening picture of Bihar of that time
 loksabhaa chunaavon kii hi tarah ham phir sabhi 243 vidhansabha kshetron main 250 prachaar gadibhan bhejenge, jo sandesh prasaarit karengi ki lalu yadav or sushasan (nitish kaa naaraa) ekadam ulat hai
 "in this case, 35-year-old Rituraj Sinha will prove to be of great use
 parade ke peeche rahakar prachaar kii vyavastha kaa kaary bhaar sanbhaalane vaale sinha doon skool or leeds uniwarsity bijness skool main pard chuke hai or bijepi ke waar room kii dekharekh karenge
 This publicity system includes sending video chariots to every region and getting its report
 isamen sone par suhaage kaa kaam nitish kumaar kaa 2010 kaa vah video karegaa jisamen unhone lalu yadav or unke “aatank raaj” par khulkar hamalaa kiya tha
 Sushil Kumar Modi, once the deputy chief minister in Nitish Kumar's government and bjp's strongman in the state, says, "sitting on Lalu Yadav's shoulder, Nitish Kumar cannot control crime in Bihar
 ”bihar kii jati aadhaarit chunavi raajnneeti main janata parivaar kaa samarthan aadhaar kaagaj par to ajey lagata he
 In contrast, the bjp's support base is limited to the Dalit votes brought by Ram Vilas Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party, apart from the upper castes, Banias and some backward castes
 jithan ram maanjhi ko apane paale main laakar bijepi unase chamatkaar kii ummid kar rahi he
 Among the 16 percent Dalit castes of Bihar, 5-6 percent of Mushars are said to have infiltrated Manjhi
 musahar jati bihar kii teesri sabase adhik aabaadi vaali jati he
 In such a situation, not only Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar, everyone has expectations from Bihar, so the stakes are quite high
 or yah siyaasi khel to abhi shuru hi hua he
 In the third session of the GST Conclave, economist and member of the NITI Aayog, Bibek Debroy, gave his opinion on the country's biggest economic reform program
 is satr kaa sanchaalan bijness today ke varisht patrkaar rajeev dube ne kiya
 Niti Aayog member Bivek Debroy said that India is the first federal country in the world which is implementing GST
 debaroy ke mutabik vastuon par doirect tex laganaa chahie,indrect taxnheen laganaa chahie
 Due to this, many things are out of GST
 yah ek nae kism kaa jiesti he lekin yadi ham vah jiesti lagu kar pate jiskaa hamane sapana dekha tha to arthvyavastha ko kahin zyada phayda pahunchataa
 After the implementation of GST, if the country benefits, then it needs to be prepared for some losses
 jiesti ke bare main 17 saal se charchaa ho rahi he, iske liye kai bardedlinetay kii gai par ye ab lagu ho rahaa he
 He said that this is the beginning of a good step
 agar ham adarsh GST kaa intjaar karte to shaayad or 17 saal lag jate
 Debroy said that in implementing GST, every party has agreed on one thing, GST Council has also done a lot of work on this
 council ko aage bhi lagaataar baithak kerani hogi, taaki yah sucharu rup se chal sake
 However, according to Debroy, GST will not be immediately beneficial
 iske liye hamen lanbaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 Biwake Debroy claimed that inflation in the early days has increased in the countries of the world in which GIST was implemented
 aisi ummid bharat main bhi he or kuch sector main mahangaai kaa asar hamen bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 However, the impact of inflation will not be seen in some sectors
 lekin itnaa tay he ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad kuch samay ke liye mahangaai badhane kaa khatra he
 The UPA government has got another scandal of scandal
 sieji (niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak) ke mutabik railway main 17 hajaar karod kaa ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he
 This scam has been done under the guise of transportation of iron ore in the railways
 sieji report main kaha gaya he ki railway kii dohari dhulaai niti kii aad lekar sarkari khazaane ko 17 hajaar karod se zyada kaa nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya he

 It is being told that this scam can be more than 17 thousand crores
 khabar ke mutabik railway ne jaruri dastavejon ke bina hi chhot de di
 According to the CAG, 443 parties were benefited in iron ore transportation

 The CAG has accused the Railways of colluding with 443 parties
 saath hi 17 hajaar 588 karod rupee kaa jurmaana vasuulne kii sifarish bhi kii he
 On the other hand, on the CAG report, BJP MP Kirti Azad has said tightly that 'this amount is too low for Congress

 The court said that it is very disappointing that middlemen and brokers have corrupted mps and to some extent they have been successful

 The court said that the Delhi Police had done nothing in the last two years and when the court ordered it, it came into action
 supreme court main dilli police ko final report daakhil karne ke liye teen hafte kaa samay diya gaya he
 During the Manmohan government's vote of confidence in 2008, BJP mps looted the bundles of notes in the House, complaining about the note being exchanged for votes, after which the Delhi Police registered a case on the complaint of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha

 The Congress's identity with Kamalapati Tripathi was associated with the Brahmins, and at the same time, after Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP could not find a strong Brahmin face in the state
 
 
 vaajapeyi or kalyaan singh ke rup main rajya main bijepi ke paas agade-pichde samaaj ke do taqatvar chehre the or inhen ke dam par party ne '90 ke dashak main shandaar pradarshan kiya, lekin kalyaan singh kii baghawat se bijepi ko rajya main jo nuksaan hua, vah uski bharpai abhi tak nahin kar pai he
 
 
 Now Kalyan Singh is once again in BJP
 
 
 rajya main hui narendra modi kii sabhi reliyon main unhen manch par khaas jagah milti he, lekin ab unamem vah karishma nahin bachaa he
 
 
 On the other hand, leaders like Murali Manohar Joshi, Kalraj Mishra and Kesharinath Tripathi, who were counted in the Brahmin leadership of the state along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, are now considered aged and their hold in state politics has gradually weakened
 
 
 yah baat alag he ki ab bijepi main brahman netritv kii nai paudh taiyaar ho gai he, lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi ke baad se paidaa hua shunya barkaraar he
 
 
 On the other hand, the bjp's attempts to take the Brahmins along have been rattled by the resentment of leaders like Murali Manohar Joshi, Kalraj Mishra and Kesharinath Tripathi
 
 
 ye teenon hi netaa kramshah banaras, kanpur or elahabaad se chunaav ladanaa chaah rahe hai, jabaki bijepi banaras se narendra modi, joshi ko kanpur se or calraj mishra ko shravasti se tikat dena chaah rahi he
 
 
 Kesharinath Tripathi has lost two assembly elections, and the party is not in a mood to give him a ticket
 
 
 bijepi kai siton se nae brahman chehron ko bhi utaarna chaah rahi he
 
 
 Through these faces close to Narendra Modi, the party wants to strengthen the new plant of Brahmin leadership in the state
 
 
 kaha ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main bijepi ko phir majboot karne ke liye is baar jitna anukool maahaul he, utana varsh 1998 ke baad se kabhi nahin rahaa he
 
 
 It is also being said in many opinion polls that the BJP can emerge as the single largest party
 
 
 kuch surveykshanon main to yah bhi kaha gaya he ki agadi jatiyaan bijepi ke paksh main golband ho rahi hai, lekin vaastaviktaa main aisa tabhi ho paaegaa, jab party ummidavaaron ke chayan main saavdhaanee rakhe
 
 
 It is said about up-bihar that no matter which party airs before the election, it is only right to guess the results when the names of candidates of all the parties are announced

 Opposition parties have been targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah by weaponizing the statements of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari for some time

 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has tagged Congress President Rahul Gandhi in his tweet, writing that for my courage i do not need your certificate
 lekin aashcharya is baat kaa he kii ek rashtriya party ke adhyaksh hone baad bhi hamaari sarkaar par hamalaa karne ke liye aapako media dwaara twist kii gai khabaron kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he
 It is the success of Modiji and our government that you have to find shoulder to attack
 @rahulgandhiji, meri himmat ke liye mujhe aap ke certificate kii jarurat nahi he lekin aashcharya is baat kaa he kii ek rashtriya party ke adhyaksh hone baad bhi hamaari sarkaar par hamalaa karne ke liye aapako media dwaara twist kiye gaye khabaron kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he

 Modi is making sincere efforts to get the farmers out of the worst situation that your policies have created, and we are succeeding in this

 Gadkari further wrote in the tweet that it is the difference between the DNA of us and the Congress that we believe in democracy and constitutional institutions
 aapke ye pantare chal nahin rahe
 Modiji will again become Prime Minister and we will move the country forward with strength
 lekin,aap bhavishya main samajhadaari or jimmedaari ke saath bartaav karenge yah ummid karata hum
 Let us tell you that even after bjp's defeat in three states of the Hindi belt, a controversy arose over the statement of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari
 pune main sahakaari bank karmiyon ke ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue gadakari ne kaha tha ki raajnneeti main haar kii samiksha ke liye cameti baithti he, lekin jab jeet milti he to koi poochne vaala nahin hota
 Because people are vying to take credit for success, but no one wants to accept failure, everyone starts pointing fingers at the other
 haalanki baad main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne apane bayaan par safai dete hue kaha tha ki unhone kehane kii koshish kii ki bank agar munaafe main aata he to bank kii leadership credit leti he
 In the same way, if the bank or business goes into a loss then the responsibility of the bank should also be taken
 aapako bataa den ki ganatantr diwas ke avasar par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kii pehali pankti main ek saath baatcheet karne kii tasviir soshal media par khub share kii gai thi
 Where were you when Javed Miandad hit a six off the final ball of Chetan Sharma's over in Sharjah in 1986 to give Pakistan a historic victory? i know where i was, sitting on my TV, and i was shocked at what happened
 uske baad se bhartiya cricket phans ke liye javed miyandad villen number van hi rahe, lekin kisi ne chetan sharma ke bare main sochaa?unhone hamaare liye lords main test match jeeta, ek divasiy shatak lagaaya
 Not only this, but also took a hat-trick in the World Cup, but despite this, only one delivery remained in his entire career
 mujhe yaad he kuch saal pehle jab maine unase is bare main sawaal poocha to vah ukhd se gaye or kaha 20 saal biit chuke hai kya ham ab kuch or baat nahin kar sakate hai?dukhad ye he ki bharat or pakistan main aamtaur par jo bhi mukaable hote hai, unamem itihaas kaa rang jarur ghulaa miltaa he
 Perhaps that's why we keep reminding our Pakistani friends again and again that they never beat India in the World Cup
 aajkal pakistani cricket fain hona aasaan nahin he
 The best team of Emraan, Javed and Wasim are today showing up with lax and directionless abilities
 saalon kii aantarik uthaa-patake kaa asar pakistan ke cricket par dikhaai dene laga he
 This is why for the first time in years, we started our arch-rivals as a strong contender for victory
 ham sirf ek din ke liye unase behatar team nahin the, ham unase kaaphi samay se behatar team hai
 i also wonder about the celebrations being overblown
 twitor par hamaara hashtag # realfinal he

 Shortly thereafter, Modi hoisted the pm's speech from Lalan College in Bhuj
 pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main upie kii uplabdhiyaan ginai or kaha ki abhi kuch hi faasla tay kiya he par manzil bahut dur he
 At the same time, Modi's Independence Day address was completely political
 jisamen bhrashtachar, garibi or mahangaai jaise muddon ko lekar piem or congress party par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa gaya
 While the Prime Minister's speech was 35 minutes, Modi's speech lasted for about 55 minutes
 piem ke bhaashan main ek jimmedaar pad par baithe shaks kii jhalak thi to modi ke bhaashan main bhavi piem kii lalak thi
 Pakistan and other neighbors Mulkmanmohan Singh: In a strong message to the neighboring country, PM Manmohan Singh said that anti-india activities from the neighboring country would have to be stopped to improve relations, and also stressed that the recent killing of soldiers on the Line of Control All steps will be taken to stop the dastardly act
 piem ne apane bhaashan main chini ghuspaith kaa koi zikr nahin kiya
 Narendra Modi: PM may have strongly condemned Pakistan but the Chief Minister of Gujarat called it inadequate
 unhone kaha, 'antarrashtriya sambandhon ko dekhte hue pradhanmantri ke str kii bhashaa kya honi chahie, main samajhataa hum
 But for the army to be strong, the country expects a little stronger language from the PM
 desh kii sena kaa manobal badhaane ke liye laal kila sarvottam sthaan he

 This is the largest such effort worldwide
 narendra modithjis khaadya suraksha bill kaa dam piem bhar rahe hai, isamen nayaa kya he? pehle se kai rajyon main garibon ko 3 rupee prati kilo chaaval mil rahaa he
 The truth is that this bill will work to snatch food from the plate of the poor

 Also face to face on the Uttarakhand tragedy, Manmohan Singh: The PM assured the people of Uttarakhand from the ramparts of the Red Fort that the whole country is with them in this time of difficulty

 But reiterated his old point that the only religion of a politician is the country and the constitution of the country is a religious book for him
 film kaa naam: tubalitediarector: kabir khanster cast: salmaan khan, sohail khan, juju, matin re tangu, om puri, shahrukh khan, mohammad jishaan ayumvadhi: 2 ghanta 16 minutesrtificate: uretimga: 2
 5 Stardirectors Kabir Khan and Salman Khan have come together to film Tiger and Bajrangi Bhai
 ab is jodi ne teesri film banaai he naam he 'tubalite'
 This time, Kabir Khan has tried to show the story of this film on screen, inspired by the Hollywood film 'little Boy'
 vaise hollywood kii film 'little boy' ko bahut zyada saraahaa nahin gaya tha par uske hindi rupantaran main kuch na kuch khaas milane kii ummid he
 Will Kabir Khan's film get as much love as his previous films with Salman Khan? Come to know the answer to this question, know how the film is made
 5550 screens par relies hogi 'tubalite', box offis ke 'bahubali' bane salmankahaneeyah kahani lakshmana (salmaan khan) kii he jise paas pados ke bachche tubalite ke naam se bulaate hai
 Laxman's brother is Bharata (sohail Khan)
 bharat or lakshmana ek tarah se ek duusare ke liye sab kuch he kyonki bachapan main hi in mata pita kaa dehanth ho gaya tha
 Both brothers grow up with each other
 kahani main imotional pal tab aata he jab bharat kii naukari army main lag jaati he or indo-china yuddh ke liye use janaa padataa he or jiske waapas aane kii koi ummid nahin hoti
 Laxman becomes completely emotional and tries his best to bring back his brother at any cost, for which Laxman's journey begins
 kahani main banne khan (om puri) or chote bachche guo (matin) or uski maa(ju ju) kii entry se kai saare twist or terns aate hai
 But Laxman is sure that his brother Bharat will definitely return
 ab kya uskaa yakeen vaastaviktaa main badal paata he, yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 After Radio and Nach Meri Jaan, you can see Tubelight's emotional song Tinka Tinka Releases: Salman Khan has been seen playing on the backfoot for the first time from a macho man's avatar and you may have seen this avatar before or you can say that Fresh appears in Avatar for the first time
 - film kii kahani to pehle hi trailor main bataai ja chuki he lekin uske filmakan kaa tarika kabir ne alag tarah se pesh karne kii koshish kii he jisamen zyaadaatar aapako imotional maahaul hi miltaa he
 Before the interval of the film and after the interval, the story keeps going in different directions where on one side Salman's thinking is like an innocent little child before the interval, due to which he is called Tubelight, the other part of the story
 i change that thinking
 - film main salmaan khan ne bahut hi badhiya kaam kiya he, vahi swargeey abhinayta ompuri kaa kaam bhi kaabile tarif he
 Child artist Matin Ray Tangu has done a great job, which makes you laugh from time to time
 sohail khan or chinis abhinetri juju ne bhi sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Shahrukh Khan has a small but quite important role
 tubalite ke nae gane naach meri jaan main dikhaa salmaan-sohail kaa BHAIHOOD- film kaa sangeet relies se pehle saraahaa ja rahaa tha or khaas taur se radio or tinkaa-tinkaa vaala gaanaa bahut femes hua
 - Direction cinematography locations of the film are amazing
 vaise to film saath ke dashak main besd he lekin dekhte-dekhte kai muddon par ankhen kholane kaa kaam bhi karti he jo ki aajkal bhi sabhi ke saamne najar aate hi aate hai
 Weak Links - The weak link of the film is its story which is inspired by the Hollywood film Little Boy and it will be a less surprising film for those who have seen that film
 - salmaan khan kaa naam jahan main aate hi aap ke saamne dabang khan, sultan or tabadatod ection karne vaale insaan kaa cheharaa najar aata he, lekin aapako yah sari chijen is film main nahin dikhaai dengi
 - The screenplay of the film also looks quite scattered, which if presented well, the story would have been of another level
 film kii soch acchhee he lekin use puri tareeke se darsha paane main mekar asaksham dikhte hai
 - The film is very emotional but many times there are many scenes in which there is emotion but the emotional feel is not felt as an audience, which was very important to work on
 - film kaa clymex kaaphi predictable sa he jise or dilachasp kiya jaataa to dekhne kaa alag majaa hota
 The box-office combo pack of Salman Khan and Eid has become very famous due to which the film has always got a good opening
 jahaan ek taraf salmaan khan kii film dabang or bodyguard ne 100 karod ke club main entry kii vahi ek tha tiger, kik or sultan jaisi filmon ne 200 karod kaa bhi aankada paar kiya lage haath bajrangi bhaijan ne 300 karod ke aankade ko bhi peeche chhod diya
 According to trade pundits, the earnings on the first day of Tubelight are being told to be 25 to 30 crores

 punjab main ek baar phir se oparation blue star or bhindrawaale kaa jinn bottle se baahar nikal aayaa he
 This time, politics in the name of Operation Blue Star and Bhindranwale is happening when the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, the highest organization of Sikhs, is putting pictures of all those people in a museum being built in Harminder Sahib, Amritsar in memory of Operation Blue Star
 Were killed during this operation
 lekin, sabase zyada vivaad oparation blue star ke dauraan maare gaye jaranel singh bhindrawaale kii tasviir ko lekar ho rahaa he
 In fact, the SGPC has decided that Bhindranwale's picture will be put in the museum being built in memory of the Blue Star operation and this is going to the Congress Government of Punjab exasperated
 captain amarinder singh ne kaha ki esajipisi kaa is tarah se oparation blue star main maare gaye aatanki bhindrawaale kii tasviir ko harmandir sahib ke parisar main banane vaale museum main jagah dena jaij nahin he
 Describing SGPC as a puppet in the hands of the Akali Dal, Captain Amarinder Singh said that whenever the Akali Dal is out of power, it keeps on doing such acts to spoil the atmosphere of Punjab in collaboration with the Radical Groups
 isse punjab kii aman shanti bhang hogi: captain amarinder singh, mukhyamantri, punjabjab akali dal satta main tha tab unhone pichley 10 saal main aisa kuch bhi karne kii koshish nahin kii or naa hi esajipisi kii taraf se aisa kuch kiya gaya
 But now, as soon as these people are out of power, they are getting all these things done by SGPC at their behest
 main prakaash singh badal se poochna chaahunga ki aakhirkaar aisa sab karne kii jarurat kya he
 Doing all this will disturb the peace of Punjab
 iske alaava or kuch hasil nahin hone vaala
 The Akali Dal rotated in this matter and said that SGPC is the supreme institution of Sikhs and no one is interfering in its functioning
 bhindrawaale kii tasviir vahaan par kyun lagaai ja rahi he iskaa jawaab bhi esajipisi kii taraf se hi diya ja saktaa he
 Akali Dal spokesman Jungveer Singh said that Congress is responsible for bringing terrorism in the name of Blue Star Operation in Punjab
 ab yahi congress akali dal par radical grupon ke saath mili hone kaa aarope laga rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party also does not see anything wrong in the museum being built in memory of the people killed during the Blue Star operation in Harmandir Sahib and the pictures of those killed in the operation
 aam aadmi party ke punjab ke senior leader sukhpal khehara ne kaha ki agar blue star oparation kii yaad main maare gaye logon ke liye koi yaadgaar museum harmandir sahib main manaaya ja rahaa he to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 However, he gave a befitting reply to the question asked to put Bhindranwale's picture in this museum
 unhone kaha, "blue star oparation ke dauraan sikhon ke saath jyaadati kii gai thi or agar is oparation kii yaad main koi museum banaaya ja rahaa he to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Although whose picture is to be put here, only the SGPC can tell
 "vahiin blue star oparation ourbhinderawaaleko lekar jari raajnneeti ke bich punjab main america or canada se kaam kar rahi sikhon kii ek sanstha sikh for justise ne alag khalistaan banane ke liye ek refrendom karwaane ke liye "refrendom 2020" ke bade-bade poster punjab ke kai ilaakon main lagava die hai

 aarope he ki sikh for justise punjab main "refrendom 2020" ke naam parpunjab kaa maahaul bigaadane kii koshishkar rahaa he
 The Punjab Police made it clear that those seeking to create a separate Khalistan in this way and those trying to spoil the atmosphere of Punjab will be dealt with vigorously

 film 'piku' na sirf box offis par safal hui, balki iskaa kirdaar piku bhi khub charchaa main rahaa
 The way Deepika played this role, her hard work was clearly visible on the screen
 bangla lahaze ko seekhney ke liye deepika ne khaas mehnat kii or teacher se training bhi lee thi
 This is the reason that the filmmakers of Bengal liked Deepika's acting very much and they want to take Deepika in their films
 yah alag baat he ki deepika ne ab tak koi bengali film sweekaar nahin kii he
 The comments lekin kya pataa deepika bhavishya main koi bangla film karne ko taiyaar ho jaaen? bengal main experimental cinema par zyaada jor diya jaataa he or deepika ko bhi aisi filmein or aise chunauti bhare kirdaar pasand aate hai
 Its example is the film 'finding Funny' which was an experimental film in itself and Deepika's role as a Govan girl
 iske liye deepika ne goan bhashaa bhi sikhi thi
 Deepika's film 'piku' was also different from regular films in itself
 film 'chennai express' main deepika ne dakshin bhartiya bhashaa ke lahaze main hindi boli thi
 Not only this, she was seen speaking Hindi in Marathi accent in 'happy New Year'
 in donon filmon main deepika ke lahaze ko darshakon ne khub pasand kiya
 Deepika worked very hard to learn Bangla accent and also took training from teacher
 yahi vajah he ki bengal ke filmkaaron ko deepika kii acting khub pasand ai or ve apni filmon main deepika ko lenaa chaahate hai
 It is a different matter that Deepika has not accepted any Bengali film till now
 tippaniyan But do you know that Deepika will be ready to do a Bengali film in future? There is a lot of emphasis on experimental cinema in Bengal and Deepika also likes films and such challenging characters
 isaki misaal he film 'finding funni' jo apane aap main ek praayogic film thi or deepika kii bhoomika goan ladki kii thi
 For this, Deepika had also learned Govan language
 deepika kii film 'piku' bhi apane aap main regular filmon se alag thi
 In the film 'chennai Express', Deepika spoke Hindi in a South Indian language accent
 yahi nahin 'happy new year' main vah marathi lahaze main hindi bolti najar ain
 Deepika's accent in both these films was well received by the audience
 lekin kya pataa deepika bhavishya main koi bangla film karne ko taiyaar ho jaaen? bengal main experimental cinema par zyaada jor diya jaataa he or deepika ko bhi aisi filmein or aise chunauti bhare kirdaar pasand aate hai

 Scattered in opposition in Bihar, two days bandh has been called against Bihar and NRC on the same issue
 pehla band 19 disambar ko vam dalon ne bulaayaa he to doosraa 21 disambar ko argedy ne
 Now the rest of the two parties of the Grand Alliance will support this two-day bandh
 saaf he ek hi mudde par band ko lekar bihar main vipaksh main ekajutata nahin hone ke kaaran bihar kii janata ko do-do din band jhelana padegaa
 Janata Dal u says that there is a battle of supremacy to become the leader in the opposition, because the rest of the grand alliance is not ready to accept Tejashwi Yadav as the leader and due to this, the people of Bihar will have to face a two-day shutdown
 saaf he ki naagarikta sanshodhan act or enarasi ko lekar bulaae gaye is band par vipaksh banta hua he
 RLSP President Upendra Kushwaha said that he wanted a one-day bandh but due to lack of agreement between the Left parties and the RJD, it was split in two days and we will both support the day's shutdown
 upendra kushvaha ne bataaya karanupendra kushvaha ne kaha ki mudda ek he or sab log iskaa virodh chaahate hai lekin 2 dinon kaa kaarykram alag-alag ghoshit ho gaya he
 After the announcement, we also spoke to the Communist Party and the RJD
 congress, maanjhi ji mukesh sahani ji sab logon se baat hui or sab logon ne is baat par sahmati jataai ki ek hi din ke antaraal main bihar ko 2 din band naa kiya jaae to acha hoga
 We personally tried the initiative ourselves
 sab logon ne milakar bhi koshish kii lekin us koshish main kamyaabi nahin mili
