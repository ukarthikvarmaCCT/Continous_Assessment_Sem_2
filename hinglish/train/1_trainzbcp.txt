 In September 1945, British officials based in India sent intelligence teams to identify Bose and arrest him if possible
 iske bajaay ve durghatana kii kahani ke saath laute
 The documents stated that on the morning of August 18, 1945, a Japanese Air Force bomber flew from Turan, Vietnam with Bose and 12-13 other passengers and crew members
 vimaan main japani sena ke leftinent general tii
 Shidei was also aboard
 vimaan kaa maarg heto-taipe-derren-tokyo tha
 The three-member Netaji Investigation Committee was set up by the Government of India in 1956 and its chairman was Major General Shah Nawaz Khan of the Azad Hind Fauj of Netaji
 samiti ko bataaya gaya ki chunki mausam thik tha or ingine sucharu rup se kaam kar rahe the, isliye payalat ne heto ke upar se or sidhe taipe jane kaa faisla kiya, jahaan subah yaa dopaher tak pahunchaa jaataa
 Japanese air staff officer and passenger Major Taro Kono told the committee, i found that the engines on the left were not working properly
 isliye main vimaan ke andar gaya or andar main ingine kii jaanch karne ke baad maine paaya ki yah thik se kaam rahaa
 He said that the engineer present with him also checked the engine
 hawaii adde par rakrakhaav prabharee enjinier captain naakaamura urf yamamoto ne major cono ke saath sahmati jataai ki baayin ore ke ingine main gadabadi he
 Yamamamoto said that the pilot told him that it was a new engine
 unhone kaha ki ingine kii gati dhimi karne ke baad payalat ne kareeb paanch minute ke liye ise edjust kiya
 The engine was tested twice by Major Takizawa (pilot)
 edjust karne ke baad maine khud ko santusht kiya ki ingine kii sthiti thik he
 Major Takizawa also agreed with me that there was nothing wrong with the engine
 haalanki, bose ke edisi or ek sah yatri karnal habib ur rahamaan ke mutabik kuch hi der baad ek jabardast visphot hua
 Nakamura, looking from the ground, said, "just after takeoff, the plane bent to its left and i saw something falling from the plane, later i found that it was a propeller
" ’’ unhone yah bhi bataaya ki vimaan 30 se 40 meter kii oonchai tak pahunchaa tha
 He estimated that a plane crash occurred about 100 meters from the concrete runway and immediately caught fire on its front
 karnal rahamaan ne bataaya, netaji meri ore mude
 i said, leave from the front, there is no way back
 unhone bataaya, ham pravesh dwaar se nahin nikal sake, kyonki yah package or anya chizon se band tha
 So Netaji came out ahead, in fact he ran through fire
 main aag kii unheen lapaton main unke peeche-peeche tha
 He told, when i got out, i saw him standing 10 yards ahead of me, standing, looking at me from the opposite direction

 There was not much fire in his trousers and it was not necessary to remove them
 rahamaan uni kapade pahane hue the, jabaki bose sooti khaaki pahane hue the, jiske chalate usamen aasaani se aag lag gai
 Rehman told, i lay them on the ground and found that there was a deep cut on their head, maybe it was on the left side
 unka cheharaa jhulas gaya tha or unke bal bhi aag se jhulas gaye the
 He told, Netaji told me in Hindustani - You did not like much? i replied that i think i am safe
 apane bare main unhone kaha ki unhen lagata he ki vah nahin batch paaenge
 The comments bose ne kaha, jab apane mulk waapas jaaen, to mulk ke bhaaiyon ko bataanaa ki main aakhri dam tak mulk kii aazaadee ke liye ladata rahoonga, ve jang-e-aazaadee ko jari rakhen
 Hindustan will definitely be free, no slave can keep it
 vimaan main maujuud leftinent shiro nonogaki ne kaha, vimaan durghatana ke baad jab maine pehle netaji ko dekha to vah vimaan ke baayen pankh ke kinare ke paas kahin khadey the
 His clothes were on fire and his assistant (colonel Rahman) was trying to take off his coat
 haalanki rahamaan, nonogaki, cono, takahashi or naakaamura dwaara muhaiyaa kiye gaye byore main visangati he
 He gave evidence 11 years after the accident
 website ne bataaya ki lekin unke bayanon se durghatana hone or iske parinamswaroop bose ke gambhir taur par jhulasane ke tathy ke bare main koi do raay nahin he
 Netaji was taken to Nanmon Military Hospital in critical condition nearby
 sitambar, 1945 main bharat sthit british adhikariyon ne bose kaa ata-pataa lagane tathaa sambhav ho to unhen giraftaar karne ke liye khufia timen bheji
 Instead he returned with a story of the accident

 Engineer Capt
 Nakamura alias Yamamoto, in charge of maintenance at the airport, agreed with Major Kono that there was a problem with the engine on the left
 yamamamoto ne kaha ki payalat ne unase kaha ki yah ek nayaa ingine he
 He said that after slowing the engine speed, the pilot adjusted it for about five minutes
 ingine ko major takijava (payalat) ne do baar jaancha
 After adjusting i satisfied myself that the engine condition was fine
 major takijava ne is baat se bhi mere saath sahmati jataai ki ingine main kuch gadabadi nahin he
 However, according to Bose's ADC and a co-passenger, Colonel Habib ur Rehman, a massive explosion occurred shortly after
 jameen par se dekh rahe naakaamura ne kaha, udaan bharne ke thik baad vimaan apni bain ore jhuk gaya or maine vimaan se kuch girte dekha, baad main maine paaya ki vah propeller tha
 He also said that the aircraft had reached a height of 30 to 40 meters
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki kancreet kii hawaipattee se kareeb 100 meter kii duuri par vimaan durghatana hua or turant hi iske agle hisse main aag lag gai
 Colonel Rahman said, Netaji turned towards me

 mahanagaron main aajkal kaaphi raftaar pakad chuki liv-in relationships ke bare main visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki ye rishte zyada dinon tak kaayam nahin rahete
 It is worth noting that till a few decades ago the invalid live-in relationship in the society has become a reality and fashion today

 Expert consultant regarding live-in relationship Dr

 Sharma says, "most couples who live far away from home choose to live together in big cities simply because of attraction
" pyaar or samarthan kii talash main ve saanskrithik fark, paariwarik prishthbhumi or vittiya avrodh jaisi chizon kii andekhi karte hai
 "she says" but the things these couples initially ignore later emerge again and again which leads to a rift in their relationship

 dharmendra kumaar kaa kahana he ‘‘aam taur par liv-in main rah rahe jode main ek-duusare ke prati koi naitik javabdehi nahin hoti

 ’’ vah kehete hai ‘‘shaadishuda jode kii tarah liv-in main rah rahe jode apane saathi ke prati patibaddh or jimmedaar nahin hote
 They keep themselves free from all these things and also look for someone else
 ’’ baharhaal, visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki ye rishte aamtaur par purushon kii vajah se naakaam hote hai kyonki ve maanate hai ki unki mashooqa yaa bivi ko unka aadesh maananaa chahie

 In Pakistan cricket, once again there is a tussle between two senior players
 purv test captain younus khan ne apni tulana maujuuda test captain misbah-ul-haq se karne par naaraazgi jataai he
 Younis said that he is senior to Misbah and also has more experience in international cricket
 iske awala test main 30 shatak banane vaale pehle pakistani ballebaaz younus ne kaha ki wo umr main bhi misbah se chaar saal chote hai or unke khilne kaa style bhi pakistani captain se alag he
 In this case, his comparison with Misbah is incorrect
 pakistan ke liye 101 test khilne vaale younus ne ye bhi kaha ki wo dobaaraa se test team kii captaini lene ko taiyaar hai
 Younus said, "if i get a chance to captain the Test team again before retiring, i will gladly accept it
" ' Yunus captained Pakistan's ODI, Test and T20 teams in 2009
 is dauraan team kaa pradarshan bhi behatar rahaa
 Meanwhile, the team won the ICC T20 World Cup under the captaincy of Younis

 Another bowler of the team, Shoaib Akhtar has written about this in his autobiography
 vahiin shahid afaridi kii kai khilaadiyon se anban hoti rahi he
 However Afridi says this is more love among the players of the team, so they fight
 younus ne kaha ki wo misbah se senior hai or antarrashtriya cricket kaa bhi zyaada anubhav he
 Younus, the first Pakistani batsman to score 30 centuries in his Avala Test, said that he is four years younger than Misbah in his age and his playing style is also different from the Pakistani captain
 aise main unki misbah se tulana galat he
 Younis, who played 101 Tests for Pakistan, also said that he is ready to take the captaincy of the Test team again
 younus ne kaha, 'sanyas lene se pehle agar mujhe dobaaraa test team kii captaini karne kaa mauqaa mili to main kushi se sweekaar karugaan

 a political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet
 Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people
 We believe this decision should not be compromised by money

 After Sachin Tendulkar announced his retirement from Test cricket after playing his 200th Test next month, the current and former cricketers on Thursday brought praise to the legendary batsman
 cricket kii duniya main har taraf tendulkar kii saraahna hi dekhne ko mili
 Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said, "there has been such a big vacuum in Indian batting
" uski jagah lenaa aasaan nahin hoga

 ' unhone kaha, ‘bhartiya cricket main chauthe number par kuch mahaan khilaadi khele hai
 Whoever bats at number four is under a lot of pressure and has to meet great expectations
 ’ Tendulkar, considered the greatest batsman of modern cricket, today announced that he would quit Test cricket after playing the 200th Test next month against the West Indies, ending his 24-year international career
 gavaskar ne kaha ki unhone jab tendulkar ko pehali baar net par ballebaaji karte hue dekha tha tabhi unhen samaj main aa gaya tha ki vah mahaan uplabdhiyaan hasil karegaa
 Gavaskar said, "it is hard to imagine a player who has done such a mixture of traditional technique and aggression like Little Master in the history of the game
" aisa koi shaat nahin he jise vah nahin khel saktaa
 ' ek anya purv bhartiya captain or lambey samay tak tendulkar ke team ke saathi rahe saurav ganguli ne kaa ki westeindies shrunkhlaa kii shuruyaat se pehle sanyas kii ghoshnaa karke is diggaj ballebaaj ne sahi faisla kiya
 Ganguly said, 'this is the right decision and he took it at the right time
 main behad khush hum ki usne shrunkhlaa kii shuruyaat se pehle aisa kiya
 i urge the people of the country to come to see these two Tests, whether it is in Kolkata or Mumbai, just to show respect to this great man
 ’ Former Indian captain and Lok Sabha member Mohammad Azharuddin said Tendulkar's decision was not surprising
 unhone kaha, ‘nishchit taur par aisa hone vaala tha lekin mujhe aisi koi jaankaree nahin thi ki kab aisa hone vaala he
 But this is his decision and we should respect it

 According to him, 'how much more salary do government employees need? With the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, is the salary of government employees reduced, is it less? What will a man do after earning so much money? ”when the CM became a philosopher
 
 The process of Nitish's teachings did not stop here
 unka kahana tha ki bharat main har ek kii zaruratein puri karne liye kaaphi sansaadhan hai lekin kisi ek ke bhi laalach ko nahin
 From this, the Chief Minister became philosophical and said - 'everyone has to leave the world one day and everything will be left here

 Maharashtra Youth Congress president Satyajit Tambe has said that this is the propaganda of BJP before the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi aadhikarik taur par soshal media par film ko pramot kar rahi he
 He further said that it is clear that BJP is doing this to divert attention from the defeat in three states and the issue of farmers
 bataa den ki film kaa trailor is samay soshal media kii galiyon main dhooma machaa rahaa he
 The film stars Anupam Kher as Manmohan Singh, the former Prime Minister of the country

 unhone likhaa ki congress aisi film ko kyon sensor karana chaahati he jo ek kitaab par aadhaarit he
 And the book has also been published in 2014
 kya sirf isliye kyonki kitaab kaaphi kam log padhate hai or film adhik log dekhte hai
 Why does Congress want to censor a film when the book it is based on was published way back in April 2014? Just because fewer people read books than watch a movie? Where are the champions of free speech and expression? Stand up for artistic freedom! # theaccidentalprimeministerpic

 World and European champions Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the unilateral finals of the Euro 2012 Football Championship
 isi ke saath spain itihaas rachate hue lagaataar teen bade khitaab jeetne vaali duniya kii pehali team ban gaya
 Vincent del Bosque's team also became the first team to defend the European title, as well as the first team to win three consecutive major titles
 spain ne isse pehle 2008 main euro cap or 2010 main vishwa cap jeeta tha
 Facing things like losing offensive ability in league and knockout stage matches, the Spanish team has proved with their aggressive play in the finals here that the golden era of Spain football will continue
 spain kii jeet main andres iniesta or jaavi kii bhoomika ahm rahi jinhone david silva (14wein minute), jordi alba (41wein minute) or fernando torace (84wein minute) ke gol main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Juan Marta (88th minute) scored the team's fourth goal
 euro 2008 main germany ke khilaaf nirnaayak gol daagne vaale torace bhi is dauraan do europea championships ke final main gol daagne vaale pehle khilaadi bane
 This is the largest margin of victory during title wins in Euro tournament history
 isse pehle pashchim germany ne 1972 main soviet sangh ko 3- 0 se haraaya tha
 Spain also achieved the feat of being the only team to win the Euro title three times apart from Germany (1972, 1980 and 1992)
 spain ne isse pehle 1964 or 2008 main khitaab jeeta tha
 On the other hand, the knock-out team, which showed the way out to teams like Germany and England in the knockout, did not look in the rhythm at all
 germany ke khilaaf semifinal jeet ke hero mario baloteli ko apane prayaso kaa koi laabh nahin mila jabaki andria pilre ko spain ke midfield ne ulajhaa kar rakhaa
 Italy also had to play with just 10 players in the final 30 minutes due to using all their substitute players, making Spain's path even easier and scoring two more goals in the meantime
 thiyago motaa italy ke tisare or antim sthanapann khilaadi ke rup main utarane ke kuch der baad hi 61wein minute main chotil ho gaye the jisase team ko baaki samay 10 khilaadiyon ke saath khelnaa padaa
 At the international level, Spain's dominance in the recent past can be gauged from the fact that it has suffered only two defeats in the last 51 competitive matches
 entwarp olympic 1920 ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab spain ne pratispardhi footbal main 90 minute ke bheetar italy ko haraaya he
 However, the match was disappointing for Italy coach Sezar Prandelli
 italy ne unke maargdarshan main isse pehle 15 maichon main se ek bhi nahin ganvaaya tha or team ne is dauraan 10 maichon main ek bhi gol nahin khaaya lekin spain ke aakraamak khel ke saamne unke khilaadiyon kii ek nahin chali
 Spain made a stormy start to the match
 portugal ke khilaaf semifinal se baahar sesk febregas kii spain ke shuruyaat line ap main vaapasi hui or vah apni ‘falls nine’ kii bhoomika main hi khele jo unhone italy ke khilaaf 10 june ko group si match main 1-1 ke drow ke dauraan nibhaai thi
 Italian coach Prandelli also made a transition to his starting line up, replacing Federico Balzareti as Ignazio Abate
 jaavi ko 10wein minute main gol karne kaa shandaar mauka mila lekin unka damdaar shaat golkeeper jiyanluigi buphone ke upar se nikal gaya
 However, Spain took the lead after four minutes
 iniesta ne daayin chor se sesk febregas ko shandaar paas diya jinhone teji dikhaate hue silva ko cross diya or unhen ise hader se gol ke andar pahunchane main koi dikkat nahin hui
 Italy suffered the brunt of a slow start
 team ko shuruyaat main hi badlaav karne ko majaboor hona padaa jab jeeorgio chileni chotil ho gaye or coach ne unki jagah left back main balajareti ko utaara
 Italy also got a chance after that but Antonio Casano failed to impress Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas and the goalkeeper had no problem stopping his slow shot
 italy ke striker casaano ko dobaaraa mauka mila lekin is baar riyal madrid ke golkeeper kasilas ne baks ke baahar se maare unke dandanaate hue shaat ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Spain accelerated their attacks just before the intermission, which also benefited them when Jordi Alba, who had a great performance throughout the tournament, showed the ball in the 41st minute on Javi's brilliant pass
 prendeli ne hof time ke samay casaano kii jagah antonio di natale ko utaara
 De Natale made his presence known on the ground
 ebet ke cross par unka hader gol ke fapper se nikal gaya jabaki kuch minute baad vah dobaaraa spain ke dephence ko bhedane main safal rahe lekin is baar kasilas ne unke prayaas ko naakaam kar diya
 Bufon on the other hand thwarted Fabregas' attempt
 is dauraan italy kii team bhaagyashaalee rahi jab sarjeeo ramos kaa hader leonardo benuchi ke haath main lagane ke baavjood referi ise nahin dekh paae or unhone penlti kik nahin di
 Expecting a return to Italy ended when Mota had to be taken out on a stretcher due to a hamstring strain, about half an hour before the match was over and Prandelli's team had to play the rest of the match with 10 players
 vah isse paanch minute pehle hi ricardo motolivo kii jagah maidan par utre the
 After the match there was a slight lack of thrill but Torres changed the atmosphere to take the field
 unhone jaavi ke paas par 84wein minute main team kii ore se teesraa gol daaga jabaki iske baad chelsi ke apane saathi khilaadi mata ko 88wein minute main chauthaa gol karne main madad kii

 vahiin, duusari taraf 2014 main centre main modi sarkaar aane ke baad se vyavasthaaon kaa bhi digitalikaran hua he
 But in the name of online security, the country still has the same law, which was made 18 years ago
 saperon kaa desh kahe jane vaale bharat main aaj kareeb 250 million log fasebuk kaa istemaal karte hai
 According to a 2016 report, more than 36 crore people in the country have started using the Internet

 sarkaar ke farmaan or cash kii kami ne logon ko cashles banane ko majaboor kar diya
 But recently, when the leak of personal information of people was revealed through Facebook, there was an uproar in the whole country
 ek videshi company cambridge analitica par fasebuk se data lekar bharat main chunaavon ko prabhavit karne ke aarope lage
 After this, allegations were made between the two main parties of the country, the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress for exporting public data
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi aarope laga rahe hai ki narendra modi ap ke jariye janata kaa data america bheja gaya to bijepi ne palatwaar karte hue kaha he ki congress apane ap se logon kii nijee jaankaree singapore bhej rahi he

 sarkaar ne cambridge analitica se 31 march tak jawaab maanga he ki kya vah bharatiyon ke data kaa durupyog kar unke matdaan karne ke tareeke ko prabhavit karne main shaamil thi
 In the notice, the company has also been asked about which units have availed its services, how it keeps the data and whether it takes the consent of the users

 From time to time, experts have emphasized that this law is inadequate in terms of the current situation and even more vulnerable to data theft

 In this episode, he has once again targeted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)

 Kumar Vishwas tweeted that when the Congress 'almost refused' the self-styled dwarf who stood with the tongue out at the door 50 times, today 'lalayit' took the tongue out of his 'inanimate-naib' done ! Such gruesome collapse of revolution is rare in world politics! Just a few more days, 100 crimes are about to be completed

 The twitter of Kumar Vishwas is being linked to the same statement of Manish Sisodia
 abhi bhi vaqt he modi shah kii jodi ko 18 siton ( haryana, dilli or chandigarh) par haraane kaa, agar congress chaahe to
 Explain that Manish Sisodia, who is considered number two in the Aam Aadmi Party, said that the pair of Modi and Shah is dangerous for the country

 Akhilesh Yadav will attend Tejapratap Yadav's wedding on May 12, preparations for the marriage of Tej Pratap Yadav, elder son of RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav, and Aishwarya Rai, daughter of former minister Chandrika Rai, are going on in Patna
 lalu parivaar ne desh ke sabhi bade netaaon ko shaadi main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya he
 But so far only Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav have sent their consent to attend the wedding
 jang aakhri daur main he
 Everyone knows the consequences
 bagdadi or uske samrajya kaa khaatmaa kabhi bhi ho saktaa he
 So the remaining people have already started to choose the heir of Baghdadi or, say, the successor of Baghdadi
 yani iesas ko ab bagdadi kii jagah nae khalipha kii talash he
 The reason for this search is the battle of Mosul, where Baghdadi terrorists are becoming less and less with each passing day
 iraqi shahar mosul ke alag-alag ilaaqon main iesas buree tarah ghirta ja rahaa he
 One by one, all his forts are being destroyed
 iesas kaa patan ho rahaa he
 ISIS has been battered
 iesas ke khatme kii ghadi ab qareeb aa chuki he
 At any time, the name of this most dreaded terrorist organization can be erased from the world map
 iraq kii takreeban sabhi choti-badi jagahon se pehle hi uske paanv ukhd chuke hai
 Now Mosul is the only place left here, where there is a face-to-face battle between the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and the Iraqi army 
 acchhee khabar ye he ki yahaan bhi uski haalat patali ho chali he, lekin isse pehle ki ham aapako mosul main jari is ladaai kii ek mukammal tasviir dikhaaen
 Tells the story of a SAS sniper
 vaise to is jang main namaaloom kitne hi sniper lagaataar chun-chun kar lagaataar apane dushmano ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai, lekin inhen sharp shootaron main kuch aise bhi hai, jinhone iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraane kii centuri puri kar lee he
 In recent days in Mosul, ISIS also occupied the base that was once used by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein
 is base ko chaaron ore se gherne ke baad esees ke ek sniper main bas ek goli se isamen chupe iesas ke commander ko dher kar diya
 This shooter's target was so accurate that the bullet hit the commander's head right in the middle
 vaise to ye sniper apane nishaanon kaa record bhi menten karte hai, lekin iraq pahunchane ke baad usne itane aatankwaadiyon ko maare ki uski gitni bhi gadabada chuki thi
 The Iraqi military's sporadic war with ISIS was already on
 lekin aupchaarik taur par 16 oktober ko jang e mosul kaa elaan hua
 The motive was to drive ISIS out of the Iraqi city of Mosul
 oparation do hafte main hi 120 se zyaada gaanv or kasbe iesai se khaali ho gaye
 The Iraqi army entered Mosul on 1 November
 saikadon aatankiyon kii maut ke baad ab kisi bhi vaqt yahaan iraqi fuj ko jeet mil sakati he
 In such a situation, now just understand that between the defeat of ISIS and the victory of the Iraqi army there is only one step
 pichley teen saalon se bagdadi ne iraq or syria ko khun ke aansu rulaae
 Thousands of people were killed
 lakhon parivaar ko besahaara banaaya
 Gave weeds from house to house
 ab vahi din khud bagdadi or uske apane aatanki ke liye laut aae hai
 Now he is crying tears of blood himself
 kismat par pachhataa rahe hai
 For the last few days, there is a strong news that Baghdadi has been killed in the war
 uske aatanki ab sachmuch yateem ho gaye hai
 The era of panic continues in the world of panic
 aatank kii aulaaden pasopesh main hai
 Do not let the news go out that we have become a gimmick
 kamare main dehshat kaa alam he
 The Terror Khalifa hangs as a picture in the frame
 aakhir maajaraa kya he
 It has been reported from inside that the spirit of the ISIS Khalifa has taken care of Jahannam
 jangal main aag kii tarah iraq or syria main ye khabar aam he ki bagdadi ke iesas ko ab ek or bagdadi kii talash he
 Before the terrorists consider themselves as orphans, they are ready to be crowned the new patron of terror
 ek behad sanjeeda jeruselum post ke hawaale se ye khabar he ki bagdadi mosul main maaraa ja chukaa he
 ISISK senior terrorists are holding an emergency meeting at an undisclosed location in Iraq for his successor

 His performance in the film was praised
 ab ve karan johar kii film takht main najar aaengi
 Released this week 'kya Delhi Kya Lahore', starring Vijay Raaz, Manu Rishi, Vishwajit Pradhan and Raj Zutshi
 
 
 film kii kahani ghatati he hindustan kii azaadi or desh ke bantwaare ke baad, jahaan hindustan-pakistan kii sarhad par ladate-ladate dono ore ke sipaahiyon main se sirf ek-ek sipaahi rah jaataa he or phir bhukh or pyaas unhen bandook kii bhashaa chhodkar insaaniyat kii bhashaa bolne par majaboor kar detii he
 
 
 Karan Arora has produced 'kya Dilli Kya Lahore', Vijay Raaz is himself the director, and the film is presented by veteran writer-lyricist Gulzar
 
 
 yah film donon deshon kii raajnneetik sargarmi or us rishte kii baat karti he, jise mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 
 
 The entire film is shot in almost the same area
 
 
 lagbhag puri film main do hi kirdaar nazar aate hai, lekin iske baavjood film kahin bhi apni raftaar nahin khoti, or na hi film main kirdaaron kii kami mahasoos hoti he
 
 
 The biggest thing is that without giving any knowledge, the film laughs and says its thing very easily
 
 
 agar aapako sanjeeda or arthpurna cinema dekhne kaa shauk he to is film kii kasi hui script or screenple aapako hilne kaa mauka nahin denge
 
 
 Many dialogues of 'kya Delhi Kya Lahore' will tickle you and leave a deep impact on you
 
 
 film kii khubsuurati he isaki saadagi, vijay raaj kaa behtareen abhinay or nirdesan
 
 
 The work of Manu Rishi is also good, but the way he has captured the dialogue somewhere, it misses something
 
 
 raaj jutshi or vishwajit pradhan ke kirdaar chote hai, lekin donon ne acha kaam kiya he
 
 
 The film's music and background score contribute well to the story
 
 
 thodi-si takneekee baarikiyon par dhyaan dene kii or zarurat thi
 
 
 For example, some scenes lack background music and a little editing spice, but may not be missed by the audience
 
 
 kul milakar 'kya dilli kya lahore' aapkaa manoranjan karte hue dil tak pahunch jaaegi
 
 
 My rating for this film is - 4 stars

 He said that he played 14 characters in the film Had Kar Di Aap
 govinda ne bataaya ki 14 unka lucky number tha
 The actor said, "the first date when i was shooting was 14th
 14 saalon tak main top par rahaa or jab loksabhaa main aayaa to vah 14veen loksabhaa thi
 All the elders were saying that Govind you do this Lok Sabha, this is the 14th Lok Sabha
 " unhone kaha ki unhen bujurg jo kuch bhi kah dete hai vah kar jate hai phir vah parvaah nahin kiya karte
 When Govinda was asked if he repented that he went into politics? Because the actors who used to work with them at that time are still working in the cinema world
 iske jawaab main govinda ne kaha ki raajnneeti mushkil kaam he
 Govinda said that politics is not easy work, but is man known only for easy tasks in the world? At that time, elderly people and senior people said that this is the 14th Lok Sabha and you do Govind

 haryana ke chunaav nateezon ne jharkhand main bhaajapa ko 'alert mod' main laa diya he
 In the last assembly elections, the BJP, which somehow managed to form a government by breaking six mlas of the main opposition Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JHVMO), wants to touch the majority figure this time
 bhaajapa ne rashtriya upaadhyaksh or rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav prabharee om maathur ko is morche par beete agast se hi laga rakhaa he
 In the Lok Sabha elections held in Jharkhand this year, even though the NDA won 12 of the 14 seats, the party is not in any way cheating the assembly elections
 party kaa maananaa he ki haryana kii sabhi 10 loksabhaa siton par sweep karne ke baad bhi jab vidhansabha chunaav main bahumat nahin mil paaya to phir jharkhand ko lekar bhi 'ati aatmavishvaas' kaa shikaar hona thik nahin
 a leader associated with election management in the BJP said, "the BJP is fortunate in the matter that it gives red alert in time for any election result in the future, which helps to overcome further strategic lapses
 haryana ke chunaav nattejey dekhakar party 'phulpruf plan' par kaam kar rahi he
 To put it on the ground, a team of such well-known leaders of the organization will be launched, who will understand the mood of Jharkhand
 ' darasal, jharkhand ko lekar bhaajapa kii chintaa isliye he, kyonki pichhali baar 81 main se sirf 37 siten milin thim
 The BJP then had to disband the six mlas of the main opposition party Jhavimo for a majority
 iske baad bahumat ke liye jaruri 41 ke mukaable bhaajapa ke paas 43 vidhayak hue the
 The governor had approved the merger of more than two-thirds of the mlas as they joined the BJP
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki agar 2014 kii tarah phir bhaajapa kii gaadi bahumat se dur khadi ho gai to pichhali baar kii tarah jodtod kii raajnneeti ke liye majaboor hona padegaa, aise main party is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main puri takat jhonkkar bahumat laane kii koshish main he
 Sources reveal that for the first time in Jharkhand, non-tribal Chief Minister Raghubar Das has been asked to keep dissident leaders united at any cost

 Kushwaha said that my party will contest elections in Madhya Pradesh
 unhone apane istife kii baat ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki abhi seat ke bantwaare kii baat final nahin hui he
 On the number of seats, he said that we have demanded three seats and this is also valid because earlier we had contested three seats
 unhone kaha ki hamane aaj bijepi netaa bhupendra yadav se bhi mulaakaat kii or kaha ki jo bhi sanstha hoti he usamen laabh-haani kii hissedari sabaki honi chahie
 Why not just share in profit, not share in loss? With the arrival of JDU, the number of seats has reduced but everyone will divide together
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar kii hissedari tab nahin thi jab hamaari hissedari kendriya mantrimandal main thi
 But, today it is a matter of stake, so why are we being denied it? This is my question
 bataa den ki seat bantwaare ko lekar araspi adhyaksh upendra kushvaha dilli aae hai or aaj unki bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat honi thi
 But before that, Kushwaha met Bhupendra Yadav, Bihar in-charge of the BJP

 About half an hour met between Upendra Kushwaha and Bhupendra Yadav

 is dauraan shivaraj ne kaha ki empi kii janata ke liye dil se congress ko sahyog duungaa lekin kaam nahin kiya to virodh bhi karuunga
 Let us tell you that Shivraj Singh Chauhan has recently vacated CM House after going to power
 74 bangala sthit apane bangale main baithe shivaraj ne loksabhaa chunaav ladane se lekar madhya pradesh main uria kii kami tak par khulkar baat kii
 Excerpts from conversation with Shivraj
 
 
 sawaal: aapane siem house 13 saal baad khaali kiya
 Now living in a much smaller house than that
 niraashaa mahasoos nahin hoti?shivaraj: nahin, jameen aasmaan koi antar nahin he, ghar bhale hi chota ho dil to bahut bada he or yah dil to dhadkta bhi he to madhya pradesh kii 7:30 karod janata ke liye dhadkta he
 This house is also the home of the public and if the public is here, then they will serve the public by staying here
 bada chota to soch se hota he, vichaar se hota he, ghar se nahin hota
 i will serve the public in the public house
 sawaal: ghar main to kam hi rukate hai aap? janata ke bich pahunch gaye phir se
 Shivraj: People are my life, i live for him and without him i cannot live
 mukhyamantri tha to kalam kii takat se unki seva karata tha
 Today, if i am in the role of a watchman, then i will talk where i see trouble and trouble and if i am not resolved by talking, then boys and boys will resolve
 lekin main apni janata ke saath hi rahoonga or janata ke liye hi jiunga
 Question: The watchman is saying the words again and again, are you not becoming the leader of the opposition? For the public, with the public and with me
 sawaal: congress kaa mantrimandal tay nahin ho paa rahaa he is par kya kahenge?shivaraj: dukhi karne vaali baat yah he ki pehle jo kaam karnaa chahie tha mantrimandal ke vistaar kaa, vyavasthit sarkaar banane kaa, vah kaam karne ke baad phir gatividhiyaan baaki kii shuru hoti hai
 Surprisingly, the cabinet has not been formed yet
 lekin uske pehle hi bhartiya janata party ke log jo kuch baithe hai unhen chun-chun kar hataao
 i do not mind that most of us had resigned and the other thing that is causing me trouble is, today i have talked to Kamal Nath
 raajnneetik vidwesh kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki congress ke netaa chun-chun kar badale le rahe hai
 Police are making cases, selling stones
 jhagade karvaa rahe hai
 Defeat continues to prevail in a democracy
 jeet kaa matlab yah nahin ki aap vipakshi dal ke kaaryakartaaon ko pratadit karo, unhen jail bhijwaao, un par cese banawaao
 If this government has this priority, then i have nothing to say
 bal kii praathamikta yah honi chahie ki mantrimandal bane kaam vyavasthit dhang se chalaao
 Question: Is there a urea crisis in the state? What is the reason for this? Shivraj: i was also the Chief Minister, i used to sit in Delhi for four days
 pehle se ham taiyaari karte the, kitne uria kii aavashyaktaa he, lekin aaj kisi kaa dhyaan is taraf he hi nahin
 Today i read the news wherein the Central Government was accused
 are khud kaa miss management he, khud kaa dhyaan nahin he, khud kisaan kii chintaa nahin kar rahe ho or dosha dusron ko de rahe ho
 It is being said that Punjab shipped urea, shipped to Rajasthan
 vahaan kiski sarkaar he
 There is a Congress government in Punjab
 rajasthan main congress kii sarkaar he
 Efforts are being made to throw unbridled mud
 kisaanon kii chintaa kisi ko nahin he
 Due to miss management, the farmer is distraught, upset and only blame the central government
 dosha unke maththe madh do, congress ke dwaara aisi baaten kii ja rahi hai, yah thik nahin he
 They should constitute the cabinet immediately
 kaam vyavasthit chalaaen
 Run the government properly and solve the problems of the people
 sawaal: 7 taarikh ko vidhansabha kaa satr he kya bijepi aakraamak rahegi?shivaraj: pehali baat to yah he ki main madhya pradesh kii janata se imoshanalee judaa or bijepi madhya pradesh kii janata kaa kalyaan or madhya pradesh kaa vikaas chaahati he isliye hamaara kaam yah nahin he ki gaaliyaan hi den
 Just protest at every step, i am repeating again, i have also told the Chief Minister of the state, Kamal Nath that the development of the state should not be interrupted
 sarkaar bhale hi duusari aa gai lekin vikaas main nirantarata ho, iske liye ham har tarah kaa sahyog karenge
 Will cooperate positively
 lekin janata ke kaam nahin hue, vachan puure nahin hue to phir ham prachand virodh bhi karenge
 But the government will also cooperate to ensure that the development of the state is not interrupted
 sawaal: kamalnath ne bhi jataa diya he ki wo saath lekar chalenge
 We are also celebrating Good Governance Day
 shivaraj: uske liye main badhai detaa hum, kamalnath ji ko
 Those who do a good job, i would heartily congratulate them
 keval virodh karne ke liye virodh nahin karuunga, unhone ek acchhee parampara ko sthapit kiya he
 Good Governance Day in the name of Atal ji because Atal ji was the symbol of good governance
 hamane prarambh kiya unhone jari rakhaa unako dhanyavad
 Question: Celebrated so many festivals in CM House, did programs
 kya janata shivaraj ko phir kabhi us rup main dekhegi?shivaraj: sarvadharm sambhaav kaa pratik or siem house maine janata kaa house bana diya tha
 There is also a small house where i will live
 vahaan kaarykram chote honge
 We will celebrate all the festivals here, there will be Janmashtami, there will be Ramnavami, there will be Shivratri, there will be Holi, there will be Rosa Iftar, there will be Prakashotsav, there will be forgiveness and also Christmas
 kyonki yah bharat kii maati or bharat kii jadon main he
 All religions harmony and i represent the culture of India
 sawaal: 13 saal siem rahe ab aap kehete hai 'tiger zindaa he' kyon?shivaraj: main jahaan jaataa tha niraashaa hoti thi, janata roti thi, log yahaan milane aate hai, to bhi afsos jataate hai
 They come with tears in their eyes, then worry about what we should do, who to go to, many times there are such incidents that false prosecutions are being made, tortured, then there is injustice in me
 There is a sense of fight against, because injustice is greater than injustice
 main sahan nahin karuunga, apni kaaryakartaaon ke liye or apni janata ke liye main datakar ladaai laduunga or or isliye mere munh se niklaa ki chintaa mat karo tiger abhi zindaa he
 Question: Tiger's roar will be heard in the Assembly? agar hoga to ham ladenge, acchhee cheez hogi ham dhanyavad denge or gadabad hogi to ham ladenge
 Question: Sushma Swaraj has refused to contest from Vidisha Lok Sabha seat
 Will Shivraj contest the elections, go to the center? Shivraj: Sushma Didi is a leader whom the whole country respects
 ishwar kii un par krupa he, vah swasth hai, hamaare bich hai, maine unako bahut aagrah kiya lekin antim faisla party karegi
 Even Sushma ji cannot decide about them here, because this party will decide
 swasthya ke kaarnon se unka gaanv-gaanv janaa ab sambhav nahin he
 He has a big heart because he had no problem in winning
 abhi bhi vah chunaav laden to jeet jaaengi, lekin unhone kaha ki yah nyaay nahin hoga
 Nevertheless, we would urge that they contest
 meraa to sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota kyonki mujhase agar koi puche to meraa sharir, man, buddhi or aatma madhya pradesh main kaam karne ke liye he
 Is for the people of Madhya Pradesh

 According to sources, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was also called to this meeting but he did not attend
 ek taraf jahaan dilli main ceiling kaa danda chal rahaa he to vahiin ise lekar meeting kaa daur bhi jari he
 According to the guidelines of the Supreme Court, to find a way out of this, there was a lot of chaos in which Delhi BJP President, Lieutenant Governor, DDA chief was also involved
 is maukey par dilli bijepi ne congress or aam aadmi party ko jamkar kosa
 BJP president Manoj Tiwari said that similar sealing was done on the orders of the 2007 Supreme Court, but people were clashed with the police during the sealing
 iske baad supreme court ke aadesh par hi ise roak gaya tha, lekin ceiling rukvane ke liye prachaar kar diya ki inhone ceiling rukvaai thi
 Whereas, this was not the case and what is happening in Delhi is due to the Congress, there, it is not easy to accuse others of targeting Aam Aadmi Party instead of solving the problem
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki supreme court ke guidelins ko maanate hue sarkaar 15 se 20 dinon main bill lekar master plan main sanshodhan karegi

 bjp's best effort is to get out of the way as soon as possible to provide relief to the businessmen so that the traditional vote bank of the BJP can be retained

 saath hi saath unhone sweekaar kiya he ki maujuuda varsh main vah apni sevaayen english team ko nahin de paaenge

 aaie jaanate hai 7 wo baaten jo ladke apni hone vaali partner main khojate hai
 
 
 1
 kairactor- sundar hona acchhee baat he lekin aapaki pahchaan aapke karmon se hi banati he
 Boys look for a good character in girls, who not only has to decorate but comes to walk with this world step by step
 2
 Intelligence- Because everyone loves intelligence a lot
 ladako ko bhi wo ladkiyaan bahut bhaati hai jo budhimaan hoti hai
 Who have the ability to make decisions
 kyonki har chote-mote nirnay ke liye partner par nirbhar rahanaa ladakon ke liye bojhil ho jaataa he
 3
 sammaan- rishte main sammaan bahut jaruri hota he
 Girls who respect boys and stand together in every decision are very fond of boys
 ladke ke parivaar or doston kaa sammaan karne vaali ladakiyon par ladke jaan chhidakte hai
 4
 aakarshan- har ladkaa chahta he ki uski partner duniya kii sabase khubasurat ladki bane
 This is not possible, but it happens many times that someone starts to look so cute that you reject the standards of beauty, and a feeling of heartbreak in love comes out of the throat that this is the most beautiful girl in the world
 isliye ladakiyon main aakarshan ko ladke khaas tavajjo dete hai
 These 6 things rich in calcium make bones strong
 aatmavishvaas- kehete hai aatmavishvaas se duniya jiti ja sakati he
 Confidence brings a positive energy that fills everyone with energy
 ladako ko bhi aatmavishvaas se bhari ladkiyaan bahut pasand aati hai
 6
 mahatvakanksha- kaha jaataa he ki mahatvakankshaon kaa koi ant nahin hota santosh main jeena chahie lekin santosh main jeena bahut boring ho jaataa he
 If there is mind, then there is also ambition
 mahatvakankshi ladkiyaan ladakon ko behad pasand aati hai
 Because of this, more women are suffering from cancer in the country
 saadagi- mirza gaalib kaa ek sher tha ki, 'is saadagi pe koun na mar jaae i khuda, ladate hai or haath main talwaar bhi nahin
 'boys love a lot on simplistic girls
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko unke rajnatik jivan kaa sabase bada sahaara aaj se 11 saal pehle laalkrishna adwani ne diya tha
 In 2002, PM Vajpayee was in a tough mood after the Gujarat riots, but on Advani's persuasion, he just kept quiet talking about practicing religion and only a few months ago Modi, who replaced Keshubhai Patel as Chief Minister, survived
 magar tab se ab tak teen vidhansabha chunaav biit chuke hai, jisamen jeet ne modi kaa kad party se bhi bada kar diya
 At the same time, under the leadership of Advani, the BJP has lost the last Lok Sabha election badly
 iske baavjood adwani abhi bhi party main apana kendriya role dekh rahe hai or iske liye unka loksabhaa main bane rahanaa behad jaruri he
 And now Advani does not want to resort to Modi in any way
 sutron kii maane to adwani ne yah tay kar liya he ki vah aglaa loksabhaa chunaav gujarat kii gandhinagar seat se nahin ladenge
 Instead, he can contest from Bhopal or Indore seat of Madhya Pradesh
 gujarat bijepi ke netaa bhi is baat ko dabi jubaan main kaboolte hai
 The reason for Advani leaving Gandhinagar seat is also the party's local cadre and Modi
 jab narendra modi party main bahut junior level par the, tab se, yani 1991 se laalkrishna adwani is seat se chunaav lard rahe hai
 In the 91 Lok Sabha elections, Advani also contested from New Delhi seat and won
 unhone dilli main rajesh khanna ko shikast di thi
 But then Advani chose the Gandhinagar seat and resigned from the New Delhi seat
 uske baad se vah lagaataar gandhi nagar seat se hi chunaav jitate aa rahe hai
 Whether or not there is a NDA wave in the country, he did not have trouble reaching Parliament
 magar pichley chunaav main aisa nahin hua
 In 2004, he won the elections with 2 lakh 17 thousand votes, but after five years the margin of victory has reduced to 1 lakh
 vah bhi tab mumkin hua, jab desh ke duusare ilaakon main prastaavit dauron main katautee kar adwani ko gandhinagar seat par kaaphi vakt khapaana padaa
 Not only this, the people of his family kept camping here till the elections were over
 party sutron kii maane to adwani ko tabhi samaj aa gaya tha ki yah seat unka surakshit kila nahin rahi
 And a decision of the Modi government was also responsible for it being unsafe
 modi ne loksabhaa chunaavon se kuch maheene pehle hi rajya kii rajdhani main ek atikaraman virdohi abhiyaan ko free hand diya tha
 Due to this, hundreds of such temples in Gandhi Nagar were removed from the road which were illegally occupied or which were obstructing the road widening
 isse sthaneey janata main bijepi ko lekar kaaphi naaraazgi thi
 Local party workers also did not appear to be very enthusiastic about Advani's campaign
 haalia halaat kii baat karen, to modi kii piem kii mahatvakanksha par jab tab adwani ankush lagaate rahe hai
 For this, instead of talking about their claim themselves, the elderly BJP leaders are taking cover of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 modi ke vikaas purush ke daawey ke barakes isiilie baar-baar party manch se adwani shivaraj kaa naam lenaa nahin bhoolatey
 Shivraj also presides over the big programs of the government
 aise main madhya pradesh se behatar thikaana adwani ke liye or kya hoga

 com / 1s0umiggux— ANI (@ani_news)february 21, 2017 Just before the announcement of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Samajwadi Party has released its list of 325 candidates
 sapa kii is suchi ke jariye party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne apane putr mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko to jhatka diya hi he, rajya kii chauthi sabase badi raajnneetik party congress ko bhi hairaan kar diya he
 This is because the alliance between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party was believed to be fixed and the matter was stuck on the seat sharing
 mulaayam ne 325 ummidavaaron kii suchi jari kar sandesh de diya he ki jo bhi baatcheet hogi wo baaki bachi hui 78 siton ke aasapaas hi hogi
 The question is, will the Congress accept this streak drawn by Mulayam? Congress was the first to get active about the elections
 When it came to the UP elections, the Congress was the first party to start its preparations vigorously
 ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ko upi main jeet dilaane kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 Sheila Dixit, who ruled Delhi for 15 years, was declared a CM candidate with full vocals
 isse pehle sanghathan main pherbadal kar reeta bahuguna joshi kii chuttee kii gai or rajbabbar jaise charchit chehre ko pradesh main congress kaa bhavishya sudhaarney kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 Rajaram Pal, Rajesh Mishra, Bhagwati Prasad and Imran Masood were tried as vice-presidents to help the OBC, Brahmin, Dalit and Muslim voters respectively
 rahul gandhi kisaan yatra ke jariye jile-jile ghume
 27 years - UP Behala was given the slogan and new experiments like khat sabhas were done
 ek baargi aisa laga ki congress upi ke chunaavon main puraa damakham dikhaane ke liye taiyaar he lekin in sabake bich november ke pehle hafte main prashanth kishor or sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav kii mulaakaat kii khabar ai to sabko hairaan kar gai
 Since then, there has been speculation of Congress and SP alliance and amid these speculations, Mulayam has released the list of 325 candidates
 prashanth kishor or mulaayam kii mulaakaat se shuru hue kayasprashanth kishor kii mulaayam singhke saath baithak ke baad jab congress or sapa ke gathbandhan kii atakalein lageen to sabase pehla khandan congress kii ore se aayaa
 All the Congress leaders kept on arguing that Prashant Kishor's meeting with any leader does not mean that the Congress will form an alliance with that party, but other than this cleanliness, the incident went on that kept the coalition's speculations alive
 dilli main ek kaarykram main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne ye kahkar sabko hairaan kar diya ki sapa apane dam par sarkaar banaaegi lekin agar congress ke saath uskaa gathbandhan hota he to ve milakar 300 se zyada siten jeet lenge
 After this, the news came on the last day that the Congress, Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal and Samajwadi Party have almost finalized and SP will leave about 100 seats for these two parties
 lekin in khabaron ke agle hi din khud akhilesh yadav ne sabhi 403 siton par apane pasandida ummidavaaron kii list mulaayam ko saunp di or mulaayam ne ab 325 pratkashiyon ke tikat bhi final kar die hai
 akhilesh-rahul, who are seen doing each other, are told that Mulayam is ready for an alliance with the Congress but he has no intention of taking the initiative himself
 saath hi mulaayam gathbandhan apni sharton par chaahate hai kyonki ve jaanate hai ki aisa koi bhi gathbandhan samaajawaadee party se zyada congress kii majaburi he
 On the other hand, the Congress also knows that it has been continuously defeated in the elections for some time
 agar is samay kii baat karen to congress ke paas ekmaatr bada rajya karnataka hi hai
 Uttarakhand also has elections with UP, while Himachal will have elections later this year
 aise main wo bihar kii tarah bijepi ke khilaaf kisi gathbandhan main shaamil hona chaahati he taaki kisi tarah satta main uski bhagidaari sunishchit ho sake
 Rahul Gandhi is also targeting Modi government and BJP instead of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in his rallies of UP
 ye 2012 ke unke chunaav prachaar ke bilkul ulat he jab ve apni har sabha main sattarudh bispi par hamalaa bolte hue 'hathi note khaataa he' vaali baat doharaate the
 At that time, Akhilesh Yadav was also seen making fun of Rahul
 rahul ke bhari sabha main bahucharchit list faadane vaali ghatana ke baad unhone chutki lee thi ki rahul josh main kahin manch se na kud jaaen
 This time, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi call each other a good boy
 congress kii majaburi he, gathbandhan jaruri hairaajnneetik jaankaron ke mutabik congress akhilesh kii saaf chhavi or vikaas ke unke agenda par daanv khelnaa chaahati he
 She wants to stand herself as an ally of Akhilesh Yadav instead of Samajwadi Party so that her image can be taken advantage of
 upi main congress ne pichley do vidhansabha chunaavon main kramshah 22 or 28 siten hasil kin
 Apart from Sonia and Rahul, no party candidate could win in the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main is baar wo mauka nahin khona chaahati
 There is no major anti-incumbency factor in the state against the Akhilesh Yadav government
 aise main agar party sapa ke saath gathbandhan karti bhi he to wo uske liye siddhanton ke saath samjhaute jaise sthiti nahin kahi jaaegi
 On the other hand, the way Akhilesh is struggling with internal insurgency in the SP, the Congress's support from outside gives him some strength
 aise main koi aashcharya nahin hona chahie ki mulaayam kii is list main sanshodhan hon or vidhansabha chunaav main sapa or congress ek hi manch par najar aaen

 bijepi main mahabharat machaa hua he or iskaa taaja adhyay rajasthan se judaa hua he
 In what Vasundhara Raje had threatened to resign, imposing a visit to a rival leader, 51 BJP mlas have resigned in support of Vasundhara
 ab bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari pareshaan hai or unhone arun jetali ko vasundhara raaje ko manaane kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 There are many maharathis in the BJP who are looking forward to the throne of Delhi after two years
 chaal or charitra par jor dene vaali bhartiya janata party ke andar jis tarah se mahabharat machaa hua he
 The latest chapter in the bjp's Mahabharata is the challenge of Vasundhara Raje
 jaipur main party kii kor cameti main vasundhara ke aane par is kadar narebaaji hui, jaise rajasthan main unhen sabase bade kad kaa netaa sabit karne kaa koi muqabla yojit ho rahaa ho
 In fact, Gulabchand Kataria, a prominent leader of Rajasthan BJP, wanted to take out Lok Jagaran Yatra in Mewar and Vasunghara Raje did not want Kataria to take out
 meeting main isi mudde par charchaa honi thi
 Kataria is among the closest leaders of the Sangh, so he is also special to Gadkari
 bijepi main gadakari virdohi kheme kii kareebi maani jane vaali vasundhara raaje kataaria ke par katarne kaa koi mauka chhodana nahin chaahatin
 Vasundhara Raje's close aide and BJP national general secretary Kiran Maheshwari was already opposing Kataria's visit
 aise main gadakari ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki jaipur kii baithak main hi yatra par faisla hoga
 When the meeting started, most of the core committee members stood in favor of Kataria's visit, leaving Vasundhara Raje angry and announced her resignation
 78 main se 51 bijepi vidhayakon ne istipha saunp diya
 Apparently, Brahmastra of Vasundhara has worked
 alaakaman ko jhukna padaa or kataaria ne apni yatra radd kar di
 If Vasundhara showed the red signal, the high command also changed the signal and Kataria's car got punctured before it could start
 dilli main gadakari kii kirakiri hui so alag
 Sources say that many top BJP leaders, including Advani, are angry with Gadkari for asking him to give a green signal to Kataria's visit when he was not aware of the situation
 vasundhara raaje ke sur bhi naram pade hai or unhone maamle ko sulajhaa lene kii baat kahi he, lekin saaf he ki vasundhara ne apane swar tabhi badale hai, jab bijepi alaakaman ne kareeb-kareeb maan liya he ki rajasthan main vahi hoga, jo vasundhara chahengi
 The Indian sports community, including veteran cricketer and honorary Group Captain Sachin Tendulkar of the Indian Air Force, also praised the airstrikes that targeted jaish-e-mohammed militants and camps in Pakistan

 agar saare purush janmajaat aaazaad hai to phir yah kaise mumkin hai ki sari auraten gulam hi paidaa hon? america mul kii nariwadi ‘mairi estail’ kaa yah sawaal yun to bachapan se mere mastishk main jab tab goonjata rahata he
 It is a different thing that i got a chance to know about Mary after coming to journalism
 isse ek baat to saaf he, soch kii simaaen nahin hoti
 All movements ranging from Feminist to lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) genders have grown from 'thinking' of equality and acceptance
 bharat, america, britain se lekar nigeria tak gender kii ladaai duniya ke har kone main ladi gai
 Well, the history of movements ever again
 kyonki is lekh kaa makasad gender kii oonch-neech vaali soch kii kuriti ko kosna nahin, balki isse jude ek adhyayan ke nateezon ko bataanaa he
 The people who are considered to be low-level of gender have been fighting for their rights till now
 aurat-mard kii barabari kaa masalaa khatm hua nahin or ab to gender kaa puraa indradhanush hi saamne khadaa he
 In India too, this entire rainbow has got legal recognition
 lekin jaisaa ki kanoonee adhikaar milane ke dashakon baad bhi aurat-mard ke bich gaiyr barabari kii soch jad jamaaye he, philhal abhi ise puri tarah se badalane main ek jamaana lagegaa
 Well, leave it
 badalte-badalte hi badlaav hota he
 But few people would know that the idea of gender-based non-equality is a big obstacle in the way of our happiness apart from a bad attitude
 yakeen nahin aata to haal hi main hue is adhyayan pard lijie
 a research by Equality of Life: a cross-national Analysis of the Effect of Gender Equality on Life Satisfaction, by Andre Adet and Professor Halley and Corner at Harvard School
 yah adhyayan baqayda aankde muhaiyaa karwaata he ki gender equality yani langik barabari vaale deshon ke mukaable gender inequality yani gaiyr barabari kii soch rakhane vaale desh khushhaali ke index main nichle paaydaan main hai
 You can also say that 'happiness' comes from gender equality
 iske liye gender empowerment mijar (jiiem, gender deveopment index (jidiai), gender inequality index (jiaai), gender gap index (jijii) aadhaarit biological or manovaigyanik pareekshan kiye gaye
 Through them, questions were asked about education, health, salary, politics, industry, movement for the right to vote and many other non-equal indicators
 inase mili aankadon ko life satisphaction yani ‘jindagi main santushti’ ke liye tay maanakon ke aadhaar par vishleshan kiya gaya
 According to the report, life satisfaction also increased among those who moved towards countries with gender equality
 yah keval auraton main nahin badha balki aurat yaa mard donon main life satisphaction kaa str badhata gaya
 For example, the level of life satisfaction was found to be higher among the people of Denmark with a gender equality country than in Japan with a gender inequality
 united state, canada, denmark, japan, newjiland, australia or europe ke desh is adhyayan main shaamil kiye gaye
 In this study only two genders were included, but at a time when many more genders are fighting for equality, the importance of this research increases even more
 khushi or gender equality ke bich kaisaa rist?sawaal, kya khushi or gender equality ke bich koi rist he? to zyaadaatar log jawaab denge, gender equality auraton ke jivan ko behatar banaati he
 Did not just eat
 are bhai pehle tolo, phir bolo
 From the economy to the social, from the psychological to the biological, there are a lot of such gaps where gender equality is considered essential for the progress of the country from prosperity to home
 women, work and iconomi naam se ai ‘international monitory fund’ (iemef) kii report saaf kahati he ki kaarysthal main auraton or mardon ke bich gairbarabari arthvyavastha ke liye ghaatak he
 Gender equity plays an important role in elevating the global economy
 norway se samajashastri oyston gulveg holter kii maane to gender equality vaale deshon ke log ‘avsaad’ jaisi samasya kaa shikaar kam hote hai
 He says, "it is a general belief that giving equal status to women means a reduction in the entitlements of men and the facilities available to them
" yakeen maniye yah keval galatfahami he
 In contrast, 'equal status' is a division of life's responsibilities
 ’’ yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki gender aadhaarit oonch neech kii zanjeeren tootengi to khushiyon ke jharokhe ke saath samruddhi ke dwaar bhi khulenge
 The truth is that the path of making this world transformed into a global village as 'khushistan' goes through this discriminatory thinking wall

 rojgaar badhaane ke liye pichley kaarykaal main mudra lone yojana jaisi skim par bharosa kiya gaya
 Now when the Modi government is formed once again, there is a lot of hope from the youth
 isliye ab sabaki najar is baat par he ki vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman 5 july ko pesh hone vaale bajet main rojgaar badhaane ke liye kya thos yojana pesh karti hai?berogari dar 45 saal ke ucch str par!beete kuch maheenon se bharat main berogari ke aankadon ko lekar bahes chhidi hui he
 Recently the Central Statistics Office (CSO) has released unemployment figures
 in aankadon main bataaya gaya ki desh main berogari dar 45 saal ke ucchtam str par he
 The CSO report was also accepted by the government, but later in Parliament, Labor Minister (independent Charge) Santosh Gangwar called these figures misleading
 haalanki, gangavar ne kaha ki rojgaar srijan sarkaar kii praathamikta he
 Click here for detailed coverage of Budget 2019 'gangwar said that 5,86,728 jobs were provided till 31 March 2019 due to the Prime Minister's Employment Generation Program (PMEGP) and till 31 March 18 under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) 
 26 karod lone baante gaye hai
 Official statistics from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) stated that 7 people seeking employment in the urban sector
 8 fisadi yuva berozegaar hai, jabaki gramin kshetra main yah aankada 5

 berogari kii vajah jaananaa jarurimodi sarkaar ke pratham kaarykaal main agar berogari ucch str par he, to iske kai kaarak hai jinhen jane bina is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 The economy has slowed down

 8 per cent, which is the lowest in the last five years
 menuphaccharing sust ho jane se kaarkaanon kaa rojgaar gata he
 Sales of companies have come down due to reduced consumption
 kaaron kii bikri to aath saal ke nichle str par pahunch gai thi
 Because of this, the corporate world is still hesitant to invest
 apane antim daur main modi sarkaar ne bhi kharchon par ankush rakhaa
 Recruitment was also banned in government departments
 in sab vajahon se rojgaar kaa paryaapt srijan nahin hua or berogari badhati gai he
 What happened in the Interim Budget While presenting the Interim Budget, Union Minister Piyush Goyal had said that the concept of employment is changing around the world
 ab rojgaar srijan sirf kaarkaanon yaa sarkari naukariyon tak simit nahin he
 Now job seekers are becoming job givers
 bharat duniya kaa doosraa sabase bada start-ap hub ban gaya he
 Obviously, the Modi government is still not ready to accept that schemes like Mudra Yojana and Start-up India have not increased employment generation much
 agar aisa hota to berogari kii dar record str par nahin pahunchati
 What will Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman do? The difficulty is that all these challenges of the economy still remain
 aise main unhen rojgaar badhaane ke liye kai morchon par kaam karnaa hoga
 Therefore it will be interesting to see what concrete measures she takes to increase the pace of employment
 sarkaar ab bhi mudra lone, start-ap ko badhaava dene kii baat karegi yaa government, corporate jagat main naukariyon ko badhaane ke liye koi thos upaay karegi?for latest update on mobile SMS < news > to 52424 for Airtel, Vodafone and idea users

 This time in Uttar Pradesh, 10 lakh students have failed in Hindi subject in class x and XII
 yahi nahin ganit main fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya bhi kaaphi zyada he
 The result of the UP board came on 26 April

 People are also surprised to see these results of UP board and the parents are upset

 10 lakh students are failed in UP in 2019 exams
 Who is responsible? Nobody! Because students know well that they can sell tea and Pakaudas and proudly call themselves Deshbhakts
 i really feel sorry for their parents
 Because parents never want to see their children failed
 Bollywood actor Kamal r Khan tweeted about the failure of 10 lakh children in Uttar Pradesh and wrote: '10 lakh students failed in 2019 examinations in UP
 koun jimmedaar he? koi nahin! kyonki chaatr achche se jaanate hai ki ve chaay or pakora bech sakate hai or khud ko garv se deshbhakt bhi kah sakate hai
 i feel sad for their parents
 kyonki mata-pita kabhi nahin chaahate ki unke bachche fail hon

 The BJP Parliamentary Board met at the Prime Minister's residence on Wednesday morning

 There is a meeting of legislative parties in Gujarat on Thursday, in which the parliamentary board will send two observers

 Meetings on the new name continue: After the resignation of Anand Ben Patel, the round of meetings of BJP leaders has started in Delhi

 WATCH: BJP Parliamentary Board meeting underway at pm's residencehttps: / / t
 co / rcnjozjsbf — ANI (@ani_news) August 3, 2016 Signs were found to remove Anandiben
 On March 25, PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah gave a report on the political situation in Gujarat
 report main jaldi hi gujarat ke sarkaar main netritav parivartan kahi gai thi
 If sources are to be believed, Anandi Ben Patel has resigned as Chief Minister on the basis of Om Mathur's report

 If the party sources are to be believed, then the party does not want any such experiment in Gujarat, which will cost the party in the 2017 assembly elections to be held
 sutron kaa ye bhi kahana he ki kisi aise netaa ko gujarat kaa mukhyamantri pad jimmedaari di jaae jo majbootee se vidhansabha main bijepi ko jeet dilaae

 The curiosity of Lok Sabha elections is increasing in public
 raajnneetik dalon kii halchal shabaab par he
 For the first time in the history of independent India, it is seen that the media has thrown everything past, present and future
 lekin phir bhi yah abhi tak saaf nahin ho paaya ki chunaav kaa mukhya mudda kya banegaa
 It has never happened before that counting days are left in the election and it is not known what will become the main issue
 ho saktaa he, chunavi panditon ne kuch bhaanp liya ho, lekin ve abhi bataa na rahe hon
 It may also be that it is waiting that a definite form of alliances first be formed and then a war of war begins
 phir bhi satta or vipaksh kii taraf se maahaul banaae rakhane ke liye ab tak jo kaha gaya he, usase ek mudda zarur nikalakar aa rahaa he - vah he, sarkaar hataao yaa sarkaar bachaao
 Awesome on this issue: It is surprising
 satta or vipaksh donon ne behichak maan liya he ki modi sarkaar ko hataanaa yaa bachaae rakhana hi mudda he
 It is not surprising that it started from the power side
 shaayad maahaul ko bhaanpate hue, sabase pehle sattaruudhon ne hi kahana shuru kiya tha ki vipaksh modi sarkaar ko hataanaa chahta he
 However, this was also ridiculed by the ruling parties
 mazaaq isliye uda tha ki yah saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik tathy he ki raajnneeti main vipaksh hameshaa yahi chahta he
 Whereas issues become the reason why the government should be removed
 haalanki is baar sarkaar ko hataane ke liye dheron mudde banakar taiyaar ho chuke hai
 Especially the slogans that this government came to power in the last election, they are ready as an election issue
 masalan yuvaaon ko naukari ke sapane, kisaanon, chote kaarobaariyon kii khushhaali ke vaade, bhrashtachar mitaane or aise hi dheron anya vaade
 To remove the government, those same promises and slogans were to be electoral issues this time, are being made and will eventually be made
 lekin philhal media ke sajaae chunavi bazaar main bhav gathbandhan ke mudde kaa zyada he
 Especially the issue of coalition of opposition parties
 jabaki is baat main chunavi mudde ke tatv hi nahin dikhte
 Why it cannot become an electoral issue: Coalition has become a common thing in Indian politics
 sattapaksh ho yaa vipaksh, usamen tarah-tarah ke raajnneetik dal shaamil hai
 No one can claim that he will fight all the rest alone
 bharat jaise loktantr main to bilkul bhi nahin
 In a democracy where injustice and exploitation has started on the basis of caste and religion, the gap between the poor and the rich has suddenly widened and the open discrimination between agriculture and industry has increased
 kshetra, bhashaa, khanpan kii vividhtaon or had darje kii aarthik vishmataaon vaale loktantric desh main sabake hiton kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye ijad kii gai gathbandhan kii nayab raajnneeti ko ek raajnneetik vardaan kyon na mana jaae? or agar raajnneetik darshan ke lihaaz se dekhen to loktantr main bhinn-bhinn vichaardhaaraon ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 On this basis, what can be a good alternative to alliance between different ideologies
 or jab paksh or vipaksh ke lagbhag sabhi raajnneetik dal gathbandhan ke darshan ko sweekaar kar rahe hon, to ise loktantr kaa shuklapaksh hi kaha janaa chahie
 But if there is consensus on this subject, then it cannot be an electoral issue at all
 yani chunaav kaa vaastavik mukhya mudda yaa mudde tay hona abhi baaki hai
 But this much is certain: the boom in communalism will remain an issue
 achaanak bhayaavah ho uthi berojgaare chunavi mudda bane bagaiyr rah nahin sakati
 Villages or farmers with more than half the population of the country will become Mudda
 ek alag tareeke se desh kii aadhi aabaadi, yani mahilaon kaa dukh shaayad pehali baar chunavi mudadon kii list main shaamil hone ja rahaa he
 The issue of corruption that has become eternal in politics will not be evicted in this time of elections too, like demonetisation and Rafael
 loksabhaa chunaav main kshetreey or sthaneey str ke tamaam mudadon ko uthaae jane se koi bhi kabhi bhi roak nahin paaya, so, ve is baar bhi rahenge, balki is baar kuch zyada tivrata ke saath uth khadey ho sakate hai, kyonki is baar vipaksh ke gathbandhan kaa mukhya aadhaar kshetreey aakankshaon ko pratinidhitiv dena he
 And this is also certain: For five years, there has been an opportunity from the ruling rulers of the country to say that they will drain the ghee-milk rivers in the country
 vaise bhi lagbhag aisa hi naaraa lagaakar ve satta main aae the
 That is, the opposition should not have to show more dreams or make more promises
 vipakshi gathbandhan ke paas sattaruudhon ke pichley vaadon ko yaad dilaate rahane kaa jaays or sunaharaa mauka uplabdh he
 The ruling will be forced to engage in whatever traditional defenses are available, and if they are weak in defending, then what is left is that the opposition on its own side and through its side media Keep questioning the credibility of
 sarkaar kii ek or mushkil : sattarudh paksh is samay nishchit hi apni mukhya pratidwandvi congress ke dhairyadharan se behad pareshaan honge
 The Congress, with its experienced intelligence, shielded itself from leading the opposition coalition
 apane samay, urja, sansaadhan or saakh bachaate hue usne gathbandhan kaa kaam swaabhaavik rup se hone diya
 The Congress did not interfere much
 is baat se koun inkaar kar saktaa he ki vipakshi gathbandhan kaa jo baari-bharkam kaam ab tak nipta he, vah congress ke hit main bhi jaataa he
 Hence, the ruling coalition has not been able to take the opportunity to attack its main rival Congress till date
 chunavi vishleshkon ko bhoolanaa nahin chahie ki aaj tak loksabhaa kii jin 115 siton par sidhaa muqabla tay dikh rahaa he, unamem zyaadaatar siton par sattaruudhon ko sidhi takkar congress se hi leni padegi
 Not only this, the Congress has kept the option of strategic partnership with the possible alliance for the remaining 430 seats
 kul milakar chunaav purv gathbandhan main jitne jhanjhat hote hai, utane is baar dikh nahin rahe hai
 At least it has been decided that which opposition parties are ready to sit with their partners
 yani yah anumaan lagane kaa ek bada aadhaar uplabdh he ki agar vipakshi dalon ke ek se zyada gathbandhan bhi bane, to un gathbandhanon ke bich bhi saajhedaari kaa vikalp abhi khulaa hua he
 Well, let us see what constitutes the last form of alliance or alliances

 "he said," After April 2, Dalits are being persecuted throughout the country

 During this time, Shatrughan Sinha also talked about leaving the BJP and ignoring the likes of LK Advani and other big leaders in the BJP
 saath hi unhone (shatrughan Sinha) yah bhi bataaya ki aakhir vah ek koun si vajah se thi jisane unhen bijepi ko chhodane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Speaking to NDTV, Shatrughan Sinha said that he had offers from many parties before joining the Congress
 unhone (shatrughan Sinha) kaha ki mere paas aap, mamata banerjee, mayawati, akhilesh ji kii taraf se party jwine karne kaa ofer tha
 Also, Lalu ji's family was also invited
 lekin main unki party main nahin gaya
 One reason for this is that i wanted to join a national party only
 bijepi chhodane ko lekar shatrughna sinha (shatrughan Sinha) ne kaha ki maine party chhodane se pehle main twit kiya tha ki agar aap mujhe hataate hai to newton kaa vah lau bhi yaad rakhiyegaa jisamen kaha gaya he ki har ection kii pratikriya hoti he
 It was because of my tweet that he could not get me out of the party
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki party chhodane kaa nirnay tab liya tha jab meri jagah ravishankar prasad ko patnasahib se tikat de diya gaya
 He said that it was only after i gave tickets to Ravi Shankar Prasad that i thought that enough was enough, i could no longer be in the party
 maine yah dekha tha ki party bade netaaon jaise murali manohar joshi, adwani ji or jashwanth sinha ke saath bhi bura bartaav kar chuki he
 Shutraghan Sinha said that i had already told the party that if i want to be fired, then i will not go myself
 lekin main khudase party isliye chodi kyonki meri jagah patna sahib se ravishankar prasad ko tikat diya gaya
 He said that my first choice was Patna, the second was also Patna and the third was also Patna Sahib
 main ravishankar prasad ke khilaaf nahin hum, wo mere achche dost hai
 But i was angry with the party's decision
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki aaj log samajhate hai jis party ke liye hamanen jaan diya he
 Today the same party is insulting a big leader like Advani
 adwaniji -murali manohar joshi ji ke paas kahin or jane kaa vikalp bhi nahin he
 But i had adwani ji ke saath jo bijepi ke netaa kar rahe hai vah galat he
 He said that advancing the BJP from two seats to two hundred seats is Advani's contribution
 party ke varisht netaaon ne yahi haal arun shouri ke saath kiya, murali manohar ji ke saath kiya
 All this needs thinking, people are watching
 bijepi main van main sho he tu main army he
 There is panic among the big leaders of BJP
 aaj kii bijepi sarkaar main koi kendriya mantri kaam ke nahin he
 The child also does not remember the name of the five ministers
 kyonki sara kaam piemo se ho rahaa he
 We were also ministers, but no one stopped us from doing anything, nor was our work done with the PMO at that time
 shatrughna sinha ne piem modi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki jo log apni hi baat nahin rakh sake, apane vaade hi puure nahin kar sake, jo kisaanon kii haalat hi nahin sudhaar sake, chaahe 15 lakh kaho yaa do karod rojgaar kii baat kaho
 All that could not do
 jo desh kii pukaar nahin sun rahaa he
 Who is not even talking to his people
 raaton-raat jo bager kisi se puche bagaiyr notebandi kar de wo hamaari baat kya sunenge
 Whether it is GST or Rafael, BJP has failed in all areas
 unhone kaha ki maine congress isliye jwine kiya kyonki mahatma gandhi, nehru, patel , indira gandhi, rajeev, rahul kii yah party rahi he jiskaa desh ke aazaadee main bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 Secondly, it is a mainstream party
 yah neshnal party he
 i felt the right path for the National Party
 mere paas aap, mamata banerjee, mayawati, akhilesh ji kii taraf se party jwine karne kaa ofer tha
 Also, Lalu ji's family was also invited
 lekin main unki party main nahin gaya
 Asked if there is no Congress in Bihar, but why did you choose
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki mujhe to lalu ji ke parivaar ne bhi kaha ki abhi aapako hamaare saath nahin aana he to congress ke saath jarur jaaen or congress ko or majboot karen
 This is the reason that this time the Mahagathbandhan had reserved the seat of Patna Sahib for Congress
 kya patna sahib se aapako isliye jeet mili kyonki aap bijepi se the par shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki yah party kii seat nahin he yah bihar kii seat he yahaan jo acha karata he use yah seat milti he
 This seat has also gone to others several times
 yahaan kii janata kerani ke aadhaar par vot dete hai
 If i had won from here by a record margin, he would have won because of everyone
 bijepi dwaara pulavama-balakot ko lekar raashtra kii suraksha ko mudda banane par shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki ye bijepi kaa apana kahana he
 It is part of the bjp's publicity system
 koi hamaare desh main deshadrohi nahin he
 But it was said that the one who did not agree with you became a traitor
 balakot par saboot maange jane par shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki aaj tak kisi ne koi saboot nahin maanga he
 The BJP minister himself has created confusion by making different statements 
 isliye log puch rahe hai ki ab bataa do taaki shahid ke parivaar ko bhi sahaara ho
 On the comparison of the government of the time of PM Modi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Shatrughan Sinha said that there is a lot of difference between the times of Vajpayee ji and Advani ji and today
 us samay lokshahi thi lekin aaj taanaashaahee he
 Today, the party of One Man Show and Two Man Army has remained
 main modi ke khilaaf nahin hum main unki nitiyon or vaadakhilaphi ke khilaaf hum
 He does not hold a single press conference till date
 screepted press conference kii baat nahin he
 Why doesn't he hold a press conference with you or Ravish Kumar
 sawaal poochna deshadroh nahin he
 During the time of Atalji, Advani Ji, the minister was allowed to work
 kaam piemo se nahin hote the
 Today the PMO is doing all the work
 notebandi kii vajah se deshbhar main qatari main lage logon kaa jeena muhaal ho rakhaa he
 But, if you are a VIP, then you can do all the work including opening and bank transfer and changing notes at night

 His staff, including the minister, also accompanied the state cabinet minister, Iqbal Mahmudpure lav-lashkar, associated with the anti-socialist party, to the HDFC Bank branch on Aryasamaj Road late Wednesday evening

 The branch manager said that the bank's time is from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm for customer transactions
 buudhvaar ko din main cash nahin tha, shaam ko 4 baje cash aayaa tobankka time khatm hone ke baad bhi cash badal kar de diya gaya
 When the branch manager was asked why only the minister and the people accompanying him were done, why not the general public, then no answer was received
 mantri bole- maine aam logon kii tarah hi paise badalemantri ikbaal mahmud se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'mere paas paise nahin the to paise lene ke liye bank gaya tha
 Both my sons were also with me
 main jab bank pahunchaa, to bank khulaa tha or vahaan karmchaaree maujuud the
 The minister also claimed that he changed his money just like ordinary people
 notebandi kaa faisla janata virodhiikabal mahmud ne modi sarkaar kii ore se uthaae gaenotbandike faisle ko janata virdohi bataaya
 Iqbal Mehmood said, 'the public is upset with this decision

 The hearing of the membership of 20 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party in the post of profit will now be heard in a double bench
 dilli hoicourt ne vidhayakon kii yachika peeth ke paas bhej di he
 a bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru set the matter for hearing before a bench of the acting Chief Justice yesterday
 kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish gita mittal yaa to nayaa peeth gathit kar sakati hai yaa ise maujuuda do sadasyeey peeth ko saunp sakati hai
 The court has extended the term of its January 24 order
 adaalat ne vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraye jane ke baad khaali hui vidhansabha kii 20 siton ko bharne ke liye upachunaav ke liye chunaav ayog ke adhisuchana jari karne par roak laga di thi
 The court's directive came when advocate Prashant Patel applied to refer the case to a two-member bench
 prashanth patel ne hai court main arji lagaai thi ki is tarah ke maamle single jaj nahin sun sakate, lihaaja ise dabl bainch ko transfar kiya jaae
 It has been said in the application that the Supreme Court has directed that only the Election Petition can hear double bench
 court kaa upachunaav par antarim ste barkaraar rahegaa yani yachika par sunwaayee se pehle dilli kii in siton par chunaav ghoshit nahin kiye ja sakate
 In the case of 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas, the Delhi High Court has said that the matter was again referred to Acting Chief Justice Geeta Mittal and the hearing will now be again in the bench of Sanjeev Sachdeva
 aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon ke nishkasana maamle main dilli hai court main somvaar ko takreeban aadhe ghante tak sunwaayee hui or aadhe ghante tak keval is baat par bahes hoti rahi ki single bench ke court ko is maamle ko sunne kaa adhikaar he yaa nahin? aam aadmi party ke nishkasit vidhayak kailash gahalot ke vakil ve vishvanathan ne court main daleel di ki aap is maamle ko sweekaar karen or maamle kii sunwaayee ke adhikaar aapke paas he
 So, you hear the case
 jabaki jaj vibhu bhaakhru ne supreme court ke ek aadesh kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki is aadesh main saaf-saaf likhaa hua he ki koi bhi maamla jo chunaav se judaa hua he
 It will hear double bench only, while Election Commission lawyer Amit Sharma and central government lawyer Anil Soni also told the High Court that according to the order of the Supreme Court, the matter should be heard only on double bench
 patel kii hi yachika par chunaav ayog ne aap vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane kii raashtrapati ko sifarish kii thi
 This recommendation was later approved by President Ramnath Kovind
 ye yachikaayen aap ke aath vidhayakon ne daayar kii hai, jisamen laabh kaa pad dhaaran karne ke liye party ke 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane vaali centre kii adhisuchana ko chunauti di gai he
 The High Court had earlier summoned the entire record of the proceedings, after which the Election Commission recommended disqualification of 20 AAP mlas and the President approved it on 20 January
 vidhayakon ne jataai thi upachunaav kii ashankabite saptaah buudhvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan vidhayakon kii taraf se kaha gaya tha ki unke saath jo kuch hua he vah anyaay he
 During the hearing, the legislators feared the election would be announced by Monday
 jisapar hoicourt ne chunaav ayog se is masale par somvaar tak upachunaav kii ghoshnaa naa karne ke liye kaha tha
 The mlas argued that the Election Commission did not listen to them and the new Election Commissioner OP Rawat distanced himself from this hearing
 vidhayakon ne daawa kiya ki hamaare khilaaf offis of profit kaa maamla banataa hi nahin he
 The Election Commission should not announce the by-election till the Delhi High Court issues this issue
 raashtrapati ke aadesh ke baad sadsyta ganvaane vaale 20 vidhayakon main se kul 8 purv vidhayakon kii ye yachika lagaai he
 Please tell that these inept mlas have moved the Delhi High Court to cancel the notification of President Ramnath Kovind, after which these mlas of Delhi government have become former mlas

 The Election Commission had already disqualified these mlas
 iske baad 'aap' ne chunaav ayog kii sifarish ke khilaaf dilli hai court kaa darwaja bhi khatkhataya tha
 Where the High Court refused to grant interim relief to the AAP mlas against the recommendation of the Election Commission

 As the sun rose, the life-line of Mumbai was back on track
 mahanagar kii bheed kaa boj uthaane or unhen unki manzil tak pahunchaan ke liye lekin ghadi ne jaise hi 10 bajaae achaanak gorai police stesan ke phone kii ghanti ghanaghna uthi
 The caller told the police that a corpse was lying on Manori beach in Mumbai
 ye laash chunki samandar ke kinare mili thi lihaaja police team phone rakhte hi manori bich kii taraf ravaanaa ho jaati he
 On reaching the beach, the police are blown away by the police officers
 katl ke baad laash ke chehre ko buree tarah se kharaab kar diya gaya tha
 On seeing Manori Beach of Gorai area in Mumbai, the policemen suddenly came in the morning and could also come to the beach
 is laash ko dekhakar laga rahaa tha kii pehle to kisi ne chaakuo se waar kiya or baad me hatyaron ne laash kaa cheharaa bhi paas me hi pade pathar se bigaad diya tha
 The motive of the murderers was clear that in any case, the person who died could not be identified
 mauka e vaardaat par katl main istemaal pathar bhi maujuud tha lekin ye laash kiski he or kaatil koun he iskaa pataa laganaan mumbai police ke badi chunauti bana hua tha
 Initially, the trick of the murderers seemed successful
 laash kaa cheharaa bigad jane se laash ko pahchaanana mushkil ho rahaa tha
 The policemen searched the corpse but nothing was found in the name of the clue
 police waalon kii nazar laash ke paas pade ek mobile phone par padi
 Policemen picked up the mobile and then started the investigation
 mobile ke zariye pataa chalaa kii marane vaale shaks kaa naam ramesh dedhiya he
 Ramesh was a resident of Malwani area of mumbai and is a stockbroker by profession
 ab police apni tafteesh kii pehali seedhi chadh chuki thi lekin kaatil ke girehabaan tak pahunchnaa police ke liye aasaan nahin tha
 The dead body was found on the famous beach of Mumbai
 lihaaja police behad chaukanni thi
 Any laxity in the investigation could have made the case worse
 police ke saamne kai bade sawaal munh failaae khadey the masalan aakhir koun he stock brokar kaa kaatil? kisne use maaraa? or wo koun tha jisane itnaa jokhim uthaa kar katl saream samandar ke kinare kiya? mumbai police ke jehin dimag afasaron kaa imtehaan lene ke liye ek or cese unke saamne aa chukaa tha
 The police wanted to solve the case of murder as soon as possible, but his difficulty was that he had nothing but the identity of Maktool and a single mobile phone which could give a clue to the murderer
 aakhir ramesh kii kisi se aisi kya dushmani thi ki qaatil ne laash kaa cheharaa pathar se buree tarah se kuchal diya tha or sabase bada sawaal ye ki kaatil ne qatl ke liye samandar kaa kinaaraa hi kyon chunaa
 This murder in the middle of Mumbai was a puzzle for the police
 yahi vajah thi ki police jald se jald kaatil tak pahuchanaa chaahati thi lekin mushkil ye thi ki police ke paas laash kii pahchaan or ek adad mobile phone ke alaava aisa kuch bhi nahi tha to kaatil kaa suraag de paata
 After all, who can be hostile to someone who shares broker Ramesh Dedhia, who was put to death
 itani berahami se qatl ke peeche aakhir vajah kya thi or sabase bada sawaal ye ki kaatilon ne katl ke liye samundar kaa kinaaraa hi kyon chunaa
 Since the murder took place on the banks of the sea, the police were not only suspicious but were quite sure that the killer was about to know Dedhia and he called Dediya on the beach and killed him with a knife
 murder kaa ye maamla chaaron taraf se saikadon sawaalon se ghira hua tha jabaki suraag ke naam par police ke haath laga tha to sirf ramesh dedhiya kaa mobile phone
 The mobile phone itself revealed the identity of Dedhia
 police ko ummid thi ki ye mobile phone hi unhen kaatilon tak bhi pahuchaayegaa
 So the police started rushing the phone records of Ramesh Dedhia
 police ko jab dedhiya ke phone kol records mili to use dekh kar police bhuchakki rah gai
 Ramesh used to talk more to his wife's sister i
e
 sister-in-law than he would to his wife
 pehali nazar me police kaa shaq ramesh kii bhanji par hi gaya lekin tabhi police ko ramesh ke kol records me ek or baat dikhi
 His last talk before Ramesh's death was also with Juhi
 juhi ko hiraasat me lene ke liye itnaa shaq police ke liye kaaphi tha or poochtacha ke liye juhi ko hiraasat me liya gaya
 The police started the interrogation
 shuruyaat me police ko juhi ne is hatyakand me kisi tarah se haath hone se saafe inkaar karti rahi lekin jab police ne jab sakhti dikhaai to juhi tut gai or ek sex, sajeesh or katl kii aisi kahani saamne ai jise sunakar sabhi ke hosh ud gayen

 If you want to make a mark in politics, then power is needed and power is necessary for power
 ye bhi sach he ki satta or samarthy kaa yah rasta sarokaaron se hokar gujarata he
 But what to name that concern, whose strength comes from the world of criminality rather than power

 Imagine law and order in Ahmednagar, where underworld don Chhota Rajanaka's brother and local leader Deepak Nikhalje, in front of the SP of the area, asks to slap the policemen and the administration remains silent
 deepak bhaau 'nikhalaaje sanghathan' kaa adhyaksh he
 In fact, three people belonging to the same family hailing from Javakhede Khalsa village in Ahmednagar were murdered on the night of 20 October
 hatyaron ne sanjay jadhav, uski patni jayshri or bete sunil ke shav ko gaanv ke sookhe kuen main phenk diya
 The following morning, a protest against the assassination began and Deepak Nikhalje also became a part of this demonstration
 bataaya jaataa he ki maamle main abhi tak police ne koi karrwai nahin kii, lihaaja logon main gussa he
 'policemen will be beaten within earshot', so the matter is of Netaji, which requires patience
 hajaaron ko saath lekar chalane kii kshamta hoti he
 But in the course of talking to the police, Deepak Nikhalje gives a cold answer
 deepak kahata he, 'hamaare logon kaa khun hua or ulta hamen dabaaya ja rahaa he
 If you do wrong, then anyone will hit the police within earshot
 'ab jaraa gaur kiijie, jis samay yah sab kuch hua us vakt kaaryakartaaon ke alaava vahaan jila ke espi bhi maujuud the, lekin sabhi chuppi saadh gaye
 Not only this, instead of lamenting his statement, Deepak Nikhalje says that if the police do not take action in time and the law and order situation in the state worsens, then the police themselves are responsible for it
 deepak kii dadagirideepak nikhalje kahata he, 'agar hamako kaayda haath main lenaa padaa to koun si galat baat he
 If you do not work, this will happen
 'jaankaree ke mutabik, hatya ke do hafte baad bhi police ne maamle main kisi aaropee ko giraftaar nahin kiya he
 Obviously, the anger of the people is justified in such a situation, but it is not right to say that like a criminal to threaten the police and make noise
 iske saath police kii tauheen par vahaan maujuud varisht police adhikariyon kaa but bane rahanaa bhi kai sawaal khadey karata he
