 Jammu and Kashmir is now a union territory and for the last seventy years the Article 370 under which the valley was given privileges has also been neutralized
 in sabhi faislon ke bich ghati main ab bhi surakshabal tainaat hai, logon ke man main kai sawaal hai
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation to give a message to the people of Kashmir and put his vision in front of the Kashmiri people and the world
 piem modi ke is vijan main thri-di (3D) formula he, jiskaa asar agle kuch dinon main kashmir main dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 This was the first communication of PM after the end of article 370, in which he gave detailed information to the country about this decision and put forward his plan

 Actually, the valley has just been made a union territory, so many political parties have questioned it
 lekin piem modi ne kashmiriyon ko bharosa diya he ki vah apana pratinidhi khud hi chunenge
 Despite being a union territory, Jammu and Kashmir will have its own chief minister, ministers and legislators
 modi kii ore se ye bhi vaada kiya gaya he ki sahi samay aane par jammu-kashmir ko purna rajya banaaya jayega
 With this, the Prime Minister asked the youth of the valley to lead and appealed that there has been familyism for many decades, in such a situation, they themselves come and lead the state
 padhein: jis ranneeti se baaki rajyon main jite, vahi ranneeti jammu-kashmir main apana rahe hai modidusraa di- devlepmentpradhanmantri kaa aglaa focus ghati ke vikaas par rahaa
 He referred to new policies several times and said that due to Article 370, many central schemes could not be implemented in Jammu and Kashmir
 iske alaava ghati main bhrashtachar charam par tha
 But now because the central government will remain there, due to this the development of the valley will get a new height
 piem modi ne is dauraan bollywood, udyogajagat ke logon se jammu-kashmir main nivesh karne kii apil bhi kii
 At the same time, he promised to provide all the facilities of the unionized employees, new dimensions in the sports world, scholarships and other schemes to the state employees at the earliest
 teesraa di: dobhalajammu-kashmir main is vakt jo sabase ahm he wo he vahaan kaa maahaul
 After this decision in the valley, there should be no protest, no problem and the terrorists do not succeed in their plan, so that the central government is paying special attention to security

 The Delhi Police had made elaborate arrangements to stop them, but the anger of the people was such that they broke the police barricading first and then shouted slogans against Delhi BJP MLA Karan Singh Tanwar
 hangaamaa badhata gaya or police ne bheed ko kaabo main karne ke liye water kenon kaa bhi istemaal kiya
 The case dates back to the 15th of August when Karan Singh Tanwar, MLA from Cantt area, organized a colorful program in which the obscene dance was done and on this issue, the Congress Corporation Councilor Sandeep Tanwar demonstrated it and demanded that Rajnath Singh should take action against his MLA Karan Singh Tanwar and expel him from the party

 In the midst of the ruckus on the undergraduate program in DU, the UGC has again issued instructions to all colleges to start enrolling students in their 3-year course
 aapako bataa den ki diu ke 57 collejon ne ujisi ko likhakar suchit kiya he ki wo is aadesh ko maanane ke liye taiyaar hai lekin diu ke 7 collejon ne ujisi ko ab tak koi jawaab nahin bheja he
 On the other hand, UGC has also constituted a Standing Committee
 ye cameti un chaatro ko salaah dene ke liye bani he jo 4 saal ke grajuation course se 3 saal ke grajuation course main aa rahe hai
 Earlier, there was speculation throughout the day on the news of Delhi University VC Dinesh Singh's resignation

 But the news was not so much
 khabar to ye thi ki siesds kii senior phelo madhu kishwar ne ek nayaa or sansanikhej aarope laga diya he
 He said that UGC has threatened Dinesh Singh, VC of Delhi University
 bakaul madhu kishwar ye bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon ke academik itihaas kii abhootpurv ghatana thi, jisane ek saath bahut saare sawaal khadey kar die the
 But the VC has also decided that the fight will continue wherever it is fought

 One is those who are directly opposing the four-year course

 The National General Secretary of Congress and former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijay Singh is not happy with his loved ones these days
 yahi kaaran he ki vah apane ko duubataa hua suraj or hath ko nuksaandaayak bataane se bhi nahin hichak rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh is one of the most powerful leaders in the Congress politics of Madhya Pradesh
 beete do dashak main rajya main congress kii raajnneeti main vahi hua he, jo unhone chaha he
 There has been some change in the situation before the upcoming assembly elections, the Congress has unannounced a new face by making Union Minister of State Jyotiraditya Scindia the chairman of the election campaign committee
 party ne ek taraf jahaan sindhiya ko aage kiya he, vahiin sindhiya or kendriya shahari vikaas mantri kamalnath kii jugalbandi ne digvijay singh ko rajya main kaaphi kamjor kiya he
 It is also visible
 yahi kaaran he ki unhen beete dinon congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii chaar reliyon main pichhali qatari main baithna padaa he
 It is also considered by some as part of the strategy
 digvijay singh ne gwalior kii sabha main rahul gandhi kii maujuudagi main apni naaraazgi bhi apane hi andaaj main jaahir kii thi
 He said, 'who worships the setting sun, we all bow to the rising sun that is on the stage
 ' itnaa hi nahin indore main to unhone sweekaar bhi kar liya tha, ki duubataa suraj ve hi hai
 In Gwalior's meeting, where Digvijay described himself as the setting sun, he said that he never speaks on stage in front of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, but he has to speak in front of Bal Hatha
 vahiin guuruuvaar ko twitor main hath ko nuksaandaayak bataakar nae sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Digvijay, in his tweet, has attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for his comment on the Sobhan government and then retaliated without naming him
 is twit main digvijay ne ek taraf modi par hamalaa bolaa he to duusari ore hath ko nuksaandaayak bataaya he
 a look at the tweet of Digvijay Singh
 
 
 'badbhole' ji funs gaye, kahkar ise majaak,dharm bhiru janata hui, sunakar ise awak
 Hearing this, he became speechless and quickly understood
 vot bank jo thos, use naaraaz karaayaa
 Say 'akhil' Kavirai, quickly turned around, 'karat saint honor', giving a lot of cleanliness
 aage karen vichaar, aaj maani to maani
 Say 'akhil' Kavirai, Tarunai is necessary
 par anubhav ke bina, safalataa kisne pai?hath koi bhi, he buree, soch samajhakar maan,bal, triya or raaj hath, karti he nuksaan
 Causes loss, always says Gyani madhya pradesh ke varisht patrkaar shiv anuraag pateriya kaa kahana he ki digvijay singh chatur rajaneta he
 His statements and tweets can be part of the strategy and expressing displeasure
 saath hi party ko sandesh bhi dete hai ki yuvaaon ko aage badhaane ke saath anubhav ko lekar chalanaa hoga
 Digvijay Singh's displeasure coming before the assembly elections in the state can become a hindrance in the ongoing efforts for unity in the Congress, as there is no shortage of his supporters in the state

 Legend Birthday of Emperor Munshi Premchand was celebrated in his village Lamhi
 sarkari mahakamon ne farz adaayagi kii, to privet skool, rangakarmi, sahityakaron or patrakaron ne bhi ek din ke liye kathakaar ko yaad kiya
 Now all of them will leave them for the entire year
 tamaam ghoshnaaon ke baavjood munshi premchand kaa ghar or gaanv aaj bhi upeksha kaa shikaar hai or jo kuch bana bhi he, vah bas yun hi khadaa he, bina kisi kaam ke
 On Munshi ji's birth anniversary, his characters Hori, Madhav, Ghisu's deepest condolences to the artist were missing through the play
 lamahi main har saal unka janm diwas manaaya jaataa he
 On behalf of the government department, the duty also provides tents for the payment, there are also events at the memorial site and there is a fair atmosphere in the village, but there is a pain within the villagers on one day's love for the narrator
 suresh chandra dube bataate hai, dard is baat kaa he ki saal main ek baar mahotsav kaa rup le letaa he, lekin uske baad premchand koun hai, kahaan hai, kisi ko khabar tak nahin hoti
 People feel that there will be a lot going on in Premchand's villages, but there are disappointments when they come here
 lagata he, premchand aam aadmi ke lekhak the, aam hi rah gaye, khaas nahin ho paae
 In Lamahi village, Munshi Premchand's house in the courtyard where gheesu, diamond, cow dung, coriander was born, has been painted on the wall of that house on the day of birth anniversary
 deevaaron par unke paatro kii painting tangi hai, or log dekhne bhi aa rahe hai, lekin saal bhar yah makaan badahaal rahata he
 It is not that the governments did nothing in the name of Munshi
 kai yojanaayen baniin, unheen main pichhali sarkaron ke prayaas se takreeban do karod kii laagat se munshi ji ke ghar ke thik saamne ek shodh santhaan bana
 Buildings and other resources were also provided, and it was handed over under the supervision of the Hindi department of BHU, but for the last four years it has been spewing havoc
 lamahi main har taraf avyavashtha dikhti he
 The characters of Munshi Premchandra, sitting at Lamhi's gate, are also not disappointed by the year-long neglect
 parivaar se upekshit budhi kaaki bhi apni ankhon main sapane liye ek pal kaa pyaar dhund rahi hai or vah yah pyaar un logon se dhund rahi hai, jo munshi ji ke sahitya parampara ke asal vaahak hai, lekin aate saal main sirf ek din hai
 Professor Sadanand Shahi of the Hindi Department says that we should fulfill the social responsibility of loving our author and cherishing his writer, keeping his memories alive, which we are not able to do
 vidmbana yah he ki munshi premchand kii jayanti se chaar din pehle unke ghar kii bijli isliye kaat di gai, kyonki 14 saal se bill kaa bhugtan nahin hua tha
 When this news came to the media, instant power was added like that
 kyonki koi vibhaag isaki zimmedaari nahin le rahaa tha
 It is worth mentioning that earlier this house and the memorial of Premchand ji were near the Nagari Pracharini Sabha, but then they gave it to the Municipal Corporation, the Municipal Corporation also later gave it to the Varanasi Development Authority and now when this dispute has come up So, the District Magistrate handed it over to the Culture Department and now they are planning to adopt this village and bring it on the big plank of the country

 There is a lion - 'enmity fiercely, but there is so much scope that whenever there is friendship, do not be ashamed
 ’ lekin barason saath rahebijapi or jediumen dushmani itani gahari ho gai he ki raajnneeti main donon partiyaan ab ek-duusare ko nicha dikhaane main sharmindagi kii lakshmana rekha bhi laangh rahe hai
 In response to the report card of Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, when the BJP released the report card, the cartoon printed on that report card drew a new Laxman Rekha of enmity between the two parties
 argedy pramukh lalu yadav kaa pair pakade nitish ke cartoon ne bihar kii siyasat ko garma diya he
 Cartoons have been the subject of discussion all over Bihar and this is enough to tease Nitish Kumar directly
 shaayad bijepi chaahati bhi yahi he
 But the BJP is not going to stop here, it is now preparing to hang this cartoon on every city, village, square and squares and streets
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mangal pandey kaa kahana he, ‘hamane to sachai cartoon ke madhyam se logon ke saamne rakh di he, ab janata chaahegi to kal se ise chowk-chauraahon par bhi taangegi
 Actually, the story behind the curtain is that former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's attacking style of Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues
 apni sampark yatra main nitish kumaar, modi ke kaledhan par die gaye chunavi bhaashan kii audiyon sidi or ‘man kii baat’ ke audio sunaakar modi par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Not only this, Nitish is calling BJP as 'kanfunkwa Party' instead of his name and Nitish's style here is piercing BJP
 isi ke jabaab main bijepi ne bhi sidhe-nitish ko nishane par liya he or vah bhi raajnneetik maryaada ko taak par rakhkar
 However, while the Opposition is busy calling this BJP cartoon a low-level politics, the BJP is considering it as its trumpcard
 party ab nitish ke jawaab main na sirf in postaron ko taangegi, balki lalu yadav ke us bhaashan ke ansh bhi sunayegi jisamen lalu ne vidhansabha upachunaavon main nitish ko apane pairon main giraane kii baat kahi thi, taaki apane cartoon ko sachai se jod saken
 It is clear that even if the level of politics falls, both the parties will not leave any chance to degrade each other
 bhartiya vayusena kii air strike ke baad se hi pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he or apni napak harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 On Wednesday morning, Pakistan again proved that if India will wipe out terrorists for its self-defense, then Pakistan will target Indian soldiers and innocent civilians to save those terrorists
 pakistan kii kyrana harakat ke baad se centre sarkaar sakriy ho chuki he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in a big statement that if the US can kill Osama then India also has the ability to kill Masood Azhar in Pakistan itself
 itane bade bayaan ke baad ye jaananaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki america ne 2011 main kis tareeke se osama ke aatank kaa safaya kiya tha or kya bharat bhi kuch aisi karrwai masood ke khilaaf kar paaegaa?to chaliye aaj jaanate he itihaas ke sabase bade oparation kii kahani or samajhate hai bharat kii takat-america par 11 sitambar 2001 ko hua tha aatmghaatee aatanki hamalaa
 This is one of the biggest terrorist attacks in history
 is hamale main 2996 logon kii maut hui thi or badi sankhya main log jakhmi ho gaye the
 The attack was claimed by Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda's mentor
 itane bade aatanki hamale ke baad america puri tarah hill gaya or badale kii bhaavana uske andar dhadhakane lagi
 Then began the largest operation of US intelligence agencies
 2001 main hamale ke baad se hi osama bin laden faraar ho gaya
 First he went to Afghanistan, then from there he made his base in the hills of Tora Bora
 9 saal tak osama isi tareeke se america agenciyon kii aankh main dhul jhonkta rahaa
 He kept his terrorist activities hidden in a village in Pakistan
 lekin saal 2010 main america agency ke haath laga osama kaa sabase bharosemand sandeshvahak, jiske madhyam se unhone apane is mishan ko safatapurvak puraa kiya
 Let me tell you, for a long time some Pakistanis were working for the Central Intelligence Agency of America
 unheen logon ne july 2010 main osama ke us sandeshvahak ko peshawar main white sujuki gaadi main dekha tha
 As soon as this information was received, the American agency came into action and they monitored the activities of that person for a long time
 us sandeshvahak kaa peechha karte-karte agenciyaan aa pahunchi abtabad jahaan osama bin laden ke chhip kar rahane kii pushti hui thi
 Now the operation started from here, Neptune Spear and the commandos of the US Navy Seal set out to eliminate Osama
 kaise hua tha ye oparation1
 79 US helicopters took off from Jalalabad area in Afghanistan
 2
 Abbottabad, the commando of the Navy SEAL, arrived at one o'clock in the night
 vahaan unka ek helicopter ummid se jaldi neeche utar gaya or uskaa pichhlaa bhaag ek diwaar se takaraa gaya
 But there were no injuries in this incident and the operation proceeded according to strategy
 3
 Then those commandos started firing from the back door of the guesthouse
 pataa chalaa ye goliyaan osama kaa sandeshvahak abu ahamed kuwaiti daag rahaa tha
 The commandos immediately killed him
 is ghatana main abu kii patni bhi maari gai
 4
 iske baad ve commando guestaouse kaa mukhya dwaar uda dete hai or pehali manzil kii taraf kooch karte hai
 On reaching there, they also kill the messenger's brother
 5
 The operation goes ahead and Osama's son Khalid is also killed
 uskaa betaa jaise hi navy sil kii taraf hamalaa karne kii koshish karata he, commando usko maut ke ghat utaar dete hai
 6
 ab oparation apane antim charan par pahunchataa he or osama ko maarane ke liye kooch karata he
 As Seal Navy commandos approach the third floor, they see Osama standing with an AK-47 in his hand
 usee samay sil navy us dehshatgard ko turant maar giraati he
 Let us tell you, Osama's left eye and chest were hit by bullets and he immediately died
 7
 After this Osama's picture was also taken and sent to the US authorities
 12 ghante ke bheetar hi osama bin laden kii body ko thikaane laga diya gaya
 Explain that his body was thrown into the northern Arabian sea
 to is tareeke se america ne apana 9 / 11 kaa badla puraa kiya or alqaida kaa hukmran osama bin laden maaraa gaya
 Now after the statement of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, there is hope that India can take some similar action
 vaise bharat kii khufia agency bahut sakriy he or is tareeke kaa kaam karne kii kshamta bhi rakhti he
 Let me tell you, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) also keeps a close eye on 87 percent of Pakistan's area and keeps sending HD quality pictures to our agencies
 yahi nahin hamaari vayusena ne to apana parakram dikhaa hi diya he
 He has proved that he can hit the exact target in a short time
 bataa den, jo miraj 2000 bhartiya vayusena ne air strike main prayog kiye the, ve atyant hi shaktishaalee vimaan he
 The Mirage can fly at a speed of 2000 per hour with 13,800 kg of ammo at a time
 vaise 2015 main ye vimaan apgrade bhi ho chuke hai
 Apart from this, the Indian Air Force also has Dhasu aircraft like mig 21, mig 27 and Jaguar
 bharat lagaataar apane radar system ko bhi majboot kar rahaa he
 Apart from the Air Force, the Indian Army and Navy are very strong and always ready to carry out any type of attack
 is samay pakistan kii baukhalaahat kaa yahi matlab he ki wo jaanata he ki uski sainya shakti bharat ke saamne nahi tik sakati he
 So the meaning is clear, India has technology as well as military force
 ab agar sarkaar kii taraf se majboot ichhashakti dikhaai jaae to bharat bhi jaish ke hukmran masood ajahar kaa safaya kar sakati he

 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal has written a letter to the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, recalling Nirbhaya and urging them to work together on women's safety, ignoring the tussle between the central government and the Delhi government
 swati maliwal ne jab se mahila ayog kaa bhaar sambhala he tab se hi wo centre sarkaar, dilli sarkaar, mahila ayog or dilli police ke pratinidhiyon kii ek hai level cameti banane kii maang kar rahi hai
 Although no such committee has been formed yet, Swati has once again recalled the incident of the Nirbhaya gang rape and demanded the Prime Minister to strengthen the safety of women to form a committee that ensures the safety of women at the earliest
 Can do
 aadarneey pradhanmantri ji,main aapako bahut hi ummid or aashaa ke saath yah patr likh rahi hum
 Even after four years of the tragic incident of Nirbhaya rape in Delhi on 16 December 2012, women and girls are still not safe in Delhi
 aaj chaar saal ke baad bhi jamini str par sthiti main koi khaas badlaav nahin hua he
 Even today, three-year-old girls are being raped in Delhi and crime against women is increasing
 pichley maheene 21 navambar ko ek 4 saal kii bacchee kaa rape karke uski hatya kar di gai
 The next day, a 3-year-old girl was raped and tried to kill her
 usase kuch hafte pehle ek 11 maheene kii bacchee ke saath 2 ghante tak balaatkaar hua
 Today, 6 girls are becoming fearless in Delhi every day
 dilli duniya main rape capital ke rup main jaani jane lagi he
 Sir, the crime statistics found on the crime of women from Delhi Police shows that 31446 firs were registered against women in the year 2012 to 2014 and only 146 people were punished
 yah saaf dikhaata he ki dilli main aparaadhiyon ke man main koi dar nahin he ki agar wo galat karenge to system unhen bakhshega nahin
 Even Nirbhaya has not got justice yet
 pichley dinon nirbhaya kii maa mujhase mili to unhone mujhase gusse main kaha ki kabhi kabhi unhen lagata he ki thik hua unki beti mar gai nahin to ab tak nyaay na milane ke kaaran shaayad ghut ghut kar mar jaati
 This is a shameful thing for this country
 unka dukh desh kii har nirbhaya or uske parivaar kaa dukh he
 Sir, i think that if the criminal who commits a crime against women gets punished in any case and soon, then there will be improvement
 iske liye yuddh str par police kii javabdehi badhaane kii jarurat he or saath main police ke sansaadhan bhi
 Apart from this, there is also a need to increase forensic labs and courts
 yah sab tabhi sambhav hoga jab centre va dilli sarkaar saath milakar kaam karenge
 Right now the women and girls of Delhi have to bear the brunt of the mutual mess of the Central and Delhi Government
 is vakt dilli main mahila suraksha par aisi koi prabhaavshaalee cameti nahin he jo centre va rajya sarkaar ko saath kaam karne ke liye baadhya kar sake or mahilaon ke hit main nirnay liye ja sake
 If there was such a committee, i am sure that the crime against women in Delhi would come down and increase the accountability of the police, digitalizing police records, forming a police station level committee, installing street lights, building toilets, the Victim Compensation Scheme implemented Doing, stopping the prostitution, getting the CCTV camera done in Delhi could be done at a speed
 is uljhi hui sthiti ko sulajhane ke liye dilli mahila ayog pichley dedh saal se centre sarkaar se guhaar laga rahaa he ki dilli main mahilaon kii suraksha par centre va rajya ke bich samanvay ke liye ek hai level cameti kaa gathan kiya jaae jisamen mananeey kendriya grih mantri, mananeey up rajyapal, dilli ke mananeey mukhyamantri, dilli police kamishnar or dilli mahila ayog ko shaamil kiya jaae
 So that the Central and Delhi governments come on a platform every month to take concrete decisions to ensure the safety of women of Delhi
 abhi to haal ye he ki dilli main mananeey up rajyapal ne pichley ek saal main central home ministry ke kehane ke baad bhi mahila suraksha par ek bhi meeting nahin bulaai he
 To improve the security of women in Delhi after the Nirbhaya rape incident, the Union Home Ministry had constituted a special task force comprising Home Ministry officials, Delhi Government officials, Delhi Police and Delhi Women headed by the Home Secretary
 The commission was also included
 is cameti kaa makasad centre va dilli sarkaar ke bich main mahila suraksha par samanvay sthapit karnaa tha
 But in the month of July this year, this Special Task Force was also stopped, saying that the committee for the purpose of women safety was completed
 yah bahut durbhagyapurna he
 3 thousand crore rupees of Nirbhaya fund created after the Nirbhaya rape incident has not been spent till now
 dilli sarkaar ne ditisi bason main sisitivi lagane ke liye centre se july 2015 main nirbhaya fund maanga tha lekin ajtak ye fund unako nahin mila
 Sir, earlier we had written a letter to suggest that Nirbhaya fund should be used for smooth use of CCTV in police stations, schools, colleges and buses of the country
 forensik lab or van stop centre banane ke liye, maanav taskari va acid atake peeditao ke punarvaas ke liye or nari niketan main rahane vaali mahilaon va bacchiyon ke kalyaan ke liye bhi nirbhaya fund kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The Delhi Women's Commission believes that the Nirbhaya fund can be used smoothly only if the fund is distributed among the states and the High Level Committee of the Center and the State in Delhi decide on it
 main aapkaa dhyaan dilli mahila ayog kii ore bhi aakarshith karnaa chaahati hum
 In the last one year, the Delhi Commission for Women has seen 12 thousand cases
 3
 1
6 million calls have been attended on the 181 helpline
 hamaari team ne 7500 mahilayon ke ghar jaakar unki madad kii he
 55 recommendations have also been given to the Central and State Government by the Women's Commission aapako jaanakar bahut khushi hogi ki dilli mahila ayog desh kaa pehla mahila ayog he jo shanivaar ko bhi kaam karata he
 But today the Delhi Women's Commission is under attack from all sides
 desh kii sansad se teen kilometre kii duuri par sthit jibi road par vaishyalay chal rahe hai jahaan roj choti-choti maasoom bacchiyon kii aabru ko ronda ja rahaa he
 Every girl has to sleep with 30-30 people
 jab dilli mahila ayog ne is maanav taskari ke dhandhe ko khatm karne kaa bidaa uthaaya to ham par do juthi FIR darj kara di gai
 We should not work towards this and hence such false cases were filed
 itnaa hi nahin dilli mahila ayog kii swaittata ko khatm karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The salary of the staff working here has been withheld for three months
 mahila ayog main acid atake peedit, anaath ladkiyaan va anya peeditaayen bhi naukari karti hai un sab kii bhi selary roak di gai he
 Today, there is a shortage of pie in their house
 dilli mahila ayog ke rape chrysis cell, 181 vimen helpline, mobile helpline aadi program band hone ke kagaar par he
 Today, rape is not stopping in Delhi, but an illegal attempt is being made to close the Delhi Women's Commission
 sar, dilli kii yah beti dilli kii mahilaon ke man kii baat is patr ke madhyam se aap tak bahut aashaa se pahunchaa rahi he
 i request you to take cognizance of this letter and immediately set up a High Level Committee on Women Safety in Delhi
 mai aapse nivedan karti hoon ki aap mujhe milane kaa bhi samay den taaki main dilli main mahilaon kii suraksha kaa sunishchit karne main aane vaali samasyaon ko vistaar se aapako avgat kara sakun
 There is a debate in the country about triple talaq at this time
 ol india muslim personal lau board or sarkaar isko lekar aamane-saamne he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has written a blog on this whole matter, presenting the government's stand
 jetali ke mutabik, teen talaak or kaaman civil code donon alag mudde hai
 Any personal law should be according to the constitution
 teen talaak kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata alagajetali ne kaha, 'teen talaakki sanvaidhanik vaidhata or samaan aachaar samhita puri tarah alag he
 The government's view is clear
 personal lau samvidhan ke hisaab se hi hona chahie
 Three divorces should also be judged on the scale of living with the right to equality and respect
 ye kehane kii jarurat nahin ki doosrepersonal lopper bhi yahi paimaana lagu hota he
 The PM said- Equal rights should be given to women
 Earlier, the Prime Minister also said that women of all religions should get equal rights
 uske baad venkaiya naidu or duusare mantriyon ne bhi teen talaak ormuslim personal lau bordco lekar apni sthiti saaf kii thi
 Now Jaitley is also trying to clear the same issue that both triple talaq and Muslim personal law are different
 jabaki, muslim personal lau board is mudde par kah rahaa he ki yah ek dharmik masalaa he
 The government should not interfere in this

 balakrishna ramnagara jila kii magdi vidhansabha seat hai-ramesh bandi siddegoda mandya jila kii shrirangpattavidhansabhasit hai-bhima nike balleri jila ke hazaribommanhalli vidhansabha seat hai What is tradition or ritual? Ideally, it is just a practice
 jo kisi ek ne shuru kii
 Someone else copied her and then she became a poet
 bina is baat kii parvaah kiye ki kya sahi he kya galat
 Understand the practice of logic, which is not available
 jis tarah ye zaruri nahin he ki har parampara galat ho
 In the same way, it is not necessary that every tradition is correct
 desh bhar main aisi kai paramparaayen maujuud hai, jinke pairon tale rondi ja rahi he insaaniyat
 They say that Guy goes over them and they don't even know
 unka kahana he ki yahaan har mannath puri hoti he
 Never goes empty
 ye reet sadiyon se chali aa rahi he
 Their children will also run it
 bahut se lomondhvishwaasakahate hai magar hamaari shraddha he
 After this, end the whole debate here
 kyonki aasthaa or shraddha ke maamle main sawaal nahin kiye jate
 Otherwise you will be called unrighteous
 zaahir he hamaare desh main aasthaa or dharm ko sar ankhon par rakhaa jaataa he
 But think of it, the cow passing by next to you on the road should shake your head a little
 to khauf kii vajah se aapkaa yakeen pal bhar main badal jaataa he
 Shivarandaudari is in the body
 to phir yahaan kyon nahin
 So the squeeze of all the struggle is that if the cow passes by keeping the feet on top of your body
 to samajhie aapkaa saalon purana udhaar chuktaa ho gaya
 It will happen if marriage or child is not happening
 naukari nahin he to lag jaaegi
 Overall, whatever the vow will be, it will be fulfilled here
 yahaan log maanate hai ki isse sari pareshaani dur ho jaati hai
 All wishes are fulfilled
 ab is parampara ko is par yakeen karne waalon kii nazaron se dekhie to inaki daleel he ki jab janm dene vaali maa ke paanv ke neeche jananath ho sakati he
 Then the cow mother whose body is inhabited by 33 crore Gods and Goddesses, cannot she fulfill her vow
 aasthaa ho to mumkin he
 That is why in the beginning you were told clearly that in the matter of faith and reverence, we do not ask questions
 ab aaiye samajhate hai ki ye parampara aakhir he kya
 Actually Bhidavad is a village in Ujjain district of Madhya Pradesh
 parampara ke mutabik diwali ke duusare din yahaan govardhan puja hoti he
 a tradition prevails here on this special occasion
 is parampara ke mutabik chaar hazaar kii aabaadi vaale is gaanv main un aath logon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he, jinhen mannath maangani he
 This election is done according to the Mayar of Mannat
 puja archana ke baad subah-subah in chune gaye logo kaa juluus niklaa jaataa he
 And then they are laid at the crossroads in the village
 jiske baad shuru hota he gaanv kii saji dhaji gaayon kaa in par se guzarane kaa silsilaa
 According to this tradition, those seeking a vow in the temple of Mata Bhavani have to leave the house 5 days in advance and come to the court of the mother
 5 din shraddha bhav se mandir main rahane ke baad unhen maa gauri yani gaayon ke aashirwad ke liye taiyaar kar ke zamin par lita diya jaataa he
 However, the head of these people is covered with a blanket so that the legs of the cow are not hurt
 ab ise aasthaa kahana he yaa andhvishwaas ye aap tay kar lijie magar ise maanane waalon ke liye ye dil ke bahut kareeb he
 Perhaps this is why this tradition has been going on for years here
 gaanv waalon kaa kahana he ki unki is parampara se ab tak to koi zakhmi nahin hua he or aage bhi nahin hoga
 Perhaps this belief of his did not allow this tradition to weaken over time
 logon kii aasthaa ab bhi is jaanaleva pratha par bani hui he
 According to them, if even one foot of cow mother fell on them, then all their wishes will be fulfilled
 or gauri mata kaa aashirwad hameshaa bana rahegaa

 But i became very impatient
 "shraddha ne kaha ki jab vah waapas bharat aa gayi to unhen ofer milane lage
 Audition offers, not film offers

 gujarat ke somnath mandir ke visitor book main sin karne ko lekar rahul gandhi ne bijepi par sidhe hamalaa bolaa he
 Addressing a public meeting in Amreli, Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi said that he had signed in Somnath's visitor book, but in the second book, people of BJP had signed him
 bijepi par karaara palatwaar karte hue kaha, ''ham dharm kii dallali nahin karte hai
 My grandmother and my family are Shiva devotees
 ham dharm kaa istemaal raajnneetik phaayde ke liye nahin karte hai
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that religion is a private thing
 ham dharm kaa vyapaar nahin karte hai
 He said, "I had signed in a visitor book of Somnath temple, but in the second visitor book, BJP people had signed me
 ''darasal,rahul gandhi ne somnath mandir main darshanakarne pahunche the, to vahaan gaiyr-hindu darshanathiyon ke liye rakhe register main sin kar diya tha
 Those people who are not Hindus sign in this register
 isko lekar bijepi ne rahul gandhi ke dharm ko lekar sawaal uthaae the

 unhone kaha ki donon ne hi hindustan ko banane kaa kaam kiya
 Krishna Kumar Singh gave his land and Sardar Patel took this land for Hindustan
 unhone desh ko banaaya
 Taking a dig at the PM, Rahul Gandhi said that Modi talks about Sardar Patel and is making his idol, but what is done by Sardar Patel and Krishna Kumar, Modi is walking the opposite path
 unhone kaha ki krishna kumaar ne kisaan ko adhikaar kiya, lekin modi ne gujarat ke logon se saadhe lakh acre jameen chhinakar kuch udyogpatiyon ko de diya
 PM Modi does politics about Sardar Patel, but does not act like Sardar Patel

 After all what happened at the temple? Rahul Gandhi arrived in Gujarat on Wednesday for a two-day visit

 Something happened in the temple that when reaching the Somnath temple, when it was asked on behalf of the temple that people who are non-hindus sign in a separate register, then the media co-ordinator present on behalf of Congress, Ahmed Patel and Rahul Gandhi's name told
 iske baad donon netaaon ko us register main sin karne ke liye kaha gaya
 The mistake of the Media Co-ordinator? The thing which is getting viral in the signature picture is that Rahul's name is written there
 saaf andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki naam ke aage ji laga he to rahul ne khud to sin nahin kiye hai
 It is being said that media co-ordinator Manoj Tyagi had written the names of the two leaders on the register

 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Team India has suffered a big defeat in the opening match of the World T20
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ab semi final main pahunchane ke liye baaki teenon match jeetne honge or sirf jeet se hi kaam nahin banane vaala he
 a big win will have to be recorded, only then will it be guaranteed to go to the semi-finals
 team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kehete hai ki kiwi team ke khilaaf badi haar kaa team ko khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he, kyonki ab sirf jeet se hi nahin balki bade antar se jeet darj kerani hogi tabhi jaakar agle daur main pahunchane kii ummid bandhegi
 Dhoni said that recently there was a T20 World Cup in which Team India was eliminated from the tournament after losing just one match
 
 The World Cup which the captain is referring to was played in Sri Lanka in 2012
 
 
 vahaan team india ko australia ke haathon mahaz ek haar mili thi
 
 uske alaava gp stage ke baaki 4 maichon main bharat ne afghanistan, england, pakistan or dakshin africa ke khilaaf jeet darj kii thi lekin uske baavjood team india toornament se baahar ho gai thi This wound is still fresh in Dhoni's mind and this time the group is even more difficult
 australia jaisi top team, asia cap final main pahunchane vaali bangladesh team or pakistani team jo kabhi bhi kisi bhi team ko haraa sakati he
 There is bound to be pressure on Team India in the match against Pakistan after the defeat against the Kiwi team, but the captain has some more opinions on it
 tippaniyan Dhoni said that we are not saying or thinking anything like that
 jahaan tak baat jeet ke dabaav kii he to vah to har match main rahegaa, kyonki yahaan se ab karo yaa maro kii sthiti he, jisamen sabhi match team india ke liye jeetna zaruri he
 The meaning is clear, 'do or die' from here every match has to be played as a knockout match
 haare to vishwa vijeta banane kaa sapana tuutegaa or jite to ummid bandhegi
 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni says that a big defeat against the Kiwi team may have to bear the brunt, as now it is not just to win but also to win by a big margin only then the hope of going to the next round will be tied
 dhoni ne kaha ki haal hi main ek tii-20 vishwa cap aisa bhi rahaa tha jisamen team india mahaz ek match haarane ke baad toornament se baahar ho gai thi
 
 captain jis vishwa cap kaa zikr kar rahe hai wo 2012 main srilanka main khelaa gaya tha
 
 
 Team India had lost just one defeat to Australia there
 
 Apart from this, India had won against Afghanistan, England, Pakistan and South Africa in the remaining 4 matches of the GUP stage, but despite that Team India was eliminated from the tournament
 dhoni ke jahan main yah ghaav abhi bhi taaja hai or is baar to group or bhi mushkil he
 Top teams like Australia, Bangladesh team reaching the Asia Cup final and Pakistani team who can beat any team at any time
 kiwi team ke khilaaf haar ke baad pakistan ke khilaaf mukaable main team india par dabaav hona lajimi he, lekin captain is par kuch or raay rakhte hai
 The comments dhoni ne kaha ki ham to aisa kuch nahin kah rahe na soch rahe hai
 As far as the pressure of winning is concerned, it will remain in every match, because from here to now there is a do or die situation, in which all the matches are necessary for Team India to win
 matlab saaf he, 'karo yaa maro' yahaan se har match nokout match kii tarah khelnaa hoga
 If you lose, the dream of becoming a world winner will be broken and if you win, hope will be tied
 dhoni ne kaha ki haal hi main ek tii-20 vishwa cap aisa bhi rahaa tha jisamen team india mahaz ek match haarane ke baad toornament se baahar ho gai thi

 mumbai police ne ek naukaraani ko giraftaar kiya he, jo apane maalik ko lagatarsex kii recordingko lekar blackmel kar rahi thi
 Made told the owner of the house that i had recorded the sex of both of us

 This maid was working at her house for the last few years

 Hearing this, dgm's wife suffered a heart attack

 is baar republic de parade par abu dhabi ke crown prince piem modi ke mehmaan honge
 The invitation of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan from India for this program and accepting it from their side is of great political importance
 piem modi ek ore samrik morche par majbootee ke liye pashchimi deshon ko saadhane kii koshish main he to iconomi, dephence jaise kshetron main bharat kii pahunch badhaane ke liye yuai se rishte majboot karne main jute hai
 PM Modi invited the Crown Prince with two arrows
 haalanki, ise pichley saal piem modi kii abu dhabi or dubai yatra ke 'ritern' ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he lekin aise samay main jab bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav he, abu dhabi ke crown prince ke bharat daure ke elaan se bada sandesh gaya he
 Like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, or UAE, has been an old strategic ally of Pakistan
 yuai, saudi arab or pakistan hi aise teen desh the jinhone afghanistan main talibani shashan ko manyata di thi
 But a lot of time has passed since that time
 yuai or saudi arab kepakistanke rishton main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he
 Both of them have come very close to India on the issue of security and counter-terrorism
 republic de ke maukey par abu dhabi ke prince ko nyotaa dekar piem modi ne 'madhya purv' ko lekar apni ranneeti main nayaa daanv khelaa he
 The Crown Prince has considerable influence in the uae's security and geopolitical policy formulation
 wo yuai kii sashastr senaaon ke supreme commander bhi rah chuke hai
 Abu Dhabi has a sizeable population of the Indian community
 isliye us mulk ke saath rishte behatar kii bharat sarkaar kii dilchaspee swaabhaavik he
 Ever since PM Modi came to power, the Middle East has been prominent in his foreign tours
 modi yuai ke saath sainya sambandh banane ko lekar bhi dilchaspee dikhaate rahe hai
 Both countries will cooperate with each other on the issue of war and security from terrorism
 piem modi ne apane do saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan saudi arab, yuai, katar, iran or anya padosi mulkon kii yatraaen kii
 It is clear that India's attitude towards the Arab world is changing
 pichley saal jab piem modi yuai ke daure par gaye to shaikh mohammad bin jaayad al nahyaan ke saath sanyukt ghoshnaptr main bharat ke liye badi kootnithik jeet kii jhalak dikhi
 This was a major change as 34 years later one of India's pms went to the UAE
 bharat main aarthik sudhaar ke maujuuda daur ko dekhte hue yah yuai ke liye puunji nivesh kaa ek aakarshak or surakshit sthaan ban saktaa he
 At the same time, India wants it to work in the field of science and technology with the UAE
 modi ke piem banane ke baad pehle republic de par america raashtrapati baraak obama or agle saal france ke raashtrapati francwa oland bharat sarkaar ke sarkari mehmaan bane
 Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has once again made it clear that there is no place in the Grand Alliance for Nitish Kumar

 He said, 'I believe that when there is turmoil in the world, do not do this
 
 It has been speculated for a long time, it has to happen sometime, everyone knows this but in this regard, action should be taken in time
 ’ In separate talks with Bloomberg TV, Rajan said the central bank had reached an agreement with the government on the new monetary policy committee
 unhone kaha ki samiti prastaavit masaude se alag hogi jisamen sarkaar ko bahusankhyak sadasyon ko niyukt karnaa tha
 However, he did not elaborate on this
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that a dispute arose over the suggestion made in the draft proposal of the government
 iske tahat rigerv bank ke governor kii adhyakshata vaali samiti main bahusankhyak sadasyon kii niyukti sarkaar karti
 At the same time, there was an emphasis on withdrawal of the earlier proposal to give veto power to the chairman
 haalanki, baad main rajan ne kaha ki unhen vito shakti ko hataae jane ke vichaar se koi pareshaani nahin he
 Presently, the Reserve Bank Governor has a technical advisory committee which advises on monetary policy, but he has the right to accept or reject the committee's views
 rigerv bank ke governor ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat kii arthvyavastha main ashavad kaa maahaul he or chini samasya se sabase kam prabhavit deshon main se ek hoga
 In a conversation with CNBC during the Jackson Hole Summit, Rajan said, "we have not said that our work (on policy rate reduction) is complete
" ham aankadon ke aadhaar par aage nirnay karenge
 "rajan said," There is inflation in our economy which is not there in other economies
 hamane is saal ab tak teen baar dar main katautee kii he or abhi bhi ham taal mail bithaane ke charan main he
 We will keep an eye on the data coming and decide accordingly

 china ke mudde par rajan ne kaha, bharat bada vyapaarik bhagidaar rahaa he, lekin phir bhi china kii arthvyavastha main susti kaa asar itnaa zyada nahin hoga jitna ki anya deshon kaa hoga
 Raghuram Rajan warned the US Federal Reserve Bank to hike interest rates at a time when the global economy is in turmoil
 unhone kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki jab duniya main uthal-puthal he, aap aisa mat kiijie
 
 is bare main lambey samay se anumaan jataayaa ja rahaa he, yah kabhi-na-kabhi hona he, har koi yah jaanata he lekin is sambandh main samay ke hisaab se kadam uthaaya jaae

 He said the committee would differ from the proposed draft in which the government was to appoint a majority of members
 haalanki, unhone is bare main vistaar se kuch nahin bataaya
 The comments ullekhneey he ki sarkaar ke masauda prastaav main die gaye suzav ko lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha
 Under this, the government would appoint majority members in a committee headed by the Governor of the Reserve Bank
 saath hi chairman ke paas vito shakti dene ke purv prastaav ko bhi waapas lene par jor diya gaya tha
 However, Rajan later said that he had no problem with the idea of removing the veto power
 philhal rigerv bank governor ke paas takneekee paraamarsh samiti he jo maudrik niti par paraamarsh detii he, lekin unke paas samiti kii baton ko sweekaar karne yaa use khaarij karne kaa adhikaar he
 The Reserve Bank Governor also said that there is an atmosphere of optimism in India's economy and China will be one of the least affected countries

 Amid the Lok Sabha elections, Akhilesh Yadav has said that the Congress is guilty for not forming an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi
 unhone ravivaar ko kaha ki puraane anubhav bataate hai ki congress ne hi arvind kejariwal ko dhokhaa diya hoga
 Akhilesh Yadav said these things in a super exclusive interview with Aaj Tak
 is sawaal par ki sapa ne uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha, jo baad main tut gaya
 Similarly, for the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress could not be aligned with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, both parties have been telling each other the responsibility for this? What would you say on this because you have previous experiences with Congress? is sawaal par akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki isamen arvind kejariwal kii galati nahin hogi
 It will be the fault of the Congress, the Congress must have cheated
 unhone kaha ki puraane netaa bataate hai ki congress isi tarah kaam karti he, un par bharosa karnaa mumkin nahin he
 Akhilesh Yadav pointed to the Congress and said that he had aligned with me twice
 lekin iske baavjood unhone gathbandhan todaa tha
 So i think Arvind Kejriwal might have shown flexibility, i think the Congress would have cheated
 isse pehle, akhilesh yadav se sawaal kiya gaya ki aapane jitna bada dil basapa ke liye dikhaaya vah congress ke liye nahin dikhaa paae
 The language that is lacking in Indian politics is not seen in the language of Akhilesh Yadav
 aapane kaha ki chywala kaisaa chywala he jo jehar mila rahaa he
 Doing magic on people
 aapse kabhi aisi bhashaa kii ummid nahin thi
 Responding to this, Akhilesh Yadav said that the question is that the Congress had a big heart too, had fought more than 100 seats together

 jab tak aap apane bhaashan main or chaay kaise acchhee hogi jab doodh acha nahin hoga
 On how the idea for alliance with BSP came up, Akhilesh Yadav said that when we won Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections, it was felt that both of us (BSP-SP) will form more alliance in UP and win more seats
 desh ko bachaane kii koshish karenge

 Asaram Bapu was coming to Chhindwara after six years
 chhindwara main hi baba kaa gurukul he
 In which about eight hundred girls study
 is gurukul main lagbhag 70 ladkiyaan barahavin kaa imtehaan dene kii taiyaari kar rahi thim
 While about the same number of girls were about to reach from XI to XII
 gyaravahin se 12veen main ja rahi unheen ladakipoon main se ek wo thi
 He, whom Baba had set eyes on for many months
 darasal us ladki par pehali baar baba kii nazar 2012 main uttarakhand main padi thi
 Baba's intention deteriorated upon seeing him
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo ladki baba ke hi chhindwara gurukul main padhati he
 Even before reaching Chhindwara, Baba sent his special serviceman Shilpi as warden of Gurukul and sent to Chhindwara
 or iske saath hi shuru hui havas bhari sajeesh kii wo kahani jiskaa clymex swatantraaa diwas yani 15 agast ko saamne aayaa
 Shilpi started misleading the girl as soon as she reached Chhindwara Gurukul on the orders of Kahani Baba which started from Chhindwara Gurukul
 wo use kisi tarah baba ke paas jane ko taiyaar karne kii koshishon main jute gai
 The effort was on
 par ladki taiyaar nahin thi
 Actually, the girl had realized Asaram's intention during her first meeting with Baba in Uttarakhand
 par usne ye baat tab kisi ko bataai nahin thi
 The girl's brother was also studying in Chhindwara Gurukul itself
 use laga ki gharavaalon ko bataane se donon bhai-bahan kii padhai kharaab ho jaaegi
 Time went on shilpi ladki ko manaati rahi
 But it did not work
 janvari se jari koshish july aate-aate bhi naakaam ho rahi thi
 Now the month of August had arrived
 baba ke sabar kaa baandh tut rahaa tha
 It was difficult to wait any longer
 shilpi par dabaav lagaataar bad rahaa tha
 The increasing pressure forced Shilpi to make another move
 usne ab ladki ko ye yakeen dilaanaa shuru kar diya ki usapar bhootpret kaa saaya he
 She started telling him how his mind does not feel in any work
 kyon wo dhai-dhai ghante bathroom main rahati he?bhootpret kaa saaya dur karne ke naam par ladki ko jodhpur bulaayadhire-dhire ladki ke dimag main bhootpret kii baat daal kar shilpi ne asli jaal phenkaa
 He told the girl that if she once surrendered herself to Baba, then all the sickness would be removed
 par baba kii niyat se waakif ladki ab bhi taiyaar nahin thi
 Then Shilpi played the last wager
 usne shahjahanpur main ladki ke maa-baap se sampark kiya
 He told them that Shilpi is possessed by ghosts
 ek baar baba ko dikhaa den to thik ho sakati he
 After listening to Shilpi, the girl's father was not ready, but the mother definitely agreed
 shilpi ne ladki ke maa-baap ko ye bhi kaha ki baba ke paas ilaaj ke liye wo donon bhi saath ja sakate hai
 Hearing this, the family agreed
 ghar waalon ke maan jane ke baad ab ladki bhi majabuuran baba se ilaaj karaane ko taiyaar ho chuki thi
 Shilpi immediately gave this news to Asaram over the phone
 asaram kaa phone hameshaa unka nijee sevadara shiva uthaata he
 He puts the same phone on Baba's ear
 khabar milte hi ladki ko baba ke paas bhejne kii taiyaari shuru ho gai
 Shiva was given the responsibility to have Baba's discourse in Jodhpur
 taaki usee pravachan ke dauraan ladki ko jodhpur bulaayaa ja sake
 The responsibility of Shilpi was to bring the girl from Chhindwara to Jodhpur
 or sharat chand ko kaam diya gaya shilpi or ladki ke jodhpur tak bhejne ke intjaam karne kaa
 After this, Shiva fixed the date of Baba's discourse in Jodhpur on 9, 10 and 11 August
 pravachan kii taarikh tay hote hi ladki ke ghar waalon ko khabar de di gai
 Asaram's obscene companies in the conspiracy all happened around August 5
 ab iske baad paanch agast se lekar agle 15 agast tak asaram, shiva, shilpi or sharat chand ke bich har rose lagbhag tees-tees baar phone par baatcheet ho rahi thi
 Before August 5 or after August 15, the four never spoke so often
 sari taiyaari puri hote hi asaram jodhpur pahunch gaye
 He completed a three-day lecture
 phir 13 agast ko wo jodhpur se 40 kilometre dur madi gaanv main devda farm house pahunche
 Which they call the hut of solitude
 is bich ladki ke maa-baap bhi jodhpur aa chuke the
 He was then kept in Baba's Pal Ashram in Jodhpur
 udhar 13 agast ko hi shilpi ke saath ladki chhindwara se jodhpur pahunchati he
 At the railway station, Shiva himself comes to receive both Asaram's personal servants
 13 agast kii raat ladki apane maa-baap ke saath hi paal ashram main bitaati he
 After this, on the morning of August 14, Siva reaches the farmhouse, which is Asaram's confinement, with the girl and her parents
 farm house main baba kaa nijee rasoiyaa prakaash ladki ke liye khaanaa banaata he
 Gives him milk
 phir shaam ko pehali baar baba ladki ke saamne aate hai
 The parents were together
 kuch or bhi log the
 Baba preaches to them
 aashirwad dete hai
 It is then decided that Asaram will treat the girl on August 15
 15 agast ko ladki dopaher ke vakt baba ke saamne hajir kii jaati he
 The parents were still with the girl
 kuch der baba ladki ke maa-baap se baat karte hai
 Then he orders that he will treat the girl in the room alone
 kyonki ilaaj ke liye ekant jaruri he
 On hearing Baba's orders, the girl's parents are removed from the room
 shiva ladki ko baba ke paas puhancha kar pehle hi ja chukaa tha
 Now just near the room was Baba's cook Prakash
 ladki kamare ke andar jaati he or darwaja band ho jaataa he
 Asaram threatened to protest against the obscene act: Asaram Bapu, the girl who had been behind him for months, was now in his confinement with him, 40 km from Jodhpur
 cameraa band tha or kamare ke baahar maujuud tha baba kaa khansama prakaash
 While in the hut, the girl's parents were at some distance
 shiva or shilpi ladki ko baba tak pahunchaa kar vahaan se ja chuke the
 Now there was just Asaram and the girl in the closed room
 ladki ko baba ne pehle sammohit kiya or phir maheenon puraani havas puri kerani shuru kar di
 But perhaps Baba's hypnosis did not affect the girl
 lihaaza wo baba kii ashleel harakat kaa virodh karne lagi
 Then Baba threatened him
 dhamkee ki agar usne jubaan kholi to chhindwara gurukul main pard rahe uske bai or maa-baap ko jaan se maar diya jayega
 Fearing the threat, the girl became silent
 phir dedh ghante baad band cameraa kaa darwaja khulaa
 The girl quietly came out of the secluded hut with her parents and reached Jodhpur in the evening and then left for Shahjahanpur that evening
 udhi baba bhi 16 kii subah ekantavaas se baahar aae or jodhpur ke raste dilli nikal gaye
 Where he had a lecture from 19 August
 is bich shahjahanpur pahunch kar ladki main himmat ai or usne apni maa ko sari baat bataa di
 The mother told the father and then the whole family reached Delhi on 19th
 baba se milane or baba se poochne
 But Baba refused to meet
 lihaaza 20 agast ko ladki ne dilli ke kamala market thane main baba ke khilaaf report likhaa di
 And thus Operation 15 came out to everyone

 maal evam seva kar (GST) ke tahat tex slab kam karne ko lekar lambey samay se charchaa chal rahi he
 Regarding this, the country's Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said that it is not possible to keep a single tax slab in the country
 haalanki slabs ko kam karne kii jarurat he or inhen chaar kii bajaay 3 kiya ja saktaa he
 Arvind Subramanian said that continuous work will be done to improve the GST
 abhi bhi jiesti ko saral banane kii jarurat he or isaki nitiyon ko bhi aasaan bananaa hoga
 Speaking at a program of the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), he said, "in India, we can never keep a rate
" maine ek saamaanya rate or doosraa dimerit guds (aise utpaada jinka seven behatar nahin mana jaataa) ke liye rate tay karne kaa suzav diya tha
 i think that there should not be a debate in India on one rate, rather it should be a debate on why we cannot keep three slabs
 ''maujuuda samay mengsti ke tahat chaar tex slabahai
 Of this, one is 5 percent, the other 12 percent, the third 18 percent and the fourth is 28 percent
 lagjri or dimerit guds jaise tambaakoo or gutke par sabase zyada tex rate lagata he
 Apart from this, cess is also imposed on them
 bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne jiesti ke tahat sirf ek tex slab rakhane kii maang uthaai thi
 However, from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this suggestion was rejected outright
 unhone kaha tha ki aisa sambhav nahin he
 Subramanian also reiterated that GST is a regressive tax policy
 isliye yah nyaaysangat nahin hoga ki ek hi rate rakhaa jaae
 a rate is possible only when adequate arrangements are made for the protection of the poor

 In the series against Australia, none of Team India's players have been behind in adopting an aggressive style on the field
 khilaadiyon ke bich maidan par is tarah kii nokajhonk koi nai baat nahin he, par sawaal yah he ki aakhir isse phayda kise ho rahaa he
 The question is also whether this is the only way to play aggressive cricket, because at the moment, this style of Team India is seen as a loss and Australia will benefit
 purv captain sunil gavaskar apane jamaane ke sabase aakraamak khilaadiyon main se ek the, magar bharat ke is ravaiye kaa vah bhi samarthan nahin karte
 Gavaskar says, "when we start playing cricket, we don't do sledging, whereas Australia do it since childhood, so if you say something to them on the field, they don't mind
" agar aap maidan par duusare khilaadi ko kuch bolte hai or phir aapkaa pradarshan thik nahin rahata, to aap par dabaav ban jaataa he
 At the moment, this style of the team is benefiting Australia
 siries ke donon test match australia jeet chukaa he, lekin abhi tak unke khilaadiyon kii ore se kisi kharaab yaa phir jarurat se zyada aakraamak vyavhaar nahin dekha gaya
 Perhaps the death of his partner Phil Hughes has changed the whole of Australian cricket
 aisa nahin ki in khilaadiyon se pehle team india kii ore se koi aakraamak cricket nahin khelaa gaya
 Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Virender Sehwag responded to opposing teams at every opportunity throughout their careers, but they preferred to talk to their game more than their mouths and that is the best way
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki in khilaadiyon ko unke khel or unke vyavhaar ke bare main samajhane vaala koi nahin
 The captain of the team seems to be uprooted from the team at the moment, and only then he probably says 'unrest' in the dressing room
 har koi jaanata he ki viraat kohli bharat kaa bhavishya hai, magar dukh kii baat yah he ki khilaadi maidan par unke pradarshan se zyada unke tevar apana rahe hai
 In the 2013 assembly elections held in Delhi, there were 13 seats where the victory and defeat were decided by less than 2,000 votes
 inamen se paanch siton par jeet kaa antar 1,000 vot se bhi kam rahaa, or sabase dilachasp tathy yah he ki inamen se teen siton par to antar 500 se bhi kam kaa tha
 This time too, there is a thorn in all these seats
 pichhali baar jeet kaa sabase kam antar aarake puram seat par rahaa tha, jahaan mahaj 326 voton se aam aadmi party jeet darj nahin kar pai thi or baaji bijepi ne maar lee thi, or vijeta anil sharma is baar bhi maidan main hai
 On Delhi Cantt seat too, Surendra Singh of Aam Aadmi Party defeated Karan Singh Tanwar of BJP by just 355 votes, but BJP has not cut his ticket
 vikaspuri main bijepi ke krishna gahalot mahaj 405 voton se haare the or aam aadmi party ke mahendra yadav ne seat apane naam kar lee thi
 Despite losing by such a small margin, BJP has not played a bet on Krishna Gehlot this time
 pichhali baar sangam vihaar seat bhi aam aadmi party ke khate main gai thi or yahaan bhi jeet kaa faasla mahaj 777 voton kaa tha, lekin essiel gupta kaa tikat bijepi ne nahin kaata he
 Apart from this, Somdutt of Aam Aadmi Party defeated bjp's Jayaprakash by 796 votes on Sadar Bazar seat, whose ticket has been cut by the party
 madipur se 'aap' ke vidhayak rahe girish soni or bijepi ke ummidavaar kailash saankala ke bich voton kaa faasla 1,103 vot kaa tha, or saankala par party ne gaaj gira di
 The Sultanpur Majra seat went to the Congress account, and Jaikishan defeated Aam Aadmi Party's Sandeep Kumar by 1,112 votes, but Sandeep is also in the race this time
 aisi dilachasp jeet or haar vaali siton main jangpura, karol baag, rajendra nagar, rohinee, mustafabad or gokulpur bhi shaamil hai, jahaan antar kramash: 1,744, 1,750, 1,796, 1,872, 1,896 or 1,922 voton kaa rahaa
 MS Dhir of AAP, who was the winner in Jangpura, is on the BJP ticket this time
 karol baag main bijepi ne haare hue surendra paal ratawal kaa tikat kaat diya he
 bjp's RP Singh won the Rajendra Nagar seat, and the party has fielded him this time too
 rohinee seat pichhali baar 'aap' ke khate main gai thi, or haare hue bijepi ke ummidavaar jayabhagwan agarwal kaa tikat kaat diya gaya he, lekin sabase dilachasp pahalu yah he ki pichhali baar nai dilli seat se arvind kejariwal ke mukaable 28,000 se bhi zyaada voton se harkar tisare number par rahe purv pradeshdhyaksh vijendra gupta par party ne rohinee main daanv khelaa he
 Mustafabad seat In the last election, Congress's Hassan Ahmed defeated Jagdish Pradhan of BJP, but this time both of them are in the fray
 gokulpur seat pichhali baar bijepi ke khate main gai thi, so, is baar bhi ummidavaar ranjit singh barkaraar hai
 Another interesting information is that in the last time, out of these 13 seats, there was a direct contest between the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP, out of which AAP was successful on seven
 do siton par 'aap' kaa muqabla congress se tha, or donon ke khate main ek-ek seat ai thi
 In the remaining two seats, the contest was between the BJP and the Congress, and here too, each seat was named by both parties

 Not because it is a World Cup final, but because both the teams are in excellent form and the captaincy of both the teams has also been excellent

 Defeating New Zealand will not be easy for Australia
 bharat ke log do vajah se newzealand ko namaste karte hue nazar aaenge, meraa matlab newzealand kii jai-jayakaar karte hue najar aaenge
 The first reason is that New Zealand have a chance to reach the final for the first time and take advantage of it to win the New Zealand World Cup
 duusari vajah he australian khilaadiyon ke sledging se cricket premi pareshaan hai
 In the last few days, Australian players have considered sledging as their weapon
 aisa lagata he ki match ke dauraan australian khilaadiyon ke liye teen chijen myne rakhti hai, batting, bowling or sledging
 Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja says, "australia's plan is to do tu-tu-main-i inside the ground and after winning the match, will take a glass of beer in hand and reach the opposition team's dressing room to join hands 
 aisa lagata he zakhm par namak chhidakane aae hai
 If Australia's point of view is seen, then playing on home ground will definitely benefit Australia
 newzealand ke liye sabase badi samasya hogi australia ke gharelu darshakon ke saamne pradarshan karnaa jiskaa manovaigyanik dabaav hota he
 But in terms of form, New Zealand is in good form with Australia
 lig match ke dauraan newzealand australia ko haraa bhi chukaa he lekin yah bhi sach he ki newzealand ne yah match apane gharelu maidan oakland main khelaa tha
 In the 2015 World Cup, New Zealand has not played a single match on Australia's ground
 lekin bharat ke darshak melbern ke maidan par newzealand ke saath khadey nazar aaenge
 In this match, like other matches, the toss will matter
 jo bhi team toss jeetegi pehle ballebaaji karegi kyonki is maidan par 2015 ke world cap main abhi tak chaar match ho chuke hai or pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ne har baar match jeeta he or har match main pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ne 300 se zyada ran bhi banaae hai
 Australia is ahead if seen from the point of view of statistics
 is world cap ke dauraan australia ne apana pehla match melbern ke maidan par khelaa tha or pehle batting karte hue 342 ran banaae the or england ko 111 ran se bhi haraaya bhi tha
 New Zealand have not played any matches on Melbourne ground since 2009
 newzealand ne is maidan par apana aakhir match 6 farvari 2009 ko khelaa tha or 6 wicket se australia ko haraaya tha
 Australia has played a total of 118 odis at Melbourne ground and Australia has won 71 matches and the win percentage has been close to 62
 vahiin agar newjiland kii baat karen to newzealand ko kul 24 ekadivasiy maichon main sirf 8 main jeet mili he or jeet kaa pratishat 35 ke kareeb rahaa he
 India has been eliminated from this World Cup
 ab bharat ke log bina dabaav main aae yah match dekhenge
 Now there will be no drama, no drums will be played, players of India will not be pulled on the news channel
 ab vahi hoga jo hona chahie
 The one who wins will be Alexander

 Jaitley said that a group of different agencies formed to investigate cases of Indian names are analyzing every account
 jinke paas avaidh khate hai unki ‘raat kii neend gaayab ho jaaegi’
 Let us tell you that in the published reports based on paper leaks, the names of about 500 Indians who have allegedly invested money in various units in Panama have come up
 inamen kai charchit hastiyaan or udyogpati shaamil hai
 Panama is considered a refuge for tax evaders
 vitt mantri ne di kadi chetavaneeek news channel se baatcheet main jetali ne kaha, 'ab ye panama naam saamne aae hai
 In the last three days we formed a group
 ham prayek khaaton kii jaanch kar rahe hai taaki yah pataa lagaaya ja sake kikun vaid he or koun avaidh
 Giving a stern warning, Jaitley said, "those who have valid accounts need not worry
 lekin jinke avaidh khate hai, unki raat kii neend gaayab ho jaaegi
 Soon after the Panama document revealed that accounts were kept abroad, the government constituted a group of officials from RBI, Income Tax Department, Financial Intelligence Unit and Foreign Tax and Tax Research to ascertain that the accounts were legitimate
 Or illegal
 jetali ne kaha, 'jin logon ne avaidh rup se khate rakhe hai, ham uskaa pataa lagane kii koshish karenge aarai mujhe lagata he ki jaldi hi sabhi chijen saaf ho jaaengi
 "people angry because of my tough attitude" The Finance Minister dismissed the criticism that the BJP government was not fulfilling the pre-election promise about Kaladhan
 unhone kaha, 'jo log mujhase naaraaz hai, uskaa ekmaatr kaaran meraa is maamle main kadaa rukh he
 Jaitley further said that the Congress-led government did nothing about disclosure of accounts in the Lichtenstein list, but the BJP government investigated the case, assessed it and initiated criminal proceedings against all the accused
 'jari he aapraadhik kaarywahi'jetali ne aage kaha, 'kar ekatrit kiye ja rahe hai or aapraadhik kaarywahi jari he
 He said that 500-525 people out of 628 names were traced in HSBC accounts and assessment orders have been issued
 unhone kaha ki kareeb 150 logon ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 Regarding domestic black money, Jaitley said that people are protesting because they 2

 Due to this black money is decreasing
 indian badminton lig (ibiel) ke nai scoring pranali ne chah frenchiji tiimon ke kochon ke bich halchal machaa di he jinhone ise ‘dilachasp’ or ‘chunauteepurn’ qaraar kiya he
 The six franchise teams discussed in the meeting and formulated a strategy for the players' auction, when they were informed of the new scoring system that would be used during the initial league's 90 matches
 nai scoring pranali ke anusaar pehle do game main prayek main saat or 14 ank par 60 second ke do brake honge or agar yah match nirnaayak game main pahunchataa he to yah brake chathe ank ke baad hoga
 Also the first two games will be 21 points without a standard two point difference and the player who reaches the first 11 points in the decider game will be the winner of the match
 purv bhartiya coach vimal kumaar ibiel main ‘banga beats’ kaa maargdarshan kar rahe hai
 He said, 'this is the new scoring system
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki khilaadi is nai ank pranali se kaise nipatate hai
 This will make the match more competitive
 is nai pranali se khilaadi oonchi ranking ke khilaadi ko haraane kii bhi ummid kar sakate hai
 The legendary Malaysian coach Rashid Sedek, who trained world number one Lee Chong Wei, however, said that the new scoring system would help aggressive players
 unhone kaha, ‘isse un khilaadiyon ko madad milegi, jinka game aakraamak he
 Brakes can spoil the rhythm of the players but still it will be difficult to defeat a player like Lee Chong Wei
 ’ anya standard scoring pranali ke niyam vahiin rahenge jaise donon pakshon ko pehle or duusare tathaa duusare or tisare game ke bich main do do minute kaa brake milegaa jabaki nirnaayak ke chathe ank par khilaadi apane sarvice court badalenge
 The format of the matches has also been changed slightly as it will feature five games in two men's singles, one women's singles, one men's and mixed doubles
 bharat ke rashtriya coach pulela gopichand ibiel kii sanchaalan parishad ke ek sadsy hai
 He said that the new scoring system has been adopted to shorten the match so that the five matches are finished within three hours

 elahabaad main aasthaa kaa mahakumbh ke aagaaj ho gaya he
 On the first day of this mahaparva, which lasts for 55 days, on the day of Makar Sankranti, there is a surge of devotees on the Sangam coast
 log sangam main pavitra dubkee laga rahe hai
 Mahanirvani Akhara did its first royal bath, the first royal bath was by Mahanirvani Akhara

 In Madhya Pradesh, farmers started a strike demanding a minimum support price increase
 kisaanon ke is virodh ne dhire-dhire hinsak rup le liya
 The result of which was that 6 farmers were killed in police firing
 jabaki kai gambhir rup se ghayal ho gayi
 On this day, two farmers committed suicide in Nashik
 madhyapradesh ke alaava maharashtra, rajasthan or gujarat main bhi kisaanon apni maangon ko lekar sarkaar ke saamne aa gayi hai
 Farmers are protesting in four states with BJP government claiming to double farmers' income
 ab sawaal ye uthne lage hai ki bijepi kii sarkaar vaale rajyon main hi kisaan kyon andolan kar rahe hai? saath hi ye bhi ki kya upi main kisaanon keekarjamafika piem modi kaa elaan bijepi ke liye mishan 2019 main chunauti ban saktaa he?chaaron rajyon main kisaanon ke virodh ke peeche darasal upi kii yogi sarkaar ke us faisle ko mana ja rahaa he, jisamen kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 During the election campaign, PM Modi promised to waive off the debt of farmers in the first cabinet when the BJP government was formed in the state
 vaade ke mutabikmukhyamantri yogi adityanathane apni pehali cabinet meeting main hi kisaanon kaa 36 hajaar karod se zyada kaa bakaayaa karj maaf kar diya
 After this decision of the Yogi government, a hope was also raised among the farmers of other states
 ye ummid ab jid tak aag pahunchi he
 The farmers of Maharashtra sent a proposal for their demands to the Fadnavis government
 kisaan sanghathanon kii unke saath baithak bhi hui, lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 After which the farmers started the movement
 badi sankhya main kisaan sadakon par utar aaye
 In protest, he poured milk on the streets, planted vegetables on the highway
 maharashtra main karj maafee ke alaava kisaanon kii kuch or bhi maange hai
 - Implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission - Government should give loans for agriculture without interest - Farmers under 60 years of age should be given pension - Get 50 rupees per liter for milk
 The impact of the decision of the UP government to see only in Madhya Pradesh or Maharashtra did not get
 balki gujarat or rajasthan main bhi iskaa prabhaav najar aa rahaa he
 In Banaskantha, Gujarat, farmers have expressed strong opposition to the price of potatoes and lack of water for farming
 kisaanon ne sadakon par aalu phenk kar pradarshan kiya
 At the same time, in Pratapgarh, Rajasthan, bordering Madhya Pradesh, farmers are raising their voice
 kisaan apni upaj kaa samarthan mulya badhaane sahit das sutreey maangon ko lekar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Here too farmers protested by throwing milk and vegetables
 kisaanon kii maang he ki upaj kaa samarthan mulya laagat se zyada ho, beemaa companiyaan samay par clem paas karen or atake hue muaavje jald milen
 The farmers are warning that the agitation will be fierce if the demands are not met by the 10th
 haalanki, sirf ye chaar rajya hi nahin hai, jahaan kisaan pareshaan he, karj ke boj main dabaa hua he
 Recently farmers in Tamil Nadu even staged a naked demonstration in front of Parliament in Delhi
 kisaan kii behaali kaa andaja un par karj ke aankadon se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 At present, there is a loan of 12 lakh 60 thousand crores on farmers across the country
 NCRB kaa akada kahata he ki 2001-15 tak 15 saalon main desh ke 2 lakh 34 hajaar 642 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Somewhere the farmer has been drowned in debt due to drought, then despite good yields after good monsoon, his good days are not seen
 aise main maharashtra, madhya pradesh, rajasthan or gujarat sarkaar ko bhi kisaanon kaa gussa shant karne ke liye yogi sarkaar jaise kadam uthaane par vichaar karnaa hoga
 If this does not happen, the resentment of farmers may come as a big challenge for the party in bjp's Mission 2019

 " After the Punjab National Bank (PNB) Mahaghotale surfaced, the central government is now considering a new way of monitoring in banks and its regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
 donon jagahon par nigaraanee kaa maujuuda system fail hone par hi PNB jaisaa mahaghotaalaa itnaa zyada fail gaya
 The reason for the central government's concern is that RBI also does not have arrangements to stop such fraud in banks
 yaa phir is maamle main in praavdhaanon kaa uchit tareeke se istemaal hi nahin kiya gaya
 It is also being reviewed whether the RBI missed its responsibility
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki RBI kii jimmedaari keval bainkon main enpie ghoshit karne ke baad puri nahin ho jaati
 According to sources, the government is worried after this development
 shanivaar ko chif iconomic adwiser arvind subramanyam ne RBI se behatar dhang se nigaraanee karne kii maang kii thi
 He had raised questions about what the regulator or supervisor i
e
 RBI was doing during the scam! He had said that apart from the internal system of auditing, there should also be an external system
 haalanki, ek din pehle RBI ne is ghotaale ko ek yaa zyada bank karmchaariyon ke galat kaam kaa nateeja or aantarik vyavastha kaa maamla bataaya tha
 Explain that at present, RBI does not investigate branches of banks
 yah pehle bhi kai baar sarkaar ko likh chukaa he ki yah saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ke board main shaamil nahin hona chahta he
 RBI has said that it is the regulator of these banks and if it is involved in their decisions then it will be a conflict of interest
 centre sarkaar ke bhrashtachar mukt shashan ke vaade ko neerav modi or mehul chokasee ke kiye ghotaale se jhatka laga he
 Central government sources say that there is a need to review the existing system to ensure that Mahaghotala like PNB is not happening elsewhere in the banking sector
 adhikari kaa kahana he ki bainkon main aantarik nigaraanee ke liye kai tareeke hote hai
 This has clearly failed in the PNB case
 PNB ke maamle main kai staron par nigaraanee vyavastha fail hui he
 The government official says that action should be taken against the surveillance officer who failed to stop the PNB scam
 unhone kaha he ki agar bank ke adhikariyon ne auditors kii chetavanee ko nazarandaaj kiya to unpar aapraadhik karrwai honi chahie
 Let me tell you that the auditor of Nirav Modi's flagship firm Firestar International Limited, Daylight Haskins & Sales LLP, drew attention to this two years ago
 tab isane neerav kii form kii kamjor aantarik vyavastha par chintaa jaahir kii thi
 According to the report of Indian Express, the government is considering that the ownership model of public sector banks should be changed to fix responsibility in such scams
