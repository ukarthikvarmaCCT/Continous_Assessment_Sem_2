 Priyanka said, 'I will work to strengthen the organization
 ' isse saaf jaahir he ki wo philhal party sanghathan ko majboot karne kaa kaam karengi
 Earlier, in a meeting with Lucknow workers, Priyanka had requested her to contest from Lucknow to which she did not respond and laughed
 haalanki yah baat unhone lakhanu sansadeey kshetra ke liye banaai gai donon tiimon se kahi
 Actually, the workers had appealed to him to contest from Lucknow
 is par priyanka ne poocha ki aap main se koun chunaav ladanaa chahta he
 Interestingly, activists have also asked not to give tickets to any celebrity or outsider from Lucknow
 lakhanu kii tarah hi phulpur loksabhaa seat ke kaaryakartaaon se bhi priyanka rubaru huin
 During this, activists requested Priyanka to contest the next Lok Sabha election from Phulpur, which has been rejected by Priyanka Gandhi
 darasal, phulpur loksabhaa seat congress kii paramparaagat seat rahi he
 From here, the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru used to contest elections
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko saunpi he
 Out of 80 Lok Sabha seats of the state, Priyanka has been given the command of 41 seats, while the charge of 39 seats is on the shoulders of Scindia

 It ended at 15
 is dauraan na to unhone lunch kiya or nahi dinar kiya
 After a marathon meeting with party workers of about 16 hours, he tried to understand the political pulse of the state

 To understand the situation and not just criticize
 aap sari jimmedaari nyaaypalika par nahin daal sakate
 2 crore judicial cases are dealt with every year, Justice Thakur said that people feel that only the judiciary is responsible for the large number of pending cases but the reality is that we deal with 2 crore cases every year
 wo bhi tab jabaki hai corts main jajon kii maujuuda sankhya tay sankhya se 50 fisadi kam he
 There are 10 judges in the country per million people whereas it should be at least 50
 apni baat samajhane ke liye mukhya nyaayadhish ne 5veen class main maths ke ek sawaal kaa udhaaharan bhi diya ki ek kaam ko 10 aadmi mil kar kitne din main karenge or vahi kaam 50 aadmi kitne din main karenge
 Population increased but not the ratio of judges Sudharajstis Thakur said that the proportion of people and judges in India is much lower than in America, Australia, Britain and Canada
 saal 1987 main ai lau kamishan kii report ke mutabik 40 hajaar jajon kii jarurat thi

 At that time, there were 100 cases pending per judge
 1960 main jajon kii sankhya 14 ho gai or lambit maamle badhkar 3247 ho gaye
 In 1977 the number of judges increased to 18 and the number of cases to 14501
 saal 2009 aate-aate supreme court main jajon kii sankhya 31 hui or lambit maamle 77181 ho gaye
 He said that in the year 2014 the number of cases was 81582 which was reduced to 60260

 Investors also see judicial potential of the countryjustice Thakur said that we have become one of the fastest emerging economies in the world
 ham mek in india or epadiai kii baat karte hai lekin hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki jinhen ham aamantrit kar rahe hai ve bhi is prakaar ke niveshon se paidaa hone vaale maamalon or vivaadon se nipatane main desh kii nyaayik vyavastha kii kshamta ke bare main chintit hai
 We should not forget that the development of the country is linked to the capacity of the judiciary
 pradhanmantri modi ne madad kaa bharosa diyakanoon mantralay kii taraf se jari kiye gaye kaarykram ke mutabikpradhanmantri narendra modiko kaarykram main nahin bolnaa tha lekin mukhya nyaayadhish kii is bhavuk apil ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne bhi samaaroh ko sambodhit kiya
 PM Modi said that people have faith in the judiciary
 mukhya nyaayadhish ne behad ahm baat rakhi he, usko sirf sun kar chalaa jaaun main aisa insaan nahin hum
 If there is no problem of constitutional boundaries, then the CJI team and the heads of the government sit together to find a solution
 der aayad durust aepradhanmantri ne kaha ki yah tay karnaa sabhi kii jimmedaari he ki aam aadmi kaa nyaaypalika main bharosa bana rahe or unki sarkaar jimmedaari ko puraa karegi
 On the kcji's statement that there has been a continuous delay in recruitment of judges, the Prime Minister said, "wake up then dawn
" unhone kaha ki main unke dard ko samaj saktaa hum kyonki 1987 ke baad se kaaphi samay biit chukaa he
 Whatever the compulsions were, but late Ayad came better
 ham bhavishya main behatar karenge
 Let us see how we can move forward by reducing the burden of yesterday

 The CJI resumed session and the joint conference were overcrowded before the media and Tosiji TS Thakur, Law Minister Sadanand Gowda, Justice Anil Dave and Justice JS Khehar met the media
 saamne aae sawaalon par ek baar phir sijeai bhavuk ho gaye
 Speaking on the suggestion given by Prime Minister Modi to reduce the leave to the judges, Justice Thakur said that in the last 4 months, 17 thousand cases have been settled by the courts
 3 karod cese lambit hai
 How many cases will be settled after sitting for a few hours more
 3 hafte kam chuttee lekar ham kya karen? kya vakil chuttee chhodkar kaam karenge? chuttee main ham manali jaakar trekking nahi karte, tab bhi kaam karte hai, faisle likhte hai
 One can understand the difficulty of a judge who has either worked as a judge or has a wife or child of a judge
 lau kamishan kii siforeeshon ke 30 saal baad bhi aadhe kam jazunhone kaha ki aap sirf ye kehete raho ki kaam khatm karo
 How to finish We have 81 cases a day

 i spent 45 years of my life, 22 years as a lawyer and 23 years as a judge
 ek kism keekamitment to he, koshish to he ki kuch kar paaen
 30 years ago today, the Government's own Law Commission told that there should be 40 thousand judges in the country
 30 saal baad bhi kya hai 40 hajaar jaj? aaj bhi hamaare paas 18-19 hajaar jaj hi hai
 So, where 40 thousand laborers are needed to finish a project, if you have 20 people working there, then obviously the work cannot be completed
 ye kaam kisi jaadu kii chadi se to hoga nahin
 There will be people only
 ham to baar baar kah rahe hai
 Your law commission is saying
 supreme court ne order kiya he ki sankhya badhaaie
 The Prime Minister said that we will increase, but what to do if we do not increase

 In response to a question on Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde's statement on the coal issue, Karat said, "in 2014, Shinde will understand how weak people's memory is
" ’ shinde ne kaha tha ki koyala mudde ko log jaldi hi bhul jaaenge
 Karat said, "he said that there was no loss in the spectrum, now he is saying that nothing went wrong in the allocation of coal
 ’karaat ne kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata he ki log ise bhul jaaenge
 'although Shinde said in his defense,' i said in a funny tone
 media ne mere bayaan ko prasang se baahar jaakar pesh kiya he
 'significantly, Shinde had said that people will soon forget the coal issue like Bofors
 bhaajapa netaa balbir punj ne kaha, ‘1984 main indira gandhi kii maut ke baad jab chunaav hue to congress ko 400 se zyada siten mili thim
 Five years later, the Congress was ousted from power over Bofors and its seats were halved
 ’punj ne kaha, ‘yah alag maamla he ki log boforce maamle ko bhuule hai yaa nahin lekin congress bhul gai he ki boforce ke baad uske saath kya hua
 After this, Congress did not get majority on its own
 ’bhakpa ke di
 Raja also reminded the ruling party that she had lost the election after Bofors and people gave this message to the then government
 unhone kaha, ‘congress party or scindia ko yah yaad rakhana chahie
 JDU president Sharad Yadav called Shinde his 'old friend' but could not hide his unhappiness
 yadav ne kaha, ‘vah haal main dilli aae hai
 Their importance is due to the Congress party
 behatar he vah keval grih mantralay ke bare main bolen
 He should speak less on political issues
 ’ Just two months before the MCD elections, the delimitation of wards has snatched away the nights and nights of all congress-bjp and Independent councilors
 dlimitesan ke baad dilli ke kai parshadon ke ward hi khatm kar die gaye to kai parshadon ke ward main nae booth jode jane se parshad kanfus hai ki puraane votaron ko sanbhaalein yaa nae jude votaron ko rijhaane ke liye vaade or daawey karen
 Pushp Vihar Ward from Ambednagar Assembly has been abolished and Ambedkarvard has been enlarged in its place
 isse pushp vihaar ke parshad em nagarajan ke saamne mushkil khadi ho gai he
 Because the former mayor Khushiram from Ambedkar Nagar ward can stake claim
 jaahir he aise main nagarajan or khushiram donon main se ek hi ward ke liye ladenge
 At the same time, challenges have arisen in front of Radhe Shyam Sharma, former chairman of southmcd Standing Committee, after the end of Nanakpura ward
 radheshyaam bataate hai ki unhone badi mehnat se apni ward main kaam kiye
 Opened new gyms, brought water for the beauty of the parks, but with the completion of the work, all their work was lost
 inke saamne ab pareshaani ye he ki daavedaari kaise thoken kyonki ward khatm hone se duusare ward main naevotaronko kaise rijhaaen or us ward main pehle se di jame parshad se takaraav hona bhi tay he

 By exposing the 'spot fixing' that took place in IPL-6, the Delhi Police has locked the mouth of all the opponents who were seeking the resignation of the Delhi Police Commissioner till some time back
 ajtak ke kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main dilli ke police kamishnar niraj kumaar ne kaha ki unhone rajasthan royles ke teen bade khilaadiyon- es srisanth, ajit chandila or ankit chavaan par soch-samajhakar or kanoonee daanvpech ko jaanate hue haath daalaa he
 When Neeraj Kumar was asked whether the players had confessed their crime in the inquiry that was going on, Neeraj Kumar said, "we have so much evidence that they have no other way than to confess
" unako jab saboot dikhaae, to wo nakaar nahin paae
 When Neeraj Kumar was asked that the lawyers of Kikratras are saying that the claims of the police are hollow and they have no evidence to prove that Kikratars did spot fixing
 is par niraj kumaar ne kaha, 'har vakil yahi kahata he ki uskaa muvakkil nirdosh he
 But we have proof
 itane bade khilaadiyon par haath soch-samajhakar, kanoonee daanvpech ko jaanate hue rakhaa he
 We will present the evidence before the court and the court will decide whether this evidence is appropriate or not
 'jab police kamishnar se poocha gaya ki aap kaise jaanate hai ki jo colls baahar se ai hai wo anderworld se ain
 They can come from any number in Dubai
 aapako kaise yakeen he ki ye anderworld ke hi log hai
 On this question, Neeraj Kumar said, 'we have many reasons why we can say that they are people of the underworld
 par main ye kaaran bataa nahin saktaa kyonki ye jaruri nahin ki tahakikat kii sari baaten aapako bataai jaaen
 When Neeraj Kumar was asked that some lawyers said that the video clips that the police showed and the transcript they heard should not have been done
 ye to media trial hua
 Should have spoken to the court directly
 is par niraj kumaar ne kaha, 'ye isliye kiya kyonki hamaari baat par koi vishwaas nahin karata
 The second motive was to tell people that whenever they go to watch matches, they go there thinking that everything is fair there but it is not in reality
 jise wo nishpaksh samaj rahe hai wo nishpaksh nahin he
 When Neeraj Kumar was asked that BCCI and IPL have anti-corruption unit, do you think she could not do her job properly, because all the fixing was happening under her nose, but she did not get a little clue
 to is par niraj kumaar ne kaha, 'main is par kuch nahin kahana chaahunga
 i do not want to blur any other unit or institution
 'ek ahm sawaal poocha gaya ki jis tarah se itane saalon se match phixing kaa dhandha chal rahaa he, jise khatm karne main ham naakaamayaab rahe hai, to kya betting ko vaid kar dena chahie
 To this Neeraj Kumar said, 'I am a police officer
 meraa kaam tahakikat karnaa or apni force kii aguwai karnaa he
 i do not think it is right to comment on such things and the government will have to decide whether it wants to legalize betting or not
 par main ise vaid karne ke sakht khilaaf hum
 It has many side effects
 'vaise dilli main aparaadh ke badhate aakadon par bhi niraj kumaar ne apni baat rakhi or kaha, 'aparaadh ke aakadon ko rokna police ke liye sabase aasaan kaam he, kyonki jab aapke paas koi shikaayat darj karwaane aae or aap use daraa den or shikaayat darj naa karen to aankade kam hi honge
 Earlier this used to happen when complaints were not filed, but i am proud that today the complaints of people have become zero that i went to the police station and my case was not registered
 main in aakadon kii parvaah nahin karata jo is tarah shikaayat darj karwaane par krime figars upar dikhaate hai
 The basic reform of the police is that the parameters of the performance of the police should not be these figures, because it is very easy to play with data
 police kii parformens kaa maapdand ye hona chahie ki kitne cese sulajhaa liye gaye hai or kitne log pakade gaye
 ' bharat ne videshi mudra ke bhandar kaa nayaa record bana liya he

 isi hafte bharat kaa swarna bhandar 20

 The major reason for the increase in foreign exchange reserves is that the Reserve Bank is balancing the flow of dollars through public sector banks

 On the Hallabol platform of 'sahitya Aaj Tak-2018', there was an interesting discussion on the topic of where books got lost in the era of internet and computers
 'tej' channel ke senior ekjicutive editor sanjay sinha ne kaha ki jis tarah gramophone gaayab ho gaya or uski jagah sidi or dividi player ne lee, lekin sangeet or gane gaayab nahin hue, isi tarah kitaaben bhale gaayab na ho lekin inhen padhane kaa tarika badal jayega
 'what books have been lost in this era of internet?' The students of Delhi University, who were interested in literature in the name session, unanimously rejected the fact that the Internet can ever finish books
 haalanki yah sabane mana ki yah padhane or likhane kaa tarika jarur badal saktaa he lekin kitabon kii jagah nahin le saktaa
 Prashant Chaudhary, a student of Hansraj College, said that books are not a monolithic culture, when we try to understand, we see that the Internet promotes books somewhere, we know about books through internet and buy 
 isliye ve nahin maanate ki internet kitabon ko khatm kar saktaa he
 Although he admitted that the internet distracts attention somewhere, but some people have limited the internet to social media only because its scope is very large, so it is not appropriate to restrict pornsite to social media
 sahitya kaa rashtradharm: 'aaj ke samay main desh kii sabase badi chintaa he bheedtantr'indraprastha mahila college kii chaatra shravasti haldar ne kaha aaj bhi log kitaaben dilchaspee rakhte hai
 But the Internet is a medium where people can share their work
 unhone kaha ki internet kitabon kii khushboo or uske sparsh kii jagah nahin le saktaa
 At the same time, Utkarsh Chaudhary, a student of Hindu College, said that if i want to print my works as a poet, then the publisher will think ten times whether it will work or not
 lekin vardepress or soshal media community par apni rachanaaen saajha kar sakate or us par pratikriya paa sakate hai

 aspx sabhi ko swasthya beemaa muhaiyaa karaane kii apni kavayad ke tahat sarkaar kii koshish gharelu sahaayakon ko bhi iesaisi ke daayre main laane kii he
 Union Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said on Saturday that a pilot scheme in this regard will soon be launched in Delhi and Hyderabad
 yahaan patrakaron ke saath charchaa main dattatreya ne kaha, desh main pehali baar saamaajik suraksha ke tahat gharelu sahaayakon ko iesaisi ke tahat laayaa jayega
 We will bring two initial projects in this regard to Delhi and Hyderabad

 He said that before finalizing the rules related to this, we will organize a workshop with all stakeholders
 is yojana se deshbhar main kareeb ek karod gharelu sahaayakon ko laabh milegaa
 In response to a question, Dattatreya said that he would also examine the implementation of the Majithia Pay Commission's recommendations for working journalists
 dattatreya ne kaha ki isse pehle vitt mantri arun jetali ke netritv main mantriyon ke samooh main anganwari or aashaa kaaryakartaaon ko bhi iesaisi ke daayre main laane or bhavishya nidhi sevaayen dene ke bare main vichaar kiya gaya he
 The comments mantri ne kaha ki is sambandh main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay, swasthya mantralay, mahila evam bal kalyaan mantralay ke sanyukt sachivon kii sadsyta vaali ek samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 a senior officer of the Ministry of Labor will be the convener of this committee
 yah samiti is sambandh main yojit hone vaali kaaryshaalaaon main bhi bhaag legi
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) In a discussion with journalists here, Dattatreya said, for the first time in the country, domestic assistants will be brought under ESIC under social security
 ham is sambandh main dilli or hyderabad main do shuruaati pariyojnaayen laaenge
 It has two parts, one given by the employee and the other by the employer's contribution
 unhone kaha ki isse jude niyamon ko antim rup dene se pehle ham sabhi hitdharakon ke saath ek kaaryshaala kaa aayojan karenge
 The scheme will benefit about one crore domestic helpers across the country
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main dattatreya ne kaha ki vah shramjivi patrakaron ke liye majithia vetan ayog kii siforeeshon par amal kii bhi jaanch karenge
 Dattatreya said that earlier in the group of ministers under the leadership of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Anganwadi and ASHA workers have also been considered to come under the purview of ESIC and provide provident fund services
 tippaniyan The minister said that in this regard a committee consisting of joint secretaries of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Women and Child Welfare has been formed
 shram mantralay kaa ek varisht adhikari is samiti kaa sanyojak hoga
 This committee will also participate in workshops to be held in this regard
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 ) In the next few years, students of Punjab will be able to hear them talking in Chinese
 punjab sarkaar jaldi hi sthaneey skulon main videshi bhashaaen khaas kar chini bhashaa ke course shuru karne ja rahi he or isaki ghoshnaa punjab ke mukhyamantri ne vidhansabha main karte hue bataaya ki 12veen tak ke chaatr vaikalpik bhashaa ke taur par chini bhashaa padhenge
 In Punjab's government schools, Hindi, Punjabi and English as well as Chinese language will be taught to children
 punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne kaha ki chini bhashaa ke saath anya videshi bhashaaon ke vikalp bhi chaatro ko milenge
 These foreign languages students of Punjab 11th and 12th will be able to read and these will be based on the option
 mukhyamantri captain singh ne kaha ki china kii simaaen kai deshon ke saath lagati hai
 Because of this, the Chinese language is becoming very popular in these areas, as well as Chinese people live in many states of the country
 aise main china bhashaa ko anya bhashaaon ko praathamikta di jaaegi
 On the other hand, AAP Arora, the leader of your party from Punjab, alleged that the government does not have sufficient infrastructure for schools
 sarkaar kai skool ko band kar rahi he or jo anya bhashaaon ke course skulon main chal rahe he, unako padhaane ke liye adhyaaapak to hai nahin lekin videshi bhashaaon ko skulon main lagu karne kii baat kah rahi he
 This is a humorous initiative
 aap netaa ne sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki pahalepunjab sarkaarshiksha niti ke saath-saath chaatraon or shikshakon ko behatar shiksha muhaiyaa karwaae phir uske baad videshi bhashaaon ko lagu kare
 At the same time, on behalf of the Akali Dal, Bikram Singh Majithia also objected to the government's announcement that on one hand, the Punjab government is saying that they do not have money to pay teachers and the lack of infrastructure in schools too is
 aise main chini bhashaa padhaane vaale tutors kaa prabandh kahaan se kiya jayega or unako paisa kahaan se diya jayega
 This in itself shows the dual strategy of the government
 punjab main pehle hi angreji or maatrubhaasha punjabi main sarkari skulon main pard rahe bacchon ke rigelt kii haalat bahut hi kharaab he, aise main sarkaar kii chini bhashaa ko padhaane ke peeche kya ranneeti he or iskaa punjab ke chaatro ko kya phayda milegaa
 Only time will tell
 aamir khan ko logon ne aaj tak kisi aword function main nahin dekha he
 Neither do they ever take the award nor do they perform in any function
 lekin kya aapane kabhi ye sochaa he ki salmaan khan kabhi aword kyon nahin lete
 Salman has been seen many times performing in award shows but does not take the award
 salmaan philhal IIFA awords ke liye neuyork main hai
 IIFA: Salman said - i remember only one date, that is Katrina's b'day there, he told that he only goes to perform on stage
 unhen awords main bilkul yakeen nahin he
 Salman said- i never received any award
 mere khyaal se maine bas ek baar saporting actor kaa aword jeeta tha, jo main kabhi ghar lekar nahin gaya
 i like awards not awards
 bahut pehle ek magazine ke editor ne mujhe aword sho main aane ke liye request kiya
 i was nominated for the film Maine Pyar Kiya
 unka kahana tha ki agar main aauungaa to mujhe aword de diya jayega
 Why did the Bachchan family finally make IIFA Boycott, what is Salman's reason? They further revealed that when they announced the nomination, Jackie Shroff, Salman Khan and someone else were named
 jab maine apana naam suna to uth gaya
 At the same time it was announced that the winner is Jackie Shroff
 us din maine kasam khai ki main kabhi waapas nahin aauungaa
 i never take the award
 bas parform karata hum
 If i get so much money for my poor performance, i am very happy
 salmaan 15 july ko IIFA main parform karenge
 Sources associated with Advantage told NDTV that Sequoia may not have evaluated Vasan's shares for any 'specific reason'
 unhon saath hi bataaya ki ye 'vivaadaaspad vasiyaten' aise logon ne banaae hai, jo ki 'dashakon se karti chidambaram ke kareeb dost' rahe hai or un vasiyaton main likhi baton par kisi tarah kii 'atkal, bahes yaa charchaa' kii gunjaais nahin
 Maharashtra's Devendra Fadnavis government passed the bill from the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, following the announcement of giving 16 per cent reservation to Marathas
 iske baad samaaj ke duusare log bhi aarakshan kii maang karne lage hai
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has raised the issue of Muslim reservation in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki vah shiksha or naukari ke kshetra main muslimon ke aarakshan ke liye court jaaenge
 Owaisi's demand has been supported by bjp's ally Shiv Sena
 bataa den ki shivasena centre or maharashtra main bijepi kii sahyogi party he
 Shiv Sena MLA Sunil Prabhu said that the party will raise its voice to bring justice to the oppressed people of the society
 unhone kaha ki maine sadan main sawaal bhi kiya tha ki muslimon ke aarakshan ke liye kya kadam uthaae gaye hai
 He said that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had made it clear that all the downtrodden people will be given reservation, irrespective of the backward society, whether they are Muslims
 unhone kaha ki ham anyaay ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahe hai or aage bhi ladate rahenge
 AIMIMAIMIM MLA Imtiaz Jalil, who will go to court for 5% reservation, said that MIM is in the process of knocking on the door for 5% reservation for Muslims
 congress-ensipi muslim vidhayakon ko muslim samudaay se lenaa dena nahin he
 He said that on the basis of which the Maratha community was given reservation, such a poor section is also in the Muslim society
 isliye dharm ke aadhaar par aarakshan nakaarne kii baat karanevaali sarkaar ko court main chunauti denge
 Will present in the data court to prove the backwardness of the Muslim class
 kya kaha ovaisi neeimm adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ne maharashtra main muslimon ke liye aarakshan kii maang karte hue kaha he ki muslim bhi aarakshan ke hakdaar hai kyonki pidiyon tak ve garibi main rahe hai
 Owaisi wrote on Twitter that it is an injustice to deprive backward Muslims in employment and education
 main lagaataar kahata aayaa hum ki muslim samudaay main aisi pichhadi jatiyaan hai jo pidiyon se garibi main he
 They can be taken out through reservation
 Depriving backward Muslims of their fair share in public employment & education is a grave injustice
 I've consistently argued that there are backward castes in Muslims who have lived for generations in a cycle of poverty
 Reservation is a tool that will break this cyclepic

 com / oc8ls5rdxa— Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi)november 29, 2018maharashtra main maratha aarakshan ko mili manzoorimaharashtra main maratha aarakshan ko cabinet kii manjuuri ke baad mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne guuruuvaar ko ise vidhansabha main pesh kiya
 Fadnavis, playing a big bet, introduced a 16 percent Maratha reservation bill based on the recommendation of the Backward Commission, which passed by voice
 baad main vidhaan parishad ne bhi is bill par apni muhar laga di
 Special category SEBC has been created for Maratha reservation
 maharashtra main 76 fisadi marathi kheti-kisaani or mazdooree kar jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 At the same time only 6 percent people are in government-semi-government jobs
 'iconomic times' kii khabar he ki aay se adhik sampatti par 200 fisadi kaa jurmaana kaise lagaaein, ise lekar iskar adhikari asamanjas main hai
 The finance ministry official announced this soon after the demonetisation
 iskar adhikariyon ne kaha he ki kanoon main aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he, jiske tahat bainkon main nagad jamaa hone par 200 fisadi jurmaana laga saken
 What will someone do if he deposits a crore amount in the bank, pays 33% tax, and shows his money in the income tax return of 2017-18
 iskar adhikariyon ne akhbaar ko bataaya he ki iske liye back date se iskar kanoon main badlaav karnaa hoga
 If you pay 200 percent fine, then all the money will go to the state treasury
 akhbaar 'iti' ne yah bhi likhaa he ki hazaron kii sankhya main trek haive par khadey ho gaye hai
 90% of 30 lakh trucks have been suspended for two days
 isse zaruri chizon kii aapurti main dikkat aa sakati he or daam bad sakate hai
 Along with the return of note, consumers will have to contribute happily to this national festival by paying a higher price
 agar sarkaar sakht he to transport or logistic sector main cash se hone vaale kaam ko band kar dena chahie
 Can she do that 
 
 ? trek kaa driver credit card se to rishwat nahin degaa na
 
 
 The How would you eat food at the dhaba
 
 
 ? agar puri tarah se cash band nahin ho saktaa, to kuch pratishat tay hona chahie, taaki balidaan kii qatari main lagi janata ko bharosa ho ki kaale dhan vaale sahi main pareshaan hai
 Second, we have to understand that the transport sector has to depend on cash
 overloding kaa koi vikalp nahin ban paaya he
 No one has been able to stop earning in its name
 hamaare raajnneetik dal jab sarkaar main aate hai, to yahi sector unke chunaav kaa karcha or agle chunaav kaa sansaadhan jutaney main bahut yogadan karata he, taaki un dalon ke netaa bhrashtachar ke kilaaf bhaashan dekar ladane kaa abhinay kar saken
 It is not that the government does not know about RTO
 agast, 2014 main pune kii ek sabha main parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha tha ki jaldi hi ek kanoon laakar artio system samaapt kar denge
 Is the RTO system finished? 
 
 ? do saal se zyaada samay biit chukaa he
 The government has told that within three days of demonetisation, Rs 3 lakh crore has been deposited in banks and 50,000 crore has been withdrawn
 ab yahaan kuch sawaal banate hai
 Is three lakh crores completely black money
 
 
 ? agar sarkaar, bank yaa reserve bank itani jaldi bainkon main jamaa total paisa bataa sakate hai, to kya kuch or sawaalon ke jawaab mil sakate hai
 
 
 The Out of this three lakh crores, how much amount has to be deposited with the old notes
 kitni raashi das or paanch hazaar se kam kii he
 How much money has been deposited in the account of women
 unhen or kisaanon ko dhai lakh tak kii raashi jamaa hone par tex or poochtacha se chhot mili he
 Can the Reserve Bank tell how much money was deposited in the rural sector and how much money was deposited in big cities like mumbai-delhi
 ek akhbaar main agra se report chhapi he ki jan-dhan khaaton main kai karod rupee jamaa hue hai
 If that report is correct then the government should also tell how much money was deposited in crores of Jan Dhan accounts across the country
 zero jan-dhan khaaton main kitna oochaal aayaa he
 The government has also been telling how much money has been accumulated in public money, so why is it not telling this time
 abhi ise ujagar karne se yah ho saktaa he ki in khaaton ke zariye kaala dhan safed karne waalon par ankush lag saktaa he
 We will also know that jan-dhan accounts are not being used
 teen lakh karod ke aankade se ek chhavi to banati he, magar vah asli tasviir nahin he
 After three lakh crores, this amount can reach 10 lakh crores
 ho saktaa he ki kaaphi paisa saamaanya kaarobaari gatividhiyon kaa ho
 Has he also been included in three lakh crores
 notebandi se pehle bainkon main aamtaur par kitne lakh karod rupee jamaa ho rahe the
 
 
 The The Economic Times has written that between 9 to 12 November, 1 lakh 67 thousand crore transactions took place in the morning
 isamen se 45,000 karod ke puraane note jamaa hue
 That too only at State Bank of India
 buudhvaar se esbiai main 75,945 karod jamaa hua he
 15,000 crores in Bank of India and four thousand crores in Central Bank of India
 akhbaar ke anusaar nijee bainkon ne apane aankade jari nahin kiye hai
 It is important to consider these zodiac signs as old notes and black money
 agar sabhi kaala dhan nahin he, to phir kyon bataaya ja rahaa he yaa ise bataane kii jaldi kya he
 It also means that we can know every day, how much of the old notes are deposited after 9 November, and how much money is from electronic to all business transactions
 kai tarah se sunne main aa rahaa he ki bainkon se baahar alag-alag bahikhaaton main kaale dhan ko edjust kiya ja rahaa he
 Does the government have any way of tracking such rigging? 
 
 ? yani kya sarkaar electronic tareeke se jaan sakati he ki companiyon ke bahikhaaton main kis tarah se oochaal aa rahaa he
 If these people survive then what is the use? kai bijness akhabaaron ko gaur se dekha
 Articles have stopped coming on how much the purchase of gold has increased
 thos jaankaree nahin he
 There is news of raiding in a few shops, while there are millions of shops in this country
 sarkaar kii agenciyaan yah kyon nahin bataa rahi hai ki in chaar dinon main sona yaa property ke zariye kitna nivesh hua
 Two to four big actions will become the answer to these questions, but they cannot be the answer
 pratik ke taur par do–teen badi karrwai kar dijie, vaahvahee batorie or baaki sawaalon ko chhodkar chalate banie
 a report by Harish Damodaran was published in the Indian Express of May 2, 2016
 unhone bataaya he ki march, 2016 kii vaarshik samaapti par bainkon main jamaa raashi sirf 9
 It has increased by only 9 percent
 dipoggit main single disit kii yah naubat 1962-63 main hi darj hui thi
 That is, his condition was deteriorating when he saw the deposits in banks
 harish damodaran ne kai kaarnon kaa vishleshan karte hue likhaa he ki yah mumkin he ki logon kii aamadani hi nahin bad rahi he, isliye bainkon kii jamaa raashi aitihaasik rup se ghat rahi he
 So is all this exercise to save the sick banks
 
 
 ?tippaniyan The 'business Standard' newspaper has prepared a chart of how much tax you will have to pay on black money, how much penalty you have to pay
 alag-alag sharton ke saath chart main bataaya gaya he ki kitna tex lagegaa or kitna jurmaana
 The newspaper has said that if you have an undisclosed amount of five lakh rupees, do not pay any tax, then you will have to pay 20,600 tax on it
 iskaa 200 fisadi jurmaana hua 41,200
 That is, you can make white by giving only 61,800 of black money of five lakhs
 agar yah hisaab sahi he to phir to yah skim kuch or nahin, nagdi kaale dhan rakhane waalon ke liye happy diwaali he
 You have to pay only 12 percent tax and penalty on the undisclosed amount of five lakh
 agar aap paanch lakh kii aay par tex dete rahe hai or aapke paas ek karod kii aghoshit raashi nikalati he to us par jurmaana or panelti milakar 87,29,250 rupee dene honge
 87 percent tax will be levied
 phir bhi 13 lakh rupaya safed ho jayega
 If there is even 13 lakhs left with the thief, then understand that he remained the king
 aaj ke daur main soochnaaon or tathyon kii koi ahmiyat nahin he
 Fatty thing has gone to the people that historical action has been taken against black money
 paanch sau or hazaar ke note band ho gaye hai
 Many types of questions are being ignored
 tivi or akhabaaron kii tasveeron main sirf garib or aam log hi pareshaan kyon hai
 While these are the people who are wholeheartedly supporting the government
 kaala dhan mit gaya he, agar iskaa daawa he to saare tathy kahaan hai
 If industry and business had black money, then why is there no public outcry among them
 sarkaar unke bare main kyon nahin kuch bataa rahi he, taaki qatari main khadey logon main or sabar paidaa ho sake ki ve aitihaasik rup se apana rashtriya daayitv nibhaa rahe hai
 The newspaper 'ET' has also written that thousands of trucks have parked on the highway
 30 lakh trakon kaa 90 fisadi hissaa do dinon se thama hua he
 This can cause problems in the supply of essential commodities and may increase prices
 note-vaapasi ke saath-saath upabhoktaaon ko adhik daam dekar bhi is rashtriya parv main khushi-khushi yogadan dena hoga
 If the government is strict then cash work in the transport and logistics sector should be stopped
 kya vah aisa kar sakati he
 
 
 The The driver of the truck will not give a bribe with a credit card
 
 
 ? dhabas par khaanaa kaise khayega
 
 
 The If the cash cannot be completely closed, then some percentage must be fixed, so that the people in the line of sacrifice can be confident that the black-moneyed people are in trouble
 doosraa, transport sector ko cash par nirbhar rahanaa hota he, yah bhi hamen samajhnaa hoga
 There is no option of overloading
 iske naam par hone vaali kamai bhi koi nahin roak sakaa he
 When our political parties come into the government, this sector contributes greatly to the expenses of their elections and to mobilize the resources for the next election, so that the leaders of those parties can act by giving speeches against corruption
 aisa nahin he ki artio ke bare main sarkaar ko pataa nahin
 In August 2014, at a meeting in Pune, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the RTO system would be abolished soon by introducing a law
 kya artio system samaapt ho chukaa he
 
 
 The More than two years have passed
 sarkaar ne bataaya he ki notebandi ke teen din ke bheetar bainkon main teen lakh karod rupee jamaa hue hai or 50,000 karod nikaale gaye hai
 Now some questions are made here
 kya teen lakh karod puri tarah se kaala dhan he
 
 
 The If the government, banks or Reserve Bank can tell the total money deposited in banks so soon, then some other questions can be answered
 
 
 ? is teen lakh karod main se kitni raashi puraane noton ke jamaa karne kii he
 What amount is less than ten and five thousand
 auraton ke khate main kitne paise jamaa hue hai
 He and farmers are exempted from tax and inquiries on deposits of up to Rs 2
5 lakh
 kya reserve bank bataa saktaa he ki gramin sector main kitne paise jamaa hue or mumbai-dilli jaise bade shaharon main kitne paise jamaa hue
 Reports from Agra have appeared in a newspaper that several crores of rupees have been deposited in Jan Dhan accounts
 agar vah report sahi he to sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki deshbhar main karodon jan-dhan khaaton main kitne paise jamaa hue
 What a jump in Zero Jan Dhan accounts
 sarkaar bataati bhi rahi he ki jan-dhan main kitna paisa jamaa hua he, to is baar kyon nahin bataa rahi he
 By exposing it now, it may happen that those who black money through these accounts can be curbed
 hamen bhi pataa chalegaa ki jan-dhan khaaton kaa istamaal to nahin ho rahaa he
 The figure of three lakh crores makes an image, but it is not the real picture
 teen lakh karod ke baad yah rakam 10 lakh karod tak bhi pahunch sakati he
 a lot of money may be from normal business activities
 kya use bhi teen lakh karod main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 Before demonetisation, how many lakh crore rupees were usually deposited in banks
 
 
 ? 'iconomic times' ne likhaa he ki 9 se 12 november ke bich subah-subah 1 lakh 67 hazaar karod kaa len-dein hua
 Of this, 45,000 crore old notes were deposited
 vah bhi sirf state bank of india main
 75,945 crore has been deposited in SBI since Wednesday
 bank of india main 15,000 karod or central bank of india main chaar hazaar karod
 According to the newspaper, private banks have not released their figures
 in raashiyon ko puraane note or kaale dhan ke rup main samajhnaa zaruri he
 If not all black money, then why is it being told or what is the hurry to tell it
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki ham rose kaa rose jaan sakate hai ki 9 november ke baad jo raashi jamaa hui he, usamen se kitne puraane noton ke jamaa hone kii he or kitne paise electronic se lekar tamaam kaarobaari transaction ke hai
 It is heard in many ways that black money is being adjusted in different books outside the banks
 kya sarkaar ke paas is tarah kii herapheri ko trek karne kaa koi zariyaa he
 
 
 The That is, can the government know electronically how the companies' books are going up
 agar yahi log batch gaye to phir kya phayda
 Looked at many business newspapers carefully
 sone kii kareed kitni badi, is par to lekh aane bhi band ho gaye hai
 There is no concrete information
 ekaadh dukaanon main chhapemari kii khabar he, jabaki is desh main lakhon dukaane hai
 Why are the government agencies not telling how much investment was made through gold or property in these four days
 do-chaar badi karravaaiyaan in sawaalon kaa jawaab ban jaaengi, magar ve jawaab nahin ho saktin
 Do two to three big actions as a symbol, get accolades and leave the rest of the questions and keep going
 2 may, 2016 ke 'indian express' main harish damodaran kii ek report chhapi thi
 He has stated that at the annual end of March 2016, deposits in banks were only 9
 9 pratishat hi badi he
 This single-digit case in the deposit was registered only in 1962-63
 yani bainkon main jamaa raashi ko dekhen to unki haalat karaab chal rahi thi
 Harish Damodaran has written, analyzing several reasons, that it is possible that people's income is not only increasing, so the deposits of banks are historically decreasing
 to kya yah sari kavayad biimaar bainkon ko bachaane kii he
 
 
 ? Comments 'bijness standard' akhbaar ne to baqayada chart nikaala he ki kitne ke kaale dhan par aapako kitna tex dena hoga, kitna jurmaana dena hoga
 The chart with different terms states how much tax will be levied and how much fine
 akhbaar ne bataaya he ki agar aapke paas paanch lakh rupee kii aghoshit raashi he, koi tex nahin dete rahe hai, to aapako us par 20,600 tex dena hoga
 Its 200 percent fine was 41,200
 yani aap paanch lakh kaa kaala dhan sirf 61,800 dekar safed kar sakate hai
 If this calculation is correct, then this scheme is nothing else, Happy Diwali for cash black money holders
 aapako paanch lakh kii aghoshit raashi par sirf 12 pratishat tex or panelti deni hogi
 If you have been paying tax on the income of five lakhs and you have an undisclosed amount of one crore, then you will have to pay a fine of Rs 87,29,250 including the penalty and penalty
 87 fisadi tex lag jayega
 Yet 13 lakh rupees will turn white
 chor ke paas 13 lakh bhi batch jaaen to samajhiye ki vah raja hi rahaa
 In today's era, information and facts are not important
 moti baat logon main chali gai he ki kaale dhan ke kilaaf aitihaasik karrwai hui he
 Five hundred and thousand notes have ceased
 kai tarah ke sawaalon ko andekha kiya ja rahaa he
 Why are only the poor and common people upset in the pictures of TV and newspapers
 jabaki yahi ve log hai, jo puure man se sarkaar kaa samarthan bhi kar rahe hai
 Black money has been erased, if it is claimed then where are all the facts
 agar udyog jagat or kaarobaar jagat ke paas kaala dhan tha, to unke bich saarvajanik haahaakaar kyon nahin he
 Why the government is not telling anything about them, so that people standing in the queue can be more patient that they are historically performing their national responsibility
 doosraa, transport sector ko cash par nirbhar rahanaa hota he, yah bhi hamen samajhnaa hoga
 There is no option of overloading
 iske naam par hone vaali kamai bhi koi nahin roak sakaa he
 When our political parties come into the government, this sector contributes greatly to the expenses of their elections and to mobilize the resources for the next election, so that the leaders of those parties can act by giving speeches against corruption
 aisa nahin he ki artio ke bare main sarkaar ko pataa nahin
 In August 2014, at a meeting in Pune, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the RTO system would be abolished soon by introducing a law
 kya artio system samaapt ho chukaa he
 
 
 The More than two years have passed
 sarkaar ne bataaya he ki notebandi ke teen din ke bheetar bainkon main teen lakh karod rupee jamaa hue hai or 50,000 karod nikaale gaye hai
 Now some questions are made here
 kya teen lakh karod puri tarah se kaala dhan he
 
 
 The If the government, banks or Reserve Bank can tell the total money deposited in banks so soon, then some other questions can be answered
 
 
 ? is teen lakh karod main se kitni raashi puraane noton ke jamaa karne kii he
 What amount is less than ten and five thousand
 auraton ke khate main kitne paise jamaa hue hai
 He and farmers are exempted from tax and inquiries on deposits of up to Rs 2
5 lakh
 kya reserve bank bataa saktaa he ki gramin sector main kitne paise jamaa hue or mumbai-dilli jaise bade shaharon main kitne paise jamaa hue
 Reports from Agra have appeared in a newspaper that several crores of rupees have been deposited in Jan Dhan accounts
 agar vah report sahi he to sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki deshbhar main karodon jan-dhan khaaton main kitne paise jamaa hue
 What a jump in Zero Jan Dhan accounts
 sarkaar bataati bhi rahi he ki jan-dhan main kitna paisa jamaa hua he, to is baar kyon nahin bataa rahi he
 By exposing it now, it may happen that those who black money through these accounts can be curbed
 hamen bhi pataa chalegaa ki jan-dhan khaaton kaa istamaal to nahin ho rahaa he
 The figure of three lakh crores makes an image, but it is not the real picture
 teen lakh karod ke baad yah rakam 10 lakh karod tak bhi pahunch sakati he
 a lot of money may be from normal business activities
 kya use bhi teen lakh karod main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 Before demonetisation, how many lakh crore rupees were usually deposited in banks
 
 
 ? 'iconomic times' ne likhaa he ki 9 se 12 november ke bich subah-subah 1 lakh 67 hazaar karod kaa len-dein hua

 75,945 crore has been deposited in SBI since Wednesday
 bank of india main 15,000 karod or central bank of india main chaar hazaar karod
 According to the newspaper, private banks have not released their figures
 in raashiyon ko puraane note or kaale dhan ke rup main samajhnaa zaruri he
 If not all black money, then why is it being told or what is the hurry to tell it
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki ham rose kaa rose jaan sakate hai ki 9 november ke baad jo raashi jamaa hui he, usamen se kitne puraane noton ke jamaa hone kii he or kitne paise electronic se lekar tamaam kaarobaari transaction ke hai
 It is heard in many ways that black money is being adjusted in different books outside the banks
 kya sarkaar ke paas is tarah kii herapheri ko trek karne kaa koi zariyaa he
 
 
 The That is, can the government know electronically how the companies' books are going up
 agar yahi log batch gaye to phir kya phayda
 Looked at many business newspapers carefully
 sone kii kareed kitni badi, is par to lekh aane bhi band ho gaye hai
 There is no concrete information
 ekaadh dukaanon main chhapemari kii khabar he, jabaki is desh main lakhon dukaane hai
 Why are the government agencies not telling how much investment was made through gold or property in these four days
 do-chaar badi karravaaiyaan in sawaalon kaa jawaab ban jaaengi, magar ve jawaab nahin ho saktin
 Do two to three big actions as a symbol, get accolades and leave the rest of the questions and keep going
 2 may, 2016 ke 'indian express' main harish damodaran kii ek report chhapi thi

 9 pratishat hi badi he
 This single-digit case in the deposit was registered only in 1962-63
 yani bainkon main jamaa raashi ko dekhen to unki haalat karaab chal rahi thi
 Harish Damodaran has written, analyzing several reasons, that it is possible that people's income is not only increasing, so the deposits of banks are historically decreasing

 The chart with different terms states how much tax will be levied and how much fine
 akhbaar ne bataaya he ki agar aapke paas paanch lakh rupee kii aghoshit raashi he, koi tex nahin dete rahe hai, to aapako us par 20,600 tex dena hoga
 Its 200 percent fine was 41,200
 yani aap paanch lakh kaa kaala dhan sirf 61,800 dekar safed kar sakate hai
 If this calculation is correct, then this scheme is nothing else, Happy Diwali for cash black money holders
 aapako paanch lakh kii aghoshit raashi par sirf 12 pratishat tex or panelti deni hogi
 If you have been paying tax on the income of five lakhs and you have an undisclosed amount of one crore, then you will have to pay a fine of Rs 87,29,250 including the penalty and penalty
 87 fisadi tex lag jayega

 Why the government is not telling anything about them, so that people standing in the queue can be more patient that they are historically performing their national responsibility
 ek akhbaar main agra se report chhapi he ki jan-dhan khaaton main kai karod rupee jamaa hue hai
 If that report is correct then the government should also tell how much money was deposited in crores of Jan Dhan accounts across the country
 zero jan-dhan khaaton main kitna oochaal aayaa he
 The government has also been telling how much money has been accumulated in public money, so why is it not telling this time
 abhi ise ujagar karne se yah ho saktaa he ki in khaaton ke zariye kaala dhan safed karne waalon par ankush lag saktaa he
 We will also know that jan-dhan accounts are not being used
 teen lakh karod ke aankade se ek chhavi to banati he, magar vah asli tasviir nahin he
 After three lakh crores, this amount can reach 10 lakh crores
 ho saktaa he ki kaaphi paisa saamaanya kaarobaari gatividhiyon kaa ho
 Has he also been included in three lakh crores
 notebandi se pehle bainkon main aamtaur par kitne lakh karod rupee jamaa ho rahe the
 
 
 The The Economic Times has written that between 9 to 12 November, 1 lakh 67 thousand crore transactions took place in the morning
 isamen se 45,000 karod ke puraane note jamaa hue
 That too only at State Bank of India
 buudhvaar se esbiai main 75,945 karod jamaa hua he
 15,000 crores in Bank of India and four thousand crores in Central Bank of India
 akhbaar ke anusaar nijee bainkon ne apane aankade jari nahin kiye hai
 It is important to consider these zodiac signs as old notes and black money
 agar sabhi kaala dhan nahin he, to phir kyon bataaya ja rahaa he yaa ise bataane kii jaldi kya he
 It also means that we can know every day, how much of the old notes are deposited after 9 November, and how much money is from electronic to all business transactions
 kai tarah se sunne main aa rahaa he ki bainkon se baahar alag-alag bahikhaaton main kaale dhan ko edjust kiya ja rahaa he
 Does the government have any way of tracking such rigging? 
 
 ? yani kya sarkaar electronic tareeke se jaan sakati he ki companiyon ke bahikhaaton main kis tarah se oochaal aa rahaa he
 If these people survive then what is the use? kai bijness akhabaaron ko gaur se dekha
 Articles have stopped coming on how much the purchase of gold has increased
 thos jaankaree nahin he
 There is news of raiding in a few shops, while there are millions of shops in this country
 sarkaar kii agenciyaan yah kyon nahin bataa rahi hai ki in chaar dinon main sona yaa property ke zariye kitna nivesh hua
 Two to four big actions will become the answer to these questions, but they cannot be the answer
 pratik ke taur par do–teen badi karrwai kar dijie, vaahvahee batorie or baaki sawaalon ko chhodkar chalate banie
 a report by Harish Damodaran was published in the Indian Express of May 2, 2016
 unhone bataaya he ki march, 2016 kii vaarshik samaapti par bainkon main jamaa raashi sirf 9
 It has increased by only 9 percent
 dipoggit main single disit kii yah naubat 1962-63 main hi darj hui thi
 That is, his condition was deteriorating when he saw the deposits in banks
 harish damodaran ne kai kaarnon kaa vishleshan karte hue likhaa he ki yah mumkin he ki logon kii aamadani hi nahin bad rahi he, isliye bainkon kii jamaa raashi aitihaasik rup se ghat rahi he
 So is all this exercise to save the sick banks
 
 
 ?tippaniyan The 'business Standard' newspaper has prepared a chart of how much tax you will have to pay on black money, how much penalty you have to pay
 alag-alag sharton ke saath chart main bataaya gaya he ki kitna tex lagegaa or kitna jurmaana
 The newspaper has said that if you have an undisclosed amount of five lakh rupees, do not pay any tax, then you will have to pay 20,600 tax on it
 iskaa 200 fisadi jurmaana hua 41,200

 agar yah hisaab sahi he to phir to yah skim kuch or nahin, nagdi kaale dhan rakhane waalon ke liye happy diwaali he
 You have to pay only 12 percent tax and penalty on the undisclosed amount of five lakh

 Fatty thing has gone to the people that historical action has been taken against black money
 paanch sau or hazaar ke note band ho gaye hai
 Many types of questions are being ignored
 tivi or akhabaaron kii tasveeron main sirf garib or aam log hi pareshaan kyon hai
 While these are the people who are wholeheartedly supporting the government
 kaala dhan mit gaya he, agar iskaa daawa he to saare tathy kahaan hai
 If industry and business had black money, then why is there no public outcry among them
 sarkaar unke bare main kyon nahin kuch bataa rahi he, taaki qatari main khadey logon main or sabar paidaa ho sake ki ve aitihaasik rup se apana rashtriya daayitv nibhaa rahe hai

 Taking the stage ahead, Manjar Bhopali read the poetry, we create tabarees from the golden day in Sab e Gham, we make pictures of mustache with wounds, our heads cannot be sent away, why do we make chains for the people today? Still here people make jagirs by wearing khadi, i have to win the game, i have the ability to make bouquets, they make masks Ain Kaif Nizam read his shayari, you were silent and my lips were also closed, who was speaking so long, who would keep on saying, i would send someone blindfolded, i would be frightened in the lonely light, send happiness for two hours
 Our big noise on Bhej Dejmeen, sent a little silence from Hakhala, the famous poet Wasim Barelvi took the stage in the end, in his eyes: Flowers are flowers, the eyes are surrounded, the thorns are in a safe defense, they do not get any time to see that they are crazy, they are crazy, they remain crazy; When we live, we live on the Taj Mahal, Wasim Barelvi also showed me when it came to the poetry of Poetry Who did not come to see me from the world, made me with the help of clay, made me think that i was sitting in the world, in the seven wonders of the world, sitting here, what happened to you that you make me cry in my own country and show me what you fall from my eyes What do you know when you are tall Wasim Barelvi, when it came to the poetry of Shayari, showed me that i wanted to make such a great person that i did not come to see me from the world, i was made of clay, i was made to be Indian; You show me the curtains in your own country, you make me fall from the eyes, what do you know, do you drop your height? Interpretation know Wasim Barelvi, when it came to the poetry of Shayari, showed me that i wanted to make such a great person that i did not come to see me from the world, i was made of clay, i was made to be Indian; You show me the curtains in your own country, you make me fall from the eyes, what do you know, do you drop your height? Interpretation know videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne shuukravaar ko bataaya ki 39 bharatiyon ko maanav taskari ke jariye iraq bhejne ke liye jimmedaar agent ab bhi apana dhandha chalaa rahaa he
 The 39 Indians sent to Iraq by this agent were abducted there and later murdered
 videsh mantri sushamaa swarajane rajya mahila aayogon se aise gaiyrkanoonee agenton ke khilaaf muhim chalaane kaa anurodh kiya
 Swaraj told Parliament in March that 39 years ago, 39 Indians held hostage by the terrorist organization ISIS in Mosul had died
 rajya mahila aayogon ke ek rashtriya sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue unhone anurodh kiya ki ayog deshbhar main chal rahe aise agenton ke gaiyrkanoonee network ke khilaaf muhim shuru kare
 He regretted that the agent who sent 39 Indians to Iraq is still sending people abroad
 External Affairs Min Sushma Swaraj says govt will make a law, 'summons and Warrants Against Indian People Living Abroad', in next session of Parliament which will make provision of confiscating property of nris who have abandoned their wives in India & illegally married abroad

 The number of new cases of HIV infection in India has declined by 46% since 2010 and the number of deaths due to AIDS (acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) has also decreased by 22%
 chikitsakon kaa kahana he ki kuch saral upaay apanaakar isbimaripar lagaam lagaai ja sakati he
 The Associate Director of Department of transfusionmedicine, Histocompatibility and Molecular Biology of Jay Hospital, Noida, Dr
 prashanth pande kaa kahana he ki aids, echivi ke kaaran hota he
 In this syndrome, the strength of the body to fight against diseases is weakened, due to which the person is easily vulnerable to any infection or other disease
 syndrome ke badhane ke saath lakshan or gambhir hote chale jate hai
 However, this serious disease can be avoided by adopting some simple remedies
 - body flud se bachein:kisi bhi anya vyakti ke khun yaa anya body flud se dur rahen, agar aap iske sampark main aate hai, to twachaa ko turant acchhee tarah dhoen
 This reduces the chance of infection
 - drugs ke injection or nidel share karnaa:kai deshon mendrugske liye istemaal kii jane vaali syringe ko share karnaa echivi failane kaa mukhya kaaran mana jaataa he
 Apart from HIV, it is also the cause of hepatitis
 isliye hameshaa saaf or nai nidel hi istemaal karen
 - Pregnancy: hiv-infected pregnant woman can have HIV infection in her child
 iske alaava stanpan karaane se bhi echivi kaa virus bachche main ja saktaa he
 However, this probability decreases if the mother is taking the appropriate medicines
 - khun chadhaane / raktaadhan ke dauraan suraksha baratna:swayan sevi raktadaataaon ke khun kii enetijanchake baad kisi ko khun dena echivi ko failane se rokane kaa surakshit tarika he
 - Do not consume medicines properly: In case of HIV, it is necessary to take medicines according to the advice of the doctor, if you skip some doses, the treatment may be interrupted, so take the full dose
 echivi se peedit logon ko apane swasthya kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie, niyamit rup se vyaayaam karen, sehatmand aahaar len or dhumrapaan na karen
 Also, visit your doctor regularly
 aids ke lakshan ke bare main bataate hue dow
 Prashant Pandey said that some people do not show symptoms of the disease for several months after HIV infection
 haalanki 80 fisadi maamalon main do se chah saptaah ke bheetar flu jaise lakshan dikhne lagate hai
 This is called acute retroviral syndrome
 echivi sankraman kelakshanhain bukhaar, thand laganaa, jodon main dard, mansapeshiyon main dard, pasinaa aana (khaastaur par raat main), grathiyon kaa aakaar badhanaa, twachaa par laal rash, thakaan, bina kisi kaaran ke vajan main kami
 Dr
 explaining its diagnosis
 prashanth pande ne kaha, "echivi kaa nidaan blad test screening kii madad se kiya jaataa he
 If HIV is found in it, the test result is 'positive'
 'positive' parinaam dene se pehle khun kii kai baar jaanch kii jaati he
 "he said," This is evident in investigations within three weeks to six months after the HIV virus infection
 jitani jaldi iskaa nidaan ho jaae, utana hi ilaaj kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 It is very common for a person to have stress or depression when he is diagnosed with HIV
 agar aap aise lakshanon se pareshaan hai to turant doctor kii salaah len

 karnataka ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad ab echdi kumaraswami ke saamne chunavi vaadon ko puraa karne kii chunauti khadi ho gai he
 The challenge before them is to forgive the debt of 53 thousand crore rupees of the farmers of the state
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan jedies ne vaada kiya tha ki soobe main sarkaar banane ke 24 ghante ke andar 53 hajaar karod rupee kaa krishi rin maaf kiya jayega
 Kumaraswamy said after taking the oath, 'I do not say that i will not forgive the loan
 maine kaha tha ki hamaari party ke sarkaar main aane par ham saare lone maaf kar denge
 But now i am in a coalition government, so now i have to take them into confidence as well
 vaise mere paas iskaa blueprint he
 i will discuss this with Congress leaders
 ' yani kumaraswami ne kisaanon kii karjamaafee par saaf kuch nahin kaha he
 Let me tell you that before this, for two and a half days, Yeddyurappa became the CM and after taking the oath of Chief Minister, he said, 'as per my promise, i announce the debt waiver of the farmers
 ' unhone kisaanon kaa 1 lakh tak kaa karj maaf kar diya tha
 However, his government fell due to lack of proving majority and the debt waiver decision could not materialize
 aapako bataa den ki kisaanon kii karj maafee karnataka main bada chunavi mudda rahaa he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi in his rallies had discussed much about the debt waiver of the former CM Siddaramaiah
 ab congress is sarkaar main sahyogi dal kii bhoomika he or uske paas dipti siem kaa pad he
 Congress state president g Parameshwara has been appointed as deputy CM
 aise main kisaanon kii karjamaafee ko lekar donon dalon par dabaav hoga
 The JDS election manifesto stated that if Kumaraswamy becomes the chief minister and comes to power in Karnataka, agricultural loans worth Rs 53,000 crore with interest will be forgiven within 24 hours
 ab kumaraswami mukhyamantri ban gaye hai or soobe main jedies kii sarkaar bhi ban gai he
 However, this government is of coalition, that is, JDS has formed a government with the Congress
 darasal, is chunaav main kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko spasht bahumat nahin mila or bijepi 104 siten jitkar sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 At the same time, Congress won 78 seats and JDS 37 seats
 karnataka main spasht bahumat nahin milane kii dasha main rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne sabase badi party banakar ubhari bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya or bies yediurppa ko mukhyamantri kii shapath dilaa di
 However, JDS and Congress reached the Supreme Court against the Governor's decision
 sheersh adaalat ne donon dalon kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue yediurppa ko 28 ghante ke andar yani shanivaar shaam chaar baje tak vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ko kaha, lekin wo bahumat ke liye jaruri jaadui aankade nahin juta paae or mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya
 After this, Governor Vajubhai Vala invited the njds-congress alliance to form the government and on Wednesday administered the oath of office to Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister and g Parameshwara as Deputy Chief Minister
 is tarah soobe main jedies-congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar ban gai
 It will now be interesting to see if Kumaraswamy fulfills his election promise within 24 hours
 philhal kumaraswami kii ore se is bare main spasht ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he
