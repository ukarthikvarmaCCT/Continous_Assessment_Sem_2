 View this post on instagramposted @withrepost • @niqabaechronicles TRIGGER Warning ⚠️ 🎨: @ 4nine2 Passage by @neehallee 👇🏽 "from a nightmare
 To then realize it wasn’t only just a dream
 It's been very, very, very hard and painful to keep it together
 i tried to bring myself to think & speak “positively” so it won’t bring people down even more, but who are we kidding? Sudan is mourning while the rest of the world celebrates Eid
 Mothers, fathers, children, friends, everyone is mourning a loved one
 
 ⁣ Yesterday morning, after Fajr prayer, the sit-ins in Sudan were dispersed with violence and a lot of bloodshed
 Mass shootings, beatings, rape, robbery, humiliation
 Tens murdered, hundreds injured, and tents where people were sleeping burnt
 All of this on the last day of the holy month of Ramadan
 Internet connection was also cut off at night to prevent information from reaching the rest of the world
 Today morning, they were shooting at people to disperse the Eid prayer
 People were randomly shot at / beaten in their own homes or on the streets
 Nobody is safe
 i have to fear for all my family and friends over there
 It’s now not only Darfur but the whole of Sudan fighting war criminals
 And the world is just watching
 
 Sad It's sad to see people caring more about a building burnt down or a football match than the lives of their sisters and brothers
 This is to everyone who had no idea about what’s happening in Sudan right now, and specifically those from our region, although it’s been going on for 6 months
 It's okay to not know, but it's time you leave the "not into politics" agendas and care to learn a little bit about what's happening around
 The whole world is running on politics
 You need to know about things beyond your personal interests because if it's not affecting you or someone you know at this moment, eventually it will be
 
 ⁣ If i mean anything at all to you, please avoid sympathetic comments
 All i ask of you is to search, read about what’s happening
 Share using the below hashtags
 Ask me
 Talk to your friends & family
 Help us reach more people around the world
 If you can't do that, then at least pray for Sudan
 Truly
 We need you

 Shares the tragedy of Asifa and is also sensitive to tensions in Kashmir
 ve maanati hai ki soshal media par jaagrukta failaane ke saath hi sarkaron ko kadam uthaane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he
 Zaira Wasim does not have a selfie on Instagram among the stars promoting themselves on a frightening level
 apni trips kii tasveeron ko jaayra bhale share karti hon, lekin unke posts kisi actor kii tarah kam balki maanavadhikaar samarthak activist jaise zyada lagate hai, jiskaa esthetic sens kool he
 It is clear from his Twitter posts that Zaira is sensitive to human rights and also warns people about environmental hazards
 jaahir he, unke man main bhavishya ko lekar bahut positive image nahin hi hogi
 In such a situation, she would not treat Bollywood more than a career
 jahaan mayanagari kii andhi duniya main log khub mahatvakankshi hokar nechar se apane aapako alag kar rahe hai, vahiin jaayra kaa bollywood se algaav apni jadon kii taraf waapas jane kaa rasta ho saktaa he

 lekin ve apni life main aisa kuch nahin karnaa chaahati thim
 It is also not necessary that if a career leads people on the path of fame and wealth, that path is right
 aise main jaayra kaa faisla ek kariyar switch bhi ho saktaa he
 Because like many people, Zaira is probably not comfortable with public life
 haalanki manovaigyanikon ke anusaar, kuch ghar-pariwaron main bachapan se hi dharm ko lekar ek aisi dharna bana di jaati he jo bacchon ke avchetan man main ghar kar jaati he jiske chalate jindagi bhar ve apane har kadam ko dharm ke chashme se dekhati hai
 For many humans, religion and faith are another name for hope, in such a situation, the decision of Zaira can either be the result of going blind in this religion or they really have a deep religious and spiritual mindset
 chal-kapat ke daur main sach bolnaa hi ek krantikari kaam he
 Zaira shared this quote of George Orwell before his Bollywood retirement

 Controversy has arisen due to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi signing a register kept for non-hindu visitors at the temple of Somnath
 aapako bataa den ki is register main un logon ko hastakshar karne hote hai, jo hindu nahin hai
 In such a situation, the BJP became an attacker on Rahul Gandhi and raised questions on Rahul Gandhi being a Hindu
 vahiin congress ne press conference kar is galati kii asal vajah bataai
 However, in the meantime, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said something that may again put the Congress in controversy
 congress ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki rahul sirf hindu hi nahin janeudhari hindu hai
 BJP has nothing in its hands
 sabakuch modi or shah ke haath main hai
 Ram Vilas Paswan said that he had nothing in his hand
 vahincongresane yah bhi kaha ki rahul gandhi bhagwaan shiv ke bhakt hai or unke khilaaf sajeesh karne waalon ko bhagwaan maaf nahin karenge
 Let me tell you that a few days ago after praying at Veer Meghmaya temple in Patan, Gujarat, Rahul said, 'I am a devotee of Shiva, believe in truth, whatever BJP says, i believe in my truth
 ’ congress ne yah bhi kaha ki rahul gandhi ne register main hastakshar nahin kiya tha
 Deepender Hooda has said in a press conference that his party does not know who has handed over Rahul Gandhi to him
 unhone kaha he ki rahul gandhi apane naam main swayan ko rahul gandhi ji kyon likhenge
 According to sources, Congress co-ordinator Manoj Tyagi had entered the visitor's book on behalf of him and Ahmed Patel
 aapako bataa den ki is baar rahul gandhi va congress party aisa kar chunaav main shoft hindutv kaa sahaara le rahi he
 In such a situation, there is a danger of the Hindu vote bank going into the BJP camp
 yahi vajah he ki rahul kii is chook kaa bijepi phayda lene kii soch rahi he
 'followed Hinduism' Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said that all this is a conspiracy of BJP and it is unfortunate
 surajevaala ne bijepi ko itnaa neeche nahin girane kii salaah di
 He said that if Rahul Gandhi goes to take the blessings of Dwarkadhish, then BJP too has objection in this
 randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki media ke kuch logon kaa istemaal kar farji register kii copy viral kii gayi
 He said that Rahul Gandhi is not only a Hindu, but he is a Janeudhari Hindu
 pita ke shav kii asthiyaan chunane kaa kaam ho yaa bahan kii shaadi ho, in sabhi main unhone hindu dharm kaa paalan kiya
 Surjewala told the BJP that it should not fall even below Hades
 ho saktaa he vivadapako bataa den ki congress ke janeudhari hindu bayaan par bhi vivaad ho saktaa he
 BJP is already accusing Congress of casteist election in Gujarat elections
 aise main congress ke is bayaan se dalit varg naaraaz ho sakate hai
 The identity of Janeu is associated with the upper caste, in such a situation that the Congress, which has taken the Patidar with him on issues such as reservation, employment, does not harm the votes of the Dalit society with this statement

 The hundred days of the new government were completed
 tamaam survey or report philhal uske paksh main hai
 The public feels that this government is working correctly
 vah sarkaar ke mukhiya ke kaam kaaj ke tareeke se bhi santusht dikhti he
 Improvement in the administration of the country is visible and the growth rate has increased
 aisa lag rahaa he ki arthvyavastha patari par laut rahi he
 There is an atmosphere of excitement in the stock markets
 sensex ek nai oonchai par ja rahaa he or kai sheyaron ke daam to saal ke adhiktam par ja pahunche hai
 The fragrance of foreign investment has started
 lekin in sabake baavjood manhagaai ek aisa mudda rahaa jis par sarkaar ghirti najar aa rahi he
 The previous government has been trying to curb inflation for many years but could not do anything
 natijatan use lok sabha chunaav main karaari maat khaani padi
 Inflation is a very sensitive subject
 yah aadmi ke pet se judaa hua he
 The inflation of food items spoils the budget of common households
 vah use takalif detii he or uske bhavishya ko khatre main daal detii he
 The voter can bear everything but not the ever increasing inflation
 uske liye yah ek takalifdeh mudda he jiskaa vah fouran hal chahta he
 The Modi government has taken many small and big steps during its tenure
 kai badi ghoshnaaen bhi huin
 Various schemes were also made
 lekin mahangaai par kahin koi charchaa nahin
 No responsible leader or official is talking about this
 jaahir he jab is samvedansheel or jatil mudde par koi charchaa nahin hogi to iskaa samaadhaan kaise nikalegaa? yah aisa mudda he jis par jamkar charchaa or bahes honi chahie thi kyonki mahangaai bharat ke liye ab sthaayee mudda ban gaya he
 Now its long-term solution should be talked about and solutions should be found
 kuch khaadya padaarth aise hai jinke daam akasar bad jate hai or vah sarkaar ke gale kii fans ban jaataa he
 How to get rid of them? There should be meetings on what long-term policy should be made to deal with inflation
 jamaakhoron or munafkhoron ke khilaaf kya karrvai ho, is par aam raay banani chahie
 Farmers get the right price for their produce and reach the customer at a reasonable price
 bichauliyon kii bhoomika par kaise ankush lage, yah bahut hi bada vishay he
 All such theoretical and practical steps should be taken to control inflation
 ab dekhnaa he ki nai sarkaar is chunauti kaa kaise saamana karti he
 It cannot be resolved only by relying on good monsoon
 mahangaai kii aag ko sthaayee rup se bujhaana hoga taaki isaki aanch raisina road tak na pahunch jaae

 Congress's public outrage rally will be held on Sunday
 rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh banane ke baad modi sarkaar ke khilaaf ek tarah se yah unka shakti pareekshan he
 For the moment, the first such public meeting of Congress is being held in Delhi, in which one can get a glimpse of the 2019 elections
 congress ke sanghathan mahasachiv ashok gahalot ne kaha, is raily kaa jo naam he,jan aakrosh raily, uskaa apana ek sandesh he
 For the first time since independence, it is seen that there is an atmosphere of fear in all the classes
 aisa bhay kaa maahaul, aatank kaa maahaul, ghrinaa kaa maahaul, nafrat kaa maahaul, hinsa kaa maahaul pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 Gehlot said, farmers are unhappy, youth are deceived, women are unhappy, the incidence of rape has increased
 mahangaai kii maar kitni padi he, koi soch nahin saktaa
 Petrol and diesel prices are on fire
 sab record tod die or modi ne jo vaayade kiye use chaar saalon main puraa nahin kiya gaya
 Little is known about the smart city, the status of the judiciary is worrying
 bakaul ashok gahalot, log itane aakrosh se bhare hue hai ki koi kalpana nahin kar saktaa he
 In view of this situation, a public outrage rally is being organized
 desh ke log aaj jo soch rahe hai, uski jhalak is raily main dekhne ko milegi
 In addition to the President of the Congress Party, this rally was attended by Sonia Gandhi, Drs
 manmohan singh bhi sambodhit karenge
 Randeep Singh Surjewala said, Why is the Indian National Congress led by Rahul Gandhi organizing a public outrage rally, this is a natural question? There is outrage - of the snatching rights of the farmers, neither the full cost of the crop, nor the debt relief, nor the proper compensation, nor the money to acquire land according to the rights law, nor the opportunities, nor the huge crisis in the agricultural sector
 unhone kaha, aise main aakrosh kisaanon ke chhinte adhikaar kaa, aakrosh dijal or petrol kii badhati keemton se hote jindagi kii bejaar haalaton kaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi, who is standing shoulder to shoulder with Priyanka Gandhi's hardworking for Rahul's rally, does not want to leave any stone unturned for Rahul's rally
 is babat priyanka gandhi lagaataar raily main ho rahi taiyaariyon par najar banaae hue hai
 The seriousness of Priyanka Gandhi's rally can be gauged from the fact that she reached Ramlila Maidan secretly on Saturday without telling anyone and went there and took stock of all the preparations
 priyanka gandhi ne ramlila maidan main jaakar rahul gandhi kii raily ke liye banane vaali stage, raily main baithne ke intjaam, screen kahaan lagegi jaise mahatvapurn muddon par apni raay rakhi
 According to a senior Congress leader, Priyanka Gandhi comes before or after any function of the Congress and constantly monitors the situation

 agar bharat ko england ke khilaaf test siries jeetne kii sambhaavna majboot kerani he, to viraat kohli or unke saathi ballebaajon ko james anderson kii swing or seem par haaavee hona hoga
 This is to say of the fast bowler Glenn mcgrath of Australia's own era
 maikgra ne chennai main kaha, ‘anderson sabase ahm khilaadi hoga
 It remains to be seen how the Indian batsmen cope with their swing and fast bowling conditions in England
 agar ve anderson par haaavee hokar khelte hai, to isse unke liye bada antar paidaa hoga
 mcgrath, coaching director at MRF Pace Foundation, said that even though the Indian bowlers have done well recently, batting is still their strong side
 england: drow hua bharat or asex ke bich khelaa ja rahaa abhyaas machaunhone kaha, ‘ yah dilachasp hone ja rahaa he
 India got off to a really good start in England, of course it was in odis and T20s
 ballebaaji hameshaa unka majboot paksh rahaa he
 Just heard about the injury of (jaspreet) Bumrah and Bhuvi (bhuvaneshwar Kumar)
 isliye yah unki gendbaaji line-ap ko dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki koun mukhya jimmedaari uthaata he
 "he bowled really well in recent times," mcgrath said
 chot lagati rahi hai
 This will make some work difficult, but their strong side is batting
 ’ unhone kaha ki bharat ke liye spinneron ne acha pradarshan kiya he or ve england main bhi apni bhoomika nibhaayenge, lekin tej gendbaaj mahatvapurn honge
 mcgrath said, "the spinners are doing a good job for India
" shen worne ko bhi vahaan gendbaaji pasand thi
 He always said that if the pitch would help the seamer, he would also get a turn
 england kii paristhitiyon main gend se worne ko safalataa mili he
 If India wants to win the series, its spinners will have to dominate the batsmen

 She was friendly on her channel

 Everyone had felt that pain across the border
 aaj subah jab main apane bachche ko skool bhejne ke liye taiyaar kar rahaa tha to sahasaa uski yaad aa gai
 i talk to my child a lot while preparing to send to school

 Today, when i saw that reporter crying to make me a corpse, my eyes were filled too
 vah ek maa thi
 Whom would he have woken up to this morning by not having the child on his bed
 koi aawaaj bhi to nahin suni hogi usne
 After all, who would have made breakfast? lunch box nahin dikhaa hoga
 
 
 The water bottle may not be visible

 It takes years to create a dream and it does not take even a moment to disintegrate
 us maa ne apane bachapan ko us bachche main mahasoos kiya hoga

 kai-kai sapane uski ankhon main ghar kar gaye honge
 But all those dreams were shattered in a moment
 chand dhamaakon ne un sapanom ko chithde main tabdeel kar diya tha
 Leaving her child at the school gate and returning
 vah campus ke bheetar jate hue haath hilaakar by bol rahaa tha
 There was the usual smile on his face and the glow of hope in his eyes

 vah maa abhi apane bachche ko skool nahin bhej pai he
 He has not heard the chirping voice of his child, the shaking hands, the words spoken by him
 
 
 
 And today, she may not have even heard Ajan, even the tweet of the birds in the morning and she has been sitting in the thought that
 
 
 abhi to shaam dhali he, raat hui he
 Then it will be morning
 ajaan bhi sunuungi, pakshi chahchahaayenge
 
 
 Then i will give voice vah kunmunate hue bistar chhodega
 
 
 i will make breakfast for him, pack a lunch box, keep a water bottle
 usase skool kii baaten karuungi
 
 
 He would shake hands while going to school
 muskaate hue by bolegaa

 But on September 12, Akhilesh showed two controversial ministers Gayatri Prajapati and Raj Kishore Singh a way out in the wake of allegations of corruption
 2
 The very next day, Mulayam Singh Yadav removed his son Akhilesh from the post of head of the state unit and installed Bhai Shivpal
 3
 On September 13, Akhilesh took away three portfolios from his uncle Shishpal
 4
 On the same day, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav removed Chief Secretary Deepak Singhal, considered close to Shivpal
 5
 On September 15, Mulayam met his son Akhilesh and brother Shivpal and tried to convince them
 do din baad akhilesh ne chachaa shivpal se mulaakaat kar kaha ki party ke bheetar koi matbhed nahin he
 6
 18 sitambar ko akhilesh ne chachaa ko waapas mantrimandal main le liya lekin phir agle din shivpal ne akhilesh ke saat vishwaasapatro ko party se baahar kar diya
 Despite this, on 26 September, Akhilesh re-inducted Gayatri Prajapati into the cabinet
 7
 On 27 September, Akhilesh supported his confidants fired by uncle Shivpal, saying he was an experienced leader and advised the Speaker to reconsider the decision
 8
 In early October, Shivpal named Amarmani Tripathi, the murder accused, as the SP candidate and announced the merger of Mukhtar Ansari's party, the Qaumi Ekta Dal

 a week later, Akhilesh again removed Uncle Shivpal and his three trusted ministers from the ministry
 10
 The biggest reason behind the results of the latest situation was the Chief Minister released a parallel list of 235 candidates, ignoring the pro-akhilesh activists from the list of candidates released by the party for the 2017 assembly elections

 reliance jeeyo ne sim or mobile se market diserpt kiya tha or ab company taiyaari kar rahi he pement bank kii
 According to reports, Reliance Jio can launch its payment bank by the end of this year i
e
 in December
 yah pement bank RIL yani reliance industries limited or state bank of india ke saath partnership karke kholaa jayega
 According to Live Mint's report, it will be launched only in December
 haalanki report main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki reliance industries limited kechairman mukesh ambani pement bank kosio phone ke saath hi launch karnaa chaahate the
 But the Reserve Bank of India had asked Jio to demonstrate its capability and also prove that the company is full of all the regulations before launch
 report main ise hi pement bank launch main der hone kii vajah bataaya he
 It is to be noted that Jio is not the first company that is preparing to bring a payment bank
 isse pehle desh kii sabase badi telecom company airtel ne pement bank launch kiya he
 State Bank will also benefit from Jio's payment bank
 kyonki ab reliance jeeyo ke customers gaanv main bhi he or company apana network badha rahi he
 Reliance Jio phone has also been targeted to sell the company in the rural area first
 pement bank se kya hoga phaaydarijrv bank kii guideline ke mutabik pment bank kisi bhi customer kaa seaving acount khol sakate hai
 Users can deposit up to Rs 1 lakh
 pement bank debit card bhi jari kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, there will also be offers for utility bill payments
 itnaa hi nahin pement banks ke paas customer ko simple finantial products jaise mutual products or insurance dene kaa bhi opshan hoga
 It will be beneficial for small business, because under this, salary can be opened in the payment bank for the business of five to six employees
 yani agar jeeyo ne pement bank launch kiya to phir se kai nae ophers mil sakate hai
 Apart from this, debit card of Jio can also come from which you can conduct transactions
 kul mila kar pement bank se mobile ke jariye banking kaaphi aasaan hogi or iske liye bainkon ke chakkar lagane se nijaat bhi milegaa
 However it also has its own scope which makes it different from banking

 ' The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) accused Digvijay Singh that the Congress leaders were behaving like a 'roadblock'
 digvijay singh ne sangh par ‘aatankwaad failaane’ or ‘bam factory banane’ jaise aarope lagaaye the
 Senior RSS pracharak Ram Madhav said that neither Singh's party nor the government takes his words seriously
 ujjain main ravivaar ko singh ke samarthakon or bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke bich kathith sangharsh par pratikriya dete hue madhav ne kaha, ‘hamen is sthiti par dayaa aati he jab digvijay singh jaise varisht netaa apane ko is haal main pate hai
 He is behaving like a roadside
 hamen unpar dayaa aati he
 He alleged that the senior Congress leader is now seen on the road with some unknown people, possibly with anti-social elements

 ' upi main modi magic ke sahare bijepi banpar jeet kii ore he

 phir chalaa modi magicaupi main bijepi kii jeet kaa sabase bada kaaran modi magic kaa phir se chalanaa he
 The Modi government may be close to completing three years at the center, but trust in Modi is not diminishing
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upi main modi magic chalaa tha or upi kii 80 main 73 siton par bijepi or sahyogia kaa kabja ho gaya tha
 The BJP was in the battle of UP with the help of this magic
 ab do tihaai se zyada siten bijepi ko aati dikh rahi hai
 This is directly Modi magic

 The SP disputes the loss of Akhilesh and the Congress, even though it was presenting the data of votes on the basis of alliance, but the result is in front of everyone
 sapa-congress gathbandhan kaa haalat ekadam kharaab ho gai
 The reason for Akhilesh's departure from power is believed to be the arrogance in the Mulayam family and then the SP government ministers coming into dispute one after another
 paariwarik ghamaasan se ubarkar akhilesh ne khud kii chhavi pesh to kii lekin anti inkambency factor kaa unhen saamana karnaa padaa
 The Akhilesh government came under the question of the name of minister Gayatri Prajapati being named in the rape case and then absconding

 The BJP has won a landslide victory in the angry GUP yet not far away from the Congress
 jis congress ke saath gathbandhan kar akhilesh phir satta main vaapasi kii aas lagaae baithe the usase koi laabh nahin mila
 The Modi team benefited from the public anger against the Congress in the 2014 general elections
 upi main sonia or rahul gandhi ko chhodkar koi bhi congress ummidavaar nahin jeet paaya
 Even in the 2012 assembly elections, the Congress could not move beyond 20-22 seats
 is chunaav main bhi bijepi awwal rahi
 Sonia Gandhi did not enter the campaign and Priyanka Gandhi also held a meeting
 haalanki, akhilesh ke saath saajhe road sho or reliyaan kar rahul gandhi ne prachaar ko dhar di lekin usase koi phayda nahin mila

 mayawati kheme main 2007 jaise soshal ejineering kii kamibijepi agar upi main sabase aage dikh rahi he to mayawati factor bhi isamen bada kaaran he
 Has the BJP managed to break into the Dalit vote on which Mayawati's entire politics rests
 is chunaav main mayawati bina kisi soshal igeneering ke utrin thi
 In the 2007 elections, Mayawati had managed to combine the Brahmin and Dalit castes and won a majority on her own with this equation, but it seems difficult to repeat the story
 kam se kam agsit pole ke nattejey te yahi kehete hai
 This time the Brahmin community was not with Mayawati
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi magic ne basapa kaa sabase adhik nuksaan kiya tha
 The SP managed to win 5 and the Congress 2 seats, but the bsp's account was not even open
 ab vidhansabha chunaav main bhi yahi haal he
 The second season on the last day of Sahitya Aaj Tak, 2017 was screened by screenwriter, lyricist and creative producer Jaideep Sahni, writer Mayank Tiwari and writer and director Syed Ahmed Afzal
 inhone sahitya, cinema or bazaar vishay par apane vichaar rakhe
 Jaideep Sahni said, Cinema is a medium, from that you can make a wedding video, or an art film or a blue film
 median ko nahin pataa ki aap kya bananaa chaahate hai
 As far as the market is concerned, it does not cost much to make a painting or write a novel, it is in cinema
 cinema main ham ek duniya basaate hai, jisane main karodon rupye kharch hota he
 Our body will never be left out of the market
 bazaar kii sawari karnaa sher kii sawari karne jaisaa he
 We are looking for a middle ground: Mayank Tiwari said on this topic, Mayank Tiwari said, in literature also the market is the same as in cinema
 aap chaahate hai ki aapaki kitaab yaa kavita bike, phir chaahe vah paanch sau kii ho yaa paanch rupye kii
 This is the awareness when writing how the reader will react
 ham bich kaa rasta khoj rahe hai, jaise maine newton likhi use saraahna bhi mili or produsar bhi mili
 Syed Ahmad Afzal said, when we go out to make cinema, a lot of responsibility comes
 usamen se ek jimmedaari yah bhi he ki aap produsar kaa paisa waapas nikaalkar use den
 It is necessary to find a balance of this
 sahitya or produsar donon kaa khyaal rakhana padhata he
 There may be many views of literature, but cinema has only one view
 seshan ko aage badhaate hue bich kaa rasta nikaalane ke sawaal par jayadeep saahani ne kaha, ek hota he ki ham apane liye likhte hai, yadi ham apane liye na likhen to usamen aatma nahin hoti
 Second, we write for audiences, they are spending their time and money
 unke time kii kadra karnaa jaruri he
 Whose thing is to judge from the subject
 jaise hamane apni film shuddh desi romance kareeb 84 logon ko dikhaai, jinamein 75 logon ne kaha ki mat relies karo, ashleel he
 But it was heard ten days before the release
 is main dedh sau logon ne apane dedh saal lagaae the
 Sahni further said, we are storytellers and our job is to extract and tell stories of our society
 ab samaaj main dilli kaa middle class bhi ho saktaa he, athlete bhi or criminal bhi
 Meera Nair has a line, if we don't tell stories then who will tell
 ab yadi samaaj main ladkaa-ladkiyaan saath rah rahe hai to ye jhooth to nahin he, rah rahe hai wo
 Story work is not to judge
 hamaara kaam he logon kii aawaaj bananaa
 Padmavati controversy: Do not tamper with the original text, Mayank Tiwari said on the question of tampering with the hohistorical story, asked such stories should be tampered with, but there is a context in which you have to search for fiction
 newton main hamane aisa hi kiya
 The story of the film is like a dream, this dream should not be broken
 ye jari rahanaa chahie
 In the context of Padmavati, Syed Ahmed Afzal said, the special thing in Padmavati is that its backdrop should be shown in a transparent way
 kairactors main original text kaa khyaal rakhana chahie
 It should not be manipulated
 kahani ke taur par drama ho saktaa he
 But original things should be more and more
 april kii 22 taarikh ko bihar ke aurangabad jile main daudanagar thane ke taraar gaanv main jab damakal jataa ram ke ghar main lagi aag bujhane ai to usamen pani hi nahin tha

 The deal with BP has already cost Mukesh Ambani Rs 31,000 crore
 kii nakad puunji ke vishaal bhandar ko doguna kar degaa
 This will put more pressure on them to invest this cash and benefit their shareholders
 vishleshanon ke mutabik, agle 12 maheenon main reliance ke paas 25 arab dollar kii nakadi hogi
 But there is no clear indication of how Mukesh will invest this huge amount
 ateet main mukesh kah chuke hai ki ve nae kaarobaar khojane kii apane pita kii hi nitiyon kaa anusaran karenge, jisamen unki nakadi kapanch guna hissaa khapega taaki vruddhi kii tej gati ke saath talmail banaae rakhaa ja sake
 But this is unlikely
 unke do kaarobaar -doorsanchaar or khudara- jinamein mukesh kii kaaphi nakadi pehle khapai ja chuki he, ab apekshaakrit kam laagat vaale ho gaye hai
 Last year, Ambani bought an all India license to launch 4G broadband service
 ambani ke sahyogi manoj modi ne maujuuda doorsanchaar tower suvidhaon se sevaayen shuru karne ke liye ek kam laagat vaali tarkeeb nikaal lee he

 ''reliance ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai ki videsh main bade adhigrahan kii hameshaa sambhaavna rahati he
 Reliance has been continuously trying to acquire raw materials and technology outside India

 pichley do varshon main reliance urja kaa ek aakarshak strot samajhi jane vaali america kii shell gas sampatti ko hasil karne main kareeb 3

 It is expected that the way Reliance entered the retail market before liberalization, its next goal would be to get a full banking license
 desh kaa buniyadi dhaancha nirmit karne ke liye 500 arab dollar se zyada kii jarurat he, ise dekhte hue mukesh is kshetra main nakadi laga sakate hai
 Some early evidence of this can already be seen
 mana ja rahaa he ki ariel buniyadi suvidhaayen viksit karne vaali or vitt muhaiyaa karne vaali infrastracchar lijing and finance company (iel and ennes) main japan ke orics corporation se uski 23
 1 to 87 percent share
 2 arab dollar main kharidne ke liye baatcheet kar rahi he
 If the deal goes through, RIL will become the second largest investment company in IL&FS after Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and with it it will step into the financial services sector
 vyapaar ke ek akhbaar ne haal hi main khabar di thi ki is baatcheet main modi ariel team ke mukhiya honge or orics kii ore se uske upaadhyaksh eukiyo yanase aguai karenge, jo reliance ke bade adhikariyon se baat karne ke liye haal hi main bharat aae the
 Interestingly, in the late 1980s, IL&FS, set up by Central Bank of India, HDFC and erstwhile Unit Trust of India to develop infrastructure and provide financial services, had a prestigious $ 100 billion delhi-mumbai Industrial The corridor project has a 41 percent stake

 It operates India's largest private equity company worth $ 3 billion and has acquired Maytas Infrastructure (now IL&FS Engineering) and Maytas Properties, promoted by Ramalinga Raju through court orders
 baharhaal kuch logon kaa tark he ki akele urja kaa kaarobaar reliance kii sari nakadi ko gatak jayega
 In this way the deal with BP is of great importance
 ab tak reliance ne iske sirf ek block di6 kii khudaai kii he or gas nikaalane ke liye buniyadi dhaancha taiyaar kiya he
 The company has to spend $ 7 billion in doing so
 is hisaab se agar bache hue 23 block par itnaa hi paisa nivesh karnaa padaa to beepi se saude ke baad kharch ke 70 pratishat hisse kaa matlab yah hoga ki in blokon ko viksit karne par hi reliance ko 115 arab dollar kharch karne honge
 Says a senior Reliance official, "given the risk and uncertainty associated with the drilling of gas wells, you can infer that these investments will last a long period, ie around 10 years
" ''ooncha daanv laga hone se aashcharya nahin ki reliance ne vaishvik urja kshetra main kahin adhik badi or taqatvar company ke saath badi saajhedaari karne kaa faisla kiya
 Earlier, Reliance had decided to go deep into deep sea digging
 lekin di6 main gas ke pravaah main lage jhatkon ne vishleshkon ko chintaa main daal diya tha
 Since the boom in 2007, with the continued decline in profits in the oil refining business, experts expected gas to turn profitable
 pichley 12 maheenon main reliance kii share keemat 1,150 ru
 Fell from 977 to Rs
 par pahunch gai
 After the announcement of the deal with BP, analysts like Bank of America's Merrill Lynch's Vidyadhar Ginde and ubs's Prakash Joshi and Ruchi Patwari suggested buying Reliance shares
 philhal, palada mukesh kii hi ore jhukaa dikhataa he
 In the 2011 annual Global Energy Assessment, BP estimated that India's energy consumption would increase by 115 percent over the next 20 years, and gas is the fastest growing fossil fuel
 2025 tak bharat main gas kii kul khapat pratidin 12
 It is estimated to reach 5 billion cubic feet while it is currently 5

 Reliance produces 40 percent of the country's total production and 30 percent of its consumption

 The wheel of Modi's political career revolved last week when he set a day-long fast in Godhra
 sthaneey hinduon ke saath yahaan muslimon ko bhi baari sankhya main 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas' naaraa lagaate dekha gaya
 a decade ago there was a turning point in Modi's political fortunes

 He has also instilled a sense of pride in being a Gujarati in Muslim society through his development works
 ab muslim 2002 ko bhula chuke hai
 "those who are accused of burning the Sabarmati Express in 2002, 33-year-old Musa Abdullah Teeth of the same Ghanchi community says," When Modi is taking Gujarat to new heights of development without discrimination, it becomes our duty
 That we support Modi's commendable effort
 ''modi ne rajya ke 25 main se 20 jilon main kareeb chaar lakh logon se ab tak haath milakar shaayad apane hi tareeke kaa ek vishwa record kaayam kar liya ho
 Political analyst Vidyut Thakar believes that "his goodwill mission is a new political model of communicating with people in India's politics
" jo rath yatra ke model se bhi zyada asardaar sabit ho saktaa he kyonki haath milaanaa ek sthaayee judaav paidaa karata he
 "modi started this experiment from Ahmedabad in October last year when the Supreme Court ruling came that he will no longer listen to any complaints and will not interfere in the 2002 Gujarat riots case
" modi kehete hai, ''saath saal se ham dekh rahe hai ki vikaas vot bank kii raajnneeti se prabhavit hota rahaa he
 In this round, development money was increased in those areas where there were more votes
 main asmaan vikaas kii is vajah ko khatm karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 However, in October, Modi refused to wear a Muslim cap given by a cleric

 In June, Siddaramaiah is believed to have changed his car after seeing a black crow sitting on the bonnet of his car
 aisa andhvishwaas he ki kaala kaua anisht kaa pratik hota he
 Let us tell you that Siddaramaiah has in the past called himself a staunch opponent of superstition-fraud
 siddharmaiya ne 2013 main karnataka ke mukhyamantri kii shapath satya ke naam par lee thi, ishwar ke naam par nahin
 Siddaramaiah has been insisting on passing the anti-superstition bill in Karnataka Assembly
 haalanki vipaksh iske khilaaf tha
 Now this opposition has got a chance to speak with Siddaramaiah walking in lemon hands
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki isse sabit hota he ki siddharmaiya ke dohare maandand hai
 Sources say that in July this year, Siddaramaiah was shattered by the accidental death of his son Rakesh Siddaramaiah
 39 saal kaa rakesh europe ke daure par the ki unhenbelgium main aspataalmen bhartee karana padaa tha
 His condition became so bad due to pancreatic disease that doctors could not save him
 baharhaal, kaaran koi bhi ho siddharmaiya kaa neembu haath main lekar ghoomana sabhi ko hairaan kar dene vaala tha
 Could not know who gave the lemon to Siddaramaiah? gujarat main or rajasthan ke thanagaji main jo hua he vah behad sharmnaak he

 The investigative report into the death of Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died after an abortion was denied in Ireland last year, says her investigation could have survived if hospitalists had 'more emphasis' on saving the fetus and on her declining health
 'less emphasis' wouldn't have been given

 Savita, who hails from Karnataka, died on October 28 of poisoning in the blood
 doctoron ne uske 17 hafte ke garbh ko hataane se inkaar kar diya or kaha ki unke bhrun main dhadkan abhi bhi maujuud he or ‘‘ yah ek cathelic desh he

 It does not answer the question of why the urge for abortion was not accepted despite her being ill and in danger of her life

 unki haalat or gir gai or iske baad bhi is par samuchit kuch bhi nahin kiya gaya
 The Irish Times, citing the draft Tuesday's investigative report, said the investigative team believed that there was an over-emphasis on not interfering until the fetal heart stopped working and together with the mother There was very little emphasis on risk of infection and surveillance
 karnataka kii rahane vaali savita kii 28 aktubar ko khun main jehar failane se maut ho gai
 Doctors refused to remove her 17-week-old gestation, saying that the pulsation still exists in her fetus and that "it is a Catholic country

 This gives 1 to every farmer

 The Chief Minister still insists that this lapse cannot be called a scam
 unhone kaha, ''kai kisaanon ke paas aadhaar number nahin hai or bainkon ne form bharte samay aadhaar number kii jagah bas '123' likh diya, kyonki agar kuch nahin bharte to online system main form riject ho jaataa
 "NCP and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna have alleged that this confusion is spread by outsourcing the filling of online forms

 nai dilli: dilli kii ek shaam elahabaad kii upanyaaskaar anitha gopesh ke upanyaas 'kunj gali nahin sonkari' ke naam rahi
 Organized by Rajkamal Publications and Oxford Book Store, the discussion was attended by noted novelist Mamta Kalia, senior critic Rohini Aggarwal and writer Anita Gopesh
 kaarykram kaa sanchaalan suparichit samalochak om nishchal ne kiya
 At the beginning of the program, Suman Parmar, an official of Rajkamal Publications, welcomed all the stage writers and the present literature
 dow om nishchal ne sanchaalan karte hue upanyaas kii kathavstu ke bare main vistaar se bataaya
 He said that 'kunj Galli Nahin Sankari' reflects Kabir's conclusion, which says: Prem Gali Ati Sankari Junki Jaan Kaham
 sanyogvash is upanyaas main dhokhe se apane rugn mamere bhai brajabhaan kii shaadi ke liye surajbhaan ladki ko dekhne khud jate hai tathaa unhen hi var ke rup main dekh kar shaadi tay ho jaati he
 But at the time of seven rounds, when the real groom Brajbhan comes in front, all the family members of the girl express their anger and protest
 par saat phere to pad chuke hai
 Hence, Kalyani's in-laws come to the home of tuberculosis-affected Brajbhan
 jis rup saundarya ke kaaran usne surajbhaan ko man hi man varan kar liya tha, yahaan iskaa ulta tha tathaa ek rugn vyakti ke saath jivan bitaana tha
 Kalyani had a lot of anger and anger towards this deception of Surajbhan for a long time
 iske baavjood dhire-dhire raahen samtal huin
 She finally forgives Surajbhan, who is suffering from guilt, and the love of Surajbhan, who was widowed in a few days, is not hidden towards Kalyani
 ab yaa to kalyani pativrata kaa parichay dete hue is anamel vivaah ko sweekaar kar apni ichchhaaon kii bali de de yaa phir apane jivan kii bachi-khuchi abhilaashaaon ke saath jeene kii ore kadam badaye
 Knowing that love does not remain hidden, she accepts the apology as her lover due to the changed conscience of Surajbhan and the circumstances are so favorable that they both coincidentally one day when Brajbhan goes to Bhawali Sanatorium Come closer and all the inhibitors of the mind get swept away
 sara avsaad aansuon main bah kar chitt ko nirmal svachh kar detaa he
 Even after coming from Bhawali, Surajbhan gets devoted to Kalyani at every turn of life
 surajbhaan ke do betiyaan hai, kalyani ko do bete va ek beti
 Surajbhan's wife has passed away
 brajabhaan ke bade bete basant kii shaadi ho, beti ratna kii shaadi ho, gulab kothi bageeche vaale makaan main rihaaish kaa intjaam ho, surajbhaan har mode par chaakchauband sahaayta ko hajir milte hai
 The love which he could not get from his divinity wife and the untimely leave that left him is the love he gets from Brajbhan's wife Kalyani
 kuch dinon baad brajabhaan kaa beemaari se nidhan ho jaataa he to yah naikaty or sahaj ho uthta he
 Kalyani also wants Surajbhan in his heart, ignoring the fear of Lokapavad, and he also has children with his connections, who are shocked when they meet Surajbhan
 kuch antaraal ke baad surajbhaan kii bhi cancer se mrityu ho jaati he
 In such a situation, when it comes to the last rites of Surajbhan, the same society that scoffs at Shivam seems to be worthy of him only because in the eyes of the people he is the son of Surajbhan
 sara gopan rahasy khul jane ke baad vah bade bete basant ke saamne gunahagaar kii tarah khadi maafee maang rahi hoti he ki vah saare aaropon kii dhajjiyaan udaata hua maa ke paksh main aa khadaa hota he
 He tells the family, citing his mother's struggles, "what amma amma
" chachaa ji ke prati tumhaara sneh dekha he maine
 There was nothing wrong with that
 '' or sabko sunaate hue kahata he: '' baccha nahin hoon main
 Know today sari duniya ek ho jaae tum par ungali uthaane ke liye, par tumhaara betaa hameshaa tumhaare saath rahegaa
 Apart from this result of his love for Kalyani, what else was needed
 is kathavstu ke khulaase ke baad om nishchal ne mamata kaaliya se is upanyaas ke bare main raay janani chaahi
 Having read the first draft of the novel and convinced by Anita's story, Mamta Kalia said that novels or stories are chocked with intellectualism today
 kai upanyaas to neend kii goli kii tarah sula dete hai par yah upanyaas ek saans main padhaa ja saktaa he
 He said that it is not necessary that only a person who knows Hindi can write a story
 anitha gopesh jaisi vigyaan kii vidhyaarthee evam julogy kii adhyapika bhi likh sakati he, yah upanyaas isaki gavaahi detaa he
 Anita has portrayed Kalyani as a strong woman under adverse circumstances and shown her vengeance for her love by breaking the stereotypes of folklore
 yahaan banaras kii penchdaar galiyaan hai
 He has seen the smallness of older men in his life and the nobility of younger men
 uske likhane kii raftaar dhimi he par yah uski visheshta he
 This novel is written in the rebellion of Prem Gali Ati Sankari
 vah yah jataati hai ki bemail vivaah ho jane ke baad stri kii icchhaaen mar nahin jaatin
 How long could she fall in love with an ineligible person
 aisa nahin ki kisi ayogy ke palle baandh di jaae stri to vah sara jivan uske saath kaat de
 She is a woman of changing times
 yah upanyaas simaaon main rahete hue paariwarikta main rahete hue apni rudhiyon se vidroh kaa upanyaas he
 It is the story of an independent woman
 mashhoor katha-lochak rohinee agarwal ne ise ek laghu upanyaas ke baavjood behad rochak upanyaas bataate hue kaha ki jahaan aajkal kissagoi ke marfat vichaar ko thopane kii hode chal rahi he
 Here, despite being the biggest question of the world, this is a story of encounter with a woman destiny without any formula
 yah kahani jivan ko patan ke dhalaan kii ore nahin, aaroh kii taraf le jaati he
 The sacrament is alive within the Kalyani
 baavjood iske vah naitikta ke aadambar ko pare dhakelte hue striyon ke liye role model banati he
 He said that Anita Gopesh has portrayed him very sparingly, despite being on the same bed in the coincidence of Bhawali, in the same bed
 kalyani jaanati he apane gunaah ke liye surajbhaan bhi utana hi kshubdh he
 But gradually Surajbhan's villainy turns into heroism
 uski tamsik pravritiyaan nasht hoti hai tathaa vah behatar manushya main dhalataa he
 He becomes a connoisseur of Kalyani
 aparichay kii diwaar pighalati he
 Mistreatment of mind ends
 rohinee agarwal kalyani ke kirdaar ko larger dain life maanati hai
 She commends Anita Gopesh for the fact that she adorned Surajbhan as a person who is enthralled by her own weaknesses, which is likely to grow
 unhone kaha ki is upanyaas main naatak jaisi ravaanagi he
 Rohini Aggarwal said that this novel smells of spatiality
 isamen galiyaan bahut hai jinke liye banaras janaa jaataa he, rochak romaanchak! unhone kaha ki yah upanyaas pitrusatta se bahut maheen dhang se takaraata hua chalata he
 At the beginning of the discussion, Anita Gopesh discussed the contents of the novel and recalled the past literary atmosphere of Allahabad
 unhone kaha ki unhone elahabaad ke saahitiyik paridrishy ko apane pita gopikrushna gopesh kii saahitiyik parvarish ke bich bahut gaur se dekha suna va janaa he
 Such stories are embedded within them, through which the literary environment passed can be understood
 gyatavya he ki prayag main 1954 main janmi anitha gopesh elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main praani vigyaan kii vibhaagadhyaksh hai
 She has written many stories and word pictures for AIR and Doordarshan
 unhone kai naatakon main abhinay kiya he jinamein tughlaq va ghasiram kotwaal pramukh hai
 She is currently the chairperson of the 'parallel' Natya Sanstha
 isse purv bhartiya gyanpith se unka ek kahani sangrah prakashit ho chukaa he

 Arvind Kejriwal has now also been accused of violating the right to information
 ye aarope kejariwal ke hi purv sahyogi rakesh agarwal ne sabooton ke dastavej ke saath lagaae hai
 Rakesh Aggarwal said in a press conference that in the last four months 13 questions were asked to Kejriwal's party and not a single answer came
 vidhansabha chunaav tak arvind kejariwal ke chahete rahe nyaybhumi sanstha ke sarvesarva rakesh agarwal ne aam aadmi party ke chunaav prachaar kii ruparekha taiyaar kii thi
 Aggarwal has now accused Kejriwal of turning away from his principles
 unka kahana he ki kahaan to arvind kejariwal kabhi soochna ke adhikaar ke nayak hua karte the or kahaan ab unki hi party is adhikaar ko datta bataa rahi he
 In the last four months, Kejriwal has been asked 13 questions and received no response
 in 13 sawaalon main aakhir aisa kya tha ki arvind kejariwal kii party jawaab nahin de pai?party kii kul aamadani or kharche ko lekar sawaal: ye poocha gaya ki deshbhar se party kitna chanda ikattha kar rahi he or ise kaise kharch kiya ja rahaa he?lokapal ko lekar sawaal: poocha gaya ki aakhir kyon aam aadmi party kaa lokapal alag he?mukhyamantri rahete hue jab arvind kejariwal se parivahan sachiv ke transfar kii vajah poochi gayi to jawaab mila ki transfar ke kaarnon ke bare main maaloom karnaa unke soochna ke adhikaar ke daayre main nahin aata
 Then it was asked what criteria the party is adopting for the selection of candidates in the elections, it was also not answered
 nyaybhumi sanstha ke sachiv rakesh agarwal kaa kahana ki artiai par aam aadmi party kaa ye stand arvind kejariwal kii kathani or kerani kaa antar spasht karata he
 Rakesh also said that in the 49-day government tenure of the Aam Aadmi Party, the lack of answers to questions under RTI proves that the tenure of Arvind Kejriwal as Chief Minister was not efficient in this matter

 england ke khilaaf pune main mili shandaar jeet par NDTV se baatcheet karte hue purv test captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki ye ek shandaar jeet he
 It is okay to use a great word for this
 jeet is vajah se khaas he, kyonki shuruyaat main bharat ne jaldi-jaldi apane 4 wicket ganvaa die or uske baad ek special saajhedaari ne bharat ko jeet dilaai, jisamen team ke yuva khilaadiyon ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai, lekin iske saath hi gavaskar ne gendbaazon ke bachaav main kaha ki pich gendbaazon ke lihaaz se zyada acchhee nahin thi
 It was a flat pitch on which the batsman could play shots standing and batting was not very difficult
 viraat kohli par baat karte hue gavaskar ne kaha ki viraat ek shandaar ballebaaz hai or unhone is pari ke dauraan jis tarah ke shots khele unke bare main sochna bhi mushkil he
 The shot he played for his century and hit a six, then the way he played a shot and hit a six with a straight ball was just amazing, but the best thing was for Indian cricket and for the fans
 It is that Virat will play for 10 more years
 tippaniyan Regarding Kedar Jadhav, Sunil Gavaskar said that he is a special batsman, whom he has been giving a glimpse of, but this time he played a special innings in front of his family in his home ground and told that he has the ability to play long innings
 unhone bhale hi kam gend khelkar shatak laga diya ho, lekin wo viraat ke saath saajhedaari main the or unhone tej ran banaae or viraat ke saath ran bananaa aasaan nahin
 Stretching muscles is common after a century, but he is a special player
 number 6 par aakar is tarah kii pari vaaki khaas he
 Regarding Hardik Pandaya, Gavaskar said that Hardik proved to be effective for India at every end and he is fulfilling the role of all-rounder for India

 kedaar jadhav ko lekar sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki wo ek special ballebaaz hai, jisaki wo jhalak dete rahe hai, lekin is baar unhone apane home ground main apane parivaar ke saamne ek khaas pari khelkar bataa diya ki unamem lambii pari khilne kii kshamta he
 He may have scored a century by playing a low ball, but he was in partnership with Virat and he scored fast and it was not easy to score with Virat
 shatak ke baad mansapenshiyon main khinchaav hona aam baat he, lekin vah ek special khilaadi he
 This kind of innings coming at number 6 is really special
 hardik pandya ko lekar gavaskar ne kaha ki hardik har chor par bharat ke liye kargar sabit hue or vah bharat ke liye olerounder kii bhoomika par khare utar rahe hai
 Regarding Hardik Pandaya, Gavaskar said that Hardik proved to be effective for India at every end and he is fulfilling the role of all-rounder for India
 janata dal united notebandi ke virodh main kisi dharna, pradarshan main bhaag nahin legi
 The party has decided to stay away from 'bharat Bandh' and outrage march on Monday
 yah faisla shanivaar kii shaam ko patna main nitish kumaar kii adhyakshata main yojit party kii kor cameti kii baithak ke baad liye gaya
 The party's Bihar unit president Vashisht Narayan Singh said that Nitish Kumar has also informed his decision to Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Yadav and Bihar Congress president Ashok Chaudhary
 nitish kaa tark he ki party pehle notebandi kaa samarthan kar chuki he or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is abhiyaan main benami sampatti ke khilaaf bhi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat chaahati he
 After this, taking part in the sit-in demonstration does not matter
 haalanki party abhi tak sansad or uske baahar is mudde par congress kii aguwai main har kaarykram main bhaag leti rahi, lekin yah ghoshnaa party ke purv adhyaksh sharad yadav liye bhi sandesh mana ja rahaa he jinhone na sirf rajyasabha main nitish kumaar kii line se alag hatakar modi sarkaar kii jamkar aalochana kii thi balki sanyukt sansadeey samiti banane kii bhi maang kii thi
 Nitish was not happy with Sharad Yadav's visit to Mamta Banerjee's dharna at Jantar Mantar
 mana ja rahaa he ki sharad yadav ab is mudde par sabhi kaaryakramon se khud ko alag rakhenge
 Nitish's call to the President of Bihar Congress is being interpreted as meaning that Congress leaders, especially Ghulam Nabi Azad and Rahul Gandhi, who were expecting Nitish's aggressive stance on the issue, are unable to fulfill Nitish at present
 
 haalanki nitish ne shuukravaar ko mahagathbandhan ke vidhayak dal kii baithak main saaf kar diya tha ki rashtriya mudde par teenon dal alag-alag stand le sakate hai
 This grand alliance is for Bihar
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, the party has made it clear that Nitish or his party members will not participate in the proposed sit-in on November 30 in West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's Patna
 party ke rashtriya mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ke anusaar yah dharna patna main yojit karne kaa koi auchity nahin he
 Secondly, suspended MP from Rashtriya Janata Dal, Pappu Yadav will sit with Mamata Banerjee in this protest
 tyaagi kaa kahana he ki pappu jaise bahubali chhavi ke logon ke saath raajnneeti main parhez rakhaa jaataa hai na ki unke saath raajnneeti kii jaati he
 The Janata Dal United believes that Mamata Banerjee should have confined her hold to the BJP ruled states or the states of her allies
 nitish ke har dharna yaa virodh ke kaarykram se khud ko alag rakhane kii ghoshnaa ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki congress or anya bhaajapa virdohi dalon se unki rashtriya raajnneeti main duuri badhegi or nitish par ek gaiyr vishwasi rajaneta kii muhar lagegi
 RJD leaders claim that Nitish is looking for an excuse to return home to the BJP and demonetisation has allowed the distance to turn into friendship
 yah faisla shanivaar kii shaam ko patna main nitish kumaar kii adhyakshata main yojit party kii kor cameti kii baithak ke baad liye gaya
 The party's Bihar unit president Vashisht Narayan Singh said that Nitish Kumar has also informed his decision to Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Yadav and Bihar Congress president Ashok Chaudhary
 nitish kaa tark he ki party pehle notebandi kaa samarthan kar chuki he or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is abhiyaan main benami sampatti ke khilaaf bhi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat chaahati he
 After this, taking part in the sit-in demonstration does not matter

 Nitish was not happy with Sharad Yadav's visit to Mamta Banerjee's dharna at Jantar Mantar
 mana ja rahaa he ki sharad yadav ab is mudde par sabhi kaaryakramon se khud ko alag rakhenge
 Nitish's call to the President of Bihar Congress is being interpreted as meaning that Congress leaders, especially Ghulam Nabi Azad and Rahul Gandhi, who were expecting Nitish's aggressive stance on the issue, are unable to fulfill Nitish at present
 
 haalanki nitish ne shuukravaar ko mahagathbandhan ke vidhayak dal kii baithak main saaf kar diya tha ki rashtriya mudde par teenon dal alag-alag stand le sakate hai
 This grand alliance is for Bihar
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, the party has made it clear that Nitish or his party members will not participate in the proposed sit-in on November 30 in West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's Patna
 party ke rashtriya mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ke anusaar yah dharna patna main yojit karne kaa koi auchity nahin he
 Secondly, suspended MP from Rashtriya Janata Dal, Pappu Yadav will sit with Mamata Banerjee in this protest
 tyaagi kaa kahana he ki pappu jaise bahubali chhavi ke logon ke saath raajnneeti main parhez rakhaa jaataa hai na ki unke saath raajnneeti kii jaati he
 The Janata Dal United believes that Mamata Banerjee should have confined her hold to the BJP ruled states or the states of her allies
 nitish ke har dharna yaa virodh ke kaarykram se khud ko alag rakhane kii ghoshnaa ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki congress or anya bhaajapa virdohi dalon se unki rashtriya raajnneeti main duuri badhegi or nitish par ek gaiyr vishwasi rajaneta kii muhar lagegi
 RJD leaders claim that Nitish is looking for an excuse to return home to the BJP and demonetisation has allowed the distance to turn into friendship

 However, Nitish had made it clear at the meeting of the legislature party of the Grand Alliance on Friday that the three parties can take different stand on the national issue
 yah mahagathbandhan bihar ke liye he
 The comments is bich party ne saaf kar diya he ki trinmul adhyaksh, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke patna main 30 november ko prastaavit dharne main nitish yaa unki party ke log bhaag nahin lenge
 According to the party's national general secretary KC Tyagi, there is no justification for holding this strike in Patna
 duusari baat rashtriya janata dal se nilambit saansad pappu yadav is dharne main mamata banerjee ke saath baithenge
 Tyagi says that people with Bahubali image like Pappu are avoided in politics and not with them
 janata dal united kaa maananaa he ki mamata banerjee ko apana yah dharna bhaajapa shasit rajyon yaa unke sahyogiyon ke rajyon main simit rakhana chahie tha
 After Nitish's announcement to distance himself from every protest or program of protest, it is believed that his distance from Congress and other anti-bjp parties in his national politics will increase and Nitish will be stamped as a non-believer politician
 rajd ke netaaon kaa daawa he ki nitish bhaajapa main ghar vaapasi kaa bahaanaa dhund rahe hai or notebandi ne duuri ko dosti main badalane kaa mauka de diya he
 Meanwhile, the party has made it clear that Nitish or his party members will not participate in the proposed sit-in on November 30 in West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's Patna

 And, if you need to show that two people are getting together, and what they feel for each other, then you need to make them stand in front of each other
 kya aapane kising seen karne se pehle apane pati mohit sahagal se discus kiya tha?is sawaal ke jawaab main sanaaya ne kaha- mujhase pehle mohit ne ek film kii thi, jisamen unhonekising sindiya tha
 So he was the first to discus about it
 unhone mujhase iske bare main baat kii thi
 Mohit did not really want to do the kissing scene
 unhone kaha tha- main yah nahin karnaa chahta or maine riplai main poocha kyon
 i told them baby, we are actors
 agar ye nahin karnaa chaahate hai or aapako koi samasya he to aapako aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 But, if you are thinking anything about me that i am going to have trouble with this, it is not going to happen
 is rishte main koi hipokrasi nahin he, agar koi ek vyakti aisa kar saktaa he, to doosraa bhi kar saktaa he
