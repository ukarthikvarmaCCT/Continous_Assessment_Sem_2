 ' Devendra Satyarthi is a darvesh of folk literature, who traced this continent decades ago in search of folk songs
 lokgeeton main unhen dharti kaa sachcha dard or awaajen sunai padati thim
 At the same time, the true rapture of the Indian people, the joyous celebrations, the customs, the folk traditions, the untold words of raga-vaag and happiness and sorrow, which roamed in thousands of hearts and then secretly of a district or village Folk songs used to echo in the air
 kehane ko ye gaanv kii sidhi-saadi anpadh janata ke geet the, par ve is desh kii mahaan samskruti or hajaaron baras puraani lok paramparaon ke vaahak bhi the, jinase is desh kii koti-koti janata ke man or aatma kaa saakshaatkaar kiya ja saktaa tha
 These folklore of different dialects and language speaking districts and grammars came together to form a common bridge, which without understanding it was impossible to understand the thousands of years old civilization and culture of this great country
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki gandhi ji ne loksadhak devendra satyaarthee ke is kaam ko bhi aazaadee kii ladaai kaa ek hissaa mana or ‘vishaal bharat’ main desh ke alag-alag gramaachalon ke lokgeeton par chhapane vaale satyaarthee ji ke lekhon ko ve bahut raspurvak padhaa karte the
 Not only this, by sending Kaka Kalelkar specially, he called and honored Satyarthi ji at the Congress General Conference
 suprasiddh chintak or bhashavigyaani dow
 Sunitikumar Chatterjee was so moved by the work of the folklore, Devendra Satyarthi, wandering from village to village in search of folk songs, that he was so impressed that he said, "as a reflective and pioneer culture-messenger from Satyarthi to the end
 i will always stand on the background of our languages
 "aise hi, pracheen itihaas or samskruti ke vidwaan vasudevasharan agarwal ne unhen ‘janapadiya bharat kaa sachcha chakravarti’ kaha, "jinke rath kaa pahiyaa apni unchi dhwaja se gramvasini bharatmata kii vandana karata hua sab jagah phir aayaa he
 "I understand, it cannot be told the story of good Alphas Satyarthi's constant journey to dusty feet
 satyaarthee ji ne loakgeet-sangrah kii apni anokhi or shandaar dhun ke kaaran bina kisi sanstha yaa sarkari madad ke, akele apane boote jo kaam kar dikhaaya, vah khud main itnaa bada or kaaljayi he ki sirf usee ke kaaran devendra satyaarthee aadhunik bharat ke sabase bade ‘samskruti-doot’ sabit hote hai
 Mahatma Gandhi understood the importance of this work related to the folk literature of Satyarthi and in repeated letters, he writes that "I read your articles with a lot of juice," written on folk songs of different regions and languages
 " yah ‘ras’ isliye bhi he ki satyaarthee ji jab kisi bhashaa ke lokgeeton par likhte hai to unke shabdon main un lokgeeton kaa-sa saral aaveg khud hi foot padataa he or us aaveg main kisaanon, mazdooron, striyon ke sukh-dukh or ichchhaaon kaa sansar, gaharaa-gaharaa-sa paariwarik ras or humachati fasalon kaa sangeet basaa hota he
 In folklore, Satyarthi listens to the grief and pain of the entire people and says the same in his simple and gentle words
 isiilie unke lok sahitya sambandhi lekhon main vah cheez aati he, jo mahatma gandhi ko bhi apni sari raajnneetik vyasttaaon ke baavjood ras le-lekar padhane ke liye taiyaar karti he
 Perhaps that's why Mahatma Gandhi found Satyarthi's work to be an essential part of the country's freedom struggle
 ve baar-baar is baat ko jor dekar kehete hai ki satyaarthee ji nirantar gaanv-gaanv bhatakkar, lokgeeton ke sangrah ke jariye bharat kii aatma kii jo khoj kar rahe hai, vahi to aazaadee kii ladaai kii buniyadi prerana he
 The entire expression of the vast masses of India, which we talk about, is only in the folklore of different languages
 isiilie congress kaa fijpur adhiveshan hua to gandhi ji ne kaaka kalelkar ko vishesh rup se bhejkar, satyaarthee ji ko is mahadhiveshan main bhaag lene ke liye nyotaa
 There Gandhi and many other representatives openly praised Satyarthi's work
 satyaarthee ji jab angreji raaj main haahaakaar karti janata ke dard par yah loakgeet sunaate hai, "rabb moya, devate bhajj gaye, raaj firangiyaan da
 
 
 ! "gandhiji's comment on this is significant
 ve maano bhaawanaaon main behate hue romanchit hokar kehete hai, "agar taraazoo ke ek palade par mere or jawaharlal ke saare bhaashan rakh die jaaen or duusare par akelaa yah loakgeet, to loakgeet vaala palada hi baari rahegaa
 "when this unique tune of Satyarthi takes him to Shantiniketan through continuous travels, Rabindranath Thakur looks at him and says," i am happy, you are completing the work which i could not do
 " " or tab is alabele, dhuni yaayavar ko pataa chalata he, apni kishoravastha main swayan rabindranath thakur ne ek baiylgaadee par baithkar saare bengal ke bhraman kii yojana banaai thi, taaki gaanv-gaanv jaakar vahaan ke lokgeeton ko jinhen bangla main ‘palli geet’ kehete hai, ikattha kiya ja sake
 This plan of Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur could not be fulfilled, that is why in Satyarthi ji, he seems to realize the dream of completing his incomplete journey
 ve maano gadgad hokar unki diary main likhte hai, "sari duniya ke khanabadosho, mere shabdon main chhod jaao apni gandh!"*or isi daur kaa ek prasang jo mahaamanaa madanamohan malviya se judaa hua he, satyaarthee ji kabhi-kabhi bade sankoch ke saath sunaaya karte the
 It happened that when Satyarthi reached Dehradun while walking, he came to know that Malaviya ji is also staying here
 satyaarthee ji malviya ji se pehle mil chuke the or mahaamanaa unke lokgeeton ke sangrah ke kaam or tadap se parichit the, uske prashansak bhi the
 When Satyarthi went to meet him, Malaviya ji got very happy and met Prem, asked about his works and writings
 satyaarthee ji abhi yah sab bataa hi rahe the ki achaanak mahaamanaa kii najar unke dhul-dhoosarit pairon par padi
 He said, "wait a minute
 "mahaamanaa bheetar gaye or laute to unke haath main ek jodi mojey the
 He asked Satyarthi to wash his feet and then started wearing socks with his hand
 satyaarthee ji behad sankoch se bhar gaye
 Retracting his feet, he said, "oh, Malviya ji, what do you do, i am equal to your son
" "is par mahaamanaa malviya ji kaa jawaab tha, "to kya koi pita apane putr ko moja nahin pahana saktaa? ye pair na jane kahan-kahan bhatakkar aae hai
 If i wear you socks with my hand today, then i will get happiness
 "baad main satyaarthee ji kaa sankoch bhaanpakar unhone apane bete se unhen mojey pehanaane ke liye kaha
 Whenever Satyarthi narrated this episode, his voice used to get wet
 ankhen maano chhalchala uthati thim or ve dhire se kehete the, "us samay yah itnaa bada kaam haath main liya tha to isliye ki itane bade-bado kaa aashirwad mere saath tha
 Had it not been for this, would i have been able to complete my work? Perhaps somewhere in the middle, he would sit tired or broken
 "aaj yah sochakar romaanch hota he ki is dhuni shaks ne bees baras tak bina ruke, bina thake gum-ghumkar bharat ke kone-kone, gaanv-gaanv kii yatra kii he
 And collected about three lakh folk songs of all languages
 vah bhi is haalat main jabaki kahin se koi sahaara nahin tha
 There is no grant or fellowship of any institution and sometimes it was a condition that there was not even four paise in pocket
 kisi ne kiraye ke paise juta die, to aage bad gaye
 Neither the food of tomorrow nor the place to stay
 or yon akele ek vyakti dwaara lokgeeton yaa kisi bhi lokkala ke kshetra main itnaa bada kaam na pehle kabhi hua, na baad main
 Devendra Satyarthi is alone here, his own example
 ramanaresh treepathi ne, jinhone swayan bhi lokgeeton ke kshetra main bada kaam kiya, ek chitthee main satyaarthee ji kii is anokhi dhun ko badi spruha, aadar or bhavukta ke saath yaad kiya he, "gramgiton ke sambandh main jis maarg par chalane kii ichha main varshon se kar rahaa tha, use to aapane naap daalaa
 Blessed are your courage
 aapaki sachhee lagan itihaas kii vastu ho gai he
 i bow to you 
 
 
 You are the first and last in this field
 itnaa parishram koun karegaa!"yaheen ek baat gaur karne kii he
 Satyarthi has been using the word 'folk song' from the beginning for what Ramnaresh Tripathi called 'gramgeet'
 ‘gram’ shabd se unhen kuch aapatti nahin thi, balki ve acchhee tarah jaanate the ki zyaadaatar loakgeet gaanv kii prishthbhumi se upje hai
 But the scope of 'lok' is more and it is the product of a consciousness that does not differentiate between man and man, not even in rural and urban
 shaayad isiilie satyaarthee ji ko ‘loakgeet’ shabd adhik mohataa rahaa or aaj ‘loakgeet’ shabd hi prachlan main he, ‘gramgit’ nahin
 The truth is that not only 'folklore', 'folklore', 'folk literature', 'folk art' and 'lokayan', the great credit for the prevalence in Hindi goes to Satyarthi Ji
 yah digar baat he ki unhone kabhi garvpurvak yah daawa nahin kiya or na aisa karne kii ichha yaa vichaar unke man main aayaa
 He always humbly said that after all, i am giving only what is taken from the public
 isamen meraa apana kya he!yahan tak ki aazaadee se pehle ol india radio ke nideshak ahamed shah bukhari ‘pitaras’ ne satyaarthee ji se apane ikatthe kiye gaye chuninda loakgeet ol india radio ko dene kaa aagrah kiya, jinhen us samay ke behtareen gayakon ke swar main prastut kiya ja sake
 Satyarthi gave a thousand folk songs of different languages to All India Radio
 lekin paarishramik kii baat ai, to satyaarthee ji ne turant pratwaad kiya
 He said, "look, i have gathered these from place to place, but these are the things of the villagers
 unheen kii poonji hai
 The copyright on these is of 'bharatmata'! "and they did not actually take the remuneration of those folk songs
 isse satyaarthee ji kii nirabhimanta hi pataa nahin chalati, unke ant:karan kaa yah drudh vishwaas bhi saamne aata he ki lok sahitya par sabase pehla haq janata kaa he, ‘dhartiputron’ kaa he
 Even educated intellectuals, so-called culture thinkers and professors of universities may do fine-grained explanations of them, but they will remain the things of the villagers
 isi tarah kaa ek prasang 1940 main kii gai satyaarthee ji kii lanka-yatra kaa he
 He stayed in Chennai (then Madras) for a few days before going to Lanka
 unheen dinon ek tamil patr ke sampadak paanch hajaar rupye kaa check lekar aae
 He said in a polite voice, "we keep translating and writing your articles on folk literature, this is its remuneration
 "satyaarthee ji musakaraaye
 Said, "my travel expenses to Lanka have been arranged
 to yah raashi lekar main kya karunga? aap ise anuvadak ko de dijie
 "and in reality the amount was given to the translator
 vah bhi us haalat main jab ki satyaarthee ji kii jeb main chaar aane bhi nahin the
 Yes, a gentleman had taken the responsibility of traveling to Lanka, and Satyarthi was satisfied with this
 ‘lokgeeton kaa fakir badshaah’ satyaarthee ji ko yon hi to nahin kaha gaya!satyaarthee ji ke lok sahitya sambandhi adhyayan kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki jab ve lokgeeton par lekh likhte hai, to unki bhashaa main bharat kii vishaal janata kaa dukh-dard baha chalaa aata he
 The language in which the poor laborer or farmer of India thinks, which is the language of his crying, singing, joy and dreams, the same language starts to descend from the pen of Satyarthi himself
 isiilie jab satyaarthee ji ke ye lekh ‘modern rivyuu’ jaisi antarrashtriya prasiddhi kii patrika main chhapane jate the, to ramanand chatarji kaa sampadakeey vibhaag ko yah aadesh bhi saath hi natthi hota tha ki, "satyaarthee ji dwaara kiye gaye lokgeeton ke anuwaad kaa ek bhi shabd idhar se udhar na kiya jaae or na unhen badla jaae
 Because only Satyarthi ji and his alphabets can open the hearts of folk songs better than anyone else
 "isi tarah pashto lokgeeton par unka jo lekh neuyark se nikalne vaali ‘asia’ patrika main chapa, uski chaturdik charchaa thi
 Dr
 shyamacharan dube sareekhe vidwaan or nritatvashastri to unase behad prabhavit the or baar-baar patr likhakar unke kaam ke mahatva ko chinh rahe the
 He even wanted to write the role of his book 'indian Village' to Satyarthi
 unhone kaaphi aagrah kiya, par satyaarthee ji kaa vinramtapurvak inkaar
 He said that i am not an academic scholar of folk literature
 lihaaja yah kaary kisi or se karavaayen!kitna bada aadmi! apni vinamrata main tamaam academy vidwaanon ke kad se vah bada lagata he
 But like others, he never came to show his work and contribution
 *prabhakar machave ne apane ek lekh main satyaarthee ji ke lok sahitya main yogadan ko badi kritagyata se yaad karte hue likhaa he ki devendra satyaarthee ke lok sahitya ke kaam ne dekhte hi dekhte kaise ek andolan kaa rup le liya
 With the inspiration of 'writers go to villages', many writers of Indian languages left for villages to study and collect folk literature
 gujarati main jhaberchand meghani is kaam main jute the to purvi uttar pradesh main ramanaresh treepathi ne aitihaasik mahatva kaa kaam karke dikhaaya
 But if we look closely, the impact and impression of Satyarthi Ji's work is clearly visible
 isliye ki ve ek baar is kaam main jute to unhone peeche mudakar nahin dekha or unke pair barason baras dhulbhari pagarhndiyon par nirantar chalate hi rahe
 Thus, the search for folk songs of Devendra Satyarthi may have made him a 'history man', but when he left everything and went on a public journey, the matter of fame was secondary
 bas, loakgeet achche lagate the
 Since childhood, they had tasted the taste and taste, so they were eager to collect them
 apane pratham loakgeet-adhyayan ‘dharti gaati he’ kii bhoomika main ve atyant vinat bhav se likhte hai-"aaj sochataa hoon ki kaise is laghu jivan ke bees baras bhartiya lokgeeton se apni jholii bharne main bitaa die to chakit rah jaataa hoon
 There was no special tool
 suvidhaon kaa to kabhi prashn nahin uthaa tha
 Still there was a passion - a tune
 aaj sochakar bhi yah kahana kathin he ki nae-nae sthaan dekhne, nae-nae logon se milane kii dhun adhik thi yaa vastut: loakgeet-sangrah karne kii dhun
 In any case, i made long and continuous trips
 kai janapadon main to main do-do, teen-teen baar gaya
 In these trips i also filled the lack of education
 "satyaarthee ji jis saralata or nirabhimanta se apni kamiyaan kholkar bataa dete hai or apane bheetar jaraa bhi koi gaanth nahin rakhte, usase unke vyaktitv ke aise rahasy kaa pataa chalata he jisane unhen is had tak lokgeeton kaa divaana banaaya
 It was to see life with the eye of the heart and to put poetry into action
 isi cheez ne devendra satyaarthee ko unki is anokhi dhun ke saath-saath ek aisi bhashaa di ki gaanv ke sidhe-sade jan, majdoor, kisaan or striyaan hi nahin, unke loakgeet bhi unke aage aakar ni:sankoch apana hriday kholane lage
 And thus Satyarthi ji and folk songs have some 'batakhi' going on, which does not belong to the great pundits and masters of universities
 prabhakar machave ne jab yah kaha ki "akele satyaarthee ne saikadon sahitya praadhyaapakon se adhik moolyawaan kaam kiya he," to ve satyaarthee ji kii isi taral sanvadena or ardrata kii ore ishaara kar rahe the, jisane unhen vah bhashaa di he ki ve har loakgeet ko uski alag jamini or saanskrithik pahchaan ko hamaari aankhon ke aage le aate hai
 Like in front of this 'lok Yayavar' they have become folk songs 'sadeh'
 yahan satyaarthee ji kii bhashaa kii loch or kalpana-shakti kii jeevantta dekhte hi banati he
 "" Familiar words
 chir-parichit baaten
 The familiar voice - this is the power of folklore
 koi geet pahari pagadendi ke samaan unchaa-nicha, koi samtal pradesh ke dur tak faile hue kshitij kii chhavi liye hue
 Nirav, the melancholy twilight songs have more color, and the night songs
 prayek ritu, prayek utsav, kaatne-bunane ke dhandhe, jutai-buaai or niraai-kataai kii saamaajik kriyaayein- sabhi ke saath taanke lage hue hai
 As the sun rises like corn bread, it becomes evening, the night passes and the wheels of folklore keep on moving with the cycle of time
 "devendra satyaarthee ke liye loakgeet sangrah kaa kaam koi thopa hua kartavya nahin tha
 They were captivated by his attraction since childhood
 striyon or charavaahon ke bich sunne ke liye unka man lalakata tha
 Once, after listening to the folk songs from the shepherds of the village, they had copied them and stole money from the box in return
 baad main yah chori pakadi gai or unhen daant padi
 He scolded this scandal, but the 'accident' that occurred with the folk songs of his choice, which he copied, was shocked
 hua yah ki daant padane ke dar se unhone vah copy apane mitra asasingh ke yahan chipa di thi
 Asasinh himself used to sing folk songs very well and he too had the addiction of listening to the folk songs
 par asasingh jab middle main fail hua, to geeton kii vah copy uske pita kii coup-drushti kaa shikaar ho gai
 That copy was burnt, the boy Satyarthi got this news as if his blood had dried up
 der tak uske munh se koi bol nahin niklaa
 He endured it, but with a new resolve that he would devote his life to this work and show it by doing something new
 lokgeeton ko sammaan dilaakar rahegaa
 This thought did not disappear from his mind even for a moment
 ek baar antarang baatcheet main unhone bataaya bhi tha, "bachapan main arya samaaj ke ek utsav main gaya tha
 At the same time first saw 'geetanjali', bought it and brought it home
 jane kyon man rah-rahakar sawaal kar rahaa tha, ‘gitanjali’ ko nobel puraskaar mil saktaa he to hamaare lokgeeton ko kyon nahin
 Are they in favor of anyone? ”gradually in the world of folklore, Ramtey began to understand, this is really a return to his roots
 bharat kii saanskrithik ekta kii sookshm pahchaan chhipi he in lokgeeton main
 It is impossible to understand India and the people of India without understanding them
 khud satyaarthee ji ne jo loakgeet ekatra kiye, ve bhi samagrata main yahi baat kehete hai
 In Bundeli folklore, putting the mascara in the eyes, wearing a vermilion, wearing a green cloth and wearing earthy clothes is the world-like form of Mother, so in Garhwali songs, there is such a love for her Maleth village that the words begin to speak - how is it o Bhandari , Your maleath? It seems good to see you, my maleath
 
 
 !satyaarthee ji ne itani sahaj bhashaa main is loakgeet kii kavyanuwaad kiya he ki kabhi-kabhi to bhram hone lagata he ki kahin yah koi samakaleen kavita to nahin he
 * There are so many colorful, beautiful and effective folk songs in Satyarthi's store that it is surprising to see
 ek ore unhen mallahon ke geet aakarshith karte hai jinke chappu aaazaad laharon kaa gaanaa gaate hai, to duusari ore charkha-geeton main unhone stri kii aazaadee kaa nayaa bhashya kiya
 Then there are songs of rebellion and freedom struggle
 par inamen mallahon ke geet main sabase adhik gati or unmuktata he-din bhar main kishti chalaata hoontere paniyon par, o iravati!mallaah kaa jivan he apane aap main ek gitatere paniyon par, o iravati!aage iravati kii betiyon ke us saundarya kaa chithran he, jisase jivan main umang or ullas bhar jaataa he or kan-kan thirakane lagata he-sundar kunwariyaan naach rahi hai, jhum rahi hai,teji se, kabhi dhire-dhire
 Where did you learn this dance? Tell, tell, Iravati's daughters! We are peacocks and you are morons, peacocks will be killed and you will cry
 nadi ke is mode par yah naach siikhaa yaa us pahaad parajahan se iravati nikalati he?tumne yah naach kahan siikhaa?bataao, bataao, iravati kii betio!iravati main kishti chalaane vaale mallahon ke in geeton main gajab kaa saundarya-bodh he
 But even then, where the tears and the pangs of poverty of these seafarers hide - our tears have been contained in Iravati, brothers! Iravati is getting so dirty
 or jab garibi hamaare gale ghont degiiravati isi tarah bahati rahegi
 The same thing can be taken with those charkha-songs which spread the spirit of Gandhiji's self-rule like some infamous angels
 ‘bharatmata’ niabandh main satyaarthee ji badi baariki se in charkha-geeton ke saath judi lok samskruti kii padtaal karte hai
 In these charkha-songs, he repeatedly points towards the immense confidence, self-reliance and self-esteem of the Indian woman
 aakhir isi charakhe ke bal par hi to andhra pradesh kii ek swabhimani stri apni saheli se yah kah paa rahi he-pati kaahe ko o narisachamuch pati kaahe ko?charkha sahi-salaamat rahaato main golkunda ko yaheen khinch laaoungi
 Pati kahe ko o nari, truly husband kahe ho! This is the self-reliance of the charkha due to the accolade of the charkha in Punjabi and Rajasthani folk songs, which Satyarthi ji considers as a public revolution
 punjab main charakhe ke saath gaae jane vaale ‘trinjan’ geeton kaa ras bhi ve khub lete hai
 What a woman says to her husband who goes to Pardesh, when she comes close to Satyarthi in a beautiful song, he gets emotional
 vah anokhaa geet he-ek taka teri chakrichaakri ve mahiya,lakh take da meraa suut vikkhiyaan nuun neend kyon naa ai ve?yahan stri-swatantry ke us sapane ko lakshith kiya ja saktaa he jo aaj kisi had tak hamaari aankhon ke aage saakaar ho chukaa he
 Every freedom is incomplete without economic freedom
 or charakhe ne stri ko aarthik swatantraaa hi nahin, bharpoor aatmavishvaas or swabhimaan bhi diya! gandhi ji kaa yah aisa kamaal tha, jise thik se samajha hi nahin gaya
 But this sentiment came in folk songs and there was plenty
 isse bhi adhik bhaavnaatmak ek or loakgeet khoj nikaala satyaarthee ji ne urisa ke kond adivaasiyon kaa, jahaan soot kaatte stri or purush raja-raniyon se kam nahin he-rani soot kaat rahi haior raja vastra bun rahaa hesundar vastra pahanakar
 And in this whole folklore 'O queen
 
 
 o rani, o raja
 
 
 o king's call, as if tilak on the forehead of the common people and puts him on the gold throne of the king-queen
 yah loktantr kii vijay he, jisamen har mehnat karne vaala purush raja he auki har mehnat karne vaali stri rani!yahi nahin, satyaarthee ji ne dheron aise geet bhi khoj nikaale jinamein gulaami kii gahari tisati hui pidaa he or angrej sarkaar ke atyaacharon ke prati gussa or takalif bhi
 There were also no less songs in which Gandhi, Nehru, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Sardar Patel were like greats, and the people who were saddened by the slavery of the British and hoped that they would soon tear the dark darkness of slavery with their miraculous powers
 par isse bhi gahari or sachhee bhaavana thi bhagatsingh ke prati, jo krantikariyon ke sirmaur the or angrej bhi kahin na kahin unase aatankit rahete the
 But there is also a song in which the British do not have the courage to hang Bhagat Singh and in the last moment, there is a tide of patriotic feelings from within Bhagat Singh - wicked pimples, more and more moments of fear, why fear is hanging? Sudha sura should go to heaven and tell Bhandram Rai, and demand from everyone to bring Bhagat Singh to India, why be afraid, hang the throat? That is, o wicked wicked! i am getting late every second
 mere gale main phaansi daalkar ab darataa kyon he? main vir hoon, sidhaa swarg ko jaaounga or dharmraj ko sab gaatha sunaaoonga
 i will return by asking God for one thousand Bhagat Singh
 mere gale main phaansi daalkar ab darataa kyon hai? jab main dobaaraa janm loonga to tumhen yaheen upasthit dekhuungaa
 
 
 
 o bairee! phir tumhen shatruon kii qatari main khadey karke phaansi par latakaaunga
 Why i am afraid now by hanging my neck? My corpse will burn, i will be consumed here
 phir isi dharti par paudhe foot niklenge
 My bones and my blood will all bear fruit
 o bairee! bharat desh to hamaara he
 Why i am afraid now by hanging my neck? You have tortured many
 o dusht! ab tum dushtataa par utar aae ho
 Now London wants to be attacked, like Lanka
 mere gale main phaansi daalkar ab darataa kyon he?isi tarah san 1857 ke viplaviyon kii veerta par ek se ek adbhut loakgeet likhe gaye
 Many songs have a thrilling account of the valor of Veer Kunwar Singh and Rani Laxmibai
 aise hi ek geet main raja benimadhavbaksh singh kii veerta kaa gajab kaa varnan he
 The British are repeatedly writing letters to persuade him to meet with them, on the other hand, his valor and valor has shaken the English army - Raja Bahadur soldier in Awadh, Dhoom Machai More Ram Re! Meet Rana Bhai Re! Jungi Khilat will get me from London; Programming were also several songs that appear
 satyaarthee ji ko aisa hi ek karun gond loakgeet balaghat jile main barasivani se praapt hua
 In this song, the pain of a woman breaking the ballast, as if the stream of tears has flowed and shocked the listener again and again
 satyaarthee ji dwaara kiye gaye is loakgeet kaa anuwaad padhakar lagegaa, jaise ham haal-philhal kii koi kavita pard rahe hon-ang par angiya nahibhukhi-pyaasi main gitti todatii hoon
 
 
 Oh mother, how long do i keep breaking the ballast? i am disgusted by this life
 duniya garam bichhaune par soti he, diwaali kaa jaada pad rahaa he,o maan, thar-thar kaanpati hui main gitti todatii hoon
 We sleep while laying on a bushel in this forest, mountain - we do not sleep in the winter of winter when we tie a four-handed singing; itani musiibat main main gitti todatii hoon, do aana roj miltaa haijivan-bhar mujhe bachche or bacchee kii soch lagi rahegi
 Oh mother, i did not enjoy happiness in my father's house, nor did i get happiness in my in-laws house, o mother, if i had died, it would have been better! The meat is gone, the bones remain
 ji chahta he, jaldi marakar swarg main jaaon or haath jodakar arj karuun,baba, mujhe aadmi kaa janm na dena or koi janm de dena
 Will there be any stone-hearted person whose eyes do not get wet while reading this song? Even the greatest poet of our times can say this ground truth in such touching words, i cannot believe it
 isse lokgeeton kii takat hi nahin, unka dastaveji mahatva bhi saamne aata he
 It is because of the touching echoes of his time and history
 sach puuchhie to behad karun shabdon main kaal kii chaati par likhaa gaya marmaakhyaan he yah loakgeet, jo ek yaadgaar loakgeet bhi he or apane samay kaa itihaas bhi!isi tarah bich-bich main bure vakton kii maar bhi lokgeeton par padati rahi, jisase unamem loakgeet rachane vaali janata ke ansu or karaahen bhi samaa gayi
 That is why today, reading them, the eyes become moist and a compassionate streak is drawn inside
 san 1856 main marwar main jo bhayankar akaal padaa tha, uski kisi dardanaak goonjen is geet main samaa gai hai-chhapaniya kaal re chhapaniya kaal,pher mat aayiyo mhaari marwar main
 Iyo Jamido beats Jeev, kaan te lauon sugar, bhat, gheeva, jaamido? Do not turn your eyes into Marwar
 chhapaniya kaal re chhapaniya kaal,pher mat aayiyo mhaari marwar main
 The method of giving handfuls of food to the hungry people was discovered that the road should be constructed from the hungry people
 yon desh main vikaas kii lambii sadak ban rahi he or bhukhe log use kaise bana rahe hai, uskaa ek chitra dekhen-idu bena aapete dada, idu bena aapete dadadada le vaya, dada le vaya
 Jaru Oubam Peitta Dada, Jarru Oubam Peitta Dadada Dadaya, Dada Leya
 
 
 
 Just listen to the expression of this song in the words of Satyarthi ji
 samaj main aa jayega ki lokgeeton se ek samvedansheel aadmi kii dosti kisi hoti he or loakgeet kaise uske aage apana arth khol dete hai-arthath, yah kisi afat he bhai, yah kisi afat he bhai,o bhai, o bhai!bahut pasinaa niklaa bhai, bahut pasinaa niklaa bhai,o bhai, o bhai!pet main ann nahin bhai, pet main ann nahin bhai, o bhai,o bhai, o bhai!yah kisi afat he bhai, yah kisi afat he bhai,o bhai, o bhai!haathon main chhaale pad gaye bhai, haathon main chhaale pad gai bhai,o bhai, o bhai!sabake haathon main duramat hai bhai, sabake haathon main duramat hai bhai,o bhai, o bhai!jamaadaar ham par naaraaz hota he bhai, jamaadaar ham par naaraaz hota he bhai,o bhai, o bhai!pani chhidqo, pani chhidqo, pani chhidqo bhai,o bhai, o bhai, o bhai!pani chhidqo, pani chhidqo, pani chhidqo bhai,o bhai, o bhai!hamaare desh kii lambii sadak he bhai, hamaare desh kii lambii sadak he bhai,o bhai, o bhai!spasht he ki satyaarthee ji lokgeeton ke koi nirbhaav sangrahakarta nahin rahe ki jo kuch mila, chat jholii main daal liya
 He not only kept the good, meaningful, soulful and blackened folklore apart, but he repeatedly highlighted his power, beauty and characteristics in his writings
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki man kii mouj main aakar shuru kiya gaya loakgeet-sangrah kaa unka kaam swarajya kii ladaai kaa atoot hissaa banataa chalaa gaya
 And following them and taking inspiration from them, such a large convoy of Loksadhakshas stood in the whole country that on seeing this movement of folk literature took place in every province, every section of the country
 desh ke vishvavidhyalay, prabud jan or buddhijivi bhi ab ise gambhirtha se lene lage

 Not only did socialists and literature-admirers like Munshi, Vasudevashran Aggarwal, Shyamacharan Dubey, Verrier Alvin and W

 ji
 Folk critics of international repute like Archer also remembered Satyarthi's work with great respect and mentioned his importance and his unique and difficult practice
 deenabandhu andryus shantiniketan main mili to satyaarthee ji ko banhon main bhar liya
 Said, "I have read your articles on folklore
 aapke kaam ko main bharat kii aazaadee kii ladaai kaa ek hissaa maanata hoon!" isi tarah verrior elvin satyaarthee ke kaam se is kadar prabhavit the ki unhone apane patron or lok sahitya sambandhi pustakon main satyaarthee ji kaa zikr bade sammaan se kiya he
 Gandhiji used to call Satyarthi again and again for intimate talks
 yahan tak ki unhone ke
 M
 munshi se kaha tha ki mumbai main unke nivas kaa jo cameraa sirf mahatma gandhi ke liye riserved rahata he, vah is lokyatri ke liye khol diya jaae
 So that as long as he wants to live there, and while working there, he has no problem
 desh kii aazaadee ke baad satyaarthee ji ne hindi main apane loakgeet-adhyayan kii pehali pustak ‘dharti gaati he’ taiyaar kii, to gandhi ji se uski bhoomika likhane kaa aagrah kiya
 In response, Gandhiji showed great enthusiasm and affection - "leave me a handwritten copy of the 'good Earth' sings
" main iskaa aamukh likhuun, yah tumhaara anurodh he
 It is like asking someone to add a handful of sugar to sweet milk
 isse hameshaa swaad bigadane kaa dar rahata he
 If you are still saying, i will write it
 
 
 
 i have been reading your articles in 'vishal Bharat', 'modern Review' and 'asia' with equal vigor
 bahut-se lekh chhot bhi gaye honge
 You must have been writing four words of a folk song or going on a rough footpath in the village - Meh, whether it is sunny or a storm - i have imagined this many times
 "gandhi ji ne jin patron ‘vishaal bharat’, ‘modern rivyuu’ or ‘asia’ kii charchaa kii he, unamem satyaarthee ji ke loakgeet-sambandhi lekh bade sammaan se chhapate the
 And he suddenly came to the center of discussion
 ‘modern rivyuu’ or ‘asia’ to khayr antarrashtriya prasiddhi kii patrikas thi
 'vishal Bharat' was also popular in Hindi
 pehle banarsidas chaturvedi or phir agyeya ‘vishaal bharat’ main satyaarthee ji ke lekhon ko vishesh rup se aamantrit karke chhapate the
 Agnayya had written a letter to him with great affection and insistence that he wished that the first issue of 'vishal Bharat' should come out in his editing, there should be an article by Satyarthi
 or ‘modern rivyuu’ ke sampadak ramanand chatarji to satyaarthee ji ke vyaktitv kii saral saadagi or unki romaanchak lokyatraaon se prabhavit hokar unhen apana putr maanakar hi prem karne lage the
 On the other hand, the deep affectionate relationship of Gurudev Tagore
 un dinon satyaarthee ji lokgeeton kii khoj main kahin bhi jate, ghoomte-bhatakate aakhir shantiniketan main hi aa tikte
 Shantiniketan was, in a way, the 'halt station' of his travels, where the natural environment and the beauty of the Santhal tribals of the place appealed to his spontaneous nature
 lok sahitya kii khurdari jameen par chalate satyaarthee ji kii bhavakulata unhen jaldi hi srujanaatmak kshetra main ai
 He wrote in almost every genre of story, poetry, novel, essay, sketch, autobiography, memoir-literature and added something new and important to it
 ‘kungposh’, ‘iknni’, ‘nae devtaa’, ‘kabron ke bichombich’, ‘janmabhumi’, ‘ann devtaa’, ‘tikuli kho gai’, ‘nae dhan se pehle’, ‘sadak nahin bandook’, ‘chaay kaa rang’ jaisi satyaarthee ji kii kahaniyon kii khaasi dhooma rahi he
 Because he had such true and pure experiences of his folk journeys, there was such a strange appearance and warmth of life seen from a very close distance that it was as restless to get out of the pen of this folk traveler
 isi tarah satyaarthee ji ke rekhachitron, sansmaranon or yatra-vrittanton main unki ghumkkadi kii aisi dastaanen bikhri padi hai ki manto ne ek baar satyaarthee ji ko patr likhaa ki vah khushiya banakar unke saath gaanv-gaanv, nagari-nagari ghoomana chaahate hai or krishn chander ne to badi lalak se kaha tha, "bhai, apane sukh mujhe bhi de do!"or vaaki satyaarthee ji kii khuli jindagi kii tarah, unke garamjoshi se labarej rekhachitron kaa to kahana hi kya
 Most of the sketches are scattered with documents of his personal life and stories of twirlers
 bhaawanaaon ke us aalodan main nirjeev pathar or nadiyaan bhi bol padati hai
 Whether it is Godavari or Ravi, Satyarthi ji hears the echoes of history and epochs in his speeches
 uske saath unka ajeeb-sa maanviya rishta kaayam ho jaataa he, jiske sahare ve uskaa hriday tatolane lagate hai
 In between, Satyarthi jokes such a dialogue of his happiness and sorrow that a new identity of human existence emerges
 dekha jaae to satyaarthee ji kii aatmakatha yahan bikhri padi he, chappe-chappe par unki chhap he
 Similarly, the taste of Satyarthi Ji's autobiography 'chand-suraj Ke Biran' is unique, in which the folk mind of Punjab is deeply ingrained
 yah digar baat he ki satyaarthee ji kii aatmakatha sari kii sari antarman kii hi kahani he jisamen sab kuch he, magar ganit main duniyavi jodtod or hisaab-kitaab nahin
 Yes, they have a natural thirst for land, they understand it
 dharti ke gaate, chhalchalaate ullas ko unhone janaa or usee ko shabdon main piro diya
 There are very simple, very minor characters in Satyarthi's autobiography
 asasingh, fattu, nura charvaaha, gangi tai, maan ji, bhabhi dhanvanti, pandit ghulluram, master keharsingh
 How many stories of these people were heard from Satyarthi
 par unki aatmakatha ‘chaand-suraj ke beeran’ main unhen ek jivan-dhara main behate dekhne kaa anand hi kuch or he
 There are many historical stories and legends related to Satyarthi's birthplace Bhadaur and a child who got to know the taste of folk songs became something else
 vah nahin rahaa, jo pehle tha
 a strange thirst arose in the inner self which was preparing him for some great wanderings
 lekin in chote-chote paatro, choti-moti, maamuli ghatnaon ke sahare hi satyaarthee ji ne ganne kii mithaas kii tarah mithe katha-ras kii sristi kii he
 And the reason for this is the creative mind which is accustomed to see every event in the form of 'folk-history' taking a new birth
 ek shishu kis tarah parivesh se ras-gandh or sanskaar lekar badhata he
 How his small lingering questions, habits and household rites are telling an interesting story even more than a story, if you want to see it closely, there will be no better book than Satyarthi Ji's 'chand-suraj Ke Biran'
 ek aisi aatmakatha jisamen puraa punjab samaaya he
 When a child who falls on the land of Punjab is young, then he knows how the whole cultural environment, no-no, the earth absorbs the smell of mother, Satyarthi has seen this magic with open eyes
 shaayad isiilie punjab kii jitani gahari, sachhee pahchaan ‘chaand-suraj ke beeran’ main ubhari he, waisi maine kahin or nahin dekhi
 Neither in any autobiography nor in any novel work
 isliye ki likhnaa sirf kalam se nahin hota, uske liye jaisaa khulaa dil chahie, vah to ek alag tarah kii jindagi jeene se miltaa he or use kahin se kharida nahin ja saktaa
 It is no surprise that Satyarthi ji's epic novels such as 'chariot's Wheels', 'puppet', 'brahmaputra', 'doodh-gachh' and 'katha Kaho Urvashi' are in a way an extension of his folk experiences
 Some are written with the heat and truth that Satyarthi ji is as if familiar with the molecules and fibers of the different circles on whose foundation these novels are built
 assam kii andolit jameen par rache gaye ‘brahmaputra’ ko padhate hue lagata he, maano satyaarthee ji janm se hi assam kii lok paramparaon, reeti-rivaajon or jan-samskruti se parichit se hon, to ‘katha kaho urvashi’ padhate samay dhokhaa hota he ki kahin ve sachmuch urisa ke murti shilpiyon ke parivaar ke to nahin hai
 While reading 'doodh-gach', he seems to be native of the land and regions of Kerala
 So reading 'puppetli' and 'teri Kasam Satluj', these novels line by line testify that they cannot exist anywhere other than the land of the typical Punjab
 maano jis jameen or anchal par likhaa, ve man or aatma se vahiin ke ho gaye
 Is this practice of literature and art possible without 'liberation of heart'! For him, the heart, warmth and love of a traveler is plentiful in Satyarthi ji and truth be told, he is also his real treasure
 shaayad isiilie devendra satyaarthee beesvin shatabdi ke un mahakay vyaktitvon main se hai jinke behad vyaktitv or mahakavyatmak anubhavon se bharpoor darjanon rachanaaon se guzarate hue, hamen samoochee beesvin shatabdi ke sahitya, itihaas or ek nai pahchaan ke saath saamne aate maamuli aadmi ko dekhne-samajhane kii ‘nai aankh’ milti he
 Today, when Satyarthi is no more and has given his all to literature and folklore, it is not without saying that some more sincere efforts to understand true and legendary writers like Satyarthi would have been with us! Then the game of meaningless maneuvers and untouched words in the name of literature, which has gone on here, would definitely have got some relief from us

 When asked about the candidature of Anant Singh, an independent MLA from Bahubali and Mokama, the Leader of the Opposition and Chief Ministerial candidate of the Grand Alliance in Bihar said that there is no place for such people in our party
 tejasvi ne shuukravaar ko ranchi ravaanaa hone se pehle patna main patrakaron se baatcheet kii
 He was asked if Anant Singh wanted to contest from Munger seat on the grand alliance ticket
 is par tejasvi kaa jawaab tha ki anant singh ek bed element hai or unako ham party main nahin aane denge
 Tejashwi said that contrary to what our ideology is, he has an ideology, so there is no place for such people in our party
 isse purv anant singh ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve munger seat se endie ke ummidavaar lalan singh ke khilaaf pratyaashee bananaa chaahate hai
 Anant, once considered close to Lalan Singh, is angry with him nowadays
 lekin tejasvi ke bayaan ke baad nishchit rup se anant ke liye nirdaleey pratyaashee banane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 Tejashwi Yadav had earlier also opposed Madappura MP Pappu Yadav from entering the Grand Alliance through the Congress party
 iske baad congress ne unako no entry kaa board dikhaa diya
 However, it is believed that the case of Pappu Yadav or Anant Singh's Tejaswi had known the stand of Lalu Yadav, former RJD president, before making his stand public
 jammu-kashmir kii jammu loksabhaa seat se bhartiya janata party ke jugal kishor ne shandaar jeet hasil kii he

 yah kedarnath agarwal kii ek kavita he
 Even someone who can love nature so much in a dream can only create such a stronghold
 pragatisheel kavy-dhara ke pramukh kavi kedarnath agarwal kaa janm 1 april, 1911 ko uttar pradesh ke banda jile ke kamasin gaanv main hua tha
 He was a poet who engraved nature and humanity
 pita hanuman prasad agarwal swayan ek kavi the
 a poetic compilation by the name of 'madhurim' was also published
 kedaar ji ko kavy-srijan kii prerana parivaar se hi mili thi
 Living in a rural environment, Kedarnath Aggarwal developed an affection for community culture and nature, which was reflected in his poems throughout his life
 gumbaj ke upar baithi he, concil ghar kii maina,sundar sukh kii madhur dhoop he, senk rahi he danna
 He is not disguised as a tapas, he is now the queen, having attained the fruits of renunciation and penance, very attentive in life
 kahata he kedaar suno ji! maina he nirdwandv,satya-ahimsa aadarshon ke, gaati he priy chand
 Kedarnath Aggarwal's collection of poems 'yuga Ganga' was published in March 1947, even before the country became independent
 hindi sahitya ke itihaas ko samajhane ke liye yah sangrah ek bahumoolya dastauez he
 Kedarnath Agarwal was an immortal poet who tasted humanity
 kedarnath agarwal marxvaadi darshan se khaase prabhavit the
 He adopted it in life as well as in creation
 vah kisi bhi tarah ke shoshan ke virdohi the
 Taking communism as the basis of life, he expressed the deep and broad sensations of the life of the masses in his poems
 kavi kedarnath agarwal kii kavitaaon main bharat kii dharti kii sugandh or aasthaa kaa swar miltaa he
 The dew-drop says; Write your mind on the rose-rose kavi kahata he: main bhi likh dunpriy shabdon main man kii baat
 Dew-drops could not be written, something rose and rose
 par kavi ne likh diya os senav-gulab par kavy naveen
 Rituals from home and family in childhood gave him an opportunity to become aware of the struggling life of the poor and the afflicted people
 baad main kanoonee shiksha hasil karte samay unhen is varg ke uddhaar ke upaay keval marxvad main dikhe
 It was here that he became familiar with progressive ideology
 yah unke jivan kaa aatmamanthan kaa daur tha, jisase aage chalakar vah ek samarpit vakil va anuthe kavi bane
 Humanity, man's struggle became the inspirational elements of his poems
 unki 'virangana' sheershak kavita main isaki baangi dekhen
 -I saw him when i saw him, i saw him as i looked, i saw him, i saw him, i saw him, i saw him, i saw him moving
 kedarnath agarwal kii kavy-yatra kaa aarambh saal 1930 se mana ja saktaa he
 He started writing while studying at the University of Allahabad
 prayag ke saahitiyik parivesh se unke gahare rishte kaa andaaza is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unki sabhi mukhya kritiyaan elahabaad ke parimal prakaashan se hi prakashit huin
 The publisher Shivkumar Sahai considered him fatherly and called 'babuji'
 lekhak or prakaashak main aisa gaharaa sambandh aaj milanaa dushkar he
 Since the publication of the poem collection 'phool Nahi Rang Bolte Hai', all the publications of Kedarji were done from Parimal only
 jab tak parimal ke prakaashak ke taur par sivakumar jivit the, kedaar ji kii prayek jayanti par unke nivas sthaan par goshtee or sammaan samaaroh kaa aayojan karte the
 Kedarnath Agarwal fell in love with 'life from here'
 isi sheershak se unki ek kavita kii panktiyaan hai-aise aojise giri ke shring sheesh pararang rup kaa kreet lagayebadal aaye,hans maal maala laharayeor shila tan-kanti-niketan tan ban jaye
 The working people of India are the tangible basis of Kedarnath Agrawal's progress
 marxvaadi darshan ne janata ke prati unki mamata ko pragadh kiya
 He got faith in the struggle of the people and belief in his future
 isiilie kedarnath agarwal apni rachanaaon main shaskaon dwaara janata par hone vaale pashavik daman or janata ke kathin sangharshon ko saamne rakhte
 See the hallmark of it in one of his poems - the leader sold in London, chopped his hands, atlee-bevin - in the British, lost and sold
 bharat-maan kaa put-sipaahi, par ghar main bharamaaya,angrezi samrajyavad kaa, usne dinar udaaya
 He made a deep dive into politics in economics, he lost everything there in democratic India
 'kavita jivan ko udaatt banaati he' maanane vaale kedarnath agarwal ne kavita ke alaava gadhy lekhan bhi kiya

 "khamenei's statement comes after US President Donald Trump's arbitration offer
 trump ne bharat or pakistan ke bich lambey samay se takaraav kaa mudda rahe kashmir kii ‘visphotak' sthiti par ek baar phir madhyasthata kii peshkash kii he
 Trump said he would take up the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the weekend
 america ne modi se kashmir main tanaav kam karne ke liye kadam uthaane kaa anurodh kiya tha
 "kashmir is a very complex place," Trump told reporters

 “kai muddon or vidheyak ke tamaam praavdhaanon par sadasyon ke vichaaron or sujhaavon kii andekhi kii gai he
 
 
 
 isse salect cameti kii puri kavayad hi bekaar ho gai he or yah cameti ko banane ke uddeshy ke hi vipareet he
 " ye baat khan or khanij (sanshodhan) vidheyak kii salect cameti kii report ke saath die gaye visammat patr yani decent note main kahi gai he, jisamen vipakshi partiyon ke saansadon ke hastakshar hai
 However, it is believed that the central government has tied up with several parties to pass the Mines and Minerals (amendment) Bill and it will gather the numbers to pass this bill
 lekin ab bhi kai saansad kah rahe hai ki maujuuda shakl main paas hone par is vidheyak ko adaalat main chunauti di ja sakati he
 The government is proposing to increase the contracts of all existing mines from 30 years to 50 years in this bill
 isse jahaan ek ore khanijon kii nilaamee kii lij badhaane yaa na badhaane ke rajyon ke adhikaar kaa hanan hota he balki sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki kya goa, bellari yaa shah kamishan kii jaanch main fansi companiyon kii maujuuda khadaanon kii lij kaa swat: navinikaran nahin hoga
 The government is saying that by amending the law, it is opening the way to auction, so that it can earn more from minerals like iron ore and bauxite on the lines of coal
 lekin isi vidheyak main praavdhaan he ki jin companiyon ko survey ke liye permit or prospective license diye ja chuke hai vah unheen companiyon ke paas rahengi
 Today most of the known mineral deposits in the country have been given permits and prospecting licenses
 aise main sawaal he ki sarkaar kaa nilaamee kaa daawa kya vaaki kargar sabit hoga, kyonki sarkaar ke paas nilaamee karne ke liye philhal bahut kam khadaanen bachengi
 One of the important questions raised in the meeting of the Select Committee is that at the time of auction, adequate provisions of compliance of laws like Panchayati Raj Act and Pisa with Forest Rights Act are not kept in this law
 sawaal ye he ki kya sarkaar is bare main vidheyak main sanshodhan laaegi
 Most of the minerals in the country are in tribal areas where the importance of these laws increases greatly
 salect cameti main is kanoon par ek sawaal ye bhi uthaaya gaya he ki jin companiyon ko khanan ke theke die jaaen un par munaafe kaa paryaapt hissaa adivaasiyon ke kalyaan or un ilaakon ke vikaas par kharch karne kaa hona chahie
 The bill states that the states have the right to decide who will be in the mineral foundation to be formed in this regard
 jaankaar kehete hai ki kanoon main ye baadhyataa honi chahie ki prabhavit ilaakon ke logon ko is foundation main rakhaa jaae
 It is being said that the government should make one or two amendments in this bill to keep pace with the opposition
 is bare main salect cameti main bahes ke dauraan ye maang bhi uthi janajaatiy kalyaan ke liye paisa sidhe adivaasiyon ke khate main janaa chahie
 But there is also a big question now whether the bill actually makes a condition for companies to spend enough money
 2011 main prastaavit bill main kaha gaya tha companiyon sarkaar ko di jane vaali roylty ke baraabar paisa adivasee or sthaneey logon ke kalyaan ke liye jamaa karengi
 Earlier, the 2010 law had said to spend 26 per cent of the profits, but the bill passed by Lok Sabha limits this expenditure to one third of royalty
 sawaal he ki kya sarkaar is bare main bhi sanshodhan laaegi yaa vipaksh ke sanshodhan ko sweekaar karegi
 Much of the discussion in Tech World these days, from new smartphones and tablets to new Android updates, is more discussed than Microsoft's new avatar 'windows 10'

 Where did 'windows 9' Whenever we talk about 'windows 10', the first question in our mind arises regarding 'windows 9'
 kyonki 'windos 8' or phir apadated 'windos 8
 After 1 ', we are talking directly about' Windows 10 '
 asal main company'windos 8' ke baad sidhe 'windos 10'par kaam kar rahi he
 While this new version of Windows OS can be released in any month of 2015, the company's intention behind skipping 9 is to show that it sees its OS connected to a new and different generation of computing
 kab or kaise milegaa apgrademicrosoft ne abhi tak 'windos 10' kii relies or keemat ko lekar koi ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 However it is believed that it can be launched anytime in mid-2015
 vaise, agar aap chahen to company kii site par jaakar windos insidar program kaa hissaa ban sakate hai
 It updates you from time to time about everything from its preview to price
 desktop, tablet or smartphone'windos 10' kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki yah desktop computing se lekar tablet or smartphone sabhi ke liye ek saath launch kiya jayega
 Its user interface will be same and PC, phone and tablet can be easily connected to each other due to being a Windows device

 If you miss the start menu at 1, then there is good news for you
 company 'windos 10' main ise phir se waapas laa rahi he
 It will remain in its traditional location (bottom left) and will contain all the columns which were in 'windows 7'
 itnaa hi nahin, is baar start menu main 'windos 8' kii tarah live tiles ko bhi jagah di gai he
 The user will also be able to customize these tiles according to their need and preference
 phul screen App mod'windos 10' yujar ko start menu ke saath paramparaagat desktop or 'windos 8' kii tarah phul screen App mod donon istemaal karne kii suvidha detaa he

 nae App kii suvidhacompany windos ke nae varjan kii lonching ke saath hi apane Apps par bhi khub mehnat kar rahi he
 This means that new apps are likely to be released in the Windows App Store
 yahi nahin, samajha ja rahaa he ki company universal App bana rahi he jo desktop se lekar smartphone tak har jagah istemaal kiye ja sakenge
 Task view option 'windows 10' will not only allow the user to arrange the app but it will also have multiple desktop features
 yani agar yujar chaahe to ek desktop par apane App rakhega or duusare par kaam karegaa
 Apart from all this, there will be a task view button option, which will be on the taskbar
 is batan par clic yaa tach karte hi yah aapako chal rahe task, khule hue App, program, file, windos or multiple descop kii jaankaree degaa
 If you want, you can also stop the needless from here
 puraane procesar or windos 10yah bahut sambhav he ki company windos 10 ko 64-bit par aadhaarit rakhe
 In such a situation, if you are planning to buy a new system or device, then take care of this

 10 aatankiyon kii us napak harakat ne 164 logon ke khun se hindustan ke maanchitr par kaala daag chhod diya
 But after 6 years, once again, the same incident kept reaching till the end! The lashkar-e-taiba act then created a shudder in the country, but it is unfortunate that the Mumbai Police has yet to make a dent in the terrorists and this And it has not emerged from its flaws
 yah isliye ki pukhta jaankaree ke baavjood beete dinon '8 aatankiyon' kii toli ne na sirf police ke aath checkpoint ko aasaani se paar kiya, balki getwe of india ke nikat 'bam' bhi plant kar diya
 But thankfully, all this was a mock drill done by the police
 'sagar kavach' main sendhadrasal, beete dinon mumbai police ne 24 ghante kii ek suraksha drill ko murtarup diya
 Its purpose was to highlight the security preparedness and its own flaws, but alas only the flaws emerged
 'sagar kavach' naam ke is oparation ke liye police ne do team banaai, jisamen blue team suraksha jabaki red team aatankiyon kaa gut bana
 The Blue Team has already been told that a group of terrorists may try to enter the city through the sea in the next 24 hours

 yahi nahin, unamem se kuch to getwe of india or kolaba tak bhi pahunch gaye, jahaan 2008 main hamalaa hua tha
 An officer involved in the drill says, 'the Red Force men managed to sneak into the city
 unhone getwe of india ke nikat dami visphotak bhi rakhe
 The Red Force tried to enter the city 30 times, out of which only 22 were able to be recognized and stopped by the Blue Team

 ' While paving the way for the formation of the 29th state of Telangana in India, the much-discussed and controversial bill related to it got the approval of Parliament on Thursday and the Prime Minister assured that the interests of the people of Seemandhra region will be fully protected

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced in the Upper House that the states formed after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh will be given a six-point development package
 simandhra ko vishesh package die jane kii bhi ghoshnaa kii gai
 The Prime Minister intervened to discuss the Bill and said that tax concessions would be provided to promote industrialization and economic development in both the states which were formed after partition

 When the Prime Minister and Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and senior leaders of other parties were speaking in the House, members of the Trinamool were tearing the paper and raising air in the air while raising slogans
 ucch sadan main telugana vidheyak ko paarit karaane main sarkaar ko vishesh kathinaayee kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa kyonki mukhya vipakshi dal ne kisi bhi sanshodhan par mat vibhaajan ke liye jor nahin diya

 haalanki makapa netaa seetaram yechuri tathaa trinmul congress ke kai sadasyon ne is maamle main bhaajapa or congress ke bich 'match phixing' kaa bhi aarope lagaaya

 He said, it was not our intention to divide at the cost of a region or an existing state

 Raising constitutional issues related to the bill, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said that giving the responsibility of law and order in the joint capital of the two new states to the Governor would violate the federal concept of the Constitution
 saath hi simandhra rajya ko hyderabad se hone vaali kar aamadani bhi prabhavit hogi
 Law Minister Kapil Sibal dismissed Jaitley's apprehensions that the government has made suitable provisions in the bill only after taking a comprehensive consideration of all these issues
 unhone kaha ki yadi is vidheyak ko ucchtam nyaayalay main chunauti di jaati he to sheersh nyaayalay ke nirdesh par agali loksabhaa is par faisla kar sakati he or jarurat padane main samvidhan main sanshodhan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Rural Development Minister Ramesh said in clarification of various amendments that the government has adopted the same standards in terms of revenue and other resources sharing and liabilities of the two states which were adopted at the time of formation of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand
 unhone kaha ki polavaram pariyojna mahaj sinchai pariyojna nahin hokar ek bahu-uddeshy pariyojna he
 With this, people of both Telangana and Seemandhra regions will be able to meet various needs including drinking water, irrigation
 isi kaaran sarkaar ne is pariyojna ko rashtriya pariyojna ghoshit kiya he
 Taking part in the discussion on the Bill, Tourism Minister Chiranjeevi opposed the Bill in the current draft and advocated for a focus on both Telangana and Seemandhra regions
 unhone kaha ki is vidheyak par pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke alaava anya netaaon ke saath salaah mashvira nahin kiya gaya
 Criticizing his government on the issue, Chiranjeevi also targeted several parties including BJP, TDP and alleged that double standards were adopted on the Telangana issue
 chiranjeevi ne apane pehle bhaashan main kaha, alag rajya ke mudde par unki vyaktigat raay main koi parivartan nahin hua he lekin vah apni party ke faisle kaa paalan karenge
 He said that he is speaking on behalf of crores of Telugu people of the state and he is not speaking on behalf of any one region

 Earlier, BJP member m Venkaiah Naidu started the discussion saying that he is in favor of creating Telangana, but full attention should also be paid to the development of Seemandhra region

 He said that educational institutes should be established in Seemandhra region like Hyderabad
 unhone roilseema sahit anya pichde kshetron kaa vikaas kiye jane kii bhi maang kii
 Sitaram Yechury of the CPI (M) said that his party has always been opposed to partition
 unhone kaha ki andhra pradesh ke vibhaajan ke liye congress or bhaajapa jimmedaar hai
 He said that this decision of the government will raise the demand for the formation of new states in many places
 unhone kaha ki pichde rajyon ke saath ekasmaan vyavhaar kiya janaa chahie or unke saath bhedbhaav nahin kiya janaa chahie
 BSP leader Mayawati said that her party is in favor of splitting the big states and creating smaller states

 com / f3fnsniqxv— Reem Abdellatif (@reem_abdellatif)july 20, 2016 The last 15 minutes before the landing of Chandrayaan-2 will be very challenging for 14 days and will continue to carry out your scientific work
 Must be listening thodi besabri
 
 
 a little impatience
 
 
 thodi utsukata or bahut sari ummiido se apane dil ko sanvarkar ki aaj kii raat chand hindustan kaa ho jayega
 The Chandrayaan of Hindustan at the southern end of the moon has reached the last stage of its successful mission
 bas chand ghanton kii duuri par chand par hindustan hoga, lekin chand par hindustan kii kamyaabiyon ke kadam pahunchenge, usamen aakhri 15 minute behad chunauti bhare honge
 Chandrayaan-2 in the first 10 minutes of the last 15 minutes to the moon
 7 kilometre dur rah jayega
 After that in the next 38 seconds he will cover a distance of 5 kilometers
 iske agle 89 second main uski raftaar behad dhimi hogi or wo 400 meter kaa safar tay karegaa
 Chandrayaan-2, ready to land on the moon, click here to wish the best
 After this, in the next 66 seconds it will reach only 100 meters from the moon, but this path to reach the moon will not be easy
 aakhri 100 meter kii duuri par lander vikram landing ko lekar aakhri faisla karegaa
 Before the lander landed on the moon, ISRO explained through a video how a soft landing would take place
 Such a mission would be carried out in the machine to ensure a soft landing on the surface of the science of land
 - Lander Position Detection Camera, Lander Horizontal Velocity Camera And Lander Hazards Detection and Avoidance Cameras are installed
 iske saath do band-ultimetre-1 or ultimetre-2 hai
 Along with touching the lunar surface of the lander, ISRO will deploy three devices namely Chest, Rambha and Ilsa
 lander vikram ke chand par utarane ke baad iske bheetar se rover ‘pragyan’ baahar nikalegaa or ek chandra diwas yani prithvi kii 14 dinon kii avadhi tak apane vaigyanik kaaryon ko anjaam detaa rahegaa
 The water and mineral will be detected in the moon, the prognostics will just pass a fine gap of time and India will become the first country in the world to land on the invisible south pole of the moon
 chand par ye soft landing khud main ek itihaas he, to saath hi chunauteepurn bhi he, kyonki isse pehle isro ne kabhi aisi prakriya ko anjaam nahin diya tha
 His ramp will open 2 hours after the lander Vikram landed on the moon
 iske andar se rover pragyan baahar aayega or apane vaigyanik prayog shuru kar degaa
 Ignorance will go to the south pole of the moon where there is no light
 ye ilaaka andhkaar main duba rahata he, lekin yahaan pani hone kii sambhaavna he
 Knowledge will tell whether there is water or not? At the same time, it will also find out whether there are any mineral etc
, this information is also important because water will be needed to build a space station on the Moon
 22 july ko jab chandrayan-2 chand ke liye niklaa tha, to ek mukammal antariksh yaan tha
 Gradually, it has two parts, the orbiter and the lander
 ab rover yani pragyan bhi alag hone vaala he
 Tracking these three will be a big challenge for ISRO scientists, but with 48 days of great practice, ISRO scientists have made the distance a child's game, which finds the moon three hundred and 84 thousand kilometers away from the earth

 Hindustani Awam Morcha president Jitan Ram Manjhi made it clear on Thursday that the decision that the BJP will take in this matter will be accepted
 upendra kushvaha kii raah chale jeethanram maanjhiisase pehle endie kii ghatak rashtriya lok samta party ke mukhiya upendra kushvaha ne elaan kiya ki seat bantwaare par bijepi jo bhi faisla legi, unhen manjuur hoga
 At the same time, Jitan Ram Manjhi also repeated the words of Kushwaha after a meeting with bjp's Bihar election incharge Anant Singh
 unhone kaha, 'bihar ke hit main jo hoga ham karenge
 We will accept the PM and Amit Shah's decision
 'haalanki sutron ke mutabik bijepi maanjhi ko wo 13 siten dene ko raji ho gai hai, jo unheen kii party ke vidhayakon ke paas hai
 It is important to note that Kilok Janashakti Party also wants tickets for the same 13 seats
 seat bantwaare kaa maamlantim charan main: anant singhnant singh ne kaha he ki endie ke sabhi ghatak dalon ke saath siton ko lekar baatcheet antim charan main he or jald antim faisla le liya jayega

 Till today, there has been no success in stopping the Bangladeshi infiltrators crossing the international border through Pakistan to Pakistan
 lekin ab is masale ne or bhi gambhir rup le liya he
 On 8 July, a Bangladeshi intruder was caught in the Tanot area near the international border adjoining Jaisalmer, from whom a fake voter ID card of the Election Commission of India was found
 biguef ke hathe chadhe 39 varshiya shahidul islam ke paas se baraamad matadaata pahchaan patr par 24 uttari pargana kaa pataa likhaa tha jabaki vah dhaka kaa nivasee he
 Five days before this incident, an intruder Bangladeshi maulvi was caught from Munabav area of barmer, he also got fake voter ID card from him
 barmer police adheekshak hemanth sharma bataate hai, “matadaata pahchaan patr ke jariye usne bharat main sim jari karwaai thi
 After being caught, he threw and broke Sim
 uske paas kuch nakshe bhi mili hai isliye andeh or bhi gaharaa rahaa he
 This cleric named Shamsuddin was also successful in escaping from GRP custody
 chaar din tak vah khufia agenciyon kii naak ke neeche barmer ke hi ek madrase main maulavee banakar rahaa
 However, later he again went to the security agencies
 gaur talab he ki shamsuddin ke pakade jane ke baad khufia agenciyon ko aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba kii ore se barmer sahit rajasthan ke das railway steshnon ko udaane kii dhamkee mili thi
 Intelligence agencies are taking this threat seriously
 pichley maah bhi biguef ne jaisalmer se lagati pakistan kii seemaa ke najadik chaar bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ko pakadaa tha
 Three of these were found to have fake voter ID cards of India
 pichley maheene simavarti tanot kshetra main bhi chaar bangladeshi ghuspaithiye pakade gaye the
 The man named Ayyasin Mian had brought the remaining three intruders named Sohail Mian, Junab Ali and Junaid Ahmed to India from the Bangladeshi border bordering Benpol region
 poochtacha main in ghuspaithiyon ne bataaya ki ve beeti 1 march ko bhartiya seemaa main ghuse the
 a man named Mohammad Ayyasin brought him from Belgaum to Malda
 yahaan ve ek hafte tak abdul kalam naam ke sthaneey vyakti ke ghar main ruke the
 Kalam had made his fake identity card, on the strength of which these four came to Delhi from Malda railway station and here they also bought a local SIM
 biguef ke adhikariyon ke mutabik, ayasin miyaan se poochtacha main pataa chalaa he ki vah pehle bhi do baar jaisalmer se lagati antarrashtriya seemaa ke jariye pakistan ja chukaa he
 From here he went to Iran to do a job
 isse uski himmat badi lekin teesri baar ghuspaith karne kii koshish main pakadaa gaya
 (fake Indian voter card) The number of Bangladeshi infiltrators coming from across the border is increasing rapidly
 isaki vajah bataate hue biguef ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, “pichhali centre sarkaar ne seemaa paar se aa rahe bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon par halke hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karne ke nirdesh die the
 Therefore, in a year, the number of infiltrators has been reduced from 100 to 9
 ” upie sarkaar ne biguef ko bangladesh se lagati antarrashtriya seemaa paar se aane vaale ghuspaithiyon par pump acshan gan jaise halake hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karne ko kaha tha
 It is clear that vote bank politics has made India's borders very insecure
 rojgaar kii talash main iran jane vaale bangladeshiyon kii taadaad bhi teji se bad rahi he
 These people enter Pakistan's border illegally and go to Pakistan and from there take hold of Iran
 2011 se ab tak 55 se zyada bangladeshi ghuspaith karte pakade gaye hai, jo pakistan hote hue naukari karne iran janaa chaahate the
 If the country is to be protected then borders have to be chalked

 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main jamini hakeekat na bhaanp paane ke chalate bispi ek bhi seat jeet paane main naakaam rahi thi
 Taking lessons from this, Mayawati no longer wants to repeat past mistakes

 They did not hesitate to cut the ticket of their previously announced candidates for the assembly elections from the confidential information received from these committees
 pichley teen maheenon main alag-alag siton par 30 se zyada bispi ummidavaar badale ja chuke hai
 Apart from the last assembly and Lok Sabha elections, this time, Mayawati has tried to fill the void created by the opposition parties by placing her party in front of the media directly on every incident related to UP
 bispi ke liye do saal baad 10 june ko aae vidhaan parishad chunaav ke nateezon ne nae rakt kaa sanchaar kiya he
 If we look at the number force in the assembly, according to that, the BSP was able to win only two of its candidates in the Legislative Council elections, but 14 mlas of other parties took the elephant's favor and crossed the third candidate

 Mayawati is meeting with these office-bearers in the first week of every month and is taking "feedback" of every assembly constituency
 congress kii ''team pike", sapa kii ''akhilesh brigade" or bijepi kii ''modi-shah jugalbandi" kaa jawaab dene ke liye mayawati ne apane ''booth cader" ko dhar di he
 Under this, the state assembly area is now being divided into different parts at the booth level
 misaal ke taur par agra ko len
 The BSP has divided the nine assembly segments of the district into 40 sectors
 har sector main kshetrafal ke anusaar 300 se 350 booth hai
 By October last year, all sector committees were formed and now the work of forming a committee at the booth level has also been completed 80 percent

 The booth at which the society has more votes, the booth of the same caste is being made president

 dalit-muslim-backward Equation: For the first time, Mayawati has relied on the dalit-muslim-backward Equation to win the 2017 Assembly elections

 mayawati vidhansabha str par maujuud sector cametiyon se feedback lekar na keval ummidavaar tay kar rahi hai, balki ghoshit pratyaashiyon ko badla ja rahaa he
 Seeing the possibility of the upper caste candidates being fielded by the BJP and SP from the Ayodhya assembly seat of the most sensitive Faizabad in UP, Mayawati bets on the Muslim candidate Bazmi Siddiqui by cutting the ticket of the backward caste candidate Jayakaran Verma
 vidhansabha chunaav main kisi prakaar kaa jokhim na lete hue mayawati ne is baar apane sabhi varisht netaaon ko maidan main utaara he
 The party's state president Ram Achal Rajbhar, who was once the bsp's stronghold Ambedkar Nagar's Akbarpur seat, has been made a candidate by canceling the claim of his son Sanjay Rajbhar

" "mayawati ne bhale hi assam ke sandarbh main congress kaa naam liya tha, lekin nishane par upi hi tha
 After saving the Congress government in Uttarakhand, Mayawati played a key role in the victory of Congress candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand to form a front against the BJP at the central level and thereby win the confidence of the Muslim votes of UP in a dilemma

 mahangaai ne jahaan aam aadmi ko aate, daal kaa bhav yaad dilaa diya he, vahiin isaki maar se ravan kaa ‘kad’ bhi ghat gaya he
 The tradition of burning the effigy of Kumbhakarna and Meghnad with Ravana on Vijayadashami or Dussehra has been going on for centuries
 dilli main vibhinn sthanon par putale banane kaa kaam vijaydashami se do-dhai maheene pehle se shuru ho jaataa he or jagah-jagah sadakon ke kinare putale rakhe dikhaai dene lagate hai
 But this year, due to restrictions due to Commonwealth Games along with inflation, the work of making effigies is slowing down
 putala banane vaale kaarigaron ke anusaar, is saal putalon kii maang kaaphi ghat gai he
 The prices of materials used to make mannequins have doubled compared to last year
 saath hi rashtramandal khelon kii vajah se bhi is baar putalon ke kaaphi kam order hi mil paae hai
 Due to this, the stature of Ravan has decreased, that is, orders of small effigies are being received, while its prices have also increased
 duusari ore kumbhakarna or meghnad ke putalon ke to kharidaar hi nahin mil rahe
 Tatarpur village in West Delhi has been the main center of the effigies of Ravana for many years
 yahaan ke kaarigaron ke mutabik, mahangaai ke saath rashtramandal khelon kii vajah se is baar putalon kii maang kaaphi ghat gai he
 Till last year, where the cost of a 50-foot mannequin was Rs 5,000-6,000 thousand, this year it has reached Rs 8,000 to 9,000
 mahendra or subhash ravan vaale ke mahendra kehete hai, ‘‘pichley saal ravan ke putalon kaa daam 100-125 rupee prati foot tha, vahiin is baar yah 150 se 200 rupee prati foot par pahunch gaya he
 "mahendra, who has been making effigies of Ravana for about 35 years, said," This year the material of making effigies of Ravana has become very expensive
 pichley saal 20 bans 800 se 900 rupee main mil jate the, vahiin is saal inkaa daam 1,700-1,800 rupee par pahunch gaya he
 "the identity of the village of Tatarpur is due to the effigies of Ravana
 sattar ke dashak main yahaan chhuttan laal ne ravan ke putale banane kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Because of this, his name was called 'ravana Wala Baba'
 aaj unke kai shargid is parampara ko aage badha rahe hai
 Mannequin artisans come mainly from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana
 ravan vaala baba ke ek anya shargid naresh kumaar bataate hai ki tatarpur main har saal 1,500 ravan ke putale banate the
 But this time this figure will only reach 1,000
 haryana ke karnal se yahaan putala banane aae karigar subhash ne kaha ki vah agast se aktubar tak putala banane har saal tatarpur jarur aate hai
 Work in a factory for the rest of the month
 naresh kaa kahana he ki tatarpur main ham paanch se lekar pachaas foot tak ke ravan banaate hai
 This time orders are coming down due to inflation
 unhone kaha ki mahangaai ke saath is baar rashtramandal khelon kii vajah se bhi sadakon ke aasapaas putale rakhane main kaaphi pareshaani aa rahi he
 Due to the restrictions imposed due to the Commonwealth Games, the organizers of Ramlila are still shying away from placing orders
 kaarigaron kaa kahana he ki ravan ke putalon kii maang ghat gai he, to vahiin kumbhakarna or meghnad ke putalon ke liye order hi nahin mil rahe hai
 Another artisan Praveen said that Ravan of Tatarpur goes to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh besides Delhi
 is baar bhi in rajyon se order mili hai
 "sometimes the effigies of this place used to go to Australia, Canada and America
" par ab videshon se putalon ke order nahin milte hai
 Mahendra, who has created an effigy for the scene of Ravana Dahan from a Bollywood film, says, "there is no longer that fascination in this work, which used to be 15-20 years ago
" apanaan bacchaan ko main is peshey main nahin laaunga
 'mahendra told that last year he had made 100 mannequins, but this year till date only orders of 25 mannequins have been received
 kumbhakarna or meghnad ke vah sirf chaar-paanch putale hi banaaenge
 However, the hope of these artisans, who have kept this centuries-old tradition alive, is that after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games, the restrictions will be removed and the Ramlila organizers' apprehensions will be removed, so that they will receive orders for the effigies

 Terming the Rajkot speech of Congress President Sonia Gandhi as 'faded', Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that the Congress is keeping its feet firmly in the state due to the fear of retaliation

 There was no fact in it and when the media did not find anything interesting in the speech, they published big pictures of him
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ve (congress) bhaybheet hai or saavdhaanee ke saath bol rahe hai

 isamen koi tathy nahin tha or jab media ko bhaashan main kuch bhi dilachasp baat nahin mili to unhone unki badi-badi tasviren prakashit kar deen
 "they (congress) are afraid and are speaking with caution," he said

 Mayawati said that FDI in retail means giving the right to earn profits to foreign companies in the most profitable sector in the country
 In such a situation 'our party and the people of the country believe that this will lead to farmers, small shopkeepers and cottage Industries etc
 will be destroyed
 ’unhone kaha ki iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib logon par padegaa, desh kii arthvyavastha charmara jaayegi or desh phir se videshi vyapaariyon ke haathon main chalaa jaayegi

 Describing the 2014 general elections as unprecedented, he said party workers worked hard in the electoral battle
 adwani ne apane awaas par tirangaa jhanda fahraane ke baad kaha, 'maine 1952 se ab tak ke sabhi chunaav dekhe hai
 When the 2014 elections were over, i realized that these elections were unprecedented for myself and for the party
 main aahlaadit tha kyonki aise parinaam isse pehle kabhi nahin aae
 Our party workers worked hard in these elections
 haalanki unhone kaha, 'lekin main is baat se inkaar nahin karuunga ki is jeet main zyaadaatar yogadan vipaksh kaa tha jo mere khilaaf lard rahe the

 He said, 'because of the great victory, our expectations have also increased
 ' On the morning of 16 May, Narendra Modi and BJP brought a new flight

 History is not only to bring more than 300 seats on its own, but also to become the first party after 1984 to get an absolute majority
 lekin narendra modi ke liye bhi sabakuch itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Obviously, when success was so big, it would have been difficult to go through many difficult paths to reach the destination

 ham aapako bataate hai narendra modi virdohi netaaon ke aise kuch bayaan jisamen unhone taal thokkar ye daawa kiya tha ki narendra modi is desh ke pradhanmantri kabhi nahin ban sakate
 The first thing was Mani Shankar Aiyar, who was once a Union Minister in the Congress government, who said very confidently in a TV interview on 17 January 2014, 'narendra Modi will not become the Prime Minister of this country, will not become, will not become
 'doosraa number narendra modi ke dhur virodhiyon me bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa he
 In a special conversation from today till 3 April 2014, Nitish had said that it is impossible for Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister
 teesraa number congress ke netaa kapil sibbal kaa he
 Kapil Sibal, while talking to Aaj Tak on May 2, 2014, said that in a democratic country like India, it is impossible for Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister
 lekin aaj kii taarikh main alam ye he ki kapil sibbal apni seat bhi nahin bachaa paae
 The fourth number is that of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 apane badbolepan ke liye jane jane vaale lalu yadav ne bhi bade hi aatmavishvaas se ye daawa kiya tha ki narendra modi kaa pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana hameshaa sapana hi rah jayega
 But after the election results, Lalu's entire political career has started to be questioned
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi narendra modi kabhi pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar nahin mana
 Narendra Modi has always been his target
 khud ko desh ke muslimon kaa maseehaa bataane vaale mulaayam singh yadav bhi kahaan kam the
 While addressing an election meeting on 7 April, Mulayam Singh also claimed that Narendra Modi cannot become the Prime Minister of this country
 nateezon ke baad alam ye he ki puure upi main sirf 2 siton par hi samaajawaadee party jeet pai he

 Tyagi, the former chief of the Air Force, has also been asked to deposit Rs two lakh as bail

 italvi court ke faisle main purv aieef chif es pi tyaagi kaa bhi naam saamne aayaa
 ASG Tushar Mehta, appearing in the court on behalf of CBI, said that the records that CBI has right now are very high and the agency needs more time to read them and present the case in a logical manner
 tyaagi ke vakil ne bachaav karte hue adaalat main kaha ki jaanch abhi praarambhik daur main hi he
 It is an economic crime and all the evidence is in the form of documents
 sibiai ne bhi kabhi yah aarope nahin lagaaya he ki tyaagi ne kabhi kisi sakshya se chhedchhad yaa kahin bhaagane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Therefore, Tyagi should get bail if there is no such apprehension
 tyaagi ke vakil ne yah bhi kaha ki unki umr 72 saal ho gai he or unke heart kii bypass surgery hui he
 He is fully cooperating in the investigation
 tyaagi ke vakil ne kaha ki sibiai ne italy ke apliy adaalat ke nirnay ke aadhaar par is maamle ko sahi tehra rahi he, jabaki italy kii supreme court ne ise khaarij kar diya he

" ’’ nitish ne naaraazgi jaahir karte hue do took shabdon main kaha tha ki unki anumati ke bina ye chitra koi kaise chhap saktaa he or ukt vigyaapan ko lekar karrwai kiye jane kii baat kahi thi
 He also canceled a dinner hosted in honor of BJP representatives
 bebaak / krishnagopal mishrajammu-kashmir rajya se dhara 370 hataae jane ke uparaant pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan or unke mantri bharat ko baar-baar parmaanu yuddh kii dhamkiyaan de rahe hai
 Today, on the one hand, destructive clouds of fierce warfare are sweeping across the Indian borders from the Pakistani horizon and on the other hand the whole world including India is busy preparing to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi with pomp
 ahimsa or hinsa, prem or dwesh kaa dwand jari he
 The reasons and consequences of this duel require serious discussion
 yah vimarsh puraana-itihaas ke darpan main ubhare pratibimbon kii sahaayta se bhalee-bhaanti samajha ja saktaa he; ateet kii bhuulon kii samiksha kii ja sakati he, jo ki kiya janaa aavashyak bhi he or inke madhyam se bhavishya kii lok mangalakaari ranneeti rachi ja sakati he
 Just as the physical and natural worlds are composed of conflicting elements
 unamem vish bhi he or jeevandaayini aushadhiyaan bhi hai; sukhopbhog ke aparimit sansaadhan hai to abhaav ke vipannataa-grast athaah sagar bhi hai, usee prakaar maanav-man bhi prem-ghrinaa, shanti-krodh, utsaah-bhay aadi paraspar virdohi bhaavon se samrudh he
 Life rests on their balance
 inamen se kisi ek ko adhik mahatv dete hue duusare ko purna rup se asweekaar karnaa santulan ko baadhit karnaa he, kintu kabhi-kabhi itihaas ke patal par aise mahamanav avatarit hote hai jo is santulan kii upeksha kar apni agrahi pravriti sat kii ore is seemaa tak mode dete hai ki jansamanya kaa jivan-path kantakakirn ho jaataa he
 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata period and Mahatma Gandhi's contemplation in the first half of the twentieth century have inadvertently threatened social life by neglecting balance
 yah vyavahaarat: siddh he ki itihaas swayan ko doharaata he
 Periods and characters change, the nature of events also change substantially, but thoughts and actions remain almost identical
 yahi itihaas kaa duharna he kintu vidambnaa yah he ki manushya itihaas ko jaanate hue bhi, purv main ghatit ghatnaon ke parinaamon se parichit hokar bhi vahi trutiyaan karata he jo ateet main ghaatak siddh ho chuki hoti hai
 This repetition of history in Indian society and literature is reflected in the personality and work of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira and Mahatma Gandhi
 dharmraj yudhisthir satyawadee hai ,sahishnu hai or prayek paristhiti main swayan ksht sahakar bhi bandhutav ke aakankshi hai
 This trend is also reflected in the nature of Mahatma Gandhi
 ve bhi algaavvaadi muslim maansikta se maitri ke abhilaashi hai or uski har shart sweekaar karne ko tatpar milte hai
 Almost all the incidents from the Khilafat movement to the partition of India underline this fact
 jis prakaar kauravon ke samaksh yudhisthir ke samast maitri praytn vifal hote hai or duryodhana kii ucchakanksha se utpann rajabhilashaa hastinapur ke vibhaajan kaa kaaran banati he usee prakaar mahatma gandhi ke bhi sabhi praytn nishphal hote hai or antat bharat-vibhaajan kii algaavvaadi kootneeti safal ho jaati he
 Here Mahatma Gandhi, the emblem of the then Indian leadership, forgets that the division of the state is not a meaningful and permanent solution to the disruptive separatist thinking
 yadi hota to hastinapur or indraprastha do swatantra rajya ban jane ke uparaant kauravon kaa pandavon ke prati ishrya-dwesh samaapt ho jaataa or donon rajyon ke shaasha apni-apni simaaon main sukh purvak rah lete kintu aisa nahin hua or hastinapur-rajya vibhaajan ke uparaant pandavon ke purusharth se nirmit indraprastha ko hastgat karne ke nae kuta praytn punah prarambh ho gaye
 Exactly the same situation appears after the devastation of partition of India
 pakistan ne astitv main aate hi hindustan ke liye nai museebataan khadi karnaa prarambh kar diya
 One who could not live in a house did not sit in peace even as a neighbor
 itihaas kii yah pramanik sikh ki desh kaa vibhaajan dweshpurn madaandh maansik-vyaadhi kaa sahi upachaar nahin he -- aadhunik bharat ke netritv ne sarvatha upekshit kii or ek nae mahabharat kii neenv daal di, jiskaa bigul vigat 70 barsh se baj rahaa he or ab mahaasangram kaa shankhanaad bheeshan sanhaar ke liye aatur he jiskaa sanket paak pradhanmantri shri imran khan dwaara you

 It is clearly found in the statement given from the platform of dharmraj yudhisthir ke ucch adarsh or sadbhaav unki mahanata ko pratipaadit kar unhen aadarneey or bahumanya banaate hai kintu dhritarashtra, shakuni or duryodhana jaisi kutil maansikta yudhisthir kii sahrudayata ko sweekaar nahin karti
 His power gluttony scoffs at Yudhishthira's peaceability as cowardice
 yahi sthiti aadhunik bharat kii raajnneeti main tab dekhi ja sakati he jab duryodhani bhaavon se bhari tathakthith kaayade ajam muhammadli jinna kii alag desh kii maang mahatma gandhi kii sari anunay-vinay thukraa kar ‘sidhi-kaarywahi‘ kii dhamkee detii hui nirdosh hinduon ke narsanhaar ko badhaava detii he or antat pakistan banavaakar hi maanati he
 No satyagraha is successful here
 prem, ahimsa, bandhutav or sah-astitv ke saare divyastra yahan ek nishthur duraagrah ke samaksh dam todate dikhaai dete hai
 If a disease is not treated properly in time, it gradually becomes stronger and becomes fatal
 mahabharat main hastinapur kii rajyasatta ne andhe putrmoh main shakuni or duryodhana kii aapraadhik shadyantrkaari maansikta kaa koi upachaar nahin kiya
 As a result, the cruel mentality that poisoned Bhima in childhood eventually led to a terrible destruction in the Kurukshetra field
 bharat-vibhaajan kii vishbeli kaa beej bhi mahatma gandhi kii tushtikaran vaali mohagrast durniti se sinchit hokar pallavit or pushpit hua tathaa pakistan banate hi vahaan ke lakhon hinduon - sikhon ke sarvanaash evam visthaapan kaa kaaran bana
 If Jyeshtha Panduputra Yudhishthira, while exercising his responsibility, would have given fair response to Duryodhana's giving poison to Bhima and demanded justice from bhishma-dhritarashtra etc
 it was very likely that Shakuni was expelled from Hastinapur if the conspiracy was busted
 Jat and Duryodhana's immature adolescent-mind be cremated-refined and given a new creative direction Ta and then history would not have to see the horrific destruction of Mahabharata
 jo bhul yudhisthir ne shakuni or duryodhana ke krur-krity par dhul daalkar kii vahi aitihaasik bhul bharat vibhaajan kii amangalakaari maang karne vaale mohammad ali jinna ko aavashyaktaa se adhik mahatv dekar mahatma gandhi ke netritv man doharaai gai
 If other liberal-minded leaders like Abdul Ghaffar Khan were replaced by Mohammad Ali Jinnah and discouraged the demand for a radical Muslim League, we would most likely not have to bear the brunt of the tragedy of Partition
 vivekahin andhi adarsh-priyata swayan ke hi nahin, swajanon ke bhi ksht kaa kaaran banati he
 Yudhishthira, living in Indraprastha happily after the Rajasuya Yajna, without considering it; Accidents in the past blindly obeyed Dhritarashtra's order without any education and entered Hutinapur's Gutakrida Griha and lost everything and caused humiliation to himself and his family
 unke ek avivekpurna krity ne naa keval unhen unki rajyashri se vanchit kiya apitu unke digvijayi bhaaiyon sahit draupadi ko bhi 12 varsh ke banavaas or 1 varsh ke agyatavaas hetu sankatapann jivan-path par dhakel diya
 Similarly, without giving serious thought to the future ill effects of partition of India, the Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi, approved the partition and put the wealth, honor and life of millions of countrymen in jeopardy
 is avivekpurna nirnay ne naa keval us samay sanhaar kii gahare ghaav die apitu desh ke viruddh bhavi parmaanu yuddh kii prishthbhumi bhi nirmit kar di
 If Pakistan had not been formed at that time, it would not have been Pakistan-inspired terrorism today, neither would there have been a problem of Jammu and Kashmir, nor would China have the opportunity to execute a fighting strategic campaign against us on the soil of Pakistan and neither would the war-torn Pakistani power have nuclear against India
 Could have made the bomb
 pakistan banaae jane ke prastaav kii sweekruti nishchay hi yudhishthiri adarshandh maansikta kii bhayanak bhul thi 
 People like Yudhishthira and Mahatma Gandhi leave their indelible mark on the page of society and history due to their liberal and lofty ideology
 ve yug-yug ke liye vandaneey or poojya ban jate hai kintu anyaay, atyaachaar evam utpeedan ke ahamkaari shikhar dhahaane main ve kitne safal rahete hai, yah kahana kathin he
 Such extraordinary intellectual property-rich personalities get easy public support, but the powers associated with power do not care about them and sometimes they are seen standing in opposition to them with their stereotypes
 mahabharat main bhishma-dron aadi kaa kauravon ko samarthan or british pratinidhi lord mountbenton kii swargeey jinna ke prati atirikt aasakti or pakistan ke nirmaan main unki ruchi is tathy kii sakshi he
 The fortifications of exploitation and oppression do not break with the advanced intellectual achievements of religion and philosophy
 unhen dhahaane ke liye prachand baahubal or apurv ran-kaushal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The destruction of the Kauravas is possible through the mace of Bhima and the destruction of his assistant Karna with the political vision of Krishna, Arjuna's Gandiva
 british samrajya se mukti kaa svarnim adhyay bhi subhaashachandr bose ke rankaushal or shastrdhari krantikariyon ke lahu se likhaa gaya he
 It is so important that Mahatma Gandhi has played an important role in creating the necessary pages for the writing of freedom-history
 ‘himalay’ sheershak rachana main rashtrakavi dinakar ne himalay ko sambodhit karte hue likhaa he -‘‘re roak yudhisthir ko na yahan,jane do unako swarg dheer!lautaa hamako gandiv-gadalauta de arjuna-bhim vir

 yahaan vyakt vichaar unke apane hai or usase india today kii sahmati aavashyak nahin he)*** The political heat of West Bengal was also felt in Delhi on Thursday
 pashchim bengal ke bijepi netaa dopaher kareeb ek baje north block pahunche or rajya main kathith tiemasi kaaryakartaaon ke hinsaatmak ravaiye kii grahamantri rajnath singh se shikaayat kii
 During the last few days, there have been many complaints about attacks on BJP offices and leaders in various parts of West Bengal
 bijepi netaaon kaa aarope he ki trinmul congress ke saansad sudeep bandopadhyaay kii giraftaar ke baad se tiemasi kaaryakarta bijepi netaaon ke ke ghar, daftaron or kaaryakartaaon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 BJP leaders, citing the attacks, demanded the central government to intervene in the matter
 saansadon ke is dal main bijepi mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey, bengal prabharee siddharthanath singh, kendriya mantribabul supriyosamet anya netaa maujuud the
 These mps said that the law and order situation in West Bengal has broken down and surprisingly the Chief Minister himself is working to incite his party to violence
 yun to grahamantri rajnath singh kisi bhi rajya main hone vaali ghatana par tippanee karne se bachate hai, lekin jab maamla apni hi party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa ho to pahal to dikhaani padegi
 Therefore, the Home Ministry has also sought a report from the West Bengal government on this issue
 bijepi netaaon ke jate hi trinmul congress ke netaaon ne sibiai karrwai ke khilaaf south blaak ke saamne pradarshan kiya
 After a lot of struggle, the Delhi Police could remove them there
 beete dinon trinmul ke saansadon ne sansad ke bheetar gandhi kii pratimaa ke saamne pradarshan kiya tha, unka maananaa he ki jab tak centre sarkaar apana taanashaah ravaiya nahin badalati, tab tak vah isi tarah virodh darj karaati rahegi
 Is Jitan Ram Manjhi going to be the center point of Bihar politics once again? After the statement of RJD leader Lalu Prasad, his importance has increased again
 lalu kaa kahana he ki hamaari koshish dharmanirpeksh takaton ko ekajute rakhane kii honi chahie - or iske liye wo maanjhi ko bhi saath lene ke paksh main hai
 Obviously, Nitish will not like this thing at all
 lalu ke liye kitne ahm hai maanjhiisase pehle lalu kii party argedy ke netaa raghuvansh prasad singh nemanjhi ko nitish sarkaar main dipti siem banane kii salaahdi thi
 Lalu's consent was also believed to be behind that statement
 abmanjhi ko lekarlalu ke taaja bayaan ke kya myne kya ho sakate hai?janata parivaar kaa vilay ab tak nahin ho sakaa he
 The exercise is going on, but the chances of this are also quite low
 aise main lalu prasad or or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii partiyon main gathbandhan hoga
 Both leaders are trying to get more seats in their account
 siten to usee ko zyada milengi jo zyada majboot padegaa yaa jiske paas koi or tarksangat aadhaar hoga
 It is said that Nitish wants to divide on the basis of the seats won in the last assembly elections
 lalu chaahate hai ki 2014 ke lok sabha chunaav share ke hisaab se bantwaaraa ho

 Both the tone and tone of the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi have changed
 ab vah ran nahin yachana kii bhashaa bol rahi he
 Deputy CM Manish Sisodia spoke at a press conference on Friday evening and the manner in which it seems to mean something
 dipti siem manish sisodiya ne kaha ki "hoicourt ke faisle ke baad transfar posting ke saare maamle chuni hui sarkaar ke haath main nahin hai, alji ke haath main hai, isliye hamaara alji se nivedan he ki mohalla clinics or skool nirmaan ke kaam main lage afasaron ko unke pad se na hataaen

 "sisodia said," After the High Court order, we have no confusion about this at the moment, so we are not saying anything to anyone else but requesting the people of Delhi to LG
 '' It is worth noting that since the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in the last one and a half years, every minister of the Kejriwal government has been challenging the rights of LG and most of the rights have been argued by the elected government to be extremely aggressive or aggressive mood

 a post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Aug 1, 2018 at 3:21am PDT Tarun Gogoi told PM Modi: Following the footsteps of modern jinnacha-jinnah, PM Modi: Former state chief minister and senior Congress leader Tarun Gogoi has given a sharp statement about Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 tarun gogoi ne piem modi ko bharat kaa 'aadhunik jinna' bataaya
 Regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, Gogoi said that Modi is following in Jinnah's footsteps
 gogoi ne kaha ki pakistan ne jo kiya, us raste kaa anusaran ab modi kar rahe hai or use lagu bhi kar rahe hai, lekin congress tab bhi aisa nahin chaahati thi
 He said that even when Pakistan wanted to create an Islamic state, the Congress wanted a secular state and the Congress is still opposing it
 'jinna ke nakshekadam par koun?purv siem gogoi ne sawaal uthaaya ki aakhir abhi jinna ke nakshekadam koun chal rahaa he? gogoi ne kaha ki aap (modi) jinna ke raste chal rahe hai or aap bharat ke aadhunik jinna hai
 He said that all the people of Assam are on the roads, why is Assam burning and who is responsible for it? The Prime Minister and the Union Minister are responsible for all this
 gogoi ne kaha ki agar naagarikta sanshodhan act sau fisad sahi he, to phir desh ke anya hisson or videshon main naaraazgi kyon he? unhone kaha ki aap dharmik aadhaar par desh ko baant rahe hai, logon ko ek saath laane ke bajaay puri tarah se vibhaajankaree niti apana rahe hai, ekta ke bajaay ghrinaa paidaa kar rahe hai
 'there is no difference between Modi and Jinnah' Gogoi said that PM Narendra Modi plays a contradictory role, doing what Jinnah did
 gogoi ne kaha ki mujhe aap (modi) or jinna ke bich koi fark nahin he, aap apane mul vichaar ko puraa karne ke liye hindu raashtra banane ke makasad kii ore bad rahe hai
 The senior Congress leader further said that the Citizenship Amendment Act is a violation of the basic structure of the Constitution and the Assam Accord, so people are angry
 unhone kaha ki assam ke log videshiyon ko dharm ke aadhaar par fark nahin karte hai, dharm naagarik banane kaa maapdand nahin ho saktaa he

 One can wear it only in special conditions by mixing gold with silver
 chaandi ke bartanon ko hameshaa saafe karte rahen, tabhi unka prayog karen
 Those who have more emotional problems should be cautious in the use of silver

 Silver is not very favorable for Aries, Leo and Sagittarius
 baaki raashiyon ke liye chaandi ke parinaam saamaanya hai
 Impossible remedies that shine silver fortunes - It is considered best to wear a pure silver ring in the little finger, because the unlucky moon starts giving auspicious effects and the balance of mind becomes very good

 Lauding Chief Minister Narendra Modi for the development of Gujarat, senior BJP leader LK Advani said that India can touch new heights globally if he adopts a policy of 'not tolerating' at all on corruption and terrorism
 modi ke ‘shanti ekta or sampradayik sadbhaav’ ke liye teen din ke upwas ke avasar par adwani ne kaha, ‘gujarat main acha prashasan he or aatankwaad evam bhrashtachar ke khilaaf katai bardaasht nahin karne kii niti he agar yah niti deshbhar main apanaayi jaati he to bharat nayi bulandiyon ko chhu legaa
 Giving credit to Modi for taking the state to new heights of development, he said, "whatever he (modi) said about six crore Gujaratis, he is right
" kya koi anya praant gujarat kii tarah 11 pratishat kii vikaas dar hasil kar sakaa he
 Commenting on Modi's speech at the fasting site, BJP leader Arun Jaitley said, "in the next few months, one thing and one word of Modi will be noticed

 Jaitley said, 'on the one hand we have a leadershipless government at the center, on the other hand we have a government in Gujarat which is helping to take the state to new heights
 ek ore hamaare paas eemaandaaree kii raajnneeti he or duusari ore bhrashtachar kii raajnneeti
 Describing Modi's fast as 'historic', he said that the way Gujarat has emerged on the national scene since 2002 after facing storm earthquakes and communal riots is a symbol of the strength of political leadership in the state

 dashakon tak gumnami baba kii kahani desh ke sabase rochak rahasyon main ek rahi he, jinaki faijabad main 1985 main mrityu ho gai thi
 In this story, there was always a sensation that this mysterious person who was changing the whereabouts was none other than Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who was spending the last years of his life in oblivion
 pichley 3 april ko akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne gumnami baba kii mul pahchaan pataa karne ke liye jaanch samiti baitaakar is paheli ko nayaa jivan de diya
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav told India Today, "we are human
" jab ham kisi rahasy ke bare main sunate hai to uski padtaal karne kii koshish karte hai
 However, the Chief Minister immediately made it clear that they were only following the directions of the High Court
 elahabaad hycourt ne 31 janvari, 2013 ko rajya sarkaar ko yah nirdesh diya tha ki vah gumnami baba kii vastuon ko sangrahalay main pradarshit kare or baba kii pahchaan pukhta karne ke liye ek jaanch ayog gathit kare
 Probation will be headed by a retired judge of the High Court and a team of experts will be involved
 yah faisla do yachikaaon ke jawaab main aayaa tha
 The first was filed by Netaji's niece Lalita Bose in 1986 and the second by BJP leader Shakti Singh in 2010
 inamen yah maang kii gai thi ki iskaa pataa lagaaya jaae ki gumnami baba koun the
 Nevertheless, the more the state government's action is to honor the court's decision, the more it is deeply politicized
 pichley saal india today ne netaji ke parijanon kii intelegence beuro kii do dashakon tak kii gai jasusi kaa pardaafash kiya tha
 After that Modi government and West Bengal's Mamta Banerjee government started the work of making 'netaji's files' public
 akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne bhi is disha main teji dikhaai
 To prevent the BJP from taking any political advantage from the court's decision, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to display Gumnami Baba's objects in the government 'ram Katha Museum' in Ayodhya
 modi sarkaar ne filon ko saarvajanik karne kaa kaam tej kiya to uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ne jaanch samiti gathit karne kaa aadesh de diya
 So far 150 files have been made public from the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office
 lekin inamen kisi bhi file main ab tak faijabad ke us rahasyamay fakir kaa zikr nahin mila he
 Anuj Dhar, who is doing research on Netaji, has described it as very strange
 anuj ne haal hi main akhilesh yadav se mulaakaat karke gumnami baba ke bare main jaanch karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 Anuj says, "the files made public also include questions related to RTI related to Netaji
 lekin ajeeb baat he ki 1986 se elahabaad hycourt main chal rahe is cese ke bare main in filon main kuch nahin he
 "they also say" Netaji would have claimed to be Subhash Chandra Bose if Baba Annami Baba had been a fraud
 '' haalanki netaji ke najdiki rishtedaar in kayaason ko galat bataate hai ki gumnami baba darasal khud netaji hi the
 Behind Closed Doors Three decades ago, Gumnami Baba's everyday articles were locked behind iron nets in the 'double Lock' section of Faizabad's District Treasury
 yah lalita bose kii 1986 kii us yachika ke jawaab main hycourt ke nirdesh ke tahat tha jisamen baba kii mul pahchaan kaa pataa lagane or unki vastuon ko surakshit rakhane kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha
 His 'everyday objects' remained in the Treasury
 pehle unki chaanbin netaji ke gaayab hone kii jaanch kar rahe justise mukherjee kamishan ne 1999 main kii or phir haal hi main us visheshgy samiti ne jise is saal march main akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne vastuon kii suchi taiyaar karne ke liye niyukt kiya tha
 The Treasury officials pull out these tin boxes, unlock them and very comfortably reveal the visual history of the man who always wanted to remain anonymous
 ajeeb baat yah thi ki jis vyakti ne kabhi apni koi photo nahin khinchne di, us baba ne kai sari photo jamaa kar rakhi thim
 Many of these photos were of the kin of Netaji Bose
 inamen netaji ke pita-mata janakinath or prabhavati kii frem kii hui tasviir he, netaji ke bachapan kii bhi tasviren hai jinamein ve apane bhai-bahanon ke saath najar aa rahe hai
 There are also three 'half-bent Dublin pipes' for drinking tobacco and accessories connected to them, such as pipe cleaning tools, binoculars, Rolex Oyster Perpetual Wristwatch with warranty, cassette tape player, portable typewriter, a radio, on Indian politics
 Dozens of books, including some written by Kuldeep Nayyar, copies of Neville Maxwell's India China War, Biographies of Subhash Bose and scores of Anand Bazar Patrika Pile
 chalis saal ke bheetar teesri sarkari jaanch kar rahe justise mukherjee jaanch ayog ne 2004 main yah nishkarsh nikaala ki netaji kii mrityu 1945 main vimaan haadase main nahin hui thi
 But the Commission also said that there is no firm evidence to say that Gumnami Baba was actually Netaji himself

 Gumnami Baba never claimed during his lifetime that he was Netaji, but decades after his death, the claim is strongly held that he was in fact Netaji
 baba ko hi netaji maanane vaale logon kaa daawa he ki sabase pukhta sakshya to 2010 kii vah documentary he jisamen justise mukherjee ko camere se pare yah kehete hue bataaya gaya he ki vah is baat par sau fisadi aashwast hai ki baba hi darasal netaji the
 There is a deep anecdote behind Gumnami Baba, bolstered by his extreme interest in the Bose family and his contact with former Netaji aide and freedom fighter Leena Roy and INA intelligence officer Pabitra Mohan Roy
 inke bich patrachaar 1960 ke dashak se lekar baba kii mrityu tak miltaa he
 Rita Banerjee, 64, an educationist and former principal of Jingle Bells School in Faizabad, vaguely remembers meeting Baba with her husband in the 1970s when Baba lived in Ayodhya
 unke sasur ek jane-maane homeopeth the jinaki maut 1984 main ho gai thi
 There was no doubt in his mind that Baba was none other than Netaji
 haalanki khud rita ise lekar ashankit raheen
 Says Banerjee, "bhagwanji never revealed his name and once described himself as a registered monk, that is, one whose name has been cut off from the world's books, the implication was that he had not become a monk of his choice
 '' ek anya maukey par baba ne is baat par dukh prakat kiya ki unka desh he, mata-pita hai, bhai-bahan hai lekin ve unamem se kisi ko bhi apana nahin kah sakate
 But Baba, who retired from the world, loved great things in life, just like all the 'babas' of today
 rolex ke alaava ve mahangi 555 cigarette pite the, kathith taur par unke paas nae karency noton kii aamad rahati thi or ve matan-keemaa va 'shukto' (ek bengali vyanjan) khaanaa bahut pasand karte the
 The two most controversial histories of Faizabad, which Ram Baba chose as his last residence, in 1982, bite each other
 yah do manjila imaarat jiske upar ek kesaria jhanda fahraata rahata he, guru dutt singh kaa bhi nivas he jo is jile ke magistrate rahe the or jinhone 1949 main vivaadit babari masjid dhaanche ke bheetar ramalala kii murti sthapit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Within this huge kothi, one of the many different rooms that Guru Dutt Singh's family has built, Baba lived at a rent of Rs 400 per month
 dashakon baad, guru dutt singh ke pote shakti singh baba kii kahani ko punerjeevit karne main apni bhoomika ko lekar gauravanvit hai
 Shakti Singh is also a member of the committee set up by the district administration to prepare a list of Baba's items
 ve apane ghar ke pichley hisse main hamen lekar jate hai jahaan ek chote-se 300 varg foot ke kamare main baba rahete the
 Shakti Singh claims that he never saw Baba's face
 1982 main ek sthaneey doctor ne ganje hote dadhi vaale baba ke liye cameraa kiraye par liya tha
 These tenants of Shakti Singh used to spend all their time inside the room
 unase milane bahut kam hi log aate the or ve kabhi apana cheharaa nahin dikhaate the
 He had a loud and resonating voice and wore double-sighted round glasses
 shakti singh kehete hai, ''ve hamase hameshaa khidki ke jariye baat kiya karte the or kabhi apana cheharaa nahin dikhaate the
 "shakti Singh says that not even once in three years has he seen the face of his father's tenant (a popular photo of Gumnami Baba is actually a computer-generated image produced by a newspaper in 2001)
" shakti singh kaa kahana he, ''lekin is baat ke kai paristhitijanya sakshya maujuud hai jinase yah sthapit ho jaataa he ki gumnami baba hi darasal netaji the
 "baba was also known as just one more name - Bhagwanji
" lekin rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke duusare pramukh em
 s
 golwalkar ke 16 sitambar, 1972 ko likhe gaye ek patr main, jo baba kii vastuon main se mila he, unka ek or naam saamne aata haih sangh pramukh ne unhen 'param poojyapad vijayanandji maharaj' likhakar sambodhit kiya he
 The reference to this letter is unclear, but it mentions: "I received your letters written between 25 August to 2 September on 6 September 1972
 main aapke dwaara ingit kii gai teen jagahon ke bare main pataa lagane kii koshish karuunga, lekin agar aap patr main ullikhit teen jagahon se judaa koi ek khaas sthaan spasht chinhit kar saken to nishchit taur par meraa kaary aasaan ho jayega
 On 16 September 1985, soon after Baba's death, the Shakti Singh family contacted Bose's family
 netaji kii bhatiji lalita bose faijabad main baba ke kamare par ain (is kamare se ab shakti singh kaa enjio subhash chandra bose rashtriya vichaar centre sanchalit hota he)
 Shakti Singh says, "he looked at Netaji's family photographs on the wall, looked at books, looked at the documents and spoke on the bed, he was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
" ''gumnami baba kii maut ke kuch hi hafton ke bheetar faijabad ke sthaneey akhabaaron ko kahani kii gandh aane lagi, khaas taur par jab baba kii vicitra vyaktigat vastuon kii jaankaree baahar chhanakar aane lagi
 Then on October 25, 1985, the banner of a local Hindi newspaper, Nayeev, was titled: "has Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose died anonymously in Faizabad?" This news created a sensation in the media and soon others The newspapers also took up the matter
 is tarah isse ek nai kahani kaa janm hua
 Baba's Museum: Now these two controversial histories of Faizabad are going to be again this year
 is saal agast main kisi samay, akhilesh yadav ram katha sangrahalay main gumnami baba kii vastuon, kitabon, pipe or photograph ke sangrahalay kaa udghaatan karenge
 The museum is located in a two-story concrete building on the banks of the Saryu River, barely a kilometer from the controversial Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid complex
 kul 12 karod rupye kii laagat se bana yah dhaancha pichhali janvari main puraa ho gaya tha
 The primary objects displayed in the museum include those neatly lined stones that are allegedly the ruins of the temple which was under the Babri Masjid demolished in Ayodhya in 1992
 pathar sangrahalay kii pehali manzil par pradarshit kiye gaye hai
 Gumnami Baba Gallery will be in four halls 4 to 7 of the museum
 har haul 5,000 varg foot kaa he
 Most people of the Bose family directly reject any such speculation that only Netaji was living there in disguise of Baba
 mumbai main vyavsaayee, netaji ke bhattije ardhendu bose is tarah kii kayaasabaajiyon ko behuda bataate hai
 He says, "not once has Baba ever tried to contact me or any other member of the Bose family, including Netaji's brother and nephew, who were still alive after 1990
" mujhe yaad nahin ki mere pita shailesh chandra bose ne kabhi in baba kaa zikr kiya ho
 "not believing that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was killed in a plane crash, who formed India's first government in exile, becomes a little clearer with Netaji's unusual life
 netaji najarbandi se bhaag nikle, pehle ek insurance agent ke rup main or phir ek italvi vyavsaayee ke rup main bhes badalakar ve pehle afghanistan, phir stallin ke soviet sangh or ant main hitler ke germany main pahunch gaye
 Eventually, he returned to south-east Asia in a submarine and formed the Azad Hind Fauj together with the Japanese
 in tamaam varshon main unhen kabhi china main to kabhi soviet sangh main to kabhi paris tak main dekhe jane kii afvaahen udati raheen
 Stories of Netaji's miraculous escape have merged with Baba and his life as saints and saints
 kam se kam teen anya baabaaon ke anuyaayi apane guru ke bhes badalakar rah rahe netaji hone kaa vishwaas karte rahe hai
 These include Sidhare Swami Shraddhanand Shaulmari Sadhu, who lived in Dehradun and in the late 1970s, Sadhu Jyotirdev, who lived in Shivpurkalan, Madhya Pradesh, and another Sadhu from Solapur in Maharashtra
 in mithkon main se bhi do kii to padtaal ho chuki he or ve khaarij kar die gaye hai
 Now Bari has tested the most reliable legend
 lakhanu ke ek tarkshakti shikshak adheer som kehete hai, ''yaa to ve netaji the yaa phir ve bhartiya itihaas main sabase lambii chali afvaahon main se ek ke mukhya kirdaar hai
 After three decades, the case of this mysterious fakir is also nearing its end
 madhya pradesh ke jabalpur jile se haroonges maamla saamne aayaa he
 If a family in Jamunia village did not invite the bully in marriage, they were boycotted
 parivaar ko na to gaanv kii dukaan se rashan mil rahaa he or na hi tankiyon se pani bhar paa rahe hai
 Tukaram Gond of Jamunia village under the Chargwa police station recently hosted a banquet on the occasion of his younger brother's wedding, in which some of the villagers did not arrive
 gond ke mutabik, usne parampara ke mutabik sabhi ko nyotaa diya tha
 But some did not attend the overbearing banquet
 unka kahana tha ki unhen sahi tareeke se nyotaa nahin diya gaya
 Tukaram said, 'after marriage, we are neither allowed to buy rations from the village shop nor to fill water
 hamane police main shikaayat kii lekin kisi ne shikaayat darj nahin kii or hamen kai ghante intjaar ke baad khaali haath lautnaa padaa
 Tukaram's family enlisted the help of the Jabalpur district administration, after which the local police filed their complaint
 jila prashasan se nirdesh milane ke baad sthaneey police kaa kahana he ki maamla donon pakshon ke bich maamla sulajh gaya he
 Sub Inspector SS Jharia of Chargwa Police Station said, 'there were some differences between the Gond family and others in the village
 lekin police ke dakhal ke baad maamla sulajh gaya he
 The village sarpanch Kishan Kumar Patel claims that the matter was overstated
 patel ne kaha, 'kisi ko rashan yaa pani bharne se nahin roka gaya
 This was a minor dispute, which was resolved
 ' haalanki peedit parivaar kaa daawa he ki un par shikaayat waapas lene kaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 The district administration has sought a report from the police in this case, while no case has been filed so far

 ab vah nausikhiyon kii tarah vyavhaar nahin kar rahi he
 Now she has come to know political tricks and has started using it
 apni raksha main vah raajnneetik aarope-pratyarope kaa sahaara lene lagi he
 The latest example is the allegation of his MLA that he had received an offer of crores of rupees to bring down the government
 sunne main to yah bada sansanikhej lagata he, lekin yatharth kii zamin par bilkul bachakaana
 Those who are aware of the ways of parliamentary democracy may laugh at this charge

 BJP or Congress also knows what can be the result of toppling the government of a party riding on public expectations
 janata ne jis tarah aam aadmi party ko samarthan diya, vah abhootpurv he
 In such a situation, what BJP, no party can yet attempt to topple its government
 unhen pataa he ki aisi sarkaar ko giraakar unhen janata ke aakrosh kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he or aisa jokhim ve kyon uthaaengi, khaskar jab loksabhaa chunaav sir par hon
 What will the party get except profanity by forging a government in Delhi? apni naakaamiyon ko chupaane ke liye party ke paas khaas kuch he nahin
 What he did in more than a month is in front of everyone
 is tarah ke mudde uchhaalkar thodi der ke liye uske kuch netaa surkhiyaan bator sakate hai, janata ko bharamaa sakate hai or bahala bhi sakate hai, lekin sawaal jo poocha ja rahaa he vah yah he ki party kii uplabdhiyaan kya-kya hai? sirf yah aarope laga dene se ki bade puunjipati uski sarkaar ko gira dena chaahate hai, kuch bhi siddh nahin hota
 And if it is so, then the leaders of the party should have taken away all the documents, so that something can be proved
 yah sab dekhakar itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he ki party ne ek purna raajnneetik dal ke rup main avatar lenaa shuru kar diya he
 Now many more such steps and statements can be expected from him
 ab jabaki loksabhaa chunaav sir par aa gaye hai, to aise aarope-pratyaropon kaa silsilaa chal padegaa
