 Before bringing the triple talaq bill to the Rajya Sabha, the government now wants to sit down with the opposition parties and agree on it
 mangalvaar ko sansad kii kaarywahi ke mutabik teen talaak bill ko rajyasabha main pesh karke ise paas bhi karana tha
 But seeing the atmosphere in favor of this bill, the government changed its mind and now this bill will be introduced in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 5 janvari tak kaa he sheetakaaleen satrais bill par mangalvaar ko charchaa ke liye naa laane kii ek or vajah yah rahi ki sarkaar pehle jiesti se sambandhit bill rajyasabha main paas karana chaahati he, jo loksabhaa main pehle hi paas ho chukaa he
 The winter session of Parliament is only till 5 January and the government first wants to pass its necessary bill
 swami bole-bijepi ke donon haath main laddubijepi netaa subramanyam swami ne kaha ki rajyasabha mentin talaak bilki haalat aisi he kii sarkaar ke donon hi haathon main laddu hai
 If the government passes this bill in the Rajya Sabha also, then BJP will get credit for bringing a law that provides justice to Muslim women
 lekin subramanyam swami ne kaha ki agar vipakshi partiyaan is bill ko roak detii hai to bhi BJP ko koi nuksaan nahin he kyonki tab iskaa virodh karne waalon ke chehre benakaab karne kaa mauka milegaa
 When asked by Subramanian Swamy that some people say that there is more provision of 3 years of jail for triple talaq, then he said that he thought there should be a sentence of 7 years instead of 3 years
 congress bill par karegi sanshodhan kii mancongress partybhi saaf kar chuki he ki vah is bill kaa virodh to nahin karegi, lekin isamen sanshodhan kii maang karegi
 The Samajwadi Party is also demanding amendment in this bill
 jane-maane vakil or rajyasabha ke saansad maajid menon ne bhi kaha ki sarkaar ne is bill ko jaldbaaji main taiyaar kiya or isamen muslim pratinidhiyon, muslim mahilaon or muslim saansadon kii koi raay nahin lee gai
 Her biggest opposition is that the triple talaq law can be misused because if a woman accuses her husband that she has said triple talaq, she may have to face jail without any evidence
 agar select cameti ke paas bheja gaya bilsarkaar ab is koshish main lagi he ki bill ko select cameti ke paas bhejne se rokane ke liye agar vipaksh ke kuch chote-mote suzav or sanshodhan maanane kii jarurat pade to use maan liya jaae taaki bill jald se jald paas ho sake
 If the Rajya Sabha decides to send this bill to the Select Committee
 tab yah bill bajet satr main hi paas ho sakegaa
 Actress Rakhi Sawant, who is in the news about her impeccable statements and organ performances in Bollywood, has recently given another shocking statement

 Rakhika says, 'if i don't expose then i won't get films, because people like what Jonny Leonkar does
 isliye agar main ang pradarshan nahin karuungi to film kisi or ko mil jaaegi
 Rakheen also said in an interview to a trade newspaper that his life has become very negative due to always being surrounded by controversies

 Due to being in dispute, i do not think any boy will marry me
 lekin mujhe iskaa gam nahin he kyonki main amitabh bachchan or shatrughna sinha kii beti to hum nahin ki mere liye sab aasaan ho
 ' agar aisa hota he to aap intervyuu main 100 fisadi nahin de paaenge

 Although the process of making and breaking records goes on in the cricket world, but some players who make records go by writing chapters
 shaayad usamen yashasvi kaa bhi naam shaamil ho chukaa he
 Who is the person to test the fame? It is said that to make a career in cricket is not a 'game', but if luck is good and the intention is fixed, all is possible
 upi ke bhadohi jile ke rahane yashasvi saal 2011 main ek bada sapana sanjoe mumbai apane chachaa ke paas aae the
 At that time, even uncle did not have the capacity to think of playing cricket in Mumbai because he was also strapped and Yashasvi's housemates too, but Yashasvi had decided that if he has come to Mumbai, he has to do something
 ye bhi padhein- pani puri bechakar cricketer bana ye ladakaamumbai vaale chachaa kaa ghar chota tha to shuru main kisi tarah ek deyari shop main rahane kii jagah bani
 He then started selling Golgappas for his own expenses, but the intention (cricket) that Yashasvi came to Mumbai was not keeping pace
 umr bhi zyada nahin thi, isliye saahas bhi dagamagaa rahaa tha or paison kii kadaki pehle se thi
 Meanwhile in 2013, Yashswi was spotted by a person who came to Mumbai to play cricket like him at Azad Maidan in Mumbai
 us shaks ne bhi mumbai main bahut dhakke khaae the, tangi ko kareeb se dekha tha
 Perhaps that would be the reason why he was best tested for fame
 ye shaks koi or nahin yashasvi ke coach jwaala singh hai

 Jwala said, 'during this time a friend of mine told about Yashasvi that the boy is good, but the gardener is so bad that the road ahead is difficult
 phir maine yashasvi se khud jaakar baat kii or use milane ke liye apane camp main bulaayaa
 The boy was passionate and he came to meet me
 jab main uske halaat se rou-ba-rou hua to mujhe apane vakt kii yaad aa gai
 i also came to Mumbai in 1995 to play cricket, insisting on the Gorakhpur city of UP
 'jwaala bataate hai, 'shuru main thode paise the, to edjust ho gaya, lekin salbhar baad aisi pareshaani ai kuch dinon tak mujhe tent main raat kaatani padi
 Meanwhile, an acquaintance gave him a place to stay in his gym
 main skool cricket main acha kar rahaa tha to mujhe scolership milane lagi, jisase tangi thodi kam hui, lekin injuri or proper gidence na milane kii vajah se mere cricket kaa safar bahut lanbaa nahin rahaa
 During the Vijay Merchant, Cooch Vihar, CK Nayudu Trophy, i got so injured that my career took a break

 input language garmiyon kaa matlab jahaan yuvaaon va bujurgo ke liye tej dhoop, dhul bhari garm hawaaon, umas, sankraman or kai tarah kii bimariyon se judaa he, vahiin bacchon ke liye garmiyaan skool, padhai, teachers, homework in sabhi se aazaadee se judi he
 During the summer holidays, children spend more time in sports, recreation and eating, which makes it difficult for their family to take care of them
 bacchon kii inhen befecri ko dhyaan main rakhte hue indraprastha apollo hospitals ke pedietric gastroentrology ke cancelatent dow
 Vidyut Bhatia has given some easy tips, so that you can take better care of your children
 -garmi se bachein :dhyaan rakhen ki aapkaa baccha dinabhar hydrateed rahe, khelkud or outdoor gatividhiyon main vyast rahane ke dauraan bachche aksar pani pinaa bhul jate hai or ghanton pyaase rahete hai
 For this, give such options to the children, so that the balance of water and electrolyte is maintained in their body
 haalanki pani kaa koi vikalp nahin he, lekin is maukas main nariyal pani, falon ke ras, sritas fal, lassi, chacha or falon kii smudij acha vikalp ho sakate hai
 - Keep the child away from carbonated beverages, they only dehydrate the body, and increases the sugar (sugar) level in the body
 -sahi ahaar par dhyaan den :garmiyon main sahi aahaar bahut mahatvapurn hota he
 In this season, the body needs extra energy, as the temperature increases as the body undergoes metabolic changes
 isliye salaah di jaati he ki tel or vasa se yukt khaadya padaarthon kaa seven na karen
 Seasonal fruits, vegetables and liquids should be consumed in sufficient quantities
 isse bachche din bhar sakriy rah sakate hai
 There are many options available in the summer season like mango, lychee, banana, watermelon, melon, plum and cherry
 -apane aap ko dhakkar rakhen :dhoop sehat ke liye phydemand hoti he, lekin garmiyon main dhoop bahut tej hoti he jo hamen biimaar kar sakati he
 Children can be a victim of dehydration and sunstroke even if they are in strong sunlight for a while
 isse bachane kaa sabase acha tarika he ki din bhar ghar main hi rahen, subah jaldi or shaam ko hi baahar jaaen
 - If it is necessary to go outside, then cover yourself, especially take care of children
 is mausam main kapade bhi aaramdaayak or hawaadaar hone chahie, jo bacchon ko dhoop se surakshit rakh saken
 Use a hat to cover your head in summer
 dhoop ke chashme se aap apni ankhon ko dhul, mitti or garmi se bachaa sakate hai
 - Never lock a child in a car: Many such instances have been seen when children die in a closed car
 mata-pita unhen dhoop se bachaane ke liye car main kuch der band kar ke chale jate hai
 It is important to understand that the temperature increases quickly in a closed area
 car main to aisa or bhi teji se hota he, kyonki car kii body mattl se bani hoti he
 In a short time the car starts heating up like an oven
 bachche ke liye saans lenaa tak mushkil ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, elders with children should also take this caution
 - ghar ke bheetar bhi bacchon kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen :ghar ke bheetar bhi bacchon kaa puraa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he
 Keep giving them water and fluids in between
 dihydration kahin bhi ho saktaa he, ghar ke bheetar bhi taapmaana achaanak bad jaataa he
 - Be aware of allergies and seasonal changes: In summer, the risk of malaria, dengue, chikungunya increases
 isi tarah pilia, twachaa rogon or diaria kii sambhaavna bhi bad jaati he
 In such a situation, it is important that children are protected from mosquitoes
 moscuto rapelent kaa istemaal karen, bacchon ko puri baaju ke kapade pahanaaen or anti moscuto ptch yaa gel istemaal karen
 Take care during summer sports: swimming or other sports like cricket, football, badminton etc
 khel ke dauraan apane aap ko dhoop se surakshit rakhana or khub pani pinaa jaruri he
 Summer care kit: Prepare a summer care kit, keep the child engaged in activities indoors
 is kit main glucose, oares, pani kii bottle, topi, dhoop kaa chashma, note book or garmiyon ke liye vishesh nirdesh hone chahie
 Also all things like 'what to do' and 'what not to do' and 'contact numbers for emergencies' should also be there

 com / btxtask1zz— RSS (@rssorg)june 7, 2018 Sahara Supremo Subrata Royko has not been relieved by the Supreme Court
 court ne guuruuvaar ko jamaanat par faisla surakshit rakh liya
 The court told Sahara's lawyer Kapil Sibal that the bank guarantee given by them would not be accepted until the future 'roadmap' of payment was cleared on their behalf
 subrat roy ke vakil kapil sibbal ne jamaanat kii evaj main bank guarantee kaa ek draft court main pesh kiya tha, lekin use sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 Remember that Subrata Roy is serving a sentence in Sethihad jail for about a year
 inakam tex vibhaag ke vakil ne court ko bataaya ki sahaara par 7595 karod rupee kii lendaree he
 Apart from this, he also has to pay an interest of Rs 82 crore
 isse pehle isi saal 23 march ko supreme court ne sahaara samooh ko subrat roy or do nideshkon ko jail se reeha karaane ke liye 10 hajaar karod rupee jutaney kii antim mohalat di thi
 The amount will be used to make partial payments to investors, which Sahara Group companies raised from investors in 2008-09 through alternative convertible debentures (ofcds)

 The Sikri bench had also allowed Sahara to sell some more assets in the country, so as to bridge the gap between the amount received from Hong Kong-based Nuam Financial Consultants and the payment made as per the court order
 nuam financial servisis se milane vaali raashi ke baad bhi company ko 650 karod rupee jutaney the or uske liye sahaara ko desh bhar main maujuud uski 10 sampattiyon ko bechney kii anumati mili thi
 If the amount was not met even after selling these 10 properties, the court allowed Sahara to sell his Amby Valley property as well
 court ne 26 march, 2014 ke aadesh kaa paalan karne ke liye sabhi tarah ke vikalpon kii talash karne ke liye sahaara ko teen maheene kaa samay diya tha
 The court had said that if Sahara would not be able to raise Rs 5,000 crore in cash and a bank guarantee of the same amount, then a government manager would be appointed to raise that amount by selling Sahara's property
 supreme court ne 30 agast, 2012 ko sahaara kii do companiyon- esaiaraisiel or esechaisiel- ko nirdesh diya tha ki ve niveshkon ko 17,400 karod rupee 15 fisadi byaaj ke saath waapas karen, jo un companiyon ne 2008-09 main oefasidi ke jariye jutai thi

 is do din kii yatra ke baad na sirf asia balki puraa vishwa baariki se post mortem karegaa
 Before Asia and the world, a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at the Bangabandhu Convention Center of Dhaka University started postmortem on Twitter
 twitor kii duniya kii hashtag sena ke kai rup hote hai
 Many times its rein is with a built army, sometimes a part of the public on Twitter turns into a hashtag army and makes its jumla trend in praise or criticism
 twitor kii bhashaa main ise trol kehete hai
 In one of his long speeches, the Prime Minister said in one place that it is a matter of happiness that 'despite being a woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, she is saying on the injury of Danke that i have zero tolerance in relation to terrorism
 main shaikh hasina ji kaa abhinandan karata hum jo himmat ke saath yah kah rahi hai ki tetarysm ke saath meraa zero tolerance he
 The hashtag became an army on the bus tweeter and this part of the Prime Minister's speech called # despitebeingawoman was criticized
 mazaaq udaaya jane laga
 i will present some samples of this to you
 swati chaturvedi (@bainjal) likhti hai, subah uthne or naashtaa karne main safal rahi # despitebeingawoman Durga Nandini (@nandinidurga) writes, Despite being a woman, i am alive and breathing in this country
 apane aap main badi uplabdhi he
 Arpita Das (@yodakinthestore) writes, does the Prime Minister want to say that we women continue to tolerate terrorism
 # despitebeingawoman The Prime Minister has also praised the position of women in Bangladesh at many places
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki panchi, pawan or pani ko visa kii zarurat nahin padati
 If the poets within them started changing the formulas of diplomacy on this basis, then Pakistan and China would get excited sitting at home
 yahaan aapako samajhnaa chahie ki unhone kitni chaturaai se tista par unke bayaan kaa intazaar kar rahe bangladesh ko sakaaratmak sandesh diya or kinaaraa bhi kar liya
 Apart from this he said that he has an emotional attachment with Bangladesh
 bangladesh kii manyata ke liye jansangh ne jab satyagrah chalaaya, tab usamen bhaag lene kaa mauka mila
 This was Narendra Modi's first political activity
 modi ne bangladesh kii aarthik or saamaajik maanakon par pragati kii khub tarif kii
 Said that Bangladesh's GDP is growing at the rate of 6 percent, it is also a pleasure for India
 apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne bangladesh ke nirmaan main bharat kii bhoomika kaa zikr kiya to bangladesh kaa maan bhi badhaayaa
 He also targeted Islamabad from Dhaka
 pakistan kaa naam to nahin liya lekin kaha ki hamane jin 90 hazaar logon ne bangladesh ke nagarikon par zulm kiya tha aise 90 hazaar pakistani sainik bharat ke paas the
 But look at the character of India, see the character of the army of India, we did not use the land of Bangladesh to fire on Pakistan
 hamane 90 hazaar sainik lautaa die
 After this, India should open avenues for permanent membership of the United Nations
 pradhanmantri modi jahaan bhi jate hai, vahaan sanyukt raashtra kii sthaayee sadsyta ko kaaphi aakraamak tareeke se uthaa rahe hai
 He said that in the Second World War, for whom more than 15 lakh soldiers of India fought and died
 bangladesh ke bhi bachche the jinhone dwitiya vishwayuddh main balidaan die
 Even today, the United Nations says that if the Peace Keeping Force is the best work in it, then the Indian Army belongs to it
 uske baavjood bhi suraksha parishad main permanent seat ke liye bharat ko tarasna padataa he
 On the land of another country, can it be said that India is craving
 pradhanmantri baar-baar kah rahe the ki garib desh hone ke kaaran nobel prize nahin miltaa
 So far, 11 people from India have received the Nobel Prize
 in donon deshon kaa raashtragan likhane vaale rabindranath tagaur ko 1913 main nobel prize mila tha
 Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh received the Nobel Prize in 2006 due to the model of Grameen Bank
 isi saal bharat ke kailash satyaarthee or pakistan kii malala ko sanyukt rup se shanti kaa hi nobel puraskaar mila he
 The Prime Minister said that he never wants to go to Navakhali, where the museum of Mahatma Gandhi is built
 baapu kaa ashram he, kabhi navakhli chalaa jaaun
 Gandhi's visit to Nawakhali burning in Hindu Muslim riots and peace there is a great moment for Gandhi's experiments
 noakhli main hi ahimsa kaa unka siddhant apane charam par pahunchataa he
 Modi must have been giving a message to someone, expressing his desire to go there
 har lihaaz se bangladesh kaa daura kaamyaab he
 The land boundary agreement is historic, now ships between Bangladesh and India will not have to travel for forty days
 saat dinon main hi bharat kaa jahaaz chitagong or mangala port par pahunch jayega, jise china ne viksit kiya he
 Bangladesh is happy that apart from Pakistan and China, we are also seeing India as a neighbor
 bangladesh ke akhabaaron main pradhanmantri kii khub tarif ho rahi he
 Some people in India said that by comparing the land boundary dispute with the Berlin Wall, they have shown their weak history realization
 is sambandh main unka bayaan is prakaar tha- maine aaj yahaan ek main yahaan kii kisi ek riter ne likhaa tha main puraa to pard nahin paaya hum, lekin ek hedline padhi unhone bangladesh or bharat ke zamin ke samjhaute ko berlin kii diwaar girane kii ghatana se tulana kii he
 i say they have kept up with great thinking

 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that the Prime Minister in his speech did not even name Indira Gandhi in the construction of Bangladesh
 narendra modi ne yah kahkar ki hamane chhod die, hamane faisla kar diya bharat ko sharmasaar kiya he
 Even when the Prime Minister was receiving the award for Vajpayeeji, he did not feel ashamed that i have come as the Prime Minister of India, Indiraji was the Prime Minister of India, i should remember him
 ye anand sharma ke shabd hai
 Anand Sharma said that the Land Boundary Act brought the UPA in 2011 but the BJP protested
 is baar bhi ye samjhauta nahin hota agar congress ne sahyog nahin kiya hota
 Both videos of whats-app Sushma Swaraj are running, in which she protests a year ago and support a year later
 tippaniyan The Congress said that when Manmohan Singh went to Bangladesh as Prime Minister, he had taken all the Chief Ministers of the Northeast with him for this agreement
 is baar unka tiraskaar kiya gaya he
 In September 2011, Manmohan Singh accompanied the Chief Minister of four northeastern states, this time only to Mamata Banerjee
 2011 main manmohan singh ke daure par indira gandhi ko bangladesh kaa sarvocch sammaan bangladesh swadhinata sammaan mila tha
 Next comes the Bangladesh Liberation War Award, which was conferred on President Pranab Mukherjee in 2013 and this time to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 2012 main bangladesh ne 52 bharatiyon ko mukti yuddh sammaan or mukti yuddh maitri sammaan diya tha
 Anand Sharma could have said that the Prime Minister could have taken the name of President Pranab Mukherjee in place of Indira
 vaise congress ne bhaashan kii aalochana kii he, daure main jo bharat ne hasil kiya he uski nahin
 Twitter has many variations of the world's hashtag army
 kai baar isaki lagaam ek bani banaai sena ke paas hoti he to kai baar twitor par maujuud janata kaa ek hissaa hashtag sena main badal jaataa he or tarif yaa aalochana main apane jumale ko trend kara detaa he
 In the language of Twitter, it is called a troll
 pradhanmantri ne apane lambey bhaashan main kisi ek jagah kah diya ki khushi kii baat he ki 'bangladesh kii pradhanmantri mahila hone ke baavjood bhi danke ke chot par kah rahi he ki terarysm ke sambandh main meraa jiro tolerance he

 The Prime Minister said that birds, wind and water do not require a visa
 unke bheetar kaa kavi is aadhaar par kootneeti ke formule badalane laga to phir pakistan or china ghar baithe utsahit ho jaaenge
 Here you should understand how cleverly he gave a positive message to Bangladesh waiting for his statement on Teesta and also took the edge

 Arpita Das (@yodakinthestore) writes, does the Prime Minister want to say that we women continue to tolerate terrorism
 # despitebeingawoman The Prime Minister has also praised the position of women in Bangladesh at many places
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki panchi, pawan or pani ko visa kii zarurat nahin padati
 If the poets within them started changing the formulas of diplomacy on this basis, then Pakistan and China would get excited sitting at home
 yahaan aapako samajhnaa chahie ki unhone kitni chaturaai se tista par unke bayaan kaa intazaar kar rahe bangladesh ko sakaaratmak sandesh diya or kinaaraa bhi kar liya
 Apart from this he said that he has an emotional attachment with Bangladesh
 bangladesh kii manyata ke liye jansangh ne jab satyagrah chalaaya, tab usamen bhaag lene kaa mauka mila
 This was Narendra Modi's first political activity
 modi ne bangladesh kii aarthik or saamaajik maanakon par pragati kii khub tarif kii
 Said that Bangladesh's GDP is growing at the rate of 6 percent, it is also a pleasure for India
 apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne bangladesh ke nirmaan main bharat kii bhoomika kaa zikr kiya to bangladesh kaa maan bhi badhaayaa
 He also targeted Islamabad from Dhaka
 pakistan kaa naam to nahin liya lekin kaha ki hamane jin 90 hazaar logon ne bangladesh ke nagarikon par zulm kiya tha aise 90 hazaar pakistani sainik bharat ke paas the
 But look at the character of India, see the character of the army of India, we did not use the land of Bangladesh to fire on Pakistan
 hamane 90 hazaar sainik lautaa die
 After this, India should open avenues for permanent membership of the United Nations
 pradhanmantri modi jahaan bhi jate hai, vahaan sanyukt raashtra kii sthaayee sadsyta ko kaaphi aakraamak tareeke se uthaa rahe hai
 He said that in the Second World War, for whom more than 15 lakh soldiers of India fought and died
 bangladesh ke bhi bachche the jinhone dwitiya vishwayuddh main balidaan die
 Even today, the United Nations says that if the Peace Keeping Force is the best work in it, then the Indian Army belongs to it
 uske baavjood bhi suraksha parishad main permanent seat ke liye bharat ko tarasna padataa he
 On the land of another country, can it be said that India is craving
 pradhanmantri baar-baar kah rahe the ki garib desh hone ke kaaran nobel prize nahin miltaa
 So far, 11 people from India have received the Nobel Prize
 in donon deshon kaa raashtragan likhane vaale rabindranath tagaur ko 1913 main nobel prize mila tha
 Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh received the Nobel Prize in 2006 due to the model of Grameen Bank
 isi saal bharat ke kailash satyaarthee or pakistan kii malala ko sanyukt rup se shanti kaa hi nobel puraskaar mila he
 The Prime Minister said that he never wants to go to Navakhali, where the museum of Mahatma Gandhi is built
 baapu kaa ashram he, kabhi navakhli chalaa jaaun
 Gandhi's visit to Nawakhali burning in Hindu Muslim riots and peace there is a great moment for Gandhi's experiments
 noakhli main hi ahimsa kaa unka siddhant apane charam par pahunchataa he
 Modi must have been giving a message to someone, expressing his desire to go there
 har lihaaz se bangladesh kaa daura kaamyaab he
 The land boundary agreement is historic, now ships between Bangladesh and India will not have to travel for forty days
 saat dinon main hi bharat kaa jahaaz chitagong or mangala port par pahunch jayega, jise china ne viksit kiya he
 Bangladesh is happy that apart from Pakistan and China, we are also seeing India as a neighbor
 bangladesh ke akhabaaron main pradhanmantri kii khub tarif ho rahi he
 Some people in India said that by comparing the land boundary dispute with the Berlin Wall, they have shown their weak history realization
 is sambandh main unka bayaan is prakaar tha- maine aaj yahaan ek main yahaan kii kisi ek riter ne likhaa tha main puraa to pard nahin paaya hum, lekin ek hedline padhi unhone bangladesh or bharat ke zamin ke samjhaute ko berlin kii diwaar girane kii ghatana se tulana kii he
 i say they have kept up with great thinking
 yahi ghatana duniya ke kisi or bhu-bhaag main hoti to vishwa main badi charchaa ho jaati pataa nahin, nobel prize dene ke raste khole jate hamen koi nahin poochhega kyon ham garib desh ke log hai
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that the Prime Minister in his speech did not even name Indira Gandhi in the construction of Bangladesh
 narendra modi ne yah kahkar ki hamane chhod die, hamane faisla kar diya bharat ko sharmasaar kiya he
 Even when the Prime Minister was receiving the award for Vajpayeeji, he did not feel ashamed that i have come as the Prime Minister of India, Indiraji was the Prime Minister of India, i should remember him
 ye anand sharma ke shabd hai
 Anand Sharma said that the Land Boundary Act brought the UPA in 2011 but the BJP protested
 is baar bhi ye samjhauta nahin hota agar congress ne sahyog nahin kiya hota
 Both videos of whats-app Sushma Swaraj are running, in which she protests a year ago and support a year later
 tippaniyan The Congress said that when Manmohan Singh went to Bangladesh as Prime Minister, he had taken all the Chief Ministers of the Northeast with him for this agreement
 is baar unka tiraskaar kiya gaya he
 In September 2011, Manmohan Singh accompanied the Chief Minister of four northeastern states, this time only to Mamata Banerjee
 2011 main manmohan singh ke daure par indira gandhi ko bangladesh kaa sarvocch sammaan bangladesh swadhinata sammaan mila tha
 Next comes the Bangladesh Liberation War Award, which was conferred on President Pranab Mukherjee in 2013 and this time to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 2012 main bangladesh ne 52 bharatiyon ko mukti yuddh sammaan or mukti yuddh maitri sammaan diya tha
 Anand Sharma could have said that the Prime Minister could have taken the name of President Pranab Mukherjee in place of Indira
 vaise congress ne bhaashan kii aalochana kii he, daure main jo bharat ne hasil kiya he uski nahin

 This was Narendra Modi's first political activity

 The Prime Minister said that he never wants to go to Navakhali, where the museum of Mahatma Gandhi is built

 vaise congress ne bhaashan kii aalochana kii he, daure main jo bharat ne hasil kiya he uski nahin
 In his speech, the Prime Minister mentioned the role of India in the creation of Bangladesh and also enhanced the value of Bangladesh
 dhaka se unhone islamabad par bhi nishaanaa saadh liya
 Pakistan did not name it, but said that 90 thousand Pakistani soldiers who had oppressed the citizens of Bangladesh were with India
 lekin hindustan kaa charitra dekhie, hindustan kii sena kaa charitra dekhie, hamane bangladesh kii dharti kaa upyog pakistan par goliyaan chalaane ke liye nahin kiya
 We returned 90 thousand soldiers
 iske baad bharat ko sanyukt raashtra kii sthaayee sadsyta ke liye raste khul jane chahie
 Wherever Prime Minister Modi goes, he is aggressively raising the permanent membership of the United Nations
 unhone kaha ki dwitiya vishwayudd main 15 lakh se bhi zyada hindustan kii fouj kiske liye ladi or mari
 Bangladesh also had children who sacrificed in World War II
 aaj bhi sanyukt raashtra kahata he ki pis keeping force usamen agar sabase uttam kaam he to bharat kii sena kaa hota he
 Despite that, India is longing for a permanent seat in the Security Council
 duusare desh kii zamin par kya yah kaha ja saktaa he ki bharat taras rahaa he
 The Prime Minister was repeatedly saying that being a poor country does not earn the Nobel Prize
 abhi tak bharat ke 11 logon ko nobel puraskaar mil chukaa he
 Rabindranath Tagore, who wrote the national anthem of these two countries, received the Nobel Prize in 1913
 bangladesh ke mohammad younus ko gramin bank ke model ke kaaran 2006 main nobel prize mila tha
 This year, Kailash Satyarthi of India and Malala of Pakistan jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kabhi man karata he ki navakhli jaaun, jahaan mahatma gandhi kaa musium bana hua he
 Bapu has an ashram, should i ever go to Navakhali
 hindu muslim dange main jal rahe navakhli main gandhi kaa janaa or vahaan shanti kaayam karnaa gandhi ke prayogon kaa shandaar lamhaa he
 His doctrine of non-violence reaches its peak in Noakhali itself
 modi vahaan jane kii ichha zaahir kar kisi ko to sandesh de hi rahe honge
 The Bangladesh tour is successful in every respect
 bhoomi seemaa samjhauta aitihaasik to he, ab bangladesh or bharat ke bich jahaazon ko chalis din kaa safar nahin karnaa hoga
 Within seven days, India's ship will reach Chittagong and Mangla Port, which has been developed by China
 bangladesh khush he ki bharat ko padosi ke rup main pakistan or china ke alaava ham bhi nazar aane lage hai
 The Prime Minister is being praised in Bangladesh's newspapers
 bharat main kuch logon ne kaha ki bhoomi seemaa vivaad kii tulana berlin diwaar se kar unhone apane kamazor itihaas bodh kaa parichay diya he
 His statement in this regard was as follows - i wrote one of the writers here today, i have not been able to read the whole, but i read a headline that they have signed the land agreement of Bangladesh and India with the fall of the Berlin Wall
 Have compared
 main kahata hum unhone badi soch ke saath rakhaa he
 If the same incident had happened in any other part of the world, it would have been a big discussion in the world, no one will ask us why the people of poor country are opened
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main bangladesh ke nirmaan main indira gandhi kaa naam tak nahin liya
 Narendra Modi has embarrassed India by saying that we have given up
 pradhanmantri jab vaajapeyi ji ke liye award grahan kar rahe the, tab bhi unhen lajja nahin ai ki main bharat ke pradhanmantri ke rup main aayaa hum, indira ji bharat kii pradhanmantri thim main unako samaran karun
 These are the words of Anand Sharma
 anand sharma ne kaha ki land boundry act 2011 main upie lekar ai thi lekin bijepi ne virodh kiya
 This time also this agreement would not have happened if the Congress had not cooperated
 whats-ap sushma swaraj kaa donon video chal rahaa he, jisamen ve ek saal pehle virodh karti hai or ek saal baad samarthan
 The comments congress ne kaha ki jab pradhanmantri ke rup main manmohan singh bangladesh gaye the is samjhaute ke liye to apane saath purvottar ke sabhi mukhyamantri ko lekar gaye the
 This time he has been despised
 sintabar 2011 main manmohan singh ke saath purvottar ke chaar rajyon ke mukhyamantri gaye the, is baar sirf mamata banerjee gayi thim
 During Manmohan Singh's visit in 2011, Indira Gandhi received Bangladesh's highest honor Bangladesh Independence Award
 iske baad aata he, bangladesh mukti yuddh sammaan jo 2013 main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko or is baar atal bihari vaajapeyi ko diya gaya he
 In 2012, Bangladesh had conferred the Mukti War Honor and the Mukti War Friendship Award to 52 Indians
 anand sharma kah sakate the ki pradhanmantri indira kii jagah raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kaa naam to le hi sakate the
 Although the Congress has criticized the speech, not what India has achieved in the tour
 pradhanmantri modi jahaan bhi jate hai, vahaan sanyukt raashtra kii sthaayee sadsyta ko kaaphi aakraamak tareeke se uthaa rahe hai
 He said that in the Second World War, for whom more than 15 lakh soldiers of India fought and died
 bangladesh ke bhi bachche the jinhone dwitiya vishwayuddh main balidaan die

 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that the Prime Minister in his speech did not even name Indira Gandhi in the construction of Bangladesh
 narendra modi ne yah kahkar ki hamane chhod die, hamane faisla kar diya bharat ko sharmasaar kiya he

 Within seven days, India's ship will reach Chittagong and Mangla Port, which has been developed by China
 bangladesh khush he ki bharat ko padosi ke rup main pakistan or china ke alaava ham bhi nazar aane lage hai
 The Prime Minister is being praised in Bangladesh's newspapers

 The Likud Party of incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently trailing by one seat and has a total of 31 seats
 vahiin vipakshi netaa baini gantz kii kahole leven ek seat aage yani kul 32 siton par kabja jamaaye hue hai
 However, the counting of votes is still in the final stages and the votes of army personnel are being counted at this time
 isroyal main 17 sitambar ko aam chunaav ke liye matdaan hua tha
 The counting began there on Wednesday afternoon, which is still continuing
 guuruuvaar dopaher tak jo ginati hui he, usamen abhi tak kisi party ko bahumat miltaa nahin dikh rahaa he
 According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, a total of 91 percent of the votes have been counted so far
 sansad kii kul 120 seat main se 32 siton par baini gantz kii kahole leven, 31 siton par benjamin netanyahu kii likud party aage chal rahi he
 Talking about the alliance, the Netanyahu-led coalition has 55 seats and the Benny Gantz coalition has a total of 56 seats
 iske alaava secular yisarael betenu party ne 9 siton par jeet darj kii he
 The leader of the Yisrael Betenu party and former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman may become the kingmaker in this election
 agsit pole main bhi aisa hi daawa kiya gaya tha
 Let me tell you that before the general elections were held in Israel in April also, some similar circumstances were created
 benjamin netanyahu tab sansad main bahumat sabit nahin karvaa paae the, yahi kaaran he ki vahaan par 6 maheene ke andar dobaaraa chunaav hue hai
 If you talk about this time now, no one has got a majority yet, if a unity government, ie, a mixed government of the opposition is formed, then there can be a problem on the issue of majority
 agar chunaa gaya pradhanmantri bahumat sabit nahin kar paata he to isroyal ek baar phir chunaav kii ore ja saktaa he

 punjab ke panipat main ek parivaar main do betiyon kii shaadi thi
 a daughter's procession came, but the second daughter who became a bride, kept waiting
 kyonki duusari baraat ai hi nahin
 In fact, one of the two brides who brought the wedding procession fled with his girlfriend two days before the wedding
 jaankaree ke mutabik, yah ajeebogareeb ghatana panipat kii kashyap colony kii he
 Here in Kashyap Colony, the family of a poor father of two daughters lives on rent
 garib pita kii donon betiyon kii shaadi honi thi
 One of these daughters was married to a man named Sajid, a resident of Saudapur village on Jatal Road
 shaadi vaale din ek beti kii baraat to ai, lekin saudapur se aane vaali baraat pahunchi hi nahin
 Just hours before the wedding, the boys sent information that the bridegroom refused
 lekin sachai kuch or hi thi
 Actually, Sajid was already having a love affair with a married woman
 aakhirkaar jab uski shaadi tay ho gai to donon premiyon ne bina gharavaalon ko bataae chupchaap bhaagane kaa faisla kiya
 And just two days before Sajid's wedding, the mother of 3 escaped with his girlfriend
 shaadi se pehle duulhe ke faraar hone kii baat jab ladki parivaar waalon ko pataa chalaa to ve ladke ke gharavaalon se milane pahunche
 He spoke to Sajid's family
 donon parivaar waalon ne vichaar vimarsh ke baad aakhirkaar faisla kiya ki sajid kii jagah ab sajid ke chote bhai sahil se ladki kii shaadi kii jaaegi
 The girl's family members returned after compromising
 nikaah main maatr ek hi din bachaa tha, isliye majabuuran ladki ke parijanon ko sajid ke chote bhai se hi ladki kaa nikaah padhwane kii baat manani padi
 Sahil also agreed to marry
 lekin ghar se bhaag chuke sajid ko jab yah baat pataa chali to vah ghar waapas laut aayaa or kaha ki duulhaa to main hi banuunga or sahil ke saath rishta nahin hone duungaa
 After Sajid's return, the boys again called the girl and again started talking to Sajid to teach nikah
 lekin madhyasthata karne vaale samaaj ke pratishthit logon ne hi is baar is shaadi par aapatti jataa di
 He alleged that the boys have made Nikah a game of dolls
 unhone ladki ke saath nikaah ko majaak banaakar rakh diya he or ab yah nikaah nahin ho saktaa
 This time, there was no agreement between the boy and the girl side and the relationship broke down a few hours before marriage
 udhar dulhan bani ladki ke sapane bhi tut gaye
 Now the girl says that she needs justice
 uske maa-baap ne apni kamai hui sari daulat nikaah karwaane par laga di he
 Now when there is no marriage, at least their blood and sweat should be earned back

 ' tait ne van-de or test cricket se sanyas le liya he
 He said that he was very happy with the last wicket of Tendulkar in the 2011 World Cup match against India

 The 2011 World Cup was my last match against India
 isi main maine unhen antim baar out kiya tha
 He scored 50 runs in that match and India beat us
 lekin mere liye unka wicket chatkaana hameshaa yaadgaar rahegaa
 ' pakistan ke ek ucch nyaayalay ne shuukravaar ko raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ko adaalat kii avmaananaa maamle main doshi qaraar dene main asamarthta prakat kii
 The High Court defied its own order in a case related to Zardari's two terms, saying he, as President, was entitled to be acquitted of the charge
 samachar patr don ke anusaar, adaalat kii avmaananaa maamle se sambandhit yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan shuukravaar ko lahore ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish umr ata bandiyaal ne kaha ki adaalat haalanki avmaananaa karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko doshi qaraar de sakati he, lekin samvidhan ke anuchhed 248(2) ke tahat raashtrapati ko aropamukt kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 The Lahore High Court was hearing a contempt petition against President Zardari for contempt of court, stating that he has not left the political post in the light of the judgment given by this court last year
 yachikakarta ke vakil eke dogaar ne kaha ki ucch nyaayalay or sarvocch nyaayalay adaalat kii avmaananaa karne vaale ko doshi qaraar de sakate hai
 The lawyer questioned the concept of exonerating the President and asked what could happen if the President killed someone
 yachikakarta ne kaha ki yadi raashtrapati ko doshi qaraar nahin diya jaataa he or adaalat kii avmaananaa karne kii sajaa unhen nahin sunai jaati he to isse swatantra nyaaypalika kii avadharana ko batta lagegaa
 To this the court bench said that although the head of the nation is not liable to any person, he is bound to respect and obey judicial orders
 paanch sitambar ko khandpeeth ne raashtrapati jaradaari ko ek nayaa notice jari kar jawaab talab kiya tha
 The petition argued that contempt proceedings be initiated against the President in violation of the court order
 tippaniyan Significantly, Zardari is the co-chairman of the ruling Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and his son Bilawal Bhutto is the president of the Zardari party
 yachika main aarope lagaaya gaya he ki raashtrapati jaradaari desh ke sarvocch pad par rahete hue raajnneetik gatividhiyon main lipt hai
 It is said that despite the judgment given by the full bench of the Lahore High Court against the double post, the President has neither disassociated himself from the political post nor stopped 'misusing' Rashtrapati Bhavan
 ucch nyaayalay ne jaradaari ke do padon par asin rahane sambandhi ek maamle main apane hi aadesh ko dhata bataate hue kaha ki vah raashtrapati hone ke naate aarope se bari hone ke hakdaar hai
 According to the newspaper Dawn, during the hearing of the petition related to the contempt of court, on Friday, the Chief Justice of Lahore High Court Omar Ata Bandial said that although the court can convict any person who is contempt, the Article of the Constitution 248 (2) provides for the discharge of the President
 lahore ucch nyaayalay raashtrapati jaradaari ke khilaaf adaalat kii avmaananaa sambandhi jis yachika kii sunwaayee kar rahaa tha, usamen kaha gaya he ki isi adaalat dwaara pichley varsh die gaye faisle ke alok main unhone raajnneetik pad nahin choda he
 The petitioner's counsel AK Dogar said that the High Court and the Supreme Court can convict the contemptor of the court
 vakil ne raashtrapati ko aropamukt kiye jane kii avadharana par sawaal uthaaya or poocha ki agar raashtrapati kisi kii hatya kar de tab us sthiti main kya ho saktaa he
 The petitioner said that if the President is not convicted and sentenced to contempt of court, he will discount the concept of an independent judiciary
 is par adaalat kii khandpeeth ne kaha ki raashtra kaa pramukh haalanki kisi vyakti ke prati uttaradaayi nahin he, phir bhi vah nyaayik adeshon kaa sammaan or paalan karne ke liye baadhya he
 On September 5, the bench summoned a reply by issuing a fresh notice to President Zardari
 yachika main daleel di gai thi ki adaalat ke aadesh kii avhelnaa par raashtrapati ke khilaaf avmaananaa kaarywahi shuru kii jaae

 But rarely do we try to know whether what we speak has a definite term or not
 angreji main paristhiti ke anusaar kahe gaye vaakyon ke liye kai terms hai
 Today we are going to tell you about 6 such terms
 1: monalogyah aisi spich yaa baat hoti he jisamen koi vyakti apane man kii baat ko tej aawaaj main yaa chillaakar vyakt karata he
 Sometimes it is also called from another person
 udhaaharan- diwaar film main mandir ke andar kaa vah seen jisamen amitabh bachchan bhagwaan se baat karte hai
 2: Analogy: It is a matter of establishing uniformity between two subjects based on uniformity
 udhaaharan- just as a sword is the weapon of a warrior, a pen is the weapon of a writer
 3: Hyperbole is an attempt to highlight an object or a feature of a sentence
 udhaaharan- He is as skinny as a toothpick
 4: Allusion It is said about a place, person or thing, whether it is Kalpanic or real
 is dauraan jo rifrence diya jaataa he vah saamne vaale ko apni baat samajhane kaa tarika hota he
 Example- you are a solomon when it comes to making decisions (refers to the wisdom of king solomon) 5: Paradox is used in a sentence when trying to explain the matter more deeply by giving examples of two opposite subjects
 You are going udhaaharan- Deep down,you're really shallow
 6: Ironis is used in many ways but is mainly used for criticism
 udaarahan- She is as polite as a shark

 vahiin, mantriyon se liye ja rahe istifon ko lekar shuukravaar ko kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad or congress netaa randeep surajevaala aamane-saamne aa gaye

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye voting sampann ho chuki he or ab nattejey aane baaki hai
 The results of the exit poll have been released after the election, in which it is said that the BJP alliance is going to get an overwhelming majority
 haalanki, agsit pole ke nattejey jin partiyon ke liye mufeed nahin hai, unke netaa ab vibhinn deshon main agsit pole kii asafalataa ke bare main baat kar rahe hai
 According to him, the results of exit polls in the US in 2016 were not proved correct
 2016 main europea sangh se alag hone ke mudde par britain main janamat sangrah ko lekar lagaae gaye anumaan bhi galat nikle the
 Similarly, the results of the parliamentary elections in Australia last Saturday had also defeated the exit poll, but the elections and projections in these different countries are similar to the exit polls released in India? India Today data The Intelligence Unit investigated these three elections and found that the mode of election in the US and Australia, except for Brexit, is completely different from the Indian election
 bharat main chunaav kaa tarika in deshon ke chunaav ke tareekon se bilkul bhi nahin miltaa
 Secondly, opinion polls and results of these two show that there was a very tough competition among the contestants, where there was little scope for prediction or guess, but this is not the case in India
 yahaan anumaan kii gunjaaish bachi he
 In the United States, Brexit and Australia, the tough combat data intelligence unit examined exit poll data for these three countries found that while all exit polls in India are predicting in the same direction, the US, Brexit and Australia elections are extremely There was close combat, which was difficult to predict
 america aam chunaav 20162016 main hue america aam chunaav main zyaadaatar opinian pole ke nateezon main trump or hillari clinton ke bich popular voton ke bich bahut kam antar kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 ABC News, the well-known agency in Exit Poll, 538, said 71 of Hillary Clinton became president
 4 fisadi sambhaavna he
 The same New York Times upshot serve predicted Clinton had an 85 percent chance of winning
 vahiin princeton ellection consortium ne to apni chunavi ganit ke jariye ye elaan kiya tha ki hillari clinton ke raashtrapati banane kii sambhaavna 99 fisadi he
 In an article dated November 6, 2016, it was also written that "if Hillary does not win, it will be a big surprise", if you look at the election result, Hillary Clinton 48
 5 fisadi or trump ko 46
 With 4 per cent of the votes, Trump was successful in winning elections due to a complex electoral process like the Electoral College System in the US
 haalanki, tab bhi antim nateezon main donon ke bich jeet kaa antar maamuli hi rahaa
 After the results, scientist Sam Wang, who wrote an article on Clinton's victory for the Princeton Election Consortium in New York, said, "these elections were completely dissimilar and not seen in earlier presidential elections
" ’bracit 2016bracit ke chunaav main bhi yahi hua
 There was very little difference in the number of people Britain joined and separated from the European Union
 isliye donon pakshon main kadaa muqabla tha
 On 6 June 2016, 6 opinion polls were conducted
 inamen se ek agrani research kansaltent ‘populas’ ko puraa yakeen tha ki britain european union ke saath rahegaa
 According to him, 55 per cent of the people voted in favor and 45 per cent voted against it, there was a difference of 10% directly between the two
 vahiin do auropinian polane kaha tha ki britain european union se alag ho jayega haalanki unke sample sies ‘populas’ se chote the, magar jeet kaa faasla sirf 1 se 2 fisadi tha
 About 52 per cent voted for Britain to separate and 48 per cent voted to stay together
 lekin yahaan anumaanon or vaastavik nateezon, donon ke bich kaa antar behad kam tha
 Australian Election 2019 The Australian election was held recently and its results were announced last Saturday
 is chunaav ke bare main soshal media par kaaphi charchaa hui
 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor wrote on Twitter that most exit polls in Australia had miscalculated and that exit polls in India on the day of counting would prove to be wrong
 australia ke agsit pole main sabhi agenciyon ne jo anumaan lagaae the, unamem lebar party or libral party ke bich sirf do fisadi voton kaa antar kaa tha
 The leading election survey agency there, Roy Morgan, had claimed that the Labor Party would get 78 seats and would form the government
 australia main voting kaa system bilkul alag he, vahaan do party kaa system he
 Four big exit polls said 52 percent of the vote would go to the Labor Party while 48 percent of the vote would go to the Liberal Party
 vahiin jab nattejey aaye to libral party ko 1 fisadi vot zyada mili
 There are 150 seats in Australia where 76 seats are needed to form a government
 libral ko party ko 77 siten mili hai, yani jaruri siton se maatr ek seat zyada
 It can be understood that here too the competition was thorny
 bhartiya chunaavjaisa america, australia or bracit main hua, bharat main bhi vaisaa hone ke liye is baat kii jarurat hogi ki chunaav lard rahe pratyaashiyon ke bich kadaa muqabla ho, lekin aisa nahin he
 All Indian exit poll agencies have projected a clear majority to the BJP alliance, that too with a margin of around 100 seats
 zyaadaatar baar ye agenciyaan badhat hasil kar rahi party yaa gathbandhan ke bare main anumaan lagane main safal rahi hai
 Even the exit poll agencies of India guess who is going to be the winner, but they often miss guessing about the seat and vote share
 vot share or siton ke maamle main vaa stavik nateezon kai baar bilkul alag ho jate hai
 DIU spoke to the big pollsters of the country who are divided on this issue, for what the results of the opinion poll of experts may be in India
 centre for olicy research ke phelo rahul verma maanate hai ki bharat or australia ke bich tulana karnaa seb or santare ke bich tulana karne jaisaa he
 Varma says, "when a close match takes place, the results can be wrong
" america or australia ke chunaav iske udhaaharan hai, lekin bharat kii sthiti ulat he
 Historically, the rightful winner is announced in India and this time too, the bjp-led alliance is ahead
 ’purv chunavi jaankaar or ab bijepi ke pravaktaa jiviel narsimha raav bhi yahi maanate hai
 "exit polls are prone to disturbances when there is a very close contest
 2019 main hue saare pole endie ko apane virodhiyon se milon aage dikhaa rahe hai, is tarah kii lead saaf ishaara karti hai ki public kaa mood kya he, isamen galati kii gunjaaish nahin he"vahi seepiaar ke ek or jaankaar neelan sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki australia or britain kii tarah bharat main sthiti ho sakati he or 23 may ko nattejey badal sakate hai

 input language odisha main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii reliyaan shuru hone vaali hai
 Jitendra Singh, in charge of Odisha Congress, said that Rahul's first rally will be held in Bhubaneswar on January 25 and he will address several rallies and public meetings every month till the Lok Sabha elections are over
 jis tarah se odisha congress main vidhayakon or duusare netaaon kaa duusari partiyon main jane kaa silsilaa shuru hua usamen rahul kii raily se party main nayaa josh aa saktaa he
 Political experts also say that by handing over the responsibility of UP to Priyanka, Rahul wants to focus more in other states
 phir bhi chunaav taiyaariyon kii baat kii jaae to congress odisha main pichhadati najar aa rahi he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has started its preparations here long back
 haalanki party adhyaksh amit shah abhi chunavi res main peeche hai kyonki unki tabiyat kharaab chal rahi he
 In his place, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown his full power and has visited Odisha thrice in the last 2 months
 atakalein aisi bhi hai ki narendra modi loksabhaa kaa chunaav odisha se lard sakate hai
 The question is that in the Odisha in which BJP has put all its strength, why is the Congress's move so slow? Has the Congress felt that the next election is a 'drowning boat' which is being run away from everyone? As some of the past developments have witnessed, many leaders of the country's ancient party Congress are angry and some have even said goodbye to the party
 is par siyaasi panditon kaa kahana he ki odisha congress main khalabali ek darkate kile kii ore ishaara he kyonki aisa nahin hota to kabhi kendriya mantri rahe or pradesh ke firebrands netaa shrikant jena ko aise baahar kaa rasta nahin dikhaaya jaataa
 Many legislators have left, Jena is not alone among the leaders who have been disbanded from the Congress in Odisha
 nae saal ke is maheene main mahaj 25 din beete hai or congress main khalabali kaa alam yah he ki vidhayak bhi dhadadhad istipha thama rahe hai
 Yogesh Singh and Naba can take the example of Kishore Das
 aisa nahin he ki congress ko in vidhayakon kii 'anushaasahinata' jo abhi dikhi he, vah pehle nahin thi
 Leaders like Jena, Yogesh Singh and Kishore Das had been warning for several days and demanding complete action but Rahul Gandhi could not make time for Odisha
 congress ke 16 vidhayak chune gaye theyah bhi tay he ki rahul gandhi ke party manager odisha kii har ek jaankaree unhen de rahe honge
 They will definitely know the difference between the first and now
 alabatta odisha kii 147 vidhansabha siton main pichley chunaav main congress sirf 16 jhatak pai or 21 sadasyeey loksabhaa main congress kii ek bhi seat nahin aa pai
 It is clear from this that the Congress has already surrendered
 baaki bachi aashaaen isliye maddhim ho rahi hai kyonki pradhanmantri modi ke vahaan se ladane kii atakalein tej hai
 So should we assume that Rahul Gandhi and his party Congress are considering BJD vs BJP in the next Lok Sabha cum Assembly (there is a possibility that both elections are together) elections? The case is similar when the number of Congress mlas is also being reduced
 aisi paristhiti main koi party apane adhyaksh ko haari baaji par daanv bhala kyon lagane degi
 Jena has spoiled Srikanth Jena, a former sports minister and once a staunch Congress leader, has now been expelled from his party
 unki bedakhli jarur hui he magar unke tevar deele nahin pade hai
 The seriousness of this attitude can be gauged from the fact that Jena openly announced that he will put the 'real face' of Rahul Gandhi among the people
 yahaan dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki jena akele nahin gaye, saath main koraput ke vidhayak krishna chandra saagariyaa ko bhi le gaye
 Jena has made serious allegations If we look at the allegations of Jena, then the seriousness of this will be understood and it will also come to know from which turmoil the Odisha Congress is facing
 bakaul jena, 'rahul gandhi ne saaf kar diya he ki ve khanan mafia kaa saath denge
 The Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee, which was once with Utkalamani Gopabandhu Das, is now playing at the hands of the mining mafia
 is bare main hamane rahul gandhi kaa dhyaan kai baar khinchaa lekin unhone gaur nahin kiya
 'jena has cleverly named Gopabandhu Das as Das is called Gandhi of Odisha and this Gandhi of Odisha is not famous as ari-gary, but as a social activist, reformer, political activist, journalist, poet and essayist Has been so, jena ne gopbandhu das vaali congress ko mining mafia congress bataakar ek saath kai nishane daage hai
 Now the Congress does not understand whether to hold an election rally first or to stop the leaders from going
 dharmendra pradhan ade or congress pichad gaiodisha main bijepi kii kya taiyaari he, ise jaanane ke liye kendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan kii gatividhi dekhen
 Pradhan comes from there but despite being in Rajya Sabha, most of his time is spent in Odisha
 unki chhavi svachh he or unke kaam bhi gine ja rahe hai
 Many projects have started in the field of gas, important agreements have been reached with oil-gas oriented countries like Russia
 bijepi ne dur kii kadi ko nihaarte hue pradhan ko kaaphi pehle odisha main set kiya jabaki congress abtak apana koi bada netaa vahaan nahin utaar pai
 Now whether this rally of Rahul will be able to unite the leaders will have to be seen
 gauratlab he ki dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki od-evan formula lagu karwaane ke liye 'aap' ke kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tainaati hogi

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in his interview that it would be a big mistake to believe that Pakistan will improve with a fight
 piem modi ke is bayaan par pratikriya dete hue islamabad ne kaha he ki bharat ko pakistan par apane aakraamak ravaiye main badlaav laane kii jarurat he
 India has seen the result of a war, yet there is no change in its stand, there will be 100 wars, then there will be no change
 pakistani sena ke pravaktaa major general asif gafoor ne samachar channel earai ko die apane intervyuu main kaha ki bharat main chunaav kaa maahaul he
 There elections are held in the name of Pakistan
 lekin pakistan main aisa nahin he
 India has talked about war
 bharat ne ek jang kaa parinaam dekha he phir bhi uske ravaiye main badlaav nahin aayaa, 100 yuddh bhi ho jaae phir bhi nahin aayega
 He said that Pakistan has spoken about peace
 bharat kii dhamkiyon kaa hamaare upar koi asar nahin padataa
 Asif Gafoor said that Pakistan has said many times that one should go towards Aman
 jang kii dhamkiyon se (khaskar pakistan jaisi majboot riyasat par) hal nahin hoga or na kabhi hua he
 Pakistan is capable of defending itself
 bataa den ki sargical strike ke baavjood seemaa paar se sangharsh viraam ke ulanghan hone ke sawaal par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki chaahe 1965 kaa yuddh ho yaa 1971 kaa, ek ladaai se pakistan sudhar jayega, ye sochna bahut badi galati hogi
 Pakistan will take more time to improve
 haalanki pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bharat pakistan se baatcheet ke liye hameshaa taiyaar he, lekin bam or bandook ke shor main baatcheet kii aawaaj nahin suni ja sakati
 Questioning the credibility of the surgical strike once, Pakistan Army spokesman Asif Gafoor said that his own people did not believe, so far India has not provided any evidence, only talk does not lead to a surgical strike

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne somvaar ko 46wein bhartiya shram sammelan ko sambodhit kiya
 He advocated establishing a 'family spirit' among the workers and owners of the country and promised to make the laws comfortable
 pradhanmantri ne kaha kiraashtra nirmaan main shramik kaa yogadaraham he or kisaan-majdoor hi desh ko banaate hai
 The Prime Minister said that the laborer fulfills the dreams of others by sacrificing dreams
 vah dukhi rahegaa to desh kaise sukhi rahegaa
 The Prime Minister said that if family sentiment arises between the employer and the worker, then no one can stop the journey of development
 unhone kaha ki in sari charchaaon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan bhi hona chahie
 He advocated bringing respect to the workers

 After the fall of the VP Singh government in 1990, then President r Venkataraman wanted Pranab Mukherjee to become Prime Minister but Rajiv Gandhi was thinking something else
 yah daawa congress ke varisht netaa or gandhi parivaar ke vafaadaar rahe maakhanlaal photedaar kii kitaab ‘da chinar livj’ main kiya gaya he
 In the book, Fotedar writes that in 1990 when he met President Venkataraman to discuss the political situation in connection with the resignation of VP Singh, the President insisted that Rajiv should support Mukherjee
 rajeev gandhi the sabase bade dal ke netafotedaar ne likhaa he ‘maine raashtrapati venkataramana se mulaakaat kii or raajnneetik sthiti par unke saath charchaa kii
 i told them that in the present situation, only the Congress party can take every section of the society together and give a strong and stable government
 ’ unhone aage likhaa he ‘maine unase aagrah kiya ki vah agali sarkaar kaa netritv karne ke liye rajeev ko aamantrit karen kyonki rajeev loksabhaa main akele sabase bade dal ke netaa the
 To this, the President insisted that i should tell Rajiv Gandhi that if he supports Pranab Mukherjee for the post of Prime Minister, he (president) will administer him the oath of office the same evening
 ’jald aane vaali he kitabaharper colins se prakashit yah kitaab jald hi bazaar main aane vaali he
 The book mentions that until the idea of making Rajiv Gandhi his political successor had not come to Indira Gandhi's mind, she thought that Mukherjee, PV Narasimha Rao and Venkataraman could take over the reins of the Congress party after him
 indira gandhi ke purv sahaayak photedaar ne kitaab main bataaya he ki pradhanmantri pad kii mahatvakanksha paalane vaale madhavrao sindhiya ne varsh 1999 main ek vot se vaajapeyi sarkaar ke girane ke baad congress netritv valigathbandhan sarkaarko samarthan dene ke bare main mulaayam singh yadav kii raay badalane ke liye kis tarah amar singh kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Many Congressmen were from this work of Sonia
 After the fall of the Khafawajpayee government, Fotedar wrote in the book about the name of Manmohan Singh on behalf of Sonia as the prime ministerial candidate, 'when many people in the party came to know that Sonia's first choice was Dr
 singh hai to kuch logon kii tyoriyaan tan gayi or pradhanmantri pad kii mahatvakanksha rakhane vaale madhav raav sindhiya ne congress netritv vaali gathbandhan sarkaar ko samarthan dene ke bare main mulaayam singh yadav kii soch badalane ke liye apane mitra amar singh kaa istemaal kiya
 'he has written' Soniaji was not in electoral politics then
 unhone raashtrapati se mulaakaat kar daawa kiya ki unki party ke paas 272 loksabhaa sadasyon kaa samarthan he
 An interesting incident happened just before his meeting with the President
 sonia ji jo mul patr raashtrapati ko saunpna chaahati thim usamensanket diyagaya tha ki dow
 Manmohan Singh will be the party's prime ministerial candidate
 haalanki maine unhen singh kaa naam hataane kii salaah di or gathbandhan sarkaar kaa netritv karne ke vaaste party ko bulaae jane par jor dene ko kaha
 Soniaji praised this argument and did what was needed
 ’manmohan singh ko PM banane ke peeche yah thi sochpradhanmantri pad ke liye chune gaye sikh congressi manmohan singh ke bare main photedaar ne kaha ki is pasand se sonia gandhi kii ‘chatur rajantik soch’ kaa pataa chalaa kyonki singh kaa koi raajnneetik aadhaar nahin tha or vah unke netritv ke liye kabhi khatra nahin ban sakate the
 At the same time he was associated with the Sikh community which was extremely angry with the Gandhi family due to the riots after Operation Bluestar and the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 unhone kaha ‘yah apane bacchon kii suraksha kii khatir shanti banane ke liye sonia ji kaa tarika tha
