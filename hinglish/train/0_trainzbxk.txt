 He has jumped into the political arena, behaving quite contrary to the dignity of the saints, and is speaking in favor of the BJP or the Congress sometimes for his personal benefit
 ' He informed that in a high-level meeting of the Panchas of Digambar Ani Akhara held in Ujjain, a formal decision was taken to expel Computer Baba from this major religious institution of saints of the Vaishnava sect (hindu Mataavalambi who worshiped Lord Vishnu as their presiding deity)

 He will also not be able to take part in the royal bath and other religious events of this arena at the Kumbh Mela starting on January 15 in Prayagraj (allahabad)

 Narrating the religious rules of the Akharas, Narendra Giri said that after the expulsion, the computer Baba would not be able to attend the programs of Digambar Ani Akhara and the mass feast of its saints
 vah prayagraj (elahabaad) main aagaamee 15 janvari se shuru hone vaale kumbh meley main is akhaade ke shahi snaan or anya dharmik aayojanon main bhi hissaa nahin le sakenge
 On the other hand, after his removal from Digambar Ani Akhara, Computer Baba said in a video statement, 'the BJP government led by Shivraj Singh Chauhan should take as many tactics against me
 par main narmada nadi ke pavitra anchal ko daagdar nahin hone duungaa or gau mata kii durdasha nahin sahuunga
 i will stick to the defense of Hinduism even further

 In response to a question after meeting non-bjp and non-congress political parties, Mamata Banerjee said that when people associated with politics meet, definitely politics will be discussed
 yahaan kuch bhi chipa nahin hai
 The 2019 Lok Sabha election will be very interesting

 ab dekhnaa yah he ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kaa muqabla karne ke liye ekajute partiyaan kahaan tak apane uddeshy main safal hoti hai
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra is well-crossed
 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye siton ke bantwaare ko lekar shivasena ne bijepi ko aakhri formula diya he
 While targeting the BJP, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray also said, 'do not try to let us down again and again if the tussle continues, the army lions are ready
 'haalanki, bijepi ne shivasena ke is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya he
 BJP has said that this decision is impractical
 maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke bich siton ke bantwaare par aaj aar yaa paar kaa din he
 The BJP and Shiv Sena called separate meetings
 bijepi netaa nai dilli main party mukhyalay par rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah se milane pahunche
 The meeting was attended by Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Om Mathur, Vinod Tawde and Devendra Fadnavis
 shaam ko dilli main bijepi chunaav samiti kii meeting bhi honi he
 Earlier, the Shiv Sena Working Committee met at Rang Sharda Auditorium, Mumbai
 isamen uddhav ne bijepi ko do took shabdon main kah diya ki wo shivasena ko nicha dikhaane kii koshish na kare
 Uddhav said, 'we listened to the BJP during the Lok Sabha elections
 sankat ke vakt bala sahib ne bijepi kaa saath diya tha
 This is a fight for our existence
 'kaarysmiti kii baithak main uddhav ne nayaa formula diya jiske mutabik shivasena 151 siton par chunaav ladegi or bijepi ko 119 siton par chunaav ladane ko kaha gaya he
 The formula for giving the remaining 18 seats to 4 other allies has been suggested
 nae formule kii peshkash par uddhav ne kaha ki ye gathbandhan bachaane kii unki aakhri koshish he
 Uddhav also recalled the late BJP leader Gopinath Munde in the meeting
 unhone kaha ki munde ke rahete gathbandhan main sabhi chijen saamaanya taur par hoti thim
 After Uddhav Thackeray's statement, Maharashtra BJP leaders held a press conference in Delhi
 kaha gaya ki gathbandhan main koi aakhri prastaav nahin hota he
 The seats should be face to face, not through TV channels
 bijepi ne yah bhi kaha ki 25 saal purana gathbandhan tootna nahin chahie
 But it also said that the party winning more seats should be the CM
 bijepi ne pehle bhi thukraa diya tha shivasena kaa formulisase pehle samaadhaan kii koshishen kaamyaab nahin ho pai hai
 The meeting of Maharashtra BJP President Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was inconclusive
 bijepi ne shivasena kaa formula thukraa diya or maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh ne der raat uddhav se milakar naaraazgi jataai
 The Maharashtra BJP president gave Uddhav the decision of the BJP Core Committee and rejected the Shiv Sena's proposal
 nae formule main shivasena ne apni 14 siten ghataane kaa prastaav diya tha
 That is, instead of 169 seats, 155 seats were offered to contest
 jabaki bijepi ko 126 siten di gai thi
 Of the 14 seats left of the Shiv Sena, 7 seats will go to the BJP account while the remaining 7 seats will be given to the self-respecting Shetkari organization
 arpiai ko bijepi apane cote kii siten dengi
 This will reduce the bjp's own seat by 119 seats
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ne 2009 main 119 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 This is the reason the BJP has refused to follow the Shiv Sena formula
 mana ja rahaa he ki ab uddhav thakare se bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii baat hogi or seat bantwaare main aae gatirodh ko dur kiya jayega
 There is also a meeting of BJP Parliamentary Party in Delhi today, after which a final decision will be taken

 Everyone will remember Mahendra Singh Dhoni's picture of cheering the World Cup trophy at the Wankhede Stadium four years ago, but very few people know that this star of Indian cricket was once a ticket collector at the Kharagpur railway station
 paan singh or devaki devi ke bete dhoni madhyamvargeey parivaar se sambandh rakhte the or unhen apane cricket kariyar ko aage badhaane ke liye naukari kerani padi thi
 Journalist and writer Vishwadeep Ghosh, in his book 'MSD, the man, the leader', mentions the journey of the Ranchi player to become India's most successful captain
 bihar kii taraf se kooch behaar trophy main under-19 cricket khel chuke dhoni naukari kii khatir pashchim bengal ke khadgpur chale gaye jo bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan (iaiti) or sabase lambey plateform ke liye mashhoor he
 The late Animesh Ganguly, the then Divisional Railway Manager and cricket lover of the South Eastern Railway (SER), was then looking for a train ticket inspector (commonly known as TTE or ticket collector) who could be a cricketer and also play with the SER team
 dhoni ne na sirf titii kii pariksha paas kii, balki vah esaiaar team kaa ahm hissaa bhi ban gaye
 It is difficult to imagine that the Indian captain would have ever checked the tickets, but according to the book, this wicket-keeper batsman not only did his work with complete sincerity, but he also made his mark in Kharagpur by playing tennis ball cricket
 stesan main kai ghante bitaane ke baad dhoni tennis bal cricket khelaa karte the, jise is kshetra main 'khep' kaha jaataa he
 Dhoni used to play at some top clubs and according to reports he used to charge 2000 rupees for every match, but the author says that this star player did not bargain with the organizers
 amuman shant or ekagrachit rahane vaale dhoni ke bare kitaab main likhaa gaya he ki tivi channel badalane ko lekar ek baar dhoni kii apane saathi (rummet) deepak ke saath jhagada ho gaya tha
 The quarrel had grown so much that television was damaged and was defended by another Satyaprakash Krishna, who played a key role in getting Dhoni a job
 dhoni tab sharajah cap match dekhnaa chaah rahe the, jabaki deepak amitabh bachchan kii 'mukaddar kaa sikandar' dekhne main vyast tha
 It seems that this was the only incident of Dhoni off the field during his four-year stay in Kharagpur when he became angry
 iske alaava unki cricket ke charche hi yahaan adhik hote hai

 He said what is the issue that farmers' income doubled or not? Talk about employment, talk about poverty, the way constitutional institutions have been hijacked by Modi ji, i say that all constitutional institutions are acting like bjp's cell
 tejasvi ne kaha ki modi ji ke paas koi mudda nahin he
 Modi ji is talking about radar, talking about internet
 unhone kaha ki jab aap mudde kii baat karoge to BJP rashtrawaad kii baat karenge
 If the income of the farmers increases, then that too is nationalism

 However, the boy's sweat was definitely saved in saving the girl

 The 20-year-old woman, after quarreling with her partner, started hanging from the rope drying clothes on the balcony and threatening to jump from there
 ladki kaa tej-tarraar bwoyfriend jhat se neeche padosiyon ke ghar kii ore bhaaga or usne unase kaha ki ve khidki par jaakar ladki se waapas jane kii guhaar lagaaein
 The witnesses and the neighbors of the apartment kept asking the woman not to do so
 ek pratyakshdarshi ke mutabik, 'kapade sukhaane vaali rassi tut gai or ladki gir gai
 But luckily, the girl's boyfriend caught her and held her until the rescue team reached there

 unhone ladki ko pakade rakhane main ladke kii puri madad kii

 On November 8, when Prime Minister Modi issued the order to discontinue the old notes of 500 and 1000, the most problem was faced by the workers working in the factories who were coming from small cities and working in Delhi
 aise hi ek majudar raju he, jo kapadaa factory main kaam karte hai

 The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh is about to begin
 team india ne kal or aaj taiyaariyon main jamkar pasinaa bahaya
 Light rain continued but the practice of the players did not stop
 yah baat zaahir karne ke liye kaaphi thi ki test series main jo bhi hua ho, vanade main team india kisi bhi tarah se bangladesh ko halke main nahin le rahi or puri gambhirtha se abhyaas kar rahi he
 There is currently a considerable difference in the ICC ODI rankings of the two teams
 is vakt team india 117 ankon ke saath number do par he to bangladesh ke 88 ank hai or vah aathven number par he
 Team India's all-rounder player Suresh Raina believes the same
 raina kehete hai, unke paas aise kai khilaadi hai, jo laajawab lay main hai
 Whether it is Mashrafe Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal or Shakib al-hasan
 ye khilaadi vanade ke maahir he isiilie ham koi chance nahin lenaa chaahate
 Team India and Suresh Raina's concern about Bangladesh is understandable as the Bangladesh team has performed brilliantly in colorful clothes in the last 12 months
 pichley 1 saal main bangladesh ne 19 vanade muqablon main se 11 jite hai, 7 haare hai
 During this time India has won 18 out of 26 and lost 6 matches
 tippaniyan - Bangladesh have eliminated Pakistan 3–0 in their home series in the last series, which has increased the concern of Team India
 vishwa cap ke baad team india kii ye pehali vanade series he, lekin jeet kii bhukh ab bhi utani hi nazar aa rahi he
 Touring Bangladesh a few years ago is often seen as an opportunity for young players to try, but Team India has come out with full force in this series, which clearly explains its seriousness
 donon tiimon kii isisi vanade rankings main philhal kaafii antar he
 At present, Team India is at number two with 117 points, Bangladesh has 88 points and is at number eight
 team india ke harfan maula khilaadi suresh raina kaa bhi yahi maananaa he
 Raina says, he has many players who are in great rhythm
 chaahe mashrafe murtaza hon, tameem iqbaal hon yaa phir shaakib-al-hasan hon
 This player is an expert in odis, that's why we don't want to take any chances
 bangladesh ko lekar team india or suresh raina kii chintaa samaj aati he kyonki pichley 12 maheenon main bangladesh kii team ne rangeen kapadon main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Bangladesh has won 11 of the 19 odis in the last 1 year, losing 7
 isi dauraan bharat ne 26 main se 18 jite hai or 6 mukaable haare hai
 The comments - pichhali series main bangladesh apane ghar main pakistan kaa 3-0 se safaya kar chuke hai, jisase team india kii chintaa or bad gai he
 This is Team India's first ODI series after the World Cup, but the hunger for victory still looks the same

 hamaari choti-choti ankhe bade-bade sapane kab or kaise dekh leti hai, ye kabhi pataa nahin chalata
 After seeing these dreams, heart and mind start in the fight
 aisa hi ek sapana meri ankhon nefaishan dizinerbanane kaa dekha tha
 My name is Komal Pandey and this is about the time when i was studying in Mumbai city
 padhai ke dauraan hi dil main iraadaa kar liya tha ki fishan kii duniya main apana ek mukaam bananaa he
 There was also a time to fulfill this dream, but then the father was transferred to the heart city of Delhi
 beshak ye shahar mujhe pasand thalekin mere sapanom kii gali yahaan se nahin guzarati thi
 Then began to convince mother and father, but i could not succeed in it
 aakhirkaar dilli aana kida lekin jo sapana maine dekha tha, vah mere saath mumbai se dilli aa gaya
 When i came here and talked to my father, the answer was that what is the need to make a mark in the world of fashion, if there is a lot of desire, then take a course from home
 is jawaab se main udhaas hui thi lekin iraade pehle se zyada majboot ho gaye the
 i started my job and while taking full year salary, i took admission in fashion designing course
 maa-papa hairaan the lekin meri mehnat ko dekhakar is baar ve mujhe roak nahin sake
 The other thing that was on my mind was that where i took admission, it was not the place where i had dreamed of taking training
 lekin aasmaan paane ke liye jameen to chahie hoti he, to bas ye vahi jameen thi
 i have now completed my first semester and am pursuing my dream
 bas yahi nahin aj bhi dil main iraadaa puraa he ki ek din jis sapanom ke shahar ne mujhe jate hue roka nahin tha, ek din vahi mujhe bulaaegaa or mere maa-papa bhi ramp par mere hunar ke rangon ko dekhenge

 unka janm 21 sitambar 1979 main hua tha
 He died on 18 November 2018 at a very early age from cancer
 us samay vah mahaj 39 varsh kii thi
 Rajkamal Prakashan has published his book 'from the head of the breathless breath'
 angrezi main yah kitaab 'tels from da tail and : maay cancer diary' spicking tiger prakaashan se pehle hi prakashit ho chuki he
 The books are pages of his diary
 jo unhone cancer jaisi ghaatak bimaari se jujhne ke dauraan likhe hai
 Ananya Mukherjee did not lose her body lost to a disease like cancer
 jab vah apni choti si jindagi main sabase badi ladaai lard rahi thi
 She was neither disappointed nor lost in life then
 vah is choti si jindagi ko badi hi jindadilii se ji rahi thim
 In the words of Ananya Mukherjee, 'when i came to know that i had breast cancer, i could not believe it
 is khabar ne mujhe bheetar tak jhakzor diya
 But, soon i strengthened myself by incorporating my confidence
 main jaanati thi ki sab kuch thik ho jayega
 
 
 'this is reflected in this book
 is kitaab ke shabdon main vah amar ho chuki hai
 Famous actress Manisha Koirala and cricketer Yuvraj Singh, who has battled a deadly disease like cancer, read this book and praised the writer's amazing courage and bravery in fighting cancer in her response
 yuvaraj singh kehete hai, "sharir ke andar beemaari se ladanaa kisi andheri gufa ke bheetar ghuste janaa he, is vishwaas ke saath ki iskaa antim sira raushnee se bharaa hoga

 inamen jo ho rahaa hota tha sadaa gadabad hota tha
 i am in a hurry to board a train but there is no coach with the ticket number written on the ticket or i am running on a platform covered in sweat and the train has gone out of the platform
 main koi karina kapur to thi nahin, na hi shahrukh khan jaise kisi kaa haath pyaar se aage badha
 This was my confidence
 kai baar bechaini se chhutate hue plane kaa sapana dekhati thi, meraa suutakes band hi nahin hota tha
 Or my friend has gone to the bathroom and taken my boarding pass along and does not come back
 shaayad mere boarding paas ko usne toilet paper kii tarah upyog liya hoga or use sharmindagi ho rahi ho
 But in reality nothing like this ever happened
 jab main jaagi hui hoti hum to sadaa un ubaau bengali yatriyon jaisi ho jaati hum jo raat kii yatra ke liye bhari dopahari main stesan yaa airport par pahunch jaaya karte hai
 Check your ticket again and again

 Well, let's talk further
 mere cancer ke ilaaj ko ek varsh ho chukaa tha, to main phir yatraaon ke sapane dekhne lagi
 But this time i had to go almost unconsciously towards the goal, where i had to go through soot water
 in sapanom main mujhe anjaane raaston ko dhundte hue yaa ukhdi or khudi hui keechad bhari sadak par chalanaa padataa tha, jahaan mitti hi mitti hoti thi
 From the top it was often not even known where to go
 aise sapanom se main ghabaraakar uthati to par uljhan-si jarur hoti thi
 Apart from this, some of my loved ones were also involved in these dreams, so what to worry about
 kam se kam main to mast hum or phir se dard se raahat ke liye doctoron ne mujhe morphin tablets deni shuru kar di
 Although there is no evidence in writing about this, it is said that narcotic drugs cause strange or elusive dreams
 mujhe sapana aayaa ki main chamchamaate akaash kii prishthbhumi main uthati kai feet oonchi gahare hare rang kii silk jaisi laharon ko paar kar rahi hum tees feet neeche andheri escalator se mandaraate neeche ja rahi hum or kisi jane-pahachaane parijan ne meraa haath pakad rakhaa he
 Cycling across a wide meadow like the universe, where someone's loud cheering is coming from behind - can you hear the sonic sounds? I'm hanging on the side of a creaking bus, like a bat in the dark night 
 ajanabi logon ke bich kisi anjaane raste par, jahaan driver hamen raste ke bich main utaar detaa he, kuch yatriyon kii aawaaj aati hai, jo agar tum is hare sagar ko paar kar loge to pakistan pahunch jaaoge mere khyaal se narak pahunch jaaoge
 Similar madcap dreams
 par saare sapane itane andhere, itane paagalpan bhare or itani anjaani jagahon ke nahin hote
 Now look, that night i saw my boss giving feedback about my work that both the quality and speed of my work should be improved instantly
 main uthi to kaafii thik mahasoos kar rahi thi
 In many other good dreams, i look up at the lovely Mahafil with big happy, warm-up glamorous people chanting Ravindra Sangeet while drinking fine quality whiskey or beer on a moonlit night
 jahaan laharaate shabd, libaas or laharaate bal hote hai
 i also have hair in my dreams
 pichhali raat maine apni ek badi pyaari, khubasurat or khub paise vaali mitra nikita ko dekha
 Whenever she came to Jaipur from Delhi, half of Amrapali jewelers would buy
 maine dekha ki ham donon saath- saath shopping kar rahe hai or vah jo bhi kharidti he uskaa doosraa pis mujhe miltaa jaataa he
 Just make a mistake that i mentioned this dream to my husband someday
 vah bole ki unhen mere hare samundar ke paar pakistan vaale sapane behatar lage
 In his view, Nikita should come to Jaipur for things other than Amrapali

 His visit was confidential
 jab bhai rahul gandhi kisi dalit ke ghar khaanaa kha sakate hai to bahan priyanka bhala peeche kyon rahe
 Priyanka, who came on her two-day visit to Amethi, arrived in Rae Bareli the next day to attend the wedding of her account manager Phoolchand, who works here
 is maukey par priyanka ke saath unke pati rabart wadra bhi maujuud the
 Priyanka and Robert attended the wedding even after being busy with the day's programs

 dilli main cheharaa na hone ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahi bijepi nekiran bedico party main shaamil kar bada daanv khelaa he
 The party has brought two targets with one stone by bringing Bedi
 pehla- ab arvind kejariwal bijepi ko dilli main cheharaa mil gaya
 Secondly, both Kejriwal and Kiran Bedid have come out of Anna movement, it will not be easy for the Aam Aadmi Party to target them
 (BJP netaa kiran bedi ke naam ek khulaa khat)vitt mantri arun jetali kii maujuudagi main unhen party main shaamil kiya janaa apane aap main kai sanket detaa he
 Kiran Bedi's style of interaction with the journalists was also that of the future CM
 isamen shaq nahin ki unke aane se bijepi kaaryakartaaon main utsaah to aayaa he
 So let's know what are the 5 benefits of BJP by joining Kiran Bedi in the party? 1- She has had a different image among women since being elected the first woman IPS in the country
 dilli main mahila suraksha bhi bada mudda he or supercop vaali unki chhavi aise main kaam jarur aegi
 By the way, Kiran Bedi has also been working for women for many years
 (bedi ke aane se BJP ko honge ye 5 nuksaan)2- arvind kejariwal kii hi tarah kiran bedi bhi anna andolan se nikali hai or unki image bhi bedaag he
 In such a situation, it will not be easy for Kejriwal to get votes in the name of corruption
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main kejariwal ko congress kii bhrasht chhavi kaa hi sabase zyada phayda mila tha
 3- The Aam Aadmi Party and Congress had been accusing the BJP of not having a face in Delhi for a long time
 aap ke postaron main muqabla kejariwal banaam jagadish mukhi pesh kiya ja rahaa tha
 This is the reason that BJP, after joining Kiran, indicated that after Modi, he is the face of the party in Delhi
 4- is samay desh main lav jehad or dharmantaran jaise mudde haaavee hai, jo dilli chunaav main bijepi ko bada nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Kiran Bedi is a fresh face in politics and she has not been associated with the Sangh either
 aise main kiran bedi ko sweekaaryata kii sambhaavnaaen bijepi ke kisi anya netaa kii tulana main kahin zyada bad jaati hai
 5- Kiran Bedi talked about the development agenda of PM Modi as soon as he joined the party
 abhi tak dilli main yah mudda missing tha, lekin ab bedi khud ko piem modi ke eemaandaar ripregentative kii tarah pesh kar sakengi
 In such a situation, coordination between the Center and the state can also be trusted
 piem modi ke liye bedi ke liye janata se vot maangana ab zyada ho jayega
