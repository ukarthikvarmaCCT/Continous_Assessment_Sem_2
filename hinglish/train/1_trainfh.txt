 loynel maisi barsilona kii team kii ore khelte hue kitne khatarnaak striker ho sakate hai, iskaa namoona unhone spaniole ke khilaaf mukaable main ek baar phir de diya
 He scored three goals one after the other with quickness and quickness from Bala, and at the same time Massey completed a 21st hat-trick in the Spanish Football League La Liga
 is sijan kii shuruyaat main maisi puri lay main nahin the, or lag rahaa tha ki maisi kaa man maidan main ram nahin rahaa he
 It is quite possible that the difficulty of not making Argentina champions in World Cup football may have made football unfavorable in their minds, but Massey soon recovered
 jaise-jaise laa-liga paravaan chadh rahaa he, baayen paanv se kamaal karne vaale maisi kaa jaadu bhi laut rahaa he
 He has scored three hat-tricks in the last four matches played for Barcelona
 is teesri hetric ke dauraan maisi ne barsilona ke liye apane golon kii sankhya bhi 400 ke paar pahunchaa di he, or ab unke naam barsilona ke liye lig muqablon main 402 gol darj ho chuke hai

 The only reason for this is that in club football, the best players of the world gather to join them, and everywhere the best players of the world are playing, so, due to this situation, the magic of both of them is also shone in front Comes
 udhar, argentina or portugal kii tiimon se khelte hue maisi or ronaldo kaa apana str to vahi rahata he, lekin baaki khilaadiyon ke str main kami aa jaati he, or isi vajah se na maisi argentina ko worldcup dilaa paae, na ronaldo portugal ko

 Here are the highlights of the conversation- Congress's solidarity has come at a time when BJP is contesting on the Narendra Modi factor? Will the Modi factor outweigh your preparedness in Madhya Pradesh elections? Narendra Modi is not a factor

 Just remember that in the 1998 assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, this same Narendra Modi was in charge of BJP
 us samay bijepi lagaataar duusari baar congress ke haathon buree tarah haari thi
 In such a situation, there is no point to create hype about Modi

 Come on, if you are rejecting Modi in this way, then will you defeat the development work of Shivraj Singh Chauhan in the election summer

 arabiai to swatantra sanstha he, uski report to congress ne nahin banaai
 But Shivraj claims that in case of irrigation only, he increased the area under irrigation from 4 lakh hectare to 28 lakh hectare? Will you also reject it? If irrigation has increased and grain production has increased, the consumption of seeds, fertilizer, tubebales of five horsepower capacity and power should also have been increased in the same proportion, but nothing happened

 The Panchayat of politics has started in Delhi before the general elections
 'panchayat aaj tak' main siyasat kii duniya ke tamaam diggaj jute gaye hai
 In the inaugural address of the program, India Today Group Chairman Arun Puri first welcomed the guests to the 'panchayat Aaj Tak'
 unhone kaha, 'bharat or ham, ek or rashtriya chunaav kii ore bad rahe hai
 This is the 16th general election
 is dauraan india today group ne hameshaa kuch nayaa, kuch alag sakaaratmak karne kii koshish kii he
 In this sense, these elections are special for us
 'arun puri ne kaha, 'hamane hi sabase pehle 1980 ke dashak main opinian pole kii shuruyaat kii thi or ham garv ke saath kah sakate hai ki chunavi bhavishyavaanee main ham sahi rahe hai
 As a broadcaster, 'aaj Tak' presented a 72-hour continuous show in the 1998 general election, titled 'your decision'
 1999 ke chunaav main jab ham doordarshan ke saath the, us vakt bhi hamane hindi or angreji donon main 72 ghante kaa lagaataar kaarykram prastut kiya tha
 Even after Aaj Tak's 24-hour news channel in 2001, we were at the forefront of election coverage in all elections
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main hamane ‘100 ghante 100 reporter’ laanch kiya
 This was the first program on elections when we went live for 100 hours until the government was formed
 har chunaav main kuch alag karne kii koshish hamaare liye ek parampara ban gai he
 "with this, Arun Puri welcomed everyone to the Panchayat Aaj Tak and said," i am delighted to welcome all of you to another election coverage 'panchayat Aaj Tak'
 ye chunaav kai myanon main khaas he
 This is the first time that an incumbent Prime Minister has announced his retirement before the elections
 ye pehali baar he jab kisi rajya ke mukhyamantri ko mukhya vipakshi party ne pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par pesh kiya he
 This election is also important because a member of the Gandhi family is involved in the race to become Prime Minister again
 saath hi ye chunaav isliye bhi khaas he kyonki isse pehle kshetreey netaa kabhi itane majboot nahin dikhe
 Apart from all this Arvind Kejriwal has emerged as a sensational political figure
 ’unhone kaha, ‘bhartiya chunaav main ye bhi pehali baar hua he ki ek saal puraani raajnneetik party ne chunavi diggajon ko apni ranneeti par dobaaraa sochane ko majaboor kar diya
 For some, Mr
 Kejriwal is going to spoil the game, for many he is a messiah
 yakeenan ye mudda ‘panchayat aaj tak’ kaa ek hissaa hoga
 'arun Puri hoped that the election battle would be based on issues between the parties
 unhone kaha, ‘aaj puraa din ham bade vishyon jaise bhrashtachar, mahangaai, berogari, mahila shashaktikaran or suraksha par baat karenge
 i would also like to say on this occasion that unfortunately in these elections, the media is being accused of being one-sided or acting under corporate interests
 jaisaa ki kisi bade netaa ne kaha he ki media se koi bhi rajaneta khush nahin ho saktaa, isse sahi baat nahin kahi ja sakati
 But we will not take it in the wrong sense because i know that balanced and reliable coverage of news has been the motive of India Today Group, without any fear and favoritism
 ’unhone aashaa jataai ki dinabhar kii baatcheet ke baad ‘panchayat aaj tak’ main maujuud log tamaam muddon par bahut sari jaankaree or saaf drushtikon ke saath lautenge
 He also appealed people to cast their votes in the elections
 unhone kaha, ‘ummid he ki aap yahaan se ek jaagruk voter ke rup main lautenge
 i also hope that you will definitely vote in the election, you will definitely because many countries of the world do not have the right to vote, do not let it go waste

 rafel par charchaa ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sadan main maujuud naa hone par unhone kaha, ‘’pradhanmantri to lavali uniwarsity bhaag gaye
 On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a twenty-minute open debate on the Rafale plane deal
 ab aaj pradhanmantri ke punjab daure se pehle hi unhone ise mudda bana diya
 Rahul Gandhi also tweeted about this
 So it seems our PM has fled Parliament & his own open book Rafale exam & is instead lecturing students at Lovely Univ
 in Punjab, today
 i request the students there to, respectfully, ask him to please answer the 4 questions posed to him by me, yesterday
 # rafalescam — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) January 3, 2019 It is noteworthy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to participate in the program of Lovely Professional University in Jalandhar, Punjab

 In the bjp-congress, on the one hand, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is an attacker on the Prime Minister, while the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party are also attacking him
 bhartiya janata party ke netaa jiviel narsimha raav ne rahul ko twit karte hue likhaa ki rafel ke mudde par sarkaar ne achche ankon se pariksha paas kar lee he

 dilli main bhartiya janata party kii do dinon tak chalirashtriya kaaryakariniki baithak main mishan 2019 kaa rodmap taiyaar kiya gaya
 The BJP, who has been in electoral mode, appeared to be refraining from discussing the issue of building the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 baithak ke aakhri din ravivaar ko kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne raajnneetik prastaav pesh kiya jiskaa himachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri jairam thakur or avinaash raay khanna ne samarthan kiya
 Even in this proposal, the Ram temple issue was nowhere to be seen
 haalanki bijepi aadhikarik taur par kah chuki he ki vah mandir mudde par supreme court ke faisle kaa swaagat karegi
 But Sant Samaj, along with some party leaders, has often reiterated the demand for the construction of the Ram temple
 supreme court main lambit ram mandir ke mudde par uttar pradesh ke upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ke baad ab unke ek sahyogi vidhayak ne apni raay rakhi he
 The only difference is that Keshav Maurya had talked about bringing laws for the construction of the temple, while Minister Mukut Bihari Verma has told the judiciary itself
 baharich kii kaisarganj seat se bijepi vidhayak mukut bihari verma se jab ram mandir nirmaan par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki bijepi vikaas ke mudde par satta main ai he, lekin ram mandir banegaa, kyonki yah hamaara kritasankalp he
 He further said that the matter is in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court is also ours
 itnaa hi nahin unhone aage ye bhi kaha ki nyaaypalika, prashasan, desh or mandir hamaara he
 When Prakash Javadekar, who came to the press conference after the meeting of the National Executive, was questioned on the temple issue, he was shown to be answering it and said that this was not the topic in today's discussion

 Earlier during the arguments on the sentence, the prosecution had demanded the death penalty for Rana, saying that he had killed Phoolan in a pre-planned manner
 abhiyojan paksh ne kaha tha ki rana ko jaghanya aparaadh ke liye kadi sajaa di jaani chahie kyonki uske jaisaa shaks samaaj ke liye khatra he
 However, Rana's counsel had opposed the prosecution's plea saying that the police could not prove the motive behind the murder
 rana ne adaalat se narmi baratane kii maang karte hue kaha tha ki adaalat ko use ek baar maaf kar dena chahie or police ne uske khilaaf jhuthe maamle darj karke uski chhavi kharaab kii he
 Rana told the judge, you (the judge) are sitting on the chair of God and what you say will be a matter coming out of the mouth of God

 loksabhaa chunaav ke paanchaven charan main bihar kii paanch sansadeey siton par 6 may ko vot daale jaaenge
 Among these are Sitamarhi, Madhubani and Muzaffarpur seats of Mithlanchal, Saran and Hajipur seats of Bhojpuri Land
 is charan main lalu prasad yadav or ramvilas paswan kii sansadeey seat par siyaasi jang hai, jahaan se ye donon netaa khud chunavi maidan main nahin he, lekin unke rishtedaar kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 In this phase, regional parties of Bihar will also have to go through the litmus test
 bataa den ki paanchave charan main bihar kii jin paanch siton par chunaav ho rahe hai
 In 2014, the BJP and its allies managed to win all these seats
 inamen se teen bijepi ek algepi or ek aralaisi ne jiti hai
 In the changed equation this time, the BJP and its allies have a chance to retain their seats, while the RJD and the Vikas Insan Party (VIP) have a chance to prove themselves under the grand alliance
 saaran:bihar kii hai profile siton main se ek saaran seat par pradesh kii hi nahin balki desh bhar kii nigahen hai
 While Lalu's Samadhi and Tej Pratap Yadav's father-in-law Chandrika Rai are contesting from RJD
 vahiin, bijepi se purv kendriya mantri rajeev pratap rudi ek baar phir kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 The seat was known as Chhapra before the 2008 delimitation

 This time, Chandrika Rai, who fought a political battle with Rudy face-to-face, is a candidate of the Grand Alliance

 Apart from this, Lalu Yadav has been elected MP from Saran seat four times

 Arjun Rai, considered close to Sharad Yadav from here, has been fielded by RJD
 arjuna raay 2009 main sitamarhi se jediu ke saansad rah chuke hai or 2014 main modi lahar main haar gaye the
 At the same time, JDU has got this seat under NDA, from where Sunil Kumar Pintu is a candidate
 jabaki jediu ne pehle sitamarhi seat se dow
 Varun was given the ticket, but due to opposition from local leaders, the party had to withdraw the ticket from Varun and in his place, the party inducted BJP leader Sunil Kumar Pintu into the JDU and was declared a candidate
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main upendra kushvaha kii party araspi se ram kumaar sharma jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 This time both the NDA and the Grand Alliance candidate are facing infighting in Sitamarhi, leading both to win
 mujffarpur:mujffarpur loksabhaa seat par bijepi kaa kabja he
 In this election, BJP has given ticket to its sitting MP Ajay Nishad
 jabaki mahagathbandhan ke tahat yah seat mukesh saahani kii vikasshil insaan party (viipi) ke khate main gai he, yahaan se party ne raaj bhushan choudhary nishad ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 In this way the direct fight here is between BJP vs VIP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke ajay nishad ne congress ke akhilesh prasad ko do lakh se zyada maton se maat dekar jeet hasil kii thi
 Nishad has a significant number of voters in Muzaffarpur seat
 yahi vajah he ki donon partiyon ne nishad samudaay ke ummidavaar ko chunavi maidan main utaara he, lekin viipi ke adhyaksh mukesh saahani ko is seat par apni 'san of mallaah' vaali chhavi ko sabit karne ke liye kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 However, in the changed equation, it is not easy for the BJP to win this seat
 madhubani:madhubani loksabhaa seat par bijepi ne maujuuda saansad hukumdev narayan yadav ke bete ashok yadav ko chunavi maidan main utaara he
 Under the grand alliance, this seat has gone to the VIP account, from where the party has placed a bet on Badri Kumar Poorve
 vahiin, yah seat viipi ke khate main jane se congress ke diggaj netaa shakeel ahamed ne party ko alavida kahkar nirdaleey chunaav maidan main hai
 In the changed equation of this time, the path of no one is easy
 bihar kaa yadav matadaataaon kii badi taadaad jis tarah argedy ke saath majbootee ke saath khadaa najar aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the challenge before Ashok Yadav is to maintain the father's political legacy
 vahiin, viipi party ke badri purve ke saamne shakeel ahamed ne nirdaleey utarkar unki raah ko mushkilon bhari kar di he
 Due to this, the election battle here seems to be triangular
 hajipur:hajipur loksabhaa seat algepi adhyaksh ramvilas paswan paramparaagat seat maani jaati he
 This time Ram Vilas Paswan is not contesting the election himself but his brother Pashupati Kumar Paras is in the election field from Hajipur
 paswan ke garh ko bhedane ke liye argedy ne shiv chander ram ko maidan main utaara he
 In 2014, Paswan defeated the Congress candidate by nearly two and a half lakh votes
 hajipur ke jaateey sameekaran ko dekhen to yadav, rajput, bhoomihaar, kushvaha, paswan kii sankhya kaaphi adhik he
 After this, the voters of the most backward community have an important role
 is baar ke badale hue raajnneetik sameekaran main paswan kii raajnneetik viraasat ko barkaraar rakhana aasaan nahin he
 At the same time, the candidate for RJD has a big challenge to practice Dalit, Yadav and Muslim votes

 If you believe in a healthy lifestyle, juice may or may not be an essential part of your diet
 kuch log packed fruit zeus pinaa pasand karte hai to kuch log ghar par hi falon kaa zeus nikaalte hai
 Regardless of the good quality of the packed juice, they have no match with fresh fruit juice
 lekin agar aap ghar par zeus nikaalte hai to aapako kai baton kaa khyaal bhi rakhana chahie
 Otherwise, instead of becoming healthy, it can also worsen
 zeus nikaalte samay jarur rakhen in baton kaa khyaal:1
 To be healthy, you must remove juice daily, but do you clean the juicer by the rules? If you do not clean the juicer daily then bacteria can grow in it
 aise menaap jo zeus nikaalenge wo bhi anheldi hi rahegaa
 In such a situation it is very important to clean the juicer daily
 2
 There are many fruit juices in which we add sugar
 aise main kai baar sharir main sugar kaa level bhi bad jaataa he
 Try to take juice in its natural form
 3
 If drinking juice is your habit, then try to drink fresh juice whenever you drink
 zeus ko store karke rakhana or baad main pinaa sahi nahin he
 There are many juices which are beneficial to drink immediately but drinking later is of no use
 4
 If you like to drink mixed juice then you should also know the right and healthy combination of fruits and vegetables
 iske liye dietician se jarur baat karen taaki aapako falon or subjiyon kaa talmail pataa chal jaae
 5
 agar aapkaa zeus saare fibers ko ek kinare kar detaa he to ye sahi nahin he
 Fruit fibers contain many nutrients
 aise main bahut zyada filter zeus sahi nahin rahegaa
 It is necessary to have a pulp of juice only then you will get full benefit

 a BJP MP and party spokesperson from Madhya Pradesh went to such a low level in protest against the film Padmavati that he made a very vague statement about the filmmakers of the country

 iraq ke mosul main laapata hue 39 bhartiya nagarikon ke mudde par centre sarkaar khaskar videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ghir gai hai
 After the revelation of Aaj Tak, the opposition in both houses of Parliament is seeking answers from the government on this issue
 loksabhaa main spikar sumitra mahajan ne kaha he ki sushamaa shaam paanch baje sadan main is mudde par apni baat rakhengi
 What is the case after 39 Indian laborers working there in Mamlairaq went out of the hands of this notorious terrorist organization
 2014 main in bharatiyon ke iesas ke kabje main hone kii baat saamne ai thi
 He has not had a clue since then
 mana ja rahaa tha ki ye iraq ke shahar mosul main kahin hai
 Now that Mosul is freed from ISIS occupation, Aaj Tak went there and investigated these Indians, but the information that was handed there is shocking
 darasal jis jail main in bharatiyon ke kaid hone ke baat ab tak sarkaar kahati ai he us jail kaa mosul main ab namonishaan tak nahin he
 Sushma had said, Badush is in jail, in the Parliament of India, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had claimed herself to be alive these days
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha tha ki iraq main 2014 main laapata hue 39 bhartiya naagarik baadush kii ek jail main kaid ho sakate hai
 Sushma has been saying that only after the end of the ongoing conflict in the area will the situation become clear
 sushamaa laapata bharatiyon ke parijanon se mulaakaat kar unhen lagaataar ye bharosa dilaati rahi hai ki sarkaar in sabhi bharatiyon ko har haal main waapas laaegi
 VK Singh had also said - Indian Prime Minister of Iraq is in jail as soon as the announcement of the liberation of Mosul from IS, soon after that the Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh went to Irbil to personally trace the missing Indian citizens
 Tried to find out
 singh 10 july ko vahaan gaye or unhone bhi vahaan se lautakar 'ajtak' se baatcheet main kaha tha ki laapata 39 bhartiya naagarik baadush kii jelon main ho sakate hai
 They have received this information from the NSA of Iraq
 unke mutabik 39 bhartiya jivit hai or sabhi vahaan jelon main band hai
 Jail not found in India Today investigation Contrary to the claims of Sushma and VK Singh, India Today investigation has not found any jail in Mosul where these Indians are closed
 duniya kii sabase khatarnaak jagah mosul pahunchakar india today ne baadush kii jelon ko khoja, lekin aisi koi jail nahin milin
 The dreaded terrorist organization ISIS itself has destroyed the prisons of Badush
 ab sawaal yah he ki aakhir ye bhartiya kahaan hai? kya centre sarkaar inke jivit hone kaa jhootha daawa kar rahi thi
 Earlier, Harjeet Christ, who escaped from the grip of terrorist organization ISIS in Iraq, claimed the death of these 39 Indians, but Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj refused to believe that these Indians had died
 india today ke khulaase se ghiri sarkarindia today kii ground jiro report ke baad centre sarkaar buree tarah ghir gai he
 The Congress has accused External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj of making a false statement about 39 missing Indians being alive
 congress ne kaha ki swaraj ne sansad main safed jhooth bolaa he
 Today, as soon as the proceedings started in Parliament, the opposition surrounded the government on this issue
 endie ke sahyogi akali dal ke saansad prem singh chandoomaajaraa ne bhi sarkaar se 39 bharatiyon ke mudde par sthiti spasht karne ko kaha
 Now Sushma Swaraj will make a statement in the house at five o'clock in the evening only then the picture will be clear from the government

 is baat ko sabit kar dikhaaya he kashmir ke 26-varshiya aamir hossain ne, jo apni ichhashakti ke boote duniyabar ke liye adamya saahas or jujharu pravriti kii misaal ban chukaa he
 
 
 Whatever the situation did to Aamir, it was not easy for anyone to stand on his feet, but Aamir did not give up and set an example by turning the situation in his favor
 
 
 Barcroft TV dwaara utyub par aplod kiya gaya aamir kaa yah video aap dekhen, or hamaara vaada he, aap avishvaas main apni ankhen malane ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge
 
 
 Actually, a childhood accident took both his hands off Aamir, but now in this video you will be seen playing cricket in a very 'unusual' way with absolutely normal people
 
 
 darasal, aath saal kii umr main aamir ke haath aara mashin (lakdi chirane vaala mashin) kii chapet main aa gaye the, jiske baad haathon ko kandhe se hi kaat dena padaa
 
 
 Aamir's father Bashir Ahmad, who made bat, sold everything to save his son
 
 
 teen saal tak aspataal main rahane ke baad jab aamir baahar aayaa, to niraash yaa hataash nahin tha, balki man main nae sire se jivan kii shuruyaat karne kaa jazbaa tha
 
 
 Today, Aamir is considered a cricketer who specializes in shooting shots, and not only that, he is also the captain of Kashmir's Para Cricket team
 
 
 shaayad pita ke peshey kii vajah se tha, lekin aamir ko cricket se bachapan se hi lagaav tha
 
 
 Even after the departure of hands, attachment to cricket did not diminish, and he devised a new way of catching the bat
 
 
 aamir balle ko apane kandhe or gale ke bich main fansaakar khelte hai, or shandaar shot lagane main maahir kahe jate hai
 
 
 Aamir also bowls
 
 
 hairaani ho rahi he
 
 
 The But the truth is that he also performs spin bowling by trapping the ball between the toes
 
 
 or haa, fielding ke vakt bhi aamir maidan main hi rahete hai, kyonki pairon se ball ko rokkar fielding karne main bhi unhen maharath hasil he
 
 
 Apart from playing cricket, Aamir also writes with the help of his feet, and can even do painting
 
 
 12veen tak schuli padhai kar chuke aamir kisi par bhi nirbhar nahin hai, or apana sara kaam - jaise dadhi bananaa, nahaana, kapade pahananaa - khud hi karte hai
 
 
 Well, a lot of talk has happened, now you watch this video of Aamir full of 'fantastic confidence'
 
 
 uttar pradesh main chunaav kii sargarmi ke bich kairana ko lekar ai rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog kii report ne is puure mudde ko nae sire se garm kar diya he
 The report of the Human Rights Commission stated that there was a migration of Hindu families from Kairana because the law and order was not well there
 report main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki kairana main kuch muslim yuvak hinduon kii bahu-betiyon ke saath chhedchhad karte the or vahaan gundgardee kaa aatank tha
 The report has given a new life to the BJP due to the report on the life of the BJP because the report is almost confirming the same things as the BJP was making
 ye baat tay he ki bhartiya janata party ab is maamle par jamkar siyasat karegi or chunaav main is mudde ko khub bhunaayegi
 Shivpal said - Doshi will not be spared, the report of the Human Rights Commission on Kairana is a new problem for the Samajwadi Party government, having already suffered an attack on the law system
 is maamle main puche jane parashivpal yadavane itawa main kaha kipulice kii laaparvaaheesamne ai he or is maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 He said that action will be taken against anyone who is guilty
 lekin lagata nahin he ki bijepi is maamle ko itani aasaani se dabane degi
 After the report of BJP MP NHRC met IG, Kairana MP Hukum Singh, Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal, Baghpat MP Satyapal Singh, Saharanpur MP Raghav Lakhanpal, Nagina MP Yashwant Singh and Meerut MLA Ajay Anand from IG Meerut Met and raised the question of law and order
 ajit singh ne report ko khaarij kiya, congress ne kaati kannicongress ne is maamle main kanni kaatane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 When asked about this, Ghulam Nabi Azad, the in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, wanted to save his life by saying that he had not seen this report yet
 rashtriya lokdal ke adhyaksh ajit singh ji guuruuvaar ko lakhanu main the
 He rejected the report of the Human Rights Commission and said that the report of the Commission has no meaning
 ajit singh ne kaha ki kairana se kareeb saadhe teen sau pariwaron ke palaayan kii baat kahi ja rahi thi lekin enechaarsi ne sirf 6 pariwaron se baat karke report taiyaar kar di he
 The dominance of Hukum Singh is going to increase that the position of BJP leader Hukum Singh will be strengthened after the NHRC report as he was the first to raise the issue of mass migration by taking up the case of Kairana
 mujffarnagar ke dangon ke baad pashchimi uttar pradesh main sampradayik vibhaajan pehle se hi ho rakhaa he
 After the issue of Kairana becomes hot, there will be more politics on it

 sabha main piem ne kaha ki ham vibhaajankaree nahin hai, jo log khud ko ekta kaa thekedaar kehete hai unhone sirf andhra kaa vibhaajan kiya or aaj bhi vahaan par shanti nahin he
 We are the ones who made Uttarakhand out of UP, Chhattisgarh out of MP and Jharkhand out of Bihar but did not get a spark
 piem bole ki bijepi ko chuaachhut kaa shikaar hona padaa he, main har kisi se kahata hum ki nae sire se shuruyaat kii jarurat he
 We will also lack, but our intentions are noble
 unhone kaha ki agar ham votbank kii raajnneeti karte to kuch naa karte lekin hamane faisla kiya or saamaanya varg ko bhi aarakshan diya, hamane ghar diya to kisi kii jati nahin poochi
 The Prime Minister said that i was here on April 25, when Kashi showed the worldliness which affected the whole of India
 unhone kaha ki 19 may ko jab yahaan par matdaan hona tha, tab meraa kaashi aane kaa man tha
 But the order of the people was that i should not come here, only after victory i should come here
 piem bole ki varanasi main namakan to ek modi ne kiya, lekin chunaav har ghar ke modi ne ladaa
 Everybody became Narendra Modi in Kashi and the results are in front of the world today
 unhone kaha ki kaashi ke kaaryakarta aaraam se nahin baithe, ki modi ji hai jeet hi jaaenge
 On the success of the hat-trick of victory in UP, he said that even today i am speaking to Kashi, but the whole UP is a request for greetings
 upi desh kii raajnneeti ko disha de rahaa he, swasth loktantr kii neenv ko majboot kar rahaa he

 Tell Bahubali: The Beginning is the biggest film of Indian cinema so far
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana ke jariye ek baar phir sangh par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 The Shiv Sena has taken a dig at the mistake of the map of India printed in the RSS mouthpiece
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana memrashtriya swayamsevak sanghake mukhpatr orgeniser ko moorkhpatr kaha he
 Saamna in its Friday issue has heard a lot of havoc to the Sangh
 shivasena ne likhaa he kiaresaiske mukhpatr orgeniser ne kashmir ko pakistan ke jabade main daal diya he
 The mouthpiece of the Union, which always teaches nationality lessons, has proved to be a fool
 gauratlab he ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke mukhpatr kaa taaja ank bazaar main aa gaya he
 In this issue a map of SAARC countries has been printed in which a major part of Kashmir has been handed over to Pakistan
 aresas ne apane online ank main is galati ko sudhaar liya he lekin mukhpatr kaa print bazaar main aa chukaa he
 On the same mistake of the Sangh, it is getting gritty everywhere
 shivasena ne saamana main likhaa he ki mufti mohammad said ko lekar vaise hi kaaphi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In such an environment from above, the foolish paper of the Sangh has made Kashmir in Pakistan's jaws and made the atmosphere more bitter
 jaahir is harakat ke baad pakistan main baithe shaitanon ke man main to laddu foot rahen honge
 AAP leader Kumar Vishwas has also criticized the Sangh by tweeting the Sangh's mistake
 rajdhani dilli sahit desh ke kai rajyon main aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay ke naam par ayyashi kaa adda chalaane vaala dhongi baba virendra dev dikshit bhandaphod hone ke baad se hi gaayab he
 The court has ordered Dhongi Baba's lawyer and CBI to present Virendra Dev, but Baba says that no one is getting it
 desh ke kai shaharon main aadhyatm kii shiksha dene ke naam par mahilaon or ladakiyon ke saath balaatkaar or shaareerik shoshan karne ke aaropon se ghira yah dhongi baba desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency sibiai ke liye ek khoj banakar rah gaya he
 After the court's order, the CBI started looking for Virendra Dev, but you will also be shocked to know what the CBI has done so far
 sibiai ne baba kii talash main usase jude hazaron logon ke sidiaar or bayaan darj kiye
 But till now she has only reached the conclusion that Vivendra Dev was last seen on 22 April 2015
 baba kii last lokation farrukhabad thi, jab vah apni bahan se mila tha
 The Delhi High Court has so far given several orders to present Virendra Dev, yet the CBI has so far failed to find Baba and present him before the court
 isaki sabase badi vajah yah he ki baba ko pichley kuch saalon main kisi ne dekha hi nahin he
 To find Baba, many CBI teams went to every possible place in the country where some clues related to Baba could be found
 lekin maano baba ne aisi jagah samadhi le lee he ki use khoj nikalnaa mushkil hi nahin naammumkin ho gaya he
 But this disappearance raises many questions
 pehla sawaal to yah ki jab baba 2015 se hi gaayab he to uske teen saal baad us par maamla kyon darj hua?doosraa ahm sawaal he ki baba jab laapata tha to ashram ke kisi vyakti or uske shraddhaluon ne use khojane kii zahamat kyon nahin uthaai? or teesraa sawaal to yahi uthta he ki baba kii gairmaujuudagi main itane saare ashramon kaa sanchaalan koun kar rahaa tha?sibiai ne in sawaalon ke ird-gird bhi ashram or baba se jude logon se poochtacha kii, lekin uske iske baavjood kuch nahin laga
 The CBI has registered three cases of sexual exploitation and kidnapping against Baba
 aarope he ki vishvavidhyalay ke naam par chalaae ja rahe ayyashi ke ashramon main ladakiyon ko jabaran bandhak banaakar rakhaa jaataa tha or baba unka yon shoshan karata tha
 After several days of uproar by the families of the victims, the investigation has been submitted to the CBI by the Delhi High Court

 police adhikari ne bataaya ki pandeya uttarakhand ke almora kshetra ke nivasee the

 maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Violence always has a deep connection with religion or faith
 islam, isai yaa phir marxvaadi sabhi kitaabi maton par yah lagu hota he
 The Muslim massacres and revolutionary communists should fill the water in front of the massacres in Europe in the early part of the Christian era

 Delhi Police has denied permission to Anna Hazare to fast on Jayaprakash Narayan Park from 16 August
 hazaare paksh dwaara anshan teen din ke bheetar khatm kar dene or pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya paanch hajaar tak simit rakhane kii shart maanane se inkaar kar dene ke baad yah ghatnakram hua he
 Video: Congress's attack on Anna, Anna's counterattack, now there is a situation of confrontation between Hazare and Delhi Police
 hazaare ke saathi kaaryakartaaon ne kaha he ki gandhivadi 16 agast ko rajghat par rashtrapita ko shradhanjali dene ke baad firozshah kotla ke nikat sthit jaiprakash narayan park pahunchenge or giraftaar denge
 Video: Delhi Police imposed an agitation on Anna's hunger The police had laid 22 conditions to allow fast on Jayprakash Narayan Park and sought affidavits in this regard from Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal, Prashant Bhushan, Shanti Bhushan and Kiran Bedi
 yah ghatnakram aise din hua he jab pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par laal kile kii pracheer par tirangaa fahraane ke baad raashtra ke naam sambodhan main lokapal vidheyak par hazaare ke prastaavit anshan par jahiraa taur par sawaal uthaaye or kaha ki jo vidheyak ke virdohi hai, unhen aamaran anshan nahin karnaa chaiye
 See why from Anna's letter, sources in the Tilamilai Congress Delhi Police said that the fast is not being allowed on Jayaprakash Narayan Park as the Hazare side has not given a 'full and proper' affidavit on all 22 terms
 hazaare ke kareebi manish sitaudiya ne bataaya ki unhone 22 main se 16 sharton ko maanate hue halafanama police ko diya tha
 The remaining six conditions are not considered because they are unconstitutional
 dilli police ko saunpe halafname main hajaare paksh ne chah sharton ko chhodkar shesh 16 sharton maan lee
 The terms that the Hazare side has not accepted are -1
 - anshan ko 18 agast kii shaam chah baje tak khatm kar dena2
 - Not to allow more than 5,000 crowds to fast
 - 50 kaaron or 50 dupahiyaa vaahanon ko hi parking kii anumati4
 5 All government activists, including Hazare, monitored by government doctors
 5
 - raat nau baje ke baad laudspikar nahin bajaanaa or bade shaamiyane nahin lagaana
 The Hazare party claims that these conditions are unconstitutional
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha ki unhone kaaphi samanvay kiya or hazaare paksh kii madad kii
 But if the Hazare side forcibly tries to enter the park, they will be forced to take action
 india against karpshan ke pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘hazaare 16 agast ko rajghat jaayenge or phir jaiprakash narayan park jaayenge
 If the police gave us permission, then there will be a fast, otherwise arrest will be given
 ’ udhar, arvind kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya ki unhen bhrasht logon se anumati lene ko majaboor hona padaa he
 Delhi Police has imposed conditions at the behest of the leaders

 We will not accept such unconstitutional terms
 ’ unhone pradhanmantri kii tippaniyon ko bhi ‘asamvedansheel’ qaraar diya
 Kiran Bedi claimed that people are no longer confident of the UPA government as they have lost the historic opportunity to form a strong Lokpal
 unhone kaha, ‘vah (pradhanmantri) aakhri nirnaayak ke rup main bol rahe hai
 He says that you cannot protest
 yah logon kii ichha ke khilaaf un par vidheyak thopanaa he
 The Prime Minister is imposing this bill on the country and saying that the protest is wrong
 pradhanmantri logon se apane anusaar chalane ko kah rahe hai
 'he alleged,' The Prime Minister is insensitive to public sentiment
 surveykshanon or janamat sangrahon main kaha gaya he ki janata ne sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak ko khaarij kar diya he
 He is not looking at it

 People in Uttarakhand may be suffering from rain and disaster, but there are some people in the mountains who have not been able to break their spirits
 desh kii aazaadee kii 72veen saalagirah chamoli jile ke us gaanv main bhi manaai gai jisane desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai se lekar kargil kii ladaai main apana yogadan diya
 The small village nestled in the lap of the mountains in Chamoli district reached till today where the tricolor was hoisted irrespective of heavy rains and inclement weather
 schuli bacchon ne scout kii dress main band ke saath deshbhakti ko naare lagaae or tirangaa lekar desh ke geet gunagunaae
 Sawad village with 425 families situated amidst mountains in Chamoli district is very special
 is gaanv ke har parivaar ne desh kii alag-alag yudhon ke liye naunihaal nyochaavar kiye hai
 Every household in this village has given soldiers who took part in separate wars
 shaheedon or sainikon kii yaad main gaanv main bane smarak par tirangaa fahraaya gaya
 Even heavy rains could not stop these servicemen from hoisting the tricolor
 sawad gaanv ke beton ne swadhinata kii ladaai ladi, netaji subhash chandra bose kii aaazaad hind fouj kaa bhi hissaa rahe, vahiin pehle or duusare vishwayuddh main bhi qurbaani di
 The sons of this village also killed enemies in the 1965 and 1971 wars
 aazaadee kii ladaai se lekar kargil yuddh main shahadat dene vaale is gaanv ke faujee ab ek nai ladaai lard rahe hai jo kisi dushman ke khilaaf nahin balki sarkaar ke saath hai
 This battle is two decades old and is being fought through papers
 ye ladaai sadak, skool or ek aspataal ke liye ke liye he
 Virendra Singh, the village deputy chief, says that he pleaded a lot for the road but no one heard his plea
 is gaanv ek faujee aise bhi hai jinhone 71 kii ladaai main pakistaniyon ke haath kaat die the lekin ab apane haath jab buudhe ho gaye to sarkaar inaki sunati nahin he
 Fauji of Sarad village is demanding a 10-km long road for his village, a central school and a small hospital for primary treatment
 uppradhan ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki 10 kilometre lambii sadak 25 saal pehle banaai gai thi lekin isaki marammat nahin hoti
 The road is completely broken and it is risky to move
 phogiyon kaa kahana he ki unke intjaar ko dhai dashak biit gaye lekin ek baar jo sadak bani uski marammat dobaaraa kabhi nahin hui
 To reach this village nestled on a hill, the long journey of 10 kilometers is like hell torture
 barsaat main tuuti-phooti sadaken khiskkar khai main tabdeel ho gai hai
 The soldiers say that the lack of roads has endangered the lives of small children in the village
 in phogiyon ne uttarakhand ke kai mukhyamantriyon ke aage guhaar lagaai, sarkari daftaron main yachika di lekin sunwaayee nahin hui
 There is a government school, but for better education, they want a central school in the village whose demand has been sent to the government of the state many times
 is gaanv ke phogiyon kii samasya par hamane ilaake ke tehseeldaar emel bhetwal se poocha to tehseeldaar sahab ne safai di ki unhen samasya kaa gyaan he lekin ilaake main duusari jagahon par badal fatne kii ghatana se hui tabaahi se nipatane kii chunauti philhal zyada badi he jiske baad vah is gaanv kii maang par jarur dhyaan denge
 Tehsildar Sahabka says that the Chief Minister of the state has also been informed about the demand of hospital and Kendriya Vidyalaya in the village but the action has not been done yet
 aazaadee ke 71 saal baad bhi is gaanv ko moolbhoot suvidhaayen naseeb nahin he
 On the 72nd anniversary of independence, the soldiers are requesting the government of the country that their village should get the gift of a road school and a hospital
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav se pehle chunaav ayog eczit pole or janamat surveykshan ke prasaaran par nayaa dishanirdesh jari kar saktaa he
 Till the issue of government regulations on the issue, the Supreme Court had placed the responsibility of setting guidelines regarding the exit poll and public opinion poll, after which such efforts are being made
 chunaav ayog ke sutron ne bataaya jab nyaayalay ne aadesh jari kar diya he tab ayog is par vichaar karegaa
 It will be almost the same as the Commission has done before
 gauratlab he ki ayog ne kuch varsh pehle chunaav ke antim charan kii samaapti tak eczit pole ke prasaaran or prakaashan par roak laga di thi
 After this the media organizations had approached the Supreme Court and the order was withdrawn
 chunaav ayog ne adaalat se is baat par nirnay karne ko kaha tha ki chunaav prakriya ke dauraan ek vishesh avadhi ke liye eczit pole or janamat surveykshan ke prakaashan or prasaaran par vyavhaarik roak lagaayi jaani chahie yaa nahin

 US President Donald Trump left for a foreign tour on Friday after being badly engulfed in his country
 america raashtrapati banane ke baad donald trump kii yah pehali videsh yatra he
 US media say Trump has left his life abroad after being embroiled in controversies over the removal of James Komi, the FBI chief who was investigating Russia's interference in the US presidential election, and giving crucial intelligence to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
 america raashtrapati apane pehle videshi daure par saudi arab, israel, italy or belgium jaaenge
 Now questions are arising that will Trump, who has been in controversies since assuming power in America, be able to make his first foreign trip a success? Interestingly, Donald Trump is starting his first foreign tour from a Muslim country
 vah sabase pehle saudi arab ke riyaad pahunchenge, jahaan duniya ke 50 muslim deshon ke netaaon ko sambodhit karenge
 The White House says that Donald Trump in Riyadh will preach on Islam to Islamic countries
 ise bhi padhieh trump kii is ghoshnaa se duniya ke 50 islamic desh dantamerica raashtrapati chunaav or pad sambhaavne se lekar ab musalamaanon ke khilaaf lagaataar jehar ugalane vaale trump ke saamne apni videsh yatra ko safal sabit karne kii kadi chunauti he
 Trump has always dealt with controversies
 sienen kaa kahana he ki trump ne vivaad ke sawaalon se bachane ke liye videsh daure par jane kaa vikalp chunaa he
 The US president usually elects neighboring countries such as Canada or Mexico for his first foreign tour, but Trump has taken the decision
 ski news kaa kahana he ki trump sochate hai ki agar vah videsh yatra par chale jaaenge, to waapas aane tak vivaad khatm ho jaaenge
 But this is not going to happen, they will have to answer the questions
 haal hi main trump jhunjhalaakar kaha tha ki unke saath jaisaa bartaav kiya ja rahaa he, vaisaa aaj tak kisi duusare raashtrapati ke saath nahin kiya gaya
 Trump not only removed FBI chief Komi, but also appointed a special counsel to investigate the Russia-related case
 iske alaava trump ke videshi daure ko lekar yah bhi sawaal ahm he ki trump ko rajanyik anubhav nahin he
 He does not know any kind of diplomacy, so how will he make his tour a success? Total people are saying about their Middle East tour that Trump first chose these countries to make the tour easier
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 Now that the Ashok Lavasa committee has submitted its report to the government and soon Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will take a final decision on this report from the government
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak saat maheene se zyada samay biit chukaa he or abhi tak kisi bhi samiti ne apni report nahin saunpi he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 ab jab ashok lavasa samiti ne apni report sarkaar ko saunp di he or jald hi vittamantri arun jetali is report par koi antim faisla sarkaar kii ore se le lenge
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months but till now more than seven months have passed and so far no committee has submitted its report
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he

 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak saat maheene se zyada samay biit chukaa he or abhi tak kisi bhi samiti ne apni report nahin saunpi he
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months but till now more than seven months have passed and so far no committee has submitted its report

 bollywood actor rajkumaar raav kii film 'shaadi main jarur aana' ko shanivaar shaam raashtrapati bhawan main dikhaaya gaya
 In this film, Rajkumar Rao and Kriti Kharbanda were seen in the lead role
 film ke nirmaataa vinod bachchan ne bataaya ki unke paas raashtrapati ke karyaalay se phone aayaa tha or hamen bataaya gaya ki mantralay is film ko dekhnaa chahta he, kyonki unhone iske bare main acchhee baaten suni hai
 Rajkumar Rao's leg fractured during the reality show, and said about the film, "I was very happy to hear this and so, we aired the film in Rashtrapati Bhavan
 ravivaar ko yah film anya mantralayon main prasaarit kii jaaegi
 It is a small town family film
 " unhone kaha, "is film main ek ipies adhikari ke jivan ke safar tathaa sangharsh ko darshaya gaya he
 With this, all ministers can see themselves folded
 "saawali surat kii vajah se jab rajkumaar raav ko hona padaa rijectbox offis par chote kasbon ke paridrishy par baniin filmon- 'shaadi main jarur aana', 'bareli kii barfi' or 'shubh mangal saavdhaan' ko kaaphi lokapriyata hasil ho rahi he
 Vinod believes that people are able to relate themselves to the characters of these films and that is why people are liking it
 vinod ne kaha ki sach kaha jaae, to mobile phone ke jamaane main sabase acha vyapaar ye filmein chote kasbon par aadhaarit kahaniyon ke kaaran kar paa rahi hai, kyonki darshak inhen mobile phonon main dekhne ke bajaae cinemagharon main jaakar dekh rahe hai
 'shaadi Mein Sure Aana' was released in theaters on November 10 this year and is still airing in single-screen theaters in smaller towns
 aapke mobile phone par kya paryaapt network he? kya aapako puri data speed milti he? kya aapako mobile companiyon ne kol drop harjaana dena shuru kiya he? agar aapke jawaab “na” main hai, jaahir he jo honge hi, to iske liye sarkaar se zyada ham khud jimmedaar hai
 Actually, we Indians are victims of a strange kind of oblivion
 ham aksar un surkhiyon ko bhul jate hai jo hamen apane jehan main chhap kar rakhni chahie kyonki aisa karnaa naagarik or upabhokta hone ke naate hamaare hiton ke liye anivaary he
 When we forget them, it becomes even more convenient for the government to forget them
 iske badale vah siyasat main hamen bharat mata kii jai jaisi besabab bahasein pakadaa detii he jo hamen kahin nahin le jaatin
 One such headline was made in August last year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a review meeting of the telecom sector, expressed deep displeasure over the call drop and instructed to fix it "urgently"
 piemo se jari bayaan main kaha gaya tha ki wais network par kol drop kii samasya data network tak nahin jaani chahie
 We forgot this headline and got embroiled in false debates on Twitter, Facebook and TV studios
 hamane palatakar is aadesh kii kiafiyat nahin poochi
 The problem of call drop has spread to weak data network where 2G speed is also difficult in the name of 3G
 march main aae ek network surveykshan ke mutabik, bharat main kol drop badhkar 4
 73 per cent which is higher than the TRAI standard of 2 per cent and the global standard of 3 per cent
 is bich mobile companiyon ne kharaab sarvice par upabhoktaaon ko paise waapas karne ke niyam ko maanane se inkaar karte hue maamle ko supreme court tak pahunchaa diya, jahaan kamjor pairvi or ajeebogareeb adeshon ke liye mashhoor tiri, puure maamle par kanoonee va takneekee antarvirodhon ke chalate adaalat kii fatkaar sun rahi he
 It is unlikely that this penalty will be implemented
 beete saal isi stambh main hamane likhaa tha ki mek in india, digital india jaise vishaal global abhiyaanon ko shuru karne vaali sarkaar ke liye kharaab mobile network itani badi samasya nahin he jise sanbhaalane ke liye sansad main sahmati banani pade
 Initiatives from all three areas, administrative, technical and legal, were necessary to fix the malfunctioning network which was yet to be seen and in the meantime the operators framed the case in court
 kol drop ke samaadhaan ke sankalp main sabase badi kami operataron par sakhti ko lekar najar aati he
 Terming the spectrum auction as its biggest success in 2014, the government had claimed that the telecom sector will now launch fraud, as companies have got sufficient spectrum
 companiyaan spectrum aapas main baant sakati hai or apane tower par duusari company ko jagah de sakati hai
 Despite the substantial spectrum, if the call drops are increasing, it is because companies have not invested in the network
 janvari 2013-march 2015 ke bich wais network kaa istemaal 12 fisadi badha lekin network (beaties) kshamta main keval 8 fisadi kaa hi ijapha hua
 According to TRAI, data network usage over 3G increased by 252 per cent in the last two years but companies increased the network by only 61 per cent
 sarkaar chaahati to network or upabhoktaaon kii sankhya ke bich sakchat santulan banane ke niyam tay kar sakati he
 So that companies are not only engaged in the competition of gathering customers, but are also obliged to invest sufficiently in the network
 tiri khud maan rahi he ki toweron main kami kol drop kii badi vajah he
 According to mobile companies, one lakh towers are currently needed to improve the network and prevent call drop
 isamen zyaadaatar tower mahanagaron main chahie
 Had the government been serious, the task of raising a few yards of land or roofs for small towers with the cooperation of the states could have been done by just an administrative order
 iske saath hi kol drop samaadhaan ke nae takneekee prayaason kii bhi jarurat he
 There are technologies available in the market that can create systems such as mobile exchanges within buildings that are an alternative to the weakness of spectrum in closed campuses
 duniya ke anya shaharon main telecom network landline or mobile ke bich santulan sthapit karte hai taaki spectrum kii khapat simit ho sake
 The government should initiate new technologies for landline return and interoperability communication which is essential to reduce pressure on mobile networks
 operataron ko dandatmak praavdhaanon main kasne ke liye majboot kanoonee peshbandi jaruri thi
 The long history of the court battle between regulators and operators in the telecommunications sector suggests that the regulator often loses due to weak preparations
 supreme court ne kol drop par penalty ke aadesh ko lekar tiri ko hi kathghare main khadaa kiya he
 While TRAI made a rule to pay penalty for call drop, on the other hand, in a research paper in November last, it also said that technical reasons such as lack of spectrum and shortage of towers are also responsible for bad network
 oparator ab is tark ke sahare seva thik karne or kharaab seva par dand bharne se bachane kii jugat main hai
 Network congestion is going to be the biggest problem in India's path of going digital, but despite the intervention of the Prime Minister, the government has almost lost the battle to end the call drop
 sanchaar mantralay puri tarah mobile operataron ke rahamokaram par he, jo adalati ladaaiyon main hameshaa jitate rahe hai
 The government lost because the requisite courage and seriousness in handling this problem was not seen
 aaj hamaare paas na acchhee sarvice he or na hi uske kharaab hone par nuksaan kii bharpai kii vyavastha
 We have been cheated by both the market and the government
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 Anand Kumar has loved the trailer of the film and has appreciated the acting of Hrithik Roshan
 saath hi ek haalia intervyuu main unhone film ke nirdeshak vikaas bahal kii bhi prashansa kii he jinhen kuch samay pehle hi antrim cameti dwaara mitu ke tahat lage aaropon par clin chit mili he
 In an interview given to Pinkvilla, Anand said, "my father always used to say that hard work never goes in vain
" isliye main jivan bhar kaaphi ashaavadi rahaa
 i saw how Vikas gave his 100% in the film
 ek riter ke taur par ho yaa phir ek diarector ke taur par, vikaas bahal gaanv main bacchon ke paas jaakar unke saath samay bitaate the
 He spent a lot of time at the ground level

 When we were in the village
 us dauraan vikaas ek divyang se mili the or uske saath unhone kaaphi samay bitaayaa tha
 When we came back a month later, Vikas brought a support pad for that child from London
 unki is baat ne mujhe kaaphi prabhavit kiya
 Talking about the film, its release date has been kept on July 12, 2019
 aaj ke bachche har kaam main tej hai phir chaahe wo padhai ho, tallent ho yaa phir hai tech takanic
 Children are leaving the elders behind in every respect
 phone se lekar ypad tak inhen har gajet kii acchhee nolej hoti he, agar aapkaa baccha bhi aisa he to saavdhaan ho jaaie
 According to a recent research, ipads can be a threat to children's muscles
 haddia par padataa he prabhaavashodhakartaaon ke anusaar ypad par adhik samay bitaane vaale yuvabachchon kii mansapeshianor unki haddiyaan sahi tarah se viksit nahin hoti hai
 The study was based on a comparison of three-year and four-year-olds who play with toys and who play with an electronic device

 magar khilaunon se khilne ke dauraan unhone puure sharir kaa adhik upyog kiya
 The results show that children use their upper limb six times more when playing with toys and three times more than their upper limbs when using an ipad
 aam aadmi party ne rajyasabha ke liye apane teenon ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan kar diya he
 These include the names of Sanjay Singh, Sushil Gupta and ND Gupta
 kejariwal ne party or sanghathan se sirf sanjay singh kaa naam shaamil kiya he, baaki jin donon netaaon ke naam par muhar lagi he unka taalluk party se nahin he
 The way Kejriwal has decided to send ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta to the Rajya Sabha by bypassing the name of Kumar Vishwas, the question arises whether it is Kejriwal's idealistic politics or casteist? It turned out to be a party
 kejarivalke saath kai netaaon ne is party ko khadaa kiya, lekin rajyasabha ke liye aise netaaon main se eklaute sanjay singh ke naam par muhar lagi he
 The founding member of the party, Kumar Vishwas was hoping to go to Rajya Sabha
 lekin kejariwal ne unke armaanon par pani pher diya he
 Kumar Vishwas said with full heart that congratulations to the names Kejriwal chose for the Rajya Sabha
 kejariwal ne anna andolan se alag hokar desh menadarshavaadi raajnneetikarne kii baaten kahi thim, lekin vakt be vakt wo apane samaaj or jati kaa zikr karnaa nahin bhoolatey
 During the assembly elections, Arvind Kejriwal while addressing a rally of businessmen at Nehru Place in Delhi had said, 'I am a tradesman and i understand business
 unhone kaha mulya vardhit kar vibhaag dwaara chalaaye ja rahe jabaran vasuuli or chhapemari giroh ko samaapt kiya jayega
 He also announced several steps to woo businessmen
 ' kejariwal ne kaha tha ki agarwal samudaay is desh kii iconmi kii ridh kii haddi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party's PAC also has three members of the Vaishya community
 inamen kejariwal, ashutosh or pankaj gupta vaisya samudaay se hai
 When it came to sending Rajya Sabha, Kejriwal's eyes rested on the Vaishya community itself
 party ke diggaj netaaon ko darkinar karke unhone susheel gupta or endi gupta ke alaava sanjay singh ko chunaa he
 In such a situation, they are being targeted on social media by accusing them of doing racist politics
 aam aadmi party kii sarvocch nirnaayak ikai main bhi aam aadmi kii raajnneeti karne kaa daawa karne waalon ne sabhi 11 sadsy savarna hai
 On the other hand, out of the 25 National Convenors of the party, all but one name are Savarnas
 party ke dilli main kejariwal sahit 7 mantri hai jinamein se 5 savarna hai
 Obviously, it will not be easy for Arvind Kejriwal to answer the questions arising out of him on casteist politics

 The rear panel is of leather finish which is quite easy to hold and keeps the grip good

 The body of zenfone AR is such that it does not detect scratch, which is a good thing
 kul mila kar dizin or bild quality ke maamle main yah smartphone is segment ke duusare divaais se alag dikhataa he or iske liye isamen diya gaya ledar dizin or jatil camera modul he jo metal surphace par di gai he
 Display zenfone AR 5
 7 inch kii WQHD disple di gai he panel super amolade he or khaas baat ye he ki isaki disple zyada saturated nahin he
 Its display is not better than Galaxy S8, but colors look good
 suraj kii raushnee main isaki screen ke contant aap aasaani se pard sakate hai
 Since this smartphone is virtual reality based and designed for artificial intelligence, you will get the real fun of its screen in VR headset
 is rivyuu main ham aage bataaenge ki yah smartphone google ke virtual reality hedset ke saath yah kaisaa kaam karata he
 The performance is the Asus zenfone AR high end smartphone and has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor
 haalanki yah ek saal purana procesar he, lekin yah stable he
 a variant has 128GB of internal memory with 8GB of RAM
 yah smartphone lag nahin karata or hang nahin karata
 Moving from one app to another is easy
 kai hai and gaming kar sakate hai koi lag nahin hoga
 Its specialty is that you can do gaming by installing virtual reality games and installing a headset, you will get a different experience
 haalanki viaar hedset main aadhe ghante tak aap chalaa rahe hai to yah smartphone garm hota he
 Overall this is a smartphone with good performance and the user interface given in it is the company's custom, so you might not like it
 nijee taur par yah yujar interphes thodaa pareshaan karne vaala he
 Camera Asus zenfone AR has a 23-megapixel rear camera, which has an aperture f / 2
 0 he
 In addition, it has 4-axis optical image stabilization and electronic image stabilization
 hamane is smartphone ko yuj kiya he ek baat saaf hi isamen diya gaya camera modul powerful he acchhee tasviren clic karata he
 The color reproduction is good and after clicking the photo due to the given tango array, you can manage the background and foreground focus of the photo
 acchhee lite ho yaa aap baahar photography kar rahe hai to aap apni profeshlan skill ke saath isse delaar kii tarah hi image clic kar sakate hai
 Good detailing will be seen in the photos, but its camera has disappointed us a bit in low light
 zenfone AR kaa virtual reality rivyuu vikaas kumaar ke dwaramein yah maanakar chal rahaa hoon ki aap 360 degree photo / video dekh chuke honge
 If you have not seen, then see
 utyub par 360 degree photo / video likhakar search kiijie, mil jayega
 Over the past few years, this feature has made its worldwide reach very fast
 asal main is fichar kii vajah se video / photo dekhne vaala us sthaan par maujuud hone jaisaa fil karne karne lagata he
 He is not just an audience
 wo video yaa photo ko keval dekh nahin rahaa hota he, wo us video photo ko mahasoos kar rahaa hota he
 You may have realized this feeling when you have seen 60 degree photos / videos on your laptop / computer with the help of a mouse or with your finger on the mobile, but now the thing has come
 or ye wo chiz he jo 60 degree photo / video dekhne kaa tareeqa or uskaa ahsaas hi badal degi yaa kahen ki badal rahi he
 The way in which 60 degree photo / video became popular among the people on social media, this new device is also becoming popular among the people
 to chaliye, aapako is khilone (divaais) se milwate hai or aapako apana anubhav bataane kii koshish karte he
 This device is called VR Headset
 viaar kaa matlab he virtual reality, or virtual reality matlab ki ek aisi sachai jo vaastavik nahin he lekin he
 You can feel this truth
 to jab aap is hedset ko pahanakar or isaki madad se koi 60 degree photo / video dekhte hai to aap fil karte hai ki aap is parivesh main pahunch chuke hai jahaan kaa video he
 You find yourself in the midst of that situation
 pichley ek hafte maine aise hi ek viaar hedset ko istemaal kiya or uski madad se kai saare 60 degree photo / video dekhe
 With this Google headset, you also get a remote-like thing, with the help of which you take videos back and forth while wearing the headset
 nayaa video play kar lete hai
 Prior to this headset, there was no such controller with VR headset which caused some trouble because if you have seen one video, then for the other you had to remove the mobile from the headset and put another video, which is very annoying
 lekin google ke is hedset or viaar ap kii madad se 60 degree photo / video dekhnaa ek alag anubhav hi detaa he
 Once i installed the headset, i watched 60 degree videos one after the other for the next two hours
 google ke hedset ke saath maine asus kaa phone istemaal kiya jisamen viaar ap priloded tha
 You will get to experience all these with zenfone AR
 yah ap sabhi smartphone main nahin chalata
 If i talk about the experience, it was fantastic
 maine himalay ke paas ke ek gaanv kii kahani dekhi or dekhte hue aisa laga ki main muniraka ke apane kamare main naa hokar unke bich hoon
 If you have ever seen a biscope in your childhood, then consider it exactly the same
 bas usamen keval fato chalati thim or isamen photo ke saath-saath video bhi chalata he
 You can also listen
 lekin dekhne kaa tareeqa qareeb-qareeb vaisaa hi he
 i realized that the phone gets very hot while watching
 60 degree photo / video dekhne ke liye aapako internet kii speed bhi thik chahie hoti he
 If the internet speed is not good and you are not able to watch in full HD then you will not be able to feel that scene well
 isliye agar aap ise aazmaana chaahate hai to iskaa khyaal rakhie
 Secondly, i also felt that there is still a shortage of good videos through this medium
 zyaadaatar video yaa achche video angrezi main hi hai lekin meraa maananaa he ki jaise-jaise yah madhyam failega vaise-vaise content kii kami dur ho jaaegi
 Overall i want to say that my own experience of watching 60 degree photos / videos with the help of Google's VR headset, controller and VR app was fantastic and i consider this feature / device to be revolutionary in the future
 Will change the way you watch videos
 Asus zenfone AR ke saath ye sambhav hedgar aap padhate hue yahan tak aa gaae hai to iskaa saafe arth yah he ki aapaki ruchi he to sahab ise ek baar aazamaaie or phir aapkaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa yah bhi saajha kiijie

 On 4 November, Somnath was killed by Naxalites on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday

 After this there was a stir from Raipur to Delhi
 haalanki police ne naa to exiaar kii copy sarvajanik kii or naa hi adhikrut rup se hatya main shaamil aropiyon ke naam jaahir kiye
 Why did the Bastar police know so much secrecy
 lekin maamle ne us vakt nayaa mode le liya jab dilli main profesar nandani sundar ne bastar range ke aiji es aar pi kalluri par dushmani bhunaane kaa aarope laga daalaa
 Naxal connection of JNU and DU is a regular movement in Bastar of some of the professors of Delhi
 prophessoron kaa daawa he ki wo yanha research ke liye aate he
 But they never tell that they give details of research and theory
 wo yah bhi nahin bataate kii research kisi faillowship ke andar he yaa phir university ne sambandhit research ke liye unhen adhikrut kiya he
 In Bastar, the professor raises the issue of human rights violations loudly, from Bastar to Raipur and Delhi
 yanha tak kii adaalaton main bhi kai baar utpedan ke maamlo ko lekar chhattisgarh police or sarkaar ko aaropee prophessoron ne gheraa he
 Recently, the Supreme Court lashed out at the Chhattisgarh police during the hearing of the burning of the Adivasi house in Tadmetla
 ye akelaa aisa maamla nahin he jisame rajya sarkaar ko khari khoti sunani padi, kai aise maamlo main iske pehle bhi nandani sundar or archana prasad samet unke kai saathiyo ne police kii pareshaani badhaai he
 On the other hand, the police argue that a section of JNU and DU is working to naxalism in the country
 ye log maanav adhikaron ke ulanghan or farzi muthbhedon kaa aarope lagaakar police or sarkaar ko badnaam karte he
 The police also argue that in addition to the Naxalite police personnel, hundreds of innocent villagers sometimes shoot and sometimes kill them mercilessly with knives and swords
 is dauraan peediton ke maanav adhikaron ko lekar ye profesar chuppi saadh lete he
 Not only this, these professors never filed a petition in the court regarding the arrest of Naxalites accused in any case of teaching Naxalite lessons to school children, breaking school buildings, stopping development work and carrying out violence and arson incidents

 unka aarope he ki bastar main farzi encounter or adivaasiyon ke saath gang rape kii kai ghatnao ko unhone ujagar kiya he
 Due to this, IG Kalluri has got a lot of fajit
 jab unke khilaaf police ko koi maamle nahin mili to aiji ne dushmani bhulane ke liye unka naam exiaar main ghasita
 On the other hand, IG SRP Kalluri of Bastar Range has described these allegations as baseless
 unke mutabik mritak kii patni or kuch ek gavaahon ke bayanon ke baad somnath kii hatya ke aropiyon ke naam exiaar main darj kiye gaye
 According to him, if anyone has any objection, then he can put his point before the investigating officer and other legal options are before him

 In the year 2010, the Supreme Court directed the police to dissolve the Salwa Judum
 graminon se hathiyaar bhi waapas liye gaye
 After this, no organized movement in Bastar came into existence against the Naxalites, although some organizations might be formed in the name of public awareness and repulsing the Naxalites, but they also did not work
 isi varsh may june maah main sukama ke kummacoling gaanv main somnath ne tangiya group kaa gathan kiya, iskaa makasad naksaliyon ko unke gaanv se khadedna tha
 The villagers argued that the Naxalites were killing them without any reason
 yahi nahin unke ilaake main naksaliyon kii maujuudagi ke chalate vikaas ke kaam thap pad gaye
 In a few days people started to unite against the Naxalites and the number of tribals joining the Tangia group progressed quadrupled day and night
