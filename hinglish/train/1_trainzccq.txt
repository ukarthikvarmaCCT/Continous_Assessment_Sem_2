doston se nijee baatcheet main unhone kai baar ke
 Has expressed his disappointment with the selection committee led by Srikanth
 dhoni ke praayojakon kaa prabandhan karne vaali company riti sports management main unke partner arun pandey kehete hai, ‘maine akasar usase kaha he ki unhen apni chintaaen jaahir kerani chahie, lekin mujhe shaq he ki ve bolenge
 'dhoni's old partner and member of Jharkhand Ranji team Santosh Lal says,' i doubt they will be able to fix the situation
 team main koi bhi unke hisaab se nahin sochataa
 Dhoni has also indicated broadly his disappointment
 pichley saal june main england ke khilaaf pehle test ke pehle din jab jahir khan kii nas khinch gai, to dhoni ne apane wicketcaping pad utarkar khud gendbaaji sambhaal lee
 After Khan, there were only three bowlers in the team
 bhartiya team ke purv captain kapil dev kehete hai, ‘jis team main chaar visheshgy gendbaaj the, usamen jakhmi khan ko rakhana jokhim bharaa kaam tha
 After all, why can't they talk to the selectors? ”the answer is that perhaps the selectors do not listen to Dhoni
 pichley saal agast-sitambar main england kii haar ko len
 Dhoni had already warned that the injured players should not be retained, yet the selectors included Khan, Gambhir, Sehwag, Yuvraj and Harbhajan in the squad
 suchi main naam aate hi unhen feet ghoshit kar diya gaya
 But problems started soon thereafter
 pehle khan nas khinchne ke kaaran baahar gaye, uske do match baad gambhir ko janaa padaa
 Sehwag, who was batting with cotton in his ear, later had to go out due to hearing problems
 toote hue anguuthe ke saath pehle yuvaraj or baad main nas khinchne ke chalate harbhajan ko team se baahar nikalnaa padaa
 Gaikwad says, “the selectors should be accountable to the board for this
 ’england main vishwa cap jeetne or ipiel kaa chauthaa sijan khilne ke baad aisa laga jaise bhartiya cricketer kaaphi santusht ho chuke hai
 a Test match was no longer necessary for him
 iespien ke camentator harsh bhogale kehete hai, ‘england main cricket nahin hua, vah to badi party thi
 The Indian cricket team, which lost four Tests, was selected on 26 November in Bangalore
 dhoni ne tamilnadu ke ballebaaj abhinav mukund or harbhajan ko laane ke liye puraa jor lagaaya tha, lekin unki nahin maani gai
 The demand to include his vote in the selection process was also rejected

 Sachin had to be in the team anyway
 in teenon ko rakhaa janaa mahaj bhaavana kaa sawaal nahin he-bisisiai jaanata he ki tivi ke darshak parichit chehron ko hi dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 The result of all this is that Dhoni's leadership has been affected
 ab ve khel ko palat dene vaale shaks nahin rahe, jinke bare main purv australian captain ian chapel kehete hai ki ve kabhi ‘saahasik faisle karte the
 'but experiments are being done now
 perth test main of spinner aar
 Excluding Ashwin, Dhoni took 27-year-old fast bowler Vinay Kumar and only put the fast bowlers on the attack
 bhartiya team ke purv prashikshak gairi karston ne capatoun se india today ko bataaya, ‘australia main dhoni ke haath main kaman nahin thi
 'if a spinner was kept in the team, he would have been out in Perth for at least one day
 gendbaaji ke nae prashikshak dakshin africa erik simons bhi is maamle main baraabar ke doshi hai
 On the other hand, Fletcher, the chief instructor, is clad in silence, to which no one is benefiting
 team main prerak bhaashan dene vaale padi aptan karston ke saath hi chale gaye the
 The entire team looked loose in the field and the fielding was poor, but no one raised a finger on fitness coach Ramji Srinivasan
 test shrinkhalaa ke dauraan kam se kam chaar baar team ne abhyaas nahin kiya
 Instead of sweating the field, pictures of the team resting on the beach of Melbourne gave a glimpse of carelessness
 cricket premiyon ko jo sandesh gaya vah saaf haih paisa berukhi paidaa karata he
 Look at the irony that this money is forcing BCCI to fix things
 board ne australia main hui haar samet kai chizon par charchaa ke liye 12 farvari ko ek baithak bulaai he
 Sourav Ganguly, chairman and commentator of the technical committee of the board has also been called to the meeting to shape the selection at the national level
 ho saktaa he ki dhoni is mushkil main bhi koi mauka talash rahe hon ki board test team ke liye alag captain niyukt kar de taaki ve ekadivasiy or chote sanskarnon par apana dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 If i look at his comment of 31 January, it seems that he has a similar plan, 'captaincy is just a position i am on
 agar meri jagah koi behatar aata he, to uskaa swaagat he
 'his father Pan Singh said in Ranchi that' my son will not cling to anything '
 dhoni ne isse pehle 12 janvari ko test cricket se sanyas lene kaa sanket diya tha taaki ve 2015 ke vishwa cap par apana dhyaan laga saken
 At the BCCI annual general meeting in Kolkata on October 26 last year, different captains were also discussed, but no conclusion was reached
 haalanki is baat ki charchaa aam he ki test ko alavida kehane kii dhoni kii yojana ko bisisiai adhyaksh shrinivasana kaa samarthan hasil he
 The question is, will IPL eat Test cricket in India? It is so certain that it will definitely make players tired
 pichley saal 2 april ko vishwa cap kaa prachaar thamane ke baad se bharat ne 10 test , 20 ekadivasiy or 3 tii-20 khele hai
 In comparison, Australia has played seven Tests, 11 odis and 2 T20s
 us par bhi yah mat bhuuliye ki chiyarlideron, aiyashi bhari partiyon or apane nivesh ko chus lene ke liye betaab team maalikon ke bich aise kai khilaadi hai jinaki tapasya bhang nahin hui he

 Although, the Meteorological Department has predicted rain in the first week of October, but these rains also end by drizzling somewhere
 jisaki vajah se garmi or umas or bad hi rahi he
 Meaning these little thick drizzles fail to bring any coolness

 There is a common story that so far there have been three such apps which have changed the world
 pehla wo jise 'adam' ne khaaya, doosraa wo jo newton ke upar gira or teesraa wo jise steve jobs ne chakh kar duniya ko diya
 Who thought that the passion of a college dropout would make the world crazy so much that it would create the biggest company in the world
 ek aisi company, jiske paas ek vakt america sarkaar ke khajaane se zyada daulat thi
 The amount of wealth that the iphone maker Apple has can be gauged from the fact that if Apple had been a country instead of a company, it would have been the 28th richest country in the world
 
 
 
 
 tab logon ne pagal samjhavarsh 2007 main jab pehla yphone market main aayaa tab bijness phone kii duniya main blueberi kaa jalawaa tha
 One of his biggest strengths behind blackberry's success was its amazing keypad
 tamaam phone banane vaali companiyaan us samay blueberi ke kii-pad kii nakal karne main lagi thim
 In such a situation, when Steve Jobs announced that he would present a phone that would not have a keypad, people thought him crazy
 lekin apni dhun ke pakke jobs ne pehla tach screen phone bana kar duniya ke saamne rakhaa or phir kya hua yah bataane kii jarurat nahin he
 How crazy people are about iphone's iphone and its technology can be gauged from the fact that by buying the phone, people only see that the phone has Apple logo
 haalanki yadi aap yphone ke diwaanon main shaamil nahin he or nayaa phone kharidne kii soch rahe hai to aapke faisle ko aasaan banane ke liye ham kuch baaten bataate hai
 By considering these things, you will be able to decide whether you should taste 'apple' or try another phone
 yphone hi khariden agar
 
 
 
 1
 The brand is very important to you: Big thing is simple
 duniya main tamaam companiyon ke bahut se achche phone hai
 But when new models of another phone are launched, it does not take line overnight outside stores to buy it
 yphone sirf ek phone nahin, ek states simbel he
 Neither cheap plastic nor market glitter
 thos aluminium or hai quality taff glass se bane yphone ko dekhakar hi aap samaj sakate hai ki yphone ke shaukeen logon ko doosraa koi phone aasaani se pasand kyon nahin aata
 If you have an iphone in your hand, without you saying anything, the viewer gets to know a lot about you
 bas naam hi kaaphi he
 There are only two types of people in the world
 ek wo, jinke haathon main yphone he or duusare wo, jinaki ankhon main yphone he
 If the price doesn't matter to you then iphone is for you
 2
 You like a great but small phone: Say no-size Does Matter! This thing also applies on the phone
 yphone jaisaa majboot, khubasurat or shandaar phone doosraa koi nahin he
 If you want to operate mobile with one hand and want that the phone can be easily kept in any pocket, then iphone is excellent
 sirf 4 inch kaa yphone har kisi ke haath main aaraam se feet ho jaataa he
 In the case of touch phones, there is always this fear that if the phone is left by hand, it is from work
 screen tuutane kaa matlab hi he hazaron rupee kaa chuunaa laganaa
 Many days of trouble are different
 yphone kaa sies or shape aisa he ki phone ke haath se chhot kar girane kaa khatra sabase kam he
 In every drop test that is done by deliberately dropping the phone, it has been proved that no touch screen phone can compete with it in terms of robustness
 3
 You want a great photo: don't go to megapixels, you will be deceived
 na hi chamakili, bhadkeeli tasviir se impress hon, acchhee photo kaa ek hi matlab he- ankhon ko jaisi dikhti he thik waisi hi photo
 If you want to see what is the meaning of a good photo, then take a photo from iphone and the same photo from any other camera in the same light
 zyaadaatar phone, kam lite main natural rang vaale photo lene ke maamle main yphone se maat kha jate hai
 This is amazing iphone's amazing lens, sensor and image processing software, which other phone companies do not talk about and only keeps on playing the megapixel
 yahi nahin, photo lekar Instagram jaise App se photo share karnaa ho tab bhi yphone akasar duusare phones par bees baithta he
 4
 aapako adhakachari chizon se chidh harrye tay maane ki yphone ke bheetar jo kuch bhi he, wo kaaphi kade quality control se hokar gujara he
 In this case, the iphone follows the principle of late, correct fit
 har App yahaan jaancha parkhaa or khara hi milegaa
 If you leave the iphone map (which Apple was very upset about), then Apple presents most apps only when all its flaws have been removed during testing
 yphone main android kii tarah na to aae din software apadet kaa jhamela rahata he or na hi aise Apps kaa jo kabhi chalati hai kabhi nahin
 Everything that is here will be smooth like butter
 Security ke maamle main bhi appal, android or windos se zyada bharosemand he
 5
 aap bahut Tech Savvy nahin hai:appal company ye maanati he ki technolaji main dimag lagaana phone banane vaali company kaa kaam he na ki mobile istemaal karne vaale customer kaa
 So if you find such words like Kitkat, ios 7, 64 bit, Octa core, Snapdragon 800 as strangers and you are not interested in knowing them, then you will be benefited by buying an iphone
 na to phone ko apane hisaab se customize karne kaa jhanjhat, na hi tamaam settings kii maathapai
 Just buy the phone, and use it confidently
 
 
 
 So iphone is not for you1
 agar aap Value For Money main bharosa rakhte hai:agar aapako brands ke bajaay Value For Money zyada gaur karne vaali cheez lagati he to appal aapako khatta lagegaa
 Steve Jobs did not become a mere billionaire
 bahut se log maanate hai ki yphone apane stats simbel hone ke badale, hamase behisaab munafa vasuulata he
 If the same work is being done for less money, then why should the price be paid only for the 'logo' of Apple
 64 GB ke yphone 5S kii keemat bharat main 70 hazaar rupee he
 So you can buy a good Android phone and a laptop with it
 appal jise 'sasta' kahata he wo rangabirangaa yphone 5C (32GB) bhi 53,000 rupee kaa he
 Not only this, the company has also updated the worldwide iphone 4, we want to last for Rs 21,000
 ise to bilkul mat khariden
 2
 agar aapako phone main bahut kuch bharne kii aadat he:yaad rakhen yphone main External Memory card nahin lagata
 That is, if you want to store videos, movies, songs, photos around the world inside the phone, then not having a memory card will knock you
 External Memory Card nahin hona isliye bhi bahut chubhta he kyonki memory card kii keemat mahaj kuch sau rupee hoti he jabaki agar aap zyada storage vaala yphone khareednaa chahen, to appal iske liye behisaab keemat vasuulata he
 3
 agar aapako badi or HD screen kaa shauk havezamana badi screen kaa he
 It is difficult to handle a big screen phone, but whether you want to watch a video clip or enjoy Youtube, the big screen is something else
 screen badi ho to tip karnaa bhi aasaan he
 It is reported that the next iphone will come with a bigger screen
 ye bhi bataa duun ki tamaam daavon or vigyaapan kii chamak damak ke baavjood sachai yahi he ki yphone ke sabase mahange model iphone 5S kii screen bhi HD nahin he
 Yes, 'retina display' sounds amazing but it is just a term coined for marketing
 itani keemat dene ke baavjood HD dispale nahin hona shame kii baat he
 4
 agar aasaani se bydaree badalanaa chaahate hai:koi or phone ho to bydaree ke kamjor hote hi aap pados kii dukaan se apane phone kii bydaree kharid kar ek minute main kamjor betry se chhutkaaraa paa sakate hai
 But you can't change the battery in iphone yourself
 aapke ghar ke paas jo mobile kii shop he wo bhi ye nahin kar paaegaa
 For this, you have to go to Apple's service center with your phone
 isliye aapane dekha hoga ki yphone kuch purana hua nahin ki log har vakt charging panit khojate najar aate hai
 Why buy such trouble? 5
 agar aap Credit Card nahin istemaal karteheppal company yah maan kar chalati he ki agar aapke paas yphone he to credit card hoga hi
 This thing can make many people angry because many people in their country do not use credit card on their own free will
 nae phone ko actevet karne se lekar, muft ke apps downlod karne tak, aapkaa yphone baar-baar aapako chidhayega ki aap bina Credit Card vaale insaan hai
 If you do not want to make a credit card just for the iphone and there is a hush in asking friends, do not buy an iphone
 koun sa model khariden:iphone 5S (lagbhag Rs
 50,000 to Rs
 70,000)iphone c (lagbhag Rs
 40,000) iphone 4S (approx
 Rs
 27,000)meri samaj se agar aap sirf yphone ke naam ke diwane nahin hai to ab iphone 4 kharidne kaa koi matlab nahin he
 The writer is the senior reporter to date
 haal hi main uttar pradesh main shiksha mitron jabardast virodh-pradarshan kiya

 There should be one teacher for 30 students
 deshbhar main paryaapt teacher hai
 Actually, the problem lies in deployment
 yani dehaat main jane ko log taiyaar nahin rahete to vahaan kami mahasoos hoti he
 That is why we have instructed all the states to make the deployment correctly
 jahaan kami he un rajyon ko riktiyaan bharne ko kaha he
 Are there more vacancies in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar? No, you are not adding education friends
 shikshak kab tak theke par rakhe jaaenge?har rajya ne alag-alag tareeke se niyuktiyaan kii he
 The system of making almost permanent arrangements has been decided everywhere
 jahaan bina vigyaapan se niyuktiyaan huin, vahaan vigyaapan nikaal kar or pratiyogita ke jariye niyuktiyaan honi chahie
 Are there any instructions given to the states? All the states have been instructed not to remain vacant, have proper deployment, qualification and the performance of teachers should be evaluated
 kai rajyon ke skulon main bijli or anya buniyadi suvidhaon kaa abhaav he
 It is not under our jurisdiction
 praarambhik shiksha ko lekar vyapak tareeke se centre sarkaar kya kar rahi he? artii ko rivyuu kar rahe hai?ham rivyuu nahin, artii ko shashakt bana rahe hai
 We have defined learning outcoms
 isi ke aadhaar par 13 november ko neshnal acesment survey bhi kiya he
 It will happen every year
 duusari baat yah ki 15 lakh shikshak prashikshan puraa kar len
 Third, we have introduced a bill in Parliament to give states the right to take examinations in 5th and 8th, which will be passed soon
 25 rajya pariksha karana chaahate hai or jo chaar rajya aisa nahin chaahate unhen chhot rahegi
 Fourth, CBSE exams in the tenth were optional, which we compulsory
 uskaa bahut phayda hua
 The states say they do not have enough funds for elementary education
 nahin, aisa nahin he
 Three lakh crores in 2014 Rs
 rajyon ko milte the, ab chah lakh karod ru
 Started meeting har saal ajukeshan main 10 pratishat paisa badhanaa he, aisa 14wein vitt ayog ne kaha he
 States who do not do this have a complaint
 centre sarkaar apana paisa sarv shiksha main de rahi he
 When will the National Education Policy come? The draft will be ready by 31 December and will take another month or two after that
 usamen praarambhik shiksha ko lekar kuch vishesh hoga?nishchit rup se use bhi isamen shaamil kiya jayega

 ab dakshin bhartiya superstar rajnikant bhi mega-bajet film 'vishvarupam' ke nirdeshak-abhinayta camel hasan ke saath aa khadey hue hai, or unhone muslim sanghathanon se film ko release hone dene kii apil kii he
 Rajinikanth described Kamal Haasan as his 40-year-old friend and said that Kamal is a man who never hurts anyone
 rajnikant ne shuukravaar ko ek bayaan main kaha, "sensor board se anumati milane ke baavjood camel hasan ne muslim bhaaiyon kii maang ke anuroop unke liye film kii vishesh screening rakhi
 This work of Haasan reflects his love for, and respect for, the Muslim community
 " He said, "I am with him in the problems faced by Kamal, who has invested 100 crores in film production
" camel koi aam kalakaar nahin hai
 He is a great artist who took Tamil cinema to international level
 main muslim bhaaiyon se nivedan karata hum ki ve is maamle main aage aaen or purna pratibandh kii apni maang ko chhod den
 "comments sabhi muslimon ko milad-un-nabi kii shubhakamanaayen dete hue rajnikant ne kaha, "main unase anurodh karata hum ki ve camel ke america se lautne par unke saath baatcheet karen or film kii mul kahani main badlaav kiye bina thodaa sudhaar laakar film ke pradarshan main unki madad karen
 " darasal, 'vishvarupam' ko tamilnadu sarkaar ne muslim sanghathanon dwaara virodh kiye jane ke chalate 'sampradayik sadbhaav banaae rakhane' ke uddeshy se pratibandhit kar diya tha
 Muslim organizations did not find it appropriate to portray Muslim characters in the film
 udhar, camel hasan dwaara is pratibandh ke khilaaf daayar yachika par sunwaayee karte hue madras hoicourt ne bhi kal shaam pratibandh hataane se inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki saptahanth ke dauraan ek jaj film ko dekhne ke baad somvaar ko us par nirnay degaa
 Haasan described the government's ban as 'cultural terrorism' and said that he had never seen a more 'muslim-friendly' film
 rajnikant ne camel hasan ko apana 40 saal purana dost bataaya or kaha ki camel ek aise vyakti hai, jo kabhi kisi ko thes nahin pahunchaate
 Rajinikanth said in a statement on Friday, "despite getting permission from the censor board, Kamal Haasan held a special screening of the film for the Muslim brothers as per their demand
 hasan kaa yah kaary muslim samudaay ke prati unke pyaar, or sammaan kii bhaavana ko darshata he

 i request the Muslim brothers to come forward in this matter and drop their demand for complete ban
 "tippaniyan Wishing all the Muslims the milad-un-nabi, Rajinikanth said, "I request him to interact with Kamal on his return from America and improve the performance of the film by making a slight improvement without altering the original story of the film
" Help them " In fact, 'vishwaroopam' was banned by the Tamil Nadu government for the purpose of 'maintaining communal harmony' due to opposition by Muslim organizations
 muslim sanghathanon ko is film main muslim kirdaaron ke chithran kaa tarika uchit nahin laga
 On the other hand, while hearing a petition filed against Kamal Haasan against the ban, the Madras High Court also refused to lift the ban last evening, saying that during the weekend, a judge will decide on it on Monday after watching the film
 camel hasan ne sarkaar ke pratibandh ko 'saanskrithik aatankwaad' bataate hue kaha tha ki unhone isse zyada 'muslimon kii pakshdhar' film kabhi nahin dekhi he
 He said, "I am with him in the problems faced by Kamal, who has invested 100 crores in film production

 is film ko ab hindi main 'mistar india' ke bawarchi kalandar satish kowshik ne pesh kiya he 'gang of ghosts' ke naam se
 The film poses a problem
 jis tarah se shaharikaran ke naam par kancreet kaa jangal khada kiya ja rahaa he, usase kya garib insaan or prakruti, bhuton tak kaa jeena dubhar ho gaya he
 In order to convey the message clearly, a speech has also been given at the end, by Bhoot Ballamal

 All these ghosts were living in peace

 Love was fighting, holidaying

 Ghosts haunt the ghosts without killing them

 There are some chill types
 kute achche bhoot
 But the things that come out of the mouths of those ghosts should also be chill
 story to acchhee honi hi chahie, jo ki nahin hai
 The film features forced love songs, parodies and item numbers
 zyaadaatar log overacting karte najar aate hai
 Saurabh Shukla and Yashpal Sharma give some relief
 maahi gil kaa kirdaar 'paro main le aayaa, devdas tum le aae' vaali tone apanaae rahata he

 In this election also the Congress stands as a minor party, while the fight is directly between the BJP and Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party
 pichley chunaav main hi hamane aam aadmi party kii hunkaar suni thi or uskaa dam dekha tha
 But in the Lok Sabha elections, the party flew like a leaf and did not get a single seat in Delhi
 saat kii saaton siten lahar main bijepi le udi thi
 The Aam Aadmi Party took this very seriously and then continued campaigning or, say, attacking the BJP
 party ke patibaddh kaaryakarta lagaataar janata se jude rahe or unki samasyaayein sunate rahe, jabaki bijepi kii dilli ikai bante hue ghar kii tarah thi, jisamen aapasi talmail or patibaddhta nahin dikhaai di
 Every leader had his own thinking
 sach to he ki madanlaal khurana or sahab singh verma ke baad bijepi ko dilli main kaddavar netaa nahin mila
 Many party leaders continued to work in their own way
 uskaa hi nateeja tha ki congress virdohi lahar main bhi party dilli main satta main nahin aa saki
 However, now BJP has awakened
 kiran bedi ko siem ummidavaar banane se uski museebataan kam hone kii bajaay badi hi hai
 The party has increased internal infighting
 bedi ek eemaandaar officer rahi hai or rajdhani main unki chhavi bahut hi badhiya he, lekin votaron ko aakarshith karne main ve utani safal nahin ho paa rahi hai
 He has very little grip in the slum areas of Delhi and the Aam Aadmi Party has already set foot there
 zaahir he ki party main ab ek ajeeb sa maahaul he
 But the way she is pouring all her power, it seems that she is nervous
 darasal yah ghabrahat to usee din se he, jab piem modi kii sabha main kursiyaan nahin bharin
 Now the party's surveyor Amit Shah has jumped himself, which shows the seriousness of the matter
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kahin na kahin party ke man main sanshay he
 And if he has to win this election, then first of all he will have to organize his house, otherwise he can get spoiled in the capital

 The controversy between the BCCI and the ICC over the Big Three model has raised a question in the minds of the audience so far whether Team India will be a part of this year's Champions Trophy or not
 is tarah ICC par baari pad sakati he bccibisisiai agar champions trophy se naam waapas letaa he, to keval broadcaster hi nahin balki khud bisisiai ko bhi bada nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he or aise main bisisiai ke paas apni saakh bachaane kaa jo ekmaatr rasta bachataa he, wo he star khilaadiyon ko champions trophy main na bhejkar duusare darje kii team india ko is bade toornament main bhej diya jaae
 If the BCCI does so, it can give a befitting reply to the ICC within the ambit of the rules
 kyonki team bhejte hi isisi bhartiya cricket board par team na bhejne kaa sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa or agar viraat kohli, mahendra singh dhoni, yuvaraj singh or rohit sharma jaise star khilaadi is bade toornament kaa hissaa nahin banegein, to isisi ko darshakon kii naaraazgi jhelni pad sakati he or is sabakaa puraa khamiyaaza bhi isisi ko hi bhugatna padegaa
 The rating of the tournament may be less
 BCCI gives the highest revival to the ICC, the biggest example of this was seen in the 2007 World Cup, when India got out in the group stage and after that the World Cup rating was very low and the broadcaster Had suffered a lot
 bisisiai gharelu cricket main acha karne vaale khilaadiyon ko mauka detaa he, to use bhi cricket phans ke gusse kaa shikaar hona pad saktaa he, aise main yah dekhnaa dilachasp rahane vaala he, ki bisisiai itnaa bada jokhim uthayega yaa nahin

 diggaj BJP netaa gopinath munde kii maut ke maamle main kendriya sadak anusandhan santhaan (CRRI) ne apni report cese kii jaanch kar rahi CBI ko saunp di he
 CRRI has written in its report that Gopinath Munde died due to trees and trees on the road
 siesaiaar ke senior vaigyanik es welmurugan ne bataaya ki haadase kii jaanch main ki bahari kaa haath nahin mila he
 At the behest of the CBI, three CRRI scientists investigated the incident and found that both traffic signals were functioning properly on the morning of the crime
 siararai kii report ke mutabik, gopinath munde kii car kaa accident ped-paudhon kii vajah se hua
 Red light was not visible due to growing twigs of trees and trees along the road, due to which this accident occurred
 bataa den ki 3 june, 2014 dilli main car accident main gopinath munde kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 When he died, he was the Minister of Village Development and Panchayat Raj in Narendra Modi's government at the time
 yah ab tak kaa aisa doosraa saamaanya accident kaa cese he jisamen sibiai ko jaanch ke liye lagaaya gaya
 CRRI scientists submitted the report after examining the Tughlaq road-safdarjung road-aurobindo Road and Prithviraj Road inter sections in Delhi
 report main bataai gai kuch ahm baaten-:* mauka-e-vaardaat par gol chakkar hota to ghatana na hoti
 * Recommendation of roundabout by removing red light signal
 * jin ped-paudhon kii vajah se trephic nahin dikh rahaa unhen kaata jaae
 * Instead of joining the dangerous service road directly into the main road, the merge point should be 50 meters earlier
 * barsaat ke mausam main yaa barsaat se thodaa pehle ped-paudhon kii tahaniyaan kaaphi bad jaati hai, jinhe vakt par trim kiya jaae
 However, 4 years have passed since the death of Gopinath Munde in the car accident and so far neither roundabout has taken place on this route and the measures suggested by CRRI have been adopted
 siararai kii report ke mutabik, rajdhani kii adhikansh sadaken behad khatarnaak hai
 CRRI says that out of about 875 traffic signals, about 70 percent of the trees and plants are not visible
 in trephic signlles par ped-paudhon kii trimming hi nahin hoti
 Even in Aaj Tak's reality check, these traffic signals were found covered with trees -: Aaj Tak's team also turned out to do reality checks on Delhi's roads, based on CRRI report
 ajatak kii team ne kaaphi had tak siararai kii report ko sahi paaya
 In Aaj Tak's investigation, the traffic signals of Delhi which are not visible due to green trees, are: Tilak Bridge bus stand (the board of stops is covered) Shahjahan Road bus stand (the board of government flats covered with trees Is) Humayun Road (on taking the left it appears that the traffic signal is covered with increased trees) New Moti Bagh Square, RK Puram Square IIT Square narda ghotaale main kendriya anveshan beuro (sibiai) ne loksabhaa spikar om birla ko khat likhaa he
 In fact, the CBI wants to name four Trinamool Congress mps - Saugata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Prasun Banerjee and Suvendu Adhikari - in its charge sheet
 iske liye sibiai ne loksabhaa spikar se anumati maangi he
 Even after more than two months, no permission has been received from the Lok Sabha speaker
 sibiai sutron ke mutabik, tiemasi ke chaaron saansadon kaa naam chargeshit main rakhane ke liye loksabhaa spikar ko is saal 19 agast ko khat likhaa gaya tha
 After this, the letter was also taken on 16 September
 lekin abhi tak loksabhaa spikar kii ore se koi pratikriya nahin ai he
 The winter session of Parliament is also scheduled to begin on the 18th of this month

 The police claim that all these accused were trying to escape and during this period all the accused have been killed in the firing by the police
 police adhikariyon ne bataaya ki yah encounter aaj tadake 3 baje se 6 baje ke bich hua he
 According to the information received, after filing the charge sheet in the court, the police took these four accused to the scene to investigate the 'scene of crime'
 lekin unamem se ek aaropee ne pulicekarmi kaa hathiyaar chin kar bhaagane kii koshish karne laga
 Police officials said that if this accused had escaped, a big ruckus would have arisen, so the police had no other way and all the four accused were killed in retaliatory firing
 gauratlab he ki 28 november ko in chaar aropiyon kii jinaki umr 20 se 26 saal ke bich thi, mahila doctor ko toll booth par skuti park karte dekha tha
 It is alleged that these people deliberately punched her

 Faqtu, who was the commander of the separatist union of Kashmir Jamiatul Mujahideen, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of human rights activist HN Wanchoo
 phaktu ko tada ke tahat die gaye ikbaalia bayaan ke aadhaar par doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 The TADA court had done the TADA court of Barizmu in 2001 acquitting Fatu from the murder charge but the Supreme Court overturned the verdict and convicted Fatu
 doshi tehraae jane ke faisle ko phaktu ne supreme court main rit yachika ke madhyam se chunauti di thi
 In this petition, Fatu had said that the confessional statement given to the police was the main basis to convict him, which is wrong
 centre sarkaar ne phaktu kii yachika kaa virodh kiya tha lekin court ne ye kehete hue use khaarij kar diya ki phaktu ne jo mudde apni yachika main uthaae hai, unhen bina vistrut sunwaayee kiye khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa

 On this statement of Pitroda, BJP leaders are constantly besieging the Congress

 He said, "what happened then is there right when someone is driving and we are sitting behind, suddenly if a puppy comes under the wheel, will it be painful or not?" Abdullah made this statement after PM Modi's statement on Congress leader Sam Pitroda's remarks
 pitroda ne kaha tha, '1984 kii bare main ab kya? aapane pichley 5 saal main kya kiya
 It happened in 84 years
 aapane kya kiya?' pitroda ke is bayaan ke baad unhen har taraf se aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The 1984 riots were followed by the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984 in which anti-sikh riots took place across the country in which 3 thousand Sikhs were killed
 “hua toh hua” is right up there with if "someone else is driving a car and we're sitting behind, even then if a puppy comes under the wheel, will it be painful or not?” as callous reactions to mass murder in pogroms
 Let us tell you that Omar Abdullah has taken a dig at PM Modi's old statement by referring to the puppies in his statement
 beete loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan narendra modi se ek intervyuu main poocha gaya tha ki kya aapako gujarat dange main logon ke maare jane kaa dukh he
 In response to this question, he had said, 'if a puppy, that is, a child of a dog comes under the car, there is sorrow

 Mehbooba targeted Prime Minister Modi, tweeting on Monday, a day after his statement
 unhone kaha ki samaj nahin aata ki aakhir kyon pradhanmantri modi itane nichle str par jaakar bayaanbaji kar rahe hai, unhone raajnneetik bahes ke str ko giraane kaa kaam kiya he
 If India has not kept nuclear bomb for Diwali, it's obvious Pakistan's not kept theirs for Eid either
 Don’t know why PM Modi must stoop so low & reduce political discourse to this
 - Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) April 22, 2019 The Congress has also attacked the Prime Minister's statement
 party ke varisht netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki parmaanu shakti hone par puure desh ko garv he, lekin is par pradhanmantri modi kaa badbolapan rashtrahit main nahin he
 Sharma tweeted that the Prime Minister's election speeches showed his distraction from his irresponsible statements and claims by his declining public support

 Now the question is that if Bhajji's bowling lacked rhythm, how did he get included in the team on the crucial series with Sri Lanka? Will Kohli, Shastri or selectors answer this? Harbhajan has caught the rhythm and is bowling well, so why did not anyone see his good bowling in Gaul? harbhajan ipel main lay main dikh rahe the unhen wicket bhi khub mili
 After all, what happened was that he suddenly got out of form

 If 35-year-old Harbhajan did not return to form in time, it would have been difficult for him to remain in the team after the Sri Lanka series, as well as his Test career could also come to a halt

 On December 25 last year at the BJP headquarters in Ashoka Road, when Amit Shah sat with the general secretaries and officials for the 2019 Lok Sabha election preparations, a map of India was placed on his table
 nakshe main har rajya kii loksabhaa siton ke naam or e, bi, si or di shrenee likhaa tha
 The a category seat was considered simple for the BJP and the d class seat was considered difficult
 party mahasachiv arun singh kehete hai, ''2019 ke lihaaj se e or bi shrenee main kaaphi sankhya main aisi loksabhaa siten hai, jahaan bhaajapa apekshaakrit kamjor thi
 Especially in the Coromandel region (odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) we will do well
 hamaare kaaryakartaaon ne apni mehnat se in siton ko saral bana diya he
 "BJP President Shah also confesses in formal and informal conversation that it is not possible to save all the seats of Lok Sabha won by the party in the 2014 elections
 lekin ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''2014 main jeetni siten (282) party ko mili thim, usase kahin adhik siten 2019 main milengi
 "actually, he hopes that the number of seats he is expected to lose in 2019 will be offset by winning the last lost seats
 unka ganit jo bhi ho, magar party main bechaini saaf dekhi ja rahi he
 Sources say that according to the feedback received by the party, the anti-incumbency against the sitting mps in ten states is tremendous
 ye vahi rajya hai, jahaan 2014 main bhaajapa sarvaadhik siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The BJP won all the 69 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Himachal, Delhi, Goa and Uttarakhand

 kai maamalon main gambhir khami yah he ki saansad na to centre sarkaar, na hi sambandhit rajya sarkaar (bhaajapa shasit rajyon main) kii yojanaon ko apane kshetra tak gambhirtha se le gaye hai
 At present, the party is considering forming a cluster of three parliamentary constituencies to change the anti-people sentiment
 aasapaas ke ilaake ke sakriy saansadon ko duusare saansadon kii madad karne ko bhi kaha ja rahaa he
 BJP sources say that about 150 mps have been asked by the party to suggest the names of 2-3 hard working workers of their area in view of the next Lok Sabha elections

 pichley kuch samay se dilli police par apni jimmedaariyaan thik se nahin nibhaane ke aarope lag rahe hai
 To answer these allegations, now Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi challenged Chief Minister Kejriwal for an open debate
 bassi ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha "ye bahes ek se zyada din bhi chal sakati he taaki har tarah kii khaamiyon par baat kii ja sake or kisi bhi tarah ke andeh ke liye jagah naa bache
 i can do this debate alone on the basis of my experience and knowledge of the functioning of Delhi Police without any help
 "iske alaava bassi ne kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, dilli police kii chhavi ko dhoomil karnaa chaah rahe hai, ye to bas dilli main sarkaar banane vaali har party kii tarah police ko apane niyantran main karnaa chaah rahe hai
 Rejecting the allegations leveled against the police, Bassi said that these allegations are really just 'pretense' which is 'necessary' to keep the party under control, such advertisements are helpful in creating confusion
 tippaniyan While fulfilling his point, Bassi said, "if the police say that they are doing good work then nothing will be achieved
" lekin police kii aalochana karke, us par kaabo karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 This is not a new thing, even before that such things have been happening in a hidden, hidden way, but now it is being talked about openly
 " gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri kejariwal kaaphi samay se dilli police ko apane niyantran main laane kii maang kar rahe hai
 The Delhi Police currently works under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs
 ye un muddon main se ek he jisaki vajah se kejariwal kii dilli ko purna rajya banane kii maang ataki hui he
 Delhi Police Commissioner has been expressing his disagreement on this issue from time to time
 bassi ke hisaab se maujuuda vyavastha main koi khami nahin he kyonki pradhanmantri yaa grih mantri kaa dilli main koi nihit swaarth nahin he
 Tampering with the current system would be an injustice to Delhi
 bassi kaa kahana he "main kejariwal se nahin bhidana chahta lekin bas itnaa kahuunga ki dilli police par niyantran karne se police ke pradarshan par bura asar padegaa
 This will increase political interference
 " bataa den ki pichley ek hafte se police or dilli sarkaar aamane-saamne aa gai hai
 In this case, Kejriwal met Bassi, after which the Chief Minister has been accused of criminal defamation by using the word 'thulla'
 apni baat ko puraa karte hue bassi ne kaha "agar ye kahenge ki police acha kaam kar rahi he to kuch hasil nahin hoga
 But by criticizing the police, it is being tried to control it
 ye koi nai baat nahin he, isse pehle bhi aisi baaten dabe, chupe andaaz main hoti rahi hai lekin ab is bare main khulkar baat ho rahi he
 "significantly, Chief Minister Kejriwal has been demanding for a long time to bring the Delhi Police under his control
 philhal dilli police, kendriya grih mantralay ke tahat kaam karti he
 This is one of the issues that has led to Kejriwal's demand to make Delhi a full-fledged state

 Between 1925 and 1960, many unmarried mothers in Western Ireland had to live with their children in the Mother and Baby Home run by the Church for Repentance
 2014 kii ek report main kaha gaya tha ki kadi mehnat or seva ke baad in auraton ko apane jivan main lautne kii ijazat de di jaati thi
 But it was told that some of these children remained there and no one could find out what happened to them
 na hi kisi ne yah jaanane kii koshish kii ki peeche chute bacchon kaa kya hashr hua
 Then a local historian, Catherine Corless, revealed in 2014 after hard-risers that about 700 to 800 of the young children left behind had died and were found inside a structure such as a septic tank, probably under the same Mother and Baby home
 The identity was buried

 Many of these samples are from the 1950s

 At the same time, the committee is also trying to find out how unmarried mothers and their children were treated in 18 religious institutions of the state from 1922 to 1998
 phir ek sthaneey itihasvid catherine corles ne kadi richars ke baad 2014 main khulaasa kiya ki peeche chute chote bacchon main kareeb 700 se 800 kii maut ho gai thi or unhen isi madar and baby home ke neeche, shaayad septic tanks jaise kisi dhaanche ke andar bina kisi pahchaan ke dafn kar diya gaya tha
 Although this report was taken cognizance by the media all over the world, but then it was dubbed with some suspicion

 Apart from this, the commission has said to issue further investigation and has said that it will find out who is responsible for burying the remains of humans in this way

 In the Salaam Sachin Conclave, Vikrant Gupta spoke to Little Master Sunil Gavaskar
 gavaskar ne sachin ke bare main kai baaten bataayin
 Vikrant: We were talking to Sunny Bhai during tea
 unka totaka tha
 He wore new clothes before doing anything good
 har khaas ining se pehle aisa karte
 Today he has come wearing a new shirt
 main kahana chahta hum ki agar sunil gavaskar na hote, to shaayad is desh main sachin tendulkar bhi nahin hote
 Welcome, Sunny brother
 sunil:haa ye sach he ki main kabhi mojey, to kabhi roomaal badal letaa tha
 Thank you very much for inviting me to this event
 mujhe nahin lagata ki sachin ko kisi aisi inspireshan kii jarurat thi
 He was born to play cricket
 har khel main kuch athlete sadiyon main ek hi aate hai
 They are made for that game
 use samrudh karne ke liye bane hote hai
 There are pellets in football
 basketbaal main maaikel jordan hai
 Boxing has Muhammad Ali
 cricket main teen log hai aise, jo khel ko aage le gaye
 Sir Don Bradman, Sir Gary Sobers and Sachin Tendulkar
 pehali baar aapane sachin ke bare main kab suna?sunil:main mumbai airport ja rahaa tha
 Had to catch a flight
 emsisi kaa shatabdi test khelnaa tha 1987 main
 i had a younger brother in my car
 pichley maheene unka dehanth hua
 He then told me about Sachin and Vinod Kambli
 match kii baat karun to unke debyue first class game ko dekha
 He played against the Rest of India
 phir mumbai ke liye ranjai trophy khele
 Both matches saw something
 donon main unhone centuri maari
 Potential was clearly visible
 magar kya unki style bombai skool of batting ke ulat nahin thi?sunil:bombai skool of batting he kya
 All that is needed is never lost courage
 kuch bhi chhodana nahin he
 nothing is easy
 aap dekhie, ab yahi dilli ke saath ho rahaa he
 The best batsmen are coming there
 is khel kii yahi khubsuurati he
 Everyone's approach is different
 mumbai main yahi style thi ki taff khelo
 It was a practice to play on a wet pitch
 vahaan aap haath kaa behatar istemaal sikhte hai
 What is loose in the grip, what should be hard
 hindi main kahawat he ki gavaskar ne indian cricket ko daant die
 Sachin taught cutting
 sunil:sachin ne acchhee tarah se siikhaa he
 You wrote a letter to Sachin in the very early period
 sunil:abhi main uske bare main zyada nahin bataa saktaa
 This secret will open soon
 haa bilkul shuruaati daur main likhaa tha
 But right now i don't want to talk about it
 sani bhai aapane bahut travel kiya he
 Even as a commentator and as a cricketer
 sachin ne jab score kiya, aap vahaan the
 How they were helped
 sunil:ye aapako sachin se poochna hoga
 i was with every player of the Indian team
 jab bhi jisko meri salaah kii jarurat hoti he main bataata hum apni samaj bhar
 Which innings of Sachin do you like more? Sunil: First century
 isse bharat ko test bachaane main madad mili
 Then the century was killed in Perth
 pich mushkil thi
 But they made it simple
 phir chennai main australia ke khilaaf 1998 main
 Then the century against England
 ye mushkil sawaal he 100 shatakon main pasand bataanaa
 What is most special among them? Sunil: His balance on the field
 cricketting balance kii baat karun
 He never appeared on the pitch in an awkward position
 koi ball uchhali
 There was a slip
 vah jaisaa bhi khele
 Did not come as a surprise
 yah to hui field par balance kii baat
 Even after achieving so much, he remained his focus
 anushaasan kaayam rakhaa, samparn banaae rakhaa
 That balance is also amazing
 sanyas se kya aapako aashcharya hua?sunil:nahin aisa nahin hua
 Sometimes you think about it
 ye abhi nahin to agle saal hota
 Sunny brother, you played in the fantastic bowling attack of the atties
 kya sachin us daur main safal hote?sunil:jaisaa don breadman ne kaha
 That Great would remain great in every ira
 main kariyar ke shuruaati teen saal ankaward pich par khelaa, phir game badla
 i think Sachin would have been successful in every IRA
 sachin or aapke game main kya samanta he?sunil:sachin or rahul kii game ke liye taiyaari ameging hoti he
 You are playing at number three and four
 kisi bhi vakt janaa pad saktaa he
 So we are sitting, yet ready all the time
 kai baar aap fielding ke baad dressing room main gaye or kapade yaa juute badal hi rahe hai or bulaava aa jaataa he
 So it takes practice to be prepared mentally
 aap tisare or chauthe number ke player hai, to match kii duusari or teesri ball par hi bulaava aa saktaa he
 Decisions have to be made very soon
 koun sa balla uthaaun
 What kind of condition is on the ground
 sab balle aapke ek jaise hote hai
 But pick one of you
 or acchhee feeling hoti he
 But to decide that
 aapke juuton ke spikes thik hon
 Trousers must be properly tucked in
 ye sari choti choti taiyaariyaan karte the donon
 Plan for everyone in mind
 is bowler kii ye khaasiyat he, to aise kheloongaa
 What will i do on the out swinger? in swinger par kya karuunga
 This is a game of moment
 magar mently har cheez ke liye taiyaar rahanaa bhi jaruri he
 In the nineties, Don Bradman asked his wife for Sachin
 ye ladkaa mere jaisaa kheltaa he
 When did you think this? Sunil: Yes
 nabbe kii baat he
 He was going to tour England
 uski socity sahitya sahavaas ne ek ferewel rakhi thi
 i was called there tab maine vahaan kaha tha ki sachin or bradmen donon kii aawaaj ek jaisi he
 Talk of batting came later
 maine unke kuch video baad main dekhe
 There was equality
 koun zyada mahaan he bradmen or sachin
 
 
 Sunil: You cannot compare different cricket eras
 zyada se zyada samakalinon kii baat kar sakate hai, vah bhi ek hi team ke
 The pitch and team combo is the same for them
 mulk badalane se bhi halaat badal jate hai
 i don't believe in such comparisons
 sachin kii ira kii baat karen to sachin varses lara, sachin varres injamaam jaise daur chale
 
 
 Sunil: They were all very good players
 jab inhone acha kiya inke desh kii team zyaadaatar baar jiti
 He elevated everyone from the game
 24 saal pressure jhelana kitna mushkil he?sunil:pressure rahata he
 Do good for yourself, do for the team
 darshakon ke liye karnaa
 It becomes too much
 jagahon ke hisaab se halaat badalte jate hai
 It is very difficult in this situation
 kya aap apane ritairement ke dauraan chintit the ki aapaki parampara kho jaaegi?sunil:jab aap fast bowling khelte hai to ligesi nahin cervive karne kaa sochate hai
 At that time, do not think of the future
 ek choti si galati se aapaki pasli or haath tut saktaa he
 And i used to play without a helmet because there was nothing in my mind to save
 jab sachin kaa daur shuru hua, to aapako kab laga ki yah meri jagah bhar saktaa he
 Sunil: He was in the middle order initially
 jab 1990 main usne england main centuri banaai
 The team needed someone to play with
 strike lagaataar badale
 Captain make your single stop strategy
 chauthi paanchavi ball par single lekar agle over kii ranneeti banaae
 The same was happening in that match
 us vakt laga ki yah bahut aage kii sochakar khel rahaa he
 All these things are not seen on TV
 magar maidan par hai, to samaj aati hai
 You have heard the story of last two or three years of cricket that did not do much net practice
 sachin ne kaha ki maine pichley do teen saal main sabase zyada practice kii
 Sunil: In my time, the pitch of the net practice was very bad
 dar rahata tha ki practice ke chakkar main kahin injuri na ho jaae
 So if it was in good form, then it seemed that there is no use to play here
 aapane apana aakhri daur khub enjoy kiya form or relax ke lihaaj se
 Sachin has not been able to enjoy for the last two-three years
 sunil: pataa nahin
 He missed a lot of shots
 shaayad albo injuri kii vajah se
 But this did not reduce their impact
 ran to vah kamobesh bana hi nahin rahe hai
 Off the field you must have met Sachin a lot
 sunil: nahin aisa nahin hua he
 He is busy
 aap jaanate hi hai ki kaisaa shedul rahata he
 i said that 35 bottles of champagne have been stored, in memory of the Test match century
 ve kab kholenge
 i remember that we had a competition to eat crab at the Taj Hotel in Colombo
 wo jawan aadmi tha
 has won
 aapane aakhri match 1987 main khelaa tha
 World Cup semi-final
 aap acha khele, par ham haar gaye
 What is the pressure of home ground
 sunil: pressure to hota he, sachin par bhi hoga
 There will be pressure that the fans have come
 ve thik se baith gaye
 BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla is currently here
 main kahana chahta hum
 Every vice president is entitled to three to four tickets for life
 magar purv cricketron ke paas aisa haq nahin hota
 So if Shukla ji can do that at least former captains can get tickets
 kya hit kaa bhi ishu hota he
 You are a player of short stature
 sachin lara itane safal rahete hai
 Sunil: Early in his career there were no aero bridges
 plane land karata tha
 Sir Don Bradman came to receive the Rest of the World Team
 wo aae or bole, whair ij dait little faillo
 Speaking like Sachin, he had a thin voice
 ham kaaphi baat karte rahe
 Sir Garfield Sobers was also there
 vah aae or bole, you little failos aar tugedar
 So the answer came that yes you have got power
 bat ve haev footworkswaal audiyans kii taraf se-aapkaa kya plan tha ritairement ko lekar?sunil: agar meraa vash chalata to main ek saal pehle hi england daure par ritair ho jaataa
 i once went to lunch with Imran Khan
 maine usase kaha ki shaayad main is siries ke baad ritair ho jaaun
 He said, don't do it like this
 vah bolaa, yaar agle saal farvari main pakistan aa rahaa he india
 Let it be a last fight
 pakistan india ko india main haraa de
 And you will not be fun in the team
 maine kaha, mujhe nahin lagata ki aisa daura hoga
 Imran said that no, i know from my political connections
 or phir aisa hi hua
 i understood my retirement when i started watching
 acha tii brake main 15 minute bache hai
 There is so much time left for lunch
 to samaj aa gaya ki abhi kam enjoy karne laga hum
 See, it is not just about the body
 mind kii baat bhi he
 This must have happened with Sachin in the last month itself
 usase pehle vah nahin soch rahe the khel chhodane ke bare main
 What will be the biggest rigt of Sachin's career? Sunil: That match, when he scored
 magar team nahin jeet pai
 Or ever when the team won and could contribute very little
 mere khyaal se parformens se zyada rigelt matter karata he
 When you meet the 1983 World Cup winning team
 to ek feeling of joy rahata he
 If you meet a team with such a famous test win, then thrill remains

 All the parties including All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Samajwadi Party have opposed this action of the police
 is bich, ek video saamne aayaa he
 It is being told that this video has been made by those who oppose Namaz
 video main namaaj padhane kii taiyaari kar rahe logon se pehle parmishan ke bare main poocha ja rahaa he
 Responding to this, people of Muslim society say that we have been teaching Namaz here for 6 years
 yah jameen noida athurity kii he
 Authority has been given 6 years in advance

 usne kaha ki namaaj roj padhate hai yaa shuukravaar ko
 Will you build a mosque here after reading Namaz? Responding to this allegation, the people of Muslim society said why we will occupy here
 ham sirf namaaj padhane aate hai
 In the video, this man named Manoj Sharma is repeatedly asking for a copy of permission
 is dauraan usne kaha ki aap logon ko sector-8, khodaa colony main masjid di he
 Responding to this, the people of Muslim society said that we get half an hour
 aise main sector-8 se jaakar waapas kaise aa sakate hai
 During this, Manoj Sharma said that if tomorrow the Hindu society too starts worshiping somewhere
 is par muslim samaaj ke log bhadak uthe or kaha ki hajaaron jagah kabja kiya hua he
 No Namaj will be held at the park After the video surfaced Noida police made it clear that it is committed to follow the order of the Supreme Court
 park main namaaj nahin hogi
 If anyone tries to offer Namaz then action will be taken against him
 isse pehle noida ke jiladhikari bean singh ne supreme court kaa aadesh he ki kisi bhi public place par koi bhi dharmik kaarykram karnaa he to city magistrate kii anumati lenaa jaruri he
 The police acted under the rules

 The Supreme Court rule applies to all religions

 Acting on this, the police arrested two people

 However, the BJP had clarified that it was a matter of local law and order
 kya safai ke achche din aa gaye hai? isi mudde paragenda ajatakamen swami ramdev, congress netaa jairam ramesh or bijepi netaa minakshi lekhi ne apni baat rakhi
 Here is a conversation with the three leaders in the order of question and answer
 
 
 ramdeohyog ke, ayurveda ke achche din aa gaye hai
 Bad days of black money are coming
 pradhanmantri eemaandaaree se kaam kar rahe hai
 If one village becomes ideal, the other will also be inspired
 jairam rameshaiyah svachh bharat acha kadam he
 But when i said that the temple before the toilet, Ramdev's colleagues opposed me
 mujhe khushi he ki piem ne aavan kiya he
 But this should not be just a slogan
 sawalphapako sirf narebaaji kyon lag rahi he?jairam rameshmphoto aporchunity hi to lag rahaa he
 Public awareness is not going on any longer
 vaajapeyi ji or manmohan ji ke jamaane se chal rahaa he
 This is not the first time
 mujhe khushi he ki piem ke str par in baton ko baar baar doharaaya ja rahaa he
 Ramdev: This is what the Prime Minister can do
 agenda set kar saktaa he
 One hundred and fifty million people have to do it ab mek in india he, to kya modi factory chalaayenge
 Modi ji's track record is what he said he did
 minakshi lekhishyah vipaksh kii aalochana he, ham ise sakaaratmak rup se lete hai
 If people see the celebrity with a broom, their own hesitation ends
 paanch skulon ke bacchon ne buddha jayanti park ko saaf kiya
 i asked the children of those renowned schools
 aap logon ko safai main shame mahasoos hui
 He said, no
 ghar par jhaadu lagaate hai, nahin
 Then said, now you will do the cleaning
 bole, ji
 He said that now we feel a part of cleanliness pride
 safai ko pehle kuch khaas jatiyon se joda jaataa tha
 Now everyone feels that we are all responsible for this
 sawalkshashi tharur ko svachh bharat se jode jane par congress ko aitraaj kyon?jairam rameshaibhi piem baat kar rahe hai
 That's a good thing magar unhen nattejey bhi dene honge

 Meenakshi: i do not agree with Jairam ji
 ye kah rahe, purv main kaam hua
 But not pehle sirf us cote se fund de diya jaataa tha
 People were not connected cleanly
 pehle kii sarkaron ne kagaji yojanaayen deen
 We are making it a mass movement
 corporate bhi pehali baar is str par jud rahaa he
 Question: There is talk of cleanliness, so why is the Government not showing readiness about Ganga? magar jitna chahie tha, utana nahin hua
 Lekhi: Yes, several crores flowed into the Ganges
 ramdeoh duniya bhar main ghumaa
 People had a dirty image of the country in their minds
 modi ne ise focus main liya
 There is a belief in the whole world that India will be clean before their eyes
 jahaan tak ganga kii baat he
 i have been around for a long time
 ganga kaise pradooshan mukt hongi
 Gangotri is sacred
 gomukh main dikkat he
 There were no toilets and waste management
 abhi kaam shuru ho chukaa he
 The water from the toilets in Uttarkashi, Haridwar and Rishikesh is dirty
 iske liye kuch bada sochna hoga
 Lekhi: There is a difference between planning and execution
 jairam ji ne railway main chutki lee
 We also want to make toilet-free rail tracks and run bullet trains
 hamane nai dilli stesan main vaai faai kiya to bio toilet bhi lagaae
 Ramdev: i still believe that it will take 5, 10, 20 years for the whole country to be cleaned, but this too will only happen when we start now
 or jairam ji, tab tak yoga karen
 Now that the UN has given recognition, then yoga has also become secular
 or ek baat
 Did anyone stop the earlier prime ministers from starting the cleanliness drive

 It is good if people are affected by it
 sawaalh kya gandagi failaane par sakht jurmaana ek vikalp he?lekhih main apana kissa sunaati hum

 sisitivi lagavaaye
 Sticker
 marshall baithaae, logon ne steekar ke upar thukna shuru kar diya
 You abuse the municipal body not to pick up the garbage
 magar kooda phenkane vaale to ham hai
 The message will have to be given until people feel ashamed
 logon ko gandagi failaane waalon kii tasviir khinchakar twitor or fasebuk par daal deni chahie
 Jairam Ramesh: An tribal woman went to the in-laws' slogan in Betul
 vahaan shauchalay nahin tha, to vah laut ai
 We had campaigned
 shauchalay nahin, to dulhan nahin
 Then these people criticized him
 haryana main bhi abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 To say that every green thing has been invented after Modi ji
 usase hamen dikkat hai
 Ramdev: It is not just the government's responsibility
 logon ko bhi judsa hoga
 And law will also have to be made
 singapore dekhie
 How strict is the law there
 or ye jo jairam ramesh baar baar shauchalay kii baat kar rahe hai
 Will the man spit by going to the toilet

 Jayaram: Yes, because i do not eat Baba Ramdev's churan

 The industrialists should decide that their industry should not cause pollution

 People collect dirt in one place

 Third, people go to the market, then take the bag with you

 This is not possible in the city
 makasad pehle kii vyavastha bataane kaa he
 Question: Will there be a difference in five years? Lekhi: Five years, the difference is beginning to show
 chah maheene baad ek diplomat bharat aae
 He said after walking, i am really seeing a difference
 sawaalh kaale dhan kii baat par baba ramdev ne andolan chhod diya
 There was talk of 1 lakh 56 thousand crores

 Why are you silent? Baba Ramdev: i speak, then i say why Baba speaks
 abhi chup hum to dikkat he
 Silent, because i know work is happening
 raju shrivastavah modi ji ne ek din subah mujhe sharminda kar diya
 i was sleeping and Modi ji nominated me after cleaning in Benares
 tivi par naam aayaa, to gharavaalon ne jagaaya
 Then i vowed

 US media and intelligence agencies said that Al Qaeda has established a new branch in the Indian subcontinent to start jihad in India and restore its caliphate and implement Sharia

 Indian cricketer Suresh Raina revealed about former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni during an event
 unhone bataaya ki dhoni camere ke saamne gussa nahin karte lekin camera hatate hi wo daantate hai
 MS Dhoni has now given his reaction to this disclosure of Raina
 jammu-kashmir main bhartiya sena ke ek kaarykram main unhone kaha main maidan par zyada mazaaq nahin karata, lekin dressing room main main kaaphi enjoy karata hum
 i manage myself the way i think
 dhoni bole ki maidan par aap ek agal zone main hote hai
 Explain that in a web series, Suresh Raina has disclosed an old talk of former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni that once Mahi asked him to sled Pakistan batsman Umar Akmalco
 darasal, kissa yah tha ki us match main pakistani team lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi thi or akmal krij par ballebaaji kar rahe the
 Then Akmal complained to Dhoni that 'I am abusing him
 raina ne dhoni se kaha ki maine aisa kuch nahin kiya he, tab dhoni ne mujhase poocha ki kya hua
 i said that i was just trying to put pressure on Akmal
 iske baad dhoni ne mujhase kaha ki use or uksaao or dabaav daalo
 Dhoni always has three planners who told him that Dhoni understands the game very well, he knows what is going to happen next and accordingly he makes his strategy
 raina ne kaha ki dhoni hameshaa maidan par teen ranneeti ke saath jate hai, phir chaahe wo fielding kar rahe hon, batting kar rahe hon, wicketcaping kar rahe hon yaa phir captaini kar rahe hon
 a holiday was declared that day on the birth anniversary of Maharana Pratap
 chuttee bhala kise akharati he
 But on 7 May, 42-year-old Chandraprakash, a reviewing officer working in the UP Secretariat, suddenly realized that he sat down to calculate his vacation
 rajya mukchayalayon main shanivaar-ravivaar, do din kaa saptahik avkaash hota he
 That is, 104 days off throughout the year
 iske alaava 33 dinon kii 'arne live' or 14 dinon kaa aakasmik avkaash
 This was followed by a total of 38 public holidays and two days of unrestricted holidays during the government's declared year
 chandraprakash kii ankhen khushi or aashcharya se chaudee ho gayi
 The total deposit for the holiday was 191 days
 par is varsh 10 saarvajanik avkaash ravivaar yaa shanivaar ke din pade
 Excluding these, a total of 181 days of leave were recorded in the account
 chandraprakash kehete hai, ''agar main apni sari chhuttiyon kaa upbhog karne par utar aauun to chah maheene kaam karke saal bhar kii tankhwaah uthaa saktaa hum
 “one of the politics of UP is also the politics of holidays
 lagaataar nai chhuttiïyon kii ghoshnaa ho rahi he
 Holiday days are increasing and working days are getting shorter
 9 may ko maharana pratap jayanti par chuttee ghoshit hone ke baad pradesh main saarvajanik avkaash kii sankchaya 38 ho gai
 UP is the first state where the number of public holidays has been more than a month
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jaateey sameekaran durust karne ke liye akhilesh yadav sarkaar siyasat kii shatranj par chhuttiyon kii bisaat bichaane main jute gai he
 Right now, the SP has spent more than three years sitting on the chair of UP and in the same time the government has increased the list of public holidays by half a dozen
 rajnatik vishleshak ise siyaasi dalon kii 'pratikon kii raajnneeti' qaraar dete hai
 The head of the Department of Political Science at the prestigious Shibli National College, Azamgarh, Dr
 gyas asad khan kehete hai, ''samaajawaadee party ko 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle aise pratik chahie, jisase uskaa janaadhar majboot ho sake
 The politics of leave is also not untouched by this
 chunaav ke najadik aate-aate yah or teji pakad le to aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 "before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SP tried to woo Brahmins on the pretext of Parshuram Jayanti
" 2012 main sapa sarkaar banane ke baad pichhali mayawati sarkaar ke samay parashuram jayanti par shuru hue saarvajanik avkaash ko na keval barkaraar rakhaa gaya, balki us din sapa ke pradesh mukhyalay main jalse bhi hue
 But after being reduced to five seats in the Lok Sabha elections, the SP changed its strategy significantly
 parashuram jayanti bhula di gai
 By declaring a holiday on the birthday of former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar on 17 April, the SP started its best efforts to bring the Kshatriyas into its court
 iskaa siyaasi laabh lene ke liye chandrashekhar kii jayanti par party mukchayalay main kshatriya sammelan kar sarkaar ke prati aabhaar prakat kiya gaya
 But the matter did not end here
 chandrashekhar jayanti ke thik 10 din baad 27 april ko sapa sarkaar ke graamy vikaas rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) arvind kumaar singh 'gop' ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke saamne kshatriyon ke swabhimaan se jude maharana pratap kii jayanti, 9 may, par avkaash ghoshit karne kii maang rakh di
 Showing its activeness in increasing the proximity to the Kshatriyas, the order was issued within 10 days
 phir kya tha
 The neglected bronze statue of Maharana Pratap, present at the Hussainganj intersection of the assembly road in Lucknow, was lost on the day
 sarkari karinde isaki saaf-safai main jute gaye
 After the theft, the statue, lying without a spear for two years, got a stainless steel spear
 jayanti vaale din is pratimaa ko maala pehanaane ke liye sapa ke kai bade-chote netaaon kaa tantaa laga rahaa
 Arvind Kumar Singh, who is emerging as a Kshatriya face in SP, says, "the courage to declare a holiday on the birth anniversary of Maharana Pratap is only among the socialists
" chhuttiyon se nuksaan nahin hota, balki prerana milti he
 "the focus of the Janata Parivar is on the most backward castes in the political agenda of the SP
 isiilie akhilesh sarkaar ne maharishi kashyap or nishad jayanti par saarvajanik avkaash shuru kiya
 Announcing the holiday on the birthday of former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur, who belongs to the most backward castes, Nai (savita) caste, sp's national president and now Janata Parivar chief Mulayam Singh Yadav hit two targets with one stone
 is kadam se mulaayam ne ek ore janata parivaar ke netaaon ke bich apana kad badhaayaa to duusari ore upi main ati pichhadi jatiyon kaa himachati banane kii koshish bhi kii
 Not only this, after the Lok Sabha elections, the SP, which was trying to save the Jat vote bank in the West, made a very strategic bet by announcing the holiday on the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh last year
 iske jariye mulaayam ne sansad kii dahalij tak nahin pahunchane vaale areldi ke rashtriya adhyaksh ajit singh kii na keval pareshaani badhaai, balki inhen janata parivaar kii ekta se dur rakhane main bhi kaamyaab rahe
 Ajit Singh is also known to belong to the Chautala-led Indian National Lok Dal in the Janata Parivar
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad hue vidhansabha upachunaav main jis tarah sapa ko daliton kaa samarthan mila tha, use aage bhi barkaraar rakhane ke liye mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne dow
 Announced the holiday on Bhimrao Ambedkar's Parivirvan Divas
 khaas baat yah he ki mayawati sarkaar kii shuru kii gai isi chuttee ko pradesh main sapa sarkaar banane ke turant baad band kar diya gaya tha
 Says BSP president Mayawati, "SP mlas who won from reserved seats put pressure on that closed holidays and schemes should be resumed in the name of Ambedkar otherwise they will move to BSP
" "vivaadon kaa sayapichley saal 29 disambar ko saamaanya prashasan vibhaag ne jaise hi purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar kii jayanti par 17 april ko saarvajanik avkaash kii ghoshnaa kii, ek vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Some people raised questions on the holiday, saying that in the government documents registering Chandrasekhar's birthday on July 1
 jaanch ke baad pataa chalaa ki vaastavik janmdin 17 april ko hi he
 July 1 is the paper date
 iske baad mukchay sachiv alok ranjan ne 17 april ko hi jayanti manaane kaa aadesh jari kar diya
 The issue of the ever increasing public holidays has now reached the court as well
 artiai activist nutan thakur ne hycourt main yachika daayar kar pradesh sarkaar ke saarvajanik avkaash ghoshit karne ke taur-tareekon par sawaal uthaae hai
 She says, "the SP government is violating section 24 of the Negotiable Instrument Act" in declaring a public holiday, which is a serious matter
 " 9 may ko maharana pratap kii pratimaa par maalyarpan karne pahunche rajyapal ram nik ne bhi chhuttiyon kii manshaa par apni chintaa jaahir kii
 He says, "policy should be made for the holidays to be declared on the birth anniversary or death anniversary of great men
" chhuttiyaan mouj-masti ke liye nahin hai

 Yogendra Yadav's party Swaraj India has received a major setback from the Delhi High Court

 But Pradyumna protested and killed her
 lekin sibiai 11veen ke is chaatr ko tab tak hiraasat main nahin lenaa chaah rahi thi jab tak puri tarah se mutmain na ho jaae
 So her friends at school were first talked to
 is baat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kii gai ki kya pradhymn kii hatya ke baad us chaatr ke bartaav main tabdili ai thi
 During interrogation, not only that student's friends but his parents themselves changed the behavior of Tasdeek's student after this
 sibiai kii maane ne ladke ne qatl se pehle apane doston se bhi kaha tha ki wo pariksha kii taiyaari na karen, kyonki skool main chuttee hone vaali he
 Now his family are saying that he is not making any sense with the present murder but is trying to trap him
 haalanki is maamle kaa doosraa pahalu ye bhi he ki aaropee chaatr ilaake ke rasukhdaar logon main se hai or shaayad uske parijanon ko apane bete ke bartaav se andaaza lag gaya tha ki maamle main kuch gadabad he
 a case of murder of Pradyuman was registered against the accused student under section 302
 jiske baad aaropee chaatr ko sibiai ne juvinil justise court ke saamne pesh kiya gaya
 From where the court sent him on remand

 Sadruddin, who came to the shop to offer Namaz, says that after the mosque broke, people were scattered, had to go to different places to offer Namaz
 isaliye hamane ilaake main chamade ke kaarobaari deepak kaale se baat kii or vah maan gaye
 He gave his two and a half thousand feet of land to the mosque without any rent
 ilaake main itani zamin kaa kiraaya hazaron main he
 It has been five months since then we are offering Namaz in this shop
 vyapaaree hone ke saath saamaajik kaaryon me bhi ruchi lene vaale deepak kaale kaa kahana he ki aasapaas ke sabhi log unke mitra yaar hai
 So when he asked for a place to offer Namaz, he gave it
 vaise bhi ye jagah khaali padi thi
 Kale has not only provided space, he has also arranged for light, fan and wju
 nur maszid se jude gupran kaa kahana he ki hamane sirf 2 maheene ke liye baat kii thi lekin 5 maheene ho gayi hai, ham isi jagah par namaaj pard rahe hai
 Deepak Kale never said anything
 ye badi baat he
 Atiullah Chaudhary did not hesitate at all, saying that we do not even give such a big place to offer Namaz for free, but Deepak Kale, despite being a Hindu, gave it without reading anything
 ham inke shukraguzaar hai
 We will go back to it once the mosque is completed
 khaas baat he ki is imaarat kaa naam jai bajrangbali houseing sosayadi he or iskaa adhyaksh ek muslim he
 This news of hindu-muslim brotherhood is nothing short of a gust of cold air that gives relief from the deadly heat
 sampradayikta kii garmi main jhulas rahe desh ko aaj aise hi thandi hawa ke jhonke kii jarurat he
 We are talking about Mukund Nagar of Dharavi, which is called Asia's largest slum
 yahaan kii jai bajrangbali sosayadi ke ground floor kii dukaan main dopaher kii namaaj ho rahi he
 This is because the nearby Noor mosque is under reconstruction due to which the Namazis were in trouble
 dukaan main namaaj padhane aae sadruddin bataate hai ki maszid tuutane ke baad log bikhar gayi the, namaaj padhane ke liye alag-alag jagahon par janaa padataa tha
 So we spoke to Deepak Kale, a leather trader in the area, and he agreed
 apni dhai hazaar foot kii zamin masjid ko de di wo bhi bina kisi kiraaye ke
 The rent of this land in the area is in thousands
 paanch maheene ho gayi hai tab se ham isi dukaan main namaaj pard rahe hai
 Deepak Kale, who is a businessman and also interested in social work, says that all the people around him are his friends
 isaliye jab unhone namaaj padhane ke liye jagah maangi to de diya
 Anyway, this place was lying empty
 kaale ne sirf jagah hi nahin di, usamen lit, pankhaa or vuju kaa intazaam bhi kiya he
 Gufran, who is associated with Noor Masjid, says that we only talked for 2 months but it has been 5 months, we are studying Namaz at this place
 deepak kaale ne kabhi kuch bhi nahin kaha
 This is a big deal atiulla choudhary ye kehete hue jaraa bhi nahin jhijake ki namaaj padhane ke liye itani badi jagah muft me hamaare apane bhi nahin dete, lekin deepak kaale ne hindu hokar bhi bina kisi likhaa padhi ke de diya
 We are thankful to them
 maszid kaa kaam puraa hote hi ham waapas usamen chale jaaenge
 The special thing is that the name of this building is Jai Bajrangbali Housing Society and its president is a Muslim
 hindu-muslim bhaichaare kii ye khabar thandi hawa ke us jhonke se kam nahin jo jaanaleva garmi se raahat detii he
 The country, which is scorched in the heat of communalism, needs a stroke of cold air today
 vyapaaree hone ke saath saamaajik kaaryon me bhi ruchi lene vaale deepak kaale kaa kahana he ki aasapaas ke sabhi log unke mitra yaar hai
 So when he asked for a place to offer Namaz, he gave it

 Kale has not only provided space, he has also arranged for light, fan and wju

 In such a situation, the exercise of alliance between RLD and Congress has intensified
 is sambandh main areldi ke upaadhyaksh jayant choudhary ne congress mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh ke party prabharee jyotiraditya sindhiya se do baar mulaakaat kii he
 Jayant Chaudhary told Aaj Tak that his party is part of the SP-BSP grand alliance in the RLD province
 philhal mahagathbandhan se alag hone kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 However, regarding the seats, RLD definitely wants that it got more seats
 lekin areldi mahagathbandhan main he or rahegi
 The RLD may be openly saying that it is part of the grand alliance, but the way RLD and Congress leaders are meeting inside
 wo kai sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 Jayant Chaudhary has met him twice after becoming Jyotiraditya Scindia in charge of western Uttar Pradesh
 sindhiya ek baar jayant choudhary ke ghar dinar par aae
 While for the second time Jayant Chaudhary went to Jyotiraditya Scindia's house to drink coffee

 In such a situation, we have all the options of the alliance open
 congress ke saath jane main hamen koi harj nahin he
 In fact, the Congress wants to have a larger alliance in Uttar Pradesh in response to the SP-BSP alliance
 aise main vah or areldi ko pashchimi uttar pradesh main apane gathbandhan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahati he
 The Congress feels that if the RLD leaves the SP-BSP alliance and joins the Congress, then the competition will be very tough
 darasal upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke elaan ke hue ek maheene se zyada kaa samay guzar chukaa he, lekin siton ko lekar ghoshnaa nahin ho saki he
 However, the SP-BSP has left the Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar Lok Sabha seats for the RLD
 iske alaava sapa ke apane cote se mathura seat dene kaa ofer kii baat bhi saamne ai thi
 Though the SP is talking about putting its candidate as RLD candidate in Mathura seat, Jayant Chaudhary wants one more or the fourth seat apart from these three seats, which has not been finalized yet

 sabhi aaropee abhi faraar hai
 The idea of falling under a packed flight with passengers makes the story creep, but when a conspiracy comes up behind such an incident, the case becomes even more frightening
 misr main gire russian plane kii kahani ab jaise-jaise saamne aa rahi he khauf ke kuch aise hi rahasy khul rahe hai
 The mystery, whose plot was undoubtedly created on the ground, but the result was seen in the sky
 misr ke shame-al-shaikh hawaii adde se udaan bharne ke mahaj 23 minute baad 30 hajaar feet kii oonchai par tut kar bikharane vaale russian hawaii jahaaj airbas e-321 kaa rahasy ab dhire-dhire khulne laga he
 From the route of this flight to the site of the crash, the investigative officers who searched the rumor have some clues that have led to suspicion and confirmation that there may be a conspiracy behind the incident
 ye baat tab or ahm ho jaati he jab haadase ke fouran baad isaki jimmedaari lenevaala aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas dobaaraa apni baat doharaata he or ye kahata he ki wo vakt aane par duniya ko batayega ki aakhir unhone russian airbas main bam kaise plant kiya tha
 The accident is the brainchild of terrorists? a total of 224 people, including 7 crew members, were killed due to the crash of this airplane from Egypt to Russia's St
 Pittsburgh on the morning of 31 October
 chunki hawaii jahaaj main zyaadaatar russian musafir savaar the or haadasa iesas ke dabadabe vaali ek jagah par hua tha, logon ko shaq ho chalaa tha ki iske peeche iesas kaa haath ho saktaa he
 But after a few hours, ISIS took responsibility for the incident and the world began to believe that this incident was probably the brainchild of these terrorists
 haalanki shuruaati jaanch main zyaadaatar agenciyon or kai mulkon ne iesas ke is daawey ko khaarij kar diya tha
 In fact, then he said that ISIS does not have a dreaded weapon or missile like shooting down an airplane flying at an altitude of 30 thousand feet
 maamle kii tafteesh ke dauraan tamaam jaanch agenciyon ko jo suraag haath lage hai, usase lagane laga he ki iesas kaa ye daawa shaayad jhootha nahin tha kyonki in suraagon par jaaen to iesas se plane neeche se maar nahin giraaya balki udne se pehle hi usamen bam plant kar diya
 If the investigating officers are to be believed, the photos themselves tell the plot of this incident and the whole story of it
 pehali tasviir plane ke chalni hue pade ekaimergencydor kii he
 That is, there are many small holes on this door, which are not possible in a missile attack usually caused by a downward flight or a technical fault, but these holes in the door are proof that the splinters that have come out of the bomb blast
 These marks have been made due to injury
 russian plane krash kii ab tak kii tafteesh se ek baat to saaf he ki ye jahaaj aasmaan main hue bam dhamaake kii vajah se hi neeche aa gira
 It is also clear that the bomb was placed at the Sharm el-sheikh Airport in Egypt, but who placed the bomb, how and when it was placed under such tight security
 puri tafteesh ab, bas inhen sawaalon ke ird-gird gum rahi he
 As the story of the flight metrojets being razed is unfolding, many countries in the world have begun to strategize for the protection of their passengers, with the terrorists finding this new betting scandal
 britain ne jahaan laal sagar kaa najaara dekhne gaye apane tamaam shahriyon ko misr se waapas bulaane kii shuruyaat kar di he, vahiin yues kii top security unit yani pentagon ne bhi apane shahriyon ko salaah di he ki wo philhal sinai or aas-paas ke ilaakon kaa rukh naa karen
 This is the situation when the investment so far has started to indicate that there is no technical fault, but the explosion in the air is the reason behind the fall of this Russian flight
 duusare tamaam subooton ke saath-saath blike box main bhi dhamaake kii aawaaj record hui he or is khulaase ne ab tak iesas ke khilaaf morcha khol rahe tamaam mulkon ke haath-paanv phula die hai
 But it is not just that
 iesas ke kuch aatankwaadiyon ne soshal media par jari apane ek nae video main is hamale ko anjaam dene kii baat kehete hue iske liye sinai bros yani sinai main koharaam machaa rahe aatankwaadiyon ko mubaarakabaad di he, vahiin ye bhi kaha he ki aane vaale dinon main wo saaf karenge ki ye hamalaa aakhir kaise kiya gaya
 In this video, ISIS militants waving knives are speaking in Arabic as well as Russian language
 or bataa rahe hai ki agar rus ne syria main apane hamalon kaa silsilaa band nahin kiya, to aanevaale dinon aise or bhi hamale honge
 On the other hand, after the investigation so far, the investigating officials have almost made it clear that the terrorists had fitted this bomb at Sharm el-sheikh Airport in a flight bag or somewhere else on the plane
 lekin ye kaise mumkin hua, ab iskaa pataa karne ke liye police airport ke tamaam sisitivi footage ke saath-saath flite main savaar honevaale musafiron ke saath-saath airport par kaam karanevaale mulajimon kaa becoground bhi check kar rahi he
 Actually, the security agencies now want to know who was the bomber in the flight and what was his trick to penetrate the security layer? Obviously, it is also a big challenge for the agencies to find out that after the suicide bombing by a suicide bomber, then the planter bomb managed to escape by sneaking off the plant
 hawa main hi dhamaakaa hua?rus se iesas kii dushmani nai nahin he, lekin jis tarah se usne syrian raashtrapati bashar al asad ke kehane par syria main 30 sitambar se lagaataar bam baari kar rahi he, usne iesas or rus ko bilkul aamane-saamne laakar khadaa kar diya he
 And this condition forces the belief of isis's hand in falling down with this Russian airplane blast
 vimaan ke malbe kii jab export ne jaanch kii to kuch chijen badi chaunkaane vaali milin
 As the body of the rear of the aircraft was coming out from inside
 aisa tabhi hota he jab koi taqatvar bam fate
 Whereas after falling on the ground, the body of the aircraft should be sunk inwards
 export kii maananaa he ki isse saaf lagata he ki plane ke andar hawa main hi dhamaakaa hua tha
 According to the eyewitnesses who went to the place where the debris was found, the plane fell on the ground in two pieces and this is possible only when the plane has exploded in the sky
 wo bhi kisi bam se
 While some people say that two pieces of the aircraft were in the sky but those pieces were caused by a missile fired from the ground, but the missile hit from the ground to the sky is possible up to 23000 feet
 isse oonchai par nahin
 While the aircraft was at an altitude of 30 thousand feet at the time of the accident
 jahaan tak takneekee kharabi kii baat he to kaha ja rahaa he ki udaan bharne ke baad payalat ne takneekee kharaabi ke chalate immergency landing kii baat kahi thi
 But immediately lost contact with him
 jabaki malbe se mili vimaan ke blike box kii shuruuaati jaanch bataa rahi he ki vimaan main koi andruni takneekee kharabi nahin thi
 What is the truth of the plane crash? Now the question arises that what is the truth of this plane crash? ISIS claimed that it had dropped the airplane, but it is not possible if the experts believe it
 kyonki jab hawaii jahaaj haadase kaa shikaar hua wo kareeb 30 hajaar feet kii oonchai par ud rahaa tha or ab tak iesas ke paas aisa koi anti aircraft gan yaa sarphase tu air mixil nahin he, jo itani oonchai par ud rahe kisi plane ko apana nishaanaa bana sake
 In such a situation, there is nothing to deceive the world except this claim of ISIS
 lekin iske baavjood exparts ne is haadase ke peeche kisi sajeesh se inkaar nahin kiya he
 Rather, after the initial investigation of the wreck, he says that it is very possible that there is a conspiracy like a bomb blast in the air behind this accident
 yani shaq is baat kaa he ki hawaii jahaaj main pehle se hi bam rakhaa hua tha
 This is also being said because some pieces of the back of the airplane found in the desert of Sinai are turned inwards
 or aisa tabhi mumkin he jab andar se koi taqatvar teji se baahar kii ore nikle
 And this usually happens in a bomb blast
 is vaardaat ke baad duniya main iesas kaa khauf kitna badha he, iskaa andaja sirf isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki britain samet kai mulkon ne misr main fanse apane shahriyon ko vahaan se nikaal laane ke liye baqayada helpline number tak jari kar die hai
 And in such a situation, the Egyptian tourism industry has suffered a severe blow

 '' aatishi ne aarope lagaaya ki gambhir ke paas rajendra nagar or karol baag ke do matadaata pahchaan patr hai or unhen is aparaadh ke liye ek saal tak kii kaid kii sajaa kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Controversy continues about Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat, which is releasing on January 25
 ab ek ek kar kai rajya philam ko bain kar rahe hai
 After Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, now the Khattar government of Haryana has also made an official announcement to ban the film
 iske alaava or bhi kai rajyon main ye film bain ho sakati he
 It is clear that the film Padmavat may face losses at the box office
 padmavat: kya dhamkiyon se dar gaye nirmaataa? sitare nahin karenge film kaa pramotion25% tak ho saktaa he nuksaanapadmavat ke mekars kii pareshaaniyaan abhi or bhi bad sakati hai kyonki film ko box offis par bain ke chalate ghaataa hone kii puri ummid he
 According to the news, the film may face a loss of up to 25% at the box office due to banning of the film in the three Hindi speaking states
 darasal box offis par kisi bhi hindi film collection main rajasthan se 5 se 6 pratishat kaa yogadan rahata he, gujarat se 10 se 11 pratishat or madhyapradesh se 4 se 5 pratishat kaa munafa hota he
 If this film was released in these states, then obviously the film's earnings figure is even bigger
 is tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki film ke kuj revenue main 25% tak yaa isse bhi zyada ke nuksaan ke liye mekars ko taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 If violence happens, there may be banning of Padmavat in other states
 In these 3 states (gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana) but also in Himachal Pradesh and Goa, the news about the ban of the first film was discussed
 haalanki in rajyon main bain ko lekar koi aadhikarik ghoshnaa nahin kii gai
 Now the question arises that will the other states also ban the film? The possibility of this happening can also be expressed because if violent incidents are big after the release of the film, then maybe the rest of the state also announces the ban due to security reasons
 haryana main bhi film 'padmavat' bain, ab tak in rajyon se mil chukaa red signlapedman se bhi bada nuksaanjo film saal kii sabase badi blockbster kahalaane vaali thi use ab lag rahaa he baaki relies hone vaali filmon kii chunauti kaa bhi saamana karnaa padegaa
 Akshay Kumar's Padman, which is going to release along with Padmavat, is also a big challenge for Padmavat's makers
 isaki ek badi vajah ye he bhi he-akshay kumaar kaa pedman ke pramotion ke liye ji jaan lagaana
 On the one hand, in the promotion of Akshay Padman, there are loud noises, while on the other, the stars of Padmavat have been instructed not to promote the film
 charchaa he ki film padmavat ke mekars ne deepika padukon, ranvir singh or shahid kapur ko film ko pramot nahin karne ke liye kaha he
 The makers probably do not want any more controversy over the film
 is tarah se film padmavat ko jaise-taise relies karne main to safalataa mil gai lekin shaayad puure desh main film ko relies karne kaa mekars kaa sapana ab dub rahaa he
 In the coming time, let's see what new decisions come about the film between the state governments and the makers of the makers? spain nirmit talgo train ne shanivaar ko takneekee gadabadi ke kaaran mumbai kii apni yatra nirdhaarit samay se 17 minute kii deree se puri kii

 When it comes to the border dispute that continues around the world, this list is extremely long and always changing
 is vakt asia, africa, europe or america mahadwipon milakar duniya main 150 se zyada jagahon par swaamitv ko lekar vivaad chal rahaa he
 These include some very old border disputes like Jammu and Kashmir, israel-palestine, and some new and burning disputes like Crimea, which are causing war-like situations
 yahaan ham aise hi kuch pramukh seemaa vivaadon par najar daal rahen, jisane saal 2016 ke dauraan vishwa raajnneeti main khaasi halchal machaai
 
 
 Jammu and Kashmir - Since the independence of India and Pakistan from the British rule, tension has remained in both countries over the right to this part
 jameen ke is tukade ko lekar bharat or pakistan ke bich ab tak 1947, 1965, 1971 or kargil ko milakar teen baar yuddh ho chuke hai, lekin donon deshon ke bich kii kareeb 740 kilometre lambii seemaa ko lekar vivaad jas kaa bas barkaraar he
 At present, parts of Jammu, Kashmir Valley, Ladakh are under the jurisdiction of India, while parts of gilgit-baltistan, Mirpur, Muzaffarabad are occupied by Pakistan
 bharat-china seemaa vivaad- bharat or china ke bich yun to 1914 main macmohan rekha ke jariye seemaa kaa nirdhaaran kiya gaya tha, lekin china is simarekha ko nahin maanata he
 There is a dispute between the two countries over the 4000 km long border
 iske saath hi china arunachal pradesh par bhi apana daawa karata he
 On the same border dispute, China also attacked India in 1962 and even today, there are many attempts to infiltrate the Chinese army
 dakshin china sagar- pichley saal dakshin china sagar ko lekar vivaad kaaphi surkhiyon main rahi
 China has been asserting its historical authority over a large part of the 3
5 million square kilometers spread between China, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines
 yah vivaad antat: sanyukt raashtra kii antarrashtriya court tak pahunchaa gaya
 Hearing the plea of the Philippines here, the international tribunal struck down China, rejecting its claim to authority
 haalanki isse beparwaah china ab apane rukh par adig he or isse lekar saal 2016 main vishwa raajnneeti kaaphi garmaayi dikhi
 israel-palestine Dispute - Whenever there is a discussion on the border dispute around the world, the dispute between israel-palestine becomes abound
 saal 1948 main israel ko ek alag desh kaa darja milane se gussaayen arab deshon ke ek samooh ne is par hamalaa kar diya
 The Israeli army, however, foiled this joint offensive of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq and retained their dominance over the area
 haalanki is yuddh ke baad bhi yahaan khun kharaba aaj bhi jari he or lakhon philistiniyon ko majabuuran padosi mulkon main panaah lenaa padaa he
 belgium-netherlands Border Agreement- The border agreement between Belgium and the Netherlands between all this border disputes and the bloodshed that comes with it, becomes a hope of peace for the world
 in donon deshon ke bich mus naam kii ek nadi bahati he, jiske aasapaas ke ilaake par swaamitv donon deshon ke liye samasya kaa kaaran bana hua tha
 However, the Heads of Belgium and the Netherlands, without firing a shot, signed a land swap agreement to solve this problem, under which the Netherlands 35 acres of land is near the Netherlands, while the Dutch nation has about 7 acres of land to neighboring Belgium
 Got it
 jameenon kii is adla-badali ne khun kharaba kiye bina shanti se baatcheet ke jariye vivaadon ke hal kii ummid jagaata he

 alka lamba samarthakon kii baari bheed ke saath jama masjid ke ek number get par pahunchin, jahaan unhone saurabh bharadwaj ko bhi bulaayaa tha, lekin vah nahin aae
 Alka asked supporters whether he should resign, obviously, the supporters said no
 darasal, saurabh ne twitor par likhaa tha ki aap kab se gali-gali mohalla sabha karke puch rahi hai ki congress main janaa chaahati hum, chali jaaun kya? main bhi jarur aauungaa, samay sthaan bataa do plis! alka ne bataaya ki jabase unhone saurabh ko sthaan or samay bataaya he, tab se unka jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Alka lashed out at Saurabh Bhardwaj and said that Saurabh Bhardwaj is the party's MLA and chief spokesperson
 isliye unka bayaan party kaa stand mana janaa chahie
 Alka also said that i have been a dedicated worker of the party and i won the party in this Congress stronghold too, but the way i am being accused is not right
 unhone kaha ki party kaa puraa jor purna rajya par he, lekin congress to ab isse peeche hat gai he or party congress se gathbandhan kii koshishen kar rahi he
 i only questioned about this
 idhar party ne in donon netaaon kii ladaai ko vyaktigat maamla qaraar diya he
