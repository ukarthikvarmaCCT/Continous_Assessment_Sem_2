 Giving credit for this success, along with elders, women, youth and party workers to Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh, Vasundhara indicated that he was in a mood to run the government with mutual consent rather than colliding with the high command
 vaise bhi is safalataa ke baad haal philhal unke netritv par chunauti kii baat sochna dur kii kaudi hi sabit hoga
 On the state's bad economic condition, Vasundhara said that this is not new to me

 India and the West Indies have been face to face in big matches many times before, but the knock out semi-finals of the World T20 Championship have doubled the thrill of cricket lovers

 chote formet ke match vinurs donon tiimon main hai isliye imtihaan or kadaa he
 Let's know what will be special in this competition
 barabari par khadaa itihasabhartaur westeindies ab tak 4 baar tii20 formet main aamane-saamne hue hai or donon tiimon ne 2-2 baar jeet darj kii he
 Yes, West Indies has dominated India in the history of World T20
 is championships main donon timen 3 baar bhidi hai, jinamein se westeindies ne 2 baar jeet darj kii he, to bharat ne ek baar
 In the World T20 2016 also the journey of both teams is almost same
 bharat apana pehla match harkar baaki teen match jeeta, to westeindies kii team apane pehle teen match jitkar aakhri match afghanistan se haar gai
 Dhoni vs Sammye is right Kimhendra Singh is the best captain of Dhonihar format, but West Indies captain Darren Sammy also has a fantastic record of captaincy in T20
 dhoni ne ab tak 66 tii20 maichon main bharat kii captaini he, jinamein se 40 main unhen jeet, to 25 main haar mili he, ek match benatija rahaa he, unka jeet fisadi he 60
 Of 6 vahiin derren saimi kaa jeet fisadi bhi dhoni se jaraa hi kam 57
 7 is unhone 45 maichon main se 26 main westeindies ko jeet dilaai he or 17 main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, do match benatija rahe
 The biggest thing is that Dhoni has made India the champion of this format in 2007, while Sammy was the King of T20 to the West Indies in 2012
 haa, jahaan tak dabaav main damdaar captaini kaa sawaal he vahaan dhoni, saimi ke mukaable bees najar aate hai
 Gayle vs Viratne is going to witness a match in which two such batsmen of the bat will play in the IPL who play the same team, but in the biggest tournament of cricket's short format, they can cut each other
 
 viraat kohli aurkris gailyun to achche dost hai, lekin baat jab world tii20 ke semifinal kii ho, to haar kisi ko bhi manjuur nahin
 In this tournament, both of them have accumulated their strength
 england ke khilaaf gail kaa tufaani shatak koun bhul saktaa he
 Although Gayle has scored only 4 runs in the tournament after that, hardly anyone will doubt his ability
 vahiin viraat gail ke mukaable zyada bharosemand sabit hue hai
 His match-winning innings against Pakistan and Australia is also a sign of his being in form and a cause for fear for the West Indies
 chintaa donon khemon membharat ke liye chintaa kaa sabase bada sabab he viraat ke alaava baqiballebajonka lagaataar flop hona
 If Virat walked, then he defeated Pakistan, if Virat went, he watered Australia, but if Virat did not, then he lost to New Zealand and lost to Bangladesh
 rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan team ko acchhee shuruyaat dene main naakaam sabit ho rahe hai to suresh raina, yuvaraj singh or ravindra jadeja ke balle kii khamoshi middle order ko kamjor bana rahi he
 There is also the troubled West Indies, the over-reliance on Gayle and the absence of any batsman, except Fletcher, is increasing the problem
 tej gendbaaji westeindies kii takat he, to spin bharat kii
 Overall, there is some relief in both teams, but some want, but victory is necessary for both

 ' BCCI, the surveyor of Indian cricket, on Wednesday informed about the re-agreement with Paytm for the title rights for the 2019–23 season cycle

 8 crores was quite close to Rs
 agar Ebix kii boli ko amaanya qaraar nahin diya jaataa to BCCI ko i-ocshan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa
 Ebix is an e-commerce company
 use boli se isliye ayogy qaraar diya gaya kyonki unhen jo agency sporti solutionj boli main madad de rahi thi wo em-jankshan kii sahyogi he
 m-junction is the auction partner of BCCI
 Ebix se jab india today ne sampark karne kii koshish kii to koi pratikriya nahin mili
 But it is understood that when he bid for the rights, he was convinced that there was no conflict of interest
 BCCI ke ek adhikari ne india today ko bataaya, 'agar ritis die jane main kisi tarah kaa bhai-bhatijawad hua he to sawaal jarur uthaaya janaa chahie
 If Ebix was disqualified how passed them to Muster during the technical tender

 'samajha jaataa he ki ye mudda BCCI kii prashaskon kii cameti (COA) kii mej tak buudhvaar ko vijeta boli ke elaan se pehle tak pahunchaa tha

 But there was a majority opinion in the three-member COA that in the last stage any such step would prove to be financially harmful for the BCCI
 'boli ke vivaad ne BCCI ke i-ocshan kaa rasta nahin apanaae jane ke faisle ko bhi focus main laa diya he
 It was decided that when the financial tenders are opened, the e-auction will be required only if the bid price is at a difference of 10% from each other

 According to the report, the social welfare department continued to deposit pension money in the accounts of the dead, not only that the department was so kind to the dead people that the dead also took out the pension from the accounts and the whole department remained silent
 is tarah sarkaar kaa kareeb 5 karod rupee pani kii tarah bah gaya
 At the same time, the public exchequer lost 87 crores on presenting the wrong report
 kaig kii report ne jahaan uttarakhand sarkaar or samaaj kalyaan vibhaag kii ek badi laaparvaahee ko saamne laakar rakh diya he, to vahiin ab sarkaar ko safai dene ke alaava kuch nahin sujh rahaa, vipaksh bhi is mudde par hamalavar he
 The Social Welfare Department distributed Rs 87 crore as pension to the dead, but it was not noticed by any officer nor by the Department of Social Welfare Minister
 6 saal 6 maheene tak pension ke paise hote rahe jamaacag kii report ke anusaar, kai jagahon par mare logon ke khate main pension daali gai, wo bhi ek nahin puure 74 logon ke khate main or ek do maheene nahin, balki puure 6 saal 6 maheene tak
 Amazing thing happened when money was also withdrawn from the account of the deceased, but no one heard the news
 kaig kii report ke anusaar, 2015 se 2018 ke bich 11hajaar se zyada pension dharakon ko tay seemaa se zyada pension bhi daali gai
 Many pension holders were given dual pensions
 vahiin, unhen bhi pension di gai jo paatr hi nahin the, jabaki kai log aise rahe jinaki masik aay pehle se hi acchhee he un par bhi samaaj kalyaan vibhaag meharbaan rahaa
 The government will take action against the culprits, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawatne gave his response after the report of the CAG said that if any financial irregularities have been done intentionally, then action will be taken on them
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ve khud isko dekhenge or doshiyon par kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 At the same time, after the CAG report came, the opposition government has been attacked
 uttarakhand ke congress pradesh adhyaksh ne sarkaar par gambhir aarope lagaae or kaha ki kaig report ne sarkaar ko aaina dikhaane kaa kaam kiya he, sarkaar vittiya prabandhan main vifal sabit hui he, is sarkaar ke tamaam daavon kii pole khol di he or ham sarkaar se isliye hi lokayukta laane kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin sarkaar puri tarah se bhrashtachar main lipt he, lokayukta kii niyukti karne se sarkaar batch rahi he

 Nadal said, 'I have played the worst in 10 years of my career
 haalanki main lagaataar 10 saal tak grand slam jeet chukaa hum
 You might think that this is quite difficult to do
 mujhe yah samajhnaa hoga ki yah saal meraa nahin he lekin sizan khatm hone tak main sangharsh karata rahoonga ki sijan kaa ant achche se kar sakuun
 ' nadal ke kharaab pradarshan kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki saal 2015 main yah nadal kii 15veen haar he
 In the same year, he also dropped out of the top 10 in the ranking for the first time in his career
 nadal ne yah nahin saaf kiya ki unhen apane khel main kahaan sudhaar kii jarurat he
 However, he jokingly said that he was playing slow

 aap soch sakate hai ki yah karnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 i have to understand that this year is not mine but till the end of the season i will be struggling to finish the season well
 ' Nadal's poor performance can be gauged from the fact that this is the 15th defeat of Nadal in 2015
 isi saal ve apane kariyar main pehali baar ranking main top 10 se baahar bhi hue
 Nadal did not clarify where he needed to improve his game
 haalanki unhone majaak main kaha ki ve dhimaa khel rahe hai
 The comments 29 saal ke khilaadi ne kaha, 'main sizan ke shuruyaat main kaaphi kharaab khel rahaa tha lekin khel main ab sudhaar ho chukaa he

 maine yah baat samajhi haih bharat main log kaarobaar ko lekar kaaphi bhavuk hote hai
 
 
 People think that if someone is selling his business, he is doing this by being disappointed
 lekin main aisa nahin sochataa
 i understand that alliances, mergers, partnerships are the way forward and should not be seen as going out of business
 ''biani ne saal 2007 main jari apni pustak it hepand in india (hindi main 2008 main jari 'nae daur kii ore') main khud ko baar-baar ek baagi or bani banaai chhavi todane vaale ek shaks ke rup main pesh kiya he
 His family and colleagues also have similar opinions about him
 ve nai dishaao main tairne se kabhi nahin dare
 By the time he was just 26 years old, he had sold pants under the brand name WBB (white, Blue, Brown), sold readymade pants under trousers, started a company called Dhruv Synthetics and later discontinued it
 And started 'manz Wear', the predecessor of the modern retail brand and Pantaloon brand

 According to rough estimates, it is between 7,000 and 8,000 crore, but Biyani says "excluding nbfcs, last year we had Rs 4,800 crore
" kaa karj tha
 This year till date, we have about 5,500 to 5,700 crores
 kaa karj hoga
 After this sale (to Birla), Pantaloon retail will become debt free and only our future value retail business will remain in debt
 ''future vailu retail li

 biani ne yah bhi ghoshnaa kar rakhi he ki ve future capital holdins kii apni puri 53
 They are also looking for buyers for their insurance business Future Generali, as an initial step to exit 67 per cent stake in Future Value Retail
 ve bataate hai, ''chah maah pehle maine kaha tha ki main karj mukt ho jaaoongaa
 At that time people were not trusting me and i had to prove that i can be free from debt
 isliye yah mere liye ek abhiyaan jaisaa he
 If i can raise the business, i can also reduce my debt
 ''kya ve ek vipareet arthvyavastha se apane kile ko bachaane ke liye lamabandi kar rahe hai? saaf taur par to aisa lagata he ki ve vittiya seva kaarobaar se apane haath khinch rahe hai
 "this will help us expand our retail business," says Biyani

 Many types of options will be available

 It will take some time
 ''apni kitaab main ve likhte hai ki unka lakshya har bhartiya ke purse se ek-ek rupaya nikalava lenaa he
 Is this happening? Biyani takes a sip of tea after thinking about it and says, "I will confess with honesty that we have lost that story
" ham pehle yah sochate the ki graahak ke purse se ek-ek paisa nikalava lenaa acha hoga
 But now instead of doing everything, we are focusing only on food, fashion and home business
 ''to kya ve is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki unhone apane kaarobaar ko teji se calf bada kar liya? kya in sabakaa prabandhan mushkil ho gaya? is par unhone kaha, ''prabandhan ke lihaaj se dekhen to bahut vishaal ho jane par iskaa bahut zyada sookshm prabandhan sambhav nahin hota
 However, he laughed off criticism that he did not add sufficient numbers of outside professionals to his business, except for a few foreigners who headed the division

 "would they like to offer a lesson to newcomers entering the retail business in India?" To this he says, "stay in one area

 According to the trend, the future will be a concern for the Dabangg star

 But if we look at the trends found in the survey since February 2016, then the graph of his popularity seems to be falling down sharply

 But this decline is not as much as Salman Khan's popularity in three years

 He is the third big hero of the country in 2018 with a choice of five percent
 bataate chalem ki 2016 se lekar ab tak ke hamaare survey main unhen koi sthaan hasil nahin hua tha

 The politics of the country is hot on Rohingya Muslims
 sarkaar kaa koi saaf rukh saamne aayaa nahin he, sarkaar bhi is mudde ko lekar pashopesh main he
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi were face to face on the same issue in 'takkar', a special program of 'aaj Tak'
 vaise jab bhi tivi dibet main ye donon aamane-saamne hote hai donon ke bich jamkar jubaani jang hoti he
 At the same time, during the debate on Rohingya issue, Asaduddin Owaisi made a big statement about terrorist Hafiz Saeed
 taslima bahan to rohingya bhai kyon nahin?darasal rohingya muslimon ko lekar sarkari stand par sawaal uthaate hue ovaisi ne kaha ki agar taslima nasrin bharatiyon kii bahan hai to rohingya hamaare bhai kyon nahin ho sakate
 In response to this, Sambit Patra said that Owaisi is trying to give a religious color to the issue and that he should get a hawk
 hafiz said par ovaisi kaa bada bayaanteinin ke pramukh asaduddin ovaisi kii maane to sarkaar rohingya muslimon ke khilaaf galatabayani kar rahi he
 During the debate on 'aaj Tak', when Sambit Patra questioned the security of Hafiz Saeed, the biggest enemy of India and the leader of terrorists in Pakistan, and asked if you think he is a terrorist or not, in response to which Owaisi said That Hafiz Saeed is a terror for the world, and they ask Allah for his death
 ovaisi ne kaha, 'isamen koi shaq nahin ki hafiz said dehshatgard he, main allaah se maang karte hai use is kaam ke liye maut de
 'let the government talk about Rohingya Muslims, this week, the Central Government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, that' Rohingya Muslims are a threat to the internal security of the country and people of this community can also be associated with terrorist organizations'
 
 haalanki, court se sarkaar ne ise hold karne kii apil kii he
 Now there is a round of discussions in the political corridors about whether Rohingya Muslims are a threat to the internal security of the country or there is a political reason behind it
 supreme court kii sharan main maamlagauratlab he ki grih mantralay ke mutabik, vaid taur par 14 hajaar se zyada rohingya sharnaarthi bharat main rah rahe hai
 While there are more than 40 thousand people who have taken shelter illegally
 isi maheene pradhanmantri narendra modi ke myanmar daure par rohingya musalamaanon kaa mudda bhi uthaa tha
 At the same time, the community has approached the Supreme Court amid the government's move to expel Rohingya Muslim refugees from India
 samudaay ne court main arji dekar kaha he ki unka aatankwaad or kisi aatanki sanghathan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Amitabh Bachchan will soon be seen in 'kaun Banega Crorepati 6' (KBC) asking questions to Ajay Devgan and Sonakshi Sinha

 In the capital Delhi, bureaucrats are also beginning to get battered in front of the thieves-miscreants
 taaja maamla dilli ke posh ilaake main chori kaa he
 In the last 11 days, thieves have targeted two houses in the area
 yah donon hi ghar IAS or IRS adhikariyon ke hai
 Police is looking for the thieves after registering a case
 dilli kii posh colony panchasheel park main choron ne beete 11 dinon ke andar do gharon main chori kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 One of these houses belongs to an IAS officer, while the other house belongs to an IRS officer
 chori kii pehali vaardaat 21 agast kii he
 IRS officers were alone in the house on the night of the incident
 choron ne behad hi shaatiranaa tareeke se vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 In fact, despite being present at the officer's house, he did not have the slightest idea of being in the house of the thieves
 unhone dekha ki jis kamare main unkakimtee samanarakha tha, vah cameraa andar se band tha
 After which he suspected something untoward
 kisi tarah cameraa khulwaaya gaya to andar rakhi almaari khuli padi thi
 The precious jewelry kept in the cupboard was missing
 vahiin duusari vaardaat beete 1 sitambar kii he
 The house of the IAS officer posted as director at ONGC is also in the same colony
 vaardaat ke vakt unka driver ghar par maujuud tha
 Here, the thieves carried out the theft incident in the same manner
 darwaja andar se band tha or chor khidki se us kamare main daakhil hue the, jahaan keemtee saamaan rakhaa hua tha
 The thieves had escaped by cleaning hands on precious jewelery, watch, and cash
 police ne donon hi ghatnaon main maamla darj kar liya he
 The police suspect that both the incidents were carried out by the same gang
 police ke mutabik, ho saktaa he ki kisi jaanane vaale shaks ne hi donon vaardaaton ko anjaam diya ho, kyonki donon hi gharon main chor sirf usee kamare main daakhil hue jahaan almaari rakhi hui thi
 At present, police investigation is going on

 According to official sources, the United Nations Committee on Sanctions met here at India's request in which clarification was to be sought from Pakistan regarding Lakhvi's release in the Mumbai attack case, but representatives of China halted the move on this basis That India does not have enough information

 The proof of this is the twenty villages of Mesra area, which is just a few kilometers from Ranchi, where thousands of people living even today have to resort to boat for movement, that too without rudder
 abhi bhi naav kaa saharanav ke sahare nadi paar karne kaa najarajharkhandake kisi sudurvarti ilaake kaa nahin he, balki ye ranchi se mahaj 10 kilometre kii duuri par sthit mesra ilaake kaa he
 There are twenty-two villages in this area like Turfa, Salhan, Nava Toli, Gudli Pokhar, which are still cut off from the cities
 is ilaake se hokar bahane vaali nadi par aaj tak na to koi pul bana he or na hi koi sadak
 Because of this, people and school children here today risk their lives and depend on boats for traffic

 Children go swimming and study, and school children are made to sit in the pot and cross the river

 But for this struggle, children are worried about saving books

 We had demanded six seats under the alliance, but all these seats have been announced by the BJP on Sunday

 Modi government is going to take tough measures against smoking
 sutron ke mutabik swasthya mantralay ne jin sujhaavon ko sweekaar kiya he, unamem kuch to behad krantikari he
 The government's attitude against smoking can be gauged from the fact that the Ministry is in favor of increasing the amount of fine for smoking in public places to 20 thousand
 mantralay ke ek adhikari ne naam naa chhapane kii shart par yah jaankaree di he
 News to this effect has been published by Economic Times
 iske saath hi saarvajanik sthanon par dhumrapaan ko aparaadh kii shrenee main laayaa ja saktaa he or iske liye jurmaane kii raashi 200 se badhaakar 20 hajaar rupee kii ja sakati he
 However, according to experts, prohibiting the sale of open cigarettes will have a major impact on producers
 kyonki cigarette bikri kaa ek bada hissaa khule main bikne vaali ek yaa do stick ke rup main aata he
 The fall in sales will also affect the tax revenue of 25 thousand crores received by the cigarette industry
 aise kadamon se mushkilen bad sakati he
 According to consumer analyst Abneesh Rai, it will be interesting to see how the government implements these decisions
 kyonki lakhon paan kii dukaane or footpath par sthit bikri kendron par niyantran hasil karnaa ek badi chunauti hogi
 In the past years, governments had brought many provisions against smoking
 haalanki inhen puri tarah lagu nahin kar pain
 Significantly, the committee headed by Ramesh Chandra, former Principal Secretary, Delhi Government, submitted its report to the Ministry of Health only last week
 panel kii sifarish he ki cigarette ke packeton par tasveeron vaali chetavanee naa chhapane vaale utpaadakon par jurmaane kii raashi 5000 se badhaakar 50 hajaar kar di jaae
 At the same time, the committee has also suggested raising the age of tobacco consumption from 18 to 25, banning advertising at sales centers, increasing the size of health warning signs to about 80 percent of the packaging

 India vs Australia (IND vs AUS) 2nd ODI: bharat or australia ke bich 3 maichon kii vanade siries kaa doosraa muqabla kal yani 15 janvari se edilade ovel ke maidan par khelaa jayega
 The visiting kangaroo team defeated the star-studded Indian team by 34 runs in the first ODI match played at the Sydney Cricket Ground
 siries main australia 1-0 se aage he
 The second ODI to be played at Adelaide Oval will be a 'do or die' match for Team India
 agar bharat yah match jeet letaa he to siries main bana rahegaa nahin to australia ke haathon siries ganvaa degaa
 Except for Rohit Sharma and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, no other batsman of the team could play in Sydney ODI
 dhoni ne haalanki kaaphi dhimi pari kheli jiske liye unki aalochana bhi hui thi
 The top order of the team sat in the pavilion for just four runs, which includes the names of Shikhar Dhawan, captain Virat Kohli and Ambati Rayudu
 aisa haalanki bahut kam dekhne ko mila he jab bharat kaa top order nahin chal paaya
 In such a situation, changes can be made in the batting order and Dhoni may once again come down
 middle order par acchhee ran rate ko banaae rakhane kaa dawaab hoga jo pehle match main nahin dekhne ko mili thi
 Kohli can make changes in the team and Kedar Jadhav can be fed by sitting out Dinesh Karthik

 Posting the viral video of Kohli, the fan asked- How long will BCCI ban? The reason for Australia's victory in the first match was its bowling

 At the same time, Nathan Lyon, Marcus Stoinis held on to India's run in the middle overs, making easy-looking goals even bigger by the end
 aath saal baad vaapasi karne vaale peter sidle ne bhi prabhavi pradarshan kiya tha
 Australian bowling was good, but there was a lack of batting somewhere and due to this, the team was limited to 288 by not going beyond 300
 australian middle order ne haalanki apni jimmedaari nibhaai thi or osman khwaja, shaun marsh, peter hendscomb ne team ko kharaab shuruyaat se baahar nikaalte hue team ko sammanjanak score tak pahunchaaya tha

 rajasthan ke nagaur jile main ek vidhayak ne dabangai dikhaate hue bina toll chukaaye ek saath 50 gadiyon ko jabaran toll se nikaalane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 According to the information, on Saturday afternoon, the procession of Makrana MLA Shriram's relative was going from Makrana towards Nagaur, while the MLA himself took a stick on the Aseri toll plaza located on Jaipur Nagaur highway to remove all the trains without paying toll
 pointed to
 is baat par toll karmiyon ne vidhayak se toll chukaane kii baat kahi to vidhayak mahoday ne jhagada karne va marpet karne tak kii dhamkee dete hue, jabaran ek-ek gaadi ko toll plaza se nikalvaaya
 Several times the toll workers came in front of the vehicles and asked to pay the toll, but the MLA did not listen to one of the toll workers
 watsape paravidhayak jeeki karstani kaa video viral ho chukaa he
 In the video, Makrana MLA Shriramtol is seen pushing the worker away
 vidhayak dwaara tolkarmi ko baar-baar dekh lene or marpet karne kii dhamkee dete hue bhi video main saaf sunai de rahaa he
 This whole scene was quietly captured by a toll worker in his mobile
 iske baad yah maamla media main pahunchaa to is ghatana kavideo viralho gaya
 After which MLA Shriram, refusing to speak anything to the media, brushed off the matter and said that it happens often at every toll, there is nothing new in this
 philhal is maamle kii likhit shikaayat kisi bhi thane main darj nahin hui he jabaki toll karmiyon dwaara ghatana kii jaankaree badi khatu thane main de di gai thi
 It will be seen now that this toll plaza belongs to Bhanwar Singh Palada, the husband of the ruling MLA and the MLA from the ruling party left without threatening the toll workers

 Australia's art of playing shots on bouncing wickets was well-known by batsmen like Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar

 unhone kaha ki pulavama hamale ke bare main apana bayaan dene se pehle vah sena ke nirdesh kaa hi intjaar kar rahe the
 Reham Khan alleged that Imran came to power by compromising his principles
 reham khan ne kaha, 'imran khan vichaardhaara or udaar nitiyon se samjhauta kar satta main aae hai
 i cannot think for one minute that this is his policy
 unhen aisa karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya he or satta-pratishthan jo chahta he vaisaa karne ke liye unhen nirdesh detaa he
 We have seen the emergence of many new extremist religious parties during the elections and we have seen a lot of violence, riots in Islamabad as well
 imran khan ishaninda card kaa bhi istemaal kar rahe hai
 Rehm's statement came after the Pakistan PM Imran Khan's response to the Pulwama attack on Tuesday
 imran khan ne kaha ki bharat yadi jang kaa elaan karata he to pakistan nishchit rup se iskaa jawaab degaa
 He also claimed that he is ready to take strict action if evidence of the involvement of the people of Pakistan in Pulwama attack is found
 imran khan ne tivi par prasaarit apane bayaan main kaha, 'aap yadi yah sochate hai ki aap hamaare khilaaf jang ched denge to aap galat hai
 We will answer it, we have no choice but to answer it
 jang shuru karnaa to insaan ke haath main he, lekin iskaa ant kya hoga allaah hi jaanata he
 Reham Khan said, 'they are doing what Emraan Khan has been taught
 vah yadi yah daawa kar rahe hai ki logon par karrwai karenge to kuch karke dikhaanaa hoga
 Our country is on the way to being blacklisted in the Financial Action Task Force and this is even before Pulwama
 'reham ne kaha, 'hamen karrwai kerani chahie, isliye nahin ki bhartiya pradhanmantri yah chaahate hai, balki isliye kyonki yah pakistan ke hit main he
 Imran Khan is saying the right thing, but we have not seen him taking any step in the last seven-months
 yah ho saktaa he ki hamaara (pakistan sarkaar) jaish ke saath koi judaav na ho, lekin hamane in sanghathanon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii he
 Reham Khan said, 'I think some think tank may have worked on his speech
 mujhe nahin lagata ki yah unka bhaashan he
 i think they have been asked to speak it all
 'gauratlab he ki pichley hafte guuruuvaar ko jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main surakshabalon ke kafile par hue aatanki hamale main 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the

 maujuuda champion germany kii team rus main jari fifa vishwa cap-2018 se baahar ho gai
 Germany lost 0–0 to South Korea in their final group match on Wednesday
 iske saath hi vah 80 saal main pehali baar world cap ke pehle hi daur main baahar ho gai
 Statistics show that the last time the German team was discharged in the first round of the FIFA World Cup on 9 June 1938
 yani 80 saal 18 din baad ek baar phir germany ne 'sabase bura' din dekha
 German coach Joaquim's bad condition: Like the 1934 World Cup, the 1938 World Cup was played in the knockout format
 or is world kaa pehla daur 'round of-16' kaa tha
 Germany did not reach the next stage (the last eight) after losing 2–4 to Switzerland in that World Cup played in France
 yah match dobaaraa is liye khelaa gaya, kyonki 4 june 1938 ko extra time ke baad bhi germany-switzraland kaa match 1-1 se baraabar rahete hue benatija rahaa tha
 FIFA FACT - Talking about the group stage, Germany's team failed to cross the World Cup group stage hurdle for the first time
 gauratlab he ki 1930 main khelaa gaya pehla world cap group charan ke formet main khelaa gaya tha
 Germany was not included in this World Cup
 iske baad 1934 or 1938 ke world cap main nokout formet ko apanaaya gaya
 In 1950, the group stage format was again implemented, although Germany was banned from that World Cup (1950)
 germany kii team 1954 se lagaataar world cap khel rahi he
 And in 2018 she did not succeed in crossing the group stage

 rahtakarmiyon ne bataaya ki haalanki nauka par savaar do anya log tairkar bachane main safal rahe
 Significantly, many areas of Pakistan are in the grip of floods these days

 aisa bahut kam hota he jab katl ke kisi maamle main kaatil ke pakade jane ke baavjood katl kii kahani naa sulajhe
 Do not remove layers of plot
 lekin mumbai main hue artist hema upaadhyaay or unke vakil harish bhambani ke dabl murder kii kahani ke saath kuch aisi hi ho rahaa he
 Despite the arrest of four people so far in connection with this double murder, neither the real story of Murder has come out nor has her husband got a clean chit in the divorce dispute with Hema
 rahasyamayi tareeke se hue gayabshahar se achaanak do log rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab ho jate hai
 But the plot is not known
 24 ghante ke bheetar donon kaa katl ho jaataa he
 But the plot is not known
 agle 24 ghante main is katl ke iljaam main chaar log pakade jate hai
 All three confess their crime
 lekin phir bhi sajeesh kaa pataa nahin chalata
 Such cases are rarely seen in the world of crime
 jahaan gunahagaar ke pakade jane ke baavjood vaardaat kii sajeesh poshida rah jaae
 But the story of Mumbai's high profile double murder case is similar
 aise hui kahani kii shuruyaat12 disambar shanivaar ko shaam 6
 The bodies of Hema and Harish were found in a drain in Kandivali at 30 am
 donon kii laash gatte ke dibbon main pack thi or dekh kar lag rahaa tha ki donon kaa katl galaa ghont kar kiya gaya he
 The police soon identified the duo and also started investigating due to missing reports lodged in two different police stations of the city
 jaanch aage badi to pataa chalaa ki contemparari artist hema upaadhyaay kaa apane pati chintan upaadhyaay ke saath talaak kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he or is ladaai main vakil harish bhambani unka saath de rahe hai
 So, the initial suspicion went on contemplation and soon the contemplation was taken into custody
 lekin maamla tab pehali baar ulajhata hua laga, jab pakade jane ke baavjood chintan aisi kisi sajeesh se lagaataar inkaar karata rahaa
 But in the meantime, the police came to know of one such thing, which changed the entire extent of his investigation
 ye baat thi katl se chand ghante pehle hema upaadhyaay ke mobile par aayaa ek telephone kol
 Upon investigation, it was discovered that the man who telephoned Hema had asked her to give evidence against her husband Chintan and that is why Hema left to meet her with her lawyer
 lekin iske baad na jane aisa kya hua ki donon kaa ghar lautnaa to dur, donon kaa katl kar laashen kandivali ke naale main nipta di gayi
 The police pursuing this anonymous telephone call in search of the murderer in the investigation, soon reached Varanasi, from where he arrested a person named Shiv Kumar alias Sadhu Rajbhar
 ye shaks naa sirf donon katl kii baat kubul kar rahaa tha, balki is sajeesh main shaamil duusare logon kaa naam bhi bataa rahaa tha
 Three more people were also arrested from Mumbai
 lekin kamaal dekhie ki police ko mili is kamyaabi ko bhi ab teen se chaar din guzar gaye, magar mumbai kii is hai profile dabl murder mistry kii sajeesh ab puri tarah saaf nahin ho saki
 The question is, why? Because the story ahead is even more strange and confusing
 telephone kol ke ird-gird kahanemumbai ke is hai profile dabl murder cese kii puri kahani pehle hi din se ek rahasyamayi telephone kol ke ird-gird gum rahi thi kyonki yahi wo telephone kol thi, jiske aane ke baad hema upaadhyaay kandivali main kisi se milane ke liye apane ghar se nikal gai thi or unka katl ho gaya tha
 And for this reason, the police reached Varanasi after chasing the mysterious call telephone number
 kyonki ye phone mumbai main rah kar photo freming kaa workshop chalaanevaale vidyadhar rajbhar naam ke ek aise shaks ne kiya tha, jo mul rup se varanasi kaa rahanevaala tha
 And as soon as Hema and Harish's corpse was found, Vidyadhar escaped from Mumbai in a panic with one of his friends and a sadhu Rajbhar who accompanied him to the murder
 udhar, jab police ko ye pataa chalaa ki vidyadhar apane mulajim sadhu ke saath varanasi ke liye nikal chukaa he, to mumbai police bhi varanasi ke liye chali
 But after chasing Vidyadhar and Sadhu Rajbhar, Mumbai Police got a big shock when it came to know that Vidyadhar did not reach Varanasi with Sadhu but he got in the middle of the way by saying that he came back in front of Mumbai Police
 Going to surrender ye baat thi mumbai or varanasi ke bich maujuud itarasi railway stesan kii
 But Vidyadhar not only escaped from this itarsi, but he also switched off his mobile phone
 haalanki varanasi main pehle upi estf or phir mumbai police ke hathe chadhane vaale sadhu rajbhar ne jo khulaasa kiya, wo chaunkaanewaala tha
 He told the police that Hema Upadhyay and Vidyadhar were business partners
 or isi partnership ke bakaae ke taur par vidyadhar hema se 5 lakh 20 hajaar rupye lenaa chahta tha
 While Hema was not giving this money
 11 sitambar ko vidyadhar ne hema ko phone kiya or use uske pati chintan ke khilaaf subut dene ke badale phir se apane rupayon kii maang kii
 This time Hema agreed to pay the money due to the greed of evidence, but at the same time laid down this condition and first he and his lawyer Harish Bhabani would investigate the evidence themselves
 vidyadhar iske liye raji ho gaya or donon kandivali main vidyadhar rajbhar ke godaam main ja pahunche
 Chantalekin but hit Hema a new twist comes in the story
 vidyadhar or hema main rupayon ke liye bahes hone lagi or gusse main vidyadhar ne hema ko chaanta raseed kar diya
 Now Hema's attitude also changed and she also slapped Vidyadhar
 or bas yaheen gusse ke maahaul main dohare katl kii jameen taiyaar ho gai
 Vidyadhar gestured to his two men, including the monk, and the three sniffed Hema earlier by smelling the chloroform kept in the warehouse and causing Harish Bhabani to be the eye witness
 or phir ek-ek kar donon kaa galaa ghont kar katl kar diya gaya
 But is the story of this double murder so complete? Or is there really something else? Because Hema's husband Chintan is also not out of doubt

 gahanon ko mahilaon kaa pehla pyaar kaha jaataa he
 There is hardly any woman who does not love jewelry
 par gahanon ke rakh-rakhaav kaa sahi tarika pataa hona bhi behad jaruri he
 Buying jewelry is an expensive hobby, so it is very important to save them properly
 aap chahen to in upayon ko apana sakate hai
 These are very simple measures that will keep your jewelry nice and new for a long time
 1
 We wear expensive jewelery on any special occasion
 aise main jaise hi party khatm ho or aap ghar lauten turant un gahanon ko utarkar kisi surakshit jagah par rakh den
 This also leaves them not afraid of losing and there is no fear of breaking down
 2
 Many times it happens that we do not keep ornaments in any hurry, according to their original shape
 par gahanon ko unki shape ke aadhaar par hi rakhana chahie
 Like necklace, it would be better to keep it in the box given by the jeweler instead of folding it
 3
 It is better to keep stone jewelry in small silk pouches
 aisa karne se stone surakshit rahete hai
 4
 box main jewelery rakhane se pehle use saaf kar len
 Wipe the jewelry with cotton with light hands
 aisa karne se us par lage dhul ke kan saaf ho jaaenge
 5
 samay-samay par jewelery ko dekhte-jaanchate rahen
 If any screw or any link has become weak, then go to the jeweler to get it fixed
 aisa karnaa surakshit rahegaa

 It is being said that Isha also has a strong role in the film
 periods
 
 
 a word on which men, even women, hesitate to speak
 yah shabd sunate hi sabhi asahaj hone lagate hai
 Even women themselves cannot talk openly about their physical processes
 ab pregnent hone ke liye har maheene period hona jaruri nahin!mahilaon main isaki shuruyaat amuman 12 saal kii umr main ho jaati he
 With this, the girl becomes a woman, but from there, a series of embarrassment starts every month in her life
 
 
 
 So because of this, it is forbidden for girls to enter the kitchen of their houses during periods during menstruation in those painful days of the month and it is considered a sin to step into the temple
 kai jagah ladakiyon ko bed par sone kii bhi ijaajat nahin hoti
 They are put to sleep on different grounds
 migraine se peedit mahilaon ko un dinon main hoti he zyada takalifbadalte daur main mahilaon kii is sthiti ke bare main bhartiya samaaj ke purush kya sochate hai, yah jaananaa bhi jaruri he
 The India Today Group's Audnari website asked the men their opinions about the periods when some shocking answers emerged
 periods kya he-is bare main baat karte samay kuch purush hichkichaate najar aae
 One even went as far as to say that he did not know about it
 bas wo ye jaanate hai ki us samay pani nikalataa he
 One gentleman said that one is exclusively in women, which starts at the age of 16–17
 isse andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki purush is vishay main kitne jaagruk hai
 What is the problem for women during periods - On this, the men of our society are of the opinion that during periods, women become a little weak and have a mild smell
 mahilaon ke kapade par khun kaa daag dekh aap kya karenge-agar bhartiya purush kisi mahila ke kapadon par khun kaa daag dekhenge to wo duusari ladki ko bolenge ki us ladki ko bataa do ki tumhaare kapadon par daag laga he
 Why men cannot tell women the reason for heart attack if the pain of periods does not happen: In response to this question, men said that they themselves cannot tell women about the stains on clothes
 unke mutabik to yah baat chupaane vaali hoti he
 Should women be prevented from going to the temple: On this question, one expressed her opinion and said that the girls themselves have told me that she does not feel clean at this time so she does not like to go to the temple
 vahiin ek duusare purush kaa jawaab sunakar aisa laga ki hamaara desh sach main badal rahaa he
 The man said that if women can get permission to fast for their husbands then they should also get permission to visit the temple
 auraton ko mandir jane kii anumati kyon nahin hoti he-zyaadaatar purush yahi maanate hai ki is samay mahilaayein achhut hoti hai or unhen mandir jaise pavitra sthal par nahin janaa chahie
 You will not know these things related to periods whether the blood of periods is bad - most men consider periods blood to be dirty
 unka maananaa he ki us samay badboo bhi aati he or sharir main gandagi hoti he isliye to khun nikalataa he
 Do men understand that a woman has just had periods - men believe that women are not able to function well during periods and by looking at them it is understood that they have had periods

 vahaan ke raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena ne ranil vikramsinghe ko hataakar purv raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe ko nayaa pradhanmantri bana diya he
 Rajapaksa is the one whom the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena defeated in the last presidential elections
 vikramsinghe kii suraksha bhi waapas le lee gai he
 However, Ranil Wickramasinghe says that he is still constitutionally the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka
 unka daawa he ki 225 sadasyeey sadan main unke paas ab bhi bahumat he
 Political analysts say Sirisena's move to make Rajapaksa the prime minister could create a constitutional crisis, as the 19th amendment to the constitution would not allow Wickremesinghe to be removed as prime minister without a majority
 srilanka kii sansad main rajpakshe va sirisena kii kul 95 siten hai or bahumat se peeche hai
 At the same time, Wickremesinghe's UNP has 106 seats of its own and only seven short of the majority
 isse pehle yuanpi ne kaha ki raashtrapati ke paspradhanmantri ranil vickremasingheko hataane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Apart from this, Mangala Samaraweera of United National Party (UNP), who was a minister in the coalition government, termed the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as unconstitutional
 unhone twit kiya, 'rajpaksheki pradhanmantri ke rup main niyukti asanvaidhanik or gaiyrkanoonee he
 This is an anti-democracy coup
 ' bataa den ki saal 2015 ke chunaav main maitreepala ne ranil vikramsinghe kii UNP ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai thi
 At the same time, due to political upheaval in Sri Lanka, Sirisena suspended the parliament till 16 November, as Wickremesinghe had called for an emergency session to prove his majority
 saath hi raashtrapati ne vikramsinghe kii nijee suraksha or vaahanon ko unke 72 varshiya uttaradhikari mahinda rajpakshe ko saunpane ke liye waapas liya

 police ke mutabik purushottam ne kinhin malik, yadav or gurusvaami kaa naam liya
 Purushottam said that Guruswamy had given a betel nut of 2 crore for the murder of Bharadwaj

 But till today Swami Anand Maharaj rejected these things completely
 anand maharaj daawa kar rahe hai ki gurusvaami unka naam he hi nahin
 His argument is that any saint and saint can be called a guru and a master
 aaj tak par anand maharaj ne deepak bharadwaj se apane sambandhon ke bare main bataaya or kaha ki deepak unka bahut sammaan karte the
 But Deepak never made any mention of family disputes

 Police also said that there may be three to four more people in the case, which are yet to be identified
 abhi tak wo simcard bhi nahin baraamad hua he jiskaa istemaal hatyaron ne kiya tha

 is sabamein ek cheez to pukhta he
 We have now come to know of the person from Chennai who is p
 chidambaram se sabase zyada nafrat karata he
 His name is R
 kumarmurugan
 On 16 September, the 66th birthday of the Home Minister, he filled Chennai with big posters of Chidambaram
 inamen unhen aadhunik krishna ke rup main dikhaaya gaya tha
 "senior member of Tamil Nadu Congress" Kumaramurugan does not believe in metaphors
 ve sidhi baat karne vaale shaks hai
 In the picture of Krishna created by him, all the elements of Krishna in the calendar are present
 masalan ek gumbadakaar mukut, kangan, ba'bandha, galmala or lipistic
 But instead of the face of God, Chidambaram's face has been fitted
 itihaas ke ye pehle krishna hai, jo chashma dhaaran kiye hue hai
 Kumaramurugan is not merely a believer in claims
 chidambaram ke 66 kii umr main hi ishwartv ko praapt ho jane ke unhone teen kaaran bataae hai
 i quote them: "you gave a loan for education
 
 
 aap hi hai jo desh ko aatankwaadi hamalon se bachaa sakate hai
 
 
 We have our God
 '' baat shishe kii tarah saaf he
 Any person who can afford a loan to go to school and protect us from terrorism (unless you have been in the Delhi High Court campus that week) is miles ahead of others on the path of divinity
 kumarmurugan ne congress ke duusare devataaon ko bhi yathochit sthaan diya he
 Pictures of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were also there, but they appeared like a small postage stamp on this big grand envelope
 dilli main to kisi bhi poster yaa vigyaapan main gandhi parivaar ke logon ko sabase zyada ahmiyat di jaati he
 But now we have come to know about Chennai, who keeps a lot of influence there
 jaahir-si baat he ki kumarmurugan chidambaram par tanj kas rahe hai or unako tabah kar dena chaahate hai
 They will make such a poster of them in love and reverence, is it possible? Chidambaram cannot be blamed for the mistakes and sins of his spouses
 par tamilnadu kii ajeebogareeb kism kii raajnneeti netaaon ke prashansakon-anuyaayiyon ko atyant unmaadi pratikriya ke liye uksaati he
 They do not necessarily donate to the temple built by Krishna next time too
 par sharmindagi unki samasya nahin he
 They shamelessly stake their claim on the poster and expect a position in the party or at least want to publicly show proximity to their personal deity
 par is tarah ke kumarmurugan yah nahin samaj pate ki loktantr or iske vikalp taanaashaahee yani do sthitiyon main panpane vaali pichhalggu samskruti ke bich fark kya he
 The dictatorship of the rulers in the dictatorship may distract them from the truth and make the leaders autocratic
