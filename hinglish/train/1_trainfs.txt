 There is a tremendous buzz in the action entertainer film of Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan coming in the last week of the year
 simba complit antertenment package he, jisamen romance, dance, ection, drama or thriller hoga
 Some people are comparing Simba with Rohit Shetty's Singham

 In a conversation with Firstpost English, Rohit Shetty said, "this Telugu film is based on the taper
" kuch hi plot aise hai jo ek jaise najar aaenge
 This is a completely new story
 jab ham singhm ko pramot kar rahe the, tab logon kaa kahana tha ki ye dabang kii tarah lag rahi he
 "" If any other vehicle bounces in the air, people say that it is Rohit Shetty's cinema
 koi doosraa actor police kaa role karata he to log kehete hai ye film singhm kii tarah lag rahi he
 Until people see Simba, they won't know about the film
 ''singhm or simba main bada fark''agarsimbadekhakar logon ke jahan main singhm aa rahi he to ye acchhee baat he
 Because they are from the same Universe

 That while Singham was an honest police officer, Simba is corrupt
 singhmka matlab sher he or simba kaa matlab sher kaa baccha
 So we named the movie Simba

 hai court ne ye aadesh ek yachika kii sunwaayee main diya he
 Apart from this, the national anthem must be played once in a month in all government offices, private companies as well
 viramani naam ke ek chaatr ne rajya sarkaar kii naukari ke liye pariksha di thi jisamen wo ek number se fail ho gaya
 The reason for the failure was that the Vande Mataram song was written in which language to answer the wrong answer
 kya likhaa tha jawaab?viramani ne apane uttar main bataaya tha ki vande maataram geet bengali bhashaa main likhi gai thi, jabaki board kii taraf se uskaa sahi uttar sanskrit bataaya gaya
 Regarding this, Veeramani filed a petition in the Madras High Court urging to clear the situation on the language of Vande Mataram
 13 june ko rajya sarkaar ke vakil ne court main bataaya ki raashtragit vande maataram mul taur par sanskrit bhashaa main tha lekin use bengali bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha
 After this, the Madras High Court pronounced the decision to make Vande Mataram compulsory for all schools, colleges and educational institutions
 court ne kya diya aadesh?- court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki sabhi skool, college, uniwarsity main saptaah main ek baar vande maataram jarur bajnaa chahie
 - All the government offices, private companies should also play the national anthem once a month
 - rajya ke soochna vibhaag ko vande maataram ko sabhi bhashaa main aplod karnaa chahie, unhen ye soshal media par bhi daalana chahie
 - a copy of this order will also be sent to the Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu
 - agar kisi vyakti ko vande maataram gane main koi takalif ho rahi he, to use jabaran gane ko majaboor nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It is to be noted that earlier the Supreme Court had also made it mandatory to play the first national anthem of every film in the cinema hall, the court said that all have to stand in honor of the national anthem

 i was silent, because the more mud you throw, the more the lotus will blossom
 'modi ne kaha ki chidambaram itane ahamkaari hai ki ve sochate hai ki vahi samast gyaan ke bhandar hai

 After the Yogi government of UP decided to withdraw the rape case lodged against Swami Chinmayananda, former Union Minister of State for Home, the victim of the case wrote a letter to the President, Chief Justice, Governor and Chief Minister sensationally accusing them of not taking action in this regard
 
 peedita kaa aarope he ki upi sarkaar aaropee swami kaa khulkar madad kar rahi he
 The victim Sadhvi alleges that former minister of state for home Chinmayananda, accused of sexual harassment, is an influential leader
 isliye unako shashan, prashasan or nyaayalay se khuli madad mil rahi he
 This is the reason that instead of taking action against them, they are being helped
 ab to upi sarkaar inke khilaaf darj rape cese ko waapas lene kaa faisla kar chuki he
 Sadhvi wrote in the letter, 'I lodged a case against Chinmayananda, the head of Mumukshu Ashram at Shahjahanpur Kotwali on 30 November 2011
 us samay tak vah aaropee kii shishyaa or ashram kii prabandhak thi
 She was raped for a long time after being seduced, lured and held hostage in the name of retirement

 'the investigation of this case was given to the Inspector of Kotwali, but the police did not show any special interest in the investigation with the intention of benefiting the accused

 After this, the deliberations of this case were hanging like this

 On this, DIG Antony Dev Kumar handed over the investigation to Badaun police
 badaayun kii tatkaaleen esaspi manzil saini ne esas ko vivechna saunp di
 The victim alleges that her case revolved between the police and the court, but she did not get justice from anywhere
 isi bich upi main bijepi sarkaar banane ke baad aaropee chinmayanand kaa manobal or adhik bad gaya he
 The accused is spreading rumors about himself that he is Gurubhai of Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi, while there is no truth in it
 is afvaah ke chalate iees or ipies aaropee ko dandavat pranaam karne lage hai
 Due to this, the accused has withdrawn his case from the High Court
 yah mukadmaa waapas le lene se jila nyaayalay se jari warrant sakriy ho gaya he
 But the accused is hopeful that the police-administration cannot do anything at this time
 aaropee yogi se kai baar mil chukaa he
 Sadhvi has pleaded through the letter that the government has decided to take back the case against the accused, while the government should not have the right to withdraw the case
 isliye is cese ko upi se baahar sthanantarit kar dena chahie, taaki praarthini ko nyaay mil sake
 The accused can also get him attacked on the basis of his influence

 bharat ke purv captain rahul dravid aisa koi bandobast chaahate hai jisamen duniya ke sarvshereshth cricketer test cricket main apane desh ke liye khilne ke saath indian premier lig bhi khel saken
 Dravid, who was the captain of Rajasthan Royals in the last IPL, said that i do not know the solution but i want the best cricketers in the world to play both IPL and Test cricket
 unhone kaha ki kris gail or kevin petersan jaise khilaadi behtareen test or tii-20 cricketer hai
 They should get full opportunities to show their talent
 dravid ne kaha ki aakhirkaar yah khel darshakon ke liye hi he
 Play the best players for your country
 yah sirf maidan main aane vaale darshakon kii nahin balki test cricket pasand karne vaale yuvaaon ke liye bhi he
 It is very disappointing if the best cricketer does not play for the country
 unhone kaha ki iske liye ek formula banaaya janaa chaiye
 During the third Test on Lord's between England and South Africa, bbc's Test Match Special quoted Dravid as saying that it is true that the IPL is important and people want to watch it
 unhone kaha ki ek aisa samay aayegaa jab ‘give and tech’ jaruri hoga
 Either a window has to be made for the IPL or the tournament will have to be shortened
 dravid ne kaha ki iskaa samaadhaan jaruri he kyonki ipel kii tareekhen england ke cricket satr kii shuruuaat ke saath takaraati rahengi or petersan tathaa kris gail jaise bade naamon kaa baahar hona test cricket ke paksh main nahin he
 Dravid, who was in London to attend the MCC Cricket Committee meeting, said there are some positive things associated with the IPL and you have to understand that if the top players from all over the world want to play in it and people want to watch it then Something good will happen
 unhone kaha ki isse vishesh taur par england kaa satr prabhavit hoga kyonki england kaa satr paaramparik taur par pichley kai varshon se ek hi samay shuru hota he
 So it is a bit challenging
 samay aane par ham aise charan main pahunch jaaenge jahaan sabhi chahenge ki sarvshereshth khilaadi (test cricket) khelen
 Dravid said that we all want Chris Gayle to play on his behalf whenever the West Indies play a Test match
 ham main se koi bhi aisi sthiti kaa saamana nahin karnaa chahta jisase kevin petersan jaisaa diggaj khilaadi team se baahar ho, phir kaaran chaahe jo bhi ho or kaarnon par baat nahin karnaa chahta lekin yah niraashajanak he
 When the top players do not play Test cricket, it only hurts the game

 akhbaar ne sampadakeey main pakistan main aatanki samoohon par sakht karrwai karne par jor dete hue kaha ki aisa karne se islamabad ko antarrashtriya samudaay kaa aadar-sammaan dobaaraa praapt hoga

 akhbaar kesampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘
 
 
 But it is hoped that this view is over now because Prime Minister Imran Khan has promised that no group will be allowed to use Pakistan's land for terrorist activities
 unako apane vaade par khara utarana chahie
 This is the only way through which Pakistan can gain the respect of the international community and in the same way can counter India's propaganda to isolate Pakistan
 ''don ne sampadakeey main kaha he, ‘‘zyaadaatar aatanki samoohon par pratibandh lagaaya ja chukaa he lekin yah sunishchit kiye jane kii jarurat he ki ye sabhi phir se punerjeevit na ho paaen

 With the war of Kargil taking place only two months after the visit, the world saw Vajpayee as the peacemaker and Pakistan as the invader, a defining moment of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure in February 1999 on his Lahore bus tour
 yah aisa faisla tha jo hindustan or pakistan ke rishton main amulchul badlaav laane kii sambhaavna se vabsta tha
 There was also the cleverness to understand it in the insane Siyasatdaan Vajpayee and the bravery to persuade those who saw evil in everything

 As Vajpayee Beach was planning to travel to Amritsar in February, it was suggested that he might flag off the bus from Amritsar
 avibhajit punjab main in donon shaharon ko aksar judawaan shahar kaha hi jaataa tha or donon ke bich 40 kilometre kaa faasla tha, par 1947 main ye kadikhaan tut gai thim
 As a symbol, flagging the bus from Amritsar would have been equivalent to opening the wagah-attari doors and it would have been more symbolic than inaugurating it from Delhi

 Not only this, Adityanath said that pigs also produce a lot of children here and Azam Khan may have got the inspiration to have a child from there itself
 ajam ko bachche paidaa karne ke liye pakistan chale janaa chahie
 Actually, Adityanath made this statement in Bijnor after Aajam Khanke's statement on Modi
 adityanath ne kaha, 'ajam khan ek aisa kaua he jo jis ped par baithta he use sukha detaa he or vah samaajawaadee party ko bhi sukha degaa

 The BJP government and the church of Madhya Pradesh are on a collision course for the second time in 17 months
 pichhali baar donon ke bich shiksha ke adhikaar (artii) par amal ko lekar rassakashi hui thi
 The Christian community had moved to the High Court against the imposition of RTE in unaided minority schools, where the government had to suffer
 adaalat ne artii par amal ke march 2013 ke aadesh ko gaiyr-sahaayta praapt alpsankhyak skulon ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan bataate hue nazaij tehraaya tha
 This time the battle can also move forward
 is jhagade kii jad madhya pradesh rajya alpsankhyak ayog (empsaimasi) kii sarkaar se yah sifarish he ki isai dharmik parisampattiyon kii dekharekh ke liye vakf board kii tarj par madhya pradesh isai board banaaya jaae
 At the August 5 meeting of the commission, four members, led by one member Anand Bernard, had given their approval for the proposal to set up Madhya Pradesh Christian Board
 alpsankhyak ayog or khaas taur se barnard kareeb chah saal se isai board banane ke paksh main daleelein de rahe hai
 Bernard is a Protestant and claims that this attempt has provoked Catholic Christians and is planning to knock on the High Court
 barnard isai parisampattiyon kii raksha ke liye board ke gathan ko fori jarurat bataate hai kyonki jabalpur sahit kai jagah kabristaan beche ja rahe hai
 According to him, one day it may come that the Protestant community will not have any property in the state
 ve aarope lagaate hai ki kuch padariyon kii mileebhagat se bhu-mafia rajyabar main isaayiyon kii kai jaaydaad bech chukaa he
 He says, "I want to save the land of my community no matter what the cost is
" mere samudaay ke anek log board ke gathan ke pakshdhar hai to samudaay ke hi kuch log jameen bech rahe hai
 "but the President of the State Christian Association and former member of the MPSMC, Indira Iyengar, says that the Minorities Commission should have consulted the Christian priests before recommending to form a Christian Board
 ve kahati hai, ''prastaavit board se isaayiyon kaa bhala nahin hone ja rahaa he, balki yah isaayiyon kii jameen hadapney kaa hi kaam karegaa
 The government should leave Christians alone
 vah samudaay kaa bhala nahin kar sakati
 Both Protestants and Catholics are against the board
 agar sarkaar board banane kii disha main badhati he to ham adaalat jaaenge
 The sale of many properties of the Hawabagh Methodist Church in Jabalpur (in the wake of controversies) was actually the Indian Church law of 1927 before independence
 lekin bharat ke ganatantr banane ke baad aisa koi kanoon astitv main nahin rah gaya
 Bernard says efforts are also being made to manage Christian properties in Kerala
 unke mutabik, isai sampatti kuch padariyon or unke parivaar kii jaagir ban gai hai jo dhokhe se use bech rahe hai
 He claims, "only priests run in property related to religion and community
" main chahta hum ki saamudayik jaaydaad ke maamle main saamaanya isai ko bhi bolne kaa haq ho
 Many Christians ask me to save community property
 ''ve kehete hai, ''mujhe catholic padariyon ke sanghathan ne samaaj se bahishkrut kar rakhaa he
 i know that making rules for church properties is a revolutionary step and i am willing to bear every consequence for it
 isa messiah ko bhi purohiton kaa virodh karne ke liye suuli par chadhaaya gaya tha
 Even Jesus had to use force to free the Synagogue from commercial activities
 '' vaise barnard kaa sawaal lajimi he
 According to him, "the Wakf Board oversees the religious property of Muslims and under it a tribunal deals with every dispute, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee handles the affairs of the Sikh community, the Parsi Anjuman manages the community assets of the Parsi community and If the affairs of Hindus are decided by the Hindu temple law, why should the Christian Board take care of the community assets of Christians? Can not be made? "to this, the Catholic Diocese Arch Bishop Leo Leo Cornelio's answer in Bhopal is," We did not inherit the land, we bought it
 hamaari sampattiyon ke prabandhan kii pukhta vyavastha he
 We do not need a Christian board to manage them
 ham jameen-jaaydaad kaa istemaal munafa yaa paisa kamaane ke liye nahin karte, balki dharmarth karte hai
 Our aim is to help the poor, serve the needy and educate them
 agar koi hamaare adhikaron par ankush lagane kii koshish karata he to ham kanoonee madad lenge
 "however, he also says," i have no objection if the board is made on the lines of the Waqf Board for the management of Christian cemeteries
 '' jabalpur ke carch of north india ke diosij bishap pi

 singh bhi sampatti prabandhan kii vartmaan vyavastha se santusht hai
 However, in 2007, as a member of MPSMC, Bernard said he had started working to make arrangements for the management of church properties that Catholics reached the High Court against MPSMC with the plea that they make rules for church properties
 Are against yahaan unki yachika khaarij ho gai
 He then went to the Supreme Court but later withdrew the petition
 board ke gathan ke peeche rajnatik manshaa kii ashanka jaahir karte hue pradesh bishap conference ke pravaktaa johny pi

 empsaimasi kii sifarish ko durbhagyapurna bataate hai
 "bernard might have made such a recommendation to please the government," he says
 '' johny kehete hai, ''ham apni sampattiyon kaa prabandhan vyavasthit or sangathit tareeke se karte hai
 We have not got any property from the British for free
 hamaari panjikrut dharmarth sansthaaon ne ye sampattiyaan kharidi hai isliye uskaa prabandhan koi or kare, iskaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 We do not want any institution on the lines of the Waqf Board
 agar aisi sthiti ai to ham adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataayenge
 Anand Muttungal, convener of the National Christian Federation, a Christian society organization, is also questioning Bernard's intentions
 unke mutabik, barnard tabhi yah mudda uthaate hai jab empsaimasi main unki sadsyta kii teen saal kii avadhi khatm hone ko hoti he
 He says, "this time too his term is ending in August
" ve vivaad chhedakar ek or kaarykaal hasil karne kii firaaq main hai
 He wants to please the Hindu fundamentalists to get a third term
 '' muttungal ke mutabik, unhone teen saal pehle supreme court main daayar yachika sarkaar ke vidhansabha main is aashwaasan ke baad waapas lee thi ki isai board gathan kii pahal nahin hogi

 dilli vidhansabha kaa do divasiy kaa satr shuru ho chukaa he haalanki satr kii ghoshnaa ek saptaah pehle hi kar di gai thi
 The first day of the session passed on accusations against each other
 satr ke pehle din jaise hi kaarywahi shuru hui, vipaksh ke netaa vijender gupta ne is satr ko galat qaraar dete hue kaha ki niyamon ke mutabik nae saal ke pehle satr ke liye parampara nirdhaarit he
 Vijender Gupta said that the first session in the rule is addressed by the Lieutenant Governor every time, but this time it was not done
 gupta ne kaha kisarkaar parampara tod rahi haior uskaa sanvaidhanik paramparaon par bharosa nahin he
 Assembly Speaker Ramnivas Goyal objected to Gupta's allegation
 spikar ne kaha ki aisa pehali baar nahin hua he, balki pehle bhi hota rahaa he
 The speaker of the assembly argued that this session is not new but only the second part of the previous session

 In this session, the ruling party mlas adopted the strategy of encircling the bjp-ruled MCD and targeted the BJP mayors and councilors over the strike that took place in the past
 upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki bijepi ke parshad gaiyrkanoonee nirmaan karaane main vyast hai or emsidi bhrashtachar kaa adda ban gai he
 Manish Sisodia said that the Delhi government gave 119 crore rupees to the MCD but due to political reasons, the MCD leaders went on strike
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ko paise kaa hisaab dena chahie
 The Leader of the Opposition, on the contrary, tried to surround the government in the matter of funds and said that the government was making them financially weak by not giving full amount of money to MCD
 aisa nagar nigam ke chunaavon ke maddenjar bijepi ke satta vaali nigamon ko badnaam karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 At 5 pm on March 21, Congress President Sonia Gandhi made a call
 unhone punjab ke purv mukhyamantri se kaha, ''amarinder, main chaahati hum ki aap amritsar se chunaav laden
 i think you are the right person for this job
 aapako kuch bhi chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin
 i will help you in every way
 ” sadak ke raste dilli se chandigarh ja rahe captain amarinder singh ne neshnal hive-1 par apni gaadi kinare khadi kii or turant haa kar di
 But they were quite surprised by this sudden call
 sonia gandhi kaa is tarah anurodh karnaa asaamaanya baat thi, khaskar tab, jab unhone teen hafte pehle unase mulaakaat karke loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye kii anichhaa jataai thi or sonia ne apni sahmati bhi de di thi
 On March 19, two days ago, when Sonia's political secretary Ahmed Patel discussed the possibility with Amarinder, she refused to contest the election as she had received Sonia's approval
 unhone kuch tivi intervyuu main bhi apni anichhaa jataa di thi
 After about an hour of this phone, Rahul also sent a message to her on mobile: "thank you, you will stand and fight
 ”party ke bahut-se varisht netaaon kii raay main 10 janpath se sidhe kiye jane vaale phone congress ke pratham parivaar kii nai koshish kaa sanket hai, jisamen yah parivaar apni ranneeti kii ekajutata kaa sanket de rahaa he: sonia or unki santan rahul or priyanka apni alag-alag koshishon ke baavjood milakar kaam kar rahe hai, taaki samuhik shakti paidaa kar saken
 Sonia may have handed over the reins of the 2014 general election to son Rahul, but she is still the president of the party and has complete control over the party
 is tarah ve hi sarvesarva hai
 Congressmen say the signal is clear: they are the real bosses when needed
 is chunaav main varisht netaaon ko khadaa karne se lekar alpsankhyakon ko yah sandesh dene tak ki dharmanirpeksh voton ko bantane mat do, sonia vah sab kuch kar rahi hai, jo party adhyaksh ke taur par unase ummid kii jaati he
 And now Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is considered a trump card for the party, has also come into the fray
 is chunaav main unhone dhire-dhire kai bhoomikaayen le lee hai
 As Rahul's invisible manager and principal advisor and even more important, she is acting as a bridge between Rahul's new Congress and the party's old stalwarts
 congress main yah bhoomika lambey samay se gaayab thi or party ke patan kii mukhya vajahon main yah bhi ek badi vajah thi
 Apart from this, Priyanka is also very important in Amethi and Rae Bareli, which are considered to be safe bastions of the family
 congress ke apane anumaanon ke hisaab se party ab tak kaa sabase kharaab pradarshan karne ja rahi he, aise main is parivaar ke paas bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko rokane main rahul kii madad karne ke sivaae koi chaara nahin he

 Madhavan, after calling Amarinder Singh on 21 March, rang several calls for two consecutive days
 sonia ne purv kendriya mantri ambika soni ko punjab ke anandpur sahib se parchaa bharne ko kaha
 State Legislature Party leader Sunil Jakhar was asked to start campaigning in the border area of ferozepur
 congress adhyaksh ne kendriya swasthya mantri gulam nabi aaazaad se jammu-kashmir ke udhampur se chunaav ladgaye ko kaha or rahul se kaha gaya ki ve madhusudan mistre ke liye kade mukaable kii seat kaa chayan karen
 He is now in the fray against Narendra Modi from Vadodara
 chunavi maidan se aa rahi khabaron se yahi pataa chalata he ki diggaj yaa logon main vishesh rasookh rakhane vaale netaaon ko utaarne kii sonia kii ranneeti kaa asar dikhne laga he
 Even before Amarinder reached Amritsar on March 28, the news of his nomination fell silent in the ruling Akali dal-bjp camp
 isse pehle vahaan purv kendriya mantri arun jetali ke liye behad aasaan chunaav maanakar khushiyon kaa alam tha
 In such a situation, many people are considering Sonia's strategy as a cynic
 ek congress mahasachiv ke mutabik, amarinder ko pratyaashee banane se party ko ummid he ki jetali (jinhen amarinder apane bhaashanon main ''dilli se aae hamaare sammanit mehmaan” kehete hai) 30 april tak amritsar main hi bandha jaaenge or tab tak kul nau main se saat charnon ke chunaav sampann ho jaaenge
 Jaitley is the chief strategist of his party and his absence at the center could harm the party
 sonia ne bhrashtachar ke daag hone ke baavjood maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan ko nanded or pawan kumaar bansal ko chandigarh se tikat dilvaaya
 Not giving him a ticket would mean accepting a crime even though both the cases are pending
 march main association of democratic riforms kii report ke mutabik, bijepi ne aapraadhik prishthbhumi ke 35 pratishat ummidavaar utaare hai jabaki congress kii suchi main aise ummidavaar 27 pratishat hi hai
 If Rahul had walked, Chavan would not have got the ticket
 bataate hai, sonia ne congress chunaav samiti ko kaha ki maratha vot bank ko aakarshith karne or vilasarav deshmukh ke nidhan ke baad nae netaa ko viksit karne ke liye chavaan ko tikat dena jaruri he
 With this clever initiative, the chances of Chavan becoming a rebel were eliminated
 ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki chandigarh main bansal ko khadaa karne se congress mukaable main laut ai he
 There he is pitted against two external candidates, Kiran Kher of BJP and Gul Panag of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 congress ke ghoshnaptr jari karne ke kaarykram main 26 march ko jab ek patrkaar ne chavaan ko tikat dene ke bare main sawaal kiya to sonia tapaak se boleen, ''main jawaab duungi
 "and started saying," As far as we know, no law prevents Chavan from contesting elections
 ” unke tikhe jawaab or aakraamak tevar ne saaf sandesh de diya ki kai congress netaa aise hai jinka party netritv na sirf bachaav karegaa, balki party safai ke naam par jitau pratyaashiyon ko katai qurbaan nahin karegi
 This attitude is different from Rahul's way
 yahi ravaiya saharanpur main pratyaashee imran masood ke maamle main bhi apanaaya gaya
 Despite her arrest on March 29 for comments on Modi, Sonia allegedly sent a message through Patel to the Uttar Pradesh unit that Rahul's rally in Saharanpur would not be canceled on the same day
 masood kii giraftaar se sahanubhuti kii lahar paidaa ho gai he
 The Saharanpur seat has a 42 percent Muslim population and the sympathy wave may affect the adjacent seats as well
 masood kii giraftaar ke din hi shaam 4 baje ke aas-paas rahul saharanpur main manch par masood kii patni ke saath the
 Rahul said in his speech that Masood made this remark when he was in the Samajwadi Party and the Congress has nothing to do with it
 party sutron ke mutabik, sthaneey soochnaaon par yakeen karne kii sonia kii ranneeti se sthiti congress ke paksh main gai he
 If Congress leaders are to be believed, more and more party candidates are demanding that Sonia should come to campaign in his constituency
 unhone 30 march ko dilli se prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 "she always leaves a mark with her actions and gestures," says a party general secretary on the mother's and son's political outlook and manner, while Rahul talks about the broader scenario and talks in principle
 donon kii apni-apni style he
 Priyanka has increased her activism when both the time and support are seen slipping out of the hands of the Congress, adding the Priyanka wire
 jab se rahul gandhi ko party ke chehre ke taur par pesh kiya gaya, priyanka ne na sirf prachaar abhiyaan balki baikaroom oparation kii puri kaman sambhaal rakhi he
 Sources close to Priyanka also confirmed this in a conversation with India Today
 ek sahyogi kaa kahana tha, ''is parivaar (gandhi) ke paas or koi vikalp nahin he
 Rahul does not have time to see everything
 ek hafte ke bheetar ve desh ke vibhinn hisson main yojit sabhaaon ko sambodhit karne main vyast ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, the responsibility can be given to the person whom Rahul can fully trust and who can take decisions in their absence
 ”iske baad bhi gandhi parivaar or party, donon hi ise saarvajanik karne yaa iske bare main baatcheet se parhez kar rahe hai
 That is why Priyanka holds meetings with important Congress leaders and various agencies ranging from campaigning to strategy making, except at her residence, 35 Lodhi Estate and Congress office, 24 Akbar Road
 priyanka akasar ek varisht party netaa se raay-mashvira karti hai
 "many times it happens that they reach 12 Tughlaq Lane (rahul's official residence) at 10 am and continue to hold meetings till midnight," said this leader
 party or apane bhai kii chunavi sambhaavnaaen behatar karne main ve ji-jaan se juty hai
 From the party's slogan to which public meeting Rahul will raise, his decision is final
 ”kabhi ve rahul ke sarkari awaas kii bajaae nai dilli ke rajendra prasad road par jawahar bhawan main rajeev gandhi foundation (arjief) ke daftar yaa 6 mahadev road sthit offis main baithak karti hai jahaan parivaar ke nirvachan kshetron amethi or raibareli ke voter apni chintaaen lekar pahunchate hai
 Priyanka had taken a small step after the Congress' downturn in the 2012 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, which remained confined to Amethi and Rae Bareli
 ve in do loksabhaa kshetron main niyamit taur par jane lageen
 In the last six months, he has completely transformed the organization at the local level in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 block adhyakshon or sanyojakon se baatcheet or nijee taur par chaanbin ke aadhaar par unhone party padaadhikari niyukt kiye hai
 Now she has come out of the purview of these two Lok Sabha constituencies
 ek kendriya mantri ne bataaya, ''sab kuch yojana ke anusaar ho, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ve un rajyon ke congressi mukhyamantriyon or pradesh party adhyakshon se baatcheet karti hai jahaan rahul ko janaa hota he
 “the responsibility of meeting and negotiating with various leaders has been entrusted to Rahul's trusted aide Kanishka Singh
 loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke vibhinn charnon, ranneeti taiyaar karne se lekar use jameen par utaarne tak priyanka parde ke peeche se shashakt bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai
 His colleagues say, "if RAW listens to anyone, then they are Priyanka
" ” dilli main 17 janvari ko eisisi satr main rahul ke aakraamak bhaashan ke masaude kii ruparekha priyanka ne hi tay kii thi
 Priyanka, Rahul, Sonia, Ahmed Patel and Kanishka read the speech over and over and made about 15 changes in the initial draft
 satr se do din pehle rahul ne 12-tughlaq len main der raat priyanka ke saamne bhaashan kii reharsal kii to priyanka ne unhen bhaashan ke samay bhavpurn, saath hi aakraamak andaaj rakhane kaa suzav bhi diya tha
 From then onwards, she takes care of which issues are to be raised in which public meeting, Rahul should be informed first
 aise bhi maukey aae jab congress kaa andruni raaj khul saktaa tha, jaise 7 janvari ko
 Priyanka held a meeting with party leaders at Rahul's absence
 maujuud netaaon main ahamed patel, mistre, janardan dvivedi, ajay maakan or arjief ke mohan gopal the
 According to sources, after the party's defeat in the December 8 assembly elections, some "senior party leaders had raised serious objections" to Rahul's plan to circumvent the proposed changes and that is why Rahul returned to Europe
 Moved forward
 ab varisht netaaon or rahul ke bich matbhedon ko dur karne kaa kaam priyanka par chhod diya gaya
 Priyanka is considered far more mature in agreeing between disagreements
 phir bhi, is baithak kii khabar baahar failane se congress ke hosh ud gaye or party main afratfari kaa maahaul ban gaya
 "there is a natural consensus for Priyanka in the party," says a Congress leader and Union minister
 agar party maamalon main unki badhati sakriyata kii baat li hoti he to unke liye badi bhoomika kii maang khadi ho sakati he jo rahul ke lihaaj se thik nahin hoga
 "earlier, Janardan Dwivedi had refused to attend that meeting
 jab unhen pataa chalaa ki tivi camaron ne unhen 12-tughlaq len se nikalate samay kaid kar liya he, to unhen bayaan jari karnaa padaa ki ''priyanka congress kii sakriy rajnatik kaaryakarta hai or ve lambey samay se party kaaryakartaaon se milti rahi hai
 If she meets party leaders, what is shocking? ” Dwivedi's statement is a confirmation of Priyanka's height within the party
 party kii chunavi ranneeti se jude noujvaan netaa priyanka kii sakriyata ke bare main kahin khulkar baaten karte hai
 Asked about Priyanka's new role, the party's Chief Electoral Strategist Jairam Ramesh said, "he is not a sanyasin
 unke paas tej rajnatik dimag he
 We are important sources in terms of ideas and information
 unke kai suzav maan liye jate hai
 "priyanka has always been active in the elections," says Ramesh, who has played an important role in the three Lok Sabha elections since 2004, but this time the competition is the most difficult
 ve kehete hai, ''is baar kii chunauti zyada badi he
 We face a 10-year anti-incumbency and an aggressive opposition
 ”is mushkil chunaav ke vakt priyanka ke saath ne rahul kaa aatmavishvaas badhaayaa he
 Apart from finalizing Rahul's speeches, campaigning and publicity material, Priyanka also monitors the performance of party spokespersons in TV discussions
 priyanka kii feedback main na sirf pravaktaaon ke bolchaal ke tareekon balki unke pahanaave or haav-bhav kaa bhi baarik hisaab-kitaab hota he
 Recently a spokesperson was participating in the discussion during prime time TV news wearing a T-shirt
 priyanka ne kanishka singh ko yah baat bataai or is tarah feedback sanchaar vibhaag tak pahunch gaya
 Close to Rahul are Kanishka, Kaushal Vidyarthi, Alankar Sawai and B
 biju vaise to priyanka ko report nahin karte, lekin rahul se judi ek-ek baat se unhen avgat karaate rahete hai
 Often Priyanka keeps calling any of them and gets information
 ranneeti se jude masalon par ve kai baar jaruri suzav bhi detii hai
 She talks or meets the same leaders whom she considers necessary to meet
 sutara kehete hai ki agar baat chunaav abhiyaan se judi na ho, to priyanka party ke rosemara ke kaamkaaj se khud ko alag hi rakhti hai
 It is not difficult to understand the reasons why Priyanka is playing the main role in making the election strategy of the party advocating the change and enhancing Rahul's image
 congress ke saamne jahaan chunavi chunautiyaan munh baae khadi hai vahiin votaron ko rijhaane main gandhi parivaar kii apni yogyata bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Party workers are skeptical because of repeated failures in Rahul and his prolonged absence from the scene
 sonia ne unhen kaaphi khulaa maidan diya he
 Rahul has been hesitant to enter that ground
 udhar kai morchon par sarkaar kii asafalataaon ne pehle hi party kaa patan tej kar diya he
 Sonia has stopped Priyanka, a charismatic personality rich, from moving forward
 unhen dar he ki priyanka kaa vyaktitv apane bhai par baari pad jayega
 People in the party believe that the changes that Rahul had promised, are not only delayed in showing their effects, but they also pose a risk of causing many problems
 lekin sabko saath lekar chalane kii apni kaaryastylee kii vajah se priyanka apane bhai rahul or un netaaon ke bich pul kaa kaam kar rahi hai, jinhen rahul pasand nahin karte
 "the Congress president took too long to decide to include Priyanka," says a leader considered close to the Gandhi family
 ” unki baat se pataa chalata he ki is chunaav main party ko ubaarane main ab der ho chuki he
 But this can be expected in the future
 ”vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey gandhi parivaar ke liye chetavanee the
 By the beginning of last year, internal survey of the party revealed that the Congress would face defeat
 lekin use kareeb 150 siten milane kaa anumaan tha
 Then an internal survey conducted in January 2014 showed that it was getting only 75 seats
 rahul haalanki lagaataar party main vyavasthaagat parivartan laane or use chust-durust karne kii koshish main jute rahe, lekin vidhansabha ke nateezon ne saaf kar diya ki is samay party ke patan ko rokna taatkaalik chunauti he
 Sonia and Priyanka have stepped in late, now they have to think how much they can reduce this loss
 party ko na sirf 10 saal kii satta virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa saamana karnaa he, balki use party main girte manobal ko bhi bachaana he
 If Rahul is successful, he will introduce a new system in which many party leaders feel that there will be no room for him

 achaanak daravaaje par mukhyamantri ke dastak dene se log hairaan ho jate hai
 He has a special focus on people living in slums and villages
 mamata banerjee is sarprise politics se janata kaa dil jeetne kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 It is a matter of discussion that Mamata Banerjee is following this bet on the advice of election strategist Prashant Kishor
 isi kadi main beete somvaar (26 agast) ko mamata banerjee ne bardhaman-purba kshetra ke aleesha baikunthpur gaanv pahunchakar logon ko hairaan kar diya
 Suddenly, seeing the Chief Minister in front of the house, people could not understand anything
 vajah ki unhen pataa hi nahin tha ki is tarah achaanak mukhyamantri pahunchakar unki samasyaayein nipataane main jute jaaengi
 Mamta Banerjee started the surprise visit from 19 August

 Before going to the meeting, she suddenly reached the slum of Howrah number two round tank lane

 When the doors opened, they came to know about their problems by talking to women, children and men
 pataa chalaa ki jhuggi-jhopadiyon main rahane waalon ko pani, safai, rashan aadi kii dikkatein hai
 After seeing the reality of the slums, Mamata reached the meeting and she lashed out at the officers in the meeting

 The challenge of saving the land and the base, as the BJP is strengthening in West Bengal, is causing a stir in the Trinamool Congress camp

 In this area, Chinese troops near the border are trying to build a bridge
 darasal, doklam par 55 dinon se baukhala rahaa china ab bharat ko ladakh ke raste gherne kii jugat main lag gaya he
 In Doklam, the Chinese forces were plotting to tamper with the status quo of the disputed area by constructing the road, while the Chinese troops have also come out to show such grandeur near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh
 no mans land yani donon deshon ke sarhad ke bich bhi chini fouj apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahi he
 In fact, apart from Doklam, there are many points on the border dispute between the two countries, from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal, India and more than 4000 km long border of China
 jahaan par koi vivaad nahin he vahaan bhi china bevajaah aakraamak rukh dikhaata rahata he
 It is believed that China is increasing pressure on other points of the border as part of a new strategy to bring India under pressure on Doklam
 lekin china shaayad bhul gaya ki doklam main use 55 dinon se ghutane par bithakar rakhane vaali bhartiya fouj ladakh main bhi utani hi mustaid or chaukas he jitanisarhad kekisi bhi hisse main
 Whether it is a blood-stained cold or a snowstorm, no one can stop the steps of the Indian soldiers guarding the border here

 Border personal meetings have been held in Laddak between the army of the two countries on LAC for a long time, but this time China has also stopped this process
 donon deshon kii senaaon ke bich ye baithken daulat beg oldy kshetra main hoti thim
 Half the meetings were held in Indian and half in the Chinese region
 is baar doklam vivaad ke chalate chini sena ne in baithkon ke liye koi pahal nahin kii
 But apart from this disinterested and bigotry of China, Indian soldiers are trying to make this area of the border ready to be ready for every situation

 In fact, at one place, Pradhan read 'samsuchit' as 'proper', after which President Ramnath Kovind stopped him
 haalanki baad main pradhan ne ise sahi-sahi pard diya
 After Pradhan's mistake, people also took to Twitter and tweeted him fiercely

 lambey samay se bharat koshish kar rahaa he ki vah sanyukt raashtra kii sthai sadsyta paa jaae
 This is because India today ranks among the top economies of the world

 Also, for its security, there is a country armed with a large army as well as a nuclear weapon
 iske alaava krishi utpaadan ke kshetra main bhi vah kai fasalon main agrani he
 And most importantly, it is the only country in the world where 40 percent of the population is young, which is the largest part of the global workforce

 How was the Taj crowned? After this, there was a continuous attack of Muslims to take this number one crown from India and as a result, the rule of Muslims was established on this Asian region

 is dauraan england ne apana union jaik duniya ke lagbhag teen-chauthai hisse par fahraaya
 The title was successful in snatching the title from England after World War i and World War II
 america ne bhi yah kaam aise samay par kiya jab uski jansankhya main yuva adhikansh the or usne puure vishwa ke liye yuddh samagri kaa utpaadan kar apane liye number van kaa khitaab tay kar liya
 After World War America, America remained at number one till the 1980s, though at the same time China was getting ready for number one with the help of its large population and fast growing economy
 apni badi jansankhya ke saath puri duniya ke liye manuphaccharing hub banane kii kavayad ke sahare aaj china ko duniya main number van mana ja rahaa he
 Global experts also claim that China can save the title of this number one for another decade only because now China has lost the benefit of the young population and its population is now aging
 ise bhi padhein: china ke CPEC jhaanse main fansaa pakistan to greece jaise honge halaat?beete kai varshon se vaishvik str ke jaankaron samet kai antarrashtriya vittiya sansthaaen daawa kar chuki hai ki aane vaale dashak ek baar phir bharat ko number van kii sthiti par pahunchane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Why expect from India? a recent Harvard University research claimed that India would be the main focal point of global economic growth in the coming decade and would remain ahead of China
 uniwarsity ke is research main haalanki, aane vaale dashak main global iconomic growth main lagaataar susti kaa daur jari rahane kii bhi chetavanee bhi di gai thi or daawa kiya gaya tha ki is susti ke dauraan bharat teji se aage badhegaa or china ko peeche chhodte hue number van banane main safal ho jayega
 India 7 by 2025 according to Saharrisarch, the fastest growing economy
 7 fisadi vaarshaki vruddhi ke saath duniya kii sabase teji se badhane vaali arthvyavastha bani rahengi
 In its estimates of economic growth presented by researchers at Harvard University's International Development Center, the main focus of global economic activity has shifted from China to neighboring India over the past few years
 report ke mutabik agle ek dashak tak bharat hi aarthik gatividhiyon kaa mukhya kendra bane rahane kii sambhaavna he
 In the coming times, the growth rate of emerging markets is expected to be faster than the developed economies
 lihaaja, ek baat saaf he ki yadi agle ek dashak main bharat apni yuva jansankhya or tej bhaagti arthvyavastha kaa phayda uthaate hue number van banane main safal nahin hua to sambhav he ki koi or desh yah khitaab lene ke liye taiyaar ho jaae
 In such a situation, if India misses this opportunity, then it will have to wait a long time to reach such a situation

 (input from news agency PTI) rajd pramukh lalu prasad ko badi raahat pradaan karte hue ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha ki unke tathaa unki patni ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main bihar sarkaar ko patna ucch nyaayalay main apil daayar karne kaa adhikaar nahin he jisamen sibiai dwaara abhiyog chalaaya gaya tha
 a bench of Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan and Justice RM Lodha and Justice BS Chauhan said, "the Bihar government is not a competent agency to file an appeal in the case
" ’ yah faisla lalu prasad or unki patni tathaa sibiai dwaara bhi daayar kii gai apil ko sweekaar kar paarit kiya gaya
 The appeal challenged the decision of the Patna High Court to accept the appeal of the Bihar government against the acquittal by the special CBI court
 faisle kaa swaagat karte hue lalu prasad ne patna main kaha ki unka nyapalika main bharosa he
 The state government filed an appeal on its behalf after the CBI did not challenge the acquittal
 faisla sunaate hue nyaayamurti lodha ne kaha ki maamle main sirf centre or sibiai hi sakasham abhikaran hai jo apil daayar kar sakate hai tathaa kanoon ke tahat rajya sarkaar nichali adaalat ke faisle ko chunauti dene ke adhikaar se baahar he
 On December 18, 2006, Special CBI Judge Muni Lal Paswan acquitted Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi from the case in which Lalu was accused of acquiring assets worth Rs 46 lakh more than his known sources of income when he was from 1990 to 1997
 Chief Minister was among yah jaanane ke baad ki lalu or unki patni ko bari kiye jane ke faisle ko sibiai chunauti nahin de rahi bihar sarkaar ne nichali adaalat ke nirnay ke khilaaf ucch nyaayalay main apil daayar kii
 The High Court said that the Bihar government's appeal challenging the acquittal of them (lalu and his wife) in a disproportionate assets case is admissible and can be considered under Section 378 of the crpc
 bihar sarkaar ke is kadam par sawaal uthaate hue sibiai ne apni yachika main kaha ki nitish kumaar sarkaar ko apil daayar karne kaa adhikaar nahin he kyonki maamle kii jaanch uske dwaara (sibiai) kii gai thi or rajya sarkaar centre ke kaaryakari faisle ke khilaaf kaam nahin kar sakati
 Lalu Prasad and his wife took the same stand
 ucchtam nyaayalay main das march ko antim sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai or rajd pramukh ne bihar sarkaar ke apil daayar karne ke faisle kaa virodh kiya jisamen aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main lalu ko bari kiye jane ko chunauti di gai thi
 The Bihar government, however, argued that it had the right to file an appeal against the acquittal because the CBI had done the investigation and prosecution of the crime in the state
 usne tark diya ki siarpisi kii dhara 378 (2) centre ko sibiai kii jaanch vaale maamalon main apil ke sawaal par faisla karne ke liye sirf atirikt shakti pradaan karti he
 The Bihar government supported the High Court's decision to accept the appeal against the acquittal of the RJD chief and his wife in the case

 The Aam Aadmi Party has requested that either VVPAT machines be used along with all the evms in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections or the election can be carried forward for a few days to conduct the elections with paper ballot

 After meeting Aam Aadmi Party leaders Arvind Kejriwal himself reached the office of the Delhi Election Commission, where he met the Chief Election Officer and demanded that the elections be put on hold for a few days until the State Election Commission got the new evms installed
 
 arvind kejariwal kaha ki ‘saal 2013 main supreme court ne kaha tha ki vivipat ke saath iviem ke madhyam se chunaav karana zyada vishwasaneey he, iske alaava haal hi main upi chunaav ayog ne kendriya chunaav ayog ko patr likhakar ye kaha he ki wo uttar pradesh main jenereshan 1 kii puraani mashiinon se chunaav nahin karana chaahate kyonki wo mashine karaab hai or unhen paper ballat se vahaan ke local or civik chunaav karaane kii izaazat di jaaen
 While the Chief Electoral Officer flatly refused to put the dates for the election, Kejriwal claims that the Election Officer has assured him to talk to the Central Election Commission to get new machines for the corporation elections
 kejariwal ne kaha ki jenereshan 1 kii iviem mashine kharaab hai or unki jagah paper ballat se chunaav karana behatar vikalp he

 The Aam Aadmi Party quoted the Delhi Election Commission as Section 4 of the Delhi Municipal Act, stating that under the rule there is a provision that the corporation election can be carried forward, but for this the central government will have to write it and the decision to the central government Have to take
 aise main jabaki chunaav main bas ek haftaa bachaa he or aise main agar paper ballat yaa nai iviem ke saath vivipat kaa bandobast nahin ho paata he to chunaav ko diemasi act ke section 4 ke tahat aage badhaayaa jaaen
 However, the Delhi Election Commission rejected the demand of the Aam Aadmi Party

 bihar congress main antarkalah maamle main ek saptaah ke bheetar faisla ke bare main puche jane par party sutron ne aaj kaha, ‘sthiti saaf kerani hogi’
 The remarks are being seen as a signal for the party's state unit chief to be replaced

 jat land ke naam se mashhoor pashchim upi ke chunavi maahaul main ek kahawat badi charchaa main rahati he, wo he 'jiskaa jat, uske thaath' yani jis party yaa pratyaashee ko jat votaron kaa samarthan mil jaae uski naiya paar lag hi jaati he
 The challenge of securing similar support is in front of Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate Jayant Chaudhary and Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Satyapal Singh from Baghpat seat
 donon jat netaa hai
 This has been the stronghold of Jayant's family and Satyapal Singh first landed in the Electoral Styx in 2014 after assuming the responsibility of Police Commissioner
 jayant choudhary kii dagar thodaa zyada mushkil bhari he, kyonki yah seat yun to unke dada choudhary charan singh va pita choudhary ajit singh kii viraasat rahi he, lekin 2014 main jab modi lahar chali to satyapal singh ne jayant choudhary ke pita choudhary ajit singh ko haraate hue unke parivaar kii is seat par apana kabja jamaa liya
 Now Ajit Singh is fighting from Muzaffarnagar seat and Jayant Chaudhary is trying his luck for the first time from Baghpat
 jaaton kaa garh maane jane vaali bagpat seat par 1977, 1980 or 1984 main lagaataar purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh ne jeet darj kii
 After this, his son Chaudhary Ajit Singh was MP from this seat 6 times
 choudhary ajit singh 1989, 1991, 1996, 1999, 2004 or 2009 main bagpat se saansad nirvaachit hue
 In 1998 and 2014, RLD (RLD) had to face defeat here after Chaudhary Charan Singh started contesting from this seat
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jayant choudharybagapat main ralod kii badshahath kii sabase ahm vajah yahaan jat votaron kii adhikta hi he
 There are more than four lakh Jat voters in this seat
 inke alaava gurjar, yadav, dalit or tyaagi voter bhi bagpat kii ladaai main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he, jabaki muslim votaron kii bhi yahaan badi taadaad he
 The interesting thing is that most of the Muslim voters here are called Mula Jats
 yahi sameekaran ab tak yahaan kisaan netaa ke rup main mashhoor charan singh va unke bete ajit singh ko sansad pahunchaata rahaa he
 But in 2014, Satyapal Singh of BJP wrested this seat from Chaudhary Ajit Singh in Modi wave
 itnaa hi nahin, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi areldi ko yahaan jhatka laga tha or use mahaj ek vidhansabha seat (chhaprauli) par jeet mili thi
 Whereas BJP had won on Siwalkhas, Barout, Baghpat and Modinagar seats
 niraashajanak rahe the 2014 ke nateezeypane hi garh main choudhary ajit singh ke liye 2014 ke chunaav nattejey kaaphi niraashajanak rahe the or wo tisare number par rahe the
 Satyapal Singh of BJP got 4,23,475 votes, Ghulam Mohammad of SP 213,609 votes and Chaudhary Ajit Singh of RLD 1,99,516 votes
 haalanki, is baar halaat juda hai or sapa-basapa va areldi milakar chunaav lard rahe hai
 BJP candidate from Baghpat seat Satyapal Singh, however, Shivpal Singh Yadav, who split from SP and formed a separate party, has definitely fielded a Muslim candidate as Chaudhary Mohammad Mohkam
 aise main sapa ke saath milakar lard rahi areldi jeet ko lekar bade daawey kar rahi he
 However, Jayant Chaudhary is trying his luck from this seat for the first time
 2009 main pehali baar unhone mathura seat se jeet darj kii thi, lekin 2014 main bijepi kii hema malini ne unhen yahaan se haraa diya tha, jiske baad ab jayant choudhary apane purakhon kii viraasat sanbhaalane pahunche hai
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see, whom do Jats do their chic by giving their votes

 After the attacks in Sonitpur and Kokrajhar districts of Assam, the central government has shown strict attitude
 sena ne assam police or siesuef ke saath milakarpratibandhit sanghathan neshnal democratic front of bodoland (endiefabi)ke khilaaf 'oparation ol out' shuru kiya he
 This organization has been raising demands for a separate state for the Bodo tribal community in Assam for the last several years
 kendra ne saaf kar diya he ki kisi bhi str paraugravadiyon ke saath baatcheetanhin hogi
 Children and women were also not spared in Sonitpur and Kokrajhar
 bodo ugravadiyon kaa ye tabilani hamalaa peshawar hamale kii tarah hi bhayanak sabit hua, jisamen 70 se zyada logon ko apni jindagi se haath dhonaa padaa
 This issue is not new in Assam
 bangladesh or bhutan kii seemaa se lage assam main kai varshon se jaateey hinsa ek badi pareshaani bani hui he
 Bodo militants have been targeting non-bodo people here
 assam rajya kii kul aabaadi 3 karod se zyada he jisamen takreeban 10 fisadi bodo jati ke hai
 Actually the root of this dispute is related to infiltration from Bangladesh and the conflict with the Muslims settled here
 inakon yahaan basaane ke peeche kahin naa kahin tatkaaleen sarkaron ke siyaasi makasad bhi rahe
 Congress governments in Assam have been accused of settling Bangladeshi Muslims here for votes
 pehle se sarkaar virdohi soch rakhane vaale bodo adivasee inhen sharan die jane se ugr ho gaye or phir alag rajya kii maang ke saath shuru hua katl-e-aam kaa daur
 The Government of India established the Bodo Regional Council (BTC) in Assam to settle this dispute
 jo vahaan khud se prashasnic faisle karti he lekin kanoon vyavastha kii jimmedaari rajya sarkaar kii he
 Bodo militants are not satisfied with BTC
 is masale ko or pechida banaaya bodo ugravadiyon ke khilaaf khadey hue do sanghathanon ne
 non-bodo Suraksha Manch and Akhil Bodoland Muslim Students Association are against the demand for separate Bodo State
 jab in sanghathanon ke sadsy bodo ugravadiyon ke saamne aate hai to bhi khoonkhraba hota he
 In 2012, more than 100 non-bodos were killed and about 40 thousand people had to take shelter elsewhere
 ab bharat sarkaar ne bodo ugravadi sanghathan endiefabi se nipatane kii yojana par kaam to shuru kiya he
 But the question is, will they be emboldened by retaliation? Will these people put arms before the army? Is the solution to this serious problem possible by killing some Bodo militants? It does not seem so
 kyonki bodo ugravadiyon ne bhutan or myanmar main apane camp sthapit kar liye hai
 From here they are also getting modern weapons like AK-47
 haalanki sena ne in ugravadiyon ke khilaaf shuru kiye apane taaja abhiyaan main china, bhutan or myanmar ko bhi shaamil kiya he lekin dekhnaa hoga ki yah mishan kitna kargar sabit hoga
