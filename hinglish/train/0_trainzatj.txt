 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film

 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history

 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years

 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian

 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home

 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India

 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India

 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai

 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he

 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion

 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya

 nirvachan ayog kii manaahi ke baavjood bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke netaa binar-poster main sena kii tasviir kaa upyog karne kaa moh nahin chhod paa rahe hai
 BJP MP from Jaipur Ramcharan Bohra has put a picture of himself and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on every street corner of the city with army and combat ships
 jaipur main is tarah ke binar poster har jagah dikh jaaenge
 It is written on the poster that the terrorists entered and killed Pakistan
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar nirvachan ayog ne chunavi postaron main sena ke siyaasi istemaal par pabandi laga rakhi he
 But it seems that if the MP is not getting anything to count his work, then he has started capitalizing on the valor of the army
 haalanki sawaal kiye jane par saansad safai dete rahe
 Ramcharan Bohra said that he did not put these posters for the election

 mahadevan) on Sep 21, 2018 at 11:43 pm PDT congress main in dinon twitor par follow-anfolo karne kaa chakkar lagaataar surkhiyaan bator rahaa he
 What the leaders, what activists and journalists have discussed among everyone is how true this is in the politics of Twitter
 sabase pehle congress main rahete hue gujarat ke netaa shankar singh waghela ne rahul gandhi ko twitor par anfolo kiya, tab se hi sanket mila ki, ab waghela congress se dur ja rahe hai
 This happened later
 iske baad naam aayaa purv vitt mantri pi
 The special thing about Chidambaram, who followed only five people on Twitter, was that Rahul Gandhi was not included in it, whereas, on the contrary, Rahul Gandhi himself has been following Chidambaram
 haalanki, charchaa tej hone par chidambaram ne haal hi main rahul gandhi ko twitor par follow karnaa shuru kar diya
 There was also a clarification from Chidambaram that he does not run his own Twitter handle, so there is no question of following and unfollowing
 ab isi bich taaja maamla aayaa purv kendriya mantri kapil sibbal kaa
 Suddenly, Sibal's Twitter handle unfollowed Rahul Gandhi
 waghela ke vivaad ke baad congress ke galiyaaron main hadakamp much gaya
 The social media department of Congress got upset that how should they respond to this news that is going viral on social media
 aakhirkaar is mudde par sibbal se jab charchaa kii gai to sibbal ne kaha ki, aakhir wo aisa kyon karenge
 After this, Sibal spoke to his staff and told that, his staff had gone to fix the ipad, it happened by mistake, along with Rahul many people unfollowed by deception
 iske baad jaakar party ke netaaon or soshal media kii jaan main jaan aayi
 Then Sibal immediately followed the office of RG i
e
 Rahul
 vaise dilachasp he ki, sibbal kaa maamla uthne ke baad hi chidambaram ne rahul ko follow karnaa shuru kiya he
 But Twitter's story does not end here
 haal mencongressi netaonpar sultanate jane ke baad bhi sultan kii tarah vyavhaar karne kii tohamat jadne vaale jairam ramesh ke naam kaa twitor handle ab charchaa kaa vishay he
 a Twitter account named Jairam Ramesh, considered close to Rahul Gandhi, only follows four people on Twitter, including Rahul Gandhi
 is par dabi jubaan se congressiyon kaa kahana he ki, jo apane netaa ko follow nahin karne kii haisiyat rakhe, asal main to vahi sultan he
 But when Aaj Tak asked Jairam Ramesh about this, he gave a clear answer that, he is not on Twitter, he does not have a Twitter account, neither can he tweet nor retweet
 saath hijayram nekaha ki, aage bhi unka twitor par aane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 Actually, the Twitter account running in the name of Jairam Ramesh is not verified, but Jairam's opponents made it a weapon to pinch Jairam
 kul milakar congress kii dilachasp twitor gaatha philhal jari he
 In the Kejriwal government, the expenditure incurred on foreign visits by ministers has become a mystery
 bijepi vidhayak opi sharma kii ore se vidhansabha main sawaal poocha gaya ki sarkaar mantriyon or vidhayakon kii videsh yatraaon par hue kharch kaa khulaasa kyon nahin kar rahi
 Meanwhile, the government maintains that the information is still being collected 5 months ago
 dilli vidhansabha kaa monsoon satr chal rahaa he or is satr main ek baar phir mantriyon or vidhayakon se jude videshi yatraaon ko lekar sawaal poocha gaya
 But the answer was neither found in the month of March nor was it found now
 darasal, vishwaas nagar se bijepi vidhayak omprakash sharma ne sarkaar se mantriyon or vidhayakon ke videshi dauron ke sambandh main jaankaree maangi thi
 But in response to this, it was written that information about foreign visits is being collected from various departments of Delhi Government
 saath hi kaha gaya ki soochna ekatrit hone ke baad use sadan ke patal par rakh diya jayega
 Surprisingly in this whole matter, the same question was asked when AAP MLA Akhilesh Pati Tripathi from Model Town five months ago during the assembly session in March 2018
 tab bhi jawaab kuch aisa hi diya gaya tha
 At that time it was said that information was still being collected
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya 5 maheenon ke baad bhi sarkaar ke paas is baat kaa jawaab nahin he ki aakhir mantriyon or vidhayakon ne kitni baar videsh yatraaen kii or in par kitna kharch aayaa
 On this whole matter, BJP MLA Om Prakash Sharma raised serious questions on the government
 unhone kaha sarkaar jaanboojh kar jaankaree chhipaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Meanwhile, your MLA Akhilesh Pati Tripathi held the officers responsible for this
 model toun se vidhayak ne kaha ki adhikari kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab sahi tareeke se dena hi nahin chaahate
 In the meantime, the question is not who has not given the answer, by the government or the officer
 jab logon ke tex ke paise par mantriyon or vidhayakon kii videsh yatraaen hoti hai, aise main logon ko is kharch kii jaankaree milani chaiye jisaki jimmedaari sarkaar kii banati he lekin philhal sarkaar is jaankaree ke chhipaane kaa prayaas karti hui najar aa rahi he
 Senior Congress MLA and former Minister Dr

 Dr

 He said that Madhya Pradesh ranks 6th in the country in terms of GDP
 unhone is sambandh main kisi bhi manch par pradesh ke mukhyamantri se bahes karne kii chunauti bhi di he

 The said letter is highlighting the backwardness of the state

 While the per capita income at the national level is Rs 43624, the per capita income in Madhya Pradesh is stable at Rs 27850 only
 sansad ke monsoon satr ke bich mangalvaar ko congress kii sansadeey dal kii baithak hui
 This was the first meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party after Rahul Gandhi became Congress President
 baithak ko sambodhit karte hue rahul gandhi ke nishane par pradhanmantri narendra modi rahe
 Rahul asked all his mps to prepare for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 rahul ne kaha ki bhrashtachar se jude sabhi maamalon par pradhanmantri chup hai, rafel ek bahut bada ghotaalaa he
 He said that we will continue our fight
 unhone kaha ki kisaan, rojgaar ke mudde par congress ke saansadon ne pichley chaar saalon main acchhee ladaai ladi he
 These years have been difficult for us
 ham aage bhi isi tarah sarkaar ko takkar denge, 2019 main congress jarur badi jeet hasil karegi
 Addressing the parliamentary party, Rahul emphasized three issues
 unhone rafel, kisaan or rojgaar ke mudde par modi sarkaar ko gherne ko kaha
 He said that the Prime Minister needs to speak, but he is sitting silently
 rojgaar ko lekar maaraa tha tanjagauratlab he kiraahul kii aakraamak bayaanbajike kaaran hi bijepi in dinon baikfoot par he
 Recently, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's statement on the backfoot on the issue like SC / ST Act and Maratha Reservation brought difficulties
 somvaar ko rahul gandhi ne bhi is mudde ko lekar kendriya mantri par tanj ksaa tha
 Actually, Gadkari had said that why do people want reservation when there are no jobs in the country
 is par rahul ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki gadakari ji, aapane bilkul sahi sawaal poocha he
 Every Indian is asking these questions
 aakhir naukariyaan kahaan hai? The powerful army of the country today expressed serious concern over the current political situation in the country, which was caused by the deadlock with the protesters of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government in Pakistan
 sena ke aalaa adhikariyon ke kor commander sammelan kaa aayojan rawalpindi main sainya mukhyalay main kiya gaya
 The meeting was chaired by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif
 sena ne loktantr ke liye samarthan jataayaa lekin kal raat hui hinsa ko lekar niraashaa bhi prakat kii
 Sena said, "expressing support for democracy, the meeting was reviewed with the current political situation and serious concern about its violent form, in which a large number of people were injured and some lost their lives
" ' sena ne aagaah kiya ki aage bhi balon kaa istemaal karne se samasya keval or badhegi
 Army officials, who have ruled Pakistan for more than half the time since 1947, said that the situation should be dealt with politically and not adopted violently without losing time
 imran khan or taahir ul kadri kii aguwai main pradhanmantri sharif ke khilaaf chal rahi muhim main tatasth bane rahane kaa prayaas karte hue sena ne kaha ki vah desh kii suraksha kii apni jimmedaari nibhaane ke liye patibaddh he or rashtriya aakankshaon ko puraa karne main kami nahin chhodeygi
 In the meeting held on Monday instead of Monday, the political leadership was given a clear message that the army is with democracy and the country, not with any person
 sena ne sanket diya he ki vah do kattar virodhiyon ke khilaaf ladaai ched rahe pradhanmantri sharif ke bachaav main dakhal nahin degi
 This statement does not support the Prime Minister's way of dealing with the political crisis and especially the use of force
 darasal bayaan main saavdhaanee purvak aisi niti kii baat kii gayi he jo halaat niyantran se baahar hone par sena ke hastkshep kaa vikalp khulaa chhodti he
 Nowadays the trend of giving great display in smartphones has increased

 samsung ne infinity disple ke saath judane ke liye Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+ smartphone ko lambey disple ke saath pesh kiya he
 The company's latest flagship Galaxy Note 8 has an aspect ratio and Infinity Display feature

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav aakhirkaar is baar bhi noida nahin aae
 Akhilesh is afraid of the same tricks, due to which all the Chief Ministers kept on coming to Noida earlier
 haalanki, is baar akhilesh ne vaada kiya ki agar 2017 main unki sarkaar banati he to wo noida jarur aaenge
 But how much the CM stays on his promise, only time will tell
 kyonki pichley maheene yani november main siem akhilesh yadav ne noida aane or tamaam pariyojnaon kaa shilanyas karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 On Wednesday, CM Akhilesh Yadav flagged off 11 projects including important projects of Noida, Greater Noida, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority and Noida Metro Rail Corporation Limited
 siem ne iske liye jagah chuni 5, kalidaas maarg, lakhanu yani mukhyamantri nivas
 Although there was doubt about whether CM will come to Noida to launch these projects from the beginning
 isaki vajah noida ko lekar siyaasi galiyare main maujuuda andhvishwaas tha
 However, on 2 December, CM Akhilesh, who came to attend the event in New Delhi, lashed out at Noida's question and said that he is going to visit Noida soon
 aise main ummid lagaai ja rahi thi ki siem in projects ko hari jhandi dikhaane noida hi aaenge
 At that time the event was proposed to be held on 11 December

 agast 2012: akhilesh yadav ne lakhanu se hi yamuna expresve kaa udghaatan kiya or noida nahin aae
 What is Noida's totality: In the political corridor of Uttar Pradesh, there is a belief that if the CM of the state visits Noida, he will soon be evicted from the chair
 yah totaka kareeb do dashakon se bhi zyada samay se chalata aa rahaa he
 Due to this trick, the Chief Minister of the state shies away from visiting Noida
 is apshakun kii shuruyaat 1988 main hui thi jab tatkaaleen siem vir bahadur singh ko noida daure ke kuch dinon ke bheetar satta ganvaani padi thi
 The same happened with ND Tiwari in 1989, Kalyan Singh in 1995 and 1999
 1995 main siem rahete mulaayam singh yadav noida gaye the or kuch maheene ke bheetar hi satta se bedakhal ho gaye
 The same happened with Ram Prakash Gupta in 1999
 1997 main mayawati bhi siem rahete noida gayi thi jiske baad wo satta se bedakhal ho gayi
 Mayawati once again dared to come to Noida and inaugurated the Dalit Prerna Sthal in October 2011 but her party was out of power in the elections held the following year

 On Friday, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Modi government has decided to take this casual purchase keeping in mind the emergency needs of the Indian Air Force
 cabinet mantriyon ke is bayaan ke baad is kharid prakriya se jude tamaam aise tathy saamne aae hai jo sthiti ko spasht karte hai
 Why Modi and Manmohan's Kirafel Deal is different? 1

 17 million euros
 is rate par prati fiter jet kii keemat 688
 30 crores comes
 yani yah daawa ki ek fiter plane kii keemat 1500 se 1700 karod rupee ke bich he puri tarah se galat he
 The entire deal is worth about Rs 750 crore less than the opening bid of France
 2
 In Europe, the Index for Daily Inflation (EIF) changes on a daily basis

 9 per cent
 lihaaja, rafel kii france dwaara hone vaali supplai main baad main deliver hone vaale fiter jet kii keemat ek nishchit keemat se adhik nahin honge
 On the other hand, since the supply of the first fighter plane in the deal during the Congress tenure, this index of inflation would have affected the cost of fighter jets and the later delivered fighter jets would have been unexpectedly expensive
 3
 The fighter jet will be supplied by the Modi government keeping in mind the 13 special needs of the Indian Air Force in the Huirafel deal
 is tarah kii koi suvidha upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main hui deal main nahin thi
 This includes significant improvements to the radar system that will help these fighter jets to identify the enemy

 Union Sports Minister (independent Charge) Ajay Maken on Wednesday said that by suspending IPL players who were found to be involved in spot-fixing, the Indian Cricket Board cannot get rid of itself, it will have to get to the bottom of the problem
 maakan ne yah bhi kaha ki bisisiai ko khud ko ipel se dur kar lenaa chahie
 Maken said, "BCCI will have to go to the root of this problem
 khilaadiyon ke nilamban bhar se baat nahin banegi
 The ICC has recognized BCCI as the apex body of cricket in India
 aise main bisisiai kii jimmedaari banati he ki vah is maamle ko jald sulajhaaye
 Maken said that the BCCI should separate itself from the IPL and allow it to continue as an independent entity

 Maken said that now is the right time, when the BCCI should give up its insistence on not coming within the limits of the Right to Information (RTI)
 sabhi khel mahasang iske daayre main hai, bisisiai ko ise maan lenaa chahie
 It is noteworthy that the latest spot-fixing case has raised questions on the credibility of the IPL

 25 november ko aarushi-hemraj murder cese par faisla aana he
 Everyone is desperate to know who is the killer of aarushi-hemraj
 haal ke vakt kaa ye shaayad pehla aisa cese he, jiskaa faisla puri tarah sirf or sirf suni-sunai kahani or paristhitijanya sabooton ko saamne rakh kar sunaaya janaa he
 Till date, no direct witness has been revealed in this double murder, there is no concrete evidence, nor is there any mass murder nor any concrete evidence to prove the cause of the murder
 ab aise main sibiai vakil kii daleelon, scientific saboot or sirf halaat ko saamne rakh kar kaatil kaa faisla karnaa he
 Apparently, as a murderer, the CBI has not put anyone else but Aarushi's parents i
e
 Dr
 Rajesh and Dr
 Nupur Talwar in the dock and the whole story of the plot revolves around these two
 in donon ko gherne kii vajah bhi bataai gai
 The reason is that when Aarushi and Hemraj were killed on the night of 15-16 May 2008, there were only four people inside the house
 doctor rajesh talwaar, doctor nupur talwaar, aarushi or hemraj
 The whole story of the CBI says that no one went inside the house that night and no one came from outside
 yani katl ghar ke andar hi hua or kaatil ghar main hi tha
 About this story, the CBI kept all its arguments and scientific evidence in the court
 haalanki aapako bataa den ki ye vahi sibiai he jisane disambar 2010 main is cese ko hi band kar dene kii sifarish kii thi
 The CBI had then filed a closure report in the court, arguing that there was no doubt about Dr Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar but there was no evidence against them, but then in February 2011, the court dismissed the closure report
 Closure was ordered to turn the reporter into a charge sheet
 iske baad 25 may 2012 ko talwaar dampatti ke khilaaf aarope patr tay kiya gaya or unhen aaropee bana kar mudakadame kii karrwai shuru hui
 The trial proceeded for about one and a half years
 sibiai ke vakil ek taraf talwaar dampatti ko kaatil tehra rahe hai, vahiin duusari taraf khud kuch sawaalon ko lekar uljhan main he
 In response to these questions, the CBI presented all the arguments before the court but no evidence
 ye tamaam saboot yaa daleelein sibiai kii taraf se adaalat main rakhi gai hai:saboot number 1doctor rajesh talwaar or nupur talwaar har raat aarushi kaa cameraa baahar selock kar chaabi apane paas takie ke neeche rakhte the,jabaki 16 may ko chaabi dopaher kareeb baarah baje lobby main padaa mila
 The Talwar couple could not answer how the key reached there
 saboot number-2mauka-e-vaardaat par har cheez saaf kar di gai thi
 Aarushi's corpse was covered with a sheet and sprinkles blood splatter everywhere
 ye kaam sirf ghar ke log hi kar sakate hai
 Proof number -316: On receiving the news of Aarushi's murder on the morning of May, as soon as the police reached the house, the people sent them out to search Hemraj to divert the attention of the police
 saboot number 4chat ke daravaaje or kundi par khun ke nishaan dikhaae jane ke baad bhi doctor talwaar ne chat kii chaabi dene se inkaar kar diya
 After proof No
5 Hemraj's body was found on the roof, Doctor Talwar refused to identify him
 saboot number-6postmortem report or exiaar main balaatkaar ke bare main zikr naa karne ke liye doctor dinesh talwaar ne guzarish kii
 According to the statement and call details of former police officer KK Gautam, proof number 7, Hemraj's body was not found on the roof by chance, but was specially sent there to find the body
 saboot number-8golf stick jiske bare main shaq tha ki katl usee se kiya gaya he orjo vaardaat ke baad se ghar se gaayab tha,uske milane ke baad bhi doctor talwaar ne salbhar tak kisi ko isaki ittila nahin di
 Proof No
 9 The evidence and circumstances were saying that the murder was caused by the golf stick and the murderer suddenly used it in anger and that the golf stick doctor used the sword
 saboot number-10postmortem se ain pehle doctor rajesh talwaar ke bhai doctor dinesh talwaar ne apane ek saathi doctor sunil dohare se khud ko ames ke foresanki department kaa had doctor dogra ban kar kisi ko phone karne ko kaha tha
 This proves that it was done so that the post-mortem report can be made according to its own
 ab dekhnaa yahi he ki dephence kii tarah hi adaalat sibiai kii in daleelon ko bi maanati he yaa nakaarti he

 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne twit kar aaj bataaya he ki narendra modi ke bihar main duusare charan ke prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat teen march se hogi
 Later Sushil Kumar Modi confirmed the receipt of the program related to Narendra Modi's arrival in Muzaffarpur district
 uttar bihar ke pramukh shahar mujffarpur main yojit hone vaali narendra modi kii yah raily patna ke gandhi maidan main pichley saal 27 aktubar ko yojit hunkaar raily ke baad duusari raily hogi

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JDU, which raised questions about Narendra Modi's secularism, parted ways with the BJP in June last year when he was made the head of the election campaign committee
 aam aadmi party in dinon maafeename ke daur se guzar rahi he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who has been strictly targeting opponents at election rallies from Delhi to Punjab, seems to be softening these days
 raajnneeti main aane ke baad aam aadmi party ke kai netaa manahani ke mukademon se jujh rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal has written a written apology to former Punjab Minister Bikram Majithia, current Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and Amit Sibal
 is faisle se party ke andruni netaaon se lekar bahari log bhi hairaan hai
 Last year too, Arvind Kejriwal apologized to former BJP MP Avtar Singh Bhadana
 unhone yahaan tak kaha tha ki apane sahyogi ke bahekaave main aakar galat aarope lagaae
 Now will Kejriwal apologize to them? - In 2013, Sheila Dixit's political secretary Pawan Kheda had made a case against Kejriwal
 tab unhone televijan sho or pradarshan ke dauraan shila par abhadra tippanee kii thi
 Arun Jaitley has made 2 defamation cases against Kejriwal
 pehla, didisie main bhrashtachar ke aarope par 10 karod rupye kaa mukadmaa, doosraa mukhyamantri daftar par chaape ke maamle main jetali kaa naam ghaseetne par mukadmaa
 In 2013, Surendra Kumar Sharma had a case against him
 ‘aap’ kaa tikat naa dene or apane khilaaf abhadra tippanee ke aarope main surendra ne kejariwal par manahani kaa cese kiya tha
 - In 2016, BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri filed a defamation case against Kejriwal for making baseless allegations against him
 - 2016 main chetan chouhan ne didisie maamle apane khilaaf abhadra tippanee ke baad kejariwal par manahani kaa cese kiya
 Is this the real reason for the apology? 1
 sanghathan kii chintayah siem kejariwal kii khaas ranneeti ho sakati he
 The leadership has decided that the defamation cases against all the leaders should be abolished as soon as possible
 iske liye maafee bhi maangani pade, to bhi ve taiyaar hai
 Aam Aadmi leaders are unable to pay attention to the expansion of the party due to defamation lawsuits
 kai rajyon main sanghathan badhanaa he
 Lok Sabha elections are to be held next year in 2019
 2
 In the event of the party not being able to produce sufficient evidence in cases of defamation, it will have to pay heavy damages or go to jail
 aam aadmi party nservind kejarivalko hi desh bhar main cheharaa banaaya he or aise main jab manahani cese kii musiibat main khud arvind kejariwal funs jaaen to lagaataar tut rahi party kaa bhavishya khatre main pad saktaa he
 3
 fund kii kamiek sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki kya ‘aap’ ko chanda aana bhi kam ho chukaa he yaa party ke paas manahani ke mukademen ladane ke liye paryaapt rakam nahin he
 In a court case, lawyers charge their own fees
 tarikhon kii vajah se samay ke saath paisa bhi nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Obviously, the 2019 election campaign will require money

 Therefore, the committee suggested that such a system should be put in place so that the food items supplied to the paramilitary forces should be tested at the source and their nutritional value, hygiene, how much is right for consumption etc
 By labeling that the goods are tested and certified
 cameti ne suzav diya ki ardhsainik bal iske liye ordinance kaarkaanon or diardio kii madad le sakate hai

 There is a lot of resentment among the soldiers and officers about promotion in BSF

 In the film, an area called North Bangistan is described which matches North Pakistan

 The name of the film should not be objected to by Pakistan in Bangladesh as Bangladesh may also be similar to Afghanistan
 north bangistan north afghanistan se bhi mail khaataa he , isliye naam ke aadhaar par pakistan kaa film par aitaraaz sahi nahin he

 I’m Shocked as to how they have missed the message in # Bangistan North Bangladesh also matches North Afghanistan, so Pakistan's objection to the film based on the name is not correct

 In such a situation, take a look at the disputed points related to the post-mortem report of Sunanda
 
 
 1
 The mystery about Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report has deepened
 sutron ke mutabik, sunanda ke sharir main na to kisi jehar, na hi kisi depressant kii dawa ke saboot mili hai
 2
 pehle kii postmortem report main bataaya gaya he ki sunanda kii maut dawa kii vajah se hui thi or alprex naam kii dawa ke saboot mili the
 The viscera report came in March 2014
 nae khulaase se postmortem ko lekar shaq paidaa hona swaabhaavik he
 3
 is nae khulaase se jaanch adhikari bhi sakate main hai, jinhone sunanda ke hotel ke kamare se alprex kii kareeb-kareeb khaali strip mili thi
 If the viscera report is true, it would be presumed that Sunanda had taken the right dose of medicine and that the empty strip of Elprax was kept to mislead the authorities
 4
 Police had recovered two strips of Alprax from Sunanda's room
 ek strip main 15 goliyaan hoti hai
 One strip was completely empty and the other three bullets were left
 5
 Now the big question that has arisen is that if Sananda was taking pills according to the dosage, then how did the empty strip get? 6
 postmortem report main yah bhi likhaa he ki sunanda ke sharir par jakhm ke 15 nishaan the
 7
 sunanda ke sharir par zyaadaatar jakhmon ke nishaan behad saamaanya kism ke the, jisase maut nahin ho sakati
 8
 jakhm kaa nishaan number-12 daant kaatane kaa tha
 9
 nishaan number-10 injection kaa tha
 10
 ames ke forensik vibhaag ke head sudhir gupta ne likhaa he ki postmortem ke vakt sharir se badboodaar gas kii mahak aa rahi thi

 Mother's courage and facial yoga did wonders
 
 
 ruchika to is durghatana ke baad puri tarah aatmasamarpan kar chuki thim lekin unki maa ne himmat nahin haari
 His mother would tell him inspiring stories
 meditation or aadhyatm se jodne kii koshish karatin
 He had to undergo several operations to recover from the road accident
 yahaan tak kii paanv main scru bheeimplantkarwaanaa padaa
 Ruchika resorted to facial yoga during this time
 yoga se unhen khub madad mili or chehre kii khoi raunak phir se lautne lagi
 Tried to fulfill the childhood dream again
 
 
 ruchika bachapan se hi model bananaa chaahati thim lekin jaisaa ki bharat kii adhikansh aam janata ke saath hota rahaa he, unhone bhi apane sapanom se samjhaute kar liye
 Such dreams could not be fulfilled, but after this rise, she was determined that after emerging from the accident, she will take part in the beauty pageant
 ek din wo yun hi internet browj kar rahi thim ki unhen 'misses india' ke bare main pataa chalaa
 He immediately applied for it
 vah select bhi ho gayi
 Here she could not win the biggest title in this competition but due to her skill and passion and beauty, she was awarded the title of Mrs

 Not only this, Ruchika also did wonders in facial yoga
 haadase ke baad vahfacial yogaase ubareen or duusare logon ko facial yoga sikhaane kaa jimmaa uthaaya
 In one of his classes, 1961 people were involved and for this reason his name is also recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records
 saath hi ruchika bataati hai ki yoga-dhyaan to bharat kii paidaaish hai lekin iskaa adhikansh patent va record duusare deshon ke naam par he
 Ruchika has given India another chance to be proud of this record
 aise tamaam logon ke liye unka saxem mantra he 'nevar give ap'
 Now we will just pray to God that Ruchika just keep moving forward like this

 So much has happened in this World Cup that is surprising the football enthusiasts
 diggaj khilaadi, diggaj timen sabhi world cap ko alavida kah chuki hai
 Even though stars like messi-ronaldo have been eliminated in the World Cup, but Neymar of Brazil remains spellbound
 somvaar ko mexico ke khilaaf nemaar apane rang main dikhe
 Thanks to Neymar's goal, Brazil beat Mexico 2–0 and made it to the quarter-finals
 paanch baar worldcup jeet chuki brazil ab is saal kaa khitaab jeetne ke or kareeb aa gai he
 Neymar scored the first goal in the 51st minute, while substitute Roberto Fermino doubled Brazil's lead in the 88th minute
 agar mexico ke golkeeper gulermo ochoa ne kuch achche bachaav nahin kiye hote, to brazil kii jeet kaa antar isse adhik hota
 No one like Neymar
 
 !! With the goal scored on Monday, Neymar's goals have reached number 6 in the World Cup
 nemaar ne ye gol sabase kam shots main maare, unhone ye lakshya sirf 23 shot main hasil kiya
 In addition Lionel Messi required 67 shots to score 6 goals, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored 6 goals in 74 shots
 brazil kii ore se nemaar ne ab tak 89 maichon main 57 gol daage hai
 In this World Cup, Neymar is No
 1 overall shot - 23 shots on target - 12 total chances scored - 16 total fouls - 23 How many goals in the World Cup - Messi - 6 Neymar - 6 Ronaldo - 7 The record for most goals in the World Cup is now named after Brazil
 mexico ke khilaaf match main brazil ne do gol daage or apane golon kii kul sankhya 228 kar lee
 Germany have 226 goals in the World Cup
 228 gol: brazil226 gol : germany137 gol : argentina128 gol: italy113 gol: francebrazil ne lagaataar saatvin baar (kul 16veen baar) quarter final main jagah banaai, jabaki mexico lagaataar saatvin baar antim-16 se aage badhane main naakaam rahaa
 If club and country are combined, Neymar has scored 15 goals in the last 16 matches
 yani agar strike rate ko tavajjo den to nemaar yahaan bhi hit hai
 When the family grows up, it becomes a clan and mutual love decreases
 ek duusare ke peeche khadey hone kaa jazbaa kam ho jaataa he
 Everyone starts demanding their rights
 aisa hi kuch bijepi ke saath ho rahaa he
 The party, which likes to call itself a family, does not look the same, nor has its mannerisms remained
 band kamaron main ummidavaaron kaa faisla, dal badaluon kaa swaagat, karmath kaaryakartaaon kii upeksha, varisht sadasyon par dabaav daalkar apni baat manvaanaa, maukaparasti vagairah vah sab kuch he jo pehle kam dikhataa tha
 There was a time that BJP candidates knew a long time ago where they had to contest elections, but this time the picture is not clear till the last moment
 party congress ko dal badaluon ko apane paale main laane par khinchaai karti thi, lekin aaj dalbadaluon kii qatari lagi hui hisit jeetne ke liye varisht netaaon kii maukaparasti apana chunaav kshetra chhodkar surakshit jagah jane main saaf dikhaai de rahi he
 The arrogance of many leaders is becoming bigger than the Himalayas
 party ke kam haisiyat ke netaa haashiye par hai
 He has no hearing
 matlab yah he ki party kaa purana swaroop badal gaya he
 The BJP is no longer the party that was once known for its idealized words and behavior
 zyada se zyada siten jeetne ke lobh main party ne apana charitra hi badal diya he
 There are so many changes in it that it seems that in a few days it will become like the old Congress, whose sole purpose was to get power under any circumstances and manipulation was normal for him
 aap kah sakate hai ki badalte vakt ke saath badalanaa manushya kii fitrat he or koi bhi party aakhir isse kab tak bachi rah sakati he
 The BJP has also changed
 jab desh kaa charitra badalata he to partiyaan kaise waisi kii waisi rah sakati hai ? apni tamaam adarshavaadi baton ke baavjood bijepi aaj vahaan khadi he jahaan use nahin hona chahie tha, lekin satta kaa aakarshan bada ghaatak hota he
 It is difficult to avoid this, so the party has also changed and has started following the same path on which Congress has been following for so many years
 aage kya hoga, kahana mushkil he
 But it is so certain that this path does not go very long

 narendra modi sarkaar 2
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first budget of 0 in the Lok Sabha on Friday
 bajet bhaashan main unhone blue iconomi kaa zikr kiya
 He said that this time Modi government will emphasize on it to increase the country's economy
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bharat ke kul vyapaar kaa takreeban 90 fisadi hissaa samudri maarg se hi hota he
 In such a situation, the Blue Economy is not only strategic for India but also very economically beneficial
 aaie jaanate hai, aakhir kya he blue iconomi or kaise milegaa desh ko iskaa phayda
 - The concept of blue economy first gained importance in Gunter Pauly's book 'the Blue Economy: 10 years, 100 innovations, 100 million jobs' in 2010
 jisamen nimnlikhit baaten thi
 - Under the Blue Economy, the economy is based on the maritime sector
 jisamen paryaavaran kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dynemic bijness model taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Through 'blue Growth', the problem of lack of resources and disposal of waste is attempted
 - isamen tikaoo vikaas ko bhi sunishchit kiya jaataa he taaki bade paimaane par maanav kalyaan kii ore dhyaan diya jaae
 - Under the blue economy, the sea will also be kept clean so that there is mass production from the sea
 - is vakt blue iconomi ke tahat mukhya focus khanij padaarthon samet samudri utpaadon par he
 - The concept of the Blue Economy is much broader and includes maritime activities
 - blue iconomi kaa dhaancha paryaavaran ke anukool he kyonki bade-bade cargo saamaan samudri kshetra main ek jagah se duusari jagah le jaae ja sakate hai or vah bhi trakon yaa railway kii madad ke bina
 Under this agenda, an environmentally friendly infrastructure will have to be built at sea
 - vahiin aise main kuch infrastakchar ko samudr kii ore shift karnaa acchhee aarthik or raajnneetik ranneeti he
 It is also possible in India
 - aapako bataa den, niti ayog ne desh kii iconomi ko nai disha dene kaa kaam kiya he
 Under this scheme, the country has to stand as a 'blue Economy', using the fast growing economy and long maritime boundaries
 - bharat ke kul vyapaar kaa 90 fisadi samudri maarg se hi hota he
 In such a situation, exploiting the blue economy is beneficial for India from a strategic perspective
