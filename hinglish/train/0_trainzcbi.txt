 -input IANS RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav has once again targeted Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's ongoing developmental review journey and alleged that the journey cost Rs 10 crore a day, which in itself is a major scam
 lalu ne kaha ki mukhyamantri rojaanaa ek jile kaa daura karte hai or vahaan par vikaas kaaryon kii samiksha tathaa logon se milane ke baad jansabha ko sambodhit karte hai or in sab main rojaanaa 10 karod rupye kaa kharch ho rahaa he
 Lalu alleged that Nitish Kumar is not getting public support in the Vikas Samhita Yatra and due to this, the government is now forcibly pulling people from far and wide to his public meeting
 shuukravaar ko apane awaas par ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue lalu ne kuch kagajaat dikhaae or kaha kirajya sarkaaraki ore se sabhi jiladhikariyon ko ek patr bheja gaya gaya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki unhen mukhyamantri kii har jansabhaon ke liye kam se kam 4000 mahilaon ko lekar aana he
 Lalu said that the Chief Minister's Yatra has now become a "vikas Samiksha Yatra" but not a "vikas Review Yatra Scam"
 sarkari farmaan ke anusaaranithish kumaarake ek jansabha main jo bhi mahilaayein aati he un par ₹75 kaa kharch sarkaar karti he
 The state government arranges for breakfast, food, water and medicines for all the women coming to the meeting
 lalu ne yah bhi sawaal uthaaya kii mukhyamantri kii vikaas samiksha yatra ek sarkari kaarykram he magar iske baavjood bhi unki jansabhaon main jediu ke jhande lage rahete hai, aakhir aisa kyon he ? lalu ne maang kii ki jansabhaon main mahilaon ko laane ke liye jitne bhi bason kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he or dawaaiyon ke liye paisa kharch kiya jaataa he in sab kii jaanch honi chahie
 On the other hand, speaking on the results of exit polls on Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, Lalu said that the estimates of all exit polls will prove to be wrong and Congress will form government on December 18 in both these states
 lalu ne yah bhi aarope laga diya ki desh BJP ke haathon main biki hui he

 balasaheb kaa vivaah minaa thakare se hua tha
 They had three sons - Bindumadhav, Jaidev and Uddhav Thackeray

 Bal Thackeray used to bring out a newspaper named Saamna in Marathi language
 is akhbaar ke madhyam se ve apane man kii baat logon tak pahunchaaya karte the
 He wrote in his editorial a few days before his death- "nowadays my condition is worrying but the condition of my country is more worrying than me; how can i sit silent in such a situation?" Thakrethakare, a cartoonist, made his career as a cartoonist

 When the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) successfully launched its second moon mission Chandrayaan-2 on 22 July, there were congratulations from various sections of the whole world
 puri sthit govardhan math ke shankaracharya nishchalanand saraswati ji ne bhi isro ke vaigyanikon kaa abhinandan kiya
 There are reports in the media that ISRO scientists consulted Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati to overcome the problems in the launch of Chandrayaan-2
 shankaracharya nishchalanand saraswati kii salaah par vaigyanikon ne vaidic ganit se apni samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya
 According to the media reports, ISRO scientists consulted Swami Nischalananda Saraswati in July before the launch of Chandrayaan-2
 aisa kuch sandehon ko dur karne ke liye kiya gaya tha jiskaa samaadhaan us samay vaigyanikon ke paas bhi nahin tha
 According to Shankaracharya, the Vishnu Purana and the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita (shrimad Bhagwat Geeta) have an important relationship with water and earth from the moon
 mahabharat (atharah pustakon main se chhathi) bhishma parv ke anusaar chandramaa kaa vyas 11,000 yojan (1 yojan = lagbhag 12
 2 km)
 isaki paridhi 33,000 yojan he
 Accordingly, the diameter of the moon becomes - 134,200 km and the circumference is 402,600 km
 jabaki aap internet par chand kaa vyas khojenge to jawaab milegaa 3,474
 2 km and circumference 10,921 km
 yahaan ganit samajhnaa mushkil he
 But you should know whether ISRO scientist went to Swami Nischalananda to solve the problem
 nahin
 
 
 The ISRO did not go to scientist Swami Nischalananda
 IN ne puri sthit govardhan math ke ucch padasth sutron se is bare main poocha to sach kaa khulaasa hua
 Sources said that scientists come to meet Maharaj
 lekin, chandrayan-2 ko lekar isro se koi vaigyanik nahin aae
 It is different that two years ago there was a lecture by Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati in the Ahmedabad center of ISRO
 isamen unhone vaidic ganit ke mahatv ko samajhaayaa tha
 Swami ji had told how only the eternal Vedic Arya doctrine can take today's science further
 iske liye jaruri he vaidic ganit
 With the help of Vedic mathematics, ISRO scientists can make their mission successful by assessing the country, time and object
 yahaan swami nishchalanand ji ne kaha tha ki aaj ham dheron yantra bana rahe hai, lekin sabase utkrisht yantra vahi hota he jisamen medha shakti, pragna shakti, praan shakti ho
 But till now such a machine has not been made human
 maanav ke jivan kii anukriti hi sarvshereshth yantra hoga
 But for this it is necessary that the help of Vedas should be taken in science
 bina vaidic ganit ke vigyaan adhuraa he
 Vedic science is a source of poverty
 lekin duniya bhar ke vaigyanik aaj isi vigyaan ko samruddhi bataa rahe hai
 Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati is a scholar of Vedic mathematics
 unhone vaidic ganit par 11 kitaaben bhi likhi hai
 Apart from this, he also goes to lecture on the importance of Vedic mathematics in institutions like BARC, IIT and ISRO

 But if he resigns, he will not get any post-retirement facility

 After which the person appealed for anticipatory bail in front of Nejaj Ravindra Reddy

 In the complaint, he said that the case was heard on 5 December and was granted on the same day
 shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki mere anusarmetropolitian seshanjaj sunwaayee ke agle din hi apana faisla suna saktaa he
 But the judge ruled the same day
 jiske aadhaar par maine kaha ki ye maamla kaaphi gambhir he
 He said in the complaint that it seemed that he was in a hurry to give Bell's verdict
 isi aadhaar par unhone shikaayat kii thi, or jaanch kii maang kii thi
 Let me tell you that in the last few months only three judges of lower court have been arrested in Hyderabad
 abhi ye jaj bhrashtachar ke aarope ke baad nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 Significantly, after the decision, the way the judge resigned, there were frequent political comments

 narmada bachaao andolan ne prabhavit gaanvon kii sankhya 178 bataai, jise ab rajya sarkaar ne maan liya he
 But the big question is, when will they get relief in rising water level and decreasing time? bharat main janme arbapati udhyami or paropkaaree manoj bhargav kaa yah maananaa he ki jinke paas bhi dhan-sampada he, unka yah kartavya he ki aise logon kii seva karen jinke paas dhan nahin he
 It is for this that he has started the Billions in Change movement, which aims to make useful inventions for the ill-fated half of the world's population that can improve the quality of life of billions of people
 unhone apni sampatti kaa 99 fisadi se zyada samaaj ke is varg ke jeevanaster main sudhaar ke liye lagane kaa vachan diya he or iske liye vah aise avishkaron ke vikaas or niyojan main aarthik sahyog karenge jinase logon ko apni buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa karne main madad mil sake
 This particular attitude towards Bhargava's well-being was first reflected in the 2015 documentary film Billions in Change, which featured four solutions devised by Stage-2, Bhargava's Farmington Hills, Michigan (USA) invention shop, Energy, water and health are linked
 bhargav ne kaha, ‘prakaash, saaf jal or paushtik bhojan hi swasthya, shiksha or jeevika kii buniyaad hai
 He said, 'without them it is impossible to live a productive life and take care of your family
 ’billians in change 2 is tarah kii ai pehali documentry kii agali kadi he or isamen puri tarah se nae paanch avishkaron kii jaankaree di gai he jo ki ukt buniyadi jaruraton kaa sidhaa samaadhaan karte hai
 Here we take a look at the five solutions shown in the documentary, which have been field tested and are likely to change the lives of people using them
 aaie ham aapako bataate hai koun se hai ye paanch nae avishkaar :1
 The lack of reliable access to electricity has been overcome
 The HANS tm powerpack - The Swan Power Pack is a lightweight portable device that allows one to easily generate electricity for basic use such as lights, fans and mobile devices, etc
 and Can store it
 isamen ek spot lite or room liting, ek yuasabi port or chote electronics ko chalaane ke liye 12 volt kaa outlet shaamil he
 It can also be recharged free of charge with the built-in solar panel, the HANS tm Solar Briefcase or the HANS tm Free Electric bike
 ise kisi regular wal socket kii madad se bijli se bhi charge kiya ja saktaa he
 In places where there is electricity for 2 to 3 hours daily, the goose power pack can be charged during this time and can be used later during power cuts
 da hans power pack kaa nirmaan usee padaarth se kiya gaya he, jisase bulatopruf shishe kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he or isamen 12 saal kii varantee bhi di jaati he, jisase yah kaaphi lambey samay tak chalata he

 saura urja ab sabaki pahunch mentanshtm Solar Briefcase-hans solar brifces ek halkaa, portable or istemaal karne main aasaan solar panels kaa set he jiske dwaara duniya main kahin bhi hans power pack kaa istepamaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The Hans Solar Briefcase, designed with portability and durability in mind, can overcome a number of serious problems that make glass rooftop panels impractical for solar power
 hans power pack or hans solar brifces saath milakar ek aise mini power stesan jaise ho jate hai, jinamein na to kisi tarah ke eendhan kharidne kii jarurat padati he or na hi pradooshan hota he
 They solve a problem that is troubling nearly 3 billion people in the world: not having reliable access to electricity

 in aatmahatyaon kii vajah kisaanon ke upar karj, fasalon kii keemat nahin milanaa or sookhaa rahaa
 But the Rajasthan government is not ready to consider the deaths of these farmers as suicide to save its image

 In this time, you celebrate the anniversary of Salman Khan with a hobby
 par apni qadro-tarif or keemtee vaqt kaa ek hissaa us mastamaula shaayar ke naam bhi reserve rakhie, jo bilashak isduniya kaa sabase azeem shairatha
 The one who used to make ghazals standing and read that there were earthquakes in the mahfils
 jisane shaayad is duniya ke sabase muqammal or yaad rah jane vaale sher kahe
 One of which was, 'yeh Ishq Nahin Aasan, just understand this / Ik is a river of fire and have to drown
 'aapaki jindagi main 'ishq' yaa 'lafzon' kii thodi bhi qadra hogi to aapkogalib zarur yaad honge
 Today is the anniversary of Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, who lives in Old Delhi
 aaie aapako unki yaadon main le chalate hai
 The Maqbool Ghazalay became like this when Bahadur Shah Zafar was the ruler of India
 zuk unke darbar main shahi kavi the
 Till then Mirza Ghalib's discussions were in every street of Delhi
 badshaah salaamat unhen sunanaa pasand karte the lekin zuk ko shahi kavi hone ke naate alag rutaba hasil tha
 It is said that for this reason there was a figure of 36 in Zouk and Ghalib
 ek din gaalib bazaar main baithe jua khel rahe the tabhi vahi se zuk kaa kaafila niklaa
 Ghalib taunted and said, 'it is Shah's grudge, it is a fall
 ' is par zuk aag babula ho uthe par unhone apni palki se utarkar gaalib ke munh laganaa thik na samajha
 He complained to King Salamat
 badshaah ne gaalib ko darbar main pesh hone ko kaha
 Well, Galib attended
 darbar main saare shahi darbari maujuud the
 The Emperor asked Ghalib if Mian Zouk's complaint was justified? Ghalib cleverly said that what Zouk heard is the place of his new Ghazal
 is par badshaah salaamat ne gaalib ko lage-haath puri ghazal pesh karne kaa hukum de daalaa
 Then what was left
 gaalib ne apni jeb se ek kagaz kaa tukdaa nikaala, use kuch pal tak ghuraa, or uske baad nikali ye kaaljayi ghazal:har ek baat pe kehete ho tum ki tu kya haitumhiin kaho ki ye andaaze-guftagu kya hain sholay main ye karishma, na barq main ye adaakoi bataao ki wo shokhe-tund-ku kya hevidio main dekhie najeeb jang ko gaalib par baat karte hue RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that in a recent meeting with senior BJP leader LK Advani, he did not give him any "instruction" to step down from the post of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 nahin diya gaya koi nirdeshadwani pehle hi media kii in khabaron kaa khandan kar chuke hai ki bhagwat ne unase mulaakaat ke dauraan apana uttaradhikari manonith karne ko kaha
 This is the first comment of Bhagwat after his explanation
 bhagwat ne kaha ‘‘main adwani se mila
 We discussed many things, but i did not issue any instructions that day
 ’’ aresas pramukh ne kaha ki bijepi se aresas kaa ‘kuch lenaa-dena’ nahin he
 The BJP itself was capable of taking decisions, he said, "BJP is a separate organization and we do not influence it at any level

 After Bhagwat's recent lunch with Advani, there were reports that the RSS chief had asked him to nominate his successor in the near future

 On September 4, Chandrayaan will be in the nearest orbit, on September 7, the soft landing on the lunar surface will be made by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on the evening of September 1
 21 baje chandrayan ko chandramaa kii paanchavin kaksha main daalaa
 Right now Chandrayaan-2 is circling around the moon in 119 km apogee (the shortest distance from the moon) and 127 km perigee (the longest distance from the moon)
 aaj yani 2 sitambar ko vikram lander, chandrayan-2 ke orbitor se alag ho jayega
 12 noon 45 se 13
 Between 45 ISRO scientists will carry out this work
 chandrayan-2 ke orbitor se alag hone ke baad bhi kareeb 20 ghante tak vikram lander orbitor ke peeche-peeche usee kaksha main chakkar lagaataa rahegaa
 Let us tell you that Chandrayaan-2 is made up of three parts - first- orbiter, second- Vikram Lander and third- Pragyan Rover
 vikram lander ke andar hi pragyan rover he, jo soft landing ke baad baahar nikalegaa
 On September 3, the first deorbit ie Vikram Lander will change its class on September 3 at 9 am
 00 se 10
 Between 00 o'clock, Vikram Lander will leave the orbiter of Chandrayaan-2 and go to the new class
 is orbit main daalane ke liye isro vaigyanik kareeb 3 second ke liye uskaa ingine on karenge
 The Vikram Lander will then revolve around the moon in an elliptical orbit at 109 km apogee and 120 km perigee
 4 sitambar ko chand ke chaaron taraf vikram duusari baar badalegaa apni kakshaisero vaigyanik vikram lander ko 4 sitambar ko chand ke sabase najdiki kaksha main pahunchaayenge
 The Apogee of this class will be 36 km and Periji 110 km
 agle teen dinon tak vikram lander isi andakaar kaksha main chand kaa chakkar lagaataa rahegaa
 During this, ISRO scientists Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover will continue to investigate the health
 7 sitambar hoga sabase chunauteepurn, chand par utrega vikram lander1:30 baje raat (6 or 7 sitambar kii darmyaani raat) -vikram lander 35 kimi kii oonchai se chand ke dakshini dhruv par utarana shuru karegaa
 This will be a very challenging task for ISRO scientists
 1:55 baje raat -vikram lander dakshini dhruv par maujuud do cretar mengines-si or simpelius-en ke bich maujuud maidan main utrega
 The lander will land on the lunar surface at a speed of 2 meters per second
 ye 15 minute behad tanaavpurn honge

 At the same time, the main opposition party Samajwadi Party also elected its leader in the assembly
 lekin, mahaj 7 siten jeetne vaali congress upi main ab tak apana netaa nahin chun pai he
 In fact, out of the 7 Congress mlas in UP, there are 2 such mlas who have reached the assembly for the second time
 unamem ek hai kushinagar se ajay singh lallu or duusari hai rajyasabha saansad pramod tiwari kii beti aradhana tiwari
 If sources are to be believed, the remaining five mlas are in favor of making Aradhana the leader of the legislature party, while Rahul Gandhi's choice is Ajay Singh Lallu of low-profile and rural environment
 yaheen par aakar pench fansaa hua he
 Rahul has also met all the mlas for a round and has searched everyone's mind
 lekin wo ab tak faisla nahin kar paae hai
 Sources also say that, if Rahul imposes his choice and ignores the numbers, the fear is that the remaining mlas may not leave the party
 aakhir upi or uttarakhand main party chhod kar jane vaale netaaon kii lambii fehrist he
 In such a situation, Rahul does not want to hurry on the advice of senior leaders
 darasal, party ke netaaon kaa ek tabaka hameshaa se pramod tiwari par iljaam lagaataa rahaa he ki, lambey arase tak pramod congress vidhayak dal ke netaa rahete hue sattadhari dal se kareebi rakhte rahe or sirf khud ko majboot karte rahe party ko nahin
 However, Pramod Tiwarisonia Gandhi, who has a record of winning consecutive elections, has repeatedly explained this to Gandhi, when he got the party's mark to become a Rajya Sabha MP
 ab pramod virdohi netaa rahul ko samajhane main jute hai ki, aradhana ko netaa bananaa ek baar phir pramod ke haathon main kaman saunpane jaisaa hoga
 However, Pramod supporters argue that, her daughter has a different personality, she is well-educated and well-spoken and all mlas except one are with her
 duusari taraf,pramod tiwariab bataur rajyasabha saansad centre kii raajnneeti hi karnaa chaahate hai or pradesh kii chunavi raajnneeti se duuri banane ke mood main hai
 In such a situation, what is the harm in making Aradhana the leader of the Legislative Party in the Legislative Assembly
 kul milakar khastahal party main is mudde par pench fansaa hua he
 Now the question is, now Rahul imposes his choice or accept the views of the mlas or else a third bet is scored in the event of finding a middle ground
 lekin ek taraf khastahal party ko dobaaraa khadaa karne kii chunauti se nipatane ke liye koshish shuru karne kii bajaay party chote-chote faisle karne main itani deree kar rahi he

 It has also been said in the recommendation that the government can recover this amount from Inspector DN Raj if he wants

 Aapitika, a resident of Chhatarpur district, had complained to the Commission that Shankar and Ajuddhi Patel raped her by taking the necklace of Bardwaha and Kodan village on the basis of gunfire
 ayog ne chhatarpur police adheekshak se prativedan maanga
 The Superintendent of Police found the complaint correct and BN Mitha's police station in-charge DN Raj was fined five hundred rupees by the Deputy Inspector General of Police of Chhatarpur Range for negligence

 The incident was dated 20 October 2010 and the crime was registered on 4 January 2011
 iskaa nateeja yah niklaa ki aavedika ko na to yathasamay aparaadh se bachaaya ja sakaa or na hi tatkaal sahaayta pahunchaayi ja saki
 Due to late registration of the crime, both the accused absconded and later one of the accused could be caught and the main culprit could not be caught
 tathyon se spasht he ki nireekshak di en raaj ne maanavadhikaar kaa hanan kiya
 The Commission has written that such a serious crime happened to a woman and the insensitivity that the Inspector of Police introduced, it is clear from this how much compassion he has towards women

 The serious case in which the accused should be arrested shows complete insensitivity
 iske baad bhi vah ayog main apana spashtikaran nahin dena chahta he
 Stressing that such insensitive policemen were fined only five hundred rupees for this serious negligence, the commission said that police officers should have taken the harshest action against such policemen, which would have given lessons to other policemen in this regard

 Addressing the country from Red Fort on the 72nd Independence Day, Modi announced the post of Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) or Chief of Defense
 unhone kaha ki sidies sarkaar ke ekal sainya salaahkaar honge, jo ''raksha balon ke bich talmail ko or tej'' karenge or ise ''or zyada asardaar'' banaaenge
 Even the government, which has made identity of secrecy, secrecy and surprise, was astonishing in that regard

 The division of powers between Army Headquarters was envisaged and the CDS was proposed to be a unified Headquarters of the Ministry rather than being a related office of the Ministry of Defense

 sena kii bhavishya kii yojanaayen alag-thalag banaai gai thim or unamem aapasi judaav bhi utana nahin tha, jitna hona chahie tha
 This army-centric approach put pressure on the limited defense budget and the result was that critical requirements could not be met

 The IDS, ie the one led by CDS, could then develop a unified plan and set mutual military priorities based on budget estimates
 masalan, ids tay kar saktaa tha ki kya zyada ahm or jaruri he-nausena ke liye ek teesraa vimanavahak yaa vaayu sena ke liye 110 ladaaku vimaan
 Accordingly, he could allocate the budget

 shankar arthath aadi shankaracharya kaa janm yaa kahen avatar- aap swechha se chunaav ke liye swatantra hai- isi din hua tha
 When his Guru asked Bal Shankar, who are you, he said 'chidanandarupa: Shivoham Shivoham'
 
 Spoken
 jisane bhi nirvana shatkam padhaa he, vah iske prabhaav main aae bagaiyr nahin rah saktaa
 However, instead of saying something different on Shankaracharya today, we have been a diplomat and politician on the birth anniversary of Shankar
 verma kii pustak 'aadi shankaracharya- hindu dharm ke mahaan vichaarak' kaa ansh yahaan prastut kar rahe
 This book has been published in Hindi and English by Westland Publications
 mul rup se angreji main likhi is kitaab kaa hindi anuwaad dhiraj kumaar ne kiya he
 Pawan k Verma writes in the role of this book - "hinduism, for most of its followers, is a way of life
 iskaa koi ek pope nahin he, koi ek dharmagranth nahin he, koi kathor nirdhaarit reeti-rivaaj nahin he, koi anivaary samooh nahin he, or naa hi koi ek mukhya mandir he
 Perhaps because of this it has been flourishing since eternity; It is eternal and infinite because that which is omnipresent but not limited to the transitory form, is indestructible
 lekin shaayad isi vajah se hi, adhiktar hindu jahaan ek ore apane tareeke se aasthaa kaa paalan karte hai, vahiin duusari ore apane dharm ke darshanik aadhaaron ke mahatv se anjaan hai
 "hindutva, as a religion, is no different from Hindutva philosophy
 agar hindu apane dharm ke darshanik aadhaar se dur hai, to wo ek tarah se jaanboojhkar iske bheetar ke khajaane ko chhodkar uskaa aavaran chun rahe hai
 When religion is largely confined to customs, there is an increased risk that the outer complexion will receive more importance than the essence
 main maanata hum ki yah hindutv ke liye, or iske mahaan santon, sanyasiyon or vichaarkon ke liye- jinhen ye pustak main vinamratapurvak samarpit karata hum- kshati hogi, jinhone is sanathan dharm ko vishwa kii kuch sarvaadhik pragadh darshanik antardrushti di he
 That is why i wrote this book
 "jagad guru aadi shankaracharya nihsandeh un mahanatam vidwaanon main ek the, jinhone antim satya kii hindu dharm kii athak khoj main yogadan diya
 His short life of thirty-two years is as amazing as the Advaita philosophy which he has expertly coined
 meraa uddeshy is mahaan vyaktitv or uske jivan kii khoj karnaa tha, or maine is talash main, unke janm sthal kerala ke kaladi se lekar, unke samadhi sthal kedarnath tak kii yatra kii- or adhiktar un sthanon par bhi main gaya jo unke jivan se sambandhit hai
 "not only did i measure India physically in length and breadth while following in the footsteps of Jagad Guru, but i also immersed myself in the mental journey of his philosophy, and its relationship with himself and the universe
 sach bataaun to mere puure shodh ke dauraan sabase mahatvapurn pahalu tha unke darshanik siddhanton, or aadhunik vigyaan ke avishkaron, visheshkar brahmad vigyaan, kwantum bhautikee or tantrika vigyaan, ke bich talmail kaa meraa shodh
 "the author then goes on to express his gratitude to many people, including Mani Shankar Dwivedi, scholar-politician, Dr
 I, expressing gratitude to many people for helping to write his book

 In addition, he has expressed his gratitude to his literary agent Mita Kapoor, publisher Westland Publications managing editor Sudha Sadanand, wife Renuka and Jagad Guru himself

 In Varma's own words - "finally i would like to bow my gratitude to Jagad Guru himself, which some of my readers may find strange

 Book excerpt: Adi Shankaracharya - the great thinker of Hinduism - a personal Yatraperiyar river sparkling like molten silver when the plane landed at Kochi Airport
 saamne kaa drishy ek bhavy chitrapat jaisaa tha jisamen nariyal ke ped, kele ke udyaan or falon ke bagan ke bich subjiyon kii hari pattiyaan saji hui thim
 The Kochi airport was built on the basis of Kerala's traditional architecture, modern but reminiscent of another era
 main kochi aayaa hum jagad guru bhagavad aadi shankaracharya kii janmasthali kaladi kii yatra karne, jahaan hawaii adde se bas bees minute main pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 It is close to Mahatma Gandhi Marg which leads out of Kochi
 788 isvi main, jab shankaracharya kaa janm hua tha, kaladi nishchit rup se apni alag pahchaan rakhane vaala ek chota gaanv rahaa hoga jo kochi shahar se zyada dur nahin he
 But, urbanization has eroded this distinct identity and now Kaladi is, in most ways, a suburb of Kochi
 ye bharat ke duusare shaharon se alag nahin dikhataa- dukaan, dhul, kaaren, motor cycle, scooter, kancreet or shor-sharaaba- sivaay is myne main ki yahi wo jagah he jahaan ek sahasrabdi or do sau varshon purv, ek aise bachche kaa janm hua tha jisane hindu dharm kii dhara ko badal diya tha or darshan or tatvamimasaa kaa str itnaa ooncha kar diya tha jisaki barabari aaj tak koi nahin kar sakaa he
 a nine-story octagonal building on the main road appears as the first sign of this memorable association
 ye he shri aadi shankaracharya paduka mandapam jisamen is mahaan sant kii pratimaa he
 This concrete looking building disappoints, it has neither special beauty nor any sign of the intellectual capacity of the person to whom it has been dedicated
 pravesh dwaar par kancreet ke do kaale hathi aapkaa swaagat karte hai, jahaan dhaatu ke jungle lage hai jinhen kholaa-band kiya ja saktaa he
 The main temple has a small statue of Shankaracharya dressed in white attire of ascetics, and around him are four of his principal disciples, Sureshwar, Totak, Hastamalaka, and Padmapada
 paas kii diwaar par betuke tareeke se shri kanchi shankar public skool ke dasvin kaksha ke chaatro kii tasviir lagi thi jinhone pariksha main 98 pratishat yaa zyada ank hasil kiye the
 a short distance from here, on the banks of the Periyar River, is the actual birthplace of Shankar
 periyar ko ‘purna’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 Unlike Paduka Mandapam, there is aesthetic peace in this place which immediately awakens the spirituality in the mind
 camel ke phulon se bharaa ek talab aapako ek paaramparik kerala mandapam kii taraf le jaataa he jisamen slate rang ke grenite lage hai
 On the western corner is a temple in memory of Shankaracharya; On the east side there is a temple dedicated to Brahmi's wife Brahmi, which is another name for Saraswati, the goddess of learning
 garbhagrih ke chaaron taraf parikrama main saptamata, devi ke saat avtaron, kii pratimaayein hai jinamein maheshwari, comari, vaishnavi, varahi, indrani or chamunda sammilit hai
 We will further see that Shankar has a very close relationship with Shakti
 mandapam main hamaara swaagat karte hai bikhri hui dadhi or safed baalo vaale ek vinamr bujurg professor subramania ayyar, jinhone paaramparik mundu or safed kameez pahan rakhi thi
 He is in charge of the Sanskrit college run by the Shankaracharya Peeth of Sringeri at Kaladi
 wo bataate hai ki kaladi ko kai sadiyon tak bhula diya gaya tha, jab tak ki unnisvin sadi ke antim varshon main, shringery peeth (shankaracharya dwaara sthapit pratham math) ke taintiswein mathadhish sachchidanand shivabhinav bharti ne mahaan sant-darshanik kii janmabhumi kii talash shuru nahin kii thi
 The problem was that there were three villages in Kerala by the name of Kaladi
 lekin, purna ke tat par ek hi kaladi tha or ye ek mahatvapurn sanket tha, kyonki shankaracharya kii sabhi paaramparik jivaniyon main ekamat se kaha gaya tha ki unka paariwarik ghar purna ke kinare tha
 There was another important proof
 jab shodh dal us ghar main pahunchaa jise shankar kaa mana ja rahaa tha, unhen ghar ke kone main ek pashaan stambh par diya jalaati hui striyaan milin
 When asked, he told that it was at this place that Shankar's mother, Aryamba, was cremated
 ***shankar ke mata-pita, aryamba or shivguru, nambudiri brahman the
 For this reason he was at the highest level socially, although there is no information about any other separate identity of Shivguru
 dampatti shastron main bataai gai dharmik ritiyon or shikshaaon ke anusaar paavan jivan bitaate the
 The emptiness of his life was his having no children
 kivdanti he ki ek raat unke kuldevataa, shiv, aryamba ke sapane main aae or ek bachche kii unki prarthana sweekaar kii
 Interestingly, Shiva gave two choices to Aryamba that she would either give birth to a fool whose life would be long or give birth to a scholar who would die in puberty
 kivdanti ke anusaar, aryamba ne doosraa vikalp chunaa
 According to modern historians, Shankar was born on the fifth day after Amavasya in april-may 788 AD
 [ aanandgiri kii jeevani, shankaravijay, main mana gaya he ki unka janm chidambaram main 44 isa purv main hua tha or mrityu 12 isa purv main hui thi
 Dr
 aar
 Yes
 bhandarkar unki janm tithi 680 isvi main maanate hai
 However, his most accepted life span is 788-820 AD
 ye shankar ke kumaril bhatta ke varnan par aadhaarit he, jinka kaal 700 isvi ke aasapaas tha, or saath hi shankar ne asang, nagarjun or ashwaghosh ke siddhanton ko asweekaar kiya tha, jinka jeevankaal teesri shatabdi isvi ke pehle kaa nahin tha, saath hi shankar bhartruhari ke baad aae the jinka jeevankaal yijing ke anusaar lagbhag 600 isvi kaa he
 Shankar had these dates as Max Müller, Paul Dussen and Drs
 es
 Radhakrishnan is also believed to be correct
 ]haalanki, duusare kai log is tithi se sahamat nahin hai, or unhen iske kaaphi pehle kaa bataate hai
 According to the guruparpanthas (documents kept by the gurus or mahants of the monasteries) housed in the monasteries of Dwarka, Puri and Kanchi, his life span was around 500 BCE, while according to the Sringeri Mutt he was born in 44 BCE
 sach ye he ki shankar kii janmatithi ke bare main pratyaksh pramaan kaa koi astitv nahin he, or aadhunik itihaaskaar jo unke lekhan ke nishkarshon or unke samakaleen yaa pehle janmi prasiddh hastiyon ke sandarbhon ke aadhaar par kehete hai ki unka janm 778 isvi main hua tha, unhen bhi duusari paramparaon ko sweekaar karnaa hota he, jo itihaas lekhan main nahin balki aasthaa (or isse jude tarkon) par aadhaarit hoti hai
 Despite the controversy over his date of birth, other details of his life can be reconciled with his existing biographies and the evidence associated with them
 ham jaanate hai ki balak shankar ne behad kam umr se hi apni chamatkaarik pratibha dikhaani shuru kar di thi
 It is said that he had memorized the Vedas and the basic Sanskrit texts even before he completed the age of three years, due to his extraordinary memory power, he used to remember what he once heard
 eka shruti dhara
 It is almost certain that from the very beginning, he began to show a tendency to live a life of sannyas, and to abandon the traditional comforts which were readily available to the talented children of his social background
 swaabhaavik rup se, ye unki mata ke liye chintaa kaa vishay tha
 While she was proud of her son's intellectual maturity, which was discussed throughout the village and beyond, she did not want her son to become a monk
 kisi bhi anya mata ke samaan wo chaahati thim ki unka putr vivaah kare, bachche paidaa kare or unke saath rahe, visheshkar isliye kyonki unke pati, shivguru kii mrityu tabhi ho gai thi jab shankar kii aayu bahut kam thi or wo vidhwaa kaa jivan bitaa rahi thim
 However, Shankar was not deterred by his decision to renounce worldly life and spend the life of a monk
 mata or putr ke bich main nishchit rup se kaaphi tanaav rahaa hoga, lekin ek aisi ghatana ke baad is vishay par faisla ho gaya, jisamen kuch kalpana dikhti he or kuch tathy
 It is said that once when Shankar was bathing in the river, a crocodile caught his leg
 unhone apni mata ko pukarkar kaha: ‘maa! mujhe bachaao! ek magaramchh ne mujhe pakad liya he or main tab tak nahin batch saktaa jab tak tum mujhe sanyasi banane kii anumati nahin deteen
 Mother, don't be late, otherwise it will be too late! ' Aryamba hesitated for a moment, but was dragging her son into crocodile deep water, and had no choice but to agree
 jaise hi unhone apni anumati di, kaha jaataa he ki magaramchh ne shankar ko mukt kar diya or gaayab ho gaya
 Was there really such an incident, or was it a flight of imagination of a biographer? It is difficult to give a clear answer
 is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki kisi naatakeey ghatana ne aryamba ko haa kehane ke liye vivash kiya hoga, kyonki saamaanya paristhitiyon main, ek vidhwaa mata apane putr ko apana tyaag karne kii anumati kabhi nahin degi
 It may also be that Shankar did some trick to get his mother's consent
 duusari taraf, magaramchh sansaarik jivan kaa ek roopak ho saktaa he, jisase shankar ne mukti paa lee thi, kisi kalpanasheel itihaaskaar ne pratikwaad kii yukti nikaali ho
 Facts, legends, narratives and symbolism blend together in such stories, but it is true that even today, very close to Shankar's house, there is a crocodile pier where this decisive moment is remembered, and one The annual festival is held
 aryamba ne dabaav main apni sahmati to de di thi, lekin wo akele rahane ko lekar chintit bhi thim
 He also had a traditional concern about who would perform his funeral
 shankar ne unhen aashwast kiya tha ki jab bhi unki mata, chaahe jaagrath ho yaa besudh, ko unki jarurat hogi, wo laut aaenge
 He also pledged that he would perform the last rites after his death, even though it was traditionally forbidden for saints to live
 is pratigya ke saath, unhone mata se vidaa lee or bachapan main hi, upyukt guru kii talash main ghar chhod diya
 The search brought him across the Deccan plateau and the Satpura ranges to Omkareshwar on the banks of the Narmada River, which is in the Vindhyas and slightly south of Indore
 shahar kii pahadiyaan uun kii akruti se milti-julati hai, or shahar ke kinare bahane vaali narmada bhi uun kii tarah dikhti he
 Actually, Omkareshwar is an island, on one side it is surrounded by Narmada and on the other by Reva, a tributary of Narmada
 donon nadiyaan, jo omkareshwar se thik pehle alag hoti hai, shahar ko paar karne ke baad mil jaati hai
 For centuries before the arrival of Shankar, Omkareshwar was known as a holy city, where one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, symbolizing Shiva, is located
 lekin ye mandir mukhya kaaran nahin tha jo shankar saikadon mile dur ghaney jangalon ko paar karke omkareshwar aae the
 His quest was for the true Guru, and he knew that in this city resided Vedanta scholar Govindapada, who was a disciple and son of the famous Gaudapada
 goudpad ne karika kii rachana kii thi, jo manducya upanishad par praathmik vyakhya he
 Most people believe, and the locals also believe that when Shankar came to meet Gaudapada, he was meditating inside a cave
 shankar gupha ke baahar pratiksha karte rahe, or jab goudpad dhyaan kii avasthaa se baahar aae, unhone us chote balak se poocha: ‘tum koun ho?’kivdanti ke anusaar, iske uttar main shankar ne ek shloke padhaa: ‘main naa to prithvi hum, naa jal, naa agni, naa vaayu, naa akaash, or naa hi koi anya padaarth
 i am neither sensible nor mind
 main shiv hum, chetana kaa avibhajya saar
 Hearing such a pithy reply, Gaudapada took Shankar under his protection
 kai sthaan par aisa varnit he ki apni sweekruti jataane ke liye, goudpad ne apana ek pair gupha ke baahar failaayaa or shankar ne adarpurvak jhukkar uskaa sparsh kiya
 It is not certain how long Shankar lived in Gaudapada's ashram
 ham maan sakate hai ki wo atharah maheene se lekar teen varsh tak vahaan rahe honge, jis dauraan unhone advait darshan main maharath hasil kii hogi
 You can imagine how Omkareshwar would have been twelve hundred years ago: a island island, surrounded by lush greenery, clean waters of the Narmada and Reva, an ancient temple on the hillside, and adjoining Govindapada's ashram
 
 aaj ye kitna badal gaya he? or jo kuch bachaa he, unamem se kitni chijen shankar kii yatra or yahaan unke padaav ke tathyon kii pushti karti hai?***ye pataa lagane ke liye maine dilli se indore kii udaan bhari
 i was accompanied by my wife, Renuka, and the talented and unassuming artist, Manish Pushkale, who is from the same region

 We first went to the simple middle-class house of Mr
 Cloth Market Girls Commerce College, Dr
 Mangal Yashwant Mishra, and his wife Chhaya

 i had to tell them that they should apply to the Guinness World Record for the most degrees
 unhone is suzav ko prashansa ke rup main sweekaar kiya, or halke se kataaksh ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 However, they are highly sociable
 unki sahaj vinamrata, or unki patni chaaya—jo swayan shri cloth market girls commers college main padhaati hai—ke baat-vyavhaar ne hamaara dil jeet liya
 We were served lunch with homemade dafla (a local dish made of wheat), lentils, rice, kadhi and vegetables, and pudding in sweet
 ek saadhaaran dhoti or baniyaan pahane hue, dow
 Mishra talked to us about Omkareshwar during lunch
 unhen koi andeh nahin tha ki shankar omkareshwar main govindpad ke ashram main ruke the or iske samarthan main unhone unke jivan ke kai prasangon kaa varnan kiya
 His narrative contained mythological narratives and facts
 unhone kaha ki wo gupha jahaan shankar kii mulaakaat govindpad se hui thi, wo vahaan abhi bhi he
 Also across the Narmada, there is a temple at Mamaleshwar, which was built by Shankar for pilgrims who could not visit the main Shiva temple at Omkareshwar during monsoon as the Narmada was in spate
 mamaleshwar kaa mandir dweep par bane mandir ke sadrush he
 The original temple is called Sankalpa, and substitutes its replica built across the river
 hamen vidwaan dow
 Mishra did not get to know anything very new, except that he had a personal faith in Shankar's relationship with Omkareshwar
 jab ham vidaa le rahe the, unhone mere haathon main shivlinga kii akruti kaa ek chota pathar rakhaa, or kaha ki narmada main paaya jane vaala aisa har pathar shiv or shankaracharya donon ke sanyukt aashirwad kaa pratik he
 Our next stop was the house of Mithilesh Prasad Tripathi, who was of a completely different nature than the humble Mishraji
 unke lalaat par laal tilak tha; unki golakaar akruti se bhav aata tha ki wo swayan ko gambhirtha se liye jane kii aashaa karte the; moorkhon se baat karke unhen koi prasannataa nahin hoti; sanskrit kaa jeevanabhar adhyayan karne par unhen garv tha, wo nakli vidwaanon ko sidhe khaarij kar dete the; unhone saaf kar diya tha ki unhen paaramparik soch sahan nahin he, or un panditon se unki naaraazgi thi jo prathaon ke peeche kaa arth jane bagaiyr unka paalan karte rahete the
 Tripathi insisted that all evidences indicate that Shankar had come to Omkareshwar, and stayed at Govindapada's ashram
 unhone kaha ki shankar ne govindpad, or unke pita goudpad se advait kii shiksha ko omkareshwar main aatmsaat kiya tha, or unke yuva mastishk par iskaa prabhaav lambey samay tak rahaa
 During his stay here, Shankar should be seen as a student who was keen to know the specifics of Vedanta
 seekhney ke prati uski lalak andeh ke pare thi, or, govindpad kaa gurukul aisa karne ke liye adarsh vaataavaran detaa tha, jahaan shikshak vidhyaarthiyon ko adhyayan, jaanch or chintan kii kathor samay-sarini ke anusaar shiksha dete the
 There was a lot of talk here and there during our open conversation, as Tripathi, who sat cross-legged on the diwan of his small meeting, repeatedly deviated from the main topic and criticized some of his counterparts in the field of Sanskrit studies
 Used to be lekin, ek mahatvapurn bindu tha jis ore unhone meraa dhyaan dilaayaa
 He told me not to focus solely on Shankar's philosophy and his intellectual outlook
 nihsandeh, wo to mahatvapurn he, lekin utana hi mahatvapurn he ye jaananaa ki shankar ne goudpad ke math main janaseva, or un kendron ke nirmaan ke sandarbh main kya siikhaa, jahaan advait darshan ko padhaayaa ja sake or surakshit rakhaa ja sake
 Although Shankar Mimamsa was against ritualism (following practices according to Vedic instructions), he supported this type of selfless service, and the foundation of his thinking lay in Omkareshwar
 apane saare akkhadpan ke baavjood, treepathiji hamaare vidaa lene tak hamaare saath kaaphi ghul-mil gaye the, or hamen vidaa kehane hamaari car tak aae the
 While we were leaving, he said that he loved being alone
 unhone bataaya ki unki patni apane bacchon ke paas america gai hai, or unka bhatija unki dekhbhaal karata he
 He was quite a recluse, immersed in his study of Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy, and is content with being alone among his thousands of books, but if someone challenges his ideas, he turns up to argue
 omkareshwar tak hamaari yatra ke dauraan ham vindhyas shrenee se gujarey
 The roads were winding, the terrain filled with hills and teak trees, withering in the scorching sun, and their paper-like dry leaves scattered all over
 hamen omkareshwar main gajanan maharaj ashram pahunchane main do ghante lage, jahaan hamaare thaharne kii vyavastha kii gai thi
 The ashram, which was very close to the Narmada, was like a desert of peace and greenery, with a quiet temple in the center of the complex
 ashram ke prashaasak joshiji ne hamaara swaagat chaay or biscuit se kiya or hamen hamaare kamare dikhaae, jo sade lekin saaf, vaataanukoolit, or aadhunik shauchalayon ke saath the
 We came to know that Gajanan Maharaj was from Shevgaon in Maharashtra, a contemporary of Shirdi Sai Baba, and a large number of his devotees are present
 ashram main har taraf unki tasviren lagi hui thim, ek duble-patale or lambey purush, bikhri hui dadhi or andar tak bhedane vaali ankhen, haath main chilam, or, kuch tasveeron main, sharir par koi vastra tak nahin
 In the evening we went to see the Omkareshwar temple and the cave where Shankaracharya is supposed to meet Govindapada
 mandir tak pahunchane ke liye hamane narmada ko ek navnirmit pul par se paidal paar kiya
 It was a full moon night, and also Hanuman Jayanti; Aarti was going on many ghats built on the banks of the river; The hymns being sung in praise of Rama and Shiva were buzzing; Narmada was shining like silver in the moon's rays — a truly supernatural sight
 mandir pahari kii dhaal par bana hua he
 Originally it must have been a cave, but now, outside, there is a mandapam with fine carvings on the pillars and arches
 garbh grih main ek shivlinga he jo jameen se baahar nikali hui patharilii rachana he
 It is believed that it is self-born, spontaneously born, one of the twelve Jyotirlingas established by Shiva himself
 ling ke peeche shiv kii ardhangini parvati kii pratimaa he
 It is said that this is the only one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, where Parvati is part of the womb house
 yahaan puure din ek akhand jyoti jalati rahati he
 We saw the sleeping aarti at 9 pm, after which Shiva and Parvati are left alone overnight
 is aarti ke liye hone vaala prabandh aasthaa or maanav kalpanaashakti donon ko shradhanjali he
 a cradle for the divine couple is furnished with dark pink brocade
 unke manoranjan ke liye jhule par chapad-pasa ke khel ke liye chaarkhaanedaar kapadaa bichaaya jaataa he
 The game consists of twelve pawns, which are of the shape of a linga, and represent twelve jyotirlingas
 raat main kisi ko bhi devi or devtaa kii shanti bhang karne kii anumati nahin hoti
 It is believed that when the priests enter the temple in the morning, the pieces are shaken from their place
 mandir se kuch kadam dur wo gupha he jahaan shankar govindpad se mili the
 Although outside the entrance is a well-built brick structure, the cave is clearly set aside from it
 gupha ke bheetar kaale pathar main shankar kii pratimaa he
 In this, he is shown sitting on a high pedestal, and in his left hand is a well-known petitioner
 unke upar, ek pashaan bhitti-chitra he jisamen shankar kii divine shaktiyon ke bare main ek lokapriy dantakatha darshai gai he
 Once, when the Narmada was in full swing, its water was in danger of entering the cave where Govindapada was in deep meditation
 apane guru kii shanti main baadha pahunchane se rokane ke liye, shankar ne apana haath uthaaya or nadi kaa pani peeche chalaa gaya
 Another narration of this legend tells that he raised his kalash or beggar, and all the water of the river merged into it
 pashaan bhitti-chitra main dikhaaya gaya he ki govindpad gupha ke andar dhyanamgn hai, or shankar, jinke pair ufanti nadi main hai, nadi ko niyantrit kar rahe hai
 There is another very interesting statue inside the cave
 ye kaali, devi maa, kii pratimaa he, lekin iskaa chithran tantric he, sharir par laal sari he, mukhaakriti spasht nahin he lekin lalaat par laal tilak he
 The most compelling feature of this depiction is the eyes of Goddess, black and penetrating vision, which haunts you in every direction in a scary way
 mandir kaa mukhya pujari mujhe bataata he ki ye pratimaa shankar kii bengal yatra ke baad banaai or gupha main rakhi gai thi
 There he met many tantrikas, and was unable to defeat him in debate or debate because his knowledge in Tantrism was not sufficient
 isliye, wo omkareshwar laute or kaali siddhi ke rup main tantra siikhaa
 This idol of Goddess was installed at that time
 aisa mana jaataa he ki swayan ko tantravaad main nipun karne ke baad shankar phir se bengal gaye or apane tantric pratidwandviyon ko parrast kiya
 *** Narmada is a beautiful river
 haalanki omkareshwar main ab isaki dhara patali he kyonki upar kii taraf kai baandh bana die gaye hai, abhi bhi ye ek aakarshak nadi he or kai kaarnon se bilkul alag bhi
 It is the only major river in India that flows from east to west; It is also the only river with temples built on both sides, due to which it is also called the Umbrella Beach Teerth
 narmada naam kaa bhi vishesh mahatv he
 Nar means male, and female means female: The river signifies the powers of both, or the combination of powers of both as depicted in the concept of Ardhanarishwara, Ardhanarishwara is a bisexual deity in Hindu mythology
 agali subah, jab ham narmada main praat:kaal dubkee lagane ke baad omkareshwar se ja rahe the, main is shahar ke saath shankar ke sambandh ke bare main soch rahaa tha
 How would he have passed through the dense forests from Kaladi in remote Kerala? Was there a known way to reach this holy city, or did they take the help of traditional methods of shipping? In an era when communication was at an early stage, how did he get to know about Govindapada, and his father, Gaudapada? Until this time there was no raid
 phir wo advait darshan par goudpad ke moulik kaary ke bare main kaise jaanate the? kya unhen karika yaa manducya upanishad ke bare main maukhik paath se jaankaree mili thi jo ek shishy se duusare tak prasaarit hoti thi, or aakhir kis tarah ye itani dur kaladi tak pahunchi thi? pathan-pathan kaa aisa kya anaupchaarik jaal us samay vidyaman tha jo soochnaaon ke is pravaah ko sambhav banaata tha?darshanashastra kii asaadhaaran talash or dharmik prathaon ke sanskaron ke bich aapasi sambandh ne bhi mujhe chaunkaaya
 It is said that Govindapada and Shankaracharya started their day with a visit to the nearby Jyotirlinga
 us gupha main jahaan govindpad rahete the, bauddhik anusandhan hota tha advait, gunathit brahm ke bare main, jo maanviya nirupan ke pare tha, maanviya puja-paath se pare tha, niraakaar tha or sabhi dharmik sanskaron se pare tha
 But once he entered the temple, he offered obeisance to Shiva and Parvati, performing all the religious rites for the worship of a personified deity, including shrines for Shiva and Parvati to spend the night with blissful joy
 Preparation was done and a game of four-dice was also included for entertainment
 daivatv kaa asaadhaaran maanvikaran, or karmkand tathaa puja-paath ke aadambar ke peeche chintan or anusandhan, in donon kaa sah-astitv nirbaadh tha
 After a few years stay at Omkareshwar, and when he had mastered the deepening of the Advaita doctrine in the association of Govindapada, Shankaracharya asked his guru to go to Varanasi
 unhen paidal is lambii yatra ko puraa karne main kai maheene lage honge, ghaney jangalon se, or agyaat kshetron se guzarana padaa hoga, or luteron or daakuon ke hamale ke khataron se bhi jujhna padaa hoga
 In Varanasi, he lived for many years, and here he did many of his important writing works, including Shankar Bhashya, his interpretation of the Brahma Sutra, his interpretation on the Bhagavad Gita, and the Chief Upanishads
 shankar ne varanasi jane kaa faisla kyon kiya tha? bilkul spasht he ki, ye shahar tab bhi, hindu aasthaa kii rajdhani tha, jahaan sant or darshanik ganga ke tat par nivas karte the, or hindu darshan ke kai pahaluon par vrahat samvaad kiya karte the
 It was a perfect platform for a scholar of Hindu ideology to prove his / her reputation through discussion, debate and interaction with other philosophical scholars
 isliye, ye swaabhaavik tha ki shankar, darshanik vidwaan ke rup main jinaki khyaati dur-dur tak fail chuki thi, varanasi main nivas karne kii sochate
 *** i traveled there to try to gather more information about Shankar's stay in Varanasi
 hawaii adde par mujhe lene mere puraane mitra, ashok kapur aae
 He is an eminent Sanskritist from Varanasi, and is currently the Convenor of INTACH in the city, his keen interest is in the revival of the dilapidated and neglected historical sites of this city, one of the oldest cities in the world
 varanasi, jise banaras or kaashi ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, ganga ke pashchimi tat par sankari galiyon or mandiron kii vishaal bhulbhulaiya he
 In these streets, there is such a dense population that is beyond human imagination
 kabhi-kabhi, aapako aashcharya ho saktaa he ki aisi paristhiti main kaise log, mandir, motorcycle, scooter, kute, gaay, gandagi or shor ek-saath rahete hai, jahaan sthaan or jansankhya kaa anupaat avishwasaneey rup se bigadaa hua he
 But, Varanasi has challenged incredible things since time immemorial
 is pracheen shahar kaa aadhuniktaa se judaav, us shahar ke rup main jo ab ghaaton or galiyon se kaaphi aage ja chukaa he, behad ulajhaa hua kaha ja saktaa he
 Our journey to the airport took much longer than necessary because a flyover, which should have finished much earlier, was still under construction
 nayaa shahar yatayaat, shor, pradooshan or gandagi se bharaa he, sankshep main, nagarpalika ke liye bura sapana he jiskaa koi aasaan samaadhaan nahin he
 However, the wonderful thing is that the people of Varanasi accept all of these with great calm, perhaps because they are born reclusive, that is, irrespective of the sufferings of the mortal world, do not worry too much for what is wrong
 , After all, time is infinite, and like the millennium-old Ganges, they are just one particle on the infinite canvas of time
 varanasi main main sabase pehle rukaa sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay
 There Professor Hari Prasad Adhikari, head of the Faculty of Philosophy, who teaches comparative Dharmadarshan, arranged for me to meet with Shankar and scholars of Hindu philosophy
 vahaan koi mej or kursiyaan nahin hai
 We sit on a white sheet on the floor and like to support our back
 satr kii shuruyaat hoti he mangalacharya se, jo dharmik mantron yaa stotron kii vandana he or jise shankaracharya ne likhaa tha
 It seemed as if that time was being repeated when there would be debate in the days of Shankar
 hindu darshanashastra ke vibhinn pahaluon ke kai professor maujuud hai
 Each of them is a staunch supporter of his approach and interpretation
 wo sabhi shankar dwaara viksit advait siddhant kii shreshthata ko sweekaar karte hai, lekin sabhi ke us par apane alag-alag vichaar hai, or wo iskaa moolyankan apane darshanik drushtikon se karte hai
 a tremendous debate ensues, and Sanskrit shlokas begin to rain, as every speaker utters wisdom, direct knowledge, the validity of Shruti, the influence of intelligence on Shankar's thoughts, the limits of monotheism and later Hindu philosophers like Ramanuja Developed by, seems to offer different perspectives on esoteric subjects like Advaita
 uttejnaa badhati he or vichaaron kaa takaraav hota he
 When someone interrupts a speaker, he strongly protests that it is against the rules of debate, where every object must be allowed to fully present its point of view before objections are lodged
 professor adhikari paricharchaa ko santulit karne kii bharpoor koshish karte hai lekin aksar unki baat ansuni ho jaati he
 This lasts for more than an hour, until the officials conclude the meeting with a sub-makeup, which is a form of summary and vote of thanks
 is samay tak sabhi kaa paara neeche aa chukaa hota he, or mujhe bataaya jaataa he ki hindu aadhyatm vigyaan ke gudh binduon par aisa vaicharik takaraav darshanashastra ke shikshakon ke is chote samooh main behad aam baat he, jinhone apana puraa jivan sanskrit granthon ke adhyayan main bitaayaa he
 In a debate a few years ago, a professor, whose scholar was highly respected, was so enraged by his rival's interpretation of Shankar's theories that he died of a heart attack while refuting it
 ye kuch-kuch avastavik lag rahaa tha jo maine dekha tha
 Here, in a simple neglected room of the university, a handful of people were discussing as if their lives depended on it, issues that most Hindus knew nothing about! Was what i had just seen, a revival of the same thing that must have happened on the banks of the Ganges during Shankar's time? Perhaps yes, but the difference is that even then ordinary people were not completely ignorant of the topics of discussion, and actually lived the Hindu philosophical experience of assumptions and arguments
 sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay bharat ke sabase puraane shaikshanik sansthaanon main se he
 It was founded in 1791, by an Englishman, Jonathan Duncan, who had told Governor General Lord Cornwallis the need for a Sanskrit college to translate important texts, including those for administrative needs
 20,000 rupye ke salanaa bajet ko manjuuri mili, or jon muir ko college kaa pehla principal niyukt kiya gaya
 In 1857, the college began postgraduate studies, and in 1974 it was granted university status
 lekin ye vishvavidhyalay ab murjhaa rahaa he kyonki zyaadaatar bharatiyon ke paas sanskrit or iske granthon main samahit gyaan ke liye samay nahin he
 Therefore, in many ways, professors who have excitedly debated the Sanskrit verses have become like relics in their own country to discuss the mysteries of Hindu philosophy
 college ke saraswati pustkaalay, jisaki sthapana 1894 main hui thi, main sanskrit pandulipiyon kaa sabase moolyawaan sangrah he, lekin unamem se adhiktar padhe bhi nahin gaye hai
 The motto of the university is Gopay in Srutam - May my knowledge be preserved
 durbhagyavash, aisa lagata he ki british - bhale hi kinhi khaas vajahon se- ise lekar zyada chintaa karte the, jitani ham aaj karte hai
 No professor could give me historical details about Shankar's stay in Varanasi
 unka tark tha ki us yug main, vidwaanon kaa dhyaan vichaaron or avadharanaon par adhik tha, banispat kaal-kram or kaarysthal ke, or is kaaran bhavi peedi ke liye koi vivaran nahin choda gaya
 What did Benares look like when Shankar lived here? Where did they live And how long did he stay here? It seemed that no one knew
 nishchit rup se, shahar kaaphi chota rahaa hoga, ghaaton yaa nadi tat par sidhiyon, or ganga ke tat par bani bastiyon tak simit rahaa hoga
 The labyrinth of narrow streets that lead to the banks of the river would have remained, but with a much smaller population; The city must have been comparatively clean, the river must have been clean, and there would be more space on the coast, where sages and scholars could stay with their attendants
 main kedaar ghat gaya jahaan sambhawatah chaudaavin sadi main shringery math kii ek shakha sthapit kii gai thi
 i drew this conclusion from a strip inside the 'sri Jagadguru Shankaracharya Math' on which it was written: "the establishment and worship of this ancient Chandramaulishwara Lingam was done by the venerable Sri Vidyaranya Mahaswamiji Sri Sringeri Sharda Peethadhipati in 1346 AD
 ” math ke bheetar ek mandir he jisamen ganesh or devi sharada kii puja hoti he, saath hi un donon ke bich main aadi shankaracharya kii waisi hi murti sthapit he, jaisi kaladi main he
 Did Sringeri Math choose this place because Shankar lived here or somewhere near it? The region has a large presence of residents of South India
 ye kshetreey sambandh kitna purana he, or kya dakshin se yatri yahaan basane ke liye hajaar varsh pehle aae the? agar aisa he, to is baat kii sambhaavna he ki kerala se aane vaale shankar ne yahaan rahane kaa faisla kiya hoga
 But, no one has these answers
 shringery math sunsaan dikh rahaa tha, jahaan mujhe kisi shodh yaa adhyayan kii koi halchal nahin dikhi
 It seemed that it served only as a hospice for those coming from outside, and the managers were not interested in anything other than this
 shahar main math kaa ek ashram bhi he, or kanchi math kaa bhi ashram he, jo banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay parisar ke najadik he
 It is called ‘sri Jagat Guru Shankaracharya Ashram’
 iske dwaar par ek bada sa notice board laga he jis par likhaa he ki parisar main dhumrapaan or gutkha khaanaa manaa he, lekin jo log ise chalaate hai unhen bhi varanasi main jagadguru ke nivas se jude kisi aitihaasik byore kaa kuch pataa nahin he
 i also went to the Manikarnika Ghat, because some people believe that Shankar stayed here
 yahaan, har koi mritkon ko chitaagni dene ke kaam main laga tha
 As i was going through the narrow lanes towards the ghat, the people who shouldered the dead were passing by chanting 'ram Naam Satya Hai', and engaged in the gathering of the last rites of the dead body
 apane aap main ye bemail sa lagata he ki mritkon kaa antim sanskaar karne kii jagah kitni jeevant he
 Like a shrub that thrives in a tropical forest, life seems to flourish from every corner of the ghat, and the effects of sound, touch, smell, and sight are so dense that they are now dormant and devoid of sense perception Dominates efforts to liberate

 Rana P
 bi
 Singh is a retired professor of geography at BHU, and i meet him in his modest home on the university campus
 unka sada bartaav aapako ye nahin bataata ki wo is baat ke vaigyanik kaarnon kii jaanch karne ke liye vishwavikhyath visheshgy hai ki kyon koi sthaan pavitra sthal banane ke liye chunaa jaataa he
 Dr
 singh ne kaashi ke ‘pavitra bhugol’ or ‘antarikshawya jyamiti’ kaa surveykshan kiya he, or iske liye unhone iske kai mandiron or pavitra sthalon ke chaaron taraf chumbakeey shaktiyon kaa adhyayan kiya he, saath hi global pojishning satelliton ke nishkarshon kaa milan pavitra granthon or shahar kii paramparaon ke saath kiya he
 He tells me that the word Kashi means 'where the light coming from space is concentrated in a circular form'
 wo kehete hai ki shahar main ek suvyavasthit tirthagaman tantra he jisamen chaar gyaat ‘bhitari pavitra yatraaen’ hai or wo sabhi pramanit rup se ek hi bindu par samaapt hoti hai
 This point, which he calls 'axis Mundi', is Gyan Vapi
 agar ye sach he to ye meri talash ke liye ek dilachasp sambhaavna kaa rasta khol detaa he
 Gyan Vapi, meaning the well of knowledge, is at the same place where the city's most famous Shiva temple, Kashi Vishwanath Temple used to be
 mandir main sthapit shivlinga bharat bhar main baarah aise lingon main se ek he, or ye behad pracheen he jiskaa varnan skanda puraana or duusare pracheen hindu granthon main miltaa he
 In 1194 AD, the temple was destroyed by Qutubuddin Aibak, but rebuilt by a Gujarati merchant in the thirteenth century
 ise dobaaraa pandrahavin sadi main hossain shah yaa sikandar lodhi ne nasht kar diya tha, lekin badshaah akbar ke shasankaal main raja maansingh ne iskaa phir se punarnirmaan karaayaa tha
 However in 1669 AD, Aurangzeb decisively demolished the temple and built the Gyan Vapi Mosque on its remains
 (mandir ke avshesh par bani nai masjid kii jaankaree 1834 ke james princep ke sketch se milti he
 ) Finally in 1780, AD, Holkar Rani, Ahilya Bai built a new temple at a nearby place
 itihaas kuch bhi ho, mul vishwanath mandir nishchit rup se isaki mul jagah, gyaan vaapi par rahaa hoga, jab shankar ne varanasi kii yatra kii hogi
 Now, Shankar's attachment to Shiva is known, and he would have wanted his abode to be near his beloved deity, and the most revered temple of Kashi
 lekin is sambhaavna main ek or pahalu he
 Gyan Vapi is located on Lalitha Ghat
 lalita, kalyaan kii pratik, shiv kii patni parvati kaa paryaay he
 Lalitha Sahasranama is a book in the Brahmanda Purana and an important book for Shakti worshipers
 shakti sampradaay or ‘devi mata’ kii avadharana ke prati shankar kaa jhukaav is tathy se pramanit hota he ki unke dwaara sthapit chaaron math shaktipeeth kehalaate hai
 Also, Manikarnika Ghat is just a short distance from here
 ye kaashi ke lagbhag assi ghaaton main sabase puraane main se he or iskaa varnan paanchavi sadi ke ek gupt kaal abhilekh main miltaa he
 Manikarnika means the earring coil
 puranic manyata ke anusaar, apane pita daksh ke swayan or apane pati ke prati ruukhe vyavhaar ke baad jab sati ne aatmadah kar liya, to dukh se bhare shiv ne unke mrit sharir ko uthaaya or krodh main bharkar himalay par tandav karne lage
 Eventually, not seeing his suffering end, Vishnu, with the help of Sudarshan Chakra, divided Sati's body into fifty-one pieces that fell to the ground
 jahaan bhi unke sharir kaa koi tukdaa yaa paridhaan gira, wo ek shaktipeeth ban gaya
 According to mythological belief, the coil of Sati fell in Manikarnika and since then the ghat has been named Manikarnika Ghat
 isliye, shakti sampradaay ke liye manikarnika ghat ek mahatvapurn puja sthal he or ise ekaanya shaktipeeth kaha jaataa tha
 Professor Singh points out that the Manikarnika Ghat was specifically seen as a cremation ground only in the late eighteenth century
 isliye, ye kahana ki varanasi main apane padaav ke dauraan shankar, shiv ke sarvaadhik mahatvapurn mandir vishwanath mandir, or saath main shakti sampradaay (jiske prati shankar kaa jhukaav baad ke pramaanon se siddh hota he) ke mahatvapurn sthalon lalita or manikarnika ghat ke paas rahanaa chaahate honge, niraadhaar nahin he
 However, this is only a conjecture, as no concrete evidence (except a description in Chidavilas's biography once) is available
 ye is baat kaa saboot he ki parampirak rup se itihaas lekhan kii upeksha to hui he hi, haal ke dinon main, academik shodh or jigyaasa bhi upekshit he
 Whatever the exact place of Shankar's residence in Kashi, some biographical incidents have been described by his biographers
 shankar digvijaym ke naam se unki kai jivaniyaan hai, lekin sabase lokapriy he madhavacharya kii likhi jeevani, jinhone baad main shri vidyaarany naam dhaaran kiya or shringery sharada peetham ke 12wein pramukh (1380-1386) bane
 In these traditional accounts, there is a lot of exaggeration in the miracles performed by Shankar
 agar inhen jeevanikaron kii kalpanaashakti maan len, to bhi ham kuch aisi ghatnaayen dekhte hai jo sabhi vivaranon main ek jaisi hai or, isliye, unamem kuch to aadhaar hona chahie
 Everyone is unanimous that in Kashi, Shankar had found Sanandan, one of his most devoted devotees
 kivdanti he ki ek din jab sanandan nadi kii duusari ore tha, shankar ne use chalate hue nadi paar kar lautne ko kaha
 Without thinking anything, the disciple, with full faith, started obeying
 jab usne aisa kiya to ganga ne uski madad ke liye ek camel utpann kiya, or phir sanandan ne vastav main chalakar nadi paar kii
 Henceforth, Shankar renamed him Padmapada (having lotus in his feet)
 lekin kinvadantiyon ko chhod diya jaae to, varanasi kii teen ghatnaayen hai, jo shankar kii soch or us kaal kii saamaajik sanrachana kaa chitra prastut karne ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 The first incident is his meeting with a Chandal, who is traditionally believed to come from the lowest rung of society
 ye mulaakaat tatbandh kii sankari galiyon main hui thi
 Actually, Shankar was going for a bath in the Ganges when he saw Chandal coming
 un dinon, mana jaataa tha ki is jati ke logon kii upasthiti maatr se brahman ashuddh ho jate hai, or isliye shankar ke shishyon ne chandal ko raste se hat jane ko kaha
 However, Chandal retaliated by asking the question: 'how did there be such a difference in the Advaita doctrine that "it is a Chandala and it is a Brahmin"? After all, all the bodies have the same soul, irrespective of their caste? ”shankar was shocked to hear this, and immediately said that whoever considers Brahma as the only reality and sees all souls alike, is respectable
 
 duusari sabhi bhinnataayen asaty hai, or chandal, jisane sarvocch chetana kii ekta kaa anubhav kar liya he, mere guru ke samaan he
 This idea has been replaced in Manisha Panchakam, the composition of Shankara's five verses, one of which means something like this: i am the Brahman
 or, ye sampurna jagat shuddh chetana se prasaarit he
 All this, without any residuals, is invoked by me through avidya which has three qualities (sattva, raja and tam)
 isliye, wo, jisamen shaashvat, nishkalank or adwitiya sukh pradaan karne vaali sarvocch satta yani brahm ke bare main sachcha gyaan he, wo guru he, chaahe wo chandal ho yaa brahman
 This is my final approach
 jati pratha par shankar ke vichaaron par vistaar se unke darshanashastra par adhyay main charchaa kii gai he
 It is necessary to point out here that some biographers have underestimated Chandal's scholarship to vindicate the legitimacy of a radical and biased social system
 unke vivaran ke mutabik, jaise hi shankar ne apane vichaar rakhe - jo saamaajik-dharmik kattarta ko nakaarne waalon ke liye krantikari the - chandal gaayab ho gaya or uski jagah par shiv or chaar veda upasthit ho gaye
 The attempt here is to make Chandal's extraordinary statement for equality negligible, and that the entire event, in the form of Shiva and Vedas, be worn with a sacred veil
 sanskrit vishvavidhyalay ke jin vidwaanon se main mila, unhone bhi kaaphi kuch aisa hi kiya, jab unhone bataaya ki chandal vaali ghatana or kuch nahin balki ye pradarshit karne kaa tarika he ki kaashi main nichle se nichle samudaay main bhi darshaniktaa bhari hui thi
 However, the truth seems to be that his meeting with Chandal was a way for Shankar to categorically reject the social exclusion developed by man-made institutions, and which matches his own philosophical arguments
 duusari ghatana he sanskrit vyakaran seekhney main utsaahpurvak lage ek vyakti ke prati shankar kii pratikriya
 After watching him try to memorize the rules of grammar aloud and memorize it, Shankar composed one of his most popular mantras, Bhaj Govindam, at the same moment, in which the last line of each verse It is said: 'worship Govind, worship Govind, worship Govind, o infatuated! Because at the time of death the rules of grammar cannot help you! 'as an example of devotional mantras, Bhaj Govindam occupies a very high place, and is still sung throughout India
 ye dikhaata he ki shankar kaa vishwaas masini gyaan main nahin tha, or wo gyaan maarg ke prayog kii jarurat par jor dete the
 He used to emphasize that such knowledge should be acquired which would explain the ephemerality of the mortal world, which we give more importance to, and show the path to salvation
 teesri ghatana ek vaad-vivaad ke bare main he jo brahm sutara kii vyakhya ko lekar ek vruddh vyakti ke saath hua tha
 The debates lasted for about a week, and neither of the two participants was willing to give up, and, as i saw in a brief lecture at the Sanskrit University, the debate certainly contained a burst of anger, sarcasm and bitterness
 Must have been kahani ke anusaar, ant main shankar ke shishy padmapad ne vishnu se aagrah kiya ki is bahes ko samaapt karen
 Eventually it came to light, as claimed in traditional biographies, that the old man was an incarnation of Vyasa, the author of the Brahma Sutra
 ye ghatana sambhawatah is tathy ko darshaati he ki vedant sutara par shankar kii vyakhya ke upar kaaphi bahes hoti thi, or shaayad unhen kabhi-kabhi apane puraane mat ko tyagkar pratidwandvi kii baat ko sweekaar karnaa padataa tha
 Here the old man can be such a rival, which Shankar did not find it easy to satisfy and his knowledge of the literature of Vedanta philosophy is so vast that he is seen as an avatar of Vyasa

 krishnasami ayyar, shri shankaracharya, hij life and times, ji
 a
 natesan and company, chennai, tithi agyaat, prishth 28-29 ]kaashi main kai varsh bitaane ke baad, jis dauraan wo kabhi-kabhi badrinaath yatra par jate the, shankar prayag (aaj kaa elahabaad) gaye
 It is said that the then ruler of Benares, Ratan Singh, tried to persuade him to stay here, but Shankar told him that his goal was to become a wandering teacher and spread his philosophical outlook to all parts of India
 prayag main unhone sangam main snaan kiya, jo ganga, yamuna or puranic saraswati kaa pavitra mail he
 However, his visit to Prayag is most remembered for his meeting with Kumaril Bhatt, the formidable Brahmin of Assam, and one of the great exponents of former philosophies of Hindu philosophy
 is mimasaa ke anuyaayi maanate the ki jivan kaa mukhya lakshya karmkand he
 Shankar, who believed in the validity of the Enlightenment path, disagreed with such an emphasis on practices, and was inclined to debate this opinion with Bhatt
 naatakeey kaarnon se unhen ye avasar nahin mil sakaa
 When he met Kumaril Bhatt, this revered scholar was lying on a burning pile of rice bran during the process of self-immolation
 unhone ye bhayanak kadam un do paapon kaa praayshchit karne ke liye uthaaya tha jo unke anusaar unhone kiye the
 First, to demolish some of the principles of Buddhism, he was educated as a pseudo-disciple in a Buddhist monastery so that he could master the principles he wanted to cut
 baad main, wo buddha darshan ke sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee aalochak bane jise iske baad ke siddhantkaron ne pratipaadit kiya tha
 But during this process, he had to live with the guilt of 'cheating' his master, under whose feet he had studied
 is dhokhadhadi ke liye praayshchit kii jarurat thi
 Secondly, he also denied the existence of God to propound ritual rituals
 unka maananaa tha ki isse unka darshan asweekaarya charam par ja rahaa tha
 It is said that Shankar tried to convince Bhatt to give up his resolve to commit self-immolation, but he was adamant
 aadhe jaale sharir ke saath wo shankar ke saath vaad-vivaad karne kii sthiti main nahin the
 But while he was giving up his life, he told Shankar that he should make a discussion with his disciple Mandan Mishra, who lives in Mahishmati
 kai itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki shankar kii bhatta ke saath naatakeey bhent sachai se adhik kalpana he
 Presumably, Bhatt's life span was the second half of the seventh century AD, and therefore he was not contemporary with Shankar
 phir bhi, is bhent ko paaramparik rup se is tarah sthapit kiya gaya he, ki iskaa uddeshy nishchit rup se is tathy ko saamne laana hoga ki purv mimasaa main bataai gayi prathaon or gyaan aadhaarit advait kii bhinnataayen dur-dur tak fail chuki thim or in par jamkar vaad-vivaad hote the
 The most important exponents of former epistemology were Kumaril Bhatt and Shankar of Advaita, so both of them needed to be presented
 ye bhi sach he ki wo donon lagbhag samakaleen the, isliye baad ke jeevanikaron ne bina kalkram yaa sahi tithiyon kii chintaa kiye, aitihaasik tathy ko kaalpanik pratikwaad se dhak diya
 Shastraartha, along with Mandan Mishra, holds an important place in all the episodes of his life, following the advice of Kumaril Bhatt, whom Shankar went to Mahishmati to meet
 mahishmati kahaan he, ise lekar raay kaaphi banty hui he
 According to several accounts, including Madhvacharya's Shankar Digvijayam, Mandan Mishra belonged to a Mahishi village on the banks of Kosi in today's Saharsa district of Bihar
 is gaanv main aaj bhi aise parivaar hai jo daawa karte hai ki wo mandan mishra ke vanshaj hai
 According to the belief of the residents here, Mandan Mishra married Kumaril Bhatt's sister, Sharda Bharti, who belonged to Bhattpura village in Mithila region of Bihar
 iske vipareet, is drushtikon ke bhi utane hi kattar samarthak hai ki mahishmati narmada ke tat par aaj ke maheshwar ke paas ek samrajya tha
 And, while traveling in the region, i found at least three places which claim that Shankar and Mandan Mishra had a famous debate at this place
 inamen sabase pramukh he mandaleshwar (jo mahishmati kaa nayaa naam mana jaataa he) main ek mandir, jo maheshwar shahar se bilkul najadik he
 a giant in large letters is inscribed on the gate: 'sri Gupteshwar Mahadev (cave) temple'
 is dwaar ke dahini ore ek diwaar par trivimi bhitti-chitra he jisamen shankar, mandan mishra or bharti devi kii pratimaayein dikhaai gai hai, or saath main ek board he jis par likhaa he ki yaheen donon vidwaanon ke bich prasiddh shastrarth hua tha
 The temple and its premises looked completely deserted
 vahaan koi aadmi tak nahin dikh rahaa tha, yahaan tak ki mandir kaa pujari bhi nahin
 There was a chaotic garden around the temple with no fence
 mandir kii diwaar par ek or notice board tha jis par likhaa tha: aaj se 1200 varsh pehle shiv avatar aadi shankaracharya tathaa digvijay maha pandit brahm avatar mandan mishra ke saath sanathan dharm sansthaapan va vishwa kalyaan ke liye shastrarth, yaheen shri gupteshwar mandir se 100 gaj dur sthit sthaan par hua tha
 There was indeed an open space about 100 yards away from the temple where there was a shade of sycamore and banyan trees, but on what basis could the temple management say with confidence that it was the real place of debate, it is not clear
 jab ham is prashn ke saath jujh rahe the, mandir kaa pujari aakhirkaar hamen dikh gaya
 According to him, Kolkata Maha Milan Math did research on this subject
 1984 main, math ke tatkaaleen pramukh, premanand kishor mandaleshwar aae or us sthaan par ye mandir banwaaya jahaan unka vishwaas tha ki shastrarth hua tha
 The priest was unable to give evidence in support of this research, nor could we get it from the monastery
 haalanki, pujari ne spasht kiya ki ye sthaan pehle narmada ke tat par hua karata tha, or aaj nadi thodi dur chali gai he, lekin monsoon main iskaa pani is sthaan tak aa jaataa he
 There are at least two more places in the region that claim to have been famous for the same
 ek maheshwar main he, or narmada ke kinare holkar shaskaon ke banaae aaleeshaan kile se adhik dur nahin he
 There is only a small platform on which Shivling and Paduka are built
 doosraa sthaan bhi maheshwar main hi he, lekin kile se thodi duuri par or adhik prabhaavshaalee he
 It is called Kadamba Forest, although i do not see any Kadamba tree except bananas
 mandir main ek pattica he jis par daawa kiya gaya he ki isi kshetra main shastrarth hua tha
 The upper part of the plaque has paintings of Shankaracharya, Mandan Mishra, and Sharda Bharti
 mandir kii deevaaron par bhi bade-bade chitra hai jinamein shastrarth hota dikhaaya gaya he
 In the largest of these pictures, Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra are sitting opposite each other on small machines in a pose of debate, Sharda Bharti is watching them and a large number of spectators are present in the background
 in sthalon ke aapasi daavon kii jo bhi vaidhata ho, ye apane aap main sach he ki ye sabhi maheshwar shahar or kuch kilometre dur iske upnagar mandaleshwar ke kshetra main hai
 There is also no doubt that Mahishmati was an important ancient city in central India, now Madhya Pradesh
 aitihaasik pustakon main bataaya gaya he ki ye pracheen avanti or anup samrajyon kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn shahar tha, or parmaar vansh ke shasankaal main bhi faltaa-phulataa shahari centre bana rahaa jab tak ki 1305 isvi main allaudin khilji ne ise parrast nahin kar diya
 In some places there is evidence that Mahishmati was situated on the banks of the Narmada, with Ujjayini in the south and establishment in the north
 yahi wo sthaan he, jahaan aaj maheshwar or mandaleshwar sthit hai
 Therefore, it seems likely that Mahishmati, the place of Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra, could be where Maheshwar and Mandleshwar are today
 kam se kam, jo log yahaan rahete hai wo is baat par puraa bharosa karte hai
 However, we also cannot completely reject the viewpoint that describes Mahishi in Saharsa district of Bihar
 yahaan ke nivasee bhi mandan mishra par apana daawa puure damakham ke saath karte hai
 Our job is not to judge two contrary claims of history to be true or false, both of which have no firm evidence to support them
 itihaas ke drushtikon se, bich kaa rasta ye ho saktaa he ki mandan mishra bihar se aate hon, or vahaan mahishi gaanv main unka janm hua ho, or baad main wo madhya bharat ke mahishmati shahar main bas gaye hon
 It can be believed that because Mahishmati was a big and famous city, there was a court, and could provide a suitable platform to a distinguished scholar like him as the chief pundit of the court
 mahatvapurn rup se, madhav ke shankar digvijaym ke aathven adhyay main kaha gaya he ki shastrarth reva nadi ke tat par hua tha, jo narmada kaa hi doosraa naam he
 However, all things of Shankar Digvijayam cannot be said to be historically correct
 sthaan chaahe jo bhi ho, in donon vidwaanon ke bich mahaan shastrarth ke moulik vivaranon main acchhee-khaasi naatakeeyata he, jiskaa kaaran he bhakt jeevanikaron dwaara kiya gaya bhavuk or alankrita varnan
 Burning on the pyre, on Shankar's question as to where he would find Mandan Mishra in Mahishmati, Kumaril Bhatt replied: 'you will find a house in which parrots hang in cages at the doors, discussing such esoteric subjects It must have been, "are the Vedas self-respecting or are they dependent on any external influence for this?" Do the deeds result directly or does God have to intervene for that? Is the world eternal or just a misnomer? " Where you find parrots discussing such complex philosophical topics, you will understand that this is the house of worship '
 jab shankar ne mandan ke ghar main pravesh kiya, to wo shankar ko dekhakar prasann nahin hue
 He was busy with his father's death anniversary practices, Shraddha and the appearance of a celibate monk was inauspicious according to his beliefs
 unka maananaa tha ki sahi tarika yahi he ki aap ek grihasth jivan jien or nirdhaarit vaidic prathaon kaa paalan karen
 Not only this, his behavior was rude to Shankar, though Shankar did not deviate from it, and in the end decided that the debate between the two scholars would begin the next day
 mandan mishra ne shankar ko ek madhyasth chunane ko kaha, lekin tab aashcharyachakit rah gaye jab unhone kaha ki mandan kii patni ubhaya bharti (sharada devi) madhyasth ho sakati hai
 [many scholars differ on whether Bharati was the wife of Mandan Mishra, but according to most scholars and folk beliefs, she was the wife of Mandan Mishra, so we leave this dispute here
 ]wo vidhushi is cheez ke liye raji ho gai, or donon pratibhaagiyon ke gale main phulon kii maala daal di, saath hi ye ghoshnaa kar di ki jisaki maala pehle murajhaayegi wo parajeet mana jayega
 It was also decided that whoever loses, he will follow his rival, and will follow the rules of his life
 is ghatana ke alag-alag varnanon ke anusaar, donon ke bich shastrarth satraa dinon se lekar chah maheene kii kisi avadhi tak chalata rahaa
 Finally, the necklace of Mandan Mishra's neck began to wither, and it was clear that Shankar had conquered the scriptures
 lekin ubhaya bharti paraajay sweekaar karne ko raji nahin thim
 He said that as the wife of Mishra, she is his ardhangini, and is also recognized as bisexual Ardhanarishwara in Hinduism
 isliye, wo bhi shankar ke saath shastrarth karnaa chaahati thim
 Shankar did not want to do this, because it was not allowed for a monk to talk to a woman
 lekin ubhaya bharti ne isaki jid pakad lee thi, or shankar ke paas hami bharne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 Here we get the most interesting twist of this story
 ubhaya bharti ne shankar se kaam shaastra par prashn puche jo kaam-sukh or yon sambandhon se jude the, or jinase wo ek vivaahit stri hone ke kaaran parichit thim, lekin unka pratidwandvi ek sanyasi hone ke kaaran bilkul anjaan tha
 Shankar then asked for a month's delay to learn about this 'science', and then asked for a return to the scriptures, on which Ubhaya Bharati agreed
 kahani ke anusaar shankar ne apni yogic shaktiyon ke dwaara, apane sharir ko narmada ke tat par ek gupha main chhod diya, or raja amaruuk ke mrit sharir main pravesh kar gaye, jise antim sanskaar ke liye le jaaya ja rahaa tha
 By the way, this cave, which was known as Gupteshwar Cave, is still found in Gupteshwar Temple in Mandleshwar
 ye mandir ke neeche he, or vahaan tak sidhiyon se pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The cave is extremely tight, has no decoration on its rocky walls, and has white tiles on the floor
 andar ekmaatr murti he pathar kii ek yoni jiske bich main tambe kaa ek bada sa saanp bana he
 The resurrection of the king was considered a miracle, and Shankar walked into the palace in the body of the dead ruler
 vahaan, mrit raja kii patniyon kii sangati main, unhone ratikriya kii kalaayen sikhin, or kaam shaastra main nipun ho gaye
 And as his biographer says, Shankar was so immersed in his new life and the luxury of the palace that he forgot that he had to restore his body in the cave within a month
 isse unke shishy bahut chintit ho gaye, or ye yaad dilaane ke liye ki wo vastav main koun hai, unke saamne kuch darshanik geet gaae
 Then Shankar woke up with his poisoned prick, and quickly re-entered his body, and at exactly one occasion he did so, as the body was discovered by the king's attendants after being kept in the cave for a month and his right - Were communicators
 kaam shaastra main maharath hasil karne ke baad, wo mahishmati laute or ubhaya bharti ke prashnon ke safaltaapurvak uttar die
 He won in the debate
 mandan mishra ne sanyasiyon vaale vastra dhaaran kiye or wo shankar ke shishy ban gaye
 Bharti did the same on Shankar's persuasion
 is mahatvapurn kahani kaa moolyankan chhitput jeevanikaron dwaara baad main jode gaye rang-birange vivaranon se pare kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Scripture was actually a symbol of the idea that ideas are more important than customs, and that happened at a time when the opposite was becoming an acceptable way of life for Hindus
 isi kaaran is kahani ko shankar ke jivan kaa itnaa mahatvapurn hissaa bataaya jaataa he
 The revival of Hindutva took place in the sixth and seventh centuries and in comparison the decline of Buddhism
 haalanki ye punarotthana puranic kathaon, andh bhakthi, or isse bhi adhik, kumaril bhatta jaise mimasakon dwaara sthapit vaidic prathaon ke anusaran par bahut adhik kendrit tha
 Somewhere, in all these, the importance of ideas was being left behind which was the fundamental basis of Hindu vision
 vaidic niyam-kaayadon ke anusaar bilkul sateek prathaon kaa paalan karne ke liye, upanishdon kii mahimapurna aadhyatmik antardrushti ko bhulaayaa ja rahaa tha
 The temples were thriving, but there was disconnection between the methods of worship and the philosophical thinking behind it
 ek baar phir jarurat thi moksh ke liye gyaan maarg par jor dene kii, hindutv ko phir se isaki aadhyatmik antardrushti se jodne kii, or manan-chintan kii mahatta ko phir se saamne laane kii
 This was the direct goal of Shankar, and there could be no better metaphor than defeating Mandan Mishra in a debate to propagate it
 mahishi kaa ye pratishthit pandit ek durjey pratidwandvi tha, or uske samarthak use swayan brahma kaa avatar maanate the
 He was undoubtedly the most famous disciple of Kumaril Bhatt, and the author of many original works on Mimamsa such as Mimamsanukramanika, bhavana-vivek and vidhi-vivek
 iske alaava unhone bhashaa kii darshaniktaa par ek mahatvapurn rachana likhi sphot siddhi, or bhram ke siddhanton par pustak likhi vibhram-vivek
 Hence his defeat with Shankar in the scriptures deeply influenced the beliefs and traditions of Hindutva across India
 sanchaar ke aadhunik sadhano ke bina bhi, shastrarth kii pragati ko or tarkon kii baarikiyon ko hajaaron logon ne dekha, or phir desh bhar main hajaaron or logon tak ye ek-duusare se baatcheet ke madhyam se pahunchaa
 When we look at this debate in the historical perspective of the development of Hindutva, its importance increases further, and that is why it has been given a prominent place in every description of Shankar's life
 shankar kaa kaam shaastra kaa gyaan hasil karne kii ghatana dilachasp he
 Did this actually happen, or was it added to bring out the broader philosophy of Hindutva? Rationalists would not accept the claim that Shankar left his body and entered another's body through compound powers
 duusare kahenge ki yogic siddhiyon kaa abhyaas karne vaale aisi shaktiyon se anbhigya nahin rahete
 However, the basic question is why did Ubhaya Bharati test Shankar on the topics of sexuality, and why did Shankar accept this challenge? For a monk, sexuality was like bliss, and was done for a lifetime
 Violation of vows also
 isse bhi adhik dilachasp ye he ki shankar ke jeevanikaron ne sweekaar kiya he ki, mrit raja kii raniyon ke saath or mahal ke aishwaryapurna jivan main, shankar itane aasakt ho gaye the ki apni sanyas kii pratigya tak bhul gaye the or kaam-sahitya par amaruuk shatak naam se ek niyamavali tak likh daali
 Why would he do this, and does it not cause a depletion of a high-level personality beyond his physical comforts? According to me, the answer is that the purpose of this event was to prove the validity of the four efforts in Hindu philosophy: religion, meaning, Kama and Moksha
 kaam sutara ke lekhak vatsayayan ne shankar ke sadiyon pehle bataaya tha ki pehle teenon purushaarthon kaa sahi anupaat main paalan karne se swatah chauthe purusharth, moksh kaa rasta khul jaataa he
 In other words, work has philosophical validity in the framework of a balanced life
 shankar ne ek sanyasi kaa jivan chunaa ho saktaa tha, jahaan arth or kaam kii koi jagah nahin thi, lekin is kaaran aam logon ke liye inaki praasangikta ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, it was necessary that Shankara's personal desire to renounce celibacy and worldly pleasures should not be presented in the broader Hindu philosophy, as opposed to the recognition of these two efforts
 ek grihasth kaa jivan jikar, shankar ne ek sanyasi kii apni chhavi ko kamatar nahin kiya, balki apane darshan ke aakarshan or pahunch ko brahmacharee sanyasiyon ke simit daayre se nikaalkar vyapak rup diya
 Mandan Mishra became one of the four most important disciples of Shankaracharya, and (although some scholars do not agree on this point) assumed the new name Suresvaracharya
 wo advait siddhant ke pratishthit vidwaan hue, or unhen is vishay par paini drushti vaali ek pustak brahmasiddhi kaa rachayita hone kaa shrey bhi miltaa he
 It is believed that Shankar made him the first head of the Sringeri Math, although the Kanchi Math also claims the same
 ubhaya bharti, jinhen devi saraswati kaa avatar mana jaataa tha, shankar or apane pati ke saath shringery gayi, jahaan unki mrityu ho gai
 Shankar built a temple in the city in his honor, which still exists today
 ek myne main, wo shankar ke darshan main shakti siddhant kii kendriya bhoomika kaa pratinidhitiv karti thim

 " sara ali khan or sushant singh rajput starer film 'kedarnath' kaa trailor jab launch hua tha to internet par chaa gaya tha
 There was talk of trailer everywhere
 uske baad se phens besabri se film kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 When the film was released, it was at the box office
 haalanki, film ko kharaab rivyuu mili, lekin abhinay kii taareef hui
 In the second week too, Kedarnath rests at the box office
 mana ja rahaa he ki film kii kamai jari rahegi
 According to trade reports, Kedarnath, directed by Abhishek Kapoor, has collected 3 crores on the ticket window this Thursday
 vahiin buudhvaar ko film ne 3
 25 crores
 mangalvaar ko film ne 3
 75 crores
 trade analist taran adarsh ke mutabik, film ne pehle din yani shuukravaar ko 7
 25 crores, 9 on Saturday
 75 karod, ravivaar ko 10
 75 crores, 4 on Monday
 25 karod rupee kamaaye
 The film grossed 32 crores in the first four days in the Indian market
 bhartiya bazaar main ab tak film ne kareeb 42 karod rupee kama liye hai
 However, in the first week, the film missed out on earning Rs 50 crore
 ise hit bataaya ja rahaa he
 The film cost around 35 crores
 kuch reports main laagat 55 karod se zyada bataaya ja rahaa he
 What is the story of the film? The story of the film is Lovestory which is woven at the center of the tragedy of Kedarnath
 kedarnathki kahani ek hindu pandit kii beti mandakini urf mukku (sara ali khan) se shuru hoti he jo kii behad ziddee, khushmizaaz or alhad hai
 Mukku falls in love with Mansoor (sushant Singh Rajput), a Muslim pittu (shoulder of pilgrims)

 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ke bich jubaani jang tej hoti ja rahi he
 Since what Nitish Kumar addressed Tejashwi as a child during a conversation with journalists on Monday, Tejashwi Yadav has been continuously aggressive since then
 nitish kumaar ne tejasvi ke liye kaha ki unke andar unke pita lalu prasad yadav kaa swabhaav he, isi kaa jawaab dete hue tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki unhen garv he ki unke andar unke pita kaa swabhaav he or chaaya kaaya najar aati he magar tejasvi ne nitish kumaar se sawaal poocha ki kya nitish dil par haath rakh kar kah sakate hai ki unke bete main unka swabhaav he?twitor ke jariye nitish kumaar parahamala bolte hue tejasvi yadavane kaha ki vah raajnneeti ko nitish kumaar kii tarah nakaaratmakataa ke nimna str par nahin le janaa chaahate hai lekin sachai se nitish kumaar ko bahut parichit hai or unhen raaj ko raaj hi rahane dena chahie!aadarneey nitish ji, mujhe garv he ki mujhamen mere pita kaa swabhaav he
 But tell me with your hands on your heart, is your nature in your son? No fuss straight talk

 Let the kingdom remain the secret

 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar, like Sushil Modi, wants to take his place by talking low level
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumarrajnneetik or vaicharik strapar unka virodh nahin kar sakate kyonki unka apana koi vichaar, niti, siddhant or usul nahin bachaa he isiilie vah lalu or unke parivaar ke khilaaf ko ochhi vyaktigat tippanee par utar gaye hai
 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar did not survive any such party in Bihar that did not have an alliance
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne aaj tak apane dam par naa sarkaar bana paae hai naa banaaenge
 Tejashwi said that the Janadharto of the Rashtriya Janata Dal is at the feet of Angad, the stronger it is, the stronger it will be but it will not hurt
 navazuddin siddiki kii film 'thakare' kaa box offis collection behtareen rahaa
 The film has damaged Kangana's 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi'
 abhijit paanse ke nirdesan main bani thakare ne pehle din 6 karod kaa bijness kiya he, jabaki manikarnika ne 8
 75 crores
 bataa den ki thakare ke box offis par 2
 75 to 3 crores and Manikarnika was expected to earn 13-15 crores
 manikarnika ko bade paimaane par relies kiya gaya he
 The film was released on 3000 screens in India and 700 screens abroad, while Thackeray was released on just 1300 screens and 400-500 screens in overseas
 is lihaaj se box offis par thakare ne manikarnika kaa khel bigaada he or nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 Obviously, in the coming times, Thackeray will give a tough fight to Manikarnika
 thakare ke manikarnika ko nuksaan pahunchane ke peeche kai vajah he
 Earlier we had told how Thackeray can spoil the game of Manikarnika
 or hamaari ashanka sach sabit hui
 Thackeray's earnings in Mumbai circuit are generally the highest grosser of film in Mumbai circuit
 ranvir singh kii simba or yash kii KGF ne bhi isi circuit se sabase zyada kamai kii thi
 And Bal Thackeray is remembered as a leader voicing the rights of Marathi people
 maharashtra main log unhen hero maanate hai
 In such a situation, Thackeray has benefited greatly from this circuit

 # Hindi # Marathi — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) January 26, 2019 Nawaz's acting also benefited Nawazuddin Siddiqui playing Bal Thackeray in the film
 film main wo bilkul bal thakare kii tarah lag rahe hai
 His look and performance brought people to theaters
 hindutv kaa doseis baat ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki bal thakare kaa vivaadon se gaharaa naata rahaa he
 He is considered the face of Hindutva
 film main bhi kai vivaadon ko dikhaaya gaya he
 In the film, issues related to Pakistan and Babri Masjid have been given place
 aise main maharashtra ke alaava upi-bihar jaise hindi belt se bhi film ko phayda mila
 Dengue and chikungunya continue to wreak havoc and elections are due next year
 jahaan ek taraf emsidi karmchaariyon kii kami se jujh rahi he vahiin voton ke liye parshadon ne hi jimmaa sambhaal liya he
 BJP councilor from New Ashok Nagar in Delhi came out with complete settlement to kill Nikki Singh Machro
 vaise ye kaam emsidi kaa karmchaariyon kaa he lekin jab karmchaaree hi nahin to phir parshad sahiba khud hi nikal padi machharon ko maarane
 The path of MCD is difficult because 21 posts of Malaria Inspector are vacant in Shahdara Zone of EDMC, while 27 out of 34 posts are vacant in Shahdara North Zone
 parshadon kii mushkil he ki 50 ke paar vaale karmchaariyon se kaam kaise len
 On Friday, the meeting of the Standing Committee of EDMC also took place between BJP Councilor Dipti Joshi and Chairman
 bhale hi upree taur par sabakuch thik dikhaaya ja rahaa ho lekin janata ke gusse kaa saamana koun kare aise main parshad khud hi apane logon ke saath maidan par utar pade hai
 So the MCD is blaming the Delhi government for this
 sabase mushkil or khaufnak baat ye he ki dengue se lekar chikangunia or jika tak failaane vaala machhar ek hi hai
 Therefore, mosquito is not going to stop by just giving treatment to the sick in Delhi

 pani aise aa rahaa tha maano kaale rang kaa koi saanp fan uthaae badi teji se chalaa aa rahaa ho
 On seeing him, i took my two children together and ran to the second floor of the guest house close to the temple
 iske chand second baad hi lagbhag puraa kedarnath dham tabah ho chukaa tha
 "it is an unbelievable nightmare for Yudhveer, a sevadar of the Kedarnath Temple at an altitude of twelve thousand feet above sea level
 yudhvir un chand logon main hai, jo ab bhi kedarnath main tike hue hai
 The religious settlement in Kedarnath, where about 10,000 people used to spend the night at a time in the pilgrimage season, is now in deep silence
 raat main vahaan mandir kaa staff or kuch sarkari karmchaariyon ke alaava koi nahin tikta
 The nearest human settlement is two kilometers from here, where the Uttarakhand government has installed 10 tents in the open ground
 vahaan ek samay main sirf 100 log thahar sakate hai
 Most of these tents also have government employees
 barish hone par yahaan raat kaa taapmaana shunya degree tak chalaa jaataa he
 Overall, Kedarnath is a deserted crematorium, where people think that the corpses will come out whenever they remove mud or stone
 hafte bhar pehle hi yahaan se aath laashen nikali hai
 Due to the cold, these dead bodies were found in good condition
 yahaan kitne log mare, iske bare main sirf anumaan hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Sejwan, the man who runs the hotel in Rambara on the road, says that 700 people stayed in my hotel that night
 us jal pralay ke baad shaayad hi koi bachaa
 Rambara is now a heap of rocks, from which the Mandakini river is flowing in the form of a rasra
 yahaan pehle 100 se zyada dukaane or paanch bade hotel or kai dharmashalaayein thim, kedarnath kii paidal yatra pehle gaurikund se shuru hoti thi or rambada yatra kaa pramukh padaav tha
 Where once there was beauty, now there are piles of human bones and torn clothes
 jo khachchar yahaan yatriyon ko dhone main jute rahete the, unamem se zyaadaatar maare ja chuke hai or baaki bache khachchar gaurikund ke neeche laavaaris gum rahe hai
 The walking tour of Kedarnath now starts from Sonprayag
 kul yatra maarg ab pehle ke 14 kilometre se badhkar 24 kilometre kaa ho chukaa he
 This was an old route, which has been commissioned
 lekin is maarg kaa rambada ke baad kaa lagbhag 10 kilometre kaa hissaa behad kathin or durgam he or sirf swasth or jawan logon ke liye hi is maarg ko puraa kar paanaa sambhav he
 The effect of this is that the journey on which 10,000 passengers used to come every day, now only 15 people are coming there every day
 is yatra maarg main junglee bhaaluon ke hamale kaa khatra bhi he
 This writer also found a bear on the way
 kaaphi neeche sonprayag ke paas phata se helicopter se kedarnath pahunchaa ja saktaa he, lekin yahaan kaa kiraaya pehle 7,500 ru
 Doubled from Rs
 15,500 to Rs
 kar diya gaya he
 Anyway, two choppers falling on the journey route are enough to break the spirits of any passenger
 haalanki in helicopteron ke darshan usee tarah kiye jate hai, jis tarah mandiron kaa hota he
 The new travel route to Kedarnath has medical facilities in the name of government settlement and the route has been decorated with white lime-painted stones
 iske alaava abhi khaane or thaharne kii suvidhaayen na ke baraabar hai
 Currently, the passengers are registered at five places and on any given day, not more than 100 passengers are left
 inamen sthaneey dukandaar or majdoor bhi shaamil hai
 The stones in the path are loose and feet do not slip so that you will be in cold water depositing the bones of Mandakini, where death is almost certain
 is maarg se ve basen or shandaar gadibhan najar aati hai, jo puraane maarg par funs gai thim or jinhen ab shaayad kabhi nikaala nahin ja sakegaa
 PWD engineer Lalit Mohan Negi says, "when the snow of these winters melts, the existing temporary route will have been washed away
" ” yani 2014 main nae sire se yatra kii taiyaari kerani hogi or isamen samay lagegaa
 The locals here are in a strange mental state, the rush of travelers coming to Kedarnath was a means of employment for them, but after the devastation this time they feel that nature was tortured here
 nadi ne kisi kaa kuch nahin bigaada
 He only regained the path he had been in for thousands of years
 nadi ke paat main bane hotel or dukaane tathaa ghar sirf is vajah se tabah ho gaye kyonki nadi ne apni paat main bahane kaa haq us ek raat ke liye hasil kar liya tha
 There is now only sand left in Gandhi Sarovar, located three kilometers from here, which wreaked havoc in Kedarnath Dham
 vahaan kaa sara pani 16-17 june ke bich vaali raat ko sirf teen minute main tabaahi machaata hua bah gaya tha
 This water came out after Kedarnath from Rambada, Gaurikund, Sonprayag, Rudraprayag and went downhill
 kedarnath kii traasadee main tirthayatriyon kii pidaa kaa to kaaphi khyaal rakhaa ja chukaa he
 But the local people have also gone through such a big tragedy
 misaal ke taur par yahaan ke lamgaadi gaanv main ab sirf auraten or bachche najar aate hai
 You can call it the village of widows
 yahaan ke 64 se zyada purush us kaal ke gaal main samaa gaye
 All these people worked in Gaurkund and Rambara for wages or small jobs
 yahaan kii ek mahila us raat ko yaad karte hue kahati hai ki bacchon kii vajah se unhen jeena padegaa
 However, the government paid Rs 5 lakh per family as compensation here
 die hai
 Sreejayesh, a psychologist who has come for counseling in this area, says, "their life will not be able to come with these money, because they do not know what to do with these money
 ”duniya ko dikhaane ke liye sarkaar ne beshak 4 aktubar se yatra phir se shuru hone kii ghoshnaa kar di he, lekin kedarnath kaa maujuuda haal yatra ke anukool nahin he
 No building remained safe here
 mandir ko kaaphi nuksaan hua he
 The foundation stones are shaken
 bain ore ke daravaaje ke saare pathar nikal chuke hai or vahaan asthaayee rup se pathar tikaa die gaye hai
 The matter of not damaging the temple alone is hollow because many buildings near the temple are also standing with almost the same amount of damage
 mandir ke peeche ek bada sa pathar aa tikaa he, jise daivi maanakar uski bhi puja shuru ho chuki he
 Kedarnath, who had seen the rage of Shiva, the god of destruction, is still suffering his wounds
 ab vakt hi un par maraham laga saktaa he
 It may take up to five years, when the old charm of the Tartha Yatra here will be able to return
 tab tak zyaadaatar tirthayatriyon ke liye chaar dham yatra teen dham yani badrinaath, yamunotri or gangotri kii yatra banakar rah jaaegi

 ) melbern cricket stadium ne cricket itihaas ke naa jane kitne aitihaasik or yaadgaar lamhon ko dekha hoga
 But on 30 December, it settled in jarre-jarre
 ye koi aam cricket match nahin tha
 But it was not known to any player of team India and to the host team
 bas team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ke sivaa
 Captain number one Dhoni said the white jersey bye When Dhoni was returning to the pavilion after playing the last ball in this Melbourne ground, he was very normal
 haalanki tab tak dhoni ne kai record apane naam kar liye
 Became the most stumping wicketkeeper
 test, vanade or tii-20 milakar tino formet main das hajaar se zyada ran banane vaale captain ban gaye
 But what Dhoni would have celebrated after winning the World Cup, how cool would he celebrate these successes
 sach to ye he ki dhoni ke jehan main kuch or ghumad rahaa tha
 Something that was going to bring the biggest earthquake in Team India's cricket history
 ye ehsaas kisi ko nahin tha ki ab safed jersey kaa chola dhoni utaar chuke hai or melbern kaa ye stadium is lihaaj se itihaas main darj ho gaya ki hindustan ke sabase kaamyaab captain ne test kaa balla yaheen par chhod diya
 Team India was breathing a sigh of relief that we had survived the defeat
 lekin dhoni ke dilodimag main badi uthal puthal machi thi
 Although he looked absolutely normal from above
 usee vakt dressing rum main dhoni ne bisisiai ke sachiv sanjay patel ko phone laga diya
 dhoni-sanjay, i am speaking Dhoni
 
 
 kaise hai aap
 
 
 Sanjay - I'm good
 
 
 achaanak aapane phone kyon kiya
 
 dhoni-maine test kii captaini chhodane kaa man bana liya he
 
 
 Sanjay - Hey
 
 
 aisa kya hua, jo itnaa bada faisla aapane le liya
 
 
 Dhoni - Not only this, i am also going to retire from the test
 
 
 sanjay-kya hua dhoni
 
 
 Are you injured or is there anything else 
 
 dhoni-nahin, maine faisla kiya he to kuch soch samajhakar kiya he
 
 
 Sanjay - Okay
