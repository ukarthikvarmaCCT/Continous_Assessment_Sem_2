) Shia Central Waqf Board Chairman, Waseem Rizveen has made a shocking statement about a Firbabari mosque
 wasim rizvi ne musalamaanon se samjhaute ke mej par baithkar ise hinduon ko saunpane kii vakaalat kii he
 Wasim Rizvi said that calling the stigma a mosque is a crime because the digging under the mosque was done by 137 laborers, including 52 Muslims
 us khudaai ke dauraan 50mandirke stambhon ke neeche ke bhaag main eenton kaa banaaya gaya chabutara bhi mila tha
 He claimed that a total of 265 old relics belonging to the temple were found during the excavation
 isi ke aadhaar par bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag (eesai) is nirnay par pahunchaa tha ki upree sataha par bani babari masjid ke neeche ek mandir dabaa hua he
 It is to be believed that Babri is built on the rubble of these temples
 babari masjidka nirmaan tode gaye mandiron ke malbe par banaae jane ko lekar rizvi ne kaha ki iskaa ullekh keke mohammad kii kitaab 'main bhartiya hum' main bhi kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, calling that Babri stigma a legitimate mosque is contrary to Islamic principles
 unhone aage kaha ki abhi bhi vakt he log babari masjid se juden, apane gunahon kii tauba karen or hazrat mohammad ke islam ko maane
 Terrorist Abu Bakr, leave the ideology of Omar and return the right of Ram to Hindus without winning defeat by sitting at the table of an agreement and take the initiative to build a new Aman mosque with proper money in Lucknow
 Before this, the Central Board Chairman Wasim Rizveepooja (special provision) ) Has sought to abolish the Act-1991
 rizvi ke mutabik, puja sthal (vishesh praavdhaan) adhinium ke tahat vivaadit masjiden surakshit kii ja chuki hai
 It will be difficult to hand them over to the Hindus, so eliminate it
 rizvi ne is act ko khatm karne ke saath-saath un 9 masjidon ko jinhen mughal kaal main mandiron ko todakar banaaya gaya tha, jisamen ayodhya, kaashi, mathura, qutub minar, sahit kul 9 masjiden bani hai
 They have demanded to hand them back to the Hindus
 unki yah bhi maang kii he ki ek special cameti banaakar adaalat kii nigaraanee main vivaadit masjidon ke bare main thik-thik jaankaree di jaae
 If it is proved that it has been built by breaking the shrines of Hindus, then they should be returned to Hindus
 rizviyaha tak kah chuke hai ki ayodhya main us jagah par kabhi masjid nahin thi or vahaan kabhi masjid nahin ho sakati he
 It is the birthplace of Lord Rama and only the Ram temple will be built there

 Just three weeks ago, Aamir Khan cut his birthday cake
 logicli, unke kek par the puure 50 candles
 Even then, Aamir believes that he is 24 years old
 or yahi vajah he ki industry main koi unhen hero nahin samajhataa he
 According to Aamir, people still consider him to be a chocolate boy
 aamir se jab ye poocha gaya ki unhen pehali baar hero kab kaha gaya, tab unhone kaha, 'kisi ne mujhe hero nahin kaha
 i still do not call people heroes
 sabhi mujhe chocolate bvoy kehete hai'
 Now this is probably the reason why Janab has told himself his age is only 24 years
 or 48 saal ke salmaan khan ko 'noujvaan' kaa tamgaa de diya he
 Actually, Aamir Khan, who reached the trailer launch of Jackie Shroff's son Tiger Shroff's film 'heropanti', was asked how he is feeling after the arrival of a new generation in Bollywood, he quipped, 'tiger is 23 years old And I'm just a year older than him
 main 24 saal kaa hum'
 Brother someone has told the truth, age is not judged from the birth certificate, but from the heart of the person

 pandas ne grih mantralay main saat sutreey aavedan dekar baapu kii hatya kii praathmiki, aarope patr sahit anya jaankaree maangi he, jisamen yah bhi shaamil he ki kya kanoon ke anusaarbapuki parthiv deh kaa postmortem kiya gaya tha
 The Ministry sent this application to the Director of Archives of India, Darshan Samiti and Gandhi Smriti
 gandhi smriti ko pehle birla house kaha jaataa tha, jahaan baapu ne aakhri din bitaye the or jahaan unki hatya kii gai thi
 What had not happened was Bapu's postmortem National Archives has informed Panda that he can come to his office to get the necessary information kept under the provisions of Public Records Act 1993 and Public Records Rules 1997
 gandhi smriti or darshan samiti ne unhen suchit kiya he ki baapu ke parivaar waalon kii ichha ke mutabik postmortem nahin kiya gaya tha
 Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti also told Panda that they had no information about the FIR and charge sheet filed by Delhi Police in connection with the murder of Mahatma Gandhi on 30 January 1948
 jawaab main gandhi smriti ne kaha he ki tughlaq road police thane ne hatya ke baad praathmiki darj kii or jaanch kii thi
 Information Commissioner Sharad Sabharwal stated that according to the appellant, he sought information from the Ministry of Home Affairs and he should provide that information
 unke anusaar, iske baad hamane grih mantralay ke sipiio ko ek baar phir yah jaanch karne ke liye kaha ki kya pointer number-1 (praathmiki evam aaropapatr) ke sandarbh main koi soochna uske paas yaa tughlaq road police thane ke paas he
 Sabharwal said that if no information is available in the Ministry of Home Affairs or Tughlaq Road Police Station, the CPIO of the Ministry will give a reply in writing to Panda
 unhone bataaya ki ayog ke uparokt adeshon kaa paalan grih mantralay ke sipiio ko aadesh milane ke 30 din ke bheetar karnaa he

 in teenon main ek baat samaanya he vah yah ki in teenon jagahon par aatanki hamalaa hua
 It is not enough that terrorists came to these three places through water
 jhelum ke dariyaa ko hamalon ke khatir rasta banaaya
 It is a matter of concern for the security forces that the terrorists are now resorting to the river for infiltration
 yani hamale kii jagah pahunchane ke saath-saath ghuspaith ke liye bhi pani kaa sahaara or isse nipatna aasaan nahin he
 It is clear that when vigilance increases on the ground, then terrorists are resorting to water as an alternative
 khufia sutron ke mutabik sarhad paar ke aatanki training campon main aatankiyon ko tairne ke liye bhi special training di ja rahi he jisase aatanki ghanton tak gahare pani ke bheetar rah sakate hai
 The comments aapako ye bataa den ki baraamula, uri or pampor main jin jin jagahon par aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya he wo sabhi nadiyon ke aasapaas hi hai
 It is also learned that after the surgical strike, Pakistan has not only shifted its terrorist camps running near the border and has also changed its strategy for attack in Kashmir valley
 pehle fidaayin hamalavar ghuspaith ke tunrat baad hamale ko anjaam dete the, lekin ab ghuspaith ke baad sleeper cell kii madad se pehle panaah lete hai
 After this, they attack after checking the security of military camps or military convoys
 surakshabalon ke liye ye chintaa kaa vishay he ki aatanki ab ghuspaith ke liye nadi kaa sahaara lene lage hai
 That is, it is not easy to reach the place of attack as well as to resort to water for infiltration and to deal with it
 saaf he jab jamini raste par chaukasee badi to aatanki vikalp ke taur par pani kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 According to intelligence sources, in the terrorist training camps across the border, special training is also being given to the terrorists to swim, so that the terrorists can remain under deep water for hours
 tippaniyan Let us tell you that the places where terrorists have attacked in Baramulla, Uri and Pampore are all around the rivers

 Earlier the fidayeen attackers carried out the attack immediately after the infiltration, but now after the infiltration, the sleeper takes shelter with the help of the cell
 iske baad sainya campon yaa phir sainya kafila kii suraksha vyavastha kii jaanch padtaal ke baad hamale karte hai
 It is clear that when vigilance increases on the ground, then terrorists are resorting to water as an alternative

 saal 2016 bhartiya share bazaar ke liye chunautiyon bharaa rahaa
 The market was scarred by global pressure in the early months of the year
 march main kendra sarkaar ke bajet se bazaar ko majbootee kaa rukh karne kaa mauka mila
 Then the monsoon, the implementation of GST and the cut in interest rates, brought the good news to the market
 lekin saal ke aakhri maheenon main america ke raashtrapati chunaav or desh main notebandi ke faisle ne ek baar phir bazaar ko jhatka diya
 Now for the Indian stock market, 2017 is going to remain the same as 2016 because these 5 events of 2016 will maintain their impact on the market
 1
 Demonetisation will keep pressure on the corporate sector's third quarter results
 haalanki desh mencashles iconomiki disha main badhate prayaason se companiyon ko iskaa phayda 2017 main nae vitt varsh se milanaa shuru ho jayega
 Meanwhile, the benefits of demonetisation can be assessed by the Reserve Bank
 2
 The government will see the benefit of the demonetization move to curb black money by April 2017, when it will be decided how many blackmoney of demonetisation was left in the bank
 is phaayde kaa istemaal kendra sarkaar april ke baad desh main infrastracchar main nivesh kar saktaa he jisase share bazaar ko majbootee ke sanket milegein
 3
 duniyabar kii arthvyavasthaaon main 2016 byaaj daron main kataiti ke liye rahaa
 The Indian stock market was in constant danger of rising interest rates in the US during 2016
 lekin saal ke ant main rigerv bank ne byaaj daron ko kam kiya or ek hafte main america main byaaj daron ko badha diya gaya
 This exercise by the US has been done to pull foreign investment from emerging markets
 4
 The Indian stock market touched its lowest level of the year on 29 February 2016 when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented his annual budget
 yah bajet aage ke maheenon main bazaar ke utaar-chadhaav kaa kaaran bana
 Now in February 2017, once again the finance minister has the challenge to strengthen the market through the budget
 aagaamee bajet main koshish 2016 ke bajet kii kamajoriyon ko dur karne kii hogi
 5
 kendra sarkaar ne 2016 main jiesti lagu karne par aam raay bana lee he
 Now in mid-2017 (till September) there will be an attempt to introduce GST in the country
 ise lagu karte hi share bazaar par shuruaati dabaav pad sakate hai lekin iske sahare 2017 ke ant tak bazaar nai unchaaiyon ko chhu saktaa he
 However, experts believe that the implementation of GST will give a boost to the market in case the impact of demonetisation ends soon

 Even in July this year due to rain, the fish did not get much in the river even when the water increased
 udhar, nadiyon ke visheshgy kalyaan bhi kolkata ke duusare nivaasiyon kii tarah apni pasandida machhlee ke lupt hone ke kaaran chintit hai
 They say that the disappearance of this fish can be an early warning of a bad omen or a great disaster

 Due to this, silt is increasing in the river

 "there is no Hilsa in the Ganges this year," says Sujoy Haldar, 36, another fisherman in Malpara after moving upstream along the Ganges
 ” ve ab nirmaan sthalon par mazdooree bhi karne lage hai

 The Indian Railways crosses 21 million signals every day to reach more than 3 crore passengers
 par doosraa pahalu dekhie, har saal rail haadason main kareeb 26,000 log marate hai
 In more than half of the cases, railway personnel are responsible for these accidents
 aise main railway ise lekar kitna gambhir he?har haadase ke baad rail prashasan iske liye jimmedaar driver yaa duusare karmchaariyon ko kadi sajaa dene or ghatana kii jaanch karaane kaa vaada karata he
 But the recent revelations from a Right to Information (RTI) appeal have put a question mark on the seriousness of the railways in this matter
 jaanch main doshi paae jane ke baavjood badi sankhya main driver apane pad par yaa usase neeche ke pad par waapas aakar naukari kar rahe hai
 However, the railways has agreed that 62 per cent of railway accidents are caused by the failure of its employees
 artiai apil ke jawaab main ab tak (17 main se) chaar kshetreey karyaalayon or (67 main se) aath mandal karyaalayon se jawaab mili hai
 According to them, between January 2005 and November 2011, 132 drivers who were convicted in accidents were fired and 35 were forcibly retired
 duusari ore in driveron ne railway main dayaa yachika daayar kii
 As a result, 23 drivers were restored to their original positions
 unase kam bhaagyashaalee 39 driver thodaa nichle ohade par lautne main kaamyaab rahe
 That is, far from going behind bars, 62 out of 167 convicted drivers managed to get their jobs
 jo driver nichle ohade par waapas aae hai unamem se kuch teen saal baad puraane ohade par aane ke paatr ban jaaenge
 Make it clear here that north-central Railway (allahabad) and east-central Railway (hajipur), which had removed the highest number of 36 and 29 drivers respectively, refused to provide any records about the drivers restored after the appeal
 done
 jaahir he, yah sankhya bad sakati he
 Ashok Kumar of Agra, in his RTI petition, had asked the Railway Board that "how many drivers who were found guilty solely for railway accidents were taken on the basis of mercy appeal?" One reason behind Kumar's appeal was
 pichley saal may main dilli se sate faridabad ke paas ve khud ek rail haadase ke gavaah bane the
 After the accident, i asked the driver what action would be taken against you? He kept telling me that the investigation would go on and later i would come back to work again
 '' kumaar sachmuch sakapaka gaye
 They began to doubt whether there was any strictness against the guilty drivers
 har jaruri chote-bade faisle lene vaale railway board kaa ravaiya dekhie
 The details of the drivers to be punished remain with him but he did not directly respond to RTI
 isaki bajaae vah arji usne vibhinn kshetreey or mandaleey karyaalayon kii ore badha di, bhulbhulaiya main bhatakane ke liye
 Kumar has received answers from places so far
 india today ne vahi aankade railway board se sidhe hasil kiye
 According to them, between January 2005 and December 2011, the railways fired 226 drivers or found them forced to retire after being found guilty of accidents
 railway main kisi karmchaaree ko naukari se hataane ke yahi tareeke hai
 According to the board, 19 of the 226 drivers were restored to the original post and 78 to the lower post following mercy appeals
 jitani jagahon se abhi tak jawaab mili hai, unheen ke mutabik ukt avadhi main 23 driver mul pad par behaal hue, jabaki board ke mutabik puure desh bhar main 19 driveron kii hi mul par bahaali hui
 After all, how do the guilty drivers get reinstated? Is there some khichdi in the railway behind mercy petitions? Vinay Mittal, Chairman of the Railway Board, did not consider it appropriate to talk despite the efforts of India Today
 board ke pravaktaa anil kumaar saxena ne apni taraf se bharsak paksh rakhane kii koshish kii
 That the railway is very strict about the safety of passengers
 haadason ke liye jimmedaar driveron kii pahchaan or unhen dandit karne ke liye railway main saaf-saaf niyam kaayade hai
 "as far as the mercy petition is concerned, the principle of natural justice that applies to every citizen of the country is the same for the railway employees
 aise karmchaaree faisle ke khilaaf nirnay ke liye ucch adhikari ke paas apil karte hai
 In many cases the Appellate Authority makes a concession to the employee after considering the appeal, but this is done only after a detailed investigation
 vaise bhi kisi haadase main mauton ke maamalon kii jaanch railway suraksha ayukta karata he, jo railway kaa nahin balki kisi duusare vibhaag kaa adhikari hota he
 In such a situation, where does the question of taking the driver back to service arise from doubt? ''amuman use barabari ke ohade kaa hi koi doosraa daayitv saunpa jaataa he
 "how to believe these claims?" These claims are just as true, why Amitabh, the then Director (safety) of the Ministry of Railways, at the 2005 International Rail Safety Conference in Cape Town (south Africa), said that more than 60% of railway accidents between 1994 and 2004 were caused by failure of railway employees Let's look at those who were restored
 uttar railway ke nai dilli mandal main 2005 se november, 2011 ke bich 12 driveron ko hataaya gaya
 When he appealed against his conviction, nine of them managed to get reinstated
 dhyaan rahe, sadak haadason main doshi tehraae jane vaale trek driver lambii adalati prakriya ke baad jail main chakki piste hai
 On the other hand, the railway drivers get restored in the middle and enjoy the job again
 uttar railway ke hi ambala chhavnee mandal kii sthiti bhi bahut alag nahin he
 In the same period, eight drivers were fired and one was forced to retire
 sajaa paae driveron ko apil kerani hi thi
 Four of them were sent to the lower post of Shunter for three years
 teen saal ke baad ye chaaron phir se mul pad par aane kii paatrata hasil kar lenge
 In the case of two other drivers, the sentence for removal from service was changed to forced retirement
 yani laabh to aakhir use bhi mila
 Look at the condition of East Coast Railway (bhubaneswar)
 yahaan takreeban sabhi dayaa yachikaaon par driveron ke paksh main faisla hua
 16 drivers were removed and five were forcibly retired
 in 21 driveron main se 14 ne apni sajaa ke khilaaf ucch adhikariyon ke saamne apil kii
 13 of them managed to get mercy
 paanch driver to sidhe mul pad par waapas aa gaye, jabaki aath ko nichle padon par posting di gai
 Similarly, in Bilaspur division of South East Central Railway, 23 drivers were removed from the job and three were forced to retire
 dayaa yachika ke baad in 26 main se 23 naukari bachaane main kaamyaab rahe or 10 to apane mul pad par waapas laut aae
 In the south-eastern railway (kolkata) of West Bengal's Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi, 12 drivers were removed from service and one was forcibly retired
 in 13 main se apil sirf teen ne kii or teenon ko mul pad waapas mil gaya
 In Jabalpur division of West Central Railway, four drivers were removed from service and two were forcibly retired
 in chah main se paanch kii naukari dayaa apil ke baad batch gai
 Answers from Kota, Hajipur, Allahabad, Nagpur, Ferozepur, Agra and Nagpur are also seen telling a similar story
 yahaan sawaal yah uthta he ki kya baaki sarkari vibhaagon kii tarah railway main bhi kisi haadase kii jimmedaari tay karne main bahut lanbaa samay lagata he
 Initially convicted drivers often escape easily after a revision appeal
 railway ke is bare main apane tark ho sakate hai, lekin neshnal krime record beuro ke mutabik 2005 ke baad se rail haadason main har saal ausatan 26,000 yatri jaan ganvaate hai
 In 2010, this death toll had reached 27,000
 maut ke aankadon kaa yah pahaad railway ko chetane ke liye kaaphi nahin ki vah apni dayaa khaas maukon ke liye bachaakar rakhe or doshi driveron ke saath sakhti se pesh aae? a video has gone viral on social media in which three lions are on the road
 ve shaan se tahaltey hue aage bad rahe hai or unke peeche kaaren unke peeche-peeche dhire-dhire bad raheen hai
 This video which was frightening and surprising was first shared on Facebook on a page named 'lions of Kruger Park and Sabi Sand'
 baad main yah video viral hota gaya
 This video was viewed by 2 million people and thousands of comments were made on it
 yah video dakshin africa ke kruger nesanak park (kruger National Park) kaa he
 This half-minute video shows how four lions, known as the king of the jungle, can occupy a busy road
 sheron ke peeche badhati kaaron kii gati bahut dhimi he

 It is now clear that the electoral riot of Delhi will be between two former allies of the Anna movement
 ek taraf 49 dinon ke purv mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal hai to duusari ore5 din pehle bijepi main ain kiran bedi
 Kiran was formally declared the chief ministerial candidate by the party on Monday night
 bijepi ko arvind kejariwal ke mukaable ke liye kiran bedi ke rup main ek majboot cheharaa to mil gaya he, lekin unki 'parachute entry' se kuch or sawaal bhi khadey ho rahe hai
 In recent times, wherever the BJP won the election, it made Modi's favorite and Sangh-approved leaders sit on the chair
 maharashtra, jharkhand or haryana main bijepi ke mukaable main koi eemaandaar chhavi kii bharosemand party nahin thi
 Also, the anti-incumbency trend also went in favor of BJP
 lekin dilli main apni 49 dinon kii sarkaar main bijli-pani sasta karne vaali aam aadmi party uske liye majboot pratidwandvi thi
 Therefore, the BJP had to abandon the policy of giving chair to union-approved leaders with political experience here
 chunaav se 25 din pehle usne shunya raajnneetik anubhav vaali desh kii pehali mahila ipies adhikari ko party main shaamil kiya or iske paanch din baad unhen mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 This means that the BJP had no face compared to Kejriwal, which could compete with his popularity and image
 kiran bedi ke naam khulaa khatsoshal media par yah sawaal bhi charchaa main he ki agar kejariwal or unki party mukaable main na hoti to kya bijepi apane varishton ko darkinar kar kiran bedi ko shaamil karti? bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or unki team is baat ko samajhate hai ki dilli main kejariwal or unki party hi unke liye ekmaatr chunauti hai
 In recent days, several election surveys are describing Arvind Kejriwal as the favorite Chief Minister of Delhi
 dilli ke 20 fisadi dalit votaron main unki acchhee pakad he
 In rural outer Delhi too, she seems to be in a stronger position than in the previous elections
 lihaaja bijepi ne ek aise chehre ko bhi laane se gurej nahin kiya jo purv main bijepi kii aalochak rahi hai
 It should also be remembered that Kiran Bedi has also sought clarification from Narendra Modi on Twitter regarding BJP funding and Gujarat riots
 lekin chunaav jeetne ke liye bijepi or kiran bedi donon ne na sirf puraane gile bhula die hai, balki sambhavat: dilli ke apane varisht netaaon kii naaraazgi bhi mol le lee he
 Kiran Bedi's entry has opened a window for the BJP
 agar bijepi bahumat se dur rahi to vah is khidki ke sahare pradhanmantri narendra modi ko haar kii jimmedaari se bachaa sakati he
 That is, if BJP wins, then its Sehra Modi wave and Amit Shah head of leadership, and if it loses it then Kiran Bedi
 ab ladaai spasht rup se kiran bedi banaam arvind kejariwal kii ho gai he
 But the question is, will the slogan of 'chalo Chalein Modi ke saath' be modified now? pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif karne ke liye party kii ore se karrwai kaa saamana karne ke kuch hi din baad congress ke saansad shashi tharur ne vizinjam main ek safai abhiyaan kaa netritv kiya
 Along with this, he said that no political meaning should be derived from it
 modi kii tarif or ‘svachh bharat’ ke abhiyaan kaa samarthan karne par kerala pradesh congress samiti kii ore se shikaayat kiye jane ke baad tharur ko akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke pravaktaa pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 Tharoor removed the garbage from a place near Vizhinjam port in his parliamentary constituency
 swatchta abhiyaan main apni sakriy bhagidaari kaa bachaav karte hue tharur ne kaha, ‘yah kisi raajnneetik dal kaa visheshadhikaar nahin he or apane aasapaas ko svachh rakhane kaa sandesh sabase pehle mahatma gandhi ne diya tha
 When Tharoor was asked whether these actions of his would be considered a violation of the warning issued by the party, he said, "gandhi said that cleanliness is more important than freedom
" lekin gandhi ke liye sharir or mastishk kii safai bhi utani hi mahatvapurn thi, jiskaa arth he ki dil ko ghrinaa or hinsa se mukt karnaa bhi mahatvapurn he
 Tharoor, a second time Congress MP from the capital of Kerala, said that the AICC has also appealed to the Congress workers to join a month-long cleanliness campaign started on Gandhi Jayanti
 input- bhashaa Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi reached Lucknow for the first time after being given the charge of Eastern Uttar Pradesh
 is maukey par rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi ne airport se lekar congress daphtar tak baarah kilometre lanbaa ek road sho bhi kiya
 a crowd of enthusiastic Congress workers also gathered in the roadshow, but in the end, when Priyanka Gandhi left without saying anything, these activists got some disappointment
 lakhanu subah se priyanka kii raah dekh rahaa tha
 Everyone was eyeing this first political journey of the new Congress General Secretary
 priyanka gandhi ke saath rahul gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi maujuud the
 The stage was being decorated at the Congress headquarters in Lucknow
 priyanka dopaher baad lakhanu pahunchin
 His convoy left the open road and walked through some of the city's narrow and congested roads
 bich main jhulate taron kii vajah se road sho kii bas chhod esayuvi kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 a small street corner was held at Lal Bagh near Hazratganj
 yahaan bhi rahul apane jane-pahachaane agenda ke saath dikhe
 The convoy reached the Congress headquarters around six o'clock
 saje hue manch par priyanka, rahul, jyotiraditya sindhiya or rajbabbar aae
 Then everyone's eyes were fixed on Priyanka
 lekin pehle raaj babbar or phir rahul ne bolnaa shuru kiya
 But Priyanka kept quiet
 wo manch se utar ain
 Suddenly for a moment, there was a silence in the crowd
 is puure road sho kii chamak jaise priyanka ke na bolne se kuch feeki pad gai
 India has termed PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's remark 'far from reality' that his party will take the entire Kashmir back from it
 bharat ne yah bhi kaha he ki desh kii akhandta or ekta 'molbhav karne laayak nahin' he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said, "we are in the process of looking forward and being anxious about things ahead does not mean that our borders will change
" hamanen yah bahut spasht kar diya he ki jahaan tak hamaari baat he, bharat kii akhandta or ekta molbhav karne yogya nahin he
 He said that this comment is far from the reality that will take us back to the last century
 vahiin bhaajapa ne bilaval bhutto ke is bayaan ko 'bachakaana or aparipakv' bataaya he
 Describing Kashmir as an integral part of India, senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that it has become his habit to make such provocative statements by the leaders of Pakistan, but the security forces of India like the former to protect their land and give a befitting reply to Pakistan Are able to iske alaava congress ne bhi bilaval ke is tippanee kii bhartsana kii he
 Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed said, 'she is young, her 70 books have been dreaming of occupying Kashmir
 unhen abhi 70 pidiyon tak or intjaar karnaa hoga
 They have no idea of india's potential
 ' Addressing party workers in Multan region of Punjab yesterday, Pakistan's next generation leader Bilawal said that his Pakistan People's Party would withdraw the entire Kashmir from India
 unhone kaha, 'main kashmir ko waapas luungaa, samooche ko, or main ek inch bhi jameen nahin chhoduunga kyonki anya praanton kii tarah yah pakistan kaa he
 When Bilawal made this remark, former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and King Pervez Ashraf were next to him
 bilaval ne 2018 main hone vaala aamchunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 He will lead the secular PPP which officially seeks good relations with India

 upi samet paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav khatm hone ke saath hi team anna ne chunaav kharch ko lekar congress ko gherne kii koshish kii he
 Arvind Kejriwal, a member of Team Anna, has demanded Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh to make Rahul Gandhi's helicopter tours and the rest of the expenditure public
 kejariwal ne tivetor par likhaa he ki jab digvijay singh ne anna ke andolan kaa hisaab maanga tha to team anna ne 24 ghante main kharch kaa sara byora de diya tha
 Now it's Digvijay Singh's turn
 kejariwal ne baaki dalon se bhi aisa karne ko kaha he
 Kejriwal wrote on Twitter that when Digvijay Singh asked for the account of Anna's movement, Team Anna gave all the details of the expenditure in 24 hours
 ab digvijay singh kii baari he
 Kejriwal has asked other parties to do the same
 bhaajapa sansadeey board ne rajasthan party vidhayak dal ke netaa pad se vasundhara raaje ke istife ko sweekaar kar liya
 This information was given by party general secretary Anant Kumar after the board meeting chaired by party president Rajnath Singh and in the presence of senior leader LK Advani
 rajasthan main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main party ke kharaab pradarshan kii javabdehi tay karte hue party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne teen maheene pehle hi unhen pradesh vidhansabha kii netaa pad se turant istipha dene ko kaha tha
 After months of deferring, Vasundhara went to the residence of senior party leader LK Advani a few hours before the board meeting and submitted his resignation
 sutron ne bataaya ki istipha saunpte samay vasundhara kaaphi bhavuk thim or unki ankhon main aansu the
 According to sources, Vasandhura alleged in his letter that the way he was asked to resign was very humiliating
 unhone kendriya netritv par party ke bheetar loktantr ko samaapt karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Sources also said that Vasundhara also questioned why accountability was not decided in the party of general elections since the first Lok Sabha elections of 1952, so why she was chosen for it
 shaam ko board dwaara istipha sweekaar kar liye jane ke turant baad vasundhara party ke sheersh netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi se milane unke nivas gai
 He is said to have alleged in his resignation that many central ministers of the party acted against him while being the Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 unhone yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki ek mahila hone ke naate bhi unase party main bhed-bhav kiya gaya he
 Rajnath Singh had made Vasundhara's resignation a question on her nose and she used all kinds of pressure to get her order obeyed but she kept avoiding it
 aadesh nahin maanane par unhone istife ke bare main unase baatcheet ke liye sitambar main varisht netaa em venkaiya naidu ko or baad main sushamaa swaraj ko niyukt kiya
 But Vasundhara did not meet either of the two
 vasundhara ke is aacharan par party netritv ne kadaa rukh akhriyaar kiya he or party sutron kaa kahana he ki iske kaaran unhen nikat bhavishya main party main kendriya str par bhi koi bhoomika milanaa bhi mushkil he
 Ananth Kumar said that apart from accepting Vasundhara's resignation, the parliamentary board meeting reviewed the party's performance in the recently concluded Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh assembly elections
 iske liye in rajyon ke prabharee or vahaan ke pradesh adhyakshon ko baithak main bulaayaa gaya tha
 Apart from this, appointments of party observers were also made for the meetings to be held to elect the leader of the legislative party in these three states
 maharashtra ke liye arun jetali or anant kumaar, haryana ke liye thavar chand gahalot or vijay goyal tathaa arunachal pradesh ke liye vijaya chakravarti ko party kii ore se kendriya paryvekshak banaaya gaya he
 The Municipal Corporation is now preparing to collect property tax from the slums to overcome its economic troubles
 okhla main golakuna slam ilaake main praparty ke naam par paanch foot kii ek choti si dukaan chalaane vaale jagadish ke paas praparty tex kaa notice aa chukaa he
 When we reached the slum of Amar Singh while going through the narrow streets of this slum, a similar property tax notice was given there
 darasal, nagar nigam commercial bijli ke conection ko aadhaar banaakar praparty tex bhej rahaa he
 In these slums, which have a mill, press or small electric shop, all the people have come under the purview of property tax
 yahi nahin, dilli ke kareeb 10 hazaar vakeelon ke chambaron ko bhi praparty tex kii notice bheji gai he
 However, Subhash Arya, Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, says that when we are running tight, we have to find a source of income from somewhere
 isi ke chalate hamane kammertial bijli ke bill ko aadhaar banaakar praparty tex kii adwijuri jari kii he
 Why was it slow to recover money from big defaulters: Comments lekin sawaal ye uth rahe hai ki uttari, dakshini or purvi dilli nagar nigam apni kangaali dur karne ke liye praparty tex vasuulne kaa dayera to badha rahe hai
 However, Rs 102 crore is outstanding from the Sports Authority of India
 firoz shah kotla maidan jahaan ipel ke chalate karodon kii kamai hoti he, is ground par 2 karod kaa praparty tex bakaayaa he
 Similarly, apart from governmental departments like Delhi Police, DDA, Education Department, property tax of some big rich people of Delhi is outstanding
 lekin, inhen vasuulne main nigam susti dikhaa rahi he
 According to one figure, corporations owe more than 1200 crore property tax

 But the question is arising that the Municipal Corporation of North, South and East Delhi is increasing the scope of collecting property tax to remove its bankrupt
 lekin, sports othority of india se 102 karod rupye bakaayaa he
 Feroz Shah Kotla Maidan, where the IPL earns crores, owes a property tax of 2 crores on this ground
 isi tarah dilli police, didie, shiksha vibhaag jaise sarkari mahakamon ke alaava dilli ke kuch bade rais logon ke buildingon ke praparty tex bakaayaa he

 film ek sex kamedi he or kya darshakon ko theatre tak khinch paane main sakasham he? aaiye pataa karte hai-kahaneeyah kahani do doston sani kele (tushaar kapur) or aditya chotia (vir das) kii he jo aid agency main kaam karte hai
 But both of them are thrown out of the company for some reason, then Sunny and Aditya open their own ad agency
 kahani aage badhati he or phir donon ko ek hi jaisi dikhne vaali lekin do alag-alag personality kii ladakiyon lily lele (sani leone) or laila lele(sani leone)se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Then there is a lot of confusion and finally the film gets executed

 The script of the script has been written by Milap Jhaveri himself
 milaap ne youth ke hisaab se tarah-tarah ke panch is kahani main daalane kii koshish kii he
 There are many double meaning jokes in the film that you get to hear and see, as well as the presence of Sunny Leone adds to the intensity of the performance of the organ

 Due to these songs, the pace of the film seems slow

 Despite this, DU did nothing
 bisiai kaa yah bhi kahana he ki uniwarsity 2008 ke legal ajukeshan niyam kaa paalan bhi nahin kar rahi he
 As per the law, the law college, law institute and law school which had not undergone inspection for five years were to be recognized by BCI by 31 July 2010
 jin collejon ne is niyam kaa paalan nahin kiya unhen kanoonee degree dene kaa koi haq nahin he
 BCI Secretary Puneet Mittal said that after 2011-12, the degree of students of these centers of the university is not valid
 is kaaran se in centaron ke students practice nahin kar sakate
 At the same time, Ashwini Kumar, Dean of Law Faculty has said that there is no need for students to get upset
 unhone kaha, 'hamane bisiai ko yaad dilaayaa he ki unhone manyata dene ke liye is varsh 31 disambar tak kaa samay diya tha
 This is not a big issue

 In Kerala, there has been a loss of property worth billions and more than 350 lives have also been lost in this disaster
 har koikeralako is sankat se ubaarane ke liye harsambhav madad kar rahaa he
 In this sequence, the UAE has also offered assistance of 700 crores to India
 vaise aadhikarik sutron ke mutabik bharat sarkaar ne yuai kii is peshkash ko lene se manaa kar diya he
 In fact, since the announcement of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a few years ago about disaster assistance, India has not taken financial help of any other country in any kind of natural disasters
 isi ke tahat sutron ke hawaale se indian express ne ek report main kaha he, 'sarkaar 2004 se is niti ke aadhaar par chal rahi he
 Since then no assistance has been taken from any foreign government
 ' ab kerala kii baadh traasadee main videshi madad kii peshkash ko lekar sutara ne report main sambandhit niti par adig rahane kii baat kahi he
 Explain that in December 2004, when India was facing tsunami, a historic change was made in India's disaster assistance policy
 haalanki usase pehle bharat ne videshi sarkaron se madad lee thi
 The government also sought help during Uttarkashi (1991), Latur earthquake (1993), Gujarat earthquake (2001), Bengal cyclone (2002) and Bihar floods (july 2004)
 kya thi manmohan singh kii niti?disambar 2004 main pradhanmantri singh ne kaha tha, 'hamen lagata he ki ham khud sthiti kaa saamana kar sakate hai or agar hamen madad kii jarurat mahasoos hogi to ham le lenge
 'since then, other states of the country are also adopting this policy and are not taking any help from other foreign governments
 bataa den ki 2004 kitsunamimen tamilnadu ke saath andaman nicobar aadi rajyon main kaaphi jan-dhan kii haani hui thi
 It killed 12 thousand people and 6 lakh were transferred
 aisi niti kii vajah se sarkaron ne mahasoos kiya ki bharat main aapadaaon ko sanbhaalane kii kshamta he
 At the same time, the reason for this policy is that taking help from any one such government opens doors for other countries as well and it can be very difficult to refuse any other country
 haalanki yah niti videshi sarkaron tak hi simit he, kyonki isamen koi sanghathan or nijee vyakti shaamil nahin he
 So an NGO or a private person can help in this
 bharat ne pehle bhi kiya he manapichley 14 saalon main bharat ne uttarakhandbadh, kashmir main bukamp, kashmir baadh ke dauraan rus, america, japan se madad lene se manaa kar diya tha

 saudi arab ne 2001 ke bhuj bukamp ke baad is tarah kii saamagree ko teen vimaanon se bheja tha, lekin nakadi bhejne kaa prastaav shaayad hi kisi desh ne pehle diya ho

 However, he did say that the UAE offer was very good and moderate

 singhdev kehete hai,'' agar chhattisgarh sarkaar apnijanata ke prati samvedansheel hoti to baat tribunel banane tak aati hi nahin
 Raman Singh could not keep the issue of public interest firmly
 nadi ke puure pani par yahaan kii janata kaa adhikaar he
 Its first use will be for drinking, second use for farmers and remaining water will be used in industry
 ''mahanadi jalabantwaaraa vivaad aisa mudda he jo aam janata or kisaanon ko sidhaa prabhavit karata he
 In such a situation, this issue will play a central role during the election campaign
 pichley haftekendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan ne saarvajanik taur par chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ke mahanadi vivaad par die bayaan ko aade haathon liya tha
 Raman Singh said, we are currently using Mahanadi water
 bhavishya main or bhi istemaal karenge
 Pradhan reacted sharply to this
 unhone kaha, raman singh kaa yah bayaan nindaneey he
 The stand of the Odisha BJP unit is clear that the interests of the people here will not be compromised
 udhar odisha main bhi agle saal chunaav hone hai, aise main bijd is mudde par talkh he
 If the BJP unit of Odisha remains silent on this, next year the BJD will use this issue vigorously in campaigning against the BJP
 ab odisha ke bhaajapa netaa hone ke naate mahendra pradhan is masale par chup nahin hoskate
 Therefore, in two states, 'bjp-making BJP' will be faster with Mahanadi water
 udhar mahanadi ke pani ke liye party ke bheetar hi thani jang ne vipaksh ko ek acha chunavimudda thama diya he
 What is the fight? In the year 2000, Chhattisgarh started building six barrages on Nemhanadi after separating from Madhya Pradesh
 chhattisgarh banane se pehle madhya pradesh aurodisha is vivaad ko joint control board ke jariye sulajhane ke liye taiyaar the
 But when the new state was formed, Raman Singh government gave a shock to the Odisha government by taking a decision to build a barrage on Mahanadi
 is par 2016 main odisha sarkaar ne supreme court seartical 131 ke tahat inter state dispute tribunel banane kii maang kar di
 In March 2018, following a Supreme Court order, the Center established a three-member 'mahanadi Water Dispute Tribunal'
 tribunel ne 6 agast ko paanchon rajyon ko notice bheja ki ve apane yahaan se is mudde par baat karne ke liye pratinidhiyon ko naamankit karen
 In April, the Ministry of Water Resources called representatives from all the five states to discuss the issue, while in Odisha, the BJD expressed displeasure, saying that by doing so, the Center wants to disrupt the work of the Mahanadi Water Dispute Tribunal
 chunavi mausam main mahanadi banegaa mahamuddabijad pichley 18 saalon seodisa me he
 The antincombency factor thus dominates
 orissa sarkaar is mudde ko ourbhadakaayegi
 On the other hand, Raman Singh government is also two to four factors of anti-incumbency
 aise main vah bhi is mudde par bhadkegi
 But the opposition will try to take advantage of this issue the most
 chhattisgarh ke chunaav kuch maheene baad hi hone hai
 Leader of Opposition T

 It is clear from Singhdev that this time during the Chhattisgarh elections, political fire will be set on the waters of Mahanadi
 agle saal hone vaale odisha chunaavon main to yah or bhi garam hoga
 Starting from Dhamtari district of Mahanadichhattisgarh, this river reaches Odisha
 yah nadi aanshik rup se kuch maharashtra, jharkhand or madhyapradesh se bhi faili he
 
 *** With this defeat Sri Lanka's embarrassing tour of England came to an end in which they could not win any of the nine international matches
 chotil bhartiya tej gendbaaj eshanth sharma kaa england ke khilaaf somvaar ko hone vaale duusare ek divasiy antarrashtriya mukaable main baahar rahanaa tay he jabaki yuvaraj singh ke khilne par faisla match se pehle liya jayega
 Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told reporters on Sunday that Ishant is certain to stay out of this match because if he does not play here, he will have to recover from an ankle injury in the fourth and final Test against Australia in Nagpur
 You will get five to seven days
 yuvaraj ne shuukravaar ko rajkot main hue pehle vanade main 138 ran kii naabad pari khelkar england ke akraman ko tahas nahas kar diya tha lekin unhen qamar main dard kii samasya thi
 Regarding the playing of Yuvraj, Dhoni said that the final decision on this will be taken before the match
 unhone kaha ki yuvaraj kii haalat main kaaphi sudhaar hua he lekin unke khilne ke bare main ham match se pehle hi antim nirnay le paaenge

 nepali sansad ne buudhvaar ko masik dharm ke dauraan mahilaon ke ghar main pravesh ko varjit karne vaali puraani pratha ko aparaadh ghoshit kar diya
 In various communities in Nepal, women are considered impure during menstruation and in some remote areas they are forced to live in a hut away from home during this period
 is pratha ko chhaupadi ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The new law provides for a three-month jail sentence or a fine of Rs 2000 or both for forcing a woman to follow the practice
 mahilaon ko masik dharm kii avadhi ke dauraan ghar se dur ek jhopadi main sone ke liye vivash kiya jaataa he jise chau goth kaha jaataa he
 Last month, a teenager sleeping in a similar hut was bitten by a snake and died
 2016 main bhi is kupratha ke kaaran do mahilaon kii jaan chali gai thi
 The top court of the country had banned this practice more than a decade ago, but it is still practiced in many parts of the country
 dhvanimat se paarit is kanoon main kaha gaya he ki maahvaaree ke dauraan mahila ko chhaupadi ke tahat baahar nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Such harassment or untouchability would be considered inhuman behavior
 nepal main chhaupadi kii parampara hindutv se judi hui he or is parampara main maahvaaree ke dauraan or bachche paidaa hone ke baad bhi mahilaon ko achhut mana jaataa he
 During this time women are expelled from the house and kept away from touching food, touching religious symbols and even from animals and men

 In those years when she used to be the "representative" Chief Minister of Bihar, for which she was grateful for her marriage certificate, Rabri Devi was recognized for talking less and doing even less work, both of which were completely done She was in the hands of her husband - that is, Lalu Prasad's real reins of power from Patna
 lekin satta ke haath se jane ke baad ve na keval jam kar bolti hai balki netritv bhi sanbhaalane lagi hai
 Both of them are quite uncouth
 unhone del caranegi ke bare main nahin suna hoga or na hi ve bhaashan dene kii jaani-pahachaani takneekon se parichit hongi
 Not only this, they do exactly the opposite of the Blue Book of Speech — like not pre-empting the speech and ignoring the use of spoken words, and even more politically correct grammar
 ve kahati hai, ''main vahi bolti hum, jo meraa dil kahata he
 In the midst of these Lok Sabha elections filled with enthusiasts, Rabri Devi's bitter remarks on her rivals have provoked the anger of NDA leaders
 nitish kumaar sarkaar par aalochanatmak hamale or jansabhaon main jamaa hue logon ke saath najar se najar milakar bhaashan dene se bihar kii vipaksh kii netaa bihar or jharkhand main sarvaadhik suni jane vaali hasti main tabdeel ho gai hai
 Sharp arrows of words on his opponents have brought him into the limelight
 or iskaa asar bhi dekha ja rahaa he-bihar janata dal united ke adhyaksh rajeev ranjan singh urf lallan singh unke khilaaf aapraadhik manahani kaa mukadmaa darj kara chuke hai
 Nitish found that this thing could be given more air and he said that if Rabri can abuse the Chief Minister, imagine what she will do to the general public after the RJD comes to power
 to kya rabari devi apane kadavaahat bhare prachaar se rajg kaa dhyaan bantane main safal rahi hai? kya ve bihar rajg kii yojanaon ko lekar vaaki ek khatra hai?vastav main ve is kaam main to safal rahi hai ki rajg netaa unke bare main sochen or unke vivaadaaspad prachaar kaa jawaab dene kii jugat karen
 And no one can deny the fact that Rabri and her husband Lalu Prasad Yadav are facing a lot of difficulty
 jahaan ek ore, nitish apni sarkaar kii sushasan sambandhi saakh ko lekar saatven aasmaan par hai or bhaajapa apane majboot gathbandhan ke saath unke peeche he, vahiin party ke vidrohiyon ko shaamil kar congress kuch dharmanirpeksh vot apane paale main laane kii taiyaari main he
 But there are more challenges
 kai vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki rabari ek acchhee cellsvuman ho sakati hai lekin rajd-lojpa kaa prachaar karnaa kharaab utpaada bechney jaisaa he
 But Rabri was not deterred by this criticism
 jawaab kii darkaar rakhte hue ve sawaal karti hai, ''haa, main rasoi main khaanaa banaati hum
 i look after my husband and children
 mahilaayein hoti kisalie hai? lekin, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki hamen ghar main band kar diya jaae, jaisaa ki modi ji mujhase chaahate hai? mahilaayein pashu nahin hai, kya hai?'' bheed jor ke saath isse asahmati jataati he, jabaki jansabha main maujuud zyaadaatar auraten kahati hai-''bilkul nahin, bilkul nahin
 "rabri roars while shaking hands amid dusty heat waves," then teach the BJP a lesson
 '' unka ishaara bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ke us suzav kii ore tha jisamen unhone rabari ko rasoi tak simit rahane kii salaah di thi
 It is clear that in response to Rabri's personal attack on Nitish, Modi made the attack on him non-effective
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki dopaher kii garmi ke baavjood rabari kii jansabhaon main jamkar bheed jute rahi he
 Rabri Devi says in cautious words, "nitish Kumar likes to be called 'good Governance Babu'"
 lekin kahaan he badlaav? koi ek to badlaav bataao
 "she is always successful in giving a strong message about" Laluji and coalition partners "
 beshak jatigat ganit rajd-lojpa gathbandhan ke hit main najar aata ho lekin jad (you)-bhaajapa gathbandhan 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii apeksha is baar adhik majboot he, 2004 main upie gathbandhan ko loksabhaa kii 29 siton par jeet mili thi
 As far as the vote percentage is concerned, the rjd-led UPA coalition is 43 in Bihar
 35 fisadi (rajd 30
 67, LJP 8
 19, or congress 4
 49 per cent) of the votes while the nda's total vote percentage was 36
 93 fisadi (jad-you 22
 36 and BJP 14
 57 fisadi) rahaa tha
 Even staunch supporters of the RJD believe that this time there is very little chance of repeating the history
 agar rajnatik samikarnon ke ek mote anumaan se aage badhkar dekhen to rabari devi main aayaa yah badlaav bihar kii varg aadhaarit raajnneeti main kaaphi ubhar kar aayaa he
 Although Lalu is still the cause and inspiration of what Rabri does, but he seems to have made a different point of his own
 ab rabari lalu ke sahyog kii darkaar rakhane ke ulat unki sahyogi ke rup main najar aati hai
 It is no wonder that he ranks second after Lalu in the rjd's list of most wanted star campaigners
 unke prachaar daure bhi kaaphi mahatv rakhte hai kyonki lalu ke ulat ve kisi kii bhi irshyaa yaa nafrat ke nishane par nahin hai
 She is like an elder sister to the common villagers
 ve or unki apil jatigat samikarnon se pare he
 It is clear that a housewife has transformed into a fire-breathing goddess over the years
 vaaki yah us mahila ke liye ek bahut bada parivartan he, jisaki ankhon main july 1997 main mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke dauraan aansu the
 There was a time when Lalu had to ask Rabri Devi to shake her hand from the chopper window and greet the public after the public meeting
 unhen hameshaa hi jhijak or pratirodh kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 Today, she uses separate helicopters and promotes alone
 samay badal gaya he
 With his overwhelming support for Sadhu Yadav's move to expel him from the party, he has given "saheb" a chance to live alone with Ram Vilas Paswan by holding the election campaign alone in Bihar
 ujiyarpur main helicopter dharti ko choote hi ''rabari devi jindabad'' ke naaron se khet gunjyman ho jate hai
 They are put on garlands which they take very politely, as well as warn supporters who are pushing them to touch their feet
 jald hi ve manch par baith jaati hai, or phir taiyaar ho jaati hai un tippaniyon ke liye jinke chalate unhen in dinon khub suna ja rahaa he
 For the second time in the Yogi government, the power rate will fall on the farmers suffering from economic crisis, the price of electricity will also increase for the farmers, but the cost of electricity in Uttar Pradesh will be very high
 vajah he ki ek to unhen samay-samay par fasal kii kharabi se aarthik nuksaan sahanaa padataa he or ab unhen mahangi bijli kharidni padegi
 Many farmers in the state prefer to irrigate by running electric pump sets because of expensive diesel
 magar yogi sarkaar kii ore se tubewel or pump set ke bijli chargeej bhi badha die hai
 According to the new rate, currently the rate of Rs 150 per BHP of private tubewell and pump sets has been increased to Rs 170
 isi tarah minimum chargeej ko bhi 150 se 160 kar diya gaya he
 At the same time, rural agricultural consumers will now have to pay 15 percent more bills
 ab 50 rupee kaa nayaa lagane vaala fiks charge bhi dena padegaa
 Electricity became expensive for the second time Electricity in Uttar Pradesh has become expensive for the second time
 varsh 2017 main yogi adityanath sarkaar ne nikaay chunaav ke bad 12
 It was decided to increase the price by 73 percent
 ab phir phir aath se 12 pratishat bijli badhottaree kaa karant janata ko laga he
 According to the new rates, if consumers with two kilowatt connections use two hundred units of electricity, then they will have to pay Rs 101 more per month
 shahari ilaake kii bijli daren 12 pratishat tak badhaai gayi hai
 Vaidya said, "rahul Gandhi's speechwriters are less intelligent, they do not know about Sangh, if Rahul wants to know about Sangh, then seek the cooperation of intellectual people

 Happy happy birthday / p>— Sania Mirza (@mirzasania) February 5, 2018wishing @juniorbachchan (abhishek Bachchan) a very happy birthday Senior Congress leader Sriprakash Jaiswal has said that the Gujarat government's return of five crores of rupees would not atone for Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's sin of supporting communal powers for four years, so if he really did it to Nitish Kumar But if they regret, they should break the alliance with BJP immediately
 kol india limited ke ek kaarykram ke baad samvaadadaata sammelan main kendriya koyala env sankhyikeey tathaa kaarykram kriyanvayan rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) shriprakash jaisawal ne aarope lagaaya ki bihar chunaavon ko dekhte hue hi vahaan ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne gujarat sarkaar dwaara chaar varshon purv barh raahat ke liye diye gayi paanch crores rupee lautaaye hai
 But in this way, Nitish cannot prove his sin by just returning five crores rupees after holding communal powers for four years
 unhone kaha ki yadi vastav main chaar varsh baad bhi nitish kumaar ko bhaajapa jaisi sampradayik party se gathbandhan kii galati kaa ehsaas he to unhen tatkaal usase apana gathbandhan tod dena chahie
 In response to a question, Sriprakash said that JD (U) cannot wash away the black spots of his hands

 This will not have any effect on the fares of local trains

 Actually, the Railway Ministry took this decision so that the minimum ticket price of the train can be brought at par with the platform ticket
 isi saal rail bajet main plateform tikat paanch rupee se badhaakar 10 rupee kii kar di gai thi

 nunatam kiraaye main badhotaree ke peeche duusari vajah yah he ki bahut se log sirf plateform par jane ke liye hi train kaa paanch rupee vaala tikat kharid lete the
 This used to trouble the passengers engaged in the line to buy tickets

 grih mantri pi chidambaram ne mumbai hamalaa maamle main jamaat-ud-daawa ke pramukh hafiz said kii rihaai ko ‘behad dukhad ’ bataate hue aaj kaha ki uske khilaaf jaanch jari rakhane ke ‘‘paryaapt or kaaphi ‘‘ saboot hai

 Chidambaram was asked during a meeting with Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab and other accused of the Mumbai attacks at a training camp about Saeed's involvement with "major General Saab" and possible contacts with the Pakistani Army
 unka jawaab tha ‘‘yah jaanch se pataa chalegaa
 He said that we have never denied the government-funded elements (involvement)
 haalanki pakistan kahata rahaa he ki sarkaar se itar ugravadi tatv isamen lipt the
 We have never denied the involvement of government-funded elements and we have never accepted the distinction between government-funded and non-governmental elements because both Pakistanis carry out activity from the ground
 kya pakistan main sarkari santhaan ‘‘kisi tarah ’’ jaanch par ‘‘pardaa daalane ’’ main lipt hai is par unhone kaha pardaa daalana kaaphi kathor shabd he (lekin) kai ajeeb kaaran hai masalan jaanch ko jari rakhane kii anichhaa

 saamaajik kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki robert wadra ne dlef ke saath unke rishton ko lekar puche gayi sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya he

 Reacting to this, Kejriwal said, 'robert Vadra has questioned our motive which is not important
 unhone hamaare sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya he
 Half truth and half lie in response to DLF: Kejriwal, Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law, Vadra today dismissed the allegations leveled against the business relationship with DLF as completely false, baseless and derogatory
 wadra ke saath kiye gaye saude paardarshee: dlfdielaepa ne shanivaar ko in aaropon ko khaarij kar diya tha ki usne 43 varshiya wadra ko sarkaar se phaaydon ke aivaj main bina guarantee ke dhan diya gaya tha

 The Union Cabinet has decided to give 10 per cent reservation for poor upper castes and leave the political Shigufa
 iske liye sarkaar mangalvaar ko samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak laa rahi he
 But the age of this politically stormy bill will be only a few months, its apprehension has started to appear soon after the cabinet decision
 sansadeey maamalon ke jaankaar logon kaa kahana he ki samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke liye sadan main vyavastha honi chahie
 That is, there should be peace in the house and there is no noise
 iske alaava sadan main sadasyon kii sankhya (543) kii do tihaai upasthiti or samarthan anivaary he
 If it is not, then the bill will not pass
 sutron kaa kahana he ki endie ke kai ghatak dal or kuch anya party bhi sadan main shor-sharaaba kar yah samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak atka sakate hai
 If in any way this bill is passed from here, then it is almost certain to hinder it in Rajya Sabha because the government does not have majority in Rajya Sabha
 yadi rajyasabha main vidheyak kisi vajah se atakta he to phir 16 loksabhaa bhang hone ke saath hi yah vidheyak khatm ho jayega
 Many opposition mps say that the government is bringing this bill only for political gains
 haalanki kisi bhi dal ke liye is vidheyak kaa sidhe taur par virodh karnaa kathin he lekin yadi yah loksabhaa se paas hokar rajyasabha main aata he to vahaan vipakshi dal isamen sanshodhan kii maang kar bill ko atka sakate hai
 Since the government has talked about 10 percent reservation, the parties that want to get it stuck will not allow the bill to be passed by seeking to increase the reservation by 10 percent or cut the income limit
 kul milakar is vidheyak kii jindagi 16veen loksabhaa tak hi he
 Only after the completion of the budget session (mid-february) will the 16 Lok Sabha be adjourned indefinitely and with this happening the existence of the bill will end on its own

 Team India captain Virat Kohli was very excited about this series
 sakaaratmak soch ke saath unhone is siries main australia ko maidan main chunauti dene ke iraade se apni ranneeti taiyaar kii thi

 jis viraat ne unhen dost kahkar maidan main aamantrit kiya tha, ab vahi kah rahe hai ki siries shuru hone se pehle maine jo tha kaha, galat sabit ho gaya
 Before the Pune Test on 22 February, Virat said in a press conference - We are good friends off the field

 But i know where i should draw the line of friendship
 maidan main jaruri nahin ki unke khilaaf asli bhai kii tarah khelun
 Virat's perception changed, after the Dharamshala Test on March 28, he said yes
 
 
 unke prati meri dharna badal chuki he
 Everything i said in the beginning was to make the series competitive
 lekin main puri tarah galat sabit hua
 Now you will never hear me say this to me again
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir in 34 dinon aisa kya ho gaya, jisase viraat kaa man badla1

 zyada jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen
 It does not take any time to recover from the havoc that nature has caused in the entire Uttarakhand
 kudarat kii sabase zyada maar kedarnath jhel rahaa he, jahaan mandir ke alava dur-dur tak kuch or najar nahin aata
 The Kedarnath temple survived the havoc of nature, but now there is neither a priest nor a devotee of Baba here
 is bich baba kedarnath kii panchmukhi pratimaa ko guptkashi ke vishwanath mandir laayaa gaya he, jahaan se baba kii pratimaa ukhimath pahunch gai he
 Although the festive statue of Baba Kedarnath is brought to Ukhimath in winter, but due to the sudden destruction, Baba has reached Ukhimath before time
 uttarakhand ke khubasurat pahaado ke bich bhagwaan kedarnath based hai
 The faith here is age old and the temple of Lord Shiva is centuries old, but the devastation caused by cloudburst changed the picture of Kedarnath
 kedarnath dham samudratat se 3584 meter kii oonchaai par he
 It gets cold for six months, the Kedarnath temple is covered with snow
 isi ke chalate chah maheene bhagwaan kedarnath ke kapaat band rahete hai
 During this time, Lord Kedar sits in Ukhimath, but due to the havoc caused by nature, Baba Kedarnath is being brought to Ukhimath before time
 kedarnath kii utsav pratimaa ko april maheene kii akshay tritiya ko kedarnath laayaa jaataa he, jiske baad mandir ke kapaat 6 maheenon ke liye aam bhakton ke liye khol die jate hai
 The kapat closes on the day of Kartik Purnima, after which the Panchamukhi statue of Kedarnath is brought to 'ukhimath' for six months
 darasal, 23 june kii shaam baba kedaar kii utsav pratimaa guptkashi ke vishwanath mandir pahunchi, jahaan puja ke baad raat bhar baba kedaar kii pratimaa ko mandir vishwanath mandir main hi rakhaa gaya or tadake hi baba kii pratimaa ko ukhimath le jaaya gaya he
 On the other hand, debris in the Kedarnath temple complex is filled in large quantities
 mandir ke ‘garbhagrih’ tak malbe kaa ambara laga he
 Debris has come to the 'swayambhu Jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva', due to which only a part of the Shivling is visible
 gupkashi main baba kedarnath kii utsav pratimaa ke bare main purohit jaiprakash shukla ne kaha ki jis devbhumi main kedarnath kii mahima kii gunj kabhi band nahin hui, us kedarngari main pichley 8 dinon se mahavinaash or maut kii khamoshi he
 Neither the bell of the Kedarnath temple rang nor the shout of Bhole Bhandari was heard for the last 8 days
 shiv ke dham main ab bhi laashen bikhri padi hai
 The orgy of Mahavinash is visible everywhere
 kedarnath hi nahin aadha uttarakhand is mahavinaash kaa shikaar ho gaya, lekin bhagwaan kedarnath mandir kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin hua
 Even after facing such a huge catastrophe, the temple still stands like it was centuries ago
 log jahaan ise sthapaty kaa kamaal kah rahe hai, vahiin aise logon kii bhi kami nahin jo ise kedarnath kii mahima se jodakar dekh rahe hai
 The Kedarnath temple is not just a symbol of our faith, but also a witness to the history of many centuries of the country
 basna, ujadana to kudarat kaa niyam he
 The way to reach Kedarnath is closed, but in this country full of reverence, the strength of Shiva devotees is also nothing
 aaj nahin to kal shraddhaluon ke liye phir se bhagwaan kedarnath ke darshanon kii raah ban hi jaaegi

 ' Kangana's two year old film 'I Love New York' is being released this week
 yah vahi film he, jisaki release ke Kangana sent a notice to the t series against him, but Kangana changed her stance in the case and said, 'bhushan Kumar is my good friend

 ' is hafte kangana kii do saal puraani film 'ai lav neuyork' release ho rahi he

 i had objections to the old film, but now that the film is released, i will not oppose it
 ' The Bilaspur High Court of Chhattisgarh has rejected the bail plea of pucl's Netabinayak Senatha and Calcutta businessman Piyush Guha
 sen or guha rajdroh ke aarope menajivan karavaaski sajaa kaat rahe hai
 a division bench of Justice TP Sharma and Justice RL Jhanwar in the Bilaspur High Court dismissed the application after hearing the bail application of Sen and Guha
 sen or guha kii jamaanat kii arji par sunwaayee puri hone ke baad buudhvaar ko nyaayalay ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 After the court proceedings began on Thursday, the bench informed Sen to dismiss his bail application
 nyaayalay dwaara sen kii jamaanat kii arji khaarij karne ke baad unke vakil mahendra doobe or binayak sen kii patni ilina sen ne kaha ki ve ab ucchtam nyaayalay main jamaanat kii arji daakhil karenge
 Ilina Sen said that she will now go to the Supreme Court and for this she is in talks with her lawyers
 vahiin sen ke vakil mahendra dube ne kaha ‘chunki hamaari arji khaarij ho gai he or nyaay prakriya ke tahat upachaar uplabdh he, isaliye ab ham ucchtam nyaayalay jaaenge tathaa vishesh anumati yachika bhi daayar karenge
 Strict security arrangements were made in the court premises in view of Sen's decision on bail application
 faisle ke dauraan sen ke parijan nyaayalay parisar main maujuud the
 The court in Chhattisgarh's Raipur district had on 24 December 2010 sentenced PUCL national vice-president Binayak Sen, Calcutta businessman Piyush Goha and Naxalite leader Narayan Sanyal to life imprisonment in the sedition case
 sen or gooha ne rajya ke ucch nyaayalay main nichali adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf tathaa jamaanat ke liye arji lagaai thi
 Senior advocate Ramjethmalani, on behalf of Binayak Sen, had pleaded during the hearing in the court and described the allegations against Sen as politically motivated
 jethmalani ne kaha tha ki chhattisgarh jansuraksha kanoon par unhen aapatti he kyonki is kanoon main kisi vyakti kii suraksha kaa khyaal nahin rakhaa jaataa
 At the same time, this law is also under question
 maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon ne is kanoon ke khilaaf ucch nyaayalay main rit yachika daayar kii he
 He had said that Binayak Sen has been sentenced for treason
 aisa prathit ho rahaa he ki sakshya police dwaara banaae gaye hai jinpar bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The whole matter seems politically motivated

 Ranjana Choubey, wife of Superintendent of Police VK Chaubey, who was killed in a Naxalite attack in Rajnandgaon, had also filed an intervention petition against Binayak Sen's bail application
 sen kii jamaanat kii arji kii sunwaayee ke dauraan europea union ke kaaryakarta bhi nyaayalay parisar main maujuud the jinhen raipur or bilaspur main vibhinn sanghathanon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha

 There is a two-phase election in Uttar Pradesh
 rajya main chunaav lard rahi sabhi rajnatik partiyaan qamar tod mehnat kar rahi hai
 Road after round, election rallies and small meetings continue
 maidan main utari sabhi rajnatik partiyon ke paas unka siem cheharaa he vahiin bijepi yah chunaav piem modi ke chehre par hi lard rahi he
 This is the reason that every few days, some leader of the BJP either calls himself the 'perfect CM' of the state
 kayaas yah bhi lagaae ja rahe hai khudako siem bataane vaale yaa siembanane kii ichha rakhane vaale ye netaa hi chunaav main party kii naiya dubo sakate hai
 Yogi Adityanath
 inkaa naam is list main isliye liya ja saktaa he ki yogi ji do din pehle tak khud ko upi kaa ’parfect siem' bataa rahe the
 While talking to journalists, he counted all the qualities that a CM should have
 haalanki buudhvaar ko lakhanu main patrakaron se baat karte hue yogi adityanath ne kaha ki raajnneeti unke liye seva he or jab tak man lagegaa wo isamen rahenge
 Going further, Yogi said in an interview to a newspaper that Rajnath Singh is the CM candidate
 wo kabhi is res main the hi nahin
 Due to these overt statements of Yogi, the discussion has become hot in the political corridor that he is angry with the party leadership on anything
 agar ye kayaas sahi hai to chunaav ke vakt yogi kii naaraazgi bijepi ke liye mushkil khadi kar saktaa he
 According to Rajnath Singh media reports, the party wanted to make Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh its face in the UP elections, but Rajnath Singh was not ready for this
 rajnath singh upi kii raajnneeti ke puraane maahir khilaadi rahe hai
