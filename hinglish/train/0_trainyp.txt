 MNS Supremo Raj Thackeray has taken a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his close aide Amit Shah
 kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhan ke dauraan raaj thakare ne ek chutkula sunaakar modi kaa majaak udaaya
 In jokes, Modi has been compared to a husband who makes big promises to seduce his wife
 raaj thakare haal hi main bijepi adhyaksh bane amit shah par bhi nishaanaa saadhane se nahin chuke
 Raj said Amit Shah is not a 'rocket' to be 'launched'
 raaj thakare emenes ke chaatr sangh ke kaarykram main bol rahe the
 Significantly, Raj Thackeray often makes headlines by making controversial statements
 punjab skool shiksha board ke 12veen ke silebus main itihaas kii kitaab main kiye gaye badlaav ko lekar punjab main siyasat lagaataar garmati ja rahi he
 On Thursday, the ruling Congress and the opposition Akali Dal came face to face over this issue
 akali dal ne apane pradhan sukhbir badal kii aguwai main kor cameti kii baithak bulaakar ye elaan kar diya ki agar silebus main kiye gaye badlaav ko waapas nahin liya jayega or sikh dharm guruon se jude chaptaron ko phir se 12veen kii itihaas kii kitaab main nahin joda jayega to aise main 11 may ko akali dal puure punjab ke apane jila str padaadhikariyon kii baithak bulaakar aage kii ranneeti tay karegaa
 Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal accused the Congress government of Punjab of completely ending the history of Sikh religious leaders and said that on Friday, a delegation of the Akali Dal would also complain to the Governor of Punjab about the issue
 akali dal ke raajnneetik hamalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye punjab kii congress sarkaar ne bhi apane teen mantriyon ko maidan main utaara
 On behalf of the Punjab government, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal, Education Minister OP Soni and Jail Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa made a press conference to introduce the team of Punjab School Education Board, which has prepared this new history book, and the Akali Dal in this case Accused of inciting people's feelings in the name of religion and tricking the general public
 punjab sarkaar ke mantriyon ne kaha ki sikh dharm guruon se jude chapter 12veen kii itihaas kii kitaab se hataae nahin gaye hai, balki ab in chaptaron ko 11veen se hi silebus main shaamil kar liya gaya he, taaki bachche punjab ke sikh dharmaguruon ke bare main 11veen se hi padhai kar saken
 However, on the basis of information received from the media, the ministers of the Punjab government admitted that there are many grammar mistakes in Punjabi in the book and these mistakes will be rectified soon
 agar sarkari bainkon kaa vilay itnaa hi krantikari he to phir bazaar yah kyon kah rahaa he ki yah agle kuch varsh tak bainkon par bada baari padegaa?agar electric vaahanon kii itani jarurat he to phir niti or riyaayaton ke elaan ke baad sarkaar ko kyon laga ki jaldbaaji thik nahin he?yah donon hi siddhant kii kasuti par sau tanch sudhaar hai jaise ki jiesti yaa phir real estate regulator (rera) aadi
 Who will deny their need? lekin yah naamuraad arthvyavastha ajeeb hi shay he
 Timeliness of policies is most valuable here
 vakt kii samaj hi nitiyon ko sudhaar banaati he
 The timing of reforms has deteriorated in the last five-six years
 dawaaen biimaar kar rahi hai or sahare pairon main funskar munh ke bal giraane lage hai
 Why did the banks' big catastrophe just appear? This file has been on the government's table for years
 bainkon ko kuch puunji dekar ek charanbaddh vilay 2014 main hi shuru ho saktaa tha
 Or the results of the latest merger of State Bank (subsidiary bank) and Bank of Baroda (dena bank) would have been awaited
 is samay mandi dur karne ke liye saste bank karj kii jarurat he lekin ab bank karj baantne kii sud chhodkar bahikhaate mila rahe hai or ghaataa badhane ke dar se kaanp rahe hai
 To reduce the loss, duplication in work will end
 bainkon ke paas diposit par byaaj kii dar kam karne kaa vikalp nahin he, jamaa tut rahi he to phir vah repo rate ke aadhaar par karj kaise denge? yah sudhaar bhi bainkon ke halak main funs gaya
 The real estate regulatory bill (RERA) was a major reform
 lekin yah awaas nirmaan main mandi ke samay prakat hua
 As a result innumerable projects were shut down
 duba koun? graahakon kaa paisa or bainkon kii puunji
 Now those who survive will sell houses expensive
 rigerv bank ne yun hi nahin kaha ki bharat main makaanon kii mahangaai sabase badi afat he or yah badhati rahegi, kyonki kuch hi builder bazaar main bachenge
 The automobile meltdown represents the right reforms at the wrong time
 maang main kami ke bich dijal kaaren band karne or nae pradooshan ke niyam lagu kiye gaye or jab tak yah sanbhalta, sarkaar bydaree vaahanon kii divaani ho gai
 They were all needed, but was it necessary to do them all at once? The results are in front
 kai companiyaan band hone kii taraf bad rahi hai
 Another recent decision
 jab share bazaar, arthvyavastha kii buniyaad darkane se pareshaan tha tab us par tex laga die gaye
 Taxes on the market were not low before but they did not suffer much due to better growth
 sarkaar jab tak galati sudhaarti tab tak videshi niveshak bazaar se paisa nikaal kar rupye ko marial haalat main laa chuke the
 There is an improvement in the book of demonetisation principles, but it was not necessary that every economy could afford it
 kaala dhan nahin rukaa
 The cashless economy did not form, but businesses were destroyed
 single yuj plastic band hona chahie lekin vikalp to soch liya jaataa
 In this recession, only plastic is an active small scale industry
 yah faisla is kaarobaar par baari padegaa
 Jan Dhan, Bankruptcy Law, Make in India, Digital India
 
 
 gaur se dekhen to in sab kii timming inhen dhokhaa de gai he
 The GST is the biggest criterion of success and failure of topicality since 1991
 waite yaa vailu aded tex, aaj ke jiesti kaa purvaj tha
 When it was implemented (2005), the country's economy was on the rise
 sudhaar safal rahaa
 Consumption increased and the state coffers were filled
 lekin jiesti jab avatarit hua tab notebandi kii maari arthvyavastha buree tarah ghist rahi thi, jiesti khud bhi duba or kaarobaaron va bajet ko le duba
 That is why tax reforms are reversed in recession
 sudhaar kii samayikta kaa sabase dilachasp sabak rupye ke avamulyan ke itihaas main darj he
 The rupee was devalued twice after independence
 ek 6
 6
 66 ko jab indira gandhi ne rupye kaa 57 fisad avamulyan kiya
 After the 1965 war, this decision was reversed and the economy collapsed and the failed Indira Gandhi license went to the permit raj
 doosraa avamulyan 1991 main hua vah bhi 72 ghante main do baar
 After that the Indian economy did not look back
 sudhaaron kii samayikta loktantr se aati he
 Many of the previous major reforms have become troublesome because no communication has been made to those affected by them
 yah samasya shaayad ab tak kaayam he? mandi kii haa-naa ke bich chaar package nyochaavar ho chuke hai lekin kahin koi asar nahin dikhataa
 Tired of finding a connection between disease and treatment, the ravaged industry and the market are now finding the fingers of the government on the pulse of recession

 Then Mamata said that she does not consider him (narendra Modi) the Prime Minister of the country

 The people of India are not stupid

 parche par likhaa tha, 'ulta chor kotwaal ko daante, kisaan kii jameen damaad ko baante', 'congress kaa raaj he jahaan, ghotaalon kii baadh he vahaan'
 The Lok Sabha Speaker, however, warned the opposition yesterday that members should not come to the House by wearing black bands nor show posters and pamphlets
 lekin aaj vipaksh hi nahin balki satta paksh ke sadasyon ne bhi vibhinn naare likhe parche laharaae
 Earlier this morning, even after the proceedings of the House started, the matter arose and amid the uproar of the opposition, BJP Chief Whip Arjun Ram Meghwal, referring to Vadra's alleged Facebook comment, said that he is writing about Parliament on Facebook and How can we be silent? is bare main hamaara visheshadhikaar hanan kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya jaae
 The proceedings of the House regarding Lalit Modi and the Vyapam case were interrupted for the second consecutive day today and no work could be done in the House even today

 The Delhi Election Commission has directed to remove the word 'aam Aadmi' on government schemes, Mohalla clinics and public vehicles
 AAP kaa aarope he ki ayog party vishesh ke liye kaary kar rahaa he
 Dilip Pandey wrote in the letter, 'as it has come to our knowledge, the State Election Commission has directed the Chief Secretary of the Delhi Government to remove the word' Aam Admi 'from all government billboards, government schemes, Mohalla clinics and public transport buses
 chunaav ayog dwaara yah nirdesh hamaare raajnneetik pratidwandi aurambhjhfvidhayak shri vijendra gupta dwaara likhe gaye ek patr ke aadhaar par jari kiya gaya he
 DILIP PANDEY wrote on aap's commission, "the concept of Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinic is like a new revolution in healthcare and this model is being appreciated all over the world
 yah sab jaanate hai ki bijepi jaisi jan-virdohi takaton ne is tarah kii yojanaon ko rokane ke liye kaaphi koshish kii hai or dilli sarkaar ko kaaphi pareshaan kiya he
 It has left no stone unturned to derail the program, but we are shocked that a constitutional body in the form of Election Commission is acting as a subordinate body of some political forces and taking orders from them
 'khat main chunaav ayog par dal vishesh ke liye kaam karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha gaya he ki yah ayog kaa sanvaidhanik kartavya he ki vah sabhi hitdharakon ke liye ek samaan manch ko sunishchit kare or kisi bhi raajnneetik dabaav main na aae
 The question on the words of other parties has been asked by the AAP
 Does this mean that now the commission will order to remove and cover the words 'indian' and 'janata' on government buildings, establishments and billboards as both these words Also included in the name of a political party and the name of that party is 'bharatiya Janata Party'
 isi tarah ayog kya un sabhi bhartiya imaaraton, pratishthanon or billboard se 'indian' or 'neshnal' shabdon ko bhi hataane kaa aadesh degaa kyonki ye shabd bhi ek raajnneetik dal ‘indian neshnal congress’ ke naam ko ingit karte hai?rajya sarkaar kaa paksh jaanane kii apilamaaf pravaktaa ne chitthee main kaha he ki agarayog ko‘aam aadmi’ shabd ko hataane kaa aadesh paarit karne kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hoti he, to aise kisi bhi aadesh se pehle rajya sarkaar or aam aadmi party ko apana paksh rakhane kaa avasar diya janaa chahie

 In response to this, Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said that the Personal Law Board should not impose its opinion on anyone else and do not make it political

 The triple talaq is being linked to the same code of conduct but the main issue is that of the Gender Justice

 Are these questions asked in the style of yes or no, are the questions correct, are there enough questions, do these questions give an opportunity to understand such a serious subject in depth
 kuch sawaal is tarah se puche gaye hai
 
 
 - Will the common civil code benefit people? - kya samaan civil samhita kii zarurat he? - Will gender justice come from this? - kya yah vaikalpik honi chahie? The question is whether people will benefit, then ask if gender justice will come, whether benefit and gender justice are two different things
 ab aapke man main sawaal aa rahaa hoga ki lau kamishan ne jo sawaal puche hai kya wo sirf muslim personal lau se sambandhit puche hai
 There are only a few questions which are related to the Hindu and Christian community, religion is not mentioned in the rest of the questions but they are related to Muslim personal law

 Question number two asks whether the various religious sects are governed by personal law and orthodox practices in India on subjects of the Kutumba method, should a uniform civil code cover all of these subjects or some of them
 jaise vivaah, talaak, dattak grahan, sangrakshakata or bal abhiraksha yani child castady, mentanence, uttaradhikaar, viraasat
 We will try to know that child custody is not a law in all religions regarding succession, there is not a law in all states, will the same civil code also mean that the same law will now apply in all states, will this At the same time the same law is applicable in all states
 hamaara makasad sawaal ko thik se samajhnaa or jawaab jaananaa he taaki is par healdi dibet ho sake jaisaa ki venkaiya ji ne kaha he
 Now the question of divorce in question number two has been asked, then what was the need to ask about three separate divorces in question number seven

 is sawaal kaa samaan civil samhita se kya sambandh he
 Is there any uniform civil code for implementing law commission laws? baat samaan kanoon banane kii ho rahi he yaa lagu karaane kii bhi ho rahi he
 So it should have also been asked why those who demand the Uniform Civil Code also do not share the daughter and sisters in the father's property
 bahut kam aise honge jo hissaa dete hai
 Is the government going to arrange that all the families have to report to the government how much was given to the daughters and sisters while distributing the father's property
 balki sarkaar ise beti bachaao or beti padhaao abhiyaan kaa hissaa bana sakati he
 There will be a revolutionary change in the society

 We will try to know what is the age of marriage in Muslims and to what extent it is followed

 com / amloltd94y— ashutosh (@ashutosh83b)february 6, 2015 The Thackeray family has its own identity in the politics of Maharashtra and no other family has stood up in its parity in the state
 khaas baat yah he ki parivaar satta se dur rahata he, lekin satta uske aasapaas hi rahati he
 As on date, Uddhav Thackeray is the head of the Shiv Sena which is a Hindu nationalist party and this party was formed in June 1966 by his father Bala Saheb Thackeray
 jab tak bala sahib thakare raajnneeti main sakriy rahe to uddhav raajnneetik paridrishy se lagbhag dur hi rahe yaa phir unke peeche hi khadey dikhe
 However, Uddhav used to look after the work of Saamna's newspaper Saamna before taking charge of the party and its editor too
 haalanki baad main bal thakare kii badhati umr or kharaab sehat ke kaaran unhone 2000 ke baad party ke kaamkaaj ko dekhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 During this time he was involved in the election related activities of the party
 2002 kii jeet se badha kadsaal 2002 main brihanmumbai municipal corporation (biemasi) ke chunaavon main shivasena ko joardaar safalataa mili or iskaa shrey unhen diya gaya or unhen janvari 2003 se party kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 Though the journey to this end was extremely challenging for him as his cousin Raj Thackeray was considered the undisputed successor of Bal Thackeray in the party, but due to Bal Thackeray's succession to his son Uddhav, he left the party in 2006 and the new party Formed
 haalanki party par unki 2004 se hi he or vah tabhi se party se jude har bade faisle lete rahe hai
 The low-profile Uddhav Thackeray was surprised when Bal Thackeray was chosen as the successor to the Shiv Sena because people outside the party did not even know his name and Raj Thackeray was known as a possible successor
 27 july, 1960 ko mumbai main janme uddhav thakare ke parivaar main patni rashmi thakare ke alaava 2 bete aditya or tejas hai
 His elder son Aditya is active in politics like grandfather and father and is the national president of Yuva Sena, a youth organization of Shiv Sena
 aditya mumbai jila footbal sangh ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 However, Tejas stays away from public relations as compared to his father and elder brother
 photography kaa shauk59 varshiya uddhav raajnneetik jivan se itar wildlife photography kaa shauk rakhte hai or isse judi dheron pradarshaniyon or paryaavaran se jude kaaryakramon kaa aayojan karte rahete hai
 He has many photo books based on photos which mention things related to the people, life and historical heritage of the state
 haalanki bal thakare ke daur main party maharashtra main hameshaa majboot party ke rup main kaayam rahi or samaan vichaardhaara hone ke kaaran uskaa bhartiya janata party ke saath gathbandhan he
 Before Narendra Modi came to the center in 2014, Shiv Sena used to play the role of elder brother in this alliance, but after this the BJP came there as elder brother
 2014 main vidhansabha main gathbandhan ko jeet ke baad shivasena apana mukhyamantri nahin bana saki
 Uddhav Thackeray split the seat with the BJP for the elections ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections after a long stint with the BJP after 2014
 bijepi 25 or shivasena 23 siton se chunaav ladegi
 Now it has to be seen how far Uddhav Thackeray can take Shiv Sena, who has been continuously questioning the Modi government of the Center for the last 5 years

 aadha darjan pratyaashee tikat waapas kar chuke hai to arvind kejariwal kii dilli main sarkaar banane ke baad 'aap' se jude kaaryakarta bhi ab nadaarad ho gaye hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party candidate Adarsh shastri and Shimla Sri's proponent, who arrived in Collectorate on Wednesday for nomination in Allahabad, went missing
 aadhe ghante prastaavkon kaa intjaar karne ke baad donon pratyaashee namakan sthal se bina parchaa bhare laut gaye
 Shimlashree says that his proposers did not arrive but Adarsh claims that his form could not be filed because the affidavit was incomplete
 donon pratyaashee brihaspativaar ko namakan karenge
 'AAP' candidate from Phulpur, Shimlashree and 'AAP' candidate from Allahabad, Adarsh shastri were to enroll till 12 noon as per schedule
 lekin do baje tak donon namakan sthal par nahin pahunche
 His procession reached the Collectorate around 2:30 pm
 namakan teen baje tak hona tha
 At half past two in the afternoon, both the candidates came and stood at the Collectorate Gate
 kaaphi der tak vahaan tainaat afasaron ko samaj nahin aayaa ki donon kiskaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Someone interrupted that half an hour is left, if the form is not filled then you will have to return empty handed
 tokane par shimlashri ne bataaya ki unke das main do prastaavak gopesh treepathi or ashutosh nahin pahunche hai
 Despite this, the candidate Shimlashree went to the DM court and Phulpur returning officer and DM P

 It was told that some proponents of Adarsh did not even reach

 uttar pradesh main purv kendriya mantri anupriya patel kii party apana dal (es) kii mushkilen badhati ja rahi hai, kyonki bijepi apane is mahatvapurn sahyogi ko zyada tavajjo dene ke mood main nahin dikh rahi
 After ignoring the cabinet expansion, BJP is also trying to snatch the Sadar Assembly seat of Pratapgarh from Apna Dal (S)
 jabaki apana dal (es) is seat ko kisi bhi surat main chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Let me tell you that the BJP has fully geared up for the by-elections in Uttar Pradesh's 13 assembly seats
 bijepi pratapgarh kii vidhansabha seat par khud ladane ke mood main he or isaki taiyaari bhi sthaneey netaa karne main jute gaye hai
 Whereas in 2017, Sangam Lal Gupta of Apna Dal (S) won this seat
 lekin 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kaa daaman thamkar pratapgarh sansadeey seat se vah jeet darjkar sansad pahunche he, jiske chalate pratapgarh kii sadar seat rikt hui he
 Apna Dal (S) leader Anupriya Patel could not find a place in Narendra Modi's central cabinet this time
 iske baad haal hi main uttar pradesh kii cabinet vistaar main bhi ashish patel jo ki anupriya patel ke pati or party ke adhyaksh hai unhen jagah nahin di gai
 While the discussion of his becoming a minister was very loud
 bijepi ne apana dal (es) ko ek ke baad ek do jhatka dene ke baad ab teesraa jhatka dene main juty he
 BJP can take its Sadar Assembly seat in Pratapgarh from Apna Dal (S)
 aise main agar bijepi pratapgarh seat se apana ummidavaar utaarti he to uttar pradesh main sabase badi sahyogi apana dal (es) ke liye behad mushkilon bharaa daur hoga
 After this, there will be pressure on Apna Dal (S) to prepare a separate political path
 apana dal (es) ko lagata he ki bijepi unhen apni rajnatik takat se dabaa rahi he or party ke bheetar iskaa nakaaratmak asar pad saktaa he
 Right now both parties are silent on this issue, but the check-up between the two continues
 is chuppi se apana dal (es) ke bheetar badi hui bechaini saaf dikhaai de rahi he
 However, Apna Dal (S) is currently in the mood for weight and watch
 aise main pratapgarh kii sadar vidhansabha seat par bijepi khud se koi faisla karti he to phir soobe main gathbandhan main daraar padana laazmi he, kyonki anupriya patel kisi bhi surat main is seat ko nahin chhodana chaahati he
 However, along with BJP, Apna Dal (S) is also preparing for this seat

 People are surprised to see this house being built on the first floor of a pucca house in Kalankpur village in Balod district
 yah gharapradhanmantri awaas yojanake tahat nirmit ho rahaa he
 All formalities have been completed even before its construction
 sarkari ricardmein khanaapurti karne ke baad afasaron ne is pakke ghar ke upar pradhanmantri awaas banane kii sweekruti de di
 This house belongs to the influential person of the village
 ghar ke logon kaa sattadhari dal se kareeb kaa naata he, lihaaja afasar meharbaan hai
 On the other hand, there are 265 families in this village who are homeless
 147 parivaar aise hai, jinke ghar mitti se bane hai
 All these Prime Ministers have been pushing for months to get accommodation
 unako afasaron ne kah diya he ki kota khatm ho chukaa he
 Something can be done for them in the new financial year itself
 sthaneey logon kaa aarope he ki pradhanmantri awaas yojana main hitgrahiyon kaa chayan unki dayaneey haalat ko dekh kar nahin ho rahaa he, balki unke chehre ko dekh kar ho rahaa he
 After the complaint of the people, the administration has assured to investigate
 chhattisgarh main pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat hajaaron aavedan prayek jilon main pending pade hai
 In the sorting of applications, only those who have political connections get priority
 aam insaan ke liye pradhanmantri awaas tedi kheer sabit ho rahe hai

 An official says that Jagarani Devi neither speaks Hindi properly nor Bhojpuri due to being less educated and old, but her actions have taken her message far into the society
 unhone kaha ki aaj ye donon mahilaayein samaaj main misaal ban gai hai
 It is noteworthy that there are a total of 1519 houses in Konhwa Panchayat, out of which about 600 houses were devoid of toilets till a few months ago
 gram panchayat ke mukhiya manoj kumaar bhi khule se shouch mukt hone par prasannataa jataate hue kehete hai ki aaj is kaary main panchayat kii mahilaon ne kaaphi bad-chadhakar hissaa liya, mehrun or jagaranee ne to puure rajya hi nahin, desh ko ek sandesh diya he ki jajba ho to koi kaam mushkil nahin

 masjid memnmajpadhana kyislamka aantarik hissaa he yaa nahin?supreme courtis par faisla sunayega
 On this issue, BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj said that there was a temple of Ram in Ayodhya, and there is no doubt about where the grand Ram temple will be built
 saath hi unhone kaha ki jahaan tak namaaj padhane kii baat he, namaaj kahin bhi padhi ja sakati he, train main, sadak par, stesan par, kahin bhi namaaj pard lete hai
 Sakshi Maharaj said, 'for the last 1 month i have been requesting the Honorable Court that the decision should come soon

 They are also offering namaz anywhere in the train, on the road, at the station

 'unhone kaha ki duniya kii koi takat ayodhya main masjid nahin bana sakati
 There are many mosques in India, will offer Namaz anywhere
 ayodhya main mandir he, vahaan namaaj nahin padhi ja sakati
 The decision came in 1994 according to which Hindus got the right to worship there
 sakshi maharaj kaa kahana he ki desh ke koti-koti hindu kaa yahi kahana he ki vahaan par bhavy ram mandir bananaa chahie or ram mandir banakar rahegaa usko koi roak nahin saktaa
 In 1994, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court directed the Ismail Farooqui case to maintain status quo in the Ram Janmabhoomi case so that Hindus could worship
 bench ne ye bhi kaha tha ki masjid main namaaj padhanaa islam kaa jaruri hissaa nahin he
 In fact, before hearing the title suit, the main case of ownership of disputed land in Ayodhya, the court will decide on the matter whether the Namaz is an integral part of Islam or not

 mukhyamantri anandiben patel bhi kah chuki hai ki rajya sarkaar aarakshan se judi apni sakaaratmak niti main patelon ko shaamil karne ke liye koi badlaav nahin kar sakati
 Patel, who owned 14 per cent of Gujarat's population of around six crore, was once a farmer owning agricultural land, who later joined businesses such as diamond polishing
 lekin ab unka kahana he ki unke yuvaaon ko uniwarsity str kii padhai or sarkari naukariyon se dur rakhaa ja rahaa he, or aisi jatiyon ke logon ke liye arakshit kar diya gaya he, jinhen zyaada pichhadaa samajha jaataa he, or jinhen mukhyadhara main laane kii zarurat samajhi jaati he
 Hardik Patel says that Narendra Modi, who has now become the Prime Minister of the country, failed to create such a model of development in Gujarat during his 13 years of chief ministership, which benefits all castes and classes
 iske bajaae vah aisi nitiyaan banaate rahe, jinase bade vyapaaron or vyapaariyon ko phayda pahunche
 Significantly, the Congress and other opposition parties have also blamed the ruling BJP
 patel samudaay kaa kahana he ki ab tak gujarat ke vikaas main unke dwaara bainkon main lagaaye gayi paise kaa bahut bada yogadan he lekin ab jab unhone aarakshan ko lekar awaz uthaai he to unki baat nahin suni ja rahi
 If they withdraw money from the banks, the government's pace of development will decrease, then the government may have to listen to their voice
 tippaniyan At present, this program is happening only in the Sabarkantha district, but Hardik Patel, the emerging leader of the Patel movement, has now appealed to the state government for economic co-operation by joining all the Patels of Gujarat in this program
 aise main sarkaar bhi chintaa main he ki agar rajya ke sabhi patel samudaay dwaara is tarah ke kaarykram kiye jaayenge to nai musiibat khadi ho sakati he
 It is important that the state Chief Minister Anandiben Patel had a discussion with Hardik Patel, Lalji Patel and other agitating leaders on Monday, but such an agitation is intensifying due to no result in it, which is a matter of concern for the government is
 gujarat kii lagbhag chah karod kii aabaadi main 14 fisadi hissedari rakhane vaale patel darasal kabhi khetihar zameenon ke maalik kisaan hua karte the, jo kalantar main hiron kii polish karne jaise kaarobaaron main shaamil hote gaye
 But now he says that his youth are being kept away from university-level studies and government jobs, and has been reserved for people of such castes, who are considered more backward, and who need to be brought into the mainstream It is understood
 hardik patel kaa kahana he ki ab desh ke pradhanmantri ban chuke narendra modi 13 saal ke apane mukhyamantritv kaal main gujarat main vikaas kaa aisa model taiyaar karne main vifal rahe, jisase sabhi jatiyon or virgon ko laabh pahunche
 Instead, he kept making policies that benefited big businesses and traders
 gauratlab he ki yahi aarope congress tathaa anya vipakshi dal bhi sattashin bijepi par lagaate rahe hai
 The Patel community says that till now the money they have invested in banks has contributed a lot to the development of Gujarat, but now when they have raised their voice for reservation, they are not being listened to
 agar wo bainkon se paisa nikaal lenge to sarkaar kii vikaas kii gati kam ho jaayegi, tab shaayad sarkaar ko unki awaz sunani pade
 The comments philhal to ye kaarykram sirf sabarkantha zile main hi ho rahaa he, lekin patel andolan ke ubhar rahe netaa hardik patel ne ab gujarat ke sabhi patelon ko is kaarykram main judakar rajya sarkaar se aarthik asahakaar kii apil kii he
 In such a situation, the government is also worried that if all such programs are done by all the Patel community of the state, then new trouble may arise

 aapane kai baar suna hoga ki police kii vardi utaar lee gai, vardi utar gai, vardi chin lee gai
 But have you ever seen a policeman after taking off his uniform from himself, just in tow in Saawariya style? Believe me, whoever saw this scene was stunned with shame
 kya karen tasviir he hi aisi
 
 
 a Delhi Police soldier comes out of his house every morning before leaving for duty, only in towels
 phir vahaan se har guzarane vaale ke saath uskaa tauliya khulata or band hota jaataa he
 While taking off the towel in Sanwaria's dance, the hero is backing towards the camera, while this young man is naked in front of the camera and that too on the middle road
 dilli police ke sipaahi jayadev singh malik central dilli ke dariyaganj thane main thainaat hai
 Now the heat is so high in Delhi that even these towels are not stuck
 par yahaan tak to thik he, lekin iske aage ye kya?dilli police ke saanwariyaa, tauliya vaale saanwariyaa apane kapade aisa utaarte hai ki badan par kuch bache hi nahin? agar inhen utaarani hi he, to apane ghar ke andar utaaren, koi kuch nahin kahegaa
 But the person who protects the common road, common roads and the safety of the common people himself, does such acts that shame should also be blamed
 jism par police kii vardi, haath main bandook or kandhe par lau and order kii zimmedaari
 
 
 So this is Delhi Police Constable Janab Jaidev Singh Malik on duty in Dariyaganj, a crowded area of delhi
 consteble malik apane ilaake main aksar yun hi apana farz nibhaate nazar aate hai
 But the question is, when Zaanib Malik is not on duty, what do he do? Malik is seen in a very different style in the Mansarovar Park area, about 15 km from Daryaganj
 police consteble jayadev singh malik kii tasviir khule camere se nahin, balki sisitivi camere se lee gai he, kyonki malik rozaana jis haal main dikhte hai, us haal main wo yakeenan khud ko khule camere main kaid karne kii izaazat nahin de sakate
 Seeing these pictures of Mr
 Jayadev Singh Malik, for the first time, no one is shocked, but says that the pictures do not lie
 so, malik ne jo kuch kiya, sisitivi camaron ne saafe kar diya
 Date: 03 May 2013 Time: 06:17 AM in the morning Place: Mansarovar Park, Delhi Early morning Malik's activities outside his house are part of his daily routine
 jism par mahaz ek tauliya lapete malik rose apane ghar se baahar nikalataa he or baahar nikalne ke baad kuch 'is' tarah rose apane padosi ke ghar ke saamne peshaab karata he
 After this, not only the towel remains standing outside the house for hours on the pretext of cleanliness, but also the women and all the people living in the time-old neighborhood, by opening the towel, show their naked body
 sawaal he ki akhir malik ke sir par nangepan kaa yah kaisaa bhoot savaar he? akhir kyon wo rose subah yun hi apane ghar ke baahar saream nanga hokar khadaa ho jaataa he? akhir kyon wo is besharmi se rozaana apane padosi ke ghar ke baahar peshaab karata he? aakhir kyon uske padosi or mohalle ke duusare log malik ko rokane kii himmat nahin kar pate? to janaab, jab aap consteble jayadev singh malik ke nangepan kii puri kahani janenge, yakeen maniye chaunk jaaenge
 The act of this constable is disturbing not only his neighbors but also the people of the entire region
 wo rose ghar se baahar nikalataa he or apane padosiyon ko dekhakar nanga ho jaataa he
 Now what is this craze? What madness is this? Nobody could understand
 padosiyon ne dilli police ke is saanwariyaa ko sudhaarney kii tamaam koshish kii, lekin wo apni harkaton se baj nahin aayaa
 Eventually, the police had to take help of the camera to expose the policeman
 taarikh: 03 may, 2013vaqt: subah ke 06 bajkar 17 minutedilli police ke consteble jayadev singh malik rose kii tarah subah-subah apane ghar se baahar nikalataa he
 At that time there was nothing more than just a towel on his body
 ittefaq se tabhi pados main rahanevaale ek bujurg shaks bhi apane ghar se baahar nikalate hai or malik apana tauliya kholkar besharmi se bujurg ke saamne khadaa ho jaataa he
 But it is said that when the front man comes down to bareness, he has to be ashamed of himself
 lihaaza, bujurg shaks malik ke saamne se hatana hi thik samajhate hai
 But this is not a one day thing, but for the last almost two months, Malik has been doing such acts without leaving Naga everyday outside his house
 aaie, ab malik kii kuch or karatuuton par nazar daalate hai
 
 
 Date: May 15, 2013 Time: 03:00 am 52 minutes Elderly Satpal, who lives in the neighborhood of Malik, goes for a walk from his house every morning and this day Malik is urinating outside his house just before he leaves her house
 do din baad bhi malik kaa ravaiya jas kaa tas he
 First he urinates at the door of his neighbor's house and then pornographic activity
 
 
 taarikh: 22 may, 2013vaqt: subah ke 06 bajeis rose bhi malik subah-subah ghar se baahar nikalate hi apana tauliya kholta he or phir uski ashleel harakatein shuru ho jaati hai
 As usual Malik is present outside the house on this day in a single towel
 tabhi pados ke makaan main ek ladkaa aata he or use aate dekhakar malik ek baar phir vahi harakat karata he or yani tauliya kholkar uske saamne khadaa ho jaataa he
 Date: May 28, 2013 Time: 6 o'clock in the morning, but this day, like all limits are over
 pehle to bike kii saafe-safaai ke bahaane tauliya pahana malik apana tauliya kholta he or padosiyon ke saamne hi ashleel harakat shuru kar detaa he
 Gradually, time passes and the movement of people starts on the road
 lekin dilli police ke is consteble kii harakatein jari rahati hai
 And as Malik crosses all his limits, when he sees the neighbor's neighbor on the balcony, he again takes off his towel and starts gesturing
 lekin ab malik kii harkaton se aaziz aakar jahaan uske padosiyon ne uske khilaaf report likhavai he, vahiin auraten bhi apana munh kholane lagi hai
 By the way, you are probably thinking that the people around will probably keep silent due to fear due to Malik being in the police, but it is also a surprise that the neighbor from whom Malik is doing such activities to take out his girlfriend, he He himself has been in the Delhi Police ever since and his son is still working as a Sub Inspector
 lekin yahaan ronaa is baat kaa he ki police bhi apane hi mahakme ke mulaazim ke khilaaf mahakme ke logon kii hi fariyaad nahin sun rahi he
 Now obviously you must be wondering why Malik does this? So the answer lies with the retired sub-inspector of Delhi Police itself
 unki maane, to malik ke saath property ko lekar unka purana vivaad chalaa aa rahaa he, lekin ab malik aisi giri hui harkaton par utar aayaa he
 But see, after being caught on CCTV camera with his petty antics, Jaydev Malik is making an unconscious appearance and is calling it an conspiracy against him
 ulta apane ghar ke paas gundgardee or nangepan par utraa jayadev malik khud ko apane hi padosi ke zulmo-sitam kaa shikaar bataa rahaa he
 However, after seeing Malik's antics in CCTV photos, it is not difficult for anyone to understand who is telling the truth and who is lying
 The police had earlier registered a case against Malik under mild and surety sections, but after trying till date, on Saturday, the police against Malik, along with non-bailable sections, as well as the Prevention of Child from Sexual Offenses, ie POSCO Under the case, he has been arrested
 vaise dilli police ke consteble jayadev singh malik kii harkaton ko dekhakar ranbir kapur kii film saanwariyaa ke tital trek kii yaad bhi aa sakati he
 However, Apna Sipahi is neither Ranbir Kapoor nor any sanvariya song is being filmed here
 par bhai hai ki saanwariyaa style se baaj aane kaa naam hi nahin le rahe

 Book Name: Exile Writer: Taslima nasreenprakashkar: Vani Prakashan: Hard bound edition Rs
 395 a woman who rejects the world, which left her or her retreat from which she had suffered and cheated
 ek aurat jo inkaar kar detii he samaaj ke adeshon, uski reeti-rivaajon or paramparaon ko maanane se
 a woman who repeatedly teaches to falter, fall, be thrown, to stand upright, to walk the one whose staggering steps teach her, which leads her astray
 dhire-dhire vah mahasoos karti he apane andar ek nayi chetana ke vikaas ko, ek saadhaaran sa vichaar baandh letaa he use- 'yah jindagi uski khud kii he, kisi or kii nahin
 She can rule it only by herself, no one else '
 yah us ladki kii kahani he jo nikal ai he pitrusatta kii bhatti se, chamakate steel kii tarah
 This story is of Taslima Nasreen
 tasalima nasrin bharat main apane upanyaas 'lajja' ke kaaran charchaa main ai thim
 After the release of this novel, Taslima had to go through a variety of restrictions
 apane is dard ko vah shaayad hi bhul paaengi
 She describes something like this in her autobiography 'exile'
 
 
 vaastavik duniya main ek haad-maance kii aurat ke liye manaahi he daawa karne or dhithaayee se ghoshnaa karne kii- main wo ladki hum jo un vigat dukhadaayi, ashaant varshon ke baad, aaj phir se uth khadi hui hum
 i have pledged to live such a life as i want
 kyun duniya sweekaar karegi aise saahas ko? kisi bhi aurat ko aisi spardhaa shobhaa nahin detii
 i am totally unsuited for this patriarchal society
 
 
 
 In my country, Bangladesh, in my own West Bengal, i am a forbidden name, a law-aborted woman, a forbidden book
 koi meraa naam nahin ucchar saktaa, mujhe chhu yaa pard saktaa he
 If they do so, their tongues will rot, their hands become dirty, filled with deep hatred
 main isi tarah kii hum or yahi rasta chunaa he maine'
 Taslima's life journey so far has come as an autobiography
 'nirvaasan' us siries kaa 7waan bhaag he
 In 'exile', Taslima has tried to keep all her experiences, pain, deception from her acquaintances, accusations and politics in installments
 aatmakatha ke is bhaag main tasalima ne bangla sahitya jagat main apni upasthiti or vahaan ke kai sahityakaron ke saath apane bebaak sambandhon par bayaan tathaa apane nirvaasan ke daur kaa byoraa pesh kiya he
 It is the pages of Taslima's life, not books
 in par likhaa hua keval wo log samaj sakate hai jinhone jindagi ke bavandar ko apane sharir par jhela he
 If the history of a person or a society goes through the pages before it is recorded, if you want to know, then read this book

 22 farvari yani aaj indore main ek shaadi he
 This marriage is different from other marriages in many ways
 aap bahut si shaadiyon main shaamil hue honge or aapane duulhe ko ghodi par, car main aate hue dekha hoga
 You must have welcomed the procession many times
 lekin indore ke ek ghar main jo baraat aa rahi he wo alag he, sabase juda he
 Because in this procession, the groom is neither riding on the mare nor in the car
 wo strechar par let kar aa rahaa he, or strechar par lete-lete phere legaa
 This wedding, which takes place on 22 February, is different in many ways
 aap soch rahe honge ki ladkaa biimaar hoga or shaadi kii taarikh tal nahin sakati isliye wo philhal strechar par aa rahaa he or shaadi ke baad sab thik ho jayega
 but it's not like that
 wo ladkaa pichley paanch varshon se strechar par he
 In an accident, his entire body was paralyzed and his entire part of the neck is no longer moving
 pichley paanch varshon se wo jinda laash bhar he
 But five years ago, he was a healthy boy laughing and when he was a healthy boy, then he had befriended this girl
 donon ek-duusare se pyaar karne lage the or tabhi ye durghatana ghat gai
 The boy survived, but the doctors said that he could never stand on his own feet
 is haadase ke baad ladki ke gharavaalon ne apni beti par ladke ke ghar jane par roak laga di
 The boy's parents also sternly denied that the girl could not meet their son
 lekin ladki ne haar nahin maani, usne apni padhai jari rakhi
 Got a job and stood on my feet
 daftar aate-jate wo ladke ke ghar jaati
 The boy's parents do not let him meet the boy
 lekin ladki ne kabhi kuch nahin kaha
 She would go home, sit outside like this
 aakhir ek din ladke ke buudhe maa-baap kaa dil pigal gaya
 He allowed the girl to meet him and the girl met the boy
 ladke kaa puraa sharir lakwagrast he
 The girl would meet him and both of them would talk, many things
 muhabbat kii baaten, gujarey hue palon kii baaten or baaten
 Everyone explained a lot, telling the girl that her life would be ruined
 lekin ladki kisi kii sunne ko taiyaar nahin hui
 He did not want anyone else's company
 use chahie tha, bas vahi jiske saath usne kabhi pyaar ke chaar pal gujaarey the
 After all, the girl and the boy's parents obliged and due to this consent, today, on 22 February, the girl will get a chance to meet her desire, forever
 ladke ke buudhe maa-baap ne to shaayad isliye hami bhar di ki unhen baad main lagane laga ki unke peeche kam se kam ladki unke bete kaa dhyaan rakhegi or ladki ke maa baap ke paas apane paanv par khadi ladki kii chahat ke aage jhukne ke sivaa koi doosraa chaara hi nahin bachaa tha
 i do not know what will be the outcome of this marriage, but i want to know what name i will give to this relationship? If you have any answer, then definitely give it
 intjaar rahegaa

 bosbos aksar parfectionist hote hai, kyonki agar vartanee main thodi-si galati ho gai, to bos se baas aane lagegi
 If the students studying in the convent write in Hindi, then the boss can also be bamboo
 lekin convent main padhe chaatr bhala hindi main bos kyon likhenge? isliye bos kaa baans kabhi nahin ho saktaa
 Rather, the fact is that the person who is in the most ideal state of bamboo is the boss
 bos angreji kaa shabd he
 But changing the language does not change the character of the boss
 hindivaale ilaakon ke sarkari daftaron main bos ko padaadhikari kaha jaataa he
 That is, here also means the person who can bamboo, the boss and the officer who can get the rights
 bos posetive energy se labarej hote hai
 a good boss never listens to an employee and never says yes to anything
 adarsh bos hameshaa loktantric hota he
 Many bosses are so democratic that they give employees the option to have opinions on everything they say
 ab ye karmchaaree par nirbhar karata he ki wo bahut acha kahe yaa phir sirf acha kahe
 The boss always has a habit of listening very well to his decision
 lekin udaar bos ke faisle ko koi sirf acha bhi bataaye, to vah zyada bura nahin maanata
 The entire atmosphere of the office becomes extremely dignified as soon as the boss arrives
 kaam hi puja he, is lihaaj se daftar mandir he
 But the life of the temple comes only when the auspicious phase of the boss falls
 bos ke aate hi chaay ke khaali cap dustbin main chale jate hai
 Walking workers move to their seats and people playing computer games on the chair open the excel sheet and sit with such patience that the boss has to say that if the eyes remain pierced like this, the power of the glasses will increase
 gardan akad jaaegi or ek din aspondilitis ho jayega
 But the boss says nothing of these
 wo zyaadaatar namaskaron ko nazarandaaz karke, kuch namaskaron par halke se sir hilaakar, kuch hello par sweet or kuch hello par noti-si smil paas karte hue dandanaate hue apane cabin main chale jate hai
 Employees look blessed
 is umr main ye energy level! phir man-hi-man khud ko samajhaate hai, bhuule se bhi inaki umr kii baat kisi or se mat karnaa
 Otherwise the job will go away
 karmchaariyon se bhare daftar main 50 gaj kii duuri bos is andaaz main paar karte hai, jaise duniya kaa mahanatam ballebaaz idan gardence stadium main dressing room se nikalakar maidan tak kaa safar tay karata he, yaa phir america kaa raashtrapati teesri duniya ke kisi desh kii ek din kii yatra ke baad apane special bowing kii taraf badhata he
 a good boss has a solution to every office problem
 lekin vah kabhi hal khud nahin bataata balki karmchaariyon se poochta he
 Some bosses are so straight forward that they simply say that the boss only has questions, not answers
 lekin karmchaariyon ke liye to bos hi apane-aap main ek sawaal hota he
 a question is not a boss, there are many questions
 aakhir ab tak kaise tikaa hua he? management ko isane kya ghutti pilaa rakhi he? shaam ke vakt jab offis se nikalataa he, to isaki gaadi parking se baahar dur kyon khadi rahati he? gaadi main pehle se koun baitha hota he, vagairah-vagairah
 Curiosities annoy the boss because the boss has a deep sense of everything and most of the rest of the office is nonsense
 sens hone ke saath bos main gajab kaa sens of hyaumar bhi hota he
 If the boss smiles, the entire office blossoms and if the boss ever lashes out, then the office turns into Gabbar's base
 hansee us vakt tak rukne kaa naam nahin leti jab tak bos kii hansi tham nahin jaati
 a good boss's relationship with their subordinates is usually of dissatisfaction
 karmchaaree bos ke vyavhaar se asantusht hote hai or bos karmchaariyon ke kaam karne ke tareeke se
 Along with rejecting the work or ideas of the employees, the bosses also reprimand them as appropriate
 lekin puure daftar main do-chaar log hi ye samaj pate hai ki bos or karmchaaree kaa rishta kumhaar or ghade kii tarah hota he, jo khot nikaalata he to sirf uske bhale ke liye
 Those who understand this matter have a lot of progress
 aise log khud ko gadaa or bos ko kumhaar rupi guru maanate hai
 But the rest of the office calls him the boss's spoon
 bos tarah-tarah ke hote hai
 Some bosses in the private sector are nirguna and formless
 kab daftar aate hai or kab jate hai, ye kisi ko pataa nahin chalata
 Many bosses run entire offices through e-mail sitting somewhere in America, Europe or Bangalore
 duusari taraf sarkari bos niraakaar nahin hote balki aakaar main itane bade hote hai ki kursi main mushkil se samaate hai
 Most bosses in the private sector are fitness freaks and go to the gym
 duusari taraf sarkari daftaron ke bos gym ke badale `jimne’ main yakeen rakhte hai
 The bosses of government offices live so much that the Babu people of the office have to collect goods in their name from morning to evening
 lekin sarkari bos kaa pet nahin bharta
 He has an air disorder, but he is a circulator of government offices

 lekin bujurg the, dame ke marij the, pichley saal guzar gayi
 The rest is no one else around, i am the only Lokpal
 mukhiya ji ne kaha, phir to tumhaara daawa pakkaa
 Anna Hazare was saying that the whole country is not looking for a strong Lokpal
 fouran tikat kataao or dilli ravaanaa ho jaao
 The train was crowded
 lokapal kisi tarah latakta hua dilli pahunchaa
 As soon as he stepped into the station, he came to know that the whole of Delhi is waiting for him and there is also a big water in the Ramlila ground to welcome him
 bina vakt ganvaaye lokapal ne sidhe ramlila maidan kaa rukh kiya
 There were posters on the walls - Lao Lokpal, save the country
 lokapal ne man-hi-man mukhiya ji ko daad diya or aage badhkar us aadmi tak pahunchaa jo jor-jor se naaraa laga rahaa tha— aakar rahegaa lokapal
 'yes i have come,' the Lokpal said adamantly
 lekin naaraa lagane vaale ne lokapal kii baat jaise ansuni kar di or phir galaa fadkar chikha, aakar rahegaa lokapal
 The crowd also repeated the slogan - Lokpal will remain
 'lekin lokapal to aa gaya he
 Just as strong as you guys wanted
 ’'ain ye aadmi kya bol rahaa he, sarkari lokapal kii tarif kar rahaa he
 Seems like an agent of Congress
 are, bhai wo lokapal nahin aayaa jise ham dhundh rahe hai
 Sit them on the side, they want to disturb the program
 ’do kaaryakarta lokapal ko kinare le gayi or bheed main bitha diya
 The Lokpal kept watching Jalsa silently for a while, but it was unbearable for him not to be recognized in front of the world
 aakhirkaar uske sabar kii seemaa tuuti he or wo jor se chikha- main lokapal hum
 The workers then reached out to him and explained that this was the wrong slogan
 mat kaho ki main lokapal hoon
 Say me too Anna, you too Anna
 naaraa lagaao- aakar rahegaa asli lokapal
 Lokpal said, sir, when i have already arrived, how can i say that i will come and stay
 jab main lokapal hoon to khud ko anna kaise kah saktaa hoon
 It is very messy here, now i have to meet Anna Hazare directly
 badahavaas lokapal ramilala maidan main anna ke manch tak pahunchne kii koshish karata rahaa, lekin subah se shaam ho gai
 Then it was announced that Anna is going on a hunger strike after the government's assurance
 jhola jhanda uthaakar bheed baahar nikalne lagi, lekin maayoos lokapal ramlila maidan ke kone main khadaa rahaa
 He neither got Anna nor a grain of grain
 gurudware main chaar din bitaakar lokapal gaanv lautne vaala hi tha ki do logon kii baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki anna lokapal ko laane ke liye mumbai main anshan kar rahe hai
 The zealous Lokpal of District Jind, village Khaprauli caught a Mumbai car without wasting any time
 mrdi maidan main kadam rakhte hi lokapal ko ye pataa chalaa ki anshan par baithe anna ji kii tabiyat achaanak kharaab ho gai he or ab wo kisi se nahin milenge, naa to media se naa apane samarthakon se
 The Lokpal tried hard, but no one allowed him to meet Anna
 shashakt lokapal kii majbootee ko parakhe bina anna mumbai se pune ravaanaa ho gayi
 When the looted Lokpal returned to the village, the chief told him that Anna should be ho-na-ho but the common man's leader Arvind Kejriwal needs you to bet
 dhun ke pakke lokapal ne ek baar dilli kaa rukh kiya
 But on reaching Delhi he came to know that a very strong Lokpal has come in the Parliament, just like Anna wanted
 lokapal ko chakkar aa gaya
 Kejriwal was looking for him
 pataa bataaya anna ne or lekar aaye congress or bijepi vaale
 But he is standing on the road, where is the Parliament? Astonished, confused Lokpal moved towards the Parliament, but in security, the policemen drove him away with a stick
 lokapal rota-peethta insaaf ke liye kejariwal ke ghar pahunchaa
 When he introduced the workers posted outside, the workers explained - Don't say Lokpal, say I'm a common man
 lokapal to bahut marial he, kejariwal ko uski zarurat nahin he
 They need a strong Jan Lokpal
 lokapal gash khaakar gir padaa
 Many months have passed
 shahdara ke paagalakhaane main badi dadhi or fate pyjame vaala ek aadmi jor-jor se cheekhta he, kabhi kahata he, main lokapal hum
 Then says
 main janalokapal hum
 Sometimes he says, i am also Anna, you are also Anna
 kabhi kahata he, main aam aadmi hum
 Doctors say that this unnamed person has a disease called 'multiple Personality Disorder', which can never be cured
 aage ke panne par padhein, 'maatrubhaasha' or 'budhaape kii lathi'3
 Mother tongue is the language in which one remembers the mother and sisters of others, that is their mother tongue
 maatrubhaasha kii ye ek sahaj sweekaarya paribhaasha ho sakati he
 But in India, the trend of using foreign language to remember strangers is continuously increasing
 ab gaaliyaan bhi angreji main di jaati hai
 Hence the definition of mother tongue has changed something for us
 thodi-bahut asahmatiyon ke saath ye mana ja saktaa he ki jis bhashaa kii aap sabase zyada maan-bahan kar saken, vahi aapaki maatrubhaasha he
 If we fit this piece, there is no doubt that Hindi is the mother tongue
 desh aaazaad hua to hindi mata ko sarkari baabuon ke hawaale kar diya gaya gaya
 The babus said - Mai, don't worry
 ab har jagah tumhaara hi raaj hoga
 An officer will be appointed in every government office to take care of you
 jiskaa kaam blikeboard par rojaanaa tumhaare naam kaa ek shabd likhnaa or har saal14 sitambar ko tumhaare sammaan main ek kaarykram yojit karnaa hoga
 The Hindi officer will also occasionally organize a poet conference for you
 jisamen aanevaale kaviyon ko rail kaa kiraaya or rahkharch diya jayega
 Dekhna mai, how people will cheer you up from Kashmir to Kanyakumari through government efforts
 hindi ne kaha, abhi meri umr hi kya he
 Why do you make me mai by putting a dot on my forehead
 main apni raah khud chal sakati hoon
 But the babus said, how can Mataji do this? aap apni raah chalengi to hamaari naukari kaa kya hoga
 How will conferences be held in your name in India and abroad
 netaaon or baabuon ko fokat main videshyatra ke avasar kaise milenge or phir ham aapaki hi seva to kar rahe hai
 But where Hindi was going to stay, started moving at its own pace
 gujarat or maharashtra parkar jaise hi dakshin kii taraf badi bavaal shuru ho gaya
 The sons of Hindi mother will be pitnel from place to place from Madras to Madurai
 sinboard mitaaye jane lage
 Political slogans were made against Hindi
 ye sab dekhakar ghabaraaye chachaa nehru ne apane baabuon kii khabar lee,`tumlogon se kaha tha, hindi mata ko istarah belgaum mat chodo
 What work of Hindi mother in the area of tamil Amma
 unhen pataa nahin ki ilaaka kitna dangeras he
 If something happens to him and his sons, what answer will i give to the whole country
 chachaa nehru ne puure desh ko samajhaayaa ki thik he, hindi hamaari maan he
 But the number of mauses in different states are also equal
 mausiyon ko hindi mata se koi bair nahin
 But i cannot say anything about my cousins
 isliye sidhaa rasta yahi he ki hindi mata baabuon kii nigaraanee main aaraam farmaayen
 Do not go out from your heartland
 chachaa nehru ne desh se ye bhi kaha ki ye hargiz mat bhuulo ki tumhaari ek pitrubhasha bhi he
 In Indian society, father's status is greater than mother
 hameshaa maan kaa pallu pakade rahoge to jindagi main kuch nahin kar paaoge
 Mother tongue is suitable for listening to Lori
 bharat main rahakar roti kamanaa chaahate ho to angreji siikho
 The whole country followed the path shown by uncle
 nateeja ye hua ki har jagah angrejiwale ke baap kaa raaj kaayam ho gaya or hindi mata housewif ban kar rah gai

 budhaape kii lathive bistar par pade the
 The injury was very deep, low on the body and too much on the mind
 sankat kii is ghadi main zyaadaatar apane unka saath chhod gayi the
 There were few sympathies and tears were being returned on his condition
 dard had se guzar chukaa tha
 The injury was incurable
 kyonki ye chot kisi or chiz kii nahin balki budhaape kii lathi kii thi
 There is no voice in the sticks of the upper, but there is a lot of voice in the sticks of old age
 budhaape kii lathi jab bajati he to puri duniya ko pataa chal jaataa he
 This great truth of life was well understood in his understanding
 lekin ab pachhataane kaa kya laabh, lathi to pad chuki thi
 There was a time when he often used to say - lathi is good governance
 lathi anushaasan he
 The lathi is indigenous
 lathi swaavlamban he
 Sticks are power
 lathi aan, baan or swabhaamin he
 He had a huge contribution in the academic thinking on sticks in the country

 During the Emergency, he also fought for the restoration of democracy
 phir unhen lagata tha ki lathi he, tabhi loktantr he, varna sab berok-tok tantra he
 He was always in favor of giving oil to lathi and giving him dignified honor
 haalaanki, ve nahin maanate ki budhapa kabhi aayega
 Nevertheless, he was preparing a stick of old age for himself, just like every Indian does
 log unhen usee tarah chetavanee de rahe the, jaise padosi or rishtedaar dete hai—jamaana bahut karaab he
 There is not even faith in real children
 aapaki budhaape kii lathi bahut belgaum he
 So keep it safe, do not let it rain on you instead of becoming a support in old age
 unka jawaab hota tha, ye lathi belgaum nahin balki lagaam lagane ke liye he
 He did not know how many taunts, how many words he had suffered due to the sticks of his old age, but he did not leave the sticks to drink oil
 ve anginat basant dekh chuke the
 The companions were passing one by one
 lekin unke din bahut maje main guzar rahe the
 There was still as much hair on the head as there were twenty years before
 jhurriyaan ek baar padane ke baad jaise ruk-si gai thim
 The voice was still as high as it was thirty-forty years ago
 puraa desh maanata tha ki ek vahi hai jo puure desh kaa sammaan or swabhimaan bachaa sakate hai
 Because they do not have to refrain from using sticks and driving when needed
 unki party 13 din, teraa maheene or paanch saal ke liye teen baar satta main ai
 He became a minister, then a Deputy Prime Minister, but the time came to become Prime Minister, so why not know why his father-in-law was waiting in his name
 party unke netritv main vijay kii ore prasthaan karne vaali thi lekin naa jane kaise filgud dushmano kaa ho gaya
 Now if iron or iron man remains idle for a long time, then rust starts
 lekin ve badan par lagane vaale jang ko mustaidi se jhaadte rahe or agle chunaav kaa elaan-e- jang bhi karte rahe
 He once again gave the slogan of this time and jumped into the ground on his own
 lekin hai! muaa ‘in vatting’, is baar bhi saath chipka rahaa
 He kept banging his head on his failure
 udhar lagaataar tel pikar tandoorust ho chuki unki lathi lagaataar sanasanaati rahi, jaise kah rahi ho, are mujh par chhodiye, main dikhaata hoon virodhiyon ko din main taare
 The voice of the lathi was such that even the antagonists were afraid of themselves at times
 ve do koshishon main naakaam ho chuke the
 The election was coming again
 piem in vatting se in vatting hataane kaa boodha sapana unke man main ek baar phir aahista-aahista jawan ho rahaa tha

 The old man should do Hari Bhajan while staying at home

 Now he had the support of old age sticks
 ummid thi, lathi kaa sahaara lekar ve 7 rescorse main daakhil ho jaayenge
 The sticks will handle whatever comes on the way
 lekin unki lathi ab lathi nahin rah gai thi, balki latth ho gai thi
 The power of Uncle Chaudhary's Bhimsaini Lutt and the charisma of the magic wand of Tauji who killed enemies by flying himself, both contained in the sticks
 parivaar waalon ne samajhaayaa, ye lathi aam budhaape kii lathi nahin he balki ab aisa swachaalit hathiyaar ban chuki he, jo kisi ke chalaane se nahin balki apane aap chalati he
 The strength needed to hold that stick is no longer in you
 chupchaap ghar baithiye or ram kaa naam lijiye
 But he was angry
 parivaar ne unhen manaaya
 They agreed
 lekin kuch din baad phir ruuth gayi
 The family celebrated again
 lekin ve is baar maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 He went ahead to stop the stick of old age
 lekin jaise haath lagaaya, jaise karant laga
 It was beyond his capacity to handle this stick
