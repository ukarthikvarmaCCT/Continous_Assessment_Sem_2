 co / ronjknqavy— Ashwin Ravichandran (@ashwinravi99)25 disambar 2016 Only one person knows when and how Mahi's style appears, and that is Mahendra Singh Dhoni himself
 siries ke pehle mukaable main dhimi ballebaaji ko lekar puri duniya dhoni kii aalochana kar kahi thi
 He was being questioned, but by the end of the third ODI (3rd ODI) series against Australia, Dhoni finished all the questions and said that when it comes to chasing runs
 , So there is no addition to them
 is maamle main unki viraat kohli (virat Kohli) se lambey samay se res chal rahi he, lekin siries khatm ke baad dhoni ne sabit kiya chej ke master to vahi hai
 51 in Sydney 55* in Adelaide 87 * in Melbourne @ msdhoni is the Player of the Series! # ausvindpic

 com / vbdzxt9mse Explain that in the three ODI series that ended, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was the second most successful batsman after Shaun Marsh by combining both teams
 lekin ausat ke maamle main maahi ne sabhi ko patakekhni de daali
 Dhoni was the second most successful batsman after Shaun Marsh with 193 runs
 vahiin ausat ke maamle main shaun marsh maahi ke aas-paas to kya aadhe ke aankade tak bhi nahin pahunch sake
 Where Dhoni 193
 00 kaa ausat nikaala, to marsh kaa ausat 74
 It was 66
 chauthe sthaan par rahe viraat kaa ausat 51
 00, so Rohit Sharma's average 61
 66 kaa rahaa
 However, Mahi once again showed that he has no match in chasing the target
 isko lekar viraat or dhoni ke prashansakon hi nahin duniya bhar ke cricketpremiyon ke bahes chalati rahi he
 Let me tell you that in the total matches of his career, Virat has 97 in 78 innings
 98 ke ausat se 4899 ran banaae hai
 But Dhoni is heavy on Virat in terms of statistics
 dhoni ne apane kariyar kii 73 pariyon main 103
 Leaving Virat behind by scoring 2783 runs at an average of 07 and told that the Guru is the same from Chase
 vastav main lakshya kaa peechha karte hue sau se upar kaa bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki jab team lakshya kaa peechha karti he, to dhoni kis mizaaj or str ke ballebaaj hai

 (input IANS) (input ieenes) You must have heard about a lot of incidents of theft or robbery at atms so far
 lekin kabhi kisi aisi ghatana ke bare main suna he jahaan chor hi aap par dayaa dikhaa jaae? ji haa, aisi ghatana jahaan chor hi taras khaakar aapako paise lautaa jaae
 The case is from China's city of Haiyan
 jahaan ek mahila ATM se apane paise nikaal rahi thi, usee dauraan ek chor aayaa or usne mahila ko chaaku dikhaaya
 The thief snatched money from the woman by showing a knife
 dar se mahila ne jitne bhi paise ATM se nikaale hue 2500 Yuan (kareeb 26 hazaar bhartiya rupee) de die
 But he was not considered a thief, he insisted on withdrawing more money from the woman
 saath hi kaha ki wo apana bank balance dikhaae
 Chorhamila, snatching money from the woman, obeyed the thief and started showing the remaining money in the bank to the thief, but as soon as the balance screen appeared, the thief's heart melted
 chor ne dekha ki mahila ke bank acount main ab ek bhi rupaya nahin bachaa he
 Seeing all this, the thief took pity on the woman and gave her 1500 Yuan (about 16 thousand Indian rupees) back without harming the woman
 chor ke is achche vyavhaar ke baavjood use police ne pakad liya
 But on social media, people are sharing the video after praising this thief
 technology ko lekar duniya japan kaa loha maanati he
 But did the Japanese engineers build a magnificent bridge in just 24 hours? The photo of a Japanese bridge is becoming viral on social media, claiming that the bridge was constructed in just 24 hours
 ravivaar kosthhe Engineer bronama ke ek fasebuk pej ne is daawey ke saath yah photo share kii he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim to be false
 is post kaarkivd varjan yahaan dekha ja saktaahai
 Posted by The Engineer Bro page, this photo was shared by more than 3000 people till the time of writing the news and more than 25,000 people also liked it
 aapako yah bhi bataa den ki is fasebuk pej ko 30 lakh se zyada log follow karte hai
 The post has a caption written in English above the photo, which will be translated into Hindi, "japan erected the bridge within 24 hours of its collapse in a natural disaster
" bharat main aisa karne ke liye pehle to prakriya main 3 saal lagate phir pu l banane main 5 saal alag
 To investigate this claim, "what is the truth" AFWA first cropped this photo and then did a reverse search with the keyword 'japan'
 hamen isi daawey or photo ke saath bahut si anya post milin, jinamein ek japani bhashaa main kiya gaya ek twit kaa link bhi tha
 This tweet named tt_expwy was posted by Twitter on November 11, 2018
 japani bhashaa ke kiye gaye us twit ke anuwaad se pataa chalaa ki yah pul japan ke rashtriya root rajmarg 305 par bana he jo japan kii phukui kshetra kii echigen tat rekha par sthit he
 The bridge was indeed demolished in the tragedy but this tweet did not reveal the time period of its construction
 AFWA ne phir japani text ko google par search kiya to ekajapani news reportmili
 a translation of an article found on this Japanese website, named Greengo, revealed that a portion of this National Highway 305 was demolished following a landslide on July 7 last year
 is lekh main yah bhi bataaya gaya ki is pul kaa nirmaan 27 agast ko shuru hua or 31 oktober ko ise janata ke liye khol diya gaya
 This means that the construction of this bridge took two months
 iske alaava, traasadee se lekar rasta behaal hone kaa bich kaa samay lagbhag 4 maheene he
 This proves that there is no truth in the fact that this bridge is ready within 24 hours of the demolition

 Only after this, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has bluntly told the party mlas that now we will not lift the palanquin but this time the Shivsainik himself will sit in it
 ab agar uddhav thakare ke chehre ke saath shivasena bijepi se baat karti he to vah ek nai shuruyaat ho sakati he

 com / fohgy11gxx The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the appointment of Justice RA Mehta to the post of Lokayukta by Gujarat Governor Kamla Beniwal, saying that the post had been vacant for nine years and it shows the state of the state
 sheersh adaalat ne iske saath hi yah bhi kaha ki rajya sarkaar se paraamarsh ke bagaiyr hi is pad par niyukti ke sambandh main rajyapal ne ‘apni bhoomika kaa galat akalan’ kiya
 a constitutional crisis had arisen in the state due to sharp differences between Modi and the governor over Mehta's appointment to the post of Lokayukta
 modi sarkaar ne ucch nyaayalay main ise chunauti dete hue kaha tha ki mantriparishad kii salaah ke bagaiyr rajyapal lokayukta niyukt nahin kar sakate hai
 The Governor claimed that his decision was based on consultation with the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court

 The apex court said that in such cases the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court has to be given prominence
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ‘‘vartmaan rajyapal ne apni bhoomika kaa galat akalan kiya or unki daleel thi ki kanoon ke tahat lokayukta kii niyukti ke maamle main mantriparishad kii koi bhoomika nahin he or isliye vah gujarat ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish or vipaksh ke netaa se paraamarsh karke niyukti kar sakati hai
 Such an attitude is not in line with the democratic system envisaged in our Constitution
 ’’ The judges said, "the Governor consulted the Attorney General for a legal opinion and corresponded directly with the Chief Justice of the High Court without taking the Council of Ministers into confidence
" is sambandh main unhen yah galat salaah di gai thi ki vah rajya ke mukhiya ke rup main nahin balki sanvidhik praadhikari ke rup main kaam kar sakati hai
 '' nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki is maamle main tathyon se spasht he ki paraamarsh kii prakriya puri ho gai thi kyonki mukhyamantri ko mukhya nyaayadhish ke saare patr mil gaye the or aisi sthiti main niyukti ko gaiyrkanoonee nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 The apex court said that the Chief Justice had noted the objections of Chief Minister Narendra Modi and in such a situation there is no need to cancel the appointment
 rajyapal kamala beniwal ne pichley aath saal se lokayukta ke rikt pad par 25 agast, 2011 ko nyaayamurti mehta ko rajya kaa lokayukta niyukt kiya tha
 The comments nyaayalay ne nau saal se bhi adhik samay se lokayukta kaa pad rikt rahane par aprasannataa vyakt kii or kaha ki is maamle ke tathy rajya kii chintajanak tasviir pesh karte hai jahaan lokayukta kaa pad nau saal se bhi adhik samay se rikt he
 The court also objected to the High Court's strict remarks against Chief Minister Narendra Modi and said that he is of the opinion that even if the judges did not accept the Chief Minister's attitude as correct, they should have maintained restraint and had such harsh language against the constitutional authority Should not be used
 nyaayamurti mehta kii niyukti kii vaidhata ke sawaal par ucch nyaayalay ke do nyaayadhishon main is maamle main matbhed hone ke kaaran tisare nyaayadhish nyaayamurti ve em sahay ne apana faisla sunaaya tha
 In this decision, Justice Sahai criticized Chief Minister Narendra Modi for creating constitutional crisis in the state, saying that the Governor has the right to appoint at his discretion

 Voting was held on Monday in Churu Lok Sabha seat of Rajasthan under the fifth phase of security arrangements
 churu seat par 65
 67 percent of the voting was recorded while a total of 63 in the 12 seats in the state
 73 % matdaan hua
 There are 12 candidates in the fray for this seat in the 2019 elections
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) is baar phir apane maujuuda saansad rahul kaswaan par daanv khelaa he jabaki pichley chunaav main duusare sthaan par rahane vaali bahujan samaaj party ne is baar hari singh ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 Rafiq Mandalia is trying his luck from the Congress
 baharhaal, rajasthan main haal hi main hue chunaav main congress ne satta main vaapasi he, isliye party ke hausale buland hai
 So there is a relief news for BJP that the difference in votes between it and Congress is so low that the party can make up for it in the coming few months
 rajasthan main loksabhaa kii 25 siten hai
 The BJP won the last assembly elections with a huge majority and won all the seats in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin 2018 ke aakhir main hue loksabhaa chunaav main party ko alvar or ajmer kii seat par haar kaa samaanaa karnaa padaa
 The BJP currently has 23 mps from the state
 churu loksabhaa kshetra kii baat karen to yah bikaner sambhag ke antargat aane vaali samaanya seat he
 Churu is also known as the Gateway to the Thar Desert
 churu sansadeey seat ke raajnneetik itihaas kii baat karen to 1977 main gathit is seat par ek chunaav chhodkar har baar jaaton kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 Only the political party changed but the candidate won only the Jat community
 churu loksabhaa seat par ab tak hue kul 12 aam chunaavon main 5 baar bijepi, 4 baar congress, 1 baar janata party, 1 baar bldi, or 1 baar jeenpi (es) kaa kabja rahaa
 In the first Lok Sabha election held in Churu, Daulat Ram Saran as the candidate of the Bharatiya Lok Dal reached the Lok Sabha after defeating former Governor and Congress candidate Mohammad Osman Arif
 vahiin 1980 main daulat ram saaran ne dobaaraa is seat par jeenpi (es) ke tikat par kabja jamaaya
 After this, in 1984 Daulat Ram Saran lost to Mohar Singh Rathore of Congress
 yahi wo pehla mauka tha jab is seat par koi gaiyr jat chunaav jeet paaya
 Later, Congress's Narendra Budania won in the by-elections held after the death of Mohar Singh
 vahiin saal 1989 main daulat ram saaran ne janata dal ke tikat par ek baar phir vaapasi kii
 By the year 1991, the influence of Daulataram Saran started to diminish in Churu, when the BJP nominated Ram Singh Kaswan as its candidate for the first time
 is chunaav main ramsingh kaswaan ne mohar singh rathod ke bete va congress ummidavaar jaisingh rathod ko parajeet kiya
 After this, this seat was held twice by Congress's Narendra Budania
 lekin 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaav main budania bijepi ke ramsingh kaswaan se chunaav haar gaye
 After which Ram Singh was MP from Churu seat for three consecutive terms
 lekin 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne ramsingh kaswaan ke badale unke bete rahul kaswaan ko tikat diya
 Currently, Rahul Kaswan is an MP from Churu
 is lihaaj se pichley chaar baar se lagaataar is seat par bijepi kaa kabja bana hua he
 According to the 2011 census, 75 out of a total of 27,16,040
 45 pratishat hissaa gramin or 24
 55 percent is urban
 vahiin kul aabaadi kaa 22
 35 percent are Scheduled Castes, while 17 percent of the population is of minorities
 iske alawa is seat par shuru se hi jaaton kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 The reason for this is the political awareness of the Jat voters here
 1984 ke apwaad ko chhod den to is seat par hameshaa jat birdari kaa kabja rahaa
 Even if there was a contest between the two Jats, even the Jats rallied behind the candidate who won the vote and did not allow their votes to be divided
 jabaki anya jatiyon ke vot bant gaye
 As per the 2014 general elections, the total number of voters in Churu Lok Sabha constituency is 17,53,825, with 9,28,040 male and 8,25,785 female voters
 churu loksabhaa kshetra rajasthan ke churu or hanumangarh jile ke kuch hisson ko milakar banaaya gaya he
 It consists of 8 assembly seats
 jisamen churu jile kii 6-sadulpur, taranagar, sujangadh, sardarshahar, churu, ratangarh or hanumangarh jile kii 2 seat-nohar or bhaadaraa shaamil hai
 If we look at the data of the recent assembly elections, the Congress has 4 seats in Churu district and BJP has 2 seats
 jabaki hanumangarh ke nohar seat par congress or bhaadaraa seat par sipiem kii jeet hui he
 In this context, out of the total 8 seats in Churu parliamentary seat, 5 are occupied by Congress and 2 by BJP
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne apane 3 baar se saansad ramsingh kaswaan kaa tikat katkar unke bete rahul kaswaan ko tikat diya
 On the BJP ticket, Rahul Kaswan defeated Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Actress Maharishi by a huge margin of 2, 94,739 votes
 jabaki congress ke pratap singh tisare sthaan par rahe
 Rahul Kaswan got 595,756 votes in this election while actor Maharishi got 3,01,017 and Congress candidate Pratap Singh got 1,76,912 votes
 42 varshiya rahul kaswaan churu ke purv saansad ramsingh kaswaan ke putr hai
 He studied bcom and Management from Delhi and is a businessman
 16veen loksabhaa main churu se chun kar aane rahul kaswaan kii sansad main 95 fisadi upasthiti rahi, is dauraan unhone 448 sawaal puche or 117 bahes main hissaa liya

 Sometimes the relationship of love gives us courage, then sometimes this reason breaks us down inside
 har pyaar bharaa rishta nonk jhonk or takaraar bharaa hota he jisamen bahut pyaar chipa hota he
 We see these stories of our happiness and sorrow on many film screen and feel connected to them
 aisa isliye bhi hota he kyonki reel or real life main bahut zyada antar nahin hota he
 Don't know how many films made on love and family have touched our hearts
 haal main ai film 'sultan' main bhi aisi hi ek lav story dikhaai gai he jo hamerishton ko jode rakhaneke kai myne sikhaati he
 Although most people have gone to see it as Salman's fans and may even go to see it, but apart from Salman, this film has a lot to offer
 arafa kii himmat or sultan ke jazbe kii is kahani main ek toote hue rishte kii phir se ji uthne kii kahani bhi dekhne laayak he
 Let us know, these five things which are learned from the love of Arfa and Sultan
 
 
 1
 True love with Arfa connects Sultan to his goal and he grows out of the image of a rejected girl into a successful man
 isliye to kehete hai sachcha pyaar aapako farsh se uthaakar arsh par pahunchaa detaa he
 2
 sultan dil tuutane ke baad bheepyar karnaa nahin bhuulataur jab vah pehali pahalwani pratiyogita jeetta he to uskaa shrey vah arafa ko detaa he kyonki uske kadave shabdon ne hi use aage badhane ke liye prerit kiya tha or vah is baat ko acchhee tarah samajhataa he
 3
 pyaar or profeshnal jindagi main donon kaa talmail tab tak acha chalata he jab tab donon ek duusare kaa sammaan karte hai
 As soon as this thread breaks, their relationship also falls apart
 isliye apane rishte main is kadi ko kamjor na padane den or apane saathi kaa or uski baat kaa hameshaa sammaan karen
 4
 ek mode par aakar donon kaa rishta khatm ho jaataa he lekin pyaar barkaraar rahata he
 The reason for this is their silence
 jab kabhi aisa ho to chup na rahen balik apane dil kii sari baaten apane saathi se kah daalen
 5
 sachcha pyaar kabhi haar nahin maanata or aisa hi hota hearapha-sultan kii prem kahanemen
 When Sultan needs more love with Arfa, she forgets everything and returns
 uski sari galatiyon ko maaf karke uskaa saath detii he or sultan bhi apni galati ke liye usase maafee maangata he
 So always learn to forgive your partner and also make him realize his mistakes
 acid hamale kii cerviver lakshmi agarwal par ban rahi film chhapaak main actress deepika padukon lakshmi kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai
 For this film, Deepika's look has been tried to be similar to Laxmi's
 lekin aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki acid atake se pehle lakshmi kaa cheharaa deepika se miltaa julata tha
 During the conversation with Pinkvilla, the director of the film Meghna Gulzar told that Deepika has always been on her mind for Chhapak
 kyonki unhone acid atake se pehle lakshmi kii tasveeron ko dekha tha jisamen lakshmi kuch had tak deepika jaisi dikhti hai
 However, after the attack, his real face was no longer present
 film main mechap transformation ke baad deepika bahut had tak lakshmi jaisi lag rahi hai

 Meghna told that Deepika has always been her perfect choice for Chhapak
 unhone acid atake se pehle kii lakshmi kii kuch tasviren dekhi jisamen unka luk deepika se kuch had tak miltaa julata tha
 But at that time they thought that perhaps they are thinking so because of their thinking

 "how does one get so much dirt when he takes a bath by himself?" 
 
 ’ khiz bhare dhaul mere pakhore hilaa detaa
 Never been able to tell you, ba! i was afraid of bathing
 bathroom main tere jabardastee dhakelne par nal khol, baaltee se farsh par pani ulich main nahaane kaa sirf swang bhar rachataa tha
 Just used to soak the corner of the towel and wipe it with my hands and hands so that if you touched, i would feel that i had really got out of the bathroom
 tu to samajhati thi ki nahaane ke maamle main main nambari aalsee hum
 How would i break your illusion? i cannot forget the 'kaal-katha' and i am returning to my paper-pen, standing close to Kamatanathkhirkii, but i cannot understand! Why do the clouds of Delhi enter my eyes? jab baahar or bheetar ek saath megh baras rahe hon to tuje likhi jane vaali chitthee shuru kaise ho sakati he?main kaagaj par tere paanvon kii akruti ukerne lagata hum
 You can wonder how these feet can be yours
 mere paas iskaa jawaab he ba! ye paanv hu–ba–hu tere paanv isiilie hai ki maine inhen yahi sochakar ukera he ki tere paanv hai
 Whenever i looked at your tired feet bloated with double bread, i used to get worried
 tere paanv suje hue hai
 No one can see their swelling covered with a sari fall
 maaloom nahin kaise vah mujhe dikhaayi de jaati he
 i interrupt you dinabhar ghar main dolati, bazaar se saag–sabji dhokar laati, devi ke darshanon ko paas main hi he, kahkar mumba devi ke mandir jaati, lagbhag chaar–paanch kilometre kaa chakkar tera roj hi lag jaataa he
 Why don't you hire a servant for help? At home, laughing and avoiding my words would say - You are the one who shakes the legs and pulls their fingers and licks them! If i will not, how will i get that happiness in your little hands? pustak ansh- main hindu kyon hum: shashi tharur ke shabdon main hindu or hinduvadatere paanv ab bhi soojte honge na ba
 How do i lick their fingers? kaise dur karun unki thakaan
 i want to kiss your feet that are swollen with double bread
 unki tisen har lenaa chahta hum
 i want to sleep by putting them on my chest
 haftabhar! nahin, das roj! nahin, salbhar
 No, the whole year
 sanchit kar lenaa chahta hum taumr kii neend
 Whatever you get
 phir chaahe jitani raaten palak jhapakaaye bina gujaren
 Cut while sitting

 Just bear it, i will suffer

 You said on the phone, no! Listen, whenever you feel unhappy, dikra, sit in meditation posture at any time and remember Krishna
 gahare, apni antaratma main utarane kaa prayaas karnaa
 Two to four days, your efforts may prove fruitless, but after practicing yourself a few days you will experience something unique
 krishna kii chhavi shunya ho jaaegi or teri antaratma main tuje kahin se bansuri kii madhyam sureeli dhun sunaayi degi, jo tere us shunya ko saikadon agarbatti kii sugandh se suvasit kar degi
 As long as you remain immersed in the fragrance of the flute, you will be fast asleep
 sun dikara, teri ba kii lori main bhi vah sammohan shakti nahin he, jo apane bacchon ko us gahari neend kaa sukh de sake
 Ba, i have started that effort
 roj nahaane ke baad main dhyaan mudra main baith jaataa hum, par vicitra he ba, dhyaan main tu aa jaati he, tere krishna nahin
 Is your Krishna not avoiding this place or half-hearted from me? My fellow companions scoff at the habit of bathing daily
 tali bajaakar talkh tippaniyan karte hai
 Kinnars do not worship others
 apni birdari ke kaayade–kanoon bhuulakar mari tu sant–mahatmaon jaisaa vyavhaar kyun kar rahi he?‘kyon kar rahaa he

 It is not my natural nature to clap
 strain lakshan mujhamen kabhi nahin rahe
 Still not and the symptoms that are not in me, just accept that all the rest of my community have adopted those gestures? Sit down with them and start razor-clearing the forest of arms and chest with their razor i have no option to live life without being a model? For the past five years, i have been looking for that end
 kuch saansen, adhuri-puri
 Whatever part you come in, i will cut a separate life from them, but why don't they come in my fists
 tumne skool ke liye nikalate samay, chupake se meri jeb main sarakaye jane vaale note kii bhaanti, ‘kha, lenaa, jo tere man main aaye, binni!’ dher–si dilasa sarkaayi thim mere jahan main
 Freed me that you are not a straw

 It is good for you to accept this, neither do you have any equal, nor do you have any discussion about your lack of it
 samaaj ko aise logon kii aadat nahin he or ve aadat daalana bhi nahin chaahate, par mujhe vishwaas he, hameshaa aisi sthiti nahin rahane vaali

 tu bataata he na ki tere bade skool main ankhon se andhe do bachche padhate hai! balki unke liye unki jarurat ke mutabik alag se skool hai
 Is a language read with fingers

 It is possible

 Your Pappa took you and showed me to the big specialist! 'how could your comfort be false? i continued to follow
 nakli taang si, main bhi us jaruri ang kii kami se ek din mukt ho jaaoongaa
 But soon my confusion broke
 tuune, meri ba, tuune or pappa ne milakar mujhe kasaayiyon ke haath maasoom bakrii sa saunp diya
 Why not take any legal action to protect me? Being a close friend of Superintendent of Police Pappa like Mansukh Bhai? They could not come to save me on their own

 Boys were afraid of me
 kehete the, jis khel kii pratiyogita main khadaa ho jaataa he tu vinod, prise lekar hi rahata he
 Leave some games to us! And even if i do not believe that i do not have the right to live, is it not my right to live life like normal people? The hell you and Pappa have pushed me, is a blind well, In which only snakes and scorpions live
 saanp–bichchhu banakar vah paidaa nahin hue honge
 Simply, this well did not let him remain a man
 jaanata hum ba! tere nasoor par nakhun gada rahaa hum, magar
 
 
 How is everyone at home? Good tell how is Pappa's health, 'blood pressure medicine is being given regularly to Pappa! When i was at home, i used to give them morning and evening
 ab manjul detaa hoga
 Manjul is definitely younger than me, but he is sensible
 vaise ba, jimmedaari padane par laaparvaah bachche bhi samajhadaar ho jate hai
 How happy i was when Mota Bhai had entrusted me with the responsibility that Pappa would have to feed you medicine in the morning and evening
 kuch dinon baad motaa bhai ne unka bladpressure naapnaa bhi sikhaa diya tha, lekin pappa mujh par vishwaas nahin karte the
 Despite writing my blood pressure, he would often plead to the fat brother, 'just come and take my blood pressure, Siddharth
 dekho, binni ne thik liya he ki nahin
 How much is the bottom? 'as soon as i left my house, you changed the house of Kalba Devi to Nala Sopara
 tum poochhogi, mujhe kaise maaloom
 Forcing my heart to listen to your voice for fear, when i called Kalba Devi one day, someone else picked up the phone there
 poochne par bataaya ki paanch varsh se yah ghar ab unka he
 They do not know where the old landlords live
 motaa bhai kaa naam lekar unhone itani soochna bhar di ki unke paas kingsve camp kaa unke daftar kaa phone nambar he
 He said that if any letter etc
 arrives at the forgotten address, they should inform them
 ve swayan aakar yaa kisi or ko bhejkar apni dak mangava lenge
 i had asked for the phone number of Mota Bhai's office
 motaa bhai ke daftar se naala sopaara vaale ghar kaa
 Why did you go home so far? Because of me! When Champabai came to her house for the first time, the neighbors asked you, "vandana Ben, why did these eunuchs come to your house?" The wrong news was to them, Sejal is from the stomach
 
 
 ’
 
 
 What a boast they had made for me inside the closed windows of the house
 unke paas pakki khabar he
 They want to see me, take them along
 saath le jane se unhen koi roak nahin saktaa
 There is no strength of the world
 khabar pakki nahin he to bachche ko saamne karo
 We will see for ourselves
 maafee maang nikal lenge ghar se
 In a trembling tone, you said to Pappa, 'let's forward Manjul
 ’rasoi se baahar aa tuune mujhe bathroom main band kar diya tha
 You came to the meeting by sticking Manjul with your legs
 manjul kii chaddhi utarava champa bai ne saaf kah diya tha
 They are playing games with them
 baccha isse bada he
 The reward is in this, surrender the real child to the family silently
 koi hangaamaa nahin machayenge ve
 Why are those people forced to forcefully prove the news as raw
 unki izzat kaa unhen bhi khyal he
 They themselves take care of their dignity? They will come again
 sangi–saathiyon ke saath aaenge
 They will gather their entire building under the house
 bathroom se baahar aate hi manjul ne sari baaten bayaan kii thim mujhase
 That night, no one had eaten at home except Sejal Bhabhi
 motaa bhai ne baithak ke bent vaale sofe par karavatein bharte puri raat kaat di thi
 Throughout the night, you had been filling me with your chest
 teri chaati main sir dubakaaye hue mujhe manjul ke janm ke samay teri kahi hui baat samaran ho aayi thi
 While keeping Manjul in my lap, i asked you, 'why don't i have my Nunnu?' So you made me feel like, 'you have to make dough of Nunnu after the child is born

 uttar pradesh main sattarudh samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav mangalvaar ko 77 saal ke ho gaye
 This month, his party has completed 25 years
 kuch vakt pehle mulaayam ke kunbe main machi kalah ab shant hoti dikh rahi he
 Mulayam, known as Netaji in the world of politics, has seen all the ups and downs in his political career
 22 november 1939 ko itawa jile ke saifai main janme mulaayam singh kii padhai-likhaai itawa, fatehabad or agra main hui
 Mulayam was also a professor at Jain Inter College, Karhal, Mainpuri, for a few days
 paanch bhai-bahanon main duusare number par mulaayam singh kii do shaadiyaan huin
 The first wife Malati Devi died in May 2003
 upi ke maujuuda siem akhilesh yadav mulaayam kii pehali patni ke bete hai
 Mulayam's second wife is Sadhana Gupta
 farvari 2007 main supreme court main mulaayam ne sadhana gupta se apane rishte kabool kiye to logon ko netaji kii duusari patni ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Mulayam's son Prateek Yadav is from Sadhana Gupta
 teacher se vidhayak bane pahalwaan mulaayampita sudhar singh mulaayam ko pahalwaan bananaa chaahate the lekin pahalwani main apane raajnneetik guru natthusingh ko mainpuri main yojit ek kushti-pratiyogita main prabhavit karne ke baad unhone natthusingh ke paramparaagat vidhaan sabha kshetra jaswantnagar se apana raajnneetik safar shuru kiya
 Mulayam became a legislator for the first time at the age of 28 under the umbrella of socialist ideology leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia and Raj Narayan
 jabaki unke parivaar kaa koi siyaasi becoground nahin tha
 In such a situation, 1967 was a historic year in Mulayam's political journey when he won the election for the first time and reached the assembly
 yah or baat he ki us vakt samaajawaadee party kaa namonishaan tak nahin tha
 Mulayam won the Jaswantnagar seat of his home district Etawah by defeating the RPI candidate on the ticket of the Sangat Socialist Party
 mulaayam ko pehali baar mantri banane ke liye 1977 tak intjaar karnaa padaa
 At that time, in the anti-congress wave, the Janata government was also formed in Uttar Pradesh
 50 saal kii umr main pehali baar bane siemmulaayam singh yadav 1980 ke aakhir main uttar pradesh main lok dal ke adhyaksh bane the jo baad main janata dal kaa hissaa ban gaya
 Mulayam became the CM of Uttar Pradesh for the first time in 1989
 november 1990 main centre main veepi singh kii sarkaar gir gai to mulaayam singh chandrashekhar kii janata dal (samaajawaadee) main shaamil ho gaye
 And with the support of Congress, he sat on the chair of CM
 april 1991 main congress ne samarthan waapas le liya to mulaayam singh kii sarkaar gir gai
 In 1991, there were mid-term elections in UP in which Mulayam Singh's party lost and BJP came to power in the state
 1992 main netaji ne banaai apni partychaar oktober, 1992 ko lakhanu ke begum hazrat mahal park main mulaayam singh yadav ne samaajawaadee party banane kii ghoshnaa kii
 Samajwadi Party's story continued along the political journey of Mulayam Singh
 mulaayam singh yadav ne jab apni party khadi kii to unke paas bada janaadhar nahin tha
 Assembly elections were to be held in UP in November 1993
 sapa mukhiya ne bijepi ko dobaaraa satta main aane se rokane ke liye bahujan samaaj party se gathjod kar liya
 This was the first major experiment of the Samajwadi Party
 babari masjid vidhwans ke baad paidaa hue siyaasi maahaul main mulaayam kaa yah prayog safal bhi rahaa
 Mulayam Singh again came to power with the support of Congress and Janata Dal and became CM
 jab piem banate-banate rah gaye the netajisamajawaadee party ko rashtriya str par pahchaan dilaane ke iraade se mulaayam ne centre kii raajnneeti kaa rukh kiya
 In 1996, Mulayam Singh Yadav was elected to the 11th Lok Sabha from Mainpuri seat
 us samay centre main sanyukt morcha kii sarkaar bani to usamen mulaayam bhi shaamil the
 Mulayam became the defense minister of the country
 haalanki, yah sarkaar bahut lambey samay tak chali nahin
 There was also talk of making Mulayam Singh Yadav the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri pad kii daud main ve sabase aage khadey the, lekin lalu prasad yadav or sharad yadav ne unke is iraade par pani pher diya
 After the elections, Mulayam Singh returned to the Lok Sabha from Sambhal
 asal main ve kannauj bhi jite the, lekin vahaan se unhone apane bete akhilesh yadav ko saansad banaaya
 In 2012, the son was brought to the top of power, the Samajwadi Party won the 2003 assembly elections
 29 agast 2003 ko mulaayam singh yadav ek baar phir uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane
 This government could live only for four years
 2007 main vidhansabha chunaav hue mulaayam singh satta se baahar ho gaye
 When the Samajwadi Party's condition worsened in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Mulayam Singh took a big decision
 rajya vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh kii kursi par chote bhai shivpal yadav ko bitha diya or khud dilli kii siyasat kii kaman sambhaal lee
 Before the 2012 elections, Netaji handed over the command of Uttar Pradesh SP to his son Akhilesh Yadav
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ke paksh main apratyaashit nattejey aae
 Netaji handed over the son of Akhilesh to the cm's chair and the second generation knocked in the Samajwadi Party
 mulaayam singh yadav kaa parivaar desh kaa sabase bada siyaasi parivaar he
 Today, 20 members of this family are part of the Samajwadi Party
 yah party usee lohiaji ke aadarshon par chalane kaa daawa karti he jo nehru kii parivaarwaad kii raajnneeti ko badhaava dene kii aalochana karte the
 There were some moments in Mulayam Singh's life from which he and his family were in controversies
 rampur tirahaa kandavo 1990 ke dashak ke shuruaati saal the jab uttarakhand kii maang jor pakad rahi thi
 On 2 October 1994, people were going to attend Delhi rally to demand separate Uttarakhand
 uttar pradesh main us vakt mulaayam singh yadav kii sarkaar thi
 It is said that on the orders of CM Mulayam, these people were surrounded on Rampur Tiraha near Muzaffarnagar
 is dauraan police ne andolankariyon par na sirf lathi-danda barasaaye balki firing bhi hui
 This incident is known as Rampur Tiraha firing incident
 is ghatana main 6 log maare gaye
 There were also allegations of molestation and rape of some women
 is ghatana ke baad puure pradesh main matam or afratfari kaa maahaul fail gaya
 After this incident, Mulayam Singh Yadav's image became like a villain
 dehradun samet tamaam jagahon par mulaayam singh ke khilaaf pradarshan ho rahe the
 Even after 22 years, the friends of this incident have not been punished
 court agar doshiyon ko bari bhi kar detii he to uttarakhand kii janata mulaayam singh ko shaayad hi maaf kare
 Guest house scandal The state guest house scandal in Lucknow on June 2, 1995 is the biggest stain on Mulayam Singh's political career
 us vakt bahujan samaaj party kii netaa mayawati se saath hue durvyavhaar kii vajah se mulaayam agle din hi satta se bedakhal ho gaye
 The incident also put a bigger discount on the credibility of the Samajwadi Party
 darasal, 1993 ke upi chunaav main basapa or sapa main gathbandhan hua tha, jisaki baad main jeet hui
 Mulayam Singh became the CM of UP
 lekin, aapasi khinchataan ke chalate 2 june, 1995 ko basapa ne sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi kii ghoshnaa kar di
 With this Mulayam Singh's government was reduced to a minority
 naaraaz sapa ke kaaryakartaaon ne lakhanu ke mirabai maarg sthit state guest house pahunch kar mayawati ko gher liya
 Here Mayawati stayed in room number-1
 unke saath basapa ke emele or kaaryakarta bhi maujuud the
 During this, SP workers beat him up and took him hostage
 mayawati ne apane aap ko bachaane ke liye kamare kaa darwaja andar se band kar liya tha
 After being held hostage for nearly 9 hours, BJP leader Lalji Tandon accompanied his supporters and rescued Mayawati from there
 isi ghatana ke baad se mayawati, lalji tandon ko apana bhai maanane lageen
 The matter of disproportionate assets went to the courts of Mulayam Singh Yadav and his family with disproportionate assets
 is maamle main supreme court main daayar yachika main kaha gaya ki 1977 main jab mulaayam singh yadav uttar pradesh main pehali baar mantri bane the, tab se lekar 2005 tak unki sampatti kareeb 100 guna zyada bad gai thi
 In such a situation, it should be investigated how he and his family acquired so much property
 shuru main is maamle main to mulaayam singh ke saath unke bete akhilesh yadav, bahu dimple yadav, duusare bete pratik yadav bhi aaropee the
 But the Supreme Court excluded Dimple Yadav from the scope of the investigation, saying that she was not in the public post at that time
 sheersh adaalat ne is maamle main sibiai jaanch kii maang vaali yachika bhi khaarij kar di he
 In the Yadav family, 'mahabharata' was fiercely fierce in Mulayam Singh's clan before the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki virdohi partiyon ne ise yadav parivaar kii sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat taiyaar kiya gaya 'drama' qaraar diya he
 The rumor of this infighting began only when Akhilesh protested against Mulayam's partner Amar Singh's return to the Samajwadi Party
 chachaa shivpal or amar singh ke samarthan se bahubali mukhtaar ansaari kii party ke samaajawaadee party main ho rahe vilay kaa akhilesh ne virodh kiya
 But Akhilesh did not do before Netaji
 baad main akhilesh yadav ne bhrashtachar ke aaropee kuch mantriyon ko apni cabinet se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Akhilesh also discharged uncle Shivpal Yadav, who holds key portfolios in his cabinet
 mulaayam singh ne balance karne kii koshish main pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad bete se chhinakar bhai ko saunp diya
 However, Shivpal returned to the cabinet later and this phase of infighting calmed
 lekin akhilesh ko pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad waapas nahin mil paaya
 Akhilesh then discharged some ministers, including uncle Shivpal, from his cabinet
 ab kalah kaa ek or daur yadav parivaar main shuru hua
 Mulayam's cousin and Rajya Sabha member Ram Gopal Yadav was expelled from the party
 akhilesh ke kuch or karibiyon kii bhi party se chuttee kar di gai
 But this time even after millions of efforts, uncle could not return to Shivpal's government but Ram Gopal has returned to the party
 is tarah siyaasi dangal ke maahir pahalwaan mulaayam ne chunaav se pehle kunbe ko ekajute kar liya he or kisi bhi samaaroh main puraa yadav parivaar saath dikhaai de rahaa he

 au (@cricketaus)january 18, 2015 Bihar School Education Board (BSEB) 12th results have been declared and with this the education system of Bihar Board has been exposed
 Bihar Board 12veen ke science stream main 70 fisadi bachche fail ho gaye hai

 Can see the result on in
 science stream kii khushboo kumari ne over ol top kiya he
 Khushboo Kumari 86
 2% ank hasil kiye hai, jo teenon stream main sabase zyada hai
 In the commerce stream, Priyanshu Jaiswal of Patna's College of Commerce has topped
 priyanshu ne 81
 Has scored 6 percentage points
 arts stream main 82
 Ganesh Kumar of Samastipur topped with 6%
 biesaibi ke 10veen or 12veen main top karne vaale chaatro ko diya jayega 1 lakh rupee kaa inaamhairaani kii baat yah he ki bihar board science stream se pariksha dene vaale sirf 30
 Only 11% students have passed
 vahiin arts main 37
 13% and the highest 73 in commerce
 76% chaatr paas hue hai
 Given the poor performance of the Bihar Board in the 12th results, the Principal Secretary of Education Department R
 ke mahajan ne kaha ki kadai se copy jaanch hone ke kaaran paas percentage ghat gaye hai
 The most interesting battle of politics and cricket is going on in the country at this time
 is ladaai kii sabase rochak baat he ki puure desh main log aakhir is jang ke jeetne vaale se zyada har din hone vaali jubaani jang, adalati sunwaayee main ruchi lete hai
 Everyone knows whether this fight has any effect on the politics of the country or not, but the difficulties of the central government have increased and it is bound to happen
 jab apane party ke saansad aarope laga rahe hon or khud kendriya vitt mantri ko court main jaakar manahani kaa mukadmaa karnaa pade to sarkaar kii chaabi par asar padana swaabhaavik he
 There has always been a figure of thirty-six between Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and bjp's now suspended Darbhanga MP Kirti Azad
 iske liye dilli kii cricket se zyada bihar kii raajnneeti jimmedaar rahi he
 It is not hidden from anyone in the cricket field that as Arun Jaitley's influence increased, in the same proportion, Kirti Azad went to the margins and the politics of Bihar was not only cricket but also the reason for Kirti Azad's displeasure
 haalanki kotla kii pich kaa amuman bihar kii raajnneeti ke maidan se koi lenaa-dena nahin hona chahie, lekin jetali or kirti ke bich jari jang main donon jagah samanaantar sah-maat kaa khel chalata rahaa
 Sometimes Jaitley won and sometimes Kirti did not let him run
 lekin ladaai aakhir thi kya, ise samajhnaa jaruri he
 In fact, Kirti Azad first became MP on BJP ticket from Darbhanga in Bihar in 1999
 unhone apane sansadeey kshetra darbhanga ke sthaneey bacchon ke liye ek cricket camp kaa aayojan kiya or uske samaapan main us samay rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ko le gaye
 This caused a lot of resentment among the BJP leaders
 baad ke dinon main jab ve saansad the tabhi rashtriya team ke chayankarta bhi bane lekin kisi kaaran se ek turm ke baad 2004 main na ve sansad rahe or na hi chayankarta
 Kirti believed that Jaitley used his influence to remove him from the selection committee
 iske baad 2005 main bihar main do baar vidhansabha chunaav hue or donon baar kirti ke ek bhi samarthak ko na to tikat mila or na hi unhen party ne prachaar laayak samajha gaya
 You can call it a coincidence that at that time, Arun Jaitley used to be BJP in-charge of Bihar elections
 ek samay naubat yahaan tak aa gai ki kirti ne apane aapako praasangik banaae rakhane ke liye motorcycle se prachaar kiya
 The party neither provided him any means nor asked him to go anywhere in the region
 baad ke dinon main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar bani or darbhanga kii raajnneeti main sanjay jha kaa pravesh hua
 Sanjay Jha once used to work in media for Rajiv Pratap Rudy
 baad ke dinon main jetali ke saath apane sambandhon ke kaaran sanjay jha nitish kumaar ke bhi najadik hue or yah mana jaataa he ki arun jetali, kirti aaazaad ke khilaaf unhen vikalp ke rup main taiyaar kar rahe the
 Nitish Kumar's silent consent was also in this
 lekin 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab tikat kaa bantwaaraa ho rahaa tha us samay sudhanshu mittal ko assam kaa sah prabharee banaae jane par arun jetali bihar kii list par charchaa hone ke thik pehle party se ruuthakar sansadeey board kii baithak se alag ho gaye
 Kirti directly benefited from this
 vah rajnath, sushamaa or adwani ke samarthan se tikat lene main safal ho gaye
 Then he also won the elections but his pain was always that the mps may be but Sanjay Jha, who is in the administration, has Arun Jaitley and Nitish Kumar on hand
 shaayad yahi kaaran rahaa ki jis tareeke se dilli cricket association kii baithak main aapane dekha hoga kirti jetali ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai usee tareeke se unhone ek baar samiksha baithak main nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bhi jamkar bolaa tha
 Nitish does not let Kirti get caught near him after that
 tippaniyan In 2014, Kirti was again elected as an MP in the Modi wave
 yah bhi sanyog rahaa ki janata dal united ke tikat par sanjay jha bhi unke khilaaf maidan main the lekin ve jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa paae
 But in the field of politics, Kirti may be beating Jaitley, but in Delhi cricket, his question was becoming less and more frequent
 iskaa malaal kirti ko hameshaa rahaa or is bich stadium nirmaan ke kagajaat unke haath lag gaye
 If Kirti opened a front against Jaitley, he had the support of many party leaders, directly or indirectly
 yah un netaaon kaa tabaka tha jo maanata tha ki unki vartmaan rajnatik sthiti ke liye jetali kahin na kahin jimmedaar hai
 Certainly this fight will intensify in the coming days, but it is clear that Kirti will have to go from Bihar with political baggage, because she has a figure of thirty-six with the leaders who run in Bihar BJP
 kirti jitna bolenge utani mushkilen ve bijepi or arun jetali ke liye badhaate rahenge jiskaa majaa lalu , nitish or congress ke netaa philhal uthaanaa chahenge

 kirti jitna bolenge utani mushkilen ve bijepi or arun jetali ke liye badhaate rahenge jiskaa majaa lalu , nitish or congress ke netaa philhal uthaanaa chahenge
 Although the pitch of Kotla should normally have nothing to do with the political arena of Bihar, the ongoing battle between Jaitley and Keerthi continued to play a parallel game
 kabhi jetali jite to kabhi kirti ne unki nahin chalane di
 But what was the fight like, it is important to understand it
 darasal kirti aaazaad pehali baar 1999 main bihar ke darbhanga se bijepi ke tikat par saansad bane
 He organized a cricket camp for the local children of his parliamentary constituency Darbhanga and took Lalu Yadav, then president of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, at the conclusion
 isse bijepi ke netaaon main badi naaraazgi rahi
 In later days, when he was an MP, he also became the selector of the national team, but for some reason after a period in 2004 he was neither a parliament nor a selector
 chayan samiti se hataae jane ke peeche kirti kaa maananaa tha ki jetali ne unhen apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar hataaya he
 Subsequently, in 2005, Bihar assembly elections were held twice and neither of the supporters of Kirti got a ticket nor was the party considered worth campaigning
 aap ise ek sanyog kah sakate hai ki us jamaane main arun jetali bihar chunaav ke bijepi prabharee hote the
 At one point, Kirti even campaigned with a motorcycle to keep herself relevant
 party ne unhen na to kabhi saadhan muhaiyaa karaayaa or na hi kshetra main kahin jane ke liye kaha
 Later, Nitish Kumar's government was formed and Sanjay Jha entered Darbhanga politics
 sanjay jha ek jamaane main rajeev pratap rudi ke liye media kaa kaam dekhte the
 In later days, Sanjay Jha was also close to Nitish Kumar due to his relationship with Jaitley and it is believed that Arun Jaitley was grooming him as an alternative against Kirti Azad
 isamen nitish kumaar kii maun sahmati bhi thi
 But Arun Jaitley parted ways with the parliamentary board meeting just before the list of Bihar was discussed when Sudhanshu Mittal was made co-incharge of Assam in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when the ticket was being distributed
 iskaa phayda sidhe kirti ko mila
 He managed to get tickets with the support of Rajnath, Sushma and Advani
 phir ve chunaav bhi jite lekin unka hameshaa dard yahi rahaa ki saansad bhale ve hon lekin prashasan main chalati sanjay jha kii he, jinke upar arun jetali or nitish kumaar kaa haath he
 Perhaps this is the reason that you must have seen in the Delhi Cricket Association meeting that you are targeting Kirti Jaitley, in the same way, he once lashed out against Nitish Kumar in a review meeting
 nitish ne uske baad kirti ko apane paas fatakane nahin diya
 The comments san 2014 main kirti phir modi lahar main saansad chune gaye
 It was also a coincidence that Sanjay Jha was also on the Janata Dal United ticket against him but he could not even save the bail
 lekin raajnneeti ke maidan main bhale kirti jetali ko maat dete ja rahe hon lekin dilli cricket main unki puch dinondin kam hoti ja rahi thi
 It was always up to Kirti and in the meantime he got the papers of the stadium construction
 jetali ke khilaaf agar kirti ne morcha kholaa to unhen pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se party ke kai netaaon kaa samarthan hasil tha
 It was a section of the leaders who believed that Jaitley was somewhere responsible for his current political situation
 nishchit rup se aane vaale dinon main yah ladaai or tej hogi, lekin kuch baaten spasht hai ki bihar se kirti ko raajnneetik boria-bistar samet janaa padegaa, kyonki bihar bijepi main jin netaaon kii chalati he unke saath unka chhattis kaa aankada rahaa hai
 As much as Kirti will speak, he will continue to increase the difficulties for BJP and Arun Jaitley, which Lalu, Nitish and Congress leaders would like to enjoy right now

 jetali ke khilaaf agar kirti ne morcha kholaa to unhen pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se party ke kai netaaon kaa samarthan hasil tha
 It was a section of the leaders who believed that Jaitley was somewhere responsible for his current political situation
 nishchit rup se aane vaale dinon main yah ladaai or tej hogi, lekin kuch baaten spasht hai ki bihar se kirti ko raajnneetik boria-bistar samet janaa padegaa, kyonki bihar bijepi main jin netaaon kii chalati he unke saath unka chhattis kaa aankada rahaa hai
 As much as Kirti will speak, he will continue to increase the difficulties for BJP and Arun Jaitley, which Lalu, Nitish and Congress leaders would like to enjoy right now
 baad ke dinon main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar bani or darbhanga kii raajnneeti main sanjay jha kaa pravesh hua
 Sanjay Jha once used to work in media for Rajiv Pratap Rudy
 baad ke dinon main jetali ke saath apane sambandhon ke kaaran sanjay jha nitish kumaar ke bhi najadik hue or yah mana jaataa he ki arun jetali, kirti aaazaad ke khilaaf unhen vikalp ke rup main taiyaar kar rahe the
 Nitish Kumar's silent consent was also in this
 lekin 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab tikat kaa bantwaaraa ho rahaa tha us samay sudhanshu mittal ko assam kaa sah prabharee banaae jane par arun jetali bihar kii list par charchaa hone ke thik pehle party se ruuthakar sansadeey board kii baithak se alag ho gaye
 Kirti directly benefited from this
 vah rajnath, sushamaa or adwani ke samarthan se tikat lene main safal ho gaye
 Then he also won the elections but his pain was always that the mps may be but Sanjay Jha, who is in the administration, has Arun Jaitley and Nitish Kumar on hand
 shaayad yahi kaaran rahaa ki jis tareeke se dilli cricket association kii baithak main aapane dekha hoga kirti jetali ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai usee tareeke se unhone ek baar samiksha baithak main nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bhi jamkar bolaa tha
 Nitish does not let Kirti get caught near him after that
 tippaniyan In 2014, Kirti was again elected as an MP in the Modi wave
 yah bhi sanyog rahaa ki janata dal united ke tikat par sanjay jha bhi unke khilaaf maidan main the lekin ve jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa paae
 But in the field of politics, Kirti may be beating Jaitley, but in Delhi cricket, his question was becoming less and more frequent
 iskaa malaal kirti ko hameshaa rahaa or is bich stadium nirmaan ke kagajaat unke haath lag gaye
 If Kirti opened a front against Jaitley, he had the support of many party leaders, directly or indirectly
 yah un netaaon kaa tabaka tha jo maanata tha ki unki vartmaan rajnatik sthiti ke liye jetali kahin na kahin jimmedaar hai
 Certainly this fight will intensify in the coming days, but it is clear that Kirti will have to go from Bihar with political baggage, because she has a figure of thirty-six with the leaders who run in Bihar BJP
 kirti jitna bolenge utani mushkilen ve bijepi or arun jetali ke liye badhaate rahenge jiskaa majaa lalu , nitish or congress ke netaa philhal uthaanaa chahenge

 ) a formal request has been made to the Government of Antigua on behalf of the extradition of Mehul Choksi, an accused in the Punjab National Bank scam and fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi
 vahiin antigua prashasan kaa chaunkaane vaala daawa he ki chokasee ko antigua kii naagarikta bharat kii taraf se mili bedaag report ke aadhaar par di gai
 According to a senior Mumbai Police official, the Malabar Hills Police Station has given a clean chit (immaculate report) regarding Choksi
 bataa den ki 13,000 karod ke pienbi ghotaale main sibiai dwaara mehul chokasee or neerav modi par maamla darj hone se kuch din pehle hi chokasee bharat chhod kar dubai chalaa gaya tha
 Choksi applied for police verification at the Regional Passport Office on 23 February 2017
 jiske babat 15 dinon ke bheetar hi 10 march 2017 ko malabar hills police stesan kii taraf se bedaag report de di gai
 It is believed that on the basis of this report, Mehul Choksi acquired citizenship of Antigua
 yah chaunkaane vaali baat he ki mehul chokasee jiske upar 2017 main kai maamle darj the, use bedaag report kis aadhaar par di gai or mumbai police ne report dene se pehle in maamalon ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 However, the existing system also has the same flaw
 police ke mutabik chokasee ko bedaag report isliye di gai kyonki uske khilaaf koi aapraadhik prishthbhumi yaa giraftaar ke pramaan nahin mili the
 Explain that such clearance is given by the Mumbai Police's Online Criminal Background and Information System (CAIS)
 yadi koi vyakti purv main giraftaar hua he to vah sieaies main aa jaataa he
 On March 14, the Mumbai Police's Special Branch submitted the report to the Regional Passport Office, Mumbai
 antigua kaa daawa he ki chokasee ne may 2017 main naagarikta ke liye aavedan kiya or yah naagarikta bharat ke videsh mantralay ke adheen kshetreey passport karyaalay se mili bedaag report ke aadhaar par di gai
 However, Mumbai Police has ordered a probe into the issue of police verification report to Choksi
 lekin yah spasht nahin ho sakaa he ki mehul chokasee ko clearence kisi ke prabhaav main di gai yaa phir yah puraani vyavastha main khami kii vajah se mili
 a release issued by the Mumbai Police said that the Regional Passport Office granted Choksi the status of 'not required police verification' in 2015 and after this Choksi, now the main accused in the PNB scam, had obtained a passport in the immediate category

 Delhi assembly election is near and all parties are looking for ways to woo voters, but this time, the role of Facebook users can also be important in whose government will be formed in Delhi
 aankadon ke mutabik dilli kii zyaadaatar vidhansabha siton main fasebuk yugers itani badi taadaad main hai ki kisi bhi ummidavaar kii haar or jeet kaa faisla kar sakate hai
 There are about 10 million voters in Delhi
 saal 2008 ke chunaavon main 58 fisadi yani kareeb 61 lakh logon ne vot ke adhikaar kaa istemaal kiya
 Congress won the election and the party got around 25 lakh votes but you will be surprised to know how many people are using Facebook in Delhi
 dilli ke fasebuk yugers kii taadaad pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet hasil karne vaali congress party ko mili kul voton se bhi zyada he
 There are around 43 lakh Facebook users in Delhi and the number of Facebook users above 18 years is around 38 lakhs, which means that more people are using Facebook than the number of votes needed to reach Delhi's power
 is aankde ko agar vidhansabha siton main baant liya jaae to har vidhansabha kshetra main kareeb 54 hazaar fasebuk yugers maujuud hai
 In the last assembly election, there were only two seats where the winning candidate got more than 54 thousand votes
 yani dilli kii 68 vidhansabha siton par jeet ke liye jitne vot chaiye usase zyada fasebuk yugers maujuud hai

 is baat ko dilli ke rajaneta bhi khub samaj rahe hai

 vijay goyal ke kareeb 3000 fasebuk folors hai
 Former BJP state president Vijender Gupta has around 3200 followers on Facebook
 congress ke dabang vidhayak mukesh sharma fasebuk par bhi kareeb 5 hazaar logon ke chahete hai
 Young Congress MLA Chaudhary Anil Kumar is also using Facebook to connect with people
 unke fasebuk doston kii list main bhi kareeb 5 hazaar naam darj hai
 The new party of Delhi is understanding this new fund of Facebook and Aam Aadmi Party convenor is in the forefront of Facebook followers
 kejariwal ke kareeb 8500 folors hai or kareeb 28 xxrep 4 0 pej like hai
 Manish Sisodia, the other leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, also has about 5000 Facebook friends
 yani har party ke netaa votaron se sampark banane ke liye fasebuk kaa istemaal kar rahe hai lekin sawaal yahi he ki kya vaaki fasebuk folors voton main tabdeel ho paaenge

 bhaajapa netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi jahaan mahilaon ko kos rahe hai vahi kerala ke mukhyamantri ve es achyutanandan ne shahid major sandip sandip unnikrishnan ke pita ke bare main kaha he ki agar sandip shahid nahin hua hota to unke ghar kutta bhi jhaankne nahin jaataa
 This statement of the Chief Minister is being condemned all over the country but the Chief Minister has refused to apologize for his statement
 apane mata-pita kii iklauti santan major sandip unnikrishnan pichley saptaah mumbai main hue aatankwaadi hamalon main aatankwaadiyon se ladate hue shahid ho gaye the
 His father Shri K
 unnikrishnan bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan ( isro) ke sevanivrutt adhikari hai
 On Monday, the Chief Minister of Kerala, Mr
 Achuthanandan had gone to the home of Mr
 Unnikrishnan with his lashkar-lashkar but the father of the martyr Major refused to meet him
 lekin, unke inkaar ke baavjood jab mukhyamantri apane suraksha adhikariyon or anya logon kii bheed lekar unke ghar ke andar ja pahunche to krodhit unnikrushanan ne un sabhi logon ko ghar se nikaal diya tha
 Stung by this insult, the Chief Minister of Kerala said in front of journalists that if Major Sandeep had not been martyred, he would not have even seen a dog in his house
 pichley kai dinon se begum karina kapur khan kii tulana bollywood kii nai star aalia bhatta se kii ja rahi he
 This comparison is seen against Kareena against her pride
 unka maananaa he ki aalia or unamem koi samanta nahin he
 This is just a media game
 karina ke mutabik agar unki tulana kerani hi he to unki saas sharmila tagore, hema malini or unki bahan karishma se kii jaae
 He said, 'they are all industry giants
 agar meri tulana inase kii jaaegi to mujhe bilkul bura nahin lagegaa kyonki ye sabhi behad aakarshak, pyaari or stylish hai'
 According to Kareena, it is irresponsible to keep Alia on par with him
 haal hi main ek intervyuu main karina ne kaha, 'mere liye ye sammaan kii baat he ki aalia apane intervyuu main mujhe izzat detii hai or mere bare main acchhee baaten bolti hai
 She is a lovely girl
 isamen koi buraai nahin ki vah meri fain hai
 i love it '
 darasal, kai logon ko aalia bhatta nai karina kapur lagati hai
 Some even say that Alia onscreen is exactly like the worship of the film 'kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham'
 film main puja kaa kirdaar karina ne hi nibhaayaa tha
 However, many film personalities like Karan Johar did not see any similarities between these two girls
 filmmekar karan johar ke liye to bas bollywood main ek hi karina he

 Baba has become blind
 kya bhakton se ruth gaye hai baba barphani? aisa isliye kaha ja rahaa he kyonki amarnath yatra puri hone se pehle hi baba barphani antardhyaan ho gaye hai
 The Shivling, which used to be several feet in size in the sacred cave, has now completely melted
 ab amarnath yatra par jane vaale bhakton ko keval pavitra gupha ke hi darshan honge, prakritik rup se banane vaale shivlinga ke nahin
 The Amarnath Yatra started with great enthusiasm with har-har Mahadev's Jayghosh
 lekin yatra shuru hone ke 18 din baad baba barphani antardhyaan hone lage
 The 14-feet Shivling melted and became mysteriously smaller
 ham aapako bataa den ki ye tasviren 13 july kii hai
 Whereas on 14 July Baba Barfani's size was just a few inches
 manyataon ke mutabik amarnath main saakshaat shiv or parvati kaa vaas he, kehete hai ki shiv or shakti kii maujuudagi se hi har saal yahaan apane aap barf kii murat main lakhon bhakton ko darshan dene ke liye mahadev prakat hote hai
 This holy idol of snow is called Shivalinga
 abhi tak bhakton ko 55 dinon tak darshan dekar mahadev antardhyaan ho jate the, lekin ab kedarnath kii tarah hi amarnath ne bhi bhakton se munh mode liya he
 However, this time Baba Barfani is angry with his devotees even before the journey starts
 14 may ko baba barphani kaa aakaar 16 feet tha
 In a month, it has reduced to 9 feet and now it is just a few inches
 baba barphani kaa antardhyaan hone se un shraddhaluon ko maayusi hogi jo abhi yatra ke liye aane vaale hai
 Baba Barfani's journey started with full fervor and enthusiasm on 28 June
 lakhon bhakt baba barphani ke darshan ke liye nikle
 But Mahadev left Amarnath cave within two weeks
 jabaki amarnath yatra abhi 21 agast tak jari rahegi, aise main bhakt hairaan hai ki ab wo pavitra gupha main ruthe nath ko kaise manaaege
 The journey of Amarnath started from June 28, so far, nearly two and a half lakh devotees have visited Barfani Baba
 jabaki saadhe teen lakh bhakt amarnath pahunch sakate hai, har din hajaaron shraddhalu pavitra gupha main baba barphani ke darshan kar rahe he, lekin pehali baar bhakt pavitra gupha main mahadev kii naaraazgi ko mahasoos kar rahe hai, darshan karke laute bhakt bataate he ki mahadev kaa antardhyaan hona unki krodhlila he
 If someone has come to Amarnath for the first time, someone has come many times, the devotees are very sad due to the news of Baba Barfani being intercepted, now they will not be able to see that Shiva Linga in Amarnath cave for which they are so difficult Traveling and reach Amarnath Yatra Once upon a time, the desire of every Shiva devotee is in the mind, because the form of Mahadev sitting in the holy cave of Amarnath is nothing short of a miracle
 
 barphani baba kaa ye rup na keval apane aap prakruti banaati he, balki is dauraan isamen saakshaat mahadev aakar vaas karte hai
 It is said that water drops dripping above the Shivling present in the cave
 usee jal ke jamane se ye shivlinga banataa he, mana jaataa he ki ye jal ramkund se tapakataa he, jo gupha ke bilkul upar he
 According to the belief, on the full moon night, the Shivalinga is in its full size and after the full moon as the size of the moon decreases, the size of the Shivalinga also decreases
 lekin amarnath main bhole bhandari aise ruthe ki pahaado par pad rahi garmi se mahadev pehle hi antardhyaan ho gayi
 The Meteorological Department also believes that there is a sudden increased heat behind the melting of the Shivling
 dharm se jude log maanate hai ki mausam kaa achaanak garm hona mahadev kaa krodh hi he
 At the start of the yatra, the rain stopped the devotees and now Mahadev himself left the holy cave, which means that Nath's displeasure has not gone away
 aakhir kyon amarnath kii pavitra gupha se antardhyaan ho gayi bhole bhandari
 Why Shivling melted in about two weeks
 dharm main aasthaa rakhane waalon ke liye ye ek bada sawaal he
 But according to scientists, this year Amarnath got more heat than previous years, due to which the Shivling of snow melted
 aasthaa kii amarnath gupha ke jate hue raste sookhe or sapaat pade hai
 Usually, the paths on which snow is visible at this time, there is no sign of snow
 amarnath gupha main pipe se pani nikal rahaa he
 There is no question of water flowing in the Amarnath cave at this time because snow is snow at this time
 is saal ghati main taapmaana 37 degree tak pahunchaa he
 Due to the huge crowd, the temperature around the Amarnath cave increased further
 haalanki shrin board ne daawa kiya tha ki pichley do-teen saal main unhone kuch aise upaay kiye hai jisase gupha taapmaana naa bade
 In 2013, Baba Barfani was reduced from 16 feet to 9, before the size of Shivalinga was reduced from 22 feet to 14 feet in 2012
 saal 2011 main 16 feet ke baba barphani ke darshan die the jo mahaj 5 dinon main 4 feet tak pigal gaye
 And in the year 2010, the size of the Shivling of 12 feet melted first to 6 feet and later to 3 feet and by the end of a month's journey Baba Barfani was completely inundated
 har tirth sthaan par bhakton main maayusikya kedarnath, kya kailash maansarovar or kya amarnath, mahadev aise ruthe hai ki har tirth sthaan par bhakton ko maayusi hi haath lag rahi he
 First Mahadev left Kedar from the deluge, then due to bad weather, the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra had to be stopped and now Mahadev disappeared in the holy cave of Amarnath
 dharm se jude jaankaar maanate hai ki devbhumi par aae jalpralay ke baad se hi nath kupit hai
 Nath destroyed Uttarakhand with his third eye open, the journey to Char Dham is halted, but now Lord Shiva's intervention in Amarnath is clear that Nath's displeasure is not far away
 lekin kedaar main ai jalpralay bhi bhakton kii aasthaa ko nahin diga saki
 Devotees felt that Bhole Bhandari would be celebrated in Amarnath
 tamaam dikkaton ke baavjood bhakthi kaa sailaab amarnath main umad padaa

 Election campaigns in several states have once again brought to the fore the relationship of privilege of power and personal security in our country
 mujhe bataaya gaya he ki rashtriya rajdhani ke kareeb hone ke chalate uttar pradesh main suraksha tamzam ke saath utar rahe tamaam netaa apane angrakshakon ke chalate ba'bal kaa adhiktam asar paidaa kar rahe hai
 The safety of the state leaders has its place in it
 11 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todebharat main nijee suraksha ke vikaas ke sutara talashna dilachasp hoga
 There was a time when no one, including the Prime Minister, had such an elaborate security arrangement
 mujhe '80 ke dashak kii shuruyaat kii ek ghatana acchhee tarah yaad he
 My mother-in-law came to us in Delhi
 maine unhen shahar ghumaane ke liye ek din kii chuttee lee thi
 i reached South Block by driving a car and parked the car at the entrance of the Prime Minister's Office and went inside to handle any urgent work
 meri patni or saas car main hi baithi hui thim
 When i returned, my mother-in-law was impatient - Prime Minister Indira Gandhi passed by the side of our car on her way home for lunch
 04 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todeaj pradhanmantri karyaalay ke pravesh dwaar ke paas kahin bhi car khadi karne kii kalpana lagbhag asambhav he
 As we all know, the assassination of Indira Gandhi changed India's security scenario forever
 saat saal baad ek chunaav abhiyaan main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii hatya kai myanon main aajkal chunaav ke dauraan pratyaashiyon or prachaarkon kii suraksha vyavastha ke ati-rakshaatmak hone ke liye jimmedaar he
 December 28, 2011: See India Today in pictures
 Long before that, the eligibility for security had become a status symbol not only among the leaders but also among the officers

 aisi ummid kii gai thi ki is vargeekaran kaa paalan kiye jane se ahankaar or rutabe par aadhaarit ucchtar suraksha ke liye maang kam-se-kam hogi
 However, the class seeking security could not be trapped in this maneuver for more days
 ek baar 'raaj' ujagar ho jane ke baad har kisi ne ucchtam, 'jed' nahin balki 'jed plus' shrenee kii suraksha vyavastha kii fariyaad shuru kar di

 The safari suit then became the identity of the personal security officer
 phir har mukhyamantri ne apni suraksha main aisa hi tamzam shuru kar diya
 Unfortunately, many people also believe that if a policeman wears a safari suit, he automatically becomes a competent personal security officer
 14 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todachunaav ayog ne chizon ko vyavasthit karne ke liye bahut mehnat kii he
 The guidelines regarding the use of security squad vehicles are very clear
 chunaav ke dauraan mantri yaa kisi bhi rajnatik padaadhikari ko payalat car istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin hoti, bhale hi rajya prashasan ne use sashastr angrakshakon kii maujuudagi vaala suraksha cover pradaan kar rakhaa ho
 Officers of various services are mobilized from remote states to oversee elections so that there is no bias
 isi tarah doordaraj ke jin rajyon main chunaav ho rahe hai, vahaan chaukiyon ko majboot karne or kanoon-vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye police bal ko bharat ke ek sire se duusare tak bheja jaataa he
 At present, eight companies of Kerala Armed Police Force are deployed in Punjab elections
 07 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today When Munawad Salman, a 30-year-old engineer working in Google's Hyderabad office, was arrested from the city's airport in October last year, police claimed he was going to Saudi Arabia
 vahaan se uski yojana iraq jaakar jihadi aatanki samooh islamic state of iran and syria (iageies) main shaamil hone kii thi
 Salman was later released
 usne iageies kii prachaar saamagree ko kathith taur par kai maheenon tak internet par padhaa tha or uske baad vahaan jane kaa kaa man banaaya
 This is where the story takes a new turn
 is kism ke kai online chat or samvaad satr darasal guptchar karmiyon ke saath ho rahe the jo salmaan jaise yuvaaon ko chaan maarane ke liye net par apana jaal bichhaae hue hai
 In search of them, there were young people who are being initiated online to bring them into terrorist groups
 bhartiya guptchar agenciyon kaa yah taaja counter intelligence program he jise naam diya gaya he ‘oparation chakravyuuh’
 Right now this idea is in the development stage but it is a strategy whose time has come
 oparation chakravyuuh ke bare main ek counter intelligence agency ke ek sadsy ne india today ko bataaya, “afasar jihadi samoohon kii pahchaan ke saath apane khate kholte hai or fasebuk, yahuu yaa anya chat manchon par aise yuvaaon ko lubhaane kii koshish karte hai jo online aatanki prachaar saamagree se prabhavit hon
 After the initial conversation, those who find out that they are interested in doing jihad are taken to a separate chat room or asked to establish Raabta via email
 ”us guptchar adhikari ne bataaya ki salmaan unki chapet main tab aayaa jab agenciyon ne iageies ke mukhiya abu bakr al bagdadi kii tasviir lagaakar ek chat room shuru kii or is jihadi samooh se sambhddha hone kaa daawa kiya, jiskaa kaam icchhuk abhyarthiyon kii bhartee karnaa he
 Once such people are clearly identified, then the work of finding out their real identity, details, etc
, remains to be seen
 salmaan ko aise hi pakadaa gaya tha
 In the same manner, in the last six months, about 120 youth have been identified who were willing to go to ISIS
 philhal karrwai karne main khud ko aksham paane ke kaaran agenciyon ne abhi sirf un par apni nigaraanee banaae rakhi he
 The misuse of Twitter by ISIS supporters like Bangalore engineer Mehdi Masroor Biswas, arrested in December last year, has opened up a box called 'online terror training' to many
 lekin grih mantralay ne aise maamalon par abhi sanyam baratate hue isse duusare tareeke se nibatane kaa faisla kiya he
 The Ministry's Internal Security Department has been asked to prepare a national program as part of the next phase of Operation Chakravyuh, conducted by terrorist groups to monitor and identify youth training online
 uskaa praathmik jor internet par maujuud jihadi prachaar saamagree se nibatna hoga
 The idea was presented in detail in Guwahati at the annual conference of Directors General of Police in November last year
 vahaan intelligence beuro ne counter-radicalijeshan or di-radicalijeshan program kii jarurat par vistaar se apni baat rakhi
 The Chief of Police agreed that greater capacity needs to be developed to monitor cyberspace
 or iske liye ek ulat prachaar saamagree taiyaar karke use internet par prachaarit kiya janaa chahie taaki yuvaaon ko aatankiyon ke changul main funsane se roka ja sake
 Such efforts have been made earlier also
 online jihad par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye ek prayaas to isliye naakaam ho gaya tha kyonki yah neshnal technical research orgenigeshan (antiaro), ibi or research and analysis wing (ro) ke bich naukarshahi ke jaal main funs gaya tha
 These three agencies are under the National Security Advisor
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki isiilie ab jo yojana banaai ja rahi he uske tahat jelon ke bheetar aise centre banaae jaaenge jahaan visheshgy dikshit kattarpathiyon kaa manovaigyanik vishleshan or moolyankan karenge
 a problem with intelligence agencies is that the dividing line between taking risks and promoting a jihadi is very thin
 indian mujahidin ke pehle modeul ko ujagar karne vaale dilli police ke special cell ke purv mukhiya karanal singh kehete hai, “ham nahin jaanate ki sanlipt log kis had tak ja chuke hai yaa jane ke icchhuk hai
 Therefore such initiatives (counter and de-radicalization) may become a tool for investigators in the future
 ”is ranneeti kii aalochanaayen bhi maujuud hai
 Even senior IB officials, as well as many within intelligence agencies, believe that such programs may make minorities feel more isolated
 iske alaava, aalochakon kaa kahana he ki koi bhi phulpruf counter-radicalijeshan program nahin hota
 They cite Man Horin Monis, a self-proclaimed publicist, accused in Australia's Sydney hostage scandal in December
 vah australia main is kism kii ek anti-radicalijeshan pahal kaa hissaa bhi rahaa tha
 Apparently, the program failed to flush out the radical elements within it
 iske baavjood ek tathy se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki kattar vichaar, siddhant or upadesh online badi aasaani se uplabdh hai
 Special Commissioner of Delhi Police Special cell

 Sreevastava says, "social media has given him a great opportunity to express and publicize his staunch views
 ”takanic ke jaankaar jihadi achche se jaanate hai ki apane paksh main internet kaa adhiktam istemaal kis tarah kiya ja saktaa he
 One of them is the use of proxy servers
 ibi ke purv vishesh nideshak rajendra kumaar bataate hai, “aap ek twitor khaataa band kar dijie, ve doosraa khol lenge
 "except for the knowledge of technology, even after exposing a terrorist module, our intelligence agencies often remain empty handed
 is kshetra main hue kam shodh or saamagree ke abhaav main unke paas kul milakar sandigdhon kii counselling karne ke liye manovishleshak hi bachate hai
 For example, he does not have a cut of Ajan, a magazine promoting Al Qaeda
 neshnal investigeshan agency (enie) ke ek adhikari kehete hai, “lekin ye log kattarta main jabardast dhang se daksh hote hai
 When Yasin Bhatkal of IM was caught, we tried his counseling but we were unsuccessful
 ”jihadi prachaar kii mukhaalafat karne ke liye dilli se ek website chalaane vaale sultan shaheen bataate hai ki unki site ko pakistan main pratibandhit kar diya gaya he
 However, in some other countries, where such programs are being conducted, lessons need to be taken from there
 ve kehete hai, “di-radicalijeshan program bhale bahut kaamyaab na ho, lekin bharat ke pariprekshya main counter-radicalijeshan madadgaar ho saktaa he
 "NIA chief Sharad Kumar says," Such youth are easily caught on the Internet
 ek baar ye kattar ban gaye to phir kahin bhi khatra paidaa kar sakate hai-bharat main, chaahe baahar
 We have to attack their root
