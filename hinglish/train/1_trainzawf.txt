 The case of Uttar Pradesh has slipped towards anarchy, it is not only revealed by the incident of gang rape and murder of two backward caste girls in Katra village of Badaun district on May 27, but also about this horrific incident political and It is also evident from the statements of the administrative staff
 do kishoravay chacheri bahanon kii kaaya apane ghar se kuch duuri par ped par nau ghante tak lataki rahi kyonki sthaneey police vaale exiar darj karne main naa-nukar kar rahe the

 To save this Gundaraj at all costs, the statements of 40-year-old Akhilesh Yadav were so moved by the statements of his father and uncles that he told a female reporter on May 31, "are you safe or not?" The woman reporter questioned her about the ever increasing crimes against women in the state

 Says a top police officer, "the ideal rule of law and order is that more important is the general perception than statistics and on this front the Akhilesh government has failed miserably
 ’’darasal samasya teen mukhya vajahon se paidaa ho rahi he
 One, just a week after coming to power in March 2012, Akhilesh changed the decision that prevented policemen from posting in the entire Uttar Pradesh in their home district and neighboring district and thus did not allow the police to dominate the castes Was
 masalan, dakshin-pashchim main itawa or mainpuri ke aasapaas yadavon yaa mujffarnagar or meerut ke aasapaas pashchimi uttar pradesh main jaaton kii tainaati na hone paae

" vahaan ve kisi ke chachaa, kisi ke bhai ho sakate hai yaa kisi se unka vair ho saktaa he isliye vah purvaagrah se dur puliciye kii bhoomika adaa nahin kar saktaa
 This change added a new chapter to the already corrupt police system
 ’’(ye hai upi ke saadhe paanch mukhyamantri- mulaayam singh yadav, ramgopal yadav, anita singh, ajam khan, shivpal singh yadav- upar se neeche kii ore, or aadhe mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav)jatigat jodbandiakhilesh ke rajkaaj ke tareekon se rajya main police vyavastha hui taar-taaqapane grih jilon main tainaat pulisavaalon kii pakshpatpurna bhoomika haal main badaayun kii balaatkaar kii vaardaat ke dauraan hi nahin dikhi, balki kathith taur par 2013 ke mujffarnagar dangon main bhi dikhi thi, jahaan aakhirkaar fouj bulani padi

 Secondly, the SHO or inspector-in-charge of 1,560 police stations of the state is elected by a board which has been looking into matters like arrest records, criminal cases against officers, corruption etc

 This imbalance of power leads to such incidents which were cited by a Director General - In a police station in Allahabad division, the police caught a man with a country-made pistol and locked it in the police station
 uske baad ek sthaneey sapa netaa thane main aayaa, lowep kii chaabiyaan maangin, khud hi taala kholaa or us shaks ko jabt desi pistaul ke saath lekar chupchaap baahar nikal gaya

 "and thirdly, the two most effective branches of the Uttar Pradesh Police - the Special Task Force (STF) and the anti-terrorist Squad (ATS) - to tackle organized crime and terror, have been left untouched in the new system

 He has suddenly started showing complete agility but it is also true that the Yadav fraternity in the state has been given the impetus to run due to the inaction caused by the clutches of his family members
 adhikariyon ke chayan menkamkaaj ke badale vafadari ko tarjeeh dene se bhi akhilesh raaj kaa asar khatm hua he
 In the new bureaucratic reshuffle in early June, Akhilesh brought in more active Alok Ranjan in place of Chief Secretary Javed Usmani

 In fact, many decisions in the SP are taken only with the consent of the special group of members of the Yadav clan
 is chote-se daayre main kabhi-kabhi ekmaatr bahari vyakti party ke muslim chehre ajam khan hi bulaae jate hai
 Though Akhilesh is much closer to his uncle Ram Gopal and does not get along with his uncle Shivpal, he does not have the courage to defer to either of them, keeping in mind the family tradition
 apane chaachaaon kii ichchhaaon ko to har haal main unhen puraa k rana hi he
 At times, Mulayam also comes in the middle and runs his veto, from serious matters like political relations with other parties to small appointments
 yahi vajah he ki mukhyamantri ko apane kai saare faislon se you-turn lenaa padaa he
 This included decisions such as not giving electricity to the mall after seven o'clock in the evening after the formation of the SP government and allowing legislators to buy expensive cars from their funds

 Even after the Lok Sabha elections, when Akhilesh Yadav snatched the red lights of the 36-ranked ministers, Mulayam Singh Yadav was once again active and sidelined his son's wish and overturned his decision and restored some of the leaders

 Says sociologist Dipankar Gupta at Shiv Nadar University, "there is no doubt that Akhilesh Yadav has disappointed

 supreme court ne bisisiai ke nirvasit adhyakshain shrinivasanapar chunaav ladane se roak laga diya he, vahiin ab bhavishya kii ranneeti tay karne ke liye shrinivasana ne guuruuvaar ko chennai main kuch manyata praapt ikaayiyon kii anaupchaarik baithak bulaai he
 a BCCI member going to Chennai to attend the meeting said, "srinivasan has called a meeting in Chennai on February 5
 ise kareebi sanghon kii kor samiti kii baithak kaha ja saktaa he
 The AGM date and future strategy will certainly be considered on that day
 hamen shrini kii bhavishya kii ranneetiyon kii spasht tasviir bhi pataa chal jaaegi
 '
 bataaya jaataa he ki sachiv sanjay patel, antarim adhyaksh shivlal yadav jaise kai mahatvapurn padaadhikari is baithak main upasthit rahenge
 However, Joint Secretary Anurag Thakur could not attend the meeting due to lack of information
 himachal pradesh cricket sangh ke adhyaksh or bijepi saansad ke behad kareebi sutara ne kaha, ‘thakur saat farvari ko hone vaale chunaav ke kaaran dilli main vyast rahenge
 But it is surprising that Srinivasan did not inform him of the meeting
 unhen bisisiai ke sheersh padaadhikariyon ke jariye hi baithak kaa pataa chalaa
 '

 andhra pradesh ke bhavi mukhyamantri wies jagan mohan reddy ne ravivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi se dilli pahunchakar mulaakaat kii
 During this meeting, Jagan congratulated PM Modi for the victory
 vahiin pradhanmantri modi ne bhi unka gale lagaakar swaagat kiya
 During this both of them saw quite a lot of warmth
 iske baad wiesar congress ke endie (neshnal democratic elliance) main shaamil hone kii atakalein or tej ho gayi
 TDP (telugu Desam Party) chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, who was a partner of NDA till some time ago, left no stone unturned to unite opposition leaders, opposing Modi before the election
 iske liye unhone kai vipakshi netaaon se mulaakaat kar ek manch par aane kii kavayad kii
 However, all his hard work and exercise was lost when the opposition and the coalition faced a severe shakeup in the election results and the BJP got a thumping majority
 vahiin, andhra pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 46 saal ke jagan mohan reddy kii party wiesar congress ne 175 main se 151 siton par kabja kar chandrababu naidu kii party ko karaari shikast dene main kamyaabi pai
 The TDP has got just 23 seats in this election
 saath hi wiesar congress ne loksabhaa chunaav main bhi 25 main se 22 seat jitkar behatar pradarshan kiya, jabaki tidipi 3 siton par hi simat gai
 With this, the way for the rise of a new representation in the state has been cleared
 ye bhi padhein-pita kii viraasat ke liye congress se lee takkar, ab CM banenge jagan mohan reddiandhra pradesh main 23 may ko aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon se pehle agsit pole main wiesar congress ko tidipi se zyada siten milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya tha
 In such a situation, the Congress tried to bring Jagan with him
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne upie kii ore se jagan mohan se phone par baat karne kii koshish kii, lekin jagan ne pavaar se baat nahin kii
 Which made it clear that Jagan was not going to open his cards for the Congress
 final nateezon ne reddy ko or takat de di he
 On one hand, Jagan Reddy would obviously like to increase his political power
 vahiin bijepi bhi dakshin main nae saathi se haath milakar siyaasi jameen ko majboot karne kii firaaq main he
 Even before the election, BJP President Amit Shah has given a call to all the parties and said that we welcome those parties who want to join the NDA
 mulaakaat ke dauraan piem modi ne jagan mohan ko lagaaya galevahin chunaav se ain vakt pehle jagan mohan kah chuke hai ki ve andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa dene vaale kisi bhi dal kaa samarthan karenge
 Let me tell you that in the meeting with the Prime Minister on Sunday, Jagan demanded the grant of special state status to Andhra Pradesh as well as the Central Government to release funds for his state
 jiske baad piem modi ne bhi unhen har mumkin madad dene kaa aashwaasan diya he
 In such a situation, the strong possibility of the NDA getting a new partner in the form of Jagan Mohan Reddy cannot be ruled out
 gauratlab he ki andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ke maamle par ravivaar ko hi jagan mohan ne kaha ki agar bijepi loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 250 siten jitati to halaat kuch or hote
 We would then give support only on the condition of giving special state status
 ab bijepi ke paas bahumat he, phir bhi ham vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang uthaate rahenge

 He wrote "some leaders are seen only during elections in the state, spend the rest of their time in Tughlaqi palaces

 Today people all over the country are celebrating Hanuman Jayanti
 maryaada purushottam shriram ke bhakt hanuman ko bajrangbali, pawan putr, anjani putr ke naam se bhi pahachaanaa jaataa he
 According to Hinduism, worshiping Hanuman ji all the troubles of a person are averted
 aise main aaie jaanate hai aakhir kya hota he hanumanashtak or kya he isse judi kahani
 Sankatmochan Hanumanashtak was structured by Goswami Tulsidas
 mana jaataa he ki hanuman jayanti par sankatmochan hanumanashtak kaa paath karne se vyakti ko apni har baadha or pidaa se mukti milane ke saath uske sabhi sankat dur ho jate hai
 Before the creation of Sarvapaidahar Hanumanashtak, Bajrang Bali gave a glimpse of Tulsi Baba like this
 
 
 ramcharitmanas ke rachanaakaar goswami tulsidas kii karmasthali ayodhya, kaashi or chitrakoot rahi
 Tulsidas used to sing Ramakatha at that time
 jise shraddhalu bhavvibhor hokar sunne vahaan aate the
 It is said that Ramarsik, a leper man among the listeners of Ramkatha, used to come there everyday to listen to the story
 kathapurna hone par vah chupchaap vahaan se chalaa jaataa
 One day in the forest of Kashi, Tulsidas made up his mind to chase after Ramastuti the leprosy Ramkatha Rasik
 katha sunne ke baad jab sab log vahaan se chale gaye to us vyakti ke pair tulsibaba ne pakadakar shraddhaanavat ho unase uthhke vaastavik rup main darshan dene kaa aagrah kiya
 Shiva avatar Anjaneesut Hanuman appeared in devotion
 apane ishtdev ko apane saamne dekh tulsidas dhanya ho gaye
 After which he also composed Hanumanashtak with many immortal compositions inspired by Hanumanji
 bataate hai jis jagah tulsidas ji ko bajrangbali ke darshan hue the us sthaan par aaj sankatmochan hanuman mandir bana hua he
 In every era, not only in the Kali Yuga, Hanuman is considered to be the God who has overcome all the troubles of his devotees
 yahi vajah he ki unhen sankatmochak naam se bhi pukaara jaataa he
 Jyotishacharya Pandit Arunesh Kumar Sharma said that while Hanumanji had appeared to Tulsidasji, he was installed in a statue at the request of Tulsi Baba
 bhakton ke samast duhkhon kaa nivaaran karne ke liye tulsibaba ne hanuman ashtak kii rachana kii
 This Ashtapadiya eulogy makes Hanumanji realize his powers
 isse prasann hokar ve bhakton ke sab ksht har lete hai
 In childhood, Hanuman used to use all the powers in child accessible sports
 is par rishi ne unhe shraap diya ki jab tak unhen usiki shaktiyon kaa samaran na karaayaa jaae ve shaktiyaan vismrit rahengi
 Even in Ramcharitmanas, Jamwant reminded Mahabali Hanumanji of his powers
 hanumanashtak kaa pratham pad-hanumanashtak ke pratham pad main surya ko fal samaj munh main bhar lene kaa varnan kiya gaya he

 com / mjvzwzpa7e— ANI (@ani_news)january 3, 2016 After spending a year in Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Satta, known for his outspoken and sharp statements, he has begun to speak quite diligently
 unhone group edetorial diarector raaj chengappa, india today hindi ke sampadak anshuman tiwari or assistant editor ashish mishra ke saath kareeb ek ghante tak vibhinn muddon par baatcheet kii
 He kept a clear and candid opinion on the contentious issues while avoiding bitter talk against the opponents
 mukhyamantri se baatcheet ke mukhya anshahvirodhiyon kaa aarope he ki aap pradesh kii andekhi karke karnataka chunaav prachaar main jute hai or zyaadaatar samay lakhanu kii jagah gorakhpur main bitaate he
 i understand that none of the three Chief Ministers who have been in power during the last 15 years would have visited the state as much as i did
 phir bhi main unke mukaable zyada samay apane karyaalay main maujuud rahaa
 See for yourself how fast we have worked on major schemes
 2014 se 2017 ke dauraan rajya main pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat ek bhi makaan kaa nirmaan nahin hua tha jabaki hamane garibon ko 8
 85 lakh houses were built
 aaj saarvajanik awaas yojana sambandhi pradarshan main uttar pradesh desh kaa number-1 rajya he
 Four lakh toilets were built for the poor in the state under the Prime Minister's Clean India Scheme
 56,000 pariwaron ko bijli uplabdh karai gai
 Even after so many years of independence, there were about 32 lakh families who did not have electricity connections, we brought electricity to their homes
 rajya main 1
 We pitched 2 lakh km of road
 agar aapaki sarkaar itnaa acha kaam kar rahi thi to gorakhpur or phulpur main hue loksabhaa ke upachunaavon main bhaajapa kii haar kyon hui?gorakhpur kii haar hamaare liye sabak he
 Certainly the reason for this was the party's overconfidence
 har kaaryakarta jeet ko lekar ekadam nishcint tha
 But when i reached Gorakhpur just before the election, the picture there was completely different
 durbhagyavash hamaara pratyaashee usee samay biimaar ho gaya
 The lesson is that we should always be alert
 har chunaav bhavishya ke liye ek sikh he
 Are you not worried that you got a tremendous mandate in the assembly elections just a year ago, then lost in two bypolls to the parliamentary seats? By-elections are never seen as a referendum on the functioning of the government
 abhi jab pradesh main samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar thi, upachunaavon main zyaadaatar siton par uski jeet hui, lekin vidhansabha chunaavon main zyaadaatar siton par vah haar gai
 Local factors play a large role in by-elections
 gorakhpur upachunaav haar jane ke baad kya aapako istife kii peshkash nahin kerani chahie thi, kyonki ise aapke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav kii tarah dekha ja rahaa tha?nahin
 As i just said, there is no correlation between the by-elections and trust in the government
 upachunaav sthaneey muddon or jatigat samikarnon ke aadhaar par lade jate hai or agar aap ativishwaas main rahete hai to ye kaarak bade ghaatak ho sakate hai
 Which areas should be your priority as Chief Minister? My priority was to improve the image of the state lying in politics of caste and familism
 uttar pradesh bhrashtachar ke kaaran pangu ho chukaa tha or rajya main kanoon-vyavastha kii sthiti badahaal ho chuki thi
 We changed the atmosphere of the state and created an administration that was focused on the needs of the common people rather than particular people and castes
 ab sarkaar kisaanon, yuvaaon, mahilaon or pichhadon ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 80,000 crore in bank accounts of farmers under DBT (direct Benefit Transfer)
 se adhik kii raashi pahunchaai gai
 Between 2012-13 to 2017-18, sugarcane farmers have about Rs 25,000 crore
 kaa bakaayaa hamaari sarkaar ne chukaaya or isi vitt varsh main unhen 18,000 karod ru
 Assistance amount of Rs
 pehle kii sarkaar ne 1994 main kareeb 250 vikaas khandon ko "dark jone'' ghoshit kar rakhaa tha
 Farmers in these areas did not get electricity for tubewells, so they had to run tubewells with diesel
 ham logon ne in vikaas khandon kii jaanch kar unhen "dark jone'' se mukt kar kisaanon ko tubewel uplabdh karaae or aaj ve bijli kaa bill dene main sakasham hai
 Solar pumps were made available to around 20,000 farmers
 aath sinchai pariyojnaayen varshon se lambit thim
 We have started six of them by 31 March and two of them are going to be completed very soon
 pichhali sarkaar ke shasankaal main rajya ke sirf chaar jilon ko puri bijli milti thi, jabaki 71 jilon ko kareeb 2-3 ghante kii
 Today our government is providing 18 hours of electricity even in rural areas
 kisaanon kii rin maafee ke kaaran rajya ke bajet par kaaphi boj padaa or duusari pariyojnaon ke liye paise nahin bache
 The state is almost broken
 jab ham satta main aae, rajya kaa khajaana khaali tha
 The state was in a bad state
 ham sthiti ko thik karne kii puure man se koshish kar rahe hai
 Whether it is about loan waiver of farmers or to start other new schemes, we did all this work from the state fund itself
 hamane centre sarkaar yaa bainkon se koi paisa nahin liya or na hi karj maafee ke liye kisi tarah kaa koi bond jari kiya
 We were the first to curb unnecessary expenses and stop the misuse of money in government schemes
 rashan card ke veriphication se pataa chalaa ki kareeb 30 lakh rashan card farji the
 We have improved the implementation of many state schemes related to electrification, drinking water, irrigation, rural welfare, etc
 isamen andeh nahin ki rajya kii vittiya sthiti ab bhi chunauteepurn he, lekin mujhe khushi he ki ham etharabm (vittiya uttardaayitv or bajet prabandhan) adhinium kii simaaon ke bheetar kaam kar rahe hai
 We stopped all those expenses which were avoidable and tried our best to ensure that every penny of the state exchequer was spent in the interest of the state
 audyogic drushti se uttar pradesh ab bhi pichhadaa rajya he
 What have you done to improve the investment climate? For investment, it is most important that law and order should be better in the state, so that people can do business without fear and their files are not stuck in the administrative space
 mujhe khushi he ki niveshkon ke liye prashasnic manjuuri kii ek sucharu prakriya or rajya main kaarobaar ke liye upyukt maahaul banane main ham safal hue hai
 Today, the investor is feeling the changed environment in Uttar Pradesh and seeing it as the most competitive state as compared to other regions
 main yah isliye nahin kah rahaa kyonki main yahaan kaa mukhyamantri hum, balki yah 21-22 farvari ke niveshak sammelan main bhaag lene vaale niveshkon kaa maananaa he
 He says that now there is favorable environment for investors here and this is the result of this conference that 4 in the state

 mujhe prasannataa he ki ham isi maah 35,000 karod ru

 Most development schemes are mired in controversies due to previous inept administration
 hamane paaya ki bank or vittiya santhaan bhi sarkaar ke saath kaam karne main kataraate hai
 Today not only commercial banks but every financial institution of the world wants to invest in the projects of Uttar Pradesh
 vikaas ke maamle main purvi or pashchimi uttar pradesh main gahari asamanta he
 What are you doing in this direction? There are many reasons for this disparity
 hamaari sarkaar ne rajya ke har ilaake ke liye ek samaan vikaas yojanaayen taiyaar kii hai
 In addition, almost every district of ours is a treasure house of traditional industry
 udhaaharan ke liye, muradabad main pital, aligarh main lohe, firozabad main shishe or khurja main crockeri kaa kaam ho rahaa he

 kitaab kaa naam:talash bhojpuri bhashaayi asmita keelekhak:ajit dubeprakashak:indica infomediamoolya:400 rupee17 may 2012 ko tatkaaleen grih mantri pi chidambaram ne sansad main kaha tha, 'ham raua sab ke bhaavana samaj tani'
 The whole country was surprised to hear these few words of Bhojpuri from the mouth of Tamil speaking and high class English speaking Chidambaram
 darasal, bhojpuri bhashaa ko aathvin anusuchee main shaamil karne ke sambandh main 15veen loksabhaa main laae gaye dhyanakarshan prastaav par chidambaram ne yah bharosa diya tha ki sansad ke aagaamee satr main is bill ko pesh kar diya jayega
 But now the winter session of the 16th Lok Sabha is going on and there is no trace of this bill
 bhojpuri samaaj ke adhyaksh ajit dube kii kitaab 'talash bhojpuri bhashaayi asmita kii' bhojpuri kii sanvaidhanik manyata ke liye desh-videsh main kiye gaye prayaason par kendrit he
 Dubey, the 'soldier' of the Bhojpuri language-asmita battle, has given details of the struggle against the English-based ruling establishment in his book
 yani bhojpuri ko sanvaidhanik manyata dilaane kii disha main ab tak jitne bhi kaam hue hai unamem yah ek behad khaas kitaab he
 In this book, not only will the history of the entire Bhojpuri language battle have been found, it will also get an account of the problems related to it
 kareeb hajaar varshon kaa itihaas samete duniyabar ke 16 deshon main 20 karod se bhi zyada logon dwaara boli jane vaali bhojpuri bhashaa aaj bhi sanvaidhanik manyata paane kii raah dekh rahi he
 This book presents the background of Bhojpuri language, literature, society, culture and tradition to the language of the constitutional status and struggles for the people
 kitaab main is kshetra main saamaajik prayaason ke alaava sansad main kiye gaye prayaason, sarkaar kii taraf se mili kore aashwaasano, sanvaidhanik manyata kii raah main aane vaali adchanon or in baadhaon ke samaadhaan ke upaay bhi sujhaaye gaye hai
 What does it mean for a language to be included in the eighth schedule? What benefits does that language bring to this? If the government has included 22 Indian languages in the 8th schedule till date, then why has the government hesitated to give this honor to Bhojpuri? What initiative has been taken by the government on this issue? These are all the questions that arise in Lal's mind in a Bhojpuria soil
 in tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab is kitaab main die gaye hai
 All languages like Maithili, Bodo, Konkani, Dogri have been included in the eighth schedule of the constitution but you may be surprised to know that the people speaking these languages are only in the millions, while Bhojpuri language is spoken more extensively

 The book also highlights the historical background of Bhojpuri language, literature, culture, cinema
 is kitaab kaa ek-ek lekh bhashaa ke samrajyavaadiyon ke sir par tani hui lathi he or iske shabd lok-devtaa ke sir se jhadate hue phool ke samaan hai
 However, this book talking about Bhojpuri is written in Hindi
 mere hisaab se agar yah kitaab bhojpuri main likhi gai hoti to shaayad is bhashaa ke saath behatar nyaay hota

 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' has started from today (friday), will run from 1 November to 3 November
 pehle din 'sahitya ajtak' ke 'sidhi baat' manch par 'raashtra yaa hindu raashtra' seshan main lekhak or patrkaar ashutosh, lekhika or patrkaar sabaa naqvi ke saath lekhak evam patrkaar vijay trivedi ne bhaag liya
 During this, all the three senior journalists kept their words smoothly
 is seshan kaa sanchaalan ajtak ke agjicutive editor rohit sardana ne kiya
 The books of the three guests were also mentioned at the beginning of the discussion
 charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue rohit ne kaha ki desh kaa koi dharm nahin hota lekin uske baavjood ham is baat se do-chaar hote hai ki kya bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 In the discussion first of all Ashutosh said that Hindu Rashtra is a project in itself
 or yah 1925 se shuru he
 i say that India is not just a country of Hindus
 hindu raashtra ek dharmik sampratyay he
 If you say that every person living here is Hindu then we have objection
 koi laalach dekar kisi kaa dharm parivartan nahin kar saktaa he
 No one can force their religion on someone
 us lihaaj se yah ek myth he ki bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 Confusion about Hindu Rashtra: Vijay Trivedi, Vijay Trivedi further said that there is confusion about Hindu Rashtra
 saavarkar ne sabase pehle hindu raashtra kaa concept diya tha
 The Union does not consider Savarkar's concept
 ashutosh jo kah rahe hai vah saavarkar kaa hindu raashtra he
 Golwalkar has said that the people who live in India are Hindus
 maujuuda sarasanghachaalak ne haal hi main spasht kiya he ki bina musalamaanon ke hindootv adhuraa he
 So i want to say that there is more confusion
 bharat ek dharmanirpeksh raashtra he: sabaa naqviiske baad sabaa naqvi ne apni baat rakhte hue kaha ki sanvaidhanik taur par bharat ek dharmanirpeksh raashtra he
 The Sangh has said that we are all Hindus
 lekin chaahe jo log bhi kahen ki musalamaanon ke bina hindu raashtra nahin ho saktaa he lekin aaj jo bharat main ho rahaa he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf hi he
 Article 370 was withdrawn in Kashmir, NRC was brought in Assam as it was a Muslim majority state
 bijepi ko incecyor nahin hona chahie lekin vah roj yah baat karti he ki musalamaanon ko vishesh darja mila hua he
 Today it is printed in an English newspaper that Muslims have become poorer than Dalits and Adivasis today
 main musalamaanon ke liye alag se baat nahin karnaa chaahati lekin aaj agar aap raashtra ko alpsankhyakon ke nazariye se dekhen to unhen lagata he ki hindu raashtra aa chukaa he, unako na to izzat milegi, unki citigenship par sawaal uthaae jaaenge or unki photo lagaakar nafrat kii najaron se dekhenge
 Religion cannot be the basis of any country: After the Saba Naqvi, Rohit Sardana said that if we go to the point of Saba, it means that the Hindu nation had arrived on 15 August 1947
 dharm ke aadhaar par do rashtron kaa bantwaaraa hua
 The followers of one religion came here while the other ones went there
 sabaa naqvi ne rohit ko tonkate hue kaha pakistan dharmik aadhaar par bana tha pakistan kaa matlab he jo bhi musalmaan nahin he vah napak he
 People of Pakistan could not live with Bengali Muslims
 pakistan main punjabi sindhi ke bich jhagade hote hai
 Religion cannot become the basis of any country
 agar aap aisa kah rahe hai to aap hindustan ko chota bana rahe hai

 ashutosh ne apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki main saidhantik taur par is baat ke khilaaf hum ki sarkaar main shaamil log saarvajanik rup se kisi dharmik aayojan kaa hissaa bane
 If Pandit Nehru made a mistake, i am not responsible for that
 hindu kya he isaki paribhaasha gandhi ji ne di he
 Gandhiji was asked if he considered himself a Hindu, then he said yes i consider myself a Hindu
 kyonki sanathan veda par meraa yakeen he
 Gandhi's Hinduism has mercy, compassion, affection
 saavarkar apni kitaab main likhte hai dayaa, mamat, karunaa kii baat karne vaale hindu ko kamjor karte hai
 He used the word coward
 saavarkar ke mutabik hindu raashtra kaa matlab he jahaan sirf hindu dharm kii baat ho
 People of other religions are as second citizens
 dinadayal kii ekatm maanavvaad main bhi kaha gaya he ki hamane 7 karod musalamaanon ko desh ke baahar nahin nikaal sakate
 But if they want to stay here then we can think of them
 agar ye hamaare hindu raashtra kii paribhaasha he to hamen aisa hindu raashtra nahin chahie
 And people are trying to create a Hindu nation like this in the past
 vijay trivedi ne apni baat rakhte hue kaha ki mind set main bada badlaav he
 Constitutionally, there is no separate here, both Muslims and Hindus vote together, but that is our mindset, when a big government of this country runs without any Muslim mission when one of the largest party in a big state
 If you do not consider anyone as your Muslim representative, then all these raise big questions
 lekin isse alag hai hindu
 The Hindustani of India is tolerant even today
 vah aaj bhi vasudaiv kutunbakam main bharosa karata he
 If it had not happened today, there would have been riots here
 aaj dange nahin ho rahe to uski vajah koi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik party nahin he, vah hindutv he
 Most of our people believe that Gandhi's Hindutva is referring to Gandhi
 swami vivekananda kaa hindutv, supreme court kaa hindutv or maujuuda raajnneetik system kaa hindutv aapse main kanfusion paidaa kar rahaa he or yahi hamen pareshaan kar rahaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi was the worst Prime Minister of India: Discussion between Saba Naqshisba said that there were all problems in India, i believe that the worst Prime Minister of India was Rajiv Gandhi
 unke jamaane main shah bano jajment ko overtern kiya gaya
 In his time, the Muslim Personal Law Board, in his time, the locks of the Babri Masjid were opened
 unhone sochaa ki thodaa muslim apijment, kyonki wo anaadi the
 He was a pilot
 ekadam se unki mata guzar gayi or wo pradhanmantri kii seat par aa gaye
 After the historical fault line that he opened, the entire direction of India changed
 hindu muslim muddon main jo unhone haath daalaa ek to muslim viman bill jo shah bano jajment ko overtern kiya or jo ramajnmabhumi ke mudde main chingaari unhone daal di
 Apart from that, a lot of things like Bhopal gas tragedy happened at that time, people of Union Carbide left
 hamaari sena ko srilanka bheja
 He made many mistakes
 anaadi pradhanmantri rah chuke hai
 There have been many mistakes of Congress
 unhone muslimon ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Only gave power to some people
 lekin unhone hindu muslim main het nahin paidaa kiya
 Riots do not happen because Hindu Muslims work together
 har jagah log saath kaam kar rahe hai
 Go to Aligarh, go to Benaras, everywhere people are working together
 hindutv ek vichaardhaara he hindu ek dharm he: ashutoshashutosh ne kaha hindutv ek vichaardhaara he hindu ek dharm he
 The same ideology is going on on the ground
 dayanand saraswati ne kaha sirf or sirf veda he
 Vivekananda said Hindu mind Muslim body
 aravindo ne kaha donon ko saath rahanaa he
 This is the ideology
 rohit ne kaha hindu dharm or hindutv main antar he
 Vijay Trivedi said that we consider union opposition as Hindu opposition
 sangh main swayamsevakon kii sankhya kareeb ek karod he is desh kii aabaadi he 130 karod usamen hindu hi yadi maan len to 80 karod se zyada he
 There are only 1 crore swayamsevaks out of 80 crores and we are considering opposition to Hinduism
 isliye ham sangh ko bhi takat de rahe hai or hinduon ko apamaanit bhi kar rahe hai kyonki agar 80 karod hindu sangh ko maanate to 80 karod swayamsevak hote
 12-15 crore people must have voted for the BJP, they are not all people of the Sangh, a lot of them are not even Hindus, hence the Confusion has to be overcome to oppose the Sangh as Hindu opposition
 sangh jo he hindu vichaardhaara ko maanata hoga lekin hindu vichaardhaara sangh kii vichaardhaara nahin he isko jab tak clear nahin karenge to ye roj vivaad chalata rahegaa roj ham log is par bahes karte rahenge

 ant main sabaa ne kaha hindustan ek bada mulk he, hindustan ne duniya ko badi-badi soch di hai
 Now we are going through such a phase that the weakest person in a democracy should feel that it is safe but nowadays whatever the Dalit, Adivasi and minorities may be, the government is strong, the RSS is strong as long as these weak Indians with compassion and love If we do not talk about it and just look at it with hatred, then our journey will stop
 ant main ashutosh ne kaha ki gandhi ji se jab poocha gaya ki aapkaa dharm kya he to unhone kaha ki saare dharmon main jo sabase acha he vahi meraa dharm he jabaki ve pehle kah chuke the ki main hindu hum

 agle loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan soshal media ke management main jute chuki congress ne apana twitor acount badal liya he
 Till now the official account of Congress on Twitter used to come from the handle @aicctweets
 magar aaj isi handle se folbers ko bataaya gaya ki hamaara nayaa acount @incindia ke naam se twitor par aa gaya he
 But this is not just a change of name
 donon twitor acount kii shakl o surat bhi badali hui he
 While the earlier Twitter account showed the picture of the early Congress session decades before independence, the home page of the new account shows the appearance of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh
 iske alaava vikaas kaa sanket karti kuch tasviren bhi najar aati hai
 However, why the picture of Sonia Gandhi was used twice is not understood
 is nae acount kii shuruyaat shanivaar 3 agast ko kii gai or isse pehla twit sonia gandhi ke bare main tha
 It was told that Mrs Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the issue of Durga Shakti Nagpal
 agar aankadon kii baat karen to abhi is acount ke folbers ek hajaar tak bhi nahin pahunch paae hai
 This account is following only 30 people, including the PMO, mostly Congress mps, spokespersons and some government departments
 haalanki pichhlaa acount bhi aankadon ke lihaaj se kuch khaas nahin kar paaya tha
 So far, only 2000 followers were made
 mumkin he ki congress nai ranneeti ke tahat party se judi khabaron ko lagaataar nae twitor acount se post kare or isse folbers kii sankhya main badhotaree ho jaae
 However, the pressure of Modi's cyber strategy on the Congress is clearly visible

 The discussion was initiated by BJP MP Hukumdev Narayan Yadav and a vote of thanks was also presented on his behalf
 hukumdev ne sadan main sambodhan dete hue kaha ki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav 'loktantr kaa mahabharat' hoga, jahaan muqabla lutere or camere ke bich main he
 He said that during the tenure of Modi government, the life of the poor has come to light and in the upcoming elections there will be religion and on the other side there will be army of unrighteousness, on one side there will be hut, on the other side there will be palace and poor standing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this election
 Will ensure their victory
 hukum dev narayan yadav ne kaha ki jaise pehle kurukshetra ke maidan main mahabharat hua tha, usee tarah is baar kaa chunaav bhi loktantr kaa mahabharat hoga
 Yadav said that Narendra Modi is representing the poor, hut, religion and in such a situation the poor will stand with him and again our government will be formed at the center
 unhone kaha ki raashtrapati ne apane abhibhaashan main mahatma gandhi, bhimrao ambedkar or ram manohar lohia kaa zikr kiya gaya tha or modi sarkaar in teenon mahapurushon ke siddhanton par hi kaam kar rahi he
 Referring to all the schemes of the looteremodi government, which took the removal of Modi, Yadav said that the work of ensuring economic equity was done through the construction of toilets, when the accounts of the poor were opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ne chori or lut karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai kii or ab ye log narendra modi ko hataane ke liye ek ho gaye hai
 Referring to social justice, he welcomed the decision to give 10 per cent reservation to economically poor people
 yahaan dekhen puraa bhaashan:hukumdev narayan yadav ne kisaanon ko har saal chah hajaar dene ke bajet prastaav kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki purvi uttar pradesh, bihar or desh ke kai pichde rajyon ke kisaanon ko is yojana kaa bahut laabh hoga
 He said that the farmers of delhi-ncr, not the poor farmers of remote areas, would be able to tell about its benefits, they have got great pleasure from the decision
 dalal or bichauliye pareshanvipakshi netaaon par nishaanaa sadhate hue yadav ne kaha ki paisa sidhe kisaanon ke khate main jaayegaa or aise main bichauliyon-dallalon ko kuch hasil nahin hoga, isi vajah se wo pareshaan he, tabhi modi ke khilaaf khadey ho rahe hai
 Meanwhile, members of the opposition, especially sp's Dharmendra Yadav, registered a strong objection to his remarks
 iske baad kaarywahi kareeb 10 minute ke liye sthagit bhi kerani padi
 The speaker told Dharmendra Yadav that if anything was said wrong then it would be removed from the proceedings
 congress or trinmul congress ke sadasyon kii narebaaji ke bich yadav ne kaha, ‘desh ke garib agle chunaav main narendra modi ke saath khadey honge or phir se bijepi kii jeet sunishchit karenge
 Recently, Yadav was also announced to be awarded the Padma Bhushan
 unhone kaha ki unako or gramin prishthbhumi ke kuch logon ko sammanit karke is sarkaar ne garib or pichhadon ko sammanit kiya he
 Earlier, just discussing the scams, while supporting the motion, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal said that for the first time it has happened that the opposition has no issue to speak against the government

 i want to ask what did you guys do for farmers in 10 years of government? He said that scams are being discussed before 2014, then in 2019, Ayushman Bharat, Ujjwala and other schemes are being discussed

 On Tuesday, it became clear that Akhilesh might be leaving on a yatra, but he himself would be the charioteer of his chariot, the party would not be firmly behind him
 yah baat us vakt saaf ho gai jab mangalvaar ko pradesh adhyaksh shivpal yadav party ke daftar main apane kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe the

 But there was no mention of Akhilesh Yadav in the entire meeting nor was any message given to the workers to make his rath yatra successful

 But Shivpal Yadav did not talk about the functioning of Akhilesh Yadav's government anywhere in the entire meeting
 balki unhen kaaryakartaaon se yah bhi kah diya yahaan bahut se log aise baithe hai jo samaajawaadee party main ho kar bhi satta kaa majaa nahin le sake
 Shivpal Yadav targeted Ram Gopal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav without taking names
 shivpal yadav ne kaha ki nijee swaarth ke liye kuch log party ke hit kii bali de rahe hai
 He said that Rhode was intentionally stuck on the merger and alliance with other parties of the Samajwadi Party
 shivpal yadav ne kaha ki agar bihar chunaav ke samay hi mahagathbandhan ho jaataa, to aaj mulaayam singh kaa kad kuch or hota
 Shivpal did not stop here and said that there are conspiracy people sitting within the party too and there is a need to be careful with them
 shivpal yadav se jab poocha gaya ki kya vah akhilesh yadav ke rath yatra kaarykram main jaaenge yaa nahin to shivpal ne iskaa koi saaf jawaab nahin diya
 If Mulayam Singh or Shiv Pal Yadav do not go to Akhilesh's Rath Yatra, the split within the party will open up

 trump ne kaha ki ham kai tarah ke product banaate hai, kai deshon main bechate hai
 But for a Harley Davidson bike we have to pay a lot of tax
 or ye desh koi or nahin balki bharat hi he

 After a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the party's leader Tejashwi Yadav went into anonymity and even once or twice, the leader did not appear in the role of opposition
 nitish ko diya endie main aane kaa nyotahal hi main argedy ke vidhayak dal or netaaon kii do-do baithak bulaai gayi lekin wo nahin aae baad main ek baithak ko radd karnaa padaa
 In such a situation, there is a sense of sadness in the entire party, the mlas do not understand under whose leadership they will contest the elections
 aise main party ke varisht netaaon ko party kaa bhavishya andhkaar main najar aa rahaa he
 The party's national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari invited Nitish Kumar to leave the NDA to join the grand alliance to lead the grand alliance
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah desh main sarkaar chal rahi he usase desh vibhajit hoga
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar is a leader who despite being in the NDA is a secular face
 unhone endie main aane kaa nyotaa dete hue kaha ki unhen idhar aana chahie ye samay kii maang he
 Shivanand Tiwari said that there is a situation of emptiness within the country, in this situation there will be a practical kind of alliance
 rashtriya str par isaki ek bhoomika ho sakati he
 After the split in the Grand Alliance, the party has made up its mind to contest separate elections from Nitish in Asbihar, while Jitan Ram Manjhi, who is in the Grand Alliance, has announced to contest the next election
 aise main mahagathbandhan bilkul bikhar chukaa he
 The Mahagathbandhan contested the 2019 elections under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav, but he completely failed in this, now the biggest crisis here is that of leadership
 2015 kaa vidhansabha mahagathbandhan ne nitish kumaar ke netritv main ladaa tha tab argedy 2010 ke 22 siton se 80 siton par pahunch gai lekin is baar kya hoga
 Tejashwi does not talk to his mlas and there is no hope of Lalu Yadav leaving the jail at the moment
 aise main party karen to karen kya isliye unhen natish kumaar main ek aas najar aati he
 Shivanand Tiwari praised Nitish Kumar and said that on the basis of his qualities, he can play an important role in national politics

 The Congress may shock former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu who resigned from the BJP and joined the Congress in the midst of elections
 siddhu baari bharkam jeet ke saath satta main ai amarinder singh sarkaar main dipti siem bananaa chaahate hai, lekin amarinder singh iske liye katai raji nahin bataae jate
 If he does, then Sidhu may get a shock
 captain ne diya he tarksiddhu ke bare main kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki wo punjab kii congress sarkaar main dipti siem ho sakate hai
 But according to information from sources, Captain Amarinder Singh does not want the position of Deputy CM in his cabinet
 captain amarinder singh kaa tark he ki dipti siem kaa pad tab diya jaataa he jab party ke paas bahumat naa ho or gathbandhan main kisi netaa ko sammaan dena ho yaa koi anya majaburi ho lekin punjab main congress baari bahumat se jeet kar ai he or aise main dipti siem ke pad kii jarurat nahin he
 Actually, according to the information received from the sources, Captain Amarinder Singh did not want someone parallel to him to be raised in the Punjab government, that is why he has been able to convince Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and the high command to a great extent that the Congress in the Punjab government There should not be a post of Deputy CM
 mil saktaa he bada mantralayasutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik navjot singh siddhu ko bataur cabinet mantri shapath dilwaai ja sakati he or unako koi baari-bharkam mantralay diya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, according to information received from sources, Navjot Singh Sidhu is still constantly trying to pressure the Congress high command and vice-president Rahul Gandhi and get the post of deputy CM
 philhal navjot singh siddhu dipti siem honge yaa nahin is par faisla shapath grahan se pehle antim kshanon main liya ja saktaa he kyonki shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye khud congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi chandigarh pahunch rahe hai
 By the way, the old leaders of Punjab Congress also do not want Kinvjot Singh Sidhujoki who has joined the party just 15 days before the assembly elections, to be placed second in the party after Captain Amarinder Singh
 haalanki khulkar navjot singh siddhu kaa virodh karne ko koi saamne nahin aa rahaa or sab kuch sahi dikhaane kii koshish karte hue tamaam netaa yahi kah rahe hai ki captain amarinder singh or navjot singh siddhu main kisi tarah kaa koi matbhed yaa fark nahin he or donon milakar punjab ke hit main ek saath kaam karenge
 Punjab Congress leaders are saying that the high command has given an open hand to Captain Amarinder Singh and it is Captain Amarinder Singh who will decide which ministry and which post will be given to the leader in his cabinet

 In the vast rural area of india, every year more than one thousand youth are killed by their own people
 inamen se 900 to akele ann ugane vaale punjab, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh main maare jate hai
 These murders are called 'honor killing' (murder for honor), and for each such killing, it is directly used as an excuse for the purity of caste or religion

 Megala and her man were 'punished' with sharp-edged weapons after continuously falling back, grabbing and then luring them back to the village
 kuttikulam gaanv ke log kehete hai ki gaanv ab ''shuddh'' he, lekin megala abhi bhi yah nahin samajh paa rahi hai ki unhone to ''apane dil kii baat hi suni thi'', us par unheen ke parivaaravaalon ne uske saath yah saluk kyon kiya
 And it is not just about the villages

 But a recent study by Shakti Vahini, an NGO, shows that in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, 72 percent of the 326 crimes related to 'honor' were related to inter-caste marriages in the last one year
