 " In the coming days, the price of pulses is going to decrease further and the price of tur, which is usually the most expensive selling tur, will fall to Rs 50 per kg
 lekin logon ke liye ye acchhee khabar, modi sarkaar ke liye bahut badi musiibat ban gayi he
 Sometimes the prices of pulses have skyrocketed and at times fallen completely, it has become such a problem for the central government that the government is sweating in dealing with it
 is vakt sarkaar ke saamne chunauti ye ki daal kii keemten bazaar main pehle se hi bahut neeche ja chuki hai or tuur daal shaharon main 75 se 80 rupe kilo bik rahi he
 But the government has a stock of 18 lakh tonnes of lentils, which will be spoiled if not consumed quickly
 daal ko ek dedh saal se zyada store nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, the government is compelled to remove the pulses from the store and bring it to the market and distribute it to the state governments
 udhar kharif kii fasal kii daal kuch hi dinon main bazaaron main aa jaaegi or sarkaar ke godaamon main or daal bhar jaaegi
 Government warehouses may be full but buying pulses at minimum support price is a compulsion of the government
 daal kaa stock khapaane kaa tarika tay kiya ja chukaa he
 Four lakh tonnes of pulses will be taken out of government warehouses and sold in the open market
 saadhe teen lakh ton daal dakshin bharat ke rajyon or gujarat ko diya jayega jo rashan kii dukaanon main baanta jayega
 Apart from this, the government will give 2 lakh tonnes of pulses to different government departments to get old pulses removed from the godown
 ab dikkat ye he ki sarkari godaamon kii itani daal jab bazaar main utregi to keemten or bhi kam ho jaaengi
 For the central government, buying pulses from farmers has become a loss deal because in many places the prices of pulses in the market have been less than the minimum support price
 godaamon kaa daal khapaane ke liekendra sarkaar ko ghate main daal bechnihogi
 Just two years ago, the price of tur dal reached Rs 200 per kg
 tab is baat ko lekar itnaa hangaamaa machaa ki sarkaar ko daal kii keemat neeche laane ke liye duniya bhar se daal aayaat karnaa pada
 Pulses were sourced from Myanmar to Africa
 daal kii keemton ko lekar itnaa bavaal machaa kii sarkaar ne keemton par kaabo paane ke liye or aage sthiti ko kaabo karne ke liye 20 lakh ton daal ke aayaat kaa bafer stock banane kaa faisla kiya
 But after this, there was a bumper yield of lentils last year
 daal kii aasmaan chooti hui keemton ko dekhakar puure bharat main kisaanon ne daal kii fasal khub lagaai
 As a result, pulses yield broke records and for the first time, imports of pulses in India dependent on imports from abroad had to be completely stopped
 yahi nahin kuch daal niryaat bhi kerani padi
 The government is now making huge stock of 20 lakh tons of pulses for pulses
 ab daal kii keemten neeche ja rahi hai sarkaar agar bazaar main or daal utaarti he to keemtee or neeche jaaengi
 If the prices are too low, the farmers who grow pulses will be upset and reduce the sowing of pulses for the next year
 lekin agar daal godaam se nahin nikali to rakhe-rekhe kharaab ho jaaegi
 The calculation is wrong in such a way that the most expensive selling arhar dal has become cheaper and the price of the most expensive gram dal has become more than the arhar
 isaki vajah yah he ki is baar arhar kii paidaavaar chanaa se zyada hui he
 Overall, it is proving to be a big challenge for the Modi government to keep pace with the supply and demand of pulses

 ' According to the information, big 'players' like Samajwadi Party and BJP have told Ajit Singh that they (ajit) will have to merge their party with them so as to avoid a situation of 'staggering loyalty' after the election
 darasal ajit ke trek record ne unhen aisa rukh apnaane ko vivash kiya he
 Ajit Singh has been a minister in the bjp-led NDA and the Congress-led UPA government at the Center
 isi tarah, upi main unki party, do prabal virdohi partiyon samaajawaadee party or mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party kii sahyogi rah chuki he

 The comments rashtriya lokdal ke netaaon ne kaha ki jaaton kii bahulata vaale upi ke 12 jilon kii 60 vidhansabha siton main unki party nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 Ajit Singh's party had a significant impact on up's Jats due to the image of his father and former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh nearly a decade ago
 lekin 'choudhary sahab' ke nidhan or 2014 ke aam chunaav main is party ke kamjor pradarshan ke kaaran sthiti pehle jaisi nahin rah gai he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, RLD could not win a single seat in UP
 iske baavjood kshetra main ajit singh kaa asar puri tarah se nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 It is believed that Ajit's support to any party can play a decisive role in the event of a close contest in the UP Assembly elections (which is very likely)
 samaajawaadee party ke ek netaa ne kaha, 'espi ke samarthan se ralod siten jeet sakati he

 ' The differences between Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal government and the Lieutenant Governor are nothing new

 Delhi government minister Kailash Gehlot wrote on social media that Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal objected to his government's pilgrimage scheme
 unhone sarkaar se kaha he ki vah is yojana ko sirf garib pariwaron tak hi simit rakhen
 On Kailash Gehlot's statement, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal targeted the Lieutenant Governor and said that the way in which he is hindering every functioning of his government, it will be difficult to run the government

 Gehlot said that it is not right to limit every scheme to only the poor sections

 Hindi is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the country
 Every year on 14 September, Hindi Day is celebrated
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Saturday that if any language can do the work of uniting the country, then it is Hindi
 hindi diwas ke maukey par unhone raashtra ko shubhakamanaayen deen or kaha ki bharat kai bhashaaon kaa desh he or har kisi kaa apana mahatv he
 But it is very important to have a language in the whole country, which should become its identity in the world
 aaj bharat ko ekta kii door main baandhne kaa kaam koi bhashaa kar sakati he to vah hindi he
 He insisted on increasing the use of Hindi in everyday works to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 hindi desh kii 22 anusuchit bhashaaon main se ek he
 Hindi Day is observed every year on 14 September
 shah ne kaha, 'aaj hindi diwas ke avasar par main desh ke sabhi nagarikon se apil karata hum ki ham apni-apni maatrubhaasha ke prayog ko badhayen or saath main hindi bhashaa kaa bhi prayog kar poojya baapu or louh purush sardaar patel ke desh kii ek bhashaa ke swapn ko saakaar karne main yogadan den
 Happy Hindi Day '
 unhone kaha, 'is duniya main kai desh hai jinaki bhashaaen vilupt ho gai hai
 a country that loses its language also loses its existence
 jo desh apni bhashaa kho detaa he, vah apni samskruti ko sangrakshit nahin kar saktaa
 # WATCH: Union Home Min Amit Shah says, "diversity of languages & dialects is strength of our nation
 But there is need for our nation to have one language,so that foreign languages don't find a place
 This is why our freedom fighters envisioned Hindi as 'raj bhasha'

 He wrote in the tweet, many congratulations to all of you on Hindi Divas
 bhashaa kii saralata, sahajata or shaleenta abhivyakti ko sarthakata pradaan karti he
 Hindi has incorporated these aspects beautifully
 vahiin congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne bhi is maukey par twit kiya
 He said, 'hindi is hope and desire, Hindi is the language that keeps everyone together

 The student told reporters that the incidents of rape happening in the country are very tragic
 inhen dekhte hue centre sarkaar ko 20 varsh tak ke yuvak or yuvatiyon dwaara mobile phone kaa upyog kiye jane par roak lagane ke liye kanoon bananaa chahie
 The comments iske alaava unhone yah bhi kaha ki desh me ashleel sangeet or filmon ke saath-saath behuda vigyapanon par bhi roak lagani chaiye
 The student said that the recent incidents of rape in the temple and madrasa have come to light
 ise dekhte hue mandir, masjid, carch or gurudwaron main mahila suraksha karmiyon kii tainaati honi chaiye
 Also, CCTV cameras should also be installed in madrasas and Shishu temples
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 ) Apart from this, he also said that vulgar music and films as well as inane advertisements should be banned in the country
 vidhyaarthee ne kaha ki haal main mandir or madrase main balaatkaar kii kathith ghatnaayen prakaash main aayi hai
 In view of this, women security personnel should be deployed in temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras

 ) rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke yuva netaa or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav kaa kahana he ki jeenyu ke purv adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ko ummidavaar banane ko lekar abhi koi faisla nahin hua he
 a decision in this regard will be taken after talks with the Left
 haalanki argedy pehle se hi kanhaiya kumaar ko ummidavaar banane ke paksh main nahin rahaa he
 One of the reasons for this is that Kanhaiya Kumar wants to contest from Begusarai and RJD believes that he has a strong candidate there
 jeenyu deshadroh maamle se charchit hue kanhaiya kumaar kii raajnneeti is maamle main chargeshit hote-hote kahin khatm na ho jaae
 Kanhaiya Kumar, accused of chanting anti-national slogans like 'bharat Tere Tukde Hoga', emerged in the politics of the country very fast and started shining like a horizon in the anti-bjp camp
 yahaan tak unhen bihar ke leningrad kahe jane vaale begusarai kaa bhavi saansad ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Kanhaiya Kumar also started working to build his land in Begusarai during this period, but in the grand alliance it seems that his pulse is not going to melt
 tikat par koi faisla nahintejasvi yadav ne spasht kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ke tikat ke maamle par abhi koi faisla nahin hua he
 He said that he would sit and talk to the party people
 abhi is masale ko lekar koi vichaar nahin hua he
 a charge sheet has been filed against Kanhaiya Kumar, accused of raising anti-national slogans in JNU in 2016, on January 14 this year
 haalanki isse pehle kanhaiya se jab bhi unke desh virdohi naaron ke lekar sawaal puche jate the tab unka yahi jawaab hota tha ki agar yah sach he to police chargeshit kyon nahin daakhil karti
 Now that the charge sheet has been filed in this case, it will be difficult for Kanhaiya to answer
 mahagathbandhan yah nahin chaahati ki aise sawaalon kaa jawaab unhen dena padey jisase bijepi ko phayda pahunche
 The CPI is still silent on the claim of Kanhaiya Kumar's ticket, but the Janata Dal u (JDU) says that Lalu Prasad Yadav, a convict in the corruption case, can distribute the ticket by staying in jail, then Kanhaiya Kumar will also get the ticket
 lalu le rahe bade faislejediu pravaktaa rajeev ranjan ne kaha, 'dekhie mahagathbandhan main aise sawaalon par mujhe nahin lagata ki koi bahut badi pareshaani he isliye mahagathbandhan ke sabase bade dal ke netaa lalu prasad sajayaftaa he or vahiin party ke har bade faisle le rahe hai
 He is taking the big decisions of the coalition, so only charge sheet has been filed against Kanhaiya Kumar

 Today the state has complete control over the media and its business

 This is happening in many countries of the world including India

 More than the number of times that Kiran Bedi was discussed between the elections in Delhi and its results, people remembered 'mulethi' and its 'potential' impact
 darasal, ek intervyuu ke dauraan kiran bedi garm pani se bhare glass ke saath najar ain
 When asked, she said that because of giving more speech, her throat dries more these days, so she drinks hot water
 jab unhen mulethi kaa seven karne kii naseehat di gai, to unhone kaha ki ve mulethi rakhti hai
 By the time Kiran Bedi's other things were digested to the public, Mulethi had already shown her 'influence'
 kai siyaasi 'gapodashankhon' ne kaha ki agar dilli ke ghar-ghar main bijepi ummidavaaron kii utani paith hoti, jitani mulethi kii he, to nattejey kuch or hote
 
 
 However, when Mulethi is in the discussion, it is also necessary to take note of its impact on health
 kya he mulethi:mulethi ek phydemand vanaspati he, jiskaa upyog kai rogon ke ilaaj main hota he
 Its plant is about 6 feet tall
 yah baahar se bhuri, par andar se pili najar aati he
 Once uprooted from the ground, it can be used as a medicine for about 2 years
 ayurveda ke anusaar, mulethi apane nayab gunon ke kaaran teenon dosha- vaat, kaph or pitt ko shant karti he
 It also has a name 'yashtimadhu'
 swaad main mithi hone kii vajah se iskaa yah naam padaa he
 The benefits of mulethi are mentioned in the texts related to Ayurveda
 iske 10 phaaydon kii yahaan charchaa kii gai he
 
 
 1
 gale kii kharash turant dur karne main mulethi behad madadgaar sabit hoti he
 In the condition of dry mouth repeatedly, liquorice also benefits
 2
 Liquorice also provides relief in dry cough
 kaali-mirch ke saath iskaa seven karne se kaph dhilaa hota he or raahat milti he
 3
 mulethi striyon ke kuch rogon ko bhi dur karti he
 It enhances beauty
 iske seven se motopa bhi dur hota he
 4
 isamen jeevanurodhi kshamta pai jaati he
 The root of liquorice proves to be very effective in healing stomach ulcers and wounds
 5
 There is no addition of liquorice in correcting digestion
 apach, afra, pechish, hyper acidity aadi main mulethi tatkaal asar dikhalaati he
 6
 miragi ke ilaaj main bhi iskaa istemaal dawa ke taur par hota he
 7
 aisa mana jaataa he ki niyamit taur par mulethi kaa seven karne se aawaaj madhur hoti he
 8
 ankhon kii sehat or sundarataa ke liye bhi mulethi kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 9
 vaise to mulethi shakkar se bhi zyada mithi hoti he, par diabetes kii beemaari main bhi iskaa istemaal hota he
 10

 a lesson
 jab koi mulethi khaane kaa aagrah kare, to isse inkaar karnaa nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 
 
 Bihar Chief Minister and National President of Janata Dal United Nitish Kumar has said on the results of Bihar in the Lok Sabha elections that this victory is the victory of the people of Bihar
 nitish ne ye baat patna pahunchane par airport par media waalon se baatcheet ke dauraan kahi
 This is being interpreted by Nitish's statement that he has said in a gesture to BJP leaders from Delhi to Patna that the NDA has got the thirty-nine seats in Bihar, because of the people who are their base in Bihar
 Found because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 nitish ne kaha ki chunaav ke dauraan maaloom kiya janaa chahie or logon ne dekha hai ki kis varg ke log kadi dhoop main matdaan kar rahe the
 Nitish's gesture will definitely be towards the backward castes who have voted overwhelmingly for the NDA
 nitish ne dilli se lautne ke baad do muddon par apni safaai di
 There was no discussion on any of his numbers in a cabinet
 unhone keval maang rakhi thi ki bhaajapa sahyogiyon ko samaanupatik aadhaar par sankhya de lekin unhone mana ki bhaajapa ko prachand bahumat hone ke kaaran is vishay par koi sankethik pratinidhiv se zyaada dilchaspee nahin thi

 Actress Deepika Padukone's two films so far this year, 'race 2' and 'yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' have done a business of 100 crores, but this actress does not give much importance to the 100 crores club
 is saal deepika ko 'res 2' kii box offis par safalataa ne utsahit kar diya
 Recently her 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' with old friend Ranbir Kapoor came and proved to be a box office hit
 'ye javaani he divaani' to relies ke shuruuaati hafte main hi 100 karod rupee kaa aankada paar karne vaali pehali film ban gai
 Deepika says, 'it feels good when your films work well and get appreciation
 yah ek bonus kii tarah hota he
 But i value the Rs 100 crore club
 main apane kaam par lagaataar dhyaan dena chaahati hum or acha kaam karnaa chaahati hum
 But what if a film is not good but it earns well? 
 i think all good films should go on
 'haal main masala filmein 100 karod rupee se adhik kaa kaarobaar kar rahi hai
 But Deepika feels that it is not right to attribute the success of the film to any one category
 unhone kaha 'jab 'ye javaani he divaani' or 'barfi' jaisi film chalati he yaa anya filmein kaarobaar acha karti hai to acha lagata he
 The success of the film cannot be tied to any category like it is an action film or it is a masala film, hence it works well
 sabhi acchhee filmein acha kaarobaar karengi
 Deepika's last three films 'cocktail', 'race 2' and 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' have done business well, but Deepika did not pay attention to this
 unhone kaha, 'main filmon ke bare main vishleshan nahin karti
 i love it when the audience likes my movies
 ' aam taur par jab koi kalakaar sthapit ho jaataa he to vah filmon kaa chayan bahut soch samaj kar karata he, lekin deepika kii soch thodi alag he
 She said, 'I work in the film that i feel thrilled
 main vahi film karti hum jiske liye mujhe lage ki yah karne par mujhe acha lagegaa
 Deepika made her Bollywood debut with 'om Shanti Om' alongside Shah Rukh Khan
 yah film superhit rahi thi
 After this, he played 'bachna Ae Haseeno', 'chandni Chowk to China', 'love Aaj Kal', 'housefull', 'karthik Kalinga Karthik', 'khelein Hum Jee Jaan Se', 'reservation', 'cocktail', 'race 2 'and worked in' Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani '
 inamen se zyaadaatar filmein box offis par thik raheen
 About her journey in the film industry, the 27-year-old actress said that she learned a lot here and the process is still going on
 unki aane vaali film rohit shetty kii 'chennai express' he or saal ke aakhir tak vah sanjay lila bhansaali kii 'ram lila' main najar aaengi
 Describing the victory of Anna Hazare against the corruption of the Congress party, Union Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said that the Congress Party wanted a stringent Lokpal Bill should be brought
 ab anna ne desh main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf janata ko jaagruk kar usamen ek nayi chetana bhar di he, to congress ko is bill ko sansad main paarit karaane main aasaani hogi
 Union Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said in a special conversation that Anna Hazare has agitated against corruption and filled a new awareness in the people of the country with a new awareness in it
 congress party bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf thi or vah kathor se kathor lokapal bill laana chaahati thi, lekin use dar tha ki yah bill kahin zyada kathor ho gaya to sansad main iskaa virodh ho jayega or anya raajnneetik dal ise paarit nahi hone denge
 He said that Anna Hazare made the work of Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh easier by fasting for the Lokpal Bill and connecting crores of people with the country
 isi kaaran congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii pahal par turat-phurat kaam hua or turant ek cameti kaa gathan kar diya gaya
 Jaiswal said that in a way, Anna's movement made it easier for the Congress Party to bring a rigid Lokpal bill and whatever political parties will oppose it in passing the bill in the Manasutra session of Parliament, they expose it to the public
 Will be done
 anna ke andolan se desh main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf janata ke ekajute hone ko loktantr ke liye ek acha kadam bataate huye kendriya mantri jaiswal ne kaha ki ab congress party is bill par jald se jald kaam karke ise loksabhaa ke aagaamee monsoon satr main pesh karengi or jo bhi raajnneetik dal iskaa virodh karenge unki janata ke saamne asaliyat khul jaayengi
 He said that then the public will know which party is against corruption and by taking drastic steps, wants to end corruption from the country and which party is secretly supporting corruption by opposing Lokpal bill
 jaiswal se jab kaha gaya ki bhartiya janata party ne pehle hi ghoshnaa kar di he ki vah is lokapal bill kaa virodh nahi karengi, to unhone kaha ki aisi ghoshnaa karnaa unki majaburi thi agar vah aisa na karte to janata ke saamne benakaab na ho jate
 He said that corruption has now become a national issue
 kendra sarkaar se jo karodon rupaya rajyon ke vikaas ke liye chalata he vah aam janata tak pahunchate pahunchate keval 20 fisadi hi bachataa he
 After all, where does the rest of the money go? Now with the introduction of this Lokpal Bill, not only corrupt ministers will be trapped, but officers will also not be able to get caught by it
 ve kehete he ki anna ke is andolan se keval bhrasht mantri hi nahi dar rahe hai, balki bhrasht adhikari bhi khauf khaaye huye hai
 Asked if this will completely eliminate corruption in the country, Jaiwal said in response to this that no, if not completely, it will be a little less
 bhrashtachariyon ke man main ek prakaar kaa khauf to bhar hi diya janata kii is aawaaj or ekajutata ne
 Union Minister Jaiswal said that the atmosphere against corruption that Anna has created in the country should remain so that the hands that were tied for any reason in the campaign against corruption of the Congress Party can remain open and the party can remove corruption from the country To take tough steps for unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh khud desh se is bhrashtachar rupi beemaari ko khatm karnaa chaahate he or ab unhen uchit maahaul mil gaya he to party kuch na kuch kade kadam to uthaayengi hi taaki desh main bhrashtachar par thodi bahut hi sahi lekin lagaam lagaayi ja sake
 He was asked that today people are comparing Anna to Mahatma Gandhi, then he said that no great man can be compared to any other great man
 gandhi ne jahaan desh se angrejon ko bhagane ke liye aandolan kiya tha, vahiin anna ne bhrashtachar ko hataane ke liye andolan kiya he
 Due to this people's movement, there will definitely be some fear in the minds of corrupt ministers and officials and this fear is very big work for the progress of the country

 The magistrate has these rights under CRPC Sec 125
 lekin pati kii aay ke adhikaar par hi patni ko milane vaala muaavja tay hoga
 Opposition question: Due to law, people's families will be broken? Government's answer: There is a provision of punishment for dowry and harassment against women in the country
 lekin isamen koi ye tathy nahin he ki isse parivaar tuutegaa
 Cross in Lok Sabha, challenge in Rajya Sabha
 Let us tell you that the Modi government has crossed a barrier on the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill-2017
 guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa ne teen talaak bill ko paas kar diya
 Now this bill will be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 agar modi sarkaar rajyasabha main bhi is vidheyak ko paas kara leti he, to phir isko raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke liye bheja jayega
 This bill will become law after the President is signed
 ab rajyasabha main is vidheyak par charchaa hogi, jahaan bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar kaa bahumat nahin he
 Opposition parties are protesting against the provision of punishment in this bill against triple talaq
 saath hi isamen sanshodhan kii maang kar rahe hai
 In the Lok Sabha also, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, including others, moved amendment proposals, but was rejected due to lack of support
 ab sarkaar ke liye rajyasabha se is bill ko paarit karana badi chunauti he
 You must remember that scene of Sholay movie! When Veeru i
e
 Dharmendra was about to let her climb on a water tank in order to convince her aunt to marry Basanti
 haalanki yah film thi lekin asal jindagi main ye stant kisi aadmi ne nahin balki ek bail ne kiya
 In Churu, Rajasthan, a bull climbed a water tank
 ghanto mashkkat ke baad bail ko neeche laayaa gaya
 In Churu district of Rajasthan, a bull climbed to a water tank with a height of 60 feet
 hairaani kii batyah he ki jab isaki tasviren twitor, fasebuk jaisi soshal netwarking site par share kii gai to logon ko is par vishwaas nahin hua
 Some called it Photoshop's awesome
 yahaan tak kii, jab sthaneey logon ne prashasan ko isaki soochna di to unhone bhi poocha kiaisa kaise sambhav he?beete somvaar ko sthaneey logon ne police ko phone kar isaki soochna di
 The police initially thought that someone was joking
 haalanki baad main kai colls aane par senior offisron kii team maukey par pahunchi
 The rescue team had to sweat a lot to save this bull
 shaam tak bail ko neeche na laa paane ke baad sena ko bhi kol kii gai
 However, the State Disaster Relief Force later found a solution
 jo ki kaam aayaa
 The rope used to draw water from the well was tied to the bull and the rope was thrown down from the other side
 bail ko sefti belt baandhi gai
 All four legs of the bull were tied with rope and were lowered
 bail ko neeche utaarne main 8 ghante lag gaye
 Rules for getting jobs Dayashankar Mishrabanten Booksi-9, Platinum Plaza Mata Mandir, Bhopal Price: Rs 150
 kabhi bhartiya vichaar paddati main naukari ko sabsenikrusht kaam mana jaataa tha
 But over time, the norms of society also change
 aaj haal yah he ki bharat kaa 40 karod kii aabaadi vaala madhyavarg naukari paane, usamen ram jane or phir use bhunaane ke liye betaab he
 Young journalist Dayashankar Mishra not only explored this pulse of the middle class, but also felt it as representing the same class
 pichley paanch saal se chali aa rahi mandi, uske bich main pis rahe profeshnals kii chantni or iske saath hi gadhe vakt main apni naav ko paar lagane main kaamyaab rahe logon kii kahaniyon ko lekhak ne kitaab kii shakl di he
 In his search, the author also collides with the traditional thinking, where it is believed that having the ability and hard work is the biggest virtue to get a job
 is takaraav kaa matlab yah nahin ki kitaab aap se an-ithical kaam karne ko kahati ho
 The book suggests a path between ideal and behavior that is neither illegal nor immoral
 kitaab yah bhi bataati he ki naukari paane ke baad vahaan tike kaise rahaa jaae or aage kaise badha jaae
 The author has resorted to anecdote by not adopting a purely dogmatic approach to expressing his point
 yah college se padhakar nikle or naukari kii talash main jute teen doston—rajesh, mahesh or ananda kii kahani he
 The fourth important character among the three is Professor Murthy
 in paatro kii jindagi main ghatati ghatnaayen, unke utaar-chadhaav, aapas kii vaicharik sir-footwwal or ant main safalataa kaa sabak seekhney kii daastaan hi kitaab kii kahani he
 The canvas of this book is very large
 lekhak jahaan sahvaag ke inkrement, tendulkar ke anger management tathaa rahul dravid ke dhairya kii baat karata he, vahiin steve jobs, tim cook, bill gates or stephen kavi kii choukhat par bhi dastak detaa he
 All in all, the rules of getting jobs do the necessary work of correcting them by inflicting huge blows on the impractical theoretical myths that have taken root in the minds of the people, so that people can get their own destination
 big bos ke ghar main jab tak prem kii pingen na paden majaa hi nahin aata he
 Last time there was a lot of romance between Gauhar and Kushal and Armaan and Tanisha
 is baar aise hi prem ke beej gautam gulati or diyandra ke bich padate najar aa rahe hai
 Both are enjoying their game in Bigg Boss house
 in dinon aksar unhen ishk farmaate or ek-duusare ke saath chuhalbaji karte dekha ja saktaa he
 The two are seen having fun in the bedroom when Diandra says that she wants to give Gautam a birthday gift
 diyandra se gift kii baat sunakar gautam josh main najar aane ke saath hi kuch nervas bhi najar aaenge
 The new relationship between the two will quickly take shape and Diandra will ask Gautam if he is scared
 Gautam seems a little surprised about Diandra's intentions, so they will ask him what is on his mind and will point towards the cameras
 uske baad diyandra gautam kaa haath pakadegi or use bathroom main le jaaengi or andar se darwaja band kar lengi
 When the two come out of the bathroom, Karishma will ask Diandra what happened between the two
 diyandra sharamaate hue pehle to karishma ke sawaal se kanni kaatane kii koshish karengi, lekin baad main ve kahengi ki unhone gautam ko janmdin kaa gift de diya he
 Eventually both of them can be seen dancing on the romantic title track of Hum Tum
 sonaali ko bhi gautam se ishk?aaj sonaali bhi gautam ke saamne apane ishk kaa izhaar karengi
 After listening to which Gautam will be surprised
 sonaali kahengi ki ve unhen yahi kahati ai hai ki ve unhen pasand karti hai, lekin ve to unase ishk karti hai
 She will say that her words matter and she could not express her feelings due to Gautam's attitude
 gautam kahenge ki tumne kabhi yah baat bataai nahin
 But Gautam will not give him any special attention and will take his way
 isi tarah sonaali bhi apni raah chali jaaengi

 The dictator of North Korea has created such a dictatorship in his country that people are now afraid of sleeping
 is taanashaah ke saamne galati se kisi ko sirf halki si jhapai bhi aa gai to samaj lijie ki bas ab wo maut kii neend hi soyega
 The Education Minister was shot dead, North Korean dictator Kim Jeng Un, who sentenced his Defense Minister to death in lieu of this sleep, has now given his Education Minister the death penalty after firing him in the same manner
 shiksha mantri kii galati bas itani thi ki ek meeting main unhen halki si jhapai aa gai thi
 Kim Jong-un fired his own Education Minister Kim Yong Jin (63 years) simply because he was not sitting properly in Parliament
 shootaron ne unke seene par goli maar kar unhen maut kii neend sula diya
 Even if the orders of death are not accepted, many other leaders and officers of North Korea are also facing different punishments for directly or indirectly challenging the dictatorship of Kim Jong Un
 kim yong chol or chol havi naam ke do afasaron ko taanashaah kim jong un ne apane idological ri-adukeshan centre main bhej diya he
 Where they are being taught the lesson of obeying the dictator
 haalanki kuch media reports ke mutabik haal hi main do or afasaron or netaaon ko north korea main anti aircraft gan se uda die jane kii khabaren di hai
 However the North Korea regime has denied these reports
 vaise yahaan zikr-e-khaas he ki kim jong un pehle bhi apni hukmduli karne waalon ko maut ke ghat utarava chukaa he
 These include his uncle Jung Song himself and former defense minister Hyun Yong Chol
 aatmghaatee hamalaavaron kii fouj taiyaar karne kaa faislakahete hai duniya main us shaks se zyada khatarnaak koi nahin jo khud marane ke liye taiyaar ho
 Human bombs are called such people
 uttar korea ke sanakee taanashaah ne ab aise aatmghaatee hamalaavaron kii fouj taiyaar karne kaa faisla kiya he, jo sidhe parmaanu bam phodenge
 If this idea is successful, then just understand that there will be ruin and destruction all around
 north korea ketanashaah kim jong unne iske liye apane sipahasalaron ko hukum diya he
 His second in commander has to ask the army to select such soldiers who are ready to execute nuclear attacks and die for the country
 kim jong un kii ye brigade dakshin korea ke border par aise hi backpac yani pitthu parmaanu bamon se las kar tainaat hogi
 As soon as the opportunity arises, it will sneak into South Korea's territory and attack
 sajeesh ke mutabik ye faujee duusare aatmghaatee hamalaavaron kii tarah apane jism main parmaanu bam baandh kar taiyaar rahenge or mauka milte hi dushman ke ilaake main ghus kar apane jism main bam ko datonet kar lenge
 Although this is not clear yet, it is understood that Kim Jong Un's fate is actually inspired by Japanese suicide bomber pilots during World War II, who often target their ships with warships and destroy them
 Used to do it
 parmaanu aatmghaatee hamalaavaron kii toli banane juta north korea aise hamalaavaron ke jariye koi bada dhamaakaa karne kii bajaay radioective meterial bikherne par zyada jor denge
 This will cause maximum harm in enemy's camp along with loss of life
 parmaanu hathiyaaron se las pandubbi banane main juta north korianorth korea kaa ye sanakee taanashaah parmaanu hathiyaaron se las ek pandubbi bhi banane main juta he
 a 3000-tonne submarine, built using pieces of submarine, is a Russian submarine, ready to be equipped with nuclear missiles
 puri duniya ke liye ye isliye bhi ek bade phikr kii baat he, kyonki parmaanu takanic ke maamle main takreeban puri duniya ne hi north korea ko khud se alag-thalag kar rakhaa he
 Despite this, its scientists are constantly working with full force to make nuclear weapons
 aise main agar parmaanu hathiyaar se las aisi koi pandubbi banane main north korea kaamyaab ho jaataa he, to uskaa yakeenan puri duniya ke liye ek nayaa sirdard bananaa tay he
 Because in North Korea, there is a secret dictator and he can do anything with anyone at any time
 kai mulkon ke liye he khatre kii ghantigenvari maheene main hi duniya ke tamaam mulkon ke saath-saath yuan yani sanyukt raashtra sangh ke virodh ke baavjood north korea ne parmaanu bam kaa pareekshan kar logon kii peshaani par bal daal diya tha
 Experts believe that so far North Korea has been successful in producing missiles that can travel up to 125 hundred miles
 dakshin korea ke saath-saath north korea ke is range main aane vaale kai duusare mulkon ke liye bhi ek khatre kii ghanti he
 The new accusation against the young American dictator Kim Jong Un and his family members was extremely strange
 south korea ne khulaasa kiya he ki kim jong un ne sirf angreji seekhney ke liye ek america noujvaan ko 12 saal pehle tab agava kar liya tha, jab wo china main ghoomane gaya tha
 The world was still considering this young man dead
 jis shaks ko log mara hua maan kar apane kaleje par pathar rakh chuke he, wo shaks ab naa sirf jinda mila he, balki ye pataa chalaa he ki use ab tak kisi or ne nahin balki north korea ke usee sanakee taanashaah ne apni kaid main rakhaa tha
 Whom the world knows as Kim Jong Un
 vah use apane kabje main lekar usase angreji sikh rahaa tha
 The disclosure may be shocking, but a South Korean organization has revealed something similar
 24 saal kaa david sneden 2004 main america se china ghoomane gaya tha
 It is now revealed that he was kidnapped to teach English to Kim Jong Un in those days
 iske baad david naa sirf north korea main rah gaya, balki vahiin pyongyang main usne shaadi kar apana ghar bhi basaa liya
 If the players are also punished for losing in the Rio Olympics, if the players of any country have to pay the price of defeat in the Olympics, what would you call it? But the country in which the reigning dictator reigns, it is possible
 north korea ke sanakee taanashaah kim jong un ne ab olympic se haar kar laute khilaadiyon ko khadaanon main mazdooree ke liye bhejne kaa faisla kiya he
 Those close to Kim believe that the soon-to-be dictator may perform poorly in the Rio Olympics and shift players returned to substandard houses as punishment, and their rations may be reduced
 2010 ke footbal team ko di thi sajaa2010 ke world cap main north korea kii footbal team portugal se haar gai thi, to team ke coach samet sabhi khilaadiyon kii suvidhaayen ghataakar unhen mins main bhej diya gaya tha
 History seems to be repeating itself
 haalanki tab footbal team ke khilaadiyon kii do saal baad hi ghar vaapasi bhi ho gai thi
 The goal was to win 17 medals in the Rio Olympics
 targetkim had set a target of winning 17 medals in the Rio Olympics
 lekin khilaadi sirf 7 hi medal jeet sake
 According to the Korean Times, Kim Jong had targeted the head of the Sports Commission to win 5 gold and 12 medals
 north korea se 9 sports ke liye 31 athlete gaye the
 Only 7 medals were won, of which only two are gold medals
 kim kii sabase badi chidh ye he ki uske jaani dushman desh south korea ne 21 medal jite hai, jinamein 9 gold medal hai

 kaarykram main shaamil hone ke liye khud samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne guuruuvaar kii raat nitish kumaar ko phone kiya tha
 Nitish Kumar has said that it is difficult to go to Lucknow in the program of November 5, because Chhath festival is being celebrated in Bihar and this puja is also done in his own house
 5 november ko kharnaa bhi he
 Earlier, Samajwadi Party state president Shivpal Yadav sent an invitation to Nitish Kumar for this program three days ago
 mulaayam bananaa chaahate hai mahagathbandhansutron ke mutabik janata dal united ke purv adhyaksh or party ke saansad sharad yadav party ke taraf selkhanu main hone vaale kaarykramame shirkat karenge
 It is worth mentioning that on the occasion of Samajwadi Party's Silver Jubilee Program, Mulayam Singh Yadav's effort is to bring all Samajwadi parties under one roof and form a grand alliance
 taaki aagaamee uttar pradesh chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf ek majboot morcha khadaa kiya ja sake
 It is believed that Nitish Kumar is avoiding any kind of grand alliance with Samajwadi Party, because after the heated up between Akhilesh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav, there is a possibility that if everything in the family is not calm then Akhilesh Yadav may contest separate elections
 nitish kumaar chaahate hai ki agar koi mahagathbandhan uttar pradesh chunaav se pehle banataa he to usamen akhilesh yadav jarur shaamil rahe

 The concept of the film has been prepared by looking at young India, especially small town
 film kaa har kairactor manoranjan kaa dhamal he
 Amit Roy is going to step into direction from this film
 isse pehle ve ramgopal verma kii sarkaar or rohan sippi kii dam maaro dam main cinemetographer rah chuke hai

 mangalvaar ko seepi half de band rahaa
 There was a lockout in the shops till 3 in the afternoon
 no car, no kaarobaar ke naare ke saath kaarobaari phir ekajute ho gaye hai
 In fact, ndmc's plan to make the inner circle of Connaught Place as a vehicle-free zone for the next three months under the pilot project is not acceptable to the New Delhi Trade Association
 kaarobaariyon kii maane to seepi ko whical free karne se seepi na sirf kaarobaariyon kaa nuksaan hoga, balki seepi ke sabase badi trading hub hone kii pahchaan ko bhi dhakka lagegaa
 Let me tell you that the traders association and NDMC have been confronted many times before on the plan to make CP free
 lekin ab kaarobaariyon ne virodh ke chalate half de seepi band kar seepi bachaao abhiyaan shuru kiya
 Businessmen closed all shops and restaurants and demonstrated
 nai dilli treders association ke president atul bhargav ke mutabik seepi ek trading hub he, ise tourist place kii tarah dekhnaa band karen
 Secondly NDMC should focus on traffic management along with facilitating pedestrians
 is tarah seepi ke parking place main fawwaare laga dena kis tarah kaa samaadhaan he
 He said, 'people like to come to CP because here you feel safe till late in the evening or even at night and instead of carrying shopping bags while shopping, you put them directly in the car
 yoga diwas par bhi seepi ke kaarobaariyon kaa kareeb 40 fisad nuksaan hua tha
 Can't understand why every experiment is with CP
 pehle metro, phir kaamanwealth games ke dauraan renovations or ab ek nai yojana, jisase ek bhi kaarobaari khush nahin hai
 'what is the proposal of NDMC? Let me tell you that this proposal was given by NDMC to the businessmen, which they rejected outright
 prastaav is prakaar he :seepi main trephic system or parking main badlaav jayega
 The movement of trains on the inner circle will be restricted for three months
 seepi ke butification ke chalate parking place main fawwaare or khubasurat liting kii jaaegi
 Trains passing through the CP must pass through the outer circle
 seepi main sabhi vaahanon kii entry janpath se hogi
 Baba will exit from Kharak Singh Road
 log apni gaadi janpath yaa baba kharag singh par park karke bydaree chaalit vaahanon se inner cirkil main aa sakenge

 As soon as the Aam Admi Party won any assembly seat and the leaders announced it from the balcony, there was tremendous enthusiasm among the supporters below
 arvind kejariwal ke netritv vaali nausikhua aam aadmi party (aap) ne antat: 28 siten or 29 fisadi vot hasil karke na keval dilli main 15 saal se shashan kar rahi congress ko bedakhal kar diya balki mukhya vipakshi dal bijepi ko bhi satta ke bilkul muhane par atka diya
 Since then, the political landscape has changed dramatically
 aap ne dilli main 49 din tak satta sanbhali
 There was a long period of President's rule after that
 is dauraananarendra modi kii bijepine centre main satta kabja lee or dilli kii bhi saaton loksabhaa siton par jeet hasil kii
 Now this metropolitan-state is getting ready for the next round of assembly elections on 7 February
 aise main ek baat jas kii tas he- kejariwal ab bhi badi takat hai
 This is not only evident from many surveys in which he is continuously emerging as the first choice for the post of Chief Minister, but it also comes from the fact that Prime Minister Modi himself gave him the BJP at the Ramlila Maidan rally on January 10
 Conferred as the foremost competitor of aam chunaavon main dilli ke 70 main se 60 vidhansabha kshetron main bijepi ko badhat mili thi
 To reverse the situation, Kejriwal is taking AAP beyond his NGO / activist roots and turning it into a party with a strong structure
 kejariwal ko kya he phaaydakejariwal ne modi ke loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke bhi ek gur ko hathiyaa liya he
 Party strategists say that Kejriwal had addressed 50 assembly-level public meetings in Delhi before Modi's rally at Ramlila Maidan
 kejariwal ko ek yah bhi phayda hasil he ki jahaan modi suraksha ke tamajham ke kaaran sirf badi sabhaayen kar sakate hai, vahiin kejariwal gali-muhalle main uplabdh hai
 Senior AAP leaders are addressing such public meetings almost daily
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki unka lakshya matdaan ke din tak har vidhansabha kshetra main 8-10 jansabhaayen kar lene kaa he
 Senior AAP leader Yogendra Yadav says, 'in other states, the BJP faced the then governments with tarnished image and there was no popular face in front, but this is not the case in Delhi
 'aap kii nai dhanchaagat majbootee ke liye swayamsevi sahyog or soshal media main sakriyata kii bharpoor madad lee ja rahi he
 It has also been beneficial for you in the past
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki dilli main prachaar ke liye unhen deshbhar se paanch se das hajaar kaaryakartaaon ke dilli main jutane kii ummid he
 It may be less than the number that the party had gathered during the 2013 assembly elections, but this time they will be better aware of the electoral process
 ye kaaryakarta pehle hi aap ke soshal media abhiyaan ko jamkar hawa de rahe hai, taaki ek maahaul kaayam ho sake or saath hi ve nukkad naatakon or flash mob abhiyaan kii bhi puri madad le rahe hai
 The party dodged the BJP and put up hoardings of Kejriwal at 80 special places across Delhi
 isse kam hording ke baavjood aap kii maujuudagi bijepi jaisi dikh rahi he
 Kejriwal organized multi-publicized resource-raising events in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Dubai for the party's election campaign
 lekin saath hi vidhansabha kshetra ke str par bhi sansaadhan jutaney ke kaarykram chal rahe hai
 This effort will not only raise money, but will also get the support of the middle class about whom it was said that it has gone away from AAP
 kejariwal pehle hi aise 13 kaaryakramon main shirkat kar chuke hai
 Though the uncertainty regarding the middle class is surely bothering the party a bit, but it is also hopeful that the declining enthusiasm towards the Congress will give AAP the majority of the votes of the Muslims too
 party 2013 main ubharkar saamne aae kamjor pahaluon par bhi kaam kar rahi he, jaise gramin bahari dilli jahaan usne 12 main se keval ek seat par jeet hasil kii thi
 She is opposing the central government's ordinance on land acquisition by organizing public meetings
 aap ne apane 21 vidhayakon ko phir se tikat diya he lekin baaki siton par vah un logon par mukhya rup se nirbhar he jinhen aam chunaavon ke turant baad party sanghathan khadaa karne ke liye alag-alag vidhansabha kshetra saunpe gaye the
 The party has selected 48 candidates from among them
 iske alaava party ne chaar kaaryakartaaon ko bhi tikat die hai
 Central control: The Delhi unit of the BJP was confused about whether to form a government in Delhi by manipulation, while the bjp-led central government announced several steps for Delhi under President's rule
 baaki logon ke alaava rajnath singh, em
 Union Ministers like Venkaiah Naidu, Nitin Gadkari and Piyush Goyal were also seen keeping the foundation stone of the capital in Delhi keeping an eye on the elections or opinion on serious issues
 jaahir tha ki bijepi kii dilli ikai ko kendriya shahari vikaas mantri naidu or urja mantri goyal kaa ramlila maidan kii raily ko sambodhit karke dilli ke vikaas ke centre main sarkaar ke yogadan ko ginanaa upyukt hi laga
 In the meantime, the parachute of former IPS Kiran Bedi landed in the party the very next day of the sharp shock to Upadhyay's image
 arun jetali or amit shah kii maujuudagi main ve party main ain or usee din modi se bhi mil leen
 He was immediately seen as the chief ministerial candidate
 vaise bhi pichhali baar mukhyamantri ke rup main uskaa cheharaa harshavardhan ab centre main mantri hai or vidhansabha chunaavon kii daud tak main shaamil nahin hai
 Smriti Irani, Vijay Goel, Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay are also discussed
 lekin kuch bhi pukhta nahin he
 In such a situation, Kejriwal has been ahead in the race due to his name and promise of keeping his promise

 Nutritious diet, yoga-meditation as well as regular routine are also necessary for good health
 dincharya main sahi vakt par neend lenaa bhi shaamil he
 The scriptures describe what should be the right way to sleep
 dakshin disha kii ore sir rakhane ke phydedakshin disha kii ore sir karke sona behatar mana gaya he
 In such a situation, the foot will naturally remain in the north direction
 shastron ke saath-saath prachlit manyataon ke anusaar, sehat ke lihaaj se is tarah sone kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 This belief is also based on scientific facts
 uttar kii ore kyon na rakhen sir?darasal,prithvi main chumbakeey shakti hoti he
 It has a continuous magnetic current flowing from south to north
 jab ham dakshin kii ore sir karke sote hai, to yah urja hamaare sir ore se pravesh karti he or pairon kii ore se baahar nikal jaati he
 In such a situation, people wake up in the morning and feel fresh and energized
 agar iske vipareet karen siriske vipareet, dakshin kii ore pair karke sone par chumbakeey dhara pairon se pravesh karegi he or sir tak pahonchegi
 This magnetic energy increases mental tension and the mind remains heavy when it is awakened in the morning
 purab kii ore bhi rakh sakate hai sirdusri sthiti yah ho sakati he ki sir purab or pair pashchim disha kii ore rakhaa jaae
 According to some beliefs, this situation is better described
 darasal, suraj purab kii ore se nikalataa he
 In the Sanatan Dharma, the Sun has been considered the life giver and deity
 aise main surya ke nikalne kii disha main pair karnaa uchit nahin mana ja saktaa
 Because of this, the head can be placed towards the east
 sone se jude kuch jaruri nirdesh
 
 
 - In the scriptures, sleeping is prohibited during the evening, especially at dusk
 --sone se kareeb 2 ghante pehle hi bhojan kar lenaa chahie
 Never eat food just before bedtime
 --agar bahut jaruri kaam na ho to raat main der tak nahin jaagnaa chahie
 As far as possible, try to keep the mind calm before sleeping
 --sone se pehle prabhu kaa samaran karnaa chahie or is anmol jivan ke liye unke prati aabhaar jataana chahie
 During the Lok Sabha proceedings today, two occasions came when Prime Minister Narendra Modi got stuck in an uncomfortable situation
 darasal, aaj loksabhaa ke spikar kaa chunaav hona tha
 Modi had to face the first uncomfortable situation during the proposal for Sumitra Mahajan's name
 loksabhaa spikar kaa chunaav ho rahaa tha
 There were 17 proposals in favor of Sumitra Mahajan
 15wein number kaa prastaav purv pradhanmantri echdi devegoda ko karnaa tha or anumodan anant kumaar ko karnaa tha
 Deve Gowda proposed but Ananth Kumar was not in the Lok Sabha at that time for approval
 sadanand gauda ne is par kaha ki main samarthan kar detaa hum
 Protem speaker Kamal Nath denied this and the motion was rejected
 iske baad, piem narendra modi loksabhaa main cabinet kaa parichay karvaa rahe the
 There is a tradition of introducing new ministers, Modi took the name of Energy Minister Piyush Goyal and went on to study his charge
 jab modi ne pard liya tab vipaksh se aawaaj ai ki piyush goyal to yahaan he hi nahin
 Actually Goyal was not in the House at that time
 vipaksh kii taraf se do chaar aawaaj ai, he hi nahin
 For five seconds, Modi stared back
 or bole, thik he phir main baad main parichay karvaa duungaa

 ) This is not the first case when the police in the major city of Madhya Pradesh have publicly 'punished' the alleged criminals or the accused
 ek taazavideomen indore main police vaale sadak ke bich main kuch logon se uthak-baithak kara rahe hai or bich-bich main dandon se peet bhi rahe hai
 DIG of Indore, Harinarayan Chari Mishra and Madhya Pradesh DGP Rishi Kumar Shukla have denied knowing the video
 ghatana ke bare main bataae jane par dijipi ne 'aaj tak dot in' se kaha he ki ve apane adhikari se baat karenge
 Police is doing good work - According to digmedia report, police is taking such action only on the orders of DIG Harinarayan
 aaj tak se baatcheet main diaiji ne aropiyon ko peetane kii jaankaree hone se inkaar kiya, lekin yah jarur kaha- 'unhen aropiyon kii samuhik giraftaar kii jaankaree he
 Our police is doing a good job
 ye 'samuhik karrwai' abhiyaanalgatarachal rahi he
 In response to another question, he said that the police should not conduct sit-ups
 media main karrwai ko 'aparaadhiyon kaa juluus' bataaya gaya he
 On a question related to this, the DIG said that they would prefer to call it a collective action of the police rather than the procession
 lagaataar chal rahi aisi karrwidiaiji ne khud sweekaar kiya he ki aisi karrwai karibek maheene sechalai ja rahi he
 In this, police of many police stations together catch criminals
 iske baad aropiyon ko sadak par ghumaya ja saktaa he or sajaa dete dikhaaya jaataa he
 Since in Indian law the police do not have the right to punish any accused
 lekin siries main ho rahi in ghatnaon or ucch adhikariyon kii chuppi se rajya kii kanoon vyavastha par ye sawaal uthte hai

 kin-kin maamalon main madhya pradesh kii police aropiyon ko sadak par khadaa kar peet sakati he?2
 Is the police allowed to take such action to appease the crowd or become popular? 3
 police kaa aropiyon ko sadak par peetna yaa sajaa dena, kya ek gambhir gaiyrkanoonee maamla he?4
 Despite the video being played on the National TV channel, the responsible officer of the city does not have information about the incident
 ' kya unke khilaaf jaanch honi chahie?5
 Since such incidents are happening again and again, why not assume that the government and high officials are silently supporting such action? 6
 kya madhya pradesh 'indian pinal code' kii jagah kisi or kanoon se chalata he?7
 Is the government contemplating a law in the future in which the police decide their own punishment in some cases? 8
 kuch maamalon main khud hi sajaa dekar kya madhya pradesh police court kaa samay bachaana chaahati he?9
 Should the DGP not consider it a serious matter and give the least assurance of immediate action? 10
 kya aparaadhiyon ko peetate or use maun samarthan dete ucch adhikari, 'kanoon kaa juluus' nikaalane main shariq nahin ho rahe hai?

 sardi kii subah thi
 i was standing on a crowded tiraha of Daraganj locality
 niraala bhi vahiin khadey the, murtivat
 a few lines were embossed on the marble under the statue, sorrow is the story of life
 suman bhar na liye, sakhi vasant gaya
 Do not know why, there was also a world of heart that had taken away the joy in a corner of the mind that was going through the experience of touching the affected moment
 jaise, kuch dukhad deekhne vaala ho
 After standing silent for a while and looking around, i proceeded to rip the body of the fog
 ghar or dukaanon ke saahchary main paan kii ek dukaan najar ai, jis par likhaa tha, 'niraala paan bhandar'
 Further up the street stood an attalika, adorned with stones broken by the hammer of the Guru
 jisaki deevaaron ke vaibhav ko sashtaang karti sankari gali thi or gali ke kinare bah rahe naale main keede bilabila rahe the, upar suaron kaa samooh tha
 Initially i turned left after walking some distance on the given path
 saamne ek sajjan khadey the
 i asked, in which house did Nirala live
 unhone kareeb 20 foot dur dahini disha main khadey do talle makaan kii ore ishaara kiya
 Approaching the dehri of the house, i saw that the bottom was surrounded by a wall
 makaan ke kuch hisse apane swaroop main ab bhi chhayavaadi najar aa rahe the
 a little grooming was done above
 andar daakhil hua to ek ore kii chat gaayab mili
 There was a small room on the left, painted with lime
 rasoi gir chuki thi
 The same kitchen where jackfruit dumplings made for themselves, after serving guests, were left drinking infrequent water
 makaan maalik ne rahane waalon or aagantukon ko yah abhas karaane main koi kami nahin chodi thi ki samay nirarthak he
 It was then, still is

 There was no separation
 bichombich bumadhyarekha si ek rassi tangi thi, jis par do chaddhiyaan chupchaap jhul rahi thim or chaddhiyon ko adhovastr samajhane kii purnataa ke saath do vidhyaarthee bhi khadey the
 One of them suddenly said, Nirala used to live here
 man main aayaa, kah duun, kya aapaki pahani hui or utaar kar taangi gai chaddhiyaan dekhne aayaa hum
 Every corner, roof, walls kept looking for a long time
 dekhte hue, niraala ke darjanon geeton kii panktiyaan chupchaap yaad aati gayi
 These are the days of sorrow
 
 
 
 Life continues to hurt now 
 Do not tie the boat like this sneh nirjhar bah gaya he
 i asked the students why the wall is standing outside the room
 pataa chalaa, niraala ke dehanth ke baad sahityakaron ne ghar ke us kamare ko smarak banane kii maang kii thi
 Landlord sued
 mukadmaa jeetne ke baad usne aadhunik hindi ke yashasvi kavi ke kamare par apane aadhipaty kii patharilii pataakaa gaadi
 Hindi people kept staring
 tab se ab tak wo diwaar niraala ke antim 12 varshon ke nivas se parichay karaane se pehle, is baat kaa pramaan detii he ki hindi kaa samaaj daridrata main amir he
 He is equally as impoverished for the poet, who also wrote in utter misery
 "main lakh na sakaa ve drug vipann"
 In other words of Nirala, 'the wall is surrounded by the root, people speak as they turn'
 bina kuch kahe main chupchaap baahar niklaa
 After turning around and looking carefully at that room, he took his steps forward
 gali waapas niraala paan bhandar ke paas le ai
 i thought that after taking the juice of betel it is spit out
 vaise hi niraala, paan kii tarah hamaare hindi samaaj main chabaae gaye hai
 Juice has also been taken, but not as tasty as the tasty food, which lasts for a long time

 While reading the poems of the collection, a picture of such a potential poet comes to mind which is completely settled in life

 The voice is very slow, speaks low and almost suffers from a degree of complacency
 or shaayad yahi is badbhole samay main unki kavita kii sabase badi khubsuurati he
 The first poem in the collection is a life story at the age of thirty
 yah ek berozegaar yuvak kii pidaa kii kavita he
 Note - Under the eyes, age and time have fallen, but the trust of the journey / i am still on my footsteps and vision

 There is a flood of fake poems here on girls, mother and father, but Anupam's poem girls are laughing
 Look at these lines - girls are laughing / that open arms are being spread / Payal river /

 The collection also has some of the best poems on Bengal, the sea, sand and desert

 The last league match of the IPL between Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium proved to be the most exciting match of the tournament
 naatakeey andaaj main mumbai indiens ne rajasthan royles ko 5 wicket se haraakar play of ke liye kwalifai kar liya
 In a dramatic way, Jeet Rajasthan Royals gave a huge target of 189 runs in the first play
 net ran rate ke aadhaar par play of main pahunchane ke liye jo bhi target miltaa use mumbai ko 14
 Had to be achieved in 3 overs (87 balls)
 mumbai indiens ko 87 gendon main 190 ran banane the
 Ambati Rayudu was run out off the 87th ball of Mumbai's innings
 is par match referi ne kaha ki yadi agali gend par mumbai indiens chaar ran bana leti he to vah play of main pahunch jaaegi
 Aditya Tare, who came to bat, hit a six and reached the Mumbai Indians play-off
 lekin kyon mili mumbai ko extra ball (88veen gend)darasal net ran rate (NRR) nikaalte vakt final score ko dekha jaataa he naa ki target ko
 The final score is the real number
 lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi team final score tak pahunch jaati he or uske paas target tak pahunchane ke liye agar kuch or ball shesh rahati hai to uske paas apni net ran rate ko or upar lekar jane kaa mauka rahata he
 Mumbai, who failed to make the required runs for the playoffs on the third ball of the 14th over, were ahead of Rajasthan Royals in terms of net run rate by reaching a score of 189
 is stage par mumbai kii net ran rate 0
 078099 while Rajasthan's 0
 076821 thi
 If Mumbai had taken a single on the fourth ball, they would have won but their net run rate would have been lower than Rajasthan
 rajasthan se apni net ran rate behatar karne ke liye mumbai ko extra ball par apana score 191 tak le janaa tha
 But here the twist was that two runs for Mumbai stuck at the score of 189 did not work because the target was 190 only
 ek ran lete hi use vijayi ghoshit kar diya jaataa
 In such a situation, he had the option of hitting the boundary on that extra boss
 agar vah extra ball dot bhi chali jaati tab bhi mumbai ke paas 14wein over kii paanchavin or chhathi gend par boundry jadne kaa mauka tha
 And if the last three balls of the 14th over would have gone Dot, then Mumbai would have had to hit a six off the first ball of the 15th over to get their net run rate better than Rajasthan
 agar aisa hua hota to mumbai kii net ran rate 0
 080519 and 0 of Rajasthan
 074163
 Now Mumbai will next take on Chennai Super Kings on May 28

 (navratri 2018) hindu dharm ke har tyohaar main kai reeti-rivaaj hote hai lekin aksar hamen inke peeche kaa uddeshy pataa hi nahin hota he
 In Navratri, wheat and barley are sown in an earthen vessel in front of the urn and its worship is also done
 hamamen se adhiktar logon ko pataa nahin hoga ki jau aakhir kyon bote hai?navaratri main jau bone ke peeche manyata he ki sristi kii shuruyaat main sabase pehali fasal jau kii hi thi
 Barley is also called full crop
 jau bone kaa mukhya kaaran he ki ann brahm he isliye ann kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 Navratri 2018: Navratri for the benefit of money and early marriage, this remedy is not only important to sow barley in Navratri Puja, but how fast it grows, it is also important
 nau dinon main jau kitna ug jaati he, yah hamaare bhavishya kaa bhi sanket karata he
 Navratri 2018: The rapid increase of remedy according to the zodiac sign for Navratri is considered a sign of happiness and prosperity at home
 agar jau ghani nahin ugti he yaa thik se nahin ugti he to ise ghar ke liye ashubh mana jaataa he
 It is considered auspicious if barley is of white color and directly grown
 agar jau kaale rang ke tede–medhe ugti he to ashubh mana jaataa he
 If the color of barley is yellow from the bottom and green from the top, it is believed that the beginning of the year is bad
 iske ulat agar jau kaa rang neeche se haraa or upar se pilaa ho varsh kii shuruyaat acchhee hoti he, lekin baad main pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai
 Conversely, if the color of barley is green at the bottom and yellow from the top, the beginning of the year is good, but later troubles are encountered
