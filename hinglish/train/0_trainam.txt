 Now, after getting up from the carefree life of this town, we turn to the rulers who write the date of the country

 Of truth ye to thi film kii ruparekha
 Now let's talk about its merits
 film kii kahani ke zyaadaatar baarik byore sachche or achche hai
 For example, in the opening scene, when we see Aslam working, the carcasses on his hands confirm that Adil Hussain is really deep in his character
 isi tarah paan vaale kii dukaan ke aasapaas kaa gathan ho yaa phir hamida kaa ghar or dukaan
 Apart from this, the selection and acting of the characters is also excellent, except one
 dakshin bhartiya pradhanmantri ke role main kulbhushan kharbanda jaisaa manza hua actor gale nahin utarataa
 His acting is as good as ever, but the character runs to the south and he is seen landing in the north

 Absolutely authentic

 film kaa sarprise package hai mukesh tiwari
 He has introduced his acting range in the role of Aslam's useless poet neighbor
 mukesh ko laud role milte rahe hai
 It was something different
 or umdaa bhi
 KK Raina also sharpen Khurrat Dixit's shameless infatuation
 film ke samvaad sukunbaksh hai
 Gives a new crop of cinema's new land
 jed plus dekhne ke dauraan aapako nai kism kii bhashaa, muhaavaron or kahan kaa parichay milegaa
 The sharpness of dialogues in a film with political satire is also necessary
 bina zyada prakat hue
 The film succeeds in that too and Rajkumar Singh and Chandraprakash Dwivedi deserve congratulations for this
 masalan, jab hamida kahati he ki neend bechakar bistar nahin kharida jaataa he
 Or in one place, Aslam tells the officer with complete innocence, does the Prime Minister also make a mistake
 ab baat kamajoriyon kii
 The film's story initially arouses hope
 lagata he ki ek kasbe or ek kirdaar kii kahani janpath se rajpath tak ke safar main kai ganthen kholegi
 Like Peepli Live
 magar aakhir main isamen jhol hi jhol najar aane lagate hai
 Be it the film's climax or leaving many of the episodes unfinished
 yaa phir gaanon yaa prakarnon ko turat phurat spark paidaa karne ke liye thuns dena
 Aslam and Habib were once friends
 phir dushman ho gaye
 Finally friend again
 magar rakeeb kyon bane, ye bataane kii jarurat nahin samajhi gai
 Similarly, Sanjay Mishra has been kept in the role of border bandit so that another quota of comedy can be fulfilled
 unka kirdaar bharwaan sa laga
 The songs of the film were also put to fulfill the demand of the film
 haalanki raahat bas itani he ki ye kahin bhi film kii gati rokte hue bich main nahin aate

 The film Jade Place is a must see for those who like some different films
 eemaandaar dhang se halaat dikhaati filmein pasand hai
 Those who like to see the real characters and their contradictions on the screen

 Yet when the book of historical success is written, it is expected that these people will be recorded in the footnotes
 footnots matlab kitaab ke pannon ke sabase neeche likhi choti choti jaankariyaan
 Those deposited outside the Reserve Bank know when the deadline for exchange of old notes has expired
 phir bhi har rose yahaan kai log jamaa ho jate hai
 Looks towards the Reserve Bank as if looking at God
 ab prabhu kii krupa hogi or tab unke 500 or 1000 ke raddi ho chuke note sona ban jaaenge
 These people have been evicted from the media coverage even before the great success of Uttar Pradesh
 zaruri he ki inhen bhi parajeet ghoshit kar diya jaae magar ye log hai ki haar maanane kaa naam hi nahin le rahe
 Many know that only NRI notes will be exchanged by 31 March
 enarai yaa videshon main rahane vaale logon ko bhi pareshaaniyaan ho rahi hai
 Many of them are not exchanging notes for different reasons
 magar ham or aap sarkaar se ant ant tak ummid lagaae rahete hai ki kya pataa use raham aa jaae
 Does anyone know that his heart gets sweaty and invites all the people standing outside and tell him that your notes are being changed
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke baahar ye log janvari main aate rahe, farvari main aate rahe or march main aate rahe
 Everyone gave the last chance to the Reserve Bank to know whether the address that the holder pledged to pay should be upheld by his promise
 unki kamai barbaad hone se batch jaae
 What a mistake Master Rajasthan is
 har kisi kaa dhan kaala dhan nahin he
 The color of hard-earned money has also gone bad

 In the hope that the government has a big heart

 On March 23, when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha raised the exemption limit for donations to political parties, it made arrangements that now if a corporate donates, it will not tell in its books who has donated
 us vakt congress ke anand sharma ne kaha ki unki party ko chanda nahin mil rahaa he
 Then the Finance Minister had said that the government needs a big heart for what it has done
 shaayad isliye rigerv bank ke baahar jamaa logon ko sarkaar se ummid he
 They know that the government has taken the final decision, yet why should anyone leave hope till the last moment
 media ne bhi in logon ko bhula diya or upi haarane ke baad vipaksh ne notebandi ke kisi bhi masale se tauba hi kar liya he
 The stories of these people are also buried with old notes amidst the celebration and desperation of any great success
 hamane sochaa dafan hone se pehle kafan uthaakar dekh lete hai, jo log apane puraane note ko haath main lekar ro rahe the, wo koun hai
 How can someone be punished for forgetting at age 90? haryana ke mevaat kii ek budhi mahila ko achaanak yaad aayaa ki 23000 kahin rakhe gaye hai
 The sarpanch of Punhana village has typed an affidavit in English that Mrs
 Jumrat is a resident of Otha village
 90 saal kii vruddh mahila hai
 It is certified that on March 24, while cleaning the house, he received Rs 23,000 of old currency
 ye bhi pramanit kiya jaataa he ki ukt mahila kaaphi garib he
 His and his family's character is quite good
 isliye aapse guzarish he ki unke puraane note badal jaaen
 The sarpanch's name is written as Noman Ahmed
 kisi ne sochaa hoga ki rigerv bank ko angrezi hi aati hogi to angrezi main pramaan patr de diya
 You cannot understand the extent of expectation from the government and its institutions
 sarkaar ke manaa karne par bhi logon ko aas rahati he ki wo ek baar haa kah degi
 The comments 8 november ko pradhanmantri ne notebandi kaa elaan kiya tha
 It was said that by March 31, old notes can be replaced
 28 disambar ko sarkaar adhyadesh laati he ki 31 march kii jagah 31 disambar ke baad puraane note nahin badale ja sakenge
 During that time the announcements were changed several times
 adhyadesh main kaha gaya ki 31 disambar ke baad se 500 or ek hazaar ke saare puraane note bhartiya rigerv bank kii javabdehi nahin rahenge
 Within a certain time, the five headquarters of the Reserve Bank were allowed to deposit with certain conditions
 bhartiya yaa enarai 9 november se 30 disambar ke bich baahar the to ve puraane note badal sakate hai
 Old notes were exchanged at the Reserve Bank of India offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Nagpur
 enarai ko 30 june tak note badalane kii suvidha di gai he
 Permission was granted to keep ten to twenty-five old notes for research or collection
 usase zyada rakhane par das hazaar kaa jurmaana lagegaa yaa us paise kaa paanch guna jurmaana lagegaa
 After the government's ordinance, people reached the court with a variety of petitions
 abhi tak faisla nahin aayaa he
 Hearing is going on
 7 march or 21 march ko sunwaayee hui he
 The Supreme Court gave two weeks time to the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India to file their reply
 note badalane ke niyam sarkaar ke hisaab se saral honge magar aam aadmi jab bank ke manager ke saamne khadaa hota he to wo unhen maai baap samajhane lagata he
 It is not so easy for him to understand all the information
 bahuton ko pataa he ki 31 march tak sirf enarai ke note badale jaaenge
 nris or people living abroad are also having problems
 unamem se bhi kaiyon ke alag alag kaarnon se note nahin badale ja rahe hai
 But we and you keep hoping from the government till the end that what is known to him is kind
 kya pataa uskaa dil pasij jaae or baahar khadey sabhi logon ko bheetar bula le or kah de ki aapke note badale ja rahe hai
 Outside the Reserve Bank of India, these people kept coming in January, coming in February and coming in March
 sabane rigerv bank ko aakiri mauka diya ki kya pataa jo dharak ko adaa karne kaa vachan detaa he wo apane vachan par kaayam rahe
 Their earnings are saved from ruin
 rajasthan ke master ji kya galati he
 Everyone's wealth is not black money
 mehnat kii kamai kaa rang bhi badnaam ho gaya
 Those who had scam money, they are still being held in Karnataka and Mumbai, who have sweat money, they are standing in front of the Reserve Bank and pleading
 is ummid main ki sarkaar kaa dil bada he
 She will have mercy
 23 march ko jab rajyasabha main vitt mantri arun jetali ne raajnneetik dalon ke chande ke liye chhot kii seemaa badha di, ye intazaam kar diya ki ab koi karporate chanda degaa to apane bahikhaate main nahin bataayegaa ki kise chanda diya he
 At that time, Anand Sharma of Congress said that his party was not receiving donations
 tab vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ne jo kiya he uske liye bada dil chahie
 Perhaps that is why people deposited outside the Reserve Bank have expectations from the government
 unhen pataa he ki sarkaar ne antim faisla le liya he phir bhi antim vakt tak ummid kyon chode koi
 The media has also forgotten these people and after losing UP, the opposition has avoided any issue of demonetisation
 kisi bhi badi kamyaabi ke jashn or hataasha ke bich in logon kii kahaniyaan bhi puraane noton ke saath dafan ho rahi hai
 We thought, before burial, we pick up the shroud and see who are the people who were crying with their old notes in hand
 90 saal kii umr main kisi ko bhuulane kii sazaa kaise di ja sakati he
 An old woman from Mewat in Haryana suddenly remembered that 23000 had been placed somewhere
 punhana gaanv ke sarpanch ne angrezi main ek halafanama tip karke diya he ki shrimati jumrat otha gaanv kii nivasee hai
 She is a 90 year old woman

 It is also certified that the said woman is very poor
 inkaa or inke parivaar kaa charitra kaaphi acha he
 Therefore, you are requested to change their old notes
 sarpanch kaa naam noman ahamed likhaa he
 Someone would have thought that the Reserve Bank would have known English, then gave the certificate in English
 sarkaar or uski sansthaaon se logon kii ummid kii seemaa aap nahin samaj sakate
 Even after the government refuses, people are hopeful that they will say yes once
 tippaniyan The demonetisation was announced by the Prime Minister on 8 November
 kaha tha ki 31 march tak puraane note badale ja sakenge
 On 28 December, the government brings an ordinance that the old notes will not be replaced after 31 December instead of 31 March
 us dauraan kai baar ghoshnaaon ko badla gaya
 The ordinance stated that since December 31, all old notes of 500 and one thousand rupees will no longer be the responsibility of the Reserve Bank of India
 ek niyat samay main rigerv bank ke paanch mukhyalayon main kuch sharton ke saath jamaa karne kii chhot di gai
 If Indian or NRI were out between 9 November to 30 December, they can replace old notes
 mumbai, dilli, kolkata, chennai or nagpur ke bhartiya rigerv bank ke daftar main puraane note badale jaan the
 nris are allowed to exchange notes by 30 June
 research yaa sangrah ke liye das se pachis puraane note hi rakhane kii ijazat di gai
 Keeping more than that will attract a fine of ten thousand or a fine of five times that money
 sarkaar ke adhyadesh ke baad kai tarah kii yachikaayen lekar log adaalat pahunch gaye
 The decision has not come yet
 sunwaayee hi ho rahi he
 The hearing took place on March 7 and 21
 supreme court ne bhartiya rigerv bank or bharat sarkaar ko do hafte kaa samay diya ki ve apana jawaab daakhil karen
 The rules for changing notes will be simple according to the government, but when the common man stands in front of the manager of the bank, he starts thinking of them as my father
 uske liye sari soochnaaon ko samajhnaa itnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 What a mistake Master Rajasthan is

 According to Sumit Arora that night he was going to his house after finishing shooting
 dahisar check naakaa ke paas gaadiyaan bahut hi dhimi gati se reng rahi thim
 Then a person started knocking the mirror on the left side of the car
 tippaniyan According to Sumit, as soon as he turned the glass down, the man shouted why the car hit me
 abhi wo use jawaab de pate tabhi ek duusare shaks ne duusari taraf ke shishe ko peetna shuru kar diya
 Sumit wanted to talk down with the other glass too, so he left
 sumit kuch samaj hi nahin paye, palat kar pehle kii taraf dekha to wo bhi ja chukaa tha
 Just then Sumit noticed that his mobile phone and wallet kept on the side have disappeared

 Police say that people should not get caught by such thugs

 mumbai main spark gang hi nahin kai thak-thak gang bhi sakriy hai
 The mobile phone and pocket of actor Sumit Arora, playing the character of Gomukh, a similar gang zoo serial, were taken away in such a cool manner that they are still surprised how this happened
 sumit arora ke mutabik us raat wo shooting khatm kar apane ghar ja rahe the
 Trains were crawling very slowly near Dahisar Czech Naka
 tabhi car kii baayin taraf ke shishe ko ek shaks ne thak-thakaana shuru kiya
 The comments sumit ke mutabik jaise hi unhone sheesha neeche kiya wo shaks chillane laga ki car mere par kyon chadha di
 Right now he was able to answer him, then another person started beating the mirror on the other side
 sumit ne doosraa sheesha bhi neeche kar usase baat karnaa chaha to wo chalaa gaya
 Sumit could not understand anything, when he turned back and looked at him, he had also gone
 tabhi sumit kaa dhyaan gaya ki bagal main rakhaa unka mobile phone or batua gaayab ho chukaa he
 Sumit is still wondering how this happened? In Mumbai, sometimes spark gangs and sometimes gangs keep hunting car drivers
 police kahati he ki log aise thagon ke jhaanse main na aaen
 But people say that the police do not take their complaints seriously
 isliye aksar log thage jane ke baad bhi shikaayatein karne se bachate hai jiskaa phayda thag giroh uthaate hai

 com / r1amrvtclj— Sony TV (@sonytv)may 4, 2019sho ke dauraan nina ne bataaya ki kuch samay pehle unhone soshal media par kaam maangane ko lekar ek post kiya tha
 She was nervous about how her daughter Masaba would react to it
 unhone aage bataaya ki is dauraan beti ne unka khub saport kiya
 Significantly, in the film Badhaai Ho, Gajraj and Nina played the role of husband and wife
 ayushmaan khurana ne donon ke bete kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 In the film, Sanya Malhotra was seen as Ayushmann's Love Interst
 ahir ne bataaya ki jaanch ke dauraan desh ke vibhinn ilaakon main 1,000 se adhik gavaahon se poochtacha kii gai he
 Denying the charge of delaying the investigation, Ahir said that apart from being very old and in poor condition the records related to these cases are being translated into Urdu language
 unhone kaha ki shikayatakartaaon or gavaahon kii pahchaan main kathinaayee ke kaaran jaanch lambit he
 He said that the progress of the work of the Home Ministry SIT is being regularly monitored
 tippaniyan (from input language) (input bhashaa se) (from input language) kaam or padhai kii vajah se aksar hi log ghar se baahar nikalakar duusare shahar jate hai
 Where you have to do everything on your own and to stay with it, one has to share in PG, hostel or even room
 ghar se dur rahane par rummet hi aapkaa ekmaatr sahaara banataa he jo aapke saath ek hi ghar main rahata he or anjaan shahar main sabase kareebi ban jaataa he
 In such a situation, it is also very important to know how your roommate is or how it is because sharing comes with a lot of responsibilities
 agar aap kaa ruumamerchha or samajhadaar haito aapke liye ghar se baahar rahanaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 If you also share a room, then know what your roommate is like
 
 
 1
 If your roommate does not disturb you unnecessarily and takes full care of your privacy, then you can make yourself feel lucky
 kyonki jab aap kisi ke saath ghar share karte hai to bahut saare samjhaute karne hi padate hai
 If your roommate is very good in nature then you should also treat him in the same way so that your relationship can be strengthened
 2
 Due to the separation of office time or due to the separation of college, your roommate is not able to give you time and because of this, he is unhappy, then he is really the best roommate for you
 ek hi room main rahakar bhi agar vah aapakipsand-naapsand ko enjoy karte hanto aapako bhi unka puraa khyaal rakhana chahie
 3
 jab aapke rummet kahin chale jate hai yaa phir chhutityon main jab vah apane ghar chale jate hai to aap use miss karne lagate hai
 This happens only when both of you have good bowling
 4
 If the two of you share each other's vodobes freely, that too without bringing any ego in between, then it is a sign that there is a perfect tuning between you
 5
 Whenever you both have nothing to do, your roommate fills your boring day with fun and fun
 aise insaan ke saath room share karnaa aapke liye plus point he kyonki aap ek fan luving person ke saath rahete hai
 6
 agar aapkaa rummet bahes karne kii bajaay baat ko khatm karke shanti ke saath sab kuch thik kar detaa he to yah rishta ek behtareendosti main badalane kaa ishaara bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, you should also stick with him
 pakistan ne somvaar ko kartarpur galiyara (kartarpur corridor) samjhaute kaa masauda bharat ke saath saajha kiya he
 Pakistan has also invited the Indian team to come to Islamabad to finalize the draft
 bataa den ki prastaavit masaude (kartarpur corridor) ke tahat bhartiya sikh tirth yatriyon ko narowal sthit darbar sahib kartarpur gurudwara jane kii suvidha di jaaegi
 This gurudwara is located in Pakistan, about four kilometers from Gurdaspur (kartarpur corridor) on the Indian border
 pakistan ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa mohammad faisal ne ek bayaan main kaha ki islamabad sthit bhartiya ucchayog ke madhyam se prastaav kaa masauda bharat ko saunpa gaya he
 Significantly, after the statement of the Foreign Minister of the Government of Pakistan last year, the two governments stood face to face
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj (sushma Swaraj) ne pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi dwaara kartarpur galiyare (kartarpur corridor) ko lekar die bayaan par kadaa aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Sushma Swaraj had said that such a statement is like insulting the Sikhs
 swaraj (sushma Swaraj) ne twit kar kaha tha ki shriman pakistan ke videsh mantri aapke dwaara kahi gai gugali vaali baat aapaki manshaa ko puri tarah se logon ke saamne rakh rahi he
 It also shows that your government does not care about the sentiments of the Sikhs
 unhone aage kaha tha ki main aapako bataanaa chaahati hum ki ham aapaki gugali main nahin fanse hai
 Our two ministers went to Kartarpur Saheb only so that they could pray in this holy gurudwara
 bataa den ki pakistan ke videsh mantri mahmud kuraishi ne kuch din pehle kartarpur galiyare aane ko lekar bharat sarkaar ko die nimantran par kah tha ki aitihaasik kartarpur galiyare ke shilanyas kaarykram main bharat sarkaar kii maujuudagi sunishchit karne ke liye pradhanmantri imran khan ne ek 'gugali' phenki, jisaki vajah se bharat kii narendra modi sarkaar ne do mantriyon ko kaarykram main shirkat ke liye bheja
 Qureshi's remarks came on a statement made by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj a day earlier, in which she explicitly rejected the possibility of resuming bilateral talks with Pakistan, saying that Pakistan would not be able to - Do not stop cross-border terrorist activities, negotiation is not possible
 pakistan ne isse pehle buudhvaar ke kaarykram main sushamaa swaraj ko bhi aamantrit kiya tha, lekin swaraj ne purv patibaddhtaon kaa hawala dete hue kartarpur sahib aane main asamarthta jataai thi

 satya ko narayan ke rup main poojana hi satyanarayan kii puja he
 The second meaning of this is that the only Narayan in the world is the truth, the rest is Maya
 satya main hi sara jagat samaaya hua he
 With the help of truth, the rest of the Lord holds the earth
 srisatyanarayan vrath kaa varnan devarshi naarad ji ke poochne par swayan bhagwaan vishnu ne apane mukh se kiya he
 Story of Sri Sathyanarayana Vrat: Once Yogi Narada ji visited the mortals of the land of death and were troubled by various miseries according to their deeds
 isse unka santahruday dravit ho uthaa or ve veena bajaate hue apane param aradhy bhagwaan srihari kii sharan main hari kirthan karte kshirsagar pahunch gayi or stutipurvak bole, ‘he nath! yadi aap mere upar prasann hai to mrityulok ke praaniyon kii vyathaa harne vaala koi chota-sa upaay bataane kii krupa karen
 'then God said,' o Watts! You have raised a very beautiful question about the spirit of world welfare
 at: tumhen sadhuwaad he
 Today i tell you a fast that is rare even in heaven and is very virtuous and is going to cut off the bond of attachment and that is Sreesathyanarayana fast
 ise vidhi-vidhaan se karne par manushya sansaarik sukhon ko bhogakar paralok main moksh praapt kar letaa he
 After this, upon seeing a poor Brahmin of Kashipur city doing begging, Lord Vishnu himself goes to that poor Brahmin as an old Brahmin and says, 'O Vipra! Lord Satyanarayana is going to give desired results to God
 tum unke vrath-pujan karo jise karne se munashya sab prakaar ke dukhon se mukt ho jaataa he
 Fasting also has its own importance in this fast, but not taking food only by fasting should be understood
 upwas ke samay hriday main yah dharna honi chahie ki aaj shri satyanarayan bhagwaan hamaare paas hi virajman hai
 Therefore, the inside and outside should be maintained cleanly and worshiping God with devotion and faith should listen to their Mangalamayi story
 ’ siankal main yah vrath-pujan adhik prashast mana jaataa he
 The story of Shri Satyanarayana tells that mankind has equal rights in fasting
 chaahe vah nirdhan, dhanwaan, raja ho yaa vyavsaayee, brahman ho yaa anya varg, stri ho yaa purush
 To illustrate this, the story consists of the legend of poor Brahmin, poor woodcutter, king Ulkamukh, wealthy businessman, monk Vaishya, his wife Lilavati, daughter Kalavati, king Tungadhvaja and Gopganas
 kathasaar grahan karne se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jis kisi ne satya ke prati shraddha-vishwaas kiya, un sabake kaary siddh ho gayi
 Just as the woodcutter, poor Brahmin, Ulkamukh, gopagnas heard that this fast is going to give happiness, good fortune, child, wealth and everything, then on hearing it started to conduct Satyavrat with reverence, devotion and love and consequently enjoy spiritual happiness in the world
 He became the official of salvation
 sadhu vaisya ne bhi yahi prasang raja ulkamukh se vidhi-vidhaan ke saath suna, kintu uskaa vishwaas adhuraa tha
 There was a lack of reverence
 vah kahata tha ki santan prapti par satyavrath-pujan karuunga
 As time passed, a beautiful girl was born in his house
 uski shraddhalu patni ne vrath kii yaad dilaayi to usne kaha ki kanya ke vivaah ke samay karenge
 When the time came, the girl also got married, but that Vaishya did not fast
 vah apane damaad ko lekar vyapaar ke liye chalaa gaya
 He was imprisoned by Raja Chandraketu along with son-in-law on charges of theft
 peeche ghar main bhi chori ho gayi
 Wife Lilavati and daughter Kalavati became compelled to beggar
 ek din kalavati ne kisi wipro ke ghar shri satyanarayan kaa pujan hote dekha or ghar aakar maa ko bataaya
 Then the mother fasted the next day with reverence and asked God to bless her husband and son-in-law soon
 srihari prasann ho gayi or swapn main raja ko donon bandiyon ko chhodie kaa aadesh diya
 The king sent them away by giving them money and abundant wealth
 ghar aakar poornima or sankranti ko satyavrath kaa jivan paryant aayojan karata rahaa, falat: sansaarik sukh bhogakar use moksh praapt hua
 Similarly, King Tughdhwaj saw the gopagas worshiping Lord Sri Satyanarayana in the forest, but the Chur king neither went to the place of worship nor worshiped from afar nor received the offerings given by the gopanas
 parinaam yah hua ki raja ke putr, dhan-dhaany, ashv-gajadi sab nasht ho gayi
 The king suddenly realized that the cause of the disaster was Satyadev's disrespect to God
 use bahut pashchaatap hua
 He immediately went to the forest
 gopaganon ko bulaakar kaaphi samay lagaakar satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puja kii
 Then he received the prasad from them and came home
 usne dekha ki vipatti tal gayi or uski sari sampatti tathaa jan surakshit ho gayi
 The king was filled with happiness and was abolished in the conduct of Satyavrat and surrendered himself to God
 shri satyanarayan vrath se hamen shiksha milti he ki satyarup brahm jeevatma rup main hamaare andar vidyaman he
 We are all the forms of truth, but thinking of collecting the things which come under the control of Maya, they are engrossed in the world
 is agyaan ko dur karke satya ko sweekaar karnaa or prabhu kii bhakthi karnaa hi maanav kaa dharm he
 This is the essence of Satyanarayana fast and story

" uttarakhand main bahut badi prakritik aapadaa ai he or sabko milakar usase nipatna he

 australia ke tej gendbaaj mishael stark ne duusare test main bharat par australia kii 146 ranon kii jeet ke baad optus stadium kii pich ko isisi kii ‘ausat’ reating milane par niraashaa jataai he
 Some batsmen in Perth were hit while playing, especially in the second innings
 stark ne kaha ki yah acha aakraamak test cricket tha or is tarah kii reating ise puri tarah se ballebaajon kaa khel bana degi
 Stark said before the Boxing Day Test, "it is a bit disappointing as a cricket fan that the Perth pitch was given an average rating
" mujhe lagata he ki yah gend or balle ke bich shandaar jang thi jo test cricket main aap dekhnaa chaahate hai
 'he said,' For example, playing in the MCG last year was pretty dull and the pitch did nothing
 aap gend or balle ke bich muqabla chaahate hai, jo test cricket ko jivit rakhega or perth kii tarah logon ko maidan main khinchakar laaegaa
 There was a great struggle and i think that was a great pitch
 ’ stark ne kaha, ‘daraaron ne apni bhoomika nibhaai, lekin jab chauthe or paanchaven din pich tuutati he, to aisa hota he
 If you always prepare a flat pitch, cricket will become a batsman's game
 aap gend or balle ke bich romaanchak muqabla chaahate hai
 "he said," This is the game when the ball is moving and the batsmen have to play
 marcus haris ne gend lagane ke baavjood khelnaa jari rakhaa or donon tiimon ke ballebaajon ke kandhon par gend lagi, lekin unhone khelnaa jari rakh
 It was good aggressive cricket and it draws people to the game
 ’ edilade test ke dauraan stark ke sust hone ke liye aalochana kii gai thi, lekin donon do test main 10 wicket chatkaakar aalochakon ko karaara jawaab diya
 ALSO READ- IND vs AUS: Michael Vaughan also raged on the Perth pitch average rating, saying that the Australian attack is making a joint effort to take quick wickets against India and the Indian openers are definitely in poor form
 Has helped unhone kaha, ‘yah hamaari yojana he, ham jaldi wicket hasil karnaa chaahate hai or madhya kram ko nai gend ke saath gendbaaji karnaa chaahate hai
 We still have this plan
 ham dekhenge ki ve sheersh kram main badlaav karte hai yaa nahin
 We still have this plan - try to put them under as much pressure as possible and bowl the middle order as soon as possible
 ’baayen haath kaa yah tej gendbaaj haalanki bharat ke salaami ballebaajon murali vijay or lokesh rahul ko agar dobaaraa mauka miltaa he to unhen halke main nahin khelnaa chahta
 Stark's fast bowling partner Pat Cummins said when bowling to Virat Kohli in Perth, that when you bowl the world's best batsman, there is not much chance of a mistake

 Amit Shah has taken over the chair of BJP President
 aise main unke bare main logon kii jigyaasa badhati hi ja rahi he
 Know who is Amit Shah 
 
 darasal, amit shah modi management ke sabase bade guru hai
 This has rarely happened in the politics of Gujarat, when the son of a businessman has achieved the fame of being an expert in political politics
 vyapaaree anilchandra shah ke yahaan janme amit shah ab bijepi ke senapati ban chuke hai
 The life of BJP General Secretary Amit Shah revolves around three words - Modi, Encounter and UP
 lekin unke kareebi log bataate hai ki chunautiyon or avasaron ko pahchaanane main shah kaa jawaab nahin he
 Branch, Stock and Politics
 
 
 science snaatak college main chaatr netaa rahe amit shah sangh kii shakhaon main bachapan se hi jaaya karte the or raajnneeti main aane se pehle ek stock brokar the
 Amit Shah, a stockbroker and member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, can now take the 'stock' of anyone in the BJP up and show anyone the way out of the political race
 shah ke kareebi kehete hai ki unhone dhirubhai ambani or anya dhani vyapaariyon se prerit hokar plastic kaa dhandha shuru kiya tha, lekin jald hi unhen lagane laga ki bina sarkari madad ke koi bhi bada udyog khadaa karnaa mushkil he
 a senior Sangh pracharak introduced 26-year-old Amit Shah to 41-year-old Narendra Modi, who had made inroads into the Sangh and BJP by then
 modi un dinon apni team bana rahe the or unhen amit shah ke aatmavishvaas ne kaaphi prabhavit kiya
 Amit Shah expressed his desire for Modi to handle the campaign of LK Advani
 shah ne kaha ki unke pita mansa, jo gandhinagar loksabhaa kshatra main aata he, ke ek pratishthit vyapaaree rahe hai or vah gandhinagar ke raajnneetik samikarnon se acchhee tarah waakif hai
 Shah made a good mark in the party after Advani's election
 bijepi or gujarat kii raajnneeti ko kareeb se dekhne vaale kai log modi or shah ke rishte ko 1980 or 1990 main adwani or modi ke rishte jaisaa bataate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why Modi got a glimpse of his youthful passion in Shah and made him an integral ally
 saal 2001 main jab keshubhai patel ko hataakar modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane, to usase pehle hi unhone amit shah ko ek kaddavar netaa bana diya tha
 Shah was made the chairman of the Gujarat State Financial Corporation in 1995
 is pad par rahete hue wo kuch khaas asar nahin dikhaa paae, lekin yahaan rahete hue unki najar gujarat ke ko-oparative bank sector par padi
 In just a few days he became the head of the Ahmedabad District Co-operative Bank
 shah hai modi ke aankh-kaanaunheen dinon gujarat main modi kaa badhata virodh dekhakar party ne unhen dilli bula liya
 But while in Gujarat, Shah remained Modi's eye and kept on giving him the news of Gujarat's politics
 shah ne is dauraan gujarat ke ko-oparative bank or mandaliyon par, jis par varshon se congress kaa kabja tha, apni pakad majboot kerani shuru kar di
 In 2002, when the BJP was re-formed under the leadership of Narendra Modi, Shah, the youngest in the government, was made the Minister of State for Home, in view of his ability, understanding and loyalty
 shah ko sabase adhik das mantralay die gaye or unhen darjanon cabinet samitiyon kaa sadsy banaaya gaya
 It was discussed in those days that these kind of favors were done on Shah as a reward for helping to remove Keshubhai
 saal 2002 main amit shah ko party ne sarkhez vidhansabha se tikat diya
 He won the election by a record one lakh 60 thousand votes
 yah jeet narendra modi kii chunavi jeet se bhi badi thi
 In 2007, this figure reached 2 lakh 35 thousand
 modi amit shah ke chunavi daanv-pech ke prashansak ban gaye the
 Amit Shah soon emerged as the largest leader in the Modi cabinet
 phir kya tha
 
 
 On the lines of 'jo Hukum Mere Aaka', Shah used to carry out every intention of Modi
 chaahe gujarat kii ko-oparative mandali ho yaa sarkari-nijee kshetra ke karmchaariyon kii union, shah ne bijepi kaa jhanda har jagah laharaaya
 Shah had become Modi's armor, and whether it was a police officer or a leader of the opposition or an anti-modi in the Gujarat BJP, Shah forced everyone to obey Modi's orders
 modi maanate the ki jab tak police or sarkari adhikari unke saath nahin honge, ve rajya main lambey samay tak tik nahin paaenge
 In the political corridors, it is said that micro management like Shah and the ability of booth management during elections are few
 ek baar modi ne shah se gujarat cricket association main congress kii pakad ke bare main chintaa jataai
 What was then, Shah gave the president the post of president in 2009 as a birthday present to Modi and himself became the vice-president
 haalanki shah or modi ke association main aane se cricket kaa maahaul bighad-sa gaya or rajya kaa ek bhi nayaa khilaadi team india main apni jagah nahin bana paaya
 However, during Shah's stay outside Gujarat, his son Jai continues to make inroads within and outside the party
 jai haal hi main gujarat cricket association ke general secretary bane hai or team ke chunaav main behad dilchaspee rakhte hai, jisase varisht khilaadi khaase naaraaz hai
 There are many similarities in the lives of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi
 donon ne aresas kii shakhaon main janaa bachapan se shuru kar diya tha or donon ne apni javaani main apane josh or kushalta se varisht netaaon ko prabhavit kiya tha
 However, the biggest political turn in the lives of Shah and Modi came when they were driven out of Gujarat
 jahaan modi ko gujarat main unke khilaaf badhate virodh ke chalate nikaala gaya, vahiin, shah ko soharabuddin shaikh farji encounter cese main aarope lagane ke baad court ke aadesh par tadeepaar kiya gaya
 Amit Shah is currently on bail in that case
 isi maamle main pakade gaye gujarat ke darjanon police adhikari jail main hai
 When Shah was expelled from Gujarat, he camped at the Gujarat Bhavan in Delhi
 yahaan rahete hue ve bijepi ke bade netaaon ke kareeb aate gaye or modi ke liye dilli aane ke raste banaate gaye
 When BJP was planning its strategy for elections, Modi and Shah knew that it is impossible to get a Delhi chair without winning UP
 tab shah upi janaa nahin chaahate the, par gujarat main anandiben patel or anya khemon kii gujarat bijepi main badhati pakad dekh unhone yah chunauti sweekaar kar lee
 However, Shah became a state leader from a state leader to a national leader as soon as the party took charge of UP

 He said that he was the senior-most among the shortlisted bureaucrats and the only person to serve as the chief secretary
 iske alaava sivisi ke pad ke liye unke naam par vichaar kiye jane ke maamle main unhen kendriya satarkta ayog se manjuuri mil chuki thi kyonki pamolin aayaat maamle main unke khilaaf abhiyojan ko anumati nahin di gai thi
 Thomas said that the question regarding the distribution of documents related to the corruption case to the committee headed by the Prime Minister has no relevance in the background of the selection process to be adopted for the appointment of CVC
 unhone ucchtam nyaayalay main daakhil halafname main yah bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri ke netritv vaali teen sadasyeey samiti ke samaksh rakhe gaye dastavejon kii jaanch is tathy kii roshni main praasangik nahin hogi ki pad ke liye chhante gaye sabhi naam sarkaar ke sachivon ke the
 The honesty of the secretaries cannot be doubted due to the process of their selection
 test se mahendra singh dhoni ke sanyas ke saath hi bhartiya cricket kaa ek daur biit gaya
 a period in which Mahendra Singh Dhoni ran the Indian team on his own choice
 bhartiya cricket main is dauraan koi khilaadi unke kad ke aasapaas nahin najar aayaa
 He also got a lot of success
 kamyaabi ke saaye main unki naakaamiyaan bhi chhupati raheen
 Now that he has retired from the Test, do you remember any of his failures? ek najar paanch un maukon par, jahaan par dhoni ek captain ke taur par na keval naakaam hue, balki unka khud kaa kad bhi kamatar hua
 Not available for 1-players mahendra singh dhoni ne captain ke taur par bhale karishmai kamyaabi hasil kii ho, lekin team ke saathi khilaadiyon ke saath unke sambandh bahut madhur nahin the
 They are also not available to their partner
 iskaa khulaasa tab hua jab vivies lakshmana ne apane sanyas kii ghoshnaa kii
 VVS Laxman, who played a long-term match-winner for India, did not succeed despite repeated attempts when he tried to contact Dhoni on the issue of retiring from Test cricket
 tab vivies lakshmana ne kaha tha, main dhoni se sampark nahin kar sakaa, ve biji aadmi hai
 Dhoni said on this issue, it is always difficult to contact me
 maine sudharne kii koshish kii, lekin ye sambhav nahin ho paaya
 Even at the wedding of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, only Suresh Raina was seen from Team India
 2-sahvaag, sachin par sawaal Dhoni was under criticism after his 0–4 loss to Australia in 2008
 team vanade series main bhi ummid ke mutabik nahin khel paa rahi thi
 In such a situation, Dhoni divided the team into two groups by targeting senior players in the press conference
 unhone sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir kii fielding par sawaal uthaate hue unhen slo fielder kaha
 Questions were raised about Dhoni's criticism about Sachin and Sehwag, and Sehwag took a better catch, making up his mind to answer in the field itself, but there was a rift in the team, Sehwag also said that if Dhoni wants to give him a break, So he is the captain, he can do that
 us daur main team india main gutbaji or tanaav kii khabaren charam par thim, lekin isaki shuruyaat team ke captain dhoni ne hi kii thi
 3-media conflict team india ke captain ke taur par mahendra singh dhoni ke media ke saath rishte hameshaa tanatani vaale rahe
 In order to respond to the news of factionalism in the team, he pitched the entire Team India in the press conference during the 2009 T20 World Cup
 2013 main jab ipel main sattebaazi or phixing kaa vivaad gaharaaya to dhoni ne is vivaad par media main chuppi saadh lee
 Even in his last Test series, he himself first spoke of tension between Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan and then took a dig at the media on this aspect
 4-sattebaazi main uchhla naam? Mahendra Singh Dhoni's name also sprang up in the IPL season 6 betting and spot fixing
 chaahe unki patni sakshi ravat kii vindu daara singh ke saath tasviir rahi ho yaa phir gurunath mayyapan ke saath dhoni kii nazdikiyaan
 All this brought Dhoni under suspicion
 ek hi vakt main bhartiya cricket team ke captain or en shrinivasana kii company main naukari ko lekar kanflict of interest kaa maamla bhi garmaya
 Not only this, Dhoni was criticized for being the captain of Team India and for running his own sports management company
 is mangement company se jude kai khilaadi dhoni kii captaini main team india kii ore se khel rahe the
 5-craving victory on foreign pitch mahendra singh dhoni bhartiya cricket ke sabase kaamyaab test captain bhale hon, lekin unki captaini main team india kaa pradarshan videshi pichon par bahut acha nahin rahaa
 Under his captaincy, Team India captained 30 Tests at foreign grounds and the team lost 15 Tests in it
 khaskar australian or england ke maidaanon par dhoni kii captaini niraash karne vaali rahi
 As the captain of Team India, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will remember his failures when it comes to success

 emsidi chunaav se pehle rigerveshan ke masale par dilli hoicourt ne sabhi yachikaayen khaarij kar di
 The Delhi Election Commission was awaiting the High Court's decision before issuing election notification
 darasal kai parshadon ne anusuchit jati ke ummidavaaron ke liye rajya chunaav ayog ke formule ko hoicourt main chunauti di thi
 The contention of these councilors was that the formula to reserve seats for Dalit candidates for the next election after the MCD split is wrong
 unke mutabiq dilli chunaav ayog ne saal 2001 kii janaganana ke aadhaar par emsidi siton kaa aarakshan kar diya he jabaki pichley das saal main un siton kaa jatigat sameekaran badal chukaa he
 As soon as the Prime Minister said this at the Ricoh Collegium stage in Toronto, the crowd of Indians who were there was filled with enthusiasm
 pradhanmantri ne jitani pramukhataa se is baat ko kaha, bheed ne usee pramukhataa se jawaab bhi diya
 The stadium echoed with cheer
 jabaki usee jagah par canada ke pradhanmantri stephen harper bhi maujuud the, jo chaar saal pehle manmohan singh kaa bhi canada main swaagat kar chuke the
 The crowd may have confessed, but how would the Prime Minister of Canada have felt
 itnaa hi nahin buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke canada pahunchate hi videsh mantralay ke behad qaabil pravaktaa syed akbaruddin ne twit kiya jiskaa matlab yah tha ki 42 saalon main pehali baar kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa canada daura he
 This is a historical moment
 unhone apane is twit main ‘staneylon’ shabd kaa bhi istemaal kiya jiskaa matlab aage jaakar aapako bataaungaa
 Nevertheless, the perception has become that this is the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Canada in 42 years
 congress netaa shashi tharur ne is daavedaari par aapatti jataai he or kaha he ki pradhanmantri ko tathyon ke chayan me saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 Were you still believing it or did the media talk that this is indeed the first visit to Canada by a Prime Minister in 42 years
 aapke sunne samajhane main galati hui he yaa videsh mantralay or pradhanmantri ko yah baat thodi or spashtataa se kehani chahie thi
 If you watch the Prime Minister's talk carefully, then no mistake will be seen
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa syed ackbaruddin ke twit main bhi koi kami nazar nahin aegi
 You may also wonder if the spokesperson who is so praised will make such a big lapse
 kya har baat par baarik nazar rakhane vaale pradhanmantri ne bhi is tathy ko thik se check nahin kiya hoga
 If you google, you will know that in June 2010, Manmohan Singh went to Canada as Prime Minister
 ab ye bhi ek tathy he lekin shabdon ke her-pher se tathyon kii kaise marketing hoti he, ise donon pradhanmantriyon ke canada daure se siikhaa ja saktaa he
 Manmohan Singh visited Canada at the G-20 conference
 ve sirf canada jane ke liye canada nahin gaye the jaise pradhanmantri narendra modi gaye
 But in June 2010, this Prime Minister Stephen Harper had organized a separate dinner for Manmohan Singh among all the heads of nations
 bhale hi manmohan singh rashtradhyakshon ke sammelan main gaye the lekin canada or bharat ke bich dweepakshiya baat hui or donon ne saajha bayaan par dastakhat bhi kiye, ek panth do kaaj to hua hi na
 The comments kuch websiton ne is tathy ke antar ko thik se samajhaayaa bhi he lekin ek shabd ke fark se saarvajanik rup se samajhadaari main kitna badlaav aa jaataa he
 In this, how much is the lapse of the Prime Minister or the Ministry of External Affairs or how much of the media is there, now what is the use of this controversy
 haa isse agar siikhnaa he to yah baat sikh leni chahie ki netaaon yaa pravaktaaon ke istamaal kiye hue shabdon par darshakon ko bhi baarik nazar rakhane kii aadat daal leni chahie
 You tell me the difference between Modi's visit to Canada for the first time in 42 years and Manmohan Singh's visit to a conference of several countries four years ago
 aapako 42 saal kaa faaslaa dikhaai detaa he yaa 4 saal kaa
 But this story is very funny
 bolne vaala kam galat nazar aata he, samajhane vaala zyada
 You have to be manipulated or you have manipulated your understanding, this decision should be yours
 vaise main bhi 40 ke bahut paar ja chukaa hum magar canada nahin ja sakaa
 Somebody also listen to me

 agar aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki june 2010 main manmohan singh bataur pradhanmantri canada gaye the
 Now this is also a fact, but how the facts are marketed by manipulation of words can be learned from the two Prime Ministers' visit to Canada
 manmohan singh ji-20 ke sammelan main canada gaye the
 He did not go to Canada just to go to Canada like Prime Minister Narendra Modi did
 lekin june 2010 main tamaam rashtradhyakshon ke bich isi pradhanmantri stephen harper ne sirf manmohan singh ke liye alag se raatri bhojan kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Even though Manmohan Singh had gone to the Heads of States Conference, but there was an island-wide discussion between Canada and India and both of them signed a joint statement, there was not a cult
 tippaniyan Some websites have explained the difference of this fact properly, but how much changes in public understanding are made by the difference of one word
 isamen pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantralay kii chook kitni he yaa media kii kitni he ab is vivaad se kya phayda
 Yes, if you want to learn from this, then it should be learned that the audience should also get used to keeping a close watch on the words used by the leaders or spokespersons
 aap hi bataaiye aap 42 saal main pehali baar modi ke canada daure or chaar saal pehle kai deshon ke sammelan ke liye manmohan singh ke daure main kya fark dekhte hai
 You see the difference of 42 years or 4 years
 par ye kissa he bada mazedaarr
 The speaker seems less wrong, the more one understands

 ' bihar main rohtas jile ke raajpur thana antargat ek gaanv main shouch karne ghar se baahar gayi ek dalit kishori ke saath ravivaar ko chaar logon ne samuhik dushkarm kiya

 dilli ke jagpuri ilaake main ek chaar manjila imaarat ke dhah jane kii khabar he
 Many people are feared trapped in the building debris
 praarambhik jaankaree ke anusaar yah imaarat nirmaanadhin thi
 It is difficult to tell how many people have died and how many have been injured in this accident
 dosti, pyaar or muhabbat ye rishton kii neenv vishwaas hoti he, lekin un ladakiyon or mahilaon aagaah hone kii jarurat he jo kisi ajanabi se dosti karti hai, unki baton main funskar un par bharosa karti hai or phir date par jane kii peshkash kabool kar leti hai
 Such girls need to take some precaution now, because maybe your first date can ruin your life
 dilli main kuch ladakiyon ne kabool kiya he ki pehali hi date main ve kathith rup se balaatkaar kaa shikaar hui hai
 The truth is that such incidents of rape are increasing rapidly in the country, but due to fear and slander of the people, the cases do not reach the police station
 is tarah kii party aksar shanivaar kii raat hi hoti he, jahaan javaan dilon kii dhadkan apane pyaar or dosti ko naye tarah se izhaar karti he
 These parties are also known as Saturday Night Fever and this Saturday fever is rapidly rising on every metro in the country
 raat ke das baje nahin ki metro ke har pub or discs par nayi umr ke ladke-ladakiyon kii bheed jamaa ho jaati he
 Many metros are in the grip of such a party in which Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Pune, Chandigarh, Goa, Kolkata are prominent
 sex, lav, dhokhaa or drugs kii giraft main fansati desh kii yuva peedi ko is nashe se bachaane kii pehali pramukh jimmedaari police or norkotics controlbeuro dilli main narkotics control beuro ke jwaint diarector yogesh deshmukh bhi is baat ko sweekaar karte hai or bataaya ki jo aajkal zyaadaatar yuva drugs kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 According to sources, Rev Parties started in Goa a few years ago in Goa and Mumbai
 dhire-dhire iskaa nasha bangalore or dilli ke pub culture main badhane laga
 The rave parties that are happening for fun are now fast becoming an addiction in the country
 magar mumbai, dilli, yaa bangalore main ladkiyaan rev party ke jaal main funskar apane dost se pehali hi mulaakaat yani date rape kaa shikaar ho jaati he
 The problem is that it is not possible to identify date rappers in time
 date rape kii saazish kaa pehla jaal internet par soshal netwarking websites ke jariye buna ja rahaa he or iskaa aakhri chor hota he koi farm house, koi sunsaan makaan yaa phir nite club
 There are many groups of boys in cities like Mumbai and Delhi who weave a trap of trapping girls on social networking sites in the name of friendship
 internet par dosti hui nahin ki mobile numberon kii len-dein hote der nahin lagati or ek baar mobile number aayaa to phir shuru hua mobile par bahaki-bahaki baton kaa daur
 After expressing the friendship and love of the girl, the masterful boys of date rape first meet deliberately in public places or restaurants to show good impressions
 ladki ke dil main thodaa-sa vishwaas jamaa nahin ki phir shuru hota he shikaar ko party ke bahaane farm house yaa phir aise hi kisi sunsaan thikaane tak bulaane kii sajeesh
 That is, the boy calls the girl at the farm house or bungalow on some pretext
 vishwaas jeetne ke liye kuch or dost bhi bulaae jate hai, taaki ladki ekant dekhakar ulate pair waapas naa laut jaae
 The birthday cake is also cut to take the girl completely in confidence and then a period of fun begins
 drinks or jam ke daur ke baad jab bheed chantni shuru hoti he to bachate hai date rape ke shikari or unki shikaar ladki
 When the girl has taken one or two jams, then slowly two drops of drugs are added to her glass
 drinks lete hi kuch hi der main ladki madahosh hone lagati he
 Drugs that are being used to rape a girl by calling on a date, are being sold indiscriminately at drug stores
 aamtaur par jin partiyon main date rape kii saazish rachi jaati he, vahaan bhi in drugs kaa intazaam pehle se hota he
 These drugs are very dangerous
 inaki sirf do boond yaa ek goli pandrah minute main kisi ladki ko laachaari kii had tak madahosh banane ke liye kaaphi he
 Two drops of 'ketamine hydrochloride' are added to the drinks
 desh main jaanwaron ke anaesthesia yani behoshee kii dawa ke taur par iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Ketamine has twenty times more strength than the sleeping drug velium
 ketamine alag-alag dawa ke taur par medical store par uplabdh he
 Apart from ketamine, 'ropanol' which is used in date rape is also known as 'love drugs'
 'flunitrazapam' ke brands nem se bikne vaale ropenul ko date rape kii saazish rachane vaale sabase kargar dawa maanate he
 Another drug is 'GHB' i
e
 'gamma Hydro Butyric Acid', which has neither color, taste nor smell
 lekin gale se utarate hi shikaar ko madahosh kar detii he yah dawa
 According to experts, the drugs that are given to the victim in a date rape are mixed with drinks and the effect is very fast
 ye dawaaen das minute main hi asar karke ladki ko madahosh kar detii hai
 The effect of these drugs lasts for seven to eight hours
 dawa kaa asar rahete ladki kii yaaddaasht kamjor ho jaati he or use apane saath hue dushkarm kii yaad nahin rahati he
 Apparently due to weakness of memory and fear of people, girls are reluctant to register such cases
 lekin ladakiyon ke dilo-dimag par is haadase kaa baari asar padataa he
 The risk of date rape with girls and women in metros has deepened
 dikkat yah bhi he ki sirf ashanka ke chalate vah naa to doston se dur ho sakati hai or naa dost ke bulaane par berth de yaa kisi or party se
 Of course you go to a party, go to a nightclub, but always be vigilant
 jaankaron ke mutabik ladkiyaan agar thodaa-sa bhi ehtiyaat barte to aisi partiyon main shariq hokar bhi date rape ke khatre se batch sakati hai
 1
 kisi party main akele yaa keval ek ladke ke saath jane kii bajaay group main jaaen
 2
 group main ek-do log aise jarur hon jin par aapako puraa bharosa ho
 3
 party main sharaab pine kii jagah ken main milane vaala zeus yaa drinks le
 4
 agar sharaab pi rahi hai to apana gilaas apane hi haath main rakhen or apane saamne paig banavaaen
 5
 farm house kii jagah bade hotel ke discs yaa baar main hi party karen
 6
 party se lautate samay kisi se lift naa len balki bharose ke doston ke saath hi dropping le
 7
 radio taxi kaa number mobile main rakhe or immergency ke samay radio taxi kaa istemaal karen
 8
 party ke samay jaraa-sa bhi chakkar aae yaa tabiyat main badlaav mahasoos karen to fouran apane group ke saath party se baahar nikal jaaen
 At present, both the investigating agencies and the government are serious about clamping down on the increasing trend of debt rape and drug feeding in the country
 is maamle main jahaan jaanch agenciyaan date rape drugs ke banane waalon par kanoonee shinkaja kasne main juty he vahi sarkaar bhi saamaajik bhagidaari kaa istemaal kar naujavaanon ko drugs kaa shikaar hone se rokane ke liye nayi niti bana rahi he
 In India, at the time when people were considering such incidents as a film fantasy, in those days, cases of debt rape had increased so much that in 1996, there was a need to enact a law to deal with date rape
 1996 main america raashtrapati bill clinton ne 'drug indused rape privansion and panishment act' par hastakshar kiya
 Under this law, the use of a drug called 'ropenol' was banned
 chaar saal baad is kanoon ke daayre main 'jiechabi' naam kaa drugs bhi shaamil kar liya gaya, kyonki america main date rape ke liye inhen nashili dawaaiyon kaa sabase zyaada istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha
 Those who use these two drugs in the US can now be sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years

 While warning the employees, the Department of Personnel and Training (dopt) said that any such application made directly to the authorities ignoring the prescribed means of communication should be viewed seriously and appropriate disciplinary action should be taken against those who violate the rules
 nirdeshon main kaha gaya ki yadi koi sarkari karmchaaree koi daawa karnaa chahta he yaa phir shikaayat kaa nipataara chahta he to uske liye uchit yahi he ki vah apane tatkaal varisht adhikari ko yaa karyaalay pramukh ko yaa uchit str vaale kisi anya adhikari ko patr likhe, jo sakasham ho
 It would be considered indecent conduct in the case of writing directly to higher officials
 tippaniyan The dopt said that despite such instructions, it has been found that direct letters are written directly to the Prime Minister, Secretary (personnel) and other higher officials on behalf of government employees, including officers and officers of the army and paramilitary forces

 aam aadmi ko raahat dene ke naam par dilli kii satta par kabiz hui aam aadmi party ne power sabsidi kaa elaan to kiya, lekin iskaa phayda aam tabake se zyada khaas tabake tak hi simata he
 Daily laborers, students or other people who are tenants are not getting this subsidy facility
 inaki bijli kii khapat bhale nichle slab par simata ho, lekin rate sabase upar ke slab kaa dena hota he
 Landlords charge an electricity charge of 8 to 10 rupees from these people
 dakshini dilli ke katvariyaa sarai kaa ek chota-sa cameraa jisamen ek pankhaa
 
 ek tubalite, do-teen balb or ek laptop kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 Overall power expenditure is hardly 35 to 50 units in a month
 jabaki manish ko 8 rupee unit ke hisaab se bijli kaa bill dena padataa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party government announced electricity subsidy as soon as it arrived, according to which - 0 se 200 unit tak 4 rupee - 5 on 201 to 400 units
 95 ru kaa rate - 7 on 401 to 800 units
 30 ru or - 8 from 801 to 1200 units
 10 ru kaa rate hoga Sadhna, who lives in Munirka, says that with the arrival of the Aam Aadmi Party, there was no difference in the rate of electricity for them either
 pehle bhi 8 rupee dene hote the or ab bhi
 Who can buy an agreement with the landlord? sadhana bamushkil 100 unit har maheene kharch karti hai, lekin makaan maalik 8 rupee ke hisaab se hi rate vasuulata he
 It is said that there are some such people, who are paying the price according to 10 rupees
 yani kharch bhale nichle slab kaa ho
 
 paisa sabase upar vaale slab kaa hi lagegaa
 To say that all the meters have been installed, but instead of giving relief, it is used in the book according to the landlord
 koi bhi camere par khul kar nahin bolta, aisa karnaa maujuuda makaan maalik se sidhaa panga lenaa he
 On the other hand, the landlords also have a ready answer that there are 20-25 tenants in the same building, even if the sub-meter is different
 lekin main meter ek hone se bill hajaar unit se kam nahin aata
 So why should we give concession to tenants out of our pocket? idhar, sabase kamjor tabake tak raahat pahunchane kaa daawa karne vaali dilli sarkaar ke dipti siem is maukey par haath chhaad lete hai
 Manish Sisodia says what should the government do in this
 yah masalaa makaan maalik or kirayedaron ke bich he to unako agreement us hisaab se bananaa chahie
 Perhaps this is the reason that this relief is still meaningless for millions of people who are of the poor and economical spending class
 urja ke jaankaar rajeev kakaria bataate hai ki dilli main takreeban 43 lakh meter hai
 Of this, about 30 to 3
2 million meters belong to domestic consumers
 maanakar chaliye ki takreeban 5 lakh logon ne kirayedar rakh rakhe hai
 These 5 lakh people have also given four to four rooms on an average, so 20 lakh sub meters
 aise main maanakar chaliye ki 20 lakh aam aadmi isse vanchit he

 There are many such parties of the opposition that accompany Modi's 'one nation, one election'
 jabaki congress sahit kai kshetreey dal puri tarah se virodh main he
 They say that when elections are held simultaneously, the tenures of the legislatures will be increased or decreased

 Out of the assembly elections held in four states along with the Lok Sabha, the BJP has managed to win only in Arunachal Pradesh, with regional parties recording a record victory in the remaining three states

 This evening i was confronted with Bandanwaj Beardraj Seculardas on the same matter
 maje kii baat yah he ki ve jaraa bhi vichlit nahin hue maanon pehle se hi taiyaar hon
 i said, 'I will take your interview today
 vetapak se bole,sawaal to pucho
 i stammered many questions simultaneously
 
 
 1
 Why did this 'PK' anti-jamaat breed? How has its strength and strength grown so much in the last few years? 2
 dilli dange secular or gujarat dange communal kaise hote?3
 How would Hindu communals and saved Muslims who were driven from Kashmir become secular? 4
 ekmaatr muslim bahul aabaadi kaa kshetra apni hindu appliyat ke apmaan, hatya or balaatkaar kaa secular mookadarshak kyon bana rahaa?5
 For the same purpose, Muslims were called secular and Hindu communal as if every 'khan' was secular and 'singh' communal? 6
 tasalima nasrin or rushadi par chuppi tathaa hossain or 'pike' par hangaamaa kya sabit karata he?7
 Why have the words secular-communal become a subject of mockery today? i was a bit tired by the time the questions were over, but Secular Das remained motionless

 Thanks to Chandrakant Prasad Singh's blog 'U and Me') kaala dhan nakad main he yaa sone main, jameen main boyaa gaya he yaa phir imaaraten banakar khadaa he, notebandi se kitni kaalikh baahar aegi, in kayaason ke bich is par bhi charchaa ho jaani chahie ki kaala dhan kahaan ban rahaa he or kis vajah se
 We have become a very interesting country in terms of earning black
 eemaandaar log apni bachat nikaalane ke liye police se pit rahe hai jabaki duusari ore sarkaar ke abhiyaan kii lagaam jinke haath he, paardarshita ke maamle main unka record bharat main sabase sandigdh he
 Banks and tax departments are the mascots of the Modi government's cleanliness drive, but the tax system has played the biggest role in the production of black money and the banking and financial system is the most effective in hiding or washing it, both of which are sharing certificates of integrity
 sabhi adhyayan or kaale dhan par 2012 kaa sarkari shwet patr maanate hai ki bharat kaa tex system kaale dhan kii buniyadi vajah he
 Most of the tax is on consumption which is based on trade, hence trade is also the creator of black money, the holder as well as the victim
 bharat main vyapaar kaa bahut bada hissaa nakad par aadhaarit he, isliye adhikansh aedcounted nakad (jo puri tarah kaala dhan nahin he) trade main he
 It is important to note some statistics: Business and related activities, such as transport, and various financial services, account for 30–35 per cent of GDP
 yah jidipi main kheti ke hisse kaa doguna, udyog ke hisse se 10 fisadi zyada he
 12 percent of the economy runs on cash
 adhikansh vyapaar nakad main he
 Dependence on debt is limited, so the business has its own credit system (borrowing), in which bulk purchases occur first and payments are made later
 iske jariye vyapaaree cash flo santulit karte hai
 The bulk of the revenue comes from taxes on consumption
 tex kii adhikansh vasuuli pratyaksh yaa paroksh taur par vyapaar kendrit he
 India is among the most taxing countries on consumption
 iskar kii daren bhi oonchi hai
 Most of the black money is consumed by evasion of taxes on trade
 vyapaaree tex dena chaahate hai lekin chori isliye hoti he kyonki ek—kaarobaari laagat oonchi he, tex kaa boj laabh ke margin simit kar detaa hai, do—khapat kii vishalata ke saamne tex system kii kshamtaayen bahut simit hai or teen—tex niyamon ke paalan kii laagat yani complians cost bahut zyada he
 This is the reason why the profits of business come out of tax evasion, in which the corrupt tax system is helpful
 bank or vittiya sevaayen bhi peeche nahin hai
 Banks are not only notorious for submerging the deposits of common people in large corporate debts but the Reserve Bank is also troubled by the washing of black money in these banks after demonetisation
 bahut bade paimaane par kaala dhan kanoonee gativadhiyon ke jariye banataa he
 There are dozens of avenues hidden in corporate, sales and business accounting
 kagaji companiyaan, out of book tranjaikshan, cash in hand, kai account book, utpaadan kam dikhaakar, kharch main badhotaree, bikri kii raseedon main herpher karke bahut-sa kaala dhan ghumaya, khapaaya or chipaaya jaataa he
 This accounting sphere is in the eyes of banks as most of the business activities are in the network of banks
 tex chori or farji acounting se bane kaale dhan ke netaa va adhikariyon tak pahunchane kii yatra dilachasp he
 Most of India's corruption is due to lack of services and facilities
 udaarikaran ke baad inaki maang badi, aapurti nahin
 There is a huge gap in demand and supply of services everywhere from railway reservation to no objection certificate, from school admission to building a house
 jahaan yah antar gata, vahaan bhrashtachar (telephone, gas, kaaren) khatm ho gaya
 In the midst of this shortage, a small group of officers and leaders have tremendous power, which extends from giving very common facilities to sharing rights and justice
 bhrashtachar par kai survey bataate rahe hai ki bharat main 76 fisadi rishwat 2
 5 lakhs
 se kam kii hoti he
 77 percent of the bribes are given on time to work or to avoid business losses
 kaarobaari haani bachaane or pratispardhaa main badhat lene kii sabase zyada niyamit jarurat udyog va vyapaar ko he
 This is the reason why black money created by tax evasion reaches the leader-officers, who are equipped with the right to share opportunities
 ej aaf duing bijness ranking main 189 deshon ke bich bharat kii ranking 130veen he or tex ke maamle main 187veen
 These difficulties form the basis of bribes
 bharat main sarkarein betkalluf kharch karti hai
 They need very high tax and high debt
 yahi vajah he ki bank or tex puure tantra kii sabase mahatvapurn lekin ghatiya kadi hai
 The economy is stalled due to the closure of big notes because the trade is closed which is the engine of economy and the fuel of this engine is cash (cash to GDP ratio)
 hamen pataa nahin ki bharat kaa vishaal vyapaar tantra jo bijepi kaa voter bhi he vah sarkaar ke faisle par kisi pratikriya karegaa lekin itnaa jarur pataa he kivyapaar arthvyavastha buree tarah tut gai he

 Otherwise, the bribes will continue and black money will be consumed

 Market experts point out that the government's decision to tax share buybacks and increase minimum public shareholding in listed companies has created an atmosphere of disappointment among domestic investors

 ) westeindies daure ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle team india ke captain viraat kohli se press conference main yah sawaal poocha gaya ki unhen vanade or tii-20 siries ke liye aaraam diya gaya tha, to vah achaanak iske liye kaise taiyaar ho gaye
 Let us tell you that on June 23, suddenly the news came that the Virat Kohli has sought rest from the BCCI in the T20 and ODI series of the Indies tour
 lekin semifinal main haar se world cap safar khatm hone ke baad vah indies daure ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 There were also reports that if Virat Kohli did not join the T20 and ODI team in the West Indies tour, Rohit Sharma could get a chance as captain again
 rohit ko viraat kii gairmaujuudagi main jab bhi kaman mili, unhone team india kii behatar captaini kii
 Also, it was reported from BCCI sources that the board is considering making a separate captain in limited overs cricket
 mana ja rahaa tha ki shaayad is baat ne viraat ko puure daure par khilne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 But at a press conference held in Mumbai on Monday, Team India captain Virat Kohli made it clear that none of the team's former physio or trainer told him that he should not play limited overs cricket for the rest on the West Indies tour
 aisi khabaren thi ki jasprit bumraah or kohli ko aaraam diya jayega, lekin kohli ne kaha ki kisi ne unase nahin kaha ki unka kaarybhaar nirdhaarit seemaa se adhik he
 Kohli said, 'we have a complete record of rest time
 board ko die gaye email par sab rahata he
 i do not know if the report has been made
 jab tak physio yaa trainer mujhase nahin kehete, mujhe nahin pataa
 i do not know what email was sent to the selectors as i was not asked to rest
 'captaini ke liye taiyaar khadey the rohit sharma !viraat kohli yadi westeindies daure main tii-20 or vanade team se nahin judate, to captain ke rup main ek baar phir rohit sharma ko mauka miltaa
 After the defeat in the World Cup, there was a demand that Rohit Sharma be made the captain of odis and T20s

 Nitesh is the son of former Maharashtra Chief Minister and sitting Congress MLA Narayan Rane

 The case has been registered on the complaint of the owner of Hotel Estella near Nitesh's house
 hotel estela ke maalik nikhil mirani or hitesh kesavani oktober 2016 se mumbai ke upnagar juhu main kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 He has stated in his complaint that Nitesh Rane was pressurizing him to participate in the hotel and threatened to shut down the hotel if he refused, otherwise asked to pay a ransom of Rs 10 lakh every month
 isi dauraan 18 may 2017 ko raat 10:30 baje do logon ne hotel main ghuskar huddang machaaya
 The police have also arrested two people who created a brawl while conducting this complaint
 saath hi vidhayak nitesh rane ke khilaaf phiroti maangane kaa maamla darj kiya he
 While accused Nitesh Rane is calling this case a conspiracy to defame him
 vidhanbhavan main media se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki hotel estela ke paas hi main unke parivaar kaa ghar he
 The whole family is upset with this hotel and has complained about its loud music playing
 police ne hamaari shikaayat par to abtak karrwai nahin kii
 Why so? The comments aise main ab rajya congress rane kaa samarthan karte hue sarkaar par palatwaar kii taiyaari main he
 Congress MLA Prithviraj Chavan told the media that a conspiracy is going on against the Congress leaders across the country
 jabaki sarkaar ke bachaav ke liye shivasena netaa or mantri ekanath scindia aage aae hai
 Shinde has denied the allegations of Congress

 Notorious Naxalite leader Pahad Singh, who surrendered in Chhattisgarh, will ask three states to surrender
 ek karod kaa inami pahaad singh chhattisgarh ke alaava madhya pradesh or maharashtra main bhi kai badi vaardaaton ko anjaam de chukaa he
 He has made many shocking revelations in Chhattisgarh Police in Bhilai
 usne chunaav ke dauraan badi naksali sajeesh kaa bhi plan police ko bataaya he
 Pahar Singh was the head of the Zonal Committee of Naxalites and was involved in many Naxalite activities for the last 20 years
 bataa den ki aadha darjan se zyadanxliganman kii suraksha main rahakar chhattisgarh, maharashtra or madhya pradesh kii seemaa main laal aatank kaa paryaay ban chuke inami naksali commander pahaad singh ne durg range ke aiji jeepi singh ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kiya tha
 The police are considering it as their biggest success
 yah aatmasamarpan us vakt hua he, jab bastar main suraksha balon ne naksaliyon par baari dabaav banaaya he
 On the other hand, to avoid this pressure, the Naxalites had started the initiative to make the border of these three states their safe haven
 is sarhad par balaghat, rajanandgaanv, gondia or gatchiroli main naksaliyon ne apana nayaa jone banaaya tha
 It was the responsibility of Pahar Singh, but angry with the functioning of the big Naxalite leaders, Pahar Singh surrendered and joined the mainstream of the country
 naksalileader pahaad singh urf kumaar saay urf ram mohan singh toppo ke upar sirf chhattisgarh main hi 47 lakh rupee kaa inaam tha
 In three states, the amount of reward is being stated above one crore
 aiji jeepi singh ne bataaya ki pahaad singh ne teenon rajyon main kai badi vaardaaton ko anjaam diya he
 He was the secretary of GRB division
 lambey samay se police ko uski talash thi, lekin har baar search oparation ke dauraan vah batch nikalataa tha
 He is quite adept at dodging the police and security forces
 aiji jeepi singh ke mutabik pahaad singh ke maharashtra, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii special jonal cameti ke sachiv banane ke baad naksaliyon ke hausale buland ho rahe the, lekin ab is aatmasamarpan se unke armaanon par bhi pani phir gaya he
 He said that its dedication is a big success for the police and a big blow to the Naxalite organization
 isse na sirf naksaliyon kii qamar tuutegi, balki chunaav ke dauraan unke abhiyaanon par bhi vipareet prabhaav padegaa
 Pahar Singh is originally from Phaphamar village in Rajnandgaon
 aiji jeepi singh ne bataaya ki adivaasiyon ke saath ho rahe nar sanhaar se pahaad singh kaaphi peedit tha
 He said that by accusing the Naxalite tribesmen of being a police informer and sometimes not taking part in their agitation, they are killing them
 isse aahat hokar pahaad singh ne aatmasamarpan kiya
 He said that Naxal MMC has suffered a major setback with Pahar Singh returning to the mainstream
 pahaad singh ek acha vaktaa bhi he
 Because of this, he is also adept at taking the people sitting and adding them to his organization
 iskaa phayda abhi tak naksali sanghathan uthaa rahe the
 After surrender, Pahar Singh also lambasted the Naxalites for their actions
 usne sweekaar kiya ki naksali vichaardhaara se prabhavit hokar usne 20 saal pehle naksali ban gaya tha, lekin ab naksalwad puri tarah se bhatak chukaa he
 Naxalites are now considered criminals and are known for robbery
 isliye usne unka saath chhodane kaa faisla kiya
 Another government scheme has come up in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 centre sarkaar alpsankhyakon main paaramparik kala or samudaay se sambandhit hastkala ko badhaava dene ke liye kaushal vikaas tathaa prashikshanyojna‘ustad’ shuru kii jaayegi
 This scheme will be launched from Varanasi itself
 alpsankhyak maamalon ke rajya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki ustad yojana ko 14 may ko pradhanmantrinarendra modike sansadeey kshetravaranasise shuru kiya jayega
 He said, "the intention of the ministry is to make minority workers associated with development-oriented sectors a part of the larger market network
 kaushal vikaas, shiksha, karj kii uplabdhta kii is ranneeti main ahm bhoomika hogi
 The Union Minister said that the procedures of schemes related to the welfare of minorities are very complex which the ordinary person is not able to fulfill
 mantralay in prakriyaaon ko saral bana rahaa he
 The initiative is being taken by the central government at a time when, according to the Sachar Committee report, a quarter of the 6 to 14-year-old children of the Muslim community leave school in the middle and many of them are outside the purview of school education
 17 saal se adhik aayu varg main is samudaay ke bacchon kii shaikshanik uplabdhi 17 fisadi he jabaki rashtriya ausat 26 fisadi he
 At the middle school level, only 50 percent of the children complete schooling as against the national average of 62 percent

 In this regard, Naqvi said that various schemes are being reviewed and all states have been asked to spend the entire amount of funds
 -input bhashaa se Election, Bihar and caste factor - these three are synonymous with each other
 bihar main chunaav ho or jatiy ganit kii baat na ho aisa sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa
 Even though for the Lok Sabha elections 2019, all the parties have been divided into two camps of NDA and Grand Alliance, but this time the caste is showing the biggest factor in political multiplication, seat sharing and selection of candidates
 jati par aadhaarit raajnneeti ke chalate khemon ke andar kheme or khemon ke khilaaf kheme khadey hote dikh rahe hai
 There are more than two hundred and fifty castes in Bihar
 rajya kii 40 loksabhaa siton kii ladaai main utre tamaam dalon ne aabaadi or siton ke ganit ke hisaab se tikat baante hai yaa ummidavaar utaare hai
 How many tickets from which party to which caste? NDA has announced candidates for 39 of the 40 seats in Bihar
 jabaki mahagathbandhan abhi tak 33 ummidavaaron ke naam tay kar paaya he
 The NDA has given tickets to 13 people of the 'general category'
 inamen se 7 rajput samudaay se, 3 bhoomihaar jati se, do brahman or ek ummidavaar kysth jati se he
 The 12 candidates are from the OBC community
 jisamen 5 yadav, 3 kushvaha, 3 vaisya or ek kurmi jati se he
 There are 7 candidates belonging to the Extremely Backward Classes, including Dhanuk, Kewat, Gangeyi, Gonsai, Nishad, Gangota and Chandravanshi
 6 dalit ummidavaar hai, jinamein 4 paswan jabaki ravivaas or musahar jati ke 1-1 ummidavaar hai
 At the same time, the caste mathematics of the grand alliance is different
 argedy em-vaai sameekaran yani lalu ke puraane yadav-muslim formule par focus kiye hue hai
 RJD has announced candidates for 18 seats out of the 19 Lok Sabha seats on its account, out of which 8 Yadavs, 4 Muslims, 3 Rajputs, 2 Dalits and 1 seat are backward candidates
 vahiin congress 9 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 Among these, Shatrughan Sinha (kayastha) from Patna
 purniya se udai singh urf pappu singh, katihaar se tarik anwar ko mauka diya he
 The RLSP has not yet announced the names of its candidates
 lekin ummidavaari ke saamaajik sameekaran kaa khulaasa kar diya he
 The RLSP says that Kushwaha from West Champaran, Savarnas from East Champaran, Kushwaha from Karakat, Scheduled Castes from Jamui and Kushwaha community from Ujiarpur are given tickets

 The BJP is considered to have a good hold over the upper caste votes
 isi tarah yadav voton ko saadhane ke liye bhi bijepi front foot par khel rahi he
 BJP state president Nityanand Rai comes from the Yadav community
 bijepi ke bihar prabharee bhupendra yadav bhi isi samudaay se aate hai
 In Lalu's absence, the BJP has focused on securing RJD votes
 jabaki nitish kumaar kii jediu kii kurmi samudaay or pasmanda muslimon main acchhee paith he
 At the same time, Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP governs the Dalits

 Two years, two months and 10 days later, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) finally delivered a verdict on the controversial case of Indian citizen Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav
 pakistan ne unhen 2016 main bandi banaaya tha or un par jasusi tathaa aatankwaad failaane ke aarope lagaakar maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 When officials exited the Great Hall of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, India declared victory in the courtyard of the Peace Palace
 videsh mantralay main sanyukt sachiv pieaai (pakistan, afghanistan or iran) or is maamle ke liye isije ke agent deepak mittal ke netritv main bhartiya pratinidhimandal ko bharosa tha ki antarrashtriya samjhauton ke ulanghan ke muddon par bharat majboot sthiti main he
 In cases of 'contact with the embassy', there was an open violation of pre-determined rules of the ICJ and on the basis of this India was in a 'strong position'
 bharat ne jin do maamalon kaa hawala diya tha—lagrand (germany banaam america) or avena (mexico banaam america)—unamem antarrashtriya nyaayalay ne un deshon ke paksh main nirnay liya tha, jinhone antarrashtriya samjhauton ke anupaalan kaa anurodh kiya tha jinamein vienna kanvension on consular relations (visiarasi) bhi shaamil hai
 Although the ICJ did not cross its jurisdiction, India's case was heard impartially
 isije ne bharat ke paksh main faisla sunaaya or adaalat is nishkarsh par pahunchi ki pakistan ne jadhav ko duutavas se sampark kii anumati na dekar visisiar ke anuchhed 36 kaa ulanghan kiya tha
 The judgment said, "pakistan must inform Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav of his rights without further delay and according to Article 36 of the Vienna Convention, the Indian consulate authorities will have access to them
 ''faisle kii 'samiksha' or sajaa ke dand par 'punarvichaar' kaa isije kaa aadesh bharat kii badi jeet he, kyonki bharat kii ore se praathmik anurodh nishpaksh jaanch or kanoonee sahaayta tathaa duutavas tak pahunch pradaan karne kaa hi kiya gaya tha
 But the court said that Pakistan would have to arrange an effective review of the trial on Jadhav and reconsider his conviction
 isije ke faisle kaa yahi vah pahalu he jisko lekar pakistan apni jeet kaa daawa kar rahaa he kyonki use jadhav ko reeha karne ko nahin kaha gaya he or use apni icchaanusaar faisla karne kaa adhikaar mila he
 India will have to wait for how Pakistan interprets this court's remark, but it is certain that whatever path it takes, the embassy will have to facilitate contact with Jadhav
 pakistan, bharat or pakistan ke bich 2008 ke dwipaksheeya samjhaute kaa hawala dekar jasusi ke maamalon par vichaar karne ke liye ek alag rasta nikaalane kii firaaq main tha, lekin adaalat ne mana ki rashtron ke bich dwipaksheeya samjhaute badi sandhiyon se upar nahin ho sakate
 ICJ Judge Abdulkavi Ahmad Yusuf said in the judgment, "article 36 of the Vienna Agreement clearly states that whichever country the citizen belongs to has the right to contact and communicate with the embassy of that country and espionage cases are no exception
" ''faisle kaa antim or bahut mahatvapurn pahalu rahaa maut kii sajaa par isije kaa faisla
 It declared that "until the process of effective review and reconsideration of the case of Mr
 Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav is completed, he cannot be punished
" '' iskaa prabhavi arth he ki pakistan main jab tak maamle kii nishpaksh sunwaayee puri nahin hoti, tab tak jadhav ko faansee nahin di ja sakati
 The decision of the ICJ is final and there is no scope for its review
 haalanki, sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) ke donon sthaayee sadsy america or china sahit kuch anya deshon ko antarrashtriya nyaayalay ke faislon kaa ulanghan karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The UNSC is the only other body where its permanent members can raise cases of such violations
 lekin chunki pakistan or bharat donon hi iske sadsy nahin hai, isliye unase ummid kii jaati he ki ve isije ke kisi bhi faisle kaa paalan karenge
 The ICJ came to the conclusion that Pakistan violated the provisions of contact with the embassy written in Article 36 of the Vienna Agreement *** kuch rajyon main upachunaav ke nattejey paksh main nahin hone ke baavjood bhaajapa hataash nahin he or use maharashtra ke bhandara- gondia tathaa palghar loksabhaa siton par hone vaale upachunaavon main jeet kaa puraa bharosa he

 Theresa May wins the voting on a no-confidence motion brought by the opposition
 bibisi ke mutabik, vipakshi lebar party ke avishvaas prastaav ke paksh main 306 vot pade hai, jabaki virodh main 325 saansadon ne vot kiye
 Thus the crisis over the government in Theresa was clouded and the threat of her government falling was currently averted
 haalanki, europea sangh se britain ko baahar rakhane ke unke prastaav par aage kya hoga, yah sthiti abhi spasht nahin he
 Parliament voted on Tuesday on Prime Minister Theresa May's proposal to separate Britain from the European Union
 british sansad yani house of comons main theresa me ke samjhaute ke paksh main 202 vot or virodh main 432 vot pade the
 Even 118 of his own Conservative Party mps rejected his proposal
 iske baad vipakshi lebar party theresa me sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laai, jis par bhartiya samyaanusaar buudhvaar der raat voting karai gai
 In this voting, 325 mps stood in support of Theresa May and voted against the no-confidence motion, while 306 mps supported the opposition's no-confidence motion
 is tarah theresa me jeet gayi or unki sarkaar girane kaa sankat philhal tal gaya he
 britainbritain gained 28-member EU membership in the European Union since 1973
 use 29 march ko is union se alag hona he
 Theresa May presented an agreement about this
 is samjhaute par unhen vipakshi lebar party ke netaa jeremi corbin samet apni party ke saansadon kaa virodh jhelana padaa
 When his vote was voted in Parliament, he faced the worst defeat in history
 house of kamans main unka prastaav 202 ke mukaable 432 maton se gir gaya
 That is, this difference of 230 votes is the worst defeat of any British PM in modern history
 vipaksh ne samjhaute ko bataaya adhakacharawipakshi lebar party ke netaa jeremi corbin ne theresa me kii haar ko vinaashkari bataate hue unke prastaav par bhi tippanee kii
 Describing Theresa's proposal of Corbyn as half-baked and damaging, the agreement would be like a blind leap for Britain
 theresa kii haar ke kuch hi minuton baad jeremi corbin ne theresa me sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane kaa elaan kar diya
 After which there was a discussion in the whole world that the government of Theresa May is now in danger
 tamaam kism ke kayaas lagaae jane lage
 But the very next day, when voting on this no-confidence motion took place, Jeremy Corbyn failed in his objective and 325 mps supported Theresa May
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki bregsit par kya samaadhaan nikal paata he
 Because according to the rules, when mps reject a bill, the Prime Minister has three working days to come to Parliament with another plan
 yani ab avishvaas prastaav ke sankat se ubarne ke baad theresa me ke saamne bregsit par ek aisa samjhauta laane kii chunauti he, jis par puri sansad sahamat ho sake or europea union se baahar hone kaa britain kaa rasta saaf ho sake

 He admitted that there was pressure on the team to play from Australia
 unhone kaha,austrailia ke khilaaf khelnaa behad khaas tha or iskaa dabaav bhi tha
 When Dhoni was out, i still knew that Raina would come down now and thought that if we add 40 runs, it will be good

 According to filmgoer Amod Mehra, the performance of the film is disappointing at the box office and the film was rejected by the audience
 film kaa prachaar kiya gaya yah bataakar kii yah lav story nahin he, jabaki film ek prem kahani hi he
 The drama of flashbacks and climaxes is not digesting the audience all the time

 Jharkhand Agriculture Minister Yogendra Sav, who is in controversy, has come down to Gandhigiri for admission to his residence allotted by the government
 kabhi apane dabangai ke liye mashhoor congress cote ke ye mantri aajkal sar par gandhi topi or haath main gulab liye gum rahe hai
 In fact, the housing minister has been allotted to the former chief secretary SK Chaudhary and former railway DG Kumud Chaudhary

 kumud choudhary apane samay kii dabang police adhikari thi
 According to the minister, when the last time the supporters of the minister arrived to vacate the house, the dog was left on his supporters
 vaise yogendra saav bhi kam dabang nahin hai
 Recently he was in the discussion due to his statements
 unhone ekbar yahaan tak kah diya tha ki mantri pad ke liye sonia gandhi se lekar ahamed patel tak pairvi bhidani padi, saath hi juuta polis or chandi paath karnaa padaa

 On December 28, when the opposition called India off, Naqvi said for whom the day of anger is for those who keep black money
 vipaksh ke baad kehane ke liye kuch nahin rahaa he isliye tukbandi karke sansad ko nahin chalane de rahaa he
 When PM came to the house, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that the PM has come in the house and will come forward and also participate in the discussion but these people are not allowing the house to run

 The decision that we have taken regarding black money could have been taken in a similar way so that no one gets time to keep black money
 jitendra singh bole ki piem ne sahi kaha he ki jo log iskaa virodh kar rahe he wo is liye kar rahe he, kyonki unhenkala dhanchhupane ke liye samay nahin mila
 Gradually the queues in the banks are getting reduced, lines will stop soon

 Sharad pawar-ajit Pawar, Bal thackeray-raj Thackeray, Gopneeth munde-dhananjay Munde, these are examples of how the uncle-nephew battle in political families in Maharashtra is not new
 vartmaan maamla pavaar parivaar kaa he jahaan chachaa-bhattije kii ladaai ke chalate maharashtra ke raajnneetik ghatnakram ne ek nayaa mode le liya he
 Due to this there is a lot of uneasiness in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 maharashtra main rakanpa se pehle shivasena or bhaajapa bhi chachaa-bhattije kii ladaai se do-chaar ho chuki hai
 On Saturday, Ajit Pawar went against party mentor and his uncle Sharad Pawar and took oath of office with the BJP as Deputy Chief Minister of the state
 unki baghawat or bhaajapa ko samarthan dene ke nirnay ne na sirf rakanpa ko jhakzor kar rakh diya, balki ek-duusare se kareeb se jude parivaar ko bhi hilaa diya
 After the death of his brother Anant Rao, Sharad Pawar took his son Ajit Pawar under his protection
 ajit pavaar ne 1991 main pehali baar baraamati se sansadeey chunaav ladaa or jeet darj kii
 When Sharad Pawar became Defense Minister in PV Narasimha Rao government in 1991, Ajit gave him this seat
 yah mahaj shuruyaat thi
 Seven-time MLA and former Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was seen as the political successor to the NCP chief, but tensions began when Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule entered politics
 isi tarah kaa vivaad thakare parivaar main bhi lagbhag ek dashak pehle hua tha
 The Shiv Sena eventually got torn up due to a dispute between Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray
 bal thakare ne bhattije kii tulana main apane bete uddhav ko tavajjo di or raaj thakare ne nai party bana lee
 Like the Pawar and Thackeray families, there was a dispute in the Munde family
 varsh 2009 main jab obisi netaa gopinath munde bid se vijayi hue to zyaadaatar logon ne sochaa ki vidhansabha chunaav main vah apane bhattije dhananjay munde ko utaarenge lekin isaki jagah unhone apni beti pankaja munde ko parali seat se maidan main utaara
 This deepened the discord between uncle and nephew and Dhananjay Munde joined the NCP
 baad main vah vidhaan parishad main netaa vipaksh bane
 After Gopinath Munde's death, the family rivalry often came into the limelight
 2014 main pankaja munde ne parali se apane chachere bhai ko haraa diya
 At the same time, in 2019, Dhananjay Mude defeated his cousin Pankaja by reversing the game
 maharashtra main aise or bhi udhaaharan hai
 In the last month assembly elections, Shiv Sena's Jayadatta Kshirsagar was defeated by his nephew and NCP candidate Sandeep Kshirsagar from Beed seat

 The film 'dhoni: The Untold Story' made by Mahendra Singh Dhoni is very much liked by cricket fans
 magar film main ek seen ko lekar dhoni ke puraane saathi or team india ke purv khilaadi mohammad kaiff ko apni safaai deni padi he
 The comments film main dhoni jab vanade cricket ke apane pehle match main bangladesh ke khilaaf maidan par utarate hai to duusare chor par kaiff ballebaazi kar rahe hote hai
 Dhoni tries to take a run on the first ball but runs out without opening an account

 Kaif clarified on the tweet that "no brother, i had no mistake
 " Kaif recalls his first meeting with Dhoni, stating that “I first saw MS Dhoni at the Deodhar Trophy
 main central zone kaa captain tha, or dhoni ne east zone ke liye khelte hue tabadatod 84 ran maare or ham match haar gaye

 Team India, who defeated England 4–0 in the five-test series, will not get a prize money from the board this time
 board hameshaa acha pradarshan karne par senior yaa under-19 team ko inami raashi detaa he, lekin is baar wo aisa nahin kar paaegaa
 The reason behind this is the order of the Supreme Court which has limited the financial independence and rights of the BCCI
 supreme court ne tab tak sabase amir board ke adhikaron ko simit kar diya he, jab tak ki wo lodha samiti kii siforeeshon ko nahin maan le
 BCCI still needs approval of the Supreme Court for disbursement of any amount
 senior team ko aam taur par baari bharkam protsaahan raashi milti he
 When the team defeated South Africa in a four-match series in 2015, it received a prize money of Rs 2 crore
 aise menengland par aitihaasik 4-0 kii jitahasil karne vaaliviraat senaco protsaahan raashi ke liye kuch adhik intjaar karnaa hoga
 Nothing can happen before the hearing on January 3
 isse pehle court ne england ke khilaaf har test match ke aayojan ke liye 58 lakh 66 hajaar rupee aavantit kiye the or simit overon ke har match ke liye 25 lakh rupee jari karne kii apil kii he
 The Indian cricket team came from England after losing a series of five Test matches or returning with a draw, in fact it would not make much difference to the future of Indian cricket
 chaar varshon ke baad ham phir se england main ek or paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa khel rahe honge
 In fact, India has gained this strength in world cricket on the strength of its immense economic power
 bharat pichley 55 varshon se england main paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa kheltaa aa rahaa he or ab tak bharat sari shrunkhlaayein buree tarah harata aayaa he
 In the current series, England have taken an unbeatable lead in the series after beating India badly in two consecutive matches at Manchester and Old Trafford
 bharat kii 1952 yaa 1959 main england kaa daura karne vaali team yadi maujuuda daure par rakshaatmak ravaiye ke saath utarati to vah bhi lords test jarur jeet leti
 On the other hand, the current England team will certainly be considered weaker than the 50s
 iske baavjood ve aasaani se lagaataar do match jeet lete hai
 One thing has become clear from the Lord's Test that Indian bowlers, like any other English bowler, have the ability to swing and bounce in the English environment
 lekin lords test ke baad achaanak saare ballebaaj apni jimmedaariyon se bhaagate najar aae
 The Indian team certainly did not get a chance to play friendly matches between the two matches in the current Test, so that they could assess their additional players
 har siries main bharat ke liye kuch ginati ke khilaadi hi nijee taur par shandaar pradarshan karte najar aate hai or aisa hi kuch is siries main bhi dekhne ko mila
 However, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not appear to be making unrestrained excuses like the former captains
 lagaataar kharaab pradarshan kar rahi team ko behatar pradarshan kii or le jane kaa karnama bahut kam captain kar pate hai or dhoni bhi isamen apwaad nahin ban sake
 On the other hand, after losing the series 1-0, English captain Alastair Cook did this feat
 test maichon main purvaabhyas kaa kya mahatv hota he, bhartiya team ko dekhakar samajha ja saktaa he
 Gautam Gambhir, the returning batsman after a long time, was enough to send him the pavilion here, the shots on which he was able to get the boundary behind the wicket in the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 do maheene se kisi antarrashtriya pratispardhaa main na khilne vaale gambhir kii apeksha nishchit taur par rohit sharma ko bulaanaa shaayad dhoni ke liye phaayde vaala ho saktaa tha
 There were high expectations from Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara, who were seen as India's future captains, but both batsmen disappointed
 sabase ascharyajanak rahaa spin khilne main maharathi samajhi jane vaali bhartiya team kaa moin ali jaise part time spin gendbaaj ke aage ghutane tech baithna
 On the other hand Indian bowlers have given bitter lessons to expert batsmen with their batting
 sirf ajinkya rahane ne thodaa sangharsh karne kaa jajba dikhaaya he
 Captain Dhoni's decisions have also been questioned over a number of decisions including the selection of players
 in sabake baavjood bhartiya team ke liye sab kuch khatm nahin hua he, jo team lords main jeet hasil kar sakati he, vahiin da ovel main bhi jeet sakati he
 All that is needed is to remove the pressure of the past performance on foreign soil

 aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejarivalko dubai main shuukravaar ko world brands sammit main 'sabase prabhaavshaalee shaks' kaa sammaan diya gaya
 After this, he gave an explanation on his business class flight
 'aam aadmi' kii paribhaasha par apana or party kaa najariya saamne rakhte hue unhone kaha, 'aam aadmi garib aadmi nahin he
 He is the one who wants an honest system in this country
 khaas aadmi vah he jo aaj ke beyimaan system ko apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kar rahaa he or jo kabhi nahin chahta ki yah system sudhare
 He said sarcastically, "as soon as i landed here, it came to know that debates are going on in our country that i came here in business class
" main vahaan par tha nahin, varanaa main unako bataa detaa ki main bina tikat vahaan nahin baitha tha
 He said that our dream of India is that every common man should be able to travel in business class
 hamaara sapana yah nahin he ki saare bijness class waalon ko uthaa-uthaakar train main baitha den
 We want development
 gauratlab he ki kejarivalbijness class kaa hawaii safar karkedubai pahunche the
 Opposition parties created a lot of hue and cry over it
 haalanki baad main aam aadmi party ne saaf kar diya ki kejariwal ko bijness class kaa tikat us sanstha kii ore se mila tha jisane unhen sammanit kiya
 He said, 'I was returning from Banaras once
 main gaya train se or vaapasi main hawaii jahaaj se aayaa
 i was in economy class
 24 ghante channelon par chalaa ki ye to hawaii jahaaj main bhi jaataa he
 i want to clear the definition of common man
 dilli vidhansabha main bhi maine yah kaha tha
 The common man is not a poor man
 vah he jo is desh main ek eemaandaar vyavastha chahta he
 The special person is the one who is using today's unscrupulous system for his own benefit and who never wants this system to improve
 'kejariwal ke shabd the, 'greater kailash main rahane vaala amir aadmi jo system badalanaa chahta he, vah bhi aam aadmi ho saktaa he
 And a poor man who is somehow taking wrong advantage of the system is also a special man
 isliye aam aadmi garib aadmi nahin he, vah he jo eemaandaar raajnneeti chahta he
 There are a lot of you who earn money honestly
 eemaandaaree se paisa kamaane main kuch bhi galat nahin he
