 Many judges of the Supreme Court were present during this period
 tippaniyan CJI Khehar said that if the man goes out with his child then it is his choice but the woman has to get permission to go out
 aakhir purush ko ghar kaa master kyon kaha jaataa he
 Because the woman cooks for him, washes clothes, handles children
 vah uskaa or bacchon kaa puraa dhyaan rakhti he
 Celebration occurs when a boy is born but does not happen when a girl is born
 ladke ko hameshaa protocol miltaa he, jaise use pehle acha khaanaa milegaa, acchhee shiksha milegi
 This is what our children see
 ladki ko jeevanabhar kaa boj maan liya jaataa he
 He said that it is a psychological matter but also a physiological one

 sijeai khehar ne kaha ki purush agar apane bachche ke saath baahar jaataa he to yah uski marji he lekin mahila ko baahar jane ke liye ijaajat leni hoti he
 After all, why is a man called a master of the house
 kyonki mahila uske liye khaanaa banaati he, kapade dhoti he, bacchon ko sambhalati he
 She takes full care of him and the children
 jab ladke kaa janm hota he to jashn manaaya jaataa he lekin ladki ke janm par aisa nahin hota
 The boy always gets protocol, just like he would get good food first, get good education
 yahi hamaare bachche dekhte hai
 The girl is considered a burden of life
 unhone kaha ki yah ek manovaigyanik maamla he lekin ek physiological bhi he
 In a state where there is a difference in the birth rate between men and women, there is a problem of marriages
 hamane dekha he ki mahilaon se rape or chhedchhad hoti he, ve garib tabake ke log hote hai
 Because those people live in stolen electricity, stolen water and such places which they do not have
 ve privesi main nahin rahete
 People cannot change their mind just by punishment

 amar singh or jaya pradaa us sambhavit kadam ke khilaaf roak ke liye supreme court kii sharan main gaye the jo matdaan ke dauraan mahila aarakshan vidheyak ke paksh main vot daalane kii sthiti main unke khilaaf uthaaya ja saktaa tha
 The SP was strongly opposed to this bill
 november 2010 main supreme court ne donon ko raahat dete hue koi bhi karrwai karne se roak laga di thi
 The lawyers of both the mps argued that the defection law can be imposed against them only if someone in the party defies or violates the party whip
 in vakeelon kaa kahana tha ki is maamle main saansadon ne party se dalbadal nahin kiya he balki unhen nishkasit kar diya gaya he
 In such a situation, it is not necessary for him to be considered a party whip
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court had earlier sought the opinion of the Attorney General on the pleas of Singh and Jaya Prada
 donon netaaon ne maang kii thi ki sapa se nishkasana ke baad unhen sadan kii sadsyta ke liye ayogy nahin tehraaya janaa chahie
 He feared that his Parliament membership could be violated if he violated the party whip based on the 1996 decision of the apex court
 varsh 1996 main supreme court dwaara kii gai dal badal kanoon kii vyakhya ke anusaar kisi raajnneetik dal ke naam par nirvaachit yaa namit sadsy barkhaastagi ke baad bhi party ke niyantran main rahata he
 But according to both leaders, the Supreme Court's interpretation of the tenth list of the constitution violates the fundamental rights of expelled members, including equality under Article 14, 19 and 21, free speech and expression and the right to life

 donon saansadon ke vakeelon kii daleel thi ki yadi party main rahete hue koi dalbadal karata he yaa party vip kaa ulanghan karata he tabhi unke khilaaf dalbadal kanoon lagaaya ja saktaa he
 These lawyers said that the mps have not interfered with the party in this case but they have been expelled
 aise main bataur asambaddha sadsy unke liye party vip maananaa jaruri nahin he
 The comments supreme court ne singh or jaya pradaa kii yachika par isse pehle atorni general kii raay maangi thi
 Both leaders demanded that they should not be disqualified for membership of the House after their expulsion from the SP
 unhen dar tha ki sheersh adaalat ke 1996 ke faisle ko aadhaar banaakar party vip kaa ulanghan karne par unki sansad kii sadsyta ja sakati he
 According to the interpretation of the Dal Bala law made by the Supreme Court in the year 1996, the elected or nominated member in the name of a political party remains in control of the party even after the dismissal
 lekin donon netaaon ke anusaar samvidhan kii dasvin suchi kii supreme court kii vyakhya nishkasit sadasyon ke moulik adhikaron kaa atikaraman karti he, jisamen anuchhed 14, 19 evam 21 ke tahat samanta, swatantra bhaashan evam abhivyakti or jivan kaa adhikaar bhi shaamil he

 ' 'aaj tak' ne pehle aapako 2017 ke sabase bade khulaase se rou-ba-rou karaayaa
 In this, through the Hurriyat tapes, they saw the black truths of Hurriyat leaders being crushed layer by layer
 un hurriyat netaaon kii kalai khuli, jo pakistan ke pe-role par rahete hue ghati kii shanti ko palitha lagaate hai
 The impact of the Aaj Tak sting from the Valley to Delhi was felt

 After a clean sweep in the ODI series, Mahendra Singh Dhoni would now like to end his current season in the three-match T20 series against Zimbabwe starting Saturday
 vanade siries main dhoni and company ne 3-0 se jeet darj kii
 Now his goal will be to repeat this performance in the T20 series
 kedaar jadhav or manish pandey jaise khilaadi jo yahaan 2015 main tii20 siries khel chuke hai, unhen bakhubi yaad hoga ki ajinkya rahane kii aguwai vaali team doosraa match haar gai thi or siries 1-1 se drow rahi thi
 Fazal does not have IPL experience India is a strong contender for clean sweep this time in the presence of world's most experienced T20 captain
 is 15 sadasyeey team main faij fazal ko chhodkar sabhi khilaadi ipel khelte hai
 The difference in performance of both teams is so deep that Dhoni can change his batting order
 mandeep singh, jayant yadav, jayadev unadakat jaise khilaadiyon ko utaara ja saktaa he
 Dhoni's batting will be seen? Mahendra Singh Dhoni's intention will be to start by winning with such a winning combination as he is not one of the most changing captains
 dhoni ko haalanki ballebaaji kram main upar aana chahie kyonki unhen khelte dekhne kii tamanna rakhane vaale yahaan maujuud chuninda bharatiyon ko vanade siries main maayusi haath lagi jab captain ko ballebaaji kii jarurat hi nahin padi
 KL Rahul, Manish Pandey, Ambati Rayudu and Dhoni are scheduled to play in T20
 pari kii shuruyaat ke liye karun nair or fazal main se ek kaa chayan hoga
 Nair opened the innings in two odis and scored 39 runs in the second match
 fazal ne apane pehle antarrashtriya match main ardhashatak jamaaya
 Nair has consistently played well in T20 cricket
 unhone nilambit rajasthan rails or dilli dairedevills ke saath 64 macharon main 122 se adhik kii strike rate se ran banaae
 Mandeep, Kedar Jadhav will get a chance! On the other hand, Fazal, who has a strike rate of 105 in T20, has not had an IPL agreement since 2011
 punjab ke mandeep ko senior str par padaarpan kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 Similarly, Kedar Jadhav is also in the race who did not get a chance to play a single ODI
 bhartiya gendbaajon ne abhi tak anushaasit pradarshan kiya he
 Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaspreet Bumrah and Barinder Saran have been performing well
 dhoni agar saran ko aaraam dete hai to unadakat ko utaar sakate hai
 Spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Akshar Patel have also been economical
 haraare sports club maidan kii pich seem gendbaajon kii madadgaar hogi lekin ballebaajon ko bhi is par niraashaa haath nahin lagegi
 For Zimbabwe, the T20 series will be a relief as it changes the picture of the match in one or two overs

 jiesti ke lagu hote hi dilli ke bazaaron main mandi kaa alam he
 The biggest impact has been on the old big wholesale markets of Delhi
 jahaan se desh bhar ke retaillers kharidari karne aate hai
 In terms of fashion, Delhi competes with other countries of the world
 yahaan har din bazaaron main nayaa trend dekhne ko miltaa he
 Which is copied by youth across the country
 lekin jiesti lagu hone ke baad na to nayaa maal ban rahaa he, or naa hi holsaler kharid rahe hai
 The situation is that the markets are filled with stock only about a month old
 agar aisa hi haal bana rahaa to dilli fishan ke maamle main pichad jaaegi
 Which will have a direct impact on the youth, who are crazy about new fashion trends
 kyon pad rahaa he bazaaron par asar- bazaaron se kharidaar nadaarat- kharidaar na hone kii vajah se saamaanon ke production main kami ai he
 - One month old markets are full of stock of fashion trends
 - har din badalte fishan ke daur main bazaaron main kharidaar nahin hone se holcel dilers ko har din lakhon ke nuksaan kaa boj uthaanaa pad rahaa he

 Vihaan is famous for planning and full proof strategy for the mission
 sargical strike mishan ko puraa karne ke baad vihaan army life se ritair hona chahta he kyonki uski maa ko uski jarurat he
 Then Rajit Kapoor, who was seen in the role of PM Modi, reminded Vihaan that "desh bhi hai hamari hai"
 movie kaa second half sargical strike kii planning or ection par focus karata he
 The audience is fully aware of the story and climax of Uri, despite how the army carries out this operation, it is interesting to see it on screen
 iske liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Why should a film be seen? Uri is a film full of patriotism
 movie ke dialog shandaar hai
 In a dialogue, Vihaan shouts, "they want Kashmir and we their heads
" '' uri ek decent film he
 The action scenes of the movie have become strong
 golibari ke alaava movie main laat-ghuson kaa ection bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 Vicky Kaushal did a good job in the action sequence
 actor ne har seen main behtareen kaam kiya he
 His hard work for the film is clearly visible
 film pink main najar ain kirti kulhari ke khate main zyada kuch nahin aayaa
 Yami Gautam's work is good
 tivi actor mohit raina ne bhi acha kaam kiya he
 The film has managed to hold on till the end
 kya he film kii kamjor kadiyaan?bharat or pakistan ke seen main antar saaf taur par najar aata he
 The flag of Pakistan is kept to show the scene of Islamabad
 second part ke mukaable film kaa first half zyada strong he
 It seems as if the makers have forgotten the essence of the story after the interval
 isse nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki movie main raajnneetik prachaar saaf najar aata he
 The release of the movie reflects the political agenda for 2019

 In response to a question about Rahul Gandhi during a press conference on Wednesday, he said that Rahul Gandhi has treated this whole issue like a 'political juvenile'

 Now we have to do so much work in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to give an example

 lalit par teen hatyaon sahit kul 10 maamle alag-alag thanon main darj he
 (input from IANS) hardik patel chah maheene gujarat se baahar rahane ke baad aaj waapas aa rahe hai
 Now everyone will be eyeing whether they will be able to revive the reservation movement
 
 
 gujarat main aage unki kya hogi ranneeti
 
 
 Aaj Tak's gossip Gopi Ghanghar had a special conversation with Hardik Patel about this
 
 
 hardik, ab aapaki kya planning he?planning to yahi he ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar logo ko jaagrit karnaa he
 The battle of reservation which has been fought for the last 18 months has to be taken forward
 jati ke aadhaar par jo logaarakshan maangate hai, un par deshadroh ke aarope laga die jate hai, yuvaaon kii hatya karnaa, mahilaon ko maarna, ye sari chijen andolan ko dabaane kii niti ke tahat hai

 Is the Prime Minister responsible for this? When we started the reservation movement for the Patidars, they went to America and said that the Patidars will get justice
 pichley 20 saal se hamane bhaajapa ko sab kuch diya he, lekin jab hamen jarurat padi to bhaajapa ne hamen kuch nahi diya
 There is an attempt to deliberately suppress the issue through Narendra Modi
 ve jaanate hai ki sahi or galat kya he, phir bhi wo bol nahi rahe hai
 He runs his government on the ideology of the Sangh, he himself goes here and there for his justice
 main maanata hum ki agar is andolan kaa faisla jald ho jaae to ham bhi apane kaam main lag jaaenge

 What will Gujarat politics be like from today? We are fighting in front of those who have oppressed us, be it government, system or any person

 We have been on strike for a week now

 com / tpvliqc2szisa par pashchim bengal ke mantri raazib banerjee (rajib Banerjee) ne kaha ki company ko kisi bhi vyakti ko apane dharm ke khilaaf jane ke liye majaboor nahin karnaa chahie
 this is wrong
 ab jab mujhe is sambandh main jaankaree mili he, to main is maamle ko dekhuunga
 Let us know that earlier a customer of Zomato had canceled the food because the delivery boy was Muslim
 usne kisi hindu delivery boy ko bhejne ko kaha or baad main usne order cancil kar diya
 After which Jomato gave such a response, which was liked by people on social media
 jabalpur ke amit shukla ne twit karte hue likhaa tha- 'maine jomato kaa order cancil kar diya he
 They gave my food to the Muslim rider and also said that they cannot change the rider and will not refund the money
 'iske badjiske baad jomato ke founder deepinder goyal ne twit karte hue likhaa tha- 'hamen bharat ke vichaar par garv he or hamaare sammanit graahakon or bhagidaaron kii vividhta
 We do not regret losing any business that gets in the way of our values

 ek maa apane khoe hue bete ko paane kii liye har dargah va mandir main mannate maangati rahi
 One day it came to know that his tenant who has been living in his house for twenty days is his child Raju
 maa ne apane saat saal se khoe bete kii talash deshbhar main kii vahiin bete ne bhi maa se milane ke liye kya-kya sitam nahin saha
 This story of the meeting of mother and son is a complete film, but the reality is that you will also be shocked to hear
 maa ne har jagah maangi duabihar ke begusarai jile ke phulabadiya thana ke ganj tole kii shabana parveen or uske bete raju kii bichhadne va milane kii kehani filmi he
 Actually, in June 2009, Raju went to the Mundan ceremony for a child of his neighbor, from where he suddenly disappeared
 kaaphi khojbin ke baad bhi uskaa pataa nahi chalaa, tab jaakar falvadiyaa thaan main gumshudagi kaa maamla darj karaayaa gaya
 His mother kept searching for Raju, asking for vows from Ajmer in several temple-mosques including Haji Dargah in Mumbai, but he could not be found
 laapata hone ke saat saal baad janvari 2017 main parveen ko raju apane ghar main hi mil gaya
 Unable to recognize the mother, the renter auto driver Mohammed Armaan of Raju was found wandering in Raju Barauni and demanded to give him work
 kaam milane ke baad vah uske saath uske ghar main rahane laga
 Suddenly one day Parveen saw Raju while drinking tea, she recognized him, but Raju could not recognize his mother
 parveen ne use photo elbum dikhaaya or bachapan ke doston ko dikhaaya tab jaakar use yaad aayaa or usne apni maa ko pahchaan liya
 The story of Raharaju's wandering at the stations is very painful
 raju bataata he ki use muden ke dauraan kuch log jabaran uthaakar le gaye or use sui va dawa dekar rakhaa jaataa tha
 The kidnapper called him his son
 raju dhire dhire sabakuch bhul gaya or usee dampatti ko apana maa-baap maan liya
 After four years while playing outside, he was told by a friend that his parents speak falsely, he was brought from somewhere
 iske baad raju vahaan se bhaag gaya
 All he remembered was that his house was near the railway station
 teen saal se vah railway stesan ke aas paas gaanv ko khojataa rahaa
 In the search of home, Raju was not able to find a house at night in many stations including Banaras, Allahabad, Bhatni, Deoria
 is dauraan jab use pet kii aag bujhaani hoti to kisi hotel yaa chaay kii dukaan main kaam pakad letaa or kuch din kaam karne ke baad phir vah ghar kii talash main nikal jaataa
 One day he reached Barauni and met Armaan and started working with him on a daily basis of 50 rupees
 raju apane maa ke ghar hi kirayedar ke yahaan rah rahaa tha, lekin vahaan ghar or mohalle kii banaavat badal jane se pahchaan nahin paa rahaa tha
 After meeting, Parveen reminded him by showing him from the photo album for two days
 ab dono milakar kaaphi khush hai
 The mother was identified by her son who had been missing as a tenant in her own house for 5 years
 kahani filmi he par he hakeekat
 Here the police has told Raju to take further action by making a statement of 164 in the court
 espi ranjit kumaar mishra ne bataaya ki 2009 se laapata raju waapas aa gaya he
 Legal action will be taken based on his statement

 The last league match of the World Cup is being played between Pakistan and Ireland in Adelaide
 isi muqaabale se tay hoga ki pakistan world cap main bana rahegaa yaa baahar ho jayega
 India and South Africa have already qualified for the quarter-finals from Group B
 antim do tiimon ke liye muqaabala westeindies, pakistan or ireland ke bich hona he
 The three teams currently have 6-6 points
 westeindies ne nepier main khele gaye muqaabale main sanyukt arab emirate ko 6 wicket se haraaya or net ran rate main behatar hone kii badaulat group bi main tisare number par pahunch gaya he
 That is, the fourth team in Group b is to be decided in Pakistan and Ireland
 agar pakistan ireland ko haraa detaa he, to group bi se pakistan or westeindies quarter final main jagah banane main kaaymab ho jaaegi
 West Indies and Ireland will still have 6-6 points but West Indies will reach the last 8 based on net run rate
 lekin agar ireland, pakistan ko haraa de, to phir pakistan ke liye aage kii raah mushkil ho jaaegi
 Because the net run rate of West Indies looks better than Pakistan
 yani pakistan ke liye har haal main jeet hasil karnaa jaruri he
 In the manner in which Ireland's captain William Porterfield is batting, Pakistan faces a tough challenge
 lekin pakistan ke ballebaaz ko yahaan koi bhi chunauti ko aasaan bananaa hoga
 Misbah ul Haq, Ahmed Shehzad, Sarfaraz Ahmed and Shahid Afridi will have to overcome Ireland's challenge
 vaise agar ye match dilachasp andaaj main taai yaa phir donon tiimon ke bich 1-1 ank kaa bantwaaraa hota he to phir westeindies apane aap baahar ho jaaegi
 Therefore, the West Indies camp will want the result of this match in any case
 pakistan isse pehle 1979, 2003 or 2007 ke world cap main group stage se baahar ho chukaa he
 At the same time, Ireland's team is trying to enter the quarter-finals for the first time
 maharashtra main devendra fadanvis ko chupchaap shapath grahan karaane ko lekar shivasena ne rajyapal par mangalvaar ko hamalaa bolaa
 The party said that while one Bhagat Singh was hanged for freedom, the other 'hanged' democracy in the dark of night
 ' shivasena ne apane mukhpatr ‘saamana' main prakashit sampadakeey main poocha ki '162 vidhayakon' kii yahaan ek hotel main sanyukt parade karaane ke baad shivasena-rakanpa-congress kii taraf se sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ke liye saunpe jane vaale patr par rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari kaa kya rukh hoga

 yah parade yah dikhaane ke liye kii gai ki 288 sadasyeey sadan main uske paas bahumat hasil he

 shivasena ne poocha, 'jab hamane saaf sanket de diya ki shivasena-rakanpa-congress gathbandhan ke paas 162 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he to rajyapal dwaara pichley hafte devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar ko kramash: mukhyamantri or upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke liye bulaane kaa kya aadhaar tha?' marathi patr main kaha gaya, 'ham ek bhagat singh ko jaanate hai jo desh kii aazaadee ke liye faansee ke takhte par chadh gaye, lekin is duusare bhagat singh ne loktantr evam aazaadee ko muhar (unke hastakshar) ke jariye aadhi raat ko suuli par taang diya
 Along with this, the party also targeted NCP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar who rebelled against his party last week and supported BJP to form the government in the state
 shivasena ne kaha ki rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar ne do baar congress ko choda or apni khud kii ek alag party chalaai or 50 varsh se zyada raajnneeti main sakriy rahe
 The Uddhav Thackeray-led party said, 'ajit Pawar should have done something similar instead of stealing papers and falsely claiming support of NCP mlas
 ' party ne aarope lagaaya ki jis kshan bhaajapa ne pravartan nideshaalay kii jaanch ke naam par ajit pavaar ko 'blackmel' kiya, unhone apane chachaa sharad pavaar kii raajnneetik dharohar ko todane kaa prayaas kiya
 The editorial said, "he used the old letter to claim the support of NCP mlas
" ' isamen kaha gaya, 'ajit pavaar ne khud kai maukon par kaha he ki vah jhooth nahin bolte
 The same Pawar is now lying every day and he submitted a fake letter to the Governor to claim the support of his party mlas
 ' marathi dainik main kaha gaya ki jis kisi ke paas bahumat hasil ho vah sarkaar bana saktaa he, lekin yah samvidhan evam sthapit niyamon ko puri tarah 'dhwast' kar ke nahin kiya janaa chahie nahin to logon ko aisi sansthaaon main bharosa nahin rah jayega
 The Shiv Sena expressed confidence that the 'maha Vikas Aghadi', a coalition formed between the Uddhav Thackeray-led party, NCP and the Congress after the election, would prove its majority in the House

 ) Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has targeted the congress-ncp and the Shiv Sena for changing the Protem Speaker in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha he ki gupt rup se sadan ko kyon bulaayaa ja rahaa he
 Why the Protem Speaker is being changed against the rules
 abhi tak vidhayakon par kyon shaq kiya ja rahaa he? vidhayakon ko abhi tak kyon chipaaya ja rahaa he? aapako bataa den ki devendra fadanvis ne twit kar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He further said that instead of discussing the help of farmers in the first cabinet, the new government was consulted to prove the majority by protecting everyone from the eyes
 kya is sarkaar ke paas bahumat he to gupt rup se sadan ko kyon bulaayaa gaya he
 Let us tell you that senior NCP leader Dilip Valse Patil was appointed as the provisional Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on Friday
 vah bijepi ke kalidas columbukar kii jagah lenge jinhen vidhayakon ko shapath dilaane ke dauraan purv main asthaayee adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Patil has also been the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in the past
 In the first Cabinet Meeting of new government, yesterday, they chose to discuss how to prove majority secretly, instead of discussing on how assistance & relief can be given to farmers suffering from unseasonal rains
 If this government has majority
 
 
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav me bijepi ko 105, shivasena ko 56, ensipi ko 54 or congress ko 44 siten mili hai
 The BJP and Shiv Sena together crossed the 145 mark
 lekin shivasena ne 50-50 formule kii maang rakh di jiske mutabik dhai-dhai saal sarkaar chalaane kaa model tha
 Shiv Sena says that the agreement with BJP was done on this formula but BJP claims that no such agreement was reached
 isi lekar matbhed itnaa badha ki donon partiyon kii 30 saal puraani dosti tut gai
 After this, after several rounds of meetings, the congress-ncp and Shiv Sena decided to form a government headed by Uddhav Thackeray and on Saturday, the three parties were going to Raj Bhavan to stake claim
 lekin bijepi ne raat main hi ajit pavaar se milakar baaji palat di or subah 8 baje hi siem devendra fadanvis ne shapath le lee unke saath ajit pavaar dipti siem ban gaye
 
 
 then why are they secretly calling the house? Why efforts to change the Pro-tem Speaker, going against the rules? Why still doubt your own mlas so much? Why are they still hiding them? renuka choudhary kaa naam congress party kii tej tarraar netaaon main shaamil he
 Renuka entered politics in 1984

 bharat or brazil jaise deshon par iskaa asar saaf najar aa rahaa he
 When asked about Jirjiva's statement, the Union Minister said, "the Monetary Fund's estimate of India is still incomplete

 We never said that we will give government job to everyone
 " unhone kaha, "kuch log sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha banaakar berogari ke mudde par logon ko gumraah karne kaa kaam kar rahe hai

 Everything is not going well in the ruling Congress and JDS alliance in the state and there is a possibility that the government may fall anytime

 The congress-jds alliance is trying to show that there is no threat to the government and the BJP is trying to sabotage their (congress) mlas

 bollywood actress priyanka chopra in dinon bharat-pakistan main charchaa main vishay bani hui hai
 Pakistan has demanded the removal of Priyanka Chopra from UNICEF as un's Goodwill Ambassador for Peace
 iske baad kangana ranut, javed akhtar or ayushmaan khurana ne priyanka chopra kaa saport kiya he
 Now the UNICEF spokesman has also given a statement on this issue
 UNICEF ke pravaktaa Stephane Dujarric ne kaha- '"jab unicef ke gudwil ambesders apni vyaktigat kshamta main bolte hai, to ve un muddon ke bare main bolne kaa adhikaar rakhte hai jo unki ruchi or chintaa se jude hote hai
 His personal views and actions do not affect UNICEF
 jab ve unicef kii taraf se bolte hai tab ham unase ummid karte hai ki ve unicef kii nishpaksh niti par adig rahe
 Explaining the role of unicef's Goodwill Ambassadors, he said, "UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors are important people who volunteer their time and their public profiles to promote children's rights
" ''ye sara vivaad haal hi main tab shuru hua jab ek event main pakistan kii ek mahila ne priyanka chopra par balakot main bharat kii airstrike par riect karne kii vajah se sawaal uthaae
 After this, Pakistan's human rights minister, Dr
 Shirin M
 Mazari, also wrote a letter to the executive director of UNICEF
 khat main yuan kii gudwil ambesder for pis ke pad ke lihaaj se priyanka ke stand kii aalochana kii gai
 In fact, Priyanka had written the tricolor emoji while writing Jai Hind on Balakot Airstrike
 actress ke isi twit se pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he
 What was written in the letter? Shirin m Mazari wrote in a letter to UNICEF - "priyanka has publicly endorsed the current situation of the Indian government
 itnaa hi nahin actress ne bharat ke raksha mantri dwaara pakistan ko di gai newclear kii dhamkee kaa saport kiya he
 All this is against the principles of peace and harmony
 kashmir par antarrashtriya sandhiyon kaa ulanghan karne ko lekar modi sarkaar ko priyanka samarthan de rahi hai
 All this undermines Priyanka's credibility on the position given to her in the UN
 agar priyanka ko jald se jald pad se nahin hataaya gaya to ye vaishvik str par yuan gudwil ambesder ko hi haasyaaspad bana degaa

 manish tiwari ke sawaal kaa jawaab Mayawati has made it clear that in order to remain in the battle of existence, she has prepared the path
 beshak rajyasabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party kaa samarthan unke iklaute ummidavaar ke liye sanjivani nahin ban paaya
 But Mayawati is thinking far this time
 isliye akhilesh yadav ke bare main unka najariya mulaayam se bilkul alag he
 Actually Bua has decided that the nephew will remain the brotherhood, even though the BSP candidate lost in the Rajya Sabha elections, even though the Samajwadi Party missed out on a return gift to the BSP on the victories of Gorakhpur and Phulpur
 lekin buaa-bhattije kii jugalbandi par jindabad jari rahegi
 On Saturday, seeing the different style of Mayawati, it became clear that she is not ready to give wickets at all
 isaki jagah mayawati ek-ek ran jodakar bada score khadaa karne vaali pari khel rahi hai
 His coming to press conferences and favoring the Samajwadi Party in a very clear manner is proving that Behenji is thinking about 2019

 But for the sake of relationship with Samajwadi Party, Mayawati has agreed to bury her heartache for the moment
 bispi-espi ke rishte kii is nai chemistry main akhilesh bhi fevicol phent rahe hai
 Here, as soon as Mayawati got angry about the relationship with Raja Bhaiya, Akhilesh deleted a tweet praising Raja Bhaiya, and a new tweet praising Bua was released instead, 'I welcome Mayawati ji's perspective
 ham raashtra nirmaan ke unke mishan main puri majbootee se saath hai
 'it is clear from Mayawati's batting planning that she will not lose wickets on bjp's googly
 gorakhpur- phulpur kaa formula aage bhi jari rahegaa
 Because BSP will not exist outside this formula
 ye wo acchhee tarah samaj chuki hai
 The alliance with Akhilesh is the last antibiotic from which bsp's health may return

 " bharat ke mobile phone bazaar main jabardast jang chhid gai he or desi companiyaan teji se aage bad rahi hai
 Although the Indian mobile phone manufacturer Micromax is still in second place, it is filling its gap
 yani thode samay main vah desh kii number van mobile phone nirmaataa company bhi ban sakati he
 According to market research firm IDC, the ranking of the first five companies in India could see an upheaval in the next quarter
 aisa isliye sambhav ho saktaa he ki bhartiya or chini companiyaan bahut hi aakraamak dhang se apane handset bech rahi hai or bazaar par apni pakad majboot karti ja rahi hai
 These companies are selling cheaply priced smartphones on a large scale and are gaining popularity
 idisi ke mutabik, samsung ab bhi bharat main pehle number kii company he or uskaa varchasv bana hua he lekin micromax ne use jabardast takkar di he
 Jaydeep Mehta, Vice President, South Asia, IDC, said that to maintain its position Samsung would have to offer a tremendous product
 is timahi main mobile bazaar main samsung kaa hissaa 17 fisadi kaa rahaa he jabaki isaki pichhali timahi main yah 20 fisadi tha
 On the other hand, the share of Indian company Micromax has increased from 13 per cent to 14 per cent
 smartphone bazaar main samsung abhi kaaphi aage he or pichhali timahi main uske paas bazaar kaa 29 fisadi rahaa jabaki uske pehle yah 35 fisadi tha
 Micromax, which was earlier with 15 percent, remains in second place with 18 percent share in the previous quarter
 ek anya bhartiya company carbon kaa bazaar hissaa girtaa hi ja rahaa he jabaki lava kaa hissaa sthir he or vah bazaar ke 6 pratishat hisse ke saath chauthe sthaan par he

 desh main har bachche ko shiksha kaa adhikaar he
 There is also a provision of free education under Right to Education (RTE)
 samvidhan kii taraf se baqayada ise moulik adhikaron main shumaar kiya gaya he
 But it seems that till now these rights are only recorded on paper
 upi ke bulandshahr ke skool kii kahani to yahi bataati he
 The schools here are telling a new story of the plight of education
 jin haathon main kitaab honi chahie thi, unheen masuumon ke haathon main kachra, jhaadu he
 Children are forced into forced labor instead of education, is it not child labor? The dirt of the school is cleaned by the hands that had to shape their future
 jo haath bade hokar desh kii gaadi khinchate, wo aaj yahaan skool kaa rickshaw khinch rahe hai
 Not only this, the brother of the head of the area is seen blowing bidi in school in front of the children
 ve skool main masterji kii kursi par baithkar bacchon ko dhumrapaan kii shiksha baantate hue dikhte hai
 This mockery of the right to education is being ridiculed in a primary government school in Bulandshahr, UP
 lekin aisi kahani kamobesh har jagah kii he
 In the name of studies, these two annihilations were also told on messing up the lives of children
 ek ko aisa kuch bhi nahin dikhaa or duusari ko majaburi hi dikhti he bas
 By the way, the teachers of the school were not expecting a better answer than this, when the basic education minister of UP is engaged in counting the helplessness then what to say next
 ab is system se shiksha kii ummid kya karen jo majaburiyon kaa thikra bhi masuumon ke sir par hi phodte hai
 By the way, those who run the system must still be pushing their backs that even if they are not able to teach, they have given the rights
 jab tak shiksha mili, tab tak is adhikaar se hi kaam chalaa lijie

 Sachin's tweet on Kohli's bat, wrote- Good, this stain shoharat kuch logon ke mukaddar main hoti he
 One such kid, rich in mukaddar, was running on the railway platform about twenty years ago
 wo ro rahaa tha, kyonki uskaa jigari dost bichad rahaa tha
 This scene was of a film
 us film kaa kalakaar baccha ab bada ho chukaa he
 This child has now grown up and today he has become not just an actor but a cricketer and he is also one of the brightest stars in the country
 bhartiya cricket kaa chamakdaar sitaraye kahani bhi badi dilachasp he
 Actually, his father took that child to the acting platform, but later an old dream came alive in the father's eyes and he took his actor son away from the lights-camera and took him to a new ground of action
 plateform par daudta choti umr se hi daudta rahaa, daudta rahaa or daudta rahaa
 This race was on the floor, but the floor was not found on the big screen but on the cricket field
 is bachche kaa naam he yuvaraj singh, bhartiya cricket kaa chamakdaar sitara
 Father's dreams changed: In his desire to become a platformfilm star, Yuvraj Singh's platform, which went into acting since childhood, changed the father's dreams
 ye platfarm tha cricket kaa jahaan yuvaraj ek karishme kii tarah chamake-damake auki acting kahin peeche chhot gayi
 Today the crown of Yuvraj rings in the cricket field
 team india kii badi ummid hai yuvaraj
 Yuvraj is the machine of the run and is proud to snatch the victory by tearing the neck of the necklace, but the taste of acting which he used to do in his childhood continues to hiccup
 shaayad isiliye jab kabhi acting kaa mauka haath lagata he yuvaraj apana rang dikhaa jate hai, mukaable main chaahe baliwood kaa badshaah hi kyon naa ho
 Full Time Cricketer Part Time Acting: There is an artist in Yuvraj who is still alive
 acchhee kad-lathi, dher sari shoharat or viraasat main mili adaakaari
 It was enough to make the cricketer Yuvraj a film star, but Papa Yograj Singh showed the red flag before the offers came out
 unhone saaf kah diya ki yuvaraj ko abhi sirf cricket khelnaa he
 If you want to fulfill your passion for acting, then after 40 years all the age is lying
 lekin maa ke laadle yuvaraj ne pita ke anushaasan main rahete hue bhi manamaani karne kaa koi mauka jane nahin diya
 Despite being a full-time cricketer, he enjoys acting and partnering with stars in part time

 So either i have to catch balls or play with the bat instead of my gloves
 perth main duusari pari se pehle maine training ke dauraan ballebji kii or mujhe acha mahasoos ho rahaa tha
 Catching is a different thing, i always apply tape on my fingers during training
