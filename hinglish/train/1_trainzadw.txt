 At the same time, Swaraj Abhiyan, the party of the leaders separated from AAP, has targeted the Aam Aadmi Party
 swaraj abhiyaan ne kaha ki aap vidhayakon kaa aise kaamon main lipt hona durbhagyapurna he
 Swaraj Abhiyan said that similar complaints of party leaders are also coming up in Punjab
 yogendra yadav ne kaha ki 'jis makasad se alag raajnneeti kii baat aam aadmi party karti thi wo vifal sabit ho rahi he
 After receiving such complaints, there was no difference between Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party

 Gupta said that the women welfare minister herself has crossed all limits of immorality by implicating women in sex scandals
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal or sisodiya jaldi kaarywahi karne par bina shame apni peeth thapthapa rahe hai
 But no minister who has been tainted till date has been removed from the party
 farji degree vaale tomars, rishwat lene vaale aasim or mahilaon kaa apmaan karne vaale somnath ke khilaaf party level par koi kaarywahi nahin hui he
 Now all corrupt ministers including women welfare ministers who exploit women should show the way out

 Maken said by tweeting that 3 out of 6 ministers of Aam Aadmi Party have proved to be tainted, who made those ministers involved in fake degrees, corruption and immoral work? Maken also asked Kejriwal what the compulsion is, because of which Kejriwal has not removed people with fake degrees and corruption

 But Kejriwal's stance and then statement made it clear that the impact of this entire drama on him was positive

 Arvind Kejriwal, in his familiar style, called every party's mistake a conspiracy of opponents and claimed the Akali Dal to wipe out the state
 manthan karenge kejarivashravind kejariwal do din ludhiana main party ke kaaryakartaaon or netaaon se manthan karenge ki aakhir kaise aap ko is sthiti se baahar nikaala jaae

 There will be a challenge and some will complete Navjot Singh Sidhu who is separated from BJP

 a photo posted by Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) on May 8, 2016 at 1:11am PDT The Government of India has decided to adopt a 'wait and see' strategy for the next three-four months before deciding on the disinvestment of Air India
 isse pehle 2 baar hissedari bechney kii samaysima badhaane ke baad bhi sarkaar ko is sambandh main koi aavedan nahin mila tha
 According to a senior official, the government generally believes that Care India should remain in the hands of a domestic body
 unhone kaha, 'hamane agle teen-chaar maheene tak pratiksha karo or dekho (air india ke viniveshper) kii ranneeti apnaane kaa nirnay liya he
 He further said that fuel prices are high now and we have to decide on the affordability of the decision to move forward with the disinvestment process
 adhikari ne kaha, 'mukhyat: eendhan kii adhik keemton ke kaaran abhi puraa vimaanan kshetra sankat kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 The offer to sell government stake in Air India could not get any primary bid till May 31, the last date of tender
 sarkaar ne rashtriya vimaanan company main 76 pratishat equity share puunji kii bikri kaa faisla kiya he
 According to the initial information memorandum, control of the management of Air India will also be given to the private company
 is saude ke tahat air india ke alaava uski kam laagat vaali ikai air india express or air india eseties orport services privet limited kii bhi bikri kii jaaegi
 The pre-determined deadline for the Letter of Interest (EOI) for the strategic disinvestment of Air India was 14 May
 baad main sarkaar ne ioai jamaa karne kii taarikh badhaakar 31 may kar diya tha, lekin tab bhi koi khariddaar nahin mila
 The government will retain a 24 percent stake in the airline
 28 march ko jari gyaapan ke anusaar boli jeetne vaali company ko kam se kam 3 saal tak airline main apane nivesh ko kaayam rakhana hoga
 By the end of March 2017, the airline had incurred a total debt burden of Rs 48,000 crore
 sachin tendulkar, jaak kallis, muthya muralidharan or riki ponting isvishv kapako apane liye yaadgaar banane kii puri koshish karenge kyonki yah aakhri mauka ho saktaa he jabaki unhen cricket mahakumbh main apana jalawaa dikhaane kaa avasar milegaa
 Sri Lankan spinner Muralitharan (38 years) has already announced that he will say goodbye to international cricket after this tournament
 bhartiya star ballebaaj tendulkar (37), dakshin africa alrounder kallis (35) or austrailian captain riki ponting (36) kaa bhi 2015 ke vishwa cap main khilne kii sambhaavna nahin ke baraabar he
 Ponting (1999, 2003 and 2007, the last two of which he captained in the World Cup) and Muralitharan (1996) have previously been part of the World Champion team, but would like to lift the coveted trophy again
 javed miyadaad ke lagaataar chah vishwa cap main khilne ke ricard kii barabari karne ke kagaar par khadey tendulkar ne test or van de main kai uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai lekin vah nahin chahenge ki unke naam par ek baar bhi khitaab jite bina sarvaadhik vishwa cap khilne kaa ricard darj ho
 Kallis has also never been a member of the World Champion team in his career
 choton ko dekhte hue bhartiya tej gendbaaj jahir khan (jo 2015 tak 36 saal ke ho jaaenge) bhi ho saktaa he ki agle vishwa cap kii team main shaamil nahin ho paaen
 Shoaib Akhtar (35), Test captain misbah-ul-haq (36) and former captain Younis Khan (34), who are troubled by injuries in the Pakistani team, are also expected to play their last World Cup
 westeindies kii team aise khilaadiyon main kris gail (31), shivnarayan chandrapal (36) or ramanaresh sarwan (30) kaa naam liya ja saktaa he
 England's captain Andrew Strauss (33) and Paul Collingwood (34) are also set to play in their last World Cup
 newjiland kii team main captain danniel vittori, alrounder scot styris or jaikab oram sambhavat: 2015 main blike caps kii team main nahin rahenge
 One day before the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, the Rafale controversy came out again and now it can also hold political stalemate
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko narendra modi sarkaar ko tagada jhatka dete hue centre kii daleelon ko khaarij karte hue raksha mantralay se li hue dastavejon kii vaidhata ko manjuuri de di he
 After this decision of the court in the election season, the opposition may once again attack the center
 desh kii sheersh adaalat ne buudhvaar ko rafel maamle par sunwaayee karte hue raksha mantralay se li hue dastavejon kii vaidhata ko manjuuri de di jisase is cese par phir se sunwaayee kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 According to the court's decision, now these documents will be part of the hearing in the Supreme Court
 saath hi court ne yaha bhi kaha ki vah rafel par punarvichaar yachikaaon kii sunwaayee ke liye taarikh tay karegaa
 After this decision of the court, the Congress and opposition parties, who have been attacking the BJP government at the Center for a long time on the Rafale Deal, have the opportunity to raise the issue again
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi lambey samay se saarvajanik manchon se piem modi par rafel deal ko lekar nishaanaa sadhate rahe hai
 The Supreme Court's decision came at a time when Congress President Rahul Amethi is about to file his nomination for the Lok Sabha elections and the first phase of voting is to take place in the country a day later
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan rafel kaa maamla garmaae rahane ke asaar ban gaye hai
 Arun Shourie, who was present in the court at the time of the verdict, said that the court had accepted the allegations we had made
 bhrashtachar par bahes kii chunautirafel deal par rahul gandhi lagaataar pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa karte rahe hai
 Rahul has again challenged Prime Minister Modi to debate corruption
 rahul gandhi ne mangalvaar ko twit kar kaha tha ki priy pradhanmantri, kya aap bhrashtachar par mere saath bahes karne se dar rahe hai? main aapke liye yah aasaan kar detaa hum
 You can prepare on these topics by opening a book: 1
 rafel+anil ambani 2
 Nirav Modi 3
 amit shah+notebandi
 Earlier on April 7, Rahul Gandhi also tweeted on Prime Minister Modi, 'you can run but you can't hide
 aapkaa karm peechha nahin chhodega
 Truth is very powerful
 main modiji ko bhrashtachar par bahes kii chunauti detaa hum
 Then, on the challenge given by Rahul Gandhi, BJP had attacked that the Congress President is an oblivious leader
 is bich supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit kar narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'modi ji har jagah kah rahe the ki unhen supreme court se rafel main clin chit mili he
 Today's Supreme Court verdict proves that Modi ji has stolen in Rafael, betrayed the country's army and misled the Supreme Court to hide his crime
 'modi ji har jagah kah rahe the ki unhen supreme court se rafel main clin chit mili he
 Today's Supreme Court verdict proved that Modi ji had stolen in Rafael, betrayed the army of the country and misled the Supreme Court to hide his crime

 co / 9dup2bpenq — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) April 10, 2019 The objections of the central government are being heard in the malicious Supreme Court by a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi
 isse pehle chif justise ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne yachikakartaon se 15 march ko hui sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha tha ki wo rafel deal ke dastavej li hone se judi praathmik aapattiyon par focus karen
 a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph had said that the fact investigation would be done in the matter only after the government has decided on the initial objections raised
 centre sarkaar ne court main daawa kiya tha ki france ke saath rafel ladaaku vimaan saude se jude dastavejon ko visheshadhikaar praapt bataaya or kaha tha ki bhartiya sakshya adhinium kii dhara 123 ke anusaar in dastavejon ko saboot nahin mana ja saktaa
 Attorney General KK Venugopal, who appeared in the court on behalf of the Center, said that no one can present them in the court without the permission of the concerned department as these documents are also protected under the Government Secrecy Act
 soochna ke adhikaar kanoon kii dhara 8 (1) (e) ke anusaar bhi jaankaree saarvajanik karne se chhot mili hui he
 Petitioner Prashant Bhushan had argued in the Supreme Court that the objections of the central government were malicious and totally untraceable
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter ab ise mahaj ittefaq kahen yaa phir lokapal bill kaa bakheda
 It has been introduced in Parliament 8 times till date
 lekin naa jane kya baat he ki ajtak ye bill paas nahin ho paaya
 However, most of the governments that introduced it could not come back
 anna jis lokapal bill ko lekar sarkaar ke peeche pade hai, us bill kii ajeebogareeb vidambnaa he
 It may sound very strange to hear, but there is some political history of this bill, which is also very interesting and a bit scary for the government
 halaki, ye sab mahaj ittefaq ho saktaa he
 Nor do these things have any scientific basis
 phir bhi ye ek rochak raajnneetik ghatnakram he ki jisane bhi is bill ko chuaa, uski sarkaar mushkil main fansi
 Have a look at the fight so far with the Lokpal
 1968main indira gandhi ke samay bill loksabhaa main paas hua par kanoon nahin ban paaya
 Bell was reintroduced in 1971 but the bill lapsed due to dissolution of the Lok Sabha
 1977main morarji desai kii sarkaar ne ise pesh kiya
 But the Lok Sabha was dissolved before it was given to the Standing Committee
 isse pehle hi morarji piem se hat chuke the
 Rajiv Gandhi introduced the bill in Parliament in 1985 but his government was not formed in 1989
 1989main veepi singh ne bill sansad main pesh kiya
 But first he went to the chair and then the Ninth Lok Sabha was dissolved
 1996main devgauda ne bill sansad main rakhaa par par bill paas ho usase pehle hi loksabhaa bhang ho gai
 In 1998, before the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government could see the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee regarding this bill, his government fell
 halaki 2001 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne bill ko stading cameti ko phir se refer kiya
 But the Lok Sabha was dissolved before the bill was passed and Vajpayee's government could not return
 saaf he ki jis sarkaar ne bhi sansad main ye bill rakhaa usamen se zyaadaatar dobaaraa chuni nahin gai
 Now you do not know when this idea came in the year 1963, the law will be made
 pakistan ke raashtrapati parvaiz musharraf ke kilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav par somvaar se kaarywahi shuru hone ja rahi he
 The leaders of the ruling coalition in Islamabad have also prepared a charge sheet against Musharraf to initiate the process in the National Assembly
 342 sadasyeey nichle sadan kii somvaar shaam paanch baje satr ke liye baithak hogi
 It is expected to decide the fate of 64-year-old Musharraf
 musharraf par aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he ki unhone kai baar samvidhan kaa ulanghan kiya he or america se milane vaali karodon dollar kii sahaayta kaa durupyog bhi kiya he
 a comprehensive chargesheet against Musharraf, including violations of the Constitution and other laws and misappropriation of US aid of millions of dollars, has been finalized
 yah aarope patr sansad main mahabhiyog prastaav ke saath hi pesh kiya jayega
 The ruling leaders have said before the impeachment proceedings begin that the President should resign immediately from his post
 lekin musharraf pehle hi yah kah chuke hai ki vah istipha nahin denge
 He has also refused to dissolve the Parliament to avoid the crisis on his own
 vidhi mantri faruk nayak ne kaha ki ham aisa aaropapatr taiyaar karenge ki aage or adhik jaanch kii jarurat na ho
 After Musharraf's reply, the House can pass a motion to impeach him
 piemail-en ke varisht netaa ishaak daar ne kaha ki aaropapatr vyapak hoga
 The two leaders said the chargesheet would be made public after it was presented in Parliament
 daar ne kaha ki somvaar se punjab, uttar pashchimi seemaant praant, sindh or baluchistan kii prantiy assembliyaan prastaav paarit kar musharraf se sansad main vishwaas mat hasil karne ke liye kahengi
 After the completion of this process, the process of impeachment will start in the National Assembly or lower house of Parliament
 pakistan kii sansad ke donon sadanon neshnal assembly or seenet ke sadasyon kii kul sankhya 442 he
 a two-thirds majority, ie, the support of 295 members would be needed to pass the impeachment motion

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhaajapa or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par prahaar karte hue kaha ki sirf nafrat failaane vaale in donon hi sanghathanon ke desh kii aazaadee main yogadan ke naam par bataane ke liye kuch nahin he
 He neither gave Mahatma Gandhi nor Sardar Patel to the country
 rahul ne apane amethi main yojit chunavi sabhaaon main aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi desh ko baantne or todane kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 It has become Modi's habit to fight caste with caste and religion with religion
 vah uttar pradesh main bhi yahi kar rahe hai
 Referring to the song 'naam banega banega na musleman banega, Insane ki aulad hai insane banega', he said that Modi will never be able to create a Hindustan with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideology
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki desh kii aazaadee main avismaraneey yogadan karne vaale mahapurushon main se kisi kaa bhi vaasta bhaajapa yaa sangh se nahin tha
 Be it Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel or Bhagat Singh
 bhaajapa or sangh ke paas bataane ke liye kuch nahin he
 Referring to Sardar Patel, he said that Modi should not do the work of distributing great personalities for party politics
 rahul ne pradhanmantri modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ye dono log unhen bahut kuch kehete rahete hai
 All this is acceptable to them but the neglect of Amethi and Rae Bareli is not tolerated
 unhone kaha ki pehle modi khush the lekin pradesh main sapa or congress kaa gathbandhan hone ke baad unka cheharaa badal gaya he or vah nafrat failaane kii raajnneeti karne lage hai
 Rahul again alleged that Modi gave a loan of one lakh 40 thousand crore rupees to 50 rich families of the country, but did not show them poor farmers
 vah chaahate to unka karj maaf kar sakate the, magar unhone aisa nahin kiya
 He said that Modi gave Rs 1200 crore to industrialist Vijay Mallya and this Dhankuber fled to London
 tippaniyan Rahul said that wherever Modi goes, he makes a new promise
 vah hameshaa jhuthe vaade karte hai or yuvaaon tathaa garibon ke sapanom ko todate hai
 He once again raised the issue of cancellation of the food park project in Amethi, saying that the Modi government did not allow the food park to be built here
 agar yahaan isaki sthapana hoti to 10 hajaar logon ko rojgaar miltaa or kshetra ke lakhon kisaanon ko phayda hota
 Rahul, in his election meetings held in Amethi, alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing politics to divide and break the country
 jati ko jati se or dharm ko dharm se ladaana modi kii aadat ban gayi he
 He is doing the same in Uttar Pradesh
 unhone ‘naa hindu banegaa naa musalmaan banegaa, insaan kii aulad he insaan banegaa’ geet kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki modi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii vichaardhaara vaala hindustan kabhi nahin bana sakenge
 The Congress vice-president said that none of the great men who made unforgettable contributions to the independence of the country had any connection with the BJP or the Sangh
 chaahe mahatma gandhi hon, sardaar patel hon yaa phir bhagat singh
 The BJP and the Sangh have nothing to tell
 unhone sardaar patel kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki modi party kii raajnneeti ke liye mahaan vibhootiyon ko baantne kaa kaam naa karen
 Rahul accused Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah that both these people keep telling him a lot
 yah sab unhen manjuur he lekin amethi or raibareli kii upeksha bardaasht nahin he
 He said that earlier Modi was happy but after the alliance of SP and Congress in the state, his face has changed and he has started doing politics of spreading hate
 rahul ne phir aarope lagaaya ki modi ne desh ke 50 amir pariwaron ko ek lakh 40 hajaar karod rupee kaa karj de diya, lekin unhen ve garib kisaan nahin dikhaayi diye
 He could have forgiven his debt if he wanted, but he did not do so
 unhone kaha ki modi ne udyogpati vijay maalya ko 1200 karod rupee de diye or yah dhankuber landan bhaag gaya
 The comments rahul ne kaha ki modi jahaan bhi jate hai, ek nayaa vaada kar dete hai
 He always makes false promises and breaks the dreams of the youth and the poor
 unhone amethi main food park pariyojna ko radd kiye jane kaa mudda ek baar phir uthaate hue kaha ki modi sarkaar ne yahaan food park nahin banane diya
 If it was established here, then 10 thousand people would have got employment and lakhs of farmers of the area would have benefited
 unhone ‘naa hindu banegaa naa musalmaan banegaa, insaan kii aulad he insaan banegaa’ geet kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki modi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii vichaardhaara vaala hindustan kabhi nahin bana sakenge

 Odisha has received about 6 and a half thousand crores in the District Minerals Fund, but so far the government here has been able to spend only 1 thousand crores

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that out of the 12 crore farmers of the country to whom we are giving direct help in the bank account under the Kisan Samman Nidhi, there is not a single farmer of Odisha because the government here has become a wall before the farmers

 He said that in Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity too, men are dominant only
 shri ram chandra ne bhi shaq ke aadhaar par sita ji ko chhod diya tha
 We have to change the whole system
 haalanki, is bayaan par vivaad hone ke baad unhone maafee bhi maang lee
 He said that my statement was taken incorrectly
 Women treated unfairly in all communities, not just Muslims, even Hindus, Christians, Sikhs etc
 In every society, there is male domination
 Even Shree Ram Chandra ji once left Sita ji after doubting her

 It seems that in the Samajwadi Party's political riot in Uttar Pradesh, the contest is going on between Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav
 donon aamane-saamne hai or raajnneetik varchasv main apane ko or majboot karne main lage hue hai
 But is it really that father and son are stuck in it or is this whole game actually pointing towards some big strategy
 aisa maanane ke peeche khaasi thos vajahen hai
 In the battle of succession, the whole game of politics is being played between two people and all the others are either pawns and or tamashabin
 isse hua yah he ki mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav or majboot hokar nikle hai
 Especially for Akhilesh, this fight is positive in many ways
 mulaayam singh raajnneeti main is tarah ke khelon ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 It is said that Mulayam Singh has always been defying speculation and speculation and he is such a person who has the ability to surprise anyone at any time
 wo daaen baaju kya kar rahe hote hai, yah baayen baaju ko bhi samaj nahin aata he
 That is why, unnecessarily, Mulayam is letting his party and family become unstable and that too when it is difficult to believe that the state assembly elections are going on
 jis mitti ke mulaayam bane hue hai, usamen manch ke peeche ek duusare or bade khel kii bhanak saaf mil rahi he
 And this is the inking of the war of succession
 nuksaan kisezara gaur se dekhie samaajawaadee party or uttar pradesh sarkaar ke puure raajnneetik sankat ko ki koun hai wo log jinhen yadav parivaar ke puure khel kaa sabase zyaada nuksaan hua he
 Shivpal is definitely seen playing on Mulayam's shay but during this time Shivpal has been taken out of the cabinet like a fly
 unako ek maheene ke andar hi do baar akhilesh ne mantrimandal se baahar kar diya
 Today the situation is that a large part of the army of the commander who ruled the organization unanimously, is seen raising slogans in favor of Akhilesh
 sarkaar main shivpal kii saakh na ke baraabar he
 And Akhilesh has demolished his fortifications in Samajwadi Party
 ramgopal wo duusare chehre hai jisamen is party ke andar khel karne kii kshamta he
 The reason is that he belongs to the Yadav family
 unke paas bhale hi jansamarthan kam ho or wo party ke kam lokapriy chehre hai lekin wo kunbe kii kamazor nabzon se vaakif hai or isliye unhen akhilesh ke naam par philhal dandit karnaa unke kad ko kamatar karne jaisaa he
 It is not surprising that the sp's Professor Saheb is now obliged to sing the praises of Akhilesh
 kuch log kah sakate hai ki party kii is andruni kalah kaa sidhaa nuksaan akhilesh yadav ko hua he
 But it is not so
 darasal, nuksaan samaajawaadee party ko hua he
 The loss to the party is shared
 wo keval akhilesh kaa nahin he
 Not only do Akhilesh have to pay the price for this loss, everyone will become its victim
 akhilesh hue or majabutabalki aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki akhilesh is puure ghatnakram main sabase kam nuksaan kii sthiti main hai
 Akhilesh has been rather profitable
 sarkaar par ab unka puri tarah se niyantran he
 Today almost all the mlas are with Akhilesh
 mantrimandal unke saath khadaa he
 a large part of the party's workers have been associated with Akhilesh and at the behest of Akhilesh, he may be able to strengthen him with a new political platform
 akhilesh ne kunbe or bahriyon ke hamalon ke pratifal main samaaj ke har varg kii sahanubhuti hasil kar lee he
 Everyone is looking with sympathy towards Akhilesh
 kuch maheene pehle tak sthiti aisi nahin thi
 Akhilesh, along with his personality, had to carry the image of the entire clan
 ab aisa nahin he
 Notwithstanding the same clan, Akhilesh is seen today as a different personality and a better choice
 akhilesh kii sabase badi jeet yah he ki bhale hi wo raajnneeti apane pita or parivaar ke jaisi karte aae hon, lekin aaj akhilesh apane pita sahit baaki saare logon se alag apni ek aadhunik or majboot chhavi ke saath ek behatar raajnneetik vikalp banakar ubhare hai
 Four and a half years, the government which has been accused of having a government of four and a half chief ministers, is a government of one person just before the elections
 mulaayam singh yadav jaisaa ecchhatra vyakti bhi use uski gaddi se hilaa nahin paata he
 For the first time, Akhilesh has emerged as such a strong and fearless Chief Minister
 mulaayam kyon kar rahe hai asapani umr ke utaar par aate mulaayam ke liye sabase mahatvapurn he apane uttaradhikari ko chunanaa or use apane rahete sthapit kar dena
 Mulayam may have designed this entire strategy with the same intention, it seems clear
 mulaayam singh yadav kii pehali patibaddhta khud ke prati he
 But he has only one option on the latter question and that is his son Akhilesh Yadav
 log kah sakate hai ki betaa to pratik yadav bhi he
 But Prateek Yadav is not the son of Mulayam Singh Yadav, but the son of Sadhana Gupta
 mulaayam singh yadav ne unhen apana naam diya he lekin wo unke khun se paidaa aulad nahin hai
 Therefore, the affection and attachment of Mulayam to Akhilesh can never be towards the symbol
 akhilesh ne aisa kuch galat kiya bhi nahin he ki wo mulaayam kii ankhon se utren or unki jagah koi or le le
 Rather, the responsibility handed over to the son by the father, Akhilesh has done it well
 pratik kabhi bhi raajnneeti ko lekar utsahit nahin rahe
 So Mulayam Singh Yadav is not expected to find common in Acacia
 pratik se zyaada padhe likhe akhilesh ne pita kii khadaauun ko sir par rakhkar apane pair raajnneeti kii baitarani main utaar die hai
 Now Mulayam wants his footman to take his name and dominance forward
 yahi kaaran he ki puure parivaar ke logon ko kinare rakhkar 2012 main satta kaa mukut akhilesh ke sir rakhaa gaya
 But the succession which was limited to a five-year chair in 2012 has now broadened to the party and family
 soobe main is chunaav main sapa kii vaapasi kii gunjaaish kam he
 And till the coming of the next election or the face that the party will need, it may not be Netaji because age is now dominating him
 aaj samaajawaadee party main mulaayam singh yadav ke baad doosraa sabase bada naam akhilesh yadav he
 The fears of his post-civil war have been eradicated from Netaji even before he was born and now Akhilesh is freed from his family and party's image and becomes his successor
 aise main akhilesh raajnneeti main rakhane-dikhaane ke liye ek adhik majboot, aadhunik, eemaandaar, kushal shaasha or saaf chhavi kaa netaa banakar ubhare hai
 All this is undeserved
 isamen se kaaphi kuch is maheene bhar se jari paariwarik kalah ke kaaran sambhav ho sakaa he
 It is clear that Netaji has found his Ram by playing Kopbhavan
 a post shared by Dhadak (@dhadak_2018) on Jul 16, 2018 at 3:59am PDT BSP MP Dhananjay Singh and his wife Jagriti Singh have been arrested on Tuesday in connection with the murder of their 35-year-old maid

 There is no possibility of US President-elect Donald Trump interfering to resolve the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan

 After the loss to the West Indies in the second semi-final match of the World T20 at the Wankhede ground in Mumbai, Dhoni interviewed a foreign journalist on the same question
 aaie is puure dilachasp vaakye ko ham aapako shabdon ke saath hi photo or video ke jariye bhi bataate hai
 Dhoni's joke on the question of retirement: In the post-match press conference, Australian reporter Sam Ferris asked Dhoni, "you have done everything in the game , are you willing to continue playing?" ' is sawaal par dhoni ke ravaiye ne vahaan baithe sabhi logon ko hairaan kar diya

 com / 629j9scsjy— Dwayne DJ Bravo (@djbravo47)march 31, 2016 Relationships are formed by emotions, but like everything else, too much of it can be harmful
 kai baar bahut adhik imotional logon ke saath jindagi bitaana mushkil ho jaataa he
 Such people take most things in a negative way
 unhen hameshaa yahi lagata he ki unke saath galat ho rahaa he
 Because of this, their relationship also gets sour
 agar aapkaa partner bhi bahut imotional he to in upayon se aap uski madad kar sakati hai
 Listen to their words carefully Pay attention to your partner's words and sit with them and listen to them with love, creates a positive feeling in them
 isliye yah bahut jaruri he ki aap apane pati ke saath kuch samay guzaaren taaki aapako unke dimag main chalane vaali baton kaa pataa lag sake
 Help to build their confidence, if you feel that your husband is depressed and full of negative feelings at all times, then sit with him and try to know his mind
 agar vah apane udhaas hone kii koi bhi sahi vajah nahin de pate to unhen samajhaayen ki aap unke saath hameshaa hai or sab jald hi thik ho jayega
 Win their trust, spend more and more time with your husband and keep him feeling special
 aapke aisa karne se vah apni shaadishuda jindagi ko enjoy karne lagenge
 a little extra care will bring you closer to them and will become a big reason for them to be happy with you
 vajah jaanane kii koshish karanjab aap unke najadik rahengi to aapako unke swabhaav or aadaton ke bare main pataa chalane lagegaa
 Try to find out from their habits what is the reason that they are like this and try to help them in their own way
 dhairya banaaen rakheipane pati kii dekhbhaal karne main kai baar aisa hoga ki aap khud ko vakt kam de paaengi
 In this case, be patient and do not let your positive thinking fall short

 The Chinese military strategist Sun Tsu was the prime mover of this idea

 Nearly 200 years ago, George Washington used this strategy in the war of American independence, and while leading the Chinese Revolution of 1949, Mao Tse Tung also expressed his faith in this strategy
 aaj pradhanmantri modi in mahaan netaaon kii fehrist main shaamil ho gaye hai jinhone apane phaayde ke liye is ajeebogareeb virodhabhasi pad kaa istemaal itihaas main kiya he
 In his address on Independence Day this year, Modi shocked the power establishment of Pakistan
 kashmir main haalia asthirataa ke dauraan bharat ke khilaaf ek bade antarrashtriya abhiyaan kaa aagaaj karne vaale pakistan ko modi ne sanket de daalaa ki ve is jang ko pakistan kii sarajameen ke bheetar ghuskar ladgaye ke liye taiyaar hai
 From the ramparts of the Red Fort, Modi said, "today i would like to thank some people and congratulate them
 pichley kuch dinon ke dauraan baluchistan, gilgit-blatistan or pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir kii janata ne mujhe shubhakamanaayen bheji hai or aabhaar jataayaa he
 People who have been living so far, whom i have never seen, whom i have never met - have expressed appreciation to the Prime Minister of India, to the 125 crore countrymen
 yah hamaare desh ke logon ke liye ek sakvamaan kii baat he
 "for Modi's bold betting, referring to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was normal because India has always been asserting its claims on gilgit-baltistan as" unfinished work of partition "
 iske saath haalanki baluchistan praant ke sankatagrast logon ke sarokaaron ke jode jane se islamabad bhadak uthaa or duniya bhar ke desh kuch hairaan rah gaye
 One obvious reason for this must have been the alleged human rights violations of the Pakistani army on the protesters demanding independence
 ise haalanki bhartiya suraksha balon kii kashmir ghati main 'barbarta' sambandhi pakistan ke lagaae aaropon ke palatwaar se kuch zyada hi samajha gaya
 Modi was clearly warning Pakistan that India is now changing its position from the current state of talks and has come in an aggressive defense posture
 unka aashay tha ki bharat jarurat padane par kathor bhi ho saktaa he
 The implication of this is that India has now decided that fomenting terrorist groups and attacks will now prove to be a costly deal for Pakistan
 aisa kah kar bhartiya pradhanmantri ne sidhe pakistani fouj, khaskar uske mukhiya raahil sharif ko sidhi chunauti de di he
 The Pakistani army had stymied Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's efforts to improve relations with India and is believed to have also attacked the Pathankot air force base this January
 bharat ab yah sanket de rahaa he ki vah niyantran rekha se kaaphi dur sthit pakistani ilaakon main asthirataa failaane ko icchhuk he
 By doing this, Modi has played a bold bet which is full of risks
 sawaal uthaae gaye ki kya bharat ne aisa ranneetik rup se isliye kiya taaki duniya kaa dhyaan kashmir main jari ashaanti se bhatakaaya ja sake
 It was also asked whether Modi thought of dealing with both China and Pakistan simultaneously, as the move also challenges China's vital interests in Balochistan
 kai or ngkshachataayen jaahir kii gayi: bharat aakhir pakistan ke vishwasghaat ke khilaaf duniya se karrwai kii ummid kaise kar saktaa he jab vah khud algaavvaadiyon ko samarthan detaa hua dikhaai de rahaa ho? kya baluchistan main apni dilchaspee jaahir karke bharat aatank ke khilaaf jang main apane oonche naitik paaydaan ko ganvaa degaa? yah bhi sawaal uthaa ki agar pakistan ne badale main bhartiya thikaanon par hamale kar die, to kya bharat iskaa majbootee se jawaab dene ko taiyaar he or kya nabhikeey yuddh kaa jokhim uthaa saktaa he?utaar-chadhaavmahaj do saal main modi ne apane bigadel padosi ke saath rishte behaal karne kii koshish main sadbhaav se lekar badjubaani tak sab kuch aajamaa liya he
 Opposition parties have accused Modi of adopting an "out-of-the-way" policy in the case of Pakistan, which is not strong anyway and has no long-term strategy
 modi kaa samarthan karne vaale churchill ko uddhrut kar rahe hai ki ''sirf gadahe hi sambhaav main rahete hai''
 a top official says, "you can't keep your eyes off what the other is doing
" pakistan main agar halaat teji se badal rahe hai to aapaki niti kaise nahin badalegi? pakistan agar sthir main nahin he to ham kaise rah sakate hai? ''modi ko is baat kaa shrey jaataa he ki unhone apane padosiyon ko tarjeeh dete hue may 2014 main apane shapath grahan samaaroh main anya dakshin asian netaaon ke saath navaj sharif ko bhi nyotaa bheja tha
 However, the atmosphere changed after the foreign secretary level talks were deferred when India accused Pakistan of playing the Hurriyat card

 Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit accused India of embarrassing Sharif and breaching confidentiality by leaking unconfirmed findings from jit's visit
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki badale main bharat kii maang kaa koi praavdhaan nahin tha
 India concluded from this that there is a tremendous war of power between the two Sharifs, which has broken the ground of better relations

 navaj sharif, jo ab tak bharat par die bayanon ke maamle main sanyam baratate aae the, dabaav main jumalebaji karne lage or unhone kah daalaa ki ''kashmir kii aawaaj bananaa'' unke liye 'badhyakaari' he
 In a hurry, he sent a letter to the secretary-general of the United Nations and the High Commissioner of Human Rights at the United Nations, urging them to intervene to end 'continued and egregious violations of human rights'

 In the meantime, Modi took swift steps to bring the situation under control
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ko ghati main bheja gaya
 After this, the Prime Minister held an all-party meeting

 iske alaava baluchistan main kisi kulbhushan jadhav kii giraftaar kaa bahut hallaa hua jis par bhartiya jasoos hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya or pakistan ne use vaanijya duutavas se sampark nahin karne diya
 After all this happened, then the player of dangers, Modi, adopted the attacking posture and threw the dice of Balochistan
 baluchistan hi kyon?aisa isliye kyonki pakistan kaa sabase bada or sabase pichhadaa praant hone ke alaava baluchistan pashchimi asia or madhya asia ke liye ranneetik rasta muhaiyaa karaata he
 The province has Gwadar port on which China has invested heavily on modernization
 iske alaava china ne vahaan patte par khadaanen lee hai taaki vahaan maujuud sone or tambe ke baari bhandaron kaa dohan kar sake
 Much of China's ambitious CPEC project is located in Baluchistan, which gives it decisive importance
 baluchistan pakistan ke liye lagaataar dard kii tarah rahaa he
 Its border with Afghanistan and Iran is 2,500 kilometers long, which is the bastion of cross-border terrorism and tension
 pakistan ke saath 1948 main vilay ke baad se balooch janata ne rah-rah kar swaittata or aazaadee ke liye sangharsh chhedaa he jise pakistani surakshabalon ne barbarta se kuchlaa he
 Islamabad has been continuously accusing India's espionage organization RAW of causing instability there
 haalanki vah kabhi bhi thos sakshya nahin de sakaa
 When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh allowed him to mention Balochistan in a joint statement issued with Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani in sharm-el-sheikh in 2009, BJP leaders slammed him for this 'blunder' It was said that "seven sea water will not wash away this shame
" '' is kadam ko pakistan ke aantarik maamalon main bharat ke dakhal kii sweekruti ke taur par dekha gaya tha or manmohan ko apane kadam peeche khinchne ko majaboor hona padaa tha
 It will be very annoying for Manmohan today that the Balochistan whom he was accused of being rude to bring to the table, today Modi is being declared courageous for his statements
 modi ke samarthak baluchistan par doharepan kii aalochana ko khaarij karte hai
 a top official said that when Manmohan mentioned Balochistan, it was a defensive response to Pakistan's accusation against India, while Modi accused Pakistan of human rights violations in Balochistan
 pakistan kii is aalochana par, ki bharat ne baluchistan kaa zikr karke seemaa laangh di he, bharat ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne jawaab diya, ''apni kootneeti main to pakistan kisi simarekha ko nahin maanata
 Today, its record of cross-border terrorism and infiltration is at the root of the problem in the region
 '' unhone yah bhi sanket kiya ki bharat vahaan maanavadhikaar ulanghan kaa masalaa ateet main kai baar uthaa chukaa he
 Pakistan has also crossed Kashmir in the past
 usne khalistaan andolan ko samarthan diya tha tathaa mumbai or pathankot main hue aatanki hamalon ke peeche bhi uskaa haath rahaa he
 The official says, "if they are not playing by the rules, then why should we play?" "the reason for Pakistan's nervousness is National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, who is a master of aggressive defense and had issued a warning years ago," Once you do something like Mumbai, Balochistan will go out of hand
 ''aage kii chunautiyandonon deshon ke bich sulah-samjhaute kii raah lagaataar sankari hoti ja rahi he
 Pakistan has encouraged activists across the country to burn effigies of Modi to mobilize nationalist support for Balochistan
 pakistan ke adhikari modi or aresas par aarope lagaate hai ki ve uttar pradesh or punjab ke aagaamee chunaav jeetne ke liye vibhaajan paidaa kar rahe hai
 a Pakistani official said that if India thinks that it will destabilize Balochistan or gilgit-baltistan, then it is in a tizzy
 modi or unki team kaa yah maananaa he ki duniya kashmir main apni taang adaane nahin ja rahi
 After the attacks in Nice, Brussels and Paris, there is no sympathy in the world for the terrorists who wear the freedom fighters
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ''burhan vaani agar unke yahaan hota to kya use bardaasht kar liya jaataa? vaise bhi, bharat or pakistan ke bich kashmir ek ranjai match jaisaa he, ashes jaisaa nahin—isliye pakistan ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 "on the issue of what is to be done in Kashmir, the Prime Minister has taken the entire political system with great understanding
 unhone jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ke is anurodh par dhyaan diya he ki sabhi rajnatik takaton ko saath lekar 'ek sthaayee samaadhaan' nikaala jaae
 In the name of Balochistan, Modi has given a befitting reply to Pakistan's attack on Kashmir, the other has met the much awaited demand of the people sitting in wait for a tough reply
 isaki ranneetik upyogita haalanki simit he
 Iran and Afghanistan may be happy that India is now taking on Pakistan on the issue of Balochistan, but they will also be worried that they have enough Baloch population
 jald hi china bhi agar akadgaye laga to bharat ko apni sarhad par do dushmano ko ek saath sanbhaalanaa mushkil ho jayega
 That is why Modi will have to continue his action along with his intention
 unhen iske liye ek sangathit yojana taiyaar kerani hogi or kaaphi saavdhaneepurvak us par chalanaa hoga
 Modi has shown that he has the ability to think freely, but all he needs to do is to take care that he does not get burdened by his own actions

 desh main petrol kii record mulya vruddhi ke khilaaf congress samet puure vipaksh ne ajbharat bandka aahvaan kiya he
 The Indian band is led by the Congress party, with the support of about 20 political parties
 vahinshivsenake party pramukhuddhav thakrene bijepi par party ke mukhapatrasamnaamen tikhaa waar kiya he
 At the same time, he also talked about carrying the burden of the opposition party
 gauratlab he ki shivasena aaj ke band main shaamil nahin he
 In the face, Uddhav wrote that some opposition parties including Congress have declared Hindustan bandh
 deshbhar main jis tarah mahangaai badi he, uske liye janata main jagriti paidaa karne ke liye yah band he, aisa virodhiyon kaa kahana he
 Many regional parties from all over the country are joining it, so this bandh will definitely be successful to some extent
 aisa hona bhi chahie
 Parties like Rashtriya Janata Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party have landed in this bandh
 isliye uttar bharat main band kaa 100 pratishat asar dekhne ko milegaa
 According to the party chief, the announcement of the bandh is not for political reasons but to draw attention to inflation related to life
 janata ke sawaalon par virdohi dalon kii gathree thik se bandha rahi he yaa nahin, yah is band ke bahaane nishchit hi spasht ho jayega
 Thackeray said that the public is tolerating the heat of daily inflation
 ab yah aanch nahin rahi balki janata mahangaai ke dawanal main jhulas rahi he
 The kind of fire that is needed to burn a pyre, this fire is the same and inflation fire has been set up to kill the public
 isliye is aag se jhulasati janata jaagi nahin he or wo jage isiilie ye ‘band’ he, yah samaj ke baahar he
 The public is awake wo 2019 main sattadhariyon kii lanka dahan karegi
 Uddhav is accused that Modi's government has failed at all levels, opponents have said
 dusron kaa to hamen pataa nahin, lekin mahangaai ne janata ko nanga kar diya he
 How can the public live in this situation? The Shiv Sena chief further wrote that Maharashtra Minister Chandrakant Patil said, "show me the leader of the BJP one day, then you will know how difficult it is to run a government
" ' hamaara patil se kahana he ki sarkaar or bhaajapa ke paas chaaron taraf se paisa hi paisa aa rahaa he
 Elections are being fought on the same
 ham kehete hai bhaajapa netaa hona aasaan he
 One day show by living the life of scorched general public, is it possible? In the fortunes of the general public these days, along with pits in the roads, there has been a pit in the stomach
 virdohi dalon ne band kaa elaan kiya he, isliye unke naam se ungliyaan chatkhate ho? sarkaar kisaanon kaa sankat dur nahin kar saki
 In 2014, Modi assured that Harsal youths would get two crore jobs in the country, but the opposite happened
 har saal 20 lakh naukariyaan ghat garin
 Youth do not work

 The price of fuel is increasing daily
 vikaas dar badhane kii publicity karte ho
 Also put a government poster on rising fuel prices
 thakare ne aage likhaa ki rahul gandhi maansaahaari hai, aisa bolne waalon ko mahangaai par bolnaa chahie
 When will BJP leaders speak on rising inflation and scorched people? Are they going to speak on inflation by announcing a new bandh when they sit in opposition in 2019? The question of inflation has become a question of life and death of the public

 ye shoshan kaise thamega?janata jaagi hi he, lekin soya hua vipaksh ab jaagaa he or unhone band kaa elaan kiya he
 Why Shiv Sena is not joining the bandh will be asked now
 hamen mahangaai main jhulasati janata ke prati sahanubhuti he
 We have always kept public problems
 janata kii aawaaj banakar hamane sarkaar main tandav machaaya

 co / spqzsfhlab uttarakhand kaa mul nivasee koun? yah vivaad is rajya ke gathan ke samay se hi jari he
 Recently, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Indira Hridayesh once again gave it a wind by making a statement that only the people living in Uttarakhand at the time of formation of the state would be considered as natives of this place
 haridwar se bhaajapa vidhayak aadesh chouhan ke sawaal ke jawaab main indira hridayesh ne sadan main kaha ki rajya gathan kii taarikh 9 november, 2000 tak rajya main bas chuke sabhi logon ko rajya kaa mul nivasee mana jayega
 With this announcement, till the time of formation of the state, lakhs of people who have come from other states and settled in the plains districts of the state have now found a way to get government jobs and take advantage of reservation
 yahi vivaad kii jad he
 Despite the ongoing protests and support for over a decade, the four governments that have come so far could not take any decision on the issue
 17 sitambar, 2012 ko uttarakhand hycourt ke nyaayadhish sudhanshu dhulia kii ekal peeth ne mul nivas or jati pramaan ke maamle main daayar aadha darjan se adhik vyaktigat yachikaaon par nirnay dete hue kaha ki rajya gathan ke samay tak sthaayee rup rah se rahe logon ko yahaan kaa mul nivasee mana jayega
 It has been clarified in the order that under the Constitutional Order 1950, the castes which have been classified as SC / ST / OBC, if they have settled in Uttarakhand before the formation of the state, cannot be denied any facility of the state
 
 mul nivasee kaa arth yah nahin he ki jiske purvaj bhugolic kshetra uttarakhand main rahete hon, vahi yahaan kaa mul nivasee hoga, balki iskaa aashay pratham presidential aadesh ke samay 1950 main samast uttar pradesh main based logon se he
 Political parties and agitational organizations have flared up after the court order and the announcement of the minister
 vahiin pichley teen dashak ke dauraan dehradun, haridwar, udhamsingh nagar or nainital main based lakhon log is faisle se raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The biggest relief has come to those students who were born and studied in Uttarakhand but they were deprived of appearing in the competitive examination simply because they did not have caste and permanent residence certificate
 manisha bharti, jyotsna jaise anek aise chaatr bhi isse vanchit rahe, jinhen jati pramaan patr hasil karne ke liye hycourt tak ladaai ladgai padi
 Angry political parties and organizations are agitating on the streets
 eukedy (pi) ne sarkaar ke aadesh ke khilaaf 13 disambar ko vidhansabha ke baahar upwas or 16 se 24 disambar tak vidhayak awaas kaa gheraav kiya
 UKD (P) President Trivendra Singh Panwar says, "the limit for all states to be natives is fixed for the year 1950, but the government has raised this limit to 2000
 yah rajya ke vaastavik mul nivaasiyon kii andekhi he
 The UKD has also promised to raise the issue in the House by surrounding the bjp-congress mlas
 bhaajapa-congress ke kai netaa is mudde par andolankariyon ke saath jud rahe hai
 "the government has taken this decision to benefit builders, land mafia, liquor and mining mafia from backdoor," says Ravindra Jugran, a BJP leader and former vice-president of the state agitator Samman Parishad
 ''bhaajapa-congress ke maidani jilon ke vidhayak sarkaar kii ghoshnaa or court ke aadesh se khush hai jabaki pahari jilon ke vidhayak is faisle ke khilaaf hai
 Both parties are avoiding saying anything clearly
 baavjood iske jahaan bhaajapa pravaktaa satish lakheda ne kaha ki sarkaar ko rajya gathan kii avadharana ke mutabik nirnay karnaa chahie, vahiin haridwar se bhaajapa vidhayak aadesh chouhan ne kaha ki yah nirnay to pehle hona chahie tha
 Former Parliamentary Affairs Minister and BJP leader Prakash Pant termed the politics on the issue of native residence as a step to divide the state
 bakaul pant, ''rajya gathan ke liye sansad main pesh kiye bill ke dauraan rajya main mul nivasee ke liye cat of date par nirnay nahin ho paaya tha
 Indira Hridayesh says that all children born and raised in the state are entitled to certificates
 virodh ke saath faisle kaa swaagat bhi ho rahaa he
 "the opposition to this decision is opposed to the development of Uttarakhand," says Kunwar Japendra Singh, state president of Uttaranchal United Sarva Samaj
 '' congress netaa dhirendra pratap kaa kahana he ki mul nivas par cat of date tay karte samay sarkaar ko andolankariyon kii bhaavana kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 cpi-ml's Garhwal Secretary Indresh Makhuri says that preventing outsiders from entering the state is an anti-constitutional and blind regionalist mindset

 iaiti khadgpur main mechanical ejineering ke tritiy varsh ke chaatr atal ashutosh agarwal ne kaha, ‘‘iaiti se snaatak karne ke baad mere saamne raajnneeti bhi vikalpon main se ek he
 Kejriwal has proved that people from iits and engineering backgrounds can also succeed in politics
 ’’ dilli nivasee agarwal ke man main raajnneeti ke prati tab rujhaan paidaa hua jab unhone iaiti ke purv chaatr (kejariwal) ko saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ke saath bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladate dekha
 Agarwal, who has already joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said, "kejriwal has made it easier for us to enter politics
 unhone hamen ek maarg dikhaaya he or vah ek prerana hai
 '' dilli vidhansabha chunaav main online or phone par prachaar abhiyaan main aap kii madad karne vaale jiophysics ke dwitiya varsh ke chaatr lokesh deshmukh ne kaha ki sheersh ejineering santhaan se party main swayamsevi ke rup main shaamil hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya bad rahi he
 He said, "it is all because of Kejriwal because everyone in the institute campus has a special affection for him because he is from our midst
" ’’ On Facebook, hundreds of young iitians have united on the community page 'AAP IIT Kharagpur' to discuss political developments and party related issues
 pej par 20 hajaar se zyada ‘like’ pehle hi aa chuke hai
 Such politics is prohibited on the IIT campus because political activities are not allowed inside
 kejariwal ne iaiti khadgpur se mechanical ejineering kii thi
 He stayed for five years in its Nehru Hall Hostel which is known for its social and cultural activities
 agarwal ne kaha, ‘‘vah hindi dramatics socity kii baithkon main niyamit taur par shaamil hote the or jan samvaad, vaad vivaad aadi se sambandhit aayojan main sakriy rahete the
 This gave him good eloquence, which is now helping him in the political world
 ’’ Professor Shankar Kumar Shom, former director of the institute and who has taught Kejriwal, said that holistic education is provided in the institute so that students reach the pinnacle of success in every field
 unhone kaha, ‘‘paas out hone ke baad ve jo kariyar chahen apana sakate hai

 The first sign of a solution between India and the US over the deadlock in the case of senior diplomat Devyani Khobragade was found on Monday when Devyani was granted exemption from personal appearance in a New York court hearing against him in a visa fraud case Has been udhar, devayani ko sanyukt raashtra main unke tabadale ke baad manyata mil gai he
 After his arrest in New York on 12 December and being released on bail, Devyani was transferred by the government to India's mission to the United Nations to grant him full diplomatic exemption
 unki niyukti ko manyata ke baad america ke videsh vibhaag main kuch kagaji karrwai hone kii sambhaavna he jiske liye bharat pehle hi kagajaat saunp chukaa he

 gujarey jamaane kii dream girl ke naam se mashhoor swapn sundari or bhaajapa netaa hema malini ab dev nadi ganga kii safai ke lakhon karodon shraddhaluon ke sapane ko puraa karengi or log kam se kam uttarakhand rajya kii seemaa main svachh ganga main dubkee laga sakenge
 The Government of Uttarakhand has appointed Hemamalini as the brand ambassador of the 'sparsh Ganga' program being run to clean the Ganges and it has been accepted by Hemamalini readily
 vah jald hi is silsile main uttarakhand kaa daura karengi
 State Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank started the Sparsh Ganga campaign last year to make Ganga completely clean and pollution-free from Gomukh to Haridwar in Uttarakhand and called on people to add milk to the Ganges and make it as milk-like
 did
 nishank ne bataaya ki hema ab is dev nadi kii nirmalata ke liye brands ambesder ke rup main sakriy rup se kaary karengi or unke saath is rajya ke lakhon log bhi ganga ko svachh karne main jutenge
 Nishank said that the name of the Purification Campaign has been given as Sparsh Ganga so that people get overwhelmed as soon as they touch the Ganges and its purity gets settled in people's minds
 ganga ke pani ko shastron main amrit bataaya gaya he or sahi bhi he ki jin jadi bootiyon or aushadhiy vrikshon se sparsh karte huye ganga kaa jal neeche aata he usase ganga kaa pani vaaki main amrit ho jaataa he
 He said that bottling of the Ganges water is being planned to spread it all over the world and the water released from the glacier will be filled directly into the bottle
 ganga ko vishwa main failaane ke uddeshy se hi ganga jal ko marishas ke pradhanmantri naveen ramgulam ne apane desh ke ‘ganga talab’ main bade hi shraddha ke saath pravaahit kiya tha jiske baad vahaan upasthit logon kaa yah maananaa tha ki ganga ko ab vishwa ke anya hisson main bhi le jaaya janaa chaiye
 The Chief Minister said that his government has initiated a unique effort to clean the Ganga and appointed Hemamalini as brand ambassador to make this campaign more country-wide
 unhone bataaya ki ganga ko sangrakshit karne ke liye is abhiyaan ko yudhstar par chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Former Swapnasundari Hemamalini has been appointed as the brand ambassador to maintain the naturalness of the water in the form of the nectar of the Ganges and to make this historic and dreamy project tangible at the ground level
 hema is kaam ko sahaj rup se karengi or logon ko ganga safai ke liye protsaahit karengi
 Under Sparsh Ganga, the state government has also included students from various schools, colleges and universities and youths of NCC, NSS, Yuva Mangal Dal and other institutions have been added to it
 nishank ne bataaya ki desh ke anya hisson main basane vaale uttarakhand ke nivaasiyon ko is aitihaasik abhiyaan main jodne ke liye bhi ek yojana banaai gayi he jisamen brands ambesder ke rup main hemamalini kaa sakriy sahyog liya jaayegaa
 He said that the recent historic success of the Mahakumbh has developed immense reverence for the Ganges in a total of 140 countries and 65 types of linguistic people have written hundreds of articles about the Ganges in their own countries and through audio videos The faith of millions of people has been shown towards Ganga, which has not only become a matter of pride for Uttarakhand, but it has raised the forehead of the whole country
 Come
 nishank ne bataaya hemamalini ne baatcheet main sweekaar kiya he ki uttarakhand aane se hi logon ko aadhyatm kii anubhuti hoti he or ganga snaan tathaa ganga darshan to bejod anubhuti detaa he

 It is important that we look at the world of crime; see the pictures that have been plaguing us for the whole year
 magar jab ham calendar ko peeche palatate hai to puure saal saal ke har maheene hamen aatank kaa khauf kaa ek hi cheharaa najar aata he
 The face of Baghdadi and its bloodthirsty way of sharing death
 aatank kii khilaafat kaayam karne kii sanak ne is insaan ko itnaa khoonkhaar bana diya ki ab khuf bhi isse khuf khaane laga he
 In the year 2016, death through the sandy land of Iraq and Syria reached the world in such a frightening manner, as never seen and thought
 duniya main dehshat or darindagi kaa ek jeeta-jaagta putala he bagdadi
 At its behest, countless people have been killed for the last two and a half years, but there is a difference between death and death
 bagdadi apane dushmano ko jaisi maut detaa he, wo insaani soch se pare he
 10 faces of Baghdadi i
e
 10 ways of death Baghdadi's face number-1-head pen June 19, 2016, Raqqa, Syria, It was probably the darkest day in the history of ism's zulmo-sitam, because this day ISIS has just four One year old girl was beheaded
 vaise to iesas kii darindagi kii koi intehaa hi nahin, lekin phir bhi itani choti si bacchee kaa sir kalam karne ke peeche akhir koun si vajah ho sakati thi? to iskaa jawaab he, uski maa kaa allaah ke naam par kasam khaanaa
 The little girl came out of the house with her mother on this ill-fated date
 uski maa use ghar bhejnaa chaha, lekin taiyaar nahin thi
 She started insisting tab maa ne gusse main allaah kii kasam khate hue ye kaha ki agar wo ghar nahin gai to wo uskaa sir kaat degi
 That's all, the terrorists got so much in their ears
 phir to aatankwaadiyon ne us maa ko hi bacchee kaa sir kaatane ke liye kaha, lekin jab wo iske liye raji nahin hui, to aatankwaadiyon ne khud hi bacchee kaa sir kaat daalaa or uski maa ke haath uske khun se saan die
 Actually ISIS has been beheading enemies since its inception
 yaa yun kahen ki dushmano ko maut dene kaa ye uske sabase pasandida tarika he
 The world was shocked when ISIS beheaded 75 Syrian soldiers simultaneously for the first time on 25 July 2014
 iske baad usne thik kitne logon kaa sir kalam kiya, iskaa sahi-sahi hisaab kisi ke paas nahin
 However, the British and American hostages were seen many times in front of the camera by the world becoming victims of ISIS executioners and this trend is still going on
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number -2sir main goli maaranakisi ko ghutanon ke bal jameen par bitha kar bilkul kareeb se uske sir main goli maarna kitna bhayanak ho saktaa he, ye iesas ne duniya ko dikhaaya
 Going beyond all the limits of life, this terrorist organization shot and killed a number of unidentified people in the same head, and their treatment with their enemies is still going on
 lekin apane kuch propeganda video main to iesas ne jaise sari hadein kii khatm kar di
 Till now ISIS militants used to shoot their own victims, but now they started doing this work to innocent children too
 ji haa, kabs of kheliphet yani khilaafat ke shaavak ke naam se maasoom bacchon ko dehshatgardi kii aag main jhonk kar iesas ne usne bhi apane dushmano ko goli maravaanaa shuru kar diya
 By the way, ISIS law has its own separate punishment for every crime in the books
 lekin aam taur par jasusi ke jurm main pakade gaye logon aisi maut detaa he
 Forgive Baghdadi's face by throwing it from the top number-3 and the hands of a person are tied in feet
 wo sangeenon ke saaye se ghira he or bhaagna to dur wo apni marji se saans bhi nahin le saktaa
 He is taken to the top floor of a building in the same condition
 phir imaarat ke neeche khadey logon ke bich munaadi kar uske gunahon kii kahani sunaane ke baad use upar se sidhe neeche dhakel diya jaataa he
 This is such a scene, which only makes Rongte stand up after thinking about it
 lekin iesas ke raaj main samalangik hona, aisa gunaah he jiske liye bas yahi maut banati he
 To kill Baghdadi, to collect face-4, to kill, that is to be crushed with stones
 kya kuch insaan apane hi jaise insaanon kii jaan pattharon se kuchal kar le sakate hai? aapke liye sochna beshak mushkil ho, bahut se kattar muslim mulkon main aaj bhi aisa karnaa kaanoon ke daayre main hai
 Then ISIS is ahead of all limits of hatred and bigotry
 lihaaza, iesas bhi aksar aise dardanaak tareeqe se logon kii jaan letaa rahaa he
 By the way, the victims of the association are often more women who are accused of illegitimate relationships with someone
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-5aag main jalaakar marnapinjre main kaid ne in turki ke sainik ko jo maut di gai usne bagdadi kii ghatati dehshat ko phir se zindaa kar diya
 Baghdadi, fueled by Turkish intervention in Syria, held these soldiers in a cage before killing them
 jaanwaron kii tarah ghutanon ke bal chalaaya or phir haivaaniyat kii aisi ibaarat likhi, jise shaayad itani aasaani bhulaay nahin ja sakegaa
 These ammo straps were transported through chains and then fastened to them
 lohe kii in zanjiron main bhaagane kii koi gunjaaish nazar nahin aa rahi he
 Baghdadi's henchmen are recording every moment of fear before death on camera
 dar ke maare inkaa galaa is kadar khushk pad chukaa he
 These Turkish soldiers, who had already been bathed in petrol, were thrown into the fire of death
 kaale libaas vaale is yamraj ne maut kaa remote nikaal liya
 This remote is actually the trigger of the gunpowder that is touching their bodies passing through this iron chain
 trigar dabaa or barood ne aag pakad lee
 Momentum Momentum Death started increasing rapidly
 jindagi ne in lapaton main jhulas kar dam tod diya
 With the face of Baghdadi in the number-6 boat, hardly any executioner in Marithaarikh has found out as many ways of death as Baghdadi gave to its criminals in this one year
 iesas ke in darinde ne maut kaa ye dardanaak khel khilne ke liye tamaam intezaam kiye hai
 One by one they were placed in this white boat
 video main nazar aa rahaa he ki do bandhak pehle se baithe hue the or baaki ke chaar bandhakon ko ye do aatanki gardan se pakadakar boat kii taraf le ja rahe hai
 In pairs of two, these hostages were placed in the boat
 
 The fear of death is clearly visible on everyone's face
 ye jaanate hai ki yahaan se batch paanaa naammumkin he, lekin magar jaalim bagdadi ke bandhakon ko maut bhi aasaani se nahin milti
 It is also difficult to guess the horror of the very young boys sitting in the boat
 naav main bithakar pehle inke haath pair baandh die gaye
 The boat was then abandoned in the middle of the water
 boat pani main tair rahi, maut raftaa raftaa kareeb aati rahi
 Baghdadi's face number-7 is immersed in water and it is impossible for Maranlohe's cage to come out
 pinjre main lage chote-chote camere
 These cruel terrorists will record the scene of death in it
 ek-ek kar 5 kaidiyon ko naarangi rang ke jampasoot pahana kar pinjre main bheja gaya
 There is a fear of death on everyone's faces
 tabhi ek ishaara milte hi kraine is pinjade ko pani ke bich-bich le ai or dhire dhire pinjade ko pani main duubano shuru kar diya gaya
 The cage was first filled in half and then to the mouth
 pijadaa pani ke andar chalaa gaya or jab waapas nikaala gaya to saansein ruk chuki thim
 He killed the seven people who came under the claws of ISIS in the blasphemy of Baghdadi with the number-8 explosive
 narsanhaar kii ye tasviren aisi he ki inhen kisi bhi surat dikhaa paanaa mumkin nahin he
 7 people were taken captive to the open ground
 sabhi kaidiyon ke haath peeche kar ke baandh gaye or inaki gardanon main nile rang kii explosive vir ko baandha gaya phir datonator ke dhamaake ke saath in sabhi kii jivan lila ko samaapt kar diya
 Seeing this, perhaps even the greatest abuser may tremble
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-9car main dhamaake se udanachar kaidiyon ko iesas ke aatanki is tarah maut ke kareeb le gaye
 Hands tied gardan aatankiyon ne jakad main
 One by one, he was seated and tied in this car
 car ko baahar se lock kiya gaya
 They were left alone to travel from here to death
 phir ek aatanki ke haathon main nazar aayaa puri tarah se lod mortar launture
 Whose target was on the car
 ek ishaare ke baad mortar chali or sidhe is car main ja dhansi
 With a blast, the people sitting in the car flew away
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-10suuli par lataka kar maaranasuuli par latakaane kii tasviren aatank ke samrajya se bahut ain
 But the way American spies were killed this year by Baghdadi terrorists, it is difficult to describe the generosity in words
 kasaai khaane main jis tarah jibha karne ke baad jaanavar ko latakaaya jaataa he
 Similarly, to hang these hostages, the terrorists first tied their hands and then they were dragged one by one to the place where death was given
 phir unhen ulataa lataka diya gaya
 In this way everyone was shocked by the dreadful death

 'it is also worth noting that it is common for women to wait for hours in many areas of Bundelkhand to bring water
