 sex ko lekar har aurat or purush ke apane sawaal or myth hote he
 Doctor Aaron Carroll has broken such a myth
 unhone is mudde par ek kitaab bhi likhi hai
 Read Carroll's arguments and facts about these 10 myths here
 pehla myth -ling or mojey / kaan / haath kii lambaai main sambandh hota he
 Carroll argues that there is nothing like this
 is par bahut saare adhyayan ho chuke hai
 And this is completely irrational
 doosraa myth -purushon ke ling kii lambaai 7 inch hoti he
 According to Carroll, to be honest, the average penis length of men is 5 inches
 indiana ke ek santhaan dwaara 1600 purushon ke bich kiye survey main yah rigelt 5
 Remained 6 inches
 teesraa myth -condom pahananaa, sex kii timming ko gata detaa he
 Carol says that wearing a condom does not make any difference in sex time
 chauthaa myth -zyada sex se sperm banane kii prakriya par asar padataa he
 Carroll gave an example of a research conducted in 2005, saying that according to research based on 9500 samples taken from 6 thousand people, the average number of people having sex once a week was 3
 7 millilitre, jabaki sex karne se pehle din sex kiye hue logon kaa ausat rahaa 2
 3 ml jabaki sex karne ke baad usee din sex karne vaale logon kaa ausat rahaa 2
 4 ml paanchvaan myth -purush zyaadaatar gori stri ko pasand karte he, jiske bal kaale hon, bajaay bhure baalo vaali ke
 Carroll argues that it depends on the region or locality
 is bare main koi spasht rujhaan nahin he
 Sixth myth - Most women are not hairless
 carol kehete hai, '2 hajaar se zyada mahilaon par kiye gaye survey ke mutabik 11 pratishat mahilaon ne zyaadaatar samay apane bal saaf rakhe
 While 20 percent women did not clean their hair
 vahiin, 25 pratishat ne kuch samay apane pubic bal saaf kiye
 Although most women have some hair
 'saatvaan myth -chote kii apeksha bade stan kam samvedansheel hote he
 This is a false myth of Carol's horror
 sies se koi fark nahin padataa
 Eighth myth-sex is the best exercise
 carol kehete hai calories jalaane ke liye thik he
 But many people remained active for long
 30 minute ke sex main 85 se 250 calories jalati he or ise sabase badhiya eksrasij nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Ninth myth - The myth about women is that they cheat more
 ji nahin, carol ke mutabik purushon ke baraabar hi mahilaayein dhokhaa detii hai or isamen umr kii koi bhoomika nahin hoti
 According to a study, 23 percent of men cheat in their current relationships
 vahiin, 19 pratishat mahilaon ne bhi aisa hi kiya
 Tenth Myth - Dreaming occurs only to men
 carol kaa jawaab ye he ki swapndosh ke shikaar mahila or purush donon hi hote hai

 political afaire kamity kii vivaadit baithak memrajasthan ke prabhareebanaae jane ke baad se hi kumaar vishwaas or kejariwal camp ke bich talmail kii kami saaf taur par dekhi ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether Kumar Vishwas is fighting a war alone in Rajasthan's election ground? Recently, after the meeting with the party in-charge of Rajasthan was over, Kumar Vishwas returned without meeting the top party leaders present in the same office, and the party leaders also did not think it appropriate to meet him
 gauratlab he ki aam aadmi party main vivaadon kii tali donon haathon se baj rahi he
 There are many statements of Kumar Vishwas that party leaders and activists are not liking
 idhar haal hi menkumar vishwasane paryvekshakon kii baithak main kaha tha ki kaaryakartaaon ko 'back To Basic' par lautnaa hoga
 Responding to the fierce attacks on him, Biswas also said that he has to fight against the conspiracies from both inside and outside

 kumaar vishwaas kii team ne twitor par ' # backtobasic' abhiyaan shuru kar diya he, lekin ab tak kumaar vishwaas ko chhodkar kisi bade netaa ne ise ri-twit yaa share nahin kiya he
 Even on the national account of the Aam Aadmi Party, Kumar's activities are not visible
 jabaki isi acount parpunjab chunaavse sambandhit kaaphi suchanaaen or kaarykram share hote the
 Vandana Singh also called Kumar Vishwas a fraudster, after party leader Dilip Pandey and treasurer Deepak Bajpai, on Monday, the national in-charge of Youth Wing, Vandana Singh also called Kumar Vishwas a fraudster
 vandana ne twitor par likhaa ki subah akhbaar padho to ek aadarneey bade bhai roj party ko bachaane ke naam par party ko hi gaaliyaan dete hai
 Stop cheating on yourself and the party

 Kumar Vishwas you ask questions to the party in interviews and rhetoric

 The sad thing is that nobody seems ready to take account of the condition of Delhi, if you ask, BJP did not get an absolute majority, AAP seems to be the enemy of the times, and Congress's enemy has become Congress itself, it seems This is all Shoaib Iqbal's career
 to kya vajah he ki dilli kaa kuch ho nahin rahaa? koun log hai jo rode atakaate hai, koun nahin chahta dilli main sarkaar bane, Samsung ne kyon rachi he sajeesh, koun hai dilli ke gunaahagaar, ham bataate hai
 Arvind Kejriwal is the first culprit of Delhi, who does not want to form a government in Delhi, after running a government of forty-nine days, one thing has happened to him that running the government is not a children's game, anti-government slogans cannot be raised on the street, blaming After you are not allowed to sit in peace, cannot sit on the dharna, in public hearings people jump towards you like Jonty Rhodes towards the ball, Muffler would trend on Twitter Land, become Facebook posts cough
 aravind kejariwal ke saamne ek samasya or he anna aandolan ke samay se unke gine-chune do-chaar jumale hai jinka istemaal kar-kar wo bhi agha chuke hai, bhaashanon main nayaa kuch kehane ko unke paas he nahin, or unka bhaashan likhane vaala bhi gaayab he uske lautate hi wo chunaavon ke liye taiyaar ho jaaenge, dar unhen is baat kaa bhi he ki kal ko kahin janata maje lene ko unhen phir na jita de, upar-upar se bhale wo kahen ki bijepi chunaavon se batch rahi he, har raat sone ke pehle wo bhagwaan se vish maanate he ki ab ke janam ab chunaav na kijo
 Everyone knows the reason why the Congress is avoiding elections, we also wanted to avoid the class of the master of mathematics, when will we ask seventeen tables? We did not know the multiplication table, they did not know their seats, we were made cock, their poppy became
 roj-roj harkar beijjati karaani kise suhaati he?dilli ke uparajyapal najeeb jang bhi ek kaaran hai ki dilli main sarkaar nahin he, koun jaanata tha dilli main rajyapal nahin uparajyapal hote hai, rajyapalon ko vaise bhi shilanyas, dikshant or shapath grahan samarohon jaise bade kaamon ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he najeeb jang ne kaiyon kaa saamaanya gyaan badha diya, ab wo chunaavon ke baad bhulaae janaa nahin chaahate
 BJP has its own reasons, they are taking away the dilemma of not giving themselves an absolute majority from Delhiites, but if you want to know the real reason for not forming a government in Delhi, then know that the government in Delhi is not formed due to the conspiracy of a multinational company
 Samsung is getting that company
 samsung waalon kaa maananaa he ki jab dilli main LG (up-rajyapal) ho sakate hai to Samsung kyon nahin? Kamlesh Tiwari was strangled and brought a knife to the murder box

 lokapal bill ke civil socity ke sadsy shanti bhushan ne ramlila maidan se bayaan dete hue kaha ki sarkaar ko 30 agast tak lokapal bill paas karne main koi pareshaani nahin he
 He said that the Constitution was amended even when Emergency was imposed in 1975

 There should be heroes from place to place in society so that people are inspired
 bihar ke jayanagar se chalakar nai dilli aane vaali swatantraaa senaanee express pichley kai dinon se rhite time chalane lagi he
 If there is a delay then there is a delay of 2 minutes or 15 minutes
 iske pahunchane main jo deree ho rahi thi usamen kaaphi kami ai he magar abhi bhi yah train 2 se 3 ghante der ho ja rahi he
 The train which has not been running on time in the last several months, has shown a small change by showing it twice at prime time whenever it was delayed by 20 to 30 hours
 ravivaar ko jo dilli se chali thi wo train 15 minute pehle elahabaad pahunch gai
 Passengers and spectators are keeping track of this train whether the railway is actually running the Freedom Fighter Express on a regular basis
 ye hota he darshakon kii jaagrukta kaa kamaal or asar
 You won't believe the record of some trains running late is terrible
 kya koi train 44 ghante der chal sakati he? ravivaar yani 6 may ko upi ke gonda stesan par ek yatri intazaar kar rahe the
 It turned out that the train is 44 hours
 yatra kii taarikh to 5 may thi magar kai baar stesan gaye, phone kiya or ant main pataa chalaa ki train cancil ho gai
 This is the screen shot of the railway website, in which it is clearly written that Gorakhpur Dehradun is late for 44 hours
 phir cancil ho gai he
 If you want to wait for such a train, then you are late for 44 hours
 yahi ek train nahin he
 Talk to railway passengers
 7 ghante se lekar 44 ghante kii deree se chalane vaali train main safar karne vaale yatriyon se baat kiijie, unki pidaa aapse suni nahin jaaegi
 One passenger told that when fed you cancel the ticket because if you do not reach on time, then there is no benefit of going many times, in such a way that the passenger has to bear the loss if you cancel the ticket
 jis tarah se prime time ke baad swatantraaa senaanee express samay par chalane lagi he kya duusari trainon ko bhi samay se chalane kaa gaurav hasil hoga
 a train arrives from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar, Anand Vihar in Delhi, named Seemanchal Superfast
 simanchal ke yatriyon se unki yatra kaa anubhav puuchhie
 Shivank gave some help in this work
 itrain daat info naam kii ek website main simanchal superfast train kaa number 12488 daal dekha to pataa chalaa ki yah train 36-36 ghante kii deree se chali he
 This train has been running late throughout the year while being superfast
 pichley ek saal main 323 din simanchal let chali he, 41 din cancil hui he
 The average latency is 10 hours
 adhiktam 36 ghante let he
 The Simanchal Express from Jogbani on May 5 is running late by 32 hours 36 minutes
 5 se 7 may ho gaya magar jab hamane check kiya tha tab yah train aligarh hi pahunchi thi
 Jogbani-run Seemanchal 12487 will open on May 6 with a delay of 27 hours 20 minutes
 7 may ko jogbani se chalane vaali simanchal 8 may ko ravaanaa hogi, 16 ghante let
 If this is the condition of Superfast that he will be late for 36 hours, then imagine how deep the endurance of the passengers will be
 wo train main baithkar kitni sadhana karte honge, unke bheetar kitna santosh or santulan hoga, kuch nahin hone ko lekar
 Can Railway Minister Piyush Goyal leave all the work and accept the challenge of running the Seemanchal Express on time
 arriya se dilli ke bich na jane kitne saansad hote honge, kisi na kisi ne railmantri ko patr bhi likhaa hoga
 If it was not written, the public would have complained to them, but why is this train running late in this way for a year
 meraa yakeen he ki agar aap sahi sawaal karenge to rail mantri sara kaam chhodkar vaaki simanchal express ko samay se chalava denge
 After this, we will request them to get the Patna Kota Express also run on time
 hamaare sahyogi manish or habib ne patna stesan par jaakar is train or yatriyon kaa haal liya
 There is no problem for the passengers going to Kota at Patna railway station
 patna stesan par kota jane vaale yatriyon kaa rose kaa haal yahi he
 When this train starts from Patna, then how can it open with a delay of 21 hours
 platform par yatri vahiin dhoop or lu main chadar bichhaakar sone ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 These travelers test their endurance daily for how many hours they can wait for Patna Kota today
 is train se kota jane ke liye bihar bhar se yatri patna pahunch kar intazaar karte rahete hai
 If someone misses class, then someone misses the exam
 maa baap or chaatr sab chatpataate rahete hai ki koi inaki train rhite time chalaa de
 In prime time, we will try to leave the railway minister's work and get the Patna Kota Express to run at the right time from tomorrow itself
 unhen do trainon kaa jaldi hi uddhaar karnaa he
 One for Patna Kota Express and the other for Seemanchal Superfast running 36 hours late
 aaiye ab ham aapako patna kota express kaa kuch ricard bataate hai
 Patna Kota Express, which ran on May 1, was delayed by 21 hours from Patna and reached Kota late by 31 hours
 2 may ko paune 17 ghante der se khuli or 19 ghante 50 minute kii deree se kota pahunchi
 On May 3, 9 hours 55 minutes opened late and reached Kota with a delay of 17 hours 20 minutes
 4 may ko patna se 25 ghante kii deree se khuli or kota pahunchi 28 ghante let
 On May 5, the train opened from Patna with a delay of 19 hours and 40 minutes till the news was written
 kya railway main koi aisa he jo patna-kota express or simanchal ko samay par chalava de taaki chaatro ko pareshaani na ho
 This does not mean that two trains run properly to show us and the other trains are late
 ham let hone vaali trainon par series karte rahenge
 Now listen to the agony of passengers traveling by patna-kota Express
 kya pataa rail mantri turant sara kaam chhodkar is train ko kal hi samay par chalava den
 According to e-train
info, the Kota Express is delayed for 43 hours
 ausatan yah 14 ghante let hoti he
 This train has run on time only 2 times in the last one year
 ravivaar ko amritsar jane vaale ek yatri ne bataaya ki intercity band hone se sachkhand express par kaaphi dabaav bad gaya he
 In General Bogi, the passengers are going to fly
 koi neeche so rahaa he to koi chadar baandh kar hawa main lataka he
 He had sent a shoot from mobile with General Bogi and you see what is happening
 is video main ek aadmi dikhegaa jisane hawa main chadar baandh di he or usee main baitha safar kar rahaa he
 Many people ask if this was the case even before
 to pehle bhi reporting hoti thi
 Our own colleagues Parimal and Ravish Ranjan have reported several times inside the train at various times during festivals
 sawaal aaj kaa hona chahie
 Why all these trains are in this condition today
 kyon 36 ghante deree se chal rahi hai
 Is there no cost for the common people? aap rail yatra ke apane anubhavon ko video record kar hamen bhejie
 We will give your feedback to the Ministry of Railways through prime time
 agar koi unka adhikari dekh rahaa hoga to kya pataa train sahi samay par chalane lage
 If you ask the right questions, then the train will run on time
 champaran humsafar express bilkul nai train he
 The Champaran Satyagraha was launched last month itself

 The basic fare from Katihar to New Delhi is Rs 1456
 jab hamane 7 may kii shaam check kiya to dinemic prising system ke kaaran 14 may kaa kiraaya 2155 rupye dikhaa rahaa tha
 On 4 May, this train left for Katihar from Delhi, reaching Katihar, it was 30 hours late
 nai train ke bheetar kaa haal dekhie
 Looks like an old train
 champaran satyagrah kaa sau saal hona kitni badi ghatana he
 If the trains run on this occasion start crawling within a month, then ask yourself if we are remembering Bapu's struggles in this way
 jab samay par nahin chalaa sakate to is train ko chalaane kii zarurat hi kya thi
 It is not that only the train coming from Bihar to Delhi is running late
 hamane abhi aapako gorakhpur dehradun express kaa haal bataaya jo 6 may ke din 44 ghante let ho jane ke kaaran cancil kar di gai

 Then it is canceled

 This is not a train
 rail yatriyon se baat kiijie
 Talk to the passengers traveling in the 7 to 44 hours late train, their pain will not be heard from you
 ek yatri ne bataaya ki jab tang aakar aap tikat cancil karaate hai kyonki aap tay samay par nahin pahunch pate to kai baar jane kaa laabh nahin hota, aise main tikat cancil karaane par nuksaan bhi yatri ko uthaanaa padataa he
 The way the freedom fighter express has started running on time after prime time, will other trains also get the distinction of running on time
 bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se ek train aati he dilli ke anand vihaar, naam he simanchal superfast
 Ask the passengers of Seemanchal their travel experience
 shivank ne is kaam main thodi madad kar di
 When you put the number 12488 of Seemanchal Superfast train in a website called ETRAIN INFO, it was found that this train was delayed by 36-36 hours
 yah train puure saal isi tarah let chalati rahi he jabaki superfast he
 In the last one year, 323 days have been delayed, 41 days have been canceled
 iske let hone kaa ausat 10 ghante he
 Maximum is 36 hours late
 5 may ko jogbani se chali simanchal express 32 ghante 36 minute kii deree se chal rahi he
 It was May 5 to 7, but when we had checked this train reached Aligarh
 6 may ko jogbani se chalane vaali simanchal 12487 27 ghante 20 minute kii deree se khulegi
 Jogbani-run Seemanchal departs on May 8, 16 hours late
 agar superfast kaa yah haal he ki vah 36 ghante let chale to sochie yatriyon kaa dhiraj kitna gaharaa hoga
 How much sadhana will he do sitting in the train, how much satisfaction and balance will be there within him, nothing happens
 kya rail mantri piyush goyal sara kaam chhod kar simanchal express ko samay se chalaane kaa chalange sweekaar kar sakate hai
 How many mps will be there between Araria to Delhi, some one may have even written a letter to the Railway Minister
 na likhaa hoga to janata ne unase shikaayat kii hi hogi, par yah train ek saal se is tarah let kyon chal rahi he
 i am sure that if you ask the right questions, then the Railway Minister will really leave the work and get the Seemanchal Express running in time
 iske baad ham unase guzarish karenge ki ve patna kota express ko bhi samay se chalava den
 Our partners Manish and Habib visited this Patna station and took the condition of this train and passengers
 patna railway stesan par kota jane vaale yatriyon kii takalif kaa haal koi lene vaala nahin he
 This is the daily situation of the passengers going to Kota at Patna station
 yah train jab patna se hi shuru hokar chalati he to phir 21 ghante kii deree se kaise khul sakati he
 Passengers on the platform are forced to sleep by laying sheets in the sun and heat
 ye yatri rose apane dhiraj kii pariksha lete hai ki aaj ve kitne ghante tak patna kota kaa intazaar kar sakate hai
 Passengers from all over Bihar wait for Patna to go to Kota by this train
 kisi kii class chhot jaati he to kisi kii pariksha chhot jaati he
 Parents and students all keep on trying to get someone to run their train right time
 prime time main ham koshish karenge ki rail mantri sara kaam chhod kar kal se hi patna kota express rhite time par chalava den
 They have to deliver two trains soon
 ek patna kota express kaa or doosraa 36 ghante let chalane vaali simanchal superfast kaa

 On May 4, Patna was delayed by 25 hours and reached Kota late by 28 hours
 5 may ko patna se 19 ghante 40 minute deree se khuli or khabar likhane tak yah train safar main thi

 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki hamen dikhaane ke liye do trainen sahi se chalem or baaki trainen or let ho jaaen

 Now i tell you the condition of a train
 lakhanu-chhatrapati shivaji terminus vikali superfast special train 02112 kaa haal dekhie
 The train was supposed to open at 3 pm on 2 May but opens on 3 May
 24 ghante 25 minute kii deree se lakhanu se mumbai ke chhatrapati shivaji terminus ke liye ravaanaa hoti he
 This train could not reach Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, its journey was terminated in Kalyan
 kalyaan pahunchate pahunchate 27 ghante let ho chuki thi
 We went to the Twitter handle of the Railway Minister and saw what the passengers who are upset with the delay are writing to the Railway Minister
 hamane jaakar dekha to 7 may kii shaam 7 baje se 8 baje ke bich 65 ke kareeb logon ne twit kiye jisamen deree kii shikaayat he
 Devendra Khare (@ Devendr34836561) tweeted that Sir we are traveling from Gorakhpur to Jammu
 25 ghante let he
 We were forced to stay in Jammu 24 hours
 mujhe kaam par lautne main deree ho rahi he
 @ arunjaiswal1107 tweeted that Dear @railminindia wake up from sleep
 train number 05228 34 ghante se bhi zyaada let ho chuki he
 Due to this train train number 15228 has been delayed for more than 30 hours
 pichley kuch maheene se yah ho rahaa he
 Do something tippaniyan @ Anshu74556499 Dear Sir, i am happy with the work being done in your ministry but want to bring your attention to the train number 15025 which comes from Mau to Anand Vihar
 yah train 22 ghante 50 minute kii deree se chal rahi he
 @ Shivash05243981 Sir Train No
 12685 Chennai to Mangalore Superfast Express Chennai to 5 pm instead of 5 pm
 15 baje khulne vaali he
 Can you find out the reason and inform me
 kya aap aisi train kaa intazaar karnaa chahenge to 44 ghante let chalati ho
 This is not a train
 rail yatriyon se baat kiijie
 Talk to the passengers traveling in the 7 to 44 hours late train, their pain will not be heard from you
 ek yatri ne bataaya ki jab tang aakar aap tikat cancil karaate hai kyonki aap tay samay par nahin pahunch pate to kai baar jane kaa laabh nahin hota, aise main tikat cancil karaane par nuksaan bhi yatri ko uthaanaa padataa he
 The way the freedom fighter express has started running on time after prime time, will other trains also get the distinction of running on time
 bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se ek train aati he dilli ke anand vihaar, naam he simanchal superfast
 Ask the passengers of Seemanchal their travel experience
 shivank ne is kaam main thodi madad kar di
 When you put the number 12488 of Seemanchal Superfast train in a website called ETRAIN INFO, it was found that this train was delayed by 36-36 hours
 yah train puure saal isi tarah let chalati rahi he jabaki superfast he
 In the last one year, 323 days have been delayed, 41 days have been canceled
 iske let hone kaa ausat 10 ghante he
 Maximum is 36 hours late
 5 may ko jogbani se chali simanchal express 32 ghante 36 minute kii deree se chal rahi he
 It was May 5 to 7, but when we had checked this train reached Aligarh
 6 may ko jogbani se chalane vaali simanchal 12487 27 ghante 20 minute kii deree se khulegi
 Jogbani-run Seemanchal departs on May 8, 16 hours late
 agar superfast kaa yah haal he ki vah 36 ghante let chale to sochie yatriyon kaa dhiraj kitna gaharaa hoga
 How much sadhana will he do sitting in the train, how much satisfaction and balance will be there within him, nothing happens
 kya rail mantri piyush goyal sara kaam chhod kar simanchal express ko samay se chalaane kaa chalange sweekaar kar sakate hai
 How many mps will be there between Araria to Delhi, some one may have even written a letter to the Railway Minister
 na likhaa hoga to janata ne unase shikaayat kii hi hogi, par yah train ek saal se is tarah let kyon chal rahi he
 i am sure that if you ask the right questions, then the Railway Minister will really leave the work and get the Seemanchal Express running in time
 iske baad ham unase guzarish karenge ki ve patna kota express ko bhi samay se chalava den
 Our partners Manish and Habib visited this Patna station and took the condition of this train and passengers
 patna railway stesan par kota jane vaale yatriyon kii takalif kaa haal koi lene vaala nahin he
 This is the daily situation of the passengers going to Kota at Patna station
 yah train jab patna se hi shuru hokar chalati he to phir 21 ghante kii deree se kaise khul sakati he
 Passengers on the platform are forced to sleep by laying sheets in the sun and heat
 ye yatri rose apane dhiraj kii pariksha lete hai ki aaj ve kitne ghante tak patna kota kaa intazaar kar sakate hai
 Passengers from all over Bihar wait for Patna to go to Kota by this train
 kisi kii class chhot jaati he to kisi kii pariksha chhot jaati he
 Parents and students all keep on trying to get someone to run their train right time
 prime time main ham koshish karenge ki rail mantri sara kaam chhod kar kal se hi patna kota express rhite time par chalava den
 They have to deliver two trains soon
 ek patna kota express kaa or doosraa 36 ghante let chalane vaali simanchal superfast kaa
 Let us now tell you some records of Patna Kota Express
 1 may ko chalane vaali patna kota express patna se 21 ghante let chali or kota 31 ghante kii deree se pahunchi
 On 2 May, the quarter opened 17 hours late and reached Kota with a delay of 19 hours 50 minutes
 3 may ko 9 ghanta 55 minute der se khuli or kota pahunchi 17 ghanta 20 minute kii deree se
 On May 4, Patna was delayed by 25 hours and reached Kota late by 28 hours
 5 may ko patna se 19 ghante 40 minute deree se khuli or khabar likhane tak yah train safar main thi
 Is there anyone in the railway who can get the patna-kota Express and Seemanchal run on time so that students do not face any trouble
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki hamen dikhaane ke liye do trainen sahi se chalem or baaki trainen or let ho jaaen
 We will continue to do series on late trains
 ab aap patna-kota express se safar karne vaale yatriyon kii vyathaa suniye
 What does the Railway Minister immediately leave all the work and get this train run on time tomorrow itself
 i train daat info ke mutabik kota express 43 ghante tak let hui he
 On average it is 14 hours late
 pichley ek saal main sirf 2 baar yah train time par chali he
 a passenger going to Amritsar on Sunday said that the pressure on the Sachkhand Express has increased due to the closure of the Intercity
 general bogi main yatri kisi tarah ladaa fada ke ja rahe hai
 If someone is sleeping down, someone is tied up in a sheet and hangs in the air
 general bogi se unhone mobile se shoot kar bheja tha aap dekhie kya haal he
 In this video, a man will be seen who has tied a sheet in the air and is sitting in it
 kai log poochhate hai ki pehle bhi to aisa tha
 So earlier there was reporting
 hamaare hi sahyogi parimal or raveesh ranjan ne kai dfa tyoharon ke samay railgadee ke bheetar ke haal kii reportig kii he
 The question should be of today
 aaj kyon ye sari trainen is haalat main hai
 Why are 36 hours delayed
 kya aam logon ke vakt kii koi keemat nahin he
 You can record your experiences of train travel and send it to us
 ham aapkaa feedback prime time ke zarie rail mantralay ko denge
 If someone is watching their officer, then do you know the train started running at the right time
 agar aap sahi sawaal puuchhenge to train samay par chal kar rahegi

 According to e-train

 ausatan yah 14 ghante let hoti he
 This train has run on time only 2 times in the last one year
 ravivaar ko amritsar jane vaale ek yatri ne bataaya ki intercity band hone se sachkhand express par kaaphi dabaav bad gaya he
 In General Bogi, the passengers are going to fly

 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the only Muslim minister to make his place in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, has said that the government's victory over triple talaq does not mean that the Common Civil Code will soon be introduced in the country
 cabinet mantri ke taur par somvaar ko apane hi alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantralay main charge lene ke baad nakvi ye baaten kahi
 He further said that the Common Civil Code will not be imposed on the country and an attempt will be made to form a consensus first to bring it
 unhone kaha ki ye koi aisi chiz nahin he jise achaanak lagu kar diya jaae
 Let us know that Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi is one of the four ministers whose Prime Minister Narendra Modi, happy with his work, has given him the status of cabinet by promoting him
 unheen ke saath aaj rajya mantri ke taur par madhya pradesh se aane vaale virendra kumaar ne bhi padbhaar grahan kiya
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was the first minister with independent charge in the Ministry of Minority Affairs while Virender Kumar became the minister for the first time
 jab nakvi se poocha gaya ki apane pramotion ko vah kis tarah se dekhte hai or kya unhen teen talaak khatm karaane ke liye maahaul banane kaa inaam mila he to unhone kaha ki is mantralay ko pehle ek halkaa-phulka mantralay mana jaataa tha, lekin unhone koshish kii ki sarkaar kii yojanaayen jameen par utre or pradhanmantri kaa sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa naaraa sahi sabit ho sake
 Not to be named in the name of cow protection, Virender Kumar, who took charge as Minister of State with him, has been working for cow protection before and was associated with many institutions for cow protection in Madhya Pradesh
 khaas baat yah he ki gau rakshakon dwaara hinsa ko lekar kai baar vivaad ho chukaa he or khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ko baar-baar yah baat kehani padi ki gauraksha ke naam par hinsa bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 When asked about this, Naqvi said that in states where there is a law regarding cow slaughter, this will be strictly followed
 unhone kaha ki bhaawanaaon se jude muddon par logon ko samvedansheel hona chahie lekin saath hi yah bhi jaruri he ki gau raksha ke naam par koi hinsa nahin ho
 When Naqvi was asked that all the people alleged that the atmosphere in the country is such that there is fear in the minds of the minorities, then he said that there is no truth in this matter and this thing is just some people of the opposition's lament congregation They keep repeating
 rajya mantri ke taur alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantralay main kaarybhaar sanbhaalane vaale virendra kumaar ne kaha ki bhale hi vah gau raksha ke liye kaam karte rahe ho lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki mantri ke taur par unke kaam karne main koi baadha aegi
 He said that no violence can be justified even if it is in the name of cow protection

 In the second round of Chhattisgarh, voting is going on in 19 districts, but in Bilaspur and Raipur divisions, the real test is for Jiga Ajit Jogi and Mayawati more than the Congress and BJP
 ye ilaaka satamani samaaj kaa belt kehalaata he or jogi kaa yahaan khaasaa prabhaav he
 Ajit Jogi's role is considered to be very important in this era
 is daur kii siton par nattejey unhen kingmekar bhi bana sakate hai
 By aligning with the BSP, Jogi has given sleep to both Congress and BJP
 aise main congress kaa kahana he ki jogi bijepi ko nuksaan pahunch rahe hai
 At the same time, BJP leaders believe that there is a loss to the Congress
 jogi or mayawati kaa sabase zyada prabhaav bilaspur, jaanjgir-champa or mungeli jile kii 15 siton par he

 ye siten pradesh kii satta main kaaphi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati hai, jin ilaakon main ye siten hai, unamem ajit jogi kaa asar mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that this time all the three parties are pushing their heads on these seats spread in areas like Surguja, Bilaspur, Korba, Ambikapur
 bijepi ko jahaan congress or janata congress ke bich vot bantane kii ummid he to vahiin congress or janata congress ko lag rahaa he ki is baar bijepi kaa safaya hoga
 Actually, Congress is looking strong in tribal areas, then Ajit Jogi and Mayawati are seeing the effect on Scheduled Caste seats
 aise main agar janata congress va bispi gathbandhan ne apeksha ke anurup pradarshan kiya to is baar satta kii chaabi unke haath bhi aa sakati he
 Let the Congress know that Ajit Jogi was its face in the last three elections, but it has not been able to oust Raman Singh from power
 haalanki muqabla kaaphi najdiki rahaa he
 This time the Congress is taking on the BJP without Jogi
 jabaki jogi ne basapa ke saath milakar nateezon ko prabhavit karke is baar kingmekar banane kii koshish main he

 isamen herapheri kii bahut gunjaaish he or bahari tatwon kaa bahut prabhaav pad saktaa he
 This apprehension was not unfounded and seems to be happening to a large extent
 srisanth jaise kai bade khilaadi iske jaal main funs bhi gaye or apana kariyar hi chaupat kar gaye
 Fingers were also raised on the owners of several teams
 lekin sabase bada dhakka to tab laga jab pataa chalaa ki bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke shaktishaalee president en shrinivasana ke damaad bhi isse jude hue hai
 He was also asked to resign on this basis, but he rejected that legitimate demand and remained in his post
 unhone ek jaanch bhi karwaai
 Clearly, when he was firmly in that powerful position, how could any inquiry be fair
 ab jabaki supreme court ne kah diya he ki shrinivasana ke pad par bane rahete koi bhi jaanch nishpaksh nahin ho sakati or unhen iske liye istipha de dena chahie tobisisiai chif ke paas koi or rasta nahin rah jaataa
 If he does not do so, he may face the whip of the Supreme Court, just like Subrata Roy
 ab shrinivasana ko istipha dena hi hoga
 Only then will there be an impartial investigation into the spot-fixing case in the IPL
 bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ek aisa khel sanghathan he jiske paas na keval beshumaar paisa he balki paisa kamaane ke uske paas raste bhi hai
 This is not the first time that there has been a finger pointing at the people at the top positions
 ipel main to kaiyon par ungliyaan uthin, jinamein se lalit modi to abhi tak videsh main baithe hue hai
 But this case is even bigger in which the BCCI President's son-in-law is accused of making money illegally and doing illegal work
 itnaa hi nahin is jaanch ke aadhaar par sakht karrvai bhi honi chahie taaki desh kaa sabase popular khel sadaa ke liye badnaam na ho jaae
 It has to be saved from tainted people so that the trust of crores of cricket lovers is not hurt
 ab yah samay aa gaya he ki is khel kii gandagi ko sadaa ke liye dur kar diya jaae
 It is just beginning
 aage-aage dekhie

 ) padosi desh china main nagarikon kaa sibar aparaadh karnaa koi nai baat nahin he
 Even Chinese citizens are often behind cyber crimes worldwide
 haal hi main chini sarkaar ne is maamle main sakht kadam uthaate hue 1900 se zyada sandigdh sibar aparaadhiyon ko hiraasat main liya he
 In fact, being troubled by rising cyber crimes, the Chinese government launched a special campaign against cyber criminals in April
 usase pehle vahaan police ko 750 se zyada sibar sambandhi shikaayatein mili thi
 In which people had the highest number of complaints about making their personal information or private photos public
 is shikaayat ko gambhirtha se lete hue china kii sibar police ne 23 billian se zyada nijee soochnaaon ko sij kiya or 3 lakh 52 hajaar se zyada avaidh content ko delit karavaaya
 According to the Chinese Ministry, most of the complaints have reported incidents of password hacking of bank accounts and social networking profiles through malware or Trojan viruses
 china main sibar aparaadh se nagarikon ko blackmel karne or bank acount se paise udaane kii ghatnaon main kaaphi ijapha hua he
 The Chinese government, taking action after all these complaints, has arrested over 1900 suspected cyber criminals
 iske alaava sarkaar 610 se zyada websites par bhi paini najar banaae hue he
 The fire of attack on Dalits in Koregaon Bhima in Maharashtra has not cooled down yet that a new problem has come before the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Center
 20 march ko anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati (atyaachaar nivaaran) adhinium-1989 ko lekar supreme court ke faisle ne ek baar phir se in samudaayon ko naaraaz kar diya he
 In fact, a bench of Justices Adarsh kumar Goel and Uday Umesh Lalit in the Supreme Court in their judgment said that anticipatory bail can be granted in cases registered under this Act
 yahi nahin, supreme court ke mutabik, agar vah sarkari karmchaaree he to uski giraftaar se pehle uske apvainting athurity or anya saamaanya logon ke liye varisht police adheekshak kii anumati leni hogi
 Earlier there was neither anticipatory bail nor approval for arrest
 is faisle kaa asar agle hi din najar aayaa or gujarat hycourt ne sabarkantha jile ke jader thane ke dalit utpeeda ke cese main savarna samudaay ke 15 aropiyon ko agrim jamaanat de di
 Obviously, there is a lot of outrage among the Dalits and tribals about the Supreme Court's decision
 vibhinn jagahon par isko lekar virodh-pradarshan hua he
 Nitin Meshram, a lawyer in the Supreme Court, says, "the Supreme Court does not have the right to give such a judicial decision
" yah desh ke samvidhan ke khilaaf jaakar diya gaya faisla he
 Sensing the generosity of this decision, the Congress attacked the government without delay and demanded a review petition against it in the Supreme Court
 party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha, ''bhaajapa sangh kii maansikta ke tahat essi-asti samudaay ke khilaaf kaam kar rahi he or is kanoon ko khatm karne kii soch rahi he
 "but the Opposition is not the only one making this demand, but the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), an NDA ally in the BJP government, filed a review petition in the Supreme Court on 26 March
 lojpa netaa ramvilas paswan ne sweekaar kiya ki daliton ke hiton ke liye sarkaar ko is masale par uchit kadam uthaanaa chahie (dekhen intervyuu)
 In BJP itself too, voices of protest have started emerging on the issues of Dalits
 bhaajapa saansad udit raaj ne india today se kaha, ''supreme court ke faisle ko lekar daliton-adivaasiyon main deshbhar main baari aakrosh he
 i have sought time to meet the Prime Minister on this issue
 '' court ne apane faisle main is kanoon ke durupyog kii bhi baat kahi thi
 But Sukhdev Thorat, former chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC), does not consider the abuse to be based on facts: "the Supreme Court has not taken into account the socio-economic condition of the Dalits and tribals while giving this ruling
" unki haalat itani kharaab he ki unhen nyaay nahin mil paata
 Flaws are left in the case and the accused are left
 ''vidambnaa hi he ki kareeb dhai saal pehle modi sarkaar ne is kanoon ko daliton-adivaasiyon ke hiton main or kadaa banaate hue sanshodhan-2015 kiya tha
 Thorat and Meshram believe that the Dalits and Adivasis were not able to get social security and justice, only then the government had made amendments
 meshram sawaal karte hai, ''adaalat ne phir essi-asti ayog ko kyon nahin aankade pesh karne ke liye bulaayaa or usko kyon nahin suna?'' udit raaj jahaan is faisle ko jati purvaagrah se prerit bataate hai, meshram nyaayadhishon par purvaagrah se grasit hone kaa aarope tak lagaate hai, ''nyaaypalika main maujuud agadi jati ke nyaayadhish supreme court kii shaktiyon kaa durupyog kar rahe hai or sanvaidhanik mulyon se itar jaakar bhi faisle de rahe hai
 "they raise questions about the participation and perceived discrimination of Dalits-tribals-minorities in the judiciary
" shaayad isi vajah se paswan bhartiya nyaayik seva ke gathan kii maang kar rahe hai
 People of SC-ST community are also angry with the government about reservation (see box)
 darasal, vishvavidhyalayon main vibhaag yaa vishay ke aadhaar par aarakshan lagu karne ko lekar sarkaar kaam kar rahi he or mana ja rahaa he ki isse aarakshan par vipareet prabhaav padegaa, kyonki vibhaag yaa vishay ke aadhaar par siten behad kam nikalati hai
 At the same time, students' eyebrows have been raised on the mandatory 50 percent number in the written examination for admission to mphil and phd
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) main birsa ambedkar phule students association ke chaatr netaa rahul sonpimple kehete hai, ''ujisi kii adhisuchana asanvaidhanik he
 Despite this, it is being forcibly implemented
 '' aarakshan ke masalon par bhi virodh-pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Alam is that on 28 March, BJP MP Savitribai Phule blew the trumpet against the government saying that there was a conspiracy to end the reservation
 unhone aarakshan bachaane ke liye andolan kaa bhi elaan kiya
 At the same time, BJP is in a fix due to the political consequences of the Supreme Court's decision on the Scheduled Castes and Tribes Act
 vah akalan karne main juty he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se kya phydemand ho saktaa he
 According to sources, a section of the party is serious about putting the ball in the court court by filing a review petition in the Supreme Court
 unka maananaa he ki agar sarkaar is faisle ko palatwane kii jugat main dikhi to uski paramparaagat voter agadi jatiyaan naaraaz ho jaaengi
 The other section believes that in the last elections, the SC-ST community has left its traditional parties and turned to the BJP, if they turn away from the BJP, the party may suffer heavy losses in the next elections
 haalanki kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki sarkaar essi-asti logon kii suraksha ko lekar gambhir he
 Prasad says, "the government will consider what the court has said in light of it
" sabhi vikalp khule hai or ham uchit samay par nirnay lenge
 "of the four states where assembly elections are due this year, 231 seats are reserved for SC-ST, while 25 seats in these states are reserved for them in Lok Sabha
 aise main agar pradesh sarkaar in masalon ko jald nahin sulajhaatin to aane vaala vakt unke liye mahangaa bhi pad saktaa he
 Obviously, the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown love for Dalits from the 2014 elections to the recent times is also a test
 *** Kapil Sharma is in discussion these days

 During the course of the match, Kapil tightened his arms against Sunil

 Indian men's and women's teams Virat Kohli and Harmanpreet Kaur welcomed the initiative along with South Africa captain Faf du Plessis
 kohli ne kaha, ‚Äò tii-20 cricket ke sabase bade toornament ko ab vishwa cap kaha jayega, jo ki sahi naam he
 India won the first T20 World Cup in 2007 and it would be fantastic for us to win the 2020 World Cup in Australia
 ‚Äôharmanpreet ne kaha, ‚Äòmain aashwast hum ki aane vaale varshon main is toornament kii lokapriyata main ijapha hoga
 "du Plessis said," Every player's dream is to play in the World Cup and this initiative will give more players such an opportunity
 ‚Äô Before the General Election 2014, Narendra Modi's contender for the post of the Prime Minister of the Bharatiya Janata Party promised that after coming to power, he will bring back the deposits of foreign banks
 ab modi sarkaar satta main apana kaarykaal puraa kar rahi he, lekin videsh se kaledhan ke sawaal par sarkaar ke paas jawaab nahin he
 Now the issue of bringing back black money from abroad has been raised in Pakistan, but unlike India, this promise is being made after forming Imran Khanki government in Pakistan
 padosi desh pakistan main haal main hue chunaavon ke baad taharik-e-pakistan kii imran sarkaar bani he
 Former cricket star Imran Khan is the Prime Minister and Asad Umar is the new Finance Minister of Pakistan
 asad umr ne sarkaar banane ke baad daawa kiya he ki maujuuda samay main pakistan kaa lagbhag dhai lakh karod rupee pakistani nagarikon ke naam par videshi bainkon or tex haven main padaa he
 Assad has promised that it is the priority of the Imran government to bring this money from foreign banks to Pakistan as soon as possible and spend it in the development of Pakistan
 gauratlab he ki 2014 ke aam chunaavon se pehle narendra modi ne bhi daawa kiya tha ki videshi bainkon main bhartiya nagarikon kaa lagbhag 1
 4 lakh crore rupees black money is hidden
 is daawey ke saath modi ne vaada kiya ki sarkaar banane ke baad yah unki praathamikta hogi ki videsh main jamaa puraa kalaadhan waapas laayaa jayega or desh ke vikaas par kharch kiya jayega
 In such a situation, is the Imran government in Pakistan trying to communicate with its people exactly as Prime Minister Modi in India has increased its popularity in the country
 ise padhein: girtaa rupaya-badhati mahangaai, paak kii girti iconomi ko sambhaal paaenge imran?pakistan ke vitt mantri ne mana ki philhal unhen yaa unki sarkaar ko yah nahin pataa ki pakistani nagarikon kaa kitna kalaadhan videshi bainkon main padaa he
 However, citing Dubai Real Estate Authority, Omar said that about 1400 crore rupees of Pakistani nationals have been illegally invested in Dubai's real estate
 lihaaja is paise samet videsh main pade kaledhan kii ek-ek pai waapas laai jaaegi
 There is another special thing on the issue of black money of both countries
 modi sarkaar ne may 2014 main kaman sanbhaalane ke baad pehali cabinet baithak main kaledhan or bhrashtachar par lagaam ke liye specian invastigeshan team kaa gathan kiya
 Now in 2018, Imran Khan, in his first cabinet meeting after assuming the reins of the Government of Pakistan, formed the task force and gave him the responsibility to calculate the money collected through corruption for decades and the way to bring it back to Pakistan Prepare gauratlab he ki purv sarkaar ke kaarykaal main vitt mantri ishaak dhar ne pakistani sansad main daawa kiya tha ki pakistani nagarikon kaa dhai lakh karod rupee tex chori ke saath videshi bainkon main jamaa he
 However, now it remains to be seen whether this exercise in Pakistan is merely to increase the popularity of Imran Khan, then the Imran government is really trying to get Pakistan out of decades of corruption

 jabaki shahpur thane ke prabharee sanjay pathak ne pehle kaha tha "subhash coli ne somvaar ko gaanv main paak kii jeet par desh virdohi naare lagane kii shikaayat kii thi
 On the basis of the complaint, a case was registered against 15 people under sections 120B (conspiracy) and 124A (anti-national activity)
 ' Police are now saying that he is not aware of Koli's claims
 agar aupchaarik shikaayat ai to ve jaanch karenge
 SP RRS Parihar said that the information we have, even when the police reached there, the accused were bursting firecrackers
 unhen range haath pakadaa he
 The person who gave the first notice is a complainant
 agar kuch tathy aage mili to ham jaanch karaayenge
 However, the claims of the police are still being questioned
 darasal, police ne jis shikayatakarta kii shikaayat par maamla darj karne kaa daawa kiya he vah khud kah rahaa he ki usne aisi koi shikaayat nahin kii
 He was not even present in the village that day
 tippaniyan Burhanpur police has made Subhash Koli the main complainant in the case but in a conversation with NDTV, Koli said he was forcibly made a witness
 unhone kaha ki unhone police ko suchit nahin kiya tha
 He went to the police station on Sunday to help a neighbor who was taken to the police on charges of raising slogans
 somvaar ko vah thane main tha isliye police ne use hi gavaah bana diya
 Koli said that day, slogans were raised but 'vande Mataram' and 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' were raised
 subhash coli kaa pesha dish antina thik karnaa he
 His complaint is that the police registered a case of treason against 15 people of his village Mohag after taking false statements from him, even though he was not present in the village that day
 coli ne baqayada ab court main halafanama dekar kaha he ki police ne 15 yuvakon ke khilaaf jhootha cese gadha he
 Whereas in-charge of Shahpur police station, Sanjay Pathak had earlier said "subhash Koli complained on Monday about raising anti-national slogans on Pakistan's victory in the village
 shikaayat ke aadhaar par 15 logon ke khilaaf dhara 120bi (sajeesh) or 124e (desh virdohi gatividhi) ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 ' police ab kah rahi he ki use coli ke daavon ke bare main nahin pataa

 burhanpur police ne maamle main subhash coli ko mukhya shikayatakarta banaaya he lekin enditivi ke saath baatcheet main coli ne kaha unhen jabaran gavaah banaaya gaya he
 He said that he had not informed the police
 vah ravivaar ko ek padosi kii madad karne ke liye thane gaya the jise naare lagane ke aarope main police le gai thi
 On Monday, he was in the police station, so the police made him a witness
 coli ne kaha us din naare lage lekin 'vande maataram' or 'bharat mata kii jai' ke naare lage
 Subhash Koli's profession is to fix the dish antenna

 The victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Assam is the biggest news of the elections of five states
 assam chunaavon ke dauraan chape tamaam vishleshanon ko aap padhenge to unamem isi baat kaa zikr milegaa ki assam kii raajnneeti kii apni jatilta he
 The battle for the Bharatiya Janata Party is not easy due to the social diversity there
 agar un vishleshanon ko sahi maane to is lihaaj se bhi bijepi kii jeet badi ho jaati he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party's victory in Assam has lifted her from the psychological pressure she felt after the defeat of Delhi and Bihar
 126 siton kii vidhansabha main akele bhartiya janata party ko 61 siten mili hai
 The party has almost touched 63 figures of the government alone
 uske donon sahyogi dalon kaa bhi pradarshan acha rahaa he
 AGP has got 14 seats and Bodo Land has got 12 seats
 2011 ke nateezon se tulana karen to bijepi 5 se 61 par pahunchi he
 The AGP has got just 4 seats more than the previous assembly
 bodo land pipuls front ke paas 12 siten thim
 Has got 12 seats
 yani siton ke maamle main bhartiya janata party kaaphi phaayde main rahi he
 The Congress was in the fray with 78 seats but lost to 25
 badaruddin ajmal kii party 18 siton ke saath maidan main utari thi magar 13 par rah gai
 Ajmal's party lost less but Congress was electrocuted
 2014 ke loksabhaa ke hisaab se assam kii 14 main se bijepi ne 7 siten jiti thim or 36
 Won 8 percent of the votes
 bijepi ne is baar gathbandhan kii vajah se siten bhale hi acchhee jiti hon lekin vot pratishat uskaa gira he
 Him 29
 5 fisadi vot mili hai
 The Congress did not learn from Bihar and formed an alliance
 bijepi ne kaha he ki usne bihar se siikhaa or gathbandhan kiya
 Sarbananda Sonowal, who came to the BJP in 2011 from AGP and Himanta Vishwa Sharma from Congress in 2015, has a big role behind the Assam victory
 raajnneeti kaa karishma dekhie ki jo assam gana parishad is chunaav main bijepi kii partner he, usee kaa purv netaa mukhyamantri banane ja rahaa he
 ex-chief Minister Prafulla Mahanta Sonowal may work as an aide in the cabinet
 himanta phir se up mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 In 2011, Sonowal left the AGP on the question of his proximity to Praful Mahanta to Ajmal and joined the BJP
 ek saal ke bheetar bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ban gaye
 That is, till 2012, the BJP had such a shortage of its leaders that a person from another party becomes the state president within a year
 2014 main bijepi saansad banate hai or centre main mantri
 The Congress could not rely so much on its old leader Himanta Visa Sarma
 udhar bijepi jis himanta vishwa par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaati rahi, use apane paale main le leti he
 According to Economic Times and DNA news in April, Amit Shah has said in a press conference that any allegations of corruption against Himanta will be investigated
 akhbaar ne pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi he
 Until September 2015, Himanta was in the Congress
 bijepi kaa kamaal yah rahaa ki usne sarbanand ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or himanta ko vidroh bhi nahin karne diya
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has laid the foundation on the leadership of credit
 bijepi ne duusare dalon se aae sirf 14 ummidavaaron ko hi tikat diya, baaki uske apane hi ummidavaar rahe
 Those who study the politics of the state are also giving credit to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh for laying the foundation of this victory
 aakhir kya kiya aresas ne
 We spoke to a senior member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh who has worked in Assam
 sirf itnaa bataanaa kaaphi nahin he ki sangh ne bahut mehnat kii, mehnat main kya kiya yah jaanane ke liye jab baatcheet kii to kai baaten nikalakar ain
 There are around 590 Saraswati Shishu temples in Assam
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool hai
 These schools run in remote areas
 inke liye shikshak kii training sangh detaa he
 These teachers are equipped with the ideology of the union
 in shikshakon ko paanch hajaar kaa maandey sangh apane str se detaa he, logon or sansthaaon se chanda lekar
 More than 100 hostels run within Assam for students from the Northeast
 bharat main koi bhi aisi sanstha nahin he jiske paas ek rajya main itane skool hon
 No private institution can match the association in this case
 akele assam main sangh kii is vakt kareeb saadhe baarah sau shakhaaen chalati hai
 Another organization of the Sangh does a lot of work here, namely Seva Bharati
 baatcheet main pataa chalaa ki seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 These are called health guards
 sangh inhen homeopathy or prakritik chikitsa kaa prashikshan detaa he jo unke rojgaar kaa bhi zariyaa ban jaataa he
 The Sangh takes out eight days of Ghanvantari Seva Yatra every year for 14 years
 isamen desh bhar se kareeb 200 embibies doctor laae jate hai
 Their teams camp in different areas for eight-eight days
 or ek trek dawa logon se mangakar garibon main banti jaati he
 The Sangh worker said that we influence people with our ideology and service
 kise vot dena he kabhi nahin kehete, lekin raajnneeti main koi ulta pulta karegaa to us par najar rakhana bhi hamaara kaam he
 Fifteen and twenty thousand activists associated with all the institutions themselves understand their responsibility at the time of elections
 khaskar jab unke sanghathan ko gaali di jaati he tab ve us taraf to kabhi matdaan nahin karenge jinase gaali padati he
 In this conversation, an interesting thing came to know that this time the Assam authorities were very angry
 jaise math hota he usee tarah assam main satr hota he
 The abbot is called an authority there
 assam ke satron kii jameen par bangladeshi musalamaanon ke kabze ke kaaran naaraazgi badi he
 Officials have also expressed their displeasure over the targeting of the Sangh
 dhai sau satradhikaron ne parivartan kii baat kahi thi
 Devotion, dance, music teaching, training runs in these sessions
 sangh ko chunauti dene vaale yaa sangh mukt bharat kii baat karne waalon ko kya sangh ke is dhaanche or kaaryakartaaon kii patibaddhta kaa ilm he
 It is not that this foundation of the Sangh always gives BJP victory but if the fight is to fight the Sangh then what is the preparation of the fighters
 is baar 250 satradhikaron yani dharmik mathadhish parivartan kii baat chalaane lage
 The series of devotees associated with these monasteries weakened the Congress base within
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya congress kabhi in satradhikaron ke jariye naram hindutv kii raajnneeti karti thi
 When we asked this question that it is so powerful, why couldn't we first make a change in bjp's favor
 iske jawaab main yah bataaya gaya ki bangladeshi musalamaanon ke prati congress sarkaar kii sahansheeltaa se log aajiz aa gaye the or sangh ko target kiye jane se yah naaraaz ho gaye
 The BJP continued to raise the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims at the national level, but it could not make it to Assam
 is bich badaruddin ajmal kii party ban gai or lagaataar siten jeetne lagi
 This time Ajmal himself has lost the election, defeating Congress candidate Wajid Ali Chaudhary by 16,723 votes
 agar congress isi tarah ajmal ko saamne se chunauti detii to us par muslim sampradayikta ke poshan kaa aarope nahin lagata
 Experts say that Ajmal encouraged Muslim communalism, in response to which the Congress was forced to move towards soft Hindutva
 lekin yahi ajmal 2009 main upie ko baahar se samarthan bhi de rahe the
 If the Congress had been serious about Hindutva-based communalism, it would have also fought Muslim communalism
 haalanki ajmal kehete hai ki unki party sirf musalamaanon kii party nahin hai
 Also gives tickets to people of other religions
 ab sangh kaa kahana he ki bijepi sarkaar ko bangladeshi musalamaanon kii pahchaan kar unhen baahar bhejnaa hoga
 Will the BJP really identify and remove Muslims on such a large scale? sangh kii maane to is aadhaar par uski sarkaar kii pariksha honi he
 BJP fielded 9 Muslim candidates, only two could win
 jammu-kashmir main sabase adhik musalmaan hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Thereafter in Assam, there is a BJP government
 tippaniyan In Assam, the Bharatiya Janata Party has also dispelled the myth of the Muslim vote
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kaha jaataa tha ki upi main itani siten muslim bahul hai
 Even after this, BJP won more than 70 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 upi main virdohi dalon ke alag ladane se laabh mila jaise assam main mila
 In Assam too, if Congress and AUDF were to fight together, the vote percentage of both would be higher than BJP
 congress ne na to ajmal ko khulkar chunauti di na hi haath milaayaa
 You can gauge the strength of Muslim votes in Assam from the fact that once the Maulana Asad Madni of Jamiat Ulema Hind had said that the Congress government was toppled if its 18 demands were not met
 aaj assam main jo sarkaar ban rahi he usamen na to ajmal kaa asar he na madani kaa
 The BJP weakened the electoral strength of the Muslim vote by its strategy
 assam kii jeet bijepi ke liye badi he
 The Prime Minister is being welcomed in the Assam tradition at the BJP headquarters
 jab pradhanmantri banakar narendra modi bijepi daftar main aae the tab unhone devdas apte kaa naam liya tha
 This is the same Apte who went to Assam from Nagpur in 1963 as a Jan Sangh pracharak
 jab pradhanmantri apane raajnneetik prashikshan ke daur main dilli aae the tab apte ji hi bijepi mukhyalay ke incharge the
 Nana ji took Deshmukh Apte from Awadh Tirhut Mail to Assam
 apte ji abhi 80 saal ke hai lekin 24 saal kii umr main assam gaye the
 When he spoke to Apte, he told that it took a long time to convince Assam about the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims
 apte ji ne 1964 main anti infiltreshan cameti banaai
 The capital of Assam was then Shillong
 vahaan kii librari se sensos kii report lekar aae
 Praja Socialist Party MLA Madhusudan Das was associated with this issue
 apte ji is jeet par khush hai
 The Sangh is not involved in this scene of victory but it is not his victory
 uske apano kii hi khushi he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party alone won 61 seats in the 126-seat assembly
 kareeb-kareeb party ne akele hi sarkaar banane ke 63 ke aankadon ko chhu liya he
 Both its allies have also performed well
 agypi ko 14 or bodo land ko 12 siten mili hai
 Compared to the results of 2011, BJP has risen from 5 to 61
 agypi ko pichhali vidhansabha kii tulana main sirf 4 siten adhik mili hai
 The Bodo Land People's Front had 12 seats
 12 siten mili hai
 That is, the Bharatiya Janata Party has been in great advantage in terms of seats
 congress 78 siton ke saath maidan main utari thi lekin haar kar 25 par aa gai
 Badruddin Ajmal's party contested with 18 seats but remained at 13
 ajmal kii party ko nuksaan kam hua magar congress ko karant maar gaya
 According to the 2014 Lok Sabha, out of 14 seats in Assam, BJP won 7 and 36
 8 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 BJP may have won the seats this time due to the alliance, but the vote percentage has dropped
 use 29
 Got 5 percent votes
 congress ne bihar se nahin siikhaa or gathbandhan nahin kiya
 The BJP has said that it learned from Bihar and formed an alliance
 assam kii jeet ke peeche agypi se 2011 main bijepi main aae sarbanand sonoval or 2015 main congress se bhartiya janata party main aae himanta vishwa sharma ke janaadhar kii badi bhoomika he
 Look at the charisma of politics that the former leader of the Assam Gana Parishad, which is the bjp's partner in this election, is going to become the Chief Minister
 ho saktaa he ki purv mukhyamantri prafull mahanta sonoval mantrimandal main sahyogi kii tarah kaam karen
 Himanta may again become Deputy Chief Minister
 2011 main sonoval prafull mahanta se ajmal se najdiki ke sawaal par agypi chhod bijepi main aa gaye
 Became state president of BJP within a year
 yani 2012 tak bijepi ke paas apane netaaon kaa itnaa abhaav tha ki duusare dal se aayaa vyakti saal bhar ke bheetar pradesh adhyaksh ban jaataa he
 In 2014, BJP mps are formed and ministers at the Center
 itnaa bharosa congress apane hi puraane netaa himanta vishsa sarma par nahin kar pai
 On the other hand, Himanta Vishwa, who has been accusing the BJP of corruption, takes it into his court
 isi april main iconamik times or diene kii khabar ke anusaar ek press conference main amit shah ne kaha he ki himanta ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke jo bhi aarope lage hai uski jaanch hogi
 The newspaper has quoted the news quoting PTI
 sitambar 2015 tak himanta congress main hi the
 The great thing of the BJP is that it made Sarbananda the candidate for the chief minister and did not even allow Himanta to revolt
 udhaar ke netritv par aadhaar taiyaar kiya he rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne
 BJP gave tickets to only 14 candidates from other parties, the rest were its own candidates
 rajya kii raajnneeti kaa adhyayan karne vaale rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko bhi is jeet kii buniyaad daalane kaa shrey de rahe hai
 After all, what did the RSS do? assam main kaam kar chuke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke ek varisht sadsy se hamane baat kii
 It is not enough to tell just that the Sangh worked very hard, many things came out when they talked to find out what they did in hard work
 assam main 590 ke kareeb saraswati shishu mandir hai
 There are four and a half thousand schools with a teacher
 yah skool doordaraj ke ilaakon main chalate hai
 The teacher's training union provides for these
 yah shikshak sangh kii vichaardhaara se las hote hai
 These teachers give honorarium union of five thousand from their level, by taking donations from people and institutions
 purvottar ke chaatro ke liye assam ke bheetar 100 se adhik chatravaas chalate hai
 There is no such institution in India that has so many schools in one state
 koi privet sanstha bhi sangh se is maamle main match nahin kar sakati he
 In Assam alone, there are about twelve hundred and fifty branches of the Sangh at this time
 sangh kii ek or sanstha yahaan kaaphi kaam karti he jiskaa naam he seva bharti
 It was found in the conversation that seven thousand health workers of Seva Bharati work
 inhen swasthya rakshak kaha jaataa he
 The union gives them training in homeopathy and natural medicine which also becomes the means of their employment
 sangh 14 saal se har saal aath dinon kii ghanavantari seva yatra nikaalata he
 About 200 MBBS doctors are brought from all over the country
 inaki team aath-aath dinon tak alag-alag ilaake main camp lagaati he
 And a truck medicine is distributed among the poor by asking people
 sangh kaaryakarta ne bataaya ki ham logon ko apni vichaardhaara or seva se prabhavit karte hai
 Whoever wants to vote never says, but if someone in politics turns upside down, then it is our job to keep an eye on him
 tamaam sansthaaon se jude pandrah bees hajaar kaaryakarta chunaavon ke samay apni jimmedaari khud samaj jate hai
 Especially when their organization is abused, then they will never vote on the side that causes abuse
 isi baatcheet main ek dilachasp baat yah pataa chali ki is baar assam ke satradhikaar kaaphi naaraaz the
 As there is a monastery, so is the session in Assam
 mathadhish ko vahaan satradhikaar kehete hai
 Resentment has increased due to the occupation of Bangladeshi Muslims on the land of Sessions of Assam
 satradhikaron ne bhi sangh ko target kiye jane se naaraazgi jataai he
 Two hundred and fifty officers had talked about change
 in satron main bhakthi, nrity, sangeet kaa shikshan, prashikshan chalata he
 Do those who challenge the Sangh or talk about a Sangh-mukt Bharat, have the conviction of the Sangh's structure and the commitment of the workers
 aisa nahin he ki sangh kaa yah aadhaar hameshaa bijepi ko jeet hi dilaa detaa he lekin agar sangh se ladanaa he to ladane waalon kii taiyaari kya he
 This time 250 magistrates, ie religious monks, started talking about change
 in mathon se jude bhakton kii shrinkhalaa ne congress ke aadhaar ko bheetar hi bheetar kamjor kar diya
 Now it has to be seen whether the Congress ever used the politics of soft Hindutva through these authorities
 hamane jab yah sawaal poocha ki yah itane hi taqatvar hai to pehle kyon nahin bijepi ke paksh main badlaav kara sake
 In response to this, it was told that the Congress government's tolerance towards Bangladeshi Muslims was disenchanted and it angered the target of the Sangh
 bangladeshi musalamaanon kaa mudda bijepi rashtriya str par uthaati rahi lekin isse assam main vah jagah nahin bana saki
 Meanwhile, Badruddin became Ajmal's party and continued to win seats
 is baar ajmal khud chunaav haar gaye hai, unhen congress ke ummidavaar waajid ali choudhary ne 16,723 maton se haraa diya he
 If the Congress had similarly challenged Ajmal from the front, he would not have been accused of nurturing Muslim communalism
 jaankaar kehete hai ki ajmal ne muslim sampradayikta ko badhaava diya jisaki pratikriya main congress naram hindutv kii taraf jane ko majaboor hui
 But the same Ajmal was also supporting the UPA in 2009 from outside
 congress agar hindutv aadhaarit sampradayikta ke prati gambhir hoti to muslim sampradayita se bhi sangharsh karti
 However, Ajmal says that his party is not just a party of Muslims
 duusare dharmon ke logon ko bhi tikat detii he
 Now the Sangh says that the BJP government will have to identify and send out Bangladeshi Muslims
 kya vaaki bijepi itane bade str par musalamaanon kii pahchaan karegi or nikaalane kaa kaam karegi
 If the Sangh believes, its government will have to be tested on this basis
 bijepi ne 9 muslim ummidavaar utaare the, do hi jeet sake
 Jammu and Kashmir has the most Muslims, there is a BJP government
 uske baad assam main hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The comments assam main bhartiya janata party ne muslim vot ke myth ko bhi dhwast kar diya he
 During the Lok Sabha elections it was said that there are so many Muslim majority seats in UP
 iske baad bhi bijepi ne 70 se adhik loksabhaa siten upi main jeet leen
 Separate fighting of opposing parties in UP benefited as it did in Assam
 assam main bhi congress or eudief milakar ladate to donon kaa mat pratishat bijepi se adhik hota
 The Congress neither openly challenged or shook Ajmal
 assam main muslim maton kii takat kaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki ek baar jamiyat ulema hind ke moulana asad madani ne apni 18 maangen puri na hone par congress kii sarkaar hi gira dene kii baat kah di thi
 Neither Ajmal nor Madani has influence in the government that is being formed in Assam today
 muslim vot kii chunavi takat ko bijepi ne apni ranneeti se kamjor kar diya
 Assam's victory is big for BJP
 bijepi mukhyalay main assam kii parampara main pradhanmantri kaa swaagat ho rahaa he
 When Narendra Modi came to the BJP office as Prime Minister, he took the name of Devdas Apte
 yah vahi apte hai jo nagpur se 1963 main jansangh ke prachaarak banakar assam gaye the
 When Prime Minister came to Delhi during his political training, Apteji was the incharge of BJP headquarters
 naanaa ji deshmukh apte ji ko avadh tirhut mail se assam le gaye
 Apte ji is now 80 years old but went to Assam at the age of 24 years
 apte ji se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki lanbaa vakt lag gaya assam ko bangladeshi musalamaanon kaa masalaa samajhane main
 Apte ji formed the Anti Infiltration Committee in 1964
 tab assam kii rajdhani shilong hua karti thi
 They brought the census report from the library there
 praja socialist party ke vidhayak madhusudan das ko is masale se jod diya
 Apte ji is happy with this victory
 sangh jeet ke is drishy main shaamil nahin he par kya yah jeet uski nahin he
 It is the happiness of his loved ones
 congress ne bihar se nahin siikhaa or gathbandhan nahin kiya
 The BJP has said that it learned from Bihar and formed an alliance

 After all, what did the RSS do? assam main kaam kar chuke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke ek varisht sadsy se hamane baat kii
 It is not enough to tell just that the Sangh worked very hard, many things came out when they talked to find out what they did in hard work
 assam main 590 ke kareeb saraswati shishu mandir hai
 There are four and a half thousand schools with a teacher

 These teachers give honorarium union of five thousand from their level, by taking donations from people and institutions
 purvottar ke chaatro ke liye assam ke bheetar 100 se adhik chatravaas chalate hai
 There is no such institution in India that has so many schools in one state

 In Assam alone, there are about twelve hundred and fifty branches of the Sangh at this time

 Resentment has increased due to the occupation of Bangladeshi Muslims on the land of Sessions of Assam

 Two hundred and fifty officers had talked about change

 Do those who challenge the Sangh or talk about a Sangh-mukt Bharat, have the conviction of the Sangh's structure and the commitment of the workers
 aisa nahin he ki sangh kaa yah aadhaar hameshaa bijepi ko jeet hi dilaa detaa he lekin agar sangh se ladanaa he to ladane waalon kii taiyaari kya he
 This time 250 magistrates, ie religious monks, started talking about change
 in mathon se jude bhakton kii shrinkhalaa ne congress ke aadhaar ko bheetar hi bheetar kamjor kar diya
 Now it has to be seen whether the Congress ever used the politics of soft Hindutva through these authorities
 hamane jab yah sawaal poocha ki yah itane hi taqatvar hai to pehle kyon nahin bijepi ke paksh main badlaav kara sake
 In response to this, it was told that the Congress government's tolerance towards Bangladeshi Muslims was disenchanted and it angered the target of the Sangh

 Meanwhile, Badruddin became Ajmal's party and continued to win seats
 is baar ajmal khud chunaav haar gaye hai, unhen congress ke ummidavaar waajid ali choudhary ne 16,723 maton se haraa diya he
 If the Congress had similarly challenged Ajmal from the front, he would not have been accused of nurturing Muslim communalism
 jaankaar kehete hai ki ajmal ne muslim sampradayikta ko badhaava diya jisaki pratikriya main congress naram hindutv kii taraf jane ko majaboor hui
 But the same Ajmal was also supporting the UPA in 2009 from outside
 congress agar hindutv aadhaarit sampradayikta ke prati gambhir hoti to muslim sampradayita se bhi sangharsh karti
 However, Ajmal says that his party is not just a party of Muslims
 duusare dharmon ke logon ko bhi tikat detii he
 Now the Sangh says that the BJP government will have to identify and send out Bangladeshi Muslims
 kya vaaki bijepi itane bade str par musalamaanon kii pahchaan karegi or nikaalane kaa kaam karegi
 If the Sangh believes, its government will have to be tested on this basis
 bijepi ne 9 muslim ummidavaar utaare the, do hi jeet sake
 Jammu and Kashmir has the most Muslims, there is a BJP government
 uske baad assam main hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The comments assam main bhartiya janata party ne muslim vot ke myth ko bhi dhwast kar diya he
 During the Lok Sabha elections it was said that there are so many Muslim majority seats in UP
 iske baad bhi bijepi ne 70 se adhik loksabhaa siten upi main jeet leen
 Separate fighting of opposing parties in UP benefited as it did in Assam
 assam main bhi congress or eudief milakar ladate to donon kaa mat pratishat bijepi se adhik hota
 The Congress neither openly challenged or shook Ajmal
 assam main muslim maton kii takat kaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki ek baar jamiyat ulema hind ke moulana asad madani ne apni 18 maangen puri na hone par congress kii sarkaar hi gira dene kii baat kah di thi
 Neither Ajmal nor Madani has influence in the government that is being formed in Assam today
 muslim vot kii chunavi takat ko bijepi ne apni ranneeti se kamjor kar diya
 Assam's victory is big for BJP
