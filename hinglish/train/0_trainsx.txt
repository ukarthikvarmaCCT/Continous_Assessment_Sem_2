 India's continued stand on Dawood Ibrahim's presence in Pakistan got the support of the United Nations when the world body explicitly confirmed the six addresses of the underworld don in this neighboring country of India
 dogier main nau paton kaa ullekhasanyukt raashtra kii iesael or alqaida pratibandh samiti kii suchi mendudke kai passports ke bare main soochna shaamil he
 These passports also carry passports issued in Pakistan
 bharat ne apni ore se saunpe gaye dogier main nau paton kaa ullekh kiya he jo 1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaakon kemastermindadaud se sambandhit hai
 The United Nations removed three addresses
 The ISIL and the Allegations Committee of the United Nations Security Council amended its Dawood-related list on Monday

 The six other addresses provided by India have not been revised
 bharat ne ek dogier main in nau paton kaa ullekh karte hue kaha tha ki daaud in sthanon par aksar aata he
 When asked about this amendment to passports issued from Pakistan, a top Indian official said that one of Dawood's addresses in the listed information was incorrect

 The information about his various passports is also listed in the committee's list

 unhone kaha ki kaig ko samvidhan kii dhara 149, 150 or 151 ke tahat audit ke adhikaar hai
 According to Joshi, CAG has three types of audit rights including financial audit, compliance and performance audit
 keval vittiya audit to sie bhi kar saktaa he
 He said that on 13 June 2006, even in a government order, the CAG was said to have such rights even when the UPA government was in power
 joshi ne kaha ki sarkaar ke saare mantralay kaig ke parformens audit se ghabaraate hai kyonki isse unka kaccha chittha khul jayega isliye sarkaar or congress party kaig par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 He said that the CAG, PAC and the press work for accountability and transparency in the country but the government is attacking all such organizations which expose corruption
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar chaahati nahin he ki bhrashtachar ke maamle janata ke saamne aaen isliye anna hajaare, baba ramdev jaise logon kii aawaaj bhi dabaane kii koshish kii jaati he
 Joshi said that the government wants to end democracy and it is moving towards dictatorship
 unhone kaha ki congress party or sarkaar ko spasht karnaa chahie ki kya vah in sanvaidhanik sansthaaon par party sadasyon ke is tarah ke gambhir bayanon se sahamat hai or yadi nahin to un par kya karrwai kii jaaegi
 He said that suppressing those who raise their voice against corruption is a very dangerous sign and if the government runs like this then whatever indignation will thrive in the country will be responsible
 joshi ne america main badhate aarthik sankat kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki aaj hamane sansad main is mudde ko uthaaya or anya vipakshi dalon kaa bhi maananaa he ki sarkaar ko sanbhal janaa chahie or aarthik nitiyon kii buniyaad kii samiksha kii jaani chahie
 He also reiterated the demand to have the issue discussed in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki haalanki mangal kii vartmaan sataha main jivan nahin punap saktaa he
 But perhaps the atmosphere of Mars was able to keep water or fluid present on the planet's ground

 On Monday, something similar was seen in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly when SP MLA Kalpnath Paswan started crying bitterly in the Assembly
 unhone haath jodakar vahaan maujuud spikar se apane liye nyaay maanga
 The budget session of the UP Vidhan Sabha is going on and the leaders of all the parties had come to participate in the proceedings of the House 
 tabhi azamgarh ke mehnagar se vidhayak kalpanaath paswan apni seat se khadey hokar jor-jor se chillane lage
 In fact, his complaint was with the Uttar Pradesh Police, which is not registering his FIR
 kuch din pehle unki car se das lakh rupee chori ho gaye the, lekin police ne ab tak is maamle main koi FIR darj nahin kii he
 The MLA repeated the same complaint in front of the House and while making this statement, he started crying bitterly in the House
 unhone kaha ki 'mere saath nyaay kiijie
 If i don't get justice, i will definitely die
 aaj main ro rahaa hum sadan main, kal puraa sadan roega
 'get the money, otherwise i will die
 
 
 spikar ko sambodhit karte hue paswan ne kaha, 'manyavar nyaay kariye
 i am pleading with the whole House with folded hands
 main kahaan jaaun
 i am telling the whole House, i will not live
 manyavar main garib kisaan hum
 Get my money, otherwise i will die
 ' unhone yah kehete hue apane donon haath jod liye
 Seeing this situation of the MLA, the MLA sitting with him in the House encouraged him and appealed to Paswan to sit down
 saath hi spikar ne bhi unke prati sadan kii ore se apni samvednaa jaahir kii
 It is being told that MLA Kalpnath Paswan took out this money from the bank to build his house
 lekin beeti 7 janvari ko azamgarh choron ne noton se bharaa unke suutakes se saare paise gaayab kar die
 After this, the MLA wanted to lodge his complaint with the police, but the police has not written any complaint in this matter so far

 avaidh bangladeshiyon ke saath hi pradesh bhar main rah rahe rohingya musalamaanon ko bhi satyaapan karavaaya jayega
 Information will also be gathered about whether illegal foreigners are making their whereabouts under the guise of legitimate people

 Now a massive campaign will be launched to identify Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims
 darasal, is puri kavayad main mushkilen ye bhi hai ki avaidh bangladeshiyon kii pahchaan karne ke baad unhen jail bhejnaa hota he or baad main unhen deport karne kii kaarywahi kii jaati he, lekin bangladesh apane nagarikon ko waapas lene se manaa kar detaa he or aise main mushkil pradesh ko hoti he
 Now to start it afresh, the captains of all the districts have been instructed by the DGP headquarters to survey and identify illegal Bangladeshis on a large scale
 unke paas jo bhi unki pahchaan se jude dastavej hai unki padtaal kii jaae, jisase saaf ho sake ki kis tarah avaidh bangladeshi yahaan par rah rahe hai or unke khilaaf kis tarah kii karrwai kii ja sakati he
 According to sources, there is a possibility of more than 10 lakh illegal Bangladeshis in Uttar Pradesh
 khufia vibhaag or police prashasan pehle bhi isamen survey kara chukaa he, jisamen sabase zyada avaidh bangladeshi pashchimi uttar pradesh ke noida, gajiabad, meerut, saharanpur or bulandshahr jilon main rah rahe hai
 Illegal Bangladeshi also live in a large number in Lucknow, the capital of UP, but most of them have their local ID, including ration card, voter card and Aadhaar card
 ye log yahaan par chote-mote kaam karte hai jisamen kooda beenana, gharon kii saaf-safai or chote-mote dhandhe karnaa shaamil he
 According to intelligence sources, many of these illegal Bangladeshi have also been involved in many crimes
 farji dastavejon ke sahare rahane vaale bangladeshiyon ke bare main kai baar jaankariyaan milti rahati hai jo ki kai tareeke ke lut-khasot or aparaadhik vaardaaton main shaamil rahe hai
 According to the information, hundreds of Rohingya Muslims are also living in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki, inke bare main abhi bhi sarkaar ne koi aakhri rukh tay nahin kiya he

 It is said that at the time of this accident, the bus had more than a hundred hundred people in excess of capacity, out of which many people were traveling on the roof of the bus
 rasta phislan bharaa tha, jisaki vajah se driver kaa bas par se niyantran kho gaya, or vah gandak nahar main ja giri
 The accident occurred about 250 km south-west of Kathmandu
 tippaniyan The water flow was very fast, due to which the riders did not get much time
 bataaya gaya he ki bas main savaar 16 logon ko bachaa liya gaya he, jabaki 39 logon kii maut ho gai he
 70 people are still reported missing

 However, many other reasons are also being cited behind Priyanka Chaturvedi's leaving the Congress
 jab rafel par press conference karne kii baat hui to unhone mathura ko chunaa or mathura kii seat congress ne mahesh pathak ko de di thi jo mumbai ke bijnesaman hai
 Now the question arises, who is behind the misbehavior with Priyanka in Mathura? Priyanka wanted to contest from another seat in Mumbai, which was won by Sanjay Nirupam
 vajah ye bataai gai ki sanjay nirupam mumbai pradesh adhyaksh ke naate pichley 5 saalon se sadakon par andolan karte rahe hai
 Second, the Congress gave tickets to two women ie Priya Dutt and Urmila Matondkar in Mumbai
 teesri mahila ummidavaar ke liye ab vahaan jagah nahin ban rahi thi
 Politics experts believe that even though the incident of Mathura is behind Priyanka's immediate decision, there is a deep political thought behind it

 At the same time, the officials of the government department in their state are trying to impose restrictions on the skills of women officers
 aisa hi ek maamla bihar diwas par bhi dekhne ko mila
 In this program, the skill of Namita Bhardwaj, officer in Bihar Education Project, was appreciated by the Vice President
 haalanki namita bharadwaj ko apane isi hunar kii vajah se chaar maheene tak vetan nahin milane kii sajaa mili thi
 The reason for the punishment was that the officers of his department did not like this skill of their eyes
 mili vaahvahisafalataa keval agrim pankti main baithe logon ko hi milti he, is baat ko jhootha sabit kiya us kalakaar ne jisane pichhali pankti kii sabase pichhali seat par baithkar uparashtrapati kaa sketch banaaya
 Vice President m Vaikenya Naidu arrived in Patna on an occasion on the occasion of Bihar Day
 jitani der main unhone udghaatan bhaashan diya, utani der main ek mahila kalakaar namita bharadwaj ne unka sketch bana diya
 The woman who made this sketch at Patna's Gandhi Maidan, Namita Bhardwaj, is an officer in the Bihar Education Project
 patna ke gandhi maidan main apane bhaashan ke dauraan uparashtrapati ne kaha ki samaaj ke antim pakti main baithi mahilaon kaa bhi shashaktikaran hona chahie
 Hearing this, Namita could not stop herself and showed her sketch to the Vice President from her place
 phir uparashtrapati ne ishaare se unhen bulaayaa or sketch ko kaaphi pasand bhi kiya
 Also applauded Namita
 aapako bataa den ki namita ne apni is hunar kii koi vidhivat shiksha nahin lee he
 Namita said that the skill of a human being can write a sign of success at any turn of life

 At the same time, he was also deprived of a salary increase of only 3%
 aapako bataa den ki janvari 2017 main patna main hue guru govind singh maharaj kii 350wein prakaash parv par bhi namita ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii guru govind singh ke saath painting banaai thi
 When Namita wanted to present him, the department official stopped her
 mukhyamantri ne unke kaam kii saraahna kii, lekin painting banane ke dandswaroop vibhaag ke varisht adhikari ne 6 dinon tak 10 baje subah se shaam 6 baje tak unke cabin ke baahar khadey rahane kaa dand diya tha
 Did not pay salary for four months
 parivaar ko kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Also kept away from important departmental works
 aarope he ki yah baat kai adhikariyon ko pataa thi, lekin sab chup rahe
 At the same time, women empowerment is claimed on their behalf
 namita ke is sajaa ke peeche us dauraan piem modi or nitish kumaar ke algaav kii baat bhi kahi ja rahi he
 Now Nitish and PM Modi are united, but Namita Bhardwaj still remains a victim of departmental discrepancies
 namita kaa kahana he ki asahneeya pidaa ke is daur main mahamahim uparashtrapati se milane kii safalataa ne unhen maraham or saahas diya he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has resigned from the post after he failed in his attempts to introduce the Jan Lokpal bill in the Delhi Assembly
 unhone uparajyapal najeeb jang ko apane istife kii chitthee saunp di he
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal announced his resignation while addressing workers outside the party office at Hunman Road
 unhone kaha, 'hamaara sabase bada mudda tha ki janalokapal bill paas karana he
 The Congress had written that we will support the Jan Lokpal bill
 lekin, jab hamane paas karana chaha to bijepi or congress donon mil gaye
 That is why our government resigns
 ' (puraa bhaashan padhe) After the BJP and Congress voted against the introduction of Janlokpal Bill in the state assembly earlier, Arvind Kejriwal gave enough hints that his government might resign
 janalokapal vidheyak pesh hone ke khilaaf matdaan ke baad vidhansabha main apane sankshipt bhaashan main mukhyamantri ne kaha tha, 'yah hamaara antim satr lagata he
 If i have to sacrifice the Chief Minister's post 1,000 times and kill my life to end corruption, i will consider myself lucky
 ' Kejriwal held his cabinet meeting at the state secretariat after the assembly session was adjourned sine die
 is baithak ke baad vah party daftar ke liye ravaanaa hue or vahaan party samarthakon evam kaaryakartaaon ke bich apni sarkaar ke istife kaa elaan kar diya
 Earlier, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal presented the Jan Lokpal bill amidst huge uproar in the Delhi Assembly, but after this the BJP and Congress did not allow it to be discussed and demanded that it should not be considered
 is mudde par antat: spikar ko voting karaani padi or 70-sadasyeey vidhansabha main bhaajapa tathaa congress samet 42 vidhayakon ne bill ke virodh main vot kiya or sarkaar kaa prastaav gir gaya
 27 mlas supported the introduction of the Jan Lokpal Bill
 ab yah bill pesh hua nahin mana jayega
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal got up and said that he was presenting the bill amidst the uproar due to the opposition's demand to vote on the advice of the Lieutenant Governor given to the Assembly not to introduce the bill without adopting the constitutional process
 sadan main vipakshi dal bhaajapa or sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahi congress ke dabaav ke baad spikar ne uparajyapal kii vah chitthee padhakar sadan ko sunai, jisamen is bill ko pesh na karne kii salaah di gai thi
 After this, the opposition continued to demand voting on the letter of the Lieutenant Governor, while the Delhi government was repeatedly urging to discuss this issue
 haalanki baad main spikar ne mukhyamantri se bill pesh karne ko kaha or is par charchaa karaane kii anumati de di
 The opposition objected strongly to this and accused the speaker of bias
 congress ke ek vidhayak ne spikar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane kii baat bhi kahi he
 Seeing the commotion, the house had to be postponed again
 isse purv, sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi vipaksh ne yah bhi maang kii thi ki pehle kanoon mantri somnath bharti ke mudde par charchaa kii jaae
 In view of the uproar, the speaker adjourned the proceedings of the house for 20 minutes and called an all-party meeting
 dilli pradesh congress adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali ne sadan main kaha ki ham bill kaa samarthan karne ko taiyaar hai, yadi vah samvidhan ke anuroop laayaa jaae
 He said that Kejriwal should leave his hair
 vahiin vipaksh ke netaa harshavardhan ne kaha ki kejariwal desh main jhooth na failaaen
 We never opposed Janlokpal
 iskaa samarthan karne or ise lagu karne main bhartiya janata party sabase aage rahi he
 Actually, the Central and Delhi governments are face to face regarding the Jan Lokpal bill
 kendriya vidhi or nyaay mantralay ne bhi saaf kar diya he ki grih mantralay kii manjuuri ke bagaiyr is bill ko vidhansabha main pesh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Congress, which is supporting the Aam Aadmi Party and the main opposition party BJP, says that they will not tolerate the violation of constitutional provisions
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki 'aap' sarkaar maujuuda satr kaa vistaar 16 farvari se aage karne ko taiyaar he or vidheyak kaa paarit hona sunishchit karegi, lekin iske paarit nahin hone kii sthiti main unke paas istipha dene ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin hoga
 Kejriwal said on Thursday, "we are ready to extend the session
" ham yahaan sarkaar bachaane ke liye nahin hai
 He said, We are committed to Janlokpal Bill and Swaraj Bill and i am ready to sacrifice the post of Chief Minister 100 times to remove corruption from India
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kanoon mantri somnath bharti ke istife ke mudde par sadan kaa kaamkaaj nahin chalane dene ke liye bhaajapa or congress ne haath mila liya he
 Kejriwal said that he did not think that in any assembly in the history of India, it would have happened that the BJP and Congress had united
 inhone khud ko benakaab kar diya he

 This is an army film, so we want to make it completely relevant
 film kii taiyaariyon ke bare main baat karte hue raghavan ne kaha ki ve chaahate hai ki film sahi tarah se bane
 Before making the film, information has also been obtained from Arun's family
 bataa den ki varun dhawan or shriram raghavan isse pehle saal 2015 main ai film badlapur main saath kaam kiya tha
 a Bollywood film based on the true incident came out 'special 26'
 jisamen dikhaaya gaya tha ki kis tarah se 26 logon ne farji iskar adhikari banakar desh main kai thagi kii vaardaaton ko anjaam diya tha
 One such incident has come to light in Uttarakhand's capital Dehradun
 jahaan special 8 kii ek team ne shahar ke ek bade kaarobaari ko lakhon rupaye kaa chuunaa laga diya
 This incident is in the posh area race course road of Dehradun
 jahaan shahar cabade vyapaaree yashpal tandon kaa gharhai
 Eight people rushed to Yashpal's residence in a luxury car on Monday evening
 inamen do mahilaayein bhi shaamil thi
 These people called themselves income tax officers
 is team kaa netritv ek tej tarraar mahila kar rahi thi
 This team of Special 8 had gathered a lot of information about the businessman
 unhone ghar main aate hi yashpal ke ghar ko khangaalana shuru kar diya
 Asked for information about their books, bank accounts, cash and jewelery
 ye aath log kai ghante vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 They searched the corner of the house
 iske baad unhone yashpal ko saamne unki kai kamiyaan gina di
 After this, Infergy officials spoke to the businessman for settlement and took Rs 21 lakh
 saath hi ghar kii mahilaon ke keemtee gahane bhi apane kabje main le liye
 After a while, these people left from there with many weighing gold jewelery and a luxury car
 kai ghante biit jane ke baad yashpal tandon ne is bare main chaanbin kii to pataa chalaa ki unke saath thagi ho hui he
 He immediately informed the police about this
 sari baat jaanane ke baad police ko bhi lag rahaa he ki thagi karne waalon ko iskar vibhaag ke bare main kaaphi jaankaree thi
 The police have registered a case and started searching for the thugs
 esaspi sadanand daate ne is ghatana ke khulaase ke liye police kii kai tiimon ko kaam par lagaaya he
 The police are searching for the thugs from the businessman and his family
 ankhon par kaala chashma, tan par kurta-jacket, gale main gamchaa or ungaliyon kii bhashaa main kisi ko chetavanee dete hue manoj vaajapeyi kii ye tasviir unki aane vaali film 'tevar' kii he
 The interesting thing in this picture is that these men are standing in awe wearing a panties on the platform of a political party
 prakaash jha kii film 'raajnneeti' main apane abhinay se aalochakon ko 'karaara jawaab' dene ke baad manoj vaajapeyi ek baar phir khalanaayak se tewaron vaale netaa ke rup main najar aaenge

 a meeting between BJP President Amit Shah and JDU chief Nitish Kumar is proposed on July 12
 donon netaaon ke mulaakaat se chaar din pehle dilli main jediu kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii do divasiy baithak 7-8 july ko hone ja rahi he
 It is believed that the party's future strategy will be decided in this meeting of the National Executive of JDU
 bihar ko vishesh darja dene ke mudde ke saath is baithak main loksabhaa siton ke bantwaare ke mudde par bhi charchaa ho sakati he
 The meeting before the Lok Sabha elections is considered very important
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main shaamil hone ke liye party adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar 7 july ko pahunche
 After this, on July 8, he will participate in the national executive meeting
 is baithak main party padaadhikariyon, rajyon ke adhyakshon ke saath hi kaaryakarini ke kareeb 100 netaa shaamil honge
 Further strategy is also likely to be considered in the meeting to demand special status for Bihar
 haal ke dinon main jediu apni is puraani maang ko lekar ek baar phir mukhar hua he
 Interestingly, on July 12, Amit Shah will meet Nitish Kumar in Patna
 aise main jediu kii ye baithak sirf 4 din pehle hone ke siyaasi myne nikaale jane lage hai
 The people of Delhi are relieved

 According to the police administration, the situation is now under control

 Even before this, there have been communal riots five to six times

 For this reason, both communities got a chance to meet face to face during the procession

 Girls should learn good things rather than wrong things
 unhone kaha- maine fatwa jari kar kaha he ki sangeet samaaj ke liye acha nahin he

 i am not afraid but now i am not interested in music and bands

 petm pement getwe logon ko railway tikat book karne ke samay dikhegaa nahin kyonki yah bacand main kaam karata he
 However, according to reports, Paytm will now offer many offers on booking tickets from IRCTC
 petm ne kaha he ki ab petm ap or website par iarsitisi ke jariye railway tikat kii booking hogi
 Apart from this, Paytm users can now get information about PNR number and train from Paytm itself
 agar aap petm kii website yaa ap se railway tikat book karenge phir bhi ise puraa karne ke liye aapako iarsitisi kii website par rediarect kiya jayega jahaan aapako iarsitisi kaa yujaranem or password darj karnaa hoga
 Along with the train ticket booking, the company-commerce website is also set to become the country's largest travel booking platform
 kyonki isse pehle bhi petm ne air tikat or bas tikat booking kii shuruyaat kar di he

 After England captain Alastair Cook lost to Lords by 95 runs in the second cricket Test, critics may be demanding his removal, but Cook said that despite a 95-run defeat against India in the second Test, he was still Not willing to give up captaincy
 bharat ne ‘cricket ke makka’ lords par 28 saal baad test match apane naam kar itihaas rachaa
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led team took a 1-0 lead in the five-test series with a 95-run win
 bharat ne lords ke maidan par 28 varshon main kisi test match main pehali jeet darj kii he
 With this, Kapil Dev's team achieved this feat by winning by five wickets in June 1986
 cook ne match khatm hone ke baad kaha, yah kadi haar he
 i think we have to give a lot of credit to India, they battered us both in batting and bowling
 lords kii ghaas vaali pich par england ko toss jeetne ke baavjood shikast jhelni padi
 He said about the pitch, even in the last innings, the pitch was taking turn and bouncing, it was good to win the toss here, but India should give credit for it, they showed excellent game
 england ke senior khilaadi apane record ke anusaar pradarshan nahin kar rahe hai, jabaki yuvaaon ne acha khel dikhaaya he
 Cook described it as an issue of players' confidence
 unhone kaha, nishchit rup se yah aatmavishvaas kii baat he
 Our team is a group of players who are eager to win for England
 hamaare yuva khilaadiyon ne kaaphi badhiya pradarshan kiya, jo english cricket ke liye acha he
 Yes, the senior players are not playing according to their records, including me
 mujhe bhi ran bananaa hoga
 Cook praised Matt Prior, saying he has immense talent
 is samay mujhe lagata he ki vah desh kaa sarvshereshth wicketiper ballebaaj khilaadi he
 He said about the challenge of making a place in the team, every player has to get his place in the team and Prior is a 'fighter'
 aap apane dressing room main aisa khilaadi rakhana chaahoge
 In the end, Cook became a bit emotional and looked sad as he could not perform with the bat
 unhone kaha, main is parinaam ko badalane ke liye sab kuch kar rahaa tha
 But for this i have to start scoring runs first
 pichley kuch samay se balle se main pradarshan nahin kar paa rahaa hum, lekin captain ke taur par maine kuch match jite hai
 On Tuesday, 44 people belonging to other banned organizations in the country including the brother of jaish-e-mohammed chief Masood Azhar were taken into custody in Pakistan
 pakistan ke grih mantralay ne yah karrwai 4 march ko neshnal acshan plan par hui ucch stareey baithak main hue faisle ke aadhaar par kii he
 But if we look at the old developments, Pakistan has been taking such action before to show the world under global pressure
 pakistan ke aantarik maamalon ke rajya mantri shehryaar afridi ne bataaya ki 4 march ko rashtriya suraksha samiti kii baithak main neshnal acshan plan par ucch stareey baithak hui jisamen sabhi praanton kii sarkaron ke pratinidhiyon ne hissaa liya
 In this meeting, it was decided to expedite action against banned organizations
 jiske tahat moulana masood ajahar kaa bhai hamaad ajahar or saalaa mufti rauf asagar samet pratibandhit sanghathanon ke 44 sadasyon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he
 In fact, the government of Pakistan is under pressure to present details of the action taken against terror at the next review meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an organization that monitors terrorist funding worldwide
 isse pehle somvaar ko pakistan ke videsh mantralay ne 26 / 11 mumbai hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ke sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa or falaah-e-insaaniyat foundation samet anya pratibandhit sanghathanon kii sampattiyaan sij karne kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 However, this is not the first time that Pakistan has taken such action under global pressure
 isse pehle 2001 main sansad par hamale ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne jaish-e-mohammad par bain lagaaya tha
 Despite this, the Jaish chief was openly involved in anti-india activities in Pakistan
 yahi nahin mumbai hamale ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne jamaat-ud-daawa or lashkar-e-taiyaba ke thikaanon ko sil kiya tha lekin ve maheene bhar ke bheetar hi dobaaraa khul gaye
 While Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed has been under house arrest three times since the 26 / 11 attacks
 phir bhi hafiz said kaa bharat ke khilaaf jang kaa elaan karnaa or jehad ke liye logon ko bhadakaana kam nahin hua
 Not only this, after the January 2016 attack on Punjab's Pathankot airbase, Pakistan had arrested Masood Azhar, his brother and other terrorists
 lekin baad main unhen chhod diya gaya
 Explain that the responsibility of the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, was taken by jaish-e-mohammad, the organization of Masood Azhar
 mufti rauf asagar vahi shaks he jisane 5 farvari ko karachi main raily kar bharat par fidaayin hamalaa karne kii dhamkee di thi
 The dossiers related to Jaish that India has handed over to the Government of Pakistan after the Pulwama attack mention the Jem rallies held in different parts of Pakistan on 5 February

 It was written that whatever happiness, acid burned all in luck, i hide my face as if a crime has been committed
 meri samaj main nahin he aata na jane kaisaa ye maajaraa he,dari hui hum main aaine se yaa aaine ko daraa diya he
 There is no darkness in our world, we do not have it, we have burnt the lamp of the lamp
 he hukum maula sabar karne ke sabar kaa fal ajij hoga,lihaaja tuba ne khwahishon ko thapak-thapak kar sula diya he
 You could not win even by winning

 Of course reading this awakens the light of hope in the darkness of hope, one such light is Tuba Tabassum

 koun he tuba tabassum:ye naam aaj isliye khaas he kyonki unhen mitaane ke liye manchalon ne unpar tejaab feka
 Of course, his face melted as the acid fell, but not his spirits
 un par yah hamalaa 26 sitambar 2012 main hua tha
 She was going from her home to read tuition in the morning, when the boy studying with her threw acid on her due to resentment
 tabassumki galati itani thi ki wo us ladke se baat nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 Even if the perpetrators of this crime are in jail, they have to bear this accident for life
 mushkilon ke baat bhi pai kamyabitabassum ne india today kii baatcheet main apane jivan ke tamaam anubhav saajha kiye
 On his success, he said that i had all the problems while studying, yet i have achieved 70 percent number

 Talking about her struggle was not easy, she says, 'there was no coaching and tuition facility in my village
 isliye main apane papa ke saath apane gaanv se bahut dur padhane jaati thi
 During this time i had to cover my face
 zyada der padhai karnaa chaahun to nahin kar sakati thi kyonki ankhon se aansu nikal aate the
 Referring to the acid attack on the world that changed after the acid attack, Tabbassum says that even before i was hardworking, my dream was to become a doctor
 aisa mumkin ho paanaa aaj pehle se kahin zyada mushkil ho gaya he
 But even today i am strong, i have decided that i will become a doctor
 mujhe sarkaar se ummid he ki wo meri madad kare
 The family and teachers increased my passion, the family supported them in difficult circumstances
 is bare main wo bataati hai ki ghar ke logon or shikshakon kii ore se puri madad mili
 Message to those who are suffering from acid attack, he said that first of all it is necessary to prevent acid attack
 ye sirf bura nahin he bahut dardanaak hota he
 i will tell those who have lived like me that those girls should not lose their courage
 sarkaar se guzarishacid par bain lage or aisa bura kaam karne waalon ko kadi sajaa mili
 When asked about the future of the future, she says that i want to see myself at the stage of success
 isamen sarkaar meri madad kare

 It was 1999
 us samay main katak main padhai kar rahaa tha
 Lived in a hostel
 28 oktober ko main gaanv aayaa tha
 Lakshmi Puja was going on in the village and all the children were going to play together in the village for Lakshmi Puja
 mujhe bhi ek role mila tha
 In the evening, all the children of the village were rehearsing for the theater
 cyclone ke bare main thodaa bahut pataa tha lekin kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki iskaa asar kya hoga
 Rehearsal for the drama was going on in the village school, then slowly rain and wind started blowing
 dhire-dhire barish or hawa kii raftaar badhati chali gai
 The rehearsal closed and all the children went home
 sab kaa laga tha dhire-dhire hawa kam ho jaaegi to agle din reharsal shuru hogi
 All the children we had had no idea about the super cyclone
 super cyclone kya hota he wo bhi pataa nahin tha kyonki aise cyclone ke saath ham logon kaa kabhi takaraav nahin hua tha
 In the morning, Cyclone's speed increased and then took a terrible form
 us samay gaanv main meraa pakkaa ghar tha lekin mujhe yaad he hawa kii raftaar itani tej thi ki ghar ke mukhya darvaaze ko mere parivaar ke kai log pakadakar rakhe the
 It seemed as if the wind would lift the door
 hawa kii gati 300 kilometre prati ghanta se bhi zyada thi
 i do not remember how many hours of wind orgy went on, but it rained continuously for three days
 dhire-dhire jab hawa kii raftaar kam hui to log ghar se baahar nikalne lage, tab tak sab kuch khatm ho chukaa tha
 i did not have a village, there was no tree anywhere
 gaanv kaa bhugol puri tarah badal chukaa tha
 All those who had raw houses in the village were broken
 chat ke upar se sab kuch alag lag rahaa tha
 There was water everywhere
 log apane gaanv ko pahchaan nahin paa rahe the
 It seemed like we have come to some other place
 meraa gaanv jagatsinghpur zile main he jis zile main us samay sabase zyada kshati hui thi
 The landfall took place between Ershma and Balikud around Paradip
 paradeep se meraa ghar kareeb 40 kilometre duuri par he
 The orgy of this cyclone killed many thousands of people
 sabase zyada log jagatsinghpur zile se mare the
 Several thousand people died from Ershma and Balikuda
 mere gaanv or aasapaas ke gaanv khush-naseeb the, is cyclone se kisi kii jaan nahin gai thi
 There were too many areas around Paradip Port, all of them had suffered much
 samudr kaa pani kareeb 7 se 9 meter kii oonchai tak lagbhag 20 kilometre tak zamin par aa gaya tha
 People did not know about it
 logon ke ghar ke andar pani ghus gaya tha
 Very few people had a two-storey building
 logon ko laga ki kuch saamaan na le paaen to paisa lekar bhaag jaaen lekin hawa or pani ke saamne yah log kamazor pad gaye the
 When people found dead bodies, they had money in their hands
 sthiti itani kharaab thi ki har kahin ded body padi hui thi
 According to official figures, ten thousand people died but more than 50,000 people died
 cyclone ke baad kii kahani or bhayaavah thi
 The routes were all broken
 har taraf ukhde hue ped pade the
 At that time people did not have much mobile phones
 aise bhi kisi kaa bhi phone nahin lag rahaa tha
 The phone line, electricity were completely stalled
 kisi ke saath koi baatcheet nahin ho paa rahi thi
 People living outside Odisha were worried about their families but could not find out if they had a family or not
 jo log baahar the or apane parivaar se milane aaye the to kai kilometre tak chalane ke baad apane gaanv pahunch paae the
 Some people were able to meet their families in them, while for some people everything was over
 sadak ke raste raahat pahunchane main kai din lag gaye
 It took time to clear the way
 mujhe yaad he helicopter se upar se raahat saamagree giraayi ja rahi thi
 Whenever the helicopter was seen flying in the air, people would come out of the house and chase the helicopter
 kai baar helicopter saamaan giraata tha to kai baar bina giraae chalaa jaataa tha
 Once, a luggage dropped from a helicopter also came near me
 jab maine ise uthaaya to meri ankhon main aansu the
 i myself was broken after seeing the condition of the people of my village
 mujhe jo relif packet mila tha us me chuda or gud tha
 People in my village and surroundings were quite intelligent
 jo bhi riliff kaa saamaan miltaa tha sab ek jagah ikattha karte the, phir yah sab ko baanta jaataa tha
 It was not that one would run away with the goods of one Relief
 kuch ghanton ke super cyclone ne sab kuch badal diya tha
 Light and phone connections took several days

 What is shown in the released footage is an attempt to confuse the audience, creating an atmosphere of excitement and protest

 This multi-faceted form of Shivji is photographed with tourists and earns its livelihood

 The film raises a question that when there will be no Shiva and Shiva in Banaras and the country, will India live? The story of the displacement of Lord Shiva from our homes and lives and the struggle to preserve it is' Mohalla Assi 'is a propaganda to save the culture,' Mohalla Assi ', which some people are falsely propagating
' 'ki Soul is getting kidnapped' (ekdalog from the film) Will anyone come forward? If Sanskrit and culture are left, the country will survive! This is the story of 'mohalla Assi'

 But, despite being a national party, the Congress is contesting less seats than the regional players like Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (jharkhand Assembly Election 2019)
 paswan ne news agency ieenes ko kaha, "congress (congress) hameshaa se gathbandhan dharm ke paalan karne main vishwaas karti ha
 Wherever we feel we are strong, we contest elections there
 ham (jhamumo, congress or rashtriya janata dal) ek hi vichaardhaara kii partiyaan hai
 "he adds," If they think we are afraid of the BJP then it is their misunderstanding
 jharkhand kii janata ne pichley paanch saalon main unhen dekh liya he
 Actually, the BJP is afraid of losing and hence this election is being conducted in five phases
 ek baar unhone kaha tha ki ve rajya se naksalwad ukhaad phenkege, agar ve yah daawa karte hai ki naksalwad ko khatm kar diya gaya he, to chunaav paanch charnon main kyon ho rahe hai?"udhar, ansaari sidhe bhaajapa par hamalaa bolte hai, "bhaajapa ne soobe main aam logon, adivaasiyon or yuvaaon ko thaga he

 or janata main ek sattavirohi lahar he jiskaa phayda mahagathbandhan ko milegaa
 "ansari says," There is a difference of ground between the bjp's words and actions
 inhone sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa naaraa diya tha lekin pichley paanch saal main sirf netaaon kaa vikaas hua
 "what would happen if the Grand Alliance came to power? Paswan says," The roadmap of the Grand Alliance will be to take Jharkhand to the top of the country
 "ansaari vaada karte hai, "choubees ghante bijli, kisaanon kii karjamaafee, bijli daron or holding tex main kii gai badhotaree waapas lee jaaegi
 We will stop the migration of youth and create employment opportunities
 alpsankhyakon, daliton or adivaasiyon sabakaa vikaas hoga
 Not only development, everyone will also be respected
 "ansaari saath main jodate hai, "agar congress party satta main ai to swasthya or shiksha ke kshetra main aapako bade badlaav dekhne ko milegaa
 All the schemes of the BJP government which have caused loss to the people, will be closed
 ham nae sire se janakalyaan kaari yojanaayen laaenge
 "according to Paswan," after the Congress comes to power, every resident of Jharkhand will benefit and be made happy

 And if you are worried about how to instill excitement in your heart, what to say and what to listen, then on this day shock the words with a little head

 Do not open your lips on this day, whatever you speak, just touch the lips

 Yes, keep in mind that whenever you start this series of dialogues, the time is right

 Your action will fill them with excitement

 Keep increasing the feeling of being as close as possible
 unke sharir ke komal angon ko chhuen
 But while doing this, do not keep the bed in mind
 bas pyaar or aaj ke din ko rakhen dhyaan main
 When you touch them, do not forget to keep an eye on them

 Now you don't need to do much more, just put your lips softly on their lips

 The congress-jds government led by HD Kumaraswamy fell to the floor test due to minority
 congress-jedies ke paksh main 99 or bijepi ke paksh main 105 vot pade
 Thus the 14-month-old coalition government was forced out of power
 echdi kumaraswami ke saath jo hua, vaisaa hi kabhi unki vajah se congress or bijepi sarkaron ke saath hua tha
 In 2004, the Congress government fell in the 2004 Karnataka Assembly elections, out of a total of 224 seats, BJP got 79, Congress 65, JDS 58 and others 23 seats
 yani 2004 main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila tha
 In this way, an agreement was reached between the Congress and the JDS and Dharam Singh of the Congress became the Chief Minister of Karnataka on 28 May 2004
 yah sarkaar bahut zyada dinon tak nahin chal saki or paune do saal ke baad kumaraswami ne apane vidhayakon ke saath samarthan waapas le liya or dharamsingh kii sarkaar ko gira diya
 At the same time, a similar political tussle was seen as it happened in Bengaluru in the last two weeks
 bijepi ke saath dagadharamsingh kii sarkaar girane baad kumaraswami ne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kiya
 Due to this, the governor invited the JDS to form the government
 kumaraswami 2006 main bijepi ke samarthan se mukhyamantri bane
 During this time, before forming the government between the BJP-JDS, it was agreed that the leaders of both parties would become the Chief Minister in turn and for equal time
 kumaraswami ne apana kaarykaal puraa kar liya or jab bijepi ko satta saunpane kaa vakt aayaa to unhone aisa karne se inkaar kar diya
 Not only this, Kumaraswamy resigned as Chief Minister on November 10, after which the Governor had to impose President's rule in Karnataka
 2007 main giraayi bijepi sarkaarkumaraswami ke istipha ke baad do din tak raashtrapati shashan laga rahaa or phir bijepi ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 On 12 November 2007, a BJP government was formed under the leadership of BS Yeddyurappa, which Kumaraswamy supported from outside
 haalanki, saat din ke baad hi kumaraswami ne bijepi sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya, jiske chalate yediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad ganvaana padaa
 The politics of Katakarnataka took the turn that Kumaraswamy reaped what he had sown
 2018 main karnataka ke vidhansabha chunaav main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila
 The governor invited BJP to form the government as the largest party and Yeddyurappa took the oath of chief minister, but could not prove majority in the assembly
 iske baad kumaraswami ke netritv main jedies-congress ne milakar sarkaar bana lee
 But after a 14-month tenure, 13 Congress mlas and 3 JDS mlas revolted and resigned as mlas, after which Kumaraswamy could not prove his majority in the assembly
 yani unhen bhi waisi hi raajnneetik paristhiti kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jaise kabhi dharamsingh or yediurppa ko karnaa padaa tha
 In this way, both Congress and BJP became equal

 The politics of lies, hatred and division 'is a befitting reply to the public

 Senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said, 'most of the seats where the by-elections were held were with the BJP

 They get such a reputation that they become the stars of the state government with that respect
 is kavayat se prerit hokar kai afasar aisa farmaan jari kar rahe hai, jo surkhiyon main he
 The latest case is in Dhamtari district of Chhattisgarh, where the District Panchayat CEO Jagdish Sonkar has issued a decree that if a child is found in schools toileting elsewhere instead of toilets, his picture should be clicked and put immediately in the whatsapp group 
 unhone apane aadesh main yah bhi kaha ki skool ketoiletke upyog or nirikshan ke dauraan bheetar kii tasviren saajha kii jaae
 For this, a whatsapp group named Mission @ 355 has been formed
 is group main prashasnic afasaron, shikshakon, princepal or nagar palika va nigamon ke afasaron ko joda gaya he
 It contains orders to post toilet pictures of children daily
 iske liye unhone shikshakon se bhi kaha he ki skulon main banaae gaetoiletmen taakazank karen
 If a child urinates in the wall instead of urin paints, his picture should also be sent
 siio ke is farmaan se shikshak khafa hai
 According to him, taking a picture of any boy or girl urinating is not only objectionable, but also a crime
 iske pehle bhi swachhata abhiyaan ko lekar rajya main kai tarah kii apriy ghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 Four months ago in Bilaspur, those people who were found to be defecating in the open were put in a cage to catch animals
 iske alaava ambikapur main nigam karmiyon ne kuch logon kii pitayee bhi kii thi
 Now the CEO of Dhamtari District Panchayat Jagdish Sonkar has issued a new order by issuing this order
 vah 2014 batch ke iees adhikari hai
 Earlier, Jagdish Sonkar, who was the SDM of Balrampur district, not only interacted with the patients by setting foot on the bed of the patient in the hospital, but photographed it and put it on social media
 philhal unka yah nayaa farmaan surkhiyon main he
 This year, Dhamtari District Panchayat built toilets in 355 schools
 unke is aadesh ko waapas lene ke liye abhibhavakon or paalkon ne prashasan par dabaav daalaa he
 He has put the accountability of misuse of photographs on the administration
 iske baad mantralay main is aadesh ko nirast karne kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 It is believed that CEO Dhamtari's order will be canceled with the intervention of the Chief Secretary

 'it is worth mentioning that recently, Premji has issued a letter to the leaders of the country, along with many well-known personalities in the industry, trade, law and administration, about the decline in governance in the country
 yah apil jari karne waalon main premaji ke saath mahindra and mahindra ke chairman keshub mahindra, echdiefasi ke chairman deepak paarekh, bhartiya rigerv bank ke purv governor em narsimhan, bimal jalaan, nyaayamurti shrikrishna bhi hai
 These celebrities have emphasized to make concrete arrangements to deal with the rampant corruption of the issue of disintegration of governance in the country

 He accused the Rajasthan government, saying, "the Rajasthan government has not been able to provide farmers with MSP rates of crops like tur, gram, groundnut and mustard
" '' He said that irrigation schemes are not being implemented in Rajasthan and millions of farmers are not getting electricity connections
 centre sarkaar kisaanon kii maang or mushkilon ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he
 Along with this, he added that today 56 percent of the workers in the agriculture sector get employment
 jidipi main krishi kaa yogadan 14 pratishat he lekin bajet aavanton ek pratishat se bhi kam he
 Therefore, farmers in the country are getting upset
 unhone kaha ki rajasthan main sinchai kii yojanaayen lagu nahin ho rahi or lakhon kisaanon ko bijli conection nahin mil rahe hai
 The central government is ignoring the demands and difficulties of the farmers
 iske saath hi unhone joda ki aaj krishi sector main 56 pratishat mazdooron ko rojgaar miltaa he
 Agriculture contributes 14 percent to GDP but budget allocation is less than one percent

 isse bharat ko landan olympic main padak jeetne kii ummiido ko karaara jhatka laga he kyonki ashvini us riley team kaa hissaa rahi hai, jisane asian khelon main swarna hasil kiya tha
 All athletes found guilty of consuming banned drugs have declared themselves innocent
 sabakaa kahana he ki unhone sidhe taur par kabhi bhi steroid kaa seven nahin kiya

 At the same time Sports Authority of India (sai) has also started investigating the case at its level

 The gun did not fire when the opportunity came
 haalanki wo bhi sarkari bandooken hai
 But now a series of encounters took place
 faqat 11 maheene aurasaade baarah sau encounter
 That means more than a hundred encounters every month
 he naa kamaal? ek taraf upi kii sarkari bandooken chalati hi nahin thi, or ab achaanak vahi bandooken danaadan goliyaan ugal rahi hai
 Why not grow? When the finger on the trigger is given by Yogi and the government orders the encounter, the bullets will fire
 apradhi kaa khaatmaa!sawaal ye he ki achaanak upi main accounter kii jhadi kyon lag gai? kya whupi main kaanoon vyavastha is kadar charmara gai he ki encounter ke alaava koi rasta hi nahin bachaa? kya upi main criminal is kadar belgaum ho chuke hai ki achaanak puure sosayadi ke liye khatra ban gaye? kya upi kii police in 11 maheenon main is kadar bebas ho gai ki krime par control hi nahin kar paa rahi he? yaa phir sarkaar ne sabase aasaan rasta chun liya he ki krime khatm karnaa he, to criminal ko hi khatm kar do
 Is the encounter the only solution? But is this path right? Is the encounter the only way and the last weapon to improve up's law and order? If yes, then as long as this encounter continues, why not lock all the courts of UP for the time being? Anyway, justice is being done on the street now instead of courts, that too with bullets
 upi main 455 farji encounterrashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog kii ek report ke mutabik ek janvari 2005 se lekar 31 oktober 2017 tak yani pichley 12 saalon main desh bhar main 1241farji encounterke maamle saamne aae
 Of these, 455 cases were against the UP Police
 maanavadhikaar ayog ke mutabik inhen 12 saalon main upi police kii hiraasat main 492 logon kii bhi maut hui
 Let us show you the picture of fake encounters in the last 12 years across the country in the eyes of statistics

 It is written in Saamana that President's rule in Maharashtra will not be valid at all, it should be withdrawn immediately
 kuch log hai jo maharashtra ke saath khelnaa chaahate hai, ham bataanaa chaahate hai ki maharashtra ke saath mat khelo khatm ho jaaoge
 Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has also been questioned in the confrontation
 saamana main likhaa gaya he ki maharashtra ek alag rajya he, yahaan kuch tedha-medhaa nahin chalegaa
 What are the four parties doing? Even after the imposition of President's rule, there is a stir to form a government

 Motherhood is the first priority for Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and she has no intention of returning to the silver screen right now
 pichley saal november main aishwarya ne pehali beti aradhya ko janm diya tha
 Aishwarya, who came to attend the 25th anniversary of Keith Vaz, a British MP of Indian origin, said, "the feeling of being a mother is very pleasant, i am enjoying it
" ’ pichhali raat ko edward hithro hotel main raatri bhoj ke dauraan 38 varshiya is purv vishwa sundari or unke abhinayta pati abhishek bachchan ko dekha gaya tha
 Asked about Aishwarya's sharing of motherhood responsibilities, Abhishek said, 'I am guilty, because neither i am not able to give a lot of time to change my daughter's nappy

 Aishwarya was last seen in the film 'guzaarish' on the big screen

 petrol or dijalki keemton kaa aasmaan par pahunchane kaa daur ek baar phir shuru ho gaya he
 One liter petrol 80 in Mumbai on Tuesday
 79 rupee kaa mil rahaa he
 At the same time, 72 people for one liter in Delhi too
 92 rupee chukaane pad rahe hai
 However, despite this rally in prices, there is little hope of getting relief on this front in the budget
 antarrashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemten 3 saal ke top par pahunch gai hai
 This has a direct impact on the prices of petrol and diesel in the country
 badhati keemton ko dekhte hue tel mantralay ne bajet main exise duty ko kam karne kii maang kii he
 He argues that this will provide relief to the common man from the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 haalanki bajet menexise dutiotane kii ghoshnaa sarkaar karegi, ye thodaa mushkil najar aata he
 The central government has already cut excise duty in view of rising prices and people's anger
 oktober main usne petrol or dijal par 2 rupee kii exise duty gata di thi
 But now he has little chance to reduce his duty
 rajkoshiya ghaataa badhane kaa khataraab aisa kadam uthaane kaa matlab hoga ki sarkaar apanaarajakoshiya ghatbadhane kaa khatra paidaa karegi
 Reduce the fiscal deficit by reducing excise duty 3
 2 fisadi rakhane kaa lakshya sarkaar ke liye hasil karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 This will create new challenges on the economy front
 tel companiyon se bhi raahat kii ummid kamadusari taraf,tel companiyonse bhi is morche par raahat milane kii ummid kam hi he
 Crude oil prices are increasing internationally
 isaki vajah se companiyon kaa kharch bhi lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, it is impossible to get relief from these companies on the prices of petrol and diesel
 aise main aam aadmi kachche tel kii keemton main giravat aane kaa intjaar karne ke alaava kuch nahin kar saktaa
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is running bets one by one
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle apane siyaasi sameekaran ko behatar karne ke liye ab unhone mastrer stroke chalaa he
 The Kejriwal government has given good news to about 40 lakh people of Delhi

 The Modi government has prominently put this issue on its 100-day agenda
 isse pehle 1961 main sabase pehali baar aisi policy banaai gai thi or 101 coloniyon ko niyamit kiya gaya tha
 Even then, the practice of regularizing the colonies was done at least three times
 dilli ke shahari vikaas mantri satyendra kumaar jain ne kaha ki hamen khushi he ki jo sapana in coloniyon ke logon ne dekha tha wo ab puraa hone vaala he
 The Delhi government has spent Rs 3000 crore for these colonies
 iske alaava abhi or 3000 karod rupye kharch karegi
 Satyendra Jain said that soon the people living in these colony will get ownership of their land
 chaahe vah nijee jameen par rahete hon yaa sarkari jameen par
 From 1994 to 2014, the court kept saying - first of all facilities, then regularize that the Delhi government had sent a proposal to regularize unauthorized colonies to the Central Government on November 2, 2015 for approval
 haalanki 1994 se 2014 ke bich supreme court or dilli hoicourt ne in coloniyon se sambandhit kai maamalon main spasht faisle die ki inhen tab tak niyamit nahin kiya ja saktaa, jab tak inamen moolbhoot suvidhaayen pradaan na kar di jaaen
 Delhi government started providing facilities Keeping these important decisions and instructions in mind, Delhi government has started providing basic facilities in these colonies
 moolbhoot suvidhaon main siver, pine ke pani kii pipe line, sadaken, naaliyon or galiyon kaa nirmaan chal rahaa he
 The Chief Minister of Delhi also personally inspected the ongoing development works in unauthorized colonies several times
 dilli sarkaar ke mutabik zyaadaatar anadhikrut coloniyon main moolbhoot suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane kaa kaam aane vaale paanch maheenon main puraa ho jayega

 samaajawaadee party ke purv adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne phir ek aisa bayaan diya he jo unke bete or sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke liye jhatka sabit ho saktaa he
 Mulayam has attacked the SP-BSP alliance in UP and has objected that Akhilesh Yadav agreed to half the seats in this alliance
 mulaayam kuch din pehle bhi loksabhaa main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii jeet or satta main vaapasi kii kaamana kar chuke hai
 Mulayam said how Akhilesh Yadav agreed to such an alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party in which the Samajwadi Party has got half the seats
 mulaayam ne to ye tak kaha ki party ke log hi party ko khatm karne main jute hai
 Women are not getting preference in the party
 hamane itani badi party banaai, lekin party ko ab kamjor kiya ja rahaa he
 Mulayam said that out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, only 25-26 seats can be won
 mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha, 'maine akhilesh se kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke liye pratyaashiyon ke naam kaa elaan kar do jisase ko taiyaari kar saken
 BJP has surpassed us in terms of preparations
 hamane 14 maheene pehle ummidavaaron ke naam final kar diya tha or badi jeet mili thi
 But Akhilesh could not decide the ticket yet
 ' unhone kaha ki ki jeetne vaale netaaon ko tikat do
 People are giving names to Shivpal too
 tikat dene bhale hi akhilesh ke haath main to hataanaa mere haath main he
 Significantly, the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have formed an alliance in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha elections to be held a few months later
 is gathbandhan ke tahat akhilesh yadav or mayawati kul 80 siton main se 38-38 siton par chunaav ladane par sahamat hue hai
 Mulayam, the leader of the state's politics, does not like these two ardent opponents of UP politics coming together
 ye pehali baar he jab mulaayam singh yadav ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan par apni chuppi todi he
 Mulayam has reservations about how his son Akhilesh Yadav gave up his claim to more than half the seats before the elections
 upi se is samay sapa ke saat saansad hai jabaki bahujan samaaj party kaa ek bhi saansad nahin he
 Mulayam has raised the voice of his younger brother and Akhilesh's rival Shivpal Yadav by questioning the SP-BSP alliance, who has blown the bugle against the SP by forming a separate party
 bataa den ki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi jab akhilesh yadav ne congress ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha tab bhi mulaayam singh ne sawaal etraj jaahir kiya tha
 Not only this, he did not go to campaign on any other seat except the seat of Shivpal Yadav and Parasnath Yadav
 vaise ye pehla mauka nahin he jab mulaayam ne akhilesh yadav ko apane bayaan se asahaj kiya he
 Earlier, on the last day of the 16th Lok Sabha, Mulayam while blessing Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the House said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked closely with everyone, and has tried to take everyone along
 pradhanmantri modi ko hamaari badhai or hamaari kaamana he ki vah phir se chunakar aaen or pradhanmantri bane
 BJP has taken this statement of Mulayam and is also using it to attack Akhilesh continuously
 aise main mulaayam kaa nayaa bayaan akhilesh yadav kii mushkilen or badha saktaa he
 India's limited-overs captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the most popular in the sponsorship world despite retiring from Test matches but a contracting brand 'spartan Sports' has cheated him for over Rs 20 crore
 vishwast sutron se pataa chalaa he ki australia ke sparton sports se 13 karod rupee se zyada kaa praayojan qaraar or teen saal kaa balle kaa qaraar khatai main pad gaya he
 This company regularly fails to pay
 dhoni ke balle ke qaraar kii railty ko mila liya jaae to yah raashi 20 karod rupee se upar kii he
 The source of the law firm, which is advising Dhoni's management company, Riti Sports, told PTI that Kunal Sharma's Spartan company has paid only four installments since the agreement, which was done in December 2013
 iskaa taaja bhugtan march 2016 main kiya gaya tha
 The comments riti sports ke maalik arun pandey se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ‘‘sabakuch thik nahin he or ummid he ki yah maamla jald hi sulajh jayega
 "attempts were made to talk to Kunal Sharma through phone and messages, but he did not respond
" (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Trusted sources have revealed that a sponsorship deal worth more than Rs 13 crore from Australia's Spartan Sports and a three-year bat contract have fallen into disarray
 yah company niyamit rup se bhugtan main asafal rahi he
 If the royalty of Dhoni's bat agreement is included, then this amount is above Rs 20 crore
 kanoonee form, jo dhoni kii prabandhan company riti sports ko salaah de rahi he, ke sutara ne pitiai se kaha ki kunal sharma kii sparton company ne qaraar ke baad se ab tak keval chaar kishton kaa hi bhugtan kiya he jo disambar 2013 main hui thi

 ) Kejriwal is once again on target of the opposition after the allegations of gang rape on Aam Aadmi Party leaders in Rohini area
 aam aadmi party ke do netaaon par namazad exiaar hone ke baad bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ne rohinee ilaake main aam aadmi party ke khilaaf jamkar narebaaji kii or pradarshan kiya
 The protesting activists of the BJP have demanded the immediate arrest of the accused leaders and also brought the role of other party leaders in the entire case under scrutiny
 gangrape kii exiaar darj hote hi siyasat bhi garm ho gai he, kyonki peedit mahila ne aarope lagaaya he ki emsidi chunaav main tikat dilaane ke naam par uske saath balaatkaar kiya gaya, saath hi lagaataar uskaa shaareerik shoshan bhi aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne kiya
 Only after this statement, BJP has intensified the attack on Kejriwal
 aap par barase dilli bijepi adhyakshadilli bijepi ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ke liye ab aise aarope naye nahin he, balki aam aadmi party main aise netaaon kii bharmaar he, jo mahilaon kaa shoshan kar rahe hai or satta kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 Upadhyay alleged that first Kejriwal government minister Sandeep Kumar sexually abused a woman by luring him to get a ration card, then made a pornographic video of her and had to go to jail
 iske pehle apni hi kaaryakarta ko shaareerik shoshan ke baad aatmahatya ke liye majaboor karne ke liye inke ek emele bhi jail ja chuke hai
 Upadhyay alleged that the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party are misusing the power of Delhi for the exploitation of women, while Arvind Kejriwal made many promises for the safety and well-being of women to vote before the elections
 lekin satta par kabiz hone ke baad ab iske ulat hi kaam kar rahe hai
 Includes father of Vidhan Sabha Deputy Speaker: BJP: Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay said that it is also being said that the name of the leader of Aam Aadmi Party and father of Vidhan Sabha Deputy Speaker is also included in this gang rape, which is not only surprising, Rather, it also shows the culture of the Aam Aadmi Party, although he said that it will be investigated by the police whether his father is involved in this crime or not
 The same is embarrassing itself and Arvind Kejriwal should respond to the issue that why it takes such accusations leaders of his party

 It is worth noting that there is a plethora of money transfer apps in the world market including America
 yani aipal mujeec kii tarah is bazaar main company der se entry legi
 At present, the company has not officially said anything about digital money transfer
 isliye abhi yah bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki yah bhartiya yugers ke liye aayega yaa sirf america ke liye hi launch kiya jayega

 On the night of May 2, a fire broke out in a 2,500 square meter store located in Mahalgaon of the Government Electricity Company, Central Region Power Distribution Company, in Gwalior
 aag bhi aisi bhayankar jise bujhane ke liye damakal kii 350 gadipoon ko puure 24 ghante lage
 And suspicious because the same store caught fire on the night of May 18, 2009, five years ago
 tab 30 karod ru
 25 crore was lost due to loss of electrical appliances including more than 250 transformers in store
 se zyada kaa nuksaan hua he
 One particular similarity between the two arson incidents is that immediately before the fire, the chief general manager of the power company (CGM) ordered physical verification of the entire contents of the store
 sijim virendra gupta bhi is baat ko sweekaarte hai
 "the scrap was auctioned from this store in April," he says
 isamen dhaandhlee hui thi
 Considerably enough transformers were dumped into junk
 is maamle main keshavrao ghorpade naam ke ek babu ko nilambit kiya gaya he
 After this, the entire stock was to be checked, and the work was to begin on Monday 5 May, but the store caught fire three days before that
 '' 2009 main jab store main aag lagi thi, tab bhi store ke saamaan kaa bhautik satyaapan hona tha
 Arson was also investigated but nothing came out
 is baar bhi nateeja nikalne kii ummid kam hi he kyonki aag ke kaaran store kaa sara saamaan jal chukaa he
 In such a situation, the stock will not be matched
 is maamle main kisi adhikari kii jimmedaari tay karnaa bhi mushkil hoga kyonki store ke mahaprabandhak es

 Sumer Singh, the junior engineer who took responsibility for the store, has been suspended by the power company
 jaahir he, kuch log hai jo nahin chaahate the ki store ke record ko jaancha jaae
 Probably, this is why the CCTV cameras of the store were also closed for the last 25 days, no one bothered to fix them
 aag lagane kii vajah jaanane ke liye company ne teen sadasyeey cameti banaai he jisamen sijim virendra gupta, nideshak (vaanijya) e

 The script of a major change is ready in the electricity department of Uttar Pradesh
 bijli vibhaag ab kisaanon or mahilaon ko swaavlambee banane kii disha main abhootpurv yojana shuru karne ja rahaa he
 On the plans related to the future and the power department, Cabinet Minister Shrikant Sharma of the Department of Energy discussed in detail the 'india Today' at his government residence in Lucknow on the evening of 18 December
 -dhai varshon ke dauraan aap upi ke bijli vibhaag ko kahaan khadaa pate hai?pradesh kii bijli vyavastha main hamane bahut bada badlaav kiya he
 When our government came, only 16,500 MW was the peak demand
 yah ab batchqar 21,500 megawatt ho gai he, ise bhi ham puraa kar paa rahe hai
 Has given connections to one crore 14 million people
 centre sarkaar se 'power for ol' samjhauta kiya he
 If there is a shortage of power, then it meets the central government
 hamane aise rajyon se samjhauta kiya he jahaan garmiyon main bijli kii maang kam hoti he, inase ham garmi main upi ke liye bijli lete hai
 We should provide better energy to the people of the state and the government is working on all its options
 -aap saura urja vibhaag ke bhi mantri hai, upi main saura urja kaa kya bhavishya he?saura deshon ke samooh kaa bharat pratinidhitiv kar rahaa he
 Its international office has been established in Gurugram
 sanyukt raashtra main jo satat vikaas ko bindu tay hue hai unamem ek he ‘sasti or svachh bijli’
 Prime Minister's focus is that we also double the income of farmers and provide cheap, clean electricity to them
 abhi tak kisaan keval apni kheti par aalu, subjiyan yaa phir dhan, gehun yaa phir chanaa ugaata tha ab kisaan urja kaa utpaadan bhi karegaa
 For this, the Prime Minister has launched 'kusum Yojana'
 isamen praavdhaan he ki jo banjar bhoomi he kisaan kii vahaan par vah apana saura urja kaa sanyatra laga saktaa he
 If the farmer himself is not competent, he can lease his land
 aisi jameen jo oosar he, upjau nahin he
 This will make the farmer a power producer and he will also be able to sell this power to the Power Corporation
 kisaan ko yah bhi sahuuliyat he ki saadhe saat harse power se lekin ek harse power tak kaa tubewel bhi solar par sthapit kar saktaa he
 In this, both the central and state governments are giving grants
 isse kisaanon ko bijli ke taron se khet main hone vaale vyavdhaan se bhi mukti milegi
 Apart from this, the farmer can run tubewells already installed in the field with solar energy
 bijli kii jitani aavashyaktaa he utana upyog kar saktaa he, jitani bijli bachegi use transmishan ke madhyam se discom ko bech bhi saktaa he
 This will not only provide clean energy to the farmer but will also help in increasing his income
 upi main hamane 2022 tak 20 hajaar tubewel lagane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 We have also targeted to produce 10,700 MW of solar power by the year 2022
 isi ke anusaar sarkaar aage bad rahi he
 There are plans to nurture buildings and buildings of all government departments with solar energy
 isaki shuruyaat lakhanu main bijli vibhaag ke daftar shakti bhawan main solar ruf top lagaakar kar rahe hai
 - Power consumers have to run a lot for small tasks? For this we are constantly smarting the electricity department
 smart meter, smart preeped meter, jhatpat yojana ke jariye online bijli conection, on line bijli bill jamaa kar sakate hai, online lod badwa sakate hai
 Smart meters are being installed in cities and prepaid meters in villages
 hamaara lakshya 40 lakh meter lagavane kaa he
 Till now we have installed seven lakh smart meters in the entire state
 -bijli vibhaag par ghaataa bhi kaaphi he
 How will the facilities be increased by this? Today the electricity department owes Rs 13 thousand crore
 isse discom kaa reating ghatati he or upabhokta kaa nuksaan hota he
 i have started installing prepaid meters from my home
 preeped meter lagane kaa phayda yah he ki bijli vibhaag ko jo paisa chah maheene baad miltaa tha vah chah maheene pehle hi mil ja rahaa he
 The companies from which the electricity department buys power have to pay in advance
 preeped meter lagane se bijli vibhaag kaa ghaataa ham kam kar paaenge
 Consumers will benefit from this
 aane vaale samay main sabhi sarkari bhawanon main smart kam preeped meter lag jaaenge
 At present, smart cum prepaid meters above 25 kw are not available as soon as all government buildings will be covered by them
 -bijli chori or linelos abhi bhi vibhaag ke liye chunauti he?ham har tarah kaa linelos kam karne kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 Government power stations have been established in 65 districts
 ‘single disit’ main linelos laane kaa lakshya he
 Special campaigns are going on for this
 jahaan sabase zyada linelos he vahaan smart meter, abi conductor laga rahe hai
 Billing and want to improve 'collection efficiency'
 jab bijli vibhaag smart banegaa to alag-alag tarah ke los kam honge
 Consumers will benefit from this
 -bijli bill vasuuli bhi main bhi gadabadiyaan saamne ai hai?aane vaale samay main bijli ke bill kaa collection mahilaon ke haathon main hoga
 The village will get 24 hours of electricity in the coming days
 har gaanv kaa feader alag kar rahe hai
 In this, the help of women self-help groups will be taken so that the recovery of electricity bill is also 100 percent
 iske liye shuruyaat main mathura, banaras, gorakhpur or agra main yojana lagu kii jaaegi
 Women will be paid at the rate of Rs 20 per bill
 is yojana se mahilaon ko rojgaar ke avasar paidaa honge
 - Power houses in Uttar Pradesh have become very old? Many power plants are very old
 varsh 2030 tak hamaari planning he
 The government has enough electricity by the year 2030
 kai nae plant lagane kii yojana chal rahi he
 Many are also upgrading the plant
 uttar pradesh utpaadan nigam ke power plant kii bijli pehle bahut mahangi dedh rupye prati unit pad rahi thi, hamane ise gata kar 99 paise prati unit kiya he
 We have paid special attention to the maintenance of the power plant
 -bagal ke rajya dilli main bijli upbhonntaaon ko kaaphi sahuliyatein mil rahi he, kya upi main aisa laabh nahin mil saktaa?upi main dhai sarkaar kii sarkaar kii tulana aap dilli main pichley 25 saal se bijli ke kshetra main chal rahe sudhaar se aap nahin kar sakate
 Electricity is in private hands in Delhi, so that their line-up is very low
 upi main kai aise feader hai jo 55 pratishat se zyada linelos main rahete hai
 Two and a half years ago, where there was more than 32 percent lineloss in UP, we have brought it to 24 percent
 jald hi ham ek ank main linelos ko laane vaale hai
 Efforts are on to make up's electricity department economically self-reliant
 jis gati se upi ke bijli vibhaag main sudhaar chal rahe hai usase dilli jaise rajyon ko kaaphi peeche chhod denge
 The PF scam has brought the electricity department into disrepute
 pravident fund se judaa jo trust hota he usase sarkaar kaa koi sarokaar nahin hota he
 Earlier governments changed the rules in an illegal manner
 jo paisa sarkari bainkon main nivesh hona tha use nijee bainkon main nivesh kiya
 Action was taken as soon as these irregularities came to the notice of our government
 bijli karmchaariyon kaa pai-pai waapas kiya jayega
 - There have been complaints of corruption in the electricity department? We are attacking corruption
 isi kaa parinaam he ki bijli vibhaag main sabhi sanvida karmiyon ko samay par vetan mil rahaa he
 a portal has been established for these
 aaj kareeb 50 hajaar sanvida karmiyon ko portal ke madhyam se unka haq dilaa rahe hai
 We have broken the nexus between officers and contractors
 visilence ke madhyam se saadhe teraa sau tenderon main gadabadi kii jaanch bhi kara rahe hai
 Chargesheet has been done on 125 employees
 urja vibhaag main bhrashtachar karegaa vah bachegaa nahin
 *** kai baar garmi ke dinon main aapane bhi aisa sochaa hoga ki kaash koi aisa AC jaisi divaais hoti, jise har vakt apane saath rakhaa ja saktaa
 Now preparations are being made to turn this dream-like thing into reality
 south china morning post dwaara post kiye gaye video ke mutabik, soni ne ek 'viereble' air-condishnar ko develop kar liya he or is divaais ke liye croudfnding project ko launch kiya he
 The wearable AC mentioned above releases the warm and cool air through a small panel
 is pocket sies AC kaa naam Reon Pocket rakhaa gaya he
 It is claimed that it is smaller than a mobile phone in size
 haalanki is divaais ko keval ek 'special andershart' ke saath hi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 This undershirt will also be sold along with the device
 khaas baat ye he ki is AC ke temprechar ko smartphone ke jariye control bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The even better thing is that such technology has been given in this AC that it automatically sets the correct temperature
 jari video main bataaya gaya he ki is AC ke liye jis technology ko adopt kiya gaya he wo Peltier element par besd he
 This technology is used in cars and wine coolers
 ye bydaree oparated divaais to ghante kii charging ke baad 90 minuton tak chalaai ja sakati he
 According to the information received, this crowdfunding project cost $ 200,000 (approximately 1 in just two days)
 38 karod rupee) mil chuke hai
 Surprisingly, the price of this wearable AC has also not been kept very high
 ye graahakon ko keval $130 (lagbhag 9,200 rupee) main uplabdh hoga
 However, one problem is that it will be sold only in Japan, as stated in the video
 china ke soshal media main ye project viral ho gaya he
