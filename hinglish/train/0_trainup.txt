 'saubhaahgya' yani sahaj bijli har ghar yojana ke tahat garibon ko muft bijli conection dene kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 At the same time, it has been announced to provide a connection of Rs 500 to the family members who are not included in the socio-economic and caste census and this amount will be recovered from the person in 10 installments
 iske alaava solar power pack, jisamen paanch elidi lite ke alaava ek disi pankhaa bhi rahegaa, vah bhi diya jayega
 Under 'har Ghar Bijli' in Bihar, not only BPL families, but also APL families do not have to pay any fee at the time of connection, but the prescribed connection fee is charged in installments along with the electricity bill

 lekin vah paise ke madhyam se nahin balki har upabhokta ke bijli bill main ye ankit hota he ki aakhir us maheene unke bill main kitni sabsidi sarkaar kii taraf se di gai

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has called a meeting of party leaders and mps to clarify the party's stance on an alliance with the BJP
 baithak somvaar ko mumbai main unke nivas 'matoshri' main hogi
 The meeting is significant amid rumors of a split with the BJP
 shivasena ke kuch saansadon ne bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan nahin hone ko lekar uddhav thakare ke saath apni chintaa vyakt kii he
 mps from western Maharashtra and Marathwada, in particular, fear that the Shiv Sena and the BJP will separately contest for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections if both parties lose
 vahiin, somvaar ko bijepi kii rajya kor cameti kii baithak maharashtra ke jalaana main hogi
 In this meeting too, an important decision can be taken regarding alliance with Shiv Sena
 andarkhaane main shivasena se baatcheet jari: bijepiphilhal, shivasena or bijepi ke bich gathbandhan kii vaarta is samay ruki hui he
 In the past, the Shiv Sena and Uddhav Thackeray have intensified the BJP and Prime Minister attacks, in such a situation that there is a possibility that the alliance between the two parties has remained just formal
 haalanki bijepi netaa yah kehete rahe hai ki shivasena ke saath andarkhaane baatcheet jari he or party kii ichha he ki vah loksabhaa chunaav shivasena ke saath lade
 The BJP sources are ready to share the chief minister's post and the BJP also said that if the Shiv Sena stays with it in the upcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the BJP is also agreeing to share the chief minister's post
 vahiin, shivasena ke bharosemand sutron ke mutabik, party ko dar he ki bijepi loksabhaa chunaav ke liye shivasena kaa upyog kar sakati he or vidhansabha chunaav ke samay gathbandhan se alag ho sakati he
 Shiv Sena's Ram Mandir Plan After Failure of BJP in Fellam Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, Shiv Sena thought that BJP in Maharashtra would have an instant alliance like it did with JDU in Bihar, but BJP leadership is not in a hurry right now
 is bich shivasena ne ram mandir kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 Thinking that the BJP would pass an ordinance to resolve the issue before the elections in a hurry, that could clear the way for the alliance, but the Prime Minister denied any idea of bringing the ordinance
 amit shah ke bayaan ke baad rukii baatcheetkuch din pehle hi maharashtra main bijepi kaaryakarta kii baithak main bolte hue bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne party kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki agar gathbandhan hota he to party apane sahyogi dalon kii jeet sunishchit karegi or agar aisa nahin hota he to party aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main apane purv sahyogiyon ko karaari shikast degi
 After this statement, the war of words between the two parties had intensified and the talk of alliance had stopped

 That is why he got great help in writing
 unhone kaha ki yahi kaaran he ki aaj tak kisi aise kisi shabd kaa upyog nahin kiya jisase party ko pareshaani ho
 He said that there is a lack of humor and humor in Indian politics today

 duniya bhar main lokapriy princes ke sikret teps kii transcript main yah baat nikalakar ai he
 The shocking revelation is made in a book, which is based on Princess Diana's battle with depression and her life with Prince Charles and his girlfriend Camilla

 People were trying to make you happy, but i didn't think i was happy
 dyna ne kaha ki vah charles ke saath pyaar main thim or unase nazren bhi nahin hataa paa rahi thim
 During the honeymoon, Diana used to come to the sinister Sapneemorton, quoting Diana, 'I thought i was the luckiest girl in the world
 vah (charles) ab mere saath rahegaa
 Was i wrong about my fantasies
 haalanki eshle jate hue maine camila ko dekha, uskaa betaa kursi par khadaa tha
 i have many horrific memories from that day
 'honeymoon ke bare main dyna ne khulaasa kiya he ki 'is dauraan unhen bure sapane aa rahe the
 Camila had dreams at night
 main puri tarah camila ko lekar aasakt thi
 i did not believe Charles and every five minutes i thought that he was calling Camila

 Bhagwat said that in favorable circumstances more care has to be taken and adequate care is to be taken
 yani zyada aatmavishvaas kii jarurat nahin
 Although the next message of the Sarsanghchalak was for those leaders, then thinking of the wave, they are flying in the air
 bhagwat ne kaha ki patang tabhi tak akaash main khulaa vicharan karti he jab neeche kisi ke haath main door rahati he or agar ye door haath se nikal jaaegi to patang sanbhal nahin paaegi
 Bhagwat bluntly said that opinions can be different, but do not let the mind fall apart
 shastrarth karnaa parampara he or muddon par bahes kar hal nikaala ja saktaa he
 But this type of environment is not visible
 jaahir he bijepi netaaon kii media ke madhyam se chal rahi tanatani se parivaar ke mukhiya aahat hai
 However, by the time he finished his speech, Bhagwat also looked a little soft
 bhagwat ne ishaaron ishaaron main kaha ki log pareshaan hai congress se
 Going where the base is seen and they are remembered regularly
 bhagwat ne kaha ki jis yatra main ham yani swanyasevak lage hai wo safal hogi
 That is, with the hope of victory, Bhagwat also gave a message to the BJP to take the time to complete the target
 ab bhagwat aae to the sangh ke mukhpatr ke locarpan ke liye lekin in sandeshon se saaf he ki bijepi kii kalah se sangh khush nahin

 Congress today said that Mother Ganga is extremely intelligent and can differentiate between good and bad
 party ne narendra modi ko yaad dilaayaa ki bharat kii teen sabase adhik pradooshit nadiyaan gujarat main bahati hai
 In fact, Modi had given a call for Ganga and also a promise to clean it
 modi ke varanasi main rodsho or namakan karne ke ek din baad unhen nishane par lete hue congress ne pavitra nagari kaashi kii janata se apil kii ki vah use ‘vichaardhaaraon ke yuddh’ main jitaaye or vibhaajankaree takaton ko nakaar den
 Congress spokesperson and Union Minister Kapil Sibal alleged that after filing nomination papers in Varanasi, Modi wrote a letter which is once again full of half truth
 unhone dilli main kaha ki yah (patr) kahata he ki ganga hamaari maa he, isliye uski safai kerani he
 He then gives the example of Sabarmati for example
 vah kehete hai ki 2001 main jab vah gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane the to sabarmati kii sthiti 2014 ke mukaable ekadam alag thi
 In fact, Sabarmati is also suffering from the same suffering as the Ganges that is suffering
 sibbal ne kaha ki maa ganga atyant budhimaan he or vah achche, bure ke bich fark kar sakati he
 Modi has also taken the name of Gautam Buddha
 kya vidambnaa he

 Questions raised on the language of the PM also created a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha and the mps questioned Prime Minister Modi's language for the opposition
 maharashtra kii siyasat main mahaasangramchcha-bhattije ke bich varchasv kii jangsharad ne 1987 main kiya tha baghawatmaharashtra kii satta ke khel main ajit pavaar apane chachaa ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke nakshe kadam par chal rahe hai
 congress-shiv sena-ncp were churning to form the government that Ajit Pawar rebelled with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP to form government
 ajit pavaar ne 41 saal puraani ghatana ko taaja kar diya he, jab sharad pavaar 1978 main congress netaa vasantdada patil ko jhatka dete hue janata party ke saath milakar siem ban gaye the or congress dekhati rah gai thi
 Shalini Patil, wife of Vasant Vada Dada Patil of the latest developments in Maharashtra, said that 'like Ko Tit' had happened to Sharad Pawar
 vasantdada patil kii patni ne kaha, 'sharad pavaar ne jis tarah kaa bartaav vasant raav ke saath kiya tha, unke saath vaisaa bartaav hona hi chahie tha, jo ajit pavaar ne bijepi ke saath jaakar kiya he
 Shalini Patil said that what Sharad Pawar reaped in 1978 was like a dagger in the back to grab power
 unhone kaha ki sharad pavaar gupt rup se baghawat karne kii bajaay vah vasant dada patil se sidhe taur par bhi apni baat kah sakate the
 Let us tell that in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections in the country, the Congress veteran and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was defeated and the Janata Party government was formed
 aise main maharashtra main bhi congress party ko kai siton se haath dhonaa padaa tha, jiske chalate rajya ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shankar raav chavaan ne haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 In such a situation, Vasantdada Patil succeeded him as CM of Maharashtra
 yahi daur tha jab congress main tut ho gai or party congress (es) or congress (ai) do dhadon main bant gai thi
 In this way, Sharad Pawar joined the Congress (S)
 saal 1978 main maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav hua or congress ke donon dhadon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 The Congress (S) had then bagged 69 seats and the Congress (I) had 65 seats
 jabaki, janata party ne 99 siton par kabja jamaaya tha
 In this way, the three parties were not in a position to form the government on their own
 aise main vasantdada patil ke netritv main congress ke hi donon dhadon ne saath aane kaa faisla liya tha
 Sharad Pawar disbanded the Congress (S) before both the factions of Congress formed the government together
 sharad pavaar ne congress (es) ke 38 vidhayakon ko lekar janata party ke sathprogressive democratic front banakarsarkaar bana lee thi
 In this way, at the age of 37, he became the youngest Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 baad main yashwanthdada patil bhi sharad pavaar kii party main shaamil ho gaye the
 This Pawar government lasted for two years
 indira gandhi ke dobaaraa satta main aane ke baad farvari 1980 main pavaar ke netritv vaali sarkaar gir gai thi
 However, Sharad Pawar later returned to the Congress
 maharashtra kii siyasat ne ek baar phir karavat lee he or 41 saal puraane itihaas ko doharaaya he
 Ajit Pawar has also disbanded the NCP led by his uncle and Guru Sharad Pawar and formed a government with BJP and became deputy CM
 aise main dekhnaa he ki ajit pavaar kitne ensipi vidhayakon ko apane saath jodakar rakh pate hai, kyonki sharad pavaar sakriy ho gaye hai party ko bachaane ke liye
 In such a situation, it has to be seen who falls in the battle of uncle and nephew

 Roar - Tigers of Sundar Banector: Abhinav Shukla, Himarsha Venkatasamy, Achint Kaur, Subrata Dutta, Nora Fatehi, Ali Kuli Mirza, Adil Chahal, Varinder Singh ghumandirector: Kamal Sadanaduration: 2 hr 3 min
 5 starbengal kii khadi ke muhane par khaare pani ke jowar bhaate ke bich panpa nayab jangal he sunderbans
 Its white tigers are famous worldwide
 inaki sundarataa ko clic karne pahunchataa he wild life photographer udai
 He finds a tiger baby trapped in a string of poachers
 udai use restahouse le aata he
 The mother comes in search of the child
 magar baccha to jangal department vaale le gaye
 Uday is left writing about his smell and the condition of wild life in his diary
 baghin ko aata he gussa
 Uday gets set
 film rivyuu: kanfusion ke kone main fansi kahani 'sonaali cabel' kii
 For the corpse, his commando brother whose code name is Pandit
 ab uski jindagi kaa ek hi makasad he
 Revenge with the tigress
 iske liye vah kanoon ko taak par rakhkar hathiyaaron kii khep, ek local guide or commando saathiyon ke saath ghusata he sunderbans main
 In this work, a local girl Jhumpa joins her as an explorer
 jangal main unhen avaidh shikariyon kaa ek dasta bhi miltaa he
 And then the hunt begins
 par koun he shikari or koun banegaa shikaar
 This is an interesting story of Roar
 Film Review: jaaniye kisi film he 'happy new year'
 Where on one side humans have intelligence, weapon and plan
 duusari taraf apane ghar main ghus aae logon ke prati hamalavar junglee jaanavar
 Seeing the film Roar is the first status message printed
 good atempt
 The location of the film ie Sundarbans creates a kind of wrinkled hypnosis with its wet greenness
 baagh kii harakatein ho yaa hamalaa yaa phir ghadiyal or saanp, sab kuch asli hai or viefex takanic se unhen asardaar dhang se jangal main project kiya gaya he
 Another feature of the film is its more or less rapid pace
 kul milakar yah ek mjedaar, romaanchak or hindi film ke lihaaj se nayaa prayog ban jaati he
 but
 
 
 film main kuch jhol bhi hai
 First, most actors cannot handle the big screen of cinema
 kuch tivi se aae hai, kuch sharir dikhaane aae hai or kuch sidhe akhaade se uthakar chale aae hai
 Amidst all this, Subrata Dutta has done a good job in the role of Pocher Beera
 manjhi hui actor achint cor ke jimme bataur jangal wardan zyada kuch karne ko aayaa nahin
 The lead pair of the film are Abhinav Shukla in the role of Pandit and Kingfisher Calendar fame model Himarsha in the role of Jhumpa
 abhinav tivi kii duniya se aae hai magar yahaan vah ausat hi rahe
 Himarsha did not have to act as much footage as he got
 commando team ke member ke taur par ali kuli mirza mjedaar lage
 Nowadays he is also giving a lot of fun in Big Boss
 nora fatehi ko himarsha ke saath jangal main mangalanuma maahaul paidaa karne ke liye rakhaa gaya
 Hence no comment about his acting
 varinder singh ghuman mistar india fame arnald mark pahalwaan hai
 So he said neither body nor body appeared fiercely
 nora or himarsha ko unhone hi ang pradarshan main kadaa muqabla diya
 Apart from acting, there is also interference in the chronic diseases of Hindi cinema somewhere in the story
 ban main bhatakate bhatakate commando ek junglee jati ke gaanv pahunch jaati he
 And then Zhinga Lala Hu Numa starts dancing
 aakhir main baagh ko bhi maa kii mamata ke bhavuk shikanje main kas dayaa kii murti dikhaa diya jaataa he
 And finally, after freeing the tiger's second child, kisses, or rab, eyes fill the forest marsh
 film darshan ke str par bhi kuch ataki bhatki he
 Once upon a time, the film Save the Tiger campaign begins to expand
 iske alaava jhumpa kaa vanadevi numa avatar ho yaa phir uske puraane sambandh kii adhuri dikhaai gai kahani
 Whether the commando's team is inclined towards Bira's intrigues or the selective agility of the forest department
 sab kuch dekhakar lagata he ki kahani par or mehnat kii jaani chahie thi
 Roar is for those who like Anaconda type wild adventures
 bharat main is tarah kii koshishen shuru ho gai hai, iske liye kabhi actor rahe diarector camel sadana badhai ke paatr hai
 This is a new type of film
 bacchon or baalkon ko khub pasand aegi
 It can also be a way to remove the sting of Happy New Year
 dahaad pasand ho to jaaen ror dekhne

 nitish mishra, narendra singh or vrushan patel ne maanjhi kaa bachaav karte hue kaha tha ki unhen pad par bane rahanaa chahie
 Remember that the relationship between former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Jitan Ram Manjhi was not as smooth as before

 However, Nitish has publicly denied these reports

 narendra singh, vrushan patel or nitish mishra ne maanjhi ko nahin hatane dene kaa daawa kiya, saath hi agle siem ke taur par bhi maanjhi ko hi project karne kii baat kahi
 Narendra Singh went one step further

 bihar ke krishi mantri narendra singh ne 'aaj tak' se kaha, 'maanjhi ko hataanaa jehar khaane jaisaa hoga
 Manjhi will not step down during this tenure as well as the next Chief Minister will decide the legislative party
 nitish ke netritv main ladane kaa matlab mukhyamantri bananaa nahin he
 At the same time, Education Minister Vrishan Patel has warned that if the Manmojhi is removed, the horse of Modi's Ashwamegh Yajna will not be able to stop in Bihar
 unki maang he ki bihar kaa aglaa siem bhi mahadalit hi ho
 According to Rural Development Minister Nitish Mishra, many mlas in the party are not in favor of merger of JDU-RJD

 According to sources, the PMO has sought a report on the incident from the army headquarters
 sena ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki maamle se sena ke sheersh adhikari sharminda hai
 Such cases are usually investigated at the internal level
 sutron ne bataaya ki yah ladaai tab shuru hui jab sena adde ke commanding officer kii patni ne kathith rup se ek leftinent karnal kii patni se durvyavhaar kiya
 The co's wife also beat up another woman
 unhone bataaya ki kaarykram main kai varisht adhikari or unki patniyaan maujuud thim
 The lieutenant colonel has complained to the PMO, Punjab Police and the National Human Rights Commission about the case
 tippaniyan Sources said the Minorities Commission is also investigating the case
 sutron ke anusaar sena karmiyon kii patniyaan sena adhinium ke daayre main nahin aati lekin is tarah ke maamalon se nipatane ke kai tareeke hai
 He said that counseling sessions are usually held to deal with such cases
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Sources said the fight started when the wife of the commanding officer of the army base allegedly abused the wife of a lieutenant colonel

 ) priyanka gandhi (priyanka Gandhi) kii sakriy raajnneeti main alag- alag netaaon ke alag-alag bayaan saamne aa rahe hai
 Some are criticizing this decision of Congress, while others are calling it a right step
 magar uttar pradesh ke baliya se bhaajapa vidhayak ne to aalochana kii seemaa hi laangh di or priyanka gandhi wadra ko ramayana kii shurpanakha bataa diya
 In fact, on Tuesday, BJP MLA Surendra Singh described Congress President Rahul Gandhi as 'ravana' and his sister Priyanka Gandhi as 'shurpanakha'
 bataa den ki congress ne priyanka gandhi ko party kaa mahasachiv banaaya he or unhen purvi upi kii kaman di he
 BJP MLA Surendra Singh from Baria said on the question of the journalist that the Congress has become a broken boat
 wo to keval essi-asti act ke kaaran rajasthan or madhya pradesh main jeet gai
 You know that when Rama and Ravana's war was about to take place, Ravana first sent his sister Shurpanakha
 ram kii bhoomika main modi hai or ravan kii bhoomika main rahul hai jinhone apni bahan shurpanakha ko utaara he
 Let us assume that Lanka has conquered
 isamen koi andeh nahin he ki modi phir se bharat ke pradhanmantri banenge
 Siyasat ki zubaan aisi bhi hai

 Let me tell you that Surendra Singh has been involved in controversies in the past too
 isse pehle bihar main bijepi ke mantri ne bhi priyanka gandhi par vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 He had said that votes cannot be won on the basis of beautiful faces
 bihar ke mantri vinod narayan jha ne priyanka gandhi wadra ko congress mahasachiv banaae jane par kaha, "khubasurat chehron ke dam par vot nahin jite ja sakate
 
 
 More than that, the fact is that she is the wife of Robert Vadra, who is accused of being involved in many cases of land scam and corruption
 vah behad khubasurat hai, lekin uske alaava unki koi rajnatik uplabdhi nahin he
 "actually, the decision to hand over the command of Eastern UP to Priyanka in UP is being considered very important for the Lok Sabha elections and the 2022 assembly elections
 ab yah charchaa tej ho gai he ki priyanka ke aane se upi main trikoniya muqabla ho gaya he
 Earlier there was a fight between the SP-BSP and the BJP directly, but now the Congress is back in the electoral battle

 Taking its moral responsibility, Patil should resign immediately from his post

 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that if our government comes to the Center, we will bring a strong law from POTA
 unhone kaha ki visphot ke peeche iesai kaa haath he
 In a message sent from Salem in Tamil Nadu, BJP President Rajnath Singh said that the terrorists have declared war against the country and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seems to have forgotten his promise to fight terrorism

 a child died and 18 others were injured in a blast in Mehrauli area of the capital on Saturday
 tamilnadu ke kuddalor main ek chaunkaane vaali ghatana main vanniar samudaay ke kuch logon ne ek dalit yuvak par hamalaa kar diya
 When 20-year-old Ajit Kumar was going back home with his sister-in-law, he was attacked by 5 people from the Vanniyar community
 bike par savaar ajit kumaar ko pehle aropiyon ne roka or baad main hamalaa kar diya
 Ajit Kumar was first asked to take off the sunglass and asked him to take the bike on foot to the village
 ajit kumaar ne jab unki is maang ko maanane se inkaar kiya tha to gopi naam ke ek hamalavar ne ajit kii bhabhi ke saath durvyavhaar kiya
 After this the tension increased
 haalanki ajit kumaar or unki bhabhi ko to aropiyon ne jane diya, lekin kuch der baad gopi or uske kuch saathiyon ne ajit par hamalaa kar diya
 According to police, stones were hurled at Ajit Kumar and his father
 peedit ke mutabik unpar, unke pita or maa par hamalaa kiya gaya
 The police have arrested Gopi and five other accused in the case
 un par anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati adhinium ke khilaaf atyaachaar ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya
 But the most shocking thing for the victim and the villagers in this was the arrest of Ajit Kumar
 aaropee gopi kii shikaayat par police ne ajit kumaar ko giraftaar kiya
 Gopi and his associates alleged that Ajit attacked them as well
 haalanki dalit samudaay ke logon ne raajnneetik dalon par vanniar samudaay kaa samarthan karne or keval unke paksh main kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Giving clarification to the police officials, we are taking action on the complaint received
 adhikariyon ne daawa kiya ye jati aadhaarit hamalaa nahin tha
 bjp's BS Yeddyurappa has sworn in as the Chief Minister of Karnataka after relief from the Supreme Court
 lekin singhaasana par kabiz hone ke baad hi unki pariksha kii ghadi shuru hoti he
 BJP has 8 less than the number of mlas required for a majority
 aise main bahumat sabit karnaa apane aap main ek badi chunauti he
 However, BJP got 10 in the Supreme Court on Friday morning
 30 baje samarthak vidhayakon kii list saunpny he
 In such a situation, the day is saved today
 yediurppa mukhyamantri kii shapath le chuke hai
 After this they face the challenge of proving majority in the assembly
 lekin isse pehle unhen supreme court main bhi agnipariksha main paas hona hoga
 The letter of support will have to be kept in the court on Friday
 bataa den ki karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii 222 siton par aae nateezon main bijepi ko 104 siten mili hai, jo ki bahumat se 8 vidhayak kam he
 Congress has got 78 and JDS 37, BSP 1 and others 2 seats
 aise main bijepi bhale hi sabase badi party banakar ubhari ho, lekin bahumat se wo dur he
 Whereas Congress and JDS have joined hands after the results
 bijepi ne jahaan sabase badi party hone ke chalate sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya, ti vahiin jedies or congress ne gathbandhan karke vidhayakon kii paryaapt sankhya hone kaa hawala dekar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 After this, on Wednesday evening, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala sent an invitation to the BJP to form the government and gave Yeddyurappa time to prove his majority in 15 days
 yediurppane guuruuvaar subah 9 baje tay samay par mukhyamantri pad kaa shapath lee
 The BJP has been given 15 days to prove its majority
 aisi haalat main bijepi ko supreme court main shuukravaar subah 10
 The letter of the pro-legislators is to be handed over at 30 o'clock
 jabaki unke paas 104 vidhayak hi hai
 In such a situation, raising the support figure of 8 mlas to the BJP is a big challenge
 bies yediurppa mukhyamantri ke shapath lene ke baad ab ek hi vikalp bachataa he, ki bijepi supreme court kii tay samay seemaa se pehle agar vidhansabha kasadan bulaakar bahumat sabitkar sakati he
 In this strategy also, BJP will be successful only when about two and a half dozen mlas of Congress and JDS are not present in the House during majority
 vahiin bijepi ke sabhi vidhayak sadan main rahe or party ke paksh main voting karen
 If the BJP succeeds in doing this, then it can avoid giving the list of 112 mlas
 vidhansabha ke bahumat ke bina par supreme court main raahat mil sakati he
 In this way Yeddyurappa can save his chair of the throne of power
 iske alaava doosraa koi rasta bijepi ke paas nahin he
 Delhi, once maligned as 'crime Capital', has once again become ashamed
 rashtriya rajdhani main chaar saal kii bacchee se rape kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 It is reported that a four-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her neighbor
 police ne bataaya ki simapuri main yah ghatana ghati
 The accused in the crime is absconding
 ladki ke pita ne jab apni beti kii dasha dekhi, to usne police main shikaayat kii

 ek taraf jahaan dilli cedipti siem manish sisodiyake ghar sibiai ke adhikari pahunche, to duusari taraf siem arvind kejariwal sarkari aspataalon kaa auchak nirikshan kar rahe the
 Kejriwal is also accompanied by Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain, who was taking stock of the facilities and arrangements in the hospital from the patients
 'ajtak' ko mili video main nazar aa rahaa he ki arvind kejariwal haath me dawaai kaa ek parchaa lekar khadey hai
 Sources close to the CM said that he was waiting for the doctor after receiving a complaint from the patient about not having medicines
 aage video main ek mahila doctor kejariwal se aakar milti hai
 Showing the form of Kejriwaladwai, they are telling the doctor that this medicine is not present in the list of Madam counters
 dawaai nahin he, to doctor ne kyon likhi? jis doctor ne yah dawaai likhi he, use bulaaie
 In between videos, the woman is seen folding her hands in front of doctor Kejriwal
 iske aage kejariwal ek or marij kaa parchaa dikhaate hue aspataal se baahar nikalate hai, jahaan mahila doctor maujuud he
 In the video, the patient is complaining that the medicine is being asked to buy medicine from outside, on which Kejriwal is asking the doctor, whom to meet with him if the medicine is not available, where is it written? In the last of the video, Kejriwal is seen giving instructions to the health secretary, asking the doctor to put a board on the absence of medicines
 maaloom ho ki haal hi main siem kejariwal ne dilli ke aspataalon main dawaaiyon kii 50% kami kaa zikr karte hue chif secretary ko nirdesh jari kiye the
 Apart from this, questions were also raised about the payment and maintenance of medicines
 aise main kejariwal or swasthya mantri lagaataar aspataalon ke daure kar rahe hai, lekin tasviir dekhakar saaf hota he ki sarkari aspataalon main marijon ko dawaai ab bhi nahin mil paa rahi he
 Hospital administration is also not paying attention to this
 kya he Talk to AK ?- dilli sarkaar ne june 2016 ke aakhir main ye tay kiya ki mukhyamantri fasebuk, google, utyub ke jariye janata se sidhe samvaad karenge
 Questions will be asked and answers will be given to the public
 - iske liye dilli sarkaar ke soochna evam prachaar vibhaag (diypi) ko kaha gaya ki 8 july se is kaarykram ko lekar prachaar-prasar kare
 dip's reply came that they do not have the resources to propagate through youtube, Facebook, Google etc
 - isliye dilli sarkaar ke saath pehle se hi kaam kar rahi kansaltent agency ke parfect relation se poocha gaya ki kya wo is kaam ko karne main sakasham he?- parfect relation ne kaha ki google, fasebuk, utyub aise madhyam he, jinka duniya bhar main koi comptishan nahin he
 These are the only companies of its kind across the world
 isliye vigyaapan dene ke liye inkaa koi tender comptishan nahin ho saktaa
 - Consultant company Perfect Relations said that they can get this work done by Google, Facebook, youtube at the rate set by them
 - kansaltent company parfect relation ne 6 july ko apana prapojal diya
 - The government gave this work to Perfect Relations with the following 3 conditions

 The Consultant Company shall not take any principality, rebate or commission from these companies and if the Consultant gets any kind of Principal, exemption or commission or any other benefit, it will be deducted from its bills
 - is kaam ke liye kansaltent company ko diypi ke saath anubandh uplabdh sharto ke alaava kisi bhi tarah kaa charge nahin diya jayega
 - Government will not give any advance payment for this nor will real time payment be given
 bhugtan ektual bill jamaa karne ke baad hi kiya jayega
 In this case, DIP sent the complete information file in this regard to the Finance Department of Delhi Government on 8 July 2016
 vitt vibhaag ne in baton ko ejamin karke 11 july 2016 ko kaha ki department ise cabinet apruval ke liye le jaae
 - On July 17, this program was completed smoothly
 - vitt vibhaag ke prastaav par puure maamle ko ek sitambar ko cabinet ke apruval ke liye rakhaa gaya or iske bhugtan ko cabinet ne manjuuri de di
 - Former Deputy Governor Najeeb Jung lodged a CBI case in this matter
 - samaj nahin aata ki jab sarkaar ne cost tu cost, bina mashin or bina advance pement kiye pehle se kaam kar rahi kansaltent agency ko bina kisi atirikt bhugtan ke ye kaam safaltaapurvak karaayaa to isamen ghotaalaa kahaan hua?- kya cost tu cost bina kamishan kaam karana ghotaalaa he?- kya mukhyamantri kaa fasebuk, utyub google ke jariye janata se samvaad ghotaalaa he?

 intervyuu main sabase zyada puche jate hai ye 8 sawaal Rating: 2 Director: Bijoy Nambiarakalakar: Amitabh Bachchan, Farhan Akhtar and Aditi Rao Hydari are the details of suspense thriller
 kis tarah jaal buna jaataa he, or kis tarah ant main us jaal ke ek-ek taar ko joda jaataa he
 Perhaps Bijoy Nambiar did not understand this deeply and he was able to make a suspense thriller a very obvius film
 shaayad yah bollywood ke diarectaron kii kami bhi he ki vah hollywood kii tarj par suspence thriller to bananaa chaahate hai lekin kahani or paatro par apni pakad nahin rakh pate hai
 Result: The fun of the film gets gritty
 vaise film ke produsar vidhu vinod chopra ne'vajeer'kii relies se pehle kaha tha ki vah is film ko hollywood main bananaa chaahate the
 Looking at the film, it seems that perhaps it would have been better if he had made the film in Hollywood
 kahani kii batfarhaan akhtar aties afasar hai
 He has a wife
 ek din aatankiyon ke saath muthbhed main vah apni sabase keemtee cheez kho baithte hai
 He begins to live in the fire of remorse and his wife also blames him for that precious loss
 isi dauraan unki mulakaumitabh bachchanase hoti he, jo divyang hai
 He is a tremendous chess player
 vah haadase ke shikaar hai or unke jivan kaa dard bhi kuch-kuch farhaan jaisaa he
 Then comes a time that Farhan, along with his trouble, starts solving Amitabh's problem too
 phir kai rahasyon par se pardaa uthta he or kai baaten saamne laai jaati hai
 The on-off of the story is very annoying
 suspence thriller kii aatma missing lagati he, kamjor kahani or treetment kii vajah se film lachar ban jaati he
 If Farhan and Amitabh's roles were changed from each other, then perhaps something in the film could have been done that would have been beyond thinking, perhaps the film could have brought the Hollywood test
 star apishmitabh bachchan ne utana acha kaam kiya he jo ve wheelchair par baithkar kar sakate the
 He has given life to his character as a chess player
 film kii euaspy vahi hai, or unhen dekhnaa aaj bhi sukhad he
 On the other hand, Farhan Akhtabhi is fine
 lekin unako dekhakar thrill paidaa nahin hota he
 Bollywood has not yet matured in terms of characterization
 yahi baat film main khalati he
 If you are old, make the person in a wheelchair
 aditya raav hydari ke liye kuch khaas karne ko he nahin
 Neil Nitin Mukesh and John Abraham would not have made much difference if there was someone else
 kamai kii batpichley kuch saal se janvari maheenaa bollywood ke liye bahut lucky nahin rahaa he or isamen relies hone vaali adhiktar filmon ne box offis par kamyaabi kaa munh nahin dekha he
 But this time Bollywood has tried to break this myth and many big films are being released
 'vajeer' uski shuruyaat he or saal kii pehali sabase badi relies bhi
 The budget of the film is around 40-50 crores
 ke bich bataaya jaataa he
 But in terms of thriller, the film does not wake up very much and a big record cannot be expected, but due to Amitabh and Farhan, how far it goes at the box office, it will be interesting to see
 puure desh main 21 june ko yoga diwas par apane apane dhang se kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 Popularly known as Yoga City, the world famous Bihar Yoga School in Munger, Bihar has organized yoga program from the pargana of the ashram to the courtyard of the house instead of the square intersections
 iske liye logon se apil kii gai he ki subah 6
 Perform asanas and pranayam on the terrace, verandah, courtyard or other open space of your house or community center for one hour from 00 am
 bihar yoga vidhyalay dwaara is sambandh main jari patr ke anusaar main om mantra kaa uccharan do baar shuru or ant main hoga
 Five cycles will also be Surya Namaskar
 is puure kaarykram kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki yoga diwas ke avasar par shaam ko bhi ek ghante kaa aayojan kiya gaya he
 Bihar Yoga School has considered yoga as a discipline, science and lifestyle, saying that man can achieve perfection in his life through yoga, but also said about June 21 that this day is completely day and night
 They are unbalanced because the day is the largest and the night is the smallest and at such times yoga is not as good
 tippaniyan Bihar Yoga School which was established in Munger in 1963
 yah vidhyalay satyanand yoga ke naam se puure vishwa main yoga kaa prachaar-prasar karata he
 Although currently its chief Swami Niranjanananda is not speaking publicly about Yoga Day, experts say that he is not happy with politics and criticism through yoga
 isliye bihar yoga vidhyalay dwaara yoga diwas ke kaarykram main surya namaskara se lekar om mantra kaa uccharan ek tarah se un logon ko khuli chunauti hai jo in dinon yoga diwas ke madhyam se har din nayaa shigupha chhod rahe hai
 However, Bihar Yoga School says that the program of yoga is being announced by them from the courtyard of the ashram to the roof of the house to the courtyard of the house, after requesting guidance from many individuals and institutions regarding the Yoga Day

 However, Bihar Yoga School says that the program of yoga is being announced by them from the courtyard of the ashram to the roof of the house to the courtyard of the house, after requesting guidance from many individuals and institutions regarding the Yoga Day
 bihar yoga vidhyalay ne yoga ko ek vidya, vigyaan or jivan style maanate hue kaha he ki manushya apane jivan main yoga ke madhyam se kitni bhi purnataa praapt kar saktaa he, lekin 21 june ke bare main bhi kaha ki is din din-raat puri tarah asantulit hote hai kyonki din sabase bada or raat sabase choti hoti he or aise samay yoga utana thik nahin hota he
 The comments bihar yoga vidhyalay jo munger main 1963 main sthapit kiya gaya tha
 This school promotes yoga all over the world in the name of Satyanand Yoga
 haalanki vartmaan main iske pramukh swami niranjananand yoga diwas ke bare main saarvajanik rup se kuch nahin bol rahe he, lekin jaankaron kaa kahana he ki yoga ke madhyam se raajnneeti or aalochana se ve khush nahin hai
 So the pronunciation of Om Mantra from Surya Namaskar to Yoga Day program by Bihar Yoga School is in a way an open challenge to those who are leaving new Shigufa every day through Yoga Day
 haalanki bihar yoga vidhyalay kaa kahana he ki unke dwaara ashram ke aangan se ghar kii chat angan tak yoga ke kaarykram kii ghoshnaa anek vyaktiyon or sansthaaon ke yoga diwas ke sandarbh main maargdarshan ke anurodh ke baad kiya ja rahaa he

 The commission has given written notice to the Chief Secretary of the state seeking answers as to the circumstances and circumstances in which these encounters were carried out and whether the standards set in these encounters were followed
 notice ke mutabik, pichley chah maheenon main 433 encounters kiye gaye jisamen 19 apradhi maare gaye or 89 apradhi ghayal hue
 During these encounters, 98 personnel of the state police were also injured in which one was also killed
 is notice ko lekarutar pradesh kaa police mahakamapashopesh main he kyonki enechaarsi ke notice ke baad unki aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf muhim ko jhatka lag saktaa he
 However, the top officials of Uttar Pradesh are also talking about giving a suitable answer on this
 ediji lau and order UP police anand kumaar ne kaha, 'enechaarsi ne haal kii ghatnaon kaa hawala dete hue poocha he ki kya muthbhedon main kisi tarah kii koi kotahi barti gai he
 The reason is also clear that in recent days, after the Yogi government came, there has been a lot of increase in the number of encounters and encounters of criminals
 aankadon ke mutabik pichley 8 maheene main kareeb 3000 apradhi pakade gaye hai jisamen bahut saare inami badmaash bhi shaamil he iske alaava police kii dharpakad ke chalate bahut se aparaadhiyon ne pradesh ke baahar panaah lee he

 Criminals can also see such a swift action by the police and the NHRC has also expressed its concern about the increasing number of encounters
 yahi vajah he ki enechaarsi ne pradesh sarkaar ko notice bheja he
 However, no matter what the reply to the notice is, but experts believe that such an attitude of the commission will prevent the police from engaging so that there is no question of their action

 Now the real question is when, where and how will this challenge proceed? Will the Supreme Court be able to hear it? Will the privilege of Parliament not come in the way? Since such an occasion has never come in the history of independent India and the framers of the Constitution had not even imagined such a terrible situation, what steps should be taken in the event of such a situation and how? ? Impeachment is administrative action or legislative? The first screw is the process of impeachment is administrative or legislative, so far as it is administrative And question the constitution silence
 agar yah maamla vidhaayi he to aise maamle main iske istemaal kaa koi mauka ab tak aayaa hi nahin yani koi nazeer hi nahin milti to aakhir is fanse hue fachchar ko nikaalen to kaise? chunki maamla vidhaayi he to nyaaypalika isamen dakhal hi nahin degi or prashasnic he to jeudicial rivyuu koun kare?sunwaayee koun si peeth kare?jeudicial rivyuu ho to bada mudda yah kisupreme courtmen is yachika kii sunwaayee koun si peeth karegi? rajyasabha ke paden sabhapati or desh keuparashtrapati em venkaiya naidune supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog chalaane ke notice ko rad kar diya he
 Now the opposition is challenging Naidu's move in the Supreme Court
 maamla supreme court gaya to vahaan yah koun tay karegaa ki koun si peeth vipaksh kii us yachika ko sune jisamen rajyasabha ke sabhapati ke kadam ko chunauti di gai he
 The Master of Roster, ie the Chief Justice, cannot hear it himself, but the big question is, who will hear this petition? Not even the top five judges, including Justice Deepak Mishra, are at the center of the whole case
 He kept listening
 rahi baat number do yani justise chelmeshwar kii to rajyasabha sabhapati ne apane note main justise chelmeshwar sahit un chaaron jajon ke naam likhe hai jinhone chif justise ke kaamkaaj ke taur tareekon par asantosh jataate hue unke khilaaf khuleam bayaan die the
 Therefore, with number two Justice Chelameswar, number three Justice Tarun Gogoi, number four Madan b Lokur and number five Kurian Joseph have also become party, so even these justices cannot attend the hearing
 aise main bachate hai varishthata kram main number chah se number das tak ke justise
 That is, if we look at Justice AK Sikri, Justice Sharad Bobde, Justice RK Aggarwal, Justice MV Ramana and Justice Arun Mishra
 samvidhan bhi he maun, nai vyakhya kii jaruratdilli hoicourt ke purv justise ares sodhi kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki chunki samvidhan is maamle main maun he lihaaja aisi sthiti kii samiksha or bhavishya ke liye samvidhan kii vyakhya supreme court ke paanch yaa zyada jajon kii samvidhan peeth hi tay karegi
 If the top five judges have gone to the top, then the bench will be made of the same judges, who were called by the complainants as juniors, and raised public objection to their inclusion in every Constitution bench and raised it in front of the media
 aise main unka is maamle kii sunwaayee karnaa nyaaysangat hoga yaa nahin, abhi yah bhi spasht nahin he
 It will be a matter of seeing which bench of the Supreme Court will hear this case stuck in many screws

 lekin ghar main unke liye badi mushkil saamne ai he, kyonki sindh praant ke sadan main imran ke is project ke khilaaf prastaav paas kiya he or ise lagu naa karne kii baat kahi he
 The House of Sindh Province passed this resolution on Monday
 gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki karachi-peshawar railway trek imran khan ke daure ke ahm projecton main se ek he
 The Sindh Legislative Assembly proposes that the Karachi Circular Railway project be paid attention to except for this track
 somvaar ko jab sadan main pakistan pipuls party (PPP) ke ganver isran kii ore se imran sarkaar ke khilaaf prastaav laayaa gaya, to prastaav paas ho gaya
 The Sindh government is demanding that when the Karachi Circular Railway project was already included in the CPEC with the consent of the Chinese government, why is the Federal Government of Imran Khan removing the project to include the karachi-peshawar railway track
 2016 main sindh sarkaar or chini sarkaar ke bich karachi circular railway project par samjhauta hua tha
 There were several meetings between the two from 2017-2018
 sindh sarkaar kaa daawa he ki KCR project karachi ke logon ke liye kaaphi rojgaar or nivesh laane vaala hoga, lekin imran sarkaar kaa faisla janata ke liye dhokhaa hoga
 Sindh Province Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has also appealed to Imran Khan regarding this and has demanded to guarantee the project
 unhone itnaa bhi kah diya he ki agarimran sarkaar isapar manjuuri nahin laati he to karachi-peshawar railway trek project ko sindh praant main lagu nahin karne diya jayega
 What is the CPEC project? It is worth mentioning that China and Pakistan together are building a china-pakistan Economic Corridor
 iske tahat china pakistan main kai tarah ke bade project par kaam kar rahaa he or arabon rupee kaa nivesh kar rahaa he
 Pakistan is in huge debt to China due to this investment, loan and project
 iskaa kuch hissaa pok se bhi hokar gujarata he, jiskaa bharat ne kai baar kadaa virodh kiya he
