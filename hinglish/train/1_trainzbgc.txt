 com / e5pguenqp2— ANI (@ani_news)june 13, 2016 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, after a stunning win over Pakistan on Saturday, believed that if the board had 100 or more runs on it, the result could have gone to either side
 gendbaajon kaa shandaar pradarshnadhoni ne match ke baad kaha, ‘meri team aakraamak cricket khelnaa pasand karti he lekin is match main hamane yahaan ke condishan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pradarshan kiya jo tii20 cricket ke liye behatar he
 i am very happy that we dismissed Pakistan for 83 runs
 agar yah total 100 yaa 110 ran hota to phir jo sthiti thi usamen kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 Our fast bowlers bowled brilliantly but even then we kept taking wickets at frequent intervals which is very important to prevent runs in this format
 ’dhoni ne kii team kii tarifhamen fielding par maidan main khaas dhyaan dena tha, yah ek aisa department he jisapar ham apane pradarshan kii guarantee de sakate hai
 a run out can completely withdraw the match from the opposition team
 ’ match ke baad patrakaron se dhoni ne kaha, ‘rhite length ball ko hit karnaa he
 If we keep taking wickets continuously, then there is pressure on them and this is what i said
 ham nahin jaanate ki is tarah ke wicket par kitna score chej kiya ja saktaa he lekin 83 kaa score paanaa aasaan hota
 Aamir's brilliant bowling, Dhoni said, 'things were difficult
 aamir ne jis tarah se bowling kii uske baad mili jeet shandaar he
 It is always great if you get the score scored by the opposing team or if you get it out at a low score
 ’is pradarshan ko aankane kii baat par dhoni ne kaha, ‘teen yaa paanch saal pehle kya hua is par main nahin sochataa
 There are other players whose performance was good, then one should not compare it with the earlier performance or the performance of cricketers
 ’kerani chahie team kii tarifunhone kaha, ‘team jiti he isaki aapako prashansa kerani chahie
 Many decisions are made under the strategy

 Mahendra Kumar Pahwa, 34, who runs a small drugstore in Haridwar, an area of quality, was troubled by a headache
 unhen lagata tha ki unka sir fat jayega
 Whenever there is a headache, no medicine works
 ve bataate hai, 'phir kareeb chaar saal pehle ek dost ne himgange tel niyamit lagane kii salaah di
 i started applying, and the headache disappeared
 ' iske baad paahwa ne apni dukaan par uskaa stock rakhana shuru kiya
 They did not sell Himganga before

 They consider it only in the category of 'cold oil' as no research exists to prove its therapeutic properties
 mana jaataa he ki aise tamaam 'thande tel' tanaav, anidra, sirdard or thakaan se raahat dilaate hai
 The market for all such oils is Rs 700 crore
 kaa he, jisamen himgange kaa hissaa 28

 canada kii montrial uniwarsity main rasayanashastra ke professor rahe gautam burman ke pita jab 1971 main biimaar pade, to unhone bharat laut kar gharelu kaarobaar ko sanbhaalane kaa faisla kiya
 The Burman family of Banaras ran a large distribution company, but Gautam always wanted to do something on his own
 train ke safar main unhone dekha ki ek yatri kaaphi teji se apane baalo main tel laga rahaa tha
 Then they decided that they would make oil
 rasayanashastra kii prishthbhumi ne unki madad kii or ve maheenon telon, aushadhiyon or khushabuon ke saath prayog karte rahe
 Then in 1987, he introduced Himgange oil into the market
 is kaarobaar main mode tab aayaa jab unhone may, 2005 main ise banaras se haridwar shift karne kaa faisla liya
 The newly created Uttarakhand state was then offering 10-year exemption on excise duty and 5-year tax holiday to the industrialists there to attract investors
 burman ne apane kaarkaane main swachaalit packaging mashine lagaayee, jabaki banaras main adhiktar kaam haath se kiya jaataa tha

 Gujarat Tea Processors and Packers Ltd
, popularly known as 'chuski Jo Bain Rishtewagh Goat Tea Makers'
 company jab kisi nae bazaar main pravesh karti he to sabase pehle vahaan kaa pani or doodh chakhti he
 Chaipattis are made for that area according to water and milk
 masalan, dakshin gujarat main log kriim vaala doodh pite hai, to yahaan bechi jane vaali vaagh bakrii chaay aisi hoti he jo doodh ke gadhepan ke saath ghul kar apni khushboo or maujuudagi darj kara sake
 Paras Desai, the fourth generation member of the family that founded the company, is the executive director who handles sourcing and operations
 ve bataate hai, 'adhiktar bhartiya doodh or chini vaali chaay pite hai
 That is why we first examine these and then try to give a leaf that can make a relationship with the local taste
 ' desai kii khud kii jabaan haalanki raat main bistar tak jate-jate sunn pad jaati he kyonki dinabhar main ve kareeb 500 namoonay chakhte hai
 He says, "even as a family, we are very sensitive to tea and try hard to reach the right taste to the customer
 'jaahir he, is company se aap aisi patibaddhta kii ummid bhi kar sakate hai kyonki isaki sthapana ke peeche mahatma gandhi kii prerana he
 Gandhiji called Narendra Das Desai in 1892 to take stock of the tea market in South Africa where he practiced
 desai vahaan gaye or unhone ek chaay bagan bhi kharid liya, lekin ve usee vajah se laut aae jis vajah se gandhiji ko aana padaa- nasli bhedbhaav
 When he returned, he had a letter from Gandhiji in which Desai was told of tea
 isi ne unhen 1919 main gujarat tii depo company kholane kii prerana di
 In 1925 he launched the Wagh Goat brand which was based on Gandhiji's principle of harmony in which a tiger and goat were shown drinking tea from the same cup
 is brands naam ke peeche yahi mul vichaar tha
 In Gujarati, tiger is called wagh
 paras ke chachere bhai or marketings va cells ke pramukh or kaaryakari nideshak paraag desai kehete hai, 'yah brands sadbhaav ko pradarshit karata he or dikhaata he ki chaay kaise rishton ko jod sakati he
 'being a Gujarati businessman means being dissatisfied, the same is true with this company
 ek vakt aayaa jab desai parivaar ne tay kiya ki ab gujarat se baahar nikalnaa he or hindustan uniliver or tata jaise khilaadiyon se do-do haath karne hai jinka 80 fisadi bazaar par kabja he
 In Gujarat, 50 percent of the consumption is of Wagh goat
 yah rajasthan, madhyapradesh, andhra, maharashtra, goa, dilli, hyderabad, chhattisgarh or karnataka main bhi bikati he jo ise echuel or tata ke bazaar se itar desh kaa sabase bada brands banaati he
 The start of these three regional companies is interesting
 inhone sthaneey bazaar kii jaruraton ko acchhee tarah samajha, apni shuruaati safalataa ko peshewar andaaj main bhunaaya, kaarobaar ko badhaayaa or bazaar hissedari ke boote loha manvaaya he
 These brands are falsifying the notion that regional brands are cheap and advertise Baselike

 This is the secret of their success

 Indian batsman Lokesh Rahul hoped that his main off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin would also be able to match Nathan Lyon's performance on this pitch which started to deteriorate from day one
 leone ne 50 ran dekar aath wicket hasil kiye jisase bhartiya team australia ke khilaaf duusare test ke pehle hi din pehali pari main mahaj 189 ran par simat gai, lekin rahul date rahe
 Rahul said in the post-match press conference, "we know that Ash (ashwin) is the top-level bowler and once he gets a couple of wickets, he will be in rhythm, then he will destroy the Australian batting line up
 , We are confident of this
 " rahul ne yah bhi kaha ki ravindra jadeja bhi upyogi sabit ho sakate hai, agar vah pich kaa istemaal utani hi prabhaavshaalee tareeke se karen jaisaa leone ne kiya
 The comments unhone kaha, "jadeja ko aaj itani zyada gendbaaji karne ko nahin mili lekin leone kii tarah vah bhi baayen haath ke ballebaajon ko aaf stump se baahar kaaphi gendbaaji kar saktaa he
 If he bowls like this, he will also get a lot of wickets
 " rahul ne kaha ki daraaren shuru ho gai hai or is wicket par ballebaaji karnaa mushkil hi hoga
 He said that the wicket is very similar to what he used to play for Karnataka in Ranji Trophy matches but cracks do not happen so quickly during domestic matches
 rahul ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki yah usee tarah kaa wicket he jaisaa ki hamen ranjai trophy main miltaa he
 Perhaps the cracks begin at the end of the second or third day
 lekin yahaan wicket kaaphi sookhaa tha or daraaren kaaphi zyada thim
 "this young player missed out on scoring 100 runs
 unke kandhe main thodi pareshaani thi lekin unhone kaha ki chikitsa ke liye brake lene kaa koi matlab nahin tha
 He said, "medical treatment at that time does not benefit me much
 isaliye maine khelnaa jari rakhane ke bare main sochaa or kuch shaat khilne kii koshish kii jo mere liye phydemand nahin rahaa
 " rahul ne match ke baad press conference main kaha, "ham jaanate hai ki aish (aswin) sheersh stareey gendbaaj hai or ek baar vah ek do wicket hasil kar legaa to lay main aa jayega, tab vah australian ballebaaji line ap ko tahas nahas kar degaa, hamen iskaa puraa bharosa he
 "rahul also said that Ravindra Jadeja can also prove to be useful if he uses the pitch as effectively as Leon did
 tippaniyan He said, "jadeja did not get to bowl that much today but like Leon he can bowl a lot of left-handed batsmen out of the off stump
" agar vah aisi gendbaaji karegaa to use kaaphi wicket bhi milenge
 "rahul said that cracks have started and it will be difficult to bat on this wicket
 unhone kaha ki wicket kaaphi kuch usee tarah kaa he jaisaa ki unhen ranjai trophy maichon main karnataka ke liye khilne ko miltaa tha lekin gharelu maichon ke dauraan daraaren itani jaldi nahin padati
 Rahul said, "I think it is the same kind of wicket as we get in Ranji Trophy
 shaayad daraaren duusare yaa tisare din ke ant main shuru hoti hai
 But here the wicket was very dry and the cracks were very high
 " yah yuva khilaadi 100 ran banane se chook gaya
 He had some shoulder problems but said there was no point in taking a break for therapy
 unhone kaha, "us samay chikitsiya upachaar se mujhe zyada phayda nahin hota
 So i thought of continuing playing and tried to play some shots which were not beneficial for me
 " He said, "jadeja did not get to bowl that much today but like Leon he can bowl a lot of left-handed batsmen out of the off stump

 The ban on airplane travel of Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad is about to be beaten up by an Air India employee
 shivasena ke netaa is baat par ade hue hai kii sarkaar kisi bhi tarah se rabindra gaekwad par lage bain ko hatwane jisaki vajah se vah kisi bhi airlines he yatra nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Amidst this controversy, on Friday, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy raised the matter further by saying that unless Ravindra Gaikwad directly apologizes, he should not be banned
 subramanyam swamine kaha ki shivasena ke saansad ne chappal uthaaya he kisi bhi saansad ko yah kisi bhi haalat main shobhaa nahin detaa ki vah kisi ke upar chappal uthaae
 Whatever the condition
 unki ek shikaayat ho sakati he ki air india ke karmchaaree thik bartaav nahin karte yaa ghamand main rahete hai
 But under no circumstances can this be done by raising MP slippers
 jab tak vah sidhe taur par maafee nahin maangate hai tab tak roak jari rahanaa chahie
 The Shiv Sena should tell them to apologize to anyone and not turn around
 jab tak aisa nahin hota tab tak un par roak jari rakhana thik he
 The government is trying to find a middle ground on the case of Ravindra Gaikwad
 shivasena is maamle ko lekar lagaataar sarkaar par dabaav bana rahi he
 The Shiv Sena has even threatened to not allow any flight from Mumbai if the matter is not heard
 shivasena ne yah dhamkee bhi di he ki rabindra gaekwad par bain nahin hataa to vah NDA ki somvaar ko hone vaali baithak kaa bhi bahishkaar karenge
 It was also reported on Friday that Ravindra Gaikwad tried to book a ticket from Air India for the seventh time but his ticket has been canceled
 haalanki is bare main puche jane par ravindra gayakwad or sanjay ravat donon ne is baat se inkaar kiya or kaha ki unki taraf se koi tikat book nahin karaayaa gaya
 The case of Ravindra Gaikwad has also caught on because Shiv Sena leader Anant Geete had a quarrel with Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Thursday
 ashok gajpati raju pidipi ke netaa hai or kaha ja rahaa he ki shivasena ke is vyavhaar ko telugu desham party ne bahut gambhirtha se liya he
 Despite the tensions in the Lok Sabha, Ashok Gajapathi Raju is firm on his stand that the case of Binarvindra Gaikwad, apologizing, cannot be brought to an end

 gulzaar sahab ne khud likhaa he ki kahaniyon ke kai rukh hote hai
 There is no such goal that there is only one look from every side

 Diyodhi will also take you through many trails

 The mention of 100 rupees in the friendship of lyricists Sahir Ludhianvi and Javed Akhtar (magic) makes it invaluable
 100 rupee, sahir kii maut or javed akhtar kaa foot-foot kar ronaa aapaki ankhon ko bhi nam kar jayega
 Gulzar saheb has observed the india-pakistan partition very closely and has written a lot on it earlier, because his own childhood was also missed on the other side of the border
 'kuldeep naiyar or pir sahab' main gulzaar sahab ne bataaya he ki kaise pir sahab bhi bantwaare kii khai se nahin batch paae
 When Gulzar saheb and Nayyar saheb are going towards the Bagha border, Nayar saheb tells them, 'if this road continues straight, do not ask for any visa, nor see any passport, and if i come to Pakistan, what? Will i rob you of that country? The looters are neither lacking in this country, nor in that country
 unhen baahar se aane kii jarurat kya he?'ye dard naa jane kitne hi hindustani or pakistani ke jahan main hoga, lekin siyasat kii lakeeren khinchi to kise parvaah insaani jajbaton kii?padhein: gulzaar ke naam khulaa khat

 Every major country in the world has a public or government broadcasting system
 uske hone kii bhi koi na koi vajah hogi hi
 Before discussing the shortcomings of Prasar Bharati, the autonomous body that oversees Doordarshan (DD) and All India Radio, we should note that its autonomy despite constitution under a law passed in Parliament in 1990 is two sections 32 And is bound by 33, who withdraws what she gives to him with one hand, with the other hand
 ye dharaaen tay kar detii hai ki niyuktiyaan, seva sharten, vetan or tamaam mahatvapurn faisle soochna-prasaaran mantralay ke paas hi rahenge
 Prasar Bharati's board has been reconstituted from time to time by several governments but no one has bothered to form a 'parliamentary Committee' of 22 mps nor a 'broadcasting Council' for complaints to oversee its functioning in accordance with the law
 iske alaava kanoon ke mutabik 'na khatm hone vaale kosh’ kii hi vyavastha kii gai, jiskaa matlab yah hota he ki sab kuch 'pehle kii hi tarah’ chalata rahegaa or mantralay kaa kosh or kaamkaaj par niyantran bana rahegaa
 Broadcasting is a highly technical subject and the programs and engineering departments of All India Radio and later Doordarshan have gradually taken over in 78 and 55 years respectively
 mantralayon ko yah samaj paanaa aasaan nahin he
 Technology is changing rapidly and digitization and social media have changed the appearance of print and broadcast media to a great extent
 lekin prasar bharti kaa vishaal takneekee tamzam sarkaar kii khayraat par nirbhar he, isliye uske paas anivaary badlaav or aadhunikeekaran ke liye har saal 340 karod ru
 There is no option but to go through the lengthy procedures of the government for the budget of Rs
 prasarak ne lagbhag bekaar padi kareeb 100 sampatti ke bare main faisla lene kaa prastaav sarkaar ko de diya he
 All these assets have been attributed to Prasar Bharati, but for 17 years the Information and Broadcasting Ministry has not been able to decide its 'conditions'
 prasar bharti kaa board tay kar chukaa he ki dilli main kareeb 20,000 karod ru
 Some of its assets can be assigned to entities like DDA, HUDCO or NBCC to form a residential colony and make capital investment in Doordarshan and All India Radio from its annual income
 is tarah kareeb 2,000 karod ru
 With this, FM services can be expanded so that about 70 crore cellphone holders can get all services of AIR
 lekin soochna-prasaaran mantralay ne iske prati vicitra lalaphitaashahee andaaj main 'naa’ kah diya kyonki aatmanirbhar prasar bharti mantralay ke sur main sur milaanaa shaayad band kar de
 An open illustration of this control is seen in the news department of AIR and Doordarshan, which has officers appointed, posted and can be punished from the ministry in about 200 high positions
 in adhikariyon par prasar bharti kaa koi vash nahin chalata
 He only provides them service, money and help and takes the blame of their actions on his forehead
 soochna-prasaaran mantralay ko yah samajhane kii tamaam koshishen naakaam ho gai hai ki yah swaittata ke khilaaf he
 If such a 'shadow' remains on the news heads, then controversies like the editing of some part of Narendra Modi's interview will continue to arise
 desh main shaayad hi koi aisi saarvajanik sanstha hogi, jahaan 20 saal se koi niyukti na hui ho or padonnati par bhi mantralay kaa kadaa paharaa ho
 In the last 20-30 years, out of about 33,000 employees, only a select few have been promoted
 iskaa sabase bura asar karmchaariyon ke manobal or anushaasan par padaa he
 Despite almost two years of continuous efforts, the ministry has not been able to set up Prasar Bharati Appointment Board as per law
 pichley do dashak main kareeb 15,000 pad khatm ho chuke hai jabaki tivi or radio steshnon kii sankhya doguni hokar 480 or duusare thikaanon kii sankhya 2,000 ho gai he
 P
 chidambaram kii aguai main mantri-samooh ne 2009 main 3,452 ahm padon ke srijan kii sifarish kii thi lekin sarkaar ke kaan par jun nahin rengi
 What can be more absurd than this, that the Ministry has given a show cause notice to Prasar Bharati for expanding the four bedless TV stations in the Hindi belt of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 roj 3-4 ghante prasaaran vaale in steshnon ko 24 ghante chalane waalon main badal diya gaya tha
 Similarly, due to myopic babushahi, India lost in the race for Vice President for the world's largest broadcaster union
 pichley paanch maah se pitroda cameti kii report par charchaa bhi nahin ho saki he
 Hundreds of experts have sworn their heads on this report
 vajah: yah report sampurna swaittata kii sifarish karti he
 Autonomy and bureaucracy are natural enemies
 inaki kashmakash kaa khamiyaja ek ke baad duusari sarkarein uthaati rahi hai
 This is possible only when the new boss babus are taken captive of their intentions
 ’91 ke baad udaarikaran ke daur main yah sabit hua he
 There is only scope for one type of thinking in India
 (purv samskruti sachiv jawahar sarkaar 2012 se prasar bharti ke siio hai) CM Yogi Adityanath arrived at the VHP saint conference in Sangam city
 yahaan unhone gaay-ganga or mandir ke par bolte hue kaha, 'sab kaam ho rahe hai dhairya rakhie
 During PM Modi's tenure, all the big things are being done without asking
 isliye hamen dhairya rakhana chahie ki sabhi bade kaam honge, jo sant samaaj chahta he
 'yogi further said,' Slaughterhouses closed as soon as we arrived, animal smuggling was stopped
 desh ke andar 12 lakh sant hai
 There are ashrams that have the capacity, it is their responsibility to also participate in the protection and promotion of the Go dynasty
 sarkaar bhi apane str se koshish kar rahi he
 But the protection of the Go dynasty should be a society based system
 'yogi ne kaha, 'kumbh kii vyavastha ke liye santon kaa maardarshak mandal banegaa
 For the first time, a Prime Minister is thinking so much for Ganga
 ganga kii nirmalata or aviralata ke liye kaam ho rahaa he
 He said, 'for the first time since independence, casteism and communal forces are raising their heads
 isse ladanaa hoga
 Every village has 1-2 saints, their responsibility is to stop the divisive forces
 hamaari sarkarasantonke aadesh kaa aksharasah paalan karegi
 'yogi said,' Israeli PM came
 maine dekha ki bharat ke prati unke man main kitna sammaan he
 ' hamaara sharir apane aap main ek anuthi mashin he, jiskaa har poorja apane hisse kaa kaam bina ruke karata rahata he, lekin agar kisi tarah kii laaparvaahee ho to beemaari apana sir uthaane lagati he or ek hisse kii beemaari duusare angon par bhi asar daalati he
 Kidney is an important part of our body and negligence towards it can be fatal
 haal ke varshon main khan paan or dincharya main badlaav ke chalate duniyabar main kidney kii beemaari se prabhavit logon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 In medical science, a disease called chronic kidney disease (CKD) means the kidney stops functioning
 iske bare main jaagrukta failaane ke liye 14 march ko "world kidney de" manaaya jaataa he
 The theme of "world Kidney Day" of 2019 is "kidney Health for Every One, Every Ware"
 antarrashtriya mahila diwas ke aasapaas aane vaale is din par mahilaon ko is rog ke bare main vishesh rup se jaagruk kiye jane kii jarurat he
 According to Dr
 Rajesh Agarwal, Senior Consultant Nephrologist at Shri Balaji Action Medical Institute, on an average, 14 percent of women and 12 percent of men in the country suffer from kidney problems and 19 worldwide
 5 karod mahilaayein kidney kii samasya se peedit he
 In India also this number is increasing rapidly, here every year 2 lakh people fall prey to this disease
 shuruuaati avasthaa main beemaari ko pakad paanaa mushkil hota he, kyonki donon kidney 60 pratishat kharaab hone ke baad hi mariz ko iskaa pataa chal paata he
 He told that the kidney or kidney is an organ like 'rajma', which is situated on the back side of the right and left parts of the stomach
 kidney karaab hone par sharir main khun saaf nahin ho paata or creatnin badhane lagata he
 If both kidneys are not able to do their work, then it is called kidney failure in common language
 narayana super speshility aspataal, gurugram main kansaltent nefrology or renal transplant visheshgy doctor sudeep singh ke anusaar khun ko saafe kar blad cirkulation main madad karne vaale gurde kai kaarnon se kharaab ho sakate hai
 Apart from these bad eating habits, regular intake of analgesics can also be a major reason
 dharmshila narayana super speshility hospital kii diarector or senior kansaltent nefrology doctor suman lata ne kaha , "is world kidney de" ham diabetes, hai blad pressure yaa lambe samay se kisi beemaari se peedit logon se apni kidney ko swasth rakhane kii apil karte hai
 Simple tests like KFT with urin test are cheap and convenient method of kidney testing
 isamen laaparvaahee na baraten
 "they said that the risk of kidney disease in women increases due to urinary tract infections and adverse pregnancy conditions
 rog ke shuruuaati lakshanon main lagaataar ulti aana, bhukh nahin laganaa, thakaan or kamazori mahasoos hona, peshaab kii maatra kam hona, khuzali kii samasya hona, neend nahin aana or mansapeshiyon main khinchaav hona pramukh hai
 He told that kidney failure is the eighth major cause of death of women worldwide
 niyamit jaanch karaane se rog kii shuruuaat main hi iskaa pataa chal jaataa he or dawa se ise thik karnaa sambhav ho paata he , lekin yadi samay rahete iske bare main pataa na chale to khun ko saaf karne ke liye dialysis kii prakriya se guzarana padataa he yaa phir kidney badalawaani padati he , jo ek lambii , kharchili or kshtakaari prakriya he jo har jagah uplabdh bhi nahin he

 South African fast bowler Vernon Philander, who was the hero of the first Test victory against India, said that it was his strategy to curb the bat of Indian captain Virat Kohli, which he managed to execute
 kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue chah wicket lene vaale philendar ne kaha, ‘viraat behtareen ballebaaj hai or unke balle ko khamosh rakhana jaruri tha
 This is what we did

 i did not say anything to him
 main apane khilaadiyon kii hausalafajai kar rahaa tha or ham isi par focus karte hai
 "shopping more than practice in Africa, will win the series like this? According to PTI, Philander said," i knew that Virat is a big wicket and we were celebrating by getting him out
 ' unhone kaha ki bharat ke saamne sirf 208 ran kaa lakshya tha or unhen pataa tha ki tej akraman kii jimmedaari lekar unhen team ko acchhee sthiti main laana hoga
 Philander said, "when you have set a target of only 208 runs, then one has to take responsibility
 aap baad ke liye ruuk nahin sakate kyonki ho saktaa he ki baad main mauka nahin mili
 On giving Rohit a chance in place of Rahane, Kohli made this statement, he also took the wicket of r Ashwin, who scored 37 runs and tried to return India to the match
 bharat ne ek samay saat wicket 82 ran par ganvaa die the, lekin aswin or bhubaneshwar kumaar ne aathven wicket ke liye 49 ran jode
 Philander said, 'you need to be restrained in such times
 hamen pataa tha ki aakhri teen wicket le sakate hai or jo team sanyam rakhegi, vahi jeetegi
 We did the same thing

 Despite equalization of boys in success and practice, the gender gap in mathematics increases due to teachers underestimating girls
 ek nae shodh main yah baat saamne ai he
 Researchers say that boys outperform girls in mathematics from the primary school level, and the same situation continued
 yah halaat 1990 ke dashak ke aakhir main tha
 Joseph Robinson Kimpian, Associate Professor at New York University, said, "despite the changes in the educational field, our research has revealed that the gender differences in primary school level children in 2010 were the same as the ones at the same level in 1998
" Was between adhyayan main america ke ladke or ladakiyon ke vikasaatmak or shaikshanik parinaamon par najar rakhaa gaya

 The difference between boys and girls was more in terms of mathematics
 adhyayan main yah paaya gaya ki is langik antar ke liye chaatro ke prati shikshakon kii dharna bhi jimmedaar he
 In mathematics, teachers undermine girls as boys over performance in the subject
 neuyork vishvavidhyalay ke associat professor joseph robinsan kimpian ne kaha, shaikshanik kshetra main badlaavon ke baavjood, hamaare shodh main yah baat saamne ai he ki saal 2010 main praathmik vidyalayan str ke bacchon main langik str par antar vahi tha jo 1998 main isi str par bacchon ke bich tha
 The study monitored the developmental and educational outcomes of boys and girls in the United States
 tippaniyan Researchers started studies in 1998–1999 on boys and girls who attended elementary school with similar math skills, but by the time they reached third grade, the girls were left behind
 ladke or ladakiyon ke bich kaa yah antar ganit vishay ke sandarbh main adhik tha
 The study found that teachers' perception of students is also responsible for this gender difference

 Small cities in India are now opening
 or badlaav kii is kahani ke centre main mard nahin hai
 In the four metros and 12 small cities where this survey was conducted, Rajasthan's quota is on top in terms of sexual fantasy, nan sukh robbery (voirism) and separation of emotions from sex
 maharashtra kaa kolhapur pornography ke maje, sabase zyada charam sukh hasil karne or kishoravastha se pehle yon sambandhon kaa anubhav lene main awwal he
 Jamnagar Blind Date of Gujarat is at the forefront of masturbation and oral sex
 mizoram ke izol ke log sabase zyada pyaar main padate hai or shaadi se pehle yon gatividhiyon ke maamle main sabase aage hai
 In Kottayam, Kerala, the most liberal approach is adopted in extramarital affairs and the city is also ahead in the use of sexual enhancement tools
 uttar pradesh kaa muradabad sage-sambandhiyon se younachaar ke prati jaagrukta ke maamle main awwal he
 The people of Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh are at the top in terms of getting excitement by seeing their partners take off their clothes
 tamilnadu main selem ke log partner kii talash ke liye soshal media kaa sabase zyada istemaal karte hai or sex ko taalane ke liye sirdard kaa bahaanaa banane main bhi sabase aage hai
 Guntur residents of Andhra Pradesh are on top in terms of saying yes to One Night Stand

 "miss x stands there thinking that she is the same woman who always boasted about her behavior inside her bedroom
" ve bataatin, ‘‘apane 30 varsh ke vivaahit jivan main maine bhi bhi sex ke liye pahal nahin kii
 Miss x says sighing, "nothing has changed here
" ’’ baaki ke mahanagaron kii tarah unhen chote shaharon main sex ko lekar ek baar phir sochane kii jarurat he
 Govindpur is changing
 ab sadakon par bajaj chetak scooter or maaruti alto kaaren najar aane lagi hai
 The all-new shopping complex has added a bit of urban modernism to this old-fashioned space and women's wear: the scarf for girls is now a symbol of tehzib, and the paint of jeans is no longer out of power

 The way small cities are opening their purses, so too are their suppressed sexual desires

 'this was the only family in the colony which had two daughters
 trade union netaa pita or teacher maa kii yah beti colony kii ekmaatr aisi ladki thi jisaki ladakon se dosti thi
 He said, "no other girl used to do this
 ladkiyaan chhupakar aas-paas ke ladako se baat karne yaa prem patron ko dene-lene ke liye kabhi-kabhaar chat par jaaya karti thim
 But she never spoke to the boys in the open
 ’’lekin ab lagata he ki vah saamaajik bandish ateet kii baat ho gai he
 67% of women in small towns have agreed to kiss men
 74 fisadi auraton ne 12 se 21 varsh kii umr main pehle chumban kaa swaad chakhaa
 So 18 per cent also believe that it was not meant to show any love or romantic sentiment
 miss eks ko pehali baar apane hi kalege ke 19 varshiya ladke se pyaar ho gaya tha
 "it was completely based on emotion and did not last long," she says
 ’’ unhen is baat kaa ehsaas bhi ho gaya ki ve apane jivan-saathi main jis gun kii sabase zyada chahat rakhti hai, vah us ladke main he hi nahin: dimag
 They thought it was rare
 haalanki ab saat saal baad unki yah dharna badal gai he
 21 per cent of the women surveyed claim that they have "gone on a date with men" - 40 per cent of them say they have dating more than one man
 kya dating gahare antarang sambandhon main badalati he? ji haa
 Nearly 19 percent of women say that they have had their first experience of sex in adolescence, while two percent believe that they had experienced this before
 ve apane partner main kya dhundhati hai? 51 fisadi se zyada auraten ‘eemaandaaree or nishtha’ jaise prashansaneey gunon kii talash karti hai lekin 64 fisadi aakhirkaar apane saathi ke ‘saundarya’ par hi lattu ho jaati hai
 Miss x could not find the prince of her dreams, but 67 per cent of the women surveyed claimed that they had found an 'ideal' sex partner ie husband (mix x says 'good')
 kareeb 42 fisadi hafte main teen baar sex karti hai, 38 fisadi ‘hameshaa’ yaa ‘zyaadaatar’ charam-sukh tak pahunchati hai or 52 fisadi ‘santusht’ mahasoos karti hai
 But Miss x says, "do they even know what satisfaction means?" For most, sex is a five-minute game and it starts with the lights off
 auraten har samay yahi baat karti rahati hai ki pati unhen daantate rahete hai, un par chillaate rahete hai yaa unka majaak udaate hai
 "is this changing picture of small cities a reality or a problem?" Interested sex is a man thing? Are women really enjoying themselves?

 The foundation stone of the country's first bullet train project was laid in Ahmedabad in Gujarat on Thursday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
 japan ke sahyog se modi bullate train ke sapane ko saakaar kar rahe hai
 After laying the foundation of the bullet train running between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, Modi said that India will get the bullet train for free
 unhone baqayada us ganit ko bhi samajhaayaa ki kaise bullate train ko bharat ko ek tarah se muft main bana rahaa he
 PM Modi said that we have got a friend like Japan who became helpful for the bullet train project
 unhone kaha ki log jab lone lene bainkon ke paas jate hai to bank unhen byaaj kii dar 6 yaa 7 fisadi bataata he
 Modi said that when you go to the market to buy something, in such a way, you calculate the money one by one
 koi ek bike bhi kharidta he to 10 bainkon ke chakkar katata he or agar koi bank aadha percent bhi byaaj dar main kam kar de to khushi hoti he
 People of Gujarat understand this very well
 modi ne kaha ki logon ko aise bank nahin milte, lekin hamen japan jaisaa desh mila he, jo hamen 88 hajaar karod rupee kaa lone or byaaj mahaj 0
 Is giving at the rate of 1 percent
 piem modi ne kaha ki japan jaisaa dost ho to phir kisi bhi project ko saakaar karnaa mumkin he
 Can you find a friend or bank who says that take a loan for free
 itnaa hi nahin agar koi ye kahe ki bina byaaj ke hi lone le lo or das-bees nahin, balki pachaas saal main chukaao, to aap yakeen karenge kya? japan ne jo lone die hai, use tunrat waapas bhi nahin karnaa, balki 15 saal ke baad waapas dene kii silsilaa shuru karnaa he
 Modi said that in this way we have a long time to pay the loan taken for Japan's bullet train and the interest rate is also very modest
 ye ek tarah kaa muft hi he, jisamen hamaare desh ko bina paise kii bullate train mil jaaegi
 Bullet train project will save the country's capital and will also increase foreign investment
 mumbai-ahmedabad hispid corndor se puure kshetra ko badhaava milegaa or rojgaar ke raste bhi khulenge
 Modi said that India is a country with a large population
 japan kii jitani aabaadi he, utane log bharat main har saptaah trainon kaa safar karte hai
 He said that we will try to complete the bullet train project in a short time
 hamaare paas scope he, japan ke paas skill he
 Skill development in collaboration with Japan will increase the strength of the country by thousands
 bharat or japan ne jo thaan liya he, usko puraa karke hi rahenge

 If you want to stay away from acne, you also have to stay away from stress
 galat beauty products kaa istemaal or munhasekuch saundarya prashaadhan yani cosmetics or clenzing utpaada bhi munhaason kii ek vajah ho sakate hai
 Therefore, avoid oily and such products, which can damage the skin

 aapke paseene main kai prakaar ke vishakt padaarth (toxins) tathaa kai gandagiyaan bhi hoti hai
 So keep in mind that you always have a small towel or handkerchief to wipe the sweat in your hand
 paseene se aapaki twachaa swatah hi saaf ho jaati he, lekin munhasein naa nikle, isliye samay-samay par paseene ko pochhna bhi jaruri he
 Keep the face clean, wash your face periodically with a gentle cleanser
 chehre par pani ke chhinton se twachaa main nai taazgi aati he or hydration kii vajah se munhaase va pimple dur rahete hai
 Include fruits and vegetables in your diet
 Eat more and more green vegetables and fruits
 is tarah kaa bhojan naa sirf aapaki sehat kaa khyaal rakhata he balki ye antioxident, vitamin or anya aavashyak poshak tatwon ke pramukh strot bhi hai, jo munhaason ke nishaan mitaane main madad karte hai or munhaason se grast twachaa ko thik bhi karte hai
 Try to drink as much water as possible in drinking water
 pani se sharir ke system main utpann hone vaale vishakt padaarth (toxins) tathaa gandagi khatm hoti he or aapaki twachaa bhi komal bani rahati he
 Avoid dull and dull lifestyle - Try to keep your body always active
 yoga tathaa vyaayaam se twachaa kii rangath badhati he or metabolizam bhi badhiya rahata he
 Wear comfortable clothes and wear loose clothes so as not to damage the skin
 garmi, gharshan tathaa tang topi aadi se hone vaale dabaav se bachane kaa prayaas karen
 Wear cotton clothes instead of synthetic jogging suits or yoga outfits
 vyaayaam ke baad sharir saaf rakhenvyaayaam ke baad snaan avashya karen, taaki pasinaa saaf ho jaae
 When you sweat after exercise, dead cells accumulate on your skin
 isliye jald se jald inhen hataanaa zaruri hota he
 If these dead cells remain on the skin, then the chances of acne are increased
 islieisse bachane ke liyaap naha lijie yaa ek rifreshing showers le lijie
 You will get benefit from these tips, but also keep in mind that there are many types of acne
 saath hi is baat kaa dhyaan bhi rakhana hoga ki umr or swasthya kaarnon (madhumeh aadi) kii vajah se bhi munhaase hote hai
 Therefore you need to be more alert
 munhaase kisi prakaar ke bhi hon, homeopathy iske ilaaj kaa sarvshereshth vikalp he

 pakistani pratinidhimandal main wing commander samet 10 adhikari shaamil rahe, jabaki bhartiya pratinidhimandal main paanch adhikari shaamil rahe
 Earlier, the sector commander level meeting between the two countries was held on 29 September 2017
 haal hi membharat-pakistanseema par hui baari golabari ke baad donon deshon ke suraksha balon ke bich yah pehali sector commander str kii baithak he
 During the recent shelling, Pakistan also tried to infiltrate into India, which was thwarted by the BSF
 biguef ne chaar janvari ko arniya sector main ghuspaith kii koshish kar rahe ek ghuspaithiya ko bhi dher kar diya tha
 During this sector commander level flag meeting, BSF expressed strong opposition to the shelling carried out by Nepakistan
 pakistan rangers ne teen janvari or 17 janvari ko biguef ke javaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya tha, jisamen do jawan shahid ho gaye the
 Apart from this, Pakistan Rangers are constantly targeting the residents of the border areas
 seemaa par biguef kii ore se munhtod jawaab milane ke chalate To bring the problems of their voters to the government of their own party, two BJP mlas of the state have had to hit the road
 ye hai purv mantri or vidhayak anup mishra or hatpiplya se vidhayak deepak joshi
 The Gwalior Municipal Corporation is controlled by the BJP
 swasthya mantri rah chuke anup mishra yahaan se vidhayak hai
 He along with his supporters reached the municipal office on 13 February
 nigam adhikariyon par unhone janata kii samasyaon kii ore dhyaan na dene kaa aarope lagaaya or sabhi adhikariyon ko jamkar kharikhoti sunai
 Mishra said that the authorities keep searching for ways to harass the public by sabotaging in the name of making the city beautiful
 iske baad unhone nagar nigam mukhyalay ke saamne hi jan chaoupal bhi lagaai or nagarikon se apni samasyaayein or shikaayatein bataane ke liye kaha
 There was uproar against the bjp-ruled corporation as the party's MLA came down
 bhaajapa ke liye sthiti us vakt or bhi pareshaani bhari ho gai jab party ke hi 20 parshadon sahit nigam sabhapati brijendra singh jadon ne bhi mishra kaa saath diya
 Not only this, many Congress leaders also came out in their support
 mishra ne aarope lagaaya ki sadaken chaudee karne ke liye atikaraman saal bhar pehle hataa die gaye the lekin chaudeekaran kaa kaam ab tak nahin hua
 Seeing the matter growing, State BJP President Prabhat Jha had to come to the field
 mishra ko manaane ke liye jha unke ghar gaye
 While handling the matter and trying to show unity in the party, he said that there is nothing wrong in this that Mishra has raised the public problems of his region
 mishra ke in tevar ko pradesh str par apni maujuudagi kaa ehsaas dilaane kaa tarika bhi mana ja saktaa he
 Actually, a year and a half ago, Mishra's family members came up in a murder case, due to which he had to resign from the cabinet
 haalanki baad main yah maamla thanda pad gaya or mishra ko mantri pad phir se hasil hone kii ummid bandhi, lekin aisa hua nahin
 When Mishra's message reached the government and the organization on the pretext of Jan Chaupal, he relented and said that his move was not against the government but against the attitude of the municipal officials
 gwalior main mishra ke tevar thande pade hi the ki bhaajapa ke diggaj netaa kailash joshi ke bete or vidhayak deepak joshi bhi apni aawaaj ko sarkaar tak pahunchane ke liye sadak par utar aae
 Deepak, an MLA from Hatpipalya in Dewas district, stopped the ballast filled dumpers passing through his area and alleged that the road which he had constructed from MLA fund is breaking due to these ballast filled dumpers of a company
 is kshetra main 6 len vaali sadak ke nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Due to road construction, the movement of dumpers has increased a lot
 joshi kaa aarope he ki danparon main manamaane tareeke se nirdhaarit seemaa se zyada maal ladaa hota he jisase sadakon ko nuksaan pahunchataa he
 People are not able to feel safe due to these dumpers
 joshi kehete hai, ''is babat prashasan se kai baar anurodh karne ke baavjood iskaa hal nikaalane kii ab tak koi koshish nahin hui
 Because of this, we have had to protest on the road
 '' joshi ne chetavanee di he ki 18 farvari tak unki samasya par dhyaan nahin diya gaya to unka aglaa kadam kshetra ke hive ko jam karnaa hoga
 Seeing the tough attitude of Joshi, the construction company has tried to find a middle ground
 gayatri constrections ne unhen bharosa diya he ki sadak ko jo bhi nuksaan pahunchaa he, use company khud hi thik karavaaegi
 We can hope that the public will get some benefit from these remarks of mlas

 The Pay Commission had recommended to the Central Government in its report that there is a general feeling that over time promotions and increments happen automatically

 Their performance is not as expected

 team india ke captain kool mahendra singh dhoni ne guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahe england ke khilaaf pehle test match main teen spin gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii sambhaavna ko buudhvaar ko puri tarah khaarij kar diya
 This means that r Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha can be fed in the playing XI by keeping senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh out of the playing XI
 harbhajan ne ek saal se bhi zyada samay baad team main vaapasi kii he
 Dhoni said, "if we get the wicket that we got against South Africa in 2008 in Kanpur, then we could have played with four spinners
 hamen yah bhi dekhne kii jarurat he ki hamen aisa wicket mil rahaa he jis par tej gendbaajon ko bhi thodi reverse swing mil rahi he
 It is always advisable to have a bowling attack that varies
 ’dhoni ne yah bhi suchit kiya ki tej gendbaaj ishanth sharma pehle test main nahin khelenge kyonki vah abhi tak viral bukhaar se nahin ubre hai jabaki anya tej gendbaaj jahir khan or umesh yadav team ke liye uplabdh the, jinhone buudhvaar ko team ke saath abhyaas nahin kiya
 Dhoni said, 'ishant is viral and he is not fully recovered
 anya khilaadi uplabdh hai
 'ashok Dinda has been called as standby in place of Sharma, Dhoni said that the team took some extra caution
 unhone kaha, ‘vah sirf ‘back-ap’ he
 If someone is injured at night or in the morning, he can come into the team
 ’ jahir or yadav ke aaj abhyaas main anupasthit hone ke bare main bataate hue dhoni ne kaha ki yah team kii yojana ke anusaar hi hua tha kyonki ve mumbai or yahaan pichley kuch dinon main lambey abhyaas satr ke baad in donon tej gendbaajon ko aaraam dena chaahate the
 Dhoni said, 'this was our plan
 hamane mumbai main nau se 11 november tak lanbaa abhyaas kiya tha or pichley kuch dinon main yahaan abhyaas kiya he
 These were long sessions for him
 hamane kaha ki unhen aaraam dena acha rahegaa
 He refused to say anything in the controversy whether it was a series of revenge for the team as India got 0 in England last year
 4 se whitewash kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 Dhoni said, 'I only know that if we go to the ground, there will be a red ball and two teams will play
 aap jise chaahate ho, uskaa naam de sakate ho
 He also denied breaking the opening pair of Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag, while the Delhi pair could not perform well in the last home series against New Zealand and the series in Australia
 dhoni ne atakalon kaa daur samaapt karte hue kaha, ‘gautam or viru pari kaa aagaaj karenge
 He praised two frontline spin bowlers Ashwin and Ojha, saying, "ashwin and Ojha understand each other very well, which is very important
" ojha ek chor par ran gati par lagaam kasata he or aswin hameshaa adhik aakraamak rahata he jisamen kaaphi vibhinnata he or vah inkaa istemaal karnaa pasand karata he
 Talking about Harbhajan's role, Dhoni said that this Punjab off-spinner is very experienced from which both these young spinners can benefit

 On one hand, their old team is Australia and on the other their new team is New Zealand
 ji haa, luk ronchi iklaute aise cricketer hai, jinhone australia or newzealand donon kii ore se international cricket main hissaa liya he
 Ronchi was born in Denevirke, New Zealand, but moved to Western Australia with his family at the age of 6
 jaldi hi vahaan ke gharelu cricket main unki pahchaan ban gai
 He came to be called 'the future of Gilchrist'
 wicketcaping ke saath-saath tufaani andaaz main ballebaazi karne vaale ronchi ko 2008 main australia kii ore se vanade match main debyue karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 In the second ODI, Ronchi scored a half-century with just 22 balls
 lekin ronchi ko aage chalakar australia kii ore se keval 4 vanade or teen tii-20 match khilne kaa mauka mila
 With the presence of Brad Haddin, Ronchi realized that he could hardly get a chance to play for Australia
 ve 2012 main newzealand laut gaye or 2013 ke aate-aate newzealand kii team main shaamil ho gaye
 In January 2015, he played a stormy innings of 170 runs against Sri Lanka in just 99 balls
 isi world cap semifinal main unke saathi khilaadi grant iliet ne apane mul desh dakshin africa ko baahar karne kaa karnama dikhaaya he, aise main luk ronchi ke saamne bhi dharm sankat to hoga
 But Luke Ronchi's mother, Maggie Ronchi, said before the final match that her son was a Kiwi

 He also alleged that his voice has been tampered with in the video
 AFWA apane str par ye daawa nahin kar saktaa ki viral ho rahaa ye video kab kaa he
 We did not find any evidence to suggest that the video has been tampered with or any separate sound has been inserted in it

 From the conversation happening in the video, it seems that the man who is introducing Tej Bahadur in a loud voice, is drunk
 video main unhen dilli police (DP), punjab police (PP) ke sankshipt naamon kaa majaak udaate hue suna ja saktaa he
 It is difficult to find out from the viral video that the other man is Tej Bahadur

 We were not considering the Indian team a challenge before the final

 In 1992, we played the tri-series, played the test series, followed by the World Cup, is something similar happening this time? Mindset is the most important

 Today the World Cup is huge and only those who play well in those 20 days will win

 In such a situation, i feel that Missbah should be retained as captain

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh holds the position of number two in the government, but recently he has not done any of the important decisions that the government has taken from his ministry
 north block main jahaan grih mantralay he, vahiin kai afasar is baat kii tasdik karte hai
 The latest example is that of Home Secretary LC Goyal
 afasaron kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jis tarah se faisla liya or vitt mantralay se ek sachiv ko laakar grih sachiv bana diya, usamen rajnath singh se poocha tak nahin gaya
 Now Rajnath Singh is said to be angry
 jab nae grih sachiv rajeev maharishi ne aakar apana kaarybhaar sambhala tab grahamantri apane daftar se nadaarad the
 By the way, whenever a major incident or decision is taken, the Home Minister is found missing
 ab aap bharat or pakistan ke bich neshnal security adwiser ke bich baatcheet ko hi le lijie, puraa kaa puraa jimmaa enese ne uthaaya hua tha, jo bhi dogier taiyaar kiye ja rahe the, beshak se usamen grih mantralay or ibi ke afasar shaamil the, lekin baat sirf dobhaal kii ho rahi thi
 Whether or not the talks would take place was not decided, but the Home Minister left for a tour of his area
 jab baatcheet cancil hui tab videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne aakar baat sanbhali
 The Home Minister was nowhere to be seen or heard in this entire controversy, while the Ministry of Home Affairs did everything related to the conversation
 chaahe vah aatank se judaa masalaa ho, daaud ibrahim se judaa yaa phir border firing se, lekin puure maamle main grahamantralay ko said line kiya gaya
 Even when the Naga Accord was held, the Ministry of Home Affairs kept the PMO away from the entire matter while the Home Ministry has a North East Desk
 khud grih rajyamantri ne jis din ecord par dastakhat hue us din apni press conference kaarij kar di kyonki unhen maaloom tha log sirf ecord ke bare main puuchhenge or ecord ke bare main kisi ko kuch pataa nahin tha
 The corridors of the Home Ministry are hot anyway because the PMO appoints most of the officers, only the copy of the order is sent to the Home Ministry
 vaise is baat par bhi bahes afasaron main aam hoti ja rahi he ki grahamantri kaam kaaj main zyada dhyaan nahin de rahe hai sirf khanaapurti kar rahe hai unka sara dhyaan party main laga rahata he
 The comments kabhi har chote bade faisle is mantralay se yaa to hote the yaa kahin na kahin un faislon main mantralay kaa role hota tha
 Now both are not
 ek ke baad ek vivaad grih mantralay se jud rahaa he or aisa aarope lag rahaa he ki desh ke grahamantri unamem se kisi ek vivaad ko bhi sulajhaa nahin paa rahe hai or na hi mantralay thik dhang se chalaa paa rahe hai
 On the other hand, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have made their position in the party such that when there is a problem, they are led by the government, while the leader of government number two is always missing in times of trouble
 sabase taaja misaal he grih sachiv elsi goyal kii
 Officials say that Rajnath Singh was not even asked in the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the decision and brought a secretary from the Finance Ministry to the Home Secretary
 ab rajnath singh khafa bataae ja rahe hai
 The Home Minister was absent from his office when the new Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi came and took charge
 vaise jab bhi koi badi ghatana yaa faisla liya jaataa he us vaqt grahamantri nadaarad paae jate hai
 Now take the conversation between India and Pakistan between the National Security Advisor, the entire responsibility was taken up by the NSA, whatever dossiers were being prepared, of course it included the Ministry of Home Affairs and IB officials, but It was only about Doval
 baatcheet hogi yaa nahin hogi ye tay nahin hua tha, lekin grahamantri apane ilaake ke daure ke liye chale gaye the
 When the talks were canceled, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj came and handled the matter
 is puure vivaad main grahamantri kahin na dikhe, na sunai pade jabaki baatcheet se judaa har kaam grih mantralay ne kiya tha
 Whether it was a terror issue, Dawood Ibrahim or border firing, the entire ministry was side-lined
 jab naga ecord hua, tab bhi grih mantralay ko piemo ne puure maamle se dur rakhaa jabaki grih mantralay main ek north east desk he
 The Minister of State for Home Affairs himself dismissed his press conference the day the Accord was signed because he knew people would only ask about the Accord and no one knew anything about the Accord
 grih mantralay ke galiyare vaise bhi is baat se garm hai ki zyaadaatar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan piemo karata he sirf order kii copy grih mantralay ko bhej di jaati he
 By the way, the debate is also becoming common in the officers that the Home Minister is not paying much attention to the work, he is only doing the Khanapurti, his entire focus is on the party
 tippaniyan Every small and big decision was made either from this ministry or somewhere, the role of the ministry was in those decisions
 ab donon nahin he
 One dispute after another is being connected with the Ministry of Home Affairs and it is being alleged that the Home Minister of India is not able to resolve any of these disputes nor is the Ministry running properly
 udhar, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne or vittamantri arun jetali ne apni pojishan party main aisi kar lee he ki jab koi samasya hoti he to unhen sarkaar aage karti he jabaki sarkaar ke number do ke netaa hameshaa musiibat ke samay gaayab rahete hai

 When the talks were canceled, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj came and handled the matter
 is puure vivaad main grahamantri kahin na dikhe, na sunai pade jabaki baatcheet se judaa har kaam grih mantralay ne kiya tha
 Whether it was a terror issue, Dawood Ibrahim or border firing, the entire ministry was side-lined
 jab naga ecord hua, tab bhi grih mantralay ko piemo ne puure maamle se dur rakhaa jabaki grih mantralay main ek north east desk he
 The Minister of State for Home Affairs himself dismissed his press conference the day the Accord was signed because he knew people would only ask about the Accord and no one knew anything about the Accord
 grih mantralay ke galiyare vaise bhi is baat se garm hai ki zyaadaatar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan piemo karata he sirf order kii copy grih mantralay ko bhej di jaati he
 By the way, the debate is also becoming common in the officers that the Home Minister is not paying much attention to the work, he is only doing the Khanapurti, his entire focus is on the party
 tippaniyan Every small and big decision was made either from this ministry or somewhere, the role of the ministry was in those decisions

 Even when the Naga Accord was held, the Ministry of Home Affairs kept the PMO away from the entire matter while the Home Ministry has a North East Desk
 khud grih rajyamantri ne jis din ecord par dastakhat hue us din apni press conference kaarij kar di kyonki unhen maaloom tha log sirf ecord ke bare main puuchhenge or ecord ke bare main kisi ko kuch pataa nahin tha
 The corridors of the Home Ministry are hot anyway because the PMO appoints most of the officers, only the copy of the order is sent to the Home Ministry
 vaise is baat par bhi bahes afasaron main aam hoti ja rahi he ki grahamantri kaam kaaj main zyada dhyaan nahin de rahe hai sirf khanaapurti kar rahe hai unka sara dhyaan party main laga rahata he

 None of the speeches that Narendra Modi has given since becoming Prime Minister in 2014, have been appreciated all the way around which he made in the bjp-led NDA in the Central Hall of Parliament on Saturday
 Had given before the newly elected mps
 is bhaashan se sanket mili ki vah pradhanmantri ke rup main apane duusare kaarykaal kii vaastaviktaa, vaagdhara or chhavi ko badalanaa chaahate hai
 The difference between Pracharak Modi and Captain Modi was seen by fans as well as critics
 aakhir vah sansadeey chunaav ke itihaas main sabase zyaada dhruvikrut abhiyaan kaa netritv kar yahaan tak pahunche hai
 But now, after getting a new better mandate, Modi, who is going to take oath as Prime Minister of India once again on Thursday, adopted a completely new and such style which was clearly contrary to polarization
 unka bhaashan kai pahaluon se vastav main prashansaneey tha - or sabase zyaada bhartiya musalamaanon kii ore unki pahunch banane kii koshish kii vajah se
 What he said on this issue - and more importantly - whether his actions will match his words or not, will determine how history will look at Modi's legacy
 muslimon ko die unke sandesh main do baaten dhyaan rakhane laayak thim
 First, he emphasized the need to win the trust of Muslims
 unhone kaha, "is desh main votbank kii raajnneeti ke uddeshy se banaae kaalpanik dar ke zariye alpsankhyakon ko dhokhaa diya jaataa rahaa he
 
 
 We have to break this trick
 
 
 hamen vishwaas jeetna he
 
 
 "secondly, he also talked about piercing the thinking and prejudice deep within his own ideological fraternity - it is said, Muslims are not 'we', 'others'
" unhone kaha, "ab hamaara koi paraayaa nahin ho saktaa he
 
 
 Those who vote for us also belong to us
 
 
 jo hamaara ghor virodh karte hai, ve bhi hamaare hai
 
 
 "why Modi has made this new and unmatched character reach towards Muslims
 
 
 ? or isi vakt kyon
 
 
 The The second question can be easily answered
 ab jab unhen pehle se bada or zyaada asardaar janadesh hasil hua he, jo lagbhag puri tarah modi ke liye tha, BJP ke liye nahin, to vah is baat ke prati zyaada vishwaas se bhare hai ki party or sarkaar ko us disha main le ja sakenge, jahaan vah chaahate hai
 He does not feel strongly bound by the Sangh Parivar in this context
 ab sangh parivaar ko unki disha ko sweekaar karnaa hoga, unhen sangh parivaar kii nahin
 It is worth remembering here that even after being Chief Minister of Gujarat for three terms, he had completely overcome the very powerful Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other RSS organizations in the state
 ab pehle sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye hamen modi ke saamne videsh niti tathaa gharelu nitiyon ke morche par maujuud baadhyataaon tathaa avasaron kii ore dekhnaa hoga
 The domestic constraint is that the expectations of the voters are skyrocketing, so they have to live up to the expectations - especially on the economic front
 arthvyavastha kii haalat acchhee nahin he
 The demand for employment is high, and all-round
 krishi kshetra kii dikkatein jyon kii tyon bani hui hai
 And even though inflation did not become an issue in this election, the fears of the rise in oil prices (due to the increasing tension between the US and Iran) will only increase the problems of the common man
 aisa halaat main modi gharelu morche par aman kii zarurat ko samajhate hai, jise unke hi samarthakon main maujuud kattarpanthi khatm kar sakate hai, or muslimon ko asurakshit mahasoos karne par majaboor kar degi
 His words - now we cannot have any alien - were explicitly uttered for the same people
 modi ne apane naare 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' main 'sabakaa vishwaas' ko jodakar apane liye ek or baadhyataa paidaa kar lee he
 It is clear as day that neither Modi has won the trust of about 20 crore Indian Muslims so far, nor has his party been able to do so
 'samaveshi bharat' ke liye 'samaveshi vikaas' kaa unka nayaa naaraa katai khokhla rah jayega, agar desh kaa doosraa sabase bada dharmik samudaay khud ko sattapaksh kii ore se kataa-kataa mahasoos karata rahaa
 In his victory speech delivered at the BJP headquarters on 23 May, Modi had rightly said that even though the elections are won on the principle of 'majority', the government can be run only if the country can move only when 'consensus' The principle should be followed
 lekin kya yah 'sarvamat' kii baat 'jumala' banakar nahin rah jaaegi, agar muslimon kii awaz nahin suni gai, or agar satta se jude sansthaanon main muslimon ko uchit pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya
 
 
 The Modi is already facing sharp questions on this issue
 kyon nai loksabhaa main BJP ke 303 saansadon main ek bhi muslim nahin he
 
 
 The The situation remained the same, so how can BJP be called a real national party
 
 
 ? haa, bhugaulik drushti se samooche bharat main party kii pahunch ban gai he, lekin kya isaki saamaajik pahunch rashtriya he
 
 
 ? In terms of foreign policy, even then Modi will have to take Indian Muslims along
 unki koshishon se bhi, or duniya ke badalte halaat kii vajah se bhi - kuch ahm muslim mulkon - khaastaur se saudi arab or sanyukt arab emirate (UAE) - se bharat ke rishte haalia saalon main majboot hue hai
 After the terrorist attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama, these two countries played an important role in reducing the tension between India and Pakistan
 UAE ne to bharat main chunavi prakriya shuru ho jane ke baad modi ko sarvocch naagarik sammaan die jane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 India's close relations with Muslim countries would be blurred if communal divisions within India continue to emerge in a violent form
 yah bhi lagbhag nishchit he ki bharat-pakistan ke bich rishton ko saamaanya karne ke liye modi ab imran khan se bahut-se muddon par baatcheet shuru karenge
 i have heard that they have also started lines of communication from military bases in Islamabad
 mujhe puri ummid he ki nae janadesh se mili is maukey se peeche nahin hatenge, or iskaa istemaal vah uplabdhi hasil karne main karenge, jo nihsandeh bharat kii videsh niti ke liye sabase ahm chunauti rahi he
 However, in order to carry out this difficult task, Modi must first show that he has not only acquired the 'faith' of the Hindus, but also the 'faith' of the Muslims of India
 haa, modi kii muslimon tak banaai ja rahi is pahunch kaa swaagat sabhi ko karnaa chahie, kyonki isse bharat kaa loktantr, vikaas or rashtriya akhandta majboot ho sakati he
 However, he and his party will make a mistake if they believe that the trust of Muslims can be won just by talking - or just by bashing secular parties to instill fear among Muslims
 sach he, bjp-virdohi partiyaan kuch had tak iske liye doshi hai, or unhone chunavi phaaydon ke liye 'muslim votbank' kaa istemaal kiya he, lekin kya modi or BJP ne bhi muslimon main chautarafa faile dar, unke bheetar maujuud takat se dur rakhe jane kii bhaavana, bahari samajhe jane kii bhaavana or yahaan tak ki dabaae gaye gusse ko badhaane main yogadan nahin diya he
 
 
 Therefore, if Modi is really serious about starting his new innings with everyone, he will have to introspect on many issues
 unhen BJP or sangh parivaar ko bhi unheen kii line par chalane ke liye baadhya karnaa hoga
 They will have to go ahead and invite effective and respected representatives of the Muslim community for regular talks, which include their staunch critics, and they will also have to share at various levels of strength in India's democratic structure
 shiksha, rojgaar or civil sevaaon va sainya sevaaon main samaan avasaron ke maamle main muslimon kii bhagidaari kam (sachhar cameti kii report main saamne ai kadavi sachai) hone ke liye sirf congress or anya partiyon ko doshi qaraar dene kii jagah modi ko thos niti or aise kadam uthaakar dikhaane honge, jinase sabit ho sake ki vah muslimon kii tarakkee ke liye katibaddh hai
 In this context, i would like to suggest that he read a brilliant new book on this subject - Denial and Deprivation: Indian Muslims After the Sachar Committee and Ranganath Mishra Commission Reports - which i recently released in Mumbai, and this The book is written by Abdur Rahman, an IPS officer serving in Maharashtra
 ant main, main kahana chaahunga, pradhanmantri narendra modi ji, main NDA kii baithak main die gaye ummid jagaane vaale aapke bhaashan kii puure dil se saraahna karata hum
 Now let me urge you along with crores of patriotic Indians (non-muslims too, Muslims too) - follow what you said

 vaise pradhanmantri ke saath 19 disambar ko hui baithak kii soshal media par is baat ko lekar aalochana hui thi ki panel main koi bhi mahila pratinidhi nahin thi
 After this, Alia and Bhumi were included in the panel
 panel main koi mahila shaamil naa karne ko lekar abhinayta-produsar ajay devgan, akshay kumaar, karan johar, siddharth raay kapur, ritesh siddhvani or anya kii jamkar aalochana kii thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a big announcement about the Army on Independence Day
 unhone teenon senaaon ke bich samanvay or prabhavi netritv ke liye chif of dephence staff kaa nayaa pad banane kii baat kahi
 PM Modi said that there has been a long discussion on improving the military system, military power and military resources in our country
 kai kamishnon kii report main kaha gaya he ki hamaari teenon senaaon jal, thal, nabh ke bich samanvay to he, lekin aaj jaise duniya badal rahi he aise main bharat ko tukdon main sochane se nahin chalegaa
 PM Modi said that our entire military power will have to work on lump sum, moving forward together
 ab ham chif of dephence staff yani sidies kii vyavastha karenge
 Although the demand for Chief of Defense arose in the country after the 1999 Kargil War, but retired Army Brigade and Defense Expert Gurmeet Kanwal has been raising this issue since 1996
 unhone 2013 main institute for dephence studies and analysis(idsa) ke liye likhe ek lekh main is pad kii jarurat ke peeche kai tark die the
 In his article written on 12 December 2013, Gurbit Kavalak says that success in modern-day war depends on joint military policy and unified landing on the ground
 chif of dephence staff kii niyukti se yuddh aadi sankatkalin sthitiyon main nirnaayak faisla lene, prayek vikalp ko aage badhaane ke phaayde or nuksaan ke saath sabhi tarah ke halaat kaa vishleshan karne main madad milegi
 The Chief of Defense can resolve the differences
 adarsh sthiti main sidies ek samgr commander in chif hona chahie
 Given India's vast terrain, long borders and coastlines, CDS is essential for managing external and internal security challenges
 kyon safal nahin he COAC systemritred brigadier gurmeet kanwal ne britain ke purv pradhanmantri winston churchill ke mashhoor kathan kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha-committees cannot fight wars(cametiyaan yuddh nahin lard sakati hai)
 Winston Churchill was the one who turned Britain's definitive defeat in the Second World War into a victory with its swift decisions
 gurmeet kanwal ke mutabik desh main chif of stoff cameti(coac) kaa prayog safal nahin rahaa he
 Because it is not an executive authority
 yah teenon senaaon ko lekar kathor nirnay lene kii sthiti main bhi nahin he
 It mainly works by consensus
 chunki antim lakshya sabake liye samaan hote hai, vahaan pahunchane ke liye hameshaa maarg chunane par asahmati hoti he
 Such complex military operations during the war, professional understanding is required during the bilateral approach
 brigadier gurmeet kanwal ke mutabik aksar yuddh ke dauraan puure abhiyaan kaa bhagya kisi ek nirnay par tikaa hota he
 This decision can only be made by a specially selected defense chief and not by a committee like COSC
 itihaas aise udaahranon se bharaa padaa he, jab ek nirnay ne yuddh kaa rasta badal diya
 Many major countries of the world have adopted this system
 bharat ise andekha nahin kar saktaa
 Now the time has come to adopt this system
 brigadier gurmeet kanwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se laal kile kii pracheer se chif of dephence stoff kii niyukti ke elaan ke baad twit kiya- Finally
 
 
 I've been writing about CDS since 1996 (after all

 After presenting the report of the Kargil Review Committee in the year 2000, a committee of ministers (GOM) headed by the then Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani and one headed by Arun Singh The task force was formed
 teenon senaaon ke sanghathanaatmak dhaanche kii samiksha ke baad samiti ne kai siforishein kin thim
 There was also talk of creating the post of Chief of Defense
 haalanki, varsh 2000 main hi teenon senaaon main samanvay ke liye headquarters integrated dephence staff((hq IDS) kaa gathan kiya gaya
 It is headed by a Three Star Officer, who reports to the Chief of Staff Committee
 haalanki 2012 main ritred beurocret naresh chandra cameti ne raksha sudhaaron se judi ek report pesh kii thi
 In which he recommended the permanent appointment of Four Star Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman in place of Five Star Chief of Defense Staff
 haalanki yah prastaav raksha mantralay main lambit rahaa tha
 Now, by appointing the Chief of Defense Staff, the Modi government has implemented the recommendations of the Kargil War Committee and the Group of Ministers headed by Advani
