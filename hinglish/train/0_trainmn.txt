 But you didn't listen vidaa kehane nahin ja jaaoongaa

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar took a dig at the Modi government for farmer movements and said that farmers are not getting fair price
 unhone kaha ki kisaanon kii upaj ke liye aparyaapt or kam kharid mulya vartmaan krishi sankat kaa aadhaar he
 Nitish said that debt waiver is not a solution to the problem of farmers and agriculture sector
 jab tak kisaanon ko unki laagat kaa 50 pratishat munafa jodakar fasalon kaa nunatam samarthan mulya tay nahin kiya jaataa he, tab unki samasya kaa sthaayee hal nahin ho sakaa he
 Talking to reporters after his 'jan Samvad' program on Monday, Nitish gave his first reaction to the performance of farmers in Madhya Pradesh and other parts of the country
 unhone saaf taur par kaha ki karj lene vaale or karj na lene vaale donon tarah ke kisaanon kii asli samasya unki fasalon kaa sahi mulya na mil paanaa he
 Nitish demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take the initiative on this issue and said that PM Modi should fulfill the promises made by him and in his party's (BJP) manifesto before the election
 nitish ne kaha ki puure desh main krishi kshetra main sankat jari he
 The cost of crops has risen and farmers are in crisis
 karj maafee ek mudda he, lekin yah kisaanon kii sabhi samasyaon kaa hal nahin he
 The real problem is that the farmers are not getting the right price as per the cost
 tippaniyan The Bihar Chief Minister said that Modi had promised before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and it was also included in the bjp's manifesto, according to which farmers should be given a minimum support price by adding 50 per cent profit above their cost price
 kisaanon kii samasyaon kaa isi se nidaan nikal saktaa he
 Nitish said that crop insurance scheme is not effective for farmers
 bihar kaa aankada dekh lijie ki muaavje ke rup main kitne kaa bhugtan kiya he
 Publicity is not going to happen
 karj maafee honi chahie, lekin yah bhi tathy he ki jin kisaanon ne karj nahin liya, wo bhi sankat main hai
 On whether his government will take any initiative to pardon the loans of farmers in Bihar, Nitish said that there is no tendency for farmers to take loans here
 nitish ne kaha ki jo bhi kheti kaa kaam karata he, wo sab kisaan hai
 To increase farmers' income, the Center will have to take initiative
 sirf krishi mantralay kaa naam badal dene se kisaanon kaa kalyaan nahin ho paaegaa
 Nitish also lashed out at Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh
 radhamohan singh pichley saptaah apane sansadeey kshetra motihaari main ek yoga shivi main bhaag le rahe the
 Nitish said that seeing pictures of him doing yoga made me laugh, at least i should do yoga posture properly
 somvaar ko apane 'jan samvaad' kaarykram ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue nitish ne madhya pradesh or desh ke anya hisson main kisaanon ke pradarshan par pehali baar apni pratikriya di
 He clearly stated that the real problem of both the borrower and the non-borrower farmers is not getting the right price for their crops
 nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se is mudde par pahal karne kii maang kii ki or kaha ki piem modi ko chunaav purv apane dwaara or apni party (bijepi) ke ghoshnaa patr main kiye gaye vaadon ko puraa karnaa chahie
 Nitish said that the crisis in the agricultural sector is continuing throughout the country
 fasalon kii laagat badi he or kisaan sankat main hai
 Debt waiver is an issue, but it is not the solution to all the problems of farmers
 asli samasya yah he ki kisaanon ko laagat ke anusaar vaazib keemat nahin mil rahi he
 The comments bihar ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle vaada kiya tha or ise bijepi ke ghoshnaa patr main bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha, uske anusaar kisaanon ko unke laagat mulya ke upar 50 fisadi munafa jodakar nunatam samarthan mulya diya jaae
 Problems of farmers can be diagnosed from this only
 nitish ne kaha ki fasal beemaa yojana kisaanon ke liye kargar nahin he
 Look at the figure of Bihar, how much has been paid as compensation
 keval prachaar-prasar se nahin chalane vaala he
 There should be a loan waiver, but it is also a fact that the farmers who have not taken loans are also in crisis
 bihar main kya kisaanon kii karj maafi ke liye unki sarkaar koi pahal karegi, is par nitish ne kaha ki yahaan kisaanon main karj lene kii pravriti nahin he
 Nitish said that whoever does the work of farming, they are all farmers
 kisaanon kii aamadani bade, iske liye centre ko pahal karnaa hoga
 Only by changing the name of the Ministry of Agriculture will not be the welfare of the farmers
 nitish ne kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh par bhi jamkar chutki lee

 Speaking to Aaj Tak, he said that if there is a possibility of causing confusion or concern about Bangladesh on CAA, then it will be a matter of concern for us
 choudhary ne kaha, bharat or bangladesh ke bich ek behad sauhardpurn sambandh hai or yah 1971 ke libration yuddh se upja he
 He said, 'your (indian) soldiers put their lives at stake for our freedom struggle
 yah anokhaa tha, yah itihaas he
 You gave shelter to 10 million Bangladeshis, who were persecuted by the Pakistani army
 ab, ham rohingya sharnaarthiyon ko bhi aashray dete hai
 'india should not consider Bangladesh as Pakistan and Afghanistan,' he said, 'india is no longer only our friend, but a friend of all time
 yadi koi gharelu mudda bangladesh main chintaa paidaa kar saktaa he to hamaare paas ashankit hone ke kaaran hai
 'chaudhary said that we do not connect Bangladesh with Pakistan and Afghanistan, which are known for fundamentalism and terrorism
 unhone kaha, 'hamaari pradhanmantri shaikh hasina ne hameshaa kaha he ki hamaari dharti ko bharat ke khilaaf istemaal karne kii anumati nahin di jaaegi
 'excluding a community, leaving a community alone with the citizenship law against the Indian Constitution, he said,' i will not comment in any way on the decisions of those who have made the law
 lekin yah kanoon na keval bharatiyon main balki baahar bhi ek chintaa kaa vishay bana hua he ki bharat apni dharmanirpeksh chhavi ke liye janaa jaataa he or iske liye hameshaa khadaa rahaa he

 'the migration of minorities to India is not due to persecution, the Home Minister of India Amit Shah commended Sheikh Hasina and at the same time said that there was also persecution under her government
 is baat par hasina ke media salaahkaar choudhary ne kaha ki ham bharat main alpsankhyakon ke daakhil hone ko lekar inkaar nahin karenge, lekin yah pravaas kai kaarnon se he
 One is due to oppression and the other to a better future
 unhone kaha, 'utpeedan ke kaaran koi alpsankhyak bharat nahin gaya
 It is not based on the fact that minorities went there due to persecution

 pradhanmantri modi ne hamaare pradhanmantri or bharat ke grih mantri ne hamaare grih mantri ko aashwaasan diya ki chintit mahasoos karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he

 Ashutosh Gowariker's film Panipat is not taking the name of trouble lessening
 film ko desh ke kai rajya main virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Most of the opposition is being seen in Rajasthan
 rajasthan main film ke khilaaf ye virodh pradarshan ab hinsak ho chalaa he
 Reports of sabotage came to light from several cinemas in Rajasthan on Monday
 kai jagahon par shishe tode gaye to kai jagahon par haul ke baahar taale lataka die gaye
 Apart from this, Bharatpur was seen closed due to the film
 film main kirdaaron ke saathchhedchhad kaa aaropabata den,panipatake khilaaf logon kaa gussa isliye phunta he kyonki aisa aarope lag rahaa he ki film main itihaas ke saath chhedakani karne kii koshish kii gai he
 The film incorrectly depicts the image of Maharaja Surajmal
 khud ko maharaja surajmal kaa vanshaj bataane vaale rajasthan sarkaar main mantri vishvendra singh ne kadi aapatti darj karwaai he
 His belief is that history has been tampered with while making Panipat
 film ke diarector or nirmaataa ne sasti lokapriyata paane ke liye ye sab kiya he
 Earlier all this was seen in Jodha Akbar also
 aise hi padmavati kaa naam badalakar padmavat karnaa padaa tha, jab rajya main hinsa bhadak gai thi
 Now it seems that something similar has been done with Panipat
 bina itihaas ko thik se padhe film main galat chijen dikhaai gai hai
 Vishvendra Singh has expressed his displeasure over one more thing
 unki maane to marathaon kii madad karne ke liye maharaja surajmal ne kabhi bhi agra fort kii maang nahin kii thi
 The demand for banning the film is now difficult to tell the truth and how much lies in the film, but Maharaj Surajmal's vahanj has intensified the demand to ban the film
 unhone twit kar panipat ko bain karne kii baat kahi he
 If it is not so, law and order can also deteriorate
 In light of the vociferous protest by the Jat community in Haryana, Rajasthan and other regions of North India, i believe that the film should be banned to avoid a law and order situation
 @ ashokgehlot51 @ vasundharabjp @ sachinpilot @ katarialalchand @ satishpooniabjp @ barmer_harish — Vishvendra Singh (@vishvendrabtp) December 8, 2019 Please tell, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot has also advocated the intervention of the censor board in the case
 wo kehete hai 'panipat ko lekar aisa virodh nahi hona chahie tha
 The censor board should immediately intervene in the case
 film se jude logon ko bhi jat samudaay se baat kar maamle ko shant karne kii koshish kerani chahie
 'now Gehlot did not stop here, he has also raised his voice against Panipat in gestures
 gahalot kehete hai 'meri najaron main ek film kaa sammaan hona chahie
 The actors working in the film should also be respected
 lekin kabhi bhi kisi jati yaa dharm ko yaa usase jude logon ko apamaanit nahin karnaa chahie
 There is a plan to drag the film Panipat to the court

 Today the whole world is celebrating Anti Child Labor Day in protest against child labor
 is diwas kii shuruyaat saal 2002 main 14 saal se kam umr ke bacchon ko bal mazdooree se nikaalkar shiksha dilaane ke uddeshy se 'da international lebar organijeshan' ne kii thi
 However, even after 17 years, children are finding it difficult to control child labor in India
 bharat main bal shram ko lekar spasht aankade uplabdh nahin hai
 But, according to the 2011 census, more than 10 million children in the age group of 5-14 in India have been pushed into the quagmire of child labor
 antarrashtriya shram sanghathan kii ek report ke mutabik puri duniya main lagbhag 15
 2 crore children are forced into child labor
 bharat main mazdooree karne vaale bacchon main ek badi taadaad gramin ilaakon se taalluk rakhti he
 According to statistics, about 80 percent of child labor has its roots in rural areas
 desh main 2011 ke aadhaar par sector aadhaarit bal mazdooree par najar daali jaae to bacchon kii sabase badi aabaadi yani 32
 9 percent (33 lakh) is engaged in agriculture related work, while 26 percent (26)

 Uttar Pradesh, Bihar has the highest number of child laborers - India has the highest number of child laborers in 5 states, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh

 During the Parliament session, Rahul Gandhi, who was called 'non-serious' among the opponents due to his holidays, came back, and the 'angry Youngman' style of wearing sleeves was missing
 kisaan-majdoor-garib kii samasyaon ke saath modi sarkaar pararajanatik tippanee kaa andaazbhi alag tha
 Perhaps it was not for the warlords of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so they missed the opportunity to surround Rahul on holiday
 rahul ne uskaa phayda uthaate hue bajet satr ke duusare hisse mendhardaar tareekon se mudde utaneshuru kar die
 Pressure strategy: Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of farmers' plight, delay in grain procurement, net neutrality associated with youth and closure of food parks in his parliamentary constituency Amethi
 sansad ke baahar bhi real estate bill se lekar kisaanon kii aatmahatya jaise mudde uthaae
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi also raised the issue of delay in appointment to Lokpal, Information Commission
 congress kii dabaav kii ranneeti kaam bhi ai or real estate bill ko rajyasabha main select cameti ko bhejnaa padaa to bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko sarkaar thande baste main daalati dikh rahi he
 How upset the government is with the bjp's taunt in exchange for the defensive, it can be gauged that three to four ministers used to stand in the House to answer
 kisaanon ke mudde par krishi mantri radhamohan singh ne tathyaatmak jawaab diya jisaki khud modi ne baad main tarif kii, lekin ve rahul korajanatik rup se mathanhin de paae
 Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also avoided personal comments on net neutrality
 to sadak or parivahan mantri nitin gadakari teen din baad sadan main likhit spashtikaran ke saath aane ko majaboor hue
 On the other hand, a section of the BJP is in favor that the party should also respond in the same language as Rahul is making personal comments on the Modi government
 congress yukt bharat kii ranneetipradhanmantri modi ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehlecongress mukt bharat kaa naaraadia tha
 But the way politics has taken a turn within a year, BJP strategists have started to feel that it is beneficial for the party to stay in the Congress
 bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa or chunaav vishleshak jiviel narsingh raav kehete hai, 'jab ham congress ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaate hai to ham uski raajnneeti, vichaardhaara ko chunauti dete hai
 It is not that we want to end the Congress
 darasal, congress kii vajah se desh ko jo nuksaan hua he, ham uski baat karte hai
 An analysis of the Lok Sabha election data shows that in areas where the BJP had a direct fight with the Congress, the party had a winning rate of 88 percent and where it had contested regional parties 49 percent
 rajnatik lihaaj se bijepi ke liye congress yukt bharat mufeed he
 Recently, the solidarity of the Janata Parivar has increased the difficulties of the party
 bijepi ko lagata he ki janata parivaar bihar main uske liye badi chunauti pesh karegaa
 Hence, the party is eyeing people like RJD Senikale MP Pappu Yadav and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi
 vaise party rahul ko tarjeeh dekar yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki uske mukaable main sirf congress hi he
 a BJP official says, "the negative comments like Modi's death dealer made him a hero, we also will not encourage Rahul by making such personal remarks
" lekin rahul ko nitigat masalon par tathyon ke saath jawaab diya jayega
 ' loksabhaa chunaav ke kareeb aane ke saath hi raajnneetik dalon ke netaa ek duusare kii tikhi aalochana main jute gaye hai
 Beyond criticism, leaders are now attacking each other
 ek aisi hi ghatana televijan par shanivaar ko dikhi, jab ek news channel par jari live dibet kaarykram ke dauraan congress ke pravaktaa alok sharma ne bhartiya janata party ke pravaktaa keke sharma par pani bharaa glass phenk diya
 The video went viral on social media
 video main yah saaf najar aa rahaa he ki bhaajapa pravaktaa dwaara alok sharma ko baar-baar deshadrohi kahe jane par vah krodhit ho gaye or unhone pani bharaa glass un par phenk diya
 The glass jacket also made the anchor jacket wet
 kaarykram ko jari rakhane ke liye ankar ko kapade badalane pade
 The pieces of broken glass shattered in the studio but no one was hurt by it
 is dauraan bhaajapa pravaktaa ne alok sharma ne unase is harakat ke liye maafee maangane ke liye kaha lekin sharma bhi khud ko deshadrohi kahe jane par bhaajapa pravaktaa se maafee mangavane kii baat par ade rahe
 The seventh edition of Aaj Tak's Maha Manch Agenda has started
 iske duusare satr main 'kanoon se banegaa ram mandir' par baat hui
 AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi and senior Supreme Court advocate KTS Tulsi participated in it
 is satr kaa sanchaalan shweta singh ne kiya
 Tulsi said that enacting a law on Ram temple meant hanging the issue further, while BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the construction work of the temple is of trust, BJP will only remove the obstacles coming in the way of its construction
 kya kanoon banaakar ram mandir kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he? is par supreme court ke varisht adhivaktaa keties tulsi ne kaha ki agar kanoon banaakar ram mandir ke nirmaan ke bare main sochaa jaataa he to yah mandir ke nirmaan main deree ko bulaava dena he
 He told that after enactment of the law, it will be challenged in the Supreme Court
 court notice bhejega uskaa jawaab maangega, donon pakshon ko bulaayaa jayega
 This entire process will not take less than one and a half years
 sabase acha yahi hoga ki supreme court main isaki sunwaayee chal rahi he vahi chale
 If there is a continuous hearing from January, the decision can be reached in 4 months
 keties tulsi ne saath main yah bhi bataaya ki sunwaayee ke liye court par dabaab nahin daalaa ja saktaa
 Tulsi said that the court sat at midnight to hear the petition put on the verdict of death as it was to be executed the next day
 ram mandir kaa maamla aisa nahin he ram mandir kaa maamla tital suut he
 This cannot be settled like this
 aapas main baithkar kar len batketies tulsi ne kaha ki sabase acha yah he ki donon paksh aapas main baithkar tay kar len
 It would be more appropriate to build a temple with mutual consent
 ram mandir par tulsi ne kaha ki guru nanak ne bhi kaha tha ki ram kaa janm vahiin hua tha
 Speaking on the construction of the temple by law, Sudhanshu Trivedi said that it is the only temple in the world whose case has been in court for one and a half years
 doosraa yah duniya ke iklaute bhagwaan hai jo khud court main mukadmaa lard rahe hai
 For the first time in the third world, the title suit of God is going on
 unhone apratyaksh rup se congress ko lapetate hue kaha ki tab tital suut daakhil kiya gaya ki 12 saal puure ho rahe the or taala khulne ke vakt nikal jaataa
 Sudhanshu tried to explain in a logical manner that the idols were revealed in 1949, the court said, "worship
" hai court ne bhi nirnay dete hue kabhi bhi ise babari masjid nahin kaha
 Challenging AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi said that if there is power in the government, he should try to enact a law on the Ram temple
 use chalange kiya jayega
 He denied Sudhanshu Trivedi's talk of the statues appearing, stating that the idols were kept there
 exiaar main is baat kaa zikr he
 The Congress opened the lock
 dhaancha giraane kaa maamla bhi supreme court main chal rahaa he
 This is also a criminal case
 owesi kaa kahana tha ki yah maamla tital suut kaa he or supreme court hi is par faisla kar saktaa he
 This matter cannot be settled on the basis of faith
 owesi ne kaha ki krishna kumaar ke maamle main nirnay aa chukaa he ki aap samvidhan se dhokhaa nahin kar sakate
 He further said that if the country starts running on the basis of faith, then what will be the difference between us and the neighboring country
 ovaisi ne kaha ki chif justise maanate hai ki yah tital suut he to iskaa faisla usee aadhaar par aana chahie
 What kind of expectation from the court? But KTS Tulsi told a story of Pakistan in which he told that Guru Arjun Dev was martyred in Lahore
 vahaan sikhon ne gurudwara banavaa diya
 The Muslims broke it down and built a mosque there, then the Sikhs built a gurdwara there
 yah maamla court se hote hue privi concil tak pahunchaa
 It was said that what was there will not decide what should happen there
 tulsi ne kaha ki concil ne kaha ki yahaan par arjuna dev kii shahidi hui thi isliye vahaan par gurudwara hona chahie
 Sudhanshu gave all the arguments that 12 pillars were found in the excavation after which the excavation was stopped
 unhone kai kaviyon kaa zikr kiya jinhone ram kii prashansa kii he
 On this, Owaisi said that why your party does not make you a lawyer in the Supreme Court
 ovaisi kaa tark tha ki agar in baton main jaaenge to koi hal nahin nikalegaa
 We should wait for the court's verdict
 court ke saamne ye sab nahin chalegaa vahaan keval pramaan chalenge
 Owaisi also reminded that the decision of the High Court was stayed by the Supreme Court saying that it is a Strange decision
 ovaisi ne kaha ki maamla tital shoot main gaya tha vahaan se partishan main niklaa
 Sudhanshu said that Babar's rule was a total of two and a half years and why Mir went to the rest of Ayodhya
 is sawaal par ki bijepi kii sarkaar aegi to mandir ban jayega ke jawaab main sudhanshu ne kaha ki jo log pehle kehete the ki yahaan babari masjid phir se banaaenge jaise mulaayam singh or narsimha raav aaj unki party ke log aisa nahin kehete
 Akhilesh talks about building a grand Vishnu temple there
 sudhanshu ne kaha ki puure desh main yah jaagrukta ai he log ram mandir kii baat karne lage hai
 It is a symbol of a changed atmosphere
 aazaadee ke 70 saal baad bhi hamen babar kii aulad mana jaataa he- ovaisiovaisi ne aarope lagaaya ki bharat ko aaazaad hue 70 saal ho gaye lekin aaj bhi musalamaanon ko babar kii santan mana jaataa he
 BJP is talking of Ram temple to affect 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 aasthaa ke aadhaar par iskaa faisla nahin ho saktaa
 Sudhanshu Trivedi, responding to his talk, said that our resolve is that Ram temple should be built there and be grand but the work of building the temple is of trust, BJP will solve all the difficulties in its path
 sudhanshu ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki congress daam ke liye ram mandir ke paksh main khadi thi or ham ram ke liye
 Ravi Shankar Prasad was our advocate on behalf of Ramlala
 is par keties tulsi ne kaha ki court of conduct ke mutabik koi vakil maamla lene se manaa nahin kar saktaa agar use fees mil rahi he or uske paas samay he
 Owaisi said that Sibal has now been refused to appear in the Ram temple case
 ovaisi ne kaha ki garibi dur karnaa bhi sarkaar kaa kaam he mandir supreme court ke faisle par chhod diya janaa chahie
 On this, Sudhanshu Trivedi counted the names of all the organizations that the RSS runs
 This Owaisi said tauntingly that you are the spokesperson of the BJP or the RSS
 sudhanshu ne kaha ki sachhar kamity or ranganath mishra cameti kii report congress ne nahin lagu kii
 On this, Owaisi asked that you tell how many reports your government has implemented of the Sachar Committee, Ranganath Committee and Kundu Committee
 musalaamanon ko mili aarakshanh ovaisiovaisi ne kaha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 15, 16 ke mutabik musalamaanon ko bhi aarakshan milanaa chahie
 If it is not based on religion, then it should be on the basis of caste because there are many castes which are very poor
 sudhanshu ne kaha ki agar yah sabit ho jaae ki musalamaanon ko padhane nahin diya gaya to aisa ho saktaa he lekin musalamaanon ne bharat par shashan kiya he
 What can the government do if they quit their studies, go to madrasas
 ovaisi ne sawaal uthaae ki aaj kii garibi dekhi jaani chahie
 Which was also supported by KTS Tulsi
 tulsi ne kaha ki samvidhan main aarakshan kii baat he usamen kaha gaya he ki aaj ke halaat par aarakshan dene waalon kii pahchaan ho
 On Sudhanshu's claim that 8 percent of Muslims are in Gujarat and seven and a half percent are in government jobs
 ovaisi ne poocha ki 26 saal se gujarat main koi muslim saansad kyon nahin he
 On the point of Sudhanshu that it should be considered that the king of Rampur, the princely state of Junagadh, the Nawab of Lucknow were so rich, so why in poverty today? Owaisi took his stand and said that if you believe that Muslims have become poor, then why can't they be given reservation
 musalamaanon ko de sakate hai aarakshan : keties tulsiketies tulsi ne kaha ki jo cast becoward hai unhen aarakshan diya ja saktaa he
 Owaisi said that you can give it to the Marathas
 jaaton ko de sakate hai, duusari jatiyon ko de sakate hai to musalamaanon ko kyon nahin
 Sudhanshu opposed this and said that Muslims get reservation on the basis of castes
 sudhanshu ne kaha tha ki dharmik aadhaar par aarakshan ek baar hi diya gaya tha vah bhi 1916 main or uskaa parinaam vibhaajan niklaa
 On this, Owaisi reminded Sardar Patel, in which he had said in the drafting committee meeting that Muslims would be given equal rights
 keval chhattisgarh main vyaavhaarik haar : sudhanshu trivedirajyon main bijepi ke khilaaf nattejey aane par sudhanshu ne kaha ki empi main party technical rup se haari he
 This argument of the BJP is a reminder of the Congress statement after the defeat in the Gujarat elections in which the party termed it a moral defeat
 soshal media par tab congress ke is bayaan kii khub chutki lee gai thi
 The vote percentage in Rajasthan has remained intact
 vahiin chhattisgarh main vyavaharik haar hui he
 This Owaisi said that these people wanted to win elections with the help of Ram temple but that issue is dead, now they should think about public interest
 ovaisi ne kashmir main hinsa kaa maamla uthaate hue kaha ki 2014 ke baad sabase zyada hinsa hui he
 In response to a question from the public, Owaisi said that if children are killed there, who is responsible for the maximum security personal, then who will be responsible for that
 yah sawaal sarkaar se poocha janaa chahie

 Read here, two poems of Babusha Kohli, in their breathless sarcasm, their stinging disappointments in their movements, and we dance in the streets, the earth trembles with the footsteps of our feet and they sigh with agony as if their souls are stuck on their deep nails Even in our souls, we have tied the rashes with hot tongs and we have tied ourselves In the village, there is a grunt stuck on the neck of the past, their heavy steps
 The amoeba continuously spreading in the water, the rhythm of a waterfall unattainable from its past and future shines in their stomachs
 They tie the waist tightly
 Dancing is like dancing on the road
 The earth is round and round
 It is covered with a dance
 When Ri souls dance Nirvstrhmare dance they can Vilaphm on their mourning a two-minute silent dance that also brings the dance of mourning postures to us
 i am the gentleman of the room of the Rummies, fluttering from the navel of Hantraj
 There are no tears, my country, if in this terrible calamity, my mouth blisters and i cannot say anything
 Punish me my dumbness at the intersections of history
 My soil, the winds in my lungs, and the waters that irrigate me in my hard times Thuknao on neutrality came across my open skies, o humble tree and flaming fire Sikhaon tongue at me penalties Denafansi for boils is certainly not! My body for the smart silence the penalty clock flick in Denaapani memories - lifelong pakistan kii amanviya karatuut se shahid hue lansnayak sudhakar singh or lansnayak hemraj ke shav jammu laae gaye hai

 Stand-up comedian Kapil Sharma, who hosted big stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan in the popular TV show 'comedy Nights with Kapil', is now on the silver screen as an actor from the Yash Raj banner thriller-comedy film 'bank-chor' Going to debut 'kamedi nits vid kapil' se pehle tivi sho 'da great indian lofter chalange' or phir 'kamedi sarkas' ke jariye ghar-ghar main janaa-pahachaanaa naam bane kapil sharma ne ab teen filmon or pratibha prabandhan ke liye yashraj films ke saath anubandh par hastakshar kiye hai
 It is noteworthy that y-films, the youth wing of the same studio, made a film like 'mere Dad's Maruti' last year
 kapil sharma ne ek vaktavy main kaha, ''yah sammaan he or viaref parivaar kaa hissaa bananaa meraa sapana tha or unki youth films studio vaai-films se meraa padaarpan hoga
 
 
 Its ('bank-thief') screenplay is the most fascinating aspect of it, because it is completely different from a role in which a comedian could be imagined, or the way people could typecast me
 
 
 '' Kapil Sharma said that he has already started working on his character, in which he will be seen in a different avatar
 unhone kaha, ''maine hameshaa thriller ko pasand kiya or dekha, or yah ek thriller-kamedi he, isliye or behatar he

 '' ham sabhi ke gharon main aisi bahut si keemtee chijen hoti hai jinhen chor chura sakate hai

 Mirror
 com kii ek report ke mutabik choron kaa kahana he ki log apane gharon ko surakshit rakhane main chook jate hai or isliye choron cochori karne main aasaani hoti he
 Many thieves have commented and given their suggestions on the question asked about saving homes on Reddit
 choron ne jo suzav die hai wo is prakaar hai:1
 In today's time, LED lights are very cheap
 ''agar aap kuch dinon ke liye kahin baahar ja rahe hai to aap apane gharon main smart linting system lagava sakate hai
 With this, you will light the lights in different parts of the house from time to time
 (jaise raat ke khaane ke vakt rasoi main, sote vakt bedroom main aadi)
 2
 ''apni keemtee vastuon ko baahar na rakhen jinhen koi bhi aapke ghar main ghuse bina hi aasaani se dekh sake
 If you buy a new TV or computer, do not keep its box near the dustbin, but break it completely ''
 3
 Look for some other place to put the keys to your house and do not place them under the doormat, in the plant pot, or above the door of the house
 4
 If you want, you can keep your small valuables in a place where thieves do not even think to look
 udhaaharan ke liye ek agnishamak (fire Extinguisher)5
 Also lock your house shed because if you leave the main gate closed and leave the shed open, the thief can easily enter from there and carry out the theft
 6
 Remember to close the windows of the house
 aisa kai baar hota he ki jaldbaaji main log apane gharon kii khidakiyon ko khulaa chhod dete hai or is vajah se chor aasaani se ghus jate hai
 7
 kisi bhi celsman se apane yaa apane ghar ke bare main zyada baat na karen
 8
 choron se apane keemtee saamaan ko bachaane ke liye aap ek jaal bhi bicha sakate hai
 For this, you can put a lot of cheap jewelery which is expensive to look, in any good place in a box where the thief's attention goes easily
 aisa karne par agar chor aata bhi he to vah fatafat se us jewelri ko lekar bhaag jayega or ghar ke baaki hisson main kuch nahin dhundhega
 9
 keemtee vastuon ko rakhane ke liye koi bhi choti Safe surakshit nahin he agar use do log aasaani se uthaa sakate hai
 So keep your valuables in a big safe, which 2,3 people cannot carry

 If any valuable item is kept in your car, do not leave it empty

 In order to provide relief to the common man from the prices of petrol and diesel, there is a demand to bring these products under the purview of GST
 maharashtra ke vitt mantri sudhir munagatiwar kii maane to yah kaam jald ho saktaa he
 According to him, all the states have given permission to bring petrol and diesel under GST
 unke mutabik ab in utpaadon ko iske tahat laane ke liye hamen sahi vakt kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 After coming under the purview of GST, you will get petrol and diesel within just Rs 43

 unhone bataaya tha ki jiesti parishad se petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane ko lekar vichaar karne ko kaha he
 If the government does this work, then the common man can benefit greatly
 28 fisadi jiesti lagane par ye hogi keembgar petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jaataa he, to is par zyada se zyada 28 fisadi tex lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Because this is the highest tax slab in GST
 28 fisadi tex vasule jane par ek litre petrol aapako dilli main kareeb 43 rupee main padegaa
 Which is about half of the current price of petrol
 khatm ho jayega exise or vaidgar petrol jiesti ke tahat aa jaataa he, to exise duty or rajyon kii taraf se lagane vaala waite khatm ho jayega
 Under the new tax policy, after adding the dealer commission, the price of one liter of petrol 33
 66 rupye ho jaati he
 To add 28 percent GST to it, you get 9
 42 rupee or dene honge
 In this way you get 43 liters of 1 liter petrol in Delhi
 08 rupee main milegaa
 Talking about one liter diesel diesel will be Rs 41, then it will be 32 after adding dealer commission
 15 rupee ho jaataa he
 If GST is added to it, then 9
 02 rupee or judega
 In this way 1 liter diesel will give you only 41
 17 rupee main milegaa
 If petrol and diesel are covered under GST, their prices will be reduced to half of the current prices directly

" unhone kaha, yah vah samay he, jab maamle kii sunwaayee karne vaale satr nyaayadhish apane adhikaar kaa prayog karte hue aropiyon ke liye nyaay mitra niyukt karen yaa dilli rajya vidhi seva praadhikaran (dlese) se aropiyon ko kanoonee sahaayta muhaiyaa karaane ke liye kahen

 samuhik balaatkaar maamla saket adaalat ke nyaay kshetra main hi aata he
 Former Delhi High Court judge Usha Mehra said that the judge of the lower court should ensure the service of lawyers to the accused as soon as the trial starts
 nyaayamurti mishra ne kaha, meraa maananaa he ki mahilaon ke khilaaf aise jaghanya aparaadh ke maamalon ko aropiyon or peedit ke bayanon ke aadhaar par chalaaya janaa chahie, kyonki aisi prakruti ke maamle antat: police dwaara ekatrit sabooton par nirbhar hote hai
 He said, the police should record the statement of the accused and the aggrieved party before a judicial officer
 abhiyojan or bachaav paksh ke bayaan vibhinn staron par darj kyon kiye jane chahie? hamen bhartiya sakshya kanoon main parivartan karnaa chahie
 Judge Mishra said, if the statements of the accused and the victim are recorded before a judicial officer, then what is the need for a lawyer to file it in court for the second time, as has been done till now
 nyaayamurti mishra ne kaha, adaalaton ke liye keval jo cheez bachegi, vah jirah or bahes hogi or twarit adaalaton main sunwaayee aise hi tej ho sakegi
 The second time the statement is recorded in the court there is a possibility of fraud, witnesses are retracted and in many cases the main witness is killed
 samuhik balaatkaar maamle kii jaanch ke liye gathit ek-sadasyeey jaanch ayog kii pramukh nyaayamurti mehara ne haalanki pehle bhi kaha he ki kai maamalon main vakil aropiyon kaa mukadmaa ladane se inkaar kar dete hai or unhen aropiyon kaa mukadmaa ladane ke liye baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The judge of the lower court, however, has the right to provide a legal aid or appoint a jurist to defend the accused
 nyaayamurti mehara ne kaha, yadi vakil aropiyon kaa mukadmaa nahin ladane kaa faisla karte hai, to ham unhen iske liye baadhya nahin kar sakate
 He said, this is the time when the Sessions Judge hearing the case appoints the amicus curiae for the accused or ask the Delhi State Law Services Authority (DLSA) to provide legal assistance to the accused
 tippaniyan Expressing grief over the death of the Delhi gang rape victim, President of Delhi Bar Council RS Goswami said that although the council cannot make any rules by asking the lawyers not to fight the case of the accused in this case, they can ask them to be accused in such heinous cases
 May request not to appear on behalf of saket adaalat ke baar association ke upaadhyaksh arun rathi ne kaha, saket baar association 23-varshiya chaatra ke saath samuhik balaatkaar maamle main aropiyon kaa mukadmaa nahin ladane ke apane sankalp par kaayam he
 The gang rape case comes under the jurisdiction of Saket court
 unhone kaha, police ko aropiyon or peedit paksh kaa bayaan ek nyaayik adhikari ke samaksh darj karnaa chahie
 Why should prosecution and defense statements be recorded at different levels? We should change the Indian Evidence Act
 nyaayadhish mishra ne kaha, yadi aropiyon or peedit ke bayaan ek nyaayik adhikari ke samaksh darj kiye jate hai, to ek vakil ke liye use duusari baar adaalat main darj karne kii kya aavashyaktaa he, jaisaa ki ab tak kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Justice Mishra said, the only thing left for the courts would be arguments and arguments and hearings in the fast courts would be speeded up like this
 duusari baar bayaan ke adaalat main darj hone se chal-kapat hone kii sambhaavna hoti he, gavaah mukar jate hai or kai maamalon main to mukhya gavaah kii hatya ho jaati he
 Justice Mehra, the head of the one-member inquiry commission set up to investigate the gang rape case, has also said earlier that in many cases, the lawyers refuse to prosecute the accused and cannot be compelled to contest the case of the accused 
 haalanki nichali adaalat ke nyaayadhish ke paas yah adhikaar he ki vah aropiyon kaa bachaav karne ke liye vidhik sahaayta se vakil muhaiyaa kara sakate hai yaa nyaay mitra niyukt kar sakate hai

 Priyanka Gandhi, the party general secretary and in-charge of eastern UP, has become active to bring the party back to power after the humiliating defeat of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske liye uttar pradesh main congress ke sanghathan main bade badlaav se pehle priyanka gandhi ke teenon sachiv sabhi jilon kaa daura karke sthaneey netaaon or kaaryakartaaon se raay shumaari karenge

 Priyanka Gandhi is constantly meeting these days to discuss the reasons for the party's defeat in the recent Lok Sabha elections as well as the formation of a strong party organization for the 2022 assembly elections
 haal hi main priyanka gandhi ne haar kii samiksha par baithak kii or party kii jamini hakeekat se bhi waakif ho rahi hai, jisamen rojaanaa koi nai baat saamne aa rahi he
 In the review meeting, Priyanka Gandhi received a complaint that the domineering and staunch leaders of the Congress at their level have done a lot of arbitrariness for the local posts in the organization
 jamini hakeekat ye bhi he ki kuch mandalon ke netao ne to bandarbaat main had paar kar di
 Priyanka Gandhi was meeting with the leaders in Purvanchal, during which the Coordinator told about a district in Varanasi division that the district president there is the driver of a big Congress leader

 After this, there are indications of huge changes in the organization
 sutron ke anusaar priyanka gandhi ne baithak main kaha ki vah sanghathan main mahaj badlaav ke liye koi pherbadal nahin karnaa chaahati hai, balki vah chaahati hai ki is baar badlaav jamini str par thok baja kar ho taaki party ko har haal main majbootee mili or party sanghathan khadaa ho sake
 Priyanka Gandhi has assigned new responsibilities to her associated secretaries Bajirao Khade, Zubair Khan and Sachin Nayak
 in teenon sachivon ko apane-apane kshetron kaa daura kar loksabhaa chunaav main eemaandaaree se party ke liye acha kaam karne vaale netaaon ke naam bhi dene ko kaha gaya he

 pakistan ke saath parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa istemaal or vikaas na karne ke kisi bhi samjhaute se inkaar karte hue 1979 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri morarji desai ne kaha tha ki yadi islamabad ne parmaanu visphot kiya to iskaa ‘kadaa jawaab’ diya jayega
 This was revealed in the link of confidential documents made public by the US
 dastavej ke anusaar morarji ne yah chetavanee bharat main america ke tatkaaleen rajdoot robert epa gohin ke saath ek baithak main di thi
 The meeting, which took place at Goheen's insistence, lasted for 55 minutes, which took place under the directions of the National Security Council of the White House
 america sarkaar ne gohin se kaha tha ki vah pradhanmantri morarji desai ke saath ek ‘anaupchaarik’ mulaakaat karen jisamen kisi prakaar kii vachanabaddhata na ho
 Starting with the fact that the US wants to work with India on the Pakistani nuclear threat, Gohin underlined that 'india is an essential part of any solution
 ’ dastavej main kaha gaya ki desai kii haalanki hathiyaaron kaa istemaal or vikaas na karne ke mudde par kisi sanyukt samjhaute ke vichaar main ruchi nahin thi
 Arguing that he had already made such a commitment, Desai had said that if Pakistan does so, "both the commitments will be as good as the joint agreement"
 ’morarji ne gohin kii is salaah ko khaarij kar diya ki aupchaarik samjhauta zyada prabhavi hoga or kul milakar unhone parmaanu hathiyaar mukt kshetra kii avadharana ko nakaar diya
 According to the document, when asked about Gohin's response to India's response to Pakistan's nuclear weapons test, Morarji said aggressively, "if he finds that Pakistan is ready to conduct a nuclear test or if he does the test
" So he will take immediate action to answer it
 ’morarji ne kaha ki unhone haal hi main pakistan ke videsh sachiv shahanvaj ko aashwaasan diya tha ki pakistan ke prati bharat kii acchhee manshaa he or vah aisa kuch nahin karnaa chahta jisase pakistan kii kathinaayee bade lekin saath hi is bare main bhi cheta diya tha ki ‘yadi pakistan koi chalbaaji chalata he to makul jawaab diya jayega
 In his confidential telegram detailing his meeting with Morarji, Goheen wrote, 'I felt that he (morarji) was reminding Shahnawaz of 1965 and 1971 in order to emphasize India's readiness in the event of provocative action
 
 ’ pakistan ne aakhirkaar bharat dwaara doosraa parmaanu pareekshan kiye jane par 1998 main apana parmaanu visphot kiya
 Morarji had said that he has expressed unilateral commitments
 If Pakistan also does so, then both the commitments will be as good as the joint agreement

 Wierre is a well-known adventurer and author of several books
 (input bhashaa se) Honeypreet finally came under police arrest after 38 days, but sources claim that Honeypreet was in touch with Haryana Police for the last 5 days
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaankaree hone ke baavjood bhi police ne haniprit insa ko giraftaar kyun nahin kiya
 Honeypreet is now behind bars after being absconded
 beete din, ajtak ko die gaye intervyuu main haniprit ne apni safai pesh kii thi
 Shortly thereafter, the police arrested him from Zirakpur in Punjab
 lekin is maamle main sutara kuch or hi kah rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, Honeypreet was in touch with Haryana Police for the last 5 days
 jiske baad bhi use giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 Sources also said that his lawyer had already informed the police about Honeypreet's surrender
 haniprit pehle hi media ke saamne aakar sahanubhuti card khilne kaa plan bana chuki thi
 Even the Punjab Police was aware of Honeypreet, but she was not arrested as no case was filed against her in Punjab
 sutron ke mutabik, haniprit chandigarh se 25 kimi
 Away also lived in a resort in Banur area of patiala
 sab kuch plan ke anusaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 Honeypreet was advised to talk to the media on behalf of the camp
 haniprit to 26 sitambar ko dilli hai court ke baahar police ke saamne sarender karne vaali thi
 But later he changed the plan
 ab sawaal uthta he ki agar haryana police ko haniprit ke bare main jaankaree thi to kyun use giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 After all, why did Honeypreet keep a puzzle for 38 days
 kya ab khatter sarkaar un police adhikariyon par karrwai karegi, jo is dauraan apni duty nibhaane main asafal rahe
 Or it was done at the behest of leaders close to Ram Rahim
 hairaan karne vaali baat to yah he ki dere main number 2 kii haisiyat rakhane vaali haniprit kii giraftaar ke samay koi samarthak saamne nahin aayaa
 While at the time of Ram Rahim, violence was spread in many states
 haalanki, beete din maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta or vakil momin malik ne thane jaakar haniprit se milane kii koshish kii

 During his official visit to Singapore from May 31 to June 2, Modi proposed to his Singapore counterpart Lee Sean Loong that India and Singapore should organize a joint hackathon
 lee ne is prastaav kaa swaagat kiya tha
 Singapore had entrusted the task of organizing this hackathon to Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and ntutive
 bharat ne isaki jimmedaari ol india council for technical ajukeshan (eisitii) ko di thi
 The Indian High Commission in Singapore together with Singapore's Ministry of Education and Foreign Affairs made the event possible
 donon deshon se 20-20 tiimon ne is pratiyogita main hissaa liya

 In the dim light of the study on the second floor of his house "mannat", Shah Rukh Khan looks a little lean and tired
 yahaan kii tarateeb main air purifire bhi utani hi sajaavat kii cheez maaloom detaa he jitani lakdi kii almariyon main rakhi kitaaben, dividi or inaam main mili trophiyaan
 His day had started well
 subah unhone apane teen bacchon- 18 saal ke aryan, 15 saal kii suhana or 2 saal ke abram- ke saath kuch samay guzaara tha
 Then there was an engagement with film distributors and the promotion of his first film Fan released in 2016
 ise yashraj films ne banaaya he
 The film does not match Khan's recent films
 isamen sirf ek gaanaa he jisamen shahrukh kaa behad dublaa-patala hamshakl naachata hua dikhataa he
 In Khan's own words, "you may ask why is he doing this?" And i fully agree with it
 mujhe laga ki yah karnaa chahie
 After spending 25 years of my life on an art, i think that i have the right to do what i want to do
 ”“yah vyavsaayik duniya badi hi ajeeb he”unki pichhali relies hui teen filmon&dilavaale (2015), happy new year (2014) or chennai express (2013)- ko khud unhone produs kiya tha
 These were Natasthak films ahead of the formula
 khan pakke taur par maanate hai ki in filmon ne unke adaakaari ke hunar ko lalakaara tha
 He says, "the business world is strange, fake
" dilavaale jaisi filmon main actor ke taur par srujanaatmak prayog kii bahut zyada gunjaaish nahin rahati or bharosa dilaane vaale andaaj main yah kahana bhi ki “ham sharif kya hue, duniya badmaash ho gai
 "it (chennai Express) was not my kind of laughing-joke but it was fun in a different way
 aapke sabase kalpanasheel hisse ko sabase zyada vyavsaayik filmein karte hue hi aajmaana hota he
 Other films like Chak De! In India, the world assures you that you are that character
 ”50 kii umr ke paar kadam rakhane ke baad ab khan bandhi-bandhai li se hatakar chalane ke liye taiyaar hai
 This year he will be seen in Fan directed under Manish Sharma
 phir rahul dholkia kii rais main gangster kaa role karenge
 In this, he will compete with Nawazuddin Siddiqui
 iske baad ve gauri scindia ke nirdesan main ban rahi or aalia bhatta kii adaakaari vaali anaam film main chote magar ahm role main dikhaai denge
 He is also the co-producer of this film
 ve imtiyaaj ali kii “pyaari, halki-phulki” film ko shuru karne ke liye betaab hai
 Anand L
 raay ke saath bhi ve ek film karne ke bare main soch rahe hai
 "my work scale is my child" for Khan's fans, Swadesh (2004), Paheli (2005) and Chak De! There is a hint of a return to India (2007)
 ye aisi filmein thim jinamein kirdaar kii ahmiyat star se zyada thi
 Fan will have both SRK Star and Actor
 isamen ve ek superstar aryan khanna bane hai or vijual effect kii badaulat unke sabase bade fain 24 baras ke gaurav bhi ve hi bane hai
 The film begins with Fan's worship towards his Idol and quickly turns into enmity between the two
 yah khan kii dharre kii film kii tarah nahin maaloom detii- aisi film jisase teen dinon main 100 karod ru
 It is expected to collect
 kai log unhen bechney main bhi awwal darje kaa maahir maanate hai
 But Khan denies this reputation
 ve kehete hai, “main film kaa anjaam yaa uske aankade nahin jaanata, log maan lete hai ki main jaanata hum
 However, what they know about the fan is their sense of mind
 aryan or suhana ne film dekhi or shhamen aapke upar naaj haiy vaali galabahiyon ke saath ise manjuur kar diya
 Children are not so passionate about all their films
 abram bhi darshakon main tha magar thodi der baad vah baichaiyn ho gaya
 Shahrukh says, "I now evaluate all my work through my children
 unke alaava meri jindagi kii koi vajah nahin
 i want to emphasize them, get something good out of them
 ” shahrukh ke liye unki pratikriya ahm he
 He says, "they may not be the best audience, but they are good viewers
" yaa ho saktaa he unhone mujhe 50 kii najuk haalat main dekh liya ho
 "satan is in you and spirit is restless" There have been whispers in recent times about his weakness, his sensitivity and his challenge to the king in Bollywood
 salmaan or aamir to lagaataar unke saath-saath hai hi, umr main bhi or hode main bhi
 They have surpassed them
 salmaan kii bajrangi bhaijan or aamir kii pike ne 300 karod ru
 Crossed the figure of
 yahaan tak ki bharat main bajirao mastaani kii kamai ne bhi dilavaale ko pachhad diya
 "will they do, will they not, will they not" - Shahrukh dismisses such questions
 ve santusht nahin hote
 He says, "I just can't make a film in two years
" yah ubaau he
 "he pauses for a moment and tries to remember part of his argument at the University of Edinburgh
 phir kehete hai, “saamaanya sirf ubaau hi nahin he
 It is a way to die
 yah ajeeb dimagi ehsaas he
 i am a big star
 main baahar se bahut shant dikhataa hum
 But i am disturbed from inside
 shaitan aapke andar rahata he
 It is never satisfied
 ”“samay se pehle kiya he chizon ko”khan bollywood ke saath itane ekmec ho gaye hai ki yah bhul janaa aasaan he ki aamir or salmaan kii tarah isse unka koi khandaani rishta nahin tha
 He started with Deewana (1992)
 2017 main sho bijness main unki nijee silver jubilee hogi
 He says, "I used to get upset with it until a few years ago when people claimed that" he (rolls) "
 nahin yaar, main vah banda hum jisane kai alag-alag chijen kii hai or vah bhi jab unhen karnaa fashnabal bhi nahin tha
 i will never die with an unfulfilled desire to keep doing something new
 ” khan kah yah rahe hai ki unhone villen (dar, anjaam), aakhir main ladki ko haar jane vaale hero (kabhi haa kabhi naa), anti-hero (baazeegar), kala filmon ke kalakaar (maaya memsaab), parde par apane pratidwandviyon ke saath aana (karan arjuna, trimurti) or phir sab par chaa jane vaale romantic hero (dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge) tak sab kuch kiya he or vah bhi apane kariyar ke pehle paanch saal main
 For him, being the hero of Aziz Mirza's film has been as comfortable as that of Karan Johar
 unki saat filmon ne sarvshereshth film kaa rashtriya puraskaar jeeta
 Khan could not win even one yet
 yah baat unhen pareshaan karti he? “main uske liye tarasata nahin hum par use yahaan is almaari main rakhane ke liye mere paas bahut jagah he, isliye use paanaa chaahunga
 "someone will cut my arm apart" as an actor, he is fearless
 insaan hone ke naate unhen dar lagata he
 Their biggest fear is, "someone will cut my arm and cut me apart
" ” yah dar us shaks ko lagata he jisane slo moshan main apane baajuon ke failaane ko nrity kii ek mohak mudra bana diya he
 There is a hunger for acting
 haa, khan abhi jaldi kahin jane vaale nahin hai
 He says, "first let me be crocodile
 main abhi itnaa mahaan nahin hua ki vinamr ho sakuun
 "you do not tell Lata Mangeshkar, Sachin Tendulkar and Bachchan sahab," he says, citing the book he has written and which is expected to be released next year

 shouri, sinha or bhushan par chutki lete hue shah ne kaha ki rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman ke bayaan par vishwaas kiya janaa chahie, na ki un logon par jinhen kaam nahin mila
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that after the Modi government talks, the base price of the Rafale fighter aircraft is lower than the price fixed by the UPA
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki sarkaar vipaksh ke aaropon ke baad maamle main pehle hi sthiti saaf kar chuki he
 Explain that Shourie, Sinha and senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, who were ministers in the NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had on Wednesday claimed that the alleged scam related to the Rafale deal was much bigger than the Bofors scandal
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, 'rakshaamantri ke bayaan par bharosa kiya jayega yaa un par jinhen kaam (mantri pad) nahin mila
 'arun Shourie calls Rafael deal' big scam 'from Bofors, the government dismisses the allegations when Amit Shah was asked that PM Modi has asked the opposition to bring a no-confidence motion again in 2024
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki phir se modi sarkaar banegi? is par amit shah ne kaha ki desh kii janata 2019 main phir se modi ko bahumat degi
 We will take to the public the account of the work of the last five years and the blueprint for the next five years
 janata kii ankhen or bhav sab bayaan kar dete hai ki wo modi ko phir se jitaane ja rahi he
 Amit Shah said that the BJP will get a bigger majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections than in 2014
 desh kii janata modi ko phir se pradhanmantri banane kaa man bana chuki he
 We have no doubt about it
 shah ne bainkon ke saath dhokhadhadi ke aaropee mehul chokasee or neerav modi ke desh se bhaagane ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki unke khilaaf modi sarkaar kii lagaataar karrwai se sunishchit hoga ki desh main ab kam chor honge

 Tendulkar made the remark after an awkward feud between the Sobo Supersonics and the Akash Tigers Mumbai Western Suburb in the semi-finals of the Mumbai T20 League on Saturday
 unhone kaha, ‘jo bhi maine dekha, wo maine pehali baar dekha he or phir maine sochna shuru kiya ki kya kiya ja saktaa he or yah ek ded ball nahin ho sakati
 But the rules are such that whatever happened, it was the right thing at that time
 ’tendulkar ne kaha, ‘lekin main soch rahaa tha ki badlaav ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he, jo aane vaale samay main lagu kiya ja saktaa he or mujhe lagata he ki agar sarkal ke andar teen kshetrarakshak hai to ampire unhen kabhi nahin kahata ki aapako chauthaa kshetrarakshak ring main lagane kii jarurat he or agar no ball hoti he or iske liye free hit he
 Therefore the fielding team is fined for this
 ’unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin jab ballebaaj apane chor par nahin pahunchate to ballebaaji karne vaali team par jurmaana kyon nahin lagata? mujhe lagata he ki ballebaaji karne vaali team ko bhi sajaa milani chahie
 And how many runs can he score on a ball, which is seven runs with one last no ball and runs on free hits
 isliye shaayad yahaan par ballebaaji karne vaali team par saat ran kaa jurmaana laganaa chahie

 Tanks were out on the first ball after taking a wrong strike
 ampiron ko mahasoos hua ki ballebaajon ne chor nahin badla tha to unhone ise ded ball qaraar kar diya, jisase akaash tigers kii team ko wicket nahin mila, jabaki galati puri tarah se ballebaajon kii thi
 Tendulkar said that it was the job of the off-field match officials to make the on-field umpires aware of the mistake

 Meanwhile, the three parties have intensified election campaigning in Punjab
 vahiin aam aadmi party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi punjab main deraa daal diya he
 If sources are to be believed, the Aam Aadmi Party will field almost all the ministers and mlas of Delhi in the urban areas of Punjab
 aam sutron kii maane to punjab ke shahari masalan pathankot, hoshiyarpur, jalandhar main jahaan gaiyr sikh matadaataaon kii taadaat zyada he, vahaan dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya, paryaton mantri kapil mishra, swasthya mantri satyendra jain or party ke varisht netaa kumaar vishwaas ko utaara jayega
 As many as 25 non-sikh and Hindu-dominated Punjab seats will not be a problem for the party, so AAP will field its Hindi-speaking faces in these areas
 isi ranneeti ke tahat mohali se party kevarisht netaa manish sisodiyane 10 janvari se party ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhali
 In this case, Sisodia said that while voting in Punjab, people should think that they are voting for Arvind Kejriwal, irrespective of who becomes the Chief Minister, it will be the responsibility of Arvind Kejriwal to get the work done
 aap sutron kii maane to party dilli main apane mantriyon or vidhayakon kii lagbhag 260 reliyaan punjab main karavaaegi
 In urban Punjab, where the Aam Aadmi Party feels that its position is not very good, these leaders will be fielded for small gatherings among the people, so that the Congress does not benefit from the Akali Dal's anti-incumbency
 vahiin aam aadmi party kaa daawa he ki kahin punjab kaa chunaav ko sikh banaam hindu naa ho jaae, isliye apane mantriyon or vidhayakon ko shahari hindu bahul ilaakon main party ke prachaar ke liye utaaregi
 Not only this, the chief of the party, Arvind Kejriwal, will also keep small meetings in view of short time in elections, instead of insisting on big rallies so that on average, more and more areas can be reached every day

 Now on this issue the Indian Army, intelligence agencies and the Ministry of External Affairs believe that this intrusion is a 'deliberate decision which was taken at a very high level
 ' The Indian Army has told the government that Chinese military commanders want the current deadlock to put forward a demand raised by former Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wenquan during an Indian visit in November last year
 chaing dwaara bharat se yah maang kii gai thi ki donon desh kii elesi par petrolingg yojana ko duusare paksh ko pehle hi bataanaa chahie
 At the same time, India opposed it because it suddenly stops the campaign to find out the activities of others

 Indian experts also believe that at this juncture, China also wants to send a message to India that the new power in Beijing, like its previous governments, accepts border disputes with India

 exparts kaa maananaa he ki pakistan lagaataar naakaami paane ke baad bhi duniya bhar main sikh samudaay ko bhadakaane se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 Ajay Sahni, executive director of the Delhi-based Institute of Conflict Management, asserted that Pakistan has no sympathy for the religious sentiments of Sikhs and that the neighboring country will use the Kartarpur corridor to achieve its intentions
 exparts ne pakistani khufia agency aisai par bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh rachane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki sikhon kaa vikaas kabhi bhi paak kii praathmik suchi main nahin he
 Sahni said, 'pakistan does not want to do good to Sikhs through Kartarpur
 ise pakistan charampanthi or aatankiyon ko lamaband karne ke hathiyaar ke taur par dekh rahaa he
 They are hoping that a large number of people will go to Pakistan and they will select some of them for their work
 yahi baat punjab congress ke pravaktaa ne bhi kahi he
 Raj Kumar Verka said that Pakistan is using the sentiments of Sikhs for its policy of breaking India

 The Chief Minister accused the Congress of hurling the Karnataka issue to quell the central government scams

 On the issue of illegal mining, he said that opposition Congress and JDS should be raised in the dock because they started it and looted it
 tata group se chairman sirus mistre ko hataane ke baad shuru hui bavaal thamata hua najar nahin aa rahaa
 At first Cyrus Mistry sent emails and accused the company of a loss of billions by accusing them of interfering with the decisions
 iske baad guuruuvaar ko tata sans ne apni safai pesh kii or sirus mistre par tabadatod aarope laga die
 The work was done in the statement issued by the group, saying that Cyrus Mistry has said that there is no freedom in decisions and in doing work, it is completely wrong and they have to work and take decisions in the interest of the company
 There was a discount
 haalanki, tata group kii apni ek samskruti he or pichley chairman ke kaarykaal main hamaari paramparaon or samskruti ko lekar kaaphi uthal-puthal dekhne ko mila
 Confidential information public Why is it said on behalf of the Kitat group that Kissiraeus Mistry made a confidential letter public
 ye garimapurna tarika nahin tha
 In this correspondence, baseless facts about the business of the Tata group have been laid
 iske saath hi tata sans board, samooh kii kai companiyon or sammanit logon ke khilaaf bebuniyaad aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Accused after the removal, the data group said that it is unfortunate that after the removal of Cyrus Mistry, allegations have been made about many decisions related to the business
 jab bhi in faislon ko lekar record saamne aaenge tab sari baaten saaf ho jaaengi
 Efforts are being made to falsely accuse the people and the corporate board of violating corporate governance rules, but these were continued even when the former chairman was assuming responsibility
 'bharosa banaae rakhane main naakaamayaab rahe'tata group ne kaha he ki ye durbhagyapurna he ki mi
 Mistry failed to maintain the confidence of the Board of Directors for several reasons
 bijness ke kai muddon par tata sans board kii ore se lagaataar chintaa jataai gai
 In addition, the trustees of the Tata Trusts also consistently raised the issue of increased antitrust but Mr
 mistre inkaa samaadhaan karne main safal nahin rahe
 After this, the Tata Sons board collectively took a decision to change its chairman
 ye faisla puri prakriya ke anuroop liya gaya
 Records will be placed on the right platform, the statement of the group said that it cannot be forgotten in any way that Mr
 mistre ne karmchaariyon kii nigaah main samooh kii chhavi ko kharaab karne kii koshish kii
 Confidential things were made public to justify a person's perspective
 company ke records ye dikhaate hai ki mi
 Mistry's allegations are baseless and these records will be kept on the right stage whenever needed
 18 july se shuru ho rahe monsoon satr main sarkaar ko gherne ke liye vipaksh ne apni taiyaari puri kar lee he
 On Monday, 13 opposition parties met just before the session began

 Along with this, opposition parties will also raise issues like mob lynching, Dalit oppression, atrocities against women
 yah to rahi vivaadon kii baat
 But if you look at the questions, the Opposition feels that in the last Parliamentary session, the Government through its allies organized protests and uproar and blamed the opposition for not running the Parliament properly
 isliye virdohi dalon ne tay kiya he ki is baar sansad nahin chali to jimmedaari sarkaar kii hogi or is lihaaj se vah lagaataar bayaanbaji bhi karenge, mudde bhi uthaaenge or apni baat bhi kahenge
 On this basis, the opposition parties decided that if the Parliament does not run in the future, there is a ruckus, then the responsibility should be put on the government
 sansad nahin chalane kii jimmedaari sarkaar kii hogi
 All the opposition parties agreed on this matter and decided that we want to debate on every issue
 udhaaharan pichley satr kaa diya gaya
 When the minister of the Telugu Desam Party, an ally of the government, was protesting

 With the arrival of Reliance Jio, smartphone users were quite excited
 5 sitambar se ise sabhi 4G smartfones ke liye lagu kar diya gaya he
 Under the welcome offer, its users are also being claimed to give unlimited 4G data calling by 31 December
 lekin dhire dhire log isse pareshaan hone lage hai
 These are the complaints of users from Reliance Jio, when we asked the opinion of people on the issue of problems coming in the Reliance Jio network, then about 70 users told that they were facing a lot of problems
 kai logon ne yah bhi bataaya he ki internet ab pehle jaisaa fast nahin, to kisi ne kaha ki internet to chal rahaa he lekin kol nahin ho rahi he
 Some people have said that they have taken SIM 20 days ago, but have not been activated yet
 logon kii yah bhi shikaayat he ki customer saport kaaphi ghatiya he
 Even after a long talk, the solution of the problem is not found
 haalanki inamen se kai yugers kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki yah free he to hamen koi shikaayat nahin honi chahie, jab paise dene honge to shikaayat karenge
 Now we tell you that if you have live, then you can face these problems

 In such a situation, the internet runs very slow
 wais kol kii samasya:kai log maheene bhar se jeeyo sim se internet to chalaa rahe hai lekin usase ek baar bhi kol nahin kiya he
 The reason is that it does not call anyone
 kol lag jaae to bhi wais quality kaaphi badtar he
 Although app to app calling is slightly better than this, but for this a smartphone with volte on both sides is necessary
 sim card kaam nahin kar rahaa he!5 sitambar ke baad se company ke mutabaki jeeyo simsbhi 4G smartphone main chalegaa
 But for many, it is not so
 4G divaais hone ke baad bhi sim kaam nahin kar rahaa he

 team india ke captain kool emes dhonine saal 2014 ke ant mentest cricket se sanyas kii ghoshnakar sabko chaunkaa diya
 Team director Ravi Shastri himself was also surprised by this decision
 haalanki unhone sanket die hai ki jarurat padane par dhoni sidney test khel sakate hai
 In an interview given to Cricinfo, Ravi Shastri said that all of us were 'stumped' by Dhoni's decision to retire from Test cricket
 unhone kaha, 'dhoni ke is faisle ke bare main kisi ko nahin pataa tha
 We did not know when Dhoni returned from the post match (melbourne Test) presentation
 vahaan se lautakar usne mujhase baat kii or phir saathi khilaadiyon se
 He did not even talk to his family about the decision
 'shastri ne kaha, 'sanyas kaa faisla kisi bhi khilaadi ke liye bahut nijee hota he
 But a good player knows when to retire
 ' shastri se jab poocha gaya ki kya wo dhoni ke faisle se sahamat hai to unhone jawaab diya, 'isamen koi shaq nahin ki yah faisla sabake liye apratyaashit tha lekin yah himmat bharaa faisla tha
 Dhoni did not wait for 100 Test matches or any other record
 unhen koi dhoomdhaam vaala ferewel nahin chaahate the
 It shows their character, they are different
 'jab shastri se poocha gaya ki dhoni agar captaini se pareshaan the to khilaadi ke taur par 100 test khilne kaa intjaar kar sakate the
 On this, Shastri said, 'dhoni felt that he was not able to do justice to himself and the team
 iske liye unka sammaan hona chahie naa ki unke faisle par shaq karnaa chahie
 When Shastri was asked that the growing influence of Virat Kohli and your full support of him is also a reason for Dhoni's Test retirement, he said, 'I heard this nonsense too, but it is just nonsense
 'dhoni or viraat ke bich matbhed kii khabaron par shastri ne kaha, 'aap logon ko iskaa andaja nahin ki dhoni kii aguwai kaa kitna sammaan he
 Not just for Virat but for the entire team
 saport staff or prashasan sabhi dhoni kaa sammaan karte hai
 About Dhoni's stay in the team, Shastri said, "he will remain in Australia but not with the team
" ' unase jab poocha gaya ki aisi khabare hai ki dhoni riddhimaan saaha ke standby honge to unhone kaha, 'bilkul, agar jarurat padi to
 
 
 Commenting on Dhoni's Test career, the former cricketer said, "it has been debated that he (dhoni) was not a legendary cricketer but in my eyes he was no less than anyone
" 'shastri se jab poocha gaya ki dhoni naram the to viraat garam aise main kya khilaadiyon ko mushkil ho sakati he to is par unka jawaab tha, 'mere samay main main kai captainon ke andar khel chukaa hum, unamem se koi bhi captain ek jaise nahin the
 The captain has his own personality and those who are the best, teach the players to follow their thinking and approach
 'shastri ne bataaya ki shikhar dhawan or viraat kohli ke bich koi bahes nahin hui thi
 Let me tell you that Virat has played with the team for almost five years and some players have also played with him in the Under-19 team
 shastri se jab poocha gaya ki aapane kohli kii aakraamakata kii tarif kii he, lekin aapako nahin lagata ki mishael johnson ke saath vah zyada provocative ho rahe hai, to is par team diarector kaa jawaab tha, 'yah uski persenality he, wo aakraamak, pashnet he
 You should not forget that she is 26 years old

 They start generating garbage to muddy the Sutlej

 The drain at Ludhiana is not closed

 The first drain drained the old river
 ab vah budha naala kehalaata he
 One day it will turn the Sutlej into a drain

 The names of the schemes are changing

 To die from cancer is to become a minister

 Even though 6 days have passed since the Asian Games started, the team of All India Radio covering the Games is waiting to go to Incheon
 akashwani khelon kii khabar, internet or tivi dekhakar de rahaa he
 Actually, every time the team of AIR used to broadcast the Asian Games live radio, but this time the whole matter got stuck due to negligence and thousands of sports lovers of the country had to be bereft of the thrill of the live telecast of the games
 sutron ke anusaar akashwani ne inchion asian games ke liye 25 logon kii team bheje jane kaa prastaav khelon se sirf 1 din pehle diya
 Although the schedule of the Asian Games was announced months ago, the proposal was sent by All India Radio on 17 September while the games started on 19 September
 akashwani kii ye deree jaise kaaphi nahi thi
 It is being told that this proposal is still pending
 adhikariyon ke anusaar akashwani ne pehle 1
 a budget of 5 crores was made, which was received more by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 mantralay ne 25 logon kii is list ko ghataakar 11 kar diya
 All India Radio, responsible for airing the Games ending on October 4, is still in waiting mode
 kharch ghataane kii kavayad main comenttator is daure kaa (agar ho paaya to) hissaa nahin honge
 The government had already deposited some amount as advance booking of the hotels, which obviously went waste
 akashwani ke diarector general epa shehryaar is maamle par kuch bolne ko uplabdh nahin the vahiin diarector(khel) rajeev shukla ne koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya

 saleem khan un chand kalakaaron main hai jinhen lambey vakt se industry main khub sammaan miltaa aayaa he
 In terms of strong personality and beauty, he is far ahead of his son Salman Khan
 saleem khan ne acting se apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii
 But he once met Javed Akhtar
 phir kya tha ban gai bollywood kii sabase mashhoor or safal script riter kii jodi
 Today is the birthday of Salim Khan, the father of Bollywood's Dabangg Khan Salman Khan
 70 or 80 ke dashak kii mashhoor jodi saleem-javed ke saleem khan ke bare main aaiye jaanate hai kuch rochak baaten
 Salim Khan was born on 24 November 1935 in Indore

 Salim Khan was seen by the then director Amarnath during a wedding and called Mumbai and gave Salim Khan a chance to act on a salary of 400 rupees a month
 actor ke taur par saleem khan ne lagbhag 14 filmein kin
 These include films like 3rd Floor, Deewana, Loyal, Sarhadi Lootera
 in filmon main saleem ne chote-mote role play kiye
 This was the reason that as an actor he could not attract much attention of the audience

 Of course, when the owner of the jewelery shop woke up in the morning, the earnings of grinding had become the silver of another world
 na koi suraakh, na hi koi bhul
 The police did not understand anything, but then the CCTV camera outside the shop opened all the secrets

 But it was stolen and millions worth of goods were missing
 chori kii yah daastaan kuch aise shuru hoti he
 Around 2 pm, 6 women gather one by one outside the KD Silver Jewelery showroom in Trinagar

 The remaining four women were now behind the shawl
 shawl ke peeche hi duusari mahilaayein showrooms kaa taala tod detii hai
 After this, one of the women teaches the shutter lightly upwards and enters the shop from below
 baaki mahilaayein showrooms ke paas se khisak jaati hai
 Once again everyone is deserted
 aise jaise kuch hua hi nahin
 After entering the shop, the woman extracts the torch and then steals gold and silver and diamonds kept in the shop
 mahila chor itmeenaan se dukaan ke andar chori karti he or saamaan ko ek plastic ke bag main rakhti jaati he
 She also assimilates the cash placed on the other side of the shop
 8 minute baad saathiyon kaa sathlady chorni dukaan ke andar kareeb 8 minute tak chori karti he
 She then approaches the shutter and waits for the gesture of her companions
 kareeb 2 minute baad use kuch aawaaj sunai detii he or vah teji se plastic ke bag main jewelery lekar shater ke baahar nikal jaati he
 The whole group exists outside and all of them disappear in the darkness of night

 This is a farmers' letter written to the President, Prime Minister and Secretary of Agriculture
 2016-17 ke liye masul daal kaa samarthan mulya 3950 rupee prati quintal tha
 The support price for 2017-18 has been fixed at Rs 4250 per quintal, but there is no buyer at this price
 jo baat patrakaron ko pataa nahin wo kisaanon ko maaloom he ki pradhanmantri kab mozambik gaye, kab daalon par aayaat shulk shunya hua, kab se unka daal baahar janaa band ho gaya or daam gir gaya
 Dal farmers say that the Bihar government too did not pay attention to buying pulses
 unhen bazaar se daam mil ja rahaa tha, isliye abhi tak sarkaar kii jarurat nahin thi magar ab jab sarkaar kii taraf dekh rahe hai, pataa nahin chal rahaa he ki kya ho rahaa he
 We talked to Omprakash ji on the phone and wanted to understand what is the economics of his farming
 unhone jo samajhaayaa wo is tarah he
 Last year, 80 bighas of land was leased for pulses cultivation
 10,000 rupee prati bigha ke hisaab se 80 bigha kaa kiraaya hua 8 lakh
 This money had to be paid in October only after taking interest from the moneylenders
 80 bighas main daal kii buvaai ke liye ek lakh kaa beej laga, baaki kharchaa alag
 Due to non-payment, they sold pulses 7
 5 lakh hi nikaal sake hai
 That is, they could not even extract the cost byaaj kaa paisa alag dena padaa
 Late sowing also reduced the yield in Hathia Nakshatra
 isse ghate kaa antar or bad gaya
 Omprakash ji said that in 2016-17, pulses were sold at the rate of 7200 per quintal, then earned a lot of money but since then they are selling at a loss only
 sarkaar kaa daam 4250 rupee prati quintal he
 3200 rupees per quintal is not going to buy in the market
 kisaanon kii daalen khule khet main padi hai
 Grain is also wasted due to rain
 storage kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 a farmer told that earlier farmers used to stock for two to three months but has stopped stocking due to GST
 kabhi kabhaar sthaneey vyapaaree kharidne aate bhi hai to daam bahut kam dete hai
 Traders are forced to sell at the price they give
 aap in kisaanon kii haalat dekhie, inkaa sharir hi bataa rahaa he ki mehnat kaa fal kitna mila hoga
 Statistics show that even though the support price for this year is 4250 per quintal, farmers are forced to sell around the support price of Rs 2950 per quintal for 2013-14
 yani laagat aaj ke bhav se or kamai chaar saal pehle ke bhav se

 The year 2017 was very important for the country's tax policy
 is saal na sirf nai tex niti guds and sarvice tex (jiesti) ko lagu kiya gaya, balki isamen kai badlaav bhi kiye gaye
 Modi government reduced the rate of many products to give relief to the common man under GST
 kaarobaariyon ke liye bhi rifund clem karne kaa kaam aasaan kar diya gaya he
 In the new year GST will work to provide relief to the common man as well as the economy of the country
 agle saal jahaan jiesti parishad petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laana tay mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, it is also expected to emerge from the side effects of GST in the new year of the economy
 aage jaaniye naye saal main jiesti aapke liye kya tohfe laa sakati he
 Petrol and diesel will be cheaper
 In the new year, GSTM can give cheap petrol and diesel gifts to the man
 guuruuvaar ko bihar ke vitt mantri susheel modi ne bhi is ore sanket kiya
 This year, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis were voiced to bring petrol and diesel under GST
 in netaaon ne kaha ki petrol or dijal ke badhate daamon par lagaam kasne ke liye jiesti hi ekmaatr rasta he
 Sushil Modi says that next year electricity can also come under the purview of GST
 sabhi rajya raji, bas sahi vakt kaa he intjaoctober maheene menmaharashtra ke vitt mantri sudhir munagatiwarane kaha tha ki sabhi rajyon ne petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane kii anumati de di he
 According to him, now we have to wait for the right time to bring these products under it
 ummid jataai ja rahi thi ki jiesti parishad kii 23veen baithak main isko lekar koi faisla liya ja saktaa he, lekin aisa hua nahin
 Petrol will be 45 rupees per liter
 Now it is expected that in the year GST council will include petrol and diesel in GST
 agar aisa hota he, to aapako ek litre petrol kareeb 45 rupee main mil sakegaa
 The price of diesel is also likely to be around this
 darasal jiesti ke tahat aane se kachche tel kii lagaataar badhati keemton kaa asar kam kiya ja sakegaa
 Buy a house will be cheaper Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that real estate can be brought under the purview of GST
 susheel modi ne bhi is baat ko doharaaya he
 According to Jaitley, this will not only help the common man to buy a cheaper house, but it will also help in curbing tax evasion
 kar chori par lagegi lagamjetli ke mutabik sabase zyada kar chorerial estate kshetramen hi hoti he
 If it is brought under the purview of GST, then tax evasion can be controlled to a great extent
 is par bhi jiesti parishad kii 23veen baithak main faisla liye jane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi thi, lekin aisa hua nahin
 After this, it is decided to bring real estate under GST in the new year
 tex slab honge kamane vaale naye saal mengsti ke tahat tex slabko ghataakar sirf do par hi simit kiya jayega
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that in the next meeting of the GST Council, the existing 5 tax slabs can be limited to 2 only
 unhone sanket die ki 28 fisadi tex slab ko khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Only 12 and 18 per cent tax slabs can be replaced instead
 vahiin, susheel modi ne kaha he ki 28 fisadi tex slab kii jagah 25 fisadi adhiktam slab rahegaa
 If this happens, many of the products included in the 28 per cent can be cheap for you
 jiesti parishad agali baithak main kai utpaadon kaa jiesti rate bhi kam kar sakati he
 Many other products are also expected to provide relief to the common man
 kaarobaariyon ke liye hogi raah aasansti ke tahat input tex credit lene main kaarobaariyon ko kai dikkatein pesh aa rahi hai
 There are still many complications regarding GST in the minds of small businessmen
 unhen jiesti ritern bharne main dikkatein pesh aa rahi hai
 To find a solution to all these problems, the government is constantly bringing new things
 haal hi main sarkaar ne jiestn network par ofline tul jari kiya he
 All the work will be online, with the help of this offline tool, businessmen will be able to easily keep track of their entire business and the GST imposed on it
 iske alaava sarkaar lagaataar jiesti ritern or rifund bharne main yuj kiye jane vaale forms bhi kam karegi
 Other processes including GST refunds are also planned to be done online
 agle saal is morche par sarkaar teji se kaam kar sakati he
 Other international institutions, including Morgan Stanley, IMF and World Bank, have been continuously saying that the new year will prove to be better for the Indian economy
 morgan stanley kii maane to agle saal jidipi kii vruddhi dar 7
 Can reach 5 percent
 isi tarah vishwa bank or imef samet anya sansthaaon ne bhi aglaa saal notebandi or jiesti ke asar ko khatm karne vaala bataaya he

 jab kisaanon ko yah baat puri tarah samaj main aa jaaegi to is samasya kaa samaadhaan kuch had tak apane aap ho jayega
 He claimed that the farmer of Haryana has understood that burning stubble is not in his interest
 dhankhad ne bataaya ki hamaare kheton main jeevansh kii maatra ghatati ja rahi he or khaad kii maatra badhati ja rahi he
 If this continues, then the day is not far when our fields will become barren
 isse bachanaa he to hamen paraali se tauba kerani hi hogi
 He also said that the reason for increasing pollution is not just stubble

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has made a big announcement about electricity on Thursday afternoon
 dilli main ab 200 unit tak bijli muft main muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 That is, if you use up to 200 units of electricity, then you will not have to pay any money
 arvind kejariwal ke is elaan ko agle saal rajya main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se joda ja rahaa he or bada master stroke bataaya ja rahaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal's decision will benefit large number of people living in Delhi
 kyonki dilli sarkaar ke ek bayaan ke mutabik, rajya main 91 fisadi log sarkaar kii sabsidi kaa upyog karte hai
 Out of this, about 67 percent are people who use 0 to 200 units of electricity
 200 se 400 unit tak bijli kaa istemaal karne waalon kii sankhya 24 fisadi he
 How many people in Delhi consume 200 units of power or less? a whopping 32 lakh or 2 / 3rd of all houses will now get Zero Bill starting next month

 Let us tell you that even before the decision to free 200 units in Delhi, DERC also reduced the fix charge in Delhi
 DERC ke faisle ke mutabik, 2KW tak pehle 125 rupee kaa fiks charge dena hota tha lekin ab sirf 20 rupee kaa hi fiks charge dena hoga
