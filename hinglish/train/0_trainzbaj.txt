 bihar main pichley 24 ghante ke andar chotii katane ke do maamle or uttarakhand se bhi ek maamla saamne aayaa he
 After Rajasthan, delhi-ncr, MP and UP, now the names of Bihar and Uttarakhand have also been included in the list of states associated with these incidents
 pehali ghatana bihar ke motihaari jile kii he
 a girl named Radhika was sleeping outside the house last night
 usee bich rahasyamay tareeke se uski chotii cat gai
 In the morning, Radhika saw her peak cut off and started shouting

 The second incident occurred in Muzaffarpur district, where an elderly woman was sleeping in the courtyard of her house at night
 pehali ghatana kii hi tarah bujurg mahila kii chotii bhi raat main cat gai
 After waking up in the morning, the elderly woman told her family about this
 ghatana ke baad se mahila kaa parivaar behad khaufjada he
 a case of felling of a girl named Farzana has also been reported in Sahaspur of Uttarakhand
 beeti raat lagbhag 12 baje farjaana kii cheekh sunakar gharavaalon kii aankh khul gai
 When the family reached Farzana, he saw that his severed peak was lying on the bed

 In view of the proposed Jan Akanksha rally of the Congress at the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the capital of Bihar, many political meanings are being drawn for the involvement of Bahubali Independent MLA Anant Singh in the party's roadshow
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan jab argedy-jediu-congress gathbandhan main chunaav lade the, tab anant singh kii dabangai or hinsa ko mudda banaakar argedy pramukh lalu yadav ne unhen jediu chhodane par majaboor kar diya tha
 In such a situation, due to his open involvement in the Congress program before the Lok Sabha elections, the knot of the proposed grand alliance in Bihar may become loose
 congress ke road sho main shaamil hue anantbihar congress cameti dwaara patna main yojit road sho main anant singh pradesh congress chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh or rajyasabha sadsy akhilesh prasad singh ke saath unke vaahan main savaar dikhe
 Actually Anant Singh Moger, an independent MLA from Mokama, wants to contest from Lok Sabha seat and he is claiming to contest on Congress ticket
 mana ja rahaa he ki yahaan se bihar ke ek or bahubali or purv saansad surajbhaan singh algepi ke tikat par chunavi taal thok sakate hai
 Please tell that Surajbhan and Anant Singh are considered to be bitter opponents of each other
 haalanki congress ke road sho main anant singh se shaamil hone par bihar congress adhyaksh madan mohan jha ne kaha ki koi bhi vyakti agar party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke netritv main aasthaa vyakt karata he to isamen koi aapatti nahin he
 But as far as joining the party and ticketing is concerned, its decision will be decided by the high command
 vahiin argedy netaa tejasvi yadav pehle hi kah chuke hai ki mahagathbandhan main anant singh ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Other Dabangg also in contact with Congress, recently, Lovely Anand, wife of Dabang Anand Mohan of Bihar, has joined Congress Party
 iske alaava vaishali se algepi saansad or dabang rama singh bhi congress ke sampark main bataae ja rahe hai
 At the same time Pappu Yadav, MP from Madhepura, is also constantly in touch with the Congress
 jabaki unki patni ranjita ranjan pehle se hi congress kii saansad hai
 The RJD does not want to give Pappu Yadav a place in the coalition at any cost
 vaise bhi gathbandhan kii surat main argedy chaahegi kii madhepura seat se sharad yadav ko chunaav ladaaya jaae, jahaan se ve ab tak chunaav ladate aae hai
 Pappu Yadav is a leader of a domineering image and is opposed to RJD chief Lalu Yadav
 savarna aarakshan par congress-argedy kaa stand alagapichley kuch dinon ke ghatnakram par najar daalen to argedy or congress ek duusare ke stand ko lekar chintit hai
 The RJD openly protested in Parliament on the issue of 10 per cent reservation for the poor of the general caste
 lekin congress ne donon sadanon main is vidheyak kaa samarthan kiya
 At the same time, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav himself met Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati after announcing the alliance of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh
 savarna vot par congress kii najarasutron ke mutabik bihar main congress party savarnon ke vot apane paksh main karne ke liye puri takat jhonke hue hai
 It is believed that many upper caste leaders can join the Congress before the Lok Sabha elections
 bihar ke bahubali netaaon ke alaava jin anya naamon kii charchaa he, unamem purniya se bijepi ke purv saansad udai singh or darbhanga se saansad kirti aaazaad bhi congress ke sampark main hai
 Let us know that former MP Uday Singh, who has been angry with the BJP for a long time, recently resigned from the primary membership of the party
 mana ja rahaa he ki 3 janvari ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii patna main hone vaali raily main udai singh shaamil ho sakate hai
 So Poonam Jha Azad, wife of Kirti Azad, has already joined the Congress party
 siton par abhi nahin bani sahmatigauratlab he ki bihar main mahagathbandhan ke dalon ke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa abhi nahin ho paaya hai
 Last time, RJD contested 27 seats out of 40 seats in Bihar, Congress on 12 and NCP on 1 seat
 lekin isbaar gathbandhan main argedy or congress se alaava upendra kushvaha kii araspi, mukesh saahani kii party nishad vikaas sangh, jithan ram maanjhi kii party hindustan awam morcha, left or sharad yadav kii party bhi shaamil he
 According to sources, RJD wants to contest 20 seats and is willing to leave the remaining seats to Congress and other allies
 aise main adhik sahyogi dalon ke shaamil hone se congress ko milane vaali siton main hi katautee kii ja sakati he

 The Congress has launched a scathing attack on the Modi government over the cabinet reshuffle
 congress netaa mallikargen khadge ne kaha ki wo kya saal 2019 kii taiyaari main hai yaa 2022 kii, wo jaane, wo mantriyon ko power hi nahin dete hai
 All things are run by the PMO and its officials
 sidhe mantralay ke adhikari unako report karte hai
 The minister does not have power
 sari takat piemo ke paas he, to mantrimandal main badlaav se kya phayda?loksabhaa main congress netaa khadge ne kaha ki bijepi apane logon par vishwaas karke janata ke liye kaam nahin kar rahi he
 Except the road, discrimination is being done in other places and schemes

 Governments and mps of opposing parties are not listened to in relief operations in flooded areas
 bijepi shasit rajyon ko or unke saansadon ko tarjeeh di jaati he
 The Congress leader said that the PM changed his right to the Railway Minister, but what would happen if the Minister did not have the power? Ministers have to look to the PMO for everything
 isse kya phayda? anant hegade par hamaari party ke netaa manish tiwari pehle hi pratikriya de chuke hai
 Kharge said that the cabinet means Modi
 
 
 naa charchaa hoti he
 
 
 There is no proposal

 He said that Modi has failed in all matters including clean India, demonetisation, unemployment and talks about New India

 to kya musiibat tab tak landan aa chuki thi? do din pehle kii takanic kii duniya kii sabase badi khabar thi 'huavei par google kaa pratibandh'
 This action was taken by Google after the US administration blacklisted this Chinese company which banned the hardware or software exports of American companies to the companies involved
 alabatta, jin phone main ye hardware yaa software pehle se hai, ve chalate rahenge or unhen apadet bhi miltaa rahegaa
 Other companies such as Intel, Qualcomm and ARM have also stopped supplies to Huawei
 america pratibandh (baad main 90 dinon ke liye taal die gaye) us chintaa kii upaj hai ki chini sarkaar se huavei kii kareebi kii vajah se uske upkarnon kaa jasusi main istemaal hone kii ashanka he
 Huawei has denied the allegations
 phir bhi pratibandh se huavei puri tarah se khatm ho sakati he
 It now has the option to use only the initial open-source Android with which apps from Play Store, Google Maps, youtube or Mail will not work
 huavei 2018 se apni ap gailaree bhi viksit kar rahi thi, lekin ve ap bharat yaa shesh duniya ke liye bahut kaam ke nahin hai
 With this ban, Google will also lose about $ 400 million annually in terms of licenses and other charges
 european union main dhokhadhadi ke aaropon par 1
 This is not a big loss for Google, a $ 100 billion company that fined $ 7 billion
 phir bhi, isse google or america ke liye bade khatre paidaa ho sakate hai
 First, Asian smartphone makers are concerned with Google's take on the market
 duniya bhar ke sabhi smartphonon main se 75 pratishat android aadhaarit hai or tunakmizaaj donald trump kaa vyapaar-yuddh missile jaise hamalon ke liye taiyaar baithe rahanaa in nirmaataaon ke liye mushkil paidaa karata he
 Huawei is no small fish
 2018 main isane lagbhag 20 karod smartphone kaa niryaat karte hue samsung ke baad duusare number ke smartphone nirmaataa ke rup main apple ko peeche chhod diya tha
 After the ban, Apple will again come in second place
 duusare ki chini samrajya bhi javaabi hamalaa karegaa
 China may formally ban Apple
 haalanki is ke bare main huavei ke sansthaapak or siio rain jengphei ne kaha he ki ve aisi sthiti kaa virodh karenge kyonki apple hi unki guru he, china main anaupchaarik rup se apple kaa bahishkaar hone laga he or bahut se chini graahak apane apple phone chini nirmaataaon ke phone se badal rahe hai
 The ban on Huawei will also have an impact on India, whose Android dominates the smartphone market
 saal kii shuruyaat main huavei ne bharat ke liye agle teen saal main 10 karod dollar ke nivesh ke saath sthaneey str par nirmaan yojana kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Huawei's telecommunications equipment business is also at stake
 america anya deshon par huavei ke upkarnon par pratibandh lagane kaa dabaav daalata rahaa he
 Japan and Australia have also been banned
 is kshetra main huavei ko china kii hi jedtii ke alaava europe kii nokia or arikson kaa muqabla karnaa hota he
 Both European companies also import equipment parts from China
 bhartiya afasaron kaa maananaa he ki huavei ko auron se alag karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Germany and Britain have resisted American pressure
 bhartiya doorsanchaar sachiv ne sitambar main bataaya tha ki sambhav he ki huavei ko 5ji takanic ke pareekshanon ke liye aamantrit na kiya jaae
 Nevertheless, India will continue to use the devices made by Huawei
 bharat ko is ladaai main saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 India is testing its protectionist stance: Processing of data related to storage and payment has been made mandatory in the country
 bharat doorsanchaar network upkarnon—routeron, base steshnon, antina or multiplexrs kaa 90 pratishat yani kareeb 22 arab dollar (2017-18) aayaat karata he
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority says that India should manufacture such 'strategic importance' devices
 1994 main huavei ke sansthaapak kaa ek bayaan charchit hua tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki doorsanchaar upkarnon kaa sambandh rashtriya suraksha se he or iske bina koi raashtra aisa hi he jaise uske paas apni sena na ho
 The same statement can now increase their difficulty

 The woman did not stop here, she threw the severed head of the husband into a drain near the house
 jabaki laash ke baaki tukade apane ghar main gaddha khodakar dafna die
 This creepy tale of murder was written on Valentine's Day
 darasal, saal 2006 main uttar pashchimi dilli main rahane vaale 50 saal ke rajesh ne apni umr se aadhi yani 25 saal kii sunita ke saath shaadi kii thi
 a year after their marriage, a son was born in their home
 yahaan tak to sab thik tha
 But the real trouble started when his family shifted to a new house last year
 vahaan sunita kii dosti pados main rahane vaale ek ladke ke saath ho gai
 Rajesh once saw his wife in an objectionable position with the boy
 iske alaava ek or ghatana aisi ghati jisase halaat or kharaab hue
 Sunita's mother had come to his house shortly before, which Rajesh did not like
 vah sunita kii maa ko stesan chhodane gaye lekin vah ghar nahin pahunchi
 Sunita felt that her mother was killed by Rajesh
 jab is rishte ko bachaane ke saare raste band ho gaye to usne raat-din krime serials dekhne shuru kar die
 She started looking for ways to get rid of her husband
 or iske baad sunita ne ek khaufnak sajeesh rachi
 Which he did on the day of Valentine's Day, Sunita performed her dangerous plans
 sunita ne apane pati ke drink main baari maatra main dardanaashak goliyaan mila di, jisase rajesh kii maut ho gai
 After this he started cutting Rajesh's corpse into pieces
 do ghante main usne laash ko 8 tukdon main kaat daalaa
 Then he dug a pit in the empty space outside his house and buried the remaining pieces of corpse in it and stuffed his head in a plastic bag and threw it into the drain near Bhalswa Dairy
 jabaki laash ke pairon ko ek anya jagah par gaddha khodakar dafna diya
 Then, coming back home, he cleaned the blood and erased the evidence of murder
 yojana ke mutabik do din baad sunita police stesan pahunchi or apane pati ke gumshuda hone kii report darj karai
 For some time the neighbors also asked about Rajesh, then they also calmed down
 is ghatana ke kuch samay baad police ko ek sada-galaa sir baraamad hua
 Which led to police alert
 kahani main twist pichley hafte aayaa
 When his landlord came to Sunita's house and inquired seeing the repair work there
 lekin sunita iskaa santoshjanak jawaab nahin de pai
 After some time, the landlord returned and returned to where the sand and spice was
 use hataakar dekha
 He was stunned to see the fingers coming out of him
 iske baad usne ret ko or hataaya to puraa haath najar aane laga
 The landlord immediately informed the police
 police forensik team lekar maukey par ja pahunchi
 Police suspect Rajesh's wife Sunita
 lihaaja usase sakhti se poochtacha kii gai
 Meanwhile, Sunita broke down
 usne police ke samaksh apana gunaah kubul kar liya
 Sunita told the police that there was no relation between them for a year
 baat talaak tak pahunch gai thi
 Fed up with her husband's anger and beatings, she carried out the murder incident
 philhal police ne sunita ko jail bhej diya he
 While his son is kept in a child home
 bhartiya bharottolak phir doping vivaad main funs gayi jab 53 kigra varg kii bharottolak sanamcha chanu pichley maheene hue nadaa ke dope test main pajitive pai gayi
 India has already survived an international ban due to which it could have deprived it of participation in the Commonwealth Games
 desh kii sabase safal mahila bharottolkon main shumaar chanu pratibandhit padaarth mithailhexaniamine ke liye pajitive pai gai hai jo 2004 athens olympic main pakade jane ke baad unka doosraa aparaadh he
 Now if Chanu's 'B' sample is also found positive and she fails to prove her innocence before the NADA appellate panel, then she could be banned for life

 a top source said, 'yes, Chanu has been found to be positive for methylhexaniamine
 ‘bi’ namoonay kaa pareekshan or nadaa ke apil panel ke samaksh pesh hona un par nirbhar karata he
 Sahadev Yadav, secretary of the Indian Weightlifting Federation, said that a weightlifter has been found positive for the banned substance but it is not in the Commonwealth Games squad announced last month
 yadav ne kaha, ‘ek bharottolak pajitive paaya gaya he lekin niyamon ke mumutabik ‘bi’ namoonay kaa nateeja nahin aane tak ham naam kaa khulaasa nahin kar sakate
 The result of the 'B' sample is expected by Monday
 lekin main kah saktaa hum ki yah bharottolak rashtramandal khelon kii team main shaamil nahin he
 The Indian Weightlifting Association recently paid a fine of five million dollars to the international body after six weightlifters were implicated in Wada's dope test in September last year
 desh ke bharottolkon ko tabhi agle maah hone vaale rashtramandal khelon main hissaa lene kii sweekruti mili jab rashtramandal aayojan samiti ne bhartiya bharottolan sangh ko 1
 He gave an interest-free loan of Rs 75 crore, by which he paid the remaining two installments of a five million dollar fine by 31 August
 manipur kii yah athlete bhi usee mithailhexaniyamine ke liye pajitive pai gai hai jo pichley kuch samay se vivaad ke centre main he kyonki pichley ek hafte main 11 athlete isi padaarth ke liye pajitive paye gayi hai
 This substance is present in food supplements

 Pratima Kumari (63 kg) was also found guilty of doping and both were banned for two years while the Indian Weightlifting Federation was banned for one year
 bharat ne 26 / 11 ke mukhya aaropee jacki-ur-rahamaan lakhvi ko jamaanat die jane par gahari chintaa vyakt kii he
 The Foreign Ministry said this made fun of Pakistan's commitment to fight against terrorism
 mantralay ke pravaktaa saiyad akbaruddin ne shuukravaar ko kaha, lakhvi ko di gai jamaanat pakistan kii aatankwaadi sanghathan ke khilaaf ladane kii patibaddhta kaa majaak bana degaa
 Talking to reporters of the television channel, the spokesperson said that Pakistan's investigation on the Mumbai attack was proceeding at a very slow pace and added another such link to the bail granted to Lakhvi on Thursday
 unhone kaha, kai aashwasano ke baavjood hamane aatankwaad nirodhi adaalat main saaton aropiyon ke khilaaf sunwaayee or mumbai hamale ke shadyantra ke khilaaf chal rahi jaanch kii raftaar dhimi dekhi he
 The frequent suspensions, postponement and non-availability of the relevant legal authorities and witnesses are proof of this and need not be repeated
 unhone kaha, lakhvi ko guuruuvaar ko jamaanat dena is silsile ko or aage le gaya he
 We have expressed our concern over this matter and conveyed to Pakistan the feeling of India that it would make fun of Pakistan's commitment to fight against terrorism
 islamabad kii ek adaalat ne guuruuvaar ko lakhvi ko jamaanat de di, jo saat anya ke saath 26 / 11 hamale kaa aaropee he
 166 people were killed and several others were injured in the incident
 mana jaataa he ki hamale ke vakt lakhvi pratibandhit sanghathan eliti kaa sanchaalan pramukh tha
 Reacting to the bail granted to Lakhvi on Thursday, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, "it is unfortunate and i believe it should not have happened
" unhone kaha ki pakistan sarkaar ko ucch nyaayalay main apil karnaa chahie
 The Foreign Ministry also reacted strongly, saying that bail to Lakhvi is like assuring the terrorists who committed the heinous crime
 mantralay ne pakistan se aatankwaad nirodhi adaalat ke is faisle ke khilaaf tatkaal kadam uthaane kii maang kii
 It said, given the scale of recent attacks in Pakistan, it is reasonable to realize that there can be no compromise with terrorists

 yadi 38 saal ke sachin tendulkar, sadabahaar virendra sahvaag or 22 saal ke viraat kohli ko chhod diya jaae, to ipel ke pradarshan ko dekhakar lagata he ki mahendra singh dhoni or vishwa champion team ke unke kuch saathiyon par lagaataar cricket khilne se thakaan kaa asar padane laga he
 Dhoni was already upset with the busy schedule of the Indian cricket team and said that this could have an impact on the performance of the players
 ab ipel main kai khilaadiyon ke pradarshan ko dekhakar lagata he ki un par westeindies daure se pehle hi thakaan haaavee hoti ja rahi he
 The IPL will end on May 28 and the Indian team will leave for the West Indies on June 1, where they will play one Twenty20, five odis and three Test matches from June 4
 bhartiya khilaadiyon ko pichley paanch maheene se vishram kaa samay nahin mila or aise main kuch varisht khilaadiyon ko carabian daure main vishram diya ja saktaa he
 Leaving Tendulkar, Kohli, Sehwag and to a lesser extent Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir, members of the world champion team like captain Dhoni, Suresh Raina, big hitter Yusuf Pathan, fast bowlers Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth and spinners Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla
 So far, they have not performed as expected in the IPL
 tendulkar ne umr or vyastata ko phir se maat dekar ipel main joardaar pradarshan kiya or is twanti-20 toornament ke aadha safar tak adhiktar samay sarvaadhik ran banane vaale ballebaaj ko milane vaali orange cap pahane rakhi
 Tendulkar has scored 276 runs in seven matches so far, including a century and a half-century
 dhoni ne haal main kaha tha, aap shaareerik pahalu se nibat sakate ho, lekin jitani cricket kheli ja rahi he, usase aapaki maansik or bhaavnaatmak sthiti kamjor pad sakati he
 He was also supported by Yuvraj Singh, the hero of India's World Cup victory, but Sehwag did not agree with his captain
 vishwa cap ke chah din baad shuru hue ipel main pradarshan ko dekhakar lagata he ki kahin vastav main dhoni par cricket kii thakaan to haaavee nahin ho rahi he
 Dhoni scored only 137 runs in the first 7 matches, with his highest score being 43 runs
 unki team ke saathi raina ne bhi itane hi match khele jisamen unke naam par 153 ran darj hai
 Raina holds the record for most runs in the IPL, but he has achieved this feat on the basis of good performance in the first three tournaments
 yuvaraj ne vishwa cap main balle or gend donon se kamaal dikhaaya tha
 In the IPL too, he has tried to maintain his form but it seems that he is under pressure from the other side not to cooperate, allowing him to score 232 runs in the first 7 matches and take only 4 wickets
 ye chaaron wicket unhone dilli ke khilaaf ek match main liye the
 Talking about the bowlers, Bengaluru have been disappointed with their main bowler Zaheer, who has taken only 7 wickets in 7 matches
 inamen se teen wicket unhone deccan chargers ke khilaaf ek match main liye the
 His economy rate of 7 / 27 is also not impressive
 harbhajan ko mumbai indians se kaaphi ummiden thim, lekin unhen 6 match main 7 wicket liye hai or ahm baat yah he ki unhone chennai ke khilaaf mumbai main khele gaye match main 18 ran dekar 5 wicket liye the
 He was able to take only two wickets in the remaining 5 matches

 s Sreesanth had a charismatic performance against Delhi, but in the 3 matches he played before, he took only 1 wicket

 The death of the aunt and aunt of the victim of the Unnao rape case is the fourth such death in her family in the last 18 years, which is being blamed on MLA Kuldeep Sengar
 isse pehle peedit ke taaoo phir peedit ke pita kii maut ke liye bhi vidhayak ko zimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha
 Even to implicate the victim's uncle in a case of attempted murder, the family accused the MLA as a culprit
 ham aapako bataate hai ki aakhir 18 saal pehle peedit ke parivaar or vidhayak ke bich ranjish kii kahani shuru kaise hui thi?is kahani kii shuruuaat unnav jile ke makhi gaanv se hoti he
 Sarai Thok Mohalla of Makhi village houses the house of accused MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and the victim girl
 donon gharon ke bich kareeb bees kadam kaa faasla he
 And this anecdote is about 18 years old
 peedita ke parivaar par maut kaa sayamakhi gaanv ke sarai thok mohalle main teen bhai rahaa karte the
 Guddu Singh, Mahesh Singh and Pappu Singh
 teenon bhai ilaake main dabang ke taur par jane jate the
 Many different cases were also filed on these
 guddu singh rape peedit ladki kaa taaoo tha
 About 15 years ago, Guddu Singh was beaten to death by people in the village itself
 mahesh singh peedita kaa chachaa he, jo is vakt raibareli jail main band he
 The victim was going to jail on Sunday to meet her
 jabaki pappu singh peedita ke pita the
 Who died in 2017 after beating the mla's brother and his operatives
 yani peedit ladki ke taaoo or pita donon maare ja chuke hai
 While the victim's uncle is serving a ten-year sentence in Rae Bareli prison in a case of attempted murder
 or isi chachaa kii patni or saali kii bhi ab usee sadak haadase main maut ho chuki he, jise lekar tamaam shaq or sawaal uth rahe hai
 Now the most important thing here is that barring the death of one Tau Guddu Singh, every finger and finger is going directly towards MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar for every death and uncle going to jail
 yahaan tak ki rape kaa ilzaam bhi usee ke sir he
 And now the suspicion of this road accident is going on
 par aisa kyon? kyon kareeb dedh dashak main ek puraa parivaar bikhar gaya? rape peedit ladki ke or vidhayak ke parivaar ke bich kya koi puraani dushmani he? agar haa to kis baat par?to kahani shuru hoti he 2002 main

 But after becoming MLA for the first time, Kuldeep Singh Sengar suddenly started avoiding the three brothers
 iske baad donon pariwaron ke bich daraar padani shuru ho gai
 Gradually, this rift turned into a mutual rivalry
 isi bich gram pradhan kaa chunaav aa gaya
 Then Tau Guddu Singh of the victim girl decided to contest the election of Pradhani himself to teach Sengar a lesson
 udhar, duusari taraf vidhayak senger kii maa chunni devi pradhani kaa chunaav lard rahi thim
 It was for the first time that the two families were face to face
 haalanki chunaav se ain pehle kuldeep singh senger ne guddu singh ke mukademon ko hathiyaar bana kar uski ummidavaari khaarij kara di
 Hence, instead of Guddu Singh, the mother of his close Devendra Singh was removed in the election
 isi pradhani ke chunavi prachaar ke dauraan peedit ladki chachaa mahesh singh or senger or uske baayiyon ke bich jhadap ho gai
 The bullet also fired
 jisamen kai log ghayal ho gaye
 Later on behalf of MLA Sengar, police registered a case of attempt to murder against Mahesh Singh
 isi bich in do parivaar ke bich kii aapasi dushmani main pehla katl peedita ke taaoo guddu singh kii hui thi
 In the village itself, some people attacked him with brick-stones and killed him
 uski hatya kii sajeesh rachane kaa ilzaam guddu ke ghar waalon ne tab vidhayak kuldeep senger par hi lagaaya tha
 Immediately after the death of Guddu Singh, the victim's uncle Mahesh disappeared leaving Unnao
 phir kareeb 17 saal baad 2018 main use dilli ke kareeb se pakadaa gaya or ab usee maamle main wo raibareli jail main das saal kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 On 4 June 2017, the 17-year-old victim accused MLA Sengar of robbing her at her home
 is ilzaam ke baad vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ke bhai atul singh or uske saathiyon ne peedit ladki ke pita pappu singh ko buree tarah peetane ke baad police ko saunp diya tha
 Then father Pappu Singh also said that he was being implicated in a fake case
 lekin police ne phir bhi arms act kaa mukadmaa darj kar pappu singh ko jail bhej diya
 Where he died two days later
 ye donon pariwaron ke bich ranjish main hui duusari maut thi
 And now two more died in the family of the victim
 ek chachee or duusari chachee kii bahan kii
 Chachi was also an important witness in this case against MLA Sengar
 jabaki khud peedit ladki kii haalat najuk bani hui he
 Obviously, the matter is not just for the rape
 balki ye ek puure parivaar ke ujadane or use ujaadne kaa maamla he
 At the root of this case is a person called MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar

 He was also severely criticized in the media for this

 bijepi ke jitne bhi mantri hon, mujffarpur prakaran par bhale hi unki sidhi jimmevary banati ho, lekin chuppi sadhakar wo nitish kumaar ko hi nishaanaa banane de rahe hai
 It seems that the BJP leaders are doing this as part of a well thought-out strategy inside the party

 Although it will vote against this bill or boycott the house at the time of voting, the party has not made its decision public
 lekin jab se pradhanmantri narendra modi ne duusari baar shapath liya he, bijepi or jediu ke bich rishte sahaj nahin dikh rahe hai
 Although Nitish Kumar is repeatedly clarifying that the relationship is completely normal, it is not going down the throat of anyone and many things related to stress are coming out

 Now from October 1, you will get the benefit of government facilities only after showing the receipt of electricity bill payment
 yahaan tak ki cotedaaron ko bhi order jari kar diya gaya he ki jo bijli kaa bill jamaa karne kii raseed dikhaae, use hi rashan diya jaae
 However, questions are also being raised on this order
 kaha ja rahaa he ki prashasan sarkari vibhaagon ke baari-bharkam bakaae ko vasuulne kii jagah sirf janata par hi chaabuk chalaane main juta he
 Before Jaunpur, the DM of Gorakhpur district has taken out such an order
 dm jonpur ne 18 sitambar ko jari aadesh main kaha he ki bijli upabhokta samay par bilon kaa bhugtan nahin karte hai
 Since power is procured from the Power Generation Corporation through a letter of credit from Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited
 iske chalate vibhaag ke paas cash kii samasya rahati he
 Lack of funds leads to emergency cuts in case of power purchase
 is naate nirnay liya gaya he ki ek oktober se rajya sarkaar kii ore se sanchalit jansuvidha kendron, tehsil, colectrate or vibhinn vibhaagon se aam jan ko di jane vaali sevaaon ke liye prarthana patr prastut karte samay aavedak ko vidyut bill bhugtan raseed bhi pesh karne hogi ki usne yaa parivaar ke sadsy ne bhugtan kar diya he
 It is said that such an order has also been issued by Gorakhpur district administration
 shashan str se bakaayaa bilon ko bhugtan par sakhti kiye jane ke baad jilon ke dm apane-apane str se koshishen kar rahe hai
 These facilities will not be available if the bill is not filled - caste, income, domicile, status certificate from the Revenue Department, copy of Khatauni - Birth and death certificate from Urban Development and Panchayati Raj Department, copy of family register - Use of sound amplifier from district administration Permission of - Home tax and water tax to be collected by the Nagar Palika Parishad - Rana from the District Supply Department - Other services like - Passport, PM Housing Scheme Defense, arms license, mining lease, excise license, vehicle registration gujarat main patidaaron ke liye obisi aarakshan kii maang karne vaale patidaar anamat andolan samiti (PAAS) ke netaa hardik patel ko shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne aagaamee gujarat vidhaan sabha chunaav ke liye party kaa cheharaa ghoshit kiya he
 It is being said that Shiv Sena's big move against BJP is because Hardik Patel describes BJP as enemy number one, then Shiv Sena's relationship with the party is not going well
 ek ore maharashtra main hone vaale biemasi chunaav or duusari ore disambar main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav, usase thik pehle shivasena ne patidaar netaa hardik patel se dosti kar lee he
 Yeh Dosti of Uddhav and Hardik can pose a challenge for the BJP in Maharashtra and Gujarat
 1
 Shiv Sena has taken a strong stand against the Maharashtra government with the announcement of not forming a BJP alliance in the BMC election
 mangalvaar ko hardik patel se mulaakaat ke baad sanyukt press conference main uddhav thakare ne maharashtra sarkaar ko notice par bataate hue kaha ki sarkaar shivasena ke samarthan se chal rahi he
 2
 patidaaron ke netaa hardik patelaarakshan kii maang ke saath hi bijepi kaa lagaataar virodh kar rahe hai
 Recently Hardik has returned to Gujarat, he was ordered by the Gujarat High Court to stay out of the state for 6 months
 3
 It was due to the Patidar movement that Anandiben Patel had to resign from the post of CM of Gujarat
 unke baad vijay rupani ne rajya kii kaman sanbhali
 Hardik Patel has made it clear that if the Patidars are not given reservation, they will fight and take their rights
 4
 In view of the attacks on Dalits in Gujarat last year, many Dalit leaders also supported Hardik Patel

 BJP has renominated sitting MP Kapil Patil on this seat
 jabaki congress ne purv saansad suresh taavade ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 There is a direct contest between Congress and BJP on this seat
 chunaav ayog ke aankadon ke mutabik is seat par kul 15 ummidavaar maidan main hai
 Bhiwandi Lok Sabha seat of Maharashtra came into existence in 2008 after delimitation
 iske baad yahaan pehla chunaav 2009 main hua
 If you look at the figures, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Kapil Patil of BJP won the election here
 unhen 4,11,070 vot hasil hue the
 He defeated Vishwanath Patil of Congress
 unhen 3,01,620 vot hasil hue the
 At the same time, Suresh Mahatre of MNS finished third
 unhen 93,647 vot mili the
 Let us tell that due to a triangular contest in Bhiwandi seat, no single party can win unilaterally
 pichley kuch chunaav se yahaan congress or bijepi kaa khel manase bigaadti rahi he
 a similar equation was confused in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 yahaan congress ke suresh taavare chunaav jite the
 He received 1,82,789 votes
 taavare ne bijepi ke jagannatha patil ko chunaav haraaya
 Patil received 1,41,425 votes
 vahiin, tisare sthaan par rahe devraj maharaatre unhen 1,07,090 vot mili the
 How to change Bhiwandi's equation
 
 
 
 Bhiwandi seat in Thane district was a part of Dahanu Lok Sabha constituency before delimitation
 dahanu se alag hone ke baad bhiwandi main wo teen vidhansabha ai jahaan bijepi kaa dabadabaa rahaa
 This is the reason why BJP has kept this seat with them after alliance with Shiv Sena
 maaloom ho ki 1999 main bijepi ke chintaman vanagaa ne dahanu loksabhaa seat par congress ke di em shingda ko haraaya
 Since then, bjp's dominance in Dahanu has increased
 lekin parisemen ke baad jin ilaakon main bijepi kaa dabadabaa tha unamem se teen vidhansabha seat jawahar, dahanu or igatpuri bhiwandi loksabhaa se cat gai
 The effect of which also appeared in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections in Bhiwandi
 yahaan bijepi kii haar hui congress ke suresh taavare jite
 While Jagannath Patil of BJP had to face defeat
 kya he vidhansabha siton kii sthiti
 
 
 The Congress and NCP have always dominated the 6 assembly seats of Bhiwandi Lok Sabha seat
 lekin pichley kuch chunaav se yahaan shivasena or bijepi ne dam bharaa he
 The equations have changed here in the last assembly election
 bhiwandi gramin or bhiwandi east vidhansabha par shivasena kaa raaj he
 So Bhiwandi West, Kalyan West and Murbad are ruled by BJP
 jabaki ensipi yahaan kii shahpur seat par kabiz he
 There is no limit for the workers when it comes to expressing their allegiance to their leader
 elahabaad ke kumbh kshetra main rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke prati nishtha jataane ke liye congress kaaryakartaaon ne kuch aisa hi kiya he
 Rahul is shown as Lord Shankar by placing hoardings in Kumbh and Rani Laxmi Bai as Sonia
 sonia gandhi ne kabhi satta ko zehar bataaya tha
 But, Congress workers want Rahul to take that poison in their throat like Lord Bhagwan Shankar to get the Congress to cross the electoral stale in 2014
 elahabaad ke kumbh kshetra main lage poster main bhagwaan shankar ke saath rahul gandhi kii tasviir lagaai gai he
 Like Shiva, the third eye is made on Rahul's forehead and like Mahadev's Neelkanth, the part of Rahul's throat is also shown blue
 saath main likhaa he-satta main jehar he thik haior jo peetaa he jaharvahi nilkanth hota haiutha lo halaahal or shankar ho ja
 
 
 This is not the extent of extortion
 kumbh kshetra main lage ek poster laga he
 On this poster, Sonia Gandhi is depicted as a ten Janpath queen on the lines of the Rani of Jhansi
 apane netaaon ke prati nishtha jataane kaa ye tarika nayaa nahin he
 But the introduction of such posters in religious events like Kumbh is new
 khaas baat ye he ki inhen lagane ke liye mela prashasan kii manjuuri bhi nahin lee gai

 amarsir singh assam main aatankwaadi hamale ke dauraan shahid ho gaye the
 After this, Indian Army officials brought his body to his native village
 is dauraan unke antim darshan ke liye sailaab umad padaa
 The officers of the Indian Army brought Amarsir's body with full respect and paid homage with state honor and paid his last respects
 shahid ke pita sukhminder singh ne kaha ki unke parivaar kaa ekmaatr sahaara ab unhen chhod kar chalaa gaya he or peeche parivaar main apni do betiyon ko chhod gaya he
 He demanded from the government that now the government should become the financial support of his family
 praapt jaankaree ke anusaar bhartiya sena ke jawan shahid amarsir singh kareeb 12 saal pehle vah bhartiya sena kii sikh sikhalit 13 batalian main bataur sipaahi bhartee hua tha or teen maah pehle hi ghar se vah chuttee kaat kar duty par gaya tha
 However, on this occasion, a young leader of the ruling party must attend and said that he will talk to the government for the financial help of the family

 priya ramani par aarope lagaate hue emje akbar ne kaha ki samaaj main unki chhavi ko kharaab karne kii niyat se aise gambhir aarope lagaae gaye hai
 He said in his court suit that allegations of sexual exploitation by Priya Ramani are baseless

 If the court feels that there is enough evidence in this case against Priya Ramani, then the court will send summons to Priya Ramani
 iske baad ramani par is cese main trial chalegaa or agar saboot nahin mili, to court apana faisla sunaate hue cese ko yaheen khatm kar degaa
 MJ Akbar, who was the Minister of State in the Modi government at the Center, is the first person to lose his chair facing sexual abuse charges
 lihaaja manahani kaa yah cese emje akbar ke liye behad mahatvapurn he
 So far 6 people have testified in court in favor of MJ Akbar in this case
 darjanabhar se upar mahila patrakaron ke yon utpeedan se jude aaropon ke baad emje akbar ko apni kursi tak ganvaani padi thi
 His personal experiences with Sunil Gujral and his personal experience with MJ Akbar in Veenu Sandal Court, including his co-worker Joita Basu and his co-worker in Patiala House Court, have been reported to the court
 in abhi gavaahon ne court ke saamne emje akbar kaa bachaav kiya he
 Not only this, MJ Akbarkhud appeared in the court and recorded his statement in this matter before the court
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main mahilaayein mitu abhiyaan ke tahat khulkar saamne ai thim or apane saath hue yon shoshan ke khulaase kiye the

 In the Manyawar Kanshiram Urban Residential Colony in Suhagin Purva area of balrampur Secure Assembly constituency, on January 22 afternoon, some people were showing a flag with a special election symbol and were appealing for votes on the same mark

 Administration officials, who reached the spot, caught three people buying votes from the note and got Rs 7,770 from them
 nakad, chunaav chihn or ek party ke teen jhande jabt kiye
 Police registered a case of violation of election code of conduct and started taking action against the accused

 a lawsuit was filed against a candidate for violation of the code of conduct
 ye donon vaakye aachaar samhita ulanghan ke maamle hai
 But how did these activities being done in a stealthy way got in the ears of the police and administration? Going to the bottom, in these elections, the role of the locally developed intelligence system of private spies and political parties on special missions comes to the fore
 darasal, paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main deevaaron main itane kaan ug aae hai ki zyaadaatar partiyaan or netaa apane or paraye kaa fark jaanane ke liye peshewar jasuson kii madad lene ko majaboor ho gaye hai
 The specialty of this intelligence is that the leaders are spying on the people around them more than the opponents

 Baldev Kumar Puri, the director of Delhi-based AMX Detectives, who is sending his spies in the election, says, "before the election campaign starts, the party high command took the help of the detective agency to sort out the right candidate from the panel of contenders
" '' puri kii maane to party hikeman ab jila str ke sanghathan ke hi bharose nahin he, balki peshewar jasuson ke jariye khud kaa apana soochna network bhi taiyaar kar rahaa he
 He was also mentioned by a leader of the Samajwadi Party (SP), a strong contender for power in Uttar Pradesh
 sapa ke is netaa ne kaha, ''ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa ke baad jis tarah se sapa ne apane kareeb 70 fisadi pratyaashiyon ke naam badale hai, uske peeche kahin na nahin nijee jasuson kii khufia report bhi jimmedaar he
 "actually, the SP had prepared the list of candidates on the basis of the report of the local in-charge
 kareeb ek saal pehle nijee jasuson ko in ummidavaaron kii jamini hakeekat jaanchane kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya
 The spies' report revealed that in some places strong candidates were rejected as outsiders, in many places candidates who did not fit the local equations got tickets
 isi aadhaar par ummidavaaron ko badla gaya
 Another SP leader says that only after the report of private detectives did SP re-constitute all its district officials and committees
 udhar, basapa ke 100 se zyada vidhayakon kaa tikat katane ke peeche bhi saal bhar pehle karaae gaye isi tarah ke khufia surveykshan kaa haath bataaya ja rahaa he
 Explaining the usefulness of the spies, Kunwar Vikram Singh, chairman of the Association of Private Detectives and Investigators (APDI), said, "before an assembly election, many party leaders fell behind their chief minister
 halaat se nipatane ke liye mukhyamantri ne nijee jasusi agency ko theka diya or party netaaon ko bataa diya ki jasoos un par najar rakhenge
 This news was also spread on TV through news

 After this development, the retardation was largely controlled

 He points out that the way the yatras have been in support of Mishra for the last few days, cases of violation of the code of conduct and misuse of money can also come up

 party sanghathan ko chhodkar nijee jasuson ko zyada tavajjo dene ke peeche netaaon ke apane tark hai
 a senior leader associated with the Election Campaign Committee in the BJP says that probing any information from party members is at risk of leaking, whereas it is not so with private detectives
 jasuson kii sevaayen lene vaala upabhokta bhi unhen nahin pahachaanata
 The coordinator of the detective agency is the link between the political party leader and the detectives
 maamla faqat jasusi tak hi simit ho aisi baat nahin he, balki jasusi agenciyaan pre-pole survey main sateek anumaan ke jariye apana hunar dikhaa chuki hai
 "my company has done a pre-poll survey for many big parties," says Armaan Khan, director of Federal Security Private Limited in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin ab puraa focus ummidavaaron kii jasusi tak simat gaya he
 According to Armaan, the candidate seeking the services of private detectives wants all the information of his opponent
 vah kis ilaake main chunaav prachaar karne ja rahaa he? uske saath kitne vaahanon kaa kafila he? ilaake ke koun-koun se pramukh log uske saath hai? chunavi sabha ho rahi he, to vahaan kya-kya baaten ho rahi hai? jasuson ke saamne sabase badi chunauti aachaar samhita ulanghan ke maamalon kii soochna samay rahete ekatra karne or claayent tak bhejne kii he
 In such cases, a slight delay gives the opponent a chance to escape

 How can a detective be recognized? Interestingly, the leaders spend crores on private detective agencies

 But everyone is silent on whether the expenses of the detective are included in the election expenses

 Malik was speaking on the occasion of the foundation stone ceremony of the Cancer Institute in Jammu
 unhone kaha ki ek din aayega jab pioke ke log niyantran rekha (elosi) paar karenge or pioke ke ekikaran kii maang karenge
 Malik said, 'in the eyes of the country, the governor is someone who plays golf and does nothing for the public
 magar pichley 1 saal main hamane jitna kaam kiya he, mujhe nahin lagata ki kisi chuni hui sarkaar ne bhi utana kaam kiya hoga

 Arguments in the deal process do not seem to be rejected
 The FIR should be filed: 3 petitions were filed for reconsideration

 sheersh adaalat ne is maamle par faisla padhate hue yachikakartaon ke dwaara saude kii prakriya main gadabadi kii daleelein khaarij kar deen
 His weak plea was found to be the biggest ground for dismissing the plea by the court
 punarvichaar yachikaaon par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne mana ki in yachikaaon main koi dam nahin he or court unki daleelon par sahamat nahin tha
 The Supreme Court said in its judgment that we do not feel that any FIR should be lodged in this case or any investigation should be done
 court ne aage kaha ki ham is baat ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate ki abhi is maamle main ek contract chal rahaa he
 Who had filed the petition? Also, the Supreme Court has admitted the mistake made by the Central Government in the affidavit

 On the reconsideration petition, a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice KM Joseph dismissed the judgment while dismissing it
 court pehle hi faisla de chukaa tha ki deal ko lekar kisi tarah kii aniyamitata nahin barti gai thi
 Now there is no need to investigate: SC Bench of the Supreme Court, giving the verdict, told the Guru that no investigation is needed in this case
 deal main modi sarkaar kii bhoomika nahin he
 Also, the court also said that there is no power in these petitions
 ham nahin samajhate ki exiaar yaa rafel deal ko lekar kisi tarah kii jaanch ke aadesh die jaaen
 On 14 December 2018, the apex court dismissed the petitions seeking an inquiry against the alleged irregularities in the agreement of about Rs 58,000 crore
 court kaa yah faisla modi sarkaar ke liye kaaphi raahat bharaa he kyonki congress ne is qaraar ko loksabhaa main chunavi mudda banaaya tha

 Team India's middle-order batsman Ajinkya Rahane knows that the Australian team is adept at sledging (sledging) to put pressure on the opposition players, but they are not at all concerned about the situation
 rahane ne kaha ki team india kii har australian khilaadi ke liye yojana taiyaar he or ham pune main guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahi chaar test maichon kii siries ke dauraan aakraamak cricket khilne kii koshish karenge
 Players from India and Australia have been involved in such incidents of sparring several times in the past
 is baar to captain steven smith ne bhi spasht kar diya he ki unki team bharatiyon ke khilaaf chhintakashi karne main hichakegi nahin
 However, vice-captain David Warner had indicated that he would not spearhead in-form Indian captain Virat Kohli
 tippaniyan Rahane told reporters here, 'we do not know if they will take a splatter or not
 hamane sabhi ke liye kuch ranneetiyaan banaayi hai, main unki yahaan charchaa nahin karuunga
 It is on the basis of skill or on the basis of spattering, but definitely a plan
 ham jaanate hai ki australian team ‘mind game’ khelti he
 Our aim will be to pressure them in every sense
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham spinneron ke khilaaf hi nahin balki sabhi gendbaajon ke khilaaf sakaaratmak or aakraamak cricket khelnaa chahenge
 Practice matches and Test matches are completely different, so we have to read the circumstances well and show the game according to the circumstances, this will be important
 ’ Rahane said that Team India would like to focus on their strength during the Test series rather than losing sleep over their rival combination
 unhone kaha, ‘australian team bharat terning pich kii ummid kar rahi he, lekin hamaare liye apni kshamta ke anuroop khelnaa mahatvapurn he
 It is important for each team member to follow their own strategy
 ’ vibhinn praroopon main khilne ke bare main sawaal poochne par rahane ne kaha, ‘aap jis bhi praaroop main khelte ho, aap apni team ke liye apana sarvshereshth dena chaahate ho, bhale hi yah tii20 ho, test ho yaa phir vanade
 But if you are playing in two or three formats, then it is just to mentally adjust
 yah takneekee se talmail ke bajaay maansik sanmjasy bithaana he
 ' rahane ne yahaan patrakaron se kaha, ‘ham nahin jaanate ki ve chhintakashi karenge yaa nahin
 We have made some strategies for everyone, i will not discuss them here
 yah kaushal ke aadhaar par he yaa chhintakashi ke aadhaar par, lekin nishchit rup se ek yojana he
 We know that the Australian team plays the 'mind Game'
 hamaara uddeshy un par har myne main dabaav bananaa hoga
 "we would like to play positive and aggressive cricket not only against the spinners but also against all bowlers
" abhyaas match or test match puri tarah se alag hote hai, isaliye hamen paristhitiyon ko acchhee tarah padhanaa hoga or halaat ke anuroop khel dikhaanaa hoga, yahi ahm hoga
 ' rahane ne kaha ki team india test siries ke dauraan apane pratidwandvi ke sangyojan ke bare main neend khone ke bajaay apni majbootee par dhyaan lagaana chahega
 He said, 'the Australian team is looking forward to the India turning pitch, but it is important for us to play to our potential
 prayek team sadsy ke liye apni ranneeti ke anusaar chalanaa ahm he
 Asked questions about playing in different formats, Rahane said, 'whatever format you play, you want to give your best for your team, whether it is T20, Test or ODI
 lekin agar aap do yaa teen praroopon main khel rahe ho to yah sirf maansik rup se sanmjasy bithaana he
 It is a combination of mental harmony rather than technical coordination
 ’ Rahane said that Team India would like to focus on their strength during the Test series rather than losing sleep over their rival combination
 unhone kaha, ‘australian team bharat terning pich kii ummid kar rahi he, lekin hamaare liye apni kshamta ke anuroop khelnaa mahatvapurn he

 ' dakshin asia ke aath deshon kii sarkaron ke pramukhon ke dakshin asian kshetreey sahyog sanghathan (saarc) kaa do din kaa shikhar sammelan kathmandu main sampann hone tak saaf jaahir ho gaya ki uskaa ant nikat he
 But instead of the dazzling pyre of SAARC, it seemed that a new faction was taking shape under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra
 modi ne apane udghaatan bhaashan or uske baad pakistan ko chhodkar afghanistan, bangladesh, srilanka, bhutan, maldive or nepal ke netaaon ke saath aapasi mulakaaton main bahut had tak saaf kar diya ki ve or bharat ab nae ubharate dakshin asia kaa netritv karne kii thaan chuke hai
 Prime Minister Modi read in a well-spoken English teleprompter in his speech, "relationships will be stronger, within or outside SAARC, between us or between some of us
" ”pichley kuch maheenon main america se japan, vietnam or myanmar hote hue australia tak ke modi ke safar kaa anubhav saaf jhalak rahaa tha
 For the second time in four months, Modi had made his mark as a global leader to a large extent by stepping into Nepal
 shaayad unhone faisla kar liya tha ki ab kshetreey vyapaar or sampark ke jariye dakshin asia ke aarthik uddhaar kaa sahi samay aa gaya he
 If the idea of consensus within the scope of the SAARC doctrine has a chance to move forward, then otherwise SAARC can be sacrificed to reshape South Asia
 isamen bharat, anya sabhi kshetreey rajdhaniyon ke saath aarthik gatividhi kaa samanaantar rasta kholegaa
 If a country does not agree, then you can leave
 jo desh saath denge, unke hit main bharat jimmedaari legaa ki un sabhi ko laabh ho
 Indian officials told how Modi spent more than half of the day in a mutual meeting with Nepal in the half day of 25 November
 modi ne use ek troma centre daan diya, nae urja vyapaar samjhaute kaa elaan kiya or sadakon tathaa anya buniyadi suvidhaon ke nirmaan ke liye ek arab dollar kaa karj bhi de diya
 In this way, he acted as if in a few hours, which never happened in many years
 nepal ke model ko ab baaki dakshin asia main bhi apanaaya jayega
 Indian officials said, "in this new South Asia, SAARC will be just a platform for connectivity
 yani ek raah saarc se niklegi to duusari uske baahar se
 This honesty of Modi touched the hearts of other leaders that India is responsible for not doing much in recent years
 ”bangladesh kii shaikh hasina, afghanistan ke ashraf gani, bhutan ke tshering tobge, srilanka ke mahindra rajpakshe, nepal ke susheel koirala or maldive ke abdulla yamin abdul gayyum ke saath modi kii mulakaaton se aisa laga ki kam se kam in netaaon ne to modi kaa saath dene kaa iraadaa bana liya he
 They all appreciated Modi's thinking
 unamem se anek kaa kahana tha ki dakshin asia ko lambey samay se aise joshilay netritv kii aavashyaktaa thi
 In Tobgay's words, Modi and India are "natural leaders"
 ” tarif ke aise shabd bharat ke satta pratishthan ke liye bahut sukhad hai kyonki uske kaan to itane varshon main ‘dadaageeri’ jaise aaropon or fatvon ko sunate-sunate pak chuke hai
 Prime Minister Modi told Sheikh Hasina that the Standing Committee of the Ministry of External Affairs in Parliament approved the ground border bill (after the signing between the two countries in September 2011, the bill for this purpose was strongly opposed by the BJP at that time in opposition)
 And he will work on it as soon as he returns from Nepal
 maldive ke raashtrapati ko modi ne machhlee pakadaaey main unnat takanic apnaane ke phaayde samajhaae
 He said that as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he advocated the use of satellites to identify areas that are flooded with fish (he said that "herds of fish live in one place 24 hours")
 gujarat ke machuaaron ne unke suzav ko bakhubi apanaaya
 Mahindra Rajapaksa, who recently announced midterm elections in his country, invited Modi to visit Sri Lanka
 modi ne maut kii sajaa paae tamilnadu ke machuaaron ko maaf karne ke liye unka aabhaar vyakt kiya
 But this time he did not preach to the Sri Lankan President to hand over land and police rights to the administrative unit of the Northern Province, as he had advised in May
 jahaan tak pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif kaa sawaal he, bharat ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki unhone modi se mulaakaat kaa samay nahin maanga tha
 However, Sharif told Pakistani media, "the ball is now in India's court" as India canceled the foreign secretaries' meeting in August
 haalanki pakistan ke videsh niti salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ne pakistani ucchayukta kii hurriyat netaaon se mulaakaat par baad main afsos jaahir kar diya tha, phir bhi bharat ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 Pakistan's media has called the SAARC summit a 'modi arc'
 ek pakistani media vishleshak ne sawaal uthaaya ki bharat ke pradhanmantri ne sahmati ke siddhant ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 The question of a Pakistani expert was that now if Pakistan did not allow Indian trucks carrying goods to pass through their country to increase commercial relations with Afghanistan under Modi's new mantra, then India will point fingers at it
 nepal ke jane-maane patrkaar kanakamani dikshit ne saarc main modi kii ranneeti ko ‘ekatarfa kshetravaad’ kaha
 He said that Nepal's proposal to increase the cooperative movement throughout the region and provide more protection to South Asian migrants was not given due consideration
 bangladesh ke ek visheshgy ne saarc upgrah ke modi ke prastaav ko ‘bahut swaagatyog’ to bataaya par kaha ki modi ne kuch maheene pehle sriharikota main is uphaar kii ghoshnaa karne se pehle kisi duusare desh se salaah nahin lee thi
 According to an Indian insider, there is a ghost to show some tax on Modi and he has taken a lesson from China and America to collect coins in the area on the strength of his work
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki sharif ne kathmandu main dohari bhul kii he
 He troubled host Nepal by publicly refusing to sign a regionwide agreement for road and rail connectivity
 or ab 30 november ko vipaksh ke netaa imran khan kii ek or mahadhar kii dhamkee ke bich swadesh lautate sharif pehle se adhik kamjor lag rahe hai, kyonki narendra modi naam ke us vyakti ne bhi unhen chhod diya he jiske liye ve pakistan kii sarvashaktimaan sena kii naaraazgi kaa jokhim uthaakar may main shapath samaaroh main dilli aae the
 Of course, Modi is not too worried about the fate of Sharif
 asal main unhone nepal saarc shikhar sammelan main dakshin asia ke nae bhavishya ko aakaar dete hue bahut had tak saaf kar diya ki ab is kshetra main unki soch chalegi

 stri-purush ke vivahetar sambandhon se judi dhara 497 ko lekar supreme court main lagaataar sunwaayee jari he
 The Supreme Court on Thursday commented on the matter, asking if a married woman befriends another married man, then why should only the man be held guilty in this case? The petition challenging Section 497 is being heard
 sunwaayee ke dauraan is dhara ke praavdhaan par court ne aashcharya jataate hue kaha agar avivaahit purush kisi vivaahit mahila ke saath sambandh banaata he to wo vyabhichaar nahin hota, lekin yahi kaam koi vivaahit purush kare to aparaadh
 While the woman is not responsible even as a participant in the crime
 court kii ore se kaha gaya ki agar purush ko doshi bataaya jaataa he, to isamen mahila kaa bhi utana hi dosha he
 During the hearing, the court expressed surprise that it is not a crime if a married man forms a relationship with the consent of the married woman's husband
 iskaa matlab kya mahila purush kii nijee milkiyat he ki wo uski marji se chale
 The court said that even though it is not right to make a woman guilty in this law, but in a way this law is also anti-women

 '' The infighting of the BJP is coming out with a new color every day

 In the BJP, Sanjay Joshi also had special charge of Uttar Pradesh, which he has now left
 sanjay joshi ne bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko apana istipha bheja, jisase manjuur kar liya gaya
 Sanjay Joshi told Aaj Tak that he has not left the primary membership of the party, he is still in the BJP
 haalanki unhone yah sweekaar kiya ki unhone narendra modi ke kaaran hi istipha diya he
 In a letter sent to Nitin Gadkari, Sanjay Joshi has written that he wants to be free from all the special responsibilities of the party
 gauratlab he ki sanjay joshi ko aresas or nitin gadakari kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 Sanjay Joshi recently resigned from the BJP executive because of a bitter relationship with Narendra Modi

 Sushil Modi said this in an interview to an English newspaper
 unhone haalanki spasht taur par narendra modi kaa naam nahin liya

 After Nitish Kumar's consistent support for demonetisation, the Congress has made it clear that the PM candidate of the Grand Alliance will be its leader Rahul Gandhi
 congress is baat se chidhi hui he ki nitish kumaar khud ko secular gathbandhan kaa netaa sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 According to the Times of India news, the Congress feels that Nitish has taken a different approach to demonetisation because he wants to maintain an independent image of himself keeping in mind the 2019 elections
 gauratlab he kijediuke mukhiya nitish ne notebandi par modi sarkaar kaa samarthan kar sabko chaunkaa diya tha or isse unke sahyogi dalon main chintaa to badi hi thi, congress bilkul gusse main aa gai, kyonki vah iske khilaaf pradarshan karne vaali sabase badi party he
 On Lalu Prasad's persuasion, the Congress agreed to consider Nitish a leader in Bihar, but now his attitude has wrinkled the foreheads of both the parties
 congressdvara desh main notebandi ke khilaaf rahul gandhi ke netritv main bade str par pradarshan kiya gaya or ab nitish ke is kadam se party ko lagata he ki use nuksaan hoga
 Congress leaders feel that Nitish has adopted this attitude keeping Lok Sabha elections in mind
 congress ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki bihar main to kaise bhi sameekaran ho sakate hai, lekin sansadeey chunaavon main rahul ke netritv ko koi chunauti nahin di ja sakati

 aakhirkaar tay ho gaya ki world tii20 shahid afridi ke liye bataur captain antim toornament hoga
 The PCB has announced his release from the post immediately after the World T20
 pakistan cricket board ke adhyaksh shehryaar khan ne isaki ghoshnaa karne ke saath hi yah bhi sanket diya ki cricketer ke rup main bhi is alrounder ke din ginati ke bache hai
 After returning from Kolkata on Monday, Shaharyar told reporters in Lahore that there was agreement between the board and Afridi that he would retire after returning from the World Cup
 shehryaar ne kaha, ‘is sahmati ke tahat vah world cap tak captain he or usne kaha ki vah iske baad sanyas le legaa
 If he also changes his mind and wants to play further, then it will have to be seen whether he is selected as a player or not
 ’ pisibi adhyaksh ne haalanki spasht kiya ki board ne pichley saal afridi ko tii20 team kaa captain niyukt karke galati nahin kii thi
 'afridi alone gives victory' Afridi is a great cricketer
 usne kai baar akele dam par jeet dilaai he
 If he fails in the last one or two times, then he starts focusing on it
 yah santulit drushtikon nahin he
 Afridi's place is very iconic throughout the country
 wo desh kaa ikon he
 The country should also support him fully
 ’‘june tak coach badla ja saktaa he’pisibi pramukh ne saath hi isaki pushti kii ki board is toornament ke baad coach ko badalane kii yojana bhi bana rahaa he
 Shaharyar said, 'we are watching it
 vakaar kaa anubandh june tak he
 i have spoken with Wasim Akram and some other senior players on this issue and he said that we should appoint a foreigner or a local coach, he can give the best results for the team
 nijee taur par mujhe videshi coach rakhane main kuch galat najar nahin aata kyonki ateet main hamane acha pradarshan kiya he
 And Bab Woolmer was our best coach
 ’‘imran ke aamantran main galat kya he’shehryaar ne in sujhaavon ko bhi khaarij kiya ki team main kisi tarah kii gutbaji he yaa koi khilaadi prerit nahin he
 Shaharyar Khan said, 'let me tell you that it is disappointing to lose once again in a World Cup match against India but there is no factionalism in the team and the players are motivated to be united and perform well
 ’pisibi pramukh ko saath hi kolkata main match se pehle purv captain imran khan ko team se baatcheet ke liye aamantrit karne main kuch galat najar nahin aata
 He said, 'I don't see anything wrong in this
 iskaa team prabandhan kii jimmedaariyon se kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 Imran is a big name and he came to tell the players just to be comfortable and not take pressure in the big match
 ’umr akmal ko lagaai fatkarshehryaar ne saath hi pushti kii ki team prabandhan ne imran ke saath team kii baithak ke dauraan ballebaaji kram main khud ko upar bhejne kii baat rakhane ke liye umr akmal ko fatkaar lagaai he
 Akmal made a special request to Imran Khan just before the match at Eden Gardens to ask Afridi to send him (akmal) first to bat
 yah baat media main aa gai or iske baad akmal ko pakistan cricket board ne fatkaar bhi lagaai
 Shaharyar Khan also made it clear during this time
 unhone kaha, ‘akmal ne pataa nahin kya kaha
 Management called him and said that these things are wrong
 ye team spirit ke khilaaf he
 What does he play higher than number four? ’bharat main hamaara shandaar swaagat kiya gayapisibi pramukh ne saath hi bharat or kolkata main pakistan team kii suraksha or mehmaannawaaji kii tarif bhi kii
 During this, Shaharyar Khan told reporters, 'I and Pakistan's team in India were treated very well
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki kolkata main cab adhyaksh saurav ganguli or bengal kii mukhyamantri ne hamaara bahut shandaar swaagat kiya
 He said, "we are fully satisfied with the security arrangements for the team
 bharat main pakistan ke khilaaf match ko lekar bahut utsaah tha or main aapke madhyam se yah kahana chaahunga ki hamaare bich dwipaksheeya siries shuru karne makul vakt aa gaya he
 "11th time we lost to India" When the PCB chief was asked if we lost to India for the 11th time, he said, "first we have won a lot from India
" 2012 main ham vahaan jaakar siries jeet kar lauten
 Many of our young cricketers are coming out well and the results will start coming after some time
 ’ bharat ko world cap main haraane par jor kyon nahin diya jaataa, is par shehryaar khan ne kaha, ‘ham is par bhi jor de rahe hai
 "pakistan will reach the semi-finals," Shaharyar Khan said, "we definitely lost to India but the team would reach the semi-finals after beating Australia and New Zealand in the next two matches
" hamaari team kii taiyaari bahut badhiya he or unamem jazbe kii koi kami nahin he
 Their preparation against India was also good but they could not perform as expected

 Every Indian was saddened after India's crushing defeat in the Champions Trophy
 log ro rahe the, or apana gussa jaahir kar rahe the
 People were also sad that we lost in the finals from Pakistan
 ab soshal media main ek video jabardast viral ho rahaa he, jisamen ek baccha bharat kii haar ke baad ro rahaa he
 And his mother is trying to silence him
 jab puri team fail hui, to ye do khilaadi shaan se khadey the!video main kya bol rahaa he aadi?darasal, is bachche kaa naam aadi he
 The one who is crying fiercely after Hardik Pandya's dismissal is sad as to why Ravindra Jadeja got him dismissed
 aadi video main bol rahaa he ki bharat ke ab 8 wicket gir gaye hai, ab india kaise jitegaa
 Adi's mother is trying to silence him
 video dekhne ke liye is photo par clic karen
 
 
 Younger brother said - Kohli will kill Jadeja
 
 When Adi was crying, his younger brother was also standing there
 tab uske bhai ne kaha ki tu, chup ho ja
 Right now, Hardik will go and tell Virat Kohli, then Kohli will slap Jadeja
 lekin phir bhi aadi apane aap ko rone se nahin roak paa rahaa he
 In the video, he is repeatedly saying that Jadeja has got Hardik Pandya out
 karaari haar ke baad team india ne shandaar khel bhaavana, ICC ne bhi kiya salamaise out hue the pandyadarasal match ke 27wein over main jadeja ne hasan ali kii gend par ek shot khelaa jis par pandya ran lenaa chaahate the, lekin jadeja ne ran lene se manaa kar diya jiske baad donon ek hi chor par ja pahunche or natijan pandya ko apana vikat khona padaa
 Jadeja got angry on social media for this run out
 lekin jadeja kii kheli gai ek gend par pandya ran out ho gaye, jisko lekar soshal media par logon ne rabindra jadeja par jamkar kar nishaanaa saadhaa he, kisi ne unki tulana bahubali ke kattapa se kii to kisi ne unke khilaaf fatwa nikaalane kii baat kahi
 Team India's defeat against PAK reminded them of the 2003 World Cup final
 
 
 
 
 
 With this team, is Virat Kohli winning the World Cup? dilli se aam aadmi party ke siem pad ke ummidavaar arvind kejariwal 'je' tip ke netaa nahin he
 He demolishes the glamorous form of Netagiri
 hamaare jaise kapade pahante hai or hamaari tarah bolte hai
 Here are such things presented on the basis of which i will vote for Arvind Kejriwal
 
 
 
 1
 samaj main aane vaali baat karte hai kejariwal'netaji' kaa intjaar karata ek aaleeshaan tambu or baahar bant rahi muft kachaudee khate do schuli bachche
 When the helicopter descends, a lot of dust gets blown into the children's rushes
 phir unamem se ek aankh minchate hue kahata he, 'samajhe pappu
 The leader would have been J, J
 ' main dilli meservind kejarivalko chununga kyonki vah 'je' tip kaa netaa nahin he
 He demolishes the glamorous form of Netagiri
 hamaare jaise kapade pahentaa he, hamaari tarah bolta he
 He does not speak the 'four P' and 'five S' type languages of PPT presentations of companies, but rather simple and understandable
 kyon galat to nahin kah rahaa ji?padhein
 
 
 i will vote for Ajay Maken, because
 
 
 2
 There was nothing wrong in Arvind's bookkeeping except a mistake like giving an apology, which was a strategic mistake and this mistake is also a 'strategic' mistake
 exam kii taiyaari main aapse bhi aisi galtiyaan ho jaati hai
 Yet Kejriwal apologizes with folded hands when he goes among the public
 is daur main jahaan satta ek nasha he, aapane aise kitne netaa dekhe hai?padhein-main kiran bedi ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 3
 haashiye ke sawaalon ko bahes main laekejariwal kii niyat par avishvaas paidaa ho, isaki koi pukhta vajah nahin he
 Delhi knows that whatever the person does, corruption will never, or will not allow
 aam aadmi ke naam par party banaai he to pehle usee kaa kaam karegaa, nahin to janata phir patake degi
 For years, some important questions have been brought to the center of Aam Aadmi Party politics
 paardarshita or raajnneetik naitikta inamen ahm hai
 'insane ka man se bhai bhachara', this is the anthem of our party 'our Party', which is going to be relaxed in the era of Ghar Wapsi, Love Jihad, Sadhvi, Sakshi and Yogi
 4
 The man gives the full account of the money, the common man raises money from party dinner, tea party or anywhere, the details of it are made public on his website
 lekin congress-bijepi ko chunaav ladane kaa paisa koun detaa he, hamen nahin maaloom
 If someone gives money from the backdoor, will the backdoor not get its job done? In India, the archaic principle of bribery says that it will get it done and it will get it done
 adani kii sampatti pichley kuch maheenon main kitni badi he, google karke dekhie
 The Aam Aadmi Party is in favor of bringing election funding under the purview of RTI
 agar bijepi-congress eemaandaar hai to vah iske khilaaf kyon hai? kuch to he jisaki pardadari he?5
 The stain is not on these, but on others
 
 
 rahi congress se samarthan kii baat, to yaad kiijie ki AAP ne congress se samarthan maanga nahin tha, congress ne samarthan kii chitthee alji ko pehle hi saunp di thi
 The Congress supported the AAP from outside without asking
 thik vaise hi, jaise ensipi ne bijepi ko maharashtra main kiya
 Before the election, the NCP, which Modi called the 'national Corrupt Party', later got a majority with the external support of the same and put a curtain of 'voice vote' to fool the public, oblivious to the constitutional nuances
 vahi bijepi ab jammu-kashmir main pidipi sang milakar sarkaar banane par vichaar kar rahi he
 6
 anubhav se jaruri he niyatakya kaha, kejariwal ko sarkaar chalaane kaa kam anubhav he? lekin hamaare system kii mul samasya 'anubhav kii kami' kabhi nahin rahi
 Did Congressmen have less experience of running the country? This is the time when we need a leader with clear intentions
 anubhav se samjhauta ham kar lenge
 Still, if you consider experience to be the key base, then with what mouth will Kiran Bedi vote? He has been in politics for four days and his litmus test is still pending
 aisa lagata nahin he ki vah bijepi ke paaramparik strecchar or taur-tareekon se hatakar kuch karengi
 7
 swasth samvaad bhi he ek vajahamein swasth samvaad or khuli bahes main yakeen karne vaala netaa chununga, pratidwandviyon ko block karne vaala nahin
 The man is ready to debate in front of everyone, but the 'party of the best speakers' is stealing his face
 bijepi ko kuch to dar he? nahin to phir aa jaae saamne, kar le america kii tarj par bahes

 49 dinon main bahut kuch diyaab kuch 49 dinon kii baat
 Arvind Kejriwal made 666 liters of water free and halved the electricity bills of electricity users up to 400 units
 isamen sabsidi kaa kharch aayaa 200 karod se kuch adhik or ek bahut bade tabake ko phayda hua
 Now look at the irony, the BJP, which inflated 714 crore rupees in the Lok Sabha elections and the Congress with 500 crores of excuses, is saying that subsidy is wrong
 bhai hansi aa rahi mere ko to
 Take away the subsidy of cylinder too
 9
 The agitation was good against Chorbaajari, subsidy on electricity was also temporary
 bijli companiyon ke nishpaksh audit ke baad iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan nikaala janaa tha
 That is why Kejriwal ordered the audit of power companies, which Congress could not do in 15 years
 kejariwal kaa andolan yah nahin tha ki bijli mahangi he
 The movement was that there is theft in electricity
 companiyaan munaafe kaa bada hissaa dabaa jaati hai or kaagajon par khud ko ghate main dikhaakar daam badhaane kaa dabaav banaati hai
 But in the 49-day government, Kejriwal told that he has come with the intention of clamping down on these companies
 dabaaya gaya munafa companiyon ke halak se nikaala jayega or uskaa phayda janata ko milegaa
 Kejriwal ordered FIR against Sheila Dixit and Mukesh Ambani
 is desh main ambani or shila jaise taqatvar logon par haath daalane ke liye kaleje kii jarurat hoti he
 Kaabil-e-mentions that the BJP made a lot of allegations against the 'son-in-law' in the election campaign, but after the election, the result was due to Dhaka
 10
 The struggle should be rewarded: BJP is an established party, AAP is still struggling
 bijepi ko vot dene ke to bahut maukey rahenge
 If the AAP does not like the rule, then after five years, the BJP or Congress will win the victory
 par simit sansadhano main kejariwal or unki team ne jo sangharsh kiya he, unhen uskaa inaam abhi milanaa chahie
 i do not say that the Aam Aadmi Party is my dream party
 lekin main is baat ko lekar sunishchit hum ki vah bijepi or congress se kahin behatar he
 If the same party rules the entire country, then there is a scope for autocratic power
 isliye bijepi ke vijay rath ko dilli main rokane kii jarurat he, taaki 'check and balance' bana rahe
 Kejriwal should also win to keep optimism alive for the movements in Gandhi's country
 agar vah nahin jeeta to hamaare sapanom kaa 'boj' uthaane ke liye koi sarphira bhi kabhi is desh main khadaa nahin hoga
 Then keep choosing, alternately, BJP and Congress

 Jaitley said that being a Kirajyasabhasadasya, Mallya tried to meet me once when i was leaving the house and going to my room
 jetali ne kaha, mere se milane ke liye ve teji se aage bade or kaha, 'main maamla nipataane ke liye ek ofer rakhana chaah rahaa hum
 In view of the false proposals of Mallya, i did not agree to anything and said that it is better to talk to banks on this issue than talking to me

 Rehan, the star striker of the Pakistani hockey team who had defeated the Indian soil in the World Cup and Commonwealth Games, said that the match in the World Cup cricket semi-final in Mohali on March 30 is not just to withstand the pressure but in this Mahendra Singh Dhoni The team can benefit
 rehaan ne kaha, ‘yah muqabla kaabiliyat kaa nahin balki dabaav kaa he
 In this, only the team will win which will withstand the pressure

 rehaan ne kaha, ‘hamane pichley saal bharat main do shikast jheli or uski vajah bhartiya darshak rahe
 Dhoni's team will also get the same support from the audience
 bharat ke liye yah sabase sakaaratmak baat hogi lekin is dabaav ko khilaadiyon ne haaavee hone diya to yah nakaaratmak bhi ho saktaa he
 He said that there is a lot of excitement about this match all over Pakistan and in the quarter finals against Australia, Pakistani cricket lovers were praying that India win
 rehaan ne kaha, ‘puraa pakistan chahta tha ki bharat jite taaki hamen semifinal main bharat se khilne kaa mauka mili
 The fun of playing in the World Cup against arch-rivals is something else and it is expected that Pakistan will do their best

 Another scam has come to light in the Barmer branch of this bank after the Mahaghotale of about Rs 11,500 crore was exposed in Punjab National Bank
 is baar is bank main pradhanmantri mudra yojana main farjivade kii baat saamne ai he
 CBI has also registered a case in this matter
 mudra yojana piem modi kii mahatvakankshi yojana he, jiskaa zikr vah aksar berogari ke sawaal par karte hai
 In this scheme loan is given at low interest rates and after granting the loan, the applicant has to acquire some property through this amount
 is shakha se jari kiye gaye mudra lone main aisa nahin hua
 According to the CBI, a senior branch manager at pnb's Barmer branch in Rajasthan distributed 26 Mudra loans 'between dishonesty and fraud' between September 2016 and March 2017
 kaha gaya he ki iske kaaran bank ko kareeb 62 lakh rupee kaa nuksaan hua
 According to the Business Standard, the CBI says that in the latest banking scam, PNB issued Mudra loans to applicants without verifying business or housing
 is yojana ke micro units deveopment and rifinance agency (mudra) yojana ke tahat farji lone jari kiye gaye
 The CBI has registered a case against the then branch manager of PNB Barmer city, Inder Chandra Chandawat
 sibiai ne kaha he ki unhone lone jari karne se pehle aavedakon kii jaanch nahin kii, physical veriphication nahin kiya or lone dene ke baad aavedakon ke sampatti arjeet karne kii bhi jaanch nahin kii
 The CBI said that only one of the 26 loans was investigated before issuing
 iske alaava, kisi bhi bank shakha ko 25 kimi aasapaas tak ke ilaake main rahane waalon ko lone jari karne kii ijaajat hoti he
 However, in the case of PNB, loans were also issued to people living in the 100 km area
 ab in 26 main sepanch lone enpie ho gaehain
 The bank cannot even recover Rs 62 lakh now, as the applicants did not even acquire any property
 sibiai ko pataa chalaa ki is maamle main jodhpur main tainaat pienbi ke dipti general manager ne jaanch bhi kii thi or is shakha ke manager ko suspend bhi kiya gaya tha, lekin baad main yah suspension waapas le liya gaya
 Now the accused of the scam is appointed in the PNB branch located in Abu Road, Rajasthan
 bataa den ki isse pehle, hira kaarobaariyonnirav modi or mehul chokasee ne pienbi ke sathajaron karod rupayon kii dhokhadhadi kii thi
 Now in the new scam, Chandawat has been accused of transferring the amount of Mudra loan of about two crore rupees to private accounts

 pustak of da screen ke lekhak brajesh rajput hai
 It is published from Manjul Publishing House
 prime time main channelon par hone vaali bahason se itar tivi kii asli patrakarita ko samajhane kaa behtareen madhyam he of da screen
 With the help of reporters and visuals on the spot, it is easy and interesting for the audience to understand any news
 lekin vahaan tak pahunchane ke liye patrkaar or cameraman kii jaddojahad amuman saamne nahin aati
 Actually, there are stories of the same struggle in these 75 stories of TV reporting
 haadase hon yaa samaaroh, shakhsiyat ho yaa sarkaar, prakritik aapadaa ho yaa saamaajik sarokaar ke mudde—tivi patrkaar kii ankhen camere kii aad se hameshaa vah dekhne kii koshish karti hai jo dikhaaya na ja rahaa ho
 Brajesh said, "TV is less common
 jo nahin hota vahi karnaa to televijan reporting kii chunauti he
 "confirmation of the news, competition to bring visuals, piece-by-camera to chance, and unusual sightings from the eyes of the camera — how a reporter struggles with these confusions of TV journalism, can be understood through this book
 khabar kii tah tak pahunchane ke liye kabhi cameraman chot khaataa he to kabhi patrkaar
 The public watches the news through the media and the story before and after the journalist becomes the news
 kitaab kii bhashaa saral he
 Visuals will automatically float in your mind if you read them like a story
 tivi patrakarita par likhi gai yah kitaab kai aise muddon par chot karti he jinase reporter aae din do-chaar hote rahe hai
 For example, there is a situation where there is news even when this is so and there is news even if it is not so
 hard news bahut zyada he to jaruri muddon se judi soft khabaron ko kaise jagah dilaaein, news main tivi kaa material he yaa nahin, yah kaise dhundhen, tiarapy kii daud main kaise bane rahen, in sabake chakkar main kai baar reporters aisi chizon ke peeche daudaahe lagata he jis par baad main khud hansi aati he
 The book has unabashedly included some stories where the coverage of news is more than a small part of a video or audio
 tivi patrakarita main kariyar banane kii ichha rakhane vaale yuva ise course kii kitaab samaj kar padhein
 No lecture and stories will be found in any lecture in the class
 kitaab main sanjoya gaya field kaa yah gyaan practical se kam sabit nahin hoga
 *** centre kii modi sarkaar ne new india kaa naaraa diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream is that the economy of the country in New India will be $ 5 trillion, or $ 5 trillion
 darasal ek samay bharat ko sone kii chidiya kaha jaataa tha
 But the British emptied the treasury of India
 uske baad 1991 se ek baar phir bharat main aarthik tarakkee kii shuruyaat hui, jab se udaarikaran or aarthik sudhaar kii niti lagu kii gai he
 Nirmala Sitaraman presented the vision for making India a $ 5 trillion economy by 2024-25, presenting the 2019-20 budget in the Lok Sabha
 sarkaar ne bataaya ki is vijan kaa mukhya aadhaar nivesh prerit vikaas or rojgaar srijan he
 In fact, the economy is the structure under which all economic activities are conducted
 utpaadan upbhog or nivesh arthvyavastha kii aadharbhatu gatividhiyaan hai
 Gross domestic product (GDP) is used by economists to measure the economy
 bajet main new india kii guunjasarkaar kaa kahana he ki new india ke liye gharelu or videsh nivesh ko badhaava dene par jor diya ja rahaa he
 This requires huge investment for infrastructure, digital economy and employment generation in small and medium companies
 agle dashak ke vijan kaa ullekh bajet main kiya gaya he, jisamen bhautik or saamaajik avasanrachana ke nirmaan, mek in india, emsamai, start-ap, raksha vinirmaan, automobile, bydaree, chikitsa upkaran par vishesh dhyaan diya jayega, isamen vikaas or rojgaar srijan par focus rahegaa
 Focusing on the $ 5 trillion economy, the Finance Minister said that in this financial year itself, the size of India's economy will be 3 trillion dollars
 is vakt 2
 7 trillion dollars
 55 saal main bharat kii arthvyavastha 1 trillian dollar kii ho pai thi
 In the last five years itself, the government has increased its size by 1 trillion
 bharat ne 5 saal main apni iconmi 1
 2 from 85 trillion dollars
 75 trillian dollar kar lee he
 But the per capita income has increased much less than expected
 prati vyakti aay chintaa kaa vishqntarrashtriya mudra kosh ke aankade ke anusaar 187 main 2018 main bharat prati vyakti aay ke maamle main duniya main 142wein number par tha
 In 2014, India was number 169 in the world in terms of per capita income
 2018 main prati vyakti aay ke maamle main ghana, nigeria, nikaragua, srilanka jaise desh bharat se aage the
 The big question is that when the size of the economy increases, does the income of the common man increase
 2014 main 1
 85 trillion economy 2 in 5 years
 7 trillian dollar ke str par pahunch gai he
 So India has the potential to reach the target of $ 5 trillion in the next few years
 aapako ye bataa den ki philhal bharat duniya kii chhathi sabase badi arthvyavastha he
 The United States, China, Japan, Germany and Britain are ahead of India
 GDP bhi nahin de rahaa he saath2017 main bharat france ko peeche karke chathe number par pahunchaa tha
 This year, India will leave Britain behind at number 5
 5 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha vaale club main abhi america, china or japan hi hai
 But going to this club is not so easy
 aarthik surveykshan main kaha gaya he ki bharat ko 2025 tak is lakshya tak pahuchanna he, jabaki abhi bharat kareeb 7 fisadi kii vikaas dar se aage bad rahaa rahaa he
 Last year, this further reduced to 6
 8 fisadi hi rah gai
 Before the budget, the Economic Survey has projected a growth rate of only 7 percent, and if a $ 5 trillion economy is to be built, then a growth rate of 8 percent per year is needed
 kaise hasil karenge 5 trillian dollar kaa lakshya?haalanki 8 fisadi kii vikaas dar bhi kam padegi, kyonki anumaan ke mutabik ausatan hamen saadhe 11 fisadi kii vikaas dar chahie
 Then we will be able to reach 5 trillion
 lekin vitt mantri ne bajet main bataaya ki kis tarah se 5 trillian dollar ke lakshya tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he, isamen bataaya gaya ki isi saal bharat 3 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha vaala desh ban jayega
 - There is a need to invest in forward infrastructure, digital India and small industries
 5 saal main infrastracchar ke liye 100 lakh karod rupee ke nivesh ke liye kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 The government will invest 80 thousand crore rupees in the next 5 years to upgrade the roads
 -banking sector kii dikkaton ko dur karne ke liye 70 hajaar karod rupee die jaaenge
 The social sector has benefited from major changes coming from government schemes
 ye kaha jaataa he ki paise se paisa banataa he
 Money creates jobs, prosperity comes
 5 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha kaa matlab yahi he ki ham america china or japan jaise deshon ke saath khadey hon, jo apni samruddhi ke liye super power ke taur par dekhe jate hai

 During the survey, the team members fill all the information in a form
 form main jo jaankaree bhari jaati he usamen trek kaa number, trek main kya maal he, maal kaa vazan kitna he, trek chaalak ne isisi kaa bhugtan kiya he yaa nahin, jaisi jaankaree jutai jaati he
 But the most important information is where the truck is coming from and the goods have to be delivered, the information of this survey will be sent to South MCD
 isse pataa lagane main aasaani hogi ki aise kitne trek hai jinka dilli main kaam hai or aise kitne trek dilli se hokar ja rahe hai jinka kaam dilli main naa hokar padosi rajyon main he
 Due to pollution, a major cause of pollution in Trucks Delhi is the entry of such trucks in Delhi whose work is in the neighboring states of Delhi but due to no other route, they are forced to go through Delhi

 Although the work of building western and eastern peripheral highways on the outskirts of Delhi is going on to prevent such trucks from entering Delhi, but the people of Delhi are suffering due to its slow pace

 Modi's call: Work closely with the Center: On Sunday, Prime Minister Modi asked the Chief Ministers of all the states to develop a model of 'cooperative federalism' so that the Center and the State Governments can create a common program of development and prosperity by eradicating differences
 
 modi ne kaha ki bharat tab tak vikaas nahin kar saktaa, jab tak ki uske saath uske rajya vikaas na karen
 Modi said, he wants various state cooperatives to compete with each other under the spirit of competitive federalism to promote the government's action plan
 unhone kaha ki niti ayog kii sanchaalan parishad aise rashtriya lakshya ko hasil karne main madad karegi, jise sabhi rajya milakar tay karenge
 input-ians narendra modi kii lahar se bijepi uttar pradesh or bihar main karishmai aankadon ko chune main kaamyaab hui, lekin isse bhi badi baat ye rahi ki is lahar ne donon pradeshon main jatvaad ke ghinaune swaroop ko jabardast chot pahunchaai he
 No one had thought that the people of these two states divided in the name of Jat and Jamaat would do so
 bijepi ko mili siton ke aankade is baat ke gavaah hai ki in donon pradeshon main lagbhag chaar dashakon ke baad jati kii raajnneeti ko jabardast chot pahunchi he
 In the 1977 election, we saw that caste politics had evaporated from these states
 lekin uske baad phir waisi hi sthiti ho gai
 Now this time the people in both the states have strongly attacked casteist forces and helped in forming Narendra Modi's government
 bihar main ek ore jahaan lalu yadav ko apane emwai sameekaran par bharosa tha vahiin nitish kumaar ko bhi jatigat sameekaran se ummiden thim
 But the way the results came out surprised everyone
 bijepi ko na keval tamaam agadi jatiyon kaa mat mila balki pichhadi jatiyon main se badi taadaad main votaron ne uskaa saath nibhaayaa
 The only reason for this is understandable that the new young voters are thinking above the caste
 ve rojgaar or aarthik vikaas kii baat soch rahe hai
 Everyone is aware of the disharmony between castes in Bihar and politicians use it fiercely for their own benefit, but this time it did not happen
 yah baat uttar pradesh par bhi lagu hoti he jahaan jatigat raajnneeti kaa aadhaar darak gaya he
 Like Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav too had expectations on his MY equation
 lekin unhen bhi karaara jhatka laga he
 But surprised the Dalits who also voted for BJP in a big way, the result of which the BSP is suffering
 mayawati kii is party kaa loksabhaa chunaav main to supada hi saaf ho gaya
 It is clear that Dalit youth and women preferred development over caste
 unhen bhi laga ki modi ko ek baar mauka dene main koi aitraaj nahin hona chahie
 These election results from these states, immersed in the narrow politics of caste, are like the winds of the spring, which seem to give a direction to the country
 ab dekhnaa he ki modi or unki sarkaar jati kii zanjeer todane waalon kii ummiido par kitne khare utarate hai kyonki agar aisa nahin hua to jatvaad kaa yah ajgar hamen phir jakad legaa

 haalanki unhone kaha ki electronic upkarnon ke prati uske lagaav se uskaa bhavishya tay hoga
 Father Games said, 'I can see Bill Gates of the future here
 ’ Indian cricketers feel that their salary is less than the amount of money players are getting in the world
 isliye vishwa ke sabase amir cricket board se unhone paise badhaane kii maang kii he
 509 to BCCI in the year 2016-17
 13 karod rupee kaa munafa hua he
 He has been shocked by this demand of players
 haalanki supreme court kii taraf se banaai gai sioe ne is maang ko thukraayaa nahin he
 Let me tell you that earlier Ravi Shastri had said that the salary of cricketers in India has been doubled
 bisisiai ko australian cricket se kuch siikhnaa chahie
 The decision will be taken by the end of IPL 10, according to the COA, BCCI officials know this
 sioe ne bisisiai ke vartmaan padaadhikariyon ko 5 april ke din hyderabad bulaayaa he
 The COA has asked cricketers to stay until the end of IPL 10
 sioe chif vinod raay kaa kahana he ki is mudde par tippanee karnaa jaldbaaji hogi
 The agenda for the April 5 meeting has been set
 aakhir khilaadiyon ne maang kya kii he?bisisiai ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki australia ke khilaaf siries jeetne ke baad viraat kohli kii taraf se maang ai thi jisamen khilaadiyon kii selary badhaane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 According to sources, the Indian captain had said that Indian cricketers get less money than players of other countries
 balle ke baad mike se bhi hit hue sachin, kuch yun chhedi 'cricket vaali beet'kohli ko pataa chalaa ki bhartiya cricketrs paise ke maamle main england, australia or dakshin africa ke baad chauthe number par hai
 He then talked to senior members of the team
 phir sioe se meeting kii ichha jataai
 The COA did not initially succumb to this demand
 vajah ye thi ki nae contract main paise dogune kar die gaye the
 The a grade cricketer gets Rs 2 crore, with Virat Kohli and former captain MS Dhoni
 grad bi main rettenship ke ek karod or grad si main 50 lakh rupee milte hai
 After this Kohli insisted that he and his fellow players were not happy with the contract
 unhen utane paise nahin mil rahe, jitne ve chaahate the
 They now want five crores for grade A, three crores for grade b and one and a half crores for grade C
 kohli kaa tark he ki steve smith, david warner or jo root jaise cricketron ko unke cricket board zyada paise dete hai
 With the money that their boards give, Indian cricketers slip to fourth place in terms of money
 ab ek din ke CEO bane dhoni, sambhala Gulf Oil kaa jimmacoch kumble bhi hai kohli ke sathkohli ko coach anil kumble kaa saath mila he
 According to Kohli, England, Australia and South African cricketers earn 10 - 12 crores
 inamen rettenship or match fees shaamil he
 India's top cricketers earn between four and five crores
 isamen bhi rettenship or match fees shaamil hai
 The Indian captain has said that this is not acceptable
 khaastaur par aise samay, jab bisisiai kii kamai bahut zyada he or ve isisi se bhi kamai ke bade hisse kii maang kar rahe hai
 2 different contracts to be made for Test and limited overs cricket According to a BCCI official, 'kohli, his team and Kumble also want bonuses
 ’ adhikari kaa kahana he ki in logon ne sioe se kaha he ki do contract banaae jaaen
 One for Test and one for limited overs cricket
 donon formet main grad e cricketer ko paanch karod rupye die jaaen
 According to a BCCI official, this demand is interesting and has been made completely by planning
 kohli ne tamaam logon ke hit kaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 There is no resentment in the team with his demand
 na hi unhone kisi ko khush karne kii koshish kii he
 Grade a cricketers can get Rs 10 crore in both odis and Tests, for example Dhoni now only plays odis
 wo test nahin khelte
 They will also be entitled to five crore rupees
 isi tarah cheteshwar pujaara sirf test khelte hai
 They will also feel honored and happy
 kohli, rahane, aswin jaise khilaadi agar donon formet main form or team main jagah banaae rakhte hai, to das karod rupye kama sakate hai
 Similarly, if someone is in grade a and ODI grade B, then he will get Rs 7-9 crores
 players association bana sakate hai kohlibisisiai adhikari ke mutabik kohli players association banane kii bhi soch rahe hai
 Interestingly, the Supreme Court once asked Kumble to form a players association
 ye australia or west indies kii tarj par hone kii baat thi
 These players' associations interact with their cricket board before they become contracts
 adhikari ke mutabik kumble haalanki cricketron kii soch sioe ko bataa rahe hai, lekin sambhav he ki bhavishya main kuch khilaadiyon kii ek cameti ban jaae
 It may contain Kumble, Ashwin and Kohli

 unhone kaha, anuraag thakur rajaneta hai or sattarudh dal ke saansad bhi hai

 unhone kaha, ab bharat isisi toornamenton ke group charan main hamaare saath nahin khilne kii baat kah rahaa he
 The truth is that ICC earns a lot from india-pakistan matches and India gets a big part of it under the Big Three operating formula

 Money said that Pakistani cricket officials have been following the policy of keeping India happy for years as they want to restore bilateral cricket

 isisi ko unase poochna chahie ki pakistan yaa anya cricket masalon par bayaan unhone kis haisiyat se die hai
 The ICC constitution clearly states that no officer or member of the country will make such a statement that would hurt the reputation of the game and Thakur's statements have done so

 The first story is Karan Johar, which is based on homosexuality
 duusari kahani he dibaakar banerjee kii, jo ek rangamanch ke kalakaar kii kahani he, jise kaam kii talash he
 The third film is Zoya Akhtar, in which the story is of a child who loves to dance like a girl and wants to grow up to be a dancer like Katrina Kaif
 or chauthi kahani he anuraag kashyap kii, jisamen amitabh bachchan ke fain ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 The comments film kii chaaron kahaniyaan ek-duusare se alag hai, jise dekhakar lagata he ki yah multiplex audience ke liye banaai gai hai
 All four stories are experimental, far from the common man's understanding
 sabhi nirdeshkon ne jamkar experiment kiye hai
 It may be that different people like different stories from these
 film main kuch jagahon par hansi aa sakati he, magar film main antertenment vailu kii behad kami he
 Ever since 'bombay Talkies' was being produced, it has been promoted as a 100-year-old Bollywood tribute, but the actual tribute is in only one song, which comes after the film ends
 yah gaanaa bollywood par aadhaarit he or is gane main kai sitaron ne apni jhalak dikhaai he
 Perhaps the real effort of the filmmakers is to tell that by the time 100 years of Bollywood is over, we have changed so much and become so experimental that our experiment is far beyond the comprehension of the general audience, hence my rating for 'bombay Talkies' is 2 
 5 star
