 It is not known in which book
 lekin ladkaa ho yaa ladki unase yahi ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa rang-rup vaisaa hi hona chahie jo fishan industry ne tay kiya
 If he falls within the rules of the fashion industry, he can enter the modeling world otherwise
 lekin kya kabhi aapane sochaa he ki aakhir kyon aaj bhi mote or plus sies ke logon ko model kii najaron se nahin dekha jaataa? kyon vah is field main kariyar banane main asahaj mahasoos karte hai, aakhir isaki kya vajah he?is bare main india today minderox-2019 ke manch par ai model vaarshita Thatavarthi ne bataaya ki kaise un ladakiyon ko category main baant diya jaataa he jo mote yaa plus sies ke hote hai
 Let me tell you, Moderate Saurabh Dwivedi was doing this session
 varshita ne bataaya ki market main plus sies model yani mote logon ke liye modelling main kam maukey hai or jo maukey milte hai unhen anya model se alag samajha jaataa he
 What is UK2, UK4, US0 Moderating the show, Saurabh Dwivedi asks Varshita whether fashion designers design clothes for malnutrition patients if the figure sizes of the models UK2, UK4, US0 are fixed
 kyonki bharat ke log khate- pite, hatte-katte, swasth, tandoorast hote hai, to ye badlaav ki shuruyaat kaise hui?varshita ne bataaya ki model ke liye figure sies tay kiye gaye jate hai
 She shared an incident and told that 'lakme Fashion Week' is a special show of plus size model in which she walks

 Let us tell you, UK2, UK4, US0 are the size of the model based on which the models are selected
 meraa sawaal he ki plus sies ko special kyon mana jaataa he
 Why are ramp ramps organized for them? Why not make all these models a part of the main stream, fashion stream? While he said that the average figure size of most Indian women is 16
 vahiin agar aap UK2, UK4,US0 sies ke sample market main bech rahe hai to aap kis mahila ko kharidne ke liye target kar rahe hai?vahiin model narmata treepathi kaa kahana he ki 9 jiro sies kii ladakiyon ke saath ek plus sies kii model lekar khud ko mahaan darshane kii koshish na karen
 He said that 90 percent of the time, dusky tone skin and plus size models do not even get the opportunity to work

 'is thand main nahin chin sakate chat'aam aadmi party ke is kadam par vivaad ho gaya he kyonki jhuggiyon ko hoicourt ke aadesh ke tahat dhahaaya ja rahaa tha
 But the Aam Aadmi Party says that this order is four months old and until Delhi gets a stable government, it is not right to snatch their roof from the poor in this tremendous cold weather and did not force them to sleep in the open
 Can go aalochana bhi, tarif bhiaam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta bulldozer ke aage let gaye or geet aadi gane lage
 This move of the Aam Aadmi Party has started both criticism and praise

 aap vidhayak manish sitaudiya ne aarope lagaaya ki congress haar se tilamila gai he
 He said, 'if they don't get votes, then they are breaking the slums
 jhuggi ke logon ne aam aadmi party ko vot kiya tha
 Therefore, the roof is being snatched from them
 ham ye nahin hone denge
 Manish Sisodia, who is also considered to be the right-hand man of Arvind Kejriwal, doing politics, said Congress, 'these people have been living here for 35 years
 unke paas voter idi vagairah sab kuch he
 If the High Court gave this order months ago, why is action still being taken? ' bataaya jaataa he ki manish sitaudiya ne karrwai karne aae adhikariyon se hai court ke aadesh kii prati dikhaane ko kaha, lekin vah nahin dikhaa sake
 Congress leader Anil Kumar, former MLA from Patparganj, also here, asserting the responsibility of forming a government on the AAP, said, "these people should form the government
" vidhansabha main jhuggiyon ke bare main kuch karnaa chahie
 But they still want to perform
 sadak par bhajan gane se kaam thode na chalegaa
 'AAP workers were against demolition
 lekin congress kaaryakartaaon yahaan bhi raajnneeti karne se baj nahin aae
 His activists started shouting slogans like 'false promises will not run', targeting the AAP

 His amazing popularity on Facebook

 That too when crores of people have followed the Facebook page of all the stars including the Prime Minister
 rajasthan vidhansabha main aaj rajyapal kalyaan singh ke abhibhaashan ke dauraan achaanak raashtragan baj jane se rajyapal samet anya sabhi hatprabh rah gayi
 This incident happened when Governor Kalyan Singh was giving the address, the Governor stopped for a few seconds, suddenly the National Anthem started for a few seconds
 lekin kuch second main yah galati sudhari gayi or raashtragan band hone ke baad rajyapal ne phir apana abhibhaashan padhnaa aarambh kiya
 In the midst of the Governor's address, the sudden national anthem was played, the Speaker Kailash Meghwal, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the entire House were shocked
 naukarshahi main bada pherbadal karte hue sarkaar ne maujuuda vitt sachiv subhash chandra garg (subhash Chandra Garg) kaa tabadalaa urja mantralay main kar diya he
 At the same time, the current Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Atanu Chakraborty, will be the new Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs

 BJP netaaon kii gundgardee: toll tex maangane par karmchaaree ko jamkar peeta, CCTV main kaid puraa manzaris pherbadal ko garg ke liye nirvaasan ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he kyonki vitt sachiv kaa pad naukarshahi main behad pratishthit mana jaataa he or aamtaur par yah pad mantralay main sabase varisht adhikari ko diya jaataa he
 However this is not a surprising move as the NDA (national Democratic Alliance) government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not made such a reshuffle for the first time
 pehali baar 2014 main modi ke satta main aane par sarkaar ne tatkaaleen vitt sachiv arvind mayaram kaa tabadalaa paryaton vibhaag main kar diya tha
 After Garg's transfer from the Finance Ministry, the government can now choose one of the current Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey and Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar for the post of Finance Secretary

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne punjab neshnal bank-neerav modi scam ke mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa bolaa he
 Speaking exclusively to India Today, Rahul said that PM does not have time to speak on the Nirav Modi case as he himself is 'corruption'
 rahul bole ki hamane neerav modi, rotomac cese dekha he abhi or bhi maamle saamne aaenge
 Congress President said that BJP is spending thousands of crores of rupees in elections, after all where is this money coming from
 ye sab paisa neerav modi, vijay maalya jaise logon ke paas se hi aa rahaa he
 Therefore, there is no question why PM Modi is silent on this issue
 unhone kaha ki piem ke paas kareeb 2 ghante bacchon ko ye samajhane ke liye hai ki pariksha main kis tarah paas ho, lekin is mudde par ek bhi minute bolne kaa time nahin he
 Rahul said that he first took note ban, then asked the whole country to stand in the line of banks and black money was white from behind the bank
 twitor ke jariye bhi piem par waraiske alaava rahul ne twit ke jariye bhi piem par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He shared the tweet of suggestions for PM Modi's Mann Ki Baat and wrote that Modi ji, you ignored my suggestions on the Mann Ki Baat issue last month
 agar aap ignor karte hai to idia kyon maangate hai
 People of the country are asking questions on two issues

 com / jp0anleptu — Office of RG (@officeofrg) February 21, 2018 Explain that even before this, Rahul had surrounded the PM on this issue
 unhone likhaa tha ki piem bacchon ko 2 ghante tak bataate hai ki pariksha main kaise paas ho, lekin 22 hajaar karod rupye ke ghotaale par do minute tak nahin bolte hai
 Rahul had said that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been hiding since the scam
 unhone likhaa ki agar aap doshi hai to is prakaar kaa bartaav karnaa band karen or bolen
 The ED and CBI proceedings continued in the Nirav Modi case on Wednesday
 idi kii team ne buudhvaar ko 17 jagahon par chaape maari kii
 Four of these 17 places are in Mumbai, where the address of fake companies of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi has been given
 abhi tak neerav modi or mehul chokasee kii 126 farji companiyon kaa pataa chalaa he
 Of these, 78 companies are from Nirav Modi and 48 companies are from Choksi
 sutron ke mutabik in companiyon kii sankhya bad bhi sakati he
 The new alliances are being considered as a big political change in the by-elections in 10 assembly seats in Bihar
 is chunaav main na keval pehali baar vampanthi dal nayaa morcha banaakar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko rokane kii baat kar rahe hai, balki rajya main sattadhari janata dal (united) apane dhur virdohi rashtriya janata dal (argedy) or saath hi congress ke saath mahagathbandhan kar chunavi samar main kham thonkane kaa elaan kar chukaa he
 This election is not only being considered as a semi-final before the next year's Bihar Assembly elections, but it is also a litmus test for both the alliances
 vaise donon gathbandhanon ke liye bijepi se loha lenaa aasaan nahin he
 The biggest problem for the alliance is to keep the votes of each other's parties united
 is chunaav main congress ne jahaan pehali baar bihar main satarudh jediu se haath milaayaa he, vahiin lalu prasad kii argedy bhi is baar jediu ke saath gathbandhan main shaamil he
 Two decades ago, when Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar were together, both of them faced the Congress
 baad main lalu sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) kaa hissaa ban gaye, vahiin nitish rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) main shaamil ho gaye the
 Although the picture regarding the seats is not clear yet, so much has been decided that RJD and JDU will contest four seats while Congress will contest two seats
 lalu or nitish kah chuke hai ki mudda siton kaa bantwaaraa nahin, balki bijepi ko rokna he
 However, in the last Lok Sabha election, RJD got more votes than JDU
 us samay matadaataaon kaa kahana tha ki nitish ko vidhansabha chunaav main vot denge, abhi narendra modi ko kendra main laana he
 Now the Yaksha question is that Nitish will be able to retain the same charm by aligning with Lalu
 agadi jatiyon main kaam ke aadhaar par nitish kaa aakarshan rahaa he, parantu nae gathbandhan main agadi jatiyon kaa kitna samarthan nitish hasil kar paaenge, yah bhi ek bada prashn he
 Now the people of Bihar will put Modi in pajama? By the way, BJP is calling this alliance as 'jungle Raj Part Two'
 vampanthi dalon ne bhi argedy, congress or jedyn ke gathbandhan ko avasarwaadi gathbandhan kehete hue ekasaath chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 For the first time in Bihar, the Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Communist Party of India (CPM) and Communist Party of india-marxist-leninist (cpm-male) are contesting the elections together
 sipiem teen siton par, sipiai do or sipiem (maale) paanch siton par apane ummidavaar utaaregi
 Political analyst Surendra Kishore says that this election will mainly be a litmus test of the alliance between Lalu and Nitish
 vaise ab tak kii parampara rahi he ki matadaata jise kurta (kendra main sarkaar banaati he) pahanaati he use pyjama (bihar main sarkaar) jarur pahanaati he
 He says that when the Janata Party government was formed under the leadership of Morarji Desai at the Center in 1977, Karpoori Thakur's government was formed in the Bihar assembly elections that followed
 isi tarah 1980 main jab congress kii sarkaar kendra main bani, tab bihar main bhi congress kii sarkaar bani thi
 However, Kishore also believes that the real test of these alliances will be during the elections
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main jediu ko lalu virdohi matadaataaon kaa bhi vot bhi mila tha, aise main is gathbandhan main aane ke baad vah in voton ko apni ore aakarshith kar paaenge, yah dekhnaa hoga
 Manmohan government's cabinet will be expanded soon
 khabaren hai ki 28 oktober ko manmohan ke mantrimandal main kai nae mantri shapath le sakate hai
 Cabinet reshuffle on October 28? There are reports that the UPA government's cabinet may be reshuffled on October 28
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjeeke kaaryakramon ko dekhte hue sirf ravivaar yaani 28 oktober kaa hi din khaali najar aa rahaa he jab kebinet main pherbadal ko amalijama pahanaaya ja saktaa he
 According to reports, the cabinet reshuffle will reduce the burden of ministers holding more than one department
 is lihaaj se 2 se 3 nae kebinet mantri or 3 se 4 nae rajyamantri shapath le sakate hai or unhen khaali kiye gaye vibhaag saunpen ja sakate hai
 There will be no reshuffling of the best four ministries of the government
 mantri kii res main koun koun?siyaasi galiyaaren main is vakt sabase badi atakalein is baat kii hi he ki aakhir cabinet pherbadal main wo koun honge jinhen mantri kii kursi haath lagegi? sambhaavna he ki vilasarav deshmukh kii jagah bharne ke liye maharashtra se 7 baar se saansad vilaas muttemwar ko cabinet main jagah mil sakati he
 The name of Maharashtra's grassroots leader Gurudas Kamat is also in the news
 rajya mantri ke liye tarik anwar kaa naam pakkaa samajha ja rahaa he
 Deepa Dasmunsi, Pradeep Bhattacharya and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury are likely to join the cabinet from Bengal
 congress main apni party prajarajyam kaa vilay karne vaale chiranjeevi kaa bhi naam mantri kii res main he
 How much attention Rahul Gandhi's young brigade gets in this reshuffle of the Manmohan cabinet, it will be watched as well as the country would like to see how the UPA government treats its ministers surrounded by allegations? aisa lagata he ki congress netaa manishankar ayyar apni party ko nuksaan pahunchane ke morche par hai
 On Thursday, he called PM Modi a 'lowly person'
 iske baad piem modi ne gujarat main ek jansabha main iskaa jawaab dete hue kaha, 'aapane hamen neech kaha, nichali jati kaa kaha
 The results on the 18th will only show how heavy it would be for a Gujarati son to say so
 'is tarah congress netaa manishankar ayyar ne ek baar phir vivaadaaspad bayaan dekar congress ko mushkil main daal diya he
 They have done this many times before
 loksabhaa chunaav main unhone piem modi ko chywala bataaya tha, jiskaa congress ko kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 The PM told the public, 'you have seen me as the Prime Minister
 aapane kabhi aisa dekha he ki maine kabhi koi neech kaam kiya he
 Congress people have lost your mental balance
 mujhe koi farq nahin padataa is desh ke garibon ke saath baithne main
 i am proud that even though i belong to a low caste, it is my values to do high work
 'manishankar ayyar ke bayaan par bijepi bhi hamalavar ho gai he
 In a press conference, party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said that what the court says is the courtier
 yah unka saamanti ahankaar he ki gandhi parivaar hi shashan chalaa saktaa he
 Calling for revenge by voting, PM Modi said in Gujarat, 'I request all the people who have used such words for me, used for the Prime Minister of the country, i would only say that someone against them Do not say the word
 lekin agar aap ke dil main aisi maansikta ke liye gussa ho to 9 or 14 tarikh ko matdaan karnaa, camel ke nishaan par batan dabaakar ucch kaam karnaa
 i may be called a low caste, even if i say abusive words, but no one will say anything to others
 lokshahi main aise logon ko sabaq sikhaane kaa ek hi rasta he camel kaa nishaan dabaane kaa
 i was called a merchant of death, tried to put me in jail
 sarkaar is bayaan ko bhi aanshik tareeke se pesh kar rahi he
 He said that the Law Minister had faith in the statement of a foreign national but he did not believe the statement of Indian citizen Avinash Rai
 surajevaala ne spasht kiya ki congress party ne kabhi bhi sie kii sevaayen nahin lee hai
 (from input language) dilli ke lokanayak aspataal main ek ward main bhartee ek bacchee kii tasviir soshal media par khaasi viral ho rahi he
 The 11-month-old has her two legs hanging in the air, it is clear in the photo that the girl has plaster on both her legs
 bacchee ke bagal main ek gudiya bhi kuch isi andaaj main leti hui he, gudiya ke bhi donon pairon main plaster laga hua he
 Apparently, the plaster in the doll's feet may seem strange to you
 lekin puri baat jaanane ke baad shaayad aapako bhi yah sthiti jaij lagane lagegi
 Actually, the 11-month-old baby girl is named Zikra Malik
 jikra khelte vakt bed se jameen par gir gai or uske pairon main gambhir chotein aa gayi
 The doctors decided to offer plaster after seeing the condition of the feet, but the girl was so nervous that her treatment was difficult for the doctors
 jikra ke parijanon ne bataaya uski gudiya uskaa pasandida khilonaa he or vah din bhar apni gudiya ke saath khelti he
 The doctors devised the trick and plastered her doll in front of the innocent before plastering her
 phir kya tha, bacchee ne aasaani se plaster lagava liya
 Now the girl and the doll will be seen in the foot number 16 of the orthopedic block of the hospital with the plaster in the legs
 tasviir viral hone ke baad zikr puure aspataal main mashhoor ho gai he
 Doctors say that most people in the hospital know her as a doll girl
 doctors ke anusaar vah agle hafte tak thik ho jaaegi
 The Maharashtra government has suffered a major setback
 public sarvice or ajukational institute main marathiyon ke 16 fisadi aarakshan ke maharashtra sarkaar ke faisle par bombai hai court ne roak laga di he
 Apart from this, the Bombay High Court has banned 5% reservation of Muslims in the public sector, while it decided to implement it in the Educational Institute
 prithviraj chavaan ne ellection se kuch samay pehle hi aarakshan par yah faisla liya tha
 The controversy has started with this decision of the Bombay High Court
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki wo is mudde ko supreme court main le jaaenge
 30 to 35 percent of the people living in Maharashtra are Marathas
 loksabhaa chunaav ke antim charan ke matdaan se pehle bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ke dwaara lagaataar aise bayaan aa rahe hai jo unki mushkilen badha rahe hai
 First Sadhvi Pragya, then Anant Hegde and then Madhya Pradesh BJP spokesperson Anil Soumitra, while giving a statement about the Nathuram godse-mahatma Gandhi controversy, described Mahatma Gandhi as the father of Pakistan
 godse par bayaanbaji ke baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki sadhvi, hegade ke bayaan kaa party se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 At the same time, BJP leader and spokesperson Anil Soumitra, who described Mahatma Gandhi as the father of Pakistan, was suspended by the party
 bataa den ki madhya pradesh ke anil saumitr ne shuukravaar subah apane fasebuk acount par likhaa, ‘rashtrapita the, lekin pakistan raashtra ke
 There were crores of sons like him in the nation of India, some worthless and some worthless
 ’ haalanki, unhone apane post main mahatma gandhi to nahin likhaa lekin sanket saaf the
 Change after suspension Anil Saumitra's tone has changed after suspension from surabijp
 anil saumitr ne kaha he ki unke man main gandhi ji ke prati atoot shraddha he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Anil Soumitra said, "I have not received the letter of suspension yet, i have come to know from the media that the party has acted on me
 karrwai kii ek prakriya hoti he party ko jab lagata he ki party ke kaaryakarta ne party kii nitiyon se hatakar koi kaam kiya he to party us par saamaanya rup se karrwai karti he, unhone jawaab maanga he or jawaab ham party ke nishtha or patibaddhta ke aadhaar par denge
 Anil Soumitra said after the suspension that 'bharatiya Janata Party and all its leaders and activists have respect for Gandhiji which is unbreakable and irrefutable
 kabhi hamane gandhiji ke bare main koi apshabd nahin kahe or gandhiji ke naam kaa kabhi durupyog nahin kiya
 He said, "my personal belief is that we rarely respect Gandhiji as much as we do
" congress ke log daawa bhale hi karte hai lekin gandhi ji ke naam kaa congress party ne durupyog kiya he apana samrajya sthapit karne ke liye
 "significantly, Anil Soumitra is the spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Madhya Pradesh
 agar unki fasebuk profile par dekhen, to madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke saath-saath kai diggaj netaaon ke saath unki tasviir dikh rahi he
 Also, there are many of his posts which can be disputed
 aakhri charan ke 19 may ko hone vaale matdaan main madhya pradesh main bhi vot daale jaaenge
 Actually, there has been a ruckus in the last two days about Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi
 pehle bijepi netaa or bhopal se ummidavaar sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne nathuram godse ko deshbhakt bataaya or uske baad centre sarkaar main mantri anant hegade ne unka bachaav kiya, haalanki baad main unhone kaha ki unka twitor hack ho gaya tha
 Sadhvi Pragya said in her statement about Nathuram that he was a patriot, is and should be
 jisapar puraa vipaksh agbabula tha, rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi samet puure vipaksh ne unke is bayaan ko khatarnaak bataaya tha
 After which he had to apologize, although the BJP distanced itself from this statement of Pragya
 vahiin, jab sadhvi ke bayaan par bavaal chal rahaa tha to modi sarkaar main mantri anant hegade ne twit kar likhaa ki is bayaan par maafee maangane kii jarurat nahin he
 Rather, he also said that Nathuram Godse would be happy with this discussion

 This is the reason why the once very strong left parties gradually weakened and today they are in a disastrous position in Indian politics
 unke paas vah takat nahin he jo ek dashak pehle thi
 Now Prakash Karat has taken a look at this and asked his party to learn from Arvind Kejriwal's party how to communicate with the youth
 unki baat pate kii he kyonki arvind kejariwal ne youth kii aawaaj sun lee thi or iskaa unhen phayda mila
 It has always been important to communicate with the youth, to stay connected with it and to pay attention to its views
 yahaan par vam dal chookte rahe jiskaa nateeja unhen bengal ke chunaav main bhugatna padaa or 34 varshon tak satta main rahane ke baad ek yuva party ke liye unhen kursi chhodani padi
 Apparently they had forgotten the youth power
 yuvaaon kii samasyaon ko samajhane or unase samvaad karne ko unhone jaruri nahin samajha
 To a large extent, the condition of the Congress also remained, which went away from the youth
 ab prakaash karat ko yah baat samaj main ai he
 He has to change his mind to win the JNU student union elections and establish his dominance in the whole of India because from there the politics of India neither starts nor ends there
 yah baat har rajaneta or dal ko yaad rakhni chahie ki bharat duniya kaa sabase yuva desh hone ja rahaa he or yahaan sabase zyada aabaadi youth kii hi hogi
 Whoever will connect with it and communicate with it will get success
 or aam aadmi party kii safalataa kaa yah bahut bada sutara rahaa he

 India won the toss in this historic 200th Test and the 100th Test match being played between the two teams and invited England to bat first
 jahir khan ne anthan ke kaaran bich main maidan chhodane se pehle elistare cook (12) or strans (22) ko out kiya, lekin jonathan traat (naabad 58) england ke bachaav main utre
 With his innings, England scored 127 runs for two wickets on the rain-affected first day
 traat ke saath duusare chor par kevin petersan 22 ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 Both of them tried to name England to a great extent on the first day by adding 65 runs for the third wicket so far
 subah halki barish ke kaaran khel aadha ghanta der se shuru hua
 Due to bad light, tea was taken a little earlier, but after that the rain came and then the game could not take place later in the day
 shaam ko saadhe chah baje khel shuru hone kii sambhaavna bani, lekin tabhi barish aa gai, jiske baad ampiron ne din kaa khel samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Zaheer and Trott were the attractions of the first day of this historic match at Lord's
 jahir ne ab tak 13
 Two wickets for 18 runs in 3 overs, while Trott, playing the first match against India, appears to be moving towards a big score after getting two lives
 jahir ko chhodkar bharat kaa koi bhi anya gendbaaj prabhaavshaalee pradarshan nahin kar paaya
 Zaheer also walked into the dressing room due to cramps in the 42nd over of the innings
 subah se hi aasmaan main badal ghire the, isliye mahendra singh dhoni ne toss jitkar pehle kshetrarakshan kaa faisla kiya
 For the record, the first fielding team at Lord's since 2000 has won five matches and lost seven
 pichley saal pehle kshetrarakshan karne vaali team teenon match main haari thi
 There was movement in the pitch and it took a lot of time for the batsmen to set foot
 straas or cook ne satark shuruyaat kii
 The first three overs went to Maiden and the first run of the series came in the form of fours
 tab cook ne praveen kii gend cat karke seemaa rekha par bheji thi
 Zaheer soon became the victim of the best in-form cook
 vah unki sidhi gend ko nahin samaj paae or use flik karne ke prayaas main pagabaadha out ho gaye
 As the ball hit his pad, Asad Rauf's finger rose on a loud appeal
 pichhali saat pariyon main yah pehla mauka tha, jabaki cook ardhashatak tak pahunchane se pehle hi pavilion laut gaye
 This made England score 19 runs for one wicket
 harbhajan 19wein over main gendbaaji ke liye bulaae gaye
 The first ball of the Turbator would have proved fatal if Rahul Dravid had taken a catch by Trott by diving in the first slip
 traat tak aath ran par khel rahe the
 Everyone was watching the fight between Strauss and Zaheer
 is match se pehle straas ne unki 290 gend kheli thi or paanch baar vah jahir ke shikaar bane the
 The England captain faced him strongly in the first season, but Zaheer managed to dismiss him early in the second season
 traat shuru main mili jeevandaan kaa phayda uthaakar apana saatvaan test ardhashatak jamaane main safal rahe
 Zaheer also troubled him a lot
 traat jab 32 ran par the, tab jahir kii gend unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar dhoni or dravid ke bich se chaar ran ke liye gai
 It could be converted into a catch
 traat ne is tarah se jahir kii 34veen gend khilne ke baad unke khilaaf pehla ran banaaya
 It was the 40th over of the innings, on whose last ball Trott took the team score to 100 runs with one run
 petersan ne 14veen gend khelkar khaataa kholaa
 He hit the ball outside the ball off Praveen's off stump and hit the first four
 tab lords kii dhalaan ne bhi gend ko seemaa rekha paar pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 His next fours also went in the same fashion off Praveen's ball
 bharat ko pari ke 42wein over main karaara jhatka laga, jab jahir anthan ke kaaran baahar chale gaye
 Praveen completed his over
 westeindies main praveen pich par daudane ke liye gendbaaji se hataaya gaya tha or ampire ne ek avasar par unhen chetavanee di
 The balls of Praveen and Ishant did not show the same West Indies movement

 jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 par apane rukh main lacheelaapan laate hue bhaajapa ne kaha ki is baat par charchaa kii jaani chahie ki is sanvaidhanik praavdhaan se rajya ko koi phayda hua he yaa nahin
 In his first rally in the state after being made bjp's prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi said that his party was discussing various aspects of the issue
 unhone bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ke vichaaron kaa samarthan kiya jisamen unhone (rajnath ne) lalkaar raily main kaha tha ki agar anuchhed 370 laabhadaayak sabit hua, tab unki party iskaa samarthan karegi
 This is against the attitude of the BJP, which was demanding complete repeal of the Article giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir in India
 is praavdhaan kaa ullekh karte hue modi ne kaha ki desh ke anya rajyon kii tulana main rajya main mahilaon ko samaan adhikaar nahin diya gaya he
 The state government figures have mentioned a record number of tourists visiting the state, although the bjp's prime ministerial candidate claimed to have affected tourism in the state
 modi ne kaha, yahaan paryaton prabhavit ho rahaa he
 Tourists are going to Himachal Pradesh
 saundarya or shraddha ke liye acha paryaton hai yahaan par
 Referring to the completion of 100 years of Hindi cinema, Modi said, a lot of films are shot here
 jammu-kashmir main kyon nahin film santhaan sthapit kiya gaya? yah dukhad he ki unki ruchi vikaas main nahin he
 He also said that to promote tourism in Ladakh region, why does the government not consider the route of Kailash Mansarobar via Leh? Earlier, BJP President Rajnath Singh while addressing the rally said that his party will raise the subject of the border agreement with China in Parliament
 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne kaha, haal hi main pradhanmantri manmohan singh china gaye the, jahaan unhone china ke saath seemaa sahyog samjhauta kiya tha, jisamen kai vivaadaaspad upbandh hai
 He said that the Prime Minister did not think it necessary to take Parliament into confidence before reaching a compromise
 andhvishwaas hamaare desh kii badi samasya he
 Here, every human being considers one thing or other to be a key to his / her luck
 lekin kya ho agar ye lack kaa raita itnaa fail jaae ki aapkaa jeena mushkil ho jaae? sonam kapur or dulkar salmaan kii ye film aapako yahi bataati he
 The film, based on writer Anuja Chauhan's book The Zoya Factor, is about the story of Zoya Solanki (sonam Kapoor), who was born on 25 June 1983
 tabhi se joya ke pita (sanjay kapur) use cricket kaa lucky charm maanate hai
 Zoya's father and brother (sikander Kher) are big fans of cricket and Zoya has been playing cricket matches since childhood
 joya ek aid agency main kaam karti he or apni kismat ko kaaphi had tak kosti rahati he
 But then he finds a project that changes his fortunes and Zoya becomes India's lucky charm
 itnaa hi nahin indian cricket team kaa captain or joya ke sapanom kaa rajkumaar nikhil khodaa (dulkar salmaan) bhi uske pyaar main pad jaataa he
 But it is said that with great power comes big responsibilities and troubles
 to bas ab joya ko in mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa he or apana pyaar bhi bachaana he
 The story of this film is very simple
 do log jo ek duusare se pyaar karte hai, ek cricket team jo lack or andhvishwaas main vishwaas rakhti he or ek ladki ek villen
 Now what can go wrong in such a situation? sabakuch to nahin par bahut kuch
 In the film, Sonam Kapoor plays Zoya Solanki, who is lucky for cricket but her own luck is a bit bad
 joya chulabuli he, mastamaula he or munhfat bhi
 Zoya's character is exactly like you can imagine Sonam Kapoor comfortably
 sonam kapur kaa kaam bhi kaaphi acha he
 But there is a shortcoming in it
 joya ke kirdaar main sonam aapako kuch nayaa nahin detii
 You definitely remember the film Sundar Ki Miley after seeing him
 vahiin dulkar salmaan film kii asli majboot kadi hai
 Discussions of his acting, his voice and his hotness are going to happen after this film
 aise bahut se seens hai jahaan dulkar sirf apane exprations se baat karte hai or aapkaa dil chura lete hai
 Angad Bedi is a wonderful villain
 sanjay kapur or sikandar kher bhi is film main hai, lekin afsos unhen bahut kuch karne ko nahin mila
 The rest of the supporting actors of the film did their job well
 iske alaava film main chemiyo bhi achche the
 Director Abhishek Sharma could have made this simple story a bit better
 romance unhone thikthak dikhaaya lekin film ko wo puri tarah se jod nahin paae
 However, the cricket match shown in the second half of the film gives you the feel of a real cricket match
 ye ek romantic kamedi film he, jiske jokes bahut achche nahin hai
 More than jokes in the film, you will laugh at people's antics
 mana ki film main joya solanki ek aid agency main kaam karti he lekin iskaa matlab ye to nahin ki puri film main aid hi aid bhari honi jaruri he
 The costumes of Sonam's character are very good
 sonam or dulkar kii chemistry thik thi
 The songs of the film are good, but these songs make you nervous in almost every other scene
 joya factor kii apni alag acchhee baaten hai
 Some of the sequences of the film are good, but still a bit short
 maharashtra main devendra fadanvis ne phir lee siem pad kii shapanjit pavaar bane dipti siem, vipaksh ke mansoobon par phiraa panishnivaar kii subah jab suraj uga to maano maharashtra kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal hi aa gaya
 The leaders of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, who are planning the formation of government formation till Friday night, may not realize from anywhere that when they wake up in the morning, all the plans, equations, blueprints and common minimum programs will be seen in the corner
 devendra fadanvis aurensipi netaa ajit pavaarane rajbhavan main mukhyamantri or upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 After this, Fadnavis said that people had given us a clear majority
 lekin shivasena ne nateezon ke duusari partiyon ke saath gathbandhan karne kii koshish kii
 Because of this, President's rule came into force in the state
 maharashtra ko sthir sarkaar kii jarurat he, khichdi sarkaar kii nahin
 At the same time, Ajit Pawar said that from the day of the result, no party was able to form the government
 maharashtra kii janata ko kaaphi pareshaani ho rahi thi, jisamen kisaan bhi shaamil the
 So we decided to form the government
 piem modi or shah ne di badhaishapath grahan samaaroh ke baad piem narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah ne fadanvis or ajit pavaar ko badhai di
 Apart from both top leaders, other BJP leaders also congratulated the BJP government in Maharashtra
 sharad pavaar par singhvi kaa tanjamaharashtra main khiski jameen par congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi ne sharad pavaar par jamkar tanj ksaa
 He wrote in the tweet, initially it was fake news
 lekin teenon partiyon kii baatcheet 3 din se zyada nahin honi chahie thi
 Pawar ji, you are great
 haalanki baad main sharad pavaar ke safai dene ke baad unhone twit hataa liya
 Sources for mla's support letter Fadnavis said, the support letters signed by NCP mlas were with Ajit Pawar
 samarthan patr par kise samarthan dena he, wo jagah khali padi thi kyonki siem kaa naam tay nahin tha abhi or mana ja rahaa he ki usee letters ko ajit pavaar ne fadanvis ke paksh main istemaal kar liya
 Pawar said - This is not the decision of NCP, after Ajit Pawar's decision to go with Fadnavis, a statement was issued by Sharad Pawar

 centre or maharashtra main sattarudh endie ke ghatak shivasena ne do din pehle kaha tha ki eendhan ke zyada daam desh main kisaanon kii khudakushi kaa mukhya kaaran he
 On the other hand, the party's mouthpiece Saamana said in an editorial on Wednesday, "those who are in the government do not want to talk on inflation nor allow others to talk
" eendhan ke daam aasmaan par pahunchane kaa dard aam aadmi jhel rahaa he
 It is not true if the people sitting in the government support 20 times its price increase during the last four months
 'isse pehle party ne kendriya mantri alphons kannanthanam ke us bayaan ko aam aadmi kaa 'apmaan' bataaya tha or kaha tha ki bina yogyata or logon se judaav vaale log desh chalaa rahe hai

 railveke liye 2018-19 ke bajet main kaaphi kuch diya gaya lekin bahut si baaten chipa bhi lee gayi
 Railways did not give information about the performance of the last financial year
 kyon nahin di, isliye ki bataane se fajihat hogi
 a lot of money is invested in the railways, but still it has not been brought into profit as per expectations
 isaki bahut sari vajahen he
 In the current budget, the central government separately set the railways 1
 48 lakh karod rupye dene kii baat kahi lekin isamen se aadhi se zyada rakam railway ko khud hi jutani hogi
 Obviously it will be raised from debt
 karj lenaa koi buree baat nahin he lekin use aise nivesh karnaa chahie ki paisa chukaaya bhi ja sake
 This is where the railway eats
 darasal, railway kaa har project phydemand nahin hota, ritern saalon baad aata he
 Usually 18-20% returns in a business but not with the railways
 isamen kaaphi kam ritern miltaa he or sarkaar bhi is ore kam hi dhyaan detii he
 According to railway experts, laying of lines in new areas only gives very low or negative returns
 2018-19 ke bajet main nai linon par 28490 karod rupye kii rakam kharch kii jaaegi
 Apart from this, there is also a loss in gauge conversion and the railway is doing both of these things indiscriminately
 har zyaadaatar rajyon main ye donon kaam jamkar ho rahe hai
 Obviously, the railway will not be professional until these things are done after seeing the economic results
 railway ke parfarmens kii koi jaankaree nahin di
 No information from last year
 paisanger trephic nahin bad rahaa he
 Income is increasing by five-six percent
 malbhaade main badhotaree jarur hui he lekin isaki growth bhi kareeb 5 percent ke aasapaas hi he, jo ki pichley saal ke mukaable thik kahi ja sakati he
 But the freight from the railways proves to be very expensive
 road transport is maamle main railway par baari pad rahaa he
 Railways also do not have capacity
 is bajet main growth badhaane kaa koi rodmap nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 The cost of railway is also increasing due to increase in salary
 aisi sthiti main revenue badhaakar hi railway ko phaayde main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Buying an engine-wagon for the railways is a profitable deal as it increases its capacity immediately
 2018-19 main railway 700 ingine, 12000 wagon or 5160 coach kharidne ja rahaa he
 Railways are going to spend more than 32 thousand crores on rolling stock, which will definitely benefit them
 lekin isamen railway kii patariyaan baadhak hai
 The burden on the rail tracks is 40 percent more than their capacity
 dilli-mumbai or dilli-kolkata fret coridor kii baat karen to is par kaam 2005 se chal rahaa he lekin ye 2019 kii apni dedline tak ban jayega aisa dikhaai nahin detaa
 Currently, the speed of Goods trains on both these routes does not exceed 25 kilometers per hour
 coridor ban jane ke baad mukhya linon par boj kaaphi kam ho jayega
 On Friday, 9 February 2018, MP in the Rajya Sabha Derek o'brien questioned the provisions made in the budget for the Railways
 unhone sawaal kiya ki aakhir sarkaar railway ke khaali kareeb paune do lakh padon ko kyon nahin bhar rahi he
 Apart from this, he also accused the states of allocating projects and funds to politics
 unke sawaal main se sirf ek kaa railmantri ne jawaab diya or kaha ki pa

 Surgical system or surgery, one of the eight branches of Ayurveda, is an extremely important and useful discipline right from the beginning
 varanasi ke maharaja kashiraj divodas dhanvantari ayurveda main shalya sampradaay ke janak rahe hai
 Acharya Sushruta (500 AD) pus
 ) Kashiraj was chief among the seven disciples of Divodas Dhanvantari
 unhone kaashi (varanasi) main shalya chikitsa sikhi or chikitsa kaary kiya
 He composed the Sushruta Samhita, one of the most important texts of Ayurveda, which gives useful information on the basic principles of surgery
 unhone kai shalya chikitsaaon se judi kargar vidhi or takanic ke bare main vistaar se likhaa he
 Rebuilding the damaged nose (rhinoplasty), re-fixing the ear flame (lobuloplasty), removal of urinary sac stones, laparotomy and cesarean section, wound healing, burns, broken bone additions, any internal abscess, intestine and Treatments associated with urinary sac perforation, enlargement of prostate, discovery of effective method of treatment of hemorrhoids, fistula, etc
, show their efficiency in surgery
 sushrut ke dizin kiye hue sargical upkarnaksharkarm, agnikarm or jaluka avacharan unke khoje upachaar kii anya vidhiyaan hai jo kai aisi bimariyon ko bhi thik kar sakati hai jinke ilaaj ke liye surgery hi ekmaatr vikalp samajha jaataa he
 He developed more than 100 developed medical tools in six different categories and 20 types of edged surgical instruments used in various surgeries
 iske saath-saath vibhinn suiyaan or taanke lagane main kaam aane vaale resham or linen ke dhaage, paudhon ke reshe or koshika utak bhi dizin kiya
 He used ant-jaw surgery in intestinal perforation as a naturally dissolving clip, demonstrating his foresight in the use of new experiments and techniques
 ve pehle vyakti the jinhone netra rachana vigyaan, netra kii vyaadhiyon or netra chikitsa par charchaa kii
 Weakness of eyes, white part of cataract surgery, problems related to eyelid eyelids and many other eye diseases and their method of diagnosis
 unhone kaan, naak or gale main hone vaali vibhinn bimariyon or unki chikitsa ke bare main bhi vistaar se varnan kiya he
 He is also called the 'father of surgery', given his matchless contribution in the field of surgery and his work in the field of other fundamentals of Ayurveda
 haalanki shalya chikitsa ke kshetra main unka yogadan sarvaadhik he, par unhone streerog, prasuti chikitsa or shishu chikitsa prabandhan main bhi mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Surgery was a major practice in Ayurveda during Sushruta's time
 lekin samay ke saath shalya chikitsa kaa prayog kam hota chalaa gaya
 The teaching of Ayurvedic system of medicine in universities started in 1927 from Banaras Hindu University
 phir 1964 main ayurveda main post grajuation kii padhai kii shuruyaat hui to aadhunik yug main ayurveda main shalya chikitsa ke prayog kaa daur aarambh hua
 Many renowned Ayurvedic surgeons joined the university and made commendable contribution in the field of teaching, training, research and use of surgical system in Ayurveda

 udupa ke yogya netritv main 1970 ke dashak main ayurveda or aadhunik medicine, donon kaa hi bharpoor vikaas hua
 Many important steps were taken in this process of revival of surgery in Ayurveda
 -kai pracheen shalya chikitsa siddhant evam darshan ko sthapit karnaa-sushrut samhita jaise ayurveda ke pracheen or mahatvapurn granth main varnit shalya prakriya or takanic ko prayog main laana-shalya karm ke jariye thik hone vaale rogon main ayurveda kii vishisht chikitsa karm or aushadhi se chikitsa karnaa-jin bimariyon ke liye shalya kriya kii jarurat hoti he, unke sthaan par ksharkarm, agnikarm or jaluka avacharan jaise upachaar, jo bas ayurveda main hi hai or inke prayog se shalya kriya se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Some of the various surgical procedures practiced in Ayurveda are recognized globally and treatment of disease like alkali or fistula is one of the best and effective examples
 bhagandar kaa ksharsutra upachaargudamarg or gudadwar kii bahari sataha ke bich ek puraani sujan ke kaaran ek asaamaanya suraakh ban jane ko guda kaa bhagandar kehete hai
 The most prevalent remedy for this disease is surgery
 guda ke bhagandar ke upachaar ke liye aadhunik surgery main kai upkaran or nai takanic ke aane se ilaaj zyada aadhunik to ho gaya he lekin iskaa antim parinaam ab bhi bahut santoshprad nahin he, kyonki surgery ke baad bhi beemaari phir se ubhar aati he
 Also, there are major problems such as shrinkage of the stool gate, loss of control when stool is prevented due to damage during surgery
 kai baar to ye pareshaaniyaan mul beemaari se zyada gambhir ho jaati hai
 a unique treatment method for fistula of the anus has been described in Ayurveda
 ek aushadhiyukt dhaagaa—ksharsutra ko bhagandar kshetra main baandha jaataa he
 Gradually, it cuts and separates the entire labyrinth area and cures the disease without causing any damage to the narrowing muscles of the anal passage
 upachaar kii is takanic ko banaras hindu uniwarsity ke shalya tantra vibhaag ne phir se sthapit kiya or ise kendriya ayurveda shodh parishad (sisiareyes) evam bhartiya ayurvigyaan anusandhan parishad (isimr) dwaara vidhivat manyata pradaan kii gai
 Kshatrasutra is a medicinal thread (chemical light) made by mixing the components of flora, plants, plants, palash, neem, etc
 with other plants like Guggalu and Haridra
 shalya kaary main prayukt hone vaale linen ke dhaage par in avyavon ko baar-baar lapetakar ise upachaar main prayog ke yogya banaaya jaataa he
 The success rate of treatment in the case of normal and small labyrinths is 100 per cent and its success rate in the treatment of complex, old and re-emergent Bandicoots varies from 93 to 97 per cent
 is vidhi se 40,000 se zyada rogiyon kaa safaltaapurvak upachaar banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke es
 s
 aspataal ke guda va malashay rog vibhaag main kiya ja chukaa he
 Recognizing the benefits of this treatment method, the Ministry of AYUSH in 2013 on Banaras Hindu University's Sir Sunderlal Hospital (S
W
 es
 Hospital) has established a National Resource Center
 yah centre gudamarg or malashay main aamtaur par hone vaali bimariyon, jisamen bhagandar bhi shaamil he, ke upachaar se sambandhit sabhi moolbhoot or aadhunik suvidhaon se las he
 Piles is also another common problem and more than 10 crore Indians are victims of this disease
 ayurveda main kabj or aanton se judi pareshaaniyon ko jad se mitaane ke liye bahut-si aushadhiy vanaspatiyaan bataai gai hai
 The use of alkali and the application of alkali (lei derived from medicinal plants) on the affected area and separating the piles of warts are very effective ways to cure this disease
 shalya kriya main ghaav kaa upachaar bhi ek anya kshetra he jisamen ayurveda kaa yogadan asaadhaaran he
 Over 100 methods and a wide range of medicines are available in the form of powders, pastes, fresh leaf juices, ointments, and medicinal oils and ingredients made from ghee, which are used to heal old and not easily healing wounds
 
 aasaani se nahin sookhne vaale ghaav ke upachaar kaa ayurveda kaa moolbhoot siddhant he- dusht vran (ghaav) ko shuddh vran main parivartit kar diya jaae
 For this, many types of medicines are required at different levels
 dusht vran yaa kharaab ghaav aamtaur par nirjeev uttakon se bhare aise sankramit ghaav hote hai jisase durgandh or mawaad aati he
 Vegetables like Neem, Karanja, Papaya, Daruharidra etc
 convert the wicked ulcer into pure ulcer, hence they are also called ulcer cleansing medicines
 jabaki chameli, haridra, manjistha, durva, chandan ghaavon ko tivrata se bharne main sahyogi hote hai isliye inhen vran ropan dawaaen kaha jaataa he
 There are also some medicines that are useful in both stages of wound healing
 panchvalkal (panch-paanch, valkal-chaal) jo ayurveda main ghaav bharne hetu laabhakaari prabhaav ke liye varnit he, main vat, udubanr, pipal, parish or palaksh jaise paanch paudhon kii chaal shaamil hai
 These plants are commonly and abundantly available throughout the country
 is yogic dawa kaa vaigyanik maanakon par moolyankan kiya gaya or paaya gaya ki dawa sookshmjivon kii vruddhi ko rokatii he, nai rakt vahika ke gathan ko badhaati he, colejan sanshleshan main vruddhi karti he or ghaav ke twarit upachaar ke liye jaruri karkon ko badhaati he
 Since both technology and medicines are available in plenty in our country, treatment with this method has become much cheaper than importing dressing materials from abroad
 jonk kaa prayog ek anya para sargical takanic he jiskaa ayurvedic sarjan nahin sookhne vaale ghaavon ko thik karne ke saath hi saath plastic surgery main twachaa ko jodgaye main prayog karte hai
 There are special species of jokes which are not toxic in nature
 inkaa prayog sankramit ghaav ke chaaron taraf se aavashyaktaa anusaar rakt ko chuskar nikaalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This increases blood circulation and helps in healing the wound faster
 jonk kaa prayog ejima or ganjepan jaisi bimariyon ko thik karne main bhi bahut kargar he
 Ayurveda describes several other non-surgical experiments that have been scientifically assessed
 prostate bad jaae to iske upachaar ke liye surgery hi ekmaatr rasta bataaya jaataa tha
 In its place, experimentation has proved that medicinal enema as well as Gokshuradi Guggul and Varuna are useful in healing the prostate, which are the drinkable drugs
 varun, gokshur, pashanbhed mutrashay kii pathari ko thik karne main bade kargar bataae jate hai
 These drugs prevent the formation of stones in the urine bag and eliminate the possibility of re-stones after surgery
 mutr stant mutrvahini main rakhaa patala tub hota he
 These ayurvedic medicines are helpful in keeping the urinary stent effective for a long time and preventing the accumulation of salts within the stent after it is placed in the bladder
 haddi se judi bimariyon ko thik karne main ayurvedic sarjanon kaa yogadan saraahneey he
 There are some educational institutions as well as private practitioners who deal with bone-related cases, especially those related to bone fractures, lower back pain, disc dislocation and other chronic diseases
 iske alaava, kuch vishesh upkarnon dwaara agnikarm or raktamoshan kuch duusare upaay hai jo mansapeshiyon ke puraane dard kaa nivaaran karne main bade prabhavi hai
 Ayurvedic surgeons of gynecology and ophthalmology trained in the operation of Ayurveda also perform surgery in their respective fields
 ve ayurveda main varnit upachaar kii kuch vishesh takanic ke alaava saamaanya strirogon or prasavottar surgery karne main sakasham hai
 Ayurvedic eye surgeons are capable of performing common eye surgeries such as cataract removal, as well as other eye surgeries
 ayurveda main netrarog se judi vishesh kriyaaon ko kriyakalp ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Activity is a special process by which successful treatment of various retinal problems and other chronic eye diseases is done
 haalanki ayurveda main shalya chikitsa kii shuruyaat aazaadee ke baad ke daur main banaras hindu uniwarsity main shalya tantra kii post grajuation kii padhai or prashikshan ke dwaara shuru kii gai lekin baad main ise kai anya shikshan sansthaanon main bhi shuru kiya gaya
 Now post graduation teaching in Ayurveda is conducted by CCIM and AYUSH Ministry of Government of India, many other reputed institutes have also started post graduation ie MS (ayurveda) studies in surgical system
 shalya tantra main post grajuation prashikshan teen saal kaa hota he jo ki ayurveda main grajuation ke baad kiya ja saktaa he
 Today, without safe anesthesia and life support system, surgery cannot be thought of and this applies to Ayurvedic surgery as well
 ise banaras hindu uniwarsity main samajha gaya or ayurveda main anaesthesia kii shuruyaat kii gai or baad main sisiiem ne ayurveda vibhaag main bhi anaesthesiology main post grajuation course shuru kiya
 These were catering to the needs of Ayurvedic surgeons in Ayurvedic institutes and private institutions, but abruptly discontinuing the Post Graduation Course (anesthesia) in Ayurveda on anesthesia has pushed the work being done towards the specialization of surgery in Ayurveda and This topic requires immediate attention
 sankshep main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki ayurveda main shalya chikitsa kaa prayog pracheen kaal main bahut lokapriy tha
 Eminent scholars of Banaras Hindu University paved the way for surgery in Ayurveda in the 1960s but for many reasons it has not yet achieved its high potential
 ayurveda main shalya chikitsa ke vikaas ke liye aadhunik takanic evam suvidhaon ke bharpoor samarthan ke saath-saath nirantar anveshan va shodh kii aavashyaktaa he taaki ayurveda main shalya chikitsa ke dhoomil pade gaurav ko punah sthapit kiya ja sake or maanav kalyaan main iskaa behatar prayog sambhav ho sake
 The author of the important text of Acharya Sushrutaayurveda, Sushruta Samhita, has described in detail several methods of the Banaras Hindu University Ayurveda The study of medical system started in 1927 and post-graduation in 1964 after independence
 ab desh ke kai vishvavidhyalayon main isaki vyavastha haisahaj ilajayurveda main shalya kriya se bhagandar or kai guda rogon kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 Foreign doctors of modern medicine are also training this method developed in India with the help of some species of nature helpers to cure serious diseases *** iaiti hyderabad main non teaching post ke liye 82 padon par bhartiyon jari kii gai hai

 # TZH India has unfortunately never been able to get rid of the habit of being person centered
 media se lekar raajnneeti tak, cinema se lekar kala tak kuch vyaktiyon ke ird-gird hi hamaari kahani shuru hokar anjaam paa jaati he
 The latest case is that of the surreal voices raising in favor and opposition of Bollywood superstar Salman Khan
 is maamle main jis kism kaa jashn dekhne ko mila he, vah chintaa kaa sabab he
 Nothing happened in the Salman Khan case, which is new to this country
 ek taqatvar vyakti kanoon kaa istemaal apane paksh main karne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he
 We have seen these examples ever since we have sensed
 salmaan khan naam kaa abhinayta sharaab ke nashe main footpath par so rahe logon ke upar gaadi chadha detaa he
 As a result, a poor sleeping person dies
 sadak durghatnakoi mahaan aashcharya nahin he
 She has also done with Salman
 lekin cinemai parde par majaluumon kii madad karne vaala nayak durghatana ke baad ghatnasthal par rukta nahin he
 runs away
 khayr parde or asli chhavi main fark hota he
 Obviously, Salman is also not as great as shown on screen
 ghatnasthal se bhaag janaa na sirf aapraadhik galati thi, balki samvedanheenata bhi
 Then think for a moment and in India, unfortunately this is what happens in most cases after the accident
 salmaan main bhi aam logon jaisi kamajori bahut hairat kii baat nahin he
 People often escape by taking advantage of their influence in these cases
 salmaan pichley17 saal se jamaanat parachal rahe hai
 He can raise an army of lawyers
 salmaan ko unke mahange vakil ab tak bachaate bhi rahe hai
 This time too, he has done this for some time
 jinhone bhi salmaan ke kariyar ko gaur se dekha, ho unhen yah andaja lagane main khaas mushkil nahin hogi ki bigadel sitare se sabaki madad karne valabde dil kaa 'bhaijan'banane kii prakriya kab shuru hui
 Salman's friend and famous actor Sanjay Dutt, who was accused of anti-national activities, had a similar case with him
 donon hi sitaron ne court-kachhari ke chakkar main padane ke baad apni chhavi badali
 Gradually, the nature of the news related to these stars changed
 achaanak se salmaan or sanjay dutt kii chhavi ek madadgaar shaks kii banane lagi
 This is the truth or just PR (public relation), it can be found only by going deep into the investigation
 yah bhi kam dilachasp sanyog nahin he ki is madadgaar chhavi ko bhunaane kii koshish donon sitaron ne apane adalati maamalon main bhi kii
 Salman Khan went to jail for the first time in 1998
 is ghatana ko ek dashakar biit gaya
 Social media emerged as revolution
 har nayak kii chhavi ko isane khangaalana shuru kiya
 With the advent of social media, many people hoped that now stars able to manage media will not trick people
 lekin salmaan ke maamle par jis tarah se log, buddhijivi or soshal media bhi unki aarti utaarne main laga rahaa yah ek asahaj karne vaali sthiti thi
 For a superstar who has been declared a criminal by the court, the absence of educated people is a weak position for reasoning
 salmaan ko soshal media ne bhi kade sawaalon se batch jane diya
 Most of the voices other than sporadic voices were in his favor
 salmaan kii 'beeing human' vaali chhavi unka sabase bada sahaara sabit hui
 After the creation and use of this image one must also think whether this image is also a lie
 salmaan kii dariyaadilii ke kisse unke kareebi logon ke hi jariye hamaare saamne aae hai
 Social media has given people a big platform to speak their words
 lekin kya iskaa arth yah he ki handalati maamalonki bhi izzat nahin karenge
 Every voice raised with or against Salman was delivering verdicts like an independent court
 kya bhartiya yuva varg jo padhaa-likhaa he, itani maamuli si baat bhi nahin samajhataa
 Consider Salman's programs and his titles
 desh kaa sabase bada faisla
 What really! Nothing much has happened in this country in the last few days
 salmaan ko hoicourt ne jamaanat de di he
 He has not yet been absolved
 jamaanat par jis kism kaa jashn manaaya ja rahaa he vah kahin se uchit nahin jaan padataa
 Millions of Salman's fans are being taken care of by him
 itane bade jansailab ke nayak salmaan par kya yah naitik dabaav bhi hoga ki vah sach (jo bhi sach ho) sweekaar kar len
 This case will also be monitored so that it can be seen whether such powerful people will be able to escape from the grip of the judiciary
 For another reason, this matter should be monitored as to how people make a difference between criminal and celebrity criminal cases

 congress kii sahyogi rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki gujarat dangon ke aarope se ab narendra modi ko supreme court ne bari kar diya he or desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko yah sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 Commenting on this, Union Minister and NCP leader Praful Patel said that now Modi should stop being questioned in connection with the post-godhra riots
 patel ke mutabik ham us yug main hai jab kisi bhi mudde par nyaayik pranali ko nyaay paane kaa antim rasta maanate hai or agar usne koi faisla diya he to hamen iskaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 We will not question it further
 vah un sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the jisamen congress netaa rahul gandhi ne ek televijan saakshaatkaar ke dauraan gujarat ke mukhyamantri par aarope lagaae ki rajya main 2002 ke dangon ko sarkaar bhadkaa rahi thi
 Patel said that in the interview a person can present his views but politics is not only on the thinking of the leaders but also on the thinking of the people
 ensipi netaa ne kaha, lekin tathy he ki agar nyaayik pranali ne kisi vivaad ko antim viraam diya he to hamen ise vahiin rahane dena chahie

 Singer Balaram Arya was singing in Bhajjic style
 mohana, faridabad main block str kii ek sabha main bhupendra singh hooda ko sunne aae bujurg log markat vaali raajnneeti ke is daur main satvik hone lage
 This was the same singer whom i had seen and heard singing a day before at Narendra Modi's rally in Faridabad
 tab balram aryaa kii mandali ke sabhi sadasyon ke sir par rangeen pagadi thi or sabhi kalafadaar safed kurta pahane hue the
 Their platform was raised high for Narendra Modi's rally, so that people can see and swing away from them
 pradhanmantri kii raily main in kalakaaron kaa sur uthaan par tha
 Songs were also chosen from which to create excitement
 congress kii sabha main yahi kalakaar ga rahe the, magar gaanon kii aakraamakata gaayab thi
 The stage was built quite low
 maine balram aryaa se poocha to kaha ki donon kii raajnneetik samskritiyaan alag hai
 We have an affinity for the Congress candidate, but the heart gets with the BJP, so singing in their rally creates excitement
 in baton ke sandarbh main main yaad karne laga ki pradhanmantri kii raily main gaae gaye geeton ke bol or bhav kya the or congress kii raily main kya gaaya ja rahaa he
 The heroes of the 1857 revolution were being celebrated there
 rani lakshmibai kii shahadat kaa bakhaan karte hue aise hi swaabhaavik rup se urja aa jaati he
 All the songs were from Veer Ras
 ek hi gayak or ek hi prishthbhumi ke geeton ke antar se aap congress or bhaajapa kii reliyon main aae netaaon or samarthakon kii deh bhashaa ko bhaanp sakate hai
 There is a white kurta in the Congress rally, but the kurta has lost its shine
 aisa laga ki kaaryakarta ne pichley din kaa kurta pahan rakhaa he
 At the BJP rally, the workers saw that their victory was certain, so everyone was seen in new kurta or Dhule kurta
 congressi sabhaaon kaa aayojan saadagi ke naam par udaseenta se bharaa hua laga, jabaki bhaajapai sabhaaon kaa aayojan urja ke naam par theatrenuma
 The Congress will soon have to take the rallies seriously
 is maamle main bijepi se sikh lene main koi buraai nahin he
 The BJP has not left Ram's strategy to contest elections at the ground level
 usne ek-ek voter kii gheraabandi kar lee he
 Strategies have been chalked out from district to block level
 har kaaryakarta ke paas koi na koi kaam he, lakshya he
 The party has become modish, but the BJP has also become a professional party
 bijepi ke iti cell ke sadasyon ne bataaya ki faridabad main ghar−ghar jaakar, parkon main jaakar logon se phone number liye gaye
 We even asked that if we do SMS then there will be no problem
 logon ke number dene ke bhav se pataa chalata gaya ki saamne vaala bijepi ko kitna pasand karata he
 The IT cell is not a visible unit in the BJP
 iti cell ke sadasyon ne bataaya ki pehle ham iti cell kaa udghaatan khud hi karte the, magar is baar rohtak main jab 'waar-room' bana to udghaatan main 1,500 netaa-kaaryakarta aa gaye
 Every big leader was present there
 bijepi kii kisi bhi sabha main jaaie, iti cell kii team vyavasthit rup se prachaar kaary main lagi hoti he
 i did not find anyone in the congress meeting who is doing IT work
 kabhi-kabhaar hi takaraate hai
 Bhupendra Hooda started his speech only by saying that there is an election
 saare dal vaale aaenge, apni baat kahenge
 Listen to everyone bijepi ke netaa kehete hai ki kisi or ko mat suno
 Just listen to BJP and choose BJP
 yah thik he ki hooda ne desi andaaz main chutkiyaan leen, magar bhaashanbaazi main congressi netaa pichad rahe hai
 There was no boon to defeat anyone
 daavedaari main dam nahin tha
 Where BJP leaders shout, Congressmen cry

 The police had accused Kaluram Sen, Batesingh Dangi, Ramesh Dangi, Mukesh Dangi and Atralia, a Dalit Ramchandra resident, of the murder
 gavaahi ke dauraan adaalat ko netraheen ramkishan ne aropiyon kii aawaaj pahachaanate hue bataaya ki uskaa bhai gangaaprasad ghatana kii raat inhi ke saath tha
 This made it clear that Gangaprasad was present with the accused on the night of the incident

 17 november ko ghoshnaa hoti he ki jinke gharon main shaadi he wo apane bank se dhai lakh rupee nikaal sakate hai
 As soon as this news came, those who had weddings in their homes ran towards the banks
 awwal to unhen bhi usee line se guzaranaa padaa jo hoti to lambii he, magar usamen lage sabhi ko paise nahin milte the
 When the wedding house reached the manager with the card, in many places the manager started answering that we do not have two and a half lakh rupees to give and in this way the guideline has not been reached to give them the money
 tivi par elaan ho jane se koi paisa kaise degaa, jab tak manager ke paas likhit nirdesh nahin pahonchega
 Therefore, the disappointed people also suspected these news and decisions
 4 din tak afratfari rahi tab jaakar bhartiya reserve bank ne 19 november ko kaha ki bank agle hafte se ye paisa dena shuru karen, jab unhen guideline mil jaaegi
 On November 21, the RBI issued a notification to the guidelines that banks sent to them, adding to the problems of married households
 pehali shart ye thi ki 30 disambar tak shaadi vaale ghar ke log paisa nikaal sakate hai, lekin utana hi paisa nikaal sakate hai jitna unke khate main 8 november tak jamaa hoga
 Not only this, the parents of the bride or groom or the bride and groom themselves will go to the bank to withdraw money
 duulhaa-dulhan ke parivaar alag-alag dhai lakh hi nikaal sakenge
 Anyone who has made this guideline feels that he has not been in a wedding for a long time, nor has he been married to anyone
 par aisa to ho hi nahin saktaa he
 The problem of married families is not just to replace old notes
 jo jamaa he use nikaalnaa bhi he
 Marriage should be done with simplicity but whether it will be decided by the people or by demonetisation
 agar notebandi kaa yah bhi makasad he to ise agle lagan main bhi lagu kar dena chahie
 Until this happens, no one has the right to get their money, whether they spend it or not
 yahi nahin shaadi byaah kii apni ek arthvyavastha hoti he
 This helps many types of employment
 wo sab thapp se pad gaye
 If the bride-groom stays in the bank's line for hours or their parents stay with the Reserve Bank's guidelines, then who will look after the rest of the preparatory work
 bahut se log shaadi ke liye udhaar lete hai, ghar bechate hai
 How will all this money be deposited in the bank
 agar koi electronic tareeke se america se dilli ke khate main jamaa bhi kar de to bhi wo paisa nahin nikaala ja sakegaa
 The government is deciding how much money you will withdraw from your account, because 86 percent of the notes have not been displaced by the new notes
 sharton kii gaadi yahi nahin rukii
 Own 2 5 lakh nikaalane ke liye catarrs, tent vaale yaa marij home ko jo advance diya hoga uski raseed bhi deni hogi
 The one who is married in the house will have to give an affidavit that cash amount has been given to those who do not have a bank account
 jaise aap mandap sajaane ke liye phuulavaale ko tabhi is dhai lakh main se de sakenge, jab uske paas koi bank khaataa nahin hoga
 This means that if the florist has a bank account, he will have to give it by check
 yahi nahin bank ko saare dastavej sambhaal kar rakhane honge
 The Reserve Bank of India has issued another circular on 22 November
 21 november kaa circular hi maanya he, bas isamen ek baat yah jodi gai he ki jis insaan ko das hazaar yaa usase zyada nagad dene hai, unheen kaa hi naam bank main jamaa karaane hai
 The work of bankers has also increased a lot
 is bahaane har manager hamaare samaaj kii jo sachai dekh rahaa hoga, wo adbhut hoga
 i hope a manager will pen these experiences
 samajashastri ko gum-gum kar shaadiyon kii ricarding kerani chahie ki is vakt bharat main lakhon shaadiyon kaise ho rahi hai
 There are 25 to 30 thousand weddings a day in Delhi
 ab aate hai kisaanon kii samasya par
 The Finance Minister has also said that our next thrust will be on rural areas, then we also focus on farmers
 november se 15 disambar kaa maheene rabi kii fasal kii buvaai kaa hota he
 Wheat is the main crop in Rabi
 lekin ilaake ke hisaab se log rabi ke sizan main jau, chanaa, aalu or masoor bhi bote hai
 During this time, not only seeds, but also manure is needed
 iske liye kisaan dhan bechakar purana karj chukaate hai or nayaa karj lete hai
 Due to demonetisation, farmers cannot buy seeds, fertilizers and medicines from the cooperative bank nor can take loans
 zila kooparative bank or primary agricultural credit sosayadi ke note badalane, jamaa karne or nikaalane par roak he
 If they do not have new notes, where will they pay money on withdrawal? urban kooparative bank bhi noton kii kami kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Cooperative banks not only work for banks, but also for medicine, fertilizer and seed shops
 kooparative bank kisaanon kii life line hai
 The Mumbai District Cooperative Bank has filed a petition in the High Court that the Reserve Bank has arbitrarily excluded district cooperative banks from the process
 buvaai kaa vakt 15 disambar tak he isliye sarkaar or kisaan ke paas abhi bhi ek-do haftaa he kuch karne ke liye
 If there is a lot of delay, the yield of wheat will increase, but the quality will deteriorate
 rigerv bank ne kaha he ki zila kooparative bank or piesies kisaanon ko bataaen ki ve apane khate se har hafte 24,000 rupee nikaal sakate hai, lekin in bainkon kii shikaayat he ki unhen note nahin mil rahe hai
 We spoke to some people of the Ghaziabad District Cooperative Bank to find out what the impact has been on the farmers due to lack of new notes or non-exchange of permission
 is bank ke do-teen zilon main 33 branch hai or saadhe teen lakh kisaan iske sadsy hai ghaziabad ko 4 karod rupee hi alag-alag bainkon se mili hai
 The new note is not getting enough
 29 branchon kaa aankada bataata he ki abhi tak 1 karod 34 lakh kaa hi lone banta he, jabaki pichley saal 8 se 22 november ke bich 4 karod 44 lakh kaa lone bant chukaa tha
 Only 6400 thousand farmers have got loan for Rabi cultivation
 kareeb teen lakh kisaanon ko paise nahin mili hai
 Not only farming, the rest of farmers' lives have also been affected
 ilaaj, shaadi, skool kii fees ke alaava ve pashuon ke liye chaara or khali bhi kharid kar laate hai
 They also have medicine, it is man's
 sabko intazaar he ki sarkaar kooparative bainkon ke bare main kuch faisla karegi or raahat degi
 a bank manager said that the government should do something for manure
 inkaa suzav he ki nayaa khaataa kholane par roak lagaai ja sakati he
 The amount to be deposited and withdrawn in the old account can be fixed
 sarkaar ne somvaar ko faisla sunaaya ki kisaan centre or rajya sarkaar ke beej kendron, krishi vishwavadyalayon se beej kharidne ke liye puraane noton kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 Even this relief has not relieved the farmers, because this decision of the government has not reached all the seed sales centers like the decision of marriage
 khaad ke bare main bhi chhot kaa intazaar ho rahaa he
 Our colleague Dhananjay discovered the condition of a purchase and sale center from Akot Tehsil in Akola district, Maharashtra
 kharid bikri centre ke shaaligram kaale ne kaha ki sarkaar ke faisle kii soochna un tak likhit nahin pahunchi he, isliye ve puraane noton ke badale beej nahin de rahe hai
 Shaligram ji brought sixty quintal seeds of wheat in October, but till November 22, only 10 quintals of seeds have been sold
 inaki dukaan par 8 november ke baad se 10,000 kaa hi bijness hua he jabaki ab tak 50 se 60 hazaar kaa bijness ho jaataa tha
 a sack contains 40 kg of wheat seeds
 keemat hoti he 1400 rupee
 50 kg of DAP fertilizer is also applied along with the seed, which costs Rs 1160
 maharashtra beej nigam ne to aktubar ke maheene main hi apane dealron ko beej kii supplai kar di thi lekin dealer 8 november ke baad nahin bech paa rahe hai
 There are 4500 to 5000 authorized dealers in Maharashtra
 22 taarikh ko kuch bijness hua wo bhi nae note se
 Our colleague Manish Kumar went to a fertilizer shop in Purnia and Farbisganj in Bihar
 privet dukandaar puraane noton ke badale khaad nahin bech saktaa he, sirf sarkari dukaan hi le sakate hai
 That too for seed
 ham rajasthan ke kisaanon kaa bhi haal janenge lekin pehle bataate hai agra kii aalu mandi kaa haal
 There are three types of potato
 ek bahut chote aakaar kaa aalu hota he jise baby pateto or kirch kehete hai
 a little bigger than that is called Gulla Aloo
 in donon kaa istamaal beej ke rup main hota he or isi november maheene main aalu kii buvaai hoti he
 Potato farmer traders say that the price of this variety of potatoes has completely crashed
 vyapaariyon ne bataaya ki do maheene pehle yahaan 50 kilo aalu kii bori 800 rupee main bik rahi thi
 700 to 750 rupees was the price of the sack till 7 no
 8 november kii notebandi ke baad ek hafte tak aalu mandi ko paala maar gaya
 After that, the rate is not stable
 quality ke hisaab se bada aalu 350 se 500 rupee bori ke bich bik rahaa he
 Every day, 500 trucks used to go from Agra Mandi towards South India and Maharashtra, but now their number is hardly 100-150
 bahut jagahon se order cancel ho rahe hai
 a farmer told that after loading 480 bags of potatoes, he sent them to Kanpur, but the potatoes sold so little in Kanpur that the merchant paid only 9032 rupees
 agar wo notebandi se pehle ke rate se detaa to kisaan ko dhai lakh rupee milte
 Out of this he paid 50,000 rent of the store
 magar ab use bhayankar ghate kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 That is, potato farmers have suffered a loss of one and a half to two lakhs on a truck
 har kisaan kaa anubhav alag he magar kisaanon kii pareshaani bhi alag-alag he
 In many mandis, farmers have to sell vegetables at low prices

 Prices of many vegetables have fallen
 ummid he upabhoktaaon tak iskaa laabh pahunch rahaa hoga lekin kisaan kaa kharchaa nahin nikalegaa to wo is achche monsoon kaa laabh nahin uthaa sakegaa
 This time the monsoon has been good and the farmers were hoping for a profit
 saurav ko ek kisaan ne bataaya ki wo 250 kimi dur fatehabad se aayaa tha
 Is a producer of brinjal
 notebandi se pehle wo 40 kilo kii apni bori 500 se 600 rupee main bechata tha, lekin 22 november ko wo 100 se 150 rupee main bech kar gaya wo bhi udhaar
 That is, this farmer lost about four hundred on a sack
 kisaan kaa kahana tha ki aane jane kaa haada bhi nahin niklaa he
 The price of green vegetables has been affected
 tamaato kaa ek kisaan yahaan shimla aayaa tha, wo aadhati se puraane note hi lekar chalaa gaya ki vahaan se itani dur aana sambhav nahin he
 He said how to harvest or change the note
 tippaniyan How will the farmers be compensated for the loss
 isliye unka sankat sirf beej kaa sankat nahin he
 If we could calculate these losses of farmers in some way, then it would have been known that this number would have been several thousand crores or lakh crores
 kisaanon ko sarkaar se ummid he
 In rural areas, there is a problem of cash in banks, but also in cities, the money in banks is running out quickly
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki agar ek kisaan ko pachaas hazaar se lakh do lakh kaa nuksaan hua to usase wo kitne dinon main ubar paaegaa
 What will be the burden on the debt
 himanshu shekhar bataa rahe hai ki aate ke daam ke baad daalon kii keemat bhi bad gai he
 Chana pulses have become expensive by Rs 38 in Rewa and Rs 37 in Shillong and 25 rupees per kg in Bathinda
 guuruuvaar se big bazaar ke outlet se 2000 tak aap nikaal sakate hai
 The stress of not getting money due to demonetisation is turning into depression and the news is coming out from some places to suicide
 upar se bainkon main badintazami alag pareshaan kar rahi he
 Various accidents are also happening in the queues of banks
 haryana ke ambala main ek buzurg mahila iskaa shikaar hui
 She came to the State Bank of Patiala branch to get new notes for her niece and nephew's weddings
 paise nikalwane ke form bank ke baahar janarator ke paas rakhe hue the
 When she went to lift the form, her shawl got stuck in the fan of the generator, died of strangulation
 shaadi ke ghar main matam pasar gaya he
 The son said that the mother had gone to withdraw the money a day earlier but the bank asked for her mobile number
 unhen number yaad nahin tha to ghar laut ain, agle din gayi to maut ne jakad liya
 The police have registered a case against bank personnel for their negligence in this case
 udhar aligarh or rajkot se bhi do aisi khabaren ain jo kisi ko bhi sihraane ke liye kaafii hai
 In Aligarh, a mother tried to commit suicide by being troubled by demonetisation, while in Rajkot a father gave his life due to financial problems in the daughter's marriage
 pehali shart ye thi ki 30 disambar tak shaadi vaale ghar ke log paisa nikaal sakate hai, lekin utana hi paisa nikaal sakate hai jitna unke khate main 8 november tak jamaa hoga
 Not only this, the parents of the bride or groom or the bride and groom themselves will go to the bank to withdraw money
 duulhaa-dulhan ke parivaar alag-alag dhai lakh hi nikaal sakenge
 Anyone who has made this guideline feels that he has not been in a wedding for a long time, nor has he been married to anyone
 par aisa to ho hi nahin saktaa he
 The problem of married families is not just to replace old notes
 jo jamaa he use nikaalnaa bhi he
 Marriage should be done with simplicity but whether it will be decided by the people or by demonetisation
 agar notebandi kaa yah bhi makasad he to ise agle lagan main bhi lagu kar dena chahie
 Until this happens, no one has the right to get their money, whether they spend it or not
 yahi nahin shaadi byaah kii apni ek arthvyavastha hoti he
 This helps many types of employment
 wo sab thapp se pad gaye
 If the bride-groom stays in the bank's line for hours or their parents stay with the Reserve Bank's guidelines, then who will look after the rest of the preparatory work
 bahut se log shaadi ke liye udhaar lete hai, ghar bechate hai
 How will all this money be deposited in the bank
 agar koi electronic tareeke se america se dilli ke khate main jamaa bhi kar de to bhi wo paisa nahin nikaala ja sakegaa
 The government is deciding how much money you will withdraw from your account, because 86 percent of the notes have not been displaced by the new notes
 sharton kii gaadi yahi nahin rukii
 Own 2 5 lakh nikaalane ke liye catarrs, tent vaale yaa marij home ko jo advance diya hoga uski raseed bhi deni hogi
 The one who is married in the house will have to give an affidavit that cash amount has been given to those who do not have a bank account
 jaise aap mandap sajaane ke liye phuulavaale ko tabhi is dhai lakh main se de sakenge, jab uske paas koi bank khaataa nahin hoga
 This means that if the florist has a bank account, he will have to give it by check
 yahi nahin bank ko saare dastavej sambhaal kar rakhane honge
 The Reserve Bank of India has issued another circular on 22 November
 21 november kaa circular hi maanya he, bas isamen ek baat yah jodi gai he ki jis insaan ko das hazaar yaa usase zyada nagad dene hai, unheen kaa hi naam bank main jamaa karaane hai
 The work of bankers has also increased a lot
 is bahaane har manager hamaare samaaj kii jo sachai dekh rahaa hoga, wo adbhut hoga
 i hope a manager will pen these experiences
 samajashastri ko gum-gum kar shaadiyon kii ricarding kerani chahie ki is vakt bharat main lakhon shaadiyon kaise ho rahi hai
 There are 25 to 30 thousand weddings a day in Delhi
 ab aate hai kisaanon kii samasya par
 The Finance Minister has also said that our next thrust will be on rural areas, then we also focus on farmers
 november se 15 disambar kaa maheene rabi kii fasal kii buvaai kaa hota he
 Wheat is the main crop in Rabi
 lekin ilaake ke hisaab se log rabi ke sizan main jau, chanaa, aalu or masoor bhi bote hai
 During this time, not only seeds, but also manure is needed
 iske liye kisaan dhan bechakar purana karj chukaate hai or nayaa karj lete hai
 Due to demonetisation, farmers cannot buy seeds, fertilizers and medicines from the cooperative bank nor can take loans
 zila kooparative bank or primary agricultural credit sosayadi ke note badalane, jamaa karne or nikaalane par roak he
 If they do not have new notes, where will they pay money on withdrawal? urban kooparative bank bhi noton kii kami kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Cooperative banks not only work for banks, but also for medicine, fertilizer and seed shops
 kooparative bank kisaanon kii life line hai
 The Mumbai District Cooperative Bank has filed a petition in the High Court that the Reserve Bank has arbitrarily excluded district cooperative banks from the process
 buvaai kaa vakt 15 disambar tak he isliye sarkaar or kisaan ke paas abhi bhi ek-do haftaa he kuch karne ke liye
 If there is a lot of delay, the yield of wheat will increase, but the quality will deteriorate
 rigerv bank ne kaha he ki zila kooparative bank or piesies kisaanon ko bataaen ki ve apane khate se har hafte 24,000 rupee nikaal sakate hai, lekin in bainkon kii shikaayat he ki unhen note nahin mil rahe hai
 We spoke to some people of the Ghaziabad District Cooperative Bank to find out what the impact has been on the farmers due to lack of new notes or non-exchange of permission
 is bank ke do-teen zilon main 33 branch hai or saadhe teen lakh kisaan iske sadsy hai ghaziabad ko 4 karod rupee hi alag-alag bainkon se mili hai
 The new note is not getting enough
 29 branchon kaa aankada bataata he ki abhi tak 1 karod 34 lakh kaa hi lone banta he, jabaki pichley saal 8 se 22 november ke bich 4 karod 44 lakh kaa lone bant chukaa tha
 Only 6400 thousand farmers have got loan for Rabi cultivation
 kareeb teen lakh kisaanon ko paise nahin mili hai
 Not only farming, the rest of farmers' lives have also been affected
 ilaaj, shaadi, skool kii fees ke alaava ve pashuon ke liye chaara or khali bhi kharid kar laate hai
 They also have medicine, it is man's
 sabko intazaar he ki sarkaar kooparative bainkon ke bare main kuch faisla karegi or raahat degi
 a bank manager said that the government should do something for manure
 inkaa suzav he ki nayaa khaataa kholane par roak lagaai ja sakati he
 The amount to be deposited and withdrawn in the old account can be fixed
 sarkaar ne somvaar ko faisla sunaaya ki kisaan centre or rajya sarkaar ke beej kendron, krishi vishwavadyalayon se beej kharidne ke liye puraane noton kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 Even this relief has not relieved the farmers, because this decision of the government has not reached all the seed sales centers like the decision of marriage
 khaad ke bare main bhi chhot kaa intazaar ho rahaa he
 Our colleague Dhananjay discovered the condition of a purchase and sale center from Akot Tehsil in Akola district, Maharashtra
 kharid bikri centre ke shaaligram kaale ne kaha ki sarkaar ke faisle kii soochna un tak likhit nahin pahunchi he, isliye ve puraane noton ke badale beej nahin de rahe hai
 Shaligram ji brought sixty quintal seeds of wheat in October, but till November 22, only 10 quintals of seeds have been sold
 inaki dukaan par 8 november ke baad se 10,000 kaa hi bijness hua he jabaki ab tak 50 se 60 hazaar kaa bijness ho jaataa tha
 a sack contains 40 kg of wheat seeds
 keemat hoti he 1400 rupee
 50 kg of DAP fertilizer is also applied along with the seed, which costs Rs 1160
 maharashtra beej nigam ne to aktubar ke maheene main hi apane dealron ko beej kii supplai kar di thi lekin dealer 8 november ke baad nahin bech paa rahe hai
 There are 4500 to 5000 authorized dealers in Maharashtra
 22 taarikh ko kuch bijness hua wo bhi nae note se
 Our colleague Manish Kumar went to a fertilizer shop in Purnia and Farbisganj in Bihar
 privet dukandaar puraane noton ke badale khaad nahin bech saktaa he, sirf sarkari dukaan hi le sakate hai
 That too for seed
 ham rajasthan ke kisaanon kaa bhi haal janenge lekin pehle bataate hai agra kii aalu mandi kaa haal
 There are three types of potato
 ek bahut chote aakaar kaa aalu hota he jise baby pateto or kirch kehete hai
 a little bigger than that is called Gulla Aloo
 in donon kaa istamaal beej ke rup main hota he or isi november maheene main aalu kii buvaai hoti he
 Potato farmer traders say that the price of this variety of potatoes has completely crashed
 vyapaariyon ne bataaya ki do maheene pehle yahaan 50 kilo aalu kii bori 800 rupee main bik rahi thi
 700 to 750 rupees was the price of the sack till 7 no
 8 november kii notebandi ke baad ek hafte tak aalu mandi ko paala maar gaya
 After that, the rate is not stable
 quality ke hisaab se bada aalu 350 se 500 rupee bori ke bich bik rahaa he
 Every day, 500 trucks used to go from Agra Mandi towards South India and Maharashtra, but now their number is hardly 100-150
 bahut jagahon se order cancel ho rahe hai
 a farmer told that after loading 480 bags of potatoes, he sent them to Kanpur, but the potatoes sold so little in Kanpur that the merchant paid only 9032 rupees
 agar wo notebandi se pehle ke rate se detaa to kisaan ko dhai lakh rupee milte
 Out of this he paid 50,000 rent of the store
 magar ab use bhayankar ghate kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 That is, potato farmers have suffered a loss of one and a half to two lakhs on a truck
 har kisaan kaa anubhav alag he magar kisaanon kii pareshaani bhi alag-alag he
 In many mandis, farmers have to sell vegetables at low prices

 What will be the burden on the debt
 himanshu shekhar bataa rahe hai ki aate ke daam ke baad daalon kii keemat bhi bad gai he
 Chana pulses have become expensive by Rs 38 in Rewa and Rs 37 in Shillong and 25 rupees per kg in Bathinda
 guuruuvaar se big bazaar ke outlet se 2000 tak aap nikaal sakate hai
 The stress of not getting money due to demonetisation is turning into depression and the news is coming out from some places to suicide
