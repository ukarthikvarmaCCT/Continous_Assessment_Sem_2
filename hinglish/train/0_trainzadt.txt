 It was expected that the government will take some policy initiatives in this general budget but the market is in shock due to the provisions made for investors
 desh kii badi aabaadi main achal sampatti main nivesh ko variyata, nivesh yogya adhishesh kii kami jaise karkon kii vajah se equity market main bhagidaari nichle str par bani hui he
 Apart from this, market fluctuations, lack of financial awareness and lack of government incentives are also major factors
 raahat kii baat yah he ki anya asset class main kamjor ritern or notebandi ke kaaran baari maatra main ghar main rakhi nakadi share bazaar main nivesh kii gai
 The shared efforts of market regulators, industry associations, media, fund houses such as partners and broking firms have helped to enrich the equity culture in the country
 haalanki ghar kii kul bachat kaa equity market main nivesh ab bhi paanch fisad par tikaa hua he jo anya ubharate bazaaron kii 10 se 15 fisad ke daayre kii tulana main bahut kam he
 There is obviously huge scope for the development of equity culture here

 Due to this, heavy selling is going on in the stock market
 bajet ke din se ab tak videshi niveshak kareeb 10,000 karod rupye kii nikasi kar chuke hai jabaki is shulk vruddhi se sarkaar ko koi bada laabh nahin hoga
 In contrast, six lakh crore rupees have been drowned by the hard work of investors in the equity market

 With this initiative, the broker path can be saved from bloodshed
 is maamle main vitt mantri spashtikaran dena chahie tha lekin is disha main koi thos pahal nahin kii gai
 In the current economic scenario, the government needs to take incentive packages or some immediate policy measures to increase demand and consumption which will generate employment, increase per capita income and increase investable savings with the people
 nivesh yogya oonchi bachat or lambii avadhi ke liye majboot puunji pravaah share bazaar kii dakshata badhaata he, asthirataa ko ghataata he or niveshkon ke vis main vruddhi karata he
 In such a situation, the government should bring flexibility in the law and give special incentives for tax cuts and exemptions so that long-term equity investment can be encouraged
 sarkaar kaa chaalu vitt varsh main saarvajanik upakramon main vinievesh se 1
 The target is to raise 05 lakh crores

 Like the ELSS in the budget, the proposal of tax benefit for CPSE etfs may increase equity culture but this initiative will not yield much benefit due to the multiple investment options in 80C
 raahat kii baat yah he ki khudara niveshkon kii gadhi kamai ab equity bazaar main aane lagi he
 This has never been seen before and this is likely to enrich equity culture more in the coming years
 sarkaar kaa daayitv he ki vah khudara niveshkon ke vis ko banaae rakhe
 The Finance Ministry's prolonged silence on the current state of the economy is exacerbating the crisis in the capital markets

 Chief Justice of India v
 en
 a file was found in front of Khare, which warranted the arrest of the President of the country, including his own, another judge of the Supreme Court and the head of the Bar Association
 kuch ghante pehle hi mujhe chaunkaane vaali baat bataai gai thi
 It was the summer of 2004, when a journalist named Vijay Shekhar of Zee News showed what a person could do, in his criminal case, from a judge of a lower court in Ahmedabad against some very strong, highly influential pillars of government Order was taken for action
 us saal transperency international ke karpshan index main bharat ko 146 deshon main 90wein sthaan par rakhaa gaya; africa ke malawi ke baraabar, dakshin america ke colombia se bhi neeche
 India made some progress to reach number 87 last time
 nyaayik pranali main bhrashtachar ko 5 main se 3
 Received 1 point (5 was for the most corrupt system)
 us grad ke pariprekshya main rajnatik partiyon ko 5 main se 4
 2, media 3
 0 or sena ko 2
 Got 8 points
 ham yah bhul jate hai ki nyaayik pranali main bhrashtachar kaa sarokaar keval nyaayadhishon se nahin he
 In fact, Transparency conducted a nationwide survey in 2007 that found 61 per cent of bribes were paid to lawyers, only 29 per cent to court officials and 5 per cent to middlemen
 lekin nyaayadhishon ko eemaandaaree ke sabase oonche maanakon par taula jaataa he
 Demand for rallies of protesters to pass the Lokpal Bill, and in some of them even to bring the judiciary under the Lokpal's purview, has arisen because of public allegations of theft over the years
 inamen se kuch maamleh nyaayadhishon ne gajiabad kii jila adaalat ke karmchaariyon kii bhavishya nidhi uda lee, ek or nyaayadhish ne karnataka main daliton kii jameen hadap lee, or bharat ke do purv mukhya nyaayadhishon ke rishtedaar itane amir hai ki unke paise kaa hisaab-kitaab kiya jaae to saarvajanik pad ke durupyog kii baat saamne aa sakati he
 In the balance that every country must try between the accountability and independence of the judiciary, our system is more inclined towards independence
 kisi hycourt yaa supreme court kaa koi nyaayadhish yadi rishwat letaa he to usase nibatane ke philhal teen tareeke hai
 First, a report can be filed against such a judge only after the approval of the Chief Justice of India
 doosraa, aksar diya jane vaala dand nyaayadhish kaa tabadalaa karnaa he
 The punishment for this is unclear - a few months ago the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association went on strike protesting that Gujarat had become a 'dumping ground' for the corrupt judges of the High Court
 teesraa, or hycourt yaa supreme court ke kisi nyaayadhish ko pad se hataane kaa iklauta tarika sansad main mahabhiyog ke jariye he
 In independent India, not a single judge has been removed by impeachment, because about two-thirds of the parliament's vote against him is necessary
 trishanku sansad kaa ruzan hone se yah kaam or bhi mushkil ho jayega
 At present, impeachment proceedings are to be held against Justice Paul Daniel Dinakaran and Justice Soumitra Sen
 unamem se kisi kaa bhi maamla pehle aa saktaa he
 The way the current Chief Justice of the country is cracking a whip on financial corruption, many cases are being investigated, prosecutions and impeachment process are going on
 masalan, unhone vartmaan nyaayamurti nirmal yadav ke khilaaf mukademe kii ijaajat di; unhen dene ke liye bheja gaya rupayon kaa thilaa galati se kisi duusare ke ghar pahunch gaya tha
 The present Chief Justice of the country to approve the case against Justice Yadav, former Chief Justice K
 ji
 The decision not to prosecute Balakrishna had to be changed
 ab khud nyaayamurti baalkrishnan par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 No satisfactory system depends so much on the conscience of a particular person
 nyaayadhishon ko anushaasit karne kii khatir nai pranali banane ke liye do vidheyak hai-civil sosayadi kaa pesh kiya gaya jan lokapal vidheyak, 2011 or nyaayik maanak evam uttardaayitv vidheyak, 2010
 The Jan Lokpal Bill of Civil Society has been sidelined by a UPA Government Bill in which judges are not held accountable for corruption
 vaise, civil sosayadi jis tarah kii maang kar rahi he, usamen circular yani ek-duusare ke saamne javabdehi tay kii gai haih lokapal supreme court ke kisi nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mukademe kii ijaajat de saktaa he, or supreme court bhrashtachar ke maamle main lokapal ke kisi sadsy yaa adhyaksh ko hataa saktaa he
 Appeals against the orders of the Lokpal will be heard first in the High Court and then in the Supreme Court
 isse adhikaron kii vidhvansaatmak ladaai chhid sakati he yaa badtar had tak yah ho saktaa he ki donon ke bich sahaj samajhaita ho jaae
 This version would require two separate authorities before whom judges would be accountable
 saat gaiyr-nyaayadhishon se bana lokapal vittiya bhrashtachar ke liye kisi nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii ijaajat degaa
 But if corrupt practices involve cases of other improper behavior - such as insider trading or exemption from advocating for a close relative in the same court - then the Lokpal will not have the authority to deal with it and the judge will be charged with another, non-action
 May have to face
 nyaayik uttardaayitv vidheyak bhi sansad main paarit hone ke liye padaa he
 It has a greater inclination towards independence and asks judges to declare their assets, set standards of practice and disciplinary arrangements
 koi bhi vyakti kisi nyaayadhish ke khilaaf neshnal jeudicial oversite cameti main shikaayat kar saktaa he, jisamen do gaiyr-nyaayik sadsy honge; isamen mahadhivaktaa-jaahir he, koi vakil-bhi hoga, jo un nyaayadhishon ke saamne pesh hoga jinka vah faisla karegaa, or raashtrapati kii ore se tainaat ek pramukh hasti bhi hogi
 But that complaint will be sent to an inquiry committee, in which the court judge against whom the complaint will be made, will have two sitting judges and a retired judge
 aise main pakshpaat hona swaabhaavik he
 But discipline is not enough to clean the system
 jis tarah se adaalaton kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he, usase ve bhrasht vyavhaar ke liye taiyaar rahati hai
 Unfortunately, most problems of the judicial system are solved by a single sequence of difficult reforms
 isamen shaamil hai:*nyaayadhishon kii sankhya badhanaa, adaalaton or buniyadi dhaanche main vruddhi karnaa or chhuttiyaan kam karnaa
 The slowness of the system creates a 'speed money' bribe to move forward in the queue
 isse vyavastha se bharosa bhi digne lagata he or kanoon todane kii samskruti ke liye upjau jameen taiyaar hoti jaati he; kyonki aksar kisi bhi tarah ke dand se bachane ke liye ek dashak se zyada samay mil jaataa he
 * Surveillance, regular property declaration and clear conflict of interest
 supreme court or kuch hycorton kii website par harek nyaayadhish kii sampatti kaa byora darj rahata he
 The judges declare their assets completely on their own
 nyaayik uttardaayitv vidheyak main is tarah kii ghoshnaa ko anivaary bana diya gaya he
 * To make court procedures transparent and predictable
 nyaayadhishon or vakeelon kii niyuktiyon, mukademe ke aavanton or andruni kharch main paardarshita laana
 Some courts have benefited from computerization — due to which some court procedures have become fixed rules for solving problems rather than human will, and this also makes it easier to monitor human decisions
 isliye supreme court registry main camere lagaana vaanchhneeya he
 Promote arbitration, defend arbitral decisions
 jab vaadi or prativaadee aamane-saamne baithe hon or samajhaita akelaa samaadhaan ho, to usamen bhrashtachar kii koi gunjaaish nahin rahati
 Burdened by the law, our court processes cover the real issue of litigation in terms of applications, legal provisions, strategy and retaliation
 supreme court kii ore se niyukt madhyasth ke rup main maine aise maamle dekhe hai jin par ek dashak se ladaai chal rahi thi, lekin kuch baithkon ke baad hi madhyasthata ke chalate samajhaita ho gaya
 For example, it was clear at the second meeting during the arbitration of a property case that the case was brought to court simply because the defendant had misbehaved with the plaintiff — with an apology in that agreement reached through arbitration Work is done madhyasthataayen adaalat kii antaheen chunautiyon se mukt hoti hai or unase vanidgiyak kshamta or nischitata main ijapha hota he
 Therefore, the possibilities of bribery from them will also be reduced
 *niyamon ko aasaan bananaa, nyaay ko sulabh bananaa
 In Chile and Uganda, court-related corruption decreased as procedural rules were relaxed
 bhartiya divaani prakriya samhita is kadar pechida he ki supreme court ke vakil bhi kisi nichali adaalat main kisi maamuli mul mukademe kii jirah karne se bachate hue najar aaenge
 The knowledge of these complex procedures gives lawyers and court officials a chance to recover money, but making the process easier will reduce these irregularities
 vyavastha main bhrashtachar kii har ghatana ke peeche kai tarah ke kaarak or kai tarah ke karta hote hai
 The hour of crisis is the perfect opportunity to implement long-pending reforms
 ab ek mauka he jab logon kii urja ko anushaasanamak tantra par bahes ke alaava adhik nyaayadhish niyukt karne or nyaayalay kaksh banane, madhyasthata ko protsaahit karne or niyamon ke sarleekaran kii ore modaa ja saktaa he
 In the case of purchased warrants, it was found that the judge was innocent, but was probably overworked and negligent, and the court's corrupt officials and lawyers issued warrants
 kisi ke khilaaf mukadmaa nahin chalaa or vijay shekhar ko unase pehle ke duusare kai patrakaron or lekhakon kii tarah adaalat kii chhavi bigaadane ke liye maafee maangane ko kaha gaya
 But it is a method that systematically picks out corrupt judges, court officials and lawyers
 nyaayik prakriya main logon kaa yakeen banaae rakhane ke liye yah jaruri he
 Such a method will also dispel rumors of corruption that are like a deadly mist surrounding an innocent judge
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad se hi apane talkh tevar dikhaane vaale siem kamalnath kaa ek alag rup saamne aayaa he
 The teacher of Jabalpur, who spoke Kamal Nath as a robber, has been forgiven by the CM
 siem kamalnath ne shanivaar ko bayaan jari kar kaha ki wo shikshak ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin chaahate or isliye unhen maaf kar diya jaae
 Let me tell you that recently a video of government teacher Mukesh Tiwari living in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh went viral
 is video main wo siem kamalnath ko daaku kah rahe the
 The teacher was suspended by the Jabalpur collector after the video went viral, but CM Kamal Nath has instructed the district administration to withdraw the teacher's suspension without any delay
 kamalnath kaa bayaansiemakamalanathane bayaan jari kar bataaya, 'mujhe abhi gyaat hua he ki jabalpur main ek shaskeey vidhyalay main padasth ek praadhyaapak dwaara ek baithak main meraa naam lekar daaku shabd kahe jane kaa video saamne aayaa

 hamane police ko mandir main pravesh karne kii ichha rakhane vaali kisi bhi mahila ko har sambhav suraksha pradaan karne ke liye sthaayee aadesh jari kiye theasarvocch nyaayalay dwaara beeti 28 sitambar ko har aayu varg kii mahilaon ko mandir main pravesh kii anumati dene kaa faisla kiye jane ke baad se sabarimala main hindu samoohon dwaara lagaataar is faisle ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan kiya ja rahaa he
 He says that this decision is against religious tradition
 28 sitambar, 2018 ko supreme court ne aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue kerala ke sabarimala mandir main sabhi umr kii mahilaon ko pravesh kii anumati de di
 The Supreme Court clearly stated in its decision that women of all age groups will now be able to enter the temple
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki hamaari samskruti main mahila kaa sthaan aadarneey he
 Here women are worshiped as goddesses and are prevented from entering the temple
 yah sweekaarya nahin he
 When the whole of India is living in anger, people are giving each other two hands due to corruption, inflation and disorder, then nothing else seems to be good at that time
 aise hi maahaul main congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rajasthan main ek ajeeb sa bhaashan diya
 He got emotional once again
 apane pita or daadi ko yaad karke
 He introduced his martyrdom in a strange way and meanwhile also threatened his life
 unki jaan ko to khatra he hi, tabhi to unhen jed plus shrenee kii sulaksha mili hui he or special protection group ke log unki suraksha kaa kaam dekhte hai
 But who is this danger and were there people of the same type in the murder of his grandmother and father? If not, they should clarify which people they may be
 sirf sampradayik tanaav kii baat karke ve kisi par nishaanaa nahin saadh sakate
 Threatening one's life is a big deal and telling it in a public place is either a serious matter or sheer ridicule
 agar rahul gandhi kii salaahkaar toli yah sochati he ki is tarah ke bayaan dilwakar ve unhen sahanubhuti dilava denge to yah unki galatfahami he
 Rahul Gandhi has always been aggressive (or is made aggressive) in his statements against Hinduist organizations but his government has not been able to prove anything against him even after all the efforts till date
 yani agar bijepi desh main dhruvikaran karnaa chaahati he to ve is tarah ke bayaan dekar aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Actually, Rahul Gandhi could not understand how to create an image in public
 unke salaahkaar yah chaahate bhi nahin hai ki unki koi chhavi bane
 If it is not, then when the criminal MP, he would have done the work of promoting the sympathy and popularity he had by publicly criticizing the bill protecting the MLA
 yah ek acha vikalp hota
 The public wants to see an aggressive Rahul Gandhi who is fighting his own system and not Rahul who mourns death
 vah samasyaon se ghiri hui he or use isse ubaarane vaala aakraamak hero chahie na ki bhay main jeeta ek kamjor sa dikhne vaala netaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will talk to real chowkidars across the country on 20 March
 shaam saadhe chaar baje yah baatcheet hogi
 It is being claimed that 25 lakh Chowkidars will be addressed
 31 march ko un chaukidaaron se bhi baat karenge jo twitor par bane hai
 This means that the BJP is serious about the watchman campaign
 to hamane sochaa ki un 25 lakh chaukidaaron main se jharkhand main 10,000 chaukidaaron kaa haal pehle hi bataa den, jinhen kai maheenon se selary nahin mili he
 In some districts, salary has not been received since November, while in some districts salary has not been received after January
 har tyohaar se pehle inaki yahi khabar hoti he ki diwali se pehle vetan nahin mila to feeki rahegi diwali or holi se pehle vetan nahin mila to feeki rahegi holi
 Look at the news published on the Chowkidars in the local newspapers of Jharkhand
 chaukeedaar thane ke gulam banakar rah gaye hai
 Appointment should be done in the villages, but they are kept for private work at the house of senior officials
 bartan manjavate hai
 The leaves are selected
 inke pradarshan kii puraani khabaron kii cliping bataati he ki samay par vetan milanaa inaki mukhya maang rahi he
 Some Chowkidars have gathered outside Ratu Police Station, 40 km from Ranchi
 inkaa vetan 20,000 he
 But never get on time
 inkaa sawaal yah he ki jab nakli chaukidaaron yani mukhyamantri or vidhayakon ko selary pehali taarikh ko aa jaati he to inaki selary aane main maheenon kaa vakt kyon lagata he
 The Chowkidar Act was enacted in 1870
 30 disanhabar 1989 ko bihar cabinet ne chaukidaaron ko chaturth shrenee kaa karmchaaree ghoshit kiya tha
 On 20 December 1995, the cabinet of Lalu Yadav's government brought a provision that the designated dependents of Chowkidars be given jobs
 magar kisi ko naukari nahin mili
 On 23 May 2014, the Government of Jharkhand issued an order that the places where dependents of Chowkidars are to be appointed should be postponed
 tab se ashriton kii koi niyukti nahin hui he
 Lalu Yadav may not even remember this thing now
 chaukidaaron ke har pradarshan main ye bhi ek maang hoti he ki ashriton kii niyukti ho
 Krishna Dayal Singh, President of Chowkidar Union of Jharkhand, said that a rule was made in 2015 as per the High Court order
 jiske anusaar har 100 se 120 gharon par ek chaukeedaar niyukt hona chahie
 But instead the watchmen who were working were removed
 krishna dayaal singh ke anusaar gramin ilaakon main ugravadi chaukidaaron kii hatya kar dete hai magar unhen koi muawza nahin miltaa he
 Chaukidars have not received salary in all the districts of Bihar for over a month
 kai zile main do teen maheene se selary nahin mili he
 Salary has not been received in Madhubani's Jayanagar for five months
 chhapra main bhi teen maheene se selary nahin mili he
 In Bihar, Chowkidars are considered to be in the Chatursh category and their salary starts from 20,000 to 30 thousand
 bihar main sabase adhik chaukeedaar patna main hai or madhubani main hai
 If the chowkidars of Bihar and Jharkhand get salary, then at least these people will also play Holi in the name of prime time
 kam se kam bihar or jharkhand kii sarkaar yahi pran kar len ki ab chunki pradhanmantri twitor par chaukeedaar ban gaye hai to kam se kam asli chaukidaaron kaa vetan vidhayakon se pehle milanaa chahie
 We are telling you that the janitor of the leaders
 
 
 chaukeedaar khilne main or asli jivan main chaukeedaar kaa jivan jeene main kitna fark he
 There is no harm in knowing how the life of the chowkidars in the village towns
 agar campan ke liye kaich line likhane waalon kaa yah abhiyaan safal hi hona he to isi bahaane in chaukidaaron ke jivan main bhi bahaar aa janaa chahie
 The houses that are responsible for the security of these guards, there is nothing in their own house that should be guarded
 daravaaza tak nahin he or chat bhi hawa ke saath upar neeche hoti rahati he
 Looking at this standard of life of watchmen, you can see the standard of life of watchmen with twitter
 espiji suraksha ghere main chalane vaale chaukeedaar kaash in gharon ke chaukidaaron kaa haal jaanate
 These houses belong to the chowkidars who work at the Kundarki police station in Moradabad
 hamaari koshish he ki inkaa jivan str behatar ho
 Like Bihar and Jharkhand, these watchmen also received more than 20,000 salaries
 1500 ke vetan par ye chaukeedaar kaise kaam karte honge
 Seeing the condition of their work outside the police station, they do not think that they can be guarded
 sharir kamazor dikhataa he
 Hear the agony of Aam Ram Kishore, Shivkumar, Bir Singh Chowkidar today
 ho sake to inkaa twitor acount banaakar, pradhanmantri ko tag kar den
 It would be so nice that the watchmen who are being exploited in our system get tagged with the Prime Minister on Twitter and say that we too are watchmen, listen to our watchman
 kai saal pehle hamane dilli mahanagar main kaam karne vaale security guard ke jivan par baqayda ek dacumentry banaai thi
 It is telling this so that you do not feel that when this campaign came, they remembered it
 balki inke jivan ko jaanata hum isliye laga ki campan ke bahaane bataaya jaae
 The security guards of the cities are not in very good condition
 kaam chal jaataa he
 Stand and work for 12 to 18 hours
 agar pradhanmantri ke 31 march ke kaarykram se pehle itnaa hi ho jaae ki sari security agency vachan le len, likh kar de den ki security guard ko puure maheene main ek din kii chuttee nahin milti he, ab se har security guard ko maheene main chaar chhuttiyaan milengi to is abhiyaan kaa kuch phayda bhi ho
 For three-four days, 'I am a watchman' campaign has been going on
 Did you see that the condition of real watchmen is being discussed in the media
 chaukeedaari aasaan kaam nahin he
 i want to tell the condition of a school in Ballia district of UP so that the Election Commission remembers that it is also necessary to be guarded in this election
 aap khud bataaen yah skool lagata he yaa bhaajapa kaa mukhyalay lagata he
 This government school in Dharhara village of Ballia is painted in such a way that it looks like a BJP office
 yah primary skool he
 Many times polling stations are built in such places in elections
 principal kii kya yah safai paryaapt he ki mazdoor se kaha gaya ki gulabi se rang do or vah galat rang lekar aa gaya
 Cannot return if the paint box is opened rangane ke baad pataa chalaa ki ye bijepi ke jhande se miltaa julata he
 Now you tell the audience
 bijepi ke jhande main do rang hai
 Did the worker bring both the wrong colors and this wrong color was similar to the BJP flag
 baliya ke log hi bataa sakate hai ki aisi galati sirf ek hi skool main hui he yaa kai skulon main hui he
 Karuna Sindhu spoke to principal Pushpa Yadav about why her school looks like a BJP flag
 gaanv ke log kehete hai ki isse bijepi kaa prachaar ho rahaa he
 When the children return from school, they say that our school has been colored in the BJP
 poochne par apper ziladhikari ne kaha ki skool ko dobaaraa se rangava diya jayega
 The question is why the administration did not do this work by itself as soon as the code of conduct came into force
 jab deevaaron par poster vagairah kii ginati shuru ho jaati he to yah skool kaise nazar se batch gaya
 What is the Election Commission doing? kya is chook ke liye adhikariyon se sawaal nahin poocha janaa chahie
 This information reached us through an audience who were passing by next to this school
 ummid he kal tak is skool kaa rang badal diya jayega
 When prime time started with the pay of Chowkidars, then let us tell the story of another section who are worried about salary from Jharkhand
 taaki aap in reporton ke bahaane dekh saken ki dilli ke baahar kaa hindustan kaisaa dikhataa he
 What is the condition of the system
 jharkhand ke 67 hazaar para shikshakon ko sitambar maheene se vetan nahin mila he
 Ravi Ranjan Sinha, Para teacher of Giridih, has written a letter to the Education Extension Officer
 unase chuttee maangi he taaki ve bheekh maang kar guzaaraa kar sake
 Ravi Ranjan Sinha has been teaching in a school for 17 years
 patr main likhaa he ki ab karjadaar bhi karj nahin dete hai
 In the illness, it becomes difficult to buy medicine
 67 hazaar karmchaariyon ko 6 maheene se vetan na mili, is par koi charchaa nahin
 The media has made those who watch the news newsless
 67 hazaar logon ko vetan nahin milanaa koi news vailu nahin he
 Even if this news is published, then such news has no human value
 khabaren chhapati hai or sarkaar ansuna kar detii he
 In place of these reports, a survey is being conducted in the media about what percentage of the popularity of which leader
 ek survey ke number ke peeche lakhon karodon logon kii takalif kaa number zero ho jaataa he
 All of them were last paid in September last year

 What did Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan's boyfriend and model Adam San talk to a non-woman for a long time, Lohan was severely irritated by Adam's actions and could not stop the woman from telling him the truth
 ‘min girl’ kii gayika lasengelis ke ek nitaclub main adam ke gai thi, jahaan adam ne ek anjaan mahila ke saath kuch der tak baat kar lee
 Apparently Lohan had to be jealous when she saw her boyfriend talking with a non-woman, so not only did she get entangled with the woman but Adam came out of the nightclub
 femelfirst ne khabar di he ki lohan pehali baar disambar 2009 main adam ke pyaar kii giraft main ai thi
 Dinesh Patidar (53 years) Chairman, Shakti Pumps, who was forced to sell vegetables due to weak economic condition while studying, is now the Chairman and Managing Director of Shakti Pumps, a leading Indian company
 garibi kii vajah se hi ve bi
 He could not even complete his com studies but today he owns a company that exports pumps to 100 countries
 indore ke industrial aria pithampur main is company kii neenv dinesh patidaar ke pita manohar laal patidaar ne 1982 main rakhi thi, jo kisaan the or kisaanon kii behatari ke liye kaam karnaa chaahate the
 This was the reason why he decided to start the pump business and opened a pump manufacturing factory
 1986 main isaki bagdor unke bete dinesh patidaar ne sambhaal lee
 When Dinesh took over the business, the company had a revenue of Rs 12 lakh
 tha
 In three decades, he made the business Rs 335 crore
 tak pahunchaa diya
 Dinesh says that many people have contributed to make him reach this point, but he particularly remembers the important role of Madhya Pradesh government
 ve bataate hai, ''1986 main mujhe madhya pradesh finance korporation se 9 lakh ru
 Helped
 is rakam se mujhe kaarobaar ko aage badhaane main kaaphi madad mili
 "to grow the business, Dinesh raised Rs 5 crore for his company through IPO in 1995
 kii puunji bazaar se uthaai
 That's when M
 es
 Due to brokers like Shoes and Harshad Mehta, the confidence of common people was lost on the market
 lekin dinesh ke ipio par logon ne bharosa dikhaaya
 The very next year, the company started selling its products abroad and first exported goods to Dubai
 aaj dubai, australia or uese main bhi company ke offis hai
 Dinesh clarifies, “we have been farmers ourselves
 kisaanon ke dard ko hamase zyada koun jaan saktaa tha
 We have also gone through this experience ourselves
 kisaan samay par apni fasal ko pani nahin de paata he to uski puri fasal suukh jaati he
 Therefore, it was always our endeavor to make such a pump for farmers, which could make water available in low power
 "company kii safalataa kaa ek paimaana yah bhi he ki 1987 main madhya pradesh main 20 laghu udyog the, jinamein se 18 aaj band ho chuke hai
 But Shakti Pumps is not only present but is also setting new dimensions of success
 dinesh kehete hai, "safalataa ke liye vijan, spashtataa or paagalpan kii had tak junun jaruri he
 "dinesh is always in search of a technology to make such pumps in which the use of electricity is minimal, as well as he is also looking to move towards the use of solar energy
 shakti pamps company ke vigyaapan main mashhoor abhinayta amitabh bachchan is pump ke phaayde bataate najar aate hai
 "amitabh Bachchan will advertise our product," says Dinesh
 i took this decision after meeting Nirma Company head Karsan Bhai Patel
 ''darasal, pithampur main jis jagah aaj shakti pamps company he vahiin kabhi nirama company kii factory hua karti thi
 Dinesh bought this land
 baatcheet ke dauraan jab dinesh ne karsan patel ko bataaya ki ve desh ke sabase behtareen panpon kaa utpaadan karte hai to patel ne unhen bataaya ki unhone to kabhi shakti pump kaa naam bhi nahin suna
 Here Karsan Bhai gave important advice to Dinesh
 unhone kaha, ''agar aap sabase acha utpaada banaate hai to yah jaruri he ki logon ko uske bare main bataane kaa tarika bhi best hona chahie
 "he had thought that he would make his product known to the public through Amitabh Bachchan, one of the most famous actors in the film industry
" dinesh ke mutabik, vigyaapan main bachchan ke hone se company kii brands vailu badi he
 The father of a son and a daughter, Dinesh, is considered by his family to be a strict, sometimes soft-tempered person
 subah thik 9 baje daftar main pahunchane vaale dinesh kaa daftar aane kaa samay to nishchit he lekin ghar lautne kaa nahin
 a few years ago, when he was working on the design of the pumps, he used to reach home at midnight and leave the office again in the morning
 apane daptar main unhone apane pita manohar laal patidaar kii tasviir laga rakhi he, jise dekhakar unamem nai urja bhar jaati he
 He says, "father has given inspiration to work
" unke maargdarshan ke bagaiyr main is mukaam tak nahin pahunch saktaa tha
 "dinesh's 27-year-old son Ankit is following the footsteps of his father, managing the company's marketing
 unki patni indira company kii korporate-soshal responsibility (siesaar) sambhalati hai
 She explains, "the company has adopted the school of Rangavasa under CSR
 ''rangavasa dinesh kaa paitruk gaanv he
 Apart from this, the company also pays engineering fees for many poor children
 company kaa shakti foundation ke naam se trust he, jiske tahat swasthya, pani or shiksha ke kshetra main kaam kiya jaataa he
 Shakti Pumps has also installed solar pumps to help farmers at many places
 aaj shakti pamps 260 se bhi zyada dizin ke panpon kaa utpaadan kar rahi he or unke upabhoktaaon main desh-videsh kii kai companiyaan shaamil hai
 With this, it is the first company in the country to start manufacturing 100% stainless steel pumps
 11 mulkon kii police ko don kaa intjaar he
 
 
 Everyone will remember this dialogue of Shahrukh in the film 'don'
 lekin ab sirf police hi nahin, balki media ko bhi shahrukh kaa intjaar he
 In fact, it is reported that on Friday, a press conference was held in Chennai for the promotion of Shah Rukh Khan's film Happy New Year, which was supposed to arrive at 4 pm
 lekin king khan raat 8 baje pahunche
 Angry media persons boycotted this press conference due to this long wait of four hours
 chennai ke ITC grand chola main sabhi mediakarmiyon ko is conference ke liye kareeb 4 baje pahunchane ke liye kaha gaya tha, jiske chalate media kareeb 4 ghante tak shahrukh kii raah dekhtaa rahaa
 As soon as Shahrukh arrived, the media decided to boycott the event, raising voice against it
 shahrukh ne harek mediakarmi ko apana exclusive intervyuu dene kaa vaada bhi kiya, lekin gussaye mediakarmiyon ne shahrukh kii ek nahin suni or sabhi press conference chhodkar chale gaye

 tippaniyan The Supreme Court bench hearing the case has asked the temple board and the government when the entry of women into Sabarimala was closed

 The Supreme Court gave 6 weeks time for a reply and appointed senior lawyers Raju Ramachandran and k Ramamurthy as assistants to the court
 haalanki mandir board ne kaha tha ki ye pratha ek hajaar saal se chal rahi he
 Now why is the Supreme Court taking up this matter? Not only Sabarimala but the entry of women is prohibited on the entire Sabarimala mountain

 The BJP said that on one hand its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is raising issues like development, economy, unemployment and dearness which concern the public, on the other hand Rahul and Congress's top leadership instead of answering them 'owl' and ' Bizarre nouns like 'toffee' have started to be given
 party ne kaha ki yah aisa hi jaise koi agyani adhyaaapak chaatro ke prashnon kaa uttar nahin aane par idhar-udhar kii baaten karne lage
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said, "if the voter votes to oust the Congress from power, it is not an 'owl'"
 paraajay saamne dekhakar kisi netaa ko shaleenta nahin chhod deni chahie
 Those who are not voting for the Congress will have some reasons
 cruddh matadaata un chaar aksharon kaa shabd nahin he, jiskaa istemaal rahul ne unke liye kiya he
 Party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said, "rahul's statement shows that he has reached bankruptcy of meaningful issues as well as intellectual bankruptcy of words
" unhone aarope lagaaya ki modi dwaara uthaae gaye vikaas or sushasan ke muddon ke aage niruttar ho jane ke baad congress netritv ne sampradayikta kaa vishay uthaane kaa bahut prayaas kiya, lekin usamen bhi use safalataa nahin mili
 He said that Congress leaders sometimes comment on the personal life of BJP leaders, and sometimes they start talking about it, which is a proof that they have completely disappeared
 elahabaad hoicourt ne buudhvaar ko upi ke mantri ajam khan ko notice jari kiya he
 At the same time, the court has stayed the suspension of five policemen suspended in the Muzaffarnagar riots cases
 mujffarnagar dangon ke maamle main upi sarkaar ne paanch thanaprabhariyon ko nilambit kar diya tha
 Policemen allege that the suspension was done at the behest of UP Minister Azam Khan
 in pulisavaalon ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki ajam khan ke dabaav ke baad un saat logon ko hiraasat se reeha kiya gaya tha jin par do jat or ek muslim ladke kii hatya kaa aarope laga tha
 It was being said that this was why there were riots in the area
 in dangon main 50 log maare gaye the or kareeb 45 hajaar log visthapit hue the
 The court said that the allegation of misconduct in the order of suspension does not seem appropriate, it only shows that these policemen could have dealt with the riots more effectively
 vahiin, court ne kaha ki jo aarope upi ke mantri par lag rahe hai, vah kaaphi gambhir hai or is puure prakaran par gaur kiya jaae to is aadesh ke peeche ke kaarnon par gaur kiya janaa chahie
 It is also necessary to see whether the law has been followed

 bhartiya janata party (BJP) main pichley 13 varshon se sanghathan mahaamantri pad par kaam karne vaale raamalaal kii vidaai charchaa main he
 The Sangh sent him to the BJP in 2006 and has now been called back and made All India Co-liaison Chief
 raajnneetik galiyare main raamalaal kaa kad ghatane kii charchaa he
 However, sources related to BJP and RSS politics do not believe so
 unka kahana he ki bijepi ke sanghathan mahaamantri pad se hatane par raamalaal kaa glamer bhale kam ho jaae or pehle kii tarah aam kaaryakartaaon or padaadhikariyon se sidhaa naata bhale nahin rahegaa, magar sangh main akhil bhartiya sah sampark pramukh kaa pad behad ahm he
 Their status will remain intact
 is pad par rahane vaala vyakti sangh ke andar nahin balki baahar rahakar anushangik sanghathanon kaa vistaar karata he
 His job is to contact important people and get his help for the RSS
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is pad kii ahmiyat sirf sangh kii karypranali ko samajhane vaale hi samaj sakate hai
 With Ramlal staying in the same post for more than 13 years, the change in his liability was believed to be fixed
 aakhir 11 se 13 july ko vijaywada main chali praant prachaarkon kii baithak main unhen bijepi ke sanghathan mahaamantri se hataakar sangh main nai jimmedaari dene kaa faisla hua
 On the removal of Ramlal from the post of Organization General Secretary, a RSS pracharak says, "do you want someone to remain in the same position in BJP for a lifetime
 ise hataanaa nahin, daayitv parivartan kehete hai
 This is a natural process
 "bijepi ke samparkon se sangh ke 36 sanghathanon kaa karenge vistarasang ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki haalia varshon main 'sangh parivaar' main shaamil sahyogi sanghathanon main sabase zyada vistaar isaki raajnneetik shakha bijepi kaa hua he
 It is clear that the Sangh as a strategy does not publicly consider BJP as its political wing
 sangh ke anya 36 anushangik sanghathan vistaar or majbootee ke maamle main bijepi ke mukaable kaaphi peeche chal rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Sangh is now trying to bring other 36 organizations parallel to BJP
 taaki sangh parivaar main santulan kaa sankat na khadaa ho
 The Sangh believes that a pracharak who has spent his entire life in the RSS cannot do this work as much as a pracharak with a big contact in the BJP
 kyonki sangh ke seva bharti, swadeshi jaagran manch sahit anya sabhi sanghathanon ke kaaryon ke liye jaruri sansaadhan or fund bhi chahie
 On this scale, only Ramlal fit in the eyes of the RSS
 aresas sutron nexjthak
 told that in the 13 years of being in the bjp's position, Ramlal has made good contacts with BJP central ministers, chief ministers, bureaucracy and prominent people from business fields
 aise main aresas unki 'utility vailu' ko jaanate hue uskaa phayda sangh ke sanghathanon ke vistaar main lenaa chahta he
 Giving an example, a source in the Sangh said that if a project of Seva Bharti requires funds and other resources, then Union Minister, Chief Minister or other influential people can be managed by Corporate Social Responsibility just by Ramlal's suggestion
 jabaki duusare prachaarkon ke kehane par itnaa fark nahin pad saktaa
 Sangh ideologue Dilip Deodhar of Nagpur says, 'I think the Sangh wants to make Ramlal the grandfather of today
 nanaaji ne chitrakoot aadi sthanon par sevakaryon se badi pahchaan banaai, ab sangh chahta he ki raamalaal bhi sangh ke anushangik sanghathanon ke jariye naanaa kii saamaajik kaaryon kii muhim ko or aage badhayen

 Mamlaramlal's departure from bjp's post of General Secretary is also linked to the departure of one faction KN Govindacharya and Sanjay Joshi, while RSS sources say Ramlal's case is completely different
 atal bihari vaajapeyi se matbhedon ke chalate keen govindacharya ko pad chhodana padaa tha
 He called Vajpayee a BJP mask
 jiske baad vaajapeyi ne sangh se saaf kah diya tha ki vah govindacharya ko bijepi me nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 Later, Advani also supported Vajpayee
 vahiin 2005 main kathith sex sidi saamne aane ke baad sanjay joshi ko bhi sanghathan mahasachiv kaa pad chhodana padaa tha
 After which both the veterans neither appeared in any role in the Sangh nor did they return to the BJP
 aaj tak bijepi or sangh se kinare hai
 While Ramlal has been given important responsibility in the Sangh even after being removed from the post of BJP General Secretary
 jaahir he ki raamalaal kii praasangikta sangh or bijepi main bani rahegi
 The job of the liaison chief is to connect the union and other organizations to outsiders
 kyon sah sampark hi bane raamalalramlaal akhil bhartiya sah pramukh kyon bane, sampark pramukh kyon nahin bane
 This is also a question
 aresas sutron kaa kahana he ki march main hone vaali pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main hi pramukh padon par niyuktiyaan ho jaati hai
 According to the constitution of the RSS, once an appointment is made, it is not removed in the middle, but a decision is taken in the upcoming meeting itself
 chunki is vakt akhil bhartiya sampark pramukh aniruddh deshpandey hai
 In such a situation, Ramlal was accommodated in the Sangh as a co-principal
 aresas sutron kaa kahana he ki agle saal march main hone vaali pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main ho saktaa he ki raamalaal ko akhil bhartiya sampark pramukh bana diya jaae
 There is no order in the Sangh, it is known that Rajju Bhaiya's Union ideologue of Kesnagpur Dilip Deodhar aajtak
 inse kehete hai ki sangh main pad nahin vyavastha hoti he
 He tells an interesting story related to this
 ve kehete hai ki tab balasahab devaras sangh ke pramukh the
 He had made Rajju Bhaiya his deputy, ie Sarkaryavah
 is bich 1987 main rajju bhaiya ne apana sar kaarywah kaa pad echvi sheshadri ko saunp diya or khud unke sahyogi yani sah- sar kaarywah ban gaye
 There was an uproar in the RSS on how Rajju Bhaiyya is sitting on his junior only
 is par tatkaaleen sangh pramukh devaras ne bhi rajju bhaiya se naaraazgi jaahir karte hue poocha tha ki aapako is niyukti kaa adhikaar kisne diya
 On this, Rajju Bhaiya had said that in the constitution of the Union, Sarkaryavah is the executive head, while the head of the union is the guide
 rajju bhaiya ne devaras se kaha tha- aap or ham donon biimaar chal rahe hai, aise main kisi urjavan prachaarak ko sangh main number do hona chahie
 Deoras agreed then
 rajju bhaiya ke is faisle se sandesh gaya ki sangh main koi pad chota, bada nahin hota, jimmedaari badi hoti he
 What we consider to be a position is a system
 agar ek saamaanya kaaryakarta ko badi jimmedaari mili he to vah ahm pad par baithe sangh padaadhikari se bhi mahatvapurn he

 Despite holding many meetings in one day, the Muslim is currently divided between the BSP and the Samajwadi Party

 The Shiv Sena, intent on performing against Shah Rukh, has threatened to disrupt the performance of his upcoming film My Name Is Khan
 yahi nahin cinemagharon main film ke poster bhi phaade ja rahe hai
 Opposing this, Sandeep Sawant, director of Marathi film Breath, which was India's entry for the Oscars, said, "it is utterly wrong to get this kind of rage on the film
" film akele shahrukh kii nahin, balki isse nirdeshak se lekar spot bvoize tak hajaaron log jude hai
 In such a situation, it is too much to take a dig at Shahrukh's statement
 ’’vahiin rashtriya puraskaar praapt geetkaar swanand kirakire ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki is masale kaa puri tarah se raajnneetikaran kiya ja rahaa he jabaki kala ko raajnneeti se dur rakhana jaruri he

 samvidhan ne harek ko apni raay jaahir karne kaa moulik adhikaar diya he jiskaa hanan ho rahaa he
 An atmosphere of panic has been created which is utterly wrong
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘marathiyon ke naam par is tarah kii raajnneeti ho rahi he jabaki unhen in masalon se koi sarokaar nahin he
 These political parties are doing poison work
 ’’kirakire ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata ki shahrukh ne koi bahut galat baat boli thi
 a mountain of mustard is being built
 vaise bhi meraa maananaa he ki isse bade masale desh ke saamne hai jin par gaur karnaa zyada jaruri he
 This is all meaningless
 ’’ saavant ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki ‘maai nem ij khan’ kii relies main baadha khadi karnaa bekaar kii jid he
 Political parties should blame the hard work behind making a film
 ’’karan johar nirdeshit yah mahatvakankshi film 12 farvari ko relies ho rahi he jisamen shahrukh nau baras baad kaajol ke saath najar aayenge
 Shah Rukh apologized to Karan, Kajol and all the people associated with the film, saying that the film was causing damage to them, but refused to apologize to the Shiv Sena

 com / khvd4dl7jg — Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) December 29, 2018 banjar khet, marate maveshi, nirjan gaanv
 After three years of drought, most of the land in Maharashtra is showing the same attitude
 lekin sookhe se buree tarah prabhavit rajya ke bid main is aapadaa main bhi shaatir logon ne apni jeben bharne ke raste dhund liye hai
 Not even leaving the cattle fodder
 india today kii jaanch se saamne aayaa he ki kaise kuch enjio maveshi rakhane vaale kisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye tay sarkari fund ko dakaar rahe hai
 An under-cover reporter from India Today found out how ngos earmarked for supplying cow fodder to livestock camps in the state are fudging their own and their political bosses in this task
 is saal march kii shuruyaat main maharashtra sarkaar ne aisi suvidhaayen shuru karne kaa elaan kiya tha, jahaan kisaan apane maweshiyon kii khuraaq ke liye sahaayta le saken
 According to officials, till June, around 1,635 fodder camps were set up to help 11 lakh cattle
 pashudhan sahaayta 9 se 18 kilogram prati maveshi ke hisaab se 50 rupee se 100 rupee ke bich tay he
 If one thousand cattle are handled in a facility center, then this amount sits at one lakh rupees per day
 india today kii jaanch se khulaasa hua ki in suvidha campon se jude kai santhaan bijepi or shivasena ke netaaon yaa unke vishwaasapatro kii ore se manage kiye jate hai
 Some such institutes are also run by pseudonyms
 hairaani kii baat he ki ye santhaan khud ko gaiyr munafa siddhant par chalane vaale bataate hai
 Ganesh Waghmare, a member of the Gram Panchayat and associated with the Shiv Sena, has the responsibility of running a fodder camp at Kalsambar in Beed district
 vaaghmare ne kabool kiya ki sookhaa raahat thikaane lagane ke liye kagajaat main herapheri or pashuon ko kam chaara diya jaataa he
 Waghmare told the under-cover reporter, "the amount is fixed for all officers
 main kisi bhi chitthee yaa record ko muhaiyaa kara saktaa hum
 i did not give them (cattle) supplements even for a day, not even a pinch
 bade maveshi ke liye 18 kilo or chote maveshi ke liye 9 kilo chaara nirdhaarit he lekin main 12 or 6 kilo hi detaa hum
 Waghmare records showed how the consumption of fodder is shown on paper
 vaaghmare ne kaha, 'maine aadhikarik register par sin karne ke liye log rakhe hue hai or dekhtaa hum ki har sin ke baad anguuthe kaa nishaan bhi ho
 99% of the farmers are illiterate
 'jaanch se saamne aayaa ki vaaghmare jaise sthaneey netaaon ne 10 se 15 camp bana rakhe hai or aadhikarik filon main graminon ke naam partner ke taur par dikhaa rakhe hai
 Almost the same method is adopted in every village
 aher vaadgaanv main mukung rohite ne kabool kiya ki uski ore se sanchalit campon main maweshiyon kii raahat ke fund ko thikaane lagane ke liye kitabon main niyamit taur par herpher kiya jaataa he
 Rohite said, "in the register that we maintain, the figures are exaggerated
 ham videography bhi karte hai
 We have to show that every family has four to five members and every member has five cattle, then 20 cattle sit according to the whole family
 ” rohite ne checking ke liye aane vaale inspectoron ko ghoose dene kii baat bhi maani
 Rohite also claimed that a minister in the Maharashtra government is also using such a facility for his own benefit
 india today ke paas rohite kaa puraa kaboolnamaa maujuud he
 In which he has revealed the identity of the minister in the tape
 agar aadhikarik taur par rohite ke daawey kii jaanch kaa faisla liya jaae to ye tepe saajha kiye ja sakate hai
 Gorakh Shingan, who runs a fodder camp in Kolavadi, another village in Beed, also confessed to adopting similar methods to tamper with the records
 shingh ne kaha, ‘hamaare paas sabhi graminon ke puure record hai or ham jarurat padane par 2,000 maweshiyon ko aasaani se dikhaa sakate hai
 There will be no trouble even if inspection happens
 ’ shingh ne shivesna ke ek sthaneey netaa kaa bhi hawala diya jisane pichley maheene chaare ke ek camp par gadabadi ke shaq main pade chaape kaa virodh kiya tha
 Maharashtra Cooperation, Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Subhash Deshmukh, while referring to this inquiry, said, 'all the fodder camps have been allotted according to the set standards and all are doing well
 ham pehle ke chaara campon main gadabadi kii shikayaton par pehle se hi karrwai kar rahe hai
 There may be some Ikadukka cases of not following Xiao tagging
 agar gadabadi kii koi nai shikaayat saamne aati hai to ham karrwai karenge
 When the Minister of State for Agriculture Sadabau Khot was contacted in this regard, he said, "fodder camps were allotted to those who have the capacity to operate them
 kisi ek kii gadabad ke liye duusare saare campon ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 After all, it is a question of millions of cattle
 jahaan hamen shikaayat milin vahaan kuch campon ke khilaaf ham karrwai ke aadesh pehle hi jari kar chuke hai
 And if complaints come, we will take action regardless of the person and the party
 'vahiin, maamle main pratikriya dete hue bhartiya janata party kii pravaktaa shweta shalini ne daawa kiya ki maharashtra main koi chaara ghotaalaa nahin hua he
 There are five teams to monitor it and if any disturbances are found, we will take action, but the name of Maharashtra should not be discredited
 'udhar, india today kii jaanch kii report saamne aane ke baad maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri prithviraj chouhan ne rajya sarkaar par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa
 He said, 'it is being played with the lives of farmers
 sarkaar ko doshiyon ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaanaa chahie or aropiyon ko jail main band karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, Beed District Chief Aastik Kumar Pandey said that the fund has been allocated based on the number of cattle
 agar maamle main kisi bhi tarah aniyamitata pai jaati he, to karrwai kii jaaegi
 Camps involved in the fodder scam can also be blacklisted
 madhya pradesh vidhansabha se barkhaast kiye gaye do sadasyon kii bahaali ke liye vishesh-satr 27 july ko bulaayaa jayega

 aise main jiesti parishad bhi petrol-dijal ko lekar koi ahm faisla is baithak main le sakati he
 It will be priced at 28% GST, if petrol-diesel is brought under the GST, then a maximum of 28% tax can be imposed on it
 kyonki jiesti main yahi sabase zyada tex slab he
 On charging 28 per cent tax, a liter of petrol will cost you around Rs 43 in Delhi
 joki petrol kii maujuuda keemton se lagbhag aadha he
 Excise and VAT will end if petrol comes under GST, then excise duty and VAT imposed by states will end
 nai tex niti ke tahat dealer kamishan judane ke baad ek litre petrol kii keemat 33
 66 becomes Rs
 isamen 28 fisadi jiesti jodne par aapako 9
 42 more will have to be given
 is tarah 1 litre petrol dilli main aapako 43
 08 will be available for Rs

 This will not put much pressure on the common man's pocket even if the prices change internationally

 After this decision, the army has become angry
 sena kaa kahana he ki yah faisla saare insaanon, dharmon or sabhyataaon ke khilaaf he
 Army spokesman Major General Asif Gafoor said, "the apprehensions about the brief decision given on 17 December have been proved correct after today's detailed decision
" aaj kaa faisla or khaastaur par isamen istemaal kiye gayi shabd insaaniyat, dharm, sabhyataa or anya kisi bhi mulya ke khilaaf hai
 He said that Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Prime Minister Imran Khan discussed in detail the issue of conviction of Musharraf and took some important decisions which will be announced soon
 vistrut faisla aane se kuch ghante pehle musharraf ne apane khilaaf mukademe par gambhir sawaal khadey kiye the

 Musharraf said that the verdict of the court was in question and it did not follow the law
 unhone adaalat ke faisle ke baad logon or sashastr balon kaa unka saath dene ke liye aabhaar jataayaa
 The former dictator said that he will decide his future after talking to his lawyers and he hopes that justice will happen

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's planetary condition is not doing well
 bijepi se pallaa jhaadne ke baad ve narendra modi ke khilaaf bayaanbaji main lag gaye
 All his time was spent in criticism of Modi, but when the law and order situation started deteriorating in the state, his popularity began to decline rapidly
 or ab lalu prasad ke jail se baahar nikal jane ke baad unke saamne ek puraani chunauti nae rup main khadi he
 Now another strong opponent is standing in front of Nitish Kumar
 ab tak to vah narendra modi par apane vyangy baan chhodkar khush ho rahe the lekin ab unhen roj lalu prasad ke contile baanon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Even though Lalu Prasad has announced two hands to the communal forces as soon as he gets out of Ranchi jail, his eyes are on Pataliputra
 or is baat ko nitish bhalee bhaanti jaanate hai
 But the good governance slogan with which Nitish Kumar came to power in Bihar seems to be tiring
 rajya main lau and order kii haalat kharaab he
 Out of its 38 districts, 16 Naxalites are victims of violence and in many areas even the police are afraid to go
 is mudde par grih mantri scindia ke patr se vah khaase bhinnaae hue hai jisamen un par is maamle main dhilaai baratane kaa aarope laga he
 Perhaps Nitish Kumar felt that the Congress government at the center was not happy with the repeated criticism of Narendra Modi
 lekin naksaliyon ne jis tarah khule aam police karmiyon ko maar daalaa or unke hathiyaar lut liye, usase kendra behad naaraaz he
 His opponents allege that Nitish Kumar is not interested in anti-naxal campaigns for fear of a loss of popularity
 naksaliyon ke khilaaf abhiyaanon se gramin kaaphi musiibat main pad jate hai
 Vote politics prevents all Chief Ministers from taking such steps and Nitish Kumar is no exception
 bihar main jis tarah indian mujahidin ne apni jaden majboot kar leen, vah rajya sarkaar kii khud kii dein he
 Despite the advice of the Intelligence Bureau, the police there did not take any action
 darasal alpsankhyakon ko apni ore karne ke prayaas main lage nitish kumaar kisi tarah kii vivaad nahin chaahate the
 The result was a blast in Narendra Modi's meeting in which many innocents were killed
 lekin nitish kumaar ko koi fark nahin padaa or ve bayaan hi dete rahe
 He did not mind even after IM exposed many terrorists
 rajya main badhate aparaadh unke sushasan ke daawey ko khokhla kar rahe hai
 Instead of facing them, they are resorting to rhetoric
 unhen lagata he ki isse unki chhavi bedaag bani rahegi
 But this is not happening
 log ab sarkaar se sawaal puch rahe hai
 After breaking ties with BJP, Nitish Kumar now has the work of so many ministries that he is unable to do anything
 rajya main kaam kaaj thap hota ja rahaa he
 Now Lalu Prasad's return from jail will prove to be a bigger headache for him than Narendra Modi
 lalu ek samay alpsankhyakon ke priy the, yah baat nitish kamaar acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 Returning from jail, he will first try to put "robbery" on Nitish Kumar's vote bank
 jis alpsankhyak vot kii khatir unhone bijepi se kinaaraa kar liya, uske unase dur ho jane kaa khatra ab saamne he
 BRT farewell to Delhi is fixed
 khanpur se moolchand ke bich bana biarti koridor jab se astitv main aayaa he, virodh hi ho rahaa he
 The corridor less than six km away was known till the Kashmiri Gate but the corridor was not even there
 jab bhi virodh uthaa is maang ke saath ise khatm kiya jaae
 Not that it should be improved
 2008 se 2014 ke bich dilli main biarti kaa itihaas yahi bataata he
 The basis of this entire protest was car vs bus, but now that the protest has reached near success, it is being argued that it should not be made the issue of car vs bus
 biarti ko kaamyaab banane ke liye kisi netaa ne ichha shakti kaa pradarshan nahin kiya
 If BRT had not started in Delhi, it would have been different today if it had not started in South Delhi
 tab kisi kaa dhyaan bhi nahin jaataa ki biarti kaa kya ho rahaa he
 The voice of the influential drivers here is more than the bus
 magar ise khatm karne se pehle sochna chahie ki biarti or iske jaisi yojanaon kaa mul makasad kya he
 This should not be an extension of the public transport system
 puri duniya main is baat par sahmati he ki alag-alag prakaar ke public transport kaa vikaas kiya jaae taaki shahar kii nirbharta kaaron par kam ho sake
 Cars have taken over our city
 car zaruri hai lekin kya koi chiz itani zaruri ho jaaegi ki ham puri dharti ko isi se paat denge
 Move to Delhi's Gully Mohalla, tension is spread over parking
 ghar ke saamne car hataate hi vahaan pathar rakh dete hai taaki shaam ko laut kar apni car park kar saken
 There are boards outside the houses that the glass will be broken or the tire will be punctured when the car is parked in front of the gate
 ye tab he jab dilli main sadakon kii chaudaai duniya ke kai bade shaharon kii sadakon se zyada he
 The number of cars per thousand population in Delhi is extremely low compared to USA and London, even then the jam here has taken the form of a terrible problem
 yah samasya mumbai, ahmedabad, bangaloru or pune tak simit nahin he balki madhyam str ke shaharon main bhi jam bhayaavah sankat kaa rup le chukaa he
 Due to the jam, we are spending three to four hours on the road every day
 ek to kaam ke dabaav ke kaaran aise hi samay kam he doosraa jam main fanse hone ke kaaran parivaar yaa khud ke liye bhi samay nahin bachataa
 If you calculate it then you will be able to understand why the public transport system is being talked about
 is car ne hamen saamaajik haisiyat to di he magar hamaari saamaajik zindagi barbaad kar di he
 Many measures are taken to avoid this problem
 kahin car pooling he to kahin numberon ke hisaab se kaaron ke chalane kaa din tay hota he to kahin anaap-shanaap maatra main fliover banaae ja rahe hai
 Even then the jams are not decreasing
 fliover ko fliover se jod kar dekha ja chukaa he, fliover ke upar fliover banaakar dekha ja chukaa he magar jam se mukti nahin mili he
 Metro has made people habit of public transport system to a great extent, but it is so expensive that it cannot run with everyone
 metro ke nirmaan main lagane vaala samay nishchit rup se kahin zyada he
 Therefore, it is important to promote buses other than metro
 bason ko badhaava dene ke liye biarti ek acha vikalp ban kar aayaa
 There was protest from the beginning in Delhi, but it was successfully managed in Ahmedabad
 aisa nahin he ki ahmedabad kii biarti kii dikkatein nahin hai magar vahaan sarkaar ne ichha shakti to dikhaai
 Today, the 80 to 90 km BRT corridor in Ahmedabad has been expanded while 6 km in Delhi could not be completed
 bees saal pehle brazil ke ek shahar se shuru hua yah prayog public transport kaa ek kargar poorak sabit ho rahaa he
 The supplement therefore states that BRT is not a solution in itself
 jahaan metro nahin vahaan aap bas len, jahaan bas nahin vahaan aap mono rail len or jahaan zaruri he vahaan car se bhi jaaen
 Parking fees of cars have been made expensive in many countries of the world
 hatotsahit kiya ja rahaa he ki car lekar na nikalen
 Public transport is being improved for this
 dilli main parking fees to mahangi kii ja rahi he magar public transport kaa pataa nahin
 Even the DTC does not have a place to park its buses
 iske liye use yamuna nadi kaa atikaraman karnaa padaa he
 London is spending a billion pounds today encouraging people to ride bicycles
 itane kharch ke baad bhi vahaan cycle chaalak paanch pratishat nahin hai jabaki dilli main 30 pratishat se zyada log cycle chalaate hai
 But have you ever heard the voice of these bicycles? Has any government favored them? Seriously tried to make a track for a bicycle? ham sara jor car par dete hai
 We have accepted that there is growth from the car itself, but in countries where the public transport system is developing, the anti-car front is not open
 vahaan bhi kaaren bik rahi hai
 Many people have started going on an amateur bicycle tour in Delhi
 mere hi kai mitra ravivaar ko dilli main lambii duuri kii cycling karte hai
 If the middle class were against a car-free urban environment, the passerby at Connaught Place would not have succeeded
 kanat place ke saath-saath desh ke anya kai shaharon main rahgeeri nahin failati
 Passenger's success tells that people are fed up with the car but there are few options to leave the car and leave the house
 galati logon kii nahin he, sarkaar kii he
 If she creates a network of public transport system then people will also use car options
 ek din cycle se jaaenge, ek din bas se or ek din metro se or baaki din car se bhi
 The government understands that people in cars are against separate corridors for buses
 yah sahi bhi he magar kyon hai ise samajha janaa chahie
 Apart from saving the city of Delhi from traffic jam, one should think about alternatives like BRT for saving some time for their personal life
 aakhir beijing shahar main kyon biarti ko apanaaya gaya
 Why BRT has 160 corridors in the world today
 dakshin dilli ke jis hisse main biarti he vahaan bas or cycle chaalkon ko kaaphi phayda hua
 Their numbers have increased
 chunki yah galiyara itnaa chota he ki unhen bhi kai baar lagata he ki iskaa koi laabh nahin
 As they exit the BRT corridor, they are caught in the same jam
 unki dharna par vahi anubhav haaavee rahata hoga
 BRT has its own problems but are not the problems of normal roads
 fliover se jam dur nahin hua to kya hamane us par paise bahaanaa band kar diya
 Why does BRT have to stop talking? 1957 main ai dilip kumaar kii film 'nayaa daur' kaa wo aakhri seen yaad kiijie
 In that film, the bus was defeated by horse racing, in Delhi the bus has lost once again
 is baar baiylgaadee se nahin car se
 The destiny of the buses is to lose

 The Indian Air Force on Sunday shared a poem on its Twitter handle to salute Abhinandan Varthaman
 vayusena ne 'vipin elahabaadi'kii likhi kavita apane handle par saajha kii he or iskaa sheershak he 'sabake bas kii baat nahin'
 There are a few lines of the poem - 'what you did not matter to everyone, it's not about everyone
 akhetak kaa kiya akhet, yah sabake bas kii baat nahin
 Janani, you are the pride of the birthplace, you place you on the highest peak
 jo tum kar paae ek jivan main, vah sabake bas kii baat nahin'
 Let us tell you that two days ago the Airforce shared a poem
 is kavita ke jariyepakistan ko ishaaron-ishaaron main chetavanee di he

 com / rlhhqfhf13 Through the poem, the Air Force had indirectly explained why it had to cross the border
 kavita kaa sheershak chaa- 'had sarhad kii'
 The whole poem is like this, "today someone has crossed the borders, because someone has crossed all limits
 us ladaaku main, jiskaa arth mrigamarichika he, ek haqiqat, gayi raat hamane bayaan kii
 Today someone crossed the borders 
 
 '' aapako bataa den ki kal hividesh mantralay ne kaha tha kibhartiya vayusena (aieef) ke ladaaku vimaan mig-21 bison ne pakistan vaayu sena ke ladaaku vimaan epa-16 ko gira diya tha or iske liye pratyakshdarshiyon ke saath-saath electronic sakshya bhi hai
 The mig-21 was flown by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman
 mantralay ne kaha ki pakistan ke epa-16 vimaanon or emram missile kaa prayog karne ke bhi sakshya he or vimaan tathaa missile ke tukade maukey se baraamad kiye gayi the
 Let us tell you that after the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, on 26 February, India attacked the terrorist bases of Jaish, which were on Pakistani territory
 bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main jaish e mohammad keatanki shivi par 1000 kilo ke bam giraayethe
 It was reported that many terrorists were killed
 bharat ne kareeb 12 miraj ladaaku vimaanon kaa istemaal kiya or1000 kilo bamon kii barishkar di
 After this Pakistan's anger started coming out and it tried to reject the claim of India
 bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai ke agle hi din pakistan ke ladaaku jahaaj bhartiya seemaa main ghusane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 The IAF gave a befitting reply to this
 vayusena keving commander abhinandan (abhinandan Varthaman) 27 farvari ko subah kareeb das baje pakistani vayusena ke fiter plane kaa peechha karte hue pakistan kii seemaa main ja ghuse the
 Abhinandan's plane also crashed after Pakistan killed the F-16
 is vajah se unhen kisi tarah parachute kii madad se utarana padaa
 He was later released by Pakistan after nearly 60 hours

 ek hi parivaar ke 11 sadasyon kii ek hi raat main achaanak hui maut ko lekar jaanch main ab tak kai hairaan kar dene vaali baaten saamne ai hai
 Three days after the incident, Dinesh, the third brother living in Chittorgarh, has appeared
 haalanki unhone mauton ke peeche tantra-mantra or dharmandhta yaa kisi tantric kii baat hone se inkaar kiya he
 Dinesh also told the secret of those 11 pipes coming out of the house
 dinesh kaa kahana he ki pipe se moksh milane vaali baat bilkul galat he
 He said that in fact his brother had a job of plywood, because of this a lot of gas was produced and these 11 pipes were installed so that the gas would continue to flow
 unka saaf-saaf kahana he, 'krime branch jo baaten kar rahi he wo bilkul galat hai
 Our family was a religious family
 is tarah kii koi baat nahin thi
 We completely deny this
 police maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi he
 We do not know what the register is about
 yah aatmahatya kaa maamla nahin he hatya kaa maamla he
 At the same time, Dinesh's sister Sujata says that her family is religious, but was not superstitious at all
 sujatha ne mauton ke peeche tantra-mantra yaa tantric vidya se puri tarah inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki unke parivaar ne aatmahatya nahin kii, balki unki hatya kii gai he
 Regarding the 11 pipes coming out of the house, Sujata says that these pipes were installed for ventilation and a solar project
 kahin na kahin kuch sajeesh he
 How the mystery of 11 deaths is connected to 11 pipes! Tell us that a total of 11 pipes have come out of the house of the victim in Sant Nagar of Burari
 police sutron kaa kahana he ki 11 pipon main 7 pipon ke munh upar kii ore hai, jabaki 4 pipon ke munh sidhe hai
 Please tell that 7 women and 4 male members were among those who died
 darasal, bhaatia parivaar ke ghar main lage in pipon ko maut se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Because there are a total of 11 pipes in the house which are not installed for any use
 pipe ko dekhakar saaf hota he ki parivaar ko andhvishwaas jakadaaa hua tha
 Because the number of dead in the house is 11, and the pipes are also 11
 iske alaava marane waalon main 7 mahilaayein or 4 purush hai
 While 7 of the 11 pipes in the wall of the house are bent and 4 are straight
 chote bhai lalit ke vash main tha puraa parivarpulice sutron ke mutabik, lalit ke bataae anusaar hi shanivaar der raat ghar ke sabhi sadasyon ne pehle puja anushthan kiya tha
 In fact, after the father's death, he claimed that the father was visible to him
 darasal is puure puja-anushthan kii baaten lalit ko uske pita ne sapane main hi bataai thim or moksh hasil karne ke liye kaha tha
 Police sources say that the tantra-mantra, salvation and religious rituals written in both registers found near the temple built inside the house are in Lalit's handwriting
 police ke mutabik, lalit kaa kahana he ki uske mrit pita uske sapane main aate hai or unheen kii baaten usne register main likhi hai
 The family wanted to escape salvation, the Bharosadilli Police Crime Branch had at first felt that the whole family had trapped themselves in a trap of bigotry and committed suicide collectively to attain salvation through tantra-mantra and religious rituals
 lekin ab aisi baaten saamne aa rahi hai ki parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy maranaa nahin chahta tha, balki sirf moksh paanaa chahta tha
 According to important information received from the police sources, it is known from the things written in the register and the chance that the whole family was performing a ritual
 haath or munh par pattee baandhakar latakana isi anushthan kaa antim charan tha or parivaar ko shaayad yah vishwaas tha ki wo batch jaaenge
 Everyone was told that Vat Puja leads to darshan of God
 bargad kii tarah latakkar puujakarne se kisi kii jaan nahin jaaegi
 God will not let anyone die
 lalit kaa kahana tha ki uske pita sapane main use yahaan tak bataate the ki ghar or kaarobaar ke sambandh main kya karnaa he or kahaan paisa lagaana he
 It was written in the register, 'you will not die, you will achieve something big'
 Police said that Lalit had written in the register, 'father has said that at the last moment there will be a shock, the sky will move, the earth will move
 lekin tum ghabraana mat, mantra jaap tej kar dena,main tumhen bachaa luungaa
 Getting down when the water changes color, helping each other down
 tum maroge nahin, balki kuch bada hasil karoge
 The police say that the entire family had performed the puja ritual on Saturday night only on Lalit's behest
 ghar main havan kiya gaya tha or ek bottle main pani bhi bhar kar rakhaa hua tha
 It was also written in the register that if the bandage of the hand is left, double it on the mouth
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sirf lalit or uski patni tina ke haath nahin bandhe hue the
 There is also a mention of 'vat Savitri Pooja' in the register
 darasal vat savitri puja poornima ke dauraan kii jaati he or jis raat parivaar waalon kii maut hui, yani 27-28 june kii raat bhi poornima hi thi
 However, it is believed that Vat Savitri is worshiped by wives for the long life of her husband

 The campaign was scheduled to end one day later on Friday evening
 ayog ne mangalvaar ko kolkata main bhaajapa tathaa trinmul congress ke samarthakon ke bich jhadpon ke baad yah faisla kiya
 On May 19, the Election Commission implemented Article 324 of the Constitution to stop campaigning for the final phase of elections
 ayog ne pashchim bengal ke pradhan sachiv (grih) atri bhattacharya or siaidi ke atirikt mahanideshak rajeev kumaar ko unke padon se hataane kaa bhi aadesh diya
 To this, Banerjee said that both the officers were removed not by the Election Commission, but by Modi and Amit Shah
 ' Reacting to the statement of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan of the state for not misusing the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of Atrocities) Act in Madhya Pradesh, State Congress President Kamal Nath said that the Chief Minister is not above the law
 chouhan dwaara balaghat main essi / asti act ke sambandh main diye bayaan par puche gayi sawaal ke jawaab main kamalnath ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki dekhiye, mukhyamantri kanoon se upar nahin he
 He said that i would like to ask him whether you had given this statement after taking advice from (prime Minister) Narendra Modi
 kamalnath ne bataaya ki chouhan ne to mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee he
 If you read the oath, he said that we will follow the constitution and law of the country, then he should answer himself to whom he consulted
 essi / asti act kii sthiti yahaan (madhyapradesh main) kya he
 He said, no person is above the law
 na ham hote hai, na vah hote hai
 It is noteworthy that Chief Minister Chauhan had said in Balaghat on Thursday that the state government will not allow SC / ST Act to be misused in Madhya Pradesh
 is act ke tahat kii gai shikayaton kii puri jaanch ke baad hi kisi ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya jaayegaa
 There will be no arrest without investigation
 iske liye madhyapradesh sarkaar dwaara jald hi nirdesh jari kiya jaayegaa
 Significantly, the Congress leader Digvijay Singh had targeted Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Uma Bharti over the Vyapam scam
 purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne vyapam ghotaale main bhagidaari ko lekar shivaraj singh chouhan or uma bharti samet 18 logon ke khilaaf chayika daayar kii he
 In this petition, Digvijay Singh has alleged that these people have tampered with the Indore Police Axle Sheet
 is maamle ko lekar digvijay singh ne vishesh jaj suresh singh kii adaalat main apana bayaan darj karaayaa
 The special thing is that Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha are favoring Digvijay Singh
 khaas baat yah he ki kuch maheene pehle hi vyapam ghotaalaa maamle main sibiai sanvida shiksha pariksha varg-3 main gadabadi ke maamle main chargeshit daakhil kar di thi
 This charge sheet came as a relief for Union Minister Uma Bharti
 kyonki maamle main unhen clin chit mil gai he
 In the case, the agency has filed a charge sheet against 95 accused, including 83 candidates
 vyapam ghotaale ko lekar uma bharti mukhar thim, lekin congress ne aarope lagaaya ki sanvida shiksha pariksha varg-3 main do ummidavaaron kii sifarish main uma kaa naam bhi excel shit main he
 But Master Mind Pankaj Trivedi and Nitin Mohindra did not say anything about this, which gave Uma a clean chit
 (input bhashaa se) In the Ashok Gehlot government of Rajasthan, 23 ministers were sworn in on Monday
 soobe ke 11 fisadi muslim samaaj se mahaj ek mantri ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya gaya
 While 7 mlas from the Muslim community have come from the party
 congress kii is andekhi se muslim samaaj naaraaz najar aa rahaa he
 The 'rajasthan Meo Panchayat' has written a letter to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot demanding that he be made a minister from the Muslim Meo society
 bataa den ki congress ne vidhansabha chunaav main 15 muslim ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaara tha, jinamein se 7 muslim jeetne main safal rahe the
 Apart from this, a seat has a Muslim MLA from BSP
 congress se jaahida khan, saleh mohammad, hakam ali, rafique khan, amin kagaji, amin khan, danish abraar or basapa se vaazib ali khan vidhayak bane hai
 The Congress has created a formula for the cabinet that mlas who win for the first time will not be given a chance
 aise main paanch vidhayak aise hai jo pehali baar vidhayak bane hai
 While there are three Congress mlas who have won more than once
 is formule ke tahat gahalot ke nae mantrimandal main saleh mohammad mantri banaaya ja rahaa he
 While Zahida Khan's name was also running for minister
 maslim samaaj or sanghathanon ne gahalot sarkaar main muslim numaaindgi ko lekar sawaal khadey karne shuru kar die hai
 He feels that the Congress has ignored him
 itnaa hi nahin rajasthan main musalamaanon ke sabase majboot votbank maane jane vaale muslim mev samaaj ko tavajjo nahin mili he
 There is great resentment in the Meo society about this
 jabaki soobe main alvar or bharatpur samet kai jilon main mev samaaj ke matadaataaon kii acchhee khaasi taadaad he
 Chaudhary Shabbir Ahmed, president of the Rajasthan Muslim Meo Samaj, has written to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot saying that the Meo Samaj has unitedly voted for the Congress in the state
 aise main mev samaaj se jite hue vidhayakon ko mantri nahin banane se samaaj main rosh he
 If this attitude is there then the party may have to suffer loss in the Lok Sabha elections
 milli council ke rajasthan adhyaksh abdul qayyum ne kaha, 'muslim samaaj se mahaj ek mantri bananaa saraasar ninsaphi he
 In this regard, our delegation met with the Chief Minister and demanded to increase the participation of Muslims
 soobe main pehle kii congress sarkaar main ek se zyada mantri rahe hai
 Mohammad Zahid said that there is no one left in Delhi to raise the voice of the Muslims of Rajasthan
 isi kaa nateeja he ki musalamaanon kii sarkaar main bhaagedari na ke baraabar he
 Whereas in one way there were leaders like Tayyab Chaudhary
 ab unki kami khal rahi he
 Congress is taking advantage of this because Muslims do not have an option
 bataa den ki rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav main muslim matadaataaon ne ekajute hokar congress ko vot diya tha
 As a result, instead of Younus Khan, a veteran BJP leader and a Muslim face from Tonk seat, he won the Muslim society by voting for Sachin Pilot of Congress

 haalanki kejariwal kaa drugs ke mudde par maafee maangana or khalistaani tatwon se samarthan ke aarope ne party kii is chunaav main sambhaavnaaon ko jhatka pahunchaaya he
 Until five years ago, the same Kejriwal was shown black flags in Sangrur on Monday, in which Kejriwal was considered to be a protector and protector from the menace of drugs
 2014 main punjab loksabhaa chunaav main party ke achche pradarshan kaa asar 2017 punjab vidhansabha chunaav main bhi dekhne ko mila
 Kejriwal's party pushed Punjab's traditional party Shiromani Akali Dal to number three and became the second party and got the status of the main opposition party
 2017 ke baad badale halatsaal 2017 ke baad se hi aam aadmi party ke liye halaat mushkil hote gaye
 Kejriwal apologized against Akali leader Bikram Majithia for his allegations of holding him responsible for the drugs problem
 is ghatnakram ne punjab main party ke samarthan aadhaar ko kam karne kaa kaam kiya
 If not, then Kejriwal would not have to be on the backfoot this time in the election campaign
 punjab main aam aadmi party ke liye bhagwant maan sabase bade daanv hai
 Maan is leaving no stone unturned to beat the tempo from Sangrur on his own
 maan kehete hai, “ham pichhali baar se bhi badhiya pradarshan is baar karne ja rahe hai
 People are angry with Captain Amarinder Singh government for not fulfilling the promises

 "dharamvir Gandhi had said that the outgoing MP from Hamadapatiala, Dharamvir Gandhi had come into the limelight all over the country by defeating Captain Amarinder Singh's wife and Congress heavyweight candidate Parneet Kaur on the AAP ticket in 2014

 Gandhi has entered the electoral battle this time as a candidate of the Punjab Democratic Alliance (PDA) made up of several smaller parties in Punjab
 gandhi kehete hai, ‘kejariwal ne swaraj or party main loktantr kaa vaada kiya
 He had said that there would be no high command in the party and local leaders would be made strong
 hakeekat main unhone dilli se netaa punjab par thope
 The people of Punjab have taught them a lesson

 Except Bhagwant Mann, all his candidates will lose the election
 ’punjab main is baar aap kii agniparikshabante hue ghar ke saath aam aadmi party kii punjab main is baar agnipariksha he
 Two of the party's four mps have left together
 punjab main party ke aadha darjan se adhik vidhayakon ne apana alag morcha bana liya he, jisase kejariwal ko chunaav main chunauti di ja sake
 Leaving with senior leaders made it difficult for the party to find strong candidates in many seats
 AAP kii ore se vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bane vipaksh ke netaa sukhpal singh kheda ko party pehle hi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa chuki he
 Kheda formed his own Punjab Ekta Party and is now contesting in Bathinda against Union minister and Akali Dal candidate Harsimrat Kaur Badal
 kheda kehete hai, “kejariwal ne drugs ke nasoor ko ukhaad phenkane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin baad main majithia se maafee maang lee
 Their base is over
 kejariwal ne ye kasam bhi khai thi ki kabhi bhrasht congress ke saath haath nahin milaayenge, lekin haal main sabane dekha vah kaise congress ke saath gathbandhan ke liye gidgidaate rahe
 "AAP is confident of repeating the performance, although AAP central leaders are still confident of repeating the 2014 performance in Punjab
" party netaa or rajyasabha sadsy sanjay singh ne india today ko bataaya, “hamane apni khaamiyon ko lekar aatmamanthan kiya
 Organization was changed in Punjab
 kuch khamiyaan thim, lekin ham phir is baar vaapasi karenge
 "let us know that voting has been done for seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 AAP ke kendriya netaa ab punjab main party ko or kisi sharmindagi se bachaane ke liye puraa jor laga rahe hai
 But this time it seems difficult for the party

 ) Moving cautiously on a controversial and politically sensitive issue like the caste-based census, the government on Wednesday decided to set up a group of ministers for a detailed discussion on the subject
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main cabinet kii baithak main is vishay par hui charchaa main kuch mantriyon ne jati aadhaarit janaganana kaa sarmathan kiya jabaki kuch anya ne aapatti jataai
 Sources said that in this cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Home Minister p Chidambaram, Law Minister Veerappa Moily, Human Resources Development Minister Kapil Sibal, Sports Minister MS Gill, Commerce Minister Anand Sharma, Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Social Justice Minister Mukul Wasnik gave his views
 inke anusaar sibbal or gil ne kaha ki janaganana kii prakriya shuru ho chuki he or bich main jati ko shaamil kiya janaa thik nahin rahegaa
 Moily, an open supporter of the inclusion of caste in the census, said that caste could be easily included in the second and third cycles when the National Population Register process started
 bataaya jaataa he ki vaasanic ne bhi janaganana main jati ko shaamil kiye jane kii himaayat kii
 Anand Sharma, who had earlier opposed the inclusion of caste in the census, kept a balanced view on it
 sadasyon ke bich mat bhinnata ko dekhte hue cabinet ne is mudde par mantriyon ke samooh kaa gathan karne kaa nirnay kiya
 The group is expected to be chaired by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
 sutron ne bataaya ki mantriyon kaa samooh agar janaganana main jati ko shaamil karne kaa faisla hota he to vah uske taur tareeke bhi sujhaayega
 The last caste-based census was done in the country in 1931
 is samvedansheel vishay par sifarish dene ke liye mantriyon ke samooh ko koi samay seemaa nahin di gai he lekin usase ummid he ki vah jald se jald aisa kare
 The issue was also discussed in the last cabinet meeting held on May 4, but a consensus could not be reached
 bataaya jaataa he ki grih mantralay chahta he ki shuru ho chuki janaganana prakriya ko isi tarah chalane diya jaae or baad main biomitric namoonay lene kaa kaam shuru hone par jati ko shaamil kiya jaae
 Several political parties including SP, RJD and JDU are under pressure on the government to conduct caste-based census
 haal hi main sampann sansad ke bajet satr main bhi yah mudda pramukhataa se uthaa tha or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne loksabhaa main aashwaasan diya tha ki is bare main nirnay karne se pehle sadasyon kii bhaawanaaon ko samahit kiya jayega
 On Monday, the Prime Minister had said about this in a press conference that a decision will be taken in the Cabinet in this matter and the process is still going on

 Food made in water containing chloramine can prove to be dangerous for your health
 ek nae shodh ke mutabik, chloramin yukt pani or namak pratikriya kar aise hanikaarak rasayanon kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo aapako aspataal pahunchane ke liye kaaphi hai
 The research team has discovered many new molecules that are completely new and are formed by the reaction between chlorinated water and iodized salt present in food
 pani ko svachh karne ke liye usamen yaa to chlorine yaa chloramin ke anu milaae jate hai
 According to the team of researchers, the chlorine or chloramines present in tap water react with the iodine salt to form hypoiodosic acid, which is not generally harmful
 jab yah acid bhojan pakaate samay nalke pani main maujuud anuon or anya carbonic (jaev) padaarthon ke saath pratikriya karata he, tab isse hanikaarak iodinoyus keetanunashak (ai-dibipi) kaa nirmaan hota he
 Assistant Professor at Hong Kong University, Drs
 shiyangru jhang ke anusaar, 'khaanaa banaate samay bana ai-dibipi paryaavarniya rasayanavidon va ejiniyaron ke liye bilkul nayaa he
 The researchers made food with water from different taps at different temperatures and studied the i-dbp produced by adding iodized salt to it

 Cooking food for a short time at low temperatures also limits the formation of I-DBP

 Baba intervened in the fierce national debate on rape by making many outrageous statements on the Delhi rape case from the stage of his camp
 baba kii tippaniyon ne un purush aparaadhiyon kii bajaae, jinhone us ladki ke saath balaatkaar kiya tha, dilli kii divangat balaatkaar peedita ko hi gunaahagaar bana daalaa
 He said that if the girl had recited the Saraswati mantra or taken initiation from them, she would not have boarded the bus
 isse pehle unhone kaha ki yadi usne balaatkaariyon ko bhai kaha hota to shaayad ve uske saath balaatkaar hi na karte
 Meanwhile, he also made an objectionable statement, 'one cannot clap with one hand
 'vivaadaaspad guru ke andh bhakton ko shiksha di gai he ki guru par sawaal uthaane par narak milanaa tay he
 Therefore, instead of expelling them from this terrible controversy, they contributed to making them more terrible by defending them
 jaisaa ki asaram kii ek pravaktaa neelam doobe ne kaha, ''baba ke bayanon ko bahut adhik todaa-maroda gaya he
 They were not blaming the victim, but merely saying that she was also at least one percent responsible because she made the mistake of boarding an almost empty bus in which there was no woman present
 ''asaram ke bayaan kii chautarafa aalochana hui lekin baba par koi asar na hua or ve balaatkaariyon ko mrityu dand dene ke vichaar kaa virodh kar apane vivaadaaspad bayanon par kaayam rahe
 He argued, "it will be used by women of loose character against men in the same way as strict anti-dowry laws are being used by some women to harass their husbands

 The rise of Asumal Thaumal Harpalani alias Asaram Bapu as a spiritual master of the kingdom has been like a dream

 After 20, Asaram went to his ashram in Adipur, Kutch to seek the blessings of Lilashah Baba
 lilashah baba ek sammanit aadhyatmik vyakti the or unka dehanth 1973 main hua
 The Sindhi elders of Kutch say that Lilashah Baba did not like Asaram at the time of his death, yet Asaram Bapu's followers point out that Lilashah was his mentor
 asaram ke liye bura daur 2008 se lekar 2010 ke bich aayaa jab unhen or unke putr narayan sai ko mahilaon ke yon shoshan, tantric uddeshyon ke liye bacchon kii bali or hinsa kaa istemaal kar jameen hathiyaane jaise aaropon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But these allegations could not be proved

 As his devoted disciple Udaya Sanghani says, 'charges have been leveled against Bapu by disgruntled people who wanted to do something unfair to Bapu and which he could never get done
 unke anuyaayiyon kii sankhya isliye badi he kyonki baapu ke saath apane aadhyatmik anubhav se labhanvit hone vaale logon ne jhuthe aaropon par aadhaarit media ke nakaaratmak prachaar kii bajaae apane anubhav par bharosa kiya or ve apni bhavanaaen nae logon se saz karte gaye

 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham raah main nahin aaenge
 '' rakanpa pramukh ne aaj kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri ke samaksh is mudde ko uthaaya
 The NCP is the first constituent of the UPA which has openly supported the early decision on Telangana and is expecting a UPA meeting soon in this regard

 In view of the growing stature of Modi in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress's Chief Election Committee is considering all options
 isi ke tahat media main aa rahi khabaron ke mutabik congress ne bharat ratna sachin tendulkar se modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ke liye sampark kiya tha
 But the 'god of Cricket' turned down the offer
 vartmaan main sachin tendulkar rajyasabha ke saansad hai or khabaron main kaha ja rahaa he ki wo loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate
 Earlier, during the assembly elections held in five states, the Madhya Pradesh Congress had demanded the party high command to make Sachin a star campaigner
 haalanki us vakt bhi sachin ne chunaav abhiyaan main kisi bhi tarah kii bhoomika nibhaane se saaf inkaar kar diya tha
 Let me tell you that in honor of Sachin Tendulkar, India Today Group organized an event called 'salaam Sachin' in Mumbai, in which BCCI Vice President and Union Minister Rajiv Shukla said that there is no question of Sachin coming into politics is
 shukla ne kaha tha ki sachin ne apane pita se teen ahm vaade kiye the, kabhi cigarette nahin pienge, kabhi sharaab nahin pienge or kabhi raajnneeti main nahin jaaenge
 Meanwhile, the UP Congress has suggested the name of former BJP President Ajay Rai against Modi
 ajay raay ne bijepi chhodane ke baad saal 2009 ke aam chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke tikat par chunaav ladaa tha
 UP Congress believes that Ajay Rai is quite popular in Benaras

 In 2004, Rajesh Kumar Mishra of Congress reached Parliament by winning by two lakh votes
 lekin 2009 main bijepi ke murali manohar joshi ne varanasi se jeet hasil kii or mishra chauthe number par khisak gaye the
 At that time, Ajay Rai, the candidate of the Samajwadi Party, stood third

 Karthik was in the dressing room with team coach Brendon mccullum

 a senior official of the board while talking to IANS has confirmed this and said that Karthik should have taken permission before doing so as he is still on the board's list of central contract players

 The official said, "since he is a player of the Indian team, there are certain protocols that have to be followed

 unhone kaha ki priyanka gandhi wadra yuvaaon kaa vot hasil karne main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ke liye sahaayak hongi
 Also, this brother-sister duo will prove to be the turning point for the party in the Lok Sabha elections as the country needs a youth team
 pitroda ne kaha ki rahul (rahul Gandhi) - priyanka (priyanka Gandhi), donon log party main sakriy sachin payalat, jyotiraditya sindhiya or milind devda sahit anya kai yuva netaaon ke saath ek shandaar team banaaenge
 These people will take the country forward instead of hanging it on history and religion

 Pitroda, who headed the Knowledge Commission during the Manmohan Singh (former prime minister) government, said in an interview from Chicago that India needs a young leadership with an inclusive vision for the future, who will take care of employment and for everyone
 Brought new opportunities
 gandhi parivaar ke lambey samay se mitra rahe pitroda ne kaha ki bharat ko aaj aise vyakti kii jarurat he, jo timwork, saamanjasy or sahyog main yakeen rakhata ho va yah kendrikrut shakti centre ke ulat he
 India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in faith and not in deceit, who believes in inclusion and not in excluding anyone

 When asked about Priyanka Gandhi's debut in active politics as Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, she said that she will become a big and good leader
 unhone kaha ki unhen aashaa he ki priyanka ke sakriy raajnneeti main aane se chunaavon par bada prabhaav padegaa
 Pitroda said that she (priyanka) will prove to be helpful in her brother's efforts
 yuvaaon, khaastaur par mahilaon ko utsahit karne main vah unka saath dengi
 They are both young, they represent a large youth team in the party, they are modern, they are technology people and they have a respect for history and they also have a vision of the future

 On bjp's allegation of Congress promoting dynastic politics, Pitroda said that dynasty is in every field, but ultimately it is the functioning that matters
 yadi aap behatar kaam nahin karenge to vanshavaad madad nahin kar saktaa
 He said that since becoming Congress President, Rahul Gandhi's popularity has doubled day by night as he got full powers and relaxation after assuming charge of the party
