 com / qoke6npkmq Former President Pranab Mukherjee will attend the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh program in Nagpur on June 7
 isko lekar lagaataar raajnneetik bayaanbaji ho rahi he
 Congress leaders are constantly objecting to this, while the BJP is supporting it
 vahiin ab is maamle main shivasena ne bhi congress party ko nishane par liya he
 The Shiv Sena has written in the face that if the former president goes to the RSS program then why is the Congress having a stomach ache
 saamana ke lekh main likhaa gaya he ki aresas koi aatankwaadi sanghathan nahin he, agar pranab mukherjee unke kaarykram main jate hai to congress ke pet main kyon dard ho rahaa he
 It was written in Saamana that the Congress which made Pranab Mukherjee the President, today those same parties are abusing and cursing him
 or vahi jo bijepi 2012 main pranab mukherjee ko haraane ke liye qamar kas rahi thi wo aaj unki aarti utaar rahi he
 It says that politics should go in the stove, but Pranab Mukherjee is the former President of the country
 ve kis kaarykram main jaaen yaa kismen nahin ye tay karnaa unka hi adhikaar he
 The RSS is not an organization like lashkar-e-taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen or Al Qaeda
 vah ek hindutvvaadi deshbhakti sanghathan he
 Targeting the Congress, it has been said in the face that the truth is that Pranab da was not made Prime Minister despite having many years of political experience
 or ab tandav kiya ja rahaa he
 The Sangh had said- There is no shocking thing in this, the statement of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had also come on the continuing rhetoric
 RSS kii ore se kaha gaya he ki jo log sangh ko jaanate hai unke liye ye koi chaunkaane vaali baat nahin hai
 We have called big people of the country before in our programs, similarly this time we have called Pranab Mukherjee
 or ye unka badppan he ki unhone hamaara nyauta sweekaar bhi kar liya he
 Significantly, former President Pranab Mukherjee will visit the Nagpur headquarters of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on 7 June
 vah sangh shiksha varg ke tritiy varsh main shaamil ho rahe swayamsevakon ko sambodhit karenge

 So ready to join hands with Modi: Manjhi Simultaneously, Jitan Ram Manjhi appealed to the media to highlight the active 'powerful middlemen' who duped the funds of the marginalized and welfare schemes of the poor
 rashtriya press diwas ke avasar yojit ‘lok vyavhaar main paardarshita- media kii bhoomika’ vishay ek sangoshtee main maanjhi ne kaha, 'aaj kii raajnneeti main anusuchit jati, janajati, pichde varg or alpsankhyak aadi kii baton ko kahkar ham apana aadhaar banane kaa prayaas karte hai

 lekin unke liye ham kaam us tarah nahin kar rahe, jis tarah karnaa chahie
 He said that he has no hesitation in saying this
 mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ne kaha ki haashie par rahane vaale or garibon ke liye ham kaam karte bhi hai

 lekin phir bhi bichauliyon dwaara koi na koi rasta nikaalkar labhaarthiyon se raashi thagne kii baat kahi
 He said that action could not be taken against such people due to lack of witnesses and evidence
 unhone kaha, 'ham samaaj main rahane vaale log nihit swaarth ke chalate aisa nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Somewhere they retract in the name of caste, sometimes they think that it belongs to our caste, if they eat it, let it eat, and then they go back in fear
 ham janpratinidhi jaat-paat ke naam par vot lete hai or janata kii baat ko nakaar dete hai
 'manjhi said that the media is the fourth pillar of the country and if it is strong, neither the people's representatives nor administration can run away from their duties

 Baig filed an RTI application on May 10, 2012, from the Lokayukta office from May 13, 2007 to May 8, 2012, on the list of names and addresses of the people complaining against the officers and employees of various departments of the Chief Minister
 a district-wise and year-wise list of action taken and settled and convicted complaints was sought
 saath hi unhone lokayukta main darj shikaayat ke nistaaran kii samaysima evam shulk kii jaankaree bhi maangi thi
 On this, in a reply given by the Lokayukta office on 22 May 2012, it was said that it is not possible to give copies of records in view of the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Lokayukta and Deputy Lokayukta Commissioners Act 1975
 saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya ki shikayaton ke nistaaran kii koi samaysima tay nahin he
 Dissatisfied with the reply of the Lokayukta office, Baig complained to the State Information Commission on 12 July 2012, on which hearing on April 3 this year, the Commission issued a notice to the Lokayukta to ask him to explain what was not the desired information

 Describing the Lokayukta office as being an arbitrary step outside the purview of RTI, Baig said that this is a step taken to frustrate RTI activists
 vah ise ucch nyaayalay main chunauti denge
 He said that the Lokayukta office has said that under Section 8 of the RTI, investigative agencies are not covered under the Right to Information Act, which is completely wrong
 artiai kii dhara 24 (4) main spasht kiya gaya he ki koi bhi rajya maanavadhikaar or bhrashtachar se jude muddon par soochna dene par roak nahin laga saktaa
 Baig said that in the year 2010, the then Mayawati government of the state had issued a mandate and excluded the vigilance department from the purview of RTI
 unhone ise elahabaad ucch nyaayalay main janhit yachika ke jariye chunauti di thi
 He said that the court, in an order passed on October 25, 2010, said that Section 24 (4) of the Right to Information Act-2005 clearly states that any state can give information sought through RTI on human rights and corruption related issues
 Can not refuse beg ne bataaya ki nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad satarkta vibhaag ko dobaaraa artiai ke daayre main behaal kar diya gaya tha

 ajay kumarasamarji namaskara
 Samara: Namaskar, Namaskar
 kya haalchaal hai?ajayambas lage hue hai samarji
 are engaged
 samaraukahin se koi dikkat pareshaani?ajayakanhin, bas aap logon kaa saath he to, aap logon kaa itnaa prabhaav he ki aap log bol dijiega to phir koi maai kaa laal nahin roak saktaa he
 Summer: We are getting full response, not good enough? Ajay: i am getting very good
 phir aap logon kaa ishaara rah jayega or vot 1 taarikh ko he
 
 
 Ajay Kumar, who is involved in this conversation, belongs to the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha Party and has recently been elected as an MP from Jharkhand's Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat, while Samarji is said to be the general secretary of the jharkhand-bihar-orissa border area of the banned CPI (maoist)
 
 police ne yah baatcheet upachunaav ke pehle mobile colls kii nigaraanee ke dauraan 26 june ko record kii thi
 Jharkhand's BJP leader Saryu Rai made the point public on July 1, hours before voting for the Jamshedpur seat vacated by Chief Minister Arjun Munda
 is upachunaav main haare bhaajapa pradesh ikai ke adhyaksh dineshanand goswami ne chunaav ayog main shikaayat kii, jiske aadhaar par police ne ajay kumaar ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya
 After leaving the Indian Police Service in 1996, Ajay Kumar, who worked in several companies, confirmed that the voice in the CD was his own
 yah puri baatcheet saaf taur par is baat kaa udhaaharan lagati he ki mukhyadhara kii ek party chunavi safalataa ke liye ativaadiyon ke sanghathan ke saath saath-ganth kar rahi he
 But Ajay Kumar also insists that 'this person, who is being told as Samarji' should also be investigated
 unhone kaha, ''meri chhavi bilkul bedaag he
 i never asked a person or any so-called Samarji to distort the election results
 yah bhaajapa kaa bichaaya gaya jaal he
 "india Today" has a copy of this conversation recorded on CD
 usamen jharkhand vikaas morcha ke netaa prabhaat bhuiyaan or samarji ke saath hui baatcheet bhi record he
 The CD was released a day before the vote and thus the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha got a weapon against the ruling BJP: "they are misusing government machinery to straighten their political owls
" ''ajay kumaar ne goswami or raay ke khilaaf counter cese file kiya he
 Ajay Kumar alleges that these two are trying to discredit him
 raay ke mutabik yah mudda bahut chaunkaane vaala he, kyonki isamen ek purv police adhikari shaamil he
 Rai says, 'A former police officer is seeking help from a Naxalite in the election yet the police is silent
 agar koi gramin kisi maovadi ko apane ghar main khaanaa khilaa de, bhale hi aisa vah dabaav main aakar kar rahaa ho to aap use giraftaar kar lete hai
 You cannot work with such double rules
 ''jharkhand vikaas morcha ke adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri babulal marandi ne india today se baatcheet main mana ki unhone khud bhi samarji se baat kii thi, lekin uske saath koi sauda nahin hua tha
 "how can i prevent someone from talking on the phone, and that too during the election?" i have to protect my workers too
 lekin maine usase kisi tarah kii madad ke liye nahin kaha
 "but if the phone conversations are to be believed, Ajay Kumar has clearly done so
" phone par baatcheet ke dauraan samarji unke chunavi hiton par baat bhi karata he, baavjood iske ki maovadi chunaav kaa bahishkaar kar rahe the
 According to Marandi, counterattack is the best defense
 ''aap puri prakriya nibhaae bina kisi kaa phone hack karne kii ijaajat kaise de sakate hai? kya jharkhand ke grih sachiv ne phone tap kiye jane kii ijaajat di thi? sarkaar hamase jawaab maang rahi he
 We demand a judicial inquiry
 '' vaise khud ko maovadiyon se alag bataane ke marandi ke tamaam prayaason ke baavjood ab jis tarah se unhone siyaasi paala badla he, usase yah bilkul jaahir ho gaya he
 Despite being a staunch anti-naxalite and lethal attacks on him, Marandi, who escaped, has now softened and has taken the middle path
 jamshedpur main chunaav ke ek saptaah pehle marandi ne 2007 main chilakhari main hue narsanhaar, jisamen 20 gramin or unka 22 varshiya betaa anup bhi maaraa gaya tha, ke liye pakade gaye chaar naksaliyon ko maafee dene kii apil bhi kii he
 His opponents consider it as a clear indication that the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha chief was heaving Maoists before the Jamshedpur elections
 raay kehete hai, ''iske baad hui ajay kii baatcheet to maovadiyon ke saath mileebhagat ke marandi ke prayaason kaa hi vistaar he
 Marandi is not the only leader to pacify and please the Maoists
 jharkhand ke rajnatik tantra ko apane kabje main lene ke liye maovadi dabbu or darpok kism ke bahut se netaaon kaa istemaal karte rahe hai
 This is clear from some information available with the police
 rajya kaa ek bahut bada hissaa or bahut-se netaa naksaliyon ke niyantran main hai
 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MP Sunil Mahato, CPI (ma-lay) MLA Mahendra Singh and Janata Dal (U) Minister Ramesh Singh Munda have been victims of Naxalite guns

 "some politicians, bureaucrats, police, businessmen and even journalists are involved with Maoists, but concrete evidence is needed to take action," says Rath
 ''jharkhand vidhansabha ke purv adhyaksh or saansad inder singh namdhari is baat se sahamat hai ki jharkhand ke rajaneta maovadiyon ke aage ghutane tekte rahe hai
 He says, "I lost the Lok Sabha elections because i refused to give money to the rebels
" phir unhone mere kaaryakartaaon ko chunaav prachaar hi nahin karne diya

 The Bureau of Police Research and Development, Department of Home Affairs, recently conducted a survey titled 'social, Economic and Political Mobility in Extremism Affected Areas'
 iske mutabik netaaon or ativaadiyon ke bich saath-ganth he
 In Jharkhand, 61 percent of the common people and 86 percent of the working people believe that extremism has a deep impact on the politics
 udhar maovadiyon ko bhi bharosa he ki ve chunavi nateezon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Kameshwar Baitha, one of the same people, has 46 cases filed against him, he entered politics and is now a member of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha from Palamu

 It is clear that the dividing line between politicians and extremist criminals in Jharkhand is getting blurred

 30 November 2011: See India Today in pictures gujarat chunaav main abhi tak kaa sabase bada mudda yah tha ki patidaar samudaay kiskaa saath degaa
 But something happened on Wednesday that the temple has come to the center of the election
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko somnath mandir main darshan kiye
 But this philosophy was heavy for Rahul and Congress
 ek tasviir saamne ai, jisamen yah dikh rahaa tha ki rahul ne gaiyr-hindu entry register par sin kiye the
 Which BJP has made a big issue
 lekin yah puraa vivaad he kya, abhi tak kiski taraf se kya kaha gaya he
 Understand here
 
 
 aakhir mandir main kya hua tha?aapako bataa den ki rahul gandhi do divasiy daure ke liye buudhvaar ko gujarat pahunche
 He started his journey by bowing in the famous Somnath temple
 mandir main kuch aisa hua ki somnath mandir pahunchane par jab mandir kii ore se kaha gaya ki jo log gaiyr-hindu hai, ve ek alag register main sin kar den, to congress kii ore se vahaan maujuud media ko-ordinator ne ahamed patel or rahul gandhi kaa naam bataa diya
 The two leaders were then asked to sign in that register
 media ko-ordinator kii bhul?jo signechar kii tasviir viral ho rahi he usamen gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki vahaan rahul ke naam likhaa he 'rahul gandhi ji'
 It can be clearly understood that if the name is in front of him, then Rahul himself has not signed it
 kaha ja rahaa he ki media ko-ordinator manoj tyaagi ne register par donon netaaon kaa naam likhva diya tha
 The question is whether the entire controversy has arisen due to Manoj's mistake
 vivaad par kya bole manoj tyaagi ?rahul ke register main is sin kaa vivaad jab bada to manoj tyaagi ne bhi bayaan jari kiya
 He said that when i entered the temple, i wrote in my register, during that time neither Rahul Gandhi nor Ahmed Patel's name was written there
 kisi ne hamaare jane ke baad naam joda tha
 What is the statement of Somnath Temple on the dispute? Dhruv Joshi, Public Relations Officer of Somnath Temple Trust also gave a statement on this dispute
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi or ahamed patel kaa naam manoj tyaagi ne hi likhaa tha
 Due to security, according to the rules, non-hindu people have to sign if they come to the temple
 dhruv ne bataaya ki manoj tyaagi ne rahul or ahamed patel kaa naam gaiyr-hindu register main hi likhaa
 Congress bid - Rahu BJP is Shiv Devotee, as soon as the issue was redeemed, the Congress also retaliated
 congress netaa deepak hooda ne media se kaha ki bijepi rahul ke gujarat main shandaar campan se ghabara gai he, isliye is prakaar ke mudde oochaal rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi is a Shiva devotee, and believes in the truth
 rahul khud ko bataa chuke hai shivabhaktcongress netaaon ke alaava rahul gandhi khud bhi apane aap ko shivbhakt bataa chuke hai
 On November 13, in Patan, Gujarat, said that i am a Shiva devotee, and always believe in the truth
 bijepi jo bhi bole main sachai main hi vishwaas karata hum
 Janaudhari is not just a Hindu, the Congress is an attacker on the BJP only after Rahulism
 congress netaa randeep surajevaala ne press conference kar kaha tha ki bijepi raajnneeti ke str ko gira rahi he
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that Rahul is not just a Hindu but a Jainudhari Hindu
 bijepi ke kisi ke haath main kuch nahin he
 Everything is in the hands of Modi and Shah
 bijepi ne kaise uthaaya muddajise hi rahul gandhi ke gaiyr-hindu register main sin karne kii khabar ai, bijepi puri tarah se hamalavar ho gai
 bjp's IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted, Rahul declared himself non-hindu
 agar ye sach he to vah baar-baar vah mandir kyon ja rahe hai
 Significantly, the election dates are near and the attitude of both the parties is visible
 usase lagata he ki ye mudda abhi or bhi jor pakadega or chunaav prachaar main goonjata sunai degaa
 Let us tell you that there will be elections in two phases in Gujarat, first phase on December 9 and second phase on December 14
 chunaav ke nattejey himachal pradesh ke nateezon ke saath hi 18 disambar ko hi aaenge

 The impact of the recent hurricanes in America may also affect your pocket
 darasal vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki america main aae tufaanon se tel ke utpaadan par puri duniya main asar pada he or petrol keemten badhane kii ek vajah ye bhi he
 Jaitley says that its impact will end soon and prices may get some relief in the coming days
 lekin vipakshi partiyon or shivasena or jediu jaise sahyogi dalon ke dabaav ke baavjood arun jetali ne tex kam karke tel kii keemton main raahat dene ke vichaar ko khaarij kar diya
 Let me tell you how many opposition parties say that the oil prices are constantly increasing due to the continuous increase in excise duty on petroleum
 vipakshi partiyon ke is aarope ko lekar jetali ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ko tamaam yojanaon ko chalaane ke liye rupee kii jarurat he
 Jaitley said that from all the schemes of social welfare to build highways, rupees are needed and the government is using the earnings from oil in it
 jetali ne ulta ye sawaal kiya ki congress or sipiem jaisi jo partiyaan tel par centre sarkaar ke tex par sawaal uthaa rahi he wo khud kyon nahin waite kar karke logon ko raahat de detii hai
 Jaitley also said that 42 per cent of the tax collected by the central government on petroleum is given to the states, so the states can give relief at their own level if they want

 Pakistan on Thursday denied any agreement with India in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav
 pakistan kii taraf se kaha gaya ki isije ke faisle ko lagu karne ko lekar samvidhan ke anusaar hi koi kadam uthaaya jayega
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal's remarks came a day after the Pakistan Army said that the government was looking into various legal options to review Jadhav's case
 bhartiya nausena ke sevanivruth adhikari jadhav (49) ko pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat ne band kamare main hui sunwaayee ke baad april 2017 main jasusi or aatankwaad ke aaropon main maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 In this case, India has been saying that Jadhav was abducted from Iran
 nausena se sevanivruth hone ke baad kaarobaari hiton ke chalate ve yahaan the
 On July 17, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Pakistan must review the death sentence awarded to Jadhav
 ise bharat kii ek badi jeet ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 Faisal said at the weekly briefing here, 'there will be no compromise
 
 
 saare nirnay sthaneey kanoonon ke anusaar hi liye jaaenge
 He said that any step to implement the decision of ICJ will be taken as per the constitution itself
 antarashtriya nyaayalay main jadhav kii sunwaayee ke dauraan bharat ne daleel di thi ki vienna sandhi kaa ulanghan kar uske naagarik ko rajanyik pahunch se vanchit rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Rejecting Pakistan's objection to India's acceptance of the application in this case, the ICJ said in its 42-page order that continued adjournment on the execution of the death sentence creates the unavoidable position to review Jadhav's penalty
 jadhav ko sunaae gaye dand se donon padosi deshon main tanaav paidaa ho gaya he
 The ICJ, however, rejected many of India's demands, including the release of the military court's decision, its release
 pakistan ne kaaphi taal-matol ke baad isije ke nirdesh ke tahat do sitambar ko jadhav ko rajanyik pahunch pradaan kii thi

 a post shared by Deepika Padukone (@deepikapadukone) on Jun 29, 2018 at 7:56 am PDTA post shared by Deepika Padukone (@deepikapadukone) on Jul 21, 2018 at 9:34 pm PDT bacchon ko bada karnaa bahut mushkil kaam he
 Given this, people rarely think of having a second child, but these days, many people are thinking of another child after seeing Kate Middleton and Kim Kardashian
 doosraa baccha plan karne se pehle kai baton kaa dhyaan rakhana bahut jaruri he, kyonki ham na to royal parivaar se hai or na hi celibrity jo bacchon ko dekhne ke liye ghar main kai aayaa ho
 So if you too are thinking about another child, then pay attention to these things: 1
 doosraa baccha plan karne se pehle is baat kaa jarur dhyaan rakhen ki pehla baccha kitna bada hua he
 If the first child is too young then it may become a problem for you to plan the second child
 2
 It is very important to have a difference of at least three to five years between the first and second child
 isse donon bachche ek duusare ko samaj paaenge
 3
 duusare bachche kaa matlab he apane kharchon ko badhanaa
 So before planning another child, also understand how ready you are to take up new responsibilities
 4
 It is very important to be physically strong, because the second child means more running, more work and being fit for it is very important
 5
 Time management is also important for the second baby, just like the other factor
 agar aap naukari karti hai, baccha dekhati hai or ghar sambhalati hai to aapke liye ye sab thodaa or mushkil ho jayega
 Second child means six months' leave from office
 agar aapaki naukari main ye lambii chuttee kii dikkat he to doosraa baccha plan karnaa thodaa mushkil kaam he
 6
 agar pehla baccha special child he to doosraa baccha laana bahut samajhadaari nahin he, kyonki pehle bachche ko aapaki zyada jarurat he
 7
 pregnent hone se pehle ye soch len ki agar aapako smoking, drinking karnaa bahut pasand he, party karnaa pasand he, baahar khaanaa pasand he yaa kuch khaas kism ke kapad pasand he to ye sab lambey samay ke liye chhot jayega
 If you are ready for all these, then plan another child
 8
 If your partner is also fully prepared for the second child, then plan another child, because it will require the support of the same

 Manmohan Singh and former Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Raghuram Rajan as responsible for the 'worst phase' of public sector banks
 samachar agency press trust of india ke mutabik, columbia uniwarsity ke skool of international and public afares main mangalvaar ko vittamantri ne kaha, "mujhe is baat main koi andeh nahin he ki rajan jo kuch bhi kehete hai, vahi mahasoos karte hai
 
 
 And today, while giving full respect to them here, i want to put this truth in front of you that the Indian public sector banks have never seen a worse time than when the pair of Singh and Rajan were working as Prime Minister and RBI Governor
 
 
 
 us vakt, hamamen se kisi ko bhi us bare main pataa nahin tha
 
 
 "according to the RBI, the non-performing assets (NPA or bad loans) of public sector banks stood at Rs 9,190 crore in the year 2011-2012, which increased to 2 in the year 2013-2014

 During the lecture organized by the Deepak and Neera Raj Center on Indian Economic Policies at the University of New York, the Union Finance Minister said, "
 
 
 main ek mahaan scollar ke taur par raghuram rajan kaa sammaan karti hum, jinhone us vakt bhartiya kendriya bank main kaam karnaa kabool kiya, jab bhartiya arthvyavastha oochaal par thi
 
 
 "nirmala Sitharaman was replying to a question asked by the audience about Raghuram Rajan's recent statement during his lecture - only internal engagement and economic growth will strengthen India's national security and not majoritarianism
 is bayaan kaa nishaanaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ko mana ja rahaa he
 O
 on 9 October at Brown University's Watson Institute
 pi
 Raghuram Rajan in the Jindal Lecture stated, "in the long run, i think, internal engagement and economic growth will strengthen the roots of India's national security in place of the divisive, and populist majoritarianism
" 
 
 so, is tarah kaa bahusankhyakwaad kuch vakt tak chunaav to jita saktaa he, lekin yah bharat ko andhere, anishchit raste par le ja rahaa he
 
 
 "reiterating one of the sentences used by BJP in election speeches to criticize both economists (dr
 Manmohan Singh and Raghuram Rajan)," the finance minister said, "rajan's time as RBI governor was only for the leaders These loans were given on the basis of phone calls, and public sector banks in India are waiting for the government to invest to get out of that quagmire
 
 
 "vittamantri ne kaha, "dow manmohan singh pradhanmantri the, or mujhe bharosa he ki dow rajan sahamat honge ki dow singh ke paas bharat ko lekar satat sochaa-samajha vijan hoga
 
 
 "she also said that though she would like to thank Raghuram Rajan for ordering the asset quality review of public sector banks

 After all, the Prime Minister is the leader among equals in any cabinet
 
 
 bharat jaise vividhtaon se bhare desh kaa netritv prabhavi hona hi chahie
 
 
 a more democratic leadership might get praise from liberals, but that leaves behind the filth of corruption that we are cleaning up till today

 In the last three years, the Bihar unit of the BJP has implemented the idea of the organization that Shah kept in the state after the party's defeat in 2015

 a heartbreaking case has come to light in Pune, Maharashtra
 jahaan ek shaks ne do saal kii maasoom bacchee kaa apharan kar liya
 He was then brutally beaten to death
 lekin aspatal le jate vakt uski maut ho gai
 Police is calling it a case of enmity
 jabaki peedit mata-pita kaa kahana he ki police tathyon ko galat tareeke se pesh kar rahi he
 Neighbors of the victim's family have also come out in their support
 police ne jab soochna milane par bacchee ko baraamad kiya to uske sharir par choton ke saath-saath tej daant se kaatane ke nishaan bhi mili
 The victim also had a serious head injury
 police kaa daawa he ki balaatkaar kaa koi sanket nahin mila he
 The post-mortem report has not come yet
 police kaa daawa he ki hamale ke peeche sirf badla makasad tha, jabaki peedit mata-pita kaa kahana he ki police unhen gumraah kar rahi he
 Because the person arrested by the police as an accused
 use peedita parivaar jaanata tak nahin to unki dushmani kaise ho sakati he
 Neighbors of the victim's family say that two unsuccessful attempts were made to raise young girls in the last two months
 is vaardaat main bhi aaropee ne bacchee ko us vakt agava kiya, jab vah shouch ke liye baahar gai thi
 The accused took the girl to a railway compartment standing in the Pune railway yard and attacked her brutally
 haalanki ab aaropee ke bayanon main virodhabhas he
 Therefore, questions are being raised on the investigation of the police
 beeti 26 agast kii subah, railway yard kshetra main gasht kar rahe arpeef ke javaanon ko bacchee rail ke dibbe main gambhir rup se ghayal avasthaa main mili thi
 There was bleeding from his body
 bacchee ko turant sasoon sarkari aspataal le jaaya gaya
 But he died on the way
 is sambandh main police stesan main apharan, shaareerik hamalaa or hatya kaa maamla darj kiya he
 DCP Zone 2 Shirish Sardeshpande told Aaj Tak that three teams have been formed to resolve the matter
 railway plateform par maujuud logon se poochtacha ke alaava, pune railway stesan par sabhi sambhav sisitivi camaron kii footage dekhi gai he
 At present, the police has arrested a 19-year-old youth in this case
 police ne daawa kiya he ki aaropee ne poochtacha ke dauraan is ghatana main shaamil hona sweekaar kiya he
 In his statement to the police, the accused said that he wanted to take revenge on the girl's parents
 kyonki unhone use peeta tha
 Surprisingly, the victim family claims that even if they do not know the accused, there is no point in beating or enmity with him
 peedit parivaar ke padosiyon kaa kahana he ki balika ke apharan kii yah pehali ghatana nahin he
 Earlier too, there were two such attempts
 lekin logon ke shor machaane par aparankartaaon ne us bacchee ko chhod diya tha
 Due to this incident, there is an atmosphere of panic in the area about children
 kendriya food processing mantri harsimrat cor badal ne bijepi chhodkar aam aam party main jane kii taiyaari kar rahe navjot singh siddhu par hamalaa bolaa he
 Badal said in a special conversation from till today that Sidhu is opportunistic and he cannot belong to anyone
 navjot singh siddhu ne rajyasabha se istipha diya he or aam aadmi party main jane kii khabaren hai
 How do you see it? Harsimrat Kaur: See, this discussion is not a new thing
 main kahati hum yah diwaar main saaf likhaa hua tha
 Their conversation was going on for a long time
 yah sab jaanate hai
 The rhetoric that these families were doing was getting a clear indication of what they were about to do
 balki haftaa pehle hi jabaki puure punjab main itnaa rosh tha har aadmi ne ninda kii ki aam aadmi party apane menifesto kii tulana guru granth sahab gita se quran se sabase kii
 There was so much anger among all the people that even the common man party accepted his mistake
 siddhu kii patni se yah poocha gaya ki kya aapako isamen galat lagata he to unhone saaf kah diya ki isamen koi galat baat he hi nahin
 So any Sikh who compares his manifesto to Guru Granth Sahib does not get anything wrong
 to mere khyaal se kya setting hui hui thi ki inako ko itnaa jhukna padaa
 The signs were clear
 yah to queshchan of time tha
 Voter by taking what you can take from BJP
 duusari party se use jo acha le sakate hai le len
 There will be some zero effect on the ground
 aam aadmi party siddhu ko siem candidet ke rup main project kar sakati he to iskaa kitna asar dikhaai degaa?harsimrat cor:main to aam aadmi party ko chalange karti hum ki inkaa elaan to karen
 Even before the announcement, you will be seen in the Aam Aadmi Party that they have promised this post to a dozen people
 kisko denge yah kisi ko nahin pataa kyonki aadhaar to kisi kaa he nahin
 This party belongs to opportunists who have no ideology
 yah party to karpshan ke khilaaf ai thi
 Told people what they wanted to hear
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad unka mukhyamantri kabhi pradhanmantri ke chunaav ladane ke liye bhaag jaataa he kahin kabhi kahin bhaag jaataa he
 The party which has no ideology and the ideology that came on, does not have an ideology
 jo apni partiyon se nikaale gaye hai or jinako logon ne nakaar diya he, aise logon is party main ikatthe ho rahe hai
 This is a party of all opportunists and another opportunist is joining this party
 unako mubarak ho
 It is also being said that Kissiddhu was angry with the Akalis and from the clouds
 unki patni kaa kahana he ki unako andekha kiya gaya, fund nahin diya gaya?harsimrat cor:ye donon sabhi se naaraaz rahe hai
 If i were from the Akali Dal, i could understand
 ye donon sabase pehle to apni party se naaraaz hai
 His wife was not made up of anyone in his party, the minister whose wife has worked under him, even though he was a minister, did not join him
 hamase to kya banani thi
 The godfather of Sidhu Saheb, who saved him from jail, gave him the ticket of MP, who won him, when he could not be made, then who would become him
 jis party ne unako teen baar saansad banaaya, ve unke sage nahin hue
 Basicly the problem is to keep this couple with someone
 inako mubarak jis party main jaaen
 This will not affect the alliance of BJP and Akali
 main to kahati hum aam aadmi party inhen lekar jald se jald elaan kare
 Sidhu also does TV programs like Comedy Nights
 aapako lagata he isse unki lokapriyata main kuch phayda hoga?harsimrat cor:aam aadmi party izkamedioff era
 i consider it appropriate to go to that party because there are already a lot of clown comedy-related professionals in it
 bhagwant maan saansad hai
 Even if there are ghungis from Punjab
 ye saare kamedian ikatthe ho rahe hai
 People also need a party to entertain
 kejariwal ji iske prati jo kuch kar rahe hai main unka shukriya adaa karti hum ki punjab kaa maahaul halkaa-phulka karne main logon ko acchhee-acchhee baaten sunaane ke liye ye aise logon ko ikattha kar rahe hai
 Good thing it will be Election Entertainment

 Former Governor of the Reserve Bank
 ve
 Reddy, refusing to forecast the GDP growth for the current year in view of the setback to the economy due to steps like GST and demonetisation, said that the economy needs two years to fully recover from this situation and move on to the path of high growth
 Time is needed more
 unhone kaha ki is samay aarthik vruddhi ko lekar koi anumaan lagaana kaaphi mushkil kaam he, yaa phir yah kahana ki arthvyavastha phir se 7
 When will it return to the path of possible high growth of 5 to 8 percent
 baharhaal, yah sthiti agle 24 maheene yani 2 saal ke dauraan banati nahin dikhaai detii he
 In response to questions from a group of reporters, Reddy said it was a setback that started with a positive perception
 isamen kuch sudhaar aa saktaa he or uske baad kuch phayda mil saktaa he
 Right now there is problem in this and the profit will come later
 kitna phayda hoga or kitne antaraal ke baad yah hoga yah dekhne kii baat he
 The former governor of the central bank said that my guess is that it may take a few years
 kuch saal main ham phir se 7
 5- 8 percent can reach the target of increasing
 unhone kaha is jatke se jo pareshaani khadi hui thi vah kam ho rahi he jabaki sakaaratmak maahaul bananaa abhi baaki he
 i hope that this atmosphere will come
 reddy ne kaha kiarthvyavastaako teen saal tak ek prakaar kaa sakaaratmak jhatka kachche tel ke daam main baari giravat ke rup main mila he
 Crude oil prices in the overseas market remained surprisingly low for three consecutive years
 unhone yaad kiya ki jab vah governor the uske mukaable pichley teen saal main kachche tel ke daam ek tihaai par aa gaye the
 However, in the meantime, economic growth was affected due to the implementation of GST, demonetisation and huge non-performing funds of banks
 unhone kaha ki ucch vruddhi ke dauraan pichhali sarkaar main bina soch vichaar ke die gaye karj or bhrashtachar ke arapon ko lekar doorsanchaar or koyala kshetra main ghate ghatnakram se company kshetra par kaaphi dabaav bad gaya
 Due to this development, the debt implicated in the banking system was increased by 15 percent
 27 july, shuukravaar ko 21veen sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan hone vaala he
 This lunar eclipse has been named 'blood Moon'
 vigyaan prasar ke senior khagolvid arvind ranade ne aaj tak ke saath ek khaas baatcheet ke dauraan bataaya he ki 27 july hone vaala chandragrahan 21veen sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan hoga
 In this, the position of full moon eclipse will remain for 103 minutes
 unhone bataaya ki is saal kaa pehla chandragrahan janvari ke maheene main padaa tha, lekin 27 july ko hone vaala chandragrahan isse kahin zyada prabhaavshaalee hoga
 This is the specialty of the full lunar eclipse, Aurovind Ranade has also told that this is an important astronomical event
 jab chandramaa prithvi kii sabase andheri yaa kaali chaaya se gujarata he to wo sabase lambey samay tak rahane vaala chandragrahan hota he
 The lunar eclipse on July 27 and 28 will pass through the darkest shadow of the Earth, due to which it is considered to be the longest lunar eclipse of the century
 chandragrahan 27 july ko, jaane sutak kaa samayiske alaava unhone bataaya ki bharat ke alaava yah chandragrahan africa, dakshin asia, australia or dakshin america se dikhaai degaa
 But in India, this lunar eclipse will be seen from beginning to end
 arvind ranade ne ye bhi bataaya he ki, chandragrahan bhartiya samay ke anusaar 27 july kii raat 11 bajkar 54 minute se shuru hoga
 Gradually, the shadow of the Earth will start falling on the moon
 28 july der raat 1 baje ke kareeb prithvi kii chaaya se chand puri tarah se dhak jayega
 At around 3
49 pm, the moon will come out of the earth's shadow
 28 july lagbhag 5 baje ke kareeb chandramaa puri tarah se prithvi kii viral chaaya se baahar nikal jayega
 Scientific importance of lunar eclipse Arvind Ranade said that in today's time, the lunar eclipse has not been of much scientific importance, but in the history, the shape of the Earth has been confirmed only due to the shadow of the lunar eclipse
 chandragrahan ke kaaran hi prithvi ke bare main kai tarah kii jaankaree praapt hui he
 The longest lunar eclipse of the century, there are predictions of destruction in the Bible! Explaining the difference between lunar eclipse and solar eclipse, he said that the moon's shadow falls on the earth during solar eclipse, while the earth's shadow at the lunar eclipse
 It falls
 prithvi kii chaaya chandramaa kii chaaya se bahut zyada badi hoti he, jis kaaran surya grahan ke mukaable chandragrahan zyada lambey samay tak rahata he

 The woman claimed that she was 19 years old when Pachouri was harassed by her
 uskaa paksh grover or ek or vakil ratna aapnender rakhengi
 Pachauri refused to speak on the allegations
 Pachauri refused to comment on these allegations
 haalanki, unke vakil ashish dikshit ne ise apane muvakkil ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh qaraar diya he
 He says that every time such a case comes, why does Grover only give a statement and there is no police complaint
 unke mutabik, jajon kii purvadharna banane ke liye is tarah kii khabaren failaai jaati hai
 After the Karnataka assembly elections, these days a woman is getting very trend on the internet

 gagan shaadishuda hai lekin uski garlfriend bindu (digangana suryavanshi )he or bindu khud bhi shaadishuda he
 When Rajiv arrives at Gagan Kapoor's house on Friday, there are many ups and downs in the story
 vaise film ke aakhir main kai dilachasp ghatnaayen ghatati hai, jinhen jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Why you can see the film? The story of the film is similar to the typical Govinda films
 abhishek dogra kaa diarection badhiya he
 Manu Rishi Chadha has written powerful dialogues
 kai baar to aise pal bhi aate hai jab aap bahut jor se thahaake markar hansate hai or hansate-hansate ankhon main pani bhi aa saktaa he

 Other top leaders of the Grand Alliance are also likely to be present in this rally
 haalanki aisi khabaren bhi hai ki lalu is raily main shaamil nahin ho or apane chote bete tejasvi ko bhejein
 The party believes that addressing the rally on the topic of 'equality and harmony' by RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will give the message of social justice with greater effect by the anti-bjp alliance

 vipaksh ke anusaar vah adhyadesh argedy pramukh kii madad ke liye laayaa gaya tha jinhen chaara ghotaale main doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 Asked whether Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar would share the dais with Rahul Gandhi at the September 19 rally, JDU General Secretary KC Tyagi said, "nitish ji is joining the rally
" rajd kii ore se koun aaenge, yah us party ko tay karnaa he, lekin kisi kaa sonia gandhi yaa rahul gandhi ke saath koi mudda nahin he

 After this, chant at least 3 or more than 11 malas of any mantra of Lord Shiva
 jap ke pashchaat bhagwaan shiv kaa dhyaan karen
 Lastly, take the name of Dwadash Jyotirlingas and then pray for forgiveness

 Deepak Sawant and Arif had no idea that the one they were trying to cheat was actually a policeman associated with Belgaum Crime Branch
 unhone jaise hi kaagaj ke tukdon ko khaas chemical se saaf kar hajaar rupee ke note dikhaae to unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The comments belgaum ke disipi krime anupam agarwal ne bataaya ki aisi dhokhadhadi kii khabaren police ko lagaataar mil rahi thim
 In such a situation, the police traps this gang
 deepak saavant apane saathi aarif kii madad se bhole-bhaale graminon ko apane jaal main fansaata tha
 The formula used to be old i
e
 take one thousand two, five thousand
 pehle ye donon thag choti rakam lete
 Then wash the real currency notes dyed black with a special kind of chemical
 saafe hote hi un nots ko apane shikaar ko tham dete or kehete ki jaanch kar lo
 Since those notes were real, there was no difficulty in playing them
 baad main jab log badi rakam lekar inke paas aate to ye unke badale kaale rang main range kaagaj ke bandal thama kar bhaag lete the
 The police had received many complaints of such fraud
 police isliye pareshaan he kyonki thagi kaa taqariban do dashak purana yah tarika nigeria ke log apanaate the or unke shikaar hai socity ke log ho rahe the
 This trick of cheating is known as black dollar scam or wash-wash scam
 ab tak antarrashtriya str par arabon rupee is tareeke se thage ja chuke hai, lekin gramin ilaakon main isaki paith kii shaayad ye pehali misaal he
 Anupam Aggarwal, DCP Crime of Belgaum, said that reports of such fraud were being received continuously by the police
 aise main police ne is giroh ko trep kiya
 Deepak Sawant, with the help of his partner Arif, implicated innocent villagers in his web
 formula purana hi hota tha yani ek hajaar do, paanch hajaar lo
 Earlier both these thugs would take small amount
 phir kaale rang se range asli karency nots ko ek khaas tarah ke rasayan se dhote
 On clearing those notes, the victim would stop and say check it out
 chunki ve nots asli hote the, aise main unhen chalaane main koi mushkil nahin hoti thi
 Later, when people came to them with a large amount of money, they used to participate by handing them bundles of paper dyed in black
 aisi thagi kii kai shikaayat police ko mili thi
 The police are upset because the people of Nigeria were adopting this almost two-decade-old method of cheating and they were being victimized by the High Society
 thagi ke is tathike ko blike dollar scam yaa vaash-vaash scam ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Till now, billions of rupees have been cheated internationally, but this is probably the first example of its penetration in rural areas

 yah sawaal ab jor pakad rahaa he ki bhartiya cricket team kaa bos koun he
 After the team's humiliating defeat at the hands of England, the BCCI sent former captain Ravi Shastri there so that the situation would be brought under control but nothing is clear at the moment
 board ne ravi shastri ko saare adhikaar dekar england bheja or kaha ki vah saare faisle lene ke liye adhikrut hai
 But Shastri clearly said in an interview that Dhoni is the leader of the team and he will decide everything
 udhar, dhoni ne apane coach dancan flechar ko aage badha diya or kaha ki vah bos hai or world cap tak team kii koching karenge
 Now the question is arising that who is the real boss of the team, Shastri, Dhoni or Fletcher? a new twist has also come in this matter
 dhoni ke bayaan ke baad bisisiai ne naaraazgi jataai he or kaha he ki board kii agali baithak main dhoni ke bayaan par vichaar hoga
 But it is well known that it is not anyone's duty to take any step against the Indian cricket captain and there is no option for the post of captain except Dhoni
 dhoni kii baaten bisisiai ko manani hi padegi
 Even though the board is saying that Shastri has gone there to find out the defeat of the Indian team and will show the steps to improve it
 lekin baat saaf he ki shastri vahaan kuch kar nahin sakate kyonki team ke saare top batsman flop ho chuke hai
 It seems that the top officials of Dhoni and BCCI are not getting tracked
 dhoni hameshaa kii tarah apane dhang se kaam kar rahe hai
 The BCCI now wants Dhoni to follow the directions of Shastri
 lekin aisa hota nahin lagata he
 Dhoni is still giving importance to Fletcher
 sach to yah he ki antarrashtriya str ke khilaadiyon ko koi bhi coach kuch khaas samajha nahin saktaa
 They can be told about their mistakes or about their shortcomings
 lekin jab khilaadi kuch samaj hi na paa rahaa ho jaisaa england main ho rahaa he to coach kya kar saktaa he?ab sabhi kii nigahen agle van de par he
 If the Indian team performs well then all the controversies will end
 agar team jitati he to dhoni, flechar or shastri kii jai-jayakaar ho jaaegi
 Anyway, England team is not considered a very good team in One Day
 england ke purv captain kevin petersan ne kaha ki bhartiya cricket team ke videshon main paraajay kaa kaaran yah he ki ab bhartiya english county cricket nahin khelte hai
 By playing county cricket, both batsmen and bowlers are familiar with the technology there
 yah jaruri he
 Earlier every Indian player used to play there and that would improve their game

 com / 8abp0xj4zj The winter session of Parliament began on a tumultuous Thursday
 bahu-brands khudara main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) or pronnati main daliton tathaa janajatiyon ke liye aarakshan ke mudde par hangaame ke kaaran rajyasabha or loksabhaa kii kaarywahi baadhit hui
 Amid this noise, the Trinamool Congress' vote of no confidence did not get enough support from the opposition mps in the Lok Sabha and was rejected
 trinmul pramukh or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or vampanthi partiyon kii khudara vyapaar main pratyaksh videshi nivesh par unke avishvaas prastaav kaa samarthan nahin karne ke liye aalochana kii
 Minutes before the winter session began, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the government wanted to discuss all the issues in Parliament and cooperate with all parties in the smooth conduct of the session
 vaise unki is apil par vipaksh ne koi dhyaan nahin diya
 Singh hoped that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha members will discuss the issues and challenges facing the country in a united manner
 unhone kaha, "ham donon sadanon main sabhi muddon par charchaa ke liye taiyaar hai
 " bhaajapa or marxvaadi communist party (makapa) donon ne loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar se anurodh kiya ki unki us notice par matdaan karaae, jisamen unhone bahu-brands khudara main videshi nivesh kaa virodh kiya he
 Kumar said that the notice is being considered
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki vah khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) par sabhi partiyon kii salaah lene ke vaade se mukar rahi hai
 The government denied the charge
 vaanijya mantri anand sharma ne kaha, "hamane is vaade ko nahin todaa he
 " bhaajapa ne unke khilaaf rajya sabha main epadiai mudde par unke vaade par visheshadhikaar hanan notice diya tha
 The Trinamool's no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha was supported only by four Biju Janata Dal mps, who left the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in September on the issue of economic reform
 samprag kaa samarthan karne vaali mulaayam singh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ne bhi khudara kshetra main epadiai par sarkaar kaa virodh kiya lekin kaha ki loksabhaa kii adhyaksh tay karengi ki kis niyam ke tahat is par bahes hogi
 According to government sources, the debate can be accepted without provision for voting
 sutara ke mutabik chunki yah vittiya maamla nahin he, isliye yadi sarkaar epadiai par matdaan main haar bhi jaati he, to bhi iske saamne koi khatra nahin he
 The Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned four times before the first day session was adjourned at 2 pm
 rajya sabha main bhi baari bahes hui, lekin ek atirikt mudde par
 Earlier, members of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party gathered in front of the Speaker
 samaajawaadee party ne jahaan rasoi gas mulya vruddhi main vaapasi kii maang kii, vahiin basapa ne uttarapradesh main kanoon or vyavastha kii samasya uthaai
 The comments basapa kii pramukh mayawati ne kaha ki unki party ne sarkari naukariyon main daliton or janajatiyon ko pronnati sunishchit karne ke liye sarkaar dwaara kanoon nahin laae jane par rajya sabha kii prakriya baadhit kii
 It was adjourned for the day due to frequent disruptions of proceedings
 sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr 20 disambar ko samaapt hoga jabaki isamen keval 16 kaamkaaji din honge
 In this session, 25 Bills will be passed and 10 Bills will be introduced
 is shor sharabe ke bich trinmul congress ke avashvis prastaav ko loksabhaa main vipakshi saansadon kaa samuchit samarthan nahin mil paaya or ise khaarij kar diya gaya
 Trinamool chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left parties for not supporting their no-confidence motion on foreign direct investment in retail trade
 sheetakaaleen satr shuru hone se kuch minute pehle pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki sarkaar sansad main sabhi muddon par charchaa karnaa chaahati he or satr ke sucharu sanchaalan main sabhi partiyon kaa sahyog chaahati he
 However, the opposition did not pay any attention to his appeal
 singh ne ummid jataai ki rajyasabha va loksabhaa sadsy desh ke saamne maujuud muddon va chunautiyon par ekajute hokar charchaa karenge
 He said, "we are ready to discuss all the issues in both the houses
" " Both the BJP and the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) requested Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar to vote on his notice, in which he opposed foreign investment in multi-brand retail
 kumaar ne kaha ki notice par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj accused the government of reneging on the promise of seeking advice from all parties on foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail
 sarkaar ne is aarope ko khaarij kiya
 Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said, "we have not broken this promise
 " The BJP had given a breach of privilege notice against him on his promise on the FDI issue in the Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main trinmul ke avishvaas prastaav ko sirf biju janata dal ke chaar saansadon kaa hi samarthan mila, jinhone sitambar main aarthik sudhaar ke mudde par sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ko chhod diya tha
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party, which supports the UPA, also opposed the government on FDI in retail but said that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha will decide under which rules it will be debated
 sarkari sutron ke mutabik bina matdaan ke praavdhaan ke bahes ko manjuur kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the source, since it is not a financial matter, even if the government loses in voting on FDI, there is no danger in front of it
 dopaher do baje pehle din ke satr ko sthagit kiye jane se pehle loksabhaa kii kaarywahi ko chaar baar sthagit kiya gaya
 There was heavy debate in the Rajya Sabha, but on an additional issue
 isse pehle samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke sadsy adhyaksh ke asana ke saamne jamaa ho gaye

 He said, "we are ready to discuss all the issues in both the houses

 sarkaar ne is aarope ko khaarij kiya
 Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said, "we have not broken this promise

 Minutes before the winter session began, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the government wanted to discuss all the issues in Parliament and cooperate with all parties in the smooth conduct of the session
 vaise unki is apil par vipaksh ne koi dhyaan nahin diya
 Singh hoped that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha members will discuss the issues and challenges facing the country in a united manner

 " bhaajapa ne unke khilaaf rajya sabha main epadiai mudde par unke vaade par visheshadhikaar hanan notice diya tha
 The Trinamool's no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha was supported only by four Biju Janata Dal mps, who left the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in September on the issue of economic reform

 Justice J
, who was a judge in the Supreme Court
 chelmeshwar ne india today conklev 2019 ke manch par rajdeep saradesai ke sawaalon kaa bebaaki se jawaab diya
 During this time, when Rajdeep asked him if the judges are compromising, he said that it depends on the person, which judge are you referring to? However, i can say that there are some judges who can be bowed down
 lekin sabhi jajon ko ek hi najar se dekhnaa sahi nahin he
 On the second day of India Today Conclave 2019, Justice J
 chelmeshwar ne kaha ki loktantr main sawaal poochna koi virodh nahin hota
 Rajdeep asked that the judges never had a press conference against the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Deepak Mishra
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue chelmeshwar ne kaha ki agar kuch kabhi nahin hua iskaa matlab ye nahin ki kabhi nahin hoga
 Even when we held the press conference, it was said that this is something new
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki sirf bharat hi nahin balki duniya main bhi nyaaypalika main sankat aata rahaa he
 In such a situation, questions have also been raised about the judges, but not all the judges can be seen from one perspective
 unhone kaha ki jab maine sawaal uthaae to kuch logon ne kaha ki main koi agenda chalaa rahaa hum
 But i do not mind
 chelmeshver ne kaha ki mahabhiyog laana kisi bhi samasya kaa hal nahin he
 Collegium systems also have problems
 court ke dwaara kii ja rahi niyuktiyon ko roka ja rah tha
 However, he said that there was a dispute over the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court in the past
 log seniurity kii baat kar rahe the, lekin kisi ne jajon ke faislon kii baat nahin kii
 In such a situation, people should also see what kind of thoughts the judge thinks

 Sangma's tribal card did not work
 ab iske sahare ve adivasee bahul rajya chhattisgarh kii raajnneeti main sakriyata badhaane kii koshish main hai
 The tribals of the state are disappointed as the state government's decision to increase their reservation from 28 to 32 per cent has been stayed by the Bilaspur High Court
 congress se is varg kaa mohabhang pehle hi ho chukaa he
 Tribal votes are important in the state as 27 out of 90 assembly seats are reserved for tribals
 9 agast ko vishwa adivasee diwas par raipur main yojit ek sammelan main pahunche sangama ne adivasee party banane kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha, ''yahaan ke majboot janaadhar vaale adivasee netaaon ko netritv jaan-boojhkar nahin saunpa gaya
 "in the last one month, Sangma has done more than five visits to Chhattisgarh
" sangama adivasee mukhyamantri dene kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 He may also get the support of tribal leaders in Congress including Arvind Netam, bjp's tribal leader Nandkumar Sai and other tribal leaders of the state
 lekin pradesh congress ikai ke adhyaksh nand kumaar patel kehete hai, ''adivaasiyon ke liye sangama ne kuch nahin kiya
 "so according to BJP state president Ram Sewak Packra," Sangma's party does not seem to have a political existence
 '' Another trick of Pakistan is revealed
 pakistan kii khufia agency iesai or paak ke hukmran bharat ke mahatvapurn ang paak adhikrut kashmir (pioke) main afgaan rifuji ko basaane main jute hai
 a major security report has revealed this
 sutron ne 'ajtak' ko jaankaree di he ki kareeb 2500 se zyada afghanistan rifuji pioke ke kotli jile main bas rahe hai
 According to information from sources, 1438 of these Afghanistan refugees have been quietly settled across the Pak loc
 bhartiya suraksha agenciyaan lagaataar bas rahe afgaan sharnaarthiyon par najar rakhe hue hai kyonki jo sharnaarthi yahaan aa rahe hai, ve bharat ke liye khatra ho sakate hai
 Earlier, Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI was trying to get these Afghan refugees into terrorist work
 sutron ne 'aaj tak' ko yah jaankaree di he ki pakistan kii jelon main band afgaan talibani logon ko pakistan is shart par chhodane ke liye taiyaar tha ki ve kashmir main jaakar jehad karenge
 Let me tell you that this is the same Pakistan who had made a complete plan to expel Afghan refugees from their country
 peshawar hamale ke baad pakistan ko yah lagane laga tha ki sharnaarthi pakistan main rahenge to aise hi talibani hamale hote rahenge
 Now Pakistan is following the way that Afghan refugees who were beheaded for them can be instigated against India by settling in pok
 sutara bataate hai ki afgaan sharnaarthi kuch aise hai jinamein kai talibani gut ko bhi samarthan dete hai
 These groups are also ready to wage jihad against India
 lihaaja pioke main afgaan rifuji kaa basna suraksha ke lihaaj se chintaa kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Pakistan has been doing this by sending terrorists to India by training, running training camps in pok, raising funds for terror and sheltering terrorists
 ab pakistan kii khufia agency iesai un aatanki guton ko kashmir main tabaahi machaane ke liye taiyaar kar rahi he jo uski jelon main band hai
 Pakistan has asked to release tehreek-e-taliban militants in their jails on the condition that they will go to Kashmir Valley and fight in the name of Jihad
 khufia report ke mutabik, iesai ne in kaidiyon ko jaish-e-mohammad ke binar tale jehad karne ke liye taiyaar kiya he
 The tehreek-e-taliban (pakistan) is the same terrorist organization that carried out a suicide attack in 2014 at the Army School in Peshawar
 isamen 126 bacchon kii maut ho gai thi

 There are about 1,200 nurses working in Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, who are being trained in self-defense

 Mamta Pandya, who has been working in the hospital for the past several years, says that this training was very important for her as most of the women are staff in the hospital, sometimes the relatives of the patient also misbehave with us
 ham logon kii nite shift main bhi duty lagati he, is lihaaj se aate jate vakt yah training hamaare kaam aegi
 The training has been organized by the hospital administration itself

 This training can prove beneficial for them all the time

 The matter is in the city of Birmingham, UK, where a British Muslim girl stands in front of the radical group English Defense League (EDL), smiling with great courage and this picture is now going viral
 aage badhane se pehle bataa den ki haal hi main hue westoministar hamale ke baad EDL 'islamic aatankwaad' ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan karne sadak par utraa
 Then something happened that a picture of British Muslim Safiya Khan was taken which has now gone viral
 darasal pradarshnakariyon ne virodh ke dauraan ek hijaab pahani mahila ko gher liya or islam virdohi naare lagane lage
 Safiya saw this view from a distance and she reached the spot and stood in defense of the woman

 Her being there was a coincidence but when she saw EDL protesters surrounding the woman, she could not resist herself
 safia ne bataaya ki mahila kaa bachaav karne ke baad virodh karne waalon ne unhen gher liya lekin vah bilkul nahin darin
 Rather, when Safiya started shouting loudly, she put her hand in his pocket and smiled at him

 Actually, the protesters surrounded a woman wearing a hijab during the protest and started shouting anti-islam slogans
 safia ne is najaare ko dur se dekha or vah maukey par pahunchakar us mahila ke bachaav main khadi ho gai
 After this, EDL members shouted at Safiya, but Safiya smiled, smiling, putting her hand in his pocket and staring into his eye and this moment was captured by the press association photographer in his camera
 tippaniyan Safia informed the BBC in conversation that she was not present on that occasion from any party or group
 unka vahaan hona ek sanyog tha lekin jab unhone idiel ke pradarshnakariyon ko us mahila ko ghere hue dekha to vah khud ko roak nahin pain
 Safiya said that after defending the woman, the protesters surrounded her but she was not scared at all

 bacchon kii thaaliyon se jahaan ek ore arhar kii daal puri tarah se gaayab hai vahiin duusari ore shiksha adhikari kuch bhi kah paane kii sthiti main nahin hai
 Expensive marbles were a problem; feeding milk to children in a low budget has remained a mess of the schools
 teacher samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki wo karen to kya karen? jimmedaari ke naam par adhikari thikra ek duusare par phod rahe hai
 This is the condition of almost every government school in Banda, UP
 menu ke mutabik guuruuvaar ke din bacchon ko daal or roti parosi jaani chahie lekin mahangaai kii vajah se bacchon ko daal kii jagah sabji parosi ja rahi he
 Apart from expensive pulses, milk remains the backbone of schools

 Dal retail outlets in the city Rs 200-220

 Whereas locally the local price of pulses is only Rs

 Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has only 18 days left, but Finance Minister Arun Jaitley says that no decision has yet been taken on the appointment of the head of this central bank
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke purv mukhya salaahkaar rajan ne june main hi ghoshnaa kar di thi ki vah arabiai governor pad par doosraa kaarykaal nahin lene ja rahe, aise main ummid he ki narendra modi sarkaar ke varisht mantri jetali, jald hi is pad par niyukti kii ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 However, when reporters asked him about this, he said, 'we will let you know when a decision is made about this
 ' piem modi ke saath baithak se lautne par vittamantri ne patrakaron se kaha, 'aapako jald hi nishkarsh kaa pataa chal jayega, prakriya kaa nahin
 ' raghuram rajan kaa teen varshon kaa kaarykaal 4 sitambar ko khatm ho rahaa he
 Rajan's image is rock-star among investors, as this former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund predicted the 2008 economic downturn much earlier
 aise main sarkaar rajan ke uttaradhikari ke chayan main khaasi maathaa-pachchi kar rahi he, taaki niveshkon kaa bharosa barkaraar rahe
 According to sources, the names who have been shortlisted as Rajan's successors include World Bank Chief Economist Kaushik Basu, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Urjit Patel, former Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn and State Bank of India Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya
 is
 sutron ke anusaar kowshik basu kaa vishwa bank ke saath kaarykaal 31 july ko khatm ho rahaa he or ve rigerv bank ke governor ke pad ke liye majboot daavedaar maane ja rahe hai
 However, it may also present some political problems, such as Kaushik Basu, who served as the Chief Economic Advisor for the previous UPA government and studied under the guidance of Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen
 bataa den ki 2014 ke aam chunaav main amartya sen ne pradhanmantri ke taur par narendra modi kaa virodh kiya tha
 Rakesh Mohan, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, has also been involved in this race
 haalanki unke kareebi sutron ke anusaar ve khud governor ke pad ke liye anicchhuk hai
 68-year-old Mohan is the oldest person in the race for the post of governor
 ve haal hi main yele uniwarsity main pad lene ke liye america ja chuke hai
 a finance ministry official told that the Prime Minister's Office may announce the decision in this regard soon
 haalanki philhal is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi he ki piem modi jetali ke prastaavit naam ko hi manjuur karenge
 The comments yahaan itnaa jarur he ki raghuram rajan ke baad governor ke pad par chaahe jo bhi aae mudrasphiti par niyantran paane ke liye us par niveshkon kii kadi najar rahegi
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Rajan, the former chief advisor of the International Monetary Fund, had announced in June that he was not going to take a second term as RBI governor, in the hope that Jaitley, senior minister in the Narendra Modi government, would soon announce his appointment
 can do
 haalanki jab patrakaron ne unase is babat poocha to unhone kaha, 'is bare main faisla hone par ham aapako bataa denge
 On returning from a meeting with PM Modi, the Finance Minister told reporters, "you will soon come to know the conclusion, not the process
" ' Raghuram Rajan's three-year term ends on 4 September
 niveshkon ke bich rajan kii chhavi rock-star kii he, kyonki antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke is purv mukhya arthshaastri ne 2008 kii aarthik mandi kii bhavishyavaanee kaaphi pehle hi kar di thi
 In such a situation, the government is making a lot of efforts in choosing Rajan's successor, so that the confidence of investors remains intact
 sutron ke mutabik, rajan ke uttaradhikari ke rup main jin naamon ko shortlist kiya gaya he, unamem vishwa bank ke mukhya arthshaastri kowshik basu, rigerv bank ke dipti governor urjit patel, purv dipti governor subir gokarn or bhartiya state bank kii adhyaksh arundhati bhattacharya kaa naam he
 According to sources, Kaushik Basu's term with the World Bank comes to an end on July 31 and he is considered a strong contender for the post of RBI governor
 haalanki isamen kuch raajnneetik dikkatein bhi pesh aa sakati hai, jaise kowshik basu ne pichhali upie sarkaar ke liye mukhya aarthik salaahkaar ke taur par kaam kiya he or ve nobel puraskaar vijeta arthshaastri amartya sen ke maargdarshan main adhyayan kar chuke hai
 Explain that Amartya Sen had opposed Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in the 2014 general election
 vahiin rigerv bank ke purv dipti governor rakesh mohan bhi is daud main shaamil rahe hai
 However, according to sources close to him, he himself is reluctant to hold the post of governor
 68 varshiya mohan governor pad kii daud main sabase bujurg vyakti hai
 He has recently moved to the US to take a position at Yale University
 vitt mantralay ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri karyaalay jald hi is babat faisle kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa he
 However, it is unlikely that PM Modi will approve the proposed name of Jaitley
 tippaniyan It is so important that after Raghuram Rajan, whoever comes to the post of Governor, investors will keep a close watch on him to get control of inflation
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
