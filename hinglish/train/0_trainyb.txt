 There was talk of an alliance between us and it was decided that the three contentious issues should be kept separate
 adwani or atal ji ke netritv main hamaare sanvaidhanik mulyon kii hameshaa raksha hui
 But now what is there is a matter of dividing the society
 upar se bhale hi baat ho sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas
 Now not just one leader, the entire party is going towards fundamentalism
 mere liye is par faisla lenaa mushkil nahin tha
 We did not come to do any government job

 Elections will be fought under your leadership in Bihar? If the people elect us then only the basics of the people will be carried forward
 abhi remote se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai ?ham to diarect sarkaar chalaa rahe the
 After the election it was said that i should resign

 Now that i have relinquished power, the matter of remote is meaningless
 bihar main argedy or jediu kaa vilay ho rahaa he ? netaa koun hoga ?saath baithenge, baat hogi to ho saktaa he
 Everyone was together before
 netaa koun hoga, yah to banane vaali party tay karegi
 You held a rally in Delhi, which will give special status to Bihar, we will be with it? We had said that the leaders who choose from Bihar should make the issue that who will give special status to Bihar will support it

 But they will tell that there is a difference in the statement of this matter

 The government, which is looking for a permanent solution to reduce the ever-increasing retail prices of petrol and diesel, may impose a tax on unexpected gains on domestic oil producers like ONGC

 aae din is jumale ko sunata rahata hum
 Many times we feel that we accept a jumle without thinking

 What happens to this Delhi heart? koun he jise dilli ke dil main itnaa bharosa he
 Is it because Delhi has a heart in its name
 par dilli dil se to bani nahin he
 Made of sill
 dehali kisase bani he yah ek alag vishay he
 But politicians and sloganists secretly thrust into this Delhi
 thel diya to thel diya
 What problem does anyone have from the heart, but the heart has started getting bored with heart-throbbing
 jab puure bharat ke liye ho rahaa he to alag se dilli ke liye dil kii kya zarurat he
 Is there no need of heart for Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh or Bihar
 slogan kii bhi apni ek seemaa honi chahie
 Today they bring the slogan of selling goods into politics seems hollow
 haa, indinon aise slogan ke siyaasi kharidaar bhi bahut hai or bik bhi jaataa he
 From FM radio to TV and on street hoardings, i often watch jumle created by combining heart and Delhi
 yah rishta itnaa ghis gaya he ki kam se kam mujhe to fark nahin padataa he
 This is just like writing some jumlets on the greeting cards of the new year
 ham unhen bina dakaar ke dakaare ja rahe hai
 Delhi is a rubbish jumla from the heart
 vaise hi jaise aapke liye nayaa saal mangalamay ho yaa ye mubarak ho yaa wo mubarak ho
 Our imagination and creativity have all gone blunt
 kya mangalamay ho or kya nayaa ho kisi ko thik se pataa nahin, lekin har koi ek duusare ko yah jumala thele ja rahaa he
 Delhi by heart or Delhi by heart
 donon main koi fark nahin he
 Terrible loneliness is increasing in this Delhi
 apni buniyadi zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye sangharsh jatil hota ja rahaa he
 After all, what city of the world will make Delhi better? kyon ban jaae
 Why should Delhi not remain Delhi? jise dekhakar duniya ke shahar dilli jaise ban jaaen
 Every best city in the world has the same crisis of poverty as the leaders are showing a false dream of making Delhi
 baat dilli banane ke nahin he
 The point is to build a socio-economic system where we can have your life safe
 kya koi aisi vyavastha bana rahaa he
 Ask the leader
 shaan ban jaae yaa dil se ho jaae is tarah kii tukbandiyon se azaad kiijie
 You should make the cities of India according to the custom here
 mahaan or behatar donon
 When Delhi becomes like Paris and Patna is like Venice then why would anyone go here to see it
 sab kuch tag line hota ja rahaa he
 Tag lines are junk born of creativity
 aap hordings ko dekhiye
 There are many types of tag lines inserted in a hoarding
 kai chehre munh phulaye muskaraa rahe hai ki aapkaa nae saal se lekar lohadi tak ke liye swaagat he
 Why welcome brother kya hamane kaha tha ki samaajwaadiyon, bhaajapaayiyon, congressiyon aap sab hamaara swaagat karo
 Look, don't forget
 aap swaagat nahin karoge to bharat ke ye teej tyohaar ujaad ho jaaenge
 The slogan waste being generated in the name of festivals is terrible
 jaise i-kachra hota he waisi hi slogan-kachra hota he
 Seeing these hoardings on a red light keeps the mind tickling
 ab to ganatantr diwas ko lekar jitna utsaah hota he usase kahin zyada ye dar baith jaataa he ki agali batti par phir koi pappu guddu ganatantr diwas kii badhaaiyon de rahaa hoga
 In the posters of congratulations, two or four of its top leaders also have carts in the top corner
 pappu yah nahin bataata ki usne ganatantr ke liye kya kiya he lekin chalo bhai badhai de rahaa he yahi kya kam he
 What could be better than this on Republic Day, make the city silent and congratulate
 kachra failaane kii badhaaiyaan aapane duniya ke kis shahar main dekhi hai ji
 Corporates keep removing such hoardings every day, but there are hoardings that stand anywhere to stare into your eyes
 ek din hamaari raajnneeti nigam waalon ko ganatantr virdohi ghoshit kar degi
 Pass through the Nizamuddin Bridge in Delhi
 samaj main nahin aata he ki saamne kii car dekhen yaa hording
 So encourage thinking in politics
 pehle makasad saaf kiijie ki dilli ke liye dil se kya karnaa he
 If the road is to be built, it can be done without heart
 kalege bhi aap bina dil ke kar sakate hai
 All you need is brain and budget
 haa, in sab kaamon main dil laga den to janata kaa bhala ho jayega
 The public only gives votes, sir
 lekin dil to aap lagaate nahin hai
 They put their minds there so that no one knows where the money in these hoarding advertisements came from
 hazaron lakhon logon ko raily ke liye le jane pahunchane ke liye paisa kahaan se aayaa
 Nobody knows what is happening in politics
 bas dil de dijie
 How to give heart like this pataa to chale ki mehboob hamaare dil ke kaabil bhi he yaa nahin
 So avoid these slogans
 aap mudde dekhiye
 Delhi is not an issue with the heart
 sabun or raajnneetik dal ke vigyaapan main koi fark hi nahin rahaa
 Politics is the way to change power and society
 is par bahes kiijie ki is disha main koi dil se kya baat kar rahaa he
 What is someone doing from the heart? dil kii baat karaten hai to ye nahin hoga ki ye vaala dil hindu kaa or wo vaala dil musalmaan kaa
 This is that of Pakistan dil hota he insaaniyat ke liye
 To create a society where we can say our heart
 dil kaa kaha sun saken or kisi ke dil ko thes na pahunchaaen, lekin iske liye sirf dilli hi ekmaatr dilavaali he yah baat bekaar he
 Any city can be Dilwala
 dil se aap goa se lekar gujarat or arunachal se lekar tripura tak ke liye kaam kar sakate hai
 So please keep politics away from this heartache
 puuchhiye ki kya hua he or kyon nahin ho rahaa he
 Why the poor are being marginalized, there are no jobs, then even in this recession, political parties have no shortage of money for advertising and expensive rallies
 ye sab aa kahaan se rahaa he ye bhi to puuchhiye dil se

 That is, the use of whatever can float in the water has saved thousands of lives
 lekin ye chijen saamne nahin aa rahi he
 Some are not coming out because they are not shown
 mujhe afsos he ki ye jaanboojh kar ho rahaa he ki jo local log or local partiyaan kaam rahi hai unhen naa dikhaaya jaae
 i myself have been there for nine days, i have given more than 4-5 dozen bytes but nowhere to be shown
 haa, aap helicopter pe chale jaao, to jarur dikhaai jaaengi
 But if you work on the ground, no
 hamaari taraf se hajaaron kii taadaad main log or sansthaaen, timen jameen par kaam kar rahe hai jinke kaam ko dikhaaya nahin ja rahaa he
 We also wholeheartedly appreciate the work of the Army and the Air Force, but my request to the media persons is that the manner in which their local institutions are working should also be appreciated

 It is good that Rohit is batting well consistently
 iskaa matlab he ki pari main der se aane ke kaaran mujhe thodaa alag role nibhaana pad rahaa he jo madhya overon ko sanbhaalanaa he or hardik pandya, kedaar jadhav, dhoni ko unka khel khilne ke liye swatantra chhodana he
 The captain said, "personal records are such that no player pays attention
 rohit ne bhi pichley match ke baad yahi baat kahi thi
 He is just trying to give his best and special things are happening in the process
 'kohli bhi is vishwa cap main lagaataar paanch ardhashatak jamaa chuke hai
 Kohli and Rohit would like their form to continue till July 14
 unhone kaha, 'isliye mujhe lagata he ki team sport main aapako chizon ke saath talmail bithaane kii jarurat hoti he
 i am happy that i am doing this and i hope that he will score two more centuries so that we can win two more matches
 yah behtareen aplabdhi hogi
 i have never seen anyone score five centuries in a tournament
 vishwa cap main to zyada dabaav hota he or yahaan wo behtareen khel rahe hai
 According to me, he is the world's top ODI player
 'kohli se jab unke role ke bare main or gaharaai se poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'main samaj chukaa hum ki vanade main aapkaa role badal saktaa he, yah nirbhar karata he ki aap kis samay ballebaaji karne ja rahe hai
 i am happy to hold one end and want the other players to reach 150, 160 and 200
 ant main main teji se ran bana saktaa hum
 Kohli also admitted that it would not be easy to face the New Zealand bowlers, especially when the weather was bad
 kohli ne kaha, 'newjiland kaa gendbaaji akraman hameshaa se santulit rahaa he
 Their fast bowlers are consistently doing well
 mishael santner madhya ke overon main apni yogyata se kaaphi niyantran lekar aa rahe hai
 They are a team that has always done well
 isliye ham jaanate hai ki hamen unke saamne behad anushaasan main rahanaa hoga saath hi sahi cricket bhi khelni hogi kyonki vah acchhee line or length par gendbaaji kar rahe hai
 When Kohli was asked about India's bowling attack, he said, "according to me, if our bowling attack is not the best in this tournament then it is close to that
 mujhe lagata he ki hamane jis tarah se do kam score vaale maichon main gendbaaji kii he wo shandaar he
 The players there have told what they can do

 However, Mathur did not oppose exempting Manish Sisodia

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the formation of a special task force so that the story of poor performance in the Rio Olympics is no longer repeated
 yah task force tokyo main hone vaale agle olympic kii taiyaariyon par bhi najar rakhegi or khilaadiyon ko zyada se zyada medal laane ke liye ranneeti banaaegi
 India's performance in the Rio Olympics has been extremely poor compared to last time
 pichhali baar 2 rajat or 4 kaansya padakon kii tulana main hamen is baar keval ek silver or ek bronj medal se santosh karnaa padaa he
 In such a situation, instead of reviewing the performance of the Indian party, we are immersed in the celebration
 padak jeetne vaale khilaadiyon par jaise kuber meharbaan ho gaye hai
 Governments have rained offers
 jaraa sochie, agar silver or bronj ke alaava ek gold aa gaya hota to kya hota?sindhu par hui karodon kii barishario main silver medal jeetne vaali badminton khilaadi pivi sindhu or kushti main kaansya padak jeetne vaali sakshi malik karodpati ban gai hai
 Apart from this, offers of government jobs, houses, land and expensive cars have also been received
 sakshi ko pramotion bhiyahi haal haryana kii sakshi malik kaa bhi he
 Malik was promoted as a gazetted officer by the Railways
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar ne sakshi ke pita sukhbir malik ko bhi pramotion dene kii peshkash kii jo ditisi main bas conductor hai
 Apart from all this, along with Sindhu and Sakshi, two more players will also be given the Khel Ratna Award which did not win a medal in the Olympics but did well
 
 
 
 But the treasury did not open at the time of preparation
 It is worth noting that the amount of reward for the players who won medals in the Olympics is more than the amount of preparations for organizing this Mahakumbh
 yani inpar inaamon kii jitani dhanavarsha hoti he utane paise to inke training main bhi nahin kharch kiye jate
 If training is given more attention and sports federations are freed from politics then the situation would be better and there is no craving for one medal each
 idhar laga di paison kii dheri
 
 
 
 euke sport ne olympic taiyaari ke liye 2013-17 ke bich 350 million dollar kii rakam tay kii, vahiin bharat sarkaar ne yuva maamalon or khel bajet main 500 million dollar yaa 3,200 karod rupee die
 If we compare this amount with the annual sports budget of Britain's sports infrastructure and training, then it constitutes only a third part
 britain kaa khel bajet 1
 5 billion dollars or 9000 crores rupees
 britain ne jite 67 padakon main har padak par 4
 Spent an amount of 1 million pounds (more than 36 crores)
 vahiin 2016 ke rio olympic kii taiyaari par usne 275 million pound kii rakam kharch kii
 At the same time, only two of India's 117 players won the tournament
 khel mantralay phir kyon?jahaan khel mantralay ke vajood kaa sawaal he to iske rahane yaa na rahane se koi fark nahin padataa
 The biggest example is the United States where there is no such thing as the Ministry of Sports, while it remains at the top of the Olympic medal table
 bharat main keval 2 medal aae to jashn kaa maahaul he jabaki china padak talika main duusare paaydaan se khiskkar tisare par aa gaya to use niraashaa ho rahi he
 Chinese media has also tightened up about India's performance in the Olympics
 china kii media kaa kahana he ki bharat khelkud kii buniyadi suvidhaon par bahut kam kharch karata he isliye yah bade or pratispardhaatmak khelon main peeche rahata he
 If there is a need for work, then there will be some cracking of the players who returned empty handed at the Rio Olympics in North Korea
 yahaan ke shaasha kim jong ne medal nahin laane vaale khilaadiyon ko koyale kii khadaanon main kaam karaane kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 Not only this, such players may also have to lose many facilities including ration cards
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kim jong ne olympic main jane waalon ko 17 medal laane kaa target diya tha lekin jab kul 7 padak hi aa sake
 Take a little learning from them as well
 
 
 
 However, all the countries around the world give rewards and bonuses to their players who returned with medals from the Olympics
 singapore sarkaar ne maaikel felps ko peeche chhodkar apane desh ko pehla gold dilaane vaale joseph schooling ko 10 lakh singapore dollar kaa puraskaar diya
 However, 20 percent of this will be spent on the development of the game
 udhar sabase adhik medal jeetne vaale america khilaadiyon ke liye bonus kii rakam pehle se tay he
 There, the Olympic Committee gives 25 thousand dollars to the gold winner, 15 thousand dollars to the silver winner and 10 thousand dollars to the bronze winner
 lekin yahaan khilaadiyon ke prashikshan par kahin zyada kharch kiya jaataa he
 There can be revolution for yoga, so why not for this, India needs to learn from them
 olympic main padak nahin milane par trahimam machaane se adhik isaki taiyaariyon par kharch kiya janaa chahie
 The government should look for a champion and should be provided with all the resources to carry it forward
 agar bharat main yoga ko lekar abhiyaan chalaaya ja saktaa he to olympic ke liye mishan kii shuruyaat kyon nahin kii ja sakati
 If the Indian sports administration wakes up now, it is not in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but after that the medals in the 2024 Olympic Games are sure to rain

 Nawab Liaquat Ali Khan, Pakistan's Parliamentary Secretary for Information Technology, made this statement at the National Assembly
 unhone kaha ki internet par ashleelata ek gambhir masalaa he or isse nipta ja rahaa he

 During the hearing of the case, Justice Arun Mishra said that some services of telecom companies do not work at all

 After this, Justice Mishra said that 6 out of 10 calls drop from me
 unhone kaha ki in sabhi sarvice main kamiyaan hai, isi vajah se aisi baaten saamne aati hai
 Significantly, the issue of call drop has been going on for a long time
 jise lekar graahakon kii taraf se kai baar shikaayat darj kii ja chuki he
 At the same time, the matter is in the Supreme Court and the Center has been reprimanded
 isse pehle bhi jab ye maamla saamne aayaa tha tab telecom regulatory athurity of india (TRAI) ne in maamalon par swatantra jaanch karaane kaa vaada kiya tha

 The country's Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani has come into controversy by showing a hand to an astrologer
 smriti ravivaar raat rajasthan ke bhilwara main jyotishi nathulaal vyas ke paas pahunchin or apana bhavishya poocha
 Many on social media are criticizing his attitude as 'unscientific'
 fasebuk or twitor par kai logon ne likhaa he ki vaigyaniktaa ko badhaava dene ke bajaay desh kii shiksha mantri andhvishwasi karmkaandon main uljhi hai
 Explaining the matter, Smriti Irani just said that she does not even have her own horoscope
 maamle par safai dete hue unhone betuka bayaan de daalaa
 He said, 'what i am doing in my personal life, it increases your TRP and makes you profitable
 lekin agar mere raajnneetik jivan par mere vyaktigat kaam kaa asar nahin pad rahaa to mujhe nahin lagata ki aap logon ko aisa kuch dikhaane se phayda hoga
 Iran's unique fund raising for GDP is that on Sunday, she reached out to astrologer Nathulal Vyas with Union Minister husband Zubin
 vah kareeb chaar ghante yahaan rukeen or apane bhavishya ke bare main sawaal kiye
 Vyas told Smriti Irani that he is likely to move to a higher chair in the coming times
 sutron ke mutabik jyotishi ne smriti ko yah bhi bataaya ki vah teen-chaar saal main desh kii sabase yuva raashtrapati banane kaa gaurav bhi paa sakati hai
 If sources are to be believed, Vyasa has also asked Smriti to chant the Mahamrityunjaya mantra
 maamle par alpsankhyak maamalon kii mantri najma hepatulla ne kaha ki jyotish ek pracheen vigyaan he or yah smriti irani kaa nijee maamla he
 At the same time, Uma Bharti smilingly said, 'I will say this much that i will not say anything
 ' haalanki vipakshi partiyon kii ore se aalochana ke swar jarur aa rahe hai
 Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar said, 'I will congratulate him
 itnaa kahana chaahunga ki desh kii shiksha mantri ko vigyaan par bharosa karnaa chahie na ki andhvishwaas par
 BSP supremo Mayawati said that she does not believe in astrology herself, but she will not comment on anyone's personal things
 vah isse pehle bhi do baar nathulaal vyas ke yahaan aa chuki hai
 Vyas had earlier predicted his promotion, which turned out to be true
 smriti irani kaa jyotishi ke paas janaa isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonkidilli main bijepi ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ko lekar unka naam khabaron main he
 Significantly, Nathulal Vyas is the astrologer whom former President Pratibha Patil used to visit
 vyas kii bhavishyavaanee ke baad hi patil raashtrapati bani thim
 Astrologer Vyas does not speak in response to a question, he answers by writing on a slate with chalk
 dilli waalon ko kejariwal sarkaar ke aane vaale bajet main mahangaai kaa jhatka lag saktaa he
 In fact, this year, Delhi's VAT has been much lower than expected
 isliye tex vibhaag ne kai saamaanon par waite badhaane kaa prastaav sarkaar ke paas bheja he
 The Kejriwal government may approve a proposal to increase VAT rates on many goods in the coming budget
 vibhaag ke sutron ke anusaar kamai badhaane ke liye dilli ke tred or tex vibhaag ne jin saamaanon kii list sarkaar ke paas bheji he, unamem kapade, sharaab, tambaakoo, upies, plastic ke kuch saamaan or aataa bhi shaamil he
 If the government accepts the proposal of the department, then people's flour can also get wet in inflation
 dilli kii kamai kaa sabase bada jariyavat(vat) hi he, jisasesarkaar apane bajet kaadhe se zyada hissaa kamaati he
 But this year, far below the target of 24 thousand crores, only about 19 thousand crores have been earned
 jabaki saal khatm hone main 15 din se bhi kam kaa vakt bachaa he
 Sources reveal that in the proposal sent by the Trade and Tax Department to the government last month, a proposal to impose VAT of up to Rs 200 per square meter of expensive clothes, wheat and rice flour, ready-made clothes from Rs 2000 and five per cent on plastic
 Can
 in sab par abhi koi bhi waite nahin lagata he
 At the same time, the tax department has also sent a proposal to increase VAT on inverters from 5 percent to twelve and a half percent
 tambaakoo or sharaab par bhi waite maujuuda 20 fisadi se badhaakar 25 fisadi karne kaa vichaar he
 Significantly, last year, the budget of Delhi did not increase the VAT rate on any goods
 lekin sutron kii maane tosarkarmen aalaa str par hi waite kii daron par antim faisla hoga
 It is possible that some of these proposals of the Trade and Tax Department in the budget should be changed

 The reason for this column centered on Rahul Gandhi's return for the second consecutive time is not that he has made a huge impact
 yah to aane vaale maheenon main dekha janaa baaki he
 The issue is related to what he said, especially from what he had said in his first speech in Parliament, provided it was said with full seriousness
 ab tak kukhyat ho chuke apane jumale 'suut-boot' se modi kaa majaak udaana rahaa ho yaa phir time patrika main obama kii saraahna par modi ke chatukaaron or internet samarthakon ke manaae jashn par tippanee, yah sab sansadeey raajnneeti main chalata he
 He further said, however, that Americans appreciate those foreign leaders who are his customers
 aise naam ginavaate hue unhone gorbachev kaa hawala diya or kaha ki unhone rus kaa vighatan karke america kii madad kii
 In his brief statement on the cameras outside, he also added the name of Boris Yeltsin to the US President's favorites as he privatized Russia's industries
 itane samay pehle kii in ghatnaon ko dobaaraa ginavaaye jane par kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 For example, where is Rahul taking his lessons from history? Do they really believe in what they are saying and if not, do they not know that they are the leaders of the second largest party in the country and they are of the past era
 ke
 Will it be taken more seriously than Tiwari or Kalpnath Rai or today's Mani Shankar Aiyar? If this is the case, then they should return to Zen master Thik Nat Han to study this time
 kya ve vastav main yah maanate hai ki mikhail gorbachev america pitthu the, deshadrohi the, na ki ek vaishvik netaa jinhone na sirf afghanistan main anyaaypurna jang par viraam lagaaya balki upniveshikrut soviet 'ganraajyon' ko dobaaraa aazaadee hasil karne kaa rasta banaaya? isi tarah, kya ve yah maanate hai ki bahut zyada vodaka pine vaale yeltsin bhi america agent the? chaliye, or zyada tikhe sawaal poochhate hai: berlin kii diwaar girane ko rahul gandhi acha maanate hai yaa bura? maanavtaa or swatantraaa kii disha main yah ghatana ek badi chalaang thi yaa phir sheet yuddh main zyada bhale gut kaa aatmasamarpan, jisase bharat ko nuksaan hua?is sawaal ko main itane jumledaar tareeke se isliye puch rahaa hum, kyonki main is baat se chakit hum ki iske nihitarthon ko gambhirtha se nahin liya ja rahaa he, khaskar isliye kyonki khud unke bayanon ko jumale kii tarah liya ja rahaa he

 Whenever Congress is in crisis, blaming and attacking America directly or indirectly is a tried-and-tested strategy
 aisa 1969-71 main hua tha, phir immergency se pehle or us dauraan bhi yah doharaaya gaya jab chile ke salvador alende or bangladesh ke shaikh mujiburrahman kii hatya ke bahaane siie-america khatre kaa hauva khadaa kiya gaya
 In the early years of the same period, one of the founders of the Swatantra Party, another tremendous humor-rich MP, Pilu Modi, suddenly appeared in Parliament with a badge that read, "I am an agent of the CIA
" " jise dekhakar har koi hansi se fat padaa tha
 The question arises as to how the sudden re-incarnation of this devil will be seen in 2015, when the completion of 25 years of the fall of the Berlin Wall, while Angela Merkel from the east is the third time chancellor of unified Germany and the undisputed leader of the European economy
 It has been made? We can also see history from the perspective of india-us relations

 saath ke dashak tak america shanti kaaryakartaaon kaa bharat main swaagat kiya jaataa rahaa tha
 This picture began to change due to Indira Gandhi's left-leaning after 1971

 india-us relations deteriorated only once during the 1971 war when India signed a mutual strategic pact with Moscow, keeping distance from nixon-kissinger

 Furthermore, the recent inaugurations (gary Gass's The Blood Telegram and Srinath Raghavan's 1971) illustrate India's strategic constraints on how nixon-kissinger's soft policy towards China left Indira with no option
 maine pehle ke ek stambh main bataaya tha ki kaise khud indira gandhi ne hi 1980 ke baad ise durust karne kii koshish kii

 That was due to some of the systematic mistakes and wrong handling of Bofors scam (I have never seen any evidence, nor believe that he would have made any money, just he showed seriousness in dealing with it) when Rajiv Weakened, he then went on to attack America with a "granny will remind", which led to his disarray

 kolkata main tiemasi kii vaarshik shahidi diwas raily main mamata banerjee ne kaha tha ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bengal rasta dikhayega
 Let us tell that in 1993, 13 Congress workers were killed outside Victoria House
 jiske baad se har saal yahaan shahidi diwas manaaya jaataa he
 Mamata Banerjee, during PM Modi's speech at Midnapore rally, took a dig at the BJP, referring to the incident of the fall of Pandal and said, 'those who cannot make a Pandal want to build the country?' Let us know that during the PM Modi's rally in Bengal's Midnapore this week, about 90 people were injured due to the fall of the pandal
 raily ke dauraan hi mamata banerjee ne kaha ki trinmul congress aagaamee 15 agast se modi sarkaar ke khilaaf 'bijepi hataao, desh bachaao' abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karegi
 Also on 19 January a mega rally will be organized which will include politicians from different parts of the country
 unhone kaha ki ham 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pashchim bengal se sabhi 42 siten jeetenge
 The great Hollywood philosopher, the late Bob Hope, while defining diplomacy, said that this is the art of describing Jane Russell without shaking her hand
 budhimatta kii aisi baat ko koi tab tak thik se nahin samaj saktaa, jab tak use jine rasel ke angon ke parimaap kii gahari samaj na ho
 Bob Hope knew him a lot
 jine aisi abhinetri thim jo, agar shaleen shabdon main kaha jaae to, kisi blouse main jaan daalkar farsh par pade anaavashyak saamaan batorne ko bhi ek shandaar kartab main badal sakati thim; camere or donon stanon ke bich ke sthal main ek adbhut kaamkaaji sambandh tha
 Bob Hope introduced Jane Russell as 'two and Only'
 bharat-pakistan kootneeti kii kala isse ain vipareet andaaj main he, jahaan haath hi haath hai, koi jine rasel nahin
 India and Pakistan do not talk to each other; They talk about each other
 videsh sachiv nirupama raav or unke pakistani samakaksh salmaan bashir jab agle kuch dinon main phir milenge, to ve isaki pushti kar denge
 The most secretive thing about the india-pakistan talks is that there is nothing left to talk about
 donon desh buniyadi hakikaton ke prati puri tarah sachet hai: yah ki parmaanu shaktiyon ke bich vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye yuddh koi vikalp nahin he
 He is also aware that the stalemate creates deep points of contention, which can become increasingly uncontrollable, and escalating tensions can jump towards strung missiles
 unhen ehsaas he, bhale hi ve ise khuleam sweekaar na karen, ki kashmir ke nakshe kaa bhugol badla nahin ja saktaa or sari lachchhedaar baaten gharelu bhaawanaaon ke liye gadhi gai hai, antarrashtriya sapatabayani ke liye nahin
 This applies to Pakistan more than India, because India is satisfied with the status quo and would consider it to be the basis of an agreement
 pakistan, adhikrut taur par, aisa nahin kar saktaa, par bahuprachaarit 'musharraf formule' main, vastav main, is baat ko maan liya gaya tha ki ekmaatr samaadhaan sambhawatah kisi samjhaute main ek yaa do jumale jodakar daavon ko khatm karnaa or jamini hakeekat ko sansthagat swaroop dena he
 The six decades of declared and unannounced wars have not been able to move the boundary even six inches, and this will not happen in the next six decades as well
 bharat, pakistan ke bich koi samjhauta aaj tak is pratyaksh kaaran se nahin hua ki kisi ko samajhane kaa yah aparyaapt tarika he ki shanti bahuvaanchit samruddhi kaa sabase aasaan tarika he
 So the idea would be to stop Rao and Bashir from wasting time on bilateral issues
 ve is maukey kaa prayog saamaajik meljol ke liye kar sakate hai, or rochak menu ke liye acha-khaasaa sarkari bajet bhi hota he
 The crisis, which severely damaged the Agra summit between Pervez Musharraf and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, began with breakfast served with eggs of a French name that i cannot pronounce
 lekin chunki videsh sachivon kii baithak khaane ke shaukeenon ke naashte se zyada mahatvapurn he, yahaan bin maange ek salaah prastut he
 If they agree on the agenda of a linked goal, they can do some useful, real and practical work for their political masters: how to turn SAARC into an anti-poverty system and such an axis of thought Ideas that establish dynamic economic relations through flexible trade, if not free of goods, services and finance
 bharat or pakistan ne dakshes deshon ko us dushchakr main fansaa liya he, jise unhone apane ekapaksheeya sangharshon ke jariye paidaa kiya he
 As a Sufi saying goes, when you are imprisoned in a vicious cycle, make a big circle
 dakshes vah bada chakra he, jiske jariye agle dashak ke is vichaar ko praathamikta banaaya ja saktaa he ki garibi rekha se neeche rah rahe aadhe arab se zyada logon kaa aarthik utthan kiya jaae
 There is also another idea, which is worth considering with eggs and toast
 parmaanu ardhchandra puure asia par pasra hua he
 Israel, Iran, Pakistan, India, China, Japan and Russia are nuclear forces
 japan ke paas parmaanu hathiyaar nahin hai, lekin jaisaa ki ab tak najar aa janaa chahie, akele bam hi khatra nahin hote hai
 Radiation does not follow any limits
 nishchit taur par parmaanu suraksha par shikhar vaarta kaa samay aa gaya he, or aisa prastaav bharat-pakistan sahyog ke madhyam se kyon na saamne aae? yadi ye do pratidwandvi saajha lakshya bana len to isse ve apane daayre se kahin bade kshetra main ek nayaa vaataavaran banane kii paristhitiyon ke nirmaan main madadgaar honge
 The current disputes, however absurd, however old or new, do not necessarily impede cooperation where it is possible
 garibi unmoolan yaa paryaavaran sangrakshan ke liye bharat or pakistan ko kashmir jaise puraane ghaav par, yaa afghanistan jaise taaja vivaad par sahamat hona jaruri nahin he
 But alas! All these things are daydreams
 dilli or islamabad ke pratishthan kisi nae vichaar kaa sanket milte hi apane sahaj khol main simat jate hai
 An open mind is full of risk, but through thinking and preparation risk can be minimized
 bob hope agar is upmahadweep kaa parichay vishwa se karaate, to sambhawatah ve kehete ki bharat or pakistan 'tu and da only' (donon khaas kism ke) hai
 The People's Committee Against Police Atrocity (PCPA), backed by the Maoists, has claimed responsibility for the Gyaneshwari Express derailment, killing at least 65 people and injuring more than 150 passengers
 police mahanireekshak (kanoon evam vyavastha) es karpurkysth ne kaha, ‘‘railway trek ke najadik pisipie ne do poster chode hai jinamein train ke patari se utarane kii spasht rup se jimmedaari lee gai he

 tatkaaleen vidhayakon dwaara kii gai baghawat ke kaaran july main congress-jad(es) kii sarkaar gir gai thi or uske baad rajya main bijepi ne sarkaar bana lee thi
 By-elections are to be held in the constituencies from which unqualified mlas come from
 yediurppa ne 2018 main haare ummidavaaron or bhaajapa ke tikat ke aakankshiyon ko yah kahkar santusht karne kaa prayaas kiya he ki un logon ke liye rajya sanchalit board evam nigamon main avasar gadhe jaaenge
 He told reporters in Shikaripura in Shimoga district, 'by-elections are near, dates for 15 seats have been announced
 amit shah ne kaha ki istipha dene vaale or bijepi se chunaav ladane ke icchhuk logon ko seat (tikat) die jaaenge, yah hamaari jimmedaari he
 'he said,' If you want to stand on behalf of our party, you will be given priority, candidate will be made
 aapaki jeet kii jimmedaari bhaajapa kaaryakarta or netaaon kii hogi
 Yeddyurappa's comments are significant in the sense that voices are being raised from within the BJP against giving by-election tickets to ineligible mlas
 congress ke ayogy vidhayak bisi patil ne yediurppa ke bayaan kaa swaagat kiya
 However, he said that unqualified mlas have not yet considered joining the BJP
 unhone kaha, 'adaalat ko hamaari yogyata ke bare main faisla karne dijie uske baad ham is par vichaar karege or faisla lenge
 'the BJP must win at least six seats in the upcoming by-election to stay in power
 jharkhand vikaas morcha (prajatantric) ke 6 vidhayak buudhvaar ko bijepi main shaamil ho gaye

 Earlier, the BJP formed the government in the state with the support of its 37 mlas and mlas of Sudesh Mahato-led AJSU
 ab sattarudh gathbandhan ke paas 48 vidhayak ho jane se 81 sadasyeey rajya vidhansabha main uski sthiti majboot ho gai he
 Asked why the BJP is engaged in breaking other parties, Das said, "I am not willing to break, but am connecting others
" jo log jharkhand ke vikaas main bijepi sarkaar kii madad karnaa chaahate hai, unka swaagat he
 On Tuesday, 6 mlas of Jhavimo wrote a letter to the Jharkhand Assembly Speaker requesting them to be allotted seats in the House along with the mlas of the ruling coalition
 jhavimo ke adhyaksh babulal marandi ne aarope lagaaya ki sattarudh bijepi unki party jhavimo or congress ke vidhayakon ko todane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 He alleged that there is a difference between bjp's words and actions
 isse pehle jhamumo ne apane chaar vidhayakon ko party virdohi gatividhiyon ke aarope main party se nilambit kar diya tha
 Marandi was earlier in the BJP and it was under his leadership that the first NDA government was formed in 2000 in Jharkhand

 Although the finance minister has announced a package for Bengal in the budget, but Mamata Banerjee is not happy with it and she has a political reason
 agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko dekhte hue bijepi ke liye bengal kaaphi ahm he
 Right now she has only one MLA here, but she is trying to increase her number

 com / uhrlmovokn Omaxe, a company involved in the development of real estate, has said that it has canceled the affordable housing project of 80 thousand crore rupees
 iske tahat company kii agle paanch saal main desh bhar main 10 lakh awaas banane kii yojana thi
 Omaxe Chairman and Managing Director Rohtas Goyal said the 2008 recession affected all developers, so the project could not start
 hamane kuch jagahon par kuch ghar banane kii koshish kii
 
 
 Now this project has been canceled
 may, 2008 main company ne kam aay varg ke upabhoktaaon ke liye duusare or tisare darje ke shaharon main paanch saal ke dauraan teen se 15 lakh tak ke 10 lakh ghar banane kii vistrut pariyojna kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 He said that the company based in the national capital had tied up with farmers in Gujarat and Maharashtra to acquire land in relation to building houses at low prices
 goyal ne kaha, haalanki ise antim swaroop nahin diya ja sakaa
 He, however, declined to say whether the company had invested the money to start the project
 2008-09 ke vaishvik vittiya sankat ne realti kshetra ko buree tarah prabhavit kiya or maujuuda aarthik maahaul main phir se aisa hi hone kii ashanka he

 Considering the opposition's demand, the government sent the Mines and Minerals (regulation) Bill as well as the Coal Mines (amendment Bill) to the Select Committee
 vipaksh lagaataar kah rahaa tha ki sarkaar sansad kii tay prakriya kii andekhi kar in bilon ko jaldbaazi main paas kara rahi he or in bilon par charchaa honi chahie
 The Government has constituted two Select Committees of Rajya Sabha to discuss both Bills, which will submit their report to Parliament before 18 March
 gauratlab he ki sansad ke bajet satr kaa pehla hissaa 20 march ko khatm ho rahaa he or sarkaar usase pehle in donon bilon ko paas kara lenaa chaahati he
 It is believed that the government has taken this middle path in view of the strong opposition of the opposition
 vipaksh adhyadeshon ke jariye kanoon banane or phir baad main sansad kii sahmati lene kii baat kaa lagaataar virodh kar rahaa he
 While the Opposition is angry with the 'imposition' of the Mineral and Mines Bill through an ordinance, the Opposition on the Coal Bill says that it is a bill to prepare a way for private companies to sell coal in the open market
 sipiem netaa tapan sen ne kaha, ''yah kanoon koyala kshetra kaa or nijeekaran karne kii disha main kadam he, jisase kol india jaisi company kamazor hogi or nijee companiyaan koyala niryaat bhi kar paaengi

 '' On the other hand, the land acquisition law is still drawn by swords
 lagata he, sansad ke bajet satr ke pehle hisse main zamin adhigrahan kanoon rajyasabha se paas na ho paae
 The government does not have a majority in this House of Parliament and the opposition is united against many provisions of the bill

 beeti raat fasebuk ke mukhiya mark jakarberg america senetters ke saamne maujuud the or vahaan unhone kaaphi tikhe sawaalon ke jawaab die
 During this, Zuckerberg spoke about Facebook's business model, which is ad-based
 sadhe shabdon main kahen to fasebuk yugers kii jaankariyaan ikattha karata he or un jaankariyon kii madad se vigyapandaata yugers ko vigyaapan dete hai
 In such a situation, whatsapp has been forgotten when the eyes of the whole world are on Facebook in terms of information from users
 darasal, fasebuk yugers kaa data ikattha karata he or vigyaapan dikhaata he lekin watsap kaa bijness model is tarah kaam nahin karata
 No ads are shown in whatsapp yet
 naa hi kisi prakaar kaa koi bhugtan yujaron dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, questions can also arise regarding the functioning of whatsapp
 kyonki watsap kii pareint company khudfesabukahai
 a few days ago, experts have expressed concern about the security features of whatsapp
 unka maananaa he ki ye utane pukhta nahin hai jitna ki inke bare main daawa kiya jaataa he
 Experts have questioned some of the provisions of its Users Agreement, where most of its wrongdoing is not caught or challenged
 is par watsap kii ore se bayaan jari kiya gaya tha or bataaya gaya tha ki wo keval thodi jaankaree ikattha karata he or har massej and-tu-and encripted hote hai
 But immediately after this, media reports revealed information about whatsapp's payment policy, that the company shares information collected under the payment privacy policy from third party service providers, including Facebook
 company kaa kahana he ki wo jaankariyaan isliye saajha karti he taaki wo pement oparations ko behatar kar sake
 The privacy policy also states that the information shared with third party services includes your mobile phone number, registration information, device identifier, vpas (virtual payment address) and the UPI PIN and payment amount of the sender
 haalanki watsap ne jaankaree di thi ki company aisa bhugtan prakriya ko behatar banane ke liye karti he
 But overall payment related data is being transmitted to Facebook, so nothing can be said about what Facebook uses this data
 saath hi yahaan par ye jaan lenaa bhi jaruri he ki watsap ne kuch samay pehle kaarobaariyon ke liye alag ap launch kiya tha, yani watsap bhi kahin naa kahin yujaron cadatistemaal nikat bhavishya main istemaal kar saktaa he
 At present, all the rights of the company are with Facebook and there is no clear information for its business model
 sawaal ye he ki agar watsap free he or fasebuk kii tarah vigyaapan ke liye graahakon ke data kaa upyog nahin karata, to aakhir iskaa bijness model kya he
 And if whatsapp also supplies data with Facebook, then when will its cleanliness come to light
 is par logon kii nigaah kab padegi
 Will Mark Zuckerberg give any answer in terms of whatsapp? andhra pradesh ko vishesh darja dene kii maang par adi tidipi endie se alag hone kii kagaar par he

 saath hi kaha ki unhone bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ke pradesh kii pichhalirabadi devi sarkaaraki maang kaa virodh nahin kiya tha
 Addressing public meetings during the rights conference organized in Bhagalpur and Banka districts on the grant of special state status to Bihar, Nitish said that he did not oppose the demand of the previous Rabri Devi government in the state to grant special state status to Bihar
 did
 nitish ne kaha ki pichhali atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ke baad centre main samprag sarkaar satta main aayi par unhone (lalu ne) centre main mantri rahete hue kyon nahin kaha ki unki patni rabari devi kii sarkaar ne bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang kii thi vah ab de diya jaae
 He said that the RJD supremo does not like the establishment of the rule of law during the NDA rule in Bihar
 kya lalu chaahate hai ki bihar main phir se apharan udyog chaalu ho
 Nitish said that his (lalu's) Parivartan Yatra meant that Bihar would return to the old state of the RJD regime again to end the rule of law and establish the rule of terror
 unhone kaha ki pehle bihar ko duusare naamon se janaa jaataa tha
 There were reports of terror and kidnapping, but today the change has come
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rajd supremeo lalu prasad kaa naam liye bina pradesh main satta parvithan ko lekar unki yatra kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki bihar main vigat saat saalon main jab is tarah kaa badlaav aayaa he to ve kis tarah kaa parivartan chaahate hai, ve khud apane seene par haath rakhkar sochen

 upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne daawa kiya tha ki wo 15 june tak upi kii sabhi sadakon ko gaddhamukt karvaa denge
 Yogi's claim was to free up 60 thousand kilometers of roads in UP
 to kya gaddha mukt ho gayi upi kii sadaken? ajtak kii team ne is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye upi ke kareeb 21 jilon main yogi ke daawey kaa reality check kiya
 When Yogi Adityanath claimed to free up the streets of UP by June 15, Aaj Tak was also challenged to come out on the streets with a camera
 15 june aane main ab mahaj kuch ghante hi baaki hai, lekin upi kii tamaam sadakon kii haalat abhi bhi utani hi khasta he
 In many places, roads were found to be pit-free, but the condition of most of the roads is still poor
 ab to koi chamatkaar hi upi kii sabhi sadakon ko gaddha mukt kar saktaa he
 The story of roads in Gondagonda itself is telling
 railway stesan jane vaali sadak par gaddhon kii bharmaar he
 Trains on the road to the bus station are less moving, more bouncing
 gonda-balrampur road forlan banani thi, lekin is par abhi dhul hi dhul he
 Businessman Arvind Srivastava says that the total failure is that of administration
 balrampurgonda se sata balrampur atal bihari vaajapeyi or nanaaji deshmukh kii karmasthali rahaa he, lekin yahaan kii sadakon kaa haal bura he
 The distance from Gonda to Balrampur is just 45 kilometers, but the road is such that if you reach in two and a half hours, then it is a privilege
 sant kabir nagaryogi adityanath kii karmbhumi gorakhpur se sate sant kabeernagar kii sadakon kii taraf bhi prashasan kii tavajjo nahin gai he
 It is difficult to drive on the road connecting the national highway to the BATC route
 maharajaganjagorakhpur ke padosi jile maharajaganj kii tamaam sadakon ko dekhakar bhram ho saktaa he ki sadak main gadde hai yaa phir gaddhon main sadak
 Maharajganj is a border district of Nepal
 nepal ko jodne vaali maharajaganj thuthibaari road main bhi bade bade gadde hai, jiske chalate aae din yahaan haadase hote rahete hai
 In Ballia district of Ballia East Zone, there are also many potholes in the roads
 espi daftar ke saamne kii sadak main bade-bade gadde ho chuke hai, kotwali ke saamne bhi sadak kaa bura haal he
 People here are not sure that by June 15, the roads will be pit free
 maubaliya ke kareeb mau kii kuch sadakon par gadde jarur bhare gaye, lekin shahar ke mukhya margon ko jodne vaali zyaadaatar sadaken aaj bhi tuuti hai
 Here, walking on the road means passing through pits
 yogi ke daawey yahaan aundhe munh pade hai
 People are saying that if what has not happened yet, what will happen in two days
 gajipurjo haal mau kaa he, kuch vaisaa hi gajipur kaa bhi he
 There are large pits on the National Highway bypass
 gajipur shahar ke mukhya fullanpur railway crossing ke paas to jaanaleva gadde hai
 The philanthropist Brij Bhushan Dubey hangs the chest on the chest, advises people to avoid the pits
 mirzapurmirzapur ko aurai se jodne vaali aurai-mirzapur road kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi he
 This road connects Mirzapur with Bhadohi and GT Road
 lekin is sadak par aise gadde hai jinamein ek baar gaadi funs jaae to phir nikle nahin
 The ministers of the Yogi government are claiming to fill the pit by June 15, but no one is convinced of these claims
 rajendra prasad, mantri gramin abhiyantran ne kaha, "puure mirzapur mandal kii 90 sadaken gadda mukt kii jaani jaahie thi
 Work is in progress at 5, he will have to do it by 15 June
 15 june ke shaam tak mujhe yah report mili ki puraa nahin hua to jo doshi hoga nilambit hoga
 "local resident Dharmendra said," He even spoke to Aurai that Gadda would be freed but not done yet
 das se pandrah saal se sadak kharaab he
 It was hoped that the road would be built, but now it is not possible
 "sonbhadra, mughalsarai, elahabaad, jonpurupi ke zyaadaatar jilon main sadakon kaa kamobesh yahi haal he
 If the roads in Sonbhadra are broken, then many roads did not start to be constructed in three years
 mughalsarai or elahabaad kii sadakon kaa haal kharaab he
 The same situation also exists in the streets of Jaunpur
 lalganj, raibareliunnav se raibareli road kii haalat bahut hi zyada kharaab he
 This road near Lalganj is badly broken
 sadak kam he, gadde zyada hai
 It is one of the busiest roads in UP, but getting rid of carts on this road is not a laughing matter
 kareeb 85 kilometre kii is puri sadak kaa haal kuch aisa hi he
 The chances of this road being good till June 15 are not seen very far
 mathuraye bhagwaan krishna kii nagari mathura kii sadaken hai
 This road in Mont area connects Mathura with rural areas
 lekin is sadak par do-do feet gahare gadde hai
 The 11 km long road going inside the city from NH-93 in Hathrashathars is uprooted
 bade vaahanon se udati dhul or upar se bade-bade gadde haadason ko daavat dete hai
 The same condition is of the road going from Sikanderrau to Kasganj, the road from Sikandararau to Jalesar
 pilibhitapilibhit main puure shahar kii sadaken khudi padi hai
 The main road to the Puranpur tehsil is uprooted
 pilibhit main 700 kilometre sadaken gaddhamukt honi hai
 But 50 percent work is not done yet
 tamaam sadakon main gaddhon par khaali pathar daal die gaye hai
 Just look at the streets in front of the Collectorate Gate and the government guest house of the PWD to know the story of the streets in Lakhimpur Kherilkheempur
 jab itani ahm jagahon kii sadakon par itane gahare gadde hai to baaki jile kaa kya haal hoga, aap andaja laga sakate hai
 Seeing the pits in the roads, it is not possible that by June 15, these roads will be pit free
 farrukhabadlerrukhabad kii mukhya sadakon par to gadde jarur bhar gaye, lekin shahar ke bheetar or gramin ilaakon kii sadakon kaa haalat kharaab he
 The paved bridge road, the road to Devrampur, are the pits in which vehicles come out with hiccups
 etaeta ko kasganj, badaayun, bareli se jodne vaali sadak kii to haalat bahut khasta he
 The pits are more, the road is very less
 shahar ke mukhyamarg par pani bharaa hua he
 etah-jalesar, jalesar-nidhauli Road also has a rough condition
 bagpatye bagpat jile main dilli-yamunotri hive kaa haal he
 There are bricks on the highway
 jisamen jagah-jagah gadde bane hue hai
 Carts are often stuck in these pits
 iske baad ghanton jam ke halaat ban jate hai
 June 15 is about to come, but the road is still waiting for the pit to be filled
 hapurkuch aisa hi haal hapur jile kaa he
 Most of the roads in the district are broken
 garh tehsil main to sadakon kaa haal or bhi bura he
 Here the distinction of roads and pits disappears
 yogi adityanath ne gaddha bharne ke liye 15 june kii dedline tay kii thi, lekin 12 june tak to kaam shuru bhi nahin hua tha

 bollywood ke king shahrukh khan kii film jiro 21 disambar ko relies hone ja rahi he
 This film also means a lot to Shahrukh along with the fans
 25 saal se zyada samay se film industry main chhaae romance king ke liye, apni badshahath banaae rakhane ke liye jiro kii saxes ahm he
 However, Shah Rukh himself expressed his determination to stay in the industry during the promotion of Zero
 unhone kaha tha, "agar jiro nahin chalati he to mujhe 6 maheene tak industry main kaam nahin milegaa
 "shah Rukh's magic could not go on, looking at Shah Rukh Khan's previous films," Harry Met Sejal "directed by Imtiaz Ali was badly rejected by the audience
 iske pehle ai gauri scindia ke nirdesan main bani 'dear jindagi' bhi box offis par khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa saki
 Although the film was appreciated
 donon hi filmon kaa jaadu feekaa rahaa
 No big hit film came after Shah Rukh's 'raees'
 romance king kaa rutaba banaae rakhane kii chunautishahrukh ko bollywood kaa romance king kaha jaataa he
 But for the last few years, they are finding it difficult to maintain this status
 king khan kii romantic drama 'harry met sejal' shahrukh ke hone ke baad bhi flop hui
 Now his status is expected to remain intact from zero

 There has been no film worth 100 crores in Shahrukh's account for a long time

 The story of Shahrukhjiro, who became a dwarf for the first time, is that of a dwarf man
 shahrukh khan ne apane kirdaar ke saath ek tarah kaa risk bhi liya he
 The character of the dwarf person is rarely seen in the Hindi cinema
 vaise in dinon phens real or ekperiment kahaniyon ko pasand kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, Zero's story can be successful in bringing people to the screen of cinema

 But it will be proved by the audience response at the box office

 The 11-year-old child accused of kidnapping an infant is two and a half years old
 aaropee ko shanivaar ko juvenil court main pesh kiya gaya jahaan se use hisar sthit bal sudhaar ghar bhej diya gaya
 According to Shivaji Colony police, the accused picked up the infant from the play school, saying that his parents had sent him to bring the infant home
 aaropee use le kar ek sunsaan jagah gaya or uske pita ko phiroti ke liye phone kar unase teen lakh rupee maange
 Shishu's father is an accountant in a private finance company
 unhone tatkaal police ko suchit kiya
 Police formed four teams to trace the kidnapper
 aaropee ke mobile phone kii lokation ke aadhaar par police us tak pahunch gai or shishu ko uske kabje se chhudaa kar uske parivaar ke paas pahunchaaya
 My grandmother used to narrate an anecdote repeatedly, the story is like this, "it was a big house, exactly like a palace
" usamen rahanevaala parivaar dhan-dhaany se bharaa-puraa tha
 But some such calamity occurred that the whole family became fascinated by money and money
 ab karen to kya karen? ghar itnaa bada tha ki us ghar ke kai kamare to kabhi khole bhi nahin gaye the
 Well, these people started living by juggling some no-bread
 ek din ek sadhu aayaa
 He asked the family to bring something to eat
 ab karen to kya karen, ghar main to kuch tha nahin
 The monk understood
 usne kaha, rahane do
 Skip the food
 mujhe raat gujaarne ke liye koi aisa cameraa do jiskaa tumne saalon se istemaal na kiya ho
 The family members said, Sadhu Maharaj, there are many rooms which have been closed for years
 unhone kaha, thik tum unamem se kisi ek ko kholkar saaf-safai kar daalo
 The head of the house himself went to open the room
 cameraa kholte hi keval usamen kooda-karkat hi najar aayaa
 The AAP chief first cleaned the ground, then the shelves
 jab aakhri almaari usne kholi to chakit rah gaya
 It had a pitcher full of gold coins
 vah mukhiya sadhu ke paas gadaa lekar aayaa or kaha, maharaj ham samaj gaye aap hamaara bhala karne aae hai
 Then the family opened every room in their house, washed, wiped and got some money from every room
 yah kahani kitni sachhee thi, yah to daadi hi jane, lekin ek baat tay he jindagi main ham apane vyaktitv ke kai hisson ko kholane kii koshish nahin karte
 We are afraid of cleaning up the filth of this part of a person who has been lying vacant for years
 matlab nakaaratmakataa ham par is kadar haaavee rahati he ki ham us gandagi ke bare main to sochate hai lekin yah kabhi nahin sochate ki kya pataa is kooday ke dher main koi keemtee khajaana na dabaa ho?ek kadam aage, do kadam pichherajani meri ek client thi
 Filled with anger
 gussa aisa ki kab kis par baras pade, kuch pataa nahin! aasapaas ke log use behad gussell ladki kahkar uske naam se bidak jate the
 My experience was saying that this is not the real Rajni
 khayr usase chaar mulaakaaten karne ke baad usne bataaya ki vah backbenchar thi
 Nobody used to notice him
 ghar main bhi uske shant swabhaav kii vajah se vah andekhi-si bani rahati thi
 But he noticed that his anger makes him a point of discussion among the people
 bas kya tha usne khud ko diconstruct karnaa shuru kiya
 But because of this anger, her own nature was so deeply submerged that even now she could not find it even if she wanted to
 ab uskaa koi dost nahin
 The people of the house make a distance from him
 phir kya tha, usko maine apane vyaktitv ke bheetar saalon se band pade daravaaje kholane ke tareeke bataae
 Way number one: Whenever you get angry on something, question yourself, could there be any other reaction? Write that topic in the diary, then write the response below it
 jo tumne kii or vah bhi jo tum kar sakati thi, bina gussaye, bina jhallaaye
 Approach the number two: If you had not given that angry response to the person, how would he have responded back to you? Just have to give ten minutes before bedtime
 tarika number thrigtum kisi chhavi apni chaahati hum
 Angry girl or calm, balanced and helpful? Even though my grandmother told this story, the essence of this story is the basis of Buddhist psychology
 or kya pataa hamaare purvajon ne bhi kisi aise vyakti se yah kahani suni ho jis par buddha siddhanton kaa anuyaayi ho
 By the way, when the Indian temper can be seen in China's Chaumin, then why not in the story of any other religion
 isliye is kahani kii jad khojane se behatar he iske sikh par dhyaan den
 Better to find a psychologist or a councilor in your practice who has sidelined your personality or started doing it
 rojaanaa ham khud hi apane bheetar utarkar uski safai kar len
