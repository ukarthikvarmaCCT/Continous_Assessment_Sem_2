 Men are the head chefs in many renowned hotels in the country and the world
 baavjood iske aaj bhi ghar main khaanaa banane kaa kaam sirf or sirf mahilaon kaa hi mana jaataa he
 In how many houses have you seen men standing in the kitchen preparing lunch or dinner? Although it is not that the number of men helping the wife in cooking is negligible but it is also true that the number of such men is very less
 ek ore jahaan ye kadavi sachai he vahiin ek sachai ye bhi he kilgbhag har patni chaahati heki uskaa pati kabhi-kabhi hi sahi par uske liye kooking kare
 But do you know why married women want this? 1
 dulaar or pyaar mahasoos karne ke liekun nahin chahta he ki uskaa partner use pyaar kare
 Someday you do not feel like doing your work and your husband himself will tell you that if he cooks today, then you will definitely feel special
 partner kii ye koshish aapako aaraam dene ke saath hi unke pyaar kaa ehsaas bhi karaayegi
 With this, there will be a change in everyday life
 mahilaon ko acha lagata he ki unka partner unhen lekar samvedansheel he
 2
 saath samay bitaane ke liemahilaon kii is ummid ke peeche doosraa pramukh kaaran ye he ki unhen apane partner ke saath samay bitaana acha lagata he
 Cooking takes a lot of time
 zyaadaatar gharon main to patniyaan kichan main khaanaa banaati rahati hai aurpati apane kaam main vyast rahete hai
 But when the husband is cooking, the wives stand by him and help
 saath gujaarey gaye ye halke-phulke pal unke rishte ko or adhik majbootee dene kaa kaam karte hai

 ghar main santulan kii sthitikoi bhi super human nahin ho saktaa
 Who can handle all the work from home and outside and not tired after that
 aise main behatar hoga ki ek ghar kii jimmedaari sirf or sirf patni ke kandhon par na daalkar pati-patni use aadha-aadha baant len
 a little help given by the husband in the kitchen is also very much to give relief to the wife
 isse kaam bhi jaldi nipat jayega or kisi ek par puraa boj bhi nahin padegaa

 bacchon ke liye bhi hogi ek sikhbache kaa ghar uskaa pehla skool hota he
 Where he learns by seeing and hearing everyday things
 jab baccha dekhtaa he ki uske mata-pita donon hi ghar ke kaamon ko samaan rup se baantkar kar rahe hai to uske man main gharelu kaamon ko lekar bhi izzat aati he
 Otherwise, in most cases it has been seen that children underestimate household work and believe that earning money by going out is everything
 ye soch galat he or maa-baap apni is koshish se hi bachche ko ye samajha sakate hai
 5
 jivan main ek nayaa rang aata hahar roj ek hi dincharya kisi ke liye bhi boring ho sakati he
 In such a situation, if the husband cooks occasionally, there will be a newness in the routine
 na keval patni balki pati bhi ise rachanaatmak kaam ke rup main lekar injoy kar sakate hai

 seshan court ke jaj rabindra kumaar joshi ne shanivaar ko thik teen baje apana faisla sunaaya
 With Salman getting bail, his loved ones across the country breathed a sigh of relief
 salmaan kii jamaanat yachikapar jodhpur ke district jaj ravindra kumaar joshi ne sunwaayee kii or shanivaar ko lunch ke baad teen baje ke kareeb apana faisla sunaaya
 The court granted Salman bail on a personal bond of fifty thousand
 haalanki court ne ye bhi kaha ki salmaan khan bina court kii parmishan ke desh se baahar nahin ja sakate
 Government lawyer Bhawani Singh Bhati opposed Salman's bail and said that the film actor should not be granted bail
 unka kahana tha ki yah sajaa ke nilamban kaa maamla he, koi niyamit jamaanat kaa maamla nahin
 He said that despite the transfer, it is not right to give the decision of the judge
 lekin jaj joshi ne salmaan ke vakil kii daleelon ko sweekaar karte hue film abhinayta ko jamaanat de di
 Five arguments of Salman's lawyer that strengthened Bell's claim-1
 salmaan ke vakil ne court ko bataaya- in 20 varshon main salmaan ne hameshaa court kaa sammaan kiya
 During these 20 years, Bell never jumped and was always present in court during the trial
 unhone jaanch main bhi puraa-puraa sahyog diya
 2
 vakil mahesh bora ne kaha- salmaan nirdosh hai, unhen jhuthe cese main fansaaya gaya
 After the bail, Bora said that we have got justice
 3
 Salman's lawyer gave the example of the Arms Act case related to the black deer hunting case in his plea, saying that it has not been confirmed that Salman's gun was present at the site of the incident
 unhen is cese main hoicourt dwaara bari bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 4
 vakil ne daleel di ki salmaan ko jamaanat di jaani chahie
 The denial of bail will violate their basic rights
 5
 Bora said that if Salman is not granted bail, he will have to spend some more time in jail without any reason
 mahesh bora ne sawaal bhi uthaae ki salmaan dwaara jail main bitaye gaye dinon kaa jimmedaar koun hoga? unhone salmaan dwaara kiye gaye saamaajik kaaryon kaa bhi hawala diya

 yahi vajah he ki 'aap' netaaon ne unhen punjab main nai jimmedaari di he

 Let us tell you that Yogesh Varshney, former Mandal president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in Aligarh, expressed his anger on the lathi charge on Hanuman devotees in West Bengal's Virbhoomi district on Tuesday, who beheaded Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for 11 lakh The reward was announced
 jiske baad trinmul congress ke jiladhyaksh ramphul upaadhyaay ne yogesh ke khilaaf aligarh ke civil lines thane main report darj kara di
 However, by evening, the BJYM leader realized his mistake and retracted his statement

 While issuing a fatwa against Yogesh who had announced a reward of Rs 11 lakh to the bearer who beheaded Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Barkati said that if anyone beats Yogesh's head, he will be given a sum of Rs 22 lakh
 unhone kaha, "mamata banerjee hamaari sammanit netaa hai or main unhen apni bahan kii tarah maanata hum
 i will give Rs 22 lakh to whichever BJP leader comes to me
 aisa lag rahaa he ki fasivadi aresas-bijepi gundon kii bhashaa bol rahi hogi
 "remind you that Barkati is the one who has come into the limelight many times by issuing edicts against all politicians including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Salman Rushdie
 shaam ko di bhajayumo netaa ne safaibuudhvaar shaam yogesh ne patrakaron ke saamne apni safai di
 He said in his clarification that he had seen the news of shouting slogans of Jai Shri Ram in Veerbhoomi on news channels and social media
 jiske baad unki bhavanaaen aahat huin
 In the same charge, he announced the reward for beheading
 apni safai dete hue yogesh ne kaha, "mujhe khed he
 The BJP high command that will punish is acceptable
 "kya tha elaanyogesh varshney ne buudhvaar subah elaan kiya tha ki, "jo bhi pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa sir katkar laaegaa, main use 11 lakh rupee bataur inaam duungaa

 peshey se vakil virendra sangwan ne 2014 main dilli hoicourt main ek yachika daayar kii ki aspataalon main stant kii keemat bahut zyaada vasuuli ja rahi he
 Sangwan demanded that the stent be inserted into the National List of Essential Medicines (NELM)
 sangwan ko jab pataa chalaa ki faridabad ke ek aspataal main stant ke liye 1 lakh 26 hazaar rupee liye gaye or uske bakse par keemat bhi nahin likhi thi tab inhen pataa chalaa ki sarkaar stant kii keemton ko regulate nahin karti he, isliye aspataal yaa dealer manamaane daam vasuulate hai
 At the same time, it was found that by reaching the operation table from the company, the price of the stent increases by 1000 to 2000 times
 sangwan apana cese jeet gaye or dilli hoicourt ne centre sarkaar ko aadesh bhi de diya, magar sarkaar dhilaai baratati rahi

 It is now heard that since fixing the price of stent, hospitals have started to make the package of angioplasty expensive

 aap jaanate hai ki stant kai tarah ke hote hai
 The price of drug eluting stents and bioresorbable stents has been increased to 30,000
 sirf metal stant kii keemat 7,500 rupee fiks kar di gai he
 The first drug eluting stent costs 24,000 to 1
 5 lakh tak hua karti thi
 The price of bioresorbable stents ranged from one lakh seventy thousand to two hundred ninety thousand
 ab donon hi 30,000 main milenge
 It is a good decision, it will provide relief to many
 is report ke dauraan internet par research karte hue jaankaree mili ki 2016 ke saal main bharat ke aspataalon main 6 lakh stant kaa istemaal hua
 Now think that you got 30,000 stents installed in one and a quarter to two and a half lakhs
 aspataalon ne stant ke zariye kaaphi kamaaya he
 It was also read at many places that 25-30 percent of people from India to America were put on stents, whereas they could only be cured with medicine
 ab jo aadesh hua he, uske anusaar aspataal apane bill main alag se bataayenge ki stant kii kitni keemat vasuuli gai he
 a question is being raised with praise for this decision, if nothing is done on it, then this compliment will have no meaning
 matlab aspataal aapse stant ke tees hazaar hi lenge magar baaki chizon ke daam badha denge
 What will you do then
 baat ye uth rahi he ki america main kis sthiti main kya karnaa he, isaki puri prakriya tay he
 There too, he has made huge profits in hospitals by installing stents without need

 ek baat uth rahi he ki clinical establishment act kii zarurat hogi
 What is this, what will happen with this, we will talk
 times aaf india kii rema nagarajan ne in baton par khub reporting kii he
 His old report shows that GB Pant Hospital in Delhi had become a factory to install stents
 maheene main vahaan 1000 stant lagate the
 Rema Nagarajan's report of March 14, 2015, states that doctors asked most patients to buy stents from private shops instead of stents from the hospital
 sarkari aspataalon main stant kaa rate 23,625 rupee he
 Private suppliers sold stents from patients for Rs 68,000 and Rs 42,000 instead of 23,625
 2014 ke agast tak is aspataal main 12,000 stant lage the
 Of these, 7,200 stents were purchased outside the hospital at a heavy price
 baad main jab hangaamaa hua to astpal ne baahar se stant laane par roak laga di
 The comments jin logon ko stant ke bare main zyaada jaankaree nahin he unhen sankshep main bataanaa zaruri he ki stant hota kya he
 It is a kind of small ring, like a small spring or balloon which is fitted in the arteries of the heart where the blood flow has stopped or is reduced due to cholesterol freezing
 is prakriya ko angeoplasty kaha jaataa he
 a thin tube in the body called a catheter is delivered to the heart through the large arteries of the feet and hands
 is puri baatcheet ke dauraan ek mahatvapurn sarkari mahakme kii jaankaree bhi aapako honi chahie
 This is NPPA i
e
 National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority
 is santhaan kaa kaam desh main dawaaon kii qimaton par kaabo rakhana he
 Monitoring and correcting the shortage of medicines also comes under its purview
 NPPA dawaaon se judi nitiyon or qimaton par sarkaar ko salaah bhi detaa he
 In the month of May last year, the NPPA fixed the ceiling of 81 medicines
 inamen cancer, diabetes, hisertension, epilepsy, bacterial infections jaisi bimariyon kii dawaaen shaamil thim
 Virender Sangwan, a lawyer by profession, filed a petition in the Delhi High Court in 2014 that the cost of stents in hospitals was going to be much higher
 sangwan ne maang kii ki stant ko National List of Essential Medicines (NELM) main daalaa jaae
 When Sangwan came to know that Rs 1 lakh 26 thousand was taken for a stent in a hospital in Faridabad and the price was not written on his box, then he came to know that the government does not regulate the price of the stent, so the hospital or the dealer arbitrary Is charged isi dauraan pataa chalaa ki company se oparation teble tak pahunchate-pahunchate stant kii keemton main 1000 se 2000 guna kii badhottaree ho jaati he
 Sangwan won his case and the Delhi High Court also ordered the central government, but the government continued to lax
 july, 2016 main avmaananaa yachika daayar kii gai ki sarkaar court ke aadesh ke anusaar kaam nahin kar rahi he
 The government took the decision after filing another petition in December 2016
 iske tahat ab sarkaar ne saare aspataalon ke liye stant kii keemten tay kar deen
 Millions of patients can benefit from this decision if the hospital does not take out other ways of earning due to fixing the price of the stent so that the patients have to pay as much money as before
 abhi se sunai dene laga he ki stant kii keemat fiks karne ke baad se aspataalon ne angeoplasty kaa package manhagaa karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Another heroine of this story is Doctor Meera Siva of All India Drug Action Network
 inhone bhi isaki ladaai ladi he
 You know that there are many types of stents
 drug alutting stant or biorezorbeble stant kii keemat 30,000 kar di gai he
 Only the price of metal stent has been fixed at Rs 7,500
 pehle drug alutting stant kii keemat 24,000 se 1
 There used to be 5 lakhs
 biorezorbeble stant kii keemat ek lakh sattar hazaar se lekar do lakh nabbe hazaar hua karti thi
 Now both will meet for 30,000
 acha faisla to he hi, isse bahuton ko raahat milane vaali he
 During this report, while doing research on the internet, it was found that in the year of 2016, 6 lakh stents were used in hospitals of India
 ab sochiye 30,000 kaa stant aapane dedh paune do lakh main lagavaaya
 Hospitals have earned a lot through stents
 kai jagah yah bhi padhane ko mila ki bharat se lekar america tak main 25-30 pratishat logon ko stant lagaaya gaya jabaki wo sirf dawa se thik ho sakate the
 According to the order that has been made now, the hospitals will separately tell in their bill how much the cost of the stent has been recovered
 is faisle kii tarif ke saath ek sawaal uth rahaa he agar us par kuch nahin kiya gaya to is tarif kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 Meaning, the hospital will charge you thirty thousand stents, but will increase the price of other things
 tab aap kya karenge
 The matter is arising that in the situation in America, the whole process of what to do is decided
 vahaan bhi bina zarurat ke stant lagaakar aspataalon main baari munafa kamaaya he
 Therefore, the process of operation and installation of stents should be fixed and then the regulator should be made to monitor this process, which will come from outside and audit the hospitals
 2009 main america main dil ke doctoron ne stant lagane kii ek guideline banaai thi
 After that the effect was good
 766 aspataalon main 27 lakh stant prakriya kaa adhyayan karne par paaya gaya ki vahaan ab bejaruri stant lagane kam ho gaye
 Earlier 25 percent of the unnecessary stents were seen, then now 13 percent are being found
 giravat ai he
 One thing is arising that the Clinical Establishment Act will be required
 ye kya he, isse kya ho jayega ham baat karenge
 Rema Nagarajan of Times of India has done a lot of reporting on these things
 unki puraani report se pataa chalata he ki dilli kaa jibi pant aspataal stant lagane kii factory ban gaya tha
 There were 1000 stents a month
 14 march, 2015 kii rema nagarajan kii report kahati he ki zyaadaatar marizon se doctoron ne kaha ki aspataal se stant kii jagah privet dukaanon se stant kharid kar laaen
 The rate of stent in government hospitals is Rs 23,625
 privet sapliron ne marizon se 23,625 kii jagah 68,000 or 42,000 rupee main stant bechaa
 As of August 2014, the hospital had 12,000 stents
 inamen se 7,200 stant aspataal ke baahar baari keemat dekar khride gaye the
 Later, when there was an uproar, Astpal stopped bringing stents from outside
 tippaniyan Those who do not know much about the stent, it is important to briefly explain what the stent is
 ye ek tarah kaa chota challa hota he, kisi choti spring yaa baloon jaisaa jise dil kii dhamniyon main us jagah feet kiya jaataa he jahaan cholestrol jamane kii vajah se khun kaa pravaah band yaa phir bahut kam ho gaya he
 This procedure is called angioplasty
 sharir main ek patali tub jise catheter kehete hai uske zarie ise pair or haathon kii badi dhamniyon ke raste dil tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 During this entire conversation you should also be aware of an important government department
 ye he NPPA yani National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority
 The job of this institute is to control the prices of medicines in the country
 dawaaon kii kami par nigaah rakhana or use thik karnaa bhi iske kaam ke daayre main aata he
 The NPPA also advises the government on medicines-related policies and prices
 pichley hi saal may ke maheene main NPPA ne 81 dawaaon kii qimaton kii ceiling tay kar di thi
 These included medicines for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, bacterial infections
 is faisle se lakhon marizon ko phayda ho saktaa he basharte aspataal stant kii keemat fiks karne ke kaaran apni kamai ke duusare raste na nikaal len jisase marizon ko pehle jitna hi paisa dena pade
 It is now heard that since fixing the price of stent, hospitals have started to make the package of angioplasty expensive

 siyaasi drame ke bich bijepi main bhi baithkon kaa daursomvaar ko do baar meeting main jute bijepi netaaj phir bulaai gai bijepi kor cameti kii baithkamaharashtra main kiski sarkaar banegi, ye wo sawaal he jiske jawaab kaa intjaar har koi kar rahaa he
 But this question is still suppressed in many layers of politics
 shivasena ne congress or ensipi ke samarthan kii ummid main bijepi se 30 saal purana gathbandhan tak tod diya he, baavjood iske wo sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh nahin kar pai he kyonki congress-ensipi ne samarthan par antim nirnay nahin liya he
 That is, the suspense on the government is still intact and in the midst of this whole political drama, BJP also seems to be preparing for some preparation

 sudhir mungantiwar ne bataaya ki hamane 'wet and vaach' kaa role nibhaane kaa nirnay liya he
 What the BJP is waiting for now is very important
 kyonki rajya main jo halaat paidaa ho rahe hai usamen abhi tak yah sthiti spasht nahin he ki shivasena ke netritv main nai sarkaar kaa gathan ho jaae
 In such a situation, if the Shiv Sena does not get the support of the Congress and the NCP, then the role of BJP will become important once again and the key to power can again come into its hands
 lihaaja, bijepi na sirf shivasena, ensipi or congress ke bich pak rahi khichdi par gahari najar banaae hue he, balki khud bhi active bani hui he

 khatarnaak landingsthayee avarodhon ne patna ranve ko kaagaj main darj lambaai se 400 meter chota banayaayah baat dashakon se pataa he ki patna hawaldda jet vimaanon ke utarane ke liye surakshit nahin he
 When an aerial analysis was conducted after Alliance Air's plane crash killed 60 people on June 17, 2000, more than 100 blockages were found on both runways, 07s and 25s en route to flights
 inamen bijli ke khambhe, ghantaghar or pedo jaisi asthaayee baadhaaen bhi thim
 These barriers not only reduce the length of the runway available to the aircraft, but also disrupts the ILS signals, rendering them useless
 9 november, 2010 ko antarrashtriya nagar vimaanan sanghathan (isieo) ne faisla sunaaya ki patna hawaipattee kii vaastavik lambaai 1,556 meter hi he, jabaki airport athurity of india (eei) or nagar vimaanan mahanideshaalay (sijisie) isaki lambaai 1,954 meter hone kaa daawa karte hai
 In this way it is 924 meters shorter than the 2,480 meters needed for landing of Airbus A320-200 aircraft and 534 meters shorter than the 2,090 meters required for landing of Boeing 737-800
 dijisie ko patna hawaondde ko nae sire se paribhaashit kar use 4si airodrome se 3si ghoshit karne kii salaah dete hue isieo ne kaha ki yah sirf chote terboprop vimaanon kii landing ke liye hi upyukt he
 Ranganathan said, "if calculated on the basis of high temperatures and elevations from the sea surface in summer, the declared length of Patna airport may be reduced and it can prove to be a huge threat to the operation of the jets
" 
 16 november ko india today ke i-mail ke jawaab main dijisie arun mishra ne daawa kiya, ''85 fisadi avrodh (ped) eei ne hataa die hai yaa kam kar die hai
 And because of this it has become fit for landing of runway jets
 ” lekin unhone sthaayee baadhaon ko sweekaar nahin kiya or is baat par jor diya ki patna ke ielas ko aisi baadhaon se takaraakar aane vaale secondary sanketon se koi khatra nahin he
 Most pilots will tell you that the landing of Boeing or Airbus in Patna is like a 'nightmare'
 ek payalat ne bataaya, ''pedo ko paar karne ke baad teji se neeche aane kii jarurat kii vajah se kai baar vimaan khatarnaak dhang se asthir ho jate hai or tatkaal jameen par utarane ko majaboor hona padataa he
 "CASAC believes that serious concerns of air safety often dominate politics and business concerns
" patna ke lokanayak jaiprakash narayan hawaii adda ke maamle main dijisie kii ore se jari (e0516 / 12) ek notem (notice tu airmen) main eei se kaha gaya he ki vah 16 agast se vahaan bowing or airbas kii udaanon par roak lagaae
 But it was withdrawn after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar wrote a letter to Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh
 nitish ne is pratibandh ko 'taalane’ kaa anurodh karte hue 6 agast ke apane patr main kaha tha, ''sthaneey akhabaaron main chhapi khabaron se aisa lagata he ki eei ne 16 agast, 2012 se sanshodhit ghoshit (ghatai gai) duuri ko lagu karne kaa nirnay liya he
 This will significantly reduce the operation of aircraft from Patna and will cause huge inconvenience to everyone
 ”ranganathan or unki team kaa kahana he ki patna ek badi aapadaa kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 Contrary to the claim of DGCA and State Governments, they say that the number of blockages at the airport has only increased
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki kisi bhi maukey par vahaan se jet vimaanon kii udaan kii ijaajat nahin deni chahie kyonki ranve chota he or ''land karne vaale har vimaan ke ek taabut banane kii ashanka bani rahati he
 “this warning should be enough for the Ministry of Aviation and the state government
 lekin lagata nahin he ki koi sun rahaa he
 There is no scope for fault
 There is a lack of facilities for civilian flights on military airbases like Jammu
 The aviation sector watchdog has demanded a similar ban on the flight of jets from Jammu
 yah mul rup se ek sainya airbase he or ranve kii lambaai 2,054 meter he
 There is neither RESA nor mandatory 60 meter strip at either end
 is hawaondde kii suraksha or bhi daanv par lagi he kyonki ranve ke donon taraf said pattee bhi nahin he or ranve 36 ke liye ielas loklizer jis jagah lagaaya gaya he vah isieo ke niyamon or eei ke minial ke mutabik nahin he
 It is separated by a brick wall and barbed wire and is near a busy common road
 indigo airlines ke ek varisht payalat bataate hai, ''ielas se nikle sanket aasapaas ke nirmaan se vichlit ho jate hai or hawaondde par pahunchane vaale vimaan isse bhramit hote hai
 After the 60-meter strip of the end and 90 meters of RESA, the length of the runway of this airport is reduced to just 1,700 meters
 chote ranve ke alaava jammu main pakshiyon kii baari maujuudagi ek alag samasya he
 Apart from this, pilots have also complained of "unexpected drone activity (small aircraft with no maneuver) over Jammu airfield"
 iske alaava vahaan aasapaas udaan bhi simit hi kii ja sakati he kyonki padosi pakistan apane hawaii kshetra kaa ulanghan sahan nahin kar saktaa
 "despite knowing these real problems, Mishra does not seem inclined to impose a ban on Jammu airport
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki suraksha ke lihaaj se jaruri atirikt kshetra na hone kii samasya jaldi hi hal ho jaaegi kyonki eei ko van bhoomi milane vaali he
 Till then pilots and passengers will have to pray to God every day to avoid death as the jet flights to Jammu continue unabated
 khatarnaak phislankalikat hawaondde par rabad kaa motaa jamaav landing main badi samasya9 july, 2012 ko baari varsha ke dauraan kalikat main utarate samay air india express bowing 737-800 teji se phislaa or sanbhalte-sanbhalte bhi yah kai ranve liton ko tod chukaa tha
 Although there were no injuries to passengers, it raised many serious security questions
 2010 main mangalore main hui vimaan durghatana kii kahani dohraye jane kaa andeshaa tha yahaan
 In August 2011, an investigation by Arun Rao, a member of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (kasak), revealed that Calicut's airfield was not suitable for large-sized aircraft such as Boeing 747s and 777s and Airbus A330s
 ye vimaan us hawaondde kii suvidha kaa istemaal sirf isliye kar rahe hai kyonki nagar vimaanan mahanideshak (dijisie) ne ise 4i code ke aircraft ke liye license de rakhaa he
 Then in 2012, a survey conducted by Ranganathan suggested that this airport, located in the middle of the hilly area, be reduced to a 4C range and given a 150m sideways and 240m runway and safety area at both ends — both
 There are international security buffers
 ranganathan bataate hai, ''ise shuru karne ke baad 747 jaise baari vimaan ko udaan bharne main koi dikkat nahin aegi
 He further said that the runway of the decaying coal tar in which the huge junk of tires has been collected, the rain and dust spread from the flights of the aircraft, makes it slippery on the ground and reduces its friction capacity
 vimaan ke tej gati se zyada aage nikal jane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Interestingly, the DGCA was seen stealing the India Today question
 mishra kii daleel he, ''bi-747 or 777 vimaan kaaphi samay se kalikat se udaan bhar rahe hai
 "on top of that, the us-based air safety expert responded on condition of anonymity," Continually unsafe behavior cannot be called safe
 ” ve bharat sarkaar ke saath kisi vivaad main nahin ulajhna chaahate
 The firefighting capabilities and adequate means of rescue at the airport, Mangalore, inviting the threat, are not present
 Most passengers do not even know that a plane crash like 2010 was going to happen again on June 25, 2011
 air india kaa express bowing 737-800 ranve se lagbhag baahar chalaa gaya tha
 Like a shipwreck a year ago, the captain opened the throttle (valve that stops the flow of steam in the engine) to succeed in stopping the aircraft safely
 usee samay sah-payalat ne budhimaani kaa parichay dete hue vimaan ko teji se peeche kiya or ranve ke thik kinare vimaan ko roak liya
 In 2012 itself, instead of landing on the runway, on August 14, the second Express of Air India went ahead touching it fast and managed to get back in the second time itself
 vimaan ko nuksaan pahunchaa, lekin saubhaahgya se yatri surakshit the
 It is a matter of fact that even after two years of the plane crash, neither the Ministry nor DGCA or AAI took any step towards a solution
 niraash ranganathan ne purv vimaanan sachiv or kasaakh adhyaksh naseem jaidi ko 20 may, 2012 ko bataaya, ''dijisie ne hamaare kisi suzav par amal nahin kiya
 “mangalore still does not have firefighting capabilities and adequate means of defense
 philhal chaar rojenbor krash tenders or ek tatra vaahan hai jo hawaondde ko aag se surakshit rakhte hai
 But that mountainous slope connected to the thin road is still denied safety
 ranganathan kaa kahana he ki mangalore main hawaondde ke najadik ke ghani aabaadi vaale ilaake bachaav or agnishamak sahaayta pahunchane main baadha khadi karte hai
 This is the reason why Kasak has suggested at least 240 m for the Ressa
 iskaa matlab he ki ranve chota ho jayega or airlinon par boj sambandhi paabandiyaan lagengi
 "AAI had committed to this in a meeting held in July 2010 with Kasak
 lekin kuch hua nahin
 Political and commercial concerns have become more important to them
 ”neshnal aviators gild ke sevanivruth adhyaksh or jet airways ke purv senior payalat 66 varshiya girish kowshik ko hawaonddon kii hakeekat ko nazarandaaj karne ke dijisie ke ravaie par koi hairat nahin hoti
 "it seems that these regulators (DGCA, AAI) are meant to serve the interests of airline management," he says
 sach unki apni aakshamata kii pole khol degaa isliye ve puri koshish karte hai ki janata ko jaankaree na mili yaa jaanboojhkar galat soochna dete hai
 His experience is no different
 payalat ne mumbai kii shrenee 3 ke instrumental landing system (ielas) ke har barish main bekaar ho jane ke sambandh main likhe gaye dheron shikayati patron ke kooday ke dabbe main phenke jane kii baat yaad karte hue bataaya, ''dijisie shikaayat ko itane din tak dabaa detii he ki log harkar maamle ko chhod dete hai
 “there is no use of applying ILS if it is not available to help you fly in misty skies during the rainy season
 air india ke ek anbhavi payalat kaa kahana he ki ''agar hamaare niyam or isieo ke dishanirdesh lagu kar die jaaen to bharat ke 90 fisadi hawaondde band ho jaaenge
 Our job is to see how far the aircraft flew, the safety and the management decide
 ” unhone haal main haj ke liye thasathas bhari airbas e-330 kii srinagar se saudi arab kii udaanon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ''ho saktaa he rajnatik taur par jammu or dilli ke liye yah sahi ho, lekin air india or dijisie kii ore se yah khatarnaak or gaiyr-jimmedaarana faisla tha
 Ranganathan says the DGCA, running on a dual policy, is blindfolded and wants to make a clean escape by calling it a 'lapse' or bypassing the damage caused by crashes in planes
 haalanki mishra isse sahamat nahin
 The regulator has put many such lapses in the list of accidents on the ICAO website
 (box dekhen)
 Air safety experts have warned that repeated incidents, such as dgca's negligence in taking action, may impact international ratings of Indian aviation
 america fedral aviation administration bharat ko shrenee ek se nichali shrenee do main lagbhag daalane hi vaali thi jiskaa nateeja hota ki hindustani vimaanon ko zyada oonche beemaa premium bharne padate, saath hi antarrashtriya udaanon ke vistaar main roak laga di jaati

 The controversy over the ongoing spiritual university in Vijay Vihar, Delhi, took a new turn after more than a month, in which the Delhi Police's top officers, along with the entire contingent, after the Delhi High Court order located the Vijay Vihar in Rohini Baba reached the ashram of Virendra Dev Dixit

 It is the spiritual university of Baba Virendra Dev Dixit, located in Vijay Vihar area of rohini, Delhi, where it is claimed that the women men who come to Baba's shelter here are imparted to God by giving them knowledge of spirituality

 raman singh jashpur ke us gaanv main pahunche jiske sapoot ne sukama hamale main apane praanon kii aahuti di he
 Chief Minister Raman Singh, who reached the home village of Dhaurasand, district-jashpur, martyred soldier in the Naxalite attack, late Banmali Yadav, informed the martyr's wife to be made Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI)
 unhone burqapal main naksali hamale main shahid jawan banmali yadav kii patni jiteshwari yadav or parijanon se mulaakaat kar apni samvednaaen prakat kii
 The Chief Minister said that under the special case the martyr Banmali Yadav's wife will be given compassionate appointment in the post of Assistant Sub Inspector in Chhattisgarh Police by the state government
 rajya shashan dwaara shahid banmali yadav ke parivaar ko 28 lakh rupee kii aarthik sahaayta dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 To provide irrigation facility for farming to the family of martyr Banmali, solar pump has been approved under the Solar Sujala Scheme
 shahid parivaar kii jarurat evam maang ke anusaar 29 april ko bor khanan karaayaa gaya he
 Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Rs 2 lakh 68 thousand has been sanctioned for the repair of wells and land improvement for the family of martyr Late Banmali Ram
 shahid parivaar kii madad ke liye jashpur jila prashasan ke adhikariyon dwaara apni swechha se apni vetan kii raashi se 3 lakh 50 hajaar rupee ekatrit kar shahid banmali yadav kii suputree kumari khushboo ke naam se fiks diposit bhartiya state bank jashpur mukhya shakha main jamaa kara diya gaya he
 On the way, Chief Minister Raman Singh told the families and villagers of the martyr present on the occasion that the martyrdom of the soldiers killed in the Sukma attack will not go in vain
 naksaliyon ko iskaa munhtod jawaab milegaa, bas aap intjaar kiijie
 Apart from Huma Qureshi, the show also stars actor Vivek Oberoi and director Omung Kumar
 set par pahunchane ke baad sabhi jaj bacchon jaisaa vihayb karne lagate hai
 After all, why not, to be with children one has to become like them
 haal hi main set par kuch aisa hua ki har koi hairaan sa rah gaya
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat and Padman will no longer clash at the box office
 darasal, donon filmon ke nirmaataaon ne aapasi sahmati se aisi bhidnt se bachane kaa rasta nikaal liya he
 The makers of Padman are set to release their film in February
 mumbai main ek press conference main sanjay lila bhansaali kii maujuudagi main khud akshay kumaar ne isaki jaankaree di
 Earlier there was discussion that Akshay is adamant to release the film on the same date
 aaie jaanate hai kin vajahon se 25 janvari ko relies hone vaali pedman kii date aage bad gai he
 
 
 
 # 1) screens kaa bantwaradarasal, padmavat or akshay kumaar kii film pedman kii bhidnt se donon filmon ko nuksaan pahunch rahaa tha
 Padmavat is a grand film made in a huge budget (around 180 crores)
 relies kii ghoshnaa ke baad theatres main screen bantwaare main padmavat ke aage rahane kii ummid jataai ja rahi thi
 It is also natural to think of the subject of the film, the starcast and the environment around it
 trade exparts kii bhi raay main donon filmein relies hotin to theatres ke 65 pratishat screens padmavat ko hi milte
 Padman will not clash with Padmavat, now Akshay's film # 2 will be released on February 9) The film's starcast and Bhansali Signaturepadmavat's starcast are also a big reason
 pedman kii tulana main yah thodaa aage he
 The film stars Deepika Padukone, Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh
 shahid kapur ko chhod den to teenon kaa box offis par trek record bahut behtareen rahaa hai
 Their pairing with Rasleela and bajirao-mastani has shown magic at the box office
 duusari ore bhansaali signechar kii filmon ne darshakon par kamaal kaa asar daalaa he
 However, Akshay Kumar also has a very good track record during the last two years at the box office
 lekin pedman main akshay ke alaava duusare sitaron kii waisi fain apil nahin he jaisi padmavat ke sitaron kii he
 Supreme Verdict: Padmavat will not be banned in any state, Governments should take care of law and order # 3) Padmavat is a family film
 darasal ection, imoshan, drama or aitihaasik fiction se bharpoor is film main manoranjan ke kai saare masaale maujod he
 This time there is a long weekend of four days
 darshakon main padmavat dekhnaa zyada pasand karte
 Actually, Padman's story is based on the tune of a man making sanitary napkins
 pedman kii kahani bhale hi ek soshal subject par aadhaarit he, lekin zyaadaatar madhya varg ke bhartiya samaaj ke liye abhi bhi parivaar ke saath sainitory pad par bahes karnaa yaa film dekhnaa badi baat he
 In the opinion of the trade expert, Padman would have been harmed because of this one reason of having trouble with Padmavat
 upi kaa mukhyamantri banane se pehle hi akhilesh yadav ne saaf kar diya tha ki is baar gundgardee nahin chalegi
 Party leaders were also given clear instructions
 lekin espi ke bahubali netaa to akhilesh kii baat is kaan se sunakar us kaan se nikaal de rahe hai or isiilie upi main jari he espi netaaon kii gundgardee
 It seems as if the government of the Samajwadi Party is not going to form a government of goons
 samaajawaadee party ke sarkaar banane se pehle hi upi main gundgardee kii baadh aa gai he
 mla's supporters bully in Moradabad
 police waalon ke saath khuleam kii badasluki
 The constable scrambles with Ronda, the inspector
 aspataal main bhartee consteble kii ye haalat hui he samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak kii gaadi se
 It is alleged that SP MLA Ashutosh Maurya was coming to Moradabad with his supporters from the vehicles, then his car hit the bike riding constable
 maukey par pahunche police daaroga or baaki consteble se bhi vidhayak ke samarthakon ne marpet kii
 At present, the police have registered a case of accident
 pratapgarh main bhi espi samarthakon kii gundgardee dekhne ko mili
 And it is alleged that supporters of Raja Bhaiya, close to Mulayam Singh Yadav
 raja bhaiya ke samarthakon ne bispi ummidavaar ke naukar ko buree tareeke se peet diya
 sp's MLA Raja Bhaiya is also a supporter responsible for this condition of hospitalized Amit
 bispi ummidavaar archana tiwari ke driver amit kaa aarope he ki jab wo nai kii dukaan par tha, to raja bhaiya ke samarthakon ne use buree tarah peeta
 The police have started the investigation by filing a report
 lekin sawaal ye he ki espi kii sarkaar banane se pehle jab gundgardee kaa ye haal he to sarkaar banane ke baad kya hoga, iskaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath has ordered the removal of the socialist name from all the schemes of the Akhilesh government
 ab uski jagah 'mukhyamantri' shabd likhaa jayega
 For example, 'socialist Ambulance Service' will now be 'chief Minister Ambulance Service'
 samaajawaadee party ne iskaa virodh kiya he
 He says that the term 'socialist' is not related to politics
 yah to desh kii samvidhan kii prastaavna main he
 Therefore, politics should not be done on this
 yogi sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad bahut sari roak lagaai he
 Among them, a ban is in the name of socialist, which was used in all the schemes of Akhilesh government
 upi sarkaar ke mantri or pravaktaa siddharth nath singh ne yogi ke is faisale ke bare main bataaya
 He said that under the schemes of the UP government, under the name 'samajwadi', he will move from there and will go ahead saying 'chief Minister's plan'
 akhilesh sarkaar main zyaadaatar yojanon ke naam ke aage samaajawaadee shabd judaa tha
 Even ambulances used to run under the name Samajwadi
 chunki iske liye centre se paisa mila tha isliye centre sarkaar ne bhi tab ambulance par samaajawaadee lafz likhane par aitraaj kiya tha
 Akhilesh had a socialist name in all his schemes
 jaise samaajawaadee ambulance seva, samaajawaadee smartphone yojana, samaajawaadee pension yojana, samaajawaadee swasthya beemaa yojana, samaajawaadee namak vitaran yojana, samaajawaadee kisaan beemaa yojana, samaajawaadee yuva swaarongaar yojana, samaajawaadee hathkargha bunakar pension yojana, samaajawaadee rojgaar yojana, samaajawaadee awaas yojana or samaajawaadee i-rickshaw yojana vagairah
 The comments yun to samaajwaad kaa parfyum se kabhi koi rishta nahin rahaa he lekin 15 march 2016 ko akhilesh yadav ne apni sarkaar ke 4 saal puure hone par 'samaajawaadee sugandh' naam se ek parfyum launch kar diya tha
 Then Akhilesh had said, 'I once said that the rivers are socialist because it is natural that people of every religion and caste live around it
 maine lapto kah diya samaajawaadee he kyonki vah bhedbhaav khatm karata he or jab internet lag jaae to har tarah kii information ko ek plateform par laane kaa kaam karata he
 This socialist fragrance will also end all forms of discrimination
 ” Governments of different parties in the country have kept the names of government schemes in the name of great men of their ideology
 misaal ke liye congress sarkaar ne indira awaas yojana, rajeev gandhi gramin vidyutikaran yojana, jawahar rojgaar yojana, nehru rojgaar yojana jaisi tamaam yojanaayen chalaayin
 In the current Modi government too, many schemes like “deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gramin Kaushal Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Shramev Jayate Program, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Advanced Agricultural Education Scheme were launched
 lekin samaajawaadee shabd hataane par samaajawaadee party ne etraz kiya he
 The Yogi government has imposed a lot of restrictions after coming to power
 unheen main ek roak samaajawaadee naam par he, jiskaa istemaal akhilesh sarkaar kii tamaam yojanaon main kiya gaya tha
 Siddharth Nath Singh, Minister and Spokesperson of UP Government, told about Yogi's decision
 unhone kaha ki, upi sarkaar kii jo bhi yojanaayen hai uske tahat jahaan 'samaajawaadee' naam laga he vahaan se wo hatega or uske aage 'mukhyamantri yojana' kehete hue chalegaa
 In the Akhilesh government, the word socialist was attached to the name of most of the schemes
 yahaan tak ki ambulance bhi samaajawaadee naam se chalati thi
 Since the money was received from the Center for this, the Central Government also objected to writing socialist words on the ambulance
 akhilesh kii tamaam yojanaon main samaajawaadee naam tha
 Such as Samajwadi Ambulance Service, Samajwadi Smartphone Scheme, Samajwadi Pension Scheme, Samajwadi Health Insurance Scheme, Samajwadi Salt Distribution Scheme, Samajwadi Kisan Bima Yojana, Samajwadi Yuva Swarozgar Yojana, Samajwadi Handloom Weaver Pension Scheme, Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana, Samajwadi Housing Scheme and Samajwadi e- Rickshaw Scheme, etc
 tippaniyan Though socialism has never had any relation with perfumes, but on 15 March 2016, Akhilesh Yadav launched a perfume named 'samajwadi Sugandha' on the completion of 4 years of his government
 tab akhilesh ne kaha tha, 'maine ek baar kah diya ki nadiyaan samaajawaadee hai kyonki swaabhaavik he ki har dharm-jati ke log uske aas-paas rahete hai
 i have called Lapto a socialist because it eliminates discrimination and when the internet is installed, it works to bring all kinds of information on a platform
 yah samaajawaadee sugandh bhi har tarah kaa bhedbhaav khatm kar degi
 " desh main alag-alag partiyon kii sarkarein apni vichaardhaara ke mahapurushon ke naam se sarkari yojanaon ke naam rakhti rahi hai
 For example, the Congress government ran various schemes like Indira Awaas Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme, Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana
 maujuuda modi sarkaar main bhi “deen dayaal upaadhyaay gram jyoti yojana, deen dayaal upaadhyaay gramin kaushal yojana, deen dayaal upaadhyaay shramev jayate kaarykram, deen dayaal upaadhyaay unnat krishi shiksha yojana jaisi tamaam yojanaayen chalaayin

 (IANS input ke saath) Shivamurti is a wonder in fiction
 aalochak or sampadak lagbhag aarope kii tarah kehete hai ki itnaa kam likhakar itani adhik khyaati! pathakon ke bich aisa apanaapa kitnon ko hasil hota he
 And when someone from Shivamurthy wanted to know about this, he replied, "I sometimes feel that i am not a writer
" kabhi likh diya to likh diya
 The writing of Gahe Bahagae is also some writing
 ” jivan or sahitya main yahi saadagi or sahajata shivamurti kii takat he
 Born in Kurang village in Sultanpur (uttar Pradesh) on March 11, 1950, Shivamurthy is a born story
 pehali kahani 13 saal kii umr main likh daali thi
 His Balsakha of village Jawar says that Shivamurthy used to narrate an incident in such a way that everything has come to the fore
 unka shuruaati jivan bada behad tha
 The father became independent as a monk, putting the burden of the house on his shoulders as a child
 kheti, padhai, naate-rishtedaari, rupayon kaa intjaam sab kuch shivamurti ke jimme
 The fair market was sold and even sold bullets of strength
 jivan ke sangharsh ne unhen gadha
 Shivamurthy is an outstanding creator of Dalit, women and peasant consciousness
 savarnavaad ke shikanje main chatpataate janajivan se unka kadam-kadam par sabaka padaa tha
 On the basis of caste, he suffered the suffering of people going to Duryeya, Latiyya
 shivamurti kaa dalit, stri, ki saan vimarsh jivan ke anany anubhavon se aakaar letaa he
 It was from these experiences that the narrative creations left their permanent mark
 unki kahaniyaan hai kasaibada, akaldand, siri upama jog, bharat natyam, tiria charittar, kaser kasturi or khwaja o mere pir
 And the novels are Trishul, Tarpan and Last Jump
 shivamurti kii rachanaaen charitra pradhan hai
 That is why their characters remain in our memory
 tiria charittar ne to hindi sansar main bhuuchaal laa diya tha
 The sight of his father-in-law on Vimli
 duraachaar ke baad vimali par hi doshaaropan or panchayat kaa faisla ki tikuli lagane kii jagah par garam kalchhul se daaga jayega
 And then filtering
 
 
 kalchhul khaal se choote hi patohun kaa chitkaar kalejaa faad detaa he
 Shivamurthy's intervention in the novel is also notable
 sampradayikta ko centre main rakhkar rachaa gaya trishul, badalte dalit yatharth ko vyakhyayit karata tarpan or aatmahatya karte kisaanon kii sachaaiyaan bataata aakhri chalaang
 It is said that everything should be in the composition, but if there is no courage, then the composition is lost
 tarpan kaa piyaare savarnon ke saath chal rahe jhagade main jail jane se batch saktaa he magar vah apane vakil ko yah kahkar sannaate main daal detaa he ki “mujhe jail janaa he
 Atonement is made by eating jail bread
 is paap kaa praayshchit ki kaan poonch dabaakar itane dinon tak un logon kaa jor julm sahataa rah gaya
 “many women have a hand in making Shivamurthy a person and a writer
 inamen bhi baalasakhaa sivakumari or jeevansangini sarita kaa khaas haath he
 Sivakumari of Bedi, who used to dance and sing, helped Shivamurthy in the struggle step by step
 sarita ne unhen padhai ke prati sachet banaae rakhaa
 Shivamurthy never thought that so much discourse is in fashion then i should take a franchise too
 vidhivat shuru hue stri vimarsh se bahut pehle unki k haniyaan hastkshep karti hai
 Apart from fabricated dalit discourse, a composition like tarpan makes anyone think
 sachaai yah he ki aam aadmi ke sukh-dukh ko “activist kathakaarya kii tarah samajhane or pannon par utaarne vaale shivamurti par pathakon kaa bharosa hi unki uplabdhi he
 After the formation of Yogi Adityanath government, Saharanpur area is engulfed in the fire of ethnic violence
 iske baad yahaan ke teen gaanvon ke 180 dalit pariwaron ne buddha dharm apanaaya he
 In view of the sensitivity of the case, the local administration is stepping up
 bhim army ke sansthaapak ko police talash rahi he
 Despite this, the organization has released an audio message on social media, appealing to supporters to gather at Delhi's Jantar Mantar on 21 May
 is ghatnakram ke maddenjar ajtak kii team ne rupadi, kapurpur or ighari gaanvon kaa daura kiya
 The families here have declared conversion
 'ladakar lenge haq'kapurpur gaanv ke daliton main haalia vaakyon ko lekar gussa saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 One such Dalit woman, Pushpa, says, 'the women who went wrong with Shabirpur were also our daughters-in-law
 jab hamen hamaara haq nahin mil rahaa to ham kya karen?' puspa or uske saathi gaanvvaale is baat se inkaar karte hai ki unpar dharm parivartan ke liye kisi tarah kaa dabaav tha
 Like Pushpa, Maina Burman of Kapoorpur also says that she has converted her religion in Kabirpur village to protest against the excesses of Dalit women on May 5
 jab maina se poocha gaya ki dharm badalane se unhen haq kaise hasil hoga to unka jawaab tha ki wo ladakar apana haq lenge
 Both women also denied the Bhima Army being behind the conversion
 pahchaan hi nahin, naam bhi badlailaake ke daliton ne naa sirf hindu dharm choda he balki apana sarnem tak badal liya he
 In Kapoorpur, 23-year-old Manoj is cutting hair
 wo bhi dharm parivartan karne vaale logon main shaamil hai
 He said, 'we have converted by will
 hamaare kai bhaaiyon ke ghar jalaae gaye or gundgardee kii gai
 The police administration did not take any action
 ' manoj kii tarj par gaanv ke baaki yuva bhi daliton par ho rahe atyaacharon se aahat hai
 Most of these youth are supporters of Bhima Army
 ighari, rupadi or kapurpur ke dalit yuvaaon kii maane to police unhen meeting kii ijaajat nahin detii or unhen jabaran gaanv chhodane par majaboor kiya ja rahaa he
 In the villages, Ravidas temple built in the Gunjarupadi village of Lord Buddha can be seen with the banner and posters of Bhima Army
 yahaan ke log mandiron main ab bhagwaan buddha kii jai-jayakaar kar rahe hai
 Most of the Dalits of the village openly support the Bhima Army
 yahaan dharm parivartan karne vaale logon main shaamil roopa ne kaha, 'ham se kisi ne nahin kaha
 We ourselves have changed our religion
 kyonki hamaare bahan-bhaaiyon par atyaachaar ho rahe hai
 According to Roshan of this village, "what will we do when our children are being oppressed?" In Hinduism we find no place to sit, we are tortured
 isse aahat hokar hamane buddha dharm apanaaya he
 Dalit outcry The Dalits of the three villages allege that the Dalits, who are victims of violence, are not being compensated appropriately
 dalit yuvakon par behad gambhir aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Local Dalits believe that Dalit youth are being implicated in false cases
 haalanki sthaneey police prashasan is baat se inkaar kar rahaa he
 Not only this, despite the identification of those responsible for the violence against Dalits, no action has been taken on them
 police kaa rukhmaamle kii sanjidagi ko bhaanpate hue saharanpur ke diaiji jeke shahi ne dharm parivartan par local intelligence unit se report talab kii he
 However, he was not ready to say anything on camera
 police adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki unhone jarurat se zyada sanyam dikhaaya he
 No innocent person needs to be scared but the perpetrators of violence will not be spared
 ilaake ke eyesaspi se jab bhim army ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'is sanghathan kaa ab tak koi record nahin he
 Therefore, it would not be right to say something formally about it
 sari hinsa ko ek arajak shaks ne lead kiya
 This accused not only incited the mob to sabotage but also tried to spoil the atmosphere

 sangharsh-kisi cheez kii yaad dilaataa ek shabd, jise aaj tak paribhaashit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Kolkata as the nursery of the revolution was such a farce that survived for 50 years - gradually turning the idiom of worship of "gun barrel" into a mystic call of "ma, Mati, Manush" It was long and enough time
 bengali hone kaa arth sanathan acroshit rahanaa hota tha
 Irritability and anxiousness combine with countless cups of sweet tea, inexpensive cigarettes, and natural disinterest in world success makes it an ideal mix
 ek bhadra bengali ke liye apane pyaare shahar kii deevaaron par mache 'sangharsh' kii utsavi hode kaa aks hona aprihaary tha
 Those of other opinion had no way of going outside

 Kolkata had become famous as a city from which everyone was ready to flee
 salbhar pehle pashchim bengal ne tay kiya ki use is mahaan bangla sahmati ke paimaanon ko kuch durust karnaa he
 After 34 years, this state voted against the Left Front and replaced it with a grassroots leader
 vidambnaa hi kahenge ki uskaa pasandida sur bhi ''sangharsh'' se judaa hua hona hi tha
 After Subhash Chandra Bose disappeared and became a legacy, it was for the first time that Bengal expressed such confidence in any one person
 'party' se 'didi' tak pahunchaa yah badlaav mahaj baari chunavi ulatpher nahin tha
 It was a symbol of a great brainstorm, the result of which is yet to be realized
 mamata banerjee ke kolkata main aane vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko jo cheez sabase pehle chaunkaaegi, vah yah ki yah shahar samaan gati se bhartiya shaharikaran kaa pratik banataa ja rahaa he
 In Kolkata in the past, its identity was different from the rest of Kolkata because of its malevolence - congestion, kitchen, inhuman life crawling on the streets, sudden stoppages, stench from the mountains of garbage, open manholes, power cuts and, of course, city walls
 But the great tableau of 'struggle'
 yah ek aisa kolkata tha, jahaan madar terresa sant hi ho sakati thim, vipannataa main saundarya talashne vaale radical cinemetographer hi paidaa ho sakate the or gori chamadi vaale parkhi paryaton kii vinashlila main ratisukh le sakate the

 "now it is gruesome or reassuring, but it has nothing to do with the fact that Kolkata is no longer an urban nightmare
 kam-se-kam ausat madhyavargeey shahriyon ke liye yah shahar ab rahane ke lihaaj se kaaphi aakarshak he
 The contribution of the new Chief Minister in this is not much

 The improvement in the condition of roads, the extensive network of metros and the emergence of affordable flats across the city like a mushroom is bringing Kolkata back to normal, which is at least new to it and focused on the restoration of civic order
 trinmul ke saansad derek o'bryan kii maane to prashasan ne 14,000 logon ko naukari de rakhi he

 Last year, a restaurant of Bengali Fusion Food opened in Beliganj, South Kolkata

 It is free from paintings on the wall and always close

 These changes were visible in the last years of the Left Front
 mamata ke aane se or kolkata ko landan bana dene kii unki atirecopurna ghoshnaa se bas us rujhaan ko gati mili he
 For five decades, Kolkata continued to flow in reverse
 aaj vah jabardast utsaah se sahajata ko gale laga rahaa he or yah utsaah sankramak rog kii tarah failata ja rahaa he
 Historian Rajat Kant Ray, former vice-chancellor of visva-bharati University and a retired professor of the new edition of Presidency College, Presidency University, says, "this is almost the same freedom as the end of the civil war in Russia, that of Stalin's occupation in 1919 and 1927

 Ever since the weakness of the Left was first revealed in 2009, Bengali creativity has been able to express itself in a more liberal way
 jaisaaki pichley 50 saalon ke dauraan kabhi bhi nahin hua
 The decline of the Left has nothing to do with Mamata's arrival, as much as the elevation of Bengali consciousness
 lekin isamen koi shaq nahin ki rajnatik asampruktata kaa nayaa vaataavaran isamen prerak kii bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 Gauri Chatterjee, who had spent life in Kolkata and until recently editor of a magazine on performing arts, says, "what is visible is the change of generations
 '' ve filmon va theatre main ''samakaleen vaishvik samvednaaon vaale angreji madhyam se shikshit bengaaliyon'' ke pravesh ko ahm maanati hai
 Inspired by subtitled European films, there is no burden on this new generation of actors beyond the generation of burden of splitting pain
 yahaan tak ki 'sarokaaron' ko dhone kaa boj bhi nahin he
 Anik Dutta's houseful film Bhooter Bhabishyat (future of the Past) is being told in the best of Tollywood films, which raises the current themes without any hesitation and puts Kolkata and Calcutta together
 is film ke mukhya nayak parambrat chattopadhyaay bangla prishthbhumi par bani bollywood film 'kahani' main bhi the, jo ittefaq se ruthvik ghatak ke bete hai

 Bengal is perhaps the only part of India, where intellectuals are not only taken seriously, but they also consider themselves politically decisive
 ab coffee house ke ve din lad gaye, jahaan baithkar swayambhu buddhijivi bal kii khaal nikaalte the, vishisht varg kii khilli udaate the or apane haashiye par hone kaa dambh bharte the
 The credit for this must go to the fast-paced Bengali news channels, whose arrival has now brought the atmosphere of the coffee house to the studio and which is showing interesting results
 nandigram or singoor main makapa kii jyadatiyon ne buddhijiviyon ko prakaash main laane kaa kaam kiya
 He certainly played a big role in challenging the legitimacy of the Left Front and creating the 'muktidatri' image of Mamata
 apane str par mamata ne aise buddhijiviyon ko rijhaayaa, unhen protsaahit kiya
 Although his first choice has always been Tollywood stars with popular appeal
 haalanki in buddhijiviyon ne badale main mamata ke 'poribartan' vaale naare main gambhirtha kaa chhaunkaa laga diya
 Clearly, no nexus between a chaotic and equally stubborn leader and ideological person cannot last very long
 satta main aane ke salbhar ke bheetar mamata ne kai aise logon ko naaraaz kar diya he, jinhone poribartan kaa naaraa lagaaya tha
 The Park Street rape scandal and his arrest by a lecturer at Jadhavpur University have brought this tension to a level of breakdown
 jo kabhi muktidatri thi, use fasivadi qaraar diya gaya or madhyam aakaar ke virodh pradarshnon se lekar tivi studio tak uski hai-hai hui
 The administration's barbaric baton sparked protests sparked by militant leftists living illegally along the side of the bypass, causing international celebrity intellectual Noam Chomsky to impress as usual and also make a statement against the Mamata Banerjee government
 buddhijiviyon ke virodh kaa parinaam doharaa rahaa he
 First, some intellectuals retreated under pressure from their peers and returned to their safe corners
 doosraa, buddhijiviyon kii jamaat do khemon main bant gai- ek jo mamata ko aattaayi shaasha ke rup main dekh rahi thi or duusari bidyajan, yani jin par sarkari buddhijivi hone kaa thappa laga he
 Those who believe that Mamata should be given some more time
 is puure prakaran main sabase dilachasp baat, jo mamata kii halki chhavi ko lekar logon kii dharna ke vipareet bhi jaati he, vah yah he ki unhen un vyaktiyon kaa vishwaas hasil he, jo unke raaj kaa istemaal karke sarkari sansthaanon kaa shuddhikaran karnaa chaahate hai

 The restoration of Bengal was first heard in 1972, when Siddharth Shankar Ray plagued the CPM in a blatant violation of human rights
 uske baad se bengal kai baar khud ko behaal kar chukaa he or har baar gum-phirakar funs jane kaa gavaah bhi rahaa he
 Will Mamata's exercise be any different? It is not practical to expect any immediate result
 mamata ne niveshkon kii ek baithak main khud hi apana majaak bana liya tha, jab ve upasthit logon kii upasthiti jaanchane lageen or yah poochne lageen ki ve apana paisa bengal main lagaayenge yaa nahin
 After what happened to the Tatas in Singur, it is unlikely that the manufacturing industry will give first preference to this state

 The number of such people can be reduced, but their ability to get stuck in the road is enough
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki aarthik vruddhi kaa batan dabaate hi sarkaar ko baari rajnatik keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 Harsh Neotia of the Bengal Ambuja Group, the largest investor in the state, is impressed when he warns against comparing Kolkata with Delhi or Bengaluru
 kolkata main dher sari shishtataa or samskruti se labarej jivan kii gunvattta pehle aati he, mahatvakanksha baad main
 In this sense, in a competitive world, this city is a great place to settle down after retiring from the job - cheap labor, modern health services and a loving environment
 kolkata kii shuruyaat east india company kii sabase dur sthit videshi vyapaar chaowkee ke rup main hui thi
 Today, only businesses and related businesses are dying in this city
 iske baavjood aazaadee ke baad har mukhyamantri ne udyogon ko us janata ke bich badhaava dene kii koshish kii, jise swaabhaavik taur par hode or bhagdaud se parhez he
 Mamta does not understand the historical process of capitalism, nor does she know the story of classical Marxism, which is a memorial to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee

 It should be no surprise then that the torch that shows the way to this city seeking its soul is still in the hands of Rabindranath Tagore, not Karl Marx

 com / thuwb8ojwh Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari says that if the public wants good roads then toll will have to be paid
 darasal, mangalvaar ko nitin gadakari loksabhaa main sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay ke fundon kii maangon ko lekar sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Meanwhile, in response to a question, he said that the toll cannot be closed for a lifetime
 kam zyada ho saktaa he
 Gadkari further said that i am the father of toll
 agar aapako acchhee sevaayen chahie to keemat chukaani padegi kyonki sarkaar ke paas paryaapt fund nahin he
 Nitin Gadkari also said that in the Modi government, projects worth Rs 17 lakh crore were awarded in the areas of road, shipping and water resources, but there was no corruption of one rupee
 gadakari ne kaha, ‘‘main sadan ko vishwaas dilaanaa chahta hum ki pradhanmantri ne buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas ke liye jo praathamikta tay kii thi uske bahut achche nattejey aae hai
 According to Gadkari, progress in the highway and building construction has doubled
 yah bahut badi pragati he
 Every project is a priority for us
 ham use puraa karenge
 Kamakshak Transport Minister, who is working on 22 Green Expressway, told that we are building 22 Green Expressway
 inamen se dilli-mumbai expresve ek he
 Gadkari said, “the delhi-mumbai route is a part of the Green Express Highway network being developed across the country
 yah gudgaanv se shuru hokar savai madhopur, alvar, ratlam, jhabua, vadodara se hokar mumbai jayega
 According to Gadkari, the cost of freight through the green highway will be reduced as it will be operated by electric systems like trains
 gadakari ne bataaya ki america ke san francisco, germany or sweden aadi ke tarj par desh main bhi maal dhulaai kaa anokhaa rasta taiyaar hoga
 However, land acquisition is a problem
 nitin gadakari ne bataaya ki kaha ki sarkaar ne pehle se rukii hui pariyojnaon se sambandhit 95 fisadi samasyaayein khatm kii hai
 This avoided banks having more than Rs 3 lakh crore of npas (non-performing assets)
 gujarat ke chunavi ran main ek taraf jahaan mukhya vipakshi dal congress apane paramparaagat muslim vot ko sidline kar soft hindutv kii taraf badhati najar aa rahi he, vahiin duusari taraf muslim netaa bijepi kii taraf aakarshith ho rahe hai
 Now that the election date has been announced, there is a huge tussle between the two parties for getting tickets
 bijepi kii baat kii jaae to uske apane netaaon ke alaava muslim netaa bhi bijepi ke tikat par ladane kaa daawa thok rahe hai
 There are also reports that Muslims are competing to get a BJP ticket
 khaskar jin siton par muslim vot nirnaayak kii bhoomika main he, vahaan muslim netaa bijepi ke tikat par maidan maarane kii jugat main hai
 The increase in representation in the civic elections is mainly a contest between the Congress and the BJP in Jagujrat
 1995 ke baad congress soobe kii satta tak nahin pahunch pai he
 On the other hand, the bjp's graph has steadily increased
 yahi vajah rahi ki 2010 ke sthaneey nikaay chunaav main bijepi ne apane tikat par muslim ummidavaar utaare or unhone behatar pradarshan kiya
 After which the Muslims hoped to get assembly tickets, however, they got a setback in the 2012 assembly elections and no Muslim candidate got a single ticket
 iske baad 2015 ke nikaay chunaav main bhi muslimon ne bijepi se tikat paakar apana paracham laharaaya
 Around 350 candidates won elections on BJP tickets
 yahi vajah he ki aagaamee disambar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi se tikat paane ko muslim bekaraar najar aa rahe hai
 It is also believed that the BJP can break the ritual of not giving tickets to Muslims
 jin siton par muslim vot nirnaayak bhoomika main hai, vahaan se muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat die ja sakate hai
 According to claims media reports on these seats, Muslim leaders are expected to get tickets from Jamalpur, Vejalpur, Vagra, Wankner, Bhuj and Abdasa
 ye bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki jamalpur ke maujuuda nirdaleey parshad imran khedawala kesaria pahan kar jamalpur seat se congress ke khilaaf taal thok sakate hai
 The number of Muslims in this seat is more than 60 percent
 haalanki, bijepi se puraane samay se jude osman ghanchi bhi is seat se daavedaari pesh kar rahe hai
 BJP has fielded a Muslim candidate only once, after 1980, bjp's history has come only once when it has nominated a Muslim candidate for the Gujarat Assembly elections
 1998 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ne ek muslim ko tikat diya tha, jo chunaav nahin jeet paae the
 While the BJP government was formed in the state
