 They also say that when Nitish has made up his mind to break the alliance, what is the point of meeting him now
 nandakishor yadav ne kaha, nitish kumaar ne baithak ke liye bulaayaa tha
 
 
 Nitish has put some conditions in the name of PM, but is mudde par baat karne ke liye ham adhikrut nahin hai or bijepi alaakaman hi is par baat karegaa, isliye hamane baat karne se inkaar kiya
 Nandkishore Yadav also said that whoever makes an alliance, will have to be angry with the people of Bihar

 He said that Nitish Kumar made his stand clear in this matter on Friday, on which a final decision will be taken by today or tomorrow
 is mudde par charchaa ke liye nitish kumaar ne patna sthit apane awaas par shuukravaar ko jediu kor group ke saath baithak kii
 Nitish has called a meeting of all JDU mlas today to decide on the alliance
 is baithak main sharad yadav bhi maujuud rahenge
 The comments shuukravaar ko katihaar jila main apni seva yatra puri kar patna laute nitish se yah puche jane par ki bijepi ke saath 17 saal puraani unki dosti kya ab tuutane vaali he, unhone kaha, ab jo halaat hai, ve kathin hai or is kathin halaat main kya karnaa he, yah faisla karnaa he
 Narrating the present situation in the shape of a lion, Nitish said, "dua pray to live, do medicine to die, this is the reason for misery
" bijepi kii ab koshish yah he ki gathbandhan tuutane ke halaat main bhi uske jediu se sambandh bane rahen
 This is the reason why BJP is constantly avoiding its role in breaking the alliance
 jediu ke netaaon ke kade bayanon ke baavjood bijepi netaa bihar ke janadesh kaa sammaan karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 On Friday, when Nitish Kumar was asked whether the 17-year-old BJP-JDU alliance will break
 to unhone kaha ki halaat bahut kharaab hai or in halaaton main kya karnaa chahie, ye sab milakar baithak main tay karenge
 These leaders have said that they have not received any instruction from Delhi high command in this regard and this is their personal decision
 saath hi inkaa kahana he ki jab nitish ne gathbandhan todane kaa man bana liya he, to unase ab milane kaa kya matlab he
 Nandkishore Yadav said, Nitish Kumar called for the meeting
 
 
 nitish ne piem ke naam par kuch sharten rakhi hai, lekin We are not authorized to talk on this issue and the BJP high command will only talk on this, so we refused to talk
 nandakishor yadav ne yah bhi kaha ki jo bhi gathbandhan karegaa, use bihar kii janata kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padegaa
 BJP and JDU are set to split after Narendra Modi was made the head of the campaign committee in the next Lok Sabha elections and according to sources, it may be formally announced on Sunday by Nitish's party

 It has to be decided
 nitish ne vartmaan paristhiti ko ek sher kii shakl main bayaan karte hue kaha, dua karte hai jeene kii, dawa karte hai marane kii, dushavaari kaa sabab yahi he
 bjp's effort now is to keep its relations with JDU even in the event of a coalition breakdown
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi lagaataar gathbandhan tuutane main apni bhoomika se batch rahi he
 Despite stern statements by JDU leaders, BJP leaders are talking about honoring Bihar's mandate
 shuukravaar ko jab nitish kumaar se yah poocha gaya ki kya ab bijepi-jediu kaa 17 saal purana gathbandhan tut jayega
 So he said that the situation is very bad and what should be done in these conditions, they will decide together in the meeting

 The infighting has started over Assam Governor PB Acharya's statement about Hindus and Hindustan
 acharya ke bayaan par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue emm netaa asadaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki yah durbhagyapurna he

 ' Rahul Gandhi is cashing in on the anger over demonetisation and especially GST
 iske sahare wo piem modi par rajnatik hamale kar rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has got new political ammo on the issue of business of Amit Shah's son
 is raajnneeti or andolanon ke bich bijepi ke liye gujarat bada chalange ban gaya he
 In Gujarat, the movement has been going on for the last three years in both Patel and a large section of OBC, who have been BJP voters
 - bijepi kii asli chunauti 12% patel vot or 50% obisi vot main andar naaraazgi saadhane kii he
 The bjp's problem in Gujarat is also that Narendra Modi is not active in Gujarat, and the Gujarat leadership seems divided
 - gujarat main khaastaur par jiesti ko lekar se bijepi ke khilaaf maahaul banataa hua dikhaa he
 - The government made many concessions on GST just before the election, but it is difficult to say how much impact they will have
 haalanki congress kii bhi apni chunautiyaan hai
 Shankar Singh Vaghela, a big face of the Congress, left the party a few months before the election
 sanghathan ke str par bijepi or congress main ab bhi bada antar he
 - Congress's challenge is how much will it be able to redeem resentment in Gujarat in terms of votes? - Will Rahul Gandhi's aggressive campaign in Gujarat make the atmosphere against the BJP an atmosphere for the Congress? - Regarding the Congress state leadership in Gujarat There are also questions, because no leader was able to win his seat in the last election? - Will the caste equation help the Congress and the bjp's traditional Will the urban areas be able to make a dent? - Will the business class which has been the traditional vote bank of BJP, will the Congress be able to make a dent in it? bhartiya cricket captain mahendra singh dhoni ne biking ke apane junun ke liye kuch samay nikaala or chennai superkings ko champiens lig tii-20 kaa doosraa khitaab dilaane ke ek din baad yahaan buddha antarrashtriya circuit par biking kaa jalawaa bikherte dikhaai die
 The presence of cricketers always leads to chaos and the sight was not different even on India's only Formula One track
 dhoni yahaan 'bike utsav' ko promot karne ke liye pahunche lekin jaise hi vah trek par pahunche, darshak unki jhalak paane ko betaab ho gaye
 After seeing a variety of 'vintage' and 'sports' bikes, Dhoni joined a group of riders to take a lap on the track while sitting on the Yamha R-1

 They now have close to 30 bikes
 dhoni ne heritage gairaaj main zyaadaatar samay bitaayaa jisamen 100 saal puraani bike bhi thim
 He said, 'the experience here was fantastic
 main kuch bike se najar nahin hataa paa rahaa tha
 i wanted to show people how my bikes are different from their bikes

 ' bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne upie sarkaar or congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki congress ko madhya pradesh main hua vikaas nahin dikhataa, use sirf kursi dikhti he, kyonki usne kursi brands chashma jo pahan rakhaa he
 Addressing an election meeting in Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, Modi said that more development has been done in Madhya Pradesh during the BJP rule in the last 10 years than the Congress did not develop in its 50 years of rule
 janata ko to yah vikaas dikhataa he, magar congress or dilli main baithi sarkaar ko nahin dikhataa
 He only sees the chair

 Inflation has not decreased, and has increased
 is par pradhanmantri manmohan singh se lekar congress kii madam tak jawaab dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Referring to the statements made by Congress leaders and Union Ministers regarding inflation, Modi said that these leaders are not familiar with the reality and statements are being made to hide their failure
 modi ne congress par aarope lagaaya ki vah chunaav main loklubhaavan vaade kar gumraah karti he, magar use puraa nahin karti, jabaki bhaajapa vikaas karti he
 The White House has sought an explanation from US presidential candidate Mitt Romney for his statement in which he supported Jerusalem as the capital of Israel against US policy
 apni teen deshon kii yatra ke dauraan romany ne beete ravivaar yerusalem main ek bhaashan diya
 In this speech, Romney supported the city, calling it the 'capital of Israel'
 yah yahudee desh to israel ko apni rajdhani maanata he lekin antarrashtriya samudaay dwaara ise sweekaar nahin kiya gaya he
 Romney's statement was immediately dismissed by Palestinian mediator Saib Irakat, describing it as "unacceptable" and "harmful to American interests in the region"
 iske baad hi romany ne dobaaraa vivaadaaspad bayaan die to america raashtrapati obama ke daftar white house ne unase unke bayanon par spashtikaran kii maang kii
 Romney had said that Israeli 'culture' contributed to the country's economic progress
 romany ke is bayaan ko irakaat ne ‘nasleey’ qaraar diya
 White House spokesman Josh Ernest said in reference to Romney's statement, 'when you go to such a sensitive area of the world, your statements are interpreted and analyzed very closely to make sense
 antarrashtriya manch par hone par aapako is chunauti se jujhna padataa he
 ' pichley kai dinon se bijepi se alag raah chalane vaali shivasena ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa samarthan kiya he
 However, an instruction has also been given in this support
 shivasena ne piem modi ke is bayaan kaa samarthan kiya he ki samvidhan meraa dharmagranth he
 The party has said that Bal Thackeray used to say the same, Modi is now following the same path
 modi ko di yah hidaayatshivasena ne apanemukhpatr saamanaamen lekh likhakar kaha he ki samvidhan yadi dharmagranth he to pradhanmantri ko uski bhoomika kaa vistaar kar desh ko dharm kii raajnneeti se baahar nikaalnaa chahie
 It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to expand the basic idea of this scripture
 siyaasi shah-maat ke kaaran dararsaamna ne party ne likhaa he ki jati or dharm main raajnneetik shah or maat ke khel ke kaaran desh kii ekta main daraar ai he
 For this reason, the fear of the dome of the constitution has collapsed
 desh kii janata ko is granth (samvidhan) par haath rakhkar court main shapath leni chahie, naa ki gita, quran yaa bible par haath rakhkar
 The Bharatiya Janata Party seemed to be benefiting from the debate on nationalism of the Indian Air Force in Balakot, Pakistan, before the general elections
 congress party ke netaaon kii taraf se bijepi ke netaaon ke daavon ko lekar puche gaye har sawaal ko sattadhari dal sena ke shaury par sawaal bataakar congress ko rashtravirohi tehra rahi thi
 Meanwhile, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has tried to focus the entire debate of nationalism vs
 nationalism, Modi vs
 Rahul, by focusing on rich vs
 poor by announcing minimum income guarantee scheme
 ab yojana ko lekar bijepi ke netaa or kendriya mantriyon kii taraf se puche gaye sawaal ko congress garib virdohi bataa rahi he
 Announcing the justice plan, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi can give money to the richest people of India, then the Congress party can give money to the poorest people of the country
 is lihaaj se rahul gandhi kii ranneeti pradhanmantri narendra modi ko amiron ke saath khadaa dikhaane kii he or congress party ko garibon kaa asli hitaishi bataane kii he
 a hallmark of this was seen at Rahul Gandhi's rally in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan on Tuesday where he said that we will open the doors of banks to small shopkeepers, small business people
 ham bank kii chaabi neerav modi, anil ambani se chhinakar aapke (garibon ke) haath main denge
 Addressing a public meeting in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress Party government will give 72000 rupees to the bank account every year to the 20 percent poorest people of India
 matlab 3
 The Congress party will show 60 lakh crore rupees by giving it to 5 crore poor families
 rahul ne kaha ki congress party ne 14 karod logon ko garibi se baahar nikaala tha, pichley 5 saal main narendra modi ne un sabko phir se garib bana diya
 15 lakhs were not found, 2 crore jobs were not available, farmers also did not get the loan waiver; And what you saved and kept in the house was taken away by Modi ji
 garibon kaa paisa amiron kii jeb main daalaa
 Arun Kumar, professor and economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University, says that how successful Congress Party's plan will be will be decided only after its implementation
 lekin ek baat ko tay he ki is ghoshnaa ne desh main amiri-garibi or asamanta kii bahes ko centre main laa diya he
 Which will result in better
 pro
 Arun Kumar says that a recent report came out stating that the 9 richest people have 55 percent wealth
 yah desh main asamanta kii gahari hoti khai ko dikhaata he ki hamaare desh main 150 arbapati hai, jo japan se bhi zyada hai
 While the capita income is 30 times more than that of Japan
 darasal, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi pichley paanch saal se pradhanmantri narendra modi ko amiron or bade udyogpatiyon kaa hitaishi bataate rahe hai
 Then whether it is against the 'suit boot ki sarkar' or to note demonetisation as 'fair and lovely' scheme
 rahul gandhi badi saavdhaanee se pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam bhagode aarthik apradhi neerav modi, mehul chokasee or vijay maalya ke saath jodate gaye
 Talk of PM Modi's relationship with big industrialists was the main focus of Rahul Gandhi's statement in every rally, every discussion
 to vahiin rahul gandhi ko sabase bada hathiyaar rafel vimaan saude main kathith gadabadi se mila
 In which the statement of the then French President François Hollande sharpened the edge of Rahul Gandhi's attack
 francwa oland ne francisi patrika ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki rafel saude main anil ambani kii company ko ofaset partner banane kii baat bharat kii taraf se kahi gai thi
 Taking advantage of this statement, Rahul Gandhi directly accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi that in order to benefit his close Anil Ambani, he made a new agreement by canceling the agreement under the UPA government
 rahul gandhi apni har raily, har sambodhan main rafel saude kaa zikr karte hue 'chaukeedaar chor he' kaa naaraa bhi lagaate or lagavate dikhe
 To counter the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai', Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the campaign 'main Bhi Chowkidar', then all Union ministers and BJP supporters put a watchman in front of his name
 pradhanmantri ke is abhiyaan ko khaasi safalataa bhi mili
 So Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi said in her Uttar Pradesh tour that the watchman is of the rich, someone has seen the watchman of the poor and the farmers
 rahul gandhi ne bhi is baat ko doharaate hue sriganganagar kii sabha main kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha main bhi chaukeedaar, lekin yah nahin bataaya ki kiske chaukeedaar hai
 Unemployed youth, farmers or Anil Ambani? The Lok Sabha elections are just beginning, but political agitation is at its peak
 jisamen congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi nyaay yojana kii ghoshnaa kar garibi, berogari ko raajnneetik bahes ke centre main laate dikh rahe hai
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen standing with select rich people
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki amir or garib do virgon kii bahes ko congress kis tareeke aam chunaavon ke aakhri charan tak barkaraar rakh sakati he
 Tapti said, "I came to know that that place was Markunda Ferry Ghat of Mundeshwari river at Parasura in Hooghly district

 He was later taken to the hospital and then discharged after treatment

 We are fortunate that that era has given us a priceless legacy as a republic

 Whatever we do, wherever we do, and whatever our goals are

 Those freedom fighters gave up everything for the country
 mahatma gandhi ke netritv main, ye mahaan senaanee, maatr rajnatik swatantraaa praapt karke santusht ho sakate the
 But he did not rest for a moment
 balki dugane utsaah ke saath samvidhan banane ke mahatvapurn kaary main puri nishtha ke saath jute gaye
 According to him, our Constitution was not only a basic law for our new nation, but a document of social change
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki hamaare samvidhan nirmaataa bahut doordarshee the
 He understood the importance and dignity of 'rule of law' and 'rule by law'

 Whatever we do, wherever we do, and whatever our goals are

 He said that innovative children form an innovative nation
 is lakshya ko paane ke liye hamen ek junun ke saath, jute janaa chahie
 In our education system, instead of memorizing and listening by rote, children should be encouraged to think and experiment in various ways
 hamane khadyann utpaadan main kaaphi badhotaree kii he, lekin abhi bhi kuposhan ko dur karne or prayek bachche kii thali main jaruri poshak tatv uplabdh karaane kii chunauti bani hui he

 dhanyavad Jai Hind! unhone kaha ki raashtra nirmaan karodon chote-bade abhiyaanon ko jodakar bana, ek sampoorn abhiyaan he
 Building the character of citizens, laying the foundation of good values by families, and eradicating blind faith and inequality from society are all a contribution towards nation-building
 jahaan betiyon ko, beton kii hi tarah, shiksha, swasthya or aage badhane kii suvidhaayen di jaati hai, aise samaan avasaron vaale parivaar or samaaj hi ek khushhaal raashtra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The government can implement laws and make policies to provide justice to women, but such laws and policies will be effective only when family and society will listen to the voice of our daughters
 hamen parivartan kii is pukaar ko sunanaa hi hoga 
 President Kovind said that it is the self-confident and forward-thinking youth who build a self-confident and progressive nation

 It is only on these that our expectations are guaranteed
 hamane sakshartaa ko kaaphi badhaayaa he; ab hamen shiksha ke daayre or badhaane honge
 Our aim should be to elevate the education system, and to expand its scope and to enable it to meet the challenges of 21st century digital economy, genomics, robotics and automation
 unhone kaha ki innovative bachche hi ek innovative raashtra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 To achieve this goal, we must gather together with a passion
 hamaari shiksha-pranali main, ratakar yaad karne or sunaane ke bajaay, bacchon ko sochane or tarah-tarah ke prayog karne ke liye protsaahit karnaa chahie
 We have increased food production significantly, but still the challenge of eliminating malnutrition and providing essential nutrients in the plate of each child remains
 yah hamaare bacchon ke shaareerik or maansik vikaas ke liye, or desh ke bhavishya ke liye, bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 President Kovind said that a vigilant nation is formed from the citizens who are vigilant at the level of the village and the city
 ham apane padosi ke nijee maamalon or adhikaron kaa sammaan karte hai
 While celebrating festivals, organizing protests or on any other occasion, let us take care of our neighbor's convenience
 kisi duusare naagarik kii garima or nijee bhaavana kaa uphaas kiye bina, kisi ke najariye se yaa itihaas kii kisi ghatana ke bare main bhi ham asahmat ho sakate hai
 Such liberal behavior is called brotherhood
 ni:swaarth bhaavana vaale nagarikon or samaaj se hi, ek ni:swaarth bhaavana vaale raashtra kaa nirmaan hota he
 Volunteer groups care for destitute people and children, and even homeless animals
 samudri taton jaise saarvajanik sthanon or nadiyon ko saaf rakhte hai
 More important things about the President's message: aise raashtra main sampann parivaar, apni ichha se, suvidha kaa tyaag kar detaa he
 Be it subsidized LPG today, or some other facility tomorrow
 taaki iskaa laabh kisi jaruratmand parivaar ko mil sake
 The spirit of giving is part of our age-old culture
 aaie, ham ise majboot banaaen
 Disciplined and ethical institutions create a disciplined and ethical nation
 aisi sansthaaen, anya sansthaaon ke saath, apane bhai-chaare kaa sammaan karti hai
 She maintains honesty, discipline and dignity in her work
 aisi sansthaaon main, vahaan kaam karne vaale logon kii nahin balki sanstha kii mahatta sabase upar hoti he
 Members of these institutions, as trustees of the countrymen, meet the expectations of their office
 bharat ke raashtra nirmaan ke abhiyaan kaa ek ahm uddeshy ek behatar vishwa ke nirmaan main yogadan dena bhi he
 a world that is full of social and mutual harmony and has a peaceful relationship with itself, and with nature
 yahi ‘vasudaiv kutumbakam’ kaa sahi arth he 
 This ideal has been inspiring us all for thousands of years
 isaki jhalak hamaare samvidhan ke mulyon main bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 Our society is based on these principles and this ideal we present to the world community as well
 yahi bhaavana ham pravasi bhartiya pariwaron ke vishay main bhi apanaate hai

 It is a crime of a whimsical and bizarre nature

 The most prominent complaint about the current economic slowdown of India can be made in two words: Unmatched decisions! At a time when the global economy entered its strongest phase of turn-taking since 2010, India was forced to take back-to-back policy decisions — demonetisation, the initial troubles of the Goods and Services Tax, and the reshaping of banks' debt
 Was thrown into the sad consequences of
 in faislon ne gharelu supplai chen ko kuch vakt ke liye tahas-nahas kar diya
 As soon as their impact fades, the global tide will lift India to a higher growth rate
 is bich sudhaaron ko jari rakhte hue kaarobaar karne kii laagat ko aasaan banane par dhyaan dena jari rakhana chahie, vahiin samaayojan kaa boj halkaa karne ke liye maudrik or rajkoshiya nitiyaan chote vakt kii raahat muhaiyaa karwaane vaali honi chahie
 So cutting policy interest rates, a far weaker currency, and tolerating more fiscal deficit in the current and next year is the time
 nijee nivesh kii buree haalat ko dekhte hue rajkoshiya vistaar kii niti kaa lakshya buniyadi dhaanche par kharch main badhotaree or nichle or madhyam aamadani ke awaason ke liye sabsidi hona chahie
 But when elections stand, some assistance can also be given to the farmers separately
 pehali najar main yah daleel pukhta lagati he, sivaae iske ki iskaa hakeekat se zyada lenaa-dena nahin he
 Now let's start with global growth
 2016 ke baad ke chah maheenon se hi vaishvik arthvyavastha main chahunmukhi chakree vruddhi dekhi ja rahi heru viksit arthvyavasthaaen khapat or nivesh donon ke lihaaj se puri takat se joardaar pradarshan kar rahi hai, jabaki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaen chaturaai ke saath ubarne main kaamyaab rahi hai
 Things are expected to improve in 2018
 euro jone or amorica donon rujhaanon se kahin zyada tej badhenge
 Underneath this cyclical upsurge is a global economy that is trapped in structural difficulties
 aarthik sankat ke baad se takreeban har jagah maapi gai utpaadakta main giravat ai he, tab jab kisi bhi jagah supplai yaa aapurti se jude sarthak sudhaar nadaarad hai
 Even the tax reforms in the US that have been so boasted can be expected to increase demand in the short term without increasing the medium-term supply
 aath saal ke vistaar ke baad kshamta par lagaataar zyada dabaav padane or utpaadakta ke apekshanusaar na badaae ke saath, aakhirkaar tankhwaahen badhengi, jo mudrasphiti ko or upar dhakel dengi or kendriya bainkon ko or zyada sakhti ke liye majaboor kar dengi
 Beyond developed economies, China is the only other source of global demand for goods
 haal hi main hui 19veen congress main sattadhari communist party ne aupchaarik taur par kabool kiya tha ki china ab kam aamadani vaali arthvyavastha nahin rah gaya, jo lakhon naukariyaan paidaa karne kii chunauti se ghira ho, balki vah badhati madhyam aamadani vaala desh ban chukaa he, jo jindagi ko or behatar banane ko lalayit he
 In 1981, Deng 'oping identified rising economic growth as the party's primary objective in place of class struggle
 phir agle teen dashakon tak prantiy or nichle str ke afasaron ne har mumkin tareeke se oonchi vruddhi hasil karne main puraa jor laga diya, bhale hi iske dushprinaam jhele
 Turning to the main reasons of Hindustan, the reverse effect of demonetisation and GST has been attributed to the slowdown of growth and bad debts
 isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki ye faisle uthalputhal machaane vaale the, shaayad usase zyada hi jitne ab maane jate hai, par puraa dosha inhen ke maththe madhuya mushkil he
 The reason is simple: the country's growth rate has seen a decline since the second quarter of 2016, six months before demonetisation and one year before the implementation of GST
 duubat karjon kii dikkatein 2016 main surkhiyon main aa gai thim or bahut zyada karj dene ke chalate 2014 se bainkon kii sehat par baari padane lagi thi
 So what was the reason for the fall in growth since 2016? This was a change in oil prices, which drove growth in 2014-15
 2013 ke uttarardh main sabase oonche str par pahunchane ke baad duniya bhar main tel kii keemten 2014-15 ke dauraan takreeban 70 fisadi gir gayi or 2016 kii pehali timahi aate-aate nichle str par pahunch gayi
 This steep decline was a strong positive push for India, which is believed to be the reason for the growth momentum during almost 2014-15
 2016 ke shuruaati maheenon ke baad se tel kii keemten lagbhag doguni ho gayi, jisane bahut bura asar daalaa or vruddhi ko lagaataar dhimaa kiya
 Demonetisation, GST and bad debts only made the bad situation worse, they did not create this bad condition
 jaahir he, kuch log daleel denge ki is afsane main isi vakt ke dauraan siyasat main aae amulchul badlaav or uske saath aamajanon kii bhaavana or sarkaar ke faisle lene main aae badlaavon kii ahmiyat ko ghataakar bataaya ja rahaa he
 i am not doing this
 main keval yah kah rahaa hum ki asaliyat main inamen se kisi bhi duusari vajah kii bajaae tel kii vaishvik keemton ne hindustan kii vruddhi kii raftaar ko kahin zyada prabhavit kiya
 To know where we can go in 2018 and beyond, we need to understand more clearly how to reach the top
 ek baar jab ham kaamchalaoo or aakasmik daleelon ko khaarij kar dete hai, tabhi ham oobdkhabad or pechida javaabon kii duniya main kadam rakhte hai, jo lambey vakt se chali aa rahi galat dharanaon se nijaat paane ke liye jaruri he
 i am going to start talking with one such misconception
 hindustan vaishvik arthvyavastha ke prati lambey vakt se, jitna mana jaataa he, usase kahin zyada khulaa rahaa he or he
 There is indeed a rift among analysts and policy makers that the dramatic increase in investment was largely due to the nation's highly acclaimed 9 per cent growth rate during 2003-08
 1991-92 ke udaarikaran or uske saath 1990 ke dashak ke aakhri saalon main companiyon main aae dhanchaagat sudhaaron kii badaulat korporate nivesh 2000 ke dashak kii shuruyaat ke jidipi ke 5-6 fisadi se badhkar 2008 tak jidipi ke 17 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 But both are responsible for this
 nivesh main badhotaree se dheron chizon kaa utpaadan hua, jinka kisi na kisi ko to upbhog karnaa hi padaa
 Despite the explosion of shopping malls in every corner, it was not domestic consumption that consumed this increase in production, as is commonly believed
 balki yah niryaat tha jo har saal takreeban 18 fisadi kii chaunkaane vaali raftaar se badha
 On the other hand, private consumption 7
 5 fisadi kii rakrataar se badi, jo arthvyavastha kii vruddhi dar se bhi itani kam thi ki jidipi main iskaa hissaa 62 fisadi se ghatakar 57 fisadi par aa gaya
 In order to understand this more well, despite the decline in the last few years, the share of exports in the GDP of India is 20% and it is equal to Indonesia and twice of Brazil
 growth main dhimepan ke rujhaan ke peeche sabase ahm vajah nivesh main lagaataar giravat ko mana jaataa he, jo 2012 main jidipi ke 37 fisadi ke sabase oonche str se philhal jidipi ke 30 fisadi se neeche aa gaya he
 But corporate investment took a dive in 2009 itself and has remained flat at around 12% of GDP since then
 badale main, awaas or esemai kshetra main nijee nivesh pichley paanch saalon main jidipi ke 15 fisadi se girakar takreeban 10 fisadi par par aa gaya he
 They had a significant impact on medium-term growth
 2003-08 ke dauraan hindustan kii 9 fisadi vruddhi niryaat main salanaa 18 fisadi kii oochaal kii badaulat thi
 In the last five years, exports have grown at a mere 3% per annum
 aane vaale saalon main agar niryaat doguni rakrataar se bhi badhata he, to bhi kul vruddhi ko 7 fisadi se upar jate dekh paanaa mushkil he
 Private investment in India does not falter either because the cost of funding is too high nor because banks are helpless with bad debts and not because the exchange rate is too high, as is the collective lamentation today
 ve isliye ladkadaae kyonki maang itani paryaapt nahin he ki bade niveshon ko jaij tehra sake
 In other luxuries, with global growth likely to return to below average, 7 per cent will be the new 9 per cent unless we see the economy's domestic factors rising enough to push the corporate to increase investment
 
 aisa kahana aasaan he, kar paanaa mushkil, kyonki iske liye us tantra par hi nae sire se vichaar karne kii jarurat he jo aazaadee ke baad se nitiyon or sudhaaron kii buniyaad rahaa he
 If we bother to remember, then India has been a supply-constrained economy whose structure contained high inflation and troubled current account deficit
 nitiyon or sudhaaron ko, takreeban puri tarah, samoochee arthvyavastha main aapurti kii adchanon ko kam karne ke liye hi badla gayah buniyadi dhaanche par kharch se lekar bainkon main nai puunji lagane tak or vittiya dabaavon, niamkeey jhatkon or saarvajanik kharch ke vikalpon ke jaal ke jariye ghar-pariwaron ko bachat (sevanivritti kii aamadani, bacchon kii padhai, swasthya or makaan banane ke liye) badhaate rahane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 To be fair, as long as foreign demand was sufficient to consume goods and services manufactured in the country, this one-sided thinking was correct
 ab yah sahi nahin rah gaya he
 The difficult aspect, however, is to question this 70-year-old structure and bring changes in it and then form a consensus among all the central, state and local governments on the need for this change
 nitiyon or sudhaaron ko nae sire se dhaalnaa banisbatan kam mushkil he or yah hindustan ke buniyadi dhaanche ko bheetar kii taraf zyada or baahar kii taraf kam dekhne vaala banane, swasthya seva or shiksha kii saarvajanik suvidhaon ko badhaane, budhaape kii dekhbhaal ke liye jabariyaa bachat ko kam karne vaale bime ke niyam-kaayadon main sudhaar laane or ritairement bachaton par ritern badhaane ke liye vittiya dabaavon ko khatm karne ke saath shuru ho jaataa he
 While no country with a per capita income of $ 1,800 has been able to sustain high growth without relying on exports, there is also no possibility that the global trade will be anywhere near the pre-economic growth rate
 Will be able to return lihaaja badhibia vikalp yahi hoga ki nitiyon ke palade ko or zyada gharelu maang paidaa karne kii taraf jhukaa diya jaae
 Will it happen? One can only hope, because the growth rate of 7 percent may not be enough: for the next 25 years, the per capita income of India will increase by just 15 percent from the per capita income of developed countries and its Asian Half of it will be increased from Hamarak countries

 Director Anil Kumar Chaudhary has given a few laugh-out-loud scenes to keep the film light-hearted, yet the film feels heavy and drawn

 From my point of view, a weak script has been written about a good subject
 isliye film ko meri taraf se 2 star
 Another thing was told in the film 'paper's Fools', why should you consider yourself weak by looking at others

 "unhone kaha ki logon main ek aam dharna he ki tip-2 madhumeh vaale yuvaaon ko insulin kii jarurat nahin hoti he, isliye aisa lagata he ki yah bhayaavah sthiti nahin he
 However, it is wrong to think so

 He gave some suggestions: - Choose only healthy foods to eat
 - pratidin tej raftaar main tahalein
 - Talk with your family about your health and the risk of diabetes and heart disease
 - yadi aap dhumrapaan karte hai, to ise chhodane kii pahal karen
 - Make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of diabetes and its complications for yourself, your family and for generations to come

 ) dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne ab ek or bada daanv khelaa he
 He has ordered a criminal case against two Union ministers and Reliance Group chairman Mukesh Ambani
 unka aarope he ki prakritik gas (natural gas) kii keemten tay karne main beyimaani hui he or iske liye do mantri murali devda or virappa moili tathaa mukesh ambani jimmedaar hai
 He also alleged that there is no shortage of gas in the country and to benefit individual interests, the price of gas has been raised from $ 4 to $ 8 and it will come into effect from April which will increase inflation in the country

 But the questions are many more
 bada sawaal he ki jab gas kii keemten tay karne kii prakriya chal rahi thi to arvind kejariwal ne kya kiya? beshak vah us samay siem nahin the lekin activist to the hi
 There is a bigger question than that, after all the problems of Delhi, why should he stick to a big national topic? This topic is important for Delhi and it is also their right to raise it, but what will happen to the other issues? Apart from this, an administrative question also arises whether the Government of Delhi has the right to order any Central Minister to sue? What would happen in the country if the state governments started investigating on such issues and ordered to file lawsuits? According to the constitution, the central government has the right to decide in matters related to it and decided to increase the prices of gas produced in the country

 a married woman embraced death in Indore city of Madhya Pradesh, fed up with her husband's illicit relations
 darasal, mahila ko haal hi main pataa chalaa tha ki uske pati ke apni ek rishtedaar mahila ke saath avaidh sambandh hai
 When the wife opposed this relationship, the husband beat her and drove her out of the house
 maamla panchayat main pahunchaa
 An agreement was reached between the two
 patni pati ke saath laut gai
 But he still did not agree
 is baat se khafa hokar us mahila ne faansee lagaakar jaan de di
 The woman has been identified as Nisha Sahu
 police ne suicide or utpeedan ke is maamle main mritka ke pati kanhaiyalaal, saas parvati, jeth mukesh sahu or jethaani hemlata ko namjad kiya he
 The incident is from the Lasudia police station area of indore
 police ke anusaar nisha kii shaadi 9 saal pehle kanhaiya sahu ke saath hui thi
 After marriage, her in-laws used to harass her for dowry
 2017 main sasuraal waalon ne nisha ko dahej kii maang karte hue ghar se nikaal diya tha
 Meanwhile, Nisha finds out that her husband is related to a female relative
 nisha ne sasuraal jaakar pati ke avaidh sambandhon kaa virodh kiya
 This thing was passed on to the husband
 usne nisha ko jamkar peeta
 When Nisha's family came to know, they also came down on protest
 maamla panchayat main ja pahunchaa
 Where the two sides reached an agreement
 kanhaiya samjhaute ke baad nisha ko ghar le gaya
 But his actions did not stop
 nisha ke sasuraal vaale phir se use pratadit karne lage
 Unhappy with this, Nisha committed suicide by hanging herself
 soochna milane par police maukey par ja pahunchi or shav kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 Now the police is preparing to take action against the accused
 dilli ke pashchim vihaar thane main aam aadmi party ke ek kaaryakarta ko balaatkaar ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The accused's name is Aftab Siddiqui
 aarope he ki aftab ne kareeb dedh saal pehle soft drink main nashila padaarth dekar ekladki kaa yon shoshankia or uskaa video bana liya
 After this, he continued to sexually abuse the girl by blackmailing her
 aftab karate teacher he or peedita aaropee kii chaatra thi
 The victim is married six months ago
 aaropee shaadi ke baad bhi usko lagaataar blackmel kar rahaa tha
 After the complaint of the woman, accused Aftab was arrested on 15 August
 court ne aaropee ko ek din kii police remand par bhej diya he
 The police have registered a case against Aftab under sections 506, 376, 387 of IPC
 aaj kaa din upi kii siyasat main hi nahin desh kii siyasat main bhi ek bada din hoga, jab pehali baar basapa supremeo mayawati or sapa chif akhilesh yadav ek saath chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 After a long time the BSP and SP joined hands and shared the stage but had not addressed the joint public meeting till now
 pehle charan ke chunaav main kuch hi din baaki hai or isse thik pehle in donon netaaon kii chunavi sabha hogi
 The first joint election meeting of these leaders will be held in Deoband Saharanpur on Sunday, where elections are to be held in the first phase
 90 ke dashak ke baad donon dal ke baar phir saath aa rahe hai
 At a time when polarization was at its peak due to the temple-mosque dispute in UP, the SP tied up with its anti-bsp to oust the BJP from power
 saal 1993 main rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hue tab sapa ko 110 siten or basapa ko 67 siten milin
 No party had a majority in the election
 mulaayam singh yadav ne iske baad bispi or anya kuch dalon ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai
 The BSP was supporting the government from outside, but after two years, in 1995, the alliance broke
 vah daur mulaayam or kanshiram kaa tha lekin itane varshon baad ab mayawati or akhilesh saath hai
 However, this time also BJP is in front
 raily par sabaki nazranis raily par sabaki nazren is baat par tiki rahengi ki aakhir yah donon hi netaa apane kaaryakartaaon saath aane kaa massej kaise dete hai
 Because until sometime back the leaders and workers of both parties did not even like to see each other
 aise main yah dekhne vaali baat hogi ki pehali baar chunavi jansabha main vah kya bolte hai
 The biggest challenge before both parties is the transfer of votes
 bijepi kii bhi najar is raily par rahane vaali he
 Along with BSP and SP, RLD is also involved in the joint rally
 is sanyukt raily ke saath hi mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ke chunavi daure kii shuruyaat ho jaaegi
 It is being told that there will be more than 10 such shared rallies
 pehle charan ke chunaav main kuch hi din baaki hai or pashchimi uttar pradesh kii siton par bijepi or mahagathbandhan ke bich kaante kii takkar he
 Voting will be held on 11 April: In the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, votes will be cast on 8 parliamentary seats of Uttar Pradesh on 11 April
 inamen saharanpur, kairana, mujffarnagar, bijanour, meerut, bagpat, gajiabad or gautamabuddha nagar kii siten shaamil hai
 All these 8 Lok Sabha seats of the state are from western Uttar Pradesh
 in sabhi siton par bijepi ne pichhali baar modi lahar main kabja jamaaya tha
 RLD chief Ajit Singh also lost the election
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in sabhi aath siton par bijepi ko jeet mili thi
 However, later in 2018, RLD wrested this seat from BJP with the support of BSP and SP in the election held in Kairana Lok Sabha seat
 isi jeet ke formule ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dohraane ke liye sapa-basapa or areldi ne haath milaayaa he
 This time, all the three parties are fighting elections together, there will be a fight of thorns

 Recalling the Tata group's proposal to launch the airline in association with Singapore International Airlines (SIA) in India in the mid-1990s, Tata said, "the sector is completely different today than it was then
" ’tata ne kaha, ‘yah bahut kuch doorsanchaar kshetra kii tarah ban gaya he
 There was a flood of companies and some of these operators were in financial trouble
 aaj kii taarikh main main is kshetra main kadam rakhane se hichakunga, kyonki is baat kii sambhaavna rahegi ki aapako isamen bahut had tak aisi pratispardhaa kaa saamana karnaa padegaa jo aswasth pratispardhaa hogi
 Asked if he was worried about the 'cut throat' competition, Tata answered no, but said, 'the fierce competition is to keep you out then it is destructive competition
 ’unhone kaha, ‘videshon main log yaa companiyaan diwalia ho jaati hai
 Here they do not do this, they continue to operate despite being in disrepair
 uske baad ve aapako khatm karne ke liye parichaalan kar rahe hai
 During the interview, Tata was asked whether it was right that someone had demanded a bribe of Rs 15 crore from him to accept the proposal of the tata-singapore airline
 is par tata ne kaha ki yah kahani sahi he, lekin us samay ke nagar vimaanan mantri ne sidhe unase yah raashi nahin maangi thi
 Tata said, 'A businessman told me why you don't give money
 mantri yahi chaahate hai’ kaarobaari ko is par unhone kya jawaab diya tha, is par tata ne kaha, ‘maine unase kaha ki aap nahin samajhate hai
 We do not do this kind of work
 unhone mujhase yahi kaha tha ki yadi aap airline shuru karnaa chaahate hai to aapako paisa dena hoga
 You know that the minister wants this
 
 15 crores
 ’tata ne kaha ki 1991 main samooh kaa chairman banane ke baad unhone ranneetik yojana banaai thi
 Under this, he was looking at new areas like aviation and defense in which the private sector can enter in a big way
 unhone kaha, ‘tathy yah he ki kai varshon tak ham par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the or praudyogiki nahin mil paa rahi thi yah apane aap main badi chunauti thi
 'but this challenge was never put before the private sector of the country, which is a matter of some disappointment for me
 ’tata ne kaha ki saarvajanik kshetra or sarkari prayogshaalaon ke nihit swaarthee tatv in kshetron main nijee companiyon kaa pravesh nahin hone dena chaahate hai
 He said that this is the reason that these areas were opened today, but still private sector participation in them is very limited

 ’ Speaking at an event organized by the Janata Dal (united) on Monday, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar not only reiterated that the state of the law will not show any kind of deficiency or weakness but also said that the Grand Alliance will never act on his behalf in practicing religion There will be no shortage
 nitish ke kanoon ke rajya or mahagathbandhan se sambandhit bayaan ko lekar uski apni tarah se log vyakhya kar rahe hai
 Speaking about the Grand Alliance, Nitish Kumar claimed that decisions are taken after consultations with the parties of the Grand Alliance and their top leadership
 nitish kaa ye daawa shaayad rajya main sharabbandi ko lekar kiye ja rahe kayaason par bachaav mana ja rahaa he kyonki rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke adhyaksh lalu yadav na keval sharabbandi ke khilaaf bataae jate hai balki nijee baatcheet main unhone kai baar media waalon se is baat kii charchaa main kaha he ki is sambandh main khaskar videshi sharaab par pratibandh lagaae jane par unhen koi jaankaree nahin thi
 However, Lalu Yadav has also publicly welcomed the move
 vahiin mahagathbandhan ke bare main nitish ne kaha ki jis dal kaa jitna adhikaar hota he, wo unka khyaal rakhte hai or daawa kiya ki unki taraf se kabhi koi kami nahin aegi
 They always have a strategic partnership even before the policy decision
 lekin is bayaan kaa apane party ke forum se bolne par rajnatik jaankaar maanate hai ki nitish ne pichley dinon lalu yadav dwaara apane party ke purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin ke us bayaan kaa jisamen unhone nitish ko paristhitiyon kaa netaa bataaya tha, par maun rahanaa unki naaraazgi kaa kaaran bataaya ja rahaa he
 Nitish knows that Lalu Yadav could have spoken on this issue but silently he has sent a message to his supporters that his silence is on the statement of Shahabuddin
 tippaniyan But while Nitish showed his displeasure, he clarified his stand on the law and order and has also sent a message to his colleagues, especially his supporters like Lalu Yadav and Shahabuddin, that it is useless to expect any leniency from them now and in the coming days, perhaps their government's criminal image Will show more interest and promptness in getting jail and punishment to the people of

 Though the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has not yet responded but the party leaders believe that keeping silence on Shahabuddin's issue is Lalu Yadav's compulsion but he also believes that Lalu Yadav started with a statement from Shahabuddin's statement He could have stopped the dispute but due to his personal compulsion he let that chance go
 vahiin congress party ne is mudde par nitish ke saath khadaa hokar ye jataa diya he ki wo is mudde par lalu yadav ke saath nahin hai

 Regarding the grand alliance, Nitish said that the party which has the right to take care of them and claimed that there will never be any shortfall from their side
 hameshaa nitigat faisle ke pehle wo nitigat saajhedaari bhi karte hai
 But on speaking this statement from his party's forum, political experts believe that Nitish has been silent on Lalu Yadav's statement of his party's former MP Mohammad Shahabuddin in which he had described Nitish as the leader of the situation
 The reason is being given nitish jaanate hai ki lalu yadav is mudde par bol sakate the lekin maun rahakar unhone apane samarthako main sandesh bheja he ki unki maun sahmati shahabuddin ke bayaan par he
 The comments lekin jahaan nitish ne naaraazgi dikhaai vahiin kanoon vyavastha par apana rukh saaf kar unhone apane sahyogiyon khaskar lalu yadav or shahabuddin jaise unke samarthakon ko bhi sandesh diya he ki ab unase koi narmi kii apeksha karnaa bekaar he or aane vaale dinon main shaayad unki sarkaar aapraadhik chhavi ke logon ko jail or sajaa dilaane main zyada dilchaspee or mustaidi dikhaaegi
 The state government is assuming that whatever the verdict comes in the Supreme Court, but the responsibility on the state government will increase further that the pending cases against people of criminal image like Shahabuddin should be cleared at the earliest

 At the same time, the Congress party has stood with Nitish on this issue and has expressed that he is not with Lalu Yadav on this issue

 The Supreme Court has made it mandatory to play the national anthem, ie 'jana Gana Mana' in theaters

 However, the tradition of playing the national anthem before film screenings in theaters has been there in the past
 madhyapradesh ke varisht patrkaar deepak tiwari kii kitaab 'raajnneetinama madhyapradesh' main iskaa ullekh he
 When there was a war between India and China in the sixties, the then Congress government made it mandatory to play the national anthem in theaters on the advice of Dwarka Prasad Mishra to inculcate the patriotism among the people of the country
 dwarka prasad mishra madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe hai
 Prior to this he was the Chancellor of Sagar University
 'raajnneetinama madhyapradesh' main deepak tiwari ne likhaa he ki april 1962 main sagar vishvavidhyalay main kulapati kaa kaarykaal puraa hone par dwarka prasad mishra jabalpur main jaakar bas gaye the
 He was in touch with Congress leaders and was also close to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 unheen dinon main bharat-china yuddh hua
 The Central Civil Council was then formed against the China attack under the chairmanship of Indira Gandhi
 dwarka prasad mishra ko jansampark samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 On Mishra's advice, the practice of playing the national anthem was started before the film was screened in theaters
 deepak tiwari ne enditivi ko bataaya ki china kaa hamalaa desh par badi vipatti kaa samay tha
 In those days there was a need to awaken the feeling of dedication towards the common man

 dwarka prasad mishra ko jansamooh ko deshbhakti kaa sandesh dene ke liye cinemaghar sabase upyukt lage or unhone in sthanon par raashtragan bajaane kii salaah sarkaar ko di
 Significantly, the Supreme Court said in an important order on Wednesday that the national anthem will be played before the film starts in all theaters across the country
 supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki rashtriya gaan bajte samay cinemahol ke parde par rashtriya dhvaj dikhaaya janaa bhi anivaary hoga, tathaa cinemaghar main maujuud sabhi logon ko rashtriya gaan ke sammaan main khadaa hona hoga
 The Supreme Court held that the national anthem is associated with national identity, national unity and constitutional patriotism
 court ke aadesh ke mutabik, dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik hit main rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaae
 The national anthem will not be used to create drama in any kind of activity and the national anthem will not be sung as Variety Song either
 aakhir kyon is shaks ne cinema haul main raashtragan par khadey hone kii yachika darj kii
 
 
 The comments is maamle main shyaam narayan chaukase kii yachika main kaha gaya tha ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik gatividhi ke liye rashtriya gaan ke chalan par roak lagaai jaani chahie, or antertenment sho main drama creat karne ke liye rashtriya gaan ko istemaal na kiya jaae
 The petition also stated that once started the national anthem should be sung to the end, and not stopped in between
 yachika main court se yah aadesh dene kaa aagrah bhi kiya gaya tha ki rashtriya gaan ko aise logon ke bich na gaaya jaae, jo ise nahin samajhate
 In addition, changing the tune of the national anthem should not allow singing in any other way
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki is tarah ke maamalon main rashtriya gaan niyamon kaa ulanghan he or yah varsh 1971 ke kanoon ke khilaaf he
 Earlier, the Supreme Court, hearing this petition, issued a notice to the Central Government in October seeking an answer

 The petition also stated that once started the national anthem should be sung to the end, and not stopped in between
 yachika main court se yah aadesh dene kaa aagrah bhi kiya gaya tha ki rashtriya gaan ko aise logon ke bich na gaaya jaae, jo ise nahin samajhate
 In addition, changing the tune of the national anthem should not allow singing in any other way

 Earlier, the Supreme Court, hearing this petition, issued a notice to the Central Government in October seeking an answer

 The Supreme Court held that the national anthem is associated with national identity, national unity and constitutional patriotism
 court ke aadesh ke mutabik, dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik hit main rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaae
 The national anthem will not be used to create drama in any kind of activity and the national anthem will not be sung as Variety Song either

 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne ek ahm aadesh main buudhvaar ko kaha ki deshbhar ke sabhi cinemagharon main film shuru hone se pehle rashtriya gaan zarur bajegaa
 The Supreme Court also said that while playing the national anthem, it would also be mandatory to show the national flag on the screen of the cinema hall, and all those present in the cinema hall would have to stand in honor of the national anthem
 supreme court ne kaha ki rashtriya gaan rashtriya pahchaan, rashtriya ekta or sanvaidhanik deshbhakti se judaa he
 As per the court order, care should be taken that the national anthem should not be used in any commercial interest
 kisi bhi tarah kii gatividhi main drama creat karne ke liye bhi rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal nahin hoga tathaa rashtriya gaan ko vairieti song ke taur par bhi nahin gaaya jayega
 After all, why did this person petition the cinema hall to stand on the national anthem

 ucchtam nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko muslim nikaayon se poocha ki kaise teen talaak jaisi pratha 'aasthaa' kaa vishay ho sakati he, jab ve kah rahe hai ki yah 'pitrusattatmak', 'dharamshastra ke anusaar galat' or 'paap' he
 a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar centered on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the practice of triple talaq prevalent among Muslims, All India Muslim Personal Law Board, All India Muslim Woman Personal Law Board and various other parties
 After listening to the pleas for six days during the summer vacation, the decision was reserved
 adaalat ne empielbi or purv kendriya mantri or varisht adhivaktaa salmaan khurshid kii baar-baar kii daleelon par gaur kiya ki teen talaak kaa pavitra quran main ullekh nahin he balki yah 'paap', 'aniyamit', 'pitrusattatmak', 'dharamshastra ke anusaar galat' or 'avaanchhneeya' he, lekin adaalat ko iskaa pareekshan karnaa chahie
 Khurshid, in his personal capacity, is assisting the court in the case
 peeth ne kaha, "aap (khurshid) kehete hai ki yah paap he
 How any sinful practice can be a matter of faith
 kya yah (teen talaak) lagaataar 1400 vashren se chal rahaa he
 The answer is 'yes'
 ' kya yah puri duniya main chal rahaa he
 The answer is 'no'
 ' vyavastha khud hi kahati he ki yah kharaab or galat he
 "the bench also consists of Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice RF Nariman, Justice u u Lalit and Justice Abdul Nazir
 tippaniyan These remarks were made when Khurshid was arguing the response
 unhone jor diya ki yah pratha paap he or dharamshastra ke anusaar galat he, yah kanuunan sahi nahin ho saktaa
 However, he argued that the court should not examine it
 peeth ne kaha, "isliye, jo kanuunan galat he vah pratha kaa hissaa nahin ho saktaa
 If it is wrong in theology, it cannot be legally accepted as morally wrong, it cannot be legally correct
 jo puri tarah naitik nahin he, vah kanoon sammat nahin ho saktaa
 "on behalf of Saira Banu, one of the three divorce victims, Senior Advocate Amit Singh Chadha began to argue for rebuttal, citing aimplb's stand
 empielbi ne kaha ki yah paap or pitrusattatmak pratha he or kaha ki yah islam kaa abhinn hissaa nahin ho saktaa
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The court noted the repeated pleas of AIMPLB and former Union Minister and Senior Advocate Salman Khurshid that the triple talaq is not mentioned in the Holy Quran but was 'sin', 'irregular', 'patriarchal', 'wrong according to theology' 'and' undesirable ', but the court should test it
 khurshid nijee haisiyat se maamle main adaalat kii sahaayta kar rahe hai
 The bench said, "you (khurshid) say that it is a sin
 kaise koi paapi pratha aasthaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Has this (three divorces) been going on continuously for 1400 years
 jawaab he 'haa
 'is it going on all over the world
 jawaab he 'nahin
 'the system itself says that it is bad and wrong
 " peeth main nyaayamurti courian joseph, nyaayamurti aar epa nariman, nyaayamurti you you lalit or nyaayamurti abdul nazeer bhi shaamil hai
 The comments ye tippanee tab kii gai jab khurshid pratyuttar par daleelein rakh rahe the
 He emphasized that this practice is a sin and theologically wrong, this law cannot be right
 haalanki, unhone daleel rakhi ki adaalat ko iskaa pareekshan nahin karnaa chahie
 The bench said, "therefore, what is wrong in law cannot be part of the practice
 agar yah dharamshastra main galat he to ise kanuunan sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa jo naitik rup se galat ho, vah kanuunan sahi nahin ho saktaa
 One who is not completely ethical cannot be lawful

 AIMPLB stated that it is a sin and patriarchal practice and said that it cannot be an integral part of Islam

 Around 2 lakh pensions being distributed by the Municipal Corporation are being rigged
 enditivi ke paas jab kuch vaardon ke pensioner kii list pahunchi to pataa chalaa ki nigam kii pension kahin bade mal ko mil rahi hai to kahin kudaghar or kahin to bank ke pate par teen saal se pension ja rahi he
 The question arises as to who is going to get the pension from these addresses, whereas for the destitute pension, elderly pension and widow pension given by the corporation, it is necessary to stay at one address for the last five years
 yahi nahin, har saal nigam main march main in pensioner kii states report bhi daakhil hoti he
 When we tried to check the address of the pensioners themselves, it came to know that by giving the address of 153 Kakrola Housing Complex, seven pension has been imposed

 The comments ye aise pensioner hai jo teen-teen saal se ek hazaar rupye masik pension le rahe hai
 However, Subhash Arya, the Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, says that we transfer money directly into the account
 aise main dhaandhlee hone kii ummid kam he
 But, the question arises that the needy people for whom this pension is being given, whether they are getting the benefit of it or any middleman is availing the benefits of pension by joining the councilor
 is baat kii tahakikat karne kii jarurat he tabhi doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani hoga

 In such a situation, there is little hope of rigging

 There is a need to investigate this matter only then there will be milk of milk and water of water

 ) Banaras Hindu University (BHU) has been in the news ever since molesting female students and police lathicharge
 23 sitambar ko hue chaatraon par lathicharge ke baad jila prashasan kii report ne biechayu management ko is puri ghatana ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya
 The fact is that the Vice Chancellor and the administration of BHU were so engrossed in arrogance and arrogance that they not only turned against the protests of the students, but did not accept the advice from the PMO to the Chief Minister
 rajya or centre sarkaar kii salaah kii khuleam dhajjiyaan udayi gayi
 Not only this, the BHU administration also resorted to lies and deceit to taint the legitimate movement of girl students
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii bhi nahin suni batajtak ko sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik 22 sitambar yani police lathicharge ke ek din pehle hi mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne vaais chancelar girish chandra treepathi se khud vyaktigat taur par baat kii thi or unako chaatraon se milane va unki shikayaton kaa niraakaran karne kii hidaayat di thi, lekin vaais chancelar ne unki ek nahin suchi
 So there were incidents like police lathicharge on girl students
 PMO ke aalaa adhikariyon ne bhi di thi salaahsutron ke mutabik 22 sitambar ko jab pradhanmantri banaras ke daure par the, to pradhanmantri karyaalay (PMO) ke aalaa adhikariyon ne bhi vaais chancelar ko is maamle ko jald se jald sulajhane ko kaha tha
 But it is clear that instead of following the advice of the PMO or Chief Minister, the Vice Chancellor listened more to his advisers and sycophants
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki jis din se chatraayen andolan par baithi thim, tabase hi jila prashasan ke aalaa adhikari kulapati se milane kii koshish kar rahe the

 While presenting a clarification regarding the lathicharge of the police, he had said that the students had crossed all limits by soaking a vessel on the statue of Mahamana Malaviya, but when the police sent samples of the statue of Malaviya for forensic investigation, the report on the statue Is not a fraction of soot haalanki yah special report abhi saarvajanik nahin kii gai he
 But the sources said that the matter of soot was denied in the report
 isse saaf he ki wo chatraayen sahi bol rahi thim ki malviya kii murti par kaalikh nahin lagaai gai
 This disclosure exposes the hypocrisy of the BHU administration
 isse saaf he ki kis tarah sembhooprashasan ne apni galatiyon par pardaa daalane ke liye juthi kahani gadhi
 Sack VC and file case: Congress, Congress has once again targeted the government over the BHU case
 congress netaa pramod tiwari ne kaha ki ham shuruyaat se kah rahe the ki malviya kii murti par koi bhi kaalikh nahin potee gai he
 Students of BHU consider him adorable
 karrwai un logon par hone chahie, jinhone madan mohan malviya ko is puure vivaad par ghasita
 The Vice Chancellor should not only be dismissed in the case, but a criminal case should also be filed against him
 congress netaa bole- piem ne kulapati ko kyon nahin samajhayaagar kulapati chaatraon se ja kar mil lete hai, unki shikaayat sun lete, to unka kya bighad jaataa
 But he was immersed in ego
 unhone sawaal kiya ki aakhir pradhanmantri ne unako kyon nahin samajhaayaa? pradhanmantri khud chaahate to mandir main durga kii puja karne ke saath-saath vah sadak par baithi durgaaon (chaatraon) se bhi mil sakate the, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya or apana rasta badal diya
 This is very unfortunate and the responsibility lies not only with the BHU administration but also with the central and state governments

 kya di company ke do bade gurgon kii ladaai company kii takat ko kar rahi he khokhla
 These questions have been continuously raised about d Company whether Dawood's most important henchman Chhota Shakeel is no longer his darling
 lekin chota shakeel, jisaki bhanak interpol tak ko nahin he ne khud hi un saare sawaalon ke jawaab de die hai
 It has been said many times in the news from the media and intelligence sources that the battle for war between Chhota Shakeel and Anees Ibrahim has never come to the fore, but both are trying to clear each other's cards
 lekin chota shakeel ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki anis uskaa bhai or acha dost he or un donon ke bich koi jhagada nahin he
 Shakeel also said that false news is spread in the media about him
 chota shakeel ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki uskaa daaud ke bhai anis ibrahim ke saath koi jhagada nahin he or barchasv ko lekar jang kii khabaren bebuniyaad he
 More than that, no matter where the d company is today, all its big henchmen are together
 is baatcheet main shakeel ne saaf-saaf kaha ki company ke bheetar sabake kaam bante hue hai
 Even if any discrimination arises, it is resolved by sitting among themselves
 chota shakeel yun to company main number teen kaa gurga he lekin wo company kaa sabase sharp shooter he or company ke sabase bade garh mumbai ke saare oparations sambhalata he
 The entire business of Bollywood, real estate, extortion and drug trafficking remains with Shakeel
 duusari taraf daaud kaa chota bhai anis ek tarah se company kaa financiel chif he
 Anees is in control of all the transactions of the company
 iske alaava bharat se baahar thailand, england, dubai or pakistan main real estate se jude saare kaam bhi anis ibrahim hi sambhalata he
 On Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address at the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that the Prime Minister is not being allowed to speak in Parliament, if the speech that PM gave in today's meeting, he would speak to small traders But young and poor all start dancing and Rahul Gandhi has no issue to speak

 meerut kaa hashimpura narsanhaar desh kii aazaadee ke baad hiraasat main maut kaa sabase bada maamla he
 The victims of this massacre and the lawyers and civil society advocates of them say that such a massacre cannot happen without the gesture of senior officials of the state and the country
 varsh 2012 main hamaari team nehashimpura kandake peediton, unke pariwaron or is maamle par najar rakhane waalon kii raay jaani thi
 Here are excerpts from that report
 bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad dow
 Subrahmanyam Swamy, the then Minister of State for Home Affairs, P
R
 chidambaram ko doshi maanate hai
 Swamy alleged, "chidambaram had a meeting of top officials at the Meerut Collectorate on May 18, 1987
 usee baithak main unhone kaha tha, 'unhen sabak sikhaao
 After all, what is the power of government? Pick up and kill 40-50 young people
 ' us baithak main mohasina kidawai shaamil nahin thim
 Kidwai was the MP of Meerut and the Cabinet Minister for Urban Development in the then Rajiv Gandhi government
 dow
 Swami said, "the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Veer Bahadur Singh told me that Chidambaram was guilty for this massacre
 '' unhone is babat pradhanmantri ko patr likhakar jawaab maanga tha or jawaab na milane kii surat main maamle ko international criminal court main le jane kii dhamkee di thi
 P
 Despite efforts by India Today
 chidambaram kii pratikriya is maamle par nahin mil pai thi
 In fact, after the Rajiv Gandhi government's decision to open the Babri Masjid lock in February 1986, riots started in many cities of North India, especially Uttar Pradesh
 meerut main april main danga bhadkaa tha, lekin use dabaa diya gaya
 After this, 38 columns of security forces deployed there were gradually removed
 18 may ko phir danga bhadkaa or use dabaane ke liye police, sena, siarpief or provincial armd kanstableri (piesi) ke javaanon ko bulaayaa gaya
 The riots did not stop when Prabhat Sharma, the nephew of senior BJP leader Shakuntala Kaushik, lived in Abdul Wali, a neighborhood next to Hashimpura, on his roof
 hashimpura ke sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki piesi kii cross firing main prabhaat kii maut ho gai
 During the riots, Kaushik wrote in his autobiography Prerna, "my elder sister Satish was a major in Meerut, and his elder nephew was a police officer in Lucknow
 '' is ghatana ke agle hi din hashimpura ke muslim naujavaanon ke saath jo hua, vah sharmnaak itihaas ban gaya
 The media, civil society and minority organizations expressed their displeasure after the demise of the governance apparatus was exposed
 uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vir bahadur singh ne isaki jaanch kaa jimmaa krime branch central investigeshan department (sibisiidi) ko saunpa, jisane chah saal baad farvari 1994 main report di
 But the governments of Mulayam Singh Yadav (janata dal-sp), Kalyan Singh (BJP) and Mayawati (BSP) did little to punish the culprits
 farvari 1995 main piesi ke 19 javaanon ke khilaaf gajiabad ke mukhya nyaayik magistrate (sijeem) kii adaalat main aaropapatr daakhil kiya gaya
 The court issued six bailable and 17 non-bailable warrants against the accused during January 1997 to April 2000 although all the accused were in the active service of the PAC
 may 2000 main media main hangaame ke baad 19 main se 16 abhiyukt hajir hue or june-july main sabko jamaanat mil gai kyonki ''sarkari naukar'' hone kii vajah se ve faraar nahin honge
 Meanwhile, on the application of the riot victims, the Supreme Court transferred the case to Tis Hazari Court in Delhi in 2002
 2002-04 tak uttar pradesh sarkaar ne koi qualiphoid or profeshnal special public prosicuter (esapeepi) niyukt nahin kiya
 Two spps were appointed from March 2004 to 2006 but both failed
 police prashasan main sansthagat purvaagrahahashimpura narsanhaar ke baad abhiyukt piesi javaanon ko chah maheene ke liye nilambit kiya gaya tha or phir unhen seva main behaal kar diya gaya
 Advocate Vrinda Grover says, "we came to know from the RTI that his (1987 to 2002) annual confidential report does not even mention the investigation against him, not even whether he is accused of murder or (delhi) K) Trial is going on in Tis Hazari Court
 usamen likhaa hua he ki ve bahut anushaasit sipaahi hai, bahut chust kabddi ke khilaadi hai
 Three of the PAC accused have died
 purv saansad saiyad shahabuddin ne kaha tha, ''jin logon ne communal kiling main hissaa liya, castodial kiling kii, unako dismis nahin kiya
 "there is institutional bias in the police of this country," says Grover
 yah ek machhlee puure talab ko ganda karne vaala maamla nahin he
 It is true that only one or two people make a mistake, but the whole organization is trying to save it
 ''insaaf ke paanv main bedigrover kahati hai, ''sibisiidi ko is cese kii jaanch main chah saal lag gaye
 Prolonged investigations mean the case will be weakened
 '' yah puraa maamla paristhitijanya sabooton ke aadhaar par tikaa he
 The 41st Corps of PAC was on duty
 log book main he ki koun-sa trek kahaan gaya, kitna dijal tha, kitne kimi chalaa
 Which fire arms were given to whom
 trek par andhadhundh goli chalaane se piesi ke aadmi ko goli lagi
 The next day he was taken to the hospital, he has a medical report
 vah maamle kaa abhiyukt he
 All evidence is under the control of PAC
 piesi ke platoon commander (divangat surendra paal singh) ke hastakshar pahchaanane se unke jawan inkaar kar dete hai
 Confirmation of that signature before the court is necessary
 grover kahati hai, ''cese lanbaa chalegaa to gavaah marenge, jinda bhi rahe to ghatana ke bare main bhul jaaenge
 Mohammad Junaid, a lawyer who advocated the victims of the Hashimpura massacre, says, "the testimony of the PAC accused has been done
" sena ke major ji
 s
 pathania or karnal cheema is maamle main mahatvapurn gavaah hai, lekin kai baar saman bhejne ke baavjood ve nahin aae
 We feel that these two can shed more light on this matter
 '' sena ke kuch gavaah aaj bhi pension lete hai lekin ve gavaahi ke liye nahin aate
 Grover feels that the victims may lose the case, although Junaid expected justice

 Swami says, "the justice of the Nazis got justice after 40 years in the Nuremburg trial of Yadis genocide
" is maamle main insaaf is desh ke astitv ke liye jaruri he

 Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed's tweet about the Bangalore blast is insensitive and inhuman
 tippaniyan Though Shakeel Ahmed denied comment on his tweet, Union Minister of State for Home RPN Singh said, "no political meaning should be extracted in cases related to terror attacks

 iske kareeb 25 minute baad karnataka bhaajapa ke twitor acount se bhi palatwaar kiya gaya, bengalooru dhamaake ko lekar congress pravaktaa shakeel ahamed kaa twit asamvedansheel or amanviya he
 The comments haalanki shakeel ahamed ne apane twit par tippanee se inkaar kiya, lekin kendriya grih rajyamantri arpyen singh ne kaha, aatanki hamalon se jude maamalon main koi raajnneetik arth nahin nikaale jane chahie
