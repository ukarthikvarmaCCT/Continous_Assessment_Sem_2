 # hindidivas The Supreme Court today refused to consider the plea in which Narendra Modi has been questioned for giving a clean chit by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in connection with the investigation into the 2002 riots in Gujarat
 nyaayamurti echel dattu or nyaayamurti ese bobade kii peeth ne us aagrah par bhi vichaar karne se inkaar kar diya, jisamen supreme court ke avkashprapt nyaayadhishon or alpsankhyak samudaay ke ek vyakti ko shaamil kar vishesh jaanch dal kaa punargathan karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Referring to the request challenging the bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate to be given a clean chit by the Special Investigation Team, the bench said that in this situation the reorganization of the Special Investigation Team is not right
 court kii peeth kii is tippanee ke baad adhivaktaa fatima ne yachika waapas lene kaa faisla kiya
 The petition was filed by Fatima itself
 maaloom ho ki supreme court kii ore se gathit esaiti ne gulburg sosayadi dange ke maamle main 2012 main modi ko clin chit de di thi
 The petition was filed by the wife of former Congress MP Zakia Jafri who was killed in the riots in protest against the SIT report, but the lower court had in December 2013 stamped the closure report of the SIT giving clean chit to Modi
 closer report main esaiti ne kaha tha ki use modi ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mila he
 Zakia Jafri says that there is enough evidence in this case to prosecute other leaders including Modi, police officers and bureaucrats
 phalgun maah ke shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko aamalki ekadshi kehete hai
 Amalaki means Amla has a great place in the scriptures
 vishnu ji ne jab sristi kii rachana ke liye brahma ko janm diya, usee samay unhone aanwale ke vriksh ko janm diya
 Amla is revered by Lord Vishnu as the Adi tree
 iske har ang main ishwar kaa sthaan mana gaya he
 On Monday, there is Amalaki Ekadashi, the constellation of Saturn is Pushya
 pushya ko nakshatron kaa raja mana jaataa he
 Amalaki Ekadashi is the day of Lord Vishnu
 is din shiv puja kerani chahie
 Know the ways to get benefit in Amalki Ekadashi
 aamalki ekadshi vrath kii puja vidhiamalki ekadshi main aanwale kaa vishesh mahatv he
 On this day, amla is used in every work from worship to food
 is din subah uthakar bhagwaan vishnu kaa dhyaan kar vrath kaa sankalp karnaa chahie
 After taking the resolution of the fast, one should worship Lord Vishnu after retirement
 ghi kaa deepak jalkaar vishnu sahasranam kaa paath karen
 There are many benefits of keeping a turtle in the house, but keep in mind the direction, after worshiping, a navaratna vase should be installed under the gooseberry tree
 agar aanwale kaa vriksh uplabdh nahin ho to aanwale kaa fal bhagwaan vishnu ko prasad swaroop arpit karen
 Amla tree should be worshiped with incense, lamp, sandalwood, roli, floral, Akshat, etc
 and a poor, needy person or a Brahmin should be fed under it
 jain mahakumbh: koun the bhagwaan bahubali, jaaniye asli kahaniagale din yani dwadashi ko snaan kar bhagwaan vishnu ke pujan ke baad jarutmand vyakti yaa brahman ko kalash, vastra or aanwala aadi daan karnaa chahie
 After this, fasting should be taken after taking food
 aamalki ekadshi vrath kaa mahatvapadam puraana ke anusaar aamalki ekadshi kaa vrath karne se sainkadon tirth darshan ke samaan punya praapt hota he
 a person receives salvation by observing Amalaki Ekadashi fast which gives fruits equal to all yagyas
 jo log aamalki ekadshi kaa vrath nahin karte hai vah bhi is ekadshi ke din bhagwaan vishnu ko aanwala arpit karen or swayan bhi khaaen
 According to the scriptures, consuming amla on the day of Amalaki Ekadashi is very beneficial

 Rahul Gandhi's discussion is not because he recently interviewed newspapers and television
 lekin, is lihaaz se ki congress kitni baar unako pre−launch, launch or ri−launch karegi
 In the recent AICC session, when Rahul Gandhi was heard speaking jokes like selling comb to the ganja, then it became clear that he too can play jokes like Narendra Modi
 jab unhone manmohan singh kii maujuudagi main puri congress se kaha ki nau silinderon se kaam nahin chalegaa, hamen 12 silinder chahie, to aisa laga ki rahul gandhi netagiri kii bhashaa bolnaa sikh gaye hai
 But still, the brightness of Rahul Gandhi should not be seen
 baavjood iske ki aanevaale samay main party main manmohan singh ke kambek kii sambhaavnaaen bahut kam hai or rahul gandhi ke peeche puri party khadi he
 From the advertisements being given in the newspapers to the statements constantly, all is in favor of Rahul, but he has not reached the threshold of mass mobilization
 kya congress rahul gandhi se zarurat se zyada ummid laga baithi he? aaie dekhen charchaa

 Where he was drugged and drugged when he became conscious after drinking the intoxicating substance
 kisi tarah vah uske changul se bachakar bhaagi or kotwali police ke paas pahunchi

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly, Vijender Gupta, said that the Kejriwal government cabinet's decision to regularize guest teachers is airborne
 bill ko cabinet main sweekruti dene se purv vibhageeya, vittiya or vidhi vibhaagon kii anivaary sweekruti nahin lee gai
 It is not a decision taken on any sound basis
 yah keval vot bank kii raajnneeti se prerit he
 Necessary procedure was not adopted for the cabinet approved bill
 iske liye jaruri taiyaari bhi nahin kii gai
 Approval of the bill was not taken from the concerned departments and it was presented in the cabinet in a hurry
 aise aadhe-adhure bill ko vidhansabha main paarit karne se koi samaadhaan nahin nikalataa dikh rahaa he
 BJP leader Vijendra Gupta demanded the Kejriwal government to adopt a rational and equitable way to regularize the teachers
 aaj liya gaya cabinet nirnay aam aadmi party kii baukhalaahat ko chhipaane kaa vifal prayaas maatr he
 Neither the concerned department nor the financial department was taken into confidence before the bill was introduced
 bill laane ke liye aupchaarik prakriya kaa bhi paalan nahin kiya gaya
 During his two and a half year tenure, the government played with the feelings of the teachers and played with their future in the name of regularizing guest teachers
 aaj kaa cabinet nirnay bhi isi kadi main liye jane vaala kadam he
 BJP Vijender Gupta said that in the assembly session held in August, the government had announced to give weightage to his experience, but now suddenly the matter of regularizing him as if it had leaked from the sky
 adhyapakon ke niyamit karne ke liye abhi tak koi kanoonee dhaancha taiyaar nahin kiya gaya he
 The bill passed by the cabinet is not raw, but proposed so that it can stand the judiciary and the legal process
 yah logon ko gumraah karne ke liye raajnneetik daanv-pech he
 Gupta expressed deep concern that due to the political attitude of the government, the issue of recruitment of teachers is getting complicated
 iske saath hi shiksha ke str par bura prabhaav pad rahaa he
 The government has failed to address the large number of teachers
 aam aadmi party ne vaada kiya tha ki ve anubandh ke aadhaar par kaam karne vaale sabhi karmchaariyon ko niyamit karegi, parantu dhai varsh kaa kaarykaal biit jane par bhi abhi tak ek bhi vyakti ko niyamit nahin kiya gaya
 Guest teachers have also been caught in the political claims of the government so far and the government has failed to take any concrete steps to regularize them

 He said that about 120-140 people are traveling in each such boat

 The budget session of Delhi Assembly ended on Tuesday
 satr ke aakhri din bhi bijepi vidhayak dilli main pani kii killat par charchaa karnaa chaahate the, lekin baar-baar ho rahe hangaame ke kaaran spikar ne marshalon kii madad se bijepi vidhayakon ko sadan se baahar kar diya
 After this, Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta said that the Chairman and Chief Minister of Delhi Jal Board are running away from discussing the shortage of water in Sejri Delhi and the supply of sewage effluent
 vijender gupta ne bataaya ki aaj kaarysoochee main dopaher 3 se 4 baje tak pani par charchaa soochibaddh thi or sarkaar ko is par jawaab dena tha, lekin shaam 5 baje takamukhyamantri kejarivalsadan main nahin aae tab vipaksh ne pani ke mudde par charchaa kii maang kii lekin spikar ne pani ke mudde par charchaa na karaane kii baat kahi or jab iske virodh main bijepi vidhayakon ne sadan main gande pani kii bottlen dikhain or mukhyamantri ko sadan main upasthit hokar jawaab dene kii maang kii to aadhe ghante ke liye sadan sthagit kar diya gaya
 When the House resumed after half an hour, the BJP mlas again drew attention to the lack of water and the supply of dirty water
 unhone punah gande pani kii bottlen dikhain or sadan main charchaa kii maang kii
 This time, BJP mlas also wore placards around the neck which read, 'delhi thirsty, bad condition with dirty water, missing Kejriwal from Vidhan Sabha'
 lekin is baar spikar ne marshalon kii madad se netaa pratipaksh vijender gupta, opi sharma, jagadish pradhan or manjinder singh sirsa ko sadan se baahar jane ko kaha
 After coming out of the House, the opposition leaders alleged that the government was running away from responding to the public interest issue and the Kejriwal government was not serious about tackling the water problem in Delhi

 The Dalate political equation made Jitan Ram Manjhi the chief minister of Bihar for nine months
 isi badlaav ne unhen jedy (you) ke nitish kumaar se baghawat karne par amada kar diya or isi kii vajah se vidhansabha main shakti pareekshan se pehle hi apane pad se istipha dekar aakhirkaar haar maan lee
 In this order, Manjhi may have drowned his eyes but he made Mahadalits important in the politics of the state
 vaise, mukhyamantri banane ke do maheene baad hi maanjhi ke tevar badal gaye the or mahadaliton ke bich nitish kii chhavi dhoomil karne main jute gaye the
 Apparently, the BJP was most happy with this
 mana jaataa he ki is baghawat ke drame kii patakatha bijepi ne hi taiyaar kii thi, maanjhi to mahaj mohara maatr the
 On the eve of the show of strength in the assembly, the numbering was entirely with Nitish Kumar
 vah sattarudh jedy (you) ke 97 vidhayakon kii parade apane paksh main kara chuke the, or 233 sadasyeey sadan main unhen lalu prasad kii argedy (24 vidhayak), congress (5), sipii (1) or do nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil ho chukaa tha
 The BJP, with 87 mlas, was not in a position to bring 30 more mlas required for a majority
 haalanki party ne antim kshan tak sabhi ko yah anumaan lagaate rahane diya tha ki kya vah maanjhi kaa samarthan karegi
 But the game will now begin in Bihar — and the game will revolve largely around the 70-year-old Manjhi, and the number of votes he will be able to take from the JD (U)
 bijepi ne yah ghoshnaa karke maanjhi kii mahatvakankshaon or maanjhi ke ahankaar ko bilkul antim kagaar tak bhadakaane kii koshish kii thi ki nitish kumaar ne mahadalit samudaayon kaa apmaan kiya he or yah ki vah iskaa badla legi
 BJP hopes that Mahadalit will have to fight the equally difficult battle to deal with Manjhi's loss to Manjhi by cutting votes
 vidambnaa yah he ki 22 'sabase garib dalit' jatiyon kaa ek up-khand—mahadalit—nitish kumaar ne hi 2007 main mukhyamantri rahete hue banaaya tha
 It is hoped that in the coming months, the BJP will talk to Manjhi, motivate him to form his own party, and with this the electoral ground will open a little more
 maanjhi ko samarthan karne ko jaij tehraate hue bihar se endie ke ek sheersh netaa ne kaha, ''hamaare dushman kaa dushman hamaara dost hi hoga
 "before Nitish and BJP parted ways in 2013, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said on February 16," We will remain in opposition for the next six months
 ham bihar main koi sarkaar banane nahin ja rahe hai
 "thus, the final game looks set to be played by the winter of 2015, in which the BJP will hope that Manjhi will shift Nitish's base
" jo koi bhi maanjhi kaa uttaradhikari hoga, uske liye jatigat ganit aasaan nahin hoga
 This arithmetic will be a measure of the caste and religious structure of each section, and about who will benefit
 bijepi netaaon kaa maananaa he is ganit main apni mahadalit pahchaan ke saath maanjhi ahm ho jate hai, jiske bare main unhen ummid he ki unhen isse lalu-nitish kaa kila dhahaane main madad milegi
 It has been fortified by a strong vote bank of backward-muslim-mahadalit
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki ati pichhadi jatiyon (ibisi) ke matadaataaon kaa ek bada hissaa jedy (you) ko chhodkar bijepi ke saath aa gaya tha, lekin mahadalit jedy (you) ke saath date rahe the
 "our estimates indicate that Mahadalits had voted in favor of Nitish in bulk (around 90 per cent)," says the top BJP leader responsible for strategizing in the state
 ''bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi kaa maananaa he ki mahadaliton ke bich nitish kumaar ke bolbaale par bijepi ko ek jawaab mil gaya he
 "as soon as JD (U) took action against Jeetan Ram Manjhi, there were spontaneous protests against the party in a few hundred places across the state," he told reporters on 16 February
 isse kya sanket miltaa he? yah ki maanjhi dalit pratik ban gaye hai
 "if Manjhi actually takes a substantial portion of the Mahadalit votes, then it will be like taking revenge for the BJP leaders of the state, who are always reeling in the illusion that Nitish has given them one in every respect Junior partners continued to understand
 haalanki 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main, lalu prasad ke saath sambandh khatm karne ke baad jab nitish rajnatik patan kii kagaar par the, tab unhen lalu-virdohi morche ke netaa ke rup main pesh karke unka rajnatik kad bijepi ne hi badhaayaa tha
 In whatever direction the wind blows in the next six or eight months, it is unlikely for Nitish to return for the last decade
 2005 kaa vidhansabha chunaav jeetne or uske baad 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rajya kii 40 siton main se endie ke 32 siten jeetne ke baad, nitish ne 2010 main daliton main se ek pramukh paswan jati ko alag-thalag karke alpsankhyakon or mahadaliton ke bich ek samarthan aadhaar taiyaar kiya or uske baad 141 vidhansabha siton par apni party ko chunaav ladvaya tha
 On 24 November 2010, when the results of the assembly elections were announced, it seemed as if Nitish could not make any mistake — his JD (U) alone 65 in alliance with the BJP
 6 lakh se adhik, yaa kul ke 22
 Gained 58 percent of the vote
 chaar varsh se kam samay main unka purna patan ho chukaa tha
 After separating from the NDA in June 2013, Nitish entered the 2014 general election alone, relying on the ecb-mahadalit-minority support base
 2009 main mili 20 siton se ghatakar jedy (you) sirf do siton par simat gai
 Even the number of votes it received decreased (from 56 million to more than 58 lakhs)
 6 lakh)
 Although the party contested 37 seats, 12 more than in 2009
 jabaki argedy ko 72 lakh se adhik vot mili the
 When the party's back was broken, Nitish saw a silver lining in this arithmetic - the JD (U) and RJD got more votes than the BJP, and Nitish expects the assembly elections to be held around october-november
 For they will strengthen this mass base
 yah thik vahi bindu he, jahaan maanjhi ahm ho jate hai
 The BJP hopes that Nitish's social engineering formula is set to collapse this time
 lekin, rank se phir raja ban jane kaa jumala bihar kii raajnneeti ke liye asaamaanya nahin he
 Now the wait is for Nitish's next bet

 It is worth mentioning that on November 15, Manjhi had said that on the occasion of the launch of commercial operation from the first unit of 660 MW of ntpc's super power station in Badh in Patna district and the unit of Kanti Bijli Utpadan Nigam Limited of Muzaffarpur

 And one thing is that love does not necessarily come from living together
 
 Love is like a medium that connects two people, builds trust, gives courage, makes one feel connected

 ' supreme court ne gujarat se jude tulsiram prajapati kathith farjimuthabhed kandamen sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh diya he
 Prajapati Sohrabuddin Sheikh was an eyewitness to the fake encounter case
 is hatyakand se pradesh ke purv mantriamit shaahaka naam kathith taur par judaa he
 a bench of Justice p Sadasivam and Justice BS Chauhan dismissed the Gujarat government's plea that a CBI inquiry cannot be ordered in the case as the state police had already filed a charge sheet in the case
 is bare main prajapati kii maa narmada bai ne apil daayar kii thi
 The appeal alleged that Prajapati was allegedly killed by the Gujarat police in a fake encounter as he was an eyewitness to the killing of Sohrabuddin and his wife Kausar Bi
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki yachikakarta ne is maamle ko sibiai ko sthanantarit karne ke liye bahut majbootee se pesh kiya he kyonki is maamle main teen pradeshon, andhra pradesh, rajasthan or gujarat kii police ke shaamil hone se jude kai andeh hai
 The bench, however, made it clear that all the views given in this judgment will have no effect on the trial court hearing the case
 nyaayalay ne is hatyakand kii gujarat police dwaara jaanch dhimi gati se kiye jane kii bhi aalochana kii
 The bench also regretted that the state police took more than three and a half years to file chargesheet after the murder
 gujarat sarkaar ne is aadhaar par sibiai jaanch kaa virodh kiya ki prajapati kii hatya muthbhed kaa ek pruthak maamla he or yah kisi bhi tarah soharabuddin shaikh muthbhed maamle se sambandhit nahin he
 On March 15, the bench reserved its decision in the matter
 gujarat sarkaar or shah ne is maamle ko sibiai ko saunpe jane kaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya tha ki centre is maamle main purv mantri shah or mukhyamantri narendra modi ko fansaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 However, senior counsel KTS Tulsi and Narmada Bai's counsel appearing for CBI justified the handing over of the case to CBI
 unka tark tha ki gujarat police kii jaanch ‘pakshpatpurna’ he or prajapati kii hatya soharabuddin kii hatya se judaa maamla he

 All India majlis-e-ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MP Asaduddin Owaisi has expressed concern over the increasing incidents of mob lynching in the country
 unhone in ghatnaon main alpsankhyakon ke shikaar banaae jane ko lekar kaha ki rashtriya maanav adhikaar ayog (NHRC) kaa adhyaksh alpsankhyak ayog se hona chahie
 Actually, Owaisi was talking about fake encounters, custodial death and mob lynching
 isi dauraan unhone kaha, 'supreme court ne kaha he ki centre ko mob linching par kanoon bananaa he, lekin sarkaar ne aisa kyon nahin kiya? jin police adhikariyon par bheed kii hinsa ke liye aarope lagaae jate hai, unhen sajaa kyon nahin di jaati he?'ovaisi mob linching or farji encounter ke maamalon ko lekar pehle bhi mukhar rahe hai
 Owaisi has demanded the Center to enact laws to prevent incidents of mob lynching as directed by the Supreme Court
 hyderabad main unhone 6 july ko kaha ki sheersh adaalat dwaara centre ko kanoon kaa masauda taiyaar karne kaa nirdesh die ek saal ho gaye hai, lekin modi sarkaar ne kuch nahin kiya he
 Describing those involved in mob lynching as terrorists, Owaisi said that such incidents are the result of spreading hatred against Muslims
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi se mob linching kii ghatnaon par karrwai karke apni sanvaidhanik jimmedaari kaa nirvahan karne kaa aagrah kiya
 Owaisi wondered what is stopping the Prime Minister from enacting laws, while he constantly talks about winning the trust of Muslims
 vah jharkhand main tabrej ansaari kii haalia hatya ke virodh main ek jansabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 The Hyderabad MP said that in the last five years more than 50 persons, most of whom are Muslims, have died in mob lynching incidents
 unhone kaha ki 23 may se, jab chunavaa jitkar bhartiya janata party satta main dobaaraa ai, tab se aath log is tarah kii ghatnaon kaa shikaar ho chuke hai
 Owaisi said that in Jharkhand where BJP is in power, 18 people have died during the last four and a half years

 Gupta said, 'it is not enough for a minister to leave the cabinet for the sex scandal that is embarrassing Delhi
 unhen party se bhi nikaalnaa chahie
 All the corrupt ministers still remain the party's glory
 kejarivalaur sisodiya jaldi karrwai karne par bina shame apni peeth thapthapa rahe hai, lekin aaj tak daagi nikle kisi bhi mantri ko party se nahin nikaala gaya
 'why not remove such people from the party: On the other hand, senior Congress leader and Delhi Pradesh President Ajay Maken questioned who has chosen such people as a minister? He said, 'now that such people are being caught, Kejriwal is taking credit for removing them
 ' maakan ne twit kar kaha ki 'aap' ke 6 main se 3 mantri daagi sabit hue hai
 Who made those ministers involved in fake degrees, corruption and immoral work? Maken also asked Kejriwal that what is the compulsion, because of which Kejriwal has not removed people with fake degrees and corruption? Now will Kejriwal expel Sandeep Kumar from the party? 3 of 6 Ministers in AAP Govt caught for: 1

 swaraj abhiyaan ne kaha ki punjab main bhi party netaaon par isi tarah kii shikaayatein aa rahi hai
 Will the party take steps after the news goes on the TV channel? Now politics will be on CD? BJP, Congress also remove from the party, then what is the difference between BJP Congress and AAP? Yogendra Yadav said that the purpose with which the Aam Aadmi Party used to talk about different politics is proving to be a failure

 At the same time, the BSP wants the Congress to be weakened not only in UP but also in other states

 The film was an excellent work on grand sets, costumes, dramatic scenes and soundtracks
 kamai ke maamle main devdas us saal kii sabase zyada grosing vaali film sabit hui thi
 In Devdas, Shahrukh returns to India after studying law from London to marry childhood love Paro

 Its budget was about 50 crores

 On June 30, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced the debt waiver of farmers
 tab unhen ummid thi ki 32,020 karod ru
 That 89 lakh farmers will benefit from this 'historic' debt waiver
 lekin pataa yah chalaa ki 22 sitambar kii aakhri taarikh tak sirf 58 lakh kisaanon ne karj maafee ke liye arji di he
 Government officials say it is surprising to see fewer people coming forward under the promise of debt waiver
 sahakaari mahakme ke ek bade afasar ko isamen ghotaale kii bu aa rahi haih ho saktaa he, jila sahakaari bainkon ne aise kisaanon ke farji yaa benami khate khol rakhe hon jinka vajood hi na ho
 The number of farmers entitled to loan waiver was extracted on the basis of data provided from these banks
 ek afasar kehete hai, ''mumkin he ki unhone (bank afasaron ne) aankade badha-chadhaakar bataae hon
 In earlier schemes, the money was directly deposited in banks
 magar is baar karj maafee kii rakam alag-alag kisaanon ke khaaton main sidhe jaani he or vah bhi unki aadhaar pahchaan kii tasdik karne ke baad
 For this, the process of online application was made in which it was made mandatory for the farmers to provide their Aadhaar number documents along with proof of ownership of the land
 rajya sarkaar ke soochna praudyogiki mahakme ke principal secretary ve
 K
 gautam kehete hai ki jin aavedakon ne apane aadhaar ke byore pesh nahin kiye hai, ve karj maafee ke hakdaar nahin honge
 He also said that farmers would be given one more chance to present copy of Aadhaar card
 haalanki krishi mantri pandurang phundakar ukvamid se kam argiyaan aane kii ek or vajah bataate hai
 According to him, in many farming families, there has been a division of holdings between the brothers, but the ownership on paper has not changed
 phundakar kehete hai, ''vidarbha or marathavada main aise kai maamle hai
 Since the owner of the farm land is entitled to loan waiver, others are not considered as beneficiaries
 '' haalanki karj parivaar ko ek ikai ke taur par diya jaataa he
 Farmers' organizations have also protested against Aadhaar
 shetakari sanghatana ke adhyaksh raghunatha patil kehete hai, ''yojana se kisi ko bhi isliye maharoom nahin karnaa chahie kyonki uske paas aadhaar number nahin he

 He was appointed Deputy Governor of RBI in July 2013 and in January this year, his term was extended for three years
 rigerv bank ke bheetar urjit patel ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah badi meeting or mulaakaaten karne se bachate hai
 This 'habit' of his is different from his earlier deputy governors, who were often busy with public events
 vah bhaashanadi bhi kam dete hai or vah media main intervyuu dene main bhi unki dilchaspee kam rahati he
 Usually in a 'deserted' manner or can be said to work in solitude and are sometimes described as short-tempered

 He also gives less speech and he is less interested in giving interviews in the media
 aamtaur par 'nirjan' tareeke se yaa kaha ja saktaa he ki ekant main kaam karte hai or kai baar tunakmizaaj bhi qaraar die jate hai
 An officer who worked with Dr

 It will be necessary to do this to deal with the bad loans to the RBI, which is about 8 lakh crore rupees
 doctor patel ke sarkari adhikariyon ke saath sauhardpurn sambandh hai
 These could be better in a new role
 jabaki, doctor raghuram rajan piem modi kii bhartiya janata party ke kuch sadasyon ke nishane par aksar rahe
 Another senior RBI official who has worked with Urjit Patel said - He is very emotional and takes a pragmatic and sensible attitude towards the government's displeasure

 The comments doctor patel doctor rajan kii tarah niveshkon ke bich acchhee saakh rakhte hai
 Considered a close ally of Raghuram Rajan, Patel is known as a strong soldier of Rajan, who has a front against inflation
 vah samiti ke adhyaksh rahe hai, jisane thok mulyon kii jagah khudara mulyon ko mahangaai kaa nayaa maanak banaae jane sahit kai ahm badlaav laae

 a 15-year-old teenager gang-raped a 15-year-old teenager, along with his colleagues, in Uttar Pradesh's Noida, Delhi, in a bid to find the treasure
 tantric ne kishori se kaha ki agar vah uske saath shaareerik sambandh banaaegi to use jameen main gada hua khajaana milegaa
 Deputy Superintendent of Police Ajay Chaudhary said that the father of a 15-year-old teenager living in the village of Prithla has lodged a report in police station 3 that Jeetu Namaskar demonetised her daughter that if she would have a physical relationship with him, she would find a treasure buried in her house
 Will go
 aarope he ki tantric jitu kumaar or uske sahyogi saraswati thakur, arvind thakur or yishu ne kishori ko nashila padaarth sungha diya
 After that these people took him to Dadri
 jahaan ek kamare main kishori ke saath un logon ne samuhikbalaatkaarakia
 After the incident, the teenager somehow reached her home and heard the family
 maamle kii report darj kar police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 However, the accused are still out of the grip of the police
 dilli gang rape ke baad gaiyr jimmedrana bayanon kaa silsilaa abhi bhi thama nahin he
 The latest example is that of Mumbai Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh
 satyapal singh kaa kahana he ki gang rape jaisi vaardaat ke liye shikshan santhaan kasuurvaar hai
 How can one save their skin by praying for the sacraments, someone should ask the chief of Mumbai Police
 police kamishnar satyapal singh ne majaburi kaa naam shiksha bataa diya or ghoshnaa kar di ki desh ko jhakzor dene vaale dilli gangrape ke peeche kuch or nahin, skulon kii padhai-likhaai he
 The commissioner said that the gang-rape that took place inside Delhi is a result of upscaling
 hamaare skulon main jo shiksha di jaati he, wo sanskarahin shiksha di jaati he jivan mulya koi sikhaata nahin he
 Someone should ask Satyapal Singh, why Delhi gang rape is not an issue of law and order
 kamishnar satyapal kaa darshanik man raat saadhe nau baje hui is ghatana ko pulisia laaparvaahee kaa mudda kyon nahin maanata? kya satyapal singh ke jehan main ek baar bhi ye baat nahin ai ki ek anaam ladki kii maut par aitihaasik jajbaat dikhaa hukumat ko hilaa dene vaale bachche bhi isi desh ke schuli parivesh main paley bade hai
 In an attempt to make the uniform unblemished by removing the hair, Satyapal Singh argued in the same way as many lies have to be made to hide a lie
 unhone padhai kaa aatmahatya se sambandh ke bare main kaha, aatmahatya anpadh aadmi nahin karata, yani padhane se gadabad ho rahi he
 Studying such studies, due to which man is committing suicide
 jitne log aatmahatya karne vaale hai, zyaadaatar angreji padhane vaale karte hai
 Illiterate people do not commit suicide and those who study English commit suicide
 pataa nahin kis padhai ne kamishnar sahab ko sikhaaya he ki aankadon ke andar se arth kii jagah anarth dhunde jate hai

 log unhen ‘netaji’ kahkar bulaayaa karte the
 He had contributed significantly to the independence of the country
 ‘deshbhakton ke is deshbhakt’ nen angrejon ke chakke chhudaa die the
 Netaji, who blew the bugle against the British in the freedom struggle, died on 18 August 1945
 media reports ke mutabik unke maut kaa rahasy unke chale jane ke baad bhi rahasy bana hua he
 Many committees came, gave their reports, but the real truth could not be revealed
 pradhanmantri badalte rahe par rahasy par se pardaa na uth sakaa
 Of course, the truth of his death can be revealed after the file has been revealed by the central government
 netaji se jude rahasy or unki sachai
 
 
 Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, Odisha
 unke pita kaa naam janakinath bose or maa kaa naam prabhavati tha
 Jankinath was a famous lawyer of Cuttack
 prabhavati or janakinath bose kii kul milakar 14 santaanen thi jisamen 6 betiyaan or 8 bete the
 Subhash was his ninth child and fifth son
 katak main praathmik shiksha puri karne ke baad unhone revensha koligiet skool main daakhila liya
 After which he studied at the University of Calcutta
 1919 main bie kii pariksha unhone pratham shrenee se paas kii, uniwarsity main unhen doosraa sthaan mila tha
 This engineer left a package of millions, started the work of selling tea
 His father's desire was that Subhash should become ICS
 unhone apane pita kii yah ichha puri kii
 He got the fourth position in the 1920 ICS examination but Subhash was not inclined to work under the British
 22 april 1921 ko unhone is pad se tyaagptr de diya
 Subhash Chandra Bose first met Gandhiji on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji kii salaah par ve bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke liye kaam karne lage
 Along with India's independence, their involvement in social work also remained
 bengal kii bhayankar baadh main ghire logon ko unhone bhojan, vastra or surakshit sthanon par pahunchane kaa sahaspurn kaam kiya tha
 To keep the work of social service going on regularly, he established a 'yuva Dal'
 bhagat singh ko faansee kii sajaa se reeha karaane ke liye ve jail se prayaas kar rahe the
 For his release, he spoke to Gandhiji and said that he should break the agreement with the British on the issue of release
 is samjhaute ke tahat jail se bhartiya kaidiyon ke liye rihaai maangi gai thi
 Gandhiji did not agree to break the promise given to the British Government, after which Bhagat Singh was hanged
 is ghatana ke baad ve gandhi or congress ke kaam karne ke tareeke se bahut naaraaz ho gaye the
 Subhash was sentenced to a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 ko chah maheene kaa karawas diya gaya tha
 He was scheduled to appear in a Calcutta court in connection with a case in 1941, when he left his home and reached Germany
 germany main unhone hitler se mulaakaat kii
 He formed the Azad Hind Fauj to wage war against the British and also gave the slogan of 'you give me blood, i will give you freedom'

 During the journey, the plane crashed at Taihoku Airport, killing him
 unki maut bharat ke itihaas kaa sabase bada rahasy bani hui he
 There is a lot of speculation from time to time on his mysterious death
 aapako bataaden bharat sarkaar ne RTI ke jawaab main ye baat saafe taur par kahi he ki unki maut ek vimaan haadase main hui thi
 At the same time, according to many government facts, on August 18, 1945, Netaji was going to Manchuria by airplane and after this flight he disappeared
 haalanki, japan kii ek sanstha ne usee saal 23 agast ko ye khabar jari kiya ki netaji kaa vimaan taiwan main durghatnagrast ho gaya tha jiske kaaran unki maut ho gai
 Teachers will not be able to go to class with mobile, know why? But according to media reports, the Japanese government itself had confirmed that, on August 18, 1945, there was no plane crash in Taiwan
 isliye aaj bhi netaji kii maut kaa rahasy khul nahin paaya he
 Netaji Subhash Chandra of Azad Hind had said that a person may die but not his thoughts, thoughts remain alive even after his death and affect thousands

 Advani in his latest blog welcomed the suggestion of the Supreme Court that people should have the right to negative voting
 unhone haalanki iske saath kaha ki matdaan ke praavdhaan ko anivaary banaaya janaa chahie
 Advani said, 'the situation today is that the voter who does not use the Constitution-given valuable right to cast his vote without any valid reason, unintentionally votes negatively against all the candidates
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘isliye meraa maananaa he ki nakaaratmak vot arthpurna hoga, agar iske saath hi matdaan ko anivaary bana diya jaae
 ' punjab neshnal bank mahaghotaale kii paraten minute-dar-minute khulti ja rahi hai
 In this scam of about 11 and half thousand crores, there are reports of misuse of some rules of banks
 letters of anderteking or swift transfar jaisi vyavasthaaon kii andekhi is ghotaale ke liye jimmedaar he
 We are telling you what is Letter of Undertaking (lou) and Swift and how these transactions take place
 lou kya he?letters of anderteking (lou) ek tarah se bank guarantee hoti he
 It is issued to make overseas payments for imports
 lou jari karne vaala bank guaranter ban jaataa he or vah apane client ke lone par principal amount or us par lagane vaale byaaj ko beshart bhugtan karnaa sweekaar karata he
 When lou is issued, it includes the issuing bank, the accepting bank, the importer and the company benefiting from it abroad
 pienbi ke maamle main farji lou hasil kiye gaye or inhen ke aadhaar par exis or elahabaad jaise bainkon kii videshi shakhaon se lone liye gaye the
 SWIFT has also been misused saying that PNB employees also misused 'SWIFT' for the transaction of money
 iske jariye ve rojaanaa kii banking tranjactions ko proces karne vaale kor banking system (CBS) ko chakma de gaye
 Through this, they passed the guarantee given on lous without the necessary approval
 isi ke aadhaar par bhartiya bainkon kii videsh main sthit branches ne karj diya
 What is SWIFT? Whenever lou is issued on behalf of a bank
 iske baad credit transfar kii jaankaree videsh main sthit bank ko di jaati he
 This information is given through the SWIFT (society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) system
 yah ek ahm jaankaree hoti he, jiske jariye bank apni sahmati or guarantee detaa he
 In order to give information about SWIFT, the bank official has to submit a collage and confidential information has to be entered in it
 isamen acount number or SWIFT code shaamil hota he
 In general, it has three layers
 kor banking system (CBS) main ek 'mekar (code taiyaar karne vaala), chekar (jaanch karne vaala) or veryphire (jaankaree pukhta karne vaala) hota he, jinase guzarane ke baad hi yah jari hota he
 Actually, 'SWIFT' messages are not immediately tracked in pnb's Pinnacle software system as they are issued without entering the bank's CBS
 isi kaa phayda pienbi ke do karmchaariyon ne uthaaya or karodon kaa len-dein kiya
 What is CBS? Core banking system or CBS is the system to which all the branches of the bank are connected
 sibies hi he, jisaki vajah se aap bank kii kisi bhi branch se apana acount oparate kar pate hai or paise bhej pate hai
 After this arrangement, you become a customer of a bank and not a branch
 yahaan par banking system main hone vaale har tranjaction ko real time par apadet kiya jaataa he
 In the case of PNB Mahaghotale, the employees did not send the details of the transaction to CBS
 yahi vajah thi ki bank ko is ghotaale kaa pataa us samay nahin lag paaya

 China may not allow Mansarovar travelers from our country to go there
 lakh adnge lagaae, china hamaari simaaon kaa lagaataar atikaraman karata rahe or uski in harkaton par jab puraa desh ek sur main china kii ninda karata ho to aise main hamaare desh ke ek nami aadhyatmik sant in baton ko lekar china kaa bachaav karen, yah baat samaj se baahar he
 Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Arena and the famous saint Pilot Baba are immersed in the love of the Chinese dragon
 unhen china ke rashtriya chinh maane jane vaale dragon se itnaa lagaav he ki ve apane har ashram main sabase pehle vishalkay dragon kii murtiyon lagavaana pasand karte hai
 This dragon love of a saint is truly shocking
 dharm nagari haridwar main june akhaade ke sabase taqatvar maane jane vaale payalat baba kaa ganga kinare bhavy ashram he
 Nowadays this ashram is being made a giant
 bataa den ki ye ashram unheen payalat baba kaa he jinaki sant samaaj or june akhaade main tuuti bolti he
 It is believed that Baba is the biggest dhan-kubera among the saints of the Akharas and also has its weight
 vajah yah he ki baba ke desh hi nahin, videshon main bhi khub bhakt faile hai
 Among the foreign devotees of Baba, the number of Chinese devotees is more
 payalat baba ke ashramon main vaise to devi-devataaon or mahapurushon kii pratimaaon kii bharmaar he
 But the biggest feature of Baba's ashrams is that the giant Chinese dragon appears prominently in his ashrams
 payalat baba ko dragon itnaa lubhaata he ki is dragon kii pratimaaon ko ve apane har ashram main lagavate hai
 Pilot Baba has also faced opposition many times due to the love of the dragon
 jab payalat baba kaa uttarkashi main ashram ban rah tha to us ashram main bhi vishalkay dragon lagavaaye gaye the, is par sthaneey logon ne aapatti jataai or vahaan jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 Seeing the people's opposition, he not only had to remove the idols of the dragon from the ashram, but he also had to leave the ashram of Uttarkashi forever
 lekin is virodh ke baad bhi payalat baba kaa dragon prem kam nahin hua
 You can see the statues of the dragon at the doors before Baba enters inside each ashram
 payalat baba ke haridwar main ban rahe ashram main bhi dragon ko sthapit kiya gaya he
 Surprisingly, Baba believes in his dragon love and he also compares it to the national symbol of India
 agar aapako lagata he ki payalat baba ko sirf chini dragon se hi pyaar he to aap galat hai
 Baba's love is very good for China
 baba ko lagata he ki bharat ko china se koi khatra nahin he, yahi nahin payalat baba china kii tarifon ke aise kaside padhate hai jaise ve china ke rashtriya pravaktaa hon
 The government is also instructing Baba
 The government has also shown Baba a fear of law
 pichley dinon china ne naa keval kai jagah bhartiya seemaa main atikaraman kiya balki apane nakshe main kashmir ke ek bhaag ko or puure arunachal ko apane nakshe main dikhaane kii himakat kii thi, jisase deshbhar ke logo main china ko lekar gussa bhar gaya tha
 In such a country, a saint on whom millions of people trust and if he defends China in such sensitive times, then people will doubt the patriotism of that saint

 -input language uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara bulaai gai mukhyamantriyon kii baithak main anurodh kiya ki kendriya plan bajet kaa kam se kam 50 fisadi hissaa rajyon ko ekamusth uplabdh karaayaa jaae, taaki rajya sarkarein sthaneey jaruraton ke hisaab se yojanaayen chalaa saken
 'change is necessary in the changed situation with liberalization' Akhilesh Yadav said that 26 percent of the total budget of the center is in the form of plan budget
 unamem se kendriya mantralayon ke paas kul 85 pratishat aavanton chalaa jaataa he or rajyon ke liye block grant ke rup main sirf 15 pratishat bhaag hi rah jaataa he
 Therefore, the system should be that instead of keeping a large portion of the budget with the Center, it should be given to the states
 akhilesh yadav ne ravivaar ko nai dilli main kaha ki centre dwaara sanchalit kaaryakramon se sabhi rajya saamaanya rup se labhanvit nahin hote hai
 There are also some programs, which few states are able to benefit from, because the conditions and restrictions imposed in the programs make it difficult
 vittiya sansadhano kaa aavanton paardarshee dhang se rajyon ke bich kiya jaae or is bantwaare main pichde kshetron or rajyon kii jaruraton ko variyata di jaae
 He said that at least 90 percent grant amount should be made available to the states under the schemes, because the centrally run schemes are facing a huge financial burden on the states
 is tarah ke kaaryakramon se rajyon kii aarthik sthiti par anaavashyak dabaav aata he or kuch maamalon main aise dayitvon ko nibhaane main bhi rajya sarkarein apane ko asahaay paati hai
 Emphasizing that the states should be given complete freedom to run schemes as per their need, Akhilesh said that detailed consultations should be held with the state governments before finalizing the five-year plans
 mukhyamantri ne suzav diya ki yojana ayog ke swaroop main centre or rajyon kii samaan bhagidaari honi chahie, jisase samuhik rup se bina kisi bhedbhaav ke rajyon ke sarvageen vikaas sangrakshit ho saken or sangheey dhaanche ko majboot aadhaar mil sake
 Akhilesh said that states have their own priorities, so the same policy cannot be effective on all states
 nitiyon main lacheelaapan jaruri he, taaki rajya apni aarthik, saamaajik va bhugolic paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue usamen badlaav kar saken
 He said that before considering the design of the Planning Commission, it would have been more beneficial if the states had been provided with a copy of its outline and taken a view on it

 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah 9 july ko jab chennai main party ke mahashakti centre or shakti centre ke prabhariyon se mili to unhen yah bataaya gaya ki "vipakshi dal yah kah kar party kaa uphaas uda rahe hai ki tamilnadu main bhaajapa dhundne se bhi nahin milti he
 "with a slight smile, Shah replied," If the opposition wants to find the BJP in Tamil Nadu, then find it in the evms in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isamen koi sanshay nahin ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tamilnadu main bhaajapa badi takat ban kar ubharne vaali he
 "he also announced," We will announce an alliance in Tamil Nadu at an appropriate time before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 jiske saath bhi gathbandhan karenge, yah sunishchit hoga ki rajya bhrashtachar se mukt hokar vikaas ke path par agrasar ho
 "shah's statement is not unintentional
" darasal, unhone tamilnadu ke saath hi un rajyon se bhi pichley do loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon kaa puraa byora lekar bhavi yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar liya he jahaan party kii upasthiti naam maatr he
 The BJP is looking for alliances with small parties (registered but unrecognized) to make its electoral performance effective in such states
 aise dalon se sampark saadhane kaa silsilaa bhi shuru ho gaya he
 This strategy of BJP is also appropriate for Shah's goal in which he has talked about increasing bjp's vote percentage to 50 percent in 2019
 anaupchaarik baatcheet main bhaajapa ke netaa yah maanate hai ki odisha, kerala, andhra pradesh, telugana or pashchim bengal jaise rajyon ke sattadhari dal yaa mukhyamantri itane kaddavar hai ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in rajyon main safalataa hasil karnaa party ke liye kathin he
 At the same time, in the last Lok Sabha elections, in the states where BJP performed well in the triangular or multi-cornered contest, anti-bjp parties are mobilizing
 inamen uttar pradesh, maharashtra, bihar, jharkhand dilli, haryana or purvottar ke rajya shaamil hai
 Even though the influential parties of these states are opposed to each other, but in order to save their existence and stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi, all differences are united by forgetting
 iskaa khamiyaja pichley kuch maheenon ke dauraan hue upachunaavon main bhaajapa ko bhugatna bhi padaa he
 Even in states where BJP is directly facing Congress, the path of BJP is not looking as smooth as 2014
 masalan, gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, goa
 In these states, BJP also realizes the anti-incumbency trend
 amit shah yah baat kai baar doharaa chuke hai, "jin rajyon main 2014 main party ko badi safalataa mili thi, vahaan kuch siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 We will compensate this deficiency from other states
 coromandal rajya or tateey rajyon main bhaajapa ko 2019 main acchhee safalataa milegi
 "for the last two years, he has also put his team to work on 150 such seats, where BJP has a nominal presence
" bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, "yah sach he ki tamilnadu, kerala, andhra pradesh, odisha, pashchim bengal yaa telugana main party ek takat to he par akele seat jeetne kii sthiti main nahin he
 But this is only one aspect of the coin
 sikke kaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki bhaajapa in rajyon main chote-chote sahyogi dalon ko apane saath jod kar vahaan bade dal ko takkar dene kii sthiti main aegi
 He argues that the BJP did this in Tripura
 vahaan ke chote-chote dalon ko saath jod kar bhaajapa ne rajya main apane boote bahumat hasil kar liya
 In the last Lok Sabha election, Apna Dal in Uttar Pradesh and again in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections of 2017 achieved great success by compromising with Om Prakash Rajbhar's party
 bhaajapa ke ranneetikaar maanate hai ki puure desh main 70 se adhik aisi choti-choti partiyaan hai jo bhale hi apane dam par chunaav nahin jeet sakati hai, lekin in dalon ke paas 50 hajaar se lekar 10 lakh tak vot hai
 These votes may seem small in terms of Lok Sabha elections, but if these parties join the BJP, then it can achieve great success even in those states where it is currently considered weak
 inamen se kai chote dalon kii pakad kisaanon ke bich acchhee he
 Some parties have their own identity in the labor organizations and some in the spiritual world
 masalan, pegent and workars party of india trade union se judaa rajnatik dal he
 Its influence is in Ramgarh, Solapur, Nagpur, Nanded, Nashik in Maharashtra as well as parts of Andhra Pradesh
 is dal kaa chaatro ke bich bhi acha kaam he or iskaa purogami yuva sanghathan naamak chaatr sanghathan kaabhi prabhavi he
 This party wins one or two seats in the assembly, but has not been able to achieve great success in the Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa ke ranneetikaron ke mutabik, in dalon ke vot agar bhaajapa ko transfar hote hai to jin siton par bhaajapa 50 hajaar se lekar 1 lakh ke vot se harati he vahaan uske pratyaashee jeet hasil kar sakate hai
 For instance, in Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu, bjp's ally MDMK secured 1,89,386 votes and PTP 2,61,757 votes
 agar donon ke vot jod liye jaae to yah vijayi eiediemke ko mili 4,24,586 vot se 26,557 vot adhik hai
 Obviously, smaller parties can prove to be important in many seats
 shah saaf kar chuke hai ki 2019 main vipakshi dalon se bada kunba rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kaa hoga
 So to increase the nda's clan, the anonymous Odisha Party, Bahujan Mukti Party, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh, Gondwana Republic Republic Party, Jayabharata Parity Party, Jai Samyak Andhra Party, Loksatta Party, Manithanaya Makkal Katchi (MMK), Puthia Tamilagam (PT) ), Pyramid Party of India, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, VCK, Welfare Party of India; Dnhe doing the work
 iske liye rajyon ke sanghathan mantri ko jimmedaari di gai he
 In each booth booth officers have been given written instructions to get the last two Lok Sabha and two assembly election figures from the organization minister to meet the margin of the booths where the party was trailed by 1,000 to 5,000 votes
 Which small team needs to be aligned
 kyon najar he chote dalon parabhajapa ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj kuch bade dalon ke saath hi gathjod kiya tha
 At other places, only small parties were included in the NDA clan
 maharashtra main shivasena or andhra pradesh main telegu desham party (tidipi) hi bhaajapa ke saath thim
 In informal conversations, BJP leaders say that there is more dependence on big parties
 baat bigadgaye kii sambhaavna bhi adhik hoti he
 This has happened many times with the BJP
 masalan, pichley dinon tidipi ne bhaajapa kaa saath chhod diya
 Shiv Sena is also rebuking
 isse bhaajapa ke liye asahaj sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 The BJP has been so strong since 2014 that it has won a majority on its own and is still in that position
 lekin chote dal isliye lajimi hai kyonki jin siton par kam margin se jeet-haar hoti he, vahaan in dalon ke saath aane se bhaajapa kii sthiti behatar hogi or jeet kii sambhaavna banegi
 In the last elections in Bihar, alliance with Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, Apna Dal in Uttar Pradesh, Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra and Ramdas Athawale's RPI worked well
 aise main chote dal bhaajapa ke liye behatar sahyogi sabit ho sakate hai
 Citing the example of Tamil Nadu, a BJP leader says that in the last Lok Sabha election, out of 39 BJP could win only one seat here
 agar rajya main is baar bhaajapa rajya ke piti, visike jaise chote dal or emdmake yaa piemke jaise apekshaakrit rajya ke majhule dalon se gathjod karti he to thiruvallur, chennai dakshin, shreeperambudur, kanchipuram, arakonam samet 10 loksabhaa siton par rajya ke donon pramukh dalon, diemke or eiediemke ko kadi takkad de sakati he
 bjp's Rajya Sabha MP and head of the media department, Anil Baluni, says, "under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country has developed effectively in the last four years
 pradhanmantri ke kaam or niyat ko dekhte hue bahut se dal endie main shaamil hone kii ichha rakhte hai
 It is certain that in 2019 the nda's clan will be bigger than 2014
 dal chota ho yaa bada, sabhi kaa apana mahatv he
 BJP gives equal respect to all parties
 ''sadhana nahin asanalekin chote dalon ko saath lenaa bhaajapa ke liye aasaan nahin he
 Small parties are understanding its importance well this time
 in dalon ko lagata he ki bhaajapa ke saath jane se ek-do seat bhale mil jaae, lekin chunaav jeetne ke baad bhi phayda bhaajapa ko hi hoga
 You will not be in a position to pressure the BJP on one or two mps
 shetakari sanghathan ke raju shetty kehete hai, "jin baton ko lekar bhaajapa sahyog maangati he usase baad main mukar jaati he
 In 2014, we went with the BJP for the interests of farmers, but after forming the government, it ignored our talk about the problem of farmers and we had to move away from the BJP
 ''vahiin tamilnadu ke piti party ke netaa doctor ke
 Krishnasamy says, "all the parties who come to talk about alliances with us know our importance
 par hamaara kaam sirf ek yaa do saansadon ko jitna nahin he balki yah jaananaa jaruri he ki ve hamaari vichaardhaara ko kitni ahmiyat dete hai
 If there was talk of reaching Parliament only, then why would we form our own party, we would have joined Congress or BJP
 ''isi tarah maharashtra kii bharip bahujan mahasang ke netaa prakaash ambedkar bhi bhaajapa kii kadi aalochana karte rahe hai
 An official of the more active Pyramid Party in Andhra Pradesh says, "we are well aware that some big parties want to serve their interests with our support, but they should understand very well what we want
" chunki shaakaahaar, parforming art or aadhyatmikta hamaari mul vichaardhaara he, so jo bhi inaki baat karegaa ham uske saath jane ke mudde par vichaar kar sakate hai
 "the Congress also has an idea of the importance of small parties
 It is evident from this that it is not only the BJP but the Congress too is watching them
" congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep surajevaala kehete hai, "desh main jis tarah kaa maahaul he usamen koi badi party ho yaa choti, sabake adhikaron kaa daman kiya ja rahaa he
 Everyone is realizing this
 isliye congress un sabhi dalon se sahyog kii apeksha karti he jo is desh kii bahulata main yakeen karti hai
 No party is untouchable for the Congress
 jahaan tak baat gathbandhan or seat bantwaare kii he to congress main e
 K
 antni cameti iske liye adhikrut he
 She will consider this subject
 loktantr kii raksha ke liye jaruri he ki chote-bade sabhi dal ek saath aaen
 "A Congress leader says," Many smaller parties are ideologically close to the Congress
 chaahe vah tamilnadu kaa memke ho yaa hindi pattee kaa kaumi ekta dal yaa maharashtra kaa rashtriya samaaj paksh
 Surjewala, while taking a sarcasm at the BJP, says, "the way the BJP is now trying to help small parties in every state, it is clear that it is assuming that any big party in any state Not willing to go with him
 jo saath main the ve chhodkar chale gaye or kuch chhod kar jane ko taiyaar baithe hai
 "the way the big parties are currently trying to defeat each other in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it will increase the importance of smaller parties and they can also play an important role in winning and losing many seats
" 
 jaahir he, sthaneey or chote-chote mudde loksabhaa chunaav ko bhale hi bahut prabhavit nahin karte hon, par jin siton par kaante kaa muqabla hoga vahaan chote dalon ke saath unke mudde bhi nirnaayak bhoomika main ho sakate hai
 *** prasiddh itihaaskaar or jeevani lekhak ramchandra guha kaa kahana he ki 'lagaataar patan' kii ore ja rahi congress party ko 'netritv main badlaav' se hi ubaara ja saktaa he
 Along with this, he suggested that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar should be made the president of Congress
 haalanki guha ne is suzav ko apni 'fantasy' qaraar diya or kaha ki agar jediu adhyaksh nitish 'dostana tareeke se' congress party kaa kaarybhaar sambhalate hai to yah 'jananath main bani jodi' kii tarah hogi
 On the 10th anniversary of his book 'india After Gandhi', at the release of its revised edition, Guha said, 'I am saying this because the Congress is a party without a leader and Nitish is a party without a leader
 ' unhone kaha ki nitish ek 'vaazib' netaa hai
 Guha said in a program, 'like Modi, there is no family burden on him
 lekin modi kii tarah vah atmamugdh nahin hai
 He is not communal and pays attention to gender issues, these things are rarely seen among Indian leaders
 nitish main kuch chijen hai jo apil karti thim or apil karti hai
 He said that till the Congress president does not hand over this post to Nitish, he or Sonia Gandhi have no future in Indian politics
 'stanbhakaar-lekhak guhaane kaha ki 131 saal puraani congress ab koi badi raajnneetik takat nahin ban sakati or loksabhaa main apni maujuuda 44 siton ko bhavishya main badhaakar zyada se zyada 100 kar sakati he
 Referring to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Guha said, 'now if tomorrow they become a new leader or leadership, things can change
 raajnneeti main do saal lanbaa vakt hota he
 He said that the fall of Congress is also 'worrying', because a one-party system is not a 'good thing' for democracy
 vampanth or dakshinpanth donon ke aalochakamaane jane vaale guha ne kaha, 'ek hi party ke shashan ne to jawaharlal nehru jaise bade loktantrvaadi netaa ko bhi ahamkaari bana diya tha
 This made the already autocratic Indira Gandhi more autocratic
 aise main narendra modi or amit shah ko yah cheez kaisaa bana degi, iske bare main maine sochna shuru kar diya he
 Guha said that India has failed to adopt the two-party permanent model of Western democracies
 unhone kaha ki rajyon main do party kii pratidwandvita ko kamjor nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He said, 'the three states of India that have performed well in the last 70 years according to the Economic and Social Index include Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Himachal Pradesh
 
 
 or in sabhi main tulanaatmak taur par do party vaali sthaayee pranali he
 Guha, citing the example of West Bengal (left Front) and Gujarat (BJP), said that states that had a single party government for a long time proved to be 'disastrous'
 unhone kaha, 'jin rajyon main sthaayee taur par do party vaali pranali hoti he, ve behtareen pradarshan karte hai, kyonki kerala main congress vamapanthiyon par lagaam rakhti he, jabaki himachal main bijepi congress par lagaam rakhti he
 The revised edition of the book published in 2007 by Pan mcmillan India includes new chapters on gender, caste and many other issues including the rise of the gay movement in India

 After every incident of communal violence, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav transferred the District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police only in the name of action
 kisi hinsagrast jagah kaa unhone daura bhi nahin kiya
 Experts believe that the frequent incidents of communal violence are not coming to an end as the state government has so far failed to give a strong message on such incidents

 They know that there will be nothing more than a transfer from the government, the need is to give a strong message by suspending or taking more action, which instills fear in their mind and they should perform their duty responsibly

 Posted byryoton Wednesday, September 23, 2015 The terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) has devastated Iraq's historic city of Nimrud
 ravivaar ko IS dwaara jari ek video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki IS ke aatankiyon ne kis tarah dhamaakaa karke is aitihaasik shahar ko barbaad kar diya
 What date is the video released by IS, it is not yet clear
 lekin is video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki mosul se 30 kilometre dur sthit is shahar ko IS ne dhamaakon se samtal kar diya he
 The IS is believed to have carried out the incident about a month ago
 haalanki abhi tak shahar ko hue nuksaan kaa jayja nahin liya ja sakaa he
 Let me tell you that for the past few days IS militants have damaged many ancient and historical cities of Iraq
 kuch din pehle bhi aatankiyon ne nimrud shahar ke pracheen shilpakalaon ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya tha
 Significantly, the city of Nimrud was discovered in 1820
 is shahar ko 2003 main america hamale ke dauraan bhi kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 The election campaign in Gujarat is over
 kaaphi kadavi chunavi ladaai ke baad ab guuruuvaar shaam tak gujarat ke voter bijepi or congress donon kii takadir iviem main sil kar denge
 The picture of the most awaited assembly election results of recent years will be clear by 11 am on Monday
 india today tivi ke kansalting editor or lokapriy prime time sho news today ke host rajdeep saradesai ne rajya kii raajnneetik dhadkan ko samajhane ke liye puure gujarat kaa daura kiya
 On the basis of their intense electoral reporting, they are telling the 10 main things of Gujarat election: 1
 modi kaa jaadu:narendra modi kaa gujaratiyon ke dil par raaj kaayam he
 He has contested and won three consecutive elections as the Chief Minister in the state
 aaj vah mukhyamantri pad ke liye nahin lard rahe, phir bhi yah chunaav unke karishme par hi ladaa ja rahaa he
 No other leader has the kind of connection he has with Gujaratis
 2
 Rahul's new avatar: Rahul Gandhi, who has been struggling for almost a decade and is seen working reluctantly in politics, has got a new look
 vah jis urja se gujarat chunaav lard rahe hai, usase unke tamaam aalochak bhi chakit ho gaye hai
 He is not his main rival like Bold, but he has made a place in the hearts of people by his soft, generous attitude of being a good listener instead of a big speaker
 yadi vah apane is ubhaar ko vastav main voton main badal paae, to 2019 main ek tagdi ladaai dekhne ko mil sakati he
 3
 eks factor:patelon ke garh main ek nayaa netaa ubhara he or vah is chunaav kaa eks factor yani chaunkaane vaali khaas takat ban chukaa he
 Hardik Patel has become a warrior who took the fight to the streets, which made it impossible for the BJP to be unilateral
 congress ko apane ubhaar kaa kaaphi had tak shrey hardik patel ko dena hoga
 He has a strong fighting spirit like Mamata Banerjee, arrogance like Kejriwal and sharp-edged speech like Bal Thackeray
 vah aaj ke mutabik takat or bhavishya ke netaa hai
 4
 gujarat model:gujarat model par sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 This election has thrown such light on the development of Gujarat as never before, due to this its flaws have also been exposed
 ji haa,gujarat nebhautik buniyadi dhaanche ke nirmaan kii disha main acha kaam kiya he, lekin saamaajik or seva kshetra main uskaa pradarshan kharaab he
 Modi's Gujarat model has become hazy with education and health being completely entrusted to private hands
 isliye 'vikaas gando thayo' banaam 'hu vikaas chhun' kii ladaai main avadharana kii ladaai bahut nichle str tak pahunch gai he
 5
 vibhaajan kaa khel:rajya main gaanvon or shaharon main bahut fark ho gaya he
 Shiny new flyovers and tall buildings are seen in the cities, so there is a lot of backwardness in rural Gujarat
 aisa lagata he ki patel factor ke baavjood shaharon kii zyaadaatar seat par bijepi jeet jaaegi, lekin gramin gujarat riyaayat baratane vaala nahin he
 The Panchayat system in the state has been broken long back
 kisaan pareshaan hai or gaanvon main padhe-likhe yaa anpadh donon tarah ke yuvaaon main berogari kaa alam he
 6
 aarthik masale:gujarati jiesti or notebandi ko apnaane ke liye taiyaar tha, lekin tab jab 'kaarobaar prabhavit na hota
 Demonetisation and GST have proved to be a double whammy for Gujarati businessmen in small and medium enterprises
 gussa shaayad isliye bhi zyada he, kyonki kaarobaar anukool maane jane vaale gujarati piem kii sarkaar unki shikaayatein sunne ko taiyaar nahin he
 This anger can go against the government run by an anonymous type of CM
 7
 Muslims are not an issue: From Mian Musharraf to the Mughals, Mian Ahmed Patel and Salman Nizami, hardly any state has attempted such an easy and legal attempt to polarize communities, as it did in Gujarat
 in sabake baavjood gujarat kii jansankhya main 10 fisadi hissedari rakhane vaale musalamaanon kii koi baat nahin kar rahaa
 Even the Congress did not discuss 2002 once this time in the elections and Rahul Gandhi kept going for temple-temple darshan
 8
 Caste politics: Caste politics in Gujarat is of a different kind
 yahaan jati to mahatvapurn he, lekin dalon ke aadhaar par baantne vaali nahin he
 The Patel solidarity is seen behind Hardik Patel, though a section of him will vote for the BJP
 saurashtra ke coli dakshin gujarat ke coliyon se alag vot kar sakate hai, dalit or adivasee bhi bante hue hai or obisi shaayad alpesh thakor ke mutabik na chalem
 Just as BJP needs Hindutva Plus for its expansion, in the same way Congress needs Cast Plus politics to expand its voter base
 9
 Who will win Gujarat: The biggest question is, who will win Gujarat? But this is quite a complex question
 kareeb do dashakon se gujarat bijepi kaa majboot kila rahaa he
 Amit Shah has built a strong organization in the state from booth worker to top
 gujarat modi-shah kaa gharelu maidan he
 The Congress has also started working on it
 congress ke liye phaayde kii baat yah he ki sarkaar ke khilaaf ek tarah kaa andercurent he
 So the question of who will win is impossible to find before 18
 10
 Satyvm Jayate: Despite all the grievances, EVM tampering complaints are proving to be lack of any strong and unbroken evidence
 haarane vaale hi iviem main chhedchhad kii shikaayat karte rahe hai or bharat kii bahudaleey loktantrit vyavastha main aaj koi dal kisi rajya main jeetta he to doosraa dal duusare kisi rajya main jeet saktaa he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has reached there without the approval of the administration for the tour in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, which is struggling with violent incidents
 prashasan ne rahul ke helicopter ko saharanpur main utaarne kii ijaajat nahin di he, wo sadak maarg se saharanpur pahunch rahe hai
 All the political statements are coming to light when Rahul Gandhi is not approved by the UP administration for the tour
 bijepi is faisle ko ilaake main shanti banaae rakhane ke liye jaruri bataa rahi he, vahiin vipaksh ise aparaadhiyon ko bachaane kii sajeesh qaraar de rahaa he
 The BJP said in a briefing on Rahul, Minister SN Singh said that the situation had worsened when BSP supremo Mayawati reached Saharanpur, so the administration did not allow Rahul Gandhi to visit
 bijepi netaa or upi sarkaar main mantri shrikant sharma ne kaha ki rahul gandhi and company frustation main he
 He said that Rahul Gandhi is a Tragedy Tourist, where Tragedy happens, he definitely goes
 aparaadhiyon ko bachaa rahi upi sarkaaris maamle par congress netaa randeep surejwaala ne pratikriya di kiraahul gandhi ko dalit bhaaiyonke dukh-dard saajha karne se rokane vaale shri adityanath koun hai
 Such behavior is not tolerable
 upi sarkaar daliton ke aparaadhiyon ko bachaa rahi he
 She cannot suppress the voice of the poor, dalits and tribals of this country
 BJP se yahi ummid thivahin uttar pradesh ke purv siem akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki BJP se or kya apeksha kii ja sakati he
 During the election campaign, the BJP distributed electricity, hindu-muslim and festivals
 hamaari party har prabhavit ilaake kaa daura karegi
 What is the whole matter? a dispute that took place during the Maharana Pratap procession in Shabbirpur village of Saharanpur took violent form
 iske baad vishesh jati par daliton ke saath atyaachaar karne or unke ghar jalaane kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha
 In this case, a case was registered against Bhim Army leader Chandrashekhar
 iske baad beete ravivaar ko bhim army kaaryakartaaon ne badi sankhya main dilli ke jantar-mantar pahunchakar pradarshan kiya tha
 Significantly, the incidents which occurred here on April 20, May 5, May 9 and May 23 for more than a month have affected the peace loving atmosphere of this district
 is dauraan aisa mahasoos kiya gaya ki kahin na kahin police prashasan kii karypranali main kami rahi or usee kaa nateeja rahaa ki yogi sarkaar ne yahaan prashasnic str par nai team bheji, jo puure maamle kii samiksha karte hue is maahaul ko shant or saamaanya karne me juty he
 The policy says that the beginning of any relationship should be based on the foundation of truth
 jab baat life partner kii talash kii ho, to yah niti ekadam kargar sabit hoti he
 This increases trust in each other and makes the relationship lasting
 par ek survey main yah baat saamne ai he ki zyaadaatar mard pehali date par eemaandaaree nahin baratate hai
 On this beautiful and important occasion, people hide many things from their partner
 survey main shaamil logon main se kareeb 63 fisadi ne kabool kiya ki pehali date par unhone apni tankhwaah ko kaaphi badha-chadhaakar bataaya, taaki mahilaon ko impress kiya ja sake
 Most of these men admitted that it was not wrong to lie on the first date, because the women they met were also not expected to be completely honest
 aadhe se adhik purushon ne kaha ki unhone apane kariyar ko khub behatar banaakar pesh kiya, taaki ve mahila saathiyon ko rijhaa saken
 Not only this, many of them even lied about their hobby

 isi samay lakhanu se 350 kilometre dur purvi jile maharajaganj main bispi ke rashtriya mahasachiv satish chand mishra vahaan ke jawahar laal nehru piji college ke maidan main yojit ek brahmïna sammelan main panditon ko bispi se judye ke phaayde gina rahe the
 This was the second Brahmin conference of the SP in its party office in the last one month, and after conducting a Brahmin brotherhood rally in Lucknow on April 18, the BSP has started similar rallies in the 36 Lok Sabha seats of the state
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon kaa bigul bajte hi partiyon ko brahmanon main achaanak vot bank kyon najar aane laga he? chaar baar pradesh ke mukhyamantri or 1989 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle tak antim brahman mukhyamantri rahe varisht congressi netaa narayan dutt tiwari kehete hai, ''beete varshon main pradesh main sabase zyada brahman hi upekshit hua he
 Now for the first time this class is getting united for its rights
 isi ekajutata main partiyon ko vot bank najar aa rahaa he
 "it is claimed that 12 percent of Brahmins are in UP
 rajya niyojan santhaan ke ek adhikari bataate hai ki 2007 main sultanpur jile main karaae gaye ek survey ke mutabik, yahaan kanya vidya dhan paane vaali chaatraon main kareeb 40 fisadi brahman pariwaron se thim
 Not only this, after the formation of the SP government last year, Brahmins are the highest 40 to 45 percent unemployed
 pichley 20 varshon se upi main lagaatar kam hoti ja rahi naukariyon kii sabase zyada maar brahmanon par hi padi he
 There is anger among the Brahmin community for not getting proper representation in jobs
 pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main 20 aisi hai, jinamein brahman matadaataaon kii sankhya 20 se 25 fisadi hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he or yahaan yah samudaay chunaav main nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 These seats are Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Sitapur, Lucknow, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Amethi, Sultanpur, Bhadohi, Varanasi, Mirzapur, Faizabad, Gonda, Basti, Deoria, Ballia, Khalilabad, Maharajganj, Kushinagar and Ghaziabad
 in 20 loksabhaa siton main lakhanu, varanasi or gajiabad ko chhodkar baaki sabhi pichde jilon se aati hai
 From this one can generally guess that economic backwardness is also a major reason for solidarity among the Brahmin class
 loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon main juty partiyon main sabase pehle sapa ne brahmanon ko apane paale main laane kii koshish shuru kii
 The party took the responsibility of the MLA from Unchahar Assembly of Rae Bareli and Dr

 manoj kumaar pandeya ko saunpa
 Pandey started a series of Brahmin conferences from sp's state headquarters in November last year in more than half the districts of the state
 march main pratapgarh ke kunda main sio jiyaul haq kii hatya ke baad yahaan se vidhayak or tatkaaleen khaadya or naagarik aapurti mantri raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya ko cabinet se baahar kaa rasta dikhaane ke baad thakur votaron ke party se chhitakane ke bhay se sapa ne isaki bharpai brahmanon ko saath jodgaye kii ranneeti akhriyaar karke kii he
 Pandey says, "even after the formation of the government in the state last year, the abolition of reservation in promotion in government jobs has also become extremely popular among SP Brahmin voters
 pramotion main aarakshan hi ek aisa mudda he, jis par bispi brahmïna matadaataaon ke bich baikfoot par he
 "in the promotion, reservation is a constitutional right given to the scheduled castes and tribes," says Swami Prasad Maurya, state spokesperson of the BSP and Leader of Opposition in the assembly
 isse anya jatiyon ke haq par koi aanch nahin aane vaali
 But the opposition parties are misleading all upper caste castes including Brahmins by misleading them on this issue
 ''sapa or bispi agar brahman voton kii jang main kud padi hai to bijepi ko bhi sapa sarkaar kii muslim tushtikaran kii niti ke chalate bane maahaul main brahmanon ke phir se bijepi se judye kii sambhaavna najar aane lagi he
 Senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra says, "the Brahmin voter got away from the party for not getting the Ram Janmabhoomi constructed
 teen saal pehle ise mudde par hycourt ke nirnay ke baad ise aam sahmati se hal karne ke prayaas tej ho gaye hai
 Apart from this, due to the misrule of the governments of SP and BSP, there has arisen in the Brahmin electorate to join the good governance of the BJP
 ''soobe main bijepi, sapa or bispi kii tulana main congress bhale hi chunavi taiyaariyon kii daud main sust ho lekin upi main brahman voton ko hathiyaane kii jang ab jabaani jamaakharch se nikalakar reliyon tak pahunch gai he
 In the coming days, the national parties like BJP and Congress too will not be surprised if they jump with the guns on the shoulders of their Brahmin leaders in this war
