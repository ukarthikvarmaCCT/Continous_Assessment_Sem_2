 In the meantime, Bengaluru is also losing its luck

 Virat Kohli, considered the world's No
1 batsman fighting with luck and failure, will take on the Delhi Capitals this evening
 bengalooru or dilli lagbhag ek jaisi hi sthiti main hai
 The difference is that Delhi's share has somehow won two
 to yah shaayad bengalooru ke liye is sanskaran main jeet kaa khaataa kholane kaa sabase sahi mauka he

 Conquered Kolkata
 kohli ko apni gendbaaji kii chintaa zyada hogi jo kolkata ke khilaaf kabhi bhi ran rokane main safal nahin rahi

 donon ne chah kii ran rate se ran die the or madhya main milakar teen wicket lakar kolkata ko pareshaani main daalaa tha
 Apart from these two, no other bowler could control the runs
 kohli kii chintaa apane gendbaajon ko lay main laane kii hogi kyonki dilli ke paas rishabh pant, shikhar dhawan, prithvi shaw jaise ballebaaj hai jo tufaan khadaa kar sakate hai
 Kohli's captaincy in the Kolkata match was also questioned as he had another world-class spinner in the form of Moin Ali
 aise main jab chahal or negi ne ranon par ankush lagaaya tha to moin bhi bengalooru ke liye kifayati sabit ho sakate the
 Kohli lashed out at the bowlers, saying - even if you cannot save 75 runs in 4 overs, Delhi deserves to be defeated in this match by defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad at home
 hyderabad ke khilaaf uske ballebaajon ne niraash kiya tha

 Law Minister Kapil Sibal said in Ahmedabad on Monday that a judge would be found to investigate Snoopgate
 dilli main bhale hi thand abhi kaayam he, magar chunaav ko lekar raajnneeti kaaphi garma gai he
 Arvind Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi have made the election quite interesting
 pehle bahes na karne par bahes hui or ab aaropon kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Aam Aadmi Party has accused Kiran Bedi that she was an informer of BJP from the very beginning, right from the time of Anna's movement
 un par yah aarope he ki kejariwal jab agast, 2012 main koyala aavanton ghotaale main manmohan singh, sonia gandhi or nitin gadakari ke gharon kaa gheraav kii yojana bana rahi thi, tab kiran bedi ne gadakari ke ghar kaa gheraav na karne kaa suzav diya tha
 It is said that since then differences started between Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi
 ab kiran bedi kaa kahana he ki yadi aisa tha to, kejariwal ne mujhe aam aadmi party kii ore se mukhyamantri ummidavaar banane kaa prastaav kyon diya tha
 Kiran says Kejriwal is a leader of 'dangerous' and 'negative' thinking
 vahiin, aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki yadi aap (kiran bedi) ghar vaapasi, lav jehad, ladakiyon ke dress code tay karne or kaale dhan ke rup main chanda lene vaali party kaa siem candidet banati hai, to aapke bare main kya raay banaai jaae
 
 
 In fact, when Kiran Bedi joined BJP and the manner in which BJP national president Amit Shah as well as Arun Jaitley attended that press conference and then came to Aam Aadmi Party's Shazia Ilmi, the atmosphere felt in favor of BJP Is becoming magar jab krishna nagar main kiran bedi pehali baar pahunchin, to kaaryakartaaon main utana utsaah nahin dikhaa
 In fact, the bjp's problem was that they did not have a face in comparison to Kejriwal and Kejriwal wanted to make the Delhi riots versus Kejriwal
 aise main bijepi ne sochaa ki ladaai ke moharon ko badal diya jaae
 BJP is not a united party in Delhi
 yah kai guton se milakar bani party thi
 Now, by making an outsider the CM candidate, the BJP has angered all these groups and all these groups have now united to sink Bedi's loot
 bijepi ne isko dekhte hue ek badi gheraabandi kii taiyaari kii he
 For 70 seats, 70 mps and party president Amit Shah himself took charge
 yadi ek netaa kaa kahana maane, to bijepi ne itane bade str par databes taiyaar kiya he, jisamen harek voter kaa naam, uski jati, yadi vah dilli se baahar kaa he, to uske gaanv or jila kaa naam tak shaamil he
 If you are from a district of Bihar, then the leader of your caste will call you to vote for BJP
 aap bhi sochegein ki ek vot he, daal hi dete hai, jila ke netaa ji kaa phone aayaa tha
 
 
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party is confident of its traditional vote and Kejriwal's charisma
 use lag rahaa he ki voter unhen ek mauka jarur degaa
 This is the reason why Kejriwal is assuring people of not leaving the government again
 kejariwal or kiran bedi donon ke saath dikkat he ki donon fitrat se netaa nahin hai
 Kejriwal has learned a little, but Kiran Bedi is yet to learn a lot
 abhi sangh ko bhi yah tay karnaa he ki vah kiran bedi ke liye kitni takat jhonkega or pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bhi maidan main utarana baaki he
 In the coming days, the picture will be clear only when the electoral turmoil will increase, but in the initial phase the BJP is looking a little nervous

 If you use Facebook, then your data is with Facebook
 agar aap fasebuk yuj nahin karte hai or internet yujar hai to mumkin he aapkaa data bhi fasebuk ke paas hoga
 This may sound a bit odd, but it is true
 fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg ne khud yah baat maani he
 In the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared on the second day for questions from members of the US Congress
 is dauraan kai tikhe sawaal puche gaye jinamein se ek sawaal ye tha ki kya fasebuk un yugers kaa bhi data colect karata he jinka acount fasebuk par he hi nahin
 In response to this question, Mark Zuckerberg first became silent and then he answered no
 congress ke ek member ne yah sawaal poocha, ‘yah mana gaya he ki aap non fasebuk yugers kaa bhi data colect karte hai
 So in such a situation, a user who does not have a Facebook account, can do something that does not leave his data on Facebook? In response to this question, Mark Zuckerberg said, 'any user can control the data given for advertising
 Can and if you can opt out, whether it uses our service or not, but to save people from tracking the user's public information, then we need to know this Whenever someone is constantly trying to access our service, read 'jakarberg answered these questions in front of Congress on the second day, and while continuing the simple silence on them, Congress member Lujan further asked Mark Zuckerberg,' You Everyone can control their data, but you are also collecting data for users who are not on Facebook, mark jakarberg ne non fasebuk yujar data colect karne ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘ham suraksha kaarnon se un yugers kaa bhi data colect karte hai jinhone fasebuk ke liye sin ap nahin kiya he’ itnaa hi nahin, mark jackberg ne yaha tak jawaab main kaha he ki fasebuk yugers kii kuch jaankariyaan tab bhi trek karata he jab unhone fasebuk acount log of kar rahaa he
 However, their reasoning behind this is that the purpose of doing this is to know which user is doing this to get information of a user to access the service again and again
 fasebuk par acount nahin he to kaise fasebuk aapkaa data colect kar saktaa he?jaahir he yah sawaal aapke man main aayaa hoga ki jab aapane fasebuk par acount hi nahin banaaya to kaise wo aapkaa data colect kar rahaa he
 Let me tell you a simple answer
 aap internet yujar hai to din bhar main kai tarah kii websitekholte honge, zyaadaatar website main aap fasebuk kaa like or share batan dekhte honge, agar aapane use clic kiya to samaj lijie fasebuk aapkaa data colect kar rahaa he
 The surprising thing is that even if you have not clicked the Facebook Like and Share button and it is present only on a third party website, your data is still being shared with Facebook
 agar aapkaa acount fasebuk par nahin he or aap kisi kii profile search karne fasebuk par aae hai to aisi sthiti main bhi fasebuk aapke bihaviour ko note karata he or data colect karata he
 However, Mark Zuckerberg could not tell what kind of data Facebook non-users store on Facebook
 congressvuman castor ne poocha, ‘aap medical data colect karte hai un logon kaa bhi jo fasebuk yujar hai yaa nahin hai wo internet yuj karte hai’mark jakarberg ne iske jawaab main kaha, ‘congressvuman haa, ham kuch data colect karte hai’
 After this, he asked that if you collect data and claim that it is for security then there is no way to turn it off? Zuckerberg said, 'for obvious reasons we do not allow people to turn security security off' when Mark Zuckerberg was asked if you can tell how many non-facebook users have your data
 iske jawaab main fasebuk ke siio ne kaha ki abhi is vakt unke dimag main iskaa jawaab nahin he, lekin baad main iskaa jawaab diya ja saktaa he

 saath hi party ke sabhi kendriya mantri, saansad, vidhayak milakar kul 4000 bijepi netaa apane-apane rajyon main 25 mashhoor hastiyon se mulaakaat karne vaale hai
 In the campaign, BJP has set a target of meeting one lakh people

 In this episode, Amit Shah has met former Army Chief Dalbir Singh Suhag, former Lok Sabha Secretary General and Lawyer Subhash Kashyap, former cricketers Kapil Dev, Yogguru Baba Ram Dev and Justice Lahoti
 aksar aisa nahin hota ki lalu prasad yadav hairaan-pareshaan ho jaaen
 But one such occasion came in July this year when a group of reporters questioned the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president about the plans and political future of his two sons just before the assembly elections
 lalu ne palatakar sawaal kiya, “mere bete agar chunaav nahin ladenge to karenge kya? kya bhens charaaenge?” in sawaalon kaa asal “jawaab” agle din patna main mila, jab bijepi ke ek aalaa netaa ne chutki lete hue kaha, “nahin, unhen chunaav ladgaye dijie
 Party workers are few to feed cattle anyway
 ”koi or chunaav hota to bhagava khemaa is shandaar hazirajvaabi ko fouran lapak letaa or maujuun chunavi naare main badal detaa, jo shaayad kuch is tarah hota, “apane beton ko chunaav ladvaaiye or argedy kaaryakartaaon se bhens charavaaie
 "but the BJP leader allowed this thing to remain in the darkness of oblivion because this time the BJP is going into an election in which dynasty is no longer the legacy of any one or two parties
 aise rajya main jahaan siyasat pehle mukhyamantri shri krishna singh ke jamaane se hi paariwarik kaarobaar bani hui he, bijepi abhi tak apane aap ko “dusron se alag” party jataati ai he
 Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been mocking the UPA constantly by calling it "mother-son government"

 Thakur has secured the assembly election ticket for his sons

 Chaubey himself has represented this seat in the assembly several times before contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Buxar in 2014
 sutron kaa daawa he ki choube asal main apane duusare bete aviral shaashvat ke liye bhi baxur se tikat chaahate the
 He was refused
 chabe haalanki in aaropon kaa khandan karte hai, “maine apane bete ke liye tikat nahin maanga
 The party leadership decided to give him a ticket in view of his contribution
 ”thakur ke bete vivek brahampur seat se ummidavaar hai
 Vivek was earlier given a place in the Legislative Council, which was seen as an attempt to convince his father, as he resigned from the post of state BJP president, expressing his dissatisfaction just before the 2010 elections
 bijepi ne patna kii digha seat se varisht party netaa ganga prasad ke bete sanjeev chaurasia ko maidan main utaara he
 However, these attempts to crown the heirs have not reacted well everywhere

 Thakur and Ashwini Choubey came with Arijit to file nomination papers, then Vijay Kumar Sahi, rebel from Bhagalpur Mahanagar Party President, also filed his nomination on the same day and thousands of party workers who went with him also demonstrated parallel power
 abhi tak keval sasaram ke saansad chhedi paswan ne is “bhedbhaav” par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 He made the charge when his son Ravi was denied a party ticket
 ravi ne ab samaajawaadee party kaa daaman tham liya he or unhen chenari se endie ke adhikrut ummidavaar ke khilaaf chunaav ladvaya jayega
 Paswan said on 27 September, "when Ashwini Choubey and c

 If the party did not see any wrong in giving tickets to Thakur's sons, then i do not understand why my son was denied the ticket
 ”tabhi se paswan pahunch se baahar hai or unke phone par jawaab dene vaale shaks ne india today se kaha ki ve media se baat karnaa nahin chaahate
 Similarly, on September 29, Chaubey did not get any response even after repeated calls
 vipaksh ke netaa nand kishor yadav ne india today se kaha ki bijepi vanshavaad kii siyasat nahin karti
 He said, “we have given tickets to party workers and not because they are the sons of our leaders
 kuch netaaon ne bilkul isi baat kii shikaayat kii he, isse sabit hota he ki hamane pariwarik rishton kii vajah se tikat nahin die hai
 The two NDA coalition partners, Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Jeetanram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam morcha-secular (HAM-S), are not far behind in giving tickets to the heirs, but are one step ahead

 However, LJP family politics is seen in open display

 The party has given ticket to Yusuf, son of Khagadia MP Mahbub Ali Kaiser from Simri Bakhtiyarpur and Kanhaiya Singh, brother of MP Surajbhan Singh, from Mokama

 But what is of concern in this state of Bihar, which gives first importance to the family, is the silence of the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the leaders like Sushil Modi, who was his Deputy Chief Minister for a long time
 donon bihar ke ikkaa-dukka shikhar netaaon main se hai, jinhone apane parivaar ke sadasyon ko raajnneeti main nahin aane diya he
 Nitish is also perhaps the lone leader of the state, who declared a war against family politics

 The accusation of rape on a religious leader is shocking in itself
 lekin agar koi dharmaguru balaatkaar se bhi aage badhkar apane hi bhakton ke saath group sex, yani samuhik sex karne lage, to ise aap kya kahenge? asaram ke bete narayan sai par jo nayaa ilzaam laga he, wo kuch aisa hi he
 This charge is no longer just a charge, but an important part of the document presented in the court
 aasthaa kii roshni main ankhen kab kii chaundhiya chuki thim, jeeta-jaagta insaan kab kaa bhagwaan ban chukaa tha
 But when the map of hypocrisy started coming out of the face of this god, the watchers just kept looking
 bhagwaan kaa rup dharkar paap kaa mayajaal bunane vaale baap-bete asaram or narayan sai par balaatkaar or yon shoshan kaa ilzaam to kab ke lag chuke the
 But now the new charge that has been leveled against Narayan Sai, no one can make a strange and shocking charge
 ji haa, narayan sai par ilzaam he group sex kaa
 Group sex, that is, collective sex
 duusare lafzon main kahen, to do se adhik kii taadaad main ek hi vaqt par jismani tallukaat kaayam karne kaa
 No one has accused Narayan Sai about this on the go, but by a government lawyer from Surat in a full court
 surat ke sarkari vakil ne narayan sai ke hi ek puraane sadhak ke hawaale se adaalat ko bataaya he ki narayan sai ek hi vakt main ek saath 9-10 ladakiyon ke saath sex karata tha
 Narayan Sai was seen doing so by his own seeker, who later revealed this in a statement before the magistrate
 sarkari vakil ne siarpisi kii dhara 164 ke tahat record karwaae gaye is bayaan kaa zikr karte hue adaalat main maujuud harek shaks ko chaunkaa diya
 In his statement, this seeker has told that he saw 9-10 girls going to Narayan Sai's room together under mysterious circumstances at the same time
 anushthan ke naam par band kamare main hue is khel ke baad jab kamare kii safaai kii gai, to vahaan dheron bear kii bolten nikaleen
 He saw all this with his own eyes not once, but many times
 is sadhak kii baton kaa yakeen karen, to narayan sai bear or group sex kaa jabardast shaukeen he or aksar nae-nae bahaanon se group sex kaa mauka talashta rahata he
 But this was just the beginning of the new charges on Narayan Sai
 surat police ko apni tafteesh main ye bhi pataa chalaa ki narayan sai ne kai aisi shaadishuda auraton ko apane jaal main fansane ke liye unke patiyon ko hi dhokhe se dawaaen khilaakar unhen napusank bana diya
 When such a woman would come to Narayan Sai for Aulad or attend a satsang, she would be given those herbs in the name of giving strength medicine to her husband, which could lead to impotence
 is tarah jab narayan sai apane iraade main kaamyaab ho jaataa, to phir anushthan or samarpan ke naam par aisi mahilaon kaa bhi yon shoshan karata

 During the by-elections in Chitrakoot seat in November 2017, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had said, "now there will be bandits in Chitrakoot or Shivraj! They will be chased out of Chitrakoot in the same way as the dacoits were chased out of Chambal
 ''lekin 24 oktober kii hathiyaarband dakaiton ne van vibhaag ke ek purv esadio or ritred clerk samet gaadi chalaa rahe driver ko bandhak bana liya
 The dacoits have abducted the driver along with retired SDO Ramashray Pandey (rewa), retired clerk of the forest department, Suresh Sohgaura

 This Lovelace Cole is the one who was believed to be the right hand man of Durdant dacoit Babli Koli
 lekin pichley saal donon ke bich jhagada ho gaya or ek kii jagah ab do gang ban gaye
 Raja Bhaiya of Manikpur in Chitrakoot says, "earlier there was fear of the same gang, but now nobody knows when Babli and when Lovelesh will attack
 ''ve kehete hai, manikar poor chitrakoot ke chor par padataa he
 Neither the police nor any officer comes here

 Soon the dacoits will be in our clutches
 lekin sach to yah he ki abhi tak police ke haath koi suraag nahin laga he
 On the other hand, local people say that when Shivraj Singh Chauhan made a noise a year ago, the people living in the areas adjacent to Chitrakoot of UP and MP breathed a sigh of relief
 darasal daakuon ke liye mashhoor chambal to daaku mukt ho gaya lekin ye ilaaka aaj bhi daakuon ke liye ke liye behad surakshit thikaana bana hui he
 In such a situation, people thought that Shivraj would really get rid of the dacoits from here, like Chambal
 lekin shivaraj vaada karke bhul gaye
 Some people are also saying that the situation of BJP in Madhya Pradesh is not good this time
 kahin aisa na ho ki daaku bache rahen or shivaraj kaa vidaai ho jaae
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who was excited in the Chitrakoot by-election, had openly challenged the dacoits, but even after one election, the dacoits are active there

 mumbai or maharashtra main bhikhaariyon kaa diene test hoga
 The Ministry of Women and Child Development has sent a proposal to this effect to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 mumbai me har saal amuman 2 hajaar bachche chori yaa laapata hote hai or desh main ye sankhya lakhon main he
 It is suspected that the stolen children are used for begging
 maharashtra kii mahila va bal vikaas mantralay kii rajya mantri vidya thakur ke mutabik wo aksar dekha karti thi ki trephic signlon par mahilaayein chote bachche ko gond main lekar bheekh maangati hai
 The child lying on his lap neither cries nor plays, he only sleeps as if he was given some medicine
 vidya thakur bataati hai ki ek baar signal par aisi hi ek mahila se unhone jab poocha baccha kiskaa he to usne apana bataaya
 But when he took out the mobile and started making videos with the camera, he ran away
 tabhi se unke man main tha ki is par kuch karnaa chaiye
 Therefore, now that she has become the Minister of State for Women and Child Welfare, a proposal has been prepared for DNA testing of all such beggars
 vidya thakur ke mutabik is vishay ko lekar wo mumbai police ayukta se bhi mil chuki hai
 The minister claims that beggars who claim to have young children and their mothers will be benefited by double testing
 agar unka diene aapas main nahin mila to ye saaf ho jaayegaa ki baccha uskaa nahin he
 After that the picture of that child will be put on the website so that they can identify themselves
 mumbai police ke mutabik shahar main saal 2005 se 2014 tak 34787 chote bachche laapata yaa chori hue hai
 It is a different matter that 33383 of them have been brought back
 lekin 1404 bachche ab bhi laapata hai
 According to organizations that work for beggars and homeless children, beggars come from certain communities and have distributed different traffic signals for themselves
 zyada kamai vaale signlon kii boli bhi lagati he
 The comments chield line ke pravaktaa nishit kumaar diene test karaane ko ek acchhee pahal to maanate hai lekin unka kahana he ki ye fori ilaaj he
 While the need is a long-term remedy
 isaliye unka suzav he ki bachche ke janm ke baad hi aadhaar card main uske diene se lekar sari jaankaree darj kii jaye to chori yaa laapata hone kii surat main bacchon ko trek karnaa aasaan ho jaayegaa
 Which is not possible right now
 nishit kumaar ke mutabik sabase badi samasya inke punarvaas kii he, puure rajya main sirf ek hi punarvaas kendra he wo bhi kolhapur main jabaki bheekh maangane waalon kii taadaad hazaron main he or puure rajya main faile hai
 According to Vidya Thakur, Minister of State in the Ministry of Women and Child Development of Maharashtra, she often used to see women begging a small child in glue at traffic signals
 unki god main padaa baccha naa to rota he naa hi kheltaa he, wo sirf soya rahata he jaise use koi dawaai di gai ho
 Vidya Thakur tells that once she asked one such woman on the signal, whose child is she told her
 lekin jab unhone mobile nikaalkar camere se video bananaa shuru kiya to wo bhaag khadil hui
 Since then, he had in mind that something should be done on this
 isaliye ab jab wo mahila vaa bal kalyaan rajya mantri ban gai hai to aise sabhi bhikhaariyon kaa diene test karaane kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya he
 According to Vidya Thakur, she has also met the Mumbai Police Commissioner regarding this subject
 mantri mahodaya kaa daawa he ki chote bachche or unki maa hone kaa daawa karne vaali bhikhaaran kaa diene test karaane se doharaa phayda hoga
 If their DNA is not found among themselves, it will become clear that the child does not belong to them
 uske baad us bachche kii tasviir websit par daali jaayegi taaki uske apane uski pahchaan kar saken
 According to Mumbai Police, 34787 young children have gone missing or stolen in the city from 2005 to 2014
 ye alag baat he ki unamem se 33383 bachche waapas bhi mil gaye hai
 But 1404 children are still missing
 bhikhaari or beghar bacchon ke liye kaam karne vaali sansthaaon ke mutabik bhikh maangane vaale kuch khaas samudaay se aate hai or unhone apane liye alag-alag trephic signal baant liya he
 High earning signals are also bid
 tippaniyan Childline spokesperson Nishit Kumar considers DNA testing to be a good initiative but says that it is an immediate cure
 jabaki zarurat ek dirghakaalik upaay kii he
 That is why they suggest that after the birth of the child, if all the information from his DNA is recorded in the Aadhaar card, then it will be easier to track the children in case of theft or disappearance
 jo abhi sambhav nahin he
 According to Nishit Kumar, the biggest problem is the rehabilitation of them, there is only one rehabilitation center in the entire state, that too in Kolhapur while the number of beggars are in thousands and are spread all over the state
 vidya thakur bataati hai ki ek baar signal par aisi hi ek mahila se unhone jab poocha baccha kiskaa he to usne apana bataaya
 But when he took out the mobile and started making videos with the camera, he ran away

 NCP is putting the ball in the Congress court
 vahiin, congress kisi bhi faisle par pahunchane se pehle kisi tarah kii jaldbaaji main nahin dikh rahi
 In the midst of all these political developments, Sharad Pawar has denied reports of the Congress calling him to Delhi for a meeting on Tuesday
 unhone media se kaha mujhe nahin pataa kii yah khabar kahaan se aa rahi he lekin main bas itnaa kahana chahta hum ki mujhe aisi koi soochna nahin he

 It goes on to say that Shiv Sena had sought 48 hours from the Governor expressing his desire to form the government, but the Governor did not give time
 jiske baad rajyapal ne rajya main teesri sabase badi party NCP se sarkaar banane ke bare main poocha he or use mangalvaar raat 8:30 baje tak kaa samay diya he
 The NCP will hold a meeting with its mlas at 11 am
 baithak ke liye sharad pavaar or supriya sule ek saath nikle, jabaki ajit pavaar duusari gaadi se nikle
 Before going to the meeting, Ajit Pawar said, "congress call from Delhi was whether Sharad Pawar could come to Delhi today for the meeting
" hamane kaha ki aaj vidhayakon ke saath baithak he isliye sambhav nahin hoga
 But we have told the Congress leaders of Maharashtra that they come to Mumbai and we meet and make a common minimum program

 "asking that if Congress leaders are not coming today, then President's rule will be imposed?" So he said that it is not necessary to come here

 Ajit Pawar made it clear that he has contested the elections with the Congress and whatever decision is there is with him

 On the other hand, the Congress has not opened its cards yet with the support of Shiv Sena

 After all, Australia finished the ICC World Cup 2015 with a record fifth title
 newjiland ummid lagaae najar aa rahaa tha, jisase mere us anubhav kii yaaden taaja ho rahi thim, jab 2003 main main pehali baar vishwa cap ke final main utraa tha
 At that time we were playing very well, we had a great synergy and all the players were very enthusiastic for the final
 newjiland kii team bhi bahut had tak usee andaaj main najar aa rahi thi, lekin ant main ladkadaa gai
 The final map was cleared in the first over on both occasions
 hamane apane pehle over main bahut zyada ran de die the, jabaki newjiland ne apane captain brendan makkulam kaa wicket kho diya tha
 New Zealand could never hold on to a pace that lasted the entire innings, losing wickets quickly and failing to produce a challenging score
 makkulam ke out hone ke baad mujhe laga ki martin guptil or ken williamson ne gendbaaji ko apane upar haaavee hone ko jaisi apni sahmati de di he
 He became more vigilant and did not change the ends as fast as he should have changed
 grant iliyat or ross tailor ke bich ek acchhee-khaasi saajhedaari hui thi, lekin tailor kaa wicket girane ke baad sthitiyaan newjiland ke paksh main nahin rah gai thim
 It was a round of day and night games in which shadows hit the pitch and watching the ball can be a challenge
 ek shandaar yorker par kori anderson kaa wicket jane or uske baad jald hi luk ronchi ke out hone ke baad ek sangharsh yogya aankada pesh karne kii unki ummiden samaapt ho gayi thim
 Of course, stopping the Australian team within 183 is nothing short of a miracle
 lekin chamatkaar mushkil se hi hote hai
 In the end, Clarke and his team should be given full numbers to stop New Zealand's victory chariot and win the coveted trophy
 yah aisa vishwa cap tha, jo ek se adhik kaarnon se ballebaajon ke paksh main puri tarah jhukaa hua tha
 So it was great to see that the final was decided by decisive bowling rather than a batsman playing an extraordinary innings
 isi sandarbh main main yah bhi maanata hum ki pakistan-australia match main shen watasan ko wahaab riyaj kii gendbaaji is baar ke vishwa cap ke sabase yaadgaar palon main se ek rahegi
 Daniel Vettori and R
 asina jaise spinner apni chaturaai or kralite ke boote shreshth sabit hue, jabaki mishael stark, wahaab riyaj, trent bolt, del sten, mohammad shami, umesh yadav, mohit sharma, or kuch anya gendbaajon ne khel kaa anand liya or sthitiyon kaa laabh uthaaya
 There are several issues that i have raised in the last few weeks: whether it was the case of two white balls that would have eliminated the question of reverse swing, or the lack of a fielder, which made the situation more difficult for bowlers
 Used to give, especially in the last overs
 or adhik spasht muddon main se ek tha elbeadblu ke liye refral pranali, jise maine asangat or virodhabhasi paaya he
 When a decision is made by the bowler to reconsider, who is confident that the ball is blowing the stump, and the technology also confirms it, then it is unfortunate that the umpire standing on the field will be considered only when the ball One part is just hitting the stump
 duusari ore, agar kisi ballebaaj ko ampire ne out qaraar diya he, or vah nirnay par punarvichaar kii apil karata he or phir ek baar technology bataati he ki gend kaa ek hissaa stump se takaraa rahaa he, to ballebaaj ko out maan liya jaataa he, kyonki yah ampire kaa mul nirnay tha
 This contradiction negates the use of third umpire and technology
 uski koi ahmiyat nahin rah jaati
 This rule can be especially harsh when the player is comfortable about the movement of the ball
 truti ke margin ke kaaran na sirf nirnay uske khilaaf jaataa he, balki team bhi ek nirnaayak refral kho detii he
 i understand that the technology is still not 100 percent accurate, but the same technology is for everyone, so the rules could possibly have been more consistent
 niyam to ek samaan hona chahie, jo field ampire se swatantra ho, jisamen agar aadhi se kam gend stump se takaraati he, to ballebaaj ko note out (yaa out) samajha janaa chahie, chaahe mul nirnay kuch bhi rahaa ho
 Or, if the umpire's decision on the field is final and technology is showing that the ball is hitting the stump, a referral from the reviewing team should not end
 vastav main hamen technology kii simaaon ke kaaran adhik jatil niyam banane kii bajaae technology ko behatar banane kii disha main sochna chahie
 Only then will we be able to make relevant and useful rules for the game
 ham ek aise daur main hai jisamen hamaare pradarshan par media kii lagaataar paini najar bani rahati he, lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki isse kisi ko bhadakaane yaa vyaktigat hamale karne kaa adhikaar mil jaataa he
 i was deeply disappointed by the manner in which some irresponsible media institutions shouted at our Indian team on the basis of a bad day on the field
 puure vishwa cap ke dauraan maidan par hamaari team ke shandaar or lagaataar pradarshan ko apni suvidha ke hisaab se bhula diya gaya tha
 i can assure the readers that based on the current team India has played with most of the players, they have no lack of commitment or dedication and no player can enter the semi-finals without the belief that To play in the biggest match of world cricket
 pradarshan se pare bhi is toornament main maidan par kuch yaadgaar kshan dekhne ko mili
 Afghanistan expressed its joy after registering their first win, watching Grant Elliott picking up the depressed Dale Steyn after the loss, playing Zimbabwe's Brendan Taylor on his last innings and giving a warm farewell to the Indian team's players, and Brendon mccullum, on the verge of defeat, hands over Michael Clarke, showing that the spirit of the game is still alive today
 isisi vishwa cap 2015 ke saath kai shandaar vyaktiyon ke ekadivasiy antarrashtriya kariyar kaa bhi samaapan ho gaya
 While Clarke has found a very suitable farewell, my heart is with Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Shahid Afridi, misbah-ul-haq, Kyle Mills, Brendan Taylor and Daniel Vettori
 in sabhi ne lambey samay tak khel kii seva kii he or prashansakon ke man main khud ke liye ek vishisht jagah paidaa kii he
 The tournament is a very different kind of semi-final between New Zealand and South Africa
 isamen ek aise match ke sabhi tatv the, jisaki laalasaa sabhi darshakon ko hoti he, jisaki ummid khilaadi karte hai, or itihaas jiskaa intjaar karata he
 The patience and stamina displayed by both sides until the end of the last over was absolutely top-notch, and watching New Zealand win by defeating one of the world's leading fast bowlers is a script that the other No one can write ddeergha se ek darshak ke taur par maine apane pehle vishwa cap kaa anand liya he
 It was a pleasure for me to be one of the millions who clapped for the Indian team till the end, and this time i will continue to support them, stay with them even during this difficult period of recovery
 jaisaa ki main aaj bhi kahata hum, haar ho yaa jeet, aapako adbhut utaar-chadhaavon ke liye is khel kaa anand lenaa chahie
 Uncertainty and ups and downs are the real fun of this game
 agar aap parinaam se itar chizon kaa anand nahin le paa rahe hai, to aapke liye kuch or karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 i congratulate all the "winners" of this tournament, because if you have fun on the field yourself, it has won the game
 khel kaa anand lene kii kshamta vah ekmaatr pahalu he, jo aapako khelte rahane detii he
 So, until the next World Cup comes, it should be enjoyed more by not paying attention to the results
 sunwaayee ke liye court gaye aadmi ko giraftaar bataakar, modi aaratiyaan-chalisaayen likhane vaale patrakaron ko ek baar ragadrabari zarur pard lenaa chahie

 Sibal said that his recent statement in a blog is a late reaction before the Lok Sabha elections
 sibbal ne apni website par likhaa he, 'modi par dangon kaa boj bana rahegaa
 He was too late to reveal that it had shaken him up
 agar vaisaa hua hota to unke hriday ne samay par pratikriya vyakt kii hoti
 There would not have been a late response just before the Lok Sabha elections
 ' The Union Minister said that 'grief and grief' in Modi's blog was for a listener whose sympathy will be important in May 2014
 unhone kaha ki dard hriday ko chhu jane vaala, swat: or aisi bhaavana hoti he jise bina jod-ghataav ke jaahir kiya jaataa he
 He said, 'pain can never be a late reaction after 11 years of silence
 or ek vyakti jo maun main ksht jhelta he vah 11 saal tak maun nahin rah saktaa
 i do not want to be selfish in my comments, i cannot be dishonest
 mukti kaa yah krity hamen asli modi se nahin jodta he
 ' sibbal gujarat ke mukhyamantri kii ore se likhe gaye ek blog post par pratikriya vyakt kar rahe the jisamen unhone kaha ki vah 2002 ke danga maamalon main sthaneey adaalat dwaara clinit die jane se vah 'mukt or shanti mahasoos' kar rahe hai
 He claimed that he was 'broken' by the blame for the killings
 modi is mudde par ek dashak se adhik samay tak media kii poochtacha se bachate rahe or dangon ke liye kabhi maafee nahin maangi
 He said in his blog that he was shaken by the riots from within
 modi ke blog kaa ullekh karte hue sibbal ne aashcharya jataayaa ki kis bhai or bahan kaa gujarat ke mukhyamantri ullekh kar rahe the jab vah apane nijee dard ke bare main baat kar rahe the
 Sibal said that those who lost their brothers and sisters needed ointment and that too soon after the riots
 sibbal ne kaha, '11 saal kaaphi der he
 In his article in response to Modi's blog, Sibal said that attention should be paid to the dreaded ordeal of the victims and not to Modi's ordeal
 dharmagranth kaa gyaan modi ko 2002 main hona chahie tha, na ki 2013 main
 Sibal said, 'those who plan in seclusion never feel pain in solitude
 newton ke gati ke niyam main vishwaas karne vaale log pratikriya vyakt karne ke liye 11 saal ke liye intjaar nahin karte
 ' sibbal ne kai sawaal puche
 He asked where the 'pain' was when the Gujarat government defended those who have now been convicted
 sibbal ne poocha, 'dard tab kahaan tha jab unki (doshiyon kii) begunaahi ke bare main adaalaton main halafanama daayar kiya gaya tha
 Where was the pain when lawyers were paid to defend the indefensible
 dard tab kahaan tha jab rajya un logon kii madad karne ke liye nahin aayaa jo madad ke liye karaah rahe the
 Where was the pain when people were demanding justice but were left in the cold
 dard tab kahaan tha jab aropiyon ke khilaaf adaalat main mukadmaa chalaaya ja rahaa tha to rajya unke halafname ko tay karne ke liye unke saath milakar kaam kar rahaa tha
 ' ashok choudhary, bhaajapa ke kota (rajasthan) jile ke obisi cell ke pramukh hai
 He wrote a letter to the party's national president Amit Shah on 3 February
 isamen kaha gaya ki rajya main sarkaar or sanghathan ke str par jald badlaav is saal hone vaale vidhansabha or phir agle saal ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ke liye jaruri he
 No reply to this letter has come from the national president yet, but many leaders of the state and the center do not consider Chaudhary's concern wrong
 lihaaja, party main parivartan kaa maanas ban rahaa he
 For the BJP, Rajasthan-like concern is also from the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh
 lekin vahaan mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke liye fori raahat is baat se he ki kaaryakartaaon main parivartan kii jo chahat he, uski aanch abhi sirf sanghathan tak he
 The government is currently out of its control
 alvar tathaa ajmer loksabhaa or mandalgarh vidhansabha up-chunaav main bhaajapa jis bade antar se chunaav haari, usne party alaakaman ke liye netritv parivartan ke vikalp par bhi chintan kaa rasta khol diya
 Sources say that the reason for the defeat, the state president Ashok Parnami, argued to Amit Shah of the small management lapse in the management, he rejected it saying that "with such a big difference from the management's lapse There is no defeat, it is a sample of resentment against the government
 ''haalanki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne alaakaman se kaha he ki upachunaavon main haar ke liye akele unhen hi doshi nahin mana ja saktaa
 However, by this assessment, Shah indicated the possibility of change to the state government and the organization
 pichley saptaah shah or rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke bich do baar lambii baatcheet ho chuki he
 It is said that the issue of change of leadership also arose in their conversation
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki raaje pradesh str par sanghathan main pherbadal ko lekar taiyaar hai lekin ve chaahati hai ki paranami kii jagah kisi aise vyakti ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya jaae jo unke (vasundhara) saath talmail bitha sake
 Also, the state president should not be the one who activists see as an alternative to the chief minister
 haalanki kendriya netritv ne is babat raaje ko koi aashwaasan nahin diya, sirf unki baat suni lekin aalaa netritv kisi bhi parivartan ke liye raji nahin hone vaali raaje ko kaaphi had tak raji karne main (parivartan ke liye) kaamyaab rahaa
 a senior party leader who interferes with the Rajasthan BJP says that there have been many suggestions from the state about the change of leadership
 inamen do upmukhyamantri banane, pradesh adhyaksh ke liye kisi rajput chehre ko saamne laane jaise suzav bhi die gaye
 Meanwhile, in the political equation formed by the Dalit movement, there was a suggestion that a Dalit should be given the leadership in place of Vasundhara
 sutron kaa kahana he ki isaki sambhawana bahut kam lagati he, haalanki bhaajapa ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai ki is andolan ne rajasthan or madhya pradesh, donon rajyon main sheeghra parivartan ko or pakkaa kar diya he
 In both states, there was a strong protest of Dalit protests on 2 April
 aise main in rajyon main sanghathan or sarkaar main dalit samudaay ke logon ko shaamil kar party apni us baat ko pakkaa kar sakati he ki bhaajapa daliton ke saath he
 People close to the BJP high command say that the party generally avoids a change of leadership 6-8 months before the elections, but this time Rajasthan is different from other BJP ruled states
 chunki madhya pradesh, gujarat yaa chhattisgarh main pichley kai chunaavon se bhaajapa satta main bani hui he isliye in rajyon main chunaav se mahaj kuch maheene pehle sarkaar main parivartan kii koi thos vajah nahin he
 This is not the case in Rajasthan
 vahaan har paanch saal main sarkaar badalati rahi he
 Along with this voting pattern from the public, in addition to the defeat in the recent by-election, there is also a sense of dissatisfaction among the workers
 pradesh adhyaksh or kuch mantriyon kaa parivartan ek vikalp he kyonki rajya main raaje kii jagah koi shashakt netaa nahin he or chunavi varsh main raaje ke virodh main khadey hone se party ko zyada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav agrees that some issues have been reported by the activists but he says, "these will be overcome
" ''parivartan ke asaar rajasthan ke padosi rajya madhya pradesh main bhi hai
 Preparations for change at the organization level have been completed
 pradesh se jo feed back mil rahaa he, unamem sarkaar ko lekar shikaayatein to hai lekin naaraazgi nahin
 The resentment is definitely at the level of the organization
 chunki pradesh adhyaksh nandkumar chouhan, shivaraj ke kareebi maane jate hai isliye yah dharna bani hui he ki kaaryakartaaon kii shikayaton ko lekar ve (nandkumar) taalu ravaiya apanaate hai
 In such a situation, the top leadership would like that a strong leader like Shivraj be deployed in the organization
 iske liye kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars kaa naam charchaa main he
 But Tomar says, "there is no discussion about leadership change in the state organization
 ''haalanki, bhaajapa ke kai netaa khule taur par tomars kii kaabiliyat ko lekar bolne se hichakate nahin
 BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya remains silent on the change of leadership but he says, "under the leadership of Shivraj and Tomar, the BJP has done well in Madhya Pradesh
" '' iske maddenjar alaakaman ek baar phir is jodi ko aajamaa saktaa he
 The preparations for change in these two major states are connected with BJP President Shah's Mission 2019, just a few months before the elections
 sutron kaa kahana he ki rajasthan bachaane or madhya pradesh main badi jeet kii koshish main koi bhi faisla shah-modi kii jodi legi
 In the Lok Sabha elections, if only two states got out of hand four to five months ago, then for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party will not get the edge it needs
 in donon rajyon ko ganvaane kaa matlab he congress ko sanjivani milanaa, kyonki in donon hi rajyon main bhaajapa kaa sidhaa muqabla congress se hi he
 Conversely, if the BJP wins in these two states, then for 2019 the party workers can be given the message that the BJP is invincible under the leadership of Modi and Shah
 aise main bhaajapa kaa congress mukt bharat kaa naaraa party kaaryakartaaon main josh bharne ke kaam aayega

 jis tarah se congress ke ghoshnaa patr main deshadroh kanoon khatm karne, sena or surakshabalon ke visheshadhikaar ko kam karne ke vaade kiye gaye hai, usase rahul gandhi kii team par wo sawaal uth gaye hai, jo unhen pareshaan kar sakate hai, nai musiibat main daal sakate hai
 In order to cut the election agenda of nationalism and national security, Rahul Gandhi brought back the slogan of Poverty Hatao and in which he talked about guaranteeing an income guarantee of 72 thousand rupees annually, now Rahul is on the backfoot
 jin par he bavaal unheen ko congress ne chuaa!lekin in vaadon ke bich congress kaa puraa ghoshnaptr jab saamne aayaa, to usamen kuch un muddon kaa zikr bhi dekha gaya jo mudde kaaphi vivaadit rahe hai
 And over the years, there has been much discussion, debate and political confrontation
 jaise deshadroh ke kanoon kaa maamla, jis par jeenyu main deshvirohi naaron par karrwai ke baad bahut hangaamaa ho chukaa he or sena ke visheshadhikaar kaa maamla jo kashmir main aatank ke khilaaf jang main bahut zaruri bataaya jaataa he
 Both these issues are mentioned in promise number 30 of page number 34 of the Congress manifesto
 hamalavar hui bhajpakya congress ne apane ghoshnaptr main khud ke liye hi chunavi barood feet kar liya, ye sawaal isliye kyonki ghoshnaptr ke vaada number 30 main jo baaten kahi gai hai usko lekar bijepi ne chunavi top nikaalane main der nahin lagaai
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that this manifesto has agendas that work to break the country, go against the unity of the nation
 jo congress party vishesh rup se gandhi-nehru parivaar kii aitihaasik bhul thi, jammu-kashmir ke sambandh main jiske liye desh kabhi maaf nahin kar saktaa, us agenda ko or aage khatarnaak tareeke se aage badhaane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 It is also difficult for Rahul Gandhi that before the elections he was talking about setting a narrator through justice, but now the issue is stuck once again on nationalism
 kyonki rashtrawaad bijepi kii pich vaala aisa chunavi agenda he, jis par congress dur rahanaa hi chaahati thi or jiske liye usne 72 hazaar rupee or garibi hataao kaa slogan nikaala tha
 But what she knew was that, unknowingly, she would again get caught in the same things that she wanted to avoid

 Attacking the Congress, the BJP said that the stand of the opposition party has been exposed
 bijepi ne congress se aise netaaon kii pahchaan ujagar karne ko kaha he jinhone upie sarkaar ke dauraan ghotaale main shaamil logon ke naam hataane ke liye vinod raay se sampark kiya tha
 The BJP said that Vinod Rai's revelations confirmed his stand that the then UPA government was not only abusing constitutional institutions but was also putting pressure on it
 party pravaktaa vijay sonkar shastri ne kaha, ‘ham congress se chaahate hai ki vah un logon ke naam ujagar kare jo raay par dawaab daal rahe the

 vinod raay ne is bare main apni kitaab main byore die hai jo agle maheene aane vaali he
 On the other hand, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to Vinod Rai to reveal the names who were pressurizing him
 We urge Sh Vinod Rai to reveal the names of all those people who pressurised him to remove names
 Such people shud be punished — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) August 24, 2014 The Congress has accused Vinod Rai of sensationalizing things, taking a dig at Vinod Rai's statement

 pichley teen din se ganga kii safai ko lekar anshan kar rahe sant gopaldaas ji ames se laapata hai
 On Thursday, after hiding the information for two days, the Medical Supreme Court (MS) of AIIMS informed Gopaldas's father and his supporters along with Aam Aadmi Party leader Advocate Somnath Bharti
 lekin is jaankaree ne kai sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Is the central government really scared of the saints who are demanding the cleaning of the Ganges? Is Swami Nigamananda, Swami Gokulananda, Professor ji
 di
 After Agarwal (swami Sanand), was Saint Gopaldas sacrificed or sacrificed to clean the Ganges? In fact, Aam Aadmi Party leader Somanath Bharti was involved in AIIMS since the disappearance of Sant Gopaldas
 unki maang thi ki sant gopaldaas kahaan he, jaankaree di jaae?pehle to ames prashasan ne unhen nazarandaaj kiya
 But when Saint Gopaldas's father, Somnath Bharti and supporters stayed there, AIIMS MS had to open his mouth
 pataa chalaa ki unhen dehradun ke ek aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 But the reason for shifting from AIIMS to DOON was still not stated
 jab doon se pataa lagaaya gaya to santon kii hath se ghabaraai sarkaar kaa krur ravaiya saamne aayaa
 After a lot of brainstorming, local journalists came to know that he was admitted to a hospital here on 5 December 2018 as 'lavarish'
 unhen bhartee karne vaale log koun the, aakhir dilli ames se dehradun tak unhen koun laayaa? ye saare sawaalon ke jawaab dehradun ke us aspataal se nahin mil sake
 Around eight o'clock, the hospital informed the Dehradun police that Gopaldas had suddenly disappeared
 police ne bina is jaankaree ko saarvajanik kiye chupchaap unhen talash karne kii koshish kii
 But when he could not be found by the evening of December 6, some journalists informed the police
 koun the sant gopaldasgopaldaas haridwar sthit matrusadan ashram ke ek sant the
 He has been on hunger strike for the last 168 days
 is ashram se pehle bhi do sant ganga safai ko lekar bali chadh chuke hai
 Saint Nigamananda and Swami Gokulananda
 ganga ke liye anshan karte hue apni jaan dene vaale pro
 g d Agarwal or Swami Sanand was not a permanent part of Matrasadan
 lekin unka judaav is ashram se jarur tha
 Right now Atmabodhananda and Punyananda are fasting for the cleanliness of the Ganges
 in donon santon ko bhi anshan karte hue 48 din ho gaye hai
 Is there any indication of evil? Gurubhai Atmabodhanand ji of Sant Gopaldas said that he met the people of the ashram on October 24
 tab bhi unhone kaha tha “mere yahaan rahane se sarkaar ko takalif he
 Maybe they take me somewhere else
 unhone yah shankaa bhi jaahir kii thi ki ye log mujhe dhimaa jehar dekar matrusadan bhi chhod sakate hai, jisase main vahaan mar jaaun or sarkaar mere katl ke aarope se batch jaae
 But i will not go anywhere from here ''
 aatmbodhanand kehete hai,‘‘ sant gopaldaas ko pehle ames, rishikesh, phir joli grant, phir chandigarh or phir unhen ames, dilli le jaaya gaya
 The ashram was not even informed before being brought to the hospital in Dehradun
 unhen ek baar triveni ghat main bhi lavarish chhod diya gaya tha
 "atmabodhanananda is also on the lookout
 Atmabodhanandan's fast has also killed the administration
" unhen chaar din pehle hi ames, rishikesh main jabardastee le jaaya gaya tha
 There was an attempt to forcibly give them liquid food
 aatmbodhanand ne jaise-taise ashram ke logon se sampark kiya or aspataal main unke saath kiye ja rahe durvyavaar ke bare main bataaya to prashasan se baatcheet ke baad unhen aspataal se discharge kiya gaya
 The last letter written to his father In the second week of November, Saint Gopaldas wrote a letter to his father
 isamen unhone saaf likhaa tha ki sarkaar unhen dilli se hataakar kahin dur bhejnaa chaahati he
 He also asked his father to join the protests at jantar-mantar on 25 November
 buudhe pita ne kaha, piem sahib ganga kaa doosraa betaa laapata he, aap kahaan hai?sant gopaldaas ke pita ne bataaya ki unhone 5 disambar se ve ames ke medical supretendent aphis ke baahar dharne main hai
 But no one listens to them
 koi kah rahaa ki dehradun ke jollygrant aspataal ke baahar unhen chhod aayaa gaya tha to koi kah rahaa he ki aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 But now even 'gopal' found in a distant hospital is not there
 unhone bataaya ki maine dilli police ko report darj karaane kii koshish kii to report nahin darj kii gai
 Just taking the application, he was given a respite
 unke pita kaa kahana he ki jab tak meraa ladkaa nahin miltaa tab tak main yahaan se nahin hatoonga
 The father of about 75 years says that on the call of mother Ganga, PM Modi reached Banaras
 ab usee maa ke liye anshan par baithe mere gopal ke laapata hone par ve maun kyon hai?kya ve vaaki main ganga ko maa maanate hai yaa phir ganga unke liye keval siyasat kaa jariya he? bharrai aawaaj main pita ne kaha, mere man baari ho rahaa he
 Bad thoughts are coming to my mind, my son is also there
 
 
 
 There are four main demands of the saints who are fasting: 1
 ganga ke liye ganga-mahasabha dwaara prastaavit adhinium draft 2012 par sansad man charchaa karakar paas karaayaa jaae
 If this is not done, chapter one of that draft (section 1 to Section 9) should be implemented immediately by the Presidential Ordinance
 isamen ganga ke 50 pratishat pravaah ko sunishchit karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 2
 ukt prastaav ke antargat alaknanda, dhauliganga, nandakini, pinder tathaa mandakini nadiyon par sabhi nirmaanadhin or prastaavit pariyojnaayen turant nirast kii jaaen
 All proposed hydroelectric projects on Ganga and its tributaries should also be scrapped
 3
 Sections 4 (d), Forest Deduction and 4 (f) Mining, 4 (g) of the above draft Act prohibit any type of digging immediately
 4
 There should be a provisional constitution of a ganga-bhakta Parishad, with 20 members nominated who take an oath to work in the interest of Ganga and only Ganga

 Even though the first FIR of the uprising in Saina in Bulandshahr has mentioned the name of Yogesh Raj, District Convenor of Bajrang Dal 3 times, but ADG Law and Order Anand Kumar of UP kept avoiding taking his name in his press conference

 Avoiding Yogesh's name, but on Tuesday afternoon, when AD Kumar (law and Order) of UP, Anand Kumar met the media, he did not consider it appropriate to name Yogesh Raj
 jab patrakaron ne khud uskaa naam lekar ediji sahab se sawaal kiya to unhone is hinsa ke aaropee ko izzat bakhshate hue kaha ki unka naam is maamle main namit he
 He declined to name any organization and said that it is not appropriate to name any organization

 BJP will form a government in UP: Amit Shah has been busy preparing the new team of UP after finding the mind of the Sangh leaders during the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) meeting held in Lucknow
 upi main yun to bijepi netaaon kii ek lambii qatari he lekin ab puraane netaaon ke bajaay shah nai peedi ke netaaon ko taiyaar kar upi ke ran main utarane kaa man bana chuke hai
 Shah has given charge of other states to the same leaders associated with UP, who are part of his new team
 sutron ke anusaar yahi team 2017 main amit shah ke liye kaam karegi
 According to senior journalist Kumar Pankaj, Shah has tested his ability by working with these people
 isliye unhen nai jimmedaari dekar sanghathan kii drushti se or majboot karnaa chaahate hai
 Amit Shah appointed Lucknow Mayor Dinesh Sharma first as National General Secretary and then handed over the charge of important state like Gujarat
 iske atirikt ramashankar katheria ko chhattisgarh, sidgharthanath singh ko pashchim bengal kii jimmedaari di gai he
 Shah has given the responsibility of Himachal Pradesh to Shrikant Sharma of Mathura while Arun Singh of Mathura has tried to test his ability by giving him responsibility for Odisha
 bijepi sutron ne bataaya ki shah ne unheen logon ko apni nai team main shaamil kiya he, jinako vah loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan parakh chuke hai
 Shah has worked with all these people during the general elections and he wants to give these people the charge of other states and get them out of the nuances of the organization so that they can be used properly in the year 2017

 aisa avaidh khanan par lokayukta report main unhen aropit kiye jane ke baad kiya gaya tha
 The Lokayukta court had set October 3 last month to pronounce judgment on Yeddyurappa and others' bail pleas, but later adjourned it after the High Court imposed an interim stay on its proceedings

 However, on 4 October the two-member bench of the High Court lifted the ban
 iske baad lokayukta adaalat ke apni kaarywahi shuru karne kaa rasta saaf ho gaya tha
 Significantly, Yeddyurappa had to resign as Chief Minister on July 31 in connection with the illegal mining case

 Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that it will be implemented within the next three months
 ek baar lagu hone ke baad yah faisla skool ajukeshan bords dwaara liye ja rahe pariksha system main badlaav laa saktaa he
 It is worth noting that last year, the first NGO said in a report called Annual Status of Education Report i
e
 ASER that there are students in class 5 in rural areas who cannot even read properly
 iske baad hi larning outkam ko RTE main shaamil karne kii maang uthi thi
 Once this rule is implemented, teachers will be accountable for how much children have learned what they are teaching to children

 newzealand ke saath test series ke liye bhartiya test team main rohit sharma yaa shikhar dhawan kii jagah ummid kii ja rahi thi ki shaayad gautam gambhir ko ek mauka diya jayega
 In the Dilip Trophy, Gambhir's bat is speaking brilliantly, while Rohit's bat is silent
 west indies main unke balle se kul jamaa pachaas ran nikle
 Nevertheless, the selectors gave him a chance due to the name
 rohit sharma kaa balla bolnaa bhul gaya he
 His score of 9 and 41 runs in two Tests in the West Indies is his hallmark
 pichhali saat pariyon main unhone sirf ek baar 50 ran banaae hai
 But in the midst of all these failures, Rohit has managed to make a place in the team
 is bare main puche jane par mukhya chayankarta sandip patil ne kaha " rohit sharma bahut shandaar khilaadi hai
 They have a lot of talent
 lekin test cricket main unhen bahut zyada mauka nahin mila he
 We feel that not just Rohit, whoever is chosen should be given an honest chance
 tippaniyan Rohit, who made his Test debut in 2013, played a brilliant innings of 177 runs in his debut match
 uske baad bhi 111 ran jade lekin uske baad 18 test maichon main rohit ne 946 ran hi banaae, 32
 At an average of 62
 isamen chaar ardhashatak or do shatak shaamil hai
 Although Rohit is still great in one-day, but the story here is of 5 days game, which also requires patience with dum-kham
 rohit ko parakhane ke liye unhen dalip trophy main bhi ek mauka diya gaya lekin vahaan bhi unka balla bol gaya
 Perhaps the captain's close proximity to Kohli and his name did not work, otherwise his recent innings of Test matches is of no use
 vaise apane ghar main aane vaale 13 test maichon ke liye newjiland kaa test paas kar apni jagah pakki karne kaa unke paas sunaharaa mauka he
 Rohit Sharma's bat has forgotten to speak
 west indies main do test maichon main unke 9 or 41 ran kaa score isaki baangi bhar he
 He has scored 50 runs just once in the last seven innings
 lekin in tamaam naakaamiyon ke bich rohit team main jagah banane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 When asked about this, Chief Selector Sandeep Patil said, "rohit Sharma is a very good player
 unamem bahut pratibha he
 But he has not got much chance in Test cricket
 hamen lagata he ki sirf rohit hi nahin jise bhi chunaa jaae use ek eemaandaar mauka dena chahie
 The comments saal 2013 main apane test kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale rohit ne apane debyue match main 177 ranon kii shandaar pari kheli

 shaayad captain kii kohli kii kareebi or naam kaam aayaa nahin to test maichon kii unki haal philhal kii pari kisi kaam kii nahin he
 By the way, he has a golden opportunity to confirm his place by passing New Zealand Test for the 13 Test matches coming to his home

 Governor Kiran Bedi has retaliated by accusing Chief Minister v Narayanasamy of accusing the Center of adopting double standards with Puducherry
 narayansami ne puducheri ko lekar centre ke kathith dohare mandandon kii ore ishaara karte hue puducheri ko ‘transgender state’ ghoshit karne ke liye kaha tha
 When he was in the central government, he used to speak something else
 Narayanasamypuducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi said in a whatsapp message from India Today that Narayanasamy used to speak something else when he was in the central government
 kiran bedi ne centre shasit pradesh main sattarudh sarkaar par sthaneey nikaay chunaav nahin karaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The Lt

 At the same time, there is a question of implementing the schemes, then Puducherry is treated like a union territory
 narayansami ne ye bhi kaha tha ki puducheri ko ‘transgender state’ ghoshit kar diya jaae
 Narayanasamy also claimed that according to a study done by the 'madras School of Economics', Puducherry was given a fund of only Rs 1,570 crore, whereas it should have got Rs 3,500 crore

 As CM of Puducherry, he no longer wants to support her

 These are the same laws and similar rules which have been framed by the Parliament of India
 ye tab bhi nahin badale the jab wo bharat sarkaar main mantri the
 Kiran Bedi also raised the question of the local body elections in Puducherry being held for a decade
 kiran bedi ne kaha, “agar siem sthaneey nikaay chunaav kara lete to (ek dashak se nahin hua), hamaare paas sthaneey self gavarnence ke liye achche fund aa gaye hote
 These are available to the states only when the Panchayat and Urban Municipal Council elections are held
 ”kiran bedi ne saath hi puducheri main khud ke sansaadhan khadey kiye jane kii zarurat par jor diya
 The Lieutenant Governor said, "four more fingers rise towards us before pointing fingers at others

 com / 1mbzaqkszu Indian Test team captain Virat Kohli believes that due to recent changes in ODI cricket rules, batsmen are finding it difficult to score runs especially in the last over
 isisi ne haal hi main badale hai niyamgauratlab he ki antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne haal hi main vanade cricket main ballebaaji powerple niyamon main badlaav karte hue aakhri ke 10 overon main 30 gaj kii seemaa se baahar paanch fielderon ko khadaa karne kii ijaajat de di
 Earlier, in the last ten overs only four fielders could be parked outside the radius of 30 yards
 nae niyamon ke chalate ran banane main pareshaanikohli ne kaha, 'vanade international main pichley niyamon kii apeksha nae niyamon ne ballebaajon kii raah kathin kii he, khaskar bhartiya upmahadweep main
 The reason for this is that by the time of the last over, the ball becomes rough and obsolete and does not have the same speed and it becomes difficult to get a boundary on it
 'videshi pichon par ho sakati he aasaanikohli ne aage kaha, 'mere khyaal se bhartiya up-mahadweep ke baahar nae niyamon ke kaaran zyada pareshaani nahin hogi, kyonki aakhri ke overon main paanch kshetrarakshakon ke simit daayre se baahar hone ke kaaran ek-ek ran lekar chor badalte rahanaa aasaan hoga
 It will be fun to see how it is playing abroad under the new rules 
 ' The fate of Sri Lanka, which has been victorious on Indian soil for 35 years, is about to change
 
 The Has his captain Dinesh Chandimal made a 'black magic' on Team India as soon as he stepped into Kolkata
 
 The One is the continuous rain, followed by Sri Lanka winning the toss, KL Rahul's wicket falling on the very first ball of the match, Captain Kohli also returning to zero, is it not the result of the same magic which Chandimal has given to Pakistan? Tried against 
 ? On the third day of Kolkata Test, Birthday Boy is Chandimal
 Such questions are bound to arise in the mind of Indian cricket lover
 
 
 
 Because Chandimal himself has claimed that his team won the two-test series against Pakistan last month in the UAE with the help of witchcraft
 khayr, jo bhi ho aaj (18 nanvabar) chandimal 28 saal ke ho gaye
 On the third day of the Kolkata Test, he will celebrate his birthday with the hope that the stain of not winning a single Test in India is washed away
 ye bhi padhie- bharat main isliye phiseddi hai 'srilankai chitah', aankade kehete hai aisachandimal se jude jaadu-tone kii ye he kahaneuei se colombo lautne ke baad vijayi captain chandimal ne kaha tha, 'main kisi se bhi aashirwad lene ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahata hum, chaahe ve tantric ho yaa padri
 You can be talented, but cannot move forward without blessings
 'ullekhneey he ki srilanka ne haal hi main sampann test siries main pakistan ko 2-0 se haraaya tha
 Chandimal himself performed brilliantly, scoring an unbeaten 155 in the first match, while he scored a half-century (62 runs) in the second Test
 ek report ke mutabik chandimal ne jis jaadu-tone vaali kii madad lee thi, wo unke ek dost kii maa hai
 However, in 5 odis and 3 T20s, Sri Lankan sweep was cleared
 lekin tab vanade siries main upul tharanga or tii-20 siries main thisara perera ne captaini kii thi

 notebandi ko lekar sarkaar ke khilaaf ab awaajen uthne lagi hai
 Satyendra Murali, a journalist and researcher by profession, alleges that after unilaterally deciding demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a sudden drama on 8 November at 8 pm to mislead the people of the country
 patrkaar kii maane to 8 november 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa 'raashtra ke naam sandesh' live nahin tha, balki purv recorded or edit kiya hua tha
 Calling this speech live was not only unethical, but also deceived the people of the country
 bataur doordarshan main patrkaar kaa daawa he ki 8 november 2016 ko shaam 6 baje arabiai kaa prastaav or shaam 7 baje cabinet ko brif kiye jane se kai dinon pehle hi piem kaa 'raashtra ke naam sandesh' likhaa ja chukaa tha
 They allege that the Reserve Bank's right to take decisions in currency matters has been clearly violated in this case
 vahiin satyendra murali kaa aarope he ki is bare main RTI ke jariye puche jane par (PMOIN / r / 2016 / 53416) pradhanmantri karyaalay ne jawaab dene kii jagah taalamatol kar diya or aavedan ko aarthik maamalon ke vibhaag or soochna or prasaaran mantralay ko bhej diya
 For this, the RTI transfer number DOEAF / r / 2016 / 80904 and MOIAB / r / 2016 / 80180 are public
 patrkaar kaa kahana he ki yah recording piemo main hui thi, lihaaja is bare main jawaab dene kaa daayitv piemo kaa he
 It is worth mentioning that Prime Minister Narendra Modi while giving a 'message to the nation', said that from 12 o'clock at midnight today ie November 8, 2016, currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currently issued will not remain legal tender ie these currencies are invalid by law
 Will be
 centre sarkaar kii taraf se daawa kiya gaya ki yah nirnay puri tarah gopneey tha or is nirnay kii ghoshnaa se purv iske bare main sirf pradhanmantri, vittamantri samet bhartiya rigerv bank or vitt mantralay ke kuch hi adhikariyon ko maaloom tha
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told the media that the RBI proposal came at 6 pm on November 8, a cabinet meeting was called at 7 pm, in which Modi briefed the ministers and at 8 pm, Prime Minister Modi made an announcement while addressing the nation
 Granted
 patrkaar kaa kahana he ki piem modi ne 'raashtra ke naam sandesh' ko media main live band ke saath prasaarit karne ko kaha tha, jise desh ke tamaam channelon ne live band ke saath hi prasaarit kiya
 To mislead the people of the country, PM Modi made a pretense as if he had suddenly addressed the nation at 8 pm
 yah achaanak ghoshnaa vaala naatak isliye kiya gaya, taaki desh kii janata ko bharosa ho jaae ki pradhanmantri modi ne maamle ko behadgopniyarkha he, lekin aisa haragij nahin tha
 Satyendra Murali is claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'nation's Name Message' was not live on 8 November 2016, but was pre-recorded and edited
 8 november 2016 ko shaam 6 baje arabiai kaa prastaav or shaam 7 baje cabinet ko brif kiye jane se kai dinon pehle hi piem kaa 'raashtra ke naam sandesh' likhaa ja chukaa tha
 And not only that, Modi had already read this speech and recorded it
 unhone sawaal uthaaya he ki 8 november 2016 ko shaam 6 baje arabiai se prastaav mangava lene ke baad, shaam 7 baje maatr dikhaave ke liye cabinet kii baithak bulaai gai, jise modi ne brif kiya
 There is a clear difference between briefing an issue and having an in-depth discussion on it
 modi ne cabinet baithak main bina kisi se charchaa kiye hi apana ek tarafa nirnay suna diya
 This was the same decision that PM Modi had already taken and had it recorded on camera
 aise main centre sarkaar dwaara THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS) RULES, 1961 evam RBI Act 1934 kii anupaalna kis prakaar kii gai hogi? kya is maamle main raashtrapati mahoday ko soochna di gai?satyendra murali kaa aarope he ki modi ne samvidhan va niyam-kanoonon ko taak par rakhkar desh kii janata ko gumraah kiya he or apana ek tarafa nirnay thopate hue, desh main aarthik apatkaal jaise halaat paidaa kar die hai
 Due to this decision, hundreds of people including bank personnel, children, old people, women have died all over the country and it is a matter of not taking the name of pause
 puure desh main bainkon or atm mashiinon ke baahar lambii-lambii kataren lagi hui hai
 Today the common man, poor, laborers, farmers and middle class people of the country are engaged in these queues
 jabaki piem modi ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki bhrashtachar main lipt or kaala dhan rakhane vaala vyakti aaj linon main laga hua he, jabaki aam aadmi, garib, majdoor, kisaan chaiyn kii neend so rahaa he
 This statement of Modi is also being strongly criticized all around
 unhone kaha ki aaj deshbhar main log pradhanmantri narendra modi ko koste hue unhen hitler or tughlaq jaisi sangya de rahe hai
 The people of the country are saying that Modi had already informed his favorite friends about this decision
 basapa kii rashtriya adhyaksh bahan mayawati or anya vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ne bhi rajyasabha main is baat ko bhalee-bhaanti ujagar kiya tha
 Even many BJP leaders and supporters have accused PM Modi of hatching a conspiracy against the country, video clips of which have gone viral on social media and youtube
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli vidhansabha main pradhanmantri modi par ghoose lene or notebandi kii soochna apane chahete puunjipati yaar-doston ko li kiye jane ke gambhir aarope lagaae hai, jis par bijepi or aresas ne chuppi saadh rakhi he
 Contradictory among all this is that the Central Government and RBI have argued in the Gazette of India on 8 November, arguing for the closure of high-denomination 500 and Rs 1,000 notes to prevent black money and corruption
 The Central Board of Directors of Reserve Bank of India has recommended that banknotes of face value of five hundred rupees and one thousand rupees will not remain valid currency
 yah dekha gaya he ki ucch mulya ke bank noton kaa upyog gananaa main na liye gaye dhan ke bhandaaran ke liye kiya jaataa he jaisaa ki vidhi pravartan abhikaranon dwaara nakadi kii badi vasuliyon se parilakshith he
 'but just two days after that, ie on November 10, a Rs 2,000 note arrived in the market
 or isi ke saath centre sarkaar or arabiai dwaara ucch mulya ke noton ko band kiye jane ke peeche die gaye uparokt tark ke saath virodhabhas paidaa ho gaya he, kyonki centre sarkaar 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee se bhi adhik ucch mulya kaa note yani 2,000 rupee kaa note laai he
 Not only this, apart from counterfeit notes of Rs 2,000 in the market, new notes have also been recovered from the terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir
 is ghatana ne centre sarkaar ke daavon ko dhakka pahunchane kaa kaam kiya he or ab modi sarkaar katghare main khadi he
 There is also a fact that RBI is allowed to print notes up to Rs 10,000
 purv main iske antargat ek hajaar rupee se upar sidhe 5,000 rupee or 10,000 rupee kaa hi note chapa ja saktaa tha, lekin vartmaan main 2,000 rupee ke note kii nai siries gandhi kii photo ke saath chhaapi gai he, to jaahir he ki isaki anumati se sambandhit akjicutive order, notification aadi jari kiye gaye honge, lekin aaj tak janata in sambandhit akjicutive orderon, notificationon aadi ko dekhne main naakaam rahi he
 On the one hand, the Reserve Bank of India has clearly said that India has a cash-based economy, that is, most people in the country work in cash transactions, on the other hand, the central government is against cash transactions and against demonetization Later, banks are being asked to make transactions through checks, atms, mobile wallets, internet banking, etc
, while clamping down on cash withdrawals from banks
 aaj desh kii janata khud ko thaga sa mahasoos kar rahi he
 i believe that the legitimacy of this dictatorial decision with unilateral, biased, contradictory and questionable motives taken by Modi can be challenged legally before the Hon'ble Court
 piemo ko chahie ki vah RTI ke sawaalon kaa sidhaa jawaab dekar RTI act, 2005 kii anupaalna kare

 rajbhavan pahunche aditya thakare ne rajyapal se mulaakaat ke baad media se baat kii, vahaan unhone bataaya ki bhaajapa dwaara inkaar karne ke baad rajyapal offis kii taraf se hamen sarkaar banane kaa aamantran mila jisamen 24 ghante kaa vakt diya gaya tha
 Today we met him and told the governor about his desire to form the government and also asked the governor for additional time to form the government
 aditya thakare ne kaha ki hamane rajyapal ko bataaya ki ham do anya dalon ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii sthiti main he
 For this we need extra time
 unhone bataaya ki rajyapal ne 48 ghante kaa samay dene se inkaar kar diya he saath hi shivasena ko naseehat di he ki vah jald se jald sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kare
 On the technical aspect of this matter, experts say that in such a situation, the Governor reserves 24 hours for each party
 jiske tahat bijepi ko 24 ghanton kaa samay diya ja chukaa he, shivasena ne apane 24 ghante puure kar liye hai

 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha

 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has made a big statement in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, amidst discussions of building a strong grand alliance in front of BJP
 nitish kumaar ne saaf kar diya he ki wo pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar nahin hai

 Nitish Kumar denied any such possibility and said that he will not be the PM candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 Nitish also said that those people who see this ability in me, thank them, but no one can say who will become the face next
 nitish kumaar ne narendra modi ke piem banane par bhi raay rakhi
 Nitish said that who knew Modi ji for five years, but when he saw the potential in him, he became PM
 'main is kaabil nahin'nitish kumaar ne sirf piem pad kii daavedaari kii sambhaavnaaon ko hi nahin nakaara balki unhone ye bhi kaha ki wo khud ko is kaabil nahin maanate

 There have been voices from opposition camps that in 2019, opposition parties will have to unite to defeat BJP
 raajnneetik vishleshak bhi nitish kumaar ko piem pad kaa yogya ummidavaar maanate hai
 In such a situation, this statement of Nitish is going to generate many speculations

 This idiot is none other than actor Aamir Khan who is roaming different cities in connection with the promotion of his new film 'three Idiots'

 yahaan tak ki wo auto main baithkar autowale se baat karte rahe
 Standing on the bridge and talking to the common people, but still no one could recognize them
