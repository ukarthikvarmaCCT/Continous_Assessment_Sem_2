 The Prime Minister has released an app on which ten questions have been asked about black money
 bhartiya itihaas kaa itnaa bada faisla
 In the same way, it was said about the Lokpal and these surveys raised questions
 us samay kejariwal survey karke dilli ke auto par chipka dete the
 Those surveys used to be mocked, questions were asked
 sansad ke bheetar sharad yadav kaha karte the ki kanoon sadan ke vivek se banegaa
 Not from TV debate and survey
 vaise 24 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri ke ap par paanch lakh se zyada logon ne vot kar diya he
 Two questions have polled 98 and 99 percent support
 agar aap aalu kisaan hai, garib janata hai, mazdoor hai to aapako bhi survey main hissaa lenaa chahie
 The question of the survey has also been questioned, but the Prime Minister has thanked everyone for this historic partnership
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke daur kii wo tamaam talkhiyaan, teziyaan kahaan hawa ho gayi hai
 Friends and friends started fighting among themselves
 nai raajnneetik nishthaaen ban rahi thim
 Is all of that happening again? kya notebandi ke baad se aap or aapke mitra samooh main bahesbaazi tej nahin hui he
 It must have happened
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke vakt kii bahason kaa kya hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not accept the Lokpal of the Center and announced to make it its Jan Lokpal
 4 disambar 2015 ko dilli vidhansabha main dilli janalokapal bill paas ho gaya
 It was also criticized
 kaha gaya ki jab mukhyamantri kejariwal andolan karte the tab kehete the ki lokapal kii niyukti main netaa zyaada honge to eemaandaaree se kaam nahin kar saktaa he
 But when Janlokpal of Delhi came, there were more leaders in it
 jab isaki aalochana hui to anna ke kehane par dilli hoicourt ke purv chif justise ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The Jan Lokpal bill has not been implemented even after passing
 iske bhi paas hue kareeb ek saal hone ko aa gaye hai
 Currently, there are Lokayuktas in Delhi
 tippaniyan Recall both rounds
 netaaon main kitna ghamaasan hota tha
 The Lokpal to eradicate corruption did not even come
 lekin is dauraan bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye kai kanoon bane, esaiti bani
 The plan came to declare undisclosed assets
 notebandi aa gai, magar lokapal kaa pad khaali rah gaya
 Opposition has declared a nationwide outrage day on 28 November against the troubles caused by demonetisation and the government's poor preparations
 us vakt bhi yani 23 agast 2011 ko anna hazaare ke aahwan par gaiyr endie ke 9 vipakshi dalon ne rashtravyapee andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act
 isi 27 july 2016 ke hindu akhbaar kii report he ki rajya sabha or loksabhaa ne lokapal or lokayukta sanshodhan bill 2016 paas kar diya he
 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai
 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sirf amir bhrasht hai, lekin us vakt ke survey main paanch catagori ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki inamen se koun sabase bhrasht he - sarkaar, nirvaachit pratinidhi, nyaaypalika, bijnesaman, udyogpati, enjio or media
 32 per cent of the people surveyed said that the government is the most corrupt and 43 per cent said that the elected leaders are the most corrupt
 isi tarah ke survey in dinon bhi ho rahe hai
 After demonetization, the main question has become whether you are happy with the decision of the government or not
 survey ke sawaal isi ke aasapaas hai
 At that time, people were joining the survey by considering Lokpal as the savior of corruption, now forgetting it, people have started considering demonetisation as new liberator
 tab bhi vahi log the, ab bhi yahi log hai
 Can some questions like Lokpal be asked in this way - Do you know how to make black money? kya aap jaanate hai ki nagdi note ke alaava kaala dhan kitne prakaar ke hote hai? Do you know that money is kept in other countries by creating a fake company? kya aap maanate hai ki sirf notebandi se hi kaala dhan mit jayega? At the time of Lokpal it was asked how much you know about it
 notebandi ke samay bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aap kaala dhan ke bare main kya jaanate hai
 Now everyone is asking, are you with the decision of the government? At least the main question is, are you with the government's decision? Action against corruption will not oppose anyone who is involved in corruption
 'dainik jaagran' or 'hindustan' ke survey hai
 The first question of the survey of 'dainik Jagran' of 19 November is that despite the problems caused by this step, are you in favor of it? 86 included in this survey
 1 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki haa hai
 Has the government taken the right step by closing big notes - 84
 8 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki sahi kadam uthaaya he
 The fourth question is whether this will eliminate black money and further stop its path
 iske jawaab main logon kii raay main baari badlaav dikhataa he
 25 percent say they don't agree, 67
 2 fisadi kehete hai ki sahamat hai
 While 84 percent of those who consider the government's move to be good
 8 or 86
 1 percent
 20 november ko hindi akhbaar dainik hindustan main ek survey prakashit hota he
 In Jagran's survey, the percentage of those who show good steps is 85 or more
 hindustan kaa survey bataata he ki pichley das din main notebandi ke samarthak lagaataar kam hue
 On 8 November, 78 per cent of the people in the survey of Hindustan supported
 saat din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghatakar 61
 93 percent
 10 din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghat kar 46 pratishat ho gai
 The Times of India also conducted a c-voter survey on November 22, according to which 80 per cent people said that they do not care about the problems caused by demonetisation
 sara sawaal isi par he ki faisle ke samarthak hai yaa isse hui takalif ko parvaah karte hai yaa nahin
 It was during the Anna movement that Arvind Kejriwal started a referendum on every aspect related to the Lokpal
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai

 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 lokapal ke samay yah poocha gaya ki aap iske bare main kitna jaanate hai
 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money
 ab har koi yahi puch rahaa he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? kam se kam mukhya sawaal to yahi he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kaa virodh wo bhi nahin karegaa jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he
 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'
 19 november ke 'dainik jaagran' ke survey kaa pehla sawaal he ki is kadam se hone vaali pareshaani ke baavjood aap iske paksh main hai? is survey main shaamil 86
 1 percent people said that yes
 kya bade note band karke sarkaar ne sahi kadam uthaaya he- 84
 8 percent of the people have said that they have taken the right steps
 chauthaa sawaal he ki kya isse kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega or aage iske raste band ho jaaenge
 In response to this, there is a huge change in the opinion of the people
 25 pratishat log kehete hai ki sahamat nahin hai, 67
 2 percent say they agree
 jabaki sarkaar ke kadam ko acha maanane waalon kaa pratishat 84
 8 and 86
 1 pratishat he
 On 20 November, a survey is published in Hindi newspaper Dainik Hindustan
 jaagran ke survey main acha kadam bataane waalon kii pratishat 85 yaa usase adhik he
 The survey of Hindustan shows that the supporters of demonetisation decreased continuously in the last ten days
 8 november ko hi hindustan ke survey main 78 fisadi logon ne samarthan kiya tha
 Seven days later the number of supporters decreased to 61
 93 pratishat ho gai
 After 10 days, the number of supporters reduced to 46 percent
 times aaf india ne bhi 22 november ko si-voter kaa ek survey chapa he jiske anusaar 80 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki ve notebandi se hone vaali takalifon kii parvaah nahin karte
 The whole question is whether the supporters of the verdict or care about the suffering caused by it
 anna andolan ke dauraan hi arvind kejariwal ne lokapal se jude har pahalu par janamat sangrah kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 In 2011, a survey was conducted in Old Delhi and Model Town regarding what the Lokpal should be like
 tab kaaphi mazaaq uda tha ki kanoon sansad ke vivek se banataa he yaa is tarah se missd kol vaale survey se
 These surveys have returned again in the era of demonetisation
 pradhanmantri ne ap jari kiya he jisapar kaale dhan ko lekar das sawaal puche gaye hai
 Such a big decision in Indian history
 usee tarah se lokapal ke bare main kaha jaataa tha or in survey par sawaal uthte the
 At that time Kejriwal used to survey and paste on Delhi's auto
 un survey kaa mazaaq udata tha, sawaal hote the
 Within Parliament, Sharad Yadav used to say that the law will be made at the discretion of the House
 tivi kii bahes or survey se nahin
 However, more than five lakh people have voted on the Prime Minister's app within 24 hours
 do sawaalon main to 98 or 99 pratishat samarthan main mat mili hai
 If you are potato farmer, poor people, laborer then you should also take part in the survey
 survey ke sawaal par bhi sawaal hua he, lekin pradhanmantri ne is aitihaasik bhagidaari ke liye sabakaa aabhaar jataayaa he
 Recall where all the tantrums, the bulls of the Lokpal era have become
 dost-dost aapas main ladane lage the
 New political loyalties were being formed
 kahin vahi sab to phir se nahin ho rahaa he
 Has debating between you and your group of friends not accelerated since demonetisation
 zarur hui hogi
 Recall what happened to the debates during Lokpal's time
 aam aadmi party ne centre ke lokapal ko sweekaar nahin kiya or apana janalokapal banane kaa elaan kar diya
 On 4 December 2015, the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill was passed in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 isaki bhi aalochana hui
 It was said that when Chief Minister Kejriwal used to agitate, he used to say that if there will be more leaders in the appointment of Lokpal, then it cannot work honestly
 lekin jab dilli kaa janalokapal aayaa to usamen netaa hi zyaada the
 When it was criticized, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court was also included at the behest of Anna
 janalokapal bill paas hokar bhi lagu nahin hua he
 Nearly a year has passed for this too
 philhal dilli main lokayukta hai
 The comments donon daur ko yaad kiijie
 There was so much pride among the leaders
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane vaala lokapal aayaa bhi nahin
 But during this time many laws were made to fight corruption, SIT was made
 aghoshit sampatti ghoshit karne kii yojana ai
 Demonetisation came, but the post of Lokpal remained vacant
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon or sarkaar kii lachar taiyaariyon ke khilaaf vipaksh ne 28 november ko deshvyapee aakrosh diwas kaa elaan kiya he
 At that time also, on 23 August 2011, on the call of Anna Hazare, 9 opposition parties of non-nda supported the nationwide movement
 lokapal nahin aayaa ye ek tathy he par aisa nahin he ki sarkaar lokapal kanoon ke bare main bhul hi gai
 The same Hindu newspaper reported on 27 July 2016 that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have passed the Lokpal and Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2016
 magar is sanshodhan kaa sambadh lokapal kii niyukti ke liye chayan samiti kii sharton ko badalanaa nahin tha
 You know that the Leader of the Selection Committee should be the Opposition but the Leader in the Lok Sabha is not the Opposition
 isliye niyukti nahin ho rahi he
 The amendment that was passed on 27 July was because by 31 July the authorities had to submit the details of the property of themselves and their families
 adhikariyon ke alaava enjio ke board member or trustee ko bhi sampatti kaa byora dena tha
 The amendment extended the July 31 deadline
 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai

 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai
 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai
 The Prime Minister has released an app on which ten questions have been asked about black money
 bhartiya itihaas kaa itnaa bada faisla
 In the same way, it was said about the Lokpal and these surveys raised questions
 us samay kejariwal survey karke dilli ke auto par chipka dete the
 Those surveys used to be mocked, questions were asked
 sansad ke bheetar sharad yadav kaha karte the ki kanoon sadan ke vivek se banegaa
 Not from TV debate and survey
 vaise 24 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri ke ap par paanch lakh se zyada logon ne vot kar diya he
 Two questions have polled 98 and 99 percent support
 agar aap aalu kisaan hai, garib janata hai, mazdoor hai to aapako bhi survey main hissaa lenaa chahie
 The question of the survey has also been questioned, but the Prime Minister has thanked everyone for this historic partnership

 There was so much pride among the leaders
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane vaala lokapal aayaa bhi nahin
 But during this time many laws were made to fight corruption, SIT was made
 aghoshit sampatti ghoshit karne kii yojana ai
 Demonetisation came, but the post of Lokpal remained vacant
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon or sarkaar kii lachar taiyaariyon ke khilaaf vipaksh ne 28 november ko deshvyapee aakrosh diwas kaa elaan kiya he
 At that time also, on 23 August 2011, on the call of Anna Hazare, 9 opposition parties of non-nda supported the nationwide movement
 lokapal nahin aayaa ye ek tathy he par aisa nahin he ki sarkaar lokapal kanoon ke bare main bhul hi gai
 The same Hindu newspaper reported on 27 July 2016 that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have passed the Lokpal and Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2016
 magar is sanshodhan kaa sambadh lokapal kii niyukti ke liye chayan samiti kii sharton ko badalanaa nahin tha
 You know that the Leader of the Selection Committee should be the Opposition but the Leader in the Lok Sabha is not the Opposition
 isliye niyukti nahin ho rahi he
 The amendment that was passed on 27 July was because by 31 July the authorities had to submit the details of the property of themselves and their families
 adhikariyon ke alaava enjio ke board member or trustee ko bhi sampatti kaa byora dena tha
 The amendment extended the July 31 deadline
 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act

 sansad kaa monsoon satr shuukravaar ko khatm ho gaya
 The Parliament proceedings were interrupted for 13 days in this 20-day session
 gatirodh ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne jahaan vipakshi bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko kosa, vahiin bhaajapa ne apane pradarshan ko loktantr kaa hissaa bataaya
 Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Manmohan Singh on Friday attacked the BJP for stalling the Parliament continuously, saying, "we should be proud that we have a functioning democracy
" lekin is satr main hamane jo kuch dekha, vah puri tarah iskaa nakaaratmak pahalu he
 "he said," All right-thinking people in this country should stand up and jointly raise the voice that the parliamentary institutions should be allowed to function in accordance with the rules, which we have since the time of independence of the country
 Know
 " The monsoon session of Parliament was postponed indefinitely on Friday
 pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang kar rahi bhaajapa ne satr ke antim din kii kaarywahi bhi nahin chalane di
 Thus, the proceedings were interrupted for 13 days in this 20-day session
 bhaajapa adi rahi ki jis samay koyala block aavantit kiye gaye us samay koyala mantralay kar prabhaar pradhanmantri ke paas tha, isliye naitik jimmedaari lete hue manmohan singh istipha den
 Commenting on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which the BJP has made the basis of its demand, Manmohan Singh said that he highly respects the official auditor of India but his report will have to be discussed in Parliament
 unhone kaha, "ham sieji kaa ek sanstha ke taur par atyant sammaan karte hai
 We should debate their facts in the Public Accounts Committee and in Parliament
 ham hameshaa se yah ichha vyakt karte aae hai
 " bhaajapa par hamalaa jari rakhte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, "vipaksh ne yah tarika chunaa ki sieji report ke bahaane tayshuda sansthagat kaaryon kaa laabh kisi ko na mili or isliye vah sansad ko baadhit karne par adi rahi
 " manmohan singh kaha, "yah loktantr kaa nakaaratmak paksh he
 If this belief was promoted, it would be in violation of the rules of parliamentary democracy
 " unhone kaha, "bharat ke saamne kai samasyaayein hai
 Somewhere there is the problem of increasing communal tension and elsewhere there is the problem of regional and ethnic tension
 kahin aatankwaad kii to kahin naksalwad kii samasya he
 These issues should be debated but these very important issues were not allowed to be discussed before the country
 " The Prime Minister also said that due to the recession, the whole world is facing serious economic difficulties and we are trying to not let the impact of what is happening in the outside world affect India
 unhone kaha, "sansad main in muddon par charchaa honi chahie thi ki vaishvik tanaavon se nipatane or vikaas ke liye hamaari aarthik ranneeti kya honi chahie
 " manmohan ne kaha, "sansad main inamen se kuch bhi nahin hone diya gaya
 As a result, the Parliament, which is a forum on which we have unambiguous views on people's needs and their unhappiness, has been completely paralyzed
 " It may be noted that the CAG report criticized the government for not adopting the auction process for allocation of coal blocks and stated that the Central Treasury 1
 86 lakh karod rupee (37 arab dollar) kaa nuksaan hua
 The BJP, while retaliating to the Prime Minister's attack, said that 'demonstration is also a part of democracy
 ' BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said, "I want to remind Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, he too obstructed Parliament's proceedings on the Tehelka issue
" yahaan tak ki taabut ghotaale main bhi unhone sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi or hamen chor kaha tha
 "he said," Not allowing Parliament to function is also part of democracy
 " Supporting Sushma, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley termed the irregularities in coal block allocation as 'a clear example of capitalism'
 anya vipakshi dalon ne bhi alag-alag muddon ko lekar sansad main hangaamaa kiya
 Among these issues was the involvement of a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) minister in the coal block allocation scam
 subah ke sthagan ke baad loksabhaa kii baithak dopaher 12 baje jab dobaaraa shuru hui to din kii kaarywahi ke liye soochibaddh kuch dastavej sadan ke patal par rakhe gaye, or uske baad loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ne sadan kii kaarywahi anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di
 In the Rajya Sabha, the proceedings were adjourned twice on the last day of the session
 or uske baad use anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 The first adjournment took place immediately after the meeting started at 11 am
 bhaajapa sadsy ek baar phir apni siton se khadey ho gaye or koyala block aavanton main ghotaale ke liye pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang karne lage
 Members of the Samajwadi Party (SP) also created a ruckus against the Constitution Amendment Bill to give reservation in promotions to scheduled castes and tribes in government jobs and they reached the chair of the Speaker
 rajyasabha kii kaarywahi pehali baar dopaher tak ke liye or uske baad aparahn 12
 Adjourned till 45 o'clock
 jab sadan kii baithak 12
 When resumed at 45, Chairman Hamid Ansari adjourned the proceedings indefinitely
 tippaniyan Ansari informed the members that out of the 399 listed in the entire session, only 11 questions were asked verbally
 puure satr ke dauraan maatr ek din hi prashnkaal ho sakaa
 Ansari said, “A total of 62 hours were wasted due to disruptions
 " The Chairman thanked the members for their courtesy as part of the regular process
 is par sadan main tahaakaa gunj uthaa
 The monsoon session of Parliament began on August 8
 sansad ke baahar samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main manmohan singh ne sansad ko lagaataar thap rakhane ke liye bhaajapa par prahaar karte hue shuukravaar ko kaha, "hamen garv karnaa chahie ki hamaare paas ek kaaryshil loktantr he
 But what we saw in this session is totally a negative aspect of it
 " unhone kaha, "is desh main sabhi sahi soch rakhane waalon ko uth khadaa hona chahie or sanyukt rup se yah aawaaj buland kerani chahie ki un sansadeey sansthaaon main niyamon ke anuroop kaamkaaj chalane diya jaae, jinhen ham desh ke aaazaad hone ke samay se hi jaanate hai
 " sansad kaa monsoon satr shuukravaar ko anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 The BJP, seeking the Prime Minister's resignation, did not even allow the proceedings on the last day of the session to go on
 is tarah 20 dinon ke is satr main kaarywahi 13 din baadhit rahi
 BJP was adamant that the Prime Minister had charge of the Ministry of Coal at the time the coal blocks were allotted, so Manmohan Singh should resign, taking moral responsibility
 bhaajapa ne niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii jis report ko apni maang kaa aadhaar banaaya he, us par tippanee karte hue manmohan singh ne kaha ki vah bharat ke aadhikarik ankekshak ko atyant sammaan karte hai lekin unki report par sansad main charchaa kerani hogi
 He said, "we highly respect the CAG as an institution
 hamen unke tathyon par lok lekha samiti main tathaa sansad main bahes kerani chahie
 We have always been expressing this wish
 " Continuing the attack on the BJP, the Prime Minister said, "the opposition chose the way that no one should get the benefit of the scheduled institutional work on the pretext of the CAG report and hence it was adamant on disrupting Parliament
" " Manmohan Singh said, "this is the downside of democracy
 yadi is dharna ko badhaava diya gaya to yah sansadeey loktantr ke niyamon kaa ulanghan hoga
 "he said," India has many problems
 kahin badhate sampradayik tanaav kii samasya he to kahin kshetreey or jaateey tanaav kii samasya he
 Somewhere there is the problem of terrorism and Naxalism
 in muddon par bahes honi chahie lekin desh ke samaksh in atyant mahatvapurn muddon par charchaa nahin karne di gai
 " pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki mandi ke kaaran samoochaa vishwa gambheer aarthik kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he or ham prayasarat hai ki bahari duniya main jo kuch ho rahaa he, uskaa prabhaav bharat par na padane den
 He said, "these issues should have been discussed in Parliament as to what should be our economic strategy for dealing with global tensions and development
" " Manmohan said, "none of these were allowed in Parliament
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki sansad jo ek manch he, jis par ham logon kii jaruraton or unki aprasannataa par bebaak raay rakhte hai, use puri tarah pangu bana diya gaya
 " gyaat ho ki sieji kii report main koyala block aavanton ke liye nilaamee kii prakriya na apnaane par sarkaar kii aalochana kii gai he or kaha gaya he ki is kaaran kendriya rajkosh ko 1
 There was a loss of 86 lakh crore rupees ($ 37 billion)
 vahiin pradhanmantri ke prahaar par palatwaar karte hue bhaajapa kaha ki 'pradarshan bhi loktantr kaa hissaa he
 ' bhaajapa netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, "main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko yaad dilaanaa chaahati hum ki jab vah rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa the, to unhone bhi tahalaka ke mudde par sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi
 Even in the coffin scam, he interrupted the proceedings of Parliament and called us thieves
 " unhone kaha, "sansad kii kaarywahi nahin chalane dena bhi loktantr kaa hissaa he
 " sushamaa kaa samarthan karte hue rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne koyala block aavanton main aniyamittaaon ko 'poonjeevaad kaa spasht udhaaharan' bataaya
 Other opposition parties also created a ruckus in Parliament over different issues
 in muddon main koyala block aavanton ghotaale main dravid munetra kadgam (diemke) ke ek mantri kii sanliptata kaa mudda bhi tha
 When the Lok Sabha resumed at 12 noon after the adjournment of the morning, some documents listed for the day's proceedings were laid on the Table of the House, and then the Speaker of the House adjourned the House indefinitely
 rajyasabha main satr ke antim din do baar kaarywahi sthagit hui
 And then he was postponed indefinitely
 pehla sthagan subah 11 baje baithak shuru hone ke tatkaal baad hua
 BJP members once again stood up from their seats and demanded the Prime Minister's resignation for the scam in coal block allocation
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke sadasyon ne bhi sarkari naukariyon main anusuchit jatiyon va janajatiyon ko pronnati main aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke virodh main hangaamaa kiya or ve sabhapati ke asana ke paas pahunch gaye
 The proceedings of the Rajya Sabha were held for the first time till noon and thereafter at 12 noon
 45 baje tak ke liye sthagit hui
 When the House meets 12
 45 baje phir shuru hui to sabhapati hamid ansaari ne kaarywahi anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di
 The comments ansaari ne sadasyon ko suchit kiya ki puure satr main soochibaddh 399 main se maatr 11 prashn maukhik puche gaye
 During the entire session, Question Hour could be held for only one day
 ansaari ne kaha, "vyavadhaanon ke kaaran kul 62 ghante barbaad ho gaye
 " sabhapati ne niyamit prakriya ke hisse ke rup main sadasyon ke shishtachar ke liye unhen dhanyavad diya
 On this, there was a loud cry in the house
 sansad kaa monsoon satr aath agast ko shuru hua tha
 The monsoon session of Parliament was postponed indefinitely on Friday
 pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang kar rahi bhaajapa ne satr ke antim din kii kaarywahi bhi nahin chalane di

 bhaajapa adi rahi ki jis samay koyala block aavantit kiye gaye us samay koyala mantralay kar prabhaar pradhanmantri ke paas tha, isliye naitik jimmedaari lete hue manmohan singh istipha den
 Commenting on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which the BJP has made the basis of its demand, Manmohan Singh said that he highly respects the official auditor of India but his report will have to be discussed in Parliament
 unhone kaha, "ham sieji kaa ek sanstha ke taur par atyant sammaan karte hai
 We should debate their facts in the Public Accounts Committee and in Parliament
 ham hameshaa se yah ichha vyakt karte aae hai
 " bhaajapa par hamalaa jari rakhte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, "vipaksh ne yah tarika chunaa ki sieji report ke bahaane tayshuda sansthagat kaaryon kaa laabh kisi ko na mili or isliye vah sansad ko baadhit karne par adi rahi
 " manmohan singh kaha, "yah loktantr kaa nakaaratmak paksh he
 If this belief was promoted, it would be in violation of the rules of parliamentary democracy
 " unhone kaha, "bharat ke saamne kai samasyaayein hai
 Somewhere there is the problem of increasing communal tension and elsewhere there is the problem of regional and ethnic tension
 kahin aatankwaad kii to kahin naksalwad kii samasya he
 These issues should be debated but these very important issues were not allowed to be discussed before the country
 " The Prime Minister also said that due to the recession, the whole world is facing serious economic difficulties and we are trying to not let the impact of what is happening in the outside world affect India
 unhone kaha, "sansad main in muddon par charchaa honi chahie thi ki vaishvik tanaavon se nipatane or vikaas ke liye hamaari aarthik ranneeti kya honi chahie
 " manmohan ne kaha, "sansad main inamen se kuch bhi nahin hone diya gaya
 As a result, the Parliament, which is a forum on which we have unambiguous views on people's needs and their unhappiness, has been completely paralyzed
 " It may be noted that the CAG report criticized the government for not adopting the auction process for allocation of coal blocks and stated that the Central Treasury 1
 86 lakh karod rupee (37 arab dollar) kaa nuksaan hua
 The BJP, while retaliating to the Prime Minister's attack, said that 'demonstration is also a part of democracy
 ' BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said, "I want to remind Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, he too obstructed Parliament's proceedings on the Tehelka issue
" yahaan tak ki taabut ghotaale main bhi unhone sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi or hamen chor kaha tha
 "he said," Not allowing Parliament to function is also part of democracy
 " Supporting Sushma, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley termed the irregularities in coal block allocation as 'a clear example of capitalism'
 anya vipakshi dalon ne bhi alag-alag muddon ko lekar sansad main hangaamaa kiya
 Among these issues was the involvement of a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) minister in the coal block allocation scam

 It will be called unfortunate that crimes against women are increasing in the capital of the country
 dilli police ne buudhvaar ko supreme court ko bataaya ki 2012 kii tulana main is saal rajdhani main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ke maamalon main 70 fisadi se zyada kii badhottaree ai he
 Several stringent measures have been taken to protect women since the Delhi gang rape on 16 December 2012 but the Delhi Police report revealed that such incidents have doubled in the last five years
 nahin liya '16 disambar' se sabak, teji se bade rape ke maamleis saal 15 oktober tak dilli main mahilaon ke khilaaf jo aparaadh ke maamle darj kiye gaye hai, wo pichley puure saal ke mukaable zyada he
 The cases of rape have doubled since last year

 In addition to increase in sexual abuse cases, sexual abuse and molestation cases are also increasing here

 More cases of abduction of women have also been reported in the past, the number of cases of abduction of women has also increased rapidly, till October 15 last year, 1750 cases of women abduction were reported, which has reached 2900 during this year
 
 dahej hatya bhi bahut badi pareshaanidahej ke liye hatya, mahilaon se marpet ke maamle bhi pehle se kahin zyada saamne aae hai
 By October 15 this year, 2487 women registered cases of excesses by husband and in-laws, while 123 women were murdered for dowry
 darasal, dilli main ek rape cese kii exiaar nahin darj kiye jane kaa virodh karne ke liye aam aadmi party ke sadsy ke saath pulisavaale ne marpet kii thi, jiske baad court main yachika daayar kii gai thi ki is maamle main special team jaanch kare
 In the hearing of this petition, Delhi Police submitted this data to the Supreme Court
 in aankadon ko dekhte hue bench ne kaha ki puure desh main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh pichley paanch saalon main badha he
 Justice GS Singhvi said, 'women are silently facing these crimes and only a few cases are found
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki kuch yaaden bahut dukhad hai
 15 years ago in Madhya Pradesh, a student protested against a domineering Amir Ghar and was crushed by a jeep
 roj hi trainon or bason main ladakiyon ke saath yon shoshan ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 'the bench hearing this said,' Why has this been happening in the last few years? Why are people losing confidence? This did not happen 10 years ago
 aae din bas main safar karne vaali ladakiyon ke saath chhedchhad hoti he
 Women are constantly facing all this
 'bench ke mutabik, 'hamen yaad he nirbhaya (16 disambar gangrape peedita) aisi ghatnaayen pehle bhi hui hai
 People are taking to the streets because that government is only able to protect their rights
 ' bench ne is yachika par apana faisla surakshit rakhaa he

 Recently, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who was re-elected to the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka, made a new statement
 rahul kii tajposhi kii vakaalat apane hi andaaj main karte hue jairam ne kaha ki rahul congress main abhi di- phacto hai, unako di-jure ('vastut: rahul congress adhyaksh hai, lekin unhen vaastavik adhyaksh bananaa chahie') ho janaa chahie
 Jairam said that Rahul alone will not take over the reins of the Congress, but his entire team will take over
 jairam ne joda ki rahul nae idia or vijan ke saath congress ko phir se majboot karne ke liye taiyaar dikhte hai, rahul vaise hi congress kii vaapasi karaayenge, jaise sonia ne 1998 main aakar kiya
 Nobody's dream of a Congress-free India will come true
 bole jairam, to congress se bhi aayaa javaabacongress ke bayaan bahadur maane-jane vaale jairam ramesh ke bayaan par 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main congress pravaktaa sandip dikshit ne kaha ki jairam kaa ye vaala jumala ghor aapattijanak he
 The Congress has been handled by the leadership of Sonia and Rahul even in the worst of times, their statement is negative, while the change should always be on a positive note
 aakhir ham sabhi maanate hai ki rahul ji 2019 main congress kaa netritv karenge, charchaa unako adhyaksh banane kii or sanghathan main badlaav kii he, ye jaldi hona chahie, lekin timming kya ho ye hamase behatar alaakaman jaanata he, usee par choda janaa chahie
 Why Jairam is considered close to Rahul in Jayaramyasi corridors? lekin pehle jab jairam ne 60 saal se zyada ke logon ko sanghathan se hatane kii salaah di thi, tab unke bayaan ko shuruyaat main rahul kii aawaaj mana gaya or party ke bheetar hangaamaa barap gaya
 After this, Rahul himself explained in an informal conversation with the media that what happens with Jayaram's saying, i will accept what he is saying or Jayaram
 main saaf kahata hu ki congress sanghathan main youth or anubhav kaa mishran hoga, umr zyada bada factor nahin
 Yes, the youth will get a proper place
 uske baad rajyasabha member chune jate hi jairam ne taaja bayaan dekar congressiyon ke kaan khadey kar die hai
 Jairam's close aides believe that a long list of leaders wants to stop Rahul by showing political awe as he fears not getting a place in Team Rahul
 isiilie party ke senior netaaon ko aise bayaan dekar maahaul bananaa chahie, jisase jaldi rahul or unki team kaman sambhaal le
 At the same time, anti-jayaram says that Rahul has to become the president at the right time and people of his choice have to come to the organization, so a leader like Jairam should only give such statements to make a place in team Rahul and please Rahul
 It is like he is the real benefactor of Rahul and he has no greed
 agar aisa tha to 60 saal se upar waalon ko hataane kii baat karne vaale jairam ne khud 60 saal par karne par kyon tamaam gotiyaan bichaane ke baad rajyasabha kii seat hasil kii
 Jairam's opponents also do not hesitate to lash him with the honor of King
 kul milakarrahul kii tajposhior congress main bade badlaav kii baat birbal kii khichdi kii tarah ho gai he, jo pakane kaa naam hi nahin le rahi
 But seeing the opportunity, many Congress stalwarts like Jayaram, Digvijay and Sandeep missed no chance to add their political spice to it
 greater noida police ne laal kila ko udaane kii dhamkee dene vaale ek siraphire ko giraftaar kiya he
 The headman named Abdul Rahman called the Noida police control room on August 14 and threatened to blow up the Red Fort

 Finally, on 15 August, the police arrested the man from Daryaganj area of delhi
 kareeb paanch saal pehle tak is shaks kii pahchaan vedanand paswan ke taur par thi
 But later on accepting Islam, it became Abdul Rahman

 The aim of the BJP was to get more people connected to the party before the Delhi Assembly elections
 haalanki ab bijepi ne bhi dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 In the wake of the Delhi Assembly elections, the party has taken a big decision, appointing Union Minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar as the election in-charge of Delhi
 isi ke saath kendriya mantri hardip singh puri or nityanand raay ko sah prabharee banaaya gaya he
 Let us tell you that Assembly elections are to be held in Delhi within the next six months
 dilli main sattarudh aam aadmi party kaa kaarykaal farvari 2020 se pehle khatm ho jayega
 In such a situation, it is proposed to have elections before this
 ab yahaan bada sawaal ye he ki aakhirkaar dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi ne jaavdekar, hardip singh puri or nityanand raay ko hi kyon chunaa?darasal dilli kii satta se bijepi kareeb 22 saal se dur he, lekin 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mili badi jeet se bijepi utsahit he
 However, the manner in which the Arvid Kejriwal government has announced free electricity up to 200 units, free travel for women in DTC and free wi-fi, has once again created panic in Delhi BJP
 jaavdekar ko hi kyon banaaya dilli kaa chunaav prabharee?bijepi ne prakaash jaavdekar ko dilli kaa chunaav prabharee banaaya he
 Prakash Javadekar is considered a seasoned politician
 isse pehle bijepi prakaash jaavdekar ko rajasthan or karnataka kaa chunaav prabharee bana chuki he, jahaan unka pradarshan shandaar rahaa
 In the Rajasthan assembly elections, where it was believed that bjp's sweep was going to be clean, but on the contrary BJP did well
 bhale hi bijepi rajasthan main sarkaar nahin bana pai, lekin bijepi ne anti inakambency ke baavjood acha pradarshan kiya
 After this, the BJP won a big victory in the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan
 jaavdekar karnataka ke bhi chunaav prabharee rah chuke hai
 Where BJP emerged as the largest party, giving a big blow to JDS and Congress
 vahiin, loksabhaa chunaav main jedies or congress ke bich gathbandhan hone ke baavjood bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main donon partiyon ko dhul chataayee
 It was wonderful of Javadekar's efficient electoral management that the lotus blossomed here
 bijepi kaa bada sikh cheharaa hai hardip singh puribijepi ne hardip singh puri ko badi planning ke tahat dilli vidhansabha chunaav kaa sah-prabharee banaaya he
 He has been an officer of the Indian Foreign Service and is the Minister of Urban Development in the Government of India
 isse bhi ahm baat yah he ki hardip singh puri bada sikh cheharaa bhi hai, joki bijepi ke liye phydemand sabit ho sakate hai
 In Delhi, where the urban voter will be able to connect with himself, then the issue of unauthorized colony in Delhi also comes under his ministry
 abhi haal main dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ne anaadhikrut colony ko lekar bada elaan kiya tha
 Under which people living in unauthorized colony of Delhi will be able to get their homes registered
 isko lekar bijepi lagaataar kejariwal sarkaar par aarope lagaati rahi he ki kendra sarkaar ke kaamon par bhi kejariwal apni peeth thapthapa rahe hai
 The issue of unauthorized colony is a big issue in Delhi, where the Kejriwal government's poll can be opened
 nityanand raay ko he sanghathan kaa lanbaa anubhavabihar se taalluk rakhane vaale nityanand raay ko bhi bijepi ne dilli vidhansabha chunaav kaa sah-prabharee banaaya he, joki yadav jati se aate hai or inkaa sanghathan main bahut lanbaa anubhav he
 In view of all these things, BJP has appointed Nityanand Rai as co-incharge of Delhi Assembly Election
 vahiin, kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko dilli kaa chunaav prabharee niyukt kiye jane par dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki bhartiya janata party ko prakaash jaavdekar ne bahut achche tareeke se sinchaa he
 Wherever his duty was imposed, the party won
 unhone kaha ki jaavdekar, hardip singh puri or nityanand raay kaa jald hi swaagat kiya jayega
 The BJP is fully prepared for elections in Delhi

 The Samajwadi Party has announced its alliance with the BSP
 shanivaar ko sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or basapa supremeo mayawati press conference karne ja rahe hai
 This press conference is going to take place where SP and Congress announced an alliance for assembly elections 2 years ago
 vah 29 janvari 2017 kii taarikh thi
 Today 12 January 2019
 lakhanu kaa hotel taj ek baar phir ek nae gathbandhan kaa gavaah banegaa
 Time will be almost the same, the place will be the same but there will not be a partner of the alliance
 saal 2017 main jab akhilesh or rahul gandhi ne sanyukt press conference kii thi to donon ne ek hi rang kii sadri bhi pahan rakhi thi
 It was then said that the 'boys of UP' would together change UP
 naaraa diya gaya tha ki 'upi ko yah saath pasand he'
 The SP gave the Congress 100 assembly seats, but the Samajwadi Party, which ran the government with an absolute majority in the BJP storm, was reduced to 47 seats
 congress ko keval 7 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 The BJP got a thumping majority and Yogi Adityanath became the CM of the state
 saal 2019 tak aate-aate halaat badal chuke hai vidhansabha main sapa or congress kaa gathbandhan safal nahin hua or baad main mulaayam singh ke bayaan ne isamen tadakaa laga diya

 It is believed that the Congress cut the vote of BJP and with the support of BSP, the seat came to the sp's seat
 philhal congress is gathbandhan se baahar he
 Rahul Gandhi has also said that the Congress should not be underestimated
 teen rajyon rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main jeet ke baad congress ke hausale buland hai or kaaryakartaaon main bhi josh aa gaya he
 In 1993, Mulayam Singh and Kanshi Ram formed an alliance, Kalyan Singh resigned after the demolition of Babri Masjid and was going for re-election
 tab ek naaraa chalaa tha 'mili mulaayam kanshiram hawa main ud gaye jai shri ram'
 In the 1993 elections, Mulayam's party got 109 seats and BSP got 67 seats
 2019 ke chunaav main saamne modi hai, unke sipahasaalar amit shah kaa daawa he ki 2014 main upi main 73 siton par jiti mili thi is baar 74 jeetenge 72 nahin honge

 Taking a lesson from the UP elections, the Congress in Gujarat will only put its state leaders in front of Modi, through social media the Congress will campaign that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi will not be formed
 isliye vijay rupani varsej bharat singh, shakti singh, siddharth patel, arjuna modhwadiya or duusare sthaneey netaaon ko hi saamne rakh kar chunaav ladaa jayega
 On this, Bharat Solanki directly said that the public's trust in the bjp's CM and other leaders has been lost, so Modi is scared

 ) dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne jaise hi rajdhani main bijli ke daam aadha karne kaa elaan kiya, vaise hi desh kii raajnneeti ko 440 volt kaa jhatka lag gaya
 The Congress also supported the Kejriwal government and also the power companies which supply electricity to the common man of Kejriwal
 kejariwal kaa asar mumbai main bhi dekhne ko mila
 It is only because of Kejriwal that on Monday, even the big leaders of Congress on the streets of Mumbai became common people with the aim of reducing electricity prices
 pradarshnakariyon ne bijli company ke maalikon ko chor tak kaha
 These questions are alive before and after elections in Delhi
 
 
 -kya dilli main bijli companiyaan bade paimaane par dhaandhlee kar rahi hai
 - Are electric meters running fast
 -kya bijli ke bilon main bhi gadabadi ho rahi he
 - Will Kejriwal really give electricity at half the price? -kya kejariwal gadabadi karne waalon ko jail pahunchaa paaenge
 Aaj Tak has conducted a major sting operation in the last few days on these questions, which brought the country's politics to a boil
 bijli kii siyasat par hue is sabase bade sting oparation par aaj tak ne bijli companiyon ke bade-bade afasaron ke dil kii baat khufia camere par record kii
 In this sensational sting operation, big revelations have been made by big officials of big companies supplying electricity to Delhi
 bisies rajdhani ke vaais pressindet (oparesans) ajay kumaar kehete hai audit karo, gandhi main bhi chaar-paanch nikal aayega
 At the same time, the consultant of the same company R
 si
 According to Natarajan, nothing will come out of this audit
 ye sach he ki arvind kejariwal ne desh kii siyasat badalane kii koshish main jab dilli kii sadakon par ghar-ghar jaakar aam aadmi ke meter jodne shuru kiye, to us vakt ye tay ho gaya tha ki agar kejariwal kii sarkaar bani to pehla jhatka 440 volt kaa hi lagegaa
 Congress leader Arvinder Singh Lovely is also supporting Kejriwal's government in Delhi in the sting operation 'operation 440 Volts' on the power politics till date
 lavali ek jatke se kejariwal kii sarkaar ko giraane kii takat rakhte hai
 Arvind is the Chief Minister because of Lovely
 lavali kii vajah se hi aam aadmi ko aadhe daam par bijli mil rahi he
 Not only Lovely, another powerful leader of Congress and former power minister of Delhi Aaron Yusuf is also seen speaking in the intelligence camera
 vidhansabha main donon haathon se kejariwal kaa samarthan karne vaale arvinder singh lavali upar se bhale hi meharbaan dikhen, lekin unke man ke bheetar siyasat chal rahi he
 When Kejriwal announced to reduce the price of electricity by half to woo the common man, then Lovely might have received a shock of 440 volts from within
 kejariwal kii sarkaar chalaane vaale lavali kaa kahana tha ki aam aadmi ko sabsidi to congress bhi dena chaahati thi, lekin dilli sarkaar kii tijori main paise hi nahin the
 He said that if there is no money then from where will Kejriwal bring the money
 abhi vidhansabha ke andar koi bhi seshan nahin hua he
 Now they are saying that we will make the adjustment
 agar karte hai to ye puri tarah se avaidh he
 The responsibility of the officers will be fixed in this
 khufia camere par congress ke diggaj netaa arvinder singh lavali khulte gaye
 He even went as far as to say that the scheme for the common man has announced, is either a mess of government accounts or Kejriwal is lying
 unhone kejariwal par bijli ke maamle main jhooth bolne kaa iljaam lagaaya
 Lovely was now speaking fully and speaking, he also revealed that a corruption case could be filed against Kejriwal
 ham ye nahin expect kar rahe hai ki ek maheene main ye thik kar denge
 We want to give them good time
 lavali ne to bijli gadabadi main kejariwal ke khilaaf piiel tak dalwane kii baat kahi
 Arvind Kejriwal's government in Delhi is running with the support of the Congress
 lekin bijli bill kii gadabadiyon ko lekar aap ke sakht rukh ke baad sawaal he ki congress kya karegi
 In the sting operation 440 Volt till date, Congress leader Arvind Singh Lovely claimed that his government had ordered the audit of the companies
 or haa, agar kejariwal ko lagata he ki gadabadi hui to sibiai jaanch kara len
 Talk of supporting Arvind Kejriwal's government inside the House and the lawsuit against Arvind Kejriwal outside the House
 kahin naa kahin aam aadmi kii badhati lokapriyata or dilli ke ghar-ghar main aap kaa badhata dabadabaa dilli pradesh congress adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali ko pareshaan kar rahaa he
 In the case of electricity at half the price, when we asked Lovely that the electricity companies were messing up and the meters installed in many houses were running fast, Lovely replied with astonishment that his own government Was raised
 ajtakansar, ek baat or samajhnaa chaah rahaa hum ki jo meter tej chalate hai, isaki jaanch ke aadesh maine jo ek statement main padhaa he
 
 
 You can go to the DC office and compile
 lavalijaaye hamaari sarkaar ne kar rakhaa he order
 It is the same before and still
 lekin ye he media
 You do not have time to show our order to people
 iske (kejariwal ke) order dikhaane kii aapako fursat he
 That's the only difference
 or koi fark nahin he
 Who ordered the CAG audit
 
 
 hamaari sarkaar ne kiya
 Aaron ji was the power minister, our government, he did
 uski khabar aap us vakt nahin dikhaa rahe the
 Now showing
 jaahir he ki aam aadmi party or kejariwal kii badhati lokapriyata se congress ke donon diggaj netaa lavali or haaron yusuf pareshaan dikhe
 That is when we asked Lovely that the Aam Aadmi Party could get a CBI inquiry on him in the power case
 ajtakanek sawaal or chaahunga sar aapse
 
 
 Where do you see things going from here? CAG audit aapako lagata he ki bahaanaa he
 Information is being received from the sources of the government that perhaps they are talking about following you or bringing you people under the purview of CBI Inquiry
 agar CAG audit main gadbady nikalati he to jo log maan kar chal rahe hai ki ho saktaa he ki gadbady ho
 
 
 And get it investigated by CBI
 
 
 lavalihkaren
 
 
 Exactly be investigated
 
 
 matlab aapako kya lag rahaa he ki company main ham diarector hai kya
 
 
 Lovely was annoyed to hear the CBI and that is why he meant to say that he is the director of the power company which will be implicated
 jaraa ek baar phir suniye lavali kaa jawaab
 Lovely
 
 
 bilkul jaanch karai jaae
 
 
 What do you think we are directors in the (electricity) company? 
 
 ye ek baat bataaie ki ye ek RTI activist he
 What do you think that he (kejriwal) would not have called for any government file in the RTI for so long, which are seeing the file today
 
 
 wo RTI main bhi dekh chuke hai, jo file ye mukhyamantri banake dekhenge
 Now is the time for right to information
 
 
 wo file to unhone RTI main bhi dekh lee hogi
 Aaj Tak: Sources in the government believe that there is a readiness to go to the CBI as well
 
 
 lavalihto jaaen naa
 
 kisne manaa kiya he
 
 
 We will welcome that inquiry
 
 
 inhone jo chitthee likhi he, usamen sab likhaa tha
 We have supported the inquiry by agreeing to it only
 
 
 isliye samarthan diya he ki doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jaae
 'if you want a CBI inquiry, the Chief Minister' Lavali was speaking openly, so we thought that along with Lovely, why not let the heart of Congress leader and former Power Minister Aaron Yusuf in the Delhi Assembly also be known
 ajtakah aapaki beuroperesi kya bataati he (sarkaar ke bare main)
 
 
 Aaron Yusuf: Now what to talk about bureaucracy
 
 
 ab jo jhel rahe hai, wo jhel hi rahe hai
 
 
 But we could see what they are passing to
 
 
 lekin sawaal is baat kaa he ki har cheez ko kehake mukar janaa
 
 
 Right now (kejriwal) is saying something and changing it the next minute
 
 
 'apni baat se hi baar-baar badal jate hai kejariwal'congress sarkaar main bijli mantri rahe haaron usoof kaa kahana he ki arvind kejariwal kaa kaam karne kaa tarika sahi nahin he
 Ministers are doing work that is not the work of a minister
 ajtakansar, bijli kii sahyogi companiyaan
 
 
 They are selling power on cheap rate
 
 
 ye issue kya he
 
 
 You ordered inquiry on this
 
 
 haaron usufianinyster doesn't go into these details
 
 
 
 it is power department
 
 they have senior officers
 
 
 it DERC which checks where power is sold
 
 
 or kahaan se kharid rahe hai
 
 
 The job of DERC
 
 
 Its not the job of ministers
 
 
 when they submit their ARR
 
 annual revenue requirement
 
 
 apni summit karte hai
 
 
 It is the duty of DERC to go into the details of how much power is bought and sold
 
 
 That is not concern of the government
 
 
 Why DERC is created
 
 It is clear that the Congress is supporting the Kejriwal government, but the power shock is being felt by the companies as well as the Congress
 audit par afasaron kaa kya he kahana?dilli main bijli baantne vaali companiyon ke bade adhikariyon ne bhi hamaare sting oparation 440 volt main khulaasa kiya he
 The promise of providing electricity at half the cost to the common man's houses has given a shock of 440 volts to the Congress as well as the power companies
 dilli pradesh congress adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali or shila sarkaar main bijli mantri rahe haaron usoof ne jo kuch bhi kaha wo aapane padhaa
 Now let us tell you what the officers of the power companies have to say
 bisies-rajdhani ke vaais president ajay kumaar se jab kaha gaya ki unki company kaa audit hone ja rahaa he to audit ke naam par hi wo bhadak gaye
 Ajay Kumar said that the action of Kejriwal government has no meaning
 bisies-rajdhani ke salaahkaar aar si natarajan bhi kahin naa kahin bijli companiyon par bhrashtachar ke aarope se naaraaz dikhe
 Tata's TPDDL company also supplies electricity in Delhi
 company ke siio kaa kahana he ki wo audit kaa swaagat karte hai
 On the other hand, Shakti Sinha, the former power secretary of Delhi, believes that the power supply has been rigged and Kejriwal's decision is correct
 ab bijli kaa daam aadha hoga yaa nahin or agar hoga bhi to kab hoga, ye to pataa nahin lekin congress kii maane to agar sarkaar kii tijori kaa haal khasta he to ye vaade aadhe adhure hi rahane vaale hai

 lekin usase bhi pehle akhbaar padhate hai
 In my eyes, a newspaper that can edit dilli main aapane katha kaa vishay bhi maanas rajdhani rakhaa lekin rajdhani par kabje ko lekar khaasi jang chhidi he or jamkar durvaad ho rahaa he

 The Income Tax Department has raided many places of the Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family, which were surrounded by allegations of corruption for the past several days
 in chhaapon kii chot se rajya ke raajnneetik sameekaran bhi badalte najar aa rahe hai
 Lalu Prasad Yadav himself has confirmed these speculations like a tweet

 Lalu Yadav Income Tax Department raided 22 places of Laloo Prasad Yadav on Tuesday morning

 After these raids, Lalu Yadav tweeted that the BJP should have a new coalition partner
 lalu prasad jhukne or darane vaala nahin he
 Till last breath, i will keep fighting against fascist forces
 lalu ke is twit ke bare main mana ja rahaa he ki wo kisi or ko nahin balki rajya main apni sahyogi party janata dal united ko bijepi kaa nayaa sahyogi bataa rahe hai
 This is because the differences between RJD and JDU have been deepening for the last few days

 Nitish's statement is seen as a preparation for his entry into the NDA as a section of the opposition and media often predicts Nitish's standing before Modi in the 2019 general elections

 yadi nitish argedy se naata todakar endie main jate hai to congress ke 27 vidhayak bhi sarkaar se hat jaaenge
 In such a situation, Nitish will need 51 more mlas to save the government

 In addition, LJP K2, RLSP K2, HAM K1, CPI ML Liberation have three and independent 4 mlas
 yani jediu or bijepi milakar sarkaar bana sakate hai kyonki donon partiyon ke vidhayakon kaa aankada kul milakar 124 baithta he

 The left-handed batsman also refused to be compared with the 1983 world champion team

 Yuvraj, who has played 265 odis so far, believes that attitude regarding batting powerplay will be very important

 Sometimes it can be favorable to you and in some circumstances it can be harmful
 yah mahatvapurn hoga ki aap kis samay powerple lete hai
 Usually you take powerplay when the batter is frozen and if you do not take it, then it will have to be taken 45 overs
 yuvaraj ne iske saath hi kaha ki bhale hi vah aajkal lagaataar gendbaaji kar rahe hai, lekin khud ko visheshgy gendbaaj nahin maanate hai
 He said, i do not consider myself an expert bowler
 jab bhi mujhe gend saunpi jaati he, main apni gendbaaji kaa lutf uthaata hum
 The day i started thinking that i am an expert bowler, the batsmen would start beating me
 unhone kaha, main khud ko gendbaaj nahin maanata
 In the last 50 odis, i bowled more because we do not have a specialist left-arm spinner
 isliye meraa kaam saat-aath over karnaa he

 It was only after underworld don Chhota Rajan was caught in Indonesia on October 25 that the exercise was started to deport him to India
 fori taur par bhale hi ye maan liya gaya ki mohan kumaar ke naam ke farji passport par safar kar rahaa shaks bharat kaa bhagoda chota rajan hi he
 But it needed solid evidence to report it to India
 chota rajan mumbai kaa he or uske khilaaf sabase zyada maamle bhi mumbai main darj hai isliye bharat main interpol kii nodel agency sibiai ne mumbai police se thos saboot muhaiyaa karne ko kaha
 The Mumbai Police also started searching for Rajan's crimes in dust files in police stations
 dekhte hi dekhte 70 ke kareeb aparaadhon kii suchi taiyaar ho gai
 His school living certificate named Rajendra Nikhalje, issued on 21 April 1973, was also found
 lekin aisa koi saboot nahin mila jisase ye sabit ho paye ki indonesia main pakadaa gaya shaks or bharat kaa bhagoda rajan ek hi shaks he
 Now the search for fingerprints on Rajan's hand started
 par rajan ke khilaaf darj zyaadaatar maamle uske desh chhodane ke baad ke the
 So there were no fingerprints in it
 rajan chembur ke tilak nagar kaa rahane vaala tha or aparaadh kii duniya main pehla kadam bhi usne vahiin rakhaa tha
 It was learned from the old officers that a murder case was registered against Rajan in 1980 and 35 years before he escaped from Mumbai and he was also arrested in it
 matlab uski ungaliyon ke nishaan liye gaye the
 The comments bas phir kya tha, tilak nagar kii mahila police nireekshak manisha shirake ke netritv main 6 pulisavaalon ko us fil kii talash kaa kaam diya gaya
 After hard work, that file was found but the documents kept in it were torn
 haath ke panjon ke nishaan vaale kaagaj ke bhi 3 tukade ho chuke the
 After adding all the three pieces, he was scanned and then got Rajan's fingerprints
 usee nishaan ke bal par bharat ye sabit kar paaya ki pakadaa gaya shaks bharat kaa bhagoda chota rajan he or wo bharat kaa hi naagarik he
 According to experts, if Chhota Rajan's 35-year-old finger prints were not found, then he would have to undergo a DNA test to identify Rajan

 In which many days would pass
 chota rajan mumbai kaa he or uske khilaaf sabase zyada maamle bhi mumbai main darj hai isliye bharat main interpol kii nodel agency sibiai ne mumbai police se thos saboot muhaiyaa karne ko kaha
 The Mumbai Police also started searching for Rajan's crimes in dust files in police stations
 dekhte hi dekhte 70 ke kareeb aparaadhon kii suchi taiyaar ho gai
 His school living certificate named Rajendra Nikhalje, issued on 21 April 1973, was also found
 lekin aisa koi saboot nahin mila jisase ye sabit ho paye ki indonesia main pakadaa gaya shaks or bharat kaa bhagoda rajan ek hi shaks he
 Now the search for fingerprints on Rajan's hand started
 par rajan ke khilaaf darj zyaadaatar maamle uske desh chhodane ke baad ke the
 So there were no fingerprints in it
 rajan chembur ke tilak nagar kaa rahane vaala tha or aparaadh kii duniya main pehla kadam bhi usne vahiin rakhaa tha
 It was learned from the old officers that a murder case was registered against Rajan in 1980 and 35 years before he escaped from Mumbai and he was also arrested in it
 matlab uski ungaliyon ke nishaan liye gaye the
 The comments bas phir kya tha, tilak nagar kii mahila police nireekshak manisha shirake ke netritv main 6 pulisavaalon ko us fil kii talash kaa kaam diya gaya
 After hard work, that file was found but the documents kept in it were torn
 haath ke panjon ke nishaan vaale kaagaj ke bhi 3 tukade ho chuke the
 After adding all the three pieces, he was scanned and then got Rajan's fingerprints
 usee nishaan ke bal par bharat ye sabit kar paaya ki pakadaa gaya shaks bharat kaa bhagoda chota rajan he or wo bharat kaa hi naagarik he
 According to experts, if Chhota Rajan's 35-year-old finger prints were not found, then he would have to undergo a DNA test to identify Rajan
 uske milan ke liye rajan ke bhai or bahan kaa bhi diene test karana padataa
 In which many days would pass
 ab rajan ke haath kii ungaliyon ke nishaan kii talash shuru hui
 But most of the cases registered against Rajan were after he left the country
 isliye usamen ungaliyon ke nishaan nahin the
 Rajan was a resident of Tilak Nagar in Chembur and he also took the first step in the world of crime
 puraane afasaron se pataa chalaa ki 35 saal pehle yani mumbai se bhaagane ke pehle 1980 main rajan ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj hua tha or wo usamen giraftaar bhi hua tha
 Meaning his fingerprints were taken
 tippaniyan What was it then, under the leadership of the woman police inspector Manisha Shirke of Tilak Nagar, 6 policemen were given the task of searching for that file
 kadi mashkkat ke baad wo fil to mili lekin usame rakhe dastavej fat chuke the
 There were also 3 pieces of paper with markings on the hands
 teenon tukdon ko jodakar use scan kiya gaya tab jaakar rajan kii ungaliyon ke nishaan mil paye
 On the same trail, India was able to prove that the person caught is the fugitive little Rajan of India and he is a citizen of India
 jaankaron ke mutabik agar chota rajan ke 35 saal puraane finger prints nahin milte to rajan kii pahchaan ke liye uskaa diene test karana padataa
 Rajan's brother and sister also had to undergo a DNA test to match him
 jisame kai din guzar jate

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne shapath lene ke dauraan kaha tha 'agar koi paisa maange to manaa mat karnaa setting kar lenaa, apane mobile main recording kar lenaa, hamen bataanaa, ham use jail bhej denge
 We will end corruption in five years
 ' The burden of Kejriwal's anti-corruption fight is on the shoulders of this Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB)

 centre sarkaar ke notification ke mutabik, dilli sarkaar kii asibi centre sarkaar ke adheen mahakamon ke kisi bhi karmchaaree ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar sakati
 Perhaps this is the reason why big cases like Commonwealth, Jal Board, Transport, CNG scams have not reached any end so far

 However, reality is completely different

 website 'radaronline dot com' ke mutabik aniston in dinon mexico main apane mangetar justin therox ke saath chhuttiyaan bitaa rahi hai
 He was seen here at Hotel Cabana
 pehle kaha ja rahaa tha ki 43 varshiya aniston apane garbhvatee hone kii baat chupaane ke liye badi jackets va anya poshaaken pahan rahi hai
 The past never gives up
 saiyad liyakat shah ne pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) ke mujaffarabad se is ummid ke saath 1,000 kimi lanbaa safar shuru kiya tha ki aakhirkaar vah is raste se jammu-kashmir ke kupwada main apane gaanv tak pahunch jayega
 The evening of March 20 was still deep when the former Hizbul Mujahideen militant reached the Sonauli check post along the indo-nepal border with his wife Akhtarun Nisa and step-daughter Jabina
 45 varshiya shah ek bhagode kii jindagi se ajiz aa chukaa tha
 He had no wish except to surrender and return to his village
 lekin use kya pataa tha ki khushi-khushi ghar vaapasi uske liye tab bhi dur kii kaudi thi
 Shortly after entering the Indian border, he was arrested by a team of Special Cell of Delhi Police waiting there
 uske baad police ne ek aadhikarik bayaan jari karke daawa kiya ki usne dilli main ek bade aatankwaadi hamale ko naakaam kar diya he
 Police described Shah as a notorious Hizbul militant and said that there was a conspiracy of a fidayeen attack around Holi
 police ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki shah se poochtacha main mili jaankaree ke aadhaar par dilli ke jama masjid ilaake ke haji araafaat guest house par maare gaye chaape main ek eke-56 rifl or teen grenade baraamad hue
 Shah's arrest has been exacerbated by the tension between the governments of the Center and Jammu and Kashmir over the hanging of Parliament attack convict Mohammad Afzal Guru on 9 February
 mukhyamantri umr abdulla maanate hai ki dilli police ne yah puri kahani gadhi he or ve is par vyangy bhi karte hai, “main pehali baar sun rahaa hum ki hamalaa karne aae kisi aatankwaadi ke ek haath main uski bivi kaa haath or duusare main hathiyaar the, maano vah picnic ke liye ja rahaa ho
 He insisted that a rehabilitation scheme for terrorists willing to improve with the approval of the Union Home Ministry was being run and Shah had apologized under the same scheme
 ve aagaah bhi karte hai ki shah kii giraftaar se hathiyaar daalane kii ichha rakhane vaale aatankwaadi sashankit hokar apana iraadaa badal sakate hai
 This rehabilitation scheme for terrorists has been in operation since November 2010 and since then more than 300 such terrorists who have crossed the border and fled to pok have returned home
 iske badale unhen na to lambit aapraadhik maamalon kii vaapasi kii guarantee milti he or na hi koi aarthik muaavja
 Shah was just 27 years old when he first crossed the Line of Control in 1995, son of the well-known Sufi Maulana of Dardpora, a village surrounded by cherry orchards in the beautiful Lolab Valley of Kupwara
 jammu-kashmir police bhi maanati he ki shah hijbul se judaa tha or usne pioke main aatankwaadi shivi main prashikshan bhi liya tha lekin us par kabhi kisi aatankwaadi vaardaat main shaamil hone kaa aarope nahin laga
 It has been heard that Shah returned in 1996, but after a year, when the police got to know about this, pok ran back
 uski pehali bivi ameena shah ne 2011 main uske aatmasamarpan kaa aavedan kupwada police ko diya tha, lekin usne shah ke saath jammu-kashmir lautne se inkaar kar diya
 Shah became disenchanted with Pakistan when he was left on his side and forced to do minor jobs in Muzaffarabad to earn a living
 ghar se dur jindagi ko kuch aasaan banane ke liye shah ne 1997 main pioke jane ke kuch hi samay baad apane se 10 saal badi ek bevaa naseema bibi se nikaah kar liya
 In 2006 she married third wife Hassan Gilani, a Hizbul terrorist, to Bewa Akhtarun Nisa
 hasan bhartiya sena ke haathon 1995 main maaraa gaya tha
 Shah's wife went to Muzaffarabad with her daughter on an Indian passport
 saat saal baad, akhtarun nisa ne apane shuhar shah ko samajhaayaa-bujhaayaa ki use bharat sarkaar kii maafee yojana kaa phayda uthaanaa chahie
 Although the Rehabilitation Policy is officially considered the entry way to the Indira Gandhi International Airport of poonch-rawalakot, uri-muzaffarabad, Wagah and Delhi, many of the more than 300 terrorists who returned since 2011 were successfully tried Nepal adopted the route
 shah or uske parivaar ne bhi ise raste ko chunaa
 Akhtarun Nisa, now living in his father's house in Kralpora (kupwara), recounts the situation of how Shah managed to run the chicken shop in Muzaffarabad, the capital of pok, with the expense of returning to India by selling a piece of land he had bought hard

 25 march ko jammu main vidhansabha ko sambodhit karne ke darmyaan umr ne bade hi talkh andaaj main bharat sarkaar par kashmiriyon ke saath pakshpaat karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He questioned the hanging of Afzal Guru 'hurriedly'
 saath hi, sashastr sena visheshadhikaar adhinium (eexspie) ko hataane ke mudde par centre sarkaar ke aditol rukh par bhi naaraazgi jataai
 AFSPA is also not applicable in Naxal-affected areas with more violence than Kashmir

 ”vaise, saiyad ali shah gilaani jaise kattar algaavvaadi ko chhod den, apekshaakrit narampanthi mirvij umr faruk ne bhi ab tak is maamle par koi pratikriya nahin di he

 hathiyaar tham chuke kashmiriyon ko mukhyadhara main laane ke liye shuru kii gai sarkaar kii punarvaas niti kii koi bhi safalataa ghati main algaavvaadiyon ke mansoobon par pani pher degi
 However, investigators from the Delhi Police's Special Cell insisted that Shah's return was not a story of a return home with golden memories as propagated by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, the Jammu and Kashmir Police and the housemates of this former terrorist
 special cell ke ek adhikari ne kaha, “yakeenan vah isamen shaamil tha
 He was the one from whom information was recovered from Jama Masjid area
 ” india today se baatcheet main unhone kaha ki yadi dilli police kaa iraadaa keval uske khilaaf pukhta maamla taiyaar karnaa rahata to sonauli main hi uske paas hathiyaar milanaa dikhaa diya gaya hota

 purvi dilli main yamuna nadi ke paas ghonda gujaran or sonia vihaar naamak jagah par jab se didie ne east emsidi ko landphil site banane ke liye jagah di he, tabhi se is prastaav kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 All political parties have come to the ground to fight the issue
 sonia vihaar or ghonda gujaran main landphil site na banane dene ke virodh main congress party ke kaaryakartaaon ne joardaar pradarshan kiya
 On this occasion, Congress workers as well as local people of the area raised the issue of cutting down trees in large quantities
 saath hi ghonda gujaran or sonia vihaar menlandphil saitan banane dene kii maang ko buland kiya
 Former MLA from the area Bhishma Sharma said that around the Yamuna that this land falls in the green belt and in view of the thousands of tree plants present here, there will not be a pile of garbage here at any cost
 bhishma sharma ne kaha kibijepishasit emsidi or BJP kii centre sarkaar ke adheen didie milakar yamuna ke aasapaas kii jameen ko ganda kar rahe hai
 Due to this, the dense population of lakhs settled here will be forced to breathe poisonous
 maukey par aae ilaake ke sthaneey logon ne bhi guhaar lagaai ki yahaan maujuud lakhon ped-paudhon ko dekhte hue landphil site na banaai jaae
 Congress workers of the area also burnt the effigy of Delhi BJP MP Manoj Tiwari on this occasion
 sthaneey logon ne jangal main jaakar pedo par raksha sutara bhi baandhe or kaha ki ham vachan lete hai ki kisi bhi keemat par in ped-paudhon ko katane nahin denge or na hi yahaan par landphil site banane di jaaegi

 ipel main ravivaar ko do baar kii champion kolkata niterides kii takkar dely dairedevills se hogi
 Delhi has made a fresh start by changing the team once again
 aise main dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki team is baar ank talika main rahati he
 Everyone knows how strong Kolkata Knight Riders are on their home ground
 dilli ke saath mukaable main team kii koshish shuruyaat se hi vining combination talashne kii hogi
 Shah Rukh Khan, who was IPL champion in 2012 and 2014, has not made much changes in the team
 pehle kii tarah yahaan team ke top order main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he, haalanki team main teen nae ol-rounder jarur dikhenge
 Kolkata gave Colin Munro 30 lakhs, Jason Holder 7 lakhs and John Hastings 1
 3 karod main kharida he
 For the past few seasons, Kolkata's success has been based on the performance of a select few players
 ballebaaji main captain gautam gambhir or openar robin uthppa to gendbaaji main shaakib al hasan or sunil naren
 It is evident that the Knight Riders would have got a boost after Naren's bowling action was cleared by the ICC
 yahaan dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki naren badale hue ection ke baad ballebaajon ko kitna pareshaan kar pate hai
 On the other hand, this time the responsibility of crossing the fleet of Delhi is on the shoulders of Zaheer Khan
 team main yuva or anbhavi khilaadiyon kaa talmail hone ke saath dilli ne ocshan main teen bade daanv khele hai
 England's Sam Billings, Sanju Samson and Carlos Brathwaite will have three strong faces in the team

 Bought for 2 crores
 tippaniyan Four sixes from Brathwaite made the West Indies champions
 agar dilli ke liye bhi ve isi andaaz main khelte hai to team kii kismat jarur palat sakati he
 However, before the start of the tournament, captain Zaheer has relied on batsmen like JP Duminy and Quinton de Kock
 vaise dilli ke liye ek or khaas baat he ki team india ke mistar bharosemand khilaadi rahul david team ke coach hai
 Making Delhi a success in the IPL will be a great litmus test for Zaheer as well as Dravid
 pichley sizan main kolkata semifinal tak nahin pahunch saki to dilli saatven sthaan par rahi
 In such a situation, both teams will try to win the first match and catch the rhythm
 kolkata niterides apane dharelu maidan par kitni majboot he yah sabko pataa he
 In the match with Delhi, the team will try to find the winning combination from the beginning
 2012 or 2014 main ipel champion rah chuki shahrukh khan ne team main zyada badlaav nahin kiye hai
 As before, there has been no change in the top order of the team, although there will be three new all-rounders in the team
 kolkata ne colin munro ko 30 lakh, jesan holder ko 7 lakh or jon hestings ko 1

 After marriage this month, daughters go to their maiden in the first spring
 aisa karne ke peeche vajah yah bataai jaati he ki ladkiyaan maansik or shaareerik rup se behatar mahasoos kar saken
 Daughter's maiden is a special tradition in Sawan, which discharges the conditions of both the maternal and in-laws of the daughters
 kabhi kabhi aisa hota he ki betiyon kaa bhagya saare ghar ke bhagya ko niyantrit karata he or jaise hi betiyon kii vidaai hoti he ghar kii sthiti karaab ho jaati he
 Even if daughters are not respected at home, even after marriage, the situation can worsen
 sawan ke maheene main jab beti maayke aae to vishesh tarah ke upaay karne se ghar or jivan kii tamaam samasyaayein hal ho sakati hai
 If there is more discord in your house - get a basil plant from your daughter when she comes into the house
 - jitne bhi din aapaki beti ghar main rahe niyamit rup se shaam ko tulsi ke neeche deepak jalaaen
 After this, the daughter prays for the peace and happiness of the house
 agar aap chaah kar bhi makaan nahin bana paa rah hon yaa sampatti nahin kharid paa rahe hon -- beti ke ghar main aane ke baad kisi bhi mangalvaar ko uske haath se gud le len
 On the same day, put that jaggery in an earthen pot and press it into the soil
 - sheeghra hi makaan or sampatti kii ichha puri ho jaayegi
 If the debts are increasing despite everything in the house, then do these remedies when the daughter comes in the spring- do these measures on any Wednesday after the daughter comes home
 - beti ke haath se ek supaari len, supaari main raksha sutara lapeta hua ho
 - Put the betel nut in a yellow cloth at the place of worship
 - aapke karje utarane shuru ho jaayenge
 If there is a problem of money in the house - then take these measures in the morning on any Monday after the daughter comes home
 - beti ko sampurna shringaar main baithaaen,saamne apni patni ke saath swayan baithen
 - Take a little intact and a silver coin in a pink cloth from the daughter's hand
 - gulabi kapadey main us akshat or sikke ko baandhakar apane dhan sthaan par rakh den
 - Touch the daughter's step

 lekin nateeja twitor yugers main garmagarm bahes ke taur par saamne aayaa
 In the painting, Lord Krishna of the dark color can be seen pointing towards the sky
 unke aage balram khadey hai
 Also some men and women are behind them

 Supporting this view, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor shared the picture of Eid's painting with Mubarakabad on Twitter

 com / i5qhc11cmn — White Mughals Fan (@whitemughalsfan) June 17, 2018 When questions started pouring in from many sides, Yadav referred to Dr
 Dipankar Deb, who in 2015 in his book 'muslim Divotes of Krishna' wrote this painting from Eid
 Was quoted by adding
 deb institute of infrastracchar technology research and management (IITRAM) main associat professor hai, saath hi swaghoshit vaishnavi hai
 He has a negligible background in history
 ise bhi padhein- shahrukh khan ke gane par ranbir kaa chhaiyaan-chhaiyaan dance, Viral videoindia today ne apni padtaal se pataa lagaaya ki deb kii kitaab prakashit hone ke baad, shabana azmi jaise kuch or logon ne bhi is tasviir ko uthaaya or id ke saath use joda
 Shabana Azmi tweeted this picture of a similar message last year
 haalanki deb se jab painting ko lekar unke daawey ke bare main poocha gaya to wo iske liye koi pukhta pramaan dene main naakaam rahe
 Deb admitted that he had never seen the original artwork nor did he know where it was
 ise bhi padhein- VIRAL TEST: kya sachmuch rahul gandhi ne khud ko sabase bada bevakoof kaha tha?'painting kaa id se koi sambandh nahin'kala-itihaaskaaron main jane maane naam or padmashri bi en goswami kaa bhi kahana he ki uparokt painting kaa id se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 Goswami was quoted by Dollarimple while deducting the claims of Yadav and Tharoor
 dilachasp ye he ki yadav bhi goswami ko 'miniechar painting main global athurity' maanate hai
 At the same time, they consider him as a scholar who has no political agenda
 'goswami ke mutabik painting main jo choga pahane bujurg dikh rahe hai ve krishna ke paalak pita nand hai
 The most special thing about this dress is that it is tied on the left side, which is a hallmark of its Hindu dress
 vahiin mughal kaal main muslim poshaak ko hamensha dayee bagal ke neeche baandhte the
 Professor Goswami also explained the origin of the above painting
 goswami ke mutabik ye painting 18veen sadi ke uttarardh (1751 se 1800) ke bich bani he
 This painting is a part of a series of paintings made by the descendants of renowned Himachali painter Nainsukh
 pehle is tarah kii paintings kaa sangrah sirf tehri shaskaon ke paas hi hota tha
 But gradually this collection disintegrated
 kai paintings gum ho gai
 Professor Goswami explains that other paintings of the same series based on the theme of Bhagavatpuran are available
 inamen krishna bhagwaan ko samaan pahanaave main dekha ja saktaa he
 When we discovered, we got some paintings of this series
 tasviir ko id se jodne ko lekar kuch bhram prakhyat itihaaskaar harbans mukhiya kaa hawala dene se bhi hua
 On social media, some people cited the chief's approval of his son and senior journalist Sudeep Mukhiya's tweet in which the painting was actually linked to Eid
 india today ne is sambandh main jab harbans mukhiya se sampark kiya to unhone is vivaad main khud ko naa laane ke liye kaha
 Although his son Sudeep clarified that he had tweeted the Eid's message and father's name with this picture, it was like someone had forwarded him
 sudeep ne ye sweekaar kiya ki unhone painting ko lekar pita se pushti nahin kii thi or unka mere twit se kisi tarah kaa judaav nahin he

 i am very sad because i or Yuvraj are not Dhoni's enemies, but i want to tell him that God will avenge what he did
 ’unhone yah bhi kaha, ‘captain hone ke naate dhoni ko apane senior khilaadiyon kaa samarthan karnaa chahie jo asthaayee taur par kharaab form se jujh rahe hai
 i don't know why he didn't want Yuvraj in the team

 At a time when political disturbances have arisen from the book of former media advisor to the Prime Minister, former Coal Secretary PC Parekh put Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in an uncomfortable position by saying that he is leading a government in which his Political authority is low

 bombai hai court ne buudhvaar ko soharabuddin encounter cese main media reporting par lage bain ko hataa diya
 The ban was imposed by the trial court in its order dated 29 November on media reporting
 29 november kii sunwaayee main sibiai is cese ke pehle gavaah ko pesh karne vaali thi, tabhi yah bain lagaaya gaya tha
 9 journalists and the Brihanmumbai Union of Journalists appealed in the Bombay High Court to remove the ban on media reporting
 reporting par bain kii apil soharabuddin encounter cese ke ek aaropee pulicekarmi abdul rahamaan ne kii thi
 The policeman and the lawyer for the other accused also opposed the plea for the journalists to lift the ban
 bombai hai court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan tippanee kii ki (bain lagane faisle main) bachaav paksh aisa koi kanoon bataane main asafal rahaa, jiske tahat nichali court ne yah bain lagaaya tha
 The High Court agreed with the argument of the journalists' counsel that banning media reporting does not come under the jurisdiction of the lower court
 vakeelon kaa kahana tha ki is tarah kaa bain hai court yaa supreme court hi laga sakate hai
 The High Court also recorded that the judge hearing the case had been affected by the sensitivity of the case and banned media reporting due to unwanted apprehension
 hai court ne kaha he ki jabaki adaalat ko yah dekhnaa chahie tha ki is ashanka kii vajah kya thi
 The High Court also said in its order that the accused (of the encounter case) were unable to clearly state what the risk of lawyers, witnesses or the people present in the court was from the reporting
 hai court ne tippanee kii ki logon ko yah jaanane kaa haq he ki adaalaton main kya chal rahaa he
 The court held that the fundamental right of expression provided for in the constitution also includes the rights of the media and through reporting an open trial, the media not only consumes its authority, but also extends it to the public in the larger public interest
 adaalat ne yah tippanee bhi ki he ki agar abhiyojan paksh ko lagata he ki gavaahon kii pahchaan chhipaani he to vah nichali adaalat se is sambandh main aadesh jari karne kii maang kar saktaa he
 However, along with this, the court said that in the fair hearing public interest as well as the interests of the witnesses should be taken care of

 i believe that Indian fast bowling performed brilliantly in the series

 He said that if the Indian opening pair continues to perform poorly, then Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane will have to take on more responsibility to balance the dependency on Virat Kohli
 hasi ne kaha, ‘bharat ke donon salaami ballebaaj achche khilaadi hai lekin ve nahin chal paa rahe hai
 On some occasions this happens when things do not suit you
 'hasi (michael Hussey) se jab poocha gaya ki kya bharat kohli ke pradarshan par bahut adhik nirbhar he to unhone kaha, ‘kohli (virat Kohli) duniya kaa sarvshereshth khilaadi he or isliye bharat un par bharosa kar saktaa he jisamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 If Steve Smith and David Warner were playing for Australia, then they would be highly dependent on them
 'unhone kaha, ‘bharat kii taraf se pujaara ne edilade main shandaar pradarshan kiya tathaa rahane ne tukdon main acha khel dikhaaya
 You always trust your best batsman but being an extra fast bowler in the second Test match, the Indian lower order got lengthened and this upset the batting balance

 tamaam partiyon ke netaa or ummidavaar iske baad amuman apane booth varkar aadi ke saath vot vaale din kii ranneeti banaate hai
 If there is any attempt to ask for votes from any voter or influence them, then there is a provision for action on that party or candidate
 isliye agar kuch ummidavaar aisa karte bhi hai to bahut hi gupachup tareeke se, yahaan tak virdohi dal or unke kaaryakartaaon se bhi najar bachaa kar
 Election Commission rules or guide lines are fixed for the media regarding news reports and publicity
 mote taur par yah ki koi bhi media santhaan yaa news channel prachaar abhiyaan kii samay seemaa khatm ho jane ke baad aisa kuch bhi nahin dikhaaenge jo ekapaksheeya ho
 Apart from the rule of law, it is also the moral responsibility of these media institutions to take care of the balance if they show the report on the last day of the campaign even after 6 pm
 yani sirf kisi ek dal ke prachaar se judi report nahin, balki mukaable main duusari partiyon kii report yaa paksh ko bhi samaanupaat main jagah dekar hi use prasaarit kiya jaae
 This line seems to be broken this time
 kal shaam se kai news channel, jinka naam lenaa uchit nahin hoga, lagaataar ek paksheeya taur par aise kaarykram yaa reports pesh kar rahe hai jisase lagata he ki maanon santulan rakhana na to unki koi jimmedaari he or na hi koi baadhyataa hi
 Questions are being asked about this in villages and villages and cities
 koi channel puraane intervyuu ke tukdon ko jod jod kar to koi uski nai tarah se packaging kar lagaataar ripet kiye ja rahaa he
 Some have even offered long programs from the childhood of a particular leader to reach this point
 un kaaryakramon main vyaktivishesh ke raajnneeti se lekar bhaavnaatmak pahalu tak ko is tarah se darshaya gaya he, maanon us shaks ko nattejey ke pehle hi vijayi bataaya ja rahaa ho
 Some programs have been seen that are shown after the success of becoming CM or PM
 beshak chunaav purv kaa akalan kuch bhi kahata ho, kisi bhi party ko kitni bhi seat milane kaa purvanumaan ho, kisi kii haar yaa kisi kii jeet ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hon, matdaan se 48 ghante pehle kii pabandi vaale vakt main ekapaksheeya taur par aise program dikhaanaa votaron ko prabhavit karne kii shrenee main aata he
 For this reason, the exit poll is also banned till the end of the last round of voting
 12 may ko aakhri daur kaa matdaan hona he
 Polling is to be held in 41 seats, which is a large number in itself
 aise main kisi vyakti vishesh ko kendrit kar mahimamandan karne vaale yaa kam se kam aisa abhas dene vaale kaarykram sidhe taur par us vyakti or uski party ke prachaar sareekhe lagate hai
 Personally, i think so
 jin media santhaan yaa channelon ne is tarah ke program yaa reports dikhaae hai yaa dikhaa rahe hai, jaahir he yaa to unhen chunaav ayog kii parvaah nahin, peshewar naitikta kaa khyaal nahin yaa phir gambhir kism kii laaparvaahee he
 With an experienced editorial team, it cannot be assumed that all this is happening inadvertently
 yahaan ye saaf karnaa jaruri he ki aise program yaa report ke peeche main kisi bhi santhaan par paisa lene yaa bikaoo hone kaa akshep nahin laga rahaa hum
 Rather, i am trying to keep my point from my perspective
 aakhir jis loktantr media kii mahati bhoomika ho or use abhivyakti kii aazaadee ho, aise main usamen self regulation kaa bhav bhi gaharaa hona chahie
