 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee gave a dramatic twist to the spying of spying relatives of freedom fighter Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
 unki sarkaar ne intelligence branch (ibi) kii 64 filon ko gopneeyata ke parade se mukt kar diya
 With this came the rule of the government, which was imprisoned in the 12,744 pages which had been closed and yellow for decades in the vault of IB headquarters on Kolkata's Lord Sinha Road
 in filon ne us report kii tasdik kar di, jo is saal 10 april ko sabase pehle india today ne rashtriya abhilekhaagaar main rakhe or saarvajanik kiye gaye ati gopneey dastavejon ke aadhaar par chhaapi thiah jawaharlal nehru sarkaar kii ibi ne do dashakon se zyada vakt tak netaji ke najdiki parijanon kii gahan jasusi kii thi
 The latest treasure trove of documents made public reveals how tremendous this espionage was, on which the IB would undoubtedly have to spend a lot of its resources
 asal main netaji ke vishaal parivaar ke ve sabhi sadsy nigaraanee main the, jo 1, woodburn park or 38 / 2 elgin road par rahete the
 These included Netaji's brother Sharatchandra Bose and his two sons Amiya Nath Bose and Shishir Kumar Bose, his sisters Chitra Ghosh and Roma Roy, and Netaji's wife Emily Schenkle, living in Austria
 netaji ke pote chandrakumar bose naaraazgi se kehete hai, “duniya main kisi bhi duusari jagah ek swatantraaa senaanee kii uske apane hi desh ne itani jabardast jasusi nahin kii hogi
 According to Chandrakumar, there are clear indications in these files that Netaji was still alive for a long time after his disappearance on August 18, 1945
 file nan
 58 contains a CID report of March 1948 in which American and British intelligence agencies claimed Netaji to be alive
 file nan
 22 mentions a police diary of 1948 in which Netaji's aide Devnath Das states that Netaji is in Manchuria

 The opinion of the Third Justice Mukherjee Commission formed in 2006 was rejected by the Central Government
 netaji kii gumshudagi se rahasy kii paraten hataane kii khatir ek andolan khadaa hua jisane saikadon “netaji files” ko saarvajanik karne kii maang kii
 The reasons for this have not yet been fully explained why the letters of the Bose family, which came through the Elgin Road Post Office, were opened in the middle, pictures of their funerals were taken and they were kept in files

 At the state police museum where these original documents have been kept in glass boxes for display, Mamta told the media, "these documents prove that the Bose family was spied
 main bas itnaa hi kahuungi ki yah durbhagyapurna tha
 “not all of the 64 files that the West Bengal government has made public are related to the Bose family

 a letter written in the name of Sharat Chandra Bose from Vienna by Subhash Bose's wife Emily Shenkel was opened midway in 1946
 shenkal ne likhaa tha ki netaji or unki shaadi 1942 main hindu reeti-rivaajon se hui thi, lekin german nagarikon ke videshiyon ke saath shaadi karne ke khilaaf prachlit roak-tok or varjanaaon kii vajah se ise register nahin karavaaya ja sakaa
 In one of the revelations that Ib must have blossomed, he mentioned the shock of hearing the news of Netaji's death
 is chitthee ko bich main kholane or padhgaye vaale afasar ne apni report main likhaa, “is chitthee ko likhane ke lahaze or tareeke se yah sachhee maaloom hoti he
 "shekhar Krishnan, a historian and archivist based in Mumbai, says," It is quite clear that the espionage machinery of the British era against INA and the Bose family was never stopped
 aazaadee ke baad bhi isane apana kaam jas kaa tas jari rakhaa
 a spate of documents made public revealed a letter from the Special Branch, revealing a government order issued after independence, in which the letters sent from the Bose family's houses for the first time were given the right to open and read in the middle
 Gone: Order No

 kamaal kii baat to yah he ki yah dur-dur tak faili jasusi aazaadee ke baad bhi dashakon tak chhipi rahi
 And now it has come out that successive governments were constantly refusing to remove the veil of secrecy from these documents held by the Center and the state
 bijepi ne vipaksh main rahete hue netaji se judi filon ko baahar laane kaa vaada kiya, magar ab vah is vaade se peeche hat rahi he
 In December 2014, Minister of State for Home Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary said in response to a question by Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy that "making these files public" is not desirable from the perspective of India's relations with foreign nations
 ” isi daleel kaa sahaara pichley ek dashak se ek ke baad ek sarkarein leti rahi hai
 On September 11, the Chief Minister of West Bengal suddenly announced to make the files related to Netaji public, and his cautious move gave new life to the deadline debate of bringing all such files out of secrecy
 isane endie ke upar jabardast dabaav aayad kar diya he ki vah centre ke kabje main rakhi 150 se zyada netaji filon se ati gopneey kaa thappa hataae
 Sukhendu Shekhar Roy says, "it is unfortunate that successive governments of West Bengal have kept suppressing such serious material for years
 masalan, ham nahin jaanate ki kitne iljaamiya kagajaat nasht kiye ja chuke hai
 "he says," Now it is also necessary for the central government to follow in Mamta's footsteps

 They have met these relatives twice before and have promised to look into the matter of securing the files related to Netaji, but the government has not taken any step in this direction yet
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne 21 sitambar ko kaha ki in dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kaa faisla “jaldi hi” liya jayega
 Chandra Kumar Bose, a spokesman for the Bose family, is currently preparing an agenda for a meeting with the Prime Minister, in which three important demands will be laid: The central government should make all the Netaji files it holds public

 It revealed that less sleep has a negative effect on the molecular system and also targets cofilin
 ram rahim ke bade raajadaar pawan insaan kii giraftaar punjab ke mohali ke laldu se hui he
 Earlier on 3 October, Ram Rahim's favorite honeypreet was also arrested from Zirakpur in Mohali
 is tarah panchakula hinsa ke baad faraar dere ke most wanted punjab ke mohali se giraftaar hue hai

 After all, under whose protection he remained hidden for 85 days

 Sukhdeep Kaur helped her in this entire matter

 The film 'running Shaadi' is also on a similar topic in which a young man named Ram Bharosa opens a website through which young couples contact Ram Bharosa and Ram Bharosa from the home of those young couples Runs and gets married
 ram bharose kii bhoomika main hai amit saadh or film main ghar se in jodon ko bhagane main unka saath detii he nimmi or unke dost sibar
 Nimmi is played by Taapsee Pannu
 yani ye running shaadi naam kii website aise yuvaaon kii bhaga kar shaadi karwaati he jinke parivaar vaale unki shaadi ke khilaaf hote hai
 The subject of this film is quite interesting and the film does not even slide
 film kaa doosraa bhaag khaas taur se rochak he jab kahani punjab se patna pahunchati he
 The characters, their gestures and accents seem quite realistic
 film main kai jagahon par humar kaa acha istemaal kiya gaya he
 The three main characters Taapsee Pannu, Amit Sadh and Arsh Bajwa have good performances
 tippaniyan Talking about the shortcomings of this film, the biggest problem is that the story of the film is as attractive as its story has not become as attractive
 jitne achche se film kii shruwaat hoti he utane achche se iskaa ant nahin hota kyonki ek samay ke baad ham vahi dekh rahe hote hai ki ek ladki apane parivaar ke dar se ek ladke ke saath bhaag rahi he
 The name of this film was previously 'running Shaadi
com' but due to some legal confusion, the name of the film had to be removed
 is vajah se jahaan bhi dot com shabd aata vahaan awaz dabaa di gai he, jo puri film main bahut hi atapata lagata he
 However, we cannot blame the filmmaker in this
 ek nae vishay par bani film 'running shaadi' bahut zyada manoranjan to nahin karti magar bor bhi nahin hone detii isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 2
 5 stars is film kaa vishay kaaphi dilachasp he or film kahin slo bhi nahin hoti he
 The second part of the film is particularly interesting when the story reaches Patna from Punjab
 kirdaar, unke haav bhav or lahaze kaaphi realistic lagate hai
 Humor has been used well in many places in the film
 teenon mukhya kirdaar taapasi pannu, amit saadh or arsh bajva kaa abhinay acha he
 The comments is film kii kamiyon kii baat karen to sabase badi problem yah he ki film kaa vishay jitna aakarshak he isaki kahani utani aakarshak nahin ban pai he
 The better the film starts, the better it does not end because after a while we see that a girl is running away with a boy for fear of her family
 is film kaa naam pehle 'running shaadi dot com' tha magar kisi kanoonee uljhan kii vajah se film ke naam se dot com hataanaa padaa
 Because of this, wherever the word dot com comes, the voice has been suppressed, which seems very strange throughout the film
 haalanki isamen ham filmkaar ko dosha nahin de sakate
 The film 'running Shaadi', which is based on a new topic, does not entertain a lot but also does not allow boredom, so my rating for this film is 2
 5 stars

 Conference on Army Strategies and Future Needs Military Integration Will Co-ordinate Between the Three Armies a Conference of the Top Commanders of the Three Services was held to strengthen the Army's strategies and future needs, including the needs of Army Integration and a Joint Services Act
 is discussed
 haal hi main centre sarkaar ne teenon senaaon ke liye ek chif of dephence staff kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Keeping this in mind, a joint military law was called for which would facilitate coordination in the armed forces
 kyon he sanyukt seva adhinium kii jarurat?sutron ne kaha ki nausena, thal sena or vaayu sena- teenon kii jaruraton ke liye ek sanyukt seva adhinium kii jarurat he jo sainya ekikaran ke saath teenon senaaon ke bich talmail ko majboot karegaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Independence Day on 15 August this year that a Chief of Defense Staff would be appointed for the three armies
 sanyukt seva adhinium ke rup main ek sanyukt kanoonsena ke prabhavi ekikarnaur teenon sainya sanrachanaon ke bich samanvay ke liye mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 An official said, 'the discussion on the need for a Joint Services Act has started in this meeting
 philhal teenon senaaon ke liye sansad se alag alag adhinium paarit hai
 Now the approval of the government on the Joint Services Act will accelerate the integration of armies
 'prashikshan ke ekikaran par bhi charcharashtriya suraksha salaahkaar aji t dobhaal ke netritv main ek cameti chif of dephence staff ke is masale par vichaar kar rahi he ki teenon senaaon ke pramukh ke offis kaa swaroop kaisaa ho, isaki jimmedaariyaan or adhikaar kya hon jisase yah sarkaar or teenon ke bich ek salaahkaar sanstha ke rup main kaam kar sake
 Integration of training between officers of the three armies was also discussed as it is an essential aspect of military forces
 adhikari ne bataaya, 'sainya cmanderon ke sammelan main yuddh ke badalte swaroop ke saath antariksh, kritrim budhimatta, apgraded prashikshan jaise vibhinn pahaluon ke mahatv or inhen jald se jald apnaane ko lekar vistaar se charchaa hui
 'reconstruction of Army Headquarters is currently in process, it was also discussed as some approvals have been approved by the government
 adhikari ne kaha, 'nirnay liya gaya he ki lambit prastaavon ko puri tarah sarkaar kii manjuuri milane par punargathan kii prakriya samagrata main shuru ho jaaegi
 ' bollywood abhinetri manisha koirala ne kaha ki jo yah prakope kerala par aayaa he
 People of Kerala maintain their morale

 Let us know that the total number of deaths in Kerala has increased to 445
 inamen se 293 log 8 agast se ab tak maare gaye hai
 Many people are still missing and 6 lakh people are living in relief camps
 bataa den kikerala main marane waalon kii kul sankhya 445 ho gai he

 If the Congress feels that it has won on the promise of farm loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh, then why this charisma did not happen in Rajasthan, where this February Rs 8,500 crore
 karj maaf karne kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 If the Congress won the debt waiver promise in Chhattisgarh, why did the BJP not get a majority in Karnataka
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa sarkaar ne karj maafee kii thi phir bhi logon ko bharosa nahin hua
 In Karnataka, the Congress gave Rs 8,500 crore to cooperative banks in 2017
 ke karj maaf kiye the
 But the people of the state did not completely fall on the debt waiver promise of JD (S)
 bas ek badi chunavi haar yaa kismat se mili ek jeet ke asar se raajnneeti badahavaas ho jaati he
 1,72,146 crore in seven states (punjab and maharashtra-june 2017, Uttar pradesh-april 2017, rajasthan-february 2018, karnataka-july 2018, Chhattisgarh and Madhya pradesh-december 2018) from December last year in the country
 kisaan karj maaf karne kaa elaan hua
 Did these change the outcome of the elections? Did the BJP and Congress governments have their debt waivers in later elections? Farmers' debts have become an all-party gospel of Indian politics
 karj maafee jaruratmand kisaanon tak nahin pahunchati, ise jaanane ke liye vaigyanik hone kii jarurat nahin he lekin isse vittiya tantra main ban rahe dushchakr bataate hai ki siyasat kis had tak gaiyr-jimmedaar ho chali he
 • After the farm loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, most of the agro-based states are now in the grip of this competition
 bihar, bengal or kuch anya rajyon main ise doharaaya jayega
 The debt waiver of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is going to be painful for the banks and the government
 bakaul rigerv bank, madhya pradesh main kul bank karj main kheti ke liye milane vaale karj kaa hissaa 29 fisadi or rajasthan main 35 fisadi he
 Which is much higher than other states
 madhya pradesh main kheti main fanse hue karj 11 fisadi hai
 This level is much higher than the national average
 • lone maafee par dastakhat karte hue madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ne yah bhi nahin bataaya ki 35,000 karod ru
 Who will pay this bill? Farm loans account for 15 percent of Karnataka's total bank debt
 inaki maafee kaa aadha boj bainkon or aadha rajya ke bajet par hoga
 This formula has not yet been formulated, so there is a delay in implementing the debt waiver
 • uttar pradesh (36,359 karod ru
 ) And Maharashtra (34,022 crore)
 ) ne puri karj maafee bajet par le lee
 Maharashtra had to take a loan from Shirdi temple to run the expenditure and Uttar Pradesh had to cut its capital expenditure (construction and development) by 33 per cent
 karj maafee karne vaale sabhi rajyon kii reating giri he yani unhen mahange karj lene honge
 • Due to repeated debt waiver, government banks are reluctant to give loans to farmers
 krishi karj main state bank kaa hissaa kaaphi teji se gira he jabaki nijee bank zyada bada hissaa le rahe hai, jinase karj maaf karana mushkil he
 Microfinance companies in Karnataka suffered severe injuries after demonetisation and loan waiver
 • kya hamaare rajaneta jaananaa chahenge ki bharat ke bank kheti ko chune se darane lage hai? 2007 se 2017 ke bich kheti ko karj kii vruddhi dar 33 fisadi se ghatakar 8
 Came down to 2 percent
 andhra pradesh, telugana or tamilnadu main pichley teen saal main karj maafee ke baad kheti ko karj kii aapurti buree tarah giri he
 It has moved beyond debt waiver to electricity bill waiver
 kal home lone maaf karne kii bhi raajnneeti hogi
 Ultimately, we are moving to the point where either farmers will find it difficult to get loans or after tax waiver, every kind of tax will increase or development will shrink
 agar bharat ke rajya koi company hote jo kamalnath, vasundhara raaje yaa yogi adityanath ke apane paise se bani hoti to kya asar or phaayde jane bagaiyr ve karj maafee ke daanv lagaate rahete? yah puraa drama karadaataaon yaa jamakartaon ke paise par hota he or hamen paise udaakar phir baar-baar chalaa jaataa he
 Debt is being forgiven, now be ready to pay the price

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has backed the controversial statement of BJP MP from Unnao Sakshi Maharaj
 party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main unhone likhaa he ki madrase jihadi taiyaar karne ke kaarkaane ban gaye hai or yah koi aisi tippanee nahin he jis par bavaal machana chahie
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav has written that there is nothing controversial in the statement of Sakshi Maharaj and it should not create a 'panic'
 unhone likhaa ki madrason ke sambandh main kai baar aise saboot saamne aa chuke hai
 He questioned the contribution of madrasas in building nationality
 unhone likhaa, 'madrason main mathrubhumi ke liye prem pradarshit karne vaale koun se geet gaae jate hai, iskaa khulaasa mullah maulavee karen
 In this' poisonous' editorial, it is written, 'the work of despair in the head and ammo in matsar (jealousy) is being done in madrasas
 kai madrason main hathiyaar or gola-barood mili hai
 Pakistani citizens have been arrested from some madrasas
 'shivasena pramukh ne likhaa he ki sakshi maharaj kaa bayaan desh kaa ek katu satya he or isse samaaj main foot padane kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 He wrote, 'A generation of Muslims went into ignorance and darkness due to the madrassas, what if it is not unfortunate
 ' Today, while writing about farmers, a recently published news is coming to mind, which could not make its place in the headlines
 desh kaa lagbhag aadha hissaa abhi sookhe kii chapet main he
 In a country where millions of farmers have committed suicide in the last few decades, this news got the attention of many people
 
 
 ? jo desh 'jai jawan, jai kisaan' jaisaa naaraa lagaataa he, vahaan kisaanon ko lekar sarkaar yaa samaaj main aaj waisi bechaini kyon nahin dikhti, jaisi dikhni chahie
 
 
 The Under the crop insurance scheme, companies benefit from thousands of crores of rupees a year and thousands of farmers commit suicide every year
 aisa kyon
 
 
 The With this question, progressive organizations have taken to the streets again and again and will continue to descend further, as long as the issues of farmers and other deprived sections remain ignored
 kya kisaanon kii samasyaayein unka karz maaf karne se yaa unhen saal main 6,000 rupee dene se dur ho jaaengi
 
 
 The The government has to understand that when the need is for open-heart surgery, it cannot be treated by giving band-aid
 asli masalaa to kheti ko bachaane kaa he, aisa hua, to kisaan khud-ba-khud batch jaaenge
 In the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana, the peasant family has been insulted by giving them about six and a half rupees a day
 lekin is sach par paradaa daalate hue pradhanmantri kisaan yojana ke bare main ek hindi akhbaar ne likhaa tha, "kisaan hue maalamaal
 
 
 "when there is such a hollow understanding in one part of the media about such an important issue of the country, then imagine how difficult the farmers would be able to convey their words to the people
 mukhyadhara ke media se kisaanon ke mudde gaayab hai or jab kabhi apwaad ke taur par baat hoti he, to usamen bhi kisaanon ko na bulaakar aise logon ko bulaayaa jaataa he, jinhen kheti-kisaani kii samaj hi nahin hoti
 We should find the answer to the question how agriculture can be made profitable
 kisaanon ko fasal kii sahi keemat dene kaa dhindhora peetane vaali sarkaar ne aaj tak laagat mulya main sabhi kharchon ko jodne kii zarurat nahin samajhi
 By changing the definition of cost, the Modi government has done a lot of dishonesty with farmers
 yahi nahin, nunatam samarthan mulya ke daayre main na sabziyaan aati hai, na fal or na hi nakadi fasalen
 The promise of implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission Report was also a jumla
 shanta kumaar cameti kii 2015 kii report ke anusaar keval chah fisadi kisaan apni fasal sarkari dar par bech pate hai
 In the country where Santoshi dies saying 'bhat-bhat', there is rot in government grain godowns
 bhartiya khaadya nigam (FCI) main anaaj kii kareed, bhandaaran, dhulaai or vitaran ke kaamon kaa dhang se bantwaaraa hona chahie
 Until the basic facilities are made better, farmers will have to depend on middlemen for cold storage, transportation etc
 karzmaafi ko hi kisaanon kii sabhi samasyaon ko dur karne kaa tarika maananaa thik nahin he
 It is important to pay attention to other things also
 masalan, kisaanon kii jot lagaataar choti hoti ja rahi he, jisase unka munaafaa bahut kam ho gaya he
 The average holding in 2011 was only one and a half hectare, which is lower than the earlier figures
 isi saal ke jansankhya aankadon ke anusaar desh ke lagbhag 85 pratishat kisaanon ke paas do hectare se kam zamin he
 If cooperative farming is encouraged, the cost of farming on everything from seeds to irrigation will be reduced and this will benefit the farmers
 ek samasya karz kii oonchi byaaj dar kii bhi he
 The Swaminathan Commission report said a four percent rate, which needs to be further reduced as well as eliminate the dependence of the farmer on middlemen
 vigyaan kii madad lekar kitnashkon se lekar sinchai vyavastha jaisi chizon ko behatar banane ke saath-saath jaivik krishi ko badhaava dene kii zarurat he, lekin pichley paanch saal se desh kii sarkaar vigyaan kii jagah vigyapanon par taxpere kaa paisa kharch kar rahi he
 According to the survey of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, i
e
 NABARD, today only 12
 7 fisadi khetihar pariwaron kii puri aamadani kheti se hoti he
 The rest of the farmers either have to work in the village or they have to move to the cities, where they are sometimes forced to sleep on the pavement, sometimes they have to work for very little wages
 unki maut kisaanon se jude kisi sarkari aankade main darj nahin hoti
 Here i am not talking about the millions of farmers who have committed suicide in recent decades
 jo kisaan shaharon main rozi-roti ke sangharsh main benaam maut mar rahe hai, unki baat kab hogi
 
 
 The While the government should make good policies and implement them, it is not getting free time just by promoting them by making wrong policies
 aaj sabhi nagarikon, khaaskar yuvaaon ko aise masalon par khulkar apni baat rakhni chahie
 If they divert attention from such important issues and close the political shops of those who debate on fake issues, then this will definitely change the picture of the lives of the farmers
 aaj jati-aadhaarit ugr andolanon kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki jo jatiyaan mukhya rup se kheti-kisaani par nirbhar rahi hai, unhen aaj rozi-roti ke liye koi doosraa vikalp nahin dikh rahaa
 Why does the son of the farmer not want to become a farmer today
 
 
 ? agar ham kheti-kisaani kii samasyaon ko thik se samajhnaa chaahate hai, to hamen is sawaal kaa jawaab dhundhane kii koshish kerani chahie
 Today the youth will have to think that when the farmers of the country are dying in the fields, their responsibilities will not be fulfilled just by putting a tricolor picture on Facebook
 unhen kisaanon ke dukh-dard ko samajhate hue unke saath apni awaz buland kerani hogi

 He said, 'shankaracharya is promoting extremism by asking Naga Sadhus to gather in Haridwar and Prayag
 'is bich varanasi main swarupanand ne ek baar phir doharaaya ki hindu sai ko devtaa naa maane
 The disciples of Swaroopananda performed the aarti of Shankaracharya and took an oath that they would remove the idol of Sai from the temples

 Superstar Salman Khan's film has been released at the India box office
 relies se thik pehle film vivaadon main aa gai thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki ise relies nahin kiya ja sakegaa

 vikaas kaa aarope tha ki film kaa naam bharat he or yah samvidhan kii dhara 3 kaa ulanghan karti he
 Article 3 of the Constitution says that the word Bharat and any symbol related to it cannot be used commercially

 Tyagi had urged the Delhi High Court to direct the producer and director of the film to change the title of the film
 bataa den ki yah pehla maamla nahin he ki jab bharat shabd kaa istemaal kisi commercial uddeshy ke liye kiya gaya ho
 Even before this, the word Bharat has been used many times for earning, although then it did not create any major controversy

 Indeed, Nehru has become a challenge for the Prime Minister
 unhone khud nehru ko chunauti maan liya he
 He continues to disarm Nehru
 unke samarthakon kii sena whotsap naam kii juthi uniwarsity main nehru ko lekar lagaataar jhooth failaa rahi he
 In front of Nehru, a Nehru fabricated with lies is being erected
 ab ladaai modi or nehru kii nahin rah gai he
 Now the battle has taken place between the real Nehru and the fabricated Nehru
 aap jaanate hai,is ladaai main jeet asli nehru kii hogi
 While fighting with Nehru, the ghost of Nehru arose around Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 nehru kaa apana itihaas he
 He will not end by burning books and demolishing the Teen Murti Bhavan
 yah galati khud modi kar rahe hai
 While doing nehru-nehru, he is raising Nehru all around
 modi ke aas-paas ab nehru dikhaai dene lage hai
 His supporters will also become Nehru's experts in some days, not Modi's
 bhale hi unke paas jhooth se gadha gaya nehru hoga,magar hoga to nehru hi
 Listening to the Prime Minister's election speeches, it seems that Nehru's contribution is that he sometimes insulted Bose, sometimes Patel and sometimes Bhagat Singh
 vah azaadi kii ladaai main nahin the,vah kuch netaaon ko apamaanit karne ke liye lard rahe the
 Did Nehru spend nine years in the prisons of British rule insulting these people
 
 
 ?in netaaon ke bich vaicharik duuri,antarvirodh or alag-alag raste par chalane kii dhun ko ham kab tak apmaan ke frem main dekhenge
 According to this, at that time everyone was insulting each other
 rashtriya andolan kii yahi khubi thi ki alag-alag vichaaron vaale ek se ek kaddavar netaa the
 This was Gandhi's quality
 unke banaae daur kii thi,jiske kaaran congress or congress se baahar netaaon se bharaa akaash dikhaai detaa tha
 Gandhi was also given this opportunity by the leaders and social reformers before him
 modi ke hi shabdon main yah bhagat singh kaa bhi apmaan he ki unki sari qurbaani ko nehru ke liye rache gaye ek jhooth se joda ja rahaa he
 What the Prime Minister has said wrongly about Bhagat Singh and Nehru is not a lie, but a lie
 nehru or field marshall kariyappa,general thimayya ko lekar jo galat bolaa he,vah bhi jhooth tha
 Many people live in the misconception that the Prime Minister's research team is at fault
 aap gaur se unke bayanon ko dekhie
 When you look at the entire statement with one word, a design will appear in it
 bhagat singh vaale bayaan main hi sabase pehle vah khud ko alag karte hai
 It is said that he is not aware of the history and then in the next sentences confidently talks about the questions saying that no Congress leader went to meet Bhagat Singh while he was in jail
 agar aap gujarat chunaavon main manishankar ayyar ke ghar hui baithak par unke bayaan ko isi tarah dekhenge,to ek dizine nazar aayega
 The designer of the statements will be aware that the general public knows history not by books but by some rumors
 bhagat singh ke bare main yah afvaah jansulabh he ki us vakt ke netaaon ne unhen faansee se bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Nehru was made suspicious on the basis of this popular public rumor and based on it
 naam liye bina kaha gaya ki nehru bhagat singh se nahin milane gaye
 This is such a simple fact that there cannot be any mistake with any research team in this
 taarikh yaa saal main chook ho sakati thi,magar puraa prasang hi galat ho,yah ek pattern bataata he
 It is another matter that Bhagat Singh was strongly opposed to communalism and did not believe in God
 sampradayikta ke sawaal par naastik hokar jitne bhagat singh spasht hai,utane hi nehru bhi hai
 Rather both look closer
 nehru or bhagat singh ek duusare kaa sammaan karte the
 If there is opposition too, will it be accounted for in the election rallies

 Sharad Yadav, the national president of Janata Dal United (JDU), reached Patna on Wednesday amidst continuous efforts for change of power in Bihar
 haalanki unki patna yatra kii vajah party kii baithak main bhaag lenaa he, lekin jaankaron kii maane to sharad or nitish kumaar bihar ke maujuuda mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ke kaamkaaj se prasann nahin hai or unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 But on reaching Patna, the party president said that at present there is no such effort that Chief Minister Manjhi should be removed and Nitish Kumar should be made Chief Minister again
 jaankaron ke mutabik, sharad yadav kii koshish he ki maanjhi ko samajha-bujhaakar unase istipha liya jaae, isiilie unhone maanjhi-virdohi mantriyon ko bhi philhal unke khilaaf koi bayaan nahin dene ke nirdesh die hai
 Meanwhile, when Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad Yadav's campaign to make Nitish Kumar the chief minister was questioned, he retorted, where did the news come from? 
 
 ? unhone kaha, philhal main hi mukhyamantri hum, or mujhe is tarah kii koi baat sunne ko nahin mili he
 Manjhi clearly said that their leader is Nitish Kumar and if Nitish will speak anything in this regard, then he should be questioned about it
 jaankaron kii maane to maanjhi kaa janaa tay he, lekin yah kab or kaise hoga, koi nahin jaanata
 Meanwhile, the BJP has requested Jitan Ram Manjhi to dissolve the assembly and hold fresh elections
 6 may yani somvaar ko loksabhaa chunaav (election 2019)kepanchave charan kaa matdaan hona he
 The biggest challenge before the opposition in this entire election is how to prevent the votes against the BJP from being shattered
 chunaav kii ghoshnaa se pehle congress ne vipakshi ekta kii badi koshish kin or sabhi dalon ko upie main laane kii koshish bhi kii
 But this could not happen
 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa or areldi milakar alag chunaav lard rahe hai to pashchim bengal main bhi tiemasi netaa mamata banerjee ne bhi congress ko bhav nahin diya
 TDP also did not listen to Congress in Andhra Pradesh
 haalanki bihar main congress argedy ne kai chote dalon ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 But BJP + JDU + ljp's vote bank is overshadowing this grand alliance
 baat karen un siton kii jahaan agar congress or anya vipakshi dal saath milakar ladate to bijepi ke liye badi mushkil ho jaati
 Now Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi is clarifying that Uttar Pradesh is not her party's 'votkatwa' and she can never think of bjp's help

 And i would always feel short of words because i knew i would not know a patch of what he did about my industry but still he had this great quality to make everyone he spoke to, feel important to his time
 He is indeed a huge loss to the nation
 But his loss to our family is deeper
 a void never to be filled
 i have grown up around him and buji, played innumerable times with Sonali and Rohan, in his office when he was a lawyer
 i remember him as someone always working hard, dedicated and so focused
 His knowledge and sharp insight about everything was tremendous and indepth
 He loved the company of children and the youth and always wanted to hear how our lives were going and how we saw our future
 It used to be mesmerizing to sit in the same room as him and hear him talk as he would have everyone engaged and in splits with his anecdotes and stories one after another from his incredible life
 He exemplified high standard of ethics, ideologies and value system which i have seen and try to imbibe in my work and life
 i will always remember him with a warm prayer, immense gratitude and love
 i truly believe legends live on forever and he truly will
 My heart is always with you buji, Sonali and Rohan

 Books like this in Hindi are isolated and those that are, have become one-sided as academics
 lekin yah inase alahada he
 This book has been written in a new way, in which the content of the television teaser is indicated in the beginning of every chapter in a systematic manner

 film kaa naam: purnadiarector: rahul boguster cast: rahul bose, aditi inaamdaar, minaa gupta, priya, aananvvadhi: 1 ghanta 45 minutesrtificate: uretimga: 3
 5 Star Today is a biopic trend
 koi cricketer kii bana rahaa he to koi filmkaaron kii to koi kaviyon kii jeevani ko rupahale parade par darshane kii koshish main vyast he
 Actor director and producer Rahul Bose has tried something similar
 rahul ne 25 may 2014 ko mount everest par chadhaai karne vaali sabase choti umr kii bhartiya ladki 'purna malavat' kii jindagi par aadhaarit yah film 'purna' banaai he
 Movie Review: The strong dose of action is 'naam Shabana'
 This story is about Poorna Malawat (aditi Inamdar), a girl from a small village in Telangana and the school fees due to poor economic conditions in her house
 Can not even give
 purna apane chachaa kii beti priya ke saath skool jaaya karti he or phir ek din priya ke kehane par sarkari skool se bhaagane kii koshish bhi karti he kyonki sarkari skool main khaane-pine ke liye kai chijen free milti thi
 Then, after Priya gets married at a young age, Purna's father enrolls her in a government school
 skool main nirikshan karne aaye adhikari praveen kumaar (rahul bose) ko jab pataa chalata he ki sahi dhang se khaanaa naa milane ke kaaran purna skool chhodkar bhaag gai he to wo sabaki class lete hai
 Coach Purna is brought back and when Purna goes on a mountain climbing trip with the school children, the coaches are happy to see her attitude
 dhire-dhire wo parvatarohan seekhney lagati he or uskaa naam mount averest par chadhaai ke liye de diya jaataa he
 On 25 May 2014, Poorna becomes the youngest girl to climb Everest
 Film Reveiw: dilachasp kahani, par bor karti he fillorikyon dekh sakate hai- film main aapako har tarah ke imoshan milte hai, chaahe wo jazbe ke saath aage badhane kaa ho yaa phir kabhi ummid tuutate hue nam ankhon kaa
 Aditi Inamdar, who plays the title role, has given excellent performances, while Rahul Bose's work with the rest of the co-stars is also comfortable
 - film kaa screenple or cinemetography bhi sateek he jisaki vajah se tehraav bana rahata he or aap bhi film ke saath conect kar pate hai
 - The songs of the film are amazing which go along with the story and the background score is also good
 - film main 'purna' kii kahani ke saath-saath sarkari skool main khaane ke vitaran ke saath saath bal vivaah jaise muddon kii taraf bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he
 - The last 15 minutes of the film are very special and one can hear the applause in the theater
 19 hajaar foot par purna ne jari kiya unki byopic kaa first lukkamjor kadiyanika dukka baton ko nazarandaaj kar den to kuch bhi aisa nahin tha jo film main aapako niraash kare
 The budget of the box office film is low because Rahul Bose had kept the costing Correct at the production level, due to which it would have been easy for the makers to remove the cost of digital and music rights as well as marketing and promotion

 The leader of the poster preparing team, Ashok Chaurasia said, 'if Modi ji has accepted the truth related to his marriage then what is wrong with it?'
 unhone desh kii seva ke liye ghar or parivaar chhod diya
 Now the people of the country have to decide whether that country is with lovers or with wife and lovers

 poster main kendriya mantri shashi tharur kii patni sunanda pushkar kii sandigdh paristhitiyon main hui maut kaa bhi zikr he
 At the same time, Congress supporters have put full emphasis on the modi-jashodaben episode in the entire district
 congress ke kshetreey mahasachiv devendra singh ne kaha ki modi ko sabhi log sahi bataa rahe hai lekin jashodaben ke saath jo hua kya wo uchit he? isse modi ke charitra ke bare main pataa chalata he
 How can a person hide such a big truth about his life
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main ek kanoonee pench bhi he
 In the election affidavit, Modi has not given any information about his wife's property

 input: bhashaa Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui faced many challenges due to his complexion
 apane rang or fijic ke chalate unhen industry main kaam milane main baari dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha is bare main to zyaadaatar log jaanate hai
 But do you know that this apartheid happening to him was with him from the beginning
 is had tak ki unhen apane hi khandaan main ise phase karnaa padaa tha
 During an interview with Nilesh Mishra in an interview with Village Connection, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said that when people leave from NSD, it seems that they will get work as soon as they go to Mumbai
 lekin jab vahaan jaakar shuru main thapede khaae
 
 
 At this Nilesh asked Nawazuddin what were the problems? On this Nawazuddin told, "it all started with me from the village itself
 meri personality ko bahut underestimet kiya gaya tha
 "he used to go to office"
 khadey rahete the assistant ke saamne
 He used to see me from bottom to top
 wo poochta tha 'kya he?' main bolta tha- actor hai
 He used to say that by appearing he does not seem to be an actor
 is par navazuddin unase kuch karke dikhaane ko kehete the
 He used to say that he remembers some of the speeches he can hear
 yaa phir jo kuch wo kahen wo bhi kar sakate hai
 Nawazuddin used to say that we have come prepared
 baaki aap dekh lo
 On this, he used to get the answer that man is not that material
 navazuddin is par assistant se kaha karte the ki material kya hota he us par bhi kaam kar lenge
 Tell me a little ye sab kaaphi vakt tak chalaa
 Nawazuddin said that he used to buy fair-and-lovely type creams from shops and apply them
 navazuddin ne apane parivaar kii dastaan bhi sunai
 He said, "in our family, all are 6–6 feet tall and white
 bas hamaare mata-pita saanwale or choti hit ke the
 We became the same
 baaki sabhi hamaare khandaan main lambey chaude or gore chittey hai
 "nawazuddin Siddiqui said that those people never accepted us
 khel vahiin se shuru ho gaya tha
 There was a shock in this heart
 bataa den ki navazuddin siddiki jald hi apni charchit web siries secred games ke duusare sijan main kaam karte najar aaenge
 The promo video of the series has arrived and now the fans are waiting for the release date of the next part of the series
 film kaa naam:prem ratan dhan pyodairector:suraj badjatyaster cast:salmaan khan, sonam kapur, diparaj rana, nil nitin mukesh, swara bhaskar, anupam kher, armaan kohli ,deepak dobariyaanvadhi:2 ghanta 54 minutesrtificate:uretimga:3 staralagbhag 27 saal pehle nirdeshak suraj badjatya ne industry ko prem ke rup main salmaan khan ko diya tha, jinhen 'maine pyaar kiya' film main kaaphi saraahaa gaya tha, uske baad donon ne milakar 'ham aapke hai koun', 'ham saath saath hai' filmein banaai jise darshak aaj bhi dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 Now after almost 16 years, Salman and Sooraj's film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' has been released once again
 kya 2015 main janata suraj badjatya kii style ko pasand karegi? kya commercial yug main yah paariwarik film ek baar phir se apanaai jaayegi? aaie film kii samiksha karte hai
 Story: This is the story of Prem (salman Khan) who lives in Ayodhya, who is very big hearted
 ramlila use jubaani yaad he, apni dhun main rahata he, prem apni kamai vahaan kii rajkumaari maithili (sonam kapur) ke cheritable trust main daan de diya karata he or is baar khud maithili se milane kii koshish main apane mitra kanhaiya (deepak dobariyaal) ke saath rajmahal chalaa jaataa he
 Love has a lot to do with Maithili's nature and the attitude of helping people
 khaastaur se jab baadh kii sthiti aati he to bhi maithili sabhi kii sahaayta karti he
 Prem gets the privilege of meeting Maithili in a few days and the atmosphere of love starts
 phir kahani main rajkumaar vijay (salmaan khan) or sauteli bahanon swara bhaskar (chandrika) or aashika bhaatia (radhika) ke saath-saath bhai ajay (nil nitin mukesh), dekh rekh karta chiraag (armaan kohli), dewan sahab (anupam kher) kii entry hoti he or paariwarik rishton kii uthal puthal vaali kahani saamne aati he
 Now it will be easy to sort out the complicated relationships? You will have to watch the film to know this
 scriptfilm kikahani kaalpanik or paariwarik rishton kii buniyadaper banaai gai he
 But in today's era, such old imagination cannot be digested
 moonch or bina muunchon kaa insaan apane swabhaav se chir parichiton ke dwaara pahachaanaa nahin ja paa rahaa he
 Although the cost spent on the film is also visible on the screen, but it seems meaningless in a way
 suraj badjatya sahab ko vaastaviktaa kaa bhi thodaa dhyaan dena chahie tha
 The script faded between gorgeous sets and great acting
 interval se pehle bana hua maahaul interval ke baad or bikharata gaya
 In the double role, Salman's work is justified with both his characters, while the rest of the film's actors like Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar, Anupam Kher, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Armaan Kohli, Deepak Dobriyal, Sanjay Mishra, Deepraj Rana have also played a comfortable role
 sangitafilm kaa sangeet pehle se hi lokapriy he khaastaur se tital trek, lekin kuch gaanon ko kam kiya ja saktaa tha jisaki vajah se film thodi or choti or crisp ho sakati thi
 The film became even longer due to the songs
 kamjor kadifilm kii kamjor kadi isaki script or gati he, jo or bhi zyada crisp ho sakati thi or isaki vajah se achche kalakaar hone ke baavjood film umdaa nahin ho saki he
 If the story was given special attention, the film would have gone to another level
 kyon dekhensalmaan khan kii maujuudagi,suraj badjatya ke paariwarik prem or puri tarahase saaf suthri filmon ke agar aap aadi hai, to yah film aap parivaar ke saath jarur dekhen

 But this project is getting delayed and the government here is increasing its cost

 The Prime Minister said, "more than one and a half million poor have got their pucca houses, Jan Dhan accounts of about one crore people have been opened

 raashtrapati pratibha patil ne prasar bharti ke siio ko hataane kii sifarish manjuur kar lee he
 Prasar Bharati CEO BS Lali has been accused of financial scams
 raashtrapati ne laali ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch supreme court se karaane kii sarkaar kii apil ko sweekaar kar liya he
 If found guilty, redness can be removed from the post
 laali ke khilaaf khilaaf cricket prasaaran adhikaron main bhrashtachar ke maamle saamne aae hai
 The President has ordered the Supreme Court to investigate it
 samvidhan ke mutabik prasar bharti ke siio ko keval tabhi pad se hataaya ja saktaa he jab unhen supreme court ke jajon dwaara doshi tehraaya jaae
 Significantly, Lali, who took over as Prasar Bharati chief in 2006, has been accused of ignoring the rules in selling the broadcasting rights of cricket matches to private broadcasting companies
 laali is maamle main pehle hi sivisi kii jaanch ke ghere main hai
 Lali is also under the watch of investigating agencies on the scandal in the Commonwealth Broadcasting Rights
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki raashtrapati pratibha patil kii yah sahmati pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara die ek sandarbh main ai he
 This was required under the Prasar Bharati Act

 The process of removal of redness has gained momentum as soon as the President gives the green signal to set up an inquiry committee of the Supreme Court

 The Central Vigilance Commission accused Lali of violating parliamentary privilege, benefiting many broadcasting companies and committing economic irregularities
 antarrashtriya maryaadaaon ko taak par dhar ek bhartiya rajanyik kii america main jama-talaashi or giraftaar is baat kaa sanket he ki donon deshon ke bich kabhi falte-phoolate rishte main gahari daraar aa chuki he
 The US and India formed a strategic partnership with great fanfare, not the owner-client relationship
 haalanki america kaa apane 27 samrik sahyogiyon ke saath maalik-graahak jaisaa rishta hi he, saajhedaari vaala nahin
 Actually, partnership demands a relationship of equality and mutual respect
 shaayad isi vajah se america bharat ko bhi apane anya sahyogiyon jaisaa hi maanakar chal rahaa tha, isiilie devayani khobragade ke maamle main bharat kii pratikriya se vah vaaki chaunkaa
 For India, this matter became a nose question
 bharat se america kii 'samasya’ isi maamle tak simit nahin he
 For example, one-third of the T-visas issued by the US to victims of human trafficking involving sex or labor are from India
 is tarah vah sansar kii sabase adhik jansankhya vaale loktantr kii nyaay-vyavastha kii khilli udaata rahata he
 As the family of Khobragade's maid was evacuated from India and the US embassy illegally obtained a tax concessional ticket for her, it looks like human trafficking in the state
 is harakat main sajeesh ke paryaapt sanket bhi hai, kyonki jaise hi america ne duniya ke puliciye kii tarj par naukaraani ke parivaar ko uske apane desh se baahar nikaal liya, khobragade ko pakad liya gaya
 Also, do not forget that the US does not dare to arrest or search a Chinese or Russian diplomat in such a case for alleged mistreatment of a maid, because she would have reacted as quickly
 darasal, khobragade kii giraftaar ke mahaj hafte bhar pehle hi neuyork ke bigdel abhiyojak pritinder singh bharaara ne kai roosi rajanyikon or vaanijya duutavas ke adhikariyon par medicade ko 15 lakh dollar kii chapat lagane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 But he was allowed to leave the US even before the allegations were exposed
 lekin bharat ne is apmaan ke badale kya kiya? manmohan singh to use 'maamuli halchal’ kahkar taal gaye
 Despite all the hustle and bustle, India has so far removed some special rights granted to American diplomats and consulate officials and their families
 yah bedam gusse kaa bemisaal udhaaharan he
 India could not make any attempt to punish America
 iske vipareet usne america ko si-130je sainya vimaanon kii atirikt khep ke liye 1
 Gave gift of new deal worth $ 01 billion
 isse uski aupchaarik maafee kii maang bhi bemaani ho gai
 He did not even stop the deployment of his new ambassador in Washington to the US response
 hamaare chatukaar videsh mantri jab america ke enese kii duniya bhar main kukhyat guptchari ko 'jasusi nahin, mahaj computer study’ kah dete hai to america ko zyada hi chhot lene kaa dosha kyon den?koi bharat sarkaar se yah sawaal bhi nahin poochta ki usne america duutavas or vaanijya duutavas ke karmchaariyon ko apni taraf se ekatarfa visheshadhikaar kyon de rakhaa he or ab kyon use waapas le rahi he? bharat kii gulam maansikta kii intiha yah he ki usne america vaanijya duutavas ke adhikariyon ke parivaaravaalon ko rajanyik riyaayat de rakhi he jiske ve hakdaar bhi nahin hai
 Lured by visas for their relatives, Indian rulers had blocked the backdoor of the US embassy in New Delhi to allow American officials to go to the unabashed American club
 bharat sarkaar ne apane desh main america skulon or gaiyr-rajanyik sansthaanon main karyrat logon ko apane yahaan ke shram kanoon ke tahat laane kii bhi koshish nahin kii
 These labor laws require PF to be deposited and income tax paid
 america rajanyikon ke rishtedaar bina bharat kii anumati liye yahaan america sansthaanon main kaam karte hai or apni aamadani par iskar bhi nahin dete
 India continues to ignore such violations, if it were done in the United States, it would have had serious consequences and perhaps even been jailed
 bharat ne ab america duutavas se inke byore dene ko kaha he
 So, will the embassy give these details? Who will whip the law? Ruling on India's Beridar? Another question is yet to be answered — when was the non-bailable warrant issued from India against Khobragade's absconding maid, how did India's immigration officials let her family out on T-visas?

 dilli kii sadakon kii haalat par chintaa jataate hue dilli ucch niyalay ne is saal aktubar main rashtramandal khelon se teen maheene pehle suhaani tasviir pesh karne par dilli nagar nigam ko aade haathon liya he
 Justice Kailash Gambhir said, "despite many instructions from this court, the picture looks worse than what is being reported to this court in affidavits
" ’’ unhone nigam se teen saptaah main sthiti report maangi
 Referring to reports of traffic jams at several places after the initial rains in the city, the court said, "roads have sat due to waterlogging
" adhiktar pramukh sadakon par lambey yatayaat jam ke kaaran shahar ko thamate dekha gaya he
 The Commonwealth Games are close and in such a situation it is an embarrassment for this city to pass through such roads
 ’adaalat ne kaha, ‘‘yah dikhaai detaa he ki sadak nirmaan kaa kaam kharaab tarah se kiya gaya or adhiktar sadakon par ek bhi barish sahane kii kshamta nahin he isliye barish ke har mausam ke baad sadakon kii haalat badtar ho jaati he
 Drawing the corporation, the court said, "the Public Works Department and the MCD are completely insensitive to the condition of the citizens
 ’ sadakon ke maanakon ke pareekshan ke sambandh main nigam dwaara ek halafname main kiye gayi daawey par aapatti jataate hue adaalat ne kaha, ‘‘motor chaalkon ke liye haalat niraashajanak he or gaddhedaar sadakon par chalane se vaahanon kii avadhi bhi kam ho rahi he

 chhattisgarh ke bijapur or jagadalpur main aadha darjan se zyada aise gaanv hai jahaan naksaliyon kii khauf kii vajah se graminon ke aadhaar card nahin ban paae hai
 Due to lack of Aadhaar card, villagers have to work hard to buy food and drink from government ration shops
 darasal naksaliyon ke kabje vaale is gaanv main naksali netaaon ne farmaan jari kar rakhaa he ki kisi bhi gramin ne yadi aadhaar card banwaaya to uski khayr nahin
 The villagers did not show any interest in getting Aadhaar cards done due to concern about their lives
 lekin ab yahi aadhaar card unki musiibat kaa kaaran ban gaya he
 The situation of Yashobai living in Gangalur village of Bijapur is similar
 is adivasee mahila ne chaar baar bijapur dak offis ke chakkar kaate lekin apana aadhaar card banavaane kii himmat nahin juta pai
 Before this, a team of government officials came to Yasho's village a year ago to make Aadhaar cards of villagers
 lekin naksaliyon ne unhen bairang lautaa diya
 The team of government officials of the Naxalite awe killed the village for the second time
 lekin sarkari afasar ye jarur bataa gaye ki jis kisi ko bhi aadhaar card banvaanaa ho to wo bijapur block offis aa jaae
 Not only Yashobai, many villagers went to the block office three to four times with him
 lekin jaise hi unhen naksali nafarmani kii yaad ai unki himmat tut gai
 These people returned to their village without making an Aadhaar card
 udhar sarkari rashan dukaanon main aadhaar card ke link naa hone se graminon ko khaane-pine kii vastuon ke liye do chaar hona pad rahaa he
 This situation is not only about Yashobai
 aadha darjan se zyada gaanv ke lagbhag 40 hajaar graminon kaa aadhaar card nahin ban paaya he
 The reason is just Naxalite awe
 naksali nahin chaahate ki unke kabje vaale ilaakon main koi bhi sarkari sukh suvidha pahunche
 They are not only opposing the government schemes, but are warning the government staff executing these schemes to kill them
 bastar main jangal ke bheetar basii adivaasiyon kii ek badi aabaadi khaane-pine kii vastuon ke liye sarkari rashan dukaanon par nirbhar he
 In the open market, lentils, rice and gram are expensive, they buy it only from PDS shops
 lekin in dukaanon par bhi naksaliyon ne apana paharaa laga diya he
 On the other hand, the police is monitoring the situation
 wo logon kosuraksha kaa bharosadila rahi he
 It is also encouraging villagers to make Aadhaar cards
 lekin naksali khauf ke chalate uski tamaam koshishen beasar sabit ho rahi hai
 The Government of Chhattisgarh has made it mandatory to link the Aadhaar card to ration shops to remove the PDS system and prevent misappropriation of food grains in government ration shops
 in dukaanon se riyayati dar par unhen hi anaaj muhaiyaa ho paaegaa jinke pasaadhar cardehai
 In such a situation, these tribals are struggling for ration water

 Sports Officer said - do not return the medal
 In this case, Sports Officer Jagdeep Verma says that Priyanka has got a certificate to participate in the competition, but she has not got the Gold Medal Certificate

 Australia's great cricketer Ian Chappell, known for his miserly praise, described Indian cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara, who scored runs in the current series, as the 'most precious gem' of Virat Kohli's 'empire'
 pujaara ne maujuuda siries main teen shatkeey paariyaan kheli hai, jisane bharat kaa prabhutv kaayam karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 Chappell has praised Pujara in a column written for espncricinfo

 The Indian team is close to winning the series for the first time in Australia
 unhone kaha, ‘kohli bhartiya cricket ke badshaah honge, lekin pujaara ne sabit kiya vah unke samrajya ke vafaadaar sahyogi or anmol ratna hai
 There have been many good things in this series for the Indian team, including the victory, including Pujara's defensive game

 Chappell was also impressed with young Indian wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant, who played an unbeaten innings of 159 runs in the fourth Test
 unhone kaha, ‘rishabh ne balle se shandaar kaushal dikhaaya
 He lacked discipline, but his attitude changed in the Melbourne Test and by the time Kohli declared the innings in Sydney, he had improved a lot

 On the second day of the Feroze Shah Kotla Test, Sri Lanka created a big drama by the players
 munh par mask lagaakar maidan main utre or baar-baar smog ke bahaane se match main baadha daalate rahe
 Due to this conspiracy by Sri Lankan players, captain Virat Kohli was unable to score a triple century and lost his wicket in the jhalet
 haalanki sajeesh or drame ke baavjood srilankai team kii haalat kharaab ho gai he
 In fact, as soon as after Lanka, Virat felt that Virat was heading towards a triple century, this team started to stop the match by pretending to be the team
 pehali baar kareeb 20 minute tak match rukaa rahaa
 a batsman who was cruising through it was now jittery
 munh par mask lagaakar munh chidhaa rahi thi lanka kii team mana ki smog tha, kaaphi tha
 But the same smog was for the umpires, also for the Indian batsmen
 kya srilanka ke khilaadi hi jananath se utre the jinhen hawa jehar lag rahi thi
 There was salt on the burn, sometimes the coach, sometimes the manager came to the ground
 tamaasha karti rahi lanka kii timaye kya majaak chal rahaa tha
 If Lanka were not to play, its captain could deny it completely
 magar naa to wo inkaar kar rahe the or naa hi ikraar
 The intervening matches were only wrangling
 inhen vaardaaton ne viraat kaa wicket liya, unhen tisare shatak se maharum kiya
 Did Lanka forget India's favor? 1996 world cap main jab duniya ne srilanka jane se inkaar kar diya tha ye bharat kii team thi jo uske saath khadi thi
 When Lanka was battling terrorism for decades, it was an Indian team that always toured there
 match main srilanka team kii haalat pataliehsaan, vafa hi nahin haya tak ghol kar pi gai he lanka kii team
 Perhaps the fear of defeat has gone so far that its captain's mind has stopped working
 jab had ho gai tabaviraat ne parihi ghoshit kar di
 After that the faces of Lankan players blossomed
 lekin unki khushi chand minuton tak hi chali
 Indian bowlers soon filled the fear in this camp
 srilankai team do din kaa khel hone tak puri tarah se mejabaanon ke dabaav main dikhi
 Sri Lanka scored 44 by the end of the second day's play
 3 overon main 3 wicket ke nuksaan par 131 ran bana liya tha
 On this attitude of Sri Lankan cricketers, Indian team bowling coach Bharat Arun said that the focus of the visiting team players was probably on pollution and not on the match
 din ke duusare satr main srilanka ke takreeban paanch se zyada khilaadi maidan par pradooshan ke kaaran mask lagaakar utre the
 Bharat said that Virat batted for almost two days but did not wear a mask
 baar-baar match rukne se kohli kaa lay tutaa?din ke duusare satr main bharat jab paanch wicket khokar 509 ranon par tha tabhi srilankai gendbaaj lahiru gamage ko pareshaani hui or khelaa roka gaya
 Meanwhile, Sri Lankan players complained about the bad environment to the on-field umpires
 jiske kaaran takreeban 15 minute kaa khel rukaa
 The match resumed and the wicket of r Ashwin (4) fell
 isi bich captain kohli bhi apane test kariyar ke sarvshereshth score 243 ranon par lakshan sandakana kii gend pagabaadha qaraar de die gaye
 Surprised by the action of the Sri Lankan team! After Kohli's departure, the game stopped once again in the 127th over

 Peter Mukherjee, along with his wife Indrani, is accused of being involved in a conspiracy to kill Indrani's first daughter Shishina Bora in 2012, due to which she has been in jail for the last two years
 haalanki ab tak mumbai police or sibiai kii jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki khud indrani ne apane purv pati sanjeev khanna ke saath milakar beti shina bora kaa gaal ghonta tha, sanjeev isi kaam ke liye khaas taur par kolkata se indrani ke paas aayaa tha
 According to the agency, Peter's role in this murder plot was limited
 jaanch ke anusaar 28 april 2012 ko jab shina bora kii hatya hui thi, us din peter bharat main nahin tha
 He went abroad
 court ke die gaye patr main indrani ne kaha he ki uske pati peter or driver shyamwaar raay ne 2012 main ye sajeesh rachi thi or shina bora ko agava kiya tha
 After this all the evidence was also erased
 indrani ne latter main likhaa he ki peter ne duusare logon ke saath milakar use fansaane ke halaat banaae the
 Indrani has addressed Sheena Bora as her daughter for the first time, indicating that she has strong reasons
 indrani kaa maananaa he ki yah kaam sirf peter or raay kaa nahin ho saktaa he, is maamle main anya kai log bhi shaamil hai
 Indrani, in a letter to the court, appealed to have Peter's two-year CDR removed
 usne 1 janvari 2012 se 31 disambar tak or 1 janvari 2015 se un donon kii giraftaar tak kii sidiaar nikalwaaye jane kaa anurodh adaalat se kiya he
 In a two-page letter, Indrani has called Sheena at least three times as my daughter
 indrani patr main kahati he ki use uske liye insaaf paane kii jarurat he
 According to Indrani, Sheena probably lost her life due to greed, betrayal, jealousy, longing and bad will of the people
 ye wo log the jinase wo bahut pyaar karti thi or unhen bharosemand samajhati thi
 At the end of the letter, Indrani signed herself and wrote herself as Indrani Bora

 tippaniyan After losing in a 'do or die' match against the West Indies in the Twenty20 World Cup, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said his batsmen were yet to learn to play short pitch balls
 isliye unhen is mahatvapurn match main 14 ran se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 India had to win the match to stay in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, but losing in this match has diminished their chances of reaching the next round
 match ke baad press conference main dhoni ne kaha, ‘ballebaaji hamaari majbootee thi
 Chasing a 170-run target was not impossible
 lanbaa ballebaaji kram hone ke baavjood hamaare ballebaaj westeindies pes bydaree ke saamne fail ho gaye
 We once again found that we did not have the right technique to play short pitch balls
 yah jaahir taur par niraashajanak he
 Dhoni said, "if you have to play short pitch balls continuously in T20 then it becomes difficult because you can't miss a lot of balls and when the runs are not scored then there is pressure
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamane toornament se pehle acchhee taiyaariyaan kii thim or hamen pataa tha ki short pich gendon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 But we could not implement our plan properly '
 dhoni ne visheshgy gendbaaj kii jagah ek atirikt ballebaaj ko khilaane ke nirnay kaa bachaav karte hue kaha, ‘hamaare pramukh gendbaaj sachmuch acha pradarshan kar rahe hai or vipakshi tiimon ke zyaadaatar ballebaaj hamaare spinneron ke saamne jujh rahe hai
 Harbhajan bowled well and put pressure
 mere vichaar se hamaari gendbaaji line ap anya tiimon kii line ap se alag nahin he
 He said, "our opening bowlers performed well and gave us a good start in the first six overs
 mujhe nahin lagata ki hamaare paas gendbaajon kii kami thi
 The Indian captain also defended Ravinder Jadeja, who had a poor fielding, missed the catch of Shivnarine Chanderpaul and conceded 27 runs in two overs
