 After Agra, he came to Aligarh to do his BA in 1931
 yahaan unka rabta saadat hasan manto, ismat chugtai, ali sardaar zaafari, sibte hasan, jaan nisaar akhtar jaise namchin shaayaron se hua
 His Sohbat spared the Kalam of Majaz even more Kashish and Vusayat
 yaheen unhone apana takhllus 'majaaz' apanaaya
 In Agra, where he was confined to Ishqiya Shayari, that shayari got a new dimension in Aligarh
 agra se aligarh tak aate aate shabaab, inkalab main tabdeel ho gaya tha
 It was here that Mazaaz created a nazal like 'inquilab'
 iske baad unhone raat or rail, najar, aligarh, najar khalida, andheri raat kaa musafir, saramayadaari jaisi rachanaaen likhin
 Alaz's soul resided in Aligarh
 vah kahin bhi rahe unka dil apane shahar ke liye dhadkta rahaa
 But by then Mazaz was so engrossed in his shayari and his personality that hostel girls used to sing songs of Mazaz and weave their dreams by connecting with him
 sach to yah he ki urdu shaayari ne vah daur bhi dekha he jab shaayar ishq kii duniyaan main sapanom ke rajkumaar kii si haisiyat rakhte the
 Young girls used to keep pictures of poets at their head and the most prominent names of this era include asrar-ul-haq Majaz
 prem majaaj kii shaayari kaa centre tha, jo baad main unki aawaragardee or dard main badal gaya
 He was the poet of the realization-e-ishq
 unke paas apni muhabbate izhaar kaa behtareen lahaza tha
 Some of your eyes were confusing, some i had to be spoiled too
 
 
 mashhoor afasaana nigaar ismat chugtai ne apni aatmakatha 'kagaz he pairahan' main majaaz kii mashhooriyat kaa zikr karte hue likhaa he, "majaaz kaa kavy sangrah 'aahang' jab prakashit hua, to girls college kii ladkiyaan ise apane sirahaane takie main chipa kar rakhti or aapas main baithkar parchiyaan nikaaltin ki ham main se kisko majaaz apni dulhan banayega
 "mazaz himself once wrote that: i am very strong, i am a jinx-e-ulfat, i am in love, i am in love with the world, i am a loveless person
 What is life, i am guilty, but i am guilty, but i am guilty
 Majaz is not only called Ishq, but also a well-known Tehreek and a poet of Inquilab
 mahaj 44 saal kii choti si jindagi main urdu sahitya ke 'keats' kahe jane vaale asraar ul haq 'majaaz' ne urdu adal kii duniya ko badi rachanaaon kii vah saugat de gaye, jiskaa jod nahin miltaa
 In 1935, he moved to Delhi as an assistant editor of All India Radio's magazine Awaaz
 ek amir shaadi shuda stri ke ishk ne unki jindagi main aisa tufaan laa diya jisase vah kabhi ubar na sake
 Mazaaz started drinking alcohol due to his failure in Ishq
 sharaab kii lat is kadar badi ki logon ne kahana shuru kar diya ki majaaz sharaab ko nahin, sharaab majaaz ko pi rahi he
 This magazine could run only for a year, so he came back to Lucknow
 lakhanu main 1939 main sibte hasan, ali sardaar jaafaree or majaaz ne milakar 'nayaa adab' kaa sampaadan kiya
 But this sizzle also could not last long due to economic difficulties
 kuch dinon baad vah phir dilli aa gaye
 This time he worked as an assistant librarian in the 'harding Library', but Delhi did not like him again
 pyaar nahin milanaa tha, so nahin mila
 Disappointed with Delhi, Majaz went to Bombay, but Bombay too did not like him
 yaheen unhone likhaa
 
 
 The night of the city and I, nashad-o-nakara Firujgagati awake, the street is a tramp of the tramp, how long should i do it, what should i do, what should i do, what should i do
 darasal jiske ishk main us daur kii samoochee ek peedi shikaar thi, vah kisi or ke ishk kaa shikaar ho chukaa tha
 So the hearts of young people never gave up the fun
 bombai se niraash ho vah nababon ke shahar lakhanu aa gayi
 He liked Lucknow very much
 lakhanu ke bare main unki yah najm is shahar se unke lagaav ko behad khubasurat dhang se bayaan karti he
 Firdousen Husno Ishq Hai Daman is settling in Lucknow eyes, Ghazalane Lucknow is looking for a job again, then eyes are on Lucknow
 par is khubasurat shahar ne unke dastaane ishk ke dard ko or badha diya
 After coming here, he started drinking even more alcohol, due to which his condition deteriorated continuously
 unki pidaa, dard, ghutan akelaapan itnaa bad gaya tha ki ve zyaadaatar khamosh rahane lage
 He was addicted to alcohol, which proved fatal for him
 1940 se pehle nervas brakedown se lekar 1952 ke tisare brakedown tak aate-aate ve shaareerik rup se kaaphi aksham ho chuke the
 After the third breakdown of 1952, he was recovering as soon as his sister Safia died
 yah sadma unhen kaaphi baari padaa
 But before reaching this stage, Mazaz tried to say ghazal on everything beautiful of his time like a responsible poet
 har jor zulm or sangharsh ke kilaaf taraane likhe
 He celebrated the euphoria of every human achievement and expressed the sorrow of the loss of humanity
 jagah, log, ghatnaayen, prem, chahat, tadap, sangharsh sab unke vishay the
 He also wrote Tarana for Aligarh Muslim University, which is still the Tarana of this university
 kehete hai aisa unhone jawaharlal nehru kii ichha par kiya tha
 Not only this, Mazaz also adapted Tagore's poetry into poetry in his style
 unhone gandhiji kii hatya par jo shoakgeet likhaa, usamen beemaari ke baavjood unka jununee tevar barkaraar tha-hindu chalaa gaya na musalmaan chalaa gayinsaan kii justuju main ek insaan chalaa gayaakush he badi jo daam ye neki pe daal kerakh denge ham badi kaa kalejaa nikaal keyah behad afsos kii baat he ki majaaz ne bahut kam zindagi pai
 At the age of just 44, he said goodbye to this crazy world
 is duniya se unke alavida hone kaa tarika bhi kitna dardanaak or haulanaak tha
 The doctors had forbidden him from drinking alcohol, but where would the advice of the doctors come in front of friends
 vah tadi pine lage the, par ye sab unke liye jehar jaise the
 It is said that in Ishq on the ill-fated evening of December 4, 1952, Gamzada Mazaz spent a night with friends on the terrace of a tavern house in Lucknow
 dost to pikar chale gaye majaaz vahiin nashe main besudh pade rahe
 The world woke up on the morning of December 5, but where did the fun happen? He had moved from this world
 unhone pehle hi kah rakhaa tha-dil ko mahav-e-gam-e-dildaar kiye baithe harind banate hai magar zehar pie baithe hanchahate hai ki har ek zarraa shagufa ban jaeor khud dil hi main ek kaar liye baithe hai
 
 
 Some college students were allegedly misbehaved at a cinema hall in Chennai on Sunday as they did not stand during the national anthem before the film started
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle hi supreme court ne aadesh diya he ki har film ke shuruuaat main rashtriya gaan bajaayaa jayega or is dauraan darshakon kaa khadaa hona anivaary he
 They accused the students of insulting the national anthem under which they could face up to three years in jail
 lekin jin logon ne in chaatro par kathith taur par hamalaa kiya unke khilaaf kisi tarah kii kaarywahi nahin kii gai he
 It is being told that four boys and four girls went to see the show "chennai 600028 II" at 11:30 in the morning, during which about 20 people misbehaved with them
 naam na bataae jane kii shart par in chaatro main se ek ne bataaya ki 'interwel ke dauraan kuch log jo hamaare peeche baithe the, vah bhaddi tippaniyan karne lage or vijayakumar naam ke aadmi ne mere dost kii collar pakad lee or use maarane kii dhamkee dene laga kyonki usne raashtragit kaa apmaan kiya he
 ' kuch hi palon main ladaai shuru ho gai
 She says' 20 people started beating us and abusing us
 ' suraksha guard ne chaatro se chale jane ko kaha lekin ve nahin gaye kyonki vijayakumar ne dhamkee di thi ki agar vah theatre chhodkar gaye to unhen chhodega nahin
 The student said, 'we who have not stood in the theater, we are all very socially conscious and have also worked for the society
 jo log puri film main bhadde chutkulon par hansate rahe, unhone meri ek dost ke saath bhi badasluki kii he, vah hamen dhamkee bhi de rahe the
 It was extremely insolent
 'tippaniyan Eventually the students had to leave the film

 Vijaykumar alleged that his friends were also killed
 gauratlab he ki 30 november ko supreme court ne aadesh diya tha ki sabhi cinemahol main film shuru hone se pehle rashtriya gaan par khadey hona anivaary he
 Then last week, the court also made it clear that the doors of the theater would be closed during the national anthem but they would not be latch

 One of these students, on the condition of anonymity, told that during the interview, some people who were sitting behind us started making lewd comments and a man named Vijaykumar grabbed my friend's collar and threatened to kill him
 Felt because he insulted the national anthem
 ' The fight started in a few moments
 vah bataati he '20 logon ne hamaari pitayee shuru kar di or hamen gaaliyaan dene lage
 The security guards asked the students to leave but they did not leave as Vijayakumar threatened that if he left the theater, he would not leave
 chaatra ne bataaya 'ham log jo theatre main khadey nahin hue, ham sabhi saamaajik taur par kaaphi sachet hai or samaaj ke liye kaam bhi karte aae hai
 People who kept laughing at lewd jokes throughout the film have also misbehaved with a friend of mine, he was also threatening us

 a case was registered on Vijaykumar's complaint, according to which the students were not just sitting at the time of the national anthem, but were taking selfies and talking to each other

 ram mandir mudde par bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi ke bayaan par jab unki tippanee maangi gai, to unhone kaha, ram mandir kaa nirmaan vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) kaa mudda he or yah maamla adaalat main lambit he, lekin siddhant rup se ham mandir nirmaan ko lekar patibaddh hai
 The comments unhone kaha ki aam chunaav main agar bijepi ko purna bahumat miltaa he or agar ram mandir nirmaan main koi aadchan aati he, to party iske liye samvidhan main sanshodhan bhi kara sakati he
 Mishra, however, also said that an effort will be made to first build consensus among all stakeholders related to the matter
 isse pehle, vaajapeyi ne bhi kathith rup se kaha tha ki bijepi is mudde ko lekar patibaddh he or agar jarurat hui to iske liye samvidhan main sanshodhan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The senior BJP leader said that he was not in favor of building the mosque in Ayodhya
 unhone kaha, ayodhya kii paridhi ke bheetar koi masjid nahin banani chahie
 He said that if the BJP gets an absolute majority in the general election and if there is a bottleneck in the construction of the Ram temple, then the party can also amend the constitution for this

 vakya ganga ke kinare hua jahaan baari barsaat ke chalate kaaphi keechad jamaa tha
 For a scene of the documentary, Baba was shown taking a pledge in the river water but after giving the shot, Baba was trapped in the mud when he was coming out
 kaaphi koshish ke baad bhi baba ramdev jab khud keechad se nahin nikal paae to unit ke logon or baba ke sahyogiyon ne unhen vahaan se baahar nikaala
 This documentary is being made on the life of Baba Ramdev under the name Yog Yatra, which is being directed by famous serial director Kavita Chaudhary
 tamilnadu ke vitt mantri di jayakumar ne mangalvaar ko rajya ke mukhyamantri ike palanisami se mulaaqaat ke baad do ahm baaten kahin
 For the first time, almost all mlas of the AIADMK want no family to dominate the party or the government and a committee is being formed which will decide who will be the next general secretary of AIADMK as well as the other office bearers
 
 yani saaf he ki bengalooru jail main band shashikala ko party ke mahasachiv pad se hataaya jayega or iske saath-saath unke bhattije dinakaran ko bhi AIADMK ke up mahasachiv pad se hatana padegaa
 With this the door of the return of the former Chief Minister of the state and the rebel o Panneerselvam of AIADMK and his supporters has been opened, because Panneerselvam has been saying from the beginning that he does not want the post of Chief Minister, just that the Sasikala family has power and the party Want to keep away from isse purv somvaar subah dilli police ne shashikala ke bhattije or party ke up mahasachiv dinakaran ko party simbel ke liye ek shaks ko rishwat dene kaa aaropee banaaya or ek shaks ko giraftaar bhi kiya tha
 After this, the politics in Tamil Nadu increased rapidly
 dinakaran ke khilaaf mukadmaa or shashikala kaa jail main hona, donon hi party or sarkaar ke liye ek boj se ban gaye the, kyonki chaahe wo mukhyamantri hon yaa phir duusare mantri or bade adhikari
 
 
 He had to consult not only Dinakaran and Sasikala's husband m Natarajan before the big decision, but also had to come to Bangalore
 
 There was also a lot of anger among the ministers
 tippaniyan Their biggest fear was that if the two-card election symbol of AIADMK got stuck in the legal bets and left the party, then the people who believe Amma, Jayalalithaa, will never forgive them
 satta main aana to dur unke liye chunaav jeetna bhi mushkil hoga
 In such a situation, in order to serve the interests of the party and the government, Sasikala and her family have decided to offer sacrifices to the leaders, who were given the reins of power after Jayalalithaa's death
 samiti kaa faisla aate hi shashikala or dinakaran ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaane ke saath saath panniraselvam camp kii vaapasi par aupchaarik muhar laga di jaaegi
 This means that Sasikala, who is lodged in Bengaluru jail, will be removed from the party's general secretary and along with her nephew Dinakaran will also have to step down from the post of AIADMK deputy general secretary
 iske saath hi rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or AIADMK ke baagi o panniraselvam or unke samarthakon kii party main vaapasi kaa darwaja khulaa gaya he, kyonki panniraselvam shuru se kah rahe hai ki mukhyamantri ke pad kii unhen chaah nahin, bas wo shashikala parivaar ko satta or party se dur rakhana chaahate hai
 Earlier on Monday morning, Delhi Police accused Sasikala's nephew and party deputy general secretary Dinakaran of bribing a man for the party symbol and also arrested one
 iske baad tamilnadu main siyasat tej ho gai
 Both the case against Dinakaran and Sasikala being imprisoned became a burden for the party and the government, whether it was the Chief Minister or other ministers and senior officials
 
 
 unhen bade faisle se pehle na sirf dinakaran or shashikala ke pati em natarajan se salaah leni padati thi, balki kehete hai ki bengalooru bhi aana padataa tha
 
 isse bhi mantriyon main khaasaa rosh tha
 The comments sabase bada dar unhen yah sata rahaa tha ki agar kanoonee daanv-pench main funskar AIADMK kaa do pattey vaala chunaav chinh party ke haath se nikal gaya to ammaa yani jayalalita ko apana sabakuch maanane vaali janata unhen kabhi maaf nahi karegi
 Even if they come to power, it will be difficult for them to win the election
 aise main party or sarkaar ke hiton ko saadhane ke liye shashikala or unke parivaar kii bali un netaaon ne hi chadhaane kaa faisla kiya he, jinhen jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad shashikala ne satta kii bagdor thamai thi
 With the decision of the committee, Sasikala and Dinakaran will be shown a way out and a formal stamp will be given on the return of the Panneerselvam camp

 argedy ne kaha he ki aakhir mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne sach ugal hi diya
 Party spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav issued a statement in Patna, saying that Nitish Kumar had finally unleashed the truth
 gathbandhan kii aayu dedh saal bataakar unhone ye bataa diya ki sab kuch pehle se tay tha
 Tejashwi has already said, we are pretending Nitishji has to go to BJP
 ab tejasvi kii baat bhi pusht ho gai
 Shakti Singh Yadav said, if Nitishji had to go with BJP then why did Lalu come with him
 bihar kii janata ke saamne aaj spasht ho gaya ki nitish ji kursi ke liye kisi ke paas ja sakate hai
 Nitish ji will stifle every truth in an angry manner
 aane vaale din main yah bhi bataayenge ki kis ghotaale main funsane ke chalate bhaajapa se haath milaae hai
 Let me tell you, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the day the alliance was formed, we knew that it should not last more than one and a half years
 iske baad bhi dedh saal se bhi zyada chalaa diya
 The alliance lasted for 20 months
 nitish kumaar kaa kahana he ki jis tarah se lalu prasad yadav par chaara ghotaale main trial chalaa or sajaa hui
 How would we react in such a situation? adaalat ke faisle par hamane koi pratikriya nahin di he
 But if the Grand Alliance had a government, it would have been difficult to run
 tanaav kaa maahaul rahata ham kya jawaab dete
 The RJD has alleged that Nitish Kumar has given a free hand to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat
 log is samay lalu prasad yadav ko yaad kar rahe hai
 Who did not allow Pravin Togadia to enter Bihar
 bhagwat bihar kii ekta ko khandit karne kii koshish kar rahen hai
 RJD National Vice President Shivanand Tiwari reacted to Nemohan Bhagwat, saying that Mohan Bhagwat said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's discipline is like military
 unka yah bhi daawa he ki kisi aakasmik chunauti kaa saamana karne ke liye sangh miletry se zyaada furti se taiyaar ho saktaa he
 With this claim, Bhagwat ji questions the agility and quickness of the Indian Army
 apane sanghathan kaa bakhaan karne ke ati-utsaah main apni fouj ko kamatar bataanaa kam se kam deshbhakti kaa parichaayak to nahin hi mana ja saktaa he
 Shivanand Tiwari further said, Bhagwat ji claims that the discipline of the Sangh is like military
 lekin aisa anushaasan to chintaa paidaa karata he
 Because blindly following orders is the first lesson of military discipline
 kya kisi vivekshil vyakti se yah apeksha kii ja sakati he ki vah apane vivek ko tilanjali dekar kisi aadesh kaa aankh mundakar paalan karegaa
 Therefore, when an organization working in the field of society, culture or politics claims that it has discipline like military, then it is a matter of concern
 kyonki aisa sanghathan vivekwan se zyada vivekshunya vyakti paidaa karegaa

 After all, what did the Congress need to be skeptical about? Bose was the only charismatic leader who could unite the opposition against the Congress and pose a serious challenge in the 1957 elections
 yah kahana behatar hoga ki agar bose jinda hote to jis gathbandhan ne congress ko 1977 main haraaya, usne 1962 ke chunaav main yaa phir 15 saal pehle hi congress ko dhwast kar diya hota

 ye diariyaan 2012 main prakashit hui thim jisamen british aantarik suraksha sevaaon ke saath ibi ke nabhinal rishton kaa zikr tha
 The priority of MI5 was to keep an eye on the communists
 yahi viraasat ibi ko bhi praapt hui
 On his tour of India in March 1947, Liddell claimed that he had obtained approval from Nehru to hire a security lion officer of MI5 in New Delhi after the British Raj was abolished

 These stories of Bose's escape while he was alive were fabricated: Bose disguised himself as a Pathan to travel to Afghanistan, became an Italian businessman to travel in Russia, and landed in a submarine in Germany in the middle of the Indian Ocean to Japan 
 sarkaar ne netaji kii filon ko saarvajanik karne se inkaar nahin kiya hota to in tamaam kathaon par kab kaa viraam lag gaya hota
 Says Wajahat Habibullah, 'this fact in itself deepens Bose's mystery that files that should have been made public in the 1960s and 1970s have not yet been done

 All governments after Nehru have said the same thing to leaders, researchers and journalists that the contents of more than 150 files related to Netaji are so sensitive that exposing them can cause law and order problems, especially in West Bengal can it happen

 The attack on Amarnath Yatra is being condemned across the country
 sarkaar se lekar vipaksh tak sabhi isaki ninda kar rahe hai
 People are demanding retaliation from the government, but this case has also raised many questions which are related to security lapses, our strategy against terrorism etc
 aakhir inke jawaab koun degaa?somvaar kii shaam jammu-kashmir ke anantnag main amarnath yatriyon par ek aatanki hamalaa hua jisamen 7 shraddhaluon kii maut ho gai or 19 yatri ghayal ho gaye
 All political parties have strongly condemned the attack
 dilli se lekar srinagar tak main hai level meeting ho rahi hai jisamen suraksha sahit kai muddon par charchaa ho rahi he
 But because of this attack, some such questions have come up which should be answered by Modi and Mehbooba Mufti government of the Center
 suraksha main chook, kiski jimmedaari?amarnath yatriyon par hue is hamale kii vajah se yatriyon ke suraksha se jude sawaal pramukhta se uth rahe hai
 The Amarnath Yatra started from 29 June
 yatra shuru hone ke saath hi khufia vibhaag ne alert jari kiya tha ki aatanki yatriyon ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 Tight security arrangements were made after this
 kareeb 40 hazaar surakshakarmi yatriyon kii suraksha main lagaae gaye the
 There were other arrangements as well
 phir yah hamalaa kaise ho gaya? hamale ke baad kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha, 'jo jaankaree uplabdh he, uske mutabik bas shrin board ke saath registerd nahin thi
 Apart from this, there was no security with the bus however, the administration is investigating the matter and something can be said only after the final report arrives
 ’ab sawaal uthta he ki agar yah itani samvedansheel yatra he or isko lekar itani chaakchauband vyavastha kii gai thi to ek puri bas kaise bina registration ke ilaake main gum rahi thi?kya sarkaar kii kashmir niti fail ho gai he?centre kii modi sarkaar he or jammu-kashmir main bijepi-pidipi gathbandhan kii sarkaar he
 PM Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh have been saying that their government will proceed on the same line in Kashmir on which Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government was rising
 apane bhaashanon main piem modi kashmir or kashmiriat kii baat bhi karte rahe hai lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki centre kii modi sarkaar ke paas koi thos kashmir niti hi nahin he
 They simply want to continue running their government in the state and that is why incidents of terrorist attacks and stone-pelting are increasing in the valley
 sargical strike karne vaali sarkaar ghuspaith kyon nahin roak paa rahi?uri army base camp par hue hamale ke baad daawa kiya gaya tha ki sena ne seemaa paar jaakar aatanki campon par karrwai kii he
 BJP party spokespersons called it a major action in TV channels and said that it broke the back of the terrorists
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki jo sarkaar seemaa paar jaakar karrwai kar sakati he wo rajya main ho rahi ghuspaith ko kyon nahin roak paa rahi?hurriyat ko milane vaala videshi funding kyon nahin roka ja rahaa?hurriyat ko pakistan se funding milti he yah baat desh main har koi jaanata he
 PM Modi himself has been raising this point in many rallies
 vahiin india today-ajtak kii ek report main bhi yah baat saamne aa chuki he ki kashmir ko ashaant karne vaale hurriyat ko paak funding ho rahi he
 If Kashmir is disturbed for this reason, then why is the central government not making such strong arrangements so that the money received by the Hurriyat can be stopped
 ghati main kyon bad rahe hai hinsa ke maamle?march 2015 main pidipi-bhaajapa gathbandhan kii sarkaar aane ke baad se rajya main 457 log maare ja chuke hai jinamein 48 aam log, 134 surakshakarmi or 275 ugravadi hai
 Apart from this, more than 100 people have been killed in the ongoing civil discontent and the process is still going on
 srinagar ke patrkaar or tippaneekar shujgat bukhari kehete hai, 'is baar hinsa kaa str 2016 se thodaa kam ho saktaa he, lekin kashmiri yuvaaon main algaav kaa ehsaas mukammal ho chukaa he
 Regarding the Hurriyat separatists who have used every protest in the Valley till date, they say that 'now they have no effect
 aisa lagata he ki unhen kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa
 ' tivi dharvaahik main ham sabhi ne naarad muni ko ishwar or bhakt ke bich sethu kaa kaam karte dekha he
 Narada Muni used to defeat the suffering of human beings of the world, but in the Kalyuga, a new form of Narada has been seen
 aaj ke naarad muni nyaay dilaate nahin balki nyaay ke liye guhaar lagaate dikh rahe hai

 Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir believes that even though the BCCI gave cricket the highly popular and successful Indian Premier League (IPL), it did little to promote and spread Test cricket
 apni bebaak tippaniyon ke liye mashhoor gambhir ne prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ke pramukh vinod raay or siio rahul johri kii upasthiti main yah baat kahi
 Gambhir said, 'I don't think BCCI promoted and spread Test cricket the way it did in odis and T20s
 mujhe westeindies ke khilaaf (2011 main) eden gardens par khelaa gaya test match yaad he
 India was batting on day one and only 1000 people were in the stadium
 ’
 
 
 So whether the toss will end in cricket, ICC will take a big decision
 During the program, Bada Faisal Gambhir said, "imagine playing Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman and only 1000 spectators present
 ’of spinner harbhajan singh ko lagata he ki test cricket duusari shrenee ke shaharon main yojit kiya janaa chahie lekin gambhir ko yah samaadhaan nahin lagata
 Gambhir, who played 58 Tests and 147 odis for India, said, "I don't know, but there is something wrong
" ho saktaa he ki unhen tii-20 or vanade main katautee kerani pade
 Gambhir believes that playing limited overs before Test matches can help a little

 maitreyi puspa
 a name that continues to flow in Hindi literature in its own tune
 hindi kii ekmaatr lekhika jinhone gaanv ke hi parivesh ko apni kalpana main shaamil kiya
 But this was not a fantasy but a reality
 or ye gaanv kaa parivesh kisi romantisised gaanv kaa nahin tha
 It was a village of cruel feudal system in which woman comes at the bottom
 maitreyi 72 saal kii hai
 His birthday is also coming
 hindi academy dilli kii upaadhyaksh hai
 Has written 12 novels
 sainkadon kahaniyaan
 Literature is coming in till date on 13 November

 Maitreyi ji, when did you feel that you could write stories? Any special thing that pulled you this way? i used to read a lot since childhood
 kavitaayen likhti thi
 But i did not send anyone
 mujhe apni kavitaaon ko kisi ko bhejnaa nahin tha
 Because i was not satisfied
 wo gaharaai nahin aa paati thi
 i felt that she could not say what i could say
 to main kahani upanyaas likhnaa shuru kar diya
 i did not know at that time that people would love things that i wrote
 maine kabhi sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Did not even think par sab hote gaya
 i am satisfied with my writing

 How did you choose your theme rural environment? Have you lived in Delhi? i come from the village itself
 meri kasbaai padhai hui he
 Have done MA from Bundelkhand
 maine gaanv ko zyada mahasoos kiya he
 When i came to Delhi, i found that the women of the villages are stronger
 kyonki unke paas suvidhaayen kam hoti hai
 But she finds a way to live amidst difficulties
 shaharon main ko kisi ko kisi se matlab nahin hota
 But in villages, you cannot hide anything
 aise main sari dikkaton ke bich wo auraten kaise rahati hai, ye tarif ke kaabil he
 i started living in Delhi, but i never forgot the village
 vahi khet-khalihaanon main auraton kii mehnat meraa stri-vimarsh ban gaya
 Many came from men's pens in the name of women
 par kisi aurat ne nahin likhaa tha
 Rajendra Yadav also said that Maitreyi has transported the heroines to the fields
 maine auraton ke bare main apane vishay badal-badal kar likhaa
 Tried to find every aspect

 Where do you see literature in 2016, after so much experience? i read new people
 par main saaf-saaf kah rahi hum
 i don't get that depth in today's writing
 kyonki sahitya soochna nahin he
 Then today's people do not tolerate criticism
 bas chap janaa chahie kisi tarah
 New writers don't even read, it seems
 kyonki jab tak padhenge nahin, likhenge kaise
 i used to read 10-12 novels before writing every novel
 kalam chalaanaa sabake vash kii baat nahin hoti
 Nowadays, compositions like Mamta Kalia do not come
 main apana naam nahin le sakati
 But until a few years ago very good compositions used to come
 sahitya aaj tak: dilli main 12-13 november ko jutenge kalam ke diggaj, jaane kaise karen registration4
 Maitreyi ji, do you think that the readership of Hindi has reduced now? If i say from my experience, my royalty comes so much that it does not seem that readership has reduced
 haa, ye he ki pathakon kii sankhya lekhakon ke hisaab se badalati he
 If the writer writes something very high, then he will get his kind of readers
 agar lekhak janata ke liye likhata he to uski tarah ke pathak milenge
 Premchand was a public writer
 log mujhe bhi isi shrenee kaa lekhak maanate hai
 As a writer, so does his reader
 maine to doodhnath singh or surendra verma vaali lekhnee ko bhi dekha he
 i also wanted Chand
 to mujhe yahi lagata he ki lekhak ko pathak chun letaa he
 In the era of tv-internet, people have a lot of information
 par agar aap readership dekhen to ye pataa chalata he ki log acha sahitya pasand karte hi hai

 He said that some people cite the experience of Maoists in Nepal and say that this will be done in India too
 lekin nepal or bharat ke pariprekshya ekadam alag hai
 There was a complete struggle in Nepal to establish a constitutional republic, but India has moved far beyond this situation

 The party said that to end the political hegemony of the ruling class, the working class would have to emerge as an alternative and independent political force
 yah koi chota or aasaan rasta nahin he
 "will the Indian Maoists feel this?" According to Male, the Maoists have no other way of struggle except through armed means on all the burning issues
 jab raajnneeti kii baat ho yaa chunaav kii baat ho to maovadiyon kaa usamen hastkshep kaa koi swatantra agenda nahin he or har jagah ve prabhaavshaalee partiyon ke haathon istemaal hote hai
 The party said that there are many such instances in the armed action of the Maoists when the murders of another political party worker or leaders or common people were attacked, buses and trains, railway stations were attacked, which further aggravated the public

 kalki bhagwaan banakar launch hue tamilnadu ke ek baba ke yahaan 600 karod kii sampatti mili he
 But the bigger news than this is that Kalki Bhagwan will not leave the country and will face the Income Tax Department as they respect the law of the country
 sahi baat he, jis desh ke logon ne itnaa paisa diya, us desh ke kanoon par vishwaas jataa kar kalki bhagwaan ne desh kaa bada sammaan kiya he
 Vijay Mallya or Nirav Modi should learn
 kalki bhagwaan ko kya dar he
 He is God
 bhagwaan bhaagate nahin hai
 v Vijay Kumar Naidu was a clerk in life insurance before becoming Kalki Bhagwan
 vahaan bhi inkaa kaam jivan kii suraksha hi tha or ab nae rup main jivan kii suraksha hi he tabhi to unke bhakt chaape ke baad bhi baba ke liye twitor par saport letters likh rahe hai
 Look at these notes on the table and decide who God is
 kalki bhagwaan hai yaa ye note bhagwaan hai
 It is time for recession so do not get emotional in deciding
 aisa lag rahaa he ki subah subah naashte main note khaae jate hai isamen 20 karod ke amareeki dollar hai
 44 crores is Indian currency
 88 kilo sona baraamad hua he
 Precious diamonds of 1271 carats have also been found
 cash raseeden mili hai jinase pataa chalata he ki 600 karod kii aghoshit sampattiyaan hai
 Kalki Bhagwan, who provides the facility of quick nirvana, calls himself a virtual supermarket
 emzan or flipcart yaa bigbazar supermarket kehalaate hai magar spritual supermarket kii kalpana tamilnadu main kii gai kisi ko pataa bhi nahin
 Different website shows that their blessings led to admission
 duube hue paise waapas mil gaye
 In a country where the system does not work, if Kalki gives admission to the Lord at his own pleasure, if he gets the money, then it shows that the people sitting in the system are not doing anything
 yahaan tak ki ammaa ke janmdin par ek bhakt kaa saadhaaran sikaa sone main badal gaya or wo ek karod kaa ho gaya
 This miracle is happening and we are wasting time sitting and watching TV
 main daawey ke saath kahata hum ki yah sab sunakar bahut se log aazamaane bhi chale jaaenge
 If you are laughing i will feel bad ek website ke mirekal section main likhaa he ki unke gahane kii dukaan main chor sara saamaan lekar ja rahaa tha, magar tabhi use kuch dhyaan aayaa or usne chori kaa saamaan vahiin rakh diya
 Because the name of that store is Shri Kalki Swarna Bhandar
 sochie chor tak badal ja rahaa he
 i am telling this story to make you believe that nothing can happen
 is samaaj main itani garibi he
 Even by the grace of Baba all the utensils were cleaned
 website par ek bhakt ne likhaa he ki raat main rasoi ke saare juthe bartan baba kii krupa se apane aap saaf ho gaye
 Think that even the utensils are going to be cleaned, if such Baba will not come on the land of India, then on which earth will he come
 china or america main aise baba isliye nahin ho sakate ki vahaan par ai pad main biji hai
 It is a matter of pride for India that by the grace of Baba, the dishes are cleaned at night
 agar aise hi baba har rajya or mohalle main hon to bartan saaf karne kii zarurat nahin he
 It will clear on its own
 kalki bhagwaan kii chennai main vananess uniwarsity he

 Kalki is an expert in God God realization
 yani ishwar kii prapti ke visheshgy hai
 Those who were wandering in search of God will regret why Kalki God is not known first
 iskar vibhaag ne inaki sampatti kii talash main kai jagah par chaape maare
 Raids were conducted at 40 places in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 ham log abhijit mukherjee ko lekar biji hai
 If Kalki had spent so much time on God, then the utensils of all the houses would have been cleaned today, do you know that the food would also have been made by itself
 clerk se kalki banane kaa laajawab idia he
 That is why i am not doing any evil to Baba because he is not the only one who achieves such success
 bas inase milane kii fees par sarkaar agar sabsidi de detii to acha rahata
 According to the report of Hindustan Times, there is a fee of Rs 5000 for darshan of Kalki Bhagwan and Amma Bhagwan
 vishesh darshan ke liye fees 50,000 se shuru hoti he
 The raid happened because Baba invested money in real estate and construction companies
 agar aapako afsos ho rahaa he to main kuch nahin kar saktaa
 In 2010, several petitions were filed against him in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh
 lekin iskaa nateeja kya hua pataa nahin
 If you still think that something can happen to this society, then you read the constitution
 artical 51-e ke hisaab se vaigyanik chetana kaa prasar kaam he sarkaar or samaaj kaa lekin jab baba khud ko hi vigyaan or vaigyanik ghoshit kar den to isamen samvidhan kaa kya kasoor
 i want many people who are disappointed in this era of recession, who have been seeing the notes for many days
 wo ek baar phir se noto kii is gaddi ko dekh len
 This is not showing that all our brothers sitting in the clerk's chair started to regret it
 bhagwaan sab koi nahin hota he
 There is no need to panic other babas
 jo koi yah soch rahaa he ki ham log bhi bhagwaan ban jate hai unke liye yahi salaah he ki ab let ho gai he

 Outlook magazine which had a long report on Kalki Bhagwan in 1997
 kalki crez naam se
 That report mentions the rumors and exploits surrounding them
 isse pataa chalata he ki media kii report kaise samaaj main shunya ho jaati he
 People are surrounded by such babas
 is kahani ko yaheen chhod dete hai
 We do not want you to be disappointed on behalf of the public how the public has become
 ham yah bhi nahin chaahate ki aap baba ko dekhakar niraash hon ki hamane aisa kyon nahin kiya
 This is a proof of the high quality of our society's stupidity
 agar aapaki rashtrabhakti or dharmik aasthaa aahat na ho to hindustan times kii janvari main chhapi ek khabar kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum
 The news was that China had warned its citizens to beware of the babas of India

 a Taiwanese actress was promoting the spiritual course of an organization based in South India
 aapako bataate hue apaar harsh ho rahaa he ki china ne yah alert inhen kalki bhagwaan kii vananess uniwarsity ke sambandh main tha
 When the Taiwanese actress promoted one of its courses, there was an uproar on China's social site Weibo

 Think China is aware of this
 bharat ke media ko bhi he pehle kai baar report chap chuki he lekin aapako ab khabar lag rahi he
 If there was proper publicity about this news, then after the arrival of the President of China, all the Baba people of India would have reached to protest what this is being said about the Babas in China
 par baabaaon tak yah khabar hi nahin pahunchi
 Surprisingly why our Babas did not protest in front of the President of China
 is khabar ko sunne ke baad kya aapako vaaki lagata he ki kuch ho saktaa he

 The basis of bjp's victory was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and converted the losing bet of power into victory
 bijepi ke karnataka vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke peeche paanch kaaran pramukh hai
 1

 Senior advocate Shyam Dewan, appearing for the petitioners challenging the government's decision to make Aadhaar compulsory in Attorney General KK Venugopal and various public welfare schemes, jointly put the matter before the bench and requested that the Constitution Bench in this regard Should be heard early
 jab nyaayamurti khehar ne venugopal or dewan se poocha ki kya maamle kii sunwaayee saat nyaayadhishon vaali samvidhan peeth dwaara kii jaani he, donon pakshon ne kaha ki yah sunwaayee paanch-nyaayadhishon kii peeth ko kerani he

 Former Zimbabwean team player and current batting coach Grant Flower has also confessed this
 unka kahana he, 'zimbabwe cricket kaaphi mushkil halaat se guzar rahaa he, ham kaaphi sangharsh kar rahe hai or main yah nahin bataa saktaa he ki hamaara yah mushkil daur kab khatm hoga
 He said that if this round goes on continuously, our team will soon lose its identity

 On the other hand, the captain of the Zimbabwe team and other cricketers of his team are neither paid any match fees nor any allowance
 iske alaava sabase badi baat ye he ki zimbabwe ke khilaadiyon ko kabhi bhi samay se bhugtan nahin kiya jaataa he
 According to the report of English newspaper Indian Express, a player of Zimbabwe team has a debt of $ 1500 on the board there

 The era of atal-advani had begun even before the BJP was founded in 1980

 The Jana Sangh was a highly committed and disciplined union of workers in many parts of the country and it became headless after Upadhyay's assassination
 aise main usko nae netaa kii jarurat thi
 Vajpayee, the rising star of Indian politics, stepped forward for this Daromdar
 lekin unhen party ke mishan main madad karne ke liye ek sakasham sahyogi kii jarurat thi
 a little shy, fast-paced Advani came forward for it with a strong resolve
 1980 ke dashak ke uttarardh main or '90 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main, ayodhya main ram mandir ke punarnirmaan ke liye jan andolan kaa netritv karke adwani ne bhartiya raajnneeti kii disha or shabdaawalee, donon main bada badlaav laa diya
 Advani's Rath Yatra for the purpose of constructing the Ram temple received such a huge response from Hindus that it troubled the opponents of the BJP, then Advani himself was surprised
 afsos kii baat he ki is andolan par adwani kii pakad nahin rahi or jisaki vajah se deshbhar main bade paimaane par sampradayik hinsa hui
 Through the Ayodhya movement, Advani led his party to awe-inspiring electoral success and challenged the congress-left standards and the practice of secularism
 unhone ise chhadam dharmanirpekshata kaha or iske pratyuttar main bhaajapa ke alag kism kii sakaaratmak dharmanirpekshata kaa naaraa buland kiya—''sabko nyaay, tushtikaran kisi kaa nahin''
 But on this standard, the success of the BJP raises questions
 bhartiya musalamaanon ke vanchit virgon ke saamaajik-aarthik nyaay ko sunishchit karne ke liye ek samgr drushti or vyaavhaarik nitiyon ko taiyaar karne main bhaajapa vifal rahi he
 And Advani will have to share this charge
 ab chijen is had tak kharaab ho gai hai ki bhaajapa bahusnkhyakon par apni kamyaabi tak hi simit he
 She does not talk of secularism which is the main support of the idea of india

 But as soon as the child was brought for operation, he started having trouble breathing
 subodh kaa aarope he ki doctoron kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se aisa hua he

 jaise hi usko oparation theatre le gaye or fracture kii jagah par thodaa-sa chira laga, bachche ko saans lene main problem hone lagi
 Then the doctor gave him an injection of magnesium, but after a few days again the child's condition started to worsen

" jis doctor ko bachche kii dekharekh ke liye rakhaa gaya he, ve abhi tak ek baar bhi dekhne nahin aae

 Talk to them to know what kind of trial has taken place
 kis prakaar se use jabardastee kanfeshan liya gaya
 Pakistan was repeatedly asked to know all this

 Counselor Access is a right of India due to being signatory in the Vienna Treaty and Pakistan is bound to accept that right
 usee vajah se antarrashtriya adaalat ne jadhav kii faansee par roak lagaai he
 Pakistan will have to give the basis of how all this has been done
 agar pakistan par vienna sandhi lagu he, to military court desh kii hoti he jab desh par hi lagu ho jaataa he to military or desh alag alag nahin ho sakate
 Minister of State PP Chaudhary says that the Vienna Convention is applicable to the country
 is desh main military bhi hoti he usamen karypalika bhi hoti he sansad bhi hoti he or nyaaypalika bhi hoti he
 The rules of the treaty apply to all
 agarbharat main vienna sandhi ke niyam lagu hai to pakistanper bhi lagu hote hai
 If Pakistan withdraws from this, it is not right
 'tripal talaak par SC kare faisla'teen talaak ke mudde par pi pi choudhary kaa kahana he ki agar supreme court tripal talaak ko nirast kar detaa he
 So how much is there to regulate
 marij and devorce uskaa jo kanoon he
 If Polly also decides Gamey's case in the Supreme Court
 ham to chaahate hai ki saare maamle tay ho janaa chahie
 If there is no grinding mill
 kyonki muslim mahilaon ko bahanon ko bhi samanta kaa desh main adhikaar he
 He further said that the Constitution of India has given him the right to equality
 personal lau ne bhale hi naa diya ho kii tripal talaak personal lau kii ketegory main aata he
 But even if it comes, there is no personal law which cannot be on the Constitution of India
 bharat kii samvidhan kii manshaa ke khilaaf nahin ho saktaa
 The Indian Constitution has given him the right to equality
 vah gender injustise kii baaten nahin karte hai
 Gender speaks of justice
 rajya mantri pi pi choudhary kaa kahana he ki isliye kisi tarah kaa supreme court aadesh detaa he or tripal talaak nirast karata he
 So the Government of India will bring a law regarding polygymy and triple divorce by the ordinance, because the Parliament is not running yet
 abhi supreme court tripal talaak kaa maamla maamla or poligami, ek se zyada shaadiyaan karne kaa maamla lambit he
 If triple divorce happens once, if he wants to marry the same person then he has to marry another
 waapas use dwaara shaadi kar sakate hai
 All this matter is pending before the Supreme Court
 unhonen aage kaha ki bharat sarkaar kaa to maananaa yah he ki saare maamlo par supreme court apana faisla suna de
 So that the government will have the facility to bring the law together
 agar tripal talaak ko hi deal kiya
 So we will be able to bring laws only on triple talaq
 agar teen talaak or poli gami ko ek saath karen to marij and divorce donon kaa ek saath kampojit ek kanoon aa jayega
 We believe that this will be good for the society as well as the Muslim women and daughters
