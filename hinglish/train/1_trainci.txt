 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has been accused of 'caged parrot' from the Supreme Court, is not in favor of giving independence easily
 desh kii pramukh jaanch agency ne sarkaar se do suvidhaayen pradaan kiye jane kii maang adaalat main rakhi, jiskaa sarkaar ke vakil ne purajor virodh kiya
 The CBI, in its plea before the Supreme Court bench hearing the coal block allocation case, had said that its director should have the same ex-officio powers as the secretary to the government so that the director can directly contact the Ministry of Personnel without getting entangled in the trap of naval bureaucracy
 sheersh adaalat ne mangalvaar ko sarkaar se sibiai kii daleelon par apana paksh rakhane ke liye kaha
 The court asked the government to clarify its position on the cbi's plea that the agency had sought the right of the independent agency to represent the director of the investigating agency to represent him before the courts
 sarkaar kii ore se pairvi karte hue solisitor general mohan parasharan ne sibiai kii donon daleelon kaa purajor virodh kiya
 He said, "it would be against the administrative spirit
 
 This will indicate wrong

 The CBI has been given a lot of powers
 " The CBI opposed the government's claims
 sibiai kii ore se pesh varisht vakil amrendra sharan ne adaalat se kaha, "ham aparimit shaktiyon kii baat nahin kar rahe hai
 We are accountable to the government
 yah lalaphitaashahee kii puraani dharna he
 If the bureaucracy is controlled in large numbers, then it will increase the operational efficiency
 " On Sharan's assertion that all political constituents of the country aspire to control the CBI, Justice RM Lodha said, "there is a consensus among all political parties on this front
 " During the hearing on the coal block allocation case in May this year, the Supreme Court had expressed displeasure over the 'investigation' by the ministers and bureaucrats of the status report before appearing in the court and the CBI was called a 'locked in parrot' Speaks the language of its owner
 adaalat ne sibiai ke kaamkaaj main raajnneetik hastkshep par aitraaj jataate hue sarkaar se jaanch agency ko swatantraaa pradaan karne ke liye kaha tha or kaha tha ki yadi sarkaar isamen chookti he to adaalat yah kaam karegi
 It is noteworthy that due to the tough stand of the court, the then Law Minister of the Central Government Ashwani Kumar had to resign from the post due to 'editing' the status report on the coal block allocation investigation

 purv vidhayakon ne ye bhi kaha ki 7 se zyada baar khat likh kar pradesh mukhyamantri se milane kaa samay maanga gaya lekin ek baar bhi unka jawaab nahin aayaa
 Former mlas say that the organization of more than 400 former mlas of Gujarat wrote to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and asked for time to meet
 mukhyamantri ne vakt to diya nahin lekin khat kaa jawaab bhi nahin diya
 Babu Bhai Shah, chairman of the council of former legislators, said that if the former mlas are given pension in other states, then why not the former mlas in Gujarat? On this matter, Babu Bhai said that the government was looking at the inflation of the state legislators and ministers The salary has been increased, but the former mlas have not been increased
 is par unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki aisa pakshpaat kyon kiya jaataa he, ye baat samaj nahin aa rahi
 He also said that former mlas were also public servants in olden times, they have also worked for the people honestly and it is not that they are not mlas then they do not work for the public

 It should be decided by making a high level committee, who should be given how much pension
 iske alaava state transport or sarkari aspataal main muft suvidha milani chahie
 An appeal has been made to the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs to revisit the facilities given to former mlas and to reconsider their ill-treatment at the earliest

 The BJP had already made preparations to make a dent in the Opposition's 'bharat Bandh' plan against demonetisation, on Monday the BJP started trying to thwart the planned shutdown on the streets of Delhi
 conot place ke inner cirkil main bijepi kii mahila morcha kii sainkadon kaaryakarta notebandi ke samarthan main utar aayin, haathon main takhtiyaan or tirangaa jhanda liye in mahilaon ne puure inner cirkil ke kai chakkar lagaae
 The motive was to make the atmosphere of the bandh cool and to keep the atmosphere warm in support of demonetisation
 haalanki conot place inner cirkil kii lagbhag sabhi dukaane khuli hui thi, to isse pradarshnkaree mahilaon kaa hausala or bad gaya, in mahilaon ne march ke dauraan khub narebaaji kii
 In the battle of black money, in the company of Modi ji, with this slogan, not only the shopkeepers but also the customers were trying to garner support in March
 bijepi kaa nahin liya jhandanotbandi ke modi sarkaar ke faisle ke samarthan main bijepi ne march nikaala to sahi, lekin ranneeti ke tahat bijepi mahila morcha ne haathon main bijepi kaa na to koi jhanda liya or na hi binar par bijepi ke naam kaa istemaal kiya
 The motive behind this strategy was to give the message to the people that the general public is against the decision of bandh and the businessman also wants to keep his shops open under the spirit of the common man, not the BJP
 mahilaayein kyon utari sadak parabijepi ke samarthan march main sirf mahila morcha kii kaaryakarta hin shaamil hui, purush netaaon ko is march se dur rakhaa gaya
 So that the acceptance of women in support of demonetisation can be stated
 yahi nahin is march ke jariye party ne piem modi ke faisle ke samarthan main mahilaon ko lamaband karne kii koshish bhi kii gai
 Patriotic support: In March, these women of SEJP held national flag ie tricolor instead of party flag in their hands, meaning bjp's attempt to link demonetisation support with patriotism
 bijepi ke naaron or takhtiyon par likhe sandesh main bhi yahi cheez najar aa rahi thi
 BJP Mahila Morcha president Kamaljeet Sehrawat said that his efforts are to bring out the feelings of common people, as they are getting the support of both businessmen and citizens
 bijepi dilli pradesh ikai kii mahaamantri rekha gupta ne kaha ki vipaksh logon ko gumraah kar rahaa he or wo is march ke jariye logon ko bataane kii koshish kar rahi he ki vipaksh kaledhan waalon ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahaa he

 vidambnaa to dekhiesath hi world toilet de bhi he
 Now you can understand how miserable is the condition of men
 'purush pradhan samaaj' shabd kii aad main purushon ko chaahe jitna kos liya jaae
 But the only problem is with men
 sabase pehle to jamaane bhar kii chintaaen inhen hi hoti hai
 At the time when women are getting emotional on TV serial's farewell to their daughter-in-law's fourth marriage, the men are eyeing Putin's war ships
 urad ke bhav giren yaa neuyork exange main daam ghate yaa badhen, asar purushon par hota he
 If there are elections somewhere, consider it a disaster and if there are football matches in the second timezone, then sleep is gone
 yahi nahin kadam-kadam par purushon ko samjhaute bhi karne padate hai
 Have to kill kabhi sahi fitting ke kapade nahin milte to kabhi sahi rang ke juute
 Make a lot of effort from home, but finally bring black shoes and oversize check shirt
 in par julm kii intihaan dekhie ki koi purush chaahe 104 degree bukhaar main bas yaa train main khadaa ho use koi seat nahin detaa
 On the other day, if the same man does not leave the seat for a well-to-do woman, then the world stares from the eyes that are eating
 kabhi aapane kisi mahila ko biimaar purush ke liye seat chhodte dekha he?prakruti ne bhi hamaare saath kam anyaay nahin kiya he
 The first one made us color blind
 jab saath main shopping par gai bivi yaa garlfriend baby pink, torkiese, magenta, seleman main dubi hoti hai to nazren kahin laal-nile ko khoj rahi hoti hai
 Left raw to calculate the second
 iskaa pataa khaanaa banaate vakt chalata he
 Ask women how much rice to make two men
 kitna pani daalen kab tak pakaaen? to jawaab aata he, chaar mutthi chaaval, chaaval se teen angul upar tak pani or ek siti baja kar band kar do
 Now assuming this calculation is correct, if you go to cook rice, neither the rice will be right nor the water and whistle will go when the rice is burnt to ashes
 purush bechaare to kisi se dushmani tak nahin paalate
 On the contrary, women are also saved from the shadow of a woman who asks their age or to wear earrings like them, while the men also look at someone wearing their own type of shirt
 kehete hai aurat kii sabase badi dushman aurat hoti he par sach to ye he ki purushon kaa sabase bada dushman purush khud hota he
 There are also those men who participate in all the sins, who give four feet congratulations on Women's Day, but do not even do four line messages on Men's Day
 is baar kaa purush diwas samarpit un sabhi purushon ko jo apni shaadi kii saalagirah tak to yaad nahin rakh pate or jinhen purush diwas bhi yaad na rahaa hoga

 gudgaanv police ne ek aise shaatir haikar ko giraftaar kiya he, jo company kaa sarwar hack kar graahakon ko lakhon rupayon kii chapat laga chukaa tha
 The vicious hacker was on the run after fleeing crores to several more customers
 magar uskaa plan mukammal hone se pehle hi police ne use giraftaar kar liya
 No matter how vicious the crime is, the hands of the law reach the culprit
 asipi harvinder singh ke mutabik, home credit india finance privet company ke ek purv karmchaaree kamalkant urf sunil (20 varsh) kodhokhadhadior farjivada kar graahakon ke acounts se lakhon rupee apane acount main transfar karne ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The company alleges that one of his customers had lodged a complaint with the authorities that the loan amount did not come into his account even after the bank loan was approved
 jiske baad company ne apana record check kiya to paaya ki 7 acounts aise the, jo unke graahakon se sambandhit nahin the
 One of these accounts was found to be of Kamalkant, a former employee of the company
 company ke adhikariyon ko puraa maajaraa samajhane main der na lagi
 Kamalakant first hacked the company server of Tofarjeevadkar and then transferred the loan amount sanctioned by the customer to his account
 isi tarah vah company ke 185 anya graahakon ke acounts se takreeban 1 karod 6 lakh rupee jo abhi manjuur nahin hue the, hadapney kii firaaq main tha
 At present, the police are arresting Kamalakant and questioning him
 bhartiya loktantr kaa sabase bada utsav 11 april ko pehle charan ke saath shuru gaya or isamen daanv bahut oonche lage hue hai
 The election of such a fierce rivalry has not been seen before
 91 siton ke liye pehle charan main matdaan kamobesh 2014 kii tarah hi hua
 There was no outrage or anger in the eight seats of UP
 pehle charan kii siton main pichley loksabhaa chunaav bhaajapa nit neshnal democratic elliance kaa palada baari rahaa kyonki usne inamen se ek tihaai se zyada siten jiti thim
 In this phase, the future of two important leaders in terms of future politics has closed in EVM
 pehle hai bhaajapa diggaj kendriya mantri nitin gadakari or duusare andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu
 Naidu is not contesting the Lok Sabha elections, but in the event of a hung Lok Sabha, the results of Andhra Lok Sabha seats and Naidu's strategy will definitely have an impact
 iske liye naidu kii tidipi kaa vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav main behatar pradarshan karnaa jaruri hoga
 In the event of no party getting majority in the center, both of these names have also been tossed for the post of Prime Minister
 pehle charan kii 32 siten 2014 main bhaajapa ne jabaki congress ne 6 siten jiti hai
 BJP came second in 6 seats and Congress in 38 seats
 bhaajapa 16 siton par 1 lakh se kam voton ke antar se jiti or congress ne sabhi 6 siton par jeet1 lakh se kam voton ke antar se jeetin
 However, there was no Grand Alliance in the 2014 elections
 uttarapradesh kii aath siton main se 6 siton main gathbandhan (sapa-basapa-areldi) ke pratyaashiyon ko 2014 main mili maton ke pratishat kaa yoga bhi bhaajapa ke jite ummidavaar ke vot pratishat se kam baithta he
 The percentage of votes polled by the candidates of the alliance is Ghaziabad 11 per cent, Gautam Buddha Nagar 26 per cent, Meerut 29 per cent, Saharanpur 17 per cent, Muzaffarnagar 26 per cent and Kairana 34 per cent
 do siton bijanour (34) or bagpat (36) main gathbandhan ke pratyaashiyon ko mili maton ke pratishat kaa yoga bhaajapa ke vijeta pratyaashee ke vot percentage se zyada rahaa
 Only in Saharanpur in 2014, BJP won by a margin of less than one lakh
 baaki sabhi main jeet kaa antar 1 lakh se zyada rahaa
 VK Singh of BJP 5 in Ghaziabad
 67 lakh ke antar se congress ke raaj babbar ko haraaya tha
 Out of 91 of the first phase in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, more than 80 per cent of the polling was held in 23 seats, the highest being 87 in Nagaland
 82 fisadi or tripura main 85
 The turnout was 92 percent
 in 23 main 11 andhra pradesh kii or 3 telugana kii hai
 In the first phase, 47 seats have polled more than 75 percent
 91 siton main 70 se 80 fisadi matdaan vaali kul 33 siten hai jinamein se sabase zyada assam kii dibrugarh seat par 79
 The turnout was 25 percent
 60 se 70fisadi matdaan vaali 15 siten raheen
 These include 69 in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra
 95 fisadi matdaan hua
 There are 15 seats with 50 to 60 percent polling and these include the four of Bihar i
e
 Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada and Jamui
 pehle charan main sabase kam matdaan vaali seat kashmir kii baraamula he jahaan 2014 main39
 The turnout was 13 percent
 2014 kaa chunaav tab kii sarkaar ke ghotaalon, bhrashtachar, mahangaai or kushasan ke khilaaf ladaa gaya tha
 There were strong movements against the government like Lokpal and civil society rose up
 congress ke netritv vaali tab kii upie sarkaar ke karnadhaaron ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladane waalon ko chunaav maidan main utarane kii chunauti di or isse arvind kejariwal ke netritv vaali aam aadmi party astitv main ai
 The Nirbhaya scandal, which took place about one and a half years before the 2014 elections, shook the entire country and intensified discussions on women safety started inside and outside the government
 upie sarkaar ko sakht kanoon bhi bananaa padaa
 Deep dissatisfaction in the public then Narendra Modi, who was the Chief Minister of the BJP government in Gujarat, went ahead and launched the campaign
 modi ne hoshiyaari se maahaul ko apane paksh main kar liya
 Later it was called Modi wave and after 30 years at the center, a single party majority government was formed
 lekin is baar mudde or maahaul bilkul alag he
 Narendra Modi's absolute majority government did not allow inflation to become an issue
 bhrashtachar ke maamle main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel deal par bahes chhedakar mudda banane kaa prayaas kiya lekin chunaav kii dahalij par pahunchakar khud hi is mudde ko pehle to chhod diya par supreme court ke aadesh ke baad phir ise uthaa liya
 That is, Rahul continued to hesitate a little
 notebandi modi sarkaar kaa vivaadaaspad faisla rahaa he lekin vipaksh ise vyapak janandolan kii shakl nahin de paaya
 Except for the problems of the farmers, opposition could not surround the government on any other issue at the national level
 berogari badi lekin vipakshi partiyaan usko lekar sadak par utarkar teevr virodh main nahin badal saki hai
 The election results will be known only to the extent to which the suffering of the unemployed and farmers will go against the government
 pehle charan main sabase bada imtihaan dakshin main modi virodh kaa jhanda uthaae andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu or unki party tidipi kaa hone ja rahaa he
 The first phase of voting will decide whether the next PM will be formed from south or there will be assembly elections along with Lok Sabha
 pichley yani 2014 ke chunaav main andhra pradesh main jaganmohan kii viesarsipi 17, tidipi 6 or bhaajapa 2 siton main duusare sthaan par rahi
 Apparently this time Naidu is facing the anti-incumbency trend and Jagan has strengthened his grip with constant election campaigning
 viesarsipi tidipi ko nuksaan pahunchane kii sthiti main he or isse naidu na keval pichad jaaenge balki rashtriya raajnneeti main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane ke unke sapane ko bhi dhakka lag saktaa he
 In Andhra, 77 per cent voting is being reported which may be a matter of concern for Naidu, who is struggling with anti-incumbency
 naidu ke liye vidhansabha or loksabhaa donon chunaavon main number hasil karnaa chunauteepurn bana hua he
 In Telangana, around 61 percent of the turnout can be seen as a sign of relief for the TRS
 
 The ruling trs's k Chandrasekhar Rao in the neighboring state of Telangana too is now seeing his role in Delhi politics through the Lok Sabha election performance after winning a landslide in the assembly elections
 telugana main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress 11 siton main duusare sthaan par rahi jabaki tiares ne 10 siten jiti thim
 TDP won 1 seat and stood second in 3 seats in the state
 yahaan tiares kaa mukhya muqabla congress se hi rahaa he
 The situation on the ground has not changed much and the TRS seems to repeat its performance but national elections are contested on a different pitch, so waiting for the results on May 23 will be fine
 pehle charan ke matdaan se jo sanket mili hai unamem sabase mahatvapurn ye he ki kisi party ke paksh or vipaksh main koi lahar nahin dikh rahi he
 The turnout percentage is not shocking which suggests that voters are not enthusiastic
 isse ekatarfa janadesh kii sambhaavna nahin dikhti he

 Both of you lived these moments of friendship
 lekin in dinon aapaki best friend aapse kati-kati rahati he
 It is not that she has got any other close friends but she is just getting away from you
 haalanki aapke boyfriend se uskiacchhi dostihai or uske saamne vah hameshaa yah jataane kii koshish karti he ki vah aapse behatar he
 If so, know that his heart has fallen on your boyfriend
 in tareekon se jaane ki kya vah aapke boyfriend par mar-miti he :1
 Suddenly his behavior has changed with you
 vah aapse dur rahati he or bina kisi baat ke ukhd jaati he
 Especially when you tell her about good moments with your boyfriend
 2
 While talking, his eyes are fixed on your boyfriend
 aksar vah usase haath mila leti he, uske kandhe par jhul jaati he yaa phir usase baat karte hue apane baalo se khelti rahati he
 It is better for you to understand his body language in time and manage your relationship
 3
 Often she misses your boyfriend for help or advice and forgets to tell you about it
 haalanki iske liye uske paas koi thos vajah nahin hoti
 4
 aap donon ne use coffee yaa lunch ke liye saath bulaayaa
 You thought you would enjoy together
 lekin yah kya
 
 
 It was more fun to show your friend down than the lunch menu
 jaan len ki yah aapke liye jabadarast warning he
 5
 kuch samay pehle tak usko mechap main dilchaspee nahin thim lekin aajkal vah luks par bahut dhyaan detii he
 Not only this, she often compares herself and who feels better
 6
 There is a change in the way he sits
 aapke boyfriend ko dekhte hivah qamar sidhi kar leti he, taange cross karke baithti he or uskaa cheharaa aapke boyfriend ke kaaphi kareeb hota he
 7
 agar ye tareeke kaaphi na hon to uski hansi par gaur karen
 In this way, she will speak slowly and laugh but in the presence of your boyfriend, her laugh will not stop
 choti-choti baaten bhi use bade chutkule kii tarah lagengi or uski hansi bhi oonchi aawaaj main hogi

 Most of the candidates are from these categories
 saharanpur kii gangoh seat ko chhodkar, party ne jin 12 siton par pratyaashiyon ke naam kii ghoshnaa kii he, unamem aadhe brahman-muslim chehre hai
 It is believed that after the break-up in the Lok Sabha elections with the Samajwadi Party, the BSP is once again trying to increase its base under the social engineering formula
 basapa kii koshish he ki brahman card ke jariye bhartiya janata party(bijepi) main or muslim card ke jariye sapa ke votbank main sendhamari kar apana janaadhar badhaayaa jaae
 Political analysts believe that the BSP, which won 10 seats against the sp's 5 in the Lok Sabha elections, may get Muslim votes, but it will not be easy to make a dent in the core Brahmin vote bank of the BJP, which is in the most strong phase
 13 siton main philhal hamirpur ko lekar hi chunaav ayog ne adhisuchana jari kii he

 The BJP leader wrote this letter to Delhi Lt Governor Tejinder Khanna and Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee Chairman Suresh Kalmadi
 narendra modi kii tajposhi se pehle phir ruth gaye hai adwani
 According to sources, Advani is adamant that Modi's name should be announced after December
 modi ke naam par etraj karne waalon main murali manohar joshi bhi hai
 BJP President Rajnath Singh was busy trying to convince him
 mulaakaat ke dauraan joshi ne kaha ki modi ke naam kaa elaan karne se pehle bijepi shasit un rajyon se sahmati lee jaani chahie, jahaan chunaav hone vaale hai
 Advani's resentment has come heavily on the party amid Modi's coronation in the political vortex
 ek din pehle gadakari or ab rajnath singh ke manaane par bhi wo nahin maane
 However, despite his displeasure in Goa, the announcement of Modi's name was proved that Modi has traveled to Delhi
 ab to sangh kii taraf se bhi modi ko hari jhandi mil chuki he
 But bypassing Advani in the party will not be easy
 sushamaa swaraj, murali manohar joshi, anant kumaar jaise kai diggaj unke saath hai
 LK Advani did not agree on Modi's name! Bihar BJP leaders are also among the advocates of Modi's name
 yahaan tak ki susheel kumaar modi iske liye laalkrishna adwani par bhi nishaanaa saadhane se nahin chuke
 Sushil Modi has tweeted that Advani could not foresee the mood of the people
 adwani ji ne khud hi atalji ko piem ghoshit kiya tha
 Now they should do the same for Narendra Modi
 bihar bijepi ke netaa seepi thakur ne bhi kaha he ki 13 sitambar ko bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main modi ke naam kii ghoshnaa ho jaani chahie
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the Economic Advisory Committee to bring the staggering economy back on track
 aaj uski pehali baithak hui
 After the meeting, the Economic Advisory Committee said that the imf's projection had been wrong even before
 IMF global parameter ke aadhaar par akalan karata he, hamaara kaam karne kaa tarika alag he
 The committee said that we discussed the issues which were sent to us by the PM
 lekin ham khud bhi muddon par charchaa karenge, ham sirf piem ko hi apni chintaaen bataaenge
 Our goal is to increase the growth of the economy, which means we have to keep a close watch on it
 bibek debaroy ne kaha ki hamaare saamne badi chunauti he ki agle bajet ke liye kya salaah den
 In the first meeting, we have selected 10 core sectors, on which a detailed report has been prepared
 hamaara makasad sirf piem ko salaah dene kaa he
 We will be meeting once again in November
 jin sectoron ko chunaa gaya he wo hai
 
 
 - Economic Growth - Job Creation and Growth - Informal Sector - Monetary Policy - Institution of Economic Governance - Farming - On the issue of Social Sector Job Creation, the Committee says that the data released by Labor Bureau and Corporate is not a correct growth Can tell ye job market kii sirf 1-1
 5% growth is able to tell
 ham asli report NSS se maangenge, NSS ke paas abhi 2010-11 kaa data he
 But we are waiting for new data of 2018

 It has been decided after the meeting that Ratan Vatal will serve as the Secretary of the Growth

 Significantly, after steps like demonetisation and GST, the GDP figures in the first quarter of FY 2017-18 have pushed the Modi government to the backfoot
 vipaksh ke saath-saath ghar main se bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthi thi
 The biggest challenge before this committee will be how to improve the figures
 bijepi ke diggaj yashavanth sinha, arun shouri ne notebandi, jiesti ko arthvyavastha ke girane kaa kaaran bataaya tha
 However, PM Modi himself said in a program that there is no need to worry, the economy is strong

 Recently, Nikhil Advani, the director of the film d Day for Arjun Rampal, did something similar
 arjuna ke role ko asal jindagi ke kareeb laane ke liye nikhil ne unke liye andheri stesan ke baahar se kapade kharide
 Arjun says about this, "nikhil's idea of buying clothes from Andheri station market was more
 jisase film main dikhaai ja rahi sichuation ko or adhik dam mili
 i also found these shoes in a second hand store in Istanbul which i found absolutely attractive
 jaise unka koi puraa ek itihaas ho

 mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kaa 'bhagya' karnataka ke ran main tej chamak rahaa he
 Siddaramaiah seems to have achieved success with his well-being welfare schemes
 ye congress chhatrap isi 'bhagya' kii siddhi ke dam par modi-shah ke vijay rath ko karnataka main rokane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 According to an exit poll conducted for India Today by India's most successful 'axis My India', the Congress is going to emerge as the largest party in Karnataka
 siddharmaiya ke 'bhagya' ke aage itihaas-bjp donon pastegsit pole ke mutabik congress ko karnataka main 106-118 seat milane ja rahi hai
 On Saturday, polling was held for 222 seats in the 224-member assembly of Karnataka
 karnataka vidhaan saudh (vidhansabha) main bahumat kaa jaadui aankada 113 he
 Since polling has been held for 222 seats so far, 112 seats are needed for the majority
 exis ke anumaan ke mutabik congress anti inkambency par aasaani se paar pate hue karnataka main lagaataar duusari baar sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 No party has won the state elections twice in a row since 1985
 1985 main ramakrishna hegade ke netritv main janata party dobaaraa chunaav jitkar satta main ai thi
 Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's main reason for emerging as the Congress winner in Karnataka has been to practice caste equations
 siddharmaiya alpsankhyakon, pichhadi jatiyon or daliton (AHINDA) ko milakar bada jaateey gathbandhan banane main kaamyaab rahe
 The BJP managed to prevent a dent in its Lingayat vote bank, but could not weave a big social alliance that would beat Siddaramaiah's AHINDA formula
 BJP kii ummid ke mutabik nahin chalaa reddy bros cardegsit pole ke aankade bataate hai ki is chunaav main aisa koi ek mudda yaa trend nahin rahaa jo karnataka ke sabhi 6 kshetron main samaan rup se prabhavi rahaa
 In Karnataka, each region has its own special voting method due to its unique mood
 hyderabad karnataka main congress shandaar pradarshan karte hue 40 main se 33 seat par jeet hasil karti najar aa rahi he
 Hyderabad Karnataka has 6 districts including Bellary, where BJP gave 8 tickets to the infamous Reddy brothers and their allies
 agsit pole ke aankade bataa rahe hai ki reddy card vaisaa nahin chal paaya jaisaa ki bijepi ne ummid lagaai thi
 The Congress performed well in Deve Gowda's stronghold Congress has also done well in the Old Mysore (south Karnataka) region
 is kshetra kii 64 siton main se congress ko 33 siton ke milane kaa anumaan he
 According to the exit poll's big conclusion, it seems that Muslims in South Karnataka have overwhelmingly voted for the Congress
 puraane mysore main muslim vot congress or janata dal secular (JDS) main banta jarur, lekin exis kaa data bataata he ki 77 fisadi muslimon ne congress ke paksh main vot daale
 The JDS received traditional Vokkaligga (54%) votes in these seats, but the party failed to get additional votes from Muslims and Dalits
 agar aisa ho paata to party jo kshetra devegoda kaa garh mana jaataa rahaa he vahaan acha pradarshan dikhaa sakati thi
 The bjp's position on 64 seats in Old Mysore region has never been stronger in the past
 aise main bijepi kii ranneeti kaa sara daanv is par tikaa tha ki is kshetra main JDS achche se acha pradarshan kare
 Congress seems to get the direct benefit of the jds's condition here
 agar yahaan JDS majboot rahati to sthiti ulat sakati thi
 According to BJP forward Axis in Bombay Karnataka and Central Karnataka, BJP seems to be doing well in Bombay Karnataka and Central Karnataka
 bombai karnataka kii 50 main se 30 siton par camel khilne kaa anumaan he
 Similarly, 14 out of the 23 seats in central Karnataka are estimated to go to the BJP account
 shahari siton par bhi congress ko badhategsit pole se ek ahm baat ye bhi nikal kar ai he ki congress karnataka kii shahari siton par acha pradarshan karne main kaamyaab rahi he
 This situation is different from the elections held in Gujarat last year
 vahaan shahari kshetron main maat khaane kii vajah se kaante ke mukaable main congress bijepi se pighad gai thi
 In the urban pockets of the Bengaluru metropolis, the Congress seems to be gaining an edge over the BJP
 bengalooru kii 26 seat main se congress ko 15 or bijepi ko 10 seat milane kaa anumaan he
 Out of the total urban votes of Karnataka, Congress is seen getting 41% and BJP 37%
 costal karnataka main dhruvikaran kaa BJP ko phaaydacostal karnataka yaa tateey karnataka wo kshetra he, jahaan sampradayik hatyaon ke mudde ko bijepi ne jorshor se uthaaya tha
 Here, the BJP accused the Siddaramaiah government that it remained a mute spectator on the killing of 24 BJP and RSS workers
 costal karnataka ke 3 jilon main uttar kannada, dakshin kannada or udupi aate hai
 There was intense polarization on religious grounds in these three districts
 ye sthiti bijepi ko chunavi laabh detii najar aa rahi he
 Of the 19 seats here, 13 are estimated to go to the BJP account
 30 seat par jeet kaa antar 2% se comeexis maay india ke anumaan ke mutabik karnataka kii 30 seat aisi he, jahaan jeet kaa antar 2% se kam rah saktaa he
 These 30 seats will decide whether the Congress easily crosses the majority mark or lags behind in achieving it
 congress kaa jaateey gathbandhan formula BJP par bharijahan tak jaateey aadhaar par vot share kaa sawaal he to agsit pole se dilachasp nishkarsh nikal kar aae hai
 80% Muslims, 61% Kurba, 43% tribal, 48% Dalit votes have gone in favor of Congress
 inhone hi siddharmaiya ke liye majboot aadhaar taiyaar kiya
 If all these communities are merged, then they constitute 47% of the total population of Karnataka
 duusari taraf bijepi ko karnataka ke lingayat samudaay main 62% , brahmanon main 66%, ati pichhadaa varg (OBC) 49% or anya savarna jatiyon main 52% vot milane ja rahe hai
 This ethnic alliance of BJP constitutes 41% of the total votes of Karnataka
 karnataka kii ek anya prabhavi savarna jati vokkaligga he jisaki hissedari pradesh kii kul aabaadi main 11% he
 Of the total votes of the Vokkaligga community of the state, 54% preferred to support their traditional leader HD Deve Gowda

 If you are asked to choose one in music, sex and food, then whom will you choose? khayr, yah to aapak nijee maamla he, lekin britain main kai log aise hai jinka maananaa he ki unhen sex ke bajaae acha sangeet sunne se khushi milti he
 Not only this, people have preferred chocolate over sex
 britain main 2000 purush or striyon ke bich kara gaye ek pole main 40 fisadi logon ne kaha ki ve mood acha karne ke liye apane pasandida gane sunate hai, jabaki 20 fisadi ne sex ko chunaa
 Not only this, the people involved in the survey took the name of chocolate to please themselves more than romantic moments
 pole main logon ne mujeec, chocolate or sex ko kramash: pehle, duusare or tisare number par rakhaa
 In this poll, women chose music rather than sex in comparison to men
 landan univarsity college main manovigyaan ke professor thomas chamoro kehete hai, 'sex ke prati stri or purush kaa najariya ek-duusare se kaaphi alag he
 While it is interesting for men, for women it is a matter of emotional engagement
 'chaahe log kisi ke saath rishte main ho yaa nahin phir bhi ve apane relationships states ko lekar pareshaan rahete hai
 According to Professor Thomas, 'choosing music is a selfish activity because it is only you and you
 ' The Union Budget 2017-18 for Modi government is full of challenges along with being historic
 1 march kii jagah 1 farvari ko pesh hone vaala aam bajet pehali baar rail bajet ko khud main shaamil karegaa
 At the same time, this will be the last budget of the Modi government, where tough decisions can be taken in the direction of important economic reforms
 aisa isliye ki 2019 main sarkaar aam chunaavon main jane ke liye mahaj antarim bajet degi or 2018 kaa bajet chunaavon ke chalate loklubhaavan hi hoga
 Therefore, this budget is giving the last chance to prepare a table of economic reforms for the Modi government which came to power by making policy paralysis and corruption issue in 2014
 modi sarkaar ke upar isbjatmen aarthik sudhaaron ko lagu karne or prabhavakaari nitiyon ko spasht karne kaa dabaav bhi he
 Due to this, the global rating agency will give rating to the Indian economy
 videshi nivesh par lage pratibandhon ko hataane, jiesti ko lagu karne or bankerpsi code kii prabhaavshaalee niti par aage badhaane se hi arthvyavastha sthir or vikaas kii disha main aage bad sakati he
 Therefore, know what is the last chance for the upcoming Budget Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to decide on the major reforms, the year's budget-gst- Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the biggest step of the Central Government towards tax reform
 sarkaar kii koshish bajet satr main jiesti ko amali-jama pehanaane kii he
 By September, the central government has to implement GST in any case
 kendra or rajyon ke bich ahm adhikaron kaa aavanton abhi bhi mudda bana hua he
 It is believed that the Central Government may still have to struggle for 4-5 months to implement it
 banking or tex riform- desh main 8 november ko notebandi lagu hone se pehle desh ke sarkari or nijee bainkon kaa ganda karj (non parforming asset-enpie) sabase bada mudda tha
 Demonetisation where 86 percent currency from economy (500, and about 15 in 1000 rupee currency
 4 lakh karod) ko baahar kar diya vahiin isamen se 14 lakh karod rupee bainkon main jamaa kiye ja chuke hai
 It is clear that almost the entire black money of the country has been deposited in the banking system
 ab sarkaar kii chunauti bainkon main jamaa paise kii jaanch karana he jisase kalaadhan jamaa karaane waalon se tex vasula ja sake
 Ease of Doing Business - The Central Government will have to increase the powers of the tax authorities to get all bank accounts checked by the Income Tax Department in the country
 iskaa sidhaa asar desh main ej of duing bijness index par padegaa
 At the same time, checking all the accounts of the bank will also increase the problems of the common man and will also create a deadlock in doing business in the country
 is faisle kaa apana raajnneetik nuksaan bhi he lekin sarkaar kaa sabase ahm aarthik sudhaar hone ke kaaran aagaamee bajet iske liye sabase upyukt he
 Subsidy - Important provision can be made in the upcoming budget to provide cheaper houses in rural areas and small towns
 iske liye piem modi ne is tabake ke liye karj par byaaj kam karne kii ghoshnaa pehle hi kar di he
 Now the government has appealed to banks to use excess liquidity from demonetisation for social welfare, including cheap houses and cheap loans for small businesses
 gauratlab he ki yah farmaan ek baar phir sarkaar kii manshaa sarkari khajaane se garib tabake ko sahaara dene kii he
 At the same time, for the economic boom in the country, it is necessary that the government should reduce the burden of subsidy at the earliest

 America will reach number three
 isliye appal samet kai america companiyaan asian bazaar par pakad banane ke liye bharat main nivesh karnaa chaahati he
 The Modi government has to take a decision to relax the existing FDI law to lure these investors
 jahaan june 2016 main modi sarkaar ne appal jaisi companiyon ko bharat aane kaa rasta kholte hue single brands ritel store kholane kii ijaajat di he
 Also, to promote Make in India, it has conditioned these companies to do 30 percent manufacturing in India

 chunki ham nae nahin he isliye shuruyaat or invest karne kii bhi zarurat nahin he'bayanon se saaf he ki jald hi customers ko mobile ke baari bharkam bill se nijaat milane vaali he

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of the cricket team that won India the World Cup title after 28 years, has also been placed above the US President Barack Obama and footballer Lionel Messi among Time magazine's most influential figures of the year 2010

 Apart from Dhoni, it also includes Mukesh Ambani (61), VS Ramachandran (79), Azim Premji (88) and Aruna Rai (89)
 dhoni ne is suchi main messi se oojagah banaai he, jo obama se ek sthaan neeche 87wein number par hai
 Google executive Vile Ghonim topped the list

 Time magazine praised Dhoni as a great captain

 He deserves it and has great confidence

 Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar has also made it to this list before Dhoni in Time magazine

 Even before the festive season starts, the government is on alert with the onion and sugar price rise
 agle maheene se durga puja, diwali or chhath jaise mahatvapurn tyohaar aane vaale hai
 Not only this, besides the festivals, in the coming months this year, assembly elections are also going to be held in many states
 lekin is bich khaastaur par pyaaj kii keemton ko lekar jis tarah se bazaar main achaanak oochaal aayaa he, usase sarkaar kii chintaa bad gai he
 While the average price of onion was Rs 15 to 20 per kg a month ago, onion has now reached Rs 40 per kg in the metropolitan retail market
 tamaam duusare shaharon main bhi pyaaj kii keemat 30 rupee kilo tak pahunch chuki he
 The government believes that onion production was good this year and there is no shortage of onion supply in the market, hence there may be a big reason for price rise
 isse pehle ki halaat kaabo se baahar hon, sarkaar ne iske liye kadam uthaanaa shuru kar diya he
 It is often the case that in case of price rise, the State Government and the Central Government begin to break the blame on each other's forehead
 isliye centre sarkaar ke khaadya or upabhokta mantralay ne faisla liya he ki rajyon ko is bare main chhot di jaae ki vah pyaaj kii stock limit apane yahaan kii jarurat or paristhitiyon ke hisaab se khud tay karen
 The Ministry has also issued an order in this regard
 ab rajya khud hi tay kar sakenge ki pyaaj ke liye stock kii seemaa kitni ho taaki usee hisaab se jamkhori or kalabazari se nipta ja sake or jamaakhoron ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja sake
 The government has also taken steps to control sugar prices
 tyoharon ke samay mithai kii maang kii vajah se chini kii khapat kaaphi bad jaati he
 The government has issued orders that the sugar mill owners will have to supply more sugar in the market in the months of September and October
 iske liye chini kaa stock limit tay kar diya gaya he
 In September, sugar mills can retain 21% of the total stock, while in the month of October, the sugar stock limit has been fixed at only 8%
 yani oktober ke maheene main chini milon ko chini utpaadan kaa lagbhag sara hissaa bazaar main supplai karnaa padegaa
 The government hopes that with the increase in supply, the precious ones will be kept under control
 iske alaava chini kii keemton par niyantran karne ke liye sarkaar chini aayaat karne par bhi vichaar kar rahi he
 It is possible that the import of 5 lakh tonnes of sugar may be decided soon
 vaise sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki desh main chini kii koi kami nahin he
 Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also tweeted that there is no shortage of sugar in the country for domestic consumption
 lekin sarkaar kii chintaa yah he ki pichley kai maheenon se khudara bazaar main chini kii keemat 45 rupee prati kilo par bani hui he

 However, despite joining hands with several regional parties in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP in Tamil Nadu was left unimpressed

 The manner in which BJP workers celebrated the birthday of party president Amit Shah on 22 October, there is resentment in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 sangh vyakti puja ke khilaaf he or aresas ke kuch netaaon kaa maananaa he ki janmdin ke jashn se vyakti puja ko badhaava mila
 Manmohan Vaidya said - According to the Sangh's ideology against Sangh Pooja, all its self-determination is equal
 amit shaahako janmdin par twitor ek video bhi aplod kiya tha, jisamen bijepi adhyaksh ko diggaj netaa ke taur par pesh kiya gaya
 On this matter, the All India propaganda head of the Sangh, Manmohan Vaidya said, 'the Sangh does not support individual worship
 lekin ye apni pasand kaa maamla he
 He said, 'but the BJP is an independent political party
 bhaajapa sangh to nahin
 'rajiv Tuli, the chief of Delhi province Prachara, of Congress-like culture in the BJP, spoke more openly in this matter
 unhone kaha, 'ab bijepi main bhi congress kii tarah ek nai samskruti ghus rahi he, jisamen vyakti puja ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 Sudarshan ji (former union chief) had said that there should be no focus on the person
 sangh kaa jhanda hi sarvocch he or usee kii puja honi chahie
 'BJP leaders defended, while some BJP leaders say that something different did not happen on Amit Shah's birthday, which does not happen on the birthday of other big leaders of the party
 in netaaon ne naam na chhapane kii guzarish karte hue kaha ki kaaryakartaaon ne party adhyaksh ke liye jo bhi pyaar or sammaan dikhaaya, use vyakti puja kahana thik nahin he
 The man, who runs the world's biggest party, featured Amit Shah sitting in a chair and pictures of Chanakya and Veer Savarkar in the background
 video main unhen stratgist ke taur par dikhaaya gaya
 The title of the video was- Know the man who leads the largest political party of the world (meet the man who runs the world's largest political party)
 rajd supremeo lalu prasad par bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara rahamaan ke gane jai ho kii tarj par kavita ke jariye kiye gaye kataaksh par lojpa pramukh ramvilas paswan ne chutki lete hue kaha ki rahamaan ke gane kii tarah hi nitish kii kavita bhi auskar award ke laayak he or use vahiin bhej diya janaa chahie
 On 22 September last, Nitish had said through the poem about the RJD supremo, "jai ho, jai ho, kayapalat ji hail, railways decay, fear in Bihar, Maha Terrorraj, Maharaj Kayakapalut ji , Jai Ho
 ‚Äô paswan ne nitish ke is bayaan par kaha ki rahamaan ke gane kii tarah hi nitish kii kavita bhi auskar award ke laayak he or use vahiin bhej diya janaa chahie
 Taking a dig at Nitish's statement about the ljp's bungalow election Chihla as a bungalow and being a mere rjd's cell, he alleged that his party, JDU itself, had long remained an RSS cell
 paswan ne nitish ke alpsankhyak prem ko maatr dikhaava bataate hue kaha ki agar unki party alpsankhyakon kii hitaishi hoti, to jammu-kashmir gaye sarvadaleey shishtmandal main anya dalon kii tarah unke bhi pratinidhi andolankaaree netaaon se bhent karne jate, lekin bhaajapa ke saath jadyu ke pratinidhi bhi unase nahin mili
 Accusing Nitish of breaking his party in the past, Paswan said about LJP MLA Izhar Ahmad joining JDU and Achuthanand in BJP, that JDU and BJP engaged in 'rejecting' people of his party
 Huh
 unhone pradesh main sattadhari rajg ke ghatak dal jadyu or bhaajapa main purv se anduruni kalah hone kaa aarope lagaate hue daawa kiya ki is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main jadyu bhaajapa ke ummidavaar or bhaajapa jadyu ke ummidavaar ko haraane kii firaaq main juty hui he
 Asked about the LJP releasing its list of candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, Paswan said it would be released soon by his party
 is avasar paswan kii upasthiti main bhaajapa ke purv bihar vidhaan parishad sadsy kapildev singh, jadyu ke pradesh mahasachiv raghavendra singh, nalanda jila ke harnaut se jadyu netaa arun bind or nalanda se congress netaa sudhir kumaar ne lojpa kii sadsyta grahan kii

 duusari taraf naveen sangeet ke dauraan apni pehali patni ronita ko bhi maarane kii koshish karte dikhe
 Contrary to the stringent laws made to protect women, there have been many cases of harassment of men, in which these laws became a cause of trouble for husbands
 kuch maamalon main to alam yah he ki patniyon dwaara shikaayat darj karaane ke baad patiyon ne sanyas hi le liya
 Many such cases have been reported in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke jabalpur jile main patniyon dwaara darj karai gai shikayaton ke baad beete paanch varsh main 4,500 pati aise faraar hue ki ab tak unka pataa hi nahin chal sakaa tathaa unamem se kai to sanyasi hi ban gaye
 Many wives who have become saints after wives enacted a law whip are offering prayers at Narmada coast and offering their services in temples
 mahilaon par badhate atyaacharon par ankush lagane ke liye centre se lekar pradesh str par sarkaron ne pichley varsho main kaaphi sajagata dikhaai or mahilaon ko suraksha evam unke adhikaron ko sangrakshan dene ke liye kai kade kanoon banaae or kai kanoonon main sanshodhan kar unhen sakht banaaya
 Due to this, women knock on the doors of the police even on trivial matters, due to which life is disturbed, family unrest also increases
 pati-patni ke bich vivaadon ke chalate parivaar tuutane va patiyon ke bhaag jane ke jo maamle jabalpur main aae hai, ve chaunkaane vaale hai
 Anshuman Shukla, counselor of the Family Counseling Center, said that about 4,500 husbands have been missing since the last five years of family dispute complaints in Jabalpur
 anshuman ne bataaya ki jo pati ghar chhod gaye hai, unamem se kai to sanyasi ban gaye hai
 Anshuman said that the complainant women have come and informed them about their husband becoming a monk
 anshuman ke mutabik patniyon dwaara darj karai jane vaali shikayaton ke baad giraftaar se bachane ke liye pati bhaag jate hai or aane vaali musiibat se bachane ke liye phir unke paas shesh jivan sanyasi banakar bitaane kaa hi vikalp rah jaataa he
 Troubled by the wife's complaint at the police station, Prakash Sahu says that his father has died recently and the wife lodged a complaint of harassment at the police station
 patni usase is shart par talaak chaahati he ki use iske evaj main rakam di jaae
 To avoid this situation, he is looking for a way that he can save himself from trouble
 jabalpur main yadi patiyon ke patni se pratadit hokar bhaagane or sanyasi banane kaa silsilaa isi tarah jari rahaa, to aane vaale samay main narmada ke tat or mandiron main patniyon se dur bhagkar sanyasi banane waalon kii bharmaar ho jaaegi

 ) Does Money Grow on Trees? Not sure lekin agar koi aapse ye kahe ki wo kaagaj ke tukdon ko dollar main badal saktaa he to aapkaa jawaab kya hoga? blike dollar ke dhandhebaajon ke paas wo jaadui takareeb maujuud he, jo dekhte hi dekhte ankhon ke saamne kaagaj ke tukdon ko chamchamaate america dollar main tabdeel kar detii he
 But whoever believes in this trick, his fate does not open, but he becomes a pauper
 aapane jaaduugaron ko naammumkin chizon kommumkin karteto kai baar dekha hoga lekin kya kabhi aisa bhi koi jaadu dekha he, jisaki badaulat kore kaagaj ke tukade bhi hare-hare noton main tabdeel ho jaaen
 The person who converted the pieces of paper into dollars is sitting with complete preparation
 uske paas ek plate main pani jaisaa koi liquid rakhaa he, jabaki do botalon main do or alag-alag rang ke chemical hai
 Along with this, there is also that magical powder of white color in a box, which when applied on pieces of paper, the pieces start turning into notes
 iske baad jaise hi ishaara hota he, dastaanon main lipte do haath wo karishma shuru kar dete hai, jise dekhnaa bhi apane-aap main ek alag kism kaa tajurba he
 After all, how does this black magic work? After a careful look it is revealed that this magician first removes a black piece of paper from the polythene pouch
 iske baad is tukade par safed rang kaa jaadooi powder chhidakta he or phir use kaagaj par acchhee tarah lagane ke baad use plate main rakhe chemical main chhod detaa he
 This piece is still all black
 ab wo paaooch se doosraa tukdaa nikaalata he or use bhi usee tareeke se powder main lapetane ke baad chemical vaale plate main chhod detaa he
 After this, he repeats the same way with the third black piece, but these pieces of paper immersed in chemical are still intact
 yani in tukdon ko is vakt bhi dekh kar ye yakeen karnaa mushkil he ki agle chand minuton main ye tukade note main tabdeel honevaale hai
 But what happens is just like you and we are seeing all this
 jaadugar do bade botalon main se ek main rakhe chemical ko syringe ke sahare baahar nikaalata he or phir use usee plate main daal detaa he, jis par kaale kaagaj ke tukade rakhe hai or phir aati he wo ghadi, jab ye tukade vaaki dollar ban jate hai
 He rubs these pieces finely with a tissue paper and on seeing the pieces of paper starts turning into a currency in front of his eyes
 50-50 euro kii do, jabaki 100 dollar kii ek karansi
 And that too real
 ab jaraa sochie ki agar kamare main baithe-bithaae koi shaks itani aasaani se kaagaj ke tukdon ko note main badal saktaa he, to uske liye khud amir bananaa yaa kisi ko amir bananaa kitna aasaan he?blike dollar kii ajeeb kahanelog ye magic trick dekh kar yakeen kar lete hai ki vaaki is tareeke se note bhi chaape ja sakate hai or amir bhi bana ja saktaa he or phir yaheen wo galati ho jaati he, jiske baad insaan sanbhalane laayak bhi nahin rahata, kyonki kaale dollar ke is kaale jaadu kii tilsmi kahani par yakeen kar wo puri tarah lut chukaa hota he, barbaad ho chukaa hota he
 But what is this, this strange story of the Black Dollar? What was said about a person being given about 21 crores rupees in an e-mail from abroad, he immediately believed it
 lekin iske baad jo kuch hua, us par yakeen karnaa uske liye mushkil ho rahaa he
 Venkat, a poor farmer from Andhra Pradesh, lost Rs 6 lakh due to fraud
 lekin iske baad bhi jab karodon rupye milane kaa uskaa khwab puraa nahin hua, to usne dilli aakar sidhe police se shikaayat kii or nateeja ye hua ki jis shaks ne usekarodon rupedene kaa jhansa de kar usase 6 lakh rupye jhatak liye the, wo aakhirkaar police ke hathe chadh gaya
 If Venkataraman had been a little too late to react, these foreign nationals would have been nine to eleven soon after plundering millions of rupees
 yahaan se shuru hui thi is thagi kii shuruyatvenkat ek roj apane i-mels check kar rahaa tha
 During this time, he got an eye on an e-mail, after seeing which he lost his senses
 use ye mail america kii rahane vaali kisi mahila ne likhaa tha
 The woman said that her husband has died and that she herself is going through the last stage of cancer but before she dies, she has accumulated a total of 8
 5 million dollar kii rakam se hindustan main garib bacchon ke liye skool or aspataal kholana chaahati he
 If she takes up this task in India, she will hand over 40% of her accumulated capital to him
 ye mail padhate hi venkat khwaabon kii duniya main kho gaya kyonki 8
 5 million dollars means about 52 crore 70 lakh rupees and its 40 percent means 21 crores 8 lakh rupees
 venkat ko laga ki uski to duniya hi badal jaaegi
 But whatever happened after that, he moved the ground under Venkat's feet, ruining him
 mahila kii baton main aakar transfar kar die rupeus mahila ne use dollar transfar karne ke liye processing fees or legal fees ke taur par rupayon kii maang kii, to use kuch bhi atapata nahin laga
 
 
 And thus she transferred about 6 lakh rupees in the name of different fees to the woman's account in Delhi, but even after that the woman continued to ask for money, she got some doubt and went straight to Delhi
 lekin yahaan ek hotel main use africa mul kaa ek aisa shaks mila, jisane khud ko us mahila kaa agent bataaya
 He had reached Venkat with a vault of black dollars to keep him in the loop
 lekin isse pehle ki tijori kaa puraa tilism khulata, kaale kaagaj dollar main badalte, venkat kaa shaq gaharaa gaya or wo sidhe police ke paas ja pahunchaa
 Now the police raided the hotel and arrested that foreigner for about 5 crores of fake or black dollars and with this the whole story of the fraud was revealed
 ye wo videshi hi tha, jo jhuthe i-mail bhej kar dilli main baithe-baithe venkat ko lut rahaa tha or ab faraar hone ke firaaq main tha
 a 24-year-old youth committed suicide on Facebook LIVE in Agra, Uttar Pradesh

 It is being told that Munna Kumar committed suicide due to failure to join the Indian Army
 usnefesabukalive main is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki vah bhartiya sena main bhartee hone main baar-baar vifal hone kii vajah se is ghaatak kadam ko uthaa rahaa he

 court ne iske liye donon hi aropiyon ko jamaanat kii aivaj main 2-2 lakh rupee kaa nijee muchalaka bharne kaa aadesh diya he
 Earlier, the Patiala House Court had extended judicial custody of both Tyagi and Khaitan till 13 January

 The CBI had opposed Tyagi's bail, the CBI had also strongly opposed the bail of former Air Force Chief SP Tyagi in this case
 sibiai kaa kahana tha ki ye ek badi or ahm jaanch he, jisamen kai hai rank logon kii bhoomika kii jaanch jari he
 Therefore, if Tyagi is granted bail, it will directly affect the investigation
 abhi kii jaanch main tyaagi ke khilaaf ahm saboot mili hai, jinase ghotaale kii kadiyaan jodne main madad milegi
 The CBI said that evidence has been found to meet the accused and prove their place in the case
 is jaanch ke bare main abhi zyada khulaasa nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki agar aaropee ko pataa chal gaya ki jaanch kis disha main chal rahi he or kisase poochtacha hogi, kahaan red hogi to wo duusare logon ko aagaah kar saktaa he or wo log ahm sabooton ko nasht kar sakate hai
 The translation of the documents is being done by the CBI, saying that the investigating agency is not investigating the money trail, but it is investigating how the crime was carried out

 He said that when he had his first contact with a newspaper in his childhood, it was a 'pradeep' newspaper and during college education he met other newspapers

 in The Supreme Court has also issued notice to the Central Government seeking a reply on the plea to declare Vande Mataram as a national song and make it mandatory in schools
 supreme court ne cinemagharon main rashtriya gaan ke vakt sammaan main khadey hone ke aadesh main sanshodhan karte hue otism, cerebral disability, parkinson beemaari, kusht rogi, maance peshiyon ke rog se peedit logon ko bhi chhot di he
 The Supreme Court will decide on 23 August whether to withdraw the national anthem order in theaters or not
 vahiin, kerala filmkaaron kii ore se ye kaha gaya ki court ko ye aadesh waapas lenaa chahie kyonki logon ko iske liye vivash nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The court should not decide this
 centre ne kaha ki ye durbhagyapurna he ki ek tabaka cinemagharon main rashtriya gaan ke sammaan ke khilaaf he or wo moulik kartavyon ko nibhaana nahin chaahate
 At the same time, it was said on behalf of the petitioner that a law should be made about the national anthem, as of now, there is only a law about the national flag
 vahiin, rajasthan or maharashtra sarkaar bhi supreme court pahunchi hai
 The Maharashtra government has supported the national anthem in theaters
 maharashtra sarkaar ne arji daakhil kar kaha he ki cese main is yachika kaa samarthan karti he
 It has been said in the application that it is unfortunate that a citizen has to come to the constitutional court to show respect for the national anthem
 supreme court ne centre ke saath donon rajyon ko bhi party banaaya he
 On November 30 last year, the Supreme Court in an important order related to the national anthem said that the national anthem would be played before the film starts in all theaters across the country
 saath hi court ne ye bhi kaha ki rashtriya gaan bajte samay cinemahol kii screen par rashtriya dhvaj dikhaaya janaa bhi anivaary hoga or cinemaghar main maujuud sabhi logon ko rashtriya gaan ke sammaan main khadaa hona hoga
 The Supreme Court held that the national anthem is associated with national identity, national unity and constitutional patriotism
 court ke aadesh ke mutabik dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik hit main or kisi bhi tarah kii gatividhi main drama creat karne ke liye rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa or rashtriya gaan ko vairieti song ke taur par bhi nahin gaaya jayega
 The comments darasal shyaam narayan chaukase naam ke ek shaks ne raashtragan bajaane kii janhit yachika daayar kii thi
 In which it was demanded that the national anthem should be played before the film starts in theaters all over the country and proper rules and protocols should be set in relation to playing it and singing it in government ceremonies and programs
 jis par supreme court ne apana faisla sunaaya
 In the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had at present refused to withdraw its interim order
 lekin do muddon par supreme court ne saaf kiya ki kisicinema, newsril yaa dacumentary main rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal kiya gaya he to logon ko khadey hone kii jarurat nahin he
 The Supreme Court also made it clear that people will have to stand in theaters during the national anthem, but it is not necessary that they sing the national anthem
 supreme court 23 agast ko ye tay karegaa ki kya cinemagharon main rashtriya gaan ke aadesh ko waapas le yaa nahin
 At the same time, it was said on behalf of Kerala filmmakers that the court should withdraw this order because people cannot be forced to do it
 court ko ye tay nahin karnaa chahie
 The Center said that it is unfortunate that a section is against the honor of national anthem in theaters and does not want to perform its fundamental duties
 vahiin, yachikakarta kii ore se kaha gaya ki rashtriya gaan ko lekar kanoon banaaya janaa chahie kyonki abhi tak sirf rashtriya dhvaj ko lekar hi kanoon he
 At the same time, the Rajasthan and Maharashtra governments have also reached the Supreme Court
 maharashtra sarkaar ne cinemagharon main rashtriya gaan kaa samarthan kiya he
 The Maharashtra government has filed an application saying that it supports this petition in the case
 arji main kaha he ki ye durbhagyapurna he ki raashtragan ke prati sammaan dikhaane ke liye kisi naagarik ko sanvaidhanik court aana padaa he
 The Supreme Court has made both states a party along with the Center
 pichley saal 30 november ko supreme court ne rashtriya gaan se jude ek ahm aadesh me kaha tha ki deshbhar ke sabhi cinemagharon main film shuru hone se pehle rashtriya gaan zarur bajegaa
 At the same time, the court also said that while playing the national anthem, it would be compulsory to show the national flag on the screen of Cinemahal and all the people present in the cinema hall would have to stand in honor of the national anthem
 supreme court ne kaha ki rashtriya gaan rashtriya pahchaan, rashtriya ekta or sanvaidhanik deshbhakti se judaa he
 According to the court order, it should be kept in mind that the national anthem cannot be used to create a drama in any commercial interest and in any kind of activity and the national anthem will not be sung as Variety Song either
 tippaniyan In fact, a person named Shyam Narayan Chowkse had filed a PIL to play the national anthem
 jisamen yah maang kii gai thi ki deshbhar main cinemagharon main film shuru hone se pehle raashtragan bajaayaa janaa chahie or ise bajaane or sarkaar samarohon or kaaryakramon main ise gane sambandh main uchit niyam or protocol tay hone chahie
 On which the Supreme Court gave its verdict

 bharat ke sarvaadhik karishmai netaaon main shumaar atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa desh ke raajnneetik patal par ek aise vishaal vyaktitv vaale rajaneta ke rup main sammaan kiya jaataa he, jinaki vyapak str par sweekaaryata he or jinhone tamaam avarodhon ko todate hue 90 ke dashak main raajnneeti ke mukhya manch par bhaajapa ko sthapit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 It would be said to be the highlight of Vajpayee's personality that new allies joined the BJP, which was considered politically 'untouchable' at the time, especially after the Babri Masjid demolition due to its right-wing leanings
 apni vaani ke oj or thos faisle lene ke liye vikhyath vaajapeyi ko bharat-pakistan matbhedon ko dur karne kii disha main thos kadam uthaane kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 With these concrete steps, he is known as a politician of a wide spectrum going beyond the 'nationalist political agenda' of the BJP
 congress ke baahar desh ke sarvaadhik lambey samay tak pradhanmantri pad par asin rahane vaale vaajapeyi ko aksar bhaajapa kaa udaaravaadi cheharaa kaha jaataa he
 His critics, however, continue to describe him as a 'mask' of the RSS, whose gentle smile hides his party's relations with Hinduist groups
 1999 kii vaajapeyi kii pakistan yatra kii unki hi party ke ‚Äòkattarwadi netaaon‚Äô ne aalochana kii thi, lekin vah bas par savaar hokar kisi vijeta kii tarah lahore pahunche
 This diplomatic success of Vajpayee was hailed as the beginning of a new era in indo-pak relations, but this is the second point that the Pakistani army intruded into the Kargil of its troops through a stealthy campaign and then broke out between the two sides Pakistan had to face the struggle
 6 disambar 1992 ko ayodhya main car sevakon dwaara babari masjid ko giraae jane kii ghatana vaajapeyi ke liye is baat kii agni pariksha thi ki dharmanirpekshata ke paimaane par vah kahaan khadey hai
 Vajpayee was then the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 vaajapeyi ke vishwaasapaatr sahyogi laalkrishna adwani or adhiktar bhaajapa netaaon ne vidhwans kaa samarthan kiya, lekin vaajapeyi ne spasht shabdon main isaki ninda kii
 His personal loyalty was never questioned, but the arms bribery scandal exposed corruption in his government, and there was a time when his decisions were made clear
 vaajapeyi ek jane maane kavi bhi hai or unke party sahyogi aksar unki rachanaaon ko uddhrut karte hai
 He was born on 25 December 1924 in the city of Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh
 unke pita krishna bihari vaajapeyi or maa krishna devi hai
 Vajpayee's parliamentary experience spanned more than five decades
 vah pehali baar 1957 main sansad sadsy chune gaye the
 As a teenager, Vajpayee was briefly jailed for opposing British colonial rule, but did not play a major role in the freedom struggle
 hindu rashtravaadi sanghathan rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) or jan sangh kaa saath pakadaney se pehle vaajapeyi kuch samay tak samyawad ke sampark main bhi aae
 Later his close ties with the Jana Sangh and then the BJP began after his association with right-wing organizations
 1950 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main aresas kii patrika ko chalaane ke liye vaajapeyi ne kanoon kii padhai bich main chhod di
 He later established his political roots in the RSS and emerged as the moderate voice of the BJP
 raajnneeti main vaajapeyi kii shuruyaat 1942-45 ke bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan swatantraaa senaanee ke rup main hui thi
 He started out as a communist, but gave up communism for membership of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which raised the flag of Hindutva
 sangh ko bhartiya raajnneeti main dakshinpanthi mana jaataa he
 At the same time, Vajpayee became a close follower and associate of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, the founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh
 jab mukherjee ne 1953 main kashmir rajya main pravesh ke liye permit lene kii vyavastha ke khilaaf aamaran anshan kiya to vaajapeyi unke saath the
 Mukherjee termed the permit arrangement as 'trivial' treatment of Indian nationals traveling to Kashmir
 saath hi unhone muslim bahul aabaadi hone ke kaaran kashmir ko vishesh darja die jane ke khilaaf bhi aamaran anshan kiya tha
 Mukherjee's fast and protest culminated in ending the permit system and intensifying the merger of Kashmir with the Indian Union, but Mukherjee died after weeks of imprisonment, illness and weakness
 in sari ghatnaon ne yuva vaajapeyi ke man par gahari chhap chodi
 Carrying on Mukherjee's legacy, Vajpayee contested and won his first election in 1957
 bhartiya jansangh ke netaa ke rup main unhone iske raajnneetik daayre, sanghathan or agenda kaa vistaar kiya
 In spite of his youth, Vajpayee soon became a respected figure in the opposition, whose arguments and rationality also started convincing his opponents
 unki vyapak apil ne ubharate rashtravaadi saanskrithik andolan ko sammaan, pahchaan or sweekaaryata dilaayi

 ye sabhi ek channel main kaam karte hai, jahaan ranvijay sho kaa host he
 
 
 Sunny's Mehbooba goes to a closed mill to shoot the show at night, and she dies under mysterious circumstances
 
 
 iske baad sani iraadaa banaata he, ek bhutaha sho banane kaa, or vah chahta he ki vah apane camere main bhuton or preton kaa rahasy or unki gatividhiyon ko kaid kare
 
 
 For shooting the show he takes his friends to the same Rudra mill where his girlfriend died, and then you have to watch the film to know what happens in the ruins
 
 
 vaise, puri film flashbek main he, jisame sani kahani suna rahaa he college ke chaatro ko
 
 
 The film tries to explain that there are ghosts and wandering spirits
 
 
 unki apni ek duniya he, or chunki teen baje (3 eem) ke vakt raat sabase zyaada andheri hoti he, so, isi vakt atmaaen zyaada sakriy ho jaati hai
 
 
 The first half of the film is very fast
 
 
 drishy daraavne hai, becoground music acha he
 
 
 While watching the film, it is waiting for three o'clock, because the real event was happening at the same time
 
 
 '3 eem' main thrill bhi he, lekin film kaa doosraa bhaag behad kamazor he
 
 
 Amidst the ruins, a song suddenly arrives during the nightly horror show, that too in college
 
 
 aisa lagata he, is gane ke liye jabardastee jagah banaai gai he, jo kahani ke bichombich aane kii vajah se samaj main hi nahin aati
 
 
 Even at the beginning of the film, many kiss scenes and the bed scenes between the heroine and the heroine are given without any reason, because i think the work can be done without such scenes to show love
 
 
 main kah saktaa hum ki shaayad yuvaaon ko aakarshith karne ke liye film ko daraavna banane ke saath-saath romantic rakhane kii koshish bhi kii gai hogi, lekin chunki main film ke duusare half se kaaphi niraash hua, isliye is film ke liye meri reating he - 2

 He said that the company has begun to 'deviate' from the core principles and values of governance on which it stands today
 gangwal ne apane is shikaayat kii copy pradhanmantri narendra modi, vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman, nagar vimaanan mantri hardip singh puri or vaanijya mantri piyush goyal ko bhi bheji he

 gangwal kii vajah se hi indigo ne record sankhya main vimaanon ke order die hai or bharat main aakraamak tareeke se apana kaam badha rahi he
 Gangwal, who has become a US citizen, works behind the scenes, while Rahul Bhatia oversees the growth and regular functioning of airlines in India
 yah matbhed pichley do saal main kai maukon par dekha gaya

 Three reputed colleges have come on the watch list of Maharashtra's anti-naxal Operation (ANO) after arrests of people sympathetic to Maoism this year

 Maharashtra's anti-terrorism Squad (ATS) and ANO believe that these colleges can be the new recruitment ground for these Maoists who are carrying out their operations through the thick forests of Chhattisgarh
 deshbhar main maovadiyon ke 48 agua sanghathanon or shaikshanik sansthaaon ko nigaraanee suchi main rakhaa gaya he
 "we are seeing the urban spread of Maoists in the same way as we see cases of Islamic fundamentalism," says an ATS source
 ‚Äô‚Äôcollege campus bharat kii us sabase puraani ladaai ke liye nae maidan ban gaye hai, jinamein 2005 se ab tak 8,000 logon kii jaan ja chuki he
 Police say the Maoists' access to students is in fact a secret battle of hearts and minds to identify future leaders and establish ideological bridges with urban organizations

 His family members say that he was arrested from Raipur in Chhattisgarh while he was going to meet a lawyer
 chaatr andolankaaree yaa jo maovadi vichaardhaara ke prati sahanubhuti rakhte hai, nigaraanee ke pehle bindu par hai
 Sources in the ATS and Special Operations say that students entering the Master of Social Work program have the highest chance of getting attracted to the "maoist ideology"
 ‚Äô‚Äô police khuleam sakriy un ‚Äò‚Äòoverground workars‚Äô‚Äô ke khilaaf karrwai kar rahi he jo maovadiyon ko shaharon main kaary sanchalit karne or bhartee karne main madad karte hai

 grih mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòunki shahari yojana kii dhajjiyaan ud chuki hai
 The Maoists have not yet been able to find a leader to replace Kobad Gandhi
 ‚Äô‚Äôdoon skool main padhe sampann parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaale gandhi ko 2009 main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha or tab se vah tihaad jail main band hai
 But IB officials do not agree with the Home Ministry's opinion
 ibi ke ek varisht adhikari kaa kahana he, ‚Äò‚Äòmaovadiyon ke paas shikshit, adarshavaadi yuvaaon or bhavishya ke ranneetikaron kii baari kami he
 So they are actively searching for them in the cities
 ‚Äô‚Äôhaal main aties or rajya police ke eeno dwaara jo maovadi sahitya jabt hua he, usamen ‚Äòencirkilment‚Äô yani gheraabandi shabd kaa baar-baar istemaal hua he
 Its purpose is to increase the impact in colleges and to connect the employees of Technology Hentra
 maovadiyon kii bhartee karne waalon ke kaam karne kaa tarika yah he ki ve pehle shahar ke kisi college main daakhila lete hai or chaatro ko apane mat se jodate hai
 Police say this strategy is to replicate the so-called 'JNU model' in educational institutions across the country, which incidentally has won the victory of leftist organization AISA in the student union elections held in mid-september

 nagpur ke 35 varshiya surendra gadling kehete hai ki rajya sarkaar kaa agenda saaf he
 He is a lawyer for many agitators called Maoists in Vidarbha region
 unka aarope he ki rajya ko maovadiyon se ladgaye ke liye paisa miltaa he or maovadi ilaakon main posting lene par afasaron kii tankhwaah main 50 fisadi vruddhi kar di jaati he

 puure din kii maathapai ke baad aakhirkaar madhya pradesh ke siem ke naam kaa bhopal main guuruuvaar ko der raat ko elaan ho gaya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted a photo around 8 pm
 jisamen wo kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke saath dikh rahe the
 In this, he gave a political message by writing a statement by Leo Tolstoy that patience and time are the two most powerful warriors
 aisa mana gaya ki iske madhyam se rahul gandhi ne jyotiraditya ko dhairya rakhane ke liye kah diya or yah bataa diya ki kamalnath kaa samay aa gaya he
 After this, Jyotiraditya Scindia wrote on twitter around eight thirty in the night that "this is not a race and this is not for the chair, we are here to serve the people of Madhya Pradesh, i am coming to Bhopal, and today only the CM Name will be announced
 " isse bhi aisa laga ki jyotiraditya ne kamalnath ke saamne sarender kar diya he
 Throughout the day, the name of both of them was getting heated
 kyonki dilli main manthan chal rahaa tha duusari ore bhopal main samarthak bekaabu ho rahe the
 Slogans were being raised in favor of Kamal Nath and Scindia
 faisle se pehle hi samarthakon ne kamalnath ko siem bana diya or kamalnath nae siem vaala poster laga diya
 Scindia supporters also came prepared
 kamalnath kaa poster dekha to wo sindhiya kaa katout le aae or maala pahanaakar siem bana diya
 In Delhi, the Gandhi family was busy churning on Kamal Nath and Scindia
 vaise to 4 baje tak naam tay hona tha
 But this could not happen
 kamalnath or sindhiya ke samarthak narebaazi karte hue bhopal main congress mukhyalay ke baahar jute gaye
 The situation was that Shobha Ojha and Abhay Dubey had to come out to handle the case, but no one was ready to accept
 congress ke netaa bhale hi is takaraav ko atiutsaah or jeet kaa josh bataa rahe hai, lekin yah saaf dekha ja rahaa tha donon ke samarthak bhidane ko taiyaar the
 It seemed that nobody wanted to miss a chance
 agar rahul ke saath rajasthan ke netaaon ke meeting kii baat karen to, subah rajasthan ke paryvekshakon se rahul gandhi kii meeting hui
 At around 12 noon, Sachin reached the house of the pilot Rahul Gandhi
 payalat se meeting khatm hui to kuch der baad ashok gahalot bhi pahunche
 Meanwhile, outside the Congress headquarters in Delhi, there were slogans of pilot supporters
 donon netaaon ko guuruuvaar ko hi jaipur lautnaa tha, lekin khabaren ain ki unhen roka gaya
 Rahul Gandhi had a meeting with Supervisor of Madhya Pradesh AK Antony at 2:30 in the afternoon
 kareeb 4 baje jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi rahul gandhi ke ghar pahunche
 Meanwhile, supporters of Kamal Nath and Scindia gathered at the Congress headquarters in Bhopal
 isi bich sonia gandhi bhi rahul se milane ke liye unke ghar pahunchin
 Priyanka Vadra also reached Rahul Gandhi's house at around 5 pm
 kareeb 7 baje kamalnath rahul gandhi se milane unke ghar pahunche
 Ashok Gehlot said at 7 in the evening that it takes time when the leader of the legislative party is elected, everyone talks and invokes everyone
 There is nothing new
 yogi ko chunane main bijepi ko 7 din kaa vakt laga thatripura main bijepi ko mukhyamantri chunane main teen din kaa vakt laga tha
 In Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, BJP had taken six days to choose CM
 uttar pradesh main to bijepi ko mukhyamantri pad ke liye yogi adityanath kaa naam final karne main 7 din lag gaye the
 The BJP high command also took a long time of nine days to stamp in the name of Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra
 haalanki goa main jodtod se sarkaar banane vaali bijepi ne ek hi din main siem pad ke liye manohar parrikar ke naam par mohar laga di thi or haryana main manohar laal khatter kaa naam tay karne main bijepi ko do din lage the
 However, in Assam and Gujarat, it did not take time to choose the Chief Minister, because the name of the CM was already decided there
 yani agar mukhyamantri kaa naam pehle se tay naa ho to chunaav jeetne ke baad mukhyamantri chunane main sabko vakt lagata he phir chaahe wo congress ho yaa bijepi or madhyapradesh or rajasthan main congress ko jite do hi din to hue he
 However, during these two days, factionalism of Congress divided in camps has come to the fore
 srilankai cricket team ke anbhavi ballebaaj mahela jayavardhane ne hamawatan visphotak salaami ballebaaj sanath jayasoorya kaa vishwa cap main sabase tej shatak banane kaa record tod diya he

 By the time these columns are published, it is possible that a forgettable chapter in the history of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been sealed
 mujhe is baat par bada hi afsos ho rahaa he ki maujuuda sibiai pramukh ranjit sinha bade beabaru hokar vidaa ho rahe hai
 However, the then UPA government had justified his selection on the basis that he was the senior-most among the officers available for the post in the country
 beuro main bhi kai log unke vidaa hone se raahat kii saans lenge
 As far as i have heard, according to him, Sinha believed in pulling the slot alone while defying all the understanding of his junior officers while giving final orders in any case
 misaal ke taur par yah yakeen karnaa mushkil he ki koyala ghotaale kii jaanch karne vaala koi bhi afasar purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh se poochtacha na karke santusht rah saktaa tha
 How was it possible, while Manmohan Singh was also looking after the work of the Ministry of Coal at that time
 ek vishesh adaalat kii haal hi main kii gai tippanee ke sandarbh main yah jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ko sibiai kii jirah se bachaae rakhane kaa faisla sibiai pramukh ne apni ore se kiya tha yaa phir iske peeche ek tarah kii sarvanumati thi
 Officers at four or five levels give their opinion about it in writing before a final decision is taken in any case in this investigating agency
 nideshak str ke kisi adhikari ke liye bhi apane saare adhinsthon kii raay ko darkinar karke ek pratyakshtaya ulataa faisla lenaa badi himmat kaa kaam he
 Even if i believe that all his controversial decisions have been taken honestly, it is very difficult for me to take his side
 aisa nahin ho saktaa ki aap bich dhara main naav ko buree tarah hilaa daalen or phir bhi surakshit tanakar khadey rahen
 It was Sinha's clumsy style that led to his downfall
 mere liye yah samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he ki kyon unhone un tamaam avaanchhneeya logon se baar-baar milanaa pasand kiya jo jaanch se jude hue or andeh ke ghere main the
 The lesson to be learned from this is that either you do not keep the details of your visitors or you can only meet such respected people, whose honesty can not be doubted
 jaahir he ki sibiai nideshak sinha ke maamle main aisa nahin hua
 The Ranjit Sinha episode is also a big setback for his earlier CBI directors
 yah un logon ke liye bhi jhatka he jo lagaataar sibiai kii swaittata kii maang uthaate aae hai
 No government has taken any responsibility for the use of CBI
 yah baat bhi kisi se chuphi hui nahin he
 It seems that any government has great pleasure in telling the CBI what it should do or not
 aise main lakh take kaa sawaal yahi he ki us agency se kaise uskaa behtareen kaam karaayaa jaae jisamen nyaaypalika or aam aadmi, donon kaa atoot bharosa he
 The fact is that despite much mud being spilled, the CBI has solved a lot of cases with the state police
 mul rup se jisaki pariklpana sarkaar ke bhrashtachar-nirodhi ang ke rup main kii gai thi, vah kalantar main badi sankhya main ansulajhe aparaadhon ke chalate paidaa hue avishvaas ko paatane ke kram main aparaadh sulajhane vaali ek shakha ban gai
 There is a line of such loyal officers in the CBI, who do not have any big prospects to see as future careers
 pad par rahete hue ve epabiai samet duniya ke kisi bhi desh kii jaanch agency jitani hi dakshata dikhaate hai
 His excellent work is seen only under a capable leadership
 lihaaja agency ke liye yah jaruri he ki ipies adhikariyon main se koi sarvshereshth unhen unke kaam ke maamle main rasta dikhaae
 While choosing Sinha's successor, the new government will have to move very cautiously and choose an officer who is not only qualified and honest but can also set a good example in front of his subordinates
 aise kai log seva main hai or unamem se koi ek chunanaa mushkil kaam nahin
 But the issue is that having such an efficient selection will not bring back the agency's reputation
 ham supreme court kii vah adbhut tippanee nahin bhul sakate ki 'sibiai mahaj sarkaar kaa pinjre main band tota he‚Äô
 Those who are against giving the CBI more freedom to work, are afraid that the CBI will become an uncontrollable missile that will target big names within and outside the government
 yah shuddh rup se ek bhulaava he
 Being CBI autonomous does not mean being irresponsible and irresponsible
 sibiai kanoon ke daayre ke baahar ek swechhachari sanghathan to nahin ho saktaa naa
 There are many ways in the system that an uncontrollable investigation agency can be controlled
 yah ek aisa najuk santulan he jo koi hoshiyaar or eemaandaar sarkaar hi kaayam kar sakati he
 i am sure that the NDA government has the ability to achieve this balance

 Ok, so she didn't like someone touching her
 And everyone's automatically assumed that her 'overnight' fame got to her head
 Ever stopped to reason otherwise? 1
 What if she's just having a bad day? How nice are any of us, on our bad days? 2
 So what if her fame was 'overnight'? Maybe that's what she was destined for! You clearly didn't pay a dime for it
 3
 Celebs throw tantrums all the time! Don't you still pay to go watch them play a role, for which they're paid 10 times your annual income? 4
 So what if she slept on footpaths? How does that make her any less of a human? To have bad days or just be plain moody? ‚ñ´Ô∏èto the men insulting women because of your male ego
 ‚ñ´Ô∏èto the women insulting other women, just because they make you feel insecure
 ‚ñ´Ô∏èto those of you fighting the roadside vendors for a discount, but quietly paying twice the price at a store
 thoseto those of you who step out of religious places, only to gossip about someone who you saw there
 ‚ñ´Ô∏èto those of you who'd rather feed a statue, than a hungry mouth
 thoseto those of you who cannot digest the fact that someone else is living a better life than you are
 Who gave you the right to judge her, without looking at yourselves first? 
 Media and words - when misused, can be more lethal than a weapon
 Stop assuming stuff about someone you don't even know on a personal level
 Everyone is dealing with their own shit
 Celeb or not

 66 years have passed since Pakistan was formed, but this country is going to have a democratic transfer of power for the first time
 chuni hui sarkaar ne apana kaarykaal puraa kar liya he, swatantra chunaav ayog kaa gathan hua he or saaf-suthere tathaa nishpaksh chunaav karwaane ke liye kaman tatasth keretekar nizaam ko saunp di gai he
 But the fear of violence is clearly visible
 saamaanya halaat main bhi chunaav ke dauraan maahaul puri tarah se garmaaya rahata he-netaa puure josh ke saath prachaar karte hai, chunavi sabhaayen hoti hai, chappe-chappe par reliyon kaa aayojan hota he or meley jaisaa alam rahata he
 In Pakistan, it seems that election campaigning is done solely for television screens, not for street-mongers
 punjab ke baahar chunavi sargharmiyaan kuch khaas nahin hai, yahaan chunaav prachaar itnaa uttejnaa bharaa hota he ki pratyaashee kabhi-kabhaar yahi bhul jate hai ki vah kis party ke saath he
 For example, Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan, who has been holding large rallies so far due to the concession from the Taliban, inadvertently asked voters to vote for PML-N at a rally, "now Go and stamp the lion (pml-n's election symbol)
 ‚Äô‚Äô apni is galati ke baad ve hanse or khud ko kuch aise durust kiya, ‚Äò‚Äòballe pe, sher kaa to main shikari hum
 "his main rival Mian Nawaz Sharif, who is dreaming of becoming Prime Minister for the third time, did not miss out on the mistake that came out of Imran's mouth," even our enemy wants you to stamp the lion
 ‚Äô‚Äô logon main piemail-en kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar khaas utsaah nahin he
 About 1
 3 karod aise yuva voter hai jo pehali baar vot denge
 These youngsters can vote for Imran Khan
 shekhoopura kii raily main navaj ne shrotaaon se kaha ki ve haath uthaakar dikhaaen ki unamem kitne noujvaan hai
 When the crowd responded enthusiastically to him, he said in Punjabi, "low Dasso, all youth are Sheikhupura ho ho ai Nawaz Sharif de jalse te
" o jede baaki youth di gallaan karade ne, o kithe ne? o kedy youth di gallaan karaden nen? (saare noujvaan to shekhpura main navaj sharif kii sabha main ikattha hai

 ve kin naujavaanon kii baat karte hai)
 "pakistan has 30 percent of the voters who vote for the first time
" unke paas ek dikkat teesraa vikalp bhi he pakistan pipuls party (pipipi)
 It is easy to predict if there is a possibility of a coalition in two-party mainstream politics, but in a battle of three parties in which everyone prefers to sit in opposition rather than forging alliances, the work of political analysts would be a little difficult
 is
 ek dikkat or he: kuch aatanki samoohon ke gathjod taharik-e-taliban pakistan (titipi) ke maamle main dekhen to-jiske nishane par pichhali sarkaar ke vam jhukaav vaale saare madhyamargi gathbandhan sahyogi hai jaise pipipi, avami neshnal party (eenpi) or muttahida kaumi movement (emcuam)-aisa lagata he ki ye chunaav sirf punjab main hone ja rahe hai jo anya kii tulana main aatankwaad se kam grast he or jahaan asli pratidwandvi piemail-en or pitii hai
 Both these parties are soft on terrorism
 khan par talibani samarthak hone ke aarope lagate rahe hai jabaki sharif bandhuon ne sampradayik aatanki sanghathanon kaa chunavi gathbandhan banaaya
 The fear of terror is everywhere
 jaisaa pichley saal pakistan or america kii dohari naagarikta ke chalate supreme court ke haathon barkhaast hui pipipi kii purv saansad farhanaaj isfhani kahati hai, ‚Äò‚Äòjab tak in teen vam jhukaav vaale dalon ko nishaanaa banane vaali aatanki karravaayiyon par roak nahin lagegi, tab tak chunaav swatantra or nishpaksh nahin ho sakate
 It is necessary for the development of Pakistan as a landmark that one elected government should historically hand over power in the hands of another elected government without any hassle
 ‚Äô‚Äôapril ke ant main karachi main hui do sanyukt press conferencon main pipipi, eenpi or emcuam ke netaaon ne khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa or sindh main talibani hamale main maare gaye apane kaaryakartaaon ke baavjood chunaav ladgaye kaa sankalp jataayaa
 Those who believe in the stories of the conspiracy say that the liberal parties are being deliberately kept out of power in the wake of the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan
 raksha or rajnatik maamalon ke vishleshak hasan ascari rizvi kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòyah (titipi se khatra) islamic or dakshinpanthi dalon ke liye bilkul saaf sanket he ki ve yaa to taliban ko samarthan jari rakhen yaa phir unhen kootnithik laabh den
 "they say," the Taliban and those who directly condemn terror are in danger
 ‚Äô‚Äôsuraksha kaarnon se pipipi ke chunaav prachaar abhiyaan main khalal padaa he
 His chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been forced to command the election campaign by sending his recorded message through videotape
 ve kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòmain aapke bich rahakar chunaav prachaar karnaa chahta tha
 i wanted to go to the streets of the country with every worker

 The National Assembly of Pakistan has 342 seats, out of which 272 national seats are held in direct elections and out of which PPP will not get more than 60 seats
 inamen bhi adhiktar sindh se hongi
 Of the remaining 70 seats, 60 seats have been reserved for women and 10 seats for non-muslims
 piemail-en ko 90 siten aane kii ummid he jinamein adhiktar punjab se hongi
 This time it will be a big change compared to the seats won by both parties in the 2008 elections
 inke vot kaatane kaa kaam imran khan or nirdaleey ummidavaar karenge
 If Imran does not come with anyone after the election results, both Zardari and Sharif will have to depend on independents and other regional parties for additional seats because till now Imran's party has rejected any alliance with both
 Have done saare sanket ek kamjor or asthir gathbandhan sarkaar kii ore ja rahe hai jo vipareet sthiti main pakistan ko patari par laane ke liye jaruri kade aarthik or rajnatik faisle lene main aksham sabit hogi
 TV anchor Asma Shiraji says, "many people believe that PPP and PML-N have been tried, so now it's Imran Khan's turn
" jahaan tak meraa maananaa he, punjab main piemail-en or pitii ke bich barabari kaa muqabla hoga, lekin pipipi abhi khel se baahar nahin hui he
 It can still bring 55 to 60 seats
 navaj sharif ne pipipi yaa pitii ke saath gathbandhan banane kii baat ko nakaara nahin he or unhen raashtrapati jaradaari ke jariye shapath lene main dikkat nahin hogi
 In a recent speech, Sharif also spoke of the presidency
 sutron ke mutabik, piemail-en ke bheetar yah baat shuru ho chuki he ki agar party satta main aati he to navaj sharif raashtrapati banenge yaa pradhanmantri
 Broadly speaking, the star of PML-N is said to be strong in surveys and analyzes
 navaj sharif ‚Äô80 ke dashak ke iklaute bache hue lokapriy netaa hai
 The second was Benazir
 punjab main unke paaramparik vot bank or roodhiwaadee samarthakon ko chhod den to sharif ne faujee or siyaasi satta se takaraa kar apni haisiyat banaai he
 He was estranged from the ISI right-wing alliance Islamic Jamhuri Ittehad (IJI) and to this day has kept himself away from the legacy of General Ziaul Haq
 unki raajnneeti mote taur par aarthik tarakkee or sainya satta ke barakes naagarik satta ke aagrah ke lokapriy muhaavaron par tiki he
 Election analysts have differing opinions
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki piemail-en ko punjab se 100 se zyada siten aaengi or vah gathbandhan sarkaar banane kii sthiti ke bahut kareeb hoga
 Others believe that this is not possible because Imran Khan's popularity will dent it
 imran khan ne pakistan ko duniya ke nakshe par cricket ke madhyam se sthapit kiya or isiilie ve aaj hero hai

 "they believe that Khan can get 50 seats and mostly from Punjab," Nawaz Sharif would have no place to recover if the PTI damaged the PML-N in Punjab

 In 2012, Pakistan attracted so much foreign investment that was 12 per cent of its GDP (which was around 22 per cent in 2007) and Sharif has no plans to increase his coffers by taxing the rich
 aadhuniktaa kaa majaa garib nahin le saktaa lekin sharif ke paas garibi hataane kaa koi vijan hi nahin he
 Sharif knows that he cannot liberalize the economy without imposing tax, even though his own supporters are anti-tax and they do not see any solution to this problem

 As far as the relationship between the military and civil power is concerned, Sharif signed the Charter of Democracy (COD) with Benazir Bhutto on the one hand to strengthen the country in the country and on the other hand to take the path of peace with India

 Leader of BJP and Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley, who reached Lucknow for Uttar Pradesh election campaign, called bsp's' Ugahiraj 'and earlier' Samajwadi Party 'gundaraj' as the main issue and said that 2G of all Congress leaders coming in the state The questions raised by the court's decision in the spectrum case should be sought
 arun jetali ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, ‚Äòpradesh main sapa or basapa ke saadhe aath saal ke shasankaal main rahe ‚Äògunda raaj‚Äô or ‚Äòsansthagat ugaahi raaj‚Äô ko chunauti dena, jovidhansabha chunaavka kendriya mudda he or2ji spectrum par supreme court ke faisleke baad is vyavastha ko chunauti dene ke congress ke adhikaar ko chot lagi he
 He said that every Congress leader coming for campaigning in the state should first answer the questions arising out of the Supreme Court's decision on 2G spectrum, which has allocated 122 licenses of Spectrum 'illegally and illegally by fraud'
 The agreement is canceled
 jetali ne2ji spectrum aavanton ghotalemen puri samprag sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa karte hue kaha, ‚Äòyah ek vyakti kaa nahin balki mantriparishad kaa faisla tha, jisamen tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri or vitt mantri khaastaur se jimmedaar he
 He said that this question is merely technical as to which court will conduct the investigation
 sach baat yah he ki ab us faisle main shaamil har vyakti kii raajnneetik evam naitik hi nahin balki kanoonee javabdehi bhi hogi
 Jaitley said that the decision of the Supreme Court has not only raised questions on the morality of the central government, but it is natural to raise doubts in the minds of not only the Indians but also about the entire Indian economy
 isse nivesh kamjor hoga or rajasav evam rojgaar donon main kami aayegi
 Responding to a question, the BJP leader said, "after the court's decision in the allocation of spectrum, the then Finance Minister and current Home Minister p Chidambaram should now think for himself how appropriate it is for him to continue in office
 ‚Äô 2ji spectrum aavanton main hue kathith ghotaale me pradhanmantri kii bhoomika ke bare main sawaal hone par jetali ne kaha ki yah samprag sarkaar kaa samuhik nirnay tha, isliye ve apni jimmedaari se munh nahi mode sakate
 The mention of timely allegations in the 2G spectrum allocation case said that sometimes the media and sometimes the Comptroller and Auditor General and Examiner (CAG) caught the attention of the government in this matter, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh never 'forced the alliance' So to save the then Telecom Minister a Raja, it has worked to cover up this scam

 Regarding the promise made by the Congress in its manifesto about memorialization of great men, they said that there is nothing wrong in building monuments of great men

 unhone kaha ki arvind kejariwal bihar, purvanchal or baaki rajyon ke logon se nafrat karte hai
 You may have political enmity with me, but the hatred you are showing towards the people of Bihar and Purvanchal is not right
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal jaanate hai ki wo apni jameen kho chuke hai
 The people of Delhi will teach them a lesson
 5 lakh kaa beemaa modi sarkaar detii he, lekin kejariwal sarkaar ne rajya main ye yojana lagu nahin kii
 People of Bihar and UP will teach them a lesson
 darasal, ravivaar ko arvind kejariwal ne logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha kibihar kaa ek aadmi 500 rupee ke tiktase train main baithkar dilli main aata he or 5 lakh kaa ilaaj free main karvaa kar chalaa jaataa he
 It gives happiness that there are people of our country, everyone should be treated
 lekin dilli kii apni kshamta he, puure desh ke logon kaa kaise ilaaj karegi, isliye jarurat he ki saare desh main swasthya suvidhaayen sudhare
 What else did Manot Tiwari say
 
 
 bijepi saansad ne kaha ki kejariwal upi bihar ke logon ko dilli main ilaaj dene par bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Kejriwal is a failure and unabashed
 dilli sakasham he
 Kejriwal is going to be discharged in 2020, as he will answer the election in his own language
 arvind kejariwal un bihar ke logon ko ilaaj dene par sawaal uthaa rahe hai jo pehle se hi baadh se behaal hai

 The US President said, his (assad's) call for dialogue and reform is hollow, because he is putting his own people in jail, harassing them and killing their own people
 hamane lagaataar kaha he ki raashtrapati asad ko loktantric parivartan kii aguwai kerani chahie yaa raste se hat janaa chahie
 He did not lead

 or khel shuru ho jaataa he, kai kahaniyaan saamne aati hai or kai nakaab utarate hai
 Vijay Raj comes and breathes new life
 aisi kahaniyaan dekhakar vaaki majaa aata he, jinamein originelity hoti he
 It is a completely Vishal Bhardwaj style film
 star apilakhalujan (nasiruddin shah) or babban miyaan (arshad varsi) pehle kii tarah out of control hai
 But Begum Para (madhuri Dixit) and Muniya (huma Qureshi) who came in this part have added freshness to the story
 maadhuri ne apni vaapasi ke liye ekadam sahi film chuni he or ve role main jami bhi hai
 Huma is also good
 naseer or arshad, khaalu or babban ke role main jamate hai
 Both the earlier films of Naseer's Jackpot and Arshad's Caravalho flop have also been important for them
 lekin unki acting acchhee he
 Surprise packages are Vijay Raj
 dely baili kii hi tarah unhone is film main bhi kamaal kii parformens di he
 In today's era, when movies are Rs 200, 300 and 500 crores
 ke aankadon ko chune kii res main najar aa rahi hai, aise main dedh ishkia acchhee kahani or treetment kaa sukun lekar aati he
 The film cannot be expected to touch a very big figure but Abhishek Chaubey's direction is truly commendable and makes the film a matchless entertainment
 desipan kii mahak he
 But how much this film can connect youth and mass, this will determine its success

 According to the list of terrorists present with Aaj Tak, there are around 136 Lashkar terrorists in the Kashmir Valley
 ye sabhi aatanki lashkar ke mukhya commander abu dujana ke netruv main suraksha balon par hamale kar rahe hai
 According to information received from intelligence sources, Hafiz Saeed's right hand and his most important Saifullah Sajid Jat have been brainwashing Abu Dujana in Pakistan to attack in the Kashmir Valley and snatch the weapons of security forces

 When Ranbir Kapoor knocked in Bollywood, Rishi Kapoor's Sahebzade had a tremendous success
 unki fain list main teji se ijapha hua
 Her towel became the heartbeat of many girls in 'saawariya' (2007)
 phir unhone 'vek ap cid' (2009) or 'ajab prem kii gajab kahani' (2009) se yuva dilon ke taron ko chhedaa
 From 'rajneeti' (2010), 'rockstar' (2011) and 'barfi' (2012), he gave the variety that is necessary for any actor
 phir 'ye javaani he divaani' (2013) ne unhen superstar banane kii raah par dhakel diya
 But it is not a matter of everyone to maintain success
 unke saath bhi aisa hi hua
 Then it is said that breaking one's heart is not a good thing, and the same happened for Ranbir
 unhone katrina caff se dosti ke liye deepika padukon ke saath apane kuch-kuch kii bali de daali
 Perhaps this can also be considered the turning point of his career
 2013 main film ai 'besharm' or uske saath hi unke kariyar ke graph ne dharti choona shuru kar diya
 Then 'roy' (2015), 'bombay Velvet' (2015) and 'tamasha' (2015) all went to the box office and meanwhile, their friend Katrina also left
 unki haalat kuch is tarah hui: 'na khuda hi mila na visaale sanam, na idhar ke rahe na udhar ke rahe
 Then his fast-running career has come on a tortoise move, and he yearns for a near hit
 verieti ko banaae rakhana hogub unakifilm 'i dil he mushkil'relies ho rahi he
 Of course, the songs of the film are gaining momentum among the youth and the quartet of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anushka Sharma, Fawad Khan and Ranbir is arousing interest, but the fear about Ranbir is that he may not be a victim of duplication
 Huh
 kyonki jis tarah kaa geoup or andaaj vah lekar aae hai, us tarah kaa kuch-kuch ham 'rockstar' or 'tamaasha' main bhi dekh chuke hai
 He has been seen as an injured lover
 gayak bhi ban chuke hai
 If you are seen again in the same old style, then there is little chance that the audience can take them down the neck
 vaise bhi unka muqabla diwaali par ajay devgan kii ection pack 'shivaay' se he
 So it is very important to have something new
 romance se zyada kariyar par focus jaruriranbir kapurpichley kuch dinon main apane kaam kii jagah apane prem prasangon kii vajah se surkhiyon main rahe hai
 Sometimes with Deepika Padukone and sometimes with Katrina Kaif
 ab gocip kaa bazaar garm he ki unkiifere shruti hasan ke sathchal rahaa he
 If there is truth in this matter then there is nothing wrong
 sitaron ke afares hote hi hai, or surkhiyaan banati hi hai
 But it is also good if you work with Ishq
 sirf romance ke dam par jindagi nahin chalaa karti
 Some headlines should also be made of rolls and work
 jis bare main vah in dinon bilkul pichde hue hai
 Ranveer Singh is in competition with Ranveer Singh, three years after Ranbir Kapoor started his career
 lekin kirdaaron main verieti kii vajah se vah unase kaaphi aage nikal gaye hai
 By the way, after friendship with Deepika, he has only grown
 gaalib kaa yah sher ranbir kapur par ekadam sateek baithta he 'ishk ne ‚Äògaalib‚Äô nikamma kar diya, varna ham bhi aadmi the kaam ke
 'but Ranveer sat down in this matter
 unhone ishk ko paras pathar bana diya or khud ko nikhaar liya
 His example is his choice of films
 jise 'bajirao mastaani' ke jariye samajha ja saktaa he
 Now his 'padmavati' is also coming
 ranbir ko ranvir se kuch siikhnaa chahie
 If you want to follow the path of your father, if Ranbir Kapoor wants to take a lesson from his father's career too
 jinhone 'khel khel main (1975)' se lekar 'kabhi kabhi (1978)' jaisi filmein kii hai
 Memorable films like 'amar Akbar Anthony' and 'karj' and 'sagar' are also his names
 unhone multistarar bhi kii or amitabh bachchan ke saath unki jodi kaaphi hit bhi rahi
 Ranbir Kapoor should also take advantage of his experience with films because even today Rishi Kapoor is doing films like 'do Doon Chaar'
 is tarah har samay main khud ko praasangik banaae rakhane kii kala ranbir ko apane pita se seekhni chahie
 In an effort to create a global organization against Islamic State militants in Iraq, US President Barack Obama called Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott to discuss the current state of the war-torn country

 Not only this, the modi-shah-doval trio planned to show pro-kashmir attitude after the weakening of Article 370
 bhaajapa or aresas ke netaaon se kaha gaya ki apane jashn main sanyam baraten
 The party took the line of how Article 370 stalled the development of Kashmir, keeping the people backward and enriching only a few political families
 gauratlab he ki rajya main aarthik vikaas dar asthir he or prati vyakti aay rashtriya ausat se neeche he, jabaki jammu-kashmir main garibi dar rashtriya ausat se aadhi or rajya kaa maanav vikaas suchakank rashtriya ausat se upar tha
 During his 2017 visit to Jammu, Shah had said that the incident of the death of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (a former incarnation of the BJP), states that Article 370 is unfair and revocable
 mukherjee ko rajya ko pradaan kiye gaye vishesh darje ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan karte hue may 1953 main jammu-kashmir police ne giraftaar kiya tha or ek maheene baad police hiraasat main unki maut ho gai thi

 According to a government official, this would end the current practice of having the chief minister of the state as the chief minister is also from the valley
 isse hindu bahul jammu kshetra kii ore dhyaan kendrit hoga
 The people of the valley are shocked by this move and the presence of such a large number of security forces
 lekin kya yah tufaan se pehle kii khamoshi he? kashmir main tainaat suraksha balon ko dar he ki ek jwalamukhi fatne kaa intjaar kar rahaa he

" '' agle saptaah id ke aasapaas pratibandhaatmak aadesh hataa die jaaenge, tab sthiti spasht ho jaaegi
 There are already reports that five jaish-e-mohammed militants infiltrated the valley a fortnight ago

 Till now, all the hill states have been banning the ownership of land in their state by outsiders, so the abolition of this system from Jammu and Kashmir could open a clutter box
 haalanki vyavsaayee ab tak bahari logon dwaara bhoomi kii kharid par pratibandh or suraksha se jude khatre ko rajya main nivesh ke raste kii pramukh baadhaaen bataate rahe hai, lekin jammu-kashmir ke purv vitt mantri haseeb drabu kaa tark he ki samasya vivaadaaspad anuchhed 370 or 35e se nahin he‚Äîbalki sanyukt raashtra dwaara 'kashmir ko die vivaadit tag' se he
 Drabu also points to the absence of Central Public Sector Enterprises (cpses) in the state
 ve kehete hai, ''sipiesai ke nivesh or jammu-kashmir ke vikaas ke str ke bich rank kaa str 0
 Is 87

 He said that the combined investment of the three cpses in the state is Rs 165 crore and it provides employment to only 21 people
 haalanki, vyapaarik netaaon ke ek samooh ne twit karke centre ke is kadam ke liye samarthan jataayaa he lekin jab tak kashmir main rajnatik sthirataa nahin aa jaati, tab tak unki ore se bade nivesh kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Though the implementation of Right to Information (RTI) and reservation in the state is not an encouraging step for businessmen, but the fact that the Supreme Court verdict will now apply to Kashmir, it will increase their confidence that they are under pressure to enforce the terms of the contracts

 aktubar main bijness summit yojit karne kii baat chal rahi he
 However, experience says that there is a huge gap between the announcements and the ground reality, so this summit is likely to have little impact on the ground economics
 fark padegaa rajya main centre ke bade aarthik package kii ghoshnaa se
 Last time, the Vajpayee government at the Center announced a big package for Kashmir and this gave a big boost to the economy of the valley
 modi sarkaar ke liye is kshetra ke liye iity, iiem or ek badi bijli pariyojna kii ghoshnaa karnaa mahatvapurn hoga, kyonki isse nijee kshetra nivesh ke liye utsahit ho saktaa he
 And despite the withdrawal of Article 370, security officials feel that the Kashmiri Pandits will find it difficult to return quickly given the tension in the valley and the activism of the terrorists
 zyada se zyada yahi ho saktaa he ki unhen pratikaatmak rup main kadi suraksha ke bich kuch khaas sthanon par basaaya jaae
 Apart from these technological changes, what can have a major impact in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir is the government's decision to set up a commission to begin the exercise of delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir
 parisemen janasankhyikee main parivartan ke aadhaar par nirvachan kshetron kii simaaen tay karne kii prakriya he
 In 2002, the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly passed a law prohibiting new delimitation of seats by 2026
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki parisemen se ghani aabaadi vaale or hindu bahul jammu kshetra main nirvachan kshetron kii sankhya bad jaaegi, jisase bhaajapa ko laabh hoga
 Former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti says, "the intention of the central government is clear and scary
" yah desh ke ekmaatr muslim bahul rajya kii janasankhyikee ko badalanaa chaahati he, or musalamaanon ko is had tak laachaar kar dene ko amada he ki ve apane hi rajya main doum darje ke naagarik banakar rah jaaen
 Legal screw congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi called the dilution of Article 370 a "legally flawed and politically surprising move"
 modi ke netritv vaali bhaajapa sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ko nirarthak bana dene ke liye 'kil switch' kaa upyog kiya he
 So on 5 August, when Home Minister Shah stood in the Rajya Sabha to give the most decisive blow to the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, he did not put a bill to amend the constitution, rather he kept the achievement achieved by an order of the President
 yah samvidhan (jammu or kashmir par lagu) aadesh, 2019 he, jo (jammu or kashmir ke liye), 1954 ke sanvaidhanik aadesh kaa sthaan letaa he
 The special status conferred on the State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 in the Constitution has been abolished with immediate effect by order of the President
 isi ke saath anuchhed 35e bhi nirast ho gaya he, kyonki yah anuchhed 370 se hi upja he jise 1954 main raashtrapati ke ek aadesh ke madhyam se prabhavi kiya gaya tha
 But will Article 370 be defunct with just one Presidential order? The Modi government had a good idea that it would be challenged in court
 anuchhed 370 kii teesri dhara bharat ke raashtrapati ko anuchhed ko niskriy yaa sakriy ghoshit karne kii shakti detii he, basharte jammu-kashmir samvidhan sabha uskaa anumodan kare
 But the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly was dissolved in 1956 after drafting the state constitution
 isse yah raay bani ki is anuchhed ko kabhi bhi radd yaa sanshodhit nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki samvidhan sabha ab maujuud nahin he
 The Supreme Court stated in April 2018 that despite being under the title 'temporary', Article 370 is not temporary
 1969 ke ek maamle main bhi, sheersh adaalat ne anuchhed 370 ko asthaayee maanane se inkaar kar diya tha or kaha tha ki ''ise kabhi bhi khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "the President's order to remove this barrier first adds a new section to Article 367, which deals with interpretation in relation to Jammu and Kashmir
" yah 'rajya kii vidhansabha' ko 'rajya kii samvidhan sabha' bana detaa he
 The assembly is adjourned, so the order says that any reference to the assembly will be considered in reference to the governor
 rajyapal centre dwaara niyukti hote hai or isliye ab sansad ko vidhansabha ke adhikaar praapt hai
 Jitendra Singh, Minister of State in the PMO, says, "legal opinion is taken
 vartmaan main, sansad rajya vidhansabha kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi he
 Constitution experts appear divided on the legal validity of this maneuver
 e
 Yes
 nooraani kaa kahana he, ''yah puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he
 After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in 1956, the power to repeal Article 370 was abolished
 '' haalanki, maharashtra neshnal lau uniwarsity main kanoon kii sahaayak professor shreya mishra or supreme court ke vakil rakesh dvivedi kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf koi bhi daleel tikegi nahin kyonki raashtrapati ke aadesh main takneekee khamiyaan nahin hai
 This is also the opinion of former Lok Sabha Secretary General Subhash Kashyap
 kashyap kehete hai, ''rajya, kendriya shashan ke adheen he, sansad kii vyakhya jammu-kashmir kii vidhayika ke rup main kii ja sakati he
 Therefore, no change requires the consent of the State Government
 ''shah ne rajyasabha main ek vaidhanik prastaav bhi paarit kiya he jisamen sifarish kii gai thi ki raashtrapati ek adhisuchana jari karke‚Äîanuchhed 370 kii dhara 3 kaa upyog karte hue‚Äîyah ghoshnaa karte hai ki anuchhed 370 ke sabhi praavdhaan niskriy ho jaaenge or jammu-kashmir rajya ke liye bhartiya samvidhan ke sabhi praavdhaan lagu honge
 This makes Article 370 null and void for all practical purposes, even if it is not repealed
 jabaki aisa prathit hota he ki sarkaar ne ''jammu or kashmir kii gaiyr-maujuud samvidhan sabha kii sahmati'' se nipatane kii disha main pukhta prayaas to kiye hai par samvidhan ke visheshgyon ne anuchhed 367 main ek nayaa cloj daalane kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaaya he kyonki yah samvidhan sanshodhan kii prakriya he
 It violates Article 368, which states that the Constitution can be amended only by introducing a bill in Parliament and passing and voting it by a majority of two-thirds of the members of both the Houses
 shah ne sansad main kaha, ''hamen paanch saal de do, or ham jammu-kashmir ko desh kaa sabase viksit rajya bana denge

 bijepi ke pradesh mahasachiv rajendra singh ne daawa kiya tha ki party un sabhi 22 siton par apane ummidavaar utaaregi jin par pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main use jeet hasil hui thi
 In response, the BJP was challenged by the JDU to show the elections in all 40 Lok Sabha seats without the credible and acceptable face of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 2014 main endie ko mili jeetbihar main raajnneetik halaat aise hai ki nitish ek ore bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kar khush nahin bataae ja rahe hai to bijepi bhi unke saath rajya main number tu kii haisiyat se nahin rahanaa chaahati
 After a long silence, Nitish is now openly expressing his views on the policies of the BJP government at the Center
 saath hi somvaar ko ek kaarykram main unhone kaha ki krime, karpshan or communalism se koi samjhauta nahin karenge
 At the same time, BJP is also feeling that if it stays with JDU, it may suffer a lot in the state
 jediu ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 2 siten hi mili thim, jabaki 40 loksabhaa siton vaale rajya main endie ko 31 siten mili thi, jisamen bijepi ne akele 22 seat apane naam kar lee thi

 ) By the way, Tonitish Kumar has refused
 'ab gunjaaish bachi kahaan he?' media ke sawaal par nitish kaa yahi jawaab tha
 The news came that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has advised the BJP to extend a hand of friendship with Nitish Kumar
 uske baad se hi atakalon or sambhaavnaaon kaa daur chal padaa
 The 17-year-old relationship between BJP and JDU broke up during the Lok Sabha elections last year
 vaise donon partiyon ke rishton main daraar to usee vakt aa gai thi jab nitish ne endie ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii salaah di
 After that the rhetoric from both sides started and this relationship came to an end when Narendra Modi was declared the Prime Ministerial candidate
 mana jaataa he ki modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke chalate hi nitish ne mukhyamantri kii kursi chodi or jithan ram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banaaya jise dobaaraa hasil karne ke liye unhen puri takat jhonk deni padi
 The official meeting of Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar was on 5 May 2012
 ek baar phir 26 march ko donon dilli main milane ja rahe hai
 However, on 26 February this year, Modi and Nitish met at Lalu Yadav's daughter's wedding
 darasal, 26 march ko ganga ke ganga safai ke masale par pradhanmantri ne uttarakhand, uttar pradesh, bihar or pashchim bengal ke mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaai he
 In response to a question, Nitish just told that he is reaching Delhi in connection with the meeting
 yani pradhanmantri se mulaakaat ke liye unhone alag se koi vakt nahin maanga he
 On Monday, a meeting of Sangh and BJP leaders was held at Nitin Gadkari's house in Delhi
 isi baithak main sangh ne nitish se dosti kii salaah di, lekin aakhri faisla bijepi par chhod diya
 Elections for the Bihar Legislative Assembly are due in November
 philhal sangh ko isi chunaav kii chintaa he
 Perhaps the results of the Delhi elections have raised the Sangh's concern
 lok sabha ke baad maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand or jammu or kashmir vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ne maidan main akele utarane kaa faisla kiya
 The BJP also formed a government in three states and became a partner in the Jammu and Kashmir government
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi sirf teen siton par simat gai
 The situation in Delhi may be different from the rest of the states, but the Modi wave has proved ineffective
 ab sangh aage risk lenaa nahin chahta or isiilie usne bihar kii taiyaari pehle se hi shuru kar di he
 Recently, the Sangh warned the BJP about Bihar besides West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh
 sangh ke survey main pataa chalaa ki upi main bhi halaat bijepi ke anukool nahin he, balki bispi vahaan behatar sthiti main he
 The BJP had also decided to lend support during Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's trust vote in Bihar
 maanjhi ne sadan main jane se pehle hi istipha de diya ye alag baat he
 Currently, Congress and RJD are joining hands with Nitish's party JDU in Bihar due to power equations
 lekin pataa chalaa he ki ek baar phir lalu or nitish ke bich sab kuch utana acha nahin chal rahaa he
 The role of Manjhi Factor is also being told in this
 kuch din pehle argedy ke ek netaa ne nitish ko salaah di thi ki unhen maanjhi ko up-mukhyamantri bana dena chahie, to duusare ne maanjhi ko party main hi shaamil karne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 In at least one case, Lalu's silence was considered his intention
 jaahir he ye sab nitish ko katai acha nahin laga hoga
 After Nitish takes over the reins, the Sangh feels that the electoral path for the BJP is getting a bit difficult
 isiilie sangh chahta he ki bihar vidhaan sabha chunaav main bijepi jediu ke saath gathbandhan kar le - or mil kar congress or argedy kaa muqabla kare
 Nitish has also softened his tone against Modi
 nitish ne kaha tha ki bihar ke liye vah kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar hai
 In politics, statements are given more and decisions are something else
 shaayad isiilie nitish ke inkaar main bhi ikraar ke sanket dekhe ja rahe hai
 Modi government has put Rs 12500 crore in its railway budget for passenger convenience

 New toilets will be built in stations and trains
 vimaanon kii tarj par trainon ke 17000 toilets ko bio toilet main tabdeel kiya jayega

 saamaanya dibbon main dustbin bhi lagaae jaaenge
 04
 mobile charging poinbhi tak keval rail ke asi or sleeper dibbon main hi mobile charging kii suvidha uplabdh thi
 But now along with increasing the mobile charging point in the sleeper, it has been approved to install new points in the general compartments as well
 bajet main railmantri ne iskaa ullekh kiya he
 Convenient stairs will be placed in the compartment to go to the upper berth
 taaki yatri aaraam se upar vaali berth par chadh sake
 05
 diziner bistaresi dibbon main milane vaale safed bistar or takie se bhi yatriyon ko chhutkaaraa milegaa

 06
 sahaytaor suraksha ke liye naenmbebhi tak yatri 139 number ko hi jaanate hai jo ki railway kaa aadhikarik poochtacha number he
 But now passengers will be able to use the number 138 directly from the car to file a complaint
 yahi nahin suraksha or kisi bhi acasmik halaat main yatri 182 par madad ke liye kol kar sakenge
 The Railway Minister believes that this will provide great convenience to the passengers
 07
 Pick and drop facility from IRCTC: Now, passengers will be able to book cabs from IRCTC to come and go anywhere from the station
 pine ke pani ke liye steshnon par water vending mashine lagaai jaaengi
 So that the passengers can get clean drinking water cheaply
 08
 There is a special emphasis on women safety in women safety vehicles
 mahilaon ke liye arakshit dibbon main sisitivi camere lagaae jaaenge
 Whatever arrangements will be made to increase the safety of women in trains will be spent from the Nirbhaya Fund
 09
 Locker facility will also be made available for passengers at locker facilities
 jise yatri khud hi istemaal kar sakenge
