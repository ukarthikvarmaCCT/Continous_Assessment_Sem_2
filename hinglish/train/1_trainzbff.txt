 The sensation spread when a maid's body was found in a bungalow in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh
 bangala ek five star hotel ke maalik kaa he
 The 35-year-old maid was killed by striking her head and neck with a sharp weapon
 vaardaat ke baad se hi bangale kaa ek suraksha guard faraar he
 Raised in the bungalow of Jagjit Singh Khanuja, the owner of a five-star hotel in Raipur, the housekeeper of the house behind the house was stunned when the blood-stained body of Sunny Nishad was recovered
 laash par keede, makode or chintiyaan lag chuki thi
 a corpse stained with blood was lying near the corpse
 mritka ke kapade ast vyast the
 It was evident from the first sight that he had something untoward
 kyonki ghar kaa pichhlaa hissaa viraan tha
 That must have been the reason that nobody heard Sajni's scream
 haalanki ghatana ke vakt bangale main aadha darjan karmchaaree maujuud the
 But surprisingly, neither one saw the attack nor the attacker
 police bangale main lage sisitivi kii footage khangaal rahi he
 Another security guard posted in the bungalow told the police that he had seen his fellow guard Sadheelal Diwakar go out of the bungalow about two to three hours before the news of the murder was received
 sandehi guard sadhelaal divakar mungeli jile kaa rahane vaala he
 Police is searching for him
 police ne panchnaame kii karrwai ke baad shav ko postmortem ke liye medical college bhej diya he
 Sajni is said to have two small children
 Her husband works in the fisheries department
 phundohar nivasee sajani nishad pichley dhai saal se is bangale main kaam kar rahi thi
 She used to go home everyday from 9 to 5 am after doing duty there
 jabaki shaq ke ghere main aayaa guard sadhelaal 6 saal se bangale memnaukrikar rahaa tha
 He lived in the same premises
 praathmik sabooton ko dekhne ke baad police guard ko hi aaropee maanakar chal rahi he
 The hotelier told the police that there was no one in his bungalow at the time of the incident

 On Tuesday, the Supreme Court changed its order in November 2016, saying that it is no longer required to play the national anthem before the film starts in the cinema hall
 haalanki court ne kaha ki nagarikon ko raashtra gaan ke pati sammaan dikhaanaa chahie
 When asked about this, Kajol said, "I cannot say anything to any other citizen of the country, but whenever i hear the national anthem, i stand up
" 2016 main jab supreme court ne order diya tha ki cinema haul main film shuru hone se pehle raashtra gaan bajaayaa jayega or vahaan maujuud audiyans ko sammaan main khadaa hona hoga, to is par hindi film industry ke kai logon ne aapatti jataai thi
 Because of this, Rani Mukerji's relationship with her sister Kajol? Kajol was talking to media at the launch of 'swachh Aadat Swachh Bharat' campaign
 event main unase sanetary napkin par sarkaar dwaara lagaae ja rahe tex ke bare main bhi poocha gaya
 While many actors have raised the demand of making sanitary napkins tax-free, Kajol seems to have avoided giving a direct reply on it
 photo share kar TROLL huin kaajol, camel hasan ne kaha- baksh dounhone kaha- main aarthik maamalon ke bare main zyada nahin jaanati
 As far as sanitary napkins are concerned, milk and rice are also taxed
 mujhe lagata he ki sarkaar ko pataa he ki kya sahi he
 Redmi Note 3, a popular smartphone from Xiaomi, whose next version is Redmi Note 4 and the company claims that it is the best selling smartphone in India
 phone kharaab hona aam baat he, lekin uskaa repere na hona ye thodaa ajeeb he
 Most problems occur to customers when they are asked for Rs 7,500 to get a smartphone purchased for Rs 10,000
 ise aap smartphone kharaab hona bhi nahin kah sakate hai, kyonki smartphone achche condishan main he or yah bilkul nae smartphone kii tarah chal rahaa he
 But suddenly the charging stopped and when the customer goes to the service center, he is first told that there will be talk for about 500-600 rupees
 lekin thodi der main pataa chalata he ki unhen 7,500 rupee dene honge
 After listening to this, the customer has two options, either get the phone made or buy a new phone at the same price
 kyonki 7,500 rupee main Redmi Note 3 jaise hi spacifications vaale smartfones bazaar main maujuud hai
 The latest case is Ranjit Singh, a resident of Noida, who bought Redmi Note 3 on Diwali last year
 unke mutabik unhone ise hameshaa original charger se charge kiya or power bank bhi shaomi kaa hi kharida
 Suddenly the phone stopped charging
 phone banavaane wo noida ke shaomi athoraiced sarvice centre satguru communication jate hai
 It is said earlier that the smartphone will be repaired
 thodi der main sarvice centre vaale ne kaha ki charging point kharaab ho gaya he or iske liye aapako 7,500 rupee dene honge
 This is because the company will replace the entire motherboard and the component cannot be changed
 ranjit singh ke liye yah kaaphi hairaani bharaa tha, kyonki unhone yah smartphone diwali ofer ke tahat lagbhag 10,000 main kharida tha
 Such a situation can surprise anyone
 kyonki phone kii sthiti bilkul acchhee he or sirf charging jaik ke liye 7,500 rupee dene ho rahe hai
 He told us, 'the service center has given a bill for this, on which it is written that it will take 7,500 rupees to build it
 yah saraaras scam he, kyonki sirf charging jaik ke liye main 10,000 rupee ke phone ke liye 7,500 rupee maangana kahaan tak sahi he? itane main nayaa smartphone kharida ja saktaa he
 This attitude by the service center has caused further trouble and told us that the company should take action in this regard
 kyonki charging na hone kii sthiti main 7,5000 rupee diya janaa bilkul galat he
 Significantly, this smartphone is in good condition, no physical damage has been done
 is ghatana se smartphone sarvice kii sthiti par kai sawaal khadey jarur hote hai

 The ICC on Friday informed about the reshuffle made in connection with the World Cup

 The three teams will play all their matches in their own country until the knockout round of this World Cup
 logart ne kaha, "aane vaale dinon main kamatar ranking vaali tiimon ko vishwa cap main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 This format requires more and more skillful players

 unki job parformens par bhi iskaa bura asar padataa he
 According to a study done at Washington University, if someone stays on the smartphone even at night, then it has a direct effect on their morning
 harvard bijness rivyuu main prakashit research paper ke mutabik ye sach he ki smartphone logon ko chust durust rakhane main madadgaar hote hai
 But for this, choosing the right time is also necessary
 agar aap der shaam tak phone kii screen par kabhi kaam, to kabhi aaraam ke lihaaj se nazren tikaae rahete hai, to agali subah aap chidchidapan or thakaan mahasoos kar sakate hai
 Late night smartphone use also affects sleep quality
 agar neend behatar nahin hogi, to agali subah tanaav se bhari hona tay he
 According to the researcher, smartphones keep our brains very active
 agar der raat tak in par kaam kiya jaae, to bistar par jane ke baad bhi dimagi sakriyata bani rahati he
 In such a situation, the necessary rest for good sleep is not available
 natijatan, sharir kii bydaree neend ke jariye kam charge ho paati he
 Research suggested that today's smart managers must decide their dependence on smartphones creatively
 masalan, din ke kisi ek tay vakt main vah smartphone se khud ko dur kar len
 Or do not check the phone during that time
 isse kaaryakshmata behatar hogi
 It will be like a short break
 isi tarah email kaa jawaab dene ke liye bhi ek timeline banane se chijen behatar ho sakati hai

 Recently, Reliance, which has launched Jio's big bang, has said that the problem of 10 crore call drops is coming out every day
 reliance ne deshbhar ke tamaam telecom operataron ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki ye samasya hal karne ko lekar apane asli iraade nahin jaahir kar rahe hai
 Reliance has issued a statement saying that more than 80 percent of Jio's calls are failing
 haalanki kol drop kii samasya keval jeeyo kenetworkapar hi nahin he
 In July, TRAI said that most networks are violating the guidelines necessary to ensure a 2 per cent call drop
 jaaniye, kya he kol drop kii samasya or kyon hoti he kol karne main dikkat
 
 
 Call drop means when the conversation between two people talking on mobile is stopped without disconnection or no sound is heard from the other side
 yah takneekee kaarnon se hota he
 These are the main reasons for call drop in mobile network: 1
 radio kawarej kii kami (yaa to dowlink main yaa aplink main)2
 Radio Interruption Between Individual Subscribers 3
 network kaa sahi tareeke se kaam nahin karnaudaaharan ke taur par agar aap ek jagah se duusari jagah jate hai to aapako bas / metro badalane kii jarurat hoti he, agar diarect bas / metro seva nahin he to
 Similarly, if you go from one place to another, then your mobile network also has to change its radio channels
 agar network ko sahi channel nahin mili to bhi kol drop kii samasya aati he
 4
 kol dropahona mobile handset ke hardware kii quality par bhi nirbhar karata he
 5
 iske alaava aasapaas kii jagah par bijli ke khule taron kii vajah se bhi dikkat hoti he
 6
 ded spots: kuch jagahon par mobile signal bahut kamjor hote hai
 These are called dead spots
 7
 Call drop also occurs due to frequent signal movement or network jam
 8
 Sometimes SIM cards are also responsible for call drop
 agar sim card par scrtch padaa ho, ganda ho yaa muda hua ho to kol main dikkat hoti he
 Reliance Jio is facing problem 1
 reliance inter conection kaa formula tay nahin ho paa rahaa he
 TRAI has said that the telecom companies should sort it out among themselves
 2
 The solution is to give companies a 'point of interconnect'
 lekin keemton ko lekar pench fansaa he
 3
 tri kaa maananaa he ki inter conection ke liye sarkaar ko dakhal dena padegaa
 Airtel and other GSM network operators are facing problems: 1
 telecom operataron ne yugers kii sankhya badhane ke saath bade paimaane par nivesh nahin kiya
 2
 imaaraten zyada ban rahi hai
 According to that, mobile towers are not available
 3
 There is no inbuilding solution
 4
 The number of subscribers is increasing
 5
 Three generations are sitting in the same tower
 6
 The services of 2G and 3G are being affected due to the arrival of 4G
 samaadhaan:1
 The lack of space for toweling will have to be overcome
 2
 Companies will be forced to invest in network expansion
 3
 Which company will have the details of how many subscribers
 4
 In-building solutions need to be addressed
 haalanki, in upayon ko hakeekat main badalanaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Hence the problem of call drop will remain in future

 Rahul has said that PM Modi should tell the country the truth himself

 com / mayjvonboy shivasena ke saansad rabindra gaekwad dwaara air india ke adhikari ke saath durvyavhaar ke baad sabhi airlines dwaara unki yatra par pratibandh lagaae jane kaa mudda somvaar ko sansad main uthaaya gaya
 Defending Gaikwad, Shiv Sena MP Anand Rao Adsool, referring to Kapil Sharma, said that drunk Dr Kapil Sharma can travel by air, only investigation is being done in his case, no ban has been imposed
 unhone sarkaar se maang kii ki is maamle main gambhirtha se jaanch kii jaae
 In the matter of banning travel by all airlines and banning them by all airlines for alleged behavior with the officer, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said in the Lok Sabha today that he did not even think in the dream that an MP would consider such a case i will be surrounded saath hi unhone kaha ki airlines kii suraksha se koi samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Gajapathi Raju also said that the DGCA (directorate General of Civil Aviation) rules make the safety of airlines a top priority and any type of violence can be a major disaster for airlines
 unhone kaha ki dijisie ko yah adhikaar praapt he ki vah kisi bhi yatri kaa vyavhaar niyamanuroop nahin hone par use vimaan yatra karne se roak sakati he
 Gajapati Raju said, "an MP is also a passenger and no passenger is discriminated against on the basis of separate category
 ’’ unhone kaha ki airlines ne jo kadam uthaaya vah suraksha ke maddenjar uthaaya gaya or airlines kii suraksha se koi samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Shiv Sena MP Anand Rao, however, was not satisfied with this reply from the minister, and came in front of the seat with other members
 jab adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne kaha ki ve galat baat kaa samarthan kar rahe hai or mantri unke sawaal ko jawaab de chuke hai
 When the Speaker asked the Adsool and other Shiv Sena mps to resolve the matter by talking to the Aviation Minister, all the mps went to their respective places and the Adsool started talking to the Aviation Minister
 kuch der baad shivasena ke sabhi saansad sadan se uthakar chale gaye, haalanki unhone walkout kii ghoshnaa nahin kii
 Earlier in Zero Hour, Anand Rao Adsool raised the issue saying that there was a dispute in business class with Gaikwad and an airline official misbehaved with him
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main maanata hum ki adhikari ko maarna galati thi
 An FIR has also been registered in this
 us par hamen koi aapatti nahin he
 The objection is that all airlines have banned traveling with their aircraft
 ’’ adsul ne kaha ki yah pratibandh samvidhan ke tahat har naagarik ko pradutt desh main kahin bhi aane jane ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan he

 Even then Mahendra Singh Dhoni was struggling alone against Team India by scoring 65 runs against Australia

 He does not have new notes, so he is unable to bring fertilizer and seeds, leaving the fields empty

 Jwala Prasad planted water after plowing the field five times for sowing the rabi crop
 uske suukh jane ke baad phir teen baar khet ko jot kar jab buaai kii taiyaari karne ke liye beej or khaad laane ke jugad main lage to achaanak note bandi kii khabar aa gai
 So, despite having old notes in the house, the seeds could not bring manure and the field remained empty
 jwaala prasad se jab hamane poocha ki khet khaali kyon hai to chhutate hi bole 'na to khaad ba na to beej ba, kahin nayaa note nahin he, kahin koi de nahin rahaa, ham 2 bigha khet jot kar taiyaar hai, beej nahin he kya karen, badi pareshaani he
 The sowing of the Rabi crop due to the closure of old notes is affecting not only the farmers but also the agricultural laborers

 Chanrama and his family are agricultural laborers

 total amount of 2200 rupees of manure, then wheat seed 1 bigha It takes 40 kg, which is 32 rupees kg i

 32 x 40: 1280 rupees
 khet taiyaari se lekar buaai tak 8 dafe 4000 rupee
 Along with this, there is an expenditure of 1500 rupees on wages and medicine, that is, about 9000 rupees is spent in 1 bigha field
 agar 5 bigha khet main ham gehun laga rahe hai to hamen 45000 hazaar rupee chahie jabaki ham 4500 sau rupee hi nikaal sakate he
 And they are also unable to meet

 The government has made arrangements for the distribution of its seeds
 banaras ke viapeeth blaak main lagbhag 9700 hectare khet main kheti hoti, lihaaja uske hisaab se beej mangaya gaya
 The center's warehouse is full of sacks of seeds but the buyer is not a farmer
 is centre main 500 quintal gehun kaa beej aayaa
 The note was sold 276 quintals before the closure, but did not sell after that
 ye log bhi beej bhi nahin manga paa rahe hai kyonki tregeri puraane note nahin le rahaa he
 To investigate this problem of farmers, when we reached Banaras, the farmer Jwala Prasad, who came out of his field after preparing the paddy crop for sowing of Rabi, was seen draining it with a heavy heart
 jwaala prasad ne rabi kii fasal kii buaai ke liye paanch dfa khet kii jutai ke baad pani lagaaya
 After it dried up, after plowing the field three times, when engaged in the jugaad of bringing seeds and manure to prepare for sowing, there was a sudden news of note closure
 lihaaja ghar main puraane note hone ke baavjood bhi beej khaad nahin laa paae or khet khaali rah gaya
 When we asked Jwala Prasad that why the fields were empty, he said as soon as he left, 'neither manure nor seed is there, there is no new note, no one is giving it, we are ready to cultivate 2 bigha fields, no seeds
 Do it is a big problem
 puraane note band hone se rabi kii fasal kii buaai kaa asar sirf kisaanon par hi nahin khetihar mazdooron par bhi pad rahaa he
 Next to Jwala Prasad's house was Chanrama Devi, who was beating paddy with Ram Dhani
 chanarma or unka parivaar khetihar majdoor hai
 At this time, it is their time to earn from the Rabi crop, but if there is no sowing in the fields, then they are doing the work of beating the paddy, but the sadness is that if the sowing stopped like this then the effect of their own stove May fall on tippaniyan Asked by Chanrama Devi that this is the wages of us
 yahi kaam nahin hoga to kya hoga
 There is a problem due to the closure of the note and farmers are also having trouble due to the limit of getting new notes

 If we are planting wheat in a 5 bigha field, then we need 45000 thousand rupees whereas we can extract only 4500 hundred rupees

 ramlila main mahabharat
 This is what happened late night in Baba Ramdev's hunger strike in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan
 aadhi raat ke vaqt jab hindustan so rahaa tha
 When most of the Baba supporters present in the pandal were sleepy
 bhartiya police ne apana barbar cheharaa ek baar phir apni hi janata ko dikhaaya or laathiyon, aansu gas ke golon or taaqat ke boote sava do ghante ke andar wo satyagrah khatm kara diya jise rokane ke liye manmohan sarkaar pichley chaar dinon se lagi hui thi
 On the strength of sticks, the police suppressed the Satyagraha
 raat ke andhere main hue is police karrwai kii tulana ramdev or unke samarthakon ne jaliyanvaala cond se kii jab angrezon ne amritsar main jamaa nihathe logon par goliyaan chalaai thim
 After this action, which lasted from about one o'clock in the middle of the night to four in the morning, the police confirmed that Baba Ramdev was taken into custody
 unke qareebi sahyogi baalkrishna ko bhi hiraasat main lekar agyaat thikaane par le jaaya gaya
 According to sources, there are reports that Baba Ramdev has been sent to Gurgaon
 police kii karrwai main kai ramdev samarthakon ke ghayal hone kii khabar he
 The police emptied the entire pandal set up for the yoga camp around four o'clock and extinguished the lights there

 The CBI will present Shashi Singh before the court today and seek his remand
 sibiai ne shashi singh or aaropee vidhayak kuldeep senger ko aamane-saamne bithakar bhi poochtacha kii
 The CBI can also take Kuldeep Sengar to Unnao for questioning today
 or agar shashi singh kii remand mil jaati he to use bhi unnav le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The CBI took Shashi Singh into custody late Saturday and after a long interrogation, he was arrested this morning
 sibiai ke mutabik, giraftaar kii gai mahila shashi singh aaropee vidhayak kuldeep senger kii sahyogi rahi he
 The CBI said that the woman has been arrested on the basis of allegations of rape
 rape peedita ne aarope lagaaya he ki yahi mahila ghatana vaale din use unnav ke bangaramau se BJP vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ke ghar le gai thi
 Earlier on Saturday evening, Kuldeep Sengar was presented before the court
 court ne kuldeep senger ko7 din kii hiraasatamen bhej diya he, haalanki sibiai ne court se kuldeep ke liye 14 din kii hiraasat kii maang kii thi
 Meanwhile, while going to court, Kuldeep Sengar told the media that he has full faith in the court
 shanivaar ko aaropee kuldeep senger or peedita kaa lakhanu ke lohia aspataal main medical karavaaya gaya
 During the therapy, the victim complained of dizziness and weakness
 kuch hafte pehle mere paas ek purv chaatr kaa phone aayaa, jisane haal hi main america se ganit main piechdi puri kii thi
 He looked very happy
 use texas main huston ke mashhoor em
 D
 anderson cancer centre main research scientist kii pehali naukari mil gai thi
 There is nothing unique in this
 isi tarah do saal pehle ek or purv chaatr ne mujhe khush hokar phone kiya tha, jab use ganit main piechdi karne ke baad pratishthit jon hapakins uniwarsity skool of medicine main pehali naukari mili thi
 i have started realizing that the world is now welcoming young talents who have some good aptitude in mathematics
 isi tarah ganit main piechdi kar chukaa ek anya yuva landan kii ek vittiya company main acchhee naukari kar rahaa he
 Two more students with similar backgrounds are doing well in a large multinational data analytics company in Mumbai
 dilli main mere college ke dinon ke ek mitra, jisane ganit main degree lee thi, is samay vishwa kii ek atyant pratishthit uniwarsity main distungushd professor of iconomics hai
 a strange similarity between all these is that many of them were also offered lucrative jobs in engineering companies and they all knew well that they could get jobs in the field of education as well
 baharhaal, safalataa paane ke liye ganit main piechdi hona jaruri nahin he
 What i want to say is that even basic training in mathematics can bring you great success
 is baat kii jaanch-parakh karne ke liye maine teen saal ke un chaatro kii jaankaree hasil kii, jo dilli ke ek khaas college se cat (sieti) kii pariksha main safal rahe the
 i found that the highest number of successful students had undergraduate degrees in mathematics
 ek badi ity company ke sansthaapak ne ek baar mujhe bataaya tha ki jin chaatro ke paas ganit ke vishay main kam se kam undergraduate degree thi or jinhone koding main training le rakhi thi, unhone unki company main or duusari jagahon par ejineering ke chaatro ke mukaable kahin acchhee safalataa hasil kii thi
 Many times the best coding systems are invented using basic fundamentals of mathematics, and good coding and inventors — such as for RSA algorithms — achieve tremendous success in terms of jobs
 aaj duniya main sabase acchhee jagahon par baithe creative ejeeniyar yaa medical research ganit ke hi chaatr rahe hai, jo koding main maharath rakhte hai
 Basic knowledge of mathematics is also very useful and in today's world, its importance is constantly increasing
 ab sawaal he ki aakhir ganit kis tarah phydemand sabit hota he
 There are many reasons for this
 pehla, ganit aadmi ke lagbhag sabhi kshetron or gatividhiyon main kaam aata he or yah prakruti main samahit he
 Therefore, people who have aptitude in mathematics, use it like a lens to understand things and make it useful
 iske alaava ganit kaa adhyayan logon ko taarkik banaata he or ve data kaa vishleshan bahut kushalta se kar lete hai
 Obviously, it gets its full advantage in coding
 ye bahut upyogi yogyataayen hai
 i would also like to mention here that mathematics is a very useful thing in the practical world as well
 maine kisi ek saal main unki kamai par najar daalate hue ek badi bhartiya ity company or google kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya
 Although the Indian IT company was far older than Google and had more employees, its full-year earnings were less than Google's quarterly earnings
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki google ko ganitiya idia kii takat hasil he, jo stenford uniwarsity ke chaatro kii dein he, jabaki bhartiya ity company ke saath aisa nahin he
 It is very important to understand this difference
 isliye ganit aapako jindagi main badi safalataa dilaa saktaa he
 Today, when the emphasis is on new discovery and innovation, mathematics is of most use

 da best hai dhoni
 
 
 Shami said that due to his support, this Bengal fast bowler became a bowler from domestic to international level with great ease
 shami ne toornament main ab tak bharat kii ore se sabase zyada 12 wicket liye hai
 Shami was asked what contributed to Dhoni in his two-year international career, saying, 'I love the way he leads the team and the way he handled me as a bowler
 maine sabhi format main unke netritv main debyue kiya
 Whenever he is captaining, i do not remain tense
 main bahut aaraam se kheltaa hum
 "he is not one of those captains who demand anything from me," he said before the match against Zimbabwe
 vah aise captain hai jo mujhe meri galtiyaan ke bare main bataate hai or bhavishya main unhen nahin dohraane ke liye kehete hai
 He never gets angry
 vah badi shanti se apni baat rakhte hai or sthiti kaa saamana karte hai jisase gendbaajon ko madad milti he
 In the dressing room of Team India more comfortable than Bengal, Hashmi said that it is important for any bowler to get the support of the captain and Dhoni is doing this
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki apni gharelu team (bengal) ke bajaay vah bhartiya dressing room main adhik sahaj mahasoos karte hai
 He said, 'despite the mistakes, the captain's support is very important and Dhoni does it
 yah mere liye acchhee baat he ki maine unki captaini main debyue kiya
 "plan a does not work, then Plan b does
 Ushami was asked how the Indian fast bowling unit is implementing its strategy, due to which they have dismissed the opposing teams in five matches so far," he said
 It depends on what the circumstances are and what your strategy is
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘aapako ranneeti par kaam karke uske anusaar gendbaaji kerani hoti he
 Being a bowler, you have your own strategy and plan for the captain
 aapako gendbaaji karte samay donon apane dimag main rakhane hote hai
 We follow these strategies
 agar ‘plan e’ nahin chal paata he to phir ‘plan bi’ ko aajamaate hai
 'part of a good bad form game, the Indian bowlers had a very poor performance in the Australian tour, but they made a great comeback
 shami ne kaha, ‘acha or bura daur khel kaa hissaa he or cricketer ke rup main aapako achche or bure dinon se guzarana padataa he
 It has been a long tour for me
 test match khelte hue aapaki maansikta or practice formet ke mutabik hota he
 In this way the mindset keeps on changing
 ’bure dinon ko bhul janaa chahie
 
 
 He said, 'it is not difficult
 ham junior nahin he jahaan aapako kuch chijen sikhaayi jaati he
 We change our mindset according to the format of the game
 bure dinon ko yaad karne se aapaki soch prabhavit hogi
 It is better to think ahead

 The Supreme Court today stayed the execution of the death sentence of lashkar-e-taiba terrorist Mohammad Arif alias Ashfaq in the Lalkila attack case in 2000
 is hamale main sena ke do javaanon sahit teen log maare gaye the
 a bench headed by Chief Justice RM Lodha also issued a notice to the Center on Arif's application
 aarif ne apane aavedan main is aadhaar par apni rihaai kaa nirdesh die jane kaa aagrah kiya tha ki vah pehle hi 13 saal se zyada samay jail main guzaar chukaa he or itani lambii avadhi ke baad use faansee nahin di jaani chahie
 He said that the execution of his death sentence would mean punishing him twice for the crime, as he had already spent more than 13 years in prison which is almost equivalent to life imprisonment
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki aarif nyaay prakriya main hue lambey vilamb or sarkaar kii ore se sajaa ke karyanvayan main hui deree kii vajah se shaareerik or maansik beemaari se grast he
 On 10 August 2011, the apex court rejected Arif's appeal while upholding his death sentence
 aarif ko satr nyaayalay ne maut kii sajaa sunai thi, jisaki pushti dilli hoicourt ne kii thi
 The Supreme Court upheld the death sentence, saying the attack was an audacious attempt by Pakistan to terrorize India and a war against the country
 aarif ne 13 july 2007 ke hoicourt ke faisle ko chunauti di thi, jisamen uski maut kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya tha, lekin alag-alag sajaa paane vaale chah anya ko bari kar diya tha
 The High Court had dismissed Arif's appeal filed against the judgment of the lower court

 Police search operation continues on Saturday at the camp of Gurmeet Ram Rahim in Sirsa
 is dauraan police ne dere parisar ke andar se visphotak jabt kiye hai
 Deputy Director of Public Relations Department of Haryana Government Satish Mishra also said that an illegal firecracker factory was also running inside the dera premises, which has been sealed
 vahiin dere ke bheetar se nar-kankalon ko dabaae jane kii khabaron ko lekar jab mishra se poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki abhi is bare main kuch bhi nahin bataaya ja saktaa he
 a team of experts has been called to investigate the matter
 darasal sirsa sthit deraa parisar bahut hi bada he or vahaan ravivaar se hi khudaai kaa kaam shuru ho paaegaa
 It may take a lot of time to research the roots of Ram Rahim, who describes himself as a self-proclaimed saint, and by then the search team will also be engaged in the campaign
 dere se mili ye saamaan- search team ko 1200 nae note, 7000 puraane note mili hai jinaki kul keemat chand hajaar se zyada nahin hogi

 ho saktaa he inkaa istemaal samarthakon ko jhansa dene main hota ho
 - Two rooms of Dera Sacha have been sealed by the search team
 - dere se 2 naaballig samet 5 log mili
 This is just the beginning
 ram rahim ke adharmkandake kai adhyay aage khulenge
 But there is a big question that this search campaign has started after 15 days
 chashmadid kah rahe hai baba ne trakon main bhar-bharkar jurm ke saboot deraa se baahar bhej die hai
 - Around 10:30 on Friday morning, the search team entered the Dera Sacha Sauda
 - search team pehali baar gurmeet singh ke us rahasyamayi gupha main bhi daakhil hui jiske bare main kai kahaniyaan hai
 - The search team also searched Ram Rahim's meditation center
 - deraa ke bheetar bane printing press, guest house, emsiji mart kii chaanbin se bhi search team ko kai saboot mili hai
 - Ram Rahim has named the garment factory in the name of Hanipreet, the search team also went there
 ajtak ke 5 samvaadadaataaon ne is mega search oparation ko puure din follow kiya
 For the first time pictures inside Dera Sacha have come out
 jisamen ram rahim kii akut daulat kaa bhi raaj khul rahaa he
 It took 15 days to get permission from the court and security preparations
 puraa khatra he ki baba ke chelon ne is dauraan sabooton par haath saaf kar die hai
 It is difficult to say that Baba will be under siege on the first day of search
 - deraa headquarter main talaashi abhiyaan ke liye satellite ke jariye deraa kaa map nikaala gaya
 - Action plan prepared by dividing into different parts

 - 41 companies of Para Military Forces deployed

 - 7 IPS and 100 Investigation Officers were called
 ye suchi behad lambii he, search abhiyaan main bam skwantd, swat tak kii tukdi tainaat kii gai he
 But the most important thing is that Sirsa and its supporters should be freed from Ram Rahim's terror
 ram rahim ke jail jane ke baad bhi uske bare main baat karne se log darate hai

 skulon par jansunwaayee jari he
 Avoid schools named Millennium, International, Global
 in naamon vaale kai skulon main fees vruddhi kii jagah faansee vruddhi hoti he
 i am telling this after reading thousands of emails sent by parents
 gali-gali main milinium or global skool khul gaye hai
 Today, reading all the emails, we have come to know some more new acts of schools, whose list i am presenting to you in this public hearing
 gudgaanv ke ek skool main har saal 350 rupee kii dictionari leni hi padati he
 a school in Orissa does not provide any receipt for re-admission, ie black money
 rudki kaa ek skool sabhi bacchon se har din hand sanitiser lekar aane ko kahata he
 In a school in Mathura, Rs 550 is charged in the name of e-service, for email and SMS
 khetri nagar rajasthan kaa ek skool diary ke liye 700 rupee le rahaa he
 The school in Aligarh refused to accept the fees in cash, but took advanced checks for four quarters
 gudgaanv ke ek skool ne 40 fisadi or lakhanu ke ek skool ne 60 fisadi fees badha di he
 300 to 500 rupees were taken from students at a school in Ludhiana during the floods of Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, Nepal earthquake
 chaatro ko chande kii koi raseed nahin di gai
 a school in Ahmedabad charges fees in the name of extra activity but does not have a play ground
 yah sab darshakon ke bheje gaye email se pataa chalaa he
 His experiences are documented
 hamane skool se check nahin kiya, in sabake paas rata rataya jawaab hota he
 Complaints have come from schools of leaders of every party
 ek baat samajni hogi
 Schools require money to run
 fees vaazib bhi badhaai ja sakati he magar 60 pratishat se lekar 100 fisadi fees vruddhi kii baat samaj nahin aati
 Parents' earnings do not increase that much
 dilli, mumbai yaa anya shaharon ke pratishthit skulon kii fees to samaj aati he magar maine jo email padhe hai uske aadhaar par kah saktaa hum ki garib ilaakon main bhi skool vahi fees vasuul rahe hai jo bade shaharon ke bade skool vasuulate hai
 Sonbh in UP is a poor area, but the fees of a school here has been stated as 8000 per month
 maharashtra kaa nandurbaar garib ilaaka he lekin ek skool kii fees 40 fisadi bad gai
 It should not run
 chhattisgarh ke bastar main sirf naksal samasya nahin he vahaan bhi skulon kii aisi lut chal rahi he
 Emails have also come from Korba, Jagdalpur, Kanker
 vaise navi mumbai ke ek abhibhavak ne keji class ke bachche kii fees ke liye bank se personal lone lene kii baat kahi he
 People's beliefs are awakened by this public hearing of ours
 punjab se ek bank karmchaaree ne email kiya he ki unke bank main kuch privet skool ke account hai
 Schools deposit Rs 15,200 from their current account to a teacher's account
 saath hi saath unheen shikshakon ke sin kiye hue check bhi lekar aate hai or 15,200 rupee nikaal lete hai
 Then the school gives a salary of 4000 or 5000 rupees in cash
 jo awaz uthaata he usase kaha jaataa he ki aap naukari chhod do
 In my opinion, do not celebrate Teachers' Day this year
 gulam kii tarah aapke shikshakon ke saath vyavhaar ho rahaa he or ham shikshak diwas ke maukey par lacture dete hai
 Surprisingly, there is another matter
 bahut kam shikshakon ne email kiye hai
 Whatever matches have come from the teachers of government schools
 unke patron ko padhakar yahi laga ki us kharaab system main bhi koi jinda he
 Reading all the emails, i know what is happening within hundreds of schools in the country
 itnaa to puri jindagi laga detaa to bhi nahin jaan paata
 Thank you audience

 i am going to delete the email so that no one can touch it

 At Mumbai's Azad Maidan, some parents have started a hunger strike against the government
 unka kahana he ki mumbai ke saat skulon ne bina abhibhavakon kii sahmati ke fees badha di jo maharashtra skool fees regulation act kaa ulanghan he
 In the mid-day of April 18, the statement of Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde has been published that schools with CBSE and ICSE board do not come under the state government, under the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, so why are the parents blaming us for increasing fees Huh
 unka yah bayaan kai akhabaaron main chapa he
 Similarly, the parents in Aklera of Jhalawar, Rajasthan have submitted a memorandum to the district administration against the arbitrariness of schools
 desh ke kai jiladhikariyon ke paas aise gyaapan die gaye hai jisase pataa chalata he ki sthiti kitni chintajanak he
 The Gujarat law is being talked about, but many emails have come from there, which shows that even after setting the maximum limit, schools are charging more than that
 ludhiana main bhi kuch mata-pita ne privet skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf disi aphis ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 a pamphlet from Bokaro in Jharkhand states that a shoe-slipper rally has been organized against the arbitrariness of schools there

Kamal didi arrived in Alwar to meet the youths who were accused of killing Peerkhar Khan
 camel didi ne hatya ke aropiyon ko aaj ke bhagat singh or sukhdev kaha he
 i am sure that if someone insults a martyr, then Kamal Didi will not forgive him, but by describing an accused as martyrs Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev, they have increased their stature, whom have they insulted, you disarm
 aise to ab bhagat singh ko bhi poochna padegaa ki main hi hum yaa koi or bhagat singh ho gaya he
 Didi is going to agitate with all the cow devotees
 vaise jo aaropee he use aaropee hi samajhnaa chahie, sazaayaftaa nahin
 On the other hand, instead of supporting the person who has been killed, the Meo leaders have disappeared
 jab koi nahin aayaa to saddaam hossain jaise navayuvakon ne mevaat yuva sanghathan bana liya
 They have staged a protest from Jantar Mantar to Jaipur for justice in the aspect of killing of Aspect Khan

 After reading his letters, it felt that someone was alive even in that bad system
 tamaam email ko padhate hue desh ke saikadon skulon ke bheetar kya ho rahaa he, jaan gaya hum
 Even if he had spent so much of his life, he would not have been able to know
 aap darshakon kaa shukriya
 i am not going to reveal anyone's identity
 kisi ko haath na lage isliye email delit karata ja rahaa hum
 Emails have been received from Mumbai, Ludhiana and Jharkhand
 mumbai ke aaazaad maidan main kuch abhibhavakon ne sarkaar ke khilaaf bhukh hadtaal shuru kii he
 He says that seven schools in Mumbai increased the fees without the consent of the parents, which is a violation of the Maharashtra School Fees Regulation Act
 18 april ke mid de main maharashtra ke shiksha mantri vinod taavade kaa bayaan chapa he ki sibiesai or isiesai board vaale skool rajya sarkaar ke tahat nahin aate hai, kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke tahat aate hai to abhibhavak hamen kyon fees badhane kaa doshi maan rahe hai
 His statement has appeared in many newspapers
 isi tarah rajasthan ke jhalawad ke akalera main abhibhavakon ne jila prashasan ko skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf gyaapan diya he
 Many District Magistrates of the country have been given such memoranda which shows how worrisome the situation is
 gujarat ke kanoon kii baat ho rahi he magar vahaan se kai email aae hai jinase pataa chalata he ki adhiktam seemaa tay karne ke baad bhi skool usase bhi adhik fees le rahe hai
 In Ludhiana too, some parents demonstrated outside the DC office against the arbitrariness of private schools
 jharkhand ke bokaro se aayaa ek parchaa bataata he ki vahaan skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf juuta-chappal raily nikaali gai he
 i am hearing such a name for a rally for the first time
 juuta-chappal raily
 Soon people will rally tie-belts
 tippaniyan a student has emailed that the school took 3000 per month for the preparation of JEE and NEET for two years so that an extra class can be done
 jabaki vah ejeeniyar or doctor bananaa hi nahin chahta tha
 Apparently, schools are being asked to buy a colored bag in the name of discipline and money is being taken in the name of most extra classes
 sibiesai ne 13 skulon ko notice jari kiya he
 Notices have been issued to DPS Bhopal, Peelers Public School Gorakhpur, Rajni Public School Bulandshahar, Bal Niketan Junior High School and Sir Syed Public School, Varanasi
 dilli ke bhi do skool hai deepies aarake puram or deepies mathura road
 There are different complaints against everyone
 sibiesai ne phir se doharaaya he ki skool kitaab, notebook, steshnari, unifarm nahin bechenge or board ke niyamon kaa paalan karenge
 School is not business but social service
 sabhi skulon se kaha gaya he ki ve ensiiarti yaa sibiesai kii kitabon kaa hi istemaal karen
 Do not force parents to buy separate books
 is tarah ke nirdesh to rajasthan ke shiksha mantri ne bhi jari kiye hai
 Now the question is that those who have been forced to buy things at a higher price, will their money be refunded? Those who have been asked to buy 2000 shoes instead of 800, will they be back? Does CBSE even have a mechanism to monitor all schools or do we just keep hoping? kendriya vidyalayon main shikshakon ke 10,000 pad khaali hai
 If we increase the amount of debit on hindu-muslim topics on TV, then there will be no need to ask that if there are so many posts vacant then how will studies be done? What would be the condition of unemployment due to their not being filled
 mujhe pataa he ki main kuch zyada bol rahaa hum lekin aapako hairaani nahin hoti ki har duusare din tivi par hindu-musalmaan taapic kahaan se aa jaataa he
 There are 10,039 vacancies of teachers in Kendriya Vidyalayas

 The school in Aligarh refused to accept the fees in cash, but took advanced checks for four quarters
 gudgaanv ke ek skool ne 40 fisadi or lakhanu ke ek skool ne 60 fisadi fees badha di he
 300 to 500 rupees were taken from students at a school in Ludhiana during the floods of Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, Nepal earthquake

 ek baat samajni hogi
 Schools require money to run
 fees vaazib bhi badhaai ja sakati he magar 60 pratishat se lekar 100 fisadi fees vruddhi kii baat samaj nahin aati
 Parents' earnings do not increase that much

 Then the school gives a salary of 4000 or 5000 rupees in cash
 jo awaz uthaata he usase kaha jaataa he ki aap naukari chhod do
 In my opinion, do not celebrate Teachers' Day this year
 gulam kii tarah aapke shikshakon ke saath vyavhaar ho rahaa he or ham shikshak diwas ke maukey par lacture dete hai
 Surprisingly, there is another matter
 bahut kam shikshakon ne email kiye hai

 tippaniyan a student has emailed that the school took 3000 per month for the preparation of JEE and NEET for two years so that an extra class can be done
 jabaki vah ejeeniyar or doctor bananaa hi nahin chahta tha
 Apparently, schools are being asked to buy a colored bag in the name of discipline and money is being taken in the name of most extra classes
 sibiesai ne 13 skulon ko notice jari kiya he
 Notices have been issued to DPS Bhopal, Peelers Public School Gorakhpur, Rajni Public School Bulandshahar, Bal Niketan Junior High School and Sir Syed Public School, Varanasi
 dilli ke bhi do skool hai deepies aarake puram or deepies mathura road
 There are different complaints against everyone
 sibiesai ne phir se doharaaya he ki skool kitaab, notebook, steshnari, unifarm nahin bechenge or board ke niyamon kaa paalan karenge
 School is not business but social service
 sabhi skulon se kaha gaya he ki ve ensiiarti yaa sibiesai kii kitabon kaa hi istemaal karen
 Do not force parents to buy separate books
 is tarah ke nirdesh to rajasthan ke shiksha mantri ne bhi jari kiye hai
 Now the question is that those who have been forced to buy things at a higher price, will their money be refunded? Those who have been asked to buy 2000 shoes instead of 800, will they be back? Does CBSE even have a mechanism to monitor all schools or do we just keep hoping? yah sab darshakon ke bheje gaye email se pataa chalaa he
 His experiences are documented
 hamane skool se check nahin kiya, in sabake paas rata rataya jawaab hota he
 Complaints have come from schools of leaders of every party
 ek baat samajni hogi
 Schools require money to run
 fees vaazib bhi badhaai ja sakati he magar 60 pratishat se lekar 100 fisadi fees vruddhi kii baat samaj nahin aati
 Parents' earnings do not increase that much
 dilli, mumbai yaa anya shaharon ke pratishthit skulon kii fees to samaj aati he magar maine jo email padhe hai uske aadhaar par kah saktaa hum ki garib ilaakon main bhi skool vahi fees vasuul rahe hai jo bade shaharon ke bade skool vasuulate hai
 Sonbh in UP is a poor area, but the fees of a school here has been stated as 8000 per month
 maharashtra kaa nandurbaar garib ilaaka he lekin ek skool kii fees 40 fisadi bad gai
 It should not run
 chhattisgarh ke bastar main sirf naksal samasya nahin he vahaan bhi skulon kii aisi lut chal rahi he
 Emails have also come from Korba, Jagdalpur, Kanker
 vaise navi mumbai ke ek abhibhavak ne keji class ke bachche kii fees ke liye bank se personal lone lene kii baat kahi he

 punjab se ek bank karmchaaree ne email kiya he ki unke bank main kuch privet skool ke account hai
 Schools deposit Rs 15,200 from their current account to a teacher's account
 saath hi saath unheen shikshakon ke sin kiye hue check bhi lekar aate hai or 15,200 rupee nikaal lete hai
 Then the school gives a salary of 4000 or 5000 rupees in cash
 jo awaz uthaata he usase kaha jaataa he ki aap naukari chhod do
 In my opinion, do not celebrate Teachers' Day this year
 gulam kii tarah aapke shikshakon ke saath vyavhaar ho rahaa he or ham shikshak diwas ke maukey par lacture dete hai

Kangana Ranot's talent can be gauged from the fact that she is the second actress after Shabana Azmi to have won two National Film Awards in a row
 lekin in dinon vah sirf is aword ko lekar hi charchaa main nahin hai or na hi 'rangoon' kii shooting ko lekar
 Known for her outspoken statements, the actress is surprised at the steps taken in the past
 kuch khamoshi se saath de rahe hai to kuch aaropon kii jhadi laga rahe hai
 It is being said that she had a legal battle with Hrithik Roshan over a 'bygone relationship' and in the meantime, one of her ex's to reveal that she does magic
 india today ke saath ek khaas baatcheet main kangana ne bahut kuch kaha or jo kaha, vah unki khubasurat shakhsiyat kii khubsuurati vaaki or badha gaya
 - You came into this line after quarreling with your father
 to teen neshnal aword jeetne par ek alag khushi hoti hogi
 i have always listened to the heart
 apni mehnat or apni niyat par bharosa rakhaa
 If the father did not support, then it was right for me in a way
 isse kuch kar dikhaane kaa jajba badha
 - Queen is royal and we always look at queens from a realm
 lekin aap steriotip tod rahi hai
 
 
 i have listened to my heart, which i thought was right, i did it
 papa apni jagah sahi honge or apni jindagi ke faisle maine khud liye
 It is true that i did not follow the path of others, but to break my rule was not to prove others wrong, but to prove myself right
 -hollywood jane kii kya aapaki bhi planning he
 
 
 i want to do films elsewhere too
 mujhe dekhne vaale darshakon kaa dayera bade
 But Hollywood itself is looking for a market elsewhere
 aise main main vahaan se kya ummid kar sakati hum
 At the same time, China and Bollywood films are making their way
 aise main hollywood kii bajaay international apil vaali filmein karnaa chaahuungi
 - You have not done a single film with Khan Trio yet
 
 
 jab mujhe vaaki ek super brake kii jarurat thi, tab mujhe in superstars ke saath kaam karne ke ofer nahin mili
 And now when i get offers, i want to do films according to myself
 bas kuch seen ke liye kisi film ko karne kaa kya tuk he
 In the industry, you ask for money equal to big heroes
 
 
 jab main kisi film ko puraa vakt or mehnat de rahi hum to kyon nahin main hero ke baraabar kii fees kii demand karun
 i do not say that i get as much money as Bade Khan, but yes, i take the fee of many mail actors or equal to them
 - aap bollywood kaa 'phase of feminism' ban chuki hai
 
 
 i am an artist and i will do the roles as i come
 'queen' jaisi filmein personal agenda hai or jo kar rahi hum, sab apane kariyar ke liye hi he
 So, i do not want to take any such credit
 - aapane ek intervyuu main sweekaara he ki aap aise rilations main rah chuki hai, jinamein aap maut ke munh tak pahunch sakati thim
 
 
 i am not ashamed of anything and i have nothing to hide
 mujhe munhfat kaha ja saktaa he lekin main sab saaf bolne waalon main se hum
 - Do mail actors make you nervous? 
 
 hamaare yahaan kaa maahaul aisa hi he ki mahilaon ko dabaaya jaataa he
 Take my house only
 mujhe yaad he jab ek baar mere dadaji ne mujhe dining teble se uthaakar kaha tha ki ladies baad main khaati hai
 What can we do with this now? - lekin aapako khule taur par kaala jaadu karne vaali kaha ja rahaa he
 
 
 i am also surprised by them
 yah sab samaaj kaa ek or cheharaa dikhaata he
 It shows a negative mindset
 mujhe psycopath,khun pine vaali,chudail jaise tag die gaye hai
 My question is, why are you imposing someone's allegation as an accusation on him
 mahilaon ko aise hi aarope se dabaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Always only
 phir chudail, dian jaise shabdon ko negative hi kyon liya jaataa he
 Don't we see Harry Potter? baaki jahaan meri baat he to gocip colums main mujhe apane period saaikal par artical padhane main koi takalif nahin he
 - What does not hurt by such allegations
 
 
 hota he
 If i stop and think, then i also get shocked
 phir main kisi ko tab sori nahin bol sakati, jab maine kuch galat nahin kiya ho
 - If a male partner is not able to do a good job, then its accustomed to women
 anoushka-viraat kaa udhaaharan hamaare saamne he
 
 
 When i had an acid attack on my sister, i was not serious about these issues before that
 lekin jab aapke saath aisa hota he to aap samaaj kii chizon ko lekar ankhen kholane lagate hai
 But somewhere behind this, the same thinking is that if i cannot find you or suppress you, then i will ruin you
 main un logon ke saath hum jo drug ediction se jujh rahe hai
 i have done such rolls
 ham aise logon ke liye nakaaratmak hi kyon sochate hai
 Why do we think to cut them off from society
 
 
 - koi aapke saath nahin, kya bura laga is baat kaa?bollywood main mere kuch wel vishars hai jinhone hameshaa meraa hausala badhaayaa he
 Then there is also support from social media
 - yah vivaad kaise khatm hota dekhnaa chaahati hai
 
 
 Now that everything has come to the fore, it is okay
 maine dekha he ki bade log zyada dikhaave vaale va jhuthe hote hai
 i am not wrong so i will not say sorry
 lekin kabhi-kabhi is sab par dukh hota he or ronaa bhi aata he
 But all this has to be faced
 khud ko majboot kar liya he
 i believe in people quickly
 lekin phir bhi khud ko badalanaa nahin chaahati

 beete kuch saalon main bharat or america ke bich gadhe rishte ke daawey kiye jate hai lekin ab america raashtrapati donald trump ke ek faisle ne in daavon par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 In fact, US President Trump has decided to end the GSP (generalized System of Preference) with India
 GSP khatm hone kaa matlab yah he ki bharat ab jin product ko america main bechega us par vahaan kii sarkaar tex lagaaegi
 Till now India exports some products without tax
 america ke is kadam ko dwipaksheeya rishton ke lihaaj se bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 When was GSP started? America started GSP in 1976
 iskaa makasad vikasshil deshon main aarthik vruddhi badhanaa tha
 It allows export of selected items to the US to other countries on duty-free or nominal tariffs
 vartmaan main bharat samet kareeb 129 deshon ko GSP kaa phayda mil rahaa he
 gsps benefit from more than 1800 small and large products in sectors such as Chemicals and Engineering in India
 yani bhartiya bazaar se ye product america bazaar main bina kisi tex yaa maamuli duty charge ke pahunchate hai
 Apparently, now taxation on these products is a setback for India
 bataa den ki bharat jiespi ke tahat america ko 5
 Exports goods worth 6 billion dollars (about 40 thousand crores rupees)
 kyon america ne liya faislamerica ke raashtrapati donald trump kaa kahana he ki bharat se yah bharosa nahin mil paaya he ki vah apane bazaar main america utpaadon ko baraabar kii chhot degaa
 The United States says that due to restrictions in India, it is suffering commercial losses
 unhone kaha ki jo america product bharat jate hai us par kaaphi oonchi dar se shulk lagaaya jaataa he
 Citing the example of America's harley-davidson motorcycle, Trump said, "when we send a motorcycle to India, it is charged at 100 per cent there
" ve hamase 100 fisadi shulk lete hai jabaki bharat hamen motorcycle bhejtaa he tab ham unase kuch bhi shulk nahin vasuulate hai
 According to US law, this change will be applicable 2 months after the notification is issued
 kya he sarkaar kaa kehnahaalanki sarkaar ke ek sheersh adhikari ne kaha ki is faisle se bharat dwaara america ko kiye ja rahe niryaat par bahut adhik prabhaav nahin padegaa
 Commerce Secretary Anoop Wadhawan said that the US 5 under the India GSP
 6 arab dollar (kareeb 39,645 karod rupee) ke saamaanon kaa niryaat karata he
 Only 1 of these
 90 karod dollar mulya ke product hi bina kisi shulk vaali shrenee main aate hai
 Other products are charged a nominal fee
 unhone bataaya ki bharat mukhya rup se kachche maal or jaev rasinic jaisi madhyavarti vastuon kaa niryaat hi america ko karata he
 Explain that India's exports to America are more than imports from there

 inhen party kii ummidavaari ke liye bahumat hasil nahin kar paane kii sthiti main kise ummidavaar bananaa he, yah tay karne kaa bhi haq hota he
 Hillary's vote-populated delegates are those who are chosen at the state or local level
 wo democratic party ke rashtriya sammelan main apane pehle se tay ummidavaar ke paksh main apana mat dete hai
 The number of delegates supporting Hillary will increase further when six states, including the more representative California and New Jersey, compete

 He said that we are close to a historic and unique moment, but we still have work to do, what not to do? He said that we have six elections on Tuesday and we are going to fight hard for every vote here including California

 Mulayam's master strategist was many other leaders in Shivapalup who are looking for a new political base for themselves
 aise hi ek netaa hai mulaayam singh yadav ke chote bhai shivpal singh yadav
 His displeasure with his nephew and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is not hidden from anyone
 mulaayam singh ke sarvesarva rahete hue shivpal ko hi samaajawaadee party kaa master ranneetikaar mana jaataa tha
 It is being told that Shivpal has been in contact with Congress leaders for the last several days

 However, the conversation continues after this
 congress chaahati he ki, shivpal kanpur, mainpuri, itawa or aas paas ke jilon main party ko majboot karne kii zimmedaari uthaaen
 At the same time, Shivpal wants that he should have full responsibility in the state, so that he can show his strength
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is mudde par shivpal kii congress netaaon ke saath baatcheet jari he
 Do not be overwhelmed by Shivpal, Congress is also considering the issue of taking outside leaders along with it, that if there is a need to join hands with other parties in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then there will not be much problem
 sutron ke mutabik, nasimuddin siddiki ko lekar to zyaada duvidha nahin he
 More trouble is there with Shivpal, should Akhilesh not get angry with him and the possibility of a tie-up with the Samajwadi Party in the Lok Sabha elections should not be completely stopped

 Dhoni said, "the phase of aggressive fielding is over
" jis tarah kaa cricket ham khelte the, vah puri tarah se badal chukaa he
 Where, we often saw that it was a common practice to field a player at mid-on
 lekin ab midon par khilaadi kam hi dikhataa he
 During the Delhi Test, a lot of players were lined up in the field and close to the batsmen
 yah ek maanak ban gaya he
 Fielding changes are made quite a lot depending on the mood of the players
 'dhoni ne do captainon dwaara ek hi tarah kii fielding ko lekar raay kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha, 'yadi aap virendra sahvaag ke liye deep therdman, deep panit, deep scaver leg par khilaadi khadaa karte hai to yah ranneeti kehalaati he

 2019 loksabhaa chunaav khatm ho chukaa he or gandhi parivaar ke liye yah chunaav kisi sadame se kam nahin rahaa
 The Congress gained only 8 seats compared to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa main ab congress saansadon kii sankhya 52 ho gai he, jo 2014 main 44 thi
 The party chief Rahul Gandhi himself lost the Amethi Lok Sabha seat to Smriti Irani, which was considered a Congress stronghold
 haalanki rahul ko kerala kii vynad loksabhaa seat par jabardast jeet mili or unhen 706367 vot mili
 But will Rahul Gandhi contest Lok Sabha elections from Amethi again? If you turn the pages of history, Indira Gandhi was defeated by Rae Bareli, after that she did not turn to that area again
 haalanki unke chachaa sanjay gandhi jarur 1977 main amethi se haare lekin 1980 main dobaaraa jitkar sansad pahunche
 Rahul Gandhi's grandmother and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi won from here in the 1967 general elections
 iske baad 1971 ke chunaavon main bhi indira gandhi yahaan se jeetin
 After the declaration of Emergency in 1975, when elections were held in 1977, Indira Gandhi was badly defeated
 janata party ke rajanarayan ne unhen 55,202 voton se karaari shikast di
 After this, Indira Gandhi turned south in the 1978 by-elections and chose Chikmagalur in Karnataka for a seat in Parliament
 is seat ko 1977 main congress ke dibi
 It was won by Chandra Gowda, who later joined the BJP
 seat indira gandhi ke liye khaali kar di gai
 In this election, Indira defeated Virendra Patil of Janata Party
 yah chunaav congress ke liye phir apane paanv par uth khadey hone jaisaa tha
 In 1980 Indira Gandhi again elected the seat of South and the wait ended on the Medak Lok Sabha seat of Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana)
 indira ne yahaan janata party ke kaddavar netaa es jaipal reddy ko maat di
 Interestingly, Indira Gandhi did not turn to Rae Bareli again until 1984 when she remained alive and remained an MP from Medak
 1977 main amethi seat se sanjay gandhi ko janata party ke ravindra pratap singh ke haathon karaari shikast mili
 But three years later, when elections were held in 1980, Sanjay won a landslide victory
 gauratlab he ki saal 1999 main sonia gandhi amethi ke alaava karnataka kii bellari seat se bhi ladi thim
 The Congress then feared that the BJP might go to any extent to prevent entry into Sonia's Parliament
 iske baad sonia gandhi ne amethi seat rahul gandhi ke liye chhod di or khud raibareli chali gayi, jahaan se vah ab tak saansad hai
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see whether Amethi loser Rahul will follow the path of Indira Gandhi or like Sanjay Gandhi will give himself a chance from Amethi again

 ' Even when the BJP had not taken a final decision on Narendra Modi contesting elections from Uttar Pradesh in March 2014, party general secretary in-charge of the state Amit Shah was clear that Modi would have to contest from the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh
 unhone tatkaaleen party adhyaksh rajnath singh se isaki sifarish kii
 Rajnath Singh, who counted himself among the top leaders of Uttar Pradesh, was not particularly enthusiastic
 unhone sawaal kiya ki party adhyaksh or pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar donon kaa ek hi rajya se chunaav laduya kya thik hoga
 Shah did not respond and moved on to the next issue
 baithak khatm hui to shah ne phir anurodh kiya ki rajnath singh ab unke suzav par gaur karen
 The matter remained where it was
 rajnath singh sochate rahe or bich kaa rasta nikaalane kii koshish main modi ke liye patna seat par vichaar karte rahe kyonki bihar bhi utana hi mahatvapurn tha
 But Shah is habitually opposed to such agreements
 shaayad apane duusare pramukh gunon ke saath is gun kii vajah se bhi ve modi ke kripapaatr hai
 Shah came to this conclusion after a very deep study
 unhen vishwaas tha ki uttar pradesh main jati or dharm ke pechida jaal se paar paane ke liye bijepi ke saamne ek hi rasta he ki modi lahar paidaa kii jaae or use lagaataar hawa di jaae
 With the instigation of the prime ministerial candidate, Shah reminded his suggestion and kept reminding him again and again
 ant main unhone maan liya ki unka suzav sweekaar ho gaya he or aglaa sawaal daag diya—adhyaksh ji kahaan se laduya chaahate hai? kuch hi saptaah main yah mudda sir ke bal khadaa ho gaya or ab rajnath singh apana nirvachan kshetra tay karne ko chatapataane lage
 There were moments of panic when such suggestions were received that Rajnath Singh should contest from Jharkhand
 unke pairokaron ne furti dikhaai or atal bihari vaajepayi kii viraasat sanjone ke naam par lakhanu hathiyaa liya
 Modi is confident of Shah's decisions and praises his quality of uniting day and night to achieve success after approval
 shah ne apane bos ko uttar pradesh fatah karke de diya
 The BJP and Apna Dal alliance won a record 73 seats out of 80
 ab party main shah kaa kad baduya tay tha
 Modi began to pursue his candidature
 party ke bheetar or aresas ke kuch netaaon kaa virodh tha ki pradhanmantri or party adhyaksh donon gujarat se nahin ho sakate or shah par farji muthbhed main logon kii hatya kaa mukadmaa bhi chal rahaa he
 But no one can stand in front of Modi's argument that the states that BJP wants to win, is there a more capable leader to win? President kk's favorite Amit Shah is the youngest president of BJP at the age of 49
 unke gaddinshin hone ke saath hi aane vaale dinon main party kaa cheharaa jawan hone ke asaar hai
 Some insiders say that Modi clearly thinks that the party should enhance the relationship with younger voters and strengthen the recent success
 lekin shah ko bijepi kaa nayaa adhyaksh banaae jane ke peeche yuva sanghathan to sirf ek makasad he
 His appointment has triple implications
 ek, ve modi ke sabase kareebi sahyogi hai or unki niyukti se party par pradhanmantri kii pakad puri ho jaati he jisase dilli mandali ke un netaaon kaa varchasv samaapt ho gaya he jo 2004 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main kamyaabi na dilaa paane ke baavjood rasta chhodie ko taiyaar nahin the
 Secondly, the appointment of Shah has paved the way for the organization to get rid of the elderly leaders who no longer see any utility
 or tisare, sabase ahm yah he ki uttar pradesh main shah ne sabit kar diya ki ve aresas ko saath lekar bhi modi kaa aadesh lagu karne main samarth hai
 He adopted Modi's management style and supported the organizational capability of the Sangh and used technology cleverly in it
 shah ko 9 july ko bijepi adhyaksh ghoshit kiye jane se do din pehle sangh ke varisht prachaarkon, 49 varshiya ram madhav or 50 varsh ke aasapaas ke shiv prakaash ko bhi bijepi main shaamil kiya gaya
 Shiv Prakash has worked with Shah in western Uttar Pradesh as a field campaigner and Ram Madhav has dominated the media for a decade as an RSS spokesperson
 ram madhav ko abhi tak koi nishchit bhoomika nahin di gai he, lekin ve party padaadhikariyon ke saath shah kii har baithak main maujuud rahete hai
 Madhav was also present during preliminary discussions with BJP units of the four states, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, to be held in the next six months
 shah kaa lakshya he ki inamen se kam-se-kam teen rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar bane
 The party also wants to strengthen the unprecedented gains in Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Kerala
 uttar pradesh bijepi adhyaksh lakshmikant bajepayi kehete hai, “shah ke paas sirf duuradrushti hi nahin balki drudh sankalp or faislon par turant amal karne kii kshamta bhi he
 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are due in 2017 but we have held a meeting about them
 agali baithak main ham tikat baantne kii sharton par vichaar karenge
 "shah takes orders directly from Modi, so there is no possibility of the party and government going in different directions
" bijepi ne mahasachiv 48 varshiya pi
 a policy implementation team has been formed under the leadership of Muralidhar Rao, who will monitor whether the government policy is being implemented on the key promises and manifesto issues made during the Lok Sabha elections
 phir bhi kuch netaaon ke man main shankaaen hai jo aajkal dabi jabaan main jaahir ho rahi he
 Says a party general secretary, "they take orders directly from Modi and tell their trustees
 isse kaary-kushalta ke naam par netritv kii jagah ek chota gut le legaa
 "technology ride: a close look at Amit Shah's victory strategy in Uttar Pradesh clearly shows that he will use technology heavily to revive the party system
" unhone party ke lakhanu karyaalay kii kaaya palat di he
 An IT cell has been created to capture the war room and social media enthusiasts, especially first-time voters, to plan the upcoming war
 lakhanu main shah ke war room ko chalaane main madad ke liye aresas se aae 44 varshiya sunil bansal kaa kahana he, “pichley aam chunaav main desh main kareeb 11 karod nae matadaata aae
 BJP and RSS believed that these new voters can turn the wind
 ” bijepi ne apane war room main ek kol centre bhi kholaa tha jisase do lakshya saadhe gaye
 Party sympathizers and supporters could give a missed call to the call center's number to get information about the party's programs
 kol centre ke kaaryakartaaon ne missd kol dene vaale 20,000 se adhik logon ko party kaa sakriy kaaryakarta bana liya
 It has been revealed that new IT systems are being discovered to help improve the election profile from the headquarters

 Just 20 days after Muthuvel Karunanidhi was buried on Marina beach, the Dravida Munnetra Kadagam (DMK) favored the late son of the party's favorite son M
 ke
 Stalin was crowned as his successor
 chennai main party ke mukhyalay anna arivalayam main party kii general council ne 28 agast ko 65 varshiya stallin ko party kaa nayaa adhyaksh chun liya
 This third son of Karunanidhi entered politics during the 1967 assembly election campaign when he was just 14 years old and studying in school
 us chunaav main dramuk ne congress ko tamilnadu se sthaayee taur par baahar kar diya tha
 Stalin is the party's relatively youngest president, but the party still has the entire system of older people
 95 varshiya ke
 Ambazhagan has been the general secretary of the party since 1977
 abhi tak pradhan sachiv rahe 70 varshiya duraimurugan ko nayaa koshadhyaksh chunaa gaya
 Apparently, after years of working under his father's umbrella, Stalin is avoiding any tampering with the party leadership — he grew up working with all these veteran leaders
 unhone adhyaksh chune jane ke baad party kii praathamiktaaon kaa elaan kiya
 In his first speech as party president, he called on the DMK cadres to "teach a lesson to Narendra Modi's government" and evict the "right-wing" government from the Center
 yah 2019 main vipaksh ke mahagathbandhan ke liye utsahjanak ghoshnaa he
 Many believe that Stalin's path will be different from his father's democratic and consensus-oriented approach
 is saal march main unhone jila str ke padaadhikariyon or dramuk ke caderon se kaha tha, "agar aap chaahate hai ki party aage bade to aapako ab mere taanaashaahee taur-tareekon ko sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Indiscipline and anti-party activities in the party will not be tolerated at all
 '' party ke sarvesarva ke taur par stallin pita ke die hue apane naam ko sahi sabit kar sakate hai (yahaan tak ki unka or rus ke taanashaah stallin kaa janmdin bhi ek he)
 Meanwhile Stalin's elder brother M
 ke
 Alagiri, who was expelled from the party in 2014, wants to make his way again
 unhone chetaya he ki nayaa netritv (stallin ke adheen) unhen party main lene se manaa karata he to iske "gambhir nattejey'' honge
 It is believed that Stalin's half-sister Kanimoli will play his eye and ear in Delhi, just as Mursoli Maran and his son Dayanidhi Maran played for Karunanidhi
 chennai ke vishleshak en
 Satya Murthy says that there is no challenge for Stalin in the DMK but outside the party "he has to emerge as a leader who can win the party in elections
" ''karunanidhi jab adhik vruddh ho chuke the (khaskar 2011 ke baad se) to unki jagah par stallin kaa prabandhan acha nahin rahaa he
 Since she took over the reins of the party, the DMK has lost two consecutive assembly elections and in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, she was very clear
 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha ke do aagaamee upachunaav stallin ke liye apni kaabiliyat sabit karne kaa sahi mauka honge
 In this, they have to prove their merit in selecting the right candidates and forming alliances
 tamilnadu main karunanidhi or jayalalita, donon ke nidhan ke baad chunavi sameekaran badal rahe hai
 39 Lok Sabha seats: Fifty-fifth state with the highest number of seats, Tamil Nadu will play an important role in the formation of government in Delhi
 vishleshkon ke mutabik, agar ve sahi gathjod or sahi ummidavaaron kaa chunaav karte hai to acha mol-bhav kar sakate hai
 Many believe that Stalin can do this
 unki pahchaan mehnatee netaa ke taur par he or caderon main acha sammaan he
 His "namakku Naame" (from us, for us) roadshow before the 2016 assembly elections attracted a lot of people, especially young voters outside the party
 lekin stallin samvaad ke maamle main kamjor or caderon ke liye sahaj uplabdh nahin rahe hai
 Now, after becoming president, he has to change his habit and be available to the people
 madras uniwarsity main raajnneeti shastri raamu manivannan maanate hai, "gambhir swabhaav or dikhavebaaji se duuri, donon unki takat hai par kamajori bhi
 Under no circumstances do they show haste or panic

 If they choose the alliance and candidates correctly, then they can have a good bargain in 2019 *** tiwari ne kaha, ‘yadi sahitya academy bhi isamen kud jaae or abhivyakti kii aazaadee par pabandi kaa virodh karnaa shuru kar de to kya vah apane mul kaary se nahin bhatak jaaegi
